A little of this. A measure of that.
Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . . drawn
from the largest and finest reserves
in the world. That’s why the subtle
excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy
in the district of Cognac before
Napoleon was born.
Hennessy Cognac is distilled and

GIVING CREDIT
AFTER THE SENATE elections Mr.
Holt gave this fascinating quote when
asked to comment on the DLP gains:
“And here we have a political party
which so far has not gained one seat
in the House of Representatives.”
Many people found this surprising.
They thought the Liberal Party had
gained at least 20 seats in the House
of Representatives as a result of the
DLP.
KEEPING UP YOUR SPIRITS
THE PRESBYTERIAN BOARD of
Christian Education has issued an order
of service which is being used around
Melbourne churches. On page two of
the sheet we come to the line:
“The voices: We live in the worlds
of shame. We are the alcoholics, the
drug addicts, the prisoners. Our eyes
fall before you and we dare not ask
you to be our brothers.
“People of the church: You need not
ask, for we accept you without petition
. . . Come with us to the altar and let
us pray together: God, give us
courage.”
The Bulletin respectfully suggests
to the board that in view of the new
brewery being built in Melbourne, the
form of service should be changed. It
seems to give Courage an unfair ad-
vantage.
THE MAHARISHI'S MAGIC WAND
WHEN WE ASKED a colleague
where the publicity woman for the
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was staying,
we were told: “At the Wentworth, and
she’s in meditation for a week.” But
next day, we managed to catch her
between trances: Mrs. Edna Linnell, a
former opera singer, who had flown
to Australia to help the Maharishi in
his lecture tour, paying her own fare.
“I was at home in London watching
my TV when I saw him interviewed
by the Bishop of Downside,” she told
us. “Suddenly I knew my search was
ended. Everything I had wanted to
know was revealed. I knew now how
to develop the fullest potential of my
being. How to enjoy life to the fullest
degree.
“I went to one of his lectures, and
I was initiated into transcendental
meditation. Now I am a helper. We are
not allowed any publicity of our own:
it is stipulated that only the Mahar-
ishi will be mentioned. Has he helped
me? I can’t describe how much. I’ve
not slept for four nights on a migrant
plane I tell you, they just bundle
them in like cattle, children scream-
ing but I’m relaxed, you see. In the
Spiritual Regeneration Movement of
Australia there are many members,
especially in Melbourne. Thirty
minutes with the Maharishi? In 15
minutes he will reveal so much wisdom
to you that will be quite enough. You
really must have 30 minutes? Well,
I would want nothing to sully your
experience with the Maharishi, so per-
haps . . .”
We saw him for 25 minutes, finally,
in his room at the Wentworth, squatting
in lotus position on a deerskin on a
twin bed, a transcendental bundle of
mischief with a crumpled-looking
bouquet of lilies and carnations at his
side, his hair flowing over his shoulders
and his brown eyes as humorously
sharp and knowing as a clever child’s.
He was quietly triumphant, enjoying
his success like a bag of humbugs.
He fingered a long pink prayer-bead
necklace while a woman reporter asked
him eager questions like “Have you
any message that can help Australia’s
lonely and unhappy women?” and
“How important is laughter to you?”
As we talked to him, a nervous
waiter wheeled in a trolley covered in
silver dishes: a guru’s lunch of potatoes
and broccoli served in the grand man-
ner. He tucked in with a will. “In 1958
I started the Spiritual Regeneration
Movement in Madras. There was some
interest there, certainly, but after six
months I began to realise it was going
to take two centuries to get the idea of
transcendental meditation across at the
rate I was going!” He laughed up-
The Maharishi ... how important is
laughter?
roariously, and his disciples chimed in
obediently only a fraction of a second
later. “I decided to go to the country
where there were more individuals than
in any other country; where they were
one step ahead.” And that was? “The
United States. I knew it was the most
scientifically advanced country and in
the habit of trying new things. I flew
to Hawaii.
“I looked around the island. I was
walking along the beach one night
when I noticed a man was following
me. He followed me, and followed me
-- for three blocks. Finally, he said to
me, ‘Are you from India?’ I said,
‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Would you speak?’
And I told him, ‘Not professionally.
But if there are some people of the
right inclination, gather them together.’
He did, and many people came for
initiation right away.
“And all those Americans in Hawaii

on holiday from the mainland, soon
they started to bring word of me to
the rest of the United States. New
York, tough? No, they responded, you
see, to the idea of ‘200 percent life.’
That means that they get 100 percent
material value and 100 percent spiritual
from transcendental meditation.” They
don’t have to give up anything then?
No abnegation?
“No. That’s been taught for thou-
sands of years and it’s all wrong. People
can do exactly what they want and
still get the benefits of meditation.”
Quite a bill of goods, then, and who
gave him the initial financial help to
deliver it? “A man with the Bell Tele-
phone Company. Then I took transcen-
dental meditation to London. But that
was not so good. The Londoners re-
sponded in much too leisurely a
fashion. They attended the talks well
enough, but when it came to medita-
tion, they weren’t so interested. Then
someone said to me, ‘If you go to
Sweden and do well there you will im-
press them in London. If you can be
successful, in Sweden you can be suc-
cessful anywhere.
“I went to Sweden, and something I
said at a lecture worked. I said, ‘Sup-
pose you have an orange on a table.
Suppose you want to preserve the
beauty of an orange and at the same
time you want to preserve its juice.
If you peel the orange you will spoil
it. But here is a technique of enjoying
both. You take a pin and probe to the
very depths of the orange. Keep on
doing it until the juice comes out drop
by drop. Now the Swedes saw how to
draw out of themselves more energy,
intelligence, and happiness. One hun-
dred and fifty people were initiated!
Then London became enthusiastic.”
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi smiled trium-
phantly. “Now our headquarters is
there!”
He had met the Beatles at the Lon-
don Hilton, where he had given a
talk. “The boys pulled the curtain aside
and came and sat down with me on the
stage. I said to them, ‘You have a
magic wand. Use it now for the good
of the greatest number.’ I told them,
‘You must experience meditation and
then you can teach it.’ They are coming
to me to learn to teach after Christmas.
Australians? More simple, innocent and
good than other peoples . . .”
What, we. asked, was the significance
of the deerskin he sat on, and of the
flowers? “The deerskin I’d rather not
say, or everyone will want to buy one
before they learn to meditate, and that
will mean fewer initiates, won’t it? The
flowers? They are 200 percent of life,
100 percent outer material bliss, and
100 percent spiritual honey.” And he
went down to the Press conference,
where another sheaf of 200 percent of
life was set beside him — in a cham-
pagne bucket. “Shall I,” a woman next
to us at the conference kept saying,
“address him as Your Holiness?”
— CHARLES HIGHAM
FRONT-LINE
DOING BATTLE with an appropriate
range of attendant mishaps, ABC tele-
vision’s “Contrabandits” unit filmed
episode 13 last week before breaking
for the Christmas recess.
One of the last scenes was shot in a
Sydney bowling alley where a group
of middle-aged women bowlers were
finishing a competition, oblivious to the
cameras and to John Gregg’s efforts at
questioning a chain-smoking informant.
Between takes, the producer, Eric
Tayler, wearing orange-and-black bowl-
ing shoes and a slight stoop, recited
“Contrabandits’ ” episode of accidents.
The stoop, he explained, was the com-
bined effect of a slipped disc and a
carbuncle on the back of his neck,
and was matched by John Bonney’s
black eye and a film editor’s sprained
ankle.
The film editor had fallen down a
pothole in the dark, while John Bon-
ney’s black eye was the byproduct of a
chase sequence, filmed on one of the
rare days when the weather had been
neither cyclonic nor around the cen-
tury. “After that, you can understand
how we felt when we found ourselves
filming in hangar number 13 the day
we were doing airport scenes.”
But, at the moment, “Contrabandits”
can afford a little bad luck. It is ending
its first season with generous helpings
of applause from the critics and a seem-
ingly secure future resuming in
March with an episode set on a
New Zealand-bound passenger ship.
So last week, Eric Tayler was even
more reassuringly calm than usual, and
he.admitted most people’s minds were
firmly focused on their holidays.
“Dennis Quilley and his family are
spending Christmas in England, John
Bonney’s talking about going to India,
and John Gregg is going into a pro-
duction of Feydeau’s play, ‘A Flea
in Her Ear’ at the Union Theatre in
Melbourne.”
The series, he said, had remained
well within its “adequate” budget dur-
ing the year, although the location film-
ing has gradually increased. “We did
one episode completely on location
at Ulladulla and that cost us $13,00Q
only $3OOO more than usual. That
was possible because we’d managed to
save money on earlier episodes.”
Tayler’s regret is that so far the
series has failed to establish a per-
manent pool of scriptwriters, although
70 people have worked on scripts
throughout the season. “The series has
been thrown open to anyone who’s ever
put pen to paper but we’re nowhere
near to getting three or four people
we can use permanently. Of course,
it takes a long time for people to learn
to write for a new medium. It took a
long while for it to happen in England.
But I’m finding that some aspiring
scriptwriters here don’t even have a
television set. They’re too busy writing
for television to watch it.”
BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Around the turn
and straight
into the red
DEAR READER, YOU MAY feel that
the last Senate election was a vigorous
affair, but what a tame little thing it
was compared with an election for the
Victoria Racing Club. There is a
vacancy for the VRC committee com-
ing up on December 11. For this, five
candidates are now waged in deadly
battle.
One candidate is Harry Mackna-
mara, a former president of Werribee
Racing Club. He has installed himself
in Suite 34 at the Southern Cross
Hotel just so that he can securely con-
duct his campaign. Batman called in
there at campaign headquarters. Three
gentlemen, including Mr. Macknamara,
were working there in their shirt-
sleeves. Mr. Macknamara said he had
been loaned the suite at no cost by a
friend. Already they had sent out a
letter to every member of the VRC
and now they were making a personal
call on the telephone to every VRC
member they knew.
Racing, of course, is a deadly serious
matter in Victoria. Every horse, trotter,
or dog actually runs on behalf of Sir
Henry. Nothing else in the State is
so productive. It provides ten percent
of all the State-raised income.
, It is generally considered that horse-
racing is instinctively part of the Great
Australian Character, and if one had
to put one’s faith in great solidly based
Australian institutions, one would pick
perhaps BHP first, the Victoria Racing
Club second, and the Myer Emporium
third.
But the truth is that never has there
been such a crisis. The two major
metropolitan clubs, as one racing writer
put it, are to all intents and purposes,
flat, motherless, broke. The VRC,
which controls Flemington, has an over-
draft of $849,000, and the Victoria
Amateur Turf Club, which is anything
but amateur, and has Caulfield and
Sandown, is in the red for $3,567,671.
One would have thought the TAB was
the most marvellous idea ever invented
for getting racing clubs out of trouble,
but apparently it is more marvellous
for Sir Henry than for the clubs. In
four years the metropolitan clubs have
declared a profit of only $400,000.

Meanwhile, the State has received $24
million.
So the VRC as a result of all this
has put in a report to the Government
and these are the main recommenda-
tions: a merger between the VRC and
the Moonee Valley Club. Closure of the
close-to-the-city -tracks, Cranbourne,
Werribee, and Yarra Glen, and the
transfer of their mid-week dates to
Moonee Valley and Sandown. The
report also recommended amalgama-
tion of a number of country clubs.
The most savagely controversial
recommendation was the mid-week
racing bit. Sydney has had mid-week
racing for years, but Sir Henry ex-
ploded with an immediate “no.”
Back before the war we saw nothing
sinister in mid-week racing. We had
154 race meetings plus pony meetings
in the metropolitan area. Then in order
to defeat Hitler we stopped mid-week
racing and cut down the number of
metropolitan meetings to 65. Pony
races went altogether.
Immediately after the war, the Gov-
ernment decided to continue the ban.
A couple of mid-week meetings were
allowed at Werribee in 1948, but it was
not until 1953 that the Government
brought down a Bill to allow mid-week
meetings at courses within 30 miles of
Melbourne.
The Churches considered mid-week
racing almost as sinful as liquor and
lotteries. The World Council of
Churches called for mass protests. But
the main argument against mid-week
racing was that it would cause
absenteeism and the Churches had the
superb alliance of the Chamber of
Commerce. Said the president, Mr.
W. J. Allison: “I would like to see mid-
week meetings wiped out completely.
" We must support primary
industry...!”
Australia would be much healthier
economically if only part of the time
spent trying to pick mid-week winners
were devoted to production.”
So, on Wednesdays we weren’t
allowed to go a.w.l. from work to
Moonee Valley or Caulfield, but it was
all right if we went a.w.l. and drove 30
miles to Cranbourne or Werribee.
Mr. P. J. Clarey, on behalf of the
workers, pointed out that before the
war there were between eight and
ten percent unemployed in Melbourne.
If anyone thought the unemployed
went to the races, they were crazy.
It was the rich who went to mid-week
races, and from his experience at a
mid-week meeting you could always
find a splendid array of top Mel-
burnian executives who felt that on
a Wednesday this relaxation was utterly
necessary. Mr. Clarey also rudely asked
if it was all right to have a mid-week
meeting at Flemington on the first
Tuesday in November.
This time nobody has mentioned the
fearful problem of absenteeism at city
factories and we haven’t heard from
the World Council of Churches. It has
become a straight-out battle for sur-
vival of the country clubs. As men-
tioned earlier, Werribee has its candi-
date for the VRC committee. Yarra
Glen has appointed a public relations
officer, and the Port Phillip District
Racing Association, which controls the
near-country tracks, has issued a fiery
manifesto of battle. It accuses the VRC
of “misconceptions, bias, and lack of
business acumen.”
The country courses, like Cranbourne
and Werribee, have just spent $BOO,OOO
on improvements, so their lack of
enthusiasm for being liquidated is not
surprising. However, most of the racing
writers, like the “Herald’s” Jack Elliott,
are behind the VRC. They find it
absurd that they should have to drive
past the closed gates of beautiful tracks
like Moonee Valley, then 48 miles on
to Kyneton or 39 miles to Woodend.
Then tracks like Flemington, which
indisputably is among the first half-
dozen in the world, gets only 17 club
meetings a year. It is unused for two
months after the Melbourne Cup.
Actually, the Government would
dearly love to be out of this racing
wrangle. The Country Party is right
behind the small country racing clubs,
and the Government will not give mid-
week racing to the VRC and VATC
for fear of annoying the country vote.
Sir Herbert Hyland, in the Legislative
Assembly, has called for a full-scale
inquiry into racing before a supreme
judge and this undoubtedly would be
the answer. Meanwhile, the Govern-
ment has introduced a Bill to allow the
TAB to operate on races like the Eng-
lish Derby, and also for greyhound
race meetings to have betting on dog
events held elsewhere.
Not very vital matters, you will
agree, but they do help to boost the
turnover on which our economy is
based.

Preparing for
the second
time round
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
MISS EAGER, A BLONDE in thigh-
high orange, pins “Reserved for Inter-
state Artists” on a chain hanging from
the wall, steps back in her orange patent
shoes, then forward again to readjust
the balance. She’s not sure what her
status is here at Herman van der
Made’s Gallery 100, which is over
Lorenzini’s bistro in William Street,
Sydney. One minute she was downstairs
drinking wine, bored, fed to the teeth,
wondering what to do till she started
teaching art next February; the next,
Hank, who owns the bistro, says, go
upstairs, there’s work to do.
Miss Eager clumps back to the office
where her architect employer is doubled
over a typewriter, bashing out stick-on
labels and prices with two fingers: if
nothing else, he says, he’d make a
beautiful typist. Actually, he would. He
is tall, good looking, 32, and endowed
with a wild head of curls which have
not been cut for some time. Everyone
misunderstands Herman van der Made.
. He wonders, sometimes, why it is he
cannot put himself across to people, his
English isn’t quite so bad, huh? He is
Dutch, but he has lived in Australia
seven years. Right now, no one will
believe that this idea of a workshop
where artists, established or otherwise,
can exhibit experimental work free from
the beastly ties of money comes from
the heart; that he is not in it to make
money for himself. Hank, who is also
knocking out labels, lifts an eyebrow.
He knows nothing about art, but it’s his
building, for Heaven’s sake.
Tonight is the opening of what the
Dutchman calls his humble second time
around. First time, a year ago, he
launched the workshop in the grand
manner: 750 invitations went out, Sir
Charles Moses gave it his blessing, say-
ing it was a beautiful idea, and tbe
party went on and on until one in the
morning. Then followed an ambitious
program of art and design exhibitions,
music recitals, poetry and play readings.
But artists are human and erratic. Their
output waned. So this time, he sends
out 250 invitations, has no one to
speechify, and shows common or garden
prints with a few sculptures thrown in
as a surprise. And there is sherry.
Hank suddenly rises and says he must
go downstairs. His place at the type-
writer is taken by John Allan, editor of
Masque, who does know something
about art, but has terrible trouble with
his spelling. Who can spell Schehera-
zade? Don Quixote? Mr. Allan’s eyes,
hidden by long, straight hair, cannot
read Herman van der Made’s writing
“. . . terracotta, it’s terracotta. You
must put terracotta.” But why? asks
Gerry von Putten, a beautiful sculptor
with no confidence, whose work it is,
why? “So they’ll know what it is, old
boy.”
Actually, Mr. van der Made’s first
year was not entirely wasted; he did
achieve a mailing list of 1200 people.
Sixty percent of which, he noticed with
relish, were at Kym Bonython’s gallery
opening, where he went minus black tie.
He also noticed that none of them
looked at the objets d’art. They only
looked to see who was there.
It is this sort of insensitive behaviour
that makes his blood boil. And the way
people talk of art as investments. Did
you see that terrible piece in the paper
the other day? They’re all at it. It’s
enough, says Mr. van der Made, reach-
ing for his Drum tobacco, to make him
sick. It is possible, please, not 1 to get
a packet cigarette out every time he
starts rolling one? What people are
buying now are names, not art, and
artists have to, how we say, talk
turkey to be able to sell their work.
Show him one who can. There is no
such person. Miss Eager, would you
take the sherry round, please?
Someone announces that critic Laurie
Thomas is here and Mr. van der Made
pulls a pleased, incredulous face. He
has finished his labels. Puts on his
jacket. Shoves in his tobacco pouch.
Turns up the Mozart. A thought
crosses his mind and he pulls out an old
invitation to a charity opening held
here a month earlier. At the time it
seemed a good idea to co-operate, you
know, charity and art going hand in
hand. Never again. That people, real
human beings, could behave so badly
in an art gallery appals him.
There is a lady outside in gripping
trousers saying, “That’s lovely, Shirl, isn’t
it?” Shirl wants to step back to get the,
what do they call it? the perspection.
There’s a nice little crowd building up
of the gallery-opening sort. Some
bearded gentlemen in homespun tweed.
Some spectacled women, earnest and
intense, discussing jam-making over
Gerry’s terracotta. Some teenagers
drinking sherry with abandon. A girl
in draughtboard-check silk stockinette
trouser-suit lugging an outsize
crocheted haversack. Mr. van der Made
surveys them from his lofty six-foot
height. No, he can’t say any of these
were at the Bonython opening. He is
not downhearted. There is an old
Dutch saying that keeps him going: you
cannot catch a mouse in one hole.

Taken from
the Gheysens
Collection
Lady in a Hat on the Beach. William Dobell
Two Jewish Boys. Russell Drysdale
THESE ARE SOME of the paintings stolen from
the house of Mr. Camille Gheysens, of Wollstonecraft,
Sydney, last month. Dobell’s Lady in a Hat on the
Beach and Drysdale’s Two Jewish Boys are two of
the most noted items of Mr. Gheysens’ extensive
collection.
In all, 39 paintings and sketches were taken, includ-
ing 18 Dobell paintings, four Dobell watercolors, and
one Dobell crayon sketch, and works by Picasso,
Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec, Nolan, Drysdale, and
Norman Lindsay.
Although Mr. Gheysens valued the stolen paintings
at something like $200,000, the thieves hardly dis-
turbed the living-room of his house, the walls of which
are still lined with paintings. And if, perhaps, Bob
Dickerson is chagrined that the thieves took none of


his paintings, Mr. Gheysens himself is rather sad that
they valued other men’s work above his own.
Mr. Gheysens, who came to Australia from Belgium
about 40 years ago, is a wool-buyer, but has poured
great energy and time into musical composition. Last
year he prepared a catalogue of his works to date.
These number 555 pieces and the manuscripts are all
neatly filed in his living-room. There are 14 sym-
phonies and 351 compositions for piano solo.
Random items include three piano solos dedicated
to Sir William Dobell, At Wangi, Dobelius, and At
Lake Macquarie, and a rhapsody on three notes dedi-
cated to Sir Charles Moses. The three notes are A, B,
and C.
Mr. Gheysens’ music is not frequently performed.
Belgian Interior. William Dobell
However, he has recorded some of it, providing his
own orchestra, which was conducted by Isadore
Goodman. Most conductors, Mr. Gheysens points out,
prefer to stick to familiar music, or music which they
have already heard on disc, so there are few problems
of interpretation.
Mr. Gheysens began collecting Australian paint-
ings more than 25 years ago and bought some: of his
early Dobells for the legendary £2O or £3O. Sir
William is a close friend. Portraits of Mr. Gheysens
by Dobell, Nora Heysen, Jon Molvig, and Dickerson
have been exhibited in the Archibald. Bob Dickerson
will use him as a subject again next year.
Police circulated copies of the stolen paintings here
and overseas. Most similar thefts in Australia have
ended happily for the owners.

How to put the smile
back on Mr. Holt’s face
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
MR. HOLT IS TO BE applauded on
the quick remaking of the Ministry
he unexpectedly announced yesterday.
It is doubtful if he would have been
so bold if it had not been for the
Senate voting figures, but what is the
use of such elections if it isn’t to stimu-
late governments?
It is hard to know which of his
changes most to praise. Perhaps it is the
decision to bundle the five Service
Ministries into one Defence Depart-
ment, with a Defence Minister and two
Assistant Ministers. Perhaps it is the
selective ruthlessness of his sackings,
and his replacement of the sacked men
with new Ministers who have shown
some sign of having brains as well as
party loyalty. Perhaps it is the way
in which he has ignored the tradition
of seeing that all the States and both
Houses are represented in Cabinet on
the “fair go” principle. Perhaps it is
the unprecedented boldness of his
decision to bring into Cabinet a dis-
tinguished outsider, not yet even in
Parliament, and the courage of thereby
causing a by-election, even if it is in a
safe seat. Perhaps it is in his equally
unprecedented announcement that five
backbenchers are ready to resign their
seats so that new kinds of men can
enter Parliament.
The departure of no fewer than five
Ministers was as significant a token of
the times as the belated entry of Mr.
Wentworth into the Ministry. The
recalling of Sir Alex Downer from
London showed a keen sense of priority
and the despatch there of Mr. Hasluck
as Resident Minister is a special delight.
One looks forward to reading his
weekly lectures to the English on their
lack of interest in the future of those
underdeveloped countries from whom
they drew, in the past, so much wealth
and so much self-importance.
Particular significance can also be
attached to the speech with which the
new External Affairs Minister an-
nounced his determination that Aus-
tralia should play a greater and more
constructive role among its neighbors.
Also welcome (if true) is the uncon-
firmed report that a special sub-
committee of Cabinet will be set up to
break the Treasury’s continuing sabo-
tage of the imaginative aid proposals
that come from the External Affairs
Department. There are even rumors
that this sub-committee will expand its
work to increase the possibility that
policy for the armed services, external
trade, and immigration, as well as
economic assistance, should become
more clearly related to general diplo-
matic policy.
One did not even notice whether Mr.
Holt was smiling or not when he
made his speech on TV telling us what
he thought of the future of Australia,
the kind of people we were, and what
we should do with ourselves. It was
the substance of his speech that held
attention, along with the unexpected
directness and liveliness of its ex-
pression. With its opening out of new
horizons for Australian initiative it may
prove to be one of those speeches, the
last of which was made by John Curtin
in December, 1941, that go on being
quoted forever as dramatisations of a
change in direction. He was wise not
to score off Mr. Whitlam or the Labor
Party directly. It was obvious enough
that he had shown a flexibility that
would be impossible in a Labor Gov-
ernment. In one day’s work he has
made the Labor Party seem the old-hat
party.
. . . ONCE AGAIN, bored with what
doesn’t happen, this column begins by
pretending that something, after all,
did happen. Something that would be
good not only for Australia but in
which there would obviously also be
party political advantage. Presumably,
Mr. Holt will get around to patching up
his Ministry. But how long is he going
to take about it? How far is he going
to go? What sense of new purpose will
come out of the changes?
The most depressing memory of the
VIP affair was the sheer silliness of
most of the Ministers who got mixed
up in it, apart from Senator Gorton,
and (in a minor role) Mr. Hasluck.
The others seemed like salesmen who
were working on the wrong marketing
objective. There was a shallow flashi-
ness in their actions that suggested a
dimness of wit that seems ominous for
the conduct of our affairs. Perhaps
there are too many old pals in the
Ministry, reinforcing each other in their
triviality. The Government of Australia
is not a sales convention and its Min-
isters should seem more than sales pro-
moters.
Mr. Holt should be looking around
for men of more solid intellectual sub-
stance than some of those he has got.
Not necessarily “intellectual” in the
egghead sense, but in the sense that
they can decide what on earth they are
being Ministers for and what their
Departments are supposed to be about,
so that then, having some sense of pur-
pose, they can employ those techniques
of rationality that are supposed to be
the distinguishing characteristics of the
modern mind.

Mr. Calwell
comes back to
stir the pot
OPPOSITION LEADER Gough Whit*
lam is to get an unwelcome Christmas
present in the shape of the return to
Australia of Arthur Augustus Calwell,
former Labor Leader, from a six
months’ trip to Russia, Britain, and
Europe.
So far Whitlam has had it easy.
Labor’s Left Wing has let him have
his head. They knew that it would be
too dangerous to confront him in the
early stages of his leadership and they
were probably also prepared to test
and benefit from Whitlam’s electoral
appeal. So they allowed Whitlam to
expound unchallenged a version of
ALP policy on Vietnam that watered
down the policy approved at the ALP
Federal Conference in Adelaide. And
they even kept quiet when suggestions
were made that the ALP should con*
sider a Senate and an electoral arrange*
ment with the Democratic Labor Party.
But the Left Wing’s period under*
ground was clearly only temporary.
The Left Wing did not want anything
to go wrong in the Senate elections, as
the Senate is the real seat of its parlia-
mentary power. But with the election?
over, the Left Wing can again play a
role above ground.
Now Calwell is coming back to
Australia to stir the pot. He has an-
nounced that he is not going to let the
Vietnam issue go into cold-storage. It is
going to be harder for Whitlam to
put forward an interpretation of ALP
policy on this subject, which softens
the hard line of the Adelaide ALP
Conference, when Calwell is saying
what the decision was and how it must
be implemented by a future Labor
Government.
Moreover, Calwell plans to turn the
heat on that section of the Labor Party
—clearly, in Calwell’s mind, a section
closely associated with the Whitlam
forces —which (realistically, in view of
the manner in which the DLP revealed
it holds the political balance of power
nationally) is wistfully yearning to do
a deal with the DLP. Calwell will not
have a bar of the DLP. In Calwell’s
view a significant number of them are
crypto-Fascists, and there are sufficient
in the ALP who hold a similar view to
cause a further enormous split within
the ALP if the Whitlam forces persist
in trying to make a deal.
It can be argued that Calwell, now
71, and a man who led the Labor
Party to a succession of electoral de-
feats, is a spent force. This is prob-
ably true of the Federal Parliamentary
Labor Party, where those who want to
stay in Parliament prefer the superior
electoral appeal of Whitlam to Cal-
well’s proved ability to lose an elec-

REID
tion. In the caucus Whitlam can un-
doubtedly do-over the older man.
But the Labor caucus is not the only
power point in the Labor Party. In
fact, these days it is a relatively unim-
portant power point. The ALP Federal
Conference is supreme in policy-making
and the ALP Federal Executive is the
supreme governing body between con-
ferences and behaves as such. In addi-
tion, ALP State conferences and execu-
tives can exert considerable influence,
both upon groups within the Federal
Labor caucus and upon important seg-
ments of the Party.
It is in this area that Calwell is
still strong, through the network of
contacts and relationships which he has
built up during a lifetime in the Labor
movement, and Calwell has not lost his
old destructive powers. He is an old
dog who knows every move in the
game. Why should he not use his ex-
tensive repertoire against Whitlam,
whom (as an unpublished report to the
ALP Federal Executive made after the
1966 electoral defeat clearly shows) he
has not forgiven for what he believes
were attempts to undermine his leader-
ship during critical periods of Labor’s
history?
Labor’s Left Wing is prepared to use
Calwell as a spearhead and to muster
behind him, as a symbol on both the
Vietnam issue and the maintenance of
Labor’s uncompromising anti-DLP
stand. There is a strong moral aspect
in this. However violently one may dis-
agree with the Left Wing’s Vietnam
policy (which Left-wing forces im-
posed upon the Adelaide ALP confer-
ence), a number of the Left-wingers
hold to it very sincerely. They are
prepared to go down to electoral de-
feat after electoral defeat to uphold it.
The obvious ambition of some of the
Whitlam supporters to make a deal
with the DLP will also strengthen Cal-
well’s hand and intensify the support
his viewpoint will get from the Left
Wing. The Left Wing cannot afford to
allow the ALP to make a deal with the
DLP. If there is a deal, it will be on
DLP terms. One of the terms will be a
number of Left Wing heads. For the
Left Wing, this is a matter of survival.
For Whitlam the situation is fraught
with difficulties. Gifted with a very
able tongue, he could argue that it
was Holt, not he, who was distorting
ALP policy when Holt said that Labor
policy on Vietnam was basically with-
drawal of Australian troops whatever
the adverse effect upon the Australia-
United States alliance. But that will not
be a very effective argument when it
is Whitlam’s own nominal followers
who will be claiming that Whitlam is
distorting Labor’s Vietnam policy.

A smell of
burnt fingers,
and reputations
THERE IS NOTHING very
pleasant about the smell of burned
fingers at the end of a stockmarket
boom. And the stink that came from
two company inquiries was even worse.
Last week was one of the smelliest for
years. If it were not for all the money
that investors have made over the past
year as average share prices have
jumped 50 percent, last week’s collec-
tion of dreadful business news would
have frightened most small investors
right out of the stockmarket,
Hot on the heels of the suspension of
two stockbrokers for practices that were
hardly likely to improve investors’ con-
fidence in their profession, there came
last week the official investigators’
horrifying reports into the extraordinary
performances of two of Australia’s
former leading businessmen (which, by
the way, reflected none too well on the
stockbroking profession, either). And
just to round off the week, Great
Boulder turned out to 'be only a very
little rock.
Look at the dreadful playing with the
market revealed in the Cox Bros, report
by Victorian investigator Mr. B. J.
Shaw last week. In order to keep their
share prices up during the takeover
battle for Georges in 1960, Cox
directors, under the leadership of Sir
Frank Richardson and with the
approval of Sir Frank Sellick, had
bought 1.1 million shares through their
associate company, Cox Finance Cor-
poration (which Cox owned except for
a small interest by lan Potter group’s
Australian United Enterprises). Accord-
ing to Mr. Shaw this buying had been
done through (and was encouraged by)
lan Potter and Co., Australia’s lead-
ing stockbrokers.
Apparently it was considered quite
acceptable for stockbrokers to be a
party to creating a high market if this
was to help a takeover.
But the Cox Bros, affair got even
worse. For these Cox Bros, shares fell
in price, but Cox Finance Corporation
did not want to reveal it had suffered
a loss on them when it approached the
public for loan money a couple of years
later. So it sold them for the same
price it paid for them (despite a sizable
fall in market price in the meantime)
to a company called Walana Invest-
ments, run by Cox Bros, executives.
But Walana only paid a deposit of
$2OOO for the shares which cost about
$1 million, leaving only a debt owing in
the CFC balance sheet and removing
the appearance of any loss.
But if this was what the Melbourne
financial “establishment” was getting up
to, have a look down St. Kilda Road
and see what Mr. Stanley Korman was

doing. Investigator Mr. Peter Murphy,
QC, last week called the Korman pros-
pectus for the Chevron, Sydney, “false
and misleading” (there were not even
any plans in existence on which to
make any estimates of the cost of the
hotel), and outlined the “round robin”
of cheques in February, 1961, from one
Korman company to another that was
designed to benefit the Korman family
at the expense of the public companies.
Mr. Korman is now in Pentridge Jail
over another false-prospectus charge.
His group lost $4B million of the
public’s money, and Mr. Murphy clearly
thinks some of this would have been
saved if stockbrokers did not double up
as underwriters.
And then, to make it a week to be
remembered, came what could be the
end of the wildest part of the nickel
boom. It is always the little bloke who
gets his fingers burned most. As
Bernard Baruch once said: “When the
bellhops start buying, it is time to
sell.” Well, the bellhops had been buy-
ing Great Boulder and its biggest
shareholder had been selling in recent
weeks while its share price bounded
up to $13 —and then fell to $5.80.
This followed last week’s announce-
ment that none of the holes it had
drilled in its nickel areas in the last
six weeks had shown values anywhere
near the remarkable 10 percent unex-
pectedly announced from hole 22 in
mid-October. Like most of those be-
fore it, the latest holes seem to average
only about one percent nickel, which
may explain why the company decided
not to give any more progress reports
and to save up the bad news until last
Wednesday’s annual meeting. Share-
holders who bought the stock in the
meantime will no doubt be disap-
pointed that the company managed to
keep such tight security on the bad
news. They may also wish that they
had known as much about the likeli-
hood of a big new share issue (announc-
ed last week to raise $3.1 million with
the 25-cent shares being issued at the
staggering price of $4.50) as directors
■of Loloma Mining Corporation appear-
ed to when they recently sold 100,000 or
so of their holding of 800,000-odd
Great Boulder shares, or enough to pro-
vide enough cash to pay for the 140,000
or so shares they will be entitled to in
the new issue.
Three of Great Boulder’s directors
are also on the Loloma board, as is
a partner in the stockbroking firm that
is underwriting the Great Boulder issue
that gives every appearance of being
a pretty unpopular one.
There have been better weeks for the
stockmarket.

Is there a real chance
of new Labor unity?
LAST WEEK Senator Pat Kennedy
(once kingmaker of the Labor Party)
said in Victoria that the time had come
for the rift between the ALP and the
DLP to be healed. I have held the
belief for many years that a divided
Opposition must fall, and I am still of
that belief.” Senator Kennelly gave an
indication of the lengths to which he
might go in trying to restore unity when
he said that he would not stand for re-
election in 1971. “And I’m anxious
before I go to see a Labor Govern-
ment.”
For some years Senator Kennedy has
been exploring the possibilities of unity,
mostly behind the scenes. He was repri-
manded by the ALP Federal Executive
in 1965 for one of his rare public
utterances on the issue. There is
not much doubt that he will resume
is task with increased effort in the
new Senate.
The four members of the DLP who
will combine in the Senate from the
middle of next year could not provide
a better personal foundation for moves
toward Labor unity. Gair is a former
ALP Premier, McManus a former
State ALP assistant-secretary, Byrne a
former ALP Senator, and Little a
former ALP State president.
Kennelly and other ALP leaders have
convinced Mr. Whitlam that, to wki a
Federal election with the DLP vote,
severe action has to be taken against
the Victorian Labor executive. The
problem for Whitlam is firs.tly to sum-
mon up the courage to act at all, and
then to decide whether to strike at the
Victorian executive through the ALP
Federal executive or to by-pass the
Federal machinery and act with all the
political and industrial forces which he
can marshal to his side.
If he decided to make the Federal
parliamentary caucus supreme, Mr.
Whitlam could expect the support of
the caucus itself, of the Trades and
Labor Councils in Victoria, New South
Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and
possibly Western Australia; of the State
parliamentary parties in New South
Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania,
and probably Victoria and South Aus-
tralia after a short while, and of the
State Labor parties in New South
Wales, Tasmania, and probably South
Australia. In addition he could count
Senators Gair and McManus... a good foundation
Senator Kennelly ... rift healet
on the support of a majority of the-
ACTU.
He could expect strong action
against the Victorian executive to be
supported on the grounds of the Vic-
torian unity-ticket scandals (the latest
in the Electrical Trades Union), the
incompetence of the leadership in or-
ganisational and financial matters, un-
just expulsions (the latest of a young
man who happens to be secretary of
the Council for Civil Liberties), the
united action of some executive mem-
bers and Communists in the present
Melbourne Trades Hall Council dis-
pute, and the electoral incompetence
of the Victorian Labor Party.
On the other hand Mr. Whitlam can
work to get a favorable majority on
the ALP Federal executive and act
through it. At the moment the elec-
tion-losing Left has a slight majority
on the executive, but there is a pos-
sibility of changes in the delegations
from Western Australia and Queens-
land. If the balance of power swung
toward Whitlam, a responsible foreign
policy, and a determination to win par-
liamentary office, it is possible that the
Labor Senate leaders, Murphy and
Cohen (both now on the executive),.
might also swing their allegiances.
If Mr. Whitlam can get a Federal
executive which is favorable to his
causes a strong argument on his side
is that even if action by the executive
led to a new split in Victoria, and even
Queensland, the breakaway Leftists
would almost certainly be forced to
give electoral preferences to a Whit-
lam-led ALP.
There is no doubt that the leaders
of the DLP would be ready to talk
business to a Labor Party in which
Whitlam and his supporters were in
firm control. If a reasonable com-
promise could be worked out on for-


eign policy, there would be no likely
hitches over parliamentary representa-
tion or numbers readmitted to the
ALP. But, meanwhile, Mr. Arthur Cal-
well has announced that when he gets
back to Australia he is going to lead a
resistance movement against such “con-
spiracies.”
The DLP
How invincible?
THE DLP IS now at the centre of
politics in Canberra, invincibly. The
ALP would need at least three Liberal
rebels to down the Government in the
Senate and there just aren’t that many
Liberal rebels. The Government on the
other hand needs the DLP foursome
to make its way.
In terms of sheer political ability
in wheeling, dealing, and debating, the
four DLP men are a formidable team.
Take the question of the Senate Com-
mittees which Mr. Whitlam proposed
should investigate everything under the
sun. The DLP isn’t committing itself
either way on its attitude to the pro-
posal. It is leaving its options open,
so it can leave the Labor Party un-
certain and consider each proposal on
its merit.
Its relations with the Government
parties have never been so good. This
situation was typified by Mr. Holt’s
reaction to the Senate results. The
DLP men are still smarting from his
complaint that the electoral system
gave them control of the Upper House
although they couldn’t get any seats
in the Lower House. The obvious
answer to that was, of course, that there
is an opposite way of looking at the
matter.
The DLP has support in the nation
as a whole equal to that of the Coun-
try Party. Yet the fact that the Coun-
try Party has a geographically concen-
trated vote gives it about 20 seats in
the House and its arrangements with
the Liberals give it 10 seats in the
Senate. The DLP may with justice
claim the exact reverse of Mr. Holt’s
comment: namely, that it is under-
represented in the Parliament.
With Mr. Holt’s sort of attitude evid-
ently continuing to prevail in the
Liberal Party, the DLP will be taking
every opportunity to demonstrate its
potency. The Government will have to
treat it with the respect its power com-
mands. However, its power is limited
by the fact that it has done so well out
of the last election that it might not
gain any new seats from a double dis-
solution. In addition, as things stand,
it wouldn’t want to cause an election
that led to a Labor victory. But, short
of double dissolutions, it can decide
when the Senate should bare its gums,
and when it shouldn’t.
The Cabinet
Changes at the
top?
PEOPLE ARE already speculating in
Canberra about the Cabinet reshuffle
that will be announced early next year,
and some of them tip a radical re-
shuffle. Some Liberal and Country
Party men fear that only a new-look
Ministry can save the Government in
1968 unless the Labor Party falls back
into one of its states of collapse.
The existing Ministry has performed
so ineptly and been so inactive in bring-
ing forward new ideas and so bad in
projecting them that drastic rearrange-
ments have to be made. A whole slab
of ineffectual Ministers could well get
the bullet. The main nominees are Mr.
Barnes (Territories), Dr. Forbes
(Health), Mr. Howson (Air), Mr.
Hulme (PMG), Mr. Freeth (Shipping),
Mr. Fairbairn (National Development),
and Dame Annabelle Rankin (Hous-
ing). In addition, Senator Henty
(Supply) is retiring. None of these
would be any loss. And there is a useful
Hasluck... not communicating
batch of lively characters in the two
Government Parties who could very
usefully be inducted.
Two young Victorian Liberals, Mr.
Andrew Peacock and Mr. Philip Lynch,
have the brains and the obvious ability
to move straight into junior portfolios,
and from N.S.W. Senator Bob Cotton
and the Country Party’s Mr. A. Arm-
strong are very highly spoken of. Geoff-
rey Giles from S.A. would be an ob-
vious replacement for the ineffectual
Mr. ILowson.
But the developing criticism of Mr.
Holt as a Prime Minister is that he
plays it too careful, and is afraid of
having men of independent flair in his
Ministerial team. The remedy to this
tameness would be to look among the
backbench rebels in this Party—among
Jess, St. John, Wentworth, Wright, and
Turner. He needs some firebrands.
Wentworth would start the Department
of National Development running over;
St. John would transform Territories;
Wright could enliven almost anything;
and Turner and Jess are zealous re-
formers who could be used in any
number of dusty, cobwebbed depart-
ments.
Then there is the possibility of major
changes at the top. Hasluck, for all his
sheer brainpower, is simply not com-
municating with the public. The ob-
vious replacement for him in External
Affairs is Senator John Gorton, the
Government’s best man on his feet and
a foreign policy enthusiast. Army
Minister Malcolm Fraser is obviously
streets ahead of any of the others in
the lower half of the Ministry and
deserves a major portfolio, like De-
fence.
Defence
Just drifting
THERE HAS BEEN some wry
comment in Canberra at what appears
to 'be a new principle of political
behaviour in London; namely, that a
Minister who is unable to keep his
word should resign. In their dealings
with the British, especially on defence,
Australian Ministers have found
British assurances worthless. But they
are not expecting any resignations.
Most Australian Ministers now say
they expect nothing from the British
in the way of contributions to the
stability of South-East Asia. The latest
decision to abandon the plan to develop
the island of Aldabra as a staging post
in the Indian Ocean is taken as yet
another indication of the diminishing
real content of British commitments to
SEATO and Malaysian defence. With-
out Aldabra it would be difficult and
costly to fly troops to this part of the
world.
There are some people—a minority—
in the Government who, while agreeing
that Britain is not going to be of any
further help in small land actions in
South-East Asia, nevertheless think the
British might still be induced to act as
a nuclear backstop, additional to the
Americans. Britain’s three Polaris sub-
marines and nuclear-capable F-llls
are of no use in Europe and only make
sense in deterring China.
But the only hope of getting Britain
to deploy them here would be for Aus-
tralia to offer to build most of the base
facilities. So far, at least, the Australian
Government has been unwilling to do
anything of the sort. Proposals for
developing the Cock-bum Sound naval
base so that it could service British
ships have got nowhere. There is no
indication that the Australian Govern-
ment is moving to try to get the British
to base their nuclear F-llls in Darwin.
The situation just drifts.
Of course there is speculation that
the British may now cancel their F-11l


order, but at least the Polaris sub-
marines are delivered and are there
to be bargained for.
As well as not reacting to the reason-
able British view that Australia should
provide bases if it wants the benefit of
British nuclear weaponry there is also
hesitancy in coming to an arrangement
with Singapore and Malaysia to replace
the old British Defence Treaty. This
stems from two sources. One is the
difficulty in finding a formula which is
acceptable to the Indonesians. The
Government fears that any formal
treaty might upset them. The other,
and more important, is the smallness of
our armed forces.
At current Army strength, only three
battalions can be placed in action over-
seas at any one time, only about a
quarter of Britain’s commitment at the
time of Confrontation. The Australian
Government is starting to appreciate
that any meaningful continuation of its
“forward defence strategy” will, in the
absence of the British, require a far
larger Army. But it has not yet de-
cided to do anything about it.
The Capital
Disagreement on high places
CANBERRA IS A divided city:
divided between the hillmen and the
lakesiders. For a very fiercely debated
subject in the national capital is the
question of where the new Parliament
House building should really be sited.
Canberra’s founding planner, Walter
Burley Griffin, wanted it on the slope
behind the present “provisional” Par-
liament House. Official policy then
Parliament House.... hillsite, above, or
lakeside, foreground
changed to shift the site back farther
on to the peak of “Capital Hill,” an
unimposing, asymmetrical mound of
bushland, circled by a 1000-yard
diameter ring road. According to this
scheme the parliamentarians were to
peer down on the public servants and
the Canberra populace from their
humble eminence. The hillmen, en-
thusiasts for this site, would challenge
this description of it. To show its
significance they point not to its height
on the ground but its place on the
map, where it appears to be dominant.
If it was an American architect who
chose the hill, it was an Englishman,
Lord Holford, the famous London
planner, who in 1958 divided Canberra
by suggesting a new site down by
the edge of the lake. The then Prime
Minister, Mr. Menzies, quickly became
the leader of the lakesiders and the
newly formed National Capital De-
velopment Commission joined him.
Most Canberra citizens didn’t care very
much. The Government was getting
such hell for spending s6m. on the
lakes that it was unlikely to risk
bringing down on itself the additional
wrath likely to be generated by an
early start on the new Parliament.
There matters rested, while the NCDC
put discreet, dotted shapes on its future
maps to show a lakeside new Par-
liament.
About 1964 the Government sensed
a change in public attitudes toward
Canberra. Tourists began to flock in
by hundreds of thousands each year,
and those “extravagant, wasteful, ridi-
culous” lakes which Mr. Calwell had
so loudly denounced in the 1961 elec-
tion campaign became popular, with
three-quarters of a million Australians
coming through the city each year and
the vast bulk reacting favorably. This
laid the ground for moves to alleviate
the shortage of space in Parliament
by commissioning a new wing for the
existing building, and setting up a Joint
Parliamentary Committee to report on
the siting and needs of the new Par-
liament House.
The committee mucked around wait-
ing the outcome of the referendum on
the nexus before getting down to work.
It had to wait to see how many parlia-
mentarians there would be. It settled
down to work once the Budget session
was finished. Last week it toured around
Canberra in a bus looking at sites.
At the beginning, the clear split be-
tween hillmen and lakesiders was almost
on clear Party lines. The Labor fellows
followed Arthur Calwell into the hills
(with a couple of Country Party men
starting off that way, too). The Liberals
faithfully followed Menzies down to the
lake.
But after many lectures and slide-
shows, much roneoed paper and sketch
plans and peering out from the tops of
surrounding hills, the planners of the
National Capital Development Com-
mission began to wear down the opposi-
tion. Their strong point was the fact
that, to get any sort of platform on
which to place a major building, huge
earthworks would be needed at an
estimated extra cost of s4m. About
40 feet would have to be shaved off the
hill. And once that was done it would
be in an even less dominant position.
And more difficult to handle, traffic-
wise.
The lakeside site had everything ex-
cept height. It was ready prepared with
plenty of surrounding flat land for
plazas, ceremonies, and easy access.
Placed down by the edge of the lake
it would be impressively in the centre
of things, a visual climax of many
vistas, and a source of much derisive
comment from the hillmen it would
allow distinguished visitors to arrive
by water. The few remaining hillsiders
are left with the joke that Australia
will soon need a fleet of VIP launches.
Kings Cross
The Holy War
"HOLY WAR in Kings Cross” was
the enthusiastic heading on the front
page of the local newspaper. It was its
maiden edition and next to a picture
of a pretty model was a sensational
story of the intention of the Reverend
Bernard Gook to wage war on sin and
on the Reverend Ted Noffs of the Way-
side Chapel. Since 1964, Ted Noffs has
been attracting thousands of young
people to his coffee shop, theatre, and
question sessions, and local businessmen
are supporting his drug clinic to the
tune of $20,000. But people in his

Satisfy both worlds—ask for St. Agnes Brandy
Methodist Church and outside it are
saying that the Chapel is not providing
religion but is unwittingly providing
a dispensary for coffee, girls, and drugs.
The Bulletin talked to Mr. Gook and
Mr. Noffs and discovered no declara-
tion of war, but instead two reform-
ing ministers working for and against
another full-scale Reformation.
Mr. Gook, who became minister of
St. John’s Church of England, Darling-
hurst, two months ago, feels that their
clash is doctrinal and that “Ted Noffs’
problem is his eagerness for numbers.
He doesn’t wish to make people feel
guilty regarding the teaching of the
Bible and the implications of Christ’s
death. He has changed. Five years ago
in his teenage cabaret days I heard him
preaching a most fundamental message
from Scriptures of Christ. Now he is
virtually pushing God out the window
and denouncing fellow-Methodists for
not dealing with people. He is so con-
cerned with people, he has no room for
what God said.
“Here I have formed ‘Johnny’s Club’.
For the older people who are in trouble
we have discussion groups. People are
coming along of their own accord
prostitutes, drug addicts, guys in
trouble with the police. Most have been
to Ted Noffs’ coffee house and have
not been spoken to on spiritual mat-
ters.”
At the Wayside Chapel the little
theatre is of a very modern design,
the paintings in the coffee bar would
be found in experimental art galleries,
and Ted Noffs works in a suit and tie.
“We haven’t just plucked a few ideas out
of the air and then gone and compro-
mised ourselves. We believe this ex-
periment is vital for our survival. What
Gook has said about me, what is said
about all the experimenters today, was
said about Christ—‘He is leading the
people astray.’ We are fighting against
the whole of traditional Christianity.
The Wayside Chapel is trying to earn
back the right and the privilege of the
young people’s attention. What other
church group has an open question
period every Sunday, where youth in re-
volt ask us to justify Jesus, guilt, where
I park my car, and what I enjoy most?
“I have changed. I have had the
privilege of growing up since the days
of my teenage cabarets. I no longer
believe in guilt—the psychiatric hos-
pitals are full of the results of that.
In the last analysis, it is the results
that count. We deal with about 5000
young people here. The Wayside Chapel
is concerned with society at large, with
the young people who will shape the
21st century!”
Both these ministers believe that it is
among the young and the social outcasts
that the battle must be fought. It re-
mains to be seen whether the young
accept Bernard Gook’s traditional style
or Ted Noffs’ Reformation. Or reject
both.

New Guinea goes
to the polls
ELECTORAL OFFICERS FOUND
six tattooed and heavily bearded natives
on their doorstep at the highlands
town of Mount Hagen this week —
patiently waiting to nominate for
Papua-New. Guinea’s second general
election. The tribesmen, who had
camped overnight on the doorstep to
lodge their nominations, typified the
determination of many New Guinea
tribesmen to take part in the govern-
ment of their “emerging country.”
There has been a rash of newly
formed political parties in recent
months. The score now stands at six
but there could be more to come.
Coffee plantation owners in the New
Guinea highlands, crocodile shooters in
the Papuan river swamps, missionaries,
truck drivers, trade storekeepers, tribal
fight leaders, and public servants all
Voters at the 1964 elections studying
candidates’ pictures
want to stand for election. Chief
Electoral Officer, Mr. Bob Bryant,
expects up to 700 candidates, 400 more
than in the first elections in 1964.
Villagers—many of whom had never
seen a white man —approached those-
first elections with fear and suspicion.
A short time after polling had been
carried out near Kainantu, in the New
Guinea highlands, a handful of villagers
died from an Asian flu epidemic. Many
people 'blamed the elections and the
bright red polling box was dubbed
“blood box.” To combat the sorcery
of the blood box, neighboring villagers
purified the area leading to the polling
booths with dried leaves and flowers.
In other areas people feared the
elections meant they were going to be
taxed or the white man was about to
desert them. Some Papuans packed
their belongings and prepared to flee.

The blood-red. boxes were designed to prevent ballot stuffing
Bob Bryant expects things to be vastly
different this time. “In 1964 we had
only nine months to prepare people for
elections. When voting begins in
February we will have had four years,”
he says. “Everyone voting will have
had experience of local-government
council elections which are really
miniatures of the House of Assembly
polling.”
More than one million people were
eligible to vote last time. Of these 72
percent went to the polls. Bryant
hopes for a similar turnout in February.
He says that in the towns wet weather
could have an adverse effect on voting,
but “in the villages it doesn’t matter
what the weather does. When the
polling box comes to the village it’s a
festive day. Some of them have col-
lected their polling booths beforehand
and decorated them with bunches of
flowers. Each person solemnly casts
his vote and at night they hold a sing-
sing.”
Bryant is confident that voters will
not be misled by candidates who make
extravagant promises—“this is a
common condition of politicians every-
where.” Last election a New Britain
man promised to turn everybody’s skin
white if he was elected. He was not.
Campaigning in the Territory is an
arduous affair. Candidates have to
do a lot of their stomping on foot.
Queensland-born plantation owner Tom
Leahy has been swinging around New
Guinea’s fertile Markham Valley for
the past year making himself known
to isolated villages in his electorate.
Many of them are a three-day walk
away. Other hopeful candidates are
campaigning in light aircraft, canoes,
and four-wheel-drive trucks through
rain forest, precipitous mountain
country, jungle swamps, and savannah
grassland.
More than 2000 Government officers
and volunteers will face the same hard-
ships when they start taking the col-
lapsible polling booths into remote
areas from February 17 to March 16
next year. Town voting will be done
on the first day, and for the next four
weeks the electoral officers will travel
by helicopter, boat, and on foot to
outlying electorates.
As votes come in, the polling boxes
are held under “maximum security,”
Bryant said. “Voting trends should
become apparent by midnight of the
last polling day.”
Bryant said there was a surprisingly
low informal vote at the 1964 elec-
tions. The voting system is “modified
preferential”; a number one against
any candidate’s name is counted as a
formal vote despite the fact that the
voter has not marked his preference.
Voting will be for 69 open electorates
in which any Papuan or New Guinean
or any Australian who has been resi-
dent in the Territory for five years, is
eligible, and 15 regional seats, for which
the equivalent of a Territory Inter-
mediate Certificate is needed. At the
last House there were 44 open and
ten special electorates (restricted to
Europeans).
Campaign platforms, in rural areas
at least, are expected to centre on
parochial issues—bridges, hospital aid
posts, and schools. In the towns higher
wages and better housing conditions for
indigenous public servants will form
the platforms of most political parties
and many independent candidates.
The 10,000-strong Public Service
Association, disappointed at its failure
to force a review of last May’s contro-
versial judgment on pay scales for
indigenous public servants, has
announced it is considering asking all
election candidates to state publicly
their opposition to or support for its
efforts to gain higher wages for its
Papuan and New Guinean members.
Many of the expected 700 candi-
dates may be motivated by such things
as a desire to help their countrymen,
social prestige or aspirations to power.
But the annual MHA’s salary of 2500
dollars—-more than six times the average
Papuan or New Guinean’s pay—is
certain to have its attractions.


Running Australia by the seat of our pants
The unrole of economists in government
WHEN Mr. Gough Whitlam criticised
the Government for its slowness in
handling the question of whether Aus-
tralia should follow Britain in devalua-
tion he had half a point. His suggestion
that the Government should have had a
contingency plan ready to be rolled
into action immediately was stupid. No
such plan could have been made, since
it is not possible to know beforehand
such crucial things as the extent of the
devaluation or the number of countries
which are likely to devalue also. In
addition, it is unrealistic to think that
crucial urban-rural (Liberal-Country
Party) clashes of interest can actually
be resolved until they have to be. No
politician in his right mind looks for a
fight until he is forced into the ring by
events.
But he did have half a point. For the
facts are that when it came to the
crunch a fortnight ago, and the news of
the devaluation came through, the Gov-
ernment and its advisers had to start
from scratch. No one in the whole of
"When the news of devaluation
came through, the Government
and its advisers had to start
from scratch"
Canberra had in readily available form
such essential information as the im-
portance of Britain in the total market
for each of our various exporting in-
dustries, or the terms in which our
different trade agreements and con-
tracts are written. One poor public
servant was almost driven mad trying
to find out whether our sale contracts
for hundreds of millions of dollars of
wheat with China were specified in
dollars or sterling, an issue on which
about s3om. hung. No one in Canberra
knew and the Wheat Board members
couldn’t be found over the weekend.
In addition there were simply no back-
ground papers available on such im-
portant related issues as the likely phas-
ing of Britain’s entry into the Common
Market, provisions (if any) which
Britain might make for our exports of
butter and dried fruits, or the possi-
bilities for finding markets elsewhere.
If it was impossible to have some
fully worked-out plan to cover the
contingency of devaluation, it should
have been possible to have basic in-
formation available and background
papers'ready, so that departmental sub-
missions could be solidly based in facts
and arguments and rapidly compiled.
As it was, the submissions presented to
Cabinet were pretty shoddy. Treasury’s
was quite general, not containing much
detailed information. But it won
through against the Trade Depart-
ment’s, which evidently was a complete
mess bits and pieces of hurriedly
assembled statistics, sweeping assertions,
and confused recommendations.
“If ours was not much good, at least
it wasn’t a joke like Trade’s,” was
the way a Treasury man described the
departmental submissions to Cabinet
the day it had to make the devaluation
decision. The decision, right though
everyone agrees it to have been, was
taken on the sketchiest of official
advice.
This, in my impression, is the rule
rather than the exception, even in cases
where there is plenty of time available.
The decision on going ahead on the
second stage of the Ord River scheme
was broken to the Northern Division of
the Department of National Develop-
ment by one of the Canberra men of
the “Financial Review” who had just
got the Prime Ministerial Press release.
The Bureau of Agricultural Economics
did not even know it was up for con-
sideration by Cabinet. And at the time
of the announcement of Commonwealth
money for the Emerald irrigation
scheme, a team of soil analysts was just
preparing to visit the area to examine
its technical feasibility. There was no
economic survey, apart from one five
years ago, which reported quite cate-
gorically that the scheme could not
possibly pay for itself.
This seat-of-the-pants approach to
highly complex economic decisions, in-
volving huge amounts of taxpayers’
money and large chunks of the nation’s
resources, is quite typical of our present
Government in Canberra. And it is not
the sort of thing that is likely to be
changed very quickly. Too much of it
is built into the system.
We could perhaps conceive the possi-
bility of an idealised model of Gough
Whitlam or Leslie Bury coming to
power and wanting to make sweeping
changes so that economic policy deci-
sions were more soundly based. He
would be tempted to do what Harold
Wilson and George Brown did when
they found themselves landed with the
sort of archaic system we still have
bypass it, set up a new department, and
build from scratch your planning, co-
ordination, and productivity-boosting
secretariats. And when you find else-
where that your departmental advisers
are idea-less old fogies, the bypass
philosophy tells you to hire from a
university or a newspaper a “special
expert personal consultant.”
Britain’s recent economic history
suggests that this sort of “radical im-
provisation,” to coin a phrase for their
bypass approach, has been an almost
unmitigated disaster. The grandiose but
empty National Plan, the Selective
Employment Tax, the continual delay
in devaluing, in fact almost all the
policies of the additional departments
and the special expert consultants have
proved failures. The only effective
means of modernising the economic
decision-making process would appear
to be to slog away at the existing sys-
tem rather than to hang new parts on
to it.
Any modernisation must start with a
recognition of the value of professional
economic training for the instinctive
feeling it develops about such things
as comparative costs, laws of supply
and demand, marginality, and for the
technical ability to assess statistics and
judge the use of jargon which profes-
sional training in economics should im-
part. At present many government
agencies charged with the task of assess-
ing complex economic data and making
decisions with far-reaching economic
implications are largely run and staffed
by economic illiterates.
Only the Departments of Primary
Industry (in its subsidiary Bureau of
Agricultural Economics) and the
Treasury have professional economists
in their key policy-forming sections.
National Development, the Bureau of
Mineral Resources, Trade and Industry,
and Defence, to name the other de-
partments that are very much con-
cerned in forming economic policy, are
almost devoid of people with serious
economics training (if by that we
"At present many government

By PETER SAMUEL
mean people who have something more
than a bachelor’s pass degree or who
have done postgraduate economic re-
search.)
Semi-independent agencies on the
periphery of the Government are in an
equally bad position. Of the eight mem-
bers of the Tariff Board only one is
a professional economist, of the five
currently sitting on the Arbitration
Commission—none. The ad hoc Com-
mittee of Economic Enquiry was
manned by four amateurs and only
one professional. All these bodies have
been primarily concerned with econ-
omic issues, and they have been re-
quired to do detailed and difficult
economic research and evaluation. Yet
they have been run in the main by
people with only the merest smattering
of economic knowledge.
They have traditionally been re-
garded, and are still, as bodies that
should mirror various interest groups in
the community; therefore they are com-
posed of a mishmash of notables from
the prominent lobby groups. If an
economist slipped in (as at the Tariff
Board) he appears to have been put
there more for his lobby-group associa-
tions than for his professional qualifica-
tions. And of course traditional practice
has it that if the representatives of
lobby groups are to be avoided, the
appropriate professional types to
employ are those revered jacks of all
trades, the lawyers. Hence our strange
wage-fixing institutions.
The manning of these economic
policy-making agencies by this odd
assortment of amateurs is partly a tra-
ditional political response, partly an
application of the Australian cult of the
fair-go which values consensus and an
abstract sense of justice more highly
than consistency and the systematic
pursuit of more tangible objectives. But
its effect is clear. Important decisions
are being made in key areas of econ-
omic policy in tariffs, the develop-
ment of secondary industry, exports,
wages and salaries, minerals, fuels —
by people incapable of assessing or even
understanding the choices they face or
the implications of what they decide.
Thus the Department of Trade and
Industry, from 1963 onward, at great
cost to the motor industry, began to
impose a complex quota scheme for the
Australianisation of production and
assembly, but because of its economic
unrealism this policy has had to have
been undone in bits and pieces ever
since; the Arbitration Commission, be-
cause of past embarrassment with its
naive explanations of the economic
basis of its decisions, has simply given
up trying to explain what it decides; a
set of floor prices for iron-ore sales
overseas loses us valuable contracts and
then has to be quietly scrapped: to
name just a few of the many recent
failures in economic policymaking
attributable to inadequate technical
economic advice.
There is a sort of viciously circular
effect involved. A lack of respect at the
top in these agencies and departments
for professional economic rigor and a
failure to recognise the value of tech-
nical economic proficiency deters econ-
"The Defence section of the
Treasury is incapable of advis-
ing the Government on how to
move toward a benefit-cost ap-
proach of the McNamara sort."
omists from joining or staying in the
government service. To be concrete,
when it is generally and seriously
accepted in the Department of Trade
that the function of economic statistics
is to provide a sort of public relations
dress-up of predetermined policy and
that “research” is the word for patch-
ing together a substantiation of a case
rather than exploring or testing it, then
it will not get or hold economists of
ability or integrity.
Even the more professionally com-
petent areas of government are severely
underequipped with economists. The
Treasury Department, with more pro-
fessionals than the rest of the Public
Service put together, is very weak in
some places. Its Defence section is
simply incapable of advising the Gov-
ernment on how to move toward a
benefit-cost approach of the McNamara
sort in the purchase of weapons
systems, a failure which must be costing
the nation a good $lOO million a year
and severely blunting our overall
defence effort. The Commerce and
Industry Branch, which could conceiv-
ably be an influence for rationality in
tariff and industrial development
matters, and an offset to the Depart-
ment of Trade’s wild adventures,
appears quite quiescent because it
is short of staff. Even the elite Financial
and Economic Policy branch, which is
concerned with a broad range of ad-
visory functions on the budget,
balance of payments, short-term fore-
casting, taxation, Commonwealth-State
financial relations, and special research
projects is badly understaffed. Only
about two-thirds of its 60 established
positions are filled, and the establish-
ment itself is only held down at this
modest level because of the great diffi-
culties it has in recruitment. More is
perhaps at stake in this branch than
almost any other part of the Public
Service, a point illustrated by its failure
in 1960 and afterwards. It must bear
heavy responsibility for the mistaken
credit squeeze of November that year,
and for the completely unnecessary
recession, which extended through 1961
to 1963 and which cost the economy
production losses of the order of $lOOO
million. The Bureau of Census and
Statistics, whose performance in pro-
viding basic data is crucial to most
economic policy work in government,
suffers also from dire staff shortages,
one of the main reasons why a wide
range of statistics produced in most
advanced countries of the world is not
available here.
The fact that there are staff shortages
even in the areas of government where
economists’ technical abilities are
appreciated points to other failings.
One is the extraordinarily gross canni-
balistic appetite of the economics de-


partments in the universities. Their
ability to consume their own product
has been a remarkable phenomenon in
the past decade. It is hard to get exact
figures, but they look something like
this: Through the ’sos the universities
produced a static 30 or so honors
economics graduates each year. From
1959 there was a great spurt and today
well over 100 are graduating each
year. But only a small proportion of
these get back out of the universities.
Most seem to be devoured by the uni-
versity system, going back into teaching,
or on to a research project for a higher
degree. Only a tiny trickle appear to
find their way into the Government.
The Bureau of Census and Statistics
has done relatively well in its recruit-
ing, finding about half a dozen a year
in the past two or three years at least.
The Grants Commission and the Uni-
versities Commission have got several.
But the “anti-economic” departments
like Trade (which also scandalously
controls the staffing of the Tariff
Board), National Development, and
Defence have got virtually none. And
Treasury has done very badly. Its heavy
responsibilities mean that more than
any other department it needs the best
the universities can provide. Yet in the
past ten years it has managed to recruit
only one first-class honors economics
graduate direct from a university, and
only three others indirectly. When it
should be recruiting ten or 15 young
economists each year, it is in fact get-
ting an average of about three. Not for
lack of trying, either; a senior Treasury
officer takes about three weeks off each
year to do a recruiting tour of the
universities.
For most economists life within the
monastery of the university appears
more attractive. On top of the infor-
mality of university work, its long
vacations, flexible hours, and lack of
being bossed about, salaries are at least
as good in universities as in govern-
ment, or better. For purposes of com-
parison, a full professor is on average
of about the same intellectual capacity
and experience in a university as an
assistant-secretary in the Public Service.
The professor gets $12,000 a year and
the assistant-secretary $10,500. In
America, economists in teaching jobs
get on average only two-thirds of those
in business and government. This is
why a larger proportion of them are
disgorged from the educational system.
What is to be done?
If Australian government is to get
the economists it needs, then it appears
obvious that it will have to raise their
salaries considerably and place closer
restraints on the expansion of univer-
sity economics departments. The uni-
versities have just about quadrupled
their output of pass degree students
since the end of the 19505, but the value
to the community of this - given the
content of present courses is doubt-
ful. Certainly a large number of people
with a smattering of economics, statis-
tics, history, geography, and accoun-
tancy must be filtering into schools,
business firms, and government depart-
ments, but their university training is
so generalised and sketchy that it is
unlikely to be of much direct benefit.
The Government itself needs to
recognise economists more clearly as
professional people if it wants them.
At present under general Public Service
rules an economist is accepted with the
prestigious and morale-boosting title
of “Clerk, Base Grade,” though in fact
the few who do enter can usually easily
get a Research Officer position several
rungs up the Third Division from
there. Whereas most professional
groups are recognised and their salaries
and positions independently assessed,
economists are lumped in with the
great non-specialist mass of adminis-
trative and clerical officers. Certain
areas of the Public Service have, in an
informal and rather indefinite way,
established their own rules about the
need to insist on professional economic
qualifications. This is true of the FEP
branch of Treasury, the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, and, to a lesser
extent, small economics sections in the
PMG Department, Territories, and
"ln the past ten years the
Treasury has managed to recruit
only one first-class honors
graduate direct from a
university."
National Development. Trade and
Shipping and Transport have appended
one or two people called “Economic
Adviser.” But as a Treasury person
says: “The Public Service Board
wouldn’t object if we were entirely
staffed with classicists.”
Economists themselves are partly to
blame for this situation. In Australia
most professional groups have them-
selves taken the initiative to gain pro-
fessional recognition by forming a pro-
fessional association and advancing in-
dustrial claims. But in Australia there
is no professional economists’ associa-
tion, and no body to set standards and
engage in representing economists to
the public or in industrial tribunals.
The quality of government economic
decisions is influenced not only by the
people in government but by the level
of research and public debate outside;
to this debate university economists can
be expected to contribute heavily. But,
with a few notable exceptions, they
have in fact contributed remarkably
little. Academic comment on the state
of the economy and the quality of the
Government’s management has been
generally poor and amateurish.
Only Dr. Alan Hall, of the ANU,
has made a consistent effort. Only Pro-
fessor Burgess Cameron has done
research work on the behavioural char-
acteristics of quarter-by-quarter changes
in the economy. Professor Alex Hunter
has contributed a great deal to getting
the restrictive practices legislation
through and done useful papers on con-
troversial public issues such as the
proposal for an Australian international
shipping line, natural gas and oil search
policies, and so on. Only one university
economist, Dr. Brash, has done any-
thing of value on the question of Ameri-
can investment in Australian business.
A number Isaac, Karmel, and Han-
cock have contributed to the dis-
cussion of wages policy. Apart from
Dr. Corden, none have done anything-
of value on tariff or industrial develop-
ment policy. The reserve price scheme
for wool was the subject of useful study
by economists from the University of
New England, and the whole question
of an approach to northern develop-
ment has been tackled by only two or
three.
A small band of newspaper econ-
omics and financial writers have prob-
ably contributed as much in the past
five or six years as the 200 university
economists to the public debate on
economic issues.
Two academic journals one quar-
terly, the other irregularly six-monthly
containing in a year perhaps 300, 000
words of economics are published in
Australia. This represents an increase
of some 375 percent on the 80,000 or
so words written in the 19505. The
number of books is also up, but a large
number of them are simply income-
increasing collections of already-
published articles. There is no evidence
of any increase in university economists’
productivity! Both Canberra and Mel-
bourne now have full-time research de-
partments whose work has, on the
whole, been disappointing in both
quantity and quality.
Only a small proportion of research
work is of any direct relevance to
public policy. A comment by Professor
S. Butlin, of Sydney University, on his
colleagues’ work in the principal
academic journal is worth quoting:
“There has been a marked turning-
away from the big subjects of the pre-
war period to the pursuit of small
specialisms. That would be just as
laudable as it is inevitable if it were
not for the manner in which the
specialisms are too often cultivated.
Rarely, one feels, is the small topic
seen in the large context, and even
more rarely is the initial skirmishing
followed up to achieve thorough treat-
ment. There is, in short, a good deal
of dilettantism, in which the contributor
seems more interested in exhibiting his
virtuosity in technique than in solving a
real problem . . . work in both mathe-
matical and econometric (statistical)
fields is lagging behind overseas and
that is a basic criticism of our univer-
sity economics . . . There is, in short,
an air of decadence about much Aus-
tralian economics.”

How to speculate
JUST AFTER THE EIGHTH ARMY
had captured Florence, I was invited
to the Swiss Consulate for lunch, where
I asked the Consul how they had man-
aged in the beleaguered city. The Con-
sul seemed to have been doing pretty
well. It was an excellent lunch. “Ah,”
he said, “not too badly, the Germans
treated us pretty well and, after all,
somebody has to be neutral.” Neutral,
indeed the kind of neutrality that
means that, although devaluations come
and go, the Gnomes of Zurich go on
forever. Nobody ever heard of the Swiss
franc being devalued. One might
imagine that the neutrality was always
benevolent, that the bears of Zurich
were not in at the kill to take theii
pickings, as they certainly were follow-
ing the recent devaluation of the pound,
in which their speculative activities
were as powerful as force as any.
But even currency speculators do not
determine devaluations. They simply
hurry them on. The basic engineering
is donb mostly by the countries which
have to devalue themselves.
And sometimes they can get their own
back. When the revaluation of the Aust-
ralian pound was mooted in 1950, hot
money flowed here to take advantage
of it from all over the world, especially
from Britain and the United States.
Behind that hot money were the specu-
lators. They got their fingers badly
burned, because the Korean commodity
price boom burst and the case for the
revaluation of the pound went into
thin air. The truth is that, although
currency speculators have an intimate
sensitivity which attracts them to sick
economies so that they can deploy their
forces against them in the foreign
exchange markets, they do not neces-
sarily govern events. Having made their
The Wales dealing room, London
dispositions, as they did against sterling
three years ago, they have to sit back
and wait, even renew their credits, until
they see what happens to the currency
they’ve attacked. The final pushover of
a currency is more likely to be done
by people operating in normal trading
channels than by any last raids from
the speculators.
Governments can be most obstinate in
defence of their currencies from the
speculators, and where they are rein-
forced, as in the case of New Zealand,
by import and exchange controls, this
means that the currency speculators have
little say in the matter either way,
except insofar as they can subvert the
controls and drive a country further
into a strait jacket, where, in the end,
the only way out, as it proved in the
case of New Zealand, is to accept the
inevitable and devalue. In that case
devaluation can be a blessing in dis-
guise, as undoubtedly it will prove to be
for New Zealand.
But speculators have everything to
play for in countries whose external
financial frontiers are not shored up
by massive controls, as in the case of
the two great reserve currencies in
the world, the U.S. dollar and sterling
at least at the beginning when they
detect a weakness which will, in their
view, inevitably lead to the exchange
adjustment they are looking for. But
they still have to be patient and await
events to see if the smaller fry provide
the final push.
A fellow I know is still walking on
the carpet he bought from the profit
he made buying gold shares shortly
before the 1949 devaluation of sterling.
Six weeks ago the same man, sensing
another devaluation of the pound was
in the offing, transferred the balance
in his account at a London bank into
Australian dollars. In the past week he
has sent the money back to London,
thus notching himself a nice profit of
14.3 percent. This chap would not be
all that shocked to be called a currency
speculator. That, in fact, is what his
currency manoeuvres tab him, at least
in one sense. But his moves can just as
correctly be deemed prudent business-
like precautions, in this case inspired,
because he was actually taking a punt
on the possibility that for the first time
the Australian monetary authorities
would not slavishly devalue our cur-
rency along with the pound. As it hap-
pened, it paid off just as well for him
to switch into our dollars as into U.S.
dollars or Swiss francs, the proverbially
“hard” currencies. Of course, if he had
switched into New Zealand dollars he
would have lost money, in that New
Zealand devalued to an even greater
extent than Britain, but then that was
a move standing out a mile to any cur-
rency speculator worth his salt over the
past year or so (especially one who has
been following the arguments for it in
The Bulletin).
Multiplied thousands of times, some
on a far bigger scale than my friend’s,
by people around the world owning
sterling balances who had the same
suspicions about the course of the
pound, such transfers out of sterling put
irresistible pressures on the pound,
especially after the die of devaluation
had been cast by Prime Minister Wil-
son’s Mansion House dinner speech and
the immediate conclusions drawn from
it by the London “Times.” The point
about these last nails in sterling’s coffin
is that they were driven not necessarily
by any personal or even objective view
of the survival powers of the British
economy, but rather by the considera-
tion that despite repeated official
denials that devaluation was imminent,
in its role as a world reserve currency
the pound was insupportable at its
pegged level of $U.5.2.80. They cer-
tainly pushed sterling over the brink,
but these actions were only the last in
a long line of currency speculations
and cautionary moves which have been
working to the discomfort of sterling
for a number of years and with added
force since the Wilson Government
assumed office in October, 1964.
In a word, a currency, especially a
reserve currency such as the pound or
the U.S. dollar (which between them
share most of the financing of world
trade), can be driven to the wall by an
excess supply of it being offered in
foreign exchange markets in exchange
for other currencies. But that is only
part of the process. When the outlook
for a currency is worsening, pressures
on it will be built up just as forcibly
when people, who would normally be
buying it in the ordinary course of
events, shy off it in favor of alternative
currencies. They can buy these just as
readily and, even if at some inconveni-
ence, they can hold them until they
find out what is going to happen to
sterling or whatever other currency (at
the moment, the U.S. dollar) is under
fire.
In such decisions to hold off sterling
you can’t draw' a sharp line between
speculation and normal hedging. The
nearer you get to the decision to
devalue, the line becomes more blurred.
This is why, among the reasons which
finally bring a currency to grief, the
acceleration of hedging in the legitimate
course of business is likely to be as
decisive as deliberate speculation.
Australian businessmen know as much


By J. C. HORSFALL
about this aspect of international trade
and capital movements as any others.
Since the devaluation of sterling, several
Australian companies—CSß and Henry
Jones, for instance —have stressed their
pre-devaluation hedging operations in
explaining why they would not be as
hardly hit by the devaluation in their
trading operations with Britain as might
have been expected by simply going on
their substantial sales in Britain and in
other devaluing countries. It is pretty
obvious that if hedging was undertaken
on a big scale by concerns domiciled in
sterling-area countries purporting to be
playing the game according to the un-
written club rules, then the hedging
elsewhere must have been very consid-
erable indeed in the weeks prior to
devaluation. Just how much of it there
was will never be known. All we know
is that sterling is used to finance more
than half the world’s trade and is one
of the most widely used media for
capital transactions, Australia’s as much
as anybody’s.
Apart from calculating hedging opera-
tions, say on the forward foreign ex-
change markets, defensive action is
widely taken against the possibility of
devaluation by postponement of pay-
ments in sterling. With sterling under
suspicion, obviously countries with big
sterling commitments to meet would try
to hold off the purchase of the neces-
sary sterling as long as they could, thus
denying sterling some of the support it
would normally get. On the trade side,
such commitments are not only for pay-
ments for British exports but also for
the financing of trade between many
countries who habitually use sterling as
the main currency for buying or selling
each other’s goods. For instance, Japan
might decide to buy from Indonesia in
sterling. But if Japanese importers
thought sterling was under threat of
devaluation they would not be in any
hurry to acquire sterling to make pay-
ments for imports. In the same way,
many countries with obligations in sterl-
ing to meet prior to devaluation, but
feeling that devaluation was at hand,
would try to borrow sterling for the
purpose rather than purchase sterling
in the foreign exchange markets. The
sense of this, of course, is that (unless
they have devalued, too) they can pur-
chase sterling, once it is devalued, so
much cheaper in terms of their own
currency and repay the bank loans so
much more cheaply than the cost of
the original borrowing.
Borrowing of sterling in Britain for
foreign exchange transactions, particu-
larly by Continental operators, when
the Wilson Government came into power
in October, 1964, was particularly heavy
and from it originated a substantial
part of the bear position in sterling
which has been a root cause of sterling’s
troubles, with only minor breaks, ever
since. The essence of a lot of this posi-
tion is that the borrowings of sterling
have had to be renewed from time to
time by the bears, but when they finally
close (as a lot of them have done since
devaluation), they are in a position to
repay the loans out of the sterling they
have repurchased at its devalued level,,
so making a substantial profit.
One of the difficulties in stopping
this sort of thing has been the enor-
mous sums of sterling in the hands
of non-British residents. For instance,
vast amounts of sterling are held by
various foreign countries, such as the
oil sheikdoms. This money is forever in
search of higher rewards and is
switched about from time to time be-
tween the international monetary cen-
tres according to the view its owners
take of the security of particular cur-

Leslie O’Brien (left), and Switzerland’s

How Australia hedges
AUSTRALIANS WERE pretty big
“hedgers” against the 14.3 percent
British devaluation. The Reserve
Bank of Australia, which insures
exporters and importers against ex-
change risks in sterling, will lose
a'bout $4O million on the insurance
cover it had given. Many of the
exporters and importers who took
out this insurance do so in all their
foreign exchange transactions as a
matter of course, hut the Reserve
Bank says that the volume of busi-
ness it did in the months before de-
valuation had been much higher
than usual.
The insurance works this way: an
exporter or importer goes to his
bank and for a payment of 10 cents
in Australian currency for every
£lOO sterling can insure against a
change to his disadvantage in the
value of sterling. The bank then
reports this to the Reserve Bank,
which actually carries the insurance;
the public does not deal direct with
the Reserve Bank. The Reserve
Bank’s $4O million loss would be
offset to some extent by the insur-
ance premiums it had received for
the past 18 years since the previous
devaluation.
Protection against exchange fluc-
tuations in the U.S. dollar is
achieved a different way, with banks
protecting their Australian clients
only through operations on the
London market in forward dollars,
so that there is no fixed “under-
writing fee.” In fact, the Reserve
Bank handles this business for the
banks in the main and, where it
cannot offset risks in its own books,
it deals in the foreign exchange
market so that it is not acting as
the insurer itself, ibut simply as the
agent arranging “cover.”
One of the easiest methods of
gambling against an exchange rate
move is to buy or sell “futures” in a
world commodity market in the
expectation that the commodity price
will move to offset the currency
change.
Government policy has prevented
Australian marketing boards from
insuring through the Reserve Bank
against exchange risks because it
may look like official endorsement
of the existence of risk in a foreign
currency, and as a result the Aus-
tralian Wheat Board lost $3O million
on sterling’s devaluation. Yet
other commodities which are lucky
enough to be marketed by private
agencies on behalf of the Govern-
ment (like sugar, which is handled
by Colonial Sugar Refining) are not
subject to this restraint and so did
not suffer loss.

rencies. It provides good supplies of
fodder for currency speculators, as well
as creating uncertainties for any cur-
rency it happens to be taking a jaun-
diced view of at any particular time.
The key to Britain’s fight to save
the pound lay with the owners of this
money and the bears (uncovered sell-
ers) of sterling. Unfortunately, they
were not convinced, or ever looked
likely to be convinced that sterling was
a good bet under its present Govern-
ment or with its chronically dicky
balance of payments. Apparently not
even a seven percent Bank Rate could
swing the mover. It is now eight per-
cent, of course, but that is a different
matter the deed has been done, the
horse bolted. So, despite devaluation,
every effort must still be made to get
the bears to cover and bolster confi-
dence in the currency at its lower level.
If the Gnomes of Zurich and their
fellow currency conspirators in other
European capitals have been for-
saking sterling these past three years,
the central banks in these countries
were at least counteracting their
switches by lending Britain substantial
short-term funds with which to help
provide the foreign currencies required
by those switching out of sterling. The
renewal of these central bank credits
was successfully arranged by Britain
over practically the whole of the Wil-
son Government’s regime, but in recent
weeks some doubt was cast, particularly
by France, about the wisdom of renew-
ing the credits once again. This was
where France really came in. Given
such doubts, another run on sterling
was inevitable. This proved the last
straw. The Bank of England has virtu-
ally run out of gold and foreign cur-
rencies. It couldn’t buy the crisis off.

INDONESIA Another bloodbath?
“FOR EVERY COMMUNIST
KILLED, a thousand will arise.” So a
young man of about 30 assures me in
the shabby hall of Banjuwangi railway
station. Around us are soldiers, poor
barefoot peasants, and small children
selling skewered cockroaches. The
features like a Javanese god’s of
this PKI activist become expressive as
he recalls those tragic nights when,
from his hiding-place, he saw the heads
of his comrades displayed along the
walls by their “executioner” in order
to prove to the population that the
Communists had lost. Over 6000 Com-
munists thus found death in this little
town at the most easterly point of
Java. And then, accentuating a smile
already characteristic of the Javanese
art of etok-etok the art of hiding
one’s thoughts he continues: “The
New Order? What is new about this
place? Nothing has changed. The Com-
munists will return.”
For some months the Indonesian
Government has drawn attention to the
activities of a fifth column in East
Java. The partisans of the Old Order
namely the PNI nationalists are
said to be preparing in secret for the
return of Sukarno, with the support
of certain elements in the armed forces
and of the clandestine Communist
organisations. A concealed drama is
being played out in this splendid region
where the ships still have the air of
Javanese pirate vessels and high vol-
canoes overlook paddy fields or planta-
tions of coffee, tobacco, sweet-potatoes,
or bananas. Everywhere one senses the
same feeling of disappointment mingled
with the vivid memory perhaps a
sort of remorse of the massacre of
1965. The elimination of the PKI has
done little to solve the problems posed
by the structure of society and the
dissatisfaction it engenders in a region
overpopulated, underdeveloped, and
afflicted over many years by a social
and moral crisis.

of the KAMI, the militant front of the
Indonesian students, in Surabaya, the
capital of East Java and a city of over
a million inhabitants. Muslim and
fiercely anti-Communist, he joined in
the massacre of Communists and
fellow-travellers that ravaged East Java
from October, 1965, to January, 1966,
claiming between 100,000 and 200,000
victims out of a population of 17 mil-
lion. No village was spared and some-
times whole families were annilmated.
According to many, the massacre
resulted from a spontaneous, irresistible,
and regrettable movement of the
Muslims of East Java, who had long
been exasperated by the PKl’s aggres-
sive tactics. However, from all the
accounts I was able to gather, the con-
siderable influence gained by the PKI
in East Java and its violent abolition
are to be explained in terms of the old
social structures which persisted after
independence, and of the resulting ten-
sions.
The PKl’s success in East Java at
the 1957 election the Party gained
nearly 30 percent of the votes and its
influence was increasing was due in
part to the persistence of “semi-feudal”
structures in the region. There are no
very large private estates but many
medium-sized ones generally belonging
to the Hadjis those who have made
the pilgrimage to Mecca. The mosques
themselves own wide stretches of land
which they employ as they wish. More-
over, certain large plantations have
been generally entrusted for very
substantial bribes to a few privileged
persons who do not always work them
to the best advantage.
The Agrarian Reform of 1960 re-
mained a dead letter. The authorities
entrusted with its enforcement too often
had an interest in the system. The
few parcels of land redistributed were
allowed to peasants who had insufficient
capital to work them and had conse-
quently to borrow from the rich in
exchange for a proportion of the crop.
As it is, most of the farmers receive
hardly 20 percent of their crop and
are at the mercy of the Hadjis. Many
small landowners must work on the
land of others in order to make a mini-
mum living. The extent of peasant in-
debtedness is considerable: moreover,.
50 percent of the peasants have no
land and must hire out their services.
I met one high official in Sura-
baya, who owned more than 100
hectares in East Java, when he should
not have kept more than seven and a
half; the rest was held under the names
of different members of his family. A
Hadji and an activist of the NU (Nah-
datul Ulama the orthodox Muslim
party), he naturally hates Communists.
The PKI had understood this prob-
lem of the rural land holdings, and
since 1953 had based part of its propa-
ganda on the question of the “land-
lords.” From 1964, it entered into open
conflict with the landholding religious
groups of East Java by inciting the
landless peasants to occupy the land
belonging to the mosques. The influ-
ence of the PKI grew steadily among
this mass of small peasants who were
often Abangans (animists and followers
of Hindu cults) as against the Santris
(orthodox Muslims) allied with the
NU. Until then the PNI had made its
influence felt chiefly in the towns,
where it held most of the administra-
tive posts, leaving the NU to extend
its power in the countryside. The PKI
upset this arrangement by bringing
under its aegis a great mass of Abangan
peasants, some urban workers, and a
few Santris encouraged by President
Sukarno’s leanings toward the Com-
munist Party.
Some members of the PKI were
thus elected lurahs (village heads),
which increased the resentment of the
religious groups and of one wing of the
nationalists. Every village possesses
communal assets; about 27 percent of
the land included in these is put at the
disposal of the village offici. Is. The
Lurah can own up to 20 acres and is
also in a position to receive many sub-
stantial “presents.” The rise of the
PKI in the countryside and in the poor
districts of the towns meant for the
PNI and the NU the loss of privileges,
revenue, and prestige.
In the months before Gestapu many
clashes occurred between the rural
religious group and PKI activists.
“Unilateral action” by the landless
peasants became more frequent. The
anti-Communist forces and especially

the Muslim establishment allied with
the NU prepared to fight the PKI, as
officials of the NU have told me. Lists
of Communists w< drawn up and
young Muslims tramed in the benzirs
(the NU’s paramilitary organisation)
with the help of soldiers from the
Brawidjaja Division. But the Army,
faithful to the NASAKOM, preached
by President Sukarno, delayed the ex-
plosion by serving as a buffer between
the two adversaries. Gestapu changed
this: the bitterness engendered by this
coup and particularly the savage mur-
ders of the Army generals by the PKI
turned the scales and thereafter the
Army took no steps to discourage the
religious groups from killing Com-
munists.
“We killed the Communists because
the PKI program is opposed to the
Muslims. The PKI has always led a
campaign of terror against the Mus-
lims and against the Muslim landlords
whose lands they seized to hand them
over to their organisations, and against
the Muslim youth brigades. We killed
the Communists before they killed us.”
Adis, who is 24 years old and a
member of the East Java KAMI and
HMI (the Muslim students’ league),
told me why and how he and his “men”
had killed the Communists. The pro-
cedure varied little. The anti-
Communist students and the Muslim
dignitaries of the NU gave the Army
a list of the Communists living in such
and such a group of houses. Then
they went out 30 at a time, led by
soldiers, to search out the Communists
and drag them to the banks of a river
or into a cemetery, where they were
executed. Sometimes the soldiers under-
took this task themselves in special
camps, particularly in the case of
women; sometimes the Communists
were executed in their own homes
and occasionally with their whole
family, if they refused to come out.
Thus the Army, the NU, the KAMI,
and the nationalist groups organised a
systematic massacre of the Com-
munists. Was it by chance that the
regions where the massacres were most
ferocious Banjuwangi and Kediri
are precisely those where the landlords
are most powerful?
The violence of the massacre finds
its explanation in the Javanese charac-
ter. A Javanese expression well ex-'
presses the behaviour of the Javanese
peasants, the mata glap (black eyes).
These are the eyes of the peasant who
has said nothing for a long time, and
then gets up and kills. For long the
Muslim establishment and the PNI
suffered in silence the rise of the PKI
and the thousand humiliations that this
inflicted on them. Gestapu released this
repressed violence, which quickly
assumed huge proportions, and all the
more easily that the anti-Communist
struggle took the form of a holy war.
In killing a Communist, the Hadji
landlord preserved his interests and
committed a meritorious action. The
Muslim fanatics threw off all restraint,
particularly at Madura, where thou-
sands of Communists were killed. Most
of these were small peasants or urban
workers who had seen in the PKI
organisation the only great “family” to
concern itself in the practical manner
with their welfare. These people usually
let themselves be killed without retali-
ating, no doubt because they did not
understand what crime they had com-
mitted. The PKI fell victim to an over-
rapid expansion that left it a
“colossus with feet of clay.”
The armed forces in East Java
played an ambiguous role. Some units,
and in particular the KKO, the
Marines, who are very pro-Sukarno and
sometimes pro-PKI, were far from
hostile to the Gestapu but hesitated to
launch into an adventure that might
turn out badly for the PKI. Others,
who were pro-Sukarno and anti-PKI,
were waiting for orders from Sukarno,
who said nothing. During the first
weeks of October, 1965, only a few
units joined in, and perhaps organised,
the Communist-hunt. But these were
the Raider parachute commandos, the
best-trained units of Java’s Brawidjaja
Division, assisted by a few anti-PKI
units at the local level.
The killing was quickly organised. A
“dragnet” was put out; special camps
were established; anti-Communist
groups were trained in the use of arms,
and sometimes arms were distributed.
Commandos in civilian dress of the
RPKAD, the special forces of Colonel
Sarmo Edhie, who were liquidating the
Communists in Central Java, sometimes
joined in the operation. Within the
Army itself a vast purge was instituted,
many pro-PKI soldiers being “re-
educated” or executed. At the end of
December the Brawidjaja Division was
on the whole in action against the PKI.
But it was a little late. Behind the

conflict between the PKI and its
enemies appeared the risk of a schism
between the adherents and the ad-
versaries of Sukarno. The armed forces
of East Java who were “Sukarnoite”
with all the artificiality that implies
found difficulty in accepting the accus-
ations that the partisans of the New
Order began to bring against the Bung.
The Government at Djakarta showed
great dexterity. Instead of attacking
the problem head-on, it transformed all
its attacks on the PKI a policy on
which the whole Army was agreed—
into sidelong attacks on the PNI and
Sukarno. Little by little the soldiers
came to see Sukarno and the national-
ists as identical with the Gestapu.
Moreover the Government gradually
replaced the senior pro-Sukarno
officers.
“Where are the civilians?” I ask a
lieutenant-colonel. “There,” and he
points without irony to a crowd of . . .
soldiers. In the huge gymnasium built
at Surabaya to the glory of Pantjasila,
a few civilian costumes are lost in a sea
of uniforms, olive-green, khaki, or
maroon. All the village and district
heads have been gathered here to
attend the ceremony of the return to
the civilians of the powers entrusted to
the Army at the time of Konfrontasi.
Six generals’ hats laid on a green
cloth beneath a bas-relief displaying
the common theme of an Indonesian
wrestling with a bull surround the hat
of General Mohamed Wijono, Gov-
ernor of East Java and the “civilian”
to whom General Jasin, Commander of
the Brawidjaja Division and of the
East Javanese armed forces, was to
transfer the administrative power be-
neath a portrait of President Suharto.
The ceremony showed clearly the
power of the Army in East Java and
the solid backing it now gave to Gen-
eral Jasin. Was the crisis in the East
Java armed forces finished? The Gen-
eral receives me in his office. Small,
and dark-skinned, with expressive
“Latin” gestures, this former military
attache at Moscow brought to prom-
inence by Suharto is considered one
of the pillars of the New Order. He
informs me at once that the ceremony
proved the democratic character of the
policies the Government meant to fol-
low, but that it did not mean that
the Army was abandoning its rights:
“We will be at the civilians’ elbows,
and will intervene in case of trouble.
The Army does not intend to go into
mourning for its generals a second
time.”
In July, 1967, General Jasin, with
the other Army generals in Java, signed
at Jogja a declaration summoning all
the forces of the Old Order to adjust
themselves to a New Order without
Sukarno. “We do not want Communism
in Indonesia, nor the return of Sukarno,
which would mean the return of the
Communists . . . No, there is no great
danger of this: the Army is vigilant.
But a few small groups have still to
be destroyed. If the Army does not want
Sukarno, he has no chance of return-
ing. Of course, there are still divided
opinions within the armed forces, but
the Army has the upper hand, and it
does not want Sukarno.”
Thus the other arms have only to
follow the Army’s lead as gradually
they are, although not without occa-
sional hesitation. Clashes between the
KKO and the Raiders have diminished
considerably since their respective com-
manders were replaced. They often
take the form of private quarrels
born in particular of poaching by one
Central Djakarta scene in March, 1966, after the Army
took over power from Sukarno

group in the preserves of another
more than of ideological conflicts;
sometimes an officer is arrested. The
Navy and the police, once very Sukar-
noite, are quickly falling into line with
a regime that they have no chance of
opposing. Everyone takes part in the
Communist-hunt, and small Communist
groups are liquidated now and again.
It is hard to see how the PKI could
try anything against the Army at
present. The Government is mobilis-
ing public opinion by pointing to the
Communist “counter-attack” in East
Java, which is said to take the form
of Communist infiltration of the forces
of the Old Order i.e., the PNI. But
are not these accusations part of the
subtle Javanese game played by the
Government since Gestapu? They
justify the Army’s omnipotence and the
replacement of nationalists in profitable
posts in the administration, the Army,
and business by men of the New Order.
I visited some of those nationalists
who not long ago were still shouting
“Hidup Bung Karno!” at a PNI meet-
ing at Surabaya. The atmosphere was
fairly tense. Seated round me in the
office of one of the PNI newspapers of
Surabaya, my hosts are manifestly
anxious to speak, but afraid of commit-
ting themselves. They claim that the
PNI still has five million adherents in
East Java, not counting sympathisers:
“The PNI follows the teaching of our
leader, our father, Bung Karno. It
jwas he who invented Marhaenism.
Under pressure, we are obliged to say
that he is no longer President, but we
think none the less of him.” They deny
that they practise a personality cult, but
nevertheless have a nostalgia for the
“Great Leader of the Revolution.”
“Dr. Sukarno is a human being, like
us. Read his autobiography. We do
not believe the propaganda of the New
Order, which says he embezzled vast
sums. He can only be blamed for fol-
lowing policies too close to the PKI
and Peking. Since 1965 we have come
to reject the personality cult. Our
leader may die; what counts for us is
his teaching, not his person.”
They reproach the New Order
bitterly for its foreign policy: the end
of Konfrontasi, the appeal to the West
for help, the restoration of confiscated
property to foreign firms. For them
the New Order means the end of the
struggle against NEKOLIM, the evic-
tion from power of “the only man who
can unify our country,” and unmerited
disgrace for the PNI. But they have no
platform besides the old Sukarnoist
slogans — for Pantjasila, the “Message
of the People’s Sufferings”—(Ampera)
and NEKOLIM: “Our country is rich.
Everyone can eat. If Indonesians ate
root crops instead of rice, which is too
expensive to import, we would not have
to appeal for foreign capital.”
This party without program or dis-
cipline, attached to a discredited figure
of 66, compromised with the Gestapu
and only concerned to guard its
privileges, seems unlikely to threaten
the new regime. “Everyone loves
Sukarno, and love cannot be repressed,”
they say. But this almost feminine and
typically Javanese romanticism will not
solve Indonesia’s social problems; nor
Indonesian youths storming the Red China embassy last August

sion of the “Chinese Chinese,” which
they offer as panaceas.
“We will have to adapt ourselves to
the New Order if we do not want to
be destroyed. There has never been
any question of our trying a coup,”
they say, placing all their no doubt
illusory hopes in the forthcoming
elections. In mid-September, General
Jasin prohibited public meetings of the
PNI. The generals of the New Order
say that a common front is forming
between the Left Wing of the PNI
in East Java and the Commun'sts. This
party at bay, which its enemies call
“PNI-ASU,” after Ali Surachman,
former leader of its Left Wing but
asu also means “dog”-—certainly offers
the clandestine PKI a possible avenue
of return to the public stage. But would
not the PNI be better advised to back
the New Order than to risk destruction
and the imprisonment of its leaders by
an alliance with a PKI harried by an
army prepared to combat any attempt
at subversion?
The PNl’s youth organisations, the
GMNI (for university students) and
the GSNI (for secondary-school
students), appreciate this and seek to
avoid passing into illegality. After
Gestapu, the GMNI and GSNI joined
KAMI (the university students’ action
front), KAPI (the secondary students’
action front), and KAPPI (the chil-
dren’s front) and took an active part
in the anti-Communist struggle in East
Java. But from 1966 the alliance broke
up. Many clashes occurred between the
HMI the Muslim students of KAMI
and the nationalist students. Since
the final departure of President
Sukarno and General Jasin’s personal
intervention in favor of the much less
numerous KAMI, these have become
rarer.

A VERY SPECIAL OCCASION
This is not- an ordinary rug, but an
antique woven by tribal weavers of
Azerbaijan in the Russian Caucasus. It
is a fine example of a type no longer
available.
Each of the other 49 rugs in this
special collection is as remarkable in its
way. All were personally chosen by Denis
Croneen in Iran. Denis Croneen is a rug
enthusiast who gets as much pleasure
from the discovery of a truly interesting
tribal piece of moderate cost as from
the purchase of a rich and elegant
example from the workshop of a famous
master weaver of Isfahan, Keshan, or
Tabriz.
Our exhibition of these rugs is on until

enthusiast, a collector or above all, a

hand-made Persian rugs but is dismayed
by the numbers of trite commercial
examples so often offered today, call in

tion of helping the Cabinet to put
through its program. We want no more
of Sukarno.” So says the Chairman of
the GMlSri in East Java, a 27-year-old
student of the Faculty of Teaching at
Surabaya. At his side the chairman of
the GSNI, a secondary “schoolboy” of
22, nods approval. For some months
these two young men have been work-
ing for a rapprochement with the
Muslim students of KAMI and KAPI
by way of a common struggle against
Communism and corruption. However,
they blame KAMI for delaying student
unity by demanding that Sukarno be
put on trial, which the nationalists
naturally cannot accept.
Although more practical than their
elders and determined to make con-
cessions in order to “survive,” these
two young leaders still have no econ-
omic program. They admit that East
Java has a rural and landlord prob-
lem, but consider that does not justify
the “unilateral” action taken by the
peasants at PKI instigation. Like the
KAMI students, whom I met a little
later, they are only interested in
politics.
“Formerly,” complains a worker in
the port of Surabaya, “when we pro-
tested, people said we were paid by the
imperialists, and we went to prison.
Now they say we are Communists, and
we still go to prison.” We were in the
city’s industrial district by the Kali, the
great canal which serves as drain,
lavatory, and laundry for the district’s
“semi-proletariat.” Behind us are fac-
tories, working at half-speed; a few
unemployed are sleeping along its bank.
Everything gives an impression of
poverty and of economic stagnation.
This worker “theoretically” earns
Rupiahs 1500 (SU.S.IO) a month. A
young father of three, he can buy cloth-
ing for his family only once a year
and take them to the cinema every
three months. Everyone in his family
works, his wife, his parents, and one
of his children. But since 1951 prices
have risen considerably and the wages
are no longer enough: water costs Rps.
60 a month, rent Rps. 300, the tele-
phone Rps. 600, electricity Rps. 300,
school fees Rps. 50, an injection Rps.
150, a day in hospital Rps. 300, and a
third-class delivery of a baby Rps.
1250. Consequently he must be re-
sourceful —that is why he needs the
telephone, he must have three jobs and
take part in the vast system of cor-
ruption that rules the port of Surabaya.
He belongs more or less to that urban
“semi-proletariat” which voted for the
PKI before Gestapu and has since
“vegetated.”
The situation seems worse in the
countryside, where many peasants have
come down from the mountains from
lack of work to swell the already exces-
sive population in the plains, especially
between Surabaya and Kediri. Once
cheerful with their small houses and
red-tiled roofs, the villages have been
overrun by miserable huts. This mass
of peasants comes into conflict with the
entrenched religious groups which con-
trol every village. Almost all the
Lurahs belong to the NU, and form a
common front with the pesantrem
the NU school the benzir, the Imam,
the local military unit, which is sub-
sidised by its Hadji proteges, and the
government officials. No one dares any
longer to question its privileges. Cor-
ruption reigns as übiquitously as before
Gestapu, aggravated by the threat that
hangs over any who might dare to
protest. The mosques have recovered
their lands and a sort of social class
or caste has thus consolidated itself
since the New Order, of which it is
one of the main supports.
The maintenance of such a system in
a region where the population will
have doubled in 30 years entails the
danger of fresh violence. By tolerating
the growth of class antagonism, the
Government is likely to find itself again
facing the revolutionary problem in a
few years. Some of those in high posi-
tions perceive this and understand that
the problems of the revolution in East
Java cannot be solved simply by elim-
inating the “Communists” (or those
who are dissatisfied). But are not the
economic plans that the Government
expects to put on foot in the region
in order to provide new jobs compro-
mised in, advance by the existence of a
privileged caste? This will probably
oppose a structural reform essential if
the Government is to avoid having to
choose between a dictatorship of the
privileged and one of the people.

OVERSEAS
Has de Gaulle cried
“Non!” once too often?
TO? MEMBERS of the French ad-
ministration, including some of Presi-
dent de Gaulle’s own Ministers, are
now seriously alarmed that he may
have over-reached himself in infuria-
ting his allies and provoked them
into ganging up against France.
Word has gone out to play down the
implications of the General’s excesses.
His officials are arguing that though he
forecast the breakdown of the monetary
system, now that “the catastrophe has
begun” he is not abetting it: if he had
been, they add, the Bank of France
could have created havoc by unload-
ing 400 or 500 million dollars of its
reserves during the recent panic.
On the Common Market, it is pointed
out that he was merely reaffirming
French views on Britain’s disabilities.
Only the malevolent British Press could
suggest this represented a veto or the
slamming of doors. Credit is also
claimed for the fact that, contrary to
some Western forecasts, he did not
disavow the North Atlantic alliance—
even though two days afterwards he
allowed his Chief of Staff, General
Ailleret, to write that French defence
must be “self-contained, directed
against no one, but world-based, and
aimed at every point on the compass.”
Inside the French administration the
real wory is that he appears oblivious
to the consternation he has created and
is obviously enjoying himself. The
chances of his resignation have never
seemed more remote.
Asked by a visiting African President
recently about l’apres-Gaullism, he re-
plied that Adenauer had made a fine
chancellor at 84. This seemed to imply
that, far from thinking of retiring, he
was contemplating running again in
1972 —when he would be 83.
Whether or not age has impaired his
judgment, as many of his compatriots
argue, it has not dimmed his capacity
to communicate nor reduced the pleas-
ure he takes in shaking up the interna-
tional kaleidoscope. For example: the
alleged “anti-semitism” of his state-
ments about Israel was mainly fun-
making. Anti-semitism is not likely
in a President whose Premier (Pom-
pidou) is a former employee of the
Rothschilds, and whose Finance
Minister (Michel Debray) is the grand-
son of a rabbi.
None of his Ministers seems to have
had the least inkling he was going to
launch a secessionist appeal to the
French Canadians. He seemed to be
testing how much they would stomach.
But though the Ministers stayed
silent, their entourage let it be known
they disapproved and there was plenty
of rumbling from officials who have to
manage France’s day-to-day affairs
and are counting the cost of its
increased isolation.
The first concerted effort to manage
without France came in the monetary
field when the Central Banks agreed
at a meeting, to which France was not
invited, on measures to protect the
dollar. French officials were extra-
ordinarily distressed by their exclusion
and protested that, as they had been
founding members of the gold pool,
they had a right to participate.
Privately, however, many of them
thought the claim absurd and most of
them knew that, whether the General
likes it or not, France has neither the
means nor the political influence to
impose his views on the rest of the
financial world. They know that for
the first time serious thought is being
given in international circles to the
possibility of re-examining proposals
for the now obviously essential world
monetary reform, leaving France out.
Experts agree there is no technical
need for France to be included in any
world plan, provided all the other
major industrial countries join. Some
senior French officials believe that if
things seem to be going that way, and
particularly if gold looks like losing
its monetary role, France could not
afford to stay out.
Most French officials would agree
that, in the present context, France’s
best protection against being isolated—
or dictated to by the Americans—rests
in the solidarity of the six Common
Market countries.
Here, too, however, there is acute
worry that the General’s cavalier treat-
ment of Britain’s application may have
jeopardised the partnership.
Since his Press conference, at which
he said the Common Market would
cease to exist (taken to mean he would
destroy it) if the others insisted on
including Britain, all five have ex-
pressed their disagreement. The French
are confident that none of them is
ready to sacrifice the Market, but they
know they will certainly stall at co-
operating with the French in any other
field. M. Couve de Murville, the For-
eign Minister, and his team of highly
skilled negotiators are therefore deter-
De Gaulle at his Elysee Palace con-
ference last week
mined, to avoid a rupture and want to
argue about the French case against
Britain and more particularly against
sterling.
They hope they will at least per-
suade their colleagues there is a serious
delay. They would like to channel the
six into discussing the kind of alter-
natives suggested by de Gaulle
providing commercial facilities for
Britain and its partners without admit-
ting them into Common Market in-
stitutions. They would not, however,
agree to any plan admitting Britain at
a fixed future date, even though French
diplomats now forecast privately that
Britain will probably become a full
member by 1972 or 1973.
What remains to be seen is whether
M. Couve de Murville will be allowed
to demonstrate his talents or whether
his implacable boss, as in 1963, will
whisk him away against his will. This
time, for France, the damage might be
harder to repair.
United States
Battle for the soul
of McNamara
THE MOST PLAUSIBLE explanation
for Mr. Robert McNamara’s coming
departure from the Pentagon a year
earlier than he himself apparently ex-
pected lies probably in President
Johnson’s highly sensitive political an-
tennae.
Republican leaders, like Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan, have


already sought to make capital out of
the admitted disagreements between
the civilian Defence Secretary and the
military Chiefs of Staff. And, in the
harsh context of an approaching elec-
tion year, L.B.J. must presumably have
concluded that his Defence Secretary
was threatening to become a divisive
rather than a unifying force.
When the President made his decision
The McNamaras ... sudden concern
about his health and her ulcers
to act on Mr. McNamara’s expressed
interest in the World Bank job (and
simultaneously to brush aside Mr.
McNamara’s even more fervent offer to
stay in his present post at least until
November, 1968), L.B.J. may not have
realised quite how far that divisive pro-
cess had already gone. He can hardly
be in any doubt now.
For what took place in Washington
last week was, in essence, a battle for
the soul of Robert McNamara.
Beneath all the clamor of competing
headlines, it has, without doubt,
brought relations between the Ken-
nedys and the Johnson White House
to their lowest point ever.
At six o’clock on Monday evening
last week, Senator Robert Kennedy sud-
denly turned up at the Pentagon just
as the first reports of Mr. McNamara’s
coming move to the World Bank had
begun to sweep the Capitol.
No one is trying to pretend that such
a formal and public visit by the Senator
to his close friend and former cabinet
colleague is part of his normal day’s
routine. Certainly nothing now will
ever succeed in dislodging from the
President’s mind the conviction that
Senator Kennedy was engaged on noth-
ing less than a serious effort to get Mr.
McNamara to resign in protest against
the way he had been treated by the
President.
For, by that stage, the President knew
that things had gone very badly wrong.
Whatever way he had intended to con-
vey personally to Mr. McNamara his
intention to announce within a couple
of days his appointment to the Presi-
dency of the World Bank will presum-
ably remain one of the mysteries of his-
tory. But certainly the premature dis-
closure of the President’s intentions
in a Spanish-American paper as well as
in the “Financial Times” meant that
whatever hope there had ever been of
a tactful private intimation, followed by
a dignified joint public announcement,
had gone for ever.
The situation was, therefore, wide
open to exploitation by the President’s
political enemies.
It was bad enough that Bobby Ken-
nedy should deliberately (or so the
White House believes basing its case
on the ostentatious nature of his visit)
have rushed over straight away to the
Pentagon, thereby inevitably adding to
the atmosphere of rumor and crisis. Far
worse, however, were the pointed
questions asked the next day on the
floor of the Senate by the Senator’s
brother, Teddy Kennedy. Had Mr.
McNamara, the younger Kennedy won-
dered aloud, really left voluntarily?
Was not the truth of the matter per-
haps that he had been “transferred”
against his will?
The question was enough to spark
a storm. And Teddy Kennedy later
added to it by coolly announcing that
he had called up the Defence Secre-
tary to say that he hoped his remarks
had not embarrassed him in any way
—and had been assured that they had
not.
On Wednesday rumors devoured the
city—and some found their way into
print, including the “New York
Times.” McNamara had been “sacked”
... he had been sacrificed in the face
of a resignation threat from at least two
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
... he was going to announce that
he agreed with Bobby Kennedy that
America’s moral position in Vietnam
had been “undermined” by the latest
political justification offered for the
war.
Incredibly, for a total of 48 hours
neither the White House nor the Pen-
tagon said anything. The official
version (accompanied in the news-
papers by a description of the Presi-
dent relaxing over a soft drink after
his agony of silence was over) has it
that neither L.B.J. nor anyone else
could say anything until the Executive
Directors of the World Bank met and
formally invited Mr. McNamara to
become the bank’s new head.
There is, however, an alternative
explanation for the deafening official
silence—and in many ways it has the
stronger ring of truth.
It rests in the contention —for which
there is certainly no lack of circum-
stantial evidence —that what was going
on behind the scenes was the most
massive power play for the allegiance
of a single individual that even this
strangely medieval political capital has
ever witnessed. McNamara, so the
story goes, suddenly found himself
being torn in opposite directions. On
the one hand his old friends, the
Kennedys, wanted him to stand up and
fight to make it publicly clear that,
far from attaining his heart’s desire
at the World Bank, he had in fact been
fired, and without even being given
notice.
Simultaneously, L.B.J. was making
an appeal to Mr. McNamara’s loyalty.
Asking him to go quietly despite the
unfortunate and wholly unforeseen
situation that foreign Press leaks about
his departure had created.
How far Mr. McNamara’s decision
hung if at all in the balance is
something presumably that he will al-
ways keep to himself. But those who
watched him on Wednesday night twice
read through his curiously worded
resignation statement will always re-
main convinced that the passive course
he decided to follow had not been
reached without a struggle.
Nor is that the only suspicious cir-
cumstance. Perhaps the most un-
appetising aspect of the whole affair
lies in the heavy emphasis now being
given to the President’s warm-hearted
concern for the strain on Mr. Mc-
Namara’s health to say nothing of
the sudden rush of official sympathy
over his wife’s ulcers.
“Poor Bob,” runs a cynical comment
from a friendly source. “On Monday
evening he thought he was in the
prime of life—and then he suddenly
discovered that everyone thought he
and his wife ought to have been in the
sanatorium years ago.”
None of this, of course, bears directly
on the central issue: whether Mr. Mc-
Namara’s January departure from the
Pentagon (at a moment that he per-
sonally certainly did not choose) will
really be the prelude to a further ex-
pansion of the war in Vietnam. Yet
last week’s hidden drama could easily
affect what happens there.
Mr. Johnson may have won his battle
with the Kennedys to retain the alle-
giance of the man who has been easily
his ablest Cabinet member. As an astute
politician he can hardly, however, be
unaware that the very nature of last
week’s storm has severely restricted his
future freedom of action over the war.
The U.S. Presidency
Aplomb v. bombs
WEARING A loose-fitting grey suit
and a quiet maroon tie, the currently
most friendless figure in the U.S. Con-
gress appeared by appointment with
the national Press in Washington last
Thursday morning. It would be wrong
to describe him as striding in purpose-
fully—if anything, indeed, his whole


gait suggested that he had simply
dropped by. It was, to say the least,
an improbable entrance for a man
about to announce that he was pro-
posing to run for President against the
leader of his own Party.
But then Senator Eugene McCarthy—
even after 20 years on Capitol Hill—is
still an improbable politician. The pro-
fessionals have never known quite what
to make of him. More than any other
member of the House or Senate he has
always been his own man.
That is as obvious in his private life
McCarthy... “Gene doesn’t give a
damn”
as in his public career. There are not
many Senators’ homes in Washington
where you find on your way upstairs
two chairs with a guitar strung across
them blocking your way (“it’s all
right” you are told cheerfully after-
wards, “it’s only to keep the dog from
coming down.”) Nor, for that matter,
can there be many leading political
figures in America who—regardless of
the threat to their own careers —insist
on going to stand on the sidelines of
mass peace demonstrations if only to
make sure that an 18-year-old daughter
comes to no harm.
Gene McCarthy comes from Minne-
sota and that is probably half the
secret. He belongs to what America’s
best television commentator, Eric
Severid, has called “that cold weather
stretch of political contrariness reaching
from Wisconsin to Montana, where
something in the soil of barometric
pressure has always produced rebels.”
McCarthy’s own claim to being a
maverick is, if anything, reinforced by
the fact that he is the first Catholic to
be elected to State-wide office in pre-
dominantly Protestant Minnesota in
over 100 years.
All this, no doubt, has something to
do with his (to many people) reckless,
and (to others) romantic decision to
challenge President Johnson directly on
the Vietnam issue in at least four of
next year’s primaries.
Initially, if only because of his repu-
tation for detachment and diffidence,
he was about the last person whom the
“Dump Johnson Democrats” expected
to emerge as their champion; in fact,
when a group of professional liberals
were shopping around for a candidate
last September they did not even bother
to go and see the senior Senator from
Minnesota.
But, quietly and unostentatiously,
McCarthy had nonetheless been mak-
ing up his mind. He says today that
the decision to run was really made
for him by Dean Rusk’s performance
at a Press conference on October 12
—when the Secretary of State sud-
denly presented a new justification
for the Vietnam war in terms of the
peril of there being within a decade
“a billion Chinese armed with nuclear
weapons on the mainland of Asia.”
“There comes a moment,” McCarthy
explained over a lunch-table a week or
two later “when you just cannot let
people be denied a voice in demo-
cracy any longer. Someone had to
say, ‘You’ve gone too far.’ Someone
had to stand up against them.”
It is very much in the pattern of
McCarthy’s political history and
indeed in his youthful background as
a postulant in a Benedictine seminary
—that he should eventually have de-
cided that he had no alternative but
to be that “someone” himself. One
of the least-noticed aspects of his 20-
year career in U.S. politics is his
readiness to take risks that would
make most conventional politicians
shudder. He did exactly that when, as
a House member with ten years’
seniority, he gambled his whole poli-
tical future by successfully taking on an
establishment-backed rival Senate
nominee in a Democratic primary and
then going on to dislodge an
entrenched and popular incumbent
Republican.
The odds this time admittedly are
a great deal heavier—a fact that Mc-
Carthy publicly recognises in a way
that journalists find irresistible and
politicians infuriating. “I think” he
will say with a mocking half-smile,
“that I should acknowledge that the
President probably is the leading
candidate for the Democratic nomina-
tion in 1968 right now.”
The challenge that McCarthy pre-
sents to Johnson is not just one of
policies—at least equally it is one of
personality. Both his enemies and his
friends agree that “Gene just doesn’t
give a damn” —and it is precisely this
carefree quality that makes him a much
more serious personal threat to L.B.J.
than a routine, cautious, calculating
politician could ever be.
“You know” a Senate colleague said
to him the other day, “what I can’t
forgive you for Gene? It’s when you
discuss these serious matters —and then
give me that twinkle in your eye as if
to suggest that we’ll all have a good
laugh about it afterwards.”
McCarthy knows that one of the
things he will have to live down is his
reputation for irresponsibility and
flippancy for being the type of
politician who prefers to stand at the
back of the Senate chamber, whispering
bons mots and aphorisms rather than
taking part in the real battle going on.
But what can be a liability in a
legislator can easily be an attraction
in a candidate. Certainly all those who
heard Gene McCarthy announce his
candidature last Thursday, and deal
with super aplomb with the questions
afterwards, were in no doubt that there
had suddenly emerged on the American
political scene the wittiest and most
literate political figure since the early
days of Adlai Stevenson.
Stevenson, though, eventually became
no more than a martyr for another
man’s triumph—and the most informed
estimate remains that that is the best
McCarthy can ever hope for. But,
again, what totally defeats other poli-
ticians is that he appears genuinely not
to mind.
Would he, he was asked the other
day, if the cards fell that way, stand
aside and make way for Bobby Kennedy
as Johnson’s challenger in 1968. “Well”
he said, this time grinning broadly, “I
don’t know a'bout stepping aside it
might not be quite as voluntary as that
—though I want to make it clear that
I don’t necessarily see that as a great
disaster.” (In private he had already
told Kennedy that if he (Kennedy)
should feel compelled eventually to
make a move and take the whole thing
over “then that’s perfectly all right
with me.”)
Aden
Fish 'n' chips stay
OVERNIGHT, from being an English
town (with a British population of
50,000), Aden has become dramatically
and irrevocably Arab. The NAAFI
Forces’ radio and cinema, British
newspapers, clubs, and security reports
have gone, and with them nearly all
trace of British rule. The peacocks
from Government House lawns have
been packed off to the zoo. The few
remaining British civilians are not the
nostalgic kind.
The old order simply vanished and
few people, British or Arabs, have any
regrets. The whirring of the heli-
copters, the Fleet offshore, the endless,
restless movement of Army trucks and
prowling foot patrols, the deathly quiet
of the streets at night were suddenly,
almost miraculously, replaced by
quite a different scene.
The streets exploded with people.
At midnight on November 30 the back
alleys of Crater were as bright as if it
were midday. Someone placed a blaz-
ing torch on top of the hill dominating


Crater. NLF militiamen in new khaki
uniforms and Cuban-style peaked
forage caps waved their submachine-
guns at you and called out in a friendly
enough way. There were giant pic-
tures of Nasser, of the “masses” march-
ing, and of NLF commandos hurling
grenades at British soldiers.
But Aden, having broken most de-
colonisation precedents already, re-
mained perverse to the end. There
was no attempt at a formal ceremonial
hand-over of sovereignty, and none of
the reassuring and euphoric para-
phernalia which customarily hallows
the moment when Britain, having per-
formed its sacred duty, sets its children
free. Indeed, with the Governor, Sir
Humphrey Trevelyan, gone and the
NLF leadership absent in Geneva, it
A handshake from Lord Shackleton, the
chief British negotiator at Geneva, and
129 years of British rule in Aden ends
as NLF leader Qahtan As-Shaabi form-
ally accepts independence of the
republic
wasn’t at all clear whether the new
State was independent or not.
Sir Humphrey left almost unobtru-
sively a day before the withdrawal
was completed. A small, almost
gnome-like figure, large of ear and
nose and brilliant of mind, he wished
the Arab people well. Senior Arab
Army officers, with whom the British
have consistently maintained close and
friendly relations, and the Press saw
him off.
He left having achieved Britain’s two
main objectives: a peaceful and smooth
withdrawal and good prospects of a
strong and stable State being created.
But he also left with a sense of per-
sonal failure. It all worked out in the
end, but it is not the way he would
have chosen.
British businessmen reckon that trade
and ordinary life now stand a good
chance of returning to something like
normal. The atmosphere has improved
steadily all week.
The Arabs, too, are happy, for
whether they hate the British or not
—and on a personal footing probably
few of them do the military base
and the colonial regime had combined
to become a symbol of intolerable op-
pression. There was, of course, an ele-
ment of convenience in this, and the
removal of the British whipping boy
is going, in some ways, to make life
tougher for the new rulers.
Suddenly, with the departure of the
troops, Aden began to breathe again.
Security walls and barbed-wire barriers
were torn down, doors and windows
opened, and a wildly excited, shouting,
and chanting multitude gushed on to
the streets like champagne from a
bottle.
Fleeting images stay vivid in the
mind. Sharp, wolf-faced Arab children
leaning out of their school-bus windows
waving toy (?) pistols, chanting “NLF,
NLF,” sunburnt “paras” camped among
the pastel-colored salt pans and dere-
lect windmills, guarding the side of the
airfield facing the desert wastes to the
north.
Empty, fly-blown houses at Tarshyne,
near Government House, once the smart
homes of top civilian and military offi-
cials. Sulphur-colored security lights
ablaze night and day over the deserted,
and already decaying, Service families’
flats in Khomak-Sar. The dark, un-
inhabited corridor of apartment blocks
in the Maalla Mile.
Andre Rochat, intrepid Swiss Red
Cross man, striding out of the Crescent
Hotel and disappearing into the back
streets of Steamer Point as the bullets
and mortars crackled and thumped
around him, his hat at a jaunty angle.
Wild scenes at the airport when the
NLF Geneva delegation returned, and
a first collective look at the high com-
mand—small, compact, unsmiling men
with heavy moustaches. (The New
Government has been formed and is
functioning. Meetings are already be-
ing held in Government House.)
And lines of cars slowly driving
through formerly exclusive British areas
at dusk and finishing up at “Ali Baba’s”
mobile fish-and-chip canteen. One of
the few durable legacies of the British
here is the Arab addiction to fish and
chips.
Laos
Hide and seek
WAR IN LAOS has as much likeness
to Vietnam as Gilbert and Sullivan to
grand opera, but even so it has man-
aged to create a quarter of a million
refugees in a country that has per-
haps only three million population. No
one knows the exact population; in this
part of the world today it is easier to
count refugees than ordinary people.
In Sam Thong, 75 miles north of the
capital, Vientiane, the refugees at least
have not been forgotten by the
Americans, that is. Six years ago Sam
Thong did not exist, now bulldozers
have smoothed out a dirt airstrip, tak-
ing care to leave untouched the grass-
covered grave of an important tribal
chief. Three small Air America planes
that work off the strip have to taxi
round it as they fly in and out, taking
supplies to refugee centres in the
mountains to the north.
In a warehouse by the airstrip there
is everything, from medicines and blan-
kets to bags of the new high-protein
synthetic food called Celapro that is
made to look like rice. “It’s marvellous
stuff,” said a young American aid
worker. “You can do anything with it
and it’s quite tasteless.”
One gets a feeling that the Ameri-
cans want their activities here to be
like Celapro that is, highly effect-
ive but hard to identify. But their pres-
ence in Sam Thong is overwhelming.
Although only a dozen Americans work
here, the whole place is underpinned
by their machinery, money, and know-
how.
The same is true for all Laos. En-
tirely because of the Vietnam war,
America is helping Laos to the tune of
U. 5.557 million a year, plus complete
financing of the Laotian Army at a
cost that is undisclosed.
And yet, such are conditions in this
extraordinary country that the Ameri-
cans do not even pretend they are
achieving more than a holding opera-
tion.
In the south-east, the North Viet-
namese run men and supplies along
the so-called Ho Chi Minh trail into
South Vietnam, and not even Laotian
generals pretend that the Laotian
Army could or should do anything to
stop them. Similarly, no one really
expects the Laotians to drive out the
North Vietnamese from the north-
eastern provinces that shield Hanoi’s
own border.
These two areas are of vital import-
ance to Hanoi, and the 40,000 North
Vietnamese combat and support troops
actually in Laos would react vigor-
ously to any serious attempt to inter-
fere there. The fact is that everyone in
Laos, foreigners included, lives in awe
of the North Vietnamese. “The
moment a North Vietnamese division
put its nose out of the mountains,
we’d all be across the Mekong and
into Thailand in a flash,” said one
diplomat in Vientiane. By contrast
no one is much scared by the Pathet
Lao, the communist-led Laotian
guerillas, who number about 28,000.
It is because of the North Viet-
namese threat that the Government of
Prince Souvanna Phouma has accepted
increasing American presence, in spite
of the neutrality imposed on Laos by
the Geneva Agreements.
But the need to respect the shib-
boleth of neutrality has prevented the
Americans from making the most effec-
tive use of their presence. “We comport
ourselves so that we conform to the


Geneva Agreements,” said a senior
American diplomat. And it is true.
Officially, there are no American mili-
tary advisers, but only a Defence At-
tache’s office with a mammoth staff of
72.
Twenty quartermaster-sergeants and
the like, under U.S. aid cover, organise
the Laotian Army’s supplies, but have
no control over how they are used. This
is scarcely desirable in a country where
corruption is almost the only source of
serious income, apart from opium.
Inevitably there are plenty of rumors
in Vientiane saying that there are many
more Americans here than the official
figure of under 12,000.
The only significant change in the
ambiguous American position would be
the introduction of fighting troops. And
there is full awareness among Ameri-
cans of the horrors that would involve.
Lee makes
himself clear
From DENNIS BLOODWORTH in Singapore
A RATHER sulky morning-after feel-
ing has followed Mr. Lee Kuan Yew’s
rousing reception in Washington, sadly
demonstrating that the Asian analysis
of their own situation and the Ameri-
can analysis of it rarely mix.
Picking their way carefully through
the Singapore Prime Minister’s speeches
delivered in the United States, Ameri-
cans protest that he clearly indicated
his belief that if they showed their
determination to stick things out in
Vietnam by voting President Johnson
back into power next year, they would
be able to bring Hanoi to the confer-
ence table. This appeared an un-
ambiguous endorsement of their policy
in Vietnam from a progressive, freely-
elected Asian Premier who commanded
respect among the non-aligned nations.
On his return to Singapore, however,
Lee stilled the voices of those who
accused him of committing Singapore
to Washington’s battle-line by insisting
his meaning had been distorted by the
Pi •ess. He replied in television inter-
views reflecting a critical and in-
dependent outlook—“I am not going
to be the monkey of the American
organ-grinder,” he said.
Some U.S. officials were shocked,
unwilling to see that an astute poli-
tician must balance the mood of Asia
against the might of America, the
odium against the advantages of that
Texan handshake. Mr. Lee cannot
speak for the leaders of other weak
States on this subcontinent, but he
shares with them the acrid flavor of
specifically Asian anxieties, which
Americans may analyse but cannot
themselves taste.
It is “very possible,” says Lee, that
the Americans are still thinking of
uniting South-East Asia against Com-
munist China by stimulating local
nationalist feeling against the Chinese
—an unpleasant prospect for a pre-
dominantly Chinese Singapore jammed
between the two Muslim Malay States
of Indonesia and Malaysia.
Hand out no offensive weapons, he
begs. With Russia, America, and China
fighting for influence and arming their
rival client States, South-East Asia
could become a ring in which the small
men battered each other to death under
arrangements made by the big-power
fight promoters who stayed outside. On
the contrary, says Lee, all must work
to an international guarantee, under-
written by every country concerned,
that no frontier in this area will be
changed by force.
Lee Kuan Yew believes that mutual
trust and economic co-operation be-
tween the nations of South-East Asia
must precede frontier guarantees and
defence pacts, but that eventually they
should observe the principle that an
attack on one would be an attack on
all. This is the security pattern for the
area that Asians will be given the neces-
sary breathing space to draw if the
Americans have the staying power to
struggle on until they can find a
political solution to the Vietnam con-
flict, he adds.
This is why he wants the Americans
to stay in Vietnam. But this does not
imply approval of their involvement, as
some Americans think. For Lee and
many like him, the Vietnam situation is
the disastrous result of 13 years of con-
sistent error. Since the Americans have
made “their bed of roses,” however,
they must now lie on it. A short-cut
through escalation would be foolhardy
and might well bring China into the
war and China’s answer to the
nuclear threat would be to let her
monstrous armies pour over the fron-
tiers and overrun the countries the
Americans were trying to protect. On
the other hand, Lee believes, if the
United States pulled out of Vietnam
the Chinese would subvert the sub-
continent through local Communist
parties, and South-East Asia would
bend like bamboo to the wind.
Lee has said that Singapore cannot
stay neutral if her survival is at stake.
The phrase pleased watchers in Wash-
ington, but in fact it only means that
Lee will join no fight until the
sovereignty of Singapore itself is men-
aced. He is a non-Communist, and he
wants to join nobody’s “team,” no
power bloc, whether American, French,
Russian, or Chinese.
Lee points out that Marshal Kittika-
chorn, the Thai Prime Minister, has
said: “We will fight in Vietnam, but
not in Thailand.” Tengku Abdul Rah-
man of Malaysia said in August: “We
do not want to turn this country into
a battlefield. If a big country like
Communist China wants to take us . . .
we will surrender.” Should the Ameri-
cans lose patience, Lee says, and should
a bogus peace in Vietnam open the
door for a takeover by the National
Liberation Front, Chinese Communist
power will in time dominate the con-
tinent as far west as Iran.
The key to a successful U.S. policy
in Asia, Lee implies, is in an under-
standing of the Asian mood. Shy of
socialism, the Americans fasten almost
magnetically on to ambitious generals
and conservative cliques that represent
a small, often discredited minority in
an emergent continent.
There is a revulsion from the length-
ening queue of those who shuffle cap-
in-hand up to the American paydesk,
and from the sort of divisions-for-
dollars deal that has taken 48,000 South
Korean troops to Vietnam in exchange
for massive United States economic
assistance. Lee has declared he would
rather be dead than “a paid political
and economic eunuch.”
Behind the Asian thesis, as Lee pro-
pounds it, is the profound belief that
politics and not gimmicks decide the
victory, but that the Americans place
their reliance in gimmicks fleets, jets,
the bombing of North Vietnam.
According to Lee, the Americans should
Lee Kuan Yew ... no monkey of the
American organ-grinder
concentrate entirely on extending the
“pacified” areas in South Vietnam.
Lee Kuan Yew, whose People’s
Action Party defeated Communism in
Singapore by giving the masses a square
deal, itches to see the native South
Vietnamese encouraged to produce their
own uncorrupt, popular party, acting
in the interests of the people and not
the pockets of its leaders. He believes
such a party could really challenge and
neutralise the fair promises of the Viet-
cong.
Lee’s weakness is that he has prac-
tised what he preaches only in 224
square miles of island territory and
among fewer than two million people.
He does not know the heartbreaking
conditions of Vietnam, the poor politi-
cal tools that snap even in the gentlest
American hands. But millions of Asians
would agree that his diagnosis goes to
the heart of the matter. It is the psy-
chological, not the logistic, analysis that
counts in an underpriviledged contin-
ent today. And it is the Communists,
not the Americans, who are currently
the better analysts.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A guaranteed wheat price
based on politics
IF THE COUNTRY PARTY didn’t
get much last week in the way of direct
compensation for the effects of de-
valuation on the fortunes of their elec-
toral clients, they did manage to ram
through one very valuable concession.
That was the 9c increase in the guar-
anteed wheat price. This is the biggest
rise since the period of galloping in-
flation in the late 19405. It is already
having its effect on the components of
the cost-of-living index, with flour
prices rising in sympathy by $4.50 a
ton this week and bread will no
doubt follow suit.
The guaranteed price is based on
politics, the desire to do the right
thing by wheat farmers. That is the
only basis for a rise in the guaranteed
price an attempt to compensate
farmers for their drought losses and to
calm them down over the Wheat
Board’s s3om. “government policy” de-
valuation loss. It is high time all the
phony economic jargon in which the
announcement of the guaranteed price
is wrapped up each year and scrapped.
The idea of there being such a thing
as “cost of production” of a bushel of
wheat is ridiculous. Wheat farms are so
varied in their topography, soils, and
climatic experience that costs vary tre-
mendously from one place to another.
The idea that actual farmers could be
covered by any statistical average is
plain silly.
Even sillier, of course, is the way
in which the figure is arrived at. A
completely notional yield is applied to
the overall costs, a yield which in-
cidentally is well below the average.
The whole exercise is really an elab-
orate public relations exercise de-
signed to cover the fact (the justice
of which we do not debate here) that
Bulk-loading wheat for Red China
the wheat farmers are getting a big
Government subsidy.
One result of this extra payment will
be to increase the trend for farmers in
marginal areas to try to grow wheat
rather than remain in the unhappy
wool industry. This could mean the re-
placement of a wool problem with a
wheat one. While wheat sales to China
remain high (and seasonal conditions
remain bad), this huge and increasing
wheat acreage will not cause serious
difficulties. But the prospect of Com-
mon Market surpluses (resulting from
their absurdly high domestic price sys-
tem) flooding Australia’s markets
sooner or later must not be discounted;
and the Chinese even may discover, if
Mao finds the right thought for it,
how to grow enough wheat to feed
themselves.
Standards
Vehicle heights
THE CURRENT INTERSTATE dis-
pute over vehicle height standards is
an excellent illustration of the inade-
quacy of the Commonwealth’s current
approach to co-ordination. It sees com-
mittees set up and then off into
complete uninterest. We have an Aus-
tralian Transport Advisory Council of
State Transport Ministers and an Aus-
tralian Motor Vehicle Standards Com-
mittee. It is easy enough for them to
work out what the standards should be.
In this particular case they set on 14ft.
as a sensible national standard. Every-
one accepts this. But the Victorians,
for historical reasons, find almost half
their bridges are built to 12ft. 6in. or
13ft. standards and understandably they
do not want to be committed to a
program of rebuilding them on their
own.
The obvious solution is for the Com-
monwealth, through its Bureau of Roads
or its Department of Shipping and
Transport, to step in and propose a
formula for joint sharing of the burden
of upgrading Victorian bridges: say a
three-way split of the cost between the
Commonwealth, Victoria, and the rest
of the States. It is ridiculous that
failures in Commonwealth initiatives
should threaten to deny the national
economy the economies to be had
through the use of containers and other
modern transport innovations. It is
also high time that standards for
vehicles were established to prepare
for the container era.
Korman
The third report
MR. PETER MURPHY, QC, has
taken four years to get to the bottom
of the Korman company distress. His
three reports, of which the final one
was tabled in the Victorian Assembly
last week, is the best and most satisfy-
ing of the lot, because it confirms with
admirable maturity in his style and
understanding the tentative finding of
the first two—that cross-transactions
between the public companies and the
family proprietaries held the darkest
secrets which kept the public so long
in ignorance of how so much of its
money (about $5O million all told)
invested in the group went down the
drain.
Of the innumerable cross-dealings
unravelled from the tangled skein,
this last report, as did the first one (on
Stanhill Development Finance), high-
lights the “round robin” cheque-passing
of February, 1961, as having special
significance, its estimation being that
the family companies made $391,862
out of it. The report also brings to light
the fact that in October, 1963, Korman
and his family sold their shares in one
of the key family companies, Park
Lake, for $BOO,OOO, or four times their
par value—that is, at a time when the
public companies were mostly in ruins.
The latter sale explains in part why the
family nest-egg in the private com-
panies at June 30, 1965, Mr. Murphy’s
latest date of estimation, was much
smaller even than ten years earlier.
However, much dirty water had


flowed under the bridge after the col-
lapse of the Korman public companies
in which the private ones had sub-
stantial shareholdings. A drop of $1.3
million in the market value of such
holdings sharply reduced shareholders’
funds of the private companies after
the boom and by 1965 their main assets
were shares in Factors, the Banyule
estate and $188,918 owed them by
Stanley Korman, which, together with
other properties, made shareholders’
funds of the main private companies
$964,096 in June, 1965, compared with
$1,806,978 in 1955.
These figures will provide much food
for thought for Victoria’s Attorney-
General, as will the matters raised by
the investigator apropos the issue of the
prospectus for Chevron Sydney, which,
like that for SDF in earlier proceedings,
the AG could well further explore in
the courts, as Mr. Murphy obliquely
recommends he might do.
Indeed, what with the “round robin”
as another possible affair for further
ventilation in higher legal places, it
may yet be too early to phrase Stanley
Korman’s commercial epitaph. At the
moment Mr. Murphy puts it tentatively
like this: “Stanley Korman had broad
vision, great drive and ambition, and
remarkable powers of persuasion. But
he lacked prudence, commonsense,
patience, and a sense of responsibility.
He was never satisfied with his achieve-
ments. He had early successes in
Queens Road, Melbourne, and Para-
dise Island. Thereafter he refused to
pay heed to the advice of anyone who
counselled him to be cautious.”
Town planning
“Growth corridors"
TOWN PLANNING DOCTRINE
now appears to have turned full circle.
Having started in the ’thirties with a
strong aversion to ribbon development
of cities spiderweb-like along the trans-
port routes radiating out from the
centre, it strongly urged the contain-
ment of metropolitan areas by a green
belt. Everywhere in the world where
this was tried it failed, even in Lon-
don, where such drastic steps as blanket
bans on new office-building were im-
posed. After a series of studies of Lon-
don the planners have turned up a
strategy of suburban development based
on “growth corridors” really a
rather slick way of describing planned
ribbon development along the trans-
port routes leading out from the city.
These corridors are not intended to be
solid urban development, but only
small bits of countryside or park will
intrude. They are to be serviced by
freeways and electric railways running
the length of the radials, and connect-
ing ring roads as well.
The British are by no means original
in this strategy, for it has been adopted
as a general planning principle in a
number of other cities, notably Stock-
holm, Copenhagen, Paris, and Wash-
ington. The green belt containment
idea has always seemed to have rather
a lot of that Canutian quality about it.
And it looks as though our plannners
need to update themselves.
Shipping
Worth the struggle
THE SHIPPING WAR in the Aus-
tralia-Far East trade is over: the cut-
price freight rates it brought to the
Australia-Japan trade will end next
year. The Atlas Line partners (Blue
Star, Port Line, and Ellerman and
Bucknall) have agreed to pull out of
their fight with the eight-member Aus-
tralian-North-bound conference in ex-
change for a slice of the business
immediately the two British conference
members on the route decide to put.
on wholly or partly containerised or
unitised ships.
So, after a “worthwhile struggle” cost-
ing “less than £stg.-| million” (accord-
ing to Blue Star’s general manager, Mr.
J. G. Payne), the Atlas threesome have
forced P. & O. and the Swire group to
admit them to what will now be a
five-member container consortium (in
which P. & O. and Swires will have the
major share). It looks as if the Jap-
anese members of the conference, who
carry most of this trade, may have
mounted some pretty strong pressure on
their two British colleagues to give the
Atlas men a share of their business and
so end the price-cutting. The British
did as they were told.
Reserve Bank
The new deputy governor
APPARENTLY MR. H. M. KNIGHT,
who will become deputy governor of
the Reserve Bank when Mr. Jock
Phillips moves up to the governorship
on Dr. Coombs’s retirement next year
rated his chances of getting the job
no higher than that of other senior
colleagues and didn’t dismiss the pos-
sibility of somebody being appointed
from outside. But then Knight is a
modest sort of fellow. At 48 and mana-
ger of the Bank’s investment depart-
ment for the past three years, he has
been moving around in the stratosphere
there for some time, having done con-
siderable stints in the research depart-
ment (the successor of the old econo-
mics department) and at the Inter-
national Monetary Fund as statistician.
As successor to HLIC’s Ernest Eyers
as boss of the investment department,
Harry Knight has looked after the
bank’s interests in the short-term money
market (there are mixed feelings in
the market about his spell there, but
money-market operators are a pretty
glum lot, anyway) along with the in-
vestment of its foreign exchange re-
serves (and a fair bit has been written
about these in the last few weeks).
Before his career at the bank, which
began at 16, was interrupted by six
years or so in the Forces, divided about
equally between the Army and the
Navy and getting the DSC for survey
work, Knight started a commerce
course in his spare time at the uni-
versity in Melbourne, where he was
born and went to school (Scotch). He
finished it in 1948 and it grew into a
master’s degree as a result of a thesis
written on the basis of his subsequent
spell at the IMF a few years later.
Harry Knight confesses to be an
enthusiastic committeeman but most
H. M. Knight
of his committees outside the bank have
the distinction of being associated with
church work, in which he has an.
ardent interest. He’s on the Property
Trust of the Church of England in
Sydney, where he now lives with his
wife and five children, who range from
five to 15. He should make a very
accessible deputy governor, is not at
all shy of Press criticism so long as it
it well-informed, and any of it plug-
ging more flexible interest rates he
likes the better.


BRIEFLY
For the economyS Referring to the British devalu-
ation the Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, suggests: “There is
reason to believe that in the longer term, the effects on our
economy should be favorable.”
The Reserve Bank’s holdings of gold and foreign exchange
were reduced by $99.9 million as a result of the devaluation
and the bank will eventually lose another $4O million on
forward commitments.
The guaranteed price of 1967-68 faq wheat has been put
up 9 cents to 164 cents a bushel, its largest increase in 14
years . . . Post-devaluatoin wool prices moved up slightly
for merinos, comebacks, and fine crossbreds.
October retail sales, $600.9 million, rose $37.2 million
above the October, 1966, total and were only $4.6 million
less than May’s (1967) record.
For the markets S Led by BHP and a broad collec-
tion of prominent miners and oils, Australian share markets
are staging a broad retreat; turnovers are not high.
In London the erratic week surely signifies anticipation
of further economic restrictions . . . Wall Street looked
rather mixed in subdued dealings.
For companies i Depressed on the share markets, the
miners are far from inactive elsewhere . . . Yet lead and
zinc complex E.Z. Industries fitted the present mood by
stating that profitability would be under some strain in the
current year; it also confessed to testing certain W.A. nickel
prospects without result . . . Lower nickel assays in Great
Boulder’s areas apparently call for more detailed geological
investigation, to be financed by a l-for-5 issue of 25-cent
shares at $4.50 a share and giving a raising of $3,150,000
. . . Peko-Wallsend has won Mount Morgan, with (at
present) a 54.6 percent holding of ordinary capital . . .
Funds will soon be needed by Western Mining to finance
expansion; they will come from a share issue, loans, and
retained earnings.
On the gas front, Santos-Delhi-Taylor has a strike at
Daralingie, a little closer to Adelaide than Gidgealpa and
Moomba . . . Alliance Oil Development proposes to raise
$2 million by a l-for-5 par issue.
Investor and island trader W.R. Carpenter holds out hopes
for a higher profit in its current year . . . British Tobacco’s
parent profit went up nominally by $95,853 to $4,932,031;
the group dividend remains 12 percent . . . Food didn’t
bring luck to wholesale butcher Tancred Bros., which has
lost $77,248 and pays 5 percent from reserves.
Retailer Myer Emporium’s $l2 million debenture issue
was an open-and-shut job, oversubscribed . . . Grocer and
produce merchant Permewan Wright sounds pleased with
“a good increase” in half-year earnings . . . Anthony
Hordern is still expecting an increase in profit . . . Cox
Bros., among other things, lost $2.6 million in the year to
July 1.
Another member of the loss brigade, appliance maker
A.G. Healing, predicts a current year “without loss” . . .
Timber supplier George Hudson merely wishes to be
“more favorably placed.”
Lower tax helped Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)
in a 15 percent profit advance, to $2,039,839; dividend stays
at 16 percent.
Ansett Transport Industries is experiencing faster growth
with Ansett-ANA . . . Factors, which owns Holeproof N.Z.,
went up from $295,377 to $567,273, to give a 7.4 percent
earning rate . .. An anonymous buyer is after an 11 percent
holding (first come, first served) in the Australia Hotel.
MEN AND MATTERS
HE’S NOT A PHILIPS man and he’s
not a Pom; the new man at the top
of the local Pye Industries Ltd. is a
New Zealander, 57-year-old Tom
Spencer, who is moving up from gen-
eral manager and a director of Pye’s
New Zealand operations (the highly
successful Pye Electronics Ltd. of Auck-
land). He is taking over the Australian
managing-director job that Peter Threl-
fall vacated to become managing direc-
tor of the British parent company, Pye
of Cambridge Ltd., following “the
troubles” with top management and the
Philips takeover.
T. J. F. Spencer is a remarkable
combination of banker and electronics
man. Born in Palmerston North, he
joined the Bank of New Zealand after
leaving school in 1927 and collected a
diploma in banking and professional
accountancy qualifications in between
playing with radios (he was an en-
thusiastic “ham” until he got married;
the two don’t mix). So when the war
came, he ended up a certified radio
technician in the RNZAF. After it,
electronics appealed more to him than
banking, and in 1947 he was offered
the job of managing a radio factory,'
Akrad Radio Corporation, that was in
the care of the Public Trustee follow-
ing the death of its owner. Five years
later he encouraged the Public Trustee
to sell its shareholding to Pye because
he considered the coming of televisison
(when the Government eventually
allowed it to come) would mean a
need for a “big brother.” Three years
later, he was running the local Pye
show (and, like Peter Threlfall, he will
remain on the N.Z. company’s board
while in his Sydney job).
The upheaval of moving will mean
the end of many of his “outside” in-
terests, like being chairman of the
N.Z. Council for Technical Education,
an active member of the Auckland
Manufacturers’ Association (of which
he is a past president), the Auckland
Rotary Club and the N.Z. Institute of
Management. And he is also a director
of N.Z. Newspapers Ltd., Sanford Ltd.,
and the Auckland Theatre Trust. But
his family upheaval (his wife has six
weeks to get ready in) will not be so
great now that his two sons are both
married and off his hands.
One thing Tom Spencer has already
made quite clear; Philips are leaving
Pye to run itself and are not taking
control, even though they have owner-
ship.
NEW ZEALAND HAD also provided
the early business training for the late
Mr. A. C. Hatrick, chairman and
former managing director of Australian
Chemical Holdings Ltd., who died last
week. Born in Ballarat 76 years ago,
Tom Spencer
A. C. Hatrick
Mr. Hatrick had gone to school at
Wanganui, N.Z., and did not return
to Australia until he was 26. With the
experience he gained from importing
and merchandising in N.Z., he set up in
Sydney in 1917 as an importer of
chemicals for the paint industry. In
1940 he began to make synthetic resins;
in 1954 his company went public (Aus-
tralian Chemical Holdings 'has the same
initials as his name), and in 1965 the
U.S. company Hercules Powder
acquired a majority interest.
Mr. Hatrick retired as managing
director barely one year ago, but had
remained chairman. He was also on
the hoards of United Holdings and
Portfolio and Developments Ltd., a
company formed basically to acquire
his extensive investment portfolio.


How many strings to McPherson’s bow? mp
A large number. But then
McPherson’s have been first
fiddle in the engineering
field for more than 100
years. They enjoy a world
reputation as manufacturers
of machine tools, pumps,
bolts and nuts and engineer-
ing supplies. They are also
famous for their research
facilities. McPherson’s
operate one of the world’s
largest bolt works and other
strings include the manu-
facture of twist drills, hack-
saw blades, cutting tools
and other products through
many subsidiary compan-
ies. In fact, in merchandis-
ing— with its associated
technical services, in manu-
facturing — particularly of
Macson lathes and Ajax
pumps, and in their fastener
division with Ajax bolts
and nuts, they don’t come
any bigger than McPher-
son’s. But the size of the
bow is never as important
as the quality of the perfor-
mance.

The way to tap
By R. H. HARDING
Manager Investment, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia
(A paper presented to a recent CEDA seminar in Melbourne)
THE STORY OF U.S. investment in
Australia is undoubtedly just beginning
to be written. We may be good savers,
but internal resources cannot satisfy
our appetite for growth. Mineral de-
velopments are continuing. Our immi-
gration program demands added capi-
tal. The pace of technological develop-
ment based on the wealthier economies,
particularly the U.S., leads to even
more capital requirements.
Although I do not have a reliable
figure for the total value of overseas
investment in Australia, in 1946 it was
already very substantial. Even so, fig-
ures compiled by the U.S. Department
of Commerce indicate that not greatly
over $lOO million had been invested
here by U.S. companies. In the next
10 years to 1956, $325 million was in-
vested here, in the 5 years after that
$506 million, in the period 1961 to
1966 another $lO5B million, making
$1.9 billion ($lOOO million) since the
war (a dramatic increase on the $lOO
million of 1946).
Of course, Britain was also invest-
ing heavily in Australia during this
time, and in the 20 years since World
War II Britain has invested $2.6 billion
in Australian companies still ahead
of U.S. in post-war aggregate invest-
ment, • though in the 5 years to
1966 the two countries broke even,
each contributing a little over $1 mil-
lion.
Thus the established pattern of re-
lationships has been changing quickly.
Not only have new ownership pat-
terns emerged, but changes have
occurred in manufacturing and market-
ing philosophy, and even in the phil-
osophy of ownership. Australians have
seen an unwillingness exhibited by
many U.S.-controlled companies to in-
vite Australian participation at local
company level. Strong objections to this
have persisted, even though this policy
is far from being all bad for Australia,
which has in many cases received a
greater amount of much-needed over-
seas capital this way, and left U.S.
investors to bear 100 percent of losses
on ventures which have failed.
Wholly owned subsidiaries of U.S.
companies tend to enjoy freer and
cheaper accesss to processes and tech-
nology than do their partly owned
counterparts, and to pay less in
management fees. The companies
themselves have no doubt seen advan-
tages in remaining free of the need to
account regularly to public share-
holders in Australia, and to meet Stock
Exchange requirements. On the other
hand, they have suffered in their public
image by failing to have a receptive
group of local people among whom to
disseminate information and explain
company philosophy and progress.
More recently, offers seeking majority
rather than whole ownerships of estab-
lished ventures have become more
common. Politically this is encouraged,
and I admit to a strong personal pref-
erence for some local participation in
all major overseas-controlled com-
panies. Economically, however, the net
benefit of such participation may not
be as significant as it seems.
Perhaps the great emotional out-
bursts of the past arose as a result of
the success of U.S. investment. Accord-
ing to the Treasury, all U.S. invest-
The overseas hand in CRA
In the overall context of overseas
investment, mining has been playing
an increasing part and (including oil
exploration) direct overseas private
investment increased from $29 mil-
lion or 7.2 percent in 1963/4 to $llO
million or 25 percent two years later
(that is, in 1965/6). This excludes
the effects of portfolio investment
and loans, so that in terms of total
capital inflow mining probably
accounted for 35 percent to 40 per-
cent in 1965/6.
The story of CRA and its major
associated companies provides an in-
teresting case study in the evolution
of overseas investment in Australian
industry.
Immediately after World War 11,
Zinc Corporation and its main
associated company, the Broken Hill
Associated Smelters, employed just
$lO million of funds. Ten years later
New Broken Hill Consolidated had
become established, the Rio Tinto
Mining Company of Australia had
entered as an independent company,
and the funds employed by the two
groups had climbed to the combined
total of $42 million.
By 1961, the pattern as we know
it today was emerging. Tfie balance
sheets compiled by the Australian
organisations of Consolidated Zinc
and Rio Tinto in 1961 were the final
ones to be issued prior to the merger.
Both reflected the beginnings of U.S.
participation, the one through
aluminium and a small chemical
venture, and the other through iron
ore, which was then at the early
exploration stage. Combined share-
holder and borrowed funds employed
then were $l2O million, with $l9
million provided from U.S. sources
and the remainder from U.K. and
Australia.
It is worth while looking at the
current situation in a little more
detail. Firstly, who owned and
financed this composite but closely
associated group of companies?
Shareholders provided 46 percent of
the funds ($239 million), and due to
the influence of American lending to
the aluminium and iron ore ventures
borrowed, moneys financed 54 percent
or $276 million. No less than 81
percent of these borrowings were
obtained from American banks and
institutions, with Australia providing
the balance. Equity ownership was
shared by Australia 31 percent;
Britain 53 percent; United States
15 percent; and others 1 percent.
Another question is: What has been
the impact on Australia’s balance of
payments? If we look at the effect
of the revenue account operation, we
find that while dividends plus profits
reinvested for overseas shareholders
totalled million, foreign
exchange earnings from exports just
reached $lOO million. Of this latter
sum $A.20.8 million was received in
SU.S. With heavy borrowings, capi-
tal account transactions were, of
course, favorable in 1966.
With the imminent growth of sales
of iron ore, bauxite, and aluminium,
the total exports of this group of
companies should reach $240 million
by 1970. This figure, by the way,
exceeds the total overseas indebted-
ness at the close of 1966.

ment in 1953/54 averaged a 22.8 per-
cent return, and the return averaged
about 16 percent for the whole of the
19505. However, it’s back to about
seven or eight percent now, which is
nothing exciting.
There was also the thought that U.S.
investment was growing too quickly.
President Johnson silenced that criti-
cism with his voluntary restraints and
interest equalisation taxes. Fortunately
for a great deal of our development,
some corporations, had, with foresight,
made advance arrangements for funds,
and these commitments have been hon-
ored. So far inflow has continued up-
wards: 1963/64, $193 million; 1964/65,
$234 million; and 1965/66, $305 mil-
lion.
This rate of growth, surely, must
soon, however, taper off. The current
situation is that it is difficult for an
Australian enterprise to attract sub-
stantial investment from America
today. Money is tight. This doesn’t
mean it is unavailable, but a new ven-
ture would need to be an extremely
attractive proposition to be assured it
would qualify for funds from within
the U.S.A.
Australia must now face the fact that
while existing U.S.-controlled com-
panies in Australia will continue to
plough back funds and even find some
new U.S. dollars to invest, and some
new companies or ventures will attract
new capital, U.S. dollars are not avail-
able to Australia as readily as they
used to be, for the present at any
rate. So Australia should realise that it
can now purchase the components as
well as the package.
Some cognisance must be taken of
the extent to which overseas control
of Australia’s industry has grown in
recent years. The Department of Trade
in its publication “Overseas Investment
in Australian Industry, 1966,” assessed
total manufacturing assets controlled
(and I stress controlled) by overseas
companies at $4.7 billion (U.S.-
controlled $1.87 billion). Unfortun-
ately, no figure is given for all manu-
facturing industry, but other statistics,
although not directly comparable, indi-
cate the proportion could be high.
In this connection I am inclined to
question the assumption that if we are
to welcome more overseas capital we
prefer to see it go into industries
which will either replace imports or
create exports. In the end result I
admit we must see some credits arising
in our balance of payments accounts to
compensate for the debits which arise
when profits start to flow back over-
seas. Perhaps, however, we should learn
to be clever enough to achieve this
result indirectly by welcoming more
U.S. investment into domestic industry

and encouraging more Australian in-
vestment in heavy and other industry.
Assuming the more advanced indus-
tries can attract the funds released by
such a process - and the Resources
Development Bank is one way of help-
ing us to do this Australians may be
able to purchase many of the other
components they need to prosper in
areas of more advanced technologies.
~We should bear in mind that U.S. in-
vestment is present in Australia, not
only j n t h e f orm D f manufacturing
industry and funds for mining ventures,
but also a ? finanaial and specialist ser-
ylcfs whlch caa be availed of by Aus ‘
‘ r ? han , as well a , s overseas groups
These lat,er are what I mean when I
say we can P urchase the components.
, The components I have in mind—we
might almost refer to these as the new
source of U.S. investment are the
means readily available for acquiring
access to the advanced techniques in
international financing, in administra-
tion, market surveys, engineering pro-
cesses and design, product design, ad-
vertising, and so on, which have pre-
viously been brought to this country
by manufacturing companies for use
within their own businesses. Top-line
financiers, consultants, and research
establishments, having followed their
clients here from the U.S., have estab-
lished themselves in Australia, and are
thus ideally placed to adjust overseas
techniques to Australian conditions.
Many of the advanced management,
financing, and marketing techniques are
evolved under the sheer pressures of
necessity which arise in the large over-
seas corporations and the major centres
of world trade. Australia is favored, of
course, in having in its cities people
who can advise and interpret such
knowledge, not only from the U.S., but
from Britain also, and from Australian
firms who have themselves acted as
receiving houses for overseas know-how.
However, the one factor above all
others which will both allow Australians
to fill top management positions in the
overseas-controlled businesses resident
here, and to retain a reasonable balance
of control by developing existing Aus-
tralian-controlled industry and creating
new units, will be the growth of
adequate education for businessmen.
I fully appreciate, however, there are
many areas where experience just can-
not be purchased and also that suf-
ficient cash cannot be attracted here in
this manner. This is why I said at the
outset that Australia should purchase
the components as well as the package.
Thirdly, and finally, Australia should
foster an environment which encour-
ages the best use of investment. It is
easy when we talk of optimising the use
of investment to think of all sorts of
complicated schemes designed to ensure
that the right sector is developed and
the desired result achieved. These may
be necessary if a vigorous and confident
attitude toward solving the problems
of growth had not already developed;
and acceptable if the inventiveness and
adaptability shown under systems giving
freer reign to individual enterprise
could be maintained, which, to say the
least, is doubtful.
Some permissive controls and guide-
lines are helpful —we have them
already and they could no doubt be im-
proved to the benefit of investors as
well as the nation. The ideas of the
Tariff Board, for instance, may provide
useful indications of where investment
may become unattractive unless it can
do much better than at present. A
wisely applied Trade Practices Act
could prove beneficial. Guidance can
also be expected from fiscal and mone-
tary policy. I am sure that present and
would-be U.S. investors, as well as
other companies operative in Australia
and hoping to come here, all welcome
reliable information which allows them
to recognise which investments are in
the best national interest. Investments
directed to meet the national interest
provide the soundest long-term oppor-
tunities.

Some thoughts from
a blue-blood
insurance man
BY J. C. HORSFALL
Come all ye generous husbands with
your wives,
Insure round sums on your precarious
lives,
That, to your comfort, when you’re dead
and rotten,
Your widows may be rich when you’re
forgotten.
IN MY EXPERIENCE the trouble
with all grand insurance occasions, such
as the one in Melbourne last week
when Legal and General opened its
spanking new office block, which it
shares with its old next-door neighbor
J. B. Were and Son and associated
Capel Court companies at 379 Collins
Street, is the feeling of foreboding one
gets at them. They reek with an
atmosphere of fatality as if tailor-made
for pre-determinists. Those who refuse
to meet events half way, let alone pre-
pare for all contingencies (as you can
with L and G and most other giants
in the insurance business here), should
avoid them.
It wasn’t just that there were so
many inscrutable faces, all seemingly
looking into the souls of outsiders in
the gathering and divining the uneasy
thoughts of those who somewhere along
the line had passed up an opportunity
to take out a policy, say for fire insur-
ance, only to have found their houses
go up in flames. Nor was it simply that
here was another skyscraper built,
maybe, as it is said the Pru’s in Lon-
don was, on the proceeds of forfeited
policies (one wouldn’t know about
that), to match the best of the other
innumerable castles put up by such
concerns in the capital cities of Aus-
tralia in recent times (is there no end
to it?). Indeed, the building could as
easily have belonged to an oil company,
a bank, or a government.
No, the most disarming and awe-
some aspect of last week’s show, as it
struck me, was the Irish fatalism of
56-year-old Mr. Patrick Cahill, general
manager of the group (the second-
biggest of its kind in the world), who
had come specially from London for
it, carrying with him all the kudos
associated with the office of present
chairman of the British Insurance
Association. With such blue insurance
blood in his veins, it was perhaps to be
expected that Mr. Cahill would regard
even such a dire event as devaluation
as something that could be insured
against. He was at pains at his Press
conference to underline the point that
the group’s operations in each of the
many countries in which it does busi-
ness contrives to balance their assets
and liabilities independent of the parent
company in Britain and would not in
themselves be affected to any great
extent one way or the other by devalu-
ation. However, British insurance com-
panies have recently been suffering
losses on non-life business in the U.S.,
and devaluation would have a net
adverse effect on that account.
Nonetheless, Mr. Cahill was not all
that perturbed by devaluation, which
apparently caught him on the hop.
He hadn’t reckoned it an imminent
possibility when he’d departed for these
shores a few weeks ago. He admitted
to its unsettling effect on Britain’s
economy and on the prospect for end-
ing Britain’s curbs on the export of
capital, but appeared quite sanguine
about its effects on the insurance in-
dustry. It has long been proved a fal-
lacy that currency depreciation mili-
tates against new insurance business,
and, although he didn’t say so, it has a
salutary effect on the payment of future
claims in that it lightens their burden
to the companies. It is true, of course,
that current claims are met in currency
of the same purchasing power as that
with which current premiums are paid.
But the value in purchasing-power
terms of current and future payments
of claims is inevitably less than the
value of the money in which the
premiums were paid in the past. This is
not necessarily an argument against
buying life insurance, yet it certainly
supports the theory that it is better to
be a shareholder than a policyholder in
a life company.
How imminent did he think the
advent of nationalisation of life in-
surance? He thought not very, even
in Britain, because, as he saw it,
Britain would take some time to re-
gain its economic strength sufficiently
for the Government to implement
anything it had been cooking up in that
direction. He said the Wilson Govern-
ment is drawing up a 15-to-20-year
plan outlining its views on this sub-
ject. In the interim, Mr. Cahill said,
there would be ample scope for the
life companies to expand their business
in the field of superannuation, especi-
ally for medium- and high-income
levels. He thought that the gradual
introduction of national insurance
would not interfere with the expansion
of this type of business. He saw the
same avenues of expansion open for it
in Australia. On the question of
portability of pensions, he explained
that this idea was gaining ground in
Britain more than in any other
country. He personally was entirely in
favor of such pensions on the ground
that pensions were in effect deferred
pay and an employee should be able
to transfer his rights from job to job.
However, he had found that many
employers were not in agreement.
Mr. Cahill, like L and G itself,,
appears to have a Forsyte’s enthusiasm
for investment in real property, which
one, on his showing, would expect to
see an expanding feature of L and G’s
investments. He thinks there’s a big
future here for lease-back property
deals in which insurance companies
finance, as owners, new buildings which
they lease to big companies a highly
developed practice in Britain. The
beauty of such an arrangement is that
it frees the funds of trading and manu-
facturing concerns from being locked
up in buildings, the fixed investment in
which is a more appropriate function
of long-term savings and thus can be
done more usefully by life companies.
Asked whether the ultimate effect of
this, say, in Britain, would be for the
Pru, Legal and General, and Norwich
to finish up by owning half the build-
ings in the country, Mr. Cahill didn’t
rate this a very serious possibility. For
one thing, he said, there were any
Patrick Cahill... fatalistic
number of small property companies
engaged in the same sort of activity.
Neither Mr. Cahill nor L and G’s
manager and actuary in Australia,
Oxfordian R. H. Peet (down from
Sydney for the opening), were all that
articulate at the Press conference about
the group’s intentions on investment in
development projects, mining for ex-
ample, in Australia. But they made it
clear that, because its life business has
progressed so well since it was started
in 1956 (it now ranks sixth for such
business among the life companies
operating in Australia, having, at the
end of 1966, $5OO million in sums
assured and a statutary fund of $47
million, which is presently increasing
at the impressive rate of more than
$lO million a year), the company was
getting into position to make a more
solid contribution. Let us hope the com-
pany’s present obsession for real
property doesn’t hold this up too long.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
One of the best:
the eighth
annual report
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: It is
with considerable satisfaction that this
eighth annual report and accounts
covering the twelve months ended
November 30, 1967, are laid before
you. As has been our practice in the
past, every effort has been made to
present these accounts as quickly as
possible. In this regard we are proud
of our record both for this year and
for previous years.
PROFIT: Directors are pleased to
report a profit of $5097. This repre-
sents an earning rate of 72 percent on
funds employed at the beginning of
the period and is the second highest
earning rate ever achieved by the port-
folio. However, as pointed out only
two weeks ago, it has been one of the
best years ever enjoyed by investors
and, other than shorting the market,
it has been a particularly difficult one
in which not to make profits. By the
same token, most of the large profits
have been in the base-metal sector,
whereas the portfolio has, for reasons
outlined in the Trading Review, con-
centrated the bulk of its efforts in the
relatively less exciting though never-
theless buoyant industrial market. The
history of growth of the diary since it
began eight years ago is shown in the
tables. An amount of $4OOO was the
original base in 1960. However, when
the value of the portfolio had grown
to $27,210 in 1964, the $23,210 profit
was taken out for living expenses and
the base was again reduced to $4OOO.
If this adjustment had not been made,
the portfolio would now stand at
$35,437, an increase of almost 900
percent. The portfolio is now up to
$12,227 and the aim is to again reach
$27,000 before the end of the decade.
Chances are figured at 50/50.
TRADING REVIEW: The most
obvious force about the market in the
past twelve months has been the fan-
tastic bonanza in the mining sector.
However, even as I write, there is, and
has been for the past few days, a very
marked easing right across the board
in this division. This is particularly
significant when it is remembered that
this time of the year (i.e., the last
few weeks before Christmas) is a
traditionally bullish one.
Now for the policy followed during
the year. As mentioned previously,
most of the year’s effort was concen-
trated in the industrial rather than in
the mining division of operations. The
reason for this was simple. As almost
every newspaper, every magazine, and
every broker’s letter sighted since
March this year has been singing the
praises of the miners, it was merely
thought that a change of diet would
be stimulating. It is not that the min-
ing market was not thought to be a
good one. It was. The profits made
from Hamersley (the biggest of the
year), Amalgamated Petroleum, and
Thiess substantiate this. It was con-
sidered, however, that many of the
mining prices were and still are much
too heavily based on the prospect of
future profits (and hopes) rather than
on the immediate outlook. Another
reason for dallying in the industrials,
other than the main one previously
mentioned, was that with all the best
brains being concentrated on the
miners, many good industrial situations
were taking an abnormally long time
to be spotted and acted upon. Bowling
Centres Holdings and Jaywoth were
two companies where the portfolio was
able to benefit from this very situation.
MARKET OUTLOOK: Despite
the current and un-Christmassy price
reaction being experienced by the
mining market, the natural resources
stocks still look the best bet for the
future. Indeed, the expected rise in
mineral exports from a current $384
million to $829 million over the next
five years indicates a pace that will
be nigh on impossible for the industrials
to match. As always, Australian in-
dustry is faced with the problems of
ever-rising costs, small markets, and,
in this year, particularly, high level of
industrial unrest. So all in all it looks-
as though the miners are far from
having had their day (particularly the
soundly based ones) and again present
the best opportunities for the new year.
CONCLUSION: It has generally
been an exciting year and the direc-
tors hope that the next twelve months
will be on a par. On some occasions
it may appear that purchases and sales
have been made at bargain levels. How-
ever, it must be remembered that the
diary relates to transactions recorded
during the previous week. Directors
look forward to another eventful year.

What comes after the gold rush?
1. How dollars and sterling
are faring
THE IMMEDIATE ATTACK on the
dollar was beaten off impressively
quickly, but the “Economist’s” special
correspondent in Washington says that
longer-term worries continue. How are
things going for the world’s two major
trading currencies, dollars and sterling,
now that the immediate post-devalua-
tion hysteria has died down? The
“Economist” reports:
The speculators retreated as the
world learned what staggering resources
were being put into the front line for
the dollar and sterling. American and
European bankers’ determination to
keep the gold price at $35 an ounce,
the smooth approval of the Interna-
tional Monetary Fund to a British
credit line of $1.4 billion (on top of
the equally large borrowing Britain has
negotiated with central banks), the
rumors of a huge new network of credit
arrangements between the central
banks, the appointment of a new Chan-
cellor to run British economic policy
—all of these helped to bolster confid-
ence. By last Thursday, it was possible
to believe that the unsettling effects of
the sterling devaluation were behind
us. Indeed, American and European
bankers were congratulating each other
on the way it had gone off. The pessi-
mists still harbored two doubts: first,
the longer-term control of the dollar,
gold, and whole world monetary system,
with which M. Debre made full play
when he spoke at the opening on
Thursday of the two-day ministerial
meeting of the Organisation for Econo-
mic Co-operation and Development;
and, secondly, on the ability of British
economic management to make the
most of the opportunities from devalua-
tion.
On the first doubt, the declaration
of solidarity by the seven remaining
members of the gold pool (America,
Britain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland,
the Netherlands, and Belgium) was
organised by the American authorities,
who had taken the initiative in calling
the sudden and dramatic meeting at
Frankfurt which issued it. The declar-
ation was enough, by itself, to stop the
rush out of dollars into gold, despite
President de Gaulle’s thunderbolts the
following day, and despite the fact that
the full import of the central banks’
action was not made at all clear in
the brief official communique. On
Monday, demand at the daily gold fix-
ing in London dropped to 20 tons from
the previous Friday’s horrendous 85
tons; and by Tuesday and Wednesday
of last week it was practically back at
the normal 6to 7 tons a day. More-
over, the dollar, which had required
support against most leading European
currencies in the week following Brit-
ain’s devaluation, was back above the
intervention point against all European
currencies last week.
The dollar’s recovery might have
been still more impressive had the mar-
kets known (a) the full implications of
the gold pool members’ declaration;
and (b) about the substantial additional
central banking facilities the Federal
Reserve had been arranging. Additions
have been made to the credit lines
between the New York Federal Reserve
Bank and most of the central banks
with which such facilities already exist,
not just the members of the gold pool.
And gold pool members at Frank-
furt did not merely commit themselves,
as in the past, for strictly limited
periods and strictly limited sums; they
have considerably enlarged the size of
their commitments as well as the period
for which these commitments have been
made.
What about the longer-term prospects
for the American balance of payments?
American officials claim that the recent
tightening of the “voluntary” restraints
on foreign American direct investment
and lending should reduce the deficit
on private capital flows by $0.25 to
$0.5 billion a year. A further tightening
of these controls is being planned now;
and this, it is officially said, should
ensure a total reduction of this outflow
of up to $O.l billion a year. But it is
no good pretending that anybody in
Washington is expecting anything
approaching a speedy elimination of
America’s persistent external deficit or
even its elimination. More hopes are
being pitched on the possibility that
additional countries will join Germany
and Japan in their formal undertak-
ings, and Italy in its informal practice,
of not cashing in dollars for gold.
What happens if enough other central
banks do not observe such restraint?
Although chairman Martin of the
Federal Reserve System has said pub-
licly that he would be prepared to
sell the last ingot of America’s gold
stock (now just under sl3 billion),
other commentators believe that
America would choose to shut the
gold window long before that stage
was reached. If it did, one guess is
that the London gold price might
shoot up, say, to S6O an ounce. Foreign
central banks would then presumably
also refuse to buy or sell gold in a
rising market, but the speculators
assume that they would not be willing
to see either the disappearance of their
reserve asset or its devaluation. What
some of them would probably do, it
is suggested, is to reconsider their
parities against the dollar in a new
situation. Professor Samuelson has
written this past week that “if some
years from now the dollar were de-
valued by 10 to 20 percent the world
would not have come to an end —
America might be better off.” But not
many people are prepared to agree
with him.
On the second “doubt,” the quality
of Britain’s economic management de-
valued Britain spent last week fixing
up its new loans. In Paris the financial
experts of the Group of Ten industrial
countries agreed to provide supple-
mentary currencies to the tune of SSOO
million under the General Arrange-
ments to Borrow, in order to allow the
International Monetary Fund to make
up Britain’s stand-by credit of $1.4
billion. (If Britain were to activate
this drawing, the funds would consist
of S4OO million from IMF sales of
gold, SSOO million from the IMF’s
own currency holdings, and the remain-
ing SSOO million through the General
Arrangements to Borrow). But
although, on the face of it, all went
very smoothly last Wednesday and
immediately after the Paris decision the
IMF directors in Washington formally
approved the credit facilities behind
the scenes some pretty forcible inter-
national doubts were being expressed
about the adequacy of Britain’s eco-
nomic program.
To some extent it seems the trouble
in Paris was a matter of the French
getting bossy; they recalled somewhat
bitterly the grilling France had to take
when it devalued nine years ago. A lot
is being made of the fact that the
IMF has been promised that the
Exchequer borrowing next year should
not be more than £IOOO million; but,
on the evidence available so far, it is
not at all clear what this means. The
size of the deficit on Britain’s overall
'budget accounts automatically goes-
down in a year when prices and
incomes are inflating, and presumably
this is not what the IMF wants to
happen. It is certainly the exact
opposite of the main real cause of
concern among sophisticated European
and American observers. Their worry
is whether Britain will contain wage
increases sufficiently, or whether these
will be of such a size as to undo much
of the good of devaluation. Alarm-
ingly, expectations of 5 or 6 percent
rises in money Mages in the year ahead


seem to be accepted quite calmly in
Whitehall. Britain’s foreign creditors
are also disturbed to hear the grum-
bling expectation of British indus-
trialists that the Government is likely
to keep a sterner watchdog control
over prices and wages. Mr. Jenkins’
first job should be to assure the world
that it will not.
Confidence about Britain’s own pros-
pects has not been improved by the
•cloud of mystery that hangs around the
various reports that have been made
on Britain’s prospects. The OECD
evidently believes devaluation could
mean a gain of nine to ten percent in
margins for British exporters, a bit
more than the Treasury itself appears
to be expecting; but it seems so un-
certain as to how the internal economy
will move that it thinks the British
Government might have to do some-
thing more in the future “in either dir-
ection.”
Nor did Britain’s “letter of intent”
to the IMF, made public last Thursday,
give much enlightenment to anybody
about what economic targets Britain
fiopes to hit in the year ahead ex-
cept that the Government expects that
Britain’s balance of payments surplus
in the second half of 1968 should reach
an annual rate of at least s2ooom.
Apart from that, and from such mysti-
fying remarks as that about next year’s
hoped-for limit of $ 1000 m. to Ex-
chequer borrowing, the letter relies
mainly on the vaguest sort of arithmetic
in hoping that room will be made for
transferring £7som. to £Boom. a year
•of new resources toward the balance of
payments.
The letter gives the impression of
ducking many of the issues until next
February, when the Treasury is due to
carry outfits normal (and usually secret)
review of Britain’s economic prospects
ahead; somewhat lugubriously, the
British Government says it “will be
happy” to consult further with M.
Schweitzer, the IMF’s managing dir-
ector, after that review, and “after
the further reviews planned for July
and November, 1968.”
2. How the
speculators
are doing
THE GOLD RUSH is well and truly
over. Last week Australian gold-
mining shares collapsed after what
The Bullettin has described as “the
absurd rush into gold stocks” ended
with strong evidence of international
determination to hold the price of gold
steady at $U.5.35 an ounce. The falls
in Australian gold miners were sensa-
tional: Emperor from $1.20 to 67
cents, GMK from $2.45 to $1.40, Hill
50 from 98 cents to 62 cents, Lake
View and Star from $4.90 to $2.90,
New Guinea Gold from 73 to 58
cents, Central Norseman from $6.80
to $4.20, Planet Gold from 53 cents
to 36 cents, Southern Kinta from $4.19
to $3.21, and even Western Mining
from $31.20 to $27.30.
Australian markets had not been
alone in their gold mania. In London,
the gold share market, scene of so
many soaring hopes and dashed illu-
sions, has once again burnt a good
many fingers. It is impossible to say
who will have the last laugh, but
buyers during the week following de-
valuation, unless they got in early, had
a nasty surprise. In that first hectic
week, the “Financial Times” gold
mines index rose 24 percent. In the
following four days’ business, the
advance was cut to ten percent. The
market reacted severely last week when
the remaining members of the gold
pool rallied round, and some com-
mentators wonder whether the fall
might not have been overdone.
Has it? Is there a chance of an
increase in the price of gold? Has
the pressure on dollars caused by
Britain’s devaluation really been over-
come?
The first really serious rebuff to
the gold speculators emerged from the
meeting of central bank governors in
Frankfurt the Sunday before last. All
seven active members of the gold pool
were represented. France, having
withdrawn from the pool (and having
let it be known with such disastrous
effects on the world gold market the
previous week), was not invited.
French officials make no secret of
how disagreeable it was to see the
Five closeted with the Americans and
the British in France’s absence, and
with an intent obviously contrary to
French policy. The international
bankers insisted on holding the gold
price steady and the IMF handed out
another $U.5.1.4 billion loan to Britain
on top of equally large loans from
other central banks.
Even though the gold rush of last
week has largely subsided, the French,
the leaders of the gold “push,” still
believe that a strong demand for gold
will continue into the months ahead.
But the French will be out of the gold
pool and suspect that from now on
even greater secrecy will surround its
operations (which will not be exposed
to French leaks). According to the
“Economist,” officials in Paris do not
believe there is a serious possibility of
gold being demonetised and are cer-
tain that any American embargo on
gold sales would be bound to cause
the price of gold to rise. But the
French are not at all pleased at the
willingness of their common market
partners and other countries to ease
the dollar’s difficulties.
The Bank of France now holds
something like a billion dollars, but
about half of this probably represents
a hot-money inflow over the past few
weeks. It would certainly be unwise
for the French Government, if it should
feel so inclined, to throw these dollars
into the gold market. In any case,
the feeling in Paris now is that the
dollar is sufficiently strong to stand up
to a sudden attack of this kind.
France is, therefore, taking a longer
view of its strategy and sees the success
or failure of Britain’s devaluation as the
key question. If it were to fail, the
dollar could hardly stand a second de-
valuation of the pound, which would
certainly have wider repercussions on
the exchange rate structure than the
first. If the devaluation is a success it
will be only at the price of severe
deflation in Britain. The defence of the
dollar and of the pound’s new parity
will certainly be a deflationary influ-
ence in world trade next year. But a
weak world demand for French exports
is the last thing the French economy-
needs next year. It might even make
the franc look just a tiny bit shaky.
The U.S. gold-stock situation is not
nearly as serious as speculators had
hoped. About $lO billion of America’s
gold reserve is tied up at present as
cover for Federal Reserve notes, and is
not, therefore, automatically available
to be exchanged at the price of $35 an
ounce against dollars presented to the
United States Treasury by foreign
official holders. But, in fact, the hurdle
can be surmounted fairly easily.
At present, America’s gold reserves
amount to just under $l3 billion, down
from well over $2O billion a decade ago.
Some $lO billion of this gold is tied up
as cover for approximately $4O billion
of currency in circulation in the form
of Federal Reserve notes. Under the
Federal Reserve Act the central bank
must maintain not less than 25 percent
of gold against Federal Reserve notes
in actual circulation. Thus the United
States has at this moment only just
under $3 billion of gold immediately
available to foreign central banks want-
ing to cash dollars.
The “clean” way around this is a Bill
to scrap the gold cover provision. It had
been realised for some time that the
growth in the necessary supply of cur-
rency and in the legitimate demands for
gold for industrial and other uses
would necessitate the abolition of the
gold cover in a few years’ time. There
is already a Bill to do this before Con-
gress, but the Administration has said
that it will wait until next year before
pressing Congress to pass it: according
to Government spokesmen Congress is
now “disposed to do it” and there should
be no difficulty.
But in case there is, there is also an
“unclean” way of getting i-ound the
provision by simply issuing Federal
Reserve notes without cover and paying
a small “fine” for doing so. The amount
increases with the deficiency, but even
if the gold cover were ignoret entirely
the “fine” would amount to only $4O
million a year. That would be small
compared with the $1.6 billion that
the central bank paid to the Treasury
last year as a regular remittance on its
earnings. So no one seems particularly
worried at the prospect of such a fine—
and, anyway, it does not now look as
if it will have to be paid.


WILD CAT PAGES
Tactics for a new situation
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
THE WILD PART of the mining boom
is definitely dead, and good riddance.
Great Boulder directors probably did
the stockmarket a service when they
came out with their gloomy drilling
reports and whacking great premium
on their new share issue. Now the
market can settle down to some serious
investing based more on probabilities
and less on what Jack said in the
corner pub.
The speculators (and the chartists)
are taking some comfort from the fact
that turnovers were well down in last
week’s market slide, indicating, to
them, that maybe the boom had not
really ended after all and that it only
needed a bit of buying to cheer the
place up again. But the buying won’t
be coming from the amateurs for a
while; most are too busy licking their
wounds. Yet there is no doubt that
most of the big falls did take place on
moderate turnovers; it makes you won-
der what sort of a drop would come if
selling pressure got strong.
Those who stood out against the
trend to lower turnovers were Great
Boulder, whose turnover doubled from
the previous week, and Peko, where
special takeover considerations have in-
fluenced the market. WMC’s turnover
was cut in half as its price fell $2.70.
What are the tactics for the new situ-
ation, now that the share price index
has dropped by a sudden eight percent
(and mining and oil shares have been
slashed by a far greater proportion
than that)? There could be some excel-
lent pickings in good-quality stocks that
have naturally been rocked by the
ripples when little rock hit the mining
pool. Of course the gold boom stocks all
are as dead as a dodo, but BHP looks
excellent value, and so does Thiess. And
Western Mining still has plenty of ap-
peal at its new reduced price, as has
CRA. There are plenty of industrial
stocks that are sound buying at present,
too, as the mining disappointment has
brought a psychological shock to the
whole market. For, despite the prospect
of tighter liquidity next year (and a
swag of new share issues), the business
outlook is good.
Nevertheless, it would only take a
report from one of the very interesting
off-shore oil wells now going down at
Ashmore reef and off the Queensland
coast to put some of the ebbing life
back into the oil market.
What are the professional advisers
telling their clients now? Cowan Invest-
ment Service, which has been a great
fan of Great Boulder, even up at levels
over $lO, is recommending its clients
to “average down” their cost of holding
on by buying at the current low prices
and to attempt to trade their holdings
on the rises and falls that must inevit-
ably follow last week’s crash. It also
suggests that clients should “average
down” their cost of holding EZ Indus-
tries, another disappointing nickel
searcher. But its main suggestion is
that buying opportunities of particular
significance will occur in the next
month or so, and that any gains left
from the speculative performers should
be switched into the leaders of the
long-term boom in natural resources
(the service points out that these have
all been affected by the shakeout but
that they all have estimable prospects).
It sees Ampol as a good buy through
the rights, and it recommends as
bbuys” in the short-term BHP, Ham-
ersley, Myer, New Broken Hill, WMC,
Peko, Westralian Oil, and Mt. Isa
Mines. For the medium-term, it sug-
gests Associated Minerals, Braemar,
Kathleen Investments, and Mary Kath-
leen.
Graeme Moir, the solid supporter of
WMC and BHP all the way up,
through his Moir’s Investment Service
takes the view that despite the easing
in prices “stocks of the calibre of
WMC, BHP, and RTZ will leave run-
of-the-mill industrials well behind over
the next five years.” For BHP, he ex-
pects that favorable buying opportuni-
ties may come available and that as
long as BHP-Esso is able to produce
positive oil-gas drilling results, the
shares can only head in one direction.
And there is some prospect of it getting
success in nickel. But his major en-
thusiasm is reserved for WMC and
RTZ. He says that WMC is a stock
that investors cannot afford to be out
of, and he expects a good advance be-
ing recorded from present levels over
the next six to 12 months. RTZ he re-
gards as one of the best natural-
resource situations that can be bought.
NEITHER DEVALUATION nor last
week’s collapse of the nickel boom has
dampened the enthusiasm of the heavy
buyer of six-month-call options on BHP.
In devaluation week, he bought a
further 9000 six-month calls costing
more than $20,000; last week he added
another 15,000 at a cost of about
$35,000. So since Melbourne Cup Day,
November 7, he has spent a fantastic
$130,000 buying options on 55,000 BHP
shares worth about $BOO,OOO at current
prices in the hope that BHP will rise
by at least $3 a share within six
months. And since most of these were
taken out when BHP was nearer $l7
than $l4, he will need their price to
rise to at least $20.50 before he begins
to make a profit. Things are not run-
ning his way at the moment!
The Chartist says:
NEW GUINEA GOLDFIELDS has been a profitable and interesting technical
performer for investors for some years now. A high of 70c was achieved in 1966,
which satisfied the base projection and after which the steep 200 percent inter-
mediate uptrend broke and a period of consolidation has since followed above the
43c level. The recent rise to 78c on very heavy volume suggests that an uptrend
could be about to be resumed although a severe reaction back to 58c has since
followed. Targets of 90c and approximately $1.35 for the longer term are indica-
tion by the base consolidation. Last sale price on November 30, 1967 —58 c.

The Melbourne market
Mining, mining—the wrong way
ONCE AGAIN IT WAS mining, min-
ing, all the way in Melbourne market
last week. But it was so much the
wrong way and so many speculators
were crying over the losses they were
taking in Great Boulder (which got
down to $5.80 at one time on Friday
after being up to $13.00 the week be-
fore) that the echoes of Mr. Holt’s
optimistic economic prognostications
fell on deafened ears and hardly a
cheer could be heard for industrials.
In the cheerless atmosphere, some
brokers were having second thoughts
about the prospects for the economy
following the decision to keep the
dollar where it was and were even
saying that imports competition from
the devalued countries, especially
Britain, would upset the expansionist
plans in a number of industrial sectors
here.
Against this the Government’s in-
tentions further to subsidise and other-
wise help export interests hit by sterl-
ing devaluation would keep upward
price movements on their course,
something underlined by the whopping
increase in the domestic price of wheat,
and provide a useful buffer for equity
investment. Nobody was actually say-
ing that this situation had all the
ingredients for an ultimate devaluation
of our own currency in the interests of
self-defence, but a few were whispering.
News from industry has dried up
approaching the holiday season, but
that pertaining to a few old situations,
such as Cox Finance and Stanley Kor-
man’s little (now) lot kept a few blush-
ing, especially in establishment circles
where the Wilana affair proved to be
a real boomerang—its hit being all the
more poignant in that the lost funds
involved were the original fodder with
which lan Potter and Co. won the
1960 battle with Were’s which gave
Georges to Sir Frank Richardson. The
only wound that’s healed along Collins
Street in these directions is that
Georges has resumed (under entirely
new colors) in the stock exchange lists
and after coming on the market at
around $1 is holding its own pretty
well at a cent or two under that figure.
The establishment was much more
worried about what may now happen
after the Cox Finance investigation
than on what the Attorney-General may
do as a result of Mr. Peter Murphy’s
final stabs in the lifeless corpses of the
Korman companies, only one of which,
Factors, commands a place, admittedly
a very lowly one, on the local ex-
change’s lists. The latter showed no
particular reaction to the final chap-
ters in Mr. Murphy’s casebook and
stayed around the 17 cent level they’ve
drifted to following the latest indiffe-
rent results from the company’s main
and practically only present operation,
Holeproof New Zealand, which inci-
dentally could do a whole lot better as
a result of N.Z.’s big devaluation. It
could invade the Australian market, for
instance, armed with a marvellous-
price advantage, unless the Tariff
Board takes countervailing action.
(Talking about the possible effects of
future competition from imports on the
local textile industry with Fibremakers
last week, the company pointed out that
in its case it had recently (Nov. 13)
substantially cut its price of continuous
filament apparel yarns, so at least one
leading local textiles firm is alive to the
possibilities of such competition de-
veloping and, of course, as supplier of
yarns to other firms in the industry this
will have a cumulative effect.)
Probably Factors shares are well
worth their present value in the market
on the strength of Holeproof New
Zealand assets and enhanced prospects,
though an interesting situation could
arise if the big wad of these shares
revealed by Mr. Murphy to be still
held by the Korman private companies
he castigated so roundly for milking
the public ones. It is unlikely that the
two private companies, Stanhill and
Park Lake, are holding any less Factors
shares than they did when Mr. Murphy
last counted them on June 30, 1965,
though one has no precise information
on this.
ELABORATING ON HIS earlier
post-devaluation statement at the an-
nual meeting of Felt & Textiles here
on Friday, Sir Robert Webster ex-
pressed confidence that the increased
profitability of the group’s Australian
operations would offset the reduction in
the New Zealand subsidiary’s share of
profits at the latter’s depreciated rate
of exchange. But after going to 62,
following the latest encouraging result,
Felts have been a relatively poor mar-
ket. Since the currency changes these
shares have gone back perilously close
to their par 50 cents (but still above
it). Thus far there has been little reac-
tion to Sir Robert’s assurances, even
though they were supported by a fore-
cast of more exciting things happening
for the group in the plastic field follow-
ing its announcement last August of a $1
million expansion program in this field,
which is expected to be yielding profits
next year. However, although Sir Rob-
ert said that both profits in Australia
and also for the group as a whole, along
with sales (excluding the value of wool
turnover) in the first four months this
year were ahead of those for the same
period last year, the market would
appear to be content to wait for to see
how the new exchange lineup works
out in practice before following Sir
Robert’s lead.

Behind the balance sheets
BMI: heavyweight changes class
IF BLUE METAL INDUSTRIES
cannot come up with a much improved
result this year (and the chances are
it will), it may as well forget about its
old “growth stock” image. Its trading
profits from its own exertions have
steadily fallen since 1964 by a total of
37 percent; its desperate attempt to
plug up the profit hole by acquiring a
half-stake in Ready Mixed Concrete
has resulted in its paying too much for
what some of its critics say is too
little.
Each year there has been a good
excuse for a bad result: losses on big
contracts, special once-and-for-all situ-
ations, legal claims. But the fact re-
mains that BMl’s assets have been
steadily building up (largely through
acquisition) while its profits have been
steadily going down. By now, the mar-
ket has every right to question whether
the compainy’s management will be able
to reverse this trend; whether it can
ever hope to see BMI earning 12% per-
cent on the funds employed in the busi-
ness, as in 1964, instead of the 5.6
percent of last year. For BMl’s mod-
erate fall in earning rate from 25.8
percent to only 21.4 percent over this
period does not reflect the company’s
falling basic profitability on the re-
sources it employs; the use of a large
share premium in its RMC takeover
(which unfortunate former RMC share-
holders saw cut in half when the reali-
ties of BMl’s poor profit performance
eventually hit the market) reduced the
cost in capital terms that BMI had to
pay-
But the prospects are that BMI may
at last be emerging from this period
of unimpressive performances. And
that, unless it makes any more serious
mistakes (if it has been bad luck,
surely the run must end; if it has been
bad management, surely something has
been done about it), then there is a
real chance that BMl’s profits could get
back over 25 percent on capital quite
shortly. Certainly, it has everything
running for it this year; building
activity has been showing a healthy up-
turn according to the latest official
statistics and the company has only one
of its bad mistakes (the unprofitable
Wollongong Council contract) still
affecting profit. And RMC should also
begin to feel the benefits of its new
bulk-cement deal with Tasmania’s
Goliath Cement.
The RMC deal has drastically altered
the financial situation of BMI. But
there is no doubt that BMI needed
RMC a lot more than RMC (and its
shareholders) needed the ailing BMI.
Without RMC’s profit, there would
have been a collapse in BMl’s latest
earning rate to only 17 percent (on pre-
takeover capital). The 15 percent divi-
dend would not have looked too secure.
Investment income veils the trend of
BMl’s own trading, which has been
down heavily in the past three years.
Net earnings from trading were
$1,833,000 in 1963; $1,916,000 in 1964;
$1,358,000 in 1965; $1,245,000 in 1966;
and $1,203,000 in 1967.
But BMl’s much-needed profit boost
from RMC has been bought at some
cost to BMl’s longer-term financial posi-
tion—unless RMC’s profits rise at an
unlikely rate in coming years. A share-
holder at the recent BMI annual meet-
ing pointed out that if BMPs invest-
ment in RMC were a fraction more
than its half-share, BMl’s net tangible
asset backing per share would be about
$1.12 instead of $1.56 as shown in 1967
group accounts. The $lO million which
BMI and CSR each paid for “goodwill”
to acquire 50-50 interests in RMC
would have to appear as such in a
consolidation. As it is, BMI shows
RMC as an investment of some $24
million. But according to its 1967
accounts, RMC’s net tangible assets
total $27.7 million, so that BMPs $24
million investment in RMC covers
assets of $13.4 million.
The cost in cash and capital was
considerably less, because of BMPs high
share premium at the time. BMPs
share of the consideration was
$4,040,000 in cash and the issue of
$4,187,178 capital. Current yield on
the capital cost of this investment is
still a little below BMPs urgently de-
pressed earnings of 17 percent on its
own operations, and well down on the
average earnings of 28.5 percent on
capital BMI earned from its basic
quarrying and bituminous-mix opera-
tions in the six years before the RMC
acquisition. RMC’s 17 percent earn-
ings on BMI capital is calculated after
deducting an interest bill of $310,000 a
year on the $4 million cash added to
help acquire RMC at BMl’s borrowing
rate of 7f percent.
And there is nothing hidden away
in RMC, for all the profits are distri-
buted in dividends. BMl’s 1967 divi-
dend from RMC was $1,044,000, repre-
senting little better than 4 percent on
the book value of its investment.
Even though BMI and CSR are tak-
ing what they can out of RMC in
dividends (all its profit each year, and
special dividends, too), there seems
some prospect that it will nevertheless
be able to earn increasing profits for
them in the future. RMC business was
blighted by an onerous business con-
tract made in 1960, which was ter-
minated in 1966-67 after payment of
$700,000 to the client, from unappro-
priated profits. Future results should
benefit by its withdrawal. RMC is
drawing large supplies of (bulk cement,
presumably cheaper than available
locally, from Goliath Cement in Tas-
mania under a recent contract to run
for a number of years. Although teeth-
ing troubles were encountered with
transport from Tasmania, BMI is confi-
dent of material benefits.
RMC reported that the building and
construction industry experienced
general lack' of buoyancy for the grea-
ter part of the year to June, 1967, but
there was an improving trend in the
closing stages. BMI chairman Mr. J.
W. Austin said a substantial improve-
ment was expected this year by RMC,
including better profit from the tin
operation in Malaysia. RMC is nation-
wide, giving more spread and stability
to BMI, whose operations are mainly
concentrated in New South Wales.
As for BMI itself, the heavyweight
in the N.S.W. quarrying industry, it has
had a couple of unhappy experiences
with contracts. One, to supply materials
as a sub-contractor for the extension
of Mascot runways, caused losses in
1965 and 1966. These were wholly writ-
ten off against profits as they occurred,
said directors. A claim against the
Commonwealth Department of Works
of well over slm. is currently being
heard. Any settlement will be brought
in as taxable trading profit if and when
received. As production for the con-
tract was completed in November, 1965,
results for the second half of 1965-66
and all of 1966-67 should have picked
up, but group results have not reacted
as would be expected.
Another but lesser depressant was
the losses on the five-year contract with
Wollongong Council, where the price
was trimmed too fine to cover the prob-
lems encountered. Specifications w?re
strictly enforced, and a large amount
of stone rejected. The contract still has
another 18 months to run. A further
trouble spot was the timber division,
which showed losses in 1966 and 1967.
BMI has tied up most of the major
deposits of sand, gravel, and blue metal
and stone in areas close to Sydney and
major N.S.W. markets. This has been
accelerated by numerous takeovers, the
latest of Emu and Prospect Gravel and
Road Metal for $2.4m. cash, financed
internally, in Octover, 1966.
Gross value of properties rose
approximately $| million and of plant
and equipment by $1 million, reflecting
this takeover. But stocks were largely
unchanged at $4.45 million, and trade
debtors net of doubtful debts and allow-
ances actually fell from $4.5 million to
$3.4 million, due to “sadly diminished
sales” in the month of June. The chair-
man said there were 23 wet days in
June in the Sydney metropolitan area,
where operations are concentrated, so
that this downturn did not reflect any
indications that building activity was
slowing down.
Melocco Bros, and Loveridge and
Hudson Pty., subsidiaries supplying and
fixing marble, terrazzo, mosaic, exposed
aggregate, granite, sandstone, sawn and
monumental stone, depend largely on
commercial building activity. In
N.S.W. approvals for commercial and
industrial buildings are healthy enough.


Hotmix and other premixed bitu-
minous materials are supplied from
seven plants round Sydney, for roads,
airports, parking areas, and driveways.
The company is going deeper into
brickmaking. Clark Kilns, which has
plants at Moorebank and Prospect with
capacity of 30 million units a year,
supplying extruded texture bricks to
the Sydney metropolitan area and from
Canberra to Newcastle, is establishing a
new plant at Bringelly, with initial
capacity of 17 million units and plans
to double this as the area develops.
The raising of $2 million by a private
placement of debentures in January,
1966, and $4 million from a debenture
issue to share and debenture holders,
has imposed an interest burden of
$565,000 on 1967 profits, compared with
$169,000 in 1966. Shareholders are
unlikely to be called on for additional
funds in the near future (previous
issues were at par, one-for-three in 1957
and one-for-four in 1961) as directors
feel the company is now in a reason-
ably comfortable cash position, with
current ratio much healthier in the past
two years than the preceding three.
Bank overdraft is almost nil, and
borrowings this year have been re-
arranged to longer-term debts.
The company has some other invest-
ments that are doing fairly well. For
instance, BMl’s income from “other
investments” apart from RMC has had
a striking improvement, almost doubling
from $82,672 in 1965-66 to $160,302 in
the latest year. But BMl’s generally un-
informative annual report gives no hint
what this is all about, even though the
group’s profits would have fallen once
again without it. The company also
fails to report on the sale of its quite
significant holding of listed securities
during the year; these were worth
almost $450,000 in market value at June
30, 1966, although their book value
was only $116,000-odd. The company
will no longer have the income from
these investments, which last year
totalled $25,000, coming in.
The market recognises the change in
BMl’s investment class, while paying
tribute to its high-ranking position in a
basic industry. The lower proportion
of profits retained in the past three
years has affected the company’s longer-
term ability to benefit shareholders, but
there should be improvement in earn-
ings this year, with the possibility of a
windfall from the Mascot claims.

Security analysis
Associated Minerals: a strong
basis of “value”
THESE DAYS IT IS often more inter-
esting to write about a mining company
than an industrial company. The fever
which has attacked a very large num-
ber of the general public has also
managed to intrude itself into at least
one security analyst. The difference is
that the security analyst will almost
certainly always look for some solid
basis for judging a stock and will not
be happy to recommend the purchase
of shares where the company has noth-
ing but the prospects of making some
application for a lease to mine within
100,000 miles of Kambalda.
Associated Minerals Consolidated
Ltd. looks like a mining company
which has a strong basis of “value” and
which has not been caught up in the
speculative fever which has attacked a
number of mining companies over the
past few months. In early August the
shares were selling at $6.34, at which
price they showed a dividend yield of
3.2 percent and were selling at about
20 times the ultimate earnings for
1966/67. Today, about months later,
the last sale took place at $6.80 per
share, which gives a dividend yield of
2.9 percent and represents 22.6 times
1966/67 earnings. While these price/
earnings multiples may look rather high
compared with some of our industrial
stocks today, and the dividend yield
looks fairly sparse, there can be no
doubt that they (dividend yields and
price/earnings multiples) compare ex-
tremely favorably with a number of the
leading mining stocks.
ASSOCIATED MINERALS was
formed in 1953 to acquire an existing
business which had commenced to mine
beach sands in southern Queensland.
Additional leases were obtained from
time to time, both in Queensland and
in northern N.S.W. Since Consolidated
Gold Fields of Australia acquired a 50
percent interest for a cash considera-
tion in 1961, the company has taken
over Z.R. Holdings, Titanium Minerals,
and, most recently, Wyong Minerals.
This latter company was also closely
tied to Consolidated Gold Fields Aus-
tralia, which acquired rather more than
50 percent of the capital at the same
time as it made its acquisition of a
substantial slice of AMC.
It is likely that the combined group,
AMC and Wyong, have some of the
largest reserves of rutile and zircon in
N.S.W. and southern Queensland. The
last annual report suggested that the
combined reserves of the two companies
were about 1.7 million tons of rutile
and, presumably, there is an equivalent
tonnage of zircon. At the present level
of production the leases, with their
known reserves to date, would probably
be sufficient for about 20 years. How-
ever, the company has indicated that
it is now close to raising its output to
100,000 tons each of rutile and zircon
by the end of the current financial year.
A new mining and concentration plant
should be installed and operating at
South Stradbroke Island in January,
1968. This plant is capable of treating
the ore at the rate of 1200 cubic yards
per hour. The Hexham separation plant
has also been increased to its ultimate
capacity of 55,000 tons each of rutile
and zircon per annum. These new addi-
tions to AMC’s productive capacity are
probably part of a plan to concentrate
activities in two main centres. The
relatively small concentrator at Lake
Munmorah, which is not far from the
Hexham plant, will probably be closed
in the future, thus leaving the company
with two main dry concentrating
plants, one at Southport, in southern
Queensland, and the other at Hexham,
near Newcastle.
AS INDICATED, the company should
be able to produce 100,000 tons each
of rutile and zircon in the 1968/69
year, and probably about 90,000 tons in
the current year. It is also likely that
production can be increased further in
the future, but probably not beyond
120,000 tons of each mineral per
annum. The question then becomes
“Can the company sell all the rutile
and zircon which it produces?” There
seems to have been little difficulty over
the past few years because generally
the output of both Associated Minerals
and Wyong Minerals has been sold
forward for a few years. As at June 30,
1967, the company held forward orders
for 440,305 tons of mineral, which was
worth over $29 million. As the com-
pany sold 140,000 tons of rutile ancF
zircon combined during 1966/67, it can
be seen that this figure represents about
three years’ sales.
Rutile has three main uses, the main
use being as a white pigment and sub-
sidiary uses being as a coating for weld-
ing rods, and finally as a metal in space
research. Zircon’s main use is as a
foundry sand, although there are other
uses in ceramics and refractories, etc.
While there would seem to be an ade-
quate world supply of zircon, the reser-
ves of rutile are not very large, outside
of Australia. The largest reserve which
has been discovered in recent years is in
Sierra Leone, where production is ex-
pected to commence in 1967/68, prob-

Ilmenite is a competitor with rutile,
because titanium white pigment can be
made from this mineral, but by what is
commonly known as the “sulphate pro-
cess.” New plants which produce
titanium white pigment are converting
to the “chloride process” and it is ex-
pected that this will be the most likely
method of producing the pigment in
the years ahead. Ultimately, ilmenite
will be upgraded by a process which is
currently only in the production-test
stage and will, therefore, be a direct
competitor with rutile.
Despite all the foregoing, it is appar-
ent from the annual accounts of AMC
that the average price which they have
been receiving for their metals has been
increasing over the past five years. The
table below has been extracted from
the annual reports of the company:
1963 '1964 H 1986 U96iB 1967
Sales value $ milll. 4 1 4 0 4 6 7.7 9.1
Tens rutile and
zircon ’OK) tons 84 8 ICII 7 '1129 1 1129.6' 141 0
Average pri'ce $ 48 47 51 59 54
The main problem is to estimate the
likely future costs per ton of metal
produced. It is rather difficult to calcu-
late mining costs from the AMC
accounts, although so far as the Wyong
accounts were concerned, when this
was a separate company, a better idea
could be obtained. The 1966/67 year
is a difficult one because of the inclu-
sion of only a few weeks of Wyong’s
results in the consolidated accounts, but
it does appear that costs increased quite
markedly. From an examination of the*
figures it seems that there would be
good prospects of the company making
at least $lB per ton on the combined
production of rutile and zircon in the
future. If production is at the rate of
180,000 tons of the combined metal this
year (1967/68), with good prospects
of this figure rising to 200,000 tons in
1968/69 and perhaps subsequently to
240,000 tons, then net profit before tax
should increase to about $3.24 million
in 1967/68 to $3.6 million in 1968/69
and afterward to $4.32 million.
In terms of earnings per share on
the present capital, this suggests 46c
1967/68, 53c in 1968/69, and, ultim-
ately, to 63c. Per share earnings there-
fore have a good chance of doubling in
the next five years and of increasing by
50 percent in 1967/68. At $6.80 the
shares are selling at less than 15 times
expected 1967/68 earnings. The record
of increases in dividend payments has
also been very attractive and has in-
creased from 8c in 1962/63 to 20c
in 1966/67 (after making adjustments
for new issues).
Here, then, is a mining stock which
does have “value.” I would think that,
having regard to the size of the reserves,
the shares should be worth considerably
more than their present $6.80.

Can Great Boulder buy luck?
NOW THAT GREAT BOULDER’S
report is out, how justified are the
optimists? Or, for that matter, the
pessimists? Certainly the actual results
of drilling released at the company’s
annual meeting did not in themselves
provide the basis for a wealthy nickel
mine and even Mr. Nilsen’s guess of
an orebody containing “a couple of
hundred thousand tons assaying one
and a half to two percent” is still in-
sufficient to support any sizable ven-
ture. But what more could be expected
after the company had drilled only a
dozen holes on a 100 ft. grid?
It is interesting to recall that, after
only four successful holes drilled on
its first anomaly, Western Mining
Corporation considered that the ore-
body indicated at that stage was of
sufficient size to warrant installing
equipment for early production, and it
made early plans for shaft sinking and
development for a mine to feed a
concentrating mill with a capacity of
8000 tons of ore per month. Between
February and May the company had
sunk seven drill holes on the original
anomaly, of which four holes struck
high grade nickel over good intersec-
tions covering a surface area of some
60,000 square feet and containing less
than 100,000 tons of nickel ore on the
results of the drilling at that time.
Western Mining also made its deci-
sion to commence mining at the time
when the price of nickel was some
$2OO per ton less than it is today. On
the basis of these four holes, which gave
an average grade of 4.7 percent nickel,
giving a value per ton of ore of some
$7O, Western Mining could no doubt
well afford to be disappointed, as its
shares at that time were less than $4.00.
Since that time, of course, reserves
at Kambalda have been increased to
over four million tons, but these in-
creases in reserves have brought the
average grade of ore down from the
initially high figures to some 3.65 per-
cent nickel.
Great Boulder was not nearly so
lucky in obtaining very high grades in
its first seven or eight holes, but, never-
theless, results at that time, after in-
cluding hole No. 22, where some 8.1
percent ore was encountered, were
quite respectable averaging, in fact,
some 1.35 percent nickel with quan-
tities of gold and arsenic. The first
seven successful holes were also spread
over a ground area of some 60,000
square feet, although the quantity of
ore was only about three-quarters of
that proved by Western Mining. The
results of further drilling, which were
given in the recent chairman’s address,
almost double the previous quantity
of ore, and in fact have meant a small
increase in average grade, from 1.35
percent nickel to 1.38 percent nickel.
On higher nickel prices Great
Boulder’s ore is worth about $22 per
ton. In September it was pointed out
in these columns that Great Boulder
could operate a mine at break-even
point with a recovered grade of 0.6
percent nickel, and with current prices
and costs, an average 1.0 percent would
be reasonably profitable by world
standards.
Great Boulder has been mining and
treating gold ore at an average cost of
$8 per ton. This is from mining at
depths around 3000 ft., while the nickel
intersections at the Mt. Martin mine
have so far been confined to depths of
less than 600 ft. It may perhaps be
optimisitic to assume that the company
could mine its nickel ore for the same
cost, but should this be so net profit
after tax would be in the vicinity of
$lO per ton of ore treated.
Obviously on reserves proved to date
this hardly justifies the market’s cur-
rent valuation of the company, but this
could easily be warranted by only a
fairly small increase in average ore re-
serve grade. For example, an addition
of 5 percent to average grade proved
to date would add an additional ssf
after tax to net profit per ton while an
increase of 1.0 percent would more
than double estimated profitability on
results so far. In calculating Great
Boulder’s average grade, grades of less
than 0.6 percent have been ignored,
and the company would only need to
have a couple of lucky holes to con-
siderably boost profit per ton; one
more intersection like the 6ft. of 8.1
percent nickel in hole 22 would have
the effect of increasing average grade
from 1.38 percent to 1.64 percent.
One rather encouraging factor is
that the company has obtained the re-
sults to date from exploration financed
out of its goldmining operations, and
these results have certainly been suf-
ficiently encouraging to warrant con-
tinued exploration. The company is
now going to accelerate explorations
and is making a one-for-five issue of
shares at $4.50 per share (of which
$4.40 will be available as to one-third
as an income tax deduction under Sec-
tion 78 (l)(b) of the Income Tax
Assessment Act). During the year to
June, 1967, Great Boulder spent
$31,804 on exploration and prospect-
ing; this would have included only the
preliminary work at the Mt. Martin
mine area and the holes drilled sub-
sequently would have cost considerably
more than this. It would be surprising
indeed if the $3.15m. to be raised by
the company does not buy its share of
good luck, especially as s2m. of this
will be spent fairly rapidly during the
period February to September next
year.


Commodities
Dealers lose on devaluation
ALL THE MAIN commodity markets
are still principally engaged in trying
to adjust to the pound’s devaluation.
Some London dealers, too, are (pain-
fully) attempting their own adjustments
to losses estimated at around £stg. 15
million.
Nearly all the losses were made on
forward contracts for Nigerian products,
namely cocoa, cotton, groundnuts, and
tin, concluded in terms of the Nigerian
pound, which was not devalued. So
when these contracts fall due they will
cost dealers nearly 17 percent more, a
loss they cannot recoup because they
in turn have sold most of what they had
bought prior to devaluation. There was
no way dealers could have protected
themselves. Commodities coming from
sterling area countries can only be
hedged in sterling area currencies.
Theoretically a dealer could have
insured himself against a loss by buying
Nigerian pounds forward for a date
to coincide with the time his contract
falls due. But there is no forward mar-
ket in Nigerian pounds. The only sterl-
ing area currency which it is possible
to buy forward is the pound sterling.
The Bank of England was asked to per-
mit dealers buying from the sterling
area to hedge against a possible devalu-
ation of the pound by buying dollars
forward. But this was refused on the
grounds that it could easily be used for
speculation against the pound.
Merchants dealing in Nigerian pro-
ducts were the only ones hit because
Nigeria was the only non-devaluing
sterling area country that contracted to
sell in its own currency. The rest were
prepared to sell in British pounds, and
as a result exporters in those countries
who have sold to Britain are in exactly
the same trouble as importers of
Nigerian products in Britain. They will
now get 17 percent less than they orig-
inally bargained for. If nothing is done
about this, there is a very real danger of
a widespread run of bankruptcies, not
only in Britain but also abroad. As far
as the exporters overseas are concerned,
this is a problem for their own Govern-
ments, though of course some of these
exporters could and have already
threatened to default on their contracts
unless they are paid at the new ex-
change rate for the pound. As regards
the London dealers, the Bank of Eng-
land could help them out: one way
would be for the bank to sell Nigerian
pounds at the old exchange rate for all

forward buying contracts on Nigerian
products made before devaluation and
for which the goods have already been
sold.
CASH TIN on the LME has been re-
ceiving a fair measure of buffer-stock
support, partly by actual buying and
also by mere bidding. This protection
has followed the International Tin
Council’s decision to lift the ranges of
buffer-stock operations by the whole
amount of the devaluation rate.
The present operative range appears
to be somewhat provisional, setting a
floor (when the buffer-stocks manager
must buy) at £stg.l2B3 a ton, pre-
viously £1100) and a ceiling (when
the manager must sell) at £1633 (pre-
viously £1400). Support can start when
prices go under £l4OO (£1200) and
selling may begin at £1516 (£1300).
The ITC is due to meet again on
January 16 and the market situation
will then be reviewed. Demand has
hardly been sufficient to give any sort
of test to the new range (this naturally
led to the latest support). British con-
sumption could well be lowered as a
result of the higher prices consequent
on devaluation.
WORLD SUGAR STOCKS may pos-
sibly decline next year. If so, this will
be their first fallback for a number of
years. Consumption has for quite some
time been lagging behind production
and accumulated stocks, so leading to
an almost continuous slump in free-
market prices.
The new position is forecast by the
well-known market analyst F. O. Licht
in an initial estimate covering 1967-68.
He puts total output at around 66.2 m.
metric tons, against 1966-67 s 65.2 m.
tons. Rather surprisingly, consumption
should hit 67m. tons for 1968 to con-
trast with the current 65m. tons. The
lower prevailing prices are actually aid-
ing the increase.
Last week’s London dealings pro-
duced a reasonably steady tone; any
temporary upward moves derived
mainly from short covering. Most of
the trade came from switching. Resist-
ance was very noticeable at top levels.
POST - DEVALUATION COPPER
prices on the London Metal Exchange
at one stage went to the limit of the
devaluation percentage. Most com-
modifies, of course, did not show this
behaviour. The tendency now is for
copper to slip down, yet its temporary
supply problems are manifest.
Doubts remain on how far official
intervention will go in the prolonged
U.S. strike. The Chilean wage nego-
tiations also appear to have failed.
There seems less talk about a possible
release from the American stockpile.
London presumably is having to cope
with some American buying and there
is mention of reduced LME stocks.
Consumer demand, however, looks
far from vigorous and the metal cer-
tainly has many problems in front of
it. Even in the present atmosphere, a
recent economic report by the Chase
Manhattan Bank states that the indus-
try, after it finishes wrestling with the
strike, will have to come to grips with
a likely production surplus. That sur-
plus, the bank believes, “could lower
United States producers’ prices in com-
ing years to slightly below the current
level of 38-38 J cents a lb.” LME prices
had almost dropped to this level just
before the strike.

A long, melancholy procession of retreats marked the very
obvious arrest of the mining boom; oils and industrials, too,
could hardly hold against this kind of mood. Great Boulder
naturally stood out with a $5.80 slide to $6.20, yet the roll
of other losses is a distinguished one led by BHP, down
$1.70 to $14.75, and Western Mining, down $2.90 to $27.00.

THE LAND
A place for cotton growing
in the economy?
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S
pre-Senate election largesse for the Ord
River (W.A.) and Emerald (Queens-
land) irrigation schemes has obviously
done nothing to still criticism of the
way in which these developments have
been planned, or indeed of their very
necessity. All the cracks continue to
gather to the fray, campaigning against
bounty-supported crops and fighting for
adequate cost-benefit analyses.
Right in the firing line is the dom-
estic growing of cotton. Only last week
a somewhat veteran controversialist, Dr.
Bruce Davidson, exasperatedly re-
marked that “if Australia wishes to pro-
duce cotton for an unstable export mar-
ket, surely it should be grown in the
region of least cost,” and suggested that
the existing Ord pilot scheme was suf-
ficient to enable the urgent experi-
mental work to be carried out. The
Bulletin’s “Agrisearch” (November 18)
also criticised a tendency to rush into
cotton on a gargantuan scale.
Behind most of the criticism is a
not-unfounded fear of more subsidy-
baited encouragement of crops which
can be 'better produced elsewhere and
a feeling that some of the analysis on
which Government decisions are based
does not bear public disclosure. It is
far too dangerous just to allow politics
alone to play havoc with scarce labor
and restricted capital resources.
Mr. Alistair Low, cotton breeder and
agronomist, of the CSIRO’s Division
of Irrigation Research at Griffith, be-
lieves “Agrisearch” painted an incom-
plete picture. There is a place for cot-
ton production in Australia’s economy,
bounty or no bounty, he maintains, and
his argument runs as follows:
What are the limiting factors—land,
water, manpower, or markets? It is
agreed that land is not, neither is
manpower if the crop is mechanised.
This leaves water and markets.
Water can hardly be considered
scarce. For example, “Agrisearch”
quoted 800 gallons per lib. of cotton
lint, 200 gallons for lib. of rice, and 50
gallons for lib. of vegetables or fruit.
That is correct but I believe it should
be emphasised that lib. of beef requires
4200 gallons, lib. of wool plus 3-2-lb.
lamb (irrigated) requires 18,000 gal-
lons! In Victoria, 90 percent of the
water is used on pastures, and, in
N.S.W., 50 percent for fat lamb, 40
percent for rice, and 10 percent for
fruit, vegetables, and cotton. If we are
to be realistic, the values of these pro-
ducts per unit area of land and labor
are all important considerations, so that
with average yields the gross value of
the crop per acre becomes the com-
parative factor. These are: Lettuce,
SABOO-$A1600; peaches, $800; onions,
$2BO-$560; cotton $280; rice $168; wool
and lamb, $56; beef, $4B ;wheat, $3B.
IF ASIA AND AFRICA are short of
food, would it not be better for them to
grow more food and less cotton? India
produces five million, Pakistan two mil-
lion, China six million, Africa six mil-
lion bales annually. Apart from some
irrigated areas, average yields are as low
as \ bale per acre due to the crop being
grown under rain-fed, hand-grown,
peasant holdings of one acre each. De-
predations from insects and diseases in
this patchwork type of production are
extremely difficult to control, com-
pared to the plantation type of cotton
production on the mechanised schemes
in Australia. Here yields from one-three
bales are the order of the day, good
on any world standards.
Man must clothe himself as well as
feed himself and cotton is a cheap way
of doing this. The grower of cotton is
also rewarded with profit for his effort.
An enormous potential in the tropics
lies dormant, but as the cost of living
rises the 1800 millions of Asia and
Africa will require cool cotton goods.
Only one shirt and shorts per head in
this area would require another three-
four million bales. In 1914 the world
consumed 24.2, 1954 36.8, and in 1967
52.5 million bales. In the next decade
it could be expected that 65 million
bales will be required. Are we to stand
aside and let others produce it? Japan
and Hong Kong alone require five
million bales annually, which they
presently obtain from America, Asia,
and Africa.
It is true that some man-made fibres
have made spectacular inroads, particu-
larly into the industrial markets for
cotton. Rayon had a similar history
previously but now is stabilised, whereas
it is the non-cellulosics which are now
in vogue. Present consumption of
staple, however, is in the temperate
affluent regions of the world. Does the
future potential lie here or in the
tropics?
The cotton industry has been resting
on its laurels, claiming two-thirds of
the world’s consumption of staple. Re-
cently it has awakened with a SU.S.3O
million research and promotion cam-
paign in the U.S.A. alone, to regain
markets and its former dominance.
The serious challenge to natural fibres
by synthetics is to the wool industry,
which claims only one-tenth of the
clothing fibres. Even the non-
cellulosics of highest tenacity are now
priced similarly to wool at 50-60 cents
a lb. compared to cotton and rayon at
25 cents.
Thus in irrigation areas cotton can
be grown at a profit and the future is
still bright, especially if we use the
research knowledge we now possess and
put it into use.
Agrisearch
The virtues of Charolais
UNDER THE RECENTLY relaxed
quarantine regulations we could have
Charolais-cross calves here within three
years if all goes well. Semen may now
be imported direct from the U.K. pro-
vided it can be certified free of blue-
tongue and other disease. The requisite
screening tests take two years. New
Zealand imported semen in the spring
of 1965 to inseminate cows of both
beef and dairy breeds. Performance
figures for farm-reared yearling
progeny are now available. They indi-
cate how much our caution is costing
us.
For instance, Charolais-Aberdeen
Angus and Charolais-Friesian bull
calves on Mr. J. M. Sutherland’s South
Island farm at Waimate weighed an
average 11171 b. at 350 days of age. The
heifers scaled 9661 b. Daily weight gains
for the 110 days after weaning ranged
from 2.991 b. to 4.961 b. among the bulls
and 3.101 b. to 3.501 b. among the heifers.
The weaning weights of these calves
were about the same as the weights


CLEAN vs. SMUT
It is a fact that ten years ago, before the emergence of the great Australian Aff-
luence, people and places really did look cleaner. Today, our beaches, highways, parks
and populace appear to be on the losing end of the battle for cleanliness. But not
our office buildings. Certainly not office buildings that are cleaned and cared for by
Crothall. They wage a battle against dust, dirt and grime that is never ending. And
they are winning. Crothall people, Crothall materials and the Crothall system of
cleaning is a combination that cannot be beaten. For premium quality cleaning service

that other beef cattle on this farm
had attained only after 12 to 18
months. Moreover, the Angus and
Friesian mothers were all heifers. These
impressive growth rates compare favor-
ably with the best results recorded in
the U.S.A. and the U.K. The world
record for a yearling bull, held by a
Charolais, is 154818.
Pastures on Mr. Sutherland’s farm
were poor this year because rainfall
was much below normal. After wean-
ing in April, the calves were offered a
winter supplement of up to 21b. of
barley grain and 51b. of grass hay. The
farmer believes that in an average year,
with a May-June calving, he could
have his Charolais-cross ready for sale
the following May and not have to
carry them over winter. This is out
of the question with his other beef
stock, which rarely reach market
weight before they are 20 months old.
Calving difficulties were encountered
like those reported from Europe. Charo-
lais cattle carry their calves about four
days longer than other breeds, and so
the birth weights are unusually high.
The New Zealand crosses weighed up
to 1201 b. at birth. With this year’s
drop there has been no trouble because
most of the cows were second calvers
and Mr. Sutherland took care to keep
them from getting too fat during preg-
nancy. A survey study conducted in
Ireland found that, with mature cows,
calving losses are no greater among
Charolais-cross than other breeds. The
Irish recommend against mating heifers
to Charolais.
In the Irish economy cattle are even
more vital than sheep are in ours. The
Irish felt that they could not afford to
forgo the advantages of having the
breed and that the risk of introducing
disease could be virtually eliminated by
importing the cattle from the U.S.A.
rather than directly from France, their
country of origin. A pure-bred herd of
12 bulls and 50 females is now main-
tained in Ireland and the country’s
A.I. Service can now supply semen to
any farmer who wants to raise Charo-
lais-cross cattle. Indeed, farmers are
exhorted to avail themselves of this
opportunity.
The Irish, who export a lot of beef
to England, are very keen on Charolais.
They are satisfied it produces more
meat from a given quantity of feed
more quickly than any other breed.
Recently they measured and compared
carcass composition. Charolais crosses,
they found, carried five percent less fat
than Hereford crosses and yielded five
percent more lean meat from com-
mercially boned carcasses. Shorthorn
and Friesian carcasses were also in-
ferior. A notable feature of the pure-
bred Charolais is its well-developed
loin muscles. This characteristic
appears to express itself firmly in all
crossbred progeny.
The Charolais, furthermore, suits the
English consumer. Professor E. M.
Carpenter, Department of Agricultural
Marketing, University of Newcastle-
on-Tyne, is making a careful study
of English people’s preferences in beef.
Tenderness has proved to be by far
the most important single feature.
Leanness is the next most important
attribute. Flavor, however, matters
little to the average person in London,
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, and
Newcastle. People simply do not appre-
ciate the rich flavor which only steak
from mature beasts possesses. Yearling
beef, which is tender and lean but rela-
tively flavorless, fits the bill.
A Texas study of milk production
in the Charolais, Aberdeen-Angus, and
Hereford disclosed that as milkers these
three breeds ranked in the above order.
Rate of growth of the calves followed
the same order, although the Hereford
calves gained most per pound of milk
received. Another odd finding was that
cows of each of the breeds automatic-
ally produce more milk when they are
rearing a bull calf than when the calf
is a heifer.
The Irish, of course, are using their
Charolais primarily on dairy cows to
get quality beef carcasses. The
country’s second economic expansion
program requires the output of cattle to
rise from its present 1.2 million a year
to 1.5 million by 1970 “without a cor-
responding expansion in milk output.”
The New Zealanders have a some-
what similar plan. Now, with the
British having devalued their money,
our dairy industry is going to find
the sale of traditional products even
harder. But though butter-eaters may
switch their allegiance to margarine,
beef-eaters remain beef-eaters at almost
any cost. Rather than increase the
present subsidies we could, perhaps,
help our dairyfarmers move into beef
production. And this is where the Char-
olais comes in: no other beef breed
crosses so effectively with dairy cattle
for meat production.
Strangely, the Queensland beef
ranchers have shown more interest in
getting Charolais blood into Australia
than any other group. Whether we
could build a large dairy-Beef industry
relying on imported Charolais semen
seems doubtful. The British, knowing
that they can allay Australian qualms
about disease, are demanding half a
sterling guinea for an ampoule of
semen. After adding various other
charges and taking account of loss of
potency in two-year-old semen, only
stud breeders would find the economics
attractive. The best solution, finally,
may be to do as the Americans, Irish,
and British themselves did import
the animals. The fact that these three
countries have managed to avoid bring-
ing in disease with the cattle suggest
that modern quarantine precautions are
reliable.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Well meet again in Adelaide
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
AUTUMN, 1968, holds promise for
Adelaide of a State Election, the Fifth
Biennial Festival of Arts, a Hungarian
whistler, but not, I am afraid, Vera
Lynn. It also holds the threat of the
closest and most critical scrutiny the
city has yet faced from its public.
For the first three Festivals, in 1960,
1962, 1964, the mood of the audience
moved from scepticism, to surprise, to
pleasure as it became clear that not
only could Adelaide manage an Arts
festival at all, but it could stage a good
one.
Some of the applause, of course, was
for the simple totality of the events and
performances being seen to be done,
rather than for their excellence; stem-
ming from an attitude that might be
termed the Dr. Johnson’s dog syn-
drome. The mounting fame of the Fes-
tival at last brought the inevitable cul-
tural backlash in 1966. The Festival
and its organisation began to be judged
by the highest standards. It was not
surprising that in some respects they
were found wanting.
The much publicised play of Peter
Shaffer, “The Royal Hunt of the Sun,”
was not so much seen as endured in
the vault of Bonython Hall, where the
words were lost to the roof, the atmos-
phere, according to one critic, was “like
a phone booth in summer,” and any-
one shorter than Charles De Gaulle
could not observe much of the drama.
The organisation was described as
“seemingly haphazard” by the secre-
tary of the London Symphony Orches-
tra, who could find no focal point
from which the Festival organisation
emanated. He also complained that the
Festival should set a minimum stan-
dard for artists and performers instead
of mixing in first-rate amateurs and
third-rate professionals with the top
pros.
The Festival easily withstood the
stirrings of dissatisfaction and rested
on its numerous successes and some
triumphs: the Athens Drama Com-
pany’s “Iphigenia in Aulis,” the exhibi-
tions of Lawrence Daws and Hans
Heysen, Yevtushenko, Dame Judith
Anderson, the Australian Ballet, the
LSO.
Next year holds out the musical attrac-
tions of Mahler’s huge “Eighth Sym-
phony,” with the South Australian and
Melbourne Symphony Orchestras and a
choir of several hundred voices under
the direction of Henry Krips, recitals
by Rita Streich and pianist Annie
Fischer, the Zagreb soloists, and the
first performance of a wind quintet by
Peter Sculthorpe, specially commissioned
for the Festival, to name some.
The Mahler Symphony is the second
most popular in the early bookings. In
top place is the Salzburg Marionette
Theatre, whose two- to three-foot-high
marionettes move and dance through
Three members of the Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe, which will be appearing
at the Fifth Adelaide Festival of Arts in March, 1968
the operas of Mozart in some mysteri-
ously appropriate way. Their reputation
is great enough to put them higher in
the ratings than Marlene Dietrich, who
is running third.
The Dietrich story, which ends as a
fine coup for the Festival organisers,
has its sad side. Mrs. Litchfield, who is
arranging the pop side of the Festival,
explains that before the big star was
secured there was some tight bargain-
ing over .money and location; Miss
Dietrich wanted more than has ever
before been paid by the Festival and
got it, and also insisted on a city theatre
negotiations were proceeding with a
number of other light entertainers and
vocalists, including Vera Lynn. Just as
the Festival was ready to sign Miss Lynn
on the issues of where and when, Miss
Dietrich became available and Miss
Lynn was summarily left to contem-
plate the lights of London and other
local pleasures.
(An Adelaide taxidriver to whom I
told this brief story lifted his accelerator
foot in disappointment and said he
remembered the time when Vera Lynn
used to make him cry: “I couldn’t stop
myself. I’d drive a hundred miles to see
her. She’s probably fat now, though.”)
But some consolation may be pro-
vided by Tamas Hacki, a fifth-year
Hungarian medical student, whom the
Festival publicity describes as having
“probably the most unusual gift in
entertainment today.” He whistles,
sometimes with orchestral backing and
sometimes with individual instruments,
such as bass or organ or drums or
french horn; sometimes he just whistles.
The Festival Theatre is hoping for
something memorable from Australian
writer Patricia Hooker, whose commis-
sioned play, “The Lotos Eaters” (“o”
as in Holt) is a comedy about the rela-
tions between wharflaborers in North
Queensland sugar ports and their em-
ployers. George Farquhar’s late Restor-
ation comedy “The Recruiting
Officer”; and Gogol’s “The Inspector-
General” are also likely to draw large
though uncomfortable houses.
The great obstacle to the hopes of
the Festival organisers that they might
bring out teams of players from the
Abbey Theatre or Stratford is that
Adelaide lacks a suitable hall to present


them. The same, of course, is true for
symphony orchestras, the opera, and
the ballet (Mahler will be performed
at the Showgrounds). The Adelaide
City Council has been talking about one
for years but lacks the money to build.
Last week the Council heard the recom-
mendation of a special Festival Hall
committee that a triple-purpose hall
was needed for music, opera, and ballet
and to seat 2000 to 2300 people.
The Council decided to ask the
State Government and the Prime
Minister to help it finance the cost of
a Festival Hall.
The committee suggested that a con-
cert hall could be managed by the
Council, but a hall for two or more
purposes was beyond its financial
powers, and suggested that the State
Government be asked to make up the
difference. Since the Premier, Mr.
Dunstan, is something of a patron of
the arts and letters (unlike his prede-
cessor) there are firm grounds to sup-
Lucero Tena, Spanish dancer, will take
part in the Adelaide Festival of Arts
pose that the construction of a hall is
not too far away.
The absence of a hall will at least not
interfere with the Festival’s Writers’
Week. The writers’ section does not
appear to contain anything as attrac-
tive as Marlene Dietrich, but it is pretty
certain Edna O’Brien, Irish, redheaded,
and not yet out of her 30s, will be
there along with Anthony Burgess,
Malcolm Mason from New Zealand,
four Russian writers, including the
übiquitous Madame Krugeskaya, pos-
sibly William Golding, probably some
Indians, or Japanese, and no Ameri-
cans. Robert Lowell was asked but
couldn’t come.
For Madame K., a permanent accom-
panist to touring Russians, it will be
a case of we’ll meet again, but no such
luck for poor Vera Lynn.
Festival for
the few
By DUNCAN GRAHAM
PERTH’S Festival, for years bom-
barded with schemes and ideas that
have made it dart about the cultural
oscilloscope in search of a firm policy
pattern, now seems to have found one.
Western Australians long ago stopped
thinking of their festival as anything
more than an intellectual romp for the
few who prefer not to spend their
summer on the beach.
The lack of a major venue is one
of the problems, for, despite pleas,
platitudes, and promises, Perth still
lacks a concert hall. We find office
blocks more profitable. The Festival’s
stout and effervescent boss, 54-year-old
John Birman, claims this is severely
handicapping the Festival’s develop-
ment and creating planning headaches.
So once again the Festival will centre
on and around the lush, beautiful, and
venue-rich university, the hub of W.A.’s
most affluent and festival-conscious
suburban community. Other districts
remain as arid as the bituminised acres
of drive-in cinemas, the cultural centres
for outer-suburbia.
Enough preamble. Perth’s sixteenth
Festival, estimated cost $150,000, will
run from February 3 to March 9. It
is now linked with the Adelaide,
Christchurch, and Auckland festival
circuits, so internationally big artists
can be offered engagements of sufficient
length and reward.
Coloratura-soprano Rita Streich will
give one lieder recital at the university’s
Winthrop Hall, and then on to Adel-
aide. The French Jacques Loussier trio,
a jazz combination specialising in J. S.
Bach’s music, will give two perform-
ances. The Zagreb Soloists, a 13-
member ensemble led by conductor-
cellist Antonio Janigro, are also going
on to Adelaide.
British organist Gillian Weir will
give recitals on the big university
organ. The Festival committee is still
negotiating on possibilities of the Ballet
Classique de France appearing in Perth
for two performances. The Madrid-
based Lucero Tena Company of
flamenco dancers and castanet players
will stay six days before moving to the
Adelaide Festival.
The international films, invariably
the most popular Festival feature, will
again be shown before and during the
Festival. Highlights will be “Marat
Sade,” “Accident,” and “Romeo and
Juliet” (U.K.), “The Gospel Accord-
ing to St. Matthew” (Italy), and Orson
Welles’ “Falstaff” (Spain-Switzerland).
The university’s Elizabethan-replica
New Fortune Theatre will be used for
Shakespeare’s “Richard III,” directed
by N.S.W. University lecturer Philip
Parsons. Melbourne’s St. Martin’s
Theatre will stage Thomas Keneally’s
“Halloran’s Little Boat” and Charles
Dyer’s “Staircase” at the Perth Play-
house (National Theatre), while a
local group will do Errol Johns’ “Moon
on a Rainbow Shawl.”
Fringe activities will include univer-
sity debates, an exhibition of Scandin-
avian design, a South African satirical
show, and lectures by authors Peter
Cowan and Judith Wright.
The Sidney Nolan retrospective and
an exhibition of seven W.A. painters
head the art attractions.
Last season a one-night expensive
experimental dinner-concert was a
sell-out and as popular as the free
open-air pop concerts. These will be
repeated this season.
Art
Bonython: faith
or folly?
By ELWYN LYNN
The Kym Bonython Gallery. Padding-
ton, Sydney.
IT’S EASY to pummel the pundits, but
that amorphous mass called the art
world has been making so many com-
ments on whether Mr. Bonython has
done his dough on his new gallery,
called both an act of faith and a folly,
that one would imagine that art-lovers
were also experts on the local economy.
Not even the dealers are that: for
example, except for a Christmas show
or prints, they neglect the middle-
income earners, and many dealers are
so wedded to collectors with fixed
ideas and full walls that it must sur-
prise them that Georges Mora, with
an equally fine taste in food and paint-
ing, has discovered a new wave of
buyers.
Still, art-lovers must be excused their
skirmishes with market research, be-
cause the drum of art as investment,
with aesthetic enjoyment as a side
effect that you can take or leave, has
been banged so often that the artist
who doesn’t gradually raise his prices
appears to be intent on ruining the
currency.
What ought to take precedence in
the thinking about the gallery is that
Australia, with the Opera House about
two miles away from it, driving home
the lesson, has done it first, for as far
as I can tell, and I know nothing of
South America, Bonython’s is the most
commodious commercial gallery in the
world and reminds us that art doesn’t
necessarily flourish in the largest and
most powerful cities and countries.
Europe and America are so full of tiny
rooms, boutiques, and series of cubby-
holes, spatially tormenting and
tortuous, all aiming at enshrining the
work of art as sacred object, that one
welcomes the vistas at Bonython’s, for
half-way between the usual gallery and
the museum, his gallery gives the


viewer an excellent opportunity to dis-
criminate.
The site raised problems: there could
be no imposing edifice or entrance to
induce the right mood, so a terrace
house was modified as ante-chamber
with a Japanese (sic) garden and
some spatial niggling which opens sud-
denly to the vista down the main
gallery, 20 by 100 feet, and across the
60ft.-square courtyard. It had to
be free of windows on the outside and
a certain spatial monotony has been
broken by doors that open on to the
court. There are, of course, other solu-
tions: Philip Johnson’s gallery at Utica
is a dark, 'positive, windowless building,
but once inside one feels that the unob-
trusive spatial deployment implies win-
dows, and certainly their absence is
unnoticed. On the other hand, the
Marl'borough-Gerson, a fairly large
gallery in a New York skyscraper, has
its windows so screened off that
aesthetic and soporific claustrophobia
intervenes. It seems that in looking
at works of art one needs to be con-
stantly reminded of one’s own identity,
the identity of the work and of the out-
side world. Certainly Bonython’s court-
yard doors allow you to know where
you are.
The problem was to surround a
square with three and half galleries,
and the designer’s decision for the pan-
oramic view means that without the
addition of solid screens, works that
demand the niche and the cul-de-sac
are at a disadvantage. Phillip Johnson’s
solution for the additions to the
Museum of Modern Art was to have a
windowless polygonal with walls like
radii coming from the vertices to an
open centre; but it is a gallery that is
all bays and is marvellous for intimist
painters, like Bonnard in 1964, sur-
realism, or Matisse, but hardly for
Pollock and color-field painting. Bony-
thon’s panoramic view is excellent for
Coburn’s tapestries and the two Victor
Pasmore’s now on show (I’ve previ-
ously reviewed these tapestries and the
Marlborough selection), but Piper and
Nicholson suffer a little. (The contrary
view is expressed by an ebullient
Sydney dealer in rather shabby
premises: “Anything bought at my
gallery is bound to look better when
they get it home.”)
And if the shapes are hardly stimu-
lating, they are free of the spiralling
vertigo induced by Frank Lloyd
Wright’s Guggenheim, and one has few
objections to the print room and the
ceramics gallery, which is showing some
fine Japanese pottery.
The other new gallery of significance
in Sydney is Clune’s pop-in, pop-out
terrace in Macquarie Street, located in
an affluent and library-museum area as
though it was intended for New York,
where the businessman is captive all
day in the city, but Bonython’s venture
fits in with the Paddington complex of
galleries, avoids the St. Kilda and
South Yarra dispersal, and recognises
that Sydney doesn’t need an inner-city
collection of galleries.
While you may admire the billed
shows and fine works by Whiteley,
Plate (a 1961 tough serialisation of seg-
ments), Kitching, Reinhard, Boyd,
Gleghorn, Cant, James, Salkauskas, and
Tony Woods, there is piped music that
some dismiss as Musak (which it isn’t)
interfering with contemplation: if you
can’t look at your Picasso and Pollock
and listen to Boulez, Beethoven, gravel-
throated Bessie, and the chink of ice in
whisky at the same time, you are
opting for catatonia not contemplation,
for the latter is always associated with
resistance: mercifully the music and the
spaces at Bonython’s hardly resist most
of the present works at all.
Theatre
Local product
By ROBERT HART
The Wrong Way Out Of Bed. Burton
Graham. Arts, Brisbane.
IT WAS PROBABLY the enthusiastic
way in which Brisbane Arts Theatre
audiences responded to his earlier plays
which persuaded Melbourne writer
Burton Graham to let this theatre have
first shot at his latest.
The play is about Bill Andrews,
a young advertising man with not so
much as a sniff of an American accent.
Andrews has his own small agency.
He also has a very pregnant wife, a
young son, a small flat, a landlady who
wants Bill’s dog debarked, and an un-
finished novel. Naturally.
Andrews also has a secretary called
Loris who wears outfits as tiny as her
mind and who can empty a tin of hair-
spray faster than any secretary in the
block in which he has an office. And
as if this were not enough to unsettle
even the most well-adjusted young ad-
man about town, he has a client called
Mr. Sarbo, who demonstrates “the
fallacy of misplaced concreteness” with
a brick and a ripe tomato.
Mr. Graham gives Andrews every
incentive to turn off. And Andrews does
just that. In the process, he fires,
offends, or confuses everyone in sight.
And laughs come at a pace which
gives the audience precious little time
to themselves. Mr. Graham plants his
play firmly in Australia and his charac-
ters come from a very real part of the
Australian idiom without shouting it at
you. The play has a lot of action sewn
up by a quite splendid third act.
Director Tina Flor relies on the
speed of the play and seldom does any
pushing of her own. This is a pity. In
the central role, Bryon Williams does
all the right things, but most of them
he doesn’t do hard enough. Only Carol
Burns as Loris really does anything
with her part that Mr. Graham hasn’t
done already.

Scenes from Opera. Conservatorium
Opera School, Sydney.
LAST WEEKEND, the Sydney Con-
servatorium’s Opera School presented
three programs of “Scenes from
Opera.” Since this opera school, with
Ronal Jackson as permanent principal,
has now functioned for a full year, it
seemed timely to inspect its efforts.
The occasion was strictly a “school”
one; and Mr. Joseph Post, the Con-
servatorium’s director, was strong in
his insistence that no professional stan-
dards of judgment should as yet be
applied.
No doubt a great deal of work had
to be done before five complete scenes
—from two Mozart operas, two of
Verdi’s, and one of Smetana’s—could
be staged. I could not but feel rather
sorry for these hard-working young
artists, setting out toward operatic goals
in a virtual vacuum. However fine
their voices, however proficient they
may become on stage, their prospects
of operatic employment in Australia
are negligible. Particularly pleasing
was the emergence, for probably their
first public occasion, of the ABC’s
National Training Orchestra, directed
by Robert Miller, who acquitted them-
selves remarkably well. They played
with a will, they stayed together, and
despite their still limited experience,
sounded more professional than the
orchestra currently touring with the
Australian Ballet.
The two singers who impressed me
most were Robin Holmes, who sang the
difficult role of Cherubino from “The
Marriage of Figaro” with sweetness
and aplomb, and John Wood, whose
Rigoletto was distinguished by a fine,
big voice and a powerful stab at
dramatic acting. As far as singing
goes, these two were closely followed by
a few others: Graeme Williams as
Figaro, Michele Davies as Gilda, with
the promise of a fine coloratura style,
Denise Allen as Amneris, and Robert
Haase as a strident Kecal.
Lest it be thought that all was un-
alloyed bliss, some shortcomings must
be pointed out. The action of many of
the principals (in the Sadler’s Wells
tradition, all parts were sung in Eng-
lish) left much to be desired, and the
mangling of vowels in some pretty
mouths was quite dreadful. Choruses
were too big and the producers, par-
ticularly in “The Bartered Bride” open-
ing scene, irritated by constant fussy
stage movements which tended to dis-
tract one’s attention from the music.

Films
Cultural coddling
By PHILLIP ADAMS
SO WE’RE GOING to have an arts
council. And there’s talk of a sub-
sidised film industry. All at once the
idea of increased Government involve-
ment in culture ceases to be the sub-
ject of prayer and becomes a subject
for urgent debate. Most of us have
wanted it, but now we’re going to get
it it’s time to look in the gift horse’s
mouth. What are the proper limits
of Government involvement? And at
what point does encouragement become
control?
Perhaps we can find some answers
Innokenty Smoktunovsky ... Russian
Richard Burton
in the experience of the Soviet Union.
There was a time when Stalin banned
the filming of any Russian city in the
rain. Yet in that era of shackled in-
tellectualism Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and
Dovzhenko managed to make some of
the most brilliant films in cinema his-
tory. Perversely, the post-Stalinist
thaw has produced some technically
ingenious and politically provocative
material—but nothing with half the
stature of an “Earth” or a Gorki
trilogy.
In the hope of getting some insight,
I attended a Melbourne Film Festival
workshop with a visiting Soviet dele-
gation. The guests were Innokenty
Smoktunovsky, a Lenin prize winner
and star of the Russian wide-screened
“Hamlet”; Margarita Voldina, a prom-
inent cinema and stage actress; and
Eldar Ryazanov, the young director of
a number of Soviet comedies including
the Keystonish “Watch Your Car.”
Translated into English (or American)
the group was roughly the Russian
counterpart to Richard Burton, Vanessa
Redgrave, and perhaps Frank Tashlin.
They were a genuinely top-level trio.
The first impact they made was in
contrast to earlier cultural delegations.
The polite caution that characterised
the visiting writers in the late ’fifties
and early ’sixties was gone. Smoktu-
novsky is a grinning gremlin of a man
with a Harpo Marx smile. Voldina is
quiet, soft-eyed, and charming, and
Ryazanov a bear of a man with an
echo-chamber laugh.
All three scorned Soviet critics
(“They’re all failed artists”) and freely
discussed the difficulties of pushing
through experimental films. They com-
plained about the poor color quality of
their 35mm. work as compared to the
U.S.A.’s —but praised the standards of
their new 70mm. laboratories.
But for the most part the group was
understandably happy with the system
that had given them so much success.
They explained that most Russian
actors and directors were trained in
specialised tertiary institutions, and
that, for example, stage and screen
actors did completely separate courses.
Smoktunovsky was proud to be an
exception to the rule, having been
trained in medicine. Even critics could
do five-year courses, “but none of them
that have finished have been any good.”
Up to 125 students vied for every
place in these training courses. But
once they graduated they were guaran-
teed work. Would-be directors had only
to work a one- or two-year apprentice-
ship before making films on their own,
And provided they didn’t make too
many disasters they were right for life.
Directors, writers, and actors were
grouped together in “artistic councils”
at the major studios, under the direc-
tion of an “artistic councillor.” Out of
group discussions, a project would take
form. The groups were free to propose
any type of film, and while its potential
popularity was a factor in gaining
approval to proceed, “if a subject was
considered worth while it would be
made anyway.”
Once complete, a film would then
be dubbed into various languages and
dialects and distributed throughout the
Republics. Up to 2000 prints would be
released, and a popular film could
expect a home audience of around
60,000,000.
Fees were standardised, so to get the
services of a top star competing direc-
tors would offer escalating fringe
benefits. To get Smoktunovsky to star
in “Watch Your Car,” Ryazanov con-
fessed to offering such bribes as “some-
one to do his garden and someone to
go shopping for his wife.”
There was little interference from
“up top.” For example, while Ryazanov
had been discussed unfavorably by the
Central- Committee, he’d been chosen
to make an important film of a his-
toric battle. “Characteristically,” said
Smoktunovsky, “he made it into a
comedy.”
A third to half the films shown in
the Soviet were from overseas. “We see
them all, Antonioni and the rest,” they
said, “but no one director is having a
wide influence.” Many Soviet films
which enjoyed great success interna-
tionally were failures •at home. For
example, “Shadows of My Forgotten
Ancestors” (a young director’s first
film), which had been acclaimed at
many Western festivals, had been given
the thumbs down by the Soviet public.
I asked Smoktunovsky to compare
his Hamlet (filmed to a script by
Boris Pasternak) with that of Olivier.
He admitted that Olivier had been not
only an influence but an obstacle to his
own performance. “I couldn’t see
around Olivier for a long, long time.”
Finally, he’d found what he considered
a new and valid interpretation and
played the part “with more simplicity.”
His Hamlet, he felt, was far less devious
and complex than Olivier’s. “Mine was
a gentle character,” he said, having
made some rude remarks about the
film’s director.
I explained that the only patronage
most local film-makers enjoyed came
from business in the form of commis-
sions to make commercials. Had they
seen any? And if so, what did they
think of this capitalist art form? “We
find them very strange,” was the con-
sensus, although Ryazanov admitted
that one had promoted him into buying
“something for cleaning.” I pointed out
that some of these little films had cost
up to 20,000 roubles to produce. “Who
pays?” asked Ryazanov suspiciously.
I asked if it was possible for Russians
to make films outside the system. The
group found the question difficult to
answer. “The problem has never
arisen.” After all, there was no short-
age of work and no oppressive limita-
tions. So why bother? However, many
thousands of Russians did make Bmm.
and 16mm. films on an amateur basis,
and even had regional festivals. The
best of this output was then shown on
TV.
TV has its own separate ministry
and independent film-making facilities.
Documentaries were made in regional
studios throughout the Soviet, but
creatively they were sadly banal. How-
ever, good short films were being pro-
duced mainly by students in the
course of their training. And students
could even produce feature films for
their purposes.
So, while the Russians aren’t currently
hitting the creative heights, it seems
they’re having a lot of fun. As they
laughed and talked the local filmies
grew increasingly envious, and their
questions showed remarkable depths
of bitterness. Most of them, it seemed,
couldn’t wait to be taken over and
coddled by a cultural bureaucracy.


BOOKS
Enjoying opera as another
great spectator sport
By DAVID SALTER
Australia’s Music. Roger Covell. Sun
Books. $1.95.
THE SUBTITLE OF this book
“Themes of a New Society”—had me
worried right till the end. It was a fear
that eventually Mr. Covell would take
up a grandly omniscient vantage point
and begin discussing Australia’s musical
development in the unbearably fashion-
able “culture and society” manner.
Fortunately he doesn’t and the tag
seems to be an afterthought on the
publisher’s part rather than a conscious
framework within which the author
chose to place his discussion.
Roger Covell, music critic for the
“Sydney Morning Herald” and Senior
Lecturer in Music at the University of
New South Wales, has written a
scholarly and long-needed account of
our musical development. What one
might well expect of a critic-turned-
historian a distinctly personal atti-
Roger Covell ... provocative theory
tude has been reduced to a remark-
able minimum. Only in Chapter Seven,
which deals with composition in this
country since the mid-’fifties, does the
prose and judgment of the critic re-
place that of the scholar. Covell quotes
broadly from some of his reviews here,
and as the section is almost 100 pages
it becomes pretty exhausting toward
the end. His comments on our major
contemporary composers are, how-
ever, perceptive, and, more import-
antly, well reasoned, giving a balanced
summary of a period of which no
comprehensive assessment has yet been
offered.
In other areas our musical pre-
history, the nationalist goals of
Grainger and Hill, the growth of the
ABC and Musica Viva, opera in Aus-
tralia the author has presented a
source work of immense value. In
many ways the volume will become a
handbook and guide to those un-
familiar with music in this country.
Mr. Coveil argues convincingly for his
analyses of the underlying trends and is
careful to relate each to the other in a
gradually unfolding explanation of why
Australian music moved in the direc-
tion it did.
The call he makes for a revival of
Grainger’s startlingly diverse and ex-
perimental output should be heeded by
the large concert agencies. It seems
symptomatic of our cultural blindness
that we have not demanded to hear
these works, the most avant-garde pro-
ductions of their time.
Coveil is most impressive in his
discussion of the ABC and of the
history of opera. His conclusion that
the Commission’s original orchestral
policy was a magnificent gamble which
paid off might appear hollow in the
light of present wobbly standards, but
it points to the often overlooked fact
that we have a handsome group of
regularly performing symphony orches-
tras, all of which contribute enorm-
ously to the development of local music
and musicians.
On the popularity of opera and the
outstanding successes of Australian
singers, Mr. Covell puts forward a pro-
vocative theory: “My own belief is
that one of the peculiar affinities of
Australians with opera is through its
sporting quality. People who like art
to be chaste, exclusive, and unfailingly
high-minded are often perturbed by
the elements of sheer display and
brazen dexterity that have been endemic
to opera since its earliest years. Any-
one excessively troubled by such
scruples will probably not care for
opera as an art form, for it is an
essential part of its nature to be able
to accommodate both sublime or in-
tensely spiritual expressions of feeling,
and demonstrations of what is indis-
tinguishable from sporting agility.”
From this he constructs a thesis
which explains the popularity of opera
as an outgrowth of the Australian
passion for spectator sports and the
triumphs of Melba, Sutherland, etc.,
as the natural evidence of our native
sporting prowess. If we lead the world
in tennis, golf, swimming, and foot-
ball, why not in opera singers?
The most significant factors of this
book are not its qualities of minor
shortcomings but that it has been
written and should be read. Walk into
any large store and ask for a volume
on Australian painting, prose, or poetry
and you will be offered a reasonable
choice of authors and treatments; ask
to be shown the range in music and
until now you would have drawn a
puzzled shrug.
If “Australia’s Music” is read and
digested by a sufficient number of the
general public (and of course by those
concerned with music), it might be
saved from a fate of collecting dust
on the shelves of public libraries, and
in that way stimulate more research
and documentation of this vital and
rapidly broadening sphere of our cul-
tural development.
Elusive Melba
By CHARLES HIGHAM
Melba. John Hetherington. F. W. Ches-
hire, and Faber and Faber. $6.95.
HETHERINGTON’S BIOGRAPHY
of Melba has an oddly old-fashioned
tone. Describing her birth, he writes:
“The autumn day had been serene,
with nothing to foreshadow the tem-
pests as well as the triumphs in store
for the infant sleeping against her
mother’s breast,” and all through the
book he introduces this Victorian strain,
referring to the great events ahead as
though providing us with a series of
teasers, done in cross-stitch with a
border of violets.
As dogged and thorough as his sub-
ject, the author has researched every-
thing, interviewed everyone, combed
through letters. We are even given par-
ticulars of the life of Melba’s husband
in Canada, where he continued to an
advanced old age. Everything is here:
the sturdy, five-foot-six brunette leav-
ing the Presbyterian Ladies’ College,
singing lessons from the mercurial
Pietro Cecchi (whom Mr. Hethering-
ton sympathetically restores to his
proper place in Melba’s career); her
marriage to Charles Armstrong, boxer,


rider, farmer, and itinerant; her jour-
ney to Europe and her training under
Marchesi, and the brilliant career that
took in Covent Garden and the Met;
and encounters with some of the great-
est names of a far richer period than
this.
Yet somehow the personality of
Melba remains elusive. Mr. Hethering-
ton cannot fully illuminate the real
woman, even though her vulgarity and
toughness, her drive and raw energy
are clearly exposed. Like all the other
biographers, he can only give us a
brief glimpse into her romantic attach-
ments, and he does not bring to life her
affair with the Due d’Orleans, a scandal
that perhaps deserved a Proust, or at
the very least a Dumas, to give it sub-
stance.
And this brings me to the book’s
ichief weakness: for all its detailed
(recording of facts, for all its care, its
patient and methodical writing, it does
not quite place Melba in a European
setting, does not quite give us the
flavor of a marvellous era. Perhaps
this is due to Mr. Hetherington’s own
remoteness from the scene in time and
(through living in Melbourne for so
long) in space. One gets the impres-
sion of a book researched rather than
lived; it smells, often, of lamp. As
we read of the battle with Tetrazzini
fully and ably chronicled of
Mary Garden’s comment on Melba’s
“La Boheme” (“I never saw such a
fa.t Mimi in my life”), of Caruso and
Jean de Reszke, we are carried for-
ward, but we cannot really see the
stage as brilliantly illuminated as it
should be. It was a tragedy that Melba
died before she could be filmed for
posterity in a talkie.
Then we should have seen the fire
and the temperament, have heard the
exquisite, clear, radiant voice Mr. Heth-
erington describes, a voice we can hear
screeching on primitive recordings. It
is the tragedy of stage stars up to the
dawn of sound movies that their
achievements always have to be taken
on trust; all the thunder of the biog-
raphers cannot match one small proof
of their excellence.
Candid enigma
By NANCY KEESING
Miles Franklin. Marjorie Barnard. Hill
of Content. $4.95.
MILES FRANKLIN remains one of
the most mysterious and mystifying, at
once enigmatic and candid, figures in
Australian literature. To make of her
biography, together with a critical de-
scription and assessment of her life
work, a consecutive, engrossing docu-
ment is a tour de force achieved bril-
liantly in this book. Miss Barnard is
both careful and impressionistic and,
like her subject, honest.
At the outset Marjorie Barnard
makes her position clear: she knew
and liked Miles Franklin liking and
admiration survived a bitter misunder-
standing. After the first chapter a
reader will know that what follows will
be as objective as possible, but neither
cold nor dispassionate. I should make
my position clear also: I met Miles
Franklin toward the end of her life
and, unconsciously but typically, she
did me a good turn whose benefits
persist today. I, too, have a special
kind of affection which makes complete
objectivity impossible.
In 1879, when Miles Franklin was
born, there can have been few fifth-
generation Australians. She was one.
This book rightly begins at the real
beginning with those pioneer fore-
bears whose influence was central both
to the novelist and to most of her
novels. The people, landscapes, events,
loves, and disappointments which
shaped and colored her childhood are
displayed both in narrative and quota-
tion from Miles and others. Indeed,
careful and appropriate use of quota-
DiJes
Twokl/i)
tion is one of the chief virtues of this
book.
From her tenth year until middle
age Miss Franklin lived out a series of
exiles. The first was from the high
ranges of Brindabella to the beautiful,
but tamer, Goulburn district. Next
was from Australia altogether to
America, the Balkans as a nurse dur-
ing World War I, and England. These
alienations are well described and their
importance explained. Miles’ middle
years and old age in Sydney are traced
(and splendid photographs very much
enhance the text in this section).
But always, together with the bio-
graphy, march the novels. The Frank-
lin and “Brent of Bin Bin” books are
considered as part of a whole life work
and the “Bin Bin” conjectures described
and, I am convinced, settled for all
time.
There is such richness in this volume,
and so many strands are followed, that
in a review only one of Miss Barnard’s
critical conclusions can be discussed. I
choose her argument that: “[Miles’]
outlook remained that of the 1890s. She
went on fighting old battles . . .
[although] she was neither tough nor
hard.” This point, although only one
of many, does go far to explain some
aspects of the novels and of the life.
But I feel in my bones (an unforgiv-
able admission by a reviewer) that it
is not the whole explanation, even of
the mysteries to which it applies.
On page 51 there is a quotation which
“puzzles” Miss Barnard. In it, and
writing of her agony and the family
uproar after “My Brilliant Career” was
published, Miles writes of the “dubious
guesses” of psychoanalysts. This must
refer to something central and devastat-
ing. I think it is crucial. It remains
to be elucidated.
Following from this I am not con-
vinced that the Franklin attitudes to
sex and “amour” (her word); marriage;
feminism; men as men and fathers, hus-
bands, lovers can all be explained as
stemming from the 1890s. Do they be-
long to an earlier era?. I would guess
that long before “My Brilliant Career”
was published, even long before it was
written, some psychic trauma which we
do not know of (and may never know)
produced its never-ending wound.
As for those absurd exclamations—
the “unhand me, sirs” —“you presume,
Mr. Spires”—the face - slappings and
hatpin - wieldings of outraged virgins—
these seem so directly taken from
journals like the popular “Young
Ladies’ Cabinet” and other magazines
and novels of the 1840s that one won-
ders what that little bush girl, the
“omnivorous” reader, borrowed from
family bookshelves and never forgot
or relinquished. And why? So much
of this was outmoded even in back-
ward Australia before she was born.
A proliferation of mysteries sur-
rounds Miles Franklin, one of whose
great pleasures was, of course, to create
and perpetuate mysteries about herself.
All of these add to the interest and
pace of this excellent book. But per-
haps the most central solutions are
buried for ever in that long ago and
immensely important childhood.

is regarded as a shoddy, foreign, and
suspect mode of life a part of the
bohemian syndrome.
The present competent little study
by three Melbourne social scientists is
a social survey of flat-dwellers in a
huge housing estate built by the Vic-
torian Housing Commission as a part
of its slum-clearance program in Mel-
bourne’s inner suburbs. The tenants
belong mostly to the lower-income
group below SSO a week. The study
surveys in some detail their mode of
existence, their working and leisure
habits, and the way they educate their
children.
The conclusions concerning the
tenants’ dwelling preferences are what
one would expect: the accommodation
provided is superior to anything other-
wise available to their income group,
and it is certainly superior to the kind
of house they could afford, and yet
most tenants would prefer to move into
a house. The main reasons given are
that flat-dwelling is “disreputable” and
that there is too much noise, also in-
adequate laundry facilities. The claims
of some tenants that the education of
their children suffers by flat-dwelling
have not been substantiated.
There is no evidence that flat-
dwelling as such impedes the education
of children or the integrity of the
family. And the flats are certainly not
disguised slums. It appears that given
the disappearance of irrational
prejudices in favor of uneconomical,
burdensome, and culturally debili-
tating “dream-homes” and improve-
ments in noise-proofing, playground,
laundry, and storage facilities, flats
would become an acceptable mode of
living.
“High living” may be the beginning
of an answer to the malignant
spread of Australian cities, inadequate
public transport, and the absence of a
truly urban civilisation.
Lucid pool
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Rock and the Pool. Margaret
Irvin. Jacaranda. $2.95.
MARGARET IRVIN’S FIRST book,
“The Rock and the Pool,” includes
poems written over 15 years and
establishes her as a poet of marked
individuality and range. Some of her
poems have their roots in the Australian
nature lyric of the late ’4os and early
’sos, while others show a contemporary
use of classical myths. The central
theme that emerges, whether in the new
focusing of a myth, the observation
of an object, or the experience of
seasons and states is the search for
timeless significance within time the
pool of the title is “the lucid pool, the
sculptured grove / for which our
contemplation strove.” Water, whether
as pool, ocean, or river, recurs through-
out these poems as the element of one-
ness, protection, and the mirror of
eternity.
Margaret Irvin is essentially a con-
templative poet, and the search for
Margaret Irvin... water mirror
identity leads her to the frail and the
unassertive in nature from which the
lyric has always won its moments of
vision “Citadels” begins “So we are
drawn to what is walled and quiet / and
small, enough for the heart to inhabit.”
Often her words work through sound
and meaning to convey this sense
“wisps of leaves and orchid shells, /
thimbles of moss and thin wildbells.”
The best poems achieve a delicate
balance between the observed object
and its symbolic content as in “Fim-
briaria”
Ten green thimbles rise from the
ground,
and what they are for I cannot tell.
They are somewhere between the
homely thread
and the thread of a note that floats
from a small
and cold green bell.
What bears them up is strong as
flax,
unwound from a leafs twisted
thong.
Somewhere there is a word for this
to weave a pattern, to show a sign
and from that, a song.
The point of this poem, as of “Green-
hood Orchid,” is the sheer thereness of
things in nature. It is part of the
strength of such lyrics that the author
presents these things as they are, with-
out making more or less of them than
the poem itself.
Many of the poems have a strong
intellectual content, but others, such as
“Morning at the Beach,” capture pure
mood and atmosphere with fine verbal
effects “the surf spreads out its strong
white quills/and rushes into flightless
song.” Others, particularly those based
on myths, sustain a brisk, slightly cynical
tone, as in “Cyclops and Galatea”
She prayed to his father, Neptune,
who rolled and roared
through conches of laughter, calling
her dim-wit and fraud.
Even the little waves snickered and
guffawed.
Some of the most acute perceptions
in Margaret Irvin’s poems are related
to childhood the sense of menace
and fascination in “Winter Twilight,”
or the world of lurking terror within
a setting of ordered peace conveyed in
the glacial imagery of “Convent Square
Revisited.” A highly intelligent and
compassionate awareness emerges
throughout these poems.
Restless poet
By MARGARET IRVIN
Bungalow and Hurricane. David Row-
botham. Angus & Robertson. $1.95.
DAVID ROWBOTHAM IS an in-
tensely sincere poet who reacts so
fiercely to cruelty, injustice, or des-
potism that one feels his response to
any wounding thrust produces a wish
for violence. Resignation and accep-
tance, let alone humility, have no place
in his poetry. He adds to this formid-
able attitude a highly developed aware-


“DearMr.Kerr
IYegotit straight now.
M; called
Clarified Butter.
What doldowith it?”
"Well, we're over the first hurdle, aren't we?
Now, what do you do with it? That's easy to
answer. You cook meals that are tastier,
more tender, more digestible than any
you've cooked before. Clarified Butter, you
see, is simply pure dairy butter with the
water, salt and curd removed. It gives your
cooking the natural goodness and flavour of
pure dairy butter—brings out the flavour of
the food itself in a way nothing else can. By
the way, you use Clarified Butter much more
sparingly than other cooking fats and oils;
just enough to cover the bottom of the pan
produces first class results every time. And
you use it at lower temperatures, too. So
you'll find that protein fibres are cooked
more gently; they don’t toughen up. Try this
recipe, it's a good way to get to know just
how much Clarified Butter can add to the
pleasure of eating. (P.S. Sorry to confuse
you at this stage but Clarified Butter is also
sold as Ghee or Butter Oil.)

ness of the past and the future of
ancestors and posterity.
Accompanying the poet’s deeply
rooted sense of history is his sense of
danger and retribution, which runs
through the myth-loaded “The Islands
Of Gold.” In style, this poem and
“The Middle Kingdom” are reminis-
cent of Kipling. Like Kipling, David
Rowbotham is not interested in deli-
cate nuances, preferring strong state-
ment and, very often, the sweep of
rhetoric. At the same time he can be
obscure, and this appears, to stem
from his need to serve rhyme.
“To Saint John The Divine” cele-
brates our almost apocalyptic space-
age. David Rowbotham is again taken
up with the future. From a temporal
point of view he is a most restless
poet, always wanting to be off and
away probing time, past, and to come.
“The Money Spider” and “Spider
And Moth” show the poet’s deft hand-
ling of living minutiae. Both poems
have very attractive endings, the first
being:
Here she hangs, the tint of honey,
To an old wives’ tale of money,
Sweetening an avarice.
And the second:
You made my safest self seem just
a moth.
“The Height,” “The Try,” “The
Hood,” and “The Great Pacific Basin”
are all poems of immediacy, the last
outstanding for its imaginative breadth,
culminating in the terse, metaphysical
couplet.
All we imagine in the blue globe as
it spins
might exactly measure where the
light begins.
Books in brief
Sunlit mystery
Picnic at Hanging Rock.
Cheshire.
Joan Lindsay.
“WHETHER PICNIC AT Hanging
Rock is fact or fiction, my readers must
decide for themselves,” says the author.
A friend in Victoria assures me the
school of the mystery is well known.
Certain other fairly minor matters,
people and places are actual, and
Hanging Rock is a tourist attraction.
What is significant is Joan Lindsay’s
skill as a spellbinding teller of a grace-
ful tale. 1900 is the year; the felicitous
style is reminiscent of Ethel Anderson’s
fanciful recreations of early Parra-
matta; the whole is an enchanting tale
of mystery too light, and even at its
grimmest, too sunlit, to be called
Gothic.
On St. Valentine’s Day, 1900, in Mr.
Hussey’s covered drag, some 20 young
lady boarders from Mrs. Appleyard’s
select Ladies’ College set out for a
picnic at Hanging Rock. Mademoiselle
de Poitiers (French and Dancing) and
Miss McCraw (Mathematics) accom-
pany them. During the afternoon three
senior girls and one junior and, separ-
ately, Miss McCraw set out to explore
the monolith. The junior later emerges
hysterical from undergrowth near the
picnic ground. Her companions and
Miss McCraw have, after some very
strange episodes, vanished.
The novel tells of the searches and
police inquiries of the odd and far-
reaching effects of the mystery on all
concerned from the ironclad Mrs.
Appleyard down to various members
of the “lower orders.”
Other mysteries develop. Just what
impelled the gallant young Englishman
Michael? And what defeated him? How
can one explain Albert Crundall’s
dream, and who w r as Sara the star-
crossed or, for that matter, ner
guardian? As for the white swan . . .
It is all fascinating and exciting, but
a word to would-be cheats. It’s no
use peeping into the last pages Joan
Lindsay’s tight-wrought story is far
too convoluted and ingenious to disclose
its surprises so simply.
Here, as in other recent publications
printed in Hong Kong—printing errors
ranging from hilarious mis-spellings to
very irritating transposed lines are far
too common.

admired, and Conrad envied, the sharp,
detached realism of Becke’s storytelling.
The reputation of this Australian writer
has since receded. In this book the-
American professor A. Grove Day aims
to put “the prince of South Sea
writers” back in the company of these
admirers.
Becke’s life divides up neatly for this
pioneer biography. Professor Day is
direct and economical in his descrip-
tion of Becke’s 20 adventurous years as
an island trader, gold-miner, black-
smith, arms smuggler, and accomplice
of notorious pirate Bully Hayes, then
a further 20 years writing these stories.
His stories are as tough and straight-
forward and somewhat larger than his
life. He was told to write his yarns as
he told them by his only tutor, J. F.
Archibald, co-founder of The Bulletin,
where Becke’s first stories appeared in
1893. James A. Michener, who collab-
orated with Professor Day on “Rascals
in Paradise,” one of whom was Becke,
has said: “Becke was not a liar, he was
a writer. Those who want an evocative,
unpretentious, fearfully moving account
of the Pacific in its heyday must read
Louis Becke.” Professor Day first ex-
amines these most numerous and best-
known yarns of missionaries (for whom
Becke had little regard), traders, and
naval men among the South Sea


Useful introduction
From The Green Antilles. Edited by
Barbara Howes. Souvenir Press.
$3.85.
WEST INDIAN WRITERS have been
a centre of attention for some time
now, and Miss Howes’ purpose in
this collection is to present samples of
the best Caribbean work being written
in French, Dutch, and Spanish as well
as in English. It is an enormous un-
dertaking and “From The Green
Antilles” is intended as a useful intro-
duction for interested readers, and
nothing more. Anthologies consisting of
extracts from novels as well as short
stories are particularly vulnerable to
criticism, and Miss Howes does not
present nearly enough of the rich abun-
dance of Caribbean poetry, though
there are some beautiful extracts from
Aime Cesaire, St. John-Perse, and
Nicholas Guillen. Among the stories
Emilio Belaval’s “The Purple Child,”
an extraordinarily compassionate study
of poverty, and Alejo Carpentier’s
thickly textured “Return to the Seed”
are outstanding.
Superficial run-through
The French Novel Since the War.
Maurice Nadeau. Methuen. $5.90.
M. NADEAU’S BOOK traces the his-
tory of French fiction from the realism
of the immediate post-war period,
Rousset’s novels of the prison camps,
Gayrol’s more poetic and personal
evocation of the same milieu, and the
masterpieces of Sartre and de Beauvoir
(whose “Les Mandarins” remains
grossly underrated and neglected), to
the advent of the “new novel,” the
breakdown of order and balance in
French literature, the painful recording
of alienated emotional states. No more
than a superficial run-through, tired in
its writing, and lacking in any really
striking insights, M. Nadeau’s book is
particularly disgraceful in virtually
ignoring Montherlant, whose post-war
works are not even critically discussed,
in failing to grasp the essence of Giono,
and in (astonishingly) failing to
analyse satisfactorily the precise causes
of Aragon’s role as a national hero.
Strictly for the newcomer; and he must

Islanders. Professor Day writes off the
padding and sentimentality of the
longer novelettes Becke wrote on de-
mand and to support a family, but he
claims that the Bully Hayes and Aus-
tralian . stories belong alongside the
earlier ones.
In assessing Becke, Professor Day
grants his limitations, but emphasises
the strong plots and realistic atmos-
phere. There are enough quotes here
and earlier, notably a magnificent de-
scription of a shipwreck, to win agree-
ment for the claims made and per-
haps enough interest to search out the
yarns themselves.
SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Condemning the
"at home"
business dinner
IN MY LAST column, on November
18, I dealt with the evils of the business
lunch. I made no comment on the
business dinner. All restaurants which
cater for expense-account luncheons
were hot on my tail; even though I
hoped to make it clear that “logic and
lunch don’t have much in common.”
This week,' with no desire whatsoever
to soften the blow or make amends,
I’m coming out hot and strong on the
side of the restaurateur. It is highly
desirable to have business dinners, but
not “at home” business dinners.
The more successful the executive
the more demands are put upon his
personal free time his time at home
when one hopes that the old pre-success
family life is continued. I emphasise
“hopes” because this is so seldom the
case. Often the desire for success is con-
ceived in a desire to provide the good
things of life that will give security and
happiness to one’s wife and children.
After a while the necessary preoccupa-
tion and concentration required makes
one lose sight of the original motive.
Sometimes it is lost altogether, especi-
ally when the good things have been
obtained.
Let me add that if business
dinners become a rule, then the host
and hostess should set out to create an
impression they consider is a good
front. This may lead to employing a
live-in housekeeper-cook or bringing
into one’s home a professional who
designs the menu, buys the food, cooks
the meal, serves it, and does the wash-
ing-up. All very fine and relaxing for the
hostess, but where is the pride, where
is the achievement, where is the crea-
tivity, and, if that isn’t enough, where
is the genuine hospitality?
This leaves me one last apparent
about-face. Why is it bad for one’s
digestion and business acumen at lunch
and yet acceptable at dinner? Basically
because the decision-making machinery
is in full operation prior to and follow-
ing lunch. Dinner, on the other hand,
follows the cessation of follow-through
activities and any proposition can be
introduced with more casual, conversa-
tional overtones. Discussions over lunch,
however, are usually more specific and
the recipient preconditioned by such
statements as “Why don’t we discuss
the contract over some lunch,” or
“We’ll save time and fix this one up
over lunch.” Both statements you’ll
note, over lunch. Although not its
strict meaning, they are dead right—the
talk overwhelms the food.
Finally, in my experience you gener-
ally make a better deal without the
pressure of time recalling you both to
your desks. If just a little of what I
have said rings true, then how can
you be certain that the restaurant is
not going to let you down? Here are a
few points to ensure a successful even-
ing.
• Don’t always select an “in” res-
taurant. That may be popular for good
reasons, but it will also be full, and
full of people both you and your busi-
ness associates may wish to avoid. “In”
restaurants lend much less status than
a small place at which your guest may
not have dined.
• If the dinner is important, make a
point of going a day or two earlier
to meet the owner and the headwaiter.
To be known by name on your arrival
is a distinct plus factor. If you also
know them by their first names, then
you are automatically streets ahead.
• If the party is for six, then a rec-
tangular table is fine. For eight to 12
a round table should be chosen. For
more than 12 you really need a private
room. Several of the better hotels and
restaurants have these at very little
extra charge.
• Ask the owner what his chef most
enjoys cooking. If his answer is accept-
able to you, then ring your guests with
some such statements as, “Have you
had the Braised Guinea Hen at
Beppi’s?” . . . “No, well how about I
order it for our dinner?” . . . “Are you
sure Helen would like it?” . . . “Fine,
see you Tuesday.”
There is good reason for this,
especially if your party numbers six
or more. Each member could order
something different from the menu.
Foods obviously vary in their cooking
time, so you cannot therefore escape
some of the dishes being overcooked,
reheated, or cold. One dish, superbly
cooked, presented on one salver, requir-
ing one wine, simplifies the situation,
and adds credit to you as host. Your
guests obviously select their own first
and last courses.
• You should always pre-order your
wine, especially if it is good and red.
Last week I opened a 1955 St. Thomas
Special Reserve Burgundy. I tasted it
-—it was heavy, acid, and almost un-
drinkable. An hour later, when served,,
it was full, fruity, and magnificent.
• Book on a night when the. restaurant
is not flat out- —Tuesdays and Wednes-
days are good days.
• If possible, don’t mix a business
dinner with dancing or a floor show
this is more properly for entertaining
your guests after you have made a deal!
• Finally always change your venue.
You may think it is good to be known
by your favorite restaurant, but eventu-
ally you’ll bore your wife to death!


LETTERS
Appreciating Mr. Ed
Have recently received a copy of the
October 28 edition of your magazine.
Was pleased to see that this highly
regarded publication carried a feature
article of cur small community’s most
highly regarded citizen, Ambassador to
Australia, Edward Clark.
I must admit that while reading the
first part of the article I was somewhat
disappointed in your evaluation of this
fine man, however, was happy to see
that the author did get to follow
through on his acquaintance with
Edward Clark to understand him as we
in this community understand him a
very sensitive, but sincere, dedicated
man who is not only interested in the
welfare of his country and State but
deeply in the welfare of his fellow-
man.
As one who has known Mr. Clark all
of my life I can truthfully say that I
have never known a kinder hearted or
more unselfish person. The majority of
this man’s waking hours are spent do-
ing something in behalf of his fellow-
man. I think one of the greatest
tributes that can be paid to this man’s
character is to know that he is highly
regarded from the most humble in-
dividual in the backwoods of East
Texas to those that sit in the highest
places of government in our State and
nation.
It might interest you to know that
his mother is still living in this com-
munity and is 87 years of age. The
major portion of her time is still spent
in doing things for those that are un-
able to do for themselves.

Devaluation and shipping
Congratulations on your devaluation
articles (8., Nov. 25), which collectively
constitute the best coverage to be found
in the Australian Press.
About twelve months ago The
Bulletin gave ample warning of this
impending devaluation, but it would
appear that no Treasury action was
taken (a) to safeguard the intrinsic
value of our Australian funds “invested”
in sterling in London, (b) to prepare
for “D” day well in advance.
Also about twelve months ago Mr.
McMahon made his famous “Towns-
ville” declaration to the effect that Aus-
tralia would back sterling to the hilt.
You were kind enough to publish a
letter of mine at the time drawing
attention to this extraordinary statement
by the Treasurer involving as it did our
currency reserve backing, etc. I ques-
tioned whether Mr. McMahon had the
approval of Cabinet for his statement—
now the Treasurer is reported as having
said that the Australian dollar was
nowadays “an international currency
capable of looking the world in the
face.”
What does Mr. McMahon mean by
these grandiloquent words? Does he
mean that the Australian dollar is to
become freely convertible? That Aus-
tralians will be as free to transfer funds
to London as Britons are free to trans-
fer funds to Australia? That the old
wartime restrictive currency regulations
are to be abolished and this socialistic
type of control so dear to Dr. Coombs
is to be abandoned at last?
As the world’s twelfth largest trading
nation (imports and exports) situated
at considerable distances from most
markets shipping freight rates are a
most important factor in our economy.
Slavish acceptance by us of the now
proposed increase in “conference” rates
which are quoted in sterling should not
be countenanced if such is fixed at more
than about half the 14 percent sterling
devaluation.
As regards British-owned ships, there
is certainly no justification for more
than seven percent increase, as the capi-
tal and wage costs remain, of course,
the same as before in sterling and only
some external running costs (e.g., fuel)
may be increased by virtue of the
sterling devaluation.
The Government, conscious of the
difficulties arising to our exports as a
repercussion of sterling devaluation,
should exert its influence at least to
keep freight rate increases to a mini-
mum in both directions but particu-
larly from Australia so that our ex-
porters receive at least the assistance of
lower export freight rates expressed in
Australian dollars. It was not intended
that sterling devaluation should be used
as a means of increasing shipowners’
profits. It is a fact that any increases
in freight rates will undo part of the
good effects of devaluation. This should
not be tolerated by Australia and looked
at askance by the U.K. despite the
eventual benefit accruing from the
receipt of higher “invisibles.”

Shocking the British
I found “Observer’s” comment “Shock-
ing the British Back into their Wits”
(8., Nov. 25) emotional and incon-
sistent almost to the point of
incoherence.
Several Aunt Sallys were set up for
prompt demolition, including: “The
British Government can dump us while
we are supposed to stick to them.” Sup-
posed by whom and in what way and
did devaluation constitute an avoidable
act of dumping?
Britain is accused several times of
being backward-looking: “History end-
ing with Dunkirk, etc.” Surely some of
the moves which appear to upset “Ob-
server” are a response to things which
have happened since Dunkirk. The
application for membership of the
Common Market and support for the
Kennedy Round, and the reduction of
overseas defence expenditure for in-
stance.
These may have adverse effects on
Australia, but on any international
comparison of national standards of liv-
ing, Australia rates more highly than
Britain. At a time when there have
been so many spectacular accretions to
Australia’s national wealth, should
Britain be dissuaded from these moves
so that this relative position can be
perpetuated?
It is hoped “Observer’s” condes-
cension and “holier than thou” attitude
is unintended.
“The good turn of speaking about the
people who run Britain as we find
them.” Presumably “Observer” would
welcome equally frank British comment,
in the context of the Common Market,
pointed and public questioning as to the
fate of the Report of the Government
Inquiry into the Dairying Industry. Or
would this be regarded as an intolerable
intrusion into our domestic affairs?
Inverted snobbery is as useless and
ridiculous as snobbery, and emotional
anti-British outbursts as useless and
ridiculous as extravagantly pro-British
sentiments. Surely we can accept the
fact that Australia is a nation taking its
decisions on such things as devaluation,
capable of benefiting from trade with
and investment from Britain. And that
it is no longer necessary to assert our
independence by volleys of abuse aimed
at our elders.

Nurses ' future
For large city general hospitals the
educational standard of the nurse is
indeed high, and in some it is impos-
sible for an applicant to be accepted if
she is not equipped with a Leaving
Certificate or an equal standard of
education. The statement that the intel-
ligent nurse may have existed in the
past and she is in direct contrast to the
nurse of today is just so much poppy-
cock.
We cannot but agree with some of
the enlightening facts which comprised
your article. There is very little oppor-
tunity upon graduation for the nurse to
find work which is both interesting and
intellectually stimulating. Perhaps the
solution to the problem may be found
in a training course which combines
basic nursing teaching in a hospital,
together with a more detailed and tech-
nical degree course at a university.
However, it is most desirous that
something concrete should be done to
reassess the entire nursing system and
elevate the status of the nurse.
Please withhold our names.

Defending nurses
At least one false statement and
many plausible and cynical generalisa-
tions have misinformed your readers
about the nursing profession (8., Nov.
18), a society which has earned high
repute by service in civilian life and
wartime, and one without which our
society could not function.
The statements attributed to a suc-
cessful general practitioner attached to
one of the largest Sydney Hospitals
display an arrogant attitude of mind
completely at variance with the facts.
This medical man, who obviously
has not taken an active part in the
inner life of a teaching hospital and
training school, and who sees nurses
as “dispensers of pills and bathers of
patients,” unfortunately represents an
arrogant, ignorant, and unenlightened
group who see life in terms of tech-
nology, and cannot appreciate the
qualities of compassion, cheerfulness,
and refinement which make life bear-
able for sick patients. He obviously has
not realised that doctors and patients
alike are dependent at all times on the
integrity, efficiency, training, discipline,
and understanding of the nurses.
I have taught nurses in a number of
training schools and in service life for
25 years. I have the deepest admira-
tion for the profession and for the
cheerfulness, efficiency, and unselfish-
ness with which they manage to deal
with the hour to hour needs of the
sick. I could not do it myself and do
not think that many doctors could—and
certainly no untrained lay-people.
I have known only improvement in
the standards of nursing care over the
last twenty years, which I think is
due in a larger part to a better train-
ing and higher standard of education
of the trainees. I find many of the
very best nurses come from the coun-
try districts, where freedom and under-
standing seem to grow together in a
natural environment.

Your article on Nurses (8., Nov. 18)
quotes a singularly stupid summing up
of the situation, never once setting out
the opinions of a nurse. The doctor who
puts nurses ahead of waitresses is
quite right of course; it is reasonable
to suppose that a mistake that might
cost a 'life is more important than
delivering the wrong color tea. Even
handing out pills to a ward of 50
patients (pills of 50 varieties and at
different intervals) can call for a
little intelligence.
Strangely, a bright academic record
is not always a measure of intelli-
gence. Women often regard the con-
crete as more important than the ab-
stract and human relations more im-
portant than dry as dust poetry by
some dead and dust poet. An Arts de-
gree does not make a practical per-
son. My daughter, with an average
academic record, won several “Case
History” competitions and finished
“Graduate of the Year” in a class of
120, some of whom had higher schol-
astic records - one having a year’s
Medicine at the University. Higher
academic achievement makes a nurse
more impatient with humanity at it’s
most maudlin stage.
A nurse attends many hours of lec-
tures and has three examinations each
year. Sometimes she attends lectures
after a night on duty and all her study
is in her own time. No apprentice has
conditions like this and no unskilled
factory worker has to put this much
effort into her job.
My daughter, having gained her cer-
tificates, and with a useful trade be-
hind her, is now r giving up nursing, not
because there is “little scope for a
bright mind” but because of the sheer
hard work, heavy responsibility; and
unsatisfactory social life owing to bro-
ken time.
While girls can earn an equivalent
living more easily and much more
pleasantly elsewhere, there will be a
shortage of nurses and a wastage of
trained sisters.

Your article illuminating, to some ex-
tent, the plight of the nurse-training
hospitals and the general status of the
profession (or quasi-profession if you
like) certainly deserves comment.
Is it coincidence or typical jour-
nalistic provocation that the article
begins with such a statement that would
surely raise the ire of any nurse, trained
or otherwise, and also, I venture to
say, be refuted by most members of
the medical profession? The unnamed
doctor’s views are so extreme that I
cannot but ask what are his criteria
in other words, what exactly does he
expect from us?
I am not “sounding off” against your
article as a whole —■ indeed in the
old show-business idiom “any publicity
is good publicity.” We NEED re-
evaluation, and certainly a consolidation
of organisation such as your article
suggests. I do, however, feel that it
should have been presented in more
depth, with less emphasis on shock
value. We are indispensable, and we
know it.
But so perhaps are waitresses and
messenger girls.
What motivates a girl to enter nurs-
ing? Analysis of essays written on com-
mencement of training shows a similar
stamp a willingness bordering on
anxiety to help people, a sense of the
worthwhileness of the vocation, and a
realisation, as well, of the more tangible
benefits a job for life, opportunity
for travel, skills which will benefit future
homemaking, and so on.
Now, to mention, as you do, the com-
ment of the recent high-achieving gradu-
ate who stated that she wanted from
now on to do anything but nursing
good heavens, what naivete! May I ask
of my colleagues what nurse, having
just completed three or four years of
quite hard physical work coupled with
the tension of examination preparation,
has not said exactly the same thing?
I speak as a nurse with some ten years’
postgraduate experience, also as a coun-
try girl and a farmer’s daughter. So,
naturally, the criticism of country nurs-
ing students affects me rather strongly;
this particular one is only partly true.
Certainly one must acknowledge that
country girls may apply to a city hos-
pital for training in order to “live it up
and have a ball” (and don’t think
Matrons are unaware of this!). But I
cannot accept the contention that coun-
try girls as a whole have “absorbed a
tough attitude toward living things.”
Indeed, very much the opposite.
I must agree with one of the conten-
tions expressed in the article there is
certainly not enough scope for further
education for the professionally orien-
tated nurse, and for the girl who does
undertake one of the few postgraduate
courses available, not enough financial
or professional recognition. I also agree
with Miss Jenkins that the Nurses’ Final
Examination (in the State of N.S.W.)
is one which could be successfully
attempted by second - year nurses.
Furthermore, of necessity, it is evalu-
ated at a level which allows weaker
students to pass the necessity being,
of course, the desperate need for trained
nurses in the community.

In reference to “What Is the Nurse’s
Future,” I am amazed, as a regular
reader of your magazine, to see that
you have lowered your standards to
print an article which has stated num-
erous allegations completely devoid of
any substantial evidence to support such
gross generalisations.
Those sweeping statements of the so-
called general practitioner in the open-
ing paragraphs, leave much to be
desired. As a university graduate, with
his higher education and position, he
should be a respected member of
society. Unfortunately, he has over-
looked his primary-school logic.
The remainder of the article is
hardly worthy of comment. It would
be advisable that your Miss A. Hersey,
should she undertake any future article
of such a complex nature, could firstly
seek the true facts.

if we knew you were coming...
. . . we’d bake a cake. Because, figuratively, looking at
what goes on inside a cake while it’s baking is like
determining what goes on inside a rubber compound
during its curing cycle.
And everything that happens to rubber during its
cure, all of the processing characteristics, can affect
the end product (just like the burnt bottom on a cake).
That’s why, at Australian Carbon Black, we use this
Monsanto Oscillating Disk Rheometer. This amazing
apparatus rapidly and precisely determines everything
that is happening during cure. Saves a lot of time. And
guesswork. And money. Although we only make carbon
black, an essential ingredient in most things rubber,
we offer the use of our Oscillating Disk Rheometer to
anyone who uses carbon black in his product. We
know it will help in the development of better, more
advanced rubber products for the consumer.
So the next time you think of black, think of us.
It’s our piece of cake.
