If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore

complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made mo thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guirantss a Permanent ana Complete Cure in every case I undertake.
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life*
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark x'opy sediment in

wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general

sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
j) r Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they arc destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

An “Early Closing Bill.”
The ill-shaped, ill-advised, and ill-digested
Early Closing Bill, introduced in the New
South Wales Assembly by Mr. Alfred Allen,
is one of the saddest attempts at democratic
legislation which has been seen during recent
years. Its one redeeming feature is that it
aims a blow at a grievous evil, but the blow is
aimed by about the worst shot in all this
continent, and it misses the mark so hopelessly
that Mr. Allen would do well in future to hit
with the butt-end of his intellect—the other
extremity being practically useless. The fatal
mistake about the Early Closing Bill is that
nobody wants early closing, and the movement
is absolutely of no service to any individual
under the sun. Even the Early Closing
Association —surprising as the assertion may
seem —Joes not want it ; it doubtless imagines
that it does, but if its scheme is ever realised,
it will presently discover its mistake. To all
intents and purposes the hour at which any
man shuts his shop or his warehouse is nobody’s
business save his own, and even if he never
shuts at all, but keeps open continuously from
January to December, he thereby inflicts no
injury on any single member of the community,
save possibly himself. And it is one of the
unwritten laws of every nation, that every man
has a right to injure himself if he pleases—so
long as he does not openly attempt suicide, in
which case a supremely idiotic code sends him
to gaol on what is practically a charge of
being still alive. But the shopkeeper may
damage himself to any extent he pleases by
drink, tobacco, opium, gambling, gluttony, wet
feel, excessive exercise, or any one or more of a
thousand other methods, and his right to
damage himself by keeping long hours in a
stifling shop or warehouse is absolutely incontes-
tible. The privilege of w recking his ow n con-
stitution is inherent in every free and indepen-
dent citizen, and so long as he w 7 reeks nobody’s
constitution save Ins own he is entitled to
defend this privilege to the last, even though
he should swim in blood to do it.
« * *
The evils of the present system require a
different and a much simpler and more effective
remedy. In the great warehouses of Sydney
and every other large city there is growing up
a wetilf tvful pallid race of men and women, who
toil all the day and sometimes half the night
for a meagre pittance, and lead a narrow,
cramped, and unspeakably wretched existence
to pile up the speculator’s profits. There are
few more miserable individuals in any civilised
land than the garish employe in a large city
warehouse. His wages are low because his
hours are long, and as his work increases they
tend lower and still lower. This may sound
paradoxical, but it is based on solid logic. So
long as one man is compelled to do the work of
two, he prevents another man finding the
opportunity to work. The other man’s only
hopes of getting employment lie in offering his
services at a lower rate than the person who
now holds the particular post for which ho
craves, and the present holder’s only hope of
keeping his employment lies in giving his
services still more cheaply than the person who
wants to take his place. Consequently, in those
trades where the hours are longest the w ages
are also loiyest, and the intense competition for
the chance of earning a livelihood makes union
among the employes practically impossible.
* # #
The evil therefore is—not that the ware-
houses of the city keep their doors open
too long—but that their employes are merci-
lessly overworked and miserably underpaid.
The logical remedy lies in an enactment whereby
no shopkeeper shall be allowed to work any
employes more than (say) 48 hours per week,
and w'hen one-half the evil is thus removed, the
other half will presently remove itself. For
under this system the large x’etail warehouse
which now employs, perhaps, 40 workers must
either close earlier or give work to a greatly in-
creased number of wage-earners. And this
same increase in the number of employes will
diminish the great mass of unemployed labour,
and thus lessen the murderous competition
which now keeps salaries down to starvation
level. The advantage of this method of dealing
with the subject is that it attacks the difficulty
directly instead of indirectly. No sane person
ever proposes that the overworked miner should
be relieved by compelling the owner to close his
mine every night punctually at six, or that the
seamen should be protected by an enactment
requiring every captain to heave-to at sunset
and drift about till the ensuing morning. In
these and all other cases, save that of the ware-
house employb alone, the law 7 only attempts to
protect the individual worker, and so long as
lie is not overburdened the hours which his
employer may keep are that particular em-
ployer’s funeral, and nobody else’s funeral
whatsoever.
• * *
The poet Allen’s Early Closing Bill is, in
every sense, a brutally conservative measure,
framed to promote the interests of the large
city shopkeeper, and to ruin the small suburban
tradesman. The patrons on wffiom the latter
relies, are, in a great measure, persons who are
employed in the city during the day, and who
make their purchases after their return in the
evening. If the suburban tradesman is shut up
at an early hour by process of law then a large
number of his customers must necessarily buy
whatever they require in tow'n, and thus the
trade will converge more and more to the huge
“ emporium ” which already monopolises more
than its share. The law 7 might reasonably
require that the small shopkeeper should not
keep his wife, his son, or his daughter employed
more than a certain number of hours per diem,
but it has no right, even in the interests of his
physical well-being, to prevent him employing
himself for seven days and seven nights in the
week if he feels so inclined. By its interference
in this matter it treads on the most sacred right
of man—the right to do himself an injury if he
w'ants to. In theory, no doubt, the employe
also possesses the same right, but in his case the
law is bound to interpose, because it could not
possibly distinguish between the worker w 7 ho
really wanted to toil for 12 or 14 hours a day,
and the one who w as compelled by his employer
to my that he wanted to do so, under pain of
losing his situation. But if the under
the eight-hour system, chose to hold two
separate situations for two separate employers,
and toil for an aggregate of 10 hours daily, that
also is strictly his own concern. The law has
a right to interfere with his liberty so far as is
absolutely essential for his own protection, but
beyond that his right to commit slow suicide
by overwork is absolutely beyond question.
The Legislature has every possible title to pre-
vent homicide—whether by overwork or other-
wise—but suicide is entirely the corpse’s look-
out.
# * m
Mr. Allen’s Bill is framed, as we have
already indicated, strictly in the interests of
the large city warehouses ; the one which The
Bulletin advocates is open to the objection
that it is framed as distinctly in the interests
of the small, and against those of the large,
dealer. The trader who now employs 20
assistants w'ould be compelled, under a rigid
eight-hour system, either to employ 30, thus
seriously increasing his expenses, or to close at
an early hour, and leave the field entirely to his
competitor. Meanwhile the small shopkeeper,
who works 14 hours a day and is his own
entire staff, would go on the even tenor
of his way, and suffer no injury. The
Bulletin freely admits this discrepancy, and
is rather gratified at it than otherwise. For on
genuine democratic principles every man should
be, if possible, his own employer, and the em-
ployer of nobody else; he should reap the
entire reward of his own labours, but should
not be allowed to increase his gains by gather-
ing in the reward of another man’s toil, and
giving him back a mere percentage of it in the
name of wages. It is impossible to hold the
balance absolutely true between the large em-
ployer and the small one, and therefore The
Bulletin prefers the alternative which gives
the advantage to the latter. Moreover, the
passing of a rigid eight-hour law will afford all
the relief required, and beyond that the early-
closing movement is merely a fad and an
excresenee. There is no abstruse moral influ-
ence in it ; the nation will gain no more by
compelling a shopkeeper, under pain of a heavy
fine, to close his door at 6 p.m. than it would by
requiring a private citizen to fasten his back
window punctually at 8. If Sydney is turned
by Act of Parliament a city of the dead
every evening at sunset, and there is nothing
left but gloom and slush and hollow 7 echoes, the
only result will be that the town will be more
dreary,and the inhabitants seventy times more
suicidal than they were before. The Early
Closing Bill, in fact, is a misnomer. What it
should be called is “ A Bill to .create darkness
and utter desolation by night in all the streets
of New South Wales,” and then the title would
express the situation to the letter.
The Maybrick Case.
The cable tells us that the Maybrick murder-
case is about to be re-opened. That is to say, ,
an action is to be brought against an insurance
company Co recover the amount for which the
man alleged to have been murdered was
insured ; and the woman found guilty of his
murder will have an opportunity of giving her
evidence on oath, subject to cross-examination.
However the case goes, Mrs. Maybrick runs no
risk. Her death sentence has been commuted
to imprisonment for life ; and even if the new
investigation conclusively proves her guilty,
she cannot be sent on the gallows. If she
chooses to perjure herself, she can do it with-
out any fear of an increased sentence. On the
other hand, if a case fairly favourable to her is
made out, public opinion will insist on her
release. When you have a little murder-job on
hand, it is a great advantage to be a woman,
provided you are young and handsome, with
wealthy and influential friends. A man in
Mrs. Maybrick’s place, or an elderly friendless
female, would long ago have ceased to trouble
about the justice of the sentence, or about any-
thing else except, perhaps, the misfit of a cheap
Government coffin. Apart, however, from the
lady’s personal attractions and other advant-
ages, there is plenty of justification for
making further enquiry into the facts con-
nected with her husband’s death. It is
quite consistent with the evidence that
she did kill him, but if the jury had
found her not guilty, the verdict would have
been fully warranted by the evidence. The
evidence would support either finding, and the
jury gave the gallows the benefit of the doubt.
« « «
On the 11th May, 1889, James Maybrick
died of gastro-enteritis. A post-mortem showed
traces of arsenic—not in his stomach, but in
the other organs. Arsenic might have pro-
duced gastro-enteritis ; it might have been pro-
duced by other causes. It was proved that for
years he had been in the habit of taking arsenic
in various forms in spite of the protests of his
friends and medical advisers. This would
sufficiently account for the arsenic found in his
body, if there had been no suspicion of murder.
After his death arsenic, solid and in solution,
and in various preparations, was found in dif-
ferent parts of the house ; not hidden, but just
left promiscuously about in bottles and boxes.
None of this was in any way traced to Mrs.
Maybrick. It was not in any boxes or recep-
tacles belonging to her. There was no evidence
that a single grain of it had been bought by her.
Traces of arsenic were found in some meat-juice
that the sick man had been taking, and in a
mixture of glycerine and borax used to moisten
his lips. The prosecution relied on this fact to
prove that he was poisoned with arsenic by
somebody. It should be mentioned that the
ground upon which the Home Office respited
Mrs. Maybrick was that “although the
evidence leads to the conclusion that the
prisoner administered, and attempted to admin-
ister, arsenic to her husband with intent to
murder him, yet it does not wholly exclude a
reasonable doubt whether his death was in fact
caused by the administration of arsenic.” All
the medical evidence concurred in showing that
death might have resulted from some other
cause. It was possible that the arsenic found
in the meat-juice, &c., had been placed there
after Maybrick’s death by someone to whose
interest it was to create suspicion. If there
had been no doubt on this point at all, there
would have been three alternative ways of
accounting for Maybhick’s death. Either he
administered a fatal dose ot arsenic to himself,
intentionally or by misadventure; or Mrs.
Maybrick. administered it to him ; or it was
administered by somebody in the house. The
circumstance that turned the scale against Mrs.
Maybrick was that she was proved to have
been engaged, while her husband was ill, in an
adulterous intrigue with a man named Brierly.
That was pressed by the Judge and apparently
accepted by the jury as supplying a sufficient
motive for the murder. The Judge, it may be
remarked, has since retired from the Bench in
consequence of unkind aspersions upon his
sanity. The jury, so far as we know, are still
at large. A further fact that told against Mrs.
Maybrick was that she had purchased some fly-
papers and soaked them to extract arsenic. She
explained this by saying that she was using it
as one of the ingredients of a cosmetic she had
learnt to make in Germany. The chemist from
whom the fly-papers were bought admitted
that a certain cosmetic in common use did
contain arsenic and other ingredients which
were shown to have been purchased by Mrs.
Maybrick at the same time. The woman
bought the fly-papers openly, at a place
where she was well-known, and had them sent
round to the house. Then she soaked
them in a basin where every tattling
servant in the house could see them, and a
handkerchief dipped in the solution she put in
her dressing-gown pocket. If she murdered
her husband, her modus operandi was
remarkably, stupidly straightforward. Thu
Bulletin takes the opportunity of observing to
any possible advocates of capital punishment
amongst those who have interested themselves
in bringing about this fresh investigation, that
if Mrs. Maybrick had been duly judicially
throttled in pursuance of the verdict, the
mistake, if mistake there be, would now be
beyond the reach of rectification. The gallows
is a tribunal from which there is no appeal.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
One Man, One Vote.
There is evidently going to he a determined
series of hardly - fought struggles before
One - man - one - vote becomes law In either
New South Wales, Victoria, or Qlicelislapd.
The Conservative parties in all these
provinces and the Conservatives ‘'♦♦c the
monopolists, the “Haves” and the “Mean-
to-keeps ” —will strain every power they pos-
sess, legitimately or illegitimately, to defeat
this reform on which the people have set their
hearts, the one reform above all others that has
awakened the sluggish soul of a lately comatose
democracy, and absolutely vitalised, the masses
with an electrically new political energy. The
result in the end cannot be in doubt, but it is
not easy to prophesy the unpleasant incidentals
'-that, will furnish the details of the evolutionary
period. It depends entirely on the Tory ob-
structionists, and the amount of respectful
common-sense they evince for. the inevitable, as
to whether that period shall be evolutionary or
revolutionary. In Victoria, Premier Munro,
who is damned as a democrat by the fact that
after all he is a mere money-changer, has played
the fool with this great question. When his
Legislative Council colleagues ridiculed the
principle of One-man-one-man', Munro had not
the requisite courage to plunge boldly for a
dissolution, and call upon the people to support
him against Upper House obstructiveness. He
actually pleaded with Softgoods Sargood and
Co. to “please, come back to my arms,” and
those jerry-legislators contemptuously did so.
Their next performance was to rub in their
previous insult by converting the measure into
a One-man-one-or-two-votes Bill, and sending
this down to the Assembly for approval.
_ Munro persuaded the Assembly to reject the
Council’s amendment, whereupon Sargood got
the Council to insist upon it. Then Munro
burlesqued the farce still more by inducing the
Assembly to insist upon its rejection; and
Sargood capped the whole screamery by stimu-
lating the Council to again insist upon reject-
ing the Assembly’s insistence upon rejection.
Next, an open conference was proposed between
the two chambers, and pretendedly agreed to ;
and, finally, on the motion for appointing the
conference delegates, the whole Bill was
dropped into the nearest sewer. That was, all
along, its intended fate. Munro is but a
mountebank Premier, and is utterly unfitted
to guide the democracy of an apple-stall. He
is a power in land-booms and building-society
mysteries, but a nonentity in statesmanship.
The New South Wales Government must avoid
the shoals, quicksands, and rocks on which
Munro has steered so artistically. The Govern-
ment of New South Wales is in a better position
for effective action than is that of Victoria,
since the New South Wales Legislative Council
can be swamped with democratic new members,
whereas the Victorian Council claims to be
representative since it is elective. Victoria’s
slower process seems to be to amend the Consti-
tution of its Legislative Council by broadening
the basis of its franchise.
What Her Gracious Majesty Isn’t.
A London weekly repeats the old lie that
Queen Victoria is in the same position as a
hired servant under contract to perform certain
duties. Which she isn’t. In the first place,
she was never hired, she simply succeeded to
the blessed Throne in the usual autocratic
manner, by right of being, so far as people
know, next-of-kin to the “servant” who had
just died. The British Nation didn’t get
Victoria in answer to an advertisement, or
have a character with her, or take her on a
month’s trial. Immediately upon the death of
Silly Billy, his niece brought her boxes to
Buckingham Palace, and issued a manifesto to
the effect that she had annexed the Throne,
and intended to stick to it by the grace of
God. She was no more hired than is an elephant
which strolls into a Rajah’s dining-room and
begins clearing'the table with its trunk. It
is true that she entered into possession of
sundry castles on a fixed stipend of something
less than half-a-million pounds sterling per
annum, but the terms arranged by the Con-
stitution are not so much a matter of wages, as
a safeguard against the possibility of a monarch
attempting to absorb the whole revenue and
put the kingdom in pawn. Moreover, the
Queen has no exact duties beyond the affixing
of her signature to documents, and if she
became afflicted with rheumatism in both
hands the business of the country would be
carried on without her signature anyway.
That the royal lady is not under contract to do
a hundred and one things “ expected of her ”
is proved by the fact • that she hasn’t
done them for the last thirty years,
yet any public endeavour to dismiss the lady-
help would fetch out the military, and the
clamourers for a new “ servant,” or the effusive
yearners for no “servant” at all, would be blown
to everlasting perdition by a whiff of grape.
In other respects, the analogy between V.R.
and a hired servant is deplorably funny. Her
children draw perquisites from the country
from the time they reach their majority or get
married, and so absolutely is she mistress of
the family situation, that Parliament wouldn’t
vote money to support any royal bride or bride-
groom who hadn’t the Queen’s “sanction.”
Nay, if the Shook of Cambridge were to die
intestate his widow would have no claim upon
his property, because his august cousin keeps
her heavy eyelids closed to the fact that he ever
was married at all. The Queen is a social
goddess—a reigning idol set up by the tew at
the expense of everybody. To call her a servant
is an injudicious lie. too, inasmuch as it attracts
attention to the case of America, where the
elected chief steward of the realm supports the
dignity of his great office on £lO,OOO a year,
and calmly opposes, every day of his life, the
pompous imposition practised by monarchs,
with the assistance of high-toned confederates,
self-seeking sycophants and gratuitous snob-
bery, upon European ignorance and credulity.
The State and its Paupers.
It may be mentioned, apropos of the obligations
of the State to its paupers, that Denmark has,
by an Act passed within the last few months,
taken a position on that subject more advanced
than any other country in civilisation has so
far attempted to occupy. The Act provides, in
round terms, that every citizen must be supplied
with the necessaries of life, among which are
enumerated clothing and shelter. This is not
presented as n benevolence or charity, but as a
State duty, obligatory through the relationship of
theStateto the individual. Impoverished person*


oversixty are to receive pensions, ll will be neces-
sary for these to show that they have led honest
lives. In other words, if the fruits of their
industry till that age do not make them inde-
pendent, the State superannuates them, at their
desire, and pensions them, just as in other
countries civil servants are pensioned. At any
earlier period of life impoverished persons may
call on the assistance of the State, but, if after-
wards able to refund, they will be charged the
expenses incurred. In connection witli these a
reactionary principle has been unfortunately
allowed to creep iu. Such recipients are
stripped of their political rights and remain de-
prived of them until they have paid the account
marked against their names. The pensioned
persons are, however, left in the enjoyment
of all their civil and political privileges, and no
doubt the reasoning which lias achieved this
will bring about au early amendment of the
law in respect to the others. On the whole,
the law is, as we said, in advance of all other
poor laws. One detects in it the clear state-
ment of the principle that the relationship
between the State and the individual is that of
a partnership. If the State suffers it can
demand the assistance of the individual; if the
individual suffers he can call on the State. In
neither case is charity or benevolence exercised.
Each has a property in the other.

Confiscation or Compensation.
Dear Bulletin, — You have so frequently of late
been made responsible for my alleged political sins
and I for your opinions that I was not sorry to
see it once more made apparent in a recent issue
that you are political godfather to no man and to
no partv. This in a “ Plain English ” where I am
“slated” for an alleged recommendation of the
Single-tax. Now, as a Socialist, I accept State
resumption of unimproved land values merely as
an instalment of the community’s ultimate appro-
priation of all sources of value and community-
created values. Furthermore, not being quite
certain that this tax would, under the circum-
stances, be equal to revenue requirements, imagin-
ing that it might leave open to some classes of the
wealthy loopholes of escape from taxation, I
desire to see it accompanied by taxes on
absentees and incomes. When you attack con-
fiscation, according to you, the ultimate of
Single-taxism, of the small suburban lot owner,
ere going on to recommend Protection and Land
Nationalisation as a cure for social diseases, your
logic is scarcely up to standard. The suburbanite
whose lot is worth =6lO or £2O per foot would, at
the worst, not be more heavily burdened by means
,of the tax on unimproved land values than he is
mow by present indirect taxation ; it is where
.city blocks run up in value to tens of thousands
per foot that the revenue would be largely bene-
fited by the country’s just appropriation of wealth
directly resulting from the community's! presence
and expenditure. Objecting to “confiscation
as you style it, and apparently declaring that
resumption, preceded by compensation, is a
financial impossibility, it puzzles me bow you can,
in the same breath, recommend Land Nationali-
sation. If you won’t confiscate and can't (I don’t
agree with you) compensate, how are you to
nationalise? —Yours, George Black.
[The Bulletin scoffs at the Single-tax party simply
because that warty has not the courage to define its real’
policy, and therefore the party is a useless encumbrance,
and ‘leads to nothing. This paper never did say
or imply that resumption with compensation was
an impossibility. What it said was that it was
an impossibility under the Single-tax-cum Foreign-
trade policy. The Single-taxers demand that all
taxation should be at once abolished, and the State
should live on rents, and if so it must confiscate or it
won’t have the rents to live upon. If the State gives
compensation, the rents will pay interest for the present
on the debentures issued in payment to the landholders,
and yield a great revenue in the future ; and meanwhile
the Customs and other imposts must pay the ordinary-
expenses of the State as heretofore. The theory that the
small landholder would lose nothing by confiscation,
inasmuch as what he now receives in rent goes in indirect
taxation, was ventilated by a Bulletin correspondent
long ago, but it lias nothing to do with the case—if the
, State is under any obligation to keep faith with the small
landowner, it is under the same obligation to the large
• one, and if the latter need not be considered, there is no
reason to consider the former. The Bulletin flatly
denies having ever advocated landlordism; it denies
■ quite as flatly that it ever failed to support Land
Nationalisation ; and it will never be a party to any
system of confiscation or repudiation whatsoever, for it
.believes in keeping faith even with respect to the very
.worst bargain. The difference between The Bulletin and
ithe so-called Single-tax-party is simply that the latter are
.sold, body and soul, to the party of Foreign-trade
and cheap Chinese and European shoddy, and The
Bulletin isn’t sold to anybody.] ■ ■
A Court of Conciliation.
The South Australian Assembly is fond of
playing at democracy. Its latest move in this
direction is the “ Industrial Disputes Concilia-
tion Bill ” —a curious legislative leap in the
dark which may lead to nothing or to red revolu-
tion, just as circumstances decide. The object
of this measure is to forcibly decide all disputes
between employers and employes. It provides
that all unions, whether of masters or work-
men, must be registered as industrial associa-
tions, and all disputes arising among these
associations shall be referred to the court of
conciliation, whose decision shall be binding on
both parties. What will happen if the unions
refuse to register themselves on these terms is an
open question, and there seems to be no pro-
vision in case of a dispute between a loose or un-
attached employer and a union, or between an
unattached employer and an unattached work-
man. Consequently the benefits—if there are
any—of the proposed system seem to be reserved
for those trades which are strong enough to
unite for their own protection, and the trades
which are not strong enough don’t come in
anywhere. The servant who drudges in a
boarding-house, the dish-washer in the.cheap
restaurant, the woman who sews shirts in the
back-room of a tenement bouse, the ’bus-driver,
and all similar toilers who, simply because they
are weak and disunited, most need legislative,
protection, are left to settle their industrial diffi-
culties in the old way. Their votes are of no
account at an election, which sufficiently
explains the nature of the situation. The court
of conciliation is to consist of three members
nominated by the employers, three by the men,
seven appointed by the Governor, and a
President, at £l5OO a-year, also appointed by
the Governor. The Governor, therefore, runs
the entire exhibition, and, judging from all
past experience, the sort of members that he is
likely to nominate will decide against Labour
iu nine cases out of ten without the slightest
hesitation. What the Governor has to do with
the matter isn’t explained. He is himself a
capitalist; he associates almost entirely with
capitalists ; the capitalistic class has access to
Ids generous red ear at all times, and Labour
has no access at all ; and this gilded autocrat
is to command indirectly eight votes out of
fourteen. As the other six votes will he
equally divided in most cases, and will practi-
cally neutralise each other, the result would be
about the same if the Governor were himself
the whole court of conciliation, with supreme
authority. The new tribunal will be in the
most absolute sense of the term a machine for
the coercion of labour, in the interests of capital,
and it won’t even be a success in that capacity.
Nominally its decisions are to he absolute, but
if either party rejects them the result will be
just the same as if there was "no court at all.
If it gives its award against the employers on
any particular point, they may cheerfully
accept the verdict—and then shut their factory
doors on the plea that business is unprofitable,
and that they have therefore resolved to give it
up till trade revives. This will not be a lock-
out in name but it will have all the effect of
one, and a court can no more compel a man to
carry on a business against his will than it can
seize upon a citizen and make him open a new
factory by force. Similarly, if the decision is
against the men they may also accept the
verdict, hut every man of the affiliated trades
may resign his billet all the same, not by
reason of the original dispute but because he
wants rest and change of air, and may continue
in that resigned state till the masters offer
better terms. No court that was ever heard of
is large enough to block the way when even one
man—to say nothing of half a nation —resigns
his billet in a perfectly laAvful manner. If the
court of conciliation were established on“a fair
and reasonable basis its decisions might carry
sufficient moral weight to have, in most cases,
the force of law, but a court in which a nominee
Governor has eight Azotes out of fourteen
can have no weight at all. It will be despised
by the workers because, in nine cases out
of ten, it will decide against them as a foregone
conclusion ; and in the tenth case it will be
despised and ignored by the capitalists, because
they will have learned to regard it as a machine
which is created solely for the purpose of
deciding in their favour, and when it, by any.
chance, fails to do so they will consider the
verdict to be an outrage. The scheme is so
utterly one-sided that it will be killed by the
force of public contempt iu its very inception.
■ —• ♦
The New South Wales “Criminal Law and
Evidence Amendment Act ” assented to the
other day, contains several bedrock alterations
of existing law. The sixth clause is the most
important. It provides that every person
accused of an indictable offence shall lie com-
petent but not compellable to give evidence for
the defence, and to he cross-examined upon
such evidence, but not as to Ids previous
character or antecedents unless by leave of the
Judge. The former practice was that no evi-
dence as to the prisoner’s character could be
given, unless the defence gave evidence of good
character; but apparently under this section
the prisoner Avho goes-into the box may he
worried as to his prior criminal eccentricities
if the Judge permits the prosecution to take
this line, whether good .character has been set
up or not. The same section makes the husband
or wife of a prisoner “competent but not com-
pellable” to give evidence for the prosecution
or defence upon any charge. These two altera-
tions constitute a mild revolution in the law,
and their effect will be worth watching. Sec-
tion 4 is in place of the Act of 1884, and goes
further than the latter statute, which was
passed to mitigate the brutality of the Act of
’B3. This section abolishes the former mini-
mum, so that as the law now stands a Judge can
sentence to ten minutes imprisonment a prisoner
convicted of a felony for which penal servitude
for life could be awarded under the C. L. A.
Act, and for which the minimum penalty under
the’B4 Act was three years penal’servitude.
Thus by slow degrees does N.S. W. shake off
gome of the t shackles of the Botany Bay regime.
The case of James Green, who, the other day,
received a sentence of seven years’ imprison-
ment at Adelaide (S.A.), affords a fair example
of the way the nineteenth century Christian
lends a hand to a fallen brother. About six
months ago Green finished serving a term of
imprisonment for his first offence against law
and respectability. We have forgotten the
exact nature of the unpleasantness which arose
between him and the code of his native land,
but that is a mere detail, and doesn’t affect the
case. He tried to obtain work, and failed, and
then he lighted out for Melbourne in the hope of
better fortune. In less than 48 hours after his
arrival there he received from the police one
day’s notice to quit, as being a person “illegally
at large within the colony.” This action
was reasonable enough, for when discharged
criminals from Melbourne drift to the other
provinces they are promptly sent back,
and Melbourne must either follow suit
or else become a refuge for the offenders
of all Australia —but it was woefully hard on
Green all the same. He got back to Adelaide,
and applied to the Discharged Prisoners’ Aid
Society, but though the secretary took him
round among all the labour-offices and the lead-
ing employers, there was no demand for Green
anywhere. The business of the society is to
find employment for discharged prisoners, but
if no one will employ them the value of the
organisation and its secretary doesn’t seem to
amount to much. Then the police ran in
Green for “having no visible means of sup-
port.” As he had not the slightest chance of
getting any “visible means” the case was suf-
ficiently clear. The prisoner offered to prove,
by means of the aforementioned Aid Society,-
that he had done his utmost to get
work, but the court had nothing to do with
that; he hadn’t got the work, and so lie
was duly sent up for three mouths. When he
had finished this experience he went to Broken
Hill, but partly through general depression and
partly through the police having an all-seeing
eye upon him, he failed once more. The one
piece of good fortune which befell him was that
he got away without being again arrested for
want of “visible means,” and that was all.
Finally he got back to Adelaide, hungry and
stone-broke, and fo* want oPffiiy other resource
he decamped with a bagman's samples, and the
proceedings concluded as already stated, with a
sentence of seven years, at the end of which
time Breen will doubtless find all his old ex-
periences awaiting him once more. He will be
a good deal older then, and a good deal more
hopeless, and a good deal better known to the
police, and things generally will be a good deal
harder than they are now, but otherwise the
world will he just the same.
Before Judge Boucaut, at Adelaide, a youth
named Saunders was tried recently on a charge
of criminal assault upon a child of six, and was
sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and one
Hogging. The prisoner was one-half unlettered
barbarian and one half imbecile. He had lived
all his life in the bush, and could neither read
nor write. He was utterly guiltless of every -
variety of knowledge, save possibly a casual
'acquaintance with bullocks. He knew nothing
of the world outside his own little patch of
bush, and was ignorant of religion or of the
existence of a God —in which respect he and
the court seem to have been very much alike,
for if the latter institution knew anything of a
God it didn’t act up to the character.
The prisoner didn’t even know Ids own
age, but imagined he was about 1(5.
To all outward appearance 13 would have
been nearer the mark. Neither of his parents
turned-up to say or do anything on his behalf ;
he was friendless, penniless, undefended, and
unspeakably ignorant and helpless. The pro-
ceedings were about as one-sided as if a horse
or a dog had been in the dock instead of an
alleged human being. The miserable wretch
was the hopeless victim of circumstances from
the beginning, and J udge Boucaut being the last
circumstance he encountered, he became his
victim in turn. Saunders will be benefited by
10 years and a flogging, just as much as an
ourang-outang would be, and no more. He
might possibly be reclaimed by education. If
he is too dull and brutish for education he
might reasonably bo put in confinement
as a being who could not safely be left
at large. But in either case the flog-
ging is an unspeakable brutality—inflicted
on an utterly unreasoning being. It will not
educate him. It will not make him any the
less dense and imbecile. It will serve no pur-
pose at all, in fact, save that it will make the
brutal professional religionist of South Australia
feel better. There is a satisfied glow about the
ordinary aggressive holy man’s waistcoat when
he has flogged anybody, and he goes to church
in a more satisfied spirit after the ceremony.
And though Saunders is the poorest and mean-
est kind of victim that can well he imagined,
the genuine, cast-iron pietist would rather flog
an imbecile boy than not flog anybody at all.

The manifest injustice of sending moneyless
prisoners to the Supreme Court, where, under
existing conditions, they can only be defended
by counsel, is very forcibly shown in the case
of sharebroker Bybus, of Sydney. He has been
sent for trial on five charges at Quarter Ses-
sions, and on one charge at the Criminal Court.
At the Q.S. a solicitor can appear for an
arraigned man. Pybus, having no funds to fee
a barrister, applied to have the single case post-
poned until after the Q.S. cases. The Judge
refused, but said he would consent if accused
would swear that certain books were wanted.
This was done, and even then Acting-Justice
Murray “ took time to consider." Now, what
reason is there, apart from the fact that
the barristers and Judges are members of a
tyrannical trades-union, that Pybus should
not be defended by his attorney in
the Supreme Court? And, further, as the
State in New South Wales only pays, and then
most meagrely (though The Bulletin grate-
fully acknowledges the democratic advance in
this respect made under the regime of ex-
Attorney-Ceneral Simpson) for defence in capi-
tal cases, should not a man whose liberty or
life is threatened by the law be privileged to
nominate any person whom he chooses, lawyer
or non-lawyer, to defend him at the bar ?
Another Sydney lawyer has associated
Avith a defici t of about £30,000 of other people’s
money. This may cause him to lose the friend-
ship and respect of some of his clients, but lie
won’t be put to any further inconvenience in
the matter. Those who live by the law never
suffer by the law. They just embezzle, steal,
defraud, and rob, and when they have taken
the last copper from their last client, the Full
Court strikes them off the roll, and they retire
from business and have all their time tree for
Bible-reading and other popular recreations.
If a lawyer were to rob a stranger in the street
he might have some police-court trouble about
it, but he is never brought up to answer for any
forgery or other irregularity affecting a client.
Once there was a legal fraud called “ benefit of
clergy,” which saved parsons from prosecution
on any charge, but this was taken away from
them, and since then parsons have, as a rule,
been a trifle more honest. But as lawyers still
have a similar “ benefit,” they can, so to speak,
deadhead the criminal law, and the result is
that they are often a trifle more larcenous than
hoodle-bauk directors. A youth who ambitions
a career of felonious annexation of other people’s
money errs in seeking the position of teller in a
straight bank, or director in a-crunk one. He
should become a “ gent, one,” &c. He will
then be able to steal ten times as much, and
need not bother about clearing out to Honolulu
when he has made his fortune.
The Victorian Bible-in-Schools League mainly
consists of parsons—who find that they long-
ago cat off their noses to spite their faces They
allowed the absolutely secular Act to pass
under the impression (as per Minister Stephen’s
memorable declaration at the time) that it
would destroy the Catholics, and they frus-
trated Higinbotuam’s Bill of 18(58, which
offered them the exact tiling so loudly clamoured
for now. But an extra difficulty arises to-day
in the determined opposition of the teachers,
Avho see plainly enough that any man of inde-
pendent spirit will be undermined by Bible-
reading in his school. According to the League’s
proposal, each teacher is to be forced to ladle
out chunks of Scripture, and is to be dismissed
should he venture on t he least scrap of explana-
tion—for otherwise such would range from life
Voltairean to the Muggletonian. Naturally the
child would look for explanation to its teacher
on introduction to the most awful mysteries
conceivable, but the teacher is to be padlocked.
The Bible-in-State-Schools League will fail
dismally, for its objects are utterly repugnant to
the Indifferentist Voting Power which has been
brought into existence by the Frankenstein’s
monster of southern sectarianism.
Sydney Daily Telegraph is the most hum-
orous idiot of the New South Wales press.
One of its latest exhibitions of unintentional
naivete is an editorial on “ The growth of
Reciprocity,” in which its mental confusion
declares (italics ours);
Under the new title of reciprocity a freetrade move-
ment, stron”- and universal, lias begun,' which, it tuny
safely he predicted, will end before long in the abolition
of protective duties, if not in the complete overthrew if
the Custom-house.
The D.T. next proceeds to stand on its own
head and tell us about American tariff recipro-
cities, how—
What was aimed at was the re-estahlishment of free-
trade relations with other countries under compulsion
from the U.S.
The commercial alliance proposed between
Austria, Germany, and Italy is also utilised as
an example of “freedom under compulsion,"
and the whole inconclusive conclusion is that
reciprocity is freetrade and freetrade is recipro-
city ! Now, of course, anyone can see that a
freetrade country cannot, under any circum-
stances, offer reciprocity to another country ;
it has parted Avith all its reciprocal powers, and
has nothing to give in exchange for commercial
favours. Cidy protectionist countries can oiler
and give reciprocity, for reciprocity is a child
of protection, and a sworn foe to freetrade. it
was left to the D.T. madman to discover that
an open and free port to all-comers could offer
further and special and reciprocal advantages
to some of those comers. It is equivalent to an
unarmed man promising not to lire off guns he
hasn’t got, provided the well-armed invader
doesn’t fire off those he has fetched along with
him.
Bishop Saumarez-Smith, Anglican Primate of
Australia, boasts in a modestly holy way that
he refuses, on a high moral principle, to pay
any cabman more than his legal fare of one
shilling per drive from the Macleay-street
stand, Potts Point, to any part of Sydney that
can be reached within a quarter of an hour.
Both the Sydney morning dailies congratulate
his reverence on Ids sturdy inflexibility, and
denounce the cabmen for bolting from the pat-
ronage of the Bishop, who “obeyed the law.”
Now, this cheap and hollow profession of
exaggerated respect for the law is merely an
appeal to mean men’s stinginess. The law is
often tyrannical in its incidence, and it should
be the habitual delight of a Christian bishop to
recognise the special features of a hard case,
and to deal with a cabby as a man and a
brother. To speak of over-payment as “ encour-
aging extortion from others not able to afford it.
does not come within the bearings of this ease.
If Bishop Smith or others can’t afford to pay a
remunerative cab-fare, why take a cab at all?
Threepenny ’busses pass the very door of the
Episcopal Palace, and afford every scope for
the exercise of that “ thrift ” which Tory poli-
ticians want to enfranchise specially. The
Bulletin knows the locality in question, and
the routes that form the subject of the com-
plaints. A cabby has to drive down one
ghastly precipice and up another, and it is a
disgrace to a country which is supposed to have
a national fondness for horses, that it should he
within the power of any fat man to be able to
compel a horse to be driven 1 mile 38 chains
over such an ugly route in eight minutes
for four threepenny pieces. Mark you.
the good Bishop always hires his cab “ou
time.” This, in reality, means—the better the
horse the worse the payment; the more the
cabby takes out of the horse, the less compensa-
tion lie gets. If the horse drawing His Crease
-were made to dawdle, say by walking him
carefully down the steep, so as to safeguard Ids
knees, and so as to exceed the regulation quar-
ter-of-an-hour, the economical and law-abiding
Bishop would have to part a second silver coin.
The Bulletin feels that if, under similar cir-
cumstances, it refused to pay a cabby at least
twice as much as does Bishop Smith, it could
never again look a respectable horse in the
face.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Dec. 30, 1891.
My Dear Moorabinda, —
“ Sassiety ”in Australia does most things according to
the laws of hippodrome, and you can’t help standing
aghast at the way in which “Home” customs are stood
on the'r heads by local “swells” who yet pride themselves
in doing what the dear English do. Two great cards are
the army bride cutting the cake with the martial sword,
and the naval bride getting hauled along by poor Jack.
But the English army bride doesn’t grab Gussie’s sabre
with visibly hardened muscles, and wreak business-like
havoc in the middle of the sun-baked mound of grit and
lemon-peel while strong men wonder at the way she
balances it —that is only the Australian method. Theshe-
Britisher lightly touches the handle while the groom
supports the weapon with which she butterfly-taps the
pastry in the centre, and it at once falls in slices, having
been built that way by the cook. But the most grotesque
parody of English manners occurs when the seamen
harness themselves to the wedding-chariot outside the
city church and tug the ’appy pair through the grinning
streets to the railway-station among the witticisms of
cabmen, ’bus-drivers, and so on. You are sometimes told
by the bride’s mother (who sometimes has an uncomfort-
able doubt about the modesty of the procession) that it’s
quite the English style, to which you hypocritically
assent, but who ever heard of a swell-bride (except she
had the misfortune to be a Roj'al one) being rushed round
London by a two-legged team ? The correct style across
the pond is for the men to draw the bride and srroom
through the ancestral grounds to the front gate, and on
the high-road the horses are put in. But there !no
sensitive person needs to be told that a hired brougham
rushed along by grinning tars and swarmed after by a
crowd of rapscallions as if it were a fire-engine is the very
last spectacle you might meet in Piccadilly.
Seeing that the hot weather has exorcised nearly all our
“representative” families from “taoun” asusual, itdidn’t
surprise me in the least to find oceans of room on the
Members’ Stand on Summer Cup day at Randwick, There
were no hall-marked bona-fide fetishes on view 7, either.
The Jersey cage was a howling wilderness where all the
mats were turned upside-down, and had it not been for
Lord Precedence Scott, who is as socially effective on an
occasion of this sort as the whole mob of dignitaries to be
prayed for in the back end of one’s prayer-book, I don’t
know 7 how I should have summed up the gathering. As
for “pink muslin particulars”—! should have had to
stretch a point if I furnished any. There were no clothes*
( don’t mean in the restricted first-parents sense of the
term (had Society come out in the prehistoric fig-foliasre,
what a lot of fashionable intelligence I should now b e
giving you as to how much of Mrs. de Snooks’ lovely
Agger is hung up on a peg with her gowns, and whether
Percy de Vere's square shoulders are virgin cork) but that
nearly every garment had left the stocks with the first
flower of Spring and looked like it. Another wearisome
feature was the dearth of grown-up men—six togged-out
females hanging on to the skirts of one hobbledehoy was
the order of most of the parties which skirmished in quest
of four o’clock tea.
But altho’ the dressing didn’t deserve three cheers, one
noticed fluttering up and down the lawn to the pom-poms
of the wind-instruments, Lady Charles Scott in navy-blue
silk over a skirt panel of white embroidered satin, front
of bodice of white satin, with a sash tied on the left side,
saggy black hat trimmed with feathers ; the very latest
bride married in England, proudly escorted by hubby
(who has given up playing cavalier servants to this and
that footlight divinity), wearing a black silk gown with
a chow stripe and front of turquoise-blue, hat en mite.
A water-side belle finished a costume of pink figured
muslin and pink chiffon hat and parasol with a pair of
pink boots. It looked from a distance as if she had started
in a hurry and forgotten to drape her pedal extremities,
and she appeared as if wading about the lawn. The most
decent garment on view was black fisher’s net, contrasted
with apple-green silk covered with net, deep basque of
fine black lace with a setting of black jet, wide black hat,
with touches of apple-green and swarms of pink roses.
There were few really new styles. One or two tinsel and
jewel-covered cuirass bodices made you think the panto-
mimes had got loose, and there was a tendency to let
your dressmaker riot over your outer garment with
quantities of four-inch-wide ribbon. A device suggestive
of Jack the Giant-killer’s way out of the porridge-difficulty
seemed new. It was a sizeable bag, fixed on with chains
hanging directly in front of the wearer, and if you could
get along sometimes without mistaking it for ogrt of your
anatomy, it might have its advantages.
Let me trace the epitaph of the second and last day of
the Summer race-meeting at Randwick in dust and
ashes—so far as fashion goes. Lines of forsaken benches
on the Members’ Stand—though every other portion of
the course seemed a tight fit for the rush of horsey
humanity—but in that sacred rallying place of sassiety
before mentioned there was an Ichabodish air all day
which quite dulled the proceedings. Yet the desolation
had one comfort in it for the women who were on view
they stood out so—each one was literally a silhouette.
Among this scattered remnant Mrs. Arthur Allen, in
blue-grey figured gown with pleated white straw vest and
belt of silver sequins, wide black straw disc hat trimmed
with black wings and blue chiffon ; the pretty daughter
of the Clerk of Parliaments, in a dreamy frock with sap-
green silk in its composition and a rustic hat with poppies
and cornflowers ; Miss Dangar, in a white gown and black
crinoline straw* hat, were the most soothingly attired on
the Members’ §tand. On the Grand Stand I espied a very
pretty gown. The main idea was shell-pink with a beau-
tiful brocade of little bunches of damask roses and leaves
in natural colours all about it at odd intervals; the
“fuss” at neck and sleeves, and so on, of pink em-
broidered chiffon ; flat hat trimmed with roses and chiton
(M suite —really it looked ouite Melbourne Cup-ish.
Ex-explorer Stanley ought never to go a-walking with
Ins wife, for she is a head and shoulders above her hero,
and has a masterful way of clutching him by the arm, as
determined mothers do while they are‘‘skull-dragging”
Johnny unwillingly to school—but perhaps Henry’s
recent accident has something to do with the way his
spouse hoists him along. The illustrious couple did the
big Centennial Park thusly one day last week, little Mr.
S., with his baggy grey suit flowing in the wind, and his
speaking visage buttercup-yellow in the afternoon sun ;
his bride fluttering in a light muslin gown, with butter-
cup-pink rosebuds upon it, a big black hat, and a cream-
spot veil shrouding her rosy cheeks, tiny yellow gloves,
unfastened at the wrist, one of which clutched the
explorer—as above stated —near the region of the armpit.
They stayed in the Park for some time, and paced the
asphalt, talking earnestly—about the Congo governorship
maybe, which is the stock difference in the Stanley house-
hold. Mrs. S. won’t hear of it, and Mr. S. wants to go.
,, lere are vnilcs of sight-destroying dazzle in the
Thirty-and-ten Thieves,” but I am not going to describe
the show' from a wardrobe-mistress’ point of view. Rose
Hearing-a regular-profiled lady from London with a
small, sw'eet voice that smites you like the upbraidings
of your own conscience and an aggravating pas seul
reminiscent of Nellie Stewart before she seriously learnt
to kick spiders off the ceiling—wore two verj' artistic
costumes. Firstly, pale - pink skirtlet shrouded in
chiffon, the bodice entirely of silver ; secondly, buttercup
yellow 7 , the skirt covered, of course, with cream crfipe,
the whole toilet ribbed with gold spangles ; yellow hose
and shoelets. Pattie Browne, whose “Ganem” lacked
boyishness no boy ever folded two delicate white hands
holding a lace handkerchief just two inches below' his
waist—looked best in the pale-grey and w'hite suit with
white pom poms round the jester sleeves, and in the
heliotrope tights and long brocade cloak of the last act >
but the “supes.” rule the picture so far as colour goes.
Nothing could be more warmly artistic than the dressing
of the Forty Thieves proper. Grey plush and satin ; silk
tights and silver, the cloaks lined with forest green ;
golden satin and brown velvet cloaks ; the bodices of
cream satin designed in brown and much gold tinsel.
The graceful quartette of singer-dancers looked prettiest
in the green silk accordeon-pleated Empire frocks over
coral-pink silk petticoats beautifully braided.
Lady Charles Scott’s fotc ohampetre of Wednesday last
week was modelled on every other official garden-party
that ever was, except that the hostess received her guests
in the drawing-room instead' of in the most convenient
paddock, as the Jerseys and Hopetounsdo in order to
keep the marauders off the carpets. To the strains of the
flagship-band the visitors dawdled in the Shady grounds
overlooking the hide-warehouse, wearing their most
summery attire, for the day was a day that turned the
mercury into a skyrocket and the ices tearfully dissolved
on the verandah buffets. Lady Charles Scott wore a
cream gown with garniture of wisteria ribbon—her sister,
who helped her in the onerous task of entertaining,
looked cool in a white India muslin gown fairy-fled with
lace and chiffon. *
The sacred concert held at Her Majesty’s on Christmas
Night under Mr. Charles Huenerbein’s aegis suffered
because the leading singers—Annis Montague, Charlie
Turner, Mrs. Riley, &c.—had been helping masses along
all day, and when they took to the stage at night their
vocalisation w-as as cloudy as if they had lacked the will
to renounce the Christmas feasting in the sacred cause of
voice-production. Annis Montague especially was in very
small voice and was scarcely audible in parts of “ I Know
That My Redeemer Liveth.” When a singer exaggerates
pianissimo it seems as if he or she was graciously obliging
the company from a balloon bn the roof. Then the male
song-bird of the occasion warbled like a man mentally
occupied in counting his creditors all over the house, and
the new mezzo-soprano, Miss Young, sang “Jerusalem”
in a pleasant voice marred by a little way she’s got of
half-turning on her ankles from side to aide like an unde-
cided weather-vane. Classical instrumental items were
supphed by Miss, Lottie Hyam (in a handsome gown of
eau-de-m! silk and lace), Rivers Allpress, and Strauss. Ba-
the way, as somebody applauded the gifted trio for a
severe movement from something or other, a small voice
from very high up remarked despairingly—“ Oh, ’old yer
row! There’s lots more yet.”
Two male patrons of the drama, who found their places
jumped at Sydney Royal pantomime on Boxing Night,
had a patent of their own for unfixing the illegal holders.
They just walked in and sat peacefully on the knees of
the ghouls in possession in a confident way that the most
assured engaged girl might have taken a pointer from,
but somehow' or other the men underneath objected to
being made a joint stool of, and got away breathing
horrid vengeance. It was an effective plan, and I suppose
if the jumpers had been women, the rightful holders
would have just reversed the order of things, and taken
the ladies on their “laps” instead.
A crowd surging from floor to roof filled Her Majesty’s
on Monday night in the picturesque pantomime, “ Babes
in the Wood. The “Babes” ought to be a happy
hunting-ground for anybody who is puzzled how to dress
Tommy or Maria for the costume ball—the quaint doll’s
house scene especially, where there are little ones dressed
as Punch and Judy, Simple Simon, Dutch Peasants, &c —
but the most novel and engaging were the little wooden
dolls. The bird ballet is another pretty feature—the
white cockatoo and the little Robin Redhearts turning
out very bird-like. There is clever dressing everywhere
Miss Bashall (from ’ome) wore spiff frocks all the time
but I thought the pale-blue ottoman satin Empire gown
with big sash of grey velvet and long sleeves of latticed
ribbon velvet topped by a flat grey hat, trimmed with
pale-blue and grey feathers, the most soul-satisfying
effort. And Maggie Moore, as “Robin,” absolutely
dazzles one in the heliotrope and silver suit of the last
riotous tableau.
Miss White, eldest danghter of Hon. R. H. D. White
M.L.C., had a pretty wedding with the youthful-looking
v Andrews, Carrington (New-
castle.) The bride was in corded silk, her two brides-
maids in cream with big hats and feathers. The sacrificial
feast was laid out at Lochlee, the residence of the bride’s
father.
A recent wedding was that of Miss Elsie Cowper,
daughter of Sheriff Cowper, of Sydney, to Mr. A.
Buchanan, at Sydney Anglican Cathedra], on 23rd ult.
The leading lady was a picturesque offering on the altar
of matrimony, in a white silk gown, of artistic cut, and
Gainsboro hat, weighed down with feathers—her brace
of bridesmaids m white and pink. Breakfast and the
usual reception at the paternal residence, after which
honeymoon at Mount Victoria. ’
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

George Gordon excels in pantomimic
scenery. Specially may be praised, the opening
view of a mushroom glade, flooded with Tartarean
glow ; a view of Mt. Olympus and the Temple of
Terpsichore, with a botanic foreground in which
40 silver-winged nymphs, bearing silver lyres, and
a corps of children holding silver branches, per-
form the first grand ballet; the “Grand Bazaar
at Bagdad,” an Eastern street scene of oriental
splendour; fairy woodland glimpses and the
interior of the robbers’ cave in the second act, the
dazzling feature of which is the review in shining
armour of the Forty, brilliant in orange and gold;
and the final palace entrance scene, where all
previous promenadings are out-processioned. As
the story ends in poetic happiness, the transfor-
mation scene Unfolds itself, being heralded by
four pictorial allegories, representing Earth, Air
Fire, and Water, and melting into a series ol
artistic bowers, each the shrine of a flowerland fay

Of the specially-engaged artists, “ the.
world-famous wonderful Graggs,” a troupe of
seveh acrobatic performers, are the sensation of
the season. Nothing like their tumbling feats has
ever been previously witnessed in Australia. Back
somersaults from shoulders of one to shoulders of
another, piled up human ladders of three, double
somersaults from crazy eminences to other crazy
eminences, are simply commonplace acts with the
Graggs. The Almonte troupe of pantomimists,
Charles, Ted, and Will, are chiefly in
evidence in the harlequinade, which is thus
rendered unusually lively. Ted is also a versatile
donkey, who can seemingly do everything that a
well-bred ass should do, except bray. The “Fairy
Four ” are song and dance artists of high merit,
Amanda Noel, late premiere danseuse from the
Alhambra, London, has justified her reported
reputation as a queen of poise and gracefulness.
Rose Bearing, a burlesque star, as Morgiana,
proves herself clever and winning. Fred. Mason,
a vocal comique, is an original oddity as Ali
Baba.

Pattie Brown’s reappearance in burlesque,
after seven years’ absence and partial devotion to
comedy, is welcome. Her Ganem is attractively
bright, and her song, “ The ‘ rather ’ Girl ” is well
received. Jennie Opie, as Abdallah, looks a
robber chief all over, and gives, with fine, deep
voice, the robbers’ drinking song, “Sparkling
Wine.” John Gourlay is Hassarac, the gore-
thirsting, unrepentant villain of the tangle, and
he has ’em all on. Throughout, he is as full of
business as a gorilla in a fiery furnace. Harry
Shine, as Cogia, makes a matrimonial horror, who
coolly puts one of her own brats through the
mangle and hangs him out on the line. James
Wilkinson, as Cassim, is seen occasionally, and
has no vocation to do anything. Amy
Johns is the Fairy Queen, Florabella, and has
Miss Watts as her seconder, and Louey Emery as
the Fairy Bobby. R, E. Watson is Zaide, a
negress shriekist.

George Rignold grabbed Christmas Ev e
by the ragged forelock by producing at He r
Majesty’s, Sydney, something labelledßabe B
in the Wood, Bold Robin Hood and his Eorester 8
Good,” that would seem to be an autobiography*
it having been “ written expressly for this
theatre ” by one of the Babes in question, and
provided with ballet gear by both. Like most
autobiographies it is defiantly unhistorioal, knock-
ing two legendary fictions into one impossible
dovetail, and proving generally that an auto-
biographer cannot be believed on his oath. Robin
Hood wasn’t one of the robins that furnished the
benighted Babes with cabbage-leaf bedclothes • he
was built to order for Maggie Moore, whose chief
business in the play is to biff the Wicked Uncle in
the nose, to chouse him out of his ward and sweet-
heart, and to look as unlike a male robber-chief as
is possible for a shapely, bustful female in tights.

The scenery is by Clint and Owen, who
are more than usually successful in three forest
scenes, “Under the Greenwood Tree,” varyingly
attuned to the seasons of Autumn, Winter, and
Spring; a cornfield exterior of Sherwood Castle
with a sylvan background ; and the “Fairy Dolls’
House and Toyland,” hung with cartoon portraits
of well-known N.S.W. politicians.

Maggie Moore. >s Robin Hood, has been
thunderously received, and is in capital voice.
Bella Bashall, as M&ld Marian, made her first
.-uUey to a on Christmas Eve
hum which time she has fairly danced herself into
popular graces. The wicked uncle. Sir Rupert
de Guile, is undertaken by George P. Carey, who
hires two amateur burglars, Roger Ruthless
(Frank Hareourt) and Timothy Trembline
(Martyn Hagan) to murder the Babes (Frank
Ayrton and Madge Seymour). Hagan is full of
spicy business, and his medley of songs is a decided
mighty hit. Gussie and Flossie, the Babes, are
loaded imps of mischief always at full cock, and
ought to be ruthlessly murdered off-hand.
Their escape is undeserved luck. Joe Tolano gets
a brief glimpse of the audience from within his
•disguise as a Scotch nursery governess, but he is
compensated in the harlequinade. Leslie Brothers
ape flunkeys with nothing particular to recom-
mend them, but their especial chance comes in an
interpolated musical melange with cornets, pan-
pipes, ophicleides, saxophones, and other instru-
mental atrocities. J. W. Sweeney, as Friar Tuck,
is so loosely vast in girth, and so vastly “tight”
in condition, that he deserves immortality for the
heroic manner in which he contrives to keep,
amid hurricane surges, both his bottle and Ins
balance. Rosa Conroy, as King Envy, seems
somehow more delectable than Bessie Rignold, as
Fairy Goodheart ; probably she is nicer because
she is naughtier. The ballets and choruses are
effective, and the costumes throughout elaborate
and splendid. As Nat. Gould did not
overstrain his gigantic brain. Frank Eugarde is
responsible for the mostly tuneful music.

John F. Sheridan’s Vienna Summer Gar-
den in Darlinghurst Hall, Sydney, is a possible
Solution of the problem—how to put in a pleasant
and cool few hours these hot evenings. The
nightly programme has a broad range of variety,
and includes performances by such special artists
as “Bridget O’Brien, Esq.,” Gracie Whiteford,
Maude Leamington, the Blair Sisters, and
Amanda Corcoran; Mildred Trigge, danseuse ;
the Bovis Brothers, vocalists and step-dancers;
R. N. Nitschke and Jules Simonson,'vocalists ;
Phil. Langdale, bassoon soloist; a trained military
ballet corps, and an orchestra of nearly half-a-
hundred performers. Accommodation tables art?
disposed here and there, at which white-robed
attendants dispense ice-creams and “soft tack”
as desired, while promenades, and a sraoking-r.om
that is also end-on to the auditorium, are pro-
vided. The idea ought to take root and flourish
like a Moreton Bay fig-tree.

Williamson’s Juvenile Opera Co., at
Sydney Criterion, turned on “La Mascotte ” on
Boxing Night, to a holiday crush whom they suc-
ceeded in thoroughly pleasing. Lily Everett’s
Bettina, Marion Mitchell’s Pippo, Lily Stephens’
Fiametta, Master A. Stephens’ Laurent (a trifle
overdone), Master Quealey’s Rocoo, and Daisy
Holly’s Frascello deserve special mention. The
juveniles seem to enjoy their own performances as
much as do the audiences.

The Cogills still endanger the rafters ot
the Sydney Garrick With their mirbh-splitting
burlesquing. They inaugurated a Complete change
of programme on Boxing Night. “Our Sociali-
ties ” has spine rib-tickling items-—Horace Bent’s
“Lucinda Mopps ” and W. Cogill’s “I caught it;”
also, the Sisters Anderson’s pretty medley,
“Bouquet,” and the amusing “New Mystics. ’ A
screaming farce, “ The Brook,” concludes a fat-
tening entertainment.

Sacred concerts were the rule on Christmas
Night in Sydney. The public crowded the Cen-
tennial Hall to hear the chorus and orchestra of
the Philharmonic Society give Handel’s “Messiah,”
with Signor Hazon conducting, and Wiegand at
the organ. The grand choruses were received
with irrestrainable applause, and Madame
Antoinette Link, Cecily Staunton, P. J. Barrett
and Edward Earley may be specially congratu-
lated on their individual successes. At Her
Majesty’s, Charles Huenerbein supervised a sacred
and classical concert, contributed to by such exe-
cutants as Mrs. Riley, Misses Violette, Lottie
Hyam, Annis Montagu and Nellie Young, Messrs.
Chas. Turner, Hallewell, Rivers Allpress, Straus,
Rainford, and others. The concert has been well
spoken of. The Misses Albu’s concert at the
Garrick, though artistically a success, was not so
numerously patronised. The Misses Albu were
assisted by Winifred Stratton, a Maoriland
pianiste; Nelly Lyons, who recited G. R. Sims’
“Billy’s Rose;” and a few vocalists. At the
Alhambra, a classical and sacred concert was
contributed by Annetta Scasi, Alma Obrey, W.
Ryan, Fred. Spencer, E. Lawler and Harry
Barrington.

Tracey’s Vaudeville Minstrels at Sydney
School of Arts are doing good business to full
houses with a new holiday programme, a new
addition to the company being Blanche Montague.
“Eaust up to Date” has superseded “Cinderella,”
while “Is Marriage a Failure?” continues to
hum. The Polytechnic, a new venture in the
Imperial Arcade, Pitt-street, at popular prices,
has taken the public fancy well, and runs the
Faust Brothers, a fighting kangaroo, and a host of
side-shows and novelties. At the Royal Standard
Theatre, the Whiterod Bros. Company has taken
the boards with a variety programme. Gordon’s
Harbour Concerts on board the steamer Alathea
have been a successful holiday fancy.

What’s a pantomime ?
Folly of a season,

Reason out of rhyme.

Fernandez only ascended a* few score feet and
came down tamely on to the back of a cow. On

The people of Adelaide have had the
reputation of being a music-loving public, but the
scant patronage bestowed on Madame Simonseu’s
undoubtedly clover and artistic company of
Italian vocalists at once dispels the idea. All the
leading standard operas have been presented, but
with one single exception the houses have been
meagre in the extreme. .The artistes have won
for themselves an excellent reputation, and the
few who have had the pleasure of listening to
their superb vocalisation are charmed indeed, but
this in itself does not add to the managerial coffer.
Grand Opera is not likely to bo attempted in
Adelaide again for an indefinite period. Wirth’s
colossal Circus is a big draw. Extensive arrange-
ments on a fresh site have been made, and, aided
by the energetic Alexander, who has worked
matters up in hi* characteristic style, the show
is likely to boom for some time.

Pantomime at Melbourne Alexandra, in-
terpreted in most places by a company still suffer-
ing from the horrors of “East Lynne,” made a
slow, chaotic commencement on Xmas Eve. Pro-
bably the management would have done better to
run up a new and rorty yarn for the occasion,
instead of letting Garnet Walch employ the im-
plement usually described as his “veteran pen”
upon a puerile chestnut like “Jack the Giant
Killer.” The result was not happy on the open-
ing night, but as the book announces that sundry
items’are subject to alteration there are grounds
for hoping that a lot of others will also be repaired
by degrees. For a certain solemn stiffness in the
joints of the male performers, and a decidedly
gloomy tendency on the part of a limited orchestra,
the author is not blamable, however. Neither is
the despondent attitude of the Fairy Queen to be
urged against him, nor the general lack of brisk-
ness in stage-management a matter over which
his genius has much control. Yet the burden of
his responsibility is heavy enough. That “Jack
theG.K.” has become a somewhat coherent riot
ere now, and that the principals are getting a
little fun in edgeways, may be taken for granted.
Aggie Kelton, who has brought her fetching
style to bear upon the name-part, will require to
come forrarder if she wishes to make her warble
audible all over the house. Which remark applies
with less force to Rose Dampier, who, by the way,
ought to cut up her gveen frock into fancy dusters.
George Dean, Robert Vernon, and a few other
people are certain to spread themselves in their
respective characters anon, and if the remaining
dozen or so make heroic efforts to be light and
frisky,they may possibly succeed. It all rests
with themselves. Scenery by John Hennings and
Alta is liberally laid on, whilst the show is super-
numerioally the strongest ever presented on the
stage of the Aleck.

“ The Merry Monarch,” which is neither
a comic opera, nor a tragedy, nor a pantomime,
but a sort of consecutive leg-story without a pur-
pose, or a kind of musical narrative intersected by
another giddy ballet, went off in a blaze of
magnificence at the Princess’ on Boxing Night.
At a first glance the Monarch looks like a person
who has come to stay, and it will be time to
consider him more fully next week. Besides
there is already too much splendour and so forth
in the present issue.

“Dick Whittington” has taken the classic
boards of Melbourne Royal on a long lease. All
the important elements of success are perceptible
in this costly hotch-potch, albeit some of them
were not turned to enough account at the first
attempt. George Coppin, as boss director of the
hitherto unprosperous A.T.M. Co., annihilates in
one act the notion that he has lost touch of the
popular pulse, for the present pantomime is dis-
tinctly up to date. The child and the chappy
can sit down together, like the lamb and the ass
of Divine Writ, and chant the praises of this
Xmas folly in different keys. Even the inevit-
able lapses into “old-fashioned fun” have a
modem finish about them that tends to hide their
antiquity and justify the youngsters’ glee. In
higher art departments “Dick Whittington” is
all there. The men of the Barnes-Lucelle troupe
(imported) are merely nimble knockabouts, but
the girls dance with a poetry of motion not
sufficiently appreciated by a Boxing-Night audi-
ence, which is mostly overfed, and generally
inclined to look drunk. As for the dresses and
scenic fixings—which had to be magnificent to
compete with the displays at two rival houses
they fulfil the promises and vows made by their
godfathers. Brunton has out-Bruntoned himself
m one or two heavy sets, in a beautiful panorama
dealing with the voyage and wreck of the Betsy
Jane, and finally in a delightful transfonnatioii-
scene.

Billie Barlow, the leading lady from
“ ’ome,” is an elegant jewel who sparkles in the
limelight like a taller edition of Nellie Farren,
and sings with wonderfully good enunciation.
She is “jimp,” is Billie, also of a nice, suitable age
for falling in love with. At present she has a
weakness for verses glorifying the Dook of Clar-
etue and that decayed crank, General Gordon.
However, when she clutches the real drift of Aus-
tralian sentiment Billie will feel very sorry for
herself and sin no more in that direction.—
J.illiau Davies is a lissome damsel who speaks
volumes with Iter lower extremities, but Edith
Vane, the fair Alice of the legend, is not sufficient
of a prirna-donna to make much difference if site
forgot to sing a ballad every now and then.
George Walton, lively as ever, and Arthur
Lauraine. a newcomer encased in bladders, can
both of them be made more use of, and the ever-
green Gre.viUe has retained once more bringing
a perambulating bustle in bis train. The show
will bear a lot of palling together, but its success
was quite definitely settled on Saturday by Whit-
tington’s procession, a gorgeous spectacle that
caused the house to sit up and shout again.

Snazellc, at the Athemeum, has had no
occasion to darn the bad taste of people who
stop away, for it is all joy with him since the
new entertainment got under weigh, and he rocks
in the cradle of the deep (Snazzy’s awful deep)
with a bag of profits for his piliow. The three
halls in Bourke-street, also a lot of other matters,
are in lull swing and may get a line of praise if
they don’t take care.

Regarded as a banquet for the eye, a feast
of fascinating stage pictures, the Brough-Bouei-
cault production of “ Much Ado About Nothing ”
would be esteemed a great theatrical event in any
city of the world. The suiting of the scene to the
action is sometimes clumsy, as when an eaves-
dropper is required to flit “ unobserved ” across a
terrace in such a way that the speakers couldn’t
miss seeing him if they tried, or when Benedick
remains concealed in a bower which no wary
bachelor would regard as a hiding-place under
the existing circumstances. These, however, are
only slight strains upon one’s imagination and in
no way detract from the glory of a series of spec-
tacles that cannot be treated according to their
deserts in a brief notice. From f’rst to last the
entertainment at Melbourne Bijou testifies to the
care, taste, brains, and cash spent in the endea-
vour to compel admiration. Should the town
neglect to roll up and keep this thing of
beauty in evidence for many weeks to come
the blame will rest with the Waits ’tween
acts. Shakespearean comedies are not so absorb-
ingly interesting as cranks would have us believe
them to be—the plot and much of the dialogue of
“Much Ado ” seem decidedly soft to the irreverent
multitude. People can’t employ their minds dur-
ing the intervals in wondering what will happen
next, because the Bard never gives us a new play
nowadays, nor was he a great hand at springing
surprises on’em when ho did produce a noveltj’.
Yet it is to be hoped and expected that the com-
bination of Spong’s scenery with such a general
perfection of detail will be strong enough to carry
a heavy load of “curtain ” triumphantly through
a long season.
* # •
To say that the acting is fully worthy of
its scenic halo were too much jam ; yet theß. & B.
band keep excellent time and tune, so to speak.
Brough’s quietly-irnpressive performance of
Leonata is well supported by Corlesse, as his
brother Antonio, and the scene in which the two
old men round upon empty-headed Claudio, and
reckon up the Prince of Arragon as a royal petti-
fogger, is very realistic. Borachio (J. Cosgrove)
speaks his lines and bears himself admirably,
whilst two nicer lady - helps than Emma
C-wynne and Hilda Spong never assisted to round
off a cast. Other background figures are worthily
represented. Sass does his little bit as Don John
in a highly genteel manner, and Cecil Ward,
barring a tendency to hysteria, is a first rate
Claudio. Percy Lyndal, too, looks fit to be en-
shrined in a handsome Dutch-metal frame, but bis
delivery still smacks of the Sunday-school teacher,
and his merriment has the ring of a bad half-crown.
Moreover he doesn’t put on side when least ex-
pected, just to let them taste his quality. Miss
Emma Temple is another one who might be more
convincing in her part. She doesn't cling, to
Claudio sufficiently, and her distress of mind
when the tragic time arrives is rather thin agony.
Here, too, Mrs. Brough fell short of what is
usually expected from Beatrice, although in all
the light bantering passages she played up
with plenty of spirit. Unfortunately, Mrs.
Brough has something of Lyndal’s way
of speaking, and is often most artificial
when she would wish to appear most natural.
Titheradge, take him for all in all, is a good
Benedick, manly and amusing, nevertheless the
character might be played with broader effect,
like most of the others. Anson can’t help being a
funny Dogberry, and a Mr. Tom Cannam, who
makes his first Australian appearance as the aged
Verges, behaves after the ordinary fashion of a
pantaloon. There was plenty of applause for the
principals on Boxing Night, and thundering calls
for artist Spong, . . .
Heigho ! Billie Barlow,
There’s never a man so crusty
But he will say, in a humdrum way,
When, merrily O, you trill your lay,
That Billie is not so dusty.
Yni r voice is clear as the draught of beer
We mink to your eyes whilst foaming,
And your style is light as the rhyme we write,
Or the dews that fall with the shades of night,
As we softly sigh in the gloaming—
Heigho ! Billie Barlow.

One of the little Melbourne weeklies evidently holds a
well-marked brief for Melba. It speaks of “ Kangaroo
Charlie” as “ the thing she calls her husband.’ When
Charles aforesaid(now in Europe) calls round at the office
and asks for the editor, there’ll be nary an editor nearer
than Heidelberg.
An American writer on Bernhardt“ What is the
charm of that unique countenance, with its cold, close
mouth, its mysterious, baffling eye, its fine little nose,

the sphinx might be if it had been subjected to modern
influences. It is a face in which there is everything but
love.”
Alfred Dampter terribly put out if shown to he astray
in any stage “ business.” It was pointed out to him the
other day that he made the “ sign of the cross ” from the
wrong side, and he was savage. By the way, how many,
not of “ the true faith,” arc there who do know how they
should “cross themselves?”
The latest about Bandmann, now in the milk business
in America, is that he has brought a suit against Louise
Beaudet to recover £5OO with interest lent her at various
times since 1885. And yet Beaudet in French means
donkey!
There is, it appears, more than one Lothario involved
in that great theatrical divorce case. That other man is
a Belgian painter.
Polly Newbury, a promising “serio-comic” of the
London music halls, was shot dead by her husband the
other day, after which the misgu ded idiot blew his own
brains out. Polly had been giddy, but if all the husbands

same way the music-hall world would indeed be a gory
sphere.
When the Arkansas Giantess, with Sells’ Circus,
boarded the Monowai, at ’Frisco, en route for Sydney, she
went and saw the fij-foot berth which had been allotted
to her 8-ft. 2J-inches of length. Then she hastened up to
the captain and asked him where she was to sleep.
“ Sleep ?” answered Captain Mick Carey, “why the only
thing I can think of is the mainsail. I’ll order that to be
slung amidships as a hammock for you !”
Allen Morris, a new baritone of Williamson’s opera
company, who has been lying low since he arrived from
England four months ago, made his first Melbourne
appearance at a Metropolitan Liedertafel “smoke,” the
other evening. Morris turns out tp have a fine, well-
trained voice, far more flexible than Ryley’s, and as his
face and general appearance are of the poetic, melancholy
order it seems a pity that J.C.W. doesn’t trot the young
man forth and give the frisky matrons a fresh chance to
enthuse.
The Silbons, of Sells’ circus, have had a lively time since
they last left Australia two years ago. Going via Maori
land and Brazil they reached Buenos Ayres, and had just
stalled their show when the insuro <-fion came alonx and
started an opposition cue in the Silicons’ own theatre. Oh
the second night, while all was going merrily, two rifle-
shots, that smashed through the outer door of the theatre
and buried themselves .in the wall, interrupted the per-
formance. Next instant 300 armed citizens rushed into
the building. The Silbons and part of the audience
stopped where they were, the remainder 1 got.” All the
ladies took refuge underneath the stage. The insurgents
locked up the theatre and climbed tluough the trap-doors
upon the flat roof. While the root stratagem remained a
secret they played up high jinks. The Silbons were set
to clean rifles and load them and to do any odd jobs that
suggested themselves to an insurgent’s mind. Any indi-
vidual that showed himself in the streets around got
knocked into pie before he could breathe one prayer. A
tramcar of policemen, drawn by two mules, that came to
quell everything, were shot dead by one volley. But next
day the dodge became known, and every man who wanted
to fight got upon a house to do it. During the morning
many shots whizzed overhead or struck high up on the
theatre walls, and soon after noon the stage-carpenter
was mortally wounded in the abdomen, lie died on the
mattress used by the tumblers. No one else was injured
in the theatre, and on the third morning all firing ceased.
In a few days the Silbons re-opened, and played to good
houses for three weeks. In Santiago they struck another
rebellion. On the eleventh night the Government ordered
them to close the theatre, and only through the inter-
cession of the English and American Consuls were they
allowed to leave the troubled city behind them. They
took passage to Valparaiso, and found that street fighting
was the order of the midnight and the wee sma’ hours
there. Nevertheless, they showed every evening, being
escorted to and fiom the theatre by a squad of British
jack-tars from the British ironclad Warspite, lying in the
harbour.
Says a correspondent who ought to know: —I advise
any companies coming north during next year to avoid
Bundaberg, Maryborough, and Gympie. They are all in
a state bordering upon bankruptcy so far as show biz. is
concerned. In Bundaberg for the past four months no
show has paid exes. The theatre is £5 nightly, and the
billing most extortionate, while the houses range from £7
to £lO per night. W. 11. Jude was brought up from
Brisbane by speculators, and did not take much more
than the rent in two nights. In Maryborough they said
he was no good and couldn’t play. The “Maryhur-
rowers” were so shocked at the “vulgarity” ofDr.
Bill ” that they stayed away in large numbers on the
second night. The Hellers and Percy Abbott also played
this route lately, and declare them to he the three worst
show-towns in Queensland.
“The Bulletin says it is strange that a city of bO.OI'O
inhabitants, like Newcastle, should not be able to support
a regular theatre. The reason is, they love their beer too
well for brains to have a show. A prize-fight, a cock-fight,
or even a dog-fight, and a foot-race is what takes Geordie’s
fancy, hut don’t give him anything where he has to sit
still, or where it is a long time between drinks” —writes a
malevolent showman.
Maddison Morton, dramatist, died a few days back (in a
London theatrical poorhouse, we believe) an unlucky
n,an. Fifty years ago, and more, his farces were all the
rage, particularly at the Adel phi, where he kept up
pabulum for Wright, Bedford, and Co. Nothingdestroyed
him, hut an entire revulsion of public gusto, which would
not endure the farce.
Apropos Coppin’s offer of £lOO and £5O as prizes for an
Australian drama u la Sims and Peltitt, this kind of
thing has never succeeded in dramatic history, and there
was Web iter’s celebrated venture that way, eventuating
in Mrs. Gore’s “ Day of Dupes.”

Pietro Mascagni will get not a penny for the American

Haddon Chambers’ new play, “The Honourable Hu-
bert,” has been well-received in London, and is evidently
a good thing.
Snazelle’s latest, “The Cocoa-nut Man’s Story,” is a
first-rate cockney yarn of the O. R. Sims style’ and he
tells it very well.
The 16th inst. will be the 90th anniversary of the
foundation of the Australian Theatre. The building was
put up at a cost of £lOO. The play was “ The Re\ engc,”
with an afterpiece “The Hotel.” This was the occasion
on which the prologue alleged to he written by pick-
pocket Barrington was recited.
The latest wonder-working draw in London is Mrs.
Annie Abbott, “ the Georgia Magnet,” a frail 9st. woman
who performs some wonderful feats of resistance and
strength by means of some esoteric power that is puzzling
all the scientists and is filling the Alhambra nightly, and
pouring into the Magnet’s lap the reasonable salary of
£l5O weekly. Mrs. Abbott lifts six men in a chair with-
out apparent exertion, and defies six men to move her off
one heel, though pulling three on each side, at a billiard-
cue held across her breast. Her only stipulation is that
the hands of the operator must touch her actual flesh.
When she covers her elbows with her sleeves she can he
lifted easily ; but when she bares her elbows, four men,
two on each side, cannot lift her, strain how they may.
Charley Mitchell, tHe champion pugilist, was called upon
by the audience one night to go on the stage and try his
chances. With Iter sleeves down he lifted Annie with the
greatest ease ; indeed, it seemed as if he had some idea of
throwing her through the roof. With her elbows bared,
Charley tugged, pulled, bent his knees almost to the
floor, writhed and heaved till the veins seemed about

“The Man of Crenius”: A Review.*
“ Cheat wit to madness sure is near allied,” or
something like it, says an English poet. Shake-
speare some while since noted correspondences
between the lunatic, the lover, and the poet.
Gerard de Nerval, in his “Le Reive et la Vie,”
confesses that he wrote often in a state of morbid
exaltation, and then adds that the old adage,
Mens sana in corpore sano, is a lie, for many
powerful minds have been allied to weak and
diseased bodies. Genius, maintained the ancient
Greeks, was a sublime madness. The poet’s eye
rolls with fine frenzy throughout the whole history
of letters. A French savant recently claimed for
Denmark a leading place among nations, for in
that country the percentage per population of
criminals, drunkards, lunatics, and men of
remarkable ability was higher than in any other—
and this roughly appears to be the conclusion of
modern science.
* * #
.Some few months back appeared in the “Con-
temporary Science Series ” (edited by Havelock
Ellis, and published by Walter Scott), a remark-
able book on criminal anthropology and psychology
entitled “ The Criminal. ” The name of Havelock
Ellis appeared on the title-page as author, but, as
he himself admitted, he was merely the compiler,
and his book was a summary of the great work of
Dr. Cesare Lombroso, “L’Uomo Delinquente,”
1889. The latest volume of the same series is a
direct translation from Dr. Lombroso’s pen, in
which he deals with the anthropology and
psychology of the “great man,” treating him
purely as a natural product, like the criminal or
the lunatic, to whom indeed the genius bears a
wonderful resemblance. Lombroso’s leading idea
is that genius is a special morbid condition, evi-
dencing various characters of degeneration and
atavism, which lie at the root of nearly all forms
of congenital mental abnormality, and which,
with a slightly varying environment, fill the
padded room or the condemned cell, the emperor’s
throne, or the poet’s chair.
“ Very terrible,” writes the author, “is the
religion of truth ; ” and very terrible to a sensi-
tive mind must be a perusal of this book, with its
awful iconoclastic theory, supported by hundreds
of facts and minute observations, and deduced in
an undeviatingly logical spirit by one of the
keenest of analytical and scientific minds. Lom-
broso demands a patient hearing : the physiologist
is not afraid to reduce love to a play of stamens
and pistils, and thought to a molecular movement,
why then should we hesitate to examine proofs
which may class genius as on the confines of
criminality, as one of the teratologic forms of the
human mind, as a variety of insanity? He sup-
- ports his position from the writings and utter-
ances of the greatest minds, who are thus brought
into court to incriminate themselves. He quotes
Uiderot
Oh ! how near are genius and madness ! Tiiose whom
heaven has branded for evil or for good are more or less
subject to these symptoms: they reveal them more or
less frequently, more or less violently. Men imprison
them and chain them, or raise statues to them.
He N'erval, Baudelaire, Poe, He Goncourt, Rous-
seau, Gogol, are each laid under contribution to
furnish proofs of their own lunacy.
# # #
Pascal maintained that extreme intelligence was
very near to extreme madness, and he was a
striking example of his own theory. But Lom-
broso points out that many other marks of de-
generation than lunacy may accompany rare
ability, such as smallness of stature, rickets,
pallor, emaciation, cretin-like physiognomy, lesions
of head and brain, stammering, left-handedness,
sterility, variation from parental type (atavism),
precocity, delayed development, misoneism (con-
servatism in everything not connected with one's
own special pursuits), vagabondage, unconscious-
ness and instinctiveness, somnambulism, inspira-
tional frenzy, dualism of personality, intermittent
productiveness, periodic stupidity, perverted sen-
sibility, terrors of sensuous perception, exhaustion,
amnesia (sporadic forgetfulness), eccentricity,
epilepsy, melancholy, delusions of grandeur,
seizure of self-doubt, tendency to alcoholism,
moral insanity, solitarism and longevity. The
list of delinquencies is a long one, and the gods
appear to have abused the poor genius to the
full extent of their tether.
* # *
Amongst little bodies the author mentions
some of the owners of the greatest minds :
Aristotle, Plato, Alexander, Epicurus, Hiogenes,
Spinoza, Beethoven, Heine, He Quincey, Balzac,
the Brownings, George Eliot, Thiers, and Swin-
burne. Agesilaus, iEsop, Scarron, Pope, Leo-
pardi, Talleyrand, Scott, Owen, Gibbon, Byron
and many others were all either rachitic,
lame, hunch-backed or club-footed. Pallor
has been called the colour of great men. It is also
one of the most frequent signs of degeneration in
the morally insane. Hozens of geniuses were weak
and sickly in their childhood. Hozens of others
were extremely emaciated in the flower of their
age. “Voltaire’s slight, bent body was only a
thin transparent veil, through which one seemed
to see his soul and genius. Lamennais was a
small, almost imperceptible man, or rather a
flame chased from one point of the room to the
other by the breath of his own restlessness.”
Socrates, Rembrandt, Hostoieffsky, Magliabecehi,
Pope, Carlyle and Harwin had faces like cretins
or monkeys. Lesions of the head and brain are
very frequent among men of genius. Lombroso
writes :
The celebrated Australian novelist, Marcus Clarke,
when a child, received a blow from a horse’s hoof which
crushed his skull.
Malformations of the cranium were characteristics
also of Nico, Malebranche, Bichat, Kant, Mac-
hiavelli and many others.
* * *
Many men of genius are noted for stammering
and left-handedness, but the great characteristic of
all, perhaps, is sterility. La Bruyere said ■
These men have neither ancestors nor descendants ;
they themselves form their entire posterity.
The list of celibate great ones is a long one, and
those who married seem not to have had enough
virility to transmit their names beyond the third
generation. Most men of genius resemble not
their parents, but remote ancestors—like the
criminal, they are cases of pure atavism. They
are often precocious, writing finished works of
art at 15, like Victor Hugo, and this precocity is
morbid and atavistic. The proverb says—“ A
man who has genius at five is mad at fifteen.”
ihe children of the insane are likewise frequently
precocious. In other cases development is delayed,
and marked ability comes only with complete
maturity. The man of genius is frequently exces-
sively vain. Poushkin bit the shoulder of the
Governor-General's wife in a crowded the tre
because she did not attend while he was speaking,
threat minds are afflicted in many instances with
chorea, epilepsy, and melancholy, and even when
these mental afflictions are absent they are apt
. n k like men, feel like women, and act
like children. ” They are usually terrible drunkards,
these bright and shining ones ! Caesar was often
carried home on the shoulders of his soldiers.
Alexander died drunk. The list of magnificent
drunkards is almost interminable.
* # *
The wives of great men have suffered almost as
much as the husbands of great women. Lytton,
from the first days of his marriage, amused him-
self with biting and insulting his wife. Carlyle
tortured his devoted mate to the grave. Doni-
zetti, after beating his wife nearly to death, burst
“AN ILL WIND,” &c.
THIN PARTY: “Had a stroke of luck, mate?”
STOUT PARTY: “ Well, I have had some good jobs at financial institutions fixing up iron
shutters when the crisis arrived.”
into tears and composed the beautiful air, Tu che
a Dio. Dumas tore out his wife’s hair, and then,
after shedding many tears, wrote a scene for a
comic drama, remarking “ If tears were pearls, I
would make myself a necklace of them.” The
husbands of women of genius have fared no better.
Lombroso, however, insists that a woman of genius
is a contradiction in terms —a woman of genius is
a man. Among criminals the woman is more
masculine, the man more feminine than her or
his own sex-type. Schools, says Lombroso, are
the enemies of genius. They may assist a few to
development, but they destroy many more. Let
the schoolmaster stick to his business and culti-
vate mediocrities. Criminals and lunatics are
usually religious. Very few Atheists ever find
their way into lunatic asylums or prisons.
Genius, if not religious, is exceedingly super-
stitious and subject to hallucinations.
# # *
After tracing insanity in genius, Lombroso
examines the statistics of lunatic asylums, and
proves that mental aberration frequently favours
special developments to an extent almost equiva-
lent to the manifestations of genius. He then
studies the mattoid, the eccentric man who forms
a link between genius and insanity. The mattoid
is generally a sane man of some ability, witli a
craze for false ideals—say, “Dead-houses,” “Btatc-
houses,” “changing a continent’s name at his own
fiat," &o. The book throughout bristles with
appalling facts of the most sensationally scientific
character, and, what is more, within the power of
verification by almost everyone who has read any-
thing on the subject. Let any Australian, taking
the men whom we are proud to consider men of
genius, honestly consider the biographies of such
men as Clarke, Kendall, Deniehy, Gordon, and
others whom it is needless to specify, and then
answer to the best of his ability the theory
advanced by Dr. Lombroso.

Dr. Gamin, M.L.C., is to move in N. S.
Wales Legislative Council, on 13th inst., a resolu-
tion which shall permit Bills initiated in one
session, to be in the following session taken up
at their dropped stage of progress and proceeded
with. This is good, so far as it goes, but there
is a danger that its adoption, as it stands, may
involve a converse reaction. At present, a Bill
that is introduced and defeated at any of its
many stages cannot be re-introduced during the
same session. Now, if a resolution be passed
making the Bills of one session common also to
the following session, let it be clearly stated—so
as to prevent any future legal hairsplitting as to
the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee
—that the new standing order shall not prevent
Bills defeated in one session from being re-intro-
duced during the following session ; and let it be
also clearly conserved, in actual untwistable
language—for the same reason as aforesaid—that
Bills passed in one session may be repealed in a
following session. In short, let no ambiguity of
language give a clever pettifogger a chance to
prove that a whole Parliament, so far as its
business and legislative powers are concerned, is
only one session, interrupted by merely formal
adjournments.

POLITICAL POINTS
Obituary.—The Australasian Freetrade
Association.
A. G. Taylor may sit again for Mudgee in
next N.S.W. Assembly,
The South Australian L.Y, Act, just
passed, closes all hotels on Sunday.
After all, G. H. Reid has only three
enemies—his eye-glass, Parkes, and the Single-tax
Party.
The most Conservative member of the
N.S.W. Upper House is Pilcher, Q.C., who,
after all, sprang from the people.
G. R. Dibbs is at the head of his strongest
administration. Toby Barton is displaying the
tone, the tact, and the talent of a party leader.
Let Dibbs take Reid & Co. at their word.
Let him bring in an equitable land-tax and these
attitudinisers will either have to support it or
die.
The members of the House of Lords alone
own 14,258,527 acres of land in the British Isles.
This is more than one-sixth of the whole area,
which is 77,929,960 acres.
According to Sydney Daily Telegraph,
Premier Dibbs has really said, “D-A-M-N the
Telegraph !” Henceforth, then, not the Daily,
but the Damned Telegraph.
Parkes, before he left office, gave a gratuity
of <£7oo to Lieut.-Col. Murphy, and one of .£lOOO
to Lieut. H. Le Patourel upon their retirement
from the Permanent Artillery !
Of the 72 members of the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Assembly of 1877 but five remain : Parkes,
H. H. Brown, Dibbs, F. B. Suttor, and Hughey
Taylor. Is this the survival of the fittest ?
Sir John Bray’s friends state he intends to
stand for the Commons after his three years’ term
as S.A. Agent-General. He expects to be piloted
by Lord Rosebery in the Liberal interest.
Kingston will probably bo S.A. Premier
by next Christmas or thereabouts. With Bray
out the Playford party won’t last much longer,
and no Ministry will last long when Kingston
goes into opposition.
Says the N.Q. Herald concerning the
Clarence-Teck betrothal:—
The future King of England has selected the future
Queen.
It’s hazardous to prophesy.
Of the members of N.S.W, Legislative
Assembly of 1862 not one is now in that Chamber.
In the last Parliament there were three, Burns,
Garrett and Sutherland, of whom the two latter
are now dead and the former out of Parliament.
In January, 1889, G. H. Reid declared
that he would not seek or accept any N.S. Wales
Ministerial office until his nractice at the bar had
made him independent. Is G.H.R. now indepen.
dent, or has he forgotten his self-imposed compact?
From St. James’ Gazette “New South
Wales colonists have just passed through a
General Election under universal suffrage—that
modern substitute for the Black Death of
mediaeval times.” This is the wail of drowning
Torydom.
“I have been a victim of misrepresenta-
tion and lies,” growls Premier Dibbs, “on the
part of Sydney D.T. for the last five years.” And
yet Editor Nall and Sub-Editor AVestlake are
1 ■ ding members of the Christian Young Men’s
Association !
According to Hanson’s “ Pastoral Posses-
sions of N.S. Wales,” 44,739,111 acres of the
mother colony are in the hands of 12 banks and
financial syndicates. The Australian Mortgage
Land and Financial Co. alone holds an area of
8,500,000 acres !
The contest for East Adelaide, Bray’s
seat, at the end of January will be between the
so-called “National Defence League” and
the Trades and Labor Council with, if possible, no
other candidates. At present the Democratic
party is quite confident.
™ C ‘ Baker > in the second reading of
the S.A. Electoral Law Amendment Bill, “could
not see why those who had by their energies ac-
cumulated money should not be allowed to use
their means in electioneering in promulgatino-
their views.” Not to-day, Baker.

The Dibbs ministry has the promise of a
dissoluhon-Hf the Tariff Bill is defeated on the
second reading. The Freetrade partisans quail
at the prospect of an appeal to the province, and
apparently are quite content with offering a
passive resistance to the enactment of the national
policy.
When Premier Ballance, of Maoriland,
was threatened by the argument that his graduated
tax would cause capital to be withdrawn from the
province, he merely exclaimed : “ Let it go, if it
wishes, in the name of Heaven ; we shall get
good value for it.” Just so; it can only clear out
by selling out.
The Tasmanian Parliament has just con-
cluded probably the most profitable session it has
over known. Nothing but syndicate business has
been transacted. It was no uncommon thing to
hear honorable members denouncing some syndi-
cate Bill right and left one night and supporting
it through thick and thin next day !
Ex-Speaker Barton characterises Parkes’
violent behaviour towards Sir Patrick Jennings in
1886 as “ the most disgraceful page” in the history
of the N.S.W. Parliament; while G. H. Reid
rejoices that he did not join in “ that organised,
and sometimes most disgraceful struggle,” in
which Parkes figured so discreditably.
“ The power of the public-house in politics
originates in unions of the trade for purposes of
self-defence. The drink-shop will disappear from
politics when meddlesome, but well-meaning
persons, cease agitating for laws invading the
private rights of those that sell and those that use
alcoholic stimulants,” says Pentecost.
The election of Major M‘Kinley to the
Governorship of the important farming State of
Ohio is about the best proof procurable of the
efficacy of his policy. Farmers are usually be-
hind the times and are the stubbornest opponents
of change. Hence great indeed must be the
weight of the Republican arguments.
The Freetrade party in N.S.W. Parlia-
ment is rather nervous. Even Parkes silently
acquiesced in the passing of the resolutions on
which the Dibbs Tariff Bill is founded. Five
years ago the old Parliamentary hand billingsgated
Jennings across the table. Then he was bidding
for power, now he is intriguing for a pension.
“ One of the lessons I have learned is that
the working people, as a class, are in the unfor-
tunate position they are in because, as a class,
they are incapable of being any better off. They
are wedded to the clergymen and the politicians.
“WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH OUR BOYS?”
There has been at least one avenue open to the aspiring youth of the Australian Foreign-trade province.
“WANTED, a smart Boy, to lead a blind man about. Mr.--175 --st., Redferu.”
They will follow a black gown and a brass band
into slavery, and they enjoy their servitude.”
The Commonwealth Bill of the late Fede-
ration Convention has got badly addled. In
N.S.W. and Bananaland it has never seen the
parliamentary night-lights; in Victoria and»South
Australia, it has been half-chewed and then
dropped like tooth-defying gristle. When Reid
is N.S.W. Premier, it will be passed into law,
flying.
Some sympathetic variety of country
editor puts in a good word for Parkes, on the
ground that the old man's critics have been
“hitting him below the belt.” The Bulletin
here rises to point out that Parkes has worn his
belt right on the top of his head for the last thirty
years, and you must hit him below it or else not
hit him at all.
The crown of England was manufactured
in 1838, and is valued at .£300,000, which, at 4
per cent, per annum, represents .£12,000 a year,
or .£2OOO more than the President of the United
States gets as his salary ! At compound interest
this trash represents, since it was made, the
enormous sum of .£3,400,000, or, perhaps, enough
to stay poverty in London !
In France the clergy, as per late cables,
renew the fierce struggle for educational control.
Robespierre’s party submitted a splendid educa-
tional programme, but it was never carried out, and
Bonaparte called in the clergy again, their influence
being deepened by the Bourbons. The present
Republic, in 1880, reverted to the Robespierre
programme, which has steadily been forced on
since.
“ A friend of mine,” writes John M‘Elhone
in a Sydney Freetrade paper, “ well versed in the
dark and tricky ways of political chicanery told
mo some weeks ago that Sir Henry Parkes wanted
£lO,OOO and £lOOO a year for life' - ’ as a solatium
for “closing the door of his political life for ever.”
The N.S.W. Parliament that is willing to pension
Parkes has yet to be elected. Dare one member
of “ that set of persons called the Labour-party ”
vote a pension to Parkes ?
The Comte de Paris renounces the French
throne, and the glorious revolution scores its last
triumph. The backbone of opposition was broken
with the death of the Prince Imperial, and the
last straw was Boulanger, unless you count the
foolish doings of young Orleans. Grevy put the
matter right when he said that after Mirabeau’s
failure the Monarchy was impossible in France,
Its foundations were dynamited for ever by
Robespierre, Danton, and Marat.
u Will Honeycomb ” licenses the political
whisper that, with the new year, Sir John Hay,
President of N.S. W. Legislative Council, will
resign his position, and that Sir Henry Parkes
will succeed him. The Bulletin dismisses the
rumor with a shrug of its shoulders. Although
“ a man must live,” Parkes’ ambition, even now,
is too mighty for such a billet. Endow the old
man with wings and he would at once offer to fly
Satan for the sovereignty of Sheol.
Melbourne Argus is aghast at the bare
idea that theMaoriland Government may “attempt
to degrade the (Legislative) Council by nominat-
ing a number of dummies, or mere time-serving
creatures of the Ministry.” Just awake, hey?
That’s exactly what has been going on all along
in Maoriland, but the Argus was conveniently
blind so long as the time-serving dummy nominees
were of the right and respectful Tory breed. It
makes a lot of difference whose dog gets kicked.
A British view of the American Tariff :
“ The promoters of the M’Kinley Tariff meant it
to push forward the policy of America for the
Americans. One method of realising it was to
keep all work within their own dominions. The
country was to be made self-supplying ; what
could be produced at home was not to be bought
abroad. That was the key-note of the M’Kinley
scheme, and it is working out the idea of its
designers with the precision and effecti%'eness of a
machine.”— Sheffield Daily Telegraph.
New York Standard, of 21sfc Oct. says
that “ Sir Henry Parkes, the Freetrade leader of
N.S.W., being a Single-taxman, is a radical Free-
trader.” Yes, Parkes is a radical Freetrader. He
has also for years acted as a radical Protectionist
wherever and whenever it suited him—especially
in such constituencies as Balmain and the South
Coast. He is likewise an enthusiastic Australian
Nationalist; he is also chief champion of Im-
perialism in Australia. Sir Henry Parkes is an
awful lot of things.
Thus Hon. G. W. Cotton (S.A.) in speak-
ing before the Council in favour of Kingston’s Con-
ciliation Bill: —“ The Bill might be considered a
well-meant effort to bring together two parties,
one of whom would not confer without concessions
being made beforehand. How little the employer
party liked the truth being known was shown not
long ago in Queensland, when a commission was
moved for by a labour representative to ascertain
the cause of recent disturbances. In this case 41
votes to 3 were afraid of the issue !”
Premier Dibbs to a Sydney D.T. reporter:
—“From this time forth I’m darned if I’ll recog-
nise the Daily Telegraph in any official capacity.
And if the treatment I’ve been receiving goes on
much further, I’ll issue instructions that the paper
is not to be recognised in any other department
either. You’ll do me a personal favour if you
don’t report me, either in the House or outside.
I don’t want to see my name in the paper again.
I won’t receive a reporter of the paper again, nor
a deputation with a Telegraph reporter attached
to it.”
Federation Convention cost N. S. W. £5806.
How was the money spent—how much on ban-
quets, picnics, lunches, cablegrams, editions de
luxe, and gratuities to parliamentary officials?
As a gratuity for six weeks services in connection
with the Convention, Speaker Abbott recom-
mended Parkes to pay the magnificent sum of <£3
to each messenger. Parkes, to his credit be it
said, declined to “ H.P.” the paltry recommenda-
tion of the niggardly Speaker; and every one,
clerks, messengers, and reporters, ultimately got
a month’s screw.
Premier Dibbs lias been so ill-advised as
to include an item of £196 in his estimates to
meet the abatement deductable from the impro-
perly granted pension of W. M. M. Arnold. First,
Mr. Arnold was not entitled to a pension because
he is in the prime of life (41!) and was not deprived
of his office ; secondly, if he ever was afflicted with
an incurable disease, he is now well enough to re-
sume his charge of the parliamentary records;
and thirdly if he is wealthy enough to be qualified
as a promoter of the “National” Association he
is deserving of no favours from the people’s repre-
sentatives.
It is said that Chief-Justice Lilley’s (of
Bananaland) conversion to radical-democracy was
as sudden as the religious conversion of Saul of
Tarsus. Years ago, when he was member for
Fortitude Valley, a working-man’s suburban
constituency, Brisbane, a public meeting gave
Charles “ partickler ” when he attempted to
excuse his Bill to establish an Imperial Militia,
and he had to scud off hurriedly, his rearguard
consisting of a valorous contingent, headed by
“the Wild Scotchman”—Macpherson. The ex-
dragoon took the lesson to heart and recanted
from Imperialism.
People are now all saying that they never
suspected Edmund Barton of such vim and
energy. Toby has, since joining the Dibbs
Ministry, come right out of his shell. He was, it
is true, constructed for a billet in which he could
sit down, but he has now chosen to stand up for
once in a way. Fat is reserve force. Look back
on the long list of men whom you have admired in
politics, law, and journalism, and sign paeans to
the Fat Man. In the Cabinet, Barton, whatever
his nominal position, will still be the man in the
chair, keeping his colleagues’ noses to the grind-
stone and giving the soft answer that turneth
away wrath.
Mr. Jack Murray, M.L.A., was responsible
for some words of wisdom, at Hawthorn (Melb.),
the other night. Fairly wound-up on the One-
man-one-vote question, J.M. waxed eloquent.
“ Whilst property was to be gained by self-denial,
that self-denial often went hand-in-hand with
meanness, and all the ignoble passions. So far as
he could see, the desire for the accumulation of
wealth destroyed everything that was noble and
admirable in the human character. The man who
saw that the exercise of thrift was going to give
him superior advantages to his neighbour would
not only deny himself a good deal, but would also
deny his neighbour,”
The entire tonnage carried in 1889 by all
the merchant ships of Great Britain was 524,
million tons —a vast amount being only water,
sand, and road-metal for ballast—and these figures
have been quoted till they make us feel tired as an
evidence of the advantages of the great Foreign-
trade system. During the same year one single
American railway company carried 664 million
tons, and nothing was said about it. The Free-
trader calls it commerce when goods are shifted
about 20 miles, from Dover to Calais, but when
they are moved about 4000 miles, from New York
to San Francisco, he doesn’t call that commerce.
And why this is, the ghost of the dead Cobdcn
only knows.
The Eight-hours’
movement in England,
if successful, can effect
nothing as a remedy for
social evils by itself.
England is a free-trade
country, and as long as
the cheap products of the
16-hour labourer from
the Continental centres
can be dumped down
on British wharves, the
shortening of the Britons’
hours of labour means
merely that wages must
come down in the same
ratio, or that he must
go without employment
altogether. The only
chance of salvation for
him lies in a protective
tariff, or in his inducing
the foreign workers to
join him in insisting on
an 8-hours’ labour maxi-
mum. But when it is
stated that the Shipping
Federation alone holds
203,000 blacklegs in readi-
ness for the next revolt,
it becomes easy to declare
which is the better
alternative.
The Sydney Free-
trade papers are very'
sore on the subject of re-
printing Toby Barton’s
withering exposureof the
financial maladministra-
tion of the Parkes Minis-
try. The cause of the
reprinting of this much-
dreaded utterance was the

by means of their “Perfection” Cooler and

water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or

works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.

When a young, hot-water-loving, Southern

which characterises him always, the newly-budded
Benedict replied “that he would not have a baby
till his book was published.” The book was pub-
lished last month. And the baby

Primate Smith states that he pays cabmen
the legal fare. When the clergy pay their watch-
word is legality. When, as in the Bishop’s recent
pastoral letter, they solicit donations their watch-
word is liberality Of such is the Kingdom of

Primate Smith thinks that a shilling is a

Bishop Smith, of Sydney, has one genuine
sympathiser in respect of his shilling-a-time
combat with the cabbies. This is a recently-
imported Englishman, no end of a heavy swell,
a buff-leather-booted, strapped-under-the-instep,
ear - embrasured - collar, every - latest - atrocity
Johnnie-come-lately. This tailor’s phenomenon
took a cab to catch the Manly steamer, which was
just about moving off as he alighted at Circular
Quay. The phenomenon pulled out a sov., but
cabby had no change. Johnnie, therefore, rushed
into the steamer-ticket-office and bought his
ticket, receiving 19s. change—nine florins and one
shilling. Placing the shilling between his finger
and thumb, in readiness to pay the cabman, he
held the nine florins in the palm of his hand. In
his hurry, he pressed these into cabby’s .fist,
dropped the shilling into his tram-ticket pocket,
and rushed excitedly for the steamer, while cabby
joyously touched his hat, and warbled, “ Merry
Krissmas, sir !” Just as he reached the steamer-
gangway, Johnny discovered hiserroy, and rushed
back to the street, but the cabby—oh, where was

thus irretrievably lost seventeen shillings, Johnny
rushed back towards the boat, only to find it
steaming away in the distance. Having now lost
his money and the boat as well, he concluded to
also lose his temper, and the wharf-loungers were
gratified to learn that a new-chum English noble-
man has been educated to swear up to any given
emergency.

When PadereAvski, the long-haired Polish
pianist, last appeared in London, a lot of the
most fashionable women, “including a Royal
Princess,” crowded round him and kissed his
hands, hife coat, and “even his coat-tails.” Let
us hope that when Paderewski, who is due here
shortly, arrives in Australia, the local fashion-
ables will not go very much further than this.

The callous subordination of the interests
of suitors to the convenience of the legal ring was
strikingly displayed in an action in the N.S.W.
Supreme Court on the last day of the sittings’
when at 4 o’clock Judge Innes adjourned the case
until February next!
We have received from the Benevolent
Society of N.S.W. a large blue pamphlet in which
that estimable institution appeals for assistance on
behalf of the poor. The publication is neatly
printed on thick paper with a red line, round the
margin of each page, and it is adorned with a re-
produced photo, entitled “View of Street
and the home of a widow and eight children,”
and another photo, described as “View of
Place and the family of a dying man.” Both
these families, it seems, arein receipt of assistance,
and therefore, we presume, couldn’t well rise up
and assault the emissary from a state-subsidised
institution, who turned their misfortunes and
SETTLING DOWN.
(And he did.)
Barkeeper (insinuatingly—to station-hand who has just icon a nice pot in Tatter sail’s sweep ) :
“Well, Tom, I suppose you’ll be leaving the district now you’ve won your pile ! ”
Tom ( confidently) : “Oh, no —I think I’ll take up a bit of ground and settle down.”
their dying father into an advertisement. It is
one of the lowest specimens of hog-meanness we
know of for any society to publish the portraits of
any widow and eight children, and announce them
as paupers through the length and breadth of
N.S. Wales, all on the strength of ss. a week, 6
loaves of bread, and Gibs, of beef. Judging by
four pages of elaborate letterpress attached to the
illustrations, somebody connected with the
Society took the writer of the pamphlet round to
these two houses, and they walked in with an air
of proprietorship, and overhauled things, after the
manner of the British female squire when she
storms the labourer’s cottage and lectures the in-
habitants on the iniquitous extravagance of having
bacon-fat for dinner. Probably the widow and
the “ wife and family of the dying man ” would
have liked to bounce them out, but, wo presume,
in that case they would have lost the ss. and the
beef.

The Bulletin sees it stated that the Dar-
linghurst gaol-flogger, who, by the way, was sent
up country the other day to skin a boy alive at
the instance not of a Judge and jury sitting in
open court, butof a couple of mere “beaks” sitting
in secret, has boon appointed, his hands still red
wuh blood, to the governorship of a N.S.W. up-
country gaol. As well appoint the Government
undertaker as official accoucheur —as well appoint
the high priest of Venus Cloacena, attired in his
working suit, mayor of the city ! Think of the
flogger—the creature only brought in when all
other things have confessedly failed —being
appointed as the first means of reformation ! No
more brutal insult was ever offered to civilisation
than this appointment.

The magistrates at Sydney Central have
forbidden the preliminary inspection of the charge-
sheet by the attorneys who haunt the court. The
gentlemen by Act of Parliament used to rush the
documents ten minutes before proceedings com-
menced, and then tout for custom amongst those
occupants of the dock who were specified as having
assets, or what Mr. Weminick calls “portables.”
The Bench thought this practice undignified. A
look of stony despair corrugates the features of
Dodson and Fogg, when they realise that a
“ josser ” or a “language man ” was arrested with
something more in his possession than the con-
ventional matchbox, knife, pipe and pawn-ticket,
and their hearts are bowed down with those
saddest of all sad words, “might have been.”

Sir Robert and Lady Hamilton and suite
(!) are staying at Launceston—nominally to patro-
nise the Exhibition, but possibly to retrench after
the terrible sardine-sandwich expenditure during
the visit of the Auxiliary fleet. Hobart is, very
quiet just at present, and likely to remain so for
some little time, “ society ” having been com-
pletely paralysed by typhoid and theV.D.L. Bank
smash. Many of the uppercrust are in mourning,
either for their relatives or their money. The
monetary cyclone is by no means over, and when
the tail of the gale comes, there will be some more
big crashes. The Barclays (the Tasmanian Roths-
children) are masters of the whole position—in
fact, may be said to have bought the whole island,
cheap.

Governor Hamilton goes “ home ” next

which on moonlight nights looks like the garden-

The Melbou me Hospital Committee were
asked, by the executors of the dead doctor, to let
the interest on Beancy’s bequest (£!100)go towards
the maintenance of his destitute brother and sister
in England, just in the meantime. It was, how-
ever, pointed out by the hospital secretary that
the application was ultra vires. Beaney’s “gene-
rosity ”is now seen in its true colours. Vain-
glorious" Champagne Charlie” succeeded only in
.advertising himself after death as the mean, con-
temptible brother, of two broken-down paupers.
A monument to his memory in Canterbury
Cathedral would not be so very inappropriate

In one of the “ kawlinies ” is a bishop’s

A Sydney daily reproves the French for

Here’s to the banks that are busted ;
Here’s to the “ trippers,” religiously “ rash,”
And here’s to the victims who trusted !
Let the toast pass, alack 1 and alas !
There’s little relief to be found in the glass.
Here’s to the books that were nothing but lies ;
Here’s to the auditors blinking ;
Here’s to the widows with tears in their eyes,
And here’s to the honest hearts sinking !
Out up the goose ; what is the use
Of sighing for property gone to the deuce?
Here’s to the pompous old fools on the Board ;
Here’s to the duty they shirk, sirs ;
Here’s to the fees which they haven’t restored
For passing embezzlers’ work, Sirs !
Serve the plum-duff ; there’ll be pudding enough
In the homes of the fellows who collared the stuff.
Here’s to the hope of a good time in store
(A chance it were folly to plunge on),
And hooroo ! for the rogues who will rob nevermore
So long as they stay in the dungeon.
Let the toast pass, alack ! and alas 1
’Tis a sorrowful face that we see in the glass.
IN MEMORIAM.
I know that I shall go to him,
That he will not return to me ;
Yet tears a father's eyes will dim
To think the usual destiny
Rjversfed is—that I still waken
To light and life while he is taken.
In Nature’s wonted course the first
To breathe or bloom is first to fall,
But what the best fate is, or worst,
Is hidden from the ken of all—
To lag till eve’s chill tempests blow,
Or in the golden morning go—
Go from this daylight to that dark,
Or from this gloom unto that glow ?
Descend the pit, or reach the Ark,
Conceive all things or nothing know?
We daring doubt or trembling trust,
Nor pluck its secret from the dust.
Oh, let the trustful part be mine,
While Doubt's dark demon flies afar !
For me let Faith’s bright beacon shine
Serene and pure as morning’s star,
Be mine the hope—nor be it vain—
That I shall see my boy again.
Not as my eyes beheld him last
AVith death-white cheek and glassy eye,
But in the Eternal Mould recast
And stamped with Immortality !
Be mine the bliss to hear and see
My child—an angel—welcome me.
And take me gently by the hand
And lead me to Our Father’s breast,
When I, too, reach the mystic land
And learn the secret unexpressed—
Faith, Hope and Love all whisper me,
“ There is such joyance yet for thee.”

A large number of the Melbourne lawyers
having struck against the solicitors practising
in the higher Court as permitted by the new Act,
the latter are arranging to import a consign-
ment of cheap barristers from the United King-
dom on three years contract. They will be kept
in a wooden barrack behind the Law Courts, ex-
cept in vacation time, when they will be turned
out into a grass paddock at Dandenong. Each
solicitor will brand his barrister so as to prevent
undue frauds and misconceptions. The new con-
signment will be quarantined on arrival as a pre-
caution against pleuro pneumonia. Any barrister
found loose in the streets without a muzzle will be
immediately destroyed, and the owner of each one
will be required to pay a license-fee of 4s. per
annum. Up to . date the scheme promises well,
though the first of the consignment unfortunately
proved a confirmed buckjumper.

“He was not useless drunk,” “he had

charged with any indictable offence, he is always
careful to add that “ the prisoner was quite sober

The once powerful Degraves familj at
last completely tottered to its fall. Old Peter
who had the mill in Hobart (and had pretty good
cause to remember it too, of which more anon !)
was the founder, and left four sons, Henry, (who
died in the fifties), John, Charles, and William,
all defunct in later years. John and Charles were
unmarried, and William married an impecunious
lass when quite an old man, leaving no issue.
Lady Wilson, the widow of Sir J. M. Wilson, is a
daughter of old Peter’s, and now that her two
sons are dead all hope of even indirect continua-
tion of the family has died out. When the
William Degraveses got into Victorian society
they started to spell the name “ de Graves,” but
those who knew the lowly origin of the family
only laughed at it.

Helen Faucit (Lady Martin, wife of Sir
Theodore Martin, who “ghosts ” the literature of
Queen Victoria & Co.) has just written:—“The
ancients knew nothing of the passion of love in its
purity, its earnestness, its devotedness, its self-
sacrifice. It needed Christianity to teach us
this.” True love, then, is not world-wide and the
property of all times and all races, but is the
appanage and corollary of a mere dogma. Carry-
ing this to its logical conclusion, no one can love
properly without belonging to the Established
Church of England, of which Queen Victoria is
the present and Albert Edward (Lady Mordaunt’s
platonic friend) the future head !

with a starting crowd of 30 in the steerage. She

accommodate only 20. Every meal had a free

A true story of this Christmas. Two

to buy Christmas-cards for each other. Just as
she entered the shop he departed. When she
reached the card-counter she found all the shop-

to ask for the joke. “The gentleman that’s just
gone out, miss, told us he wanted cheap cards
that looked dear.” She bought four cards for a
penny. The New Year opens for both with a

A petition in bankruptcy was presented at
Sydney the other day against Mr. C. H. Jean-

The rest of the creditors had unanimously agreed
to give Mr. Jeannerett time, and one of their
number came forward and tendered in gold the
amount claimed by Hunt and his friend. The
money was declined, and Jeannerett’s attorney
enquired indignantly what more the small minority
of creditors wanted than their money in hard
cash. Nevertheless, Hunt and his friend per-
sisted in their claim, and said that they had
‘'rights under the Bankruptcy Act” to make
Jeannerett insolvent. The case was adjourned,
Mr. Jeannerett, who has ever sustained his reputa-
tion as an honorable man, will have the sympathy
of every one in this matter.

They don’t eat rice to any great extent
now at the Mein telegraph-station on the Cape
\ ork line; they had a substantial meal of it in
1887, and have never quite recovered since. The
line was just finished in those days, and the Go-
vernment inspector came along with a party of
officials to survey the work. The .operator in
charge resolved to give his visitors a wild, im-
perial banquet of beef and rice—only, as it hap-
pened, the beef was all gone, so he concluded that
the only thing left was to have a riotous burst of
rice. Therefore he issued orders to his principal
supporter, one Kelly, to boil rice for ten, and
Kelly filled a huge billy to the brim with the re-
quired vegetable and water, and put it on the
fire. Pretty soon it began to swell up in an awe-
some manner, and Kelly hastily emptied it into a
kerosene tin, put in more water, and made a fresh
start. It boiled over the top of the kerosene tin,
and Kelly called out wildly to the saints, filled
the billy again with the overflow, and commenced
to boil the two of them. They both slopped over
in about two minutes, and the frantic Kelly, hav-
ing no time to run for more kerosene tins, filled
up sundry battery cells and insulators. Then he
saw that the rice was still “ cornin’ at him,” and
he filled two dozen insulators, and thus secured a
respite which enabled him to run for some more
billies. The dinner party arrived about this time,
and surveyed the scene. There was rice—un-
limited rice—everywhere, enough to feed a hun-
dred men and horses, and sufficient over for a few
famished camels and a team of bullocks. There
was rice in billies, kerosene tins, insulators, cells,
and tin pans, rice in the fire, rice on the floor, and
the walls and the roof, and other places. And in
the middle of all this rice stood Kelly with an
awe-stricken expression on his countenance, swear-
ing faintly and holding six more insulators like a
man who was prepared to die in the last ditch in
a frantic conflict with rice.

Glimpse into a factory-girl’s life in the
capital of Sunny N.S.W. : —“I go to the factory
at nine in the morning, and work on till five next
morning three times a week ; the rest of the week'
I work from nine till eight at night. I have to do
it, for there are plenty to take my place if T com-
plain.” The heart-breaking vocation of the street-
walker is far healthier than such a life : to the
broken slave of the sweating system, virtue is a
tyrant more inexorable than shame.

Dear Bulletin. —Will you permit me to
inform, through your columns, the numerous
country newspaper proprietors of the Australian
provinces who have recently issued copies of an
alleged “Christmas Supplement” with their
journals, that, as soon as my solicitor returns to
Sydney from his holiday vacation, I will cause to
be forwarded to each and all of them a formal
daim for infringing my copyright, Messrs,
I lifer, Publish & Co., “the enterprising news-
paper supplement proprietors,” have made a slip
this time. They did not content themselves with
stealing from American and English “ Christmas
numbers ” of past seasons, but have also re-
printed Australian copyrighted matter. For
which proceeding I beg leave to thank them
through your columns, for they have done a
genuine service to Australian literature thereby ;
and I, as one of the fools who starve genteelly
under the style of “ Australian litterateur” do
not intend to under-estimate that service on the
ground that it has been involuntarily rendered.
Messrs.P., P. & Co. have supplied the opportunity
(for which I have been long hungering) of taking
into court the literary pirate. That is their
service to Australian literature. It is their only

Copyright.
Mrs. Fanny Dent, wife of a gentleman
employed in the Lambton colleries, kindly allows
us to publish the following facts of her interesting
case and wonderful recovery, which we gather
from her correspondence, and which we shall be
glad to allow anyone to peruse who wishes to do
so. Mrs. Dent has been in a state of extreme
debility for twelve years, frequently quite unable
to do any work, the lightest kind causing great
fatigue, with severe pains in the limbs, back, and
left side. So severe was the pain that she would
have to sit or lie down frequently. Walking
exercise was very trying and she could only walk
very slowly. She had long seen Clements Tonic
advertised, but like many more people, her
husband was prejudiced against “ patent medi-
cines,” but (now we use her own words) “ I knew
some one who had tried Clements Tonic, and I
decided to get a bottle on the quiet and say
nothing about it if it did me no good. The effect
I thought something wonderful. I felt better
after the first dose, and by the time I had taken
half a bottle I was a different woman. My
husband, friends and neighbours soon noticed the
change in me, and they could not make it out. I
had to tell the truth that it was Clements Tonic
that was making me strong. 1 could not keep
the secret, I was only too glad to give the credit to
Clements Tonic. After finishing the bottle, work
was no trouble to me, but rather a pleasure, and
after doing a heavy day’s washing I could go for a
walk instead of having to go to bed, as always
happened before taking Clements Tonic. One of
my neighbours said to me last week— 1 Why, Mrs.
Dent, you are doing wonders this week, how is it
you are so strong now ? ’ She knew I had done
more that week than I had been able to do in 12
years before (she had known me this time, for I
am an old resident of this locality, having lived
here for 15 years). I replied : 1 Yes, I feel a
wonder to myself, so I’ll tell you the secret; I
have been taking Clements Tonic, and I cannot
tell you the benefit I have derived from it. You
know what my sufferings have been, and now I
have a genuine taste of good health.’ ” Mrs. Dent
wrote us those particulars of her remarkable cure
in March. She wisely, however, decided to con-
tinue the medicine to “clinch the cure” as it
were. Some time afterwards she wrote as
follows “ Waratah Commonage, N.S.W.,—
Dear sir,—lt is with great pleasure that I pen
these few lines. I have been as you know a great
sufferer from weakness and debility for years. I
was under several doctors, but they never did any
good. I despaired of ever being better, but as I
stated in my last letter I saw Clements Tonic
advertised. I tried a bottle and its effect was
something wonderful. I felt better almost im-
mediately, and was a new woman after finishing
the first bottle. Before taking Clements Tonic it
was a great trouble even to do a little house-work,
but afterwards my work was a pleasure, and my
friends and neighbours were surprised at the
change in me. I cannot say too much in praise of
it, and can only gratefully describe my case and
strongly advise all who suffer from weakness,
backache, pain in the side, ringing noises in the
ears, and shortness of breath to take Clements
Tonic. I feel sure it will do them as much good
as it has done me.—Yours gratefully, Fannv
Dent.”
No sufferer from any scrofulous disease, who
will fairly try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, need despair of
a cure. This remedy purges the blood of im-
purities, destroys the germs of scrofula, and
infuses new vigor throughout the system.

Modernised version o i “The gvauw are
tour.” Jilted Lover ; “ The tar; is tar:.”
On the directorate of the numerous bogus
“ National ” and “ Patriotic ” Associations which
have lately sprung into existence to combat the
Australian democratic movement, there is not
one-man who would not vote for making Aus-
tralia into a monarchy, or who would not to-
morrow throw up his hat for another freebooting
expedition to the Soudan.
Chief Justice Lilley (Q.) : “I look upon
every attempt made now to bind the colonies
closer to the mother country as an advance
towards the absolute independence of Australia.
. . . . Instead of getting nearer to England
we are getting farther off, because one generation
of natives after another knows less of England
and feels less affection towards her. That is the
cause that is making us distant. . . . What-
ever physical means may be employed to con-
nect the two countries in regard to time and
distance, you can never bridge the distance which
is created by remoteness of birth and different
ideas, by diverse interests, and the distance of
blood, by the intermixture of other races—
European races that have no sympathy with
England—and the growth of adverse interests.”
The Theatre Royal Hotel, Sydney, has
lately changed hands, and is now under entirely
new management. A splendid stock of wines,
spirits, liqueurs and cigars has been laid in, and
an altogether new feature is provided in the shape
of an American bar, where all the strange, curious
and refreshing drinks known in the United States
can be obtained. Their name is legion, but among
them may be mentioned champagne cocktails,
gin fizz, milk punch, mint julep—probably the
noblest liquor known to man —imperial punch,
Manhattan cocktails, and many others. All
mixed by American bar-keeps. James A. Walsh,
proprietor, late of the Occidental Hotel, San
Francisco.*
GRATEFUL ATHLETES.
The followingspontaLCOus expressions of athletic
gratitude are taken from the recent issue of the
MANCHESTER ATHLETIC NEWS ;
Mr. E. E. Painter (of London Athletic Club
and Ranelagh Harriers), 55, Finsboro’-road, South
Kensington, writes: “I have been suffering
from a sprained tendon for the past three months,
and have tried every remedy I could think of, but
none have done me any good. About a month
ago I was recommended by a fellow-athlete to try
St. Jacobs Oil, which I applied at once, and it did
me so much good that I shall in a few days
commence running again. Shall recommend it to
all my fellow-athletes as being the best remedy I
have ever tried.”
Mr. G. Smith, of Handsworth Friary Football
Club, 18, Carlyle-road, Handsworth, Birmingham,
says : —“Not long ago I received a severe sprain
in my ankle while on the football field, which
wholly disabled me from walking. The ankle
was much swollen, and very painful. Learning
of the virtue of St. Jacobs Oil in such cases, I
procured a bottle and applied the contents
regularly for one week to the ankle, by which
time the swelling and pain had wholly disappeared,
and I was able to walk. I have also found the
oil a most excellent remedy for toothache and
headache. I have, therefore, no hesitation in
recommending the oil to football players, as well
as all persons suffering from pain,”
Mr, Thomas Charles Pallinger, the well-known
bicycle rider, of 16, High-street, Lewisham, not
only knows how to ride a bicycle, but he knows
the right sort of an embrocation to use after hard
riding. He says, in referring to a strained leg,
“ I have found St. Jacobs Oil has done my leg a
power of good. I shall continue to recommend'
your valuable embrocation to my fellow-cyclists,
as I consideivlt a splendid article for rubbing
down while training.” The Bicycling News,
x\pril 23, 1887, also says : “Mr. Pallinger, of the
Catford, asks us to thank the gentleman who
recommended St. Jacobs Oil to him.”
The fire brigade of the city of Birmingham has
reached an excellent state of efficiency. The men
are exposed to many dangers, and their arduous
work often brings about physical suffering. Ctiief
Engineer John Bellhouse, and Firemen Josiah
Bennett, Thomas Fidoe, Wm. Maeke, Win. Shaw,
and John Brittill write that they received great
benefit from the use of St. Jacobs Oil in cases of
severe pains in the back and knees, also tender
feet and other ailments. The wives of several
members of the department also say that in their
case a few applications of the oil cured tooth and
face-ache.

HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR FORTUNE.
If you are not up to time in all your engage-
ments, small as well as great, people soon begin to
lose confidence in you. A trifling sum invested in
a Waterbury Watch will help to save you from
being frequently misjudged, and may be the
means of materially improving your fortunes. It
is the very trifles of life on which success or failure
generally hinge. And if anything goes wrong
with the watch the owner has only to take or send
it to the offices of the Waterbury Watch Company,
at 56, Margaret-street, where it can be repaired
at a cost according to its requirements, but in no
case exceeding 2s. 6d., unless by mutual consent.
The cost of transmission by post or parcel delivery
on watches sent from the country must be pre-
paid, and a sufficient amount to cover return
charges and cost of repairs forwarded at the
time. If sent in the box in which the Waterbury
is s Id the postage fee (including registration) is
6d. each way.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
About the largest Rand wick gathering on record
was that which got together on Boxing Day. It was
dusty, and as hot as the murky bowels of Tophet, and
the public-according to the dismal jeremiads of the
B.M. Herald and the Jaundiced Telegraph -ought to have
been too miserable, owing to Protection, to turn up, but
they were there all the same. The Hurdle, which opened the
proceedings, was gathered in by the favorite, Mr. Lamond’s
Satyr, at a peaceful trot, with Bettina just visible on the
far horizon behind. The Plying Handicap was won by
another favourite, Autonomy. It was a good day for
favourites, and yet another one, Clark’sMoonray, scooped
the December Stakes. It was a rather uninteresting race,
for the winner took the lead at the start and kept it at a
great pace all through, Miss Letty was a moderate
second, and Dan O’Connor, an exhausted-looking Post-
master-General, toiled in an equally moderate third. The
other three starters were also moderate, and the time was
Imin. 2jsecs., being within } second of the 1887 record —

8 to 1 for the Summer Cup, but his name or some-

Eurolgi fell likewise. So did General Gordon. Cascade

and, finally, Bella won, and Silvershot got in second, but
was disqualified for being short of weight. Autonomy

Buchanan, amateur lightweight champion of
Queensland, and Ned Burden furnished the “event.of the
evening” on Monday, atSydney Amateur Gymnastic Hall.
It was hard work for Buchanan, who ran after Burden till
he was really dead beat, and seldom overtook him. It was
also dangerous for Burden, for if he had fallen in getting
away, Buchanan might have run over him in his haste
and broken his back. This disaster, however, was hap-
pily averted. In the fifth round Burden got a gentle
concussion on the jaw, and sat wearily on the floor till he
was counted out. “No fight ” wasdeclared.

Quoth a sad-looking bookmaker at Rosehill, the
Other day: “ There’s nothing for the ring ot the owners
in pony-racing now. The incarnadined public is too
Clever. Here’s a field of 18 prads ahd Only three of them
are backed and the whole three are jigging. How the —-
they smell it I don’t know. Fancy 15 dead uns in your
book and not a chance to lay one of them ! Then it you
own a horse and have had him stiff for a twelvemonth,
the first bet you take brings the odds to B to 4, and that's
buying money. Why, the Other day, t was spieling a
pony of mine arid wanted to back him for £4OO. I only
got £5O wheh the public tumbled so I just had to whip
pound arid get £2B each frotn two ot the chaps to keep

There is, indeed, no good reason for increasing
the salary of the N.S.W. Sergeant-at-Arms from £490 to

everywhere, beginning at Montreal with, “ I thank you
for the honour you have done me, and I do not expect to
see better bowling anywhere than I have seen at Mont-

bowling and substituted batting, or fielding, or ladies, or

Sydney Telegraph, in an utterly reckless
burst Of truthfulness, publishes a cablegram

Clever old Billy Coote, (now verging on
the seventies) the apostle of N.Q. Separation, has
gone into the Townsville Hospital in order to
undergo a surgical operation. He is an architect
by profession, and, in the day of Brisbane’s small
things, he designed that city’s Town Hall. He
has edited several papers, written a History of
Queensland, is considered an authority on finance,
and has wet-nursed the Northern Separation
movement ever since its first teething. He has
likewise been a member of Parliament in his
day.
Sir John Hay is, as we write, so ill that it
is utterly unlikely he will ever be fit for work
again : and so the N.S.W. Government will, in
all human probability, soon have to sele<3t another
President for the Legislative Council. Who
will it be? Does the Ministry intend allowing
a tricky, dry-as-dust Tory like A. H. Jacob to
slip into the position into which they should dump
a strong-willed Radical—-the sort of man who, in
the outraged eyes of the Chamber of Senile
Debility, would look like a dynamite shell with a
short lighted fuse in full sizzle? Will the
Ministry put in the chair a man like Dr. Garran,
and thus, in a roundabout way, reflect honour upon
the S.M. Herald, whose proprietary have of late
been systematically letting loose on the com-
munity the mangy dogs of sectarian strife ?
Where is the strong popular man in the hey-day
of his powers whom the Ministry can appoint to
the Dead House of N.S.W. politics, and to its
Presidentship? How we long to see such an
unspeakable blasphemy committed!
Oscar 11., monarch of Sweden and Norway’
has pegged out and left a frozen throne vacant in
Scandinavia. Pretty nearly every paper in Aus-
tralia has already written his obituary, and they
all point out that he was the grandson of Marshal
Bernadotte, who was raised to the Swedish throne
by Napoleon I. He was the grandson of Berna-
dotte right enough, but the rest of the story
shows that the journals are woefully weak on
history. If there was one man in all the earth
whom Napoleon loathed it was Bernadotte,
and when that oily Iscariot cajoled the Swedes
into making him their King, he stood a good
chance of being hanged by Bonaparte before he
got away to occupy his new throne. As it hap-
pened, however, he did get away, and lived to
organise the campaign of Moscow, which wiped
out Napoleon for ever. Every Englishman
believes to this day that his country extinguished
the great Corsican, but it was the Russian war
that did it, and it was Bernadette’s brain that was
the cause of the disaster.
Extract from S.M. Herald leader of 26th
December, written by the man who sits in the
office and imagines his facts and makes his
circumstances to measure :
The community has this year been made to feel the
weight of the new taxation most unpleasantly. A visit
to any of the drapery and other establishments of the
city on Christmas Eve would not have been a pleasant
experience to those who take a delight in beholding a
contented and a happy people; for probably in the
history of the colony no such manifestations of dissatis-
faction have ever been heard before on Christmas Eve
from the wives and families of the working-classes. It
was impossible for the blandest of shop assistants to make
palatable the price of goods raised in some instances as
much as 30 per cent.
Another extract, in the same issue of the same
paper, from the report of the man who went
about the city and took observations :
Christmas of 1891 in Sydney and New South Wales has
been happily celebrated, and the holiday has fortunately
been free from any untoward circumstance. The past
few months, pregnant as they have been with commercial
disabilities and the effects of a wave of influenza, do not
appear to have materially interfered with the observance
of the year’s great festival.
There is considerable lamentation and
wringing of hands among the Low Church believers
of Ballarat since a local brass band started opera-
tions on the Day of Rest. Eor some time past
Ballarat has been saving its soul in a monotonous
manner, and the spirit of the ungodly old times
was reckoned to be almost dead when these in-
fidels came along with their tinkling cymbals to
give the Sabbath —i.e., the first one in every
month— a bit of a shake up. The usual sad
effects resulted. Scores of old men who used to
stop ab home and get religiously drunk every
Sunday afternoon, now find a sober worldly
pleasure in listening to the band in the Gardens
on these special occasions. Youths and maidens,
who formerly kept their tryst ab afternoon
service, have fallen into an evil way of making
appointments to meet near the big drum, or just
behind the conductor. Consequently business is di-

Also the Bible classes show a falling off in attend-
ance directly the Devil comes along to seduce the
infant mind with wind instruments. This is

When Daintree, the explorer, was Queens-

Gilbert rush, he gave the diggers a lecture on the
features of the field, pointing out that it was only
in the gullies where the overlying conglomerate
had been eroded that gold was found ; and that,
in process of time, as more and more of the con-
glomerate was washed away, there would be
more gold to be got. “So you see, boys,” he
concluded, “the field is really too young.” The
explanation was respectfully received, though full
of scientific terms which not one man in a
hundred understood. One digger pondered over
it for two days, until light flashed suddenly upon
him. “ I say, mates,” he burst out, “you know
what that blank geology-man said about the field
being too young. You know it’s all small stuff
we get here. What he means is we should leave

THE PKINOE OF WALES SPEAKS ON
HEALTH.
In his able and timely remarks at the opening
of the International Congress of Hygiene, at St.
•James’s Hall, London, August 10th, 1891, the
President, the Prince of Wales, said ; —“ The
highest possible prosperity is when rich and poor
alike can do such useful work as they are fit for,
and to this end it is essential that they should enjoy
the best possible health and vigor.
Very true, but how can the public health be
best promoted ? Clearly by such preventive
measures as the Congress meets to consider, and
by reliable remedies so long as certain diseases
continue to prevail.
We submit an example of the latter necessity in
the form of a statement which cannot fail to con-
vince the minds of all who may read it.

I, Margaret Morland, of Throstle Nest Farm,
Haya Park, near Knaresboro’, Yorkshire, do
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows : —
“I have suffered all my life from a weak
stomach, indigestion and liver complaint. I was
never properly well but always ailing and never
seemed to gain strength. I had a bad taste in the
mouth and a strange sinking feeling at the pit of
my stomach. I had always pain after eating, no
matter how simple the food was. My appetite
was poor and what little I ate did not seem to
give ine strength. I had great pain at the chest
and sides and felt as if I was held or bound round
my waist. I was much troubled with sickness
and very often found no ease until I vomited all
the food I had taken. I felt low, weak, and de-
pressed, as if something was hanging over me. I
could not sleep at night, and got so bad that I
even dreaded going to bed, for I would lie awake
for hours together, and on rising in the morning I
felt more tired than when I went to bed. As
years went on I became a bad colour, my skin and
particularly the whites of my eyes were tinged of
a yellowish colour, and at times I was as yellow
as a sovereign. In August, 1880, my stomach
became very irritable and everything that I took
turned sour on my stomach, and I was constantly
vomiting a foul bitter fluid or gas. I took little
or no nourishment, and after each morsel of even
liquid food I strained and vomited as if my
poor inside would come out. The pain at
my heart now became so severe that I be-
came alarmed and sent for our doctor, who
attended me for ten or twelve weeks, but all the
medicine he gave me did no good. The doctor
seemed puzzled with my complaint and changed
the medicine over and over again, but still I got
worse instead of better. At last I lost all faith in
physic and gave up taking it. Now better, now
worse, I continued until July, 1888, when my
kidneys became affected. I had dreadful pain in
the back and could not void my water. My skin
was dry and hot, my lips parched and feverish.
After a time the water lodged so bad that I
thought I should have died. I grew weaker and
weaker every day, and felt that if a change did not
soon take place my condition would be critical, for
the pain was more than I could bear. I could not
even bide tolie in bed, and had to get out of bed and
walk about the room. I took all kinds of medi-
cines, but nothing gave me more than temporary
relief, and I dragged on in this miserable state
until December, 1888, w'hen Mr. Day, the chemist,
at Knaresboro’, sent me, a book telling of a medi-
cine called Mother SeigeTs Curative Syrup, and I
read of a case similar to mine having been cured
by this medicine. I determined to try it, and
sent to Mr. Day and procured a large bottle of the
Syrup and commenced taking it. I soon began to
find relief, my food digested better, and gave me
strength, all pains in my back and sides left me.
I could now sleep better and gradually gained
strength every day, and by the time I had taken
a Is. fid. bottle I was better than ever I was in my
life, and by taking an occasional dose I have since
kept in good health. I may mention that I paid
over six pounds to one doctor and did not receive
any benefit whatever. I feel very grateful for
the great benefit I have received from Seigel’s
Syrup, and I wish others to know of it. I have
recommended the medicine to many people in this
district with great benefit. My daughter, Mrs.
Ware, living at York, was cured of severe dys-
pepsia after every other means had failed. If by
publishing this statement others may be benefited
I shall be very glad, and I hereby give permission
to the proprietors of Seigel’s Syrup to make any
use they may think fit of this testimonial, and I
make this solemn declaration conscientiously be-
lieving the same to be true. By virtue of the
Provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1835
(William IV. c. 62).
Declared before me at Leeds,'
in the County of York, by
the said Margaret Morland,
on Monday, the 10th of -
August, 1891.

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is wasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, woollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ;do large cording; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make, button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating I . —ln our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, sorew-s, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in tho
pound.

Ayer’s Sarsapari I la
Is everywhere recommended as the best rem-
edy for the cure of scrofula, scrofulous and
cancerous humors, chronic catarrh, eczema,
boils, pimples, sores, and all disorders origina-
ting in impure blood. It neutralizes and elimi-
nates the acids that cause rheumatism, gout,
and dropsy. It regulates the liver and kidneys,
gives tone to the stomach, increases the appe-
tite, aids digestion,
Cures Dyspepsia,
and makes the weak strong. No other blood
purifier is composed of such carefully selected,
highly concentrated, and skilfully united in-
gredients. For nearly half a century this prep-
aration has. in both hemispheres, been the
standard tonic and strengthening medicine. It
is universally approved by the medical profes-
sion, and benefits the enfeebled system at all
seasons of the year.

Slab from a speech on the World’s Fair
by Colonel Elliott F. Shepard :—
I believe firmly that if the Pair is not closed on Sundays
the Lord will put his curse upon the enterprise and on
the nation. He will send plagues and pestilences as He
did in the days of Pharaoh. If, on the contrary, the gates
are closed on Sundays, the Lord will bless the Fair and
make it the grandest success possible.
ThegreatcotswsheW'iinaN.S.W. Government
department is settled. Harrie Wood’s vanity has
been soothed by being dubbed Under-Secretary
for Agriculture; and henceforth and for ever
that hitherto important official, the Dh’ector of
Agriculture, will not have the ear of the Minister,
but will address the Minister on paper through
Under-Secretary Wood ! Hurrah for Red-tape !
In a South Australian court re a charge
of having passed a valueless cheque —Witness ;
“Yes, yer Worsh’p, an’ I give ten lovely John-
Dunns for the darn thing.” This was evidently
a witness reminiscent of the old days when small
bags of flour (501b. or thereabout) were £1 each,
and as John Dunn & Co. had the monopoly of the
Croweater’s flour-trade, a “John Dunn” and a
“ note” became convertible terms.
The latest “loyal” yarn is that the
Princess of Wales has induced her brother-in-law,
the Czar, to kindly refrain from persecuting any-
more Jews. What a text for a sermon on the
iniquity of absolute monarchy ! And what a
nasty jar for the Czar’s wife, also for a whole
heap of other relatives, Russian and English, who
either didn’t want him to be “nice” to the
Hebrews, or forgot to ask him prettily. That
is—if the yarn were only true.
“Bah ! Your blow is enough to make
one ill,” said a Sydney drummer temporarily
staying at a Rockhampton (Q.) hotel. “ You
don’t know me, or you couldn’t say that,” said
Stilts ; “I could buy up a hundred men like you. ”
“ You can,” yelled the drummer, assuming fury,
‘ ‘ you can ! Buy me then,! I’ll show my money
against yours—cash down—and the man who has
the most takes the two lots and pays for drinks
and cigars all round.” “Done!” eagerly ex-
claimed Stilts; “and I’ll go first show.”
“ Right.” Stilts put down a £100 note, some
fifties, twenties, tens, fives and ones, and some
miscellaneous gold and silver. The drummer
counted it carefully—“£623 14s. 9d.” Then he
plunged his hands deeply into his pockets and
pulled out—one solitary threepenny bit, saying :
“Just my luck! You’ve won, of course; take
the money, and pay for the drinks and cigars,
please.”
A Maoriland correspondent writes :—
Dear Bulletin, — In your issue of the 7th inst. you have
manufactured a pedigree for Mr. Perceval, our new
Agent-General, which has an old-country ring, and far
too good for “Burke’s Colonial Gentry.” There was a
Mr. Percival, but he spelt his name Percival, and not
Perceval, as does our Agent-General, who owned a small
run in Canterbury, in the “ fifties,” and who subsequently
came, after the manner of most squatters, to financial
grief. This gentleman was a grandson of the murdered
Prime Minister of that name. I had for a time the dis
tinguished honour of employing him as a bullock-drover,
and I assure you that he could talk “ Egyptian ” with the
best of them. He went back to dear old Hingland, when
he came into money. Some years after, a colonial friend,
who had just returned from England, told me he had met
him at the “Darby,” where he was in some tribulation,
having had his pocket picked of a hundred-guinea watch.
Our Agent-General’s “ pa” was an old-time Christchurch
publican. Whisky-mills paid in those ancient times, and
Perceval, senior, made a pile, which he duly left his only
son. The said son married money and is now worth over
£100,000. So, as he is a very gentlemanly young fellow,
he will be able to, and, no doubt, will, do the thing pro-
perly as Agent-General. Mr. Percival is deservedly very
popular, and his appointment is approved by both poli-
tical parties. — Yours, &c., Pakbiia.
Pakeha’s theory seems to be that Perceval, the
Maoriland Agent-General, can’t be the grandson
of the murdered British Prime Minister, because
of the discrepancy in the spelling of the two
names; and that “Pakeha’s” personal friend,
Percival, the Canterbury squatter, is the genuine
individual because his name fits the case.
Only, as it happened, the statesman who
was shot some 80 years ago was not Percival but
Perceval, and if orthography counts for anything
it was “Pakeha’s” friend who was the bogus
person of the pair. The fact that the new Agent-
General’s father kept a public-house has nothing
to do with the case; The Bulletin simply stated
that the present Perceval was Spencer Percevals
grandson, and if the intervening generation had
shoved a mud-cart or been a dog-stealer it would
have made no difference.

GOWRIE’S LAST JOKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One by one the troopers dismounted and
handing their bridles to the solitary civilian of the
mrtv—the son of a “ cocky ” selector—who had a
c-rudee against Gowrie—they followed their
officer Sergeant Morris, across the Gluepot.
There was no finer bushman in the North-East
th in Morris. An importation from Ireland when
that small company of “Royal Irish” was intro-
duced in the Middle Fifties to give the tone of a
thoroughly disciplined nucleus to the reorganised
force he had rapidly adjusted himself to the con-
ditions of police life in the bush, and save for a
ti n ge the faintest tinge, of a soft brogue, he
might have been readily taken for a true gum-
sucker, so resourceful was he in meeting the claims
of duty in the range-country. There was no point
of colonial woodcraft that he did not aim to master,
and if, m his tracking, he fell far short of Ovens
Peter,’ the “ district tracker,” he was as keen to
pick up the impress of a hoof or a heel as many a
half-caste who had never left the native camp till
Her Majesty had enlisted him.
For six months, he had been hunting Gowrie,
the bushranger—“Joker” Gowrie—in the Ovens
and King Country. Gowrie knew the ranges as
the Kellys of a later day knew the Strathbogie
and Glenrowan land, and a pretty dance he had
led Morris. Still, the latter was not dismayed.
He swore to run his game to earth; his very
defeats and followings up of false scents increased
his knowledge of the country, and every fresh
turn of the hare, so far from “winding” or dis-
couraging the pursuer, brought him nearer the
J And now, at last, Morris felt sure he had nosed
the game to his hole. A streak of whitish clay on
a chair-rung, the scraping of a boot-heel, had done
for Gowrie.
# # *
The night before, the Joker had dropped
in his own peculiarly humorous fashion on an out-
lying camp of El-Dox’ado, and, after telling the
party to put their hands up, had, jestingly, re-
lieved half-a-dozen miners of their week’s earn-
ings. “ I’ll jest a-borrer it, mates, till I strikes it
rich in my own claim, or till my ship comes in
with a cheque from the Noble Hook, my honoured
paternal parient! An’ jest to show you as I’ll
pay it back honest, with iut’rest added, I’ll give
yer my I O XJ, sonnies. That’s all right, ain t
it?” „
He had laughed then heartily, so the miners
said, and had bade one of them write out an I O U
on a scrap of paper for a sum equivalent to the
estimated value of the gold.
“ Call it five ounces, all told, d’yer hear ? Five
ounces at three-fifteen —what’s that, mates —I
ain’t much of a hand at multiplyin’? I’m better
at sub— what’s that called ?”
“ Subtraction ! ’ not un gleefully said the scholar
of the party, who was quite in the mood to_ enjoy
the joke, inasmuch as his luck had been quite out
that week—it generally was, he being a scholar—
and his share of the gold was a few pennyweights
only. “Subtraction —that’s your dart. That,
and abstraction !”
“That’s it—that’s jest it I But trust to me,
boys, and I’ll see yer through. I’ll pay all back
someday, when my ship comes in. Now, write
that there dokiment, and I’ll sign it, d’yer hear ?”
The scholar, with a skimpy lead-pencil, wrote
on the back of an envelope the symbols of Mr.
Cowrie’s indebtedness.
“ Read it out, mister,” the rogue ordered.
“ 1 O il £lB 155.”
“ Put in ‘ sterlin’.’ Eighteen-fifteen sterlin’,
and int’rest to date of payment. I’ll be genu-mely
lib’ral with you chaps, I tell yer.” Not half a bad
fellow was Gowrie when you took him on his right
side.
The scholar put it down, and then Gowrie
ordered him to stand up “while he put his mark
to it.”
“ Stand yer there now —so. Hold it out!”
The scholar’s face had lost its pleasant aspect.
Holding out a scrap of paper in the flickering
light of a camp-fire ten paces away from a re-
volver was, it must be conceded, a situation
rather lacking in the finer elements of humour.
“Steady, now, sonny ! Don’t drop or rise yer
hand, dear, else I may take a joint of yer finger
orf as I ’fix my signature. Steady, now !”
Then he had fired, and a neat hole, just half-an-
inch from the tips of the scholar’s forefinger and
thumb, indicated that there are more ways than
even Micawber dreamt of of signing an lOU.
“There, now !” cried the genial rascal, “ that’s
Joker Gowrie’s or-to-graph ! Jest yer wait till
my ship comes in, and then I’ll redeem it. Now,
good-night, an’ pleasant dreams, an’ don’t none
of yer drop yer hands or stir from where y’are for
ten minutes, or else my mates as is sun-oundin
yer will drop yer ! Ta-ta ! Keep that dokiment
safe.”
Thereupon he had departed, and not till the
robbed men had heard the beat of hoofs on the
bit of corduroy road half-a-mile away did they
dare to let their hands fall. They did not know
that the Joker never went “partners,’’butalways
worked single-handed. “Yer can’t work one
brain into two pair of hands !” he remarked once
before he took to the roads, and on the roads he
had acted on that maxim.
* * *
Morris did know, however, that the Joker
always played a lone hand, and when the news
reached El Dorado police-station, and was then
“wired”tothedistrict head-quarters atßeechworth,
he did not bother about looking for three or four
men’s tracks. He and his men sought for traces
of one man only. And they had tracked them to
the near side of Gluepot Jim’s shanty by the
Ovens’ head-waters.
Gluepot Jim’s was on the verge of the quivering
half-mile stretch of glutinous, treacherous mud
that separates the foot-hills from the patchy
auriferous country— that terrible stretch, with a
central pit—the “ hell ”in the district vernacular —
which would suck todeath every man and beast who
wandered into its horrible slime. Nobody came to
El Dorado field that way—that is, nobody who
was tender as to his reputation for honesty. The
only persons who did so were the rogues who
desired to laugh at the law from a soft place, or
the fools who were desperately afraid of that same
law and proved their folly by running away from
its comparatively feeble terrors to the fastnesses
in the gullies and ridges which, for the weak
criminal, were haunted with ghastlier horrors
than any prison cell could hold. The gullies
were storm-riven and the crests of the ridges were
lightning - scarred, and gibbering held
carnival in them and oh them. For a fool to
seek a hiding-nook in those ranges was to sit him-
self down to a feast with Azrael. More than one
had ventured, and had come back after a week or
two’s sojourn with whitened hairs and bleached
face and limbs that trembled from other pauses'
than starvation; come back to give himself up
to the more merciful law. The foot-hills beyond
the Gluepot were bad for nerves that lacked sap
Now, Jim, so he himself said, pitched his shanty
of casuarixxa slabs there “ ’cos he didn’t go much on
company, an’liked his own thoughts an (adjective)
sight better than other folk’s gab.” That was his
account, but why,' in that case, did he get up
occasional tolerably-sized parcels of “ mixed ”
goods—dry, soft, and liquid ? Men didn’t pay
<£Bo a ton carriage from Johnny Fawkner’s town
—Jim was a Van Demonian and was therefore in
honour bound to speak of Melbourne as Johnny’s
city—for the pleasure of playing shop by them-
selves or of solitary drinking. Not a bit of it.
The miners and the police were as very unbeliev-
ing Thomases in the matter of Jim’s asserted
reasons, and as a simple fact their scepticism was
fully justified. Legal evidence that Jim was a
fence, and receiver of the proceeds of Gowrie’s
outlawish actions, and of the similar proceedings
of similar enterprising adventurers, was totally
absent, but the moral evidence was cogent.
Morris and Ovens Peter, hard pressing on
Gowrie’s heels at a few hours’ interval, had
tracked the upstanding chestnut which he was
riding when he stuck up the Reedy Creek mail-
man to the margin of a lagoon w'hich washed on
its other side Gluepot Jim’s horse-paddock. And
the chestnut’s imprints were found on the marshy
soil of the paddock— the imprints and nothing ,
but the imprints.
Gowrie was always well-dressed, yet he never
carried away clothing from the hawkers, “ com-
mercials,” and storekeepers. And when he bailed
up Stevenson’s traveller on the Bathurst-road, the
bagman mentioned to the police privately that he
would take his emphatic oath that the tweed-suit
worn by the ’ranger was one of a three-twelfths
lot he had himself looked out for Mr. James
Liddon, alias Gluepot Jim,
And, most convincing of all moral and immoral
evidences, was the circumstance of Gowrie's
ammunition. There was not a storekeeper in the
Ovens and King country who had not refused at
Morris’ request to order fresh supplies of Colt’s
revolver (“C.” bore) cartridges—not one, save
Gluepot Jim, and he had not been asked. Yet,
and notwithstanding this restriction upon com-
merce arid upon Mr. Gowrie’s desires to keep up a
good-stock of freshly-imported revolver-food, Mr.
Gowrie still dropped an occasional “C.”-bore
bullet intb people who had an absurd objection to
standing and delivering. Now, where did he get
his cartridges .from, except from Gluepot Jim’s ?
He couldn’t ride into Melbourne and get them.
Morris’ theory was that in the shanty by the
Gluepot was the key to Gowrie’s fortress, and
when, on the morning subsequent to the sticking-
up of the Rut-camp on El-Dorado, he was notified
of the occurrence, he made with his party of four
for Liddon’s. He had sent a trooper to bring one
of the stuck-up miners to the Gluepot so that he
might be at hand to identify the gold if it were
discovered ; and had also carried with him a
warrant fox’ search. The search was instituted,
but no gold was found—none, at least, that was
identifiable, and once more Morris was chewing
the bitter cud of defeat, when, leaning against
Jim’s table, he saw, on the lower rung of an
American chair, a white streak.
He'called the miner outside. “ Any holes sunk
close to your camp ?”
“Yes, one within 50 yards by one of our
mates.”
“ Bottomed ?”
“Yes, just bottomed.”
“ Any pipeclay about?”
“No doubt there must have been some. No
rain had fallen since the bottoming.”
“When Gowrie came suddenly upon you from
the scrub, did become from the direction of the
hole?”
The digger paused to recollect and then answered
in the affirmative.
The trooper returned inside the shanty, and
seating himself in the chair, stooped as though to
adjust the strap of his spur, but actually to
detach the white streak from the rung. As he
thought, it was pipeclay, and his heart plunged
to suffocation point for half a second as his touch
told him it was moist. Gowrie could not have
left the shanty more than a few hours, and Morris
knew as he closed his fingers on the sticky stuff
that he was closing them on the ’ranger’s life.
He looked at his troopers—three of them were
in the hut, and at a movement of his eyebrows
they gathered round Liddon. Then he himself
arose, and suddenly throwing himself upon that
unassuming individual, told him that he arrested
him for harbouring a felon.
“ Govvrie’s been here widin the last hour or
two, Liddon, and the game’s up. Take care
phwat you say now—anything phwat you say will
be used in evidence against you, me man !”
Beyond a pungent curse or two, the prisoner,
however, said nothing, and made no resistance
when he was placed, handcuffed, on the back of
one of his own horses, and-escorted in the town-
ship direction, and away from the Gluepot. On
the contrary, he rather seemed to enjoy himself.
“He would make the sit up, he would,
for coppin’ an innercent chap,” he smilingly told
the trooper who held his bridle, and he evidently
revelled in visions of substantial damages, till,
when a couple of miles’ distance separated them
from the Gluepot, at a word from Morris, the two
other troopers, Pete and the civilian, turned their
horses’ heads, and left a solitary constable to take
Jim to the nearest lock-up.
Then Jim growled savagely, “ Wot’s the
matter with him now, an’ where’s he orf ter?”
“Where? He’s going after Gowrie, of course
’cross the Gluepot, and. No, you don’t!
But Jim had.
He had no, sooner heard the Glue-pot
mentioned than he stooped over his horse’s
mane, clutched the bridle with his braceletted
hands from the trooper’s, grasp, and digging Ids
heels into the flank of the nag, was galloping back
to his shanty before the surprised mounted-
constable could draw his revolver. By the time
the latter had cocked his weapon, Liddon was out
of pistol-range, and well on his way to the Glue-
pot. Both horses went at a tremendous pelter
through the scrub and across the broken ground,
and the hoof-beats would have called the atten-
tion of Morris to the bolt, even without the report
of the six shots which the trooper rattled off in
quick, though ineffectual succession.
Morris halted and faced about his men, then
hailed the shanty-keeper to stop. “ Stop, or I
fire, Liddon !”
Unheeding, the words went by the rider, but as
he suddenly swerved to turn the wing of the little
troop, Morris’ bullet caught him on the right side.
But it did not stop him, and the ory of pain which
the wound wrung from him acted spur-like on his
steed. Taking off madly from the shelving bank,
it leapt mightily into the quaking, boggy slimi-
ness. A stupid, dazed blundering forward of
horse and man, and the of the mael-
strom of mud sucked instantly (so it seemed) the
poor animal down to the girths. It neighed
piteously, as it struggled, but sunk the deeper,
and then the troopers knew that, from intention
or not, Jim Liddon had plunged his horse into the
fathomless “hell” of the Gluepot. Jim himself,
bending on his saddle from blood-exhaustion

managed to pull his right leg from the stirrup and
to draw it over the horse’s back. Then he called
to Morris, who, with his men, had looked on in
silence for the few minutes that had elapsed,
“ Yer not goin’ to let me die in this damned muck
are yer, sergeant ?”
To the amazement, and, it must be said, the
disgust of his men, Morris replied with, as they
thought it, a shameful laconicness. “Yes!” his
lips snapping grimly, as he answered.
“An’me a-bleedin’ to death? Blast yer, one
death’s enough for most men, but yer want me to
die two ! ”
For response, the Sergeant dismounted and
handed his bridle to the “cockatoo’s” son, and
bade his men act similarly. To them he choose
in a low voice to justify himself for leaving Jim
unassisted in the mud of the Gluepot.” “ This is
his dodge to take up our toime, me men, and if he
mischanced into the hell he can shtay there till we
get back.”
“ It won’t take ten minutes to throw him a log,
Sergeant ! The horse is as good as gone, but the
man ”
“ No!” exclaimed Morris, sternly, “ we’ve lost
time enough ! ” But to the cocky’s son he said,
“ Tie the horses up,’Moore, and if you can get
any timber out to him, do so ! ”
* * •
Ovens Peter led the party across the Glue-
pot at the Sergeant’s “Forward!” A narrow
ridge of stiffer earth, now a foot wide and now
less, ran erratically in and out of the quagmire.
Over this, with gingerly tread, they went, followed
by curses from Gluepot Jim. At the further side
where the ridge ran into solid ground, Peter
picked up a track that was unquestionably
Gowrie’s, for the heel had sunk deep and the con-
tact of the instep had left another morsel of
whitish clay in the depression of the footmark.
The “ Unshling carbines ! ” of Morris showed how
he reasoned about this last trace. At any moment
they might come across, not Gowrie’s track merely,
but Gowrie himself. It might be hours, but, again,
it might be moments.
The ridge led into a- loathsome ravine, noxious
with rotten undergrowth where it was not
rendered almost impassable by granite boulders.
But still they went on not unintelligently.
Pete now gathered information from a
depression in some slippery mass of ground
creepers, and now Morris himself drew
an inference which elicited an approving
guttural from the tracker, from the circumstance
that the corner of a stony block was bare, while
the rest of the surface was lichen-stained.
A full hour had they tramped when Morris, for
the first time since he had observed the pipe-clay
streak on the shanty chair, grew doubtful of how
this man-hunt was to end. For the shadowing,
converging sides of the gully terminated in a
sudden curve at the face of a precipitous mass of ■
rock. It rose sheer eighty or ninety feet, and
none of the neighbouring trees approached near
its crest by some twenty feet. The mass appeared
to run to the right and left into dense timber,
through which, it was quite evident, no recent
passage had been made, as high and low the
straight, tall stems were meshed with a
myriad • fold tangle of creeping integuments.
Had they overshot the mark ? Peter main-
tained that it was not so, but “that Gowrie
fella-alonga here.” This was Morris’s wish and
belief, yet no professional acrobat could have
scaled that granite height, and nothing but a
snake could have wormed its way through the
undergrowth. Yet that intuitive glimpse of sue-
cess which he had caught in the hut had not
deceived him so far. He had Gowrie fast, though
he did not know it.
“We’ll take a spell here, men, for a bit,” he
said, and in the unguardedness that sprang from
his momentary sense of disappointment, he spoke
in a raised tone, and his men, responding instinc-
tively to his laxer mood, flung off the restraints of
silence and dropped, one after another, their
carbine butts on the stone. They were thought-
less of the noise, but the noise was to serve them
better than their caution.
The “ Open Sesame ” of the Eastern legend was
not more effective. That had given Jim’s signal.
A slight grating sound drew all eyes to a suture
in the rock ten feet above them. The crack
widened —disappeared in a gap a couple of feet
across, as a lump of stone was drawn inwards,
and from the aperture protruded the bushranger’s
head.
“What is it, Jim ? . . . My God ! ”
Smitten with the atrophy of a suddenly-created
fear, his head lolled outwards and downwards,
and he made no movement during that instant of
discovery, when if safety were possible, it lay in
immediate withdrawal.
“ Stand, in the Queen’s name ! ” cried Morris,
and in the lapse of a breath, two troopers had the
’ranger covered.
The challenge roused Gowrie from his fatal
apathy. His black beard shivered as his jaw’s
shook out their last joke.
“How the devil can I stand, seein’ as I’m stuck
here ?”
The hundred thoughts that can flash through a
brain in the thousandth part of a second, went
into and out of Morris’s mind. “ One hundred
pounds reward, dead or alive ! ” was the pro-
clamation as to Gowrie’s capture—give him
breathing-time and he might draw , back into his
hole and escape—his hiding hole might have
another outlet —or his hand might even now be
fingering a revolver trigger. And so he gave a
glance at the cocked barrels, and called : “ Fire ! ”
* * #
Gowrie never made another jest. But it
was a great consolation to Gluepot Jim that he
had made that last one.
When, late that evening, they gob back with
the body to the shanty, they found Jim, still
handcuffed, lying upon the floor. Young Moore
had managed at great risk to himself to get him
from the horse’s back to the logs he had thrown
out towards the “hell.” Once on firm land the
wound was staunched, but Jim had lost so much
blood that he had to be dragged to his own hut,
there to gasp existence slowly away.
They carried Gowrie feet first in the shanty,
his legs dangling over the crossed carbines which
formed his bier, his head covered by Morris’s
handkerchief.
Gluepot Jim turned his face feebly, as the
escort entered.
“Yergothim—then?”
“ Yes ! ” said Morris.
“Did —he - die—game?”
“ His last speech was a joke ! ”
The death-grey gave way to a bright gleam
“ Was —it —now? I’m damned glad—o’ that! ”
He closed his eyes, and his voice—and himself—
faded into nothingness. “ Mother—alius—said—
Jack —’ud die jokin’. We was brothers—Jack
an’ me! ”
Brothers in in life. Then Morris
and his men knew certainly why Jim had rushed
into the “ hell.” He had hoped to divert Morris
from immediate pursuit.

“General” Booth has cast a bilious eye
on the Australian Northern Territory. He writes
to Bray, S.A. Chief Secretary : —
Would it be possible to settle a colony of Hindoos in
your Northern Territory, supposing some form of land
cultivation could be devised by which they could live in
comfort, and become indigenous to the country? My
heart will be stirred by the awful poverty of some of our
poor people in Ceylon and elsewhere, and my notion is
that if we could form them into colonies where they c»uld
obtain a livelihood, we should not only bestow an un-
utterable benefit upon them materially, but also be able
to raise up and train from among them a body of Salvation
Army officers, who .would go back to India as missionaries
with far greater probabilities of success than Europeans
could possibly have.
Great heavens ! When will these bullock-like
English boobies understand us ! We have mur-
dered all the Australian blackfellows and don’t
want any imported niggers, any more than we
want to import glanders, or hydrophobia, or
leprosy, or the black-death, or the Guelph
family. So far as Australia is concerned, the
Indian niggers, of whom there are 260 millions or
so, may all die and be put through the bone-mill.
Let J. Bull take care of the carcases of the
miserable, spindle-shanked trash, whom he has
swindled and sweated in the name of God.
Two items from one issue of Lloyd’s
Weekly. (1) Joseph Atkins, aged 35, killed
himself in a fit of despair, consequent on the dis-
tress of his wife and five children, whom, owing
to his inability to procure work, he could not
feed. At the inquest it transpired that the man
and his wife were proud, and had, while enduring
the pangs of hunger, resolutely hidden their suffer-
ings from their neighbours. (2) The actors and
theatrical managers of London have bought a
£1000 be-diamonded gold cigar-box for the Prince
of Wales.—
How to Grow Rich. —Invest in land at
Perth, W.A. Plans from Intercolonial Invest-
ment Co., Limited, 309 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Any enterprising individual who wants to
get up a profitable industry and to fill a long-
felt want might probably organise a company
for facilitating the escape of bank officials,
building society directors, bogus land syndica-
tors, and assorted financiers in general. The
association could be officially known as the
Bankers Emigration Companv, Limited, with a
capital of (say) .£200,000, in 20,000 shares of £10
each. Its business would be to facilitate the
retreat of gentlemen in difficulties for a reasonable
cash consideration, paid strictly in advance. It
would, in the first place, pay a certain annual
contribution to a healthy and pleasantly-
located South American Republic, in return
for which that State would abrogate its extradition
treaties, and thus furnish a convenient refuge for
all clients. Any embezzler who desired to light out
for a safer land would send to the nearest branch
office and get its table of rates—furnished in
strict confidence. The prices, of course, would
vary. The man who hadn’t got much plunder
might be secretly painted as a nigger and shipped
per coal vessel from Newcastle, or he could be got
up as a Chinaman and started off by the regular
American mail-steamer to San Francisco. On the
other hand the rich shortage man would be
removed by special steam-yacht manned by the
company’s employes, and furnished with a secret
place of concealment down among the water-
tanks, so as to defy investigation if the vessel
were overhauled on the seas. The company’s
own officer would call round in the dead of night
with the appropriate disguises, and the escapee
would be put into the company’s special fast
vehicle, and driven like greased lightning to the
yacht, which would immediately get under weigh.
The police and detectives would be tipped by the
company in order to prevent interruption. If, by
any chance, a client were arrested before getting
away, he would be duly bailed out by the manager
or his agents, the forfeited bonds being included
in the bill. Underneath the office in each city
would be a number of secret apartments and sub-
terranean passages that would defy all ordinary
search, and any client who was surprised by the
auditors could sprint for this place and lie low
there till his escape was arranged for. Clients
who arrived without enough money to pay the
fees would be remorselessly thrown out by the back
door to take their chance. When an important
banker had to be removed from the vaults and
taken on board ship, and the policeman in the
street refused to be squared, or the depositors
were waiting outside with guns, the company’s
own sloggers would go out and cripple them, or
else a house would be set on fire in the vicinity to
draw off the attention of the public, or there
would be an alarm of murder round the corner, or
a cab would bolt, with the company’s own beauti-
ful female in it shrieking for help. In order to
preserve secrecy as much as possible, the company
would put up its signboard over an empty office
somewhere, and conduct its real operations in a
warehouse labelled, “British and Foreign Bible
Society,” at the other end of the city. In extreme
cases the doctor attached to the office would
certify to the customer’s death, and he would be
ostensibly buried in the public cemetery, and a
tombstone put up to head off the detectives. No
assassins or other vulgar criminals taken in on
any account.
A BOON TO HUMANITY
’Tis food for young and food for old,
It gives new life and vital power,
There’s nothing in the market sold
Like Pemell’s patent Snowwhite Flour.
Why heed the poor, who grin behind their bars?
The Turn is 50, Royal is his brood ;
What reck we now of widows’, orphans’ sears?
They’re better dead than whimpering for food ;
Now yearn our generous bowels in the mood—
A gold and jewell’d box for Turn’s cigars !
And so John Atkins freed his soul, and stood
Before a Judgment Seat beyond the stars,
And pointed to his family, famished, nude,
And then at Wales and his auxiliars.
Heav’n caught up Atkins in its fiery cars.
Hell turned itself, and waits—impatient, lewd.

Whereas, I suffered very severely from a very

Pony Racing.
It is doubtful whether there is any community in
the world where there are so many people who get
their living by sport as in Australia. Pedestrians,
pugilists, scullers, racehorse trainers, bookmakers,
horse-owners, jockeys—their name is legion.
Where the money comes from to support all these
people is a dark and inscrutable mystery. Times
are said to be bad. employment is scarce, and yet
there are race-meetings, for valuable prizes, held
nearly every second day. The gymnasiua can
fill their seats at half-a-sovereign a head to watch
a glove fight, and the totalisators drive a roaring
trade every Saturday forenoon. Probably the
worst and most degraded sport of the present day
is pony-racing, and to make it clear to the reader
how this amusement is worke % and what its
effects are, a short description of it will be given.
* » #
The Sydney pony-stables will be found in the
back streets about Surry-Hills and Redfern.
Generally they consist of an old, dilapidated
wooden shed standing right up to the foot-way,
and with the very merest apology for a yard,
space being valuable. On entering, the visitor sees
a collection of boys lounging abmit; these are the
grooms or stable-boys who look after the ponies.
They are all smoking or chewing tobacco, and
exchanging foul language. They are all physically
weedy, and unwholesome to a degree; they are
horribly dirty and slovenly in their dress; and
one feels ashamed to think that such creatures are
Australians. It is vain to hope that they will
grow into anything better. The constant sweating
and dosing to reduce weight, and the unhealthy
hours they keep, and the bad habits they get into,
destroy their bodily physique. As to morals, the
atmosphere of a training-stable is not conducive to
morality, at any time, and when one considers the
methods of pony-racing, as hereinafter explained,
it becomes evident that this sport is a finishing-
school for bad characters. Most pernicious of all
is the gambling, the element of chance and hazard
in which they live. Here are young boys betting
their half-sovereigns and sovereigns in the most
regal style, sometimes pulling off a good stake and
making more money at one swoop than they could
honestly earn in a month. Is it likely that they
will ever settle down to honest work ? They are
sportsmen, and work is not in their line. Their
example is copied by all the boys of their acquaint-
ance. As we go by, they discourse in nasal slang
whether such and such an animal was “ stiff ” in a
particular race, and they lounge on the ground
propped against the wall, and smoke and spit and
curse while we pass in to examine the ponies.
# * *
If the visitor expects to find ponies of the
generally recognised types—the sturdy Shetland*,
or the graceful Timor or Arab ponies—he will be
grievously disappointed. These ponies are all
undersized thoroughbreds, weedy and useles®. An
animal 58 inches in height is called a galloway ;
56 inches and under is a pony. They are all
measured by the official measurer of the pony-
clubs before being permitted to start racing, and
they are then allotted their respective classes. The
lower ponies get lighter weights, and to make them
measure as low as possible all sorts of devices are
resorted to. Their feet are pared right down to
the quick, and they are practised for several days
measuring under a bar consisting of a hot iron,
thereby learning to flinch away and stoop a little
when any bar is placed over their withers. Also
they are taught to stand with their legs straddled
out, and if this is not sufficient a strong dose of
physic is given, which has a curiously shrinking
effect on a pony. Even with all these aids to low
measurement it is difficult to believe that some of
the ponies were ever bona-fide and honestly
measured at their official heights. But from first
to last there is nothing honest or bona-fide in the
sport, so that to find a pony which looks fully 14
hands high rating as three inches under that
height is not at all marvellous.
# # #
The breeding and encouragement of these
racing ponies is likely to do immense damage to the
class of horses bred in the country. Real ponies
of the true sturdy types are amongst the most
useful animals that can possibly be bred. In hilly
districts they are twice as much used as horses ;
but these alleged racers are little, weedy, spindle-
shanked racing-machines, useless for any other
purpose. The weight of an ordinary man would
bi'eak the general run of them down in very short
order. Now and again, by a freak of nature, one
finds all the strength and speed and fire of a full-
sized horse packed into the compass of one of
them, and such animals would be useful enough.
But for one of these, dozens of weeds and cripples
are bred, and after being tried and found wanting,
are turned out to perpetuate their faults in their
offspring. So long as an undersized thoroughbred,
that can gallop with a featherweight up, can win
a stake of .£3O or so in a single race, these ponies
will continue to be bred. In the stables one finds
all sorts and sizes, from the galloways downwards
—all sleek and well-looking, though their quarters
are rather cramped. Beady black eyes stare at us
over partitions and through cracks in the wall.
Here is one pony that earned £SO in stakes in one
day lately by winning two races. Here is another
that is under a ban of disqualification. “Got a
sixer, this cove has,” says the boy in charge.
“ What for ?” is our reply. “ Wy, for not jiggin’,
of course,” says the young hopeful, with a look of
profound contempt. “ Got a sixer for not jigging”
means that the pony has been disqualified for
six months because his owner did not run him to
win. So we go the rounds of the ponies, not seeing
one that could be put to any practical use apart
from his racing capabilities, and take our leave,
receiving a contemptuous stare from the boys,
who are now playing pitch-and-toss in the yard.
# # #
At the pony race-meetings the stranger is
apt to get his eyes opened. From first to last he
will not meet one man who even supposes, in the
wildest way, that the ponies are run honestly.
“Is so-and-so on the job?” “What is going to try
for this race?” The knowing ones go round
endeavouring to get information from the owners
as to what is to win. They never ask straight out
whether the pony is likely to win. A straight
question and a straight answer would be too
foreign to the atmosphere of thieving, ramping,
and chicanery which surrounds the whole busi-
ness. They ask whether the pony is well, and the
owner says, reflectively looking at the ground,
that he is pretty well, but not so well as he might
be. Whiclji means that he has not made up his
mind whether the pony is to try or not, A pony
that is meant to win is “ very well ”; one that is
meant to lose is “ not at all well.” These answers
are by no means to be relied upon, as the owners
would rob their dearest friends if opportunity
offered. Pony-racing by the electric-light is a
recent development. The track is small, and the
ponies scamper round it at a tremendous rate.
* * *
The financial aspect of this business is worth
considering. One finds at a single meeting 140
ponies entered to run. Each of these costs,
at a low estimate, 30s. a week to train, Junk-
ing a total of over £IO,OOO for a year for the
ponies engaged in one meeting alone. The
number actually in training is probably three
times as many. The expenses for saddlery have
to be added on to the training charges, also
entrance fees, jockeys’ fees, &c,, &c. From £IOO
to <£lso is given in prizes at each meeting, and
there are two or three race-meetings every week.
The ponies command big prices, 70 or 80 guineas
being quite a reasonable figure for a really good
animal. The attendance at the meetings is
always large and consists exclusively of “ sports-
men”— people who go there to bet, and in the
hopes of making money. Where does all the
money come from to support these people and to
keep this sport going? The followers of the
business gamble with ponies just as card-players
gamble with cards. The people go to the meet-
ings just as they go to Monte Carlo, to get excite-
ment and win money, not from any love of the
sport. But in every card party there is someone
from whom money is *o be won, and Monte Carlo
would soon shut up if it were not for the influx of
foreign capital. Yet in pony-racing everyone
concerned seems to make a living out of it. The
money must come from somewhere. They could
not subsist long bv merely jobbing one another,
as the game is expensive and the capital of the
players is limited in the extreme. The outside
public does not contribute anything worth speak-
ing of. The same crowd turns np at each pony
meeting with monotonous regularity, and no
strangers are noticeable. Even if there were a
fixed amount of capital to start with, and they
won it from each other, it would very soon be
eaten up in feed bills. It is a mystery no one can
fathom, and the only consolation is that the
“sport,” like all others run in the same way, is
showing signs of decadence.

A Rockhampton bank-manager complains

may he perfectly new.” The DA. .Argus adds
that “other banks in town are adoptimr the same
c urse.” We pause to smile. We fancy we see
the associated pawnbrokers biting off their noses
to spite their faces—injuring their paper profits
by destroying their negotiable I.O.UV. They’ll
be bfagging next that they won’t let the public
hold their promissory -notes, but will insist on
every customer taking gold only.
