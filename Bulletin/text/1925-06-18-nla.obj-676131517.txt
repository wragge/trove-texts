HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes
CAUTION.—The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure to ge£
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You may
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good” as Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-
tions and substitutes have no reputation of
their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character .of Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes.

How to Woo the Written Word
“Literature, the form of art most readily
available, must be handled from the first
as the most direct and lasting communica-
tion of experience from man to men. It
must never be thought of or represented as
an ornament, an excrescence, a mere pastime
or an accomplishment; and, above all, it
must never be treated as a field of mental
exercise remote from ordinary life.” Thus
ran the recommendation of the British De-
partmental Committee of Education of 1919.
It is a high view, almost a counsel of per-
fection, and thus appropriate to the dignity
of the subject.
This authoritative pronouncement, which
the devotee of letters accepts with welcome
as formulating the right standard for educa-
tionists, condemns definitely and without
qualification the prevailing methods of in-
struction in English literature, namely, the
practice of treating the subject as one for
mere classroom ingenuity, in learning by rote
selected poems, analysing purple passage's
from the works of famous prose-writers and
writing set exercises on given points in the
course. The trouble inseparable from all
instruction in classrooms, and even lecture-
halls, is that it tends almo'st invariably to
be an attempt to impose something new and
hard upon generally reluctant, and often
totally unresponsive, immature and unpre-
pared intelligences; whereas the need is not
for driving in precepts in solid lumps, but
for “leading out,” and, by patient, discern-
ing, sympathetic encouragement, developing
the interest of the individual student in the
subject of study. A teacher may be master
of the subject; further, may be able to deli-
ver a clear exposition of it. But unless he
also-possess the very rare gift of arousing
and stimulating a willing interest in his
pupils, his efforts are foredoomed to be sadly
ineffective, at the best will leave only a tem-
porary impression.
Obviously this is far more certain to be
the case in tuition concerning one of the
great creative arts—the highest, ever-endur-
ing and ever-advancing developments of com-
bined intellect and emotion —than in instruc-
tion in the exact sciences. In the latter
emotion has no place; but it is the main-
spring of all great art. The teacher of high
literature has to deal mainly with -inspired
emotion ; and so difficult is the task of arous-
ing in the ordinary pupil an appreciative re-
sponse to the appeal of genius in the written
word that the question may well suggest
itself whether it is possible to instil by
didactic method any lasting appreciation of
a great art. At any rate, artistic taste is
not to be created by routine class instruc-
tion, however able and insistent the teacher.
Each pupil has individual capabilities differ-
ing, both in form and degree from those
of. liis classmates: while in some few the
soil will be naturally fruitful, in the majo-
rity it Avill be found barren and unrespon-
sive. But a right appreciation of our
national literature, “the form of art most
readily available,” as the British Depart-
mental Committee describes it, touching as
this influence does our common existence
at .many points, should not prove quite so
difficult to inculcate as the arts more remote
from daily life.
In the course of a recently-published re-
view of the state of British literature at the
present day, Mr. W. B. Maxwell, chairman
of the Incorporated Society of Authors (Eng-
land), after stating that there is more read-
ing by the public since the war, says: “But
in spite of the increased amount of reading,
it is doubtful if we have at all advanced
in literary taste. The fact is, we are not
yet a literary people. We talk about litera-
ture, we even drink its health at public
dinners; but it has a very small place in
most lives. We do not encourage it as the
French do, we do not love it as the Ameri-
cans.” Mr. Maxwell, however, finds pro-
mising indications of higher and more uni-
versal appreciation of literature in England
in the new reading habit acquired during the
war and still being kept up; also in the
more literary tone of newspaper articles and
the wide circulation of newly established
cheap periodicals devoted to literary matters.
It seems, then, that what remains is to
make the best kinds of English literature
popular by improving the taste of the in-
creasing bulk of the reading public; and
this task, as the Departmental Committee
lays down in the quotation that forms th»
text of this article, “must be handled from
the first”—that is, from the earliest teach-
ing. This is the desideratum for which the
education authorities—in Australia as in
the British Isles and every part of the Em-
pire—should strive as a main means for
the. intellectual advancement of the race to
which we all belong who speak the English
tongue. But this end will never be attained
by routinal and casual methods of teaching
by treating a great and intimate art of in-
calculable influence for good as merely a
subject of the school class or college course
These futile and fruitless methods must be
wholly discarded m favor of well considered
means for permanently interesting the stu-
dents, each personally and according to his
(or her) individual capacity, in the great
works of our great writers. In this wav
only can be engendered in the young the

“Lenin,” by Trotsky
The future organiser of the Red Army
was only 25 when he descended from a cab
m the early morning at a Bloomsbury
boarding-house and knocked the future dic-
tator of 180 millions out of his bed. Trotskv
had been expelled from school for desecrating an
ikon and had been condemned to exile in Siberia
for being concerned in a revolutionary plot
m Odessa; nevertheless Lenin found it neces-
sary to put him through a short catechism
m economics, and, finding him sound, made
him chief leader-writer for the Spakk the
incendiary journal he was editing in London
Less than a year afterwards they parted to
meet again in St. Petersburg in the abortive
rising of 1905; to separate again till 1917,
when the Kerensky Government signed its
own death-warrant by requesting the British
Government to release Trotsky, then a
prisoner in Halifax; and the Kaiser, by plac-
ing a special train at Lenin’s disposal to
convey him from Switzerland to Russia,
expedited his own abdication.
The title of this bit of biography, which
is the authorised translation and is pub-
lished by Harrap, London, is a misnomer,
llie book tells little of any value about the
anti-Christ of the Russian Revolution, be-
cause in that direction Trotsky’s vision is
dissolved in a haze of hallucination; but
it succeeds in revealing a great deal about
the writer. We see the interiors of dingy
London lodgings where Plechanof’s daughters
pass tea and cake. _ Lenin’s boots hurt him
at the opera in Paris, and he takes them off.
A printer, arrives from Australia and delivers
an oration, "quite revolutionary for that
period at least” ; after which everybody sang
"Almighty God, put an end to kings and
rich men.” Vera Ivanovna’s chief joys were
tobacco and mustard, but she was neverthe-
less a distinguished revolutionary. There are
endless, hair-splitting arguments about points
of doctrine; frequent • schisms; ceaseless
struggles for office in even the obscurest revo-
lutionary group; and one night a new revela-
tion in the algebraic expression of human
forces came to someone and they ate roast
meat en casserole in honor of it and joked
about whether Trotsky could find his way
home. Pathetically anxious the writer is
to get it all down right; nothing concerning
these people is really trivial because, in his
view, they are demi-gods and men and women
of destiny. Lenin, we learn, “is busy with
theoretical studies and passes much time
in the library of the British Museum.”
The rest of the story is a frank confession
of the measures taken by these gloomy
Hebrew fanatics to smash the new regime in
Russia in the pretended interests of a rigid
theory expressed in the pompous phrases of
a frozen German professor. As the revolu-
tion grows Trotsky’s blood-lust becomes more
vocal. “Fools ! Babblers ! Idiots !” shouts
the inverted wowser, presented with a whole
helpless nation to experiment on. “History
is made in the trenches where. .. .the sol-
dier thrusts his bayonet into the officer’s
body and escapes to his home village to set
fire to the manor house. Doesn’t this bar-
barity please you? Don't get excited, his-
tory answers you: just put up with it all.”
Lenin becomes to Trotsky the glorious em-
bodiment of all the forces of hate, 1 revenge
and savagery that Bolshevism aimed at re-
leasing ; he lias “the high-powered peasant
cunning, which amounts almost to genius,'
equipped with the latest acquisition of a
scholarly mind”: a terrible combination of-
spiritual dynamite to find such an opportunity
as the Russian revolution.
Out of that opportunity came seven years
of terror, at the end of which the Russian
people, the 180 million objects of experiment,
find themselves in much the same position as
when the experiment started. This aspect,
however, does not trouble Trotsky, and in a
final exordium to his party on the occasion
of Lenin’s last illness he puts the ethic of
Bolshevism in a nutshell. “No, comrades,
no! We are not degenerating. We change
our methods, ways of working—but the
revolutionary instinct of self-preservation of
the party is the highest thing for us. .. . We
will make a compromise with the peasantry
and the little bourgeoisie, we will yield to
the Nep people, but we will not allow the
Nep people and the little bourgeoisie into the
party.”
A feeble facetiousness masking a very real
ferocity is the main characteristic of Trot-
sky’s literary style. It is doubtless an index
to his character. The morons of a civilised
society break loose occasionally and rape an
infant or murder an old lady: it is given tc
few to operate on a whole nation.
M. G. S.
Expressionism and Tradition
In his “Expressionism and Australian
Drama” (R,P. 14/5/’25) Mr. Fitz Henry
declares that the ancient wisdom of the
theatre is summarised in the new German
cult of “Expressionism,” and that the
future of Australia’s theatre depends largely
upon the acceptance by our playwrights of
the standards imposed -upon the theatre by
the Continental stage-craftsmen and drama-
tists.
Precisely what Expressionism is it is hard
to say. In some respects it seems to be
a revival of the method used in writing the
mediaeval moralities. The players enact
their roles not as characters but as sugges-
tions of characters; instead of scenery, fur-
niture and ordinary properties, the expres-
sionist producer employs suggestive atmo-
sphere, symbolic costumes and an elaborate
lighting system. Kenneth MacGowan, an
American devotee, referring to the cult in
his “Theatre of To-morrow,” says that it
“applies to realistic plays as well as to plays
of spiritual emphasis, plays of color, imagi-
nation, exaltation, inner truth.... It does,
in fact, range from a beautiful realism to
absolute abstract form. Its one definite
limit cuts it off from the theatre of photo-
graphic realism. It is always and utterly
opposed to the copying on the stage of the
confusion and detail of actuality.” That is
as far as Mr. MacGowan goes in his explana-
tion. His book is devoted largely to descrip-
tions of productions by Reinhardt. Copeau,
Appia, Stanislavsky and other leading Ex-
pressionists. Georg Kaiser, the German
dramatist, is perhaps the most prominent
of the Expressionists, and the' rather vague
and nebulous theory is employed in “From
Morn to Midnight” and “Gas.” The former is
the long-drawn-out yell of anguish of a man
suffering from nerves, and “Gas” is a dia-
bolical medley of screams, foul odors, ex-
plosions and formalised puppets stripped
bare of all human resemblance. The dia-
logue is jerky and violent, and the play so
incoherent that it exhausts the strength and
interest of the spectator. Kaiser is so deter-

tlmy aS ‘‘First Man,” “The Lamplighter,”
“Old Woman” and so on.
This sit of thing is interesting as a
reaction," perhaps, but mankind is more in-
vested in useful ceremonies and well-
marked individualities than in formalities
and abstractions. Don Quixote Falstaff
Hamlet and Mr. Pickwick are beloved of
the world because their authors were at
Sains to make them human. They are not
expressions of abstractions, but actualities.
Eugene O’Neill, with his hairy apes, prosti-
tutes and consumptives; Kapek, with his
Robots and insects; Elmer Rice, with his
theory of man’s ultimate end as an addin„-
machine, are leaders in Expressionism.
Accordingly one arrives at the conclusion
that the cult finds room in its nebulous
bosom for impotence and primitivism and
negation. Yet Mr. Fitzllenry would look
to these men as the protagonists of the new
birth of the theatre, because embodied m
these men’s plays is the ancient wisdom be-
stowed on mankind by Dionysos at Sycyon.
One can readily believe these men to be anti-
vivisectionists, free-thoughters, prohibition-
ists and ardent admirers of Freud and Jung
rather than men living in poetry and music
and a world of color. Not one Expression-
ists play is healthy. Pirandello, remark-
able technician though he is, has eompio-
mised with the prevailing neurasthenic con-
ditions of life, and uses as themes the CRdipus
u”d Electra complexes. Wedekind special-
ises in sadism, abortions, lust, murder and
homosexuality. Toller writes sociological
propaganda plays in gaol.
Expressionism is valueless as a means ot
establishing a national dramatic system. Y\ e
may be disgusted with the parlous condition
of our theatre, but the frankly innocuous
musical comedy and the mediocre show-piece
are less dangerous artistically than the halt-
educated Tollers and Kaisers and the de-
mented Wedekinds and Pirandellos. The
destiny of our P»ritish theatre depends largely
upon our playwrights’ capacity for avoiding
the slough of pseudo-intellectual mediocrity
existing on the Continent. Our tradition
should be based upon the Elizabethan sys-
tem and not upon any other. We possess
the richest literary heritage of all the
nations in the world. Despite the. chaotic
economic state of the world, Britain is
supreme in letters. But if our writers be-
come enmeshed in the toils of those sadly-
shrunken gentry. Freud and Jung, and the
Continental theatre they have influenced so
profoundly, we will not have plays to de-
light our hearts and minds, but plays to
disturb our dreams o’ nights. Here in Aus-
tralia, even though we have so far missed
a dramatic revival, we can at least sleep
soundly o’ nights and dream of our maiden
aunts without any fear of having violated
the tables of consanguinity.
BYRON KERNET.
London and Me
After the Boxer War in China and after
enteric, malaria and a lecturing tour in
Maoriland, in which I magnificently lost
nearly all the money I had made, I decided
to go to London. In those delectable days
travel was cheap, and a man with a pen
had a chance to provide himself with ink.
So I made the grand tour, seeing the Con-
tinent, with the optimistic belief that I
should be at least able to keep myself when
my three months’ supply of cash ran out.
In a boarding-house in Holland Park, Wil-
liam Beattie and I used to lie in our beds
jvaiting for tlxe early postman. If we heard
a letter flutter into the box w r e were both
scrambling down the stairs to discover if
Our fortunes had been made —my play pro-
duced, Beattie’s novel accepted. Too often,
however, a heavy bump reverberated through
the house, and we turned over for another
doze. The swallows were homeward flying.
Our little Australian colony of writers,
singers, artists and playwrights was an alien
in London, fiercely antagonistic to this quaint
and unsympathetic race. We thought so
much of ourselves. I had met George Lam-
bert in France, horribly hard up ; and I stood
with him, on his arrival in London, as he
unpacked his canvases painted in the kindly
light of Paris. I cheered him up all I could.
Later I migrated to Chelsea to be near my
friend. It did not matter much to me, for
I. had no wife and child to support. I had
a room, beguiled to its dirt by the fact that
it was once the habitation of Charles Lamb.
Yes, the landlady timorously admitted that
she had a bath. She even cleaned out the
refuse of long years that had filled that bath,
and took a pride in bringing me a little can
of hot water. Those were the days when I
carefully computed the length of the ’bus
sections on my journeys into the city; I used
to cut out and walk the short sections and
ride on the long ones. Yet London got us
down. So hopeless it seemed to impress
these stolid Englanders that Lambert and
I felt unable to venture into the ogre’s den
unless together. London’s million windows
stared down, grim and forbidding, as we ven-
tured forth. In Fleet-street we used to part,
Lambert trying his drawings—now worth
much money—on the editors of illustrated
magazines; I proffering my short stories to
the weeklies; and we w T ould meet an hour
later. If either of us had had an acceptance
we would risk our future on a 9d. afternoon
tea; if the result was a blank we could get
tea for 3d. at the A.B.C. The trouble was
that Lambert was an artist and I insisted
that I was a poet, though George always
had his doubts.
On my arrival in London I besieged Car-
melite House, but for a week I never got
further than a supernumerary office-boy.
Then, as Richard Seddon was due in London
for the postponed Coronation of Edward
VII., I wrote on my card, “Know all about
Dick Seddon,” and was immediately ushered
into the presence. It was Northcliffe’s
brother. He immediately commissioned me
to follow Seddon up, pumped me about Aus-
tralasian politics, gave me afternoon tea,
and told me that he had a magazine, the
Liberal Review, that I could write for,
and advised me not to write anything about
Maoriland, but what I thought of the shops
of London. I got several of those columns
in the Daily Mail; and then the intoler-
able suspicion overcame me that I was be-
coming a journalist! I had not taken the
trouble to come all that way, at consider-
able expense and inconvenience, to be a mere
journalist. I deserved better than that from
London. I was a poet —and journalism could
go hang! True, I compromised with several
articles in the Nineteenth Century, at
which now I should be amazed at my cheek.
But they paid £2O an article. A serial of
adventure found acceptance in a well-known
boys’ magazine, at 10s. a thousand. Mean-
time I published “The Nazarene,” and used
to make a point of dropping in on the pub-
lisher and cheering him up. It was a great
day for both of us when our sales reached
double figures. I got £lO for that master-
piece. I don’t know what he got. “Tus-
sock Land” was accepted in Unwin’s First
Novel series, and I got something out of
that; and “London Streets” managed to get
itself published and occasionally sold. In-
cidentally, later I sent from Sydney “(Tala-
liad Jones” to a famous London publisher.
I am not quite sure, but I think the amount
I made in royalties on that novel was £5
(is. I still think the book was quite worth
that.
My life in England, however, was not all
> unhappy. I had rich relations in the coun-
* try, and friends who had known my brother
at Oxford. I spent, a whole- winter with
a charming group of Englishers, who, divin-
ing my poverty, swooped down on me and
carried me off to their delightful home, leav-
ing me free to produce works of genius (un-
wanted) all the mornings, but making me
engage in the usual sports and visits in the
afternoons, and never allowing me to spend
even so much as a tip. When I visited my
dear old cousin I had of necessity to extend
my visit to three weeks. If my stay was
under that period I lost on the transaction,
owing to the railway fare and the tips.
With three weeks’ stay I saved a few shil-
lings. I invariably stayed three weeks. I
had relations, too, in the Isle of Man. where
my ill-health culminated in a nervous break-
down, and where I noted that nobody ever
read Hall Caine. On my convalescence these
good people packed me off, on strict medical
advice, on a trip through the Mediterranean
on a tramp steamer, calling at all the ports,
dallying in the Dardanelles and reaching
Odessa.
On my return to England I remember one
day on the moors when I decided that Aus-
tralia would do me. I borrowed £5O. and on
a one-class ship reached Sydney with 10s.
in my pocket, made enough money to take
me back to Maoriland, and was offered the
editorship of the N.. Z. Times on the voyage
across.
Many a time, in our worst depressions, I
used to say to George Lambert, “It seems
nretty rotten now, but what a wonder-
ful adventure, with so much romance and
so much youth, and with so careless a con-
tempt of the world, this experience will be
by-and-bye when we look back on it all!”
And it is.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
A Satchel of Books
The Trap, by Dorothy M. Richardson (Duckworth).
The maunderings of a feminist, wearisome and in-
coherent, cast in the form of a novel.
A Sydney-side Saxon, by Rolf Boldrewood (Angus
and Robertson). A reprint included in the pub-
lishers’ neat and handy “Platypus Series.”
Commercial Do’s and Don’t’s, by David W. Caddick
(Methuen). A concise epitome of what is wise and
what is unwise in commerce. Superficial, but fur-
nishes that scrap-meat of thought which is becoming
more and more the mental food of this generation.
Inspector French’s Greatest Case, by F. Wills
Crofts (Collins). The writer takes high rank among
builders of Scotland Yard edifices. This latest yarn
shows all the constructive skill and ingenious side-
tracking that characterised “The Cask” and other
of his novels.
Portraits in Oil and. Vinegar, by James Laver
(Castle). There is more oil than vinegar in this
very comprehensive survey of the artists of the
various British schools, from Dicksee, P.R.A., to
Paul Nash, anarchist. Well illustrated, mainly with
self-portraits.
How to Heat Your House, by Edwin Gunn
(Country Life. Ltd.). This handy booklet is
written from the point of view of the practical
architect who has to deal with widely different
requirements; it covers many forms of installation
and is well illustrated.
Pearl Island, by H. C. Rowland (Collins). The
title indicates the type. The hero and heroine are
shipwrecked on a desert island —and you know the
rest. The author has apparently a first-hand know-
ledge of oysters and, incidentally, gives an interesting
description of the growth of a pearl.
For the Luncheon ,Interval, by A. A. Milne
(Methuen). The metrical crumbs swept into this
little volume deal with such subjects as cricket,
bridge and golf. F’rinstance—
“The yearly at the full and the morn’s at eleven,
It’s a wonderful day just straight from Heaven,
And this is a hole I can do in seven —-
Caddie, my driver, please.”
Gypsy Royal. Adventuress, by Mary Marlowe
(Collins). As this Sydney writer has had a training
on the stage, she has been able to give a fine air
of reality to the adventures of her heroine, a
brilliant and beautiful actress. The book is written
vivaciously and easily carries the reader’s interest,
while making no special appeal beyond its purpose
of amusement.
The Death of a Millionaire, by G. D. H. and
Margaret Cole (Collins). Something is certainly
likely to happen to a millionaire who fixes up a great
mining concession with the Soviet Government. It
does. He is found dead and the question of who
killed him, of no enthralling interest in itself, is
made so by the mystery and romance in which the
authors ingeniously shroud it.
Professor, How Could You? by H. L. Wilson
(John Lane). The author of “Ruggles of Red Gap”
and half - a dozen or more other books has not
exhausted the reef of humor from which they were
drawn. The adventures of Professor Copplestone,
familiarly known as Old Red Sandstone, will furnish
many a laugh to the reader in the railway-carriage
corner or in the easy chair by the winter fire.
A Guide to the Study of Shakspeare’s Plays, by
Geoffrey H. Crump, M.A. (Harrap). The author, a
schoolmaster, found that by turning his classes into
reading-parties, which partly read and partly acted
the plays, he succeeded in getting a thorough know-
ledge of two and a general knowledge of eight of
them per annum into the heads of every member.
In this excellent little book he applies his method
to all the Bard’s works.
The Monkey Puzzle, by J. D. Beresford (Collins).
Readers look to Mr. Beresford for work that bears
the stamp of thought and originality; and if “The
Monkey Puzzle” does not attain quite the high
standard of some of its predecessors, it is neverthe-
less a novel well out of the ruck. The story centres
in a married woman living in the rigidly conven-
tional atmosphere of English provincial life who
attempts to assert her views about the desirableness
of a greater freedom between the sexes. Her acts
are misinterpreted, innocence translated into vice,
and trouble follows. She learns in the end that it
is not sufficient to have one’s own theory of living
—“you’ve got also to try to understand theirs.”
Population, by A. M. Carr-Saunders (Oxford
Press). Another of the excellent World’s Manual
series. This, mainly an epitome of the author’s
big work on the same subject, is a useful introduc-
tion to the question of what is to be done with the
world’s ever-increasing supply of baby. Saturation
point will be reached when 5,200,000,000 pairs of feet
are planted on the sphere; and this result, at present
rates of increase, will be achieved about a.ii. 2025.
After that, unless the League of Nations does some-
thing definite, the nation with the most baby of
the choicest quality will wield the biggest stick.
Australia’s quota at that time will be 40,000,000,
but only if she has built herself the roads, rail-
ways, industries and new ports to accommodate the
party; whether she will be able to wield a stick
commensurate with her bulk will also depend upon
the quality of the baby. Just as the Germans
trampled on the Bolsheviks in 1917 and the Japanese
on the Chinese in 1895, so an Australian nation ol'
40,000,000 morons or communists could be trampled
on by a handful of healthy Dyalcs.
Christian Directory (Geo. Bell). A selection by
Jeanette Tawney of chapters from Richard Baxter’s
work published in 1673. Baxter’s “Saint’s Rest” is
the most familiar of this theologian’s work, but the
present selection is made with a view to showing
the doctrines with regard to economic ethics which
commended themselves to the Puritan divine. The
book is interesting to the general reader because it
gives an outline of the views of the Christian church
in the middle of the seventeenth century with regard
to the relations of employer and employed. The
servant is directed to take his condition as chosen
for him by God, and is told to “expect from God
your chief reward” —a proposition that would scarcely
meet modern trade-union demands. Other spiritual
directions equally out of harmony with the concepts
of to-day are: “Grudge not at the meanness of the
provisions of the family. If you have your daily
bread, that is your necessary wholesome food, your
murmuring for more delicious fare is but your
shame, and sheweth that your hearts are sunk into
vour bellies, and that you are fleshly-minded persons.”
The masters also have their duties, among them
being that of keeping their servants from frequenting
alehouses, and going before them “as examples of
holiness and wisdom” —and other matters that do
not come within the jurisdiction of industrial courts
in the twentieth century. On the whole, Baxter s
days appear to have been singularly devoid of cakes
and ale for the “lower orders.”
*
“Ex-Dig.”: One of my most surprising discoveries
during the war was that the hero of adventurous
fiction—the man who plunges into all sorts of
dangers and escapes the lot —-was not the unreality
I had been wont to regard him. Multitudes of the
bravest were killed; but the percentage of
casualties was possibly higher amongst those who
wavered or tried to dodge danger. In hopovers there
was generally a reluctance to be in the first wave :
yet the conviction was gradually forced on me that
the first wave, advancing rapidly before the hell s
music of the opposition started playing, was the
safest. And in many ways the man who put irresolu-
tion from his mind and kept it clear was able to
see chances that saved his own life when otheis,
confused and irresolute, got their issue. In many
a hand-to-hand fight the man with the least reso-
lution was beaten before he was reached ; and mostly
his hands went up. Fate seemed often to take a
hand, too, against the shirker; an extreme case
was the bombing of a concentration camp containing
all the leadswingers who had managed by military
offences or malingering to dodge going into the line.
Ever since these convictions forced themselves upon
me I have been able to give the super-heroic escapades
of Rupert Braveheart much more serious consideration
than formerly, being satisfied that it was possible
for him to have lived to see the happy wedding on
page 327 instead of dying like the cowardly Douglas
Darkling on page 105.
“Lond”: I got jumped on last year for saying that
England has no use for the Australian artist, whethei
painter or author, unless he is distinctively
“colonial.” But it is true, all the same. “If the
fellow must butt in,” seems to be the attitude, let
him stick to his gums and emus and wallabies, do
that we can know how to place him.” Here is
London Referee (5/4/’25) on the new London show
by resident Australian artists: —
For so small a people, Australians are exceed
ingly rich in the creative impulse.... But when-
ever an Australian seeks aesthetic expression, he does
so in a tired European idiom. . . . The majority 01
the pictures are just stale subjects treated in a
stale manner Let them give us Europe and
Europeans through Australian vision, not through
spectacles tinted with all the European aesthetic
horror of 30 years ago. ... It seems to me amazing
that such clever people as Australian artists gener-
ally are can travel so far from home to repeat
esthetic platitudes, when they have an unexploited
almost unexploitable—continent at their back doors.
Imagine throwing away a heritage of sunlight and
mountains and bush for a mess of European mists!
It is barely credible.
“Zanthus”: Much of the discussion about the
possibility of Australia having been known to the
ancients is based on quite wrong premises. We
tend, influenced by books and traditions, to take
the English point of view, and to look on the
British Isles as the centre of the world. As the
antipodes of Britain, Australia then comes to be
considered as a world’s-end kind of place. Yet, as
Mackinder has pointed out in his “Britain,” the
British Isles were almost at the world’s end until
after the great discoveries of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. In earlier times Australia was
almost as close to the centre. If we go back
far enough it was nearer. In the centuries immedi
ately before and after the beginnings of the Christian
era, Ceylon, nine days by steamer from Fremantle
nowadays, was the seat of a wonderful civilisation,
the stupendous ruins of which now lie buried in the
jungles in the north of the island. It was no mere
local civilisation, but one of which the trade rami
fications extended far and wide. One proof of this
is found in the hoards of coins of the Roman
Emperors, from Augustus onwards, which have been
unearthed in Ceylon and in Southern India. Chinese
coins, too, have turned up in considerable numbers
in the lost cities of Ceylon. Much nearer still to
Australia was the great Hindu civilisation which
arose a little later in Java, 1000 miles or so from
our north-western coast. For long centuries the
Indian Ocean and the seas of the Malay Archi
pelago were furrowed far and wide by navigation, it
would be strange indeed if some sort of knowledge
of Australia had not been acquired by accident, if not
by design, during those ages.
The Lady of the Cavern, by Hilda Bridge (N.S.W.
Bookstall Co.). Hugh Wharton, a youthful English-
man of the type oniy met in adventure stories, does
the 12,000-mile trip to Australia in order to locate
m uncle who has been robbed of his shave in an
estate. The uncle turns out to be a notorious cattle
thief, and the young man after an orgy of sen-
sational encounters is glad to escape to bis home-
land with a good-looking female as a souvenir of
his exciting journey. Not bad reading, but hardly
the sort of book to present to an intending immigrant.
The Ship Beautiful, by Charles Allen (Frederick
Warne). The author, who is the son of the High
Commissioner for Maoriland, is blind, and the story
is transcribed from his Braille script. He has
produced a book, his first, which makes a direct
appeal to lovers of literature. It is written in
good, clean English with an ear attuned to the
music of words and an eye—an inward eye—-that
visions the beauty and goodness of life. The book
is unusual in construction, with two sharply con-
trasted yet interwoven stories, the one a fairy tale
fantastic and full of color, the other a setting of
grev-tinted sympathetic humanity. It is a charming
book.


Frictional resistance to the re-
bound of the car is secured by
the action of the two friction
discs placed on both sides of the
steel drum which contains the
coiled spring.
This eliminates frictional wear
on the strap, and provides
perfectly-balanced resistance to
the rebound.
The Stewart Strap is subjected
to no more friction than is a
string when being wound on to
a pencil.

THE Lister Lighting Plant that has given satisfaction for
many years in the grand old stately homes of England can
be relied upon to give that same satisfaction, convenience,
comfort and safety in our own Australian homestead.
The “Lister-Lite” System is Electric and easy to handle,
and works without any mechanical trouble arising.
The satisfactory service of an Electric Lighting Plant
depends chiefly on the Engine. No amount of storage battery
will make up for a weakness in this essential part.
A Lighting Plant is a Machine for converting the
Mechanical power of the Engine into Electrical Power that
lights your lamps, and if there is not a steady, reliable flow
of power from the engine the light is uncertain at its very source.
Lister Engines have earned the title of "The Rolls-Royce
of Farth Engines.” No words can express more clearly what
this means in reliability and smooth running and the unnum-
bered years of service given by them.
The same dependability is built into every part of the
“Lister-Lite” Plant. It is BRITISH BUILT throughout.
There is a type to suit every country Home, Institution,
Church or Business Premises.
The Agents for "Lister-Lite” have an aggregate of 335
years service in Australia behind them. This experience is
given for the asking. Send to them for full particulars,

Resting in the ev’ning, waking with the
morn,
Engine-bells and -whistles on the air are
borne.
Just beneath my window, by the harbor
shore,
The old familiar jackass laughs his wild
furore.
All this song and revel, light and shadow
play, . .
Orchestrates a setting for the coming day.
Twinkling in the distance, shore and ferry
lights,
Punctuate the grandeur of the southern
nights.
'Cross the morning distance there the night
begins,
Fighting day reluctant. But, 10, the day-
light wins!
Just beneath my window, by the harbor bay,
Gorgeous morning bird-songs wake you to
their lay. .
If you care to listen you will be m thrall
To the nesting wild birds’ plaintive mating
call.

Convalescent.
The damnable confinement of this room
Walls all my spirit up. I yearn to see
The sun and sky, the hills, the tall great tree
New dressed for Spring, and all the world
in bloom,
The silver lines of snails along the grass,
The smoke upcoiling in the limpid air
From shining chimneys, and the engines pass
With roar of steam and steel and cheerful
blare;
I yearn to bound at morning from my bed,
And race along the path and down the lawn
And plunge into the sweeping surf, just red
From sky to sky with the uprising dawn,
And race and swim and feel my straining
legs,
And homeward fly in lust for ham and eggs

“With God.”
They said: “He is with God!”
I "could not see him so—
His soil-stained feet with glory shod,
Content from earth to go.
I could not see him so !
I only saw him lie
Beneath the tussocks all a-blow,
His face unto the sky;
And all the earth's rich brown
Between his quiet feet;
And tender grass-shoots thrusting down
To make his winding sheet.
They said : “He is with God!”
But still I knew he heard
The stirring of each crumpled clod,
The calling of a bird.
I knew that still there came
To him the muted song
Of murmuring seas, and, like a flame,
Earth-scents, enduring, long.
Unvisited, alone
Within his age-old bed,
Back, back from whence his life had grown,
Not quite uncomforted !
One with the soil he knew,
Part of the fecund sod!
And what they said was passing true
If the sweet earth be God!

Three Women.
A world-and-a-half from each to each,
Three women I met on the quaint old
earth ;
And one was sweet as a sun-kissed peach
And innocent as a poppy’s birth.
One was dry as a ring-barked tree,
Wrinkled and yellow and harsh and cold;
And one was pleading a paltry fee,
With nothing to sell but had oft been sold.
Innocence, prude and a tattered sot
A world-and-a-half, did I say, apart?
But each was reading—l’d quite forgot—
And the name of the book was “A Lover s
Heart.”

The Bell.
A monk who reads his breviary in the sun ;
\ peacock screaming on a sanded path ;
A woman’s fine, thin body, looking through
A muslin robe, her small face at the hedge:
The pacing of the monk: his black, met
brows,
His brown, lean face, his strong, repelling
hands
Holding the book as some men hold a girl.
There is a breath of heady marjoram,
The homely smell of apples in the sun,
The burring of the bees in yielding flowers.
The light strikes on the woman’s yellow hair,
Picks out the pink flesh underneath her
gown ;
Slides to the sandalled feet, the rosy heels.
The diamond buckle at her pearly knee.
A tear falls hissing on the burning ground:
A butterfly swoops to the prickly hedge.
The monk, unmoved, still cons his breviary,
With swinging beads and worn bronze
crucifix.
He turns a page, but does not lift his eyes.
From far away there comes a tolling bell.

A LONG, THIN DOCUMENT.
It is the usual thing in daily-paperdom to
summarise the new Parliamentary pro-
gramme or the Treasurer’s annual heap of
figures in a column of “Points.” When the
Bbuce-Page Government opened its Federal
session on June 11 the time-honored habit
was largely departed from because there
wasn’t a point. A lot of things are to be
done about a lot of things, but what is defi-
nitely to be done about any one thing is a
mystery. It is a pity, for there is much to
be seen to, and a very bashed reputation to
be straightened out, before the party can go
to the poll with much prospect of success,
and time is not too plentiful.
* * * *
. The speech conveys an idea that the Min-
istry is in its chronic state of mild obfusca-
tion concerning the long-missing transconti-
nental railway. A little bit of the much-
overdue obligation is to be met, but not im-
mediately, by building either some 3ft. 6in.
line northward from Oodnadatta or some 4ft.
81jn. line northward from Tarcoola, and the
thing is to stop at Alice Springs. It will
stick up on the _ map like a stalagmite, the
stalactite formation being supplied by a pos-
sible, but not certain, extension of the exist-
ing northern (3ft. 6in.) fragment from its
present dead-end on the Katherine to one
equally defunct at Daly Waters. Despite
this lamentable uncertainty of mind the same
paragraph contains an allusion to the Gov-
ernment’s devotion to the cause of a uniform
railway gauge, as evidenced by its action in
subsidising two rich States in the matter of
the Grafton-Kyogle-Brisbaue railway, thus
providing a duplicate connection between two
State capitals while its own great Northern
harbor lias no connection at all. The Com-
bine’s habit of enthusing over every job save
its own, presumably due to the lack of imme-
diate votes along the line of its own job,
here stands out once more. In contrast to
this slackness about the railway which is
part of a very definite agreement is the deci-
sion to appoint three Commissioners as an
additional burden on an already over-
offieialled patch of isolation. The latest fad
is that, if Westralia and Queensland con-
tribute each a strip of land to enlarge a
Possession which is already too large for the
size of the men who rule it, they, the two
worst samples of misgovernment in the Com-
monwealth, will be taken into partnership
for the purpose of running the show. An
uncontradicted report has it that South Aus-
tralia, which contributed the whole Terri-
tory in the first place, will not be invited
to take a hand, lest its allusions to the un-
fulfilled treaty may disturb the harmony.
* * * *
The news that the disastrous marine
speculation is to be continued, on a much
larger and probably more unprofitable scale,
was. supplied by the Prime Minister in a pre-
session speech. The lack of further allusion
or information may have been an effort to
keep a painful subject out of the debate.
On the other hand a bleak sensation of doubt
may have arisen when it was dis-
covered that deregistration only made
the fireman-king of Australia more con-
temptuous of Bruce and any possible
BRUCE-made law. Recent happenings in
the matter of the Dongarra’s crew and
other events led one bitter old politician to
allude to the show as a Floating Academy
of Crime and a training-ground for Com-
munists and mixed revolutionaries, which
may not have been wholly accurate but was
certainly eloquent. The Bruce-Page pro-
gramme speaks mildly about legislation for
“securing the observance of the awards of
the Court,” but how a Government with
hardly any visible army and no police save
what it may contrive to borrow from a
semi-Communist State Government can
“secure” anything in a forcible way unless
it arms itself better it is difficult to tell.
When it obtained a conviction against some
of its deserting seamen it couldn’t even keep
them in gaol because the least populous of
the mainland States wouldn’t let it, and if
it finds itself besieged in Canberra one of
these, days it. may feel almost as if it was in
gaol itself. ’Berra is a difficult place to get
away from without State permission. The
tariff is to be amended by the doing of some-
thing to “anomalies and defects,” and that
gentle way of putting the case hardly sounds
like the vigorous action which Australia’s
failing industries demand. The agreement
which has propped up the Queensland sugar
industry in one way and another since 1915,
until it has outgrown the local market and
is in trouble about its surplus, is to be re-
newed, presumably as a permanency this
time, but details are not supplied yet, which
is a way details have. Voices are already
heard from Theodore’s State asking for a
very solid Federal bonus on cotton, so the
Prime Minister is likely to have something
more to think of at an early date. And, in
some way which will develop later, more
restriction is to be provided for undesirable
aliens, though the restrictions we have are
less used than they might be. One method
which has been recommended is that every
alien should be registered and be required
to keep the authorities posted up as regards
his address, that he should dwell here by
virtue of a passport renewable annually,
and that its non-renewal should be a hint
that his ship is on the tide and will soon be
bounding over the ocean wave. After years
of spotless integrity a long-distance passport
might be granted, but that is a problem of
the future.
* # * *
The giving of consideration forms much
of the balance of the Federal programme.
The ports and harbors of the Commonwealth
are to be considered when Sir George
Buchanan’s report comes in. Also the
Navigation Act when a royal commission’s
report comes in, and national insurance
when a similar document arrives, and
national health upon the materialisation and
assimilation of still another tome of the
same description. The matter of granting
a Federal subsidy to the unfederal Govern-
ment of Westralia, and the reconstruction
of the Institute of Science and Industry,
and some points concerning the Canberra
metropolis only await reports, which are
hourly or monthly expected. Some plain,
useful-looking items deal with an improved
output of munitions, which sounds good pro-
vided the munitions don’t get into the wrong
hands; the making of Australian power-
alcohol, which is better than importing
petrol; patents, and, after 24 years’ need-
less delay, a measure “dealing with life in-
surance companies.” Of the last mild hopes
are entertained. The country wants com-
prehensive and uniform statutes dealing with
all sorts of insurance concerns and with
banks, and taking the entire business out of
the hands of State Legislatures for good.
In the absence of a royal commission’s re-
port, which would probably do little good if
it was present, nothing much of the sort is
expected.
* * * *
The Bruce-Page bill of lading for the last
session of this Parliament is a long one. It
is orderly, grammatical and absolutely free
from violent or profane language and from
slang. There is nothing alcoholic about it.
But the authors apparently have no idea
that the structure of the Commonwealth
shows signs of cracking in many directions,
and that the making of law loses some of its
importance if the finished article is permitted
to be a dud.
THE FRANK AUSTRALIAN MANU-
FACTURER AND THE OYSTER-
LIKE IMPORTER.
The importing interest cut a poor figure
in Melbourne last week when representatives
of two overseas machinery concerns, one
U.S. and the other Canadian, appeared be-
fore the Tariff Board to support an appli-
cation for “the removal or reduction” of the
duties on agricultural implements. They
proved very unsatisfactory witnesses. The
spokesman for the Canadian co. trotted out
the old yarn about “the natural Protection
which distance gives” being sufficient for the
Australian manufacturer, neglecting, as
usual, to explain why Canadian and U.S.
manufacturers, who enjoy the same quan-
tity of “natural Protection” against Austra-
lian manufacturers, demand (and get) High
Protection at their own Customs; and
gloomily declared that Australian imports
of tillage implements were lower in 1922-
23-24 than in 1915-16-17. Asked why his
company did not manufacture in Australia
if the conditions were so favorable to the
local implement-maker, the witness replied,
looking worried, that the matter had been
discussed time and again, that it was for
Ihe directors to determine, that it might be
difficult to raise the money, and that he
would be able to give a more definite answer
in five or six months. The other gentle-
man said that his U.S. principals had de-
cided years ago against manufacturing in
Australia because, in effect, many varieties
of implements would be required, and the
demand would be relatively small.
* * * *
In his reference to “the natural Protec-
tion which distance gives,” the Canadian
co.’s mouthpiece volunteered the wild asser-
tion (unless the friendly Argus misreported
him) that it “averaged more than 35 per
cent, on the invoice value of imported
machines.” But pertinent information con-
cerning those same machines could not be
extracted from him. He declined to tell the
Board in confidence the f.o.b. and c.i.f. prices
of the lines in which he is interested, or the
average rate of profit on his implements in
general and on cream-separators in parti-
cular, or the extent of his company’s turn-
over in Australia, or the rate and amount
of income-tax paid. And he persisted in
his refusal, as also did the representative
of the U.S. factories, even when the Board
pointed out that it had been expressly com-
missioned to inquire whether or not exces-
sive profits were being made in the imple-
ment trade, and that “this very necessary
information has been willingly conceded by
all local manufacturers.” So the investi-
gation was broken off to enable the Board
to consult the Grown Solicitor. It is
improbable that any more agents for foreign
farm-machinery will present themselves for
examination. Neither is it likely that the
duties will be lowered or removed, as
is impudently proposed, in the interest
of oyster-like overseas concerns which
enjoy High Protection in their own coun-
tries. Rather should Parliament increase
the measure of tariff assistance given, which
is very small in some instances, considering
(1) that the materials used in the manufac-
ture of implements are very much dearer in
Australia than in Canada or the U.S.; (2)
that inter-State freight charges are so much
higher, mile for mile, than ocean rates that
the so-called “natural Protection” has almost
been wiped out; and (3) that implements
valued at nearly three-quarters of a million
were needlessly imported last year. Were
the Australian tariff as Protective as those
of Canada and the G'.S.A., every implement
and every spare part required on an Aus-
tralian farm, orchard or market-garden would
be made in the Commonwealth.
* * * *
The manufacture of agricultural imple-
ments is a bright spot in the history of Aus-
tralian industrial enterprise. Its value has
been recognised in generous words by the
writer of a bulletin issued by the U.S. De-
partment of Commerce: —
The enormous increase in wheatgrowing in Aus-
tralia would hardly have been possible had not
suitable machinery been evolved capable of satis-
factorily handling the matured crops under the
climatic and labor conditions prevailing in that
country. The entire credit for the development and
perfection of the stripper and, later on, of the
stripper-harvester is due to the Australians them-
selves, as both of these machines were invented and
first perfected and built in that country. When it
is considered that these machines as built at present
are but little different from the first ones built, and
that under ordinary conditions they work in a
most excellent manner, it must be admitted that
Australian agricultural engineers are second to none
when given an equal opportunity.
Besides the implements mentioned, the
stump-jump mouldboard plough was in-
vented and developed in Australia. So
were the one-way disc cultivator, the
header harvester (which has saved count-
less thousands of acres of wheat laid flat on
the ground by storms), the auto-header har-
vester, the pea-header and the tyne-drill.
After the war, when the Australian farmer
was being charged as much as £l3O for an
imported 6ft. reaper and binder, the H. Y.
McKay Proprietary set to work and manu-
factured 6ft. reapers and binders, having
been promised adequate Protection, with the
result that the then Minister of Customs
made the subjoined comparison of prices in
the House of Reps, on June 15, 1924: —
Before the duty on reapers and binders came
into operation, the importing firms had raised their
price to £9B in Australia. In Maoriland and Britain,
where no duty is imposed, the price is £97 and £92
10s. respectively. The Australian manufacturer is
now supplying these implements at his works for
£95. It is quite evident, therefore, that the
duty is not being passed on to the farmer.
When H. V. McKay gave evidence before
the Tariff Board, to which he disclosed the
profit on each of his firm’s implements, he
declared that the cash price at the works of
Australian-made reapers and binders had
been reduced by successive cuts to £6B,
whereas an imported machine of the same
size was quoted at £BO in Australia and
£B3 16s. in Argentina, where there is no
duty or local manufacture.
THE LITTLE TIN HOUSE IN THE
NORTH.
The distinguished engineer Sir George
Buchanan, having, under engagement to the
Commonwealth Government, looked into the
harbor question in Australia’s north-west,
devoted himself to a hurried investigation
of the inhabitants of Tropical Australia. He
discovered the tin-house at once. Lots of
people, for years past have been discovering
that tin-house, with its terrible tin-kitchen,
and have been saying how such things must
inevitably render Mrs. Northerner sterile
and Mr. N. a lunatic and all the little N.’s
either dead or imbecile; but the obstinate
Nortlierner goes on living and having larger
and healthier families than folk have in the
South. It is time the anomaly was inquired
into.
Sir George is a tropical authority, lie
says so himself, and proves it by citing the
fact that lie has lived in many tropical places,
such as India and Burma and Japan—which
last is just as tropical as California, where
the movies come from. All other authori-
ties on the subject of the white man in the
Tropics lay it down as an axiom that liis
health and welfare will depend entirely on
the extent to which he is exposed to risk of
infection from the colored population living
alongside him. Now, Tropical Australia has
no colored population worth mentioning; it
is the only tropical country in the world
which is inhabited solely by white races.
This fact alone would seem to make Sir
George’s opinion pretty valueless so far
as it is based on his previous tropical experi-
ence. However, in addition to the frequently
discovered tin-houses, he discovered that the
inhabitants of Tropical Australia are in a
constant state of “nervous tension,” which
makes it impossible for them to settle the
country or get sufficient labor for the sugar in-
dustry. But as statisticians have been tellingus
that the population of the North is growing
faster than that of any other part of Aus-
tralia, and as the sugar industry last year man-
aged to produce a surplus which is giving a
lot of trouble to dispose of, it is difficult
to see exactly what Sir George is driving at.
One of his most fearsome findings was that
of a doctor who told him that the sole sub-
ject of conversation between wife and hus-
band in the North turns on requests
by the woman to be permitted to go south
for rest and change. And he quotes other
medical men as being in entire accord with
his views that “women rapidly deterioate,
physically and mentally, and that the white
race in the coastal areas under existing con-
ditions is only kept up by the influx of new
blood from the South, otherwise it would in
a few generations become enfeebled and die
out.” One doctor whom he did not quote
was Dr. Humphry, who, after 30 years in
Townsville, told the Australasian Medical
Congress bluntly that anyone who said that
the white race could not thrive in the Aus-
tralian tropics was “talking rot.”
Australians are pretty tired by now of
these gruesome discoveries, but it may be
worth while to run once more over some of
the known facts, as opposed to Sir George’s
hearsay and fancies. From the labor point
of view we have the testimony of a writer
in Health who, after 20 years’ experience
in handling all sorts of sugar-field labor in
North Queensland, expressed his opinion that
“the British gangs head the list against all-
comers.” He explains that by British he
meant all British nationalities, including
Australians. Hast year the Australian In-
stitute of Tropical Medicine at Townsville
carried out an investigation into 740 North
Queensland households, in seven areas
selected in order to give as much diversity
as_ possible in respect of climatic and indus-
trial conditions. This showed that the majo-
rity of the house-mothers in the North had
been born there, that their general health,
despite the tin-kitchen, was at least as good
as that of working-class mothers anywhere
else in Australia, and that the tropic-born
children are taller and heavier than, and at
least as mentally intelligent as, children born
elsewhere in Australia. It also showed that
the tropic-born wives have, on an average,
more children than the imported wives. The
ruthless hand of science thus strangles Sir
George’s outcry about keeping up the North
only by the influx of fresh blood from the
South.
The Institute has also collected a large
series of histories of northern families, cov-
ering three and even four generations. There
has been no time for more. These show very
clearly that there is no trace of degeneration,
physical or mental, amongst the tropically-
descended children. In 1920 the Chief
Actuary of the Australian Mutual Provident
Society read a paper before the Australasian
Medical Congress giving the results of a
detailed examination of nearly 5000 poli-
cies issued from the Townsville and Cairns
offices of the society. He concluded by say-
ing that the rates of mortality so deduced
were surprisingly low, and that there was
no need for life insurance offices to treat
North Queensland proponents any differently
from those who live elsewhere in Australia.
As the A.M.P. has better data on the subject
than any other body in the world, it can be
safely assumed that none of the dreadful
things discovered by Sir George shorten the
Northerner’s life. The results of medical
examinations for military service, both for
the Citizen Forces and the A.1.F., afford a
lot more evidence to the same effect.
The percentage of cadets rejected in
Tropical Queensland has several times been
lower on the annual figures than in Tas-
mania, Victoria, New South Wales or South
Australia. For the A.I.F. more volunteers
were rejected in Southern Queensland than
in Tropical Queensland. And medical officers
who served in the Great War have testified
to the toughness and endurance of the North-
erner under the hardest and most trying con-
ditions of trench life in France.
But there is really no need to multiply
evidence for the further annoyance of Sir
George and those who talk like him. In
reality there is no longer any Ti-opical Aus-
tralia problem. It has been solved by
some 200,000 white Australians who live and
thrive there, and breed larger families of
stronger children than people do in other
parts of Australia, and who are making the
North the most prosperous and progressive
area in Australia. The worst trouble which
it has to endure is not the tin-house or the
climate or even the neglect of Governments:
it is the misinformation which is circulated
about it.

A Black Day on the Queensland
Railways.
At Rockhampton on May 20, Sir George
Buchanan, the British engineer, informed a
reporter that he was carrying away from
Queensland, along with favorable impres-
sions of the country, a very bad impression
of the Government railways. On the jour-


ney from Cairns to Townsville, he said, the
locomotive broke down completely, and we
were bushed for five hours.” Boarding an-
other train —the southern mail —at Towns-
ville, he was delayed for another five hours
by another infirm engine about nine miles
from Rockhampton. “There is something
radically wrong with the railways,” the
exasperated gentleman went on, “when for
two days in succession, with different loco-
motives, the whole service is upset. In all
my travels I never before had such an ex-
perience. Either the locomotive branch
doesn’t know 7 its job or the Government
doesn’t allow it sufficient money to keep its
locomotives in good order.” It is against
the rules for the guest of a Government to
attack its administration in a newspaper,
but the reply of Larcombe, the Minister of
Railways, instead of stressing this point,
stating the facts temperately, and express-
ing willingness to remove the causes of com-
plaints made in the proper manner, showed
equally bad taste and worse temper, lie
began by suggesting that the critic knew
nothing of railways on the practical side
(in sober fact, tin l critic was helping to run
a railway system when Larcombe was in
baby clothes), and proceeded as follows :
It is not the first time Queensland has heard
from these globetrotting defamers... .testy trav-
ellers who expect a railway service as smooth and
convenient as that of a first-class h0te1.... Sir
George ought to ask the people of North Queen-,
land what they think of the Brisbane-Cairns railway
service. He should recollect that in the country
he comes from, not only are there late trains, hut
thousands of people are maimed and killed annually
on the railways. In Queensland we have been singu-
larly free from serious smashes.... Perhaps Sir
George is doing a little propaganda. Perhaps it
makes him spit blood to have to ride in a train in a
Labor-controlled State—a previous globetrotter used
this remark.
Not three .weeks after this stupid utterance
the most tragic railway accident in the his-
tory of Queensland occurred near Gympie.
In the darkness of early morning the luggage-
van and a coach of the Brisbane-Rockhamp-
ton mail train left the rails, and in the
resultant smash 10 passengers were killed
and 54 injured. When the news reached
Brisbane, T. Moroney, secretary of the
Queensland branch of the Australian Rail-
ways Union, made a statement to the effect
that he had drawn attention in an interview
to “the likelihood of such an accident occur-
ring unless certain action was taken in direc-
tions which the union had been advocating
for some time.” Moreover :
Only tile previous day he had written a length?
letter to the Commissioner on the state of the
permanent way, particularly mentioning the North
Coast line, in which he suggested that inaction
was being justified only on the ground that no big
smash had occurred iu the State and urged that the
likelihood of such an occurrence should be averted.
Invited to comment on these assertions, the
Commissioner limited himself to the state-
ment that he had carefully examined the
road in the locality of the derailment and
found it in good order. The accident is being
investigated by a departmental board, and
by a tribunal consisting of a Supreme Court
Judge, an engineer and a union secretary,
but something more is required. The public
has paid dearly for political control of the
Queensland railways (in 10 years the deficit
has amounted to £11,475,000, or £3140 a
day) and is entitled to have the feeling
(which, in the circumstances, can only bo
implanted in its mind by some competent and
independent authority) that nothing has been
or is being left undone to make railway
travelling safe.
Eve in Politics.
P. Airey (an ex-Treasurer of Queensland)
writes; —
Humanity survives largely by virtue of Woman’s
alternate selflessness and selfishness. Civilisation
progresses mainly through Man’s emancipation from
feminine fetters. James Watt’s aunt could see
nothing in Jamie’s watching the steam lift the kettle
lid but a wicked waste of time. Arkwright’s wife
destroyed his machines on several occasions and
lived to be presented at Court as Lady Arkwright.
John Wesley’s wife was a termagant of the blackest
dye who used to assault her suffering saint and lay
him prostrate on the floor. Domestic peace being
unattainable, Wesley sought happiness abroad in
action, and became undoubtedly the mightiest
spiritual force in his generation in both England
and America. Another undoubted effect of Woman’s
subtle influence! Had Mrs. Wesley been a gentle,
dove-like sort of person, John might have remained
happy at home. And Mahomet —did he not find it neces-
sary to print a special warning in the Koran, telling
believers that on no account were they to credit a
much-bruited scandal regarding the conduct of his
beloved Ayesha on a certain occasion? One can
see Ayesha through the mist of years inspiring
the Prophet as he penned this admonition. As
Mahomet married more wives he made more con-
quests. He simply had to get out of the house (or
tent) ; distraction was a necessity, and Islam spread
like wildfire.
It is not depreciating woman by any means to
say that she is out of place in politics. The facts
that make her invaluable in the home —the con-
centration on little things, the narrowness, the
intense devotion to the tiny domestic circle —are
the very things that unfit her for the public arena.
If by any chance she arrives there, she betrays her
essential littleness in a hundred ways. When
America declared war on the Kaiser, the only lady
representative in Congress refused to vote, and burst
into tears. When Mrs. Philip Snowden said some-
thing unkind the other day about Ramsay Mac-
donald’s conduct as a leader, Miss Margaret Bond-
fiei.d, M.P., remarked pithily in public: “Ethel
Snowden ought to be slapped.” Note: not Mrs.
Snowden, but “Ethel” ; not “expelled” or “cen-
sured” or “reprimanded,” but “slapped.” How the
sweet aroma of domesticity persists even in the
halls of Westminster and comes fresh and exhilarat-
ing overseas in the cable 1
It was indeed quaint to read a while ago that
Woman will “make a more stable public influence
than Man.” “Varium et mutabile semper femina”
wrote the Latin poet centuries ago, and what reason
has Mankind seen since to dissent from the dictum ?
Any stability in politics she may possess conies from
the fact that in 99 cases out of 100 her vote is
just a duplication of her father’s, her lover’s or her
husband’s, and will land her politically nowhere
In Queensland, One Adult One Vote has been in
existence 24 years, yet that State has never seen
one female candidate put forward—a fairly con-
clusive piece of evidence that the average woman
feels that political life is not her sphere and that
she is much happier and infinitely more useful
outside the hurly-burly. This does not imply by
any means that the average man distinguishes him-
self by much wisdom in his political activities.
But he has this advantage—he is not eternally
swayed by emotionalism anil cheap sentiment, tc
the swamping of his reasoning faculties. It is
really doubtful if the enfranchised women of Aus-
tralia take any deep interest in any public question
at all outside Prohibition. With Prohibition they
are in truth deeply concerned, because the question
of Bill’s beer is a grave domestic problem, and 1
doubt very much whether even Miss Preston Stan-
ley, rare as her platform qualities are, would have
won the first seat for women in the N. S. Wales
Parliament had it not been for her persistent advo-
cacy of Prohibition. Could a poll of the women
of Australia be taken to-morrow, there is little doubt
that Prohibition would soon become the law of the
land, utterly regardless of its practicability. And
if tobacco were subjected to a similar ordeal I am
inclined to think it would go too; and if it were
proposed that Lais and Phryne should be banished
to Terra del Fuego, cn.- might easily anticipate the
verdict.
“Woman,” we have been told, “would scorn the
eloquence of angels should the celestial doctrines
oppose the interests of the home.” But the trouble
is that woman does not realise that certain great
questions, such as the tariff, divorce, conscription
in war time, touch vitally the interests of the home
and may wreck it without any disturbing pick or
crowbar being in evidence. In certain Australian
States there are phases of the law relating to
married women’s property and to divorce which
are of vital interest to women; but no, women’s
organisation ever seems to worry about them. It
will be left probably to some male politician to
deal with these matters, and apprise woman of the
injustices she does not worry about, simply because
she knows nothing at all about them. No man
can doubt that she has a part to play in the
regeneration oi society. But she will not play it
in the political arena. The true sphere is closer,
more intimate, and to the normally constituted
woman infinitely more congenial. And it is well for
us all that it is so.

Head-counting in Japan.
The new Manhood Suffrage Bill in Japan
Las increased the number of voters from
3 to 14 millions —nearly a fourth of the
total population of the archipelago but the
measure has satisfied nobody. Those who
see in the Western method of government
by counting heads a dangerous attack on the
Oriental institution of bushido lament the
innovation, while the democrats rage because
the Upper House introduced a qualification
disfranchising those dependent on others, an
action which reduced the number of nuts
or skulls to be enumerated by over two mil-
lions. Meanwhile a Japanese problem little
known to the outside world has been made
by these measures to bulk larger. This is
the question of the eta, the outcasts of.
Japanese society, who number over three mil-
lions, and who, although they were theoreti-
cally restored to absolute equality with the
rest of the people over 40 years ago, remain
as unassimilable as the pariahs of India or
the negroes of U.S-A. Even the lowest class
of Japanese refuses to have intercourse or
do business with them, and their very touch
is regarded as pollution. There are enter-
prising eta who have risen to positions of
authority and affluence, but the bulk of the
three millions live apart in insanitary vil-
lages which, miserable as they are, are yet
not a great deal worse than the industrial
slums inhabited by the people who despise
them. Lately the new yeast of class-
consciousness and self-determination popu-
larised by Woodrow Wilson has begun to
work in their humble bosoms, and they have
formed an organisation, known as the
Suiheisha, to fight for their rights. San-
guinary clashes with Japanese villagers and
with the police are of almost daily occur-
rence ; but the authorities draw the veil of
a strict censorship over the business for
fear that race riots will break out all over
the country. Having obtained the right to
vote, the eta are determined to use it by
sending their own representatives to Parlia-
ment ; and after the next election, which,
owing to the groggy state of the political
parties, is likely to be soon, the appalling spec-
tacle of sudra statesmen dictating his business
to the descendant of the Sun Goddess may
yet be seen. Another menace to the bureau-
cratic form of government which masquer-
ades as democracy in Japan is the enfran-
chisement of the proletariat, which includes
not only the poorest: worker but also the
skilled worker, the clerk and the intellectual,
who find a common bond of sympathy in
being probably the lowest-paid aggregation
of humanity in the world. These are form-
ing a party of their own, and farm-workers
and peasants are forming another. ' The
soft hi —political gangsters who are regu-
larly employed by all parties to add point
to their public arguments by a little bombing
or sword-thrusting in private—have been
particularly active lately, and some extra-
brutal examples of their art, alleged to have
been on behalf of the Minister'alists, sug-
gest that the bureaucracy is making a hard
fight for it. Another effort to restore the
waning samurai spirit was the appointing
of ex-army officers, thrown out of a job
through retrenchment and the failure of the
Siberian expedition, to the schools and uni-
versities, for the purpose of instilling loyalty
into the students by the methods of the drill-
sergeant. A general strike of small boys
resulted in the abandonment of the project.
Another disturbing factor, a result of the
Japo-Russian treaty, is the appearance in
the country of large number of Bolsheviks, a
rush of young Japan to master the intri-
cacies of' the Slay tongue, and a general
show of interest in the millennial preach-
ings of Moscow. This the Government is
endeavoring to counter bya Peace Preservation
Bill, aimed at checking radical activities,
especially in Labor circles. Altogether, the
Land of the Rising Sun seems to be badly
in need of something in the nature of a
foreign diversion to distract her crowded
population from the disenchanting spectacle
of home politics and the fruitless struggle
to maintain a decent standard of living in
the face of a constantly increasing birth-
rate.
♦—
The Crime of Being an Orphan.
When the Great War called, one young
Australian who sailed away to his death
left a little daughter behind. Later she lost
her mother, and was then quite alone in the
world. The Repatriation Department took
her up. and had her educated at the Drum-
moyne (N.S.W.) High School; and the
State, no doubt with the best of intentions,
became her foster-parent. Eventually the
child was “boarded out” to someone who was
willing to adopt her for a consideration —
10s. per week is the amount usually allowed.
All went w T ell till recently, when the guar-
dian decided to return the war-made orphan
to the care of the State. She was now in
her 14th year, and at the age of 14 the Stato
has decreed that the allowance for the up-
keep of its orphans shall cease —at this age
the wards are supposed to be able to earn
their own living. Handed over to the N. S.
Wales Child Welfare Department, the soldier's
orphan was placed by that body in the Girls’
Shelter at the Glebe. This is the place where
girls and young women under 18 who have
committed breaches of the law, or who are
considered uncontrollable or neglected, are
housed. Young women who are picked up
off the streets or taken out of Chinese dens
are detained here, pending their appearance
before the Children’s Court. One can imagine
the mixture that results. Yet such arc this
hapless orphan’s companions and associates.
And her offenceV Simply that it is her great
misfortune to have lost her parents, the
father giving his life for his country. It
is to be hoped tlujt when the Repatriation
Department learns of the plight of this
friendless little offspring of “one of the
bravest things God ever made” it will do
the right and proper thing by her. Should
it fail, through red-tape or any other cause,
then a golden opportunity offers itself to the
Returned Soldiers' League to prove its loyalty
to the memory of a fallen comrade. And
while the League is about it it might inquire
what other orphans are on the same tainted
premises.

A Cloud in the Solomons.
From a trustworthy man in the Islands: —
During the last two or three years serious com-
plaints have been made by white residents against
native police and Government native servants, and
i* is difficult to silence the question whether grave
crimes have been satisfactorily investigated and th*
guilty ones adequately punished. Delinquencies are
lightly passed over, serious offences are not tracked
down, and the result has, for some time, been
apparent; the “boys” have come to feel that
when they are in the Government serviee
they are protected from the proper consequences
of their misdemeanors. We are not a people who
easily take the law into our own hands, and things
have lately happened in Tulagi that would haw
resulted in a public lynching or two had they
happened in another country.
A lively -little episode took place as far bac.’:
as during Christmas, 1922, at Tulagi. The police
were told that it was a holiday and that they could
go and enjoy themselves, which they proceeded to
do. Their merriment took a turn that was forcibly
resented by the white business people. The local
hotelkeeper found it necessary to address certain
steadying words to a crowd of unruly, mischief-bent
police, who had called with the obvious intention
of carrying out a little raid, and he took the
precauticn to enforce his remarks by looking at the
mob over the sights of a rifle. At a large general
store the frolics of the police had also to be
checked in much the same way by the white staff.
“All right! Take it out of the Chinamen,” thought
these innocent revellers, and they spent a merrv
hour or so in Chinatown. An indignant column
or so appeared in the Planter’s Gazette at the
time, and public opinion, as far as it can make
itself vocal in these islands, called for vigorous
punishment. The method of stopping a portion of
pay and reading the inevitable lecture does not fit a
crime of this nature, and the fun was worth it.
Unfortunately, this is not the worst. Incidents are
taking place which are making the white people
very uncomfortable. Has the Government created a
party of Robots ? Is the instrument created pre-
sumably for the carrying out of good government
and the enforcing of justice becoming the prime
transgressor? One hesitates to bring into the scope
of an article like this the names and station of
white, women who have been molested by these
ruffians, yet horrible incidents of this nature are
becoming all too frequent.
The most serious trouble is that these natives,
trained in insolence and cunning, in course of time
become scattered around the different plantations
as they finish their time with the Government, and
become indentured to planters.

The Flight of Australian Talent.
Harry Neville writes from the Friars’
Club, New York :
Knowing that The Bulletin takes an interest in
Australians abroad, I should like to let you know
that we do stick together. One of our number,
while playing in “Rain,” two years ago, had a
seizure, and was in hospital for 20 months. When
he was fit to travel, some of his fellow-Australians
raised enough to send him home to Sydney. We
could have collected sufficient for the family as
well, but the w T ife thought she had better prospects
of supporting the family (there are two children)
by playing in U.S. vaudeville. I enclose a balance-
sheet: the subscription list is pretty representative, as
you will see, although there are Australians we could
not get in touch with. Every one we asked promised
a contribution, and the only one who didn’t weigh
in is a comparatively new arrival, who has made
a hit and must be getting $750 a week. Perhaps
his donation miscarried or will come along later. In
brief, collections amounted to $725, of which $413
was handed to our friend on his arrival at Sydney.
The names of the contributors are subjoined :
Leon Errol, O. P. Heggie, Percy Grainger,
Judith Anderson, Harry Mowbray, Harry Plimmer,
Hugh J. Ward, Frank Green, John Quinlan.
Reynolds Dennistoun, Herbert Cavanaugh, Athol
Tier. “Snub” Pollard, Willie Bevan, Jack Dunn,
Jack Cherry, Herb. Cortiiell, Rolly’ Rushton,
David Bf.lbridge, Nellie Strang, Harry Clive,
George Hassell. L. Shannon. S. Cormick, Leonard
Willey, C. Mason. Walter Jardine, H. A. Bowden,
Will R. Barnes, David Glassford, Harry Neville,
Toai Curran, Harry Daunton, James Hughes,
Klwyn Harvey, A. J. Herbert, A. M. Rosko and
Miss Mack.
They are nearly all Australian-born theatri-
cal people who are doing well in New York,
where four, at least, have attained real
eminence. Almost as many Australians
have made good at Hollywood—consider the
Bennett girls, Enid and Marjorie, Sylvia
Bremer, Annette Iyellerman. Louise
Lovely, Elsie Wilson, Lotus Thompson,
Kupert Julian and Clyde Cook, to men-
tion only a few-. And the list of those who
have succeeded in London theatres, operatic
included, is impressive, though here incom-
plete :
Melba, Florence Austral, Lalla and Beatrice
Miranda, Gertrude Johnson, Elsa Stralia, Oscar
Asche, Alice Crawford, Pattie Browne, Hilda
Spong. Marie Lour. Madge and Dion Titheradge,
May Robson. Daphne Pollard, Norma Wiialley,
Betty Ward, Lorna and Toots Pounds, Ivy
Shilling, Eve Grey, Clarice Hardwicke, Madge
Elliott, Dorothy Seabrook, Willie Percy, Fred
Leslie, Peter Dawson, Mignon O’Dohekty, Edytii
Latimer arid Elsie Mackay.
Consideration of these scores of names, so
many of them distinguished, prompts an in-
quiry as to the causes of this persistent
migration of home-grown talent, which has
no parallel elsewhere. Why do so many
clever Australians leave their native Com-
monwealth, to which so few return ? Some
doubtless depart for family reasons. Others
go in search of European training and oppor-
tunities, having the necessary funds. Am-
bition and the spirit of adventure are also
present, of course. But the deciding factor
in many instances is the circumstance that
the actor or siuger hasn’t earned as much
as a wharf-laborer or milliner in good stand-
ing, and can see no local prospect worth
staying for. The position is that the enter-
tainment business is controlled by a few
wealthy groups which have little use for
anything except leg- and picture-shows, and
whose outlook is so foreign that 100 per cent,
of their plays and pictures and 70 or SO
per cent, of their principals are imported.
So our .7 it o [Tii Anderson’s and O. I’.
Meggies and Leon Eruot,B go abroad to
achieve Broadway fame, while third-raters
from overseas are foisted on the easy-going
Australian public as “stars.” Our theatrical
managers go abroad also—to compete for
the Australian rights in British, Ameri-
can and Oerm an-Austrian calf-comedies
(one has just returned with the thrill-
ing news that he snapped up “Mer-
cenary Mary,” “The Trial Honeymoon” and
“Lady, Be Good”!), while Australian play-
wrights, librettists and composers are left
out in the cold. The door is likewise locked
and bolted against the photoplay-writer, and
it is doubtful if there is one resident moving-
picture actor paying income-tax, although
the Amalgamation gleefully announces that
it now r runs 130 cinema-theatres with a capi-
tal of £3,000,000 in Australia and Maoriland.
In effect, while Sweden (population,
5.800.000, the same as Australia) has built
up a fine moving-picture industry, and while
Norway (population, 2.700,000) and Ire-
land (population, 4,500,000) have made dis-
tinguished contributions to dramatic litei’a-
ture—Dublin, with half the population of
Melbourne, maintains a theatre devoted to
the production of Irish plays—the Austra-
lian drama has been frozen out, and an Aus-
tralian moving-picture is an event. The
wealthy groups aforesaid own practically all
the city stages and picture-screens, with the
result that the Australian spirit is excluded
from the Australian playhouse. The remedy
perhaps lies in the building of municipal
theatres (one is projected in Newcastle)
or the improvement of existing town halls,
provided they are kept free from combine
control. Were a satisfactory municipal hall
available in each of the suburbs and sizable
towns —Sydney and Melbourne alone have
40 suburbs with a population ranging from
70,000 to 40,000 —this would be a profitable
circuit for half a dozen theatrical companies,
and perhaps a grand-opera co. or two, to-
gether with orchestras and picture-producers,
and these in turn would furnish opportuni-
ties for dramatists, scenario-writers, libret-
tists and composers. No country can afford
to lose so much native talent as this country
has lost during the last quarter of a cen-
tury. The exodus is costly to Australia
in palpable and impalpable ways. The
utilitarian side of the case is not the most
important, but it is important enough. There
is a connection between the stupid prejudice
against Australian-made goods which of re-
cent months has brought so much misery into
Australian homes, and the fact that the Aus-
tralian theatre has been given over for a
generation to imported stuff, much of it
shoddy, and to imported actors for the most
part.
N. S. Wales Labor’s Debt to T. J. Ley.
Tricky to the last, proportionalism helped
the N. S. Wales Labor party to win two of
the three Goulburn seats with less than half
the votes, and the result is that the Lang
Government, though representing a minority
of the electors who exercised the franchise,
will have a majority of two in the Assembly,
including the Speaker. Of 25,950 valid
primaries polled in Goulburn, the Labor three
got 12,045, Stokes, the Lud Mayor of
Sydney, being elected with SSB above the
quota (0490), while Perkins, the National-
ist, also had a surplus. When the also-rans
had been excluded, Tui.t.y (Labor) had 5705,
Bate (Nationalist) 3521, and Hedges (Pro-
gressive) 3510, 230 votes having been ex-
hausted and 10 lost by fractions. If the Pro-
gressive and Nationalist totals had been re-
versed, Hedges would have got in with a
majority of quite 1000, for nearly all the
Nationalists voted 4, 5 and 0 for Progres-
sives. And if the election had been fought
on political issues exclusively, the Progs,
would have reciprocated to the extent of at
least 90 p.c. of their preferences, which would
have made Bate the third member. As it
happened, Bate received 2018 Prog, prefer-
ences and Tur.i.Y 202, 1290 papers being
exhausted. Tully was elected with a total
of 5907, or 583 less than the quota, 12,39 <
votes out of 25,956 sufficing to put the two
Labor men in. For this the Nationalists
may thank their too clever Mr. Ley, pillar
of the proportional system and author of
the No Tcmerc legislation. The combination
of Ley’s silly fads pros on tod the Labor
people with seats which, in ordinary circum-
stances, they would have had no chance ot
winning (one of them was in Ley s own elec-
torate of St. George), and, in effect, placed
them in office. It has been suggested that
Ley is the right man to succeed 1 tiller as
leader of the beaten party. The Nationa is s
should get that notion right out of then-
heads. They will never carry N. 8- " aie.
with Ley as leader.

of grab as quiet as possible, and does not
wish public attention directed to it, while
the victims lack the means of making effec-
tive complaint. Thus the public in general
m kept in ignorance of the mean- mulcting
of the pauper, and the overflowing Treasury
continues without protest to rob the poorest
of the community of a fourth of the weekly
dole granted them by the Pensions Act. If
the victims in their thousands were politi-
cally important the matter would speedily
have the earnest attention of members of the
Commonwealth legislature. The grievance
would be voiced vigorously, and a howl of
public indignation would at once convince
the Bruce-Page combination that, even if
the present reduction of paupers’ pensions for
the benefit of the central Treasury be legal
under any clause in the statute (a question
which should be submitted to the High
Court), it is too despicably mean a proceed-
ing for further toleration by the Australian
people. No ‘justification of this contemptible
larceny—it is nothing less—has ever been
made public; and it is time the Priminister
was called upon to abolish the practice en-
tirely. Every pensioner should receive the
full amount to which he (or she) is entitled
by age or infirmity.
The fruits of the Washington Disarmament
Conference continue to ripen. A vast
battle-cruiser which was being built by
Japan when the late Warren Gamaliel
Harding played on the peace pipe was sacri-
ficed by the Tokio Government; that is to
say, orders were issued that it should be
converted into an aeroplane-carrier. This
has been accomplished, and the result is the
Akagi, 27,000 tons, 28 knots, 10 Sin. guns
and 16 4.7 in. guns. Possibly the 26 guns
are only to call her flock of 50 ’planes home
when night is failing, but the fact remains
that _ the “aeroplane-carrier” is much more
.heavily armed than the British, French and
Yankee fighting cruisers now being built
according to Washington Conference speci-
fications.
The scandalously light sentences passed
on the Victorian detectives convicted of con-
spiracy to blackmail have at least provoked
some pertinent comment from the Victorian
Court of Criminal Appeal. When the
Court refused leave for a rehearing of the
case, prisoners’ counsel asked that their 12
months’ sentence be dated from the day of
their appeal, May 15. The reply of Irvine,
C.J., was instructive. He remarked that the
Court had anticipated such an appeal and
would not allow it. in view of the gravity of
the offences and the “remarkable leniency”
of the sentence. So the errant watchdogs
have gained nothing by their appeal but an
extra montli in the calaboose.

The latest upheaval at Canton, South China,
where fighting has broken out between the
Bolshevised Kuo-min-tang troops and the
Yunnanese mercenaries who have held the
city since 1922, recalls an unadvertised
odyssey that equals the famous exploit of the
Czecho-Slovak army in Siberia. This Yun-
nan army set out over three years ago from
its inland province to join with the late
Sun Yat Sen in a grandiose, expedition
■'gainst Pekin. As usual, Sun failed to
eventuate, and the Yunnan men were left in
the air, with hostile provinces in front and
behind them. By slow degrees they worked
their way southwards, capturing and collect-
ing the rates in the cities on their route,
and even staying awhile here and there to
compel the populace to plant opium so that
they could reap the benefit, the drug being
a handy medium of exchange. They at
length reached and captured the human ant-
heap which functions more or less as the
capital of Kuangtung, and although cordially
"detested they have stayed there ever since.
Their latest defeat leaves them no alter-
native at all, because even if they succeed in
fighting their way back through the terri-
tories they have despoiled, their own pro-
vince has in their absence fallen into the
bands of a militarist from still another pro-
vince.
Dear Bulletin, —Will you hear another
heart-felt wail in support of anti-quack legis-
lation’? Because Chinese engineers built the
Great Wall we do not accept the Chinese
engineer of to day without modern creden-
tials. Yet many of us do accept Wu Chang
Yang, who drops mysteriously into town,
nuts up his sign, holds your hand, sees your
inmost organs, gives the sufferer a par-
cel of remedies and dismisses him after the
deposition of a handsome fee. Any voice
raised in defence of the herb-mongers is two
thousand years old. and is identical with that
of the priest who gave forth chants and
prayers over the sufferer visiting the Grsecian
shrines of Aesculapius and that ilk. Here
disease was cured by faith, and the adminis-
tration of vile animal and vegetable decoc-
tions. Chinese medicine is older than Greek
tliaumaturgy and has progressed no more
than has Chinese civilisation in general. The
Chinese herbalist administers his drug with
the same fidelity to tradition and
the same faith in the mysterious as
did his progenitor of 25 centuries ago.
He has not learned that diagnosis is the
first step in the treatment of disease; that
.adequate nursing is the second; that the
judicious administration of the proper drug
requires careful superintending by a man
who has trained for his job; that some dis-
eases need surgical treatment. He will never
realise that infusions of barks, turtles and
red meats will not cure a cancer or syphilis,
which he regards as a simple sore. A
chemist trains for three or four years, and
then he is permitted to handle dangerous
drugs; a wise one never administers them ;
but tho Chinese herbalist is allowed to posi-
tively help the ravages of disease without
oven an undertaker’s certificate. —Yours,
R.S.L.

“T. Jasper” : The slump in wool values calls
attention again to the two great dangers
that menace our most important industry.
One is the exportation of stud sheep abroad,
notably to South Africa, whose competition
has been a factor in bringing about the
present debacle. The other is the mongrel-
isation of our flocks. The proportion of long
wools and assorted crosses to pure merinoes
lias risen during the last quarter of a cen-
tury from almost nothing to something alarm-
THE MIGHTY ATOM.
The ant can lift enormous weights in comparison with its size; but one member of the Seamen’s
Union can do much more—he is capable of holding up a liner, its cargo and its, passengers.
mg. In the case of very inferior wools, when
profitable prices prevail for them there is
not the strong incentive to improve that
exists when a decent standard is necessary
to secure payable returns. One result of a
relatively lean period in prices may, there-
fore, be a tightening-up of regulations relat-
ing to exportation of studs. Another pro-
bability is an all-round improvement in the
quality of fleece produced. Incidentally, we
may destroy the dingoes and the rabbits with
more enthusiasm if the exigencies of the
situation demand it. It is, perhaps, but
sorry satisfaction for the men who have
missed the big prices to hear it, but un-
doubtedly booms are dangerous. They in-
spire ill-founded hopes and schemes, and
lull thought to sleep, and the results come
home to roost in the most unexpected and
embarrassing fashion.

It is possible that Amundsen—-and possibly
Andree before him—struck something at the
point on which the world spins that has never
been even imagined. The fact that the South
Pole is about the same as any other place
for some miles around is no proof that the
North Pole is equally tame. It may, indeed,
be the maddest place on the planet, with the
force of gravity turned upside down and a
direct open air-passage to the Milky Way.
Science has disproved so many of the settled
axioms of science lately that the wildest
guess may be true. And, anyhow, either
or both of the explorers mentioned, and
Hudson as well, may return some day. Long
ago it was pointed out that a person frozen
up suddenly would not be satisfactorily dead
at all. With sound organs in good condition
before the freezing, and with the perfect
preservation of all the meat part of him that
constant frost would assure, there is no plain
reason why he should not be thawed to life
again and have his breathing artifically re-
started. The discovery of Henry Hudson
in a block of ice might bo of far greater
interest and importance than the opening
of the oldest Pharaoh’s tomb. Hudson was
last in touch with civilisation in April, 1610.
He had lived through the latter years of
Elizabeth, knew the London of Ben
Jonson and Christopher Marlowe and had
said hard things about the new king who
could keep a man like Raleigh in the Tower.
If Hudson, with his early-seventeentli-
century outlook, were found frozen intact
and properly thawed out to twentieth-
century life, he should be precious to every
lover of history. There are a thousand ques-
tions that he could aaiswer off hand; but
there would be a doubt whether he could give
an answer to the greatest of all. When
50.000 enthusiasts set his lately-thawed ear
tingling with the demand to know who wrote
the Siiakspeare plays he would probably turn
a grey eye towards the north and reply : "I
beseech you, sirs, make an end. What fellow
jISV s °l L ft sta S?-P.laying vaga-
bond! 1 would I had them all in stocks for
the harm they do to the spirit of true men.
1 had as lief be dead in a tavern brawl as
sit on a stool to watch the antics of a king
with a pasteboard crown.” But Hudson
would have a very fair idea about the value
of the Spanish treaty, and whether English
homes of the period were as unclean as some
modern writers say or as sweet as a con-
temporary French writer found them.
“Machete” : The director of the U.S.A.
Medical Bureau of Investigation has reported
that Prohibition cannot be s „c« SS t„, until
certain patent medicines (lie cited 60 as
‘produeing intoxication without ill effects”)
have been suppressed. Possibly he is refer-
ring to new medicines ’ which have been
evolved under the pressure of Prohibition;
but there are well-known compounds widely
consumed in Australia which carry a genuine
kick. If • Secret Remedies, published under
authority of the British Medical Association,
can be believed, one very well-known cough
mixture yielded 40 parts by volume of alco-
hoi. Two consumption cures contained 28.5
per cent, by volume and 21. fluid parts of
alcohol respectively A ‘blood medicine
showed 23 p.c. of alcohol, another 19.6 p.c.
lonics ranged from a 10 p.c. content of
lmre alcohol to 23.5 p.c. But the absolute
gem ot the collection was a drink cure adver-
tised to destroy the taste for liquor in four
days; it held 30 p.c. by volume of alcohol.
Like the medicinal bitters ' which the craze
for teetotalism brought into being in America
years ago. these medicines mostly go to com-
fort people who profess total abstinence. N<)
wonder the written testimonials are so glow-
ing ! The temperance advocate whose depres-
sion has vanished after he has taken “half a
bottle of your invaluable medicine"—2s p.e.
pure alcohol—is apt to see things in the rosi-
est of lights.
♦
"Wog” : Is it not remarkable that a pros-
perous State like N. S. Wales does not
possess an up-to-date T.B. sanatorium? The
only Government institution for sufferers
from the disease is the Home for Consump-
tives at Waterfall, from which this is
written, and which is, what it was originally
intended to be, a dying-place for tubercular
folk, where the “good” cases are jumbled
with the bad, and where no real treatment
is offered. Yet, in spite of the. obsolete con-
ditions, the place .is overcrowded, and for
the first time in its history a number of
patients are being discharged. As most of
these men are homeless, a very serious situa-
tion arises. To add irony to their fate, the
jority were born in this State ; yet they are
to go while unnaturalised foreigners remain.
Although Waterfall is being maintained by
the State of N. S. Wales, only 30 per cent,
of the inmates were born here; for, owing
to the lax laws governing admission, it has
been made the dumping-ground for all and
sundry. Nor will the present scheme of the
lied Cross Society help the poorer civilian
consumptives, as very few of us are in the
fortunate position of being able to live any-
where as paying guests. If the Red Cross
Society desires to give the greatest possible
help to consumptives, I would suggest that
it follow the excellent example of the village
settlements in England. With such agencies
established a large proportion of sufferers
would in a short period again become useful
and self-supporting members of the commu-
nity.
Borom’ : The action of the Ford Co. in
buying an ancient pub which stands close
to its works site at Geelong means, presum-
ably, that Henry is going to introduce into
liis Australian factory some of the rules re-
garding liquor that he has always imposed
upon his employees at Detroit (TT.S.A.) and
other places. Amongst these is one pre-
scribing instant sack for any man who brings
alcoholic drink within the factory’s limits,
or who comes to work intoxicated, or shows
signs of having been in that condition. A
hard and fast preference to teetotallers is
given not only in applications for employ-
ment, but in all matters affecting promo-
tion. At Detroit the “welfare department”
makes a practice of investigating the private
lives of employees, and any of the latter dis
covered to be in the habit of frequenting
places where liquor is sold are first warned,
and then, if the warnings have no effect,
discharged. With -an enormously greater
reservoir of labor to draw upon, and
in a country where a man’s private life is
never secure from the attentions of reformers
of some sort, such things may be done; but
any attempt to tell the Australian workman
whether he shall or shall not have a drink
when lie feels like one. or to dictate to him
how he shall spend his own time, will en-
counter vigorous, opposition. In this re-
spect . the psychologies of the Australian and
American workmen differ markedly.

“Kazan’ - : Considering that I am not a
shop bookmaker, I have achieved a telephone
witli remarkable speed. A man came along
from the Department a week after I
had lodged my application and deposited the
necessary five pounds. He studied the topo
graphy of the house, pointed out where an
old line ended and how hard it would be to
I'ick up the new one, and launched into other
technicalities well beyond my understanding.
Finally, he said that I might have my ’phone
in a few days, but that, owing to the diffi
culties of the situation, there might be a
delay of several weeks; that, of course, it all
rested with him (a meaning look here), and
that he would do his best. I mentioned how
much it all meant to me, and hinted at grati-
tude. The following day another man came
with another tale of difficulties to be over-
come. He overcame them somehow, and laid
the line. _ Next day the mechanic installed
the “set.” To him I gave five shillings, and
his gratitude was surprising. I was out on
the three occasions when the first man called
to see if the ’phone was giving satisfaction ;
and when the man who laid the wire made
the same tender inquiries he seemed reluctant
to leave. In the circumstances, I expect to
hear presently that my instrument is re-
quired for Beupher, the bookie, who has
three numbers already.

POLITICAL
POINTS
George Fuller’s exit from the N.S.W. Pre-
miership was gentlemanly but not strenu-
ous, like all his doings. Some men would
not have left an accumulation of eight vacan-
cies, or thereabouts, in the Upper House for
his successor to (ill with partisans, and be-
cause of that neglect the rush of applicants
for the ostensibly profitless billets is already
like the charge of the Light Brigade. And
some men would have hung on till Parlia-
ment met, for the sake of keeping a hold on
the Treasury till the end of the financial
year. With even two weeks’ run the Langs
and Lazzarinis may make a fine hole in the
surplus, and then blame Fuller for the situa-
tion. Holman went out on April 11, 11)20,
and the deficit which his successors manu-
factured in the 80 days that remained was
like the Blue Mountains.
The Baldwin-Ohurchill preferences had a
smooth passage in the House of Commons,
20 Labor members voting with the majority.
It will be some time before the effects of the
fruit, wine, hops and tobacco preferences are
felt, but the sugar concession will benefit
Queensland immediately. It will make a
difference of anything between £500,000 and
£750,000 on the sales of this year’s surplus.
Feng Yu-hsiang, the famous Christian
General, has declared that in the event o 1
hostilities breaking out between Britain and
China, he will be found on the Chinese side,
lie says that China need not fear England,
which has a large navy but a small army.
Feng’s talk owes its bigness to the fact
that Russia and Germany have overland com-
munication with him. He is in direct com-
mand of 00,000 well-trained troops, and liis
satellites control another quarter of a million.
But a large consignment of fresh argument,
including Bolshevik-built aeroplanes, arrived
to his address via the Siberian railway the
other day.
The first no-confidence motion of the Fed-
eral session has served to make it clear that
the Labor party is opposed to building cruis-
ers because it believes in Wasliington Dis-
armament Conferences and is also in
favor of building cruisers because some
of Bill Mahony’s constituents and Jock Gar-
den’s proteges are out of work. _ When the
tariff comes up for revision it is expected
that Labor will declare itself solidly Protec-
tionist with a firm faith in the grand old
principles of Freetrade.
Lang’s first hurdle: — .
“Socialisation’; is already beginning to worry the
winners of the N.S.W. election. Sydney Labor Coun-
il conjured up the familiar spirit at its last meet-
ng, when five South Coast miners’ lodges asked the
Council’s support in insisting that the Lang Govern-
ment socialise the coalmines within the next three
years. Forthwith there was a whoop of agreement,
which died down when delegates began to inquire
just what was proposed. Jacob Johanson wanted
to know why mines alone should be socialised. Why
not the shipping industry also? And did the South
Coast miners really want socialism or nationalisa-
tion? Yawcob assured the meeting that all the
troubles of the Commonwealth line had arisen from
the capitalistic system in which it was enmeshed,
and he anticipated similar troubles if the mines
were nationalised. The only thing to be done, Mr.
Johanson said, was- to hurry on the social revolu-
tion —socialise nothing until the “working class” was
ready for the overthrow of the capitalist and all his
satellites, and then socialise—not nationalise —
everything at once. In the end the Council agreed
to urge the socialisation-within-three-years policy,-
but it will first obtain a “consensus of opinion” from
all the miners’ lodges in order to increase the press-
ure on poor old Lang.
Labor secured four of the six Denison
scats at the Tasmanian elections, the fourth
man, Cleary, M.L.A.. just squeezing in for
sixth place ahead of Grant, M.L.A. There
were 16 candidates, the list commencing with
three “C's,” Cleary, Cosgrove, Culley. These
were all elected. The other successful Labor
man, Woods, was at the very bottom of the
ballot-paper. The two anti-Labor men who
scored highest, Soundy and McPhee, gained
no alphabetical advantage. Of course it is
impossible to reduce the alphabetical gain
or loss to figures, but everything points to
the likelihood of Cleary’s position at the top
of the ballot-paper having helped him con-
siderably. The chances are that other-
BLIGHTING THE BROTH.
“The Victorian Outer Ports Commission consists of a solicitor, four farmers, an ex-State-school
teacher and a tanner. Recently, when the Prime Minister suggested that they should avail themselves of
the services and advice of Sir Geo. Buchanan, a world authority on ports and harbors, the Commission
replied that there was nothing the eminent engineer could tell them that they did not know."
THE OLD LADY (to Sir G. Buchanan ): "You may hr an expert chef, young feller, hut.
if they wanted this broth cooked properly they wouldn't have appointed me.
So push off!"
wise Labor's fourth man for Denison would
have been a woman —Mrs. Lyons—who was
barely three score votes behind Cleary when
the guillotine descended. The other woman
candidate, Mrs. Watcrworth (Women’s Non-
political League), who polled some 1200
primary votes at last, elections, on this occa-
sion just missed losing her £l5, the Labor
woman (an attractive personality and the
island’s best platformer) taking the bulk of
the purely feminine vote. As Mrs. Burnell,
the woman candidate for Darwin, has failed
to get a seat, the Speck’s new Parliament
will have to rub along without a lady help.
The usual tale of melancholy comes from
the isolated N. Territory. Last year it is
estimated that the white population dimin-
ished by nine, leaving 2281. and the imported
colored population by 25. leaving 1018. How-
ever, three new Commissioners with their
retinues will be going up soon, which will
give the white total quite a lift.
The policy of keeping down the local out-
put per worker in order to diminish unem-
ployment instead of trying to keep down im-
ports and letting local production go its hard-
est (for adequate wages) has a fatal fascina-
tion. Melbourne Trades Hall Council lately
put its ban on workers suspected of odd-
jobbing in spare hours, and some aldermen
of Sydney have made long and ardent search
for municipal employees who were alleged
to be Saturday-brcakers. Britain doesn’t
borrow money abroad as these States do to
provide scraps of employment (last year our
foreign borrowings ran to over 33 millions),
so there a big exodus is reported from the
unions—chiefly of men who want to take to
piecework, and hustle to see if they can’t
keep ahead of Hun competition.
The inquiry into VVestralia’s alleged
Federal wrongs and grievances drags along.
A recent witness was Westralia’s Assistant
Under-Treasurer, who alleged that his State
lost £2.133,000 through its gold output being
bought up at a fixed price by the Common-
wealth Government during the war. He
said it would "be difficult to restrain the
people” if the money isn't forthcoming. But,
if it is forthcoming the Government can
hardly do else than hold it for distribution
among the war-time mine-owners ' and share-
holders who lost it, and so few of the share-
holders live in Westralia that that State's
proportion will be very small. And when it
is called on for its share of compensation to
the eastern States, which also had their gold
commandeered, its people may be wild enough
to cast off all restraint and revert to
savagery.
“Valli": An article on “Race Pollution'’
(B. 28/5/’25) contends that Australia is
not strict enough in her examination of
migrants. Some confirmation of this came
my way last week, when our newly-arrived
little Cockney maid confided to us that it
was her desire to assist the rest of her family
to come to Australia, including a brother,
who was subject to fits. I expressed doubt
whether the afflicted member would be
accepted. “Oh, once he gets aboard he will
be all right,” said Miss Pommy cheerfully.
“Three mad people came out with us, and
they all passed the doctor. And one of them
was very bad, too.” she added, reminiscently
—“we were all afraid of her on the voyage.”
In Melbourne the other day the Tariff
Board was intruded on by the representa-
tives of four local whisky mills. They
pointed out. that Australian whisky is sup-
posed to get a small preference over im-
ported liquor, it being taxed 20s. or 28s. per
gallon while the foreign article pays 80s.
But to get this trifle of Protection it has to
live, at heavy cost, up to a high standard of
quality, while imported usquebaugh may
be almost any old thing. As a result, the
single State of N.S.W., in the last year _for
which figures are available, spent £00.1,500
on extraneous whisky; also Australia main-
tains, at a loss of over a million a year when
everything is added up, a fleet to bring such
goods here at less than tliecost of carriage. The
Board maintained the same reticent attitude
as it has for the past four years, but it is
thought that something may be done for local
industry after Bruce has finished appoint-
ing the three Northern Territory Commis-
sioners and the “ambassador” to London.
For this last-named position at least one
politician’s application has already poured in.
So much do Allan and Peacock like the
recess that they have determined to stretch
it out till the last minute. They must have
supply by July 10, and they will meet just
in time to get it. As the American fleet will
drop in on July 23 there will, of course,
be another little vacation then; and no
serious work will be attempted till after that
date.
When U.S. Secretary of State Kellog de
dared that the Government of Mexico was
on its trial before the world, -lie got what
he was asking for. The retort of the Mexi-
can Government was that if the Government
of the discolored Republic was on its trial,
so was the Government of the parti-colored
one, along with all the Governments of all
the world. It also rejected with energy and
scorn the imputation that it. was on trial in
the guise of defendant. It is some time since
the Indianised hidalgos have remembered
their ancient pride to this extent; and the ex-
tensive immigration of Japanese into Mexi-
co, together with the present situation in the
Yeast, where Japan, for the first time since
the scrapping of the treaty with Britain, has
come out openly as the champion of the
colored races against the white, may have
much to do with it.
One of the woes for which Westralian poli-
ticians claim that their State should be com-
pensated by its neighbors is the decline in
the railway revenue. In reality the gross
earnings of W.A. lines in recent years have
advanced like this :
1918- £1,872.897 | 1921-22 .. £2,827,856
1919- . . 2,291,876 | 1922-23 .. 2,915,985
1920- . . 2,720,032 | 1923-24 . . 3,227,000
The net earnings (surplus over working ex-
penses) went up in the same period from
£305,000 to £929,000, and for the year just
closed Westralia had a bigger rise in net
railway revenue than any other State. In
fact, it did better than the railway systems
of N.S.W., Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania
and the Commonwealth all put together.
Their joint increase of railway income was
£197,000, while Westralia’s was £223,000.
Yet it is quite possible, as one witness said,
that the people of the Golden West are so
wild about their “losses” that they are almost
capable of insurrection. It is all a matter
of credulity. A Mohammedan mob has been
known to demand compensation for an eclipse
of the sun.
The 44-hour system for public servants
hadn’t quite started in Queensland before a
hole the size of a horse and cart developed.
The new idea, in addition to vindicating a
sacred principle, would have furnished em-
ployment for another 300 deserving cops,
and as the Queensland force is actually
smaller than it was in 1915, the addition
might have been useful. But the Police
Union took a hand. Possibly it didn’t want
to open its books to more members, and the
employment of free-labor constables would
have been anomalous. So it has been de-
cided to introduce the nefarious overtime or
bonus device, and stick to the old 5G hours.
The , idea seemingly is that 1113 tired long-
hour policemen with a bonus can overtake
as many criminals as 1413 fresh, short-hour
policemen without a bonus, and it may be
so—in Queensland.
The win-tie-or-wrangle section of the Vic.
Cocky party is still trying to make things
uncomfortable for Premier Allan. Farmer
.John was “permitted” to join a Composite
Cabinet, for the second time, provided that
he bagged the Premiership, but the radical
malcontents, who don’t know exactly what
they want, are now trouncing him because he,
being leader of a party of 12 divided into two
groups, does not stockwhip the 23 Libs, and
Ind. Libs, with whom he is allied into doing
his bidding. The immediate cause of quarrel
is that Allan didn’t have a poll of wheat-
growers taken to ascertain whether they
wanted a compulsory pool in Vic. As the
two big K.C.’s, Mitchell and Dixon, had
advised that a pool in a single State would
be ineffective, Allan didn’t see the use of a
compulsory pool, but offered to finance a
voluntary pool for five years with an advance
of 75 p.c. of wheat values, lie is hoping to
overcome his critics at a Farmers’ Union
meeting this week, just as he did at the
March conference.

Through good repute or ill, foul weather or fair
Whoever else deserted and assailed you
To take your part old “Brig.” was always there.
’Mid all the wild political commotion,
The storms about your head that beat and blew,

But now—oh II—11!- I’m through.
A couple quaint, plebeian and patrician,
Into such close association hurled,
A soldier 1 and you a politician
(Statesman is what I used to tell the world).
My prince of patriots once, my leader trusted,
The idol I adored from day to day,
It leaves me disillusioned and disgusted
To see your feet such clay!
You, erst my inspiration and my anchor,
Upon whose words 1 hung with ardor keen,
Sunk to a pool of black and bitter rancor,
A futile geyser of malignant spleen!
Oft have I whistled mournfully and shrilly,
But ne’er expressively of such a jar
As when contrasting what I thought you, Billy,
With what I find you are.
Farewell ! But, stay, ere from my heart 1 cast that
Image of you I kept so shining bright,
One service yet I may perform, the last that
A faithful squire may do a worthless knight.
I gloried in your fame. With anger glowing
And sorrow deep I saw you on the shelf.
Shame in your shame I cannot keep from showing
Say, have you none yourself ?

tralian Bight. The bridegroom was a tele-
graph operator, the bride the only white
spinster in the settlement. I was second
mate of the little steamer that brought stores
to the isolated port from Albany every three
months, and I had to superintend the land-
ing of the cargo—per surf-boat. On this
occasion, as each boatload reached the beach,
there were anxious inquiries about half a
dozen cases of “bubbly” which had been
ordered by wire at Albany to lend additional
eclat to the festivities. Unfortunately for
the wedding guests, the fizz turned out to
have been left behind. Faces lengthened at
the prospect of a dry wedding, but the situa-
tion was saved when an old bushwhacker,
who occupied a hut a few miles out, gener-
ously came to light with a large keg of rum.
That night at the wedding ‘breakfast the
voice that breathed had a distinct aroma of
old Jamaica. Every male present was blith-
ered except the bridegroom, and lie had all
liis work cut out to discourage various sozzled
well-wishers who wanted to kiss the bride.
The Eucla Recorder —a diminutive news-
sheet run by the telegraphists—printed its
account of the ceremony under the heading,
“A Rummy Wedding.” The wine caught
the next boat —three months later —and
helped to brighten up Eucla’s Christmas.

“R.N.W.”: In the controversy over mar
riages I haven’t seen the question raised as
to how far away the knot-tier may be. But
among clerics who have officiated at some
little distance was one of South Australia’s
best-remembered priests and scientists, Julian
Tenison Woods, who wrote the first officially-
recognised report upon the mineral wealth
o! the N.T. Father Woods had arranged to
marry a couple on a certain day near Struan
station, NarracoOrte (S.A.), at a spot
adjacent to a deep creek. On the wedding-
day this happened to be flooded and impass-
able, with bride and bridegroom under a tail
gum on one bank and the priest on the other.
His Reverence did the job across the water,
though I can’t say whether he heard the
responses.- The particular tree which cano-
pied the happy pair lost its top branches
in a cyclone later, but was still a stately
giant when I last saw it. And the name
“Father Woods” still clung to it.
* * * *
“North Terrace”: Adelaide provides the
latest illustration of the perils of marrying
in haste. A young Englishman employed on
a coastal boat made the acquaintance of a
possible affinity, and whenever his craft was
at Port Adelaide the two spent a lot of time
together. One day the girl chanced to say
coquettishly that she was thinking of get-
ting married. On being asked to whom, she
replied, “Oil, any one.” Thereupon the man
remarked, “I’ll bet you a fiver you aren’t
game to marry me.” The bet was taken,
and half an hour later the pair left the
registry office as man and wife. Almost im-
mediately the bride became perturbed as to
what her parents would say, and after refus-
ing to allow her husband to break the news
went to the police-station and bogged the
sergeant to get her marriage annulled before
her parents could find out. She went home
with her confidence in police omniscience
badly shattered. Meantime the ’groom had
been put off his ship for being absent with-
out leave, with 6LI. in his possession. How-
ever, friends got him a new job on shore.
But whether he has paid the wager is not
clear.

“H.H.”: The fruit-canning season at
Leeton (N.S.W.) between December and
March provides work for about 500 women and
girls from ail partis
of Australia; there
were two from Tas-
mania this year,
and the furthest-
north contribution
came from Rock-
hampton, The
“girls” are a curi-
ously assorted lot;
there are some set-
tlers’ wives who
help to keep the
family pot boiling,
and factory lasses
may he seen work-
ing side by side
with girls who are
earning money in
their off-time to
help them through
university courses.
Mostly the same
women apply for
the jobs every year,
though there are
always a few re-
cruits. Last season
some of the girls
made pays of £22
for a fortnight’s
work, but they were
experts who worked
overtime at time
and a half rates.
Still good money can be made at the ordinary

“Oxmead : The discovery that South Aus.

nals to colonies with better accommodation
for them (B. 4/6/25) is a ?cct°
western part of the contment was, to a ce
tain extent, a convict settlement betoie it

British statesmen had bad dreams about the

who had been “re-convicted of lighter crimes
at Botany Bay.” The party arrived at King
George’s Sound (Albany) on Christmas Day,
and the convicts, or re-convicts, sustained
a rather lean existence there, along with
their military guardians, for more than four
years. Then they were withdrawn, in defer-
ence to the feelings of the promoters of the
Swan River Settlement, who had made it
a condition of their enterprise that no con-
victs -were to be sent to the new colony, and
who were naturally just as strenuously

opposed to the idea of taking over any whom
they might find there. Twenty years later
Westralia was petitioning the Imperial Gov-
ernment for supplies of what some local his-
torian has referred to as “Britain’s erring
children”; it was accommodated with nearly
ten thousand of them between 1850 and
1868.

“H. Ilorsecollar”: After an election some-
thing should be done for the candidate who
got fewest votes —some trifle of recognition
such as a butter-bowl or the like. I don’t
think there were any very remarkable cases
in N.S.W. this time, but there is always
the chance of one. I seem to recall a case
in Maoriland long ago when the candidate
secured only one vote, which was his own.
Even then he was arrested on a charge of
impersonation, but I forget the details.

“Sucre”: There is more in palmistry (B.
11/6/’25) than meets the eye of the foolish
folk who indulge in it. At Warwick (S.Q.)
a yokel consulted one of the prophetesses.
After “palming” him she received a one-
pound note from a roll drawn by Hayseed
from his flannel shirt. “Stay, sir, one
moment,” exclaimed the lady, taking his
hand again. “Now I can see that you will
suffer a great loss shortly.” Two miles out
of Warwick Hayseed was sandbagged and
robbed of £49.

“Black Swan”: A story told the other day
in a Westralian court was to the effect
that a lady, who may be called Brambler,
was separated from her husband but wanted
her complete freedom. So she wrote out and
signed, to her own complete satisfaction,
what she regarded as the necessary form, and
sent it to Brambler for his autograph. He
didn’t sign, but apparently not out of any
great disbelief in the validity of such a pro-
ceeding. It was apparently the idea of the
divorcee and her sister that the divorce was
good without Brambler’s name, he having
been offered a fair chance. Anyhow, the
dame married Spike, who seems to have like-
wise regarded the transaction as legitimate;
and it isn't certain that they see anything
really erratic about it yet.

“Centurion”; The Kenya (East Africa)
advertisement for a public executioner (B.
li/6/’25) is a reminder that the calling is less
skilled and intricate than it once was. La
Bruy ere, the seventeenth-century commenta-
tor, has laid it down that an executioner
should be “a good man, a master of his art,
reliable, soft, hardy, courteous, full of pity
and affable. ’ It seems a large order, but in
the France of those days a man doubtless
bad better opportunities for learning the
elements of his craft, seeing that there was
an official executioner for every provincial
capital. Nowadays the job is far more cir-
cumscribed, too. In the Middle Ages it
covered such a range of the art as called
for a brilliant specialist. A list of execu-
tioneer’s fees under the Holy Roman Empire
shows that the artist was expected to lie an
adept in quartering, beheading and burning,
strangling and burning, burning alive, break-
ing alive on the wheel, tearing before execu-
tion with red-hot pincers, nailing a tongue
or hand, and other several and assorted
duties. Tearing asunder with four horses
was in a category by itself, and the fee for
that was a special one —five and a half
thalers. Save for flogging, which I under-
stand is a matter of contract, the modern
executioner may be a comparative amateur.

“Two Seas”: I can give one instance of a
Judge hearing some straight talk from a jury-
man (B. 28/5/’25). It was when his Honor
“Baking-powder” Gibson, who was too fond
of making satirical observations to wayback
jurors and witnesses, was trying a case m
the N.S.W. township where he had earned
his sobriquet. Gibson was displeased with
the verdict that had been returned, and cast
doubts upon the jury’s intelligence. Where-
upon the foreman, a young cocky, arose and
addressed the amazed Bench in manner fol-
lowing : “You wouldn’t dare to talk like that
to a Sydney jury, and you are not going to
do it here without a protest. I rode 25
miles, leaving work of importance, to
come here and do my duty _as a
juror, and I decline to be insulted
by you. I think I and my fellow
jurymen have as much intelligence as you
have, and certainly a far better understand-
ing of the case we have been called to decide
upon.” Most people in court expected to see
the speaker run into a cell for contempt or
lese-majeste; but nothing happened. Hie
Judge merely muttered, “That’ll do, that’ll
do,” and retired hurriedly after discharging
the prisoner. But the juror was the hero of
the township for that evening, and a very
wet one it was.

“Light Horse”: That “Waterloo ball” (B.
4/6/’25) did not take place on the eve of
Waterloo, but on the Thursday night pre-
vious to the battle —fought on a Sunday.
In the late evening news came of Napoleon’s
advance, and the officers present were ordered
to rejoin their regiments at once. Welling-
ton himself was at the ball, and took a
ceremonious farewell of the hostess, the
Duchess of Richmond. The troops from
Brussels marched to reinforce Picton, hold-
ing Ney’s advance at Quatre-Bras. They
checked him so severely that they were able
to fall back all Saturday to the position
chosen by Wellington at Waterloo, where, as
every A.I.F. man who has been in Flanders
must.have heard, the Belgians won the battle.
This is commemorated on the field by a big
mound with the Belgian lion (not the futile
beast from Angleterre), with his tail proudly
up. on top of it.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I rent a cottage, and three or lour
Yards of lawn between street and door,
And certainly not a square foot more.
But what 1 yearn for is ten times ten
Thousand of acres to roam, and then
My soul could march as a man of men.
I own a sort of garden-liose
Which, every Sunday morning, throws
A pint of water on yonder rose.
But what would content me, right or wrong,
Would be a river, or billabong,
At least a hundred or so leagues long.
Being well married, I have a mild
Temper, if such it may be styled.
Frankly, I never would dare get wild.
But what I want is a flashing sword.
Then, when my temper has missed a chord,
I’d slaughter my enemies, horde on horde.
I’ve said that I have a wife. Yes, yes !
Perfection’s pattern, as one might guess.
A model of every worthiness.
But what I would choose is ninety-nine
Sundry, assorted and clandestine
Cinema vamps to be mine, all mine.
In some strange manner I’ve chanced to lob
Right in a most respectable job;
The weekly salary—ninety bob.
But what I would really prefer is just
To raise a cloud of unholy dust
And fade on a brewery-bursting bust.
I have a custom, at each New Year,
To mutter a few weak words of cheer,
And wash them down with a glass of beer.
But what I would have, each time I dine,
Is wine. Yes, flagons and magnums of wine,
Or bubbly in buckets, line on line.
Some day, no doubt, I will chance to die,
And wear a halo of new three-ply,
And tinkle a harp along the sky.
But rather far would I haunt the coast
And revel by seas of life, a most
Outrageous and quite uproarious ghost.
Meanwhile I’ve nothing, as now you know,
But one small rented bungalow,
Three rooms, three pigeon-holes, and 50....
No wonder I yearn for space and air.
And empire over a nice new pair
Of populous planets at least. So there!

“Percy Pawnticket”: The queer animal
which I once heard a woman describe as
“the green-eyed lobster” gets in its bad work
in some almost unbelievable circumstances.
The fact that he had been married for 30
years and that his wife had presented him
with no less than 11 pledges of affection did
not keep the jealous twinges out of the heart
of a Victorian farmer who appeared as the
defendant in a maintenance claim the other
day. The elderly husband admitted that lie
nailed up the windows of the house to keep
out the men who might be attracted by his
mature partner’s charms, but, even then, he
was not satisfied of his security, and his dark
suspicion and even more murky accusations
led to a parting. Even this is not the limit.
Another Court recently found itself called
upon to deal with an old-age pensioner who
nursed a rankling thought that his wife,
aged 69, had an inclination to stray on the
primrose path. The raillery of the Bench
failed to convince him that his suspicions
were foolish. “I wouldn’t trust her no fur-
ther than I could see her,” he asserted
doggedly.

Flat (Q.) and Sugarland (U.S.A.) indicate
the existence of another planet inhabited
like our own. In his previous appeal to The
Bulletin he asked observers in Australia
to communicate with him if similar pheno-
omena occurred in their districts, and he
now states he has been submerged in fresh
evidence. He has over 70 records of down-
pourings of frogs, including a brown species
unknown to zoologists on this planet; also
red worms ; but none of tadpoles. This last
circumstance, he holds, disproves the theory
of prejudiced people, anxious to discounte-
nance his theory that frog-spawn is drawn
up into the clouds by evaporation. If living
things can fall from another planet on to
our own, why, he justly asks, should not

So he expresses a hope that some day a new
Columbus will set out to find this new
America in space. It seems to be as worthy
an object as flying over the Pole. He might,
for instance, come back with some informa-
tion that would explain the well-known but
mysterious habit collar-studs have of vanish-
ing without let or sign.

“Flicker”: In the Adelaide Police Court
an offender charged with “language, y’r
women police are a trifle perturbed.
’Onner, an tearin’
me uniform,” was
fined £3 10s. and
costs, and further
ordered to pay for
a new pair of
trousers for the
arresting constable.
Defendant ex-
pressed his perfect
willingness to pay
for new trousers —
“but it ain’t right
that ’e should ’ave
both pairs.” A
startled Bench in-
quired if the mis-
demeanant actually
wanted the dam-
aged garment. On
being assured that
lie did, and the
police prosecutor
offering no object-
tion, the magistrate
made the necessary
order, and the
stickler for his
dues departed with
his trophy, possibly
to hang up in his
sanctum while he
tells the saga of
its winning to
his cobbers when
they drop in for a
beer these long
evenings. But there
is a rumor that the
“The Oldest Inhabitant” goes back a year
or two:—
A comfortable and well built cottage in Bent-
street, Sydney, occupying a valuable site, is doomed
to demolition. It was built at least 100 years ago
and is associated with some historic names. In
Governor King’s time Mr. and Mrs. Francis Cox
occupied a cottage about where Bulletin-lane joins
Macquarie-place. Cox was a blacksmith and did
most of the pioneer work in that line. The pair
had a family which included three daughters. One
married William Charles Wentworth and died in
England; the second married Richard Hill ; the
third George Blandsworth, a publican of Sussex-
street, at whose house
in 1831 Francis Cox
died, aged 86. His
wife built the Bent-
street cottage and died
there October 14,
1847, aged 80. Rich-
ard Hill, M.L.C., an
old Parliamentary
hand, succeeded to the
property. Here his
•wife, Henrietta,
daughter of Francis
Cox, died, as did also
Richard Hill, aged 85.
Wentworth promised
that the Cox couple
should at death be in-
terred in the family
vault which he pur-
posed excavating at
Vaueluse, "but the
promise was not kept.
The aged couple’s re-
mains were removed
from the “Sand Hills”
to the South Head
Cemetery. I was pre-
sent at the removal.
Mention of W. C.
Wentworth brings to
mind a rumor current
50 years ago. A public
funeral was accorded
the remains of the
great Australian, and
.Tames Martin delivered
an oration over the
coffin at Vaueluse. But
it was said later on
that the great con-
course which attended
and the oration paid
honor to an empty
eoffin. The explanation was that the coffin con-
taining the remains was still deep down in the
hold of the ship which had brought it to Australia,
it having been impossible to reach it in time for
the funeral.

“X.D.”: At a Melbourne police-station
was left a photograph of a man “wanted”
in connection with a charge of failing to
maintain his son; and the other day the
lady who had left it called to get it back.
It could not be founds —which was not sur-
prising seeing that 14 years had elapsed since
it was left. Such exhibitions of sentiment
are not uncommon. A recent instance was
the call of a grey-haired woman, probably a
virulent pursuer of alimony in her time, who
tearfully said that she had driven her hus-
band from her by ill-temper, wanted to “clear
his name” and have all debts outstanding
against him wiped off, and would take it as
a special favor if they could find the old
man and assure him that she was sorry and,
now she had the old-age pension, ready to
welcome him back. It may have been some
such motive that prompted the recent applica-
tion for the photograph ; or the lady may have
wished to show it to the boy with the words
“This is your father.” On the other hand
she might have intended to say: “If ever
you see that, punch it.”
* * * *
_ “Alwyn” : If the Mosman (Sydney) Coun-
cil persists in its decision to pull down that
ancient structure, the “Old Barn,” it will
mean the severance of still another link
with the colony’s romantic past. Erected in
the ’thirties by Archibald Mosman, whose
occupation of a four-acre block at the head
of Mosman Bay for the establishment and
equipment of a whaling-station was sanc-
tioned by Governor Darling on January 1,
1831, it was utilised as a storehouse for
casked oil. In addition to the “Old Barn”
there remained at Mosman until the late
’seventies another interesting reminder of
the whaling days—an old-fashioned pair of
capstans. Though originally granted only
four acres, Mosman, who was obviously a hard-
headed business man, finally acquired no less
than 108 acres. His property in 1838 ex-
tended from the nowaday ferry-wharf right
up to the present-day shopping centre in
Military-road, at which part of Mosman the
land values now sweep up to £lOO per foot.

“Hasen”: Though the honeymoon was over
James had not yet reached the stage of lauda-
tory reminiscences of his mother’s cooking.
In fact, even in his most dispassionate
moments it seemed to him that his wife’s
efforts were pretty fair. But something
about this trifle certainly surprised him,
though he kept on doggedly until he had
finished a large helping. His face must
have betrayed him at the end, for Mrs. James
asked nervously, “Didn’t you like it, dear?”
“Oh, yes,” said James promptly and cour-
ageously, “it’s rather—a —quaint taste
sort of—I” And then Mrs. James made
her belated confession. “You see, dear,” she
said, “I was thinking about that cross-word
puzzle in the Stab. There was one word
I just couldn’t get. I was thinking and
thinking, and all of a sudden I thought of
it. And in my excitement I believe I must
have grabbed it and put it on the trifle. It
was something very hot in seven letters be-
ginning with M.” And James guessed it
easily, aided by certain rebellious writliings
ot the stomach and a memory of having heard
of mustard as an emetic.
* * * #
“Caractacus”: There is something humor-
ous, no doubt, in the information that Stone-
haven, the title chosen by the Governor-
General-elect, is pronounced “Stanehi.” It
serves to recall the Frenchman’s gibe that
the English spelt a word gutta-percha, pro-
nounced it india-rubber, but meant caout-
chouc. Australians, however, cannot afford
to laugh : they are too prone to distort their
own place-names. For instance, in one small
portion of Riverina Cookardinia is nearly
always called “Cook-an-dyna”; Bunduro
is “Bundore'; Woomargama is frequently
“Yu-marg-ya-ma”; Eunonyhareenyah (im-
mortalised by “Banjo” Paterson) is “Ron-
a-reeny”; Murraguldrie is “Maria Guidry,”
and beautiful Ourania is “Orny.” Doubtless
there are hundreds other such mispronuncia-
tions throughout the Commonwealth. If
names may so change within a hundred years
in a nation which has had compulsory free
education for half of the time, what will have
happened to our Tangambalangas and Eeneu-
namaramangs when they have been in use as
long as Stonehaven? Even now many call
Melbourne and Brisbane “Melb’n’ ” and
“Brisb’n’,” giving the “n” only the faintest
sound.
* * * *
“Yang”: German-sounding names were too
frequent to attract much notice in the
A.1.F., but British names among the Huns
were rare and must have been less popular.
We were surprised therefore to learn from
captured orders that the Bavarian trenches
opposite us held a lieutenant with the fine
old Teutonic handle of Albert Smith. And
it would have been such an easy transition to
Albrecht Schmidt.
* * * *
“Verri”: Binks, who lives next door to
me, has always been rather casual in his
treatment of his missus, and his brother-in-
law spoke to him about it the other day.
He pointed out to Binks that his wife was
a splendid but unappreciated woman, and
suggested that a little chivalrous attention
now and again would not be out of place.
Binks, who is rather impressionable, con-
fided to me his intention of taking the advice
to heart, and bought a box of chocolates
wherewith to make the first advances. It
really had nothing to do with me, but I
decided to clip the hedge outside the Binks
kitchen and watch how the performance went
off. Binks, with the air of a frolicsome
lad, leapt up the back steps and into the
DIRTY WORK.
“Gracious, child, how did you get your
hands so filthy?”
“Washing me face.”

the sound of weeping. Mrs. Binks’s voice
floated clearly over the hedge. “As if I
hadn’t enough to bear without this,” she
wept. . “Jimmy cut his foot to-day and I’ve
had him to the doctor, and the line broke
and let the clothes down in the mud, and
Beggy turned on the batli-tap and the water

It has been a great year for the wool houses:
favorable weather resulted in a heavy yield
of splendid staple, and prices reached heights
which spelled luscious returns for the squat-
ter and the selling agents alike. At the hrst
series in Sydney the average price per hale
was £37 18s. 7d.—£o 14s. 4d. above that of
the previous season. In the November sales
the average rose to £39 10s. 9d. So opulent
have been the returns that the directors were
moved to the following comment: —
The wool season of 1924-25 will rank as the
most remarkable to date. At the opening in Sep-
tember, in Sydney, an excited demand was met, with
rising values until November. In that month lecoid
prices were paid, greasy merino fleece realising to
58M., comeback 50id., lambs 48-id., crossbred 4o- 4 d.
Prices slackened in December, although compara-
tively extreme rates were still forthcoming until
closing of the series in that month. At resumption
in January it was evident that the demand lacked
the vigor of previous sales, and a continuous slide
was experienced until April. Buying power then
had become so depleted that it was deemed wise to
suspend sales until July 1, with the proviso that
auctions would be resumed about that date it con-
ditions so warranted.
Although it is estimated that up to the end
of the statistical year on June 30 there will be
about 500,000 bales of the clip unsold—approxi-
mately one-quarter of the total —it is remarkable that
the portion already sold has realised about.
£52,500,000, which is within a million pounds ot
the total received in the whole of any previous yeai s
sales in Australia, and about £5,750,000 m excess
of the total result in any year during the war
[Bipraisement period.
As one of Australia’s great wool houses,
Goldsbrough-Mort shared in the feast, and
made new records in all directions.
The disclosed profit for the year was
£320,207. less bonus to staff (£6240) and
£5OOO for the provident fund. This com-
pares with the figures for recent years like
this:— D .

But that figure, handsome though it is, is only
part of what was won. The r ®Berve fund
expanded from £432.500 to £J09,560 a
matter of over half a million. New share
premiums account for £186,113 of the figure;
in the rest is doubtless hidden a large amount
of profit won from commission business and
the co.’s own properties. And on top even
of that there was plainly a large provision
for depreciation : there is, for instance,_ a
hefty internal reserve in the figure to which
premises have been written down. In ere
were other factors helping the wonderful
clip and prices to produce these extraor-
dinary results. Three years ago the busi-
ness of Harrison, Jones and Devlin (Sydney)
was bought, and last year that of Bagot,
Shakes and Lewis (S.A.). The latter was
taken over as from April 1, 1924, and thus
the latest accounts express the results of
the amalgamation for the full twelvemonths.
To finance the purchase capital was increased
from £966.849 to £1,500 000. The purchase
consideration was 285,000 G.-M. £1 shares.
Bagot, Shakes and Lewis shareholders re-
ceived two for every five held in the old co.,
which absorbed 280,000; the remaining 5000
shares were disposed of to cover the costs
of liquidation and to pay a bonus for long-
ES was’offered to'G.-M.'Xwhoffl^
a premium of 15s. per share. At that puce
the 15 p.c. div. would be worth about 82 p. .
Inevitably big changes have occurred in

The £850,855 of “A” debenture stock and the
£584 823 of “B” stock represent old debt-

of the late ’eighties. Since 1905 A s have

primary reserve of £100,OCX) is a guarantee
that the interest will be paid, although hold*
ers long since lost any anxiety on that score
A secondary reserve of £75,000 is a kind of
reinforcement. That cheap money has been
a tremendous advantage, and ot even greater
value to a co. in this line of business is the
fixed nature of the investment. Ut liabili-
ties the chief increase last year was in
amounts owing on open account, which went
from £215,658 to £650,232. Deposits also
increased. Advances bounded up by over
14 million. But, then, for 1924 the unsold
balance of wool was 3592 bales, whereas last
year 59,654 had to be carried over, ihat
naturally called for advances, and that and
general expansion moved the directors to pro-
pose a further increase in capital to
£1,750,000 by the issue of a quarter-million
of new shares —an increase of almost a
million in five years —to be offered to share-
holders at 355. in proportion of one for every
six held. . ... ■
The co. is applying to the Courts for per-
mission to alter its articles in various re-
spects, chief being to permit it to do insur-
ance business: it wants to keep some of those
profits, too, in the business.

That capitalisation is equal to a one-in-six
gift, and makes the return over the past four
years very sweet; and last years 12 p.c.
was worth almost two points more because
of the one-in-seven gift issue of two years
ago. Further, although 1919 and ’2O were
lean years owing to droughty conditions, the
20 p.c. of the two subsequent terms removed
any feeling of bitterness. Certainly in order
to v make these gifts, visible reserves have
been reduced to £306. But internal re-
serves are substantial, various assets being
taken into the books at most conservative
valuations. ....
Bingera’s part in last season’s record
sugar-production was a crushing or 119,5-0
tons accompanied by other records in weekly
output and sugar-recovery due to plant im-
provements made during the year. 4he
price of raw sugar at £26 was £1 per ton
lower than it was in 1923 and £4 6s. Bd.
lower than in the three seasons preceding.
Owing to the further surplus anticipated for
the current season the price will again show
a reduction, probably substantial. But the
renewal of the embargo on importations _ot
foreign sugar by the Federal Government in-
sures stability' to the industry for three
years from August 31 next, aud that, as iai
as it goes, offsets all other deficiencies. But
three years will soon pass; and what then t
These and other people interested m sugar
have the great advantage of being in the
same industry as the tremendously powerful
C.S.R., whose success in turning threaten-
ing danger into good commands this Column s
admiration. But in these allegedly demo-
cratic days that isn’t a very safe reed to
depend upon : some day big profits and Ire-
quent bonuses may lead to very unpleasant
legislation. And this isn’t a case where
something radical need be done. It will be
enough if the present support is withdrawn
or modified. This is a contingency that has
to be kept in mind in valuing such shares as
these. .....

How long will the demand for cars continue
in its present volume? Each of the past
three years has moved to greater figures with
almost every big automobile distributing
house in Australia, and there is no discern-
ible break in the demand —it is still increas-
ing. New makes are flooding the market,
and that is a factor which will operate with
unkind force when the present demand-
much of it artificial —eases off and rational
requirements only have to be met. Mean-
time some motor firms are working i up to
and even beyond shipments, with results that
show in hefty profit figures. Garratts last
year did record business which is reflected
in a record profit, equal to over o 5 p.c. on
ord. capital after providing for the prets., ot
which £lOO.OOO 10 per cents, were issued
early in the term. The old prefs (£lOOO b

The bank overdraft was reduced by £29,692

liabilities of f 233,123 represent about 19

£8409- book debts account for no less than
£259 540 compared with £86,002 of the pre-
vious year. Nearly all of that increase re-
presents t.-p. sales; but the form of the
agreement and the limitation of the purchase
period to twelve months cut down the risks to
small proportions. All things considered
then, the balance-sheet position is sound
without being attractive. . To represent
£223.123 of liabilities there were on January
31 £365,784 of more or less liquid assets,
with freeholds and plant in the books at

£2 4s. 2d. for each fully-paid share. Although
the year’s profits were large the cost oi
raising the prefs was written off-and the
ordinary div. rate left unchanged «tlO l - -;
the balance going to reserves. This after
stock had been valued “very conservatively
and “ample provision made for all known
contingencies and depreciation _ of _ wasting
assets.” If that policy is maintained and
reserves built up the co. will be in a better
position to meet any slackening or slump.

This co. has made a nice, steady profit out
of the resuscitation of the apparently
drowned. In 1907 it took over the Freehold
Assets Realisation Co. which was burying
the Freehold, Investment and Banking Co.,
formed in 1882 and suspended in ’92 with
liabilities of about £1,300,000. It also owns
almost all the shares in the Land Mortgage
Bank —and incidentally has breathed life
into its dry bones. Profits have increased
of recent years and the past year’s 15 p.c.
div. does not crowd them. Reserves total
£51,187, mostly utilised in the general activi-
ties of the co. But here is the position:—

The co.’s existence and progress is bound up
in the real estate market. If present values
hold and sales are maintained there will be
little difficulty in providing the 15 p.c.; but
even though properties are in the books at a
written-down value a slump would hit the
co. as well as its offsider, the Land Mortgage
Bank.

The profit shrank because less came from the
co.’s holding in General Films. But that has
been the cause of most of the. variations in
the first column of the table, divs. from that
source having been very erratic. However,
since the reconstruction of the co. in 1913
out of the old West’s Pictures, Ltd., share-
holders have received an average of 9? p.c.
—a decent return over a period of IB years.
Further, in that time £28,249 of profits have
accumulated. (These reserves are exclusive
of the so-called Capital Reserve, which was
the amount by which the co. discounted the
face-value of the holding in General hums.)
A further source of income is the co. s own
theatres; apparently, though no figures are
available, the return from these assets is
steady. There has been little change m re-
cent balance-sheet figures: —

The diminishing profits tell of the march
of concrete and the slackening in suburban
building activity in Melbourne. And the
outlook is still uncertain. Not that share-
holders should be surprised at variation in
divs., for that has been characteristic for the
past 15 years. Last year’s earnings were
assisted by economies in working, labor-
saving machinery having been installed. But
that did not suffice to counterbalance the
slackening in trade, which showed in a reduc-
tion of gross profits from £27,630 to £19,861
—almost 30 p.e. On March 31 liabilities
were £2759. Cash, free and on deposit,
amounted to £11,916, and there were besides
£5200 in Commonwealth stock, £7335 book
debts and £132,092 in property, plant and
other assets. Shares in other cos. were
valued at £36,361, 9646 bonus shares having
been received from other cos. during the
year, and the paid-up value of the shares
carried direct to reserve. No provision was
made out of the year’s profits for deprecia-
tion, but the allowances of other years was
probably in excess of requirements. Although
the co.’s position is apparently quite sound,
prospects are governed by building activity
in Melbourne, and no renewal of the brisk-
ness is visible at the moment.

Mt. Spencer Silver, Copper and Lead Min-
ing Co. is a Melbourne float in £160,000 it
shares, for which the vendor asks 40,000
fully-paids and £3500 cash. The old mining
properties which it is proposed to work are
the Pine Vale copper-mine, the Mt. Spencer
or Tally Ho silver-lead mine, and Mt. Barker,
also silver-lead, situated on the Mackay
hinterland (Q.). As to the Tally Ho, both
W. E. Cameron and Dr. Marks, reporting
a few years back, spoke rather favorably of
it. Of Pine Vale copper, L. C. Ball said
that the lode was 2ft. 3in. wide, about lb
inches of it good ore, and that with further
development and careful management
mechanically concentrated ore from the adit
could be produced at a profit. Mt. Barker
was reported on by the late It. L. Jack many
years ago in favorable but vague terms. He
saw the workings to 85ft. deep, but did not
give any prospective tonnage of ore to that
depth. His report quotas numerous rich assays,
but the text shows that these came from
galena veins varying from a few inches to
18 inches thick. The present prospectus is
accompanied by a very glowing report by
H. M. Thompson as to the value of the mines.
The merit of this report can be judged per-
haps from this statement re Mt. Spencer :
“That the mine is a very valuable one. is
shown from the fact that the metal yield
from one trial shipment of 84 tons gave
14oz. gold, 4200 z. silver and 18.75 cwt. of
lead, total value £l2O 95.”; also that “on
sinking the lodes will open out in width
and increase in value.” What is conspicu-
ously lacking are facts that would lead him
to this latter opinion, and also any evidence
of his own sampling of the prospective ore or
references to work done by the vendors. If
no recent work has been done by the vendors
to inspect and sample the workings, then the
wad of £3500 cash and 40,000 p.u. is highly
disproportionate to the expense of taking
these areas up and paying for a mining re-
port. The inaccessibility of Mt. Barker is
hurdled over by the statement that “at low
cost a road 10 miles long could be made prac-
ticable for motor traffic.” It is in reality
exceedingly rough and rangy country. This
item only helps to bring out the fact that
there is no actual basis shown in the pros-
pectus for the proposed capitalisation of
£160,000. Rather than take three mixed pro-
positions together it would probably be much
safer to tackle the most promising one alone
on a smaller capital. It is certainly to be
hoped that the statements in the prospectus
are more accurate than the map accompany-
ing it, which shows Mt. Barker miles from
its correct position and in the wrong direc-
tion from the railway terminus.
* * * *
Gympie mining is quiet. No. 4 North
Phoenix is turning out very little ore, and
the stopes around the 784 ft. level are almost
depleted. A crushing of 48 tons last week
yielded 160 oz. The Lucknow has a reef 2ft.
to 3ft. thick at the 78ft. level, and it is being
driven on, but at present tlie face looks
hungry, and a few plumbago partings would
brighten it up and probably bring in the
gold. The New Nicholls Syndicate on the
Glamire reef is putting through a trial
crushing at the Monkland battery.
* * * #
In the Duke shaft of the Ravenswood
(N.Q.) the co. is driving on the reef at No. 6
level, but it is still small, and the rich shoot
worked in No. 5 has not been found yet. In
No. 5 there is not much width of it, but how
good it is may be judged from the last crush-
ing—47 tons gave 5610 z. amalgam, and con-
centrates are very rich.
* * * *
Sardine Tin Mines, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.),
reports 18 inches of 20 p.c. ore in the No. 3
north level for a distance of 14ft., making
altogether 38ft. along the level on the shoot.
The last crushing of 92 tons gave 8 tons
15cwt. of concentrates.
Mt. Cuthbert goes into the hands of Bertie
Hill and the Mt. Elliott crowd. That was
to be expected, failing amalgamation of the
llampden-Clon curry and Mt. Elliott, as
wanted by William Orr. His plan failed
because Collins House would not stand domi-
nance by London. Now that a railway to
Mt. Isa seems settled, Hampden may get rid
of its smeltery to the leadfield, which may
buy it at scrap valuation. Mt. Elliott then
will be left in possession of the Cloncurry
copper region, so that in the end W. 11. Cor-
bould's dream of one big copper organisation
for Northern Queensland may materialise.
Brandeis Goldschmidt, the metal dealers,
bought Cuthbert from the Commonwealth
Bank for an old song. Now its works and
mine may become, as Ttte Bulletin long
since suggested was possible, the centre for
Mt. Oxide, Mt. Elliott and all the copper
outliers of the field. French money is largely
sunk in Mt. Elliott. With the franc m
full flight the moment may also have arrived
to get the cash needed for joining up the
Oxide and Cuthbert. Mining can be stai'ted
at Cuthbert very cheaply, "which is probably
why Hill relieves Brandeis Goldschmidt of
the property.
Arthur Moore, a Queensland driller, has
called attention to one potential source of
oil: the natural gas which exists in numer-
ous artesian wells in Queensland and N. S.
Wales. In 1923 the United States recovered
816 million gallons of petrol from natural
gas derived from wells, and from the same
source manufactured 138 million pounds
of carbon black worth £2,ddS,oOO. In Aus-
tralia not a single plant is at work extract-
ing petrol from natural gas, although there
are thousands of such plants working in the
United States. They are not costly to build
and the process is simple. The gas from
the Roma (Q.) wells contains 1.22 pints of
iietrol per 1000 cubic feet of gas. At 2s. 3d.
per gallon for petrol, these 1.22 pints are
worth 4d. The flow of gas at Roma ran
into millions of cubic feet per day. One
million cubic feet at 4d. per 1000 c. feet
is worth £l6 135., so there is money m the
business. Seeps of natural gas have been
reported in all the six States, and not a
commercial test has been made of one ot them.
* * * *
The Queensland gold yield for May was
5839 fine oz., compared with 7135 fine oz.
for May, 1924; and Mt. Morgan produced
53320 z. of the total, which shows how dead
this branch of the mining industry is else-
where in Queensland at present. Gympie
is a back number; and of the newer fields
that promised some hope, Mt. Coolon is
awaiting development, and Normanby, the
Oaks and Woolgar are duds. The leeway
for the first five months of 1925 as compared
with last year is 13,252 fine oz.—say,
£56,291.

The recent Federal Geological Congress
in Melbourne decided to inform the Govern-
ment that the reward of £50,000 for the dis-
covery of payable mineral oil was useless,
and that the most efficient method of ass'st-
ing was by systematic geological survey. Ihe
conference admitted that oil had on many
occasions been found in America and else,-
where by luck pure and simple, but insisted
that the huge expenditure by oil interests m
elaborate and refined geological and topo-
graphical surveys left no doubt as to wii.it
those who were most directly concerned v\
the subject thought about it. The great
Signal Hill discovery was a notable instance
where there were no superficial indications
of oil, but the geological work, lasting some
years, on this area reaped a rich reward.
The discussion brought out the fact that
there was too much blind stabbing going on
in Australia on the diagnosis of unqualified
men as to what were probable oil-bearing
areas and formations, and that the private
capitalists’ purse was being depleted on
mostly useless work. Also that many who
were connected with oil flotations were, not
so much interested in the finding of oil as
in what could be made out of engineering the
search for it.

Paringa made a profit of £3041 last year
against a loss of £1879 in the previous 12
months. The co.’s present assets include a
mine at Kalgoorlie, an interest “worth
£5000” in a Rhodesian “golden quarry,”
an option on a share in a . Bolivian
rubber-trading co., and . shares in “good
dividend-paying South African mines” valued
at £7OOO, so shareholders can’t complain on
the score of variety. At the annual meeting
held in London last month, chairman Parker
said that the co. was in a position to do
well, but since then exemption has been
obtained on the Kalgoorlie mine on the plea
that it can’t at present be worked at a
profit, and news has come to hand that the
“golden quarry” isn’t looking so golden.

Lake View and Star (W.A.) has just en-
larged its mill and broadcasts the asser-
tion that ore treated is about to be
increased from 7000 to 15,000 tons a month.
The co. is preparing to resume operations
at depth in the old Boulder Deep Levels
lease, which for some years has formed part
of its holdings. This show marks the most
southerly point on the Kalgoorlie-Bouldei
field where ore of payable grade lias been
mined in quantity. Down to 900 ft. it was
practically unpayable, but at this depth a
payable shoot of fair length was opened up.
.-eeper the lodes are very wide and are
said to contain patches of sufficient size to
provide a fair share of the ore required for
the Lake and Star plant.
* * * *
An osmiridium find is again reported in
the Speck, this time to the south of The
Thumbs, which is alongside the upper reaches
of the well-known Gordon River. Though
the field is only 22 miles from Fitzgerald,
the terminus of the Derwent Valley rail-
way line, the going is hard. There is a
rough track most of the way. several
stretches of which are made of corduroy—•
painful to walk over with any great load.
Prospectors have to carry their own food
and gear all the way from the railway. The
Government proposes to make a pack-track
to encourage further search.
Away along the. ridge on which the Junc-
tion North and North Broken Hill perch lies
No. 3 Block. As it was beyond the big fault
plotted by geologist Andrews. George Weir,
general manager of the North, let the lease
•alone: but a Melbourne crowd decided to
have a go at it. They kicked off by finding
a patch of sulphides. So they moved a little
west and put down an incline bore which
bisected a shoot of ore wide at the
shallow depth of 75ft. Next, taking their
stand above the sulphides at the surface, a
vertical bore was sent down to over 400 ft.
It has hit sulphides and kept in them for
100 ft. What formation they belong to and
whence they come is what has to be proved.
A vertical drill entering a ruD of galena
would be likely to keep in the soft ore even
if it meant deflection to follow a narrow
seam. So the most to be said of Block 3
is that the crowd has got some ore. Its
extent can only be settled by sinking or by
fan-boring at an incline. The country Block
3 way has always been looked at askance.
Even the Victoria Cross lease, in which a
big slab of the North Broken mine now'
nestles, was picked up for a mere song by
A. E. Clarke and clung to by him until weak-
hearted shareholders let the North gobble it
up. What a prize was missed, just as the
South at the other end, though not so cheaply,
let slip its two South Blocks to 8., M. and
Co. Most of the solid prospecting ahead of
the North lease was done across the gully, at
or beyond Round Hill, on the top of which
to this day specimens of chlorides can be
picked up. The Great Northern’s fossick-
ing on Block 3 in itself is a plucky go even
if on a minor schlc. But better that than
nothing.

Manager Stone, of Sutherland Lode,
Kiandra (N.S.W.), has issued a report to
shareholders intimating that the show has
retired to winter quarters. The reef in-
creased in size from 12in. at the surface to
4ft. at 78ft., where a 6oz. Bdwt. assay was
developed. A westerly dip has carried the
lode half out of the shaft at 100 ft., but the
footwall portion is 2ft. wide, half being
highly mineralised. At this depth the clean
ouartz assays Bdw r t. and the mineralised ore
9oz. 14dwt.
After all. Tongkah Compound isn’t to see
tlie last of Thompsons’ suction dredge, as
it can remain at work till December 1. Per-
haps then if it functions properly it will
become a fixture. The directors realise that
Thompsons have played the game over the
plant, and they don’t want to force it on
to the scrapheap if it can be got. into trim.
Ilex Thompson is certain it will come out
Jill right, and his firm will alter the dredge
at its own expense. If Thompsons win
through, the dredge will be accepted in dis-
charge of the firm’s liability. Any tin won
goes to the Compound, but out of the pro-
ceeds of its sale operating costs will be
allowed. If it doesn’t win sufficient, to do
that Thompsons will make up the cash short-
age. Also, if the dredge doesn’t, succeed by
December 1 they will return the co. pay-
ments received on account. So it. is a fair
go all round. The market sniffed at the
early word that an agreement was in the
air, but generally settled down to the opinion
that the best tiling possible had been done.
Good old John Bull, despite hard-uppish-
ness, is still prepared for a flutter in oil.
So A. O. Capell, who nursed the Bux Co.’s
interests while R. M. Boyd fossicked around
Borneo, is playing up to him in the hope
that 50 thousand in cash or shares will be
sent to Melbourne. The properties offered
to John are the 2 and 5 blocks selected by
Boyd and reported on cheerfully by geolo-
gist Lyne. Bux gave Capell an option on
a £lOO 000 basis for the 2-5 blocks, but.
although it isn’t quite clear it looks as if that
sum has had to be cut in halves. The intention
is to also hand the 6 and 7 blocks to Jno.
Bull as burley if he opens his pockets wide
enough. Should he be tempted Bux will
hold its original No. 1 concession for come-
and-go purposes, while J. Bull bores the
other blocks. Capell must, however, hustle,
as the Dutch East Indies authorities are
restive because, not only has no work been
done by Bux, but no cash has been placed
in the Hollander till.

Nawng Pet (F.M.S.) has progressed back-
wards during recent months, and another
change in leadership is being effected on
this mine. The May return of 7f tons from
1910 cubic yards was the result of straight-
ening the faces, and in other ways making
ready for a further term of real work. The
7f tons cost £5OO, or nearly as much as
the ordinary run.
Tongkah Harbor, Siam, recovered 46 tons
oxide from 290,000 yards during May. The
chief contributor was the new ground at
Clielong Bay. which is now supplying a
regular eight tons a week.
* * * *
Thomo has changed its coat. When formed
it was to dig out buckets of gold at Thomo,
Siam ; but the show did not yield up to re-
ports. and was rejected after a pretty penny
had been spent in testing it. That act has
the endorsement of the other lot of option-
holders who followed Thomo. Then good
old Ivhaw .Too Toll came to light as operating
agent for Thomo. Under his expert eye the
co. has been on the hunt for a tin-show. Six
offerings have been turned down, and as the
examinations cost money the next step is
reconstruction. The co. now is in SOO shares
of £25 each. The new is to have £150,000
in £1 shares, of which 20,000 fully-paids arc
to go to Tliomo shareholders for assets and
liabilities. Then 80,000 shares (contribs.
paid to 2s. each) are to be issued to the same
shareholders, the balance of 50,000 shares
being held in reserve. By that arrange-
ment each Tliomo carries 25 fully-paids and
1(K) cons. The Board recently applied for
and was allotted 25,000 contribs. in a Burmuh
tin-show—Pulo, at Lampi Island, in the
Mergui district. These shares are to be
part of the assets that fall to the new co.
As the Pulo is of the no-liability type little
risk is run in the spec., whatever its future
may be.

Septimus Miller, who took the “big jump”
recently at the age of 75, was well known
throughout Australia as a breeder and race-
horse-owner—his name will long be con-
nected with Redleap. He had a partiality
for jumpers, gained while chasing Reynard
with the Findon Harriers. For the last 40
years he had during leisure moments occu-
pied a seat on the V.R.C. committee, and
was responsible for the establishment of the
richly-endowed Cantala Stakes. Though
never in politics himself, he closely followed the
doings of two who wielded some influence in
Parliament in the last 40 years. His brother
Edward, holder ot' a knighthood, was in the
Vic. Dreary House from 1893 till 1913. His
brother-in-law, Henry Wrixon, after figur-
ing conspicuously in the Assembly as Attor-
ney-General in the Gillies-Deakin Coalition
(1886-90), became President of the TJppah
Chambah (1901-10). Of course Sep’s father,
“Money” Miller, was also in the House of
Landlords for 10 years after responsible
government was established (1856-66), but
that is long ago.
The widow of Australia’s first Chief .Jus-
tice, Samuel Walker Griffith, lias just died
in Brisbane. The grand old lady had out-
stayed her partner in life bv five years: she
died at 78. Maitland (N.S.W.) knew her in
her youth as Julia Janet Thomson.
Maoriland’s new Solicitor-General, Arthur
Fair, is a young man with a habit of crowd-
ing 365 days into a year. A west-coast boy,
he hustled through
his books, taking
his LL.B. and be-
ing admitted as a
barrister at 21. He
was on holiday in
England when the
war came, and an-
nexed the M.C. in
Palestine before re-
turning home. He
was Crown Solici-
tor and Principal
Law Officer before
he got the big ap-
pointment.

Crawford Vaughan writes:—
The last time I saw Amundsen was when he asked
me to lunch with him at the Recess Club, New York,
in 1918. He was in America for the purpose of
addressing Norwegians engaged in shipyards and
munition plants with a view to speeding up war
productions. I was on the same work in relation
to Britishers. He was a man who didn’t let a
trifle stop him. He told me he had once been
booked on a wrong train by the American Publicity
Department. Discovering the mistake shortly after
he tram had started out of New York, ho pulled
I lie communication cord, and. when the train stopped
", a jerk he got out with his modest handbag
and walked batk to the Grand Central. The train
officials made no complaint, evidently considering
hat the discoverer of the South Pole was entitled
0 P"* l cvcll tlie Twentieth Century Limited if
! ' elt like it. Amundsen was so dissatisfied, by the
way, with the publicity arrangements made at Wash-
ington that he made up his mind to take the first
ship back to Norway and there inaugurate an
expedition to the North Pole. But it took him
seven years to develop the project.

at Ravensthorpe
(W.A.). Starting-
in the late ’eighties

LANG, the new
Premier of N.S.W.
Though modern M.L. Premiers last long
there are four ex-Premiers still living. All
are knights-—Robert Stout, 11 all-Jones, Joe
Ward and Thomas Mackenzie.
Old Parliamentary hands recalled that
James Munro, when Vic. Opposition leader,
disconcerted the Gillies-Deakin Coalition in
the same way as Matt Charlton did the
Bruce-Page team last week by declining to
discuss the Address-in-Reply. Vic. Assembly
then occupied the chamber now used by the
Reps., and Munro sat in the place where
Charlton is now located. It was Munro who
broke up the Great Coalition in 1890, and
formed a Ministry which afterwards sup-
plied Premiers for years—Shiels, Turner,
McLean and Peacock.
Frank Clarke, who is to get another term
as President of Victoria’s Plush House, is
the , eighth holder of the office in the last 69
years. Of his seven predecessors only Mani-
fold survives. Bowser is the 13th Speaker
of the Assembly, and the other 12 are all
under the sod. Allan, who is the 29th Pre-
mier, is cheered with the knowledge that
six of the 28 who blazed the track for him
are still above ground—Peacock (State Trea-
surer), Irvine (State C.J.). Watt (Speaker
of Reps.), Bowser (Speaker of Assembly),
Lawson. M.L.A., and Prendergast (Labor-
Opposition leader).
James Murdoch, Tasmanian M.L.C., who
died at 74 the other day, was the head of the
numerous Murdoch clan, descendants of an
old James Murdoch who came to the Speck
in 1822. Starting life in the flour-milling
business, James, junior, abandoned this for
orcharding, and his Craigow estate is row the
largest privately-owned orchard in Tasmania.
Besides serving for 22 years continuously in
the Leg. Council, he had held just about every
local public position, from special magistrate
under the Old Age Pension Act to warden
of the local municipality of Clarence.
“A.M..T.”: The recent death in Cue
(W.A.) of Billy Phillips has removed a
pioneer from the Westralian goldfields.
Phillips was a member of that ill-fated Gov-
ernment-equipped expedition which Steve
Grace led in search of gold. Leaving WTluna,
the expedition proceeded uorth along the
cattle-track, but one dawn the barking of
the camp-dog aroused Grace a second before
the native who was towering over him
pinned him to the ground with a spear-thrust
which a few days later resulted in his death.
As he lay dying, in the arms of Bill Kirk-
patrick, Grace’s words were: “Gold! Why,
it's all gold!” Andre Hayward’s poem with
this title is well beloved of all goldfielders.
Of the whole expedition. Bill Kirkpatrick,
now of Mt. Gray station, is the sole survivor.
“T. 0.1.”: Cuthbert Fetherstonbaugh, dead
at. 88, was a son of Cuthbert Fetherston-
liaugh. for 40 years a police magistrate, in
Victoria. In the later ’fifties few men were
better known or more popular than lie. He
could sit a buckjumper, ride in a steeple-
chase or handle a team of half-broken colts
with any man. It was said that every bone
in his body except his neck had been frac-
tured at. one time or other, llis method of
breaking in young horses was simplicity it-
self. lie simply let the team of four go,
while he sat firmly, guiding them as best lie
could across the rolling downs of Muntham
Estate, of which he was manager. The coun-
try was unfenced in those days, so that he
and his horses could take any line they
chose. The pace could not last, but it was
the horses and not the driver that gave in
first. Since those days Cuthbert Fetherston-
haugh had been many things—parson, squat-
ter. explorer and mining prospector.
Steve Boreham, Labor agitator and man
of a romantic past, has just been buried with
the lamentations of all Dunedin, which he
helped to keep amused for many years. He
worked hard for Labor and received little
thanks. Yet he did some fine work for it:
bis advocacy resulted, for instance, in an
Act for providing for better accommodation
for shearers. In his young days, when abroad,
he joined up with a S. American warship and
took part in a revolution. And in his time
he had travelled with a circus, too.
In Ballarat’s golden days Morgan Llewel-
lyn, just dead at 87, managed the Victoria
United mine, and was reputed to have been
the discoverer of the fabulously rich Indi-
cator line of reef.
The distinction of being the first to be
reduced to ashes in the new crematorium at
Rookwood (N.S.W.) belongs to Annie Sil-
cocks, the wife of a railway permanent-way
inspector.
Fifty years ago there was a schism at
pioneer Christ Church, Geelong. A number
of Anglican “first families” revolted from
allegiance to Bishop Perry, and started what
they called the Free Church of England.
They built a substantial stone tabernacle,
and installed an English organ, with Henry
Byron Moore, who has just retired from the
secretaryship of the V.R.C., as organist. The
property was sold recently and the proceeds
given to the local hospital. The trust deed
provided that in no circumstances must its
funds revert to the Church of England.
Ex-constable Cornelius Durack, who died
the other day, was one of the last of the old
policemen from Ireland installed in Vic-
toria’s early days; he was stationed at
dunes during the anti-Chinese riots of the
roaring days. He retired nearly 50 years
ago to go on the land at Telangatuk, on the
Upper Glenelg. and lived on his farm till
the end, which came at 90.
Australia lost a friend in .Tames Wignall,
Labor M.P. for the Forest of Dean, who died
suddenly in England last week after urging
his party to support the preference clauses
of Churchill’s Budget. Wignall, an elderly
union organiser, visited Australia two years
ago, liked what he saw of the country, and
said so. One of his three sons is on the
land in Westralia.
The late Monsignor O’Hea, of Coburg
(Melbourne), well remembered as a blend of
church dignitary and shrewd investor, with
a soft heart or a hard fist as became the
occasion, is now represented in another
place by grand-nephew Reginald, who re-
cently received unholy orders as a League
umpire. Three desperately-close matches in
succession without a player needing carpet-
ing supply evidence that this young O’Hea
—he is only 26 —also has the knack of con-
vincing the sinner of his error.
The widow of Charles Burney Young.
8. Aus. pastoralist and legislator who died
in 1904, has just passed away at Adelaide.
She was born in Kent (Eng.) in 1885, and
was a daughter of General Anthony Bacon,
Wellington’s youngest staff-ottieer at Water-
loo, and of his wife, Lady Charlotte Bacon,
the “lanthe” to whom in her eleventh year
the poet Byron dedicated his “Childe
Harold.” Lady Charlotte, who resided in
S. Aus. for many years, was a sister of
Alfred Harley, the last of the Earls of
Oxford of the second line, which became
extinct in 1553.
Dr. “Billy” Maloney, who will be 71 years
old this year, has a first-hand knowledge of
many things. In his early life he vaulted a
bank counter to take up a selection in the
Brandy Creek district in Gippsland. That
experience showed him what was one of the
country’s crying needs, and he went back
to the Colonial Bank and utilised his spare
time to matriculate. He was 26 when lie
went to London to study medicine, and there-
after he travelled Europe, blending surgical
studies with art, dissecting frogs and invent-
mg a method of decoration which earned the
appreciation of Ruskin and August Racinet.
(Seven years later he was M.O. on the railway
works at Albany; but soon afterwards he got
back to Melbourne and started to practise in
the street in which he was born. His definite
democratic views got him into Parliament,
and in Parliament, State or Federal, lie has
been ever since—a clear run of 36 years.
When Monsignor Mahoney died the other
day, at 68, Maoriland lost its first native-
born priest. Born in Auckland, where his
father designed many big buildings, he was
educated in Eng-
land at Oscutt Col-
lege, and received
li i s ecclesiastical
training in Bel-
gium and France.
Forty-four years
ago he was or-
dained. and with
but a brief spell of
four years on the
English Mission,
he had been con-
nected with Auck-
land ever since.

for a long time to St. Patrick's College. Mel-
bourne, but for the past ten years was on
the staff of St. Ignatius’, Riverview
(N.S.W.). Hundreds of his former scholars
remember him with enthusiasm —he could
have gained the affection of even Macaulay’s
schoolboy.
Ernest Alfred Tolley has just died in
Adelaide at 62. Of one of the city’s best-known
families, he had a large share in building
up the Tolley, Scott and Tolley wine-and-
spirit firm which has made its initials
familiar on labels all over Australia. In
private life he was one of S.A.’s very few
keen anglers.
The re-election of George Waite as assist-
ant-secretary of the United Laborers’ Union
(Sydney) was a victory of pink unionism
over the Reds. “Old George,” whose husky
voice has clamored for the rights of the
people for 40 or 50 years, was opposed by
Comrade White, who had the sympathy of
all the militants. Officials of the Seamen’s
Union were out against him, as he never
tires of denouncing Admiral Johanson, Tom
Walsh, the quaint Bill Casey and blustering
Tom Fleming. Waite has a grievance against
the seamen : whenever they go on strike or
refuse to man a ship they get jobs as laborers
without the preliminary of joining the
Laborers’ Union. The Municipal Employees’
Union is against him, too, because he pro-
mised reprisals if Aid. Glasgow (a member
of the City Council who has been appointed
as organiser of the Municipal Employees'
Union) did not cease trying to enrol Waite’s
members in his own organisation. Even the
A.W.TJ. lent a hand here and there in favor
of Waite’s opponent, because Waite has
always objected to the United Laborers be-
ing swallowed by the A.W.U. But in spite
of it all “old George” was re-elected by a
2 to 1 majority.

THe Wentworth
Sydney’s Leading' Residential Hotel
The views of the palatial additions to the Wentworth Hotel. Sydney, portrayed on this page serve as a reminder to we Sydney folk
of the growth of our city in recent years.
The Wentworth (which derives its name from the famous statesman-explorer William Charles Wentworth) is ideally situated on what
is perhaps the city’s most historical elevation—Church Hill—without the roar and bustle of a big city and withal a bare 2 minutes from the G.P.O.
The Governing Director, Mrs. Maclurcan, to whom the Wentworth owes its existence, is perhaps one of Sydney’s best-known women,
and it is to her wonderful personality and ability that the present high efficiency of Sydney’s leading residential hotel is due.
The best test of a thorough organisation is, however, the price at which the concern can profitably retail its wares; in America (popularly
believed to be the home of organisation) service and environs to equal the Wentworth would cost not less than twenty dollars a day: at the
Wentworth the inclusive tariff ranges from 25/-, a comparison which should indeed make us proud of our city.

ABORIGINAHTIES

“X2X”: A characteristic feature of the
Australian aboriginal is his quick absorption into
the white race. In those parts of Australia in
which intermarriage has taken place, all traces
of the aboriginal ancestry of the offspring
have disappeared by the third generation,
the members of which can generally pass
as of European descent. Even by the second
generation the traces of colored blood are usually
very faint, and a curious fact is that they are
invariably fainter in the women than in the men.
These, of course, are external signs; there still re-
main anatomical features which can be deter ted

only by scientific methods. Yet with other colored
races, such as the North American Indians, traces
of an infusion of native blood often remain for as
long as 150 years. The same with African negro
blood, which seems to persist almost indefinitely. It
is on record that a French family which had in-
fused into it a dash of African blood as far back
as 300 years ago still bears in each generation
marked negroid characteristics.

“Bill R.”: I favor the theory that many
fish in a dynamited school recover from the effects.
Off Corunna Rock, on the N.S.W. South Coast, I
once saw Alf Dunn try with a dynamite plug to
rid the Pacific of a shark that kept looting our baits.
Just as the explosion happened a school of salmon
passed over the spot. Immediately scores of them
floundered helplessly. Several with bellies upward
reached the sand. Others threw somersaults in the
aii-. Some floated on the surface, apparently lifeless,
or lay deep down in the water. An untouched portion
of the school made a circle round the site, and then
resumed the rapid northward trek. For two hours
we watched the dazed fellows straggling off to
follow. Only a few dead were left, and in each that
we secured and examined there was a ragged rupture
of the spleemlike strip found under the spinal column.

“Wandi” : Most bush men have a derry on
tne catfish, and when they catch it throw it avvav
with a curse. Yet
when not too old it is
a sweet fish, far
superior to the leather-
jacket, and catching
it with rod and line
in lagoons is good
sport, for the slippery
mud-raker is a strong
tighter. When landed
it grunts its disgust,
and presents a spike
that causes excruciat-
ing pain if it pricks a
finger. Blacks on the
Richmond River call it
yarringulli—-“fish with
whiskers.” Some say
the whiskers attract
inquisitive small fry.
which are thus easily
caught; Special inter-
est attaches to the fish
on account of its nest-
building habit. Th r
nest is usually a ring
of small stones or
pfbbles, where the
spawn is deposited in
season, and where the
fish sleeps a good deal
during the day. Soire-
times the stones have to
be brought a considerable distance, the fish either
pushing them along or carrying them in its mouth.
“W.P.T.” : Does Westralia hold the re-
cord for the heaviest sheep killed and dressed? G. P.
Patterson, of Creaton Farm, Pinjarra, killed it —
a pure-bred Border Leicester, four years old, which
weighed 2151 b. when dressed. Its live weight was
3081 b., and for the three years prior to killing it
yielded an average of 141 b. of wool per year.
“Atherton”: “There’s more in it than the
eye can see” applies to the white-ants’ nest. Birds,
snakes, lizards, centipedes and beetles bore into it
as if it were a residential flat rent free. Many small
bush things get their first glimmer of light within
its mud walls. McLarren, the Cape York Peninsula
birdman, some three years ago found in a nest a
hitherto unknown species of parrot, some of whose
offspring are, I’m told, doing
well at Taronga Park, the
Sydney Zoo. Sometimes a
colony of rats will bore into
a large anthill until it be-
comes a sieve that collapses.
At other times the ants are
eaten out by thousands of
beetles, who, I suppose, live on
the baby residents. An anthill
is of occasional value to the
prospector as well as to the
naturalist. I saw one nest at
Rossville (N.Q.) broken down
with the pick and put
through the sluice box. It
yielded 1 }cwt. of stream tin.
The ants had built the little
black and grey grains into
their nest. On Ebagoolah
goldfield one nest was dished
for 2Joz. of alluvial gold.
But such cases are very rare.
It is only when the ants arc
building their nests near a
dry watercourse with a big
“bar” running across it on
which the alluvial specks lie
bare that the ants pick up the
gold. Still 1 know prospec-
tors who try an antbed just
on the off chance. One such
forlorn hope had a rich re-
ward. The dish showed rough
colors of reef gold. As there
was no creek near, and as the
men guessed the termites had
most likely got their building-
material from close handy,
the party trenched on all
sides of the nest. They struck
a rich trail of flour gold, and
on deepening one of the
trenches came on a rich
floater. It was the cap of a leader just covered by
the soil. Inside seven months it brought them
£2BOO a man before pinching out.

“Tomb”: A supplier to a butter-factory
wrote to the manager asking why his cream was
always graded second-class. The latter replied that,
in his opinion, the trouble was caused through the
farmer’s milking-machines not being thoroughly
clean, and advising him to scald them with boiling
water and soda, being sure to turn them upside-down
to drain and dry. The cocky’s reply was to the
effect that his wife and family were his only milking-
machines, and that they howded like blazes when
he suggested doing it.

“Nugget”: If “Billy See” (B. 28/5/’25)
places a couple of pieces of cans in water, one
standing as it grew and the other reversed, he will
find that the liquid is drawn up each of them. The
same applies to fencing-posts. Reversing them
cannot possibly alter the direction of the flow of
liquid ; in either case the tendency of such attraction
is to take moisture from the ground into the buried
portion of the post, which is then kept wet—not
drained dry as Billy suggests. Posts begin to rot
where they touch the ground, and hence if left lying
at full length are quickly destroyed by having a

large area in contact with the moist earth. How
does “Billy See” account for telegraph poles, which
are invariably erected in the position in which they
grew, having their butts tarred to prevent capillary
action ? Preservation from white ant is not the
only reason for the tar. Cockies put their posts
right side up in order to have the heavier end in
the ground, and thus make a more substantial job.

AUSTRALIAN MADE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Waller captained Mulga Plain
In cricket for a score of years ;
And John possessed a useful brain.
He knew more tricks than all his peers;
For, by his handling, Mulga’s team
Was stronger than it seemed to seem.
John was a bushman tried and true,
Accustomed to big timber lands ;
And anything an axe could do
It did in his tremendous hands.
He also hated foreign trade
And loved all things Australian made.
And though his cricket prowess ran
From ’Possum Ridge to Dingo Flat,
He always worked upon a plan
To find a true Australian bat.
“Willow,” said he, “though soft and tough,
Is not the last and final stuff.”
He tried the Sally wattle-tree,
He wrought a while with stringybark,
He balanced logs upon his knee,
He split up timbers light and dark ;
But nowhere could he find a wood
That smote the leather hard and good.
It was the season Mulga Plain
Had lost five matches right on end.
John went about in heavy pain;
The bush no longer seemed his friehd,
For rugged hill and waving flat
Refused him an Australian bat.
And then he found a little tree
Whose girth was just on three-feet-four,
A dead dry stem with branches three,
No higher than a stable door;
And as the wind began to blow
He saw it waving to and fro.
THE WHOLE TRUTH.
THE P.M: “What was the length of your
residence in Victoria?”
HARASSED WITNESS: "lncluding the kitchen,
I should say about 35 feet.”
Now little trees as thick as that
Should never bend when they are dead.
This one seemed supple as a cat;
Its antics went to Waller’s head.
He said; “My long, hard search is past;
I’ve got the real wood at last!”
And when he went to chop the tree
The wood proved soft, yet tough as wire,
The chips flew- high as he could see
And some of them w ent even higher ;
They soared like birds upon the wing,
Each driven by a secret spring.
The team rolled down to Dingo Flat,
Still smarting from a late defeat.
Waller and Tompkins went to bat—
John with his new-made bat complete.
An ordinary bat it seemed
Where fresh with oil it softly gleamed.
But John appeared in splendid form ;
His strokes were always strong and true.
The shrill wind w'histled like a storm
When fast and far the leather flew.
The lightest tap went swift and free
And always reached the boundary.
It seemed a hopeless task to bowl
Against such matchless sight and skill.
John played the game with all his soul
And smote with all his dashing will.
Cut, snick or drive, he could not score
By any effort less than four.
The other batsmen came and went
With runs or no runs to their name;
But Waller, in a great content,
Pursued his poised and perfect game,
Till Hoskins, who could stick like glue,
Stayed in an hour while scoring two.
That hour beheld one bowler faint
And two dissolve in bitter tears.
John scored and scored without restraint;
And Mulga’s loud esctatic. cheers
Were heard a hundred miles or so
From where the proud throats let them go.
But all good things must end at last.
The final wicket clicked and fell ;
The captain’s splendid innings past
In one prolonged and cheerful yell.
For Waller’s most amazing score
Stood cn the board at four-four-four!
That was the first of many days
That all seemed very much the same ;
The country maddened with his praise
Till all men rushed to watch his game.
At ’Possum Ridge the “gate” was such
They took a thousand pounds too much.
But John was modest through it all,
Though out upon the Castlereagh
Before the final wicket’s fall
He scored a thousand in a day.
From Dead Man’s Gap to Dingo Flat
He always carried out his bat.
Yet, when selected for the Test
Against a conquering English team,
He said that at his very best
He was not quite what he might seem—
In fact, he said, his game might pass.
But was not of the Test-match class. '
But those selectors fierce and strong,
Who rule with power beyond a king’s.
Knew that their choice was never wrong;
They made the tune and pulled the strings
Until at last they brought him down
To show his skill in Sydney town.
And so, when Collins won the toss,
John walked with him across the sward.
The turf was smooth as mountain moss,
The dark crowd roared his fame’s reward;
And all the air was big with fate
Where first Australian wood faced Tate.
The leather came, it clicked, it flew,
The air was full of hissing sound ;
But where it went to no man knew.
It simply rose and left the ground—
“ Lost ball” they called it; and they fix
The worth of a lost ball at six.
The eight-ball over is a thing
O’er which there still is loud debate ;
But little sparrows on the wing
Looked down and made a jest of Tate.
From that first over, on the board,
Four dozen runs were shown as scored.
Waller and Collins played a game
The world had never seen before.
The people who call' cricket tame
Might, then have revelled deep in gore.
One ball that to the grandstand sped
Knxked off a tall spectator’s head !
And when a fieldsman tried to snatch
The ball that seemed within his reach,
Not only did he miss the catch,
But uttered an astonished screech.
Before the crowd had time to scoff
They found that half his hand was off!
They tried the new fast bowler then—
A man called Bash who came from Kent,
He seemed to have the strength of ten.
Like some keen whip his back was bent;
And when he let the leather fly
No man could trace it with his eye.
It struck the bat a sounding crash.
The watchers saw a flash of fire.
It made a sudden hole in Bash—
The umpire helped him to expire—
And where the champion took his stand
The bat was burning in his hand.
He tried to quench the scorching wood
M ith frantic efforts that were vain;
The flames had gripped it hard and good,
The sparks flew upward from the grain.
And when the fire brigade arrived
Only a small charred lump survived.
Ah well, it little boots to tell
The tale of Waller’s after play.
Tate bowled; the central wicket fell ;
The hero slowly walked away.
His second innings showed worse leak ;
He stayed one ball and went for duck’.
John Waller plays no more in Tests;
He goes like some wild beast of prey.
He never sleeps, he never rests;
But through the forest night and day
He searches mountain vale and flat
To find a tree to make a bat.
Alas, that bat unique and grand
He only sees again in dreams!
But sometimes you may watch him stand
And in his eye Miere softly gleams
A gentle tear that will not spill—
He keeps the treasured ashes still!

DEWAR’S
THE SPIRIT OF HUMOUR
Humour is the spring that sets laughter going. It plays a great part in the scheme
of things; easing many a strain and lightening many a burden. ror when
all is said and done a good laugh puts one in tune with life and so does the
genial charm of

DEWAR’S


WHY NOT EXTERMINATE THOSE RABBITS?
It’s simple and sure enough if you use
CALCIUM CYANIDE
FUMO
BRAND
—for this wonderful preparation leaves no loop-
hole of escape.
It is blown into the warren, where it generates death-dealing
fumes for at least twenty-four hours. The dust penetrates
even the deepest dead-ends, and rises in a cloud to show
every opening, so that the operator knows exactly what he
is doing.
Results are CERTAIN with CALCIUM
CYANIDE, and it is the cheapest known
method.
For its application the Fumo Dust
Blower is recommended. It is simple,
strong and easily portable.

“Bungaree Savage”:. Both “Einel” (B.
21/6/’25) and “D.C.” (B. 23/4/’25) record big crops
of wheat, but some small holdings near Cressy (Tas.)
can beat them badly. From a nine-acre patch one
cocky took 300 bags of first-class grain, and another
harvested 420 bags from 16 acres.
* * * *
“Billy See”: Dave Lindsay’s camels are
supposed to have gone 14 days without water; but
my brother, returning from a prospecting trip, had
his camels lie down and refuse to proceed after
being 10 days without a drink. Nothing w'ould
induce them to rise until two days later, when,
getting a bucketful of water each, they resumed
work. ’Ghans, in camp, usually w r ater their beasts
about once in four days.
“Nomad”: Recently at Greenbushes
(W.A.) during a thunderstorm a globe of dazzling light
entered a school-hall by one window, floated across
the room, and exploded on contact with the opposite
wall. The incident was witnessed by the school-
mistress and the scholars, who were having a singing
lesson. Such “ball-lightning” is comparatively rare,
and has never been satisfactorily explained. One
extraordinary thing about it is that it travels quite
slowly.
“Lobjc”: “Jacky Iioo” is right about
sheep being able to live for an indefinite period
without w'ater, provided there’s enough green feed
about (B. 7/5/’2 5). Near Gunnedah, about 20
years ago, our stud ewes suddenly went blind; 500
of them. No one knew why—in fact, I don’t to
this day. We put them in a small lucerne paddock
which had a mill and trough in one corner. They
got better in three months or so, and meantime be-
came fat and hearty, yet they never touched the
water in the trough.
“Tamornie”: I have seen the barking-
lizard mentioned by “Slam” (B. 28/5/’25) in the
spinifex desert s.-w. of Avon Downs (N.T.).
Its cry is not loud, and resembles a faint bark at
a distance. On first meeting the reptile it caused
me to think that blacks with their dogs were in
the vicinity, till a “boy” with me pointed one out>
saying with a grin: “There that one dog you bin
hearem !” The lizard is very much like the common
stumpy-tail, but its scales are finer and the tail
is more pointed. It is also more active.
* * * #
“Fits!”: A friend of the late John Allan,
of Kimbrild, Upper Manning (N.S.W.), was on a
cedar-hunting expedition on the Hastings River. He
missed his track, and one night got bushed. Early
next morning he struck a blacks’ camp. Sitting in
a corner he saw a toothless, wizened old gin of
repulsive ugliness. On seeing the white intruder
her eyes sparkled, and, springing like a monkey
from her recumbent position, she threw her bony
NO SOFT ANSWER ’BOUT THAT.
“Wha's ’ee b'long makin' av, William John?”
“ Thai’s my business.”
“Aw, cs it! Well, taake and mind your business, an’ doan't
’ave s' milch to say.”
arms round his neck, and twined her legs about
his waist. She kissed him forcibly and often, making
a peculiar noise the while. Evidently she was
delighted to see him. The cedar-cutter eventually
got free, and before he left the camp gathered from
the patriarchal gin that she regarded him as her
dead son, who had gone down the dark valley a
blackfellow and “jumped up” on the other side a
brand-new whitefellow.
* * * *
“Dry”: I liave tried “Yarrum’s” hypnotic
stare (B. 14/5/’25) on a dangerous bullock I wanted
to shift out of a paddock. The beast should have
heeded it, for I meant business. It did not, how-
ever, but bundled me out twice. The next time
I faced the beast it was with a waddy 3in. in
diameter. When it charged I brought the waddy
down, the blow falling partly on one horn and
partly on the right spot. Unfortunately the stick
broke, so I dropped it. The beast then lowered its
head to thrust and I grasped both horns, just as
tney entered my clothes. Twisting its head and
pressing downward, I brought the beast to his
knees. Trying the icy look and using a fluttered
rag may be all right if the beast knows you and
you know it well ; but be prepared, if you are
sure you can do it, to grasp a horn and at the
same time the beast’s muzzle, and then by twisting
smartly and pressing downward, you will throw
your opponent.
* » * *
“Lenochre”: In the wet season I have
seen mosquitoes in solid phalanx across the Sepik
River (New' Guinea), and a night of misery awaits
all on board the recruiting vessel that cannot make
the open sea before dusk. These blood sucking sleep
destroyers are, however, not of the malaria-carrying
type, that species not being found in droves. Some
of the small coral islands of Ninigo and Admiralty
groi ps are as bad at times, though only when a
strong breeze comes direct across the freshwater
lagoon, usually found in the centre of coral-formed
islands, where the mosquito breeds. It was to
benefit the “boys” working in such places that a
rece..t Native Labor Ordinance Amendment provided
for an issue of mosquito netting l?y employers.
Natives in their villages make smoke fires, of odori-
ferous fuel to combat the pest, while far up the
Sepik River a kind of hooded sleeping-bag made of
tepee cloth and lawyer-vine is used. These quaint
contraptions are much prized by curio-hunters.
* * * *
“Munjong”: “T.G.8.” (B. 14/5/’25) may
be wrong when he states that the goats on Walpole
Island have not for years past had a drink of water.
Some time before the war a co. was formed and
a lease of Guadeloupe Island, off the coast of Lower
California, obtained from the Mexican Government.
The object of the co. was to breed goats for export,
-_.c after a trial the project was abandoned owing
to failure of the fresh-water supply. Goats being a
drug in the market at the time, a considerable
flock of breeding animals was also abandoned. If
these continue to multiply as they have done to
date, there will soon be hardly standing-room on
the island. This, how'ever, is not likely to happen,
as the unfortunate creatures have almost denuded
the place of vegetation of every description, and now
are even eating seaweed washed up on the beaches.
Close observations have proved that these goats regu-
larly drink the seawater, and it is probable that
the Walpole Island goats do likewise.
* * * *
“G.P.L.F.”: Several shire councils in
N.S.W. are paying a dollar per head for dead eagle-
hawks, but not many are
coming to hand despite
the big inducement. This
expert lamb-killer is doing
thousands of pounds’ worth
of damage per annum, and
is one of the problems our
sheep-breeders are up
against. At Larras Lane
station, in the Moloug
district (N.S.W.), where
last year the eagles killed
close on £5OO worth ot
lambs, the owner has hit
on a dodge whereby he ha?
despatched 500 of the
winged pest already this
season. He tried : having
one of the hands wrap him-
self in a sheepskin to get
close to the birds and
shoot them, but it didn’t
work. He then tied a
rabbit to a post and
placed a gunman in
ambush, but this also was
a failure. Now his modus
,operandi is to place half
a dozen live pigeons under
a wire-netting cage in
close proximity to a num-
ber of rabbit-traps con-
cealed just under the
ground. When- the eagle
pounces down for a feed
of pigeon,, he finds that the
feast is not" within. .his
reach, and hops off the
netting to 'deyise a -way,
of getting at "the birds.
That is his undoing, for
in a couple of steps he is
caught by the leg in one
of the traps. His cries
soon bring his cobbers
along to investigate, and
they meet with the same
fate. The only trouble in
this scheme is that a man
has to be kept handy to
give the coup de,. grace to
the trapped eagles. But he more than earns his
wages.
* * * *
“James B.”; “Yarrum’s” record bag of
ducks (B. 16/4/’25), 17 for two barrels, is a poor
score compared with that of Jerry Leary, a sporting
publican of Gundagai (N.S.W.). Coming on a mob
of wood ducks where Kimo Creek joins the ’Bidgee
below the town, he gathered in 32 with the two
barrels. In 1865, when w T e were living on the
shores of Lake George, my father shot over 100
ducks in ope week from our kitchen window. A
heavy rainstorm came in the middle of threshing,
and a quantity of wheat was washed down to the
lake, scattered grains being left en route. At that
time ducks were literally in thousands on the lake
and the normal food supply being insufficient for
the number, they followed the trail of grain right
up to the house.
“Tamornie”; For the longest spear-throw
I nominate this. Paddy, a boy from one of the '
Daly River tribes, while working on the Batchelor
GETTING ON.
“Saved enough for a new car yet?”
“No, but we have a dinner-waggon.”
(N.T.), was asked to demonstrate his skill. This
he did, first by hitting a post 70 yards away several
times, and then by throwing one spear 212yds. This
cast was taped off. The spear used was about Bft.
long, of reed, with about 15ih. of ironwood for a
head. Its greatest diameter was Jin. Thus it is
that I doubt “Wingella’s” statement (B. 28/5/’25)
about a Melville Island black throwing a spear
150yds. ; the Melville spears are so heavy that I
think 50yds. would be the very most one could oe
thrown.
“Riverina”; Near Masterton (M.L.) re-
cently a half-bred Persian cat gave a striking demon-
stration of hypnotic power, a cattle-dog being the
“subject.” The animals gazed fixedly at each other
till the dog became ■ completely spellbound, where-
upon puss suddenly moved forwai’d and viciously
clawed his face. The dog seemed incapable of defence
and fell helpless on his side ; a gunshot settled the
cat. Instead of recovering the hypnotised victim
rapidly became worse —his body was distorted and
his eyes protruded hideously—so a friendly shot
ended his misery likewise. I have always regarded
a cattle-dog as a particularly hard-headed customer.
Does' the Council know of a similar case?
V # # * *
“Bunya” : What fish have been introduced
into this country besides the trout ? Our native
trout is a mere whitebait only a few inches long,
but the American rainbow-trout is now quite at
home here. I have taken these showy blue-green
and purple sporting fish up to 71b. weight, and
they have always put up a spirited fight. The
English brown trout is also acclimatised. But I know
of no other non-Australian fish, in spite of the
constant arguments of riverside anglers.
* * * *
“Up North”: On headlands of the Cape
York Peninsula coast and also on adjacent islands
are aboriginal lookouts for turtle, in use for many
ages. On Albany Island stands one specially notice-
able. It is a cairn atop of a pyramid of rocks. At
one cairn on the peninsula are mingled the bones
of turtle, dugong and men—such relics are supposed
to bring good luck to the watchers. In some of
the bone heaps a trailing creeper is planted which
is sure to bring the turtle swimming that way.
Near the favored look-out possies are turtle skulls
in hundreds decorating the branches of trees. As
the turtle drift by the look-out man signals; the
niggers man the canoes and are off in pursuit.
Mostly they use the harpoon, but sometimes they
feel a bit sporty and quietly swimming up to a
sleeping turtle, endeavor to turn him over on his
back. I’ve seen bucks with deep gashes on the
insides of their legs through the rim of the shell
biting deep into their gripping legs as they tried
to ride him. More frequently such wounds are
received from the hawksbill turtle, which has got
a sharper marginal rope on its shell than have other
species.
“Coolabah”: Although most of the star-
lings camp among the reeds at night, flying for
miles to their feeding-grounds in the morning, some
are regular housekeepers, and never go far from
their homes. Watching them, I have wondered
'whether these stay-at-homes are acting as caretakers.
The starlings have usurped the hollow trees once
occupied by native birds, and maybe the job of
holding them is not always easy. The nests, by
the way, are re-lined for winter with wool from the
backs of living jumbucks. Perhaps, too, the birds
feed on the vermin for which sheep are dipped.
Some sheep certainly attract more birds than others
do; and that looks as though the birds were there
because they had found a specially good feeding-
place.
* * * *
“Linklater”: A Townsville photographer
recently had a strange couple brought to his studio.
One was a 9ft. 3in. carpet-snake, and its companion
a dignified old duck. The latter was contentedly
at work bringing out a setting of young ducks when
the snake invited her inside. He had barely finished
licking his jaws when he was captured and the
duck extracted, little the worse for her unpleasant
experience.
* * * *
“AdeL”: Prospectors and others who
wander over the lonely hills and the desolate
scrub lands of the Far North have good friends
among the birds? of those remote regions. Recently,
at our camp, a great commotion arose—incessant,
agitated twittering from a flock of chestnut-tailed
thornbills, rather rare little birds, natives of the
Northern forests. The disturbance induced us to go
outside of our tent, where we saw a black object
in the fork of a tree, near our camp. A shot from
an automatic brought down a fair-sized black snake;
but unfortunately we lost it in the flood water
surrounding the tree.
* * * *
“Pick” : For waggon-building and general
coach work where a tough and durable timber is
required the Australian product known in the bush
as “urabbie,” or, within the confines of the small
trade it has attained, as “jinniegreen,” may some-
day supplant the imported American hickory. Even
experienced timber men sometimes pass a urabbie -
tree owing to its outward resemblance to the inferior
ribbon-gum, but a test readily establishes the species.
The thinnest shred lifted from the trunk may be
drawn for yards along the barrel without breaking.
Larger strands may be plaited or knotted like strips
of greenhide. The urabbie grows extensively in the
forests of Tumbarumba, and, though sparsely, along
the N.S.W. South Coast range. It has a white-and-
brown streaked close grain, is hard but bendable and
springy, and is locally prized for waggon poles and
wheel spokes.


A FIGHT FOR MILLIONS
FOR AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY!
tw
Msf
ZAlia
AOVA
FOR years—even before the
great war —the Dunlop Rubber
Co. consistently endeavoured
without success to obtain a
portion of the equipment tyre
business on new cars imported
and sold in Australia. The
result of these tyre importations
was that millions of pounds of Austialian money
went overseas to enrich other countries and ensure
employment for their workers. Then came the
years of war during which trying period the
Dunlop Co. helped materially to keep motor
wheels turning in Australasia—despite shortages
in materials, and inferior quality at that! Since
the war period motoring has gone ahead in
remarkable fashion, car registrations in the
Commonwealth jumping from 50,000 since the
beginning of 1919, to over 200,000 at the end of
1924, but despite the fact that Dunlop Railroad
tyres had won a great reputation for service and
economy and were acknowledged by even our
overseas competitors to be wonderful mileage
givers on Australian roads —we were not given a
chance of participating in the equipment tyre trade.
All efforts failed to secure Australia its
legitimate right to have the opportunity of
securing a reasonable portion of the business of
supplying tyres for the tens of thousands of new
cars being sold in Australia. Then came the Cord
tyxe followed by the low pressure Balloon—
and again the u Dunlop ” maintained its high
reputation for quality, value and service, but
oversea interests still prevented the tyre manu-
facturers of this country from getting a reasonable
share of the equipment business. Australian
Motor Traders —who desired and preferred to fit
Dunlop Tyres experience having demonstrated
their superiority on Australian roads —found that
their efforts to change the policy of the car maker
were unsuccessful and the same answer was
always forthcoming—“ They had to take cars
with tyres fitted!” Despite the continual
set back in this direction, the output of
Dunlop Tyres increased, motorists buying them
throughout Australia for replacement purposes.
This progress was won by sheer merit, sales
increased month by month, and due provision
was made in our extensive plant to cope with
same Then towards the end of 1924 came
a great change of front by Exporters
of Cars the advantages of fitting Australian
made Dunlop tyres being so apparent and out-
standing that the policy of shipping tyre equipped
cars into this country was practically discontinued.
Here’s the sequel! After this decision
followed consultations quotes then orders for
thousands of “ Dunlops,” then tens of thousands more
“ Dunlops ” all to equip new chassis coming forward
into this country minus tyres. Our plant pulsated as
it had never done before our operatives were increased
__ and three shifts a day were worked, and still more
Traders came along without any prior notice and wanted
immediately big quantities of Dunlop covers and tubes.
Now a rubber plant with its heavy metal moulds,
vulcanisers, etc., which take a considerable time to
duplicate—has its limit of output. New orders were
rushed out for machinery to help us cope with a new
phase of the business which we had long striven for
and had with little warning— suddenly attained. We.
never anticipated and were certainly not prepared lor,
such a dramatic rush of orders. a
Throughout the automobile world it is the policy of
tyre manufacturers to supply tyres to equip new cars at
practically cost price thereby co-operating with car
makers in reducing the price of cars to the public,
thus cheapening and popularising motoring.
Despite the fact that the equipment business is not a
dividend earning proposition— like the replacement, trade
we decided on strenuous efforts to “make good’’ and
not jeopardise the retainment in Australia of this
important trade. It meant potential millions of pounds
staying in this country (500,000 covers and tubes came
into Australia on new cars during 1923 and 1924) but
it also meant sacrificing to a degree the natural
increase in our valuable replacement trade.
Our mills have achieved almost the impossible doubling
the tyre output since December last but unfortunately
and regretfully some of our loyal patrons have been
unable to obtain Dunlops in certain sizes and they have
had to buy other makes. In the circumstances —we
opine— not many Australian citizens will blame us for our
efforts on behalf of Australian industry, and we look forward
with confidence to regaining lost replacement trade, for
additional plant and more Australian
workers now enables us to supply all orders for
Dunlop Tyres the recognised best tyre on Australian
roads to-day, and they are listed at the
lowest price in the Commonwealth
and sold at a figure that represents a
considerable saving in initial outlay, and further
economy owing to the outstanding service they ensure.

The Federal session was opened with pomp
and gold braid in the Senate Chamber by
the G.-G., gorgeous in his uniform of Field-
Marshal, particular interest hovering around
the event because it was the last time his
Ex. would perform the rite. It is said also
that, though floods divide, next year’s conver-
sation will be at Canberra. The passing
through the city of the vice-regal carriage
with its four white prancing steeds and pos-
tilions drew a ciowd and a cheer, and was
something of a personal triumph for the
popular G.-G. and her Ex. The pink and
blue tickets came early, and Senators’ wives,
the populace and the press who joined the
melee late were told they could be an informal
guard of honor in the corridor. Anxious
officials cautiously pushed in upon the floor
of the House the couldn’t-be-left-outs, with
whispered requests for goodness sake not
to take the front seats. The fur-and-cloth-
coated sweltered. The salute boomed, then
there was a flash of naval braid, a splash of
military crimson and khaki and the G.-G.
had passed in. When members of the House
of Reps, had been summoned, the crush of
carefree politicians was like a happy family
united by Father Christmas. In dead silence
and increasing warmth the gathering list-
ened to the Things to be Carefully Considered,
from £08,000,000 war loans falling due to
the eradication of dingoes. A few minutes
afterwards the crowd was streaming up the
carpeted staircase to swarm like locusts over
the refreshments. When it was all over
there was left hardly a crumb upon a crumb
or a petal on a flower, and silver and gold
baskets of blossoms were seen departing in
the hands of feminine souvenir-hunters.
Senators and their womenfolk feasted pri-
vately upon substantial fare amid pink
dahlias, heath and oak leaves. It is only
fair to state tnat their floral decorations
were untouched.
The gowning was not startling—the days
are over when women purchased * smart
gowns for the opening of Parliament. Lady
Forster displayed black velvet millinery and
a fawn feather mount with her suit of stone-
hue ; and Mrs. Bruce wrapped her gold-
embroidered frock in kolinsky. His Grace
of Melbourne was with Mrs. Lees, whose
blue coat was grey fur-trimmed. An in-
terested visitor was Italian airman Di
Pinedo, wearing his grey-blue I.A.F. uni-
form. Consuls and wives, including the Ger-
man, were there, and Sir Geoi’ge Buchanan
was looking for signs of degeneration
amongst the assembly due to the Melbourne
climate.
The newly-appointed Sergeant-at-Arms in
the Federal Parliament, E. W. P'arkes, made
his debut at the opening of the session. He
is not much taller than the sword that
dangles from his side and vei'y little thicker,
and members await with interest the time
when he will be called xxpon to remove a poli-
tician of the proportions of Riverina’s repre-
sentative or Gwydir’s chosen. However,
what he lacks in brawn lie makes up in
moral courage. Already lie has created a
precedent by discarding knee-breeches for
ordinary strides, and there would be fewer
frivolous remarks if at least one other mem-
ber of the staff adopted similar garments.
For about a quarter of an hour St. Ivilda
was Australia when Mayor Levi handed the
freedom of his seaside suburb to Italian air-
man Pinedo after he had dropped from out
the dull heavens on to the placid waters of
the bay. It was the flying-man’s day out.
Sapphire-blue uniforms ringed the visitor
round as if they feared the 20,000 onlookers
might frighten the shy bird into at once
spreading his pinions again. A charming
sight was the coming through grey clouds
of the traveller with his escort of two sea-
planes and some 18 aeros. The Savoia
alighted so gently upon the water as to raise
barely a l’ipple, while local ’planes flew noisily
about, so like birds at variance that it re-
quired little imagination to hear the flapping
of wings as they skimmed and dived so low
as almost to stir the lifted hair of the mul-
titude. The ’plane safely buoyed, St. Hilda’s
Yacht Club provided its best craft for tran-
sit to the pier, Italian Consul-General Gi'os-
sardi proudly introducing his countryman,
the latter compounded of smiles, stocky body,
fresh complexion, blue eyes and greying hair,
in a knickerbocker suit of grev tweed; his
mechanic. Marshal Campanelli, a typical
swarthy Italian, dai'kly clad. In the absence
of Priminister Bruce, Minister for Defence
Ilowse extended his hand to hands already
laden with posies trailing orchids and the
national colors. The Mayor, in all the glory of
office and with aldennanic support, stood like
an Arab on his praying-mat and pronounced
a benediction. Di Pinedo, used to obstacles,
tackled the English language in thanks—
and then gratefully accepted a cigarette from
his mechanic, while an Aussie flier provided
a light. The crowd took the smoke-oh as
a signal to rush ; and police and A.F.C. were
swept aside, and intelligent folk wisely
chaired the heroes, saving them from de-
struction at the hands of their admirers.
And perhaps the very happiest person in the
throng was the agent for the 450-11. p. Lor-
raine-Deitrich engine, which, by the way, is
French and not Italian. It has carried the
travellers 14,000 miles without disaster.
St. John’s, at Toorak, a bower of pink-and-
white blossoms amid autumn foliage, was the
scene of the wedding of Mary Valerie, elder
daughter of Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Hall-
Thompson, and Ronald Austin. Bridegroom,
who owns Eilyer, Lake Bolac, is the elder
son of the A. S. Austins of Toorak. Arch-
bishop Lees and Naval-Chaplain Charles
Hudson saw the knot was truly tied to choral
accompaniment. Tall, slender and dark-
haired, the bride wore mother’s wedding-
gown “made over” ; it was of parchment-toned
satin flounced with Limerick lace, with cob-
webby drapery over the train and billows of
tulle veil. Her sister Rosemary and the
groom’s sister Hope ’maided in pale gold
veils floating above vellum-hued satin and
ecru lace. Ford Guthrie and Geoff. Austin
guarded the ’groom. Governor Stradbroke
was a spectator and wedding-gifts included
some morning-tea appurtenances from the
Countess. The R.A.N. Friendly Union of
Sailors’ Wives and Mothers, which has Mrs.
Hall-Thompson as president, sent along a
floral arch and formed a guard of honor.
Guests were regaled at the Austins’ spacious
Toorak home, Mrs. Hall-Thompson hostessing
in brown and fawn, gold embroidered. Blue
water and pasture lands were represented in
equal numbers —amongst the latter the Mof-
fats of Berrambool, Mrs. E. Austin of Boori-
yalloak, Mrs. E. Austin of Yallambee, and
Dr. and Mrs. Gilruth and daughter Jean,
who weds Ken Austin shortly.
The members of the Women’s Art Club
have the upper Athenaeum Hall for a show
that will run till the 27tli. One of the
things that grandma would have called a
swarry is listed for Saturday, when a talk by
Blamire Young will be wedged in between
musical offerings. Miss L. Harvie lion, sec-
retaries the colorful event.
Assembly Hall these days is a haunt of
culture, for Dorothea Spinney, of the beauti-
fully modulated voice and graceful willowi-
ness, began her season with a first Australian
performance of the “Electra” of Euripides.
Her aim, as a few years ago, is to put us
on a friendly footing with the plays of
Ancient Greece so that we will no longer be
in awe of Orestes, Iphigenia, Clytemnestra
and all those other ancient folk around whom
tragedy lingers. For her opening night she
wore flowing draperies of grey, her unsliingled
locks being swathed in the same color.
Baskets of pink blossoms were handed up
by the first-nighters, who included the
Littleton Groom lady and daughter Jessie,
Knight Allen's wife and Miss Mary Allen,
Miss Ethel Bage, Mrs. Herbert Brookes,
Mrs. M. Quinnel (secretary of the Austral
Salon) and Miss A. Michaelis.
This is the wife of knight John Grice,
vice-chancellor of Melbourne Uni., a barrister
b y training
and a director
of banks and
other financial
enterprises by
predilection. It
would be hard
to say which
is the more
useful of the
fine pair. Over
three years
ago the lady
organised a
Red Cross
Auxiliary So-
ciety in Too-
rak to help
along the Mel-
bourne Hospi-
tal, and her
good example
was followed
by 11 other
brancheswhich
have since been brought under the control
of a central executive. She did splendid
Work during the Great War, and her hus-
band assisted as lion, treasurer of the Red
Cross Society. Their eldest son was killed
in the Boer unpleasantness, and another
made the supreme sacrifice in France. The
other day the energetic lady was presented
by her fellow hospital-workers with a Red
Cross Auxiliary badge as a tribute to her
efforts. The picture is by Lafayette.
William Parlett Heath, of Bairnsdale,
married his Gippsland girl, Hazel Eileen
Mason, at the Toorak kirk, the lady present-
ing herself in shimmering apparel of white
satin and georgette, with train attachment of
silver tissue and a pinky gleam. . Three
charming maidens stood by, arrayed in silver
lame shining through rainbow-embossed geor-
gette, their coiffures turbaned with glisten-
ing fabric. Two small bairuies with lace
friilings on ivory satin steered the leading
lady’s train. The cake portioning took place
at !) Darling-street.
Mrs. Bowes Kelly and her trio of charm-
ing daughters have just farewelled Mrs. D.
Fripp, who has repacked her trunks for Eng-
land. Black-robed, the hostess extended the
welcoming hand to many guests, among whom
were the Hennessy lady add daughter Valerie,
the Robinson lady and daughter Nan, Mar-
got Best and her mother. Mrs. Fripp
made her adieus in ivory cloth and white
fox fur attached to white felt millinery.
All a-gleam in a Juliet gown of silver
lame with a crystal girdle, heaps of train
and veiling of rare old Limerick lace, Jean
Apperly plunged into the matrimonial lot-
tery with barrister Fred, son of Dr. and Mrs.
Morris Gamble, of Kew. The very good-
looking bride is only daughter of bank-
manager W. B. Apperly, of Maldon. A trio
of ’maids —Moira Bryans, Marjorie Ralph
and Enid McQuie —were green spring shoots
with shingled polls. Horace and Herbert
Gamble and Jack Apperly (he is to wed
the McQuie maid) saw the ’groom through.
Dinner and dance followed at the Windsor
where the hostess stood in black with bright-
enings of flame tones.
The subject of this picture is the attrac-
tive wife of Commendatore Antonio Gros-
sardi, Italian
Consul - Gen-
eral for Aus-
tralia and
M.L. Though
she shuns the
limelight the
coming of her
countryman Di
Pinedo on his
historic flight
from Rome to
T o k i o has
pushed her
into promi-
nence as host-
ess at func-
tions presided
over by her
popular hus-
band. Lafay-
ette’s camera
recorded the
lady’s looks.
The Catholic Women’s Social Guild will
be able to push on its charitable work through
the overflowing patronage accorded a cafe
chantant at the Ambassadors. Bishop Mc-
Carthy, of Bendigo, took tea with the flock
and listened to a programme of music pre-
pared by accompanist Alice Madigan—Rita
Miller, Vera Bedford and Joseph Foster were
the songsters, and Cecil Parkes’s violin aided
the cafe’s orchestra. Auctions of attractive
articles helped the proceeds. Mrs. Hartigan
was president and Miss Murphy secretaried.
There is a hitch in the proposed distribu-
tion of a half-pint of soup all round to the
kiddies attending certain schools. The gen-
erously-disposed folk who were prepared to
gather the money and distribute the nourish-
ment have received a set-back from the Edu-
cation Department, and for the moment the
stock-pot is cold, and soup is off.
The winter sales have come into bloom
this week. Like the temperature, prices
fall vastly overnight, and the unattainable
figleaf of to-day can be picked up at half
the price to-morrow. Two Bourke-street em-
poriums are chasing each other’s tails, and
the prospective bargain-hunter dares not
enter the door of temptation of the one until
she carefully scans the display windows of
the other. Friday saw the first big party
of tourists set out for the winter sports of
Mt. Buffalo, and some very dandy apparel
went with it. The sales provided the turn-
outs at quite reasonable rates. Correct clad-
ding for these excursions usually costs as
much as the tour itself, so fervent thanks
are going up for the bargain epidemic.
The rooftree of the Herbert Brookes pair
sheltered a recent private pianoforte recital
by artist Goll. and (jO guests heard old and
modern melodies under perfect conditions.
The hostess handed round a bit to eat in
black velvet, fur-decked and gold-embroid-
ered ; daughter Jessie wore pink. Henri
Verbrugghen’s near arrival in Australia to
visit his sons (one of them is Dr. Adrian!
caused a hope to be expressed that Mel-
bourne’s moneyed would put up the cash to
keep him here, since his departure was a
regrettable mistake. Of the invited were
knight Rittleton Groom and his partner,
Robert Garran and his lady, the newly-
handled Professor Harrison Moore and his
lady, the Elmer Pauleys, Mrs. iEneas Gunn,
contralto Violet Somerset and soprano Rosa
Pinkerton —the last is off shortly to try her
clear notes in the Big Smoke.
Doris Dinham (she writes short stories
as “D. Manners Sutton”) is being missed
in the office of the Rhodes Motor Cycle Co.,
where she used to be publicity manager,
The little live wire with the bobbed golden
hair and grey eyes has mated with a Queensi
land girl, Mildred Holmes, for a motor-cycle
and sidecar trip through Africa from the,
Cape to Cairo; and if they got through there
will be a further jaunt through Europe.
There are difficulties to be met in Africa,
however, one of them being the disapproval
of Authority to such risks being taken by
women. Two who previously tried to make
the journey were turned back. But the
adventurous Australian girls, both of them
in their early twenties, think they can per-
suade Authority that they are quite able
to take care of themselves.
Squadron-leader MacNamara, V.C., and
his wife departed Ron don wards by the Mooi-
tan. Wives|of officers of the Air Force said
their farewells to Mrs. Mac. during a tea;
drinking at the Oriental.
Arrivals from the Great Smoke per way
of S’Afriea include Hon. Mrs. Robert Rind-
say and her daughters. She was Miss Mary
Clarke, one of the late baronet William’s
famjly.
Trippers to Honolulu by the Aorangi early
next month will include the ex-mayoral
Weedon dame, who presides over the A.W.N.
Club, and Mrs. A. M. Dale, who also belongs.
Ministering angels of the Women’s Hos-
pital who are rejoicing in new quarters had
a one-stepping there before the furnishings be-
came fixtures. The function was engineered
by the president, Mrs. A. V. Hiskens, and
the committee. The hostess wore black
sheathing Avith brilliants, and Matron Capuer
also was in draperies of black.
A word or two from Adelaide: —
John Fisher, who was Elder Scholar in 1912 and
had. his plans for subsequent study in Europe knocked
on the head by Germany’s bout of lunacy, has
decided to make singing his only job and has set
off in search of wider fields. Peter Dawson gives
his word that the young man’s fine bass should carry
him far.
There is to be a permanent shelter-shed on the
lawns at the Children’s Hospital, thanks to a cheque
for £lOO from London signed by Lady Bridges.
Also, work on the new Out-patients’ Department
has begun—doctors and patients alike can testify to
the age-old need for that— and the hospital’s next
business will be to find the income to meet the
increased upkeep.
Prince Alfred College has had a windfall of
pictures from its painting-master, James Ashton —
works of his own, Will Ashton, George Webb, H.
P. Gill and Olson. They are to be hung in
the school’s new library.
The War Memorial continues to drag. As new
plans are to be called for, the scheme may be said
to have got back to where it started. Meanwhile
a mighty silence has fallen on the discussion anent
the moving of Government House, and the public is
so fed up with the big bungle that it doesn't much
care whether there is a memorial or not, or whether
Government House is at Oodnadatta or Bowden.
Before Bolshevism set itself to reform the world,
with Ait included, Chuhalden was violin soloist in
the Imperial Grand Opera, Moscow, but what he
was matters less than what he is. His playing
with the State Orchestra in the Town Hall was a
delight, and many in this State are inclined to
regard him as the finest master this city has heard.
We’ve a new musical society—the Adelaide
Metropolitan Choral —under the baton of Capt. Hugh
King. At the initial performance three of his
own compositions were on the programme.
Hunting began in earnest with a run at Nairne.
Lunch was in a marquee pitched near the Mt.
Beevor homestead, once the property of the* Murray
clan, but now belonging to N. E. Brice, who was
the Club’s host. Feminine followers included Mrs.
Teesdale Smith, Miss Brown and Mrs. A. M. Toll.
The Royal Yacht Squadron had luck in striking
the break in the weather for its annual dance.
Bunting, Queensland fern and blue-gum transformed
the deck of the Nestor into a ballroom, and the
supper-room was a delicate affair of pink and white.
A full crew manned the committee, including the
Arthur Rymills, J. 11. Gosses, H. 11. Duttons, Alan
MacFarlanes, Mrs. Dudley Hayward and her son,
and the K. D. Bowmans.
Girton House used gum branches as a background
to the gold and scarlet of autumn leaves for its hop
at the Osborne Hall. How-d’-do’s were said by half
a dozen of the committee, and among the most
welcome of the guests was the school’s head-
mistress, Mrs. J. A. Smith, who has been on the sick
list for a long and weary time.
The Government House Ball was smallish and
mostly young. It is no mean business to galvanise
into temporary life a house that has been shut up
and in dust-sheets for months, but the Pooles (who
are not living at the House) accomplished it. Mrs.
Poole was in Oriental tissue furred at the hem,
and of her daughters one was in mauve crepe de
Chine, crystal-beaded and furred, and the other
in vivid yellow satin. Four debs, were the youngest
of the Tom Barr Smiths’ daughters, in white
georgette and crystal, and the Misses M. Scales,
N. Letcher and M. Vaughan.
A street accident by night—apparently sheer bad
luck with nobody to blame —has closed the useful
life of Dorothy Kentish, who was widely known in
Y.W.C.A. work. She took an Arts degree at
Adelaide Uni., and gave her whole life to; the
Young Women, getting her training at their institu-
tion in Sydney, and then putting in four years
at Dunedin. Since her return to her home town she
had been secretary to the senior clubs.

Middleton will open in Sydney on June 20 —avail yourself of
the opportunity of hearing this famous Bass-Baritone. His voice is
faultless. It is enriched by freshness and an astounding range.
More than this, Middleton has the power to understand and in-
terpret.
Wherever he sings he is master — concert-platform, opera,
oratorio. But do not take our word for it, hear him yourself—and
read what the critics have to say.
You can hear Middleton’s voice re-created for you at any time
you wish. The humanness of Edison’s invention has astounded
millions; here is no approximation, no mere imitation, but the voice
intact. But you need not take our word for that—come and hear
for yourself.
ARTHUR
MIDDLETON
What is he doing?
He is singing in direct comparison with
Edison s records of his voice and showing
there is no difference between the two. This
is the great TONE-TEST passed triumphantly
by the New Edison more than six thousand
times—and which has yet to be attempted
even once by any make of talking machine —
(they dare not; the travesty would be too
great!).
Edison alone has solved the secret of
how to Re-Create an artist’s voice with such
absolute perfection that his (Edison’s)
Re-Creation cannot be distinguished from the
original.

AVOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Randwick on Saturday wore some notable
furs, and among them the mole cape ot
Timothy Coghlan’s lady earned a special note
of admiration. A brace of viee-rogals were
garnished with aides and grouped about with
society in the bud. Lady de Chair sported
a white waistcoat to her black tailorings,
and the G.-G.’s lady was sombrely topcoated.
In fact, the dressing was so pessimistic that
the gathering resembled the sort ot English
function that gets itself into the latleu
and the Queen. Out of the murk of the
day only one Hallelujah remains, and that is
that, the Australian man still baulks at
spats!
There was a semi-religious atmosphere
about the party at Government House last
Friday owing to boy choristers and anthems
being * the chief entertainment of the night.
The ballroom had been furnished with rows
of high-backed seats swathed in linen, and
into these the guests filed after the hand-
shake, rather in the manner of those enter-
ing a sacred edifice. This feeling was some-
what deepened by a heavy frosting of
clerics, who sat up and beamed like angels
while Frederick Mewton waved the trebles
and the altos to light and shade, just as
though anthems and choir boys were quite
a new experience. Violinist Gerald Walenn s
fiddle and Frederick Mewton in a Chopin
scherzo gave the choir a chance to take a
breath or two before its final outburst in
“Westward Ho to Trinidad!” Then, led
by the vice-regals, everyone joined in a
procession to supper, the Governor-General
looking very dashing in decorations and his
lady very graceful in the softness of geor-
gettes the deep blue of Dutch glazes. Lady
do Chair, who swung a Gaby Deslys fan or
jade green ostrich plumes and wore Aus-
tralian opals flashing iii her hair, was other-
wise a shimmer of silver lame with grace-
ful addenda of silver lace, while daughter
Elaine advocated return to the gold currency
in her frock of gilded lame.
The good-looking Mrs. Bridges, from Eng-
land, who has been catching the Sydney
eye the past six weeks, emerged at this
party Lorelei-like from sea-green georgettes,
while Mrs. Vivers wore her mist-blue frock
very short and weighted its shoulder-drape
with crystal tassels. One lady wore red
berries in her hair and looked like an elfin
creature from a magic oak, and another
wore red berries in her hair and suggested
a plum-pudding. Commodore Wardle brought
his Jean; and official-secretary Harry
Budge and his wife introduced a flapper
daughter to the grown-up world. Judges
and their ladies wore as plentiful as oyster
patties, among them Mrs. Rolin as out-
standing as the unusual pearl in rosy geor-
gette. Mrs. George Earp was there in a frock
so mother-of-pearled she might have been the
Coster Queen; another with a bright inspira-
tion had apparently had her frock nailed
together, every seam and gusset and band
ana the panels that grew between blazing
with steel nailheads. And the Stradbrokes’
heir, Lord Dunwich, was among the male
attractions of the heavily-populated rooms.
Visiting knight Timothy Coghlan and his
lady were the big guns at the Royal Colonial
Institute’s party last week. The lady, who
is always the last word in smartness, wore
an effective kit in browns and blues sugges-
tive of Persia, topped by a black hat, mer-
curial with wings. Clothed in Robin Hood
green and sable, Hugh Denison’s lady passed
on the hands-across-the-sea greeting to Miss
Lintott Taylor from South Africa. Squire
Morgan and Mrs. Lamson (she’s the wife of
Kreisler’s accompanist) colored the after-
noon with music, Squire with his violin and
the lady with a mellow voice very soothing
to the ear.
Once again the Institute of Architects has
hung the galleries of the Education Depart-
ment with blue prints and sketches of homes
and buildings in Sydney as they should be.
Very fascinating, too, are the homey sketches
—almost enough to make even the modern
business woman look with a kindly eye upon
matrimony as a profession. Much cannot
be said in favor of the Sunlight village
modelled and erected by the Uni. School of
Architecture. Separately the houses with
the green shutters are fancy-luring, t but the
way they are grouped under the church-spire
smacks too horribly of the Deserted Village
and the ghoulish children of Wordsworth
who took their little porringers and gobbled
up their supper sitting on small brother s
tombstone. Lady de Chair, w T itli the help of.
Elaine and Captain Coote, opened the ex-
hibition one afternoon last week, and made
a strong appeal for the beauty of simplicity
both in our dwellings here below and in the
memorials we. lift on liigh for those wlio
have joined the heroic dead.
The Junior Red Grosser, strong in the
consciousness of good deeds done, lighted on
the upper part of Phillip-street like a flutter
of white doves on Thursday. Flying the
Crimson Cross of their Crusade as proudly
as ever did Don John of Austria, the small
girls surged and swayed about the footpaths
waiting to form a guard of honor for their be-
loved dame, Professor David’s lady. Within Bt.
James’s Hall were small mountains of their
patience aiid kind thought in the form of
every sort of toy and sweet and garment, all
to be sold or distributed for the happiness
and comfort of the child of the soldier fallen
on evil days. The Exhibition, which is
usually held in the Town Hall, proved a
tight fit for St. James’s, and was only pos-
sible because when the small girl found
herself cramped she ran out of doors and
expanded on the front steps. Lady de Chair
opened the Exhibition, and Judge Rolin also
dropped in and cast an eye over the proceed-
ings. On Friday the G.-G.’s lady called and
made her farewells to the juniors; and on
tne same day Elaine de Chair put her teeth
into the mid-day sandwich.:
A generous heart ceased beating last week-
end when the widow of Thomas Allwright
Dibbs died at her Point Piper home. This
was named Graythwaite after the original
family rooftree, which Mr. and Mrs. Dibbs,
in the early war-days, handed over to the
Red Cross as a home for invalided soldiers.
The lady, who had the old-fashioned name
of Tryphena—she was a Gaden —had filled
her days with good works, .and at one time
was associated with every philanthropic
movement in Sydney. Her husband was
general manager of the Commercial Bank
of Sydney for over 40 years —it was at the
deceased lady’s suggestion that on complet-
ing his GOth year with the bank he handed
the officers’ provident fund a cheque for
£5OOO.
Hugh Dixson, who never forgets the way
to his pocket, has just counted out another
thousand for the Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital. This is to start the fund for an ex-
tension of the Isolation Ward which he gave
the better-baby institution a year or two ago.
At the, yearly talk over the hospital’s affairs
last week, the necessity of this extension was
urged by both the State Ex. and Henry
Braddon. Dalgety’s chief, by the way, always
has an anguished look while listening to
others —the girl in the flat opposite swears
he suffers from ingrowing speeches. But
when his turn came the other day he did
Judge Backhouse proud, telling of 26 years’
hard work the hospital’s former president
has to his credit. Frederick Waley and Dr.
S. 11. MacCulloch flung a few remarks into
the argument; and then everybody strolled
across the street to the nurses’ dining-room
where there was tea flavored with the Police
Band.
The owner of the fine head here repro-
duced by May Moore's camera is Mrs. Sam
Hordern. She
is the mother

tion that is

one of the
widely flung
Booth family,
and in her
girlhood nobody had to ask twice who
the Booths were, for her father’ was one
of the most public-spirited men of his day.

Richards who was Sydney’s first Lord Mayor.
St. James’s blessed an interesting knot-tying
the other day wiien Florence May Jowett
liked up with Cecil Howard Douglas, of the
Eastern Extension Telegraph, Singapore.
The bride, who served all during the war in
spite of twice being mined, wears the Royal
Red Cross, pinned on by the Prince of
Wales. She is the only daughter of the late
padre Jowett, of Sowerby Bridge, Yorkshire,
and a niece of the great Jowett of Oxford.
Bridegroom’s sister, Mrs. Staite, came from
Maoriland to be matron of honor, and
’groom’s mother came from Adelaide to super-
intend the cake-cutting at Paris House.
Zelma Coralie Flitter chose her own parish
church of St. Michael’s, Vaucluse, for her
marriage with Hugh Eldridge Manning.
Ivory georgettes flashing into a silver froth
of train and the softness of Brussels lace
veiling clothed the bride. Sister Sheila
’maided, a touch of Spain in her yellow
moires and yellow 7 roses. Bride’s mother, in
sable velvets and ermine, hostessed the wed-
ding feast at the family home, Westray.
Bridegroom is the only surviving son of the
late Justice Manning.
It is only every now and then a North
Shore lass gets the chance of marrying a
baronet, so there was quite a stir in Gordon
the other night when Georgie Law hied her
to St. Philip’s to say “I w 7 ill” to James
Lionel Broun, Bart., of Colstoun, Gunnedali,
and Coon amble. The bride was silver from
veil to shoes! and clutched a faery bunch ,of
pale pink roses. One full-size bridesmaid
and two in miniature put touches of mauve
and blue into the wedding group.

The Daltons had a wedding in the family
the other day when MJarion, of the Randwick
branch, in the course of a Nuptial Mass be-

There was another crowded night at the
Palais when the ball for Lewisham was
the attraction. Mrs. Tommy Marks was
president of the committee, which included
such consistent workers as Mrs. M. J. Vecch
—she looked after the treasury—and the
V. J. McPhee and H. Daly matrons, who
were the secretaries. The Governor and
Lady de Chair and Elaine came shepherded
by Captain Geoffrey Hughes and Mr
Penfold, and were welcomed by a committee
in which were tangled up Mrs. Tommy

lace, the Major-General Brand couple.

wind from her hair by a judicious mingling

took a stand against sectarianism and flew
orange brocades. But the glory of the
night was the frock crusted with silver and

The Country Women’s Association has
gained a society committee for its dance
during the Dudley Cup Week. The affair
has been christened the Extra Chukka (the
ceremony was carried out in gingerale with
apologies to a .well-known constable), and
will spin merrily to the anthem of eacli of
the 36 polo clubs of the State. The White
Pavilion at the Showground will be the scene
of the revels; and July 18 is the appointed
night.
The English-Speaking Union staged the
biggest meeting of its career the other after-
noon at Farmer’s, when Lady de Chair
addressed the gathering. Her plea for a
better understanding between the English and
the Americans was loudly apnlauded, and
then everybody settled down to tighten up
the bonds over a dish of tea. Henry Brad-
don’s lady and U.S.A. Consul Lawton’s wife
were the afternoon’s hostesses.
R. O. Blackman, who serves in the Bank-
ruptcy Department of the Supreme C ourt
when he isn’t searching for new things to
admire in his Pinero, is going about these
days looking like 30 shillings in the pound.
His Pinero pearls, lately published under
the title of “Enchanted Moments” by Angus
and Robertson, have called forth a loud’
hosanna from the veteran playwright. He
has generously written to Mr. Blackman, on
the front leaf of the author's personal copy
of the collection : “You have made me bank-
rupt in thanks. I owe you so much that I
cannot pay you even at the rate of sixpence
in the pound. I can only subscribe myself
yours till nature grants me my final dis-
charge, Arthur Pinero.”
“Way for the ladies!” is still the King’s
School Old Boys’ motto; so rather than clash
with the girls of Kambala, who are having
their school dance on July 17, the K.0.8.’s
have pushed theirs forward nine days.
All Sydney’s Who’s Who turned up to the
meeting at the Australia the other day in
the interests of the State’s deaf and dumb.
Henry Braddon took the chair, and Chief
Justice Street took another and endorsed
everything the knight had to say. Fifteen
thousand pounds are needed for the estab-
lishment of a home for the group-up suffer-
ers; and the big meeting resolved to throw
all its efforts into making the Mayor-
ess’s fancy fair on August 5 a tremendous
success. Sir Dudley is keenly interested, and
to a. man the Navy is backing the money-
spinner.
Elliott Napier, the lawyer who likes litera-
ture better has put on record the history of
the Sydney Repertory Society in a beauti-
fully printed booklet which comes from the
Green Press. Mr. Napier makes out a
strong case for the Repertorians—stronger
perhaps than many another constant, first-
nighter might; for indeed many of the Syd-
ney Repertory productions have been dull
and dismal and altogether alien to our out-
look. However, there is much to intei*est
find something to instruct in the little work.
Quite a slice of it. is given over to the praises
of Gregan McMahon as producer and actor,
find this Letter thinks highly enough of Mr.
McMahon to agree with 75 p.e. of the eulogy.
But, after all, what Australia really wants
is a society that will fester an Australian
drama. Something of our own by our own.
At the Sign of the Stars—at any rate, it
seemed like that, the automatic climbed such
Himalayan heights—the group of girl- and
boy-artists who call themselves the Atelier
Club foregathered one night last week. They
are mostly students of the Royal Art Society
classes and the studio of Dattilo Rubbo; as
a matter of fact, the clubroom is really that
sparkling little man’s workshop by day. The
feature of the evening was a lecturette on
“The Art of Cezanne” by just-returned
Roland Wakelin. between an. illuminating
prologue and epilogue by Mr. Rubbo.
From Brisbane, a city in the North: —
The ’Varsity has been holding revel. . There was
a garden party with Cumbrae Stewart, in blue, to
introduce the guests. Miss Rogerson, in brown and
fur. and Turner, A.D.0., followed hi 3 Ex. about;
and Mrs. Story, in black marocain, patted the pro-
cession forward on beha.lf of Sir Matthew, who. is
Chancellor. The morality play “Everyman,” pre-
sented by the Uni. Dramatic Society, was part of
the proceedings, and ran to a season of two per-
formances. There was the boatrace, too; and one
of our very coldest nights and the Trocadero were
thoughtfully chosen for the students’ ball. Sir
Frederick Dutton, the Royal Colonial Institute’s pro-
pagandist, was with his Ex. The Uni. colors--
red and blue—and Chinese lanterns cast a glow over
the grey and pale green brocade of Mrs. Thynne.
who stood with her vice-chancellor husband to
receive the guests.
Old English folk songs were a feature of the
Uni. Musical Society’s entertaining in the main
hall. Dailey Scarlett lent a hand, and Sir Matthew
was amongst those who applauded.
The Women grads, had their yearly bone-picking
at the Ritz. Freda Bage (in Japanese satin) pre-
sided. Blue and gold decorated the table, with
venusta in blue bowls.
The Moreton Handicap and Epsom Races brought
out many good lookers and glad raggers. The
golden bignonia and the bright green lawns pro-
vided a harmonious backing to the many shades of
brown. Mrs. Prendergast, of Maoriland, was in
one and Mrs. J. H. Cannan in another. Mrs. Roger
Hartigan chose blue velvet, and Irma Dearden sand
color with furs. Mrs. A. IT. Whittingham displayed
black satin crepe with black-and-white fur. The
after-the-races squashes that Lennon’s saw included
a notable one by the Willie Kents, with decorations
of poinsettia.
T. G. Lahey’s daughter has accepted the usual
token from Alfred Gardner, of Mokanger, Hamilton
(Vic.). The girl’s parents live at Clayfield.
Doris Johns said she would to Arthur Rofe, of
Sydney, at St. Andrew’s, South Brisbane, the Rev\
Arnold tying the knot. A golden wedding bell and
white blossomry did up the church, and the bride
was in ivory velours and trailed a train lined with
pale blue. Mate Johns ’maided in sunset tints and
Eric Rofe best-manned. The bride’s home saw the
after-feasting.
Principal G. C. Lawrence, of the Glennie School,
is retiring. The staff arranged a bumper farewell
in the assembly hall, which was, decorated with
bougainvillea, sweet-pea and Virginia creeper. Elder
pupils brewed the tea.
Federal Attorney-General Groom's mother had a
birthday party earlier this month —she was 86.
Her late husband was Speaker of our Leg. Assembly
no less than 42 years ago. But Toowoqjnba re-
members him even better for his long connection
with the local Chronicle, which is still in the
hands of the family.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Although holds were small at liandwick on
Saturday, the generality of punters could do nothing
right until the last race, in which a short-priced
favorite just got there. Jupiter (7 to 4) failed
them in the Second Hurdle, being outjumped and
outpaced by Piratic (10’s), who, an untrustworthy
brute a couple of seasons ago, is now racing gener-
ously for his feminine owner; and Threeasta (20’s)
gave them a dreadful shock in the Plying Handicap.
The Vic. chestnut (he is a four-year-old gelding by
Three—Shasta) had run last in the June Stakes on
the Monday; here, meeting the same class of horses,
he took the lead early and kept it without difficulty,
being pursued unavailingly by the English mare
Heloise, for whom three-quarters of a mile is
apparently not far enough, Chatterbox (favorite at
4’s) and Loyal Merv, who broke even for third
place. Then Minterne, hot favorite for the A.J.C.
Steeplechase, lost his rider at the third jump. He
had changed hands during the week for the prepos-
terous sum of ■ £3OOO, and the fielders quoted equally
preposterous odds—s to 4 on; his backers would
have got that for first place on the two-divs. machine.
With Minterne out of it, Palbi (4’s), who is
trained by Neil McKenna for J. T. McKenzie, had
onlv to stand up to beat the five tenth-raters opposed
to him, and, though he nearly came down at one
fence, he was merely cantering at the finish, being
followed at long intervals by Mailman, Grand
Urchin and Mumblebone, the other two having
fallen. It was a rotten race for a £2OOO stake,
and the A.J.C., which has been richly endowing
winter steeplechases for several years past,- should
now be convinced that it has been throwing away
good money. Another favorite in Cloud (5 to 2),
to whom his S. Aus. dam Tadanga did not transmit
her speed, was runner-up in the Second Nursery
to Gounod (10’s), and Strongbovv (6 to 4) proved
no match for .Valamita (10’s) in the Winter Stakes,
13 furlongs. ’ The race was run at a slow pace,
which may have suited Valamita more than it
did Strongbow—the electric clock recorded 2min.
551 sec.—but there is no getting away from the
fact that the Valais colt finished strongly and won
well. More than ever he takes the eye as a likely
Metrop. horse, for he is improving with racing, as
a good youngster should. It was Golden Yet (3’s)
who, lightened the bulging bags a bit after the
Exeter Handicap. A three-year-old chestnut gelding
by imported Yetinan —Golden Circle, he is a promis-
ing bit of stuff, but he only headed the unlucky
Gaelic Maid in the last stride.
* * * *
One thing made plain by the racing at
Williamstown on Saturday was that H. E. Connolly
holds a strong National Hurdle hand with Eric the
Red and Sir Charles. Neither is as good as Jack-
staff, who won for Connolly in 1924 —Jaekstaffs are
rare—but both are promising hurdlers and are
favorably handicapped in the Flemington affair to
boot. Sir Charles has won his last two races, and
Eric the Red beat a good field impressively in the
Port Phillip Hurdle. A full brother to Jackstaff,
and a long-striding brown, he was just behind
Autrolite when the latter ran down the last obstacle,
and was going away at the end, the time—3min.
41Jsec. —equalling Jolly Phast’s course record for
the distance, two miles. Clan Robert, who finished
two lengths behind the third horse, Pindarus, was
favorite at 9 to 4 ; Eric’s price was 6’s. Hinsdale,
who rode Eric the Red, was also aboard Valaster
(5 to 2) in the steeple; the Piastre—Valkyrie
gelding led most of the way and came home a
length or so ahead of Governor Gay, with Dundalk'
—favorite at 6 to 4, and finishing stoutly under his
list. 71b.—two lengths away, third. The Point
Cook Handicap, 10 furlongs, produced a pretty race
over the last two furlongs between Dukedom (6 to 4)
and Daflton. The favorite got the judge’s half-neck
verdict, but the flatites lustily disagreed with it.
Dukedom belongs to H. F. Hoysted, who can’t
regret having brought the Duke of Melton—Eunice
gelding to the city.
"Hasen” : It was just after the Lancaster
Handicap at Flemington that 1 met Brent. He was
depressed. He pointed out that the winner, Moneth,
absolutely “stood out.” “Why,” he asked reasonably,
u’ V? n run seconc * to Preposterer (the favorite) at
\\ llliamstown ? And to-day there was a difference
of a stone in its favor. And still I let them put
me off it.” But Brent’s cup of bitterness was not
yet lull, as I discovered when 1 saw him again 10
m \ n ,*^ es a^cr - R he’d been depressed before he was
wildly angry now, and I asked him why. “You
know that fool, S-Simkins?” he stammered. “He
backed M-Moneth ten to one!” “Well,” I said,
he must have more sense than I thought he had."
I knew Simkins, short-sighted and simple and totally
ignoiant of racing matters. “Sense be hanged!”
raged Brent. “I asked him why he’d backed it
and he said a cove in the office had written out some
tips for him. He showed ’em to me. Said he’d
had some trouble in reading them left his glasses
at home. Trouble in reading ’em..,. My God ! The
dam fool had backed Moneth because somebody ’cl
tipped him M-Monvose for the Steeple.” Plainlv.
the cup was now full.
* * . *
The Deacon : What is the greatest dis-
tance a jockey has been thrown from a horse in a
race and survived—or otherwise? Pearce, the
Sydney jockey, was flung 32Aft.—the distance was
measured by the ’stipe—off Tom Raigon, in a hurdle
at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.). And then a water
table pulled him up!
* * * *
“Vedette” : A jockey’s license carries many
pnvileges, but not that of offering a trainer money
to scratch a dangerous candidate from a race in
which the jockey is considerable interested. That
is what brought about the downfall of Hector Gray,
the crack M.L. horseman. According to, liis own
story, he wanted the dangerous candidate’s jockey, to
vide las own good thing (eventually beaten) because
lie could not himself get the leg-up. As the race
was run last November, the delayed action of those
in authority is remarkable, especially as the matter
was reported forthwith by the owner most concerned.
In the end, the Canterbury District committee took
action at the instance of a racecourse inspector.
Gray was haled before them, admitted the offence,
asked for leniency and was warned off for ever.

The Australasian Waterloo Cup meeting
lasted three days, and hundreds of car parties mad’
the trip to Rooty Hill (N.S.W.) each day. The
brothers Carter collected the Cup per medium of
Terminus (N.S.W.), who won each course with
points yto spare. Versed (N.S.W.), runner-up to
Terminus, could offer only feeble opposition in the
deciding course on account of a broken toe. Fluid
was injected into the injured member, a proceeding
which started a controversy of which the last has
not been heard. The Carters and Keighey and
Bateman, owners of Versed, are publicans, and each
backed his hound substantially. Samuel Hordern
gave his recently imported Drummock a run, but
the stranger, after winning one course, was beaten
by Red Dennis (Vic.), the best-conditioned dog at
the meeting—his owner got third money.
* * * *
“R.H.”: A peculiar psychology is that of
the greyhound. Perhaps one in too woum oiuiply
murder a bulldog; the other 99 would have no more
stomach for a fight than a consumptive rabbit.
But let a hare get up. Bruised feet; bleeding toe
nails and weariness are instantly forgotten—at nearly
40 m.p.h. they dash to the chase. Bambalina, the
diminutive winner of the Metropolitan Stakes at
Liverpool (N.SAV.), is a case in point. With a
piece of loose hide flapping like a torn yacht sail
from her near hind leg, she limped on to the ground.
Owing to her stiffness, she was as slow from slips
as a punctured caterpillar. But as she warmed up
she gathered way like a locomotive, passed her
opponents as if they were going the other way,
reached the Imre lengths in front of everything, and
TICH WILSON, crack Melbourne jockey.
never looked like losing. Hares were the best I’ve
seen. Having only 39 on the ground to decide a 60-
odd course meeting, the club took special pains to
train them. Some reached the escapes without being
turned, and the whole 39 emerged safely from the
seemingly unequal battle of shiftiness against superior
speed.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Reference to the old-time
Glasgow ironmasters, Baird and Merry (B. 4/6/’25), re-
calls another of many yarns concerning these brethren
in industry and sport. The pair had a famous badger-
drawing dog, and made a match for £lOO a side with
the owners of an Edinbro’ tyke. The draw was
fixed for neutral ground at Linlithgow, the arrange-
ment being that the side not ready to start at 3 p.m.
should forfeit the stake. At the eleventh hour, some-
thing happened to the Glasgow dog. Baird wanted
to pay forfeit, for a trip to Linlithgow meant a
heavy and expensive lunch and dinner, for whicn
the losers would have to pay, in addition to losing
the stake. Merry scouted the idea, and putting
their dog in a travelling box the pair went to
Linlithgow, leaving the dog box at the station.
The other side asked at lunch where the Glasgow
dog was. Merry produced the station parcels receipt
for “box containing one dog.” Edinbro’ hinted at
calling off the match, then offered 4125, and, at
last, £5O forfeit. Baird was eager to close, but
Merry was adamant. “Ye’re a hard man, James,"
said the Edinburgh leader. “Weel,” said James,
generously. “Ah 11 let ye off: gie us se’nty-five pun,
pay for thae train tickets and this lunch an’ we’ll
ea’ quits.” “Dune,” the other replied. “But we
beat ye after a’, Jamie; our tyke’s broken a leg.”
“Dod, an' A’m no that sure,” said Merry, pouching
the forfeit: “Ye see, oor tyke’s deid.”

Starting in his first cross-country race,
J. H. Newman, who competed at Paris last year,
not only won the five miles junior teams’ race at
Caulfield, but clipped 22sec. off the record (28min.
44sec.) established by G. It. Hyde in 1923. There
were 200 starters, and Whittle, a young Ballarat
harrier, was second, with Newland, like Newman
a member of the St. Stephen’s club, third.
Vaughan, a Manly youngster who showed promising
form last year, landed the N.S.W. five-mile cross-
country championship at Rose Bay. He led for
most of the rough journey, and had 6see. to spare
at the finish. M. McWilliam (Lidcombe) and J.
Sheaves (Wests), were nearest to him. Vaughan’s
time was 30min. 50sec. There were 68 competitors.
Before A 1 Ivarasick (list. 111 b.) and
Walter Miller (list. 81b.) began wrestling at the
Melbourne Stadium on Saturday, Walter was ordered
by the referee to wipe his head, which looked too
oily. It proved to be the only incident of the evening
that momentarily promised any excitement, for
Miller protested and showed temper when he was
overborne. In the grappling he demonstrated that
he knew a great deal too much for the Russian “lion,”
and his points victory was the only possible decision
There, were no falls. If the bottom has not fallen
out of the wrestling “boom” this dreary performance
was enough to mak" it one vart hole.
• * * *
Albert Lloyd (13st. 2 A lb.), who has been
boxing for nearly as many years as “Blackie”
Miller (I3st. 3jlb.) has lived, whipped the former
naval blacksmith in 20 dull rounds at the Brisbane
Stadium on Saturday. The match was for some
championship or other—of Coorparoo, perhaps.
The ’Varsity team looks like collecting
senior tennis honors in Melbourne this season. With
M.C.C. weakened by the absence of Gerald Patterson,
and Geelong without Hawkes, the field is clear for
the Uni. four, though Malvern has a strong “A”
team again. The ’Varsity selectors are having a
lot of trouble in deciding who is to stand down
each Saturday, for there are lan Mclnnes, of Davis
Cup fame (he is the captain) ; H. F. C. Hallowes, the
Trinity returned-soldier, who has been with the
team since 1922 : Haege, junior champion of the
State; Turner, junior champion in 1923 and 1924 ;
and Coldham, who has been Australasian junior
champion for the last two years. Three of the
five players come from Trinity.
“Shrewsbury”: The score of 315 put up
by Holmes, of Yorkshire, at Lords is the largest
ever made on the historic ground. One would have
expected that the headquarters of cricket would boas:
the ideal cricket pitch, but as far as batsmen are
concerned this is not the case. That exceedingly
rare bird in modern cricket, the shooter, was often
to be found at Lords, even well into the twentieth
century, and still occurs at unexpected moments.
The slight slope of the ground which helped so
much the bowlers who had studied its vagaries has
always been a hoodoo to visiting batsmen; the late
J. T. Heaina was a past master of its possibilities.
Something in the turf of the old market garden has
also favored the bowler, arid the huge scores
familiar on the Oval and on the Hove at Brighton
have never been a feature of Lords. “W.G.” has
laid it down that a century at Lords is worth two
made elsewhere.

In Saturday’s Melbourne League matches
shocks were administered to teams which think no
end of themselves. The despised St. Hilda, which
had, on King’s Birthday, handed Essendon its first
—and a solid —defeat, continued the good work by
walking all over Collingwood. The Saints’ marking
and kicking were superb, and they ended with 76
points to ’Wood’s 40. Similarly, Melbourne pursued the
even tenor of its bogging in while the great Fitzroy
stood still and wondered. Just before the close
the board said that the Red Legs owned 12 goals to
’Roy’s 3. The Maroons rushed on three more before
the bell rang, so things looked a little less awful,
but the result was: Melbourne 83 points, ’Roy 45.
The contemned Carlton Blues, with a solitary win
to their credit, made common pussies of the Richmond
Tigers—66 points to 43. Essendon, after leading
South Melbourne throughout, had a fit of cold
shivers in the last quarter as the Southerners steadily
reduced their leeway from 25 to 8 points. Then
the bell saved ’Don—6s to 57. Geelong, on its
own dunghill, had little difficulty in demolishing
Hawthorn—lol points to 49 ; and North Melbourne
administered the customary trouncing to Footscrav,
now at the foot of the ladder, by 78 points to 54.
“Wink”; “Flipper” Thorp, Richmond’s full-back,
is a survivor from the days when the Tigers domi-
nated the Asspciation, and when Port Melbourne-
chased Richmond and all its supporters ffo the city
in the riot that followed “Knobbo” Knox’s successful
assault on the field of Richmond’s (and Australia’s)
champion bruiser, Bill Lang. “Flip” has guarded
the goalposts for 15 years. Still he has a long way
to go to equal “Chinga” Harris’s 19 years in goal
for Footscray, and “Chinga” doesn’t hold the League
record for long service. That is divided by Henry
Young, of Geelong, and Billy Windley, of Stoush
Melbourne—2o years on the ball. ‘ The Aussie
record is claimed in his home town for “Dolly”
Christie, who started in Ballarat and battled on with
many teams in three States—Westralia at the finish
—for 22 years.

The opening match between Maoriland and
N S. Wales, at the Sydney Agricultural Ground,
saw the local men beaten 26 —3, after it had been
3—3 at half-time. Defeat was not unexpected by the
critics, for the new local back division was admittedly
experimental—-it included only the living Crossman
of the seven who last year helped to lick the
1924 All Blacks, victorious everywhere else—■ but no
one thought the margin would be so wide. The
debacle resembled that suffered last season by ta
A>.\\. League XIII v. Queensland, and was due to
s ?, n L e «P aus f —the weakness of the inside backs,
the A.S.W. forwards bore all the burden of the
day and were knocked out before the finish. Tlitv
gave their backs the ball from the scrum, and
barring their apparently ineradicable tendency to
pick up in the rucks, instead of keeping the ball at
foot, played a worthy part. The veteran Humphries,
behind the Blue scrum, battled bravely against the
weight of years. Rainbow, at five-eighth. Anderson, of
Kurri lvurri, at inside centre, and Tobv, out-ode
centre, were the weak spots. The tackling of the
insides was lamentable, and time and again in the
second half the Black flood poured through the gap.
Crossman never got a chance all day, but Bowers,
on the Blue right wing, ran and tackled in fine
fashion till he went off injured. The star of the
backs was the ex-Grammar boy Ross, who made a
splendid first appearance at full-back, his catching,
line-kicking and tackling being well up to inter-
national form. He lacks Nothling’s pace for running
his backs into position, but made a better show-
ing than the M.L.
crack, Harris. The
All Black forwards
are true to type, and
Finlayson, an untiring
giant with a rare
capacity for dribbling,
stood out on the day,
though Donald, the
wing- forward skipper,
was conspicuous. L.
Johnson, one of the
stand-off halves, domi-
nated the inside back
play, while Wise and
Elvey, on the wings,
proved resolute run-
ners. At least one
centre, a five-eighth
and a scrum-half of
class will have to be
rooted out somewhere
if N. S. Wales is go-
ing to keep up its
record of the past
two seasons.
McKenzie,
the M.L. team’s
manager.
The chances are that the Sydney League
premiership will be fought out by South "and North
Sydney, with indications favoring South. < n Satur-
day, North beat Balmain by 9 points to 8. Herman
Peters, North’s centre threequarter, playing a great
part in the victory. For some reason or other, Peters
has been left out of the State XIII. and his ex-
clusion is unpopualr. Latta, the best forward in
the League, made splendid efforts to save his side.
South Sydney had a picnic (31 to 3) against Glebe.
Lapham getting four tries and Wearing a try and
four goals. The latter easily leads the point-scorers
for the season, with 50 in six matches. Eastern
Suburbs dished Newtown, 9 to 5, and St. George
downed University, 16 to 10.
The faint hope that the English Soccer
players might meet their Waterloo at Newcastle,
where the very babies know all about the offside
rules, was dashed on Saturday, when the coalies
were wiped out by 6 goals to 1. The crowd was so
huge that the game had to be stopped at times to
clear the playing area, and the teams were unable
to reach the pavilion at half-time. The imperturb-
able Britons scored steadily right through, being
4 up at the interval: they thoroughly enjoyed the
sloppy ground. Batten, Hannaford and Simms shared
the goals for England. Newcastle had a slice of bad
luck in losing Maunders, the N.S.W. and Australian
forward, who was injured against the visitors in
Melbourne.

“Hamer”: Sporting popularity was a fac-
tor in the election of G. J. Tuckett for the Northern
Province of Vic. Leg. Council. Tuckett played foot-
ball in his younger days and was secretary also of
the Kaarimba dub. To-day, although he has ex-
changed booting the leather for bowls, lie is a
member of every sporting body in his district and
an official of many of them. Just how much that
mattered is shown by one of the election appeals on
his behalf —“Help to kick a goal for Tuckett.”
O’Halloran, K.C., deputy chairman of X.A.
Football League during the absence of McLaehlan in
England, has had the unique task of censuring a
whole club and fining it 10 guineas for “having
misled the League by presenting wrong dates, in
order to obtain a clearance from Tasmania of the
player Lee before he was entitled to such clearance.”
Lee was a West Adelaide member who went to the
Speck last season and came back this year.
“Rio” Anyone wishing to judge flic com-
parative usefulness of club and military rifle-shooting
is recommended to study the Sydney Sunday, papers
of June 7. On the previous day, while the clubs
were using their ammunition in the same old delib-
erate shots at the same old black bull’s-eye on a white
target, with sighters, out-of-date rifles, uon-servke
sights and other appurtenances, the trainees were
doing something really useful. In the Villers-
Bretonneux match for Vickers machine-guns, 30
rounds in 20 seconds, the 30th Battalion team put
every shot into the target. For Lewis guns, 15
rounds in 20 seconds, Sgt. Oldish and CpJ. Derhani.
of the 2nd Div. Engineers, dropped only one point.
Then came the Mont St. Quentin, seven rounds, no
6ighters, at a small tinhat target exposed for three
seconds each shot. In this, no fewer than four
trainees got the possible. The last event was the
Lagnicourt. Competitors stood with empty rifles
until the command “Rapid-fire” ; then they loaded
and fired as many rounds as possible in one minute
at a small tinhat target 3C>oyds. away. The winner
scored 71, which means that he averaged more
than 14 bullets through the enemy's head in one
minute. Compare this with the Randwick club’s
match, also at 300yds.: 14 shots in two lots of
seven each, with two sighters, and probably over a
minute for each round. The top score was 67.
BALLADE OF THE UNBREAKABLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Although the winning combination, Pildin and
Palbi, was reputed to have taken thousands out of
the ring at Randwick on Saturday, most of the book-
makers reported a satisfactory day.”
Three conditions at least before
Life you have lived to the full you’ll know,
Namely, poverty, love and war.
There is a proverb that tells us so.
But only two are for Iky Mo.
That’s how he differs from other folk.
Punters’ winnings may lome and go
But when did you hear of a book being broke ?
Love he may sense to his inmost core,
Feel with its passion his frame aglow,
Even as Abelard thrilled of yore
When he was Heloise’s beau.
Amorous sonnets and warm rondeaux
In Cupid’s service he may invoke
After the favorite’s overthrow.
But who ever heard of a book going broke?
Din of battle? Who hears it more
Than he who faces the swarming foe
Veiling his slogan of six to four
With grim defiance at high and low,
Challenging ever .fortissimo,
Giving or dodging the shrewdest stroke
With never a yellow streak to show
Of a dismal terror of being broke?
Envoy.
Zest of combat, love’s bliss (and woe),
These he may share with the av’rage bloke,
But never the pinching lack of dough.
Who ever heard of a book being broke ?

Premier Collier, of Westralia, is still in
London, while his deputy, Angwin, keeps the
Red-spotted Flag flying at Perth. Whether
Collier is on a borrowing tour or simply im-
proving his mind is uncertain. The last
heard of him was that he had engaged a
British Engineer-in-Cliief for his State at a
salary of £2500 per annum, and it is certain
that that won’t improve his popularity.
There is a practical look about the Japan-
ese method of eradicating the opium evil in
Formosa. That colony in 1900 had 109,004
addicts, all of whom were registered. By
1921 this figure had been reduced by death
to 45 800, and as no new permits are issued
and the mortality amongst devotees is four
times the normal, it is reckoned that by 1930
the opium smokers will have smoked them-
selves away. This seems better than total
prohibition, which makes people who would
otherwise never have worried about the drug
strain every nerve to come by it.
The bitterest pill George Fuller had to
swallow after the first figures had been
announced in the Ma State elections was
the taking of second place to a gassy coal-
miner who a few years ago worked in a
local nit. During the campaign the Premier
more than once asked what William Davies,
who had only been 13 years in the country,
knew about Wollongong that he, George
Fuller, born in the electorate, didn’t know.
But hewers of coal are mostly cosmopolitans,
and the Wollondilly miners even passed by
Davies’s Australian-born colleague, Andy
Lysaght, to plump for the Welshman.
“U.P.”: This has been a great year for
mushrooms, the rain coming just at a time
when the ground was warm and the fungi
germinated quickly. In the Port Fairy and
Oressy districts of Victoria one small family
made a profit of £lOO in a week collecting
and marketing the goods. Two Port Fairy
fishermen filled 53 cases and sold them for
15s. each. They decided mushrooms were
more profitable than mullet. The appetising
fruits of the field came to Adelaide in dray-
loads, and the market was glutted for a time.
The best were procurable at 6d. a lb. and
poorer grades at 3d. and 4d.
Vic. civil service has at least one member
in the Melbourne Club —Mahony of the Geo-
logical Branch of tins Mines Department.
Needless to say, he has worldly substance
other than his salary. When William Hohen-
zollern ran amok in 1914 Mahony caught
the next boat, obtained a commission in a
British regiment, took a hand in the scrim-
mage, and earned a couple of pips. The rea-
son he didn’t join up in Australia was that
he wanted to redeem an unwritten compact
to fight with English ’Varsity mates. He
was the man who declined to get excited over
the Nieholson-street, Carlton, gold-find, and
with cold facts froze a threatened boom.
“Munjong”: The attempts made lately to
commercialise stringybark fibre suggest that
there are also decided possibilities in several
other Australian tree-fibres. In this respect
the baobab of the North should be worth
investigation. Though I have not heard of
laboratory experiments being made, I know
that in certain localities Binglii uses and
appreciates it. He, or rather she, since the
gins do all the work, extracts the fibre in the
usual primitive fashion by soaking and
pounding strips of the wood. This stuff
bleaches snow-white in the sun, and is then
worked up into very strong and attractive-
looking twine. I have seen fishing-lines, nets
and dilly-bags made of it.
Taken the count, under the N.S.W. age-
limit regulations, G. PI. Tolley, one of this
country’s foremost authorities on irrigation
and water conservation. Born in Vic., his
first experience in irrigation work was with
the co. which carried out the Mildura scheme
in the ’eighties. Subsequently he became
assistant-sec. to the Mildura Irrigation Co.,
later joining, as secretary the Trust which
took over the work.- Arthur Griffith, when
N.S.W. Works Minister, brought him in to
lay out the settlement at Yanco, and 12 years
ago he was promoted to the Water and Irri-
gation Commission. His work has won him
a wide fame abroad, where, like many other
brilliant Australians, he is better known than
in his own country.
“Troophorse”: Recently some fishermen
up north caught 150 feet of shark in 71
hours’ fishing, for a wager made with a local
bookmaker. They won the bet easily, and
returned the “dead narks” to a watery grave,
thus providing food for their mates. The
shark-fishing industry in Australia is in a
very poor way, only a few pounds of fins
being shipped to China in a year. Why it
should be so beats me, as there is a profitable
living to be made from the game. Shark-
fins are in demand as food by Orientals,
who use them chiefly for making soup.
Fins are classed as either white or black,
though none are perfectly either. They are
divided into several groups of different
values. The chief commercial classes are:
white spotted (boon leong) , graded into
large and small white fins ; large white fin
(chu) ; small white fins (peh and Main) :
large black fin ( tua) ; small black fin (oh
and seow oh) ; small black-tipped fin (oh
1m). In preparing them for market they
are merely cut from the shark, the cut
being well salted or dusted with lime and
dried in the sun.
“Centurion”: Charles Alfred Percy Gar-
diner, just acquitted in London of a charge of
fraud, has had varied experiences since he
left Australia in 1901 with the stli Vic. Con-
tingent for South Africa. The recent charge
against him rose out of his activities as an
agent for Abdul Krim, the Riff leader, and
his defence was chiefly a recital of his ser-
vices to the Empire. These included the
plans for the raid on Zeebrugge, the inven-
tion of anti-torpedo devices, the salving of
the Oceanic and a lot of other picturesque
stunts, including the recovery of treasure
from the ancient wreck of the British frigate
Lutine off the coast of Holland. Also, he
claimed to have commanded a regiment of
Australian Bushmen in S’Africa. A brass-hat
from the Admiralty testified as to Gardiner’s
“valuable services” to his country, and the
jury acquitted him without more ado. As far
as S’Africa went, Gardiner ended up as a
captain in the sth V. 1.8., a brother officer
being Lieut. Maygar, V.C., who was killed
by an aeroplane bomb at Beersheba while
commanding the Bth L.H. One wonders how
many more Australian Dugnld Dalgettys are
giving Abdul Krim a hand.

Evidences of a boycott or lockout of vil-
lains on the modein stage arc accumulating.
At one time it was possible to recognise the
elegant scoundrel who , wrecks happy homes
the moment he set his cloven hoof upon the
stage. He was always dark and usually a
count. “Bought and Paid For,” at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday, included a villain;
but this Page only located him after fruit-
lessly watching Fred Coape, the Japanese
valet, through the first act, and Rosamonde
MacMillan, the French maid, half-way
through the second. It is the crapulous
habits of Frank Harvey, an American mil-
lionaire,-which wreck his domestic relations
with Muriel Starr. A perfectly decent chap
when he is . sober, he becomes a libidinous
tyrant when drunk, and his young wife, not
being versed in the strategy of dealing with
intoxicated husbands, refuses to take more
champagne with him, but reads him a lec-
ture instead. When he breaks into her bed-
room for the nth time, she decides to return
to the lowly life of a telephone-girl, from
which, after a suitable interval, he rescues
her again. The disadvantages of giving the
role of villain to an abstraction arc here
glaringly manifest. The audience has to take
for granted the fact of Frank Harvey’s re-
pentance and the permanence of his resolu-
tion to drink no more; the old-fashioned vil-
lain would have been liorse-whipped or flung
with fine dramatic finality into the nearest
pond. #
Nevertheless, the play gave Muriel Starr
the opportunity of playing on her one-stop
reed of persecuted woman shaken by sobs,
“THE LADY.” AT MELBOURNE
ROYAL.
Pauline Frederick as the tearful Polly Pearl,
music-hall star, 1898 vintage. George
Barraud as Leonard St. Aubyns, the
bounder who marries her.
though an excursion into the higher registers
at intervals would have improved matters.
Frank Harvey was a better Hornblower,
self-made millionaire, than Robert Stafford,
hereditary scion of the same species: a ten-
dency to pose was manifest, except in the
well-acted boozequinade in the second act.
John and Jessie Page, as the mar-
ried couple who share the telephone-girl s ups
and downs and her final re-elevation, pro-
vided excellent comedy, the lady in particu-
lar striking the right note of a vulgar but
good-hearted creature who makes the best of
fortune’s capers, whether they bring bread
and margarine or pearl necklaces.
The commercial duel between Gappy
Ricks, of the Blue Star, and his prospective
son-in-law, Mat. Peasley, of the Red Dia-
mond. continues to be waged nightly at
Sydney Palace.
“Kid Boots” will be pulled off twinkling
feet at Her Majesty’s after next week, and
go back to the lowest shelf m the wardrobe.

“The Lady of the Rose” still walks in

She will be on view and in earshot for an-

Jazz bands and eccentric dancers were
pushed aside when a quintette of stars of
other days, “The Veterans of Variety,” made
their first Sydney appearance at Fullers
last Saturday before a wildly enthusiastic
audience. The popular melodies of a quarter
of a century ago were sung by the five old-
timers, Jake Friedman, Arthur Slater.
George Campbell, Florence Hinton and Lily
Burnard—in some instances by the artists
who started them on their long journey. The
choruses of such old favorites as “After the
Ball,” “Oh, Mr. Porter, What a Silly Girl!”
and “Daisy, Daisy, Give Me
Your Answer, Do,” were sung
by the veterans, the words being
flashed on to a screen. Old
Alhambra patrons must have
had a thrill when George Camp-
bell let loose “The Man Who
Broke the Bank at Monte
Carlo” or when Lily Burnard
rendered her very own “Two
Little Girls in Blue.” Florence
Hinton’s “Good-bye, Mignon-
ette,” rescued from the lumber-
rooms of the past, and the
clowning and yodelling of Jake
Friedman afforded an interest-
ing contrast of the old with the
new It was ridiculous to
speak of the superiority of one over the
other: they embody the spirit, of two
totally different ages, so far as mental
outlook goes, and it is no reflection on them
to say that the old-time airs, for all their
quaintness, would become very tiresome to-
day if laid on too thick.
After what happened last week, Wee
Georgie Wood is finished with the fair sex
and has joined a gang of youthful despe-
radoes at Sydney Tivoli. As the leader of
the Blackliand gang, the pocket-edition com-
edian is a provocative little mischief-maker,
and so true is his realism that stern fathers
itch to lay him across their knees. His two
offsiders, Dolly Harmer and Tom Black-
wood, give him splendid assistance. Another
interesting item is the “Peep Into a Broad-
casting Station”; and Marie Lawton sings
Tosti’s “Good-bye” and Gounod’s “Ave
Maria” to the accompaniment of the harp,
and does it like an angel.
The little orphan who flourishes a dishrag
and smashes the crockery at Sydney Lyceum
is Colleen Moore, playing the name-part in
“Sally.” a movie version of the musical
comedy that .Tosie Melville made famous here.
Colleen is a more biosterous Sally and lacks
the gentle winsomeness of our Josie, but a
little exaggeration on the comedy side is pre-
ferable to melancholy close-ups of a female
with glycerine tears streaming down her dial.

A notable one-man show:—
The everlasting quarrel between Ormuzd and
Ahriman, gods of light and darkness, are the theme
of all John D. Moore’s remarkable pictures at
present on show at the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney.
The squabble in the tempestuous skies is repeated on
the earth; but the artist’s skilful brush weaves the
tangled argument into vivid and arresting compo-
sitions. Lady Butler never painted a more exciting
battle scene than “Chaos” (No. 1), a view of
agitated house-roofs and fort-like gasworks, with
telegraph poles waving like banners in between, in
Nos. 6 and 15, views of the Sydney Show Ground,
the same conflict is proceeding above the heads of
the indifferent multitude holiday-making down below.
Even his bowls of flowers he flings into the con-
troversy, making a still-life study as willing as a
pothouse brawl; and in his quieter pictures the
warring deities are present, brooding on their arms.
Moore is a valiant adventurer. He prefers to tackle
a medley of trunks (No. 14) rather than a single
tree; and with it all he presents, in some lovely
passages in paint, a new but eminently truthful
vision of the Australian scene.

The push of a strong committee has re-
sulted in very good attendances for the Doro-
thea Spinney season at the Melbourne Assem-
bly Hall; and the audiences have been given
every reason to feel satisfied with their enter-
tainment. It is a rather constrained audi-
ence which attends nightly, obviously bound
by a feeling that it would not be quite the
thing to introduce here the levity of
applause; the bottled enthusiasm comes only
when the elocutionist has reached a pause
between acts, or has finished. Miss
Spinney has a nicely modulated voice, very
clear in its enunciation ; and after a concise
and clean-cut introduction, explaining the
origin and circumstances of the drama, she
represents the various characters, as she
speaks the dialogue, in a manner which
makes each one vivid to the listener. She
takes the Gilbert Murray translations of
Euripides for her recitals; they are full of
sonorous phrases in which the spirit and
language of the Greek author are well pre-
served ; and of these passages the elocution-
ist makes all that can be made. But a weak-
ness—it is that of the translator —lies in the
effort to maintain the work of the Chorus in
English rhyme, which frequently cheapens

shows under sentence. To-morrow (Friday)

show will bloom for only six nights after
that. “Whirled Into Happiness” is its suc-

For the tail-end of the John D. O’Hara
Melbourne Athenaeum season, the bright
“Laughter of Fools” is to be given a revival
on Saturday (20th inst.). It must be a
very short revival, for Lee White and Clay
Smith are due at the dainty theatre on
July 4.
“On Our Selection” continues to stir
laughter at Melbourne King’s. It is an
advertisement for the appeal of the Austra-
lian play that, at a period when theatrical
business is slack, the piece which has had in-
numerable revivals during the last 14 years
can still draw good houses —the best in
Melbourne at present.

The Versatile Three, who have attained
that kind of popularity at Melbourne Tivoli
which takes the form of shouted requests
from the audience for favorite numbers, wall
fade away at the end of this week: they
beat the dexterous Felovis, with his excep-
tionally good balancing tricks, and the
juvenile Traps, with his accumulation of
noisy instruments, for the heavyweight
applause. The programme is well balanced ;
the worst that might be said of it is that
the bitterness of Jack Stocks against women
is a trifle worn and a little extra speed might
be got into the Monkey Circus act—some of
the specialists seem to have been listening to
Tom Walsh.
There is probably no entertainer in Aus-
tralia who can fall on his ear as naturally
as George Wallace, who this w r eek has
changed his Melbourne bill at the Bijou to
i “Harmony Row.” Wallace is a versatile
comedian, but that trick of falling on his
ear and slithering along the stage on the
organ of hearing is his masterpiece. Huley
and Bent, moderate funmakers, and sou-
brette Lena Jooste are the most notable of
the other additions to the programme.

“Salvation Hunters” and “The Price of
Pleasure” share honors at Hoyt’s de Luxe
in Melbourne. In the latter picture, Virginia
Valli has a week’s adventure with a young
millionaire, who, of course, learns that he
wants her for more than a week. “The
Sunshine Trail” is a bright, breezy offering
at the Majestic, and “Flying Finance” and
“The Average Woman” fill out the pro
gramme.

A Melbourne show with spots on it:—
A show of unequal values is made at the Decora-
tion Gallery by James Swinten-Diston. in a good
many of the 40 water-colors the artist has lost the
freshness which ought to be the charm of water-
color by overworking his medium ; and some of his
trees are more wooden even than trees should be.
The artist obviously also is held by English con-
vention in his painting- of atmosphere, and fails to
visualise Australian color. “A Sunrise Near War-
burtou'’ (No. 15) and “Ketches, Hobson’s Ray,” are
amongst the most appealing of a collection which
shows craftsmanship battling hard with the faults
indicated.
“If I Marry Again,” at Adelaide York, is
a well-built picture made to appeal to the
great heart of the American working-girl
who dreams of marrying a millionaire’s son
and then having to defy the old man.
“North of ,°>o,” at Wondergraph, is very
American, too, reviving the days of long-horn
steers and Indian raids. So are the two
pictures at the l’av., ranging from a sand-
storm in Texas to the streets of New York.
At West’s, on the other hand, Johnny llines
is strongest on the comic side. Stiffy and
Mo are at the Majestic; also June Mills,
who makes capital of her weight, and the
brothers Foy, clever horizontal-bar workers.
That the Boucicault Co. did not take all
Adelaide’s theatre-money is proved by the
packed houses G. B. Post gets at the Itoyal.
The improbable story of John Cliilcotc and
his masquerading double is strongly pre-
sented. Winnington Barnes, as the old ser-
vant, is especially good.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: A story of purposes as
tangled as any that playwright has used for
farce-comedy is connected with the one visit
which Edwin Booth made to Australia. The
American arranged to bring Laura Keene
with him, but at the eleventh hour she posi-
tively declined to go. As a result, the vessel
which was to take the actor was held up, and
the skipper, whose wife had been an actress
but was keeping a waterfront boarding-house,
rushed ashore, got her to sell up, and
smuggled her aboard. Satisfied that Laura

would remain behind, he reckoned that, in a
land where actresses were scarce, his wife
would be sure of the vacant “shop.” A
similar idea struck a Mr. Evans, who secretly
stowed his wife on board —at least, he said
she was his wife. But when the ship was
well at sea, and the two ladies appeared on
deck, they found Laura Keene there, too.
She had changed her mind, as Lauras do.

“Neebsah”: “C.K.’s” par. (B. 14/5/'25)
about Trebelli’s ability to sing any mezzo-
soprano or contralto role in grand opera
reminds me that the lady went a notch be-
yond this. One night at Newcastle-on-Tyne,
when she and her tenor husband (Bettini)
were with the Mapleson co., it was an-
nounced that, owing to the sudden indisposi-
tion of Bettini, Trebelli would undertake the
tenor part—and she did. Trebelli was
French. She got her captivating stage-name
by reversing her real name—Gillebert —and
dropping the G.
“Dalba”: Krcisler’s visit calls to mind
Ella Caspers, whose wonderful contralto
voice threatened to give Australia another
world-wide advt. Ella returned from a
triumphant London season to sandwich in a
Sydney season and a visit to her people be-
fore she went on tour through Europe with
Kreisler. She was booked to leave by the
Seidlitz to fulfil her engagement the week
the Great War broke out. Ella Caspers
did what little concert and touring work was
offering here during war days, and then mar-
ried. She is living a quiet, domesticated
life at Taree (N.S.W.) as the wife of Mr.
Maloney, a dentist. She still warms the
hearts and delights the ears of townsfolk
occasionally.
“Cwrw Bach”: Allan Wilkie’s triumphal
progress in Brisbane has been definitely
checked. The following motion has been
adopted by disapproving trade-union ladies
at Brisbane Trades Hall: —
This meeting of the Woman Workers’ Organisation,
while recognising the dramatic talent displayed bv
ihe Allan Wilkie co., regrets that, so much ability
should be devoted to in-tilling into the children’s
minds the old military dope, which is quite out of
touch with modern idealism.
The reference is to the Wilkie co.’s represen-
tation of “Henry V.” And no doubt the next
step will be to declare Shakspeare “black.”
“C.K.": “Goody” (G. L. Goodman) will
always be affectionately remembered by
everyone who bad any relations with him,
business or social, and by no one more so
than by us “imported” performers. J.C.W.
said to me when I reached Adelaide in '9B:
“If you want anything in Sydney go to
‘Goody.’ ” It was he who smoothed the path,
explained differences and removed difficulties.
Surely there has been no more lovable char-
acter in Australian theatrical history.
“Demetrius”: Who says the Australian
has no reverence in his soul? At the ump-
teenth revival of “On Our Selection” I poked
mild fun at its obvious melodramaticisms,
only to be chided by a serious acquaintance.
“Why, man,” he said with an undernote
of horror in his voice, “the show’s been run-
ning, off and on, for 14 years!” Evidently
replay that remains a commercial draw’ for
14 years has reached a stage when it be-
comes hallow’ed, tried in the box-office and
not found wanting. I see in this the rise
in Australia of an inspired literature —a
Rig-Veda or Zend-Avesta—-with “On Our
Selection” its Old Testament and “The Sen-
timental Bloke” its New.
“X.N.0.”: The report that the Lords of
the Admiralty refused to allow the heroine
of the naval film “Sons of the Sea” to be
photographed on board the hero’s ship at
Malta, because her appearance on board
would “be contrary to discipline,” reminds
me. Cholera was raging at Malta in 1911,
and the fleet was sent to Corfu until the
danger was past. An officer in the battle-
ship Duncan w’rote a musical play for pro-
duction on board, and three English girls
who were appearing at the Corfu music-hall
promised to take part. The fleet was ordered
back to Malta before the show could be pro-
duced in Corfu waters. Put on in Malta,
with the three girls in the cast, it filled the
big Opera House for seven nights. How’ the
ladies got there is a mystery to this day, as
there is no steamer service from Corfu to
Malta. Possibly they travelled in the Dun-
can, but that w r ould have been “contrary to
discipline,” and discipline is a great matter,
as everyone knows.
“L.H.P.”: The Hollywood version of
“Decameron Nights” recalls Australian pro-
ductions of Yon Suppe’s opera of “Boc-
caccio.” Dunning and Wallace's co. did the
thing really well at Melbourne Opera House
in September, 1882, with Kate Chard in the
title-role, Annette Ivanov as Fiametta,
Knight Aston as Leonetto, Mows. Loredan
as Pietro, T. B. Appleby as the olive-grower,
and Johnny Wallace as the cooper. When
the co. toured Maoriland, George Dean —
still on deck, and with a pretty daughter
also in the business—was the cooper, and
there were other changes in the cast. In
1897 the Pollards revived the opera, with
Maud Beatty in the title-role, sister May
(shortly to be married again) as Peronella,
Alf Stephens as Pietro, Harry Quealy as
the cooper, Billy Percy as the olive-grower,
Charlie Albert as the barber, Marion Mit-
chell as Fiametta, and Emily Metcalfe as
Isabella. It was the small role of Beatrice
that first brought Florence Young before the
public in the George Musgrove production
at Melbourne Opera House in September of
1889. Nellie Stewart and Marion Burton
alternated the title-role. Emelie Melville
was another notable “Boccaccio” at the old
York-street (Sydney) Opera House in 1884.
The man who was to play the cooper in
this production took ill, and Johnny O’Neill
went on in the part at three hours’ notice.
“Topee”: Yes, the real gallery has gone
(B. 4/6/’25), and with it the “slips.” These
in the old English theatres were two side
galleries above the main one, whence came
salvos of orange-peel, nutshells and
“pigeons”—paper-darts which, if skilfully
launched, would circle three or four times
round the theatre before burying themselves
in the chignons of ladies in the stalls. Noted
hecklers were generally voted to the end

money — an' she ain't got none.”
seats overhanging the stage, and any alter-
cation between actors and gods was audible
all over the house. Few old players could
be baited into replying to ribald criticism
from above, but on one historic occasion
George Grossmith, the elder, shouted angrily,
“You think you're mighty funny up there,
don’t you?” “Well, it's a blanky sight more
than you are down there!” came at once
from the o.p. side.
“Hamfat”: “The Lady” gives Pauline
Frederick a chance to show that she can
sing, but surely Polly Peach would not
warble “In the Good Old Summer-time” for
the delectation of visitors to a Marseilles
wine-cellar in 1898. That ditty came to Aus-
tralia with the Stine and Evans co.
in 1903; and I don’t think it was five
years old then. Though the song made a
hit the Stine and Evans co. got into such a
bad way during its stay at the Sydney Cri-
terion that an appeal had to be made to
the American community to keep it off the
rocks. The Yanks rallied nobly, but there
were too few of them to save the ship.
“S.T.S.” : Stage directions, as given nowa-
days in the elaborate manner meant for
reader rather than actor, are quite interest-
ing. For originality I should back one in
the new volume of Cosmo Hamilton’s plays.
At the climax of the big scene in “Scandal,”
where the hero ’asserts his rights in private
over the girl w T ho has called him her hus-
band in public, the heroine is directed by the
author to get into bed “with the air of a
brave but conquered enemy.”
COLLATERAL.
FIRST CHORUS : “ He's a serious-minded kid.
Always tells me I ought to be putting
something away for a rainy day.”
SECOND CHORUS: “Well, aren't yon saving
his letters?”
“Middle Blue”: Linda Foy had to work
hard for the opportunity which she has
turned to such good account in “The Lady
of the Rose.” I recall her as a kid Juliet
in one of Kay Souper’s recitals. Then she
w'as one of the bright “Blue Bird” young-
sters when Gertie Cremer was Tyltyl.
Nowadays, having arrived, she owns a race-
horse.
“G.J.W.”: Wilkie, 0.8. E., made his first
appearance in Australia as a member of
George Marlow’s Sliakspearean co. at Mel-
bourne Princess’s in January, 1916. He
continued with the co. until Marlow sold
bis interests to the Fullers and George
Tallis. Jean Robertson, the Portia to Mos-
covitch’s Shylock, also became known to Aus-
tralians in a George Marlow co.—she sup-
ported Ethel Buckley—and so, by the same
token, did Nellie Bramley, Louise Lovely and
Vera Spaull.
“F.A.”: “The Devil’s Disciple,” which has
been revived in .Sydney, was the incipient
effort of the old Sydney Repertory Society
that began its brief career in 1912. The
play was staged at the Rep. Theatre, Gros-
vonor-street, and the cast comprised G. Kay
Souper as General Burgoyne, Herbert
Bentley (“Bunny” of Julius Knight’s
“Baffles”) as Dick Dudgeon, Sydney Stir-
ling as the husband, Aggie Thorn as the wife,
and the writer as the Sergeant. Alt’ Hill
supplied the music, Les Casey was stage-
manager, and D. 11. Souter gave Les hints
about the mounting. Very well mounted
the thing was, and the thunderous prompt-
ings now so prevalent at these shows were
absent. Nevertheless three nights of dimin-
ishing audiences was the extent of the season,
and the society turned up its toes soon after.
“T. 0.1.”: A friend has lent me a copy of
W. M. Akhurst’s “The House that Jack
P.flilt,” a “fairy extravaganza” produced at
the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, in December,
1869, under the management of Harwood,
Stewart, Hennings and Ooppin. Maggie
Stewart appeared as Little Victoria, and
Nellie Stewaft was also in the cast as a tiny
dancer, though not mentioned in the book.
Nellie is the only survivor of the production.
Akhurst was on the Argus as sub-editor and
musical critic; later he joined the Herald
and Bell’s Life. He wrote 14 pantomimes
in Australia- —one, “The Siege of Troy,” ran
60 nights—and others after his return to
England in 1870. He died on board the
ship Patriarch while on his way to
Sydney, where his sons were in business, on
June 7, 1878. and was buried at sea.
“Gan”: Trousers are sometimes a source
of anxiety on the stage. Once the inside
seam of a famous actor’s trousers began to
rip, and the gap spread so rapidly in full
view of the audience that the curtain had to
be rung down. When it rose again the star
appeared in sounder garments, but his first
words of dialogue nearly brought the curtain
down again. “Something terrible has just
happened to me.” But it is just as bad when
the. curtain won’t come down. At an ama-
teur show’ in Melbourne the ending of a
polite farce left the chief character in the
embarrassing situation of being about to take
off his trousers. Everything w’orked up to this
grand climax, but when the comedian got
ready for action there was no curtain. He
was left helpless while the audience screamed
with delight. The “rag” simply would not
come down.
“W.E.J.”: Another Australian in a Broad-
way show (B. 30/4/’25) is Boland Hogue,
w hose late dad was once a Ma State Cabinet
Minister; he has a part in “Sky High.” A
year or two ago he was brought, back to his
native State to play in musical comedy, but
his only appearance in Sydney was made in
a gore-freezer, “The Bat.” It is a long cry
from musical comedy to bellowdrama of that
sort, but anything may happen to an Aus-
tralian actor in his own country.
“L.E.”: People who hold that the public
is always the best judge of the merits of a
play will have something to ponder over in
the astounding success of “Abie’s Irish Rose.”
As a money-spinner it lias easily broken the
record; “East Lynne,” “Charley’s Aunt,”
“Camille” and other old favorites are failures
by comparison. “Abie’s Irish Rose” began
its long-distance run in New York, May, ’2B,
and is still going strong, while other com-
panies are presenting the masterpiece all
over the States. It made a bad start, but
the author, a lady, who is also the producer,
had faith as well as dollars, and kept serving
it up till people got used to it, with the
result that she has refused a million dollars
for the picture rights alone. It has mild
Kosher jokes, obvious Hibernian jokes, and
a “get together” moral, the climax being the
arrival of twins to Rose and Abie.
A show of applied art: —
There are no indications in this year’s display of
the N. S. Wales Institute ot Architects at the Educa-
tion Gallery that Australia has yet evolved a
national architecture. She had an opportunity once
when the imported Georgian began to develop into
the Old Colonial type, but the architects went off
after the strange gods of California and the chance
was lost. A bit of lovely flotsam from the period
still lies stranded on the cliff at Kirribilli, and
there are odd examples struggling in the flood of
“bungalows” and chalets that quarrel with each
other in the suburbs.
A good instance of the prevailing anarchy is
the large model, designed by graduates of
the University under the direction of Mr.
McCredie, of a community village, complete with
all the concomitants of an Australian township, in-
cluding a Chinese market-gardener. The houses are
Georgian, but they surround a square whose centre
is occupied by a camel’s-back bridge. The British
people have been noted builders of bridges in
their day, and it is strange that Australian students
should have to go to Peking for inspiration now.
Business premises in reinforced concrete are the
main expression of an industrial age, but there are
only a few examples in this show. Brisbane, where
a measure of success in adapting structures to the
torrid zone has been achieved, has sent some
interesting specimens. What Sydney will look
like in a few years’ time, when the Harbor Bridge
and the City Railway have taken shape, is illus-
trated in some admirable pictures; and K. H. Mc-
Connel, Joseland, Gilling, George ltae and others
show the political caravenserai at Canberra in ornate
designs. Sydney will have a worthy southern gate-
way when the Anzac memorial designed by Norman
Weekes is put in place, although the Greek columns
placed across the thoroughfare suggest the supports
to an invisible temple rather than the entrance
to a city. A lack of courage in using anthro-
pomorphic motives in memorials is indicated in the
new rage for tablets, pylons and cenotaphs instead
of statuary. There are Australian sculptors, here
and abroad, well able to undo the hideous errors
in taste displayed in the past embellishment of our
public places; but most of them have to resort
to designing lamp-shades in order to earn a crust.
A restful dwelling with a prim English air of
peace is the cottage designed by Oscar Beattie,
which owes much of its charm to the pollarded
gum-trees that have been thoughtfully preserved.
And one by the camera-main—
The exhibition of the N. S. Wales Photographic
Society at Harrington’s, Sydney, suggests that the
temperamental person is apt to display more courage
when he has a camera in his hand than when he
waves a brush in the face of Nature. Some recent
shows of paintings have conveyed the impression that
most of the exhibitors went out with the same teacher
and squatted down in front of the same tree and cow
In this camera show there is quite remarkable variety,
and that the effects obtained are not all accidental
is shown by the well-marked evidences of individual
style in many of the panels. Oazneaux has man-
nerisms of his own, and in addition to some sound
portraits has made a fine landscape out of un-
promising materials in No. 19. Monte Luke knows
what he -is doing, and no artist has got the spirit
of Australian scenery better than Geo. Potter in
No. 80, “On the Road to Jamberoo,” from which
the color is scarcely missed. But it is work like
Arthur Smith’s which should stimulate the artists
to leave their rut. Here are the chaotic growth
and movement, and the exotic charm of mpdern
Bagdad by the Harbor portrayed in monotone;
the country awaits an O. Henry of the palette to put
the color in.
MORALS AND AN EDUCATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The majority of pictures teach a great, moral and
are an education to those who can properly interpret
them.” —Miss June Elvidge.
In twilit hall, where music softly sobbed, \
A Super-Plus-Pluperfect Film I saw.
It told of one who neatly schemed and robbed,
A crook who broke ’most every man-made law
And all of God’s. Red anger through me throbbed
At this too-callous rogue; I prayed his end
Might be a fit and sticky one. But no!
With but a hundred feet or less to mend
The ill he’d revelled in through reels of woe,
He picked the safe (at that he knew no peers),
Rescued the banker’s missing babe, and so
Married his fairest daughter, amid cheers.
The moral here’s as clear as crystal water—
No fate’s too bad for any banker’s daughter!
Then “Pulsing Passion” was the film displayed,
While fiddles shrieked, and wailed the saxophone ;
In next-to-nothing drapery arrayed
The Flaming Flappers came into their own.
By evening-suited satyrs undismayed,
They gaily jazzed up to the brink of sin,
Or even, borne upon a cocktail tide,
Perhaps—just now and then —they tumbled in.
A tear they shed (a few more clothes beside),
And soon were dancing to the same morass,
For well they knew, whatever might betide,
Some picture-hero yet would save a lass.
This moral, too, is moderately plain:
Just go your hardest, girls, then go again 1
And last a comedy to close the show,
Most “strange, eventful history” of all,
With bricks and bombs tossed gaily to anl fro,
And men that run and in their running fall;
And bathing beauties in a luscious row,
And bolting motor-cars and maddened trams,
Policemen, monkeys, clergymen, a dog,
Untoothed old men and babies in their prams,
Whitewash in buckets, soot, a slimy bog—
All these and more in one astounding whirl,
With this clear fact emerging from the fog,
The funny man at last does kiss the girl.
An education! Aye. but I’ll admit
I lack, alas, the skill t’ interpret it.

PERPETUAL FORESTS LIMITED
Please send me your free booklet on Afforestation.
Name
Address.
ONE issue of a leading New York daily re-
presents the destruction of from 60 to 80
acres of forest. Consider the yearly consumption
of forest by this paper alone. Further consider
the countless thousands of newspapers of the
combined countries of the world and the enorm-
ous destruction of forest required to feed them.
By their magnitude alone the resulting figures would be startling.
Their real significance, however, is uncovered by the fact that
only 5 per cent, of the world’s forest consumption is being re-
placed by afforestation. Experts consider a timber famine
inevitable within 15 years.
The N.Z. Perpetual Forests is an afforestation project formed
on co-operative lines. It offers you the opportunity to make
£5OO from £25 invested
£25 will purchase you the yield of one acre of scientifically af-
forested land in the Thermal Regions of New Zealand (part
of 50,000 acres being planted). After heavily discounting aver
age figures and assuming that only 500 out of 680 trees mature,
and that the price obtained is only £2 per tree, a return of
£5OO is assured.

project.

Miss Robertson thoroughly believes in the
use of pure mercolized wax for the com-
plexion Unlike face creams, this harm-
less wax performs a double action. It
both peels and preserves the skin. It
gently peels off only the worn-out waste
matter and then it perpetually protects
and preserves the fresh complexion thus
revealed. No wonder women are aban-
doning face creams in favour of such a
truly, wonderful preparation. Ask any
chemist for a package of Dearborn’s

Sea Wanderer: Fair work spoiled by the
tags you’ve had to run in to make your lines
scan. Of course all poets have to do that; but
some of them can make you forget it.... Stan T.:
Hopeless. Your ear is all out of tune. “Grass”
won't rhyme with “last,” nor “intellect” with
“speck”—but there are nearly a dozen of them....
Peat lope P.: You’re very young yet, aren’t you?
Vour verse is, at any rate. .. .C'.K.A.-C.: Quite
good in some spots. Quite poor in others... .Door
Knocker; Not an idea in it that hasn’t been worn
thin; and it’s not written as though you really
knew much about it McC.R.: “Shades” not up
to the level of the others....M.M.: Your ear isn’t
very good—“dawn”-“niorn” and “noon”-“tune” are
poor rhymes... .W.J.A.; Dull stuff, chiefly because
you’ve raked the dictionary for prosy polysyllables
....Constance; Go on. But don’t hope for print for
two or three years... .W.E.R.: Gets prosy and too
commonplace now and then. It might be worth
some elbow-grease... .0.0.0.; No gleam there....
W. 8.; The matter was discussed at great length a
few months ago, and wc can’t spare space for an
encore yet.... Sylvester; You use the term “pine”
too loosely Trooper 926: An old friend Joan
H.: “Reality” has merit; but the conclusion is weak.
.... K. Khan: Pipped on the post.... Bellerive: We
like the almost Oriental philosophy of it. And yet
there is good red blood in it, too: —
Sc holarly critics are paid
For their literary part;
In the lottery of chance
I staked my art.
In business success
Or for genius’ renown,
’Tis struggle and cling
Or you’re sure to go down.
Fame like the rose
Is guarded by thorns;
A laugh for the merry
Is the poet who mourns.
I never let slatings
Upon my mind prey ;
They’d hurt at the time,
But melteth away.
Endowered with the gift
Since I was a Boy
Made me realise ’twould
Be hard to Destroy.
.... A.C.W.: Hardly enough interest in the easy
catalogue.... R.C.: “Danny” wants prating through
the mill again... .Wilstae: Go on writing and tear-
ing up for a few years, and then let’s hear again.
You’ve got nothing to say yet.... L.8.F.: Doesn’t
run smoothly enough for that sort of thing....
Gordon Ilwa: Too trivial; and verse of that kind
should have more rhymes than that.... J. 8.8.: Too
mysterious. And the picture is not sharp.... J.U.:
Plenty such material in the Divorce Court... .M.F.:
No space for conundrums... .H.P.8.: “White
Feather” motive has been done to death.... H.W.:
Dramatic, but needs more skilful handling....
A.M.8.: Too much “under the influence”... .S.W.S.:
Your staccato music makes a poor tune... .K.C.H.:
Soap incident doesn’t wash... .R.R.: No cake with
your cup... .L.L.; Albert restored to y0u....F.K.:
Too gruesome for the fireside H.M.U.: Tired of
sexual jazz tunes... .C.H.M.; Your doctor has not
qualified.... J.M.V.: Well told, but better for
medical reviews—it is said that they occasionally
deal in fiction... .Askarri; Don’t see any new point
to it....Wawh: The third verse spoils “Movie.”
Something in the same spirit as the rest would serve
better.... Les H. R.: The form is all right; but the
thought is moth-eaten... .Ripponlea: You touch the
spot this time:—
When ’tis frosty, then my blanky
Chilblains nearly send me cranky.
Little imps do dance and mingle
AVhere th’ rosy skin doth tingle;
They stick their pitchforks, sharp as razors,
Where my tootsies itch like blazes.
Every night my toes endure a
Steeping in hot aqua pura.
All my comfort and goodwill wanes
When I start to feel my chilblains.
When she sees I’m all but insane
My mother says, as she brings the henbane,
“Let me put this on- —-don’t sing out.
Do sit still. ’Twill take the sting out.”
’ My Life is very pleasant till pains
Start to irritate my chilblains.
. ...H.T.: Graphic, but insufficient as a story....
Australian Cit: Now get off those verbal stilts,
cut out the “time is on the wing” and “Rip Van
Winkle” and “the handwriting on the wall,” etc.,
etc., and say in plain words what the industry’s
trouble is and what you want... .H.G.U: Interesting
as an incident, but not suitable for use in that
form... .M.L.L.: No room for the cave woman....
M.M.; Your squib is a dud.... L.L.: The Derelict
is down and 0ut.... Tarwoona: Rather long-drawn-
out. .. .Michael O’n: “Coombe” didn’t get hold of us.
.... Julia G. L.: There is music in it; but ir
doesn’t make much of an appeal in Australia....
A.G.K.: By no means. The Bulletin has to turn
down heaps of stuff that is quite good enough to
print. In fact, acres of stuff that it has had to
decline is printed elsewhere... .Winnie: Frankly,
they are both poor ; “Fancies” is the more hopeful
of the two, and it is stodgy commonplace... .M.S.:
“Ballade” goes lame too often... .W.D.T.: The
verse shows weak treatment of an old idea. The
prose piece has no point worth mentioning....
K.N.C.: Quite hopeless... .Paule D.: Lines like
“sweet essence of rhythmic movement she” fall in
on the song like a million bricks.... W.L.D.: Both
just lacked the little distinctive something that
would have saved them.... Frances G.: Your ear is
sadly out of tune.... Eggo: Too many words....
Ril: Cheer up; we’re tired of drab endings....
M.W.: Too slight.... 8.T.H.: You move along like
a hamstrung mastodon.... Raymond: Condense it
into a Poverty Point par. and try then Butten:
“Reprieve” has dramatic quality; but the idea is
frayed.... Dave Rover: Hardly.... Poi: Miles and
miles away... .Gigadibs: Hope you will; your chief
trouble is carelessness.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.C.N.: Two of the field got home, but only just.
Stick to your present line and learn anatomy....
A. 8.: No points about them W.T.: Not bad for
12; try again at 21 A.Z.; Pity your humor isn’t
as fresh as your females... .E.T.: It may not be
a copy of Richard Doyle, deceased, but it has the
ill-luck to look like 0ne....M.5.: Well, the disease
will spread no further. .. .A.S.P.: The gag dragged
it under J.T.: The false-teeth quip has already
been made about glass eyes, wooden legs and
brassieres... .M. 8.: Don’t like labels attached to
people R.M.Z.: A prophecy that requires a lead
ing article to explain it isn’t a fit subject for
pictorial illustration.... C. Y.; Can’t see a picture
in it.... Curlew: Acceptable as an idea—there’s
always a market here for ideas that will illustrate.

“Sucre”: “Hop Scrub’s” alleged cotton-
picking record (B. 21/5/’25) is no such
thing. Two girls at Prairie station (C.Q.)
in 1923 stripped 17001 b. of “snow” from
cotton-shrubs in 54 working days. One of
V-Yi same stuffed 2131 b. of cotton in her
duly-bag in one day. Her pay-envelope
opened up to the tune of f(3. None the less,

O.F. : In B. 14/5/’25 I read a note on
the bad old days of Broome in which
Phoney ’ speaks of the dishonesty of the
shell-opener. Pearl stealing is carried on
to-day quite as extensively as it was in the
old days. Having been connected with the
business since 1891 I have experience to go
on. 1 could also relate dozens of instances
where the thief has fallen in through his dis-
honesty. In one case a shell-opener who had
found a tine pearl showed it to two men
who dealt in “snides.” They persuaded
him to let them have it to sell,
and promised to give him the proceeds less
their commission. They sold it for £2000;
but when he asked for his whack of the
proceeds, he was politely told to go to Hades.
Had he played the game and given up the
P6hrl to his employer he would have received
1200 commission.

“Borom”: In most of the Australian States
the law stipulates that Uncle shall only be
allowed to keep out of the proceeds of the
sale of an expired pledge sufficient to repay him
the principal advanced plus interest. If any
balance remains, it must be shown on the
pawnbroker’s books, which are open to in-
spection by the holder of the ticket, and
must be returned on demand to such holder.
The three-ball fraternity must hold large
sums, to which they have no legal right, for
tt IT ovision 011 e fhat: is little known to
Uncle s patrons. A diamond ring worth £25,
i realise no more than about
£l9. Yet, it the pledge is allowed to expire,
eon rU rf would Pretty sure to bring about
£39. it the interest amounts to £3 this would
leave a balance of something like £6 or £7,
and thousands of similar transactions must
take place every month.

i-, ' 'l'lje Darling Downs (Q.) seem
likely to produce all the Commonwealth’s
canary-seed. The war made it difficult to
import the seed, much of which had come
from lurkey, and high prices induced Downs
farmers to plant extensively after hostilities
ceased. Sydney and Melbourne merchants,
however, being unaware of this, continued to
import large parcels, and could not take over
the local crop when ripe. A voluntary pool
was formed to cope with the situation, but
was unable to sell, and it took two years to
dispose of the 2100 tons. Nevertheless, the
tact was brought home to southern mer-
chants that their own country can produce
seed equal to the best imported, and it is
unlikely that they will again look outside
.Bananaland for their supplies. So long as it
is not over-produced, canary-seed is a most
profitable crop, yielding a lialf-ton to the acre,
which at the present price is worth £4l 10s
a ton o.r. Toowoomba for graded seed. The
seed is used solely for caged birds, and Aus-
tralia s consumption of approximately 800
tons a year at present prices would be worth
about £02,000 to growers. This year the
Downs have produced about enough to supply
Australia, and practically no foreign seed
has been imported.
<<T * * * *
Jesmond”: Phillip Island (Vic.), per-
haps the principal chicory-growing district in
Australia and certainly the pioneer, has been
hard hit. During the boom years the price
ot kiln-dried chicory rose to over £BO a ton;
now parcels of last year’s crop cannot find
buyers at £l;> to £2O. Even £2O may seem a high
price, but it takes one man most of his time
to clean four or five acres, and the yield is
rarely more, and usually less, than two tons
to the acre. Two or three extra men have
to be put on at harvesting time—chicory has
to be dug, topped and washed before carting
to the kiln—-and the price of drying is now
to a ton. lhese expenses, with bags, freight
commission, etc., make a monstrous hole in
the growers cheque. Phillip Island thought
the consumption of coffee would increase
when the boys came back from the war, as it
certainly increased while there were thou-
sands ot men in camp here; but the islanders
at r? 0t tast< L tlie st . nff ladled out to the
A.i n. as coffee, which was calculated to
make plenty of them swear off the beverage
for life. Though the law allows only a cer-
tain percentage of chicory in coffee it is a
mistake to class it as an adulterant. Some
people think it improves the flavor, and it
has considerable food value, as well as tonic
qualities.

“Borom”: What can be done with the
aid of a properly-constructed tariff is demon-
strated by the chemical dye industry in the
United States. A little more than ten years
ago America imported practically all her
dyes from Germany, their annual value being
somewhere about £17,000,000. Later came
the war, and all over the country there
sprang up dyeworks. Some of them were
pretty bad, but others turned out a gradu-
ally improving product, and through the
efforts of these the industry was established.
When peace returned Congress enacted a
tariff high enough to keep out the imports
from the German factories when they started
work again, a marked contrast to what hap-
pened in this country, where the dye-industry
that was born during the war-years was
promptly exterminated by the flood of Ger-
man and other imports which entered the
country almost as soon as the war was over.
The value of the U.S. industry last year was
nearly £24,000.000. Had the same assist-
ance been received by the few factories in
the Commonwealth, there is not a doubt that
they would have increased in number, and
to-day have been a most valuable asset, cap-
able of being expanded to provide the Com-
monwealth with at least some of the muni-
tions that it will need so vitally if it ever
becomes involved in war. In the modern
economic scheme a country’s most valuable
industrial possessions, next after its iron
and steel works, are its dye factories.

SUPERB QUALITY
Australian-made
ENTREE DISH
Only £2/2/-
When inspection reveals the outstanding merits of these Entree
Dishes, the question naturally arises how they can be sold at
such low price. We arranged with the Australian manufacturer
to give a very laj-ge order on condition that this dish should be
made to our specifications at a special price.
The silver, deposited on the highest-grade white metal, is excep-
tionaliy heavy, at least twice as much as is usually found on
similar-priced dishes. They are hard-soldered throughout and
cannot be harmed by heat. The design, with end handles, permits
the cover to be used as a separate dish when required.
In short, they are the best value offered in years.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The consumption of cigars in the Commonwealth
had dropped from 70,000,000 in 1913 to 27,000,000
in 1924. Owing to the prohibitive cost working-
men were no longer able to brighten up the week-end
by smoking cigars.”— Mr. Kir wan, President Ciyar
Trades Union, before the Tariff Board.
Five days, being a bloke
That yackers for hire,
Contented 1 smoke
A clay or a briar
Or pull at a threepenny corn-cob, maybe, with
approval entire.
With a pick in your fist
Or a pinchbar to swing,
The blackest of twist
Is an excellent thing:
You envy not Percy his “gaspers” ; you wouldn’t swap
smokes with the King.
Your labors between,
When with Kelly you swipe,
The humblest “dudeen”
With gusto you’ll gripe
In your lips, but for brightening a week-end—well,
it takes something more than a pipe.
You feel hardly O.K.
For the holiday route
Where the fee-uld they lay
Or the bladder they boot
Without something more toney to bite on, if it’s
only a modest cheroot.
How full and how fair
Life seemed in the day
When the worker could wear
At pastime or play
In his kisser a Flor de Cabasser, a joy, that was
cheap at a tray.
The quiet of the tomb
Sunday brings iii its pack.
Can you lighten the gloom
Or demolish the black
When the veriest bundle of spinach is priced in the
pubs at a zack?
Is there virtue in fags ?
Can a “bulldog” enthral
In the leisure that lags
And the minutes that crawl
Sans Saturday’s solace and soother of Sabbaths thxt
sadden and pall ?
Up, up with the dirge
Anear and afar,
’Tis keen as the urge
Of the moth for the star,
The wail of the woebegone w-age-plug bereft of hi,
week-end cigar!
N.S.W.
T. THE R.
Dr. E. J. Stuckey, who goes as one of the
six Australian delegates to the Pan-Pacific
Conference, is a member of a S. Australian
family which has represented culchaw in
Adelaide for three generations. It provided
the first Australian to become Senior
Wrangler at Cambridge. Dr. Stuckey him-
self has been for 19 years a missionary in
China—it is hardly realised how conspicu-
ously the representatives of this country are
showing up in that field.
“lan C.”: While a covey of Vic. State
members were inspecting the nurseries and
forestry school at Creswick, one of the oldest
of the Parliamentary hands recalled John
Gavan Duffy’s witty comment on a slip of
Governor Talbot’s, made when opening a
session. Instead of announcing that a bill
would be introduced for the conservation of
forests, his Ex. said that it would be for
the “conversation” of forests; whereupon
the ex-member for Dalliousie remarked: “Ah,
the Government is going to put tongues
in trees, books in the running brooks, ser-
mons in stones and good in everything.” Tom
Bent, who was in power at the time, said
his Ministry was quite equal to doing it all.
“H.H.”: A Melbourne newsboy has
found the uses of advertisement less benefi-
cial than most people think them. A press-
man, noticing the boy’s habit of leaving his
papers on the pavement for customers to
help themselves in his absence, asked if it
wasn’t a bit dangerous, and received in re-
turn the assurance that nobody ever took
a paper without leaving the money for it.
The item was duly published. The next
morning the confident young newsvendor was
full of wrath and bitterness. The paragraph
had done its work, and several of his papers
had been “lifted” by mean characters, who,
hearing for the first time of this cheap way
of getting the morning’s news, had failed
to leave a corresponding weight of coppers.
“Jesmond”: During an affray at South
Melbourne the other Saturday night a police-
man only escaped serious injury (he had
already been felled with his own baton)
through the help of a one-legged man who,
supporting himself on one crutch, used the
other with such effect that two men were
knocked out and the rest ran. It is by no
means the first lesson Melbourne roughs have
had in the effectiveness of the crutch. In
Little Collins-street on Armistice Day (1918)
I saw a half-sozzled Digger make short work
of five assailants. With sweeping strokes
of his crutch he knocked down four of them ;
the fifth crouched and closed in, but the
soldier shortened his weapon and jabbed him
in the stomach. As the mair crumpled like
tissue-paper, the victor spat scornfully, and
departed, looking for more patriotic pub-
licans.
From a Professor of Languages in an Im-
perial College in pre-Bolshy Russia to a cocky
in Bananaland was merely one of the long
steps taken by Henry Tardent, nowadays a
consistent prizewinner of essay competitions
all over the Commonwealth. Tardent, whose
face contradicts his 73 years, was born in
a French-speaking canton in Switzerland,
and in his youth crossed and recrossed the
frontiers of nearly every European country.
Thirty years before Lenin ran amok he had
a premonition of revolution in the land of
the Czar, and shifting himself here made
such a success of growing pumpkins that
Queensland gave him the job of running ex-
periment farms at Westbrook and Biggen-
den. Resigning, he made a bid but missed
being elected as a Laborite for Burnett.
Since then he has taken to writing for the
papers and producing pamphlets on rural
topics for the Government. His published
works include a “Life and Poetry of George
Essex Evans” and “Australia’s Contribution
to the World War”—the proceeds from the
latter going to the widows and orphans of
Diggers. Three of his sons served in the
Great War.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LKNOW not where it came from. Twas
among
The retail groceries that I found it
first;
And my dulled soul lit on it. As a flower
' May beckon to a butterfly athirst,
The concrete to mirage appeared to pass
While I was drinking in the scent ot grass.
Does memory store perfumes as it k?eps
Old music and old words ? Or did an
Thresh some far paddock for its frail bouque
Where sped-association pictures finds
And sets ajar the heart-doors mystery,
With one slim blade of grass to trick the k.j .
I took my parcels. I went forth again
into the sunlit street. A swirl of dust—
Scraps of torn paper dancing on the keit>-
Grim pavements kept the green benea
earth’s crust! . .
Only the ghosts of grass could wander here
Where open bar-rooms smelled ot long-spilled
beer.
A woman passing clouded for a space
The air with violet powders, or the reek
Of lavender and musk obscured a whirl
Of hot humanity, horse-flesh and leek
From some bright barrow heaped with
market stuff, . .
Where ripe tomatoes lent unripe their blun.
The clinging scent of petrol and cheese.
Wet paint and ether from the dentist s
room —
All these had some foundation; not the grass
Now redolent of clover heads abloom.
A moment, and I saw the tall pine-tree
Like a dark flame betwixt me and the sea.
I lay face down upon a fresh-clipt lawn ,
I played at ambush with the mounds ot
hay;
I saw the sunlight redden on a sail —
A single moth-wing in an azure bay.
What matter scratches on the bare brown
knees
When gallant life provides such mummeries!
Childhood finds wonders in the new-mown
grass—
The cricket pitch, the football field, the
race
Down by the river, or, on August nights ;
(The ’possum black across the full moons
face),
The running home, keen set upon a meal,
When frost has crisped the herbage under
heel!
Bushfires that through the dry grass curled
and crept,
A yellow serpent, on the Horseshoe plain ;
Stumps smouldering like rubies in the. dark
Or the low paddocks flooded after rain,
While here and there, amid the starved white
bones,
Sprang the green feed that, all too late,
atones!
So I went shopping to the grocery,
Returning with my basket of good things—
More things than I had pencilled on my list;
For who goes forth to purchase squandered
Springs?
I think the .friendly pixies saw me pass
And scythed in Fairyland a swathe of grass!
Against the plump red packages of tea,
Between the spice and sugar, lay the stook.
These fairy gifts weigh less than thistledown
And they are bought with laughter or a
look;
For only those with nothing [ in the hand
Go marketing by day in Fairyland!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
A Continued Problem.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
U T SUPPOSE,” said Belltrees, “it was
your evidence which determined the
verdict of accidental death brought
in at the Coroner’s court yesterday?”
The distinguished psycho-analyst and
neuropath nodded. “There was no other
verdict possible,” he said.
The two physicians sat silent, smoking.
They were friends of that close and rare in-
timacy in which companionship is more
satisfying in silence than in speech. But
Dr. Belltrees felt that in connection with
the tragic ending of Jack and Kate Harbord
there was something more to be told than
Sir John Ancus had told at the inquest.
Finally lie said so.
“I have no morbid curiosity,” he explained,
“but I have a hunch that you did not see
fit to tell the whole truth.” ,
“I told all that it was necessary for tne
law to know. But you are right; there was
something more which did bear profoundly
upon the tragedy. I excluded this from my
evidence deliberately, but you shall hear it
because it is of immense scientific or super-
scientific interest concerning this world, and
the next—perhaps.”
Belltrees smiled. Since, years ago, his
friend had been attracted by the bearing of
the mind upon the body in health and dis-
ease, he had noticed his gradual orientation
from a once definite agnosticism towards be-
lief in a spiritual world —to himself a guess
unproven and unprovable.
Sir John noticed his companion’s smile.
“I said ‘perhaps,’ you remember, W e have
discussed our differences often. You think a
chemist some day will make life in a tube.
I agree with the greatest of chemists, Berthe-
lot, that man will never make homunculus.
But a question of more moment is whether
individual life persists. You know Kate
Harbord’s history?”
“Not well,” Belltrees replied. I know
she was a widow when Harbord married
her.” ,
“Yes,” Sir John said. “I happen to have
known her all her life. When I was a
young man I assisted to bring her into the
world from which last week I saw her dis-
appear. When she married Harry Glover,
a little more than three years ago, I was
present at the wedding.” _■ ,
“I remember now. Wasn’t Harbord a
partner with Glover in a real-estate busi-
ness?”
“Yes. They were remarkably capable
young fellows of the type who start business
on a shoestring in a suburb and then move
their headquarters to Pitt-street, acquiring
wealth in a few years by processes mysteri-
ous to us professionals. But Harbord and
Glover got what they won legitimately.
Glover and Ivate Harbord, she was then
Kate Long, met at a Town Hall ball, fell
in love immediately, danced together all
night, became engaged after the last dance
and were married twenty-four hours after-
wards. Do you believe in love?”
“As an intense sexual affinity between in-
dividuals I do,” Belltrees replied.
“Sexual it must necessarily be,” said his
friend, “but in the passion between these two
young people there was present not merely
a physical attraction but one of mind and
spirit, a marriage of beings in which each
was the perfect complement of the other.
It was a marvellous mating such as the
world seldom sees, although it reads about
it often enough in books of romance.”
“Yes,” said Belltrees, “and we read often
enough in the book of life that this superior
brand of love does not endure any more than
the common variety. It does not last.”
“Does anything last?” Sir John asked.
“Do we last? You are fifty now. If the
John Belltrees of twenty were to come
through that door would you recognise him?
Would you have anything in common with
him? Would he be you? Enough to say that
the hand of Time had no chance to spoil this
perfect union. It never wore out. It was
snapped.”
“I remember now,” Dr. Belltrees said.
“Glover was drowned.”
“Yes. He went out fishing off Kiama in
a crazy, little motor-launch which foundered
in a sudden summer southerly. Three
months after her superlative marriage Kate
was a widow.”
“And took the only infallible prescription
for widowhood —a new husband,” said Bell-
trees cynically.
“To you, no doubt, and to many others
who do not know the facts, that second mar-
riage seems an anti-climax. As a matter of
fact, she married on my advice.”
“I did not know that,” said Belltrees won-
deringly.
“It was some months after Glover’s death
that Kate came to me as a patient. I found
nothing wrong with her physical condition.
Her body was sound as it was splendid. And,
although she was enduring unteliable sorrow,
her waking mind showed no sign of decay
or subversion. In sleep, she told me, it was
different. Many nights in her sleep she
heard Harry call her name sharply, impera-
tively, as though he needed her immediate
presence. And always, she said, she arose in
spirit and went to seek him, but lacking any
sense of direction she never found him. In
the morning she had the memory of inter-
minable wanderings in some nebulous region
where the points of the compass did not
exist —in a state instead of a place. She
denied that she was a somnambulist. It
was not her body which went on those fruit-
less quests, she maintained, but her spirit.
‘That is the worst of it.’ she said to me
with strange certitude. ‘Tf I could go in
search of Harry whole, body and spirit, I
should find him. but I cannot find him with
only half myself.’
“I spoke to her of the effect of shock on
the subconscious mind and of its proneness
to manifest itself in sleep. She waved it all
aside. ‘Harry calls me,’ she maintained, ‘and
I shall find him some night.’
“It was impossible to shake her from this
attitude. She remained unmarried for three
years. Her life poised between the unreal
and the real —nights spent in strange spiri-
tual wanderings and days shadowed by a
pervading but unobtrusive grief.
“All this time Harbord was madly desir-
ous of his lost partner’s widow. Ilis pas-
sion for her was as intense as that of Harry
Glover, but it evoked no response beyond
that kindness which was a part of Kate’s
make-up. She would not marry again, be-
lieving herself dedicated to the dead.
He implored me to use my influence with
Kate in an endeavor to sway her from a
fruitless loyalty to the lost. I did my best,
for I had a fixed belief that the only hope
for Kate was a baby. I don’t know why
that tremendous few months of Kate’s mar-
riage had proved resultless, for never was
there a union from which the flowerage of
life seemed more certain. A baby, I feel
convinced, would have won her soul away
from Harry Glover’s spectral hand. You
see, I was not sure, in spite of Kate’s self-
possession, that her obsession about her dead
huband would not become monomaniacal if
it were allowed to persist. There was a
professional element in my championship of
Harbord. I had a desire to prove my theory
that maternity would destroy the effects of
what I then believed to be the shock to
Kate’s subconscious mind. But, as well, I
honestly liked Harbord. and wished him to
have his chance in life, for it was clear
enough that while Kate walked the earth
there would be no other woman for him.”
Belltrees quoted derisively: “What love
was ever as deep as the grave?”
“I think that Kate showed me one case,
and perhaps you will think so, too, yet.
“It was by playing upon Kate’s kindness
that eventually I induced her to marry Har-
bord, for I gave her my professional assur-
ance that I could not answer for either his
sanity or his life if she continued to refuse
him. That was an honest argument, but
there were two strings to it, for I believed
that marriage and a baby would be Kate’s
redemption also. Harbord was physically
and in character and worldly wealth every
way desirable. Kate, indeed, liked and
esteemed him greatly, and they married.
“But she frankly told Harbord that he
could not expect her love. She could not
abandon her belief that Harry Glover was
her unalterable mate whom she would re-
join some day. Harbord’s attitude was that
she would soon be cured of this delusion.
In any case his actual possession of her
physically was happiness enough for the poor
devil: and, like me, he banked on the baby.
“They were married only a few months
when he came to me in a pitiable state of
mental distraction. He made the strange
statement that Harry Glover really existed
in some form and was constantly coming be-
tween him and his wife.

ALL sufferers from Coughs, Colds,
Sore Throat or deep-seated Chest
Trouble should know that it is no longer
necessary to swallow liquid cough mix-
tures into the stomach. This is now an
obsolete method. The new Peps tablets
provide you with a powerful natural
medicine which is actually breathed
straight into throat, chest and lungs.
You simply strip a Peps of its silver
jacket and dissolve the tablet on your
tongue. The medicinal fumes then
given off mix with the breath and per-
colate through the throat and bronchial
tubes into the deepest and smallest air-
cells in the lungs.
A MEDICINE YOU BREATHE!
This demulcent Peps medicine reaches inner parts
of the chest. It ends germ trouble in the throat and
air-tubes, and relieves and heals the swollen, inflamed
mucous membrane. Coughing is promptly allayed;
hard, stringy phlegm loosened and expelled, breathing
becomes easy.
There is no other remedy so pleasant, so safe,
or so efficacious as Peps for dangers and weaknesses
threatening the throat, chest and lungs at this season.
Take Peps to secure freedom from coughs, colds,
sore throat, bronchitis, etc. Don’t venture out day
or night without the protection of Peps. Always
dissolve one in your mouth at the very first sign of
throat irritation or chest discomfort. Lastly—be sure
you get PEPS.

“ ‘I feel that she is more his wife than
mine,’ he complained, bitterly. ‘He-has her
soul. I hear her talkingin her sleep ; she spends
her nights in seeking him. She is not mine.
How can she be when she is in spirit an-
other man’s wife?’
“I tried to show him the fantastic folly
of being jealous of a ghost—not even a real
ghost, but a surmised one.
“ ‘He is real enough,’ he maintained, stub-
bornly, ‘to capture my wife’s spirit.’
“It was an awkward and difficult problem
which this new development presented. It
was by far the strangest case which had ever
come my way. Of all the adventures of the
human spirit which I have explored that of
these people were the most extraordinary.
“Their human qualifications were just
f.a.q., and Glover, Harbord and Kate might
have lived quite normally had they not been
brought into contact one with another. Your
practical mind probably decides that the
whole sorry business was a result of a mix-
ture of imagination, passion and morbidity :
but such extraordinary developments in the
psychology of ordinary personalities like
Kate and Harbord have me baffled and in-
cline me to the belief that they were sub-
jected to some outside influence which, if it
existed, would certainly be that of Glover.”
Belltrees’s shrug of his shoulders indicated
his scepticism.
“I always thought since this psychic
amendment to scientific pathology began that
it would lead us to ghosts,” he remarked.
The psychologist continued : “Look at that
picture.” The moon, three or four days past
the full, was brilliant in an atmosphere of
crystalline purity, from which a cold westerly
wind had purged the moisture of the coastal
sea. From the balcony of the specialist’s
apartment they could see the hushed Gar-
dens, the still ocean, the harbor points and
islands and the motionless ships, looking as
if darkly carved on a silver map. He pointed
to the moon. “If you trusted your sense you
would say that this wonderful light came
fi'om there. Your knowledge tells you that
it does not. You go further back; and it is
so when we consider human actions, thoughts
and passions. We limit their source to the
individual, yet the origin may lie elsewhere.
When we have explored the Amazon forest
and a few other places we shall know the
earth, but the exploration of the secret places
of the human spirit will never be finished.
We have no guide to these secret places, and
are only making the first, indecisive steps in
a wilderness to which there is no end. As a
light in this darkness, science has no value.
I don’t know in the least whether the tra-
gedy of last week is capable of mortal expla-
nation or was devised from without and be-
yond what we call mortal.
“Harbord asked me for a week-end to his
bungalow near Port Hacking. Feeling in
need of a rest, and, moreover, having a keen
desire to find how the uncanny spirit-
triangle was faring, I motored down to the
bungalow. A puncture in one of the back
tyres delayed me and it was nearly midnight
when I arrived.
“Kate had retired. Harbord and I sat
on the verandah enjoying a smoke and drink.
The bungalow is about three hundred yards
from the sea. To the south there is a little
beach, but directly to the east there is a line
of low cliffs, the intervening space between
the bungalow and the coast being the site
of a small forest of ti-trees. I liked that
wood, for the north-east wind had made the
whole forest slanting, giving it a fanciful
resemblance to a regiment of charging trees.
Through the little forest a pathway ran to
the cliff, from which there was a view along
the coast-line of uncommon spaciousness and
splendor.
“I saw at a glance that Harbord was
moody and dispirited, so that it was with
some foreboding I inquired about Kate.
“ ‘She is worse,’ he said, gloomily. ‘She
has taken to somnambulism. On bright moon-
light nights like this she is worse. I have
to watch carefully. I expect her to walk
to-night.’
“Then the climax came with sickening sud-
nedness.
“ ‘Look,’ he said in a voice full of excite-
ment as he rose from his chair, ‘she is out!’
“He pointed to the pathway which went
through the ti-trees to the cliff. A figure in
white was on the path, walking slowly. It
was Kate.
“Harbord sprang dpwn the steps in pur-
suit and I followed, calling softly to him to
be sure not to waken her.
“Exercising all the care we could, we
approached within a few yards of the sleep-
walker, when she paused as if to listen.
If I live for a thousand years I shall not
forget the few terrible seconds which fol-
lowed.
“‘Harry!’ Her cry rang out exultantly.
“I put my hand on Ilarbord’s arm and
saw -his face set in terrible anger. Then
with amazing speed Kate raced to the cliff.
“Harbord wrenched himself from my grasp.
‘By God.’ he said, ‘lie shall not have her!’
and lie dashed after his flying wife. I fol-
lowed helplessly.
“He must have caught Kate on the very
edge of the cliff, too late to save her, for
when their bodies were found his arms were
clasped about her.”
“The end of a remarkable story,” Bell-
trees mused.
“If it was the end,” said Sir John, “there
may be a sequel.”
“What sequel?”
# “I do not know. I am where I stood that
night, on the edge of a cliff looking into
the sea.”
P. E. QUINN.
The Request.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I*l HAT’S the time now, Lil ?” in-
\\ quired the woman on the bed.
" “Quarter past six” replied
Lil after a glance at the clock. “’E can’t
be much longer now, Mother.”
“I ’ope not,” murmured the sick woman
wearily. “I don’t think I got much longer,
an’ I must see ’im before I go.”
“Dunno what yer want ter see ’im for
so bad, Mother,” said Lil tunelessly. “ ’E's
a crook that’s never treated any of us right,
an’
“That's enough, Lil!” broke in her mother
with a hint of sharpness. “Yer ain’t ter
speak of yer father like that. Crook ’e is,
I admit, but lately I’ve come ter think ’e’s a
long way better than either you or Albert
what’s honest. There’s somethin’ terrible
’ard an’ unforgivin’ about you two children,
an’ there’s nothin’ of that sort about Jim.
Easy-goin’ an’ careless ’e may be, but ’e’s
always bin good ter me. Drunk or sober,
’e’s never lifted an’ ’and or used his tongue
ag’in me. No, not once in 30 year.”
“Orright, Mother,” replied Lil sullenly.
“ 'Ave it yer own way. But don’t talk about
it no more. Yer’ll only excite yerself.”
The sick woman feebly hitched the bed-
clothes closer up under her chin, and, fixing
her dull eyes on the grimy ceiling imme-
diately overhead, resumed her silent, patient
waiting, and the only sound in the squalid
room was the loud, steady ticking of a clock.
The woman was obviously dying. She ap-
peared to be scarcely breathing, and under
the yellow flickering light of the single gas-
;iet the only noticeable sign of life in that
immobile waxen face were two cavernous
eyes fixed steadily and unblinkingly overhead.
“Lil,” she exclaimed in a scarcely audible
whisper after several minutes of silence. “I
ain’t goin’ ter see Jim no more. ’E’ll be too
late. Tell ’im ter keep A 1 straight. I’m
frightened. . . .fer Al. There’s somethin’ ’ard
an’ cruel about ’im, an’.... if ’e was ter go
crook ’e’d stop at nothin’. ’E'd never be
took quiet like Jim.”
“Orright, Mum,” answered Lil. “Don’t
you worry now about Al or father. Oh,
don’t, Mum ! Pull yerself together, dearie,”
she cried, frightened by her mother’s ster-
torous, difficult breathing. “ ’Ave a drink
of yer medicine.”
But her mother, feebly waving away the
proffered glass, continued feverishly: “Tell
’im ter keep Al straight. By the mem’r.v
of 30 year ago—that’s the last thing I ask
’im. ’E’ll do it... .will Jim. Always—kind-
’earted”....
About half an hour later big Jim Larrasy,
who had come in to find Lil weeping over his
dead wife, was listening to her final request.
The awful suddenness and unexpectedness
of the event had bemused him, and deep in
his heart was a great regret that he had
not been with her. Lil was confusing him,
too. What did she want to keep on magging
about Al for? To Hell with Al! What did
he matter? What did anything matter with
his poor, faithful, old missus lying there?
“She says with her last breath ter keep
Al straight,” droned Lil monotonously.
“What’s that, me gal? What”
“She said,” repeated Lil. “be the mem’r.v
of 30 year ago, yer was ter keep Al straight.”
“Keep Al straight! My .(lawd. now I
remember why I ’urried ’ome. Where is
he?”
“I dunno. ’E come in a few minutes after
mother died, an’ —’ere ’e is.”
“Al,” demanded Larrasy of the furtive-
eyed young man standing in the doorway.
“D’yer see yer mother lyin’ there, an’ d'yer
know what killed ’er?”
“ ’Eart,” replied Al listlessly.
“Yer right,” replied his father grimly.
“She died of ’eart right enough—broken
’eart; an’ we broke it between us.”
“Speak fer yerself, father,” began Lil
stormily. “You’re the only one”
“Shut yer trap, me gal! I say we broke
it between us. You two, with yer hard, un-
lovin’ ways, an’ me in every other way.
D’yer know, young feller,” he went on, turn-
ing to his son, “that ’er last words was fer
me ter keep you straight?”
“Lil told me somethin’ like that.”
“Where was yer last night?”
“Wh—what d’yer wanter”
“Was yer in Botany?”
“Botany! What’d I be doin’ in Botany?”
“Yer lyin’! I c’n see it in yer sneakin’
face! Yer was in Botany last night. An’
what’s more, yer was wearin’ me links with
me initials on the back that yer mother give
me 20 year ago. I was tipped off this
mornin’ that the ‘dicks’ ’ad found one of
’em an’ was after me. an’ I been dodgin’
about ever since. They’ll be ’ere any minuts
now. Keep you straight! A bloke that ’d
come at a job like that’s a low-down, cow-
ardly” Here he paused abruptly at th*
sound of footsteps, and then turned sharply
to face two detectives who had opened the
door and entered the room.
They halted momentarily at sight of the
dead woman, and then one of them advanced
and bent over her.
“This your wife, Larrasy?”
“Yes.”
“What did she die of?”
“ ’Eart attack, me gal tells me. I was
away from ’ome at the time.”
“H’m! Well, I’m sorry, Larrasy. I’ve
nabbed many a man in me time, but never
quite in these circumstances. You’ll have
to come along with me all the same.”
“What fur?” demanded Larrasy.
“To answer a few questions. I'm not
arresting you—yet. But we want to know
all you can tell us about an affair at Botany
last night. It was rough stuff, Larrasy,
and although it’s not your style to wear a
mask and nse a black-jack, I think you can
tell us a good deal.”
“What’s the charge goin’ ter be?”
“It’s a case of assault and possibly rob-
bery.”
“An’ yer say the bloke was wearin’ a
mask?” muttered Larrasy thoughtfully.
“You’ll find out all about it at the sta-
tion,” replied the detective impatiently.
“You’ll come quietly, I suppose?”
“Wait a. minute,” replied Larrasy, and
turning his back on the officer he walked
over to the bed.
"I got yer message, old girl,” he said in
strangely gentle tones. “Yer stuck ter me
through thick an’ thin, an’—l’ll do what yer
wanted. Al,” he continued harshly to his
trembling, ashen-faced son, “yer know what
that message was! Ter keep you straight!
Well, I’m goin’ ter do it. Even if they fix
this Botany affair on ter me an’ I go ter
quod, I’ll still be able ter git noos of you.
I bin there before, an’ I know the ropes,
an’ if you make a crook move I’ll ’ear of it,
an’ when I come out, if yer ain’t run straight
—so ’elp me Gawd, I’ll choke the life outer
yer like I would a dawg! D’ye understand?”
Without waiting for a reply he turned to
the detectives.
“Righto !” he announced gruffly.
