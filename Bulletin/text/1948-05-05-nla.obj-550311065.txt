ABBOTSFORD — THE HOME OF SIR WALTER SCOTT
/"\N the banks of the River Tweed, near Melrose, in the Border
country of Scotland, stands Abbotsford, the mansion house
built by Walter Scott out of the vast sums of money which he
earned as an author. By 1820 Abbotsford began to attract pilgrims
from all over the world; illustrious men like Wordsworth, Crabbe
and Washington Irving being among those who came to pay homage
to the great novelist.
Walter Scott was born in Edinburgh in 1771 and studied law
at Edinburgh University. He was called to the Bar in 1792 and
married five years later. He first gained attention as a writer in
1799 after the publication of 'his first book, which was a metrical
translation of Burger’s “Lenore.” Three years later his volume of
old ballads of the Border country aroused even greater interest.
“The Lay of the Last Minstrel,” “Marmion” and “The Lady of
the Lake” followed in quick succession, and these metrical tales had
an instant and wide success, and the writer began acquiring
considerable wealth.
Scott now began' writing prose; “Waverley” was issued in
1814, and this was followed by many such works, prominent among
them being “Guy Mannering,” “Ivanhoe” and “Kenilworth.” The
author was created a baronet in 1820 and elected president of the
Royal Society of Scotland.
It seemed now that Scott would end his days in prosperity,
but unfortunately the publishing firm of Ballantyne, in which he
had invested his capital, was declared bankrupt, and the novelist
found himself responsible for a vast sum of money.
Declining many offers of financial help, Scott set himself to
clear off the debt by writing further novels at amazing speed. His
health, however, began to fail, and after a short trip to the Con-
tinent he returned to his home in Abbotsford, where he died on
21st September, 1832, and was buried at Dryburgh. The house is
open to the public, and is throughout intimately associated with its
creator.

SHEAF-TOSSER.
The lone crow caws from the tall dead
gum :
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
And judges the stack with one watery eye,
Then turns the other to fix its lie.
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
There are four tiers of sheaves on the
wagon yet
And one more loaded is standing by;
My arms are aching and Tm dripping
sweat
But the sun is three axe-handles in the
sky
And 1 must toss sheaves till dark.
It is fourteen feet from the ground to
the eaves :
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
And two feet six to the third roof row.
Six feet high stands the load below:
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
Ten feet six now must I pitch,
Into the centre of the stack I throw
To the turner and the short-handled fork
with which
He thrusts sheaves to the builder in
monotonous flow,
Butts out and long-side down.
There are twenty-five crows on the old
dry gum : •
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
Thirteen on one branch and twelve on
the other
And each one calls as loud as his brother,
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
My hands are blistered, my sore lips crack
And I wonder whether the turner would
smother
If a hard throw knocked him off the stack
And a few sheaves slipped on top ? But
there’d come another
And I’d still toss sheaves.
There are thousands of crows on the
gaunt white gum :
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
The reds are pale in the western sky
And the stack is more than sixty feet
high :
Caw. Caw. Caw-diddle-daw.
My fork grows heavy as the light grows
dim.
There are five sheaves left but I’ve fear
of a whim
That one of the crows has an evil eye
And the five sheaves left will be there
when I die.
For each bird’s forgotten how to fly
Till he drives out my soul with the force
of his cry:
Caw. Caw. Caw. Caw.
Caw. Caw. Caw. Caw.

ERIC C. ROLLS.
Australian Photography .
Oswald L. Ziegler, hailing from South
Australia, but for some, time more or
less settled in Sydney, has inherited the
mantle that old Jack Moses used to wear.
Jack was born in the Sydney Haymarket,
when cows chewed the grass and cud in
Hyde iPark, and there was no doubt about
the quality of his Australianism, which
is the mantle Ziegler has come into.
It’s an accommodating sort of mantle,
since old Jack was, as he’d have said
himself, knee-high to a grasshopper and
resembled a gnome, while Ziegler has the
shape and shoulders and energy of a
heavyweight scrapper in. good trim. To-
wards the end Jack used to like to stand
about in what bit of sun gets down into
the George-street canyon, and think and
talk of wheatfields and vineyards and
dairy herds and all the rest of country
Australia. He got some of it down in
verse and sketches, but he never managed
to express half the feeling for it that
was in him. Maybe he was too infatu-
ated.
Ziegler has the same amount and kind
of enthusiasm, but a different way of
seeking to express it. His outlook is
wider, taking in the cities as well as the
Bush that old Jack doted on; the
machinery as well as the pumpkins ; and
his effective mode of expression is the
pictorial—books of photographs and de-
scriptions like the big one he got out
for the Sydney centenary, his later This Is
Australia, and now his Australian Photo-
graphy, 1947, which he aims to make a
lasting annual. All three publications are
first-rate things of their kind; excellent
in production and good taste, Ziegler be-
ing very fortunate in his collaborator
Gert Sellheim, responsible for design,
layout and typography, and so good at it
that the Photography annual would have
its own distinction in any company of
such volumes.
With this photography publication
there are to be annual awards of gold,
silver and bronze plaques; the gold
plaque going this year to Axel Poignant,
who merits it not so much for his top-
notch photograph of a young lubra with
a piccaninny at her breast as for the
sincerity in his several other photographs
as well. His head of an abo. stockman
is probably the most genuinely effective
photograph in the book. With his
possum, barking-lizard and bird pictures,
his lubra and stockman have the prime
quality of being instantly interesting
without any straining for effect.
Many of the others have a great deal
to learn from the winner in the matter of
being first of all interesting with appa-
rent simplicity, though it can be said
for the production altogether that there
is a minimum of trying to make the
camera be what it isn’t. There are pic-
tures too artily contrived for the present
reviewer’s taste, but even in these there
is no doubt about the presence of the
camera. That, it’s certain, is to the credit
of the selection committees, working on
the lines set forth in a foreword by Hal
.Missingham: “The first consideration in,
the selection of prints for this annual has
been directed pointedly towards those
photographs that unmistakably pronounce
themselves as photographs; that are not
imitative of other graphic methods.”
The annual carries introductory articles
by Max Dupain (whose contributions in-
clude a most remarkable photograph of
Sydney by night), Harold Cazneaux, S.
Woodward-Smith, Russell Roberts, E.
Hamilton Aikin, Athol Shmith and
Josephine O’Neill. A section of color-
photographs is most notable for John
Lee’s posed study of a girl, in amber
tints, well meriting its silver plaque.
Though it is a book of Australian
photography —as distinct from Ziegler’s
other productions, which were books of
Australia —and hence not having to be
embracing in subjects, it still seems odd
that sport is an absentee; particularly,
too, as Athol Shmith’s contributed article
is on the photo.-finish camera. This, no
doubt, will be corrected in future years.
It might be suggested that, as a layman
sees such things, are other interests
in good photographs besides the purely
technical, including that of identity. In
most of the portraits this is attended to
by adding the subjects’ names ; it could
be extended to all such landscapes as the
one labelled “Sunshine and Storm”: if,
as suspected, this is Port Macquarie,
wouldn’t there be some historic or
general-interest addition to the photo-
graph, in naming it?
Such suggestions, of course, are purely
from the layman point of view; but
Australian Photography, 1947, is so in-
teresting a production all round that its
appeal will hardly be restricted to photo-
graphers. For these, naturally, it has
a special appeal; and for their particular
benefit there is an appendix of exact de-
tails regarding the kind of camera used,
the taking, the materials and so forth.
There are also the gaps in subjects for
them to have a shot at filling in later
issues, and entries from more of them
should remove the impression that any-
body has been over-represented. Without
seeing what was rejected it’s not possible
to say whether the committees had any
alternative to that or to a few of the
weaker inclusions.
Some of the gaps are filled, more or
less, by a book which has been pub-
lished at the same time as Australian
Photography a collection of Max
Dupain Photographs put together in a
very handsome format in an edition
of one thousand by Ure Smith Pty., Ltd.
Dupain, for instance, labels his photo-
graphs so that there is no excuse for
confusing the distinguished features of
Mr. S. Ure Smith —looking rather like
Mr. R, G. Menzies —with those of a
quizzical William Dobell or (dramatic,
but too dark for fidelity) Norman Lind-
say. Even without the labels nobody
would be likely to mistake the ballet-
dancers for the Kirrawina Wives or
“Baby Protesting” for anything but a
baby roaring in a bath, but still it is as
well to be clear.
The landscapes are similarly identified.
“Fragment of French’s Forest” looks as
barren as a slice of the Centre, and “Alice
Springs Country,” with silver sunlight on
the gum-trees, proves that the Centre has
been much maligned. “Brisbane River”
is a straightforward Brisbane River, and
“Karri Country, West Australia” shows
magnificent trees and a bush locomotive
all ready to steam off with them.
Dupain also covers sport —not widely,
but with enough views of surfing and
yachting, as well as a gruesomely life-
like representation of the new national
pastime of standing in queues, to make
the book reasonably effective as a survey
of Australian activities besides being
what it sets out to be—a fine collection
of photographs: “a cross-section of what
I believe to be my best work since 1935.”
If Max Dupain Photographs has a
special and original quality, apart from
technique, it is in the photographs of out-
of-the-way oddments of landscape and
of the humbler oddments of nature: a
picture of blackboys, of the ripples on
a bush pool, of the lacy edge of a wave,
and of a scrap of some coarse, tussocky
plant on Bungan Beach the leaves of
which, as the wind has swept them, have
cut a circle in the sand.
These are the sort of vital details of
landscape that get into Norma Davis’s
pdetry and Lance Solomon’s paintings,
but not into the lesser sorts of art that
deal in generalities. Even the photo-
graph of a dead gum-tree against a
mackerel sky gives the pleasant impres-
sion that, instead of hating this country,
as do most of the artists who paint dead
gum-trees, Dupain loves it. There’s an
inescapable coldness in the camera —as
is shown especially by Dupain’s nudes—
but the artist can learn something from
it: the selection and arrangement of
unusual subjects, and the warmth and
veneration for nature of the man behind
the camera.
South African Landscape .
In An Editor Looks Back (Juta, Ltd.)
G. A. L. Green takes a series of modest
glances at a long and successful journal-
istic career, beginning in 1883, on an
English provincial paper at 2s. 6d. a
week, improving to a job on the London
headquarters of the “Pioneer” of Alla-
habad —Kipling’s old paper —and, after
1894, when he went to South Africa,
entering into the ardors and glories of
editorship; at, one suspects, some truly
imperial salary.
The suspicion, perhaps, is unfounded.
But the book, in content, so closely
follows the grain of a typical suc-
cess story—without any suggestion of
vulgarity—that it might serve as a text-
book for aspiring journalists. Other
journalists who have also been creative
writers for instance, Kipling have
evoked more of the ferment and fury of
newspaper work. The atmosphere of
An Editor Looks Back is more tranquil,
yet compelling.
There is the genuine taste of printer’s
ink, the rustle of copy-paper and the
comforting crackle of pay-envelopes, all
of which cumulatively produces realism.:
In the London phase of the book there
is no flashing portrait; but there is, for
instance, the information that Sir George
Allen, proprietor of the “Pioneer,” was
married to the daughter of a country
clergyman ; that the “Pioneer” at that
time was making a steady £lO,OOO a year
profit; that Green, on his arrival in Lon-
don, wore a suit of distressingly provincial
cut. And in the absence of further in-
formation about Kipling—who was, in
any case, in India—it is interesting to
learn that Sir George usually spoke of his
most famous employee as “the young
man with the swelled head” —a possible
source of consolation to conceited young
journalists everywhere.
But it is the South African landscape
which is chiefly interesting, and here the
author had the good fortune to encounter
historical giants: Rhodes; and, later.
Smuts.
Rhodes, when Green first saw him from
the Press Gallery of the old Cape House of
Assembly, was not impressive. He spoke
badly, and Green was astonished next day
to discover that the speech (on the Glen
Grey Bill) was acclaimed as a miracle of
statesmanlike wisdom and foresight. But
“the glamor of a tremendous and
magnetic personality was there,” and
Green, as he became progressively more
intimate with Rhodes, felt it more surely.
Later, Green accompanied Rhodes on
electioneering tours, and by a stratagem
as old as journalism convinced Rhodes
of his reliability. Hitherto Rhodes had
disliked having his speeches reported,
complaining that shorthand writers “put
it down when he coughed.” Then he
asked Green to take down a speech “just
for fun.” Rhodes spoke lor two hours.
After the meeting I remarked: “Of
course, you won’t care about seeing your
speech in the papers?”
“I don’t know,” said Rhodes. “Just
write it out for fun and well see.”
This amusement kept me busy until 3
a.m. writing by the light of a single candle.
After a few hours’ rest I went once
more to see Rhodes. I found him arguing
with the colored chambermaid, who was
trying to turn him out of his bedroom
I was a trifle nervous about bits of my
own which I had stuck in here and there
in order to clarify what I knew he had
been trying to say. I had not gone far
when Rhodes interrupted me: “I didn’t
think I had spoken so well. I call that
a real bit of jam for your paper.”
Thereafter he frequently oraised qiy
scrupulous accuracy and described me to
his friends as the Prince of Reporters.
Much of the book, by virtue of a
chronological method of writing, is un-
inspiring: a plateau, or at best a steady
inclination to an editor’s chair, broken
by meetings with Rhodes. But in the
chapter on the siege of Kimberley, where
Green was editor of the Diamond Fields
“Advertiser” and Rhodes was a discon-
certing and extraordinary civilian, there
is a sharp rise in interest. The siege it-
self is interesting, Green paints a clear
picture, and the feud between Rhodes and
the Army, which has been variously re-
presented, gives an internal drama to the
struggle.
On General Smuts An Editor Looks
Back has much to say, in the form of
Green’s war diary. For instance:
September 6, 1939.
The new coalition cabinet with General
Smuts as Prime Minister and including
representatives of the Labor and Dominion ,
parties has been sworn in. Smuts re-
marked at lunch today that the last few
days had yielded the most astonishing sur-
prises he had ever known in his Parliamen-
tary career. I gathered that, so far as he
was concerned, Hertzog’s neutrality declara-
tion was totally unexpected. Hertzog, on
the other hand, confidently reckoned on a
majority.... and was utterly dumbfounded
when he discovered at the last moment
the true state of feeling. A leading mem-
ber of Parliament who was present con-
firmed this, and added that as the crucial
debate went on Pirow, the “villain of the
piece,” grew more and more uneasy.
From these notes a good, but neces-
sarily limited, picture of Smuts the
statesman arises. And it documents,
sometimes with startling clarity, the com-
plex and uneasy situation in South Africa
at the beginning of the war when only
statesmanship of the major kind —indul-
gent when necessary, unyielding when
mere was necessity for strength—could
deal with South Africa’s peculiar prob-
lems.
Not all the landscape is South African ;
Green went to the conference of Empire
editors at the end of the 1914-18 war,
and in England as well as in South
Africa he has met his share of the world’s
great and notorious. Many of the char-
acters sketched—for instance. Sir Abe
Bailey—are lively. Others, dull. For this
the most probable explanation is that
important people are often dull in con-
versation, and a man who has done earth-
shaking things may talk of nothing more
fascinating than the weather. But a
proper share must be laid at the door of
the author; the reverse side, as it were,
to the realistic study of journalism.
Among portraits of famous editors and
politicians there is something of the heavi-
ness of a civic dinner.

machines in Australia? (2) What
stations were the first to use a few
stands of shearing machinery along-
side the blades? (3) The first sheds
to carry gut a complete shearing with
machines alone?
(1) First recorded shearing was by
F. Y. Wolseley during the evolution
of the shearing machine which he
later patented. His first patent was
recorded in 1877. Many improve-
ments had to be effected to the early
machines, and in 1885 a demonstration
was given in Goldsbrough’s store in
Melbourne. A company was floated
then to manufacture shearing
machinery. (2) Those recorded are
Normanby, Qld., and Toganmain,
N.S.W., in 1887. (3) Dunlop, N.S.W.,
in July, 1888, and Yamraa Station,

Can trefoil be destroyed in a
flower-garden without damaging * the
plants ?
The word “trefoil” is rather loosely
used and is applied to a number of
different plants, including species of
Lotus, Melilotus, Medicago and even
Trifolium. The common species of
these genera are all reasonably easy
to control by normal garden cultiva-
tion. Another genus of plants, Oxalis,
has a leaf rather like that of the
“trefoils,” and most members of this
genus are very difficult to control
because of the bulbs produced. Un-
fortunately, there is no easy way to get
rid of Oxalis when growing amongst
other plants. Continued frequent
cultivation to prevent the development
of green leaves will ultimately exhaust
the bulbs. Smothering by sheet-iron,
wood, tarred paper to prevent the
light getting to the leaves would have
the same effect.

UHCABLED
ADDITIONS
END OF A MANDATE.
The date set for Britain’s
laying down of the wretched
Palestine mandate is at hand,
with U.N.O.’s marvellous par-
tition botchery discredited, and,
what is very much to the point,
no time left for establishing
something adequate in place of
the British control.
The U.N.O. partition decision
was reached on November 29.
It was not till April 2 that the
U.S. came out with its request
for a special General Assembly
meeting and its proposal for a
trusteeship instead of the par-
tition scheme.
That matter of time might
make the U.N.O. action a good
deal worse than mere botchery.
The action —ill-judged and very
dubiously brought about by
pressure on some hesitant sup-
porters—might be rated a crime.
Like U.N.O. itself as a peace
instrument, the action caused a
false sense of security. U.N.O.
had decided; U.N.0., many
thought, would be obeyed. So
an entirely false atmosphere was
created by the U.N.O. Solomons,
and because of that atmosphere
the precious months have slipped
by in which something conceiv-
ably might have been done. All
that partition achieved was to
kill so much time ; and the kill-
ing of that time looks like now
having a tragic harvest of kill-
ings.
N. Y. “Times” U.N.O. corre-
spondent James Reston has drawn
up a long list of shelved prob-
lems ; among them: Has the
U.N.O. Palestine Commission
the men, money and legal autho-
rity to now carry out the func-
tions of government? Who
will pay the police and
who will provide them? (Apart
from troops, there have been
16.000 police trying to maintain
order, 9000 of them Arabs, 4000
Jews and the rest British.) How
will the commission be able to
prevent a Jewish-Arab race for
arms when it hasn’t a force to
protect even itself?
There is fhe-question of food.
Britain has been supplying
Palestine with, for example,
13.000 tons of flour or its equi-
valent every month. This will
stop, as will all other British
food supplies. Where will the
commission get the funds to
keep these necessary imports
going?
Or, as Reston asks: “Who
will run the trains, deliver the
mail, operate the telephone
system, repair the telephone and
railroad lines that crisscross
between Jewish Palestine and
Arab Palestine? The British
say these will be handed over
to the United Nations, but
specifically to whom? Legali-
ties aside, who will shovel the
coal and shinny the telephone-
poles?”
Or the health services? A
close watch on frontiers checking
cholera “carriers” has held off
the cholera epidemics which
threaten the place every spring.
What of the future?
There are many more similar
problems involved. The mere
listing of them is itself a notable
tribute to the capable job
Britain has done in the face of
criminal ingratitude. They will
miss the British control of things
there.
Reston has the hardihood to
raise the question: “Do the
British, despite provocation,
have the right to get out before
an alter-force for maintaining
order is arranged?” He might
try asking it of the mothers of
the long list of murdered; or,
for that matter, of the British
people altogether.
Another view of that question
is that it amounts to trying to
fasten on to Britain responsi-
bility for the U.N.O. crime of
an action which prevented those
problems from being fairly and
squarely faced long ago. Britain
gave more than ample notice.
Britain also gave more than
ample notice on another aspect
—that it was standing no further
nonsense from anybody regard-
ing Palestine. That notice was
given when Mr. Bevin, exasper-
ated by American interference,
took the very drastic action of
making public his bid to induce
Mr. Truman not to come out in
favor of a Jewish immigration
of 100,000, and the reply he re-
ceived : that Mr. Truman would
have to make the proposal, be-
cause if he didn’t Mr. Dewey
would.
At that time Mr. Bevin
thought he was well on the way
towards reconciling Arabs and
Jews to an agreement, and he
spoke in a tone that should have
been a warning. But that has
been ignored by the Canberra
delegation, blithely insisting that
U.N.O. must go on with the par-
tition scheme. In U.N.O. on
April 23 this brought from the
British representative a blunt
showdown challenge. Referring
to the U.N.O. delegates insist-
ing on partition, Mr. Creech
Jones said they must face
squarely arid honestly the ques-
tion: “Are their Governments
prepared to participate in im-
plementing partition?”
That was bluntly telling Can-
berra, along with others: “Say
how many troops you will send,
or shut up.” The British dele-
gate would know very well that
Canberra would not dare offer a
platoon.
Dr. Evatt had suggested that
partition had been abandoned
because of “intrigues” which
had “undermined the Jewish
position.” Mr. Creech Jones de-
livered the snub direct to that
also: “I believe it was the
honest facing of this problem
[the question of troops; of
American lads being sent to
shed their blood for the U.N.O.
botch] which led the United
States to suggest a new line of
action [trusteeship] in the hope
of finding a way out of the ap-
palling dilemma we are in to-
day.”
A similar honest facing of the
problem of troops would have
saved Canberra from cutting
such a ridiculous figure in
U.N.O.—-prepared to talk all
day, but not to send even Mr.
Falstein armed with a Swiss
grenade.
A Palestine Solution.
An entirely fresh approach
towards solving the tragic enough
Arab-Jewish conflict in Pales-
tine, and the far worse that this
could easily develop into, has
been proposed in a letter given
prominence in London “Times” ;
the writer a singularly qualified
authority—James A. Malcolm,
the man who initiated the nego-
tiations which resulted in the
Balfour Declaration and the
subsequent British mandate.
Unlike U.N.O.’s partition
makeshift, which could only
have been temporary, leading
certainly to war at once or later,
and unlike the even more tem-
porary trusteeship scheme, Mal-
colm’s proposal aims at a solu-
tion that could have perman-
ence.
Holding that “no acceptable
permanent solution can be found
within the present territorial
limits of Palestine,” he suggests
a new policy based on the rein-
tegration of Transjordan with
Cis-Jordan Palestine so as to
form a single Arab-Israel Pales-
tine State (or United Palestine).
“The ruler of this' State should
be an Arab, He could be
found in the person of the wise
and benevolent Abdullah of
Transjordan who would be
chosen King of United Pales-
tine.”
The choice of an Arab
Sovereign, the writer believes,
would need to be balanced by
arrangements that the Prime
Minister (or Minister President)
of the Arab-Israel State should
be a Jew, and that other Minis-
tries and Under-Secretaryships
should be divided equally or
proportionately between Jews
and Arabs. The Ministries
should include a Minister of
Arab Affairs, a Minister of
Jewish Affairs, and a Minister of
Christian Affairs, and a repre-
sentative appointed by the Trus-
teeship Council of U.N. to ad-
vise on administration, choice of
Ministers and the preparation of
a democratic constitution to be
established, say, five years hence.
On the thorny immigration
issue the writer proposes that
since the reintegration of Trans-
jordan would bring into Pales-
tine between 300,000 and 400,000
additional Arabs, a sufficient
number of Jewish immigrants
(some 200,000) should be ad-
mitted to the country as soon
as practically possible in order
to maintain the existing ratios
between the two peoples. An
Arab-Jewish commission would
be needed to regulate future
Jewish and Arab immigration.
For obvious reasons, he says,
Jerusalem should not be the capi-
tal of the new State. Some other
site would have to be chosen,
or created, as its political and
administrative centre. The
guardianship of the Holy Places
should be retained by Great
Britain or some other authority
under a modified mandate, sub-
ject to the supervision of the
United Nations. Defence should
be entrusted to a Volunteer De-
fence Force composed of Arab
and Jewish contingents propor-
tionate to the Arab and Jewish
populations, under a neutral
commanding officer to be recom-
mended by the Trusteeship
Council, but approved and ap-
pointed by the proposed King.
“There is reason to believe,”
the writer concludes, “that a
policy framed on these lines
would appeal to many respon-
sible elements among Arabs and
Jews, who would regard it as a
constructive way of escape from
the present distressing position.”
Truman Stocks Low.
President Truman has fol-
lowed Roosevelt in labelling the
N. Y. “Daily Mirror” column-
ist Drew Pearson a liar.
Departing from the curious
rule that Presidential statements
made at White House press con-
ferences must not be directly
quoted, Mr. Truman authorised
direct quotation, and said im-
mediately one conference
opened:
“First, I want to pay atten-
tion to a vicious statement that
was made by a columnist in a
New York paper, in which he
said I had made the statement
here to an editor of a New York
paper that the Jews in New
York were disloyal. I had
thought I would not have to add
another liar’s star to that fel-
low’s crown, but I will have to
do it. That is just a lie out of
the whole cloth. That is as
emphatic as I can put it.”
What Pearson had written
was:
' President Truman was talking to a
New York publisher about Palestine.
Pounding his desk, he made re-
marks about “the New York
Jews.”
“They’re disloyal to their country.
Disloyal!” he cried.
“Would you explain that further,
Mr. President?” interrupted the pub-
lisher, whose wife happens to be
Jewish. “When you speak of New
York Jews are you referring to such
people as Bernard Baruch? Or are
you referring to such New York Jews
as my wife?”
Truman glared, assured his visitor
he did not mean to include Baruch
or the publisher’s wife —then abruptly
changed the subject.
At the press conference Mr.
Truman made the further
pointed remark that, while the
Pearson report was a lie, it made
good reading in an election year.
The affair is chiefly interest-
ing as a good illustration of how
anything whatever goes in
American Presidential scraps. In
one long-past election the
wholly unfounded story that a
candidate was the father of an
illegitimate child was spread
about, accompanied by the ab-
surd chant, sung by the candi-
date’s opponents all over the
country, “Ha ha ha! Where’s
papa? Gone to the White
House. Ha ha ha! ” The candi-
date did not go to the White
House, though subsequently it
was shown that the whole story
was an electioneering fabrica-
tion.
The Pearson incident also em-
phasises one of the most effec-
tive of the various lines of attack
on Mr. Truman. In the past
Palestine served Mr. Truman
well, but now the ungainly
chicken has come home to roost.
It figures prominently in lists of
various unhelpful things that
have refused to wait until after
the elections.
With all this pressure of
events, George E. Sokolsky com-
ments in N. Y. “Sun,” “Harry
Truman needed the decisiveness
of a man who knew his way,
whose philosophy of life was so
certain and fixed that no one
could mistake his responses to
any challenge. Instead he vacil-
lated, reversed himself, spoke
out of turn and contradicted
himself by his acts. He fell
through indecision, and his inde-
cision was a product of lack of
personal knowledge, for no one,
not even his worst enemies, will
question Harry Truman’s inten-
tions.”
Sokolsky—recognised as a
very sound commentator —began
another article: “No President
since Andrew Johnson faced the
personal misfortunes that bring
to an end Harry Truman’s
career as President, He has lost
the confidence of the people;
he has lost the support of his
party. The last two years of
Herbert Hoover’s Presidency
were very hard indeed, but his
party stood by him until he was
actually defeated.”
“And so,” Sokolsky bleakly
concluded on Mr. Truman’s
position, “it is all over. He
might just as well not run.”
N. Y. “Times” Washington
correspondent Arthur Krock,
also inclined to accept that Mr.
Truman is virtually a goner,
makes an interesting analysis of
the effects, including interna-
tional effects, of the weakening
of a President’s prestige. Seeing
Mr. Truman’s position being ex-
ceptionally weakened “by the
prevailing opinion that he can-
not be elected in November,”
Krock emphasises that the ex-
tent of this lessening of Mr.
Truman’s influence “is of im-
mense importance to the Demo-
cratic party, to the United States
and to the world.”
“The gravity of the peril,”
says Krock, “arises from the
state of the relations between
the United States and Soviet
Russia, which the President
must conduct until January 20,
1949, at least.”
He sees party opposition to
Mr. Truman as bringing the
Presidency to a most serious
plight “in a time of great crisis”:
“The effects can be very serious,
and this explains why other
Democrats who have lost confi-
dence in Mr. Truman’s capacity
or his prospect of re-election
have not joined the open-party
opposition. A President whose
defeat at the next poll is gener-
ally prophesied and who is re-
jected by factions that unite only
on that issue faces difficulties in
performing his office that con-
ceivably could bring disaster.”
Krock reviews various factors
that might aid a Truman come-
back, chief among them being
“developments in the foreign
situation.” But, while adding
the saver that “no Presidential
candidate of a major party is
certainly defeated until the votes
have been cast and counted,” he
ends as dolefully as any of them
regarding Mr, Truman: “The
President’s influence at this writ-
ing is weaker than any Presi-
dent’s has been in modern
American history, and in an
hour when national security re-
quires all the strength implicit
in his office.”
Corns Need Red Army.
Commenting on the Italian
elections, Walter Lippmann, in
N. Y, “Herald Tribune,” points
out a significant fact with some
hope in it —that “for 30 years,
during the whole time in which
the Communist movement has
been in active force, no country
has ever been subjugated by the
Communists unless the Russian
Army was able to intervene de-
cisively.”
The writer recalls how after
the First World War local Com-
munists seized power in
Hungary, in parts of Germany,
in northern Italy and in various
other scattered places, but were
soon overthrown. The Soviet
Union was unable to give them
military support and the native
Communists, the Russian
agents, were unable to hold
power agamst the nationahst
forces and the national armies,
Since then, m the interval be-
tween the two wars, Western
Europe remained democratic and
capitalist. Central and Eastern
Europe, with the exception of
Czechoslovakia, were authon-
tarian or Fascist. But no Euro-
pean country, however dislocated
and impoverished, went Com-
munist.
After the Second Wor i d War.
Lippmann adds, the Red Army
advanced to the centre of
Europe. All the countries fcfe-
bjnd and enveloped by it,
bave been brought under Com-
niunist domination. But as yet
n 0 European country has gone
Communist which was not oc-
CU pj e d or surrounded by the
Red Army .

nominated and sure to be defeated.

Driving Corns Underground. —N. Y.
“Sun” demolishes one of the Chifley
“arguments” against doing anything
to curb Corns : “It has been argued
that to outlaw the party would be
to drive its members underground.
However, the most dangerous of
them, as repeated investigations have
shown, already are hiding their beliefs
and working for the party under
fictitious names. Driving a few more
underground might be preferable to
the continuance of a condition under
which enemies of the State, when
discovered as such, cannot be
touched.”

Frozen Fiihrer. —Anyone feeling the
winter winds a bit nippy these days
might be warmed up a lot by a pas-
sage on Hitler in the lately-published
Goebbels diary: “The Fiihrer, I re-
call, never cared very much for winter.
In the old days we used sometimes
to laugh at his physical revulsion
against frost and snow. For instance,
he could never understand how some
people in spring could look for alti-
tudes where there was still snow for
skiing. Now [March, 1942] his
aversion to winter has received cruel
and terrible vindication. He certainly
never imagined that a time would
come when winter would so unrelent-
ingly take advantage of his instinctive
antipathy and inflict such suffering
upon German troops. All this hap-
pened to a degree hitherto considered
unbelievable.” To which the diarist
added his own heartfelt “This long,
hard, cruel winter be damned!”

Leader for Canada. Invitations
have gone out to some 1800 dele-
gates throughout Canada to attend a
Liberal-party national convention
from August 5 to 7 to elect a new
leader to replace Prime Minister Mac-
kenzie King. It will be the first such
convention since back 'in the com-
paratively bright ages of 1919, when
King was himself elected leader; in
fact, it will be only the third in the
party’s history; the first was held in
1893. N. Y. “Times” Ottawa corre-
spondent names as hottest present tip

ternal Affairs Louis St. Laurent.

U.S. “Primaries.” Though in
general U.S. Presidential “primaries”
are as already described here (B.
28/4/’4B), some of them have pecu-
liarities that have a bearing on results.
For instance, in the Wisconsin
“primary” Stassen apparently secured
19 delegates to support him at the
Republican June convention to elect
the party’s Presidential candidate,
while MacArthur secured eight and
Dewey none. But, as George E.
Sokolsky points out in N. Y. “Sun,”
in Wisconsin (as distinct from other
States, where “primaries” are one-
party affairs) “a Democrat may vote
in the Republican primary and vice
versa,” and “this makes it possible for
the opposition party to help destroy
the stronger candidates in order to
face a weaker man on election day.’
This means that both the favoring
of Stassen and the absence of sup-
port for Dewey, as far as Wisconsin
goes, could be misleading. MacArthur
is a different case, since support for
him was everywhere expected to be
overwhelming jn the Wisconsin
“primary.”-

TINPOT "LABOR" TYRANTS.
Alfred Deakin laid it down in 1906
that the Constitutional requirement of
six-year terms for elected Senators could
not be altered without a ratifying refer-
endum ; and there was a ratifying refer-
endum that year.
Accepting Deakin’s reading of the
Constitution, W. M. Hughes in 1915 pro-
posed another alteration of Senatorial
terms by the substitution of a complete
new Constitutional section 13. In a
referendum pamphlet he claimed that “this
amendment” had been “necessitated by
the recd’nt” (i.e., 1914) “double dissolu-
tion,” in that “the House must be dis-
solved before the end of April, 1917” (he
dissolved it on March 23), and “the term
of the new Senate is cut short”:
The amendment will lengthen the life of the
three-years Senators [i.e., the fourth, fifth
and sixth Senators elected for each State in
1914] by two months, and of the six-
years Senators by four months.
This section [l3] has already been
amended. In 1907 [really December, 1906]
the Deakin Government asked the people
to extend the life of the then existing Senate
for six months, and the people agreed.
As it happened, Mr. Hughes didn’t re-
fer the question to the electors —it was
to have been one of seven questions.
Yielding to Opposition protests against
dividing the nation and exploiting war
sentiment to secure a party advantage—
protests renewed in 1944 and recklessly
rejected by the Chifley-Evatts, to their
subsequent discomfiture—he called off
his referendum. Nor did he try to get
the Senators’ terms altered by Act of Par-
liament. He knew too much for that.
The crowd at present in office has very
little knowledge of anything, but thinks
it knows everything. Relying on a Con-
stitutional section, 14, of limited appli-
cation, and ignoring section seven and sec-
tion .13, as altered by the people’s vote in
1906, it proposes to create 81 new seats
(82 with the one promised to the civil
servants in the A.C.T.), not to promote the
public good but to keep control of the
House, if it can, and if that hope has
to be abandoned —it is almost abandoned
now —to retain a majority in the Senate.
This would mean a great increase of
public expenditure; about £400,000 a
year in salaries and “perks” alone. It
would mean also the consolidation of city
rule in general matters of government and
Communist rule in the domains of trans-
port and industry (N. S. Wales and Vic-
toria would have 80 full-voting Ms.H.R..
and the other States 41, and most of the
121 wpuld come from cities), a fantastic
over-representation of Tasmania and a
thwarting of the claims to Statehood of
great communities like the people of
Riverina, New England, Central and
North Queensland, who, if they lived in
America, would have had their own
States long ago. It would leave Aus-
tralia without a Federal system and with
only the faults of a unitary system, and
would most probably lead to secession
movements. But in “Labor’s” fear oi;
what would otherwise be coming to it,
and in its devouring desire for office and
a wider distribution of plums, these grave
considerations it cynically dismisses.
Section 14 says “Whenever the number
of Senators for a State is increased or
diminished the Parliament may make
such provision for the vacating of the
places of Senators for the State as it
deems necessary to maintain regularity in
the rotation.” “A State,” “the State,”
“increased or diminished” —significant
and limiting words, especially as it is pro-
vided in section seven that “no original
State shall have less than six Senators.”
Section 14 was apparently written into
the Constitution chiefly to enable Par-
liament to take care of a situation aris-
ing out of the admission of new States
without compulsion to grant them
six Senators apiece'. But “Labor” chooses
to construe it as applying to all the exist-
ing States, though their Senate represen-
tation can in no case be “diminished,”
and as empowering it to call into exist-
ence 24 more Senators, with, like the
present mob, little to do and lots of
money for doing it, and to decide when
they shall begin to sit and for how long.
To decide also that “sixth” and “seventh”
Senators re-elected next year (election of
40 is proposed) shall go out on July 1,
1953. And all in contempt of the Con-
stitution requirement of six-years terms.
beginning in the case of a new man on
the first day of July following election.
“Labor” aims at going further. So
that it may prolong its Senate majority
until June 30, 1953, at least, it has
brought in a delirious P.R. plan vesting
vast powers in the Commonwealth Elec-
toral Officer:
Section 3, subsection 8: If on any count
two or more candidates have an equal
number of votes the Commonwealth
Electoral Officer shall decide which shall
be excluded If, at the time of their
election, two or more candidates have an
equal number of votes, the Commonwealth
Electoral Officer shall decide the order of
election of those candidates.
In effect, the Commonwealth Electoral
Officer may arbitrarily rule out any can-
didate tying with another (say a Laborite
with a Liberal) at any stage of a pro-
gressive qpunt; and should two others tie
for fifth and sixth places (again Liberal
or C.P. and Labor) he may arbitrarily
declare that one shall sit for six years
and the other for three years. And where
“a long casual vacancy is to be filled” (that
is, a vacancy caused by death, retirement,
expulsion, bankruptcy, imprisonment “fox-
one year or longer,” proved holding of
“any office of profit under the Crown”
or “any direct or indirect pecuniary
interest in any” persphal “agreement with
the Public Service” or established
“acknowledgment of allegiance, obedi-
ence or adherence to a foreign Power”)
the Commonwealth Electoral Officer is
authorised to re-examine the ballot-papers
and give the job to the first defeated can-
didate not under any of the disabilities
mentioned who gets “the quota.”
This exorbitant power is placed in the
hands of a non-elected person, together
with the custody of ballot-papers and
freedom to determine what “a long
casual vacancy” may be, by section 4 of
the relevant “Labor” bill. This section, like
the provisions governing the beginning
and end of Senators’ terms, impudently
violates the Constitution —in respect of
casual vacancies, section 15, by virtue of
which, over the years,’4o Senators have
been appointed, among them the present
Minister of Trades and Customs:
If the place of a Senator becomes vacant
before the expiration of his term of service,
the Houses of Parliament of the State for
which he was chosen shall, sitting and
voting together, choose a person to hold
the place until the expiration of the term,
or until the election of a successor....
whichever first happens.
If “Labor” gets away with this repudi-
ation and with the “nationalisation” of
the trading banks and carries the Prices
and Charges Referendum as well, there
will be little left to the States but shadow
Parliaments and insolvent departments— ~
because of frenzied Canberra finance they
are all fast drifting into insolvency—and
there will be no new States such as have
contributed to the majestic strength of the
American Union. Instead of government
by the people we shall have a city-fed
tyranny tempered by the despotisms of
Communism and bureaucracy. There
will be no longer a Federation except in
name. The cities will go on accumulating
and the country will go on decaying.
Such liberties as remain to us will be at
the mercy of a clique in a Caucus, the
central committee of the Communist
party and the multitude of tinpot tyrants
enthroned in public positions.
Referendum Voters' ABC.
Just as the Prices Referendum campaign
is beginning, a Chifley Minister has blown
the gaff. Thus Mr. Pollard—on Anzac
Eve, too —at a “Labor” Day dinner at
Ballarat, having extolled the socialisation
scheme as initiated by the Bank Grab
Act:
We will go on and on until eventually
in Australia we have a great co-operative
Commonwealth... .its wealth operated in
a socialistic manner for our people as ,a
whole.
“On and on,” then, for the sake of
socialism and nothing else (and let’s be
frank about it), with the effort for per-
manent control under the Canberra
bureaucracy of all prices and charges (if
the referendum appeal succeeds), the
nationalisation of medicine and doctors,
and all the rest of it.
Mr. Pollard’s anticipation is quite in
accord with the plan for “socialisation in
'JO years’ time” as drawn up at the
A.L.P. conference at Sydney in June,
1944, and set in motion at a special con-
ference at Canberra in 1945. But in the
process “Labor” members and even
Ministers are contradicting each other,
“explaining” each other and facing dif-
ferent ways, mostly according to the esti-
mate of danger to their seats. From this
last arises the Chifley legislation to enlarge
Parliament in order to completely (and
“safely”) realign the electorates, which
also is part of the 1945 plan of operations.
Some amusing examples of the con-
fusion in the “Labor” ranks are worth
quoting. Mr. Pollard produced this out
of his Ballarat bran-tub:
The greatest problem in the trade-union
movement is the reconciling of Right-wing
elements undermining the ranks. Some of
them should have been supporters of the
U.A.P.-Liberal party. They are a Right
Tory wing, and but for them there would
not be a Conservative Government in any
State in Australia.
That is, a Government opposed to the 10-
years socialisation plan. By no means
agreeing with Mr. Pollard, a member of
the A.L.P. executive, Mr. C. Griffiths,
writing in “S. M. Herald” a short time
ago an official apology for the Bank
Grab Act, declared:
To the disappointment of Labor the
Communists have mischievously adopted
hank nationalisation as their 1947 tactic.
Labor is disappointed because the Com-
piunist intrusion has created a fear in the
community that there is a relationship be-
tween bank nationalisation and Communist
policy.
And this, said the “Labor” apologist,
was, “if the Communists were genuinely
supporting the Government’s proposals,
indiscreet.” Against this idiotic but very
revealing special pleading it is necessary
only to place Lenin’s own words when he
was inaugurating his revolution:
We are all agreed that the fundamental
first step in this direction [implementing
Communism] must measures as
the nationalisation of the banks We
cannot at once nationalise the small con-
sumers’ concerns, that is with one or two
employees, nor can we at once place them
under a real workers’ control. But through
the nationalisation of the banks they can
be tied hand and foot.
As a matter of recorded fact, the
Moscow-forced Communist regime in
Hungary last November was also nation-
alising all the banks in that subjugated
State at the very moment Mr. Chifley
was. putting his Bank Grab Bill through
the House of Representatives.
Another Minister, Senator Armstrong,
chimed in at a “Labor” regional con-
ference at Goulburn (as “S. M. Herald”
reported him) with:
The Bank Nationalisation Act will be
brought into effect by other means if
the High Court holds the'Act to be un-
constitutional. There are men of reasonable
ingenuity in the Cabinet,
For an interpretation of “reasonable
ingenuity” the electors may be referred
to Mr. Dedman, speaking in the House
on the Parliament Bill, who said “it is
immaterial that the Government did not
mention the proposal during the last elec-
tion campaign A Government elected
with a blank cheque is entitled to do all
it can.” Which was exactly the excuse
originally brought out by Mr. Chifley
for his Bank Bill till he perceived that
that argument was, like the Communists’
adherence, “indiscreet.” With a blank
cheque the Government is going ahead,
whether the people agree or not. Mr.
Chifley used precisely that phrase in his
second-reading speech on the Referen-
dum Bill. “We believe,” he said,
“whether the people agree or not, that
they should be protected.”
By “protecting the people” Mr. Chifley
professes to mean protecting them from
inflation of the currency and an economic
depression. But “Labor” spokesmen
don’t agree, nor do the economists
agree with them.
One of Mr. Chifley’s favorites, Mr.
“Bill” Taylor, whose graduation to the
late Commonwealth Bank board and
then to vice-chairmanship of the Air-
lines Commission astonished his fellow-
wayfarers on the primrose path, has
declared on behalf of the Prime Minister
that “nationalisation of the banks would
not prevent a depression, but would
cushion its effects.” That same recom-
mendation is treated with contemptuous
scorn as the Communist propaganda by
the A.L.P.’s Mr. Griffiths: — §
The Communist party’s plea today that
bank nationalisation will cushion the effects
of overseas and local depression is so much
poppycock.
Of course it is, whoever says it. What
Communist president Sharkey said at the
Victorian elections last December was
very different. He gave out the true
milk of the word, as preached at the
Federal A.L.P. Conference of 1945 when
it was preparing the first step in “sociali-
sation in 10 years’ time.” - He said:
Bank nationalisation is only the com-
mencement, but a very important com-
mencement, the most important ever taken
by the Labor movement here. We must
support it.
Yet another Minister, Mr. Calwell —his
sea,t is as safe as a bank used to be—was
bold enough to declare of the Bank Grab
Act—“We are in the process of plucking
the fowl, and not one feather can be put
back.” The fowls to be plucked at the
Prices Referendum will be the gullible
among the electors, and if the vote should
be “Yes” the evil done there too can never
be undone. The people to be plucked
on May 29 are being lulled with the
grossly false assertion that “you are not
being asked to vote for permanent price-
control” because “the prices power will
become essentially a reserve poWer.” A
reserve power! So was the socialisation
plan a reserve plan at the last elections.
What they are after, these Socialist-
planners and their Communist allies, is
to make permanent the temporary sur-
render of freedoms to which the public
acquiesced during the war. Dr. Evatt told
the country in 1944, the date when the
A.L.P. plan for “socialisation in 10 years”
was decided on:
The right of the individual to choose
his own vocation and employment is only
one of the freedoms which the Australian
people must forgo in the interests of the
State.
Every elector who enters a polling-
booth to vote “Yes” or “No” this month
on the Chifley Socialist Government’s
plea for permanent transfer of control
over prices from the States to the Com-
monwealth ought to paste that warning
in his hat. Mr. Lang’s version of it is:
Before he [Mr. Chifley] can enforce in-
dustrial conscription in peace-time he must
have absolute control of banking. By that
means he hopes to obtain the economic
powers that he has been denied by the
people through referendum.
Private enterprise and employment are
to be smashed by the operation from
Canberra of price-fixing and form-filling
—by which any Government department
can make life intolerable for selected
industrial victims —just as the trading
banks are to be smashed by the Bank
Grab Act. Thereafter the rest of “social-
isation in 10 years’ time” would be rela-
tively easy, with “Labor” able to go “on
and on” and eliminate in Parliament all
other political parties. Except the Com-
munists, who would, of course, ultimately
consume “Labor.”
By-Election.
There is to be an AsSbmbly by-election
for Coogee (Sydney) on Saturday, and
“Labor” has nominated Mrs. L, L. Cun-
ningham, An unfortunate flaw in the
liaison work led to the lady’s being ad-
vertised as the official party candidate
two days before she was officially chosen
as such from a panel of three. “Labor”
couldn’t afford to let that happen in a
constituency like Coogee, anti-“ Labor”
as it was for many years. And with a
chronic grievance against “Labor”—about
the worst tram service in Sydney, and
that means Australia.
As a member’s widow Mrs. Cunning-
ham qualified for a life pension, and the
qualification will return to her if she fails
of election. This provision was made for
Assemblymen and their wives at the
conclusion of the Japanese war. Not one
“Labor” Assemblyman or Councillor was
a combatant in 1939-45, but “Labor” de-
cided that Assemblymen’s contribution to
the Jap war—principally the setting-up of
a Sydney racing club—warranted pay-
ments on retirement or death exceeding
those granted to desperately-wounded
servicemen and war widows. Mr. Cun-
ningham, who gave part of his time to
the directorship of a racing club, was a
member in two (1941-47) Parliaments and
a bit of a third. He could have resigned
six months ago and claimed £5 a year
for the rest of his life. His sudden death
entitled his widow to £3 a week for
the rest of her life.
The Legislative Assembly Members’
Pensions Bill, as originally introduced, re-
quired an expectant beneficiary to pay £1
a week into the “provident fund,” so-
called—the major provision is, of course,
charged up to taxpayers —out of his then
salary of £875 p.a., which was far more
than the salary paid to any State or pro-
vincial member in the U.S.A. or Canada.
Murmurs from dissatisfied people
prompted a change of plans, but not be-
fore the 1947 State elections were safely
negotiated. Thereupon the weekly con-
tribution was increased to 30s. And there-
upon members’ salaries were raised to
£1375 and Ministers’ salaries to £2445,
£5OO p.a. in each case, with “conse-
quential” rises for “officers.” This when
vast additions to Government transport
fares and freight-rates had become ines-
capable, the “Government” being what
it is, by way of bridging the gap between
consolidated revenue and consolidated
expenditure, a gap becoming wider.
The “Government” which showered
life pensions on a privileged few would
be unique among English-speaking Ad-
ministrations if it hadn’t a likeminded
partner at Canberra. It crawls to Commu-
nists as only the Chifley “Government”
crawls in wider fields. Like the Chifley
“Government,” it is politically destitute or
moral principle and intestinal fortitude. It
is applauded only by the Booze and Bet-
ting interests. Its housing and soldier-
settlement record is almost a blank. Under
what passes for “Labor” rule the people
can never be sure of getting the neces-
saries of life, dear as most of them are.
Chiefly because the “Government” is wit-
less as well as spineless, they have known
what it is to go without milk, sugar, pota-
toes, coal, coke, gas, electric light, power,
radio, transport, hospital and X-ray
attention and even beer. This winter
they are to go without current pad or
the time and without radiators all the
time ; and they are threatened with in-
vasion of their homes by “inspectors,
£5OO fines for “offences,” and workless
days without pay.
But brag is always at “Labor’s sen^ e >
and Premier McGirr boasted recently tna
he commanded 52 votes in a H° use wlt r
90. He should be one vote down, an
two on a division, next week.


PLAIN ENGLISH
U.N.O. in Collapse.
Palestine is merely confirming the lesson
’ learnt in Greece—U.N.O.’s authority
simply does not count in the world. The
chief Powers within its membership can’t
even agree to finish off the late war by
giving peace to the “liberated” peoples.
The first cause of collapse is that the
Russians do not understand the work-
ing of a society governed by Parlia-
mentary debate. They regard U.N.O. as
an international —hostile, because a rival,
to the Communist International —and
have been devoting their efforts to sabot-
aging it from within. That other inter-
national, the Roman Catholic Church,
Russia regards in the same light. Inter-
national Jewry Moscow is trying to
proselytise.
Mr. L. B. Pearson, Canadian Ambas-
sador at Washington, has expressed in
plain language the courses open to U.N.O.
It can just drift into impotence, it
can be disbanded, or it can be re-
organised around those nations which
really mean to make it tick. As it is
today, U.N.O. is’useless. Russia won’t
let it work. Other Powers can’t get its
“police force” into being. The small
nations don’t want to carry any burdens.
The Marshall Plan is now taking its
place in western Europe, and the Atlantic
Powers, large and small, are entering into
a union of their own. An Anglo-
American treaty is imminent which will
defend their Western Union against all
aggressors. The limited objectives of
this smaller United Nations are:
Restoration of Western European
economy.
Security of the Mediterranean and the
Atlantic approaches.
Maintenance'of peace in the regions of
■ r those nations who will work for it.
Any States which * desire \p adhere to
this peace club will have to qualify and
be vetted. There is nothing in the rules
that offers any prospects for seekers after
limelight.
"Support Mr. De Valera."
On his world tour, with everything paid
and dollars to burn, Senator Amour
tarried in Eire and was interviewed by
one “S.O’H.” for the “Clare Champion.”
“S.O’H.” didn’t get the name right, call-
ing the buckshee tourist Senator
“L’Amour,” but he was all there with
compliments: «
Were it not for that strongly-marked
Australian accent, Senator L’Amour Would
easily pass in one of our towns or cities
as a native of the soil; a well-built genial
man in the middle fifties, but vigorous as
befits one who has travelled far over land
and sea, and by air also, in his time.
Senator “L’Amour’s” travels by air were
interrupted at San Francisco/ where,
according to his own account, he “struck
a match to light a cigarette, just through
want of thought,” with the result that
“the captain of the aircraft refused to take
me on and put my luggage off.” But
this regrettable incident the “Clare Cham-
pion” man could not possibly have fore-
seen. He was concerned only with
Senator “L’Amour’s” appearance and
confidences, one of which, as he reported
it, must have delighted him:
Although our people are mostly of British
descent, they have no particular liking for
British or Americans. The Irish are popu-
lar with us and make good citizens.
A most invidious utterance on the part
of a Senator whose name signifies Luv.
Most certainly the Irish are “popular”—
two present State Premiers and five Prime
Ministers since 1929 have claimed Irish
origin—but if Irish emigration to Aus-
tralia is renewed (there has been little
for 30 years), most Australians would
rather the emigrants didn’t bring
Irish politics with them. They would
hate to go back to the days when the
Wrongs of Ireland were an issue in Aus-
tralian politics. But it seems from a
Sydney “Morning Herald” Parliamentary
report that Senator Amour, the cigarette-
lighter, burns to revive them:
Senator S. K. Amour (Lab., N.S.W.)
said he hoped the Government would use
whatever influence it had to support Mr.
de Valera in his attempts to end the par-
tition of Ireland.
Well, if we must have this infliction,
how about commissioning Dr. Evatt to
“support Mr. De Valera”? Mr. McGirr
has been baited by the Opposition into
dragging the Evatt prices-and-charges
referendum into the Coogee by-election.
A speech by Dr. Evatt on (1) the iniquity
of partition in Ireland, and (2) the sweet
reasonableness of partition in Palestine
would liven up the Coogee campaign as
nothing else could.
"Free Bottle of Medicine."
A year ago it was asked in these columns,
in comment on the N.Z. free-medicine
scheme; “Will another enthusiast have to
Write the same lament on the Australian
scheme as Dr. Douglas Robb has written
on the scheme in New Zealand?”
Chifley’s Senator McKenna has for
12 months or more been marking-time
with his jigsaw game of nationalising the
Australian medical profession, while try-
ing to make it look something lovelier
and bptter than the awful mess made in
Maoriland. No doubt he also waited
to see if Aneurin Bevan in the U.K.,
similarly engaged, could provide him with
any points.
Australian doctors have bucked—just as
their fellow-professionals bucked in N.Z.
and in Britain —against the requirement
that they shall write all patients’ prescrip-
tions from a set formulary of certain
drugs and mixtures, and on departmental
prescription-forms. In neither of those
other countries could a socialist Govern-
ment carry the day against the doctors,
and they are unlikely to succeed here.
This, however, is only the fringe of
the New Order. The fussing McKenna
allows it to be announced that the annual
cost to the taxpayers will be “£2,000,000
a year.” Well, the Australian population
is near 1$ millions, and in N.Z. (popula-
tion 1,691,000, including Maoris, in 1946)
the free medical and hospital services for
that year cost over 5$ million pounds.
At that rate the comparative cost in Aus-
tralia would be over 24i millions on
1945-46 values. Does McKenna main-
tain that only £2,000,000 of this would be
used in free medicine? Why, contempor-
aneously with the first mention of his
scheme as imminent last year, costs of
medical drugs went up something like 50
per cent.
Dr. Douglas Robb, who last year
slated the N.Z. scheme, is an eminent
surgeon and medical councillor of Auck-
land. He is an enthusiast for national
organisation of health care, based on
health-centres (after the British scheme’s
pattern) in which groups of doctors would
work co-operatively, each centre being
equipped with “a complete set of facili-
ties from a full-length base-hospital
downward.” But this shoddy free-medi-
cine idea, “political in its conception and
ignoring professional considerations,” he
abjured with scorn:
Many medical leaders were trying to
wean both people and doctors away from
their addiction to the old style and methods
with their inevitable bottle of medicine.
The Social Security Act has confirmed the
old methods and entrenched their already
vested interests with richer rewards than
ever Not indefinitely can a system of
rewards be justified in which a doctor newly
qualified can earn double or even treble
the salary of a professor of medicine.
“Doctors in N.Z.,” he declared, after
experience of the scheme over eight years,
“have become extraordinarily prosperous
... .The emphasis is placed on the num-
ber of acts done (fee per service) rather
than on quality trifling things that
ought to be done by a nurse or secretary.”
How easy it is, by prescribing with
Government consent (indeed at Govern-
ment instigation), a bottle of medicine,
to dismiss a patient; no fee paid, but a
voucher signed for a draft on the Gov-
ernment, and then a bottle of physic
from the chemist in exchange for a simi-
lar chit. Cost, says McKenna airily,
£2,000,000 a year—or about six-bobs’-
worth per annum for every man, woman
and baby in the Commonwealth! Does
anybody believe him?
Queensland Freights.
Unlike the McGirrs, of Sydney, who
first put out a feeler on increased fares
and then hurriedly remembered an im-
minent by-election and recalled it, the
Hanlons of Brisbane have made no bones
about telling Queenslanders that they’re
in for the second increase in rail fares
and a year, this time by
an overall 12| per cent.
Suburban-fare increases last year made
rail fares generally higher than tram and
bus fares, so the new rise will apply only
to return fares, generally increasing them
by 1$ p.c., with/a minimum of Id. The
July, 1947, increase was 10 p.c. in freights
and fares. The new freights go up like
this: .
On butter, hides, stock, bran, pollard,
raw sugar, bags and bales, 22$ p.c.; wool,
15; building materials and cement, 225;
bricks, glass, ashes and sand, 21$; log
timber, 30; coal, bottles, bark, 37-1; iron
and steel, wire, machinery, 225; iron ore
and some minerals, 21$; groceries, spirits,
engines, drapery, cars, baths, bedding and
china, 7 s.
Transport Minister Duggan justified
the increases in the usual way—wage in-
creases and “improved conditions” for rail
employees are to cost another £3,185,0Q0
a year, marginal and basic-wage increases
are expected to add another £900,000, with
more additions from overtime for week-
end work. This, of course, is the excuse
in all States where freights and fares
have jumped, but it doesn’t excuse the
general deterioration in the attitude of
Government rail employees towards their
job and the travelling and consigning
public—which, for its part, wouldn’t mind
the increases so much if, in return, it got
efficient and reliable service, was saved
the losses from damage and pillage
on rail-freighted goods, and could be
sure the railways wouldn’t be idle a large
part of the year through strikes.
That Snowy Diversion.
Mr. Weir, N.S.W. Minister for Conser-
vation, is “urging” his leader, Mr. Mc-
Girr, to go to the Premiers’ Conference
in July and “insist” that the Snowy River
waters be diverted into the Murrum-
bidgee. This, says Mr. Weir, would pro-
duce a hydro-electric power output of
J!50,000 kilowatts and irrigate 4,000,000
acres of “parched land” south and west
of the existing Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Areas. There is another scheme—a Vic-
torian one —to divert the Snowy into the
Murray, develop 600,000 kilowatts and
send the water on for use along the en-
tire Murray system. A Commonwealth
committee examined both and found
that, for a capital expenditure of
£44,540,000, the Murray diversion would
produce power and water the capitalised
value of which would be £42,600,000 in
excess of the total capitalised cost of the
works, whereas the scheme gave
£14,400,000 and £570,000 respectively.
To anyone but a State politician with
a parochial mind the vast difference be-
tween those figures would suggest that
the diversion proposals demand thorough
investigation not by politicians but
by engineers, agriculturalists, irrigators,

economists, soil-scientists and geographers
of the highest qualifications. True, the
Snowy waters are now being wasted, but #
it is also, true that their use is a national,*
not a State* matter. In that sense the
Snowy is no more a N.S.W. preserve
than is the Mitta a Victorian one.
South Australia has as big an interest
as' anyone else. All that saved S.A.
Murray settlements in the 1944 drought,
when Hume Dam was practically empty,
was a big Darling flow, a freakish rescue
which may never be repeated. And S.A.,
in addition to its Murray settlements,
runs Murray water by pipeline from
Morgan through its settled north and
right round to Whyalla, a steel and ship-
building town of 8000 people which
couldn’t exist without it. Gallonage
through the pipeline for the year 1945:
247,743,000 to Whyalla, 20,472,000 to
Morgan-Hanson district, 510,000,000 to
Beetaloo system (158,000,000 of that to
Port Pirie), 85,370,000 to Port Augusta,
42.273.000 to Commonwealth Railways,
6.541.000 to S.A. Railways, 6,616,000 to
private consumers.
If the Premiers do discuss diversion of
the Snowy at their conference it can at
best be on a political plane. The thing
is too big to be rushed at bull-headed,
and far more people are involved
than Mr. Weir appears to realise. Aus-
tralia has paid heavily for the old mistake
of allowing the Murray to become a State
border ; it will make a bigger one if city
politicians play round with huge under-
takings of this nature purely for their own
parochial interests. In any case, the
Snowy can wait. Far more urgent things
need the attention of the Mr. Weirs —
notably housing, transport improvement,
soldier - settlement, existing irrigation
problems of salting, waterlogging and
soil-depletion. For a Premier to go to
his fellow-Premiers talking glibly of kilo-
watts when his own city suffers almost
daily electricity blackouts from prevent-
able causes is as absurd as a Government
“urging” vast river-diversion schemes
while it keeps on losing millions on its
own transport system.
POLITICAL POINTS
The Old Girl doubtless didn’t mean
anything by it, and in these days of
newsprint shortage it is hard to fit every-
thing in, but there are bound to be ill-
natured people who put a wrong interpre-
tation on the juxtaposition of two items
published in “S. M. Herald” last Friday.
At the bottom of a column summarising
Blain’s charges against Evatt and Rose-
vear was a small paragraph headed
“Drive on Dingoes.” The reference was
to a campaign against wild dogs.
A “Time” sneer at the crypto-com-
munist Mrs. Jessie Street, described as
of the Status of Women Commission
of the United Nations (what labels these
excrescences have!), brought an indignant
letter from the lady, signed as below:
(Mrs.) Jessie M. G. Street,
Australian Mission to the United States,
New York City.
Another indefensible waste of dollars.
Hers? Ours? Whose?
With the coal shortage desperate
N.S.W. “Labor” had a coalminer prose-
cuted for working when he had turned
60. How characteristic, especially when
there is no age-limit for “Labor” poli-
ticians ; and Canberra has some, as well
as Hughes (rising 84), who are old
enough, and others nearly old enough,
to have been the sacked and fined coalie’s
father. Collings owns to 83. Ward, the
Senator —not the Minister who said “the
U.S.S.R. has made more progress in 25
years than any capitalist country has made
in ten times that period”—will be 75 on
May 11, according to Who's Who. On
The Bulletin staff is a middle-aged
Young Digger who went to school when
Ward’s son was about to leave the same
seminary.
Coogee (Sydney) electors must be in-
quisitive on the subject of whether Mrs.
Cunningham, the “Labor” candidate,
could put in for the £3-a-week pension
guaranteed to a widow of an Assembly-
man if she succeeds him as member, at
£1375 a year. There is no Constitutional
impediment. Under the N.S.W. Constitu-
tion, Leg. Assembly membership is refused
to persons “holding pensions during plea-
sure or for a term,” but to such persons
the Legislative Assembly Members’ Pen-
sions Act does not apply. However, the
Act itself contains a barring clause; but
if Mrs. Cunningham is defeated she can
claim the pension.
A question persistently dodged in the
House by Dr. Evatt was put in plain
terms at U.N.O. by the Secretary of
State for the Colonies, Creech-Jones:
Delegates who insist on retention of
the decision for partition in Palestine must
face squarely and honestly the question:
“Are their Governments prepared to par-
ticipate? ”
This was Britain’s reply to an “Austra-
lian” resolution—naturally “assured of
strong backing from the Russian bloc”—
demanding partition immediately, if not
sooner; and no mention of any Austra-
lian contingent. In the House Dr. Evatt
had the face to declare “Australia” was
co-operating with Britain. It is “co-
operating” much as: the English captain
will “co-operate” with Bradman in the
Test matches which the doctor is to see.
It will be a pity if the tax- and divi-
dend-paying A.N.A. throws in the sponge
in the general fight of Australian com-
mercial enterprise against Government
monopoly. The euphemism of “ration-
alisation” has been used to describe its
discussions with Canberra, and all the talk
of petrol shortage, dollar savings, pro-
curement of spare-parts, resumption of
aerodrome facilities, and so forth, conveys
methods of political pressure now
familiar. Taxpayers are directly inter-
ested. T.-A.A. lost £500,000 and the
British Government airlines £10,000,000
in a twelvemonth. /
Stan the Rover Amour, joining in the
Senate debate on foreign affairs, an-
nounced that he had “looked at the world
in various ways.” It must be a curious
spectacle when viewed through a Coca-
Cola bottle and the.smoke of a cigarette
puffed, “for want of thought,” in a plane.
That little “mimicking Molotov”
Brown, of the A.R.U., has been heard
front again. Victorian “Labor” is terribly
afraid that he will start something just
as the prices-and-charges referendum cam-
paign gets into full swing, especially as
the Hollway Government is going to
introduce anti-Commo legislation. Surely
a groundless fear this time ; all Commos
are Yes-men.
Apropos of that Sunday-paper picture
of Chifley as another Lincoln (B.
28/4/’4B), Americans have been going
through Lincoln papers hoarded by his
son and released at the appointed time
after the son’s death. In one justly-
praised document the martyred President
laid down what he thought should be
procedure in cases of persons accused
of disloyalty in time of war:
Regular trials in duly-constituted courts,
under the form and all the substantial pro-
visions of law and of the Constitution.
Worthy of a man who was truly great.
Chifley was No, 3 in a Government
which arrested the Australia Firsters,
some of them elderly men of blameless
antecedents, others wounded Diggers of
the First World War, and all guilty of
nothing more than a policy which
“Labor” itself espoused for a genera-
tion. The Army Minister defamed them
under cover of privilege, employing Mos-
cow jargon. Communist papers published
their names and claimed that the “Gov-
ernment” had acted on Communist re-
presentations. The men were held in
internment camps for many months with-
out being brought to trial, though a trial
been promised by the P.M* One of
the wounded Diggers died shortly after
his release; another’s mother died, broke
as well as broken-hearted, while her son
was in durance vile. When a third victim
sued for damages—his wife and children
had been impoverished and persecuted
during the loss of their breadwinner,
whose flourishing business was wrecked —
the Chifley “'Government” pleaded the
equivalent of the Gaming Act. Another
Lincoln? Good God!
Taking the wind out of the Chifley-
Evatt sails, Hollway is legislating for rent-
control, and McGirr has, though reluct-
antly, promised price-control if the
Chifley-Evatt craft founders. As it will.
In the Victorian Landlord and Ten-
ant Bill, rents are pegged at December
31, 1940, levels, and penalties are
drastic. Anybody who demands “key-
money” or bets a prospective ten-
ant a tenner or a hundred that he
can’t jump over his own hat or exchanges
goodwill or goods in connection with a
lease or tenancy, renders himself liable
to a fine of £5O or six months in “the
cooler,” and amounts so paid are legally
recoverable as debts. There are also
penalties for a landlord who refuses
premises to a man with a child or children.
Appeals against the rent-controller’s
decisions go to a police magistrate “with-
out costs,” and there may be another
appeal to the Supreme Court, but only
on. questions of law. Cain asked for an
adjournment of the debate to enable the
Opposition to study the bill, but Oldham
said it was crystal-clear, and it is.
During the war Melbourne was told
that the occupation of the city by Can-
berra civil servants would cease with
the war and that there would be a move
in the reverse direction. At the end 'of
1945 Federal bureaucrats were still squat-
ting on. 1,000,000 square feet of office
space and more was being requisitioned.
Nobody has bothered to take a census of
the increase since.
The status of the gentlemen who repre-
sent Australia in Moscow and Moscow in
Australia has been raised to that of Am-
bassador. According to the U.S. Armed
Forces Radio the request for this exalta-
tion came from “the Australian Govern-
ment.”
N.S.W. country people wondered what
the State Electricity Authority set up by
the Sydney “Labor” Government was for.
They know now. Under McGirr-Cahill
direction the S.E.A. has been made
responsible for seeing that the people of
Lismore, Dubbo, Parkes, Wagga and a
host of other country towns darken theii
shops and streets and cut out night
sports (“including fetes and carnivals”)
because Bungle-along can’t supply its
County of Cumberland customers. Penal-
ties for “breaches,” £5OO, plus £lO a day,
and another £5OO for “obstructing in-
spectors.” But savage as the “restrictions”
are, they will not prevent the victims hold-
ing meetings at which they can say what
they think of this Sydney racket and the
accompanying Canberra increase -of -
members racket and decide upon protec-
tive measures. There have already been
New State discussions at Armidale.
To Churchill, ds he said to Conserva-
tive members, the idea that a nation can
tax itself into prosperity is a crude de-
lusion. Clearly the man hasn’t studied
the speeches of Chifley, Dedman and
other experts of equal standing.
From Dean Inge’s England, published
in 1938:
Zionism is a romantic ideal with which so
practical a people as the French would not
have meddled. Palestine was not under-
populated ; Jews who are crowding in under
our protection come largely from Russia, where
many of the “Jews” are the descendants of a
horde of Tartars, converted in a mass in the
Middle Ages.
Obviously a subject for the fountain-pen
or A.B.C. voice of Professor Stone, who
wrote in 1944 that “the safety of Im-
perial communications via Suez has been
increased, and that substantially, by the
presence of the young Jewish Homeland.”
He was denouncing Isaac Isaacs, whose
considered view was that Zionism had
adopted the Nazi conception of the
master-race and must inevitably resort to
Nazi methods. Isaacs is gone, but the
Dean remains, though very old. At him,
professor, with another Open Letter!
When Casey was Australian Minister
at Washington in the war days he got
along with a staff of four. Makin is
surrounded by “16 senior officers,” them-
selves surrounded by clerks, chauffeurs,
messengers and domestics. There are, in
addition, a Military Mission, consuts-
generals in New York and San Francisco
and information bureaux in both cities.
Heaven only knows what they all do and
what they all cost in dollars, but Dr.
Evatt remains their hero, if not a hero to
Blain.
Next Sunday is Mothers’ Day. If it is
cold in Sydney next morning—and
winter set in early:—no mother dare
warm herself with a radiator while she
tries to toast Friday’s bread and fry
Friday’s chop and boil milk —if any—and
scrape the bottom of the sugar-bowl—
for a sugar famine impends as an im-
mediate consequence of the Communist
blockade of Queensland, at which Syd-
ney “Labor” connived. If she does turn
on the radiator she may be fined £5OO
under the McGirr-Cahill rationing regu-
lations, and £5OO more if she “obstructs”
aq inspector.
Stale from his exertions in the Strike
that Failed, Comrade O’Brien, president
of the Queensland A.R.U., sought a
spiritual (not spirituous) revival or some-
thing by addressing 150 members of the
University Radical Club, He pleaded that
only five of the 20 members of the “Rail-
way Disputes Committee” were Com-
munists. The students listened politely,
and a Mr. Rowland then moved:
That this meeting requests the Federal
Government to ban the Communist party
and to jail or deport those members who
stir up discontent in industry and passes
a resolution of loyalty to his Majesty and
to his Majesty’s Government in this
country.
Carried overwhelmingly on the voices.
Then, with due and icy decorum, the
club carried a motion “thanking Mr.
O’Brien for attending.”
Two “days” of Canberra:
Back from South Africa, where he found
people bitterly resentful of Our Foreign Policy
as it concerned them, Earle Page moved that
there should be no increase of Senators with-
out a double dissolution, that and other changes
—one abolishing the provision that there should
be half as many Senators as Ms.H.R.—to be
put, necessarily, to a popular vote. He was
supported from the “Labor” side by Maurice
Blackburn’s widow in the most effective speech
she has made in the House. Quietly, but most
impressively, the lady argued that increase of
members could and should be added to the
prices-and-charges referendum, and pointed
out that abolition, not aggrandisement, of the
Senate had been “Labor” policy for many
years; also, that members added 33J p.c. to their
salaries last year on the plea that they had
too much to do and were now cutting electorates
in half to give .them so much less to do. Was
it proposed to reduce salaries accordingly? There
was no reply. Bill passed through all stages
and sent to the Senate.
That day, for the fourth time this year, as
the “Age” mordantly mentioned, the Senate
sat —for an hour and a half. But Friday saw
the Chamber which is to have 24 more members
—to do nothing in particular for £l5OO a
year and the run of everything going— meet for
a brief “discussion” of foreign affairs, with
“Coca-Cola” Amour urging his Palestine-
partition “Government” to back De Valera’s
campaign for the ending of partition in Ireland.
The House was occupied with the Blain debate,
and all A.B.C. subscribers would have liked
to hear it. Only members of 36 families wanted
to hear Amour and friends. The A.B.C. Parlia-
mentary broadcast was given over to the
Senate “proceedings.” Characteristic, though
in this case curious.

EXIDE BATTERIES OF
AUSTRALIA PTY., LTD.. 44 BRIDGE ST., SYDNEY
PERSONAL ITEMS
Professor Griffith Taylor, one time
of the University of Sydney and now
of Toronto, is back in Australia more
convinced than ever that geography is
the chief determining factor in the de-
velopment of mankind and that the sal-
vation of the world lies in the study of
“geopacifics.” Geopacifics is the exact
antithesis of the geopolitics which con-
vinced the Nazis that the narrow-headed
Nordics were the super-race destined to
rule the planet. Time, according to the
professor, is running out, and there may
be no civilisation left inside 20 years
unless universities in Australia and
throughout the world realise the impor-
tance of his particular form of study.
In North America there are over 100
chairs of his science, and Taylor’s own
school in Toronto has 21 lecturers and
professors and more than 1350 students.
Taylor was born in England but brought
up in Sydney, and won a string of prizes
and exhibitions at Sydney and Cambridge
Universities. He was physiographer to
the Commonwealth Weather Service for
10 years and led the western parties of
Scott’s Antarctic expedition. From 1920
to 1928 he was Professor of Geography
at Sydney University; for the next six
years he filled the same post in Chicago.
Since 1935 be has been in Toronto.
To occupy the Ritchie chair of econo-
mics at the University of Melbourne
rendered vacant by the retirement of
Professor Giblin, one of America’s most
brilliant young men, Dr. Benjamin Hig-
gins will fly to Australia in June. A
Canuck, he graduated from the Univer-
sity of Ontario to London University,
where he gained his M.Sc. He then went
to Minnesota as Instructor in Economics
and from there to Harvard. During the
war he was principal economist in the
U.S. Federal Works Agency and worked
With a housing unit on the War Produc-
tion Board. He is Professor of Eco-
nomics at McGill University, Montreal
—a job held for many years by Stephen
Leacock —and is 35.
Another Briton who refuses to believe
the Jeremiahs who wail that Britain is
down and out is Charles Worthington,
returning home in the Orion after three
months in Australia. Last week he told
Sydney’s Millions Club, in a thoughtful
and thought-provoking address; that the
bottom had been touched in the United
Kingdom’s troubles and that she was now
“on the up” again—still with hard times
and difficult problems to face, but never-
theless on the way up- Worthington hails
from Leicester, where he has been a mem-
ber of the City Council since 1936 and
was Lord Mayor in 1945-46. Back in
World War I he was a lieutenant in the
Royal Flying Corps; in the second war
he was controller of Leicester’s Civil De-
fence and also commanded an A.T.C.
squadron. He is a great believer in the
necessity for close co-operation between
Britain and the Dominions. In a practi-
cal way he has had first-hand experience
of this ; his son and daughter received a
considerable part of their education at
Sydney schools,
W. M. Currey, only V.C.-winner to be
elected to the N.S.W. Assembly, died in
Sydney last week at 52. He won his
Cross at Peronne on September 1, 1918,
when “he captured single-handed, under
heavy machine-gun fire, a 77mm. gun
which had been harassing his company ;
later he rushed an enemy strong-post
with a Lewis gun and inflicted many
casualties.” Born at Wallsend in the
Newcastle district, he served with the
53rd Battalion. After his return from
the war he worked with the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment Railways, took a keen interest in
A.L.P. politics and in 1941 became
M.L.A. for Kogarah. Always closely
associated with R.S.L. activities, he took
part in this year’s Anzac Day march in
Sydney ; two days later he collapsed at
Parliament House. His death is ascribed
to heart-failure, but it is safe to say that
in his case, as in those of thousands of
other Old Diggers, war service took many
years off his life.
Pursuits as widely divergent as solici-
tor in Sydney and stud-breeder at Kahlua,
Coolac (N.S.W.), occupy Clifford Minter,
sketched by Heth at the annual dinner of
fellow-breeders of Aberdeen - Angus
cattle. In between Minter is chairman of
directors of Hoyts Theatres, director of
Pacific Coal and the Nestle concern
and president of Kambala Church of
England Foundation School for Girls.
His country interests combine breeding
on Kahlua, one of the country’s most suc-
LIVESTOCK.
cessful A.A. farms —one of his bulls
brought the record price of 850 guineas
at the last Royal Easter Show —and rais-
ing Corriedale stud and flock sheep. Com-
bining organising ability with expert
cattle knowledge, he arranged the re-
cently-completed stud-farm tour of the
Scottish judge of A.A. stock, Joshua Ross-
Taylor.
An ocean tow-parting is at any time a
towing-ship’s headache, but when the
hawser strands on the edge of a cyclone
at 2 o’clock of the middle watch a cap-
tain’s seamanship is severely tested.
Lieutenant-Commander R. J. V. Hodge,
R.A.N., in frigate Condamine was haul-
ing a Navy oil-fuel lighter as heavy as
his ship froiTL Darwin to Fremantle when
her 4iin. towing hawser snapped. Luckily
the wind was off-shore. Hodge brought
his ship alongside the tossing lighter and
kept her there in pitch darkness and
beating rain until a jury-wire was passed.
The tow continued—runtil next night it
parted again. Altogether five breaks oc-
curred before they reached Fremantle the
day after Christmas, with seas so rough
a lee had to *be made inside N.-W. Cape
to pass the lighter’s hungry crew fresh
provisions. Hodge was in cruiser Aus-
tralia when —splendid seamanship again
—she rescued nine of 13 of a crashed
Sunderland’s crew in a full gale in the
North Atlantic, and, as gunnery-officer,
directed the broadsides that crippled a
Vichy, French destroyer and silenced the
guns of a cruiser in Dakar harbor in Sep-
tember, 1940. Condamine was his first
command, and he left her for a spell
ashore in Navy Office. He is now apply-
ing his mathematical mind and know-
ledge of ballistics to the rocket project in
Centralia.
With the death of J. D. Chapman in
tragic circumstances —with his two sons,
he was washed off the rocks while fishing
near Cape Jervis, and drowned —Adelaide
and South Australia lost an engineer of
outstanding ability. He was appointed
City Engineer and Surveyor in Adelaide
last year, after doing the job in an acting
capacity during the absence on war ser-
vice of Brigadier W. C. Veale, now Town
Clerk of Adelaide. Chapman was a son
of a former Professor of Engineering
at Adelaide University ; a brother is S.A.
Railways Commissioner and was formerly
chief engineer of the department.
Mrs. Tineas Gunn, 78 next month and
still leading an active life in Hawthorn,
Melbourne, had the unique experience of
meeting one of her own characters in the
flesh the other day in the person of J.
McLeod, of Angaston (S.A.). The original
Quiet Stockman of We of the Never
Never, he hadn’t seen his “creator” in
the 40-odd years since they met in the
Never Never. He’s 78 too.
Few musicians can lay claim to as
many performances as Adelaide’s lead-
ing ’cellist Harold Parsons, who has 50
years of orchestral playing to his credit.
He began with the Adelaide Grand
Orchestra under the baton of C. J.
Stevens in 1898, and when the Elder Con-
servatorium was established the same
year, became a member of that orchestra
under Hermann Heinecke. He’s a Mus.
Bac., and has been three times abroad,
and since 1907 has been ’cello teacher at
the Elder Conservatorium and associated
with almost every orchestral undertaking
in Adelaide.
Succeeding H. K. Paine as Judge in
the Adelaide Local Court Department,
Leslie Horrocks Haslam has been ad-
ministering law for the past 40 years.
Adelaide-born, he is a son of a former
M.L.C., a product of Prince Alfred Col-
lege and Adelaide Uni., was admitted
to the S.A. Bar in 1908, and was one-time
partner in the legal firm of Homburg and
Melrose. Appointed S.M. at ' Mount
Gambier in 1920, he transferred to the
Adelaide Police Court as magistrate in
’23, and has been Acting-Judge in the
S.A. Insolvency and the Adelaide Local
Courts since 1935. He’s 64, and an Old
Digger.
“Oscalusa”: The awful North again.
Recently a daughter was born to Mr. and
Mrs. D. O’Donoghue, in Mossman, North
Queensland. The babe is a great-great-
grandchild of Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, who
arrived in Townsville from Yorkshire in
1873, reared a large family, and is still
hale and hearty at 99. Five generations
of the family are still going strong.
Being handed large is no new
experience for E. Glanville Hicks, who
got a £lOOO specimen of the genus as a
token of gratitude from admirers at a
farewell dinner in Melbourne on his re-
tirement from the job of secretary of the
Lord Mayor’s Fund. Starting 25 years ago
with no paper, no typewriter and no
office, this organising wizard left his
charge with over £2,000,000 collected and
distributed for the Lord Mayor and half
a million for the Red Cross. His job had
ups and downs, however. On one occa-
sion a deficit vanished when a cheque
for £15,000 came from Edward Naylor,
Mayor of Prahran. Two more came
during the depression from George and
A. M. Nicholas for £lO,OOO. His biggest
break was when Lord Nuffield invited
him to lunch and prefaced the repast with
an hors-d’oeuvre of £25,000.
Charlie Louey, 70-year-old vendor of
peanuts and dim-sims in Melbourne
offices, is on his way home to China. Un-
like many of his countrymen, Charlie is
going home to get well —not to join his
ancestors. Last year he was knocked
down by a motor-car and has been absent
from city offices for many months.
Left last week for Scotland, via U.S.A.,
after visiting old friends in Australia,
Randal Kincaid, sketched below by Prior.
The old friends included the engines of
motor-vessels Manoora, Bulolo and Mal-
aita, which were made in the engineering-
works of John G. Kincaid and Co.,
MARINE ENGINES.
Greenock. He is chairman of Kincaid’s,
as well as a director of British Polar
Engine Co., of Govan, Glasgow, and the
Ardrossan Dry Dock Company. Thirty-
five years ago he came in through
Sydney -Heads in the Vimiera, but he
didn’t see much of the Heads —as fourth
engineer he was well down below. This
time he had a better vantage-point—the
bridge of the Stratheden. While in this
country Kincaid visited shipbuilding-
yards and engineering-works in several
States and was equally impressed with
the standard of the work and the warmth
of the hospitality he and his wife re-
ceived. He’s hot pessimistic about the
future of British industry. His own
firm has sufficient orders to keep it
going at full pressure till the end of
1951 ; shortage of skilled labor is the
biggest headache.
H. A. Lindsay’s first job was clerking
for Elder Smith’s, but ill-health forced
him to go bush, where he tried his hand
at all manner of things from droving to
editing a country paper. After some
years of roaming he became a migratory
beekeeper; he then bought a property
with the idea of settling down, but when
he was rejected for the A.I.F. in 1939 he
went to Adelaide to do munition work.
When the V.D.C. was formed he joined
as a bushcraft instructor, transferring to
the A.I.F. in 1942. In this job he travelled
from one army unit to another all over
Australia, teaching the troops how to find
water, food and generally fend for them-
selves in the bush. He was often bor-
rowed by the U.S. Army; his overseas
service included 18 months in New
Guinea and New Britain. Lindsay’s first
Bulletin par. was printed when he was
16 ; he has been a regular contributor
for 30 years, and has written short-stories
and articles for nearly every paper and
magazine in Australia. He first learned of
the bush and its ways from his father,
George Lindsay, and his uncle, David
Lindsay; to this he added “all I could
ever learn from personal observation and
experiments plus what bushmen and
aborigines from Cape York to Albany
could teach me.” The results will soon
appeal - in his Bushman’s Handbook,
which Angus and Robertson are publish-
ing. Lindsay gives his hobbies as bush-
walking—he is president of Adelaide
Bushwalkers —and archery,
Herbert Hudd, dead in Adelaide at 67,
was first elected to the S.A. House of
Assembly in 1912. Three years later he
was fighting in France with the 43rd Bat-
talion. He came back with a Military
Cross and again entered Parliament in
1920, and, except for the three years 1938-
41, had been there ever since. He was
Government Whip under Richard Butler
1927-30, and for five years from 1933
held the portfolios of Public Works, Rail-
ways and Marine.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 57, Air-Commodore Wil-
liam James Yule Guilfoyle, 0.8. E., M.C., son
of the Guilfoyle who made the Melbourne
Botanic Gardens into one of the world’s most
beautiful parks. He commanded fighter squad-
rons in World War I and was officer com-
manding the air defences of London when
World War II broke out. He was in Aus-
tralia on a visit when the accidental explosion
of a spirit-lamp killed him.
At Christchurch (M.L.), at 82, James Reid,
a Scot who arrived in M.L. in 1883, took up
Riversdale, Canterbury, and established one of
the first Corriedale flocks in the Dominion.
Recently he sold a Corriedale ram to a South
American breeder for the record M.L. price
of 2000 guineas. He also supplied South Africa
and Australia with first-class English Leicesters.
In Melbourne, at 73, Reginald Frank, Sholl, v
veteran journalist and Law Court identity in
Melbourne. Born in Adelaide, he began his
60-year sojourn on the Inky Way with the
“Register” and later joined S.A. Hansard. He
was on the Federal Hansard staff for 17 years
and was deputy-chief of the Commonwealth
Reporting Branch. Sons are R. R. Sholl, K.C.,
and E. K. Sholl, Queensland manager of A.B.C.
In London, at 90, Sir Alexander Mackintosh,
Parliamentary correspondent who was a mem-
ber of the press gallery at the House of Com-
mons for 57 years and wrote several books on
English political life. He married Miss. Anne
Bannerman, daughter of Andrew Bannerman,
a well-known Bendigo businessman of other
days.
In Melbourne, at 76, Lewis Findlay East,
1.5.0., a former secretary of the Commonwealth
Marine Branch. He helped in the drafting of
the Commonwealth Navy Act and the estab-
lishment of the Repatriation Commission. He
was adviser to the Commonwealth Shipping
Control Board in the last war. L. R. EaSt,
chairman of the State Rivers and Water-supply
CopiTnission, is a son.
In Brisbane, at 61, Henry Alcock, Professor
of History and Dean of the Faculty of Com-
merce at the University of Queensland. An
Englishman, graduate of Magdalen College,
Oxford, he came to Brisbane in 1913 as lecturer
in economics and history, and when the Com-
merce faculty was created in 1923 he became
its first Dean. He was president of the Histori-
cal Society and of the Oxley Memorial Library.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“M. 8”: A sidelight on the long Sydney
beer strike occurred at a pub about 100
miles out of the city, where a party of
golfers spent the week-end. There, in
the dark of the night, with watchers to
see that no jealous eyes could behold the
phenomenon, the publican Fas smuggled
secretly into a bedroom and given a glass
of beer from one of the few bottles the
party had somehow managed to bring
with them. He withstood the shock,
smiled slowly and secretively, and was
led silently back to his drought-stricken
bar.

“Uco”; Speeches at the London
ceremonies in connection with the unveil-
ing of the Roosevelt Memorial in Gros-
yenor-square were an illustration of the
joint heritage the English - speaking
nations possess in the literature of their
common tongue, American Ambassador
Lewis Douglas quoted a phrase which
Shakspeare wrote before the Pilgrim
Fathers landed in America and a line
from “Intimations of Immortality,” writ-
ten by Wordsworth half'a century after
the Declaration of Independence.
Churchill, who often displays a surpris-
ingly wide knowledge of the minor poets,
weighed-in with a verse by an English-
man who spent all his adult life in Aus-
tralia :
We tarry yet, we are toiling still,
He is gone and he fares the best,
He fought Against odds, he struggled up hill,
He has fairly earned his season of rest.
The stanza is from Adam Lindsay Gor-
don’s “Gone,” suggested by the Burke
and Wills monument in Melbourne, and
its selection by Churchill is a reminder
that Gordon has long been more esteemed
in Britain than in this part of the world.
For this the poess shade has probably to
thank Douglas Sladen, who, visiting Aus-
tralia in the 1880’s, never lost his early
admiration for Gordon, and was respons-
ible for having his bust placed in Poets’
Conifer in Westminster Abbey.

“Ray Whiting”: Speaking of Royal
tours, the manager of the Hotel Orange
at Sourabaya was woebegone one day
in ’29. The advance-guard of the King
and Queen of Si'am had arrived to see
that all was as it should be for the Royal
visit, and the manager’s collar was sod-
den with heat and apprehension. “I tell
you, my friend, it is a worry, a great
worry ; the wooden seats are not fitted
to our water-closets, but just the smooth,
round china —for the coolness, you under-
stand?” I understood. “But these people,
they say the Queen may catch the chill.
They insist on the seat of wood. Whether
we can have them fitted in time I know
not—ach! The worry!” The local
plumber must have got a move on, for
on the several occasions that I saw her
Majesty she had no sign of a sniffle.
* * * *
“M.’s Boy”: Touching on this ques-
tion whether neuroses have increased (B.
28/4/’4B), I must say that I’ve been con-
templating going out and having an
accident somewhere. Ever since some-
body or other convinced an American
Court that he or she became a “changed
person” after an accident and the Court
awarded a few thousand dollars com-
pensation there has been a growing
number of similar cases. In one instance
the married partner, who was nowhere
near the accident, also succeeded in gain-
ing compensation for the loss of wh«
may be termed the affected pferty’s
former or pre-accident personality.
Which prompted an embittered friend to
say that he’d willingly foot the bill if
anyone could change his missus’s nature,
by accident or otherwise.
* * * *
“K. Ley”: It’s a long time ago, but talk
of house-names (B. 28/4/’4B) reminds
me that when we were looking over a
vacant dwelling with a view to renting it
we found pinned to the living-room
mantelpiece a note which, in a neat
feminine hand, read;
To the new tenants: We hope you’ll be
as happy in this little house as we have
been. Our first two children were born
here, we saved our first £lOO here and we
made this garden. We leave our lovely
little house because we are going to another
town, and we won’t forget it.—The previ-
ous tenants. 9
The house was one of a row of similar
houses in a drab suburban street, but it
seemed to glow from within. We took it.
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: Public opinion, is it?
You can’t expect sense from politicians.
One .would think that a sensible Govern-
ment which wanted to win its referendum
“I've just bought her!”
would have printed the Opposition’s case
first, declaring it to be a gentle courtesy
to do so, and its own last. When I
opened my copy of the pre-referendum
pamphlet 1 naturally started from the be-
ginning. By the time I had finished the
Government’s case I was firmly convinced
that Chjfley was right and I ought to
vote Yes. Then I read the Opposition’s
statement and it was equally convincing.
So I have made a firm resolution not to
read any more of the propaganda—l am
a No-ite, Had the order been reversed,
Chifley might have had another sup-
porter.

“Becks”: Don’t talk to me about shop-
window “blanks” (B. 28/4/’4B). Baching
once, I went into a shop on the way home
to pick up something for a quick even-
ing meal, bought a couple of meat-pies
and asked for a packet of potato-crisps,
“Sorry, we’re out of ttfem,” said the girl.
She looked doubtful when I told her
there were some in the window, but
checked up and handed me a packet.
When I got home I put them in the
oven with the pies to warm up, then sat
down to my meal. Being alone, I had
no inhibitions about spitting out the first
mouthful I tried. There was no need to
take a second. I had talked the girl into
selling me a dummy packet, and the
white-ant is the only creature I know of
that is capable of digesting wood-
shavings.
* * * *
“Plop”; It seemed a battle was im-
minent. Three'y&mgsters slid in the dim
light over the roof of a garage, and from
Ins commanding tones I gathered that the
one gripping a pen-knife in his teeth was
the general. His soldiers were both
equipped with sticks —oddly similar, since
one waddy was a “Bren” and the other a
“six-shooter.” As I passed underneath
the three blobs I caught a further whis-
per : “Now you sneak round behind Dob-
son’s store and surprise ’em from the
rear. You, you pretend you’re goin’
home. Walk down the street and hide
yusself at the corner. Then I’ll show
meself and draw ’ em while you two come
in on ’em.” Here was a rare general,
perpetrator of a most cunning battle plan,
right up at the front, courageous. As I
entered my gate I paused to watch the
balloon go up. “Br-r-rtts” were com-
ing thick from both sides when mighty
Bunnerong, showing the efficiency of
Sydney’s electricity supply, doused the
suburb’s lights for the fifth successive
rfight. A message came loud and clear
from the general’s mother: “Alfie. Come
home at once. We want some candles.”
He put up a brave show and kept the
battle raging until G.H.Q.’s curt amend-
ment five minutes later; “Alfie. I said
at once !” And then my general deserted.
As he and his lieutenant passed me they
spoke on the powerhouse in a beautiful
soldiering vocabulary that should take
them fan
* * * *
“Clooter”: I have lost a friend and my
country a decided asset, and Socialism
is the thief. He is an educated young
man with a young family, a successful
wheat- and wool-grower who, when the
wars ended, joined with two more young
men in a business venture to provide the
back areas of the country with a flying-
taxi service. It Ipoked like growing into
a big thing; then along came a Socialist
tax which put them out of business. His
partners accepted the inevitable and got
themselves flying jobs in a Government
show ; he is heading with his family to
another British country where Socialism
is not and where initiative, courage and
enterprise are Welcomed by a free and
appreciative community. Wandering
dolefully home after saying farewell, I
couldn’t but wonder what Socialism
offered in his place. I found out. My
bus didn’t arrive, and I asked a Govern-
ment transport official on duty at the
spot if he knew (a) the reason, or ( b )
whether one would come in its place.
He fiercely announced that nobody was
going “to pick on” him and if I wanted
fight I could have it. They’re great fel-
lows for fight, these Government ser-
vants.

“Macnell”; Tell “X.N.0.” piping is
the Navy’s highest compliment, and, as
such, is reserved for officers
mand of seagoing units—another cen-
turies-old method, of impressing on all
hands the importance of and respect due
to commands. A bugle calling the upper-
deck to attention might be sounded for
ex-canecutter Riordan, but sailors know
that a pipe means somebody high in the
naval hierarchy. The King, as Admiral
of the Fleet, is piped ; President Truman
bugled. As for the compliment of “dress-
ing ship being paid to no other than
Royalty,” my ship was dressed for the
Newcastle sesquicentenary, and all ships
are dressed for a fleet regatta.

“Cauboy”; The Olivier revival of “The
School for Scandal” in Melbourne —
A. H. Rogers and Mrs. Charles Poole
gave the first performance of the piece
at the opening of the old Theatre Royal
on July 6, 1850, and there have been
dozens since—produced a surprising re-
suit. It brought to light a descendant of
Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who indig-
nantly protested in a daily to a critic’s
somewhat disparaging remarks about
that playwright. There was a similar
occurrence when “The Barretts of Wim-
pole Street” was produced' in Sydney.
Members of the Barrett family objected
to the portrait presented of their mid-
Victorian grandsire, and there was even
talk of an injunction to ban the per-
formance.
* * * *
“Shavia”: Some more ha’pennies for
“X.S.” (B. 14/4/’4B). Half a dozen
smart young lads sitting opposite in a
“trots”-bound tram the other night
thought they had off the conduc-
tor when they shoved a fistful of pennies
at him for their fares. Noticing their
grins, the connie said “Don’t worry about
the co'ppers, I like ’em. take all you
can get.” While he was down the other
end of the tram the lads got busy and
raked up another dozen. “Here, mate,
here’s another bob’s-worth,” said their
spokesman. “Thanks,” said the connie,
as he accepted the coins and handed over
24 ha’pennies.
**. * *
“Mr.”: Most of those brick terraces
mentioned by “Millswyn” (B. 21/4/’4B)
were built in the boom period of last
century, and I’ll wager the designs and
much of the material were importations
of spec, builders who, having made many
U.K. cities unsightly, succeeded in dis-
figuring large areas overseas. In addi-
tion to Manchester, Birmingham, Lon-
don, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast,
you’ll find the familiar stone boxes with
their depressing balconies, iron frieze-
work and 12-by-two front “gardens” in
places as widely separated as Canada,
Hong Kong, Australia and New Zea-
land. A former Melbourne Health
Officer, Dr. John Dale, once described
these excrescences as airless dismal brick
tunnels. Having spent six rngnths in one
of them I can think of no better descrip-
tion.
* * * *
“Derwent”; Nelson’s voyage home in
a cask of brandy (B. 14/4/’4B) recalls the
custom of “tapping the admiral,” in prac-
tice both in naval and mercantile ships
when there was opportunity, and worked
by means of a straw or other suit-
able aid through which the liquor was
sucked from the cask. The story goes
that when the ca*sk was opened after Nel-
son’s arrival {he admiral was found “high
and dry.” The old East India ships offered
excellent chance for “tapping the ad-
miral” ; each Indiaman generally > called
at Madeira on the outwafd voyage from
England to take on pipes of wine, which
were carried out and back for the pur-
pose of maturing. Crafty seafarers bored
a hole in a pipe, inserted a goose-quill
and sucked out the contents. Many a
pipe of good Madeira failed to make the
trip home.
jjC jJ*
“Ceg”: The spinster lady (B. 21/4/’4B)
who was troubled by a neighbor’s tree
impoverishing her garden could have
adopted a much simpler method of rid-
ding herself of the nuisance. A man I
knew was similarly bothered some years
ago by a large poplar-tree growing right
alongside the fence in the next-door pro-
perty. His lawns and flower-beds were
suffering. He dug a hole, located a good-
sized root and placed the end of it in a
glass-jar containing some sort of acid.
Neatly covering everything up again he
awaited the outcome of his experiment.
The result was slow but sure. The tree
began to look sick, wilted and eventually
died. Yet harmony and goodwill reigned
between the parties. In fact, when bor-
rowing or lending garden tools they often
had long discussions as to .what possibly
could be the matter with the tree.

“N.D.”: In Alexandria Harbor the
Egyptian authorities had constructed a
barbed-wire barricade around “44
Wharf,” the few small openings being
guarded by a swarthy befezzed soldier
ofs that nation. Returning to ship one
night we lost our way. Cock, being a
rare mortal gifted with that quality of
leadership inspired in times of great stress,
took command. We trailed after him.
Suddenly there was a yell and a curse, and
our redoubtable leader was suspended in
mid-air. “Your freendj him caught,” ex-
claimed the startled Gyppo sentry.
“You’re telling me!” yelled Cock,
struggling weakly like a fly in a web.
After much difficulty we extracted him
from the barbed-wire. Half an hour
later, standing on the quarterdeck with
shredded trousers flapping round his
knees. Cock demanded to see the officer-
of-the-day, and the sleepy but angry
face of the officer appeared above
the hatch-combing. “Sir,” uttered
Cock, with the hauteur of an envoy extra-
ordinary. “I wish to state a complaint
and demand reparations from the
Egyptian Government! ” The officer’s face
changed from annoyance to indulgent
pity. Cock, perceiving this, drew himself
up with as much dignity as his unsteady
pins would allow, “You see, sir,” he
said with a sweep of the arm. “I have
injured my face, my suit and my per-
son! I demand at least the price of a
new suit.” Twelve months later I met
Cock in Sydney. “Did the Egyptian
Government meet their obligations?” I
asked. “A man wouldn’t get a blasted
onion-bag out of those lousy blighters,”
was the emphatic reply.
THE RULING PASSION.
“In the closing stages of the recent elections
Italians rushed from the polls to buy tickets in a
nation-wide pool on how many seats each party
would get in the new Assembly.’’
A very human touch as a preamble
To learning who had won the fateful day,
Lending an added interest to the scramble
For votes in the political affray;
And, seeing most of us are bound to gamble
And speculate on something anyway,
Why not upon our party hopes and pals
As well as on the speed of animals?
Betting’s forbidden here about elections,
Banned by some antiquated law, you’ll note.
No know-all tipsters give us sage reflections
Re who, on form, is like to top the vote;
No s.{s. bookies wait for the directions
Of punters, and there isn’t even a tote
Whereto an enterprising chap might dash
To supplement his judgment with his cash.
Queer we should bet upon the legs of horses
And hounds, and irresponsive things like that,
In preference to the intellectual forces
Lying beneath a politician’s hat,
And just how far his plausible discourses
Will serve him with the proletariat,
Matters to which the dullest mind should turn
As being of more practical concern.
In Italy they’ve sounder games than races
Between dumb brutes whereon to splash their
dough.
Brisk is the betting on the wins and places
The final verdict of the polls may show
For brains and eloquence and platform graces.
And, when they’ve done their duty, off they
. SO,
As eagerly as kids released from school,
To queue for tickets in a monster poof,
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“Bo”: Viewing humanity in the social
mass is always a fascinating pastime,
and never more so than when men,
elbow-steering their wives through a
crush of immobile chatterers, come on
the inevitable fashion freak. When one
of their own sex is got up like nothing
on earth, escorted women manage in pass-
ing to t&ke in, in one impersonal eye-
sweep, every detail of the ensemble.. Their
menfolk invariably fail to dissemble their
admiration, horror or amusement,
according to taste. So it came somewhat
as a surprise when a befurred dowager,
passing through the crowded foyer of
Sydney’s Town Hall on a celebrity con-
cert night, stopped dead in her tracks
under the big crystal chandelier at sight
of the apparition: platform-soled shoes
with prominent ankle-straps, full bal-
lerina skirt and waist as “nipped-in” as
outraged nature could take it, all in
shocking polychromatics, and * with a
double-bun of hair which had been left
far too long in the blue rinse. But the
wearer of the latest in flapper clothes
was, by the clock, certainly not a day
under 55. The dowager’s mouth opened,
then she whispered to her elderly hus-
band “That’s the ‘new look,’ Herbert.”
Herbert unleashed a quizzical grin, then
stage-whispered back in a voice that
could be heard out on the steps: “Well,
she’s got an old look to go with it,
m’ dear!”

“Laetitia”; Postponement of an exe-
cution because the condemned “could not
be hanged withput suffering extreme
physical agony” (B. 14/4/’4B) recalls the
chivalrous remark credited to my own
Hibernian- great-grandsire as, with level
muzzle-loaders, he and a friend lay under
& hedge awaiting the arrival of a Sassen-
ach landlord. With the lack of con-
sideration for others so characteristic of
his class, the object of their vigil failed
“Say when you re tired, Bill, and we'll sit one out."
to*put in an appearance, thus prolonging
their wait, which was rendered no more
pleasant by a biting wind, a chill drizzle
and the wail of a banshee from the copse
behind Tim Murphy’s cottage. My
granddaddy felt so uneasy as to remark
“Shure! An’ he is late. I Hope nothing’s
happened to the poor gintleman.” Inci-
dentally, it was the landlord’s tardiness
that for great-granddaddy’s
coining out to Australia as a displaced
person. He’d been sucking so long at
his flask of potheen that his aim was im-
paired and his target lived to testify
against him. Curse the drink!
* * * *
“Wusslean”: Receiving a cheque the
other day from the local council I was
surprised to find that the attached receipt
required not only my own signature but
also that of a witness. My first thought,
as a freedom-loving citizen, was to write
to the town clerk, asking by what right
the council demanded a receipt in a form
other than that laid down in the Instru-
ments Act, but with one eye on the
cheque I tore up the attempt at sarcasm
and meekly handed the offending receipt
to my wife for signature. Thus, irt this
bureaucrat-ridden country does the habit
of form-filling make cowards of us all.
Incidentally, the cheque ijself bore four
signatures—those of three councillors
and the town clerk.

“Curtain Raiser”: Olivier queues con-
tinue to clutter up Melbourne footpaths
near the booking-office; public ridicule
has not deterred the squatters. A broad-
casting-station sent a man to inter-
view the members. With his mouth
to the mike he bent over a bundle huddled
on the pavement dreaming that Sir Lau-
rence was offering her a cup of steaming
cocoa. “And here we have a little girl
in her sleeping-bag,” he burbled. “This
devoted student of the drama has her
even more 7 devoted dog lying alongside
her to guard her. Let us hear what she
has to say,” “Get to hell out of this,”
yelled the damsel, sitting upright and
aiming a furious blow at the stray canine
that had taken up sleeping-quarters along-
side her.

“Suvic”; It’s a fact! A Yarrasider
in Queensland recently suffered mos-
quitoes for three nights before complain-
ing that her net lacked a back. She’d
been tucking the doubled net under the
foot of the mattress, making a kind of
hood over her.

“Myrrhee”: Just after reading that
par. on Yeats’s penchant for reading his
own poetry aloud (B. 21/4/’4B), I came
across this comment by Somerset Maug-
ham in a foreword to some of the Irish
poet’s verses: “Though at times he could
be very good company, he was a pomp-
ous, vain man; to hear him read his
own verses was as excruciating an ordeal
as anyone could be exposed to; he
adopted the poses of a great poet as
blatantly as a ham actor adopts the poses
of a great tragedian; and the disconcert-
ing thing was that he was a great poet.”
* * * *
“Sach”: For ten minutes the street-
photographer had been trying to get the
small girl to smile. Finally he did a little
jig, but she still regarded him soberly
until he got near the edge of the foot-
path, tripped and fell flat on his back in
the gutter. The little girl nearly laughed
her head off. “Quick,” said the mother,
“she’s smiling now.” The photographer,
brushing himself down, did not appear
to be amused.
* * * *
“Bosun’s Mate”: I have the story of
cruiser Liverpool’s torpedoing (B.
28/4/’4B) strikingly told in a series of
photographs taken by a gunner’s mate
from her fore-control immediately after
she was hit. Punching into her just abaft
A turret, the torpedo wrenched her side
plates off. The starb’d cable-holder was
blown skyward and the port holder thrust
six feet from the deck. Striking upward,
the blast lifted A turret’s top neatly off
a nd reduced the gun-house to twisted
metal, with two of the three barrels
crossed like a pair of scissors. Then the
whole foc’s’le, over 1000 tons of it,
started to twist to starb’d. Under its own
weight and tons of water inside, nearly
a fifth of the ship’s length sheared off,
hung poised a moment with its stem and
anchors pointed at the sky, then dropped
under the sea. Perhaps the most felling
aspect the pictures portrayed was the
nonchalance of bridge personnel watching
her break. Two were leaning their elbows
on the wind-break in the attitude of har-
bor-trippers on a Manly ferry; a gunner
“Your wife Wants this to remember you by"
was pointing something out in his smashed
turret, and another, probably a ship-
wright, was gazing ruefully at B deck’s
splintered planking. And all this on a
bowless ship with the Crete-evacuation
battle at its fiercest.

“Jasby”: Publication in Perth of a list
of unclaimed prizes in the W.A. State
Lottery, including one of £5OO won by a
ticket taken out in the name “This Time,
Perth,” brought hundreds of applications
from hopeful souls who thought, or pro-
fessed to think, they were rightly entitled
to the prize. Those unclaimed prize-lists
can be responsible for some strange hap-
penings. Many years ago I received a
list from Hobart and noticed on it the
name of an. acquaintance who had won
£lOO a couple of years previously. Think-
ing to do my Boy Scout act, I rang him
up. Was he pleased? He was not. “Pity
you people can’t mind your own busi-
ness,” he told me. “My phone’s hardly
stopped ringing all this week. Of course
I know I won the prize. Knew it two
years ago. When I want it I’ll collect it.
You look after your business ; I’ll look
after mine.” He rang off, beating me to
it by half a second.

“R.W.”: On a country trip for the
firm, I spent the Week-end with an old
school-friend, the rector of a scattered
country parish. After doing the rounds
on Sunday we finished up at the parish
church for the evening service, and, when
that was over, slipped over to the
“local,” where the proprietor let us in by
the side door and shut us in the parlor.
This appeared to be a long-established
custom; it fell to me to go into the bar
for the drinks, as the padre was a trifle
concerned lest some of his flock should
see him there. I was a little surprised
’ when I saw through a half-open door the
two gents who had taken up the plate
sinking a few beers. With them were a
number of others in Sunday best. Ap-
parently half the male congregation had
dropped in before going home and had
left their wives gossiping outside the
church.

“Murlonger” on a vanished Force:
This year marks the centenary of the Queens-
land Native Mounted Police, formed in 1848
before the State was even a colony. The
squatters of the Condamine and Burnett formed
it as a freelance corps to protect their lives,
flocks and herds. They imported Frederick
Walker, known as “Filibuster,” to handle the
native police. After the Filibuster had done
a good job, with Lieut. Marshall as his second-
in-charge, the squatters reckoned the blacks had
been taught a summary lesson. They disbanded
the corps and sacked the Filibuster. "The blacks
played merry hell. Filibuster came back in ’57
and stayed on the job till ’6O, when he went
looking for Burke and Wills. Murray then
took charge. After him Seymour was the big
boss, to be succeeded by Parry-Okeden till the
corps went out of existence about 1900. The
old N.M.P. might have carried things with a
high hand and a ready trigger-finger—many
old maids of both sexes would condemn their
actions —but those old-time officers held their
lives in their hands, risked death a hundred
times, rubbed shoulders with sickness all the
time, and did more to open up the country
and make it safe than all the spoutings of
politicians put together. One hundred years
old! I was associated with them, lived with
them for years, was present at their death, and
I’m proud to say I was one of them.

“Jemac”: Not only boxing-rings (B.
28/4/’4B) but pets are reappearing on
the decks of H.M. ships. One of the
best known is Oswald the Owl, ward-
room habitue of Fleet Air Arm training-
ship Goshawk in Trinidad. Distinguished
by a head as bald as your thumb, Oswald
always enters the mess the same way—
through the door at full throttle,. sharp
bank round the fan, an axial roll with a
roll off the top, nose-down into a dive
and side-slip neatly on to the wardroom
bar. Here, half-glasses of beer, mostly
fiat, ensure that Oswald seldom leaves the
mess with the same aeronautical savoir
faire which distinguishes his entrance. A
complaint in the Mess Suggestion Book
reads: “Suggest Air Ministry be con-
tacted regarding single-engined aircraft
which continually jettisons its bombs in a
thickly-populated area.”

“Scotia”: The impressive solemnity of
sermon-time was rudely shattered by a
budding Einstein of about eight years
who, despite the frantic bidding of well-
ordered and pious parents, and the bale-
ful looks of all manner of , females,
fairly itched to spill the beans. The
devout “Ssti’d, ssh’d” in sotto voce,
but the little mathematician shook and
bubbled and positively gurgled with
mirth. Then he laughed outright, loudly
enough to disturb the orating canon, who
paused and looked round aggrievedly.
then it came: “But can’t you see? It’s
the first time it’s ever happened here.
Look at the hymns numbered on the
board. They are 18, 237, .92, and the last
one is 347. It’s a miracle, that’s what.
They’ve added them up right for once.”

“L.A.M.”: I can’t let “Bohemian” (B.
17/3/’4B) get away with the claim that
Brunner was the first to discover coal in
Maoriland. That honor rightly belongs
to my grandfather, Captain Frederick
Moore, who, in the brigantine Jewess,
sailed down the west coast in 1840 and
discovered what is now West Wanganui.
His narrative of the trip records the find-
ing of “a outcrop of good, hard
coal.” The seam was about five feet
thick, and “with a few rough-made crow-
bars we succeeded in pinching out 50
tons of coal blocks.” His discovery pre-
dated Brunner’s by eight years.
• * * »
“Ceg” in reminiscent mood;
Dear to me is the memory of touring shows
of a generation ago and those “families” of
entertainers such as the Corricks, the Lynch
Bellringers, the Hector Lightfoots and others.
I remember Dan Barry and his players in “Hans
the Boatmaii” and “While London Sleeps,” Dan
always arriving in the nick of time to
save the heroine, with revolver Mazing and
the hall, when the curtain went down, filled
with smoke. Cole’s Bohemians always travelled
in horse-drawn caravans, Captain Cole looking
like Buffalo Bill and the “star” Vene Linden
with a magnificent caravan all to herself. One
of their great attractions was “Dick Turpin’s
Ride to York.” They played in a large tent
and I can see Black Bess now, standing in
the wings ready to dash on, whilst soapy lather
was splashed on her flanks. Then a good kick
in the tail and on she bounded with Dick in the
saddle. I recall a company playing “East Lynne.”
They stayed at the Coffee Palace and Sir Archi-
bald Carlyle and Madame Vine, as husband
and wife, shared a bedroom with their daughter,
who played Little Willie. The house had been
poor and Dad and Mura, who had been trying
to drown their sorrows with stout, fought like
cat and dog. The walls of the Coffee Palace
were thin and I could hear it all, with poor
Little Willie weeping much more realistically
than she wept on the stage. They were
stranded—no money for train fares to get on
to the next town. Who ever heard of a talkie
being stranded? It was flesh-and-blood stuff
all right: on the stage and off. With those
old companies the head man always came in
front of the curtain at the end of the perform-
ance, thanked the patrons for their kind attend-
ance and announced that the company would
be round again next year with the “best of the
new plays from London.” I always felt that
it was the patrons who should have done the
thanking.

“Melbn”: Melburnians interested in
horses need go no further than the back-
yards of Fitzroy. The cultivation of the
horse is the art of that salubrious suburb,
and more first-rate neddies are to be
found there than in 50 miles of the
country. Their owners live for their
horses, spend their leisure grooming
them and polishing up their harness,
enter them in gymkhanas and get their
chief aesthetic pleasure out of the occupa-
tion. Being the owner of a piece of
horseflesh worth possibly £5OO is as much
a tradition in Fitzroy as owning an
alleged Old Master is in Toorak, and it
would be an interesting subject for a
historian to trace the tradition back to
the days of Batman, when the suburb
was grazing-paddocks.
A CONSTITUTIONAL
ANACHRONISM.
“Criticising the Government’s proposal to increase
the size of the Federal Parliament, Mr. Lang pointed
out that the Labor platform provided for the abo-
lition of the Senate, which had become a constitu-
tional anachronism.” .
In theory, you’ll note, they’d like to ring
The knell of Senators, as futile men.
In practice it’s a very different thing,
For every six we have they’d give us ten.
For years it’s been the Labor policy
To toss the Senate into the abysm,
Now the same crowd are out to profit by
A constitutional anachronism.
Most Upper Houses, if they’re worth their salt,
Provide a barrier and a check, no less,
To hasty legislation, call a halt
To Bursts of popular impulsiveness.
But when you realise that all their task
Is but to act as echoes and as prisms
To Lower Houses, aren’t they, you may ask,
Mere constitutional anachronisms?
Ours sit in solemn conclave now and then,
The business that’s done being mostly nix;
And what employment can there be for ten
When vainly looking for it taxes six?
Still, at the present Parliamentary rates,
Few will discount the project’s magnetism;
It should produce whole rafts of candidates,
Our constitutional anachronism.
A good mouth-filling phrase we’ve here, one
feels,
Such as attention readily compels,
Coming from Mr. Lang, who seldom deals
In these tongue-twisting polysyllables.
And what a test for any one suspect
(And combating the charge) of alcoholism
To hear some stern-faced station cop direct
“Say ‘Constitutional Anachronism’! ”

To celebrate the sixtieth year of the
business a p.c. bonus was added to
the 7 p.c. ord. div., making 9j p.c, for
the year, which was a comfortable
matter. Largest and most successful thing
of its kind, the organisation was built
up by the Wunderlich family; since the
present co. took over in 1908 it has
never failed to pay a div., and a generous
staff-partner * scheme has contributed to
loyalty and co-operation among the staff.
The three Wunderlich brothers,
Ernest, Alfred and Otto, were born in
London and set out in life with dis-
tinctly different aims, but came together
in Australia. Ernest, whose hobbies were
astronomy and music, arrived in Sydney
in 1885 with some European manufactur-
ing agencies; he founded the business
and was chairman until his death in 1945.
Alfred, the present* chairman, who has
also done much for music, joined his
brother in 1886. Otto, a doctor with a
leaning to literature, served as an M.O. in
the Boer War, came to Australia on a
visit to his brothers in 1900, and decided
to throw in his lot with them. He retired
from the board last year.
Turnover is governed by conditions in
the building and construction trades, etc.
Of the co.’s 16 factories —five in N.S.W.,
four in Vic., two in S. Aus., three in
Queensland and two in Tas. —five turn
out architectural and industrial metal-
work, five terra-cotta roofing tiles, three
asbestos-cement products, two architec-
tural terra-cotta facings and one stone-
ware.
During the war plant was kept busy
fabricating metal components, etc., for
defence purposes. And net earnings
averaged £58,983 for the five years to
close of accounts in 1945, compared with
an average of £55,900 for the preceding
quinquennium. For the last three years
there has been a steadily swelling volume
of normal production as activity in the
building and ancillary trades gathered
momentum. The number of private-
building permits issued in metropolitan
areas throughout the Commonwealth
has been as follows;

In addition. State Governments have
launched out on expensive private home-
building programmes ; but generally pro-
gress has been retarded by an uneven
flow of materials to the building scene,
owing to strikes, industrial hold-ups and
go-slow tactics, which have further
bumped-up costs.
Turnover advanced in all States last
term, the improvement being most
marked in Victoria, where duplication of
the tile-works is well advanced ; a new
tile factory at Launceston (Tas.) is also
practically complete. Chief bottlenecks
have been shortage of labor and materials,
mainly asbestos and sheet steel. Last
year’s net result covered the full contract
rates to the prefs. and 17.6 p.c, on the
£440,400 of ord. capital as against 11.9,

The history of this co.—it-was formed
in 1915 to take over some of the pro-
perties that fell into the hands of the
Queensland National Bank after the crash
of the early 1890’s—is redolent of the out-
back run-owner’s struggle with nature
and markets. The co.’s big leasehold
properties are in the far-west of Queens-
land and over the border in the Territory.
It also owns three coastal freeholds, aggre-
gating approximately 46,000 acres, in the
Gladstone, Nanango and Kingaroy dis-
tricts. Heavy losses were incurred during
the between-wars period, owing to
drought, rising costs and vanishing
markets. The influence of Vesteys in
Britain and of the Meat Trust in America
guaranteed the inside running to the
Argentine; and, when the hot sun dried
up the western watercourses and left the
runs bare of feed, mortality of livestock,
and cost of handfeeding and agistment,
bit deeply into savings and capital and
sent the co. into debt as well. To wipe
out accumulated losses £525,000 (17s. 6d.
per share) of ord. capital was jettisoned
in 1932. Six years later the prefs. agreed,
to forgo £192,500 of accumulated divs.
and to reduce the rate from 7 p.c. to
6 p.c.
Meanwhile, nature smiled at intervals,
and has kept on doing so. With*
World War II came the stabilising influ-
ence of the wool and meat contracts,
which meant ready markets at good prices
and a satisfactory run of earnings. For the
last couple of years fair to favorable
seasonal conditions, together with high
prices for wool and livestock and con-
tinuance of the British meat contract,
have enabled the co. to show the, best
results since 1920.
Last year started with the runs dry,
but good rains in August and September
ensured no more than normal losses of
livestock. Increases in calves and lambs
were fair, and there was a keen demand
for cattle and sheep. Wool (greasy) aver-
aged £45 19s. 6d. a bale for the six months
to December last, compared with an
average of £3O 19s. 6d. for the preceding
12 months and £2O 3s. 9d. for the year
before that. After providing something
for taxation and setting aside £17,869
(down £1109) for depreciation—included
with profit in the table and then shown as
written olf—the net amount available for
distribution Was £2692 better at £36,296.
That covered pref. requirements and
28.3 p.c. on the £75,000 of ord. capital
as against 24.8, 22.4, 31.6, 11.3, 7.9 and
17.6 p.c. back to 1941. The div., sixth
thing of its kind since 1920, was kept
at 6 p.c. The £16,796 that was left lifted
reserves to £40,131 —11 years ago there
was a deficit on capital account of
£70,077. It has been a creditable perform-
ance.
Finances improved, and are now in
better trim than they have been for many
years:—

, Act from 1/10/’SI.
Last year’s profit (up £11,262) was the
best since the .business was set on its feet
26 years ago. The co. is one of Australia's
leading producers of lingerie, hosiery and
men’s-wear, which it turns out from a
big and efficient plant at Boundary-street,
Sydney, and from a branch factory at
Newcastle, set up in 1941 to help over-
come labor difficulties. And there are
two subsidiaries, Lustre (N.Z.), Ltd., and
Silktex Pty,, which continue to give a
good account of themselves. A third,
Sphinx Engineering Pty., bought for “a
specific purpose during the war,” was
sold last term without loss—shrinkage
in the parent’s shareholdings (in at cost)
Was £BOOO.
Like others in the trade, the co.’s acti-
vities have been hindered by shortages
of raw materials and labor in the metro-
politan area and by delays in delivery of
new plant. It is plain from the figures,
however, that the management allowed
no grass to grow under its feet during
the switch from standardised defence pro-
ducts to the miscellaneous demands of the
civilian market for style and quality,
though both are still below pre-war range.
And a ready market awaited last year’s
increased output of coupon-free products.
Demand for full-fashioned silk hosiery
ran well ahead of production. The co.’s
new nylon hosiery didn’t come on to the
market until February last, owing to
paucity in the supply of yarn; technical
difficulties had been overcome early in the
piece.
The leap in the year’s gross earnings
(£174,256) was £46,549. Including pro-
vision for taxation (£45,500, up £27,760)
and depreciation (£18,974, down £673),
exe5.'(£133,634) got away with £35,278 of
the gain. The net result (£40,622, up
£11,262) was 13.1 p.c. on the £310,000 of

cumulative 10 p.c.—compared with 9.4,
9.1, 10.1, 10.8, 9.6 and 9 p.c. back to 1941.
It was enough to pay the prefs. their full
contract rate and show 14.2 p.c. on ord.
capital. The div., however, was kept at
an all-round 9 p.c. for the eighth year in
succession—the prefs. are subject to the
outmoded N. S. Wales Interest Reduction
Act of 1931, under which they advance
point for point with the ords. froma mini-
mum 7\ p.c. to their full contract rate.
At the moment the impact of rising
wage, raw-material and other costs is
being absorbed by expanding turnover,
subsidies and adjustments to selling prices,
which are"controlled. What will happen
when production overtakes demand, and
shortages abate and price competition re-
asserts itself, remains to be seen. Buyers
are highly sensitive to price differentia-
tions whenever they have any choice.
Style, finish, quality and the efficiency of
plant will then play a much greater part
in sales than they do today. All that can
be said definitely is that Lustre has always
enjoyed a high reputation in all these
matters, and, to keep abreast of the latest
technical and other developments in the
trade, some of the co’s executives and tech-
nicians recently visited U.S. and Britain,

Twice you have said “No”, and the threats
have not been fulfilled.

Other features of the “post-

last year were the disposal of

Prices Referendum
Price-control, introduced by
the Menzies Government within
a few weeks of the outbreak of
war, was designed as a check to
overcharging and profiteering
during a period in which the
country was engaged on the
production of munitions rather
than consumer goods, and in
which the necessities of civilian
life were bound to be in short
supply. It was realised also that
huge war expenditures would
have the result of enlarging per-
sonal incomes, thus increasing
spending-power in a time when
the supply of civilian goods
would be scarce, with the
obvious result that ’prices and
costs, if left uncontrolled, would
swiftly rise and money and Gov-
ernment stock would lose much
of its buying-power.
There is no question that
price-control during the war-
time emergency was a most
desirable thing. Its objects were
democratic and economic. With
the aid of war-time subsidies it
did do a great deal in keeping
down living costs, though, of
course, it was unable to do any-
thing about checking the growth
in banked-up spending-power
that has for a long period
threatened to force price-rises
at many points, and which has,
in fact, been a great source of
support for the blackmarket.
Even during war-time, how-
ever, price-control, by its very
effectiveness, encouraged the
Labor Governments which suc-
ceeded Mr. Menzies and Mr.
Fadden to expand credit dan-
gerously: to swell Budget ex-
penditure and to overload Gov-
ernment and industrial payrolls.
The effect was something like
accelerating a car with the brakes
on; progress lost its smooth-
ness, and the brakes showed
ominous signs of burning out,
while a great deal of “black”
smoke clouded the proceedings.
Thus, in spite of price-control,
the cost of living has risen,
officially, by over 30 p.c. during
and since the war, and, in order
to cope with higher living costs,
the basic wage has been raised
from 795. a week to around 1 (ss.
The war in Europe has now
been over for nearly three years,
and the Pacific conflict ended
about 33 months ago. But price-
control, designed to cope with
war-time shortage of civil goods
in conjunction with war-time ex-
cess of public spending-power, is
still with us ; and the “Labor”
Government, which in 1944
sought a five-year extension of
Commonwealth powers over
prices, now asks for the right
to control prices for all time.
Without the slightest ques-
tion “Labor” Socialism is the
motive prompting the Canberra
Government to seek this right
to control prices permanently.
It no longer even denies it,
though it never has had many
qualms about calling black white
if it suited the occasion.
With its 1944 referendum re-
quest for extended price-control
“The bottom ones are gone, but you can have the key of
a top flat for a couple of hundred!”
the Government asked for 13
other additional powers. This
was a kind of master-plan of
socialisation; and John Curtin
exclaimed publicly, for some
reason best known to himself,
“This is no longer my referen-
dum ! ” The thing .was decisively
rejected.
Since then the Government
has sought to achieve by finan-
cial and similar methods powers
which it failed to get through
alteration of the Constitution.
To begin with, its budgetary
policy is socialistic. It aims to
draw from the people the maxi-
mum in the way of taxation and
loan revenue and to employ the
maximum number of, civil ser-
vants. By so doing it aims to
take financial strength away
from private industry, add to
its own employment-giving and
industrial power, and at all
times strengthen the nature of
its controls over the manage-
ment and employment sides o*f
industry, reducing all private
initiative.
In 1938-39 all public authori-
ties levied £l4l million in direct
and indirect taxes, the national
income then being estimated at
£BO3 million. In 1946-47 the tax
figure was £433 million, the
national income £1265 million.
The proportion of total personal
incomes absorbed by taxation
has doubled since war began,
and the spending-power left with
the proprietary side of industry
has correspondingly shrunk,
especially when ■ the decline in
the value of money is taken into
account. Wage-earners have
come into a kind of paper-money
prosperity, but rising living costs
have made the whole thing a
mockery in the face of the con-
tinuing production depression.
Tha Government’s aim has
been deliberately socialistic, as
shown by its Bank Grab Act, its
attempt to nationalise the air-
lines, its “social-security” pro-
gramme and so forth. It has
sided with Communist trade-
union policy time and time
again. But its planning has
been added to by incidental cir-
cumstances, chief of which has
been the production depression,
intentionally furthered by the
Communists.
It has been part of Commu-
nist policy to retard production
and distribution, to encourage
demands for the 40-hour week
and higher wages, and to sup-
port the Canberra policy of a
mere payroll form of “full em-
ployment.” The reduced pro-
duction that has resulted from
this policy has been accompanied
by the creation of a great volume
of spending-power, causing an
inflationary condition that
seemingly calls for the continu-
ance of price-controls. This
situation is purposely encouraged
by Communists arid Socialists in
order to pave the way for public
acceptance of centralised autho-
ritarian controls.
As pointed out already, the
Governments of Australia have
had *he best part of three years
of peace in which to restore
production to an adequate level.
The Canberra Crowd’s request
for a continuance of price-
controls is a confession of its
utter failure, “full employment”
notwithstanding, to reorganise
the productive resources of the
country and re-establish full
productive Capacity. It has
played with doctrines and “isms”
during the past three years, just
as it played politics during the
war period. It has failed utterly
to shape up to the problems of
peace-time production just as it
failed to set itself to the task of
making our costly War effort
really effective. Since October,
1941, Australia has been gov-
erned by men of small capacity,
distinguished for their envies,
prejudices and extreme political
ambitions rather than their
abilities, and who have been
vested with enormous war-time
powers, which they have grossly
abused.
“Labor” right through the
piece has sided with the indus-
trial anarchists. There has been
mutual support at all critical
times. And “Labor,” appar-
ently, has not been unaware that
a production depression, con-
tinued as long as possible, was
the very thing to persuade the
people that continued socialistic
controls over our economy were
necessary. It has used a depres-
sion bogy to try to convince the
electors that the nationalisation
of the trading banks was neces-
sary,
“Labor” economic and indus-
trial policy is phony and suspect
from start to finish. Mr. Chifley
and others in his outfit are set
on socialism in Australia. Their
Prices and Charges Referendum
is essentially a move to imple-
ment “Labor” socialism. And
here, as in Europe, the Com-
munists are co-operating with a
very Special interest.
Wrong Tax Assessments
There has been a shoal of
remarkably inaccurate tax assess-
ments issued by the Sydney
office, and one or two elderly
people hsve been almost
rendered prostrate on being
confronted with an apparent tax
liability several times greater
than the amount expected. All
assessments, for this reason,
should be checked, as far as
possible, by the taxpayer before
paying the department.
In one case brought to notice
the taxable income was £321,
and the tax, prior to rebates
(£l6 175.), was £2l 17s. But in
deducting the rebates the depart-
ment made the net amount £65,
instead of £5! Having made
this mistake the subsequent cal-
culations went from bad to
worse, and the provisional tax
for next year, plus social-ser-
vices contribution, sent the total
assessment up to £152, whereas
the true figure should be under
£2O. "
The assessment was initialled
as having been checked by some-
one, but this supervision was
obviously valueless. And yet it
should be clear on the face of
it that it is impossible for a
person to be charged £152 in
tax on a total assessable income
of £321.
Taxpayers, especially those
who are not employees within
a group system, should therefore
take particular notice of their
assessments this year, and draw
departmental attention to any
levy they consider excessive.
Assessments are hard enough to
follow at any time, and over-
charges are highly likely in view
of the assessment quoted, and
others like it.
Maoriland’s Trade
Business groups in New Zea-
land have been getting into holts
with their Government for weeks
past over 1948 import cuts. Im-
porters, retailers and clothing-
makers are all on the warpath
as import quotas are slashed in
M.L.’s bumper export year, and
warn that there will be a day of
reckoning unless officialdom re-
laxes.
Farmers aren’t too happy,
either, because chopping trade
is a game the other fellow can
play, too. Might prove a


THE ESSENTIAL FACTS
about the REFERENDUM
A “NO” VOTE DOES NOT MEAN
THE CESSATION OF SUBSIDIES TO
PRIMARY PRODUCERS. The authority
to pay such subsidies exists under another
Section of the Constitution altogether.
Their continued payment has nothing
whatever to do with the powers now
sought by the Chifley Government.
A “NO” VOTE DOES NOT MEAN THE
CESSATION OF PRICE AND RENT
CONTROLS. All State Governments are
ready and able to do a more effective job
in regard to both than was EVER done
by Socialist Governments in distant Can-
berra.
A “NO” VOTE DOES MEAN a powerful
checkmate to the Chifley Government’s
plan for the complete socialisation of all
industry and business in Australia.

B. I. SLAGWOOL
IN SUMMER, when temperatures soar, you
will doubly appreciate the cool comfort that
8.1. Slagwool brings to your home. Rooms
are 8° to 15° cooler, even on the hottest
days. Bedrooms are no longer like ovens—
you sleep soundly, wake refreshed, feel
better and eat better,
because 8.1. SLAGWOOL keeps the heat OUT.
IN WINTER. you will no longer be spending
considerable amounts in keeping the home
warm, if you insulate with 8.1. Slagwool.
And what a difference 8.1. Slagwool makes
—it holds the heat inside the home—all
rooms are uniformly comfortable —colds are
fewer, and the whole family enjoys better
health,
because 8.1. SLAGWOOL keeps the heat IN.

boomerang for little Maoriland,
one of the world’s greatest
traders. Risky or silly, or both,
is what many in N.Z. think as
they see control-minded Labor-
ites fiddling. Hard-pressed John
Bull might get tough soon, even
with members of the family, if
M.L. doesn’t show more give-
and-take.
President Haskell Anderson,
of N.Z. Associated Chambers of
Commerce, says there’s a nigger
in the woodpile in a move to
pay off another £NZ24 million
of debt to Britain, and wants to
know how Maoriland is going
to get away with this when
Britain desperately needs mar-
kets in order to reach export
targets. This £24 million would
come in handy as orders for
John Bull’s factories, but won’t
help much as money paid back
for old loans.
New Zealand retailers,
human-like, are worried about
stocks. Shelves stacked with
goods from 1947’s,,year-end rush
of imports might be getting
empty-looking betcre 1948 is
out unless there is a strong fol-
low-up in new supplies. Already
retailers scent a threatening
drought and are condemning
year-to-year rationing as too
jerky for trade. Longer plan-
ning, more flexibility and an end
of hand-to-mouth practices are
what they ask, and they’re in
good company when they lash
out at bureaucracy tangled in a
maze of detail. If aggregate im-
port-limits were fixed and
traders left free to do the bal-
ance of the planning things
would be better all round, but
that is an idea that doesn’t seem
to penetrate the minds of Labor
higher-ups. Pooh-bah officials
who have tried to teach mer-
chants and retailers where, how
much and when to buy have
nearly strangled business with
red-tape. Now it’s somebody
else’s turn.
N.Z. manufacturers are the
latest belligerents. A while back
they wouldn’t be seen in the
same camp with importers and
their ilk. President J. J. Dela-
hunt, of the Garment Manufac-
turers’ Federations, has stepped
into the ring and challenged
Acting-Minister of Customs
Nordmeyer over cheeseparing
of imports of raw materials for
clothing factories. He denounces
“shortsighted and restrictive
controls,” and demands a “pro-
gressive, long-range policy*”
coupled with creation of an in-
dependent tariff board.
They’re a motley group, these
rivals, to be lined up for an anti-
Governmetnt offensive, but self-
preservation is a powerful
motive.
Commenting on the fall in
commodity and share prices in
the United States during Febru-
ary, the National City Bank of
New York remarks that it sen-
sationally illustrated the para-
dox that while people want
prices to Come down they are
made uneasy by developments
threatening to depress them.
The fall in food prices, while
desired, alarmed businessmen:
the drop, though it indicated
lower living costs and weakened
the argument of labor unions
for wage-increases, thus offer-
ing hope of a break in the in-
flation spiral, at the same time
raised fears of the possibility of
a slump like that experienced in
1920-21. The N.C.B. was itself
of the opinion that, even though
analysis of the outlook may lead
to- optimistic rather than pessi-
mistic conclusions, “no extended
discussions should be necessary
to show that demands for wage-
increases which the unions are
going ahead with are untimely.”
Wall-street stock prices have
lately been stronger.

Sales of Australian wool for
the nine months to March 31
totalled £103,7 million, com-
pared with £92.4 million during
the whole of the 1946-47 year.
Fpr the corresponding nine
months of 1946-47 the figure
was £6B million. Increase for
the three quarters of 1947-48
represents 52 \ p.c. Turnover
for the latest period was
2,005,457 bales greasy and
115,616 scoured, compared with
2,075,932 bales greasy and
121,758 scoured in the corre-
sponding part of the preceding
year. Greasy averaged 38.2 d.,
against 24.3 d., and scoured
51.5 d., compared with 41d.

Closely following the forma-
tion of Commonwealth Cer-
amics, Ltd., in Sydney, to turn
out glazed wall and floor tiles
has come the registration of a
new A.C.I. subsidiary with the
same object. The supply of
these tiles, which have mainly
been imported from Britain,
shows a slight tendency to im-
prove, but the shortage is still
acute. Local manufacture is
restricted by lack of skilled labor
rather than materials, although
coal hasn’t been plentiful.
Both the new cos. hope to begin
production this year. Com-
monwealth Ceramics still has to
instal plant at its Mascot factory,
which #as previously the cer-
amics division of Ferro Enamels
(Aust.) Pty. L. J. Hartnett,
formerly of General Motors-
Holdens, is to be chairman,
whilst the managing-director is
R. M. Mueller, who plays the
same role for Ferro Enamels.

field. On last balance-sheet

claimed for goodwill. Their
market price was a-bout 265. sd.
until rumors of the proposed

formed in 1937 as a merger of
the 28-year-old Schute Bell Co.,
which had a successful record
as wool- and produce-brokers,
and Keith Badgery and Lumby,
stock and property salesmen.
Shareholders of the four-year-
old Keith Badgery and Lumby
received £lO,lOO in scrip, of
which £7500 was for goodwill.
Schute, Bell holders received
555. for each pref. and 555. for
each ord., both paid partly in
scrip; the public subscribed
44,150 £1 ords, at par. Profits
over the past five years have
averaged 7.6 p.c. on capital, last
year’s £8351 representing 8.1 p.c.
An issue of 59,000 shares at par
last term will yield a nice profit
to shareholders who accept the
355. now offered by N.Z. Loan
and Mercantile. This offer is
conditional upon a 75 p.c,
response from Schute, Bell share-
holders, the board of which has
recommended acceptance.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"RICHARD
THE THIRD."
In his presentation of
“Richard the Third” at Mel-
bourne Princess, Laurence
Olivier lifts portion of a speech
by Gloucester from “Henry VI”
and imports it into the famous
opening soliloquy of Richard.
Which is not a bad thing to do,
because Shakspeare had ob-
viously been brooding on the
type of character that Richard
was for a long time, and had
foreshadowed it so completely in
his previous play that the inter-
polation fits in very nicely.
Olivier doesn’t make Richard
the repulsive cripple some
tragedians have made him. All
he imparts to him is a mild
limp and a false nose of marvel-
lous disfavor. But he does bring
out much of the subtlety of his
nature, the intellectual power
Which lifted him above the half-
witted sheep with whom he was
surrounded and the vastness of
his obsession which distinguished
him from the rest of the nobility
of England. *
It says something for Olivier’s
production, with its gorgeous
costuming, its astute lighting and
its clever way of sliding one
scene into another, like turning
over the pages of a book of
illustrations, that it gives back a
great deal of the bustle and ex-
citement and savagery of Shak-
speare’s drama.
It is a one-man show domi-
nated by a single individual.
When he is off nobody is par-
ticularly interested in the san-
guinary proceedings, but when
the cause of all the bloodshed
returns it immediately becomes
intensely human. Those who
only know Olivier on the screen
don’t know how effective his
voice is. He seems to produce
it in the same way Melba did
hers in singing. It is a musical
pleasure to listen to his speeches,
even without considering their
content. But the quality of his
acting and his voice is such that
one moment he can make his
audience laugh and the next
can make it gape or shudder.
And he is the only member of
his cast who looks as if the
clothes he wears are natural to
him.
"An Inspector Calls. "
J, B. Priestley seems to take
an interminable amount of ver-
bosity to lead up to his “trick
endings,” and, theatrically effec-
tive as they may be, they don’t
excuse him for being an ineff-
able bore for the first two acts.
“An Inspector Calls,” currently
presented at Sydney Minerva, is
no exception —“We’re a lot of
sinners,” wails Mr. Priestley,
“and the goblins, or gremlins or
someone will get us if we don’t
mend our ways and learn by our
mistakes.”
He illustrates this terrifying
revelation with a play about a
smug Midlands family which is
visited by a mysterious inspector
with the news that a girl has
just committed suicide by taking
poison. The inspector extracts
from each member of the family
a confession of the part they
played in the events leading to
the girl’s death —the father
sacked hef from his mill, the
daughter had her dismissed from
a job in a milliner’s-shop, the
daughter’s fianc6 seduced her,
the son of the family did like-
wise and got her into trouble,
and the mother completed the
good work by refusing the
wretched girl aid when her child
was about to be born.
After the inspector departs,
leaving everyone with his or her
conscience, they work out that
he couldn’t have been real after
all and confirm their suspicions
by ringing the appropriate
authorities and discovering that
no suicide has been reported.
Then shortly afterwards, when
most of them are feeling very
relieved, the authorities return
the phone-call to say that a sui-
cide has just been brought in.
The trouble with Mr. Priest-
ley’s righteous melodrama is that
it is unfolded by everyone stand-
ing around and doing a tremen-
dous amount of talking—pro-
ducer John Sykes could have re-
lieved this a little by adding
more movement to the pro-
ceedings about things that
aren’t worth talking about. Lou
Vernon, as the inspector, gives
the most capable and impressive
performance even if he is some-
tinjes too solidly factual for the
mysterious character he por-
trays.
Two Goossens
Concerts.
The first of the brace of
N.S.W. Education Centenary
concerts given by the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra was not-
able for the fire and abandon of
Enith Clarke’s playing of the
Liszt Concerto No. 2 in A
Major.
The full-blooded runs, bold
proclamations and energetic
rhythms of this brilliant, lively
work call for muscularity and
digital nimbleness as well as for
the keen musical insight that
Liszt always needs. The soloist
was not found wanting in any
department. Dvorak’s Fifth
Symphony (“The New World”),
with it§ strange combination of
the negro idiom and the rich
classico - romantic style, was
finely played, with exceptionally
good work by the solo cor
anglais in the beautiful largo.
A well-knit group of excerpts
from “The Master singers” was,
as woven by Mr. Goossens and
his team, wholly delightful. A
symphonic sketch, “Andalusia,”
by the contemporary Spanish
composer De Grignon, was alive
with the warm rhythm and color
of the Iberian scene.
Musical sanity continued for
the first half of the second con-
cert : Beethoven’s “Coriolanus”
Overture, rich and dramatic;
Schubert’s Eighth Symphony
(“The Unfinished”), one of the
most enchanted outpourings in
symphonic writing; and the
Mozart Flute Concerto in G
Major, with Neville Amadio as
soloist.
After this royal procession
lumbered “Music from a Scene
from Shelley” by the contempor-
ary American Samuel Barber.
It proved to be a horrible botch
of sound, poor in construction
and about as close in spirit to
“Prometheus Unbound” as a
Spike Jones epic would be to
“King Lear.” Then came Stra-
vinsky’s suite from the ballet
“Card Game,” apparently in-
spired by St, Vitus, followed by
Ravel’s “Daphnis and Chloe,” a
work accorded far more import-
ance than its merit deserves,
despite its slickness of orches-
tration.
At the Films.
“A long time ago,” says
Ronald Colman in “A Double
Life,” at Sydney State, “there
was an actor named Kirby who
used to die so well that, when
the curtain fell, the audience
would cheer and clap and call
‘Die again, Kirby, die again.’
And Kirby would oblige them
by dying again.”
It’s a good story and apposite,
because Colman, as an actor
called Anthony John, is dying
after using the last scene of
“Othello” to stick a knife in him-
self. It might also be con-
sidered apposite because the pro-
longed death-scene —presumably
extended to enable Colman to
do a far, far better thing once
again—is the one superfluous
patch in an otherwise creditable
film.
The events leading up to the
suicide deal with an actor who
takes his stage roles into his pri-
vate life ; after playing “Othello”
for two years his mind becomes
a torment of the insane fears
and hates of jealousy and he
finally strangles a little waitress
with whom he had been having
an intermittent affair.
Colman’s performance is not
altogether consistent, but there
are flashes of brilliance in it
and, in the snippets from
“Othello,” he does manage to
achieve some of the bulk and
passion of the Moor.
Other current talkies sighted
include “The Private Life of a
Scoundrel” (Sydney Liberty), a
filmed version of Maupassant’s
story about an ex-soldier who
more-or-less seduced his way to
success. Most of the story is
there, but the acting and direct-
ing don’t measure up to it.
“The Secret Life of Walter
Mitty” (Sydney Regent) is a
long way from ,Thurber, but it’s
close to being the best that that
tiptop comedian Danny Kaye
has offered ; “It Happened on
Fifth Avenue” (Sydney Lyceum)
is a pleasant comedy in which
hobo Victor Moore all but steals
the show, and from Charlie
Ruggles that isn’t petty larceny;
murderer-hunting Barbara Stan-
wyck, “Crying Wolf” at Sydney
Plaza, is about as exciting as the
misjudged lamb Errol Flynn
turns out to be.
“The Road to Rio” (Sydney
Prince Edward) is the best of
that series that Hope and Crosby
have made ; “It Always Rains
on Sundays” (Sydney Victory)
is an excellent English drama
about the repercussions arising
when an escaped convict shelters
for a day with his erstwhile
mistress.
Paintings by Geoffrey Ander-
son at the Macquarie Galleries,
Sydney, are bright, decorative
and rigid. Except for flower-
pieces and “Rocks, Watson’s
Bay,” where there is a striking
shimmer of light on water, seen
over jagged rock, the paintings
are over-stylised ; an example of
an impressionist convention
settling into an unyielding habit.
An exhibition of pictures by
C.R.T.S. trainees at David
Jones’s Gallery, is very like, al-
though slightly better than, the
average mixed exhibition of
minor contemporary art groups.
There are Drysdale-influenced,
Herman-influenced, Dobell-influ-
enced paintings, a good deal of
slum property, but no war
horrors. There are also some
watercolors by Ron J. Laskie
of an interestingly high standard.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
You couldn’t say that the fete at Vic-
toria Barracks last Saturday wasn’t fes-
tive, although the rain fell on it. The
whole party, stalls, band, chocolate-wheels
and all, simply moved into the Drill Hall,
where the flags hanging from the rafters
waved wildly in the breeze of the music,
which was long and loud and very stirring.
Small children, sons and daughters of war-
riors of World War 11, were inspired by it
to impromptu little dances. There were
generals and colonels and majors of
World War I busy on the scene, too, for
the fete was in aid of the War Widows’
Guild. It was organised by the Eastern
Command’s Women’s Auxiliary, and the
Morshead lady made apt and graceful
opening speech. Lieut.-General Berry-
man and his wife, who is president of
the aifxiliary, were in front-line action all
the afternoon. Mrs. “Paddy” Moore,
Mrs. J. Mann and Mrs. Russell were
among the active workers. Major Joyce
Snelling did brisk business at the War
Widows’ Craft stall. A darts-board was a
great attraction, and there were small
home-made cakes served with the tea.
Colonel Ingate, from both World Wars,
was there with his wife. Mrs. Anne
Assheton, president of the guild, was a
visitor.
Cobbitty was the scene of what was the
State’s nearest approach to a Royal
wedding last Saturday. Warwick Fairfax,
chieftain of the “Sydney Morning
Herald,” was married in St. Paul’s Church
to Mrs. Hanne Anderson, second daughter
of the Emil Bendixsens of Copenhagen,
Denmark. Wedding was an exclusive
family affair.
It was not a fashionably-dressed audi-
ence that greeted Eileen Joyce’s opening
concert last week. But it was a mixture of
the intensely musical and those who, hav-
ing heard of Miss Joyce’s lovely clothes,
were determined to “see” her. Many
women say “I must see” instead of “I
must hear” Eileen Joyce. This probably
is because of the publicity given to the
pianist’s model frocks. Asa matter of
fact, when Eileen plays you wouldn’t care
if she were dressed in sackcloth and ashes.
She is superb. In the Chopin Sonata there
was a nobility of tone, a grave dignity
with which the rich white-corded silk
frock was in keeping. This was a Victor
Stiebel model made with a slim, long
bodice and a very full and sweeping skirt.
It had puffed, above-the-elbow sleeves,
and the bodice gleamed with gold sequins
and semi-precious stones. Avery graceful
concoction with a suggestion of the
medieval about it.
In the second part of the programme
Eileen wore kingfisher-blue thick silk.
This, too, was very long and full, and
had for complement a bolero glinting
ruby-red with sequin embroideries. Apart
from the pianist the girl of the night was
a small maiden of four or five who shyly
crept down from her perch on the tiered
seats on the stage to present a small posy
from her own garden and a letter written
all by herself to the musician. Some small
boys in the front row on the stage
managed to get the first autographs.
There were masses of flowers and salvoes
of applause and photographs and still
more photographs taken of Eileen on the
stage and later in the artist’s room with
the small posy-giver and some of the
small boys.
The beautifully-iced cake made by
Mrs. Greg McGirr in her North Sydney
home and sent to daughter Gwen across
the seas arrived in time for her wedding
breakfast. Dr. Gwen, who went tp
Ireland last year to do a post-graduate
course in obstetrics at the Rotunda in
Dublin, met Dr. Michael Fitz Patrick
there. If you know the silvery sheen that
can be over Dublin in the autumn days,
and the magic of Stephen’s Green, it’s no
wonder that romance bloomed. So the
two were wed, last week, in the Brompton
Oratory, London. N.S.W. Agent-General
Tully gave the' bride away, and Joan
Parkman, of Young, now studying in
London, was Gwen’s attendant. Michael
is the youngest son of the Edmund Fitz-
Patricks, of County Kerry, and he’s one
of his country’s crack footballers. Gwen
is the second daughter of the well-known
Greg McGirrs, and her wedding-frock of
rich white silk patterned with rosebuds,
and her tiny hat massed with waterlily
and lily-of-the-valley, lived up to the
tradition set by the two former brides in
the family.
With the arrival of Eamon de Valera,
for so long head of the Government of
Eire, in our midst last week this Letter
was reminded of a conversation in Dublin
in the days just before the world outbreak.
The speaker was a small man with the
bluest eyes and the reddest hair, and he
kept a store somewhere at the back of
Dublin Castle. This was his summing-
up of the way Eire .was being governed:
“Well, Ma’am, there are some that are
against Mr. de Valera. But there are
many that’s with him; for there were
years in this country, Ma’am, when many
a poor family did taste butcher-meat but
once or twice a year. And now, why,
last Christmas, Ma’am, there was hardly
a family couldn’t be eating turkey, if
they wanted it!”

ates and the Sydney University Gradu-
ates’ Association are joining forces and
are out to make May 11a night of nights.
The two allies have booked the Padding-
ton Town Hall for a ball, and the presi-
dent of the committee is the wife of Dr.
Roy Hurley. Her principal aides on the
committee are three undergrads: Eliza-
beth O’Brien, Helen Parry and Joan
Murray.
Off in the Orion to England goes
Barbara Cary with her mother, Mrs. H.
D. Cary, of Elizabeth Bay. They expect
to return in October, and then Barbara
gets busy in the matter of a wedding-
dress, for she 7 and Dr. Thomas (Tim)
Furber are arranging a December wed-
ding. The dress is the only article
of the wedding finery not already
stored away in tissue and lavender. Mrs.
Ian McLaurin, Mrs. Cary’s eldest
daughter, has been down from her Tam-
worth home paying a farewell visit to
mother and Barbara. The Furber family
has doctoring and yachting in its veins ;
the family-tree puts forth doctors and
commodores even as the fig-tree puts
forth little figs. Dr. T. Maynard Furber,
Tim’s father, is commodore of the Royal
Prince Edward Yacht Squadron, and
uncle Rupert former flag-officer of the
Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron at Kirri-
billi. This photograph of Barbara comes
from Dayne studio.
Eileen Joyce suggested the day after
tomorrow, so much of the “new look”
had she in her black afternoon frock and
small picture-hat dripping with pale-blue
ostrich fronds at a reception in her honor
last week. The Sydney Symphony
Orchestra committee were the hosts, and
the Royal Empire Society’s rooms held
a throng of music-lovers, mostly women.
The sex predominates at these afternoon
kettledrums because the ladies of the
committee go to them husbandless. The
nabobs and wallahs of the A.B.C. are the
only men on the landscape. Mrs. Hope
Gibson, who was active in the entertain-
ing, wore with her black afternoon
raiment a fascinating beret of lobelia
blue. The Frederick Jordan lady and the
Anderson lady were noted.
Mrs. Walter Swinson, who as a young
girl had -international fame as a pianist,
was among those deeply interested in
Miss Joyce. Red as the berries on the
shores of Lake Wakatipu was Mrs. Swin-
son’s velvet hat. Tall, good-looking Mrs.
George White was there, and so was her
violinist husband. Mrs. Rupert Scam-
mell, Dame Constance D’Arcy, Mrs. Sid-
ney Herring and Mrs. Walter Burfitt
were a happy group. The A.BC.’s Mr.
and Mrs. Boyer were there; so were the
Charles Moses couple—her color-choice
was burgundy red. FatherJSydney Mac-
Ewan, the tenor from Scofrand who will
sing throughout Australia under A.B.C.
direction, was warmly greeted by old
friend Dr. Barry. Professor Peart, of
the new chair of music at Sydney Uni-
versity, and his wife, Professor Dakin
and the B.B.C.’s Mr. Hutchinson seemed
to really enjoy the party. Melbourne’s
Mrs. John Kaufman’s outfit of deep
sapphire was served with beige Arctic
fox.
On three Wednesday nights, May 12,
19 and 26, the Mosman Theatre Guild
will present “Tony Draws a Horse,” a
sparkling light comedy which had a very
successful run in London. The play is
directed by Robin Jansen, who scored a
distinct success with his presentation of
“Fresh Fields.” The M.T.G. is a group
of drama-lovers who are working very
hard to establish theatre in their own
North of the Harbor community.
From Melbourne
Lovely as were some of the gowns in
the audience for the opening night of
“Richard III” at the Princess, none could
compare with the richness of velvet and
fragility of chiffon on the stage. Vivien
Leigh’s beauty was never more pro-
nounced than when she appeared as the
Lady Anne in a gown of white velvet,
blue velvet cape and medieval head-dress.
Lady Dugan, who was accompanied by
a party from G.H., wore a white ermine
cape bordered with silver-fox fur over
her gown of black romaine, Mrs. Holl-
way’s crepe gown of ice-blue had silver-
bead trimmings. Patricia Holschier added
a bolero of white broderie Anglaise to her
gown of white crepe. Veronica Syme
wore a bouffant gown of white georgette.
Lady Hyde’s choice was pale-mauve
chiffon. Green and silver combined
neatly in Nancy Cooper’s gown. Mrs.
Garnet Carroll’s heavy white crepes were
lavishly trimmed with gold beads; white
Arctic fox supplied the embellishment.
Lady Fuller’s gown was pastel-green, her
coat white ermine. The slim skirt of
Hilda Corbett’s white crepe gown was
slit at the centre seam and side-bordered
with silver beading. Lillian Welch allied
black tulle skirt and pink, beaded bodice.
Sue Boyd showed the off-the-shoulder
line in a white gown patterned in scar-
let. Joan Nesbit’s blue gown had the
draped shoulderline. Mrs. Maie Hoban’s
cloak of black velvet was worn over a
black crepe gown.
This is Rhoda Taylor, who is busy
organising the Coral Sea Ball, which will
be held in the St. Kilda Town Hall on
May 11. Rhoda, who does Public Re-
lations work for the Australia-America
Association, used to be with the U.S.
Information Library. Photo, from Holly-
wood Studios, Sydney.
» Mrs. R. G. Casey is president of the
Coral Sea Ball committee, and the func-
tion promises to be one of the season's
gayest. The foyer of the St. Kilda Town
Hall will be transformed into an island
market place where leis will be sold. The
stage will take the form of an island scene,
with life-sized palms, under which will
bask island maidens and men. The
official enclosure will be an interior of a
modern island home. The bandstand is
to be covered with fisher-netting, on which
will be scattered pictures of tropical fish.
The whole of the balcony will be sur-
rounded with hand-painted island scenes
12 feet high. There will be masses of
tropical fruit and hibiscus blooms on the
tables. Sarong-girls will sell leis, strings
of fruit and popcorn. Mrs. W. Plowright
is in charge of the decorations, and others
helping include Mrs. Ian Potter, head of
the catering committee ; Mrs. Eva Hayes,
who is a member of the ball committee ;
and ticket secretaries Mesdames B. Gul-
liver and D.. J. Lampard.
At the party given by the directors of
Georges at their Galleries in honor of
portrait-painter Professor Nicola Michai-
low and his daughter OlgaTt was a case
of “wassail all in the great hall” —the
wassail being a Bulgarian drink called
vince, a pleasant beverage with a de-
layed action. Assisting John George in
receiving the guests was Reta Findlay,
whose soft wool frock in “thunder grey”
was a Christian Dipr model and had
very much the “new look.” The skirt
carried a pleated panel at the back and
was cut plain in front; the short waist-
length jacket had curved lines and slop-
ing shoulders without pads. Her hat in
the same muted grey was adorned with
two feather quills. Olga Michailow’s
black jacket-suit was relieved with a bow
of white ermine set on the right shoulder ;
her bonnet-shaped black hat was trimmed
with black-satin-ribbon bows. Paddy
Wilkinson, whose portrait hung on one
wall of the gallery, wore a frock of
soft navy wool and a white-wool
beret. Her sister, Mrs. Edric Henty, was
in black, with a black-velvet, heart-
shaped, osprey-trimmed hat. Sonya
Yarr, who has come from U.S. to play
the lead in “Marinka,” the new musi-
comedy which opens soon at the Tiv.,
combined black lace and crepes under a
mink coat. Mrs. Douglas Stephens had
touches of red relieving her black hat
which was worn with a black frock. Mrs.
Hamilton Sleigh set off her beige coat
with a hat trimmed with upstanding black
ospreys. Emmeline Macbeth’s smartly-
tailored grey-flannel suit had London-
tan accessories.
Dame Enid Lyons, wearing a deep-
cream filmy lace grown and carrying a
bouquet of pastel and deep-pink roses,
received the nine debutantes at the annual
ball of the Sacre Cceur Old Girls’ Associa-
tion, which was held at St. Kilda Town
Hall. Autumn foliage, brought down
specially from Ferny Creek, was the main
decoration with the school colors of red,
white and gold comprising the flowers
which adorned the tables. Dame Enid
was met by the president of the Old Girls’
Association, Mrs. L. R. Buxton, whose
gown of white chiffon carried a pattern
of green and pink feathers ; diamond clips
were set in the shoulder-straps of the
bodice. Mrs.' H. Van Assche, organiser
of the ball, chose a gown of old-rose
crepe trimmed with gold sequins. Dame
Enid’s smile was a particularly happy
one for two,reasons: her daughter Rose-
mary led the debs, and a cable from
her daughter, the wife of Lt.-Col. M.
Austin, who are both in Washington,
told that Dame Enid had anew grand-
daughter.
In the official party were Air Vice-
Marshal and Mrs. F, M. Bladin, the
latter wearing a distinctive gown of blue-
rose-patterned satin, the skirt of which
had three bustle drapes at the back with
matching roses just below the waist, and
Frank O’Collins and his wife, she in a
gown of filmy-black lace over a gold
taffeta petticoat. Helen Skehan’s black
matt crepe gown was cut on slim-fitting
lines; Patric Whittam’s white-satin gown
had a hemline of colorful-striped satin.
Shelagh Doyle, who was responsible for
publicity, wore a ballerina frock of black
satin striped horizontally in emerald-green
and white. Maev O’Collins lent a dis-
tinctive note to her garnet-red velvet
bouffant gown, a cream-lace-edged
fichu neckline. Helen Gibson wore ,a
blue-and-silver lame gown with inlets of
blue tulle in the skirt and with a bustle
bow at the back. Judith Montague, over
from Yerong Creek, N.S.W., for the ball,
chose a bouffant white-lace skirt allied to
a black-velvet bodice and white-lace puff-
sleeves. Judith Silk had bands of green
and cyclamen taffeta at the top of the
low-cut bodice of her black-taffeta gown,
the same bright tonings repeated in the
large bustle bow at the back of the skirt.
At the party given by the International
Club in the Lower Town Hall guests
danced to the strains of an Austrian
orchestra, tall candles stood in liqueur-
bottles on each table and colored lights
hung from the ceiling. Many guests wore
Tyrolean costumes, and the supper served
was mostly Austrian food. Guests of
honor were the Lord Mayor and his
bride —they had been quietly married
earlier in the week. Lady Connelly’s
gown of powder-blue crepe romaine was
matched with a short tight-fitting jacket,
trimmed with blue sequins. Organising
secretary of the club, Mrs. G. H. Har-
greave, chose a slifn-cut magnolia-satin
gown over which she wore a tailored coat
of red velvet. Convenor of the National
Group, Mrs. King Mouy, was at the
official table with the president of the
club, Mrs. Herbert Brookes. Other
official guests included Lady Harrison
Moore, Mrs. G. Swinburne and Mrs. I. H.
Moss.
Lavish costumes and decor make a
suitable background for French star of
the Casino de Paris, Micheline Bernardini,
who is appearing in the current Tivoli
show “Vive la Venus.” Gold cellophane
was used to make effective wigs worn
by the ballet in one scene ; another strik-
ing ballet was one in which the dancers
garbed in pink and black created the
illusion of reflections seen in large gilt-
framed mirrors. Jenny Howard made her
first appearance in spectacular black-
and-white tulle. In the audience
were Dr. McDermott and his wife, her
ensemble in dove-grey crepe. Mrs. Peter
Ree wore a short musquash coat with her
new-length black georgette frock. Mr.
and Mrs. S. Aarons, the Norman Lynches
accompanied by son Paul, Roy and
Hazel Honeyman and Mr. and Mrs. W.
Graves were others who enjoyed a
sparkling show.

THE SERVICE MAN
War in Palestine.
“Ek Bum”: For months it
has seemed certain that as soon
as the British left Palestine open
war would break out if there
were not some decisive steps
taken by the Great Powers to
preyent it.
It became more certain when
the Evatt committee’s remark-
able and almost unbelievable
scheme for the partition of
Palestine was put forward.
There is not much of Pales-
tine to partition. It is only 9970-
odd square miles, without 700
miles of lake, and this is popu-
lated roughly on the scale of
100 to the square mile-lakes,
prickly-pear country, mountains
picked as clean as a* whistle by
the teeth of people who have
wasted nothing for about 3000
years,
Muddled Rule
When the armistice was
signed in 1918 there were 55,000
Jews in Palestine. Now there
are about 600,000 Jews to
1,200,000 Arabs. The States-
man's Year-Book says: ,
Four-fifths of the increase in the
Jewish population has been con-
tributed by immigration. The in-
crease in the Arab population is due
to natural increase resulting from the
high birthrate.
In the great centres such as
Jerusalem the Jews dominate.
Jerusalem ,is about two-thirds
Jewish already—there are 47,000
more Jews there alone than there
were in the whole of Palestine
in 1917. Tel Aviv (166,000), the
main commercial city, is wholly
Jewish. Half Haifa’s 128,000-
odd are Jews.
The country is not very pro-
ductive. It turns off in a really
good year about 200,000 tons of
grain, or one ton per year to
every nine of the population,
and it has only about 250,000
cattle and 250,000 sheep. Ex-
ports of Palestine produce in
1939 were valued at £P5,117,769,
against imports for consumption
valued at £P 14,632,000, and
with population pouring in the
position has not improved since.
It seems that with the Evatt
partition in operation, the Arabs
not only of Palestine, but of
.Transjordan, and others
who trade through Palestinian
ports, would have to submit to
the commercial domination of
the Jews. The interest of
Transjordan and of other areas
further east is therefore not
merely academic, and neither is
that of the Syrians in the north
and the Egyptians in the south.
Feeling is deep and practical
whatever the truth about Arab
fecklessness and failure to de-
velop his countries. 1
The disturbing events of the
past year—illegal immigration,
murders of British soldiers and
civilians, bomb outrages by both
sides—reached their culmination
in a state of affairs somewhat
as follows on April 18. The firm
hand of British rule had beenl
withdrawn to such an extent
that the country was in disorder,
had ceased to be a whole and
was a whirling chaos of sorties,
gunfire, assassination and bomb-
ing. On April 18 three inno-
cent British soldiers were killed
and three injured when an
ammunition train was mined
and held up by Jews who stole
20 tons of automatic ammuni-
tion. Haifa, half Jewish, half
Arab, a main British port, was
seized by the Jews except for
the port area.
British Military Action
Disintegration became chaos.
Lieutenant-General G. H. Mac-
millan was forced to take warlike
action to prevent the destruction
of the last vestiges of British
authority.
The Jev.s, having taken Haifa,
were fighting their way into
Jaffa, not a Jewish city and not
part of the Jewish State pro-
posed by U.N.O. and not even
inside the boundaries of Jewish
territory which the Jews declare
that they intend to adopt on
August 16.
They had also established
blocks across the road north of
Jerusalem, denying the highway
to Arabs and also threatening the
safety of the tail-end of the
evacuation forces —the Jews of
Haganah and Irgun are pre-
pared to murder and rob any-
one who is suspected of having
a cartridge about him. Probably
the Arabs are of the same mind.
General Macmillan demanded
that these blocks should be
withdrawn, and when there was
no answer he sent in the High-
land Light Infantry—the fellows
who saved the situation for the
Americans at the Kasserine Pass
in North Africa five years ago—
with Cromwell tanks, • 25-
pounders, bazookas and mortars.
Meanwhile British troops were
in action against two other pieces
of Jewish aggression.
Jaffa Attacked
Late on the night of April 25,
3000 members of the Irgun Zvai
Leumi had attacked the wholly
Arab city of Jaffa. Jaffa is
cheek-by-jowl with Tel Aviv,
which is Jewish and the largest
city in Palestine (166,000-odd).
All streets leading from Jaffa
were barricaded off. The Arabs
offered little resistance to the
terrorist onslaught. The Jews
soon included British armored
cars in Jaffa in their attentions.
They were not the only
attackers of British, however, for
the Arabs had done their little
bit of firing on them, following
a statement by Sir Alan Cun-
ningham, British High Commis-
sioner, that the seizure of Haifa
on the previous Thursday by
Haganah had been provoked by
Arabs firing unwarrantably upon
Jews in the town.
By April 28 British units were
breaking up the attack on Jaffa,
using armor and Spitfires. They
had also been under the neces-
sity of firing heavily upon Jewish
mortar units which were bom-
barding Acre, an historic port
packed to the rim with unfortu-
nate Arab refugees. At this
point it could be said that
Palestine presented a dreadful
picture of bloodstained ruin.
Jerusalem was half-empty and
half-looted, with great gaps in
its irregular outline left by bomb
outrages. Both Government de-
partments were shut down and
both Jewish and Arab civil ser-
vants had hurried off to collect
their automatics and a little
ammunition. The exit roads
were streaming with refugees
departing on and in every sort
of transport for parts in which
they were likely to find just as
much mortar-fire, bombing and
sniping as in the Holy City* itself.
Meanwhile greater unity had
been obtained among the Jewish
forces by the signing of a pact
of co-operation between the
Haganah which has always
'professed to be shocked and
hostile to terrorism and the
terrorist Irgun Zvai Leumi,
which hereafter will co-operate.
While this was going on
U.N.O. was in a state almost
as chaotic as that of Palestine
itself. There were times in the
debate when onlookers were
pleased that the delegates were
unarmed, and there was a sudden
and unexplained return of Rus-
sian delegates, who had been
snarling in the wings and whose
agencies in Moscow and else-
where have been encouraging
now one side and ndw the other,
so as to make sure, apparently,
that there will ultimately be war.
War on the Doorstep
From Irak to the Turkish
border in Syria, from Lebanon
through Transjordania, the
Arabs have never had any
intention foe months save
to take over Palestine and
include it in the Arab
State of Transjordania under
King Abdullah, whose troops
were massed at Ammon on April
28, with a spearhead of the Arab
Legion inside the Palestine
border in the Jericho region
ready to act on King Abdullah’s
dictum that “War is the only
solution to the Palestine prob-
lem.” It was officially announced
in Syria the same day that the
armies of Syria, Lebanon, Egypt,
Transjordan and Irak had signed
an agreement in Ammon to open
a three-front campaign in
tine.
At the week-end the situation
was confused. Statements that
Arab forces from Egypt, Syria
and Lebanon were on the move
in invasion were made and
denied. The fact was that if
any moves were being made by
the Arabs they were not likely to
give their hands away. Entry
would be into the territories of
their own parts of the “parti-
tion” where the borders run
along Transjordania, north of
the Red Sea and along the
Lebanon line in the Far North.
The Jaffa situation was the
most serious element. The tak-
ing-over of this town ’by the
Jews was a flat infraction of the
partition terms, since it was one
of the Arab areas and the only
Arab port provided for the large
“Get those laundry people on the phone—I'll put some
starch in their collars!”
Arab State between the coastal
plain and the Dead Sea.
The British were due to move
out on May 15, when their man-
date ends, but they obviously
intend to leave behind, if pos-
sible, an existing Government or
Governments.
By May 2 they had troops dis-
posed around the supposed
neutral ground of Jerusalem to
prevent the approach of either
Arab or Jewish forces. The
Government on May 3 called
for a cease-fire in the Holy City
to permit the negotiation of a
truce. There had been fighting
in Jerusalem on a battalion scale
over the latter f)art of the week,
British armor had been inter-
posed between Jews and Arabs
in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area.
British troops and armor were
being moved in from Suez and
across the desert and were on
their way in other convoys from
Cyprus and Malta.
There were signs that what
was happening in Jerusalem and
Jaffa was only preparation for
full-scale war.
The Blain Incident.
The Australian radio-listening pub-
lic was not allowed to hear the
House of Representatives debate on
the letter which Mr. A. M. Blain,
the fighting member for the Northern
Territory, sent to the Prime Minister
asking for an inquiry by a panel of
High Court Judges into charges
made against the Speaker and the
Attorney-General, whose suspension
he proposed pending the inquiry.
A.B.C. chose to broadcast a trivial
Senate debate instead.
Mr. Blain wrote that, as a matter
of public duty, he had asked a ques-
tion in Parliament about what was
alleged to be some illegal building
without a permit in the Attorney-
General’s home, at a time when re-
turned .soldiers were being heavily
fined for adding rooms to houses to
accommodate their wives. He said
that Dr. Evatt had sent for him
and, in the presence of Mr. A. G.
Cameron, M.P., had pleaded with
him to withdraw the question. He
had agreed to do so temporarily,
since Dr. Evatt was going abroad.
When he repeated the question Dr.
Evatt had given an assurance that the
building was legal, and the Prime
Minister had asked for “notice.”
“Notice” given, the Speaker had re-
fused to accept the question.
Subsequently, - having been ccm-
cerned in requests for information
about an official who, he was told,
was dying of tuberculosis, which was
not a fact, he heard that threat's had
been made by Dr. Evatt that if he
did not cease asking questions
awkward for the Government certain
matters on his record in Malaya
would be brought to light and ex-
posed.
Later, while criticising the Speaker
in the House for a Sydney Domain
attack on High Court Judges, he
had heard Mr. Rosevear address
him from the seat of the member for
Dailey; but being deaf from injuries
received in Malaya he could not catch
what was said. He was told
that Mr. Rosevear had accused him
of showing his gold pass to the
Japanese. Presently the charge was
made by Mr. Mulcahy, member for
Lang.
When an inquiry by a Com-
mittee of Privilege was held Dr.
Evatt was made chairman. Blain said
he had mentioned to the commit-
tee that he had been told that Mr.
Rosevear had first made the charge,
but no notice had been taken by the
cop.mittee or by Mr. Rosevear. He,
and not Mr. Mulcahy, had been tried
by the Committee of Privilege, and
he had not been allowed to cross-
examine witnesses or to be present
when they were heard. Nor was he
supplied with a copy of the evidence.
Mr. A. G. Cameron, M.P. for
Barker, moved the adjournment of
the House to permit discussion. He
said that one member of the Com-
mittee of Privileges had been Mr.
Clark, who had become a material
witness the moment Mr. Mulcahy
had named him in evidence. In
view of questions pqj by Mr. Wil-
liams, M.P. for Robertson and a
member of the committee, that mem-
ber’s attitude appeared to be that of
a prosecutor against Mr. Blain. In
effect, the accuser was not called upon
to prove his charge; the accused was
required to prove his innocence.
The Government, as in the Keane
Trunks Case, took to the hollow
log. The Prime Minister contented
himself with saying that Mr. Blain
was a gallant soldier who had suffered
much, but had brought charges com-
pletely ludicrous. In regard to Dr.
Evatt’s building, he had gone through
the files and the Attorney-General’s
breach was an “unwitting breach” —
without explaining what happened to
some members of the general public
found guilty of “unwitting breaches.”
The P.M. declared that “if the letter
had not come from such a man
as Mr. Blain he would have thought
the writer was slightly unbalanced.”
Dr. Evatt denied that the Commit-
tee of Privileges had made Mr. Blain
a defendant. His own breach of build-
ing law —“if there was a breach” —
was a purely technical one which in-
volved structural alterations for which
certain authorities believed a permit
was necessary. However, “an ex-
planation was accepted.” He did not
say that if a permit was needed the
cost must have exceeded £25 and
that any breach above that amount
was prosecutable. He did say that
everything about the Blain case had
to be looked at “from the viewpoint
of a man who had suffered in the
•service of his country,” and he was
“deeply hurt that Mr. Blain should
consider him a mortal enemy.”
Mr. Rosevear, from the floor of the
House, described Mr. Blain’s letter
as “a document which even Mr.
Blain’s best friend would not describe
otherwise than as the vaporings of
a disordered mind and a victimisa-
tion complex.” He made no refer-
ence to his having been charged with
asserting that the gallant Northern
Territory member showed his gold
pass to the Japanese.
The country is entitled to an
assurance that the Speaker did not
make this foul statement. He will
have that opportunity when the House
returns to the Blain affair next month,
for the last has not been heard of
it by any means.
“K.”: The Royal Engineers
have completed the first stage
of a great water-supply project
in Kenya as part of the con-
struction of the “East African
stores - holding organisation,”
which is taking the place of the
British Army’s former depot in
Egypt. MacKinnon-road was
formerly a waterless and unin-
habited waste in the interior of
Kenya. The water had to be
pumped from the Tsavo River,
in famous lion country, and
lifted through purifying plants
to a highest point at Voi, 2000 ft.
above sea-level. The sappers
on the job told the “Times”
correspondent that they had
to undertake the heavy extra
labor of burying all the pipe-
lines because “thirsty ele-
phants smell out water like old
soldiers smell, out beer,” and
“made short work of pipes left
above ground.” Even so, the
gangs returning to the job in the
mornings would find “elephants,
rhinoceroses and lions sleeping
in the soft earth of a pipe trench
made the day before.” Shoot-
ing was by order barred, but the
sappers show with pride a
game-book in which the num-
bers of big game spotted daily
and their behavior are recorded.

Communist activity flared up
everywhere in the Near and Far
East last week. Moscow Radio
became once more the champion
of Palestinian partition. In
Greece martial law was declared
after a young Communist threw
three hand-grenades into the car
of the Greek Minister for Jus-
tice, M. Ladas, killing him and
a policeman. And in Korea the
Russian puppet Government of
the North, supported by Russian-
trained and -armed troops,
adopted a constitution on the
Russian pattern and made
moves across the border. When
this was written all United States
forces in Korea were on the
alert. The position was highly
inflammable and dangerous.

Foul weather took a bit of a hand
in turf proceedings on Saturday, ine
Stradbroke Handicap meeting in Bris-
bane had to be postponed; New-
castle’s big meeting, with the Cameron
Handicap the main event, was held,
but under dreadful conditions, as
was the S.T.C.’s turnout at Rosehill.
The Cameron went to Melgoda, a
six-year-old son of Melfort. Melgoda
was ridden by E. Doon, who is get-
ting away well on the right foot as
he commences his career as a fully-
fledged jockey; he was on the win-
ners of four of the eight races run
at Newcastle.
At Rosehill punters had mixed
luck, yet could consider themselves
fortunate, in view of the conditions,
to have had three favorites and a
couple of other well-backed horses
successful. The best turn-up of the
day for bookies was the success of
Bankman (J. Peterson) in the first
Parramatta Mixed Stakes (7f.); he
started at 50 to 1. The second
division was won by the speedy Ajax
colt Mine Host (R. Coles), clocking
the surprisingly good time of 1.25 T
Run over 10 furlongs, the Auburn
Mixed Stakes went to Miss Corrogin
(E. Fordyce).
The less-experienced apprentice
riders were given a chance in the
Flying, conditions of which provided
that riders should be limited to those
who had ridden fewer than five win-
ners. Giving J. Tuite his first win-
ning ride, Pennicuik just nutted
Tynedale, with Gimcrack Stakes-
winner Nechi next best.
Having only his second run after
a lengthy spell, El Senor, at 12 to 1,
was the rank outsider of the small
field contesting the Rosehill Handi-
cap (10f.), but he won it well. W.
Cook rode a model race on the
Marconigram-El Senorita gelding,
who finished on much too stoutly for
Fra Diavolo, Courier and the others.
F. W. Hughes had three runners
in the Two-year-old Handicap for
fillies, and, not surprisingly, got
among the prizemoney. His Madame
Du Barry (A. Hazelton), starting at
twelves, ran out a very easy winner;
three lengths further back, Skiva,
another of Hughes’s string, deadheated
with San Mateo for second place.
Rewarding consistency and atoning
for some ill-luck, warm favorite Blue
Diamond (J. Waterhouse) took the
Two-year-old for colts and geldings.
He had been in the minor money at
each of his three previous starts.
The finish of the nine-furlongs
Welter, run in pelting rain, was fought
out by the two topweights; Frontal
Attack (W. Cook) with 9.3 just
shaded Deed, who carried a pound
more. Frontal Attack should win
more and better races when he tackles
ordinary middle-distance handicaps
with their lighter scale of weights.
* * * *
Although he did win two races,
jockey A. Breasley had very stiff
luck at Mentone on Saturday; two
of his mounts lost photo.-finishes by
margins of a half-head, and another
was beaten a neck.
Both two-year-old events, divisions
of the Cranbrook Handicap, were
disappointments for Breasley and,
with him, a fair percentage of punters.
Ralton, his mount in the first, started
favorite and was just pipped by
Trellis (W. Williamson). In the
second he was on the well-backed
Mark You, who found Gateman (S.
Ralph) a trifle too strong at the
finish. Close finishes were the order
of the day, five of the eight races
being won by margins of a neck or
less.
Breasley’s luck took a turn for
the better when favorite Dumfries,
lumping a steadier of 9.9, accounted
for Beau John, Sandy Bay and other
three-year-olds contesting the mile
Ellesmere Handicap. Breasley’s other
winner was Rubontine, who won the
mile Dukesborough Handicap from
Bronx and Spearflame. His other
near-miss was on River Hero, beaten
by High Production' (and the handi-
capper) in the Leicester Handicap of
six furlongs; Broadcast was third.
Most of the races at Mentone went
to well-backed horses, but Heather
Rose (25 to 1) and First Fiddle (16
to 1) gave the books a bit of a
look-in. Ridden by R. Hutchinson,
the Caithness mare Heather Rose
turned on a rather startling reversal
of form to win the Ascot Thousand
(lOf.) from Gayness and Hororata.
With L. Whittle up, First Fiddle had
the easiest of wins in the Tottenham
Handicap (13f.); Lord Bian and
Nantilla were in the minor places.
The Seacombe Hurdle, of a shade
over two miles, went to Lord Cavil
(H. Toomer).
For Randwick (before acceptances):
Novice: Mortar, 1; Barita, 2;
Altarian, 3. Two-year-old Handicap:
Foxzami, 1; Grand Romance, 2;
Vimy Ridge, 3. Juvenile Stakes (fil-
lies): Oasis, 1; Tidal, 2; Skiva, 3.

Host, 2; Tynedale, 3. James Barnes
Plate: Frontal Attack, 1; El Senor,
2; Blue Legend, 3. Welter: Leetona,
1; Slander, 2; Deed, 3.

Passed on in Sydney recently, two
leading sporting scribes in A. R. B.
(“Pedlar”) Palmer and Bill Russell.
Palmer was 62,, and his reporting
specialties had been cricket and both
Rugby codes; he was formerly sec-
retary of the N.S.W. Rugby Union.
Bill Russell’s field was the turf —one
of the several good racing writers
“reared” by the old “Referee.”

The Australians in England;
The Australian team opened its
tour with the customary win over
Worcestershire; this time by an
innings and 15 runs—Australia 462
for eight wickets (closed), Worcester
233 and 214. Previous wins over
the county were 176 in 1926, innings
and 165 in 1930, innings and 297 in
1934 and innings and 77 in 1938.
The irrepressible Bradman rattled up
107, his 31st century in England, but
a mere drop in the bucket compared
with his 236 in 1930, 206 in 1934
and 258 in 1938 against the county.
Batting slowly, left-hander Arthur
Morris (138) joined the few Aussies
who have made a century in their first
innings on English soil; Miller (50,
not out), Barnes (44), Hassett (35),
Lindwall (32) and Brown (25) helped
bolster the total. Thirty-six-year-old
P. F. Jackson, who has been the
county mainstay bowler in recent
years, got 6 for 135, and joined the
list of Test possibilities. For Aus-
tralia, spin bowlers McCool (6 for
67), lan Johnson (6 for 127) and
Toshack (3 for 79) did best; the fast
bowlers’ bags were meagrely filled by
Lindwall (2 for 60) and Miller (1
for 64). Interesting sidelights were
umpires’ passing of Lindwall’s “drag”
over the bowling crease —“noticeable,”
according to English observers; ultra-
vociferods appeals by Toshack and
Miller which didn’t awe the umpires;
and the exultant cry “I’ve got him!”
when wicketkeeper Yarnold thought
he’d caught Bradman.
The tourists took their gear to
Leicestershire on Saturday, when six
players who were omitted from the
opening fixture were given a turn. The
changeover was doubtless intended to
give all player's a taste of English
weather vagaries; they certainly got
it in bleak wind and rain. But again
it was the “regulars” who kept them-
selves warm; Miller (175 not out)
Bradman (81), Barnes (78) and Brown
(26), and the day ended with 407 for
8 wickets on the board in five hours.
Ex-Australians Jackson (4) and Walsh
(2), who have been the county’s
stalwarts in recent years, got most
wickets.
On the Union front, Randwick beat
East, 5-3, in a rugged game at Coogee
oval, Wallaby forward Nick Shehadie
being sent off, Wallaby full-back Brian
Piper being injured, and the staunch
Randwick supporters ‘waxing highly
indignant. In more sedate fashion
Drummoyne beat North, 13-12, and
University tossed West, 11-9. Jim
Boland, Parramatta’s half, was chiefly
responsible for his side’s 6-3 win over
Eastwood. Manly downed Gordon
9-6 in a muddy game which never-
theless gave the brilliant backs Walker
“Before we go any further, Yank, do you think I'll be able
to claim for rehabilitation under the Marshall Plan ?”
(Manly) and Allan (Gordon) oppor-
tunity to shine. St. George, which
had the bye, went to Armidale and
beat New England, 14-3.
* * * ♦
Mr. de Valera, ex-Prime Minister of
Eire, saw a couple of the V.F.L. games
on Saturday and found them “robust”
and “bright,” with a “lot, to resemble
Gaelic football” whatever that is.
So far as can be ascertained, no
policeman was assaulted during the
day. Under the De Valeran eye
Fitzroy assaulted Melbourne at
M.C.G. and were so far in front
that he left for North Melbourne,
leaving ’Roy to its 12.14-6.12 win.
At North he saw a fast, bustling
game which “Sowth” won, 13.16-
10.11. The real game was at Gee-
long, where the locals trailed Carlton
into the last quarter and then staged
a burst that just missed by two
points, Carlton, 13.11 to 12.15. Foots-
cray walloped Hawthorn, 12.12-6.9;
Essendon downed Collingwood, 16.12-
14.9; Richmond galloped all over St.
Kilda, 15.16-11.12.
* * * *
Somewhere round a quarter of a
century back a cullud pug named
Patterson was imported, with appro-
priate ballyhoo, to fight Sid Godfrey,
i Evidently Godfrey, too, was taken in
by the splurge of advance publicity;
he treated Patterson with ludicrous
caution for a couple of rounds be-
fore letting loose a more-or-less ex-
ploratory punch; it sat Patterson back
in the opposite corner and that was
the end of that.
There’d have been an even greater
fiasco had a more recent cullud im-
port, “Buck” Edwards, been put in
the same ring with Vic. Patrick, as
had been intended. Cables from
America burst the Edwards bubble,
and it was conveniently discovered
that he’d have had to concede Patrick
too much weight. Instead he was
matched at Sydney Stadium last week
with the Filipino, Little Paras.
Though obviously unready for the
scrap, Paras was far too good for
Edwards in one of the dullest “fights”
ever seen.
* * * *
At Melbourne Stadium, 20-year-old
Bob Lawson (list.), who hails from
Mt. Gambier, outpointed the Vic.
welter champion Jacky Daniels (10.12)
over 12 rounds.
* * # *
The matching of middleweights Rex
Murphy (list.) and Joe Upton (11.3)
at Leichhardt provided a crowd-
pleaser, though the decision, Murphy’s
way, was not cheered to the echo.
Much the better boxer, Murph. had
won clearly on points, but Upton’s
continued aggression persuaded a sec-
tion of the mob that he had at least
earned a draw. Both were slugging
away furiously, toe-to-toe, at the final
bell, but every part of Upton’s dial
carried the marks of Murphy’s clean,
snappy punching.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Blime”: It happened to a cobber
of mine last season. He lived in
the one-room shack on his plape, and
when shearing came round he puzzled
over quarters for the three hands who
would live on the job. With what
material he could muster he added a
closed-in verandah for meals, put three
beds into the shack for the hands and
shifted, his own ancient bunk into a
corner of the woolshed. The smell was
shattering, but by propping the door
wide and dragging his bed across the
opening, Dan managed to stay the dis-
tance till daylight called him out to cook
the men’s breakfasts. Shearing was
almost finished when the union bloke
swooped. “Call those decent living-
quarters?” he demanded, after inspecting
the shack. “Awright, you’ll have to make
it up to the shearers by paying extra.
Three pound a hundred, you under-
stand?” “Righto,” Dan agreed ruefully.
“And their living free,” continued the
rep. Again Dan nodded. “And you’ll
pay their tax,” authority commanded.
“Aw, cripes, not that,” Dan broke in
urgently. “Hang it, me place won’t
stand it.” “And their tax,” reiterated
the voice relentlessly. “You owners must
learn to provide up-to-date conditions
and conveniences for the men, see?
Their accommodation has got to be the
same as what you’d have for yourself,
and don’t forget it,”
* * *
“Lower Tops’l”: A well-known land-
mark under Gabp (Vic.) has disappeared.
It is the old Riverina wreck, which has
stood with her masts, funnel and super-
structure intact, beside the long sweeping
sandy shore between Mallacoota Inlet and
Gabo Island, since she grounded there
in a fog with 142 passengers on board on
Easter Sunday night, 1927. However,
the memory of the wreck will live on in
East Gippsland. The ship’s fine teak
panelling went ashore to Mallacoota
years ago, where it has since been meta-
morphosed into houses and boats. At
Cann River the vessel’s staircases and
fittings form part of the hotel, while at
Mallacoota the saloon panelling and doors
line the post-office and, also, poet E. J.
Brady’s study, which, incidentally, com-
mands a magnificent view of the scene of
the wreck towards the picturesque gum-
fringed inlet.
* * * *
“Hanko”: Bindertwine was at the tail-
end of a bender, craving sympathy and
bursting to unburden himself. “I was
about t’ pick out a few fats for market,”
he told us, “when the missus comes
waddlin’ to the yards.” ‘C’morn,’ she
shouts, ‘hand over that there knob o’ blue
y’ pinched t’ raddle yer old sheep with.’
‘Strike a light,’ I tells her, T alwus raddle
’em red, don’t I?’ ‘Y’ didn’t raddle the
last lot red when I missed a knob o’ blue,’
she nags. ‘Y’ must think I’m color-blind.
Anyhow, there’s a knob o’ blue gorn
now, the last I had.’ ‘Then a bower-bird
muster took it,’ I moans. ‘Where’s a
bower-bird’s playground around here?’
she asks. ‘Over in the gully by that clump
of myrtles,’ I ses. She was back in ten
minute.s; puffin’ an’ grittin’ her teeth.
‘There isn’t any knob o’ blue in the
bower,’ she sports. ‘Only a doll’s eye, a
coupler bits of castor-oil bottle an’ some
sprigs of forget-me-not.’ Then her eyes
lit on the sheep I’d —er —blued, an’ that
started a blue never found in no bower-
bird’s bower, an’ it put me on the biggest
bender fer a blue-moon.”
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Have never
seen natural gum-blossoms in the Vic-
torian bush until last week at Malla-
coota, where bloodwoods everywhere
were in flower. Looking ashore from the
inlet at least a Quarter of the bpsh was
topped with white flowers, which have
attracted to the district countless thou-
sands of red lowries. At the same sea-
son two years ago when I was there
there wasn’t a bloodwood in blossom.
The locals say that this eucalyptus—it is
found in Victoria only in East Gipps-
land —only flowers in odd seasons.

“Bosun’s Mate”; With all respect to
“Nor’-west’s” dad, who was in the first
Atlantic cableship in 1858 (B. 21/4/’4B),
cable-laying has advanced somewhat in
90 xpars. Modern stress machinery on
both bow and stern of cable-ships ensures
that the wire is not looped from crag to
crag, but follows with its sinuous weight
every configuration of the sea-bottom.
A skipper who left a loop high enough

for whales to scratch under would soon
find himself on a river ferry. Moreover,
the Encyclopedia Britannica does not
agree that the teredo has no partiality
to cables. “To protect the insulation [of
a modern submarine cable] against injury

“Mat’s Mate’,!; We were up in the Vic.
Mallee when the football season broke
out, and, since we were camped about
half-way between Linga and Boinka,
sorties from both hamlets presently began
seeping through the scrub in efforts to
kidnap, bribe or corrupt Mat into one
or the other side, he having disclosed his
form in a bit of a practice match. Boinka
opened with a six months" clearing con-
tract at big money ; Linga raised the bid
with a better one ; Boinka guaranteed a
harvest job to follow the contract.; Linga
produced a wheat-agent with a lumping
proposition. Mat remained noncom-
mittal, the contestants withdrew to con-
sider, the opening game drew nearer. A
deputation arrived from Underbool,
secretly, and was refused. A letter from
Cowangie was ignored. I, who usually
roved to Mat’s ruck or was full-forward
to his centre, was beginning to think
nobody would want us when a kid arrived
on a flea-bitten hack and inquired,
“Who’re you blokes goin’ t’ play for?”
“What d’ y’ want to know for?” we
asked. “T* settle the Masted arguments
at our place. Me two brothers play f’r
Linga an’ me two sisters go with two
blokes playin’ for Boinka. Fair dinkum,
Mister, it’d give y’ the willies.” “Who do
you barrack f’r?” “Linga, o’ course.
Man’s got t’ stick against them silly
wimmen.” Mat grinned. “Y’ can settle
that argument,” he said. “It’s L’inga.”
• * * «
“Curate’s Egg”: In plumping for the
Moonee (s.-w. Q.) country as the terrain
with the greatest density of reptilian
population in Australia, Spinifex’ Sam
claimed that he had killed -10 snakes
while waiting for his quartpot to boil.
In response to disbelieving chidings, Sam,
reluctantly conceding that he might have
stretched it a bit, admitted that it might
have been only nine, or perhaps eight,
or even’seven that he killed. When Long
Harry remained ribaldly sceptical Sam
dropped his tally to six, but, suddenly
sensing that he was losing ground, he
jumped off his bunk and yelled “I killed
five of the blanks, and I’ll, fight before
I come down another snake!”
* * * *
“Muskeen”: At a racing stables in
Victoria Blue Bonny, Our Land, Larch-
wyn, Arabint, Keller Star and a gelding
by Larchwood are in training. All these
horses are white or grey, so maybe
white animals are losing their reputation
for weakness (B. 21/4/’4B). And —er —
pardon me, but has anyone ever seen an
effete polar-bear?
* * * *
“Bughous e”: “J. O’Keeffe” (B.
7/4/’4B) is right: light can penetrate any-
where, even to the depths of the sea and
the earth. For we have arrived at the
theory that there are no such things as
solids, anyway; that what appears to
be solid is merely the result of intense
speed ; that all matter, resolved into its
ultimate atoms, consists of congeries of
infinitely small electrical charges revolv-
ing around one another ; that the more
of such particles there are in any one
congerie so* do its weight and solidity
increase. So, with even the most solid-
seeming substances no more than speed-
ing electricity’ there is no reason why
rays travelling at a sufficient speed
should not find a way in between speed-
ing electrons. For light and ’"electricity
are themselves the same thing—as we
prove every time we pull down a switch,
which allows the previously invisible
electricity, resident in the cable, to be-
come visible as light through the medium
of our lamp filaments.
* ■ * * *
“L. Lefroy”: There used to be a night-
well on the way to Jerramungurup (s.-w.
W.A.), Originally an abo drinking-place,
it was enlarged by Groper teamsters to
a capacity’of about 100 gallons. Dry
most of the summer day, it would start
to fill about an hour after sundown and
would be at a maximum about midnight.
This it would retain, unless bailed out,
until about an hour a£ter sunrise, when
it would start slowly to subside. Geolo-
gistic explanation was that in the adja-
cent low hillside lay a sizable reservoir
which gathered the seepage from higher
country. Covering this reservoir was a
dome of rock, thin enough to be influ-
enced by the sun’s heat. Thus during
the hot day the dome expanded and
rose, allowing mope seepage water to
pour in. With the cold of the night came
the reverse, the dome contracted, forcing
the day’s gain of water out. This found
escape by crevices through or over a low
rock dyke, thus filling the night-well out-
side. When day came again and the dome
expanded part of the contents of the
well retreated into the reservoir, the rest
soaking away in the poorly-holding soil.
The above could be proved by the arrival
of a camel-train. With the well bailed
all at a slowly diminishing level,
it would finally peter out, and would re-
quire several days to return" to normal.
♦ * * *
“Sou’-west”: Well, I don’t know about
putting a dead snake into a bottle (B.
7/ 4/’4B), but I have seen, while out with
experienced collectors, quite a few live
ones put there. The first bloke favored
the traditional forked stick for pinning
down, but for lifting he had no less
than an ingenious pair of wooden tongs
which gripped Joe behind where his ears
ought to be and permitted him to be
guided tail-first into his crystal sarcopha-
gus. A sharp bump, along with a
slackening of the . tongs, ended the
journey, the lid being clamped on before
further argument. The other cove used
the forked stick, but, with a fine con-
tempt for other aids, picked Joe up by
the scruff of the neck, shielding his hand
with an open cotton handkerchief. This,
he reckoned, fell over the captive’s eyes,
deluding him into the idea he was in a
place of safety. Insertion into jar was by
tail first. But beware those who, taking
“Moyhu” seriously, may go, during times
of alcoholic drought, into the museum
for a sly nip out of those snake-bottles.
My collectors used formalin, and forma-
lin you’ll find in those museum bottles.
Spirit? That belonged to the age of
Darwin and Huxley.

“D.L.8.”: Glassyeyes weaved to the
weighing-machine, propped to a swaying
halt, and fumbled a penny from a pocket.
With a deal of care *he stepped on the
machine’s platform, immediately lurched
off it and took an aimless little run.
Turning about, he more or less retraced
his steps. “Hold thish,” he said, poking
an empty glass at Droopylids. With
hands free, he climbed laboriously on to
the platform and dropped his penny on
the floor. “Where’d it go?” he said,
cuddling the stem of the weighing-
machine in his arms. “Where’sh me
penniesh gorn?” Droopylids picked up
the coin in less than two minutes and, by
a determined dexterity, thrust it at the
fifth attempt into the slot. Came a
rattling from the machine’s innards and
the indicator swung uneasily about its
moon face. “Wot am I?” gasped Glassy-
eyes, clinging desperately to his anchor-
age. “Dyin’ of consumption be the
looksh of it,” said Droopylids. “Yer
on’y five The shock
of it so staggered GlasSyeyes that he
could barely make his way to the trough.

“Catspaw”: In fast ships, particularly
destroyers, I have noticed that when
rudder is applied a 32-knot destroyer
shearing through in the wake of her next
ahead, instead of heeling outwards—that
is, to starb’d if the" turn is to port —as
inertia requires, fpr a few seconds takes
on a definite inward list. Can any ex-
pert on ship movement say why?
* * * *
“Zake”: He was sitting a yard or two
out from the*river-bank up to his chest in
water. As we buttoned our overcoats
tighter, for the westerly had a chill edge
to it, the river-sitter lifted up his bare
foot, inspected the big toe, then pulled
from the pocket of the ancient coat he
wore a small bottle. “Oil of aniseed,”
he said. “Best lure o’ the lot —if y’
don’t get ’em with this you won’t get
’em with anything.” He poured a
little over his big toe, settled into his old
position, then asked “You blokes like
fishin’, too?” We denied the soft im-
peachment ; then, seeing our glance at
his own fishing gear up on the bank, he
grinned. “I’ll be startin’ shortly,” he
declared confidently. “Soon’s I get some
bait —never use anything but yabbies, an’
this”-—he underneath him
—“is the t best possie for ’em for miles! ”
* * * *
“Wipppgong”: With the turn of the
season the winged migrants are heading
north, but their departure is quieter than
their arrival, for now there is none of the
urgency that spurred the mating journey
south. Some of them still pipe up on
fine mornings, and as I write there are
among the chorus outside quite a few
calls which will not be heard a month
hence. The dismal bronze cuckoo has
wailed once or twice —he whines on his
way down, whinges all the summer even
though others do his domestic duties for
him, so it’s no surprise to hear him
grizzling his farewells —and I caught a
few notes of his pallid brother’s chromatic
scale ; unusual ' that —it’s a call little
heard after Christmas. There’s a sacred
kingfisher piping now! Thought that one
I spotted a fortnight ago was about the
last of his clan, but apparently there are
stragglers ; perhaps had a patch of easy
- going farther south and wanted to work it
right to the last minute. Peewees and
currawongs seem to be having a word to
the travellers ;-wishing them a good trip—
or maybe chiacking them for not being
able to take it; and the introduced turtle-
dove is muttering to himself in Urdu or
something. There’s the single note of a
dusky wood-swallow; he’s late, but it’s
been a good summer, and there are plenty
of insects still in the grass for him. Clear
air this morning ; Jackson’s foxy seems to
have something bailed up down the road
—hey! wait a minute. As you were.
It’s that blasted starling on the clothes-
prop again. I’ll have to shoot him in the
interests of science
UNDER WIDE SKIES.
The woman’s eyes, were sunken
And she was frail and old;
In hints and nods and whispers
the tale of life she told.
She prophesied the future
And mumbled of the past—
The saga of the gold days,
She knew it first to last.
“ ’Twas I,” she said, “who nursed you
And saw your journey start,
A puling'thing, and puny,
Born in a tilted cart.
Your bony feet were restless
And you had questing eyes
That peered far in the distance
Where the horizon lies.
“Child of the open spaces,
Yours was a class apart,
A wanderer, and rootless
With ne’er a map or chart.
Camping under heaven
In stormy nights or calm
Your destiny was written —
I read, it in your palm.
“Oh, dimly it was written
In ragged broken lines
Like tracings on the gumtrees
Or moss on cypress panes.
The wild your only lover
For you were born to roam,
With thoughts not of tomorrow,
The open road your home.
“You’d conquer plain and mountain
And sleep by many streams;
Strange places and new faces
Would haunt you in your dreams.
While others sought companions
You’d pitch your camp alone
And build in realms of fancy
A world that was your own.”
Now on my final journey,
An ancient vagabond,
I still can feel the longing
To see the land beyond. .
And could I live life over,
Born in a tilted cart,
Oh, still I’d be a rover
With ne’er a plan or chart.

JIM GRAHAME.


“Solitude”; Sandy had dropped in
with a message, and was sprawled along
his nag’s neck, yarning, when Seventy-
fiver staggered up with a large parcel.
The old bloke slid his load to the top
of a strainer-post and glared at Sandy.
“Why didn’t y’ wait an’ carry me bundle,”
he challenged, “when y’ saw I wus walk-
in’?” “I —er —but I never seen y’,V
Sandy defended. “Y’ musta. Cripes, y’
passed me just now, back down the road
a bit.” “Yair, but darn it, it’s nearly
dark,” Sandy pointed out. “Y’ don’t ex-
pect a man to have eyes like a cat, do
y’? Besides, when I come past, y’ were
just steppin’ off the log bridge near them
willers, an’ y’ know how it gets dusk
early under that scrub.” Seventyfiver
thought for a moment. “That’s right,”
he agreed, mollified. “So I was.” He re-
trieved his load. “Awright,”. he nodded.
“Just wanted to make certain y’ weren’t
tryin’ to put one over me, that’s all.”

“Hanko”: With winter’s approach,
down from the timbered hills come the
flame- and the scarlet-breasted robins,
flitting in short flights to low perch-holds,
never alighting in a tree, pressing onward
to their goal on the plairilands. A pre-
ponderant retinue of drab birds, plumaged
in light-grey with white-barred wings,
accompany the resplendent redbreasts
of both species. Next-season nestlings
most of those, and although a proportion
of them are male birds, not till their
second year will they attain the red
waistcoat and blue-black coat of adult-
hood, Feathered gems that brighten
many a dreary winter landscape, the
robins are also minor songsters of worth,
their gay, lilting melodies a delight to
the ear,

“Jemac”: Those deliberations in Mel-
bourne ag to whether Vanguard will navi-
gate the Rip recall that a warship’s
“critical speed” is found in a shallow
fairway. At certain depths a pressure-
pulse from the vast bulk of a battleship’s
forepart beats down to the sea bottom.
It is reflected, and a wave of water thrusts
back, meeting her hull near the screws.
The ship tends to slide down this sub-
marine waye, thereby increasing her
speed.
* * * *
“Macnell”; Peace-time Navy can be
entertaining, can it (B. 28 /4 / ’4B) ? Naval
sobriquets are apt, and Cocky was
precisely like his name. Ashore in
Cochin-China there is. a vicious brew, a
concoction of coconut juice, leaves of a
certain tree and a spoonful of white lime,
all reacting chemically on the tender
shoots of the sago palm. Cocky had his
fill .about the same time as the bazaar
was filled with a louder clatter than
usual. Looking down the teeming lane
we saw the hub of the hubbub was an
enormous elephant, richly caparisoned—
the Sultan’s favorite charger. Cocky was
on his feet, the lust of an unholy desire
suffusing his face. The pachyderm
sighted Cocky, something elephantine
between them established contact, and the
thing altered course and bore down upon
us. Some strange cargoes have come
inboard over that gangway, but the Sul-
k's elephant. Cocky jumping round in
front of him, placing his enormous pads
so that the weight was spread on the pier
or ship’s side, took the bun. The ship’s
company cleared lower-deck to watch.
What made it really interesting for the
onlookers was the fact that everybody
but Cocky and us knew that the Sultan
was being entertained in the wardroom
below. I believe the Sultan was speaking
of his elephant when it happened, and
“Y’re aimin' in the Wrong direction , Mick!”
the Old Man asked Pilot to jump up top
and find out if we were embarking oil-
drums or ammunition. Then a splinter-
ing crash and a shower of glass filled
the wardroom. I doubt if the Sultan
had seen the roadside of his elephant’s
foot before, but he was seeing it now —
a huge calloused lump of flesh ravined
like the surface of the moon protruding
through the skylight. A destroyer’s
quarterdeck has its limits, and Cocky’s
pet had found one of them. It has been
said that a ship is like a farm —there is
always work to be done. For the next
14 days Cocky and his “friends” did
the ruddy lot.

“Dronestung”: As insulation against
frost I recommend newspaper blankets to
those who sleep in parks and amateur
gardeners nursing early tomato plants.
Have used them in beehives satisfactorily
over a few seasons, but went astray
some weeks back when bedding-down
bee colonies for winter. I didn’t bar-
gain for a long spell of warm, dry weather
to follow and a strong honey-flow from
late-flowering stringybarks. The bees
gnawed out the paper and stacked it in
heaps of confetti in front of the landing-
boards, filling-in the spaces between frames
and covers with wedges of honeycomb.
Apparently A pis had to moisten the news-
paper for easier chewing, for the edges
were soft and greenish-yellow as If
wetted with saliva. If cold conditions had
set in when expected that paper would
have stayed intact till spring activity war-
ranted its removal.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”; He was old,
whiskery and a battler, and he insinu-
ated himself into the conversation and
each round of drinks in a way that
brought tolerant winks and grins from
the bar-room company. He explained
diffidently that he couldn’t stomach beer
—he was just down from the north and
“Polly Wants a cup o’ tea —Polly wants a cup o' tea —Polly. .."
gin was his only food. So each round
carried a gin. Towards closing-time Bill
the Goose, always the chief shouter at
such sessions, introduced a little comedy
into the proceedings by holding a lighted
match in his mouth, a feat which some
of the younger members hastened to
emulate. The oldster’s eyes twinkled.
“Just 4 sec.,” be said. “I’ll show y’ a
trick worth two of that.” He pranced
across to the barman, who grinned and
produced a bottle of methylated spirits.
The old-timer filled his mouth from the
bottle, held a lighted match about a foot
from his face and blew a steady, thin
stream of metho. on to the flame. The
company watched in amazement as the
metho. ignited, and were preparing to
applaud when the old chap’s breath gave
out. He drew back for a fresh start, and
the flame followed to his gin-sodden
whiskers. Rough hands quickly smothered
the fire, and they sat him on a form and
plied him with gin and ointment. His
face was raw and blistered and he hadn’t
a hair left oh his head, but his sort are
game. He twisted his cracked lips into a
grin and said “That was a trick for a
clean-shaven man.”

“Bo”: Jordan came past just as Mc-
Cracken turned at the headland. “Cripes,
Mac, y’ got Jenny in the plough already
—why, she on’y foaled two days ago,
didn’t she?” Mac nodded. “Aye,” he
said. “But what can I do? The mare’s
the only one I’ve got for the job.” Jordan
protested that it wasn’t right, and pro-
mised to send a spare horse over the
next morning to see him through. Just
on dark the next afternoon Mac took
the borrowed horse back. “Did he go
all right?” asked Jordan. Mac screwed
his face up, and thought a second or two.
“Aye, not sae bad,” he said at last. “But
not sae guid as I thought he’d be. Per-
haps,” he added, “it’s because he doesn’t
like wor-r-kin’ alongside a mare, think
y’?”
* * * *
“Trade Wind”; Infinite pains go to
the making of a survey sloop’s charts
(B, 7/4/’4B). On board all data from
sounding boats are correlated in the plot-
ting-room. Brilliantly lit, it contains a
large table on which each officer marks
his own soundings, obtained after months
of gruelling work under a tropic sun
from daylight to dark. These are first
inked on to specially-prepared cartridge-
paper which is so sensitive to heat that
lights overhead could stretch it, and it is
kept out only a limited time. A contrac-
tion of one-eighth of an inch on a chart
could put a navigator out 100 yards on
a harbor —and on to a reef. When the
rough copy is finished, with its thou-
sands of lines of figures, each represent-
ing a sounding in fathoms, it is trans-
ferred to a linen sheet. This, previously
waxed for preserving, is boiled and ironed
again before use. Now the shiny cloth
begins to look like a chart. Surveying
officers are beautiful penmen, and reefs,
bays, capes, trees and tide-rips are inked
in with a copperplate touch. Then come
the colors ; a reef shows burnt sienna ;
mangroves, green; rocky ledges, raw
sienna; sand, yellow; and the beach,
black. Thus the cartographers in Syd-
ney know what a coral lagoon looks like
above and below water. When all the
officers’ linen sheets are completed they
are transferred to a “collector,” a com-
prehensive chart of the same material
covering the whole area surveyed. Four
feet wide, light affects it also, and when
finished it is stowed in a specially-dried
drawer. Sent to Sydney, cartographers
select the most suitable soundings, leav-
ing space to run a ship’s course and posi-
tion, and the chart is published. You
can buy it for a couple of bob,
* * * *
“Conda”: I agree with “Bosun’s Mate”
(B. 28/4/’4B) that copper sheathing offers
little protection against the teredo. I
have seen a surveying sloop’s copper-
bottomed boats holed like a Swiss cheese
by the borers. The teredo, a long worm-
like body, fastens itself to the boat with
one round sucker of a foot. Inside its
mouth are two sets of fine ridges which
are seen under a microscope as minute
teeth, like a file. These are given a rock-
ing motion by muscular contraction, and
the copper, then wood, is rasped away
as a fine dust. The wood, passing into
the worm’s stomach, is acted on by diges-
tive juices and forms its main food.
Though usually less than a foot long,
some worms in tropical waters reach 6ft,

“Old-timer”: The hands were in Eus-
ton one Saturday, and by nightfall every-
body was full of beer and cheer and
goodfellowship except Pocketknife,
who’d been seduced from his staple
liquor into sampling some of George
Medley’s best whisky. Pocketknife
passed rapidly from elation to morose-
ness and then a desire to destroy some-
body, and by dark he’d become such a
nuisance that a somewhat inebriated con-
ference- decided to deal with him. So
Pocketknife was recharged with a couple
of double-headers, and, when comktose,
was lugged outside and made comfort-
able in the station utility, which hap-
pened to be parked alongside the one
from Tolpra Plains. Having covered
Pocketknife up we resumed the business
of the evening. Somewhere about 1 a.m.
we poured Little Curl into the driving
seat and ourselves into the cabin and
body of the truck, and L.C. headed for
Prill, everybody singing. The singing
stopped at Prill because Pocketknife had
been jolted out somewhere along the five
miles. Big Fleming had a vague memory
of somebody falling out, so we turned
and went back. P. was missing, but we
spotted a hat, searched for a while round
it, then went back to town and reported
to the trooper. Volunteers were pulled
out and the search was resumed. It
went on until daylight, and may have still
been going only that the boss drove out
about 8 a.m. to say that Tolpra Plains
had rung to ask what the devil the Prill
truck, with one Prill hand aboard, was
doing in Tolpra homestead yard.

“Billy T.”: Well, “B. A. Ker” (B.
21/4/’4B), so far as I’m concerned, the
answer’s simple —I don’t know. Can’t
find any fitting analogies—when ducklings
are hatched by a hen do they cackle or
quack? When little Japs grow up in
California, how do they speak? Did
Romulus and Remus howl like ordinary
kids or like wolves? Never having kept
wild fowl shut up, I’m completely igno-
rant of their problematical reaction to
hypothetical environment; but Ido know
that if I were caged I would probably
be stricken dumb, too.
* * * *
“E. 2”: She was a disreputable,
battered, oil-grimed hulk of machinery
on four wheels, so old her make
was long forgotten, and someone
had titled her “Fanny,” a name that
stuck. The mechanic was a dapper little
fellow with a cocksure grin. Alec took
him over to the tractor and listened
vacantly to a long commentary on the
infirmities of the thing. That mechanic
grinned broadly at the derelict and went
to work with scientific pleasure. Alec
gaped at him, eyes bulging with envy at
the trim array of spanners in his kit.
About two hours later the mechanic was
satisfied and beckoned to Alec. “Give her
a swing, will y’?” he asked. Alec backed
away a couple of paces. “Swing her
y’rself,” he retorted. The mechanic eyed
him with a puzzled look. “Y’ can’t get
y’r arm or wrist broke if y’ hold it this
way,” he demonstrated, and swung the
handle. She gave a gentle cough, a
couple of rumbling groans and started
purring like a kitten. “Ticks over like
a good ’un,” said the mechanic. He let
her run for a while, making a couple of
minor adjustments. Then he switched
off the ignition. “She oughta start easy
now,” he said, grabbed the handle and
swung. Bang! The ruin backfired ex-
plosively and fiercely snorted a column
of blue smoke. The mechanic writhed
on the ground in agony with a broken
arm. No one ever tried again to start
Fanny on the handle; thereafter she was
launched on the downhill run from the
rise at the haystacks.
CAFE BELLADONNA.
Ah, the Gate Belladonna,
Where the poets all got “sprung”;
Where we called the good wine “vino”;
Where the foreign songs were sung.
Aye, the Caf£ Belladonna,
Where the artists were all sighs
As they gazed at Mona Lisa
With her dark and sleepy eyes:
Mona Lisa, live and living,
With no enigmatic smile,
At the Caf6 Belladonna
Of the old Bohemian style;
With the vino red as roses,
And all tongues set for a tale,
And the lovely Mona Lisa,
Called “The Vino Nightingale.”
In the back room heavy laden
With the smoke from smiling lips
Mona Lisa softly singing,
Sleepy-eyed and round of hips;
With the brave and restless poets
And the artists-yet-to-be,
Holding up their glowing vino
Like a jewel bright to see.
“Come on, Beppo, fill the glasses!
Never mind how much we owe,
We will pay you, good old Beppo,
In a hundred years or so;
We will drink to you, good Beppo,
And to Mona Lisa, too,
And the Caf6 Belladonna,
As all good Bohemians do.”
Round the hazy old piano,
Unkempt “genius” at the keys,
With our ninepence in our pocket
And our dreams and threadbare knees;
With the “famous” poets dreaming,
And the “artists” yet to rise,
At the Cafd Belladonna
Of the Mona Lisa eyes.
Yes, the Cafe Belladonna,
And dark Mona Lisa’s eyes,
And good Beppo and his vino,
In the days when we were “wise,”
When we knew, aye, all the answers,
And we had no time to think:
When we called the red wine “vino”
That the Philistines called “ink.”

"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO GRAZCOS."
Foolrot in Sheep.
“Mr.”: Examine their feet in
the dry months and isolate all
showing old infection or surface
inflammation between the digits.
The trouble can be controlled
more easily at this time of year,
as the percentage of affected
sheep is smaller than during wet
months. Pare all misshapen
hooves and isolate any sheep
with lesions on the feet; they
are possible carriers of the germ.
(The footrot organism can’t live
apart from sheep or cattle for
long, though it may live for
years in the hooves of carriers.)
If all the affected sheep are
put through a 10 per cent, foot-
bath every two or three days the
trouble will soon clear up. Any
stubbdrn cases should be re-
garded as chronic and sent to the
butcher. Even if they did respond
to treatment eventually the time
taken to effect a cure could be
put to better use. Two or three
weeks after the last case has
cleared up the soil should be
free of infective organisms, and
no further trouble is likely un-
less , the germ is reintroduced.
Careful examination of all new-
comers and isolation of sufferers
and suspects for treatment will
keep the property clean.
Mastitis.
“Sulfa”: If the total of the
irreparable damage it does were
fully realised dairymen would
concentrate more thoroughly on
prevention. Men will pay good
prices for cows and bulls of
high-production strains and do
nothing to prevent a disease that
will nullify all the skill of the
breeder.
Mastitis germs may be pre-
sent but dormant until an injury
to the udder sets them going.
Prevention lies in handling
stock quietly, keeping yards and
bails clean and insisting on
cleanliness and the disinfecting
of hands, udders and bails. Best
are the chlorine disinfectants —
sodium hypochlorite is the liquid
form, but it is cheaper to buy
the powder, and make it up as
required. It doesn’t taint milk-
ing machines and utensils.
There is no 100 p.c. cure.
Some alleged cures do as much
harm as the disease itself. Best
remedy is penicillin, which can
be obtained only on a vet.’s pre-
scription. But penicillin is effi-
cient only where the strepto-
coccus-germ is responsible—it is
useless against staphylococcus
and certain other organisms.
Symptoms appear first in the
milk, which shows small clots.
Later one or more quarters of
the udder become hot and swol-
len. The sooner treatment is
begun the better the chances of
cure, along with least damage
to the cow’s future production.
Only bacteriological examination
of the milk will identify the
germ and indicate the treatment.
Sample bottles and stoppers
should be boiled for 10 minutes
and allowed to cool before fill-
ing. Samples must be kept as
cold as possible and sent to the
laboratory at once.
Penicillin, a powder, must be
fresh and kept cool. Each con-
tainer is sufficient for three treat-
ments of one quarter, used
strictly according to directions.
Whether syringe or bottle is used
to administer they should be
thoroughly sterilised before and
after use, and teat-syphons or
milk-needles must not be used
for more than one teat before
being sterilised again. Penicillin
will shortly be available in
pliable tubes with teat-syphon
attached. Each tube will con-
tain sufficient for one applica-
tion, after which it should be
destroyed. The contents should
be injected into the quarter after
it has been milked out and
allowed to remain until next
milking. Infected cows should
be milked last. A bacterio-
logical test of milk samples from
every cow in the herd is a good
idea. Although penicillin cures
most cases it won’t give indefi-
nite protection. The cow may
get a fresh infection within a
short time if conditions be
favorable. Aim always at pre-
vention.
Honey and Bees-wax.
“Bumble”: Garden honey as
sold is usually the high-class
article gathered from our best
eucalypts ; that from berry crops
runs it fairly close in quality.
Whether it pays to specialise in
producing and marketing a pro-
portion of the crop as extra-
prime depends on whether the
rest can be marketed profitably
without the need for blending to
improve its quality. The art of
blending should be practised first
in small quantities, for it takes
a skilled hand to prepare a
highly acceptable blend from
assorted honeys. Strong-
flavored honey like that from
pennyroyal could taint a whole
crop, so it may prove wise to
keep doubtful flavors out of the
blending-tank.
Some apiarists, having flows of
good average quality through
the season, market the crop as it
comes in ; others prefer to strike
a popular blend and self to indi-
vidual customers, sometimes
having as well a “garden” or
extra-choice lot at a better price.
Whichever method is adopted
depends on the honey’s general
quality and the business acumen
of the beekeeper.
A wax-press is essential where
any quantity of bees-wax is
produced, as other means of
separating the pure wax from
the matrix aren’t likely to obtain
more than a moderate percent-
age. Use plenty of boiling water
in the process, having the press
thoroughly heated before each
batch is squeezed out. Alkaline
substances in the solution dis-
integrate beds-wax, so the water
should be acid to counteract
them, being made so with a
small quantity of sulphuric acid.
Run the molten wax into
moulds of 12 or 15 pounds for
convenience ; allowing it to cool
very slowly in water —12 to 24
hours —produces the best finish,
free from cracks and diffusion
of rubbish particles.
Schooling the Colt.
“Wirrameju”: Having ridden
the colt, the real work of break-
ing him in is ready to begin. If
your groundwork has been good
it will be smooth, as the colt’s
brain, unhampered by any fears
or lack of confidence, is recep-
“I always get travel-sick if I don't face the engine.”
tive, and he will be even eager
to co-operate with you in learn-
ing new lessons. If your colt is
an all-purpose farm hack there
are some elementary things he
must now learn. Firstly, to
stand quietly “tied to the
ground” with his reins dragging ;
secondly, to turn properly when
working cattle and to work with
correct leg leading ; thirdly, to
canter from the walk.
To teach him to stand with
reins dropped, get a half-dozen
iron pegs the tops of which are
shaped in a “ram’s horn.” They
should be long and strong and
driven in so that it is wellnigh
impossible to a pulling horse to
shift them. Drive them in at
odd places round the farm or, at
any rate, over an area of a hun-
dred acres. Attach extra-strong
reins to the bridle and be sure
your bridle is in faultless order.
Ride the colt up to one of these
pegs, dismount and drop the
reins over the hook. As
soon as he has accepted the
fact that he is anchored by the
reins pick up the reins, mount
and ride to another peg. Repeat
the procedure at each peg,
giving him a little longer at
each.
Do this a little every day. Don’t
form a routine in which you
start always at the same peg and
proceed always to the same
second peg, etc. Just go to any
peg; and those pegs must be
well down to create the illusion
of being tied to the ground. I
also put one or two pegs in each
paddock and shift them about
frequently. It might take any
time from a day to a month for
your colt to learn this lesson,
but only when he will stand for
a half-hour or more without test-
ing the peg is it safe to ride him
near the peg and drop the reins.
The distance can be gradually
increased (although a return to
a peg now and then is advisable
until the colt has been in school
for a year) until yoq can safely
drop your reins anywhere.
Meanwhile, if it becomes neces-
sary to leave him standing in a
paddock, drop one rein and tie
the other firmly to either his
near fore-pastern or his near-
stirrup —so that he either can’t
lift his head to run or he can
move only in a circle.
To teach him his turns place
a row of six or eight long sticks
in the ground about eight yards
apart. Weave him in and out
through these, first at a walk and
later at a trot, always insisting
that he change direction on his
outside leg (i.e., the off-fore when
turning left; the near-fore to
the right). When he has mas-
tered this without rein-control
do it at the canter, and you will
find that changing step in his
turns will come to him naturally.
Then institute a figure-eight as
for camp-drafts. With this train-
ing and a natural inclination to
work stock you should have the
makings of a good, sure-footed
cattle-horse.
The hardest part of colt-
breaking has begun. For the
next year you cannot afford to
relax for a moment when riding
him. Make him do whatever
you want. If it is a walk, make
him walk briskly with his head
up ; if a trot, make him swing
along freely; if a canter, make
him go comfortably with his
head up and light on his fore-
hand. Unlatch your gates and
make him push them open.
Carry livestock on him and
make him go smoothly. Make
him pick up his feet for your
hoof inspection, open his mouth
for his dental inspections, stand
spread for you to mount 6nd
stand still and alert when not in
action. Make yourself a hard
but understanding taskmaster
and you are building up a
mutual respect and admiration in
which you, not the colt, will
profit most.
Underwater Concrete.
“Kurilla”: Just had occasion
to use concrete in the bottom of
a well, apd found I would have
saved bother if I had (a) tried a
sample of the mix in a bucket
of water from the well before-
hand, ( b ) used nothing but the
best of clean, sharp sand, (c)
doubled the amount of cement
ordinarily used to the usual
amount of sand and perhaps
used a bit more metal than
ordinarily. Cement is hydraulic.
Slow setting under water is ideal,
and it sets very hard ultimately,
but may take a fortnight or
longer to thoroughly harden in
some waters. Sand, unless
washed, carries fragments of
roots, clay,. etc., which will de-
lay setting.
If there is running water you
can stop the concrete from
being washed out by bagging it
and dropping the bags into the
forms. A few months sees the
sacking entirely rotted away and
the job as solid as if poured.
Work the bags well into place.
Don’t start the pump until sure
that the concrete is set.
Rotational Grazing.
“Vacherie”; The principles
of subdivision and rotational
grazing are well known, but it
is not always easy to plan the
details in order to ensure that

stock get ample grazing at its
most nutritious stage and that
swards are maintained. The
first thing to determine is the
total area required by each
beast, including milkers, dry
cows and young stock over nine
months of age. The second is
the, rate of stocking of the sub-
divisions during grazing. Sup-
pose that one acre per beast is
allowed in the total area of the
farm, and six or seven cows per
acre is selected as the rate for
grazing, then for 50 cows, 50
acres would be necessary, divided
into seven or eight acres each,
and six or seven paddocks would
be available for pasture im-
provement and rotational graz-
ing. .
Hints for the Farm.
-‘Big Billy”: A cheap and
easy method of maintaining egg
quality during warm weather is
to store them in a Coolgardie
safe as soon as they are col-
lected. This storage provides an
ideal combination of cool air
with a total absence of draughts,
“F.L.”: Silver-wattles thrive
on new clearings where the
initial grubbing and burning-off
causes patches of seeds to ger-
minate and roots of cut-down
trees to sucker. They present a
problem if in groves of young
trees, as cutting and burning
merely checks them for a time.
An easy way of clearing is by
using a pair of horses with drag-
chain and bar in the winter
when the ground is soaked. One
man drives the team while the
other operates the bar; it is
fastened near one end to the
chain and locked quickly around
a tree while the horses are mov-
ing, pulling clear as each is
dragged out. The method is
speedy, tears out long roots
cleanly and there is little further
growth.
“Kalo”: Turkeys on free
range need a mash meal at night
if large insects such as grass-
hoppers, crickets and beetles are
plentiful. The meal coats the
hard parts of the insects, which
might otherwise cause injury.
“Sarjna”: When installing a
wireless-set in wet districts, make
sure it is not placed with its
back to an outer wall against
which rain drives. Dampness
works in from the constantly-
saturated spot and is likely to
injure the receiver. A constant
spluttering or dull roaring noise
in the set during rainy weather
is a sure sign that damp is
affecting the coils, and a break-
down is certain unless something
is done about it. Keeping a
lighted lantern behind the set
will dry out the moisture tem-
porarily, but the wet battery
should be taken away during the
time the light is there.
“B. Acre”: An electric fence
can cause inconvenience. A
neighbor had one to keep a boar
in check. When it came to
shifting the boar it was found
necessary to remove the fence,
posts and all, to get him out
of the yard,
“Dibdin”: A leaking radiator,
particularly if the leak is at the
bottom of the cells where it can’t
be got at with the soldering-
iron, can be stopped with pitch.
Melt the pitch, work into it some
cottonwool, teased-out cotton-
waste or rag as a binder. Cool
it to a plastic state, then press
firmly into the leaking area.
Make sure the area is dry—a
slight warm-up with the blow-
lamp makes an even better job.
Allow pitch to set firmly before
starting engine. If pitch is short
on the farm sufficient may be
obtained from worn-out dry
batteries.

STOP WEARING
GLASSES
Whatever your age, however long you have
worn glasses, or your eyes have troubled
you, Eye Culture can help yoij. Short
sight—long sight—old-age sight—turned,
tired or strained eyes—glare—headaches
—in fact, almost any eye trouble or dis-
comfort can be remedied by Eye Culture.
NO APPLIANCES, EYE DKOPS
OB DKUGS.
Just a simple course of Eye Culture,
which removes congestion from the tissues
and strengthens strained, weakened eye
muscles. This means that soon —usually
from two to six weeks —the eyes com-
mence to improve and glasses become un-
necessary as the eyes gradually regain
their lost vitality and strength.
Eye Culture is more than just eye exer-
cises—it is a treatment based on the
training of the eyes in relation to the
whole system. It is hacked by over 16
years’ practice in Australia, and is based
upon commonsense laws of nature. Glasses
weaken the eyes—Eye Culture strengthens
them. Isn’t that what you want?
If you cannot call for a consultation, which
is free, send a stamped addressed

sight Without Glasses,”' to

Nasty to Take.
“B.M.A. secretary Dr. J. G. Hunter
said in Sydney he believed the Federal
Government had issued a limited
formulary of free medicines so as
to restrict the costs of the free-
medicine scheme.”
The general office of the Act-
ing Temporary Deputy-Assistant
Administrator of Socialised
Pharmaceutical Services (Gratis)
was a veritable hive, if not ex-
actly of industry, at least one in
which the familiar drones were
flitting about aimlessly, carrying
files of papers.
Things had augured well for
the new department, for by
carrying only 15 deadheads—
all of them either defeated
“Labor” members or former
Communist union officials
beaten in ballots —on upwards
of £lOOO p.a. and limiting
chemist-shop inspectors and the
staff who had to inspect the in-
spectors to around 700, it was
hoped to keep the costs of the
scheme to no more than
£400,000 in excess of the esti-
mates.
Around the walls in their
heavy gilt frames were slogans
such as “Remember, every trey-
bit counts! ” “Why have haema-
turia when you can enjoy a
simple colic?” “A pennyworth
of pills is better than a penny-
weight of penicillin.” “We treat
you, but only to the cheapest.”
“Ben may give you a pain in
the neck, but he cures it for
nothing! ” “Be patriotic! Don’t
insist on mist. pot. cit. for hob-
nailed kidneys when Glauber’s is
available.”
The sick-looking man who
had been waiting half an hour
for attention at last managed to
catch the eye of a clerk, one of
a group which had just finished
a lengthy discussion on dog
form. The clerk immediately
glanced at a printed instruction
on the counter and launched
into his ritual.
“Fill in a form first,” he
barked. “Blue form 12A for
head pains, green form 37C for
all coughs and colds except those
in throat or head, in which case
use form 12A; white form 19F
for all gut complaints; pink
form 22D fox pains in the limbs,
all skin troubles including
pimples, sunburn, warts, moles,
surfer’s foot and carbuncles, but
not including boils —they’re on
special form 3AA. If you throw

suffering from ingrowing hairs,

deficiencies, Barcoo rot, St. Vitus’

the knee or brain, housemaid’s
knee, croup, roup or the staggers
you’re unlucky—the Parliamen-
tary draftsman overlooked
them, and you’ll have to wait till
they amend the bill next ses-
sion.”
“But I”
“Quiet, please. Remember,
you’re getting this free. With
every form you fill in you have
to submit an affidavit signed by a
J.P. and two independent wit-
nesses who are not relatives to
say that you didn’t catch the
complaint or develop the pains
deliberately with a view to avail-
ing yourself of free medicine.
Also, you must fill in another
form giving the full names, ages
and addresses of all those with
whom you were in direct contact
within the 24 hours previous to
your developing the complaint if
it is catching—this refers specifi-
cally to coughs, colds, measles,
mumps, whooping-cough and
leprosy —full details of color of
grandparents’ hair on both sides
—that is, sides of the family, not
the head —if any aunts, nieces or

for the same complaint, giving
full details ; whether you are a
fully-financial unionist, if your
employer walks with a limp, a
list of the domestic pets you
keep, whether you shave left-
handed (male only), if you are
able to put your arm around the
back of your neck and touch
your chin with all your five
fingers, and give size of neck-
band, boots and waist when the
breath is fully exhaled. Should
you”
“I was here two days ago,”
put in the sick-looking man at
last. “I filled in four lots of
forms and got the affidavits all
signed, but they said they were
out of order. I had pains all
over me, and” ——
“Well, what else did you ex-
pect?” demanded the clerk.
“There’s no provision under the
regulations for having pains all
over. You have to decide where
the pain is worst and fill in the
particular form covering that
part. Where’s your pain now?”
“Well, I’ve got a headache
and”
“Mist. A.P.C.,” droned the
clerk. “Fill in the form and
affidavits and leave it here for
approval, counter-signature by
the Chief Clerk and the making-
out of the authority to the
chemist—it won’t be ready till
the day after tomorrow. You
can”
“But the main pain is in my
stomach! ”
“Well, why didn’t you say so
at first? You only have a choice
between castor-oil and black-
jack for any stomach ailment.”
“But my doc. says I’ve a crook
appendix, and I’ve heard oil
might cause it to burst”
The clerk looked at the suppli-
cant for bounty sternly. “Listen,”
he said, “you’ll take what we
say, and go by the regulations.
If your appendix bursts on you
that’s your affair. By your
arrogant attitude anyone would
think you were paying for the
stuff. Now, do you want to fill
the form in, or don’t you?”

ing and purporting to give an account of
the war against the Japanese, I am
puzzled by the consistent, manner in
which every writer, service-leader and
critic has overlooked the existence —let
alone the efforts—of 453 Squadron, which
served in Malaya and Singapore.
The squadron, with the exception of
the C. 0., the engineering officer and a
handful of R.A.F. wireless mechanics and
maintenance men, was entirely R.A.A.F.
In B. 17/3/’4B “Waddlin’ Willie”
stated that Mr. Drakeford was apparently
ignorant of the early air-War against the
Japanese. I wholeheartedly agree with
him. If a squadron which is composed of
95 per cent. R.A.A.F, can serve in a
campaign for its full length, be credited
with 26 confirmed victories and 19 prob-
ables for the loss of four pilots killed in
action, and be the last Australian
squadron to serve on Singapore Island be-
fore the surrender, and then be com-
pletely ignored by its own Air Minister
and Minister for Information, there must
he something wrong somewhere.
No. 453 Squadron was one of the “In-
filtration” squadrons, first formed early
in 1941. The unit, the last of the
R.A.A.F. units to arrive at Singapore,
reached there towards the end of August,
1941, and left there on the morning of
February 7, 1942, finally reaching Adel-
aide on March 15 by way of Java and
Colombo. The unit was then disbanded
and its pilots and ground-crews sent to
other squadrons. Later in England the
squadron was re-formed, served in
the Battle for Germany and formed part
of the British Occupation forces.
It was 453 which received the urgent
order to go out and assist the Prince of
Wales and Repulse when they were
attacked by Jap aircraft on December 10,
and which “reached the scene in com-
mendably quick time, but only to see the
two ships go down,” In its first engage-
ment against the Jap, seven of its pilots
flying Brewster Buffaloes shot down five
Jap bombers and fighters without loss.
That was on December 13, at Butter-
worth.
On December 22, at Kuala Lumpur, the
squadron was credited with seven con-
firmed and a number of probables as
against three of the squadron’s pilots
killed. The odds in this engagement were
three to one against the squadrofa’s
fighters, and, again quoting the official
report, “at Kuala Lumpur the position
improved when our fighters engaged
enemy aircraft with good results.”
No. 453 was the only fighter unit to use
the ’drome at Kuala Lumpur.
Every call made upon the unit’s pilots
was met with the limited means at their
disposal. During the campaign 40 air-
craft were lost in combat, destroyed on
the ground and in accidents. Greatest
losses were due to enemy bombing, and
towards the end of the campaign the
squadron had only three serviceable
machines. In an effort to match the Jap-
anese Zero, the .squadron used “cut-
down” Brewsters, All external equip-
ment was discarded, the wireless-mast
cut off, only gear considered absolutely
essential left, petrol capacity reduced and
ammunition limited.
When No. 8 and No. 1 Squadrons
(L ock h e e d-Hudsons) and No. 21
Squadron (Brewster Buffaloes) were with-
drawn to Java towards the end of Janu-
ary, 1942, 453 was the only full Australian
squadron left on the island, and con-
tinued to co-operate with a mixed force
of R.A.F. Hurricanes and Blenheims
until it was ordered to Java on February
6- During the last two days on the
island the squadron, operating from Sem-
bawang aerodrome adjoining and slightly
behind the naval base, was subject to
almost continuous shellfire from Jap-
anese artillery on the hills overlooking
the Straits of Johore. With their own 25-
pounders behind the ’drome, the
squadron actually operated aircraft from
a sort of no-man’s-land while the Jap-
anese and British artillery engaged each
other. ~
The squadron shared all the misfor-
tunes of the sorry campaign with every
Air Force unit stationed there, and while
saluting those gallant men who flew the
old 85-m.p.h. Yildebeeste and Swordfish
“stringbags,” and the courage and ability
of all the Hudson and Blenheim boys, 1
do feel that the deeds of No. 453
Squadron have never been worthily recog-
nised.
The pilots were superb. With the ex-
ception of the C.O. (an R.A.F. man)
and the two fight-commanders, all the
other pilots were seeing action for the
first time. They learned their lessons
the hard way, and the proof of their
ability as flyers lies in the figures of 26
Japanese confirmed for the loss of only
four pilots in action. Their courage was
of the highest order, and was one thing
the Japanese could not claim to have as
a monopoly.
No decorations were awarded to these
pilots, although they won them over
and over again, and while that point is
one on which we members of the ground-
staff have strong feelings even if the
pilots never Would complain, we can only
surmise that the Ministers for Air and
Information have not been fully informed
on the part that Australia played in the
early air-war against Japan. I hope that
this position will be rectified when the
Official Australian War History is being
recorded. — Sembawang (Vic.).
Papua-N.G. Capital
“Mac Ale” (B. 24/3/’4B) says it must-
be in the highlands, claiming that a
capital there would become “the health
resort and playground for the Terri-
tories.” From my own observations too
“Let’s call a truce , gentlemen—Well he Waking
the neighborhood
much attention is already given to the
playground and not enough to adminis-
trating.
Admitted the climate of Port Moresby
is not the best, but neither is the climate
of many centres on the Australian main-
land. That has already been taken into
account by the authorities, who have laid
down working hours as from 8 a.m. to
4 p.m. with an hour-and-a-half break for
lunch, and with breaks for morning and
afternoon teas.
Unless Moresby has changed consider-
ably since I left it, many of the adminis-
trative staff can be seen in working hours
doing the family shopping or enjoying a
drink in one of the town’s two hotels.
Any move to the highlands could not
make the capital more of a playground
than it is at the moment, despite the nor’-
west monsoon and the shortage of beer.
Therte is need for a week-end place for
residents, but a commercial interest might
make a better job of that. The capital
should be left where it can best govern.—
Momokan (Q.).
Orators
I have heard all the orators in Federal
politics since Federation. In my teens
I heard Alfred Deakin, “the silvery-
tongued orator,” at his best. That was
at Ballarat, then no mean city in itself as
regards this noble gift. Very appropri-
ate, too, seeing that it is the home of the
South-street Eisteddfod, so notably spon-
sored by Billy Hill and a worthy band
of stalwarts.
One of them was Jimmy Scullin. In
my youth he kept a tiny grocer’s-shop in
Skipton-street, but in politics he was born
to the purple. Small in stature, J.S. held
immense crowds in Sturt-street and at the
Alfred Hall enthralled by his superb
oratory. This was before the mike and
the amplifier swam into our ken.
’ln my middle years I paid humble
tribute to W. A. Watt, who was of a
more rugged type, but a man of deep
parts. Many a time I’ve heard him sway
a roaring, hostile meeting to silence, admi-
ration and final tumultuous applause.
So down the years it has been my
privilege and pleasure to hear and study
the giants of oratory, who have sought
and attained the highest places in our
political life. I have also had and
cherished their personal acquaintance.
Now, in my maturer years, I still claim
that honor in respect of one who is the
daddy of the lot. Though I differ from
him in his political views, there is one
amongst us who attains to the highest
flights, and who can charm an opposing
audience with the same power as Billy
Watt. He has all the grace of a Deakin,
and all the adroit, purposeful persuasive-
ness of a Scullin. He is Robert G.
Menzies. —P. O’B. (Vic.),
Soldiers
“Waddlin’ Willie” (B. 14/4/’4B) main-
tains that “campaigns made soldiers,”
and that “the bullring was all right in its
place.” Has he ever watched a battery
of 3.7 s in action, the gunners getting
away their 12 rounds per minute with
accuracy? Has he ever watched the in-
strument crews bending over their instru-
ments, or the radar-operators peering
on to the cathode tubes? I have, many
times, and I never noticed any men who
were “cunning” or “trusted nobody.”
Any predictor-operator or height-taker
could teach “W.W.” plenty about being
“keen” and “sharp-eyed.”
1 heard our colonel remark “If we can
train men to do the little
things, when the time
comes they’ll do the big
things.” He should have
known —while in Crete his
regiment destroyed over
100 German aircraft in 12
hours, and then got out by
the skin of its teeth.
The soldier of today is
not a legendary figure de-
pending upon his ability
to stalk, stab or battle his
way singlehanded when-
ever he sees fit. He is a
highly - trained specialist,
and if he doesn’t get his
knowledge from the bull-
ring, then I don’t know
where he will get it. If he
is taught to keep his blan-
ket in three folds and his
kit square, then in nine
cases out of 10 he can be
depended upon to make
use of his training, and do
what is expected of him.
The finest examples of
training and discipline are
to be found in the records
of the British Navy. Does
“W.W.” believe that
H.M.A.S. Yarra would
have acquitted herself bet-
ter if she had been manned
by seasoned veterans?
Does he know of the mag-
nificent defence of the
A.I.F. and militia when
Rab a u 1 was attacked
during the early weeks of the Pacific war?
Were these men veterans?
For all the decorated “bad-parade
soldiers” that “W.W.” mentions, he
should remember the many thousands
of men who took their training and dis-
cipline seriously. We wouldn’t be where
we are today if they hadn’t. — Vacco (Q.).
Price-control
After much expensive litigation the
South Australian Government recently
“took over” from private enterprise the
job of supplying Adelaide and suburbs
with electricity, the idea being to ensure
greater efficiency and reduced tariffs.
The difference between the socialistic
ideal and the harsh reality is briefly but
eloquently expressed in a circular de-
livered this week to all consumers:
Owing to the recent heavy increase in the
cost of N.S.W. coal, the increase in
marginal differences in pay, and the intro-
duction of the 40-hour week, together with
increases in the prices of practically all
materials used in its business, the trust
has found it necessary to increase its tariffs.
That is an admission from a purely
socialist source that prices are “con-
trolled” by the law of supply and demand,
and that high wages, combined with low
production, inevitably result in dear com-
modities and services. A few months ago
the increase would have been attributed
to the rapacity of sweating, slave-driving,
rack-renting money-barons. Spiral
(S.A.).
The Swagman
Touching the Desert Corps plan for a
memorial to its horses, what’s wrong
with a life-size or larger statue right in
the heart of Sydney to the old-time swag-
man, who contributed so much to estab-
lishing the pastoral industry?
He had to be game to shoulder the
knot and walk out of a capital city or
a comfortable country town, or even a
poverty-stricken farm in the closer-settle-
ment areas, and make for the outback to
raise the rent while his family waited for
word of his progress. Vast areas were
fenced and cleared by him, thousands
of woolsheds and other buildings, includ-
ing comfortable homesteads, rose under
his sweat-drops, and in the days before
petrol-machines millions of sheep gave
up their wealth to his blades.
As a class he was a toiler first and a
nomad second by necessity, but Australia
today is dotted with farms he founded or
developed on his earnings on the track.
He is gone, with his huge “bluey,” his
nosebag, his billy and waterbag, from the
dry tracks back o’ beyond. But his
memory lingers, and we owe him a debt
bigger than the 1948 social-services
budget.—Greenhide Bob (N.S.W.).
“The Trade Store”
That interesting New Guinea institu-
tion, the native trade store, still flourishes,
and the new-era establishment differs little
from the pre-war model. In construc-
tion, arc mesh has become popular and
is used as a ready-made grill above the
counter, behind which the proprietor and
his goods are displayed.
Native clients still stand waiting their
turn in traditional style, the sole of one
foot resting on the instep of the other, and
one shoulder against the wall. But the
main difference is in prices. More money
held by the natives as a result of war-time
currency and payments for war damage
has brought about local inflation, and the
trade-store proprietor is one of the men
benefiting from it.
High prices charged for shoddy articles
offer a real field for reform of a type the
native would understand and appreciate.
—Lim-Limbu (N.G.).
The P.M.G.
What has come over the G.P.0., one
Government department which used to
give good service, but which now seems
to have adopted the lazy and inefficient
methods of so many others?
Within the last six months I’ve had
two letters go astray and never turn up.
I recently wrote a note to a friend who
lives two miles away on the other side
of the town. It was posted in time for
Monday’s mail and delivered on Thurs-
day. A, package sent from Melbourne
reached me at this country address only
after being sidetracked to the Sydney
suburb of Burwood.
Another letter, posted in Sydney, 300
miles away, on March 18, finally came
to roost on March 31. We’re still charged
that extra half-penny war-time levy on
every letter, and we’re getting only de-
creased efficiency for it. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Specialists in Uniform
University graduates and others who
came into the forces on specialised jobs
(B. 24/3/’4B) knew little or nothing about
soldiering and should never have had
to take parades and carry out similar
administrative duties —many of them lost
considerable face with the troops by
making a hopeless mess of such things.
Many of these specialists, medical
officers in particular, let their rank go
very much to their heads, and I’ve seen
young m.os. go “mad with the discipline.”
They were continually slapping people
on charges and never knew which section
of the Army Act to use; and they
exacted every possible salute, “Sir,” or
springing to attention when they walked
into a ward or room.
The claim is, of course, that medical
officers and other specialists need then-
rank to enforce discipline, but, if they
were merely “accredited” after the style
of war correspondents, this factor could
be easily dealt with. — Mac (N.S.W.).
Early in the war, every Australian
General Hospital had a doctor as a
registrar, and executive officer, but gradu-
ally these were replaced by non-medical
men who ran the show for the C.O. and
had authority over those of inferior rank
in non-medical matters. Later still, com-
pany officers were part of the establish-
ment —usually lieutenants who acted as
assistant executive officers.
Chaplains had rank without authority ;
so did Y.M.C.A. and Red Cross repre-
sentatives, yet they had no difficulty in
doing their jobs. If necessary they could
call upon some officer or n.c.o. to get
something done. —R. W. (N.S.W.).
The criticism of medical officers as
commanders of units is true of all the
ancillary services, and the only cure is
compulsory military training in youth.
“R.W.’s” theory has been tried and found
wanting. In the Imperial German Army,
medical units were commanded by com-
batant officers with doctors attached. That
system was abandoned in favor of the
British system in 1915. —M- H. (N.S.W.).
