Principles and Prejudices.
The rejection by a majority, proportionately
small, but numerically large, of the House of
Commons, of the Bill to permit an affirmation to
be substituted for an oath by members on taking
their seats, furnishes a fresh instance of the small
progress which has been made in allegiance to
principle during the last three or four centuries.
England is a Protestant country, and the funda-
mental principle of Protestantism is the rigtit of
exercising private judgment in matters of theology.
Yet here we have the representatives of national
Protestantism denying to the heretics of to-day
that which they applaud their forefathers for
claiming for themselves, the heretics of yester-
day. It is true that, had the vote been exclu-
sively a Protestant vote, the majority would have
been on the side of liberty of conscience. But the
fact remains, that, despite all the weight which
was lent to the Affirmation Bill by its adoption by
the Government, a strong minority of Protestant
members voted against tho principle which is
theoretically the very marrow of their schism from
the older Church. That the Roman Catholic mem-
bers should have voted against the Bill wou'd not
have been remarkable had it not been that so large
a proportion of these represent the Irish nation,
among whose grievances one of the moat bitter
has been that liberty of conscience was loag
denied to Roman Catholics in that country. What
is right in religion is as debatable a theme aa what
is right in politics. If it were wrong for Protes-
tant England to disqualify Roman Catholics from
the exercise of civil and political rights, it must
b > wrong for her to similarly disqualify Agnostics.
Yet the Irish members have always opposed the
emancipation of Agnostics, as though forgetful
of the arguments used in the long struggle
to secure, from professors of a dominant faith,
emancipation of Catholics. The exultation of the
Irish members, when the defeat of the Govern-
ment on this Affirmation Bill was ascertained,
shows how hopeless it is yet to expect even the
most recent and sternest lessons to teach men
that principles cannot bo altered to suit cases and
prejudices. These very members reason vigorously
respecting the case of Ireland, and adduce with
the most telling felicity all the rational demonstra-
tions which prove that in matters of conscience
and opinion the power of a majority, however
great, is an immoral force when applied to crush
tho convictions of a minority, however weak. Yet
the _ moment their own arguments are employed
against their own prejudices these men become
insensible to the potency of these very reasonings.
• • •
There is, of course, nothing novel in all this. We
have had abounding examples of the same variable
sensibility to invariable principles, in our own
community. Our pulpits are in the majority of
instances occupied by men who one Sunday
enlarge on the moral iniquity of the Papal power
in endeavouring to stifle free inquiry and the right
of private judgment during tho early days of the
Reformation, and the next Sunday bewail the non-
intervention of the Civil power to prosecute the
disseminators of “ blasphemy” and rationalism,
who are working so boldly and zealously in our
midst. There are hosts of people who regard
with contempt and abhorrence the attempts of
the Pope to silence Hues and Wtcltpfb, and of
Charles 11. to put down the Scotch Covenanters
in the past, and who nevertheless fervidly
applauded Sir Henet Paekks’ action tho other
day in silencing as far as waa possible Proctor ,
the scientist and agnostic. Even a stronger and
more recent illustration is available. Here we
have a host of people who habitually declare
their adhesion to the ‘‘good old English”
maxim of giving every man a fair hearing, and tho
equally good old Protestant dootrine of “ judging
all things, and holding fast to that which is good,
and who, nevertheless, are sublimely unconscious
of incongruity when they exultingly record and
applaud the endeavours of provincial corporation
and committees to prevent Redmond, the LaasT
League representative, from being heard. Sudfe
people’s intelligence may perhaps be tickled from
its partial paralysis by another and still more
striking illustration which lies ready to our hand,
Hero we have this same Mr. Redmond, represen-
tative of the Irish people, protesting with earnest-
ness and unanswerable logic against the bigotry
and defect of principle which would close his
mouth and does close its own ears. And there,
in the British House of Commons, we have his
associates and comrades evincing towards others
the same intolerant spirit which he so effectively
protests against when applied to himself. The
oases are as accurately parallel as any two cases
can be. Ihe bigotry of orthodoxy in Great Britain
holds Beadlaugh and his sympathisers in exactly
the same sort of impassioned and unreasoning de-
testation as the bigotry of class prejudice and
sectarianism holdo Redmond and his sympathisers
in New South Wales. If it be right for Irish
members, in league, for once, with a majority, to
deny participation in the common rights to Bead-
laugh on account of religions and political differ-
ences, then it is right for a majority in New
South Wales to deny the same rights to Mr.
Redmond here, on the same pretence. And
inversely, if it be wrong to deny, or to endeavour
to deny, fnll and free opportunities of stating his
case to Mr. Redmond here, and an equal share
of the general title to a fair and considerate hear-
ing, then it must be wrong for his comrades in
the House of Commons to deal with Mr. Brad-
laugh or any other agnostic in a similar spirit.
In matters of principle there are no two rights or
two wrongs, and there are no degrees of right
and wrong. Freedom of speech must be absolute,
or it is not freedom at all.
• • •
As for the attitude of the Irish members towards
Mr. Gladstone’s Government, it appears indi-
cative of a stupidity engendered by passion. It
is inconceivable that the Irish members of the
House of Commons can imagine that the cause they
advocate and the people they represent will gain
anything from a change of Government in Great
Britain. Were Mr. Gladstone to be driven from
office, it would not be Mr. Paenell who would
succeed him. The only possible successors of tho
present Whig-cum-Radioal Administration would
be the Tories. If Irish representatives were not
blinded by resentment, it would inevitably bo ap-
parent to them that the substitution of a Tory
regime for the present Liberal Administration
would bo the most tremendous calamity which
could befal their country. The Whigs truly have
lashed Ireland with whips; but nothing ii
more sure than that the Tories would scourge
that unhappy country with scorpions. At
the present moment Mr. Gladstone is pro
bably the best friend Ireland ever had in a
British Cabinet. That country owes him a
series of enormous benefits, which it is the
basest ingratitude and the depth of unreason to
forget. It is to Mr. Gladstone that Ireland is
indebted for the removal of that vested and op-
pressive iniquity the Church of Ireland. By that
one act of disestablishment Mr. Gladstone
established a title to the life-long appreciation and
gratitude, not only of all Irishmen, but of all
lovers of justice throughout the world. It is to
Mr. Gladstone that Ireland owes the best pro-
visions in its present Land Act, another benefit of
incalculable value. That this Act does not
effectually relieve all the evils it was intended to
remove, has been made one excuse for denying to
Mr. Gladstone all merit in the matter, whether
of intention or of accomplishment. But the gross
injustice ef this denial is apparent to all tempe-
rate and impartial observers. As originally
framed and introduced by Mr. Gladstone, tho
Irish Land Bill was a far more searching measure
than the Act as passed into law after being
mauled by the two Houses, of Peers and
Commons. Unmeasured denunciation has been
poured upon Mr. Gladstone’s head because ho
submitted to modifications which robbed his Bill
of a great part of its efficiency as a reformatory
and repara to ry measure. But there are two ways
of looking at the Premier’s submission in this
matter. One is that he never was sincere in
desiring to see his original draft become law. This
is tho view which has been adopted with passionate
precipitancy by the Irish people and their repre-
sentatives. The other view is more abstruse, and
consequently not so easily instilled into the minds
of a populace. It is that Mr. Gladstone,
thoroughly sincere in wishing to pass the
Bill in its integrity, perceived that, con-
sidering the prevalence of landlord interests and
plutocratic sentiments even among his own fol-
lowers in Parliament, and tho indurated antagon-
ism of his Tory and Conservative opponents, he
could not hope to secure all ho desired, and would,
in trying to insist on more than Parliament would
yield, gain no more, and endanger even what had
been conceded. The enactment of a Coercion
Bill, precedent to the passing of the Land Bill,
was regarded by the Irish as a gratuitous out-
rage. That it was a cruel insult the the nation,
we believe. That it was unwise, as creating an
indisposition to receive the Land Act in an appre-
ciative spirit, wo are convinced. But that it waa
a shot from Mr. Gladstone’s gun we do not
credit. That, too, probably, may bo considered aa
a sop to the dominant class in Parliament; and it
may have been Mr. Gladstone’s conviction that
some agrarian reform coupled with coercion waa
the only alternative for a denial of all agrarian
reform whatever.
• • • •
When one analyses the material of which even
the Liberal Party—so-called—is constituted,
recognises the real affinity of many of its parts
the Tories, and the strong links which connect a
multitude of even its most influential members
with the aristocratic and oligarchical castes, whose
very existence is dependent upon the maintenance
of the system of landlord supremacy and social
inequalities, it is astounding that Mr. Gladstone
succeeded in effecting so much aa he did. It
should be the baldest of truisms to state
that the Premier of Great Britain is in*
The Bulletin New Series.
With the next issue of The Bulletin will bo
inaaenrated a new series. The success which has
attended The Bulletin in its present form has
been unprecedented in the history of Australian
journalism. In the short space of three years,
this journal has obtained a popularity and circula-
tion justly regarded as phenomenal.
On the part of the proprietary no exertion has
been spared to keep pace with the appreciation
aranted to their enterprise. In catering for the
uublio expense has never been spared to secure the
very best article of its kind The spirit of pro-
areas has been supreme in the management of The
Bulletin. We have constantly boon striving to
make it better and brighter, and additionally
attractive.
But efforts in that direction found a practical
limit, That limit was the price of the paper.
There is not in the whole world a weekly publioa
tion which gives at the same price so much value in
literary wares. In any other country such a paper
aaTas Bulletin costs sixpence or an equiva-
lent sum.
Determined to go ahead, we found the price at
which we have been publishing, like a five-barred
Ete, obstructing the way. We have reached the
ait of commercial possibilities, while the range
of journalistic accomplishment yet lay invitingly
ahead.
There were only two alternatives, to stand still,
or to leap the gate. We are resolved to produce
A SIXPENNY PAPER.
We shall next week present to our readers a pro-
duction

tellectually head] land shoulders above the
average member of Parliament, has a wider
range of political vision, and a larger grasp
of social problems. But, truism though it be,
there is re»son to doubt if the full meaning ot this
superiority is, save exceptionally, realised. It is
the lot ot every man of exceptional capacity to
choose between two alternatives. The first is to be
content to live almost entirely for posterity : to pass
through life in an intellectual solitude, regarded
as a visionary, an iconoclast, and an impractical
being. The other is to accommodate his largeness
to the smallness of his surroundings ; to be prac-
tically useful by submitting to a life of compro-
mise, and an existence of half measures —managing
mankind, humouring ignorance and narrowness,
while gently leading and teaching. There are
hundreds of indications, scattered through the
career of Mr. Gladstone, which point to the
inference that the latter has been his choice, or
the career thrust upon him by circumstances.
Greater than his generation—infinitely greater
than the mob of well-born noodles, comfortable
country gentlemen, and purse-proud parvenus
who constitute the dominant elements in the
Parliament of Great Britain —Mr. Gladstone
has had to produce as his own workmanship,
articles which have, while yet plastic, been
moulded by clumsy hands and remodelled to suit
vitiated ideals. Submit the greatest artist that
ever lived to a similar ordeal, and what sort of
works would attest the grandeur of bis genius ?

From whom do Irish members hope for keener
appreciation of human rights than from Mr.
Gladstone? From the Tories? There is only
one excuse for so preposterous a concep-
tion In the House of Lords —the home of
Toryism and the castle of Landlordism —
a proposal was recently mooted, and amiably
received, that the Irish question should be comfort-
ably settled in a very simple way. What their
Lordships contemplated was merely that the State
should buy out the landlords and re-sell on the
easiest of terms to the tenant farmers. The sim-
plicity and directness of this process approaches
the sublime. As taxation is now adjusted in the
United Kingdom, it was tantamount to a proposal
that the poorer classes in Great Britain should
provide tho money to buy off the wealthy order of
Ireland—the Irish landlords. This would no doubt
suit the Irish very well; and, as misery is neces-
sarily selfish, it is not likely that they would
inquire very scrupulously whether their rtlief was
bought with honestly acquired money. But, if the
Irish members reckon on this, and think by eject-
ing Mr Gladstone’s Ministry to hasten the day
when the immoral bargain might be transacted,
they live in a fool’s paradise indeed. What Tories
and landlords in opposition would agree to,
as a desperate expedient, and what Tories
in power would attempt, would be tvo
very different things. Landlordism involves more
than money. To be a master over men has
a sentimental value, not likely to be lightly waived.
If the "ories came into power the Irish would
learn what coercion may bemade to signify, before
any compromise were attempted. In voting
against liberty of conscience and equal rights ; in
supporting a social Coercion Act, the Irish
members have shown that they do not know their
friends. Ireland has no chance of receiving justice
from a British Parliament until tho House of
Commons is controlled by tho Badioal party—the
true representatives of the unpropertied people of
England. The Radicals are to a man favourable
to the removal of religious and all other disabi-
lities. It is the parpetuanoe of such obstacles
which prevents their making their full influence
felt in the councils of the nation. The vote of the
Irish members against the Affirmation Bill struck
the Badioal party full in the face. And that blow
threw back the emancipation of Ireland from land-
lord exactions at least a decade, perhaps hale a
century.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Mr G. B. Simpson, Barrister-at-Law.
We have learned, on the authority ot a gentleman of
high character, that the statements with reference to
Mr. Simpson, in an article headed "Suoping with the
Devil,” are not in any sense correct. Mr. Simpson did
not advise the c'ient Yider in Sydney, and conse-
quently could not have given contradictory advice at
Goulburn, as alleged by Mr. Yider in his address to
the jury, published in the local journa’, and in no
way was the increase on Mr. Simpson's original
foe to be dependent on his success in the case
The matter having been Irought under our notice,
our sense of fairness makes us prompt to remedy what
may have created a bad impression where Mr. Simpson
is not known. Mr. Simp on’s connection with the
Vider case was entirely within the bounds of pro-
fessional etiquette and upright dealing. It is a matter
of regret to us that we had not sooner learned the
inaccuracy of the published report upon which we
commented, in order that we might have corrected at
an earlier period impressions which our article was
calculated to convey.
Testamentary Charity.
The bequest by old Costella, of Auckland, N Z , of
over £lOO,OOO to be apportioned among various deserving
charitable and useful institutions in that ci'y, has been
made the theme of considerable gush by certain weak-
minded and conventional contemporaries These ara
lost in admiration of the noble and grand charity of the
testator. They place garlands of sloppy encomiums
upon the dead man’s grave, and exhort rich men gener.
ally to go and do likewise. For our part, wo regard
testamentary charity as the meanest kind of benefi-
cence. Take this very case. Costella was, when living,
regarded as a kind of miser —a close fisted old
His will was made only two nights btfore he di d. All
the presumptions, therefore, are that Costella’s d-ath-
bed charity waa due to preeLely the same passion as
his penuriousness when in health Selflshne : s.
There is no evidence at all that Costella was
hoarding money all his life for the purpose of
benefiting tho poor after his death. Two days
before bis death ho realised that he had got “ to part."
Ha seems merely to have considered, as usual, what
under the circumstances would be the best investment
for himself, and caught on to an ancient fallacy, much
encouraged at all times by ecclesiastics, that the
Almighty can he bribed. The assumption that the
mau was actuated by tender compassion for the poor
and Buffering, won’t stand examination. A compas-
sionate sentiment, which only makes its appearance
when a man stands looking over tbe brink of eternity,
is exactly similar to the deep devotional feeling dis-
played by criminals upon the drop N y one would
dream of giving Mr. William Eykes credit for
havijvg always cheriphei deep re'igious and moral
4wc V'f Ufo Wri-ely because Ip bugs
a bible to his bosom on the siaffold, and
remarks that the hangman has his forgiveness. And
when a notorious nipper, with death clutching at his
heart-strings, wills away everything to the poor, it is
equally preposterous to fall down and adore his memory
ss that of a man full of generous impulses and self-
denying charity. For the man has denied himself
nothing. It has been meat and driak to him to hoard.
The chink of sovereigns has been to him the music of
an orchestra. His cheque-book his been a symbol of
influence and power. He has had and held all he
wanted in li’o, except o? course the inevitable “ more.”
The only luxury which a mau who leaves a fortune
behind him has denied himself has been the luxury of
giving. No man can blossom on his death-bed into a
tendeiheartedness worth twopence. The time for a
mau to be generous is while ho lives, and can be mean
if he tie's like it—aot when he isdying, and has to give
up his money whether be likes iter not. Why,the mau
must have, during half his life, been daily pissing the
doors of want end misfortune, with £13*1,003 in his
pocket, and keeping that pocket buttoned as tight as
his ears ware sealed to the voice of distress We don't
want to see many myre imitati Costella’s example.
We want ti see a lot so self denying during their lives
that they don’t k.ep e ough to mike their w.ll a sensa-
tion cn earth and a satire in heaven.
[?]arrant v. Wise.
When Mr. Tarrant, in a motion for ad j ournment in
tho Assembly, made charges against the demeanour
and management of Mr. W ise. Immigration Agent, ho
should have provided himself with something more
substantial than the petty complaints he ventilated.
If all that the honourable member alleged against Mr.
Wise were true, there was nothing in the case to
require that the deliberations of the Parliament of the
country should be suspended in order that Mr. Wise s
defects of temper or errors of judgment should be ex-
posed. Possibly Mr. W T ise may be crusty on occasion.
We have not Mr, Vf x is acquaintance, but wa have
seen him, ard he looks as if he could be snap-
pish as well as gallant. But suppose ho be. The
infirmity does not constitute a disqualification.
Men’s dispositions have to be averaged, and
it ii certain that Mr. Wise’s snappishness,
if it exist at all, has never created a scandal. That
officer has had, during a long series of years, direct
dealings with thousands of immigrants. If he were an
habitually cantankerous man, his disposition in that
respect would have been coir mon talk long ago. Now,
what one casually h jars of Mr. Wise, is rathorthe oppo-
site of w'aat Mr. Tarrant represented. And even Mr.
Tarrant’s own complaints are testimonies in tho
Immigration Agent’s favour. He not only w.nt through
the routine form of asking immigrants the stereotyped
‘‘any complaints? ’ bat he mingled among them, and
repeated the inquiry in a familiar confidential way.
This is just what a man in his position should
do, notwithstanding the susceptibilities of cap-
tains and medical officers. And, if Mr. Wise
did desire that matrons should keep a journal of
events, he did a very sagacious and proper thing.
Surgeon-superin'endents are sometimes very fine
fellows, hut sometimes they are just the opposite The
pay attached to the position is small, and it is t uly by
chance that a good man seeks the position. The
highest class ot doctors on immigrant ships are, as a
rule, young men who are beginning the world or
wonting their passage to the colonies. And a young
doctor is exposed to gre.t temptations in such a posi-
tioa. On the who.e, Mr. Tarrant appears not to have
made out any case whatever, and he comes out of the
busiue-s only a little better than tie Minister who
made so feeble a pretence of defending an old officer,
as-ailed by trumpery charges in an irregular way.
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
The Echo lately pronounced that “a Church
never was great but by tae greatness of its preaching.”
This is very EcHO-ish. The parson everything: the
laity nothing Words, not deeds. We demur, and
contend that a Church sever was great but by tne con-
victions ol its members aud the practical fruits ol those
convictions.
Mr. Julian Thomas, “ The Vagabond,” lecturing
in Invercargill, denounced the Salvation Army as an
unclean thing. Mr. Thomas added that he had studied
the working of the movement in Adelaide, where no
good had been done; on the contrary, the barracks
ware converted into a plaoo of assignation by members
and others, and the taotios of a musio hall ai d a “ free-
and-easy” had been introduced into what they called
religion.
It is currently reported that the Reverend John
Osborne is to be arraigned at fhe n. xt Wesleyan Con-
ference, to answer for his sermon inculcating Christian
charity of feeling towards Roman Catholicism, A
nobler sermon never was preached, or one more instinct
with the livirg spirit of honest and intelligent Protes-
tantism. We would counsel the Wesleyan Conference
to leave Mr. Osborne alone—at any rate until such time
as some Roman Catholic Priest delivers a sermon ex-
celling that of Mr. Oibotno in true Christian charity
and liberality of soul.
In all the wide stretch of country between the
Central Q reensland Railway terminus and the border
there are no churches and no parsons. Even at Blaokall,
a corporate town and the centre of a large populated
district, there is neither church uor chapel, priest nor
person. Bla k< and whites, Christians and heathen
are all alike in the one condition of religious unei.light-
enment, f l he cry from this Macedonia is “ come over
and help us,” but bishop and deacon, presbyter and
local preacher, give all the same response—“ How much
will you give us to coma cut and preach to you ?’’
At Newcastle, N.S.W., they refused Walsh’s
rimains Christian turial ; henoe —
Another mark of pries hood ; just one more.
To lot n< know they live—live as of yore.
No matter when, cr where, they ne’er abate
One jot to freedom their incarnate hate.
Oh, pitiable fools, that they should dare
Clutch at an immortal soul—dissolved in air—
Gone to its Maker—joined with spao* and time 1
His clay they kick; bnt that they ne’er will slime,
Flown far beyond them in the realms of God,
Unchained by power of priest or weight of eod.
Writhe on, ye worms, in midnight’s close caress.
And, if such doom there be, thine must be nothingness
Tho following, clipped from a letter written by
a travelling corresponueut of a non-iei gious tko
Stdnet Illustrated News, will deeply interes: bigoted
fools who have been bled by that transparent old
humbug, “ Father Chiniquy On my way I passed
the parish church in which Father Chin.quy ministered
before he abjured the Roman Catholic faun. His name
will be familiar to many of your readers, as his visit to
Austra’ia created some s*ir. I found opinions in Canada
much divided on the question of the utility rf Lis
labours and the genuineness of his character. I ven-
ture no opinion of my own—I metely tay that in
Canada and America, among circles where he is lest
known, Father Chiniquy is not universally regarded
with admiration, nor considered worthy of unlimited
confidence.” Booh 1
These are sweet and tolerant limes. “ A Chris-
tian” writes a letter iu tha W iini s)—a religious organ
very popular for lighting flies wioh—to Mr. Stuart,
asking him to stop the running of all Sunday trains and
trams except those that convey worshippers to the
i churches. The Freethinker" are very wroth about
j this, but wo can’t tea why they thould be Has not
! Sunday been the particular property of tl e olergy tinea
1 time immemorial? Very well, tlun, what do people
1 want going out by the seaside to hear tho echo of the
i voice of God in tho rolling breakers, whtn they can
hear tho very voice itself of Heaven speaking tbreugh
the mouth of a man who has probably been eating
onions tho night before, and can hear all Hell
into the bargain? But there are some st ff-necked
people in every community who ate never happy unices
they are happy in their own way The rigid and
ghoslly happiness of the Sabbath which is understood
to be so pleasing H the unfrivo'oua eyes ol Providence,
is only sepulchral gloom to them.
Whenever we want a first-class specimen of
slangwhanglng blackguardism, we pick up a piois
paper. Wo always find it. We picked up the Vic-
torian Banner the other duv, and the first thing that
; oaugUt our eye was a letter from “ Titus,” of Ttnicks
j East, headed “Denton a Pantheist” After aekmg,
j who h s ever known a Pantheist who was notan up-
, start and a fop? peer “Titus.” with all the well-
meaning earnestness of a mosquito laying himself out
to teriously hurt an elephant, says—“Pantheists all
swell themselves up until, growing beyond the propor-
tion of man, they put forth the claim, ‘ I am part or
particle ol God,’ And Denton has reached this altitude
of human presumption—this zenith of folly. He has
said —‘God is the universe and the universe fs God.’
Let us regard his claim for a minnta. He is of course
part of the universe, the same as a scorpion cr a lease
is part of the animal creation. It is made np cf such
things as ho is, the same as tbe seashore is nude up of
grains of sand and seabirds’ < fi ll The universe is
God —He is part of the universe. Therefore he is part
ot God. It such is the case, I have but one quest on to
ask, namely, can tbe foul and loathsome vermin which
infest our nocks bo termed part of the sheep? If so,
then Denton may with the consent t f all lay claim to
the part ol God “ The editor of the Banner is to be
congratulated upon po.-sesaing such a brilliant con-
tributor as “Titus.” “litus,” wa feel sure, does not
olten write to the papers, but as the “ bess” lately sold
most of the pig? off the station, “ Titus” has probably
more time on his hands now thin he used to have.
A reverend gentleman of the London Mission
Society preacbmu in South Australia on the “Religious
Condition of the People of India,” informed his hearers
that the moral condition cf the Hindoos was deplor-
able, and drew the following dreadfni picture ol their
degraded s.ate : —“These people were almost destitute
of conscience Falsehood, theft, blasphemy, impurity,
were not sins at all iu their estimation. Beating a cow,
tbe gioted animal, was a sin. Any blunder or mistake
or omission in tbe ceremonies ol their worship was a
mortal sin, while r he state ot the heart aud life was
deemea of no importance The ideas which they attach
to words, too, made it difficult to convey to them reli-
gious (ruth. Salvation was to tbem merely liberation
from the troubles and difficulties of life.” Ttiis is a
condition of things which must give a fearful shock to
the white who beholds it A missionary going from
here, for instance, where falsehoods, swindling, and im-
purity are considered cardinal crimes, anl those who
commit them detested by high and low, must be lor a
time hardly able to believe the evidence of his senses
that a coun'ry where such things exist is allowed to
continue uuoer the sun, and not crowned by water, or
blasted by fire. We daresay, now, the Hindoos ha«e nice
p eas, nt little names for these crimes, when they epaak
of tbem in polite society; lying we would wager is
oal el “romancing,” swindling “a smart stroke of
business,” aid adultery elegantly alluded to as a faux
pas. And they rely upon ceremonies, es all ignorance
does I Let us give thanks wo are not ignorant. If any
man were to ris i np here and say that millions of his
fallow-man would ne damned because they did not do
such-and-such things in such and-such a way, would he
be laughed at or stonsd ? imagine, too, tho wretched
position a people must be in who have no hell of Are,
and believe that salvati- n i? “ merely liberation fr-m
the troubles and difficulty< of life.” No golden haips,
no wings for the blessed ; no brimstone, no blazes for
the damntd I Ah 1 it is terrible.

Tho other night at a Wahgunyah (Vio.)
concert, Bishop Moorhouse addressed those pre-
sent on ” The Resurrectio n” At the same entertain-
ment, a not very youthful spinster with a thin voice,
sang ‘Why don’t the men propose?” The Wild
Bivtr Roman Catholics gave their priest a “finehorse”
j , d ay the “fiae” animal bucked and half
killed his reverence, who is now inclined to look the
gift horse in the month That enormously powerful
journal, the Kiama Independent, exhorts the Govern-
ment to proseeuto the Jf'reeininkers and Spiritual! ,ts of
Sydney under the blasphemy laws. As two theatres

tew now would bo wanted.
We beg to direct our readers’ attention to the an-
nouncement on our first page of the commencement,
with next issue, of the New Series of The Bulletin, in
a greatly improved form The illustrations will be, in
the New Series, a special feature. Mr. Maclkod’s and
Mr. Clint s work is already well-known to our readers.
Mr. Hopkins, our new staff artist, will make his pencil
serve as his introducer next week. Wo need only
remark that our Mr. Traill travelled all the way to
New York to secure Mr. Hopkins, and that heavy com-
plaints have been made n artistic and literary circles in
America at the loss whi> h illustrated journalism in the
United States has sustained by the spiriting away of
“L. Hop.” by an audacious Australian. Oar illua‘ra-
tions, hitherto executed by Messrs. E. and F. Mason,
will still, as regards portraits and other matters in
which these gentlemen are unsurpassed, be executed by
them ; while the new work introduced by Mr. Hopkins
will be produced by the skilled hands of Mr. Thomas
Gleason, an expert in a special branch of “gravure”
now for the first time introduced into Australia. Mr.
Gleason, like Mr. Hopkins, was specially engaged iu
Atntrica for The Bulletin New Series.
An Evangelical clergyman, who objects to High
Church practice?, eased hie pious soul at Porteea lately
by describing a neighboring clergyman as ‘ an apostolic
succeisor ol Juda? I-ca>iot and car «in bishops, as
“a ret ervoir of unhallowed thing?,” While the mere
though' ol the white theeud choir boys was so repugn-
ant to his pure Christ,like mind that he felt it nothing
less than duty to warn hi» hearers that “if there was
ary place on earth for the devil it was in the chancel,
whore they saw hy peer .tic 1 boys in white surplices with
black hearts; anl, instead of the ohance), being heaven,
it was a hell below, with a cone ction of tt e p riesthood.'
On the 10th May, 1890, the S M. Repaid will
quote the Hollowing irom the 'I isies : — ** Law and
Police —\t the Old Bailey, yesterday, Professor Tux
ley w tS charged with having written a pamphlet con-
tainir g scientific deductions calculated to throw doubt
upon iha Biblical account cf the Flood. The Professor
was sentenced to be put.on the rack and afterwards
burnt iu Trafa'gtr-squara His scientific works were
condemned, and handed over to the common hangman
for destruction. Yesterday an old woman applied to
the magistrate for his advice. In the same house with
there lodged a young man who was in the habit of
rlading a pagan pamphlet. Could she have a sum-
mons? The magis rate granted a summons, and, later
in the day, the young man’s guilt having been proved
by a domiciliary visit, be was sentenced to have his
ears cut off and his nose split Yesterday the Bav.
Stewart Btdlam walked in a shirt of hair "M with peas
in his shoes from the Monumtnt to Westi ins er Abbey,
via the .Embankment, to do penance toi _o,ving con-
s irtecf with stage players and profane dancers. The
Archbishop of Cantertnry met the nilgrimat the Abbey,
and witnessed the public flogging with which the inter-
esting ceremony concluded. This morning t?e mem-
bers of the Weather Forecast Society were ducked in a
horse-pond, and afterwards tarred and feathered, by
order of the Ecclesiastical Courts, for pretending they
had the gift of prophecy, and could tell what the
weather would ba the day after to-morrow. At the
game time, one Edison, newly arrived from America,
was burnt as a magician holding unlawful converts
with evil spirits, and endeavouring to discover the
secrets of Hat we wisely fiiddep fpip the eg of r^an."

Extract from the Continental Gazette,
Paris.
The most surprising triumph for an American product
at the Paris Exhibition was the success of E. Anhenser
& Co.'s Brewing Association of St. Louis, which
eclipsed Bass, Barclay and Perkins, Alsrp A Guinness,
the world-renowned English brewers, as well as hun-
dreds of rivals Lorn Austria and Bavaria. It is not
surprising that a great sensation was produced when it
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro.
nounced the St. Louis beer 11 superior to any malt
liquor ever drank upon the continent,” and that all
Paris is now reeking to quaff the American nectar.

The grave London dailies made solemn com-
ments upon “the attempted assassination" of Lady
Florence Dixie, ard almott demonstrated beyond all
controversy that Parnell and Justin M Carthy were i
responsible, even if they didn't hire the assassins. But
the independent weeklies, not being committed, like
the dailies, to ministering to the craze of the hour,
sneered at the whole business. One of these weeklies
(Truth) comments :—Everything connected with the
a-sault is miraculous Two persons of gigantic stature,
clothed ia green robes, and driving in a yellow gig,
suddenly made their appearance on the road before
Lady Florence Dixie's house. Notwithstanding their
remarkable appearance, and that the house is close by
Windsor, no one perceived them on the way to execute
their fell purpose. A soldier was passing by the house,
a publican was looking at it, and a gardener was
within a stone’s throw. They heard nothing,
and saw nothing. A terrible struggle took place,
and there were no marks on the soft gronnd of the
the encounter. The dog. who, according to Lady
Florence, saved her life by tearing the giants away
from her, has not a scratch or a bruise. Thrice did a
dagger descend on her, and it inflicted no wound. Her
throat was rudely grasped, and there is no mark. The
green-robed giants and their yellow gig vanished, after
their abortive attacks, into thin air. One is almost led
to the conclusion that they were visitants from another
world, or that Lady Florence must have fallen asleep
and dreamt what she has—no doubt in good faith-
recounted. If this latter be the true explanation, the
newspapers, which bave devoted oolnmus to ‘detail?,’
and articles on ‘details,’ in which it was conclusively
proved that the Fenians were at the bottom of the
affair, will have reason to congratulate themselves npon
their credulity." Sydney Echo, please copy.
Our Professor of English Literature has enriched
the subject be loves eo well by another poem. ** Nau-
sicaa” ia the name he gives it. Wo are very pleased
with him in this instance, because he baa curbed the
stream of bis imagination and oaneed it to fl >w in its
natural limits; in other words, there are no similes and
but one metaphor in the whole thing. But like all hie
other productions, it has the one unfailing charm of
a plenitude of words —not rich, rolling, sonorous, or
picturesque words, but simple, common, nursery words,
which go straight to the—stomach. And yet in one of
his highest poetio qualities we think there is a falling-
off in this poem : it does net contain as manv semi-
oolena as its predecessors. Where, however, the true
artist is discovered is in the repression of anything like
lyric fire or idyllic sweetness, or epic sublimity, or any-
thing, in fact, which might distract the mind of the
reader from the signature at the bottom. And why
this, think you H From any personal vanity f No, but
broause the signature is the only original thing in tbs
whole poem. We quote—happily we can quote from
any part indiscriminately without mutilating the
meaning
“ Had he but stayed, and had he not been wived.
How happy in his wedlook had I lived.
Watching him mid the heroes in the ring
Foremost in every art that flts a king.
And, when night drave ns into the high hall.
Hearing fair words from out his wise lips fall."
The gist of this verse might be pnt into two lines, as
thus
If he bad not slid and left mo sad,
What a high old time I might have bad I
These are as much to the point and contain exactly the
same amount of roetry as Mr Bladen’s six. But then,
when one is a Professor, one must be digniflel and
slow. It will ho noticed, by the way, that Mr.
Bladen has copied the manner (which he has de-
graded into an impertinent mannerism) without hav-
ing any of the matter—the body without the soul —
of William Morris. Morris is a true poet, for whom we
oherish a very tender feeling. Have we not dreamt
many a bygone summer eve away, lying on a cool green
river-bank, reading bis " Earthly Paradise.” Have wo
not lost onrselves in the enchanted land, with him alone
for a guide I And after this may we not be reasonably
pardoned for being aggravated at the publication of
snob inane doggerel, with evident intention of imitation,
as that which we have quoted P The publication, mind
you, is all we object to. The writing of such stuff we
suppose is a malady for whiob the author can no more
be blamed than he could for being born dumb—though
for the matter of that the latter affliction would be the
lesser of the two. It Mr. Bladen, instead of churning up
archaic words and then tnrning them out in pats of
poetie butter, would devote his talent to writing out
maxims for a new set of copy books for schools, ha
would please the public better and cover himself with
oonsiderably more glory. We will suggest <be first
maxim, small text: —The bad poet need never despair ;
there will always be stones to break." We’ve just
noticed, by the way, that we have departed from our
usual tone of light irony in the latter part of this para-
graph. Be it so. There are certain intellects which
require to be clubbed into a sense of their incapacity,
others that shrink at ihe mere sound of the whip We
do not for all that, however, indulge for a moment in the
delirious hope that the laureate of Cock-a-doodle-doo
will give up writing. He was born to cackle, and will
die cackling.
One of the most mercilessly caustic articles that
has appeared in the London World is devoted to the
late great Hussian diplomatist and general. Oortchakoff.
Orest, wo don’t say iu what. Full of years, laden with
orders, regretted by few, Alexander Prince Qortohakoff
has died ac Baden, after a lifetime spent in performing
the prime functions of pn ambassador. That does not
necessarily mean that be ever told the truth. He
closed his seventy odd years in the house of a well-
known lady of the "half-world," endowed more with
geld than geist, and there is more than snspioion that the
closing scene was expedited by some interested persons
who became impatient of the long time he took in
dying ;in plain words, that he was poisoned. But, it
doesn’t matter. As an octogenarian who fought knaves
for half a century with their own weapons, and com-
nutted his decrepit carcass at last to the onstody of
oocottes— why should it P His private life was neither
better nor worse than that of the sovereign he served,
for this princelv descendant of three saints was about
as wioked an old man as parsons' sous generally are in
public, and pious men often are in private, his ohief
merit being that he never disguised it. In fact, he
gloried in it, and would have been nettled if accused of
abjuring, for a single day, the vanities of the world or
the half-world. Long after youth and potenoe had
fled, the vain old diplomat fancied himself a lady-killer :
and, as long as his delusion could be ooined into
money, or used by female spies, it was adroitly pam-
pered At length, when every State secret became the
property of Nihilists, courtesans and boursiers, it was
not wise to trust him with such fragile wares, and be
was relieved from the cares of office. Then it was
that he was troubled with a "return of youth"
—became a giddy old boy as he had been a
giddy youDg one,—and half the Dalilas of Eu-
rope fluttered around the wizened Prince. The "re-
turn of youth ’’ comes to many an old dotard,
who mumbles the nursery rhymes which for peventy
years he had forgotten, loves boiled milk, and dotes on
three-cornered puffs and raspberry jam, ia caught pur-
loining sngar, and playing with alley tors and commoney s.
But there ia a worse aspect. This was exhibited by
Prince Gortohakoff, and is displayed by the padded old
satyrs who leer into the faces of milliners’ girls in
Bond-street, or gloat in impudent glare on the riders in
the Row. The appetite is there, but the digestion is
gone; and when the toothless gourmet does not tempt
his feeble stomach with strange meats be experiences a
depraved pleasure in reading well-arranged menus or in
staring at the dishes in the pastrycooks’ windows. In
the knavish Count returning to the deserted Catherine
of his youth, Thackeray portrayed this; so did Dickens
in bis description of Grandfather Small weed; Talley-
rand was not free from the impotent indulgence, nor
was the great Duke, nor was a late luminary of the
Benoh. Of course we are not now alluding to this
colony, or to any judicial luminary that either is or
ever was on the New South Wales Bench. We are only
saying how pitiful it is, when youth, love, a”d mental
and physical vigour are gone, to see passion atone
remaining. And, to come back to our Prince, this
peculiarity of old dotards was by him exemplified to an
extraordinary degree, and the profligacy ot his earlier
years blazed out afresh almost to the day he died in the
mansion of the well-known Madame Braun.

And of Mr. Farnell it siys that, though knowing no-

" it is a sound principle that members of a Government,

holders in the colonies is rapidly disposing of bis huge
Victorian intdretts—firstly, beoause he has not now the
energy and activity to manage them as he did a few
years ago; secondly, because he thinks the money can
be more profitably invested in Queensland property;
and thirdly, because failing health has induced him to
arrange for a visit to the old country. For Coraugs-

bill Mr D. Lindsay, who is to survey Arnheim
Land for the 8. A. Government, will in the coarse of the
work have to cross Leichhardt's old tracks, and will
try for information concerning that mysterious cele-
brity who is supposed to inhabit those regions—the
European with the “ flour-bag beard,” who has been so
often beard of through the blaokfcliowa. The country
which he will really explore, however—about 20,000
square miles, renghly—has never yet, so far as is knows,
been visited by any white man It is represented on
the map by a blank square. It has nevertheless, the
repute of being very fertile. It was at first suggested
that Mr Lindsay should conduct the exploration and
survey of Melville Island, which now has not a single
white unon it, and which has as unenviable a notoriety
for the fierceness of the blacks as for the vast numbers
of buffalo which run upon it; but ha will not be able to
undertake this commission.

day proceeded to open the institution by virtue of the
powers vested in them. 1 hough the day was a wet
one, 5700 persons attended between 1 and 5 pm. Next
evening there was a huge and ostensibly Sabbatarian
meeting at Melbourne Town Hall. J Ormond, ML C
who has given away such huge sums to public in,til
tutions, was in the chair—thus conclusively showing
were any proof needed, that a man may be liberal in
one direction and very narrow in another. The evan-
gelical dean was there in full fig; so were Holy Harptr,
Umbrella Mirams, Bilious Yale, the Lamb of Colling’
wood, and the inevitable crowd of ecclesiastics. Anti-
Sabbatarians were in very strong force, and the
elect were interrupted to such an extent tbit
the greater portion of the speeches were perfectly
inaudible. A resolution was mov( d declaring that the
trustee s “ had flown in the face of Parliament,” but this
resolution could not be put; nor could Walker, the
Freethought lecturer, who desired to move an amend,
inent, make himself heard. Th<-ir partisans on either
side yelled at each other with amazing vehemence.
Mr Harper finally rushed to the front of the platform,
and threw his hands in the air This was the signal for
the supporters of the motion to do likewise, and there
seemed to be a majority among those present who fol-
lowed his example. Mr, Fuller, a well known artisan,
then sought to give expression to his views on the other
side, and the minority then appeared to be very little
smaller than the majority. Another resolution wai
proposed, amid uproar and confusion, declaring the
injustice and injurieusuess of the action cf theiruate»i.
This having beeu declared carried, the meeting abruptly
terminated in great confusion.

A new burlesque bv Barnand has been a great
success at the London Gaiety. Though entitled “ Blue
Beard,” there is not much of the nursery story in it,
yet the dialogue is exceedingly sparkling and witty, and
it is studded all ‘hrongh with little ditties of tho most
catching kind. For instance, tho nimble-legged Wei-
lesley enslaver, the nice but naughty K ite, has a patter
smg about tho French langnsge, the dozen verses ot
which, rattled over to a swinging waltz tune in half ns
many minutes, always bring down tho house. Here’s
a bit
“ French language is a bother,
To learn it I don't care ;
Don’t hke ti hear my mother
Galled by the French a mire ; (mare)
1 I'ko a husband to myself,
B it the dear one is mod c her, (,hare)
Thmgh I’ve only got one f«tl ee
Yet they swear he is a pere, (pair)
When they moan ‘aye* then they say oui, (we)
They call a oheir a clause j
They have a word for strawbenies,
But then that word’* a /raise, (phrase)
And tho’ it makes no sort of noise,
They call a glove a gant j (rong)
And they have the airs of millionaires.
For a hundred's a mere.cent, (song)

“ Vouloz-vous dansez ? so polite.
Paries.vous frarcais ? oui! all »i«ht;
Avez vous, savez-vous, porter hiere.
Comment you 5 , portez-vous, Leioester-Equare.”
It’s the most infectious thing since that, rollicking
fa'ce, •'When I go out of door,” of the popular Bun-
tborce. The great polygamist himself, Baron A borne-
liqi'ie da Barbe Bleno, is represented by Nellie Farren
in the shortest of skirts ; and as the two chief female
characters are taken by Connie Gilchrist and Kate
Vaughan, in raiment equally bewitching for its brevity,
the piece draws the •’mashers” iu a mass. These
latter are not only caricatured by two children on the
stage dressed in the latest style ■ f idiocy, who do no-
thing but walk about like solemn posts wi*h an in-
iffably used-up look in th-ur fishy eyes ; but they have a
song all to themselves, which is really too good to keep,
and that’s really all we can give at present—
“Of ‘mashers’ there are plenty, mostly past the age
of twenty.
Their shirt-front is immaculately got up ;
Though their look is somewnab vap.o, they are living
rather rapid,
And there isn’t much in town to which they’re not
up.
In the afternoon at five they begin to he alive.
And they call each’other ‘ chappies’ also ‘ sonnies,’
And they wear a curly hat—hut—there isn’t much in
that.
And the set that they belong to are the Johnnies.
“ O, «t night they’re not piano, when they’re sapping
* dies ‘ Romano,’
Where they are on friendly terms with the head
waiter j
Or they take the sex that’s gentle to the * Globe ’ or
• Continental,’
Or any much-frequented restaurotenr.
They call champagne ‘ the Boy,* which they thoroughly
enjoy.
And of races talk from Houghton round to Lincoln,
And they always try to look as if they had a heavy
book,
And their favourite periodical’s the ' Pink ’un.’ *
“While the bottles they’re uncorking of ‘the Boy,’
they’re freely talking
Of • celebrities,’ whom each one * mashed ’ upon is ;
Though the girls they speak of so, the fools don’t
even know.
But call them all collectively the * Johnnies.’
And when they’re out at night, with a vest and tie so
white,
And collars trebly stiffened by the washers,
Note their little shoes and clocks on tneir variegated
830kS
And you’ll know that they are undefeated ‘mash-
ers.’ ”

This is a smart man’s criticism of Salvini as
King Lear; — “ JUe roars to .hat you feel liae asking him
to give the tempest a chance, Ho is not only every inou
a king, hat has several mi’es of kingliness iu excess of
tequiie i ents. Haivini’s King Lear was movtly noise.
Firing eff a cmnou would make mote loise than Sal-
vim even, but it wouldn’t be acting King Lear.” And
hire is another;-“A good yarn in spun of the late
Leopold Mey er, pianist. When iu Vi»nua, ho played at
Court, and when he had dom, the Emperor said ‘ My

As might have been expected, the benefit concert
to iklr. and Mrs. Woods was well attended. Musically,
it was a success, with the exception of two or three
items. Mrs Harry Woods was quite herte.f, and to
say that, means enough. Bat the Rhapsodie Gongroise
has been so hackneyed of late, that it needed all her
brilliant execution to prevent it falling flat. Liszt’s
symphonic poem, however, is seldom played as it was
on Wednesday by Mi s Wo ds and Mr. M’Qaaoe This,
and the Concert Sin ;k were the gems. The orchettra,
under Herr Tatek, n aa small r.ad good. La Narangera
“took." Mrs Spencer’s vocalisation was not as good
a few nights back as it was a few rears back, or, per-
haps, she and tho piano didn’t agree. But the Onet
with oignora Fabris was satisfactory. “True to
Death," by Mr. Woods, gaiacd an encore; and his solo
in ihc Liedertafel’s part song, “ Evening," was even
better. When tho applause had continued several
minutes, Mr Woods stent up and said he was sorry,
but the oonduo or refused to allow the Liedertafel to
give the encore I Mr. C. Huenerbein acted well as
aojomj auyist, and during the evening Mrs, Woods
received baskets of fluwtr* and bouquets.

Mr. Creawiok, the tragedian, who was so much
“out of It" in the oclmies, is more than correspond-
ingly “init ” at home. He conducted tbe Shak-
spearian Festival at Stratford-on-Avon, which began on
the 16th of last month. ’The Festival listed 'or twelve
nights, during eight of whicn Mr. Oreswick played
FaLtatf, Lear, and Richelieu.
Thus Thadeus o‘Kane: —“Bundaberg ia a
highly civilized place. They entertained a liv.i Premier
lately who, when he asked them whether they cared ‘ a
fig of tobacco’ tor the western country he intended
bestcw.ng cn the Syndicate, cheered him to the echo;
they didu t care a fig of tobacco or a Big Dfor any place
O'.-it Of Bundaberg, and provided they got a wharf and a
coat of paint for the Court House tie rest of the colony
may go hang for all they cared. Those Bundabergians
arc, notwithstanding this reckless disregard of other
people’s rights, higb.te.neo and oeithetio. They roast of
a School of Arts and are jealous of letting it to Phoenix
Park sympathisers and common actors. Herr Band-
maun askea for the use o’ their hall lately, and tho
secretary asked who he wis ? (alas for fame 1 O Herr,
hide your diminished beidand out oil your Hyperion
curls)—what was tbe nature of his entertainment, slack-
rope, monkeys or what ? who was the manager, and who
were the authors of the pieces he intended to play ?
This showed a careful regard for the morals c£ the
Bundaberg ladies. The Herriwas equal to the ocoussion;
he sent back tho ’ sun filibuster ’ the following telegram :
—‘ Manager's name Bandmann ; he plays pieces written
by one Shakspere, since dead; company astists him;
would play better pieces but cannot be had i • the
marten* The Bundaberg people are quite right in look,
ing after intinerant Shakspeares They know M‘il-
wraith well, and reverence him because he promises to
put money in their pockets, tut Shakspearo is a played
outrcli fossil, not worth, in those sordid days, ‘ a tig of
tobacco.”’
The Late Hon. J. Bowis Wilson.
Our portrait is that of the late Hon. J. Bowie
Wilson, whose death was announced last week.
Mr. Wilson for several years took an active part
in public affairs, and held the portfolio of Minister
for Lands in the Martin Administration. As a
politician, Mr. Wilson was not very successful,
and at no time exercised large influence His last
public duty was the Lord Howo Island Inquiry,
which, judging by a report of a select Parliamen-
tary committee m the matter, was conducted with
much partiality and prejudice. Mr Wilson, what-
ever his ili-suocess in politics, was a genuine re-
former in social matters, and an advanced liberal
thinker. He enjeyed all his life a character for
unswerving uprightness. [Our portrait is by
Newman, of Oxford-street.]

The following extract from a letter to Mies
Lydia Hastings, the elocutionist, explains itself, and
will be read with general interest“ I received one
year's instruction m vocal music from the celebrated
taignor G roia, in L ndon, and for some time have
been taking lessons from a very prominent profess, r in
this colony; both of these gentlemen complimented
me on the quality and management of my voice. Be-
lieving my voice had non been developed in its capacity
by any system I had tried, I determined (upon seeing
your advertisement), to try your Bystem of Voice
Building, and to my astonishment, in the first lesson I
learned that I had not known how to breathe properly,
or how to use the vocal organs to advantage, and
knew nothing whatever of vocal gymnastics, hut
now, after only a few lessons, I find my voice to
be one half strenger and moie easily contiolled than
I began with yen, and my articulation has so much
impiovtd that I feel my singing is not mere ‘songs
without words,' and the practice of your System hat
much improved my general health. 1 take pleasure in
expr.ssing my thanis to you, and, were ic in my
power, wou’d make known to all the singers and vocal
students in the colonies the happy and rapid results I
have derived from your instruct ions. I am sure they

PEPPER AND SALT.
THE DEATH OF DAVID.
We have felt, and rather earnestly, that the boy
has stood on the burning deck new for a good many
years, that the skipper who took with him his little
daughter has also frozen on to his tiller to the admira-
tion of an easily-satisfied public for a considerable
period. Norval, too, has talked all about his father
on the Grampians until the fact of the old fellow feed-
ing his flocks has lost the enthralling interest with
which it was once encompassed, and it appears to ns
that Marmien has had more than a fair show for
several deoades with his “ Charge, Chester, charge— on»
Stanley, on,” to say nothing of the Giaour, who has
asked us if we “ know the land where the cypress and
myrtle are emblems of deeds that are done in their
clime,” to an extent which we consider bordering upon
the obtrusive. Wo have, therefore, resolved to trot a
few new heroes out, and put a little on their plates.
The style we have adopted is, as will be presently seen,
of a lofty description. We have not only practised in
our humble street until even the milkman has caught
the music of our trochees, but wo have let our hair
grow for it, worn our shirt-cellar low for it, and have
generally identified ourselves with it in every inex-
pensive manner that either experience could devise or
imagination suggest. And, talking of poets, we wish it
to be distinctly understood that we do not limit our.
solves to one in this establishment. Did we do that we
-hould, when tomahawks were cheap, be out of poetry
hree issues in every four. Oh, dear, nol Wo always
have an extensive assortment on hand, and we use very
often as many as two a day in the hot weather. Many
persons calling round on a sultry day will probably have
observed a bundle of clothes and hair swept away into
a corner. Well, that will be a bard who has succumbed
either to a bludgeon or to the afflatus. Curious people,
poets, by the way. We had one once who bought a
shirt which a curio-man alleged to be Shelley’s, and re-
garding the garment as sacred, he wore it for so many
months that we were reduced to the necessity of making
him hand his espy over the back fence on the end of a
olothes-prop And we had one, too, who started re-
gularly three times a week for Parnassus, but never got
any farther than Little Nelly’s hotel at the corner of
our street. He is dead, too, this one. Three courses
and a dessert killed him. And one thing we are all ad-
dicted to—from the soulless groveller who writes
blanket-verse, to the haughty singer who ” reads the
secrets of her soul when he looks in her eyes !’’ It is
this. Whenever things don’t go right, or the gods have
temporarily turned off the metre, we say: "We will go
and visit Kendall’s grave.” Some of us didn’t know
Kendall in the flesh; but, bless yon, we all know his
gravel There is something pleasantly pathetic in
meeting a friend, and in declining an offer of a game of
skittles, says ‘‘No, no; not to-day”—draw a long
breath here—"l am going to visit poor Kendall’s
grave.” It elevates yon for the time above the base,
sordid, and unpoetic common herd. An enthusiast of
our acquaintance once went down, taking with him a
choice assortment of seeds. Then laying himself down
on the grass, he wrote a dirge that must have made
poor Henry rattle his bones in agony, and then made
ready to sow the seeds. But another pilgrim came up
just then who was learned in gardening, and he dis-
covered that the dirge poet had come to the shrine with
a mixture of mangel-wurtzel. mustard-and-eress, and
carrot-seed. That bard’s dead, too. We forget what
he died of. The sight of a lovely rosebud in the ugly
guttah, probably. But now for David Heml The
lute, as usual, dear mothah, off the nail. So:—
In the broad street of Macquarie there nprears a wide
facade
Of a mansion which, once gorgeous, mow is shabby and
decayed.
Yet before it bloom fair flow’rs of every tint, of ev’ry
hue.
And their odours mingle with the mansion’s morning
gush of stew.
In a room (the back sky-parlour) lay a tall and pallid
man—
Ob, his eyes were sorely hollow, oh, his face was pinched
and wan;
His poor form was gaunt and grisly, his poor lips were
white and thin—
He within that mansion boarded—*' one pound and his
washing in.”
Bound his couch were anxious watrshers— “ Cheer up,
David, come 1” they said.
But a deep-toned groan of horror was the answer from
the bed.
But a deep-toned groan of horror—then he cried:
“ That’s my death-knell;”
Yet’t wasbut the evening tinkle of the muffin-merchant’s
bell.
" Baise me up,” he gasped, " and let me gaze upon the
sunlit sea.
Typical each golden wavelet of the happy and the free !
Yet I seem to eie reflected on its waters calm and
bright
Such a train of grisly horrors, that my soul’s filled with
affright.
Visions of distorted cattle ’’—hero quite thickly came
his breath—
“ Cattle which—oh, dread suspicion !—all have died a
natural death.”
" Sheep more flukey than the novice when he bangs the
balls about;
Blear-eyed mullet, belly-upwards, which a starving
slave would scout!
Hideous swollen cabbages that bob up, seething, eheek
by jowl.
With the saddest and most spectral, and the skinniest
of fowl I
As I gaze upon those waters all these horrors, new
believe.
Mingling with some still more awful, still more ghastly,
I perceive!”
Vainly they all tried to soothe him, smoothed his pillow
and his rug;
Pressed on him with warm entreaties, beer that stood
by in a jug.
His transparent arm he stretched forth, and be smiled
a gentle smile.
While his friends knelt down around him in the well-
known ballad style.
Suddenly a plump and comely woman glided in the
room.
Of a ghostly white her hands seemed in the fast-increas-
ing gloom;
▲a she pressed them both together, 10, there (ell upon
the floor
Little olottds of (airy snowdrift such as none bad seen
before.
Then said she: “ I’m snmmoned by yon, and 10, David,
I am here;
Speak, as moments are fast fleeting." Then the sick
man dropped a tear:
11 You are summoned. Arm Jane, hither ’cause alone it’s
yon and I
That are in the dreadful secret why I am about to
die."
Up the long light vistas started, as though a magician’s
wand
Had touched ev'ry street and ham’.et through the
breadth of all the land;
Then Ann Jane, with bosom working, while each one
upon her glares.
Wipes her eyes upon a duster which she'd brought up
from down-stairs.
“ Just a week ago last Tuecdrj," David said, in solemn
tone,
"Joyous as the soaring song-bird, I walked home from
'biz* alone.
Open early were the hivt-gates; 'twas but two and
three between,
Somebody bad had a birthday nobody had ever seen.
"Booted to a dcwn-stairs window in this thrice ac-
cursed place.
Just a few abort minutes later cotld bo teen a pallid
face—
Eyes transfixed with rigid horror, soul all frozen up
with shaaco.
Forehead with cold sweat bedabbled; hards and neck
and arms the same I
Then you could have heard a loud cry, a falling bedy
windows crash—
I had seen the wretched woman in her kitchen making hash.
" Frankenstein at Monster-making didn’t seem to
clutch much bliss,
Yet, with all its grisly horrors, his work was a fool to
this 1
All the chop-tails left from breakfast went in that un-
holy stew.
All the half-gnawed bits of bacon and potatoes went in,
too;
Bits of biscuit, haada of herrings, unsoraped carrots—
’tis the case-
in that witch’s horrid cauldron f jund a weird and awful
place I
Bound she stirred it in tha saucepan wi.h a most mali-
cions grin,
And, while larking with tha baker, two small kittens
tumbled in.
Then the fowls that came and pecked it I and the big
dog from next door.
Who came in and gnawed a little, then declined to go
for more ;
Then the blacking-brush, the ' bocta ’ on the floor threw
in a huff,
Bang I against the wall rebounded, and went plank down
in the stuff.
Then I knew my I cart was broken—then I heard a deep
drawn eigh,
I to ‘hash’ had lean so partial—so I lay me down to
die."

We see that a gentleman named Oakley recently
killed his mother-in-law in Adelaide, and is reported to
“ take the matter very coolly.” We should think he
did 1 Mr. Oakley only threw her out, and she nnfortu
nately broke her neck. It is just on the cards, we
suppose, that our friend O. will drop into it for this;
bat, at tho same time, he will have conferred, by his
determined conduct, even at the sacrifice of his liberty,
a lesson to mothers-in-law, which should not easily be
forgotten. Oakley, however, is only partly glorious. He
didn’t do it on purpose, though his intention was evi,
dently to break a bone or two. We have killed a good
many mothers-in-law in eur time, and, therefore, have
seme experience in the process. A little hatchet
comes in handy; but, then, you must have a lagoon or a
disused pit near, where yon can hide the body. There is,
it seems, a prejudice now-a-days against murdering even
your wife’s mother I What’s the world coming to?
Living in a neighbourhood, now rather too populous
to admit of one’s carrying away the body in a sack, like
the brigand in '• Bigoletto ” (this to our sorrow, for we
could murder a mother-in-law in this style with neat-
ness and dispatch, and also execute country orders—
allowing a liberal discount to the trade, this mode—a
pleasant and airy one—embodying ease in execution
and the pleasure of enjoying the prospect whilst carry-
ing the sack)—we have tried other means with our
last mother-in-law, but they have not, so far, been
crowned with success. We have put beetle-poison in
her coffee, and cyanide of potassium in her sugar; and
we have even gone so far as to put a snake under her
pillow. But, she has not expired up to the hour of
going to press, yet we live in hopes. It’s a pity we never
thought of taking her to the “Romany Bye" when
that was on. That would have settled her.

Alfred is always springing surprises on us.
Here is a shook which appeared in one of his last week’s
issues:—"Few people suppose the artistic faculty is
developed to any extent in the Australian blaokfellow.
But he has had glimmerings of art, and several of them
are illustrated in this week’s Town and Country
Journal ” And this, after we have gone on believing
(or years past that the illustrations in the Town and
Country were the work of aboriginal artists all the
time 1 We apologise to a sufficiently unfortunate race
for cur unworthy suspicion of them.

There are ‘ ‘ ructions in Sydney society! ” Lord
Lennox and Mr. Drummond, when here, gave all the
Sydney swells the cold shoulder. They did not even
enjoy the sanctified shade of 8.8.’s historical umbrella
One pretty little lady, whose dad is what Alfred
eloquently calls a " knight of the hammer,” got a trifle
" put on her plate” by his lordship ; and, immediately
all her friends heard this, they took (as one girl) all
their " chaneys out her yard.” So the social hopscotch
is a bit off just now. As a matter of fact, it is generally
off a little when any " Blarated British swell” turns up.
At the time those nice little boys, the Princes, were
here, half Maoqnarie-street was hissing atDarling Point,
while a Potts Point Duchess we knew went to bed for
three days in sheer vexation. That was because the
Princes wouldn’t he let come cut to her house «n fete-
d-fete—or for a parti earn!, it you like that better—in
which she could get them to tell her over the souchong
all about "Papa,” and " Uncle George" and "Uncle
Alfred.” Tha fact is a lot of the people out here don’t
know how to treat the born patrician. If they are
crawled to (as they always are), these golden children
poke “guiver" at our crowd, and always take care to
let their entertainer know that ho keeps a shop—which,
in nine cases out of ten, he does. Lord Lennox didn’t
call at our offiae, but that was, we suppose, because wo
are always poking fun at the Czar and frightening him
into putting off his coronation. Had, however. Lord
L have looked us up we should have known how to
treat him. Being the younger son of a Duke be would,
in all probability have had no money, so we would have
lent him enough to have in his poeket so as not to look
as if we were “setting ’em up all the time’’—(or
we don’t like to be ostentatious even in hotels where
we are known. Then we should have made a merry
quip or two in verse on the old man at home, and finally
exchanged heirlooms. Bafcre that, of course, we
would have taken bis lordship on to the Quay, and
pointed out to him a boiler we could recommend when
the lady’s countenance at the Boyal commenced to
wear a pensive aspect; and when sent for Chateau Mor-
gan,):, the waiter would come back, after half-an-honr or
so, with a bottle of Meioo at 2s. 61. This has occurred
to ns, and wo saw immediately that an hotel where
human nature was thus outraged was no place for us.
However, Lord L. didn’t come. It was his loss of
course; because down our way we are men of infinite
jest, and by long practice adapted to the amusement of
all classes —from th e dull dog of an hereditary Prinoa
to the sprightly and intelligent artizan Now, this is
what we call a smart bid for the support of the
wurrukin man—a bait for the grasp of the homy-
handed.

Great men—we mean, very groat men—appear
to object to street musio. “ The Vagabond” did, it
will be remembered ; and a nice “ doing" he got from
old Biily Boberts, who appeared for tho German
band. Probably no man ever looked so ‘'wipedoat’’
as the " Vag.” when he retired from the witness-box.
He couldn’t fetch up a Santiago smile or a Parisian
pucker, no matter how often he sent down the bucket
for it. He hadn’t a word to say about his cld pal
Bismarck, or how he and Qrevy made vol au vent d la
Financiere in the salons of the Ely bo 9. He was para-
lyzed. Now wo see that Comyns Carr, the art-critic of
the Telegraph, and a man of very distinguished abili.
ties (but not so distinguished as the Vag.), who reside!
in Blandtord-square, London, also objects to th«
itinerant performer, while his neighbour, Mr. Straw,
bridge, encourages the perambulating musician. In
this case Mr. Comyns Carr gave the man into can-
tody, and when the case cume on, it was dis-
covered that the musician had a certificate of pro-
fessional skill from the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr.
Carr, however (who, by the way, is a musician and
a dramatist, besides being aa artist and a critic),
not content with this, writes a sarcastic letter to the
London Standard, and so now the war is raging. The
only man who will probably benefit in all this will be the
musician, who will, in all human probability, give solos
now on the barrel-organ or whatever he is proficient in,
and eventually marry a Duchess. Duchesses and these
people like musicians as a rule. It's hard to guess why
it is—something in the rosin, perhaps. Look at Hizzio
and Mary Q seen cf Scots, for instance. But those were
giddy times. There is one thing in all this, though, that
makes us serious. Comjns Carr will be probably cast
in damages about the Blaudford-square business, and
it was only the other day some high-spirited young
Sydney fellow was basely fined £lO for knocking down an
organ-grinder. Things are coming to a pretty pass.
When Parkes was in power he certainly curtailed
onr liberties a good dail; but wa should be melancholy,
indeed, did we thiuk that it is still within the power of
any Sydney citizen to knock down a man with a barrel,
organ. Doubtless there has been soma mistake, and
the fine will be remitted, and a fireman’s medal (they
are plentiful enough) presented to the defendant over a
glass of something hot.

A country paper describes how the local under-
taker was thrown from a spriog-cart while bringing a
corpse for burial. The corpse, it appears, then took up
the reins, drove on, got to the cemetery, and there
delivered itself up to tho gravedigger, who jammed it in
its coffin, rolled it into the grave, and made all right by
the time the undertaker came round. This is what tbe
gravedigger says, anyhow, ana the undertaker supports
him. Tha undertaker also accuses the corpse of having
knocked him out of the cart because he wouldn’t stop it
at a hotel on tbe road. This is a most uncommon story,
and did great credit to the quality of the local rum.
But, before we give it unconditional credence, we should
like to bear the corpse’s version.

The result of a series of experiments on pigs,
made by ten English doctors, for the purpose of
ascertaining tho effect of alcohol on the internal organs
of drunkards, was that after the pigs h*d been
treated with alcohol for some time their vital organs
wore found to bo marked with small white spots
resembling nloers. The reasoning here is sound. A
drunkard is a pig, and, therefore, what happens t« one
drunken pig must kappsn to another. But they icere killed
Now, if they had been allowed to live and been con-

doctors to take this up and experiment on some humtn

the original Phyllis was a young Thracian lady. She
was to have been married to a fellow in the Grecian
Permanent Artillery named Damaphon, but the latter
was so Ionsr in arriving at the hymeneal scratch (ho had
been abnned in the Athenian Legislative Assembly by
the M'Elhone of the day, when the Estimates came on,
for running up rceut-aud-glnve bills, and this got hia
creditors on to him with District Court sumconses)
that the lady strangled herself with her garter, and
thus burst up the cort'act. We hope that the Echo's
best girl won't do this. Phyllis’ present trouble ia
“ the waltz.” “We love dancing," says this gay young
thing, " for ita own sake—for the rhythm and the
musical movemen’—but we love it most of all because
it sets off to advantage onr figures and our graceful
bearing. For purposes such as these our slow waltz ia
undoubtedly the moat effectual " We flrd that we must
again, for Phyllis’ edification, quote the shirt-collar
poet, Byron :—
“ Hail, moving Muse I to whom ‘be fair one’s brea t
Gives all it can, and bids us take the rest.
Waltz—Waltz, alone—both legs and arms demania.
Liberal of feet, ami lavish of hands ;
Hands which may freely range in public sight
Where ne’er before—but—pray * pnt out the light.’
Met hints the glare of yonder chandelier
Shines much too far—or I am much too near."
And then be proceeds to go into snob minnti derails
respecting Phyllis’ favourite “slow waltz,” a< danced
in his day, that we well
" might marvel, with the modest Tnr t.

It is in the.rinalc of Phyllis' Satardi y lecture, however,
that she ♦ tfeotuallw succeeds in shocking as* for she
coolly sings:—‘‘We dance in order to he admired.

What is this we have ? “ The nobility of Eng-
land, loUowirg the example of the Queen, ha a resolved
to abstain from lamb as an article of daily food. This
step has been taken with the view of increasing the
supply of matton, an 1 of bringing it within the means
of the poorer classes." This is an example of that chi-
valrous generosity which distinguishes the members of
the aristocracy all the world over. Wa are surprised,
however, that they did not. when they were at it,
extend their self-denial to truffl is and turtles, and some
of the rarer brands of wine. It would look well, and do
the poorer olasaa* about as much good as tne abstinence
from lamb. The poor are notorious consumers of all
these things, and wa have no doubt, it the nobility
would go the whole hog, would be proportionately
thankful. Going the whole hog reminds us that salt
pork is an article of diet among the mere luxurious of
the lower classes—this the nobility don't seem to
have taken into consideration. The prioe of potatoes
and liver might also be abated without hurting the
fei’iags of this susceptible class. But enough of the
poor It is quite bad enough to be one of them our-
selves, without having to write abont them. The
aristocracy—bow we worship the word 1—might extend
thair self-denial to their own class, and yet be held in
ne less esteem. Borne of them might, for instance, ab-
stain from meddling with their friends’ wive >, and so
bring those wives within the reach aud means of their
poor husbands. B it we feel that to ex poet this of them is
toe much. If thiy did this they would bo respectable,
and to be respectable is to be common, and rather thaa
be common, what no bis spirit is there that would not
die?

The feud between the partizans of the Monta-

Taylors—of Parramatta, having somewhat cooled down,
there were at last Diatriot Court sittings no oases
either of mnrdet or of “ assault to kill” down on the
list It was in consideration of this faot that that
most eminent of Little Fedlingtonians, “ Yooey ’*

those who are blessed with the honour of bis acquain-

which, though intended to appear quietly impromptu,
might possibly, you know, have been—er—thought
over enoe or twice on the previous day. That waa all
right enough; bat when Judge Wilkinson had clutched
th- gloves, thanked the Gladstone of Parramatta for
them, and had just commenced to wonder whether
or not they d burst up first time of putting

of judge, jury, court offi dais, and everybody on hand,
to audross an oration to Mr Archibald Frazer, Clerk of
of the Peace. Why he should have offered Mr. Frazer
a pair of white gloves any more than he should have
tendered him a pair of black boots or a nightgown, will
f.»r ever remain one of the most inscrutable mysteries

English face Then Yooey handed over the gloves,
shat his month, and sat down, quite unc nscious of the
fact that he had been addressing a well-bred Scotch-

two deal forms, white as the driven saow, awaiting a
Terpsichorean offer from either the party with the
bears grease, who keeps the shoe shop, or the cavalier
with the gloves, who pounds the podiphyllin. No
servant-girls there, we can toll yen. No odour of soap-
suds in that assembly, hear in mind—though, perhaps,
it wouldn’t hurt it if there were Well, the sight of the
chosen male ones in this assembly, putting on pumps,
and the female ones putting on frills, has exasperated
the ineligible youths of tne town. And th<s
has led to complications. Sometimes, j ist as the
assembly has been in the vortex of the varsoviana,
the company would stop short, stare with tha
stony stare of marble statues, and then commence to
spasmodically sneeze until their barking sounded, to
the bumble hamlets that were distant, like the howling
of a paok of Khivan wolves The MC. was a terriflj
sneezer At his first “ a-tsh uI” he invariably extin-
guished the light—a proceeding which perhaps nnder
other circumstances would to the company have not
bean unproductive of hilarity. On other occasions,
while the brilliant throng is deep in the tnm-ti-ti-tum
of the luncerj, mysterious jet* of water, locking pris-
matic in the gay light, are tquirted in throagh the
various easements. One day, a demon in the outward
form of humanity, during a long interval between ths
dances, quietly strewed a handful of No. 3 shot upon
the polisued parterre Next day a third of the assembly
was m the hospital, while the remainder were obliged
to go throagh their various business avocation* with
blackened optics and excoriated noses Recently a
meeting was held by tha members, at which a resolu-
tion was unanimously passed, that unless the society
could engage an a<ry cellar to danoe in, and subsidize
eight policemen to watch it, dancing would have to

BICYCLE BIDING v. PBATING.
Yon have read of the ride of Paul Bevere,
And of Gilpin's ride, so fraught with fear;
Of old Floyd Ireson's ude in a cart.
And the ride where Sheiidan played a part;
Calender's ride, on a brazen hack,
And Islam’s prophet, on Al Borax ;
The fatefnl ride of Alix from Ghent,
And a dozen others of like portent;
But yon never have heard of a bicycle spin
Whieh was piously ended, though started ia sin.
Tom was a country parson’s sop.
Fresh from college and full of tun •
Fond of flirting with bright-eyed girls.
Having, in verso, over golden curls;
Sowing a wild oat hero and there,
In a way that made the parson siare
And chide him sternly, when face to face,
Whi e, in private, ho laughed at the young scape-
grace;
But the wildest passion the boy could feel.
Was the love he bote for his shining wheel.
On Sunday morning the sun was bright.
The birds' throats bursting with glad delight.
When the parson mounted his plnmp eld bay.
And j ogged to tha church—two miles away ;
While Tom wheeled ’round, ten miles or more
And hid his wheel by the chancel door;
And he thought as he sat in the parson's pew,
“ I wonder what makes dad look so blue,”
Till it came like a flash to his active mind
He’d left his sermon and specs, behind.
Now, the parson was old and his eyes were dim.
And he eouldn’t have read a line or a hymn
Without his specs-, for a mint of gold.
And his head turned hot, while his toes turned cold.
And right in tha midst of his mental shock
The parson deceived his i rusting flock.
And gave them eternal life and a crown
From the book ha was holding upside down.
Tom, the rascal, five minutes before.
Like an arrow, had gone from the chancel door.
The horses he frightened I never can loll.
Nor how the old church folks were shocked as well
But they said they feared that the parson’s lad
“ Was-a-gattin' wild,” and would go to the bad.
For 'ewas wicked enough to ses folks in a craze.
Without ‘ ridin' sech races’’ on Sabbath days-
And they thought the length of the patson’s prayer
Had something to do with his fatherly care ;
While the truth of it was—which he afterwards
dropped—
He did not know what he could do when he stopped.
Of course you know how the story will end
The prayer was finished and duly amen.od.
When Tom, all oust, to the pulpit flew.
And laid down the specs, and the sermon too :
And the parson preached iu a timid way
Of sinful pleasure on Sabbath day ;
And ho added a postscript, not in text,
Saying, that, when they were sore perplexed,
Each must decide as he ohauoed to feel •
6 nd Tom chuckled, “ Sundays, I'll tide my wheel."

POLITICAL POINTS.
The victorious Chilians have found a Capua in
Lima. Whole troops ore prostrated by the effects of
their debaucheries, and the Peruvian guerilla forces
seriously threaten them. The Chilian Government is
alarmed at the situation, and should send for Dr. L. L.
Smith.
“Number One " ia now positively identided as
General Millet, US,A., also as Tynan, a London
volunteer, likewise as Egan, and similarly as Walsh
The Government possesses positive proof that he is
each ot them. It is ant ideated that the United Skates
Government wid immediately consent to the sxtradi-
tion as soon as they have arro-ted all ef him. Peter
Campbell has also identified him as Redmond.
Mr. Libonohore says that it is a curious fact
that Carey was first brought into notice by the Conserva-
tives of Dublin and owed his eleition as Town Coun-
cillor to them- Carey originally came forward as a
candidate for municipal honours in Trinity Ward, the
most Conservative of all th« Wards in Dahlia. His
nomination paper was signed by two Conservatives —
Mr Georgs M’Qaeshen and Mr Robert Stuart—and he
was elected by a certain number of Conservative! voting
for him, instead of for tha Conservative candidate, Mr.
Natty.
The House of Commons, as custodian of the
nxtional purse, voted £lBOO to the Duke ot Norfolk, as
oiaimutation of fees claimed by the Duke of Norfolk,
as Earl of -Surrey. These fees originated in the time of
Richard 111, whan the Earl of a Shire was charged with
its defence, and had a right to be paid for undertaking
so responsible and costly a duty. For centuries tke
Dukes of Norfolk have been drawing £6O per annum for
defending tha people «t Surrey; and now the Duke
claims and receives £lOOO for waiving his future fees,
although there has been a standing army for over 300
years. Swindle I
In the Fortnightly, Henry L»bouohsre,
Bradlaugb’s coadjut w in the representation of North-
ampton, writes on “A Democrat on the coming
Democracy" Hi says the House of Lords owns
14.300,000 acres of land, and has an Ineome of £15,C00 0 0.
In pay and Tensions it rsoeives £621,000. The Estab-
lished Church has an income of £3,000,000 Of course
he would do away with both. Ha contrasts the £lO,OOO
whiob the President ot the United States costs, with
the £8)0,000 a year which our Royal family oosts Mr.
Laboucbora is a genuine Radical who does not go bask
on his opinions when the piuoh comes..
The natives of the territory adjacent to Liberia
on the West Coast of Africa, recently annexed by
Great Britain, have " invaded” their own country. We
don’t see how natives oan invade their native land, but
as the cablegrams say so, we suppose it is all right. The
British resident’s troops are resisting the "Rebels.”
We wonder now how a cablegram from native sources
would read. Something like this, perhaps:—” The
British have invaded onr country. The natives have
risen against the invaders. ‘ God save tho Bight I ’ ”
That’s all very well, but some rebels will most likely
be hung for resisting the authority of their ” lawful
sovereign.” Humph! We shall shortly hive the
Papuans "invading ” New Guinea. Wait!
That pleasant creature, O Donovan Rossa, who
keeps or mod to keep a low flve-cent whisky mill in
New York, has, we read, " been receiving congratula-
tions ” on the recent Fenian doings. Ha was recently
described as sitting in a room overhead in which was
the motto " Burn everything English, but England's
coal,” and as saying, in r» a recent explosion in London.
" I assume that the canister used in L mdon ia No. 18,
because it has an explosive power eighteen times greater
than the ordinary dynamite ** Another correspondent
says he saw on Bossa’s table several iron spheres of the
siza ot ooooanuts. They were bomba of a new American
patent. Each bore the name of the maker. He was
shown the correspondence, invoices, Sc o., offering to
fnrniah any amount of these destructive engines at a
short notioe for a dollar and a-half apiece.
Irish leaders like Mr. Parnell hare again and
again urged that it we pnt down open political agitations,
we shall find ourselves face t ~> face with secret societies.
Thii has been, says T ruth, the invariable case wherever
the attempt has been made. " Against the ‘ doctrine of
the dagger ’ Mr. Parnell opposes the ‘docTine of the
safety-valve ’ Because he has proved to be right, the
answer is that he is responsible for all the results of
the former ‘doctrine.’ This is tantamount to saying
that A must have robbed B, because he had told him
that if he aoted in a certain manner, he would lose his
property to U. I really believe that the main cause of
the hostility displayed by many newspapers against
Mr. Parnell, is that he has proved so absolutely right,
a ad they so absolute y wrong in their prognostications.
Either we must give to Ireland Homa Rale, or govern
her as a Crown eolony, and as the latter alternative is
impossible,' - the former must be accepted.”
A correspondent, writing to the daily papers,
wishes to know whether it would not be as wall for the
public benefit to insert si clause preventing the sale cf
intoxicating drinks to onr legislative members during
the time they are attending to tie business of tha
country, and sugges’s that during the hours of debate
tea asd ooff je should be ample for them. We object to
this suggestion. If it were carried into practice all the
colour aad vivacity would be taken out of Parliamen-
tary proceedings, and members weald treat each other
with the cold-blooded courtesy of ordinary gentlemen,
instead of in the spirited and stirring manner of
bullies in a taproom. They would " apologise for differ,
ing with their honourable friend,” and would “ really
think if he reconsidered the case his well-known acumen
would prove to him he was mistaken,” instead of tell-
ing him he was “ad d liar,” in the good old
straightforward way of the present time. They would
get through business with the same commonplace
promptness that ordinary business people do, instead
of with the dignified delay which should characterise
the representatives of the people. No, it would never
do. Besides, coffee, if too strong, has been known to
intoxicate members of Parliament before now. But if
such a measure is carried, there will be a sudden boom
in the sale of pocket-flasks.
Treating of the case of the Skye crofters, Pro-
fessor Blaokie of Edinburgh, has written to the Scots,
tmkn " Our sympathies lie emphatically with tha
1 iw-breakers. When the law is unjust, and the devil
so to speak, gits as God’s vicegerent on a local thrcnc,
it is nothing wonderful that rebellion should break out,
and that the rebels should in such oases b« not seldom
the very select and elect of the land. Such rebels wets
the Milanese, who revolted against the Austrian rule in
Lombardy, and drew out their lives sorro* fully in the
dark oells of Moravian prisons. Suoh rebels were onr
gallant forefathers —the men who fell at Bullion Green,
Aird’s Moss, and Bothnell Brig, and shod their blood
to purchase for us liberty to breathe on our own Soot,
tish soil and to read onr own Bibles witbont Anglican
dictation. Whatever deeds of blood were perpetrated
daring the whole seven and twenty years of Chari-s
the Second and hia pig-headed successor w re done with
the sanction of law; and, on a smaller and less bloody
field, the extirpation of the noble race ot mountain
peasantry that inhabited tbe onoe populous Highland
glens was done with the sanction of law. The law was
always in favour of the man who had tbe power; never
in favour of those whose natural weakness made them
an easy prey to the ambition, cupidity, or indifference
ot their superiors. The law could always be used to tn-
rioh the few, and to impoverish the many. Laws were
made with solemn show, and executed with unsparing
severity, to preserve tbe game, but never to preserve
the people ” Referring to these opinions, the t cotsm ih
says Nothing Mr. Parnell has ever written or said
has shown more ruthless disregard of tha test interests
of law and order, or been more calculated to incite to
intimidation, outrage, and murdsr.” Just so, a Coercion
Bill for Scotland will be needed directly; and after that
—why, a Coercion Bill for England!

arm. On teing examined while dying he confessed that
he had undertaken to shoot the Czar, but bis courage
bad failed him, and to escape his comrades’ vengeance
he had determined to commit suicide When the
Police Director begged the Emperor to be more careful
in future, he answered "I don’t care what I do in
future. Mere ohanoe saved me. None of you were
awueof what was going on.” In the editor's nom of
< ne of the Dnblin newspapers thsra is a telegram in a
mat frame, whioh was sent to the editor by a genius of a
reporter It reads as follows : " Pleas i keep ommn

This is how tha dummy dodge is worked in one
place, a selector gets his sister-in-law to take up a
640 acre block for him. She gives him a P N for £6OO
payable at the end ot five years. He pu f s £6lO worth of
improvements on in her name daring that time. She,
at the end of the terra, hands over the land to him, and
gets her bill back. It she refuses te deliver up the
land, he gets her £6OO, and is only £4O out of pocket.
At Hobart, George Ferguson, J.P., of Tinder-
box Bay, a wealthy farmer, who has tor years ill-treated
his wife, a delicate lady, has been bound over to keep
the peaoe. la the presence of friends, this ornament
to the Bench used language towards his wife toe dis-
gusting to repeat; "threatened to jump her to death
from her cheat to her back-bone, and only wished the
root was higher that ha oonH more effectually jump
her through and through He then struck her twice,
and turned her and her lady frienas out in a a almost
nude condition.”
A Northern Territory paper, on the authority of
Sirberland, the Afghan camel-keeper, says that the
soheol-book information on tho “ sh.p of the dosert "
is all bosh. The animal has only one stomach, n»t two;
and the story-book “ water-re leptacie ” is a fabrication.
Cam la don t carry water at all, though they can go
without it for a fortnight at a stretch. Taey are broken

look innocent, kick dreadful. Prom 4 cwt. to 500 lb.
is an average burden, 8001 b. being about the maximum

Near Gympie, tho other day, some as yet un-
discovered ruffians drove away nine horses (tom a
paddock into an adjoining stooa-jard and put the rails
up. Nine days afterwards the horses were found in a
terribly emanciated state, one ot the best of them, a
favourite and valuable stock horse, Iving dead at d half
devoured by native dogs. The horse’s tail was nibbled
at till it became raw, in fact, was partially gnawed off
by the other horses in their pangs of hunger. The poor
brute died evidently from want, and its body soon be-
came a feast for the dingoes.
Near Momalong, the other day, a fellow bailed
a selector np in his mansion, and fired seven ofa&rges ot
shot at him through the window, but didn’t hit him
onoe. When the selector came out, three revolver
shots were fired at him, but they also missed. The
shooting was done on account of a wages dispute—the
shooter alleging that after ho had been wonting four
months his employer refused to pay him a cent. On
the refusal, he went to Uraua, bougnt the firearms, and
went for his master, whose wife and children were in
the room when the ex-aervant fired through the win-
dow. The place was riddled with shoo. The shooter
gets three years' hard labour, but is, it is said, aym-
pathised with by the residents.
At Binalong, the once notorious resort of Gil-
bert, Bea Hall, and Co., there is an ‘ old resident” who
is still enthusiastic in bis sympathy for the " poor
bunted and persecuted highwaymen,” while he speaks
sneeringly of the police who “ shot poor Gilbert in tha
back." He gives an interesting narrative cf how tha
ammunition of the bushrangers had been damped by
one who onoe betrayed them into the hands of tha
police; how Gilbert bravely defended Linselt from
oehind an old tree that still stands in the creek as a
monament of the event, perforated with bullets; and
how his corpse was unceremoniously dropped into the
grave “ on yonder hill,” hewn out of the solid rook,
and on which grave it is said tue grass refuses to grow,
as a kind of revenge for this inhumanity I
A kauri tree, 18 ft. in diameter and over 40 ft. in
CToumferenoe, the lowest branch ot which is over 45
ft from the ground, is described by a N.Z. writer. The
trunk contains 43,752 feet of timber. Taking into con-
sideration all we anow ot the slow growth of N.Z trees
this tree may be 3000 years old, and at all a/wits is not
likely to be less than 200 J. Tniuk of 3000 years I Theu
this tree was a sapling m the wilds of Tararu whan the
Greeks were beleaguering the oily of Tro v. It was
gaining strength wnen boiomon dedicated i ha Temple
ot Jarusa em. .It was a tree when Bom ulus laid the
foundation ot the Eternal City. The mstory of Eng-
land, with all its raters—of Britons, Romans, Anglo-
Saxons—is but of yesterday compares with the life of
this tree, which stands yet apparently finished in
growth, but with no sign ot decay about it. as if it
could sec another 3000 years pass over its head.
A Public School-teacher went into a Bydal pub-
lic-house, the landiord of which be knew, and shouted
drinks tor three friends. The teacher called for ginger-
beer, but, as it was supplied from a cask instead ot a
bott.e, he would not have it, and ordered lemonade.
This was given him, and he then asked for •• a dash of
brandy.” The publican got angry, and told him te
didn't know what he wanted, whereupon the teacher
refused to have anything at all He paid tor what
his friends had drank, but refused to pay for what had
been tendered to himself. Ha did not di ink the lemon-
tide, a or did he even take the mm tier in his hands.
The publican thereupon gave him in charge me
new Licensing Act, and he was looked up in the cells
for five minutes. The pualiean did not proceed with
tha charge, and, on an action for falsa impiisonment,
the teacher recovered £lOO.
The brother of Mitchell, the man who was
mortally stabbed by taiibra Mott, has written to one of
the Armldale papers, saying that bis brother was neither
a coward nor a seducer, and repudiating the assertion
that the deceased, on becoming comparatively rich,
abandoned the girl whem he had proi eased to love when
he was poor. Mr. Mitchell points out that it has never
been proved that the girl was seduced. He adds that
she has been the unworthy objaot of a great deal of
spurious sympathy, which would not have bten forth-
coming were the public acquainted with the real facts
of the ease. Anyhow, it is a strange sat.ro on oor
morality that theia abonldiu this country be practically
no law for the punishment of seducers ; that the puoiio
should be ready at once to believe any woman who a »ys
•he has been seduced; and that it should allow a woman
whe, stung perhaps by mere jealousy, shoved a seven-
inch kmite into a man she wanted to marry, and Jet his
life-blood out, to have her revenge to the full merely on
condition that she serves a sentence uf less tnan one-
third the duration of that passed on a man who in
Queensland stole a horse the other day. Miss Milbra
N ott, finding that there was for her no nuptial knot, put
her head into tbs hangman’s knot, whereupon the
Goddess ef Justice —who m this country is a god
and has eyes (for a pretty woman; kindly out the

a gcod bank-balance and catch a woman making e\ ea ac

means a beauty, morally; that she made up her mind
to marry Mitchell, either for himself or for nis money j
and finding that she stood a poor show of having him
for her hnscand, she sharpened a knife ba k and .ront,
and, a week afterwards, plunged it into his breast and
left it sticking there. And now, in the minds of a lot
of people, this little murderess is more of a
heroine than the girl who woiks tor her living and bears

had been virtually defeated on the Coolie question and

afford to benefit any industry at the expense ot the

compatible with free Institutions; and he oonitnded
that they could not be confined to any class of labour.

Leos, by, Leolinua, an "Engliak sire imported to

ran a mile and a half in*tha Welter Handicap at tin
Christchurch Autumn meeting in 2 min. 42J sec, with
10 st 5 lb np. In the face of all our records —Dare bin’s
Derby, Welcome Jack’s last (treat performance, or
Tooal’s V.E C. Handicap in 2 3S with. 9st 4ib—they must
all surely stand aside if Loos did it with 10 st 5 lb in the
ti-'a reported. Is he not the greatest horse yet heard
of?
At the Auckland (N.Z) Autumn meeting,
Leonora, by Mr. Q. Q. Stead's imported sire, Leolinus,
out of Gossip, won the principal event; Normanby
being seoond, and Maori (late Auckland) third. Ten
started. Siesta, by Traducor out of Hammock, gob
home first in four of the sprint race’; Victoria, by
Feve Memento, appropriated the Mares’ Produce
Stakes; and the Steeplechase fell to Reform. The
country in tha latter race is said to be rougher than
that of Warrnambool.
The proposed raoe at MaiMand between Dick
Stevens and Cam’aadallo Billy didn’t come off, as the
sable flyer's friends wouldn’t go on with the match.
Stevens, therefore, took the blaokfellow's It
is net unlikely that the white will have a go at either
of the big guns—Farrell or Aplitt. The only thing that
prevents a match between these latter two Is the dim-
onlty of obtaining an enclosed greund. And there is
yec another Richmond in the field. A well-known rnnner
in Sydney named CKeeifeand Farrell were to have bean
matched, Callaghan’s conqueror laying £200 to £100 to
run 100 yards In Maitland; but. when it eame to putting
up the money, Farrell declined.
The lawn-tennis tournament on Saturday, at
the athletic sport*, played, for his Excellency's gratifl-
eition, in front of the stand, was about as interesting
to the majority of people as a peultry show, or a Peter
Campbell sermon. One of the contestants on the win-
ning side appeared to have but a single trouble —the
out of his pants. The attitudes ha struck between the
acts were sublime, and worthy of a Fighting Gladiator’s
statue, or of Jem Mace on th® pedeetal In nis classic
show. A considerable amount of wisdom was shown
by the committee in not suspending the races during
this desperate struggle; otherwise the ground would
have been cleared in less than no time.
In Lillywhito’s Crickiteb’s Companion for
1883 is ihe following, regarding Blaotham :—Just as
Murdoch is, perhaps, the best batsman, and Spollorth
probably the best bowler, so, in the opinion of very
many competent judges, is Blaokham the best wicket-
keeper in the world. He staada unrivalle i in the art
of stumping Not one of the famous wicket-keepers,
past or present, took the ball so quickly or so close to
♦he bails, and the great aehievements of Lookyer,
Pooler, Pinder, and Pilling are not equal to the deeds
of the famous Victorian cricketer, who, during his
three seasons in England, has honestly earned an un-
dying reputaio*. His bitting is still extremely useful,
and he is nearly always good for runs at a critical
moment.

An “ invisiblo spring-handle bat” has been
patented by Mr Bredie, of Richmond, Melb., with the
object of utilising and improving the large stook of
ordinary willow bats now lying useless in England.
Mr. Broflie hit upon the idea of bringing the dowell
principle into use with these cheap bats by running a
pliable hiekory or lauoewood rod through the centre of
the handle and well down into the blade, the result
being an article with driving power and durability equal
to the ordinary cane-handle bat, and with a reduction
of SO per cent, in tha cost of manufacture. During the
past tea»on, several leading cricketers, including Jesse
Hide, of South Australia, and Messrs. Horan, H’Donnell,
Bruce, and Swift, of Victoria, have used these bats, and
found them equal in propelling power to the ordinary
article, and even more durable.
The Melbourne Cup added money is this year
to be increased frem 500 to 1000 sovs —the seoond and
third horses to receive 800 and 200 sovs. respectively,
the final payment to be made at the scale, and the win-
ners of the V E.C. or the A J.O. Derbies to oarry not
lass than 7st. 5 lb. In several other events the amounts
have been increased and the distances altered. Con-
siderable alterations have also been made in the races
for New Tear’s Day, the most important of which is
the transposition of the Champion Stakes to the last
day of the Autumn meeting. The Bagot Plate, weight
for age, race for 250 sovs., one mils and a quarter, and
the Standish Plate, a handicap of 500 soya , one mile,
being substituted at the former meeting. We are
glad to see the deceased captain's name thus
commemorated. The Hurdle Race has been re-
duced from two and a holt miles to two miles. At the
Autumn meeting the Newmarket Handicap ia
to bo run in future on the first day The
added money in the Australian Cup is inoroared to 500
sovs.. seomd and third money to lOO sovs and 50 sova.
The B 3urke Handicap of 200 sovs., seven furlongs, is a
new item, and there are several increases of amounts,
and some alterations in the distances of the old events.
The Champion Baoe is the fourth event on the last day
of the Autumn meeting.
WHAT A HORSE THINK3.
Curious question this to be asked,
“ What a horse thinks ? "
As easy to answer that as this;
What a corse thinks I
A bush horse say, or else one of those
That they loan out.
Whose frame seems starting out of their skin
Bone by bone out P
A racer, eut by the spur and whip
With the crimson
Blood streaming out from his flanks, and white
Foam his limbs on P
A war horse, rushing in all his pride
To the battle
What thinks he when in his throat there sounds
The death.rattle P
A hearse horse, what does he think of his load—
Of their souls, say P
His opinion’s hardly as good, we guess.
As the mole's, say.
Wo pass—but we guess the horse thinks much
As the mass thinks—
But read a Bum leader, and you’ll know
What an ass thinks 1
How to lay out a Racing Track.—For a mile
track, a paddock of forty-two acres will do Draw a
line through the oblong centre, 440 yards in length,
setting a stake at each end. Then draw a line on either
side of the first lino exactly parallel with and 140 yeirds
from it, setting stakes at either end of them. Ton will
then have an oblong rectangle ['] 440 yards long and 280
yards wide At each end of tuese three lines you will
now set stakes. Now, then, fasten a cord or wire 140
yards long to the centre stake of vour parallelogra u, and
then describe a half circle, driving stakes as ofteoras
you wish to set a fence post. This half circle, com-
msnoing at one side and extending to the other, will
measure 440 yards. When the circle is made at both
ends of your parallelogram, yon wiU have two straight
sides that measure 440 yards each, and two oireles of
exactly the same length, which, measured three feet
from tha line, will bo enotly a mile. The turns should
be thrown up an inch to the foot. Half-mile track : —
Draw two parallel lines 600 feet long, and 452 feat 5
inches apart. Half way between the extreme ends of
the two parallel lines drive a stake, then loop a wire
around the stake long enough to reach either side.
Then make a true curve with tha wire, putting down a
stake as often as a fence post is needed. When this
operation is finished at both ends of the 600 foot parallel
lines, the track ia laid out. The inside fence will rest
exactly on the line drawn, but the track must measure
a half mile three feat from the fence. The turns should
be thrown up an lash to tha toot. The stretches may
fee anywhere from 45 to 60 feet wide.
The six days’ trudge between Edwards and
O’Leary terminated on Saturday night at eleven, when
Edwards bad covered 466 miles 2 laps against hla oppo-
nent's 459 miles. Edwards’ record, though it is, of
course, not to be named in the same breath with some
English and American performances, notably several
by this same O'Leary, is the best yet made in these
eolonies. O’Leary, having now been beaten twice con-
secutively by Edwards, on a comparatively low record,
is evidently walking downhill. Edwards, true, might
have somewhattincreased his distance had he not oeaaed
walking at ten o’clock, bnt then, as a matter of fact, he
did oease walking, and so his record stands as above.
The attendance during the week was large; some peo.
pie apparently camped all night in the building during
the progress of this moat melancholy exhibition of
peripatetic lameness. In fact, we are told by a man
who visited the plaon one morning at about a quarter to
four that eighty or ninety people were at ihat time
huddled up around the track. One or two priests
seemed to take an especial interest in the proceedings
—of coarse, on the side of O Leary, who, it was
rumoured, “had their blessing," and, this being the
ease, the greasy persons by whose shillings “ six-
day-walks ” are chiefly maintained hadn’t the
slightest difficulty in making the matter a Protes-
tant and Catholic concern. Walking in the name
of the Lord! Anyhow, if O’Leary did eo, the E. G.
ecclesiastical authorities were not on this occasion
infallible. Of course O’Leary came in for soma abuse
at 1 ha finish—losers of six-days’ walks are never popular
among the perfect gentlemen with red mufflers,
gorilla chins, and short clay pipes, whe back tnem.
Edwards as the winner of course takes the stakes, which
are supposed to be £SOO, and tke men divide between
them the gate-money, amounting to a good many
hundreds of pounds. It is said that seme capitalists
were foolish enough to back O’Leary for a very stiff
amount, and that they have been nipped to a rather
lively tuna, despite the fact that they laid off pound by
pound and half-sovereign by half-sovereign as much of
the money as they could induce the fanciers of the
“Melioanmau” to take up. We suppose there’ll be
another walk shortly, Thera generally is another walk
ahead.
SPORTING GLEANINGS.
At Thargomindah, recently, Perry alias Tioh-
borne | ran Mott, a local ped., 200 yards for £25
aside. Mott won easily by six yards in 23)880 At
Eureka, Kiama, there was a three-mile trotting matoh,
the other day, for £5O aside between Pike’s (Kiama)
chestnut mare and Dawes’ (Dapto) bay mare. The
former won by twenty lengths E. O. Bishop, a Tas-
manian ’oyollat, has ridden a hundred miles under
twelve hours. He travelled from Saakebank, 100}
miles from Hobart, to that oity, and did the distance

son, the light-weight, £25 to £lO in a wrestling contest.

able battle, he promised somebody that he would turn

his dogs were wounded. This is the kind of man we
like for a snooting companion At Mudgee, several
hundreds changed bands over the three-mile matoh be-

Mr. Stiff. Easper won easily...At Toowoomba, Lovell’s

200 yards, £25 aside. Turner went off with the lead,
was never caught, and won as ho liked all the way. A
matoh then took place between Turner and A Biggs,

proved his superiority by winning by tour yards. He is

A foggy morning is generally followed by a
sunny afternoon ; and all the ladies who know this faot
laid out their paraphernalia quite early last S iturday,
so as to be sura everything was right, for it was under,
stood there would bu great competition. So there was.
The plaids, of course, appeared in every colour and
size of pattern; warm velvets and homespuns prevailed
a good deal; so did princosse bonnets; but the para-
mount feature was the number of sqnare-toppod hats,
with a rim rolled up all round. They don't strike one
favourably at first glance; bnt they are no doubt full of
merit, or bo sure the ladies would not wear them. And
then there was an interesting resuscitation of that old
celebrity the crinoliae—or, to speak by the card, its
diminutive, the orinolinette—or, for convenience,
“ onnoletta.” It was very plentiful. It was more
plentiful than beautiful; and it was more prominent
than either. His Excellency, and Lady Loftns in black
satin and dolman trimmed with lemon colored fringe,
walked q uiotly onto tho ground about three o’clock, and
the Herman Baud announced them a tow minutes after-
wards Mrs. J. King was stately in a rich costume of
maroon combined with a brocaded pattern of lighter
hue. Three sisters were neat copies of one another,
all alike in black velvet, with jet and fringe trimming,
with lace collarettes, sable hats and snowy feathers.
Miss Cadell wore a nice brown cloth dress with watered
moire trimming, brown hat to match with a thick roll
of wasp-coloured plush. Bather noted waa a black
velvet costume, with light pink plush round eaob arm
at the shoulder, the bottom of the dress and back
draping edged with the same pink; cardinal hat with
same pink feathers : the effect was good. Mrs. Chute
wore a nice claret cashmere and prinoesse bonnet to
suit. A dull black, nicely made, was orewelled on the
breast and skirt with brightest colours, but it was too
tastefu’ly done to appear glaring. Mias Fyfa wore
cloth and lace of a rich brown, large buckles, and a
brown Fatiouco hat. A yellow-fawn cloth top dress
was edged with a row of tabs of old gold plush, the
skirt and hat tonohed off therewith. Mrs. J. Urqnhart
wore a very excellent garb; a pretty grey cloth but-
toned up left side of the breast, the skirc on came side
being out away obliquely to show a large wedge of noh
ruby velvet; tho sleeves, and a row of tabs round the
bottom of the grey skirt, being also of ruby velvet,
bodge of same on the hat. The costume was one of the
daintiest on the lawn. Miss Parry’s azure blue was
superb; Mrs. Steal's stylishly simple black cashmere
worthy of Worth ; grey check silk went with a sweet
face; and with hats, parasols and dresses all of the
same sombre shade as the aoe of spades, tbres neat
sisters looked perfect black belles. Miss M'Coy seemed
gay in a handsome green velvet, and sportive looking
hat to match. Mrs. Wya t’a costume was very rich, of
dark grass green poplin, with flowered satin and passe-
menterie trimming, nnder a brilliant parasol of
crushed strawberry satin. Two panier bodices of black
watered moirA with bliok cloth skirts, worn by sisters
under black plush hats, were neat and nice. One might
call Mrs. B Teeoe’s dress a mixture of moss green with
a shade darker, in cloth and velvet, the latter studded
with white bosses, which looked onrions. Then there
was a young lady whose entire dress was of that pure
and heavenly blue only to be found in Bignold’s eyes—
and in them only on posters; and another yonng He-
brew lady, from Cooma, in a blusy-browa plaid, who
did a oruel wrong to that town—by leaving it; and a
Band wick lady in a handsome dress whereof the body
was maroon velvet, and the skirt of that brownish
yellow seen in autumn leaves, with a maroon band.
Manvo velvet trimmed with passementerie was worn by
a lady whose cheeks were like those of David of oil—
while he was young and not giddy—that is, of a ruddy
hue, and goodly to look upon. A fawn satin and broahc
costume was also beautiful, and the lady had beauty
spots on her cheeks Mrs. Oarngati wore a
conspicuous oliret of figured velvet and satin, parasol
acme oolonr, and headdress of golden blessoms ; and as
several ladles in our vioinlty said it was a “ beautiful
dress," why lit must have been. Even more remark-
able was tuat of a tall bloida lady; of fine crimson
olaret satin, very large pouf and volnminona draping,
the underskirt of crushed strawberry pompalour satin,
small pieces of whioh were let in at the shoulders and
breast; very stylish crimson olaret hat, with pink
feather There were numerous eases of velvet tops and
cloth skirts to match ia oolonr, such as dirk green,
bine, or brown, some exoadingly handsome, yac not
showing any particular novelty.

The Hoapital Ball last Thursday, at Melons,
was a vary pleasant affair; spacious hall, good floor, a
more than passable quartet of stringed instrument
players, and a profusion of dainty refreshments helping
to make it so. 1 brilliant show of the youth and fashion
of the little town came dewn. and even the primmest of
tirim curates was there to take a turn in the mazv waltz
Dre sas were plain and fancy, and elegant. The young
lady who was unanimously voted belle was dressed a-<
Nancy i.ea ; while another, who, we believe represented
Oarne Lee. was certainly proxime accessit, and they
both danoad merri-lee. Other no'ioeable ladies were
dressed in a neatly made cream India muslin and deep
lace; ant a short black satin with cardinal tr-mmings,
ti Dancing terminated a v ont daylight on Friday
morning, and the Hospital it expected to resp a good
benefit.

Maitland fluttered somewhat, lately, owing to
the faot that Mr F, P. Sollingar, surveyor, was married
to Miss King, daughter of a squatter from the North,
who wore err am satin and brocade, blossoms and veil.
The bridesmaids, who were the principal’s sisters, and
two ladle* from Singleton and Otngera, wore—two, pink
nun’s veiling and raby satin; and two, cream non 8
veiling and heliotrope satin, caps to match About a
hundred were present at a ball in the evening, and
spent a happy time. Among the gay dressers, the wife
of a leading business man was seen in lavender brocaded
Bilk and flower cap; her daughter being charming in
cream satin, with red chrysanthemums in her hair and
down her dress. Another storekeeper’s fair daughter
wore cream satin and cardinal bows. Cream lace and
daisies, also pale bine silk and cream lace paniers,
looked nice. A Balmain girl, in white and blue, with
forget-me-nots, was a success; and the wife of St.
Mary’s organist seemed at her best in white satin, with
tartan sash and kilting. Bridesmaids, of oonrse, as
before—and to the (ere, as well.

Tl>6 Citizens’ Ball at Auokland, N.Z., to Sir
Wm- and Lady Jervois, was one of the most successful
assemblages of the kind ever held there, while the
decorations of the ha)!, it is said, were simply splondi l.
'Photo were 13'any rich and elegant dresses. Ladies
wero dressed in elegant styles. The costumes were
generally short, inclining to fullness. Most wore short
sleeves, bat low neokrd dressed were ia the minority.
Ia general the hair wis sirqp'y droites, vary few having
any flowers. A few ladies were very noticeable by
having tho hair drawn tightly np to the top of the
bead. There were vary few hand bouquets, and no
great display of jewalb ry. flowers being the ornament
chiefly used Lady Jersois wore a plum.coloured silk and
Prinoe.-s robe, with front of heliotrope satin; very leng
train, cream cap with lace ; and Miss Jervois an ivory
silk and satin with pink rosebuds. Miss Jennie Isaacs
!a relative of the Hon. Saul Samuel’s), was aoknow-
edged the belle, her dregs being a white satin, with
soarlet plush fittings and silver lace, and skirt em-
broidered with coloured beads. Mr. and Mrs. J. P.
Barnett (Jennie Lae) were among those present, both
bsing introduced to Sir William, who tripped it gaily
with the fair actress.

The Protestant Hall has seldom presented a
more gay appearance than it did on the night of the
Concert to Mr. and Mrs. Harry Woods. Almos ■ with-
out exception the ladies were elegantly attired, thougn
the wearing of trained dresses at a concert is not in
entire accord with the fitness of things. They can’t b J
displayed, and they m&k? rather expensive oarpets for
other people’s feet Mrs. Woods wore a quiet but
tasteful costume of cream and gold—a combination she
often adopts Signora Pabris was gorgeous in ruby
velvet and satin; nnd Mrs. Spencer, ia cream satin and
1 aoe, charming. Hair w*«rn high on the heed seemed to
be in favour, bnt the Grecian styles of beauties are
Ith to abandon their “neck knobs.'* The Misses
Middook, each in a different style, looked handsome in
ruby satin skirts, with pink satin overskirts, trimmed
with soft white laoe. A very young lady wore a pare white
satin dress, with broad tartan sash and trimmings, the
offset being uncommonly pretty Miss Want wanted
nothing more than her blaek velvet and pink roses to
set off her grace and state. Two sisters wore costumes
of browa velvet and gold passementerie—handsome
dresses. As Ashfleld lady, in ruby satin unrelieved by
anything: save a touch of cream lace on the neck and
sleeves, was lovely. It's undoubted that half sleeves
give a much more dressy appearanee than long ones,
but if a lady’s arms are—well, yon know, some people
Haile to wear long ones; or else, to take off the plainness,

Since the Italian Opera has been at the Gaiety,
fashionables have been drawn there, so there is some-
thing to bo said about the dresses. At the Gaiety they
can be seen—which they never can be in the ghostly twl-
light at the Boy air Signora Giorza, ever lovely, looked
still sc, the other night, in black silk with open lace
sleeves, coral ornaments on arms, neck, and head, and
the hair taken off the neck and fastened on the crown
with a coral pin. A dove.oolonred silk, with white
flowers at the throat and in the hair, looked neat. An
old-gold surah dress, oat square at the neck with short
sleeves, admirably became a dark beauty. The favourite
dresses for evening wear are black silk grenadines and
black satins, as with them any colours can be worn at
pleasure.

A fashionable wedding, for some time past on
the tapis, was performed at Lower Gundaroo last week,
between Mr. E. Barber, of Tass, son of a well-known
resident of that district, and Miss Adt-le Massy, of
•* Esthermend." Many of the squattocracy from
Goulburn, Yass, and elsewhere, were conspicuous
among the guests, and a jovial wool-man from Bywong
acted as best man. Charming was the bride in her
tasty attire, and the Misses Massy and Barber, her
maids, in theirs, were equally so. Ball, &c., at Mr.
C A. Massy's, “ Stoueville," at night, where a young
lady from “ Wynella,” Goulburn, a petite brunette
from Yass, and a lively demoiselle from “Nanama,"

Some fifty supporters of the Newtown Private
Skating Bins met for a kind of preliminary evening on
Monday, m the Oddfellows’ Hall there, with the object
of starting the club for the season. A good many
ladies were present, and after a whirl on the wheels, a
twirl on the toes finished the evening. The large
muster renders it pretty certain the club will be again
formed The Bnrwood Private Einkl was to have
started the following night, but, through a little error,
the hall was found to bo occupied by Mrs. Goold’s
dancers, and the skatists had not the heart to disturb
the lady’s pleasant little party. The proceedings, how-
ever, wl'l commence to-night (Thursday) in the large
Town Hall, and as the members’ list has rapidly filled
there is sure to be a gay gathering.

There was a Milbra Nott case in Paris the
other day. A young man walking with hit (lanes*, was
confronted by a youth, who said, “ Mademoiselle, your
intended is a scoundrel, who had a mistress, and de-
serted his child. Thus 1 disfigure him," and then
waled him heavily across the face, drawing blood each
blow. The assailant was arrested, and before the
magistrate, said; "I am a woman} he promised to
marry me, and then deserted me and my child. And 1
swore revenge." She was discharged.
Here’s an ides for Mayor Harris. Collecting
taxes in the Boumanian town of Vadulasti is nearly as
easy as that of balancing a Chinese insolvent's books.
Not long ago the Mayor of the Commune, finding all
other means of no avail, hit upon a plan which has
never been equalled since the Bape of the Sabines.
While ail the male population were at work in the fields,
his Worship swooped down with twenty subordinates,
and carried oil to a secure spot the wife of every house-
holder who had failed to pay up for his twelve months
gas and water. When the husbands returned they were
plnuged into profound grief, and, equally as a matter of
course, they adjourned to the nearest public-house, and
for three days indulged in brotherly sympathy in a
liquid form. At the end of that time, however, the
least drunk of the crowd seized the Lady Mayoress, and
as her husband happened to wear a wooden leg, and was
forced to avail himself of extraneous assistance to
undress, there was nothing left but to give the Vadulea-
tians back their wives, aud to let the civic affairs go to
smash, where they ate now.
An English writer on the ethics of taste is par-
ticularly severe on the small-waist disease. This is
what he says:—‘‘A small waist is only pretty when
harmonising with youthfalness and general slightness 3
but when tue shoulders spread above, and the hip* jut
out below, a small waist is nothing but a deformity, and
it is only because modern meo and women grow up ac-
customed to such departure from nature and grace of
line, that the deformity is not only tolerated but ad-
mired " So far we agree with him. It will, we are
modestly convinced, produce somewhat of a flatter
among marriageable young ladies to kaow that we pre-
fer a slight sylph-like figure, like the Mosidora, for in-
stance, to the latge-woisted though magnificent Venus
of Milo. But ws don’t prefer it wnen it has to be ob-
tained by going through a crushing machine. Fawn,
like elegance is vary much to onr fancy, as long as it is
not fictitious. But when a young lad? is afraid to
stoop lest like Peggotty in ‘ David Ooppetfleld,” the but-
tons should fly off the back of her dress, we think the
elegance is a little overstrained. And, nsnally, the
young lady, after all her martyrdom, is betrayed, when
she lifts her dress to cross a street, by her ankle*. Her
waist may be screwed in till there is hardly any visible
communication between the upper and lower halves of
the body, her feet may be pressed into a boot not too
large tor a baby, but it is a hard thing to compress the
ankle, and, as by his foot you could judge Hercules, so
can you Omphale from her ankles. We have seen
young ladies, whose breeding and education should
have taught them the differ euoe between deformity and
grace, going about the street with the upper part of
their body looking like a flat iron with the point down-
wards, and the lower part like a pear with the bntt-end
upwards. And now we shall quote to disagree, flays
the writer in question:—“ There is nothing to be siiu
against the taste of the savage when he decorates him-
self with shells and feathers. These things are bat
superadded, wholly distinct from his form, leaving the
man a specimen of the human being " Indeed ! And
what are carls, bangs, waves, and ail the other varieties
of artifioial hair; what are false teeth, basts, bustles,
and padding of all kinds but auperadditions P It there
were less of all these things, perhaps there would be
fewer marriages but certainly there would be fewer dis-
illusianments and divorces. Though as to the matter
of that, few men are long deoelved by these devices.
He is but a alow follow who [Stop here.—SJd.]
The following is an extract from the rules of
the Salvation Army for its officers aad effioeresses :—
1. Those who .flirt and are found out, which
is usually the cane, are seat home again.
2. Those who are proved guilty of wilful
jilting are dismissed in disgrace.
3. None are allowed to do any courting for
the first twelve months.
4. If at the end of that time any engagements
are formed, information to this effect must be
forwaided in confidence to the Qovernor.in-
Chief, who, if he approves, gives consent to
such engagements.
These are very pretty rules, and will, we have no doubt,
be carried out to the letter, when the members of the
Salvation Army become angels ; but not till then. We
should like to know, by the way, whether the first
means that it is usually the case for members to flirt
and be found out and sent home, or merely that when-
ever they do flirt they are found out. We reckon the
former; for, look you, as tar as women are concerned
anyhow, to flirt is to eat, drink, and live. When a
woman gives up flirting, it is a tacit admission that the
grave is her home. Very few women make this ad-
mission. And as for jilting, it is a natural consequence
of flirting; no woman can be expected to marry every
man she flirts with. It is the distinct privilege of a
woman to flirt and to jilt—and be jilted. The rule
about “ doing no courting (or the first twelve months"
is very funny; wo suppose it moans public and de-
monstrative courting. Otherwise, who ean tell P We
have seen very good courting in a pew; we were in the
pew at the time. One can court across a street by
kissing hands—for a while. Wc have courted with a
telephone, trade of a piece of string aad two jam-tins,
from the back window of one house to the back
window of the other; we have courted craning
over the top of a wall, by whispering down the
grating of a cellar, by interchanging pressure of toes
under a table, aud noboly was any the wiser, and,
though it was not just the real thing, it was near as we
could sot to it—until the old man’s gun was lost, and
we could defy him with impunity. Bah I love laughs
at locksmiths; locksmiths also laugh at love—especi-
ally if they have the contract for supplying the gaols.
Anyway, how the deuce could any engagements bo
found "at the end of that time"—the prohibited
twelvemoaths—if tke parties were not allowed to
court? Bat, when we come to consider these absurd-
looking rules a second time, we see at once that the
framer of them was a long-headed man, and a very
respectable student of human nature. He knew that if
the effiaera, male or female, of the Army were allowed to
make love to each other as much as they liked there
would be very little fun in it. So the artful old dog—
ws suppose he is old, seeing be knows so much—made
these restrictions, foreseeing, with a chuckle, what
bushels of fun the members would have in eluding
them. Just for the sake cf taking a hand in it, wo
have half a mind to join the Army ourselves. Only half
a mind, though, which oeuuta for nothing, as the other
is our batter half.
