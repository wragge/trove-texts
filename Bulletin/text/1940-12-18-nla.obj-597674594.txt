THE DREAMING WORLD.
A Sonnet Sequence.
1.
Because the world is asleep and no one can
break
Into her misty dream where her trees pro-
claim
Her dark-green will, and daffodils will not speak
The pure yellow word that broods on their
lips like flame,
We who have chosen to wake, we who have
chosen
To work in words have learned that we
wasted our breath:
Our hands drop down to our sides and our
lips are frozen,
And we learn in silence the speech of sleep
and death.
The dark world stirs in her sleep with a wave
of branches,
The thrush in the mist cries out like a girl
awaking,
And the stream by the willow whose timeless
thirst it quenches
Is one with the leaves above it gleaming
and shaking;
And I touch the tree with my hand and speak
to the stream
In a silence of ice and silver, like the babble of
dream.
2.
In the grassy street of the suburb the black
dog drowses,
Shrill children play, and neighbor gossips
to neighbor,
And deep in the dream of their hearts the little
houses
Are anchored in peace like hulks in the calm
of the harbor.
And now in a flood of sunlight at Double Bay
Where the boats are white on- the water and
gulls in the air,
The buildings crowd to a tower, and the primi-
tive clay
Is a man’s dream struck out of earth, all
golden and fair.
What deep dream, softer than feathers, greener
than grass,
More sparkling than water, stirs in the sleep-
ing earth,
That the trees, calm apparitions, should tower
and pass,
And out of its need the daffodils come to
birth:
All the green world, the shining phantasy, lies
In the mind of the earth, in her sweet dark
hidden eyes.
3.
At the end of the town where the road’s cold,
rocky river
Is sucked in the breakers of endless acres
of green,
A rill runs out of the swamp where the bul-
rushes shiver
And trills through the rusty weeds so
sparkling and clean
A bird could have sung it instead of that
marshy place. ,
Flat on his belly the boy by the crystal pool
Stares at the water as at a beloved face
And all his mind is suddenly shining and
cool.
Under the blackberry sticks on its way to the
wood
The Mangatoki twists like a silver chain
And winds in my mind and glitters and sings
in my blood,
And the water has spoken, the man has
answered again:
Delight to delight its clear salutation tells,
Talking in water as churches talk in bells.
4.
Perched on the wrinkled cherry the starling
quivers
And snaps his bright bill seeking a keener
song,
And down at the garden end the flax-bush
shivers
In its glory of honey and fire where all day
long
The restless black bells of the tuis are swaying
and singing.
And a child on the swing there sings to her-
self alone,
And neither the scarlet flowers nor the bird-
songs ringing
Nor any rill in its cress has so pure a tone.
On the calm air the child’s pure being breaks
In a white enchantment of song from the
flute of her lips;
And the wrinkled tree and the starling, the
blossoming flax
And the tui whose voice is gold with the
honey it sips
Are as close to the child as her voice, more
close than her name,
Speaking one shining language of song and
flame.
5.
Moira threw back her head and cried out my
name,
And the white birds of her breasts and the
swing of her thighs
Rushed into furthest dark, out of space, out
of time,
And we cried to each other there with iron
cries,
Lords of a kingdom not known to men awake.
And afterwards in the dreaming earth of
lovers
Our calm delight enfolded like a lake
The shade of trees and the cool thrust of
rivers.
After the fury, in love’s clear midnight sky
My shadows blaze with stars and like a
ship
Spreading her sails of light the moon goes by,
And I can taste all waters at' your lip
And touch all forests in shade of hair and
limb,
And live most richly then when life s most dim.
6.
Sometimes as when the bewildering surf of
snow
Like a frozen thunder beat on our quiet lands
And changed the earth so nowhere was good
to go,
All that we know, all we can touch with our
hands
Turns on us, mocks us, drives us home to
the hearth,
To the lonely heart where the blood like
firelight moves.
The cattle, lost like children, search for their
earth;
The whiteness is wild as earthquake under
their hooves.
This is the time when your knock like a roar
of rock
Clatters the neighbor’s house where the fire
was warm,
And a stranger, a dead man, breathes behind
the lock,
And will not open, and sends you away in
the storm.
This is the time when a man is so much alone
His friend is a madman, his girl is a hag of
the moon.
7.
This is the man who entertains us each
morning,
Collapsed on the path and feebly moving his
hands
Till the ambulance comes with its shriek of
despair and warning
And the crowd “moves on” at the constable’s
terse commands.
This is the man who stays in no man’s mind
And is whisked to the dark while the driver
is still explaining
The clear manoeuvres of fate, the Braille of
the blind,
To the constable’s book and the hopeful
idlers remaining.
Who if not you, who if not I is this,
Stricken by terrible chance to be one in a
city?
The workman high up, the scream hurtling down
the abyss,
The twitching white face the Judge com-
mends to God’s pity,
The headline, the photograph: who if not you,
if not I
For whom all young girls yearn, all mothers
sigh?
8.
The evening holds in its hand the darkening
cloud
And the fig-tree, wide as a forest, stretching
its branches,
And the soldier asleep, and the far-off roar of
the crowd,
And the harbor grave with dusk, and the
anchored launches.
On the slope of the evening turning towards
the night
The soldier is one with the leafy shadows
heaping
And the quiet grey water that mirrors the sea-
gull’s flight,
And the girl in his arms is the spring wind
curled and sleeping.
Now his heart is loud like the far-off crowd in
his ears.
O soldier, hold your girl close in your leafy
smother,
For not in your lifetime, not in these thunder-
ing years
Will grass be your sister again and rock be.
your brother
And your spirit be still with delight as a wheat-
field at noon.
The evening is closing its hand. The night
comes soon.
9.
Turning towards the night like a turning sleeper
The world is moving with all its darkening
dreams
Into a dream so immeasurably deeper
That stars are pebbles and time and space
are streams
And the racing waters cry out in words of light.
The boy could sing with the rill in the golden
summer,
But who in the crash and blaze of starry night
Can fill his throat with the towering cry of
its dreamer?
Yet I have stood at evening and watched the
world,
With the slow grace of a pebble in water,
sink
In the great dream. And space closed over and
swirled.
And drinking the silence upon that silver
brink
My stillness welled to a cry I could not speak—
So sweet was the dream—for fear the dreamer
wake.

Dear Messrs. Nicholson and Watson, —
How nice to hear from you. And how
are Mrs. Nicholson and Mrs. Watson,
and the little Nicholsons and all the
sons of Wat? May we wish you a
Merry Christmas?
We are writing, of course, in response
to your somewhat surprising but very
welcome invitation on the last page of
Ben Hecht’s A Book of Miracles : —
There are three people interested in
this book —the author, the publisher and
the reader. Contact, then, has been estab-
lished between three strangers. Will you
help us to make this contact a more last-
ing one by writing to us? If you have
enjoyed this book, it would be an en-
couragement to hear of it. If it has failed
to entertain you, we should welcome your
criticisms.
Our address is
Nicholson and Watson, Limited,
7 Paternoster Row, London, E.C.4.
How are you, strangers? Do send us
a photograph when you reply to this
letter so that we can really get to know
you.
Well, we enjoyed A Book of Miracles
very much indeed, thank you. We got
just a little bit tired of Ben Hecht’s
sermonising (for, under all his humor
and ingenuity and toughness there’s the
soul of a parson in Ben ; and all that
stuff about Capitalism and Democracy
and Uncle Sam —like Florence Nightin-
gale—as the last lamp of civilisation,
though it’s all true, is said too darned
often these days), but we’ll admit that
Ben gilds the pill so amusingly and so
imaginatively that it’s a pleasure to
swallow it.
Maybe, brothers, you’d pass the word
on to Ben that two bits of sermonising
that particularly tried our patience were
his long introduction to his story about
the Jews, “The Little Candle,” and some
of the musings of Professor Emmett
(when he was an ant) on the needle of
nobility in the -haystack of human folly.
But don’t get us wrong, for we admit
that the description of the prolonged
horror of the Jews as they opened their
papers each morning to read some new
outrage to their race, the analysis of their
shame, their agony and their invincible
faith in the future was worth putting
down ; and, apart from that, the ironical
conclusion where the Rabbi, condemning
God and blaming the Jews’ faith for
their misfortunes, hangs himself, only
to have his death taken as a miracle
confirming the Jews in their faith and
their high destiny, is worthy of De
Maupassant.
We’ll admit, too, old tops, that “The
Adventures of Professor Emmett” is an
outstanding short story ; the little pro-
fessor, secretly hating life and longing
for death, indifferent to his wife and
interested only in his beetles, is sketched
to the life; and Ben’s frank use of
psycho-analysis is for about the first
time since psycho-analysis invaded litera-
ture —both useful and attractive as a fic-
tional device. Then when Professor
Emmett, retaining his human mentality,
becomes an ant —one of those whose sole
purpose in life is to mate —Ben handles
him superbly. That moment when he
crouches in the grass while “the great
cloud” of a spider passes over him, trail-
ing the “forest of its legs”! Really it’s a
pity that with such a situation Ben wasn’t
a bit more ribald, but he acquires merit
all thp same for keeping the professor
in character. Ben’s fundamental idea
here is good, too: the professor hating
men and admiring ants; then, as an
ant, hating ants and learning to admire
men.
Now, what about the rest of it? Well,
none of those stories about angels and
the Deity offended us at all, though they
might some readers. What interested us
was the realisation that Ben would have
been burned at the stake in the Middle
Ages for any one of them, and that it
is just that fact that made Ben write
them. He wants to find out what is
wrong with religion, or what is wrong
with men, that the outcome of all ideas
and all ideals has been bloodshed and
torture. When he suspects that religion
is wrong he’s just an outspoken as when
he blames man, which seems fair enough.
We’ll agree that he doesn’t mean his
humor to be offensive.
We liked ’em all, friends. The one
about Joe Feeney who fell into molten
steel and whose soul was imprisoned in a
girder, thereby greatly baffling two angels
who had been sent down to carry it to
heaven ; the one about the film star who
was to play the crucifixion and was
snatched up into heaven and, on his
return, was thought to be mad ; the one
about the Angel Michael sent to earth
as a redeemer and deciding that no
spectacular redemption was possible but
that mankind’s infinitely slow progress
towards goodness was worth an angel’s
sharing—they’re all as brilliant as they
are unusual.
That’ll be all for today, Mr. Nicholson,
Mr. Watson. There’s nothing like the
personal touch, is there? We hope
you’ve liked getting to know us, and our
address is 252 George-street, Sydney,
Australia.
Would you, by the way, care to swap
stamps with us?
Justified Fiction.
“Mr. Brett Young has had this story
in mind for many years: most oppor-
tunely he has published it now.” Thus
the blurbist, of Francis Brett Young’s
Mr. Lucton’s Freedom (Heinemann). It
means that Mr. Young has come out in
open competition with the writers of
sentimental romantic escape fiction;
painting a lovely blue sky without a
shadow of cloud on it; something bright
and cheerful; jolly good fun and all that
sort of thing, to take people’s minds off
the grim realities attending them —and,
heaven knows, if this novel or any other
could do that in England now it would
be well justified.
It might be held by the chromium-
pated that Mr. Young never writes other
than escape fiction. Those who, liking
their meat raw and dripping and, pref-
erably, dragged a few blocks along the
pavement on a string, would thus classify
his City of Gold, and accordingly dis-
miss him from their stark Olympus—
these, it must be admitted, have really
seen nothing of him yet. His latest novel
is openly labelled escapist, and the term
is to be accepted in the Sunday supple-
ment or Hollywooden sense. It is as far
removed from the strident harsh as a
bowl of poppies. Go closer to the bowl
and find they are made of crinkly paper,
and that is how Mr. Young looks in this
astonishing appearance.
Even so, on the terms that have been
stated, his novel would be fairly justi-
fied just now if it performed the escapist
trick for any considerable section of the
public to which it is implicitly dedicated
—the English people in their grim setting
of total war. But surely a City of Gold,
lifting them off to a past South Africa
on a carpet that is not without magic,
would be the right sort of novel to per-
form that laudable service. Short of
the chromium-minded, anyone could read
that, and sundry other of Mr. Young’s
novels, and be carried away by his prose,
his splendid landscapes and his living
human beings. Mr. Lucton’s Freedom
could perform the trick for a limited
section at the most —for the more senti-
mental and romantic of England’s har-
assed businessmen getting on for the
sixties.
Its hero—for it is most insistently a
novel with a hero, though Mr. Lucton
is precisely as far removed from the
heroic as the Sydney “Sun” or London
“Daily Express” cartoon concept of a
representative everyman —is a successful
head of a firm of accountants, his own
romantic yearnings for escape stirred by
a hard-headed son who is gradually tak-
ing charge of the business, a “modem”
daughter who shocks her dear old dad
by leaving works on contraception lying
about the house, and a wife who has
joined these two in a conspiracy to sell
out the dear old home, no longer good
enough for them, and set up house on
a grander scale, with a separate bath for
each of them and for every possible
probable potential visitor as well.
Thus harassed, Mr. Lucton one day
gets into his Pearce-Tregaron and drives
into the English country, heading west.
Providentially, the Pearce-Tregaron takes
a header into a flooded stream, Mr. Luc-
ton escaping with acrobatic alacrity.
Having been paid a few thousand in cash
for the old home just before setting out,
he has a vast roll in his wallet, and the
idea occurs to him to vanish for a while.
So he helps gather hay, hikes in the
mountains, sleeps most .blissfully and
platonically under the open heavens with
a delightful hikeress, snuggling her close
to him to keep her warm, and eventually
passes on the balance of his roll to a
couple of old village maids who have
befriended him. Then he returns home
a new man. Very, very pretty.
Messrs. Macmillan also feel impelled
by the war to justify Hugh Walpoles
The Bright Pavilions: “At the time of
this chronicle England was as grimly
faced by the enemy as she is now; this is
an appropriate moment for the novels

appearance.” As .Mr. Young may be said
to compete with the Dells (and, in the
expressive language of the director of
Melbourne Art Gallery, “lick the pants
off them”), Mr. Walpole’s competitive
affinity is Jeffery Farnol. The sixteenth-
century England in which he suddenly
discovers one of the muscular branch of
his Herries family seated astride the
superb mare Juno would be pure Farnol
country if Mr. Farnol had ever deigned
to glance at the coarser aspects of it
which Mr. Walpole includes, with con-
siderable relish. Nick Herries and his
stage-Hamlet brother Robin are Farnol
people only slightly removed—Nick the
doughty doer, Robin’s protector, though
unable in the long run to save him from
the rack of those sectarian times. The
women are even more Farnolish, and the
plot likewise.
This last arises from the happy pen-
chant heroes like Nick in that day had
for helping authors like Mr. Walpole in
this. They fought, as Nick straightway
proceeds to do, sword-and-dagger fights
without finishing off their adversaries;
just nick ’em, so to speak, and let ’em go.
This left Hate personified stalking the
land, threatening to call again accom-
panied by Nemesis, a most useful
arrangement, presenting the author with
the boon of ready-made suspense. One
of Nick’s spared opponents puts the
matter in a nutshell: “You have spared
my life. That is not easy to forgive.”
The story lasts from when Nick spares
the villain till he eventually, in a fair
fight, kills the double-dyed scoundrel,
lifts his carcass head-high and heaves
him into a near-by waterhole. Hear,
hear, Mr. Walpole ; the dirty dog de-
served to die!
Farnolish resemblances notwithstand-
ing, it’s a meaty novel. The blurbist, in
fact, calls it grim, and Mr. Walpole
might even be said to go out of his
way at times to live up to that label. He
shows about as brutal a death as could
be imagined in his first chapter ; he gives
the most intimate depiction of Robin’s
death throes on the rack ; a close-up of
a dagger going into a farmer’s belly ; and
so much more of the same intimate sort
that if it could not be justified in such
a period piece on literary grounds it
might be worth looking into on others.
At all events, it adds up to a much more
vigorous novel than most in Mr. Wal-
pole’s list.
No attempt at justification accom-
panies Ernest Raymond’s A Song of the
Tide (Cassell; Angus and Robertson),
but one could well have been advanced,
for the novel is set in present, or rather
very recent, London; the tide is the
surge of London life ; and the depictions
of London about the bridges are as mag-
nificent and memorable as anything Mr.
Raymond has managed. The novel other-
wise will be fully described to those who
know the author if it is said that it is of
a piece with We, the Accused. Without
being, on the whole, so good a novel as
that, it has its own power. It is set in
the part of London which Londoners
know as the Surrey Side, and this, as with
all Mr. Raymond’s work, is most care-
fully and convincingly depicted.
The strength of the novel is not, where
Mr. Raymond no doubt intended to have
it, in the latter part, but in the first half
and perhaps a little beyond. It is here,
of course, that Mr. Raymond is building
up his setting, and this he does, as usual,
superbly. He is also bringing in his
characters, and, particularly in the very
early stages, it is no great critical extra-
vagance to see Dickensian qualities in
some of them. But though his early set-
ting, too, has much of the same high
quality, he falls far short of the great
Londoner—and, it should be said, of
himself elsewhere—in the construction of
his story. It does not build up on an
expanding pattern ; it tapers away. The
spread is all in the first part; it thins
out to a still well-told but rather com-
monplace story of a misfit marriage.
London and all in it are practically for-
gotten ; there are two persons in the
whole of it, for the outside lover who
upsets the marriage, and so wrecks it in
a shoddy little domestic tragedy, is no
more than a shadow.
But, though that fading away is cer-
tainly disappointing, and though the
number of discursive asides suggests that
the author is himself conscious of the
thinness of his tale, it would be a sour
reader who could not get considerable
literary satisfaction out of the magnifi-
cent first half. The setting therein de-
picted js favored at the moment as read-
ing by a strong topical interest, but it
would be grand reading at any time, even
if none of that setting had been blasted
into oblivion, or slow Decay, whom the
author personifies as a grey figure un-
hurriedly working there," had not him-
self suddenly become a casualty to Blitz-
krieg urgency.
Mark Twain in New Zealand .
It was in Timaru, New Zealand, that I
first met Mark Twain.
What brought him to New Zealand
and Australia is an interesting story. He
had been a sleeping partner in a New
York publishing firm which failed for
about 100,000 dollars. Mark Twain had
nothing to do with the direction of the
firm’s business: he merely invested his
money in the concern, but when Webster
and Co. was made bankrupt he shoul-
dered all its liabilities and toured the
world on a lecturing adventure in order
to pay all its debts, which he suc-
ceeded in doing.
When he lectured in Timaru he was
well over 60 years of age. He had a
Roman nose, piercing black eyes, a shock
of longish white hair, and he never
smiled.
Here is what I remember of the lec-
ture :
“When I was a boy I lived in a small
town in Missouri.
“My father was the coroner.
“It wasn’t a good business in that
town . . . People were very inconsiderate
—nearly starved my poor father to
death , . . Although nearly everybody in
the town was more dead than alive, still
there were very few actual deaths there.
“Well, my father had an office in the
town where the corpses used to be put
—when he had to sit on ’em. And some-
times, when I got home late and didn’t
think it was good to go home, I used
to spend the night on the sofa in father’s
little office.
“Well, one mornin’ I had a look out of
the window as usual, and made out it
wasn’t good school weather. It was too
wet to go to school . . . and just wet
enough to go fishing.
“Now there was a bad boy in that
town called Huck Finn . . . and we
weren’t allowed to play with him.
“So we played with him.
“It was only because Adam was for-
bidden to eat the apple that he ate it.
“I’ve always thought it was a pity he
hadn’t been forbidden to eat the ser-
pent ... because he’d have finished it all
right.
“Well, we went out fishing all day, and
I got home pretty late. Of course there
was no reason why I shouldn’t go home,
but I just reckoned I wouldn’t.
“Guessed I’d spend the night on the
sofa in father’s little office and wait till
things cooled off a bit at home.
“Well, as it happened, a man had been
killed that day in a fight with bowie-
knives, and the body had been stripped
to the waist and laid on the floor in
father’s little office.
“Of course, I didn’t know anything
about this. I started right in and lay
down on the sofa. Pretty soon I began
to feel there was something in the room,
and I got mighty frightened.
“Turned with my face to the wall and
tried to count a hundred. But you can t
count a hundred under those circum-
stances.
“When you get up to about sixty-five
you think it’s cornin’ at yer.
“At last the moon got up . . . shone
through the window . . . climbed along
the floor up the man’s legs, till it
showed the awful wound in his breast.
“I went away from there ...
“I don’t mean I went in a hurry.
“I just went —through the window.
Took the sash with me . . . not because
I wanted the sash . . . But it was easier to
take it than leave it.
“Soon after that I went down to
Nevada, silvermining.
“There was the most extraordinary
collection of human beings in that mining
camp you ever saw in your life. Stage-
coach robbers, murderers, cutthroats,
lawyers, liars.
“But there was one thing I did admire,
and that was the Mexican roughriders.
“So I made up my mind I was goin’
to be a Mexican roughrider.
“Now if you want to be a rough-
rider you’ve got to get a horse. So 1
started down town to an auction sale of
horses.
“Just as I arrived a horse was put up
and somebody bid five dollars for him.
A man standing next to me said, ‘Waal,
stranger, it does seem a cryin’ shame to
see a magnificent animal like that goin’
for five dollars.’
“ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘I was thinkin’ the
same meself.’
“ ‘Waal, stranger, you can’t do better
than buy that hoss. Oh, I know him...
He’s a real Mexican plug.’
“I didn’t know what a Mexican plug
was, but I reckoned it was somethin’
good from the way he said it.
“This was the auctioneer’s brother.
“I didn’t know he was the auctioneer’s
brother. He wasn’t a communicative
man at all. He didn’t tell me he was the
auctioneer’s brother. So I bid twenty
dollars for the horse—pretty eagerly.
“I got him.
“Well, the next thing to do was to
get two men to sit on his head and two
to sit on his tail while I got up.
“As soon as I was seated in the saddle
he doubled himself up and shot me into
the air.
“I dunno how high I went, but it must
have been a good way, ’cause I saw
some birds up there I’d never seen before.
“Then he stood up straight on his
hind legs ; then he stood on his toenails.
“That horse showed me everything
he’d ever learned from the earliest days
of his childhood.
“And when he got tired of that he
doubled himself up again . . . shot me
into the air again ... and when I was
up there someone must have hit him a
cut on the flank with a whip.
“Because when I came down again—he
was g0ne....”
And so on. We had two hours of that
delightful fooling. And afterwards in
the Grosvenor Hotel I had a further two
hours of it in a smoking-room conver-
sation with the humorist who never
smiled.

Angus and Robertson’s contribution
to the Christmas spirit this year consists
of a series of books for youngsters, large
and colorful in design and commendably
Australian in material. Two for Tommy
by lon Idriess (he’s a welcome addition to
the uncle brigade) are Head Hunters of
the Coral Sea, adventures of two white
boys among the islanders, and The Great
Trek, two Australian boys in an epic of
exploration ; both stories based on fact.
Norman Ellison’s Daredevils of the
Skies, about Australian airmen, should
be another winner. Two old friends,
both masterpieces in their way, are re-
published in the series: M. G. Skipper’s
“jungle book” The Meeting Pool and
Norman Lindsay’s The Magic Pudding.
Other titles in this series are Blinky Bill
Joins the Army and The Adventures of
Blinky Bill, by Dorothy Wall; The
Adventures of Snuggle pot and Cuddle-
pie, by May Gibbs ; Bumper Book of
Stories and Pictorial Crossword Puzzles
for Children, by John Tombs ; The Pixie
O’Harris Story Book. Associated News-
papers, Sydney, has published Ginger
Meggs Sunbeams Book ("series 17), 32
pages in color.
More Sketches of Kenya : Lord Baden-
Powell (Macmillan). Another breezy lot
of outdoor sketches for boys, particularly
Scouts.
Invasion: John Wallace (Popular
Publications). German spies in Aus-
tralia ; ’planes and excitements. Typical
Wallace.
Central Stores: Vicki Baum (Bles). In
the author’s Grand Hotel manner. This
time it’s a big store in the U.S.A. Quite
passable fiction.
Danger Road: Mark Saxton (Heine-
man). German spies in the U.S.A.,
though not the main concern, which has
to do with the brisk adventures of a
young chap on the trail of his mys-
teriously-vanished father. As lively as
such things are written.
The Hill Is Mine: Maurice Walsh
(Angus and Robertson). All the way from
Gahd’s Own Country to Scotland goes
a young American to a wee bit o’ land
he’s inherited, and there learns the art
of poaching and ends up marrying a
lovely lady.
Random Jottings of a Horseman:
Lieut.-Col. Sidney G. Goldschmidt
(Country Life). General horse lore,
hunting and the like, illustrated with re-
productions of Leech’s “Punch” draw-
ings.
Standard Stones from the Operas:
Gladys Davidson (Werner Laurie). A
note from the publisher states that the
author’s previous vol. has for many years
been the standard book on the subject and
has sold upwards of 70,000 copies. Here
she tells, competently and concisely, the
stories of some 50 more operas, less
familiar ones, with biographical notes
on the composers and page illustrations
by L. R. Brightwell.
The Chosen: Edith Simon (Bodley
Head). Using an involved but effective
narrative method, a young author here
faces up to the difficult job of not only
giving a living reality to the story of
Moses but of also giving it a fresh and
engaging interest. She succeeds beyond
all expectation; subsidiary characters
especially—a storyteller who makes the
main linking thread of the narrative,
one of the wives of Moses, and other
fictional and Biblical people—live as posi-
tively as if the author had been depict-
ing the contemporary lot of the Chosen,
a subject for an epic.
Various Verse
England—Now.
I remember them all —
The cool lanes and the leaning towers
Of lilac foxgloves and the flowers
Of the wild-parsley pale and tall.
Oh I remember down the wind
The stealthy fall
Of blown, pink roses,
And the cuckoo’s call
In the deep, green alleys.
But now from the sky where no song-lark
dallies
They are dropping death in the beautiful valleys.
O dear, lost valleys that I knew!
O nestling grey-roofed places
Where the placid country people walked
With cheerful, homely faces;
Where the muffled beat of passing time
Was only marked by the church-bell’s chime.
It is all gone now.
The thick dark rallies,
Sweetness lies black on the bough.
They are dropping death in the beautiful valleys,
VICTORIA.

And Yet...
The light winds of the forest
Have lifted me above
The reach of men and mortals
And given me their love:
And they are tender truly
As any temple dove.
And glad am I for freedom
From mortal moil and strain,
And yet I long to measure
The human heart again:
And hope against all hoping,
And dream against all pain.

A Gaffer on Springs.
The sprigs are sprouting now for spring
As long, ah, long ago,
When enterprise in blossoming
Was no exclusive kind of thing
For trees alone to know.
Yes; I was then a budder, too—
The leaves and I together grew.
But, in my corpulence of years
(Contemptuous of buds)
Complacency would strip her gears
And jar my soul to jealous tears
As willows, oaks and spuds
Portray in verdant plenitude
The benison of being renewed.
The Irrecoverable Day
Gay cavalcades of bloom
Recall to give old age dismay
And mock its weary downward way
Through solitude and gloom;
Till gaffers, goaded, rush to rhyme
With poignant paeans on their prime.
I therefore, carping in my cups,
Grow garrulous and grim,
To brood on seasons’ downs and ups
And see in pods pretending pups;
Till, fed up to the brim,
Beneath indignant feet I crunch
The shallots of the counter-lunch.
Not (so colloquialism rides
Roughshod o’er diction pure
Discountenanced —save wit abides)
In these unmentionable strides
Shall flesh and blood endure
The reprehensible offence
Of grudging age due reverence.
Avaunt then, all perennial fluff!
Blow up, O wintry blast!
In frosty browsings sterner stuff
Shall sobs eschew and choose the rough
And rugged to the last:
As stands the kauri pine serene,
And bold, and old, and ever green.

Breakdown.
Valentine the conjuror,
When the halls applauded him,
Cried out in his hastiness
That life had defrauded him.
Fie measured the glittering
Ephemeral rewards,
And fled to the country,
Unarmed against its swords.
No cheering, no clamor,
This laboring allows,
Where Valentine the conjuror
Is bringing in the cows;
But still through the night-time
Some terror will peep,
And the hands of a stranger
(Himself as a stranger)
Will trouble his sleep.

Drought.
The great heath shudders,
Koolamons are drained,
Billabongs go walkabout;
Moons since it rained.
Stone man gathers
For corroboree,
Chants harsh word-shapes
To narrow melody.
Parrot-feather images
Of blood and sweat
Weave their antic ritual
Which the whites forget.
Bull-roarer calls them —
Warriors thirsty-lipped,
Dancing fire-enchanted
Through the eucalypt,
Serve a timeless priesthood,
Final rpystery,
Making magic rainstorms
By corroboree.

THE MIRACLE
BY KYLIE TENNANT
A SHORT STORY
by
THE PRIOR PRIZE WINNER.
THE chaplain of the Military Hospital regarded
George Orr as a disheartening kind of invalid.
After all, a man who had spent most of twenty
years on his back, playing touch and go with
the Beyond, should be more receptive to words of
good cheer. Once or twice he had tried a “word
in season” (as he put it). He had touched on Faith,
he had even spoken of miracles ; but the look in
George’s eye had dried up his cheerfulness, had even,
he felt, done not a little to
diminish the wellsprings of
his own belief that all was
as it should be.
George said nothing.
He just lay there and
thought. Never of the future
nor the present, always of
the past. Whenever he felt
fit to walk he would hobble
off to see his friend, the
barman at the Royal Wind-
sor. Not to drink, for he
never ordered more than lemonade, just to talk ; and his
talk never shifted from the one subject, from the farm
where he had been born, where he had lived his life
until he went to the war. Nothing interested him
except that farm. His eye would light up, his face
would lose the grim lines, as he talked about the home-
stead that his grandfather had built and his father
had battled to keep going.
His friend Joe, the barman, a big, silent man,
would polish glasses in his slack time and listen to
tales of George’s old home without really healing
anything. He knew it did George good to talk.
“You never went back?” he asked once.
“What good ’ud it be?” George had replied.
“The brother had the place five years, then he was
burnt out. They had to sell the stock for what they
could get. There wasn’t a stick of the place standing
when they got the fire out.” From beneath his coat
he pulled an old faded photograph. “This was taken
when I was a kid.” He laid it lovingly on the bar.
“You can see it’s all built by hand. Gran’pa felled
the trees and he and Dad went at them with an
adze. Built it themselves, see? Every bit.”
The photograph showed one of those ugly, roomy
dwellings with a verandah in front and an iron roof.
It stood on a little rise. The photographer had
seemingly concentrated all his skill on the fence,
which showed up much better than the house. It
was rather a photograph of a wooden fence with
some kind of house behind it than a photograph of
a house. George regarded it with affectionate pride.
“You can see a bit of the shed,” he pointed out.
“There at the back. And the fowlhouse.”
“Yeah,” said Joe thoughtfully. “Getting a bit
faded, isn’t she?”
George took up his treasure and folded it away
in its paper jealously. “Thirty years,” he said. “It’s
pretty good for thirty-odd years. And it’s all I got
to remember the place by.” A kind of panic came
into his face. “Don’t think she’ll fade right out,
do you?”
Joe hastened to assure him that “she” wouldn’t
fade out.
“Last my time anyway,” George nodded. “Don’t
suppose it’ll be long.” He smiled a little bitterly.
“And there ain’t no one will want it after.”
When George had gone Joe went thoughtfully
over to his “tick” list. Beside the name of Sandy
Wilberforce was a total that made Joe shake his head.
Sandy was always “scoring-up” drinks in a persuasive,
careless way and forgetting to pay for them. He
had a perpetual drought and an ever-ready flow of
excuses. As Joe regarded that score an idea came
to him. He had never before greeted Sandy with
any affability when he came into the bar; but even
Sandy noticed the chill when, late in the afternoon,
he “dropped in for a pint.” Joe only pointed to the
score and shook his head.
“Now, listen, Joe,” Sandy began persuasively.
“How long have I been telling you that I’m at work
on the picture of the year?” He repeated it impres-
sively. “The picture of the year.” He waved his
hand as though erasing that ominous score. “It will
be hung—and hung well.” Joe shook his head.
“Think,” Sandy pleaded. “Refusing a miserable beer
to a man who”
“So you think you’re an artist?” Joe asked
deliberately.
Sandy straightened his necktie, a shabby and dis-
reputable necktie. “I know it,” he said with con-
fidence. “And when I have painted the Picture of
the Year”
Joe said firmly : “Never mind that. I’ve got
a job for you.”
Sandy’s face fell. “I’m busy on this picture”
“Never mind about that.” Joe jerked his thumb
at the score of unpaid beers. “You’re going to work
that off, see?”
“How d’you mean?” Sandy inquired suspiciously.
“You’re going to paint me a picture.” Sandy
began to protest, but Joe went on sternly: “You’re
going to do a picture from an old photograph. Ain’t
much to ask, is it?”
Sandy considered. “Well, let’s see it.”
“I’ve got to get it off the cove that owns it first.”
Sandy watched him thirstily as he poured out a mug
and set it on the bar. “Yes or no?”
“Yes,” Sandy muttered, reaching quickly for the
beer. It won’t matter much, he told himself. An
hour’s work retouching an old print. Sandy did a
lot of retouching for photographers. “Sure, Joe,”
he said winningly. “Only too glad.”
“A real picture,” Joe bargained. “An oil paint-
ing.” They haggled a little over who would pay
for the paints and canvas. “And none of your picture-
of-the-year business,” Joe growled. “I want a dinkum
picture of this here old house. This chap I’m telling
you about, he ain’t got nothing but that old photo.,
and if you muck it up, look out, that’s all.”
“Trust me,” Sandy assured him.
“I don’t. That’s why I’m gonna tell you just
how it’s got to be done. See?”
Sandy saw.
JZ) ORROWING the photograph from its owner was
—' a tougher job than Joe had anticipated. George
seemed to think that Joe had some designs on his
treasure.
“What d’you want it for?”
“Know a cove ’ull give it a coat of varnish to
preserve her,” Joe lied. “So she won’t fade any
more.”
With reluctance George relinquished the photo-
graph. He watched anxiously as Joe wrapped it up
and laid it beside the till. Then he limped back to
bed. It was as well he did not hear Sandy’s opinion
of his treasure.
“Let’s see it,” Sandy had demanded ; and then
as the object was displayed to his view he recoiled
in horror. “My God!” he exclaimed. “What a blot!
You don’t mean you seriously want me to paint
that ? I won’t do it.” It took several drinks to con-
vince him that he could and must. “That fence will
have to come out,” he scowled. “I’m damned if
I’ll do it with the fence there.”
“Do what you like,” Joe said impatiently. “But
get to work. I want it ready when he comes in
again.”
When Sandy got back to his untidy little studio
he sat with the treasure propped up on the table and
eyed it stonily. An oil painting, Joe had stipulated.
He had paid for the paints and canvas. It would
never do to offend Joe, who was one of the very few
sources of credit still left to Sandy. The faded ugliness
of the old homestead leered back at him. He sud-
denly snatched it up and flung off down to the Royal
Windsor.
“Joe,” he panted, “I’ll pay you Wednesday, so
help me. But I can’t do it. It’s atrocious.”
Joe glared at him. “You’re going to do it,” he
snarled, “if I break every bone in you. You’re going
to do a good job, too.” He seemed to have swollen
to twice his size. “Get out of here, you rat. You re
going to work for once in your life, if I kill you.”
“I’ll retouch the lousy thing”
“You’ll do a painting. Here,” Sandy was making
for the door as Joe overtook him, “don’t forget the
photo.”
“To hell with it! ” snapped Sandy, but he snatched
the hated object from Joe’s hand.
J T was a week before Sandy reappeared in the bar,
1 weary and depressed.
“It’s getting me down,” he said despairingly.
“It gets worse and worse.
I can’t sleep.”
“Where is it?”
“Oh! I’m getting on
with it. Progressing, you
know, progressing.” He
eyed Joe uneasily. “There
ought to be a tree in it to
hide some of the house. It’s
too bare. I think I could do
it if there were a tree.”
“Well,” Joe said toler-
antly, “shove in a tree.
Don’t make much difference, does it?”
“What sort of a tree?” Sandy asked listlessly.
Joe sucked his teeth. “How about a jacaranda?”
he asked, interested. “Big mauve things.”
“The photo was taken in winter,” Sandy objected.
“You can tell.”
“How can you tell?”
“I don’t know. I bet it was. And jacarandas
are bare in winter. Won’t do.”
“Well, make it summer.” Joe had a flash of
inspiration. “Make the tree in flower.”
“Have to alter all the lighting,” Sandy gloomed.
He went away thoughtfully.
Four days later he was back again. “I’ve taken
out the fence,” he said, “and I’ve put in the jacaranda.
Brightens it up. I whitewashed the fowlhouse.” Joe
hastened with congratulations, but Sandy eyed him
with a shifty guilt. “I put some sheep in front.
Looked too bare without.”
“0.K., 0.K.,” Joe said impatiently. “Anything
you like, as long as you finish it quick. George’ll
be round here any day now.”
“Joe,” Sandy whined presently, “I’d better tell
you.”
“What?”
“I couldn’t stand it. I built a room on the side
of the house.”
Joe looked doubtful. “Well, as long as it looks
all right,” he said reluctantly. The picture was cost-
ing him a lot, and it seemed to be taking a long time.
IS anxiety grew in the next fortnight when there
1 * was no sign of Sandy. Suppose that unreliable
and dissipated genius had torn up the photograph
in a fit of fury and been too afraid to come back
to the Royal Windsor? What would he say to
George? How would George look when he realised
that his one link with the old homestead was gone
for ever? That night after work Joe went round to
the mean house in whose top storey Sandy maintained
his tiny studio. He was told that Mr. Wilberforce was
not in. He knocked, he kicked at the door, he
shouted, he swore. He had just plodded down the
four flights of stairs and was standing across the
road watching gloomily in the hope that Sandy might
come home, when he saw a cautious head slowly
rising above the window sill, and a dark shadow leant
out to see if the attacker had departed.
“Sandy! ” he yelled.
The figure started. “Is that you, Joe?” Sandy
seemed surprised. “I thought it was the fellow to
cut off the gas. Come on up.”
Joe mounted the stairs once more, and this time
the door was flung open. Sandy switched on the
light proudly. “Well, there it is,” he sighed. “Finished
at last.” There were dark circles under his blood-
shot eyes ; his face was drawn and yellow.
All Joe’s rage went from him as he looked at
the canvas. “You done a nice job, Sandy,” he re-
marked humbly.
“I should say I had.” Joe would not have recog-
nised George’s old home. Gone was the obscuring
fence, and on the green slope in front of the house
sheep were grazing. The jacaranda was a thing of
misty loveliness; its branches cast a flickering of
sunlight and shadow over the new room that Sandy
had added to the side of the verandah. That extra
room seemed to have added something of dignity,
to have made the house symmetrical. Also it blotted
out the shed and the ragged outbuildings at the back.
“You done a nice job,” Joe repeated mildly
Then he stepped closer with his head on one side.
“There’s still something wrong with it,” he com-
mented.
Sandy made a noise between a moan and a
curse. “I won’t touch it again,” he objected hysteri-
cally. “It’s finished, I tell you.”
“Hang on a moment.” Joe walked from one
side to the other, thrusting out his neck like a tortoise.
“See that rise there? Well, it’s been a good season
by the grass. I been in the bush and I know. Well,
if it’s been a good season, there ought to be some
water in that dry watercourse.”
“What dry watercourse?” Sandy demanded
defiantly.
“In the photograph.”
“Have a look at it. There’s no dry watercourse.”
He held the photograph under Joe’s nose.
“That’s funny. I could have sworn there was
one here just below where the rise starts. Anyway,.
CONFESSION.
All I have got of wealth and wisdom, I
Have spent too hungrily on wine and men,
Fearing that some tomorrow I should die
Rich, wise and loveless, into dust again,
My laughter never loosed, my tears unshed,
Cold virtuous corpse stretched on a feather bed.
This spendthrift hunger, whetted on this fear,
Bullied its bread, ate like a famished beast
In watchful rage, and never did forbear
But snatched at every platter of the feast —
Love, hatred, friendship, charity,
Malice and kindness —all were one to me.
I lived full selfishly while time allowed,
Cast conscience out, invited in despair,
Lay down with joy, walked lonely with the crowd,
Read, wrote and ravished all I thought was fair,
Kept much, and lost the much I could not keep,
And found, like others, life’s best bliss was sleep.
So now, sprawled dead upon the plain of Time,
Churned by the worms of living memories,
I see I have been wise to feel no crime
In spending all on these eternities
Of men and wine, to buy on earth a heaven
Such as to better men was never given.

he went on stubbornly, “stands to reason there would
be a dry creek there. Drainage, see? You can tell.”
“There is not.”
“Well, there’s going to be. And it’s not going
to be dry. It’s a good season and there’s water in it.”
“I suppose next you’ll tell me there’s she-oaks
along the ridge,” Sandy said sardonically. He eyed
the picture excitedly. “Come to think of it, a she-
oak down in that corner would balance the composi-
tion ”
Joe beamed. “Don’t you forget I’m saying how it’s
to be painted,” he said gravely. “And something
else you’ve slipped on. Where’s the road?”
“What road?”
“Well, a place like that they always have a horse
and sulky, see? And the wheels ’ud cut a track
down that slope.” He indicated with his big clumsy
thumb. “About here.”
“Look out! It’s wet!” Sandy eyed the smear
despairingly. “Dammit, now I’ll have to put the
blasted wheel tracks in!”
“And another thing,” Joe went on, uncaring.
“It ’ud be a corduroy road, see? For the wet. And
then there’s the creek. They’d have a log bridge. A
big bump it’d make just here. A bump that’d show
up from where we’re standing. Get what I mean?”
“I think so.” Sandy sketched the bump in the
road where it crossed the creek. “Here, I’ll fix it
by daylight.”
“All right. And bring her round soon as she’s
finished.”
“I’m glad in a way you came,” Sandy said
thoughtfully. In spite of his haggard look he seemed
to stand straighter than Joe remembered. “The picture
of the year, eh?” He held out his hand. “We’ve
painted it together.”
To his surprise Joe took the hand and shook
it. “Good on you, Sandy boy,” he muttered. Then
doubt struck him. “Hope old George won’t mind
you altering the photo, a bit.”
picture was dry and framed and standing four
A days in the bar before George made his appear-
ance. By that time Joe was as nervous as a prima
donna. He had rehearsed the presentation of the
picture dozens of times, but when he saw George
standing there, grim, battered, paler than ever, with
his chin jutting out and his eyes half-shut, Joe’s nerve
failed him. “Haven’t seen you for a long time,
George,” he croaked.
“Had a bad spin,” George said evenly.
“I come for that photo. Chap fix it up?”
“Well, yes, he did in a way, but”
Joe stuck.
“What’s up? Got
a cold, haven’t you?”
“Just a touch,” Joe
admitted, recovering.
“Got something for
you.” He bent down
and brought up the
wrapped canvas. “I got
the photo., too,” he
hastened to assure his
suspicious friend. “It
ain’t hurt.” His palms
were moist, and he
breathed noisily and
anxiously as George
slowly undid the wrap-
pings. And then a ter-
rible thing happened.
George of the cold eye,
the imperturbable grim
Geojr g e, trembled,
gulped and collapsed
into a chair, crying
slowly and heavily as
though his heart would
break. It was a good
thing there was no one
in the bar. Joe hurried
round and patted him
on the shoulder, not
knowing what else to
do.
“I’ll make him do
it again,” he promised.
“Honest, George, I’ll
make him do it all over
again just the way it
was in the photo.”
George lifted his face from his arms, and it was
distorted so that Joe hardly knew it. He clutched
the barman’s sleeve. “How did you know?” he
asked in a whisper, “that there was a jacaranda-tree
there?”
“Well, we didn’t know. Just shoved it in.”
“Me mother planted it,” George said slowly,
“the year after that photo, was taken. The year
we built the new room on to the house. And Christ
A’mighty, how did you know the old man took that
fence away?” He was glaring at the canvas with
a look as though he would search out the secret,
“He made the front into all one big paddock, see?

e eyed Joe defiantly. I told you about them.
Maybe you did,” Joe agreed. “You like it all
right then?
“Like it!” George swore violently for a full
minute. “But there’s one thing you got in that nobody
could’ve known' unless they’d been there, and that’s
the bump in the flaming corduroy road just where
you cross the creek. It was a bump you couldn’t get
out.” He looked at Joe with a dazed puzzlement,
“Look, I’m feeling pretty crook. I think I’ll get
back to bed.” He stood up, holding the picture to
him. “Thanks, Joe. I can only say—thanks, son.
“You’re forgetting the photo.”
u “Oh yes,” George muttered, still in a daze, and
he took the photograph, too .
On the way back to the bos P lta l be bad to sit
down and rest every few yards, and every time he
did so he unwrapped the picture and gazed at it
a g a j n a westruck. “Even the sheep,” he murmured,
“Everything there.”
Back in bed again, he rested and thought. He
was std j thinking next day when the chaplain came
round the ward as usual. To the chaplain’s aston-
ishment he realised that George Orr was beckoning
to him.
“Remember me?” the patient asked grimly,
struggling up in bed.
“Why, yes, yes, certainly,” the chaplain said with
his most professional cheerfulness. “Spine, wasn’t
it?” He had no notion of George’s name, only that
his was the cold, hard eye that had followed him
sardonically down the ward.
“Remember talking to me once about miracles?”
The chaplain stirred uneasily. “Yes, yes,” he
said hurriedly. “A very debatable point. We can
only have faith.”
“Do you believe in miracles?” Again the chap-
lain looked embarrassed. He had no time to answer
before George said slowly, “I thought I’d tell you.
So you could say ‘Yes’ if anyone asked you. I seen
one.” The chaplain was startled. He privately
decided to have a word with the nurse. “I seen one,”
George said, contentedly settling back. “And I got
faith, I seen a flamin’ miracle for meself.”
In the bar of the Royal Windsor Joe was run-
ning a forgiving pencil through the alarming total of
Sandy’s drinks.
THE CHRISSMUS GOEST
By HAMER, JUNIOR.
IN spiet of himself, Raymond Rightwun’s hare stood
on end. He sore the pail, loominus figger move
noyslessly along the corrydoor, and helled his
breth.
The wind howelled arownd the house as if
dettermind to kreate the atmosfear for a Goest
Storey. In the terrubell silens a pin could be herd to
fall.
It was the Eve of Chrissmus, and Raymond had
come to the Motored Grange filled with a desprit
resolve. This oled house had bellonged to his grand-
father until the oled man had been fowlly murdered.
At the inkwest the jury brought in a verdickt of
“Willful murder by some Person or Persons unnown,
probly Sir Marmaduke Twicely.” But Sir Marma-
duke, the old man’s unnatcheral neffew and Ray-
mond’s wicked Unkle, had dissappeered. He was also
suspected of having desstroyed the missing Will, wich
remained a mistry.
“Stop pullin' my leg.”
The oled man’s money could not be fowned, and
missforchune had fallen on Raymond’s fammily. Un-
abel to sekure Employmint, his pore father had dun
no work for 4 years. Now, nothing was left but
Starvashon, ecksepting the oled house. Since the oled
man’s death it was serposed to be hawnted. They
could not live in the bi S P lace themselves, and nobody
would taik the Motored Grange with its Sinster Rep-
putashun.
If they could let the house they wood be saved.
The agent had said that weak that he had a lady who
liked the house, but she wood not taik it wile it was
ockewpied by a Goest. The people who lived next
door toled terrufying stories of weired noyses and
strange htes ; and people shunned the spot.
The surcumstanses of Raymonds fammily had
becum desprit. Raymond, working as an offis boy,
had dun his best, but his money did not pay the rent
of their garrit in Woolloomoolloo. And now it was
Chrissmus. The fammily was starving. Raymond’s
mother lay in bed dyeing, unnabel to bye the medsins
that mite save her life. And now the worssed had
hapened.
Unnabel to bare the thort of his chilledren’s
misry, Raymond’s Father had deeklared that he wood
end it orl. Raymond had rushed into the streat,
dettermind that something mussed be dun. If he cood
show that there was no Goest, they mite be abel to let
the Motored Grange, and get the first weak’s rent in
addvans for Chrissmus.
With this desprit eyedear, the brave Raymond
had interred the dark house. He was ashtonished at
the seen of destruckshun. The torn-up floring-bords
and shattered walls were evydens of Goestly Orgies.
And now the fizzerlogical moement had arrived. With
beeting hart, Raymond allmosed wished he had not
come; but the thort of his father’s thrett and his
mother dyeing without medsins and his starving
brothers and sisters urjed him on. He dashed after
the gray figger. It seamed to turn on him,
and sudenly he new no more.
T EFFED for ded, Raymond came to his
*—’ census with an aking head on wich he
felt a big bump. A less

Threw the dark-
ness he sore an eerey

stellthilly towards it
fowned it came from a
room in wich an orful
figger with a blooish
lite about it seamed
nealing by the wall, as
if engaged in some un-
wholly right.
A suden tho r t
struck Raymond.
The Goest looked
rowned with an un-
earthly skreem as he
sore beeside him a
figger no less Goestly
than himself.
“I konfess! ” he
shreeked. -“It was I

“I arressed you, Sir

said the stern pollisman
who, hearing the
skreem, had entered un-
annownsed. So sayying,
he tore the sheet from
the hed of his kaptive, reveeling the form of Ray-
mond’s wicked unkle.
Raymond, whose roose had unmasked the villin,
himself through aside the sheet he had put on, and
seezed the kaskett of treesoor which Sir Mar-
maduke had been eggstrackting from the whole in
the Wall.
“Now the mistry is solved. This is the Money

OAVMOND burssed into the bossom of his fammily

and an eenormus Chrissmus Pudding in the other.
Only jessed in time. His father was in the acked of
droring the razer across his throate when his son’s

A Feeling Sketch
SHIFT TO THE CITY
By CAVIN S.CASEY
WHEN I came up the shaft Nugget Kelly was
lounging around in his working clothes, and
he came over. I wondered what he wanted,
and when he told me I got a shock.
“Y’ better tell your brother to look out,” he said.
“The dees is on to him.” Then he set off for the
change-room, a few paces ahead of me, without saying
another word.
I got a shock all right. When Nugget said any-
thing like that it was the dinkum oil. How he knew
was nobody’s business, but everyone knew he knew.
You couldn’t feel comfortable after Nugget had said
a thing like that. I got a shock in another way, too.
You see, I’d never been told before that my brother
Reg went in for the yellow stuff. I must have known,
I suppose, because a man couldn’t live the way he was
doing on his pay, but I’d never been told and I’d
never asked. I’d left the racket alone myself, more
from caution than honesty perhaps, and I’d liked to
kid myself Reg was on the level, too.
That night I went over to Reg’s place and gave
him the news. He didn’t say anything at first, just
sat there on the verandah smoking and looking out
at the lights of the town, and I did my block a bit.
“Well, what are you going to do?” I asked.
“You’d better do something.”
“I’ll have to get out,” he said.
“I know that,” I snapped, pretty hot under the
collar. “But where to, that’s what I want to know.”
It wasn’t so good. Behind us, in the house there,
were Reg’s wife and his two nippers, and a
few blocks away was my place, with Sadie and the
kid in it. There was going to be trouble for some-
one, whatever way it worked out, and Sadie and I
were going to get a backwash most likely, even if Reg
pulled out and left the goldfields for good. I felt like
kicking him to death for making such a mess of things.
But when he spoke again I savvied that he’d have
kicked himself to death in the past five minutes if it
had been a possibility.
“I’ll have to go to the city, I s’pose,” said Reg.
“I can get a little store or something. There ain’t
much else a miner’s good for.”
Reg was a big, active bloke, and young, too. He
was fond of the life he lived, with hard graft and big
money, and plenty of spending and fun, and men’s
company whenever he felt like it, though he didn’t
neglect Jean and the nippers. I looked at him, and
remembered all I knew of him, which was pretty con-
siderable, and then I forgot how wild I was because I
could see how much worse off he’d be than me. He’d
made a fool of himself, but he’d pay all right. I could
just picture him in a suburban store, working fourteen
hours a day, but never hard. I could see him cursing
when the bell over the door rang for him, and I could
see him doling out the penny lolly-sticks, and getting
careless about his morning shave, and putting on flesh
where the muscle was now, and getting peevish and
hopeless and changing altogether.
“Hell!” 1 said, startled. “We can think up a
better dodge than that.”
Then we were brothers again, and I didn’t give a
damn. There were things he’d done for me when we
were kids, and later when we were larrikins around
the town. The business stopped being a problem of
his that might have a backwash for me, and became
our problem. He sensed it, and brightened up a bit,
though he stayed pretty hopeless.
But there was a bright spot. I got another first-
class shock when I found out how much money Reg
had. He’d been into the yellow stuff up to the ears
all right, and when he told me I started getting ideas.
“Gosh! ” I said. “That’s nearly enough for us
to get back into my old business.”
“I won’t drag you into it,” said Reg. “You’ve
got a good job, and if you’re wise you’ll stick to it.”
But he said it in a tone that made it pretty plain
how much better he felt at the faintest chance of the
pair of us staying together. I didn’t need much
urging. The ideas that were buzzing through my brain
were the ones I’d had when Sadie and I were first
married, when we were living at the coast and I was
out on the road for Charles and Gribble, the toy
people. There was a depression, and a time when
Reg had carried the pair of us, and a lot of other
things between those days and the present, but the
idea of starting a toy factory came back as hot and
strong as when I’d first been infected with it, and
the more I talked the keener we both got.
IT was wonderful how quickly our plans developed.
1 We couldn’t do it in the style I’d imagined myself
launching out in when 1 was a kid, but we could do it
in a style that was good enough for me now I was a
man and had learned a thing or two. Reg didn’t go
back down the shaft again, and I snatched my time
straight away. The women, Jean and my Sadie, liked
the scheme, too, when they’d got over the initial
fright that women always suffer when their husbands
are all set to throw up security for fine, big, dan-
gerous plans. They didn’t know about Reg’s trouble,
of course, though they must have had a shrewd idea
where the money came from.
When I left the fields, I was optimistic and glad.
Reg and I went down ahead to find a place and all
that, and I was sure as aces.
The certainty wore off after we reached the city
and I began to realise the responsibility for the lot
“I bet you tell that to all the girls.”
of us and how it all rested on me. I was rusty, too,
after five years down below. I was just a miner try-
ing to do business, and I’d changed in lots of ways.
All that time among a mob that won’t stand a word of
cheek from any man had somehow made negotiating
look pretty much like crawling, and when some tin-
pot department manager felt an urge to show his
authority on me I didn’t feel like a salesman should.
I felt more like giving him a handful of knuckles to
go on with, and I used to go red and awkward, and
once or twice I spoke out of my turn and felt pretty
bad about it afterwards when I thought how much
the whole gang of us depended on me. I thought I’d
have done better to let Reg slip into some little busi-
ness that would at least keep him going for a few years
while it swallowed his capital.
But, of course, the first week was too busy for
worry. We had to find a place for a start, and we
wanted one big enough for the whole crew of us,
with a pretty big shed attached if possible for a fac-
tory. There were plenty of joints that answered the
description, and anyone could have them for about
a tenner a week, but we nearly walked ourselves to
death before we found one we could afford. When
we did it was pretty horrible.
The wallpaper was peeling, and there were prob-
ably insects. It was cheap and big enough for all
of us, and there was a shed at the back that could
be the “factory,” though it made me sick to look at it.
But I was too busy to worry much. Our furniture
started to arrive, and Reg got to work on the place
and on installing a wood-lathe and one thing and
another in the shed, while I ripped around the town
getting back into the run of the toy business, and buy-
ing up our bits of plant and feeling optimistic enough
most of the time, but pretty gloomy sometimes.
It was remarkable how the time and the money
vanished while we got things ready, but it was too
late to start bellyaching about things then. Reg was
good. He had plenty of trust in me, and he had a
sense of humor. He used to laugh at our makeshift
plant and tell me to give him a decent funeral when
the line of shafting pulled the wall out of the shed
and the lot came down on him.
nr HE day came when we had to go to the railway
1 station to meet the women. It hadn’t been much
fun travelling with the kids, and all the carriages had
been crowded. Sadie looked properly washed out,
and our young sinner looked a grubby little bundle
after the journey. He wasn’t worried about a bit of
dirt though. He grinned at me (which was pretty
much more than Sadie could manage), and he bucked
about in her weary arms and yelled gibberish until I
took him and one of the bags, and Reg handled the
rest of the luggage. We went out, and it was rain-
ing in the city, dropping down a grey drizzle quite
unlike the brief, hearty downpours that make the
gutters run a banker on the goldfields.
We felt a strange crew, looking at the city as
something different from a holiday town of brilliant
shows and blazing beaches, for the first time for
years. We were young, and I suppose we all reckoned
we knew our way about pretty well, but just then I
reckon we felt pretty much like steerage immigrants
feel when they get herded ashore in a strange land.
We could speak the language, of course, but we were
different from the people all around. Our roots weren’t
in this city. The people were smart, busy and business-
like, while our women were travel-stained and tired,
and Reg and I felt all hands and feet.
We went over to a little restaurant and found a
dark, quiet corner. I thought that a drink of tea and
something to eat would do them good before they had
to face the house. The women operated on their
faces, and drank out of the steaming cups and started
to feel more cheerful. They told us about their
journey, while Reg’s kids sat quiet and awed, and
my nipper, who was younger, sucked a biscuit and
looked shrewd and grabbed at everything in sight,
and tried to crawl away every time he got loose. I
was glad to see Sadie again. I needed some comfort
and consolation, and I began to get excited and happy.
Then Reg splashed up on a taxi, and we bowled away
from the buildings and smartness of the city toward
our unpleasant suburb.
When we were gliding down our street and the
taxi we were in was the only clean, respectable-looking
thing in sight I panicked. There were dingy pickle-
factories and untidy case-factories, and heat and noise
and filth in battered moulders and blacksmiths’ sheds,
and piles of rusty iron in their yards. There were
dirty children and staggering fences, and small houses
crowded against each other in tiny yards. No one
ever accuses the goldfields of being beautiful, but up
there the streets are clean and wide, and sunshine
washes the town daily, summer and winter, when
there’s no rain to do the job. The rusty metal in the
foundry yard and on the leases isn’t an offence against
decency, as piles of junk in sodden yards that line
narrow, hilly streets seem to be. The picket and iron
fences there sway a bit sometimes, but they always
enclose big, bare yards, and there’s room to breathe.
I felt guilty and ashamed seeing our new home clearly
for the first time, and it became urgently necessary
that I should reassure Sadie in some way. I gripped
her arm, and pressed her shoulder against my body.
“It’s only temporary, Sade,” I whispered. “It’s not for
long.”
“It’s all right, Jack,” she said. She did her best,
and I was warmly grateful, but her lip was drooping.
Reg started wisecracking about the place and the
“factory,” but nobody laughed. I hung on to Sadie,
and groped for something to say and couldn’t find it.
We went into the house, and even if it wasn’t so
good it had our familiar furniture in it, and its walls
shut out the ugliness of the street. But I could see
now that Reg and I were poor hands with the
broom and scrubbing-brush, and that there would be
plenty of work for the women. They cracked hardy
and tried to joke about it, but they looked strained
and discouraged. I felt sick with shame and with fear
of the future, and I suddenly saw how little all my
great schemes were worth. I saw how unfair I’d been
dragging them down with me, and at that moment I
was sure I was a fool and that we would do nothing
but struggle and fail.
/'“'NF course, that’s not how it worked out in the long
run. We’ve been able to live well in good separate
houses of our own for a long time now, and the old
place has been pulled down and the whole of its block
is filled with our new factory building. We’ve got a
solid trade and we’re doing well, and Sadie and I
sometimes remember and laugh over how we shifted
to the city. Reg and I like to remember it, too, now
that he’s a prosperous citizen with half a good manu-
facturing business instead of just an underground man
with the dees on his trail. But that was how I felt
at the time, and it’s moments like that that knock the
starch out of a man, and make him frightened of risks,
and bring him to the stage where he worships security
like a woman. I know I wouldn’t take a risk to
become a millionaire now, and I couldn’t face any-
thing like our shift to the city again.


A Tale of Comradeship
KADITCHA
By
HENRIETTA
DRAKE-BROCKMAN
l-T'NALLU was a night station.
\A / Only staff men on duty
VV bothered about the ex-
presses, though there was
always a bit of a stir when the Tea-
and-Sugar groaned in, bringing sup-
plies. When some of the crowd on
the westbound Trans, discovered that
Mollie Ward was actually going to
disappear into the night, get off the
express and stop out there at Wallu,
they jeered out loud: “You!” they
screamed. “Don’t think you can pull
our legs like that!”
“It’s my home,” said Mollie,
who’d lived as a kid on the Nullar-
bor Plain and saw nothing laughable
about it. “My dad’s on the staff” —
Mollie Ward, she’d got a career ahead ; every
newspaper with which the carriage was strewn car-
ried paragraphs about her singing. In the wash-hand
basin the last of the concert bouquets was being
coddled to show her mother. “Good God,” everybody
said. “You can’t tell us your home is out there. Why,
these trains are the only bit of life they ever see.”
Mollie looked out of the window. Before, it
hadn’t ever seemed empty. She knew there were little
barking lizards and mountain-devils and eagle-hawks
and white owls in the blowholes —and brilliant flowers
in the dongas after it had rained. Things passengers
knew nothing about. They had never listened to the
voice of the sea where it travelled up through under-
ground caverns, a hundred miles into the heart of the
plain. Yet now suddenly she had to impress herself
with all that: it seemed as if she was seeing old
Nullarbor for the first time, a great empty sea of earth
covered with ghostly spume of blue bush. A desert —
as most people called it. Only it wasn’t. Dingo James,
with his trapping-trail swinging five hundred miles in
a great half-circle down to the Bight, would be the one
to put them right about that.
In the middle of the night she stepped out into
what seemed to be a black void. Then suddenly her
father was there, snatching a kiss between duties,
between filling the water-tanks, and her mother was
there, and —what gave her a shock —Dingo James.
Yet arriving was all very quiet and ordinary ; flat
as the plain, after the fuss leaving Sydney. “I bet
you’re glad to have a little freedom,” said her mother.
Dingo’s hand felt hard as one of his steel traps, except
it gave her a sense of life and energy. “I just hap-
pened to be in,” he explained. “Glad to see you, all
the same.”
Mr. Mackintosh passed along the train, spanner
in hand. He breathed deep enough to say “ ’Lo,
Mollie,” but he was too full of business to look at
her. She saw her mother grin: always the same,
Mackintosh, full of importance, and mad because,
have it how you like, her dad was station-master and
got the last say, though Mac could boss it as much
as he liked in the engine sheds.
How still and dark it was. The desert swallow-
ing the little noises of the express. She’d forgotten
how still and enormous Nullarbor was at night.
“Come on over to the house,” said her mother.
Dingo picked up her bags. Then a figure flung
past in a flash, skating on the ballasting, half-tripping,
catching itself up so you could hear the sob of a long
breath.
“Stop him, Dingo,” yelled Mackintosh from down
the train. Dingo didn’t bother. “Can’t get far,” he
drawled. “What’s your hurry?”
Mackintosh came up breathing hard. “Hobo,”
he spluttered. “Riding under the-platform steps. Two
of ’em. Can’t see how Ward missed ’em.”
Dingo said: “Poor devils. Wouldn’t like to ride
down there all the way from ’Gusta.”
“Can’t you chase him?” demanded Mackintosh.
“I’m shifting Miss Ward’s luggage,” said Dingo.
“You’ll get him. No hurry.”
Mrs. Ward made tea as soon as they got home.
They were in the kitchen, sitting over their second
cups, before Ward came in. Dingo greeted him:
“What ye thinking of, mon? Where’s your eyes,
mon, not tae see yon meeserable hoboes?”
Mollie watched her dad rub his hands, grinning.
“Can you beat Mac for an interfering busybody?
There was I all for letting ’em get on into Kal. and
maybe land a job. Now they got ter go back to
’Gusta at the Government’s expense and spend a week
in the cooler. I reckon two chaps game enough to
ride like that for the best part of a thousand miles is
worth giving a go.”
“Too right. But what you doing now?”
“One chap’s still lost,” said Ward. “Mac’s got
the other in tow.”
Even Dingo jumped when a voice spoke suddenly
out of the front bedroom: “Couldja give me a drink
of tea?”
The lost hobo ventured into the light. He pushed
a hand over dirt-streaked hair and said: “I reckon I
couldn’t get away in the desert. But I could do a
drink of tea.” He wasn’t any older than Mollie ; his
face was red with dust, so his eyes, red-rimmed and
deep-sunk, looked bright as blue china beads. His
shirt was dust-red, his black denim pants red-streaked
—scarlet blood streaked below the knee of the left
leg, badly torn.
“Why,” said Mrs. Ward, finding her tongue, “your
poor leg”
Kaditcha Shoes, constructed of emu
feathers matted with blood and with a band
woven of hair to keep them on the feet, were
used by the aborigines to disguise their foot-
marks when on expeditions of vengeance.
Legend had it that they rendered the wearer
invisible.
That sent him off. He fell over in a dead faint at
their feet.
“Good Lord,”*said Ward. “What a gash! It’s
where the undercarriage bit into him.”
Mackintosh chose that moment to hammer qn
the door. “So you got him,” he said. “Here’s the
other.”
“Look where you step,” snapped Dingo. “This
chap’s out to it. Give us a chance.”
Dingo had the youngster round in no time, leg
washed and fixed up, hot tea and tucker fetching
color back to his white face. His cobber, older,
darker, tougher, sat by on a chair and said nothing.
Nobody said much, except Mackintosh. “Well, Ward,
who’s going ter keep ’em till No. 2 comes in to-
morrow?”
“Oh, they can stop in one of the tent-houses,”
said Ward. “We’ll tucker ’em.” He turned to the
men. “You won’t get far in the desert,” he said.
The dark chap spoke up. “We won’t try. Don’t
know what made us run when you stopped us, really.
Sort of impulse.” He spoke well. He’d got a sort of
swagger, too, under the dirt and stubble and ragged
clothes.
After Mackintosh had gone, the atmosphere
changed. Ward said: “Maybe I’d have kept you a
day or two, and been looking over east if you’d tried
“The chief wants devilled missionary with mushrooms —where does the
old goat think I’m going to get mushrooms ?”
to catch the next westbound —if it’s Kal. you want
to reach.”
“Reckon it’s work we want. Reckon there ought
to be work on the fields,” said the dark chap.
“I dunno about that —all I know is I can’t keep
you now. Mackintosh’ll be all there to see you go
back in the brake-van tomorrow.”
The youngster didn’t exactly whimper, but he ran
a hand down his leg, over the bandages. Second-rate
stuff, he looked, now he was washed. Dingo didn’t
like the look of him, yet he’d had spunk to ride like
he did. If he got sent back to gaol now it wouldn’t
do him any good.
The older chap said sourly:
“We might as well be blooming
abos.”
Dingo looked from Ward to the
young chap and back again, then
started to talk. He kept his eyes on
Ward. “I don’t think I want to go
out along the trail for a bit. Sup-
pose I sent another coupla chaps
out, with Yarda? Suppose they went
out and did a spot of trapping?
They could keep the change and
fetch up further down the line in,
say, a couple of months’ time.
Trappers could pay their way into
Kal., no questions asked. Suppos-
ing these hoboes just did a bunk
into the desert, what’s Mac to
know?”
T" HE No. 2 express steamed east from Wallu
* next night without any extra passengers. Mack-
intosh smelt a rat all right, and had gone so far as to
pay a visit to Dingo’s camp. But Yarda spotted him
coming, and, short of being offensive, Mackintosh
couldn’t poke under the pile of pelts heaped high in
the back of the old rattle-trap car Dingo took on the
trail. All Dingo said was that he was sending Yarda
out on his own next morning.
“Seems to me you think a lot of him,” said Mack-
intosh. “I’d no be trusting any half-caste with me
plant like that.”
“Yarda’s one of the best. I’d trust him better
than plenty of white men I know. I’m thinking of
putting him on percentage ’stead of wages. He’s got
a family to think of now, and he’s worth a rise, and
worth being made independent, too.”
“So you’re starting by stopping in yourself, and
sending him out —on his own?”
“Yeah,” said Dingo, rolling a smoke and meeting
Mackintosh’s eye, level as the plain. “Going
tomorrow.”
And Dingo’s plant was gone when Mackintosh
looked out as the sun came up over the rim of the
plain next day. He went back to bed sore because
he’d not got up to spy at crack of dawn.
boarded himself out at Ward’s, took a
holiday, and began wondering if he could do him-
self over to suit Mollie’s taste —forget the lonely silent
dawns, the scent of wood smoke, the nights wide as
space, dark and silent as death ; forget the eye-
cracking sun, the taste of black scalding tea ; forget
Yarda and the songs he made when they camped
alone in the desert; go down into the cities and become
one of the crowd. Dingo didn’t think he could. Except
when Mollie looked at him the doubtful way she had ;
as if she might be wondering if there were a few things
she also could forget.
It hadn’t got any further than that —though Mrs.
Ward reckoned it should have—before it was time for
Mollie to go back to the city. The days had van-
ished quick as the sun sank over the rim of the desert
horizon, days spent in
walking on the plain
with Dingo, listening
to his yarns, in play-
ing tennis with Dingo
down at the courts, in
dancing with him
social nights at the
hall, till her father
complained they ought
to raise his board and
charge entertainment
tax. Dingo just
grinned and kept on
watching Mollie as if
she were a sunrise out
on the plain, except
when she talked about
studios and recitals
and whatnots in the
city. He’d take his
pipe out of his mouth
then, Mrs. Ward
noticed, and start
cleaning it, even in the
middle of a smoke.
Then Yarda came
in unexpectedly. He
looked dog-poor, as
if he’d not had
enough tucker. He’d
left the two white
white fellers out about
the ten-mile, he told
Dingo. They’d had a
good run, cleaned up
round fifty pelts—he’d got ’em in the car with him—
and the fellers reckoned if Dingo would take the pelts
over, cash down, Yarda could take the money back
to them, then drop them off at a siding further west,
so’s they could pick up a train and get along into Kal.
Yarda was to thank his boss for all he’d done to
give them a break . . .
Dingo’s eyes never left Yarda’s face. “What’s
up?” he demanded at the end.
Yarda shifted his shoulders, and said nothing
was up, he wanted to get over to his humpy and see
his woman and the kids.

THE HAYMARKET.
Running parallel with Lower Regent Street from Coventry Street to Pall Mall is the Haymarket, a short thoroughfare which has witnessed
many changes in its time. Where the luxurious Carlton Hotel, illustrated, now stands at the north-western corner of the Haymarket and
Pall Mall, for many years stood Her Majesty s Theatre, a London landmark in its day, and the sole temple of Italian Opera in the
Metropolis. The Haymarket is now given over largely to theatres and cinemas, though there still remain fashionable shops, some of which
are in the new large and not altogether unimposing “utility structure” known as Haymarket House. To most people in 1940, the
Haymarket possessed, for obvious reasons, what shall be called “a unique interest,” from an incident which occurred one hundred and
thirty-seven years before, or in 1803. Proceeding down the Haymarket from Coventry Street, the first turning on the left marks Panton
Street, a short thoroughfare running through to Whitcomb Street. It was then, on the afternoon of June 9 in the latter year, a most
singular phenomenon happened which provided Londoners of that day with an experience somewhat similar in certain phases to what
their successors were to be met with before the following century had reached its “50-mark.” Perhaps it will be better to take the
record of the learned David Hughson, LL.D., in his great work “The Circuit of London” (1820), Vol. I, p. 654:
“The inhabitants were alarmed by a violent and tremendous storm of rain and hail which extended only to Oxendon Street,
Whitcomb Street, and Coventry Street and the Haymarket, a space not exceeding 200 acres. For about seven minutes the torrent
from the heavens was so great that it could only be compared to a cataract rushing over the brow of a precipice. In the
midst of the hurricane an electric cloud descended in Panton Street, which struck the centre of the coachway, and sunk it to
a great depth, forming a complete pit, in which not a vestige of the materials which had before occupied the space could be
found. The sulphurous odour from the cloud was so powerful that for several seconds persons near the spot were almost suffocated.”

WALLABY-EYE WAR VIEW.
Listening-in to the war news and to dissertations on
their own country’s war effort —as they can hardly
help doing, wherever they are —the wallabies and other
native fauna have experienced mixed feelings.
Without undue conceit, they find fair grounds for
feelings of patriotic pride. The Diggers are over in
Egypt again, and the smallest lizard sheltering under
a pebble on the Nullarbor has no doubt about the
account they will give of themselves. By latest infor-
mation, they were also still in large numbers in Eng-
land, part of the gathering there of troops from all
parts of the Empire, and from France, Belgium, Hol-
land, Poland, Norway and other lands —the most ex-
traordinary assemblage of defenders the amazing little
island has ever known.
The Diggers and their brothers of the R.A.N. and
the R.A.F. have been sighted in other far-flung parts
of the world: in age-old Palestine, hobnobbing again
with the Arabs, and with Jews who can’t be distin-
guished from the Arabs as they toil in their fields ; a
handful, it seems, in Greece; some —if what Mr.
Casey has been telling America is correct —in Singa-
pore ; others in Canada and Rhodesia ; others again
in the Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.
Wherever sighted, it can be given out as the official
wallaby-eye view that they will fight like hell let loose.
Those bluejackets and airmen who have been in
action have already done so ; and .1914-18 Diggers
who are officers with the new crop in Egypt and
Palestine expect that they will not only equal but
excel tradition.
Hitherto, our fighting men have been in action
only in such distant parts. What they have done
there should serve as a double warning on how they
would defend their own seagirt portions of the earth.
In this respect a slight cloud of doubt shadows the
otherwise pleasant scene. Australia, with some
3,000,000 square miles, has only 7,000,000 people, in-
cluding babes in arms and octogenarians, to defend it
—55,000 square miles less than the U.S.A. and
115,000,000 fewer people. Maoriland spreads over
100,000 square miles, with 1,700,000 people. It
has been pointed out with friendly pity by a United
States statistician that these sparsely peopled Pacific
lands are “within a week’s sail of 500,000,000 land-
hungry Asiatics, and within ten days’ sail of about
1,000,000,000 ditto.”
Happily, defence is not wholly a matter of statis-
tics. There is the imponderable element of fighting
quality, and, without overstating the value of possess-
ing that in proved measure, or being so complacent as
to think its possession alone is enough, there is some
comfort in knowing that all along this war has been
underlining the importance of that quality. In the
light of subsequent happenings, there can be no doubt
that the Poles possessed it abundantly: in due time
history will give them credit for the way they fought
against far greater and better-equipped numbers, and
with no advantages of natural or prepared defences.
The Finns, microscopic in numbers against the Red
Russian hordes, won the admiration of the world
wholly by virtue of their fighting quality. By that
quality more than anything else, the R.A.F. won the
battle of the air over Britain against the German
masses of ’planes. The Greeks, with the odds seem-
ingly so heavily against them that even yet their per-
formance is somehow incredible, by sheer fighting
quality drove the Italians pell-mell through Albania.
As well as all that, it has to be admitted that it
was fighting quality which gave the Germans their
succession of victories. Because, as every Old Digger
can testify, the Germans have that quality strongly—at
all events, while they are winning—they were able to
beat down the stout resistance of the Poles, overwhelm
the brave and naturally well-defended Dutch, and, rid-
ing the crest of their apparently overwhelming power,
beat the huge French army into capitulation in a
matter of days, Maginot Line and all.
The well-evident truth about fighting quality is
plainly that some nations have it and some haven’t;
and what this war has most importantly proved to the
comfort of small nations like Australia and Maori-
land is that possession of that quality can make up in
considerable measure for lack of numbers. That,
however, is as much as should be said about it—a very
handy attribute to have about.
Having, as a matter of course, no Fascist-minded
fifth columnists among them, the wallabies and the
rest have been thrilled, if not electrified, by the various
broadcast, platform and press accounts of what is
being done to raise the necessary superstructure of
armaments and training on that natural fighting
quality. Maoriland, sensibly taking the view that total
war calls for total etfort, without evasion or subter-
fuge, introduced conscription (like Britain), and in
other measures has been a step ahead of Australia
throughout. But in that respect M.L. has had the
advantage of precedents dating from the last war,
whereas Australia has had some very hampering pre-
cedents. In view of some of these, the most dis-
gruntled bunyip in the country would have to admit
that Australia has done pretty well.
There is no need to point to what happened here
10 years ago, when a Labor Government, enjoying its
only two years of office in 20-odd years, wrecked the
whole defence establishment of the country. That
must be painful enough history to everybody, without
rubbing it in ; though, perhaps, it would be as well
to resolve that nothing like it must ever happen again.
It is more to the point, in getting a comparative back-
ground against which to view Australia’s war effort,
to recall that it was in the year war broke out —indeed,
it was after that lamentable event —that Australian
Labor’s leader declared that his party would “strenu-
ously challenge the reintroduction of compulsory mili-
tary training” ; not conscription, nor any suggestion
of it, but training, which is to say training for home
defence!
Even in this present year, which has seen the
destruction of one little country after another, with
Greece a striking exception, loud mouthpieces of the
party which nearly secured control of Australia’s war
effort were heard denouncing national service. Mr.
Lang, for example: “I object to conscription,
whether for home service or for service abroad”
(7/2/’4O). It is against this sort of thing and much
else that Australia’s war effort is rightly to be viewed.
It is a matter of comparison with the past
position, and what has been done in the time avail-
able. Nothing but good could come of the honest
spurrings Mr. Beasley has from time to time adminis-
tered to the Government; but the fact stands that, in
the time available, a big job has been done towards
realising the aim advanced by Mr. Menzies: “We must
make ourselves and our armed forces so strong that
the enemy may not be disposed to attack us at all.”
From the deplorable position Australia was in
when this war started, it is something to have two
divisions and more overseas ; a large part of the pros-
pective 250,000 troops for home defence already
trained ; getting well on for the planned 80,000 em-
ployed directly on munitions and the further 70,000
producing materials for munition-making. With the
old background always in mind —a background giving
the wallabies and related fauna fair reason for be-
lieving they were due to pass under new management
at any moment —it is something to be turning out
’planes, destroyers, guns and shells, machine-guns and
rifles, air bombs, naval mines and depth charges. To
pay for all this, it is something to be stumping up
taxes at rates unprecedented in Australia’s history—
taxes so heavy that the instalment plan had to be in-
troduced to make them bearable, if not to make it
possible to collect them at all in the time.
Certainly the good in all this is cause for satisfac-
tion in the wallaby-eye view—these loyal denizens and
their relations being historically aware of what un-
preparedness and other failings cost the previous man-
agement. It can be semi-officially hinted, however,
that the wallabies, etc., hold rather peculiar views on
another aspect of the war-time scene.
There is just a bit too much talk, they think, just
a bit too much self-satisfaction, regarding the sup-
posed “sacrifices” everybody is making. They have
heard references to these supposed “sacrifices” by
every speaker in the land who has touched on the war,
from Mr. Menzies down, without any exception. In-
dividual Australians of both sexes and all callings
have been heard, and are to be heard daily, in the same
strain. Being naturally mild-mannered creatures, the
wallabies, etc., regret seeming to criticise, but point out
that they themselves have long had actual experience
of war, denied to the managing inhabitants, apart
from the aforementioned Digger sect. In their experi-
ence there is only one real sacrifice in war, and that
is bodily sacrifice —to be killed, or to be maimed.
That is all. For the rest, what are these sup-
posed “sacrifices” but a very large name for inconveni-
ences? It can be pressed further, and suggested that
the alleged “sacrifices,” made under the compulsion
of war, are nothing more than a really alert people
might have made, and should have made, out of
commonsense and appreciation of their heritage, in
time of peace. It might be pressed still further, to sug-
gest that —so long as the war remains remote, and Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders at home are not called upon
to go through it as the people of Britain are going
through it —the only ones from these parts who will
make real sacrifices will be the men of the R.A.N.,
the R.A.A.F. and the A.1.F., close relations included.
It is a matter of living unharmed or being killed or
maimed. The rest are cheapjack “sacrifices” at the
most, a sop to conscience. It will be good if a spur
to conscience keeps with them, to ensure that those
who will make sacrifices have the best done for them
that can be done, now and afterwards.
At all events, that is the main view advanced by
the wallabies and other fauna of these parts in their
latest pronouncement on the largely admirable war
effort. Their interest in the matter, of course, is that
self-interest which —even among people suffering loud
pangs of moral indignation—now controls sentiment
everywhere. The present management having tried
them and found them not so good to eat, they prefer
it to an unknown management that might regard them
as delicacies. After all, there are people who eat
frogs, and others whose taste runs to birds’-nests and
dried fish.
The Evacuation of Sydney.
Nobody could place the beginning exactly, but the
movement became apparent towards the end of 1941.
By that time all the Water Board’s dams but one were
bone-dry, and the one that wasn’t was almost. There
had been prayers for rain, but they couldn’t penetrate
the noise being sent up from Europe, or perhaps the
Chief Rainmaker was busy at the time ; anyhow there
was no rain.
The Snowy River scheme had been started by
1943, but the confounded river sprung a leak or the
snows didn’t fall and the work was so slow that a
royal commission appointed to investigate it was
never heard of again. They were bringing water in
from Hume and Burrinjuck by train, but it was far
from enough ; besides, a lot of people objected to the
nice, fresh taste of it. A board was created to control
its distribution, of course, and that settled that. Then
the Government and the City Council put condensers
along the sea front. Still there wasn’t enough.
The first notable movement was from the
Western Suburbs. Several manufacturing companies
pulled down their factories and carted them out to
Orange. All their workers followed. Houses and
shops and pubs and things were pulled down and taken
to Orange, too, and even the s.p. men moved out
there.
By 1945 you could travel from Parramatta to
Summer Hill and hardly meet a soul, except an odd
bagman camped in the ruins and an occasional visitor
from the bush looking for an address.
The Government of the day, newly-elected on its
“Stop the Drift to the Country” policy, tried all sorts
of things to induce people to remain in the city. But
by this time they were getting letters from friends
and relatives in Orange, Bathurst, Cowra, Mudgee
and other points, as well as from the new towns at
Port Stephens, Lake Macquarie, Kiama and Tug-
gerah, all telling of the lovely fresh water to be had
and how clean and bracing the air was and how well
the youngsters were doing, not to mention the strange
fact that husbands and fathers seldom felt exhausted
after a day’s work as they had in the old days.
This was about the time somebody discovered a
water supply beneath the Eastern Suburbs railway and
the Government urged people to remain in the city.
But they were getting samples of the cheap meat, eggs,
fruit, milk and other things that their transplanted
friends had in abundance in their new homes ; and
steadily the drift west, north and south went on.
By 1948, with the war over and still no water on
the catchments, there were towns blossoming all over
the inland slopes, particularly towards Riverina and
north-west to Tamworth ; there were factories fading
from Sydney and reappearing in pleasant surroundings
elsewhere.
Desperate, the Government had long since sacked
the Water Board and the Rain Department and set
up a board to control both. The Sydney daily papers
published bitter criticisms of the Government’s failure
to stop the drift. They all saw the fell hand of Mel-
bourne in the whole thing.
But by now captains of industry were finding that
people worked better in country districts, and there
were fewer strikes and more co-operation. By 1950
the population of Sydney was about 250,000, mostly
civil servants and out-of-work members of boards and
commissions, with a scattering of foreigners, tourists,
socialites, night-club girls and diehards whom an earth-
quake couldn’t have shifted. Still the rainfall refused
to happen on the old catchments and still the drift to
the outer districts went on.
The State election of 1952 will be for ever memor-
able. Parties no longer had a city to legislate for.
They couldn’t offer to build underground railways,
water schemes or open up new suburbs because
nobody wanted them. There was no city money for
party funds. “S.M.H.” was the one daily newspaper
left, and it only awaited completion of its new build-
ing at Molong before shutting up altogether in Sydney.
Further, the people no longer wanted a State Par-
liament. They had already set up regional councils
in the new districts and invited the Commonwealth
Parliament to attend to national matters. Speakers
arose to declare that the birthrate had jumped in the
newly-populated areas, together with material produc-
tion, and there was a vast and growing home market
for farmers. The land was being cut up and effi-
ciently worked, and there was a stream of immigrants
from other parts of Australia and overseas. In what
had been known as N. S. Wales there were 150
daily papers, 75 weeklies, four opera houses and over
500 free libraries, and tremendous advances had been
made in many other ways. New motor roads and civil
aerodromes spread rapidly.
The result was that the people refused to vote. On
election day the polls remained unpolled, as it were,
and in several towns pubs were picketed and forced
to keep open. In mournful tones the retiring Premier
told the House the awful truth ; then he sold out and
went to the bush. The ex-Parliament wandered miser-
ably about the neglected and fast-emptying city,
brooded awhile on the Water Board palace in Pitt-
street and then swiftly faded away.
The following year there was a great gathering
near Condobolin at the geographical centre of the
State. The Prime Minister, in the presence of a score
of presidents of regional councils, solemnly unveiled
a great statue of Jupiter Pluvius, erected by a grate-
ful people to show how much his failure had meant to
them.
After that, Sydney recovered slightly. It became
a busy little port and did a thriving business with tour-
ists from the inland and up and down the coast who
came to gaze on the huge bridge, the caves of the
underground and other silent monuments to the blind-
ness of their fathers.
C. H. S.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Send Cameron!
The Australian people had to wait three months for a
statement from the Australian Goveinment as to
H.M.A.S. Australia’s part in the Dakar fiasco ; and
all they got then was a Ministerial confirmation of
newspaper reports, expressed in a few-score words.
The 10,000-ton cruiser, according to Mr. Hughes,
was hit by six-inch shells and suffered “superficial
damage” ; none of the crew was killed, but the Seagull
’plane was lost with Lieut.-Commander Fogarty and
Leading Telegraphist Burnett. On the other hand,
the Australia’s gunners hit a French destroyer and
set her on fire, to become “probably” a total loss. And
it was a speedboat from the Australia that put the
battleship Richelieu out of action.
The newspaper reports were far more informa-
tive. One described the Seagull ’plane as “obsolete,”
and mentioned that the gallant Fogarty and Burnett
were last seen “swimming in shark-infested waters.”
It was not mentioned by Mr. Hughes or any other
Minister whether the Government was advised of the
intention to employ H.M.A.S. Australia in an operation
which would have been unpredictable three months
before, or whether it gave its consent. A debate on
Dakar was promised by the Minister of External
Affairs on November 28, but the promise has not
been kept.
Possibly a Special Correspondent of “S. M.
Herald” has been authorised to speak for the Govern-
ment. Anyway, the Special has asserted that “Aus-
tralia was informed neither that the [Dakar] enter-
prise had been launched nor that it had failed and
had been abandoned.” Wherefore “Mr. Menzies sent
to Mr. Churchill in protest the most strongly-worded
cable that any Australian Prime Minister has sent to
a British leader.”
If this is a fact, “the most strongly-worded cable”
had no effect on the Downing-street policy of keeping
Canberra in the dark. Four days after the commence-
ment of the offensive in Western Egypt Canberra was
unable to satisfy the people’s thirst for information as
to whether the A.I.F. or the R.A.A.F. was engaged
in it. In these matters, Australia has to depend on
newspaper and radio reporters for facts which it has
a right to expect from its own Government.
There is talk of Mr. Menzies going to London
during the recess, perhaps accompanied by Mr. Curtin.
It would be much better to send Mr. Cameron and a
small staff of professional advisers, preceded by the
intimation that Downing-street will be expected to find
a place for him on the War Council, if not in an
Imperial War Cabinet. Mr. Cameron’s remarks on
the childlike way in which service Ministers discourse
to the press, on the absence of these Ministers from
the House when the estimates for which they are sup-
posed to be responsible were under discussion and on
related matters had an extraordinary effect on a
Chamber which had seemed to be half-asleep or half-
dead and were read with absolute sympathy by the
public. Someone is urgently needed in London to
stand up for Australia’s interests and rights, and there
is no better man in sight.
Scamping Their Job Again.
From the Prime Minister down, Ms.H.R. got very
heated over a little juggling with pictures indulged in
by Hobart “Mercury,” which claimed that they were
used “in a symbolic sense to show in telling pictorial
contrast the difference in London and Canberra.” The
top picture was of a scene of desolation in London ;
the bottom (obviously faked for the purpose) showed
the House of Representatives with only seven people
present. Beside them, under the heading “Farce in
House,” the paper published a dispatch from its Can-
berra correspondent describing a Budget debate which
petered out in a failure to raise a quorum.
Mr. Menzies —possibly feeling the strain of the
past few weeks —let himself go:
There can be no doubt that the picture is a gross
piece of fraud. Unhappily, this kind of campaign
against Parliament —inspired, I presume, by those who
are opposed to the Parliamentary system—has been
carried on for some time. This photograph is the
grossest example of this kind of propaganda I have seen.
It was tricky, no doubt, and unnecessarily so. The
“Mercury” could have taken a much more striking
photograph when members were struggling at a series
of all-night sittings to get rid of the biggest and most
complicated Budget on record, together with the
associated tax-bills and a heap of other measures dis-
posing of huge amounts. To get the picture it would
have had to break the rules, but towards the end of the
proceedings, which, beginning at 2.30 p.m. on Tues-
day, were kept going till 6 p.m. on Friday, with breaks
only for meals and brief morning spells, so many
members were asleep, half-asleep or half-dead that the
“Mercury” photographers and their oufit would
scarcely have been noticed.
While the gentlemen were comparatively fresh,
they pointed out fantastic anomalies in the new sales-
tax schedule, and there are anomalies as fantastic in
the new income-tax schedule. But three consecutive
“all-nighters” extinguished the spirit of criticism,
except in isolated cases, and sales-tax schedule (with
the tax on books and periodicals omitted), income-tax
schedule and estimates were shoved through with all
the expedition of which minds dazed with lack of sleep
were capable.
Towards the end of the marathon the only person
who imparted any ginger to the “discussions” was Mr.
Cameron. The member for Barker was characteristi-
cally trenchant on the loss of £750,000 on the apple
and pear pool (that appalling business alone should
have been debated for at least a day), on the babbling
of service Ministers to the newspapers, on their
absence from the House when the Defence Co-ordina-
tion vote came on, and on that amazing dud the
Department of Information, on which £198,000 is to
be spent this year. His vigorous remarks brought
Ministers running back into the Chamber, and the
House, now half-awake, went into a secret sitting. But
even Mr. Cameron was worn out at last, and the
P.M.G.’s estimates, on which he had intended to take
a fall out of A.8.C., were bullocked through at 7 a.m.
on Friday without debate. At 6 a.m. he had suggested
an adjournment for breakfast, there being then “30
persons in the House, of whom more than 20 were
snoring in different keys.” “Not on your life ; we
are going through!” replied Treasurer Fadden, and
“through” they went.
And that was the way in which the House did the
most important job it was ever called upon to do!
In that fashion it performed its duty to the people from
whose pockets more money is to be taken than ever
before (and the Senate meekly said “ditto” as usual)!
Why wasn’t time found for the proper discussion of
the intricate taxation measures and for a line-by-line
examination of the estimates, on which there are liter-
ally scores of challengeable items? Because Ministers
and members wanted to get away from Canberra in
good time “for Christmas,” and because some of
them wanted to speak to the Swan electors. Dr.
Evatt, whose advent to Parliament was greeted with
such a chorus of applause, found the call of the Swan
by-election so commanding that he wasn’t even seen
in the House during the 75-hour sitting. He was “on
his way to the West to assist in the Labor candidate’s
campaign.”
Before Parliament adjourned (“probably till
March”!) the Prime Minister returned to the subject
of the “Mercury” picture, and talked of asking the
War Council to suggest a way of “giving legitimate
protection to the Parliamentary institution.” It is the
nation that needs protection against such utterly dis-
graceful methods of doing its business as were wit-
nessed last week.
Insanity and Murder.
“Pawang”: In Melbourne the other day a jury found
a man “not guilty” of the murder of his son and
daughter “on the ground of insanity” (“guilty, but
insane,” is the much more sensible British formula),
and, on Chief Justice Mann’s order, he is to be kept
in gaol during the Governor’s pleasure. The victims
were found in their home at West Coburg on Oct. 11
with their heads battered. Their father was rescued
from the Coburg lake, after leaving notes indicating
that he intended to drown himself.
It transpired at the trial that he had been obsessed
with dread of insanity, having learnt that his grand-
mother had died in an asylum and that his father had
been stricken with paralysis. From his reading he had
deduced that certain diseases and final mental paralysis
were caused by a dreadful malady, and he had had a
dread and horror all his life about it. On the day of
the tragedy something went snap in his brain. There
was no evidence to show that he had the malady of
which he thought he was the predestined victim.
By a coincidence, in the last three weeks there
have been two plays and several films in Melbourne
which have the same theme as the grim actuality at
West Coburg, except that they culminate in self-
destruction instead of murder. In “Children of the
Moon” a girl decides that she cannot marry or have
children because there is a hereditary belief in her
family that they come from the moon. She feels the
curse descending on her, and goes out and commits
suicide with her lover. “A Bill of Divorcement” was
a similar story.
In none of these plays or pictures is there any
more understanding of the problem than was shown at
the murder trial in Melbourne. The accused said that
his married life had been happy, his wife having been
a “magnificent woman,” but she fell sick. Then he
mortgaged his business. Eventually he found himself
in a sea of troubles. A psychiatrist said that this was
almost the textbook description of such a case, with
homicidal and suicidal tendencies.
A few minutes’ conversation would probably
have made it impossible for the man at West Coburg
to believe that he was on the road to an asylum and
that killing his son and daughter was the only way
out of his troubles.
o
Organising for Victory.
Young Mr. Holt is full of highfalutin notions about
“great expansion of the activities of the Labor and
Social Service Department.” He seems to think he’s in
charge of a department store or something, and pro-
poses to apply himself to the business of putting Aus-
tralians to work with all the enthusiasm and shadowy
vision of an American efficiency expert.
He proposes a central organisation for research
into the man- and woman-power of Australia —every
individual to be put into the job he is best fitted to
fill. There will be a main office and secretariat at Can-
berra, with divisions throughout the country and
bureaux in the shires.
The department will cover the field in several general
divisions —employment, industrial relationships, industrial
training, industrial welfare, records, analysis of results,
national service and post-war reconstruction. The move-
ment of trained workers has to be controlled.
There is a lot more of it, all couched in terms long
familiar to officialdom, and opening up a splejndid vista
of secretaries and under-secretaries, corridors filled
with filing cabinets, uniformed messengers standing
firm outside closed doors, and Commonwealth Labor
Bureau buildings going up all over the place.
But Mr. Holt doesn’t intend to stop there. He has
an idea of establishing a Bureau of Home Economics,
where the housewife, struggling to make ends meet on
what the old man has left after Mr. Holt’s new depart-
ment has received its share of his pay envelope, can get
advice, “for instance, in the most economic use of
family resources.” As if housewives hadn’t long since
learned more than Mr. Holt’s Bureau, staffed probably
with accountants, costing clerks and graduates from
domestic-science schools, could ever teach them.
Mr. Holt is fully prepared for reactions. Pos-
sibly assuming that his wonderful department will
create a good deal of leisure for the regimented toilers
he proposes
to launch a national service movement next year because
the best use had not been made of the desire of people
to take some practical part in the war effort —at night,
on odd free days, and at week-ends. Establishment
of national service centres in every shire and munici-
pality would develop the fervor essential to the war
effort. The centres could also be used for registration of
people available for employment.
Taken by and large, Mr. Holt promises to be an
interesting young man, though when the country
comes to pay the “interest” it may fail to appreciate
him. _
A New Order for the Empire.
A good many Australians have long been convinced
that, had British money poured into the Dominions at
anything like the rate it poured into places like
Rumania, the Empire would have become so strong
that no dictator or set of dictators would have
cherished the notion that it could be overthrown.
It isn’t hard to imagine the effect on the dictator
mind of an Australia, a Canada, a Maoriland, a South
Africa with three or four times the present population,
and with an Empire Defence Council using a powerful
navy and air force in a grand strategy for keeping the
peace. Nor is it hard to imagine the tremendous part
India could have played in such an Empire.
Unfortunately, in spite of all that has come to
pass, few Empire politicians are Empire-minded. Mr.
George Gibson, chairman of the British Trades Union
Congress, seems to be different.
Mr. Gibson wants the British and Dominion Gov-
ernments to resolve that the Empire will no longer
be a closed book to most of its people after the war.
He wants ocean travel cheapened between Empire
countries and special facilities afforded to Empire
travellers setting foot in Empire countries. Not the
sort of facilities recently given in Australia to a bunch
of fly-by-night Yankee journalists, who were greeted
by officialdom with the kind of reverence that Hodge
accords to Squire, but a body that “will do for Empire
travel what the motor-bus has done for rural com-
munities, the big caterer for the cafeteria and the rail-
way excursion for the district.”
Mr. Gibson suggests the conversion of liners
into special ships for the carriage of trippers
about the Empire, people who would, by forgoing
two or three years’ annual holidays, so save time and
money for the trip. He wants a system of exchange
on the lines of the present teaching exchanges whereby
a London bus-driver could exchange for six months
with a Melbourne bus-driver, a Canadian ranch-hand
with an Australian boundary-rider and so on. Also,
an inter-Empire system of travelling scholarships for
children.
The idea is full of possibilities. It is a people’s
idea from a man of the people. Its educational re-
actions would be tremendous. If some of the ex-
changed or visiting British decided to stay in one or
other of the Empire countries, all the better. The
more the notion is thought about the more attractive
it becomes. All those people talking about new orders
after the war might, with profit, give it their serious
attention.
Maoriland Is Different Again.
A young Sydney woman, spouting in the street for a
so-called No-Conscription League, fell foul of the
police. Convicted on two charges, possession of
printed matter bearing no imprint and publication of
statements prejudicial to what Moscow agents have
the face to call “this Imperialist war,” she appealed
to Quarter Sessions.
For attendants when the appeal was heard she
had a curiously large number of sympathisers of her
own sex, all presumably members of the No-
Conscription League. To their indignation there were
no seats for them in court, a sufficient number of
policemen, forewarned that a demonstration was in-
tended, having beaten them fo the seats. Judge Stacey
upheld the appeal on the printed-matter charge, but
dismissed the other, though he reduced the fine. He
offered to let the woman go on her entering into a
good-behavior bond, but she elected to take the alterna-
tive —a month in prison. Next morning there was a
picture of her in one of the flapper papers—the same
which periodically proclaimed that Stalin was on
Our Side and controlled “the mightiest force of which
history has record.”
That same morning the Maoriland papers came
out with the names of 14,000 young men who had
been called up for overseas service under the Labor
Government’s conscription law, the names having been
gazetted while the Sydney appeal case was being
heard. The note struck in all these papers was that
it was a proud day in the history of the Dominion,
and it was recalled that in the last war, when the
population was much smaller, 100,000 Maorilanders,
of whom 32,270 had been enrolled under the Military
Service Act, 1916, served in France, Flanders, Egypt,
Palestine and Syria. No bands of women assembled
to protest against the 1940 call-up—in fact, there was
no demonstration of any description.
They order these things better in Labor Maori-
land. If any mob calling itself a No-Conscription
League showed itself in public it would get short shrift,
and if it were found expedient to take photographs
they would appear, not in flapper papers, but in
the Rogues’ Gallery.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Harold Hardupp”: The spirit blossoms
early in the youngsters. Dad had prof-
fered the usual pocket-money, but the
two small boys stood solidly before him
and declined it. “We want more than
that,” said the elder firmly ; and he pul it
that they had reached an age which
should raise them above the financial
standards of “little kids.” Dad made a
move to quell the rebellion by returning
the coins to his pocket with the remark
that if they didn’t want the money he
dared say he could spend it himself. But
his eight-year-old wasn’t quenched. “Be
reasonable, dad,” he urged. “It’s two
years ago since you started giving us
sixpence a week each. Well, the cost of
living has gone up since then.” The
youngsters won.

“D.E.”: “Iconoclast” (B. 11/12/ ’4O)
agrees with “Dick Tafone” (B.
20/11/ ’4O) that the “Times” “is either
ignorant or rude in ignoring the title of
doctor gained by Hugh Dalton, M.P.”
Having unwittingly started the argument,
I suggest that these indignant worthies
should now fall on the conductors of
Commonwealth “Hansard.” Herbert
Vere Evatt has been a Doctor of Laws
since 1924, but in “Hansard” he figures
as plain “Mr. Evatt (Barton).” Similarly,
the P.M.’s recent offsider is “Mr. Archie
Cameron (Barker),” though nearly all the
papers—even those which delight in
referring to his elastic-side boots—call
him “Major” Cameron. Like the
“Times,” “Hansard” is run by old hands
who know their business.
* * * *
“Polk”: When a trained Alsatian dog
owned by the N.S.W. police force
breathed her last the staidest Sydney paper
remarked that the animal “had aided the
police in the tracing of many criminals,”
a statement that seems a trifle exagger-
ated, though the following one that “she
had demonstrated her intelligence before
many people at the Showground” was
true. A lot of balderdash has been
written about these police dogs, and
many children have been “thrilled” by
their antics, but the crime wave hasn’t
noticeably receded since their advent, and
the public hasn’t had its faith in the
detective abilities of the force increased.
In fact, a good many people can be
found to suggest that the force should
leave circus capers to Wirths and con-
centrate on clearing up its big swag of
unsolved crime mysteries.
* * * *
“Tuart”: One of my private griefs as
a newspaperman is that John Norton
didn’t live long enough to address an
Open Letter to Bagdad Ben. John had
a daughter, a charming and clever girl,
for whom a bright career seemed to be
in prospect when, at 21, she came into
her share of the Norton estate —a gener-
ous creature, she celebrated her birthday
by making handsome public and private
gifts. But in an evil hour she went to
London, where she fell in with Bagdad
Ben, otherwise known as Shashoua. A
mysterious customer, handsome in an
Oriental fashion, Ben lived on his wits,
though he was supposed to be something
in the moneylending and motor-car line.
Miss Norton married him, and he pro-
ceeded to break her heart and spend as
much of her money as he could get hold
of. After two dreadful years, Mrs.
Shashoua left him, and John Bull, in his
matter-of-fact way, rose to the occasion
with a deportation order expelling Ben
to France. He was last heard of at Paris
in 1936, and if he got his deserts he is
there yet, lining up furtively in food
queues. Mrs. Shashoua returned to
Sydney, and early this year she died,
leaving estate worth £71,000 ; subject to
legacies amounting to £2500, she willed
half to her brother Ezra, John Norton’s
successor in the direction of “Truth,” and
half to her mother, with remainder to
her brother. Shashoua came into the
picture again on application for grant
of probate, for the marriage was never
dissolved, and the question of domicile
arose. An order was issued that the will
should be admitted for probate, so there
can be nothing for Bagdad Ben.

“Strict Veg.”: The old Revelations
prophecy business cropped up in Mel-
bourne again recently, but was speedily
demolished. Some ingenious individual
discovered that the number 666, which
is the number of the Beast in Revelations,
applied to Hitler and wrote to the
“Argus” about it. Somebody promptly
retorted that an orator on the Domain
once proved with chalk and blackboard
“Der Fuehrer's orders are to sink everytink on sight.”
that it applied to Tommy Bent, then
Premier of Victoria. The original
prophet hasn’t since been heard of.
“Calathumpian”: Moved by what he
felt to be “a higher impulse,” an ancient
person galloped round to Sydney “D.T.”
and inserted three classified advts. call-
ing on the faithful to be of good cheer,
for the end of Hitler was nigh, his
authority for the statement being Habak-
kuk, ch. 2, in the Good Book. Where-
upon, cheered by this new trend in classi-
fieds, the editor of the “D.T.” put in a
par. calling attention to these works, and
dragging out extracts from Hab. to prove
that the space-buyer had, as the “D.T.’s”
American gods would say, “something
there.” I was taught at Sunday-school
that what old Habakkuk was talking
about was a scornful crowd of Chaldeans
who had the gall to sneer at the tinpot
kings with which Palestine was littered.
Possibly the “D.T.” never went to Sum
day-school.

“Cine Ma”: There being a shortage of
theatres and a surplus of audience in
picture-going Melbourne, spruiking has
become almost a lost art. When the
flicks were struggling into recognition the
spruiker was more important than ads.
in the dailies. Competition between two
Bourke-street houses was desperately keen
and their spruikers nightly roared them-
selves hoarse in an endeavor to get the ear
of the public. One evening one of them
paused for breath and as he did so heard
himself saying: “Don’t come in here—
the show’s rotten! Go across the street.”
He was paralysed with astonishment, and
then, looking across the way, he saw a
grin on the face of his professional
antagonist. That person, once a stage
ventriloquist, was taking a dastardly
advantage of him.

“Cauboy”: Under authority granted
by the Melbourne Health Commission,
“standing room only” is to be allowed
in city picture theatres, the excuse being
that managements are stung to the quick
at having to refuse the poor Digger on
leave a look at Joan Crawford. But
surely the Health Commission is sup-
posed to look after the health and the
safety of the public, not the piofits of
picture-theatre proprietors It is p eaded
that in the event of fire the back-stander
will be near the exits, will get out first
and thus not impede the rest of the audi-
ence By this argument the more peopte
standing the safer for the si ters. But
the Heahh Commission has never both-
ered much about log;?.

“El V.”: A little inauer in which Aus-
tralian newspapers are backward is in the
signatures they carry on their articles.
In this respect Uncle Sam’s press has
them knocked hollow ; but I didn’t really
realise what the psychological effect of a
name can be till I picked up a copy of a
recent New York “Herald Tribune.” Who
could fail to believe that Willkie is “a
veritable one-man revolution against all
the forces of evil, corruption and igno-
ranee that would destroy us” when
the news is purveyed by somebody who
signs himself Laurence P. Moomau?
And who could fail to realise that coal
is a neglected asset when the momentous
intelligence comes from Lilia van Slyke
Harder? And say, are there any of you
bozos who don’t believe that Gibraltar is
Hitler’s next objective? The “Herald
Trib.” has it straight that Adolf is bound
for the Rock—from Prince Doushan
Lazarovich-Hrebelianovitch!

“Norther”: Tragedy never seems to let
some people alone. Three boys, aged 16,
12 and 11, members of a North
Coast (N.S.W.) family, set out to
gather firewood on the Tweed River.
They stripped off and went bathing
on a sandspit which falls steeply into deep
water. All three were drowned ; one,
it seems, fell into the deep water and the
others tried to save him. Two years ago
their eldest brother was killed in a cliff
fall; later on a sister was burnt to death
and another sister died of illness. So
only five of the original 11 children are
left, and their father is suffering from
ribs broken in an accident.

“Adelaide”: S.A. has had a rather
comical blackmail case. Heidenreich, a
miller by calling, and president of the
Norwood football team, received a long
manifesto from “The Master Ring” de-
manding £lOO “to show we are a
very strong unit; Germany will be in
possession of Australia by January Ist.”
The money was to be handed to an em-
ployee, a Norwood footballer, whom
“we have picked on to act” as go-
between. The police also picked on the
go-between, and soon he was admitting “I
had told my girl friend that I had £lOO in
the bank, and I wanted to prove it to
her.” In court he said that he had been
an awful fool, and was really sorry ; and
Judge Parsons, accepting both state-
ments, released him on a bond for good
behavior.

“Dick Tafone”: Sponsored this time
by the 8.M.A., Brisbane’s annual dress-
reform-for-men movement commenced
propaganda operations with the first
December hot spell, and shows every
indication of expiring as usual when
January temperatures make it too hot to
botber about arguing. Great Dailies

defends the tie as the last gaudy feather
left in the male plumage and as neces-
sary f or a lead up to the face as a handle
j s t 0 a tennis racket, but opponents argue
that the tennis-racket type of face is not
one to be cultivated. State Treasurer
Cooper believes that coats are indispen-
sable wear for the average citizen be-
cause they provide more pockets in which
to carry tax-money and things. Lud-
mayor Chandler doesn’t care how council
employees dress so long as they conform
with “reasonable requirements of decency,
good taste and dignity.” The only reason-
able person so far is an anonymous
administrator who would hate to cut
down the number of his pockets because
it would limit his wife’s interests in
searching them.

“X.S.”: A young man who was sen-
tenced to three months’ gaol for trying
to work a “protection” racket on Geelong
businessmen pleaded that he had been

“San Remo” tells the story of an
island:
In its sesquicentenary pride and enthusiasm
Melbourne completely forgot the claims of
Phillip Island. The opening of a 1760 ft.
bridge, the longest in the State, connecting the
pleasure isle with the mainland has drawn atten-
tion to the fact that Melbourne’s playground
first felt the pressure of white feet when George
Bass called there in H.M.S. Reliance 39 years
before Batman landed by the Yarra. Lieu-
tenant Grant, with a crew of convicts, made a
survey in 1801 and built a blockhouse, inci-
dentally naming it Churchill after a Devonshire
friend who had given him seeds of rice, peas,
maize and coffee beans, Grant having evinced
a desire to settle on the island. The place
became so popular with French navigators that
in 1825 the frightened Sydney authorities sent
Captains Wright and Wetherall with the inevit-
able convicts to make a permanent fort and
settlement. They found the island well occupied
by white sealers with abo. wives and children.
In 1828, the French threat having diminished,
the settlement was abandoned and the island
had to be rediscovered a decade later from
Melbourne. Phillip Island is a tourist resort
noted for its muttonbirds and for the koalas
which cluster in gum-tree grandstands by the
roadside and watch with cynical amusement the
smashes at Hell’s Corner when the island stages
its annual motor-racing frenzy. Barking seals
and penguins and an abo. kitchen midden are
other attractions.
THE PRICE OF BEER.
“Move than 300 men at the Chullova (N.S.W.)
railway workshops resolved to become total abstainers
for a month as a protest against the increased price
of beer. Similar measures are threatened by other
trade-unions.”
You may “soak the rich” as much as you like,
They’re short of methods for going on strike,
When income takes are sharply “riz”
By those who manage the nation’s biz,
But the prudent statesman who minds his stops
Will shrink from meddling with malt and hops.
A British Ministry once there was
That got it hard in the neck because,
Planning economies severe,
It laid a hand on the people’s beer.
Full many a cause, deemed lost by some,
Has been won in the end by martyrdom
Of the gallant diehards, the valiant few
Who were game to suffer as well as do.
Think of enfranchised woman’s debts
To the irrepressible suffragettes!
And think of the toilers spitting chips
From arid patches through parching lips
As a protest eloquent, stern, sincere,
Against the jump in the price of beer!
The blow, I trow, had been less severe
In any other part of the year
Than when thermometers upward climb
And pumps should be working overtime,
And never a greeting has more allures
Than lie in those two crisp words “What’s
yours?”
So here’s to those who their thirsts must quell
In a sturdy fight for a principle!
How ill it sorts with our Christmas cheer,
This extra bit on the price of beer!
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“ Ha-a-nds to breakfast !”
“Gumdigger”: Most surprising patient
I ever had in the chair was a
lady who came in for some extractions.
Anaesthetic was administered and the
teeth came out. As she slowly regained
consciousness, she upturned a drowsy eye
and murmured: “Well, thank God that’s
over ; is it a boy or a girl?”
* * * *
“Tummas McNark”: Amid all the
blather in the flapper and near-flapper
press about the “marvellous” work being
done by women’s organisations in this
war, most of it accompanied by pictures
of legsome females in anything from
naval rigout to the uniform of a Guards
drum-major, it was refreshing to come
across this in a Melbourne religious
paper: “A lady general should be
regarded as a freak, like the horse-
marines.” The paper points out that
there is an outcry in England over the
shortage of nurses, and suggests it is time
young women took stock of themselves.
In this hour of greatest crisis, when Eng-
land expects every woman to do her duty,
not nurses and mothers are forthcoming,
but lady generals, colonels, majors, cap-
tains.
I had thought of sending a copy along
to various editors, but, apoplexy being
what it is in these summer days, I decided
to go and have a beer with the stamp-
money, only to run full-tilt into a lieu-
tenant-admiraless or something. Her icy
glare cooled me off, and I went back to
toil with the same chilly feeling a worm
must know when eyed by the cold optic
of a fowl.

“Si Anu”: Possibly Noel Coward got
that notion (B. 11/12/ ’4O) from our
brothers of Malaya. The Malay
has a word, hati, which looks sus-
piciously like “heart” but actually
means liver. He places the seat of
all the emotions in the liver, which is
just as sensible and physiologically exact
as to place it in the heart, as we do.
Where we say stout-hearted he says stout-
livered, and where we say sweetheart he
says fruit of the liver, which sounds just
as poetic to the dusky damsel of Kuala
Lumpur.

“Sixenate”: Christmas brings an
amnesty to drunks, who are paraded and
sent away with the best wishes of the
law; but a man who faced a Sydney
Court with the lame excuse for his car-
nival of riot that “Y’know it’s Christmas-
time, y’r Worship,” was premature and
was regarded with a cold eye. The
magistrate remarked drily that Christmas
Day was still some way off, and he asked
the prosecuting cop to repeat the charges.
The bloke who now had to answer for
them had danced and sung in the street,
holding up traffic; he had belted his
wife, who had tried to restrain him ; had
broken a window and in other ways
played Ancient Henry, and had fought
two Johns who had finally arrested him.
Looking hurt at the Law’s cold treatment
of his first plea, the defendant followed
the recitation with his explanation—
“Well, I must have thought it was
Christmas, your Worship,” he said.

“Kirkcudbright”: Tell “D.E.” (B.
11/12/ ’4O) that if the derivation of
Roosevelt’s name is Dutch it should be
pronounced “Roserfelt,” as near as I can
phoneticise it, “oo” in that lingo having
the sound of “o” and “oe” having the
sound of “oo,” or as near as a non-
Hollander can make it.
* * * *
“Burglar’s Laborer”: Another of the
getaways which were plentiful in Sydney
has been blocked by the new building that
replaces old Vickery’s Chambers in Pitt-
street. Formerly the man who
saw the Law or his missus in
pursuit could dive down a lane
off Castlereagh-street, across a
parking-station, through the
labyrinth of passages in
Vickery’s and back again by
another lane to Castlereagh-
street. Now he would run slap
into a new brick wall. Once it
was possible to travel from a
point near Circular Quay to
Central Station by using rights of
way through office and other
buildings without once touching
a street corner. Citizens of
former days were jealous of
these rights even if their only
use for them was as short cuts
to work or from it to a pub. One
(known to few but the users)
between George-street and Pitt-street,
near the Quay, still exists because of the
riot that was raised when a building
erected 40 years ago blocked the Pitt-
street end. A passage through that build-
ing is still kept open night and day as a
result of the fuss raised by the “right
by custom” claimants. But today nobody
squeals when one of the old rights of
way disappears.
* * * *
“Pawang”: Prof. Osborne, of Mel-
bourne, remarked the other day: “Don’t
tax books, tax lipstick!” If taxes could
get the paint off young women’s faces I
would say good for the professor. But
will they? A Melbourne beautician esti-
mates that the average smart business-
girl or salesgirl spends £lB 7s. per annum
on lipstick, permanent waves, face
powder, nail lacquer, perfume, eyebrow
pencils, mascara, liquid suntan, rouge,
bath salts, foundation creams, astringents,
cleansing creams, hand lotions, skin
foods, manicures and face massages, in
addition to £l2 p.a. on stockings. So she
evidently believes that that is the way to
attain to beauty, and will no more give it
up if taxed than men will give up beer
and tobacco.

. “Old Borstalian”: Though there’s still
plenty of shootin’ and probably some
fishin’ in England, huntin’ is hoff.
You don’t hear the horn winding nor
see hounds spill over a brook these days,
most of the quality either huntin’ bigger
game in the skies or chasing “vacees”
round the homestead. In 1914-18 the
sport nearly went west. There was a big
drain on horses, and at the height of the
submarine campaign in T 7 a lot of people
were asking questions about the food
hounds consumed. Many packs were
destroyed, others went to U.S.A., and it
looked like finish. But the sport came
again, and by last year its devotees were
spending upwards of £500,000 annuaily
on it. The pink-coat business never made
much headway in Australia, and looks
like taking the knock here more so than
in England. Melbourne Hunt Club has
destroyed half its hounds and offered
its clubhouse and other buildings for a
military camp site.

“Tuart”: Touching that reference to
Byron (B. 4/12/’4O), I have been reading
the poet’s account of his campaign in
Greece as recorded in his racy letters. He
lent the Greek Government £4OOO,
besides maintaining a force of volunteers
at his own charge (“225 regulars and
irregulars—l had 550 of the latter, but
when they quarrelled among themselves
.... I boomed them off”). A letter to the
Greek Government dated November 30,
1823, is worth quoting.
You have fought gloriously. Act honor-
ably towards your fellow-citizens and the
world and it will then no more be said,
as has been repeated for 2000 years with
the Roman historians, that Philopcemen
was the last of the Grecians.
Byron’s men were a mixed and intractable
lot: Suliotes, Swedes, Germans and
“Capt. Parry’s English artificers.” “The
smartest shock of an earthquake” brought
trouble.
The whole army discharged their arms,
upon the same principle that savages beat
drums or howl during an eclipse of the
moon. It was a rare scene altogether.
If you had but seen the English Johnnies,
who had never been out of a Cockney
workshop before!
The poet was arranging to back the
Greeks with “$5OOO every two months”
when the Missolonghi fever got him. No
wonder his name is honored in Greece,
if not in his own country.

“Pawang”: “Colonel Bungstarter” (B.
11/12 / ’4O) corrects me for saying that
Sandow was a consumptive weakling at
20, and I must accept his correction ;
but I don’t agree that the Sandow system
immensely improved white-man physique
and stamina. Certainly it didn’t do it
for me. When the Sandow boom started
in this country I, along with other adoles-
cents, was violently affected. Stripped
to the buff in the middle of winter, I
solemnly stood in front of a mirror lift-
ing half-ton dumb-bells 110 times this
way and 110 times that way two hours
a day, night and morning, without pro-
ducing the slightest observable effect on
my physical structure. Many of my
friends and relations sprouted bulging
biceps and chests like pouter pigeons,
but as they all had sedentary occu-
pations and needed to develop their
brains rather than their muscles, they
became flabbier than I was as soon
as the Sandow boom evaporated. The
inference is that they would have
developed their physiques just as well by
manual labor as they did by Eugene s
system. Which makes me think that the
present National Fitness campaign is a
silly notion run by academic professors.
“ Major-General and Admiral Potts Point!”
THE DISGRUNTLED PUNTER.
“A man, described by the magistrate as a dis-
gruntled punter, was fined £5 at Central Police
Court for creating a disturbance at Randwick.”
There are people in various positions
Who, stirred by some setback that narks,
Are given to fierce ebullitions
And highly explosive remarks.
But the loudest and angriest roaring
At fortune will often, we know,
Be raised by some punter deploring
The loss of his dough.
He’s sure there was something that’s “funny,”
Some business markedly crook,
That parted himself from his money,
And he’d like to bring someone to book.
It may be the jock who was got at,
Or the owner whose guile he decries;
And after the pair have been shot at
He rails at the “Sties.”
You may sense his unshaken conviction
A victim of knaves he’s been made
By his vivid and violent diction,
Plain proof of a temper that’s frayed.
It’s hard on the homecoming hunter
No luck on the hill who has had,
And harder perhaps for the punter
Who’s backed the wrong prad.
There’ll ever be losers and winners
As oft as the numbers go up
To show if the Ikes have had skinners
Or a favorite’s landed the Cup.
Should you catch a disconsolate bellow
In the midst of the cheers, let it pass.
It’s just some irascible fellow
Who’s blewed his good brass.

POLITICAL POINTS
Discussion of the Budget should have
taken at least a month, as months are
counted at Canberra. Having compro-
mised on income tax, company tax, old-
age pensions and the rest, the members
of the sixteenth House went through the
form of discussing the thing in 75 hours,
and during the last 25 hours most of
those who weren’t asleep on the benches
looked punch-drunk. Evatt wasn’t among
them—having said in grave tones that
“Parliamentary democracy” was “on
trial,” he rushed over to the West for
the Swan by-election. Parliamentary
democracy is on trial, and members who
make such a mockery of Parliamentary
control of the public purse are selling the
pass to Bureaucracy.
Menzies has divested himself of one of
his offices, Foil being now Minister of
Information. Foil talks of “reducing the
censorship to a minimum.” While there
are loose-tongued Ministers and stunting
newspapers about, together with provo-
cative spruikers “sponsored by the
Department of Information,” this will be
difficult; but Foil might well reduce the
£198,000 to be played up this year on
the Department of Information to about
tuppence-ha’penny.
It used to be the custom to reserve the
Defence portfolio for the fool of the
family. Now the fool of the family is
shoved into External Affairs.
Stewart’s statements on foreign affairs
are as dull as McEwen’s were, and they are
even more provocative. Twice this Min-
ister has made a clumsy and quite un-
necessary reference to the country in
which Australia is about to have a dis-
tinguished representative who never opens
his mouth too wide, and on the second
occasion he added some gratuitous re-
marks about an enemy, now a fit subject
for skilful propaganda.
Little wonder that the military and naval
chiefs of Italy are finding their positions
untenable, and, in purely Italian style, are
themselves running for shelter.
Then the gentleman tried his hand at
French politics:
The withdrawal of the Commonwealth
Government’s official recognition of the
French Consul-General (M. Tremoulet) will
mean a strong accession to the De Gaulle
Movement.
One of Stewart’s prize pigs could do
better.
On Fremantle, Kalgoorlie and Senate
figures Labor has a very poor chance of
capturing Swan ; but Dr. Evatt has made
the long railway journey to the West in
a hopeful spirit. Two of the four candi-
dates are having a private fight over
again: Claude Osmond Barker, of Litch-
fields (A/sia), and Ferguson, formerly
deputy-leader of the State Country party,
whom Barker beat for the Irwin-Moore
Assembly seat, though Barker never
actually occupied it. The others are Dig-
nan, the Curtin Labor man, who was a
bad second to Gregory at the general
election, and ex-Senator Marwick, the
late member’s running mate. In West-
ralia Marwick is voted the best chance.
Some of the British Labor Ministers
have fallen under the displeasure
of newspapers that were so recently
praising them to the skies. Attlee is now
dismissed as “dull,” Greenwood as
“gloomy” and Bevin, who got most of
the butter, as “timorous” —this because
he refuses to accede to their demands for
the conscription of Labor. The unstable
sheets will be at Churchill yet, though
with a great effort they abstained from
slating him after Dakar. The truth seems
to be that Churchill learned something
from Dakar; anyway, he has had the
good sense not to interfere with the excel-
lent R.N. and R.A.F. plans for helping
Greece, or with the masterly measures
of the three services in Western Egypt.
For denouncing war-time strikers in
good set terms, Hogan, the Victorian
Minister of Agriculture, has been bitterly
attacked by Laborites whose leader he
was for so many years. Cain, the present
leader, joined in on the Assembly floor
in Hogan’s absence; he asserted that
when Hogan stood for Warrenheip for the
first time he had come from “leading a
timber-workers’ strike” in Westralia, and
that Warrenheip opponents accused him
of having said to the timber-workers,
“Bring your axes with you, boys ; you
might want them.” Hogan replied
through the newspapers, Parliament hav-
ing gone into recess, saying that the one
statement not questioned was that he had
come from Westralia. He gave Cain the
choice of repeating his allegations in
AND A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY—NEARLY ALL.
public or apologising. Cain has found
another alternative—silence.
In the last war there was mountainous
waste, and, in spite of all the promises
of amendment, the appalling tradition is
being followed. It is admitted that “be-
tween £12,000 and £14,000” was thrown
away in a crazy attempt to estab-
lish an air-training centre in dusty
Southern Cross (W.A.), and Westralians
familiar with the fiasco aver that even
£14,000 is a gross underestimate. And a
cool £750,000 has been taken from tax-
revenue to meet losses on the apple and
pear pool. If half of what has been said
in Parliament is true, no small part of
the £750,000 went into the pockets of
cheats and tricksters, but criminal prose-
cutions are not even hinted at.
Supporting Scullin’s plea for unification
of taxation, Spooner stated that seven
years at Loan Councils had convinced
him that the financial powers of the
States were doomed. And it took him
seven years to find that out!
What Hitler said in his speech to the
Berlin armament workers was not so
remarkable as what he didn’t say. He
didn’t once mention his distressed Italian
partner. The effort itself, with its fre-
quent, though familiar, suggestion that
the orator was about to take a fit, was
less impressive than the sequel—a full-
throated singing' of Luther’s “Ein Fester
Burg Ist Unser Gott,” the air of which
is familiar to all English-speaking Chris-
tians. The “Horst Wessel” song which
followed was more in keeping with the
occasion—at least, it didn’t seem to in-
voke the blessing of Providence on the
Blitzkrieg.
A lot of rot is being talked about
the alleged shortage of skilled labor for
shipbuilding and other war jobs. The
average Australian doesn’t take long to
pick up the management of a machine —
watch home-taught mechanics pull down
a motor-engine or a farmer’s son re-
pairing a tractor, even to the making of
a new part—and the sooner advantage is
taken of this natural aptitude the better.
It came out during the hearing of
Cameron v. the “D.T.” that Spender had
proposed the Theodore appointment off
his own bat. Last week the Theodore
paper was first in with the report that
Spender was “about to begin a sweeping
reorganisation of Australia’s army
administration,” having completed a
“master plan” in—yes—“six weeks.”
Spender denied the “master plan” but
admitted that information had leaked out
somehow. “I should want to know who
released information from any depart-
ment of which I was the head,” said
Cameron scornfully; and he came at
Percy again when he spotted that worthy’s
absence from the “debate” on the Defence
Co-ordination vote. It was a trying week
for all hands, especially Percy.
Ken Slessor, the official A.I.F. reporter
in Britain, is the witness:
From the first, supplies sent to the Com-
forts Fund in Britain have suffered from the
meanest and most contemptible form of
pilfering. Whole cases and cartons of goods
have been missing when the cargoes have
been sorted out overseas. It is a form
of theft almost impossible to check, yet
one would think that a thief would sooner
filch almost anything than comforts for
Australian fighting men. The majority of
the pilfering seems to occur before or
during shipment.
Criminal law and magisterial practice
are hopelessly inadequate to deal with
this unspeakable crime, whether by way
of prevention or punishment. It is a case
for extension of the national-emergency
regulations, and the penalty should be
what London magistrates are dealing out
to looters —five years’ imprisonment.
One of the surprises of the September
poll was the election of Mr. Max Falstein
for Watson (N.S.W.). In his first speech
at Canberra Mr. Falstein demanded the
appointment of a diplomatic representa-
tive to Russia, describing that country
as “neutral in the present war with
Germany.” Neutral! Continuing, he
ascribed the defeat of France “to one
thing only—the breaking of the hearts
of the workers” by a “reactionary Gov-
ernment which took the place of the
Socialist Government which had con-
cluded a pact with Soviet Russia.” If
Mr. Max Falstein goes on like this a lot
of those who voted for him will feel
sorry that they heaved out the mild Jen-
nings.
Holt, the Minister of Labor and
National Service, is to establish a central
organisation to “carry out comprehen-
sive research into the man-power and
woman-power of the nation with a view
to employing every individual in his
most useful capacity.” If Holt pokes
about a bit he should find a vast bundle
of National Register cards each setting
out that very thing.
Hollway, now Opposition-leader in Vic-
toria, suggests “substitution of a social-
service tax for the unemployed-relief
tax.” The time has gone when politicians
can delude Australians by changing the
names of taxes which remain taxes.
Queensland’s U.A.P. has set up a so-
called electoral college, and five (5) mem-
bers of the electoral college are to choose
all the U.A.P. candidates (30, it may be)
for the Assembly. This is claimed to be
an improvement on the Labor method of
pre-selection by local ballot, subject to
the authority of the almighty Q.C.E. When
the parties have decided on their tickets
the electors will presumably be permitted
to make their choice. Thus does democ-
racy go forward in Queensland.
Without flourish of trumpets or beat
of drums, a system of pensions for poli-
ticians and dependants of politicians has
been instituted at Canberra. On the
latest list there are 12 names, the amount
being just on £2OOO. Nobody likes
to think of old politicians or their fami-
lies being in want, but the precedent set
at Canberra has alarming possibilities.
It was never in the bond that a politi-
cian’s job should carry pension rights.
Politicians should establish their own
superannuation funds by regular deduc-
tions from their salaries.
In future unmarried Tasmanians in
receipt of earned income are to pay a
State tax of £2 ss. on £lO5, £4 2s. on
£l5O and £6 13s. on £2OO. Married per-
sons without children are to pay £2 13s.
on £l5l and £4 ss. on £200; persons
with one dependent child, £2 ss. on £lB3,
£3 7s. on £2OO and £4 14s. on £213, and
persons with two dependent children
£2 2s. on £lB3, the taxes in all
cases rising with income. The changes
were made while Canberra was deciding
that no person receiving less than £2OO
p.a. could afford to pay war tax.
Premising that it Can’t Tell All, Syd-
ney “D.T.” confided to its public that
“the great Australian war-time muni-
tions industry” has expanded in a way
that is “almost miraculous.”
War materials are coming off the
assembly line at a rate which nobody
dreamed possible six months ago. Factories
and workers are turning out at a rapidly-
accelerating rate modern 25-pounder guns,
anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, machine-
guns, rifles, mines, tanks, small-arms
ammunition, shells, ’planes and engines for
’planes. Incredible difficulties have been
overcome. Before this war is much older
we shall be the main source of supply for
India, Singapore and the East.
Excellent; but didn’t the same paper
assure its public in September that “the
defences” had been “neglected,” that “our
soldiers” were “ill-equipped,” that “after
two years’ talking about it we still have
no Bren guns,” and that “annexes” were
“not working” and “factories” were
“wasting time”? And didn’t it put up
a crowd of “outstanding candidates”
(now nearly all sitting out) to set matters
right?
If Australia gets out of this war with
her internal economy stable it will prove
that not even seven Governments can
keep a good country down.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Menzies has a birthday this week —he
will be 46 on December 20. Though
popularly supposed to be older than his
new rival Evatt, he is really eight months
younger.
The careers of Menzies and Evatt have
run remarkably on parallel lines. Born
in the same year (1894) they were
grounded at State schools, and each in
youth was the rising hope of his univer-
sity. Called to the Bar in 1918, they
married in 1920 and took silk in 1929,
when each was a State member. Each
has written books, has a passion for
cricket and football (though not for the
same football code), and is on the trust
of his favorite cricket ground. Now des-
tiny has brought them together in the
same Parliament, and their rivalry is such
that each is calling forth the other’s
utmost powers.
J. S. Weatherston, the Commonwealth’s
principal Parliamentary reporter, has
reached the retiring age, though he looks
10 years younger, and members, appreci-
ative of the excellent work he has done
for 27 years, said many kind things
in taking leave of him —Menzies, Curtin,
Beasley, Fadden, Brennan and Black-
burn in the House, and Hayes, Codings,
McLeay and Johnston in the Senate. He is
succeeded by George Romans, who, long
ago, was one of his daily-paper pals in
Perth. Weatherston began his career on
the long-extinct Melbourne “Standard”
under cheerful old Jimmy Thomson,
who followed him to Westralia. He is
not going to take things easy during his
retirement. He has become president of
the A.N.A. in N. S. Wales, and intends
finishing a book on Burke and Wills, for
which he has collected a great deal of
unpublished material.
Coventry here pictures C. J. Glover,
always known as Jack, an Adelaide archi-
tect who has resigned his seat on the
Adelaide City Council and got into khaki
as a lieutenant in a machine-gun bat-
talion. Glover, who was born in Adel-
aide, a son of the city’s first Lord Mayor,
C. J. GLOVER.
was elected for the McDonnell ward five
years ago. He married Josie Melville,
of the musicomedy stage.
If Victoria’s legislators are Solons
there is one man who ought to be a
Socrates. He is George R. Webb, clerk-
assistant to the Assembly. For 23 years
Webb helped to print the winged words of
the lawgivers in the Government Printing
Office. For 29 more he was on the Par-
liamentary staff, for four years he was
reader in the Assembly, and for 12 years
he has been clerk-assistant. There is a
tradition in the House that he was never
absent from a debate for more than
five minutes. Most men would have been
bored to death by this time, but George
has succeeded in reaching the retiring age
with his faculties unimpaired.
Lord Wakehurst, Governor of New
South Wales, is as all-English as any man
can be, and his appearance bears all the
marks of it. He comes of the direct line
LORD WAKEHURST.
(Modelled by Frith.)
of the ancient and capable Loder family ;
is a descendant of the Wakes —every
schoolboy has heard of Hereward —of
Charles II and Nell Gwyn through a
Duke of St. Albans who was his grand-
father, and of the ancient De Veres, earls
of Oxford, whose main line died out in
the twentieth generation in Stuart times.
Lord Wakehurst, however, is a man who
could have got on very well without
known ancestors. He had early experi-
ence of the world as a soldier —left Eton
to join the 4th Royal Sussex and serve on
Gallipoli and in Mespot and Palestine,
where he was mentioned in dispatches.
He served some time afterwards in the
Foreign Office. He has written on a wide
variety of subjects—industry and the
State, Bolshevism, and the Scottish Isles.
He has been an able and popular Gov-
ernor, and at 45 still has his real career
in front of him.
The old Walker home, which was also
the old Walker legal office in Windsor
(N.S.W.), used to be the pride of what
was regarded as the capital of the
“Ox’bro” district. William Walker, a
perfect model of the country family soli-
citor, who had all the family secrets of
the district in his keeping, became M.L.A.
for Windsor in 1860, and since his long
reign the Macquarie-street Parliament has
had other Walkers from Windsor:
Robert Bruce Walker (1917-32) and
Ronald Bruce Walker (1932-40). Now
the connection is to be broken ; Ronald
Bruce Walker is not going to stand for
re-election.
Dead at 54, Dr. J. Polack, the Mel-
bourne dentist. One of the first
Doctors of Dental Science of Melbourne
Uni., he served some years as president of
the Victorian Dental Board, and was
president of the council of the Dental
Hospital at the end. Trips overseas added
to his experience.
Pretty well all Bendigo turned out for
the funeral of Dr. Florence Charles
Burke-Gaffney. He and his father were
synonyms for the healing art in that city
for more than three generations. The
son served in the 1914-18 war as a lieut.-
colonel, and on his return took up avia-
tion. He was a foundation member of
the Bendigo Aero Club, and was one of
the first physicians in Victoria to fly to
his patients.
S. G. Holland, the new leader of the
Opposition party in M.L., is a mere youth
as Parliamentarians’ ages go. He is but
47, and has been in
Parliament since 1935,
when he succeeded his
father, H. H. Holland,
as member for Christ-
church North. Holland
is a vigorous debater, a
quality lacking in the
National party’s erst-
while leader, Adam
Hamilton. He smote
the Hun from 1915 till
1917 (when he was in-
valided home) with the
N.Z. Field Artillery.
Holland is a native of
Canterbury, was edu-
cated in and served on
many bodies in Christ-
church, and is a keen
sport.
Died suddenly of a
heart attack in a car in
Melbourne, George W.
W. B. Hughes, for 17
years the Y.M.C.A.’s
chief figure in Victoria.
He was born in Adel-
aide in 1878 and
schooled at Sturt-street,
Angas College and the
University. An all-
round sportsman, he
got the position of phy-
sical instructor to the
Adelaide Y.M.C.A. in
1907, then was general
secretary in Dunedin, and went from
Maoriland to the Kaiser’s war. He was
a kindly, jolly man, with an enormous
capacity for work.
“El V.” mourns an ambassador:
Nobody who looked on the first Lord Lothian
without knowing would have summed him up
as one marquess—the 11th of the line —two
earls, a viscount and four barons all rolled into
one; but neither would they have picked him
as one of the ablest political intellects in the
Empire. His English had no noticeable
accent, his clothes looked as if Savile-row
had never existed, his glasses were often half-
way down his nose. Yet his papers in the
journals of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs were a treat to read, for their scholar-
ship and sound sense and for their know-
ledge. Lothian began his public career in
S’Africa early in the century as secretary to
various commissions and there developed an
interest in the Dominions. Thirty years ago
he edited a small and stately journal out
there, graduated to the editorship of the
“Round Table” in its best days, and in 1916
gave up the job to become private secretary to
Lloyd George, who considered him one of the
cleverest young men in England. For a time,
after the war, he was secretary to the Rhodes
Trust, and held one or two Parliamentary
offices, but his health was against him. He
visited Australia at the time of the Munich crisis
in 1938 as president of the Public Relations
Conference and was in Canberra with his
old friend Lionel Curtis while much of the
trouble was on. I asked him what he thought
of Canberra and he answered: “A delightful
sylvan spot. As quiet as Berchtesgaden.”
Shortly afterwards he went to U.S.A. as
Ambassador. He visited England by flying-boat
in October, and returned only to die.
W. Sydney Jones, who as a business
member of the Air Board is to see that
the £37,000,000 allotted to the R.A.A.F.
for the current financial year is spent
wisely, is 'well qualified for the job by
training and heritage. G.m. of Mel-
bourne’s Trustees, Executors and Agency
Co., he has big finance in his blood —
his grandfather, Richard Jones, was
a N. S. Wales Treasurer and sub-
sequently chairman of the Commercial
Banking Co. of Sydney for 20 years.
The new appointee, a square-shouldered
six-footer with a waistband no bigger
than when he went away to the Big Dis-
turbance of 1914-18 —he left Australia as
a gunner and returned with a commis-
sion—finds no difficulty in keeping on
the middle mark at Royal Melbourne
links. When in Sydney he finds sanctuary
at the Australian and Union Clubs.
C. B. Bridges, the N.S.W. M.L.C.
whose election upset some party
manoeuvres, is a Carcoar (N.S.W.) native,
born of theatrical parents in 1881.
His first Sydney job was selling
sandwiches, and the Commonwealth
Inauguration celebrations found him
the boss of luncheon booths at Syd-
ney vShowground. Later he was general
manager of Sargents. Save for a brief
spell with a brother in the show business,
Bridges’s life has been given to catering
and politics. He can tell a good yarn,
and the Chamber will welcome his return.
“Nobby II” goes mythological:
Cold shivers must run down the collective
spine of the German Reichsmarine every time
it thinks of Admiral Ragnar Colvin, Australian
First Naval Member. Ragnarok, in Scandi-
navian mythology, is the Twilight of the Gods,
when a lot of people of a certain type were
obliterated. The admiral has the look of a
Viking, and if he added auburn whiskers to his
equipment to match his thatch he might be mis-
taken for a piece out of mythology himself.
As it is, he has had enough fighting service
to entitle him to drink mead out of a skull.
He comes of a distinguished Indian
civil service family in which he is the lone
sea wolf —three brothers out of four have been
knighted, including himself. He joined
Britannia as a cadet in ’96, and was execu-
tive commander on H.M.S. Revenge at Jut-
land. After the war he served in the Black
Sea as captain of H.M.S. Caradoc during the
1919 operations against the Bolsheviks. Then
he was sent to Tokyo as naval attache;
ADMIRAL COLVIN.
returned to become head of the Tactical School
at Portsmouth, and in 1930 was named Rear-
Admiral and C.-0.-S. to the Atlantic Fleet —
in those days consisting of the Nelson (now
Grand Fleet flagship) and Rodney, four Iron
Duke class battleships, plus Hood, Renown
and Repulse and a flood of smaller fry. Colvin
became Rear-Admiral 2nd Battle Squadron, was
promoted Vice-Admiral in 1934, commanded
the R.N. War College at Greenwich, and in
1937 came to Australia. He is a fine organiser,
a good judge of men, knows his own mind,
and has done a great deal to bring Australian
officers to the front in the service. He has been
one of the most useful and constructive officers
the R.A.N. has ever had.

“Wang”: “There’s a crowd of us in
Ryan’s,” said Dan, “havin’ a few
before we started on the three-
o’clock shift at the freezin’-works.
Young Joe Spudds, who worked in
ole Jobbins’s store next door, blew in.
Joe’s alwus skitin’ ’bout what a great
mem’ry he’s got for dates of all sorts of
happenin’s. He could reel them orf be
the yard. Whether they wus right or not
I can’t say—nobody knew ernough t’
contradick him, an’ he took good care
they wasn’t too recent. Well, after order-
in’ a pot, Joe gets busy on his fav’rite
subject of showin’ his knowledge of dates.
There’s a coupla chaps there who wus
new t’ the place, and after they’d pushed
a few pots into Joe he starts reelin’ off
every date from the Battle o’ Crecy to
when Phar Lap cleaned up at Agua
Caliente. Then ole Jobbins appears at
the door an’ stands there lis’enin’ an’
glarin’ fer a minute or two. Joe’s got
his back to the door, an’ is spoutin’ away,
happily unaware of his scowlin’ boss.
Then ole Jobbins bellers t’ him, ‘Hi,
you! Here’s another date yer can keep
in yer mind t’ remember—the day I
sacked yer.’ He glanced up at the clock.
‘That’s t’day, at three o’clock exact.’
Then he stumped away.”

“P.M.”: Always thought the ingenious
mind of Homo sapiens was responsible
for the “medicinal value” excuse for im-
bibing a bit of snake-juice unmolested by
the better-half. It seems, however, that
some of our four-footed friends hit upon
the same bright notion. Found the fol-
lowing in an article on the care of
animals during sea voyages: “Elephants
do not like the sea, but are amenable to
treatment. A bucketful of hot water
containing three and a half pints of
whisky and seven ounces of quinine
should be occasionally administered.”

“Kingsman”: “That pointer o’ mine,
Sandy,” old Mac averred, “is so good
at indicatin’ the presence uv game I c’d
go out an’ shoot quail blindfold if I
wanted. With Sandy pointin’ f’r me,
there ain’t no need f’r me t’ keep a look-
out at all; all I does is watch Sandy’s
tail. But one day I reckons ’e lets me
down bad, after startin’ orf good, too.
There’s plenty uv birds about, an’ I’m
bringin’ ’em down right an’ left. Then
alluva sudden Sandy goes t’ pieces. A
quail buzzes up right in front uv me.
I’m so surprised I lets it git away, an’
when I looks at Sandy ’e’s sittin’ down
scratchin’ ’imself. Five minits later an-
other bird ’ops up, an’ all Sandy does
is yawn. Cripes, I thinks, wotinell’s gorn
wrong with the dorg? An’ I curses ’im
like mad. Well, ’e jist sits there, takin’
it all in, an’ when I’m finished ’e comes
over an’ looks ’ard at me bag. I’m
Mowed if I c’n understand it till Sandy
starts tappin’ his paw on the ground.
An’ then I sees wot ’e means. I tips
the birds out an’ counts ’em. Yair,
there s jist thirty there —me legal tally
f’r a day!”

Julia C.”: For a homing instinct
equal to that of any horse, dog or
pigeon 1 nominate two green frogs which
made their home in an open canvas
waterbag near Maxwellton (N.Q.). Moved
to a near-by waterhole, they returned.
Then to a swamp five miles away, and
again they returned. Finally, taken to
a point 20-odd miles out on the run in
the coat pocket of a horseman, they were
back again in a couple of weeks. There
were many dry stages on the return trip,
too.

“B. A. Ker”: The storekeeper used to
have a soft spot for a battler—which
was the reason why he allowed the Pratt
family to “chain up a dog” to the tune
of twenty-odd quid. Then one morning
the news travelled round that the Pratts
had done a moonlight flit from the
market-garden they’d been leasing—
incidentally leaving the owner to pay the
accumulated water-rates. Disillusioned,
the storekeeper wrote off the debt as
lost money. Nearly twelve months later
“Hey, Joe, drop one of them depth-charges and let Bill know it's
tucker-time.”
a car stopped outside the shop and a
prosperous-looking Pratt senior alighted,
flourishing a cheque for fifty pounds.
“The first cheque from my tomato crop,”
he explained; “take half of your bill,
plus a quid interest. I’ll pay old Smith for
the water-rates I let him in for with the
balance. Just on my way there now.”
With his faith in human nature restored,
the creditor complied. “I’ll square up the
other half before the end of the month,”
declared Pratt as he climbed back into
the car. Unfortunately this isn’t fiction,
hence the unhappy ending: the debtor
didn’t come back—but the cheque did!
That’s why the storekeeper used to have
a soft spot for a battler!

“D.Mc.”: “I’m headin’ in from a
drovin’ trip back o’ the Diamantina,” said
Joe Staggers, “when I pulled in to a
shack in one of the loneliest places y’
could pick. An old bloke comes rushin’
out when ’e ’eard me an’ started doin’
a war-dance. ‘Wot the ’ell do you want?’
’e snorted. ‘You’re the second coot that’s
called ’ere this year. D’you think I’m
a blasted talkin’ machine? A bloke can’t
live private in this flamin’ country any
longer. On’y last month some cove took
up a block over behind the next range—
practercally got ’is ’ead stuck in a man’s
back door. There won’t be room t’
swing a blasted cat round ’ere soon. Now
they reckon they’re goin’ t’ bring the
railway to within a ’undred miles o’ this
place. You take my word fer it, we’ll
be havin’ some terrible eperdemics break
out wot with all this overcrowdin’. Now
get goin’, son, before you start spreadin’
yer wogs around ’ere!’ An’ ’e grabs an
old muzzle-loader! When I left him —
which was pretty quick—’e’s sprayin’ out-
side the shack with disinfectant!”

“Clinton Cape”: Mandurah (W.A-),
plumes itself on being the scene of the
most curious accidental death recorded in
Australian history. In its widespread
estuary breed all kinds of fish, not the
least plentiful being the giant kingfish
and the bait for its capture, the trumpeter.
But the trumpeter must be put on the
hook alive. Back in the days when
hostile blacks necessitated a military
guard, a private of the 21st Regiment sat
himself down for a spot of fishing.
Having caught a trumpeter he pulled in
his kingfish line for a. fresh bait. Sud-
denly the trumpeter gave a convulsive
jump—and went down his throat, stick-
ing halfway so that it could neither be
pushed right down nor pulled out. So
inside a couple of minutes, while his pals
vainly tried to render relief, he choked.
Yes, he was holding the trumpeter by
the head between his teeth so as to have
both hands free, as you and I have done
a dozen times ourselves—that’s if you are
a deep-sea angler!
* * *
“Old-timer”: One Christmas me and
old Sam hits Euchapivy, a one-pub, one-
store city hidin’ in the lignum. It don’t
look like supportin’ a couple of indigent
padfloggers like me an’ Sam. Still an’
all, you never know how a dish’ll pan
out till y’ pan it, an’ we gives the place
a go. Soon’9 the storekeeper lamps Sam
he grabs him, sayin’ how he wants a
Santa t’ hand out toys to the infancy of
the district, and Sam with his white whis-
kers is just the bloke. Sam says, “How
about me offsider?” “Offsider?” says the
storekeeper, lookin’ at me. “Yair,” says
Sam; “y’ oughter use him. He’s got
brains, he has.” The storekeeper looks
doubtful about it, but gives in. So me
an’ Sam gets busy, the idea bein’ for
him to arrive in his red cloak out of the
blue, kiddin’ the kids he’s just dropped
down from the sky. There’s an old well
behind the store, an’ we rigs a tent over
this. Then we builds a stage down in
the well an’ fixes up a pulley an’ weight
an’ fills the old tent with shavings an’
so forth. Well, Christmas Eve comes,
an’ all the lignum larrikins hits the place
with their kids. Just when it’s dark we
set fire to the tent —old Sam in his rigout
bein’ down the well under it —an’ when
she’s well ablaze I tips the weight an’
watches t’ see old Sam come shootin’
through the flames. But the fire burns
the rope through, an’ the stage falls to
the bottom of the well into about two
feet o’ water an’ muck, an’ there’s Sam
with the burnin’ tent failin’ down in bits
on top o’ him. He’s screamin’ and yell-
in' like mad, an’ some goat rushes up
a 200-gallon shiptank on'a cart an’ tips
the lot down the well. After that we fish
Sam out. The kids have a great time,
an’ everybody reckons Sam’s a hard-
doer. We patches up his burns, an’ the
storekeeper gives us some tucker an’ a
few bob, and says t’ Sam, “Y’ want t’
stick to that offsider of yours ; he’s got
brains, he has!” Sam don’t say any-
thing, only looks at me. So I pick up
me swag an’ pad off on me own. It’s
crook the way some blokes go on.

“Mat’s Mate”: To the initiated of the
back country a big, young, quiet bloke
with a straight eye and a jutting chin
isn’t the sort to pick on if you want to
show your fistic or bluffing ability, so
Joe the Yank was regarded with some
sympathy when he began picking on big
Mat. “Learin’ up round here in y’r
tailor-made clobber,” he sneered ; “who
d’ y’ reckon you are?” Mat leaned easily
against the bar and surveyed the Yank
for a moment; then he turned to the
publican and said, “You got any Wor-
cester sauce?” The publican got him
a bottle. Mat put it on the counter in
front, of the Yank. “Drink that,” he said.
“It’ll sober you up. I don’t want t’ hit
y’ while y’re drunk, ’cos I always like a
bloke t’ remember what it feels like when
I hit him. You drink that, Joe, an’ then
I’ll oblige y’ if y’re lookin’ f’r stoush.”
Joe backed away. “Can’t y’ take a joke?”
he stammered. Mat grinned. “I’m takin’
one now,” he said, and pushed the sauce
towards Joe. “Aw, have a drink,” said
Joe, and the disappointed crowd fell
vway.
“Yerta”: Can’t see
eye to eye with
“Joe Flint” on two
points (B. 16/10/’4O).
For one thing, the
abos. weren’t in-
clined to extermi-
nate species, even
such as the wombat
that were easy to
catch. One function
of the tote m i c
system, with its
taboos, was obvi-
ously to help pre-
serve species. Also,
most, if not all,
tribes seem to have
had sanctuaries in
which no game
could be hunted.
These provided an
inexhaustible reser-
voir for breeding-up.
For another thing,
“J.F.” seems to have
got his ideas mixed
when he says that
the aborigines only recently overran
the s.-w. corner of the continent.
The theory that has confused him is the
one which presupposes two waves of
aborigines coming to this continent. The
first, the Tasmanoids, covered both the
continent and Tasmania. The second,
in search of Lebensraum, conquered the
whole of the mainland, absorbing those
Tasmanoids they did not kill. This theory
holds that the s.-w. corner was the last
portion tof Australia to be conquered and
colonised by the invaders.
* * * *
“Mick the Miler”: Most bushmen treat
the river gum with great respect because
of its habit of shedding apparently sound
limbs without the slightest warning. I
am now convinced that the margin be-
tween soundness and breaking-point must
be very slight. Was helping a farmer to
move his machinery to a new farm
recently, and, unable to find a loading-
bank, we had to use a block-and-tackle.
We anchored the pulleys on to the
Min. limb of a sound-looking gum,
hoisted a fourteen-disc Sundercut and
several lighter implements on to the
truck, and drove back to the shade of
the machine-shed, where smoke-oh was
waiting for us. While we were seated
there a whirlwind started on the bank of
the creek and came towards us, sucking
up leaves and roly-polies and spinning
them up 100 ft. in the air ; it came straight
at the gum, and the leaves had hardly
commenced to flutter when the limb with
the pulleys attached crashed to the
ground across the spot where the truck
had been standing.
* * * *
“Pop”: Admire the energy with which
Jolliffe’s Ma (B. 27/11/’4O) is shearing
the sheep, but that harassed woman seems
to be unaware that the long blow is not
employed with hand shears—that is a
copyright stroke exclusive to the machine
shearer. The hand shearer opens up on
the left side diagonally from the flank
to the wither, going just over the spine.
Going down the whipping side he sits
the sheep on its rump, cuts diagonally
from the wither to the flank. Further,
the hand shearer doesn’t put his knee
in the sheep’s crutch.
THE GHOST OF BEN HALL.
In a bend where the Lachlan flows peace-
fully on,
It stands in a clump of belars —
A tumbledown relic of years that are gone—
And it dreams ’neath the light of the stars;
It is tenanted now by the owls and the bats,
And they fly in and out through the door,
But long-bearded bushmen in cabbage-tree hats
Ride up to the shanty no more.
What tales it could tell if its walls had a tongue
Of its lurid and reprobate past,
Of the fights that were fought and the sonjs
that were sung
When the gin and the whisky flowed fast!
A hard-drinking lot were those riders of old,
And they gathered from near and from far;
But most of the bushmen lie under the mould
Who drank in that tumbledown bar.
Ben Hall often sampled its whisky and gin
When he came to the bend with his gang,
And the walls and the rafters rang loud to
the din
Of the boisterous songs that they sang.
Ben Hall was a troublesome person at times,
And 1 doubt if he paid for his grog,
But he paid in full measure at last for his
crimes
When the Law shot him down like a dog.
But time is a tyrant and time travels fast,
And the old shanty stands in the shade
And mourns for the men of the picturesque past
And the jokes and the antics they played.
The curlews lament from the rushes and reeds
When the shadows of evening descend,
But long-bearded bushmen on half-broker
steeds
Come riding no more to “the bend.”
Yet the old hands declare that on cold winter
nights
When the heavens are misty and blurred,
The shanty is filled with mysterious lights
And laughter and singing are heard!
And they say you can see, when the door
swings ajar,
A figure black-bearded and tall,
Revolver in hand, by the tumbledown bar,
And they swear it’s the ghost of Ben Hall.
VICTORIA.
EDWARD HARRINGTON.


“K.Mc.”: The boss noticed that the
sawny farmhand got to work a bit late
one morning. A couple of times he
worked his way up close to the boss, then
sidled off again. By the way his lips
moved without shaping any sound it was
obvious he had something to say and
was practising various phrases to himself
before selecting the one best designed to
unload his burden. A quiet break at
lunchtime gave him his chance. “Gee!”
he said, “the ole man ’ad ’ard luck lars’
night.” “What,” said the boss; “miss
his favorite radio session or something?”
“Naa,” drawled the sleepy one. “’E
dii-eed.”
H* H*
“Gaskin”: Unconcerned about what
Prof. Moll says, I am in a position to
tell “J. Umbuck” (B. 13/11/ ’4O) that all
the regurgitation doesn’t save Jim Crow.
Here on Newholme, Charleville (C.Q.),
where we are scrub-cutting, our average
is two crows a day poisoned with S.A.P.
Only this morning I saw one give a
feeble croak and drop stone-dead from
a rung gidya. Once the poison starts
to “bite” it’s the end of the black devil.
* # * *
“Naturala”: The little mud turtle (B.
20/11/ ’4O) was one of the abo.’s staples
in the days when he owned the western
half of this continent. Like her larger
cousins of the sea, the freshwater turtle
seeks the land for the purpose of deposit-
ing eggs. Small spheres that might pass
for ping-pong balls, these were much
sought after by Mrs. Binghi. Around
the edges of the many south Westralian
swamps was the place, in among the
acreages of pigweed and sedge grass. For
the lady mud turtle, stupid as the species
may be in other respects, was not beyond
practising a measure of camouflage, con-
stant spoliation having taught her the
necessity for concealment. But Mrs.
Binghi would uncover the nest all the
same, for she in turn had the cunning
to track the tiny shellback from where
her prints showed in the mud at the
water edge. But, unlike the white man
who kills all wild animals and takes all
the eggs without thought of the year after
next, Mrs. Binghi never stripped the
turtle’s nest quite bare. Stone Age wis-
dom informed her that such a course
“Well, if a mans got t ’ be vaccinated, do it where it Wont show.”
would have meant the ultimate extinc-
tion of the little goose that laid the
.better-than-golden eggs.
* * * *
“O. W. Waireki”: We were discussing
Dad’s new hand. “What are his dogs
like?” I asked. Dad frowned. “He’s only
got two,” he said. “One’s a smash-and-
grab and the other’s a skyliner.”
* * * *
“Frith-Froth”: I know I’m open to
be regarded as a crank, but I’ve never
yet agreed that anybody who sees a snake
should kill it. When the thing is near
a house or camp or settlement of any
kind, or in a school-ground or public
park, common safety demands its death,
but out on the plains or in the bush,
where men only occasionally go, the
snake has a right to its life. It doesn’t
wilfully or wantonly attack anybody,
doesn’t destroy lambs or young calves
like dingoes and crows, and is valuable
for the mice and rats it gets rid of.
Yet ordinarily sane bushmen who can’t
be scared by mad bulls or wild dogs will
go to any lengths to get a snake.
* * V
“Acombe”: A burned-out coil had
forced us to camp out. Tucker over, I
was on my second pipe; old Peter sat
dozing in the well of the utility, his legs
dangling behind, his back propped
against a netted crate which housed part
of our load. The old fellow’s bald pate
drooped low, seeming in the dim firelight
to merge into his chest, giving him an
uncanny, truncated look. Into our quiet
broke the sounds of a distant bell and of
a singer approaching, identifiable pres-
ently as “Silent” Knight, beefing ribald
songs as he rode over to his mailbox
close by. He was wearing a Condamine
bell on his horse’s neck, according to his
strange habit. Seeing our fire, “Silent”
stopped singing and turned towards the
camp, apparently bent on a yarn.
Resignedly I threw the dying fire together.
In a few seconds the dry logs flared,
sending weird shadows dancing about the
camp and half-lighting Peter and the cage
behind him. Our visitor’s mouth, just
opening to call “Good night,” released
instead a bloodcurdling squawk of
fear. Wheeling his horse “on a
plate,” “Silent” bolted wildly back into
the sandalwood, shouting unintelligible
gibberish as the big bell boomed madly.
Awakened by the din, Peter straightened
up, his astonished visage thereby totally
eclipsing the kindly face of the Saanen
goat I was taking back to the kids.
Nanny had been sniffing at the back of
the old man’s bent neck when “Silent”
rode up and jumped to, wild conclusions.
* * * *
“Mei”: “Immune to strychnine those
dogs are,” marvelled Dad, after
Geraghty’s greyhounds had taken the
second lot of baits and were still gay
enough to kill two or three of Dad’s
wethers in the course of the night. Dave
agreed that it was wonderful, and went
on reading the skin-market reports. If
they were lucky on Sunday’s run, those
greyhounds ought to get ten ’roos at
least, and half of the catch would be his,
Ted Geraghty had said, if he could stop
Dad from poisoning the dogs. Well, as
long as Dad pinned his faith to the cochi-
neal-tinted Epsom salts Dave had put in
the strychnine bottle the dogs would be
safe, and he went on figuring how long
it would be before he’d make enough
from his share of the skins to buy a rifle.

“Merrangbaur”: “Them big feet of
Shandy’s,” began Bert the barman,
“comes in pretty ’andy one Sund’y. Late
in the afternoon the Bay starts to cut
up rough, but we don’t worry about that
until we starts f’r ’ome an’ the engine
conks out. We ’as a look, but there’s
plenty of juice, so we ’as to take down
the flamin’ engine. We’re ’ard at it an’
up to our ears in grease when Shandv
“The stokers are complaining that the cutlets are underdone.”
stands up to give ’is back a rest. ’E gapes
around, then lets out a yell. I ’as a screw
an’, ’struth! we’re nearly down to the
Rip! We starts lookin’ for the oars, but
they ain’t there. Somebody’s pinched
’em or somethin’. I reckons the only
thing to do is to dice the boat an’ swim f’r
it, but Shandy won’t ’ave it on at all.
It’s ’is boat, y’ see. While we’re arguin’
we’re gettin’ nearer the Rip an’ the boat’s
driftin’ faster. Then Shandy gets an
idea. ’E ’auls orf ’is boots, flops belly-
down on the stern an’ shoves ’is feet in
the water. Then ’e starts to push. For
a long time it’s touch an’ go, with Shandy
workin’ like a treadmill; then ’e puts on
an extra spurt, an’ the launch starts creep-
in’ f’r ’ome.” Bert swallowed a quick one
while the boss wasn’t looking. “Yair ;
we gets back orl right, round about dawn.
But we ’as to carry Shandy ’ome ’cause
’e can’t walk. Y’see, ’is feet ’ad been
worked so ’ard that the skin ’ad wore
orf!”

“0.W.W.”: Rewi and Henare, both
rotund, were pasting into slimly-built
Honi outside the town’s movie hall when
a policeman arrived and ended the dis-
turbance. “What are two big fellows like
you belting him for?” he demanded “Te
dirty cow take off our bellies again,”
Rewi said angrily. “But surely there’s
no need for two grown men to carry on
like that just because someone pokes fun
at your pukus,” said the cop severely. “Not
our pukus,” said Rewi. “He go an’ take
off te bellies of our woolly sheep in his
Stranger mob, like last year, an’ belly
wool tenpence te pound now, te cunning
sneak-thiever!”
* * * *
“Atrax”: Those stupid, cantankerous
and much overrated insects bees certainly
do choose some queer places for estab-
lishing their gigolo-infested matriarchies.
At Ayr (N.Q.) a petrol bowser was
regarded as providing all mod. cons., and
in spite of fumes was occupied through
the lever slots. The apparatus had to be
dismantled and the
invaders driven off
with flysprays be-
fore they were
finally discouraged.
A Tweed River
fisherman left his
motor-boat at the
moorings for a
fortnight while he
was in hospital.
When he opened
the cabin door a
swarm of the iras-
cible old maids
attacked him and
chased him over-
board they had
selected the engine
as a nest site and
had to be fumigated
out with sulphur.
Some years ago the
organ in a Thurs-
day Island church
went on strike after
a prel i m i nary
period of extremely
unecclesiastical up-
roars —bees had gummed up the works.
Some day they will get into the Con-
stitution of the Commonwealth and we'll
all be stung worse than ever.
MY FEET IN DREAMS HAVE
WANDERED.
Embowered by dark ti-trees a quiet hollow lies
Wherein 1 crouch awaiting the clearing of the
skies; , .
And fall betimes to musing on days that
vanished when
To war and chase in Thomond went other care-
less men.
The hills and meads of Thomond mine eyes
have ne’er beheld;
But well I know its legends, its haunting tales
of eld
From youthful years remembered; and oft by
shrine and well
My feet in dreams have wandered where elves
and fairies dwell.
Again, in dozing daydream, I follow in the
light
Of clear, familiar morning a mewed hawk’s
poising flight,
Ere Cormac ruled o’er Erin or Oisin wrote,
or in
The golden scrolls of Munster were scribed
the songs of Finn.
Grey clouds on Howe have fallen. Through
mists of reverie
The eyes of long-dead women smile softly now
to me:
All these have moaned in childbirth that there
might be today
Another song to fashion beneath the ti-trees
grey!
Through fifty generations these mothers of a
clan —
A chain with links unbroken, from Sadhaba to
Ann—
Have tasted joy and sorrow, and each in turn
borne on
A lamp that shone in Thomond before the days
of Conn.
O Mothers of Hy-Grada! Upon your breasts
have lain
The heads of what fair daughters, what sons
in battle slain!
The sianan is silent; no wedding feast, no
birth
Shall bring your feet rejoicing from couches
of dull earth.
To me, a music-maker, amort, and dreaming
here,
Ye seem of all Earth’s women most intimate
and dear;
Your lullabies the winds are, and from the
shores today
I catch in echo music proud tunes the harpers
play.
A requiem the sea keens for women of my
clan
Who pass in dim procession from Sadhaba to
Ann.
To each I whisper “Mother” ... I dream that
one by one
Each wanly-smiling shadow, responsive, answers
“Son”. . .
The clouds from Howe are drifting, soft-
footed now they pass,
To leave me vainly asking the silent leaves
and grass:
Whence came my poignant vision, unbidden
and unsought?
Has, in this lonely covert, a Druid’s spell been
wrought?

Considering all the lions in the path,
the surprising feature is that the drop
(£30,035) in profits wasn’t greater. The
price of newsprint rocketed in an alarm-
ing fashion, and continues to rise, while
war and the censorship bumped up the
cost of newsgathering. Competition,
especially from broadcasting, forced the
co. to spend a lot of money in gingering
up its cable service. Still, the frequent
broadcasting of news, both from local
and overseas stations, has kept expansion
of newspaper sales within narrow limits.
Then, to help the Government conserve
dollar funds, came a cut of up to 35 p.c.
in the size of newspapers from the begin-
ning of July last, and for the most part the
big dailies lost more in advertising revenue
than was directly saved in costs. Also,
the co. has put a lot of money into the
new mill for the manufacture of news-
print at Boyer, on the Derwent (Tas.),
from which no return has yet been
received. To provide for such part of
this investment as was not met from
current funds, 275,000 £1 6 p.c. prefs.
were offered and heavily oversubscribed
last term. The mill at Boyer is expected
to be begin commercial production in
February next. Another chip out of
earnings is the difference between civil
and military pay of some 200 employees
who have enlisted, which is costing the
co. about £650 per week.
The co.’s interests embrace a string of
daily and other publications, etc., in Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Brisbane, and it
has substantial interests in commercial
broadcasting stations as well. Its own
publications in Melbourne number about
10, chief of which are the “Herald,” for
long the backbone of the business, and
the “Sun,” a morning daily. Circulation
of the “Herald” is reported satisfactory,
while that of the “Sun” continues to
exceed sales of Melbourne’s other two
morning dailies combined. Outside in-
terests include control of Advertiser
Newspapers, Ltd., and News, Ltd., both
in Adelaide, and of Queensland News-
papers, Ltd., which amalgamated the
“Courier” and “Mail” cos. in Brisbane.
After setting aside £41,748 (down
£10,975) for the taxgatherer and allow-
ing £44,476 (down £2579) for deprecia-
tion, the declared net result was £27,456
lighter at £206,473, or enough to pay
the pref. divs. and show 17.9 p.c. on the
£1,100,000 of ord. capital. The allow-
ance for depreciation, however, has long
been in excess of normal require-
ments for the purpose, and is included
with profits in the table and then shown
as written off. On this basis there was
enough profit to pay the pref. divs. and
show 21.9 p.c. on ord. capital, compared
with 24.8, 26.1, 22.8, 19.8, 18.1, 16.2 and
15.8 p.c. back to 1933. The div. was
kept at 14 p.c.
As for the current term, increased
taxation and still higher costs can be
expected to bite further into earnings,
and, since the Government will mop up
most of the surplus cash available, busi-
ness generally promises to become more
sticky. The co., however, is very well
equipped to earn satisfactory profits, the
lowest rate of div. paid during the slump
being 9 p.c.
There is nothing to worry about in
the finances:

Outstanding features last term were the
additions of £240,358 to shareholdings
and of £88,426 to stocks. To meet the
outlay, together with a reduction of
£74,656 in outside liabilities, debtors’
balances were reduced by £43,543, cash
by £33,555 and the new pref. money
already referred to was gathered. The
year’s growth in the more or less liquid
surplus was £326,342.
The market prices the pound ords. at
545. as against 58s. a year ago. The
return at 545. is 5.2 p.c. on a 14 p.c.
div. basis, or 4.4 p.c. should the distri-
bution drop to 12 p.c. At 295. and
255. 6d. the 6 } p.c. and 6 p.c. prefs.
yield 4.5 p.c. and 4.7 p.c. respectively.
The net tangible backing for the prefs.

respectively, and for the ords. 255. 4d.

Continued and profitable expansion of
the business is the outstanding feature
of the latest accounts. The co. is the
centre of a large group of self-supporting,
complementary industrial activities in
Australia, Maoriland and S’Africa which
manufacture felt piece-goods, carpets,
footwear and wool tops and yarns, etc.
From the end of 1936 —just after the
public became interested. —to June 30
last capital advanced from £119,930 to
£869,247. Of the increase of £749,317
the public put up £488,927, bonus scrip
accounted for £135,500, and the balance
was issued mainly in payment for sub-
sidiary interests, which accounts for the
growth of £37,333 in the figure last
term.
Profitable employment v/as soon found
for the £200,000 of 6 p.c. pref. money
got in during the ’39 term, and for a lot
more besides. Consider these consolidated
balance-sheet figures of the parent and
its subsidiaries:

To carry an extra £580,276 of stocks,
add £140,162 to debtors’ balances,
£118,485 to plant and £31,502 to free-
hold, the board increased the overdraft
by £579,896 and the amount coming to
sundry creditors, etc. (the etcetera is an
unspecified provision for taxation), by
£'.’'.,7£=-.. Although the more or less
liquid surplus (£342,496, including
stocks) increased £71,648, there was
approx. 225. of outside money at risk in
the business for every pound of tan-
gibles belonging to shareholders when
the books closed. To ease the position
those on the register have been offered
314,624 new £1 ords., one for two, at
par.
Although war interrupted the manage-
ment’s plans for foreign expansion, turn-
over of the group as a whole shot up
32 p.c. during the 12 months covered by
the latest accounts. This was mainly on
account of increased commercial demand
and partly in respect of defence require-
ments. The wool-scouring and carbonis-
ing offshoots were fully employed, partly
in treating Australian wool for the
British Government, while defence con-
tracts and demand, also for military pur-
poses, from India and Canada kept the
top-making subsidiary working to capa-
city. Another important section of the
group is the slipper businesses—mainly
well-established concerns welded into the
organisation which have a very firm
grip on the Australasian and S’African
markets. In Maoriland, where a new
factory has just been completed, the co.’s
principal products, excepting carpets, are
excluded from the list of allowable im-
ports ; and carpets can only be brought
in from the U.K. up to 50 fffc. of 1938
imports therefrom. The S’African off-
shoot enjoys an expanding market, too,
while exchange is in the nature of a
windfall for the parent.
After allowing £79,825 for taxation and
£38,798 for depreciation, declared net
earnings of the group were £65,969 better
at £160,153. That leaves out of the
reckoning £24,068 dropped from some-
where into reserves, an addition of
£18,129 to goodwill (not treated as an
asset herein) and £2157 written off estab-
lishment account of one of the pups. The
£160,153 was enough to pay the prefs.
their 6 p.c. and show an attractive 23.8
p.c. on average ord. capital, as against
15.2 p.c. for each of the two preceding
terms. The div. was kept at 10 p.c., and
looks like remaining there, for the
present term, at any rate, despite stinging
increases in war-time taxation and the
continued climb of costs.
During 1940 the price of the pound
ords. has fluctuated between 425. 6d. and
30s. in the market. Last week-end the
figure was 375. 6d., at which the return
is 5.3 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div. basis. At
255. and 245. 6d. the first and second
6 p.c. prefs. return 4.8 p.c. and 4.9 p.c.
respectively. The net tangible cover is

The drygoods trade is a difficult one at
any time. That Clifford Love has been
able to do well where so many others
have tripped up speaks volumes for the
shrewdness of the control, the efficiency
of its plant and the reputation for
quality its products have established.
Nothing less than 10 p.c. has gone out
since the public came in in 1922 and
Brown and Poison’s was absorbed, while
12i p.c. was paid in the half-dozen years
to the time the table commences. The
scrip, as a result, has always commanded
a tidy premium in the market, so that new
share-issues from time to time to finance
expanding turnover have constituted some
nice pickings. A div. equalisation re-
serve of £27,500 was brought to light in
1939, partly from visible contingency pro-
visions, and there are other reasons for
supposing that profits are written without
any pangs of doubt in the board-room.
All of which looks very encouraging
for the difficult days ahead. The mar-
ket adopts a similar view, offering 50s.
for the pound shares as against 465. 9d.
a year ago, the return at the higher figure
running to 4 p.c. Including 12s. 7d. a
share in the reserve for depreciation, con-
tingencies, etc. (now £139,615, or 87 p.c.
of plant cost), the net tangible backing
is 425. 2d.
Among the proprietary lines, oatmeal,
cornflour, starch, rice, etc., are solid old
standbys. Tea and some Asiatic goods are
rather slippery propositions at the
moment, but whatever effects these, price
control and lifts in uncontrollable outgo
have had on the business have been more
than offset by heftier turnover on the
whole, combined with increased efficiency,
and last year’s profit was declared £749
higher at £27,912. That was after allow-
ing £16,500 (up £4000) for tax com-
mitments and adding £15,668 to the
reserve for other contingencies and

As a consumer of current the public, as
well as shareholders, is interested in this
big undertaking, which supplies Adelaide
and the whole s.-e. portion of the State
with electricity. Its charges to the public
are governed chiefly by the rate of in-
terest and divs. paid on share and deben-
ture capital, allowances for depreciation,
etc., and by the cost of generation and
distribution.
The share and debenture capital is

Last term an extra £250,000 of 5 p.c.
pref. money was gathered. The co.’s total
funds (capital, debentures and reserves
combined) are now costing on the
average a moderate p.c. as against
6 p.c. half a dozen years ago.
No specific allowance is made each
year for depreciation; hence the un-
expired book value of plant scrapped is
written off from reserves. The £102,572
written off last term suggests mainten-
ance of modern equipment, and that
means much so far as costs are con-
cerned.
An extra 2970 consumers were con-
nected to the co.’s mains in the last term:

Recent rapid increase in power consump-
tion reflects the board’s policy of hiring
cookers, heaters, etc., and the growth of
industrial activity, which still continues
in S. Aus., where there are no natural
deposits of coal.

The growth of £61,530 in exes, was due
to expansion of the business and the lift
in wage and material and tax costs.
After deducting debenture interest and
allowing for minor reserve adjustments,
enough remained to pay the pref. divs.,
hand the ords. 10 p.c., write £102,572 off
plant, etc., rub out the cost (£2597) of
the new capital and leave £38,936 for
reserves.
There is nothing to worry about in the
financial position. During the year
£259,100 was spent on the undertaking,
making its writtemdown book value
£6,336,039. Debtors figure at £151,563,
stock £230,553 and cash, etc. £190,418.
The amount coming to trade creditors
was £178,568.
Over the twelvemonth the market for
the scrip has strengthened by over 3s.

It’s been a vigorous development since

Over the five years to the close of
accounts in 1936 the favorable movement
in the net earnings was £72,860. Assisted
by £193,070 of new capital, sales have
continued to move in the right direction,
but the growth in taxation and wage
bills, along with new-store establishment
and rebuilding exes., has checked much
benefit to profits.
The co. trades in clothing, drapery and
furniture in all States but Queensland,
mainly on a credit basis, and has
a substantial mail-order connection.
Self-contained branch headquarters in
Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Launceston,
Hobart and Newcastle feed 37 smaller

spread of the whole 43 being Victoria 10,
Westralia 14, N.S.W. eight, Tasmania
six and South Aus. five.
Seasonal conditions affected country
spending last term, but money flowed
freely in the cities, and, after providing
£4865 more at £19,728 for taxation and
writing £7493 off fixed assets, net earnings
were shown £517 better at £61,084. That
disregards a loss of £ll5O on sale of a
Perth furniture factory. The £61,084
was sufficient to hand both lots of prefs.

average ord. capital, compared with 21.7,
41.8, 53 and 49.6 p.c. on the smaller

Ord. div. was cut to 124 p.c., but it took
£3031 more than 15 p.c. did in 1939, and
will call for a further £4545 if maintained
for the current term.
Consolidation is following expansion.
The only store opened last term was at
Lismore (N.S.W.). Most of the £80,819
of capital gathered was used to lighten
the debt by £55,363 and so reduce the

to its Policyholders either personally or to
their dependents during 1939.
The payment of these large sums indicates
beyond all doubt the value of a Colonial

decrease in value.
There is a Colonial Mutual Life Policy

diate yield is 8.6 p.c. The 7 p.c. first and

Hal Colebatch has been to Canberra to
ask the Federal Government to assist
Great Boulder Prop, and other West-
ralian goldmining cos. registered in Lon-
don and operating at Kalgoorlie to obtain
relief from Britain’s 100 p.c. excess-profits
tax. Colebatch has the backing of the
State Government. Premier Willcock
says the position is serious from the West-
ralian standpoint, because cos. that could
employ hundreds of additional men re-
muneratively cannot be expected to do so
in view of existing circumstances.
* * * *
From London:
Correspondence respecting Gt. Boulder’s
affairs has not yet reached the “must-cease”
stage in the financial press. Most arguments
put forward in “letters to the editor” in sup-
port of the co.’s attempt to change its domi-
cile from here to Perth are merely a repetition
of those used by chairman Claude de Ber-
nales—namely, that, in the exceptional case
of Gt. Boulder, the British excess-profits tax
is a crushing injustice, and that the bulk of
the shareholders are in Australia and want the
change. Until recently about 70 per cent, of
Gt. Boulder shares were on the London register,
but it is understood that holdings of the De
Bernales family cos. have been transferred to
Adelaide; thus making it possible to say that
a majority of the shares are held in Australia.
* * * *
Lady Shenton and First Hit, two West-
ralian goldmining cos. operating at Men-
zies, were in the news the other day.
The Shenton’s report showed receipts for
the year to June 30 at £635 and expendi-
ture at £1720, leaving a debit of £lOB5.
Plant on the abandoned Shenton lease
sold before June 30 realised £4503, and
machinery, buildings and salvaged ma-
terials sold since that date brought £l2OO.
About £4OOO in cash and bank deposits
was in hand on June 30. J. O. McArdell,
a former manager, and T. J. Watt, the
present manager, both agree that the co.’s
new Maranoa lease promises a consider-
able tonnage of ore. McArdell puts the
grade at from sdwt. to 6dwt., and Watt
at from 6dwt. to 7dwt. Watt adds that
this grade is too low to send away for
treatment, but would be profitable if
milled and cyanided on the mine.
Directors say that funds in hand should
look after a comprehensive develop-
mental programme ; if results are satis-
factory the Government will be button-
holed for a loan under the Common-
wealth Goldminine Encouragement Act.
First Hit’s chairman, J. L. Paton, said
at the annual roll-up that the board’s bold
policy of development had been justified.
The west shoot had been exposed and
opened up, while the Queensland Menzies
ore-body had been followed down to the
740 ft. level, where what might be an
additional shoot or pipe to the gold-
carrier had been discovered. With the
outlay of £7OOO a year on development
—a lot of money for a co. of the size
of First Hit to spend—conservative
financing was essential in case fresh
shoots were not found. The board had
therefore considered it advisable to build
up the co.’s resources to the present satis-
factory level. Co. has paid four three-
penny dividends during the past year
and shares are quoted round about 3s. 7d.
* * * *
Carbine Gold Mines has without cost
secured a further extension, until May 15,
1941, of its option on two blocks adjoin-
ing the Bellevue mine at Ora Banda
(W.A.), which it prospected for some time
and which it lately bought for £ll,OOO.
After drawing several auriferous blanks
in the last eight years, co. believes that in
Bellevue it has a prize.
* * * *
Apex and Kimberley Options, two
Westralian goldmining ventures which
have had little to say for some time,
issued reports for the year ended June.
Apex claims to have got something that
looks promising, but adds that operations
have been temporarily suspended pend-
ing treatment of a little ore at grass.
Cash is only £l4; debit balance is
£13,222. Kimberley Options, after aban-
doning an oil concession, later acquired
the Patricia mine, near Edjudina, which
is being worked on tribute. Last year
£214 was received in royalty; it has
£2048 invested, and it is glancing about
for another property.
* * * *
Westralian October gold yield, at
125,278 fine ounces, was nearly 29,0000 z.
above that for September, and with the
exception of the 136,287-fine-ounce out-
turn in Sept., 1939, when producers raked
in all they could to get full benefit of the
increased price of the metal, was the best
monthly return for 29 years. October’s
big increase is attributed to all-round ex-
pansion in the industry and the inclu-
sion of some prospectors’ “clean-ups
before Christmas.” Still, partly owing
to the falling-off in output of Great
Boulder and one or two others, the State
tally for the 10 months of the current
year (1,010,7340 z.) is only 8160 oz. ahead
of the same period of 1939.
* * * *
Paringa (W.A.) estimated September
quarter’s gold production from its north-
end Kalgoorlie Golden Mile mines at
5326 fine ounces, valued at £A51,984.
Mill profit is stated at £18,539. For the
financial year to August 31 production of
21,400 fine ounces is valued at £209,205,
deducting realisation and gold tax, and
profit is estimated at £83,850. Septem-
ber quarter development, principally
confined to the 300 ft., 400 ft. and 640 ft.
levels, is stated to have furnished some
important results.
* * * *
The deep mines of Ravenswood (N.Q.)
seem to have done their dash, but this
old goldfield still keeps in the records
with shallow workings on small rich reefs.
New Otazel is driving on one of these at
the 120 ft. level and picking up heavily
mineralised ore worth 3oz. to 4oz. per
ton. The reef is small, ranging from 3in.
to 12in. Prill ore goes to Chillagoe
Smelters, but there are bigger tonnages
of seconds for local treatment. The
dumps of the old English co. piloted by
A. L. Wilson in the ’nineties now con-
tribute to the field’s output, and the big
Sunset Spur dumps are showing that they
carried a ’weight or two all over.
* * * *
Two companies are prospecting for
quicksilver ore in the belt of country
between Kilkivan and Cinnabar (Q.), but
only small recovery of mercury has been
established so far. The value of ore
treated was under £4OO for October.
Queensland Quicksilver, Ltd., on the
Kilkivan Mineral Freehold, is expecting
to increase production considerably dur-
ing 1941 as a result of development work.
Q.S. Mines, Ltd., has sunk several pros-
pecting shafts at Cinnabar, but has not
reported any definite results, though low-
grade ore has been treated recently.
Meanwhile, only restricted supplies of
quicksilver are available in Australia.
* * * *
Mt. Martin, N.L., after successively
trying its luck during the past six years
near Kalgoorlie (W.A.) and Emmaville
and Wellington (N.S.W.), has moved to
Bendigo (Vic.), where it intends to form
a co. to work the Golden Deborah lease
and to prospect three other neighboring
blocks on its own account. Nothing is
said about finances, which weren’t im-
pressive-looking in the last accounts.
* * * *
Freney Oil (W.A.) announces another
stoppage. This time, “owing to the per-
sistence of gas showings, it is considered
unwise to proceed with deeper drilling
until the safety equipment, including a
blowout-preventer and gas valve ordered
from the Commonwealth Government,
comes to hand.” Something is also said
about the drilling staff being confronted,
owing to unprecedented geological con-
ditions, with the greatest possible diffi-
culties, and also that the equipment,
which is usually efficient for ordinary
rock-drilling, has been found totally in-
adequate. The release of this informa-
tion gave the market a blow.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
S.McA.: Don’t buy any more.. . .Tassie:
The shares have little investment attraction at
the present price of 11s. 6d. ... D.C.R.: (1)
Have little information on this concern, but not
specially attracted by it. (2) The outlook isn’t
as good as it was; wouldn't count too much
on future prospects. (3) If the scrip comes
back to near 10s. it should be worth buying.
(4) Adelaide Steam and Holeproof Hosiery....
Credit Cost: The Commonwealth Bank lends
its notes; it doesn’t give them to anyone ex-
cept when it buys something, such as property,
gold, etc. Any interest earned on such loans,
investment, etc., is clear profit (after charging
office exes., etc.), since no interest has to be
paid by the bank itself on the money it has
created. That is how profits on the note issue
occur. But there are decided limits on the ex-
tent of the note issue and profits therefrom.
The public has almost always been able to get
all the notes it wants to borrow provided the
security offered has been sound.

Isn’t this new army of ours going all

It seemed to start with the cooking.
Instead of the swaddie lining up in the
good old way and nipping the “bab” for
a drop of tea to wash yesterday’s high-
grease mark off his dixie before the
poisoner plonked into it a ladleful of
murky stew and a morsel of bilious-
looking cabbage, he now sits down before
an array of gleaming cutlery and snowy
napery to devilled kidneys on toast or
baked beans to ensure that he has a suffi-
ciency of vitamin C or something.
“Lance-corporal” bacon and milkless
burgoo that one could drink through a
straw one morning and cut with a knife
and fork the next — that was the fodder
to train on.
In the old army the Digger didn’t need
to worry about doing violent exercise or
going in for a swim immediately after
dinner. There was no likelihood he’d
suffer from stomach cramps. In fact, if
he stopped to tie up a bootlace after
“cookhouse” had gone he’d miss out
altogether. But with the new system of
four-course feeding, all the Digger can
do is stagger to the nearest pillow and
park his distended chassis on it until it
subsides.
Appointments of business managers,
too, have clipped the wings of expan-
siveness which the old-time brasshats
sprouted so readily. When the Camp
Commandant got word, say, that his
camp was to be extended to take 100
additional recruits he would tell his Q.M.
to order enough tents, etc., “for 200 —
they say they’ll only send 100, but you
know what h.q. are. In fact, we’d better
be on the safe side and make it 250.”
That was the spirit in those days—
bigheartedness. Damn the cost! Of
course, a year or so later, when the war
was over, the 220 unused and mildewed
tents, etc., would be sold at Is. 4|d. ea.
But who cared? One thing about the
general who tossed the taxpayer’s cash
around so generously, his troops didn t
have to stack in 16 to a tent, with a few
more trying to sneak in under the flap.
As it is now, the application for equip-
ment, etc., for the extra 100 has to be
put on requisition form 11758 in tripli-
cate, signed, sent to G.H.Q., countersigned,
sent to Base Records, thence to Reclama-
tions Officer, and on to the Business
Board, considered, reconsidered, referred
to Financial Adviser, thence to Parlia-
mentary Select Committee, to the Prices
Commissioner, to A.A.Q.M.G. and so
on. By that time the Business Board is
roaring like a bull elephant about the cost
of billeting the 100 pending authorisation
of issue of tents, etc., for them. Still,
the taxpayer now knows that instead of
his money being flung down the drain it
is being placed there gently.
And now scientific washing! Can you
see the sar’-major at washing drill?
He clears his throat and in a cultured
voice says “Now, gentlemen” —the old
“youse blokes” was buried reverently with
puttees, bandoliers, etc. —“we will take the
washing of your giggle-suits by numbers.
“When I say ‘One!’ plunge the suits in
the water, which you will have already
brought to the correct degree of oxygen-
isation with your issue of number four-
teen powder. Coat collar to the right,
pants legs to the left. On the command
‘Two!’ move your right hand, grasping
the coat collar, smartly over your left
hand, holding the pants. Continue rub-
bing until all dirt is removed. After
that we will have rinsing and blueing,
taking your own time. This afternoon
we will do coloreds and woollies. To-
morrow morning we will have folding,
ironing and airing by numbers. Now, are
you ready? H’rr-umph, raise suits! Pick
it up, there! Pick it up!”
Before he goes away the new Digger
may even become a change-daily boy.
Once on active service he’ll do just the
same as the old Digger scrounge a
kerosene-tin from somewhere if he can’t
get a spare dixie from the cookhouse.
Into it he will ram everything he can
squeeze in: socks, breeches, shirts, towels,
scarves, singlets, etc. ; wool, silk, cotton
or hessian, it doesn’t matter. Next he
will pinch firewood, or, perhaps, the box
the sergeant sits on in the orderly room.
The petrol tank of the colonel’s car will
ensure quick starting for his fire. He
should allow it to boil one to four hours.
Those not burnt after boiling dry empty
out, stamp any water out of them, hang
up somewhere.
Admittedly the woollen socks may have
to be put under a moving tank to restore
pliability, while the tops of them may
disappear inside the boots. Also, the
singlets will possibly finish at the shoulder-
blades and the dye from the Balaclava
the girl sent will render the shirt piebald.
But who gives a damn, anyway? After
all, he didn’t pay for it.
But, anyway, won’t this new camp
washing technique lead to some confu-
sion? How will a fellow, on the order
“Stand by your suds!” know whether to
rush to the washhouse or the wet can-
teen?

When all the talk is carnivals
And junketing and social calls
And other things irrelevant,
There’s one who runs an all-day show
(Without whom Christmas v>ould be
slow),
And so, right here I rise to throw
My bouquet at the elephant.
No human cussedness can stir
The deep, unruffled calm of her;
She looks upon the human race
With patience and benignity.
She takes her chattering load each day,
And eats a ton or so of hay,
And so maintains her dignity.
The ultra-modern craze for speed
Has left her very cold indeed,
And each remark on time she treats
As just a passing platitude;
And if upon this Vale of Tears
You stayed for several hundred years,
Then you might seriously incline
To change your mental attitude.

Steady Job Wanted.
“The desire of 90 men out of every 100 is
to have a steady job.”— "Sun.”
That’s just what I say. The reason I
have left so many jobs during the last
year is that the blasted things have been
unsteady.
Take that clerking job I had. When
I came back from lunch at the corner
pub the cashbook rose up from the desk
and hit me on the nose, and as I looked
for a grip to keep my balance the ink
upset all over a pile of ledger cards. I
was just telling the office boy what I
thought of a man who ran an office
where things were so unsteady when he
changed himself into the manager, and
when I picked myself up at the foot of
the stairs I somehow guessed that I had
been fired.
Well, 1 don’t mind what I do for a
living, and if it hadn’t been for the way
the road on which we were toiling was
whirling around on my next job I
would not have hit the foreman on the
head with a pick. I did not wait for
him to recover. He looked an unreason-
able sort of man.
When I took that job as a chauffeur
something similar occurred. The way
the other cars wobbled about, sometimes
splitting into two and passing me one on
each side, was confusing, so that when
I saw three telegraph poles standing (or
rather wriggling) close together, I thought
that the centre one was probably imagi-
nary, and if I drove right behind the
other two I’d probably be all right. It
was a mistake, of course.
It’s been like that in all my other jobs.
It’s all very well for bosses to talk about
drink, but isn’t an unsteady job enough
to make a man drink? Give me a
steady job and I’ll be all right.

MOST IMPORTANT
INDUSTRIES

HERE is little need for stating that wool production is
Australia’s number one primary industry, for it is well known
that Australia is the world’s greatest wool producing country.
But today not only does Australia produce wool, she also
produces wool yarns and fabrics, too, of equal qualities—and
in many cases of superior qualities—to those of overseas
manufacturers. Australia also supplies materials for export as
well as providing the best for Australians themselves.
Yarra Falls, Limited, stands in the lead for enterprise,
progress and achievement.
Established in 1917 —the record of Yarra Falls, Limited, is
one of outstanding progress, and today, with its paid-up capital
of jC 1,000,000, with its using of 18,000 bales of wool per annum
(approximately wor th per week), its production of
2,500,0001 b. of yarn and 1,750,000 yards of high-grade cloths
per annum, it is justly rated as operating one of Australia’s
most important industries.
Yarra Falls Mills are the largest Textile Mills in the Southern
Hemisphere, covering a floor space of over 12 acres, and with
1550 employees on the payroll.
At Yarra Falls Mills the best types of Australian-grown pure
wools are converted into yarns and fabrics, including Worsted
Knitting and Weaving Yarns, Twills and Fancy Worsted
Suitings, Venetians, Baratheas, Covert Coatings, Wool Crepes
and Wool Georgettes as well as large quantities of the better
type of fabric required for Defence purposes.
In piece-dyed fabrics Yarra Falls have perfected over 1100
shades of delicate variations of toning.
In “dyed-in-the-wool” yarns they have produced more than
1600 solid shades with combinations giving unlimited variety
of tonings.
Every step of the cloth maker’s art is followed through at
Yarra Falls Mills until the finished cloth—quality, design and
colour —is equal to the world’s best.

Among the Maoris
THE WHARE
By DOUGLAS STEWART
I T was six months since those fleas had tasted any-
thing but Maori. They leapt at a white skin like
a shoal of herrings at a loaf of bread. They came
from the dust under the raupo mats and they were
there in millions. Every ten minutes or so when the
irritation became unendurable, you could roll up your
trousers and scrape them off like sand or bid-a-bid
seeds. But attacking them was a waste of time, and
unless a particularly savage pang forced you into
action, you just sat and let yourself be devoured.
The old chief and his wife, with their hard,
leathery skins, hardly seemed to notice them. Some-
times when the woman saw that I was in trouble she
would say “Ah! You got te flea, eh!” and she would
promise to boil a kerosene-tin of water, shift the mats-
and scald the brutes to death. “T’ose flea! We boil
’em, t’at te way to fix ’em! ” If the chief on some rare
occasion, sitting by the open fire in the whare at night,
felt a pinprick through his hide, he said “Flea!
Bitem!” in a tone of pleased discovery. He took a
pride in his fleas. Their presence cheered him, their
habits interested him, and their prowess delighted him.
They were his lares et penates, or the flocks and herds
of a patriarch.
Maybe I exaggerate the importance of the fleas.
In the long run, for there were processes of the mind
more powerful than those ridiculous irritations of the
flesh, I should probably have come to the same
decision without their prompting. But I don’t want
memory, always a romantic, to sentimentalise them
out of existence. They did force a decision.
J DRIFTED into the Maori settlement with the great-
* est simplicity. I was trudging along the road in the
sunny midday, heading north, when a tall native, riding
bareback on an old grey mare, came cantering up the
road behind me. He stopped short beside me, the
mare grunting with relief and indignation, and said,
“You’ve got a heavy swag, Jack. Carry it for you?”
The morning seemed sunnier after that. It was
good to be able to walk freely. The road wound along
a ridge from which the ragged country, broken into
gullies and patchworked with leaden ti-tree and an
occasional acre of ploughed land or yellowish grass,
fell with the slow sweep of a glacier into
the shallow harbor of Kaipara. The water,
so far away, had lost its quick sparkle and
become some new element more like metal,
a sheet of silvery tinfoil among the gigantic
hills. It was hard, desolate country, but
it couldn’t depress you when the sun was
shining on the red-clay cuttings and the
mare’s hooves were clip-clopping on the
stones, and you had nothing to do but walk
along the road and look at things.
The Maori, who seemed about 35 years
old, was slim and sombre. He spoke little,
and appeared to be turning something over
in his mind. At last he said, “My father
will give you some lunch.”
I said “Good!” and then wished I
hadn’t, for the monosyllable might have
sounded like pidgin-English, and his own
was perfect. He had probably been to one
of the Maori colleges and then, as most of
his people do, come back to the pa.
We plodded on until we caught sight of a tumble-
down whare standing among the rushes of an upland
swamp on a plateau above the harbor. “That’s my
place,” said the horseman. “You can sleep there if you
like, have a rest for a day or two. I don’t live there
now.
“It’s pretty rough,” he added.
He wasn’t very enthusiastic. Afterwards I found
out that various swaggies in the past had abused the
hospitality of the little tribe, and I came to the con-
clusion that the young Maori resented it and that,
although the tradition of welcome to the stranger was
too strong for him to break, maybe his children would
rebel against it.
The whare, like all deserted houses, was dirty and
forlorn. The broken iron bedstead, the torn mats, the
cooking-pot lying on its side in the dust, the rain-
sodden long-dead ashes, the cobwebs and the rat-
droppings —they were the apparatus of ghosts. Behind
the building was the Maori’s inevitable totem —a
broken-down limousine, rusting into the grass. The
Maori dropped my swag and we went back to the road
and up to the settlement on the hillside.
Half a dozen Maoris, squatting on the grass out-
side one of the whares, stared at us in good-humored
curiosity. They were all eating and drinking. One
of the young fellows said something in Maori to a
squat, dumpy girl, and she laughed. They went on
eating.
The Maori took me to the whare door and intro-
duced me to his father and mother, chief and chieftain-
ess of the settlement. The woman, bent and skinny
and weather-beaten like a twist of withered grass,
smiled a welcome. From her beaked nose her face
fell away in a landslide of wrinkles to a toothless
mouth, achieving some dignity again in a firm, tattooed
chin. The old man had the stamp of aristocracy
both in manners and features. His hair and moustache
were grey, his brown eyes clear, his cheeks smooth.
But for his coloring and his thick lower lip he could
have passed for a European.
“Eh, Jack,” he said, “you come a long way?”
“From Taranaki,” I told him.
“Eh, Tara-naki,” he drawled in soft amazement,
as if I had come from the moon. His geography was
vague. He had been to Auckland, though. He and
the old woman had stayed with relations in the city—
probably at that squalid settlement by the blue harbor
—for several months, and then come back to the
kumara patch and the whare. I imagined them labor-
ing along Queen-street, staring in wonder and delight
at the shops and the traffic. It would be like a visit to
a foreign country.
The woman came out of the darkness of the
whare with a mug of tea and a plate piled with pipis
and something which looked like green string and
which I was told was boiled watercress.
“You like te pipi?”
“Kapai!”
“Kapai!” She laughed. There was no fear of
insulting her by using pidgin-English. Her pakeha
vocabulary was small, and you had to speak simply
and slowly to make her understand. She treated the
barrier of tongues as a joke, laughing with pleasure
when she could comprehend and with amusement
when she couldn’t. Her conversation was full of
expressive “what-you-callums.”
Some sort of council-of-war, which I sensed con-
cerned me, went on while I was negotiating the shell-
fish and the boiled watercress (which tasted like
barb-wire), and when it was over the young Maori
went off on the mare and the old man said, “You
stay wit’ me, eh, Jack? T’at other place no good.
You stay here wit’ me. The missus make you a bed
in te wharepuni.”
“I Wonder , Willum, if they'll let us keep one for sooveneer?”
That was better. The deserted whare would have
given you the horrors. Only I had yet to meet the
fleas.
r T'HAT first night, sitting around the fire with the
* two old Maoris, I found everything, even the fleas,
strange and exhilarating. It was an open fire built
on the dust in a sort of alcove at one end of the
whare, and the smoke, guided by the corrugated-iron
walls of the alcove, found an uncertain track to a hole
in the roof. Strips of shark meat and bunches of
reddish corncobs hung on the walls, drying in the heat
and collecting the savor of smoke and smuts. The
firelight danced across the room, coloring the far
wall and giving a touch of mystery to the Maoris’
sleeping-place—a continuation of the main room,
screened by a wall of mats. The narrow entrance and
the black interior made it look like a cave. The room
where we sat was full of moving shadows, with high-
lights glowing on the bare table and the wooden form
beside it, and gleaming on a shelf of chipped crockery.
Near the fire stood a kerosene-tin of pipis. A big
enamel teapot rested at the edge of the embers and an
iron kettle swung over the flames.
We drank many cups of tea, ate pipis and smoked.
The teapot, steaming by the fire day after day, was
never emptied. When the black juice ran low, the
old man would throw in a handful of tea-leaves and
pour in boiling water.
The woman, washing dishes, mixing a damper or
peeling kumaras, was always busy in a leisurely,
mechanical way. Sometimes, in a cracked voice, she
sang a fragment of a Maori song. I asked her to sing
the cradle song “Hine e Hine” for me, and she was
pleased, and sang the sweet air through. But she
sang very badly. I talked to her about bird-voiced
Ana Hato at Rotorua. She made a show of interest,
but it was only her politeness. She wanted to peel the
kumaras and sing to herself in her cracked voice and
not to talk. I remembered the grey Tuwehirangi at
Manutahi, reputed to be 115 years old, who would
simply walk away when a white man talked to her.
She wasn’t interested. The old Maori women like to
gossip with each other.
The old man, brightening at the mention of
Rotorua, told me he had a cousin there. It was a peg
to hang a conversation on, but the conversation
wouldn’t follow. There was no common ground on
which we could meet, and, worse, no common back-
ground where the pakeha’s way of thought could have
commerce with the Maori’s. Instead of asking him
about the ancient legends of his race, I fell back on
the fleas. We had them in common, anyhow.
When it came to supper-time, he said, “You rest
tomorrow, Jack. You done up. You don’t do any-
t’ing tomorrow and t’en we see. Maybe you stay wit’
us for a while.”
He’d already begun to say that word “Jack” in a
different tone. At first, especially with the young
Maori, it was the familiar, faintly contemptuous nick-
name that would be fastened on a stray dog and a
swaggie alike, and I had been inclined to resent it.
Now it had become my name, not my nickname.
He led me over to the meeting-house, a long, low,
gusty barn of a building where the old woman, by
piling mats on an iron bedstead, had made me a
sleeping-place. A cloud of sparrows stormed from the
rafters, chirping in alarm. When the old man had
gone, I lifted one of the mats and saw that here, too,
the livestock abounded. There was nothing to be done
about it; I lay down on the mats. Rats began to
squeak and rustle and thump about the floor, and
cautiously in twos and threes the sparrows came back.
Tired, and feeling security in the roof and the
bed despite the rats and sparrows, I slept that night.
"T HE next night was harder. I felt a bit foolish and
* out of place to be living with the Maoris, and lay
awake thinking things over. My bloodthirsty bed-
fellows made sleep impossible. In the early hours of
the morning I put on an overcoat and sat out on the
hillside, looking at the harbor and waiting for day-
light. The landscape had the dramatic, electric still-
ness of night, as if the hills as well as the sweet-
scented moonlit ti-tree, stretching for miles, had
awakened into some secret life quite different from
their torpor in the daylight. The harbor, too, was
brighter by moonlight than sunlight, a wash of pure
silver around the dark bases of the ranges. A faint
rushing sound might have been air dragging across
the valleys, or the waves breaking on the coast, a long
way off. I thought of Auckland asleep, and the two
old Maoris asleep on the mats in the cubby-hole at the
end of their whare, so remote from the city, lapped
in this tranquillity, as self-sufficient as the fallow deer
on the ridges beyond Wanganui or the wild drake and
his mate that nested on the cliff above the Waingong-
ora at home.
I had loafed all day. The old man disappeared
and came back in the evening and gave me a tin of
tobacco he had bought for me at the store. I didn’t
want to take it, but couldn’t refuse for fear of offend-
ing him. In the whare at night, breaking one of his
long silences, he told me about the white woman
God knows who she was, and how poverty-stricken
or how mad she was to be tramping the lonely road
through the ti-tree —who had stayed at the pa all
through the spring, and about a white man who had


stayed for six months and then slipped away in the
night, stealing their blankets and an axe.
“He need ’em, or else he wouldn’t take ’em,” the
Maori woman said.
“Aye, t’at orright,” the old man agreed. “If he
want ’em he can have ’em. He can come back again
if he want to, t’at one.”
I began to understand something of Maori hos-
pitality and of their outlook on life, simple but realistic,
tolerant but not sentimental. It arose partly from
the fact that understanding was easier than anger.
They were happy and didn’t want their happiness to
be disturbed by the feeling that they had been let
down.
It became obvious that they were expecting me
to stay for a long time. They were hinting at that by
telling me about the others. I had a notion they liked
having a pet white man about the place. It satisfied
their religious instincts in a way as well as their good
nature. Yoq were at once a homeless dog to be com-
forted, a fabulous animal to wonder at, and a god
to be propitiated. Owning you enhanced the chief’s
prestige in the pa, and gave the old couple something
different to do, something different to talk about.
'T' HERE was no effort of adjustment needed to settle
* into the life. You ate and slept and scratched and
from time to time said something, not so much for its
meaning but as a token of friendship. You said some-
thing to the old woman, or she said something to
you, in the comradely way you’d talk to a dog you
were fond of. The response was the same —a tail
wagged in the mind.
On the second day I helped the tribe to store
the kumaras for the winter. They gave me a black
stallion to ride—not, unfortunately, a great proud
snorting beast with a fiery eye and a flowing mane,
but a typical product of Maori horsebreeding, a dusty,
ragged, somnambulistic runt —and I made repeated
trips from the whare to the field across the road where
the women were digging the earthy red-purple sweet-
potatoes. Taking their time about it, grubbing in the
earth with their hands, they’d fill a sack and lift it up
to me while I sat on the stallion. They cracked jokes
to each other in Maori and laughed a lot.
The men had a pit dug at the back of the whare,
lined with fern leaves. They tipped the kumaras into
the pit and, when there was a fair-sized mound, laid
more fern leaves around the sides and on top, then
covered the pile with clay. It was easy work, very
pleasant in the light May sunshine. The men smoked
and lazed between trips. Nobody hurried. The little
stallion was the only one tired enough to feel relieved
when I brought the last load home in the dark and
sent him off into the ti-tree with a smack on the rump.
D OTH the Maoris were sympathetic about the fleas
that night. They would “get te boiling water and
kill ’em all for sure” one day—tomorrow. It wouldn’t
be long till the frosts came, and they weren’t so bad
then.
The futile promises were a bit irritating; the
fleas were maddening. I’d get up and stamp
about the room for relief, then sit down beside the
old man and stare at the fire again. When the fleas
had drunk their fill and were sleeping it off, there was
something curiously attractive about the whare,
especially one night when it rained and the big drops
fell hissing into the fire. You thought of those miles
of lonely wet hills, and it was good to be indoors. We
sat for hours, it seemed, without talking, listening
to the rain hammering on the iron roof. It drove
us closer together, wove us into a primitive human
companionship—three against the storm. I imagined
the old couple sitting together by the fire year after
year, and saw myself with them, staring at the flames
interminably, not talking and not thinking, sunk in a
dark tide of physical sympathy, with somewhere in
the chasms of the mind a vague sadness. There was
a touch of nightmare about the vision and afterwards
it haunted me.
That wet night the woman, grinning, asked me,
“You got a girl, eh? You sad. You got a girl some-
where, a long way away? You leave te girl behind
and forget her now?”
“Yes,” I told her. “I’ve got a girl. She’s a long
way away.”
“Maybe you get te Maori girl, eh? How you like
te Maori wife?”
Then she told me there was to be a dance at the
meeting-house on the Saturday. “You meet te nice
girl at te dance. Plenty wahineJ”
When I was alone with the rats and sparrows,
with the feeble light of the candle emphasising the
cavernous gloom of the wharepuni, I began to see that
the woman had been testing me out. The old man
that day had bought me another tin of tobacco and
broached a great scheme whereby we were going to
earn £l2 between us cutting rushes for a pakeha
farmer down the road. Before the job started, we were
to go down to the harbor and get in a store of pipis
from the mudflats. He was including me in all his
plans as a matter of course. I had come to stay.
“You not want to go, eh? You stay here as
long as you like. You stay wit’ us.”
“You not want to go away.”
I didn’t work the next day. I felt restless and
went for a walk along the road. A farmer —perhaps
the one for whom we were to cut the rushes —saw me
leaning over a bridge and had a yarn. He said if I
registered on the unemployed he’d give me a job, with
five bob a week added to the Government subsidy.
1 told him I’d think it over.
I was thinking everything over, and thinking with
a queer urgency, almost panic, in the whare that night.
“Tomorrow we get te pipi.”
“We cut te rushes, contrac’ for a fortnight; make
twelve poun’.”
“Plenty nice Maori girl come on Saturday.”
“You not want to go away.”
Well, it would be interesting getting the pipis.
I’d often watched the Maoris wading in shallow
waters and reaching into the blue mud for the shell-
fish, and it would be good to help them. I wouldn’t
mind rush-cutting, either. That would be something
new and it ought to be as pleasant as scything the
ragwort at Whangamomona. As for a Maori girl,
the ukuleles and steel guitars and the rattletrap piano
all going like mad and the young bucks shouting the
choruses —the way I’d often seen them —good!
Or would it be? Wouldn’t you be isolated, mooch-
ing about on your own between dances, a stranger at
the party? Maybe they’d be a bit antagonistic ; cer-
tainly they’d be curious. Even if they gave you a good
time and you joined in the singing, you’d be acting a
part. You didn’t belong.
“How you like te Maori wife, eh, Jack?”
I looked at the old couple, nodding by the fire, the
light on their dark faces. What did I.really know
about them? What went on in those secretive Maori
minds? They weren’t animals. They had their own
thoughts, based on a conception of life beyond my
understanding. What possible communion could there
be between the white man and the native? The memory
of that deep, mindless sympathy when we sat quietly
by the fire on the wet night was uncannily disturbing,
horrible. The friendly little whare was a prison.
“T’at flea! Tomorrow I kill te lot of ’em.”
When I went to' bed, they bit like devils. It was
going to be a long, restless night. I thought of the
Maoris’ incredible kindliness. What lovable people
they were! But I saw how their generosity was
binding me to them. “Tomorrow we get te pipis.”
“Next week we cut te rushes.” Next month, next
year . . .
After a while I climbed out of bed and wrote a
note. “Thank you for being so good to me. I hope
I can repay you some day. I’m sorry to go away like
this without saying good-bye. I hope you’ll under-
stand ; it’s just that I have to be moving on. Don’t
think I’m not grateful.—Jack.”
Feeling as guilty as if I’d been the swaggie who
stole the blankets, I packed my swag and crept out of
the whare. There was a full moon, and the old mys-
terious enchantment in the vast hills and the ti-tree.
Along the ridge above the glitter of the harbor, the
road was white. I could have shouted for joy at the
way it ran over the rise and disappeared into the
country I’d never seen.
I walked hard all night, half-expecting to see the
young Maori come galloping after me on the indignant
grey mare and force me to go back to the pa for
fear of hurting his feelings.

BAD DEBTS
By KATHARINE SUSANNAH PRICHARD.
H> AD debts?” said Bill Langham. “Wish I had
a few more like the one I squared up with
I J Pinchgut Jo.”
The men were yarning round their camp-
fire on a show in the Black Range, out from Mt. Sir
Samuel. Old-timers all of them, they were remember-
ing the fortunes they had made and lost in the days
when sinking a shaft in likely country brought a man
more than tucker for his pains.
Their tents sprouted, tawny and dust-raddled,
among rocks on the brow of the ridge. From the
ridge the plains stretched north and east, under mulga
scrub, for hundreds of miles. Mists, blue-grey and
lavender, made the plains look like a vast inland sea
in the evening light; but there was no water beneath
those mists. The country lay dry and drought-stricken:
not a blade of green to be seen anywhere. Even the
mulga was dying. Once a week Bill had taken a truck-
load of ore into the battery at the Mount and brought
back a tank of water, but it was a couple of months
now since a crushing had paid its way.
The lode Macartney and his mates were working
had petered out and vanished. Bill Langham was
fed-up with trying to locate it again. He decided that
he was going to break away. Macartney wanted to
hang on a bit longer. He still had confidence in the
mine: believed they would strike a rich patch if they
hung on a bit longer.
“Gold’s always been freakish out here,” Mac
maintained, “cornin’ and goin’ without rhyme or
reason.”
He was sure they were on a good thing, and if
Mac felt like that Shifty was satisfied there was gold
about. He had tried to convince Bill, butit was useless
to argue with him. They had given the ground a
fair go, Bill said, and there were better propositions
for a man to put in his time on. Either Mac and
Shifty would come with him or he would have to
leave them out there on the ridge to make the best
arrangements they could about stores and water.
Bill thought he could carry things with a high
hand because he owned the truck, although he had
agreed when the party started out prospecting that
Mac was to be in charge of operations and he would
abide by Mac’s decisions. Earlier in the evening, Mac
had drawn up a rough and ready document on a piece
of brown paper, and Bill had signed it, relinquishing
all rights and interests in the lease. He intended to
push off next day. Mac was sore, but gave no indica-
tion of bearing Bill any ill-will as they yarned by the
campfire. Only Shifty brooded over the risk he and
Mac would have to face of doing a perish for water
when Bill took the truck. The nearest well was twelve
miles away to the south-west, and, although they had
enough water to carry on with for a couple of weeks,
Shifty did not fancy tramping those miles for more,
or the off-chance of getting a lift from other pros-
pectors on the track to the Mount when their
stores gave out.
“If you’ve got any advice about col-
lectin’ bad debts, Bill,” he said, “spit it out.
I’d be a rich man if I could cash in on some
of the money owin’ to me.”
A little screw of a man, but tough and
wiry, Shifty glanced across at Macartney,
stirring the ashes in the bowl of his pipe.
They had been mates for years, and Shifty
swore that if any man could smell gold Mac
could. He had opened up two or three new
fields, made money and put it into the ground
again by way of mining investments. Bill and his truck
were more or less of a blow-in on the partnership,
though they were all well known to one another ; had
knocked about on rushes up and down the country
for the last thirty years.
Bill Langham laughed, stretching his long legs.
“It wouldn’t be much good to you, Shifty, tryin’ my
method. You’d have to be twenty years younger and
in training. But this is how it was. I started out on
me own, workin’ for a blacksmith. Blacksmith’s
striker I was, at ten bob a week, when I was fourteen.
Dropped it for a job with a survey party at nine bob
a day. Worked overland with the survey to Cool-
gardie: was paid off with £5O.
“The old camp was boomin’ in those days, and
Pinchgut Jo Harris was knocking about, doin’ a bit of
dealin’, and playin’ poker with anybody who’d play
with him. He was so mean, the boys used to say,
he’d pinch the gut off of you and say it wasn’t worth
payin’ for. Remember Pinchgut, Shifty?”
“Do I remember him?” Shifty yelped. “Loaned
him a camel to cart water on Kurnalpi, and that was
the last I seen of it.”
“Well, Pinchgut sort of took a fancy to me. At
least, I reckoned he did. I was a big husky kid, but
silly as a meat-axe. Course, I never let on what my
age was, and it flattered me no end being taken up by
the great man. We all thought Mr. Harris was
well-in, had made more buyin’ and sellin’ stock and
gear than most men made on the mines ; so when
he started yarnin’ to me I thought maybe there was a
job in the wind and my luck was in.
“We went over to the pub for a friendly little
game, jest to pass the time. No, I didn’t drink, and
he kind of approved. We started to play with just a
little bit on to liven it up, and Mr. Harris warned me
against playin’ for big stakes. Very kind and fatherly
he was. Towards morning I discovered I’d lost
nearly all me money.
“ ‘Here,’ I ups and ses, boy-fashion, ‘you’re cheat-
ing!’ He bangs me one fair between the eyes, and
out I go to it.
“Eighteen years afterwards I was in Kalgoorlie,
out of a job, stony, motherless broke, but fit. Walk-
ing along Hannan-street who should I come face to
face with but Pinchgut. I stopped dead.
“ ‘Why,’ I ses, ‘it’s Mr. Jo Harris, isn’t it?’
“ ‘Sure,’ he ses.
“ ‘Come and have a drink,’ I ses pleasantly, ‘jest
to show I bear you no ill-will for that dinnyhazer you
gave me.’
“Pinchgut followed me into the pub. Laughing
and talking over a couple of pots, he boasted about
how well he was doing, the money he’d made. Gave
me his card: Mr. Joseph Harris, Tattersall’s Club and


Dingo wasn’t satisfied. That tucked-up look of
Yarda, that uneasy shifting of eyes and shoulders was
something new. Dingo said “Good-oh,” and went in
casually to have his tea, but he wasn’t letting it go at
that. Mollie wanted him to come for a last walk
after tea. In the morning she was catching the No.
2 east; the look she handed Dingo when he said he’d
got to go over to Yarda’s was a bad knock. But he
went.
The sun lay low down and the bushes made long
thin shadows on the hard soil. The plain lay like a
saucer, there wasn’t a sign of life except for the
station buildings and engine sheds, and as soon as
Dingo got a bit away from them they looked like toys.
There was a sort of queer stillness at the humpy,
too. When Dingo got round to the back he found
Yarda and the woman sitting dead silent in front of
a dead fire. They’d got the dogs and the kids with
them, tucked up and silent like Dingo had never seen
dogs or kids.
WHEN he got back to Ward’s, Dingo kept his pipe
in his mouth all evening, not saying a word till
even Ward barracked him. Mollie passed back and
forth with her arms full of clothes, meeting Dingo’s
watchful eyes till at last he knocked out his pipe and
stood up. “Come on out,” he said, and for once
Mollie followed without a word.
They stood by the little fence watching the plain
where it stretched dark and flat as the sea.
“There’s a lot I’d meant to say,” Dingo started,
“but I reckon I was wrong. Tonight I was going to
tell you I was packing up, too, coming down to the
city and starting in to make meself over a bit”
Mollie’s voice rose like a song. “For me? You’d
have done that for me?”
He stiffened as though to resist her voice. “Yeah,
I. would have. But not now. Not since Yarda come
in. It ’ud be no good, Moll. The desert is in me ; I
gotter have the earth and the skies”
He was going on, but Mollie butted in. “You
can have them,” she said. “You can have them—
and me too. You can keep the earth and the skies.
The city can go.”
He asked did she mean it, was she game, would
she come out into the desert, a trapper’s wife? She
said yes ; she meant it. Why should he doubt she
could come—had he not just said that for her sake
he would
“I said not now. Not since Yarda’s come back.”
Mollie’s fingers stiffened and Dingo let go.
“Yarda?” she said. “What’s this got to do with
Yarda?”
“That’s it,” Dingo answered. “It was Yarda
made me see I couldn’t go the city way.” He was
looking out to the horizon or he’d have seen Mollie
freeze up at the tone of his voice. “Those hoboes,
that city scum. Yarda —he’s a real man, but he’s
got the native blood in him and he’s scared. Scared
to death.”
“I don’t see” began Mollie.
“Out there, down near the Bight, there’s a few
wild abos. still. All right if you treat ’em proper.
I see their smoke sometimes, but they never worry
me. I respect them, and they got sense. They got
a few waterholes too. You know how thirsty the
country can be. Those holes matter. The hoboes,
they got a record pelt haul in the time they was out.
I wondered how. Yarda told me. They poisoned
one of the waterholes. They got the dogs all
Yarda, he told ’em not to use poison. He told ’em it
was dangerous, he told ’em it was murder. They
laughed at him. They said, anyhow, what was an abo.
more or less? What was the use of hanging round for
weeks out on the stony when they could collect
the needful quick and lively, and off into Kalgoorlie?
Yarda said he put up a smoke to see if there was
any tribe around, but he got no answer. He reckone
all he could do was hope for the best. He put some
sort of sign at the hole, but he’s not from that
country and he reckoned there wasn’t much hope
that the sign would be understood. The hoboes,
they moved on and did some more trapping, and
Yarda stopped with them because I’d said he’d got to.
But he didn’t like it. Moreover, I reckon they
treated him pretty rough and ready, though he don t
say much.”
Mollie shifted a little. “Did anything happen?”
“Yes. A few days ago Yarda picked up from
some travelling abos. how a party of myalls got
sick after drinking water at one of the holes a
young gin and a coupla piccaninnies pegged out..
They found white men’s tracks —and Yarda’s. And
some more dead dogs. Now they’re out lor ven-
geance. But it’s Yarda they’re after.”
“Why ever?”
“Easy. He’s one of them —and not one of
them, if you get me. He belongs to hostile country.
They mean to get him. Last night he found kaditcha
tracks round his camp. He’s scared stiff; though
I tell him he’s safe enough in here. All the same,
reckon I’ll send him and his family down the line
for a bit and settle with those damn’ city hoboes
meself. The sooner they’re gone the better.” He
swung on her ; his dry voice blazed. If cities make
fellers forget common decency like that, then I m
stopping here.”
“But” This was fantastic! Yet up against
the brilliant sky she saw the hard outline of him, real
as the fence. She gave a little laugh. “Well,” she
said steadily, “it doesn’t matter to us, does it, since
I’m staying with you?”
LONG before dawn Yarda’s woman wakened
Dingo where he slept on the verandah. She’d
got the baby slung gin-fashion on her back and the
kid held in her arms. In the light of a struck match
Dingo saw her face ash-grey. He got out of bed
and went with her, through the low scrub, in the
piercing night-wind.
He was gone some time. As he came back he
could hear the staff-signal ringing in Ward’s place
and see the first thin light of dawn in the east. The
eastbound was on the way towards Wallu, Ward
was struggling into hi§ pants and Mrs. Ward had
got up and lit the primus to make him a cup of tea.
They got a shock to see Dingo* walk in the door,
fetching the woman and kids with him.
“Yarda’s been clubbed where he slept,” he said.
“He’s dead. Give her some tea, will you?”
He didn’t spare time for talk. “Can I wake
Mollie?” he asked, and went towards the bedroom.
“I’m awake,” called Mollie, hearing him. She
came out soft with sleep in her satin kim. She
looked at Dingo’s face and shivered into stiff atten-
tion. She needed no telling what had happened ; she
asked fearfully at once: “What are you going to
do?”
“Settle the score. Where it belongs. I’ll pack
me swag in a second.”
Mollie cried that he couldn’t do it. Two wrongs
didn’t make a right, she said ; the law would deal with
them
“You think so?” said Dingo. “What white man
has swung for an abo. yet? None that I know of.
But I know two who’re going to pay right now for
a man as white as any I’ve ever met.”
“Stop him,” Ward said to the women. “I got to
get over to the office. Have some sense, Dingo.
I’ll be back as soon as I’ve signalled all clear”
Mrs. Ward started to talk. But Mollie just
looked at Dingo and at Yarda’s woman crouched
like a grey ghost in the corner, and she didn’t speak.
Dingo took her wrist. “Well?” he asked.
His grip closed like a trap, hard and remorseless.
And cold, like steel. Mollie couldn’t stop shivering.
She couldn’t make a sound. Dingo dropped her
wrist and shrugged. “I’m going,” he said, “before
it’s light. You can sell the pelts for this woman,”
he told Mrs. Ward.
Mollie found her voice. “What are you going to
do —afterwards ? ”
Dingo smiled at her suddenly. “The desert is
wide. If I’m wanted they can come and get me.”
Mollie looked past him to the open door and
the void of the plain. Soon the engine headlamp
would light the darkness before the dawn, sending
its beam eastwards to the cities. Her fingers smoothed
the soft satin of her kim. She crossed to him, looked
up at his smiling lips and smiled back. In a few
minutes I can get packed up too. We re catching the
train, you and I, Dingo”
She had to shut her eyes against the contempt
flooding his face. When she opened them again,
blind with tears, only Yarda’s woman was left, moan-
ing on the floor.
The Rosery, South Perth. But he was running to
fat, had a gut on him like a poisoned pup.
“ ‘Oh, well,’ I ses, ‘I want that fifty quid.’
“‘You what?’ ses he.
“‘I want that fifty quid,’ I said. ‘Don’t mind tell-
ing you I meant to take it out of your hide when
we came in here —give you the father of a hiding, but
as you can afford to pay p’raps you’d rather’
“ ‘You mean it,’ he ses, goin’ pale.
“‘I mean it, all right,” I told him. ‘l’m jest in
the mood to show you how much I mean it, too.’
“ ‘All right,’ he ses.
“He forked out his pocket book and planked
down the money. Notes, good hard cash. ‘Oh,
well,’ he ses, ‘eighteen years. It’s a long time. Glad
everybody doesn’t come collectin’ their bad debts off
of me like you, Bill.’
“He put out his hand —blowed if he didn’t. We
shook and off he went.” Bill laughed heartily, enjoy-
ing his recollections.
“That’s the way to do it all right, Bill,” Shifty
said. “If I was younger, like you said, and clever with
me fists, I’d be trying the same game with you —to
get that three hundred quid I put up to keep you out
of gaol when you was nabbed for gold-stealing three
or four years ago.”
Bill’s laughter broke out again. “Seein’ you’re
not,” he said, “I might as well tell you you haven’t
got an earthly Of ever seein’ that three hundred,
Shifty.”
“That’s what I reckon,” Shifty replied thought-
fully.
Bill went on talking about what he was going to
do when he got back to Kalgoorlie. If he pulled out
early next morning, he reckoned he’d make Kal. in a
couple of days. Mac jerked himself up from the box
he was sitting on and stalked off to his tent. He was
always the first to turn in. Bill yawned, stretched and
followed suit. Shifty sat on by the fire.
L_J E was still there when Mac and Bill were snoring
1 * heavily. Then he got busy. He was very busy
round the truck and making trips backwards and for-
wards from an old shaft in the bush before at last he
crept into his tent. A smile of bland satisfaction lin-
gered on his weathered old mug when he fell asleep.
It was Bill rampaging round the camp that
wakened him. Bill roaring like a mad bull, cursing
and threatening to do for Mac and Shifty Scott. Mac
got up and went out of his tent to find out what was
the matter. Shifty raised himself reluctantly, his
joints creaking, his head dizzy for lack of sleep.
“What’s the matter?” Bill raged. “You know
damned well what’s the matter. You’ve milked me
tank —stolen me petrol—so as I can’t get away this
morning. I’ve a good mind to lay you both out.
Pretendin’ we was mates.”
“See here, Bill,” Shifty said quietly, “I reckon that
truck belongs to me. You said last night there Wasn’t
an earthly of me ever gettin’ the three hundred quid
off of you, so I’m takin’ the truck in payment.
Not that she’s worth it. But seein’ it’s your only
chance of squarin’ up I’m willin’ to call it a deal.”
“You are, are you?” Bill swung over to dong him.
Mac put his foot out and Bill went sprawling.
“Better not try any funny business, Bill,” Mac
said. “You’re not as young as you were. We’re two
to one and you’re beat. As to dirty tricks —talkin’ of
clearin’ out and leaving Shifty and me to tramp for
water, that’d be hard to beat. Sit down and let’s clear
this up.”
Mac kicked the mulga logs round the fire to-
gether, Shifty and Bill sat down on their boxes.
“Listen,” Mac said, “I haven’t brought you chaps
here and put in six months slogging on this mine for
the fun of the thing. Stay another month, working
the ground we’re on now, and if we don’t strike her
good before the month’s up I’ll be willing to move
on. But I’ve got it in me bones she’s here. And
there’s nothing’ll shift me while I can smell gold.”
“But the truck’s mine, Mac,” Shifty insisted.
“The truck’s yours, Shifty,” Mac said. “I’ll tear
up this document Bill signed last night, and he’ll
share equal with us if he decides to stick to the terms
of the agreement we came out on. If he doesn’t, well,
he can hoof it—with rations for twenty-four hours.”
Bill Langham saw where he stood. He was not
anxious to try tramping across country with only a
waterbag, a tin of dog and a bit of damper between
himself and eternity. Nor would he relish explaining
to men on the track, or in other camps, why lack
Macartney and Shifty Scott had turned him out of
their camp. “You win, Mac,” he said.
Mac tore up the document and threw the pieces
into the fire. Over breakfast it seemed that bygones
were bygones. Mac talked of the sly ways of gold.
“Maybe we’ll find a jeweller’s shop waitin’ for
us this morning,” Bill jeered.
An hour later they were all at work on the shaft
a stone’s-throw from the tents. Shifty had fired the
previous afternoon, and Mac went down first as usual
to have a look round. It was not that day or the
next, not until nearly the end of the month, as a
matter of fact, when he was beginning to look glum
and lose faith in the mine himself, that he came up
with a grin on his face.
“We’ve struck her, boys,” he said. “There she
is, shining in the face, as pretty a show as ever I saw.”
“God A’mighty,” Bill chuckled, “wouldn’t I’ve
been kickin’ meself now —if you hadn’t started col-
lectin’ your bad debts, Shifty?”
The Voice.
I dreamed I wandered lonely in the darkness;
And whimpering rain and wind slunk at my
Like prowling beasts that slavered for my fall.
My hands were ice, and in my heart a starkness
Gathered and grew to chain me to its call,
Till terror rang its urgent warning peals;
And every looming shadow was a shroud.
Then morning pale and proud
Waved darkness from the earth imperiously.
I looked, and saw the sullen mountains bowed
And sluggish ’neath dun parasites of cloud
Like hulls of old ships weary from the sea,
Foul with grey barnacles and small shellfish;
And soon the sun stood poised in gold salute
Above the sentinel crags, while farm-cocks
sounded
In silver arrogance their bugles bright;
And everywhere there was the silken swish
Of winds, and the forlorn and wistful flute
Of blackbirds lost down thickets of wild sloes.
Then pausing in a dewy glade surrounded
By sassafras and myrtle, swift I knelt,
Amazed to see steam rising thin and white;
And thrusting down my hand I softly felt
The earth, and found it warm as though scrub
Had lain in slumber there throughout the night,
Locked fast in dreams, immune in their repose
From the tranced magic of the moon that rose
With unsheathed two-edged sword in the old
battle
Of light and darkness; while the bats went
speeding
Like ebon arrows loosed against the stars.
And, as I knelt, the earth warm ’neath my
hand,
The sunlight finding me through leafy spars
That murmured like green surf on some far
shore,
The watchful silence knowing I was heeding
Spoke in a tongue my heart could understand,
Saying “The hour of courage is awaking.
Stand like my trees, low-bending but not break-
ing;
Be steadfast as my hills, and undismayed
As my brown bracken laughing in yon glade;
The storm will pass as storms have passed
before,
Leaving a strength far greater than of yore.”

There’s Money in the Fight Game Right Enough
HAPPY ENDING
By A.C.HEADLEY.
WRITE a fight story with a happy ending? Sure.
There isn’t any better way of starting
a story than “once upon a time,” and upon
this particular time there lived two boys,
Jimmy and Mack, who got on so well together that
they smoked each other’s cigarettes and exchanged
ties. But, not making enough in the factory, they
cast about for ways of improving their lot. So one
day they called on Joseph Higgins. Joe was a master-
at-arms, or, rather, a master-at-fists. He promptly
installed them in his merry company of the roped
square, and exacted his tithes, only more so —
a twenty-five per cent, cut of the purse. There were
bouts of four rounds and a little later bouts of
six . . .
Joe Higgins was beginning to show them things
about fighting. Jimmy’s confidence was growing
past him. “I told y’, Mack, didn’t I? Look at the
dough we’re knockin’ out. We wouldn’t ’a’ got that
from the factory.”
They were still working in the factory and train-
ing at night. It was Joe Higgins who suggested that
they turn in the factory job. “Y’ can’t do two things
if y’ wanner do ’em proper. I think I can take you
up to the big money. There ain’t no sense crackin’
y’rselves up in a job. You’ve got talent.”
They talked it over.
“Joe’s right,” said Jimmy ; “we can’t do both if
we want to get in the real money. It stands t’
reason. We could take a nice flat an’ do what we
like.”
The sound of it was good. It set Mack thinking
about the rain stain on the dirty ceiling of his room.
The thought of a comfortable flat was something
as smart and clever as Jimmy himself. But the
thought of the security of work was something
stronger. It was something more stable than stand-
ing in a ring and trying to steam the power into
your gloved hands.
“It’s all right,” he said, “about the flat. I’ll be
with you on that, Jimmy, but I ain’t knockin’ off
work. Not workin’ won’t make me fight no better.”
“Y* can get my money for me on Thursd’y,”
said Jimmy. “Tell Snowy I ain’t cornin’ in no more.”
Mack began to think of the trouble there would
be at home when he told them he was leaving.
With Jimmy it was different: he had been living on
his own since he was sixteen. There was another
thing, too, growing out of Mack’s life at home —
Janie. He hadn’t talked much about Janie to Jimmy.
It was just a quiet division of the times when he saw
Jimmy. There were nights when he went to the pic-
tures or a dance with her. Janie was becoming im-
portant in his life, more important than fighting or
Jimmy. The money from fighting was making it
possible to talk about getting married. It was also
one of the reasons he stayed in his job.
Now he told her about going with Jimmy to live
in a flat. “It’s just so we can git away from
places like this,” he said. “It’s getting away from
the old man’s swearing and ma shrieking her head
off about things, and the kids. It’s just like getting
clean.”
She stood close to him in the darkness, and he
could feel the force of her stare. “Gee,” she said,
“we could have some good parties.” She kissed him
suddenly hard on the mouth.
“Sure,” he said, “that’s right, we could ’ave
some parties.” He felt glad about having a girl like
Janie.
TIMMY found the flat and they moved in. Fights
were still going well for both of them. They were
doing six-rounders and an occasional eight. It was
better money and there was still plenty to spare. It
was a new life entirely.
“You were clever when you hit on this fight
game, Jimmy,” Mack told him. “You’ve got y’r
’ead screwed on the right way.”
“It’s better than slavin’ your guts out for four
quid a week. There’s gonna be more, too. I’m
gonna get up to the top. I’m gonna be the champ,
one o' these days.”
“Sure you are,” said Mack. “You got brains.”
Joe Higgins was taking a real interest in them.
In approximately twenty fights each Mack had
dropped two and Jimmy one. They were both being
talked about. Because Jimmy was the leader of the
two boys, Joe talked to Jimmy. “It’s a pity you’re
both fightin’ at the same weight,” he said. “If you
wasn’t I’d ’ave two good fighters.”
Jimmy grinned. “You got two good fighters,
Joe.”
Joe Higgins screwed up his eyes and shook his
head. “I got the two of you matched,” he said, “an’
after that fight I got a prospective champ, and a
prelim, boy.”
Jimmy grinned again. “I’ll beat Mack,” he said,
“if that’s what you mean. But it won’t mean that
Mack’s a back number. You can take it from me
that it’ll be a pretty close fight.”
“You’re wrong,” said Joe Higgins, “it won’t
be no close fight, not if I don’t want it to be. There’s
more ways of winning a fight than fightin’. If you want
to win that fight clear, if you want to be champ., all
y’ gotter do is sign this paper and I’ll take over the
managin’ of you proper. You won’t have to worry
about Mack no more. Like I said, he’ll stay in the
prelims. He won’t get within cooee of another fight
with you.”
Jimmy was suddenly serious. “Listen, Joe. I
couldn’t do that to Mack.”
Joe Higgins tilted his hat on his head. “One
of you will win that fight easy. It won’t matter to
me which. All that matters to me is that I manage
the winner. I could make you lose that fight just as
easy as I could Mack. But there can on’y be one
champ, in each division. What I’m askin’ y’ is
whether you want to be him?” He pulled a pen
out of his pocket and spread the paper on the rub-
bing bench. “It’s big dough, Jimmy.”
the stadium the poster carried the an-
nouncement that the main event was a ten-round
bout between Jimmy Marshall and Mack Gardiner.
The crowd was beginning to move in early;
before half-past seven the cheap seats were almost
full. There was the noise of people talking, and the
air was full of smoke. Near the ring a fat woman

but youngsters must be fed...
Now that Mrs. Johnson has three English evacuees to care for,
she realises, more than ever, that her AGA Cooker is truly a
blessing, for youngsters must be fed. Such work becomes a
pleasure when the Cooker is an AGA.
The AGA Cooker works on the heat storage principle. It is
always ready to boil, braise, fry, grill, toast, stew and even bake
at a moment’s notice. There is no waiting for a hot oven, for
the AGA is always “in.” The AGA burns coke—it requires
only five minutes a day to refuel it and keep it clean.
The AGA has dozens of amazing features such as a wonderful
simmering oven that cooks without attention even overnight;
a roasting oven, in which roasts require
no basting or turning; a positive guarantee
that it will burn not more than £3 worth
of fuel (with coke at 30/- a ton) in a
whole year.

Cooker in operation in our showrooms. Ask

was strumming metallic notes from a battered upright
piano. Back in the dressing-room Jimmy and Mack
were sitting apart. Joe Higgins was taping Jimmy’s
hands. “Listen, Jimmy,” he said, “I’m gonner be
in Mack’s corner for this fight, but you know how
to handle it.”
“Sure,” said Jimmy. “I know how to handle it.”
He knew how to handle it all right. Hadn’t Joe
been schooling him for a week. Wasn’t Joe in Mack’s
corner to make him fight into his hands? Mack
wouldn’t get the chance to know what was happening
to him. “He’ll come out,” Joe had said, “fighting like
I want him to fight, an’ that’ll be the way you want
him to fight.”
Looking across at Mack, Jimmy felt that it
wasn’t right, but it was like Joe had said: there
wasn’t room for two champions, and there was
plenty of room for another prelim, boy. In his heart
was the feeling that he could beat Mack without any
outside assistance.
“It’ll start in the third,” said Joe Higgins, and
he went across to where Mack was sitting on the
rubbing bench. “How y’ feelin’, Mack? Like you
can trounce the ears orf ’im?”
“It’s funny, Joe,” said Mack, “fightin’ Jimmy.
It’s like that night we first come to the gym.”
“All you gotter do,” said Joe, “is trounce the
ears orf ’im. He’s been gettin’ a bit cocky lately. It’ll
do ’im good.” And in the third round he sent him
in on to Jimmy’s lacing fists.
Mack’s mouth was cut when he came back to
his corner at the end of the round. “Jimmy caught
me that time,” he told Joe.
“You’ll catch him this time,” said Joe. “All
you gotter do is what I tell you. You’ll get him.
Watch his right hand and try to move up to him.”
But the lefts were stabbing into his face, and
the hooks thudding in the side of his head. They
were hurting, and he was beginning to feel a little
bit tired. His concentration was still on Jimmy’s
right, and it was hardly being used. That was funny.
It was like Jimmy had worked everything out in his
head. Jimmy had brains. When he came back to
his corner he told Joe about it.
“Sure,” said Joe, “maybe you’re right. Maybe
he’s smarter than I thought. Forget that right this
time and go in after him.” He turned suddenly and
winked across the ring.
At the bell Mack started in to fight. He was
suddenly tight with power. He didn’t see the thing
that happened to him, the packed right that chopped
his head across his shoulders, the right that took the
muscles out of his knees. It was the right that made
him just another prelim, boy.
Back in the dressing-room he shook hands with
Jimmy. “You was too good for me,” he said.
“You’ll beat ’im next time,” said Joe Higgins.
But there wasn’t going to be a next time. Joe was
making sure of that.
Hr HERE was a party at the flat. It was Janie’s
* idea. “It don’t matter,” she said, “who wins. We
can have a celebration. I can bring a few girls. I’ll
have things fixed when you come home.”
It was the first time she had met Jimmy. Now
she stood with the glass of gin in one hand looking
at him.
“He beat me on a knockout,” said Mack.
“It was a lucky punch,” said Jimmy. He liked
the look of Janie with her dark hair and the clear-
ness of her skin. There was the noise of the radio
playing a swing number, a couple was dancing.
Around the room there were a dozen people and
plenty of glasses.
“Listen,” said Janie, “we’ll have a toast for the
victor.” She called one of the smooth-looking men.
“Drinks, Con.”
It was a good party. That was the way they
felt about it in the morning with the taste of it still
in their mouths. Mack had gone to work well before
Jimmy got up, but when he came home they talked
about it.
“We oughter ’ave a few more nights,” said Jimmy.
“Sure,” said Mack.
“That Janie of yours is a nice kid.”
A ND then, abruptly, things were different. Jimmy
was meeting and beating good boys, but Mack
was beginning to slip. In two months, when Jimmy
was crowding his way into a championship match,
Mack was back and fighting in the sixes. He was
winning a few and he was losing more. Joe Higgins
was still telling him how to fight. Jimmy didn’t like
to think about it.
There came the time when Mack quit. “Listen,
Jimmy,” he said, “I’m getting the noises in the head.
It’s time I got out. I’ve still a job, and I don’t want
to finish in the silly house. I gotter think of Janie.
I got a few quid stowed away in the bank. We
could get married.”
“Yair,” said Jimmy; “it ain’t no good stayin’
in when it gets you that way.”
“I can’t afford to stay here no more,” said Mack.
“I’m goin’ back home.”
He told Janie. It was funny the way she took
it, talking about the money.
“We can get married,” he said; “and after all
I can’t go on fightin’ all me life.”
“I’ve got to think about it,” she said.
After that he didn’t have a girl, and it was funny
thinking of Janie as being Jimmy’s girl. It was the
reason he didn’t go to see Jimmy any more. Being
near Jimmy and thinking of Janie made him feel
shy and embarrassed. You couldn’t blame her for
wanting to do the best for herself. Mack knew
what it meant to live in a room where the ceiling
was shaded with dirt. He didn’t blame her for want-
ing to get away from the threat of it. Jimmy had
brains. It wasn’t going to be long before Jimmy
was the champion.
Mack went to the title fight, sitting in the bleachers.
It was a good fight, but after the eighth round he
could see that Jimmy had it won. Jimmy had brains.
After that there was plenty of paper talk about him.
He defended his title and kept defending it. Mack
was glad, because it meant the big money. The
papers were full of him, and there was half a column
on the day he married Janie.
There was a day five years later when Mack met
Jimmy and it wasn’t Jimmy. His face was flat and
his nose buckled, and there was a jab of meat for
his ear. He didn’t recognise Mack, and it was a long
time before he knew who it was. His clothes were
shabby and stained, and you could see him trying
to put the cogs of his mind into the little grooves.
“Janie?” said Mack.
“I ain’t seen her for a long time,” he said slowly.
“She’s knockin’ around with someone.”
It was a long time before Mack spoke. “They
made me foreman,” he said.
“Any chance of a job?” Jimmy said.
MAYBE there are no moated castles, but there’s a
couple of houses and people paying rent. Maybe
there’s no gallant steed, but there’s a new car, and
the feller who’s got it found it in the fighting game.
He’ll make plenty more, and at the end he won’t be
punch-silly. He’s made the dough and he’s still
making it. His nose isn’t buckled, and it doesn’t
take him five minutes to answer a simple question.
He’s got brains. The boys call him Joe, and give
him twenty-five per cent, of the purse. Joe’s happy,
but there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the ending.
There are too many kids who want to “take up”
fighting. Too many kids like Jimmy and Mack.


A Man of the Bush
ROAD TO PROGRESS
By - OLAF RUHEN.
THE compass of Jake’s life was bounded tight by
a road. It marked, as arbitrarily as they could
be marked, the separate and widening phases
of his existence. And yet he did not follow the
road which led from the town, through the bush, along
the coast and back by way of the highway to the
city. He was never to know it all.
The road, to Jake, was three roads. First it was
the clay road, puffing its velvet dust up through his
toes in the summertime, squelching in fantastic pat-
terns in the winter. Then it was a metal road, friendly
to Jake still, but a road more cosmopolitan. From a
long way off it gave warning of the approach of
strangers, yet it bore them faithfully. Lastly came
the tarred macadam, and it was this that cut deepest
into Jake’s life so that that pari of it which went
before the tarred macadam bore no resemblance at
all to what came after. But Jake liked the tar-sealed
road, and sought company there in that part of his
life —a company of watching speeding cars, of listen-
ing to the low whine that began in the next valley
and finished at the top of his hill, of laughing at the
halted progress of the little wild things.
T AKE was seven when McMasters took up the first
land in the valley and opened up the track so
that it gave clearance to his wagon. And before Jake
was nine there were three men who used the road
regularly. Near the swampy places in the valleys the
bush was cut right back where they had taken it to
build up a corduroy crossing. On the steep slope it
had been cut back now and then when the wagons
wanted an angle pull. And every time the teams
passed one another there was another sapling gone,
another green grove of ferns lying flat. Once or twice
a year a working bee added improvements.
Jake had seen the road and the men working on
it many times when he was nine. They had not seen
him, although they had talked to his father; his
mother had died before he could know her. Jake was
a wild thing. His ears pricked like a terrier’s when he
heard a snapping branch. He could catch the weka
and the cacaw as expertly as any Maori, and his
father, when he knew this, put away his rifle and did
not use it any more. Trapping he kept up, for the
’possums provided him with tobacco and periodic
spells on the ran-tan. Jake provided the provender.
He could manage the open whaleboat they kept on
the slip by the time the road came, though his father
had to be on hand when he returned to winch it high
above the highest tide and lash it down. He could
sling the hauling gear to the end of the sapling that
made a boom out over the low cliff by the blowhole,
and work the big Kaikoura pot for its haul of
scrabbling blue crayfish. He was a man in the bush,
but he still feared his own kind.
The clay road made the first intersection across
the way of his life. It brought the people in the next
valley, and when he was nine it brought the school. He
was still shy and wild, and he had a great deal of
trouble, but he learned to spell out w*ords and write his
name. He was quite clever at the school, and would
have learned much, except that he liked better the
learning in the bush by himself. But his schooling was
adequate. In after years he could read a newspaper
or a book, and at times, when there was someone to
watch him, he did, but it was always a task.
Jake was twenty-five when the contractors brought
the metalling of the road to the hill above the valley.
He was a strong, husky youth in tattered store-bought
clothes, and the foreman offered him a job, but he
refused. While the gang was there, he visited the road
almost daily, although he still lived with his father
half a mile back in the bush at the place where the
stream broke the low cliff beyond the blowhole.
It was on the road he met Mary, whom he mar-
ried very shortly afterwards. Her father, who was on
the gang, insisted on it, although Mary, who was thirty-
five, was old enough to have a say of her own. She
was an ungainly fat, but her lackadaisical habits,
rather than her figure, probably prevented her mar-
riage earlier. Jake married her, and took everything
complacently, even to the seven children which were
all that she had time to produce. Further, he fathered
the family efficiently, although he never worked
at any job, bar fishing and ’possum-trapping.
His father left him when he brought his bride
home, and Jake never saw him again. It was in the
early part of this period that the Mannering struck
on the end of the point in a heavy fog. A sea was
running that put her inshore. The rock split her to her
keel, and she started to break amidships. She was
abandoned in the thick wet blanket of night, and the
boats landed all her complement safely on the beach
that fringed the settled valley. All the settlers in the
district were there in the early morning to see the
damage, and so were the revenue men. By that time
both halves had slipped back into deep water and
only her horizontal stem-post broke the surface.
But before the dawn Jake’s whaleboat had made
the short trip many times. Thereafter his children
were prettily clothed, though all the girls’ dresses, all
the boys’ shirts were made of cloth that boasted one
of three patterns. Jake’s hut grew to four rooms and
was carpeted throughout. The carpet was a red
runner with a blue pattern. When a piece wore badly
it was replaced. And though there were few kitchen
chairs, there were little water-kegs for the children
to sit on, and Mary wore one shade of pink silk
stockings for the next ten years.
D Y and large, Jake managed to get by. Then they
‘' macadamised the road and tarred it over. This
was a part only of a manifestation that had been get-
ting ever more clear at the time, but the tar-sealing
coincided with the change in Jake’s life. For it was
exactly then that he came in contact with real city
men, not just policemen or rangers or Customs men.
V. V. White, Stock Exchange member, and chair-
man of one of the many committees pertaining to the
Acclimatisation Society, combined a certain skill in
fly-casting with an appreciation of the showier results
of rock-fishing. Prospecting near the top of the cliff
with a would-be initiate, he eyed in envy the long flat
shelf at its foot. The two of them wasted a good
half-hour watching the vantage point.
“Someone’s down there —look!” announced Ran-
some, and a figure moved from the patch of sun
towards the water. Ransome was the initiate and his
specialty lay in the Game Committee’s side of
“Soons 'e sees me coomin' 'e scootles ’ isself !”
Acclimatisation activities. The figure moved down to
the water where a long deep crevasse in the rock
surged in a living tangle of kelp and white foam,
Straight into the maelstrom at its highest point it
moved ; then, as the tangle receded, it bent quickly and
threw a round, dark object on to the rock behind it.
It was back on the rock before the next lift, but the
actions were repeated half a dozen times. Then the
man picked up the objects he had retrieved, and,
thrusting them into his shirt, began to climb the cliff,
Jake spotted the strangers as he came over the
top, and looked at them incuriously, waiting for them
to make the first move.
“Uh, nice day,” nodded Mr. White brightly, and
Jake assented wordlessly.
“If you don’t mind my asking, what was that you
were getting?”
“Pauas,” said Jake, and produced one.
“Oh, yes, of course. They’re good bait.”
“Good soup,” said Jake.
Mr. White talked himself as far as Jake’s cabin.
Mr. Ransome tailed along. It was Mary who asked
them to wait and try the paua soup.
They stayed for dinner. Grilled salmon followed
the creamy paua soup.
“Salmon!” exclaimed Mr. White, and his brow
furrowed as he remembered the seine net hanging on
the stand outside.
“Canary,” nodded Jake. “Nice bit of fish.”
Mr. Ransome grinned, and looked under his lids
at Mr. White, who took no notice.
There was a third course. Four birds came out
of the camp oven. They had a tang, those birds,
difficult to identify.
“Pigeons, aren’t they?” asked Mr. White.
Jake said “No” and kicked one of the kids under
the table. The girl looked aggrieved, considering
that she had a perfect right to laugh at a man who
didn’t know pigeon from cacaw.
Before they left, the strangers made arrangements
to come early in the morning. Jake promised to find
them some pigs, and later to introduce them to some
rock-fishing. And in appreciation of having found
something that so nearly resembled “the real thing,”
and in anticipation of a day’s real sport, the two of
them, with another acquaintance, turned up not long
after dawn on the following morning.
“Daddy’s not back from his traps,” piped the
same little girl that had laughed.
“He’s a trapper, is he? Does he catch a lot of
rabbits?” Mr. White was humoring the juvenile mind.
“No,” said the little girl, and hung her head,
tracing a semicircle in the dust with her toe. All
her manner showed that she resented being made fun
of in that ridiculous way.
“There aren’t any rabbits in this coastal bush,”
contributed the newcomer, Mr. Wilkin.
The tot flashed him a look of gratitude. “No,”
she said, “they’re ’possums.”
A heavy arm swept her aside, and she landed by
the cabin with a surprised look in her eyes. Mary
was standing on the doorstep smiling at the strangers.
It was a close season for opossums.
As if that were not enough, Jake, out of sheer
kindness of heart, called up a weka later on so that
Mr. Wilkin might see it. A blade of grass between
his lips, he squatted a little apart from the others,
making a cheeping, as of half a dozen barnyard
chickens. A weka came stepping cautiously from the
darkness of the bush. Five minutes later there were
three quite close to Jake. He swept up the nearest
and put it under his coat in one action. The other two
looked surprised and wandered away, unhastily and
unafraid. Jake showed his quarry to Mr. Wilkin, then
let it go, a little lingeringly. Fired by the reception, he
called a cacaw to a near-by branch. The party was
suitably impressed.
Suddenly Mr. Ransome stopped, fired by a dread-
ful conviction. “Can you call ducks?” he asked,
“Sure,” said Jake and led on.
After a moment Mr. Ransome followed the others
to an ultimate success.

THERMOPYLAE SPARTA LEONIDAS
Names that have rung down the centuries for nigh on
2500 years. For they stand for the heroic sacrifice of
Life in defence of the deathless ideal of Freedom . . .
Greece, the centre of Civilisation for the known world, was in
danger of invasion at the hands of the wealthy, pleasure-loving
Persians. To the invading horde of 330,000 Leonidas opposed
a mere handful —not more than 1400 Spartan, Thespian, Iheban
warriors in the final stage —but it was not until his flank had
been turned through treachery and every member of his force
killed that the Persians prevailed. Still, the heroic action of
Thermopylae provided inspiration for the series of naval and
military operations that led finally to the freeing of Greece.
Today Greece is again valiantly fighting the battle of Freedom
for the civilised world. By sheer personal gallantry her soldiers
have hurled the invaders beyond her borders. But today personal
valor is not the only requisite of a warrior people. Modern
warfare is mechanised, and mechanical equipment calls for huge expenditure ... The people of Greece number only 7,000,000
one-tenth the population of the attacking enemy. To maintain her gains, to preserve the Eastern Mediterranean for Britain, to
offset the enemy thrust against Suez, Greece must have Monetary aid. Every Greek in Austialia, every Britisher
name, who can afford to give financial assistance to Greece should do so. Every day counts. Send YOUR contribution NOW!

family—living on game year in and year out. They
discussed ways and means, and found them. They
took measures that Jake found harder and harder
to intercept. They argued with him, and he found it
easier to listen. They had their rangers concentrate
on the place, and the local policeman put himself
right with everybody when he confiscated Jake’s hoard
of unregistered skins. Finally, they had the family
shifted holus-bolus* to town. Two of the girls started
factory work almost immediately. Mr. Ransome
found Jake a job as nightwatchman.
Jake never wanted to go back. Mr. Ransome
tells him now that the game is gone, the creek is fished
out. Mary has a gas stove instead of a camp oven. The
kids go to the pictures. And all the roads are tar-sealed
and the footpath is easy walking for Jake’s light shoes.
Some Helpful Hints
By LES ROBINSON.
WET weather, even though they may not be
obliged to plootch about in it, seems to
depress some people, to afflict them with
lethargy, to slow down their mental processes.
One way of preventing yourself, if temperamental at
all, from being wholly dominated or submerged by
such troubles is to force yourself, whether it needs
an almost superhuman effort or not, to move about,
to find something to do. Don’t sit about twiddling
your thumbs or fiddling with string ; prevent yourself
sternly and forcibly, if necessary, from lying down
and staring blankly at the ceiling or counting the
fues on it. Don’t mooch about drumming idly on
the window-panes or adding to your inherent gloom
by staring out of them at the drenched, dripping and
sodden landscape. Cursing the weather is inadvisable,
too. I have always noticed myself that the more you
do so the more, just to get even with you, no doubt,
it keeps on steadily getting worse and worse. Some-
how or other, for reasons unknown to me, the weather,
ever since I ve known it, has always been like that.
You are not, after all, wet through yourself, per-
haps not very damp even, although the salt, your fish-
ing trousers, bacon, tobacco and matches may be.
Many a soldier on the battlefield, many a sailor on
the high seas, many a prisoner condemned to death
or serving a life-sentence would much rather be where
you are now than where they are themselves. Remind
yourself from time to time that it is what they do
with their leisure which makes the rather vast and
cheerless difference between the successful in life, or
affluent, and the utterly futile and/or indigent who are
getting nowhere in particular. Nor should you forget
that Henrys Ford, Morgan and James ; Dicks Turpin
and Whittington ; Roberts Bruce, Burns and Le Diable ;
Stanleys Baldwin and Bruce ; Bens Boyd, Hall and
Franklin ; Ajax, Ethelred the Unready, Samuel Plim-
soll, or any other celebrity, real or fictitious, upon
whom you may, at different times, have modelled
yourself, never for one moment, presumably, allowed
themselves to be daunted or deterred, much less domi-
nated, by the elements.
It may be supposed you are not one of those
somewhat rare, doubtless worthy, restless as a rule and
indefatigable mortals who spend their “leisure” doing
accounts, mending things or renovating their domi-
ciles. How then, you ask, are you to so occupy your-
self that the drenched hours go streaming rapidly by
instead of lagging soppingly and drearily? I have
always found myself that turning out one’s drawers,
trunks, boxes, cupboards and endeavoring to put one’s
multifarious possessions (mere encumbrances most of
mine) in some sort of order is as good a way as any
of palliating wet-day boredom and of helping to ward
off, or at least to mitigate, attacks of the blues. Be
wary, though, while rummaging, because insects and
reptiles of various kinds, some living permanently
among your belongings, despite camphor or moth-
balls, others just waiting among them until the rain
is over, are very likely indeed to be encountered, dis-
turbed and, therefore, infuriated by you.
If the state your belongings get into at all re-
sembles the tangled condition prevalent, to a riotous
extent that rarely if ever subsides, among mine, you
will not, I can assure you, find the task of sorting
them out either short or devoid of fatigue. What
surprises, pleasant and otherwise, await you! How
did you ever come to accumulate such an utterly use-
less conglomeration of odds and ends? Your habit
of picking things up in the mistaken idea that they
might come in handy some day is, undoubtedly, partly
responsible for the continually increasing nuisance
these bulging drawers, boxes and cupboards are to
you. But only partly. You lose one cuff-link, for
instance, and instead of throwing the other away you
keep it in the futile hope that the lost one will turn up
sooner or later. It is the same with bed- or doorknobs,
odd locks and keys, lids, stoppers, corks, fittings of one
sort and another but no longer connected with any-
thing they were originally intended to fit. Bits of this
and that. If your collection is as large and varied as
mine you no longer, probably, have the faintest idea
whether these oddments of which it is so largely com-
posed once formed portion of electric-irons or
generators, sausage or milking machines, stoves, band
instruments, locomotives, refrigerators or traction-
engines.
Mementoes such as marbles, ninepins, golf, tennis,
cricket or ping-pong balls, boathooks, rowlocks,
stirrups, pedals, hooks, lines, sinkers, reels, floats, of
all the different indoor and outdoor sports in which
you once took an active or merely passive interest, help
a whole lot to amplify the disorder. Old ties, straps,
chains, bootlaces, braces, lengths of wire, pieces of
rope and string are unequalled, you cannot fail to
notice either, for creating confusion complicated by
entanglement.
I once knew a man who collected the larger kinds
of junk such as portions of motor vehicles, funnels,
spouting, drain-pipes, gratings, gates, stoves, vats,
boilers and rusty old iron tanks. He kept it all in an
orchard attached to his house. Some of it reached up
into the branches of the trees and there were no
vacant spaces left among them anywhere, so that, of
course, any sort of tillage was impossible, which,
however, as he was by no means energetic, he prob-
ably regarded as an advantage. The heaped-up junk
also, of course, was a hindrance to fruit thieves.
You prick your fingers. Y6u become, no doubt,
exasperated. You are smothered in dust which they
say is deleterious. It begins to get dark always long
before your strenuous endeavors appear to have had
the slightest effect. You will not, however, mind in
the least, for the task you set yourself seems to involve
so much bending about and crawling to and fro on
hands and knees that (experientia docet ) weariness,
slightly tinged possibly with pessimism, and back-
ache will, by this time, have assailed you. Although
it may be raining harder than ever you will no longer
care a hang either. The appetite you have acquired
will almost empty the larder, and, furthermore, you
will be able to console yourself for once, when going
to bed, with the reflection that something attempted
if not actually done has earned the large and blissful
amount of repose which you are about to enjoy
whether it has been earned or not.

THE /DEAL SWEET FOR BEACH PAYS

MM-O-6
SEA GLORY
By WILL LAWSON.
THE gale which raged in the early days of April
of the year 1924 swept in over a rolling wilder-
ness of waters to thrash and thunder on the
rocky coasts from Gabo to Smoky Cape. The
fierce seas smashed on black cliffs and roared on
deserted beaches. A large freighter, the Honolulu
Maru, Captain Karnataka in command, had loaded
zinc concentrates at Risdon and was steaming north-
ward out of Bass Strait when the gale caught her by
the tail and sent her yawing and staggering north-
wards, till her cargo shifted.
Her captain’s hope was to reach Jervis Bay, eighty
miles south of Sydney, where there was a deep
entrance leading between high rugged cliffs. On a
course some twenty miles offshore, the trouble lay in
edging the ship towards the port, for she rolled so
dangerously that at any moment she might capsize.
Soon after midnight on April 4, when the gale
screamed at its worst, the SOS was sent out.
Several merchantmen near at hand heard the
call, and the nearest, the steamer Canberra, which was
bowling northwards before the gale, swung in her
track and began to fight her way back to the Honolulu
Maru. The Special Service Squadron, headed by the
Hood and Renown, was coming northwards, too. The
cruiser Dauntless was detached to race to the aid of
the Jap. In the early dawn she came up with the dis-
abled freighter, but found the seas so high she could
do no more than stand by. After a time, the Daunt-
less was replaced by the Dragon, which steamed round
and round the Honolulu Maru, at a distance of half
a mile, ready to render aid should the ship turn over.
But there was no hope of getting a line on board
and towing the ship to safety.
In Sydney the Navigation Department roused the
tugs. Captain Larsen, of the Champion, answered
laconically: “All right. Get her ready. We’ll go.”
And that forenoon, while telephone wires
screamed and swung in the windy streets, and the
seas pounded even the quiet beaches inside the harbor,
the Champion went, gliding down the harbor, where
ferry-boats scuttled about with flying skirts and smoke
streaming like wind-blown hair. In the screaming of
wind and lashing and roaring of seas, the steady
rumble of her engines could be heard only at intervals
as she turned outside. Into the gale, now on her head,
now standing on her tail, she made a steady three
knots with all her power.
At noon she came up with the stricken ship, and
the question arose how she would do what the smart-
est cruisers in the Navy could not do —get a line on to
the Honolulu Maru.
Since her SOS had gone out the ship had worked
her way landwards. Now she was six miles offshore.
Darkness fell before the Champion could get close to
the steamer, swinging her stern dangerously near to
the rolling hull. The line flew out, with its leaden
weight to carry it, fell on the salt-rimed forecastle-
head of the freighter and was pounced on by half a
dozen seamen. They swiftly tied it to the bight of
a hawser and sent it back to the tug, where the hawser
was made fast to the bitts of the towing horse amid-
ships. Then the Champion began the tow into Jervis
Bay. There she left her and turned about to steam
straight back to Sydney.
Sometimes the calm, considered syllables of
legal phraseology can tell such an epic best. Justice
Street finished the story in the Admiralty Court:
“The Champion’s task was rendered more difficult by
the fact that it was carried on in the dark. The skilful
seamanship of her master and the bravery of all on
board are deserving of ungrudging recognition and of
the highest commendation. The tug left port in tem-
pestuous weather for the sole purpose of rendering
assistance to the Honolulu Maru. For upwards of
twenty-four hours she fought her way against wind
and sea before she reached the distressed vessel.
Manifestly the case is one for a large and liberal
reward.”
Six thousand pounds was the amount awarded, of
which £4OOO went to the owners of the tug, £7OO to
the master, £5O to the mate and £25 each —a special
award —to seamen Knowles and Wright, who handled
the lines, risking death in doing so. Of these two men
the Judge remarked that “they took additional risks.”
And £l2OO was divided among all hands but the
master.
“But for the timely aid given by the Champion,”
ended the Judge’s comment, “there is little doubt that
the Honolulu Maru would have been cast ashore and
there would probably have been serious loss of life,
even if all on board had not perished.”
“Look, Mary, that's modesty for you .”

WESTERN BRANCH OF NATIONAL BANK
Collins and William Streets, Melbourne.
As a country of opportunities Australia has justified
itself, evidenced by comparing the rural districts and
cities of today with their counterparts of as short a
term as twenty years ago.
Plentiful as the opportunities have been, they are as
nothing compared to those of the future. One has
only to think of the war-torn countries overseas to
realise that their peoples will be more looking towards
this country, both as a haven of manufacture and as a
country from which much-needed supplies may be
purchased. This prospective activity means oppor-
tunity for business and all employed in business.
The National Bank has lived and worked in the
community for 80 years. It has always associated
itself with the progress achieved and is proud of the
practical assistance which it has been privileged to give.
The Bank looks forward to the fruitful years ahead,
ready to take a prominent part in the fulfilment of
Australia’s highest hopes of future development.

A Steadfast Character
BY THE COMPASS
By JAMES HACKSTON.
VOU’D have thought my
father had brought home
something of great value—
some rare and precious
find. He took it out of his
pocket with a smile that ran from ear to ear, like a boy
with a new knife; then he put it on the table and
stood back for us all to admire it.
“A compass,” said my mother indifferently.
‘See the needle,” he said, pointing proudly. “It
always points to the magnetic north, my sonny.” I
noticed that he addressed me ; that meant that my
mother was neither interested nor enthusiastic enough
for him.
I gazed at the trembling little needle.
“This,” he said dramatically, “is the compass
that guides the mariner at sea and helps the wan-
derer in the wild. It never fails man, and, wherever
he is, guides him safely on his way.”
“And what are you going to do with it?” my
mother asked.
A wave of pain passed over his features, as if my
mother’s lack of understanding, or lack of apprecia-
tion, of what he was going to do with such a prize was
past belief. But he soon threw off the dampening
effect of her remark. “Do with it, mother! Why, this
precious little thing is going to be a great help to me.
It’s going to save me miles of footslogging.”
“Oh,” she said.
“Well, that’s something, isn’t it?”
“I suppose so.”
“Why, I won’t have to stick to the roads when
I have to go on my long trips. I will be able to find
my way across country.” He grew hopeful, enthu-
siastic. “Be able to take off through trackless bush.
Travelling that way will save me many miles, and” —
he looked at her —“boot leather, too. And that will
be worth something, won’t it?”
course we all knew that father, now he’d come
by a compass, would go in search of distant tail-
ings or reefs in the wildest spots so that he could
make for his destination by the compass. We knew
that he would desert his “find” up on One Stump Hill
—he knew his way there blindfolded —and that his
first trip would have to be a big one, a long journey
over new country, the more inaccessible the better.
“Travelled by the compass!” There was an import-
ance about it that suited him, quite apart from finding
any gold.
He soon had a place in his mind’s eye where there
should be a reef.
“We will travel north,” he said, “and if we keep
strictly to the compass we should strike a section of
the country where I have heard a find was once made,
and where I have every belief there is still gold.” He
looked warningly at the whole family as if they were
to do the trip, too. “It’s going to be rough going,
though ; I promise you that. But, if I am any judge
of distance, I should say we’ll save God knows how
many miles by cutting out the old roads and side-
tracks.”
“What does that mean?” my mother asked.
“Going in a straight line,” he said impressively,
“and not deviating, whatever comes.”
“Over gorges and mountain torrents,” said my
mother.
“Now then, mother; don’t be facetious. It
means that we won’t have to dodge mountains through
being frightened of getting bushed.”
“When do we start?” she asked.
My father and I set off very early one morning
—with the compass. And he was so precise and con-
scientious during our journey that I doubt if we went
off the needle by a hair’s breadth. It was a wonder
he did not wear out his vest pocket, so many times
did he take the compass out to inspect it, to verify
the way we were “travelling.” And then when we’d
sit down on a log for a rest he’d take it out again
and rest it on his open palm and just look at it.
We did not come across any mountain torrents as
my mother had suggested, but we certainly came across
a gorge or two. The needle not only knew where the
north was, but also discovered the rockiest, roughest
and most inhospitable bush for our feet to manoeuvre.
Funny thing about the needle was that it seemed to
take a dislike to trees when the sun was at its hottest,
for then it would start pointing in the direction of
barren wastes. Then after that it would tire of flat
stages and point straight to gaunt rocky eminences,
where we had to climb like mountain goats.
“We haven’t swerved off our track,” he said ;
“not an inch.”
“Have we saved many miles yet, where we’re
going?” I asked.
Oh, we must have —travelling by the compass.”
I nodded.
“We’re getting into the wild country now, all
right, ’ he said gleefully, as if he had achieved some-
thing. “And no getting bushed,
either.”
Then we came to one of
those long fences which seem to
run from where you are to the
ends of the earth, the tops of the posts running away
in perspective and merging into one grey line. On the
other side of this fence we struck one of those obstacles
that you sometimes meet when you travel honestly by
the compass. The steadfast needle was no respecter of
man or beast. It had headed straight for the sturdiest,
roughest, most larrikin-looking mob of wild cattle you
have ever seen. They’d smelt us miles off, and their
eyes had got bloodshot waiting for us. Big fellows they
were, with silver streamers flying from their nostrils.
They stood and stared at us, their battalion of horns
standing up like fat swords. They were in a direct
line between the compass and its objective.
“We’ll have to go round them,” I suggested hope-
fully.
My father drew himself up. “Well, that all
depends on the needle ; we can’t go out of our way.
If they’re in our path, to hell with them! We go
through them!”
“Yes,” I replied meekly.
He took out the compass. “The needle’s pointing
straight at that big white fellow.” The big white fellow
had horns on him like a Melville Island buffalo, and
the needle must have picked him out as the leader.
“We’ll, my sonny, it’s no use travelling by the com-
pass if one has to make wide detours. Might as well
go by the roads as do that.”
“Yes,” I said, looking at the cattle as they began
to come slowly forward, as if fully determined to
keep us on our own side of the fence.
“Come on,” said my father; “they’re harmless.
Let us drive them off.”
Gingerly, he got through the fence, and I did the
same. The big white fellow raised his head, and his
horns seemed to stand out like tree-trunks against the
sky. “Tough-looking proposition, isn’t he? Evidently
their leader.” He made a bit of a rush at them —only a
few yards—and said “Shoo!” like my mother when
she wanted to get the fowls out of the kitchen.
The cattle didn’t understand fowl talk, and stood
stock-still. Then he picked up a stick, ran in a few
yards and heaved it at them. There was a rustle
among the horns, and the battalion withdrew a few
yards, except the big white steer. He shook his head
and flew a bigger silver streamer.
“Nasty fellow, that one,” my father complained.
He threw up his arms, waved them like a windmill and

ran forward a yard, and the enemy withdrew the yard
my father had advanced. Then the big fellow began
to put heart into his followers by advancing on our
right flank. My father went back to the fence then,
and they followed suit, and got back the ground they
had lost.
“Now we’ll change our tactics,” he said. “We’ll
take our coats off and run in and wave them at them.”
We put this into operation, the enemy retiring in
a mad rush. Then we halted, and they halted. And
so we all stood still again.
“Well,” he said, “we can’t stand here all day,
blast them! But if we advance any more we’ll be get-
ting away from the fence, don’t forget; and if that
big white fellow comes at us, as he might, we may not
be able to get back to it in time.” He was beginning
to get cross, too, about wasting time. We had left
our home at dawn, and like a general he had worked
out the time we would take for each mile, how long
it would take us to get to our destination, how long
we would be able to put in seeing about the “reef,”
how long to return, and the hour we should arrive
back home. Eight o’clock at the latest.
“I’ll tell you what we’ll do. We’ll kick up a hell
of a row and make a rush for the cover of those rocks.
But be prepared to get back to the fence if they come
at us.”
"Yes,” I said limply.
He looked at the sun. “But perhaps we’d better
have our snack first. Better on a full stomach, eh?”
He looked at the enemy. “Won’t have it here though ;
we’ll sneak quietly back to the fence. Then they
might drift away while we’re having it.”
We stole back, and as we did so they stole after
us, step by step, stop by stop, until they were back
in their first strong position. We had our snack.
SOME distance before us the flat country changed
to a ridge of giant boulders, and it was these we
were to make for. We did ; and the still bush awoke
to our battle cries. The enemy fell back in wild dis-
order ; then the big fellow wheeled, and brought half
of his mob round in a half-circle, leaving the rest of
them in front of us. We were still running, when my
father saw himself being sandwiched in between the
foe’s front and back lines.
“ Remember, nurse, he's got to be kept in bed.
“He’s going to cut us off from the fence!” he
yelled. “Quick! Back to the fence!” We streaked
for our lives, the enemy’s front line retreating as we
ran back, their back line coming after us. We fell
through the fence. Wild silver streamers now flew
from every enemy nostril. .
“They won’t drift away,” he said ruefully. 1
should have kept on. But I’ll beat them.
“How?” . ,
“We’ll go quietly ; they seem to retire better that
way. Come on!”
We advanced slowly, yard by yard, until we got
to within fifty yards of the rocks, when we made a
bolt for it and reached cover. Then we climbed up
the rocky eminence and sat there.
“Well, so far so good,” he said, blowing hard.
“We’ll rest awhile and then push on.” After a while
he said, “Do you know, I think we’ve been longer
than I thought. The shadows are stretching, aren’t
they? We’ll have to get a move on if we’re to look
into that reef before we make tracks home again.
He looked at the shadows. “Won’t be able to do as
much as I thought.”
“How far is it?” I asked.
“Oh, only a few miles now. Just enough time
to do it.” He put his hand to his vest pocket. “Good
God! I’ve lost the compass!” We both stood up.
Down below the enemy was still looking us over.
“Must have lost it in the skirmish ; and I’ll bet it’s
down there among them.” He wiped his forehead.
“Lie low for a while so they can’t see us, and then
maybe they’ll drift away. Can’t look for it with them
around.”
We retired out of sight and sat down again ; and
while we waited the shadows grew longer. After
some time the enemy withdrew into a gully on our
left; then we began to look for the compass.
My father, as usual, began the business systemati-
cally, and went back over the ground which he said
we had been over. Then he discovered that it was
not the ground ; that we were twenty yards off the
trail —he’d suddenly recognised the fence post from
where we’d started. But this route brought no com-
pass to light, either. So he discovered that it was the
post a little farther along ; the one with the notch on
it—he remembered it. But all the posts then seemed
to have the same notch, so we discarded the posts
and took our bearings from the rocky eminence. We
crossed the battlefield and came back again, making
little detours, excursions and expeditions (allowable in
this instance), but the compass still remained hidden.
And all this while the shadows began to stretch out
longer arms from the sun.
I was then sent to make reconnaissances farther
afield, and we were still seeking when the ranges began

On the Coal River
OUT OF THE
PAST
THE BREAKWATER.
J.H.M. ABBOTT.
I HEARD the story from “old Thomas Garvice”
one Sunday morning when we went for a walk
along the breakwater that joins the islet of Nobby’s
—the old Coal Island —to the mainland, and helps
form the narrow seaward gateway of the very costly
harbor which has been dredged and walled and engi-
neered about the mouth of the Hunter. He was then
a rosy-cheeked youngster of 75, with a bright eye, a
steady hand, a firm and almost “springy” gait, and an
astonishingly clear and accurate remembrance of all
that he had observed from youth to what, in his case,
appeared to be merely middle-age.
We talked of the wreck of the Cawarra, and
when we came to the foot of the grassy slope that leads
up to the lighthouse and signal station on top of the
isolated lump of rock which is Nobby’s and turned to
look back along the broad, solid causeway across
which we had just passed my friend pointed out that
it was hereabout that the Cawarra went to pieces. “Up
against this breakwater the poor battered bodies were
dashed and hurled by the waves. Very sad, it was,
while it lasted —very lamentable. I remember it all so
vividly. But there had been tragedy enough in the
piling up of these stones to make a mere wreck, with
its incidental loss of life, almost a commonplace. Yet
by the time of the Cawarra gale, in the ’sixties, it had
been quite forgotten. Or very nearly forgotten. A
few rugged old men still lived here —and up at Port
Macquarie, or in the gaols at Darlinghurst and Parra-
matta and Berrima —who had slaved in Major Mor-
rissett’s gangs of prisoners when this sea-wall was built.
They remembered. Hardly anyone else gave a thought
to the sweat and agony, the drownings and maimings
and floggings, that were the payment of its builders.
“You know, it was all originally made by man-
power, this first breakwater —and by the power of the
cat-o’-nine-tails. The convicts kept on piling up
broken rock into the sea until the thing was completed
—shoving and hauling it out in little carts to which
men were harnessed like beasts until the gap between
the shore and the island had been bridged Gales
often swe Pt awa y th L e labor ot months but they were
kept at Jt - Even when the wall was finished, it was
™ ore than once breached by t e lg seas ro ing in
| rom out yonder. When list remem er 1, i was
an embankment of loose stones o a s apes an
sizes ’ ar J d n °t very wi e; a tis acing o masonry
came anerwaras.
I asked him whether he had ever come across any
of the people who had been engaged in the construe-
tion of the section begun by Major Morrissett. He
podded his head reminiscently. Oh, yes—several of
them. One particularly an old fellow they used to
ca ll Cedar Billy. My father often told his story.
, . .
I HEY called him Billy because of his com-
plexion, and because when he got his free pardon
he went cedar-getting up on the Williams River and
the Paterson. When I knew him, of course, he was a
ver Y °l d man wed over eighty, I think and lived in
a little humpy up on Shepherd s Hill, on the bit of
money he’d made in the timber trade.
“ ‘ Ah , Tommy,’ he used to say to me, ‘your daddy
was a good man If all of them that was over us poor
lags had been like him, there wou dn t ha been half
the floggings and hangings and bloody murder that
went on in them days.’ He hated Major Morrissett,
the Commandant, and never mentioned his name
without cursing bitterly—in spite of the fact that it
was the Major who’d recommended him for his pardon.
“He came out for murder. Killed a keeper, at
home in England, who’d interfered with him when he
was poaching. He’d have been hanged for it, only it
was clearly proved at his trial that the man had
attacked him savagely, and that he’d
only acted in self-defence when he was
in fear for his own life.
“Billy was a tremendously strong
man, and he served in a gang that did
the roughest and heaviest work out at
the end of the breakwater, generally up
to the middle of the body in water. If
a man was put into that lot, it was either
because of his exceptional strength or
because the slavedrivers were afraid of
him and hoped he might be drowned.
And their overseer, a fellow named Ben
Hegarty, was a terrible brute—a bully
and a bruiser, and a man who was abso-
lutely without any bowels of compassion.
The number of casualties in Overseer Hegarty’s gang
always exceeded those on any other part of the con-
struction —not only because it was really dangerous
handling the heavy stones out there in the breaking
seas, but just as much because Hegarty thought
nothing of ordering men to do things that meant
almost certain death. The prisoners hated him fiercely
—and Hegarty knew it, and did his best to get those
men drowned whom he most feared.
“One winter evening he’d kept his gang at their
work long after the usual knock-off time, and had
jeered at and taunted them past all endurance. You
must understand that they were always wet, and that
his keeping them on the job until nearly dark gave
them little chance of drying their clothing before
‘lights out’ sounded and all the prisoners’ fires had
to be put out. They would have to sleep in their wet
garments—all they possessed. They were exasperated
to madness. When at last he sounded his whistle in
the dusk, and they came up out of the chilly water,
one of them cried out ‘lnto the sea with him, boys!’
“So they rushed him, and threw him over the
breakwater, and then commenced to stone him. He
was on the inside of the embankment, and tried to
swim up the river. But the ebb-tide was running out
strongly, and a few of the stones hit him, and it was
certain that he must die by drowning, or, if he tried
to land, that they’d tear him to pieces or bash in his
skull. They were yelling with savage joy at the sight
of their terrible tyrant in his agony. Not one of them
had any pity for him. In all their miserable days at
Newcastle they’d never experienced anything so en-
joyable as the sight of Ben Hegarty in his death
struggles.
“Suddenly Cedar Billy—whom he’d oppressed and
tormented more than any of them —jumped down the

“ Seeing damage done to

realise that bad as things are they
could be very much worse. The

as to food, there is enough of
everything, and I can assure you
no one is going short. Business
is keeping up extraordinarily well.
We are on the up-grade and con-
solidating— most satisfactory.”
There is a postscript. “The only
damage we have suffered is that of
having our front plate-glass win-
dow blown in.” This was hand-
written. Evidently an afterthought,
so soon do wise people accom-
modate themselves to what cannot

During that period of turmoil and suspense,
alternating with elation, the people have sought
comfort and relief each according to his or her
nature and opportunities. One of the finest
tributes ever paid to Pelmanism in its 40 years
of service to the public is the increasing number
of people in Great Britain who sought help in
the Pelman Course of Training. They believed
that it would help them, they found that it did
so, and they told others.
The same tribute of increasing interest month
by month in the Pelman Course has been paid
to the Melbourne Branch by the people of
Australia and New Zealand with a correspond-
ing increase in the number of men and women
who have enrolled for the Course.
This is not merely the reward of excellence.
It is a recognition that the Pelman Course
contains within itself the constituents of the rare
and resolute thinking processes of the peoples of
the British Empire, that no better method than
Pelmanism for generating composure, self-
confidence and courage has ever been evolved.
Pelmanists find themselves better able to take
the strain, to get satisfaction from their leisure
and their recreations, and to be fully effective
units in the prosecution of the work they do.
Pelmanism is scientific training
of Mind, Memory and Personality.
It substitutes good and faithful habits
of mind and memory for slovenly
and fearful ones. Thus it promotes
steadfastness, definiteness, and con-
tinuity of effort.
Among the qualities and attributes
it specifically develops are Observa-
tion, Will-Power, Decision, Self-
Confidence, Judgment, Organisation,
Concentration, Initiative, Social
Ease and a thoroughly dependable
Memory for faces, figures, names,
appointments, prices, and useful
data of every kind.
The Headquarters of the Pelman
Institute are in London. The Mel-
bourne Branch has been established
for 33 years. Over half a million
men and women have gone through
the Pelman Course, of whom more
than 44,000 are in Australia and
New Zealand.

side of the breakwater and stood at the water’s edge.
He turned his face up to the crowd of howling devils
on the top of the bank, and sang out to them. ‘The
dog might get away, lads. I’ll go in and drown the
swine! ’
“Cheered on by his mates he swam out to where
Hegarty was fighting for his life against the tide. It
was almost quite dark by this time, and when Billy
reached the overseer they couldn’t exactly make out
what was happening—beyond the fact that both men
were being swept seaward by the ebb. They waited
for Billy to return, but he didn’t come back, so, after
hanging round for about half an hour or more, they
slouched back to their huts, rejoicing over Hegarty’s
end, but lamenting Cedar Billy.
11 J EGARTY’S gang had a small camp of their
*■ * own, somewhere at the foot of Signal Hill —
that’s Fort Scratchley, you know —and were not locked
up in the gaol every night, like most of the other con-
victs. But about midnight the soldiers came in force
and rounded ’em up, and confined ’em in one of the
gaol-yards. The Commandant would deal with them
in the morning.
“At daylight soldiers and constables searched the
beaches inside and outside the mouth of the river in
an effort to find the bodies of the two missing men,
but not a sign of either of them was to be found, ex-
cepting Ben Hegarty’s hat, which came ashore on the
flood-tide somewhere about the position of the King’s
Wharf today. It was concluded that both men had
been drowned, and their bodies taken by the sharks.
One search party had even crossed the estuary to the
north side and looked for ’em a good way up Stockton
beach, trudging along the sands for about ten miles or
so. But not a trace did they find of Billy or of Ben.
“After breakfast the Major held an inquiry in
the gaol-yard where Hegarty’s gang had camped all
night under a strong guard, but beyond the evidence
of a sub-overseer and a couple of the sentries, who’d
seen from a distance the prisoners rushing Hegarty
after he’d blown the knock-off whistle, he didn’t get
much satisfaction. Morrissett was in a ferocious rage,
and vowed that if the ringleaders weren’t given up
he’d flog the whole gang. He meant what he said,
and told the gang he’d give them till sunset to hand
over half a dozen of the leaders in the riot. If he got
them, he’d send them down to Sydney to stand their
trial for murder. If he didn’t the floggers would get
busy in the morning.
“All those fellows working on the breakwater
were a pretty desperate lot of old lags, some of them
with five or six serious convictions, and there wasn’t
one of them who’d not been flogged at least once, and
many of them had had hundreds of lashes. Not one
of them came forward.
“Morrissett put some of his most cunning pimps
in amongst them that night, but got no satisfaction
at all. He might just as well have tried to collect evi-
dence from the stones in the breakwater. The gang
simply laughed at the spies, and handled a couple of
them pretty roughly. It was no go at all, so the
Major made up his mind to flog the lot of ’em.
“At daylight next day he was down at the gaol
with half a dozen floggers.
“ ‘You damned crew of gallows birds,’ he said to
them, ‘l’ll make you laugh on the other side of your
mouths. You’ll get fifty apiece, and go straight back
to the breakwater. Salt water’s good for sore backs.
I’ll teach you to murder my best overseer!’
“He had pretty well all the garrison under arms,
and had even brought into the gaol a small nine-
pounder gun, loaded with grapeshot, which was
trained on the prisoners. These preparations cowed
them a little, but my father thought—he was present
in the yard—that there wasn’t one of them who didn’t
consider that the drowning of Ben Hegarty compen-
sated for everything.
“Well, the Commandant gave the order for the
flogging to start, and the convict-constables, assisted
by the soldiers, grabbed three of the prisoners and
tied them up, whilst the floggers stood ready with their
cats-o’-nine-tails. But just as the unholy show was
about to begin, the gaoler came hurrying across the
yard to Major Morrissett and said something behind
his hand.
“‘What!’ my father heard Morrissett say. ‘You
don’t say so? Where are they?’
“ ‘At the gate, your honor.’
“ ‘Bring them in here,’ ordered Morrissett, and, to
the amazement of Commandant, soldiers, constables,
prisoners and gaolers, in walked Overseer Hegarty,
followed by Cedar Billy, looking as wooden-faced as
ever. The Commandant stared at them in astonish-
ment, and there wasn’t a sound to be heard in the
yard. They were all flabbergasted, and seemed to
regard the two men as if they’d been ghosts. But they
were real enough when they came to a halt in front
of Major Morrissett and saluted.
“ ‘Well, Hegarty,’ Morrissett said, ‘where the devil
have you been, and what’s this man doing with you?’
“ ‘Your Honor,’ says Hegarty, ‘them bloody dogs
you’re a-floggin’ of, they tried for to drown me, but
this here man, he jumped in an’ saved me. Got
me ashore, over on the nor’ard side, when it
was quite dark. I was fair done, your Honor —a
stone one of ’em chucked cut me head open, and I
was almost finished when Billy got me ashore. The
tide was strong, and he must ha’ had a job. But he
done it. He’s a good man, your Honor, and ’tis Ben
Hegarty says so. He got me into the sandhills betwixt
where we come ashore and Limeburners’ Bay, and all
next day he tended me, getting a few cooked fish
from a blackfellers’ camp over there, and some water,
and nursed me proper. I was too done-up for a couple
of days to move, but at daylight this morning he
brought me across the river, with the help of some o’
them native blacks and their canoes. So here we are,
sir, and I’d like for to recommend him to your Honor
for his good conduct.’
“My father said you could have heard a pin drop
anywhere in the gaol during the pause before the
Commandant spoke. He stared hard at Cedar Billy,
as if he couldn’t easily believe what he’d heard.
“ ‘Look here, my man,’ he asked at last, ‘what
made you rescue Overseer Hegarty?’
“Cedar Billy gaped at the Major without answer-
ing him for a little while. My father said he seemed
a bit dazed. Then he shook his head. ‘l’m damned
if I know, sir—l must ha’ gone a bit silly!’
“ ‘Oh, well,’ says Morrissett, ‘l’ll recommend you
for a pardon, Billy. But as for you scum’ —he turned
to the staring mob of prisoners at the end of the yard
—‘you’ll get what’s coming to you. But it’ll be twenty-
five instead of fifty. I’ve no doubt Overseer Hegarty
vyill make the loss good when he gets you back to the
breakwater. Carry on! ’ ”
THE STRANGER.
Himself a shadow, from the world of shades,
He walks with us, unseeing and unseen,
An immaterial shape, a pervious screen.
The light that wanes and waxes, blooms and fades,
Makes and unmakes him ; like some wandering ghost
He is, and is not. Through a magic portal
He comes, he goes, unknown to any mortal,
And ever he is found, and ever lost.
As in the peak of heaven madly burns
Some insubstantial but illumined cloud,
Now a fierce furnace-mouth, and now a shroud,
He shines, then into shadowland returns.

to darken, the gullies sink into deeper shadows, and
only the tops of the taller trees show the gold of the
sun. Then I found it.
“It’s too late to go on and see about that reef
now,” he said; “too much time’s been wasted. We’ll
barely have enough light as it is to get back home
safely.”
“Will we go by the compass?” I asked.
“Will we go by the compass! ” he snorted. “How
do you think we’d be able to keep our direction in that
maze of wildness without it?”
After we’d been stumbling for some hours, the
bush got darker and closed in on us, and the ground
either failed to meet our feet or else rose up higher
than we had made provision for. Father had to keep
the compass on the job most of the time now —with
the aid of matches, until they ran out —to see that we
didn’t start walking round in circles. Then he said
that the dark, trackless bush was getting too much for
him to handle, and that all the miles he had saved
would have to be thrown away by being forced to
make a long and circuitous trip by an old track he
knew of —if he could find it. This necessary but sad
decision was made after he had cursed dreadfully and
loudly the limb that had ripped the leg of his trousers.
We had no idea of the time now, but it was hours
later when, after striking a line by the compass, we
managed to come out on to an old track. We
couldn’t “travel” in a straight line any more, but had
to “go” with the many twists, curves, bends and wind-
ings that belonged to it. This wriggling track eventu-
ally tipped us out on to the main northern road, miles
from home.
N A OTHER was sitting up when we arrived. It was
twenty-two minutes to four by the clock.
“Where on earth have you been?” she asked
crossly but thankfully.
My father put the compass on the table. “Struck
a mob of very wild cattle and got messed up with our
programme.”
“I thought it was gold that it had to direct you
to —not beef?”
“We didn’t get that far, unfortunately. And owing
to the cattle delaying us, and the darkness coming on,
we had to come home by a long circuitous route.”
“Then the needle didn’t save you any miles after
all?” She looked at his torn trousers. “You look as
if you need more than a magnetic needle now.”
“Can’t blame the instrument for that, mother.
Tore them on a fence in the dark just up the road.’
She picked up the compass. “And it always points
to the magnetic north?” she said.
“Yes.”
“Ah,” she said, sighing. “It’s very wonderful.”
“Yes, mother,” he smiled proudly; “it’s mar-
vellous.”

MR. GRIGG SPROUTS FEATHERS
By CECIL MANN.
IT used to be one of the familiar sights, and one
that the inhabitants regarded with contempt, to
see Mr. Grigg taking his regular Sunday stroll
some of the way round the twelve-mile sweep of
beach. Mr. Grigg never fished on Sundays, but they
knew what he was up to. He was spotting out holes
and channels in the breakers that would be likely places
for jewfish and bream. Then, next night, he’d be off
down the track through the ti-trees and she-oaks and
along the beach to cast out at some prospected spot
marked by the gibbet silhouette of a banksia up on
the sand ridge.
Malice unkindly declared that he didn’t wait till
next night, but would be along there as soon as it
was dark, Sabbath or not. In another form malice
related that one Saturday night Mr. Grigg hooked a
tremendous jewy. He had out a brand-new 200yds.
of No. 12 ; the jewy made him use the lot of it, kept
him on the job for the best part of two hours and
took him nearly three miles round the beach. And
then, not having landed it by midnight, he cut the line
and let it go, rather than desecrate the Sabbath.
Clearly, there was a sense of inferiority where Mr.
Grigg was concerned. It wasn’t that many of them
fished, or felt any desire to fish, on Sundays, but
simply that Mr. Grigg’s abstinence wasn’t normal.
What in anybody else would have been preference or
laziness, in Mr. Grigg was religious superiority, not to
call it hypocrisy. For if there was one thing positive
about Mr. Grigg it was that he was an out-and-out
crank on fishing. To the rest fishing was something
you did if you happened to want a fish to eat, or,
seasonally, when the big black-nose whiting or bream
were in, or the huge jewfish were on night patrol
close in in the breakers. To Mr. Grigg, discovering it
after a lifetime of unexciting drudgery behind a city
counter —to be frank and precise, ham and bacon
department—it was practically a discovery of life itself.
Two other discoveries led him on to it. One was
that there were seven days in the week, instead of
only one. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday, Saturday, Sunday—seven. Then start all over
again: Monday, Tuesday —-each a whole day, a
whole twenty-four hours. Not a rush into the city
inside the screaming cylinder of a train, put on the
white apron, sharpen the knife, get busy, rush home
again. Instead, a full day, composed of hours ; of
early morning, later morning, noon, afternoon, even-
ing, night. Some w'et, some windy, some sunny,
some hot; pitch black, moonlight, half-light. Days
and nights. The curve of the open beach sweeping
round from headland to headland ; the gulls winging
to the horizon ; the pelicans adrift on the swampy
lake that sometimes broke out and flowed blackly
into the sea. That was the time for fish!
The other discovery had gall in it for Mr. Grigg.
It was that the reason the previous proprietor of the
shop could sell to him for a few hundred pounds and
then buy a pub in Paddington was not what he’d kept
on the shelves, but what he’d kept under the counter.
To Mr. Grigg, because of his upbringing and long
habit of mind, this was more than a blow ; it was an
outrage. So he’d taken to fishing partly for consola-
tion ; and, it also taking to him, he lived fish, talked
fish and fished —except on Sundays.
Therefore his abstinence set him singularly on a
pedestal. It set him apart; it explained why he always
fished alone ; why the turnover of the shop—even
counting out the sly-grog, which, it goes without say-
ing, he discontinued —fell off ; why Mr. Grigg, despite
his best efforts and a natural friendliness about the
place, never really fitted into the community. This
was evident in the one fact, more than any other, that
from the first he was always Mr. Grigg.
Actually, all this did Mr. Grigg some injustice.
He’d been trained for a while in his youth to wear
his collar the wrong way round, and, though that had
come to nothing under economic necessity when
Nature, taking brief interest in him, led him into
matrimony, still the habit of mind was there, and all
his life he found it no inconvenience. That is, until
fishing took hold of him.
Some people, perhaps—the dilettanti who wet a
line about once a year, when they’re on holiday ; the
flippant and ignorant who don’t know a Sergeant
Baker from a morwong—might not understand what
that meant to Mr. Grigg. They wouldn’t know, per-
haps, the wild joy of squatting alone at night on a
wind-swept beach, wet to the thighs from getting the
jew-line well out over the breakers, with the driven
sand peppering into their eyes and mouths and down
their necks. They mightn’t know the thrill of a line
suddenly jerked taut, and the whish of it in the water,
with the certainty of its being a fifty-pounder if it was
an ounce, and anything up to an hour before it was
there, high and wet and leaping, on the beach.
They certainly couldn’t know the tormenting
struggle between habit of mind and promptings of
temptation going on inside the somewhat herring-
boned breast of Mr. Grigg as he went on his regular
Sunday stroll. Even those who put him down as a
hypocrite never guessed at that. But so it was. True,
Mr. Grigg went along the beach to spot out likely
holes and washouts in the turning rows of breakers.
But he went also wrestling as an addict with desire ;
and, as it always is, the more he wrestled, the harder
he found the going. No doubt he’d have joined the
damned sooner or later, anyway, even if he’d never
met the pelican.
L_f E saw the old fellow squatting on the beach with
1 1 beak pointed out to sea, like a signpost. As he
approached he was surprised that the grotesque
squatter didn’t get up and waddle off into the water.
Instead, when he was within, only a yard or two, and
with a display of confidence that at once touched Mr.
Grigg, the old chap got up and came towards him,
drawing a thin line over the surface of the sand with a
dragging wing-tip. A yard away it opened its vast
cavern of a beak, made a raucous, squawking sound,
flapped its good wing and clattered its long slats of
bill together like pieces of board.
“Hullo,” said Mr. Grigg sympathetically. “What’s
the matter with you now? Broke your wing, eh?
Somebody shot you, was that it?”
The pelican as good as affirmed this with more
squawking and beak-belting, spread its good wing
wide and flapped it, but shied off, snapping, backing
away and nearly falling over the trailing wing when
Mr. Grigg made to put a hand on it. The short
feathers on its neck came up like a dog’s hackle ; and,
presently, when Mr. Grigg turned to go back, because
the sight of it distressed him, it was like a dog that
it followed along after him, flapping as it waddled,
marking a crooked line on the sand.
The procession of comic little man and his just
as comic grotesque, with the distance between them
widening out, had gone the best part of the way to
the turn-off from the beach before the obvious
occurred to Mr. Grigg, and with it a thought, a turn
of the mind, an inspiration fighting at first thinly, then
strongly, for acceptance.
He stopped and waited for the old fellow to catch
up with him. It came on awkwardly to within a few
“ ’Urry up, Joe, or we'll get soaked!"
feet, and started its one-wing and beak-slapping panto-
mime over again. “Yes, that’s it,” said Mr. Grigg.
“That’s it, isn’t it? You’re hungry, aren’t you? You
want a feed, don’t you? Fish?” shouted Mr. Grigg.
“Fish! FISH!”
| T was a quiet Sunday afternoon, the breakers falling
*■ lazily in slow crashes. Mr. Grigg stood with the
surf washing round his shins, and the whiting line
out over the shelf of sand. On the beach at the back
of him the old fellow squatted, watching him like a
hungry dog. The thin line in Mr. Grigg’s fingers
jerked slightly ; at the next jerk he hooked it, and
then backed up the beach pulling it in.
The old bird, flapping and squawking down,
nearly beat him to it as the silver streak of the whiting
came skipping, gleaming through the shallow water.
Mr. Grigg took it off the hook, and held it out, as if
he was showing a bone to a dog, accepting the flapping
and guttural squawks as expressions of gratitude.
Then he tossed it, the bird caught it deftly, and he
watched it pass lumpily down its throat.
Mr. Grigg had joined the damned. The news that
he was there fishing on Sunday passed round, and the
reason for it. Since when Mr. Grigg fishes on Sun-
day, like any other heathen. The pelican follows him
like a dog, lives with him, camps on the verandah of
the shop. Often they sit out there together, thinking
about fish. Otherwise the shop isn’t much different
from when he took it over. There’s still the same
bell without a tongue in it on the counter ; on the
shelves a row of biscuit-tins, jars of lollies, half-pounds
of tea, tins of camp-pie.
If the door’s shut, it’s no use knocking. Mr.
Grigg—or, rather, as they call him now for obvious
reasons, and for the less obvious reason that he’s now
one of themselves, Featherlegs —old Featherlegs will
be out along the beach, fishing. There’s nothing for
it, if you want, say, a drop of rum to warm the
cockles of your heart, or a bottle of beer to quench
your thirst, but just sit down and wait till they come
back.
Of course, anybody can always fill in the mean-
time fishing. There’s a pretty good bream hole along
there by the dead banksia on the sand ridge.

“Credit” Blather and Section 504
We have had to suffer a lot of wind-
bagging lately (currency revolutionists
release more wind than wisdom)
about “the national credit” and
what should be done with it in order
to avoid taxation, ertc. —especially the
severe war taxes now on the way. A
great deal has been made of the debt
burden handed on from the last war,
and it is usually put forward that utilisa-
tion of national credit would have
avoided this. Perhaps it would have ;
national credit is based on the national
income, and if we had taxed this—thus
“utilising it”—more heavily during the
last war there would have been much
less debt. But when realities like this
are thrown up in the faces of “easy-
way” currency humbugs they become
more outraged than ever; taxation is even
more abhorrent than borrowing. They
forget that “national credit” is only of
value where it represents something that
is wanted.
The most-wanted things are cur-
rently - produced goods and current
services. These are what the nation
requires for a current effort, and there-
fore, in their private lives, people have
to give up using some of them. Only a
small proportion of our defence require-
ments is represented by land, existing
buildings, existing plant and existing
ships, aeroplanes, guns, munitions, etc.
What we want most are things to be pro-
duced now and in the future. Therefore
the nation has to draw on present and
future production more than on past
efforts. The stupidity or hypocrisy
which characterises many windbaggers
about national credit is as exasperating
to intelligent people as it is confusing
to those who have a real grievance in
respect of their economic lot but who
are not mentally equipped to analyse
their problem.
Section 504 of the report of the Bank-
ing Commission is quoted frequently by
people who feel that “something is wrong
with the way things are being done.”
This section says:
Because of this power [of regulating
the volume of credit and controlling the
note issue]... .the Commonwealth Bank
can lend to the Government or to others
in a variety of ways, and it can even
make money available to Governments or
to others free of any charge.
It is typical of many currency revolu-
tionists that they seize on this statement
and proceed to take points in argument
without proceeding any further with the
Commission’s report. Actually, section
504 is simply a statement of fact, like
“a man is capable of drinking gallons of
whisky”—period and exact quantity un-
stated, and effect on health not men-
tioned. On the opposite page of the
Commission’s report this appears:
Sec. 509. An increase in the supply
of money results in some people having
greater ability to buy goods and services.
If these people spend their increased in-
comes, the increased demand for goods is
transmitted through the community. So
long as unemployed men and resources are
available, the increased demand for goods
will result in some increase of production,
with some consequent increase in the em-
ployment of men and resources.
Sec. 510. A general contraction of
[bank] advances, however, is sometimes
necessary to check the development of
boom conditions; and a reduction in the
advances to a particular industry may be
necessary to check an unwarranted degree
of expansion in that industry. On the
other hand, unemployment or depression
in a particular industry cannot necessarily
be cured by general expansion of advances.
Sec. 511. But if the increase in the
supply of money is continued when there
are few unemployed men or resources
available and the expansion of production in
some industries makes it necessary to with-
draw men and resources from others,
higher prices will be offered, and the
money-prices of labor, materials and plant
will be forced up by this competition. The
increase in money may be carried to such a
stage that, although prices rise, there is
little or no increase in the total volume of
production.
There is enough evidence in these
three paragraphs to blow out all the
fantastic theories of “easy money” built
up on the rather openwork pattern of
section 504.
It is impossible to stress too much the
fact that great powers lie in the hands of
Australian industrialists now, and that
they may be even greater after the war
is over, when national security regula-
tions will gradually disappear. Though
the banks, especially the Commonwealth
Bank, represent some check on the busi-
ness methods of industry generally, the
fact remains that the big manufacturing
industries represent a large part of the
organisation that gives jobs and creates
jobs. It is the organisation of these con-
cerns and the attitude of the big trade-
unions on which will depend to
a great extent whether a transfer from
war activity to peace-time production
takes place without great difficulty when
the war is over, Finance can’t do the
job, nor can politics; it is a matter
of industrial organisation and marketing,
with finance only occupying a place. It
was not finance that stopped us from
making a hundred million pounds’ worth
of munitions during the first year of the
war; it was lack of organised plant
capacity and skilled labor. So it will be
when the war is over —a great problem of
putting the right men in the right jobs
with the right equipment to supply some-
thing for which there is a genuine
demand.

The revised company tax proposals
were passed by the House of Represen-
tatives in Canberra last Thursday. Private
companies, so defined by the Common-
wealth Income Tax Acts, were removed
from the scope of the bill; they will in-
stead pay tax on 100 p.c. of undistributed
profits each year to the extent of the
additional tax shareholders would be
liable to pay if all profits were distri-
buted. (Rebates of taxes paid by cos.
in respect of distributed profits have
already been eliminated.) Shareholders
in a private co. will pay on their indi-
vidual incomes from the co. the property
rate applicable to them. Public cos.,
which include all cos. other than private,
will pay 2s. in the £ on their taxable
income and a further 2s. on undistributed
profits. By the provisions of the new
super-tax, a company earning more than
£5OOO will be taxed additionally at the
rate of Is. in the £ or at an increasing
rate on profits “in excess of 8 p.c. on
capital employed,” whichever is the
greater. “In certain circumstances,” said
Mr. Fadden, “the 8 p.c. maximum might
be increased.” The rate of tax appli-
cable under the graduated scale starts at
4 p.c. on the first 1 p.c. in excess of
8 p.c., and rises in steps of 4 p.c. until
it reaches 60 p.c. on profits in excess
of 22 p.c. This is the scale introduced
in the first (objectionable) measuie. Last
week’s bill is not particularly satisfactory
even now ; it avoids the real principle of
excess-profits taxation, but it at least
guarantees that some big fish won’t escape
all war taxation. Small cos. are still in
a false position except where they happen
to fall into the category of “private” cos.
Elaborating on the incidence of the
bill, Mr. Fadden said:
The bill exempts life assurance companies
whose profits are divisible only among the
policy-holders.
Briefly, capital for the purposes of the
bill will consist of capital paid up in money
or by other valuable consideration and
accumulated profits. The term accumu-
lated profits includes reserves created out
of profits.
The relevant provisions of the bill will
not permit companies which have created
reserves through the writing up of the
value of assets, possibly with the object
of issuing bonus shares, to receive advan-
tage over other companies. The bill con-
tains special provision for the adjustment
of capital in those cases where the value
of assets in the books of a company is
in excess of the cost, or the depreciated
value as determined for income tax pur-
poses.
The bill provides for a minimum capital
of £12,500, except in the case of a sub-
sidiary company. That minimum capital
ensures that a company will not have a
lower percentage standard than £lOOO.
In the case of a life assurance company
not wholly mutual, provision has been
made under which the amount by which
the reserve for liabilities exceeds the “cal-
culated liabilities,” for the purposes of sec-
tion 114 of the Income Tax Assessment Act,
will be treated as capital.
Mr. Fadden added that deletion of divi-
dends paid by one co. to another would
avoid double taxation.
* * * *
According to Treasurer Fadden, the
increase in the statutory income-tax
exemption from £l5O to £2OO would
mean a loss of estimated revenue
amounting to £2,500,000. The revised
form of the companies tax will bring in
£1,800,000 more than estimated. The ls.-
a-week lift in pensions will cost £900,000
a year.
* * * *
As far as could be ascertained
last week, that taxation monstrosity the
portion of the N. S. Wales Stamp
Duties Amendment Act under which
succession duties became payable on
estates in which a life tenant existed
has been repealed by a further amend-
ment of the Act. The succession duties
have had about 12 months’ currency, and
where a life tenant died before the pro-
visions were repealed the duties are still
payable—the effect of the repeal is not
nearly so retrospective as the Act itself
was. An air of mystery and agitation
surrounded the measure from its birth
to its decease.
* * * *
After a certain amount of puffing and
blowing, the Prices Commissioner has
sanctioned a rise in matches of 2d. to
2+d. a dozen boxes. Quite a steep lift.
In August there was a row over a rise
of lOd. a gross made by the Federal
Match Co. because of increases in costs.
According to Professor Copland,
These increases in cost had been investi-
gated, but the company was informed on
August 16 that the Prices Commissioner
desired to examine the gross profit margin
before permitting an increase in prices.
Despite the intimation that it was desired
that the increase should be withheld pend-
ing the investigation of profits, the com-
pany proceeded to sell matches at the
higher prices. An order compels the
company to revert to its pre-war prices
pending the review of profits.
C. G. Sundstrom, managing director of
the Federal Match Co., then stated that
since July the co. had been making
matches at a loss. Last week Professor
Copland said he had granted permission
for “Federal” matches to be raised 3d. a
dozen above pre-war prices. This was
made up of Id. allowed in October and
the present 2d. granted “because of
higher excise and sales tax.” Matches
at 9d. a dozen in N. S. Wales are now
50 p.c. higher than pre-war. In other
States the price is B^d.

THE SHELL COMPANY OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED (Incorporated in Great Britain)
Producers’ Oilwell Supplies
A motion for continuing the injunction
against Senator T. Arthur and Malcolm
Beattie, two directors of Producers’ Oil-
well Supplies, Ltd., was heard in Sydney
Equity Court last week. An interim in-
junction (B. 11/12/’4O) had previously
been granted restraining Arthur and
Beattie from excluding John C. Mackay
(managing director) and Richard Patton
(secretary) from the co.’s offices.
Last week it was complained that, since
the order, Mackay and Patton had been
refused access to the co. s books and
records. Nicholas, J., said if refusals
were repeated the Court would attach the
person responsible.
The Court had read to it an affidavit
by H. E. Culyer, an accountant engaged
by Arthur and Beattie to inspect the
co.’s books. Since Jan. 1, said Culyer,
£18,719 had been paid to the co. for
shares, but none had been allotted. It
had been impossible to ascertain from
the share-register the position regarding
capital and to whom it had been issued.
A balance sheet prepared at the instiga-
tion of Mackay and Patton for the share-
holders’ annual meeting in July was false,
and had been the subject of complaint
by the Victorian Registrar of Companies.
A statement showed that during the
period to Sept. 30 £15,958 had been paid
out in establishment exes., brokerage, etc.,
£1405 in general exes., £BlO in travelling
exes, and £647 in instalments on cars
bought.
Beattie, by affidavit, said that Mackay
and Patton had asked him to sign
cheques in blank in order to save time.
Early in October he signed four cheques
in this way, but, becoming worried,
visited the office next day with Senator
Arthur and asked for the cheque book.
One cheque, for £l6 55., had been made
out to George Draper for Mackay’s elec-
tioneering expenses, and had nothing to
do with the co.’s business. Subsequently
he (Beattie) and Arthur took possession
of the books, papers, etc., and excluded
Mackay and Patton. Though investi-
gations showed that the co. had received
£18,719 from shareholders, there was only
£290 in the bank on Sept. 30. About
£15,000 had been disbursed in extrava-
gant payments to salesmen and in office
salaries and rent. Three scrip books
were missing. Founders’ shares were
issued by the co. subject to an endorsed
condition that they were “untransferable
until commercial oil had been struck,
and, if pledged, sold or transferred, they
immediately became void.” Mackay had
purported to cancel these conditions on
certain shares by issuing substitute scrip
free of these restrictions. Beattie con-
cluded by stating that as soon as investi-
gations were completed he proposed
calling shareholders together.
At this stage the motion was part
heard. The injunction granted to Mackay
and Patton continued until Dec. 16.
The profit of Carlton and United
Breweries and subsidiaries for the 12
months to June 30 was £593,573, com-
pared with £545,127 in the preceding year.
C.U.B.’s own earnings were £570,610,
against £528,892. Div. to the holding
cos. is unchanged at 124 p.c. Altogether,
a record year for the C.U.B. group. Scrip
of the most-traded-in listed co. (Carlton)
was active at 675. last week, yielding 4.5
p.c. on a 15 p.c. div. basis.
* * * *
Swan Brewery, Perth, still makes
plenty .of cash after 15 months of war.
An increase in profit from £123,963 to
£159,809 over the last 12 months has
followed a bonus issue of 680,624 ss.
shares and a cash issue of 400,000 shares
of the same denomination. Div. on the
increased ord. capital has been main-
tained at 25 p.c. The directors believe
the bonus issue to be free of Federal,
Westralian and Victorian income tax, but
to be subject to Victorian special tax.
In the current year the co. will encounter
the first turn of the war-tax screw. We
are now commencing to pay for the fight.
* * * *
Zinc Corp. has dropped its interim
div. on ord. and pref. shares from Is. 6a.
to Is. 3d. a share. Apparently British
taxation is the explanation, since North
B.H. and B.H. South had no difficulty
in maintaining their rates. Zinc Corp.
ords. are at 655. in Australia, which com-
pares with 41s. 6d. for North scrip. In
pre-war days Zinc ord. shares were priced
at twice the figure paid for North’s ; in
the absence of different rates of taxation
Zinc shares should still command the
same premium. They should be good
buying for long holding.
In a statement following announce-
ment of the div., directors of Zinc Corp.
said that, because of increased output
and higher efficiency on the part of the
new plant, profits for the year to Dec. 31
were better than in 1939. The board, in
reducing the div., was concerned about
the future of Australian taxation as well
as British.

Australia’s total outlay on defence and
war between July 1, 1939, and Nov. 30
was £109,524,000. The outlay was
met, as to £31,693,000, from revenue ; as
to £75,225,000, from loans; and as to
£2,606,000, from trust accounts. In sup-
plying these figures Senator Mcßride said
that included in the loans were subscrip-
tions to Government loans from the
Commonwealth Bank and trading banks.
Details of such subscriptions weren’t
available. Total cost of the last war to
Australia, according to figures supplied
last year, was £877,000,000 up to June
30, 1939, including £305,000,000 of in-
terest.

Ormonoid Roofing, a Sydney co. with

paid 15 p.c. divs. since listing two or
three years ago, and the scrip is obtain-
able at 275., yielding 11.1 p.c. A small
parcel of the shares in a welLspread
assortment of scrip might not be out of
place.


UNCABLED ADDITIONS
A FUTURE FOR DEMOCRACY.
{Condensed from a New York “Times Magazine”
article by Geoffrey Crowther, the editor of London
“Economist.”)
For the first nine months of the war the main
current of thought, in America and in Britain, ran
along the line of a new international order. The
vogue, on both sides of the Atlantic, of the doctrine of
federal union was a sign that men’s minds were
thinking of reconstruction in such terms. That democ-
racy would triumph, that it would be accepted by the
peoples of Europe as a blessed relief from tyranny,
was taken almost for granted.
This order of thought now looks very foolish.
It is no longer a question of what the democracies
shall do to Europe, but of what Europe threatens to
do to the democracies. We, Britain and America,
are not up against a foolish and passing infatuation
from which the peoples of Europe will, in due course,
free themselves. We are up against a new fanatical
religion which can command the utter devotion of
its subjects and is equipped with a fiendish efficiency.
Hitler is not the only one who cannot afford to
stand still. Indeed, he can possibly afford it better
than we can. If he can only hold what he has, he has
enough raw material for decades of triumph. But we
must either submit to being pushed aside or else we
must reconquer the world for democracy. And to do
that we must demonstrate that democracy can be as
active and dynamic a creed as any the Nazis possess;
we must satisfy the craving of the ordinary man to be
given, not merely a set of intellectual doctrines, but a
burning faith that will move mountains.
The task before us is to increase the tempo of
democracy, to make it as dynamic in its action and
as attractive in its appeal as the doctrines of violence.
How is this to be done?
The complete answer can only be unfolded gradu-
ally by the movement of events. But a beginning can
be made by seizing on the salient difference between
our way of life and theirs and by capitalising it to our
advantage. That difference lies in the relations
between the State and the individual. Our doctrine
is that the State exists to protect and serve the citi-
zen ; that the aim of all public policy should be the
fuller emancipation of the human spirit; that the right
to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a self-
evident truth. Their doctrine is that the individual
has no rights against the State and no purpose on
earth save to serve the State, even though the State
may have been pre-empted by a gang of adventurers.
We may deplore and detest the solution that
Hitler and Stalin have found for the problem of the
relation of the individual to the State. But does not
our own solution need refreshening? It still rests upon
the great advance of a century and a half ago, when
the political rights of the citizen were codified and
established —in France by the Revolution, in America
by the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of
Rights, and in Britain less concisely but no less really
by the Era of Reform. Since those days democracy
has rested on the pillars of liberty of speech, thought
and writing, of toleration, of equality before the law
and of representative government. Has not the time
come for us to go farther?
The citizen of a democracy should be guaranteed
not merely his political liberties, but also the economic
minimum without which the pursuit of happiness is
merely an empty phrase. In this conception of a Bill
of Human Rights the individual would be guaranteed,
by virtue of his citizenship, a certain minimum of
food and clothing and decent shelter. He would be
assured of a sufficiency if he failed, through any of
the accidents of life such as unemployment, old age
or injury, to be able to earn his own living. Whatever
his economic standing, he would have access to full
and careful medical attention. He would have educa-
tion to develop all his capacities. Above all, the com-
munity would see to it that the blessing of children
did not march hand in hand with the curse of poverty ;
every parent would be assured of the wherewithal to
provide his children with the elementary necessities of
life.
There is no reason why this should sound like a
distant dream. We already have old-age pensions,
compulsory health insurance, housing subsidies, com-
pensation for accidents, unemployment pay, pensions
for widows, orphans and blind persons and universal
free education.
There are gaps to be filled, but they are small
relatively to what has already been achieved. Nor
would such a national minimum be too costly for the
community to bear. At a rough calculation, such a
minimum standard of living would absorb about half
of the national income in Britain. It is surely not too
much to suggest that the first half of the community’s
income should go to insuring a minimum standard of
decent living for its citizens.
It is the essence of a proposal such as this that
the minimum should be guaranteed to every citizen
as of right. There should be no more charity implied
in it than is implied in the right of habeas corpus.
The proposal is that the Bill of Political Rights should
be supplemented by a Bill of Economic Rights, so that
the democracies could proclaim to the whole world
“These are the unequalled advantages of citizenship in
a democracy.” What can be offered in their place
by rival systems where wealth and freedom alike are
swallowed up by the tyranny of force?
This appeal would be powerful; but we cannot
hope to win converts to democracy by bribery alone.
Nor shall we be laying a sound basis if we encourage
the Santa Claus theory of the State. A community
can guarantee benefits to its members only through
their co-operation, and this too needs to be brought
within our new vision of the democratic community.
If the State guarantees a minimum of rights to the
citizen, then the citizen has a minimum of duties to
the State. We realise this in war-time, when every
citizen is anxious to give his service in the common
cause. Shall we not be wise to recognise that there are
services to be performed in peace-time, too? The most
obvious, but the least fruitful, is the obligation on the
citizen to prepare in peace for his role in the defence
of the country in war.
The conservation of natural resources is an
obvious case in point. Voluntary medical and nurs-
ing services could be accompanied within a national
medical service. There is an endless field for service
in education and social welfare, and perhaps the
largest scope of all is in caring for the children of the
people.
If an extended Bill of Minimum Rights were
coupled with a Bill of Minimum Duties, the State and
the citizen would have put their relations on a sound
—New York “Journal and American.”
“REMEMBER ME?”
and solid basis of reciprocal benefit. Democracy
would have set up its charter for the twentieth cen-
tury : security without slavery, freedom without
poverty, progress without violence.
A Letter from London.
[lntimate human glimpses of life in bombed London,
conveyed by J. C: Wedgwood, M.P. (Lab.), in a
letter to a friend in America.]
“We come out at dawn like rats, and climb to
the ninth floor. Up goes the blackout blind, and we
look over the same old city. A tooth more, here and
there, has gone; but the power station across the
river still sends up its twin banners of smoke. It has
seen us through the nights of ruin, unchecked, a
triumphant dynamo. We seize the newspapers, punc-
tual as usual.
“One gets indifferent as to whether the sirens
register ‘off’ or ‘on’; but I never get indifferent to
bombs cracking the sky. Miners take it best. An
old one from South Wales said to me when I remon-
strated, ‘Ah, lad! I’ve heard the roof crack afore
now.’ The excellent Minister for Mines, who was one
himself, was knocked flat in Whitehall, where they
have peppered us freely. He just picked himself up
and walked to his office. I still run like a rabbit into
my doorway when the crash comes.
“For the first hour in the Commons, we heckle
all that low row of Ministers. There are not so many
left to ask questions now, and often the Minister will
come over and say ‘Don’t put that question ; I can’t
answer properly.’ Roof-spotters tell us when to
adjourn. There’s no safety in going down to the crypt,
so most go to the library and write this sort of thing
to their mothers.
“We never manage to get through supper before
the night strafe begins, and my wife, being deaf, will
not hurry ; insists on cleaning up before we go down
to Lady Snowden’s deserted flat on the second floor.
“Our immense block of flats is reinforced con-
crete. We have been hit seven times, twice on the
roof and nothing went except the top floor, but over
1000 of our 4000 windows gape drunkenly. One came
in slantwise and got the shelter, ‘causing some casual-
ties.’
“These subterranean shelters must house 2000
people, not only residents but those unfortunates who
live in brick houses all around. It is a sort of club,
where we all get together to exchange news, cigarettes
and experiences. It looks like the ’tween decks of an
emigrant ship. You don’t hear so much down there ;
but nobody dares to look afraid when you do hear.
All resolutely set the tone.
“One goes to bed, on bed, mattress or shelf, eariy,
the ladies in their ‘siren-suits’ with torch ready in case
the lights fail. You lie and listen to the brute wander-
ing about overhead. It always seems exactly overhead.
He drones along, and you await the crack and crash,
the triple explosion, for they always drop them in
a ‘stick’ of three. Is the droning going away or coming
nearer is one’s constant preoccupation in bed. Our
guns, always difficult to distinguish from bombs, start
bellowing afresh after each loud explosion. We know
they can’t see or hit; but they are comforting.
“It goes on all night. You hear it in your dreams;
and then pause, and ‘All clear’ goes—as day filters in.”
U.S. Stake in the Pacific.
(From a speech by Rear-Admiral Harry E. YarneU,
former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet.)
The U.S. has as Pacific possessions not only that
great group of islands the Philippines, but also the
Hawaiian Islands, Guam, Wake, Midway, Canton,
American Samoa and numerous small ones. The
Aleutian Islands extend to within a few hundred miles
of Asia. At Bering Strait the U.S. is within sight of
the Asiatic mainland. ' The U.S. is responsible for the
protection of all these islands, and even after 1946
will naturally have a sympathetic interest in and a
moral responsibility for the future of the Philippines.
The U.S. has treaties with China and with other
nations regarding the Far East, and it has long been
recognised by U.S. statesmen that China’s stability
and integrity are essential to the maintenance of peace
in the Far East. By the open-door policy, enunciated
by Secretary Hay in 1900, China was saved from dis-
memberment and annexation by other nations. The
integrity of China was pledged in the Nine-Power
Treaty of 1922, to which the United States is a signa-
tory.
Politically, the U.S. is interested in the English-
speaking Dominions to the southward, Australia and
New Zealand, and the fate that awaits them in the
future. The U.S. is interested in maintaining the
status quo in the Pacific and in the Far East, and
concerned with the threats against its citizens and
their right to dwell and carry on their business under
equal terms with those of other nations.
Economically the U.S. has a vast stake in the
Far East. In 1937 over one-fourth of its foreign
trade was with Asia and Oceania. It amounted to
$1,700,000,000. It was nearly two-and-one-half times
greater than U.S. trade with South America.
Practically all the rubber used by the U.S. comes
from the Netherlands Indies, Malaya and Indo-
China. The U.S. receives annually 850,000 tons of
sugar from the Philippines. The U.S. buys more than
one-third of the world’s output of tin, and most of
it comes from the South China Sea area. More than
50 million dollars’ worth of copra and coconut oil
comes annually from the Philippines. Abaca, or
Manila hemp is a world monopoly of those islands.
The world’s supply of quinine comes from the Nether-
lands indies, and the U.S. is the world’s largest con-
sumer. The largest-known chromite deposit in the
world is in the Philippines. Of seven major U.S.
imports, six are major export products of the Far
East. U.S. trade with the Philippines amounts to over
$200,000,000 annually. They stand fifth in the list of
overseas areas.
At the present time, all U.S. interests in the Far
East are threatened by a nation that has proclaimed
a “New Order in East Asia.” This vague phrase
means the extension of Japanese domination by force
of arms over the entire Far East, and the expulsion
of U.S. citizens and trade from that area. This has
happened in Korea, in Manchuria, in the occupied
parts of China, and it will happen in every area con-
trolled by Japanese bayonets.
Hundreds of notes have been written by the U.S.
Government protesting against violation of treaties,
and the treaty rights of U.S. citizens, and assaults
against their persons and property. Scant courtesy
has been given these notes, and many of them remain
unanswered.
The momentous question confronting the U.S.
nation today is how long or to what extent it will
submit to infringement or destruction of rights and
interests by nations that respect nothing but force.
Appeasement and concession have been a failure
both in Europe and in Asia. They are interpreted by
Germany and Japan as weakness, and win only con-
tempt followed by increased insults and acts of aggres-

sion. If other means fail, the defence of U.S. rights
and vital interests by force is the only method of pre-
serving them.
Anglo-Japanese Relations.
(Condensed from an article by G. S. Sale in London
“National Review.’’)
Anglo-Japanese relations have become so greatly
strained and the consequences of a breach between
the two countries —while we are engaged in a life-and-
death struggle with Hitler —would be so grave that no
excuse is needed for reviewing the underlying events
which have brought about the present unhappy state
of affairs, with the object of finding a permanent solu-
tion. But this should be done from an Empire point
of view, discarding sectional prejudices and disre-
garding press propaganda which has been so anti-
Japanese during the last few years.
All those who know Japan best are agreed that
the history of bad relations between England and
Japan goes back to the failure of England to renew
the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1921. To the Japanese
this was an act of bad faith and lack of loyalty to an
old friend, the greatest crime in the Japanese calendar.
To understand the events of the last 10 years one must
always have this background in mind.
It seems inherent for the Chinese to dislike
all foreigners and to play off one nation against
another, concentrating on one at a time. It
fell to the lot of Great Britain to bear the
brunt of China’s animosity from 1924 to 1927
when Sun Yat Sen, aided and abetted by Boro-
din, stirred up popular agitation against the
British in China. We yielded our concession
in Hankow ; British property was looted and
British lives lost in Nanking, and British gun-
boats had to fire in defence of British property
and lives. Eventually a force of some two
divisions had to be dispatched to Shanghai to
protect the international settlements from the
victorious soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek and the
defeated Northerners. The last remnants of
this force have only just been withdrawn, 13
years later.
Until 1927 Japanese policy, guided by
Baron Shidehara, was one of appeasement
towards the Chinese, but the Chinese, encour-
aged by the success of their tactics of intimida-
tion against Great Britain, next turned their
efforts against the Japanese, instituting a cam-
paign of pinpricks, intimidation and boycotts.
As trade in China was vital to her interests
(constituting such a large proportion of her
total), Japan was unable to adopt the sur-
render policy which had been ours. The action
taken by Japan in 1937 naturally cannot be
approved of as it cannot be denied that it was
of an aggressive character. At the same time,
it is completely forgotten that Japan is fighting for her
economic existence. In view, however, of the enor-
mous trade interests that other countries have in
China, it is essential that this war should be stopped
at the earliest possible moment not only for our sakes
but for the sake of China and Japan.
There is no real clash of commercial interests
between Japan and Great Britain. There is ample
room for both British and Japanese trade in China.
The Japanese will always have the advantage in cer-
tain lines such as piecegoods and consumptive goods
in general —the products of light industry owing to
their cheaper costs of production and their propin-
quity to China. America enjoys a monopoly in China
for motor-cars and motor-lorries, tobacco and largely
oil, with which Japan does not now compete. So the
opportunities for Great Britain in China will be with
goods of a capital nature —products of heavy industry.
There is enormous scope in this field in which Japan
will not be able to compete.
If it is decided that it suits the policy of Great
Britain to seek a rapprochement with Japan —
especially now that we are engaged in our vital
struggle with Hitler —I do not think it is impossible
to straighten out our relations. If we wish to win back
the friendship of Japan, we must have a continuity
of policy aimed to win over the Japanese, and here
probably the greatest obstacle lies in the anti-Japanese
feeling continually and prominently displayed by doc-
trinaires, intelligentsia and rabid supporters of the
League of Nations Union, which finds an echo both in
our sensational press and even in the sober organs.
Some measures, some means, some ways must be found
to enlighten at least a portion of the press so that they
have some comprehension of the Far Eastern situation.
This enlightenment should come from the Foreign
Office.
We must be prepared for the fact that, as our
efforts to regain the friendship and confidence of the
Japanese begin to look like being successful, the Ger-
man faction and German propagandists in Japan will
redouble their counter-offensive, nad we must not fall
into the trap.
It is in our power to help the Japanese in two
ways, which the Germans cannot:
(1) We can help to bring about peace in China.
If we succeed in establishing better relations with
Japan we shall be in a far stronger position to help
China and might, perhaps, form a bridge to bring the
two countries to a mutually satisfactory peace based
on the Japanese proposals, which are: (a) No terri-
torial ambitions in China whatsoever. ( b ) No in-
demnities. (c) Complete sovereign rights for China.
(d) No interference with foreign rights and interests.
The only difficulty would be in the following: ( e )
Japan demands the establishment of a Central Gov-
ernment in Nanking containing no subversive elements,
and this Government must guarantee that there shall

be no further boycotts of or hindrances to Japanese
trade. But surely, if we advised General Chiang Kai-
shek to come to terms with Japan on the basis sug-
gested, we should be doing China the best service that
any friend could.
(2) An offer to Japan of certain raw materials
which she cannot get elsewhere and a quota in cer-
tain of our Empire markets.
With these assets it should not be beyond the
ability of our statesmen to bring to a close a very
unhappy period in the relations between Japan and
Great Britain and one which, particularly at this
moment, is fraught with the greatest danger to the
Empire.
The General War Situation.
(.4i seen in a New York “Herald Tribune aiticle,
here condensed.)
The best which the familiar “reliable sources” in
Berlin can actually claim for the Nazi-Soviet accord
boils down to little more than a non-aggression pact.
In return for a future claim on Afghanistan, India
and Persia, it is intimated, Stalin has promised to give
the Japanese a free hand in the East and Hitler com-
plete domination, safeguarded from Russian inter-
ference, in the West.
Some such bargain may have been signed while
Molotov was in Berlin. If so, one is struck by the
nebulous character of the return Stalin gets for such
concessions, and one is led to the inference that it
is a bargain of momentary expediency, perhaps ade-
quate to neutralise Russia for the time being, but
otherwise worth no more than any other totalitarian
promise.
If Hitler has neutralised Russia, what benefit will
it be to him? He may get some additional supplies,
but past experience makes that rather doubtful. He
may be guaranteed against any interference in opera-
tions through Rumania and Bulgaria directed at Con-
stantinople and the British Fleet. However, any
Balkan drive has been vastly complicated by the folly
of the Italians. And there is more and more reason
to believe that in turning to Russia Hitler, so far
from completing his grandiose empire, has been put-
ting a heavier strain upon its other end in Rome,
Madrid and Vichy.
Neither Italy nor Spain can march comfortably
in step with the Soviets. It seems probable that the
assault on Greece, of which the Nazis uncomfortably
washed their hands, was an attempt by the junior
partner in the Axis to steal a march on the senior
while there was yet time ; its disastrous outcome has
had the treble effect of dislocating Hitler’s own Balkan
plans, widening the Nazi-Fascist breach, and bringing
Italy into a deadly peril from the British Fleet and
British bombers. It also seems probable that behind
the wretched showing of the Italians on land, sea
and in air there is a critical want of oil fuel and other
materials, a want which must be spreading even into
Germany as it faces the second cold and hungry
winter of the war which was to be over in two montns.
The best picture one can draw of Hitler from
available evidence is not that of the Nazi propaganda ;
it is the picture of the desperate gambler of the Wil-
helmstrasse, pyramiding his winnings under ever
greater pressure until they have built up into an over-
grown, uneasy, disorganised and necessitous empire,
resting on the fearfully weak reeds of Italy and Japan,
driven to dicker with the Soviets, and baffled in every
attempt to break the supreme centre of resistance in
the hearts of the British people.
No one would imagine for a moment that the
war has been won. But these are some of the reasons
for believing that the prospect is actually brighter
today than in many months.
Old-style v. New-style War.
(From a report by the Athens correspondent of New
York “Times.”)
Warfare on the Greek-Italian front has been con-
ducted on an old model, and mechanisation and
modern equipment are not out of proportion to man’s
fighting ability and human courage. It is warfare in
which the human spirit again has its part. The human
element counts. Red blood is more important than
gasoline.
Competent military observers here say that about
three-fourths of the fighting has been done with
bayonets and rifles which hardly differ from those used
a quarter of a century ago. Such testimony as wounded
soldiers returned from the firing line are able to give
indicates that hand-to-hand fighting has been a main
feature of the hostilities.
The Greeks have for the most part conducted
their amazingly successful exploits on a primitive
scouting pattern. They have not hesitated to discard
all impediments for swift action. Case after case is
reported of small Greek squads capturing enemy con-
crete strongholds by stealth with equipment reduced
to rifle, bayonet and perhaps a few grenades.
Such howitzers, mortars, machine-guns and moun-
tain guns as have been used have been brought into
position by mules. In fact, it is only now that the
Greeks are acquiring a substantial mechanised depart-
ment in their army. Thanks for this is due to the
Italians, who left behind much material in their suc-
cession of hasty retreats.
The Italians have relied on the latest tricks of the
new military trade, intending no doubt a mountain
version of the German Blitzkrieg. One of the reasons
for their failure, as offered to this correspondent, is
that they so entirely misunderstood the type of tactics
essential to the terrain. They also completely mis-
judged the Greek temperament and the age-old con-
formity to instinct to defend home and honor.
The Italians frequently hampered their own move-
ments and contributed to their own defeat by bringing


with them cumbersome anti-tank guns when it would
appear that their own General Staff must have known
that there was no need for such weapons.
In the same way the Italians reduced their own
cause to nearly nothing through overemphasis on
modern high-powered inflationary propaganda. From
questioning Italian prisoners it is learned that most of
them had been sold on the idea that the Greeks were
only too delighted to have them as guests. When the
truth became known the shock was enormous, and this
resulted in demoralisation, which in turn, in instance
upon instance, brought about a complete rout.
Lessons from Nazi Methods.
o Condensed from a London “Times” article.)
Many people have been puzzled to understand
how the Nazi Government, succeeding to a bankrupt
German Treasury, has been able, without any notice-
able damage to the internal value of the currency, to
set to work millions of unemployed and to build up
armaments and reserves of war materials on a colossal
scale, besides carrying out a grandiose programme of
public works.
The achievement has been so surprising that for
a long time outside critics were inclined to regard it
as a kind of optical delusion, the result of conjuring
tricks by Dr. Schacht, which would soon fade away
to give place to another collapse even grimmer than
that which followed the post-war inflation. As time
went on, and these expectations refused to be
realised, opinion began to swing to the opposite
extreme. An uneasy suspicion became current that the
Nazis had really discovered ways of making something
out of nothing and that the rest of the world would
do well to imitate them. Where does the truth lie
between the two extremes?
It is, of course, absurd to belittle what has been
done in Germany. There is nothing “fictitious”
about the re-employment of the workless, about the
enormous increase both in production and in produc-
tive capacity, or, as we know to our cost, about Ger-
man armaments and reserves of war supplies. On the
other hand, though no one is now so foolish as to
imagine that Hitler is likely to be hampered in his
war plans by any difficulty in financing them, there are
flaws in the structure which are bound sooner or later
to make themselves felt. We should, however, study
the Nazis’ achievement, equally prepared to adopt
whatever may be useful in it and to take warning from
its mistakes.
The essential feature of the new German economic
system is not its self-sufficiency. When they resolved
to import nothing which could be made at home, and
to find substitutes wherever possible for what they
could not make themselves, the Nazis were to a great
extent making a virtue of a necessity. More charac-
teristic was the rigid control which they established
over the foreign exchanges to insulate their currency
from the inflationary effects of what was the main-
spring of their system —the so-called closed financial
circuit by which money made available by the State
to set industries going was carefully sucked back again
by loans and taxation, aided by a vast network of
controls and restrictions which kept wages down and
hours up and prevented all spending except such as
suited the Government.
For its success the system needed the recurrent
conquest, or at least the economic absorption, of new
territories to provide fresh stocks of materials and
fresh markets for expansion. It has involved also the
piling up of an enormous debt, which, no doubt,
Hitler hopes in due course to shift on to other
shoulders. In fact, the whole system has been based
upon the prospect of war and the hope of victory. No
people, not even the Germans, could have endured the
regimentation, the restrictions, the sacrifices of the past
seven years except under the stimulus of patriotic war
fervor and in the hope of recompense when Germany
achieved world mastery.
Certainly no one in this country would tolerate
the suppression of all individual freedom and initiative
necessary to make these methods effective. But that
does not mean that we have nothing to learn from
them. They have set useful examples by their deter-
mination that the unemployed must be given useful
work and not left to rot in idleness ; that investment
must be guided to serve national purposes and not left
to be influenced solely by considerations of private
profit; that the pressure of scarcity of necessary com-
modities must not be allowed to fall entirely upon the
poor but spread over the whole community by equit-
able rationing ; and in their recognition that the pro-
motion of export trade demands the co-operation of
the many interests involved.
The establishment of the United Kingdom Trade
Corporation, unfortunately too late to be effective in
the countries it was intended to serve, shows that we
are not above learning a lesson, however tardy we may
be about it. And as the war has gone on we have
taken other hints from the Nazi model. What is
needed is a fresh study of the whole position in the
resolve to get all the benefit we can from forethought
and organisation while preserving the individual liberty
and initiative which alone can give elasticity to any
system.
A correspondent who has had exceptional oppor-
tunities for studying the Nazi system has given a warn-
ing to which we shall do well to give heed in time.
Discussing the genesis of Nazi economics he says:
“Beyond doubt one of the fundamental causes of this
war has been the unrelaxing efforts of Germany since
1918 to secure wide enough foreign markets to
strengthen her finances at the very time when all her
competitors were forced by their own debts to adopt
exactly the same course.” It is not too early to be
working out ways of dealing with the problems which
will arise when once again all the participants in the
present war will be driven by the pressure of accu-
mulated debt to seek to sell at any price while none
will be willing to buy.
Problem of Surplus Food.
[While severe shortage, if not actual famine, threatens
parts of Europe, huge surpluses of wheat and other
food stocks are accumulating elsewhere. Plans for the
post-blockade distribution of these surpluses and for
solving other problems of Europe’s future food supply
are outlined in the article here condensed from the
Manchester “Guardian.”]
A Committee of Ministers is engaged on the
problem of the surpluses of food and raw materials
that are accumulating overseas, plans being made for
the use of these supplies in Europe in the different
areas now under Nazi rule so soon as that rule is over-
thrown. These plans involve the co-operation of the
United States, the Latin American States and the
Dominions —plans which have been described as the
beginning of a world economic plan for the future.
This problem has long been engaging the atten-
tion of Ministers in Canada and Australia. It is ex-
pected that the surpluses of wheat in Canada, Aus-
tralia, the United States and Argentina will exceed
eleven hundred million bushels. The case of wheat
is not peculiar; almost all primary products are in the
same difficulty. The management of this large prob-
lem will be one of the chief tasks of the international
body or bodies that will have to reorganise Europe
after the war.
Committees of the League of Nations which were
set up at the instance of the Australian delegates a
few years ago have suggested measures by which
—New York "Journal and American.”
THEY STILL FLY!
Europe can attack two problems at the same time, the
problem of preserving its agriculture and of raising its
standard of life. The statistics for Great Britain show
that there is not much difference in the amount of
bread consumed between the man who spends five
shillings a week on food and the man who spends
eleven shillings or more, whereas the second man
spends six times as much on milk, eleven times as
much on butter and three times as much on vegetables.
From the point of view of health and vitality the
foods that it is important to spread more widely are
the foods of which the rich consume so much more
than the poor.
It happens that Europe is in an excellent position
for producing these foods. A European country there-
fore would be wise to turn more of its energy to the
production of the protective foods and to the perish-
able commodities. This has been done with great
advantage by Bulgaria, where a wise Government, in
the depression of 1928-30, encouraged the peasants to
turn from wheatgrowing to poultry, dairy-farming
and the cultivation of fruit and vegetables.
The way, then, to save agriculture for Europe is
not to keep our overseas wheat at great cost but to
give more attention to other forms of food production
and to raise the whole standard of life by a bold policy
of development and by large social reforms. The use
of a European development fund for improving com-
munication, transport, co-operative marketing and
craft industries, combined with a direct attack on the
poverty of Europe’s distressed areas, will improve the
economy of agriculture and increase the markets for
its products.
It would be much better for a State that subsidises
its butter production for export to subsidise instead
domestic consumption. Most countries have made a
beginning with the policy of supplying cheap or free
milk, and interesting experiments of this kind are
being made by the Federal Surplus Commodities Cor-
poration in the United States. By such means Europe
could keep and increase her agricultural population,
spread health and vigor and help to relieve the prob-
lems that bewilder the producing nations overseas.

do some work for our own aerial defence under 18
months to two years. (2) That the British in refusing
peace are relying mainly on the United States to fur-

At least one reason for the failure of Italian forces
in East Africa to make sustained drives against the
British is the shortage of military supplies there.
Britain caught two supply ships in the Red Sea at
the time Italy entered the war, and since then the
Italians have had little luck maintaining a supply
flow. A few officers and pilots and some vital aircraft
parts have been flown 1600 miles across the Sudan, and
some war material has been smuggled across the Red
Sea from Arabia in native boats. Also, since the
Rome-Berlin-Tokyo pact, at least one Japanese ship
has put in at Italian Somaliland. None of these
methods, however, has got sufficient gasoline, guns,
etc., to the colonies to permit Italian forces
there to take important action. — ‘‘Newsweek,”

find its inspiration in the past, but a culture
that only looks back, that has neither vitality

any value it will seize this opportunity to erect

Russia and Germany are solidly hand in hand,
and nothing but the success or defeat of the present
totalitarian plans will separate them. No military
diplomacy during this war has been able to compare
with that of Stalin for sheer cunning and duplicity.
This ability to fool all with whom you are dealing is
the very essence and secret of Stalin’s rise to power.

It is of immense importance that new minds,

should take a leading man from the Dominions who
knows what “Dominion status” means, how the thing
works, and what qualities of political wisdom and of
toleration are required by those who work it. With a

Despite reiterated British statements that the

RACING REVIEW
(Conducted by "PILOT")
Rosehill attracted an excellent attend-
ance on Saturday, and the racing was in-
teresting without giving any strong
pointers as to probable results of more
important races at Randwick. Veteran
Red Thespian and Tusculum came out
best in that respect.
Forestage outpaced and outjumped
most of his Maiden Hurdle opponents
Larwood was his nearest follower
for seven furlongs, and, though Wind-
jammer got his head in front for a few
strides at the half-mile, Forestage had
his measure from the three furlongs, even
though he won by only half a length. It
must be added that Windjammer’s rider
was handicapped by a foot slipping out
of a stirrup at the last jump. Gold Pan
finished fast in third place, and will prob-
ably make a better hurdler than the two
that beat him. Of the unplaced lot
Battle Star did best, but there is hope for
Woolooga and Four All.
In the Nursery Handicap Linemond
acted up to the form he showed when
he won at Randwick, and though he had
to be hard ridden to join Milanja and
Belle Doree in the straight he was much
too good for them over the final furlong.
Like most of Veilmond’s progeny he has
plenty of white about him, and, though
tall, does not carry much flesh. How-
ever, he looks a colt that would improve
in that respect with age.
As Belle Doree, who ran third, is by
Medieval Knight from Golden Curio, it
is not surprising she can gallop. She did
the pacemaking, and will improve. Leggy
Lord Denis was fourth, and others that
shaped promisingly were Pagan (Grand
Mogul-Love Lake), Tidor (a well-grown
brother to Tidal Wave, and a 850gns.
yearling), True Mettle (Constant Son-
Mistletoe) and Fort Morgan (Melfort-
Gold Mast). There was money for Pick-
pocket, but she missed the jump-out, and,
ahead of only three or four at the end of
the first furlong, was not afterwards a
possibility. Her failure can be overlooked
to some extent.
Amateurs do not get many chances in
N.S.W. nowadays, but there was a full
supply available for the Corinthian Cup,
and, as a whole, little fault could be
found with their horsemanship. At dif-
ferent times we have had “professional
amateurs who, only for weight standing
in the way, would have made their mark
in the professional ranks.
Captain Gore and Sioneel were so far
ahead of most of their followers coming
to the turn that it looked as if one or the
other would win. Sioneel was first to
feel the strain, and in the last furlong
Captain Gore was unequal to stalling off
Merton, ridden by N. Windle, a brother
of the professional of that name. Sap-
phire Blue, who was slow to commence,
and then finished wide out, was a close
third, with Sioneel and Rossjoy heading
the remainder. The last-named did not
shape nearly as well as followers of F.
McGrath’s stable anticipated, but the
fact of being so greatly fancied suggests
he should be worth another bet when he
next runs. Although the field was large,
there seemed no chance of the winner
coming from anything outside Captain
Gore, Sioneel and Merton after the home
turn was reached.
Red Thespian has done a lot of racing
recently, but his win in the Dundas Han-
dicap demonstrated it had not done him
any harm. Delmestor and Early Bird
were slightly in advance of Valve, Grand
Boy and Rodborough at the three fur-
longs, but, though Valve and Early Bird
led after turning into the straight, Red
Thespian had the race won half a fur-
long from home.
Without having any chance against the
winner, Adios ran on well to get second,
with Early Bird half a neck away, and
not more than a head in advance of
Valve. Pen and Table Talk followed
after a gap. Early Bird, who could not
have looked better, was going comfort-
ably approaching the turn, but her finish-
ing effort was weak. Geebung made such
an indifferent showing that his return to
the winning list would still seem a long
way off, but though Rodborough dropped
out after turning for home he is likely
to improve with each race, and should
add to his winning record before summer
racing is over. Snow Queen is another
worth keeping in mind.
Tusculum, under his light weight,
finished too strongly for Yours Truly in
the December Handicap. The latter
bowled along very freely in the early
part, but though he shook off Malagigi
when the latter closed on him at the
three furlongs he could not withstand
Tusculum’s challenge. Bronze Flight was
fourth, but never quite looked a possible
place-getter, and Peerless did no better
than at Victoria Park earlier in the week.
A little while ago a return to her Maori-
land form seemed possible, but her last
two runs suggest that she has gone off
again.
Prominent from barrier-rise and first
into the straight in the Carlingford Mile,
Bonny Loch was a little too good for
Veiled Witch. A hundred yards from
home the latter seemed to have a fair
chance of catching Bonny Loch, but the
latter, aided by Munro’s vigorous riding,
held her off. Mainlaw was the closest of
thirds, with Irak, Dollar and Bourbon
almost on terms with him, and Dollar’s
finishing run was good enough to give
him a winning chance when he tackles a
distance beyond a mile.
Willie Green, Bestop, Rival Chief and
Überous found the early pace a trifle
too lively to permit of their seeing the
mile right out, though Rival Chief and
Bestop were well placed in the early part,
as were Aranui and Fancy Free.
* * * *
Improving considerably on his latest
form, Companion won his first race for
10 months when he beat Keelie and
Pannade in the Ascot (Vic.) Cup on
Saturday. He could not get out of his
own way in the Ballarat Cup, run nine
days earlier, but was always close to the
lead at Ascot, hit the front near the
three furlongs and cleared away to win by
four lengths in time only a quarter of
a second outside the course record for
H mile 40 yards. He was not allowed to
run unbacked, his price firming from
fifteens to twelves, and probably his im-
proved form was due in a measure to the
vigorous tactics adopted by rider Neville
Percival. Latter made the horse do his
best.
Companion has always given the im-
pression that he would develop fair stay-
ing form. By Night Raid, sire of Phar
Lap and Nightmarch, he finished third
in the last Australian Cup, but his only
two wins prior to Saturday were recorded
in middle-distance Trial company at
Moonee Valley. Apparently he needed
time, as he has struck his best form
at five years. Roley Trihey, trainer and
part-owner of Companion, was not at
Ascot to see him win. He was taken
ill at Ballarat and left hospital only on
Saturday morning, but listening-in to a
broadcast description of the race should
have acted as a good tonic. Companion
races in the colors made famous by
Regular Bachelor, also owned by Trihey,
and now at the stud.
Keelie, backed from 6 to 1 to 7 to 2,
made a game attempt to improve on his
second in the corresponding race last
year, but Companion was too good.
Keelie has been unlucky with successive
seconds in the Epsom and Ascot Cups,
and a win for him would not be out
of its turn. Pannade failed to stay.
Favorite at 11 to 4 on the strength of
three successive wins over shorter dis-
tances, he had the run of the race, but
was under the whip at the turn, and
only plodded into third place, six and a
half lengths behind the winner. Presum-
ing that apprentice F. Duffy was in-
structed to give Counsel plenty of time
to settle down, he seemingly overdid his
instructions. Counsel was tailed off a
hopeless last at the half-mile, and con-
ceded altogether too much start. He
beat three or four horses home.
Aspire’s success in the Lincolnshire
Handicap had an unhappy sequel for his
connections. He kicked Kanuri while
lining up for the start, and stewards sub-
sequently informed owner G. L. Scott that
no barrier position will be drawn for
Aspire at future meetings in the suburban
radius. He will be placed outside a
hurdle on the outside of the field. Scott
may have been unlucky, as action could
well have been taken against other horses,
in addition to Aspire and Footmark, in
comparatively recent weeks, but the
epidemic of kicking must be stamped out
as far as possible. In any case, Aspire’s
outside position is unlikely to prejudice
his chances at Flemington during the
holiday meetings. Recent results indicate
that the outside of the straight six is as
fast as the inside.
Backed from sixes to fours, Aspire
occupied the box-seat behind Bow Tie
to the turn, hit the front soon after
straightening up, and won decisively from
Pamelus and Bow Tie. He was having
his first race since being taken over by
trainer Theo Lewis following his defeat
by Cushla Machree at Moonee Valley
two weeks earlier. No disagreement lay
behind his removal from R. Webster’s
stable. Webster trained him at Paken-
ham, a provincial course, but Aspire was
not a good float traveller, and was apt
to arrive in the city on race days in a
nervous condition. On one occasion he
skinned himself rather badly. This
nervous tension probably accounted for
his weakening right at the end of his
races, and his owner decided that it would
be better to have him trained in the city.
Aspire races only at metropolitan meet-
ings, and now he is able to walk to the
various courses from his training estab-
lishment at Flemington. Saturday’s result
proved the experiment a success, Aspire
not “turning a hair” on his short walk
to Ascot.
Pamelus, at the age of nine, may not
be as good as formerly, but there is still
plenty of life in him. Ahead of only
two horses coming to the turn, and
forced to make his run on the extreme
outside, he finished strongly only a length
behind Aspire. Bow Tie had every
chance, and no excuse was possible for
Cushla Machree, who did not display the
same finishing ability that had enabled
her to beat Aspire at Moonee Valley.
Denis Girl ran home well in fourth posi-
tion, and a race over seven furlongs or
a mile should suit her nicely, while Black
Legend did well to finish fifth after a
slow start.
Because a Christmas hamper valued at
five guineas went with the prize for his
success in the Pakenham Cup two days
earlier, Contact was ineligible to contest
the second Pembroke Trial division. For-
tunately, his connections had also
accepted with him for the Berkeley
Welter, and Contact, penalised 41b. for
his provincial win, justified his 11-to-8
favoritism by beating Lalmoni and High
Falutin in a field of seven. First prize
of £l4O was twice that of the Trial
division, and Contact was backed down
from 5 to 2. He joined the pacemaker,
Aladale, on the turn, and stalled off a
challenge by Lalmoni, who is returning to
her best form. Contact was one of the
horses imported from England by Frank
Bullock, now in India, and was bought
by his present owner, Leonard Wight, for
350 guineas in August. Now trained by
ex-jockey J. Antonio, he gave the latter
his first training triumph in the metro-
politan area.
Three Ascot winners represented the
first horses raced by their respective
owners. They were Winterset, owned by
Leo O’Brien, Lawlove, by Mrs. W. O’Shea,
and Contact. Winterset won races on the
flat for his breeder, Sol Green, but
several months ago he was sold to
O’Brien, a bookmaker and a brother of
bookmaker Eddie O’Brien. Like the
latter’s horses, Winterset is trained
by Steve Murphy. Winterset was
always an odds-on favorite on the strength
of his easy win on the flat at Ballarat
10 days earlier, but his backers had
some uneasy moments when Greenthorne
made a duel of it over the last five fur-
longs. Winterset, however, had a little
too much pace on the flat, and eventually
went away to win by two lengths. It
was his first win over hurdles, but, with
more experience, he should have no
difficulty in paying his way in better
company. The chances are that he will
be put to steeplechasing next winter.
Lawlove, winner of the Mallacoota
Handicap, was bought privately by Mrs.
O’Shea after she had failed to reach her
reserve at auction. Although Lawlove
is the first horse raced by Mrs. O’Shea,
latter is a member of a racing family.
Her husband is well known in the light-
harness sport, and has a modern private
trotting track near Dandenong. Roy
Roach, trainer of the filly, is one of
several versatile men who successfully
mix the preparation of trotters and
gallopers. Many noted trotters have
been trained by Roach, who now owns
and drives the crack young pacer
Admirer, while his galloping winners in-
clude Request and Gee Whiz, in addition
to Lawlove. Last-named, though backed
from 9 to 2 to 7 to 2, started only
third best to Leicester Square and Eolian.
Racing up to Leicester Square approach-
ing the turn, she finished too strongly
for the favorite, and won in a style which
indicates further improvement. As her
name suggests, she is a daughter of Law
Maker.
• •••••
Leicester Square was galloped on dur-
ing the race, and had some skin stripped
from one of his hind legs. That may
have accounted for his inability to put
more fight into his finish, but in any case
he impresses as a colt who might require
a little time. Gallant Son, a 190-guinea
J. R. Smith colt, ran on fairly in third
place, but Eolian disappointed. There

was an excuse for Eolian, however. She
was knocked back last early, and it was
not surprising that she weakened into
fourth position after going round the
field to be third at the turn.
Kevastar, winner of the last Australian
Hurdle Race, broke down during the run-
ning of the Pembroke Trial, and his
owner is not hopeful of the gelding stand-
ing another preparation. Kevastar was
being trained for hurdle races at the holi-
day meetings. His breakdown is regret-
table, as Melbourne cannot afford to lose
good’ jumpers, but Kevastar’s place may
be taken later by Olorus, winner of Satur-
day’s race. Olorus, a five-year-old entire
by Thracian, has never raced over
hurdles, but, according to owner-trainer
T. J. Johnson, he schools particularly
well, and is a natural jumper. Maybe he
will be put to hurdling during the winter
months, but meantime he is able to pay
his way on the flat. His success on Satur-
day was hjs third from his last six starts.
Always second favorite, he led practi-
cally all the way, and, fighting on well
after turning for home with a clear lead,
beat the favorite, Star Boarder, by a head.
Request recorded a good performance
to finish third under 9.9, as he was forced
to cover extra ground on the turn.
Royal March looked all over a winner
when he shot through to a clear lead
soon after entering the straight for the
second Pembroke Trial division, but
Sugarmagundi, ridden desperately by Vic
Hartney, snatched a head win in the last
stride. It was an attractive performance,
as Sugarmagundi dropped back last near
the turn. Now seven years old, he raced
originally at picnic meetings, and was
leased by trainer H. Leek about a year
ago. He has won several races for Leek,
but is a lazy customer, whose habit of
dropping back in the early stages has pre-
judiced his chance more than once in a
large field. By Salmagundi from a Mag-
pie mare, he is bred to stay, and a subur-
ban middle-distance handicap should be
within his scope. Livingstone, favorite
for Saturday’s race, ovecame difficulties
to finish a good third. Slow away, he
was last for the greater part of the trip,
and had to be taken to the outside at the
turn.
* * * *
High Title, one of Melbourne’s main
hopes against All Love and Yaralla in
the important juvenile races next autumn,
will have his next race at Flemington on
Boxing Day, followed by the Stradbroke
Stakes on the same course on New Year’s
Day. High Title won the Debutant
Stakes in impressive style at his only
start, but an injury prevented his oppos-
ing All Love in the Maribyrnong Plate.
He has picked up well, but it remains to
be seen whether he can pace it with the
Sydney speedsters.
* * * *
At the time of writing Rimveil is the
Villiers Stakes favorite, and it is practi-
cally certain he will hold his position.
Red Thespian and Feminist seem most
likely to challenge him, but it is improb-
able he will be deposed by either. It
may be asking a lot of a three-year-old
to win with weight-for-age, but Rimveil’s
recent form at a mile has been so good
that it is difficult to go beyond him. He
has the pace necessary to take up a good
position at an early stage, and even
against older horses the distance is well
within his compass.
Feminist at her best would be a
troublesome opponent, but, though she
is working well, another race may
be necessary to bring her to her top.
As Red Thespian was never better than
at present he must be included among
the possibilities. He will meet Adios
on the same terms as in the Dundas
Handicap at Rosehill last week, and,
while he should again beat him, Adios
appears to hold everything that finished
behind him on that occasion.
Bourbon may scarcely commence fast
enough, and though the fact of Bobby
being made favorite for a race at New-
castle last week points to his condition
being good he ran so badly that it is
difficult to stand him. Stylish is a smart
filly, but at a difference of only a pound
on the w.f.a. scale I expect Rimveil to
beat her. Hash is sure to give a good
account of herself. She saw the mile out
when she recently gave Tusculum 71b.
and a beating at Randwick, and I think
that distance now suits her better than
anything shorter.
Sweet Boleiro (7.1) is another mare
with a chance. At a difference of only
91b. in her favor she decisively beat
Bonny Loch at six and a half furlongs
at Victoria Park last week, and the latter,
on the strength of his Rosehill win, would
be accounted well treated in this race with
7.10. Still, figures would not give him a
better chance than Sweet Boleiro, though,
of course, it is not definite she will be
suited by a mile.
Marengo has done well since his failure
in the Warwick Welter, and, though he
will meet Breeze and Asnazu 31b. worse
than in that race, he should turn the
tables on them if he is in generous mood.
He spoilt his chance at his last start,
consequent on shifting about in the
straight. It was thought he would be ridden
by J. Thompson, but as Thompson will
be on Red Thespian it is probable Par-
sons will have the mount. Veiled Witch
ran well at Rosehill, but, though the lighter
scale should suit her, she does not read as
well as Sweet Boleiro, who was too good
for Bonny Loch at Victoria Park. Queen
Alwyne was the last winner with less than
7st., and of those below that mark Breeze
may be best this time.
The half-dozen from which I expect
the place-getters to come are Rimveil,
Marengo, Hash, Red Thespian, Breeze
and Feminist, with Rimveil the winner.
Rosehill running did not throw special
light on the probable result of the
Summer Cup. Malagigi discounted his
chance, as he did not finish as well as
Yours Truly, who drops 71b. against the
former’s 51b., and is likely to be helped
by the lighter scale. In Maoriland Yours
Truly did much better with less than Bst.
than anything above it, and when he won
a mile-and-a-quarter race at Randwick
in October he had 7.11.
Dewar continues the popular choice,
but it may trouble him, though he is an
improving horse, to beat Kurrawid for
one, even though he meets Kurrawid 61b.
better than when the latter recently beat
him. Kurrawid has won with 8.3 at
11 furlongs at Randwick, and was third
in the last Anniversary Handicap with
7.11, against his 7.0 of next week.
Although his latest racing has been at
much shorter distances than that of
the Summer Cup Bourbon is a stayer,
and as he has only 71b. more than when
second in a Melbourne Cup his success
would not be a great surprise. Gladynev
was a failure after his second in the
Caulfield Cup, but, as he is working well,
he may now be given preference to
Malagigi.
Lower down Tuckerbox, Fountain and
Tusculum are among those likely to meet
with support, as may Dollar if he runs
at all well at Randwick on Saturday. As
a possible stayer it may be counted
against him that he is by Winooka, but
there are exceptions to every rule.
Tuckerbox is a winner at 11 furlongs,
and one of his minor placings was third,
with 7.12, in the Power Handicap, won
by Marauder (8.3) at Caulfield.
Next week’s issue gives me the oppor-
tunity of further reviewing the prospects
of candidates, but at present I look to
Kurrawid, Yours Truly, Dewar, Gladynev
and Tuckerbox as a collection most likely
to shine.
* * * *
Last year there were half a dozen
runners for the December Stakes, and
Dark Elegance, trained by F. T. Cush and
starting at 2 to 1 on, won easily from
Rylstone and Flying Fox. A small field
is again certain, and Cush’s stable, repre-
sented by Yaralla, will again supply the
favorite. The chestnut will carry 71b.
penalty, but, as he is strong and well
grown, 8.12 should not greatly trouble
him. Some of his opponents are sure to
keep him moving in the early part, but
going upon the way he came home in
the Kirkham Stakes they will be troubled
to hold him over the final furlong
Linemond is also a good finisher, but,
as his two wins were achieved in com-
pany below next week’s class, he may not
prove equal to downing Yaralla at a
difference of only 71b. Kingsdale is un-
deniably smart, but his Nursery Handi-
cap win was not as impressive as that of
Yaralla in the Kirkham Stakes the same
afternoon. If he behaves himself at the
barrier, Final Victory may be the one to
give Yaralla most trouble. In his school-
ing lessons Final Victory does not mis-
behave, and if he jumps away well on
Saturday he is likely to make Yaralla do
his best, even though he may not beat
him. Against the 1200gns. he cost,
Yaralla has earned £1570, and a Decem-
ber Stakes win of £1125 will put him a
long way ahead of his purchase-money,
and give his owner further cause to con-
gratulate himself on the success of his
first venture as a yearling-buyer.
Beaulivre and Gold Salute have
finished their spell at Richmond, and are
now in G. Price’s stables. After Gold
Salute’s return from Melbourne it was
reported that owner A. E. Cooper pur-
posed training him, but if he had any
such intention he has deemed it advisable
to depart from it.
* * * *
Ensign is progressing as satisfactorily
as his admirers could wish, but, good as
he has shown himself, a win in the Car-
rington Stakes with 9.0 will be a stiff
task. His troublesome opponents will
include Waireka, to whom he is conceding
211 b. Although she disappointed on some
occasions, Waireka was brilliant last
season, and, though above herself, she
showed a lot of her two-year-old pace
when she recently ran third to Adios
and Pierce at Randwick. The interval
of three weeks should see her at her
best in the Carrington Stakes, in which
she will meet Adios 91b. better. Revert-
ing to Ensign’s weight, he has 21b. more
than High Caste, at the same age, success-
fully carried in the last Challenge Stakes.
* * * *
If time could always be relied on as
a guide to winners Rimveil’s mile and
27 yards in 1.38 with 9.8 at the recent
meeting at Randwick put him in a better
light than any other Villiers candidate
that ran the same afternoon. It was com-
paratively faster than Adios’s 1.13! in the
Camden Stakes and well ahead of the
1.26! recorded by the Warwick Welter
dead-heaters, Breeze and Asnazu. Rim-
veil’s time also worked out a quarter-
second a furlong better than Yaralla’s
1.2| in the Kirkham Stakes. Deduct-
ing a second and a half for the extra dis-
tance over a mile covered by Rimveil,
that would make his time equal to 1.36!
with 9.8, and as he will have 201 b. less
to carry it would not be too much to
expect him to get very close to Ramdin’s
record of 1.35! for the Villiers. How-
ever, while time is undeniably useful in
the comparison of present-day horses
with those of the past, it is anything but
an infallible guide to winners. Still, the
time he put up under a big weight said
a lot for Rimveil’s Villiers chance.
* * * *
At Rosehill the stipendiary stewards
warned jockeys that in future the grow-
ing practice of going in or out to meet
a horse that threatened danger would
bring a lot of trouble to offenders. It has
surprised me that some of our older
riders have escaped punishment for that
particular offence. The intention to
hinder a dangerous opponent was pal-
pable, and it often made me smile to
read subsequently that the horse was to
blame for running about. Almost need-
less to say that was the jockey’s explana-
tion. We hear apprentices blamed
for most of the trouble that happens in
races, but occasionally the more experi-
enced riders contribute to it in showing
points to the younger division, and the
latter deem it inadvisable to complain.
* * * *
The only horse that incurs a penalty
for the Summer Cup is the winner of
the Villiers Stakes, and it can be rehandi-
happed up to 101 b. In the circumstances
Holiday Handicap runners on Saturday
are sure to include many Summer Cup
candidates. Last year Santa won the
Holiday Handicap from Own Folk and
Breeze, and was beaten a neck by his
stable companion Bringa in the Summer
Cup, in which Own Folk was third.
* * * *
There were no divisions at Rosehill bn
Saturday, and as the club did not have
to go beyond its advertised prize-money
of £l2OO the meeting should have given
the club a satisfactory monetary return.
Commencing with next Saturday owners
will have four days’ racing for substantial
prize-money at Randwick. The A.J.C. is
giving £8950 for 13 races, and Tatter-
sail’s Club £6450 for 12. The other day
I asked an owner why he withdrew his
horse after accepting with it. “Nothing
amiss,” he replied, “but I can run at
Randwick jn similar company for more
than double the prize-money and am
sure of a better price.”
* * * *
New sires in Double Remove and
Brueghel have made a good start this
season, the former in particular, and it
is on the cards that next season Actor
will add to the number of imported suc-
cesses. If appearance, breeding and gal-
loping ability count he should certainly
do so. When trained by J. T. Jamieson
at Randwick he surprised that trainer
by beating the speedy Stretto over a
short course, and the latter was well
at the time. The fear that Actor might
not stand a preparation caused Jamieson
to return him to owner Sol Green, but
he was so much impressed by what Actor
had shown that he sent his mare Podokes
to him. Unfortunately she died before
foaling. Jamieson believes Actor would
have achieved great things in Australia
if all had gone well with him.
* * * *
Except in the case of rank outsiders
there is rarely much difference in book-
makers’ starting prices and totalisator
dividends. For instance, at Rosehill on
Saturday fields for most of the races
were large, and yet differences between
the tote and book were fractional in
four races. In their races the closing
quotes with the books against Linemond,
Red Thespian, Tusculum and Bonny
Loch were respectively 5 to 4, 5 to 2,
4to 1 and 5 to 1. The tote returns
for ss. were: Linemond, 11s. 3d.; Red
Thespian, 17s. 3d.; Tusculum, £1 ss. 6d. ;
and Bonny Loch, £1 ss. 6d. Backers
make their own prices on the machine,
and, in a great measure, seemingly do
so with the books where fancied horses
are concerned. Forestage’s tote return
was only a little more than a point
greater than the books offered, but the
machine gave nearly five points more
about Merton than could be obtained
from the books.
* * * *
Racing has been definitely abandoned
in England. Several fixtures that were
announced have been cancelled. In view
of the continuous bombing to which vari-
ous English cities are being subjected,
this is not surprising. When the late Sir
Abe Bailey’s horses were sold at the
beginning of this month it was reckoned
that the £45,000 they fetched was about
half the amount they would have realised
in normal times, but if the sale had been
delayed it is improbable they would have
sold nearly as well. As he already owns
several stallions, Lord Glanely must have
been optimistic as to the future when he
gave 5700 guineas for the stallion Tiberius
(son of Foxlaw) at the Bailey sale.
Unfortunately it seems as if it will be
many years before racing reaches its old
position in England.

Of interest to Australians is the fact
that Cottesmore, the best steeplechaser
in America this year, traces back to Aus-
tralian blood on the sire’s- side. He is by
Heverswood, a son of The Boss, who was
by Orby from Australian-bred Southern
Cross 11, by Meteor from Resplendent
(Splendor-Sophietina). Meteor won a
Hawkesbury Handicap in the ’eighties.
Cottesmore, who was bred in England,
had won four steeplechases in succession
up to the beginning of October, the latest
being the Belmont Park (New York)
Grand National Steeplechase of $14,850
for first. Cottesmore, who had 11.6, was
favorite at 2 to 1, and won in 5.51 J- over
a distance given as “about” three miles.
That, however, is on the slow side, com-
pared with Cheery Jack’s 5.28 for three
miles in the last V.R.C. Grand National
Steeplechase.

Several runners at Victoria Park are
worth remembering for coming meetings.
Winners in Tuhitarata and Sweet Boleiro
are sure to improve. The former, though
bright, scarcely looked at his top in con-
dition, and, as he is only five, he is not
too old to improve upon his second with
7.8 in the Epsom won by Geebung
(7.10). Sweet Boleiro will also get better,
as will Rylstone, winner of a division of
the Three and Four-year-old Handicap.
He has not greatly developed since last
season, but he is shapely, and may make
a stayer. It was with that idea R. F.
Moses gave a four-figure price for him
after he had shown good form at two
years. In running second in Rylstone’s
race Mabson did well, though I do not
agree with the idea that he was unlucky
not to have won. Widden is sure to
score again before long, and more racing
will benefit beaten runners in Tuckerbox,
Fountain, Tunic, Aren’t We All, High
Dividend, Many Ways, Good Morning,
Belle Rose, Loyal Lad and Alluring. On
top of his recent racing over longer dis-
tances in Melbourne, the owner of St.
Constant erred in trying to win a sprint
race, but still that horse ran sufficiently
well to suggest he is a winning possibility
at Randwick during the next few weeks.

Despite Beau Vite’s Australian wins
Royal Chief has to give him 51b. in the
Auckland Cup, of £3OOO, to be run on
Boxing Day. Royal Chief has 9.11, and
Beau Vite 9.6, respectively 51b. and 61b.
over weight-for-age. Old Bill, with 9.0,
is next to these two, and the fact that
nothing else has more than 8.3 proves
that Maoriland is numerically no better
off than Australia in respect of good
stayers. Gladynev and Round Up have
7.12, the latter being much better treated
than in Australia. He was weighted at
8.10 for the Metropolitan and Melbourne
Cup, and 8.12 for the Caulfield Cup. In
the six furlongs Railway Handicap, of
£lOOO, Nigger Boy is on top with 9.3,
a pound above Amigo. Four pounds
below the latter are Black Thread, Sulie-
man, Kathbella and Corata, so Maoriland
evidently has a number of smart sprinters
of much the same calibre.
* * * *
The yearling sales are already receiv-
ing attention, and breeders are speculat-
ing what effect the war is likely to have
on their catalogues. While the A.J.C.
and the other clubs racing at Randwick
and all the clubs in Melbourne con-
tinue to keep their stakes up to a high
standard, fair prices are certain, though
heavy taxation is bound to have some
effect. However, our breeders are in a
much better position than those of Eng-
land. Last season’s sales did not give
us many yearlings that have greatly dis-
tinguished themselves this spring. Yar-
alla (1200gns.) and All Love (250gns.)
stand out from others of the Sydney-
trained youngsters. It is certain, how-
ever, there will be developments before
Melbourne and Sydney autumn meetings
are over. Nevertheless, the fact of only
two of the many hundreds sold showing
really high-class spring form in Mel-
bourne or Sydney gives a fair idea of
the luck necessary in yearling-buying, no
matter how alluring pedigrees or relation-
ship to prominent horses may be.
* * * *
The war has not adversely affected
racing in India. Importations of horses
from England last year were numerous,
and in a letter I recently received from
Calcutta it was mentioned that at the
nine days’ meeting which commenced
there on November 23 attendances on
the first two were much larger than on
the corresponding days last year.
Runners were unusually plentiful, and
A. Higgins must have gone close to
establishing a world’s record for a trainer
when his stable provided six of the 16
starters for the Arthur Plate, a seven-
furlongs handicap, carrying £7OO first and
£2OO second money. Furthermore, Hig-
gins had the satisfaction of winning with
Earnest (6 to 1) and running second with
Let Slip (8 to 1). His other runners
were Respirator, Panaster, Winning Lot
and Martara. Earnest, ridden by the
Brisbane boy Harris, defeated the late-
coming Let Slip only a head.
In addition to Harris, Australian
jockeys successful on the first two days
included Stead and Treffone. Stead won
the Hilliard Plate on Good Fare (easily
beating Baqlava), and, as that race is
generally regarded as a pointer for the
King-Emperor’s Cup, a profitable season
for the ex-Sydney jockey seems possible.
Touching on racing in India, the treble
tote is very popular there. At Bombay
on November 30 only one backer selected
the winning treble, and his return was
£2773 (R 536,974). It is not stated
whether tickets were Rss (7s. 6d.) or
Rsls, but in either case it was a great
return. At Calcutta on the same date
three backers who picked the winning
treble each received £1326. Winners of
two of the races were favorites, but the
other was a rank outsider.
Many Australian horses have won the
Viceroy’s Cup at the Calcutta meeting,
but now England completely overshadows
us in supplying India with stayers. For
this year’s Viceroy’s Cup is R 555,000,
Respirator is the only Australian-bred
entrant. He is also the only horse from
this part of the world engaged in the
King-Emperor’s Cup, another R 555,000
race.
M.Q. and Rafferty
Westbury v. McLaughlin
It looked as if Alan Westbury, the
Newcastle contender for the Australian
welter title, would win this Leichhardt
fight, anyhow, so it was a pity he had to
win on a decision wide open to dispute.
He had a bit the better of the first
round, though his tactics were of a sort
to suit Ron McLaughlin perfectly —he
was going in to that dour fighter and
mixing it, instead of boxing the ears off
him as he has the ability to do. As a
result, Westbury stopped some needless
punishment. The tactics may have been
a result of Westbury being a bit out of
condition. He went 10.8| (heavy for
him) to McLaughlin’s 10.5 L and may
have thought an early end would be
prudent.
Still mixing it in the second, Westbury
got in some weighty two-handed body
salvoes, but McLaughlin scored well with
each hand to the jaw and side of the
head—heavy punches that proved West-
bury’s toughness, if nothing else. The
round was McLaughlin’s.
The third Westbury won handsomely.
Moving in very fast, and not lingering
there, as he had unwisely been doing,
he landed a weighty inside right which
cut McLaughlin’s left eye and shook him,
following that up with a terrific left hook
and a violent two-handed battering to
the body. McLaughlin survived this
onslaught without visible distress, and
fought back spiritedly.
The fourth round was magnificent. It
opened with a few seconds of the best
stand-take-and-give fighting seen for
many a day. Each stood up to deadly
hitting, Westbury winning the clash. They
sparred for breath, then went into it
again ; more splendid stand-up punching,
with all they had behind it. This time
McLaughlin had the better of it, but
Westbury, resorting to boxing, scored
smartly over the rest of the round and
won it, though McLaughlin caught him
with one clinking right to the jaw and
another a bit higher just near the end.
The fifth round began and progressed as
a comparative lull. With every good reason,
both had eased up ; hitting heavily, but
most of the time wary and evasive. Still,
it was tense enough to suggest that they
would be fighting furiously again at any
second. So all present believed and ex-
pected, and, there being a crowded house
present, the din as the round ended was
overwhelming. It was such a thunderous
row, rising up from the close ringside to
the outermost bleachers, that Westbury
certainly could not be held wholly to
blame for what happened.
All very well for the howling mob to
bawl murder at him. They could see
the clock and were expecting the bell ;
they were kicking up the devil’s own
row ; and, moreover, they were not there
in the ring fighting, and hadn’t had their
hearing apparatus in the way of any of
McLaughlin’s heavy wallops. On the
other hand, it’s a reasonably loud bell
they now have installed at Leichhardt.
McLaughlin evidently heard it all right.
Accordingly, he dropped his gloves,
turned, and moved into his corner. Thus
standing, he stopped a blow to the side or
back of his neck which Westbury had to
dart forward a couple of yards to deliver,
and which dropped McLaughlin in a
heap.
Westbury went back to his corner, and
the din got worse than ever. McLaughlin
was apparently helpless, sprawling on his
seat, with several of his corner support-
ing him, and a barracker up in the ring,
held back against the ropes by a couple of
corner hands, heaving variegated calumny
and contumely at the Westbury side. The
bell sounding the end of the noisy rest in-
terval, ref. Pearson beckoned the contest-
ants to the fray, and, as only Westbury
came forward, Mr. Pearson declared him
the winner.
It was hard luck all round. Hard on
McLaughlin, who, though he may not
have won, would, as usual, have made a
tough fight of it. Possibly he should have
got the decision, bell or no bell, for
being hit in a spot which even bung rules
place out of bounds. However, it would
have been just as hard on Westbury to
have lost. He was leading at the time
and looking fairly certain of winning.
If the decision in the main scrap can
be held open to discussion, it would be
hard to give a polite description of one
declared by prelim, ref. Elliott. This
was in the return bantam bout, Jack
Crowley v. Tarzan Davis. In their pre-
vious encounter Crowley won narrowly.
This time he appeared to win every
round. Decision to Tarzan. First re-
action from the jungle, loud roars of
incredulous laughter, followed by bellows
of wrath as it dawned on the denizens
that it wasn’t merely a mistake of geo-
graphy but the final decision.
The main 10-round prelim., Archie
Rash (9.4) v. Joe Grant (9.3), went the
full distance, and, without running to
fireworks, was a particularly nice scrap
to watch all the way. Archie won it,
mainly because Joe couldn’t put his usual
snap into his punching. Probably the
best has been seen of Archie ; a strong,
game, awkward scrapper, always hard
to beat. Joe is steadily improving; as
neat a boxer as there is about; game,
and, when he has it working well, pos-
sessor of a pretty left hand.
As the printer was reaching out for
these pages Ron Richards and Fred
Henneberry were due to shape up in
Sydney Stadium ring for another of their
meetings for the middleweight title.
Nineteenth Hole
By JIM FERRIER.
o Open and Amateur Champion of Australia,
now touring the United States.)
. While in Chicago I was invited to play
at Mill-road Farm. Up to this year it
had only one member—its owner, A. D.
Lasker, the millionaire golfer. It lies
on three sides of his home, 30 miles
north of Chicago. Early this year Lasker
gave the course to the University of
Chicago unconditionally.
From a championship standpoint the
course has no superior in the United
States. Of the many courses I have
visited during my trip, Augusta
in Georgia, where the Masters’ Tourna-
ment is held, and Mill-road Farm are the
finest I have seen or played on. Measur-
ing 7001 yards, Mill-road Farm is the
only course besides Augusta where
bunkers are placed to catch the long
hitter as well as the average player.
Lasker once offered any player,
amateur or professional, 500 dollars
if he could break 70 against the
par of 72. His offer stood for several
years till Tommy Armour returned a
69. Gene Sarazen spent a week on the
course, playing it twice daily, and his
only two rounds under par were 70 and
71. In addition to spending up to
£lO,OOO each year on his course,
Lasker paid Dick Metz, who beat me for
this year’s Chicago open championship,
a substantial salary to play with him and
his friends.
Mill-road Farm has seven par-fours
from 400yds. to 470yds., which call for
long drives and powerful iron play ; two
of the par-three holes are 210yds. and
215yds. in length, while it is impossible
even for the longest hitters to reach the
two par-five holes. Starting off with
holes of 438yds., 440yds. and 210yds., the
player must be in his best form.
Some idea of the course can be
obtained from the fact that my partner
—also a visitor —a normal 87 to 89 player
on his home course, took 101, while our
opponents, on handicaps of six and 15,
took 84 and 97. My 73 included only
one error. Much of the course’s diffi-
culties can be traced to modern bunker-
ing and superb green construction. In
many ways Mill-road Farm is very similar
to Metropolitan and Royal Melbourne ;
its fairways also are tree-lined.
The 10,000-dollar New Orleans open
championship has been abandoned for
1941. Sponsored by a welFknown
political group, which provided the prize-
money, the event was the outstanding one
during the tour of the Southern States.
This year, however, the party was
defeated at the polls, and is unable to
conduct the tournament.
Ins and Outs
The S.A. team that couldn’t scrape
together 200 runs in two attempts at
Sydney knocked up 515 v. Victoria at
Melbourne. Badcock got 120, Ham-
ence 130 and Leak 79. But the bowl-
ing wasn’t much chop. Grimmett got
two wickets early for S.A., but Lee (93),
Miller (63) and Hassett (67) helped things
along. With seven wickets down for 317
Grimmett had taken six.
* * * *
Arthur and Vic Richardson, who played
together for S.A. and for Australia (they
are not related), now have a son each in
district cricket in Adelaide. Vic is still
batting for Sturt, with his young Douglas,
but Arthur is content to coach East
Torrens, for which his Brian plays.

“Dick Tafone”: Sixteen defendants
who faced the Brisbane Police Court for
breaches of the City Council’s water
restrictions gazed ruefully at the torren-
tial rain outside as they waited their
turns to be set back a quid and costs
apiece. All day it thundered down, the
gurgling of roof gutters and downspouts
making it difficult to hear proceedings in
the court. Weeks of drought had elapsed
since the original offences, gardens had
drooped and died, but the Law took its
relentless course regardless of such
matters. As one embittered miscreant
remarked to a fellow-sufferer: “Cripes,
they might have adjourned it to a fine
day! ”
* * * *
“Nagheer”: Queensland’s Transport
Commissars decided to add to the festi-
vity of the Christmas season by charging
a special fee of 10s. on all buses which
run in Toowoomba on Christmas Eve.
With this coming on top of the commis-
sion’s extortionate imposts for registra-
tion and licensing, cost of overtime for
drivers under State industrial legislation,
increased cost of petrol and other recent
additional expenses, bus proprietors have
decided that it will not be worth while
to run. Deprived of its Christmas Eve
shopping unless it owns a car or has a
friend who does, the Toowoomba vote-
fodder has raised a howl which may yet
be heard by the Brisbane heads now plan-
ning for the State general election to be
held early in 1941.
“Balander”: Another road-transport
edict to protect business that is officially
regarded as “belonging” to the Govern-
ment railways affects goods water-
borne to Caloundra, Coolum Beach,
Mooloolaba and Noosa Heads. After
being unloaded from the boat, goods
may not now be carried by road for more
than five miles from the post offices of
those centres. Hitherto the radius was
15 miles. The Government railway
parallels the coast practically to Noosa
Heads, roughly inside 10 miles from the
sea, and the new restriction is obviously
aimed at preventing ships carrying goods
consigned to other than coastal addresses.
Thus, at a time when a development of
coastal shipping would be welcomed by
the nation a State Commission puts a
stop to it in a back-handed sort of way
without reference to Parliament.
* * * *
“McSkirler”: Ann Crawford, M.A.,
was teaching in Lithuania when the
Mighty Red Army marched in, and has
since arrived in Queensland among the
refugees who had to trek halfway round
the world to get out. She saw the Soviet
hosts as “a rabble army —no dis-
cipline, no uniforms, no worth-while
equipment; their tanks rotten, their
’planes out of date.” Adding that tinned
pineapple was 11s. a tin in Lithuania
after the Russkis’ advent, she went on
to say that as she had no relatives or
close friends in the place she wasn’t
afraid to speak her mind. Her remarks
came out on the same day that the Bris-
bane Trade Union Congress carried by
34 to 26 a motion urging the lifting of
the ban on the Australian (?) Communist
party, described by McHugh, of the
A.R.U., as the “advanced thinking section
of the Labor movement.” McHugh ought
to have a yarn with Miss Crawford.
* * * *
“Poi-poi”: When Townsville suffered
a temporary blackout during the coal
strike it little knew the cause, which
would have delighted the man who wrote
“The Iliad of Sandy Bar.” An
engineer and a fireman at the local
powerhouse had not spoken to each
other for seven years, though fre-
quently sharing shifts. The powerhouse
was using wood in the absence of coal
and a big log got jammed in the
firebox. The engineer noticed the falling
pressure, but wasn’t speaking to the fire-
man, so turned on the draught. The
fireman knew the log had stuck but
couldn’t talk to the engineer. He tried
to get it out, the pressure kept on falling
and the lights failed in part of the city,
including the General Hospital. When
the council found out about the men’s
quarrel it decided to punish both and re-
moved the fireman to another job. This
wasn’t congenial to him and his union
held that he should get his former job
back. The Court ordered a conference
(of council and union, not fireman
and engineer), meanwhile reserving its
decision.

“Port Hedland”: Old-timers out
Marble Bar (W.A.) way have put their
radiators away and are looking forward
to a nice, warm summer. For the first
eight days in December, the mean maxL
mum temperature was llOdeg. and
114 deg. was hit. That, of course, is not
really hot for Marble Bar. The oldest
inhabitant can tell you about the good
old days when you cooked your break-
fast eggs by cracking them on a shovel
which had been held out in the early-
morning sun for a minute or two. And,
of course, he still luxuriates in the
memory of 1921-22, when the mercury
climbed above lOOdeg. for over 100 days.
* * * *
“Lid”: Sharks and crocodiles have
been seen and/or killed in Darwin
Harbor recently, but the other day a
shark nearly turned the tables on a
soldier. Emptying a fishtrap of its haul
in three feet of water, the warrior found
a shark also in the trap. His cobbers
fired a couple of .303 bullets into it with-
out effect; then it attacked their mate,
who tried to ward it off with an abo. fish-
spear. His companions carted him off
for hospital attention
and then returned and
disposed of the shark.

“23-4”: The Cour-
tice family, of Bunda-
berg, must hold some-
thing like a Queens-
land record for scho-
-las t i c achievement,
Eldest son Colin was
the 1933 Rhodes
scholar —in 1937 he
got brilliant passes in
his final exams, in
London, with the
diplomas L.R.C.P. and
M.R.C.S. Daughter
Phyllis won an open
scholarship to the
Queensland Univer-
sity, graduated M.A.
and was appointed to
the University library.
Another daughter is
now at the University
on an open scholar-
ship, and young
Robert has graduated
B.Sc. there, and col-
lected a Walter and
Eliza Hall travelling
scholarship that will
take him to Java on
research into tropical
climate and settle-
ment. In 1936 the
young man won the
Taff Memorial for the
most meritorious first
year in medicine at the
University. They’re
the sort of people that
justify free and com-
pulsory education.

“Ex-Mister”: Com-
ing up to the Bris-
bane River entrance the lookout man on
a coastal steamer hurriedly hailed the
bridge to report a house afloat off the
port bow. It was, too —a six-roomed
residence, complete with glass windows
glittering in the first rays of the sun and
making a steady four-knot south-easterly
course apparently under its own power.
A blanket of low fog on the calm water
hid both the sand barge on which it rested
"A good thing We jumped , Paddy !”
and the motor-boat which was towing it.
The house had been sold for removal
from the site of the new slip at Kangaroo
Point, skidded down the river bank for
50 yards or so and made fast on the
barge for transport to Southport, 60-odd
miles away. On arrival it was skidded
ashore and on to the stumps prepared for
it, and is expected to be in occupation by
Christmas.


HAPPY RELIEF
FROM PAINFUL
RACKACHE
Many of those gnawing, nagging, gainful
backaches people blame on colds or strains
are often caused by tired kidneys—and can be
rJ'cved when treated in the right way.
The kidneys are Nature’s chief way of tak-
T 'g excess acids and poisonous waste out of
l a blood. Most people pass about 3 pints a
i_. y or about 3 pounds of waste.
If the 15 miles of kidney tubes and Alters
don’t work well, poisonous waste matter stays
in the blood. These poisons may cause fre-
quent and scanty passages with smarting and
burning, nagging backaches, rheumatic pains,
loss of pep and energy, getting up nights,
swelling, puffiness under the eyes, headaches
and dizziness.
Don’t wait I Ask your chemist or store for
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS, used
successfully by millions for over 40 years.
They give happy relief and will help the 15

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Noel Coward returns to Sydney
this week, and tomorrow (19th) he will
give a helping hand to King George’s
Fund for Sailors. To aid these men, who
are scouring the North Sea and the
North Atlantic keeping the waterways
open to British trade and British free-
dom, there’s to be a sort of super cock-
tail party at Redleaf (the new address of
Mrs. A. A. Hall, formerly of Elizabeth
Bay House). Mr. Coward will pop in
and sing a few songs somewhere between
five and seven. Tickets are one guinea
each, and can be had from Mrs. Hall, or
Ihe secretary, King George’s Fund for
Sailors, 4 Bridge-street, Sydney.
Sydney has a new theatre movement.
It is named the Phoenix (and may it rise
brilliant and triumphant from the ashes
of the drama-lovers’ dead hope!), and its
director is Frederick Hughes. As a very
young boy he appeared in the Sir Her-
bert Tree co. and Lewis Waller’s cos. in
London. He has acted and produced
with the J. C. Williamson firm and with
Sydney’s old friend Gregan McMahon.
But what is to Australia the vital point
in the Phoenix productions is that Mr.
Hughes is determined to give stage-space
to the Australian drama. To prove this
he is staging for his next production
Harry Tighe’s “Intrigue,” a French play
of the Louis IV period. Quite rightly,
Mr. Hughes believes that the Australian
dramatist should not keep his imagina-
tion cooped up in his own country. If
England had decreed that, how plucked
an eagle would Will Shakspeare or Kit
Marlowe have been!
There <vas a red frock that burned
like a ruby at the first play the Phoenix
parked at the Conservatorium. Its flow-
ing skirt was of chiffon, its bodice of
velvet. It made quite an entry.
Priestley’s play “The Roundabout”
brought an impressive array of cars,
petrol-proud, rushing up to the Con.
Harry Tighe brought a party, and
Mrs. A. G. Thomas came with her
pretty daughter-in-law and Margaret
Gillespie. Mrs. Hubert Fairfax brought
a good company ; so did Miss Jobson,
of Hopewood House. Harald Bowden, the
John Morts, Dr. Mary Booth, Kathleen
Robinson, Jeanie Ranken and the
Countess de Vilme-Hautmont were among
the noted. Elizabeth Ripley (who is Mrs.
Cuthbert Sheldon) made a good impres-
sion as Hilda Lancicourt.
Between one and two last Thursday
the city between the Showground and
George-street stood at gaze as armored
cars and guns drawn by tractors thun-
dered by in powerful procession. Power
harnessed by science got its message
home to the watching city, and showed
what was to be bought with that
£28,000,000 Freedom War Loan the Com-
monwealth was out to raise—and did.
When General de Gaulle comes to
Sydney he will receive a rousing welcome
at the headquarters of the Friends of
France. This group was founded by
poetess Ivy Moore long before the war
trumpets blew, and with one accord,
when the general set up his standard as
opposed to that of Vichy, the members
declared themselves for Free France.
Last week, to keep the club funds
healthy, Mrs. Moore had a party at her
home in Mosman, and seventy guests
rapped the knocker of her door, which
was emblazoned for the occasion with
the Cross of Lorraine. This was drawn
in blue on a red ground, and proved
quite a stirring greeting.
With nearly four thousand others this
Letter tramped the stone passages and
stairs of the old medical school at the
University, science the object of the pur-
suit. The thirst for knowledge grew
more and more feverish as the number
of doors on which the sign “Lecture in
progress—No admittance” seemed to in-
crease. It was a full house where Mr.
Wills was playing battledore and shuttle-
cock with liquid air, so a quiet rumina-
tion in the egg and cheese department
was a good pastime. The food value of
a lump of butter would surprise you.
Eggs, too, seem to bear out the old asser-
tion that “an egg is full of meat.” The
proteins and fat values of a lump of steak
were made public. However, no wit had
given the fat or bone content of guns.
Did you know that 95 p.c. of your
body is made up of oxygen, hydrogen,
nitrogen and carbon —“the big four” of
chemistry? The other chemical elements
which make you a human being are
found in the ash which remains after
burning the body. There was no body
burned to prove this last Saturday after-
noon, so it remains for one visitor just
a matter of scientific hearsay. The ex-
positors covered a vast field in their lec-
tures and exhibits. There were skulls of
primitive man, his weapons, his art and
his music. There were X-ray films, in-
sect studies, glass-working. There were
birds, fish and reptiles from the Austra-
lian Museum. In short, there was every-
thing, including refreshments. The tak-
ings benefit the Halse Rogers lady’s fund
(University soldier comforts), the Mayor’s
Patriotic Fund, the Uni. Women’s War
Auxiliary Fund and the Society of Lab.
Technicians’ War Comforts Fund.
One of the city’s charmful spots during
the last ten days has been the toyshop
completely stocked by the women
cricketers with the work of their hands.
Special distinction goes to Mrs. E. Ogden.
When the idea of the shop to help the
child victims of the air raids in England
was decided on, each of the 16 teams
of girl cricketers was called on to supply
so many toys. Mrs. Ogden, with the
help of her mother, Mrs. Bloomfield,
made the whole 50 for the Cumberland
group. All the dolls’ swings, the hobby-
horses, the convoys in the shop have a
professional look, and the complete stock
is a credit to the makers. Photograph

Once more the George Duncans had
their before-Christmas party. To his sign
of the red lamp in Frenchman’s-road,
Randwick, came about 80 friends between
5.30 and 9.30 (this is a party that goes
on till midnight). In the late rain-washed
twilight the Lombardy poplar-lined
garden that, London fashion, stretches at
the back of the house was a cool and
pleasant sight after the heat of the day.
At first guests gathered on the awninged
terrace, and as the night drew in came
within doors to listen to Dr. de Mon-
chaux playing his own accompaniments
and singing old German songs, and then
(“to prove he wasn’t a Quisling”) doing
the same for old English songs of the
Herrick and Ben Jonson vintage.
Lurline Hammond, in blue organzas,
sang aria from opera and that song of
sentiment that is never sentimental, “The
Little Silver Ring.” Mrs. Patrick played
the accompaniments to her own mono-
logues and to her captain husband’s
famed sea-chanties. Nearly every man at
the party was a physician or a surgeon of
note. If anybody had developed a
refractory appendix the setting was per-
fect. It would have been all over and
done with before supper, and the patient
would probably have been eating the
meringue of convalescence with the coffee.
However, one and all remained healthy.
Law was represented by Mr. Justice
de Baun, who came with his Titian-
haired wife, and wings over Australia
by Flying-Officer Vautin. His wife
was one of the evening’s singers. Mrs.
Duncan’s twilight-blue chiffons with their
flower pattern were admired.. Jeanette
Paterson amused with her sketches.
Altogether Dr. Duncan and his wife pro-
duced another happy prelude to Christ-
mas. Medical Comforts (Vaucluse Branch)
benefited from the box in the hall and a
guessing competition, about £2O in all.
It will be a case of “painless” extraction
for patients lucky enough to have attrac-
tive Rosslyn (Patsy to her friends)
Griffiths, of Chatswood, for their dentist.
She has just completed her final year
in dentistry at Sydney Uni. Up to 1937
Patsy, who is the elder daughter of the
Dr. Ernest Griffiths couple, was at
Abbotsleigh, Wahroonga, and before that
she was a pupil of Creveen, Adelaide.
She is a keen skier and took part in
the inter-university contests of 1938.

Romano’s celebrated its first birthday
last Thursday night. The bright restau-
rant with the Fred Leist murals is really
18 months old, so the party was a bit
delayed. Everything there is pretty much
as it was in the beginning, except that
the grass-green carpet has been plucked
up, some say, in consideration for the
color schemes of the women guests’
frocking. There was a full house for the
dinner-dance, and Brian Lawrence played
all the favorite music, including “Prin-
cess Papoolay,” which pretty Joan Carr,
from Melbourne, ranks number one at
the moment. She was with a family party,
and wore a swish of white tulle spattered
in sequins.
The Ruthven family was there, Mrs.
Craven and Mrs. Buchanan were among
the night’s attractions. Mrs. lan Spencer’s
frock had the dull gleam of oxidised
silver. Carmen Nathan’s Hawaiian
prints had a sprightly air. The Morgan
Duncans, from Hawke’s Bay (M.L.),
were a notable couple. Her pomegranate-
pink chiffons wore white spots. Mrs.
Henry Charles Osborne and Pat Murray
were others who caught the gaze. At
midnight the electrics went out, and the
only light came from the candles on the
small birthday cake on each table. Then
came the cabaret turn —Marjorie Gordon
and Paul Vernon danced. Then the staff
presented host Romano with a gold pen,
after which he sang, everybody taking up
the refrain.
The Rupert Wilsons, of Oberon, are
looking forward to a centenary in the
family. It is just around the 1942 corner,
and then the Wilson property Fairview
will have been 100 years in the family.
Glasses were clinked to the happy and
peaceful celebration of this anniversary
in the Carlton lounge, and to the success
of the Wilson property Redfern, in the
Kanimbla valley. The original grant
of this was to the emancipist doctor
whom Macquarie befriended and who
did so much to help the early days of
medicine in Sydney. Redfern is at the
foot of the valley, surrounded by majes-
tic and towering peaks.
At the annual meeting of the French-
Australian League of Help it was
decided to donate £2OO to the French
Benevolent Society of Sydney. An appeal
was made for more funds to continue
the work and about £l5O was raised that
afternoon. Comforts and financial help
will continue to be sent to General de
Gaulle’s organisation in London, the
Association des Amis des Volontaires,
under the patronage of Lord Lloyd. At
the suggestion of Dr. Gelle, in Perth, who
is one of General de Gaulle’s representa-
tives in Australia, it was decided to alter
somewhat the society’s name, which will
now be the French-Australian League of
Help, affiliated with the Free French
Forces Fund.
Santa Claus, after a most exciting
journey in his magic aeroplane, has
arrived in Sydney and is settled in
his cave at Anthony Horderns’. Thou-
sands of his small friends have already
been to see him, and lots of children
living in the country have sent him
letters. He has a sackful as high as his
head. One little girl says: “Please,
Santa Claus, don’t spend any money on
presents for me ; spend the money you
would buy them with for me on the
little children who have come over from
England.”
To get to Santa you board the good
ship Bounty (this is an exact copy of
the Bounty the kids will read about in
Australian history when they get older).
This is manned by two sailors in white.
One helps the tiny ones up the gang-
plank ; the other stands at the wheel and
sees the ship does not get off her course.
Although she does rock a bit all you do
is sit in the nice cosy cabin, look at
the scenery, and in no time you arrive at
the pirates’ cave with its chests of jewels,
and the next minute you see Santa wait-
ing for you!
Cakes and certificates made joyous
partnership last week when the Memorial
College of Domestic Science had its
before-Christmas rally. This was timed
for the afternoon. The sun shone warm,
the breeze blew cool and the company
filled both the large reception-rooms and
the verandah facing the harbor. Lady
Wakehurst crossed the bridge to Kirri-
billi to hand out the eertificates, and as
this was her first visit’she started off by
a tour of the pleasant and flowerful
rooms.
The college principal, Mrs. Whittaker,
read the report. Dr. Mary Booth, who
with members of the council and other
importants had greeted the Governor’s
wife at the entrance, made the speech of
welcome. Dr. Mary’s pink-and-white skin
and blue eyes received maximum sup-
port from graceful blue-and-white chif-
fons. Lady Wakehurst looked cool as
an iris in blue striped sheers. Tea, for
which luscious cakes and biscuits had
been made by the students, was enjoyed
by the guests, who, if not exactly star-
scattered, were on the grass. There was
also a display of toys, embroideries,
dresses and preserves made by the seven-
teens and upwards, who for the occasion
had forsaken their green uniforms for
more frivolous frocks.
Adelaide knows Dr. Mary Puckey,
newly appointed as chief executive officer
to the Rachel Forster Hospital, well and
favorably. She has spent the last four
years on the staff of the Metropolitan
infectious diseases hospital at Northfield.
Before that she was a member of the
staff of the South Australian Education
Department. At the Northfield hospital
she was assistant medical officer, and
acting medical superintendent for the
greater part of this year.
Last week an envelope with a green
stamp with a minareted building on it
enfolded a Christmas greeting from the
Henri Segaert couple. You will remem-
ber he was Belgium’s popular Consul-
General here for so long. Now he and
his wife make their home in Thailand, in
which country he is Belgium’s Minister-
Plenipotentiary. The design on the card
is an exotic-looking little chariot on great
wooden wheels. It suggests that it might
be harder to keep one’s balance in it
than in an Irish jaunting car.

Chatter
Father Christmas already has his chin
over the window sill —fetes are around us
thick and heavy, all for good and neces-
sitous causes —which doesn’t mean that
the Red Cross Shop in Collins-street is
relaxing and sitting upon its laurels, very
admirable . laurels, earned by collect-
ing £1650 from May 22 last to mid-
December. Quaint and attractive gifts
are constantly being replenished upon the
shelves, and there are prices to suit both
big budgets and the new taxation. For
those with but a modest sixpence to spend
cartons of mint jelly are recommended.
What could be handier to have on tap to
partner cold lamb on a hot day? Mrs.
Hume Turnbull continues to decorate
the window with mixed flowers gor-
geously arranged.
The W.A.S.P.S. deserve not stings but
a pat on the back apiece for the good
taste displayed in their Christmas shop,
a two-days’ effort for their patriotic
funds in the gold room of the Australia.
At a time when fetes are rampant, when
getting rid of rubbish is often part of
the game, and ugly, useless objects are
piled off on to those unresisting enough
to buy them, it’s pleasant to find things
that are attractive, useful and moderately
priced.
The Wasps have worked for thiee
months, meeting regularly at a work-
room in town, handing round things
already cut out and bringing them back
made up, etc. Among these were toys
of inexpensive materials which when
finished became animals of winsome
natures and strongly-sewn physique.
Children’s quilts were also collective
efforts, in which draughtboard patterns
of animal appliques, etc., were achieved
upon unbleached calico foundations.
Particularly successful were the waste-
paper baskets of enamelled tin (handy to
put under the tap after some thoughtless
pal has emptied a full ashtray there-
abouts). These were decorated with origi-
nal color designs. Margaret Gunnersen
gave some of hers giddy cancan girls and
frills of black lace around the tops of
the baskets. Margaret’s sister Jo also
proved clever with pencil and brush, and
Mary Lundqvist and Guelda Pyke, both
full of ideas and crafty notions, turned
out excellent work and helped the lesser
Wasps achieve masterful finishing
touches.
Among Guelda’s triumphs were waste-
paper baskets, lampshades and oil-painted
glassware—bottles, carafes, glasses, etc.
Some were goldfish bowls with fish upon
the surface, so it won’t matter so much
if the real fish die, as they always seem
to do in circular confinement. Marie
Manniche produced among other things
some fascinating cushions. One, with its
three funny figures, she called “Incon-
stancy.” Topsy Brown’s skill with a
needle was much appreciated.
Lady Dugan, who opened the little
show, took home among her purchases
one of Olive Thompson’s lamps. Mrs.
Keith Halley, Athalie Cuming, Mrs. John
Howse, who welcomed Lady Dugan, and
an odd dozen or so more Wasps assisted
in numerous ways. Offstage encourage-
ment came from Wilfrid McCulloch, who
painted elephants upon a lampshade.
Noela Adams was a contributor to trays
decorated with newsprint, labels from
beer-bottles and from trunks that have
been round the world and back again.
Pot plants and flowers fresh and dewy
assisted the petty cash ; so did a nest of
small fluffy kittens, very much alive-o
when they weren’t asleep, which sold for
two bob each.
Among recently-announced engage-
ments is that of Patricia Synnot and
Michael Seymour Hawker. “Patsey,”
whose photograph is from Spencer Shier,
is the eldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Monckton Synnot, Dulverton, Kensing-
ton-road, and her fiance is the younger
son of the late M. S. Hawker and of
Mrs. Hawker, Aldgate and North Bun-
garee (S.A.).
Australia, isolated as never before, is
making the best of its own talents.
Maybe the day is near at hand when the
prophet in his own country will be given
a fair go from the moment he starts to
murmur in his beard. Two grown-in-
Australia events of the week were the
Borovansky ballet 'season and the Vic.
Salon of Photography’s exhibition at the
Athenaeum.
Even those who aren’t ballet-minded
must grant that Edward and Xenia
Borovansky have accomplished some-
thing worth while in organising an Aus-
tralian ballet co. and putting over a first
season which was much appreciated for
its two full-house nights at the Comedy.
The audience was by no means all doting
parents or the social strain that goes
everywhere that G.H. goes. It was cos-
mopolitan, hoping for its money’s worth
and generous in its praise of artistry and
talent. The choreography of the first
ballet, “Pas Classique,” was by Madame
Xenia Borovansky; that of the other
three, “Autumn Leaves,” “Vltava” and
“L’Amour Ridicule,” was by Edward
Borovansky. The classical piece was
danced to Tschaikowsky music. “Autumn
Leaves,” with the cold wind, the leaves,
the late chrysanthemum, the poet and
the children, is an arrangement to
Chopin’s music. “Vltava,” inspired by
the compositions of the Czech musician
Smetana, tells of the spirit of the river
and of a young country, the little streams
that meet in the placid fields where the
village boys and girls are dancing, the
mighty river that flows over the rapids
and past the medieval citadel Vysehrad.
In “L’Amour Ridicule” there is panto-
mime, a young girl and her lover, the rich
dandy, the old father with ambitions, the
youth and beauty of the village and the
inevitable happy ending. Therein Dorothy
Stevenson, as Pepita, revealed herself as
a comedian as well as a clever young
dancer with more than a fair share of
beauty. Principal role of light-as-thistle-
down Laurel Martyn was as the spirit in
“Vltava.” Corrie Lodders danced a varia-
tion in the classical ballet, and Edna
Busse and Rachael Cameron alternated
on the two nights in roles for further
variations and for the part of the
Chrysanthemum among the autumn
leaves.
Young Edna, who has improved out of
all recognition during the last year or two,
had bad luck in her solo on the first
night. She caught her foot in the back
curtain and fell. Her plucky recovery
was instantaneous, and she got an enor-
mous ovation and an impulsive kiss upon
the brow from Madame, an elegant
figure in white with long black velvet
evening coat when she took her pro-
ducer’s bow with her young pupils.
The ballet season, which went so
smoothly with Lord and Lady Dugan in
one of the boxes, was produced in blood
and tears and mild attacks of hysteria—
fortunately all past and almost for-
gotten when the first curtain went up.
Biggest heartbreak was the orchestra,
which was only available for one re-
hearsal. The co. has found that it’s no
joke getting professional musicians, so
many of whom are tied up with contracts
with the A.B.C. and other bodies. The
theatre also was only available for one
day and evening of rehearsing, and then
at the last moment, when everybody was
dead beat, in came the Health officials,
who said: “You can’t have those pianos
there; an exit is blocked,” but they
turned out to be quite nice men under
their official skins and helped move the
pianos somewhere else. Help was forth-
coming for designs of scenery and cos-
tumes from Bill Constable and Dolia
Ribush ; and Edward Borovansky, who is
something of an artist with a pencil, drew
the designs for the river and peasant cos-
tumes which the dancers filled up in
paint.
All the girls of the corps-de-ballet
have jobs, and only their evenings are
available for classes, so it was all the
more credit to them that most of them
made their own costumes, with help from
young Edna Busse, general factotum of
scissors and sewing-machine in the studio.
Edna also made some of the lads’ cos-
tumes, and commandeered in turn Serge
Bousloff, N. Neville, M. Braum, Roger
Racine and others for fittings in between
rehearsals.
Among those in the first-night audience
were Captain and Mrs. Paul Henry, who
accompanied the Dugans, both Lady D.
and Mrs. Henry wearing moonlight-blue,
the one threaded with silver, the other
a-glitter with sequins upon a brief jacket.
With an organdie-clad young daughter
apiece were Mrs. Eccles Mac Kay, Mrs.
Roy Warnock and Mrs. Gerald Noall,
plus Dr. Mac Kay, who seemed quite at
ease among so much excitable youth and
beauty. The Daryl Lindsays were there ;
also the Wesley Hoopers (most faithful
of young couples who follow ballet for its
own sake), Mrs. D.- S. Rolls and sister
Florrie Green, Mrs. Keith Fairley in
black net scattered with blue flowers, and
Mrs. Colin Johnstone in stripes that a
jungle beetle would envy. Mrs. J. V.
Fairbairn wore a black gown and white
foxes, and not far away were the John
Goodalls, Kath with white gerberas upon
her lapels and opera glasses, which she
made much use of, as part of her handbag
impedimenta.
Sunday Wenman, inset herewith by
Broothorn, has chosen for her wedding
day February 3, for it’s the wedding
anniversary of her parents. Bridegroom
Keith Johns is making a very hurried
trip from Sydney to Melbourne for the
ceremony, which is at three in the after-
noon at All Saints’, so that felicitations
must needs be short and merry before
the Spirit of Progress steams out of
Spencer-street at 6.30. The new home
will be a flat in Elizabeth-street, Sydney.
Good wishes and toasts for the occa-
sion will be honored at the home of the
bride’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles
Wenman. Sunday’s picture gown is of
white moire satin. Regarding her veil
she’s undecided between clouds of tulle
and the family veil of Honiton lace.
Sister Patricia, otherwise Mrs. Dudley
Barr, will be matron-of-honor in white,
because she didn’t wear white for her
own wedding, and something very saucy
in turbans.
Gilt-edged invitation cards sent out in
the names of the professional musical,
dramatic and artists’ societies of Victoria
filled the banqueting hall at Menzies for
a welcome home to Ruby Davy, Aus-
tralia’s only woman doctor of music. Dr.
Davy gave an interesting talk on her
experiences. She has composed a “Sym-
phony in Color,” inspired by her visit to
Ceylon. Red Sea environment gave her
the threads of another composition,
“Loneliness.” But for the war she would
have remained away three years.
All her plans, however, did not go
awry. She was one of the first people
to give a concert in London after the
.outbreak of war. It was a great success,
and so were further concerts, some in
Birmingham. Her associate artist was
violinist Albert Sammons. While prac-
tising one afternoon for her first con-
cert Dr. Davy was interrupted by a large
policeman ; she hadn’t drawn her black-
out curtains, and it looked for a moment
as if her career would finish before it
had begun. However, all was smoothed
over, and she and her numerous trunks
eventually arrived safely back home.
Several musicians contributed to the
musical programme for the reception at
Menzies, and proceedings finished with
supper.
All States but Tasmania are repre-
sented in the Victorian Salon of Photo-
graphy’s exhibition at the Athenaeum,
which may be seen for a silver coin (pro-
fits go to the Red Cross). Although the
international exhibits of past years are
missed for their variety and imaginative
qualities, technique is high in the present
show.
As always, interest was high in Dr.
Julian Smith’s portraiture, straight, char-
acter, philosophical (“Nothing for No-
thing” got under the skin) and exotic
(wherein Sono Osato was one of his
most successful models). The snow pic-
tures had their own following of vigor-
ous people who love ski-ing. Edwin
Adamson, Duncan Wade and Eric Mer-
ton were among those who carried
cameras over the mountains in winter.
Among John Eaton’s fine out-of-doors
studies (he’s outstanding for landscapes)
was his “Cattle Tracks,” which has been
shown and highly praised by master
photographers in many parts of the
world.
Among those present for the opening
by Lord Dugan were Lady Dugan and
the Paul Henrys, Dr. and Mrs. Julian
Smith and a further bunch of medicoes,
including Stewart Cowen, in uniform,
and Balcombe Quick, who was an exhi-
bitor. Knight Charles Conmbere was
there ; also the Arthur Dickinsons, Mrs.
Stuart Murray, Chefik Bey and Edgar
Rouse, all set for leaving that evening
for Sydney; also the newly-married
Richard Watsons, Richard being the well-
known G. and S. basso. Knight Julian
Bruche called in, and his good lady was
on deck in spite of an arm in a sling, a
businesslike accessory to her Red Cross
uniform. She sprained her wrist while
taking down curtains after Noel Coward’s
Red Cross concert at G.H. Other Red
Cross workers in uniform included Mrs.
Kent Hughes, Sybil and Freda Irving
and Mrs. Sidney B. Myer, who now walks
forth with three crimson stripes upon her
cuffs.

THE SERVICE MAN
The Battle for Libya.
“Ek Dum”: Even for the Italians who
suffered, events in North Africa during a
fast-moving week must have had some
of the air of the best kind of grand
opera. There were stealings in the dusk,
there was a sudden scene of violence, and
there was General Wavell, like the Duke
in “Rigoletto,” between two choices —an
inviting lot of Italians on his left and
another inviting lot on the right.
The Italians lay behind a line of forts
in the miserable coastal country, clinging
to their new pipeline across the desert
from Libya, and to the military road
which was their only means of swift
retreat. Their front, east of Sidi Barrani,
reached points over 80 miles from Libya,
but the main British front still lay 70
miles away based on the railhead at
Mersa Matruh. The front fort line was
not quite intact. For a week a British
mechanised unit had been boring test
holes in it.
The weather had reached its winter
nadir. That is, there were fine old jinks
in the upper air, plenty of dust in the
pannikin and a series of temperatures
which climbed up on the roof at midday
and went down a native well at night.
Also, there were sandstorms ad lib.
Such tribulations are harder to bear
on a diet of macaroni and rationed water,
with a cube of occasional veal washed
down with a teaspoonful of olive-oil, than
they are on Australian beef, bread and all
the other comparative luxuries available
to a British Army which has never heard
the word ersatz.
On Saturday night, December 7, a
large section of the British forces moved,
while the R.A.F. created a diversion for
the Italian ’planes by pasting everything
in sight which looked as if it might be
turned into ravioli. They particularly
pasted Castel Benito, near Tripoli, named
after the Duce, and considered to be
Libya’s main military store centre.
This relieved the Imperial Army of
Egypt and the Nile —as the British forces
were christened in reminiscence of an
earlier force —of the inconveniences of
having too many prying eyes about. But
even then the difficulties of moving a
large army 75 miles at a single bound
over country almost devoid of cover
was about the biggest job of its kind ever
undertaken, more especially as the force
then had to lie doggo, disguised as a bit
of desert, all through Sunday and the
next night.
On Sunday night, as on Saturday, a
free fireworks show had been organised
by the R.A.F. for the Italians, particu-
larly at Benghazi and on front-line aero-
dromes round Sidi Barrani.
Zero hour came on December 9 at
dawn, and it was obvious that the British
troops were not suffering from Monday-
itis.
Their match with Graziani began with
a sort of feint at the breadbasket — i.e., in
the centre of his line at Mabeya, south of
Sidi Barrani. While Italian headquarters
were trying to discover what had hap-
pened to 500 prisoners and a general and
his deputy, who had been killed, a sudden
commotion on the right—south—of their
line advised them that they had been hit
there by a sort of mechanised tornado.
By 10 a.m. the main operations of the
first phase were concluded. The British
troops had crossed eight miles of no-
man’s-land. They had turned the Italian
right flank. They had tested the Italian
centre and cleared up an important ad-
vanced post. They paused to consolidate
while the Navy’s 15-inch guns and newly-
arrived Hurricanes played old hob with
the Italian lines right back past Solium to
the border.
The sun went down on December 9
with the R.A.F. complete masters of
the air, the R.N. still rumbling away out
at sea and Intelligence trying to count
what looked like 4000 prisoners.
From this stage onwards the fighting
seemed to lose all general pattern in detail
and become very much like that which
took place in France after Germany
broke the Somme lines. The nature of the
defences called for a policy of “isolate
and permeate.”
Armored units made their way between
the Italian defence islands dotting the
ocean of desert behind Sidi Barrani to
the coast. This does not mean that
the frontal forces of the Italians were cut
off, as it would have meant in old-
fashioned war. The armored unit, like
the defence island, under the new plan
of things, is a world in itself. It dives
like a mad bull, smashes its way as far as
it can and doesn’t give two buttons for
communications or physical liaison (it
has a radio ’phone when it can use it),
or anything but the hurt it can do and
the demoralisation it can cause and the
depth of the wound it can make with
its charge.
At the same time, penetration right
across the Italian central defences did
mean that at least two divisions of
Italians round Sidi Barrani were, within
24 hours of the first shot in the battle,
inside a triangle which was leaking tanks
like a sieve from three sides and being
sprinkled with h.e. -and incendiary sky
"I've taught them to finish off the movement with a follow through, sir!”
fodder in the shape of 5001 b. bombs and
19201 b. h.e. shells. With these the R.N.
turrets were gently spraying them with
irritating monotony.
All doubt as to whether the operation
was merely a big raid or a major en-
gagement was dispelled entirely when it
became known that it was under personal
command of Lieut.-General Sir Henry
Maitland Wilson, who belongs to one of
England’s toughest fighting families, and
who gave up command of the 2nd
Division at Aldershot to go to Egypt.
(His uncle was one of the select band
of British officers who went to Kandahar
with Roberts, and saw the Great War
out on actual active service.) The Italians
added to the certainty by claiming that
about 50,000 men were being used on the
British side.
On Dec. 11 Italians east of the line
along which the British units had pene-
trated to the coast were in an equilateral
triangle, the inland apex of which was
about 15 miles south of Sidi Barrani at
Nibeiwa.
By December 12 the situation was
more confused than ever. Numbers of
Italians captured became astronomical in
the sensational press. The only things
certain were that the Italian frontal forts
had been knocked to pieces. Mechan-
ised British units were wandering in in-
creasing numbers over what had been
Italian-held territory. They were encoun-
tering fierce resistance at various points,
particularly round water supplies, which
are a controlling factor in certain parts
of the battle area. They had large num-
bers of prisoners. They had killed large
numbers of Libyan native and other
troops. And they were making headway
every hour.
December 15 found the picture clarify-
ing itself out of the dust which swept over
Western Egypt in clouds driven by a
bitter wind.
For over 100 miles from Mektila,
where the advance posts of the Italians
had lain east of Sidi Barrani, to Solium
and Bardia, the countryside had been
reduced' to a condition like that of a
Georgina cattle camp by the pounding of
wheels and the impact of shells and
bombs. It was completely hidden under
a pall of rising dust and fumes wherever
operations were still in progress. And
it needs little imagination for anybody
with experience of motoring in desert
lands to gauge the condition of mechan-
ised transport.
The terrain of the battle had covered
over 2000 square miles. Where the
Italians were not cut off they were in full
retreat, ploughing hurriedly through the
coastal gorge which leads from Solium
across the border to Bardia under the
continual fire of naval guns and bom-
bardment from the air.
On the sixth day of the offensive our
fellows had bagged at least 30,000 prison-
ers, including divisional staffs and appar-
ently one corps staff and its head, General
Gallina. Our losses are said to have
been remarkably light. For one thing,
only advanced troops were engaged. In-
fantry have been involved only as
subsidiaries —picked veterans with ex-
perience of desert fighting. The A.1.F.,
save for some transport and other tech-
nical troops, has been in reserve along
with other legions who are the flower of
the hand-to-hand ground fighters.
The R.A.A.F., however, has been in
the van. At the week-end an Australian
squadron was in camp further west than
any other air unit with General Wavell’s
army. It has been engaged in every type
of operation, from ground-strafing to
reconnaissance, and has done its share of
the destruction of enemy ’planes, which,
driven almost completely out of the sky
in the end, lost at least 36 machines
during the week of fighting.
One R.A.A.F. flight alone was credited
with a bag of six Italian machines. There
is scarcely a fighter in the squadron who
had not his stories of actual combat
and victory. The Australians are repre-
sentative—bushmen from western Queens-
land, Sydney men and a former Gover-
nor’s private secretary, who made Aus-
tralia his adopted land and married an
Australian.
Generally speaking, the R.A.F. and
Dominion Air Forces played increasingly
high havoc toward the week-end. Bardia,
El Gubbi, Gambut, Tmimi, Boma and
Gazala all had their pepperings. On
Friday alone 15 Italians were picked out
of the sky.
On December 14 Italian columns
began to move out of Bardia to-
wards Tobruk and there was bloody
fighting across the Libyan border, near
Fort Capuzzo, which had been taken and
lost in raids and counter-raids early in
the war.
General Wavell’s order of the day is
a historical document. It said that the
battle would be one of the decisive events
of the war ; that it would have incal-
culable effects not only on the whole posi-
tion in the Middle East—these it has had
already—but on the situation everywhere
and upon the future of civilisation
throughout the world. It might shorten
the war by months.
It well might. The precision and dead-
liness with which the attack was carried
out, its complete success, its swiftness must
have its moral effect throughout the world.
The military value of another 100 miles
of advance would be great. Given com-
mand of the Italian bases of Bardia,
Tobruk, Derna and Benghazi, and the
British mastery of Cyrenaica and the
eastern Mediterranean would be com-
plete—Crete is only 180 miles from the
Libyan coast. The Dodecanese will join
the rest of the Eastern Italian possessions
in siege. It is, of course, a long way to
Tripoli, and some of the country is much
worse than any along the Egyptian
border. But mechanised transport has
changed all the elements of time and
space in war where there are no major
obstacles like great mountain ranges.
Libya is faced with the prospect of com-
plete conquest.
And the Italian position is doubly un-
comfortable because in Morocco, Algeria
and Tunisia there are 500,000 French
troops under General Weygand, whose
presence the Italian High Command can-
not afford to forget for a moment.
In Albania.
“Ek Dum”: Still helped by the R.AF.,
which seems to have achieved complete
air ascendancy in Albania before the
storm broke in Western Egypt, the
Greeks made small but steady advances
in Albania last week. More could not
have been expected. The weather has
gone from bad to worse —snow and sleet,
and the roads pure grease and congested
with the debris of the Italian retreat.
Also, the capture of towns like Argyro-
kastro and Santi Quaranta means that
there is a lot of consolidation to do, and
that the victors are every day getting
further away from their bases.
Nevertheless, at the week-end they had
occupied Porto Palermo, and were push-
ing on towards Himara, on the lonian
coastal road. In other words, they are
only 12 miles from the coastal plain, and
less than 30 miles from Valoqa, which
has been badly blasted by the R.A.F.
Moving pictures of the meeting
between Hitler and Ribbentrop, Musso-
lini and Ciano arrived in Australia a few
days ago. Hitler looked fat and well,
Ribbentrop a little worried, Ciano droop-
ing ; but if Mussolini’s picture is a
symptom of Italy’s war position, all is
lost. He is as white and rigid of coun-
tenance as the muslin after which he is
named. There is a death-mask look
about him. He has become an old man
drained of his vivacity. He looks 70
and beaten.
Losses and Gains at Sea.
“Nobby II”: Losses of merchant ship-
ping continue to be serious. Those for
the week to December 1 amounted to
52,229 tons, 13 ships being lost; nine
were British (41,260 tons), three Allied
(5743) and one neutral (5135). The Ger-
mans claimed 227,500 tons. During the
previous week, according to an amended
Admiralty report, British losses were 20
ships totalling 80,426 tons.
Last week raiders were reported in the
Pacific and Indian Oceans. One shelled
a steamer within sight of Nauru, just
south of the Equator on the old B.P.
Sydney-Jaluit route. The islanders
noticed a ship on fire ear i y on Dec . 8,
but the weather was bad, and she dis-
appeared into the haze. In the afternoon
a burning ship again loomed up, with
another one some distance away, appar-
endy firing on her. A number of other
ships in the vicinity were ordered to dis-
perse for safety. The fact that they
have not been heard from does not neces-
sardy mean that any have disappeared,
when there is a raider about wireless
s ii en ce is more than golden,
Qn Dec 13 it was repor ted that a
raider in the Indian Qcean ha d captured

other escaping German ship, the Rhein,

Losses about the Australian coast have
not been limited to mined ships. On
s.s. Orungal, piled up on a reef off
Barwon Heads on the Victorian coast,
a mysterious fire broke out in the boiler-
room at 2.30 a.m. on Dec. 13. The vessel
became a total wreck. And in
the darkness of the morning of Dec.
15 the coastal steamer Cardross (1896
tons) and the Island vessel Fiona (2198
tons) figured in a collision 20 miles south
of Sydney Heads. Nobody was killed
and none injured save the fourth engineer
of the Cardross, but that vessel, with a
great hole torn in her plates, went to
the bottom and the Fiona had a large
part of her bows shorn away. The
Cardross carried 3000 tons of cargo.
Among it was portion of the current
issue of The Bulletin’s small sister the
“Woman’s Mirror.”
Still Less Blitzkrieg.
“Aileron”: For parts of two weeks
Londoners have had respite from the
bombing. Last week began with 48 hours
of complete calm, and thereafter attacks
were sporadic. Birmingham, however,
had another bad blasting—the King made
the 110-mile journey from London to
see the wreckage and show his sympathy
with the people—and on December 12
Sheffield had its first great raid.
Sheffield is a city of ups and downs,
with a black industrial core against which
some lovely suburbs nestle. It is the
great English centre of fine steel work.
Hadfields, with tens of thousands of men
employed on armament works, are there ;
also Firths and a dozen great makers of
plate, fine cutlery and precision steel and
its products. The 18in. shells for the
biggest guns of the last war were made
in Sheffield.
The damage was limited by a heavy
barrage which brought down two
bombers. Fires were started, and the
Germans exhibited their technique of
machine-gunning firemen. But the Air
Ministry reported that casualties were
amazingly few.
Weather impeded R.A.F. operations,
but our bombers contrived to get in a
few blasts every day. Boulogne had one
of its worst nights fires could be
seen by daylight next morning 30 miles
across the Channel. Lorient and Brest
were attacked. Mannheim, well down
in the industrial Rhineland, shared with
Bremen lengthy visits during which the
skyline was painted in lurid colors by
determined British squadrons.
Some of the big guns at Gris-Nez kept
up a steady fire for several days. Ger-
man reconnaissance ’planes solemnly
announced that they had seen the results
of hits by the shells between Folkestone
and Canterbury, so the range of these
guns is at least 30 miles. However, the
amount of damage they are doing to
civilian morale may be judged by a refer-
ence to them received in a letter from
a man of Kent: “Hitler keeps dropping
saucepans or something from his pea-
shooters at Gris-Nez. They hit England
right enough, but that’s all you can say
thev do.”
Newspapers Bombed.
“Ek D.”: November was an unquiet
month for London printing. “Hansard
came out a day late. A bomb fell through
a 15,000-gallon fire tank on the roof of
the “Evening Standard” building. The
“Daily Sketch” got a nasty battering, and
one of its photographers, Charles Max-
well, was killed.
The “Times” was not spared. A bomb
dropped straight through the middle of
the old building. It cleaned up all the
editorial rooms, the priceless library, the
counting-house, the advertisements for
country houses and the personal an-
nouncements ready for the day after to-
morrow. And it woke up Major Astor,
who was asleep in the board-room. For-
tunately it did not touch the machine-
room, where the staff had paid a few
minutes’ tribute to the Blitzkrieg by stop-
ping the machines in conformity with the
electricity regulations. Neither did it
reach the staff, which was eating a solemn
sandwich in the crypt or cellar.
After the explosion the assistant man-
ager went to the roof to see that the
lookouts were still intact. Major Astor
went back to the board-room to sleep.
The machines started again and printed
the whole issue to schedule.
Next day carpenters boarded up the
windows. A room was found with a
whole floor intact, and into this the
whole staff was packed from the editor
downwards. Five days afterwards,
ently after serious deliberation, the
“Times” announced the fact that its office
had been bombed —just about as excit-
edly as if its office boy had been run over
by a bicycle. Its issues showed no marks
of the battering.
“Zedo”: Britain executed two spies
the other day—a young German and a
young Hollander. Caught with a wire-
less transmitter, they were not imprisoned
in the Tower and shot there like soldiers,
as were most of their kind in the last
war; they were dropped through the
floor at Pentonville. Their wireless equip-
ment was packed into a case Bin. square,
with batteries in a second case, Min.
by 6in. —quite good enough to communi-
cate across the Channel by Morse.
* * * *
“Nobby II”: The rescue of the British
ship mined off the S.A. coast was a great
feat, though the weather helped con-
siderably. Most of the crew declared
that it was a mystery how the ship floated
at all. And, apart from the damage done
to her, there were enough Jonahs on
board to sink the British Fleet. The 15-
year-old ship’s boy had already had one
experience of being mined ; a seaman
had been at Dunkirk, and had seen
four ships destroyed around his own in
one bombing attack ; another had been
on a vessel in the North Sea when she
was sunk by an aerial torpedo. Several
others had suffered in U-boat attacks.
It shows what a gallant lot are the men
of the merchant navy and how hazard-
ous are their lives.
* * * *
“X.N.”: Another naval patrol vessel,
built by Melbourne Harbor Trust at Wil-
liamstown (Vic.) and named Ballarat, was
launched last week. Premier Dunstan
remarked that his Government was ready
to do everything humanly possible to
build up a large shipbuilding industry.
It was a matter for private industry, but if
private industry would not do it he sup-
posed some other method must be used.
Private enterprise is ready enough to do
the job, and can do it very well, as
experience is proving at Cockatoo Dock
(N.S.W.), Whyalla (S.A.), Maryborough
(Q.) and elsewhere —but it needs better
co-operation from some unions than it
has been getting recently.
* * * *
“Nobby II”: It is reported that the
35,000-ton battleships Bismarck and Von
Tirpitz have joined the German fleet and
that the 40,000-ton Hindenburg and her
sister will “soon” be added. The Bis-
marcks are the opposite numbers of the
King Georges, and carry eight 15in., 12
5.9 in. and 16 2in. guns. They have a
speed of about 28 knots. If the others
are to be completed “soon,” an all-time
record must have been put up with them.
They had not even been launched early
this year.
* * * *
The first hospital ship from the war
zones, carrying 300 Australian and Maori-
land soldiers and a small party of naval
men, has reached Australia. Most of the
patients are suffering from illness and
accidental injuries, but there were several
men wounded in action. They had a
varied lot of tales to tell about sea fights
in the Mediterranean, desert skirmishes
round Sidi Barrani and air raids in Pales-
tine.
* * * *
It being Government policy to main-
tain a defence force of 250,000 men, ten
additional age-groups are to be called
up—unmarried men or childless widowers
who reached 19, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
32 or 33 during the year to June 30,
1940 —and the required number will begin
70 days’ training in depots in March.
Also, the Defence Department has
decided to employ V.A.Ds. for military
hospital work. They will be paid 4s. a
day and given £2O for personal outfit.
* * * *
Maoriland celebrated the centenary of
its separation from N. S. Wales on Nov.
16, and on the same day it was announced
that Maorilanders had won 50 decora-
tions in the R.A.F. —39 D.F.Cs., includ-
ing two with bar, four D.F.Ms., six
A.F.Cs. and one Croix de Guerre. The
following week saw four more decorated,
and there have been several since.
* * * *
The Italians claim to be perfecting a
new aeroplane “capable of 621 m.p.h.
at 40,000 ft.” If there is anything in the
yarn the new bus, fitted with a smoke-
screen, should be popular with the Italian
Navy.
* * * *
“Nobby II”: The R.A.N. is growing
at such a rate that its accommodation
in Sydney calls for another £150,000
wharf and new naval depot on a 40-acre
site on Hunter’s Bay, near Balmoral-
estimated cost £290,000. Personnel in
the senior service is now over 15,000.
* * * *
“Auntie Xantie”: Time somebody took
a few pictures of Greeks in action. One
Yankee newspaperman, supported by
several of Our Own Correspondents,
describes them as large, fierce, hawk-eyed
men who jump up from behind the
rocks of the north twirling fearsome
moustaches and shouting “Hellas!” as
they bound from crag to crag after the
hare-like Private Spaghetti. Another,
Leland Stowe, says that they are little
fellows. My own impression of them a
few years ago was that their physique
was good in the main, and their height
more than sft. sin., the figure mentioned
by Stowe. I saw them in action only two
or three times on their own borders,
and I can testify to the manner in which
they can charge. If the Greek Army con-
sists of Greek Customs Guards I don’t
wonder Musso. didn’t get a chance on the
Albanian border.
The Air War Day by Day.
December 9-10: Little activity over
England during the day; no night
raids. R.A.F. shoots down German
bomber over North Sea. R.A.F. bombs
Bremen, also Lorient and Boulogne,
where fires were visible in daylight across
the Channel next day. Germans report
activities restricted by bad weather and

Germany. They claim three British and
three German ’planes down.
R.A.F. bombs Valona (Albania), hitting
south jetty and several buildings; all
machines return.
R.A.F., R.A.A.F. and other Imperial
forces take part in bombing and machine-
gunning of Italian troops, communications
and ports on Libyan front. Assab
(Eritrea) and various points on Djibuti-
Addis Ababa railway bombed. In

Italian Air Force from leaving the
ground.
British and Greek machines keep up
constant attacks on retreating Italians in
Albania.
Dec. 12-13 : Savage attack on Sheffield ;
large number of bombs dropped ; fire-
men machine-gunned. London and Liver-
pool also attacked. Three German ’planes
down in daylight. Bad weather prevents
R.A.F. raid on Germany. Brest raided

Commercial Artists’ Show
In the first annual show of the Aus-
tralian Commercial and Industrial
Artists’ Association at the A.W.A. build-
ing, Sydney, most exhibitors seem to have
followed the American rather than the
British trend in commercial art. Ameri-
cans strive to sell the goods by making
them look as handsome and attractive
as possible ; the British (on the higher
levels, at all events) seek to attract atten-
tion by a jocular or fantastic dressing of
a sales argument, with slight or no
emphasis upon exact representation.
If the British method gives more scope
to Art with a big A, the American way
puts a premium on craftsmanship. These
Australians are almost all of them
excellent draughtsmen. About the best
all-rounder seems to be Ray Wenban. He
has a free, graceful line and can draw
men, women, dogs, horses, motor-cars,
with equal facility. Frank Whitmore is
another limner who puts snap into his
line. Ralph Warner is the chap who did
the big poster of an elderly cobbler
examining a shoe —“It’s well worn but
it’s worn well” —as good a bit of work

Charles Kingsley-Smith shows a fine
marine poster ; Percy Trompf, one of the
few poster men whose signature is well
known, is characteristically represented ;
F.ank Beck has a clean, logical style ;
Corothy Dibdin puts grace in every
line. Cam Pettigrew’s portrayal of
texture in pen-and-ink is remarkably
clever; John Elliot is another of the
reliable all-rounders.
Douglas Annand and S. Gould, who
follow the trend of the eccentric and
humorous, are successful in the flippant
English way. In color the palm goes to
Alan Rigby, whose Japanesy decorative
bits are delightful. Douglas Horman also
has a fine color-sense. There are a
dozen or more other artists, including
several women, who deserve mention,
but the catalogue is sketchy and incom-
plete and identification is not always
readily possible to the viewer,

I* l6 Koyd-JNichol show
Judged by the recent exhibition of their
work at Melbourne Athenaeum, Arthur
M. Boyd and Keith Nichol seem to be two
young men who have had the usual train-
ing, been dissatisfied with it and then
deliberately tried to be childlike. Un-
fortunately it is as difficult for the adult
to be childlike as for a modern man
to think like a man in the Middle Ages.
The reason why the drawings of untaught
children look more spontaneous than
most adults’ is that they have fewer
prejudices about what they see. The
Boyd-Nichol pictures are pleasing as
decorations.
* * * *
Cameramen as Artists
Judged by their current exhibition at
Melbourne Athenaeum, the cameramen
of the Vic. Salon of Photography are
beginning to realise the limitations of
their medium. Imitations of Velasquez
and Rembrandt are conspicuous by their
absence, and “straight” photography is
the rule rather than the exception. Time
was when members of camera clubs
solemnly learned academic rules about
design and composition and even lis-
tened to lectures on the subject from
their more misguided brothers of the
brush and palette.
The camera can’t take the place of the
eye of the painter, and its owner can’t
fake negatives in the dark room to make
a photo, look more like Nature if he
doesn’t know what Nature looks like.
But his camera can do things the painter
cannot. It can record facts which are
clean outside the scope of painting.
The best prints in the current show
are those that have been least manipu-
lated. Athol L. Shmith, F.R.P.S., shows a
quick eye for subject in his snappings
of the Russian ballet. Dr. Julian Smith,
as usual, runs away with the portrait
division. His “Uriah” and his portrait of
a fellow-sawbones, knight Thomas Dun-
hill, are striking. Andre Evinson’s “Max
Meldrum” is a good study.

Adelaide Picture-lending Plan
S.A. Society of Arts has started a
picture-lending plan on the lines found
effective at the Macquarie in Sydney and
elsewhere. According to the subscrip-
tion is the right to borrow for one’s
home paintings of varying values, with
a right of frequent exchange —or, of
course, ultimate purchase if the picture
is found good to live with. The collec-
tion open in the society’s gallery is quite
worth while as a show. Mostly land-
scape, and by local artists, it varies from
the veteran and reliable work of Howie
and T. H. Bone, Mary Harris and Gwen
Barringer to coming juniors such as Ivor
and Geoffrey Francis. Gilbert Roach’s
river mouth is perhaps the most attrac-
tive thing shown, and Dorrit Black has
a similar work to prove that her ultra-
modern stuff alongside is not her only
medium.
STAGE AND CONCERT
Australian Ballet
The short season of Australian ballet
at Meib. Comedy was eminently success-
ful. The house was packed on all occa-
sions and intensely enthusiastic, the
curtain rising and falling a dozen times
after every item. Though choreography
was all by Edouard Borovansky and
Mme. Borovansky, ex-Russian ballet,
most of the dancers hailed from Mel-
bourne.
“Pas Classique” to Tschaikowsky’s
music, “Autumn Leaves” to Chopin’s,
“L’Amour Ridicule” to Albeniz’s and
“Vltava” to Smetana’s comprised the pro-
gramme. The last-named purported to
express the renaissance of the Czech
nation and stood in need of a bit of a
postscript. But the girls representing the
little streams combining to form a river,
and the young men depicting huntsmen,
somewhat incongruously dressed like
tennis-players, wove themselves into many
charming patterns, and Laurel Martyn,
as the spirit of the river, showed so many
of the points of a first-class ballerina that
she brought the house down.
Orchestra was lacking, music being
supplied by guest pianists Roma Rain-
ford and Marjorie Summers. This made
less difference to the ensemble than would
be generally imagined. Paucity of scenery
also mattered little- —a good deal of the
scenery of the Russian ballet was aestheti-
cally nonsensical.
* * * *
Music and Pictures
Amidst a setting of thousands of
pounds’ worth of pictures, and pictures
that cost thousands without being worth
it, the University String Quartet, baritone
Alan Coad and pianist Carl Bartling
entertained a horde of listeners and
lookers under A.B.C. auspices in the
Stawell Gallery at the Melb. National
Gallery. When the ears of the audience
wandered off the music its eyes fell on the
“Banquet of Cleopatra” of Tiepolo and
other expensive purchases of the Felton
Bequest, and the music was probably
more tonally perfect than some of the
pictures. In between the items the music-
lovers took excursions into the bays and
alcoves of the other galleries, where, if
they had a mind to, they could reflect on
the fact that light is the executant of a
painting —precisely as Mr. Coad, Mr.
Bartling and the quartet players were
executants of the compositions of Haydn,
Schumann, Borodine and Gorbay —and
that the gallery trustees are very bad
lighters. They have just spent £20,000
on the business and produced an effect as
if the place were filled with mist from a
damp gully.
Apart from such considerations the
innovation was successful and is to be
repeated. The acoustics were reasonably
efficient, especially for Mr. Coad’s robust
singing, though the quartet needs to be
a good deal longer in combination. And
nobody walked off with the “Aphrodite”
or the £26,000 Rembrandt while every-
body was concentrating on the music.
AT THE TALKIES.
“The Bluebird”
A screen version of Maeterlinck’s fan-
tasy-classic, this is Sydney Embassy’s
Christmas special for the youngsters,
and, with Shirley Temple doing the
honors, they should lap it up.
The filmsmiths have tried to do justice
to the author and his depth of philosophic
thought, and at the same time to the en-
tertainment value of the film for
youngsters of six and under. The result
is that it wobbles indecisively from one
track to the other and makes a good job
of neither. Also, the close similarity
in theme and mechanics which the film
bears to “The Wizard of Oz” leads to
a comparison by which the present show
suffers a little.
Nevertheless, the extravagantly elabo-
rate settings in technicolor which Holly-
wood can turn on —particularly in this
instance the palatial palace of Mr. and
Mrs. Luxury and a depiction of a world
of unborn children —plus a pretty enough
little fairytale and a certain degree of
novelty, make it pretty good fare for
small fry.
Incidentally, bulldogs should be warned
against one false note —a scene wherein
a bulldog, resplendent in technicolor,
tears after a cat, barking like a terrier.
That is something the best bred bulldogs
never do.
* * * *
“Spring Parade”
The youthful songster Deanna Durbin
seems to have weathered the adolescent
stage successfully, and emerges in this
current offering at the State as a full-
blown screen wench complete with lurv
affair and all. Film has to do with a
country minx in old Austria who finds
her way to Vienna and there exerts her
charms successfully on ail and sundry,
her main victims being a ’andsome young
soldier and the Emperor himself. Makes
f.a.q. entertainment, mildly tuneful,
mildly funny, and whiles away an idle
hour or so.
* * * *
“Captain Caution”
At Sydney Century and all about an
American trading vessel’s adventures dur-
ing the American War of Independence.
The captain is killed, his daughter takes
over the ship, reduces hahnest first mate
to the ranks and appoints scoundrel in
his place. Sundry adventures, often well
depicted, keep the opus going until the
time arrives for first mate to redeem
himself in goil’s eyes and dispose of his
supplanter. Victor Mature as che main
male figure of the piece is a hulking
great figure of a man, but his histrionic
ability is somewhere below zero on this
showing. Louise Platt as the goil isn’t
much better. Bruce Cabot as the villain
of the piece turns in his usual neat work.
* . * * *
“Dulcy,” at Sydney St. James, amounts
to Ann Sothern giving her impression
of the compleat nitwit. It’s an uproar
from go to whoa. There is no plot to
speak of, just a string of absurd situa-
tions, excellently handled and evoking
laughs from stuff that could otherwise
have been very tame. Billie Burke,
Ronald Young and Ian Hunter are also
in the cast, the last-named being the only
misfit in the show. Main feature on
the same bill is another of the Hardy
family series, “Andy Hardy Meets Debu-
tante.”
* * * *
Junior thugs, cowboys and gangsters,
usually let loose in town and suburb at
this time of the year, can wade into a
good meaty programme at Sydney Capi-
tol. Wallace Beery is the chief egg in
“Wyoming,” and he’s getting slicker on
the draw with every appearance. He
stalks his victim and rounds him up at
gunpoint; then, holstering his own gun,
gives the ornery critter a chance to reach
for his artillery. The o.c., no mean hand
himself, leaps at the opportunity. Wal-
lace waits till the o.c.’s hand is about one
inch from his gun and then leaps into
action. In two seconds dead he draws
his weapon, administers a volley, restores
his gun to holster and gets halfway
through rolling a smoke.

Is the captain of a ship qualified to perforin
a marriage ceremony? —BBl3.
A marriage on board a ship at sea is valid
•according to the English Common Law if it
is solemnised by an ordained minister of the
Church of England or the Church of Rome.
If no such minister is on board, any form
of marriage is valid provided it is clear that
the parties freely consented and intended to
marry. Such marriages .are usually performed
by the captain.
* * * *
If wrong particulars are given us to place of
birth and age to the registrar of marriages by
one of the parties, does it alter the legality of
that marriage, and what would be the status of
a child born to the parties? —B666.
The incorrectness of the particulars furnished
to the registrar does not invalidate the mar-
riage and children born after the marriage
would be legitimate. But the person who wil-
fully makes any false statement on oath or
by solemn affirmation before the registrar is
guilty of perjury and is liable to prosecution
and punishment accordingly.

Is a bush fire brigade registered and approved
by the Shire Council liable for compensation
in the case of death or injury to its members
or subscribers, to other volunteers working
under the direction of the brigade captain or
to other volunteers fighting the fire but not
working under the direction of the brigade
captain ? —8690.
Assuming that the members and subscribers
are merely volunteers and are not paid for their
service so as to become “workers” within the
meaning of the N.S.W. Workers’ Compensation
Act, neither the brigade nor any of its officers
is liable for compensation. As to the brigade
captain, if he is an officer of the Shire Council,
appointed under the Local Government Act
to control the bush fire brigade, and he is in-
jured or killed by accident arising out of and
during the course of his employment, it may
be that the Shire Council would be liable to
pay compensation. Volunteers not directed
by the brigade captain have no claim.

An unmarried elderly woman died recently
in Queensland without leaving a will. She was
one of a family of eight. Two sisters and one
brother are still alive. Are the families of the
deceased brothers entitled to share in the division
of the small estate; if so, to what extent? If
not, how should the estate be divided? —B7B2.
The children of the deceased brothers stand
m the place of their parents; that is to
say, if two sisters and one brother are alive,
a od four brothers deceased leaving children,
the estate would be divided into seven equal
parts, the children of each deceased brother
taking one share to be divided between them
and the surviving brother and sisters one share
each.

Two single brothers own a freehold farm
as joint tenants. 1 am told that neither need
make a will; that on the death of one the
property must go to the other. Also, that
there will be no probate duties to be paid until
the surviving partner dies. Is this correct? Also,
partners have money at fixed deposit in bank.
Will this money be free of death duties when
the first partner dies? —8698.
On the death of one joint tenant the
property passes to the survivor without the
necessity for any will or other document. But
the interest of the deceased joint tenant in
the property is liable to both State and Federal
death duties. The same would apply to the
fixed deposit if the brothers held it as joint
tenants.

(1) Explanation of the medical term throm-
bosis ? (2) Causes ? (3) Is the condition
dangerous ? —8894.
(1) Thrombosis is the formation of a clot in-
side a bloodvessel. (2) The condition may be
brought about by injury or inflammation of the
vessel walls, by increased coagulability of the
blood from any cause, most commonly the
presence within it of germs or their toxins, or
a diminished rate of blood flow, such as may
occur, for example, when the heart action has
been weakened by disease. The clot itself is
called a thrombus. (3) One of the dangers of
thrombosis is that the clot is liable to separate
and be carried in the blood stream until it
becomes lodged within some vessel, causing
obstruction to the blood flow therein.

Explanation of the chess term to take a pawn
en passant"? —BB93.
The pawn has the privilege on being first
played in the game to advance two squares
unless in so doing he pass a square which is
attacked by a hostile pawn. In this case the
opponent may at his option permit him to
make the two steps forward, and there remain,
or may capture the opposing piece in his pas-
sage in the same way as if he had moved
but one step.

What is the revoke penalty at contract bridge,
and how does it differ from that of auction ?
—8896.
The penalty is 250 points above the line at
contract; 100 at auction. In contract, however,
if the declarer revokes, the opponents can, if
they prefer it, take two tricks instead of scoring
;he points. These tricks are scored above the
line if declarer has failed in his contract. When
the declarer is vulnerable it often pays better
to take these tricks than to score points for
the revoke.

(1) Details of table, net and ball used for
table tennis? (2) What body regulates these
matters ? —BBB4.
(1) The table is a rectangular surface of dark
color, 9ft. by sft., supported 2ft. 6in. above the
floor and made of inch-thick wood. The sur-
face is edged with a white line |in. broad. The
net divides playing surfaces into two courts
of equal size, 4ft. 6in. by 2ft. 6in., is 6ft. long
and 6£in. above table level. The outside
limits of each post are 6in. outside sidelines.
The ball is made of celluloid and is not less
than 4£in. and not more than in circum-
ference and not less than 2-270 z. and not
more than 2-250 z. in weight. (2) The Inter-
national Table Tennis Federation.

How can I produce diffused effects in
photography ? —BBBB.
Diffusion of focus can be produced in various
ways: by optical means in the construction
of the lens itself, so that a picture is obtained
in which details and outlines are softened and
masses broadened; it can be brought about by
putting the lens out of focus, or by the
obstruction of some translucent material when
making the print, printing through the glass
side of the negative, interposing a piece of
film or glass between negative and sensitive
paper when making contact prints, or by the
use of bolting silk when making enlargements.
Bolting silk is a fine-mesh translucent fabric.
It is interposed between the lens and the
bromide paper, various degrees of diffusion
being introduced according to the distance from
the paper. The cloth should be stretched on a
light frame.
* * * *
What is "curvature of field” in a photo-
graphic lens? —8889.
In a single or uncorrected lens the rays of
light do not come to a focus at the same time
on a plane surface—such as the surface of a
dry plate—but fall along a curve having the
centre of the lens as its centre and the focal
length of the lens as its radius. To secure
sharpness of focus at all points with such a
lens the plate would have to be concave.
Lenses with curvature of field will give an
image sharp in the middle but blurred at the
edges or sharp at the edges and blurred at the
centre, according to the distance of the focus-
ing screen from the lens. This form of aber-
ration is corrected in the better-class lenses.
* * * *
Are all blowflies females? If not, description
of male partner? —B6B7.
Both male and female blowflies exist. Care-
ful inspection of the head will show that in
the case of the male the large compound eyes
appear to meet in the front of the head, whereas
in the female there is a distinct space between
the eyes.

registered in Victoria, and having a branch in

Write to the head office in Victoria, enclosing
Is. for articles and 3d. for postage, and ask
for copy of memorandum and articles of
association.

Causes and treatment of feather-eating in
fowls ? —BBB3.
This pernicious habit is mostly found among
fowls that have been on heating and stimulant
foods and kept closely confined. Laziness from
repletion and lack of health-promoting activity
often start it, and when a bird in a batch begins
the practice others retaliate. Change the dietary,
giving abundance of green food, put short
straw on the floor and bury their corn to make
the. birds scratch for a living. Also hang up
their green food in bunches on a string and
make them jump to get it. Feather-plucking
in easily cured if the bird that does it is
looked for and when located treated surgically
by having the curved tip of her upper man-
dible clipped. This will not interfere with her
feeding, but it will prevent her getting a grip
on the feathers.

Nature and origin of the alloy pinchbeck?
—BBBl.
It is an imitation gold alloy comprising

a London toyseller named Pinchbeck in the
eighteenth century and largely used for making
watchcases and imitation jewellery.

Directions for giving an oilcloth coat a new
dressing ? —BB9O.
Dissolve loz. yellow soap in 1£ pints boil-

cold, add i-pint of gold size. Paint this on
the coat, first warming fabric and dressing.
Three coats should be applied, allowing each to
dry thoroughly before next is put on.

A few biographical details of Sir Robert
Officer?—mo.
He was born in Scotland on October 3, 1800,
and educated at St. Andrews. He came to
Tasmania in 1821, was appointed medlical
officer for New Norfolk, and built up a con-
siderable private practice. In 1853 he gave
up medical work, and was elected for Bucking-
ham to the Leg. Council. On the establish-
ment of responsible government he became
member for Glenorchy in the new Assembly
(1856). He was made Chairman of Commit-
tees and in 1861 Speaker, a post which he
held until 1877. He took special interest in
the acclimatisation of salmon and trout, and
it was mainly his influence that kept the vote
for that purpose regularly in the Budget. Re-
tiring from public life in 1877, he died at New
Norfolk on July 8, 1879.

Any information concerning fish known as
threadfins ? —8873.
Threadfins are tropical fish of the family
Polynemidce, with slender filaments beneath the
pectoral fins which can be moved freely in all
directions and may be quite short or longer
than the body of the fish itself. They are
tactile organs and enable the fish to find its
food in intensely muddy estuarine waters. A
species common in Q’land, Polynemus tetra-
dactylus, is known in the northern towns as
salmon or Cooktown salmon, though it bears
no resemblance to and has no affinity with
the true salmon of the Northern Hemisphere.
It occurs in shoals, and meets with a ready
sale in the northern markets. Threadfins rarely
extend southward to the N.S.W. coast, but are
plentiful along the northern seaboard. Some
species attain a length of 6ft.
* * * *
A brief history of the Dominican Republic ?
—8866.
Columbus discovered the island of Santo
Domingo in 1492 and called it La Espanola;
the city of Santo Domingo, founded by his
brother Bartholomew in 1496, was for long the
centre of Spanish power in America. The
western part of the island —about one-third of
the whole and now known as the Republic of
Haiti—was later occupied and colonised by the
French, to whom the Spanish colony of Santo
Domingo was also ceded in 1795. In 1808 the
Dominican population, assisted by British troops,
expelled the French, and the colony returned
to the rule of Spain, from which it declared
its independence in 1821. It was invaded and
held by the Haitians from 1822 to 1844, when
they were expelled, and the Dominican Re-
public was founded and a Constitution adopted.
The country was occupied by American
marines from 1916 to the adoption of a new
Constitution in 1924. In 1936 the name of
the capital city was changed from Santo
Domingo to Ciudad Trujillo.

A remedy for baldness ? —BBB6.
There are dozens of alleged remedies.
Nothing will have any effect if what are gener-
ally called the hair “roots” are decayed from
natural causes. However, the following cheap
and simple application is frequently helpful:
Whisk up the yolk of one fresh egg and mix
therewith an equal quantity of the squeezed
and strained juice of chopped and uncooked
Spanish onions. Add thereto as much crude
cod liver oil as the two foregoing ingredients
make together, and then whisk the whole for
fully five minutes. The resulting ointment may
be perfumed to mask its rather disagreeable
odor. It should be placed in a tight receptacle
and a little rubbed patiently into the scalp
every night, after first bathing the part well
with warm water.
* * * *
Points of a Borzoi or Russian wolfhound?
Some information regarding care of this
species ? —BBB7.
In height a male Borzoi should measure
from 29in. upwards and a female 2in. less.
The skull should be flat and narrow, and the
head generally so fine that the shape and
direction of the bones and principal veins are
clearly visible; while viewed in profile, it
should appear Roman-nosed. Generally the
dog is built on greyhound lines. White is the
prevailing color, with or without fawn, lemon,
grey, brindle, blue or black markings. Occa-
sionally self-colors are met with. Light-eyed,
short-headed, heavy-eared and heavy-shouldered
specimens are to be avoided; as are also those
having eyes wide apart or that are barrel-
ribbed or cow-hocked. On no account should
this variety be chained to a kennel, or a mis-
shapen, broken-spirited animal will result. Care,
too, must be taken in regard to any punish-
ment inflicted on a puppy, as no breed is more
sensitive or more easily spoiled by harsh treat-
ment. Damp is their great enemy; cold they
can endure with impunity. Being light-colored,
they need to be washed occasionally and brushed
and combed daily, giving special attention to
the tail and feathering. In their native country
they are used against the wolf, a brace being
able to give a very solid account of them-
selves against that beast. They can be recom-
mended both as companions and personal
guards, and at the same time make good
watchdogs.

How is chilli powder made from capsicums ?

Recipe for making candles, and where can
mould be obtained? —B7o4.
Use one-third beef suet and two-thirds
mutton fat, adding lib. alum (dissolved in
water) to each 51b. of tallow, |lb. resin melted
into each pound of tallow. Wicking is sold by
Anthony Hordern and Sons and Mark Foy’s,
Sydney. The wicks are secured in centre of
each mould by passing over thin sticks, one
laid over mould at top and the other at the
lower end. The melted tallow is poured in
and left at least six hours. The fat should
be just liquid enough to run, not boiled. For
tin moulds, write to J. Gadsden, 49 Ann-street,
Surry Hills, Sydney, or Richard Hughes,
Queen’s-road, Five Dock, Sydney ; you will have
to get the moulds made to order.

“Mark Lane”: Pictures from London
show that the part of the Tower which
was hit by bombs was the North Bastion,
behind Waterloo Barracks, covering the
inner ward opposite the Bowyer, Brick
and Martin Towers, of which the public
sees little. Some of this part is very old,
particularly the Martin Tower. It dates
from Henry IPs time, and was the scene
of Colonel Blood’s attempt to pinch the
Crown jewels. Wonder if the near-by
explosion drove out Queen Anne’s ghost,
which is supposed to haunt these parts?

Maurice Meredith Finnis, who has been
appointed lecturer in philosophy at
Adelaide Uni., is a son of H. P. Finnis,
the Bishop’s Vicar and Precentor at St.
Peter’s Cathedral. Educated at St.
Peter’s College and Adelaide Uni., Finnis
qualified for his B.A. and a studentship
in arts in 1937. Last year he went to
Oxford to continue his studies in philo-
sophy. John McKellar Stewart, the
philosophy prof., is his father-in-law.

“Cauboy”: I have seen it stated
that a speech by Jane Connolly in “No
More Comedy,” Marie Ney’s show at
the King’s, is a record for length for Mel-
bourne. In the script it totals 580 words,
cut down for the convenience of Mel-
bourne’s ear by a couple of hundred.
This is far from being a stage record.
Lady Macbeth’s soliloquy is longer;
Shaw in “Saint Joan” makes the In-
quisitor (played by Christopher Casson in
Melbourne) spout 914 words, and King
Magnus’s speech in the same author’s
“The Applecart” runs to over 1000
words. Pirandello has several stretches
of oratory exceeding 1500 words. But the
daddy of them all was Ibsen. He gives
Dr. Stockman, in “The Enemy of the
People,” an address to the mob that
measures 2500 words. It was uttered by
a Melbourne amateur at the old Play-
house without a single falter.

“King’s Inns”: Henry VIII sought no
divorce (B. 20/11/’4O). He knew too
much about canon law for that. What
he did seek was an annulment of his
marriage with Catherine of Aragon on
the ground that she was in fact his
brother’s widow. That was a perfectly
valid ground for an annulment suit
(even in the English Reformed Church
until the other day). The decision was
that Henry’s brother Arthur had not con-
summated his marriage with Catherine, so
there was in fact no marriage previous
to Catherine’s union with Henry.

“Bohemian”: This smaller world has
some good points. An Auckland (M.L.)
three-year-old child suffered from “cocks-
foot asthma”—a very dangerous phase of
hay fever. The curative serum was not
procurable in Maodland, so a cable
was sent to a Philadelphia firm which
stocked the serum. The ’plane from Phila-
delphia to ’Frisco connected with the
trans-Pacific air service, the serum arrived
in Auckland in good time —and the
child’s 'life was saved.

he collapsed, and a facsimile of the MS.

Tasmania is the only State that will

Victoria and S.A. £600,000 each, West-

There is still £1,500,000 in the fund for

the State Governments can have a cut
at that when they produce enough money
to make up the balance necessary to com-
plete the job. So far, none of them

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
The Nicotine Sulphate Drench.
“Lion”: Three years’ work on drenches
has proved nic. sulph. well over 90 p.c.
effective in controlling and cleaning up
worms. Other drenches had varying
effect. The following formula has proved
invaluable in maintaining maximum pro-
duction of wool and lambs as well as
gradually cleaning up the property.
Concentrated Solution: Two fl. oz.
nicotine sulphate (pure), 2oz. by weight
copper sulphate, 20 fl. oz. hot water.
Dissolve the c.s. crystals in the hot
water, allow to cool and add the n.s. To
make the drench, add a further 80 fl. oz.
water, cold, to the whole amount of the
concentrated solution. Keep well stirred
during use.
The drench is used through a gun
graduated in 5 c.c. doses and upwards in
the following amounts: 18 months and
over, 30 c.c. ; 12 to 18 months, 20 c.c. ;
four to 12 months, 10 c.c.; under four
months, 5 c.c.
The amount of n.s., which is a deadly
poison, in each 5 c.c. dose is approx. 1.75
minims, so that the dose for a grown
sheep contains 10.5 minims. This any
conditioned sheep should be able to take
safely under all conditions.
Set your gun on the 5 c.c. mark, then
as you go up the race each animal can
be dealt with on its merits without any
alteration to the gun, remembering that
each stroke on the piston gives 1.75
minims of pure drug.
I have used this formula on all classes
of sheep from stud rams to 14-days-old
lambs and have not lost a single sheep
while doing 2000 or over each time ; I
have lost odd sheep when increasing the
dose to 40 c.c. in obstinate cases, and to
a maximum of 45 c.c. in experimental
cases or those which refuse to respond
to treatment. In the former case it is
only 14 minims of n.s., while the latter
is 15.75 minims, and a N.S.W. Govern-
ment formula allows 15 minims to strong
sheep without any ill effect.
Effective drenching on a wormy prop-
erty must be carried out at least three
times during the year over everything
depastured there, and at each drenching
period all sheep must be done again three
weeks later in the order of original drench-
ing, so that worm eggs which hatched after
the first drench are caught by the second,
thus keeping the ground clean as well as
the sheep.
I usually drench after lamb-marking,
two months before shearing, and before
joining the ewes.
Sheep should not be starved prior to
drenching, should not be drenched hot,
and should not be allowed on to water
until four hours after drenching.
The cost of n.s. is now 11/6 per 16
fl. oz. tin, and c.s. is about 6d. to 7d.
per pound. In a word, the drench is
cheap. In three years it has cleaned up a
very wormy property for me.
N.S.W. Wool Clip.
“Ghanam”: Drought notwithstanding,
wool arrivals in Sydney market to Dec.
6 —1,025,000 bales—were only 52,970
bales short of last year’s. And Newcastle
has had more wool this year than before.
The result has come from greater sheep
numbers, not from greater cuts.
However, the grower does not score to
any extent. His maintenance expenses
have been higher than for many a year.
Though his wool price has been guaran-
teed, the results of the drought are obvi-
ous in clips, and appraisement prices are
lower in hundreds of cases than they
would have been had the season been
normal. Also, against the wool must be
charged the shearing cost of the extra
numbers shorn.
Bovine Mastitis.
“Mookau”: The C.S.I.R. has com-
pleted a complicated series of tests for
bovine mastitis.
A heifer herd coming to production
was chosen. Milk from each quarter was
"Y’ know, Ma, We 're goin' i miss Elsie!"
examined after the first week and then
fortnightly. The animals were, of course,
certified t.b.- and contagious abortion-
free in the beginning.
On the first milking 73 p.c. of 119
functioning quarters remained sterile
during the first week, and apparently high
bacterial counts in the remaining quarters
disappeared within a week. In the second
milking period, only 48 p.c. of the func-
tioning quarters were sterile in the first
week ; the rest were infected for various
periods, 39 p.c. remaining infected after
a week.
During the whole of the first period
50 p.c. remained sterile ; but only eight
out of 119 showed high bacterial counts
throughout; in the second milking, 50
p.c. were persistently unsterile. Infec-
tions due to Str. agalactice, which was
believed to produce common chronic
mastitis, were found to be transient.
However, during second lactation, it was
recovered from the milk of no fewer than
21 out of 30 cows.
The fact was established that, though
the animals were kept in perpetual quar-
antine from maidenhood, the strepto-
coccus made its appearance and caused
several clinical mastitis cases. Other
bacteria which cause mastitis also
dropped in. The infections of all types
were evenly spread, but it was noted
that some forms caused more tissue
damage than others.
Generally, where one quarter was
affected in production by the disease,
others tended to make up the deficiency.
Infective incidence seemed to be higher
in lower-producing animals, though data
were not sufficient to justify a final con-
clusion.
The C.S.I.R. pamphlet on the research
is exhaustive and learned.
Pastures and Butter.
“Alstonner”: On 60 acres of “big-
scrub” country in the far northern
coastal country of N.S.W., R. K. McLeay
stepped up his butter-production from
551 b. to 1001 b. an acre in five years.
McLeay grows no fodder crops, but
half his area is under improved pastures.
A bit of new land is broken up and
sown with Poona cowpeas every season,
the peas being turned in for green
manure. Though on steep slopes, there
is no danger of erosion so long as the
ploughing is done across the slope. The
pasture paddocks are well limed with up
to a ton to the acre when first broken
up, and superphosphate is freely used
when the pastures are sown.
A M.L. strain of Italian rye, sown at
201 b. to the acre, is the annual pasture,
the perennial being established on 41b.
of Phalaris tuber osa, 31b. of Akaroa
cocksfoot and 21b. each of white and
red clover an acre; this turns out an
ample early-winter supply, the Italian rye
galloping away from the phalaris, which
follows on when most needed. McLeay,
who is on red volcanic soil, swears by
phalaris, and, after one or two years of
cultivation for annual pastures and cow-
peas, hopes to have phalaris on every
ploughable bit of the place.
A Skeleton-weed Rotation.
“Big Bin”: W. Giles, a Temora
(N.S.W.) farmer, has worked out a wheat,
no stubble-burn, layland and fallow
rotation that offers some hope of handling
skeleton weed and turning it to profit.
It doesn’t mean that the weed is
eradicated ; rather that it becomes one
of the farm plants, plays a part in feeding
the sheep and so serves a purpose. All
the same, it has to be done carefully, as
any slackness would let it jump away
and dominate the paddocks.
After the crop is stripped the stubble is
given over to sheep. By the following
autumn, in a normal season, there is a
fair growth of clover and skeleton weed,
which the sheep have during winter.
After the paddock has lain out for the
next 12 months, fallowing begins in
spring, and sheep and further workings
bring it on ready for the wheat seeding
the following autumn. Thus from one
wheat crop to the next is three years.
The main idea is building up of clovers
and other pastures, also the sheep num-
bers. It is estimated that a single sheep
drops half a ton of manure a year, so
subdivision and management can con-
centrate this manure where it is wanted
from time to time, and the general effect
is a restoration of fertility. Under the
system a summer that causes a quick
growth of skeleton weed actually benefits
the owner with good sheep feed.
Many of Giles’s neighbors are follow-
ing the idea with good results. It simply
recognises the weed as part of the farm,
uses it to best advantage and at the
same time keeps it from taking charge.
Conserving Wheaten Hay.
“Graz”: During this last drought I fed
lucerne, oaten, barley and wheaten hay
to sheep. The least waste was with
wheaten. Mice and rats badly damaged

the oaten and barley hay, but did not
trouble the wheaten. To get this result
the hay must be fine-strawed and cut
green.
Under Dr. Earle Page’s fodder con-
servation plan, farmers will be obliged
to cut a stipulated acreage of wheat for
hay in seasons when it becomes evident
that Australia’s output of wheat will ex-
ceed 140,000,000 bushels for sale through
the board, plus seed and feed require-
ments.
Farmers will be paid at ton rates for
hay, and this will tempt many to grow
heavy hay varieties and to let it ripen
well before cutting to get full weight.
Such hay would have to be protected
from pests; it would have to be chaffed to
get sheep to eat it, and this would mean
providing troughs. Getting it to the
sheep’s mouth would cost about £2 10s.
per ton more than for fine-strawed green
hay.
Cheap fodder is the essence of a suc-
cessful conservation scheme, and this can
be provided by machine-pressing hay of
a quality which stock will eat readily
when spread over the paddocks. Cut
green, the sugar dries in—not out of —
the stems, and the hay is palatable.
Stock Foods and Medicines Act.
“Bungaree”: The Act has been
gazetted in N. S. Wales, and after a date
to be notified—probably early in 1941
all stock foods, licks, dips, fly dressings,
drenches, vaccines and other medicines
will have to comply with regulations.
Registration of products is under way
—fodders and licks being tackled first
—and every such product will have to
carry a label of registration, showing
certain particulars and analyses of con-
tents.
Each bale, bag or package of stock
food must carry a label showing the
name of the manufacturer or State dis-
tributor and the words “Registered
under the Stock Foods and Medicines
Act 1940 (N.5.W.).” It must also state
(a) minimum percentage of crude pro-
tein, ( b) minimum percentage of crude
fat, (c) maximum percentage of crude
fibre and also percentage of salt, if any,
in the article. The actual ingredients of
every prepared food must be shown on
the label or on the invoice.
Proprietary salt licks must bear a label
carrying registration, name of manufac-
turer, with maximum percentage of salt
and minimum percentage of phosphoric
acid, lime, magnesia and other mineral
constituents.
So far as food and licks are con-
cerned registration alone will convey
little evidence of value. The Act
merely forces the manufacturer to state
the component parts —not the quantities
of each—and, unless something is done to
educate the average man on the land in
animal nutrition, the Act will offer no
guide as to what he should or should
not buy. Two manufacturers may use
exactly the same materials, but one may
use larger proportions of the high-pro-
tein article and the other may include a
larger percentage of “filling.”
With stock medicines the board may
exercise its power to confine registra-
tion to reliable products. When applying
for registration the manufacturer must
supply the prescription of his product
and what it is claimed to do. If registra-
tion is granted only a line to that effect
may be printed on the package and the
buyer will be no wiser than before as to
constituents.
The efficacy of the Act will depend
on the decision of the board on the
medicines it allows to be registered and
on the policing of sales. A manufacturer
may not advertise or claim for his oro-
ducts anything more than is contained
in the list of claims submitted to the
board.
Hints for the Farm.
“Trooper”: If pigs develop a cough or
“thump” they may have round worms
{Ascans lumbricoid.es). The worms vary
in length from 6in. (small male) to 16in.
(large female), and are from |in. to l-sin.
thick. They mainly attack pigs under
five months old. The eggs develop in
the faeces and pass to the intestine,'
thence through the wall of the intestine
to the lungs via the bloodstream and the
liver; or else through to the peritonal
cavity. If the pig is over six weeks old,
give 1 c.c. of oil of chenopodium in 2oz.
to 4oz. of castor oil for every 251 b. live-
weight, maximum dose 4 c.c. oil of cheno-
podium, or else i-gram santonin per 2.41 b.

weight of pig. Starve pig 12 to 14 hours
before treatment and four hours after
treatment.
“Y.N.”: Good housing is as necessary
for poultry as good feeding. Have the
perches not less than 20in. apart and
allow at least 7in. of space per bird,
otherwise you’ll have overheating and
perhaps untimely moults. Ventilation is
important. Have a gap about 6in. wide
along the top of the back wall, under
the roof, to let in plenty of air for hot
days and nights. A canvas or hessian
blind can be used to cover it in winter.
“R. Rina”: Bordan, the newly-
recommended wheat that has done so
well in better-rainfall parts of the
N.S.W. wheatbelt, has pleased Riverina
growers who cut it for hay. Most of
them got two tons an acre, and the hay
brought top prices. In grain-yield trials
around Albury, Bordan has outyielded
Ford by a bag to the acre in the past
four years.
“Juppa”: From 2d. for some samples
of Bencubbin and 3d. for Waratah, the
crop weather this year caused certain
wheat to bring premiums as high as Is.
6d. a bushel—this for some Gulargam-
bone (N.S.W.) Pusa. The good wheat
seems to be coming chiefly from around
Dubbo, where Pusa has gone 66y1b.,
Ford 671 b. and a lot of other wheat
631 b. to 641 b. to the bushel, mostly early-
maturing varieties. Many farmers have
obtained premiums of 6d. and 7d. a
bushel.
“Cownurse”: Except in the five years
1920-25, and in the ’nineties, Queensland
has never had more cattle than now, the
figures at 1/1/’4O being nearly 6,200,000
head. Biggest increase took place in the
centre and south, and in the latter there
was also a big sheep increase, bringing
the State total to 24,190,931, the highest
in history. Pigs, too, multiplied, especially
in the Moreton, Maryborough and
Downs districts, nearly 400,000 of them
grunting and snorting about the place.
j increase is common to Victoria
and S.A., where, as in Queensland, big
stocks and low prices for wheat have
probab i y contribute d to it. It seems
ra t be r significant that between 1930 and
1937, when wheat prices were rising, pig
numbers declined,

“Yeno Ham”: On pasture only, with
no supplementary feed, 58 cows, owned
by Mrs. H. Gradwell, Nimbin (N.S.W.),
increased production by 25 per cent, in
1939-40, compared with the previous
year’s figures. Italian rye-grass and red
clover are used as temporary pastures,
giving two years’ grazing, permanent
swards being perennial rye-grass, cocks-
foot, red and white clovers; super, is
applied at sowing and as an annual top-
dressing ; sulphate of ammonia two or
three times during winter and spring
stimulates growth. Harrow and renovator
are used whenever surface soil becomes
compacted or manure needs spreading.
“J. Want”: Maoriland Agricultural
Department is having a few words to say
about Kikuyu grass. It has been found
that when the grass is put down on
very fertile land it develops an alarming
spread. Shoots go up to seven feet long,
with a couple of dozen joints, each one
of which is capable of starting a new
plant. It should be worth consideration
on sand-dunes. The best way to estab-
lish it is in a third stage —first marram
grass, then yellow lupins, then give the
Kikuyu a start under lupin cover.
“Granova”: The N.S.W. Soil Conser-
vation Commission has established a
research station at Cowra, where erosion
of cultivation land is threatening, and
at Goulburn it is working on erosion
of hilly grazing country, particularly in
the Burrinjuck catchment area. Land-
owners about to start reclamation work
can obtain the services of a surveyor
from the Commission. He will map the
farm showing what land can be used for
cultivation, grazing or reafforestation.
The location of waterways and contour
banks will be shown. While contour
banks are needed to reclaim badly-
eroded land, on steep cultivation land
they are minor factors in preventing
erosion. Wise land use, rotations which
build up the fertility of the soil, pasture
improvement, careful stocking and tree-
planting are more important.
“Double One”: Some years ago I
found a patch of hoary cress about 13
yards in diameter. The Victorian Agri-
cultural Department told me that I could
eradicate it by hoeing it every fortnight
for two years. I was not to allow it to
show any green leaves. In spite of rain,
hail, floods, sicknesses, deaths and
funerals, I followed these instructions to
the letter, and obtained 100 p.c. kill. If
landowners readily attacked it by this
method as soon as it appeared its spread
could be soon prevented.
“J.E.D.”: Farm manures (B. 4/12/’40)?
I have watched peasants in Alsace-
Lorraine preparing manure before apply-
ing it to the soil. Armed with hay forks,
a pair of workers stand one on each side
of a manure heap, tossing the manure
from one to the other in order to ensure
thorough aeration. This process is con-
tinued for hours, after which the manure
is carefully and evenly spread over the
land. And on small holdings south of
Fremantle (W.A.) emigrants have got
equally remarkable results by the same
methods.
Outback Occupations.
No. XLVIII.
AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.
Young Tom is the first to report.
“Snake!” he pants. “Dived under the
house near the tank!”
Your wife gives a faint scream, and
you get up and go outside, and bend and
peer into the cobwebby darkness under
the house. A movement catches your
eye, and you call to Tom to bring you
his pea-rifle. This you sight carefully on
that dim object and squeeze the trigger.
There is a click, and you throw the rifle
behind you, saying “Why didn’t y’ load
the flamin’ thing?” Tom gulps, picks up
the firearm and earnestly examines it for
damages.
Jack, your elder son, comes up silently,
surveys you with some astonishment and
asks, “Lost somethin’, Dad?”
“There’s a flamin’ great snake under
here,” you snap.
Jack gets a pitchfork and pokes hard
under the house. There is a scuffle, and
the family cat rushes out and vanishes
into the house. You pull yourself up-
right. “That settles it; no snake will
stay where there’s a cat.”
Two days later your wife comes hur-
riedly up the paddock and reports that
she has just seen the snake diving under
the house near the tank, and she’s not
going to stay in the place a moment
longer unless you get it out.
Getting a snake out from under a
house isn’t the easiest proposition. You
can’t very well go under and drag him
out with your bare hands, nor is it any
use to use a coaxing tone and call “Snake,
snake, come on, kerp, kerp.” So you
accompany her back to the house, think-
ing hard.
You try a saucer of milk, putting it
on the ground near the tank and mount-
ing guard with a shotgun. Time passes;
the missus goes in and out; whenever
one of the boys heaves in sight he yells
“Seen him yet?” As though you’d still
be there if you had.
After a time you go in to get a match.
The missus gets you to help her shift a
table. When you come out there is not
a vestige of snake in sight. Determinedly
you keep watch, certain the milk will
bring him.
About sunset you stretch yourself and
go to bring the saucer in. It is empty.
Either the snake or the cat drank the milk
while you were shifting the table. Word-
lessly you sit down to tea, eyeing the cat
washing its face on the doorstep.
That night you catch the cat and put
it under a box. You chain up the dogs.
Then you prepare a dish of milk and
strychnine, put it near the tank and retire.
The missus insists on keeping the bed-
room windows and door shut. You stifle.
But she is afraid the snake will come
for her in the night or something. Some-
how you sleep. Next morning the milk
is gone. So are two bush cats, a fantail
pigeon and a frilled lizard. You take
them away and bury them.
“Betcha,” says Jack, “that snake got
some of the milk and is dead under the
house. You wait till he starts t’ stink.”
You wait. But there is no smell. The
missus reports several eggs missing, and
suddenly the cat takes to watching a
crack in the floor. You go outside and
peer under the house, shine an electric
torch into the darkness. There are many
things under your house, but you cannot
see a snake.
By this time your wife is a bundle of
nerves. She refuses to leave the house
after dark, and peers all round before
going out even by day. The slightest
rustle of paper, a creak in a wall, a drift
of wind along the wallpaper almost gives
her hysterics. You begin to feel uncer-
tain yourself. Unless something is done
the confounded snake will drive you from
home.
You and the boys get some flat galvan-
ised iron and close up the space between
walls and ground all the way round
except at one spot, where you leave a
small opening. This is closed at night
and left open under constant guard by
day. Saucers of milk are used freely.
Stopping the gap with iron has stopped
the flow of air under the house, which
becomes hot and stuffy.
Days pass without result. Then you
decide to take the offensive. Soaking
some horse-balls in carbon bisulphide,
you throw them well under the house
and hurriedly close up the small opening.
By teatime the gas is coming up through
the floor and everybody gets a headache.
By bedtime the house reeks, and nobody
dares strike a match.
You open up some of the flat iron on
opposite sides and let the air in to clear
out the gas. An army of beetles, cock-
roaches, mice, small lizards, spiders, ants
and other fauna hurriedly evacuate
through the openings. The snake does
not come.
You say “There can’t be any snake.
All them insects and things wouldn’t be
under there with a snake.”
“I saw the thing,” your wife insists.
“So did I,” says Tom.
“Well,” you confess, “short of burnin’
the place down, I don’t see how we’re
goin’ t’ get him out.”
“That’s it,” yelps Jack suddenly.
“Smoke him out. Get a fire-tin and
plenty of green bushes an’ smoke him
out.”
You won’t have this. An argument
develops. None of you observes the cat,
which has dragged a 2ft. brown snake
from under the tank and is playing with
it near Jack. Tom sees it first and lets
out a yell ; Jack jumps four feet in the
air and scares the cat. And your poor,
nerve-racked, hysterical wife calmly
belts the serpent with a hammer and then
kicks it off the verandah.
“Poor little thing,” she says.


THE OTHER
FELLOW'S
MIND.
The contributor placed first is paid at the rate of 4|d. per line; all others at
2ld. per line.
On top this week is a Westralian who has no use for the Hoover plan.
The Plight of the Conquered
Ex-President Hoover persists in his
proposal to collect and distribute relief to
the people under German military domi-
nation in Poland, Norway, Holland, Bel-
gium and occupied France. Cunning use
will be made of the Hoover effort by the
German propaganda machine, and there
will be little regard for consistency.
The German official newsagency has
declared on more than one occasion that
there are ample food supplies in Ger-
many and in the occupied countries,
while the Minister for Agriculture at
Vichy says there is abundance of food-
stuffs in unoccupied France. We are
never likely to have trustworthy statistics
as to the grain production of the coun-
tries of north-western Europe in 1940; but,
allowing for poorer crops, all these coun-
tries would have had sufficient supplies
to see them through to 1941. France had
a carryover of 60 million bushels of
wheat, and international wheat trade was
heavier in the cereal years 1938-39 and
1939-40 on account of purchases of
security stocks by all the occupied coun-
tries. Where have these supplies gone?
The German authorities make no pre-
tence of keeping up an appearance of
benevolent care of the people under their
heel, and there is not even a temporary
use of the velvet glove. They requisi-
tioned 3,000,000 pigs in Denmark which
supplemented the meat supply in Ger-
many. A military decree in Belgium en-
forces a reduction of 50 per cent, in the
land used for pasturage of dairy stock,
and this superfluous stock goes into the
German meat supply. The position in
the Danubian countries is even more illu-
minating. Hungary, Rumania, Yugo-
slavia and Bulgaria had substantial ex-
portable surpluses of wheat in 1938 and
1939 and exported 82 million bushels in
the cereal year 1939-40. Free from in-
timidation they had sufficient supplies of
grain to supplement the poorer yields in
1940. Actually, their populations are to
be on short commons and strict regula-
tion in order to squeeze supplies for Ger-
many.
In circumstances such as these Mr.
Hoover could only administer relief to
the people of the occupied countries, and
ensure that the deserving had the bene-
fit, if backed by an adequate army carry-
ing up-to-date weapons of persuasion.
For two very convincing reasons —
commonsense and self-preservation—
Britain cannot acquiesce in what would
be direct aid to the enemy.
From another point of view, Mr.
Hoover’s proposal would be a direct
encouragement to international brigand-
age.
The human material that Hitler is
using in his Blitzkrieg consists of the chil-
dren who were fed by American and
British benevolence in the last post-war
period. Mr. Hoover was head of the
Commission for Relief.
From August, 1914, to July, 1923,
total relief distributed to peoples affected
by war, including Germany and Austria,
cost a grand total of 5,234,028,208
dollars, or roughly about one thousand
million pounds. The Society of Friends
was one of the most active in this work
of relief. In June, 1921, its members
were supplying supplementary meals to
1,026,856 German children. During five
months of the Armistice period in 1919,
1,215,217 tons of foodstuffs, valued at
282 million dollars, were sent into Ger-
many for purposes of relief. A very
large amount of relief was distributed
by British Quakers in German territory
under British occupation. The main pur-
pose of all this benevolent aid was to
succor the children and provide nourish-
ment for expectant and nursing mothers.
By the curse of fanaticism, this salvage is
the enslaved instrument by which death
and destruction are carried to innocent
millions while famine rides behind.
Only by the grace of grim endurance
and eleventh-hour unity has Britain
staved off this fate. Mr. Hoover’s pro-
posal might turn the scales against her,
since fanaticism has no heart. —B. T. li.
(W.A.).
A Worker
The term “worker,” so much bandied
about by politicians and agitators, is
meant to denote a vast army of wage
slaves whose livelihood depends upon the
sweat of their brows and the whims of
cruel bosses. But what fiction is this!
Watch a group of roadmenders or a
railway maintenance gang, or watch any
employees of the so-called “worker”
type. They work eight hours a day, and
even spend some of that in talk and idle-
ness.
The real workers in this or any other
country are not the pick-and-shovel men
but members of the groups which they
affect to despise, The student burning
the midnight oil, the doctor at his
patients’ disposal 24 hours per day, the
many voluntary helpers striving to aid
the Empire’s war effort; above all,
the mothers who work as much as 16
hours a day unselfishly for their homes
and families, and for whom no arbitra-
tion awards exist.
The term “worker” should be reserved
for anyone who does a decent day’s toil,
and it certainly can never be the prero-
gative of one class. —E. J. B. (N.S.W.).
Labor and Unionism
“Fitzjay’s” tirade against Labor and
unionism (B. 27/11 / ’4O) is typical of
frequent attacks against representatives
and organisations of the working class.
If he were to cast back to the days before
the existence of a Labor party and com-
pared conditions then with what they are
now he would surely think again.
It is through the efforts of organised
Labor —unionism —that the worker has
been raised from the level of a slave. Does
“Fitzjay” know of the ghastly conditions
under which shearers, miners, seamen
and all menials labored? Human beings
were mere chattels or units of produc-
tion. Loud were the wails of the master
class when it recognised the inevitability
of the advent of organised Labor.
The history of Labor has been tor-
tuous, and in many ways Labor has
failed in the fulfilment of its ideals, often
through the treachery of leading mem-
bers and often through the strangleholds
exerted by monopolists of finance and
industry.
But what unbiased mind would refer
to arbitration, old-age pensions, higher
pay for soldiers and their dependants
and an endeavor to relieve this country
of the impediment of the money baron
as quackery?
Many unions may savor of dictator-
ships, but there must be restraint, order
and discipline, for without these union-
ism would cease to exist. I have been
to many union meetings and have never
seen “jackals howling” or scenes of vio-
lence. These things may occur, but more
because of the cussedness of human
nature than because of unionism.— Fargo
(Q-).
A Job for the Unions
There does not appear to be any
legal objection to a union indulging in
trading for the benefit of its members
(B. 4/12/’4O). In fact the Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Act speci-
fically provides for the incorporation of
workers’ and other organisations. By
Section 58,
Every organisation registered under this
Act shall for the purposes of this Act have
perpetual succession and a common seal,
and may purchase, take on lease, hold, sell,
lease, mortgage, exchange, and otherwise
own, possess and deal with any real or per-
sonal property.
In other words, unions registered under
the Act can act like other corporate
bodies.
If unionists believe in ownership by
the workers for the benefit of the
workers, why don’t they try it in prac-
tice? Some Australian organisations
have spent hundreds of thousands of
pounds—all saved by workers —on strikes
which have got them nowhere. The same
money spent on co-operative stores, hos-
pitals and houses would have given
something substantial and lasting for
their efforts and would have lightened
the burden of many workers’ wives.
Unions which could make a success of
their own co-operative affairs would
have a far better chance than they have
at present of convincing the Australian
public that socialisation of industry
would be a blessing and not a curse. —
WUSSLEAN (Vic.).
Education
That was a very sad tale about
Matilda (B. 20/11 /’4o)—young people
these days do run the risk of moral in-
digestion. While the old hush-hush ideas
certainly did not offer the best equipment
for mental well-being, it seems a pity,
apart from the waste of a climate so
admirably suited to outdoor life, that
on Saturday after Saturday our picture
theatres are thronged with children
watching films that were intended for
adult entertainment —and, often, for poor
adult taste at that.
There are, however, many young people
who go indiscriminately to moving pic-
tures, who devour the newspapers and
periodicals with their questionable adver-
tisements, and yet retain a healthy out-
look. It speaks well for our educational
system that this can be so, but the sad
thing is that education for many is so
limited. Those more fortunate young-
sters who have plenty of scope for de-
veloping their creative and other mental
faculties, as well as physical development
in outdoor sport, can usually take a
sprinkling of the other stuff without harm
and learn to digest it by degrees.
For the less fortunate, though, educa-
tion is considered to be complete with
the gaining of the qualifying certificate.
Then those parents who have failed alto-
gether to see the value of much that was
done at school will fail to see how edu-
cation can be extended by various in-
terests after schooldays are over. They
may fail also to exert any helpful per-
sonal influence, and so another immature
mind is launched defenceless upon this
world. —M. A. R. (S.A.).
The trouble with education is that it
is usually “merely the training for liveli-
hood” (B. 20/11/ ’4O). We train horses
to work, and nothing more; surely
children are more than horses. If liveli-
hood is all that people are worth educat-
ing for, then the sooner we invent
mechanical gadgets to do everything in
life, or train chimpanzees to do our work
for us, the better. Then we can relapse
into complete ignorance and lack of cul-
ture and abolish education altogether.
Man’s only true progress occurs in mat-
ters apart from livelihood. To look on
livelihood as the chief end of education
is to look on that progress as absolutely
worthless, — Hack (S.A.).
The one thing education authorities
refuse to recognise is individuality. Chil-
dren in primary schools, for instance,
have to learn to write to a set standard,
which is all right while they are in the
kindergarten stage. But by the time they
approach the nine-year-old their indi-
viduality begins to show and they have a
desperate job to keep their handwriting
standard. Still, the syllabus refuses to
recognise this development, and a child
who wins high marks for other work will
lose them because his writing, though
quite legible and often expressing latent
power, doesn’t concur with the template,
or pattern, or mould, or whatever it is the
Education Department churns its writing
model from. —J. K. O. (N.S.W.).
Tough Spin
Vinegrowers (B. 27/11/ ’4O) have cer-
tainly had a cow of a time at the hands of
Governments which put many of them, as
returned Diggers, on the land. The Gov-
ernments encouraged them year in and
year out to grow thousands upon thou-
sands of tons of grapes for winemaking,
but the same Governments will not allow
them to sell wine to the people.
But whether you sell your wine or not
you must go on paying what you owe
them or you’ll be kicked off your block.
The way out is universal bottle licenses
for grocers in all States. Hotels are
largely controlled by breweries, which are
more interested in beer. — Jael (S.A.).
Town and Country
I won’t have it that all true Australians
(B. 6/11/ ’4O) are outback any more than
that “the real Australia” is that area that
lie in the lOin.-and-under rainfall area.
A false romanticism has grown up about
the vast open spaces. And as for “Law-
son’s Australia” being the same outback,
that is rubbish. Lawson’s Australia was
the whole continent, Sydney and Perth
as well as Leeton and Bourke.
Your true Australian is a man of the
town or the country, and to be found in
either. — Australl (S.A.).
Wool
“Marthaguy” (B. 20/11/’4O) takes no
account of present world conditions.
Actually, Australia is very fortunate in
that she has received such a high price
for her wool and that Britain is buying
her whole production. Without the
British contract all our wool could not be
sold, and for that part sold we would
receive prices below the fixed price. Our
woolgrowers would be in much the same
position as our wheatgrowers.
Australia must face the unpleasant fact
that, under existing conditions, the supply
of wool available is greater than the
demand for it. During the 1914-18 war,
all available wool was needed to clothe
British, French, Belgian, Italian and
American soldiers, and to export in the
form of finished products. Japan then
was not a serious competitor in these
markets, and British export trade, par-
ticularly to Europe, was maintained.
Today, a far different situation exists.
The English mills are slack and many
wool textile workers are unemployed.
Australian wool is not being used to any
great extent, as crossbred, not merino,
wool is needed most by the military.
Last season inferior South African
wool was selling at a higher price on the
open market than Australia was receiv-
ing for her wool from Britain. But this
higher price was due to the fact that
Britain had bought the Australian and
Maoriland clips, which were then not
available to other buyers. With the loss
of European buyers, South Africa was
very glad to enter into a contract with
Britain for the sale of her wool at a
much lower price than she obtained for
her clip last year.—R. H. S. (N.S.W.).
In a Chinese Cafe
I was sitting in a Chinese cafe in
Melbourne when an Australian woman,
armed with a pastepot and followed by
the phlegmatic Chinese proprietor, came
in and started to paste stickers on the
wall exhorting all friends of China to help
"Put three lumps o' sugar in it, ’Erb ?”


the Chinese. With the legend there was a
sad picture of starving Chinese children.
The lady was evidently resuming the
campaign started soon after Japan began
hostilities in China. The slaughter at
Shanghai and the bombings and the
doings of the Japanese armies made
a powerful appeal to the emotions
of Australians, and, if the emotions were
all we had to go on, helping China would
be a natural proceeding for all sympa-
thetic people.
The Japanese succeeded in driving the
Chinese from their ancient seaboard as
far as Chungking on the Upper Yangtze,
but all this did was to make it necessary
for the Chinese to become inventive. For
thousands of years they had been content
with coolie tracks to carry their brick
tea trade to India and Russia. But the
closing of the sea route forced them to
make a titanic effort, and they built the
Burma Road at an enormous cost in
lives and effort. The Japanese retaliated
by invading Indo-China, which forced the
Chinese to become more inventive, and
they have just announced with pride the
opening of a new road to Russia after
a frightful struggle against snow, ice,
wind, hunger and disease and an almost
impenetrable range of mountains. It took
3000 workers six months to cut 60 miles
of the road through rock at a height
of 10,000 feet through one of the most
terrible passes in Asia, but the Japanese
invasion made the Chinese think it was
worth it.
The road is wanted for the transport
of munitions, and the munitions are
wanted to blast the Japanese out of
China. So all the Japanese have done
is to engender an immense hatred in the
Chinese and given them the wherewithal
to vent it. All hatred has to be paid for.
Seated at the table in the cafe was a
peaceful-looking Dane. In the course of
conversation he told me that, although
he and his country had nothing to gain
from a victory by Hitler, his first emotion
when he heard of a reverse to the British
arms was one of pleasure. He could not
understand it, but after thinking a bit he
ventured the opinion that his emotion was
simply a memory of the Battle of Copen-
hagen. Nelson destroyed a Danish fleet
so that the English could impose a
blockade on the Scandinavian countries,
not because they wanted to hurt
Danes, Swedes and Norwegians, but
because they wanted to counter Napo-
leon.
I suppose there is such a thing as
racial memory; and if the emotions
engendered in his ancestors by a battle
he had merely heard of could affect their
descendant, now an Australian citizen,
how much hatred must the Japanese be
storing up for themselves in China which
will have to be paid for both by Japan-
ese and Chinese?
In the process China may become
another military nation just as strong, if
not stronger, just as determined and cer-
tainly richer and more numerous. — Feng
Shui (Vic.).
Grass Pirates
Legislation is urgently needed to com-
bat the practice of “putting stock on the
roads” during drought-time, instead of
agisting them. Not only are the stock
routes being denuded of feed for bona
fide travelling stock, but drovers often
travel less than the required six miles
per day.
If legislation were brought in provid-
ing imprisonment without the option of
a fine for drovers evading the law, and
making the owner also liable to prosecu-
tion, this type of grass pirate would be
speedily brought under control. — Pierrot
(N.S.W.).
Australian Opals
The war boom in marriages and
engagements has naturally benefited the
jewellery trade. Since the fall of Hol-
land, however, jewellers have been hard
put to cope with the increased demand
for imported cut and polished gems, as
stocks are limited and further supplies
dubious.
As we are restricting our purchases of
imported articles, an excellent substitute
for imported diamonds in engagement
rings could be good Australian opals. I
have several beautiful specimens collected
from White Cliffs (N.S.W.) some years
ago which would do justice to the hand
of any Australian girl.— Noham (N.S.W.).
Relieving Congestion
Why can’t enterprising Governments
or large manufacturing concerns, when
building factories outside the metropoli-
tan area, buy up a large slice of neigh-
boring land and settle those workers
who like the idea on three-acre blocks?
They could grow their own vegetables
and fruit in spare time and either lower
their living costs or add to their income.
It would get them out of the slums, put
more people on the land, tide them over
periods of unemployment and give them
some security.
I read that over 2,000,000 people are
on such schemes in the U.S.A. When-
ever a new one is started there are thou-
sands of keen applicants. Roosevelt’s
Government took 50 mining families a
few miles out from the town at Granger,
built decent, well-equipped homes at
reasonable costs and allowed the worker-
farmers 20 years to pay the purchase
price. It was 90 per cent, successful, and
revolutionised the lives of these people.
—Free Australia (Vic.).
Municipal Methods
I live on the border of two Melbourne
suburban municipalities. There is a wide
street connecting them, with a bridge over
the creek which separates them. Recently
a cluster of potholes developed in the
road on each side of the bridge. They
became so bad that something had to be
done.
One day a gang of men, with a truck
or two of roadmaking material, a smok-
ing tar cart and steam-roller, came along
and patched the holes on one side of the
bridge. They then shovelled up the sur-
plus metal, etc., and went away, tar cart
and all, leaving the holes on the other
side of the bridge untouched —although
with the supplies and plant and men on
the spot they could have fixed the bad
“ S’prisin' what a difference trees make to a place, Tummas .”
patches on the other side of the bridge
in a few hours.
Nothing was done on the other side
for two or three weeks, until the growls
of motorists and other road users became
so blistering that the other council had
to send its own gang of road men, tar
truck, steam-roller, trucks of metal, etc.,
to patch up its side of the bridge.
If these suburban municipal councils
will not amalgamate—and there is every
reason why many of them should —the
through streets which lead from suburb
to suburb or from suburb to city should
be taken away from the control of local
Bumbles and placed under the Country
Roads Board or some similarly consti-
tuted body.—J. G. (Vic.).
Book Tax
When a country starts taxing culture
and knowledge it is looking for trouble,
and the sales tax on books, contained in
the new Budget, is a dangerous step. Its
pecuniary returns could never outweigh
even the most obvious disadvantages.
Before the war the price of books in Aus-
tralia was nearly half as much again as
in England, and these new proposals
would be crippling to the student and
booklover.
It is, unfortunately, only from books
published overseas that most students can
get the information they require and the
textual knowledge necessary to pass our
examinations, which are all modelled on
overseas standards. Students at universi-
ties and parents with children at high
schools and colleges will vouch for the
exorbitant outlay necessary for any
course. Some of the books I have used in
my studies this year cost over £2 each.
Medical and scientific works are mostly
worth many times that.
The cultural value of books is tradi-
tional, and in this world gone mad cul-
ture holds out the sole hope of future
rehabilitation. The greatest blow dealt
by Hitler to the future of Germany was
his attitude to learning, music, art and
literature. —Pip (Vic.).
Sydney’s Milk
Interference with the normal flow of
trade of any kind by the erection of
boards (to control what they are very
pleased to call “orderly marketing”) has
a very bad effect on trade generally and
causes the business to fall into the hands
of a monopoly. Competition is the
life of trade, and prices must be con-
trolled by the law of supply and demand
—when there is a glut, get rid of the
surplus and prices will automatically
right themselves. There should be no
talk of “blocked” milk runs any more
than blocked bread or drapery or
grocery runs. Why should any person
in a free country be compelled by law
to buy from any specified milkman?
The Government should, of course,
see that a standard be fixed as to purity
—its inspectors should check up on any
article under the Pure Foods Act —but
competitive prices will do the rest. As
far as milk is concerned there is no
reason for the Milk Board or anybody
else to bring milk from as far afield as
Taree, Dungog and Jerry’s Plains.
If left to their own business the
suburban dairymen and others in the
business already in places like Picton,
Penrith, Windsor, Camden and Dapto
can supply all the fresh, pure dairy milk
that Sydney needs —they bought those
farms with that idea—and in these days
of fast motor traffic and quick delivery
there is no need for pasteurised or bottled
milk.
As for the waste of time and heavy
expense incurred by royal commis-
sions of inquiry into the price of milk,
the public, of course, has to pay. Do
away with the heavy cost of the Milk
Board (and its staff of inspectors, clerks
and palatial offices), and do away with
the huge cost of bottling plants and
bottles—do away with those and the
the public would get cheaper and
better milk. Raw Milk Drinker
(N.S.W.).
Gumleaf Music
Yesterday a gumleaf player came into
the street and simultaneously the house-
holders deserted their wireless sets to
listen to him. They stayed till he had
played his two tunes, and all responded
when the hat went the rounds.
The A.B.C. has on its payroll a hill-
billy comedian who features in its Aus-
tralia-wide hook-up, and a Maori singer
who performs at camp concerts. Surely
they could find room for this gumleaf
virtuoso. He is as Australian as the
koala, and anyone who has heard him
will vouch for his entertainment value. —
Paddy M. (N.S.W.).
Different Prices
A few months ago I bought a wireless
set. It was priced originally at nearly
£3O, but not wanting to pay that price
I saw a friend who had a brother in the
trade. I got the set for £23. Afterwards
I bought an electric toaster, catalogued
at 255., and through another friend
got it for 19s. 6d. On both occa-
sions the retailer made a reasonable
profit, so the quoted prices must have
been exorbitant.
In Melbourne merchants of electrical
goods made their own terms. There now
has been passed the State Electricity
Commission Trading Bill allowing the
corporation to compete against them.
With this real competition in the field,
Mr. Consumer and I may get a more
reasonable deal.
It is not pleasant to see private enter-
prise so interfered with, but if the case
of those electrical retailers can serve as
a warning to others it will be worth while.
—Pip (Vic.).
The Friendly Australian
It is easy to make facile comments like
“Waratah’s” (B. 13/11/ ’4O) anent the
alleged friendliness of Australians.
Admittedly our background and pioneer
tradition have given us a frankness, sim-
plicity and dislike of formalities which
we rightly cherish. But that early back-
ground is fading, and imported values
are beginning to react on national char-
acter.
The truth is that class distinction is
rampant in Australia. The worker
who gets “dirty” or the slavey who runs
Mrs. Bighouse’s home will tell you many
revealing facts. So will the fruit-pickers
or the farmhands, who experience more
unfriendliness than is generally acknow-
ledged. The small outback township no
less than the city has adopted snob-
values. The popularity of the adjective
“common” and the increasing number of
gate notices bearing the haughty words
“Tradesmen’s Entrance” are significant.
Overseas visitors may be impressed
with our general kindness and courtesy,
but very many Australians will admit
that these strangers get gushing welcomes
which have their root in the host’s in-
feriority feelings. The repressed con-
tempt and pettiness are too often directed
on locals. I sometimes wonder if the
popularity of the pub in conversation and
literature has its basis in the fact that
over a pot of beer the naturally jovial,
talkative, good-hearted Australian feels
he is safe from snob-values and pettiness.
—Observer (S.A.).
Employer and Employee
Whenever I read of industrial disputes
I am astonished at the harsh feelings and
lack of co-operation between employer
and employee. The men who work for
us on our farm are not particularly well
paid, but their loyalty is surprising. Dur-
ing busy periods they think nothing of
working 12 hours a day, and the only
time they complain is when some machine
breaks down and holds up important
work. They take a great pride in their
work, and sometimes spend a Saturday
afternoon showing their friends the crops
and stock.
The men on neighboring farms and
stations are the same provided their em-
ployers are reasonable men. It is the
usual thing to hear them refer to “oui;
crops” or “our sheep.” Of course there
is nothing of the boss barking out orders
to these men. They are always consulted
about the job they are doing, and, as a
rule, each man has some section of the
work as his particular care.
Perhaps this spirit is only possible
where the master is in direct contact with
his men. In big organisations the “boss”
becomes more and more impersonal, and
the management tends to regard the men
as machines. — Granova (N.S.W.).
“A.B.C. Weekly”
I’ve always understood that the three
quickest ways of getting rid of money
were, in order, girl friends with expen-
sive tastes, backing racehorses on the
“double-your-losing-bets” system and
starting an unsuccessful newspaper. Since
the staggering losses of the “A.B.C.
Weekly” have been dragged into the light,
however, I’ve changed my opinion about
which should have pride of place as a
money sink.
Twelve hundred pounds lost on every
weekly issue! Thirty-seven thousand
pounds gone down the drain in
seven months! And this in war-
time, too! It’s enough to make the
angels weep and the devil laugh. It’s
accomplished one thing, however; it’s
shown once and for all that radio adver-
tising can be an awful flop. Three times
a day, on the average, the radio announ-
cers have done their best to give the
sales of the publication a boost. —
Tompion (S.A.).
These Interpreters
An advertisement (with photo.) informed
me that a certain well-known “inspiring
broadcasting interpreter” is now editing
a digest magazine. A list of “features” for
the current issue was published. Four
articles from English publications, three
articles from American publications and
two articles from the pen of the inspiring
broadcaster himself. It now only remains
for a Scotsman to bring out a redigest
magazine which will consist of articles
which have already been digested by the
digests.— The Washman (N.S.W.).

Biliousness! Oh, what an awful feeling!
Troubled sleep, dizziness when arising from a sitting
or stooping position, bitter taste in mouth, and a
furred tongue. Bowels may be loose one day, but
constipated the next. This is brought about by the
natural sewers of the body becoming clogged-up, and
the bile, being denied its rightful channel, is turned
into the blood. All or any of these symptoms may
accompany the bilious condition, and while they exist
the patient’s life is scarcely worth living.

the clogged-up System, stir the Liver, cleanse the

SUNBURN
Windburn and Sunburn. —When
the skin is burned by either wind or
sun, or both, one or more liberal
applications of Mirpil will bring
relief. If the skin is too tender to
bear being touched by hand, lay a
clean linen or cotton cloth, saturated
with the Balm, over the affected part.
Mosquitoes and Sandflies.—Mirpil
smeared on face and hands at night
will keep mosquitoes away. It also
soothes mosquito and sandfly bites.
Sore and Tired Feet. —Apply
Mirpil to the soles of your feet when
sore and tired. The relief is won-
derful.
After Shaving. —A small quantity
of Mirpil rubbed on the face after
shaving will be found soothing.
