Speaking of “The Man from Snowy River,”
The Melbourne Arous says:—“There is hope for the
Australian Poet when a volume of verse goes into its
third edition within six weeks of its first, publication, and
great encouragement is to be extracted from the’fact
that the success of the book is entirely justified by the
quality of its contents.”
Mr. J. Br unton Stephens says:— “The more frequently
they are re-read the better they seem to be. I cannot
agree with the critics who say that they are the best
bush ballads since Gordon. I think they are quite on a
level with Gordon's, though, of course, each of the two
writers has his own special merits. . . The bes
book published in Australia for very many years.” 6

Machine Literature.
Time was—and it is not so very long ago
—that an author, when he sat down to write
a book, felt as if he were approaching a
devout task. He felt as if the pen were a
sacred instrument: the book a gospel. He
lived a sane life : that is, he feared God and
slept eight hours every night—and when a
man does those two things he is sane, and
very far removed from pessimism. He
viewed life in a calm and rational manner ;
he went among people enough to understand
them, and he had time and leisure to read.
When he wrote, it was because he felt within
him a mental or spiritual impulse which
drove him to the pen ; and when his work
appeared in print, people realised that the
man had written becanse he had something
to say. He had a message. He wrote from
inspiration. There was in his work a certain
glow, a magnetic vigor, a reaching-out power
which took hold of the reader as it had
possessed the writer.
* * * *
It is this subtle power—or call it by what
name we may—in Thackeray that gave
stamina and strength to “ Vanity Fair,” and
made it a piece of fiction that will live as
long as novels are read. It was that fine
sensation of an inspiration felt and a deed
achieved that Gibbon experienced in his
historical writings. Coming to American
literature, we find the same power behind
almost all of Emerson’s work. Washington
Irving was thus impelled to write, and,
getting even closer in touch with our own
day. we realise the same glow of inspiration
in the writings of Lowell, who never stooped
to make aught but art of literature. Those
were, indeed, pastoral days in literature, and
in America more particularly. The “ needs ”
of the publisher, the “ requirements ” of the
public, were far from the mind of the writer
when he wrote. He was actuated by no
other motive than the impulse which drove
him to transform a mental message—some-
thing which he felt and believed —into printed
pages
1 ° * * * *
Nowadays we have changed all this. In-
spiration is given no chance : one is almost
led to say that it has become an unknown
quality in our literature. The one thought
of the author of to-day is to make matter out
of mind. The successful writer of the pre-
sent, once he has secured the eye of the
public, feels that he must keep himself and
his work before the eye of that public. He
must produce and go on producing whether
impulse or inspiration comes to him or not.
He must, he feels, produce just so much
work. He is sincere and conscientious in the
hope that what he does will be gqod work.
But if it happens to be otherwise, which is
more than likely, he feels that he is not alto-
gether to blame. The work must be pro-
duced. It is not a case of can ; it is simply
and purely one of must. He is in a feverish
race : he needs to keep in the procession
and as near che head of it as he can. He is
driven by a force he neither understands nor
stops to analyse. He must eke out his
living by his pen, and there lies the root of
che evil.
• ♦ * *
Not only does his present belong to
another, but his future is mortgaged. He
contracts to write books for delivery within
the next two, three or five years, quite un-
mindful of the question whether there will
be a book in him to write, or a story in him
to tell, or not. He is simply ‘ ‘ under con-
tract” : his time, his brain, his mind is
mortgaged. For each novel he is offered a
larger sum than he received for his last, and
proud is that author who, when a publisher
comes to him in these days, can say : “ My
dear fellow, 1 can’t undertake another scrap
of work. Everything I do for the next five
years is sold. My 1897 novel goes to So-
and-so, my 1898 stories are sold to ’s
Magazine, while all I do in 1900 I have con-
tracted to give to the ’s. You see how
I am fixed.” And if you ask him what his
1897 novel will consist of, he has no more
idea of its plot or context than has his valet
or cook. Nor is this in any sense an exag-
gerated picture of the condition of the
modern American {or British] author [of
fiction]. With one or two rare exceptions—
so rare that they can be counted upon the
fingers of a single hand, with fingers to
spare —the successful Authors of the day are
under the thraldom of the mod vn literary
king—the almighty dollar.
As things are, a successful author, in our
day, writes just one book—his first book —
with true literary art in it and with the
freshness of inspiration upon it. If this
book does not make a success, he is safe,
and, if not discouraged, he will write
another book of merit. But if his first book
meets with success, he has reached the be-
ginning of the end. Even before he fully
realises that his book has commanded atten-
tion, and that, as an author, he is a success,
he is pounced upon by an army of publishers,
editors, and literary purveyors, who imme-
diately proceed to knock all the inspiration
out of him. His first book was written in
practically an untrammelled spirit, save, of
course, with the pardonable hope of fame
and success. His second book is written
“to an audience ” at “so much per word,”
with the final crack of the whip at the end of
the contract that it will be finished at a cer-
tain date. And yet some of us wonder why
it is that we have so many of what we choose
to call “ one-book authors ” —men and women
who write one successful book and seem to
be incapable of “doing it again,” as we
term it. Is the reason so invisible ?—E. W.
Bok, in Nov. Forum.

Some time ago it was announced that Mr.
H. Spielmann had “undertaken ’’—appro-
priate word!—a “history of Punch.” Its
funeral was yesterday. Britain still keeps
up the fiction that Punch is humorous, and
Mr. Spielmann gives the statistics of its
“ humor.”
Punch consisted in the summer of 1895 of 108
volumes. At the moderate rate of 4 jokes per
column, attempted and made, we reach a grand
total of nearly 270,000 jokes.
270,000 Punch jokes ! No wonder people
talk about the Wcltschmerz.
William Watson’s new book of poems does
not justify the gush of his “barracker,” the
Spectator, but it certainly heightens his
poetical reputation. It contains some ex-
tremely fine verse—always lacking, how-
ever, that touch of inspiration which the
most patient art is unable to compass. The
epithet “ stately ” is rightly applied to lines
like these—and so few can handle the measure
nowadays :—
Be it enough to say, that in Man’s life
Is room for great emotions unbegot
Of dalliance and embracement, unbegot
Ev’n of the purer nuptials of the soul ;
And one not pale of blood, to human touch
Not tardily responsive, yet may know
A deeper transport and a mightier thrill
Than comes of commerce with mortality,
When, rapt from all relation with his kind,
All temporal and immediate circumstance,
In silence, in the visionary mood
That, flashing light on the dark deep, perceives
Order beyond this coil and errancy,
Isled from the fretful hour he stands alone
And hears the eternal movement, and beholds
Above him and around and at his feet,
In million-billowed consentaneousness,
The flowing, flowing, flowing of the world.
Such moments, are they not the peaks of life ?
Enough for me, if on these pages fall.
The shadow of the summits, and an air
Not dim from human hearth-firessometimesblow.
And one cannot resist the pleasure of re-
quoting the Spectator’s extract from “ The
Father of the Forest,” in which Mr. Watson
makes a mighty tree the critic of the human
drama. Here are the closing lines : —
Now from these veins the strength of old,
The warmth and lust of life depart;
Full of mortality behold
The cavern that was once my heart ! ,
Me, with blind arm, in season due,
Let the aerial woodman hew.
For not though mightiest mortals fall,
The starry chariot hangs delayed. t
His axle is uncooled, nor shall
The thunder of His wheels be stayed.
A changeless pace His coursers keep,
And halt not at the wells of sleep.
The South shall bless, the East shall blight,
The red rose of the Dawn shall blow ;
The million-lilied stream of Night,
Wide in ethereal meadows flow ;
And Autumn mourn ; and everything
Dance to the wild pipe of the Spring.
With oceans heedless round her feet,
And the indifferent heavens above,
Earth shall the ancient tale repeat
Of wars and tears, and death and love;
And, wise from all the foolish Past,
Shall peradventure hail at last
The advent of that morn divine
When nations may as forests grow,
Wherein the oak hates not the pine,
Nor beeches wish the cedars woe,
But all in their unlikeness blend
Confederate to one golden end—
Beauty : the Vision whereunto,
In joy, with pantings, from afar,
Through sound and odour, form and hue,
And mind and clay, and worm and star —
Now touching goal, now backward hurled—
Toils the indomitable world.
Sophie Osmond (Melb.) writes fluently and
gracefully enough; and the opening and
closing scenes of her new story, “Snags,”
are not without charm. The story itself has
little interest and no significance.
It is doubtless “Trilby” that has stimu-
lated the publication of a new translation
(4s.) of Henri Miirger’s “ La Vie de
Boheme ” —the archetype and paragon of
romances of student life in Paris. Du
Maurier’s figures are mostly dressed for
effect and an English audience : Miirger’s
wear their own clothes.
“Evolution in Art” (6s. 6d.), the new
volume of the Contemporary Science Series,
is laboriously written by Prof. A. C. Haddon
‘ ‘ to indicate the lines on which Decorative
Art should be studied in order to bring out
its value in the History of Man.” The
author is overwhelmed by his material, and
it is difficult for readers to grapple with
the confused mass of details which he
presents. Much pains and knowledge
go to make his book, but it loses half
its value by not being readable. It is
to be regretted that the Contemporary
Series is losing its popular character. Books
:or specialists we have always had ; dull text-
aooks are plentiful; but brightly-written,
up-to-date treatises like “The Evolution of
Sex” or “ The Criminal”—not too shallow
for the student and not too deep for the tired
brain of the average man—are still needed
and demanded.
Hayes Brothers issue ‘ ‘ The Miners’
Manual ” —an annotated edition, by Cl. C.
Addison, of the N.S. Wales mining regu-
lations and mining board schedules, with
various added information (including a
synopsis of the mining-on-private-lands law).
The pamphlet is useful; though no answer
was found to a couple of test questions —
What are leasehold labor conditions ? Have
leasehold employes to hold miners’ rights 1 —
and so on. Mr. Addison—whose point of
view seems rather legal than mineral—could
have taken a little less for granted without
unduly extending his work.
NOTES.
Writes the late Prof. H. H. Boyesen in
the North American Review :—
One evening when I went with Tourgueneff to a
stag party at the house of a renowned Paris littera-
teur, the conversation turned upon American
humor. Several Frenchmen present, among
others Alphonse Daudet, declared that the
excellence of American humor had been greatly
exaggerated. It seemed to them grotesque rather
than funny.
“There appeared some American stories, a short
time ago, in the Revue des Deux Blondes,” said
Daudet, “they were by Mark Twain; I could
see nothing at all humorous in any of them.”
“ What were they? ” I asked.
“ There was one named ‘ The Jumping Frog,’ ”
he replied, “ a pitiful tale about two men who
made a wager about a frog, one betting that he
could jump to a certain height, the other betting
that he could not: then when the time comes to
test the jumping ability of the frog, it is found
that he has been stuffed full of shot, and, of course,
he cannot jump.”
“ Well,” 1 queried, determined to uphold my
friend, Clemens, “isn’t that rather funny? ”
“No,” replied Daudet decidedly, “I feel too
sorry for the poor frog. ”
Arthur Symons contributes to Pall Mall
Magazine Xmas No. some verses of which
two lines run :—
Flittingly fin-de-siecle and feline at
The hostel guarded by a Sable Cat.
A test of lingual dexterity : speak the
abominable first line “trippingly on the
tongue”?
Cosmos offered a prize for naming the best
12 novels of any modem language. This was
the prize-list (a lady’s) : —Les Miserables
(unaccented), The Three Mosqueteers (?
Mosquitoes), The Last Days of Pompeii,
The-Parisians (can this be Lytton’s “ Paris-
ians” ?), Ben Hur (! ! !), Corinne (pro-
bably she never read Corinne, but it looks
Well), Anna Karenina, Adam Bede, Jane
Eyre, the Old Mam ’Selle’s (sic) Secret
(what on earth is this ?), Henry Esmond,
White Heather (! !). Cosmos deserves thanks
for casting such light on local feminine “cul-
ture.” Incidentally it casts not a little on
its own.
“ The Banjo’s ” poems are now in & fourth
edition. Henry Lawson’s will be ready
this week ; and subscribers’ names (5s.
6d.) are now being received.
“Mr. Nat. Gould’s style,” callously com-
ments the Saturday Review" in the matter
of Australia’s “sporting novelist,” “is the
style of Victor Hugo, his sentiments belong
to the Adelphi, and no words can adequately
express the elementary nature of his story-
telling.”
Adelaide Quiz regrets an ingenious mis-
print : ‘ ‘ By a printer’s error in the review
of Mr. E. Planta Nesbit’s book in last week’s
issue the title was twice given as ‘Jesus an
Essence ’ instead of ‘Jesus an Essene.’ ”
Joseph Conrad, the author of “ Almayer’s
Folly ” —a Bornean tale rather over-praised
by the English press—in his forthcoming
book, “An Outcast of the Islands,” presents
the same characters in an earlier stage of
their existence.
“ Ethel Turner has three new stories ready
for publication.” Surely an enemy hath
said this ?
Printers should write to 87 Ciarence-st.,
Sydney, for Wimble’s Monthly Reminder—
a neat little typographical circular which
would be artistic if it didn’t over-elaborate
ornament.
A new English quarterly magazine, “The
Savoy,” edited by Arthur Symons and Aubrey
Beardsley, was announced for publication
last month. Apparently it is designed to
take in Bohemian hearts the place of the
grown-respectable Yellow Book. Besides
the editors, Bernard Shaw, George Moore,
Havelock Ellis, Max Beerbohm, and other
well-known “modern” writers contribute to
the first number. “We have no formulas,”
says the prospectus, ‘ ‘ and we desire no false
unity of form or matter. We have not in-
vented a new point of view. We are not
Realists, or Romanticists, or Decadents. For
us, all art is good which is good art. We
hope to appeal to the tastes of the intelligent
by not being original for originality’s sake,
or audacious for the sake of advertisement,
or timid for convenience of the elderly-
minded. We intend to print no verse which
has not some close relationship with po -7»
no fiction which has not a certain sense
what is finest in living fact, no cnticisn
which has not some knowledge,, discernment,
and sincerity in its judgment.’
When the elder Dumas stood, in 1848, tor
the Chamber of Deputies, this was his ad-
dress to the electors : —
“I am a candidate for the office of do
puty. I ask your votes. These are my reasons
why you should give them to me. Not
six years devoted to the acquirement of an e -
tion, four years passed in performing the duties
a notary, and seven years as an employe ot the
Government, I have worked ten hours a day to
twenty years. That makes seventy-three thousand
hours. During those twenty years 1 wrote
four hundred volumes ard five hundred plays.
Of each of the four hundred volumes an
average of four thousand copies have been
printed and sold for 5 francs each. 1 he thirty-
five plays have each been performed, on an aver-
age, one hundred times. My books have pro-
duced 11,853,600 francs ; my plays have produced
6,360,600 francs. Taking 3 francs a day as the
average pay of a working-man, and as there are
300 working days in the year, my books have paid
for 20 years the wages of 692 people, and my plays
the wages of 10 years of 347 people ; but the last
figure must be multiplied by 3 to include the pro-
vinces, making 1041, and adding 70 for the ushers,
chiefs of the claque, and cab-drivers, makes a
total of 1458. Plays and books, then, have paid
the wages of 2160 people for all these years not
counting Belgian pirates and foreign translators.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON
CHITJS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat,and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing t hat for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every ot.her
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine f was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continu 'd the treatment, until I he ante,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER
Balmain, S\ dney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along bock of lungs and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
moils. Cough mixtures and poultices were us-d and
plast-rs were applied to the hack and dust without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this m -dicine for about
10 days be was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamwortb, N.S.W.”
‘ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearn s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly a d rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”- Sigtod

Dr. Gibbons
Having: completed his New and Centrallv-situated
Electrical <0 Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome his Friends
and Patients at
137 Elizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. &IBBON9,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, iVc.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufierer to health and happiuess
after having lost all hope.
ONE POUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “ Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires ad vice, and you can either call
and cun salt the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6d. in
stamps, and Dr Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that their cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.
Dr. GIBBONS has documentary evidence of
having thoroughly CURED Thousands of Cases
during the extended time he has practised as a
Specialist in Australia.

LUCKY!
There’s nothin’ licks the diggin’s, an’ you say it
mighty bold,
When your ground is easy drivin’, and you’re
( down upon the gold,
An’ your wash keeps on improvin’, an’ you’ve got
the. bloomin’ creek
A-runnin’ through your boxes for an ounce or two
a week.
There s nothin’ beats the diggin’s when you have a
reefin show,
An’ dollied out your exes from the surface of the
blow;
An sold out to a company, an’ ready cash have
,g°t,
An they blow the bottom out’n her the first or
second shot.
There’s nothin’ licks the diggin’s when, with
} horses ugly-fat,
An’ your wallet fairly heavy with the proceeds
from the flat,
The warden grants exemption, an’ you know
you re goin’ down
To spend your Xmas holidays a-bummin’ round
the town—
You je had your hair cut shorter, an’are rigged in
Sunday togs,
An Polly’s teeth are flashin’ out as white as any
dog’s—
Her ole man smacks your shoulder, an’ it’s easy to
be told
You re “ Ben the lucky digger,” an’ you’re on a
bit of gold.
UNLUCKY!
w h. a t about the diggin’s when you’re
followin’ a streak,
An’ humpin’ down your wash-dirt on your shoulder
to the creek,
An hangin to the color, an’ you bullock week by
week,
An’ know you’re almost on it, and some thunderin’
galoot
Sticks pick into your leader diggin’ out a bandi-
coot.
When alius sinkin’ duffers, alius bottomin’ on
tisb,”
An’ steel from off your pick is all you’re gettin’ in
the dish ?
Yah ! what about the diggin’s when you’re so
completely broke
You live on wild tomatoes, an’ you haven’t got a
smoke,
An can t go when you want to, though you’re
tired out heart an’ soul,
Because you’ve got no tucker, an’ your horse fell
down a hole :
You strike the stores for credit. They’ve all
“ heard that yarn before ”
They ve “ had enough of slopers,” an’ they “ don’t
take any more ! ”
When you’ve to act the Chinaman, a thing you
mortal hate,
An’ cradle out old tailin’s—a long day for half-a-
weight,
Your yarn is slightly altered, an’ yon think you’ll
“give it best
Go down upon the railway—try navvyin’ “fora
rest ”:
An’ you’d “ like a job of wages,” an’ are sure you’d
“stand a boss
“ If there never was a diggin’s ’twould be no such
mighty loss.”
“ There’s nothing beats the diggings! ’’ well,
there’s something in your boast—
There’s thousands that have tried it, and the
diggings beat the most.
Q.

A REFLECTION ON LAWSON’S POEMS.
Seasons bloom and seasons wither; dark or bright,
they cannot last.
Must we try with floods of bitter tears to vivify
the past ?
Vainly chase the- brown and broken blossoms
blown along the blast ?
Shall we scorn the flowers around us—red, or
blue, or white as snow—
Flowers giving loads of fragrance unto all the
winds that blow ?
Must we hide our eyes and falter : “O, the days
of long ago ! ”
Never stop to look behind you, if the blaze of
glory there
Blinds you to the splendour stretching round
about and everywhere.
True, the j)ast was pleasant, Lawson, but the
present is as fair. x
I, too, love the days when heroes, seeking trea-
sure, seaward sped;
Days of Drake, when English sailors followed
where their leaders led;
Days when Marlowe trod the glowing clouds, that
thundered to his tread.
Even then, though, there were cowards, traitors,
swindlers, “business men,”
Plot and murder, slave and master, secret sneer,
and wounding pen ;
And the poets thought the present vile and barren
even then.
And their comrades were no better than some
modern mates we meet —
Even though they don’t go wearing tights and
feathers in the street ;
And the girls are dear as ever, and their kisses
just as sweet.
Sing the present; drop the drivel of the “days
evanished,” please !
Though you pray until your pants are burst or
baggy at the knees,
You can’t bid the sun go backward—no, not even
ten degrees.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 18, 1896.
The Anglo-Jap. Treaty.
There is shortly to be held in Sydney a
conference of representatives from the
various Australian provinces to decide
whether or not they shall become parties to a
certain recent Anglo-Japanese treaty. The
fact that these representatives are going to
discuss the question distinctly implies that
it is one which admits of discussion, and
that there is more or less chance of it being
answered in the affirmative. At all events,
the persons who are going to discuss don’t
regard the Jap. treaty as a self-evident
absurdity—a matter so utterly ridiculous as
to be beyond the range of politics and
possibility ; it is, in their opinion, a thing to
be at least taken seriously. Therefore, this
is the time for the Australian public to
think hard over this proposed convention,
which has hitherto seemed such a far-off,
impersonal affair as to lie beyond the ordinary
person’s horizon, and to know what manner
of thing it is that their rulers are tak-
ing seriously and may possibly assent
to. The fact that the Australian Govern-
ments haven’t cast the Jap. treaty into the
waste-paper basket after one perusal as a
thing too hopelessly ridiculous for consifl'""x-
tion, is at least noteworthy.
* * * *
The treaty consists, to all intents anu x „r-
-poses, of two clauses. One provides that
the Japanese shall have free access to
the British dominions, and the Briton free
access to the Japanese dominions, and that
neither of them shall be subjected by the
other to any tax which it doesn’t impose on
its own subjects. The second provides that
the goods of each country shall come into
the other free of all special duties—they
may pay the same tariff' which is charged on
foreign goods in general, but no more. This
is the treaty which Britain has made with
Japan, and it suits Britain sufficiently well.
That country is separated from Japan by the
whole width of the earth, and is fenced off
from it by two continents. It is too far re-
moved for the. Jap. to be able to pay his
passage there in any large numbers. It
is already overcrowded, and there are no
great waste spaces in which a horde of
foreigners might settle. If even a million
Japanese came there—which is impossible—
they could not very seriously adulterate the
blood of 40,000,000 white inhabitants. In
all probability the British will invade Japan
on a much larger scale than the men of the
Rising Sun will invade Britain. The latter
country is the largest shipowner, merchant
and carrier in the world, therefore—for the
time at least—it will make nwich profit in
freights out of the Japanese connection. It
is also one of the greatest manufacturers
in the world, and by getting a lien on
Japan it will secure a decided start of some
of its industrial rivals. Altogether, the
treaty is good enough for Britain at present,
whatever it may prove later on.
* * * *
Australasia is offered the privilege of
coming into the treaty on the same terms as
Britain, and the local politicians propose to
seriously consider whether they should do so
or not. This is an astonishing sample of
official ineptitude. Australia has nothing to
gain, and its whole future, its prosperity, its
rank as a white nation, and its soul—if it
possesses one—to lose by walking into the
Japanese treaty. What Japan wants, first of
all, is an outlet for its overcrowded popula-
tion, and Australia is the nearest land which
lias much space to spare, and where the
Jap. could go in safety. Therefore, if he
was guaranteed security, a great, rich and
comparatively new country to exploit, no
poll-tax disabilities, no special repressive
Customs duties, and absolute freedom to
come by thousands and by millions, he would
come in all probability as long as there was
room in Australia for the Japanese overflow.
Out of the 41,000,000 of its brown inhabi-
tants, Japan could spare enough to make
Australia, in a comparatively few years,
quite as much Asiatic as European. More-
over, it is not only the overflow which has to
be reckoned with, for the Jap., unlike the
average Chinaman, brings with him his wife
and his female belongings, and multiplies in
the land—and he stays there. He is the
most apt and ingenious workman in Asia,
and one of the most ingenious in the world.
There is probably nothing which the Aus-
tralian can do which he can’t do, and there
are few things which the Australian can
do well which he can’t do at least as
well. Also, he knows many arts of which
the Australian is wholly ignorant. He is
fully as progressive as the Australian and
possibly more energetic. Within the last
ten years his manufactures have increased
about six times as fast as those of this
country. He has a State paper currency,
national bank, 270 private banks, savings-
banks, a post-office which is so much better
managed than those of Australia that it
makes a large annual profit, telegraphs, tele-
phones, sub-marine cables, State railways—
which also yield a profit, a large mercantile
navy, compulsory education, universities,
public libraries, a tolerably reliable surplus,
a public debt which is being steadily
paid off out of revenue, and an army
and navy which—judged by their num-
bers and their recent exploits—should be
fully equal to any purely Australian force
that could be made available—and possibly
much more than equal. A nation like tills
is quite capable of taking serious steps to
make Australia adhere to the letter and the
spirit of any treaty it may enter into ; there-
fore, if Australia agrees, as suggested, that
the Jap. shall have free access to this
country, whether he comes by thousands or
by millions, it will probably have to take the
consequences, whatever they may be. And
they may amount in course of time to
nothing less than the transformation of this
country into a semi-Asiatic state ruled, to a
great extent at least, by an Asiatic majority.
* * * *
The Japanese is not only clever, indus-
trious, and enterprising ; he is also cheap.
He can do the work of the Australian agri-
culturist, artisan, miner, shop-keeper, &c.,
&c., at half, or, if necessary, less than half,
Australian rates. Therefore, the Australian
can sit down and seriously' consider what
chance he would have in competition with
these busy, brown men of the North, who
outnumber him more than ten to one. Also,
the Jap. is not content, like most other
Asiatics, to be a mere hewer of wood and
drawer of water. He has already gained a
footing at Thursday Island, in North Queens-
land, and there he has promptly elbowed
out the white storekeepers, merchants
and shipbuilders, and annexed all these
industries almost bodily. He is now busy
doing the same elsewhere. He has ambitions
to invade the banking, importing, legal,
medical, and all other lines of business,
including the military profession and politics.
Under the proposed treaty he will have the
same right of naturalisation as any other
alien, and he will probably use it to become
a power in the State. The only apparently
redeeming feature in this fatal convention is
that, though the Australian cannot shut out
the Jap. no matter what his numbers may
be, or poll-tax him, or put him under any
other disabilities whatever, it may tax im-
ported Japanese goods at the same rate as
those of any other nation—but not at any
higher rate. But as it can do this in any
case, and always has done it, this isn’t a con-
cession. Moreover, the Jap. can, and does,
tax Australian goods in return, and will con-
tinue to do so if he pleases, so there is no
concession on his side either.
The one inducement held out to Australia
is that Japan may prove a suitable market
for this country’s meat and wool. If the
Jap. can be persuaded to eat meat, which he
doesn’t to any great extent at present, and
to wear wool, which may or may not be the
case, and he doesn’t proceed to grow these
articles for himself, and he can’t get them
at a cheaper rate anywhere else, and he
can be induced to remove the duties
from them, then there will be a more
or less uncertain market for these articles
in Japan. But he isn’t at all likely to
remove the duties on Australian imports
unless Australia, in return, removes its
duties on Japanese goods, so there is nothing
to be gained in this respect by the treaty
which couldn’t be gained quite as well in
other ways. The bargain which Australia is
invited to enter into may be divided into
three heads: (1) The Jap. is to have free access
to Australia and the Australian free access
to Japan, which privilege the latter already
possesses, and finds of no value. The Jap.
will come to A ustralia in immense numbers,
because he has a great surplus population,
and Australia offers him better wages,
abundant spare room, and a field for estab-
lishing many manufacturing industries at
present almost unknown over most of this
country. The Australian won’t go to Japan
because he has no surplus population ; there
is no room for him in the crowded land of
the Rising Sun ; wages are too low for him
to live upon ; and the Jap. can do almost
every kind of work that he knows and some
others besides, so that there is no possible
demand for him. (2) The Japanese will
admit Australian goods at the regular tariff
rate, and Australia will do likewise. They
both do this already, and Japan has had
much the best of the deal, - so there is
nothing to be gained. (3) The Japanese
may admit Australian wool and meat free if
this country makes similar concessions in
return, but it is quite certain that Japan
won’t grant any concession without getting
full value in return, and it is folly to admit
the Jap. to eat up this country for the sake
of a wool-and meat concession which will
have to be paid for separately in addition.
* * * *
If any of the Australias do give in
their adhesion to this famous treaty it
will only be through the apathy of their
people. The great mass of the population is
apt not to appreciate a new danger simply
because it is new ; the threatened evil
never happened before, which, to the
aggregate intellect, is a good reason for
believing it never will happen. But
history is full of impossible things which
came to pass when they were least expected ;
and the swamping of Australia by an Asiatic
race may be one of them. Thirty years ago
the idea that Japan would be a great world-
power to be seriously feared and reckoned
with in Europe seemed as ludicrous as does
now the idea that a Japanese majority may
dominate Australia thirty years hence ; yet
one event has arrived, and the other may,
unless this country • takes thought for
the future. Any province which accepts
the proposed treaty gives itself away for
absolutely nothing to the most enterprising
race to be found outside Europe and North
America ; also, it deliberately goes out of its
way to make indefinite complications for the
future, and it, creates another serious obstacle
in the way of Australian unity. The Fat
Man and the Lean should be unanimous in
this matter, for their interests are equally
involved. The Japanese as a cheap worker
would oust the white laborer first, but that
would be only the beginning of the trouble
He would begin to oust the Fat Man by-and-
bye, for he is of a wholly different stamp
from the Coolie and the Kanaka and the
Chinaman, and wherever he takes root he
fully intends to be his own Fat Man in good
time. Experience shows, too, that he
generally “gets there.” There is no possible
reason to suppose that Japan seeks any
quarrel with Australia, but if this country
puts itself in such a position that, a few years
hence, it will have to seek a quarrel with
Japan in order to get rid of an unendurable
obligation, then the consequences will be its
own affair.
The Australian Turf.
Patriots who have cavilled at The Bulletin’s
views of Australian jockeyship and racing
“sport” in general had better swallow this
bit of comment from Melb. Argus. It is
apropos to the V.R.C. Handicap at last Flem-
ington Bpring meeting :
Theie is no doubt that Bnrrabari was in the race men-
tioned very unfairly treated, and within the last few
weeks there have been several cases in which well-backed
horses have been dealt with by the riders of other horses •
which there is every reason to believe were simply started
with the view of interfering with the ones carrying money
In Sydney this question of foul riding is ev en more serious
and the stewards will sooner or later have to take very
stringent measures to suppress it. Jockeys themselves
through a mistaken idea of loyalty to each other are
always reluctant to make a complaint, and this constitutes
the real difficulty in getting- at the offenders. A well-
known owner, who was winning important races as far
back as the early seventies, remarked to me yesterday
that never in the whole of his racing experience has fotil
riding been so prevalent as at present. In the old raciiv
days, he asserted, an owner could back his horse with
every confidence that he would receive fair play in the
race; now, if he put anything like a decent sum on he
found that his horse was bumped and knocked about and
often galloped on right from the barrier rise. The postins?
of stewards at different parts of the course might 'have
the effect oi checking to some extent the unfair and
highly dangerous tactics alluded to.
The Bulletin, a while ago, somewhat hurt the
feelings of Young Australia by suggesting that
Hinglish “ turf-men ” would deny the name of
sport to rough-and-tumble racing as conducted
nowadays on Australian circular courses. And
now we have the daily sup-Press goino so far
as to quote local expert opinion in support of
this shameful journal’s nasty remarks.
* * * *
Turf ••form” in this country is a painful
subject for discussion, apart from the foul-play
element. The practice of racing fat horses into
condition at petty suburban meetings is held
guiltless- “Roping,” if notactually applauded,
is allowed to pass with a cynical remark.
Trainers are worse than cunning, they ar ■
thickheaded likewise. It frequently happens
that horses, after being run when obviously
short of work, and “roped when really fit,
go for the coin when they are stale and can t
show their “ form.” On top of all these various
chances against the punter who knows some-
thing, or knows nothing, we have the ugly fact
that, when a fit horse is running on its merits,
some of the stiff ’uns are being employed to
bust up the animal’s show.
* * *
The Australian Turf is cursed with a lack of
the cash necessary to keep an expensive amuse-
ment going in a fairly decent way. \ ery few
owners are wealthy, therefore trainers are men
of straw, and jockey-bovs, who ought to get a
steady financial encouragement to go straight,
become the hard-faced accomplices of needy
tricksters, and instruments of Ikey Mo. In
England capable trainers and clever riders can,
and do, amass large fortunes on a reputation
for honesty. There is a good market for
brains and skill cum fair dealing. A Duke
of Westminster, or Portland, may be a petty-
minded, contemptible person in many respects,
but circumstances over which he has no con-
trol preserve him from temptation to lurf
malpractices. The bloated capitalist is a
producer of high-class trainers and jockeys.
He demands consistency in the running of his
horses, and, as far as equine nature will permit,
he gets what he pays handsomely for. If Lord
Rosebery possesses a really good Derby favorite
it behaves as such in public. It comes to the
post with a polish on it, is ridden by an artist,
and doesn’t get “messed about” during the
race. Sometimes, of course, a rich owner is a
rogue by choice, but if he has connected himself
with a reputable stable he must play his hanky-
panky tricks “ on his own.”
The late Mr. Fred. Gretton, partner in
Bass’s beer business, was a case in point. He
bought fine horseflesh and placed his racing-stud
under the care of John Porter, the Duke of
Westminster’s trainer. Gretton would order
his “ cracks” to be prepared for big handicaps,
and at the last moment, when public money
had made them favorites, he would scratch
them. Porter expostulated. The beery
owner asserted his “ perfect right to do what
he liked with his own.” Whereupon the trainer
replied that he hadn’t sold his own respectable
name to any employer, and would no longer
Aeep the much-scratched racers on his pre-
mises. “ Clear them out within 48 hours,”
said John Porter, and Gretton’s stud was
removed to the establishment of a trainer
notoriously less scrupulous than most other big
men in his profession. This was the cronk old
Duchess of Montrose’s stable. Charles Wood
was her jockey for several years, and Wood
was the only “great” jockey who has been
wiped off the face of the turf by the jock"v-
club stewards within the last thirty years

The most reputable of English racing statm-s
are the schools where promising light weights
get their education. The boys grow' up in the
habit of doing their best to win. The reward
of success in the saddle is an early banking
account, and the certain prospect of a large
legitimate income hereafter, when the lad
shall have completed his apprenticeship and
become able to take fat retaining fees, and pick
likely mounts in all directions—as long as he
retains his reputation for straight going. Suc-
cessful jockeys are important creatures, with
important trainers and influential owners at
the back of them. Mornington Cannon—
named after a horse that his faluer trained and
rode to victory in days of yore—has more than
200 winning mounts per annum. Hi* mount
isn’t trampled on from behind, or blocked, or
deliberately bumped against the rails. The
“ toffs ” of the profession are examples to the
boys of what honest riding can accomplish in
the financial way, and no boy with the possi-
bility of a similar career before him, would
care to ride foul even if he could depend on
being able to do it with impunity —as in Aus-
tralia. Besides, they are not ruling stiff ’uns
for impecunious cut-throat stables. Stewards
have no occasion to look for cases of foul riding.
It couldn t come into vogue under the present
conditions of the English turf. There is too
much cash about. Money is the root of much
evil, and, at the same time, the only possible
guarantee of decency in gambling sport.
* * * *
The Australasian lurf is probably the rot-
tenest sporting institution in the world—there
are so few rich employers of trainers and
jockeys, and so many needy ones tryin« f to
“ make a bit” anyhow. Roguery brings no°dis-
lionor upon our professional turfmen, because
the inducement to honesty is not strong. Down-
right rascality is the natural development of
unchecked roguery, and we’ve got it bad.
Listen again, ye fatuous punters, to the quite
casual remark of a representative daily journal:
The posting of stewards at different parts of the course
mujht have the effect of checkin,, tosome extent thl
unfair and highly-dangerous tactics alluded to.
This same journal expressed surprise at the
absence of Aurana s name from the A mt.rai.ian
Cup entries. Why surprise? Auraria is a
good mare, with a consistent record. She has
form. She would be freely backed for any-
thing oil her merits. Therefore, the proud
owner bemg merciful to his beast, and not uu-
Anra!i l ? ih v , aluable P ro P ert y> doesn’t expose
Auraria to the handicap risk of being wilfully
bumped and knocked about,” and “ galloped
oil right from the barrier rise.” 1
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Notice to Litigants.
? LD ’ « U i l ] , ,T C r OMlmon P lace John Vanhjsidev of
Lanceheld (Vic.), farmer, aged 66, who suicided
all over should remembered
all ovei Australia as a warning to people who
fc>ue other people for damages. Vanheiden li .d
a just cause of complaint against the local Shire
and 7 lth the usual silll P le faith in the
damages'" ? f , § rievanc es he sued for
was lone and J ’ lke j lOSb ° ther civil cases .
three seLrafe tlfV VC % slovv > *>ut afte
separate trials he was finally awarded


£2OO and costs. \ anheiden, like the average
lay ignoramus, thought a verdict of £2OO and
costs meant that he got all his law expenses
and was,£2oo to the good, and, like everybody
else who goes to law, lie presently found his
mistake. His solicitor sent in his hill for three
expensive trials ; it was taxed by the prothono-
Lary in the usual course, and the Shire Council
paid the taxed bill. The amount disallowed
by the prothonotary had to be paid by Van-
jieiden himself, and it absorbed the £2OO
damages and the old man’s farm as well, and
left him penniless. It cost him, roughly
speaking, £SOO to win his £2OO case, and
it cost the Council a good deal more to
lose it. The ancient farmer could never
fully understand why he was ruined by getting
£2OO damages, and he took to uttering crazy
threats against the other side, and then he was
run in and committed for trial for intimidation,
but the Crown, in a sympathetic moment,
allowed the case to drop. Then old Vanheiden,
left in ilia declining years without a single asset
save his vague sense of complaint against all the
world, tried to recover damages from the magis-
trates who committed him, but, having no
money to go on with the case, it fell through,
and so he blew out with a gun whatever intellect
the law had left him and took his troubles
to another sphere. His end is a solemn caution
to all litigants ; in 99 eases out of 100, the only
person who wins anything in a civil action is
that indefinite individual called “ costs,”
and if there have been successful litigants
who had anything left out of a verdict after
paying their share of the costs, this paper
has never heard of them. The Australian
is proud of the purity of justice in this country,
and, taking one thing with another, it is rather
better than the world’s average —but it would
be more profitable for most people if it were
worse. An unjust Judge who took a £IOO
bribe in a small case and gave his decision
accordingly without worrying about evidence
would be a great deal cheaper than a just sys-
tem which ruins both parties. The unjust
system, at its worst, seldom ruins more than
one party at a time. Also, it would probably
strike the truth about as often, for half the
expense of Australian civil law is arrived at by
carrying cases from one court to another, and
each one upsetting the verdict of the one before
it, until everything is upset—except costs.
More N.S.W. Protection.
The Bulletin respectfully appeals, for the
severalth time or more, to Premier Reid of
New South VVales, to give up the hollow
mockery of professing to be a Freetrader, seeing
that he can’t live up to his creed, and to cease
the hypocrisy of preaching a faith which he
dare not practise, and to go straight, if such a
thing be possible. G. H. Reid’s latest falling
away to Protection took place the other day.
A large and costly deviation is to be made on
the Western railway, and the Government has
decided that it is to be done by day instead of
contract labor ; that the workers are to get (is.
a day ; that N.S.W. men are to have the pre-
ference, and a further preference is to be given
to the unemployed now engaged in the Cen-
tennial Park sand-shifting job. The Bulletin,
as a Protectionist journal, cordially approves
of this, in the main, but for Premier Reid, as a
Freetrader, to do such things is an outrage.
The essence of the creed which the country
pays him a very high salary to support is
that the community at large should not
be taxed in order to bolster up any single
industry or any set of persons, and,
under such circumstances, Premier Reid
has no right to pay 6s. a day for work
that he could get done at a much cheaper
rate. Also, he has no right to employ the
starved and weakened unemployed when he
could get far stronger and more expert men
without paying any more for them ; and there
is no earthly justice, according to G. Reid’s
faitlr, iu giving a preference to the local in-
habitant, seeing that he was put in office ex-
pressly to undo the work of the Dibbs Govern-
ment which gave the local man justsuch a prefer-
ence, and which was howled down by Reid for
doing it. The creed on which Premier Reid
was sent into office was that tire cornstalk was
to compeie against the Chow and Jap. and
nigger ami the imported “ Dago,” and every
other foreigner with no State assistance what-’
ever, and it he won’t live up to iris creed then
he is holding office and drawing Iris salary under
false pretences. The advantage which he pro-
mised from tlris free competition was the
cheapening of all necessaries and the lift-
ing of a burden of taxation from “ the
shoulders of the working man,” and by going
back on his creed, and not employing
the cheapest labor which free competition can
supply, he deliberately piles a needless burden
of £25,000 or so on the said “ shoulders.” The
Bulletin is still waiting to find one Freetrader
who has the honesty to act up to his heartless
doctrine, and it doesn’t see any signsof him. And,
meanwhile, it badly wants to know wiry those
of the Sydney unemployed who voted for the
Freetrade party at last election accept these
favors from Mr. Reid, seeing that they helped
to put that gentleman into office on a creed
whose first axioms are that every man is to get
his market-value, and his market-value is to be
fixed by free competition with all the cheap
races of the earth, and that the subsidising of
anybody at the expense of the community is
very wrong indeed. And it further wants to
know why the big majority which so lately
voted for Freetrade doesn’t insist on having it,
and shut down on this Protectionist outrage ?
George Rex.
Act 11., George 11., ch. 19, figured once more
in Redfern (Sydney) police-court on 9th inst.,
and one Michael Dynon went summarily under
for £39 or six months’ goal. This is the old
disLraiut-for-rent oppression, with the sinewy
tentacles which grab the man moving his
furniture before paying up. More times than
an average Australian has hairs on his head
has N.S.W. Parliament tried to kill Act 11.,
George 11., eh. 19, but ghosts enough of dead
old English landocrats enter into callow and
baldheaded representatives of here and there
to make such attempts futile and keep the
wcarv oppression going. It is fair to admit
that advocates for the abolition of distraint-
for-rent have often made a mess of their sub-
ject, and thereby given the enemy room to
scoff and pretexts for sticking to George, but
even in the worst efforts there was quite enough
argument to have made any but a tradition-
ridden and property-souled Legislature pause
in its course. George Rex in New South
Wales works to-day iniquitously in many
ways. For instance, landlord and tenant may
befriends. In this case'the tenant victimises
butcher, baker, grocer, and all who trust him
as far as they will let him, and when they sue
the landlord distrains. “ All I want,” the
friendly landlord says, “ is that you now pay
me weekly; what you owe me is covered by
your furniture, and that may stand till some-
one interferes.” On the other hand, the
landlord may not be “ friendly,” and then
the tenant who gets behindhand, and
who calculates that a little time will set
him right with his several creditors, is worried
by his knowledge of his landlord’s power.
Every day, between sunrise and sunset, George
Rex enables that landlord to invade the
tenant’s premises, sell up all his visible assets,
and pocket the entire proceeds. If baker,
butcher, and other creditors shared in the pro-
ceeds the transaction might be rough, but
would be at any rate impartial, but George
Rex, grandly indifferent to everybody but the
landlord, puts the whole takings into that
individual’s pocket. Further, if a tenant
endeavors to dodge this travesty on equity by
removing his assets to a place where all
creditors may attack him with equal chance,
George Rex comes down on him with a £2
fine for every pound’s worth of goods removed,
or, as an alternative, a long spell of
gaol punishment. This latter is what
befell Michael Dynon, of Redfern. Of course,
the position of the landlord is not precisely the
same as that of the grocer. The grocer can stop
supplies as soon as he distrusts, while the land-
lord who comes to distrust must go through a
form of ejectment which costs time and money.
There are, however, ways of meeting this and
other difficulties, and the public complaintis that
instead of considering these and giving them
legal shape, Parliament after Parliament re-
enth rones ancient, inequitable, oppressive
George Rex, thus playing into the hands of
tricky landlords and tricky tenants, over-
whelming tenants who are temporarily embar-
rassed, and, in effect, barefacedly robbing all
and sundry of the tradesmen who trusted the
tenant’s word.
The Pastoral Sweater.
The Australian Eat Man shows at his very
best in the mallee districts of Victoria. Pre-
vious Vic. Governments leased out the mallee
in huge areas, at rents which went down as low
as one-twentieth of a penny per acre. The Fat
Man tenant was allowed to sub-let or to sell his
rights, and, owing to the increasing scarcity of
good agricultural land, he was able to cut
up and dispose of great areas, at something
often not very much below freehold prices.
The Government, he pointed out, must give
the small agriculturist his freehold by-and-
bye, because it would never dare to face the,
odium of evicting something like 4000 families,
and confiscating £2,000,000 of their money,
and the farmer took this view and acted
accordingly. Now the Government finds itself
confronted by a strange and complicated state of
things. It has received no payment for about
1,500,000 acres of land which the farmer has
bought from men who had only a leasehold
right to sell. Its duty lo the country at large
requires that these settlers should either pay
for their land or be fired out, but it takes a
strong Government with a very big majority to
do so wholesale an ejection. It would be an
ejection iu most cases, for the mallee farmer,
when he borrowed money for improvement
purposes, had to pay often 15 or 20 per cent,
for it because he had no freehold security to
give, and the interest on his mortgages have
eateu him up. If the Government takes a cash
view of the situation and evicts these ignorant
and deluded purchasers, it will add enormously
to the aggregate poverty of the country, and
the evil is so large that the total loss might be
almost as much as the gain. There is no
statute that can reach Fat Man for selling his
one-twentieth-of-a-penny per annum leasehold,
for he made no false representations
“ within the meaning of the Act ” ; and
when he sold the land at nearly freehold
rates, and then charged 15 or 20 per cent,
for advances on it, he did nothing, which en-
ables the law, in its present state, to turn him
upside-down and shake the ill-gotten coin out
of him. Altogether, the mallee problem is one
of the ugliest of the many problems that the
Turner Government took over from its shift-
less predecessors, and it looks almost incapable
of solution. One way to prevent such troubles
in the future, however, is to wholly prohibit
the sub-letting of Government leaseholds under
pain of heavy fine and forfeiture. The sub-
letting or selling of leaseholds at a big advance
on the price paid to the State by the original
holder is quite as bad a form of sweating as the
sub-letting of Government contracts, and the
Government which shuts down on the latter
iniquity can’t let the former one pass, unless it
has only courage enough to assert itself against
the smaller and less aggressive variety of Eat
Man.
Germans in London.
Only commercial Britishers, and chiefly the
English section at that, can realise the depth
of last week’s anti-German demonstrations in
London. To the free-living cockney ware-
houseman and clerk, not forgetting the goods
porter, all Germans are blanky. The adjective
—which, of course, is subject to alteration, like
a variety - show programme—was connected
with the proper noun by a hyphen some time
previous to the Franco-German war. It is
applied with much emphasis. The blanky-
Geriuan in London, or any other big British
trading town, is offensive to the native-born for
many reasons. He has lowered the price of
mercantile labor, and lengthened “ city ” hours
by his awful industry and readiness to slave for
a bare pittance. He is better educated and
more methodical than the men whose country he
is flooding with cheap goods. He loves work at
the office as the Englishman loves ease and home.
His pleasures are few and economical, whereas
the true cockney delights in nothing that
doesn’t cost money. The blanky German is
the thriftiest of wooers. The average young
Englishman “ blews ” half his capital every
time he takes his girl out for a day, and per-
haps makes a reckless attempt to recover it by
putting the balance on a horse. Differing
widely in their habits and ideas of happiness,
they are, nevertheless, so much alike in phy-
sical temperament that neither fellow interests
the other. The cockney is seriously frivolous,
the German depressiugly humorless. Nature
doesn’t allow them to enjoy one another’s
society, and so the local islander learns to hate
the interloping stranger who is making it more
a nd more difficult to earn one’s living comfortably.
Rivalry alone, however, would not breed the ugly
sentiment that exists. The London German, in
many oases, renders himself hateful with a bad
imitation of English manner and bearing. He
overacts the character. Flinging aside his bit
of continental politeness, which was a very
little bit anyhow, he becomes in public the most
arrogant and insolent of pushing individuals—
a blanky German, indeed. See him enter a
railway-carriage. He makes a point of imme-
diately banging the nearest window up or
down, according to whether it was down or up
when he arrived. He sticks his boots on the
opposite seat, opens bis newspaper with a
savage flourish, and snorts aggressively in token
of his independence. John Bull is a gracious
fellow compared with him. The writer, looking
back at many German residents of Iris native
London through the mists of a dozen Austra-
lian years, felt his heart throb at the mention
of anti German demonstrations. All the old
antipathy to those strong, coarse caricatures of
Britons returned with a rush. Confound ’em !
Heave bricks through their club windows, for
any gentler reminder of their unpopularity
would be wasted on such thick - skinned
grunters. Refuse further admission to any-
thing made in Germany, except music, and join
hands across the Channel with the Teutons’
natural enemy, France. Also, sing the great
Jingo song and get gloriously drunk.
Some More of the Anglo-Jap. Treaty.
One or two items from a Sydney Daily Tele-
graph interview with the Japanese Consul :
Japan, let me tell you, has her eyes open to the mutual
advantages of any treaty, and it would be a great misfor-
tune if Australia did not join in the Japanese treaty for
the sake of her wool, hides, and numerous other items
now exported to Japan. If Australia declined to take
advantage of any treaty, possibly the Japanese Government
might turn nasty, and it would be a great pity if they
imposed a 20 per cent, duty on Australian wool, hides, etc.
The Japanese people are willing to trade, but if Australia
declines their reciprocity proposals, they will simply
retaliate by erecting a wall of tariffs against Australian
exports. They know they can buy wool from Argentina
as advantageously as from Australia, distance making
no difference in the matter. Japan is becoming a
mighty nation, which we do not properly realise in Aus-
tralia. Her people feel it, and they are not to be played
with any more. Just think what possibilities she offers
for a market in Australian wool, with 40 millions of people
to clothe, and all requiring woollen clothing in the winter.
The importation of wool is increasing largely every year.
This sounds very large and gorgeous, and
therefore it is worth while looking at the cash
aspect of this immense and much-increasing
Japanese trade. New South Wales has most
of it, and New South Wales’s exports to Japan
amounted in 1894 to just £15,302, out of a total
export of £20,510,000. Japan has been practi-.
cally a Freetrade country, charging only 5 per
cent, duty on Australian wool, yet this mangy
result is all the boasted export trade amounts to.
In 1891 the exportswere £13,000, so the inurease
in three years has been just £2OOO. The
imports from Japan are worth £27,408, and the
two together make up a wretched little total
which is hardly worth considei ation. More-
over, the Australian is hereby invited to con-
sider the fact that the Japanese reciprocity is
altogether one-sided. Japan is in the main a
silver-coinage land, and its coinage is depre-
ciated in foreign markets like silver in general.
Australia is a gold country. When the
Australian sends £1 worth of goods to
Japan the native must pay fully 30s.
(nominal value) of his silver for them ; if
the Jap. sends £1 worth of goods to Australia,
and is paid in gold, that sovereign will buy
fully 30s. of his native silver coinage. There-
fore, the mere difference in silver and gold
values means a duty of fully'so per cent, levied
on imports from Australia, and a bonus of 50
per cent, paid on Japanese exports to Australia.
Under these circumstances it is mere drivel to
talk of Freetrade between Australia and Japan j
the trade will be free in Australia and loaded with
almost prohibitive duties in Japan, whatever the
tariff says to the contrary. And, even if there
could be Freetrade between the two countries,
the proposal to open the gates of all Australia,
and pledge ourselves to keep them open, for
the sake of preserving a commerce that totals—
exports and imports together—£42,ooo a year
in New South YVales, and about as much for all
the rest of Australia, is ludicrous. If the net
profit on New South Wales’s share of the trade
amount to £2OOO a year, which isn’t likely, the
value of it is four-fifths of a halfpenny per in-
habitant yearly. The individual who proposes
to hand his country over to an Asiatic race to
conserve four-fifths of a halfpenny per annum
is the cheapest J. Iscariot on record.
The S.M. Herald adversely criticises the
efforts of Chief-Justice Griffith in the matter
of the projected Queensland University.
Griffith’s enthusiasm for the new foundation
is represented as an exhibition of non-federal,
if not anti-federal, sentiment. The Herald
means that, whereas Sydney possesses a well-
equipped and highly-successful University,
Queensland should, if her federal spirit were
strong, gravitate to this central institution in-
stead of setting up an establishment for herself.
Such criticism is vain, to a melancholy degree.
As many states as Australia shall have, so
many Universities should it have, or more
if necessary. Every State of the Ameri-
can Union has its University, and without
any infraction of the federal unanimity. When,
however, Australia is federated, it is to
be hoped that a really federal University will
be founded, distinct from the N.S. W. one, the
Victorian one, the Queensland one, and all
others, whose functions will be, like the
London University, to examine and grant
degrees to all comers, wherever educated and
however trained.
The bitter opposition - threatened to the pro-
posed Parkes parliamentary grant derives
most of its best arguments from the N.S W.
ex-Premier’s own opposition to the John
Robertson parliamentary grant. At that time
the “ maker of Australian history ” proved to.,
the satisfaction of many that there exists no'
power under the Constitution whereby a
majority of members may vote public money to
one of their fellows, and he instanced with
enthusiastic approval how that competent par-
liamentarian, Charles Cowper, when his.
Premiersliips were over, declined a gift from
the House and trusted to the magnum
mity of the public he had served. Parkks,
however, having tapped the public, like Coweek,
now buttonholes Parliament, like Robertson,
and necessarily makes himself a target.
Premier Reid gave to the deputation which
asked, at the last moment, for the life of
Bheridan a learned and doubtless accurate
definition of the New South Wales law of ;
murder, ami the twelve jurymen who found
Sheridan guilty are hereby invited to seriously
consider the same. According to that defini-
tion, any wilful and reckless act of omission
which results in the loss of a human life is
murder. The jurymen, according to the state-
ment of their foreman, more or less endorsed by.
eight or nine of their number, didn’t consider
Sheridan deserving of death. They had, as
the Judge carefully informed them, power to
bring in a verdict of manslaughter only, and
thereby save him from the extreme penalty of
the law, and they held that Sheridan should '
have been saved from the extreme penalty.
Yet they wilfully and recklessly omitted to
take this course, and thereby caused the sacri-
fice of a life which they held should not have
been sacrificed. They committed this act with
no shadow of excuse save that they-trusted the
Executive not to act on their verdict, and
reckoned that “it made no difference.” How
does Premier Reid’s definition of murder tit the
case of that unspeakable jury ? And was
Sheridan, the hanged criminal, one whit more
reckless about human life tliah the majority of
the jury were on their own showing ?
President Kruger and his sanctimonious fol-
lowers of the Transvaal have, after all, treated
the Rand gold-miners and hangers-on hardly any
worse than successive N.S. Wales Govts, treated
Broken Hill. Kruger regards the
much as G. R. Dibbs once hinted that he re- 1
garded the Broken Hill owners. “ What do
you care about New South Wales?” G.R.D. .
demanded of a B.H. director. “ All you care:
about is tearing - the guts out of the place.”.
And the gentle Premier spoke the solemn-
truth, too —as Kruger also speaks in this same
connection. Johannesburg threatens to have
its own policemen. Broken Hill people long paid
for their own night-watchmen, and had hardly
any other protection; while even now the
Public-school accommodation is scandalously
defective. Nor did Government hurry to give
the miners the benefits of citizenship any more
than Kruger has done. Up till quite recently
the whole Barrier district had only one member
iu Parliament, under a provision in a special
Act which absolutely precluded parti6ipation
in the expansion clauses of the old Electoral
Act. Still we can be very “indignant” and
shocked over the Boers’ ill-treatment of Euro-
peans. It is always safe to “ barrack ” for
political some other country.
The Clarion (Eng.) writes of a “dead-
horse ” sweating incident at “ Collingwood, Vic-
toria, Queensland.”
An Edinburgh solicitor on the Dean case :
I myself hare just had a case somewhat like the Dean
case. R.D., a lad of 20, was apprehended and charged
for a serious crime. He admitted to me his guilt; yeti
advised him—following the ordinary practice ' td sav he
was innocent when he was emitting the usual declaration
before the magistrate. The Crown Prosecutor thereafter
made an examination inter the facts, the result being that
the charge was abandoned and the fellow got off, although
one word from me would have sent him to pr sen.
Now, according to Australian notions, I was engaged ia-a
conspiracy to defeat justices but, according to our view
here. I was simply-throwing the oiiiik pro cnU on the
Crown, admitting nothing, and making the best res 2 toi
mv client. If agents here were to be hell ,i,u ipiv w;i.\
resp-msible for the consequences of ad u.'al'of-<j>uil't 2 V •-
accused persons, they would refuse to defend prisoner., in
any way, a result which would not harmonise with
Scottish notions of justice and fair play.

All through the past week the temperature
has been falling in great chunks on the fire-blasted
city of Sydney, and theatrical business has been
at a low ebb. The villain didn’t care to carry off
the persecuted heroine, for the villain was damp
and uncomfortable, and when he pressed the
shrieking girl to his bosom it made his clothes
stick to him; and the shrieking girl was moist
and hot, and not a pleasant thing to carry. And
when, she embraced the manly hero the proceed-
ing didn’t feel nice, for the hero had broken out in
an awful perspiration in his final struggle with the
villain, and big drops fell off him into the foot-
lights. _ The Lyceum has held up best under these
distressing conditions, being cooled somewhat by
the breath of the peaceful, greeny, foam-flecked
sea that is painted on the principal back-cloth,
and covered by the imaginary shade of the big
white mainsail. “ John-a-Dreams ” has been a
most comforting drama during the hot spell, and
pretty Miss Faber, who always looks cool and plea-
sant, has been a vision of unutterable bliss,
like a large block of ice in the Never-Never
Land, or a snowball in Gomorrah the day that
luckless city pegged out. The Bulletin strongly
urges B. and B. to raise Miss Faber’s salary, on
the ground that she is the only lady in Sydney
who didn’t perspire visibly last week, and she
thereby set a blessed example to the community.
On_ Saturday “ The Passport ” is to be staged.
This is built on Savage’s fine novel “My Official
Wife,” the success of which set the author crazy
and started him writing weird shrieks full of
shadowy characters who flew round to no purpose
in impossible landscapes, and gibbered in ways
too complicated for description. The scene is laid
in Russia, and the drama will, if necessary, be
served up iced.
** * *
Shirley’s drama, “The Work Girl,” will
oe staged at Sydney Royal on Saturday for the
first time in Australia, and Scot Inglis and one or
two other favorites will join the co. on that
memorable occasion. Said co. is already pretty
strong, and if the new drama has any meat upon
it, it should do well. A small co. under the
management of Mr. Clitherow is playing “Little
Lord Fauntleroy ” at the School of Arts, with
Miss Jessie Clitherow, a child-actress oi great
promise, in the name-part. The “ Robinson
Crusoe” pantomime at Her Majesty’s does as
good business as ever, and seems in a condition to
hold its own for some weeks longer. The
Bulletin still adheres to its opinion that “Crusoe”
is a plain, dull panto, with a
great lack of new ideas in its soul,
and that a fine co. is wasted upon
it; but as the public evidently
doesn’t share this view, the paper
remains, as usual, in an intelligent
minority, and will be found there
until further notice.

Another instalment of Harry
Rickards’s new importations was
staged on Saturday at the Tivoli,
in the shape of the Crossley Sisters.
Saidjsisters are bright, intelligent-
looking, and do their business
without any absurd ideas of over-
refinement ; they seem some con-
siderable distance from toothless
old age, and even if they are not
overwhelmingly remarkable—
which they aren’t —they are suffi-
ciently nice for all ordinary pur-
poses. The rival show at Sydney
Music Hall is also taking to sis-
ters, and has put on the Chards,
two small maids who should prove
a draw. Mr. Charles Boosey lifts
up a fine tenor voice at this estab-
lishment, and otherwise the bill
is more remarkable for the enorm-
ous number of people in it than
for anything else.

Miss Marion Mitchell, the
“ girl ” of Pollard’s Lilliputian
Co., is a Wellington, M.L.,
young lady who never saw an
opera played until she began her-
self four years ago as Mabel in
“ The Pirates of Penzance.” That
beginning came about partly
through her father being a cornet
player, and partly because of
Marion always longing to get upon
the boards. Now she is enrap-
tured with the life. Outside
of the co. she has seen but
two operas and five or six
plays performed; she is quite
in love with Mrs. Brough. Her favorite
oharacter is Olivette, and Tier most admired
music Straus’s “ Menywar. She is small and
light and self-possessed, but long back when
singing Lady Jane’s solo in “Patience”—
“Slivered is the Raven Hair”—the orchestra
lights accidentally went out, and the ensuing
scene of darkness and the tumult of the
gods so overwhelmed her that she rushed off the
stage in tears. Some of her parts are—Nanki
Pooh, in “Mikado”; Marco, in “Gondoliers”;
The Duke, in “Little Duke”; and Josephine,
in “Pinafore.” On her arm she wears a beautiful
diamond bangle, the present of a French priest
who is leading an Australian flock. Her pearl
ring was thrown to her on the stage by a Perth
admirer. One gold brooch set in a wreath of
flowers was handed over the footlights at Rock-
hampton, and another came up from a Brisbane
audience with a note which said that Marion, who
hadn’t the slightest idea of the sender’s identity,
could learn it by writing him a note if she liked.
“ I thought it best not to like,” says the cruel
little girl.

Pollard’s Opera Co. has been doing good
work all the week to thin audiences in a luckless
house. But the curse that hangs over the Criterion
—understood to be the curse of Pastor Jefferis—
has flatly refused to be dissipated. Even the very
fine rendering of the “ Pirates of Penzance ” didn’t
lift the curse one inch, though the co. put its
whole soul into the production, and played it
admirably. Under these circumstances the man-
agement has decided to let the curse have its way.
It proposes to play “Erminie” to-night (Thurs-
day) and “Patience” on Friday, and on Satur-
day it opens at Newcastle in good old “ Paul
Jones,” and, The Bulletin hopes, amid better
luck.

“ Boom ” is an unorthodox term that feel-
ingly expresses the present state of evening and
matinee biz. at Melb. Princess’s. Familiarity
with the sweet Japanese spectacle only makes it
appear sweeter. These remarks, although in-
tended to rhyme, are weak in the matter of metre.
Further praise for the mounting of “Djin-Djin”
would be as superfluous as paint on a lily ; there-
fore The Bulletin hastens to chronicle a steady
improvement in Elton, irreverently known as
Billy, who has introduced some acceptable gags
and made himself more bright and cheerful,
whereas John Coleman’s style of humor remains
rather monotonously tearful. All the same,
the latter tickles old and youthful fancies
when he lets out his legs in a couple
of eccentric dances. His scarecrow figure in the
black suit and white gloves is so consistently droll
that it strikes a new sensation to every impres-
sionable weary soul. Miss Leonore Orelli is getting
along very well for a beginner, yet her songs don’t
show the fullness of the music that is in her.
Miss Young ■; almost airy when she twangs the
gay guitar am warbles of a Mary who was changed
into a Ma. (She hasn’t a guitar, by the way, and,
therefore, it isn’t twanged ; but, since a rhyme of
some sort was necessary, let simple truth be hanged !)
The fine, tall girl who stands for Rule Britannia
is just now a popular item, but the angel repre-
senting the Germans gets snorted at, because the
gods would like to fight ’em. In consequence of
furious cablegrams, they are thinking about the
Soudan goat and the late Mr. Dailey. Mean-
while, The Bulletin is not disposed to shed its
blood for any cause except the ballet, and if it like
a soldier fell, mortally wounded by a bullet from
the foe, its last prayer would be for a girl situated
near the centre of the front row.
Miss MARION" MITCHELL, as Stella, in “Tambour
Major,” at Sydney Criterion.
“ Santa Claus ” struggles along at Melb.
Royal, but already an enlightened public is losing
its faith in the home of pantomime, and a man
might often dive from the gallery into the desolated
stalls without hurting anybody else. This is a
sad and quite unnecessary state of affairs. A
dozen plans for waking up the pantomime suggest
themselves. A Melbourne lady has a tame lion,
and if she were engaged to take the stage in com-
pany with her noble beast the city would roll up
as one jingo. The lady, of course, would imper-
sonate Britannia, in a white robe and property
helmet, and the lion, crouching at her feet, would
just roar and lash his tail. There’s about =£soo a
week in that one idea. Even Miss Florence
Wilton’s version of “ Tommy Atkins,” which was
as dead as Caesar on Boxing Night, has developed
an awful popularity of late, so if the live lion be
not forthcoming Miss W. may as well produce it
in effigy, stuffed with straw, and give the Dear
Old England “gag” a reasonable chance. On
Saturday next manager Coppin will distribute a
gold watch among the Royal audience, in addition
to making a jubilee pantomime speech at the con-
clusion of the fire ballet.

M elb. Opera House works the ‘ ‘ Red
White and Blue ” lay by means of its two foreign
warblers, whose “turn” was suddenly hoisted
into prominence by the warlike utterances of the
cable liar. On Saturday the Ivanoff Bros, in
question had their tiresome medley duet, or what-
ever it is called, sandwiched between the unprece-
dented Alice Leamar and the unparalleled Harry
Rickards. All things considered, neither of these
special additions to the programme went for
what they are generally worth in a crowded
house. The boys expected Alice to sing about
her bicycle, which she didn’t, and the comparatively
unshocking character of her ballads took them
somewhat by surprise. No doubt they will love
her dearly anon, for Alice, anyway, gets the very
mst ounce of meaning from a doggerel verse.
Rickards’ new things are furnished with catchy
choruses, and will keep him well in the foreground
until he discloses a stronger batch. A five months’
absence has made no perceptible difference in the
veteran. His wiry voice goes as far as ever, and
his London tailor"has served him well. Abo, he
thanks the audience very sincerely with as much
deep emotion as heretofore.

“ Ransom ’ is the current horror at the

Ransom distinguishes it from Dan Barry’s
ordinary dramas, also the plot is more hopelessly
insane than any other plot know to this journal
A mud-stained bushranger captures a small

ruffian is on the point of shooting his man when

capital. Any sensible Kelly gang, under
these circumstances, would immediately tie

to the wicked squatter for another £3OO, consider-
ing that the squatter has designs upon the wife
aforesaid. Or the gang could save themselves a

Miss Maud Beatty, the “boy” of Pollard’s
Lilliputian Opera Co., is both a very nice boy and
girl. Born in Christchurch, M.L., where hef
father built the Theatre Royal as a speculation,
she went on the stage there at the age of seven.
Hers was a little part, but she pleased Grattan
Riggs so well that next day he took her out and
bought her a doll. And, after that, whenever a
company visited the Christchurch Royal, Maud
went every night drinking in the music, the scenes,
the dressing and the playing. When eleven she
was the Duke of York in G. C. Miln’s Richard
111. Her love for the stage kept growing; associa-
tions fostering the bent inherited from a grand-
father who, she remarks, “was
very much gone on the pro-
fession.” At thirteen she joined
the Lilliputian Co., and dropped
in for school, which she had hoped
to avoid; also, for church each
Sunday, which wasn’t as gay as
opera, and for devout choir-singing,
which wasn’t quite so free as the
rdle of Paul Jones. Maud sang in
the opera chorus for 18 months;
played Katisha, and was so nervous
at first that she dropped her fan
thirty times ; and later took lead-
ing parts. She has now been the
boy o* the co. for two and a-half
years and her pet is Paul Jones.
She nas also played Pirate King,
in “Penzance”; Pippo, in “Mas-
cotte ”; Giuseppe, in “ Gondo-
liers ” ; Ralph Rackstraw, in “ Pina-
fore ” ; Grosvenor, in ‘ ‘ Patience ”;
The Marquis, in “ Les Cloches de
Corneville ” ; Valentine, in “ Oli-
vette ”; Manola, in “ Princess of
Trebizond”; Chevalier in “ Er-
minie ”; Abdallah, in “ Forty
Thieves ” ; and others. She pre-
fers ‘ ‘ Mascotte ” music to that of
any other opera. Wellington is
the co. ’s gold - mine, for out of 12
months distributed over M.L. six
were spent altogether in the Em-
pire City. Miss Beatty has toured
all Australia and M.L. with the co.,
finding the most uproarious audi-
ences at Charters Towers and
Townsville, and the dullest at
Bundaberg where the imported
nig. sits on the white man’s chest.
She gets nervous only on rare occa-
sions ; as when, three years ago, J.
C. Williamson sat in the stalls
watching her Guiseppe. She never
tires on the stage, and when but 13
years old the excitement would
keep her up if she felt a little
weary prior to going on. “The
worst of playing boy,” says Maud, “is that
the old maids like you so, and all over
Australia and M.L. feminine Sunday-school
teachers follow us up and pray, and we sing
hymns, and get advice everlasting and texts ;
it’s a bit slow after opera. Canon Stonewigg,
of Brisbane, gave us all a Bible each and a
jolly dance in the schoolroom ; and the Rock-
hampton priests gave us some splendid music-books.
Mr. Pollard puts his fatherly hand over all letters
addressed in boys’ handwriting to us girls, and he
scrutinises the bouquets, too, for the hidden billet-
doux. But at rare intervals they miss him and
we get them, and it’s a joke. They nearly all try
to break the ice in one of two ways : they have
had an argument about you, and there’s a AlOO
wager on it, and do please write back as a favor
and tell them ; or else they are dying to know if
anyone is related to you of the name of So-and-So
—great friend of theirs, of course, dome artful
youths will get their Sunday-school sisters to
address their letters, or else send her to ask us
girls to afternoon tea and then turn up unex-
pectedly. But we all love the operas, not the boys,
so I don’t mind telling about the nonsense.”
All four junior medical officers elected co

A recently-discovered leper, a “foreigner,’
was incubated in one of Sydney’s most populous
suburbs, where he was vending speckled apples
and squashy bananas, coaxed to maturity under a
bed.
The smellful punt that receives the Sydney
suburban nightsoil, subsequent to removal out to
sea, was until recently called “ The Queen ! ”
Some loyal authority has since changed the name
to The Emperor ’’—which may yet lead to
strained international relations.”
An Albury (N.S.W.) Xmas drunk, with a
heavy record, stole an enormous German sausage
irom a shop, and, after welting every dog he met
with it, went to sleep in the Gardens, using the
meat as a pillow. Useful sausage ! He got
three months. The sergeant gravely informed the
bench that the butcher had kindly donated the
sausage to the local hospital patients.

Not proud, but rema-a-rk-ably free:

So, her cheek being pow-ow-dered and painted,
The dear’s pretty, red, white and blue.
Three cheeers for the red, white, and blue,
For the false which resembles the true,
And tne tales that expla-ain why she blushes,
Three cheers for the red, white, and blue !
Belinda’s the bard’s latest notion
Of a girl to take out on the spree,
The shrine of the railer’s devotion,
Where he drops all his spare l.s.d.
Then hooroo for each ’all demonstration
When the Union Jack cometh in view,
Like the flag of our great British nation,
Belinda is red, white, and blue.

“ Billy ” Walsh writes from New York, under date 2nd
Dec., that on arriving at ’Frisco he engaged with Minnie
Palmer to play the tenor part in a new musical comedy
commencing 23rd Dec. He heard Frances Saville sing
Marguerite at .the Metropolitan Opera House; she had
greatly improved, dramatically and vocally, and was
prettier than ever. Mine. Sapio was to sine at the end of
the month with Paderewski ; and Mine. Vanderveer
Green, billed as “ the English contralto,” had been sing
ing for the New York Orchestral Societv in “ Penseroso.”
Arthur Lawrence, once of B. and 8., was placing in the
“ Princess of Zenda,” with Sothern ; Brenda Gibson with
Irving ; Eleanor Carey with Richard Mansfield ; Nellie
M‘Henry in an up-to-date piece, “The Bicycle Girl”;
Walter Howe, travelling with “A Fatal Card” ; Harry
St. Maur, with Kyrle Bellew ; Alice Barnett (the gigantic
one), with “His Excellency”; and Billie Barlow, G. H.
Wood, and Jules Levy, the celebrated cornet-player, were
in various halls,
A Bulletin correspondent says that Monty Brown, the
popular ex-pressman and well-known theatrical agent,
who died at Jamestown, S.A., at 10 a.m. on 31st Dec.,
after a few days’ illness, of inflammation of the lungs, was
buried same day at 6.30. “ But this scandalous haste was
no fault of the authorities—it was caused simply by the
dilatoriness of the Govt and the people in not having a
proper place for the reception of the dead. Any
traveller, wealthy or otherwise, who happens to die up
here, unless he has the amount of burial expenses on him,
is shoved under the sod without a friend or relation being
any the wiser. Poor Browne’s is by no means the record
burial, for not long ago an unfortunate who suddenly
died at 9.30 a.m. was buried at 3.30 same day. And yet
there are standing here six or seven churches.”
“ The new prima-donna, Mme. Frances Saville,” says
’Frisco Argonant’s correspondent, “ made a good im-
pression at New York. She is young, has a beautiful
face and figure, is graceful in appearance and refined in
manner, and she has a light soprano voice which is even
but lacking in power. She was badly scared when she
made her appearance, and her nervousness affected her
voice. She flatted notably. But this disappeared as the
evening progressed, and towards the end of the opera she
did some excellent work.”
The Firm will play “Trilby” with an almost entirely
new company from ’Ome. This for the information of
sundry newsmongers who imagine that J. C. Williamson
is looking for a pair of local feet to put into the name-
part.
Jenny Lee introduced her spoilt young daughter (strike-
ingly like mamma) to the boards in South Africa, or some-
where, and the local press gave the damsel “ beans.” It
must have been sweet to hear ma Jennie discussing the
notices, and passing reflections on the beasts who wrote
’em.
Two Sydney girls have joined Pollard’s Co. this visit,
and are going with it on probation.
Pollard, of the Lilliputian Opera Co., says that, during
his many years’ experience through the length and
breadth of Australasia, he has come across hundreds of
good juvenile voices, but none to equal the Maoriland
children’s for purity, tone and stamina. Misses Beatty,
Mitchell, Sanford, and Metcalfe, the stars of his present
show, are all Maorilanders.
Percy, the leading youth of Pollard’s Co., plays Tambour
Major, Uncle Tom, Due D’lfs, the Bailie in Les Cloches,
Pirate King, Pooh Bah, &c., and learns a new part by
getting on his wheel, going into the country, and fagging
hard while slowly pedalling. He is a Melbourne boy, and
started with the co. five years ago, as a consequence of
loving the stage and being left an orphan. He doesn’t
like playing any one character more than three successive
nights. He is a modest youth—he says: “I never did
anything sensational; nevei-*paralysed anybody yet, or
stopped the traffic.” He is very fond of sketching ; he
will go out over-night with his sketch-book into the
country, sleep under a tree, and with dawn begin sketch-
ing. He does all the co’s scene-painting in the small
towns.
A Melb. editor wanted his reporter to ask Florence
Young and Maud Williamson the American question—
how they felt in tights ; but the reporter jibbed.
The Gaieties went ’Ome saloon, with a poor actress
second-cabin. Gaiety Lady No. 1 invited her to dinner,
in the saloon, but Gaiety Lady No. 2 interposed an em-
bargo.
Cockaigne : “ If you want a justification of Dacre’s fear
of being separated from Amy, visit St. Pancras Railway-
station, Sunday morning, when the theatrical companies
are departing, and see the poor sorrowful husbands.”
“Mr. Gilbert quite understood his public when he
furnished his operas so carefully with stout and mature
ladies for the express purpose of making fun of their age
and figure. Such fun has always revolted me ; and lam
waiting for the time when it will revolt the public too.”—
Bernard Shaw in Saturday Review.
“ The Firm’s” intention of producing “ A Royal Divorce
—announced months ago—has been declared “ off ” in-
definitely, owing to the difficulty in getting two suitable
leading women and a mummer with something of the
appearance of a Napoleon. Phil. Goatcher had already
started on the elaborate scenery, but he has now dropped
the work.
The reason given by J. C. Williamson for quitting
Sydney Lyceum when the lease expires is that it has, for
some time past, been a profitless undertaking. Melb.
Princess’s, the best-paying theatre in Australia, has
always returned twice the profits of the Lyceum.
“Djin-Djin,” at Melb. Princess’s, has accomplished the
record feat of drawifig packed houses every Monday night
since the opening.
Dear Bulletin, — Re some reminiscences of Amy Roselle
and her brother—from J.A.H., Wellington (M.) Your
correspondent is more or less out in his dates. “In the
middle sixties,” he says, “ Amy Roselle was playing with
Madge Robertson at the Haymarket, and Percy, her
younger brother, played Prince Arthur at Drury Lane,
and created a sensation.” Madge R. didn’t appear at the
Haymarket until late in the sixties, and Amy Roselle, I
fancy, didn’t join the company until some time after that.
Her brother Percy had disappeared from notice before
Madge Robertson became known. Percy must have been
older than sister Amy. He was a matured “pheno-
monen” when he “starred” as little King Pippin in a
Drury Lane panto. Later he made an expiring flicker at
Astley’s Theatre (under the management of L. L. Smith’s
father), and a very used-up boy he seemed. lam quite
certain that Amy Roselle didn’t attract attention in
London until Percy was beginning to be forgotten.—
Number Nip.
George Rignold has no intention of stopping longer
than three or four weeks in London. Before leaving Mel-
bourne, the other Saturday, he told his old friend, Dr.
Neild, that he meant to “do” all the London theatres,
see everydamthing, in fact, and be back in Australia at
Easter-working a show. A mistake. George ought to
take a longer rest from business whilst he is about it.
In Princess’s Theatre advts. in the Melb. dailies the
vanity of each organ is carefully allowed for. In the
Argus, extracts from Argus criticisms always head the
list; in the Age the taffy of the Age leads the band.
i S nl ne f^ ay th !f, ? rd ? r vvin be reversed by accident, and
then there will be deaths from fits in the front rani s of
Melbourne journalism.
The list of people engaged by Harry Rickards for his
‘ v ’■ and Sydney shows is a yard long, and contains the
names of several has-beens who should be fresh in Aus-
a ! ot of really good people in many lines,
r ••' s ates j is certainly the greatest spurt in music-hall
business Australia has seen.
Bignold and Alf. Joseph were fellow-passengers
and over farewell fizz with their friends had
their little joke. “ You’re eloping with Potiphar’s wife,
1 suppose ? remarked the bookmaker. “ No, sir. I
i/to, I j e „ a ,® on for leaving my own wife behind.”
“win S that? „ innocently asked the Leviathan.
well, you see, replied George with a grin, “ I knew
that we were going to have a Joseph on board.”
«^ A Ji? e T Leamar says that the first time she showed at the
houth London music-hall one of the gods waited on her
“ww. d ’,‘ Please > A,icp - rm king of the gallery.”

don t. give you the money?” enquired Alice. “Well,
Miss, we isses ’em.”
The £4O a week more than last Xmas which George
PI m pays for Melbourne Royal has been taken out of
taiP momime material, and the show presents an unmis-
it , ° f , e °°noiiiy when Florence Wilton isn’t
“ min' , he lucky importation draws a good salary, and
finds herself in handsome dresses, seemingly.
Cameron didn’t leave W. and M. on account of her
, east for Katisha, as stated. It was" because she
wouldn t play the character of Mrs. Bumpus, in “ Charity
egins at Home.” Elsie’s notion of her recent matn-
nionial importance rebelled against the prospect of
appearing as Mrs. 8., in shortish skirts, after the chorus
had enjoyed the humor of it at rehearsal. So the plump
lady threw up her engagement, and the world lost a treat.
A comedian would have jumped at a similar chance of
cutting a comical figure.

Lime, and the G.O.M. of theatrical life hopped over the
difficulty without pausing to consider that “ One, two,
three ! do it like me,” is a ticklish business for gouty feet.
A subject for a historical painting—George Coppin drilling

Although Elton’s fooling in “ Djin-Djin ” is, as usual, of
the dry and chippy order, it seems quite unctuous com-
pared with Coleman’s smileless method. Coleman, being
incapable of a laugh, makes the best of a bad job by
maintaining an extreme melancholy and calling it “ art.”
All the same, his part gave him a big pull over the more
aggressive comedian at the outset. Of late Elton has
introduced some new business, and begins to feel that he
is raising a genuine laugh sometimes.
Lucy Escott, the wife in late years of Henry Squires,
died recently at Paris. For years the couple lived in a
handsome chateau at Lake Como_upon their Australian
savings. Madame was the wife of Scott, for many years
property-master at Drury Lane Theatre. When she
adopted the operatic stage she did so as “ Lucy Escott,”
adding the initial letter of her second name to her
surname.
London theatrical newspapers announce the arrival in
the Big Smoke of “Mr. T. S. Amory, for many years
manager in all parts of the world for Barry Sullivan.”
When Barry Sullivan first arrived in Melbourne in the
early sixties he had with him a young gentleman known
as “ Tom Amory.” A year or two afterwards, when for-
tune, through Ambrose Ivyte, smiled on Sullivan, “m,v
son, Amory” was “transmogrified” into “my brother,
Amory.” Whether son or brother, he was an active agent,
and later on, when Barry Sullivan was unable to perform
in the English provinces, Amory took his place on the
stage for the tour and was considered fairly successful.
Much more is likely to be heard of the recent prosecu-
tion of Melb. Princess management for overcrowding on
the last night of the Gaiety. The case was dismissed
owing to the conflict of the police testimony. But it is
now alleged that constables who favored the theatre
people were recipients of free-passes. On the other
hand, it is retorted that the prosecuting policeman
took action in pique and that he and his friends were not
put “on the door.” Anyhow, the matter is scandalous
and should be departmentally probed.
At Salford, Eng., the other night, seven theatrical
people, who were stuck through the manager bolting,
refuged in the workhouse, and had only one penny
among them.
Alfred Moul, formerly of Melb., now manages the
London Alhambra. Millionaire Winans, this Xmas, gave
him £lOOO to distribute among the ladies of the establish-
ment. It went in sums from £lO down to £4. Winans is
a Philadelphia shipbuilder who, by ejecting families
wholesale to create deer forests, has made himself one of
the most obnoxious Scotch landlords.
Clement Scott was awakened, after midnight, by shout-
ing under his window. He threw it up, and called : “Is
there murder, or what?” “ Yes,” said a friend, “ Arthur
Dacre has killed Amy Roselle, and shot himself.” Scott
had to hurry to London Daily Telegraph office and
scribble reminiscences.

Frank Clark has been running a “ nerveless ” man in
his Adelaide show—one Hepburn, who calmly sits on a
chair while a committee from the audience runs bodkins
through his nose and pokes needles through his hands,
and generally jabs him all over. Hepburn apparently has
no sense of feeling, and it is suggested that he should be
run as a National Ass candidate at the S.A. election. And
what a “ hypnotic ” subject he’d make !
Mrs. Langtry is said to have another English nobleman
in tow—an earl, who some years ago distinguished him-
self by running off with the beautiful wife of a county
gentleman and subsequently married the lady. This
nobleman has now become Lily L.’s racing partner, and
they are inseparable. They special-trained to Paris, the
other day, after winning nearly £20,000 at Newmarket.

Phil. Stuart, who ran a Xmas musical festival, at Melb.
Exhibition, with success, seems to be now casting his
weather-h’eye around for a suitable engagement. The
Bulletin can only say of spry Philip what the stage-coach
driver suggested to David Copperfield “ That ain’t the
sort of man who ought to be sitting behind a box-seat,
is ’e?”
“ John-a-Dreams” (which was a failure in Melb. on its
first production) would probably go very well over there
just now. The yachting “sets” would gladden the
hearts of the Brassey grovellers. Only it would be
necessary to “ localise ” the author and change the
yacht’s name from the Moonbeam to the Sunbeam.

Bye-law passed by Rangitikei (M.L.)
County Council—
Any person riding a bicycle or tricycle, or other similar
vehicle upon any public road within the County of
Rangitikei, upon meeting any person riding any horse or
driving any vehicle drawn by a horse or horses, and before
approaching within sixty-six feet (66ft.) of such person,

Putting them under the Camel Act!
The firm of Parsons Bros. (Sydney), who,
with their Flaked Oatmeal, are doing more than
G. H. Reid and the Freetrade Govt, to make the
country jolly and fat, held a gorgeous festival at
Botany the other day, and drank toasts and fired
off speeches and had an all-round roaring time.
Many solid facts were brought to light at luncheon,
one of which was the firm’s motto “ Be true and
fear not,” but the largest and most solid fact in
evidence was the firm’s chief. It seems that
he started as an employe of the firm—as a wee bit
laddie; he is now a very fine fat giant and boss.
The firm is erecting new buildings in Kent-street,
Sydney, and will shortly manufacture jam and
pickles by the ton. It will also preserve this
country’s fruit in the very best style and manu-
facture a sauce which will be an epicure’s poem.*
That ‘ ‘ awful boating fatality ” at Kaipara
(M.L.) the other day produced a first-class hero
whose account of his own conduct has sent a thrill
through the community. There were eleven
people in the boat, and it capsized three miles
from shore. Then the story goes (as per cable): —
Edwards, who was a good swimmer, made most noble
efforts to save his companions. He succeeded in putting
nine out of the 10 persons in the water safely on the
bottom of the boat, but the heavy swell washed them off.
Edwards, persevering in his brave work, again placed the
struggling people on the bottom of i he boat, and a second
time they were washed off, and this time overwhelmed by
the waves. Finding that his efforts to rescue a num-
ber of the party were futile, Edwards then placed little
Edgar Armstrong, aged seven years, on his back, and
started swimming for the shore. He had gone two miles
when the boy was washed off his back by a great wave.
Edwards then-struggled along by himself, and after
swimming another mile reached the shore. He lay
exhausted on the beach for some time. Recovering, he
swam a river half-a-mile wide, and finally reached the
Omaunai settlement.
All this may be absolutely true, but if the present
writer had been a sole survivor and there was
absolutely nobody to audit his statements, he
would have come ashore and stated that he put
those nine people on the bottom of that boat eight
times, and that when they fell off he dived in 40ft.
of water and brought them up again, and finally
that he swam for the shore, eight miles distant,
with ten of them on his back, only they fell off by
the way. Also he would have widened that last
river considerably, or else have swum it several
times. When a man has the only authentic
account of his own gallantry he should make the
best of the occasion—either by saying a lot or
keeping his mouth firmly shut. Which latter way
is, perhaps, the better, after all.
The Emily Jane .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We own a steaming craft that may be slow,
But she’s sure and certain—is the Emily Jane—
Around the western plains where drovers go
She tramps the rivers in the heat and rain,
You should see her shoot the races of the flood ;
You should see her snag-poles walk when streams
are dry—
And you’d get the love we bear her in your blood—
The love we’ll bear that hooker till we die.
Tho’ the river life has its share of pain
There’s romance for your pay and the Emily Jane,
And you’re caught by a trip
On a river ship,
And you love every chip of the Emily Jane.
On the Darling, in the springing of the year,
We race to town chockfull of Tilpa clip,
With a roaring rush of freshets in the rear
And a chain of half-dry pools before the ship;
And her naked boiler’s hot —her slack a-blaze,
And at the bends her helm-gear groans and
squeals ;
And she walks those channels, crooked as a maze,
And wakes the plains with music from her
wheels.
In the blistering sun and the stinging rain
With her wool and the trade goes the Emily Jane;
With the trade and the wool—
Two bottoms full
In the blunt-nosed barge and the Emily Jane.
Her engine’s growl is surely unmarine—
It’s a “ portable,” adapted to the stream,
And the shaft is of a kind that’s rarely seen,
And the cranks are independent cogs abeam ;
The prow is scarred and gnawn by many fights
She’s had with snags and wharves and sandy
bars,
But she’s staunch and true as are her sponson
lights,
And she picks her way at night without the
stars.
Every scar on her hull that has given her pain
Has taught the helm of the Emily Jane;
And her engines learn
When to go astern
Erom the bars in the way of the Emily Jane.
There is music in the creaking of her decks
When her caulking bubbles upward to the sun,
And the frightened mallards crane their fluted
necks,
When our whistle shrieks just as the day’s
begun.
And her plashing floats will gurgle us the facts
Of her working, and her sweating, and her hire,
And the epic of her steaming in these tracts
When the stream’s a gutter ’tween two streets
of fire.
Shooting the bars in the seasons dry,
Facing the flood when the river’s high,
Bringing the world to the west again,
In flood or in fire goes the Emily Jane.
From Echuca with her hold and barge of stores,
She carries whisky, moleskins, wire and tea,
And timber for some gilded grazier’s floors,
And the produce of the cities of the sea ;
And, having sold, she loads up with the clip
From Albemarle, and Dunlop, and from Louth,
And, away on the new “ fresh,” the river-ship
Carries greasy gold to cities in the South.
Shorn from the sheep of the salt-bush plain
Is the wool in the hold of the Emily Jane ;
And wealthy and large
Is the loaded barge
That walks in the wake of the Emily Jane.
In the night, on the deserted river banks,
We “ wood her up ” and push her on again,
For a falling stream won’t wait for any thanks ;
And in droughty spring we “ send ” the Emily
Jane.
In the wheelhouse sits the mate and lies the chart
Not quite as long’s the rivers on it drawn ;
And from Christmas Island—where we’ll say’s
our start —
She does her hundred miles before the dawn.
And the engines growl, and the barge-tows strain
At the lumbering hull of the Emily Jane,
When the falling stream
Has just enough beam
To float the beam of the Emily Jane.
Generations of the river men she’s seen
Go down into a stream that’s strong and deep;
But no terror has that river ever been
To her —on one so safe she’d go to sleep.
She is used to dangerous wrestling with a snag,
On an ocean she’d be lost for want of bars.
Till her engines wear her out she’ll fly her flag,
Till she calmly sails in powder to the stars.
For greedy of work, as a man of gain,
And careless of fee is the Emily Jane;
In flood or in fire
Her work is her hire,
And her barge and her rope give her strain fol
strain.
The world to the desert goes in the load
That she bears in her tramp on the snag-sown
road ;
And in sun or in rain
Her barge-tows strain
North and west in the wake of the Emily Jane.

SOCIETY
CAMEO
Even now the Tine Australian superstition
is not quite dead. Another small party left Wel-
lington (M.L.) the other day for the Promised
Land where the revolutions grow, and one of them
writes a letter to the papers for the guidance of
future immigrants. By paying .£lO to somebody
at the Adelaide Democratic Club anybody can
proceed to the settlement “at his own expense.”
f He, can remain there three months to see how he
likes the prospects, and then if he decides to
become a permanent argonaut he must put all he
has—which must be not less than <£2o into the
common fund. If he doesn’t decide to join he
must go, naturally. If he hasn’t the £2O he must
go, also. And if, after he has joined, the ways of
the “ mates ” don’t suit him, his remedy is to go.
Paraguay is a pretty easy place to reach and a
very hard place to get back from. The latest
news is that leader Lane is very ill indeed, and
that his new settlement is just making a
living, but the old one is in a bad way.
The desire of every man to do no more
■than any other man has brought things
to a stage where everybody does hardly
a^y thing—except loaf and doze. The somnolence
of the sleepy land has entered into the community’s
soul. The cattle have dwindled to one-fourth of
the original number, the mates having evidently
lived on their capital of late. The supply of
poultry has gone down almost to nothing. They
don t quarrel much now and they don’t leave much
—the mates have apparently settled down to take
things pleasantly while they last, and when they
don’t last any longer they won’t take them.
Apparently the Rue Australians are now a
dreamy, summery, lotus-eating race dozing in the
Land of Pretty Soon—the land where everything
is going to be done a little later on in the tired
by-and-bye. Hardly any letters come now, and
the Association’s lecturer doesn’t rage any more,
and the Paraguayans have apparently drifted over
the Australian horizon for good.

“ Gorsave our Gracious” is ousting
“Sweet Marie” and “Molly Riley” in Mel-
bourne, owing to the blood-thirst induced by the
hot weather and the cable news. All the narrow-
chested bank-clerks, theweak-kneed softgoodsmen,
and the myopic youths of the Freetrade Reform
Club want to go forth somewhere—anywhere, and
fight someone—anyone. “ What would you do
if the trumpet sounded for battle ? ” asks a
young lady of a dyspeptic hussar officer in one of
Pinero’s comedies. “Oh, I suppose I should pack
up a few charcoal biscuits and toddle off, you
know,” he replies. That, and chronic “ Gorsave ”
is the feeling in Melbourne.
“O, LET US BE JOYFUL?”
THE OLD LADY : “Stop crying, you little fool, and sing. Here comes a ‘swell.’”
Lord Brassey’s scheme for capturing the
.affections of the people as he travels round is to
declare that the place he happens to be in for the
time is the most beautiful, healthy, and the most
blessed by God of any spot on the face of the
earth, and the people are the most cultured and
the most lovely and the most loyal people it has
ever been his happy lot to encounter. .Recently
he has been straining all his available language to
persuade Tasmanians that Tasmania is Eden with,
all the modern improvements, and that Tas-
manians, male and female, are simply away a-head
of anything else Nature has attempted up to date.
This is very nice of H.E., but it is wasted effort—
the Tasmanians have been quite certain on that
noint for years.

A well-meaning specimen of the Bible-
reading bore got a bad set-back recently. She
went to visit a dying woman in a slum, and told
her the usual commonplaces of her creed, while
the patient lay under a tattered counterpane and
regarded her suspiciously out of one rheumy eye
and one eye that was filmy and sightless. Then
the visitor saw a dusty Bible on a shelf, and
reached for it. “I will read you some comforting
passages,” she said ; but just here the patient
seemed galvanised into sudden life. She struggled
desperately to sit up, and lifted up a cracked voice
on high, “Gimme that Bible,’’she said, and the
Bible-reader gave it, in mild astonishment. Then
the patient groped hurriedly among the leaves,
picked out three pawn-tickets, put them for safety
underneath her emaciated figure, and fixed the
visitor with an eye like a glow-lamp. “ I knowed
you was after no good,” she barked ; “ you wanted
to get away with them pawn-tickets, did you ! If
I was up, I’d tear your false hair off ! I know
your sort! You’re a bloomin’ sneak-thief, that’s
what you are ! Get out of here, or I’ll knock your
bonnet skew-whiff with the Bible.” And a
shocked Scripture-reader tottered out, leaving the
sufferer raving on top of her three pawn-tickets.

The S.A. National Association is deter-
mined to seize every chance to discredit the King-
ston Ministry. At a banquet at Glenelg on
Commemoration Day, the local Mayor, a youthful
National Ass cock-sparrow, commented on the
allegedly mistaken policy of reducing Gov.
Buxton’s screw. H.E. and Premier Kingston
were present as guests, and whilst neither made
any reference to the incident in his reply, the
Governor is reported to have been much an-
noyed at this shocking exhibition of bad taste
When Gov. Lamington, of Queensland
(then Wallace Cochrane Baillie), sat as M.P. for
St. Pancras, he was reputed (says an English
paper) to be the best-looking man in the Commons.
Gov. Lamington (it is further stated) is not exactly
brilliant—which, perhaps, means that his intellect
is dominated by typically-patrician dullness. He
has travelled much “in the East.” The eternal
fitness of things is here again apparent ! Eastern
experience is, indeed, a prime qualification to a
Governor whose subjects so largely hail from
Hong-Kong, Colombo, and Yokohama. H.E. will
probably take up his head-quarters at Cairns,
where the alleged whites take off their hats to the
Chinaman.
* * * *
Premier Kingston is stated to be wild
because the National Ass Mayor of Glenelg so
arranged the toast-lists on “Commemoration Day”
that no member of the Govt., as such, had a
chance to deliver a speech. The Commissioner of
Public Works, who represents the district in which
Glenelg is situated, did manage to chip in a few
words. The omission of the toast of the Ministry
was the more marked because Kingston’s father
arrived in the province before Gov. Hindmarsh, am'
was senior assistant to Col. Light in the survey of
Adelaide.
A contributor
to a Perth (W.A.)
paper alleges that
during the recent
block on the tele-
graph - line be-
tween Perth and
Coolgardie, the
telegraph depart-
ment, on two
occasions, sent
batches of 500
telegrams from
Coolgardie to
Perth by parcels-
post. Obviously
the smartest thing
ever done by the
department. The
messages, if trans-
mitted by wire,
would have
reached Perth in
anything over two
days, whereas
they got there by
post in 24 hours,
besides which the
move immensely
relieved the con-
gestion of the line.
But the ungrate-
ful senders, in-
stead of appreciat-
ing the expedition
of the depart-
ment, and the fact
that there was no
extra charge,
think that they
should be handed
back the difference
between telegra-
phic and parcels rates on these messages. The
department was invited to contradict the allega-
tion, which invitation was not accepted.

What is claimed to be the largest pas-

Mark Twain, speaking on the AnMo-
Amencan row rc Venezuela, got off once mon ’the
dreary old commonplace that ‘"blood is thicker
than water. Anybody who has fallen unex-
pectedly over a suicide has probably noticed the
same thing. Also a native bear is a lot thicker
than water, which is quite as much to the point
A new funeral rite was inaugurated a
Adelaide last week by a bereaved hieb vnd. When
the melancholy cortege reached the graveside, it
was grouped, with the coffin as centi epiece, whilst
a photographer in black took three negatives from
different points of view. Moreover, he took half-
an-hour to do it in, because the funeral trappings
got shaken by the wind at critical moments, and
the hearse horses gave the artist a lot of trouble
with their expressions, winking when they should
have looked sad, and so forth. Also, the grieved
relatives grew restless. The coffin was the only
feature of the group that kept perfectly still all
the time.

Several young men walked behind the

the other day, dressed in mourning garments, but

Melbourne undertakers continue to pusli
their business with great zeal and discrimination.
The wife or nearest relative of a man who has
been carried badly battered into any local hospital
is pretty sure, within half-an-hour or so of the
event, to receive a visit from some sallow, crape-
bound canvasser, who extends his sympathy and
the card of Bones and Co., cheap cash under-
takers, with an assurance that people are never
really thoroughly content until they have been
buried by Bones and Co., style and fit guaran-

the Lancet, says: “Overwork of the stomach,
liver, or kidneys is vastly more damaging to a
man than overwork of the brain or muscles, since
so long as the stomach is intact, overworked
muscles may be easily repaired ; and so long as
the liver and kidneys retain their integrity, the
consequences of extra brain work are easily re-
moved by the elimination of the resulting poisons
from the body.”
This verifies the contents of a little explanatory
free medical pamphlet on health, recently issued
by the vendors of Warner’s Safe Cure, Melbourne
(obtainable by sending post-card), in which they
prove clearly that if the liver and kidneys are in a
sound, healthy, and consequently active condition,
health is ensured, and the experience of thousands
in Australia, equally as satisfactory as the one
given below, shows that Warner’s Safe Cure is
the best liver and kidney medicine in the world.
Mr. T. S. Garratt, of Wellington, New Zealand,
says :—“ I take great pleasure in recommending
Warner’s Safe Cure, having been a great sufferer
from the liver during my prospecting trips around
Coolgardie, W.A. Being in Coolgardie one day,
someone told me to try Warner’s Safe Cure, which
I did at once, and am glad to say I have been in
the best of health ever since using it. lam happy
to recommend Warner’s Safe Cure fts the most
efficacious remedy that I know for liver complaint.’

Abortionist Sheridan made some extra-
ordinary admissions shortly before being' executed.
His written statements are very mild reading
compared to what he appears to have said. Part
of his alleged confession will be published at an
early date ; and should be an eye-opener to those
soi-disant purists who think the Jessie Nieholls’
case an isolated one, and fail to see the necessity
for a public foundling-home and lying-in hospital.
* * * *
The Australian Star, in its report of the
Sheridan execution, was particular to mention
that he was hanged well: —
The body hung for 20 minutes, and was then cut down.
The execution was so satisfactory that the man being
dead ami being killed well it would seem out of place to
find fault, but as we are informed that it was only
Howard’s fault we might point out to the Sheriff that he
might give Howard instructions to obtain a sharper knife
when he attempts to cut the rope after the body is laid
in the basket. The sight of a grim-visaged person like
Howard kneeling over the body and sawing the rope with
a soap-knife is too bad even for the most callous. In-
stead of having to saw with a blunt knife for many
minutes Howard could easily procure a knife that would
cut through with one stroke.
Botany Bay is indeed becoming particular. The
Bulletin wants to shed a tear over the fact
that the knife was blunt, and it regrets still more
that they cut the rope at all, and thus spoiled a
valuable asset which might have helped out Treas.
Reid’s deficiency. But, above all, it wants to sing
a few sweet verses about the man who was hanged
well:
A man was found drunk on the banks of
the Yarra the other morning, minus trousers.
After being run in and revived, he declared that,
to the best of his recollection, he had a pair of
check pants on when he went to sleep. He was
duly fined, and serve him right. No respectable
citizen can afford to go to sleep in the open in
these days of the New Woman unless his pants
are secured to him with a burglar-proof padlock.

A stranger in a Sydney suburb, arrested
for drunkenness, was duly fined. After “ the
rising ” he and the constable had a drink at the
pub opposite. It turned out they came from the
same town, and two more followed. At lunch-
time the sergeant and constable were in the street
together. 44 There's a drunk,’ said the former,
44 run him in.” “That’s the man we had last
night,” replied the cop; “give him a chance.”
NO, run him in.” And in he went.

Dr. Lloyd, the North Melbourne J.P., the
ladies’ friend, has much faith in marriage, although
he has had to do with more failures than most
men. In a recent case he advised defendant to
marry “ this fine, healthy girl. ” “ Couldn’t keep
her,” pleaded the young man. “ Nonsense !” cried
the J. P.—“ she can keep you. ” This view seemed
to please the defendant, and he and the girl went
out to knock up auctioneer-parson Kinsman.
Now, how will Lloyd look if in the course of a
few months that man sues his wife in the North
Melbourne Court for maintenance ?

A Toowoomba Chinaman lately wrote to
Kwong Yick Wah Bo (Sydney Chinese paper)
that a European gentleman had come to visit
his garden, but didn’t visit any other
Chinese garden. The gentleman said
that the Chinese were very industrious,
V V11V VillllVUV V.J :
which was civil of him. Then the
Chinaman gave the gentleman an
orange—which was pronounced to
be the largest that the gentleman
had ever seen. Subsequently he
(John) found out that the gentle-
man was the Governor, Sir H.
Norman. He was very sorry
that he did not know this at
the time, as he had a bigger
orange, and if he had
known who the gentle-
man was he would have
given it to him.
Dear Bulletin, —
Re the R.C. priest and
his kindly treatment
of his nag : the pre-
sent-day “father”
may be that way
inclined; but I have
a recollection of a
couple of back
numbers who were
quite the reverse.
They used to ride
to a standstill any
animal they got
across, and yet they
were tw r o of the
most jovial cards
who ever wore the
cloth. They hunted tie Devil in and around
Armidale a matter of five-and-thirty years ago,
and they generally hunted ‘ ‘ his nibs ” on bor-
rowed horses. My father (who, poor man, would
lend his shirt for the asking) often obliged these
two warriors with the loan of our horses, and they
always had to be put out to grass on their return.
Rest your sowls, good Father Tim M‘Carthy and
Dean Lynch—you were good to me, anyway,
when I was a boy. Many’s the pound of lollies
your long-tailed coats carried for me. — Jack
Shay.
Dear Bulletin, — Re Tas. hospitals. There
is in connection with them nothing like the amount
of voluntary effort met in other provinces. Govt,
pays about nine-tenths of the whole bill. Wrote
Premier Braddon in Tas. Democrat of Nov. 15 :
“In Sydney-and Melbourne, Hospital Sundays are
held, and sums amounting to from £5OOO to
MEASURED BY A MAN.
DESDEMNA : “Yes, my dear, tailor-made .”
OTHELLO: “ What! do you mean to tell me that you were actually
measured for them?”
DES.: “Why, certainly ; and what have you got to say about it?
O TH: “ Only this (and he hissed it betiveen his clenched teeth), who’s
YOUR TAILOR?”
£lO,OOO collected in a day. But in Hobart and
Launceston the State (i.e., the ratepayers of the
whole island) provide the entire cost.” —J.D.
It is saicl that the Itofe family are interest-
ing themselves on behalf of the unfortunate Mrs.
Butler, with a view to retrieving as much as pos-
sible the injury done by T. E. Roffi. If this is so,
it will help considerably to better young Rofe in
the public eye, besides being but just recompense
to a much-injured woman.

Great excitement prevails at the offices of
the Melb. Board of Works re the fighting in the
Transvaal. The draftsmen, about half of whom
are Germans, argued so long and fiercely over the
respective merits of Eritz ard J. Bull, that when
the German band started playing “Rule Brit-
tania,” under the windows, the argument cul-
minated in something very like a free fight.
Sweating ! Two
weeks ago, a Melbourne
reporter swore, on the
Holy Gospels, in the
Criminal Court, that
he had been recently
employed, on a local
morning paper, at a
salary of £2, and that
he worked 72 hours a
week. The story goes
that the suburban cor-
respondents of one
“ great ” Melbourne
daily paper are at pre- -
sent paid a fixed salary
of 7s. (id. a week for
their work- the same
wages given to a nurse-
girl, minus the bed and
board. And these
wretched literary hacks
—for many of them
are men of literary
attainments are re-
quired to be at the
police court daily at 10
a.in., and to wait, on
“ council - night,” till
the mayor and council
rise, at 11. They
mustn’t “miss” any-
thing in their districts
—tire, sudden death,
“smart arrest,” wed-
ding of the grocer’s
daughter, death of the
landlord of the oldest
grogshop, send-off to
the saynior constable,
or raid on a toteshop.
And all for three half-
crowns a week ! The
miserable “ penny-a-
liner ” used to be the
scorn of the crushed tra-
gedian and the penny
poet in years gone by ;
but, now, the Melb.

The other day a European woman, married
to a N.Q. Kanaka, when nearing her confinement,
swallowed a quantity of white paint. At first
it was looked upon as a case of attempted suicide,
but the husband emphatically denied this, and
said that his wife’s idea was to bleach the coming
infant.
They hanged him well in the early morn,
He hung on a rope there all forlorn,
High up on a gallows tree ;
And around the man who was hanged so well
To the measured note of a slow iron bell,
So satisfactorily—
Stood the preacher man to see him go,
And the hangman, and the carrion crow,
And the scribe of the evening Star ;
And the shadows went and the shadows fell
from the summer sky as they hanged him wen
By the neck from a creaking spar.
Then they eased the line, and down he fell —
This man whom they had hanged so well-
And they cut the greased rope through ;
For the rope that hangs and is sawn away
May serve to hang some other day
Another man or two.
Some men, alas ! we grieve to tell
They weren’t strangled quite so well
With quite so long a fall;
And some of them were badly slung
From a rotten beam and a frayed rope hung,
And some not hung at all.
But nothing bent, or broke, or burst,
That summer morning in Darlinghurst,
So the daily paper said ;
And the newsboy, with his strident yell,
Told how that man had been strangled well,
Till he was wholly dead.
His life was bad and his aims were low,
And he went at last where bad men go,
To the spreading gallows tree.
And his epitaph has naught to tell
Bevond the fact that they hanged him well,
That day in Janu’ry.
The hangman’s thoughts have a pleasant hue,
For he loves not a hanging to go askew,
As hangings sometimes must;
But this one went like a marriage bell,
For they pulled the bolt and down he fell,
And the world is glad, for they hilled him well,
In pleasant Darlinghurst.

A header bold he took.

And Jack, himself, was shook.

Then suddenly—O, dear !-
The cause of his complaint grew plain,
Poor Jack was full of beer.

Sydney,
January 14, 1896.
Mr Dear Moorabinda —
Mi. Bayley MacArthur, lately one of Acting-
Gov. Parley’s aides-de-camp, was married, the
other day, to Miss Kitty Campbell, of Cowra.
There really was “no ceremony, only a service,”
as the girls say, for everything was very quiet.
By most men, it would appear, a quiet wedding is
regarded as best of all, and is the privilege of the
unofficial who needn’t make Punch-and-Judy
shows of themselves at every serious phase of
their lives—as Royalty must if it wants a head to
balance its crown upon. Miss Campbell wore a
white silk fete dress with toque en suite and
snappy diamonds, the gift of the bridegroom ;
her going-away suit was dark-blue with a pink
blouse and a pink and white floral hat. Miss Enid
MacArthur was the only maid, in butter-color
silk.
Another quiet wedding, last week, was that of
pretty, blue-eyed Miss Louise Mack, the gifted
Australian authoress, with Mr. Percy Creed, bar-
rister. As the wedding took place at her mother’s
residence the bride wore a simple dress of white
muslin, which probably became her style better
than old crusted brocade. And, apropos of mar-
riages, a widdy got re-hamessed the other day,
and, according to the society scribesses’ descrip-
tion, her gown was most wildly allegorical—it
seems to me—for it was green, shot with pink and
striped with brown.
After all, the apparently unreasoning rush of
girls to Christianise the badly-tailored Chinaman
may be only another frantic attempt at matri-
mony, thinly veiled in religion as usual. The
matrimonial advt. in a Sydney daily, to the effect
that “ Young lady wishes to correspond educated
Chinese gentleman, com. position,” is a distinct
amendment on the male Australian sentiment,
“The Chinese must go.” John must go—“tc
the altar.”
Of course, it’s very becoming to say “ Ugh ” at
the thought of anybody honeymooning with
Hooki Lah, but you must admit that Chinamen
exercise a strange fascination over my poor, dear
sex. If any woman is disposed to deny it let her
look into her heart of hearts and see if there isn’t
a much warmer regard there for her purring
vegetable John than for all her other tradesmen
put together? And if a yellow heathen, in a
dubious shirt and blucher boots, seen through a
mist of worm - eaten cabbagee, can mash so
universally, can you wonder at a woman, who has
acquired the taste through purchasing many
callots, or perhaps in a class at a Chow Sunday-
school —the most dangerous ground of all, adver-
tising for an educated Chinese gentleman ?
After all, marriage with a gilded Chow would
not be very much more degrading than buying a
white husband in open market as happened in a
town of my acquaintance a few years ago. She
was a lady of fifty-eight who had hung in the
wind matrimonially for some time, although she
was a well-bird-limed branch on the virginal tree,
having heaps of money. She hooked a youth of
about 24, who, ere relinquishing his gilded billet.
easily persuaded his fluttering Dulcinea to settle
.£17,000 on him—his price, apparently—and when
I was there last, about four years since, she was
driving about in a bridal-looking bonnet beside her
purchase—l mean her bridegroom. There are
many forms of matrimonial degradation—that
sort of thing doesn’t stop short at a Caucasian
marrying a Chow.
Really there are not half as many divorces as
there might be if men and women hadn’t grown
so philosophical over such things. I heard the
other day of a professional man who left his wife
and three charming children to go and sit in the
pocket of a leg-artiste lately playing in a big Aus-
tralian city, who called herself by her friend’s
name and filled the wifely role in all respects. It
was not until the pair arrived in Melbourne that
the deserted one got on their track and called in
proper person. The actress came down to her.
“May 1 see Mr. Blank?” enquired the wife, in
average conventional tones and evincing no desire
to disarrange the other lady’s back-hair. “He
is out, but will be back presently. Do be seated
And when the errant husband returned and
found his legal pansy in the parlor, instead of
performing with her umbrella, she threw her arms
round his neck and wept, and implored him to
return to the path of duty with no questions asked
and ample forgiveness thrown in, and he replied,
with emotion, that he would certainly think it
over, and then they parted most affectionately,
and he let her out of the door himself and told
her quite feelingly to mind the steps. Can you
conceive of a more philosophical position ?
And it s not only women who are tolerant of a
breach of matrimonial etiquette—which apparently
is about all such things amount to nowadays.
Men are beginning to forgive also, in a manner
that discounts all the colicky expressions of repul-
sion and horror that he-actors make in problem-
plays when Mrs. Tank and Kate Cloud go into
details. For instance, a man lately arrived at an
up-country hotel in a great state of mental agita-
r°?iT~r e i d k rac ked his wife and his supplanter
to that pub., and now he only wanted a policeman
to help him m surprising ’em in flagrante delicto.
The policeman was some miles off, but the
hubby possessed his soul in something resembling
patience until he arrived, and then, backed up by
bobby, the landlord, and a lodger, he went up and
knocked loudly on the bedroom door. Out came
the gay Lothario attired in his pyjamas, and
u d , m the fair and flighty spouse. When
the husband saw her he made one wild dive at
hei, but, instead of shaking her, he caught her in
his arms in most loving style and rushed back into
the room again ; and before the door shut, the
astonished group outside heard him affectionately
remarking: “My own dear wife, I love you more
than ever ! And when he drove off with her he
paid all the bills he and her Don Juan had run
up. Ihe only possible explanation of such marital
magnanimity is that she wasn’t his real wife
either.
A rather difficult incident occurred during the
u uS* 1 ' J ourney of a mountain train the other day—
difficult m the sense that people didn’t exactly
know how to interpret it. The train was
moving away from a small and dismal platform
when the guard began to wave red and green flags
simultaneously, and perform all the signals in the
railway-code at once. The train came to a stand-
still, and then the guard, with an agitated man
and woman, tore along the track to one of the
carriages, climbed in and hauled out a small
flabby infant which he firmly handed over to the
aforesaid agitated man, and the train proceeded.
Plow, the question is—if the guard hadn’t seen the
infant as the tram slid by him would the legal
owners thereof have waved those flags as he did
and stopped the caravan ? Is this a new
wrinkle in infant-desertion ? The moral that juts
out of this puzzle-picture undoubtedly is : Never
hold a totally-strange infant in any public convey-
ance while its owner goes out to have a look at the

Bachelors’ wives and old maids’ children are in-
variably better brought up than other people’s
and, therefore, as a convincing spinster, I may
say, with some degree of impressiveness, that the
way some women manage their travelling stock is
positively barbarous. I was journeying, the other
day, with a pretty woman and two babies. One
was an imp and the other a cherub ; nevertheless,
when the imp bawled the cherub got slapped. If
the imp dropped anything, the cherub had to pick
it up and get slapped again—really, you never saw
anything more like the whipping that boy Russian
royalties are said to have. In the end, the broken-
hearted cherub succumbed to his miseries and
wept too, but silently and unag’gressively—
t? d i whacking he got was a masterpiece.
If children only knew, as fortunately for their own
sakes a great many of them seem to do, that to
bawl and howl and scream at the first hint of
•chastisement saves them from many a maternal
injustice, every nursery would be a raging sea of
row. I have seen it repeatedly. When bad-
tempered Billy is howling, mamma, who is
frightened of further improving on the volcano,
in nine cases out of ten relieves her feelings by
slapping good little Ebenezer.
Apropos of babies, here is a pathetic remark
made by a baby of four, who is obliged to have
one of his legs in irons. His mother asked him
what he would like her to give him for a Xmas
box, when the poor little mite solemnly replied •
“ I would like you to take the sticks off my leg
please, mother.”
It is cabled that Brigadier-General French is to
take Major-General Hutton’s place as principal
Jingo in N.S.W., so the political influence which
the other candidate was supposed to revel in must
have run stiff at the last moment. The imposing-
sounding Brigadier-General French is the plain
Colonel French who was popular in Bananaland
a good many years ago. At that remote period
he was tall and lean and sunburnt—an affable,
soldierly person who hadn’t the Army very much
•on the brain, but was devoted to his pretty
•children.
While the gun-boat Karrakatta was bucketing
about off Launceston during her recent visit to the
Tamar, there was as usual, a great deal of competi-
tion among the shore folk as to who should give the
popular officers their best day ashore. One haw-
haw youth, who carries more shirt-cuff to the
square inch than anybody else in Tasmania, and
whose trousers turn up on their own account
whenever it is raining in Piccadilly, thought he
had hit upon the show of all when he issued invi-
tations for a kangaroo-battue. The sea-dogs
gladly accepted and put in a merry day bowling
the game over. But picture the horror of the
“ original ” host when, on his return to town he
was waited on by a policeman, who informed him
that he had gone a-hunting in the close season for
kangaroos, and that the fine for such a blood-
thirsty party as his had been would be excep-
tionally heavy. He isn’t going to seek alter novel-
ties in the entertainment line any more, and the
worst of it was that kangaroos, in themselves,
were no novelty to the Karrakatta people, who
had on board a tame wallaby, belonging to the
doctor, when the gunboat left Sydney station last
November.
The death is announced of Miss Mary Sheridan
Reed, a Sydney vocalist, of greater repute in the
near past than at the time of her death, though
her voice retained much of its former strength and
sweetness. She will be greatly missed in the
approaching Lenten services at the Anglican
Cathedral, in which she always took a principal
part. Like most Sydney vocalists, Miss Sheridan
Reed repeatedly sang for charity’s sake. And,
apropos of music, I am requested to say that Miss
Colbourne Baber and Mr. Harrison White do not
leave for Europe until April, but continue teaching
up to then.
If those hordes of impressionable young woman
who tore after Mark Hambourg with birthday-
books to be signed—if, I repeat, those hysterical
maidens only knew that, when Mark had scribbled
in a few, he got tired of the exertion, and let a
well-known plump Sydney musician do the rest —
well, perhaps they wouldn’t all be so fond of
kissing the genius’s autograph before going to bed
at night.
Writes my Melb. correspondent :
“A seasonable device at Melb. church-bazaars
is a huge Christmas-cake, dispensed by Santa
Claus in costume, at 6d. per slice, plus the chance
of breaking a tooth on the thimble, the sixpence,
or the ring, not to speak of the parish parson’s
signed-and-sealed promise to marry the finder to
the partner of his or her choice without fee.
Strange, the prevalent craze for matrimony on the
cheap ! How will a Romeo, unable to produce
the price of the initial ceremony, negotiate the
rent of the dove-cote, Juliet’s tram-fares, and all
the rest of it ?
“ One constantly hears the alleged longevity of
the Jews ascribed to their fidelity to the Mosaic
sanitary code. Either Moses’ ideas on cleanliness
were not up to the present-day standard or else all
the Chosen are not so mindful of his famous
system as they get credit for. The other day
when 300 devout Hebrews, who had come as far
as the Cape in a Melb. -bound vessel, reached their
destination, their beds were promptly flung over-
board after them. As the other passengers watched
the last mattress sink, they gave three heartfelt
cheers at the prospect of peaceful nights in store.
“ Melbourne writhes onco more in the throes of
pic-nic mania. The symptoms of the epidemic
are varied, but the tete-a-tete phase is most
common in society. A chaperon and equal num-
bers of youths and maidens are the necessary
elements, and everyone is paired off with someone
else, preserving the same formation, nolens-volens,
to the bitter end. Two strangers, without an idea
m common, who have been chained together for
hours, seldom invite a similar experience ; neither
does the girl who gets hold of a ‘dummy.’ A
man told off to a fright or frump is less to be
pitied, as he escapes on the plea of forgotten
engagement or indisposition, and is run to earth
later on, assisting the prettiest waitress in the
arrangement of the collation, or spoiling sport by
playing gooseberry to another fellow’s tete-a-tete.
Meadow-parties,’ popular in suburban cir-
cles, begin at 5 p.m., when the guests arrive with
provision-baskets, which they hand over to the
caretaker of the local recreation hall, who gets
tea, while the picnickers play tennis or row on the
lake. I< or this species of entertainment, a plump-
looking bundle is the chief requisite, there
being no way of detecting the donors of ‘ shabby ’
contributions. At a recent gathering, the hungry
promoters on assembling for tea found little to eat
except bananas. The dame in charge, undaunted
by the monotony of the proceedings, had earned
her fee and fulfilled the contract by 4 arranging*
the viands to the best advantage on superior
crnna and electro-ware ! ’ Bananas overflowed the
salad-bowl, the sandwich-dishes, even that gem of
the display, the plated ’berry-and-cream-stand.
Ihe spread was a ghastly failure, and the famished
culprits unable to fall foul of fellow-defaulters,
found their only consolation in circulating whis-
pered rumors regarding alleged provender-
peculations of the attendant ancient, who
with a conscience void of offence, smiled and
bustled and whisked the cover off her hot-water
muffin-dish, only to display more yellow-
skmned vegetables. Afterwards it was remem-

“ Another sea-side (Vic.) boniface suffered
agonies at the hands of a stout dame of Yorkshire
extraction, who always would describe her in-
ternal symptoms at meal-times, and invariably
declined indigestible? in such formulas as
‘ Stoomach can’t stand potatoes!’ ‘Liver don’t

“ A recent Bulletin par. describes the dilemma
of a Brisbane drill-sergeant in his dealings with
Grammar-school girls. That dear old dead-and-
gone Melb. identity, Herr Techow, of the
National Gymnasium, always rounded the risky
corner neatly by saying, ‘Draw in de vaists,
young ladies ! ’
“ Apropos of the German war-scare; when Lieut.
Techow’s pupils, past and present, got up a sub-
scription to help to send the homesick patriarch to
Europe to see the Fatherland before he died, he
was not allowed to set foot on German soil because
he had been implicated in a student-rising 40 years
before ! It gave the old man his death-blow to
find that his long, weary exile had not atoned for
his youthful indiscretion, nor erased his name from
the list of traitors to his beloved country. The
sting lay in the fact that the alleged rebel was so
desperately sensitive to the honor of his nation
that a pupil could not even mention sauer-kraut in
his hearing without coming in for a heavy imposi-
tion.
“ Mrs. New Hebrides Paton has bought a
charming villa and grounds in the pleasant suburb
of Kew (Me!lx), with the returns from her
recently - published ‘Letters.’ The chatty
authoress, like Zimmerman, resolved ‘to make
money or bust,’ when, a year or two ago, hubby
announced his intention of devoting all the profits
of his successful ‘Life,’ with an appendix of his
wife’s letters, to the New Hebrides mission. The
veteran missionary is a tearful old sentimentalist,
but he has proved his devotion to his life’s work
-by his recent offering of =£14,000, handed over the
other day to the Melb. Presbyterian Assembly,
for the purpose mentioned. Some years ago, pa
Paton was informed that his family had just been
increased by twin boys. He promptly burst into
tears and exclaimed, ‘ Thank God ! two more mis-
sionaries ! ’ However, the little duplicates were
short-lived, and their bereaved father had to con-
tent himself with his four elder sons, who are now
all missionaries, theological or medical.

absolutely correct coolie dress.
“Marriage as a profession for girls is getting

The “ Manhattan” Luncheon & Tea-rooms,
“ Basement,” Equitable Buildings, George-street,
Sydney, are the largest, coolest, and most popular
in the city. If you are in search of a first-class
mid-day luncheon or afternoon tea, look in at the
above rooms, where you will find the cuisine the
very best obtainable in town. In order to enhance
the attractiveness of afternoon tea, Miss Shaw,
the proprietress, has made arrangements for the
attendance of an excellent string band every
Thursday afternoon, between the hours of 3.30
p.m. and 5.30 p.m.*
Oscar Bailey, once of Sydney, and lately
of Adelaide Hansard staff, is to be the first
editor and manager of the Norseman Miner
(W.A.). By the way, it is now fashionable to say
that the Norseman is the coming W.A. field.
At a goat-and-pig-infested Darling River

Dear Buxletin,— Dr. Brigham Brown
seeks to justify the “ manly art,” and advocates a
little bloodshed in connection therewith. Cer-
tainly, let us box and wrestle and tauten our
muscles and nerves, but there must be limitations.
The Placke-Barker prize-fight was a brutal spec-
tacle-hardened men heroes of a hundred
scrapping bouts, called it so, and all the fight is
probably thumped for ever out of the big Dutch-
man. Remember, every member of “the push
prides himself upon his pug-abilities. Put him to
fight for blood and he shows himself a cur, unless
it is the other fellow’s blood that flows. Also,
history and a number of other things tell us that
the man who lusts does not fight. Women were
ever the undoing of brave men. In warfare the
clean man —he of one woman is always first in
courage honor, and the virtues that go to make
nobility of character.— Thorold W.
Gov. Hampden’s father, whom Gladstone
sent to the House of Lords, voted there against
Gladstone’s Home Rule Bill. It is a historical
fact that Gladstone counted on the new lord s Vote
in his favor, as Brand, while Speaker, was a
thorough Glads.tonian, and so sure was the party
that he would vote straight that Ins name was not
“noticed on the list of non-contents or opponents
for some time after. Hal'cowrt, mom..*! .'nor-
wards, lamenting the defection of many lords
whom Gladstone created, said in a speech, “One
after another they betrayed us ; one after another
they voted us down ; but Hampden stood firm oil
our side, one true friend in the midst of false ernes.’
Harcourt, when he learned the true state of the
case, sat down heavily. On the other hand,
Brassey, another Gladstone creation, voted
straight for the Bill.

Mayor ISAAC ELLIS IVES, of Sydney.
Sir John Willoughby, who came to griei
along with Dr. Jameson, is an ex-turf-plunger.
He won the Epsom Derby a few years ago.
Labor-leader Trenwith is a much-certifi-
cated Freemason, anent which it is pertinently
asked “ Can a good Mason be a good Labor-
leader ! ’
The much-advertised Calvert’s Westralian
visit has boen, in most respects, a ludicrous fizzle.
There is such a thing as overdoing “ bold adver-
tisement.”
Thomas Hardy’s latest book, “Jude, the
Obscure,” was set up in a Melb. weekly recently
as “ Jude, the Obscene,” which is just how many
people describe it.
Sir Joseph Renals, late Lord Mayor of
London, now on his way to Australia, wrote to
the press denying the report that “his wife began
life as dressmaker.”
The North Melb. local paper corrects a
mis-statement of general currency in re the birth
and parentage of Dr. Maloney, M.P. His father
was also a Dr. Maloney.
Angus and Robertson will shortly publish
Edward Dyson’s verses —mostly from The Bul-
letin —in the same form as “ The Banjo’s’’neatly-
produced “ Man from Snowy River.”
N.S.W. Just Ice Minister Gould has taken
for six months Judge Windeyer’s residence at
Roslyn Gardens, Darlinghurst. Thus does the
eternal fitness of things assert itself.
A correspondent says that it is Miss Lena
Cooper, only daughter of the late Charles Cooper,
who has blossomed into a novelist—not Miss
Ellen Cooper, daughter of baronet Daniel.
Miss Emma Cecile Ann Huntsman is likely
to be Melbourne’s first pharmaceutical chemist,
having almost completed the course for that certi-
ficate. She is a daughter of chemist Thomas
Huntsman, of Fitzroy.
One of the sights of Melbourne is Marshall
Lyle taking exercise on the St. Hilda beach steam
merry-go-round. He does it for the sake of his
liver, which, ever since the Deeming advent, has
been the man of law’s “ lord and master.”
Mrs. Yellow Aster Mannington Caffyn
seems to have forgotten inuch about Australia
since she went to London. In her new book, “ A
Comedy in Spasms,” she makes an Australian girl
talk of what can be learned “ at a Board-school.
Three recent candidates for N.S.W. Par-
liamentary seats have suffered under the law. One
was sent to prison for vagabondage ; a man who
contested a city division was locked up for alleged
park-prowling ; and Sheridan, of the Glebe, was
hanged.
“ Prince Henry Battenberg,” says the
Age’s London correspondent, “ has announced his

Sheridan was the first R.C. executed under
the chaplaincy of Father Carey, at Darlinghurst
raol. Although the little priest did not witness
the actual butchery, he was muoh upset by the
previous proceedings, and is now in a low con-
dition of health.
Barton, Q.C., and R. E. O’Connor have
been retained to argue the points reserved by
Justice Cohen in the case of attorney Meagher.
It is, however, considered in legal circles that the
strongest point which could have been raised was
not reserved at all.
There recently met together eonvivially in
Adelaide a croup of S.A. pioneers : W. L. Beare,
4ed 6? arrived July 28, 1836; Wm. Hodges,
73, arrived August 18, 1836 ; G. E. Strangways,
76, and H. T. Morris, both of whom arrived with
Hindmarsh, 28th Dec., 1836.
A bright and able Australian scientist who
died the other day, had lately been in the habit
of drinking three-and-a-half bottles of whisky
per diem on the average. After his death, 17
empty whisky-bottles, less than a week’s accumu-
lation, were found beneath his bed.
At the annual celebration of the pro-
clamation of S.A. last month was present W. L.
Beare, aged 69, who arrived on 21st July, ’36, in
the first ship (The Duke of York) sent out by the
S.A. Co. He is the sole survivor of the vessel’s
contingent of passengers and crew.
Mrs. Ellis Rowan, the Australian flower-
painter, has just refused a very big offer
from a London firm of art-decorators, who
wanted her to work solely for them. She is one
of the Macedon Ryans, and thus related to pretty
well all Melb. “ sassiety,” and a fair slice of
English ditto.
Dr. “ Pat” Moloney (Melb.) once inserted
his finger, by permission, in Deeming’s mouth,
“to feel the shape of the murderer’s palate.”
Frederick Bailey, unable to waste such a chance
of indulging his impishness, made a savage snap
at the doctor’s digit. But Moloney saw wnat was
coming by the light in Deeming’s eye, and promptly
knocked down the would-be cannibal.
Asked his age, the new Mayor of Sydney,
Mr. Isaac Ellis Ives, laughingly replied, “It
doesn’t matter.” Born at Great Waltham, Essex
(Eng.), he began life’s battle when 14, with the
rudimentary education gleaned at a village school,
toiling for years in a London merchant’s office by
day and at night working at a night school. In
’57 he came to Sydney by the Waterloo, a Dunbar
liner, and was for three years employe of a Sydney
brewing firm and worked well in the interests of
“nut-brown draughts.” He managed the Argyle
Bond from ’6O to ’76 ; then he became sole pro-
prietor. The Bond, wherein he has now worked
for 35 years, is within almost a stone’s throw of
where the ship which brought him to Australia
dropped anchor. Mr. Ives was North Shore Mayor
from ’79 to ’B4, and first chairman of the everlast-
ing North Shore Bridge Committee. He was
M.P. from ’B5 to ’BB when he resigned, “ satis-
fied.” He was elected a Sydney alderman in ’93
and Mayor on 9th ult. He has been twice
married.

at Melb. Princess’.
p)r. Knaggs, editor of the Australasian
]vjt;dioal Gazette, has presented his fine medical

SO ci e ty—for the use of the profession generally,
Justice A’Beckett has been spending his
vacation tramping through Tasmania. He com-
plains that sundowners are not treated “respect-
fully” in the little island. But as soon as it is
grasped that any swaggie may De a Supreme
Court Judge in mufti, all that will be changed.
Apropos of The Bulletin’s par. (Jan. 4)
rc the eccentric Countess of Caithness, a corres-
pondent writes saying that the heir to the title of
Earl of Caithness is an ordinary rouseabout in the
North Island of M.L. Ho has a great penchant
for horses. His younger brother is a member of
Sydney Permanent Artillery.
Henry Lawson’s book of verses (nearly all
Bulletin matter) will be published this month
by Angus and Robertson. It contains a number
of marvellously good things, and will have a large
and permanent sale. Lawson, it will be found, is
the bard of the walking bushman, as “ Banjo ” is
the bard of the bushman who rides. ,
Baron Von Mueller, Australia’s great
botanist, now three score and ten, should have
been retired by the superannuation-at-60-rule ever
so long ago, but, as there is and can be only one
Baron, Vic. Government extends his tenure every
now and then, and will doubtless wisely go on
doing so till the old man dies at his post. The
Cabinet has just given him another three months,
on the ground that the Baron is not a man but an
institution.
Vic. Attorney-General Isaacs the other
day received a deputation of one peripatetic lady-
lecturer, who claims to have originated the
woman’s-suffrage movement down south. After
some miles of aggressive oratory, she handed
Isaacs her portrait, for which he thanked her, and
then placed it on the mantelpkoe. As he was
about to bow the elderly lady out, she informed
him that there were “two shillings to pay, please.”
After she left he swore strange Hebrew swears at
himself.
Gov. Gerard Smith is tall, with a London
Journal air of distinction. His public utterances
evidence the fact that he is greatly impressed with
the weight of responsibility m being the represen-
tative of “ Her Most Gracious Majesty,” &c. But
he is learning, and was careful to explain, in his
swearing-in speech, that he was quite aware of the
limits of a Governor’s powers in a province under
responsible government. This evidently in reply
to criticisms on his lapsus at the farewell banque
in London. Westralian society, which is less
democratic than that of the East, and therefore
does not yearn for earls to the same extent, is so
far quite satisfied with him.
Miss Florence Young,
as Prince Eucalyptus in the
“ Firm’s” gorgeous “Djin-
Djin ” show, marks a very
great improvement on the
amateurish girl who played
a pantomime prince, at
Melb. Royal, half-a-dozen
years ago. The stage ex-
perience gained in comic
opera enables her to walk
gracefully through a part
that lies due south of her
line of character. Miss
Young isn’t a dazzling
principal boy. She wants
the volatile method and
educated legs of a burlesque
specialist. But the general
effect produced by this
alert young Melb. native
in an Australian rational
costume is a feeling of
thankfulness for her hand-
some presence. “ I wish
to speak of great things
with gratitude,” says an
inoffensive person in one
of Pinero’s plays. The
Bulletin, cherishing the
same noble ambition, speaks
gratefully of Miss Flo’s
pantomime performance.
It is a great thing to get a
twenty-guinea voice in a
cheap comic song. A
Spanish onion boiled in
champagne would not be
much more unusual. The
subject of these enthusi-
astic comments possesses a
beautiful voice—a pearl of
price, which only needs
careful polishing to reveal
its market value. If the
Trilby mesmerist were to
fix his evil eye upon Miss
Young and order her to
sing as she ought to sing
after two years of peaceful
vocal culture across the
seas, she would probably
astonish herself. A voice
which grows stronger and
more mellow on the hard
work of W. and M.’s eternal
opera season, which never
seems to catch cold, or want
a rest, or show any ill
effects of a too vigorous
style of production, must
be a first-class article in
rude health. Miss Young’s
voice is the immediate rea-
son for another publication
of her photo. Not her con-
scientious singing, intelli-
gent acting, or charming
appearance in a red flannel
shirt and “such and suches, ”
out her Voice, with a capi-
tal V. This journal hopes
to sing in the same choir as
Miss Young when we are
both angels.
When Hell-fire Jack M‘Lean was driving
his boat in some very bad weather, he was annoyed
by the attentions of a well-known Sydney society
lady. 44 Oh, captain, do tell me what s a good
thing, in case I should be sick ? ” “A damn good

headquarters, and the answer came back : Sorry,
madam, but we don’t know anything better.
, Queen Victoria, writes an English paper,
is beginning to act queerly. Not long 0 she
forced her entire court and household to don
mourning and attend the funeral of a young
medical student, whose only claim to her con-
sideration had been that he was the nephew of her
favorite personal attendant and gillie, the late
John Brown. At the solicitation of Princess

remarks that William Morris “ has long aban-
doned true poetry and taken to Socialistic preach-
mg, which is thoroughly incompatible with the
P? et 8 vocation.” A piece of ignorance quite
characteristic of the Age in discussing a literary
matter. As a fact, some of Morris’s best work
has been done since he became a declared Socialist
—notably his splendid “ Odyssey of Homer don#
into English Verse,” his “Songs by the Way,”
and his “House of the Wolfings”—not to speak
0 f his quite matchless prose romances, such as
“ The Land of the Glittering Plain.”

H. DON NAN, the N.S.W. huntsman
H. Donnan, the N.S.W. present top-notch
batsman, began his cricket successes in ’BO at the
age of 15, by winning Sydney Grammar School
first eleven’s albround play trophy. He joined
the Sydney Orientals and scored altogether in
junior cricket five centuries. In 10 years of senior
cricket he has put up nine centuries and one 200.
In in ter provincial contests he has played during
eight years 52 innings (seven not-outs) for an
average of 31, second only to s and
Moses’ records. His recent 100, 46 and 93 against
Vic. and S.A. are worthy of any champion,
especially as he went in first each innings
and bore the brunt of the attack. He was
sent in first because he is all pure grit.
Were N.S.W. batsmen for the Aus. Eleven picked
on interprovincial performances, Donnan would
be first. Were the Aus. batsmen picked on
present form, Donnan would be first. ere they
chosen for never being out until the umpire s
decision is given or the wicket down, Donnan
would be first along with the best. V ere they
chosen for temperance and decent lives, Donnan
would be as good at least as the first. Giffen and
Percy M’Donnell always championed him.
“ Giff ” will fight for him tooth and nail; perhaps
Garrett won’t.

POLITICAL
POINTS
By re-enforcing the Act passed long since
rendering Corporations and District Councils
liable for the payment of half the cost of main-
taining all foot police, under the rank of sergeant,
stationed within their borders (a law long in abey-
ance), the S.A. Ministry hopes to close the present
financial year with a surplus.
The first speech delivered by Queen Vic-
toria on coming to the throne contained the fol-
lowing words : “I regard with peculiar interest
the amendment of the Criminal Code and the
reduction of the number of capital offences. ” At
the end of her long life she can find in her Botany
Bay dependency as many offences still capital as
her first Parliament pronounced a scandal on
English justice.
When it was proposed that the N.S.W.
Parliament should grant £lO,OOO or so to Parkes
that grand old man wrote expressing his willingness
to accept the offer. Then the session closed with-
out anything being done, and Parkes wrote again
■withdrawing his acceptance. So for the present
the veteran is a stern Roman patriot who won’t
take the money at any price. If it is offered next
session he can accept again ; if it isn’t offered he
can keep on refusing to take it. It is all so like
Parkes.
Bellicose Australians whose blood, accord-
ing to phrase, tingles to carry England’s colors in
the Transvaal, Venezuela and elsewhere, should

oe compelled to learn by heart the subjoined
passage from Wentworth’s poem of 70 years ago :
Wentworth was a Tory in many respects, having
been educated in a Tory school, but his ideas on
war as here expressed, should give the noisy
“ patriots ” of to-day some rational nutriment.
Most of the trouble about Yictorian-made
liquor arid cigars being sold under bogus foreign
labels arises from the utterly pig-headed convic-
tion of the average Australian that his own manu-
factures are no good. In many cases they are
better than the imported article —but it is neces-
sary all the same to brand them as inferior foreign
goods to secure a market. The Australian is a
curious animal in many ways. He swears consis-
tently by his own scullers, bruisers, cricketers,
footballers, and the like. But he imports bishops
and parsons because he reckons no Australian is
good enough ; he will seldom believe in an Aus-
tralian actor, singer, or author unless he has first
gone ’Ome and passed muster there ; and in very
many cases he won’t drink Australian wines and
spirits, or smoke Australian cigars, or wear Aus-
tralian clothing, unless he is beguiled by the lying
assurance that they are an inferior foreign pro-
duct. If the A.N.A. could persuade its members
to use locally-made goods in every possible case, it
would do more good than all its abstract whoop-
ings about its alleged great country will ever
amount to.
At Balclutha, the centre of Maoriland’s
prohibition district, a magistrate recently made a
remark from the bench that prohibition in these
parts was a distinct failure. He said it after
fining a number of drunks and a whole lot of
people who had been caught selling drink, and
listening to the evidence of sundry informers
who related the various devices they had resorted
to in the search after evidence. His remarks were
further based on the fact that liquor seemed to be
worse and groggeries more numerous that in the
old licensing days. And thereupon an influential
Cold Tea deputation, supported by Parson Isitt,
waited on Minister Reeves and truculently de-
manded the magistrate’s removal from the dis-
trict. He was, acknowledged Isitt, “an able
and impartial administrator,” and the deputation
didn’t even assert that his remarks were untrue ;
but when the Cold Tea horde gets uppermost it
has got to be humbly lickspittled by all authorities
whether the truth is sacrificed or not —or
else there will be trouble. That was about the
way Reeves summed the situation up as he showed
a bitterly aggravated deputation to the door, and
the Cold Tea vote is probably lost to Reeves for
evermore.
For the first time in

Sydney Telegraph :
“ The return to Ereetrade
has not been long in furnish-
ing a practical illustration
of what may be expected
here when the duties are re-
moved. Lever Bros, have
decided to erect a mill for
the treatment of copra. . .
Three years ago . . Free-
trade tendencies first at-
tracted the co. here as
tallow - buyers. ” Query :
Lever Bros, first came tal-
low-buying in N.S.W. dur-
ing the Protective epoch, so
how, in the name of all
that is wonderful, did
‘‘Freetrade tendencies” at-
tract them ? Also, as there
never was any import-duty
o i copra it naturally fol-
lows that the Reid Govern-
m nt hasn’t taken any duty
off, and things in that line
are just where they were.
Consequently, if the Levers
were attracted by Freetrade
i must have been on the
g ound that Freetrade made
wages lower, for there is no
other visible advantage.
Will the Telegraph please
explain ?
Maoriland National Ass
now calls itself the “Na-
tional Party,” and starts
out with ’ the following
beautiful programme : (1)
To promote a national senti-
ment ; (2) To promote the
development of Maoriland ;
(3) To promote sound poli-
tical reforms ; (4) To oppose
unwise legislation; (5) To
elect the best men to Parlia-
ment. It doesn’t Say what
kind of national sentiment
it means to promote, and
any sentiment, good or bad,
held by the whole nation
may be called national.
Also, it doesn’t explain how
Maoriland is to be deve-
loped : nor mention the
nature of the sound reforms
it advocates, or the unwise
legislation it opposes; or
give samples of the “best
men ” who are to be elected
to Parliament. In fact, the
Ass demands that the public
shall simply “ go it blind.”
Parkes’s friends are beginning to barrack
vigorously in the daily papers. One cordial
supporter urges that the old man should get a
magnificent testimonial from the State because he
wasn’t quite so extravagant with the borrowed
money as Stuart, Jennings, Dibbs, and some other
of the province’s awful financiers. The largest
amount he added to the public liabilities in one
year was £2,832,000, while the other people
habitually went over £3,000,000 per annum—and
once got a good way over £4,000,000. In other
words, Parkes is entitled to a big testimonial
becaus'q, though he was hideously extravagant,
some other men were a lot worse. Which logic,
applied in another 'direction, would mean that
Sheridan should have got an annuity from the
Treasury because he wasn’t so bad as Deeming.

Dear Bulletin, —
Treas. Holder is not in
favor of completing the
transcontinental railway
to Port Darwin on the
land-grant system. The
recent N.T. Commission
on which he sat recom-
mended this, but he was
a dissentient to that
portion of the report,
and has since publicly
emphasised his objec-
tion.
When the Boodle-
wraith amended the
Queensland Electoral
Act, so as to get every
claim registered attested
by a J.P., it would have
been as well to make
sure that all those gentry
could read and write. It
is painful for an elector
to have to carefully ex-
plain to a J.P. what his
duties are re electoral
forms, and then to find
the magistrate wanting
to sign with a cross.
Shortly after Judge
Windeyer leaves, N.S. W.
authorities will, chiefly
in his Honor’s interest,
release the survivors of
the Mount Rennie
massacre. So long as the
remaining wretches stay
in gaol, so long will the
stink of the trial con-
tinue to be smelt by all
men. “Turn them out
of gaol,” says officialdom,
“and there will be no
more squeal or smell. ”
Premier Seddon has gazetted himself one
of the liquidators of the B.N.Z. Estates Co. at a
handsome salary. Possibly he does it beca/use he
thinks he can liquidate better than most other
men —but it looks like a hungry grab at the loaves
and fishes, and it will materially help along his
downfall.
A GOOD SYMPTOM.

Under the new Vic. Railway Act, the
man ger has no power to discharge or reduce the
pay of a single on the lines ; and though
his five bosses, the trustees, can do so, their action
is liable to be reversed by Parliament. So the
good old log-rolling days will come back again,
when the man who has been drunk on duty will
bail up his member to get him reinstated under
pain of losing his vote and the votes of all his
friends and relations, and the Government must
grant the request under pain of losing the mem-
ber’s vote. .And the department-trotter will
haunt the ministerial offices in the good old
fashion, and nobody will be distinctly responsible
for anything, for the manager will be bossed by
the trustees, and they will be bossed by the
Minister, and he will be bossed by Parliament,
and Parliament is more or less bossed by the
people, and there will be no finality anywhere.

In the first week of January the Vie.
revenue got £29,000 ahead of the estimate, and
thereby reduced the previous half-year’s shortage
by nearly one-third. That sound like an earth-
quake in the distance was Premier Turner
breathing again as he saw the blissful coin rolling
in.
Lilley’s paralytic stroke must
put an end to his political aspira-
tions. Regret is keen both among
the pronounced Labor men and
the moderate Oppositionists; for
it was generally conceded that
Lilley was the one possible leader
in the next attack on Boodlewraith.
The average Australian, who
is always complaining about the
failure of the police to keep order,
is a discouraging person. On New
Year’s night five Sydney citizens
who were returning at midnight
from a banquet, were summoned
by a police-sergeant and a con-
stable for shouting, howling, and
playing the. fool generally, and
refusing to cease the disturbance
when remonstrated with. And
thereupon they and some of their
friends called an indignation
meeting at Waterloo Town-hall,
and the meeting, on the bare assur-
ance of the accused that they hid
. not rioted around as alleged,
“ unanimously ” demanded that the
sergeant should be removed. Evi-
dently no policeman who knows
when to come in out of the wet
should interfere with the antics of
any citizen who is influential enough
to get the loan of the Town-hall to
tell his ex-parte story in. As the
sergeant’s allegations were more or
less admitted (the banqueters ap-
pear to have got off on the ground
that “ a little allowance ” should be
made for people who yell in the
street after New Year banquets),
The Bulletin presumes that the
official head of the police will pro-
tect the officer from the impudent
aggression of these cheeky poten-
tates.
There are sharp heart-burnings in the

Yet ne’er, my country, roll thy battle-car
With deadly axle through the ranks of war !
Of foreign rule ne’er may the ceaseless thirst
Pollute thy sons, and render thee accurst

Invading legions sallying from thy shore,
A distant people, that shall not on trhee
Have first disgorged its hostile chivalry.

According to the N.S.W. Public Service Act,
no person can enter the service after the beginning of ’96,
unless he first insures his life for an amount not definitely
stated in some office doing business in N.S. Wales,” said
policy to be payable at age 60—so as to provide for his
support on retirement—or death. This has many advan-
tages over the Superannuation Fund swindle, as the policy
is not forfeited in case the insured retires from the service
before 60 ; and in case of early death it makes a substan-
tial provision for his family, which the Fund didn’t. At
the same time, it is far from being sufficient. Considering
the dubious character of one or two offices “ doing busi-
ness in N.S. Wales,” and the fact that others may become
[rubious later on, there is no positive guarantee that the
insured will ever get his money, and the State has no
right to compel anybody to put his money into a concern
unless it is prepared to guarantee the solidity thereof,
lnere is no more morality in compelling him to put
his savings in a possibly cronk insurance office than in
compelling him to put them in Pambula gold-shares.
If life-insurance is to be compulsory, it should
be m a State insurance office, where the money can’t
possibly be lost unless the State goes utterly insolvent.
The compulsory-insurance system should be made ap-
plicable to all present public servants below the age of.
say, 45, and to all future ones of any age. With such p
clientele, the State office might be made by far the bes;
in Australasia, if not the best in the world. At the out-
set, at all events, it could do with a Sydney office only.
As it would not depend on show, any kind of watertight
premises would answer, and the rent would be infinitesi-
mal. It would employ no agents or collectors, for the
Treasury would collect the premiums by a deduction from
salaries. It would pay no commissions. It need do no
large opexpensive advertising. It would have no arrears
of premiums ; no losses through defaulting agents ; no
“special expenses for the extension of business.” It
could invest its money entirely in State securities, pro-
vided the Government gave up the absurd practice of
floating its new and conversion loans in London and
created a continuous local supply; and, though the rate
of interest realised on its investments under these circum-
stances would be low, there would be no ruinous writing-
down of depreciated mortgages, which would compensate.
The Government office would take whatever business it
could get from the public without paying commissions or
resorting to the other expensive devices of private offices,
and, in course of time, it would probably get a great deal.
But in any case, it would start with a big connection and a
big reliable income ; and, with the vast saving in com-
missions, agency expenses, rents, advertising, and mis-
cellaneous glare and frill, it should run its business for an
expense-rate of 2 or 3 per cent, of its total income, against
the general Australasian average of 13£ per cent. And, on
these terms, it should pay the biggest bonuses in Aus-
tralia, as well as proyiding absolute safety to its insurers.
The Bulletin has said all this before, but it is the sort of
thing' which wants to be said many times and driven into
the public comprehension with a pile-driyer.
Under the N.S.W. Act, the public servant’s
compulsory policy can’t—while he remains in the service—
be assigned, borrowed upon, sold, seized by creditors, or
annexed by any legal process whatever. This is a good
rule, and, so far as concerns the seizure by creditors, it
ought to be extended to cover everybody’s policy up to a
limit of, say, £5OOO. That amount, at 31 per cent., which
seems likely soon to be the highest safe rate of interest,
would bring the widow and orphans an income of £175 a
year—which is certainly a low enough minimum.
* • * *
The Victorian revenue for the half-year is
£112,000 less than for the corresponding half of ’94. The
three months, July to Sept., showed a big rise, but then
the drought assumed an aggravated form ; there was
hardly any wheat carriage on the railways for want of
wheat to carry, and the railway revenue declined,
in the Oct.-Dec. quarter, to the extent of £65,000;
and a general paralysis set in. The Govt, has paid off
£250,000 of the old deficiency bills out of revenue, and
now it is understood that some way must be found of
saving another £lOO,OOO to make the accounts balance,
and Premier Turner is on the weary retrenchment job
once more—with a resolve to get the balance-sheet about
level or burst. The rich men of the province kept in such
beastly good health last half-year that the death duties
were £26,800 less than the average, but one or two of
them are not looking so well now, and hopes are enter-
tained. Premier Reid’s simple device of taking between
£300,000 and £400,000 out of loan funds and putting
them into revenue doesn’t appeal to Turner, and he is
after a real—not a mere book-keeping—surplus, which is
a very hard thing to get these times.
* * * *
More rumors of strange Govt, finance come
from Queensland. The Q.N. bank holds about £4,000,000 of
Government money, and as it only claims to have
£1,750,000 cash at all its branches it would obviously have
some difficulty about a sudden payment of this large
amount. The Government professes to be going in for
railway-building on a large scale, and wants anything up
to one or two millions for the purpose, and it lately
announced that, insuead of floating a new loan, it would
Iraw the required amount from the Q.N. Bank. This
news came as a shock to the public, which hasn’t heard of
the Government withdrawing any money from the Q.N.B.
for such a long time that the State deposit of £4,060,000
had come to be regarded as utterly petrified. Now it is
alleged that the Government isn’t actually going to with-
Iraw the money; it only proposes to borrow perhaps a
million of its own coin and give Treasury notes in
exchange. The bank pays £45,000 a year interest on the
million in cash, whereas the million in Treasury notes will
cost only £20,000 a year interest—a saving to the bank of
£25,000. The Treasury notes, which the State must pay
in gold sooner or later, will serve just as well as gold in
case of a run on the bank. If this scheme is carried out
it would, therefore, appear that the State will pay £25,000
a year for the use of one million of its own money, and
be practically no more secure than it was before, for
instead of the bank holding £4,000,000 of Government
cash, it will then hold £3,000,000 cash and £1,000,000 in
the State’s I O U’s. This is just the kind of finance which
grows in Queensland these times.

The National Fire and Marine Insurance Co. of
Maoriland held a depressed annual meeting a few days
ago. Since 1891 the annual premium income has faded
down from £131,000 to £83,000. In 10 years the reserve
has depreciated from £117,000 to £70,000 and the
“reserve for the reinsurance of current risks” has
decayed from £74,000 to £27,000. Under these painful
circumstances the 15 per cent, dividend looks somewhat
reckless. Said div. absorbs all the profit except £l5O,
which doesn’t look like a very vigorous attempt to rebuild
the battered reserve-fund.
♦ ¥ * *
The estimated value of all rateable property
within N.S.W. municipalities in 1894 was £151,000,000. In
1895, despite the fact that the municipal area was con-
siderably increased and many new buildings put up to
add to the aggregate value, the total is set down at only
£136,000,000—a drop of 10 per cent, in only "--r.
The total value kept steadily increasing until 1895, when
the decline first set in. Also, it is a notable fact that 1895
was the first year when country lands showed a decline in
value. After the bank-smash year of ’93 the value of the
metropolitan area declined heavily, but the increase in
country lands more than made up for the loss. In ’95,
however, the value of country properties went down with
a violent drop of nearly £3,000,000.

The New Zealand Insurance Co. has made a
profit for the past year of £32,954, and £18,609 brought
forward from 1894 makes a total of £51,563 available. Of
the year’s profits £5OOO has to go to a sinking-fund on
account of a certain Auckland lease, and a dividend and
bonus of 13f per cent. (£27,500) practically absorb the
balance. Said profits, though sufficiently good, are
£12,000 less than they were last year, and last year
wasn’t quite so good as ’93. The co. puts £6.<00 to invest-
ment fluctuation fund to cover depreciation, but it takes
this amount out of the balance left over from previous
year’s profits, and it ends the year with £6OOO less to
credit of profit and loss than it had at the beginning.

During 1895 the Victorian butter exports to the
United Kingdom alone increased 3,000,0001 b. over those
of ’94 ; the cheese exports increased 600,0001 b. ; the export
of rabbits and hares increased from 11,000 to 459,000 ;
poultry from 1350 to 34,000; fruit from 2000 to 11,000
cases ; eggs from 11,000 to 23,000 dozen; the exports of
Victorian frozen mutton increased by nearly 100,000
carcases ; Victorian wine exports rose by 104,000 gallons,
and brandy by 13,000 gallons. Except in the matter of
meat and wool, for which the province lacks the necessary
area, Victoria is the greatest exporting province in Aus-
tralia, and by far the most progressive, and in the variety
of its products it leaves all local competitors far behind.

The W.A. revenue for 1895 showed an increase
over ’94 of £575,000 ; in other words, it rose 60 per cent,
on the previous year’s record. In proportion to popula-
tion Westralia’s revenue, in these good boom-times, is
half as large again as that of any of the other provinces.
And the Government “ blews ” it all gaily and a lot of
loan-funds as well, and expects the boom to last for ever.

The mucli-whooped-about exports of N.S.W.
wool to Japan, which trade that province is being wildly
urged by the daily papers to preserve, at any cost,
amounted in 1894 to £BlB3 - out of a total*wool-export of
£9,000,000. Also, there was an export of meat to the
value of £1267, and against this the imports of Japanese
matches alone amounted to £1857.

Japan, in 1893, exported coal to the value of
£600,000, and the export is now probably close up to the
N.S.W. total of £BOO,OOO a year. The Japanese coal-trade
only started a few years ago, and already, by means of
cheap labor, the Jap. has annexed a great deal of the
N.S.W. foreign trade. It will be interesting, when the
proposed line of Japanese vessels runs to Sydney, to see
if these Asiatics will try to cut out the Newcastle coal-
miner in his own market. Cheap labor, cheap ships,
cheap sailors, and the advantage derived by a silver-
coinage country in its trade with a gold-coinage one
might make it possible, if the Jap. coal is a high-class
article. Moreover Japan has just annexed the splendid
coal-fields of Formosa, which ought to make its trade
boom. The Bulletin presumes that the Reid crowd
will admit Jap. coal free.

J. S. Reid, who took up Ashcroft and his
sulphide process on this side of the water, writes publicly
that the Sulphide Corporation (Ashcroft’s Process) Limited
and the American Sulphide Corporation (Ashcroft’s
Process) Limited have been “formed in London under the
auspices of the Messrs. Rothschild, each with a capital of
£1,000,000.” He adds that Mr. J. H. Smith, late chief
S.A. Railway Commissioner, accepted the post of London
manager to these companies “in preference to a very
favorable proposal made to him by Mr. Cecil Rhodes to
take the management of the Cape railways.” This J. S.
Reid was formerly a director of the B.H. Proprietary.
Eleven or twelve years ago he struggled in Silverton to
establish a paper there. He will be remembered up North
as having, with his brother, run a little paper (The
Miner) on the Hodgkinson.
Broken Hill mining and tramway divs. for 1 895,
£720,000. Vic. divs., same period, £390,000. Westralian,
about £75,000, not counting disbursements of money
derived from the sale of properties.
Negotiations have been opened up for the pur-
chase of its mine from the Pinnacles Group Co. (the
leaseholder of the Pinnacles mine, now, and for years
past, held by a tribute co.), but the shareholders have
decided to hang on. The property is one of the richest
on the Barrier, but the sulphides are afflicted with the
presence of pyrrhotine or magnetic pyrites.
“A great many outlying mines are being re-
opened, the demand for sulphides being now very keen,”
says a Broken Hill wire. But though many of these out-
lying mines contain sulphides, the bodies are small; and
it takes a big lode of sulphides to pay. With their enorm-
ous bodies of stuff the Broken Hill co’s are fortunate if
they clear 15s. per ton all round.
B.H. North has its new concentrating plant
ready. It needs several things—one in particular- more
than it did a big plant.
¥ * * *
The man who, in a Sydney Sunday paper,
advises people how to speculate their half-crowns, whoops
for North Centrals (8.H.) and Junction Norths. As to
the former, we are told that “ few ventures at B. Hill
possess such chances of success,” because “ the [Broken
Hill] lode does not make its appearance on the opposite
or west side of Broken Hill. This,” it is added, “was
conclusively proved by the result of the several deep bores
put down by the Brisbane Blocks Co. and by the shaft of
the Broken Hill Extended. It is therefore confined to
three courses. It must either go down vertically, or must
stop suddenly, or it must make easterly into the North
Central mine.” But the awkward fact, so far as this
theory is concerned, is that the Block 10 Co. has got the
lode in its property at a depth of over 1000 ft., and there
it is valueless in the present state of metallurgical know-
ledge. The deduction is that, if the North Central gets
the main lode, it will be at a greater depth than 1000 ft. ;
and the ore at even 1000 ft. is no good. Moreover, the
bores and the Extended shaft didn’t prove that the lode
went down either vertically or to the east. The most
they proved was that the lode has not a rapid underlay
west. Further, if the lode underlays east, it is remark-
able that it is the ground west of the outcrop which is
breaking away on the Proprietary. However, the North
Central may have a lode : the main body is a good deal
broken on that side, and shoots run out. One such shoot
it is, probably, that the Consols worked. This improba-
bility of the existence of any considerable body of payable
ore is not, however, the principal ground of objection
to the North Central Co. Giving it the chances it
claims, the North Central is obviously a very long shot
(this Sydney writer says that if the thing collapses—well,
it’s only a matter of 3s. a share), and for all the prospect-
ing that will have to be done, the co. sets out with an
available capital of a shilling or two ! Anyway, it doesn’t
mean 3s. a share : it means call after call, with the pros-
pect of wholesale forfeitures when the shares become un-
saleable in a flat market.
The same writer says “ there is no doubt that
the Junction lode is making right into the Junction
North ;” and a 40-year miner is quoted as saying that the
“ Junction North must get the large and fine body of ore
new being worked in the Junction.” Wherefore the shares
are going to a pound. That the Junction North will get
the Junction lode is very likely ; it is quite likely, in
fact, that the co. found it years ago and didn’t know it.
What alone has to be remembered is that the Broken Hill
lode is a lenticular body, the richer ore occurring in
“ bellies,” one of which the Junction was lucky enough to
strike ; just as, long ago, Block 10 got a “ belly ” of
kaolin. Lode does not necessarily mean ore—when
will share-dabblers learn that ?
The only remaining question, in fact, is whether
the Junction lode enters the Junction North at a right or
at an acute angle. If at a right angle, then, unless it
turns, the New North cannot have it; while if at an acute
angle the Junction North cannot have much of it, but the
New North will get more of it. It might be thought that
as the lode the Junction’s western sulphide development
as it is called has been followed right up to the Junction
North boundary, little trouble would be experienced in
settling a matter of this kind; and the casual shareholding
visitor would, of course, settle it in about two minutes.
Good, practical men, however, fight over it; but the
present writer’s belief is that the Junction North’s outlook
is better than the New North’s. Meanwhile, the uncer-
tainty has led to the re-pegging of all the spare long-
thrown-up country in the neighborhood.
At the same time, seeing how speculators bite at
the North Centrals, it is proposed to again work the
Bonanza, which stands in the same geographical relation
to the British and the North as the North Central does to
the southern blocks of the Proprietary. But it is not
seriously suggested by the Bonanza people that the
big lode underlays to the east, and that the Bonanza will
get it at a depth. What is suggested is that, at Its
northern end, the big lode is broken (the new find in the
Junction supports that theory), and the Bonanza has as
good a show as any of catching a stray shoot; and so, in
fact, it has.

Melbourne speculators still have faith in the
Bingara (N.S.W.) diamonds, vide recent reconstruction of

diamond matrix in its 420 acres, and also that it will
squelch the hitherto insurmountable water difficulty by
building a huge dam. So Bingara will have another
flutter.

Faith in hydraulic-mining is eternal. The
potentialities of Shoalhaven River are again being pic-
tured with great vim, and with all the freshness of a new
field. Not the slightest allusion is made to past failures.
“ It is estimated,” says one report, “ that an expenditure
of £30,000 will be necessary before the co. will be able to
start sluicing.” The loss of over £lOO,OOO by three or
four co.’s is nothing to the new promoter—“ Why ? They
could not save the gold, and they had no one who under-
stood the great secret of modern sluicing.” The writer
once had big notions of the Shoalhaven River-drift, and
only a bitter experience satisfied him that it is all right if
it but had a little more gold. That is the chief fly in the
Shoalhaven ointment.

As far as appears from the data to hand—which
is not yet quite complete - the gold-yield of Westralia for
1895 is about 235,0000 z. This is less than one-third that of
Victoria or Queensland, a little more than half that of
N.S.W., and rather less than Maoriland; in short, it is
the smallest return among all the provinces save Tas-
mania and S. A. Tasmania produces 60,0000 z., or rather
more than one-fourth the yield of Westralia, but as it is
only one-thirty-third the size, Tasmania, judged by
results, is about eight times as good a gold-producer in
proportion to its area. The more the figures are looked
at the more utterly unaccountable is the Westralian gold-
boom. The yield of W.A. for ’95 was only about 28,0000 z.
more than that for ’94, and in the same period the N.S.W.
gold-yield increased by about 75,0000 z.; also, in the last two
years the N.S.W. yield has increased by 220,0000 z., while
that of Westralia has only gone up about 125,0000 z. Yet
no one could get up a gold-boom just now in N.S.W. for
love or money. Looked at in the light of the gold
returns, which are the only true test, and leaving out
the lying and the boom frenzy and the share-market
swindling, the result is that Westralia is the poorest gold-
mining province in Australasia bar two, and in proportion
to its size it is the poorest bar one. Also, it is no mor<;
progressive than the average, and, allowing for the dif
ference in area, the chances of the miner, reckoned ir
ounces of gold, are nearly six times as good it
N.S.W. ; eight times asgoodin Tasmania;about five times
as good in Queensland ; perhaps 20 times as good in
Victoria ; and about nine times as good in Maoriland.
Considering all the solid evidences it has produced so far
in support of its pretentions, the Westralian gold-boom is
about the most impudent fraud of the century.

prospect of a reviving boom. Will the W.A. boom revive

the expedient was adopted of defacing a penny-stamp
and giving it a face value of that sum. The information
sadly lacks detail. If it is all true it is, at any rate, to be

richness of the Maritana, particularly in view of the fall-
ing share-market and the information it has from the field
that the Maritana is a mine concerning which more boom
lies have been told than any other in the district. Which
is saying a heap, considering the number there that live,

In 44 years Bendigo has produced 12,290,0040z5.
Best year, ’53, with 661,7490z5.; worst, ’B9, with 148,7420z5.
the only year calls exceeded divs. Average yield since
’6l, well over 200,0000z5. From ’77, divs. distributed
totalled £3,780,909,' showing profit over calls of £1,379,650.
Last year there were 29 div.-paying mines, and 103 on the
call list, though nearly three-fourths managed to win a
certain amount of gold. Big callers : United Hustler’s
and Redan, £7510 16s. 6d. ; Johnson’s Reefs, £6300; New
Chum Railway (also div.-payer), £4611 ss. 6d. ; Great
Extended Hustlers, £3400 ; Confidence Extended (should
get on to the Windmill Hill run of stone this year), £3150;
Eureka Extended, £3000; South Belle Vue, £3OOO. Latter,
working on the New Chum and Devonshire line, has a
unique record for a Bendigo mine, havimr only paid its
way for two out of 30 years’ working ; fully £lOO,OOO has
been sunk in it. In ’9l it had a streak of payable stone,
which it lost; it is now trying to get on the track again.
Reefer Lansell is within some 30ft. of sinking
his 180 shaft to 3400 ft., and when completed he will open
out on the 17ft. reef cut in the 3100 ft. cross-cut early in
’95. Prospects point to the lower cross-cuts turning out
payable stone. Breaking the 180 reef will probably give
some clue as to whether, at a depth, the saddle formation
makes into a vertical reef in conformation of the theory
put forward by Pro. Nicholas some years ago.
The Lazarus, second-deepest mine at Bendigo,
is now sinking a winze on the 23ft. formation met in
cross-cutting at 3000 ft., and from the cap of which trial
crushings went about ljdwt. It is thought that this forma-
tion is a deeper one than the 180, and, If so, its profitable
development would give great impetus to Bendigo deep
mining. During ’95 the Lazarus was ’twixt and ’tween,
paying £2250 divs. and striking £1250 calls, owing to the
2000 ft. levels not maintaining their average.
Lansell took 50260 z. ldwt. out of his Comet in
’9s—milled 11,244 tons from a big run of spurs at 1100 ft.
country which Hustler’s No. 1 is trying to locate. Five
other private mines turned him in 40060 z. 17dwt. Alto-
gether the quartz-man’s yearly swag from Bendigo alone
must tread close on £70,000. His new claim at Ironbark
promises to open up a new stretch of territory, trials
proving the existence of payable dirt.
At a rough calculation, 130 tribute parties are
operating at Bendigo.
The shareholders have refused £28,000 for the
New Chum Consolidated.
First new year’s calls: Ballarat, £16,514115, Bd.;
Bendigo, £9OOO.
Omeo (Vic.) ’95 gold output—2o,oB6oz. Last
quarter’s (68630 z. from quartz, and 680 oz. alluvial) the
record. A field with a big future.
Vic.’s tribute system badly needs adjustment.
Some mining co’s vie with the cruellest usurer in extract-
ing centage. For instance, at Steiglitz tributes average 50
percent., and in one mine the party pays 60 per cent.,
besides finding small etceteras usually provided by the co.
At these terms what chance has the tributor of making a
living wage out of ground discarded by a co. as unprofit-
able? Aiso, owing to the insecurity of tenure, directly
he strikes a good, payable run the co. practically thie. es
it from him by instantly shutting down on the agree-
ment.
* * * *
Vic.’s drop: Co. divs. in ’9l, £2,567,740; ’95,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Premier Nelson was out West on
his recent tour, he, Mines Minister Philp, and
Corfield, M.L.A., were invited to lunch at a cer-
tain station, one of the proprietors whereof acted
as host. In the Premier’s party were Dutton (his
private secretary), and Knight, the Courier re-
presentative. The host talks in the “ haw, haw ”
dialect, and would be easily reconciled to the
death of art and learning, laws and commerce, if
our old nobility—and squatters—were only left as
full compensation. This blue-blooded scion of
ultra-Jumbuckism sent Dutton and Knight to
dine by themselves in an old building, with two
chairs and an improvised table decorated with a
mutton-bone and a bottle containing two carefully-
measured nips of whisky. “ Have something to
drink ! ” said the menial who accompanied them.
Both guests, with severe emphasis and studied'
politeness, promptly declined tiie two solitary nips
and a banquet on the mutton-bone ! They preferred
to fast and pray for traveller's whom inauspicious
fate sent to any station homestead cursed with
“ Hielan’ pride and hunger.” A grim smile sat on
the face of the newspaper man as he wrote an
account of the visit to that station and referred to
rhe proprietor-host as “ the person in charge ! ”

A well-known eccentric Brisbane character
who regards himself as the Messiah, and accents
all his words on every syllable, was listening to a
sermon preached by the Rev. Sutherland in Bowen
Hills Congregational Church. Sutherland re-
ferred to “Christ the Son of God,” when the
Messiah rose and said, “ In truth thou art a damn-
able liar, for I am the true and only King of
Israel, prince of the House of David !” The con-
gregation sat up. The preacher observed, “If
some one does not put that person out I must
come down and do it myself.” The Da vidian
prince thereupon shook his stick and remarked,
“If thou dost, thou damnable Devil, I shall
resist thee !” The congregation felt so bad they
had to hold on to one anomer to avoid falling on
the floor.
* * * *
The “ Messiah s ” boric ran in a small
paddock surrounded by houses. After catching
the sacred steed, he proceeded, regardless of spec-
tators, to remove his pants, turn them inside-out,
mount his bareback charger, and ride to the stable.
He did this on the score of economy. It served
also as a daily comedy for a large and enthusiastic
audience of neighbours.
* * * *
On one occasion he start M to expostulate
with a robust fisherwoman on Sandgate pier.
Roused by some apparently opprobrious epithet,
the bold fisherwoman floored the son of David
with a flush hit on the nose. While lying on his
back he called to the spectators to ‘ ‘ come and see
the Lord of Israel prostrate before a daughter of
Belial.” The bold fisherwoman, regarding this
last remark as an imputation on her parents, hit
him with a 41b. mullet and left.

At Dunvvich Benevolent Asylum, on Strad-
broke Island, in Moreton Bay, there are now 800
aged human male and female wrecks stranded on
“ Charity Beach.” Heavens ! What a volume
some of their biographies would make! The
Superintendent, Dr. B. Smith, is a Caledonian/
from Aberdeenshire, and tracks of Caledonian
humor are found all over the premises. There is a
“snoring ward,” where all the old fossils with
trombone nasal organs are sent to sleep o’ nights.
Between each two snorers is a deaf man whose
ears would record no sound except that of the trump
of doom. He also acts as a buffer when the snorers
kick at each other with a request to 1 ‘ turn off that
7 foghorn ! ” The doctor has a seismograph
in his office 100 yards away, and this instrument
registers the terranean tremors from the snoring
ward so accurately that he can tell when all the
snorers are asleep. This last item was communi-
cated by an old timber-getter inmate who proudly
claims to be the most accomplished liar on the
premises.
* * * *
Near the asylum is the cemetery where
half-a-dozen fresh graves are always ready. The
old fellows lean over the fence and speculate on
the site of the vacancy they are likely to occupy.
There is also a “graveyard consultation” among
them, and the one who draws the first man to die
wins the prize. This is carrying the ruling passion
to the last extremity. There was great excite-
ment recently over the prize falling to a ticket-
holder who had drawn a man unexpectedly killed
three days afterwards by a cow that was landed
on the jetty from the Government steamer.
Those who held tickets with the names of patients
expected to start first for the cemetery, protested
against “ death by the visitation of a cow” as an
infringement of the rights of Providence and a
violation of the principle of the consultation.
After the money was paid over someone called for
“ three curses for the cow ! ”

When W. O. Hodgkinson was out across
Australia with M‘Kinlay in ’62 he was supposed
to be the scientific man of the expedition. There
was no science about M‘Kinlay. He had packed
the scientific instruments with the groceries and
the tinned beef. When 70 miles from Lake Hodg-
kinson (“ Guappanbarra ”), M‘Kinlay suggested
that W.O.H. should ascertain where they were.
The instruments were unpacked, and, naturally
enough, were not in first-class order. After taking
observations, W.O.H. calmly remarked: “We
are now 12 miles East of Bangkok, the capital of
Siam!” “ What the blazes do you mean?” said
M'Kinlay ; “ have you gone mad ?” Hodgkinson
sternly asked—“ Are you the scientist of this
expedition, or am I?” M‘K inlay requested
Middleton to take a fresh series of observations.
The result was to locate their position four miles
from Christchurch in Maoriland. Then M‘Kinlay
sat down on a boulder and referred in blasphemous
terms to the evil fate that sent him cavorting
across the continent of Australia in the company
of a band of lunatics.

Did you ever publish that epigram on Hori
Grey when he was Governor at Cape Town and
the people rose in a body and refused to allow the
convicts to land ? If not, here it is :

The Hottentots declared that he was white,
The Dutchmen swore that he was black as night;

It is related of a certain Queensland
M.L.A., who poses as an authority on farming,
that his agricultural experience mainly consisted
of growing arrowroot on a poor farm where he
employed German newchums, whom he fed exten-
sively on arrowroot and sweet potatoes. They got
so saturated with starch that they had to be
dipped in a lagoon every day to take the stiffness
out of them.

The Aubigny electors had met to consult
about a representative. Littleton, a brother-in-
law of Groom, was the speaker, and Dempsey, an
intending candidate, was present. Littleton
described his ideal of what a member ought to be,
and “ above all we want no crawler.” Dempsey
rose. “Oi hope the gintleman doant allood to me
as a crawler! Yez’ll all renumber -that when
Misther Pathrick Purkins shtud for this elictorate
that whin Oi wiz prisint at the mating and they
putt me out at the dure that Oi come back agin in
troo the windie ; an’ yez wouldn’t call that a
crawler ! ”

The squatter’s brother from England
had been a month on the station. He wanted a
horse, and hailed “Minjan,” the blackboy. “ Will
you—ah—kindly bring up my —ah—horse, and
I will suitably reward you with —ah—a piece
of tobaccah.” Minjan went to Bill Terry, the
stockman, and remarked : “ Me been tinkum dat
fella new-chum plurry fool, whaffor thaffella baal
yabba Inglith langwich ? ”
* * * *
A swell new-chum came out to Carpendale
and Varmeclc’s station for experience. He was
sent one day in a spring-cart to a neighboring run
and had to cross a big flat. “You might have a
kangaroo-hunt on the way,” was Varmeck’s last
sentence. Crossing the flat he started two old
man kangaroos and at once gave furious chase—in
the spring-cart.

\\ hen old Pat C , of , was made
a Jay-Pay, he believed himself but a very little
lower than the,angels, or even Queen Victoria.
On the following day he was milking a cow called
Biddy, an intelligent, proud, and well-connected
moo-inoo that marked her disapproval of her
master’s appointment by abruptly shifting him
about 3yds. with a turn of her off-hind leg. Pat
arose from the mud, and hit the milker over the
head with the pail, with, ‘ ‘ Hell to your sowl,
Biddy ! wud yez darr to kick his Worship ? ”
* * * *
And when Pat D , of Station, was
made a magistrate, his wife sent over to ask the
wife of a neighboring squatter “what relation is
Mr. D to the Queen ? ” Her idea was that a
J.P. stood next to the throne. One day Pat had
a bare-hand controversy with one of his men and
came off with a long balance on the wrong side,
whereupon Ins loving spouse: “Send for the police,
Patsy, and have him hanged, for a magistrate can
do anything!”

Through the sombre theological warp of
Prior Vaughan there runs a colored thread of
humor. The genial Prior strolled into Tattersall’s
office in Brisbane and bought two consultation
tickets during the time Byrnes’s Anti-Gambling
Bill was being discussed in the Assembly. As he
folded the tickets and placed them in his sacer-
dotal pocket he observed : “ I am going to dine
to-night at Parliament House with Byrnes and
Thynne, and intend to see that this gambling
business is all stopped in this colony.” Then he
gave a subdued cough and an apostolic wink and
departed to dine.

Lady Bowen once missed a gold watch and
chain, and the servants at Government House
were under unpleasant suspicion until a tame emu,
a week afterwards, deposited the lost, jewellery in
the middle of the yard. The butler picked it up
with a pair of tongs. The watch recorded its own
fate, having appropriately stopped at ate o’clock.

A Queensland jury recently acquitted a
man charged with burglary, though the evidence
was enough to hang a vestal virgin. The Judge
said: “Prisoner, the jury have decided that you
are innocent, evidently regarding you as the
victim of coincidences hitherto unprecedented and
probably never hereafter to be paralleled. lam
pleased to hear that you are innocent, and also of
your intention to leave the country. You
are discharged ! ’ This is equalled by Judge
O’Grady, at the Cork Assizes. The jury acquitted
two notorious highwaymen. O’Grady observed —
“ Prisoners ! these twelve intelligent, good men
have pronounced you innocent, and I have there-
fore only to discharge you, but I shall instruct the
gaoler to detain you two respectable gentlemen for
a couple of hours, as I am leaving for Dublin at
6 o’clock and would like a fair start.”

If Caesar had not deferred reading the
letter of Artemidorus, and the Theban archons
postponed perusal of the note from the High
Priest, their fates would have been different; and
if a prominent Queensland politician had not,
during the last week of the session, put a letter
in his pocket and forgotten it for two days, there
would probably have been a sensational tragedy
and a vacancy in the Cabinet.

In the Norse mythology there is mention
of the god Heimdal, who was the son of nine
virgins. His eyes were so sharp he could see a
thousand miles in all directions, and his ears so
keen he could hear grass and wool growing from
the ground and the sheeps’ backs. This "is the
person required to preside over the next Queens-
land general election. The systematic manipula-
tion of the rolls, and so-called “purification,” has
established a basis for possibilities not pleasant to
contemplate.

A recent writer on Australian aborigines
refers to “ bushmen’s unveracious stories of a
hairless ti-ibe.” And yet there are still some sur-
vivors of the famous hairless tribe near St. George,
on the Balonne, and in the Sydney Herald of
20th Feb., 1802, there is an account of one of this
tribe taken to Sydney by D. F. Mackie, brother
of the present Robert Mackie, of Fairymeadow
station, on the Condamine. This Balonne tribe
was absolutely destitute of every sign of hair on
head, armpits, or body. 1 saw two of them at St.
George in 1875.

important notice to cigarette smokers.
Tl/ E beg to inform our customers and cigarette sin-.kers generally that the American To’oacco Co.,
7 ▼ , Dtd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginters Straight-out No. 1,” “ Cameo ” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
THREE CASTLES ” and CAAIPST-A-lEsIV 5
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills* “Three Castles’* and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

Much has been said of late about peculiar
burial customs among Australian aborigines. On
the Solomons, porpoise and shark skins are stuffed
by the islanders with the bones of eminent Poly-
nesians. Monaugi, in the same group, is an island
of the dead. 1 he bodies are carried to the top of
a high peak, ex posed, and allowed to decompose
there. In the forres group, the same custom
prevails. C onipare the Parsec habit of allowing

Prof. Morris, of Melb. University, is at
work on A Dictionary of Australasian English.”
He asserts that “gone bun v ’ is from an aborigi-
nal word “bong” (dead), and “billabong”
means dead water.” “Bandicoot” is really a
Telugu(India) word meaning “pig-rat.” “Wattle”
is from an old English word meaning “ a twig or
switch, and the tree got its name from the
branches being used as “wattles” in making
‘wattle and dab ” houses. “ Kangaroo ” is, after
all, the Endeavour River blacks’ name for the
animal, and does not mean “J don’t understand.”
W arrigal was originally the name for a wild
dog, afterwards for a wild liorse, later for a wild
blackfellow, and finally for anything wild and
worthless. “ Picaninny ” is really a West Indian
word for a nigger baby. “Brumby,” he cannot
trace to its source. “ Waddy ” is simply a black’s
bad shot at English “wood.” “ Jabber” is
English “jabber. “Tea-tree” is the proper
spelling, not ti-tree, the earliest settlers having
made tea of a kind from its leaves. Maiden, of
Sydney, in his “Native Plants,” says it was
“ utilised by Captain Cook’s crews for making tea.
It is exceedingly common round Sydney, so large
quantities would therefore be available for the
sailors." Apparently he forgets that Captain
Cook had omy one ship, and therefore only one
crew. The mopoke of Maoriland is an owl, [A'inox
boo-book) ; the Australian mopoke is the oodanjus ;
moreover, it should never be spelt “morepork. ”
Larrikin is derived, not from Sergeant Dalton’s
brogue, but from London thieves" slang, and is
short for “ leary kinchin.” “Barrack” is, how-
sver, Irish for “bark.” Wallaby and Wallaroo
are from a root “ wall, ” meaning kangaroo in some
dialects.

The Silverton India Rubba, Gutta Percha
and Telegraph Works Co., of 238 George-street,
Sydney, has a stock this year and a programme
which will make the business hum. Rubber
goods, engineer’s lines, cycling goods, pneumatic
tires, golf balls, &c., &c., are either unnumbered
or numbered by the legion. A speciality is the
Silverton Grip Armored Hose, which lasts twice
the time of ordinary hose. There’s enough of this
precious hose in stock to girdle the earth some
scores of times, and if this were done our planet
could be put out by laying on the hose from the
oceans when the said planet falls into Sheol as it
did on hell-fire Monday. The firm has tennis-
racquets and balls of its own make to please the
New Woman with, and tons of sheet rubber for
valves. Divers’ dresses and appliances are a large
stock, and on these there has lately been an
astonishing run—probably from the fact that a
good many people intend spending the present
summer under the harbor.*

Brilliant and St. George, Charters Towers, has
declared its 32nd div. of Is. (£7200), payable 22nd Jan.
Local quotation for shares on date of declaration of div.
from 355. to 40s. For less than a week, about the same
time, 300 tons of quartz were hauled. Below everything
looks rosy, except in the No. 5 East level, where the stone
has pinched.
The Golden Gate mine, Towers, is owned by
an English co. It was sud to be worked out, and a
diamond-drill bore ha , i r some time past, been going
down to test the lease. There seems to be gold some-
where in the old workings, however, as a party of tribu-
tors during the first week of the current year put through
18 tons of stone for 114 oz. smelted gold.
Brilliant Extended block, Charters Towers, has
its reconstruction signals flying. An extraordinary
meeting has been called to consider the best means of
raising capital, and it is likely the public will now be
invited to come in. Hitherto the mine has been prac-
tically owned by a party of three, whose outlay must
have totted up a large sum.
During Dec., Mills United, Charters Towers,
crushed at the Burdekin mill 1096 tons for 7590 z. lSdwt.
A tremendous come-down for the one-time Northern
show-mine, which, not long ago, used to keep the best
part of the three biggest mills on the field fully employed.
At the Syndicate mill, 570 tons were crushed for 36i0z.,
but crushing for Mills United there has now ceased.
Brilliant Block, Towers, crushed, during Deo.,
1850 tons for 1194j0z. The co’s big mill, with steam
tramway from the mine, is approaching completion.
The mining outlook at the Towers for ’96 is
very promising. Without looking forward to any sen-
sational developments, yields and profits equal to last
year are fully anticipated.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Newmarket and Australian Cup lists dis-
close a irreat many “ old familiars ” that have time and
oft broken punters’ hearts, with an added few of unknown
calibre introduced by way of variety. Though there are
a number of good ’uns in M.L., the customary batch from
that quarter is missing, and owing to a variety of other
causes the 90 in the short race falls below last year's total
by 17, and the Cup list is only 30 against last year’s 38. A
perusal of the lists reveals the presence of a few good’uns,
a number of moderates, and a mighty lot of trash. Hova
is undoubtedly the best horse nominated. He is in both
events, and Cook’s old favorite, The Admiral, and dotty
Patron are entered as usual. The surprise of the Cup is
the absence of Auraria, said by-daily writers to be kept
specially for the Champion Stakes to meet the highly-
improved Wallace. But her appearance in the autumn is
problematical ; her legs have been giving her trainer no
end of trouble. Such being the case, the great battle of
the new year may not eventuate. Wallace figures in the
Cup, but may be reserved for the Champion, his owner
having other healthy-looking reps, in Havoc, Nada, Brad-
ford, and Trentham.
Contrary to expectations, also, Hopscotch wasn’t
entered for Newmarket, a much-required spell being the
cause. Atlas, Delaware and Trenchant are necessarily
missing; but N.S.W. is well represented in ’noth events.
Mahee, Acmena, Fort, Toreador, Quiver, the once pro-
mising Chesterman, the maiden Ronda and others are
the long-distance aspirants; and Vanitas, the cast-iron-
legged Whakawatea, Cravat and co. are in for the sprint.
S. A. furnishes but two entries, one of them, Foliage, being
a slippery three-year-old. At the recent S.A.J.C. meet,
after losing a 1£ mile event through injudicious riding he
hopped over the six-furlongs with Bst. 51b.', beating 17
others, in 1.155, winning in a canter.

2—BOY: “ What's that you said, mister?"
JONES: "Why — er—I— er—said that you must be careful, and not let
that turkey drop."
The vast Australian punting throng is now
busying itself trying to pick the long-shot double, New-
market Handicap and Australian Cup. Straight-out
wagering is, of course, out of the question, cash being
miserably scarce, and Ikey M. so liberal with his Autumn
odds ! But the little double suits both Ikey and the
gigantic unlimited liability co. of mugs who support him,
so the happy give-and-take business will paddle along
harmoniously until settling day, when the giver will be
the taker.
Following the example of the Melb. Metro-
politan Club, the V.A.T.C. committee rejected a proposal
to discountenance two-year-old racing in Aug. and Sept.
The matter was more fully thrashed out than at the
V.R.C., but the same objection (detrimental to the horse-
breeding industry) was advanced and prevailed. How-
ever, this probably was not the real reason. Unanimity
in so important a matter is most desirable. The subject
won’t be allowed to rest, though, as a general meeting of
the V.R.O. is to be asked to decide the point. Early
racing undoubtedly spoils the racehorse.

Mahee is a badly-treated horse in both the
Sydney Turf Club’s Challenge Stakes and Anniversary
Handicap. With 21bs. under lOst. he hasn’t a possible
show in the six-furlong event, in which Whakawatea,
Buccleugh, Aurea, Response and Collarette appear to
have undoubted chances. Patrona, too, may prove a
good speculation, merely on account of her light 6.11,
and relationship to Patron. In the Anniversary Handi-
cap, Patroness, sister to the pair, isn’t overburdened with
8.5, Jack o’ Lantern has a chance with 8.3, but the picks
of the entrants appear to be Response (7.7) and Scotch
Lassie (6.7). But the Challenge Stakes will probably be a
practically “ dead ” field, in view of the more important
Vic. Newmarket Handicap. *

The so-called jockeys’ ring on Melb. suburban

ABui.LETTNcorrespondent: “If the Metropolitan
clubs decreed that no cup or big handicap horse could be
scratched within a week of the race or at the “eleventh

But what entertaining reading some of those excuses

An old Maoriland racing man’s story:—“ I
attended a back-blocks meeting once. Regular bush
affair. Unfenced track, no grand-stand, and it rained all
day. Protests for running inside flags, etc., were so
numerous that the last race arrived at dusk. It was a
post-entry hurry-skurry, and a dozen went out, three or
four not being backed at all, including a bottled-up
certainty named Flatfoot. At the last moment the owner
put on a tenner for himself and a fiver for the jock. The
boy, however, was too anxious; got fined for breaking
away, and when the flag flell was left standing stock still
at the post. But he didn’t lose his head. Taking advan-
tage of the darkness he cut across the paddock, joined the
field at the turn and won anyhow. Totalisator yield,
6150. The judge had an inkling of what occurred, but
didn’t say anything. Afterwards that jock told me all
about it. Why did he tell me ? Well, y’see, I was the
owner! And why did the judge keep his mouth shut?
Well, I was the judge too, seel”

That match, cyclist Harris v. trotter Mystery

After carefully pricking the card, a well-in-

impossible for the selectors of the ’Ome team to pick a

mises of moderation are right enough in their way but
the Great Australian Thirst is bound to take passage 'Ome
in the same boat, and shine out conspicuously when the
glass rises and the water’s bad. If it can be left behind
on the wharf, so much the better, but even then it will
probably take the next steamer, or get ’Ome by cable
immediately on receipt of the news of the first victory

in Melbourne was no fluke. Donnan, although l he bu
such an uglv style, repeated his Me b. H< un 'pn.
M'Kibbin showed that he is a first-class bowler.
Vntfiner was terrible. G. Giffen was lucky in not malting
a duck’each innings, as Kelly dropped Aust
N.S.W. 74 runs. Darling was nervous,,°'V Hill wm over-
Eleven prospects at stake, and Cle .
weighted, taking nearly an hour to make fi runa. The
match will have great influence on the picking ot tne
team for England. Clem Hill and V.'n h£d
weakened their chances. Jones is now a certainty. J 1 1 naa
Jones in Sydney I would not be afraid to P. ,a >' a i Fnldfs’h
said Garrett, “he is the first man to be picked for Englis
wickets.” Garrett, by the way, is a popular Adelaide tfiP
for captain, and on his form he is well worth his place as
a batsman. Lyons has improved his chances consider-
ably. He batted better than any other P lay ? r .
each innings. Iredale will probably find that his 6 2 has
secured him a trip, as his chances depended greatb upon
Darling;, and it is hard to see how Donnan and M Kibbin
can be ignored.
Garrett and Giffen (who with Bruce will pick
the Australian Eleven) when in Adelaide agreed that the
great trouble will be in choosing first wicketkeeper.
Lewis was regarded as a certainty until his Melb. failure,
Jarvis is getting old, and is only a shadow of his former
self, and there may be other reasons against him , ana
Kelly, although he performed splendidly against s.A., is
hardly class enough. Bruce is reported to favor Johns,
the Melb. University keepc-, who did well against
England. Garrett is uncertain, but will probably vote
for Kelly, but Giffen favors Jack M'Kenzie, the Norwood
(S.A.) club wicketkeeper, who has been playing in outside
cricket this year, but has rejoined the Norwoods.
M'Kenzie is a splendid man, who, had he gone to Sydney
years ago, would have been first wicketkeepei in Aus-
tralia to-day. But Kelly is a batsman, whereas M'Kenzie
is not.
Giffen lost the toss in every match S.A. played
last year, and he has lost it on both occasions this season.
He, however, won the toss four times out of five when
captaining Australia against England.
Ernest Jones, the S.A. lightning bowler, who
took seven N.S.W. wickets for 112 runs for S.A. last week,
is a born athlete. He was known as an excellent bowler
and a good footballer 10 years ago, when he played at
Crystal Brook (S.A.). From there he migrated to Broken
Hill, and on the dangerous wickets in the early days was
a terror. Jones went to Adelaide in '93 to play football
for S. Adelaide and proved a wonder, but it was as
a cricketer he made a sensation. His bowling was at first
almost unplayable, but Adelaide cricketers got used to
him, and he fell off temporarily. But Jones has learnt a
lot lately, and he now moderates his pace and gets a
better pitch. He is a champion runner, has won many
prizes for different feats of strength, and is undoubtedly
one of the best of fieldsmen.

The N.S.W. team which visited M.L. beat
Canterbury, Otago, and Wellington, but was beaten by

features of the tour; Poidevin put up 64 in fine style
against Canterbury ; 48 against Otago; 54 (top score) in
the first innings against all M.L., and 38 (top score) in the
second innings. Poidevin is 18 years old, and a N.S.W
State-school pupil teacher.

The well-known Misfit Parlor of Mr.
Nathan Herman, established for 20 years, at 0
Wynyard Square, Sydney, is now attracting more
than the ordinary crowd of customers. One line
that is contributing specially to the growth of
business is the bale system. For £2, a whole bale
of men’s useful clothing, boots, &c., can be got.
These parcels are sent by rail or steamer, free of
charge, to any part of the province. There are bar-
gains to be had all through the establishment. A
half-chest of tea, weighing nearly 401b., can be
purchased for £1 10s., and a 121b. tin for 10s.
When a watch and chain—the timekeeper being
guaranteed—can be had for as small a sum as 7s.
6d., hardly a schoolboy will go without those
articles. The watches are valued at =£1 5s., and
are despatched post-free. Brussels carpets, in the
latest designs, are offered at 2s. per yard, and the
material is valued at nearly three times the price.
All the carpeting, linoleums, and floorcloths will
be laid, free of charge, by a competent staff.
Smokers can get tobacco at 3d. per plug ? and
choice Havana cigars at 6s. per box of 50, being at
the rate of under per cigar. Mr. Herman is
constantly in receipt of letters acknowledging the
great bargains his customers have made. The
suit a Gowra man got in his £2 bale, together with
a large number of articles of wearing apparel, he
said was worth at least £4. From Bathurst, a
man wrote stating he reckoned the tea he had got
at a cost of about lOd. was worth 2s. per lb. #

Zimmerman, is by birth a Canadian. So far, Parsons is
the only Australian who has taken down the champion.
Sydney League of Wheelmen, having fallen out
with Sydney Cricket-ground trustees because of the 20
per cent, charged by the trustees on the gate, will
not now entice the Ground people to lay down that
hanked A 1 track. The League can’t see further ahead
than its nose. Had it given the trustees their wav till
the track was down the trustees might have listened to
reason, hut now they are hopelessly “ fly.” The Leasrue
was charged the percentage which is charged En-dish
cricket teams ; and where do the League’s expenses be ,r in
when compared with said teams? No hotel or travelling
exes.; no amateurs piling up hills at the most fashionable
hotels ; no W. G Grace to mop up £3OOO “ on his own.”
Why didn t the League shut its head and keep its hat on
and go straight for the track and cash ? With a hit of a
screw on the Ground crowd the League could have piled
up money, for, as Zimmerman and every other enlightened
person says, the Sydney Cricket-ground is about the best
lhow-ground in the world.
* * * *
D. J. Walker, one of Zim’s conquerors, is clerk
and salesman in the Raleigh Cycle Agency, Melb. He is
one of the most of brilliant sprinters, hut he rarely reaches
form in racing. How he was mesmerised sufficiently to
forget he was racing and to heat Zim. is a mystery,
D.J.W. is a tall, good-looking hoy with curly hair, and
many feminine admirers. His trainer is Billy Williams
the Melb. boxer.
* * « *
Although the new N.S.W. tariff takes 10 per
cent, off cycles, the Sydney firms practically adhere to
old prices. Shows what money is in the cycle business,
and how rival firms compete wisely in each other’s
interest.
* * * *
Megson, his friends say, is getting so well that
ne’ll yet shake up the best of them this season. But
Payne is the N.S.W. cyclist who is promising to do big
things.
* * * *
The big prize, <£2so, in the Two-mile Wheel
Race at A.N.A. sports, on 27th Jan., should show the
real form of Scharp, Matthews, and George Irish. Irish,
son of a noted athlete, had typhoid some 1C months ago,
and has been lving low ever since.
* * * *
W. L. Kerr, as pointed out hei’ein some time
hack, was saving himself for the M.L. trip. At the
Christchurch sports he won the half-mile, mile, and five-
mile cycling championships.

Pither and Walker, Zim.’s victors, are given
respectively 30 and 40 yds. start of Harris and Martin
(hotli scratch) in the A.M.A. £3OO two-mile wheel-race.
Parsons is on the same mark as Payne, Megson and
Pither.
* * * *
While “ A-a-rthur ” is training on St. Kilda
crack of an evening, Mrs. Zimmerman, who invariably
accompanies him, hangs about the gate drawing
geometrical figures in the dust with her parasol and tap-
ping her tiny bott.iries on the ground with evident im-
patience—to which fact lias been ascribed the secret of
Zimmie’s wonderful pace. “No wonder he turns off miles
in 1.57,” remarked a bystander glancing at the lady the
other evening ; “ Zimmy’l! get his hair pulled if he keeps
her waiting much longer.” But Arthur doesn’t look very
henpecked, he and his wife being inseparable and almost
every evening to be seen on the local esplanade. Mrs. Z.
is a handsome girl of unmistakeably Yankee type, and
quite eclipses her hubby in public interest wtien they
appear together
* * * *
So far, Zimmerman has not ridden on the road.
“Cycling is my business,” he explains; “if the public
want to see me they can pay at the gate.” But it is a
guinea to a gooseberry that none of the public would ever
guess that the very ordinary-looking novice that the great
man looks was the great Z. himself.

Not long ago in Australia, after two pugs had
fought for “ the ’ouse,” the boss thereof proceeded to
divide the money as it lay upon the table. He began
counting out upon the table ; the two pugs sitting close
by in expectant silence. “One! two! three! four!
What are you making such a deuce of a row for?” and he
swept the sovereigns back into the heap. The boss started
again—“ One ! two ! three ! four ! Damn it, , why
d-o-nt you shut your head and let me count?” Again
the sovs. were swept hack into the heap. “ One ! two 1
three ! four! Oh, hang it all, if both of you won’t let
me count past four, here’s four each for you.” And
giving the bewildered pair four sovs. each, the boss swept
the big money into Ins pocket.

Tom Mead ham, of Sydney, who is challenging
Placke, the Oft. 5t in. Dutchman, is 22 years old, barely
6ft. high, and weighs 1741 b. in condition. Previous to
Issuing the three-mile challenge to Placke, he had never
raced more than 1000 yards. He offered to stake £75
against Plaeke’s £5O, but Placke wouldn’t come then.
Placke seems to have not yet recovered from his
fight with Barker. He now talks of going to America and
deluded man !-challenging the world under Queens-
berry rules.
* * * *
Tom Meadham, Placke’s challenger, is a native
of Clermont, Q. He swam 100yds. with several turns, in
lmin. at Sydney Natatorium; Tyer’s record is liuin.
2 l-ssee., but lie gained it with fewer turns. Meadham I
has also done 78 yards in4Ssec., as against Tver’s 49 3-ssee.;
but the same question of turns conies in again. Meadham
has been racing some five years ; he learned to swim just
before or after he learned to walk.

A Johannesburg journal devotes seven columns
to the Goddard-Ryan fight. Goddard undertook to stand
up 35 rounds, hut things got so warm that the police
stepped in. After separation, Ryan rushed at his oppo-
nent saying*, “ You know I had you beat, you .
Then they started again, and fought till parted. The
crowd seemed to favor Ryan, and called him after the
referee declared a draw. Goddard appeared and was
hooted, whereupon he spread-eagled his fingers on his
nose. Door takings, £2072 !

Even after the great fiasco, Corbett was ap-
proached with a view to a fight with Fitz., but refused.
“I don’t care a jot for public criticism,’ said J.J. 111
simply retire. Thev sav that when I whipped Sullivan
I heat an old man, and that I never whipped a good man
m my career. However, I’m fully determined to quit-
j T.j Can I,ave the championship. He’s an Irishman,
and I d sooner he’d defend the title than an Englisher or
a lanky Australian.”
* * * *
Corbett’s opinion Maher is boss of the boxing
world, and can easily whip Fitzsimmons. On the other
hand, Fitz. says he is able to reduce the Irishman to pulp.
According to Fitzsimmons, when Madden first
Maher to ’Murka, Corbett begged Madden not to
challenge him on behalf of Maher. The reason was that
Maher was an Irishman, and he (Corbett) a Yank. The
English and Australian don’t count for anything among
the boxing brotherhood.
SAW MUCH OF HER .
MISS JOHNSON : “Did you see much of Miss Dasher at Sorrento?”
B ROWN: “ Well, I should say I did. She 'wore her bathing-suit in the morning,
bloomers in the afternoon, and low neck at night.”
Martin Julian, Fitzsimmons’ manager, ean blow
and bluff as well as anyone else. He recently said the
lanky one claimed both the middle and heavy-weight
championships, and was ready to defend either for 5000 to
10,000 dols., first come first served. He would batter
Maher or any other white man, and if blustering-Corbett
wouldn’t don the mits he could select the referee, and
Fitz. would sign the articles blindfolded. Corbett, he
said, was too "faint-hearted to meet a man of the Aus-
tralian’s calibre in “ a fair and square fight where crooked-
ness and put-up jobs aren’t tolerated.”

Modern pugilism seems to have a tendency to
develop the lungs.

Prof. Morris must have been extremely lazy in
his search re the history of the word “barrack” when
he can trace it back no more than 12 years. The present
writer distinctly remembers being asked its origin at a
football match 14 years ago by a clever Glasgow graduate,
and at that time it had been several years (seven or eight
at least) in general use. Has the origin of “barrack’
anythin"- to do with the moral support given by members
of the same regiment to those of their fellows competing
against members of other regiments in sports, assaults-at-
arms, &e. ?

When Parsons’ defeat of Zimmerman was
cabled ’Ome, Barden wrote to London Sportsman challeng-
ing the victor, and forwarded a deposit to bind a possible
match. * , *

Barker received 50s. for bashing Placke, and
Placke got £l4 out of the benefit given him on his return
from the jaw 3 of death.
• * *
Should a match come on, Tom Meadham (who,
bv the way, is a good boxer as well as swimmer), thinks
Placke is his. - Placke, so the experts say, swims dead
slow, but could swim for a week. Meadham will keep
with Placke the whole way and trust to the final 100yds.

Probably the most symmetrically-built athlete
is the Ded Marsh, the present Australian champion, is
an aboriginal and a model. Pugs are often good above
the waist, but somewhat “left in the matter of legs.
The cyclist is noted for big thighs a x n , c \, s ™ a ' n ®, ss

/Vic > Davis and Tom Busst (S.A.). Not that- cycling
alwavs develops these peculiarities, but that that type of

for developing anything except the cash-amateur and ms

c Memmotfc, the Australian cueist, makes a
noor’show at the‘Murkan cannon game. Matched with
Carter, the Yankee champion, recently, 1000 cannons up
he received a handicap of 750 cannons, and only added 60
to his score when the Yank was cut. Carter made one
break of 563 cannons.
Chester, England, has the champion
family, the Ogdens. A police-officer lately told
the bench that Pa Ogden had been up 35 times,
the son 130 times, Miss Ogden G 7 times, and Miss
J. Ogden 29 times.
Spagnoletti : “Mettemich lies and de-
ceives, Talleyrand lies, but deceives nobody.”
Thus a bitter enemy of the latter. British
diplomacy is that way, as pointed out by Goldwin
Smith, 35 years ago, in his book on The Empire.
“ The English forte is bullying, not lying.”
N.S.W. Pre-
mier Reicl has
sent a supremely
foolish cablegram
to England an-
nouncing that all
these provinces—
except Maorilanu
—deeply sympa-
thise with Salis-
bury in his efforts
to maintain “the
integrity of the
British Empire,”
and will give
Britain their loyal
support. It is
for the people to
decide, per me-
dium of Parlia-
ment, whether
they will give
“support” in any
British ructions,
and no one fat
man with an eye-
glass has a right
to speak on their
behalf in this
fashion. The
Bulletin has just
as much right to
cable home that
G. Reid will come
along and do up
Salisbury’s front
garden and empty
the back-yard ash-
barrel.
“The children
of this genera-
tion.” Justice
Windeyer’s letter
to N.S.W. Go-
vernment request-
ed merely a six
months’ leave of
absence. At the
end of that period
he can, and pos-
sibly will, like
brother Stephen,
el alii, apply for
another 6 months’
leave. Had he
applied for 12
months’ leave at
once he would
have been entitled
to full pay for
only the first six ;
whereas, by mak-
ing a fresh appli-
cation at the end
of six months, he
could, according
to precedent, en-
title himself to
full pay for the
second six also.
Further, by re-
taining a seat on
the Bench even
nominally he con-
tinues to hold the powers of a Supreme Court
Judge in matters of contempt. To resign
at once is, anyhow, foreign to a mind like
Windeyer’s ; and to resign in six months is nearly
as foreign.
“ Nature is Sin and Mind is Devil.”
“Knickerbockers! And why not? I
have a perfect right.” “And the left,” one
asked hesitatingly. But she preserved a dignified
silence and chose to regard the question as a rude
personality.
Apropos the Laureateship, Oscar Wilde
once wrote: —“ Mr. Swinburne is already the
Poet Laureate of England. The fact that his ap-
pointment to this high post has not been degraded
by official confirmation renders his position ali the
more unassailable. He whom all poets love is the
Laureate Poet always.”

New Zealand, writes:
“About ten years ago, while engager! m

and my leg was fractured below the knee.
It healed in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and have been
obliged, at times, to wear a bandage. About

a year ago it became much worse, and I

not been troubled with it since.”

“ Brumby’s Run ” has been getting some-
what thickly populated of late in Southern
Queensland. 3000 wild horses were shot last year
on one station and 400 skins shipped to Sydney.
The wild horses are a perfect curse to station stock,
and simply ruin a property in drought time.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
The mild cheerfulness of John O’Hara’s j
“Songs of the South ” (second series), seems to be :
commending the South Melbourne bard to kindly '
notice, and his book is in some demand. O’Hara’s
tuneful addresses to Earth, Heaven,’wind, water,
Captain Cook, W. J. Meaden, and many other
things, small or great, can’t be said to fill a long-
felt want, but they are at least free from “weird
melancholy.” He writes with a light hand and
an Irish heart, and he dedicates his verses to
Chief Justice Madden. Those that treat of
gloomy subjects are very like the “Magpies
making their Home Flight,” on page 19 : —
With hues half stolen from the night
They come while day is dying,
By twos and threes in broken flight,
The magpies homeward flying.
O’Hara’s claim to be a poet is confronted, how-
ever, with the tough fact that he has no sense of
humor. In ‘ ‘ An Old Hut, ” where he becomes low-
spirited for once, the rhymester gives us in all
seriousness an imitation of Swinburne’s “ Deserted
Garden,” which is merely a parody, with the joke
omitted :—
Yet here in the seasons of old loud laughter
And music and mirth the glad winds fraught,
Men took no thought of the quick hereafter
In a world where delight through change was wrought;
They are mirthless now ! for the wind that, wanders
Moaning its pain tor the old time fled
Over their graves the lost leaf squanders,
Over the dead.
As an alleged original poem, “ An Old Hut ” is a
ridiculous instance of young Australian cheek.
For unquestionable proof of which assertion look
, up “ A Deserted Pub.,” in The Bulletin a few
months ago.

Of things that never happen and deeds that aren’t
done ?
That men are mostly liars is a saying true and
trite,
Tor the fish we fail to hook always bite the biggest
bite;
And the fiercest cyclone blowing never whirled
along its track
With half the speedy finish of the horse we didn’t
back.
’Mid all the contradictions, ’mid fables old and
new,
And prophecies that never can by any chance
come true,
The chief of all illusions, marching proudly in the
van,
Is the myth about the “ popping of the question ”
by the man.
In prose and poems endless we read how men
have tossed
Long nights in sleepless anguish, and their appe-
tites have lost,
In direst trepidation, and in agonising dread,
Rehearsing oft the words to charm the girl they
wish to wed.
But those words are never spoken ! Lovers look in
lovers’ eyes,
And two souls drift together ; then they find, with
feigned surprise,
That neither can remember how, or why, or when,
or where,
He “popped” the fearful question—and they
hardly ever care.
’Tis a world of paradoxes, but the man ne’er slept,
or dined
Could set things right exactly. So we simply “go
it blind.”
We canonise illusions and accept without demur
The paradox of deeds undone and things that don’t
occur.

a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s Purely Herbal “Alkaline Vitality Pills,"
which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare Completely Cured Me within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since. ’The Alkaline Pills' also
cured my wife, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
llkkr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to trv your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and 1 shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August. 1894
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sy. ep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Su’livan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday It< ol< the hrst
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.

of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the

other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet

S.G. :—“An ingenious explanation by the
Zoologist of the kea-parrot’s weakness for kidney-
fat is that the bird originally fed on lichens grow-
ing on stones, that it mistook sheep for stones and
wool for lichens, that it alighted well down the
sheep’s back to escape the beast’s bites, and that
it thus discovered the delights of kidney-fat by
sheer accident. But there are many other curious
points needing explanation. How did the first
few keas who tasted fat tell the other keas about
it? How did they come to remember the sheeps
anatomy so well as to exactly locate the kidneys .
Why do they confine themselves to kidney-fat .
How was the knowledge handed down ? More-
over and especially does a young kea untaught by
its parents attack the sheep like wild birds ? ”

STARVED IN MUTINY.
A famous mutiny on shipboard came to pass in
this way : When the ship, which had sailed from
London, was well down the Channel, it was found
that the provisions intended for the use of the
crew were rotten and, of course, uneatable. The
men complained to the captain, who promised to
put into some near port, and exchange the bad
stores for good. He failed to keep his word, and
as the poor sailors couldn’t sail the ship 10,000
miles on empty stomachs they killed the captain
and mate, helped themselves to the cabin pro-
visions, held high jinks for a few weeks, and finally
scuttled the ship, put off in the boats, and were
all lost but three. The captain could have pre-
vented all this if he had chosen to; but perhaps
the owners and he had put up the bad job on the
men. Very likely, and got served out for it.
They were both criminals and fools.
But there are ships that must needs sail to the
end of the voyage with only the original stores.
Come what may, they can’t go back or put into
any port. Some are well found and others badly;
and so voyages differ.
To modify the illustration, the latter kind of
vessels are human beings. At birth we sail on a
voyage, which by rights ought to be seventy years
long. But how many of us continue on the Sea
of Life that long ? Very few, comparatively.
Most of us go down sooner. Why ? Because we
recklessly, carelessly, or ignorantly waste the stock
of vital force with which Nature endows us at the
start, There are no meat shops or bakeries on the
Atlantic, nor are there any places after birth
where we can beg or buy more “ life.” This is
perfectly plain to me. Is it plain to you ? lam
afraid it isn’t. Let’s see whether a little incident
will throw light on it.
Mr. Henry Fish had been a fortunate man. His
forbears had done well by him. Up to the
autumn of 1890 he could say, “ I have always
been strong and healthy. ” For 30 years he had
worked as a painter for one employer. He
must have been not only a healtny man, but
a good painter. So far his “ vitality,” his
constitution had been equal to all demands on
it. It had endured a lot of hard work, resisted
the weather, and digested his food. Then it
refused to go on. It struck work. It wouldn’t
make sail or pull an oar. In plain English,
the symptoms or signs of the trouble were these :
Loss of appetite, bad taste in the mouth, terrible
pains after eating, yellow eyes and skin, and
rheumatic gout in the feet. His legs and stomach
became fearfully swollen, and his heart palpitated
and thumped frightfully nearly all the time. On
account of the distress given him by solid food he
could only eat slops, and not much strength can
be got out of them.
By-and-by the best he could do was to hobble
about on crutches. He could not lie abed at all,
because he couldn’t draw his breath when lying
down. For over a month he snatched what sleep
he could when supported upright on his crutches.
Just think of that, and be thankful it wasn’t your
case. He wasn’t able to lift his hand to his mouth,
and had to be nursed night and day. He got so
low (in spite of doctors attending him) that he
didn’t expect to live, and didn’t desire to. One
doctor said he had heart disease, and that his
heart was big as a bullock’s, which was nonsense.
During all this illness Mr. Fish had a professional
nurse from a convalescent home. When he had
sunk so low as to make it a wonder how he kept
dive at all, he first heard of the medicine which
finally cured him. In concluding his letter he
says : “ After beginning to take Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup I never looked behind me. I got
stronger every day, and have ailed nothing since.
This medicine saved my life, and I want the public
to know it. (Signed) Henry Fish, Great Malvern,
County of Worcester, January 12th, 1893.”
Only a word more. We spoke of men and
women being like ships that have to sail to the end
)f the voyage with what supplies they start with.
By that we mean, not supplies of food, but supply
of power to digest food. You see the difference?
Bread and butter are no better than lead and
leather if you can’t digest them. In Mr. Fish’s
case it was not food that failed, but power to use
it. He had indigestion and dyspepsia. The
wonderful remedy discovered by Mother Seigel
stopped the waste of vitality caused by the
disease, and enabled Nature to use food to build
up the perishing body. He will now proceed, we
hope, towards the port of Old Age, with favoring
winds.
Yet, save for timely rescue, he would doubtless
have gone down, as millions do, leaving but a
momentary eddy over the spot where they
disappear.
Eno’s “ Fbuit Salt acts as simply, yet just as
pov er'ully on the animal system, as sunshine does
on th) vegetable wor'd. It has a natural action
or tne organs of digestion, absorption, circulation,
r esi iration, secretion, and excretion, and removes
al impurities, thus preserving and restoring
i.ealth. Sold by all chemists and stores.
, Nobility and deity are closely connected
m the English mind. The doctrine of right
divine still lingers concealed in the heart of the
-British Philistine. Godship and lordship are
synonyms to a large section of the Anglo-Saxon
people both at home and abroad. The Anglican
hymns address God as “My Lord ” ; with a little
provocation, the average Anglican Tory would
address a lord as “ My God !”
Camels cannot be landed in W.A. without
first undergoing Govt, veterinary inspection. But
diseased specimens get there all the same via the
northern ports, for the wise Forrest crowd provides
only one vet. surgeon, and he resides at Fremantle.
khe w ay, near Geraldton, there is a 360-acre
patch grazing” 480 camels—on country, too,
that won’t carry one sheep to 10 acres ! The
camel must be a sandivorous animal.
“The biggest shilling’s-worth ever pub-
hshed ’ .is Messrs. W. H. Glen and Co.’s (Melb.)
affirmation re No. 29 of their “ Colonial Musical
Cabinet. After looking through the book, and
with' -it disputing the publisher’s statements, it
mi 0 nt be preferable to put the matter in a different
way. Apart altogether from the grossly material
aspect of sheer avoirdupois, the Cabinet contains
an admirable selection of the best songs. One of
them, “My Lad,” is worth double the money
charged for the whole book, and is one of the very
sweetest baritone ballads ever written.*
According to A. J. Boyd, the remora, or
sucking-fish, is caught by the natives of the islands
off the N.E. coast of Australia with blunted hooks,
kept alongside the canoe by a strong line,
and thrown out at the first turtle which makes its
appearance. The remora attaches himself by
means of his adhesive apparatus to the turtle and
is hauled in along with his prize. He is now
detached from his victim, thrown overboard again
te follow the boat at the end of his leading-string,
and to be rewarded by sundry pickings. It is
said the remora becomes quite attached to its
human co-workers, and can even distinguish one
from the other. Sounds Munchausenic, but is
none the less averred to be perfectly true.
Dear Bulletin.—l think this may be
fairly set down as a tight place. When a tiger-
cat s eyeballs glare out from the darkness of a
hollow log, the bushman will allow, for the time
being, that the cat has sound possession ; and will
not crawl in after its scalp, nor will he insist on
his dog doing so. When the cat is ejected the
dog may win the victory, if he gets first “holt,”
otherwise there is nothing but skin and hair and
yelps and curses. Therefore, my yarn will be
seriously doubted. A large domestic “ Thomas ”
cat of ours has continually captured ’possums, and
even native cats, and he generally brings in the
spoil for exhibition. A few mornings ago he ap-
peared, tail first, yanking along a fine slain tiger-
cat, yet warm. Thomas drew his trophy on to
the verandah, with the mixed expression of one
who has met with a horrible nightmare, a railway
collision, and a mighty triumph. He is now laid
up for repairs.— Jack Bird.
“ Federation ” will, ere long, become a
word which the public will loath to hear—the
Melbourne public especially. In that city and its
suburbs, no function, from the opening of a church
fair to the consecration of a new tip-dray, is con-
sidered complete if somebody doesn’t rise up and
make a passionate harangue upon the subject of
Federation. There isn y t a little tin-pot local
orator or municipal mutton-head all over the place,
who doesn’t deem it his “dooty” to indulge in
some ecstatic fustian (mostly borrowed from the
speeches of men like Deakin, who should know
better) in dealing with the question—a question in
no way connected with exigencies and responsibili-
ties involved in the consecration of a tip-dray or
the “ inauguration ” of a new boiling-down works.
The result is that when even the best friends of
the movement see any mention of it in the papers,
they skip the passage. Federation is a great
wheel, but too many flies want to ride upon it.
If something disastrous doesn’t happen to a few
of them they will, by sheer force of persistent dul-
ness, end in making the biggest and best Aus-
tralian ideal, up to date, an intolerable bore, and a
subject to be tabooed in any company outside of
Fatmandom and Bumbledom. “ Avec ton Etre
Supreme,” said Billaud to Robespierre, “tu com-
mences m’embdter.” A pregnant saying, even
though the remark might have been made by a
better man.

Dear Bulletin, — Re sleeping while stand-
ing. While acting as engineer on an ocean
steamer, ] went on watch one night at 12 o’clock.
It was hot weather and 1 had had very little sleep
tor days. At 3 o’clock I took the usual look round
the engines and boilers, then stood back against
the bunker under the telegraph. I dropped off to
sleep thus. Waking with a start I rushed round
the engines, felt the bearings and tried the water
in the boiler gauge-glasses. All was right. With
a sigh of relief I returned to the front again and
looked at the clock over the telegraph ; it was just
tour minutes past three. I had been asleep about
one minute, but never again did that happen—the
shock was too great.—F. C.
Rats have of late been actually cultivated
for industrial purposes. In Paris there is a great
pond surrounded by a wall. Into this pond are
thrown all sorts of carcases. Inside the walls are
located huge crowds of rats, which feed on the
dead bodies. At certain intervals the rats are
hunted into numbers of holes round the base of
the wall which will admit their bodies, but not
’ : l . e . lt 'i * a d s . Men then go round with bags, in
which the rats, yanked out by their tails, are col-
lected. The carcases are eaten down to the clean-
polished bones, which are then sold to the phos-
phorus-makers. The rats’ fur is sold for felt, the
skins to glove-makers, the thigh-bones for tooth-
picks, and the tendons are boiled for gelatine for
bonbon-wrappers.
A few extracts from Miss A. Murphy’s
account of her own heroic self in “ One Woman’s
Wisdom :
Full within a few weeks of her departure for Australia,
Mary had regarded herself as a commonplace nonentity,
but (something or other) awakened her soul to the know-
lcdge that the world was not only indifferent. . . Her
forehead was almost massive, and the chin, though finely
formed, was indicative of great strength of purpose. Her
eyes were so strangely grey that few ever guessed their
real color, &c., &c., even when the corners of her well-
shaped mouth were turned up in a roguish smile. Her
pale face gave her a foreign look, but any suggestion of
Spanish descent, &c., &c. The fascination of her manner
became a matter of general comment among her friends,
and on all sides she was held to be a distinct and popular
success. With women she became a special favorite. The
greatest of French tragediennes, who paid a flying visit
to bourneville (Smellbourne) had grown enthusiastic over
her as “La Charmante fille avec la belle tete.” Five years
colonial residence found Mary (Murphy) developed into a
hi oad-minded, charmingly confident woman, who reached
her majority, &c., &c. To give pleasure and benefit to
those she loved was the absorbing interest of her life,
carrying with it the broader sympathy of a general
mission of joy even to the world beyond her own (Murphy
has evidently decided to make things hum in Heaven).
Nothing was more remarkable than the manner in which
women and men of mature ages and liberal education
accepted the suggestions and guidance of the young
enthusiast. She led and used them with wondrous tact
and appeared to be unconscious of her real strength.
Her popularity was, at the time, remarkable, and occa-
sionally when adulation, compliments, and the more
practical evidences of f riendly esteem were showered upon
her, &c. (how much? . . . When the Governor caught sight
of her, he hurried across the ballroom . . . Within the first
twenty-four hours of a visit she usually managed to reveal
herself in a score of moods, and each one delightful.
There was a singular magnetic influence about her, which
gave an expression of daring frankness, a voice of surpassing
softness, and n manner of insinuating charm, enhanced
to an irresistible degree."
And so on. borne careless, irrevetent Cockney
reviewer dismisses Agnes Murphy’s book with the
sneer that he can’t think what it is all about.
Blind creature ! “ One Woman’s Desire ”is all
about Murphy and her wondrous celebrity in the
great world that extends from Toorak to the
Austral Salon. The one Woman with the Wisdom
is the adulated, irresistible Agnes. A sublime
idiot called Frank figures frequently among the
planet’s satellites, and catalogues her achievements
on pages 286-7
You have riddled many of Mrs. Grundy’s most
cherished traditions, and you have brought freedom of
action within the reach of many women who before were
meshed in the network of present-day shams. You have
proved that marriage and motherhood are not always
essential to a perfect wonanhood. You are happy in your
stand, and thousands will be happier for it.”
A murrain on the bloated foreign reviewer who
doesn’t know what Miss Murphy’s “ novel ” is all
ibout! Odds bodikins ! ’Tis a glorified auto-
biography by the ex-“ social editress” of Melb.
Punch, peppered with large libels on small indi-
viduals.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Few Britons are aware that the battle of
Waterloo was won by the Netherlanders. In one
of the Brussels galleries, at all events, is a picture,
symbolic of that decisive struggle, in which the
Lion is represented as triumphing over the Eagle.
But he isn’t the British Lion ! He is identical
with the emblematic beast which surmounts a tall
column on the Waterloo Plain of Batavia—a
column further ornamented with an inscription
severely contradictory of the notion that the
British troops were obliged to open their ranks to
let the Netherlanders run away. For it was in-
dubitably the latter, saith this veracious legend,
who did the work and should receive the glory.
“ Hang me ! ” said Hambleton, “ if that doesn’t
break the record ! ”
He didn’t know that the Russians, upon their
own authority, won every fight in the Crimea, or
that, according to Danish history, Nelson was
well thrashed at Copenhagen. Therefore, this
thing, he repeated, broke the record for downright
crammers, and, as Staagel’s English didn’t run to
such recondite idioms, Hambleton explained to him
in more orthodox phrase that the statement before
them was the most outrageous lie ever committed
to stone —“ or to paper, for that matter !”
The Dutchman’s face grew dark, if such a term
can apply to a countenance for redness and
rotundity like unto the rising sun. He pulled out
into martial spikes the ends of his maize-colored
moustache, as it dawned upon him that possibly
the insufferable self-conceit of the Englanders
might haw made them imagine themselves the
heroes of that famous dav. Therefore, he spoke
quietly.
“Do I understand you to infer, mynheer, that
the honors of the occasion fell principally to your
countrymen ? ”
“ Infer ? I don’t infer ! I say it straight out.
And not ‘principally,’ but altogether! D’ye
mean to say you don’t know that ?—even if you
are a Dutchman ! ”
Staagel made as low a bow as his circumference
would admit of.
“I do not know it, sir. But Ido know how
remarkable are the English for modesty and—
courtesy ! ”
The Briton—incapable of sarcasm himself—was,
by the law of compensation, proof against its
shafts. He took out his cigar and stared.
“Pretty well for courtesy,” he said. “But I
don’t know so much about the modesty ! ”
“ The reservation itself is modest, sir ! But,
tell me—if the Englanders, as you say, played the
leading part at Waterloo, what share in the pro-
ceedings fell to the Netherlanders ?”
“ The —ha—ha—the discretionary part.”
“ Pardon me ? ”
“ Discretion ! —better part of valour, you know !
Live to fight another day, and all that sort of
thing !” Hambleton’s big white teeth shone out
in appreciation of his own wit.
But the Dutchman understood only that he was
being laughed at.
Mynheer,” he said, “this may turn out a less
amusing matter than you suppose. Where, I
repeat, did the Netherlanders come in ? —to use a
phrase of your own.”
Hambleton’s loud laugh went up amongst the
kanary-trees.
<l ,y didn’t come in at all—that’s just it !
I hey—hee-haw!—they went off I See?”
“ Ran away, do you mean ? ”
“ Exactly ! And our chaps had to open out to
let em do it! Haw—haw—hwagh—gh ! ” Hol-
land was pulling England’s nose, whereupon Eng-
mnd, proceeding, secundum artern, to knock
Holland down, was, to its huge astonishment, laid
handsomely out with such a rattler on the nose as
nobody could have expected from a casky little
man of five-feet-nothing.
The redeeming characteristic of the bovine
stamp of Englishman showed up as Hambleton
got slowly to his feet again.
“By Jove !” he said, “ you can let out! Who’d
have thought it was in you ! But come on, and—
what’s this ? ” The Dutchman was handing him a
card. “ Oh, I see ! —send a friend to you, and so
on ! Yes, I suppose you do that sort of thing
here. But it’s devilish ridiculous, you kpow ; I’d
a lot sooner finish it this way.”
It was Staagel’s turn to laugh now. “Better
not, I think—see there ! ” Some soldiers from the
barracks were coming over to investigate a matter
about which the rapidly-growing dusk made them
uncertain. “ I have written my address on the
card, and shall expect to hear from you to-
morrow.” He lifted his hat and went jauntily
away.
The Englishman laughed at himself. “You
got it properly that time, old man—and no mis-
take ! I’ll look up Schwartzberg to-night, for I
suppose I’ll have to challenge this plucky little
spitfire; though, ’pon my soul, it’s quite too
utterly absurd ! ”
■* * * ♦
“ Oh, I know Staagel,” Dr. Schwartzberg
said when he looked at the card. “ He’s rather
what you call a fire-eater, too—been ‘ out ’ several
times already. Do you know what he does ? ”
“ Hits confoundedly hard, for one thing,”
Hambleton said, rubbing his swollen nose.
“ Ecce signum/” said the German laughing.
“ But I mean that he teaches boxing and the
savate at the Ecole Gymnastique.”
“ What ?—that fat little tub ! He can hit like
a small Sullivan, as I’ve reason to know, but I
shouldn’t think he’d have much more activity than
a pound of butter. ”
“ I think you Englanders are a good deal in
error about fat. My experience is that a fat man
who will take the necessary exercise is under no
athletic disadvantage except that of the extra
weight. But, look here —can you do anything
with the sword ? ”
“Not much ! ”
“ So I supposed ; and so Staagel will suppose—
for which reason he’s pretty sure to choose the
steel. He’ll have the option, you know.”
“ Can’t be helped ! When shall you see him ? ”
“ This afternoon. But you haven’t told me
what he struck you for; there may be negotia-
tions, you see.”
“Oh, I said—but never mind ! —I won't apolo-
gise, and he can’t —for this! ” Hambleton touched
his nose.
“No ! —I suppose there’s no other way out of it.
You’re at the Nederlanden ? Yes ! Well, expect
me at six.”
Le Chauffeur screwed up his narrow black
eyes as he listened.
“ Diantre /” he said, “ but that was excellent!
I should have liked to behold the islander when
he was—what does their Shakespeare say?—
* hoist with his own ’ something. Has he sent
anybody, yet ? ”
“ Schwartzberg ; that big German doctor you’ve
seen at the gymnasium a few times. He lives
j n »
“Oh, I know! Pll see him at once, then.”
The professor of fencing took his hat, but turned
suddenly at the door. 66 You’ve forgotten to tell
me why you struck him. I may have to
arrange ”
“ There can be no arrangement. He said—or
insinuated—that we Netherlanders are cowards. ”
“ Pouf/” Monsieur Le Chauffeur hoisted his
shoulders to his ears, turned out his palms, and
departed whistling “ Malbrook s’en va-t-en
guerre I”
* * , ,
“It is infinitely to be regretted, men-
sieur, Dr. Schwartzberg said, “but there is
no apology possible from us. You struck us, you
see an s rue us ard.
bjuite so , monsieur le docteur t And, unfor-
tunately, it is equally out of the question that
any amende should come from us. We have been
called a coward. Was monsieur not aware ? ” Le
Chauffeur asked, noticing the other’s surprised
IqqJj
“No; my principal didn’t tell me any more
than that he wouldn’t apologise.”
The Frenchman shook his skull-cropped head.
“ It is very irregular-the seconds should be pos-
sessed of all the facts. However, as we are not in
France—let us say Rajassan-the bamboo-bridge
—six, to-morrow morning—swords ! ”
“ Couldn’t you make it pistols? ” Schwartzberg
said; “your man is a capital shot.”
“ My man, with my consent, shall throw away
no chance. Swords, monsieur-swords-and six
in the morning. Aurevoir!”
* * * *
T o-ioo ! io-ioo ! fo-foo ! shrieked
the red-crested woodpecker, as the intending com-
batants took off their coats—the Dutchman cool,
because of confidence; the Englishman cooler,
because of the want of it. .
Schwartzberg, the best-brained man of the four,
made a final effort.
“Your principal, Monsieur Le Chauffeur, has
suffered the slighter indignity. Will he now, at
the last moment, express any regret ? ”
“Will Mynheer the Englander,” said Staagel,
when the question had been repeated to him,
“ acknowledge even that the Netherlanders did as
much as the Englanders for the defeat of the
French ? ”
‘ ‘ Of the French ! ” echoed Le Chauffeur, with a
stare of surprise. “How, monsieur?—when?—
and where?’ _ _
The Dutchman bit his lip. “ I forgot your
nationality, Le Chauffeur, for the moment! But,
since you must know—at Waterloo ! The Eng-
lander said that the victory was entirely due to
his people—said, in fact, that the Netherlanders
ran—that is, retreated ! You know better than
that, don’t you ? ”
The Gaul bristled up in a moment. “ But I do
not know better, Monsieur Staagel. It is very
probable they did, when they saw that the irresist-
lble star of Napoleon was to shine with the lustre
of yet another triumph ! ”
“Triumph? Are you mad? Do you call
Waterloo a triumph for Napoleon ? ”
“Practically, monsieur! A virtual triumph,
because, if—but, hold ! Do you say it was
defeat ? ”
“Am I an idiot? Of course I say it was a
defeat —a crushing defeat ! ”
“Then ; monsieur ? I cannot act for you in this
matter, since you will yourself have to answer thii
insolence to me ! ”
“As soon as you like!” shouted the equally
fiery Dutchman. “ Get a sword, and come on.”
Le Chauffeur became in an instant cool, bowed
stiffly, and walked back to the Englishman’s
second.
“ I have the honor to inform you, Dr. Schwartz
berg, that, owing to a difference with my prin-
cipal, I cannot now act as his second. He him-
self has now to give me satisfaction for an un-
pardonable insult.
“I profoundly regret to hear it, Monsieur Lt
Chauffeur,” returned the German, with a smile
lurking in his russet beard, for he couldn’t help
having heard what he was not supposed to be
officially aware of.
“You are pleased to be amused, monsieur!”
returned the Frenchman, instantly. “ Perhaps
you are also of opinion that Waterloo was a defeat
for the French ? ”
“You surmise correctly, monsieur. It was more
than a defeat for them —it was a catastrophe ! ”
“Enough, sir! enough !” Le Chauffeur stamped
on the graund. “If you can induce Monsieur
Staagel to act for you, I will request the same
favor of your late principal, and the matter can
be settled forthwith. Monsieur L’Anglais,” he
went on, walking up to Hambleton, “ your late
second has just had the temerity to tell me to my
face that Waterloo was a catastrophe for the
French. If you will honor me by acting as my
second ”■
‘ ‘ Scarcely, sir—upon those grounds. My late
second, as you call him, was perfectly correct.”
“ Very good, monsieur ! then my quarrel is first
with you. Take your sword and let us get to
business. ”
The slow-match of the Englishman’s tempera-
ment burnt at last into the magazine of his anger.
“ Hang it all! ”he growled—“ I don’t care whom
I fight with as long as we make an end of this
palaver. Schwartzberg,” he added, “ just do the
needful for me. Our Gallic friend here would
have us believe the English didn’t thrash him well
at Waterloo.”
The German stiffened up like a ramrod. “ I
cannot say that Monsieur Le Chauffeur is very
wrong there. If he had denied it of the Prussians
now ”
“ The Prussians ? Confound it all, man ! —you
don’t mean to say the wooden-headed Prussians
won the battle ? ”
“lam of that opinion, sir ! And, if you apply
the term ‘ wooden-headed ’ to me ”
“You’ll want my blood, next, I suppose!
Well, come on, then! —you, or anybody else !
I’m about sick of this ! ”
He snatched up a sword, listened for a moment
as the woodpecker cried again, then threw the
weapon down and burst into a laugh.
“Listen!” he said. “ Fo-foo—fo-foo—fo-foo !
The bird’s right. Four fools —four fools —four
fools ! ”
The ludicrous resemblance finished it. The
other three joined, perforce, in the Englishman’s
laughter; hands were shaken, sworcs and griev-
ances put up, and the four fools went back four
friends.

A Coolgardie Episode.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We had tried our luck at Hannan’s, the White
Feather, Kurnalpi, and Siberia. At Siberia we
nearly perished ; and as the other camps had
yielded little more than “tucker,” we concluded
our mana had cut out, so we drifted back to Cool-
gardie and camped on “The Reserve.”
At first, there were six of us, in three 12 x 10
tents close together. Twenty yards on our right
stood a Hessian-roofed “whare,” tenanted by a
man and his wife. Over all lay the thick Cool-
gardie atmosphere, heavy with more stinks than
Cologne ever dreamt of. The sun glared down ;
we sweltered and stifled.
The owner of the Hessian “whare” and his
wife were the first to “ knock under.” Poor little
woman ! she was pluck to the toes ; but concen-
trated Coolg irdie essence was too much for her.
A few mornings after, one of us, an ex lawyer’s
clerk, “ felt very queer,” and turned in for the
day. Before the end of another week the rest of
the camp found it necessary to turn in too.
We cursed the flies and the fever. And now
and again, one of the crowd (two of us came from
Maoriland) would start up from a feverish dream
of fern-clad hills and well-watered gullies, thinking
he heard the tui’s call in the rata trees, and smelt
the lingering perfume of new-mown hay—start up
to stare out over the dull reality of sandy, stunted
bush plain, and listen to the jingling din of camel
bells and the noise of horses feeding. Then he
would include the city of dreadful -dust in one
comprehensive cure, and fall back in bed—to try
and dream again.
One old nurse watched the lot of us. Bravely
she stuck to her guns—and her arrowroot. The
doctor, just over from Sydney, dropped in
occasionally. He genially assured us that if the
high percentage of cases kept up, and hi.- p , tients
panned out all right, he would soon go back with
a pile. “ A great country,” he remarked with a
satisfied air as he left the tents. Next day he
joined us in a private hospital bed near by.
The ex-lawyer’s clerk woke me one night, and,
turning over with a groan, whispered, “ I reckon
I’ll have to go below and jo.n the sleeping partner
in the old firm.” He went. The funeral pro-
cession, consisting of a clergyman, a dray and a
driver, was not considered too modest and inex-
pensive at Coolgardie.
Before another week three more, including the
little woman—to vary the monotony, perhaps—
went prospecting new country on the banks of the
river Jordan.
Ben and I were able, after a time, to stagger up
and about. One of the first who called on us was
the sanitary inspector. He informed us “we were
liable to be fined for keep.ng insanitary premises,”
and proceeded to burn down all around us. Ben
stopped my hands from going up. He said:
“ You’re too weak ! Anyhow, you’ll have a big
contract on hand if you take on all their jumped-
up officials. ”

TE PAHAUA.
On Cheviot Hills station, near Hamilton,
Vic., is a comeback wether which has been leading
the flocks to the woolshed for the last 18 years,
and is still going strong save on very hot davf
when it shows a tendency to “ strike.”
Wodonga (Vic.) Sentinel, of 25tli Decem-
ber, reprints from The Bulletin W. H. Ogilvie’s
fine poem, “ From the Gulf," without the slightest
acknowledgment, the idea conveyed being that
Mr. Ogilvie wrote his poem expressly for the
Wodonga Sentinel— which he didn’t. And even
a paper of the Melbourne Leader’s alleged
standard is not above this sort of meanness. In
its issue of December 28 it starts a paragraph
thus—
What a wonderful family-likeness there is in all the ex-
ponents of Freetrade drivel. This is from the Sydney
Telegraph : “ We cannot bar imports without, to the
same extent, barring exports. The countries which buy
our products have nothing to pay for them with but pro-
ducts of their own. According as we tax the bringing in
of those products, therefore, we tax the sending out of
ours, for which they are sent here in payment. It is only
a Freetrade Government, therefore, that can consistently
as ,:st in the development of an export industry.” Where-
fore a New South Wales Protectionist responds with a
question— &c., &c.
Then follows about half-a-column of refutation.
The “N.S.W. Protectionist” in question is The
Bulletin, and if this paper’s matter is good
enough for the Leader to make use of it is also
good enough to acknowledge, The Telegraph,
being a respectable orthodox print which doesn’t
say painful things about Brassey, can be men-
tioned in full, if necessary, but this objectionable
rag can only be described by a hyphen and a long
shudder.
Botli Melb. dailies omitted to notice
“ Banjo's ” book until it had reached its third
edition - then came half-columns of fulsome adula-
tion. r l li:s is what is known in certain quarters as
cr i i jisni. Apropos the carping critics who accuse
‘ Banjo ” of adopting Gordon’s methods. No two
men’s styles could be more dissimilar: Gordon is
a poet pure and simple, while “ Banjo ” is a
baliadist, and, whatever their respective merits,
the baliadist will always have ten readers to the
poet’s one. As usual, none of the “criticisms”
contained any mention of Thßulletin —they
did not even take the trouble to affect the igno-
rance which the Argus displayed when “ By Reef
and Palm” appeared: “These stories bear the
appearance of having been published in some
journal previously ! ” And yet an acknowledgment
to The Bulletin stared the “ reader ” in the face
on the first page of the book. How mad the
“ great ” papers are that every Australian writer
who, for many years, has scored a local literary
success, has been a well-known Bulletin con-
tributor !
The Tasmanian Baptist Union is urging
the Govt, to chase out of Tasmania Tattersall’s Con-
sultations, whose headquarters are now at Hobart.
The Union loathes the lucre that accrues to the
local Post-office through the odious vice of
gambling; but The Bulletin wagers that if the
State offered the Baptists a choice between raising
revenue out of consultations and raising it by
taxation to a similar amount on church buildings,
the Union would declare for gambling with a voice
that could be heard across Bass’s Straits. Tatter-
sall’s Sweep, which will, wherever it may be con-
ducted, get its due quota of Tasmanian money,
would probably yield much over .£20,0 0 a year to
the Tas. revenue. The local public debt now
stands at something like £7,500,000, and the in-
terest thereon is about £9OO a day, payable by a
papulation of about 160,000. The Tasmanian
Crown Ministers, by the way, draw £6lO a year
only, with the exception of the Premier, who
works for mere honor and glory, and takes no pay.
More—it is said he retrenches so vigorously that
in cases where he is unable to absolutely abolish
fires in any department under his control
he goes round daily with the tongs
and picks pieces of coal out of the office
scuttles in the interests of economy. So that it is
not likely Tasmania will abolish Tattersall in a
hurry. In the Land of Snakes, Apples and Women
no ole readily relaxes his grip of money. There
is a, story of two festive visitors from Australia
who found themselves arraigned before Hobart
police-court one morning for having been drunk
and disorderly the night before. At the same
time was also charged a Tasmanian identity who
told them when they met in court that he had no
money and piteously remarked that he was dying
of rheumatiz, that the cells were very cold in
winter, and if he couldn't raise 10s. he would have
to go to gaol for a fortnight. Moved by pity, the
visitors subscribed ss. each, which he put into his
pocket. When the case was called on he pleaded
guilty and was fined half a sov. “ I’ll take it out,
your worship,” said that Tasmanian. He wasn’t
going to part with ten beautiful shillings !
Neither, may it be predicted, will the Tasmanian
Govt. readily part with Tatt.’s beautiful shillings,
Baptist union or no Baptist union.
Dear Bulletin, — lie the typical up-
country journal. A while back I was offered a
“ new. piper ” business, cheap, in a Maoriland
township. The circulation was set down as 120,
but, on enquiry, I found that only three sub-
scribers ever paid. The remainder was made up
of advertisers’ copies and exchanges. And they
were advertisers ! — Thorold W.
Melton Pwiah, the war-cowwespondent,
interviewed for the Idler and asked to mention the
most affecting incident in his career, proceeds to
maunder over the woe of the Russian Empress at
the burial of the late Czar :
“ Inured as I am to affecting scenes, I could not look on
unmoved as our beloved Princess stepped hastily forward
and drew the Empress within the shelter of her arms.”
Just before this Prior had been telling of seeing a
field strewn with a dead army, and of beholding
the mangled bodies of men and women spread
about after a Coomassie orgy, “mutilated and
naked in the glare of a tropical sun, some still
warm and quivering.' It is a magnificent spirit
of grovel that makes the blood of an army count
for nothing beside the tears of an Empress.
In the days when Lachlan Macquarie
reigned at Botany Bay, a veteran pedagogue (an
old-country crony of the Governor) “taught the
young idea ” near Windsor, then the ultima thulc
of civilisation. The caligraphic accomplishments
of the majority of the early settlers, both free and
bond, being , “his x mark,” the school-
master’s quill was frequently employed in drawing
up formal applications for grants of land from
time-expired convicts or persons who desired a
reward for services, real or imaginary, past or pro-
spective. Thinking that he also might as well
become a landed proprietor, the poor schoolmaster
took advantage himself of a trip to the metro-
polis to interview the companion of his boyhood
and put in a claim in person. He was at once
offered a 60-acre block near Brickfield Hill, in
what is now the heart of the city of Sydney.
“ Damn it, Mac ! gie us a better piece than that;
it wouldn’t grow a cabbage,” replied the disgusted
applicant, who was finally appeased with an offer
of 200 acres anywhere he liked to select. In the
end the old man took up 60 acres on the Mac-
donald River, a northern affluent of the Hawkes-
bury. But it was fine land for cabbages.
Tamerlane .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lo, upon the carpet, where
Throned upon a heap of slain
Blue-eyed dolls of beauty rare
(Ah, they pleaded all in vain !)
Sits the Infant Tamerlane !
Broken toys upon the floor
Scattered lie—a ruined rout.
Thus from all things evermore
Are—the fact is past a doubt—
Hidden virtues hammered out.
Poet’s page, or statesman’s bust,
Nothing comes to him amiss ;
Everything he clutches must
’Tis his simple dream of bliss !
Suffer his analysis.
0 my little Tamerlane,
Infantile Iconoclast,
Is your small barbaric brain
Not o’erawed by the amassed
Wit and Wisdom of the Past ?
Type are you of that which springs
Ever forth when comes the need,
Overthrowing thrones and kings,
Faithless altar, sapless creed ;
Sowing fresh and living seed.
On the worn-out Roman realm,
In whose purple gnawed the Moth,
Thus its pride to overwhem,
And its State to carve like cloth.
Swept the fierce long-sworded Goth.
Age preserves with doting care
Things from which life long has fled.
Shrieks to see Youth touch a hair
' On the mouldiest mummy-head—
So Egyptians keep their dead.
Youth comes by with head high-reared,
Stares in scorn at these august
Effigies by age revered—
Gilded shapes of Greed and Lust—
Shakes them into rags and dust.
Little vandal, smash away !
Riot while your blood is hot !
If into the world each day
Such as you are entered not,
It would perish of dry-rot.
