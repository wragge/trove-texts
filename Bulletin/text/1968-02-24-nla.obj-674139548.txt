SLUMP
RECENT MOVES by various agencies
to persuade North Vietnam to attend
peace talks are of the utmost delicacy.
Hopes rise and are dashed almost day
by day. A sub-editor on the Mel-
bourne “Age” trying to sum up the
current position produced something of
a classic in headings, “VIETNAM
PEACE BID HOPE SLUMPS.”
WHEN THE SUN HAS SET
“GOOD EVENING” — it was, per-
haps, the first time we have heard
those words at 8.30 a.m. — began Mr.
Harold Macmillan at Circular Quay,
where he saw expensive new buildings
as “symbols of Australia’s growth
potential,” and an indicator of the role
Australia was financially able to play in
South-East Asia
Macmillan’s greetings to the Press in
the Observation Lounge on board the
Iberia in Sydney. Against the semi-
circle of green and blue chairs and a
gaily colored mural of a Mediterran-
ean scene white buildings, blue
mountains, and a flourish of brilliantly
painted feluccas —he seemed very much
a figure from the past, and modestly
conscious of it: “Good evening . . .
when the sun has declined or even set
... it is flattering that one can attract
He wore his old-fashioned clothes
loosely, double-breasted dark grey pin-
stripe with jacket falling open slackly,
dark blue tie loosely tied in a very large
knot, showing the top button of the
shirt, gold watchchain pouring from
left lapel button into top pocket, hand-
kerchief bursting untidily out of the
same pocket. His famous sleepy-slopy
eyes flicked constantly to and fro, the
corners depressed into wrinkles like an
ancient Chinese sage’s, the expression
one of slightly irritated alarm — an
expression worn for decades.
The words bore the familiar stamp,
phrases about “the great adventure of
Australia so dear to us at home . . .”
and he spoke about the harbor’s “vast
edifices” and “even a theatre — an
opera — which will eventually reach
its conclusion.” The mood of autumnal,
even wintry, resignation was complete:
“When the curtain has fallen the old
actor had better keep off the stage.”
At the end of the Press interviews, with
TV and radio about to begin, he be-
came suddenly rather touchy, saying to
the air, and referring to The Bulletin
(among others), “Can’t they go away?
Those people, over there.”
The cameras of the TV crews
squeaked like animals in pain as they
turned, tape recorders whirled, and
without consulting his watch the Un-
flappable One seemed to know exactly
when it all must end. He concluded the
interviews at the precisely necessary
moment for the beginning of his book-
shop tour, went out on deck and sub-
mitted to more photographs, limping on
his twisted walking stick, the hard
brilliance of the Sydney light making
the crinkled eyes blink as he noted that
The Bulletin had still not gone away.
A POEM LOVELY AS CANBERRA
CANBERRA CITIZENS have for
long lived with the illusion that
their benevolent Government wants
them to live in a “garden city” of trees
and greenery.
And yet this hot summer, the De-
partment of the Interior, which has
responsibility for Canberra’s parks and
gardens, has revealed very offhand
attitudes to the city’s trees. While Mel-
bourne councils have dug little dams
around their street trees and sent water-
tankers around to provide them with
a weekly soaking, Canberra’s authorities
are leaving trees to die though con-
scientiously watering bedding-plants by
Parliament House.
Out in a newly developing housing
area to the north-west the Department
is acquiescing in the massive destruc-
tion of native bushland. One of the
new suburbs involved is called
Aranda, and a lengthy correspondence
in the Canberra “Times” has proceeded
under an imaginative sub-editor’s head
“The Rape of Aranda.” Aranda is on
the lower slopes of Black Mountain,
which has a remarkable and unique
collection of Australian flora, ranging
from rare mountain eucalypts to
orchids. The Government moved in
and felled a large proportion of the
trees and allowed private developers
to fell many of the rest. To the public
outcry which followed, a Departmental
spokesman replied that the gums got
the axe “because they were susceptible
to white-ant infection, dry-rot, and
other diseases.” He didn’t actually say
they harbored these hazards, and local
people wrote in saying that they did
not. The all-wise Department just
eliminated the trees in case they might
have acquired them. Preventative
sanitation you might say.

Hie ofr France,
years, is back as representative of Cur-
tis Brown, probably the largest literary
agency in the world. So far, its Austra-
lian clients include Patrick White,
Margot Campbell, Ian Hamilton,
Edward Lindall, Elyne Mitchell, and
Peter Kenna, who wrote “Slaughter on
St. Teresa’s Day” and is working on a
new play.
As well as fiction, Grose sees an in-
creasing market for Australian educa-
tional books, authoritative books on
Asia, and surprisingly, foreign transla-
tions of Australian children’s books.
“There’s a big demand for children’s
books from other countries in Europe,
because they’re educational. Educa-
tion books are enjoying a tremendous
boom — and there should be a market
for Australian ones in some of the
Pacific countries — the ring of Eng-
lish-speaking countries round Austra-
lia. And we’ve got some of the best
experts on Asia in this country, so some
of the main books on Asia should be
coming out of Australia.”
Curtis Brown’s head office in Lon-
don is divided into specialist depart-
ments, handling English books, plays,
foreign translations, film and television
rights. Its New York branch is not as
specialised, but still rejects a great
proportion of manuscripts.
“The agency acts as a strong filter
—it has a reputation for selling 70
percent of the manuscripts it accepts.
But it has no qualms about accepting
new writers if they’re good. We don’t
actually edit manuscripts, but we do
give writers advice about them.”
Curtis Brown was established at the
turn of the century by an American
journalist posted in London. Hopeful
American friends used to send him
manuscripts, asking him to try to have
them published, until finally he de-
cided to turn himself into a business.
His son expanded the agency, open-
ing an office in New York, and Aus-
tralia is the third branch. Graham
Watson, Curtis Brown’s managing
director, arrives this week to make
contact with Australian publishers,
and Grose himself plans to make regu-
lar trips interstate.
KEEPING THEIR COOL
WHEN Sir Henry Bland shifted
recently from Melbourne into his new
office in Canberra to take up his job
as secretary of the Defence Department,
he immediately started to throw his
weight around. Not to reshape our
defence strategies or anything profound
like that, but to get himself an air-
conditioning unit. An unheard of
personal privilege, his inferiors muttered
jealously. Sir Henry simply said he
couldn’t start work until he had a
tolerable office and the unit was
installed with formalities about authori-
sation and payment to be completed
afterwards.
Officially, Canberra temperatures
have not gone above 106 this summer,
but in the Defence buildings—sited and
designed more to prettily set off the
Australian-American War Memorial
than to keep out the sun—some of the
cooked inhabitants claim to have
recorded temperatures as high as 130.
The s2om. defence complex which is
nearing completion on the north edge
of the lake has been built entirely with-
out air-conditioning—except for the
computers, which very sensibly refuse
to work without it. The 1800
employees, from base-grade clerks and
stenographers to admirals and generals
on $20,000 a year, simply swelter.
How much work they get done on
summer days is anybody’s guess.
Air-conditioning is said to cost be-
tween $2OO and $6OO per office place
and $lO or $2O a year to run, but with
average salaries around $5OOO a year
and Canberra’s inland climate making
temperatures intolerably hot for two of
the year’s 12 months, taxpayers would
seem likely to get a good return on
their money.
Why the rule against air-conditioning
was imposed is hard to track down.
Treasury says it was the Public Service
Board and they say it was Cabinet
fearing the wrath of the afternoon
newspapers, campaigning against
“lavish Canberra spending.” We
couldn’t find anyone in Cabinet who
knew anything more about it than that
their public servants whinged about the
heat.
Other departments say the ban was
the work of a pennypinching Treasury
policy, and they seem to have some-
thing there, because the first new build-
ing to be built with air-conditioning is
the new Treasury office behind the
National Library. But the Treasury
deny the rule has been changed.
It just happens that the Treasury
managed to get its air-conditioning
approved—a “decision made on its
merits, not a change in policy.” It
just happens that with Treasury having
made the breakthrough, everyone else
getting a new building has been get-
ting approval of air-conditioning
through “decisions made on their
merits.” The National Capital De-
velopment Commission has a handsome
white building at Canberra’s maximum
to 12 storeys, cooled to a crisp 65
degrees. Education and Science and
Works are moving into nine-storey air-
conditioned blocks five miles out of
the centre of Canberra in the new
Woden Valley area. And in this week’s
“Canberra Times” tenders are called
for the 14th defence block, ten storeys,
high “with full air-conditioning.”
Meanwhile, Cabinet has somewhere
on its agenda a “comprehensive report”
from an “inter-departmental com-
mittee” urging a “change in policy”
for the incorporation of air-conditioning
in all new Government offices. But as
yet there are no proposals for air-
conditioning in existing buildings. “That
is very damned expensive,” said a Gov-
ernment architect. Which suggests that
our Defence establishment (buildings
one to 13) will continue to swelter.
Unless, that is, they acquire the audacity
of a Bland.

Fast lady
This girl is able to handle 25 external lines and hundreds of internal extensions, with smooth
efficiency . . . and still look after the petty cash.
The first thing you notice, when you
install the STC Pentaconta Pushbutton
PABX, is the staff saving. One girl can
supervise a large board, like this 200-line
extendible unit, with ease. You'll also
notice the gain in communications effi-
ciency.
Your customers will notice it too. They
will discover that calls into your business
are always answered promptly, never
cut off. You will find inter-departmental
and outside calls all go through faster.
Fact is, you now have working for you the
most advanced business telephone system
there is: STC Pentaconta.
The STC Pentaconta does more for you
than any other system. For example, any-
one in your organisation receiving a call
will be able to transfer the caller direct to
any other extension, simply by pressing a
button, without recalling the operator.
Anyone, on any extension, can hold an
outside exchange call while making a
second call, inside or outside. You can
even dial from any extension direct to
your mobile radio vehicles. These features,
speed and reliability, make' the STC
Pentaconta much more than a telephone
system: it's an investment in overall
business efficiency. And more and more
companies, large and not-so-large, are
finding how well it pays off.

Peter Boxall
Eastern’s Regional Manager
Said to Junie Morosi—our Dis-
trict Sales Manager—“ Must make
a memo on Mexico before I come
right back to earth again.’’ “You
enjoyed your trip, I gather,’’ she
smiled.
“Enjoyed? Words can’t describe
Mexico! Ancient Aztec and Mayan
temples at Uxmal . . . do-it-yourself
bull fighting down in Texcoco, water
sports from Acapulco to Yucatan
peninsula, and Eastern Air Lines
will fly visitors from Mexico to the
U.S. (or vice-versa) at the drop of
a sombrero ... it all made me feel
rather proud of our airline!”
“What was the passenger’s
reaction to Eastern’s V.I.P. treat-
ment?” Junie asked. “Great,” I
boasted. “Meals . . . no, banquets
served on the finest Rosenthal
china with sterling silver cutlery,
and crystal for the vintage
wines . .
“Glamorous hostesses in a Don
Loper of Beverley. Hills uniform,”
she added proudly.
“Nothing but the best,” I agreed,
“People here should know more
about Eastern’s marvellous services
in Mexico.”

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
An elegy
for
seven elms
YOU MUST APPRECIATE that here
in Melbourne we feel deeply about
trees. There are other things that
move us to great passion, like the
demon drink, like football, like . . . er
like . . . no, nothing really moves us
like trees.
Melburnians are divided into two
classes, arboreals and anti-arboreals,
those who adore trees and those who
have a huge neurotic passion which can
be eased only by chopping them down.
Your correspondent has just made a
careful survey to discover that since
1961 we have had 84 controversies over
trees, a fine average of 12 a year.
Actually, our best tree controversy
was in 1959. Ah, I remember it well.
The PMG was putting down some new
cables in Collins Street and the work-
men severed some of the roots of the
plane trees, right there in the Paris
end, and the trees began to die.
Among the front-page headlines we
had “Great Tree Tragedy” and “Tree
Murder in Collins Street.” It was
probably the biggest news story of 1959,
and for three months we had recrimi-
nations, accusations, charges, and
counter charges. Every day there were
medical reports on the 12 trees that
were on the seriously ill list. They were
like communiques coming out of the
Royal Melbourne Hospital. Nobody
ever said “The trees are comfortable
this morning,” but they were like that.
Eventually the trees recovered, but,
even now, when the Board of Works,
PMG, and anybody digs a hole in
Collins Street, TV cameramen, news-
paper photographers, the works, swarm
out and the zoom cameras go right
down into the hole to make sure not a
root is disturbed.
Why, in October, 1961, a man was
even sentenced to 14 days’ jail for
wilfully damaging a tree in Dande-
nong Road, Frankston, and in 1963,
when 458 trees had to be replaced in
St. Kilda Road, the agony shook the
Government. All this is to explain
to you why we are so very annoyed
over the axing of seven 80-year-old
elms in St. Kilda Road. For 12 years
the RSL has been campaigning to have
them removed so that we. could get a
clear, uninterrupted view of the Shrine.
If you haven’t been to Melbourne
lately it might be wise to point out
that if one stands in Swanston Street
there is a view of two citadels of
strength at either end—the Shrine and
the Carlton Brewery. You might even
say that they are the symbols of all
culture in Melbourne.
In 1956 the former secretary of the
RSL, Mr. C. W. Joyce, said: “All we
ask for is a clear route to the Shrine.
A tree to me is a tree and if it is in the
way it has to go.”
The Parks and Gardens committee of
the Melbourne City Council refused
the request. However, the RSL is not
without power. Last year they talked
the council into putting a great road
straight up the hill of the Domain to
the Shrine’s front door to make march-
ing easier on Anzac Day. Cost: $32,000,
a great scar across the tuft, all for the
one day of the year.
Meanwhile the RSL kept hammering
for the removal of the seven elms and
the Parks and Gardens committee
magnificently held off the onslaught.
But then something curious happened,
the matter went to the full Council, the
Parks and Gardens committee was over-
ruled, and the trees received the sen-
tence of death. One Labor councillor
said, “It was a victory for the Naval
and Military Club,” and another said it
was “A triumph for pressure groups
politicking within the ruling Civic
group.”
Then the arboreals moved in and
began to attack the Shrine. You must
realise that until now the Shrine has
always been our most precious
possession.
Originally the plan was to build an
Anzac Square by hacking out the area
“Your father’s off to the Dawn Service
at the Shrine!”

between Little Collins and Little Bourke
Streets, right opposite Parliament
House, but then it was felt how much
more fitting to build something solid
on the glorious hill of the Domain by
St. Kilda Road, and so was designed
a replica of the classic tomb erected at
Halicarnassus in 353 B.C. by Queen
Artemisia of Caria to the memory of
her royal husband. The Shrine was
dedicated in November, 1934, and
E. W. Tipping last week recalled in the
“Herald” the words of the late Ambrose
Pratt, “The architect would seem to
have overheard a secret of nature missed
by Pheidas and Iktinos . . . the design
presents all the most perfect features
of classical Grecian architecture in a
combination so harmonious that the
work of Satyos and Pythos is eclipsed
and excelled.”
Whereas last week there was a letter
to the “Herald.-” “Good grief. Why
does the City Council plan to destroy
seven 80-year-old elms for an uninter-
rupted view of a monstrous mixture of
pseudo-classical Greek and Roman
architecture which is known as the
Shrine?” Signed by Valerie Urquhart
and nine others, Oak Grove, East
Malvern.
We are told that it was called “the
beehive” and “the wedding cake.” And
there was the architect who pointed
out how interesting it was that Mel-
bourne’s ugliest buildings were all the
results of architectural competitions,
e.g., the G.P.0., Flinders Street Railway
Station, and the Shrine.
There was even the suggestion that
instead of removing the trees for a better
view of the Shrine, why not remove the
Shrine for a better view of the trees?
The newspapers carefully listed all the
Council’s members who voted for the
axing and all who voted against, so
that by their deeds we should know
them, and the chairman of the Parks
and Gardens committee, Cr. Brens,
said: “I got up and walked out in
disgust. I had fought this for so long—
for ten or 12 years, now it will be an
asphalt jungle.”
The execution, like most executions,
took place early in the morning. On
February 21, at 5.30 a.m., 20 workmen
of the Melbourne City Council with
tractors and power saws removed the
trees. The workmen received penalty
rates for starting two hours earlier
than usual. The Council pointed out
the early start was normal in such a
situation to avoid the interruption of
traffic in St. Kilda Road. Then there
were others who felt it was normal in
such a situation to keep back the
aborealists, and to stop the splendid
chop-by-chop description on television.
The most moving of all, on the
scarred graveyard of the late departed
elms someone placed a wreath of
chrysanthemums. And considering the
state of the drought in Melbourne, a
bunch of chrysanthemums is no small
sacrifice.

Three fateful
days for
Paddo
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
CONFIDENTIALLY, ARCHITECT
Walter Bunning has already cased Pad-
dington. Quietly. On his own. But on
the third day of his inquiry into the
N.S.W. Department of Main Roads’
plans for Paddo he says he wants, as
Commissioner, to be seen publicly
examining the area. “I expect,” he
adds, in a throwaway tone, “there will
be quite a bit of Press coverage.”
Well, the turnout on that third day
is enough to make afternoon “Mirror”
columnist Ron Saw, who happens to
be motoring through at the time, brake
hard on a pedestrian crossing. His
piece, on events at Sydney Town Hall
the day before, consists largely of
imaginary conversations with a lady
who does not exist. Actually, Mr. Saw
says he couldn’t hear a bloody thing,
and no wonder. Acoustically, the Town
Hall has the loudest echoes this side of
Switzerland, also a staff of compulsive
whistlers and hammer-bangers, a steady
stream of frustrated operatic singers,
and a gentleman who plays the organ
whenever the whim takes. “Shall I,”
asks Mr. Bunning’s male secretary,
roughly at the point when Mr. Bun-
ning leans forward for the third time
through a bout of hammer-banging,
“shall I ask them to stop?”
Until the third day, when events
take a dramatic turn into the streets,
the inquiry jogs along in an informal
fashion Mr. Bunning’s not done this
sort of thing before.
There is, on Monday, a television
crew recording everyone’s famous first
words and movements, but neither
Walter Bunning nor Philip Jeffrey, QC,
retained at vast expense by the Pad-
dington Society, which is collecting
from residents to the tune of $l5OO,
are disturbed. Nothing, says Mr. Jef-
frey, disturbs him when he is absorbed.
On Mr. Bunning’s left beneath the
Lord Mayor’s canopied seat is a stenog-
rapher with drop earrings and cling-
some jersey two-piece, on his right his
male secretary, and next to him the
tape-recording man whose other job
is to see no one steals the equipment.
What people fancy, he says, are the
mikes. On Mr. Jeffrey’s right is Junior
Counsel Rod Meagher with a penchant
for cigars. The aroma mixes frightfully
with Paddingtonian ladies with a pen-

chant for French perfume. Poet, broad-
caster, and president of the Paddington
Society, John Thompson kicks off as
first witness against the road scheme.
Once he starts, says a neighbor who
shall not be named, he cannot stop.
On Tuesday there is a discussion of
Desire Lines, as applicable to traffic,
and the unexpected appearance of
Penny McDonnel from London in a
mini-Union Jack: she’s cut short her
hols to protest against the expressway,
it will go clean through her sitting-
room. Mr. Bunning returns from lunch
and finds the Council Chamber locked.
You never know, he says, what these
barristers are up to, but he’s glad
artist John Olsen’s coming because he’s
a good talker. Mr. Olsen, in off-white
suit, purple shirt, sees Paddo as another
lit le Paris, a Greenwich Village. A
Chelsea of the South Pacific? suggests
Mr. Jeffrey. Exactly.
Then,there’s George Warnecke, who,
among other things, is a member of
the Good Neighbor Council. Every-
one’s so friendly in Paddo: he once
said good morning to a woman walk-
ing along the street and she said did
she know him? No, he said, I just said
good morning. Well, she said, she’d
never had that happen to her before in
any other part of the world.
Next day there’s art-gallery owner
Rudy Komon en route for Fred Wil-
liams at the airport, who won’t be an
art-gallery owner if the road goes
through his frontage. Look, he says, to
do some name-dropping, Rockefeller,
Rothschild, Lord de l’lsle, Lady Casey,
Dr. Coombs regularly drop in. And
what, asks Mr. Jeffrey, will you do if
you lose your gallery? Mr. Komon will
revert to selling pictures from a car.
Can anyone see Rockefeller dropping
in there? Well, now, says Mr. Bunning,
we’ll have a cup of tea and then go on
to the inspection . . .
Sartorially they all stick out a mile.
Burtning’s bow-tie and trilby. Jeffrey’s
silk suit and stiff collar. Meagher’s
outsize white spotted tie. Thompson’s
in grey baggy tweeds, well, he is a
local: he’s told them not to fuss about
tidying up, you know, leave everything
as normal. So round they all go:
Bunning, instant Pied Piper of Paddo,
with cameramen, reporters, the whole
shebang, down basements, up base-
ments, round gardens, through kitchens,
drawing-rooms, no he won’t look at the
bathroom, thank you, making state-
ments, putting pertinent questions:
and did you, he asks the rich grand-
daughter of Cattle King Kidman in her
gracious, beautifully decorated resi-
dence, did you do all the scraping
yourself, Mrs. Lee?
At the very last house in Queen
Street, Mrs. Warnock is waiting. She
has to tell someone. She feels awful.
The other day she sprayed the birds
accidentally and they all fell down
dead on her lawn and on the gardens,
she feels like a murderer. She had
better, she says, tell Mr. Bunning not
to touch the trees . . .
The ABC man did say this story
would turn into something big.

One of Australia’s
missing parts
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
NOW THAT the Prime Minister has
rounded out his foreign policy state-
ments so that they have lost that elusive,
off-the-cuff quality that at first puzzled
not only Australians but also states-
men in neighboring countries, there is
one more bit of rounding out that he
should attend to at once. If the map
that Sir Robert Menzies put up in the
Cabinet room to remind himself that
Australia adjoined South-East Asia is
still there, all Mr. Gorton need do is
to go into the room and look at it.
The map shows that if Indonesia
looks to its immediate neighbors it finds
not only Singapore, Malaysia, and Aus-
tralia but also the Philippines. And
that if Malaysia looks to its immediate
neighbors it finds not only Singapore,
Indonesia, and Thailand but also
the Philippines. And that if Australia
looks at the huge archipelago of islands
that curves out from the Malay pen-
insula it finds not only Malaysia, Indon-
esia, and New Guinea but also the
Philippines.
Yet in his otherwise more coherent
references to foreign policy in his
speech to the electors of Higgins, Mr.
Gorton, when referring to Australia’s
neighbors, spoke of his desire to see a
closer association between Indonesia,
Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, and
Australia but he did not mention
the Philippines. And when, earlier this
month, Mr. Gorton announced, com-
mendably, that he hoped in April or
May to visit Indonesia, Singapore,
Malaysia, Thailand, South Vietnam,
and Japan, he did not say that he also
hoped to visit the Philippines.
It is not suggested that Mr. Gorton
has any bad faith toward the Philip-
pines, merely that in his imagination,
as in that of almost every Australian,
including most members of the External
Affairs Department, the Philippines
does not exist or, if it does exist, it is
somewhere “up there,” right out of the
region in which Australia has a special
interest.
Our special interest in Malaysia and
Singapore first came from the British
connection, and our special interest in
Indonesia from direct geographical con-
nection. It is a tribute to the lasting
influence of the old imperial maps,
cutting up South-East Asia into appen-
dages of colonial powers, that, despite
even Corregidor and Bataan and
despite the fact that it was from the
Philippines that MacArthur flew to Dar-
win in 1942 we do not even yet
automatically think of the Philippines
as being an important part of the mass
of Malay people who, together with
their immigrant Chinese communities,
constitute our immediate northern
environment.
This is a question that will solve
itself. If the present talk of regional co-
operation and security turns into prac-
tice the Philippines will have a more
natural place in it than Australia and
New Zealand, and by force of this
circumstance we will learn to take the
Philippines into account. But it might
be better if we showed some initiative,
not merely waiting for events to shove
us into line.
In any case, the Philippines has many
natural advantages for us as a nation
with which we should enjoy particularly
friendly relations. On the negative side
it does not represent a strategic de-
mand: it shelters more fully under the
wings of the American eagle than we
do. On the positive side, although with
distinctive national variations, its elites
have been affected by contact with
European civilisation for longer and
perhaps more deeply than many others.
While matters of strategy and of
economics tend to be on the agenda in
our relations with Indonesia, Singapore,
and Malaysia, with the Philippines our
main concern (although we can also be
of use to them in economic matters)
could be in the general business of
human contact. It is time that Aus-
tralia and New Zealand set up a body,
the purpose of which would be to
arrange greater artistic, intellectual,
scientific, and technological exchanges
with the four nations of the Malay
Archipelago, including the Philippines.
And for those of us who see it as a
necessary part of Australia’s destiny
that it should progress as an assimil-
atory and socially homogeneous society
of increasingly multi-racial origin, the
educated Filipinos seem an immediately
safer bet as immigrants than many
others. English-speaking, Christian, in
some ways “Americanised,” in some
ways “Mediterraneanised,” educated
Filipinos (and Filipinas) seem as likely
to “fit” into Australia as less educated
Spaniards, for example, or Turks.
The South-East Asia of colonial times
had no commonsense of itself. Just
as Australians looked to London (or
Dublin) and did not see “the Dutch
East Indies” (which was looking to The
Hague), so the Filipinos looked to New
York (or Madrid) and did not see any-
thing of importance around them. All
the nations of this area are now seeing
an importance in their relations be-
tween themselves. In the case of the
Philippines, they saw a sense of neigh-
borhood in us, before we became aware
of them. But this seems easy enough to
fix up. For a start, External Affairs
should add one more proper noun to its
rhetoric; and the Prime Minister, one
more destination to his trip.

COMMENT
BY.
PETER
SAMUEL
THE NATIONAL political dialogue is
taking an interesting new shape this
year. It appears that a powerful con-
vergence is occurring, with the leaders
of both the Liberal and Labor Parties
moving toward common middle
ground. Mr. Gorton is, by any defini-
tion, to the left of the late Mr. Holt,
despite all the nonsense which was
talked about him being hawkish and
on the lan Smith Right. He is clearly
far less interested in building a relation-
ship with the solidly non-communist
countries of Asia, less enamored of the
U.S., and more sceptical about our
Vietnam commitment. On domestic
affairs he is expressing greater concern
for social welfare and administrative
reform, and he has much more of the
planner’s sense of the need for deter-
mining priorities.
If the Liberal leadership has shifted
left, the Labor leadership (in Parlia-
ment at least) has shifted right. Mr.
Whitlam of 1968 is definitely to the
right of Mr. Whitlam of 1967,
especially as measured in foreign
policy. Taking the critical issue of
Vietnam as a measure, Mr. Whitlam
has moved ground significantly since
his South-East Asian visit. He still
makes gestures of obeisance to his Left
by pronouncing some of their silly
slogans: “We must try to end the kill-
ing and start the talking” (as if the
U.S. Administration has ever ceased
for a moment such attempts) and “The
trouble with South Vietnam is that it
has no one who fought the French”
(when the Vietnamese Embassy in
Canberra is staffed entirely by former
Viet Minh officers). But in matters of
substance Mr. Whitlam has now
thrown off the protesting Left almost
completely and developed a policy
which is quite plausible and defensible.
At his Sydney Press conference, and
his Higgins speech, Mr. Whitlam de-
veloped a distinctly new and realistic
line on Vietnam, the guts of which are
worth reproducing. The Government
of Vietnam headed by President Thieu
is now a properly elected Government
—“a very great demonstration of what
the South Vietnamese people can
achieve,” though it still has to gain the
support of all its people (like most
governments). Its performance is poor
because of inadequate pay; too great
a number of its able people, having
fled the war, are now living overseas;
and it has failed to attract people by
appeals to patriotism. From this sym-
pathetic and accurate assessment of the
non-communist weakness flows Mr.
Whitlam’s recommendation that far
higher priority needs be given to build-
ing up the Government of Vietnam.
This opens an area in which there
are plenty of telling criticisms of the
, r !j
Allied effort. Penny-pinching by the
Americans has left Vietnamese public
servants on abysmally low salaries, at
which all but the most saintly of men
would be drawn into crooked deals.
Vietnamese administrative procedures
and structures and the education system
have been badly neglected. Even the
tough, brave, and very competent units
of the Vietnamese Army are equipped
with obsolete, heavy, slow-firing rifles.
They have pitifully little helicopter or
artillery support.
No longer does Mr. Whitlam say
that the Allied effort should be con-
fined to a holding operation: “I have
never used the word confined. I believe
the emphasis should be switched from
attacking the North and trying to in-
sulate the country, to clearing and hold-
ing and building it.” That is very dif-
ferent from his previous 1967 calls in
line with the Adelaide Conference
decision —for a unilateral halt to the
bombing, and it is something which
makes a good deal of sense. The Ameri-
cans probably have devoted too great
a proportion of their resources to the
strategic insulation of South Vietnam,
and too little to rooting out the internal
sources of communist political support,
manpower, supplies, and the rest.
Asked about National Liberation
Front representation in a future govern-
ment, Mr. Whitlam said it was not for
outsiders to say what government the
South Vietnamese should have, by im-
plication rejecting the Adelaide Con-
ference formula which follows the com-
munist line in specifying a coalition
set-up as an objective.
This is all a very considerable shift
in Mr. Whitlam’s position, and it looks
as though he is going to stick to it as
official Labor Party policy. Prime Min-
ister Gorton obviously sees a threat in
this move toward a more tenable line
by the Leader of the Opposition, and
he was forced to resort to reading the
rules of the Labor Party at his Higgins
by-election speech. A comic turn for a
Prime Minister surely. But if Mr. Whit-
lam is not forced back to the Adelaide
ultimatum policy he will be able to
bring considerable pressure to bear on
the Government and open up the op-
portunity for a meaningful debate on
our role in Vietnam for the first
time.
It seems possible that this converg-
ence may proceed in domestic matters,
too. Mr. Gorton is obviously keen to
make movement in matters of national
development and social welfare, and
many of the frustrated public servants
and academics with ideas, who used to
feed them to Whitlam exclusively, may
see the opportunity to get things done
with Gorton the way they never could
with Holt or Menzies.

Getting more fat
off the land
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
IT IS NOT just wool and dairy farm-
ing that is in trouble; the whole rural
sector is facing a series of major prob-
lems. Almost everything is under fire:
wheat, dried fruits, sugar, the lot.
Devaluation and the Common Market,
the two current bogies, have simply
underlined the basic question we have
been ignoring for years: are we using
our laud to grow the right things; is
too much of what we grow no longer
what the world wants —or at least what
it can pay for?
It is impossible to believe that there
is no future for Australia’s exports of
some kind of food; we are close to
millions of starving people, and if the
Western world does not discover some
way of sharing its wealth with these
people so that they can buy food, then
the world is in for a disaster anyway.
But we have to decide what food we
should grow, not only for Asian
markets but for the rest of the world,
too.
Rural exports are not just falling as
a proportion of total exports as, in-
deed, they could be expected to do in
view of the massive increases in minerals
exports. They are falling in actual
value. And it is not a good enough
answer simply to blame recurring
droughts.
Even though the volume of rural ex-
ports is likely to be only slightly be-
low last year’s (because of considerable
carry-over stocks from a record season),
lower prices for many products will
bring a nine percent drop in their
value.
This season’s wool clip is expected
to rise by less than half of one percent
(as sheep numbers recover from the
1965-66 drought, but the average cut
per head falls a little). And world-
wide wool production looks like rising
by only about one percent. But this
is at a time when wool consumption
continues to be so weak that exporting
countries have had serious difficulty
getting rid of their produce; they held
stocks of wool at the beginning of the
current season three times larger than
at the beginning of 1966-67 and
larger than at any time for 20 years.
There seems little chance that con-
sumption will rise very sharply this year
following 1967’s slump, although some
recovery in demand is expected. Even
though Australian production continues
to be limited by a poor season, world
production is going to exceed world
demand by a considerable amount this/
year. So it is certain that the average
price of wool sold in Australia will fall
far below last season’s, which was not
too good, anyhow.
And look at wheat. Despite the
promise held out in the new Inter-
national Grains Agreement, prices have
fallen to belew those required when
the agreement comes into force next
July, and this is despite the fact that
Australia’s available wheat export sur-
plus has been slashed by drought as
production has been cut 40 percent
from last year’s record.
But even this year’s forecast output,
of 280 million bushels, will be about 20
million bushels better than the 1965-
66 drought year.
And, to make matters even worse
for wheat, the French (whose cost of
production is more than double ours)
are planning to use Common Market
subsidy payments to reduce their ex-
port price in some of our Asian markets.
Are these all temporary reverses? Or
are we on the wrong track? This is the
sort of question the present govern-
mental inquiry into the rural sector
must seriously face up to.
The time is now coming when we
may have to ask ourselves whether in-
ternational commodity agreements are
a viable solution to our rural problems;
given the fact that foreign countries
that subsidise their own growers and
then try to squeeze us are acting un-
fairly, can we really hope to stop them
doing so through international agree-
ments?
It looks as if the answer may turn
out to be that we will simply have to
be more adaptable to what the world
wants from us. Last decade it was wool,
but in the next decade it may well be
meat. The fact that we are good at pro-
ducing something does not mean we
should go on producing it for ever,
especially if there are no customers for
it.
So what the Government is doing in
dairying may have to be done in many
other industries that are running out
of customers.
But should there be a headlong
rush into cattle? That certainly seems
the easiest way of solving the dairy
problem, as the Government has at
last decided to do what experts have
been advising for years and encourage
smaller dairymen out of their peasant-
style industry.
But there are problems in meat, too,
although the meat industry is still Aus-
tralia’s third biggest earner of export
income. It is only because the U.S.
has suddenly begun to buy a lot more
from us that Australian exports look at
all healthy (apart from the marginal
benefits resulting from renewed British
interest in foot-and-mouth-free Aus-
tralian meat and a modest rise in
Japan’s quota-controlled intake).
But meat exports are a function of
price, and the shortage of cattle in Aus-
tralia resulting from the drought has
kept prices too high for most exporters
to make a go of it. A big build-up of
beasts could provide a massive export
stimulus in a protein-hungry world.


AUSTRALIA
A decision for dairying but
only an exercise for wool
WITH BOTH THE Australian Agri-
cultural Council and the Wool Industry
Conference meeting, it was a week in
which the primary industries dominated
the news from Canberra in a way they
have not managed for some time. So
far as the dairying industry was con-
cerned, it was a decisive week. For
the wool industry it was as indecisive
as ever.
Decision came for the dairying in-
dustry when Primary Industry Minister
Mr. Anthony asked the States at the
Agricultural Council meeting of State
Agricultural Ministers to co-operate in
a Commonwealth plan to restructure
the industry. They agreed. Yet after
years in which so many publicists have
urged this decision it went almost un-
noticed among other reports.
The Commonwealth can now start to
help the country’s 70,000 dairymen ad-
just to the market reality. There are
too many dairymen producing too
much butter at too high a price, and
that despite some would say en-
couraged by subsidies and discrimi-
natory pricing arrangements costing
Australians about $4O million a year,
about half the nation’s dairy farmers
continue to stay on farms earning less
than $2OOO a year.
This new move will particularly affect
the large proportion living in the shaly
country at the infertile ends of the
northern N.S.W. and southern Queens-
land rivers where the infertility of land,
combined with one of the most variable
climates in the world if it isn’t
drought it is flood produces a rough
R. L. Dennis (APPU), Sir William Gunn (Wool Board), and R. V. Sewell (Wool
and Meat Producers) at last week’s Wool Industry Conference meeting
grass which does little more to dairy-
cattle than keep them alive.
Now that he has the backing of the
State Agriculture Ministers, Mr.
Anthony will present to Federal Cabinet
a scheme for granting $3O million to
the States over a four-year period, to
deal with the problem of some of the
marginal dairy farms. Commonwealth
respect for State sovereignty will leave
the States to administer their own
schemes, but Canberra guidelines are
being laid down. One of the principal
uses to which the Commonwealth
money will be put is the writing-off of
milking sheds, yards, and farmhouses.
The $3O million will be enough to
write off the assets of about 2000 farms
at the very most. Eventually about
five times this number will have to go
as land is sold off to neighboring farm-
ers to increase their stock-carrying
capacity to a level at which they can
get a decent living for the purpose.
Five or six dairy farms may be com-
bined to make up beef cattle properties.
Others may be acquired for foresting.
The success of the scheme will de-
pend very much on the State Depart-
ments administering it, and the pres-
sure the Commonwealth is prepared to
put on recalcitrants. The N.S.W.
Liberal Government has been quite
active of its own accord in what it
describes as its dairy-farm “build-up”
policy. It remains true, however, that
the Lands Department valuations are
extremely conservative and some Can-
berra officials fear that consolidation
of farms may be hampered by unrealis-
tically low offers for land.
Queensland is the real worry. A
conservative Country Party Govern-
ment, backed by a nineteenth-century
Labor-appointed bureaucracy, is said
to be firmly rooted to theories of
peasant farming, and therefore most
reluctant to co-operate in modernisa-
tion.
The problem of undersized holdings
is not confined to dairying. Mr.
Anthony has stressed, and the Com-
monwealth Department is investigating,
the problem in other rural industries.
It applies even in the wool industry,
which is facing such stiff competition
from synthetics that Monash University
agricultural economist Fred Gruen said
last week that, after a study of syn-
thetic potential involving visits to the
U.S. and Europe, he was more pessi-
mistic than ever about wool. He said
that current costs in synthetic produc-
tion are low enough to allow a 50 per-
cent drop in prices with increased com-
petition, and a lesser need for huge
promotional expenditures, while tech-
nological advances also looked like
bringing* further economies to the
manufacture, of synthetics. Gruen pre-
dicted synthetic prices in the range 40


to 65c in the U.S., which would mean
that if clean wool was forced down to
about 75c U.S. as a result Australian
woolgrowers would not get much more
than 35c Australian for their greasy
wool in store at Australian ports, com-
pared with the current price of 45c
(which is depressingly low, anyway).
Graziers’ Association economist Mr.
G. Chislett came back at Gruen’s pro-
jections as far too gloomy. He said
he didn’t believe that synthetics prices
would fall nearly as far as Gruen pre-
dicted. Synthetics producers would
want to maintain profit margins and
they would find a way to do so. In
addition, Chislett pointed out, syn-
thetics firms the world over have a
strong vested interest in undermining
confidence in wool, because this is the
way to deter investment in improved-
productivity woolgrowing. They there-
fore exaggerated the opportunities
which exist for rapid price reductions
in synthetics, to try to depress wool-
growers into thinking that the game was
up.
However, last week showed that the
future of wool is still clouded by the
absolute obsession of the Australian
Wool Board with price fluctuations and
with various complicated schemes sup-
posed to smooth them out to the
neglect of fundamental cost and effici-
ency problems. Having been defeated
overwhelmingly in a grower referendum
on a proposal for a reserve price
authority to attempt to put an annual
floor on wool prices, the Australian
Wool Board devoted itself last week to
pushing its ill-defined scheme for
“supply management.”
Meeting in Canberra, the 70 leaders
of the wool industry who form the
so-called Wool Industry Conference
spent the best part of three days talk-
ing about the Wool Board’s scheme.
This proved to be expressed in such
woolly language in its marketing com-
mittee’s report that much of the time
was taken up in arguments about what
the Wool Board really meant. After
a windy session on Thursday morning,
during which dictionaries were brought
in to try to clarify semantic differences,
the Conference agreed to accept a Board
definition of what it meant by “supply
management.”
The definition consisted of three
clauses:
• Wool which did not achieve a “satis-
factory price” in “relation to the most
recent market levels” would be passed
in unsold.
• Quantities rostered for sale would be
varied “as may be considered desirable
from time to time.”
• However, there should be “no stock-
piling.”
This left unresolved key questions
such as: who would determine the ques-
tion of whether prices being offered
were satisfactory? And who would con-
trol rostering? (The Board wanted two
new organisations set up to decide these
things: a wool-marketing authority and
a wool-selling organisation.) And it
contained an astonishing internal in-
consistency. If wool was to be passed in
unsold and if rosters were to place for
sale less than the full quantity of wool
coming in from the shearing sbeds, then
how could there be no stockpiling?
Facetiously perhaps, but with some
justification, some delegates asked
whether the Board proposed to burn
the stuff?
It appears, in fact, that the Board is
retreating as fast as it can move back-
wards with dignity. The Board has no
coherent proposal for improved market-
ing and increasing numbers of wool-
growers are coming to suspect that the
exercise is mainly one of bureaucratic
empire-building.
The Conference in Canberra last
week accepted hardly a single clause in
the Wool Board’s proposals, referring
them back for further investigation, for
report to a conference in June. Board
members made little effort to defend
their original proposals. They appeared
happy to win ground for retreat.
The Cabinet
Shuffling toward
an anti-climax
THE CURRENT speculation in Can-
berra is that Mr. Gorton’s long-delayed
ministerial reshuffle is going to be some-
thing of an anti-climax. All sorts of
reasons why the weaker members of
the present team cannot be removed
are appearing. Territories Minister
Barnes and Repatriation Minister Me-
Kellar will only be sacked if Mr. Mc-
Ewen gives Mr. Gorton the nod, and
it seems most unlikely that he has done
this.
Mr. Fairbairn in National Develop-
ment is such a personal friend of Mr.
Gorton one of the most frequent
visitors to the Gorton house at Nar-
rabundah that his removal is in-
conceivable. Mr. Chipp, despite his
blunders and open campaigning against
Mr. Gorton in the leadership struggle,
is likely to stay if only because of
the imminence of the report of the
Royal Commission on the Voyager
affair. The report is understood to
vindicate the Government, if not com-
pletely the Naval Board, but the re-
moval of the Navy Minister would
hardly smooth its public acceptance.
The insider wits are saying that Air
Minister Howson would definitely go
but for the fact that he has an excellent
swimming-pool in his Canberra house,
one which Mr. Gorton has used regu-
larly over the years. They point out
that the Prime Minister still hasn’t
got a pool of his own Mr. Holt
had plans for one at the Lodge early
on in his term, but had them cancelled
and that this gives Mr. Howson
something of advantage in Government.
This leaves Mr. Freeth, Minister for
Shipping and Transport, as the only
obvious ministerial expellee. Mr.
Fraser, the present Army Minister, is
taking Mr. Gorton’s former Education
portfolio, leaving Army to be filled -
with Mr. Tom Hughes firm favorite
for the job. One or two other vacancies
might be created by new Departments.
Of these, the new Department of Abo-
riginal Affairs will probably go to Mr.
W. C. Wentworth.
There are plenty of Gorton lobbyists
awaiting their rewards. But most of
them will be disappointed.
Prime Minister Gorton speaking in Higgins last week


Medical Benefits
Dr. Forbes'dilemma
Dr Forbes . . . much maligned.
“I’M REALLY sorry for Harold these
days. You journalists all writing up
Gorton’s proposals as if they were
something fresh and new and his own
bright idea. His one sparkling inno-
vation he pinched off Harold.” So
commented a Whitlam staff-man in
Canberra last week.
He was referring to Mr. Gorton’s
proposal for Commonwealth aid to
cover people suffering from chronic ill-
ness. The record certainly shows that
the late Mr. Holt promised the same
scheme. Speaking in the Senate elec-
tion campaign in November last year,
he said: “We know we have not prop-
erly covered the emergency of long ill-
ness. There is anxiety about this, par-
ticularly in old people. Here is another
area of genuine human need which will
take a high priority in our thinking.”
In fact, it wasn’t a Holt original
either, but seems to have been a pet.
project of the much-maligned Minister
for Health, Dr. Forbes, and his Depart-
ment. In concrete form, the proposal
was first worked out last May, and it
was one of several which Dr. Forbes
put to Cabinet at the time of depart-
mental Budget submissions. He had
asked his Department at the beginning
of the year to prepare a comprehensive
review of health services with a view
to developing proposals to fill gaps in
the structure of health services. Only
one scheme—provision "of free hearing
aids for pensioners, costing $190,000 —
got through Cabinet. A scheme for
people with long-continuing illnesses
(barred from Medical Benefits funds)
was thrown out, along with two other
projects.
Whatever its history, Mr. Gorton’s
promise to act on it means one thing:
that Dr. Forbes will stay on in the
Ministry. As a politician, Forbes is his
own worst enemy. Fie won’t do the
normal things Ministers do to make
sure the world knows of their acti-
vities. He gives an old-fashioned re-
sponse to what a Minister should do
when faced with the dilemmas of Cab-
inet and ministerial responsibility, to
the extent of taking knocks he does
not really deserve. Boots and cheese
were two things which have made him
something of a laughing-stock. The
Army boots which rotted in Vietnam
were really the responsibility of the
Minister for Supply, but as Minister
for the Army he stoically took the
blame. The farcical ban on foreign
cheeses was the result of a mistake
by an official who gave a disastrously
wrong “yes” answer to the query about
whether the trade implications had
been investigated. They hadn’t, so Mr.
McEwen and his Department tipped
a bucket on Dr. Forbes when the ban
was announced. Dr. Forbes unlike
Mr. Howson in the VIP affair
refused to put the blame on the official
who had let him down.
In any case, Forbes had to his credit
a number of successes in his two years
of being Minister for Health. Nothing
spectacular, but then the Government
under Mr. Holt had given extensions
of health services a rather low priority
in its budgeting. Forbes has success-
fully bullied a reluctant Australian
Medical Association to accept 40,000
extra pensioners on the free list a
delicate operation, given the Common-
wealth’s lack of constitutional power
—and he has taken a tough line with
other interest groups on several occa-
sions. The proposal to produce hear-
ing-aids in Government factories
aroused great backbench lobbying
against him.
The drug companies have promoted
campaigns against him, too, for his
efforts to reduce prices on drugs bought
for the Pharmaceutical Benefits list and
for his Bill to streamline drug control.
He has survived those assaults.
The administration
A new technique
REVOLUTIONS JUST DON’T
happen in Government bureaucracies,
and Canberra’s is no exception. But
the nearest thing to a revolution could
be wrought by a new management tech-
nique called program budgeting. It is
currently the “in” word among the
more innovative of the capital’s public
servants.
Program budgeting is a new account-
ing system planning technique
which provides the basis for more
effective use of the taxpayer’s money.
An adaptation of the best commercial
management techniques, it was most
fully implemented in the U.S. Defence
Department after Mr. McNamara went
there from Ford, but now it is being
generally applied by the Federal Gov-
ernments of the United States and
Canada throughout their public ser-
vices*
In July last year, The Bulletin, in-
terested in how far the Australian Gov-
ernment machine was investigating pro-
gram budgeting, found that nothing
whatever was stirring.
Mention of the phrase was greeted
with expressions of incomprehension.
None of the three main internal Gov-
ernment libraries, including those of
the Treasury Department and the Public
Service Board, had the basic texts of
the subject. Now, however, things are
moving. Treasury has an officer over-
seas studying the system, the Public
Service Board is running seminars on
it, and at least six Departments are get-
ting genned up on the subject. Reader
in Public Finance at the Australian
National University, Mr. W. Jay, says
the number of enquiries from Depart-
ments in the past few months has been
“staggering.” The U.S. and Canadian
Embassy information sections have
been kept busy acquiring books and
papers from Washington and Ottawa.
The present system of annual de-
partmental budgeting is riddled with
deficiencies which program budgeting
is designed to overcome. Instead of bas-
ing Government accounts simply on a
departmental classification, it starts by
dividing Government expenditures by
discrete programs, defined in terms of
various objectives of Government policy.
Rather than detailing the running costs
of the Department of Primary Industry
and the loan allocation to the Depart-
ment of Works, it comes up with a
broad objective, say, primary industry
assistance and, within this head, lumps
together the operations of the Depart-
ment of Primary Industry in formulat-
ing agricultural policy, the agricultural
subsidies from Treasury, the agricul-
tural research work of CSIRO, the
dams provided by the Department of
Works, grants to States for helping
agriculture, and the beef roads of the
Department of National Development.
It collects together the activities of
different agencies so that senior public
servants, members of Cabinet and
Parliament, and the public are able to
get a picture of how Government re-
sources are being allocated by broad
objectives. Thus the wood of actual
Government activities can be distin-
guished from the departmental trees.
At its broadest, a program budget
for the Commonwealth would be
framed this way:
The Government framework
Governor-General and State cere-
monial activities and structures.
Parliament and parliamentarians.
Justice courts and the Government’s
legal advice.
Financial management: tax collection,
governmental audits, mi ting.
Personnel management: selection,
promotion, training of public servants.
Economic development
Immigration: Government advice
and administration, publicity, transport,
hostelling, counselling.


Primary industry assistance: (as out-
lined above).
Secondary industry assistance: tariff
administration, subsidies, research in
manufacturing, productivity, promo-
tion.
Transport: roads, railways, harbors,
airports, air control.
Power: hydro-electric dams, oil
search subsidies, atomic energy re-
search. .asJ
Labor mobility and retraining.
Minerals development: geological
survey facilities for minerals com-
panies.
Water control: irrigation, city sup-
plies, flood prevention.
Export promotion, subsidies, Trade
Commissioner services.
Social development and welfare
Health. Education. Arbitration.
Housing. Assistance to culture. Welfare
payments and administration. Abori-
gines’ problems.
External relations
Military defence. Diplomatic ser-
vices. Foreign aid. Overseas territories.
Within these categories all expendi-
tures would be lumped together, re-
gardless of whether they were financed
from revenue or loans, whether current
or capital in nature, whether dis-
pensed through one department or an-
other or through a State Government
or a statutory corporation. The present
Budget accounts are designed solely for
stewardship and organisational account-
ability. Program budgeting firstly pro-
vides concise information about what
the Government is doing with the re-
sources available to it. It therefore
facilitates dialogue about national
priorities.
At a second stage it requires depart-
ments to divide their activities into
sub-programs geared to make their
separate contribution to the overall
program objective. Education might
therefore be subdivided into functions
(primary, secondary, technical, uni-
versity) and projects (Asian studies,
physical sciences, applied sciences, Eng-
lish language, etc.) and institutions
(libraries, universities, teacher training,
etc.).
In each case the administering agency
would be expected to develop a time-
phased plan showing the expected total
costs in manpower, buildings, materials,
and finance year by year for three to
five years, with perspective projections
ten years hence, in order to fulfil a
defined program. Where possible,
quantitative measures of performance
in fulfilling the program would be
provided. Thus in the program for im-
migration the administering Depart-
ment would tentatively project immi-
gration numb targets five years ahead
(in the absence of more specific Gov-
ernment policy it would assume the
constancy of the target), estimate the
manpower and financial needs of
attracting and processing immigrants
on the basis of measures, like cost per
immigrant landed, and a phased plan
for providing immigrant accommo-
dation and improving counselling. Such
long-term plans would be subject to
revision whenever there seemed a need
for altering national priorities, when-
ever the assumptions changed, or when-
ever the opportunity for achieving the
program objective more cheaply be-
came apparent.
Under annual departmental budget-
ing, existing monetary allocations are
taken for granted and rarely scrutinised.
Almost all the scrutiny is on the re-
quests for an increase in funds beyond
the amount provided in the previous
financial year. New ventures are ap-
proached over-critically, while old
schemes get along virtually unexamined.
Program budgeting aims to force Gov-
ernment agencies to justify not only
their new ventures but their old ones,
too. And it aims to give the new ven-
ture a chance to compete on an equal
footing with the old.
And by forcing them to make some
estimates of the complete costs over a
period of years, it forces program man-
agers to provide some insights into the
financial and manpower implications
for the future of embarking on their
particular programs. Finally, the
program approach to budgeting is usu-
ally a pre-requisite to applying more
specialised management techniques to
Government cost-benefit or cost-
effectiveness evaluation, systems
analysis, and so on.
CSIRO last year made the first steps
toward reorganising its activities
according to program budgeting tech-
niques. The Australian Universities
Commission’s three year projections
incorporate many of the elements of
program budgeting, and the Common-
wealth Department of Works has made
some efforts to adopt %its planning
aspect. But so far, beyond these three
agencies, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment works by the improvisational,
confused series of winter-season
wrangles for annual Budget money.
Waste, inefficiency, and inflexibility are
inevitable.
The emergence of a Prime Minister
who talks about the importance of
economic development and seems to
have an instinctive feel of efficiency and
a clear sense of the need to define
priorities is giving the reformers in
Government hope and inspiration. If
Mr. Gorton has not yet received sub-
missions on the subject of program
budgeting, he soon will.
The Opera House
Final stage
NOTHING WORTH WHILE has been
done in the Sydney Opera House in
two years since Joern Utzon resigned,
said Mrs. Elizabeth Price, of Double
Bay, in a $lBO4 full-page advertisement
Hughes ... no final estimate
in the “Sydney Morning Herald” call-
ing a meeting last Monday “to con-
sider the present situation on the Opera
House and future alternatives, to hear
Utzon’s dramatic tape-recorded offer
to return, and to vote for his recall as
‘controlling architect.’ ” About 3000
attended.
Within the week, the N.S.W. Min-
ister for Public Works, Mr. Davis
Hughes said that work on the final
stage of the Opera House would begin
in six weeks and should be completed
by 1971. The problems of glass closures
and louvre walls to the shells, left un-
solved, Hughes said, by Utzon (whom,
he added, he would not have back in
any circumstances) have now been
satisfactorily worked out, with steel
mullions hanging from the ribs to hold
the glass and with bronze-clad louvre
walls, backed by cement, closing the
gaps between the shells.
But while the solution of these highly
technical problems is probably bringing
more satisfaction to the architects (and
more fury to those who say Utzon
would have done things better) the most
important news for potential customers-
was that the concert-hall design has
now been completed and tested by
acoustical consultant Dr. Jordan, and
needs merely some easily attainable
modifications. “For the first time since
work on the Opera House began in
1959,” said Hughes, “we have a design
for the construction of the hall which
we know is feasible and we will have
a reliable estimate of costs in July be-
fore construction work on that parti-
cular phase begins.”
Inside the hall, to hold 2800, there
will be the same sort of aisle-less con-
tinental seating that Utzon wanted, but
the seats, wool upholstered, and with
continuous plywood backs, will be from
44 to 36 inches apart, a significant in-
crease. The ceiling, source of so much
controversy under Utzon, will now be of
plaster instead of plywood. Plywood
will be used for the walls.
Work is to begin on the base and

seating platforms of the concert hall
in July, when Dr. Jordan is to com-
plete his final acoustic tests on the
ceiling design in the one-tenth scale
model in which he has been doing
his testing, and work will begin on
the 1500 seat opera hall (the pit of
which is being increased to cope with
65 to 80 players) in October.
But there are still no estimates of
the final cost of the whole Opera House
(plus the four-level, 1000-vehicle car
park to be dug out below the fore-
court), “perhaps by the end of the
year we may have some overall idea,”
Hughes said.
One reason for this uncertainty is
the unresolved amount of structural re-
design necessary to strengthen some of
the podium and broadwalk supports, be-
cause loads now being imposed are far
greater than originally thought; the
podium had been designed before plans
had been prepared for the super-
structure to go on top of it. But the
completion date of some time in 1971
takes this work into account.
Arbitration Commission
Frustrations
THOUGH MOST of the nation’s
metal workers were making or threat-
ening strike and the contending parties
were caught up in the head of advocacy
before him, the president of the Arbi-
tration Commission, Sir Richard Kirby,
was excused for rising for the luncheon
adjournment a few minutes early dur-
ing the Full Bench hearing last Thurs-
day. By something less than coinci-
dence, Sir Richard’s two-year-old bay
•colt was racing in the 12.40 Maiden
Handicap at Ballarat.
The fact that it came from two and
a half lengths behind at the furlong
to win some tidy awards for those
patrons of the Commission who were
in the know was less remarked upon
than was the name of the colt: “Walk
the Plank,” by the imported sire Court
Sentence out of Marie Celeste. With
penal clauses being widely invoked and
the Arbitration Commission at least
out on a limb, the name seemed more
than appropriate.
What Sir Richard and his bench of
Judges, Moore and Gallagher, and
Commissioners, Winter and Taylor, had
to announce this week was a formula
which resolved the disputes created by
last December’s Metal Trades work-
value decision of Justice Gallagher and
Mr. Winter. And that task was pro-
foundly more difficult than winning a
Maiden at Ballarat.
The essence of the problem lies in
the word “absorption.” The Metal
Trades employers have claimed that the
December judgment indicates a duty
of the employers to absorb the increases
.granted by lowering or eliminating
over-award payments. The unions
•claim that this attack on over-award
payments robs the increases of sub-
stance and is against the spirit of the
Gallagher-Winter decision. Both cases
are exaggerated and can only be main-
tained because of the ambiguities con-
tained in the December judgment.
The union case is the weaker, but
the strength and unanimity of unions’
protests, the hundreds of strikes, stop-
pages, go-slow and work-to-regulations
campaigns indicate a dissatisfaction
which goes beyond the boundaries of
the recent arbitration struggle. In
simple terms it may be said that a
lot of skilled workers have the
abdominal feeling that they are not
getting their share of the cake. Four
factors have led to their discomfort
and militancy:
The persistent idea that though
profits seem to be rising the distinction
between real and money gains does not
concern them there is not enough
feed-back to the workers: the growing
notion that overseas capital interests
are carrying off too much loot in the
form of Australian minerals: the public
spectacle of great profits being made
through the Stock Exchanges in the
“mineral boom”: the conviction as
instanced in a recent Gallup Poll
that after a period of improvement the
lot of the average workers has deterior-
ated in the past couple of years.
The Gallup Poll found that for the
first time in many years more people
think their economic position is getting
worse rather than better; and this at
the same time as they are being told
by national leaders that Australia has
never been more prosperous and
wealthy.
For these reasons, union leaders have
been able to mount powerful strike
campaigns, as in the metal stoppages,
where 100,000 men have been involved,
and another 200,000 may be, and in the
postal strike, and in last week’s strike
of white-collar and skilled technical
staff in the Victorian Electricity Com-
mission.
Underneath the frustrations of the
rank-and-file lie the plans and opera-
tions of the Left-wing cadres who are
working for a national stoppage in-
volving all of the major industry groups
from metals to meat trades, and for
the discrediting of the Right and Centre
alliance of men such as Monk, Jordan,
and Harradine on the ACTU.
The plans of the Left are to replace
Monk with Hawke, and either to win
majority control of the ACTU execu-
tive, or to bypass it and temporarily
prove its impotence by leading large
strikes through outside agencies such
as the Metal Trades and other Left-
wing or Communist-led federations.
The irony was that a carelessly
thought-out Arbitration Commission
judgment in December so much mis-
understood the mood of the workers
and their leaders that the authority of
the Commission could be threatened
and its existence questioned. Whether
from the plank, down from the limb,
or off the hook —Sir Richard and his
Bench had to move fast and carefully
this week.


The Catholic Bishops:
New faces, new challenges
Bishops Thomas McCabe (Wollongong, left) and Francis Henschke (Wagga), two of Australia’s 35 Catholic bishops
IF REAL and lasting change is to
come to the Catholic Church in the
wake of Vatican 11, it will have to be
generated by the bishops. No matter
how much power shifts and ideas
develop, no matter how turbulent, or
at least slightly agitated, are priests,
no matter how intent on a new role
is the laity, the greatest power and per-
suasion still rest with the bishops.
In Australia since the Council got
under way there have been many
changes among Australia’s 35 bishops, if
not so far much change. Three capi-
tals, Canberra, Melbourne, and Bris-
bane, have new incumbents. Mel-
bourne, in Archbishop James Knox,
last year finally got a permanent suc-
cessor to Archbishop Mannix, after
Archbishop Simonds, plagued by ill-
ness, resigned at the age of 76. Arch-
bishop Eris O’Brien retired at 72 in
Canberra, but although, in a fairly
daring move, priests in the diocese
petitioned the Apostolic Delegate for
a say in the new appointment, Arch-
bishop Thomas Cahill got the job with-
out any help from the priests now
under his control. Archbishop Patrick
Mary O’Donnell of Brisbane is con-
siderably younger than his predecessor,
Archbishop James Duhig, who was 94
when he died, but is nonetheless only
four years off the Pope’s recommended
retiring age of 75.
Bishop Hugh Ryan of Townsville
last year accepted the Pope’s recom-
mendation and retired at 79. He was
succeeded by Bishop Leonard Faulkner,
who is 40. There have been other
younger appointments. Archbishop
Knox, at 53, is comparatively young
for the job. The new auxiliary at
Wagga, Bishop Francis Carroll, is 37.
However, in the Roman Catholic
Church, as elsewhere, youth is not the
absolute guarantee of an open mind or
of forward thinking that it is some-
times taken to be.
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
The first contact Catholics have with
their bishop is usually at twelve or
thirteen years of age, when he anoints
them with consecrated oil, chrism, and
taps their cheeks during the ceremonies
of the sacrament of Confirmation. The
sacrament is designed to bestow more
fully the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit:
wisdom, understanding, counsel, forti-
tude, knowledge, piety, and fear of
the Lord.
Thje Church also says that it makes
the receiver a soldier of Christ, and
just in time, because many bishops
immediately lay siege to the newly
granted understanding of the children
with sermons of considerable duration:
Archbishop Mannix commonly went oil
for two or three hours.
The effects of the sacrament are not
measurable, but the sermon often seems
to leave memorable imprints on body
and mind; mementoes which serve some
episcopal purpose, since most Catholics
never get close to a bishop again, in
this life at least. The situation never
seems to have bothered the vast body
of the Australian faithful who act on
the assumption that what they don’t ex-
perience won’t hurt them, but to some
of the younger reformers and the post-
Vatican II clergy the lack of communi-
cation between shepherds and flock is
deplored, and has even been called a
“scandal.”
That bishops are administrators in-
stead of pastors is the attack frequently
launched from the Australian Catholic
underground movements; it is followed
up with metaphorical complaints liken-
ing the bishops to managing directors
or first-division civil servants or even
medieval lords. The first issue of the
Melbourne “Catholic Worker” for this
year speaks with acerbity in an editor-
ial column, “Authority in the Church.”
“To multitudes of Catholics Roman
Catholicism has been, among other
things, a religion of fear. In particular,


authoritarian administration of the
Church in a diocese or in a religious
order has come to be generally
accepted.
“It is regrettable that the spirit of
Vatican II has not affected this situa-
tion in some feudal parts of Aus-
tralia. There are still bishops who treat
mature Catholics as less than adults
entitled to freedom of speech, even
when ‘faith and morals’ are not in-
volved . . . arbitrary exercise of
authority by a bishop is an occupational
hazard that must be faced . . .”
The criticism here is that the bishops
administer things in an authoritarian
way. The point might have been made
that bishops who see themselves prim-
arily as administrators, whether of
church ritual, property, or consciences,
are almost bound to err on the side of
authoritarianism. Pastors must be con-
cerned with things of the spirit, with
freedom and growth, and with pointing
the way, and may take for their motto:
“You shall know the truth and the
truth shall set you free.” Adminis-
trators must obviously be more con-
cerned with order and good form, with
uniformity and regulation, with dis-
cipline and the promotion of the
material interests of the church.
A recent visitor to Australia, Father
Harry Haas, of the Netherlands, who
startled conservative Catholics in his
appearance on “Four Corners,” ex-
pressed his reaction this way: “What
struck me time and again during my
stay in Australia was the primary
reaction, both among clergy and laity,
on legalistic lines: ‘Have you got per-
mission?’ I have no objection to obed-
ience, but I do think it is guided by
reason, courage, and initiative, as well
as prudence, if it is to be a virtue . . .
In civil life the Australian impresses
a visitor by his rational attitudes, tol-
erance, and initiative. In his Catholic
life he does not always give the same
impression . .
Such charges do not make much im-
pact on men like His Eminence Norman
Thomas Gilroy, Archbishop of Syd-
ney; created and proclaimed Cardinal
of the Holy Roman Church of the Title
of the Four Crowned Martyrs in 1946
and 72 years of age on January 22.
So far as the Cardinal is concerned
the danger for the laity is that it may
be tempted to “intrude its opinions and
concerns into those areas which are
truly episcopal”; priests ought to re-
member vows of obedience to the
Bishop; students in seminaries ought
to study up and shut up; but new
things may be thought and done if
they are prompted by Rome.
The trouble is that some imprudent
people want to “rush ahead of the
mind of the Church.” Last year there
was a minor revolt among some of
the young men training to be priests
at Manly seminary. For some time
priests influenced by the spirit of inquiry
which flowed through the Vatican
Council have been making awkward
statements and forming awkward com-
mittees. The number of clergy becom-
ing laicised is not large, but it is
growing. The number of seminarians
who do not complete the course is
so high that the Archdiocese of Syd-
ney faces a serious shortage of priests;
some seem to be leaving the seminaries
because they cannot see themselves
ministering with sufficient freedom if
they place themselves under the
authority of the See of Sydney.
These developments have been com-
prehended as manifestations of rank
ingratitude by the Cardinal’s “Curia”
of bishops and monsignori. The Car-
dinal, they say, took over the Arch-
diocese when it was administratively
run down and near financial ruin and
has spent his life’s energies in con-
structing efficient machinery of Church
government through which buildings
are erected, bills paid, letters answered,
priests supervised, and the full range
of sacraments and rituals are available
to the laity.
Cardinal Gilroy opens all his mail
Cardmal Gilroy . . . the dilemma of
keeping the liberals under control
personally. He also has to care for
nearly 200 parishes, 250 churches, 750
priests, nearly 4000 religious brothers
and sisters, 350 schools, and a Catholic
population of 634,000.
And for the progressives the sup-
porters of the Cardinal can point -to
his prompt attention to changes in
ritual and ceremonies recommended by
the Vatican Council, and his warm
response to -the new Catholic mood
of ecumenism, as seen in his presence
at St. Andrew’s Anglican Cathedral
for the enthronement of Archbishop
Loane.
The Cardinal’s problems dilemmas
perhaps are common to most of
the Australian hierarchy: to conserve
what they regard as essential faith and
morals; to keep the visible structures
and appurtenances of authority strong;
to allow such changes as the Vatican
suggests; to keep the new liberal laity
and clergy under firm control without
producing a reaction which drives them
outside of the official church.
“The task must in some ways be
beyond them,” says a Jesuit priest. “A
lot of the bishops were educated at
Propaganda College, which is just
about the most conservative in Rome.
When they come back they usually
serve as secretaries or some kind of
employees of existing bishops. They are
mostly conservative administrators or
diplomats, and now the clamor is that
they suddenly become liberal theologi-
ans and Christ-like pastors and even
freedom-riders.”
At least part of the description fits
the new head of the Melbourne Arch-
diocese, Archbishop James Knox, who
went from Catholic schools and semi-
nary in Western Australia to Propa-
ganda College, Rome, where he was
ordained in 1941. After winning doctor-
ates in Sacred Theology and Canon
Law, he became Vice-Rector of Propa-
ganda College and later served in the
Vatican diplomatic service in Rome,
Japan, Africa, and India before taking
up his Australian appointment last year.
A background in Propaganda College
and the Vatican Secretariat of State
seems a rather ominous one to Mel-
bourne’s liberal Catholics. A statement
Archbishop Knox made in New Delhi
shortly .before he left India gave them
some hope that here might be a man
of fresh judgment: “Hindus have an
impressively profound religious sense—
something which is not so prevalent
in many other parts of the world,” he
said, and added some sharp references
to “head-counting” kinds of missionary
work.
However, since his arrival the new
Archbishop has mainly concerned him-
self with the rundown administrative
machinery of the Archdiocese. He has
been called a quiet, shy man, but there
are signs of a fiercer temperament lurk-
ing under the mitre. When the president
of a university Catholic group in a
dinner-table address suggested that the
bishops had been a bit apathetic toward
the universities and their interest would
be welcomed the latter a dubious
proposition—Archbishop Knox paid for-
mal thanks for the invitation and then
curtly deplored what he regarded as an
attack on his fellow bishops and pre-
decessors.
There is nothing to suggest that
Archbishop Knox would have been in
the least unhappy with the concerns
and priorities expressed in the joint
statement of the Australian hierarchy
on “immorality” issued some months
ago. Archbishop Knox is on record as
saying that if “Hindu women adopted
the Christian pattern of behaviour
there was no reason why India could
not be self-supporting and poverty be
diminished,” which seems a very long-
range solution to pressing problems.
The bishops’ statement represented
some of the central concerns of the
bishops. Part of it reads:
“We deplore the notable increase in
the divorce rate in Australia during the


past few years . . . Already we are
witnessing an alarming fall in our birth-
rate . . . while this is happening and
while the sales of the so-called ‘birth-
control pill’ have risen sharply we are
spending millions of dollars in bringing
migrants to Australia ... we can be
pardoned for thinking that our own
Australian-born children are our best
future citizens . . .
“Marital infidelity, which so often
precedes the seeking of a divorce or
separation, is regarded too lightly and
not as the serious sin it really is . . .
modern society gives little help to
people, young or old, to value or to
try to preserve chastity . . . pre-nuptial
sins (my italics) are termed ‘experi-
ences’ or other attractive names and are
tolerated by many, deliberately encour-
aged by others.”
The statement puts an emphasis on
“sin” as almost an additional quality
of immoral acts quite apart from their
personal and social consequences, an
emphasis which is entirely foreign to
recent Catholic theological formula-
tions. There may seem to be a tone
in the statement which indicates that
the objection is not only to the pain
inflicted on society but also to the
pleasure gained by the non-virtuous.
Possibly the real fear behind the
statement is of the disorder in human
relationships which undisciplined
actions bring. Certain words occur and
recur in the statements and sermons of
Australian bishops, and those of simi-
lar antecedents: words like “harmony,”
“order,” “preserve,” “standards,”
“tradition.” They are the words of
ledger-keepers and law-enforcers more
than adventurers and martyrs.
“One of the things which stops them
from being pastoral in the Gospel
sense of the term,” says another mem-
ber of the Jesuit order, “is the disease
to which bishops are especially prone:
loss of the power and desire to listen.
They become too accustomed to tell-
ing and they often miss what is going
on. In times of change this can be
dangerous.”
The failing, if it exists, is, of course,
one of the occupational hazards of busy
men whose days are spent more in
signing documents and laying down
procedures than in communal work or
conversation. And the. workload of
bishops in cities the size of the Aus-
tralian capitals is severe by any test:
marriages to annul, priests to ordain,
meetings to address, foundation stones
to lay, money to raise, Confirmations
to be administered, Masses to be
offered, visiting notables to be enter-
tained, and all manner of rules and
regulations to be enforced. The week
of a bishop is probably busier than
that of the managing director of BHP
or of most Cabinet ministers.
There is not much time for listen-
ing one or two bishops use a kind
of clerical espionage service to do some
watching for them, but that is not
quite the same thing, although the
stirrings and murmurings of some of
the younger laity and clergy might
repay a hearing. While a bishop is
referring to his Canon Law to solve
some question of clerical litigation, he
is probably not aware that a group of
Catholics are meeting somewhere in
his diocese to discuss whether the insti-
tutional Church is really necessary any
more, or whether the Sacraments have
more than symbolic value or whether
it is worth remaining in the Church
if you don’t accept literally the
Church’s teaching on the divinity of
Christ.
“Well, there’s Young in Hobart,” is
the reply one gets to the question:
are there any bishops who appear to
be in sympathy with the new spirit of
liberality of the Church in Northern
Europe? It is related as evidence that
Archbishop Young was the only Aus-
tralian bishop to attend the extra
theological briefing sessions which were
run as a supplement to Vatican II; and
last year he presided over the election
of sixteen priests to a senate of clergy
which will share in the episcopal
powers and functions in Hobart.
Archbishop Guilford Young, who
was the youngest Catholic bishop in
Australian history when he was raised
to the purple in 1948, is now only 51
and something of an innovator. He has
made strenuous efforts to inform his
people not only of the new rituals but
of the “message of the Vatican Coun-
cil.” To the astonishment of some of
his episcopal colleagues he made history
last year when he had laymen ascend
into the pulpits of Tasmanian churches
to speak to their fellow parishioners
about the Council and its consequences
for the religious life of the laity.
The Hobart senate of clergy has
taken responsibility for the setting up
of a Diocesan Pastoral Council, for the
religious education of Catholic children
in Government schools, the setting out
of a salary system for Tasmanian
priests, and a sermon list for priests
of the archdiocese. The Church in Tas-
mania is regarded as the most demo-
cratically organised in Australia. It
seems significant that last year when
rumors were out that Archbishop Young
might be transferred to Melbourne or
Canberra-Goulburn the priests of Tas-
mania sent a petition to Pope Paul re-
questing that Young be left where he is
“for many years to come.”
Young is not a “political” bishop in
the way Mannix was and Fox is by
statement and Gilroy is by practice. He
is, however, known to be sympathetic
to the objectives of the DLP and the
quality of his concerns may be revealed
in the fact that a few months after the
bishops collectively issued their state-
ment deploring what they alleged was
an increase in “immorality,” he wrote
a pastoral letter urging Catholics to
support the campaign to get the Gov-
ernment to allocate one percent of the
gross national product to help the
poorer nations of the world.
Bishop Rush of Rockhampton is
another member of the hierarchy who
is regarded as being sympathetic to
European developments and the con-
cerns of the educated laity. He also
studied at the extremely conservative
Propaganda College, but like Arch-
bishop Young enjoys episcopal youth at
51 years of age. The new Bishop of
Cairns, Bishop John Torpie, also shares
some of these sympathies, and during
his recent welcoming into the See
stressed that it was “essential for<a priest
and for a bishop to play his part as a
citizen in the community with a deep
interest with his fellow citizens in the
well-being and prosperity of that com-
munity.”
The Catholic bishops of Australia
have always been keen advocates of
social and economic justice. They have
also been sharp to take opportunities
of advancing the economic interests of
the Church and the Catholic com-
munity. The Sydney administration has
often been accused of “wheeler-dealing”
and has earned the open contempt, of
many prominent supporters of the DLP
for failure to maintain solidarity with
the anti-Communist forces in the Labor
Party in 1955. One of the charges is
that the Cardinal’s men sold out the
national interest for their own parochial
gains.
However, these kinds of political dif-
ferences no longer seem so intense, and
now that the State Aid fight has been
won in principle and partly in substance
it is noticeable that many of the bishops
are beginning to address themselves to
the whole community instead of just
to their Catholic congregations. To
those who grew up amidst undercur-
rents of bigotry and near-idolatry of the
Pope, the response of the bishops to the
call for ecumenism has been beyond all
expectations.
The real test of their administrative
resilience may come when they begin
to realise that growing numbers of
priests, especially those in orders, and
scripturally educated laity are not much
impressed with the claims that bishops
should have so much authority in mat-
ters of conscience, faith, or morals. The
Constitution of the Church calls the
bishops “the principle and foundation
of unity”; a lot of Catholics simply
don’t believe it.
Over the next decade the bishops will
be confronted with the emergence of a
new kind of Catholic, a literate, inde-
pendent person who does not give
assent to some or other doctrines of the
Church nor to the power of bishops to
direct him. Influenced by the latest
speculative theology and scriptural
studies he wall want to join in prayer
and worship with his bishop, but he will
not in any sense be prepared to obey
him. These may be difficult days for an
episcopacy trained in the conservative
tradition of Propaganda College. Cer-
tainly, bell, book, and candle will not
be of much use in such a crisis of
authority.

N.S.W - Australia’s forgotten state
By WALLACE CROUCH
EVEN WITH THE New South Wales
elections coming up on Saturday, the
people of Australia’s oldest State still
display that assured indifference to
membership of their State that distin-
guishes them from the rest of Aus-
tralia. While citizens of the State of
N.S.W. are happy to acknowledge them-
selves as citizens of Sydney or New-
castle or Wollongong or Murwillumbah
or Bourke, they do not have that sense
of statehood that marks the rest of
Australia. They really see their
addresses as “Sydney, Australia” or
“Bourke, Australia” or whatever it
might be, leaving to others such proud
boasts as “I am a Victorian” or “I am
a Queenslander”; and in their attitudes
to Australia they have no parallel to
the suspicion with which, for example,
Tasmanians speak of “the Mainland” or
Western Australians speak of “the
East,” nor do they see their State as
the Boom State or the Awakening
State, or whatever. N.S.W. is simply
the place where they live.
The place where most of them live
is the Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong
complex and in itself this 120-mile long
area contains about three-quarters of a
million more people than Western Aus-
tralia, South Australia, and Tasmania
combined. In. the past ten years
Sydney’s population has increased by
half a million—equal to the size of
Perth, and the State Planning Authority
works on the assumption that by the
year 2000 AD Sydney alone will have a
population of five million, which is
almost twice the present population of
New Zealand.
The Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong
complex continues to provide the basis
of the nation’s heavy industry. It pro-
duces 99 percent of Australia’s ingot
steel, and 88 percent of its pig iron,
employing in iron, steel, and metal pro-
ducts something like 200,000 workers.
At Wollongong-Port Kembla (pop.
178,000) Australian Iron and Steel Pty.
Ltd. (a BHP subsidiary) plans to invest
a further $lBO million—s4o million of
it in a new plate mill—in the
$3BO million iron-steel plant it already
has there.
In the other industrial city of New-
castle (pop. 327,000) the largest single
present item of development is a scheme
which will bring five islands together
into one area of ten square miles of
prime industrial land with rail, road,
and deepwater access. Already 600
acres have been opened up, and con-
struction begun on a number of indus-
trial plants, including a $35 million
nitrogen fertiliser works. Among other
large-scale industrial projects an-
nounced, or already commenced, in
N.S.W. in the past 18 months are:
• A $35 million aluminium smelter
for Alcan Australia Pty. Ltd. at Kurri
Kurri, near Newcastle.
• A $2O million synthetic rubber and
carbon black plant for Phillips Imperial
Chemicals Ltd. at Kurnell, Sydney.
• A $2O million paper-board mill at
Matraville, Sydney, for Australian
Paper Manufacturers Ltd.
• A $2O million refinery expansion at
Matraville, for Boral Ltd.
• A $l5 million refinery expansion
program for Shell at Clyde, Sydney.
• A $lO million phosphatic and mixed
fertiliser plant at Newcastle for Green-
leaf Fertilisers.
• A $l4 million expansion program at
Zetland, Sydney, for British Motor
Corporation.
® A $25 million wood-pulp mill at
Twofold Bay for Harris-Daishowa, a
joint Australian-Japanese venture.
N.S.W. houses 41 percent of Aus-
tralia’s secondary industry and it makes
44 percent of the nation’s manufactured
goods. Investment in factory building,
land, plant, and machinery in N.S.W.
now totals more than $3331 million,
39.5 percent higher than Victoria, the
next most industrialised State. The
annual output of the State’s 24,531
factories is valued in excess of
$6OOO million, 42 percent of the value
of total Australian factory output.
Diversification of industry now
enables N.S.W. to export electric start-
ing apparatus and printing machinery
to Germany, fire sprinkler and lawn-
mowers to Britain, transformers and
rectifiers, roller bearings and piston
rings to the U.S., and aircraft parts,
centrifugal pumps, and clothes pegs to
Canada. Recently a Sydney engineering
firm won a $U.5.2.5 million contract
for eight of the largest climbing-tower
cranes in the world. These cranes,
designed and built in Sydney, will be
shipped to New York to build a 1500 ft.
World Trade Centre there.
As an electrified State, N.S.W. has
an installed power generated capacity
of 3750 megawatts. More than 95 per-
cent of even its outback properties now
get electric power. Over the next seven
years, to cope with increased industrial
demand, this supply will be doubled,
with two new stations being built on
the coalfields, the 1400 megawatt Mun-
morah station (to be completed in
1970), and the 2000 megawatt Liddell
station (costing $2OO million, due for
completion in 1974), plus further gener-
ating plant on the Snowy Mountains.
Sydney Harbor is still Australia’s
No. 1 port and at last, with a $95 mil-
lion program, it is to be modernised.
Botany Bay will be planned as a sub-
sidiary port; the Newcastle port is being
expanded; and the Government is hav-
ing a think about opening up two new
ports. The State’s railway network will
have gone over completely to diesel
operations by 1970; the Parkes-Broken
Hill rail-line is being up-graded to
accommodate the heavy traffic expected
when the Sydney-Perth standard-gauge
railway comes into service early next
year; and it looks as if Sydney’s $B5
million Eastern Suburbs Raihvay may
at last be built.
Even with the great iron-ore, nickel,
bauxite, and oil discoveries elsewhere
in Australia, N.S.W., still accounts for
40 percent of Australia’s mineral
wealth. Black coal is still Australia’s
most valuable extracted mineral, and,
in 1967, 77 percent of it was mined in
N.S.W. from workable deposits esti-
mated to contain at least 14,000
million tons. While stiffer competition
from natural gas and fuel oil will, over
the next few years, restrict the domestic
market for some types of coal, both
higher electricity generation within the
State and greatly increased demand by
Japanese steel mills should keep the
N.S.W. coal industry healthy. (Of
seven million tons of coal N.S.W. ex-
ported in 1966-67, 6.6 million tons
went to Japan—with bigger orders
placed recently.)
The handsome returns on lead, zinc,
and silver from the Broken Hill mines
have helped considerably to finance
mineral discoveries elsewhere in Aus-
tralia: the copper mine at Cobar is
one of the country’s most prolific pro-
ducers; and two tin mines, at Ardlethan
and at Tallanljung, are being developed
as high-level producers. Over the past
five years beach sands between Sydney
and Brisbane have yielded enough
zircon and rutile to supply nearly 91
percent of world demand. Almost
three-quarters of the State’s land sur-
face and much of its offshore wateis
are being prospected for phosphates, oi >
natural gas, lead, zinc, copper, tin,
and other minerals.
Wool continues to be Australia s piin-
cipal single source of export income,
and N.S.W. remains Australia s
principal wool producer. With 40 pei
cent of Australia’s sheep population in
N.S.W. (at more than 156 million,
making up the world’s largest sheep
flock), N.S.W. usually contributes some-
where between 35 and 40 percent °
the nation’s wool cheque. Altoget e
N.S.W. contributes 37 percent or
nation’s primary production, wit i
yearly income running at more than
$llOO million.
The ups and downs of drought bring
huge changes to wheat production in
N.S.W. In 1965-66, the year of the
big drought, the State’s yield slumped
as low as 39 million bushels; a year
later it was up to a record yield of
202 million bushels;. this year, because
of bad weather, it may be down to
95 million bushels. But normally
N.S.W. accounts for a bit less than 40
percent of Australia’s wheat crop.
N.S.W. is by far the most important
cotton producer in the nation, largely
due to the efforts of American expat-
riate farmers in the Wee Waa district
of the north-west. Eight years ago
there were fewer than 100 acres of the
State under cotton; now the acreage is
higher than 35,000; next to wheat,
cotton now represents the highest crop
value in the State. By 1965 N.S.W.
was producing 75 percent of Australia’s
cotton crop. Australia, in turn, was
producing 75 percent of its raw cotton
requirements, and 16 percent, in all
fields, of the nation’s cotton usage. It
is this assured and accessible supply
which has led Bonds Industries Ltd. to
establish a new $2 million spinning and
weaving plant at Lithgow, N.S.W.
N.S.W. also produces one-fifth of
Australia’s butter, nearly one-third of'
the bacon and ham, one-quarter of the
oats, more than one-third of the maize,
and nearly all the rice. With almost
one-third of the fishing boats in the
nation, N.S.W. catches three-eighths of
the fish. It is also the most important
timber-producing State.
If cotton has provided a bright new
spot in the N.S.W. rural scene, the
dairy industry—or sections of it—makes
for a gloomy one. For many farmers
outside the Sydney Milk Zone, especi-
ally those on the North Coast, milk
producing has become an economic
liability, and more drastic Common-
wealth-State action, probably to the
extent of forcing inefficient dairymen
Mto alternative pursuits, is likely if
the threat of a massive burden of sub-
sidies is to be lifted.
Further general expansion of N.S.W.
agriculture hinges on making the State
free of the worst effects of drought,
to this end water conservation is
hhS.W.’s biggest single challenge. The
Government has embarked on a
long-range program of dam building,
hut this will take at least $l2OO million
and 25 years to achieve. For inspira-
tion, water conservationists draw on the
success of the Murrumbidgee Irriga-
tion Scheme .(which now provides
Sydney with a quarter of its food
supplies) and the embryo Coleambally
on,
three major dams, Wyangala, Blowering,
and Pindara. Last year State Parlia-
ment approved construction of four new
dams —the $45 million Copeton on the
Gwydir, the $7.5 million Lostock on
the Paterson, the $5.3 million Toonum-
bar on the Richmond, and the $4.2 mil-
lion Carcoar on the Belubula. Com-
pletion of these dams, as the first stage
in the big scheme, should add $5.3 mil-
lion a year to the State’s rural income.
But there is a long way to go before all
of N.S.W. will be able to boast of being
relatively droughtproof.
In his policy speech on February 9
the Premier, Mr. Askin, told of N.S.W.
regaining the lead, among the States,
as regards intake of immigrants, as well
as in the rate of new factory growth
and production. But N.S.W. has some
catching up te*. do in population growth.
With 4,325,352 people (including 3700
full-blooded Aborigines) accounted for
by the Commonwealth Statistician in
N7S.W. as of last September, N.S.W. is
Nevi South Wales, as the rest of
Australia sees it
still more than a million people ahead
of the next most-populated State,
Victoria. But N.S.W.’s population
growth-rate in 1966-67 was only 1.63
percent on the previous year; only
South Australia and Tasmania had
lower figures (Victoria was 1.68 per-
cent). Those regions with really im-
pressive growth rates were the A.C.T.,
7.87 percent; Northern Territory, 6.43
percent; and Western Australia, 3.37
percent. The uneven distribution of
N.S.W.’s population causes the N.S.W.
Government to be more obsessed with
decentralisation —and to spend more
money on this — any other State.
Only about three-quarters of a million
N.S.W. people live in country towns,
and little more than half a million on
farms and properties. While Sydney
has gained half a million people in the
past ten years, in the same period
country population outside the Sydney,
Illawarra, Newcastle regions has risen
by only 30,000.
The drift to the cities is a trend
common to all States, in fact to all
industrialised countries, but Govern-
ment planners in N.S.W. see great
dangers in this —not only in terms of
cities like Sydney becoming over-
crowded, but country areas being de-
nuded of existing workforces. Young
people make up the bulk of those
quitting the country to seek city jobs.
But a big breakthrough in luring,
industry into the country, and persuad-
ing people to stay there or settle there,
has yet to be achieved, despite a
vigorous program introduced by the
Government’s Department of Decen-
tralisation and Development, headed by
a full-time Minister, Mr. J. B. M.
Fuller. In the past years the Gov-
ernment has allocated $8 million from
its Country Industries Assistance Fund
by way of a broad range of concessions,
from loans for factory buildings and
plant, to cheaper rail freight, to help
188 industries expand or get themselves-
established in the country. Yet 70 per-
cent of the State’s manufacturing
remains in the Sydney area, 25 percent
in the Newcastle and Wollongong-Port
Kembla areas, and five percent in the
country.
In the scramble among the States,
especially the new boom ones, for
supremacy in the Australian sun,
N.S.W. still has a lot going for it to
hold on to its title as Premier State;
even though the word “Premier” smacks
a little of immediate post-Federation
smugness. Certainly a mineral dis-
covery of some magnitude would help
N.S.W. consolidate its grip on No. 1
place; this is especially true of a big
natural gas find if N.S.W. is to avoid
being placed in bondage to Victoria in
using this as a major energy fuel.
Still, it could be that in the future
Melbourne does outgrow Sydney and
the State of Victoria steals from N.S.W.
some of its “firsts.” Even so, will any
citizen of N.S.W., considering his
apparent indifference to his own State’s
form in the All-Australian Development
Race, think or care much about this:’
Or even know it?


The States
Where should
the money
come from?
By PETER SAMUEL
THIS WEEK IN N.S.W., next month
in South and Western Australia, State
governments are facing the people. The
big issues on which they will fight their
election campaigns are mostly about
money —how they will spend it. But a
more basic issue is in dispute, an issue
which has not yet become a popular
electoral one but which is a major
political and economic problem. It is
the issue of where the money the State
governments want to spend is to come
from.
To the average voter, it is those ser-
vices which are the responsibility of the
State governments, rather than the
Commonwealth, where the money seems
to be shortest. Metropolitan voters are
obviously dissatisfied with overcrowded
primary and secondary schools, lack of
sewerage, traffic congestion, and
antiquated hospitals, while rural voters
think of the charges they pay for water,
the chances of getting electricity, and
freight rates. Except for pensioners, the
Commonwealth area of government is
more distant and indirect, the inade-
quacies far less apparent.
Late last year, when Victorian
Premier Bolte announced his cent-in-
ten-dollars receipts tax, a number of
Canberra officials cheered. They hoped
it would bring a showdown between the
Commonwealth and the States, forcing
them to devise some guidelines for the
future of Commonwealth-States finan-
cial relations, so that the annual
wrangle at the Premiers’ Conference-
Loan Council meeting could be made
a little more orderly and rational. For
over the past two or three years the
States have presented increasingly
powerful cases to the Commonwealth
for a new financial deal. They do have
a basis in statistics for complaining
about the level of Commonwealth
assistance. As the top table shows, the
States have, over the past decade, in-
creased their own taxes and charges at
a considerably faster rate than the
Commonwealth has increased its contri-
bution to their budgets. They have had
to do this to pay for what they regard
as vital public works and services. As a
result,' the States have had to carry the
political. odium for increasing their
imposts on the voting public by a
greater proportion than the expansion
of the services they offer in return. And
they are even finding it difficult to do
this; recently the Commonwealth has
moved to frustrate the States when they
wanted to enlarge their area of self-help
by levying new taxes themselves.
Improvisation has always been the
means of adjusting to these problems
in the past, and institutions or innova-
tions once made have almost never
been unmade. The year 1927 saw the
States hand over loan-raising to the
Commonwealth, because they were con-
cerned at the costly consequences of
competitive loan-floating on the Lon-
don market; 1942 saw the States lose
their main field of taxation, on incomes
to the Commonwealth to provide the
financial base for its war effort. These
changes were the major factors deter-
mining the pattern of Commonwealth-
States financial relations as we have
them today. Both arose out of short-
lived emergencies. Within three years
their causes had disappeared. The 1930
Depression shattered the London loan
market for Australian governments, yet
the Loan Council lived on; Hiroshima
shattered the Japanese, but the Com-
monwealth income-tax monopoly re-
mained, also to become $ permanent
institutional fixture.
Increasing frustration on the part of
the States was met in 1965 by a revision
of the “formula,” under which general
revenue grants are dispensed. It has also
been met increasingly by making addi-
tional grants to friendly governments
having elections, by favoring projects
in States with voters of dubious
reliability, and by an expansion of Com-
monwealth activity into the vogue areas
—universities, water conservation,
science laboratories, and the like. A
great upsurge of extra grants came in
1966, under States’ pressure, and early
1967 produced an uncharacteristic
promise by the Commonwealth of a
“major review” of the general question
of Commonwealth-States financial rela-
tions. The State Premiers were no
longer satisfied with improvisation. But
Mr. Holt, having promised a major
review, could not face up to the creative
thought it would require or the poten-
tial difficulty it might create. So it got
forgotten by the Commonwealth. Last
June’s meeting went on exactly as
before.
And if his short record to date is
any indication of things to come, Mr.
Gorton may yet be titled the Grandest
Improviser-of-’em-all. Faced with
critical decisions on how to handle
Premier Bolte’s receipts tax, he has
shown remarkable agility in avoiding
any decision. To quote from his recent
Press conference: “We regard it in
principle as a tax on income and
therefore a breach of the Uniform Tax
Agreement. But we don’t want a con-
frontation. There’s a whole lot of things
connected with it that require discus-
sion and ultimate resolution, and there’s
no violent hurry about the thing.”
Pressed for an elaboration: “I don’t
regard this cent-in-ten-dollars (of
Bolte) as in itself a threat to uniform
taxation. After all, W.A. has been
imposing something of the kind for
some time, but if the principle were
to be accepted and ultimately expanded
so that it became 10c or 50c or some-
thing like that, then that would Teach
the stage where it would be a threat
. . .” So the showdown for which frus-
trated officials hoped has been averted,
for the time being, at least. And only
hours later Mr. Gorton was with his
election-pressed Liberal colleague,
Premier Askin, doing some improvisa-
tion on his behalf a promise of extra
drought money and some arrangement
to get N.S.W. higher loan authorisa-
tions. This will be paid for with the
wrath of five other States.
The Commonwealth must sometime
make some sort of decision on Mr.
Bolte’s receipts tax. Mr. Gorton appears
to be basing his indecision on the pro-
position that, at a cent in ten dollars,
Bolte’s tax is unobjectionable. In Aus-
tralian politics, if you’re against some-
thing only in principle, then you are
really not against it. You are just
warning that you might get agin it
sometime, if . . . Mr. Gorton implies
that, if the tax is raised beyond a cer-
tain rate of cents in the dollar, his
objections will cease to be merely
principled and become real. Sir Henry
Bolte and his Premier colleagues are
going to want to know at what rate
this transformation is going to occur.
The first major issue Commonwealth
ministers will have to resolve is
whether they can accept the idea of


rapidly rising State taxes that are pay-
ing for an increasing proportion of their
activities. A number of people in the
Commonwealth Government are appre-
hensive about it, and have therefore
been reluctant to allow the States to
move into new tax fields. Their fears are
based on a belief that without absolute
financial predominance the Common-
wealth would not be able to exercise
its role as national economic stabiliser,
damping the economy in times of excess
pressure and boosting it when slack.
The Commonwealth Government is
certainly right to ensure that it main-
tains and improves its powers to steer
the economy between the wastes of in-
flation and unemployment. This form
of economic management is one of its
major responsibilities. But it seems that
some Commonwealth ministers have
completely exaggerated the extent to
which the States can cause them diffi-
culties in economic management. The
Commonwealth’s ability to influence the
level of economic activity depends
mainly on its control over the total level
of loan raising and its ability to vary
the size of its Budget deficit or surplus
to suit economic conditions. Its effective
control over the Loan Council, where
the States get their borrowing entitle-
ment each year, means that it can con-
trol the extent to which the State
governments and their instrumentalities
spend beyond their ability to raise
money by taxation and charges. It can
that way determine the size of their
impact on the economy and allow for
this in the framing of its budgetary and
monetary policy, just the way it
attempts to allow for the impact of
capital spending by private firms.
Unlike the Federal Government, the
State governments have no Reserve
Banks of their own to allow them to
run big cash deficits by printing money
or issuing Treasury notes. True, they
manage by fiddling with trust funds
and cash balances to get some flexibility
from year to year, but only a little. They
are never likely to get enough flexi-
bility to act as an independently “de-
stabilising” factor on the Australian
economy as a whole. The Common-
wealth has frequently in the past decade
altered the extent of its Budget deficit
by s3oom. or s4oom. in order to boost
or damp the national economy, but the
States, through fiddling cash and trust
accounts, have hardly been able to find
more than s2om. or s3om. flexibility
beyond that granted them by the Com-
monwealth at the Loan Council meeting.
This is about the maximum extent
to which the States have been able to
act independently of the Common-
wealth. The expansion of their tax
base would not increase this independ-
ence, since the States, unlike the Com-
monwealth, will always want to spend
the money they raise.
There is therefore no danger to the
Commonwealth in allowing States to
develop new taxes like those proposed
loudly by Sir Henry Bolte and imple-
mented quietly by the Western Aus-
tralians. But there are several reasons
why personal income taxation may be
considered one of the less desirable
areas for the 'States to enter. One is the
instability of the revenues they bring
in, reacting more than proportionately
to swings in economic activity. A second
is the already high level of personal
income tax, and a third the extra
damned nuisance for individuals of fill-
ing in a second complex form and the
high administrative cost of processing.
Whatever the Commonwealth de-
cides at its eventual showdown con-
ference with State Premiers, it must
give them some guidelines about where
it would like them to go for the extra
money they obviously are going to need.
The taxation of business seems an
appropriate area, especially since the
administration of company law is an
important part of their legal responsi-
bilities. If the Commonwealth wants
the States to keep out of personal in-
come taxation, then it should indicate
where it thinks the States could go.
And since it has responsibility for the
general efficiency of the economy,
under its accepted mandate to ensure
a high rate of economic growth, it
should give some guidance on which
taxes are least undesirable from a
national viewpoint. This might encour-
age a maximum uniformity of taxation
between the States, while still allowing
them flexibility to deal with their special
needs.
All this leads to the broader ques-
tion of general division of powers and
responsibilities between Commonwealth
and State governments. Some Labor
reformers see the only solution to the
problems of Commonwealth-States
financial relations in the abolition of
State governments and the implementa-
tion of the unitary system of govern-
ment which the ALP platform demands.
Similarly, a few State Liberals see the
need to return to sovereign State
governments, diminishing greatly the
role of the Commonwealth. It might be
arguable that either of these alternatives
provides the only “final solution” to
the problem. But they are both out-
side the realm of attainable possibilities
for the foreseeable future. Not only does
the Constitution erect unscalable
obstacles, but the political power of
vested interests is an immense defence
against radical change in either dir-
ection. The strength of tradition is
demonstrated beautifully in the fact
that the party of Unitarian principle,
the ALP, is unable to alter its State-
based organisational structure and in
government in N.S.W. found it impos-
sible to abolish the Upper House. Too
many people in too many places have
become far too dependent on State and
Federal governments to make it real-
istic for even a radically minded gov-
ernment to attempt any drastic upset
in the balance. Mr. Whitlam has re-
sponded by proposing what seems an
indiscriminate expansion of the Com-
monwealth role, through the extension
of tied, and conditional, grants to the
States and a steady encroachment on
areas at present a State responsibility.
This is more realistic and attainable.
Indeed, it would probably amount to
merely an acceleration of what has been
happening during the past two decades
of Liberal rule. And that has been un-
necessarily untidy and unsystematic.
The most pressing problem which
this approach ignores is the need to
achieve a better balance between what
the States must spend and their revenue
resources. It is unreal to expect to be
able to devise any precise matching
of the two and thereby eliminate Com-
monwealth payments to the States
(which, in any case, will always be
needed in order to equalise standards
of government services between the
States). But that does not mean there
is any need for the immense gap which
exists between State spending and
State revenue raising to rerhain in-
definitely.
At present the States as a whole are
only about one-third self-sufficient in
financing. The proportion ranges from
nearly 50 percent in the case of N.SW.
and Victoria to less than ten percent
in Tasmania. The “spending resources
gap” at $2400m. is so large at present
that it has a thoroughly damaging
effect on both planning and the politi-
cal process. Planning is hampered

through the Commonwealth’s inade-
quate knowledge, as financier, of de-
tailed needs in the States, and through
State uncertainty about finance for the
future. The political process is damaged
by the buckpassing which the gap inr
evitably generates. Quite correctly, both
sets of politicians complain about their
plight and proclaim their innocence:
the States that they do not have the
financial resources, and the Common-
wealth that the deficiency is in an
area of State responsibility.
The first way to reduce the gap is
for the Commonwealth to take full
financial responsibility for those areas
of spending where it already has full
administrative and planning control.
Universities are the classic example.
They are now entirely in the hands
of the Commonwealth Government
through the Australian Universities
Commission and yet the State govern-
ments, without any say in their run-
ning, are expected to contribute more
than half their costs. A complete take-
over of universities by the Common-
wealth would bring no expansion of
its administrative role, which is com-
plete already, but a matching of its
financial responsibility to the role it
has acquired. The same goes for the
rest of tertiary education, which in-
cludes the area of technology insti-
tutes which need rapid expansion, and
also adult trade training once the
Government breaks down the reac-
tionary resistance of trade unions to this
important innovation. Primary and
secondary education could then be left
entirely to the States.
With the Commonwealth providing
money for trunk railway standardisa-
tion and modernisation and develop-
mental roads in the North and Tas-
mania, it seems logical to see it take
over responsibility for inter-capital
highways. With containerisation bring-
ing a revolution to shipping transport,
it might make sense for the Common-
wealth to consider moving into this
field in the way it co-ordinates the
building of airports.
The general principle being enunci-
ated is that, rather than interfering
in a bitsy, dispersed way with condi-
tional grants for this project or that,
the Commonwealth would do better
to take over full responsibility for
some areas and leave others com-
pletely alone for the States. This need
not always mean an expansion of the
Commonwealth role, in the way so
far described. Sometimes it would lead
to an enlargement of States’ roles.
Such a de-blurring of Common-
wealth and State responsibilities
might reduce the financial burden of
the States by some s2oom. or $300m.,
but it would still leave a huge res-
ponsibility-revenue gap of about
s2ooom. The neatest way of closing
this would be the transfer of com-
pany taxation to the States. This
raises some sBsom. at present rates,

about 15 percent of the Common-
wealth’s total revenues and would fit
in with the principle that company
administration should be a State
responsibility. This is a peculiarly
bad tax for the authorities to change
from time to time in pursuit of
economic stability, so the Common-
wealth would lose nothing of value to
its management of the economy by giv-
ing it to the States. It also happens
that sBsom. comes neatly close to fill-
ing the responsibilitity-revenue gap,
leaving only s3oom. or s4oom. to be
disbursed by the Commonwealth to the
States. It would be very hard to
x educe this further, for such a sum
will always have to be disbursed if
there are to be equalisation payments.
The Australian Federation does seem
to be based very much on the belief
that Australians in whatever State
they live are entitled to a similar level
of Government services without suffer-
ing a higher burden of taxation or
charges. Since the less-populated
States generally have larger areas to
service with transport and power, and
have a smaller number of taxpayers
to carry the inevitable overhead costs
of government administration, they
must have larger per capita Common-
wealth grants if equalisation is to be
achieved. And this is heavily built
into the system of existing grants.
The distribution of grants is the
classic product of history’s mishmash
of improvisations and compromises. It
is based partly on income-tax levels
and loan raisings by the States in the
ancient times when they did these
things independently; partly in formulae
related to wage levels, popula-
tion growth, immigration, and the like.
Also it is a product of the differing
bargaining strengths of various Premiers
and the competence of State treasuries
in compiling a case : for handouts.
Western Australia’s grants look very
high. Once a depressed area, it is now
Australia’s boom State, industrialisation
and minerals development having
achieved great momentum. Per capita
incomes, once ten percent below most
other States except Tasmania, are now
well up to those of all but N.S.W.
and Victoria. A good slice of its money
should probably go to Queensland,
which, given its development potential
and present depressed status, should be
getting far more than now. N.S.W. also
seems to contribute more than its share
of the redistribution money for the
supplicant States. Its per capita income
has always been somewhat below Vic-
toria’s and so, if anything, it deserves
slightly more Commonwealth money
per capita, not slightly less. But this
area of redistribution of money
horizontally between the States is prob-
ably the one least susceptible to treat-
ment by formula and therefore best
left to improvisation and compromise.
It is the vertical problems of trying to
match responsibilities with revenue
resources which needs some bold plan-
ning.




MALAYSIA-SINGAPORE
The British stop buying time
This is the second of three articles, the first of which
appeared in the February 70 issue of The Bulletin
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
IN SINGAPORE
DID THE BRITISH really fit into
Singapore and Malaysia, anyway? Was
their “presence,” for example, in accord
with the ASEAN association of Thai-
land, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
and the Philippines? Theoretically not.
The original ASEAN declaration in
Bangkok last August made reference to
the temporary nonsubversive and there-
fore acceptable function of foreign
military bases in relation to national
independence. Since four of the ASEAN
signatories had bases on their soil
with those in the Philippines on a more
permanent basis than those in Malaysia-
Singapore and (maybe) Thailand
this was widely interpreted as a con-
cession to Indonesia.
Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Adam
Malik needs the reference for domestic
consumption while all ASEAN coun-
tries needed it for international con-
sumption, to show that ASEAN was
no Western creation. The contrast on
the Indonesian side was with the old
days of dogmatic neutralism of the
kind you still hear in New Delhi. Then
all bases were wrong, no matter what.
It can be argued, of course, that
Indonesia after confrontation was in
no position to take a dogmatic stand,
since her neighbors still had good
reason not to trust her: but equally it
has to be recognised why Indonesia
will never be wholly in favor of foreign
military presences. What nation in the
world favors restrictions on its own
freedom of action and manoeuvre? And
in the ASEAN scheme of things, if
there were no outside presences,
obviously a united Indonesia would at
least exercise more sway or at the
most further her continuing dreams of
regional hegemony.
In this context the ASEAN reference
is but a reminder of another dream
which retains its potency despite its
impracticality, that of “Asian solutions
to Asian problems.” True, in the hands
of chauvinists the slogan can become
a vehicle for self-seeking racial prej-
udice. As such it is after all a reaction
to the still continuing reality of
Caucasian racial prejudice. But “Asia
for Asians” is much more than, just a
counter-prejudice. Fundamentally it is
an emotion which takes its strength
from the very understandable desire to
rectify the imbalances of a recent
history of Western dominance.
This is not to accept the proposition
that “white troops” will have no place
at all in the Afro-Asia of the future
a concept paraded around with all the
self-righteousness of revealed truth by
Mr. Mayhew and other opponents of
East of Suez in England. What it does
mean is that these emotions are part of
the milieu in which foreign presences
have to work and justify themselves.
Ironically, having proved Mr. Mayhew
wrong in the past few years in Malaysia-
Singapore, the British are withdrawing
partly in the belief that he is right.
In passing it can be noted that, taken
to the absurd, Mr. Mayhew’s revealed
truth could well question Australia’s
right to exist. More relevantly, bear-
ing in mind that “Australasian solutions
for Australasian problems” are the
order of the day, simply because of
these emotions, Australia will have to
work the harder to convince Asians
about regional solutions to regional
problems. There’s still a long way
to go.
One point Mayhew makes must be
borne in mind. For him the unanswer-
able argument came from Ho Chi
Minh. Ho asked whether Europeans
would accept Asian military bases in
Europe. By accepting that they
wouldn’t, Mayhew suggests the racial
prejudice underlying Europe’s drift
toward isolationism. The crucial ques-
tion the North Vietnamese leader
actually raises is: are allies only to be
selected on a racial basis? Australians
have to look at this very hard. If the
answer is yes, then “fortress Australia”
must be the philosophy. If no, then
why not underline the point by asking
a Malaysian battalion to come to Aus-
tralia for exercises, maybe at the
Queensland jungle training school
and soon, while the RAF is still avail-
able to transport them there and back?
If the British presence could be a
provocation it could also be a
soporific. A presence may have a dif-
ferent effect to that which is intended.
It may promote short-term answers to
long-range problems. Aimed at pro-
moting “security”, it may not prevent
and may actually promote perhaps un-
foreseen “insecurities,” especially in an
area that abounds with them.
The excellent job now being done by
the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry
keeping the peace in Mauritius brilli-
antly illustrates that point. Briefly, ugly
communal riots showed signs of spread-
ing island-wide. It would not be exag-
gerating to suggest that the psychologi-
cal impact of the arrival of les soldats
Brittaniques was alone enough to stop
them spreading; certainly the impact
was out of all proportion to the work
done by the troops, together with the
colonial police. So much so that one
danger is that the police will have lost
more respect than they deserve to lose
a crucial loss with independence just
around the corner.
An opposition leader, while admit-
ting that the Malacca-based troops
were necessary and desirable, still
couldn’t help wondering if the local
police should not have been left to
struggle to control the situation by
themselves, even at the cost of
extra lives lost, to demonstrate that
they were not in need of a crutch.
“Since the people feel the soldiers
have done the job,” he said to me,
“there may be more lawlessness when
they leave.” More important still, as
independence approaches, Mauritian
politics are cleft along communal lines.
One significant community looks like
being left in Opposition, with the
majority community and one minority
controlling power. The riots were be-
tween the two minorities. Before the
riots the Government was cautiously
feeling its way toward compromise if
not coalition with the opposition
minority. In a nutshell, the security
better, complacency bred by the
“presence” meant that these moves
were forgotten, whereas perhaps more
insecurity would have made them im-
perative.
So, in the same way, one can argue
that the soporific effect of the con-
tinued British presence was a cause, one
among many, of confrontation. Malay-
sia, and earlier Malaya, neither saw
nor felt the need to establish substantial
working relationships with her im-
mediate neighbors. Confrontation might
conceivably have been obviated by
mushawarah even as it was ended by it.
Similarly it can be argued that even
as the worst effects of the separation
of Singapore and Malaysia cannot now
be ended by Anglo-Anzac pressure, so
also the Singapore-base economy, while
it is retained, makes it even less likely
that the Singapore leaders will explore
all their options, notably /emerger.
Similarly a presence which successfully
inhibits or prevents the growth of in-
surgency may also inhibit or even pre-
vent the local leaders developing the
national counter-dynamism which, in
the long run, is the only antidote to
communists or any other rebels. As
of now this would seem particularly true
of the sustained American presence in
the Philippines.
These two major reservations apart
that there is one wave in the Asian
tide not necessarily favorable t°
foreign presences and that such
presences may conceivably inhibit the
ends they ostensibly seek the simple
fact remains that the British presence
until now has fitted and would have
continued to fit into the regional and
also the international jigsaw puzzle.
Regionally it is a balancing factor
and new balances of power are not
yet in sight. Internationally only a
myopic or a communist vision would
want an additional cause for instability
in an area unstable enough already. For
this is what the accelerated withdrawal
would seem to be.
Put another way, one can indicate
both how the British presence fits and
what the likely impact will be of its
quicker removal by returning to the all-
important factor of time. Suppose the
•original mid-’seventies timetable had
been retained. What difference would
it have made? Essentially time timer
for Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew to mellow and become less
abrasive toward and more cognisant of
his neighbors’ sensitivities; time for
Singapore’s economy to absorb the mas-
sive shock of withdrawal instead of
producing an unemployment which in
turn could have political and inter-
national repercussions; time for Malay-
sia to find out the answer to the
question of what happens when Tunku
Abdul Rahman is no longer Prime
Minister; time for Kuala Lumpur to
take a more detached and realistic
view of Singapore and her other
neighbors prior to working out more
substantial relationships with them;
time for the various regional elites,
mostly Western-educated or Western-
oriented, to show whether they can
mobilise the masses over whom they
rule toward modernisation; time for
everyone to see how the winds of law-
lessness, disorder, instability, and change
will blow through the Indonesian and
Philippines archipelagos; time for the
United States to grapple and come to
terms with the problem of its basic
over-commitment in Vietnam, Thai-
land, and the Philippines (and maybe
even Japan, too); time for the Jap-
anese to steadily rather than abruptly
end their isolation from the world and
for the rest of the world to become less
isolated from Japan (if not from Jap-
anese goods); time for China to feel
less threatened and to become less
threatening; time for realistic relation-
ships to be worked out on both sides as
between South-East Asia and the
U-S.S.R.; time so that the United States,
having now lost its one remaining
m ajor ally, does not withdraw into
Australia s Paul Hasluck (left) being greeted by Indonesia’s Adam Malik during a

isolation, giving up in despair in the
face of complexities and subtleties dimly
perceived and in any case outside the
confines of a negatively anti-communist
philosophy; time, not least of all, for
Australia and New Zealand to make up
for too much of their own lost time, to
make their own way in the area in
which they find themselves devising
policies and strategies distinctively
ANZAC, divorced from trailing on
others’ coat tails.
Britain has made it clear that she is
no longer buying time for anybody
outside Europe. Two years ago British
Defence Minister Denis Healey, in off-
the-record sessions in Singapore, made
it clear that the future of the British
presence awaited the outcome of the
Vietnamese imbroglio. Britain has lost
patience. Time was hers to give and
she is not giving it. This is not to
argue that everything will go wrong as
a result, rather that things might well
have gone right. Maybe out of what now
seems decidedly an act of negative
statesmanship (of the highest order)
positive results will emerge. Maybe. It
looks as if Mr. Wilson’s one major
radical move, that of ending East of
Suez, has been taken for insular and
conservative reasons—and yet it may
have very radical effects. What are
they?
For a start, a major potential cause
for instability would seem to be that,
from geo-politicians claiming to under-
stand Asia, right down to grass roots
politicians who don’t really give a damn
about distant peoples, far too many
people have been talking of a vacuum.
“Vacuum” suggests a complete empti-
ness. Accelerated withdrawal or no
accelerated withdrawal, this is not so.
The defence budgets of all South-East
Asian countries are already inflated,
often grossly.
There is no South-East Asian country
completely incapable of defending itself.
The concept of a vacuum presents the
wrong image, conveying as it does the
idea of an emptiness which has to be
filled. It is much better to talk in
terms of imbalance.
Imbalance is created because the
British departure means the disappear-
ance of some of the more sophisticated
hardware of modern warfare from the
region. Perhaps more important, it also
means the disappearance of certain pro-
fessional skills and talents that the
events of the past 20 years, particularly,
(notably the Malayan emergency) have
caused the British to develop. In
future the troops available in Europe
for the role Britain is no longer willing
to play will not have been trained in
jungle warfare. Not so long ago the
King’s Shropshire Light Infantry
Battalion —a company of which is now
in Mauritius—played the role of
“enemy” in Australia in an exercise
designed to improve a newly formed
Australian battalion. In future this
kind of valuable military assistance will
no longer be available.
One more irony in a situation that
abounds with them lies in the fact that
today at what the British are incorrectly
seeing as “the end of Empire,” the
British forces are far better prepared
for jungle warfare than they were at
the Empire’s height—and particularly
than they were in 1941.
It is not at all encouraging, therefore,
to read of Washington officials reacting
to the accelerated withdrawal with
statements such as “the gap will have to
be filled with the overlay of power."
Was it, one may ask, the “overlay of
power” that resulted in no South
Korean-based fighters going to the
rescue of the good ship Pueblo simply
because they were only rigged for
nuclear action? Similarly it is note-
worthy that some perceptive observers
of the South Vietnamese scene claim
that successive overlays of American
power have tended to result in almost
proportionate decreases in South Viet-
namese initiative and effort. All I would
suggest is that vacuum talk tends to-
result in simple answers for complex
problems.
Imbalance conveys better the true
essence of the situation. The British
departure upsets a delicate series
of relationships. Maybe, as already sug-
gested, it will result in the jigsaw be-

coming unscrambled. But thought of
merely “filling vacuums” would seem
likely to be as unproductive as all the
king’s men and horses efforts on behalf
of Humpty Dumpty.
Not that the British have not in-
dulged in wasted overlays of power.
During the height of confrontation jet
fighters were on constant patrol over
Singapore, Bloodhound ground-to-air
missiles notwithstanding, simply because
what was imagined to be a sneak
attack could have been in the prevail-
ing circumstances an airliner with its
radio out of action . . . similarly, com-
munist guerillas in the Malayan jungle
occasionally lost a night’s sleep as
Lancaster bombers dropped their loads
on to the foliage.
Quite apart from the vacuum talk
frequently emanating from Washington,
in passing it would seem that the impact
of the British announcement on Wash-
ington could indicate another potential
instability. American policies in Asia
have been partly sold as an Anglo-
American enterprise—now this pitch is
no longer valid. In other words more
ammunition has been given to the
“isolationist” cause in the States at a
time when it has plenty to go on
already. Several authentic sources have
suggested the same incredible reality:
despite their superpower status, their
war games and computers, the Ameri-
cans did not anticipate that Wilson
would feel he could bleed the sacred
cow of the Welfare State only by first
offering a sacrificial lamb east of Suez.
Not only does this betray a short-
sightedness scarcely forgivable even in
smaller nations but it also suggests a
hurried shopping for alternatives which
can do no one any good—hence talk
of overlaying power.
What imbalances does the accelerated
withdrawal create vis-a-vis legal rela-
tionships? The Tunku still hopes that
the Anglo-Malaysian defence treaty
means something. While he concedes
that it is only “A scrap of paper,” he be-
lieves it involves “A sense of honor and
of obligation” which Britain will to
some extent still fulfil. The Tunku
hopes a five-power conference will
determine to what extent it can be ful-
filled. The Malaysian Prime Minister
certainly does not consider the defence
treaty will be abrogated.
One can hope he is right while still
feeling the hope is insecure. In fact the
Tunku made his viewpoint clear when
asked (February 13) for his reaction to
Mr. Wilson’s latest pronouncements.
These are scarcely encouraging. The
British Prime Minister has “no doubt
at all” about Malaysia-Singapore hav-
ing “the vigor and virility and ability
to look after themselves.” But then, of
course, for political reasons he cannot
affordWsuggesf tha*f therfe" i§*arfy doubt.
He would seem to be suggesting that
Britain may or may not assist if the
vigor and virility and ability of other
unstable factors in South-east Asia also
proves itself. He says in the smaller
print: “Britain will always be ready to
help its Commonwealth partners if
necessary And he goes on to stipulate
that “there will be no prior obligation
to do so nor would there be any ques-
tion of keeping a special capability in
the area.”
Bluntly, if there is no obligation
there would scarcely be any Anglo-
Malaysian defence treaty. Would there
be any SEATO either? This may seem
a minor point since already it is being
assumed that Britain will soon follow
France and Pakistan into honoring
SEATO as a mere formality without
relevance to the wider scheme of things.
But is this so? In point of fact, as
SEATO members waver, the treaty
legally underpins more and more the
United States commitment to Thailand.
In the current American political
climate it would seem that the last thing
President Johnson would want to do is
to ask the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to ratify a United States-
Thailand defence agreement. Nor
would the Thais necessarily prefer such
an agreement to SEATO, which at least
has the virtue of being nominally multi-
lateral. Of course, all this is for the
future—SEATO is not going to fold up
tomorrow. Nonetheless the bell tolls
for it as also one fears for much else.
Since words will no doubt be used to
obfuscate the legalities it is as well to
concentrate finally on two points.
First, had the British any substantial
intention to stay and honor their com-
mitments then it would have been quite
easy to present their service chiefs in
Singapore with a simple proposition—
“look, these bases are far too big, far
too expensive and militarily unjusti-
fiable. We can afford £25,000,000
per annum to honor our con-
tinuing obligations. What kind of
a presence could we have for that?”
While it would appear that for such a
sum a tight effective presence might
well have been obtained, the important
fact is that no such proposition was
ever made even as a contingency plan.
Secondly, this underlines the obvious.
The accelerated withdrawal is essen-
tially an abdication, a political decision
to quit. Some adjustments may be
possible. The five-power conference
could be valuable. The legal relation-
ships may be “adjusted” but in fact
they are disturbed. What may cause a
hell of a lot more disturbance will be
the political and psychological effects
of the hastened departure, the full
impact of which has yet to be felt.
Perennial name-dropper that he is, Mr.
Wilson, on the same American television
program from which the above quotes
are taken, disclosed that Mr. Kosygin
was “afraid that Americans would move
into these areas we are moving off.” If
that is the only move Mr. Kosygin
fears then he is not as well informed as
he should be. There are many forces,
nations, and persons seeking or creat-
ing the opposite effect. The trouble
with the British withdrawal is that it
gives them more elbow room for new
manoeuvre.


OVERSEAS
Vietnam War the manoeuvring
Russia gets another chance
at a role, on Hanoi’s terms
RUSSIA’S LEADERS are watching the
Vietnam war with hope, but also with
anxiety. Russian papers have hailed the
“popular rising” in Vietnam. Under
the collective title “We are with you,
Vietnamese brothers” they have re-
ported solidarity meetings throughout
the Soviet Union. But at the same time
both Tass and “Pravda” have argued
that the Americans can have peace if
they are reasonable, and that they can
get to the conference' table if they will
only agree unconditionally to stop
bombing North Vietnam. With the in-
ternational communist conference open-
ing in Budapest next week, the men in
the Kremlin see a slender chance of
justifying their official doctrine that
coexistence does not mean the per-
manent preservation of the status quo.
In other words, they perceive the
chance of a peace in Vietnam that
favors their side.
For Mr. Kruschev’s successors this
must feel like getting back to square
one. When they took over in October,
1964, they tried to consolidate their
position in the crumbling communist
movement by proving that coexistence
could be combined with occasional suc-
cesses in “national liberation.” Vietnam
looked like their golden opportunity.
The National Liberation Front seemed
to be winning in the'south. Mr. Kosygin
and Mr. Brezhnev thought that a
solution could be found by devising
terms that allowed the Americans to
make a graceful exit.
But the United States began to bomb
North Vietnam and to build up its
army in the south. The Americans’
purpose was to achieve peace on their
terms, with a South Vietnam in which
the NLF would be confined to the role
of, say, the Communists in Greece after
the 1946-49 civil war.
Whether or not Mr. Kosygin and
Mr. Brezhnev themselves would have
settled for such a solution, they had no
means of forcing Hanoi and the NLF
to accept it. So they embarked on three
years of very awkward coexistence,
their ears battered by shrill Chinese
charges of collusion with the United
States, and accusations by many other
Communists that they had sold their
revolutiQnary birthright for a mess of
revisionist pottage. Nevertheless, they
managed to preserve their relations
with Washington and even, after a
time, to try some new joint ventures.
The price they had to pay was provid-
ing more and more military aid for
North Vietnam.
They have even managed to
strengthen their position within the
communist movement by accusing the
Chinese of breaking up the “anti-
imperialist” front. Some militant Com-
munist Parties, such as North Korea’s,
have shifted from a pro-Chinese stand
to a neutral one in the Sino-Soviet con-
flict. But these gains have limited Rus-
sia’s scope for manoeuvre. Less than
ever can it afford to be disavowed by
Hanoi.
Whether Russia’s leaders have really
believed ever since 1964 that coexist-
ence with America could be combined
with success in Vietnam is debatable.
But now they do seem to believe what
they say. They have been given a
second chance by the military achieve-
ments of the North Vietnamese and the
Viet Cong. Three years of bombing
North Vietnam have not stopped com-
munist infiltration into South Vietnam,
and half a million American troops
have not been able to defeat the Viet
Cong. On January 30 the Viet Cong
spectacularly seized the initiative.
The Russians are familiar with the
importance of psychological and poli-
tical factors in revolutionary wars.
That is why they believe that the offen-
sive against the towns has already
changed the course of the war.
The idea, of a “Greek solution” is as
good as dead. The Russians seem to
believe that if a conference could be
organised now, their role, once again,
would be to arrange a reasonably
graceful exit for the Americans. In
this sense, they feel they are back in
1965.
But the Russians are no longer
laboring under the illusion that the
Americans are likely to leave. Even
if a growing number of Americans now
believe that the task of pacifying the
countryside and leaving a genuinely
representative government in charge of
South Vietnam is harder than they
believed, this does not mean that Presi-
dent Johnson has to give up. It is quite
likely that public opinion in the United
States will react to the latest shock by
asking for a bigger military effort. In
military terms the United States can
wage a hundred years’ war.
This explains the Russians’ mood of
anxious hope. They seem to think that
a conference held at this stage would
reach a settlement closer to Hanoi’s
terms than to those of Washington. The
policy of the present Russian leaders
would thus be vindicated. They would
be able openly to resume closer collab-
oration with the United States, while
simultaneously making a bid to reassert
Russian leadership in the communist
movement.
But if the glimmer of hope fades, if
the war goes on with increasing inten-
sity, then the pressure will grow stronger
for Moscow to break its links with
Washington and to step up its military
aid to Vietnam. It talks darkly,, but
unspecifically, of the weapons it might
send.
The pressure will be all the stronger
because communist parties all over the
world are now more committed on Viet-
nam than they used to be. The Rus-
sian Press has written too much about
the success of its “brothers” for the
Government to be able to let them
down. Communists in Western Europe,
frightened lest they be overtaken on
their left, have switched their slogan
from “Peace in Vietnam” to “Victory
Secretary General of the United Nations, U Thant, gets a cheerful welcome from
Russian officials last week before talks which centred on Vietnam


for the NLF.” North Vietnam and the
Viet Cong have given Mr. Kosygin and
Mr. Brezhnev their second chance, but
they have also limited their ability to
manoeuvre outside the confines pres-
cribed by Hanoi. This is probably the
message that U Thant brought back
from Moscow last week.
Vietnam War the fighting
High cost of Hue
THERE ARE PEOPLE in Hue who
look on its fate as a punishment. Since
the time of President Diem this stub-
born and beautiful city has not taken
kindly to the successive governments in
Saigon or to the Americans. For some,
it seems almost a matter of pride that
the price the city must now pay for its
liberation from the Viet Cong is its
own destruction.
Even the local Vietnamese authorities
have clashed with the Americans over
their use of firepower. “We had a
helluva job in the first few days,” said
an American officer. “There were
very few Vietnamese soldiers, so they
wanted the Marines to come in. But
they said we shouldn’t knock down this
temple and that house . . . but they
just had to go.”
It took a week’s fighting for a bat-
talion of Marines to more or less clear
the part of the city that lies south of
the Perfume River. This was the old
French residential and administrative
quarter, with handsome stuccoed build-
ings in the provincial style.
Branches from the carefully planted
trees lie along the roads. The animals
have escaped from the little zoo on
the river , bank and in their place are
three swollen Viet Cong corpses. The
modernistic “Cercle Sportif,” where the
Picture of communist soldiers in action,
released by the official North Vietna-
mese News Agency
Hue bourgeois held tennis tournaments
and drank whisky over old copies of
“Le Canard Enchaine” and “Le
Figaro,” looks like a battle-scarred pill-
box.
The main fighting then moved to
the walled citadel on the river’s north
bank, where one American Marine bat-
talion and well over a thousand Viet-
namese troops tried to close in on an
estimated 400 Viet Cong, but it was a
bloody and difficult business.
The Viet Cong were cunningly dug
into the southern part of the great
double wall of the citadel, built a
century and a half ago by French
engineers for Gia Long, the first
emperor of a united modern Vietnam.
The wall is some 20ft. high and, in
places, 14ft. thick.
American jet fighter-bombers with
5001 b. bombs, rocket-firing helicopters,
and Bin. naval guns pounded one of the
watchtowers where a Viet Cong rocket
and machine-gun emplacement held up
the Marines’ advance.
This part of the citadel is laid out
with little houses on a grid pattern.
The Marines swept through their neat
rooms like a crowd of rough schoolboys
invading a tiny tots’ birthday party,
opening drink cupboards, riding on
motor-scooters, picking up trophies.
Very young and tough, they think noth-
ing of standing six abreast in an open
street firing at a barely visible enemy,
like infantrymen in an old military
print.
A large statue of Buddha, sitting on
a carved wooden altar, watched over
the dark room where the Marines set
up their command post. It was hard to
remember that until, the Viet Cong
attack, Hue was a forbidden city to all
American troops:.
A few block behind the Marines’
front line, crowds of Vietnamese
wrapped up against the cold, were in
the streets to get a sight of the fight-
ing. They stared enigmatically at the
Americans. Some people stayed in their
houses, even at the front line, peering
out from time to time from behind
boarded windows.
A prisoner reported that 50 old
people and children had been left be-
hind in the area the Marines were
about to assault. Another prisoner said
the Viet Cong had taken an oath to
die behind their guns.
In the imperial city itself, a walled
rectangle within the southern part of
the citadel, about 30 Hue students were
helping the Viet Cong as porters and
ammunition carriers. They had put
machine-guns at its four gates, and
Vietnamese Marines were given the un-
pleasant task of assaulting it.
This is the most precious part of
the citadel, laid out by Gia Long to
ensure good fortune for the empire
and its rulers. Many of the palaces are
partly built of wood and set in elaborate
gardens that represent the world in
microcosm. When students came here
to work in the summer it had the air
of an oriental Oxford.
There was more to what the Viet
Cong did in Hue than this dramatic
last stand. Eventually, what will count
in Hue are the reactions of the people.
Today at least ten percent, probably
more, of the 140,000 inhabitants are
refugees who still do not really know
what has happened to them.
Franco-German relations
Nuclear partners?
BRITAIN is alarmed that the Germans
may have agreed to go into nuclear
partnership with General De Gaulle.
Secret Franco-German talks were held
in Paris last week.
The French need German financial
help for the plant at Pierrelatte, in
Southern France, which produces en-
riched uranium. This is the fuel widely
used for civilian reactors, but it is
also essential for producing H-bombs.
West Germany is developing a nuclear
industry, but is forbidden by treaty to
manufacture nuclear weapons on its
territory.
Originally, the General jealously-
guarded his nuclear' installations for
France alone. But it is now known
that, as a result of French exclusion
from Anglo-American technical know-
ledge, the French nuclear program is
taking longer and costing much more
than expected.
Until now France’s partners in the
Common Market have been unwilling
to get involved. Since the General’s
veto on Britain’s Common Market
application, the Dutch have refused to
attend meetings between the Six on
scientific and technological matters, and
these meetings have been suspended.
But it is plain from the Kiesinger-De
Gaulle communique that the Germans
now support France in insisting that
co-operation must go on in all fields
between the Six without waiting for
Britain.
In the view of some British experts,
the communique suggests that, for the
first time, the Germans have capitula-
ted to De Gaulle, in envisaging Britain’s
permanent exclusion from the Common
Market.
They point to the statement that
candidate members, “particularly Bri-
tain,” instead of joining, might “link
themselves with the Six in another
form.”
Herr Duckwitz, permanent head of
the German Foreign Ministry, will be
in London ' this week. George Brown
will ask him categorically if this is
true. He will also remind the Germans
that the only interim arrangements
acceptable to him are those which
advance Britain toward full member-
ship.
If Britain’s suspicions about a nuclear
agreement are well founded, they could
have consequences far beyond the Corn-


mon Market issues. There are no
indications that the General would open
Pierrelatte to international inspection.
Countries who participate would con-
sequently debar themselves from signing
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Pact
which imposes international control on
all enriched uranium installations.
“Europeanisation” of Pierrelatte
could be the first move toward West
German participation in the creation
of a European Nuclear deterrent. Brit-
ain had been hoping to become the
major European supplier of enriched
uranium for civilian use, through the
current enlargement of its own plant at
Capenhurst, in Cheshire. This has the
potential to meet all Coninental re-
quirements. The Italians had earlier
suggested that Capenhurst should be
handed over to a European consortium,
but the British preferred to retain con-
trol of the plant and export its surplus.
The Dutch say that the French plan
to get the Common Market to support
Pierrelatte goes back several months.
The Dutch Minister for Economic
Affairs, Herr de Block, has revealed
West German Chancellor Kurt
Keisinger and French President Charles
de Gaulle parted on friendly terms last
week
that he spent 12 solid hours in secret
conclave on December 8 fighting the
French.
Another Dutch Deputy, Herr de
Goede, formerly chief of the budget
division of the Netherlands Atomic
Energy Agency, has said a “European-
ised” Pierrelatte would cost between
£578 million find £BO9 million, of
which the Dutch would have to con-
tribute almost £7O million.
For the time being, the Germans get
their supplies of enriched uranium ex-
clusively from the Americans and are
actively interested in finding alterna-
tive sources.
The three possibilities are for them
to accept offers from Capenhurst, to set
up a new European separation plant on
the new centrifuge system, which the
Dutch say would be far cheaper, or to
join up with the French.
Malaysia
What does "significant aid" mean?
From HARVEY STOCKWIN in Kuala Lumpur
ONE MAJOR problem accentuated by
the accelerated British withdrawal is
that of the “significant aid” Britain
will now have to give to offset economic
dislocation. Earlier discussions between
the Malaysian and Singapore Govern-
ments and the British hinged, of course,
on the 1975 deadline and even then
they threatened to run into a squall
when resumed in the next few months.
Given the 1971 deadline, it would not
be unreasonable to anticipate a major
storm. In turn, such an eventuality
might cause the PAP and Alliance
Governments to themselves take the
anti-British stance they have so far
refrained from taking.
The problem in relation to Malaysia
is at least relatively simple in that it
will not be difficult to find projects
for the British to support. Indeed,
were Whitehall to decide that the style
of departure was to be much better
than the announcement of it, and were
imaginative and significant projects to
be decided upon as Anglo-Malaysian
ventures, that much good could be
accomplished all round. The British
could decide, for example, that even
as they brought rubber plantations with
them as they came in, so they would
leave behind rice plantations as they
go out. The latest advances in rice
technology make plantations definitely
feasible moves are already afoot to
create such in the Philippines and
such intensive-extensive rice cultivation
would the quicker create Malaysian self
sufficiency with consequent foreign ex-
change savings. Alternatively, the Brit-
ish might finance and equip a large-
scale rural development scheme at
a time when the Malaysians, due to
the plummeting rubber price, have to
cut back their own plans even though
the rubber collapse leads to a widening
of the rural urban wealth gap.
Reading between the lines of Tun
Siew Sin’s Budget, one may infer that
imaginative proposals such as these have
not yet been considered. Siew Sin
described the one million pounds ster-
ling paid so far as “only a token pay-
ment” (a similar token has been given
to Singapore). Noting the Malaysian
view of such aid as taking the form
of grants and soft loans, while the
British view would also consider
encouraging private investment as aid,
the Malaysian Finance Minister stressed
“a difference of some magnitude
between aid and private investment.”
He maintained “a formula would have
to be worked out” to correct this differ-
ence since “one dollar’s worth of such
investment would be equivalent to very
much less than one dollar’s worth of
pure aid such as a direct financial
grant.”
Siew Sin’s cousin across the cause-
way, Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee,
made a similar point much more
brusquely at the time of earlier Anglo-
Singapore discussions on the aid ques-
tion. Evidently the British mission
leader was misquoted at the airport,
but the misquotation was enough to
cause Dr. Goh to give a strongly
worded Press conference at which he
conveyed the impression that he
scarcely considered investment aid at
all.
Unless the British just give a straight-
forward grant and let the Singaporeans
use it how they will, the big problem
vis-a-vis Singapore is how to give aid
that will keep the unemployment figures
within bounds. Obviously, Singapore
could use any grants it gets, to go into
joint partnership with foreign firms on
industrial ventures. So far, PAP social-
ism notwithstanding, it had been rele-
vant to further State intervention in
industrialisation, though the Economic
Development Board has some minority
holdings in joint ventures. Beyond this,
there is the additional problem of get-
ting firms interested, especially inter-
national companies with long-term views
as against the local or Hong Kong in-
vestors, who unhappily, usually have
too strong a preference for short-term
returns.
Obviously Britain could help by
making Singapore equivalent to a “de-
pressed area” in Britain, investment in
which can entitle firms to Government
loans. As for Malaysia, so for Sing-
apore British loans to help their in-
dustrialists make money is only “aid”
up to a point but then neither
country will sniff at it. In both cases
however, but particularly in the case
of Singapore, there is the additional
problem of markets. Since the ultimate
good sense of a Malaysian-Singapore
common market is well outside the
compass of either country’s available
statesmanship, this would seem to leave
the British in the position of having to
give Singapore at least quotas for their
manufacturers as part of an aid pack-
age. With all other South-East Asian
countries pursuing industrialisation for
themselves, it still seems unlikely that
the investment in export oriented in-
dustries (the Singapore market being
so small) will be forthcoming from
Britain—or anywhere else—unless this
is so.
All this begs the additional question
of whether industrialisation will pick
up the unemployment slack. The sad
fact is that modern military bases are
still labor intensive, whereas a factory
filled with modern machinery is very
often not.
Thus the aid question bristles with
difficulties, even if the British are able
and willing to start from a generous
position in the first place. This being
so, it would seem unwise for the nego-
tiations to be solely handled on the
British side by a civil servant, even if


a high official of the Overseas Develop-
ment Ministry, Sir Alan Dudley. The
aid question is already a political hot
potato, with the likelihood being it will
get hotter. The appointment of a
British Minister to lead the next round
of talks would therefore not only dim-
inish the risk of further friction. It
would help convince the Malaysians
and Singaporeans that, on the issue of
significant aid, the English word was
still their bond.
Singapore
No opposition
THE 1968 general election in Singapore
will go down in history as the very
first to be won on nomination day.
Fifty-one of the 58 Parliamentary con-
stituencies today returned Peoples’
Action Party candidates unopposed. Of
Cabinet Ministers only Lee Kuan Yew
had a fight on his hands. In Lee’s
constituency a lone Independent filed
his papers.
As for the rest of the opposition,
while during last week there were some
protestations of intent to contest, when
the time came they funked it. Even
the Barisan Socialists will now be
frustrated. Having decided to boycott
the election they were instead mount-
ing a “Don’t-vote” campaign. Now there
is hardly any voting for them to
campaign against.
Korea
Appeasement
PRESIDENT JOHNSON has made at
least three concessions to outraged
South Korean sensibilities since the
anti-American demonstrations in Seoul
last week. He has asked Congress for
an immediate appropriation of $lOO
million of military aid, on top of the
$l5O million to $2OO million that Korea
already gets. He despatched his per-
sonal trouble-shooter, Mr. Cyrus Vance,
to talk,soothing words to President Park
Chung Hee about the “grave threat”
from the North. Then he ordered his
spokesmen at Panmunjom to break off
their closed-door negotiations with the
North Koreans and to start discussing
South Korean grievances at an open
meeting of the armistice commission.
But the South Koreans are not yet
fully appeased. They are very much
afraid that America’s cool-tempered
handling of the Pueblo crisis will allow
Marshal Kim II Sung to emerge un-
scathed and unrepentant as the hero
of the day. So they want America to
shake its fist at him either by
threatening to repudiate the 1953
armistice pact or by issuing an angry
warning against continuing communist
sabotage. What they would like most
of all is for America to sanction puni-
tive raids across the 38th parallel. The
North Koreans claim it has already
done this. But Thursday’s statement
showed that Mr. Vance has not given
the South Koreans all they want.
America needs to keep on talking terms
with North Korea.
So far all that the talks with the
North Koreans have produced are the
names of the one sailor killed and the
three injured when the Pueblo was
captured. A South Korean newspaper
reported this week that the American
prisoners had been moved from
Pyongyang to a village near Pan-
munjom in readiness for their return.
Meanwhile, the North Koreans have
continued to accumulate propaganda
points by releasing “confessions” from
the ship’s officers.
White attempting to prod or black-
mail the Americans into taking up a
more militant stance, South Korea’s
leaders have been doing what they can
to strengthen their own defences.
President Park has added six months
to the terms of duty of all 600,000 men
in his armed forces. He now proposes
South Korean soldiers at the border outpost of Song Chu near the demilitarised
zone. The photographer who took the picture was one of 65 foreign correspondents
who inspected border posts at the invitation of the South Korean Government
this month
to arm the 2.5 million reservists in his
national militia. Whatever Washington
decides, Seoul is determined to go on
shaking its own fist in North Korea’s
direction.
Indonesia
Cutting off their
nose . . .
FEAR IS MOUNTING of another
bloody pogrom in Indonesian West
Borneo, where last November more
than 100 Chinese were killed and
40,000 driven from their homes. About
450 Chinese refugees were this week
reported to have -died in overcrowded
emergency camps in the coastal towns
of Pontianak and Sinkawang.
A new threat is now posed by the
primitive Dyak tribesmen who launched
the last attacks, in which Chinese
families were butchered and others
burnt in their homes as they slept. The
livers of some were cut from their
bodies and eaten by the Dyaks, who
believe this wards off the avenging spirit
of the dead man and transfers his
strength to his killer.
A handful of Chinese who dared to
return to their houses after the
slaughter were killed and their heads
posted on stakes at the eryrance to their
villages as a warning.
After the slaughter, all Chinese were
expelled from the interior. This has
now sown the seeds of further disorder,
for without the Chinese the whole
economic base of the Dyaks’ primitive
forest life has collapsed. Soon they will
be starving. And then, if not before, it
is feared they will go on new raids
against the Chinese.
Almost all trade in the interior was
in the hands of the Chinese, who
formed the majority of farmers in many
rice-growing areas. Now no one
remains to barter food and other essen-
tial supplies for the rubber collected
by the Dyaks from wild jungle rubber
trees. Rice production has been cut
substantially and shortages are pre-
dicted: the Dyaks have lost their
livelihood.
Although conditions for Indonesia’s
three million Chinese are worst in
West Borneo, thousands also live in
terror and misery in Northern Sumatra.
There “integration” often proceeds
virtually at gunpoint. Chinese have
been forced to marry their children to
Indonesians. Chinese culture is
smothered and celebrating Chinese
holidays or speaking Chinese in public
is prohibited. About 3000 Chinese are
in refugee camps in Medan, awaiting
repatriation to China—the last of 8000
expelled from the province of Atjeh
by Muslim and Army extremists more
than a year ago.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The ups and downs of American
and British investments
THE UTTER COLLAPSE of direct
British investment in Australian com-
panies last year and the severe fall in
American portfolio investment could
hardly have come at a better time. For
the $47 million (or almost 40 percent)
reduction in U.S. investment on Aus-
tralian stock exchanges in 1966-67
meant the removal of a potentially
explosive amount of buying pressure at
a time when we were just beginning to
discover what our minerals future
meant to us.
And the slashing of new direct
British investment (excluding undistri-
buted income from existing operations
here) by $l2l million to only $33
million certainly kept in check the pace
of economic advance.
In any event, the British withdrawal
from direct investment (offset a little
by a $l5 million or 12 percent rise for
direct capital inflow from America) was
the main reason for the 25 percent drop
in Australia’s total inflow of private
investment money from overseas last
year. It is striking that the two coun-
tries with official restraints on their
exports of funds here, Britain and
America, and which supply the bulk
of our investment from overseas, re-
sponded so differently to the situation:
the U.S. slashed its portfolio and raised
its direct investment; Britain slashed
its direct investment and spent another
$8 million here on listed shares.
They have also responded differently
in the amount of income they leave
undistributed in Australia. The British
proportion of profits earned on direct
investment in Australia that are re-
patriated has risen over the past four
years from 40 percent to 60 percent;
Hovermarine’s latest “sidewall” hovercraft ... a suitable ferry for Sydneysiders?
the American has fallen from almost 70
percent to 57 percent (although last
year there was a clear rise, as the pro-
portion had got down to about 50 per-
cent in 1965-66). The net result of all
this was that British investment here
overall was cut almost in half to
$137 million; that from the U.S. was
cut by 12 percent to $263 million
almost double Britain’s, and still its
second-best result.
The industries most affected by the
overall 35 percent fall in direct invest-
ment from all sources to $291 million
were oil distribution, down $46 million
from the previous year to turn a $34
million inflow into an outflow of $l2
million; mining and chemicals, both
down $24 million (but still leaving the
inflow for mining, at $57 million, one
of the best ever); commerce, down $2O
million; vehicles, down $ll million;
and insurance, banking, and property,
down $lB million. The few to show
rises were oil exploration (up $7 mil-
lion to $37 million), engineering (up
$2 million to $l9 million), and build-
ing and construction (up $5 million to
$l2 million).
Hovercraft
Future prospects
HOVERCRAFT WERE REJECTED
for Sydney Harbor two years ago be-
cause they cost too much and made
too much noise. But now there are
real prospects that 400 people at a
load could be brought to the city from
Manly or Parramatta across debris-
littered water in less time than it takes
to smoke a leisurely cigarette. For the
British makers have lowered the noise
level along with the running costs, just
about doubled the speed and the carry-
ing capacity, and cut the selling price
by half. British Rail will shortly be
using one of the latest models of
Hovermarine Ltd. costing $137,145
and carrying 65 passengers at 50 knots
on the Portsmouth-Isle of Wight sea
crossing. The theoretical fare from
Parramatta to Circular Quay has
dropped from $2.50 in the best hover-
craft available in 1966 to the region of
50 The New South Wales Gov-
ernment is taking interest again.
Hovermarine is interested in Aus-
tralia: “This form of transport seems
to be the thing of the future for Aus-
tralian conditions,” says Mr. N. D.
Piper, the company’s managing director,
who would like to bolster his claim
with some demonstrations on Sydney
Harbor and, possibly, Port Phillip Bay.
Mr. Piper is also reported to be in
favor of a partnership in an Australian
firm “which has a water-site for a
manufacturing plant, a suitably skilled
labor force, and at least $lOO,OOO to
put into the project.”
Hovermarine’s craft operate on the
“sidewall” principal, the main body
being lifted clear of the waves by a
cushion of air, but with two sides
always in contact with the water a
sort of hybrid hovercraft-hydrofoil,
though the company has no doubts that
the hybrid will easily outclass the
hydrofoil. The advantages over thq
hovercraft proper are quietness and
cheapness of operation, though less
speed, despite being twice as fast as
any conventional ship.
The greater manoeuvrability and
speed of the pure hovercraft excludes
Hovermarine from much of the poten-
tially large military market. Never-
theless, the commercial transportation
of passengers and freight in particular
parts of the world from an Aus-
tralian base, Hovermarine anticipate
markets in South-East Asia and the
Pacific —should offer more than enough
possibilities, for which the company is
intent on expanding its range of craft.
At present a 70-ton car ferry and a
125-ton craft for carrying 400 pas-
sengers are under development and
there is an ultimate dream of some-
thing in the 1000-ton range. By the
time the New South Wales Govern-
ment and the Port Jackson and Manly
Steamship Company get around to
making their minds up, there should
be a good selection to choose from.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy : Rural exports should earn $ 1825 m.
in 1967-68, about 9 percent lower than last year, although
the volume would be only slightly smaller . . . The Common-
wealth Government is considering a scheme to assist 24,000
marginal dairyfarmers voluntarily to leave the land, and
allow amalgamation of farms . . . The Reserve Bank
announced a further increase of s4om. in term loan funds
of major trading banks . . . Savings bank deposits climbed
10.1 percent last year.
On a tense industrial scene, metal trades employers asked
the full bench of the Arbitration Commission to set aside
the new wage rates, and the ACTU industrial committee
called for stoppages by 1,200,000 members of the ACTU’s
98 affiliated unions in support of the metal unions in their
pay dispute.
For the markets : Weakness developed on Australian
mining and oil markets from Tuesday, with investors in-
clined to take their profits on speculations and transfer
funds to industrials, because of concern over future British
buying of Australian miners.
Recent warnings from the White House that the economy
is in dangerous territory upset Wall Street traders, who are
still in cautious mood in view of Vietnam developments
. . . Industrial stocks drifted irregularly lower in London,
where Australian nickels also lost ground.
For companies : Interim reports, now flooding in, have
generally been better than expected by a dull non-mining
market, although two big unlisted companies did worse as
GM-H had its fourth successive year’s decline in earnings
to $20.3m., lowest since 1957, and Alcan Australia, subsidiary
of the Canadian Alcan, fell into the red in 1967 . . . S. A.
Rubber did better in building, A. V. Jennings achieved
record results, turnover up and profit up from an adjusted
$544,000 to $839,000, after much bigger tax . . . PGH sales
were up marginally, but earnings declined; interim dividend
not yet announced . . . Overseas Corporation’s sales and
profits increased by 10 percent . . . Dural Leeds will finance
expansion with a one-for-ten par issue; turnover tor the
December half was up 2J percent and profit substantially
better than that.
Big Sister has indicated an increase in annual dividend
from 15 to 20 percent with interim dividend of 10 percent
after higher sales and profits . . . Protector Safety Industries
is paying out more ... so is Julius Marlow (annual rate
up from 11 to 14 percent) as profits jumped 26 percent . . .
but DHA cut its interim from 4| to 4 percent when profit
fell on slightly lower volume of sales, and pressure of higher
wages . . . Larke expects to maintain the 15 percent divi-
dend after a one-for-ten bonus . . . Hackshall’s expects to
lift dividend from 15 to 16 percent on capital enlarged by
a one-for-four bonus . . . the International Combustion
chairman hinted at a bonus.
Bradmill hoisted profit 37 percent . . . Jaques Bros,
(crushing, mining, and construction equipment) and OPSM
(spectacles) both reported better turnovers and profits, as
did Swift, Huttons, and Allens Confectionery, but Peters-
ville suffered a setback . . . the broadcasting boom continued
with Macquarie reporting substantially higher sales and
profits . . . Ampol’s 1967-68 year should be a good one,
judging by results for the four months to January, which are
in excess of budget. Even after providing for tax, which
the company does not expect to pay because of investment
allowances, the net result will be higher.
MEN AND MATTERS
AUSTRALIA’S TRADE with Romania
is so small that the Commonwealth
Statistician puts it among the also rans
in his statistics. But, thanks to the
efforts of Mr. McEwen, it is bucking
up. Last year he made a trade agree-
ment with Romania which is already
bearing fruit by way of an order for
$7B million worth of wool tops, the
weight of which represents about 18J
percent of our total tops exports last
year. Handling the order this end, in
Melbourne, is 39-year-old engineer Mr.
Lou Rocka, one of the few Romanian-
born businessmen in Australia. More
in the public eye up to this for his
hard-cash supported fervor for the
Geelong Football Club, he is also known
around the place for the extensive en-
gineering business he has built up from
headquarters in Huntington, by medium
of several proprietaries.
Although only ten when the war
broke out, Rocka finished it as a forced
laborer in Austria, where he was at
school for four years. In 1949 he came
here, and, three years later, after being
naturalised, married a Geelong girl
while working as an interpreter at the
local fertiliser company. With a bit of
early engineering training up his sleeve,
he started his own structural steel busi-
ness. A frequent commutor with
Romania, he has built up a considerable
agency business for Romanian oil drill-
ing equipment, industrial machinery,
chemicals, and various other products.
The new trade agreement with his
country has been a shot in the arm for
him, and, with the encouragement of
the Government, his new role as Aus-
tralian trade representative for Romania
promises further pay-offs, especially in
new orders for industrial machinery,
which he is seeking. Taking an interest
in the fruits will be a growing family
of one son, aged 13, and two daughters,
the youngest rising two.
WHETHER THE MARQUIS OF
LINCOLNSHIRE regarded his
appointment to the Governorship of
New South Wales in 1885 as a boon or
a bane is no longer of importance. But
in that it led through a family chain
of Anglo-Australian relationships to the
appointment of his great-grandson as
Chairman of the A.N.Z. Bank it is prov-
ing a boon during the present period
of mutual reappraisal to Britain and
Australia alike.
Lord Carrington has arrived on his
annual antipodean visit “to keep in
repair my political friendships,” a mis-
sion to which he is well accustomed,
having been British High Commissioner
in Canberra between 1956 and 1959.
He is here, too, as a banker fresh from
the recent banking mergers in London
—he is a director of Hambros and
Barclays—willing to discuss the possible
dangers that might await the banking
scene here should the American giants,
at present gathering on the doorstep,
Lord Carrington
Lou Rocka
be let in by the Federal Government.
His Lordship fears no such admittance.
He is himself a keen observer of Ameri-
can banking methods, and in Richard
Wheeler-Bennett he has an executive
director who has spent five years with
the National City Bank of New York.
“We will be equipped to compete on
more than equal terms.” And such is
his eloquent confidence that even the
Americans should be convinced.
Supremely tactful, witty, and prin-
cipled, Lord Carrington is a product
of the traditional and alchemical melt-
ing pots of Eton, Sandhurst, and the
Grenadier Guards. In that similar
products, grey-faced in the City of
London, still control something like
half of the world’s trade, Lord Car-
rington was here to silently tell us that
Britain was far from little yet.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Toward a better
understanding
of Britain
BY J. C. HORSFALL
LOOKING AROUND THE WORLD,
economic containment is much more in
vogue than expansion, so it wasn’t all
that surprising to hear Mr. Gorton tell
the electors of Higgins last week that
a minerals’ Eldorado is not just around
the corner. Filling in the blanks left
in his recent Brisbane exposition of
national priorities over resources, Gor-
ton spelt it out in unequivocal terms
that whatever his ultimate potential as
a provider he could not offer guaran-
tees of an early diet of economic bliss
or a full stomach of domestic develop-
ment, despite the public’s main
economic concern for full employment
and rising living standards.
The nastiest poison in our present
economic mix is an unpredictable com-
mitment for defence expenditure. Gor-
ton made no bones about that. Some-
what ironically, this, to a large extent,
arises from the fact that the British
withdrawal from Malaysia and Singa-
pore has been advanced to 1971. Here
we have been going on our merry pros-
perous economic way and, most of us,
selling Britain short in all directions,
economically, politically, and other-
wise, while that country has been
gratuitously providing one of our main
•defence shields. There is a sort of
prodigal son twist to the situation.
Obviously, we can’t expect Britain to
kill the fatted calf, indeed the contrary.
It looks as if we shall have to sacrifice
something of our own development.
The more one looks at it, Britain,
now undertaking a massive containment
operation soon to be pressed a stage
further in the Budget on March 19, is
going to have the last economic laugh.
This also seemed to be the view of
Lord Cato, the former Governor of the
Bank of England, who told friends in
Melbourne recently that the adjust-
ment’s Britain had to make were in
fact of a marginal, three to four per-
cent order which when completed
would, remembering that Britain no
longer essays independent battle roles
around the world, re-established ster-
ling as a strong reserve currency. (It
has been estimated by the U.K.
National Institute of Economic Re-
search that the volume of British ex-
ports will rise as much as 35 percent
for some of the major export groups
as a result of devaluation —no wonder
Japanese businessmen have been
politely drawing our attention to the
big advantages Britain enjoys in our
market under the British preferential
tariff!)
We’ve tended to underestimate the
efficiency of the British economy here
in recent years, mainly perhaps because
of the British genius for overstating
their troubles and understating their
successes. It was surprising, for instance,
to find Donald Cochrane, Professor of
Economics at Monash University, blam-
ing British inefficiency for devalua-
tion, This is far from the truth, unless
he was referring not to British industry
as such but to all the appendages of
deadwood in the British community
which have for so long distorted the
reflection of the country’s industrial
efficiency in the mirror of national
viability.
The truth is, of course, that far too
many people in Britain are living on
outmoded economic privilege. Not
that these are by any means accounted
for by inherited wealth typified by those
who, as the saying used to go, “live on
the funds.” The place is also stiff with
people living on pensions—the deepest
canker of the British economic structure
—annuities and other entitlements
acquired over the ages of Britain’s
military and economic power. Now,
with the underlying economic security
of the country imperilled by the series
of shattering events since 1939, their
relative burden on the economy has
been increased immeasurably.
Considering the strained circum-
stances of sterling and the over-
stretched domestic economy when Mr.
Wilson took over in October, 1964
(when he turned his back against imme-
diate devaluation despite strong
advice), it is a little surprising that de-
valuation last year is the only major
blot on the record. Even if slow, some
economic progress has been made over
the first three years of Wilson’s premier-
ship despite the fact that the welfare
state has been kept intact, most of the
social nonsenses are rampant, and very
little of the deadwood has been re-
moved. Somehow about percent has
been added to gross domestic product
measured in real terms and with a 7
percent increase in imports and some
net rundown in stocks over the period,
rather more than an additional 4 per-
cent of goods and services were avail-
able to the economy.
It turned out that consumption in
Britain rose by slightly more than 4|
percent, private investment fell by 6
percent, exports rose by 6 percent, and
public expenditure rose by 16 percent,
remembering that the performance is
being measured in real terms. Even if
this performance doesn’t match ours by
a very long shot (except, say, in the
direction of Government expenditure),
at least it belies the taunt so often heard
that Britain has had it, despite the des-
pairing judgments handed out by
London’s own economic pundits—the
NEDG had set up a brave target of
4 percent for the growth rate compared
with the one percent achieved, the
target for private fixed investment had
been put at 4 percent a year and that
for exports at 5 percent.
There may still be a lot of people
around the world eager to sell short
both sterling and the British economy,
and before these hounds call it off
Britain may well have a crisis or two to
contend with. However, it should be
better understood than it appears to be
here that these crises, and those before
them, will not derive from some inate
inefficiency in British industry itself but
rather from the pitfalls which beset a
country whose currency is used to
finance more than half the world’s
trade; to an economy still in transition
toward a new focus in its external
arrangements as well as its domestic
ones; to an economy which, if you like,
has been shrinking in significance in its
world relationships. We are witnessing,
certainly, a reduced Britain, and per-
haps its main chance of reasserting itself
on the world’s economic stage lies in
getting into the Common Market.
4 here’s still a lot of economic rot
and deadwood to get rid of in Britain
before the tremendous efficiency of
British industry can reassert its com-
petitive strength to full effect on the
country’s external viability. But ulti-
mately the decks will be cleared for
full steam ahead on the domestic and
foreign courses that it’s present Gov-
ernment have set and from which it is
now unlikely that there would be much
backtracking, whatever party was in
power there. We should take a measure
of reassurance from this here, for even
if our economic relationships with
Britain have a vestige of their former
significance, as we grow in economic
strength we will be looking for new
markets all round the globe. Britain,
for its own potential and as a doorstep
into Europe, may well turn out to be as
lucrative as any, even Japan, in the
long run as in the past.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
An excellent
chance of a
high return
AFTER A SHORT SIMMER oil is
again on the boil. The Sydney Stock
Exchange’s recent record turnover of
4.1 million shares included 1.5 million
industrials, 0.8 million minerals, and
the remainder oils. How frantic this
really was doesn’t hit home until you
realise that oils represent a mere 4
percent in numbers of the quoted stocks.
One stock I’ve been watching with
an eagle-eye is my old friend of 1967,
Amalgamated Petroleum. It currently
gives every indication of being a goer.
Since the middle of January it has
moved consistently upwards. It faulted
by a round two cents during the gen-
eral easing a few weeks ago, but has
since quickly picked up and is again
on its way. Its upward trend has
been supported by heavy turnover
(always a healthy sign) and the stock
is now one of the regulars on the top
forty turnover lists. After a close look
the reasons for its popularity are not
hard to see. Firstly, Amalgamated has
got something that most other oil stocks
haven’t. It’s got an income. Oil from
its Trinidad wells in the Roma area
is being sold (as yet in modest quan-
tities) to Union-Kern at U.S. $3.50 a
barrel (the same price as Moonie
crude) less the cost of transporting the
oil to the Moonie pipeline.
Better still, it will soon have even
more income.
Last September it signed a contract
with Associated Pipelines for the daily
supply of 600,000 cubic feet of natural
gas for a period of 15 years. Delivery
begins as soon as the pipeline from
Roma to Brisbane swings into action.
This will be some time during 1969.
While on the subject of income it is
worth mentioning that Amalgamated
stands to receive up to $500,000 in
royalties on any petroleum discovered
at the Ashmore Reef. The rights to this
area were sold off last year for $BOOO
to the Burmah-Shell-Woodside Group
on the basis that Amalgamated would
share in any finds.
The latter group is presently busily
searching the area for prospects.
Another reason for the adulation of
Amalgamated is its half interest in oil
rights to 1700 square miles of the More-
ton Bay area just north of Brisbane.
A marine seismic survey is currently
being carried out in this area and the
results are expected in about three
weeks (which will mean another run-
up in the stock at around that time).
From the point of view of explora-
tion Amalgamated is double value
through its half-million shareholding
in Timor Oil. If Timor hits the jackpot
with oil in Portuguese Timor (where
prospects currently look hot), or cracks
it with its mineral exploration in
Western Australia (where nickel is the
magic whisper), Amalgamated will
have it made. Doubly so, in fact, be-
cause Amalgamated has an option to
take up another half-million shares if
anything worthwhile happens over the
next five years.
On the mineral side, Amalgamated
may itself hit the jackpot. It is cur-
rently having a geographical check on
its new leases covering 500 square miles
north of Leonora in Western Australia.
And who knows? Its rights cover a
wide range of minerals, including
copper, silver, lead, and nickel.
All these bull points, plus the cur-
rently active oil market, have well and
truly sold me on the company. Its 16-
cent paid shares at 18 cents (just
2 cents over par) were hard to resist. I
bought 15,000. Chances of a high
return are excellent. A six-cent rise
(which is a moderate goal in today’s
market) means a quick 30 percent
profit. A nine-cent rise is a 50 percent
profit. It is also encouraging to know
that H. C. Sleigh and the Associated
Group are substantial fellow share-
holders (Mr. Sleigh is chairman of the
company).

Is it time to take stock?
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
IT’S ALL A question of timing. Un-
less the mining boom can be kept fed
with good news (or good rumors), it
must wither sooner or later. There is
some chance that the supply of good
news may be kept up for a while
yet, at least for some stocks; but not
all can live forever on crossecf fingers.
In any event, it is not only the mining
market that faces some sort of down-
ward pressure, as has been said here
several times this year.
And then, despite the way it looks
on a map, Australia is not an island;
any sudden changes in Britain and U.S.
investment patterns will certainly have
an impact here and not just in
sympathy, since foreign funds have been
taking a big role in the mining boom.
The problem is not only a local one.
There is a pretty widely held view that
unless British investment here slows
down of its own accord, there could
well be some savage restraints on it
in Britain s April budget that would be
far more effective than those already
having a sizable impact. Either way,
the supply of cash from Britain could
take a knock.
As for America, well there are
prophets of doom prepared to fore-
cast a serious downturn for Wall Street
this year. Already the Dow Jones has
suffered a “mini-collapse,” with prices
at their lowest point for more than a
year and about 12 percent below their
1967 high of five months ago. Accord-
ing to the Cowan Investment Survey,
the Dow Jones index is now in what
it describes in chartists’ terms as “the
most bearish looking head and
shoulders pattern imaginable. By all
technical analytical standards, the Dow
Jones index is now poised for a steep
fall.”
The Cowan service, as a result,
counsels Australian investors to exer-
cise great care. If the Dow Jones does
take a massive tumble, “then you may
expect to see a sizable correction in
this country also.” So it advises its
clients to maintain their position in
counter-cyclical gold stocks and to
watch the action from the sidelines
until the position clarifies itself. It
does not urge panic selling; simply
some profit-taking, but the
major portion of first-class mineral
investments undisturbed. “Today is
not the time to buy except in isolated
instances” until the implications of this
major U.S. bear sign unfold.
NO MATTER WHAT is happening
elsewhere, the stock-options post has
still managed to keep up a very confi-
dent appearance. On top of the usual
masses of call options written (particu-
larly for six months) on mining and oil
stocks, there was an interesting collec-
tion of industrials in the list of those
being traded in the 1000 and upward
class last week.
Despite its denial of negotiations and
its lower interim result, Petersville was
in very strong demand. And there was
also volume business done in such re-
covery prospects as Universal Textiles
(which looks unbelievably cheap at 60
cents; but then we thought they looked
good at 90 cents!), Olympic, LNC, and
Blakistons. And if Ampol can be
classed as industrial rather than an oil-
searching share, there was some interest
there, too. Boral also attracted some
attention. There is no doubt that the
prospects of Ampol and Boral, two
Australian companies in an area domin-
ated by international giants, have be-
come intriguing following the large oil
discoveries made here in recent times.
What is BHP going to do with its oil?
Or Esso?
Apart from the marketing questions,
there is no doubt that speculative in-
terest in the search for oil (and
minerals) is still strong. Oil Search,
with its 45,000 options, led last week’s
field as the Phillips drilling in a Papuan
offshore tenement adjacent to Oil
Search’s is providing valuable assist-
ance in assessing the prospects in Oil
Search’s holding, apart from providing
a few thrills on rumors (since denied
by Phillips) of oil strikes. This week
could see some interesting news from
this region, as work proceeds after a
lull.
Others to feature prominently in call
options trading included BHP, as usual;
Ravenshoe, which looks to be beginning
The Chartist says:
CLEVELAND TIN N.L. is a stock in a promising growth situation for those
investors whose attention is turning to tin. The chart, since listing in October,
1966, shows an uptrend at an appreciation rate of 140 percent per annum, and
although the stock is at present in a reaction stage from the fast rise since the
beginning of the year, the overall base suggests that prices will eventually move up
to approximately the $2.70 level. Last sale price on 15/2/68 —$1.22.

tion on that account, and when it pro-
vides concrete evidence, such as A. V.
Jennings (which already has 214 houses
there to its construction credit), the
Melbourne-based nation-wide builder,
did last week of being on the flood tide
in so many other directions, it is time
to sit up and take notice, that is, for
those who have a moment to spare from
minerals counters. True, the 50-cent
shares had already come up from $1.75
to $2.08 this year in quiet expectation
of a good result for the latest half year
and have since been taken up a further
12 cents or so since the interim. But
there is so much in the Jennings pot
that even with the shares yielding only
2.7 percent (but how much are
Western Mining and all the other nickel
favorites yielding at the moment, some
with merely a lot of pie in the sky?)
Forget about the meagre dividend
yield (the interim was held at 6 percent
to keep last year’s 12 percent annual
rate intact) and look at the dividend
cover of just over 48 percent based on
the last half year’s lift in net profit of
roughly 54 percent over the correspond-
ing half year 1966-67, when for the
year earnings came out at 41.6 percent.
Judging by the work in hand the shares
could well be showing something even
better than a four times earnings cover
when the full results for 1967-68 are
to hand in August to underline even
more than at present the scope for a
higher payout. At December 31 last, the
group’s uncompleted contracting and
housing work totalled $33.4 million
($29 million six months earlier) and on
top of that it had signed contracts and
sales orders for $38.5 million, up $7.2
million on June 30 last.
All this reflects the current strength
of the house-building industry, where
up to this A. V. Jennings has made its
most striking profit gains. The coast
still looks very clear for housing this
year, and with all the fire in our

development belly there’s no gainsaying
its longer-term prospects, given, of
course, the ups and downs character-
istic of the industry in the past. What
may be bothering some people in the
profit prospects is the type of venture
A. V. Jennings began to undertake
recently in office-block construction in
co-operation with the U.K. group
Town and City Properties Ltd. Here
some comfort may be had from the fact
that it happens that the first block being
built by this combination is in William
Street (Melbourne), where just down
the road E. A. Watts is putting up the
St. James building for the AMP.
E. A. Watts is, of course, the locally
listed king (since 1964) of the big
office business into which Jennings has
recently made its first essay. In fact,
there are only two other firms in Mel-
bourne who are at present geared for
contracts over $3 million or so in this
field (Lewis, and Hansen & Yunken,
both proprietaries). Jennings’ William
Street contract is believed to be well
under the $3 million mark, but obvi-
ously it will build up to higher figures
with experience. From the investment
angle it looks likely—going on the E. A.
Watts experience (about 80 percent
of Watts’ $9O-million order book is
commercial and 20 percent in industrial
building and construction, and it is
booked out for two years)—to be a
lucrative line for Jennings.
Some doubts have been raised con-
cerning the drag on construction and
building companies, especially in the
big league of office-block construction,
of industrial unrest, which it has been
rumored has affected E. A. Watts.
Checking up on this it transpires that
the loss to E. A. Watts’ productivity
(less prosaically, earnings) from indus-
trial disputes has been pretty minimal.
In fact, taken over all Watts’ workforce,
the number of idle days was only 14
in both 1965-66 and 1966-67, and for
seven months this year eight days 5 \
hours. Admittedly, as recognised in its
latest report, the company had “foun-
dations” (in the physical sense) at its
$2O million St. James job, but these
were over and done with a long time
ago. Nobody knows what industrial
trouble has in store anywhere around
the place, what with all the rough and
tumble going on in that direction. But
it should be no worse in the building
trades than anywhere else, one should
think.
Moreover, there’s still a great deal
of puff in the building business quite
apart from housing. So as well as
Jennings it could well pay to take a
look at E. A. Watts (whose interim
is coming to hand next week) for its
own sake. It would be surprising to
this column if its earnings came out
under 45 percent, a figure which would
improve on last year’s 41.6, which in
itself was an advance on the 38.5 and
23.7 of the two previous years since
the company came to the exchange.
One would also expect the assets back-
ing to the shares to improve to, say,
97 cents a share, which would compare
with 82, 67, 53, and 45 cents in the
four years of its stock-exchange exist-
ence. So, for comparative purposes, it
hasn’t quite as strong a position as
A. V. Jennings on this score, but there
isn’t all that in it on the earnings
front.
The most significant difference is that
E. A. Watts, at the current price of
116 cents with a dividend the same as
Jennings’ 12 percent, offers a dividend
yield of 5.2 percent, or just about
double that on the Jennings shares.
This year Watts have moved within
the range of a dollar and 116 cents.
Of its full order book Watts has still
$55 million worth of contracts to com-
plete compared with Jennings’ $34.3.
million. These are dispersed throughout
the country from St. James ($2O mil-
lion), Footscray fruit market ($7 mil-
lion), and Drummonds’ Collins Street
site ($5 million) in Melbourne, to
municipal and State Government offices
in Sydney ($ll million), Brisbane State
Government offices and the T. & G.
building ($lO million), and Tasmanian
Government Offices in Hobart ($3 mil-
lion) to name the biggest.

Behind the balance sheets
The candy-mint-with-a-hole
hits some hard times
IT HAS NOT BEEN a happy time for
Life Savers (Australasia) Ltd. This
month its shares fell below $2 for the
first time in nine years; it missed out
to James Stedman in the important
takeover battle for Hoadleys; its pro-
fits have been slipping as costs par-
ticularly of cocoa, but also of sugar
and wages —have been soaring and cut-
price supermarket selling has slashed
profit margins; and there is the grow-
ing threat of more foreign-owned
rivals setting up here to worsen the
already keen competition in the con-
fectionery business.
All this goes close to justifying the
fall of almost 30 percent in the price
of Life Savers shares since their best
levels of last year. But in the last week
or so there has been a modest recovery
to levels between the $2.10 and $2.15
mark that look more realistic and at
which investors are getting fair value
for their money with the prospect of
reasonable capital gain sooner or later.
For the series of setbacks the com-
pany has suffered are not as serious as
they look, as will probably be shown
in next month’s interim report for the
six months to January 31.
For example, the profit trend may
not really be as dismal as the market
seems to have implied from the chair-
man’s statement late last year that the
company’s profit for the first quarter
of 1967-68 was down, so continuing
the previous year’s fall (when the net
dropped 5-|- percent). But the first half
of last financial year was a record, so
this news did not necessarily imply any
fall in the annual rate and in fact profits
for the latest period were only “marg-
inally” below budget, despite in-
creased sales, with higher cocoa prices
getting the blame. Directors expect a
“satisfactory” result for 1967-68, which
at this stage looks as if it could well
be in line with last year’s.
Anyway, their budget for the full
year is believed to be for a profit above
last year’s, even though they anti-
cipated a fall in the first quarter. And
the company is confident enough about
its future to be spending considerable
sums on expanding its capacity.
Nevertheless, the real problems of
rising costs and reduced margins re-
main, although higher sales volumes
appear to be going a long way toward
offsetting their impact on profits, even
if last year’s record sales could not
prevent the 5J percent profit dip.
Labor costs continue to mount; margins
and award wage adjustments last year
raised the average wage level by $3 to
$3.50 a week (and a total of $90,000
a year). Like others in the industry,
the company’s problems with labor are
not only related to its cost; the large
number of female operatives (about
two-thirds) not only means an inevit-
ably high turnover but also prevents
the company working more than one
shift in most sections. The location of
the plant at Lane Cove, well away
from high-density labor sources, inten-
sifies the general problem of labor
shortage.
A 15 percent rise in the domestic
sugar price in June, 1967, accompanied
by an increase in glucose prices, hardly
affected 1966-67 profits, but will have
an adverse effect in 1967-68. So far
there has been little adjustment to
prices of Life Savers products (al-
though sizes of chocolate bars have
been reduced because of high cocoa
prices), but more increases seem in-
evitable. The candy-mint-with-the-hole
which is the basis of the Life Savers
business retailed at 4d for 13 years up
to late 1965, when it was increased to
sd, and this converted down to 4c
with decimalisation in February, 1966.
If anything, the price pressure has
been toward reductions, coming from
the supermarkets and the chainstores,
which are demanding bigger volume
discounts and cutting retail prices for
many products, particularly following
the abandonment of retail price main-
tenance amongst major Australian
manufacturers in mid-1966. This re-
sulted in a 12 percent rise in chocolate
confectionery production in 1966-67
over two years previously, and a five
percent rise in other confectionery.
But these higher sales are not bring-
ing commensurate rewards to pro-
ducers; last year’s record Life Savers
sales were accompanied by a 24 per-
cent increase in stocks and 16 per-
cent increase in debtors, both fairly
significant increases in the light of the
smaller profits.
Two-thirds of Life Savers’ finished
product business is in sugar confec-
tionery, but the one-third in chocolates
is enough to make the company very
sensitive to movements in the price of
cocoa —and there have been violent
moves in recent times, with prices
swinging from $2OO a ton at one stage
in 1965 to $662 in 1967.
Despite these cocoa problems, Life
Savers’ move into chocolates (it
acquired Mastercraft in 1960 and
Smalls in 1962) has paid off; in keep-
ing with world trends, chocolate con-
sumption is rising faster here (up 37
percent in the past five years) than
“other” confectionery (up only 14 per-
cent). This is why it wanted to get
Hoadleys—and why stolid James Sted-
man needed to do so, even at the high
price it eventually had to pay.
Life Savers is confident about its
future. It is expanding its production
facilities at Lane Cove, where all manu-
facturing is carried out with the excep-
tion of raw chocolate (sold to biscuit
and cake manufacturers), which is done
at Stanmore in N.S.W. and Richmond
in Victoria.
The sum of $220,000 was spent on
new plant and equipment in 1966-67
(much of it of “revolutionary” design),
which would have entitled the company
to significant investment allowances,
yet it still showed tax up around the
40 percent mark. Judging by commit-
ments at balance date ($258,000 in 1967
compared with $124,000 in 1966, and a
peak $806,000 in 1964 preparatory to
transfer of Mastercraft operations to
Lane Cove), capital requirements will
be somewhat greater in 1967-68 than
last year. Benefits of all this expendi-
ture should be considerable.
Management has a progressive out-
look, and the emphasis on quality com-
bined with modest prices gives the
company a fair degree of immunity to
economic recessions.
Frequent bonuses in the postwar
years (including a one-for-two in
December, 1962), sometimes accom-
panied by a cash issue (a one-for-two
bonus and three-for-ten at par in Jan-
uary, 1961, a one-for-two bonus in
December, 1962, a one-for-ten bonus
and a one-for-ten cash issue at 300 per-
cent premium in January, 1965), led
investors to class Life Savers as an
excellent growth stock.
More growth is likely, although the
current ratio at 1967 balance date was
healthier than usual, and no cash issue
seems imminent. The 200 percent
cover of reserves for the issued capital,
and absence of long-term liabilities, plus
a continuing high rate of earnings
surely does not mean the end of the
handout for Life Savers shareholders.
As dividend rate is already high at
16 percent, future benefits are likely to
be by way of bonuses giving an effec-
tive but not obvious lift in income for
shareholders.
The shares look sound for medium-
term appreciation, though so long as
there is a threat of a newcomer to the
scene in Mars or any oth°r foreign
company the market will commue cau-
tious. The possibility that Life Savers
itself could attract takeover attention
should not be ruled out.

Security analysis
Kolotex holdings: plenty of
room for growth in stockings
THE AVERAGE AUSTRALIAN
WOMAN over the age of 15 years
bought about 9.2 pairs of full-length
stockings in 1960, less than one pair
a month.
In 1967, Australian women over the
age of 15 were said to have bought,
on average, 13.7 pairs of full-length
hosiery.
In the four months July-October,
1967, Commonwealth Statistician figures
show an output increase in full-length
women’s hosiery of 16.8 percent over
the comparable four months of 1966.
And yet, despite increased purchases of
this sizable order, we are told that
Australian women still buy considerably
fewer stockings than women in Britain,
Europe, and the U.S. In West Germany,
the women buying population (over
15 years) are said to purchase 24.3
pairs of stockings a year, in Britain
21.2 pairs, and in the U.S. 21.1 pairs
a year.
Kolotex Holdings Ltd., which claims
a 20 percent share of the Australian
hosiery market, is the single largest
company in the industry, although the
combined sales of the separate Prestige
and Holeproof hosiery divisions of
Prestige Ltd. would command a greater
aggregated sales volume.
Mr. Paul Kornmehl, a third-
generation member of a Dutch hosiery-
mill family, and Mr. J. A. Louwers,
also from the Dutch yarn trade, started.
Kolotex in 1953 to import hosiery from
the Kornmehl family hosiery mill in
Holland, and from Germany. In 1963
they acquired the near-bankrupt Ross-
lyn Hosiery Ltd., together with its tax
losses and the fact of its being listed
as a private company on the Sydney
Stock Exchange. Rosslyn had not
earned a profit for three years or paid
a dividend for four, but within 18
months under its new management it
had become an asset to Kolotex.
Over the four years 1963-1967, sales
have increased by a cumulative 108.9
percent, total assets by 76.5 percent,
and pre-tax profits by 141 percent. In
1964, George C. Clarke Ltd., an ailing
Sydney company, was acquired for its
tax losses. A combination of past tax
losses and high depreciation allowances
(including investment allowances) has
allowed Kolotex to pay only nominal
company tax rates —the tax to pre-
tax profit margin has not exceeded 11
percent since Kolotex’s acquisition of
the old Rosslyn group.
At one stage, Kolotex operated two
factories, one in Sydney and one in
Melbourne. However, the Melbourne
factory was sold in 1965 and all pro-
duction has been concentrated in the
Leichhardt (Sydney) factory since
August, 1965.
The Sydney factory is of 61,000 sq.
ft. fitted out with 473 automatic knit-
ting machines. Approximately $1.6 mil-
lion has been spent on new plant pur-
chases in the four years 1963-1967. The
company, which produces hosiery 24
hours a day, six days a week, operates
the largest hosiery mill in Australia.
An extensive increase in plant capacity
is planned for 1968, which, with the
cost of buildings, will involve an
expenditure of about $BOO,OOO, bring-
ing even more tax concessions. Kolotex
has its own sales offices in all Austra-
lian capital cities, and total employ-
ment is in the vicinity of 375 (excluding
employment in the recently acquired
Camel group).
Kolotex pioneered both the non-run
and stretch hosiery market in Australia.
If we go back three or so years ago,
about 95 percent of the stockings sold
in Australia were made of conventional
flat yarn composition and only 5 per-
cent was in stretch, mainly for school-
girl wear. Stretch now accounts for
about 33 percent of the total full-length
hosiery market and is produced in sheer
(about 10 percent), non-run (about 12
percent), mesh and panty hose (about
11 percent). Popularity of stretch
hosiery is due to its ability to give a
wrinkle-free fit. Kolotex, which has
been in the vanguard of this movement,
now has only one line outside the
stretch-hosiery field.
In other full-length hosiery, mesh
non-stretch has about 32 percent of the
market, non-run (excluding stretch non-
run) about 14 percent, and sheer, that
is plain, about 21 percent.
Kolotex has now introduced a new
line, which is also proving very suc-
cessful. After test-marketing the
German-invented “stay-up” hosiery for
about two years before commencing
production in the Sydney factory in
1967, the company has again scooped
the pool in this product line.
In market strategy, Kolotex does not
seek to expand its 20 percent share of
the hosiery market, although it spends
an estimated 40 percent of the total
advertising allocated by the industry
each year. The strategy has made
women more Kolotex-brand conscious,
and the campaign has been so successful
that there is a delivery delay of up to
two months in supplying retailers with
many lines. In the past three years
Kolotex has not promoted any un-
branded line to retailers, although it
still does make some “store” brands
which are sold by retailers under their
own names.
Although women are becoming much
more brand-conscious than ever before,
the great majority of stockings produced
in Australia are still sold as un-
branded lines. A well-documented sur-
vey by Fibremakers has suggested that
46 percent of hosiery sales were
sold at up to 59c, 18 percent at 60-79 c,
16 percent in the 80-99 c bracket, and
20 percent in the over $1 range. Kolo-
tex branded lines all sell at 99c and
over.
The new Kolotex subsidiary Camel
Handbag Industries is the second
largest producer of handbags; in Aus-
tralia, and markets its products in
plastic, leather, and metal mesh. This
company commenced operations in a
factory at St. Peters (Sydney) in 1958,
and now employs about 200 operatives,,
and has a further 80 workers not on its
own direct payroll. Camel was acquired
as a diversification, but there is con-
siderable logic in the new grouping, for
the merchandising managers in the re-
tail stores handling hosiery are also
responsible for handbags. With the
Kolotex marketing experience behind
them, the Camel group is finding new
and bigger sales volumes since its acqui-
sition in 1967. Camel represents about
25 percent of the combined Kolotex
group turnover.

Earnings per share have increased
by 160 percent over the four years 1963-
1967. One main reason accounting for
growth in profit has been the company’s
ability to reduce the percentage cost of
wages and salaries to turnover, which
has fallen from the level of 27.5 per-
cent of turnover in 1964 to 22.9 per-
cent in 1967. The way to lower labor
costs per unit of turnover is semi-
automation in the hosiery mill, and the
use of sophisticated hosiery finishing
equipment really pays off.
At the current price of $1.65, the 50-
cent shares have a dividend yield of
5.4 percent and are selling for the
equivalent of 5.4 years’ earnings. This
suggests a fair market discount for a
company still paying only nominal tax
rates, but Kolotex impresses me as a
textile stock with something really out-
standing to offer, and women investors
particularly should find the company
an attractive share investment.

That a flanged wheel turns easily on a steel rail is a simple
fact of immense importance to Australia. Were it not for
the constant turning of such a wheel in this country of
vast distances, transport costs inevitably would be much
higher. Historically, on the turning of that wheel the
whole structure of the nation’s transport charges have
come to be based.
Whether it’s passengers or freight, nothing moves traffic
over land as quickly, efficiently or economically as rail-
ways. Only a train can haul 1,000 tons of freight at a single
lift and at high, sustained speeds over vast distances,
with minimum of manpower, fuel, effort. Ton-mile for
ton-mile, trains take the high cost out of transport.
Another thing. Australia’s railways are government-
owned, are not operated essentially for profit but to pro-
vide necessary freight and passenger services for Aus-
tralia’s people. Support for the Railways of Australia is
support for a century old, century tried and tested policy
of common-sense transport costs from which all Aus-
tralians benefit.

Are Your Investments Safe?
Probably you have been making good capital gains over the last year.
You certainly should have.
But can you preserve them? Will they slip away?
Making Capital Gains:
Anybody who saw which way the wind was blowing, and
made even a modest attempt to set his sails for it, should have
been making money in his portfolio on paper over the
last twelve months. Of course some will have done much better
than others. For the best results it has been necessary to detect
the trends early enough, to have the courage to act on them,
and to be prepared to ruthlessly liquidate holdings which were
lagging, or falling.
Those who have done best will be investors prepared to
recognise that most industrial stocks have been declining rather
than rising. They will have seen that the prestige of a stock
has nothing to do with its market behaviour. They will have
switched from the weaklings to the strength. That is what
Trendex portfolio clients have done.
The Few Strong Industrial Stocks:
Among industrial stocks, those with the best performance
have been “special situations”. Oil and gas rescued B.H.P. from
being a sluggish performer, and the refuge of timorous inves-
tors, to a growth stock of the first magnitude. Some of those
who have prospered with B.H.P. in the last year or more bought
it because of the wonderful new profit opportunities which
became evident, and because market action analysis showed
that a strong price rise was coming. Many others, though, have
just been lucky; they have gained with B.H.P. simply because
they happened to have held it. They would still be holding
B. if it had declined to half its 1966 price. They will still
hold it when it does eventually topple.
Thiess, Lysaght, McDonald Industries, L. J. Hooker and the
Banks are other industrial stocks which have made outstanding
gains. Some holders will be people who have switched into them
after liquidating weaklings. The weaklings may have been
prestige stocks such as A.P.M., Blue Metal, Minster, Coles,
Hanimex, James Hardie, W. R. Carpenter, John Mcllwraith,
Marrickville, National Consolidated, Petersville, Rothmans, or
Waltons. The name does not matter. It is performance which
counts. Coles, Rothmans and Carpenter may come again, even-
tually. It may then be time to buy again, in place of one of
today’s front runners which has, in turn, become tired. That
is the Trendex approach.
Natural Resources Stocks:
Western Mining Corporation, North Broken Hill, Peko,
C. and Kathleen Investments are examples of mining
stocks which even some of the less alert portfolios probably are
holding. Indeed it has been easy to mqke money in almost any
mining stock which one happens to have held, over the last six
or twelve months. Many who have made money in the mining
market have done so for just that reason they “happened”
to have held the stock.
The Australian mining boom has many of the characteristics
of the Canadian mining boom of 15 to 20 years ago. No doubt
the outcome Will be the same. The stocks of many good com-
panies will remain at a high price level, or continue on a
generally rising trend. Others with less substance, or whose
share price has been pushed by market hysteria beyond a
reasonable relationship to company performance, will fall
heavily. Even the best stocks, moreover, will be subject to
substantial price correction from time to time.
Protecting a Position:
The best portfolio results depend, then, only partly on choos-
ing investments with outstanding market gain potential, backed
by solid company performance. The really important thing is
to ensure that the “paper gains” do not melt away when the
market price of one’s- holdings begins to tumble.
Therefore it is essential to distinguish between the minor
setback and the early stage of a major decline sufficiently early
to switch holdings without important loss. This can be done
by using Trendex principles. Many Trendex subscribers who
have put sufficient thought and effort into mastering the prin-
ciples are now applying them. Clients whose portfolios are
managed by Trendex and Co have the job done for them
professionally.
The Complete Answer:
Choosing stocks for market gain has not been a difficult
business over the last six months or so. Others besides Trendex
can claim to have made recommendations or selections which
have achieved good price gains recently. The difference is that
Trendex has been doing it for years, and will continue to do it
after the first big reversal in the present mining boom leaves
many licking their wounds.
It is just not good enough to select stocks to make market
gains. It is essential to sell them before the gains are wiped out.
The properly conducted portfolio relinquishes an investment
which is going sour, so that capital may be protected by being
switched into another growth situation.
Trendex publishes comments on hundreds of stocks. Buying
situations are pointed out. For the past five years, every buying
recommendation in Trendex has been followed through, week
after week, in the Action Table. No buying recommendation is
ever made in Trendex without being followed through. Even-
tual selling recommendations are made when appropriate. It is
one thing to select a stock for investment, and later claim that
it has risen in price. It is another thing, altogether, to point
out when to sell it (rather than to conveniently forget it> once
the long decline has started). Trendex is the only publication
with a record of completing the job.
Trendex Portfolio Management:
The Trendex principles are used for the timing of both
purchases and sales of stocks in portfolios managed by Trendex
& Co Pty Ltd. That is why Trendex portfolio clients get the best
of both worlds buying the right stocks at the right time, and
selling them, too, at the right time.
For that disturbing ailment you seek the best medical advice

self? Get the best professional management obtainable from

Mining
Looking for centralisation
along the sandy beaches
STRETCHING FROM KINCUM-
BER, just north of Sydney, to near
Rockhampton, on the Queensland coast,
the leases of the beach sand-mining
companies overlap one another like so
many dotted lines. There is no other
.section of the Australian mining in-
dustry where the mineral deposits of
each company are so widely spread
over such large distances, and where
■operations are so fragmented. For ex-
ample, the largest rutile and zircon
miner in Australia (and also in the
world), Associated Minerals Consoli-
dated, 'has leases spread out along the
east coast from South Stradbroke
Island, north of Southport, to Wyong,
just north of Sydney. It operates twelve
plants on several of these leases, and
then transports wet mineral concen-
trates by trucks to treatment plants at
Southport, Byron Bay, Port Macquarie,
Diamond Head, Hexham, and Wyong,
and is shortly to commence operating a
plant on South Stradbroke Island. Min-
eral Deposits, the latest entry to the
publicly listed rutile miners, mines
.sand deposits at areas close to Port
Stephens and also near Kempsey, and
operates treatment plants at both of
these mining localities. Cudgen R.Z.
■operates four mining plants, at Bruns-
wick Heads, Byron Bay, and Coff’s
Harbor which supply concentrates to
a central treatment plant at Kings-
cliff.
All these companies face two inevit-
able costs: as areas close to treatment
plants are worked out they must re-
move their wet mining and concen-
trating plants to other areas rather
than continue on through adjacent
ground which in many cases is owned
by other companies; and because
treatment plants are situated close to
existing mining operations, the cost of
transporting wet concentrates from the
mining site to dry treatment plants
must increase as time goes on, until
in some cases it becomes more worth-
while to build a new treatment plant
closer to the sites.
There are several consequences
which these things give rise to; per-
haps the major one is that due to the
rehabilitation work which the miners
are required to carry out on mined
areas and the costs of removing a
mining plant (consisting usually of a
fairly simple combination of a cutter-
suction dredge and a floating wet con-
centration plant) it is uneconomic to
return to areas previously worked.
Thus each area is exploited as fully as
possible at one time, within the con-
fines of cost, grade, and prices, etc. The
winning of long-term contracts for the
supply of mineral at specified prices
is therefore more important for this
industry than for other mining ven-
tures. At the same time the fact that
the deposits can be worked simultan-
eously means that production from the
one area can be expanded quite readily
by the addition of relatively cheap
plant. Major expansion of capacity can,
however, involve the siting of a new
treatment plant closer to the mining
site.
For all these reasons the industry is
one which lends itself to rationalisation,
and has followed such a policy for
some years. The formation of Associ-
ated Minerals was an excellent example
of this, and that company continued
this policy with the acquisition of
Wyong Minerals in April last year.
Associated had been acting as market-
ing agent for Wyong for some time,
and both companies were controlled
by Consolidated Goldfields. The
actual takeover may have been
prompted by the need for Wyong
Minerals to install a dredging plant
on its Tuggerah Lakes areas fairly
quickly in order to forestall conserva-
tionist pressures, and Associated’s plant
at Hexham would be able to provide
the extra treatment capacity which
Wyong’s additional output would then
require.
Rutile and Zircon Mines (Newcastle)
Ltd., the very successful company
jointly owned by Kathleen Investments
and Peko-Wallsend, was the result of
another amalgamation which linked
leases at Belmont, south of Newcastle,
formerly owned by Coff’s Harbor Rutile
and National Minerals N.L. These leases
worked out late last year, and
during the company’s current year it
is transferring its mining plant from
Belmont to Harrington. The treatment
plant at Hexham will continue to be
used to process the concentrates mined
at the new mining site, and recently the
company arranged with the New South
Wales Rutile Mining Company Pty.
Ltd., a subsidiary of Murphyores Inc.
Pty. Ltd., for the combined exploitation
of leases held by both companies in
suitable areas.
No doubt this type of co-operation
between companies with adjoining
leases will continue as far as practic-
able, with transport costs and mobility
of operations as deciding factors, especi-
ally when one or another company is
faced with the alternative of setting up
a new treatment plant. But the industry
has settled down now to a fairly hard
core of companies, many of which have
contractual commitments and close
associations anyway (such as Cudgen
R.Z. and Consolidated Rutile, in which
Cudgen own a 17.7 percent interest),
and it is hard to see where investors can
profit from likely future rationalisation
in the indsutry.
The alternative is perhaps to look
at those rutile miners which will not
have to periodically shift their base of
operations or their mining plants from
area to area, and which will conse-
quently avoid the teething troubles
which will occur when new mining or
treatment plants are commissioned.
The choice here is rather limited: there
is, in fact, only one listed rutile mining
company which has its reserves all to-
gether Rutile Limited.
Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd.’s
subsidiary, Titanium and Zirconium
Industries Pty. Ltd., is also in this
position, but CRA’s shares are hardly
attractive as a stake in the rutile
industry. Another miner which has
one large deposit, as opposed to several
smaller ones, is Queensland Mines Pty.
Ltd., but it is unlikely that this com-
pany’s shares will become available at
all as they are presently owned by
National Lead, of the U.S., and
Titanium Metals, also of the U.S.
Recently listed Mineral Deposits is
better off than most as its reserves are
mostly centred in only two areas and it
will be some time before these are
worked out sufficiently to warrant the
construction of a new treatment plant.
Expanded production could, of course,
mean that such a plant is built anyway.
Even with only two treatment plants,
Mineral Deposits still has to face in-
creased transport costs as mining pro-
gresses to areas farther and farther
away from those plants. That leaves
Consolidated Rutile as the only listed
rutile miner with large reserves which
are all contained in the one area —in
the sand dunes on South Stradbroke
Island. The company is at something
of a disadvantage as it has been opera-
ting for only 18 months (initial produc-
tion began in July, 1966) and in that
time it has encountered considerable
difficulty in treating the heavy sands
being mined.
Production has still not yet reached
the rate estimated in the company’s
prospectus of 30,000 tons of rutile and
25,000 tons of zircon per annum, and
considerable ($2 million) capital ex-
penditure has been required over and
above prospectus estimates to rectify
the position.
But the major reason for investment
in rutile miners is the potential flow-
ing from production increases rather
than any trend of metal prices. Con-
solidated Rutile looks like being in a
favored position, as the expansion of
production from its centralised deposit
should be .more profitable than for
other miners of this metal, who will
face higher operating and capital
costs with every major expansion of
output.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Outstanding shares of the week included Ampol, whose new
Sydney head office was packed for the annual meeting; shares
sold on very high volume. Rumors of an oil strike by Phillips
officially denied offshore Papua led to frantic trading in
Oil Search, which touched 90c in one of the highest daily
turnovers ever recorded in Sydney. Talk of a takeover for
Petersville (whose profit declined for the December half, follow-
ing last year’s profit slip) pushed the shares to 51c,


THE LAND
Dairying fares better than wool
Mr. W. J. VINES, managing director
of the International Wool Secretariat,
has on occasion tried to remind the
wool industry that it was “nearly 15
minutes to midnight,” that in the lack
of very positive action woolgrowing
could almost face elimination as a
major industry. Things may not be
quite as desperate as all that. Yet, on
any count, precious little sense of
urgency seemed to seize the Australian
Wool Industry Conference’s delibera-
tions in Canberra last week. The
major suggestions of the Wool Board’s
marketing report are still unresolved,
considerable grounds of dissension
within the industry remain, and further
reports on debatable matters are to be
furnished “in a few months’ time.”
Perhaps it was too much to expect
the problems of two major rural in-
dustries to be clarified in the one week.
At any rate, so far as some of its
difficulties are concerned, dairying
appears to have fared somewhat better
than wool. The Federal Government is
at least well on the way, at last, to
initiate the early steps of dairy indus-
try rationalisation. Further details
should be out this week for the gradual
elimination of marginal producers and
an amount of around $25 million may
be made available for the States to im-
plement this program.
Here again, great delays have allowed
the more moribund sections of a
patently uneconomic industry to survive
too long. For this phasing-out of
marginal dairy farms was the self-
same policy advocated by the report
of a committee of inquiry into the
dairy industry in 1960, and rejected
by the then Government. It has cer-
tainly been agreed policy for some little
while now, but has characteristically
not been given teeth or drive. And it
can hardly be concluded that the
marginal problem will be finished very
quickly. Admirable as is the notion to
buy out properties to be joined for
beef production or for afforestation,
the scheme is a voluntary one and
must of necessity proceed rather slowly.
Also the present yearly rate of aban-
donment or selling of marginal farms
appears to reach only about 6 percent
of all marginal producers.
Dairying does not want for other
difficulties, either, and the industry
could even stand another full inquiry.
It is becoming basic to discover whether
many reasonably profitable farms are
actually situated in the most suitable
areas for forage and food. Considera-
tion must also be given to the small
rate of growth of the domestic market
and to the fact that those much-talked-
about Asian markets for the medium
and long term are likely to be tremen-
dously competitive.
Turning once more to wool, the
opening of the AWIC meeting
ceded by a veritable fusillade of state-
ments by the Japanese and Common
Market textile industries, and by an
interesting release from the Committee
for the Retention and Improvement of
the Free Wool Market. So far as can
be seen, the AWIC paid not the
slightest public attention to these well-
argued manifestos, preferring still to
create an impression that the market-
ing of wool is something wholly within
the ambit and design of growers. This,
just as much as the contentious
statutory authority and supply manage-
ment, is at the core of the discussion.
It certainly cannot be maintained that
the opposition (and positive ideas) of
buyers and brokers are inspired merely
by a narrow self-interest. These sec-
tions of the industry are definitely
worried about the free flow of wool on
to the market, and rightly so.
What is significant, as well, in the
protests of these various interests is
the ground shared between them and
the repeated willingness of buyers and
brokers to get together with growers
in a manner which will not leave
growers in a minority. Particularly im-
portant, it should seem, is the Japanese
emphasis on improving the quality of
wool. There is general acceptance of
the interlotting of small bale lots, bound
up with a fear that these might event-
ually be used as a buffer stock by a
statutory authority. Japan goes straight
to the point: “It wishes to emphasise
the need for intensified and expanded
wool research and promotion. It is vital
that demand for wool products be
stimulated. These matters, in the view
of Japan, merit more attention from
growers and precedence over the pro-
posed changes in the present sales
system.”
Agrisearch
Wool worries and synthetics
ECONOMISTS have gathered at
various places and pronounced vari-
ously since we recounted a few weeks
ago that the long-term future for wool
seemed reasonably secure. This view
had been expressed by Messrs. E. S.
Malikides and E. J. Waring, of the
Commonwealth’s Bureau of Agricul-
tural Economics, after they had com-
pleted a detailed inquiry into invest-
ment and change in the sheep industry
over the past twenty years. Now it
would appear from the remarks of
other authorities that we would be
unwise to clutch too tightly to this
reassuring opinion and snuggle up,
Linus-like, with a soft woollen blanket
and a warm feeling of contentment that
all will be well.
F. H. Gruen, Monash University
Professor of Economics, back in gloomy
despair from overseas, has told a con-
ference of farm management advisers in
Melbourne that a price war was about
to start between the makers of
artificial fibres. Prof. Gruen has spent
seven months in the U.S. and four in
Europe trying to find out what was
going on in the man-made fibre world,
but complained that he found them a
pretty clammy lot. Apparently, the-
know-how of fibre-making is no longer
privy to a few monopolistic manufac-
turers. Tyros are girding themselves
right now to enter this lucrative field
and will offer their fibres at a lower
price than- that which has been set by
the major producers, in order to gain a
toehold in the market. Cheaper
methods of production are also
rumored to be in the offing and the
price of the raw materials is expected
to decline somewhat. These two factors-
alone could lower the cost of artificials
by up to 15 cents a pound. Prof. Gruen
surmises that over the next 15 years the
price of synthetic fibres is likely to fall
by half. He feels that the effect of this
trend on the wool market may not be-
come serious over the next five years,
but things will be dreadfully difficult
for us later. Devaluation of the cur-
rency and/or subsidisation of the wool-
growers are seen as the likely outcome.
Meanwhile, some thousand miles
away at Armidale, N.S.W., that fearless
economist, Dr. B. R. Davidson, Uni-
versity of Sydney, was telling a meeting

convened by the Committee for
Economic Development of Australia
that the prospects were not alarming,
certainly not catastrophic from the
national point of view. Small, less
efficient woolgrowers, he judged, could
have a tough time of it, even might
have to get out of the industry, but the
bigger men will survive comfortably
enough. Financial return on- capital
invested is not the vital issue deter-
mining who stays on in an industry,
but net income. If this is large enough
to allow a man to live at the standards
to which he has become accustomed he
is happy to continue with whatever
he is doing. The dairy industry, Dr.
Davidson says, provides ample evidence
that farmers are loath to leave the land,
even in the most depressed dairying
districts.
By steadily increasing his efficiency
as he has been, the woolgrower will be
able to continue to meet moderate
declines in prices and moderate rises
in costs, Dr. Davidson believes. Only
very drastic changes in the price and
quality of man-made fibres would un-
settle him. And Dr. Davidson is not
nearly as sure as Prof. Gruen that
changes of this order are coming. The
non-economist might guess that the
new fibremakers envisaged by Prof.
Gruen will not materialise, or if they
do then they will not engage in a
suicidal price war. Moreover, the
human population of the world is in-
creasing very much faster than the
sheep.
Besides, there is no evidence that
the quality of artificial fibres will im-
prove to the point where they can
genuinely replicate wool and be fully
substitutable for it. There is no reason
to believe that any advance in man-
made fibre technology will not be
matched by improvements in wool
processing. Ever since the introduc-
tion of man-made fibres the per capita
consumption of wool has held steady
at about one pound a year. With the
arrival of the artificials, people simply
increased the size of their wardrobes
and bought fewer cotton clothes.
But Mr. A. Lloyd, an agricultural
economist at Melbourne University, has
voiced the most constructive advice.
His studies have shown that in the
better-favored districts sheep farmers
should get into beef regardless of what
happens to wool in the future. Over
the past 20 years, he claims, the price
of beef has almost doubled relative to
wool, and Prof. Gruen is confident that
the market for beef will be buoyant for
many years. Mr. Lloyd points out that
over a wide range of conditions a com-
bination of cattle and sheep is more
profitable than either alone. But
because sufficient agricultural research
of the right kind has not been done in
this country it is impossible to define
the optimum proportions.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
The warrior approach to life
By SANDRA HALL
IN THESE DAYS of specialisation,
the Classical Greeks, with their twin
ideals of physical and cultural excel-
lence, seem separated from us by some-
thing more than a few thousand years.
Hence, one just doesn’t expect to
find a former amateur heavyweight
wrestling champion of Australia in a
Darlinghurst art gallery. But Jeffrey
Makin, a genial, bearded giant of 24,
who weighs more than 14 stone and is
training for the Olympic selection trials,
is also having an exhibition of his
paintings at the Watters Gallery.
Most are made up of strikingly juxta-
posed blocks of color inspired by a set
of widely ranging themes, one of which
is The Warrior. “I like the warrior
Makin . . . amateur wrestler
approach to life. I guess it originated
with this wrestling thing. It gives you
a lot of confidence —especially when
you win. It gives you strength and
something positive.
“I don’t say all painters should be
like this some of the most brilliant
ones are dissipated wrecks. But you
have a filing cabinet full of experiences.
You forget where half of them come
from, but wrestling, I think, adds to
my experience.”
But painting came first. He has
wanted to draw since childhood, when
he travelled through N.S.W. and South-
West Queensland with his father, who
is now a publican in Wollongong.
He went to the National Art School,
worked in the hotel his father owned
at Kings Cross, and “to balance things”
took up wrestling. “I suppose it was the
old Greek thing fitness of body and
mind.
“I used to get heckled at first when
the others found out I was an art stu-
dent, but that hasn’t happened for
three or four years now. I’ve been
training for four and a half years, and
although I won the 1966-67 title I
haven’t actually represented Australia
in any competitions.
“I had to give up wrestling in my
final year at art school, or I wouldn’t
have passed. So I didn’t contest the
title when it came up again. But for
Makin . . . professional artist
the past two months I’ve done nothing
but train—l haven’t even painted.
“The trials for the Mexican Olympics
are at the end of March, but even if I
win I won’t know immediately if I’m
going or not —because they’re not send-
ing all weight divisions. I’d never accept
money for it you only do it because
you love the sport. I like the com-
petitive thing there’s nothing sad-
istic in it just the basic feeling that
man is a free animal and can do what-
ever he wants.”
Makin held a two-man show last
year, “went in for all the competitions
and won the Rockdale.” He painted
traditionally at first, but his style has
gradually come to concern itself prim-
arily with the balance of color.
“It’s a fairly elementary thing, but
a lot of painters don’t worry about it.”
He is influenced by literature, especi-
ally Greek mythology, and sometimes
by social themes. “See these paintings.
I call them ‘Mannekins,’ meaning those
plaster models in shop windows. They’re
suggested by this trend that girls look
like boys and vice versa. I call it the
genderless sex ... I don’t deplore it, I
just find it intriguing. But I’m only
touched off by a theme like this. Once
I start painting, the shapes take over,
and I use them for their own sake.”
He is satisfied with none of the paint-
ings in the exhibition (“there are just
bits I like in all of them”) and, sure,
he could go on working over the same
painting for years. “I have to stop my-
self or I’d do no new work.
“As it is, it’s a continuing process
of change. My idols at the moment are
Paul Klee and de Stael, and I think
you should keep yourself in this embyro
stage for as long as possible taking
what you want but making sure you
borrow from the best. There’s still a
lot of indecision in my work there
has been since I started breaking away
from the traditional style, because there
are no factual references.
“For a while I used wax and pig-
ments, but I just didn’t dig it, so I
painted over the top in lacquer, then in
oils. Another thing, I think painters
have to be willing to be hurt. There
seem to be a lot of insensitive people
around.”
Perth Festival, Theatre
Shakespeare's show
By DUNCAN GRAHAM
IN 1964 THE ELIZABETHAN
replica New Fortune Theatre was built
at the W.A. University. Thousands
praised its possibilities but few explored
them till this festival when a magni-
ficent, adventurous production of
Richard 111 was staged in a way that
would have delighted the Bard and
satisfied the most ardent Elizabethan
purist.
The producer, University of N.S.W.
drama lecturer Philip Parsons, one of
the New Fortune’s original designers
and a critic of its past use, forgot that
any other type of theatre had ever
existed and set out to make the play
fit the stage and entertain the audi-
ence. He threw a handful of players,
some acting up to eight parts as they
did in the Elizabethan era, around the
huge square stage with a pace and


sophistication that could not have been
improved on film.
Martin Redpath as Richard grew
visibly more flamboyantly evil with
every line. The cast romped about
the stage as though it were the whole
world. The rich clear language cas-
caded, without impediment, over the
people seated in the pit and the gaily
decked galleries on all four sides of the
open stage.
Once the audience had adjusted to
the fluid impactful production, the re-
jection of lighting gimmicks and other
conventional theatre trappings, and the
absence of stage auditorium barriers,
both physical and psychological, the
actors and audience became emotionally
one. The play lived, Shakespeare
breathed. It was a startling, unique ex-
perience. The blend of production,
cast, audience, theatre, and play were
near faultless. Richard 111 alone has
made the Festival worth while and
would justify any expense, any trip.
After such a play, other events are
usually insignificant, and I would rank
the well-acted St. Martins’ Theatre Co.
presentation of Thomas Keneally’s
“Halloran’s Little Boat” in this
category. The play, staged at the Perth
Playhouse, was competent, interesting,
clever but sterile. “Halloran’s Little
Boat” explored too many blind alleys.
It lacked a strong central theme to link
the scenes together and so lost
emotional continuity with the audience.
However, the Festival’s first week
became more than memorable with the
addition of a late-night revue presented
by a young unknown South African
couple, Frank Lazarus and Maggie
Soboil.
The program, a highly individualistic
collection of song-words-mime-sketches
avoided all the standard cliches ex-
pected in this sort of entertainment.
Their humor was universal, their talents
rich, and their material, particularly a
comedy spoof called “Hello, Macbeth!”,
was clever without being superior or
base. They are also a personable couple,
and with this combination it is difficult
to see how they can go wrong in the
Eastern States, where they hope to
head.
Films
Cameraman's film
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
A Man And A Woman. Director,
Claude Lelouch.
Rosie. Director, David Lowell Rich.
CLAUDE LELOUCH’S “A Man And
A Woman” is the first film directed by
this cameraman, and is more interesting
as a debut in movie-making than as a
screen work on its own merits. There’s
something engaging about Lelouch’s
delight in having a camera to play
about with without interruptions from
a silly old director who’s stodgily con-
cerned with what the film is about;
and indeed the movie is always visually
interesting, though, after a time,
Lelouch’s shifts of focus, his alter-
nations between clear color, misty color,
and sepia, become selfconscious and
even predictable.
But Lelouch, determined to involve
himself completely with his film, has
both directed and worked on the script,
and a remarkably tripy, novelettish
script it is. It is the simple story of a
young couple, both tragically widowed,
who meet, are attracted, and finally—
after a rather inexplicable fit of the
sulks from the young woman admit
that they love each other. A no more
complicated story was the basis in
“Dear John” of a tender and deeply
understanding film, but this one never
rises above the level of a cheap, wish-
fulfilling love story.
Lelouch wastes a good deal of
time establishing the fact that the
couple are both engaged in “glamorous”
jobs he a racing driver, she a film
technician and one can’t help feel-
ing that the director wouldn’t have
been at all interested in the love story
of, let’s say, a bank teller and a comp-
tometer operator, though the emotions
involved could well be deeper and more
sincere.
Technical expertise is only the basic
requirement for a film director, and
Lelouch has a lot to learn before he
becomes more than an enthusiastic
amateur. In the meantime the film is
well worth looking at literally that
but a pair of earplugs might be a
good idea to protect you from the ex-
treme flatness of the dialogue and from
a long, deafening motor-racing sequence
which makes “Grand Prix” seem, in
retrospect, almost like a silent movie.
In the ’thirties, no doubt because of
the spectacle of the Depression before
them, American scriptwriters conceived
the notion that there was something
innately sinful about having money,
and a lot of plays and films like “You
Can’t Take It With You” were writ-
ten to prove that eccentric, imaginative
poor people were far happier and bet-
ter than the dreary old rich. After this
it was only a step to argue that rich
people were all right so long as they
were eccentric, too “zany” and
“wacky” were the words used a
theme which found its most famous ex-
pression in “My Man Godfrey.”
Surprisingly, this old chestnut returns
in “Rosie,” a sentimental comedy about
an eccentric millionairess whose nasty
relatives try to have certified unfit to
administer her fortune, but who, of
course, emerges with both millions and
wackiness intact. There’s a curiously
old-fashioned air about the picture, des-
pite its lavish, up-to-the-minute mount-
ing; and it was surely a mistake to cast
Rosalind Russell in the central role.
For all her smart professionalism as a
comedienne, she never succeeds in con-
vincing as an eccentric who honestly
likes fun more than money; Miss Rus-
sell clearly knows precisely the number
of cents in the dollar and the very
best way to invest them.
Television
Manoeuvring
By FRANK ROBERTS
BEFORE the commercial channels*
stand last year against higher prices
for American series, there used to be
an annual New Year scramble to pro-
mote “the new shows.” An attempt to
revive it this year, particularly in
Sydney, fell a little flat; ABC-TV had
quietly (in its old fashion too quietly)
phased in a variety of new shows to-
ward the end of last year, and early
this year had let the commercials
prattle on about series featuring a flying
nun, a fetching young kangaroo, etc.,
before stepping in with its own new
batch of new shows, which it announced
suddenly and loudly.
The ABC’s offensive has the weight
of viewers picked up during the past
year or so (by “Till Death Us Do
Part,” “The Dean Martin Show,” both
renewed, and television treatments of
Evelyn Waugh’s World War II trilogy,
under the title of “Sword of Honor,”
and an Arnold Bennett work featuring
Kenneth More, who now returns in a
long-held “Forsyte Saga”).
It includes returns of “This Day
Tonight” and “Four Corners” and
two promising 8 p.m. series with Sid
James and Alastair Sim and (to me
only) lesser series such as “The Girl
From UNCLE,” which may turn out to
be most popular. In all, a slam-bang
Big Push.
One or two things stand firmly in
the ABC’s path to victory. The first
is the ABC’s 7 p.m. news. By that
time the commercials in Sydney have
ended their news sessions and are into
their own 7 p.m. attractions, such as
“Pick a Box” or “Skippy” or the “Pied
Piper,” “The Flying Nun,” “Batman,”
etc., which naturally have popular-show
follow-ups. This is the front against
which the ABC’s new shows will be
launched.
If the ABC has long-range plans to
make a dent this year, and smash
through later, at the end of this year
or the beginning of next, an imponder-
able inner defence may have been
strengthened by then.
This would seem to be a new pro-
duction style, evident in ATN7’s
“T.H.E. Cat,” and TCN9’s “Ironside.”
It is a matter of cutting from person
to person at almost subliminal speed,
which gives even the almost-static scene
a sense of action and excitement. A
further development of television as
being largely concerned with people’s
faces, it is quite something to watch.
I suspect older viewers will hate it,
younger viewers will like it. If it be-
comes a general U.S. production
style, it would make British television
shows seem painfully slow in develop-
ing their action, whether thoughtful,
as in “Ironside,” or slam-bang, as in
“T.H.E. Cat.”


Art
Sydney's Colder
Tapestry by Vasarely in the public area of the main building of the Australia
Square complex, Sydney
By ELWYN LYNN
IT WOULD BE HARD to exaggerate
the importance for Australian sculpture,
and for the city of Sydney, of Calder’s
38ft.-high Crossed Blades, tough and
taut but graceful, earth-bound but
soaring, menacing but formally com-
plete in itself. So grand is it that
questions of liking it hardly arise; it’s
one of those masterpieces that asks
how much art one really needs in a
lifetime. It does seem rather absurd
to say one doesn’t like the pyramids
or Guernica and, in any case, there is
no moral or aesthetic obligation to
like good art. I’m on this brief tangent
because a lot of people, critics in-
cluded, think their likes and dislikes
very important when they are simply
bits of an egoistic autobiography.
Public-place displays of Calder are
not common: one, 59ft. - high,
straddles a street in Italy’s Spoleto,
two temporarily rose, like the black
sails of Arthur’s barge, in the green
park at Kassel’s Documenta in 1964,
and a Calder mobile stands near a Miro
wall and a Moore at UNESCO; but
it was only last November that two
Calders were shown among 29 others
in New York’s Sculpture in Environ-
ment exhibition, the environment being
street architecture.
Sydney is fortunate in another way,
for the Calder, and the tapestries by
Corbusier and Vasarely, tie up some
persistent threads in European art.
Calder, who will be 70 this July, met
Arp, Miro, and Mondrian in 1926;
in 1930 he met Leger, whom Corb
had met in 1920, and it was Corb’s
purist notions of art as a rational
record of crystalline perfection free
from romanticism and anecdotalism
that profoundly affected the ’twenties,
the German Bauhaus, and the Muhely
Academy, that Budapest Bauhaus at-
tended by Vasarely whose idea of art
as visual purification stems from
theories similar to Corb’s.
Oddly enough, as art became purer
and technically more sophisticated,
Calder became sterner and his tech-
nical means blunt and obvious: his
retrospective at the Guggenheim in
1964-65 of over 300 works traced his
development through cute wire whim-
sies and mobiles of spiralling metal
leaves, and multiple, restless, shifting
planes to his ponderous black struc-
tures with revolving ploughshare and
disc shapes, and to the solid monu-
mentality of works like Crossed Blades
which so retain the sense of varied
mobility that they are aptly called
stabiles.
Critical comment is yet to elucidate
the significance of Calder’s funereally
romantic farm-implement style of sculp-
ture; it is in line with the earthiness
and grim restraint of a Chillida, with
Louise Nevelson’s black cupboards of
mummified furniture and Reinhardt’s
black paintings. Calder wants a formal
independence that permits, without cir-
cumscribing its own activities, symbolic
associations, and it is no accident that
he had called a recent work Guillotine
for Eight, and his 35ft. staccato cas-
cade of mobile, metal, white planes
that he made especially for the Gug-
genheim retrospective, Ghost, an un-
predictable piece that pointed up the
banal functionalism of Wright’s
museum.
Crossed Blades may resemble two
clashing scimitars supported by two
lean flying buttresses, but the blades
can, from other angles, resemble in-
verted supports.; the supports, as they
are flanged down the middle of their
sides, seem to vary in weight and
width. As you move they form a
delicate arch, and, when one seems to
be doing the supporting work alone
there’s a splendid play of mass against
line. It follows purist aesthetics: the
material, the bolting, the triangular
supports at the junctions of the blades
have a blacksmith’s honesty. The im-
pression of enclosing power and sud-
The Calder sculpture, “Crossed
Blades,” against the background-
of Australia Square
den release of abrupt confrontation
and black, lyrical ease arises from the
formal inventiveness the curve of a
blade breaks into the slightest of angles
and the leisurely plateau of the sup-
ports suddenly falls precipitately. The
variation of speeds of the movement
is intricate and intriguing. Though you
may walk between its legs, the real
environmental feature is how it res-
ponds to morning shadows, the blaze of
noon, and long evening shadows.
There is some currency, inflated of
course, to notions of art as environment
and as life, but the Calder routs most
of its immediate environment and, like
a Stonehenge, records the subtle changes
in light as no other sculpture in Aus-
tralia does.
Near the Calder the Corbusier
tapestry (done at Aubusson under the
master-weaver Panton; Tabard super-
vised the Vasarely) repeats Calder’s
bent curves and, despite Corb’s purist
ideology, it combines, as does Calder,
organic forms with architectural struc-
ture. Its flat, uningratiating color em-
phasises the tugging, rare in tapestry,
between left and right, and between
fluid areas and brittle; broken lines.
Done in 1956—its only replica is at
UNESCO—it perpetuates the clear, flat
forms, and colors of the ’twenties which
have recently stirred what Vasarely calls
a “seething army of youngsters.”
The Vasarely, on the opposite curve
of the cylindrical tower, where it catches
some of the levitation of the fountains,
despite its origin in formal and optical
theories, is opulent and luxurious like
his works in enamels, and embodies a


European love of delicious surfaces.
While most optical artists use a repeti-
tious unqualified emphasis, Vasarely
disposes pauses of dark green discs
amid the sharply colored ovals, caught
in flight like flying-saucers, and discs
all placed in squares of varying greys.
It is a gloriously celebratory work
that, like a mathematician’s garden, re-
calls the medieval tapestries devoted to
the enclosed garden as microcosm of
the beauties of the world,
The Vasarely is a fine introduction
to the kinetics and near-kinetics pur-
chased by the Power Institute and to
go on show at Australia Square on Feb-
ruary 26; quite a few of the exhibitors
show at Paris’ Denise Renee Gallery of
which Vasarely was co-founder.
Theatre
Inspiriting
By DENIS O'BRIEN
A Scent of Flowers. James Saunders.
Independent, Sydney.
THIS thoughtful, sensitive tragi-
comedy about the first few hours after
the death of a young suicide is an
attractive addition to the Indepen-
dent’s repertory season, and has just
enough substance among its ethereality
to defeat the soporific effects of the
theatre’s lack of air-conditioning.
Heaven save me from Waiting for
Godot in the Independent on a humid
night! I often think that managements,
Carmen Duncan and Donald Mac-
donald in "A Scent of Flowers.”
Independent, Sydney
who have their players thrash out the
human condition on stage while their
patrons are steaming or shivering in
the stalls, do not really care about
humanity.
Playwriter Saunders is revealed here
as a poetic agent with an articulate,
if passing, concern for the way in
which we bump against each other
in life without really making contact.
Death brings degrees of guilt, but by
then it’s too late for more than re-
morse and self pity. Life bumps on.
The play was first presented in
London in 1964, gliding in and out
of the West End within three months,
but it deserves the careful and effec-
tively lit production Ken Hannam
gives it for the Independent in Sydney.
Hannam has coped very well with
Saunders’ tricky way of telling the
story through a continuous flow of time
changes, slowly moving the action
forward along the preparations for
young Zoe’s funeral while all the time
flashing it back so that she can observe
and participate in some of the bitter
and bitter-sweet “bumps” in her life.
It takes the whole of the first act to
come to terms with this sort of hop-
scotch; early on, it’s not quite clear if
Zoe is dead, alive, resurrected, or ghostly
in the Blithe Spirit manner. After-
wards, the play constructs enough
subtle dividing lines among its solilo-
quies to show just how living was an
agony of callous misunderstandings and
tormented inner conflict for the girl,
and why she is so painfully lonely in
death.
Carmen Duncan gives Zoe much
gentle sympathy. She needs to make her
more delicately poised between this
world and the next, but makes the show
a worthwhile ticket with a touching
performance which recalls memories of
her splendid Marilyn Monroe in “After
the Fall.”
Donald Macdonald increases his
stature with a selfless performance as
Zoe’s selfish half-brother whose almost
incestuous familiarity with the girl
blinds him to her need for under-
standing.
I haven’t seen any of the other pro-
ductions in the Independent’s repertory,
but I could see in this one the beneficial
evidence of a company working together
continuously. Brian James, as Zoe’s
sad clown of an uncle, Jacqueline Kott,
her loveless mother, James Condon,
her ineffectual father, and Ross Thomp-
son and Tony Thurbon as a couple of
significant gravediggers all strike their
lines with ensemble spirit. Even
Alexander Hay, giving another of his
impersonations of an austere cleric,
makes his mono-style blend agreeably
with this production.
I was puzzled by the slides which
producer Hannam has thought neces-
sary to flash on to a screen at the
beginning of the play. They show the
hands and feet of a man on his way to
death by an overdose of sleeping pills,
but Zoe, as played by Miss Duncan, is
all woman.
Frosty reception
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Spring in Port Wine. Bill Naughton.
Comedy, Melbourne.
USUALLY I’ve slipped into the night
before curtain speeches, but never again.
What happened after “Spring in Port
Wine” was infinitely more entertaining
than the play itself. First of all, Alfred
Marks (who you may remember rush-
ing from pillow to bedpost in the BBC’s
Feydeau farces) made a number of
quite successful funnies. Then he intro-
duced the play’s director, Mr. Allan
Davis.
Mr. Davis is an Australian who’s
been working in the Mother Country
for some years, serving as “a Captain in
the Buffs” and directing the London
production of. the play in question. In
a speech considerably more enthusiastic
than the audience’s response to the
comedy, he made what could be con-
sidered a number of faux pas.
First, he spoke of “the healthy state
of Australian theatre,” placing this to
the credit of the “brilliant management
of J.C.W.” These men, he assured
us, had “remarkable vision, bravery,
foresight, and business acumen,” an
accolade which reduced a number of
thespians in the audience around me
to hysterics. Next he went on to thank
the cast effusively. And is there any-
thing more grating than hearing an
emigre talking about “these dear
Aussies” in a Mayfair accent?
To cap things off, he described his
childhood dreams of a J.C.W. career,
when he sat “up there in the cheap two-
bob seats.” The last comment, not
surprisingly, caused an outraged out-
burst from the befurred patrons on
the receiving end of his gesture. Hav-
ing paid many dollars for their first-
night privileges, they made their dis-
pleasure clear, while one ringing con-
tralto gave Mr. Davis a loud piece of
her mind.
As for the play, it is not “great” as
Mr. Davis insists. It is merely pleasant.
A sort of low-keyed “Hobson’s Choice,”
it concerns a family dominated by a
stern trade unionist who is such a
stickler for detail that he refuses scissors
when unwrapping a parcel. “Knots,”
he observes in a stern baritone, “are
made to be untied.”
Tlis puritanism, forged in Hunger
Marches, is creating deep tensions in
the household, and suddenly the fabric
tears. Yet, just when rebellion should
create raging conflict, Dad turns into a
paper tiger, concedes ground,
apologises, and is forgiven.
Based on a TV play by the author
of “Alfie,” “Spring in Port Wine” is
decent, slow-moving, undemanding, and
mystifying. Not mystifying in its con-
tent, for every point is made with
excessive clarity. But mystifying in its
success, for the play has run in London
for over two years. My only explana-
tion is the presence of Alfred Marks,
who is enormously likable.

Quixotic gesture
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Man of La Mancha. Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Sydney.
“MAN OF LA MANCHA” comes here
on the crest of a wave of critical en-
thusiasm, which is always a difficult
spot for a play to be in it’s almost
impossible not to feel a bit let down
after all those paeans of praise. It’s a
tribute to the show that, although it does
disappoint a little, it is still both an
interesting experiment and a generally
satisfactory—though not to me exciting
—theatrical experience.
One can only admire the courage of
playwright Dale Wassermann in
attempting to bring not only Cervantes’
monumental “Don Quixote” but Cer-
vantes himself into the compass of a
two-hour play. He has succeeded re-
markably well, considering that he was
trying to do the impossible, but what
he has done, clever and sometimes mov-
ing as it is, is still rather like carving
the Lord’s Prayer on a rice grain, an
achievement more notable for ingenuity
than artistry.
Wassermann’s script and Joe Darion’s
lyrics do occasionally rise to the re-
quired poetic heights, but in between
times they fall to a lower, more senti-
mental level. At its best the play shows
us Don Quixote as the God-inspired
madman, at its worst it makes him a
lovable, bumbling ninny; the best of
the lyrics have both toughness and
beauty, but some songs —like the one
in which the knight’s grasping relatives
protest hypocritically that “I’m Only
Thinking Of Him”—amusing as they
are—belong in a very different sort of
play.
But there can be no such reser-
vations about the music, or about the
general standard of production and
performance. Mitch Leigh’s score is
always muscular and masculine, even at
its most imaginative and romantic, and
manages to keep: a flavor of Spain with-
out giving us the usual watered-down
mixture of Carmen and castanets. The
brilliant simplicity of Howard Ray’s
New York-designed sets and lighting
have been reproduced here with re-
markable expertise; Marnel Sumner’s
direction and Betty Pounder’s choreog-
raphy discreetly underline the mood
of the play without drawing undue
attention to themselves.
The actors, too, are capably un-
obtrusive, and in the case of Charles
West a good deal more than that he
distinguishes most deftly between his
dual characterisations of Cervantes and
Don Quixote, and invests the knight
with a touching dignity and sincerity.
There is a ring of true dedication in
his singing of “The Impossible Dream,”
and thank goodness he doesn’t find it
necessary, like most of the singers who
are belting out the number on records,
to yell to get its message across.
Suzanne Steele is a fine, lusty
Aldonza, and it’s the fault of the script
rather than the actress that her final
translation into Dulcinea isn’t really
convincing. But she is completely
believable in her presentation of the
song in which she reproaches Don
Quixote for trying to change her —
which, by the way, is just about the
only time the play faces squarely what
was surely one of the strongest themes
in Cervantes’ book—the fact that, for all
the purity and nobility of his vision, the
knight was to ordinary people dangerous
and destructive, presenting them with
an unreal ideal which it was impossible
for them to live up to and confusing
them in their precious adjustment to
reality.
Music
"Prom" rebel
By PAUL FROLICH
THIS YEAR’S first “Prom” concert
was distinguished by Peter Sculthorpe’s
music; interest at the third one centred
on David Ahern’s iconoclastic “Ned
Kelly Music.” But it was the second
concert of the series, ranging from the
14th to our own century, which came
closest to the ideal. Despite steambath
conditions and acoustic vagaries, here
we had a full evening of fine music,
all well performed and wholly interest-
ing.
Surprisingly, it was the lovely
clarinet concerto by Mozart which be-
came the least impressive item on the
menu. This work is not well suited
to Sydney Town Hall’s cavernous effects
and its gentle beauty is that of chamber
music. Donld Westlake, a fine clari-
nettist of sure taste and great sensibility,
is himself essentially a chamber player,
whose tone is rich and sweet rather
than big. On this occasion, slow tempi
and the soloist’s own style were con-
ducive both to lovely sound and to
heat-induced somnolence.
Early music was represented by
Guillaume de Machaut’s Mass, written
about 1364, excellently performed by
the Oriana Singers and the Renaissance
Players, with Norman Johnston as con-
ductor. This music, well' sung and
played by a small ensemble which in-
cluded a krumhorn, lute, small harp,
recorders, and percussion, is of infinitely
varied sonorities and rhythmic intri-
cacies. These qualities, for a full impact,
demand the clear acoustics of a small
church and close proximity with the
performers. In the Town Hall, much
as I was able to enjoy the work, its
true sound was blurred.
There were two modern works, Luto-
slawski’s “Concerto for Orchestra” and
Messiaen’s “Et Expecto Resurrectionem
Mortuorum.” The Polish work, written
in the early days of the cultural thaw,
is a very attractive piece which provides
virtuoso opportunities for almost every
section of the orchestra. The great
event of the evening was the Messiaen
work. It is scored for three ensembles:
winds, brass, and percussion and pro-
duces some glorious and shattering
sonorities. Intended for open-air per-
formance, it includes three sets of tuned
cow-bells and three enormous tam-
tams.
The music has a slightly Eastern
flavor and, with its plaintive Grecian
tone-row, had the same monumental
character as Leonard French’s paint-
ings in the “Seven Days” and “Cam-
pion” series utterly right. The
orchestra, good throughout this con-
cert, rose brilliantly to the challenge
of this difficult and rewarding score.
In the third concert, the orchestra
was again the real hero. They played
exquisitely well in Tadeusz Baird’s
“Four Essays for Orchestra.” This work,
written in 1959, is of a gentle lyricism
and would sound best in a chamber-
sized hall.
David Ahern’s gesture of musical
protest rightly roused the youthful
audience. The 20-year-old composer
has a sufficient grasp of orchestral
technique to get away with what he
attempted: a blend of humor, satire,
and warranted rebellion. Clearly, this
was an event which fairly represented
the feelings of many, not least the
members of the Sydney Symphony
Orchestra, who have to spend so many
weary hours plowing the same old 19th-
century furrows.


ON AN
ENGRAVING
by
CASSERIUS
(For Dr. John Z. Bowers)
By A. D. HOPE
Set on this bubble of dead stone and sand,
Lapped by its frail balloon of lifeless air,
Alone in the inanimate void, they stand,
These clots of thinking molecules who stare
Into the night of nescience and death,
And, whirled about with their terrestrial ball,
Ask of all being its motion and its frame:
This of all human images takes my breath;
Of all the joys in being a man at all,
This folds my spirit in its quickening flame.
Turning the leaves of this majestic book
My thoughts are with those great cosmographers,
Surgeon adventurers who undertook
To probe and chart time’s other universe.
This one engraving holds me with its theme
More than all maps made in that century
Which set true bearings for each cape and star,
De Quiros’ vision or Newton’s cosmic dream,
This reaches toward the central mystery
Of whence our being draws and what we are.
It came from that great school in Padua:
Casserio and Spiegel made this page.
Vesalius, who designed the Fabrica,
There strove, but burned his book at last in rage;
Fallopius by its discipline laid bare
The elements of this humanity,
Without which none knows that which treats the soul;
Fabricius talked with Galileo there:
Did those rare spirits in their colloquy
Divine in their two skills the single goal?
“One force that moves the atom and the star;”
Says Galileo, “one basic law beneath
All change!” “Would light from Achetnar
Reveal how embryon forms within its sheath?”
Fabricius asks, and smiles. Talk such as this,
Ranging the bounds of our whole universe
Could William Harvey once have heard? And once
Hearing, strike out that strange hypothesis,
Which in De Motu Cordis twice recurs,
Coupling the heart’s impulsion with the sun’s?
Did Thomas Browne at Padua, too, in youth
Hear of their talk of universal law
And form that notion of particular truth
Framed to correct a science they foresaw,
That darker science of which he used to speak
In later years and called the Crooked Way
Of Providence? Did he foresee perhaps
An age in which all sense of the unique,
And singular dissolves, like ours today,
In diagrams, statistics, fables, maps?
Not here! The graver’s tool in this design
Aims still to give not general truth alone,
Blueprint of science or data’s formal line:
Here in its singularity he has shown
The image of an individual soul;
Bodied in this one woman, he makes us see
The shadow of his anatomical laws.
An artist’s vision animates the whole,
Shines through the scientist’s detailed scrutiny
And links the person and the abstract cause.


Such were the charts of those who pressed beyond
Vesalius their master, year by year
Tracing each bone, each muscle, every frond
Of nerve until the whole design lay bare.
Thinking of this dissection, I descry
The tiers of faces, their teacher in his place,
The talk at the cadaver carried in:
“A woman—with child!”; I hear the master’s dry
Voice as he lifts a scalpel from its case:
“With each new step in science, we begin.”
Who was she? Though they never knew her name,
Dragged from the river, found in some alley at dawn,
This corpse none cared, or dared perhaps, to claim;
The dead child in her belly still unborn,
Might have passed, momentary as a shooting star,
Quenched like the misery of her personal life,
Had not the foremost surgeon of Italy,
Giulio Casserio of Padua,
Bought her for science, questioned her with his knife,
And drawn for his great Anatomy;
Where still in the abundance of her grace,
She stands among the monuments of time
And with a feminine delicacy displays
His elegant dissection: the sublime
Shaft of her body opens like a flower
Whose petals, folded back expose the womb,
Cord and placenta and the sleeping child,
Like instruments of music in a room
Left when her grieving Orpheus left his tower
Forever, for the desert and the wild.
Naked she waits against a tideless shore,
A sybilline stance, a noble human frame
Such as those old anatomists loved to draw.
She turns her head as though in trouble or shame,
Yet with a dancer’s gesture holds the fruit
Plucked, though not tasted, of the Fatal Tree.
Something of the first Eve is in this pose
And something of the second in the mute
Offering of her child in death to be
Love’s victim and her flesh its mystic rose.
No figure with wings of fire and back-swept hair
Swoops with his: Blessed among Women!; no sword
Of the spirit cleaves or quickens her; yet there
She too was overshadowed by the Word,
Was chosen, and by her humble gift of death
The lowly and the poor in heart give tongue,
Wisdom puts down the mighty from their seat;
The vile rejoice and rising, hear beneath
Scalpel and forceps, tortured into song,
Her body utter their magnificat.
Two hundred years since first that cry rang out:
Two hundred years, the patient, probing knife
Cut toward its answer —yet we stand in doubt:
Living, we cannot tell the source of life.
Old science, old certainties that lit our way
Shrink to poor guesses, dwindle to a myth.
Today’s truths teach us how we were beguiled;
Tomorrow’s how blind our vision of today.
The universals we thought to conjure with
Pass: there remain the mother and the child.
Loadstone, loadstar, alike to each new age,
There at the crux of time they stand and scan,
Past every scrutiny of prophet or sage,
Still unguessed prospects in this venture of Man.
To generations, which we leave behind,
They taught a difficult, selfless skill: to show
The mask beyond the mask beyond the mask;
To ours another vista, where the mind
No longer asks for answers, but to know:
What questions are there which we fail to ask?
Who knows, but to the age to come they speak
Words that our own is still unapt to hear:
“These are the limits of all you sought and seek;
More our yet unborn nature cannot bear.
Learn now that all man’s intellectual quest
Was but the stirrings of a foetal sleep;
The birth you cannot haste and cannot stay
Nears its appointed time; turn now and rest
Till that new nature ripens, till the deep
Dawns with that unimaginable day.”
EASTER, 1967


BOOKS
Why Soviet writers
are jailed
By PATRICK MORGAN
“ALL THESE TRIALS Sinyavsky,
Daniel, Bukovsky, and now these boys
it’s like a necklace, one bead leads
to another,” said a Moscow woman out-
side the courtroom where four young
Russians were sentenced last month.
The line of connection is direct and
continuous. The Pasternak affair of the
late ’fifties caught the world’s attention
and started it all. In the famous photo,
Sinyavsky and Daniel carry Pasternak’s
coffin, and they have carried the not
merely symbolic burden of their identi-
fication with him ever since. When
they were eventually identified as
“Tertz” and “Arzhak” and arrested in
September, ’65, the poet Ginsburg was
one of those who organised the demon-
stration of 200 students in Moscow’s
Pushkin Square on December 5 in
protest against their detention.
The severe sentences imposed on
Sinyavsky and Daniel in February ’66
provoked not only an enormous out-
cry in the West but protests, petitions,
and demonstrations inside Russia itself,
including that of the underground
poetry magazine “Phoenix 66,” pro-
duced by Galanskov and Dobrovolsky.
When these three leading protesters
were in their turn arrested in January
’67, Bukovsky organised a demonstra-
tion against their detention, and was
himself arrested for this.
At his trial last September, he was
given three years hard labor; other
demonstrators got shorter sentences.
Meanwhile Pavel Litvinov leaked to the
West the transcript of the Bukovsky
trial plus a record of his own inter-
rogation by the secret police, the KGB.
This was published last December, a
month before the three writers were
sentenced to seven, five, and two years’
hard labor themselves. This occasioned
the outspoken protest to world opinion
by Litvinov, and Daniel’s wife demand-
ing redress. And there for the moment
the matter, if it doesn’t exactly rest,
at least bubbles.
What this brief chronology does not
show is the many other jailings of
writers and demonstrators (such as
Mihajlo in Yugoslavia), the spate of
protests against all repressions (such as
the revolt of the Czech writers led by
Ludvik Vaculik), the extensive circula-
tion of underground manuscripts: for
the first time, East European intellec-
tuals are becoming habituated to the
techniques of protest and complaint.
However, what the chronology does
show is that those whose names have
been cropping up in individual protests
on diverse fronts in the past decade and
who previously had only attitudes in
common, now have a common issue as
well. By its handling of the Sinyavsky-
Daniel case, the regime has succeeded
in uniting the opposition to it on a
single and continuing theme.
The one thing that makes a tyranny
worried is when an embryonic opposi-
tion develops a self-generating momen-
tum, when jailing one man produces
twelve of his like, when attempts at
prevention produce proliferation. The
Russian phenomenon has this cumula-
tive quality about it. The writers are
utterly fearless, almost reckless, in the
way that repression only emboldens
them to escalate to further, more radical
demands.
The poet Ginsburg: just released
from a couple of terms in the uranium
mines, he sends off a letter of protest
to Kosygin telling off the State and
president over Sinyavsky and Daniel,
organises demonstrations, collects a
White Book on their trial and sends it
off to President Podgorny, and even at
his own trial he bitterly attacks the past
and present methods of the KGB. One
is tempted to say that he is quite irre-
pressible, but, sadly, he has now been
repressed.
The scientist Litvinov: he sends
abroad the Bukovsky transcript and the
KGB interrogation. In the teeth of
unequivocal threats from the KGB, he
appeals for the release of the four
writers, is barred from the courtroom
during the trial, calls the proceedings
a “wild mockery,” is dismissed from
his job, and says he will appeal over it.
It is difficult for us to imagine the
courage of such actions in a country
where the dissenter risks, not a token
sentence, but years spent in a region
where polar bears flourish but human
beings do not. The authorities know
that these men are impervious to
the customary pressures, sanctions, and
threats, and senses the revolutionary
implications of the situation, so it is
now charging them with “anti-Soviet
activities.” It is unnecessary to deal
with this charge in the absurd way that
it is canvassed in court, where a gro-
tesque literary-political debate is
enacted in which the loser gets hard
labor and the loser is predeter-
mined.
But behind the legal double-think,
there are things that the writers are
consistently against, and it is for these
that they are being jailed. They
oppose the omissions and incomplete-
ness of the de-Stalinisa.tion campaign
since 1956 and the quality of life lived
in the shabby, suburban megapolis of
Moscow; the personal problems of bore-
dom and depression augmented by the
restrictions imposed by the massive
bureaucracy.
All this together has led, they claim,
to an acute material and spiritual
impoverishment, to what Dr. Eugene
Kamenka of the ANU has described
as “a mixture of sullenness and
cynicism which makes the most ordinary
social relations between Russians ex-
tremely unpleasant” and as a “boorish
unintelligence, and sullen incompetence
about Russian public life.”
For Russians to say all this is to
mention the unmentionable, for it is to-
take a pessimistic, anti-Utopian view
of the situation, which denies the
official myth of optimism and an ever-
improving present. It also denies that
the horrors of the past were simply an
exception: all the essential elements still
exist, terror, illegality, no rights, cover-
ing up the past.
How did they become like this? How
is it that a few men, brought up in a
closed system of conditioning and in-
doctrination, never having tasted free-
dom and isolated from it, with nothing
to guide them, can suddenly stand up
against the whole system in the name
of qualities they have never experi-
enced? A partial explanation may be
provided by our knowledge that many
of them were in contact with that
circle, which included Svetlana Stalin,
who were conversant with modern
Western life, particularly that of the
U.S.A. For a fuller explanation, we
would have to look at three striking
features; many are young, many are
poets, many are followers of the Rus-
sian Christian humanism of the Ber-
dayev variety.
To take poetry: it is not the much-
vaunted technocrats, managers, or the
consumer revolution, but the poets, and
the most apolitical ones at that, who
are attempting to change Soviet society.
Totalitarian politics and poetry cannot
abide one another. Every great poet
since the Revolution has been harassed
by the regime, many to death, and it
still goes on.
The poets aren’t arguing against or
even about Marxism, Leninism, Com-
munism, theories of the State, revolu-
tionary action, ideology, political struc-

tures. They don’t think politically in
this way; they are just saying: at present
I find the regime hypocritical and
repressive, its atmosphere poisoned, and
I want to say this and show it. This
appears simple, but it is ultimately
subversive of the regime’s intentions.
The writers can be completely against
the mentality, yet not “anti-Soviet” in
the sense of being revolutionary (though
the KGB is doing its best to make them
so).
Ginsburg concludes his letter to
Kosygin: “But I love my country and
I do not wish to see its name sullied
by the latest unchecked activities of
the KGB. I love Russian literature
and I do not wish to see two more
writers sent off, under guard, to fell
trees.”
This statement is moving and im-
pressive because it is the opposite of
hysterical; its affirmation is achieved
through directness and restraint. The
clear, calm anger which underlies these
complaints shows that the writers are
able to reject the regime without re-
jecting the burdens under which all
men live.
The same tone of apparent modera-
tion is seen in the original method
they have evolved of dealing with the
legal apparatus which provides the
facade of liberalisation. They can play
the double-think game, too. They
accept on face value the authorities’
professed concern for legality, demo-
cratic process, civil liberties, and the
rights of opposition which is all writ-
ten into the law. When these are
flouted, as they often are, they pains-
takingly document, with meticulous
attention to constitutional and legal
detail, and with deadly clarity, the
discrepancy between the provisions of
the law and what happens in practice,
e.g., with regard to the hearing of
witnesses.
They even dare in this style to parody
the jargon of official statements.
Voznesensky said, when prevented from
going to the U.S.A. on the pretext of
illness: “Of course, the leaders of the
Union of Writers must know what they
are doing, but why haven’t they in-
formed me that I am sick?”
These tactics of using the weapons
of liberalisation have, paradoxically,
brought liberalisation itself to a stand-
still. In Stalin’s day, victims disap-
peared overnight, to languish in camps
or die by summary execution.
But once you have a trial, no matter
how bogus, defendants can speak,
transcripts can be leaked out, sen-
tences can be known, others can protest
even if they are ignored or punished
for it. If the victims are kept alive, not
killed, they stay somewhere in our
minds as a sort of continuing cause
celebre, which keeps the issue of their
fate alive.
Today’s sentences, relatively mild
compared with the past, have, strangely,
caused more harm to the Soviet image
than the many earlier murders.
Not so grand
By CHARLES HIGH AM
Robert Frost: The Early Years: 1874-
1915. Lawrance Thompson. Cape.
63/- sterling.
“WHAT A MAN will put into effect
at any cost of time or money or life
or lives is sacred, and what counts.”
These are the last words of the first
volume of Lawrance Thompson’s
monumental life of Robert Frost, and
they express a sentiment which drove
the poet on against the misfortunes of
a modern Job, a decade of neglect, and
the almost constant threat of mental,
emotional, and financial collapse.
Like so many artists, Frost was not
only prepared to sacrifice his own hap-
piness in pursuit of the ideal organis-
ation of art, but that of his friends as
well. This is a book which is far from
being an example of hero worship or
hagiography: lay down its massive
weight on a table for the last time and
you can no longer accept the famous
public image of Frost as a grizzled elder
statesman of American verse.
Frost’s poetry, lucid, conversational,
wry, was wrung from experience which
would have ruined the psyche of any-
one less resolute. His father was a
journalist on the San Francisco “Even-
ing Bulletin,” a handsome and engaging
man whose early death was caused by
tuberculosis and an addiction to whisky.
His mother was a mystical, visionary
poetess, sensitive, devout but un-
balanced, his sister Jeanie a strange
hysterical girl, who struggled along as
teacher and artist’s model until she
succumbed to mental illness and died
in an institution in 1929.
Frost’s relationship with his wife,
Elinor, was equally marked by distress,
and his jealous rage damaged their
courtship. He lost two children in
infancy. Reading Thompson’s account
of squabbles, recriminations, threats of
suicide or murder, the dark moments
when Frost’s mind threatened to give
way, we are reminded of the stark
tragedy of Eugene O’Neill.
Professionally, Frost’s life at first pro-
vided little compensation for his per-
sonal misfortunes. He left Dartmouth
College without completing his first
academic year, and Harvard did not
keep him long. He battled as school-
teacher and farmer, saved from total
ruin by a small inheritance from his
grandfather, and dogged constantly by
the vagaries of the New England
climate. His poetry was rejected by
the famous magazines of America, and
he fretted constantly at obscurity. Yet
from his life on the farm he gained
the homespun grassroots honesty and
simplicity of his best work and its
cleansing New England tone.
In 1912 Frost finally decided to go
to England and seek the literary fame
that had so far eluded him in America.
He was 38, almost broke, and saddled
with a family, yet he managed to
establish himself quickly, with the aid
Frost in 1913 . . . driving ambition
of a driving ambition which got him to
the attention of the young Ezra Pound
via the minor poet F. S. Flint. Pro-
fessor Thompson rather cynically
records Frost’s flattery of Flint, his.
using him as a lever to get to Pound.
Frost’s first slim volume, “A Boy’s
Will,” was slowly acknowledged, and
when Harriet Monro’s newly formed
Chicago magazine “Poetry” accepted
Frost as a talent to be watched he was
clearly on his way.
At the end of the book, we are left
with Frost on the threshold of the
great career that culminated in his
appearance on the scene of Kennedy’s
America as a noble sage, the Grand
Old Man of transatlantic letters.

Very personal
By JOHN BAXTER
A Flag On The Island. V. S. Naipaul.
Andre Deutsch. $3.15.
READING NAIPAUL’S WORK gives
one a feeling rather like having swal-
lowed a penny. The pieces in this
collection of short stories seem diges-
tible enough, but no amount of
thought and analysis causes them to
yield up any secrets. They are what
they are, and the reader who does not
find them especially meaningful must
be assumed to have missed the point.
Naipaul’s background is obviously
at the root of this curious effect. The
world about which he writes is a
bifurcated one reflecting his origins;
born of Indian parentage in Trinidad,
he has lived both in the West Indies
and London. Some of the stories in
this collection are memoirs from boy-
hood, others the most effective of
them observations of life in Eng-
land or elsewhere written from the
detached view of an experienced writer.
Whatever their setting, however, his
sketches deal invariably with the prob-
lems of an outsider alienated from his
environment.
It is difficult to become involved
with the more personal stories in this
book, so deeply rooted are they in
the personal world of Naipaul’s child-
hood. “My Aunt Gold Teeth,” “The
Heart,” and “The Enemy” are all
scraps of experience from the begin-
nings of memory; erratically expressed
reminiscences of family pets, eccentric
relatives, quaint and occasionally sinis-
ter customs of a life totally alien to
us. Only “The Mourners,” with its
cool observation of self-pity in a
bereaved Indian family, offers us any-
thing of universality.
The writer’s skill seems more mean-
ingfully demonstrated in the stories
which come closer to humor or realism.
“The Baker’s Story” and “The Night-
watchman’s Occurrence Book” are
slight but amusing, a relief from the
obscurity of the more personal works.
The former is no more than a broad
farce about the irregularities of a
large tourist hotel, but by telling the
story in the form of increasingly
hysterical memos from the semi-literate
nightwatchman to his employer,
Naipaul makes it into a sub-Marx
Brothers romp.
This, one gathers, was at least part
of his intent in the long title novelette,
but the necessities of developing a
strong and sympathetic central charac-
ter the story was reputedly writ-
ten as the basis of a film script, thank-
fully never shot confuse hopelessly
the humorous approach. The nearest
comparison one can think of is “Can-
nery Row,” but Naipaul’s depiction
of colorful low life on an island before
and after its emergence as a “resort”
lacks Steinbeck’s American roughness
and sentimentality. The parody is
labored, the “dialogue, action, and sex,”
which the author was allegedly asked
to insert for Hollywood’s sake, feeble
in the extreme. Naipaul’s fanciers
may find these stories interesting foot-
notes to his distinguished oeuvre, but
new admirers may well wish to avoid
it and retain their admiration intact.
Race warrior
By PHILLIP ADAMS
Dutchman. Leroi Jones. Faber and
Faber. 60c.
LEROI JONES has been sentenced
to two and a half years in the New
Jersey State Prison. Apparently he
and two Negro friends were toting
guns at the height of Newark’s sum-
mer riots. And to make matters worse
the sentencing judge had been read-
ing some of Jones’ Black Power poetry
in the Greenwich Village literary jour-
nal “Evergreen Review.” A poem read-
ing, in part, “We must make our own
world, and we cannot do this unless the
white man is dead” was a bit much
for His Honor, who imposed on
Jones a jail-term of record severity.
The poem, in fact, seems to have added
at least a year to the normal sentence.
Now the Jones case looks like being
a major civil rights issue. However, a
Uganda journal called “Transition”
takes a dim view of Jones’ literary
abilities. “His anger is justified,” they
commented, “but it is distorted by the
kind of political narcissism which
always infects causes already lost.”
While a transcript of the dialogue
between Jones and his judge makes
for better theatre than his play, “Dutch-
man” is not without impact, involving,
as it does, much blunt eroticism, in-
dignant ranting, and a murder.
Clay, its hero, is a clean-cut 20-
year-old Negro who went to college,
read Baudelaire, and dresses Ivy
League. When we meet him he is com-
muting by train to a middle-class
suburb. Lena—nicknamed the Hyena—
sits beside him. She’s a 30-year-old
white woman of excessive and warped
sexuality, and commences publicly to
excite the young man. He tries to keep
his cool, but is angered by her obscen-
ities and racial viciousness. Lena
promptly murders him, and easily per-
suades the other white occupants of
the train to cover for her.
Given brilliant principals and harsh
production the short piece would cer-
tainly have the quality of a night-
mare. And given the intellectual en-
vironment foisted on Leroi Jones, the
play’s psychical and physical brutality is
wholly appropriate. However, as Jones’
wrath is greater than his talent, the
play is finally more hysterical than
cathartic. As “Transition” put it,
“He is an immature race warrior.”

Times when
comparisons
are envious
I OFTEN THINK that we should stop
comparing our wines, either chip on
shoulder or wave the banners high
boys, with those from overseas. Aus-
tralian wine is Australian wine.
For comparisons, though harmless,
are endless. I dined last week with a
surgeon, a barrister, a consulting
engineer, and four exciting women. The
evening started well with ribaldry,
philosophy, fire, brimstone, and
laughter, but was soon bogged down
in a marsh of matching wines. “Don’t
you think this has a hint of Beaune?”
“This reminds me of a Tavel,” and on.
Often this is quite valid, though I
can’t see the French at table claiming
they can detect a Coonawarra charac-
ter in a Chateau Margaux. And though
the McWilliam’s Mount Pleasant Pinot
Hermitage of ’6l does resemble a
slightly oaky Burgundy, and the ’5B
Drayton’s tastes something like a Pom-
erol, they are both quite obviously from
the Hunter.
One favorite recent comparison was
the Mildara Coonawarra Cabernet Sau-
vignon 1963 to a top Bordeaux. True,
it was made from the same type of
grapes and matured in like oak, but
there the comparison ends. The pepper-
mint nose alone effects this, an ending
at the beginning. And why search for
similarities, anyway? The Mildara
wine is simply a very good red from
a top region of Australia.
Of course, things are different at a
masked tasting. You’re on your own,
boy. At the same dinner I picked a
Mildara Hunter/Coonawarra of 1958
as a French claret. The fact that I’ve
made the same mistake every year for
the past five years didn’t make it any
better. (Though I do remember Les
Ekert, the celebrated wine judge, doing
the same thing at lunch one day about
four years ago. He praised the wine no
end, said it was a top Bordeaux, and
was slightly embarrassed when the
wrappings came off. You see, as a
former wine-maker of Mildara wines,
he had put the wine together in the
first place.)
But, other than these examples, there
are not many mistakes made by experi-
enced tasters. Our Rhine Rieslings,
though having excellent fruity floweri-
ness, lack the intensity of flavor of the
top German whites on the middle
palate. Possibly the Orlando Steingarten
and Yalumba Pewsey Vale operations
will correct this. Equally possibly they
may develop a wonderful character all
of their own. Of our red wines, those
made from Black Shiraz, and that is
most of them, only vaguely resemble
the red wines of the Rhone Valley,
which are based on the same variety.
They are of the same broad style, and
there it ends.
One style that we keep entirely to
ourselves is the Liqueur Muscat, that
delightful end-of-dinner drink. I can-
not understand why it is not more
popular. For one thing it is such in-
credible value. All Saints have a splen-
did standard Muscat available for some-
thing close to a dollar, and the Morriss’
at the Mia Mia Winery near Rutherglen
have a ten-year-old blend that sells for
just one dollar a bottle. Even their top
Show Liqueur Muscat, a blend of wines
about 20 years old, but including some
going back 50 years, is only $2.50 a
bottle. And this has won so many Gold
Medals they’ve lost count. Those of
you going to the Rutherglen Wine Festi-
val on the long weekend (Bth to 11th
of March) will be able to go and see
for yourselves. These wines are cer-
tainly more heavy and viscous than any
other of the endless Muscatels, Musca-
dels, Moscatoe, or Muscadines over
there. That is, now.
Once upon a time there was a won-
derful dessert wine called Constantia.
It came from a tiny pocket of land
south of Cape Town. The vineyards
were established by Simon van der
Stel when the Dutch colonised the area
in the 17 th century, and were re-
habilitated by Hendrik Cloete a
hundred-odd years later. He concen-
trated on making a rich, heavy, sweet
dessert wine that became so popular in
Europe that it was for some time the
most expensive wine in the world. It
was all the rage. It was said to be
the favorite wine of Napoleon in exile.
Kings raved over it. Then the fakers
took over, sold all sorts of wine under
the label, and the bottom dropped out
of the barrel.
Today Bertrams lease the historic
buildings and vineyards from the Gov-
ernment and make a Constantia. But it
is not the same thing. The interesting
point is that Constantia was made
from Muscat de Frontignan grapes, or
Frontignac to you. The Rutherglen
muscats are made from Brown Muscat,
their name, which is almost certainly
a member of the Frontignac family.
Probably the pink one. With age, the
color of these wines deepens and fin-
ally becomes a rich shade of brown.
Now Walter James quotes Huysmans
on Constantia. “A color of onion skins
slightly burnt, smacking of old Malaga
and Port, but with a sugary bouquet of
its own, and an after-taste of grapes
whose juices have been condensed and
sublimated by burning suns.”
Heavens, he could be talking of our
sl-a-bottle Liqueur Muscat. Could it
be that Australia has revived the
fabled dessert wine of the Cape?

NOTES FROM LINDEMAN'S
CELLAR MANAGER:
The 1968 vintage commenced at Ben
Ean last week in good weather and the
fruit handled so far has been in first-
class condition. The high January rain-
fall of 9 inches apparently did little
damage, although no doubt the fruit
will be juicier than normal and slightly
lower in sugar content. Yields so far have
been good, and the pre-vintage crop
estimate indicated a vintage similar in
quantity to that of 1967.
The provision of further refrigeration,
and an extra air-bag grape press at Ben
Ean should see a further improvement
in quality, although in this field it is
the care with which the juice and the
wine is handled, rather than the actual
equipment, which is of paramount im-
portance. Our Ben Ean manager, Mr.
Karl Stockhausen, is fully aware of this,
and to him must go the credit for our
long line of superb Hunter River Valley
Rieslings, Chablis, and White Burgundies
wines immediately recognisable by the
connoisseur for their freshness, cleanness,
delicacy, and flavour.
Our policy of very early bottling in
Sydney under ideal conditions merely
ensures that the wine’s quality and
attractiveness are maintained into the
bottle. At the same time experience has
shown the long-term advantages of this
care and treatment, typified at a recent
tasting of pint bottles of Bin 224 Hock,
1954 vintage. Generally pint bottles
mature and age much faster than quart
bottles, but the Bin 224 still tasted fresh
and clean, with a long life in front of it.

LETTERS
Australian Poetry, 1967
I notice with alarm that your
poetry correspondent, Alexander
Craig (8., Feb. 10), who seems to
be close to informed sources, is
beating the drum about what he
calls, to the accompaniment of an
odium, dimeters, trimeters, tetrameters,
pentameters, and alexandrines. He
writes as though he hates the things.
They do indeed sound frightening. What
are they? I have just been reading a
science-fiction story in which the earth
is invaded by creatures called tripeds,
who proceed to paralyse the human
race. Is poetry threatened by a similar
invasion? Mr. Craig’s report on “Aus-
tralian Poetry 1967” also mentions
other frightening creatures and condi-
tions—couplets, quatrains, presageful
climaxes, urbanised landscapes, idio-
matic dictions, economic flexibilities,
stanzaic and metrical frameworks, col-
loquial immediacies, functional buoy-
ancies, coalescing images, and some-
thing that is “partly vitiated.” Mr.
Craig warns me, for one, that the
anthology includes a poem of mine in
which there are “labored pentameter
couplets”; and he warns everyone that
just about all the poems included are
at least half-paralysed. He himself has
happily managed to avoid inclusion,
and I rejoice for him. But, unless I am
supposed to accept his report as being
another science-fiction story —help. Can
I have some of his gas, or a bit of
Bulletin space, with which to fight
these filthy perils? What do they look
like? Where do they come from? Can
they multiply? If they break out
among the public at large there is no
telling what might happen. It would
be terrible to be taken in mid-stride by
a clutch of coalescing images.

S.A.'s social welfare
If Mr. Brian Buckley, in writing on
Mr. Don Dunstan (8., Feb. 3), had
made a relatively simple, impartial
check of some of the material put
before him, he would have found that
there has never been any legislation in
South Australia known as “Social Wel-
fare Acts” or Act perhaps Mr. Buck-
ley was attempting to tell your readers
of the Maintenance Act, revised by the
present Government.
“The provision of adequate assistance
to households without a male head is
recognised by social workers as an event
of major social importance.” I hasten
to assure your Mr. Buckley that as a
family social worker such an “event,”
had it occurred, would be of major
social importance. Again, had Mr.
Buckley done a little objective inquiry
he would have learned that there is now
no State Social Welfare Relief assis-
tance to Widow Pensioners in S.A.
Prior to Mr. Dunstan’s Labor Adminis-
tration, that is, during the days of “Tom
Playford and two typists,” there was,
though nominal, at least such a source
of State Relief assistance to Widow
Pensioners. This group would, I under-
stand, constitute the greatest number
of “households without a male head,”
to which Mr. Buckley referred.
It is doubtful, therefore, whether on
facts Mr. Buckley would have been able
to state as he did that “South Australia
is in a position of clear leadership over
other States in Social Welfare.” I do
hope that Mr. Buckley’s superficial
glance in South Australia’s direction,
and the resultant blindness he suffered
from the brilliance of the “Star,” is a
temporary affliction which may,
through editorial treatment and policy,
be remedied.
Lorraine R. Price
Linden Park, S.A.
I was amazed and disgusted by the
eulogistic and biased article on Mr.
Dunstan in The Bulletin (Feb. 3). No
mention was made of the fact of South
Australia’s unemployment figure being
consistently higher than that of other
States ever since his Government took
office. Only now, with an election
imminent, is any effort being made to
promote South Australia’s industrial
expansion, and that by bringing in
outside advisers at disproportionate
cost.

Money on the move
I note the remarks by Mr. Hay-
thorpe (8., Feb. 3) re previously pub-
lished material on “Keeping the
World’s Money on the Move.” He
asks a question which an increasing
number are asking, “What is wrong
with the system?”
Your Financial Editor’s comments on
“Money on the Move” do not answer
the question—they merely prompt it.
Covering two pages and complete with
graphs, and making continuous refer-
ence to such terms as “protect the
dollar,” “foreign reserves,” “interna-
tional trading,” “foreign trade,” “gold
stocks,” etc., etc., we find no reference
to “individual survival,” “personal
security,” “social contrasts,” or “sub-
sistence level.” Reference made else-
where to the futility of “digging holes
in the ground to procure gold and sub-
sequently putting it in another hole in
the ground at Fort Knox” appears to
be the ultimate limit in futility but, as
a noted writer remarked, “Nothing is
as fantastic as the dramatic presenta-
tion of fact.”
Finally, in a belated effort to offer
something more constructive, may I
suggest that we reverse our thinking
in regard to currency? Instead of con-
sidering money from the point of view
of returns —in the form of dividends,
interest, or even primary investments—
that we consider money as: a negotiable
receipt for one’s contribution to general
production?

Brisbane way
Melbourne’s sport-for-profit Sundays,
reported by Batman (8., Feb. 17), may
have a ridiculous side, but Brisbane
now has an even stranger rule. We can
have approval for the noisiest Sunday
outdoor events, but not indoor ones.

Catholics and Masons
Your correspondent K. G. Halbert
(8., Feb. 10) writes about the growing
tolerance of Masons and Catholics not
holding interest for the growing genera-
tion, but he presents his comments
much too vaguely to make a lucid
impression. All one gains from his
rather obscure observations, and inco-
herent statements, also his execrable
aggregation of consonantal poly-
syllables, is that the “up-and-coming”'
new breed of “Dinkum Aussies” will
be taking only an apathetic view of the
so-called growing tolerance between
the Freemasons and Roman Catholics,
and that is putting it mildly. His
assertions that Roman Catholicism
somewhat resembles Freemasonry is to
a degree appreciated, but both are
founded on a doctrine that, to quote
Sir Marcus Oliphant, is “totally inade-
quate for this age.”
The prelate knows much more of
church history, of dogma, of liturgy,
but men of science knew much more
of God’s universe and of man than the
prelates—so that, as all right-thinking
men would agree, Freemasonry to-
gether with Roman Catholicism can
only face up to a slowly declining
future.
Concluding, may I ask, “Why be
concerned over whether there is a grow-
ing tolerance or not?” The fact, as I
see it, still remains that a profound
tolerant alliance could scarcely be
formed between Catholics and Masons
when it is realised that for centuries
one has always been poignantly opposed
to the other in both temperament and
ideals.
