LITERARY NOTES.
Writers publishing a book must needs be
far more daring than the aboriginal who
takes stand behind a duodecimo heelaman'
and dares the flight of stones sent whizzing
his lithe-armed tribesmen. Nobody
bothers to secure a sinless conscience before
casting critical pebbles. And since, once
in print, your defensive words are fixtures,
and bright eye and nimble wrist no longer
avail, there lie open to the assailant many
tender parts which the stiffest and most
rheumatic King Billy will defend with a
hardly perceptible flexure of the shield-arm.
Here, for example, is a bit of blue-metal
which “ The Banjo ” cannot dodge :
Dear Bulletin,— l am a man with a grievance
—not against the Government this time, nor the
editor, but against your “Banjo.” For the last
few years I have sworn by “ The Banjo ”; now I
Bwear at him. Ever since I read “Clancy of the
Overflow” I have been longing to visit the Over-
flow and get acquainted with Clancy; and if he
had gone to Queensland droving I intended to
hunt out where he are. At some inconvenience I
lately paid a visit to the Overflow ; but what did
I find ? There was not a soul on the station who
knew Clancy—they had never heard of him, in
fact. Much disgusted, I questioned one of the
station-hands : “ Don’t you read your Bulletin ? ”
“ Yes.” “ Then did you never read of Clancy of
the Overflow?” “Oh, yes,” he said, “ I fancy I
do remember a bit of potery about him.” Yah !
Then, as regards Dandaloo, which “ The Banjo ”
has immortalised, why, it is quite a common oc-
currence for Dandaloo drunks to get “bushed”
whilst travelling from one Dandaloo pub. to an-
other. I have not been to the Snowy River, nor
do I intend to go—l have lost too many fond
illusions as it is—but I may remark incident-
ally that every man I have met who hails from that
place has been an unmitigated blatherskite. Those
Monaro riders must always stay at home—pro-
bably they are snowed in. There is a rush at
Ironbark —a good one, too; half-an-ounce to the
dish—but wild horses will not drag me there, for
if the man from Ironbark should also prove to be
a myth my small stock of faith in mankind would
entirely disappear. And lastly, dear Bulletin,
were you ever in Menindie ?—dear little Menindie,
noted for its burning sandhills and whisky—also
burning. If so, you will be as curious as lam to
know where they got the green barley that they
stuffed into Old Pardon, the son of Reprieve.
There never was anything green about Menindie,
but I know plenty of men who have at times
painted it red. Finally—but never mind.—Yours
disgustedly, Feed Bkadshaw.
* * * *
Hardly so well aimed is a London missile
which reached the outskirts of its mark by
mail before last. The Pall Mall Gazette,
indeed, in its lengthy notice of “The Man
from Snowy River,” has thrown more rose-
leaves than turfs. E.g. :
Mr. Paterson is, without a doubt, a very good
writer indeed of a kind of verse which is as legiti-
mate a department of the art as epigrams or vers
de societe. And he need not, we venture to think,
fear the inevitable comparison with Adam Lind-
say Gordon. If the present volume contains
nothing quite as good as “The Sick Stockrider ”
and “ How we Beat the Favorite,.” it is at any
rate free from those pale reflections of Swinburne,
and that weak sentimentalism that fill two-thirds
of Gordon’s collected writings. Mr. Paterson, too,
has the finer gift of humor.
And again :
In a more serious vein, in conveying an impres-
sion, of the vast Australian solitudes, Mr. Pater-
son is at his best. He often shows real poetical
power, as distinguished from the cleverness and
fun which characterise most of his verses. “ The
Travelling Post Office” is one of these vivid
picture-pieces., more successful, we think, than the
actual narratives in verse, the genuine ballads,
though some of these are very good.
• • • •
Then by-and-by, at the tail of the article,
whiz ! comes the clod :
It is a pity that a writer who can make verse
of this quality, and who so often gives proof of
considerable technical skill, should occasionally
annoy his more critical readers by introducing
into his verses the unpardonable offence known
as the Cockney rhyme. Had it not been for this
we should have been even more enthusiastic about
Mr. Patterson ; but “loss ” does not, even in the
Antipodes, rhyme with “horse,” or “louder”
with “Judah” —no, not though every swagman
and stockrider on the Murrumbidgee, supported
by the entire editorial staff of the Sydney Bulle-
tin, should arise and testify to the contrary.
Alas, for British ignorance ! Did the writer
of this unenlightened commentary ever own
ahorse? Did he ever race one? “Loss”
doesn’t rhyme with “ horse,” quotha ! Why,
no such perfect rhyme was ever penned !
. The coincidence is absolute. As for com-
plaining of “louder” and “Judah”—good
Hebrews ! The Bulletin invites the Pall
Mall scribe to pass once—just once—through
the Valley of the Shadow of the Nose on any
Australian racecourse ; listen once—just
once—to Father Abraham, brother Isaac,
and son Jacob calling the odds ; and there-
after for ever squat on “The Banjo’s”
threshold in sackcloth and tote-tickets and
ashes and abasement.
HE * * *
A Cockney rhyme—what is it exactly ?
The dictionaries—even Dr. Murray’s big one
—don’t know, or won’t tell. But one guesses
it to be a rhyme favored by the hot young
writers whom the century-beginning let out
on the loose with a latch-key—Shelley, and
Keats, and Leigh Hunt, and Hazlitt, and all
that goodly company. At any rate, a bitter
Blackwood contributor dubbed their school
the Cockney school, and where else but in
the Cockney school should Cockney rhymes
be taught ?
* * * *
One knows, of course, by observation and
allusion, that a Cockney rhyme is an imper-
fect rhyme, with—should there not be ?
some straining of vowels involved, some mal-
treatment of consonants. The familiar
“dawn” and “morn,” “childhood” and
“wild wood,” are typical Cockney rhymes,
and they do grate on a critical ear. But
presumably assonance, with better-defined
consonants and vowels perfectly chiming
( mean and peer, robe and
“tome”), would not fall under the ban.
You cannot call the whole of Spanish
poetry Cockney. A Cockney rhyme is
not, then, a clean half-rhyme, or a bold
no-rhyme-at-all, but a hypocrite which
assumes the virtue it hath" not, a coin
which shines golden and rings base counter-
feit. Thus—if you put us on our oath—
“loss” and “horse,” “louder” and
lt T j i „ o ■. i j itmv
“ Judah are Cockney rhymes, and The
Banjo has sinned against Style.
* * * *
But suppose he had sinned against Thought
—were not his offence the graver ? Suppose,
» *■* “ <*
louder as a rhyme to the difficult “Judah,
he had sacrificed the good and characteristic
touch —
Says Jimmy : “ The children of Judah
Are out on the warpath to-day
and inserted something weaker, such as (on
the pen of the moment)
Says Jimmy : “ A concert at Chowder
Sings small beside Ikey Mo’s lay
would he have been the better verser ? It
seems not. This, of course, is neither ex-
cuse nor justification. It is the duty of the
perfect poet to put perfect thought into
perfect form, and a reasonable cavil may he
made at the imperfection of a poet who falls
short of the utmost possible on any line,
But, since humanity is imperfect, and poeti-
cal humanity plusquamimperfect, and a door
must be either open or shut, what is the
poet to do ? Is he to keep in the heat or
admit the draught ?—to prefer an imperfect
thought in perfect rhyme, or a perfect
thought in imperfect rhyme, or a mode-
rately-imperfect ditto in a moderately-
perfect ditto ?
* * * *
On the whole, it seems the thought carries
it. Yet there are amplifications and differen-
tiations and reservations. A rhyme which
would be execrable in “In Memoriam ”
might be permitted in a bush ballad—and
partly for this reason, that often bush ears
do not appreciate demi-semi-tones of prosody,
Many untrained or half-trained readers see
littleorno difference between a quarter-rhyme
and a whole one ; while they are keenly
conscious of the difference between a weak
or ill-expressed idea and a strong or well-
expressed idea. Why should a writer, who
can give them the ideas they value, cease to
compose, or compose only half as much,
because he cannot give them the form which
they value little or not at all ? In other
words, why cease supplying chops to people
who don’t want patd-de-foie-gras ?
When the reader has reached just here, he
will notice that j ust here the introduction of
some amoroua verses which “ S.-W.” has
written for B m, trait comes quite tnal-
,. .
apropos. They are introduced accordingly ;
This turns young Eros’s old theme dexter-
ously enough: face, eyes, mouth, breast, limbs
—she is all there. The male poet loves detail
in his amorous cuplets ; but why is the
female, at times quite as amorous, so much
more vague and general in her epithets ? It
isn’t in character. Woman, the natural
observer, who notes with microscopic eye the
minutest triviality of garb or wearer, must
see all the good and bad points of her lovers :
why doesn’t she dilate on them in print
as her lovers dilate on hers? Certainly
she does not: Sappho’s Phaon is only an
indistinct lump of loveliness, while Catullus
scrutinises Lesbia’s teeth with the anxiety of a
horse-dealer. “A mouth like a Gallic beagle,”
he says one lady had. Modem Sapphos are
content to describe their heroes as being
“beautiful as a young Greek god,” and
so on ; but they never specify anything
beautiful about him except his clothes, or his
nose, or some such irrelevancy. Even Mrs.
Raggles, of the U.S., whom a U.S. paper
praises for the taste implied in her remark
after visiting Europe : “ Well, I’ve seen the
Apollo Belvideer an’ I’ve seen Raggles, an’
gimme Raggles ! ” —even this exponent of
culture didn’t mention wherein lay Raggles’s
preeminence. Yet the most superficial study
of Swinburne, say, will show any average
woman what the average man prizes her for.
You bet that even Raggles, sitting spitting
at the stove in an Arizona saloon, and talking
heifer to the boys, would give them a re-
markably definite picture of the excellences
of his old girl. Now, since the literary and
poetic Male puts everything in writing, as it
were, why does the ditto Female play her
accepted instincts false in this one particular ?
Why doesn’t she retaliate, and compensate,
and elaborate ? The world is full up and
running over with the poetry of woman’s
eyes and limbs : let us hear the other side.
A WISH.
O, the face and the eyes and the mouth of her.
The breast where a man might laugh to die I
The fragrant limbs and the youth of her,
And the flush that oomes when it scarce knows
why !
Ah, float me far from the teen of life
Alone on a hill in her warm soft hold,
In the light of a glowing sunset, rife
With hues of purple and green and gold.
Lay my tired face on her shoulder clear,
My arm where the pride of her heart beat?
through ;
And open her eyes to my own eyes near—
Then the world and its glory be all to you !

COUGHS. COLDS ON THE CHEST BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or. soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.— Dear Sir,— Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I surfeied
for upwards of seven years, during which period 1 was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the mm-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
get ting very much worse, and at tiie time X obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
ns I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. vVALiK.bR,
Balmain, Sydney.” ...
" My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 ra ° nt h®-
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
m nts. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
SU “Tbought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this «"«*£*?*
XO days he was perfectly cured. —J. PAIIRRoUIN,

WARNER’S
wa&
The Old Reliable.
Disease Is an effect, not a cause. Its origin
Is within; its manifestations without. Hence,
to cure the disease the cause must be removed,
and in no other way can a cure ever be ef-
fected. Warner’s Safe Cure is established on
lust this principle. It realises that
95 PER CENT.
of all diseases arise from deranged Kidneys
and Liver, and it strikes at once at the root
of the difficulty. The elements of which it is
composed act directly upon these great organs,
both as a food and restorer, and, by placing
them in a healthy condition, drive disease and
pain from the system.
For the innumerable troubles caused by
unhealthy Kidneys, Liver and Urinary Organs •
for the distressing Disorders of Women: for
all Nervous Affections, and physical derange-
ments generally, this great remedy has no
equal. Its past record is a guarantee of
continued performance.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HOW THE “FIRE-KING” CROSSED THE
SWAMP.
The flood was down in the Wilga Swamps, three
feet over the mud,
And the teamsters camped on the Wilga Range
and swore at the rising flood ; •
For one by one they had tried the trip, double and-
treble-teams,
And one after one each desert-ship had dropped to
her axle-beams ;
So they thonged their leaders and pulled them
round to the camp on the sandhill’s crown,
And swore by the bond of a.blood-red oath to
wait till the floods went down. ,
There were “side rail tubs” and “ table-tops,’
coaches and bullock-drays, .
Brown with the Barcoo Wonders, and Speed with
the dapple grays
Who pulled the front of his waggon out and left
the rest in the mud
At the Cuttaburra Crossing in'the grip of the
Ninety flood. ,
There was Burt with his sixteen bullpcks, and
never a bullock to shirk,
Who twice came over the Border Line with twelve-
ton-ten to Bourke;
There was Long Dick damning an agent’s eyes for
his ton of extra weight,
And Whistling Jim, for Cobb and Co., cursing that
mails were’ late ;
And one blasphemed at a broken chair and howled
for a blacksmith’s blood,
And most of them cursed their blasted luck, and
all of them cursed the flood.
The last of the baffled had struggled back and the
sun was low in the sky,
And the first of the stars was creeping out when
Dareaway Dan came by. i’ '
There’s never a teamster draws to Bourke but has
taken the help' of 'Dan ;'
There’s never a team on the Great North Road can
lift as the big roans can :
Broad - hipped beauties that nothing can stop,
■ leaders that swing to a cough ;
Eight blue-roans on the near-side yoked, and
eight red-roans on the off.
And Long Dick called from his pine-rail bunk :
“ Where are you bound so quick ? ”
And Dareaway Dan spoke low to the roans, and
aloud, “ To the Swagman’s, Dick.”
“There’s five good miles,” said the giant, “ lie to
the front of you, holding mud ;
If you never were stopped before, old man, you
are stopped by ,the Wilga flood ;. . n
The dark will be down in an hour or so, there isn't
the ghost of a moon,
So leave your nags in the station grass instead of
the long lagoon ! ”
But Dan stood, up to his leader’s head and fondled
the big brown nose :
. “ There’s many a mile in the roan team yet before
they are feed for the crows ; ,
Now listen, Dick-with-the-woman’s-heart, a word
to you and the rest :
I’ve sixteen horses collared and chained, the pick
of the whole wide West,
And I’ll cut their throats and leave them here to
rot if they haven’t the power
To carry me through to the gates of Hell —with
seventy bags of flour !
The light of the stars is light enough ; they have
nothing to do but plough ;
There’s never a swamp has held them yet, and a
swamp won’t stop them now.
They’re waiting for flour at the Swagman’s Bend ;
I’ll steer for the lifting light; .
There’s nothing to fear with a team like mine, and
—I camp in the bed to-night ! ”
So they stood aside and they watched them pass
to the glow of the sinking sun,
With straining muscles and tightened chains
sixteen pulling like one ;
With jingling harness aind. droning wheels and
- bare hoofs’rhythmic tramp, •' ' “

•“Fire King ” faced the f swamp ; •
She dipped her red' shafts low in the slush as a
. spoonbill .dips-lier beak, : r -I.’ . 1 .
The black mud clung to the wheels and fell m the
wash of the Wilga Creek ;
And the big roans fought for footing, and the
spreaders threshed like flails,
And the great wheels lifted the muddy spume to
the bend of the red float-rails ;
And they cheered him out to the westward with
the last of the failing light
And the splashing’hoofs'and the drivers voice
died softly away in the night;
But some of them prate of a shadowy form that
guided the leader’s reins,.
And some of them speak of a shod black horse
that pulled in the off-side chains—
How every time that he lifted his feet the waggon
would groan and swing,
And every time that he dropped his head you
could hear the tug-chains ring.
And Dan to the Swagman’s Bend came through ;
mud-spattered from foot to head,
And they couldn’t tell which of the roans were
blue and which of the roans were red.
Now this is the tale as I heard it told, and many
beiieve it true
When the teamsters say in their off-hand way
“ ’Twas the Devil that pulled him through.”

- Some of the allegations made before a
Melb. Board which is investigating the telephone
muddle' are interesting. One of them is to the
effect that, when a deviation was made between
Richmond and S. Yarra, 12 posts on the old route
which were not wanted but were quite sound and
fit for future use, and worth £1 each, were sold for
4s. 6d. This was done apparently from sheer force
of habit. Then, according to the same witness,
they were cut down and stacked on a vacant allot-
ment, and some soft-footed person stole them in
the night, so that even the 4s. Gd. was never
recovered.

SATURDAY, JULY 18, 1896.
Old Age Pensions.
The old-age pension scheme, which the
Seddon Ministry sprung, the other day, on
Maoriland House of Representatives, is the
very latest development of State Socialism
m these provinces. With this and the State
r ire Insurance scheme and, possibly, the
measure for the establishment of State pawn-
shops, on hand simultaneously, the M.L.
Cabinet certainly has material enough for a
long and riotous session. The fact that the
present is the last session of the existing
Parliament makes this lavishness all the
more remarkable, according to Australian
political standards. The policy of the old
Parkes school of politicians, at such a
time, would be to save up these measures as
a war-cry for the general election ; to stump
the country upon them, and blow the brass
trumpet of party fervour, and blare on the
big tiombone of advertisement, and make
them a means of working up a big majority
at the polls. The Parkes variety of states-
men believed in never doing anything if by
leaving it undone, it could be turned into a
valuable party war-whoop for future use. It
had few ideas—sometimes, in fact, it
had only one ; and it dared not use up its
inspiration too fast lest it should thereby
leave itself without a programme at the next
emergency. The Local Government Bill
for example, hung fire in New South Wales
for thirty years because every politician lived
more or less by professing that he was going
to carry it ; yet none of them really did so
because when once this stereotyped project
was used up no one knew of anything equally
good which he could profess to be going to
do next. The Seddon Ministry has aban-
doned all these old traditions, and is really
trying to do, inside of six years, as many
things as the average statesman lives upon
for thirty or more—not by doing them but
by generally intending to do them. Whether
this prodigality will leave the Government
stranded by-and-bye for want of any more
policy remains to be seen. At all events it
is a pleasant change from the old-time system
under which the country had to wait in-
definitely for reforms because its chronic
placemen had to put them away to live upon
in their old agq, The gradualness of a system
under which it was possible for everybody to
agree on the necessity of a measure) and then
doze over the details of it for thirty .years or
so, grew painfully oppressive.
* * * *
The Old Age Pension scheme is a measure
about the feasibility of which there can be no
serious room for argument. Past experi-
ence, in Germany and elsewhere) has shown,
despite sundry difficulties about matters of
detail, that the system itself is perfectly
workable. The Bill before the M.L. Legis-
lature provides that every citizen, aged 65
°r Upwards, who has been resident in the
province for the preceding 20 years or more,
shall be entitled to a life-pension of 10s. a
week upon application. The residence-quali-
fication is undoubtedly a hardship, but with-
out it Maoriland would become a splendid
place for the old men of all nations to swarm
into, and the scheme would break down by
its own weight. If the other six provinces
should by-and-bye adopt a similar idea, then
the qualification might safely be altered to 20
years’ residence in any part of Australasia,
and, with this limitation, each province could
take the old men and women as they
came, but until this consummation is arrived
at the restriction to old-standing local resi-
dents only is unavoidable. The necessary
funds are to be raised by some method of
taxation not yet definitely decided upon.
The nurden is not by any means so large
as it looks. According to the 1891 census,
the Maoriland inhabitants, male and female,
aged 65 and upwards numbered about.l4,ooo.
Assuming that 12,000 of these—a pretty hi'-di
estimate—were qualified by 20 years’ resi-
dence, the highest possible charge would be
£312,000 a year. But, as a very consider-
able portion of the old inhabitants are in
comfortable circumstances, it is probable
that the outlay, for a population of about
' 00,000 souls, would not exceed £200,000 or
£250,000 a year. On a like estimate, N.S. W.
could run a similar pension-system for, pro-
bably, £400,000 per annum ; Victoria, for
about £550,000 ; Queensland, for £100,000;
S.A., for £150,000 ; and Tasmania, where
the centenarians grow, for about £llO,OOO.
* * * *
This, however, would not be all, or nearly
ail, actual loss. With or without a pension
system the old and indigent inhabitant is a
fact that cannot be disguised. Sometimes
he has never had the means to save up money
to live upon in his last days. Sometimes he
r S means, but has failed to practise
the blessed virtue of economy. Very often
he has made provision with much hard thrift
and foresight, and some fraudulent bank or
exploded company or society, or some other
of the thousand possible commercial disasters,
has reduced him to indigence. There are so
many financial leakages through which the
savings of the masses drop through and
vanish that probably not much more than
half of those who laboriously economise to
provide for their old age ever gain
worth mentioning thereby. Then, if the
aged one has no property, and no relatives
who choose to support him or her as the case
may be, and is incapacitated for labor—and
the labor-market, even for the most ener-
getic person of 65 or upwards, is very flat
indeed—-he -or she must either live on the
community, or die upon it. The community
bears the expense, sometimes by grants
and personal subscriptions in support of
benevolent asylums ; sometimes per medium
of casual charity; sometimes in the cost of
having the ancient run in by a hired police-
man, and hiring a magistrate to send him to
an expensive gaol for vagrancy ; sometimes
by means of the hospital vote or otherwise.
au PP ort him it pays a policeman
to find his body, and a coroner and jury to
inquest him, and an undertaker to bury him.
In some way or other, however, the com-
munity pays for him, alive or dead.
* * * *
rn? 16 amoun t spent on charitable relief is
difficult to arrive at, but reckoning all
Government subsidies, and making a mode-
rate allowance for the great mass of un-
recorded private charity, it is probable that
this item costs Maoriland something like
£400,000 a year, and the other provinces in
a rather larger proportion. The amount ex-
pended on old age pensions would save at
least a part of this outlay, and the increased
burden on the community would probably
be imperceptible. The principal change
would be that the aged and indigent inhabi-
tant, who had contributed for many years to
the fund through the general taxation, could
apply for his pension as a matter of right
instead of asking assistance on all-fours as a
case of charity. The element of Bumble-ism
would be left out altogether. In place of
being a pauper, he would be a perfectly
independent citizen—as independent as the
one who goes to his insurance office to col-
lect Ins endowment policy when it falls due.
His children, if he had any, would not be the
children of a pauper. No officious charitable
person would have any right to inter-
rogate him about his soul, or invade his
home and insist on reading dismal tracts to
him, or to make rules and regulations for his
conduct, or to insist on him wearing any
livery. And if the system made
4UUU less paupers in a comparatively small
community it would'do a great deal towards
making that community vigorous and indepen-
dent, and one whose existence would be cal-
culated to make this world feel better.
* * * *
The project, as it stands, is undoubtedly
incomplete, though probably it is as complete
as can be expected for a beginning. It
makes no allowance for destitute persons
who Ai'e perffiafientiy incapacitated at a com-
paratively early age by accident or otherwise.
Old age, too, has no fixed point of commence-
ment ; some people are worn-out and senile
at 60, and to the decayed individual who is
trying to live long enough to qualify the
period from 60 to 65 is very protracted and
barren and hopeless. There is no possible
way, either, of providing for the patriarch
who has not put in the required 20 years
residence, save by the hap-hazard methods of
public and private charity ; until the pension
system becomes universal it is necessary to
draw a hard and fast line somewhere, else
the country with a pension system would
become burdened with the broken-down
grandparents and great-grandparents of all
nations. Still the scheme provides for the
most necessitous class of the community and
the one for which the country is most dis-
tinctly responsible. And if the provision is
not large it is at least large enough, in a
land of comparative cheapness, to keep
the recipient from absolute want, and
to save him from being a tragedy
while he remains alive and a newspaper
horror by the manner of his death.
Also, there is the possibility—assuming that
the measure becomes law—that the demands
on the pension-fund may prove less than is
expected, and that it may be found possible
to treat the patriarch rather more liberally
than is expected when he calls to collect his
annuity. In any case, the system will not
do evil by creating a useless class, for it deals
only with a class which is practically useless
for industrial purposes already. As the
average pensioner, too, is not likely to hoard
up much out of his 10s. a week, and as he
will not be an absentee, as the high official
pensioner often is, his dole will promptly go
back into circulation again, which will help
in some degree to reduce the burden—not
much of a burden at the worst. And Maori-
and will get some value for it, apart from all
financial considerations, in the load that will
be lifted oil its public conscience and the
extent to which it will feel better in its
dreams.
Some “Public Works.”
L'he best jokes of the public services of the
Australasian provinces are also the great scan-
dals. None but humorists of the brightest
description could achieve such a jest, for in-
stance, as getting Government to pay 4s. 6d.
and ss. 6d. for the excavation as solid rock
from a gigantic railway-cutting, when every
“ bushy ” within a radius of 40 miles from the
place knew that the country was a friable shale
which a child could extract with his toy shovel,
and the removal of which would be well paid
at Is. 3d. per cubic yard.
* * * *
Another joke of the same order occurred dur-
ing the construction of a great main line in
another province. A superior railway official,
of reputedly the highest engineering ability,
tunnelled a mass of the hardest rock, the
Government paying for the work at perhaps
the highest rate ever locally paid for tunnel
excavation. That was laugh the first in the
Joke. Laugh the second came in when the
same official pronounced the tunnel unsafe, and
induced the Ministry of the day to consent to
its being transformed into an open cutting,
which work, by the way, had it been undertaken
in the first instance, would have cost only two-
thirds as much as the tunnelling. Laugh number
three must have shaken the heavens, when the
whole of the open cutting was newly paid for
as though the mass of its cubic contents had
not already been removed, and paid for, at
tunnel rates ! That item of profit means a big
fortune in itself for the contractor.
* * * *
Fortunately for the country, jests upon that
scale cannot be indulged in nowadays, but still
the old class of jokist dies hard. In a small
way, he has his fling still. Towards the end of
the last grew,t building boom in a certain great
Australian city, but before symptoms of the col-
lapse were apparent, enormous importations of
marble mantelpieces were made" by several
down-South city firms. The boom fell in-
thousands of the mantelpieces remained ‘on
hand but there has scarcely been a railway-
porter’s hut, or any rookery of the humblest
kind, since erected by Government, that has
not been enriched by as many marble mantel-
pieces as could be in decency erected in the
structure. And nobody seemingly knows
whence all these marble mantelpieces sprang.
A school-inspector was once politely told to
mind his own business when he protested
against the fitting up of the quarters attached
to every tuppeny-ha’penny school-house with
elegant and valuable chimneypieces.

Official Joe Millerisms of this sort are still
indulged in, even by theN.S.YV. Railway Com-
missioners. The green signal-lamp, for iu-
stance, 6° mdes away from the head-quarters
of the district, had tbe glass broken. It could
have been replaced by an intelligent official at
a local expense of Is. 6d. Power, however, to
carry out so common-sense a proceeding was
denied him by regulation, and what with the
visits of (1) an inspector to report on the
damage done, and the work required; (2) the
journey up of a workman to replace the glass ;
(3) his journey down the next day to bring his*
diamond, which he had forgotten the first time,
and finally another inspector’s trip to investi-
gate and report, the total cash expense to the
country amounted to between £3 and M. So
the joker who cultivates jocularity at the
national expense still survives.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Some Things that are Old.
VKBY fe'v things in this world are wholly new,
ihe Maori land Government, during recent
years, has been making history at a great rate
in the direction of State Socialism, and the
lory press has rained unutterable bosh for
many months about the recklessness of its
“experimental legislation.” And, as the
majority of the population knows practically
nothing itself, and takes its opinions ready-
made from the newspapers, it has been generally
accepted that the legislation is new, and that
no one knows where such reckless experiments
may lead to. Yet almost every one of these
experiments—to say nothing of many others
which are to come—is in full blast somewhere
or other, and was proved feasible and successful
many years ago—so long ago, in some cases,
that it began before the white man first in*
fested Australia. The State ownership of rail*
ways is a very old experiment which has been
tried over all the five continents with good re*
suits.' State life insurance is a British institu-
tion of a good many years standing, and is htil,
though on a diminutive scale, in connection With
the Imperial Post-office. The State Bank
idea is at least 200 years old, and ill the Old
World a dozen or more of such institutions eah
be found, The British Government tuns the
issue of paper-money in India, and the Canadian
Government does likewise in Canada, so that this
much-needed reform has sufficient British pre-
cedent—to say nothing of much other precedent
—to back it. The land-talc has existed in England
for centuries, and was once the principal source
of revenue, and it is by far the largest source
of revenue to-day in India. The purchase by
the Government of big estates to cut up in
small farms and sell on long terms, is a British
idea for the relief of Ireland, and the system
has been at work there for some years. It is
also an old German idea, and was largely
adopted in Prussia. The idea of a State Land
Bank is also old ; Norway has had such a bank
for 40 years past, and the Imperial Bank of
Russia does the same kind of business on an
immense scale. Also, some of the private banks
of Europe are compelled by law to invest a
certain part of their funds in this business at a
very low rate of interest. The State pawnshop
flourishes in Prance and Holland, and in the
latter country the three-ball business is a State
monopoly. The State Drink Monopoly, which is
obviously coming, has its counterpart in the State
Opium Monopoly of British India. The pro-
posed State Tobacco Monopoly is a public enter-
prise which has existed in France for 80 years ;
it also exists in other countries of Continental
Europe. The Old Age Pension system flourishes
in Germany and elsewhere. Except, perhaps,
the State Fire Insurance project, there is not
one of the “reckless Socialistic experiments”
which these provinces are now plunging into
that hasn’t been tried and proved feasible long
ago by slow-going, old-world nations, not on
Socialistic grounds but as matters of hard, com-
monplace finance. Most of these alleged “ex-
periments ” should command the respect of the
lory party merely by reason of their age, but
it is only the bad things that are old which
the genuine Tory loves. The good things that
are old, however old they be, seldom appeal to
him.

Parliamentary Salaries.
The proposal of solicitor Russell Hyphen
Jones, M.L.A., to reduce the salary of N.S. W.
Parliamentary representatives, in the name of
patriotism and disinterestedness, from £3OO to
£l5O a year, is one which should be squashed
hard by every democrat in the community.
The reason advanced for the reduction is mainly
the usual one—that payment was started to
enable the working-man to sit in Parliament
without loss to himself, and that £3 a week is
enough to cover all he loses through exchanging
his saw-mill or his bootmaking machine for
the Legislature. Also, another reason assigned
is the usual sneer that the working-men now in
Parliament couldn’t earn more than .£l5O a year
at boot-making or saw-milling, and if thev
don t care to accept that remuneration there are
plenty more bootmakers and saw'-millers who
will be glad to do so. This superficial
snort doesn’t even begin to express the
situation. The country, even when it sends
a bootmaker to Parliament, wants the
best bootmaker it can fiucl. It requires him to
go and live in the city for a great part of the
year, which, in many cases, means supporting
two establishments—not in the Social Gimlet
sense. It wants him to dress sufficiently well
to keep him from being an object of ridicule in
a top-hatted assembly; this isn’t absolutely
written in the contract, but it gets there all
the same. It recognises the fact that he is
expected to be a sort of charitable institution
for the relief of hungry and stone-broke consti-
tuents and that he has many calls on him which
he hadn’t in his bootmaking days. As a M. L.A.
he has -to be elected at least once every three
years, which is an expensive process; whereas a
mere bootmaker hasn’t to be elected, or to pay
for halls in which to address his constituents,
or to make progresses through his constituency.’
ruither, when lie has learned the business of
politics the country still reserves to itself the
right to take his occupation from him at any
moment; it asks him to give up a billet which
may be permanent for one which is wholly pre-
carious. Further, the argument that because a
man was a bootmaker before he became a poli-
tician he should only be paid bootmaker’s
wages is wholly illogical; on the same basis,
because Premier Reid was a civil servant
at a few pounds a week before he was a
Premier, therefore he should get only a few
pounds a week now. Also, if an M.L.A. should
only get £l5O a year because he couldn’t earn
more at shearing or some other occupation, it is
equally evident that solicitor Jones should con-
duct a big lawsuit for 255. because lie couldn’t
make more in the tinfe at shovelling mud
When solicitor Jones demands an all-round
reduction of Parliamentary salaries, he isn’t
necessarily so disinterested as he looks. He is
a resident of Sydney, so his own political posi-
tion involves none of the expenses incurred by
country members. To be M.L.A., regarded
as an advt. for his law-practice, should be worth
to him at least £6OO a year. By reducing Par-
liamentary salaries he reduces competition for
seats in the Assembly, and thereby makes the
billet, and the advt., and the £6OO a year or
whatever it is that the advt. is worth, so much
the more secure. Altogether it is just possible
that it would pay solicitor Jones and his kind
a great deal better to have no salaries at all
and so reduce competition to a minimum and
make the billet and the business it brings’ with


it practically permanent. Moreover, as Jones
undertook to give all his Parliamentary salary
to local charities —which probably helped his
election materially—he doesn’t lose a penny
even if the salary is reduced to nothing.
The Federal Capital.
Melbourne Table Talk remarks in an aston-
ished tone of voice as follows :
J. G. Drake, of Queensland, seriously takes up The
Bulletin idea of an inland Federal State, after the manner
of the district of Columbia in the United States, for the
Federal capital. He suggests 50,000 square miles at the
point where the borders of New South Wales, South Aus-
tralia, and Queensland now meet.
The Melbourne paper is seemingly surprised
that Drake didn’t take the matter up in a
more airy and frivolous spirit. Yet it certainly
is a question to be taken up seriously, if there
is any serious question in politics just now.
There are at least five good reasons why none
of the existing capitals should be chosen for the
Federal city. (1) Interprovincial jealousies
stand in the way ; it is impossible to select the
capital of one province without making the
others cool off greatly on the question of unity.
(2) None of the existing capitals is reasonably
central. (3) They are all within convenient
reach of invasion ; a sudden and well-planned
raid by an enemy might easily make the Federal
Government and . the military head-quarters
run for the bush, and rush the Federal Treasury,
and capture the Federal arsenals, and scare the
whole show into the mountains, just when it
was most needed. (4) They are all on the
coast, where the population is too much con-
centrated already. (5) There are difficulties
and anomalies about having the Federal and
local government in one city. Yet neither
New South Wales nor Victoria would be willing
to constitute its capital and the immediate sur-
roundings a Federal district, and thereby lose
half its population, and become a mere second
or third-rate province. And there are at least
eight good reasons for building the Federal
capital in the farthest interior—say in
the M'Donnell ranges of South Australia,
which is probably the most promising
site yet suggested. (1) It is almost the
exact centre of Australia, and when the rail-
way systems are completed this site would be
more accessible from all parts of the country
than any other. (2) It would place the Federal
Government, treasury, arsenals, ammunition
factories, military department, and probably
the head-quarters of the banks, which would,
most likely, move there in course of time,
beyond the reach of invasion and sudden loot.
(3) It would offer a chance for the biggest and
grandest experiment in Land Nationalisation
attempted in modern times. The Federal
Government could acquire that stretch of
wilderness at its prairie value, which is almost
nil, and be the ground landlord of the Federal
city and its surroundings for fiver, and realise
a handsome income thereby. (4) It would
draw population to the interior where it is
most wanted; not to the coast where it is
wanted least. No other scheme would “ open
up the interior,” as the threadbare phrase goes,
half so quickly or effectively. (5) The building
of the new city would afford a vast amount of
employment, while the land-values it would
create would do a great deal towards paying
the cost. (6) The gathering of population on
ihe new site would make it possible to finish
the S.A. transcontinental railway as a paying
spec, and it would also make it profitable and
feasible to extend the Central Queensland line
westward to the new capital, which would mean
more opening up of the interior and more em-
ployment. (The only reasons why Adelaide
and Port Darwin and Rockhampton don’t lift
up their voices unanimously in favor of the
project is that they haven’t fully realised
the advantages they would individually
derive from it). (7) It would definitely
secure the Northern Territory as part of
Australia (the only excuse for not handing it over
being that this country has so far failed to settle
it with population and “ open it up ”), whereas
the Territory is now British property, and
liable, if the British Government pleases, to be
jobbed away to black-labor syndicates. In
other words, this scheme would help to make a
United Australia, whereas now there is an ugly
weak spot in the scheme of unity. (8) The
proposed site is a plateau some 2000 ft. high,
with a beautiful climate, and is the best-watered
part of the far interior. And for these reasons
all single-taxers, latid-nationalisers, land and
other boomers, jerry-builders, patriots, pick-
and-shovel men, railway-contractors, and un-
employed, also all Hergott Springs, Oodnadatta
and Boulia, and their joint and several dogs,
should howl for this project; and all provin-
cialists who don’t want the rival capital to
become the seat of Government should do like-
wise ; and Adelaide, Port Darwin, and Rock-
hampton should howl loudest of all, for they
would be the nearest and most accessible ports,
and the trade of the Federal capital should
make them boom exceedingly. The Bulletin
has said all this before, but it is necessary to
keep saying the same thing over and over again
with dreadful iteration to make it soak into the
public comprehension.
Abusing tbe Law.
Once again the hopeless case of Widow Kil-
patrick v. Huddart Parker and Co. has come
into the Melb. Law Courts, and this time a
Judge was good enough to voice public opinion
on the matter. Widow K. —it is a time-worn
story—sued H.P. and Co. for the loss of her
husband in the steamship Alert. A jury gave
her <£6oo damages, whereupon defendants pro-
cured a new trial. This resulted in a verdict
of <£79l, and defendants appealed for a third
trial on certain grounds, which were referred,
us before, to the Full Court. Five Judges con-
stituted the Full Court when the second appeal
came along, and by a majority of 3 to 2 their
Honors upheld the second trial. Also, Justice
Williams made the following pertinent re-
marks :
“ There had already been two trials of this case, both of
which resulted in a verdict for plaintiff, and if the Full
Court on the first occasion had taken the same view of
the certificate's as the majority of the Court did now, no
new trial would have been granted. He might point his
observation by a short reference to the recent case of
Edwards v. the Metropolitan Board of Works. That case
was tried four times. On the first trial the jury dis-
agreed ; on the other three each jury gave plaintiff a ver-
diet with damages, which were necessarily small.
Defendants tried to get a fifth trial, hut the Court refused
the application, and plaintiff retained a verdict. He
(Justice Williams) might safely assume that after four
such trials the plaintiff who, like the present plaintiff,
was of small means, would not improbably find himself
ruined by his long struggle to secure what the Full Court
had at length held to be his due.”
Widow Kilpatrick, it goes without say-
ing, is now quite at the mercy of her
lawyers. Her costs, no doubt, far ex-
ceed the costs allowed to her, and her
damages, if she ever gets them, will not
suffice to pay the legal expenses charge-
able to her account. Meantime, Huddart
Parker and Co. have obtained leave to appeal
to the Privy Council, and the case resumes
business for an indefinite period. The
injustice to widow Kilpatrick lies in the
fact that the law has been purposely made
for lawyers and not for the public. There
is little or no finality about its rulings, this
side of the Privy Council, provided that
either litigant has the wealth and inclina-
tion to purchase appeals. Even a Full Court
is a ghastly fraud which may be set aside
by a Fuller Court. The great purpose of the
law is to create costs, and it misses no reason-
able chance of gaining its mercenary end. The
moral of the Kilpatrick case, and the Edwards
case aforesaid, was shamelessly admitted by a
barrister in a Melbourne suburban police-
court on the same day that Judge
Williams spoke his mind. The barrister in
question was summoned for payment of a
grocery-bill, and the grocer obtained an order
for the amount and costs, in weekly instal-
ments. Did the defeated one accept the law
served out to him ? No ;he glared defiantly at
the Bench, and said : “I shall appeal against
the order, and it will cost the defendants more
than the debt is worth.” There we have a
frank confession that the Law in the hands of
one of its professors is a bludgeon for smiting
the grocer who demands justice.
Doggerel - Drunken.
Doesn’t Mr. Jawbone-NEiLD’s revived trouble
with his critics arise from the not-sufficiently-
noted fact that the literary calling—dealing
fundamentally with the expression of ideas—
differs from every other in that it can be fol-
lowed, in some sort, by almost anybody who
can read and write ? The workers in all sorts
of other vocations who inundate editors with
hopeless rubbish are doing precisely the same
thing, in kind, as the most accomplished man
of letters whose work is eagerly accepted at a
fancy figure. The separating gulf, enormous
though it be, is nevertheless only a chasm of
degree, and it is just the fatal inability to
appreciate degree—the total lack, in fact,
of a chief essential to any effective literary
equipment—that produces the mighty swarm of
people who can’t write, and don’t know it !
and who stand, therefore, upon even a lower
literary level than those who can’t write and do
know it ! Mostly, also, it is the man who
can’t-write-and-doesn’t-know-it who is the
readiest to charge either inadequacy or dis-
honesty upon all criticism of his work that is
not at least commendatory. More especially is
this true of the doggerelist, w'ho is so cheer-
fully ready to label his futilities “ poetry ”
—a designation never arrogated by any
writer who, though capable of “ perfect
thoughts in perfect numbers,” is also cap-
able, ipso facto , of understanding that verse
—however excellent as verse—has no necessary
connection w'ith poetry. Dickens, for instance,
is, here and there, as poetic in his prose as he is
prosy in his “poetry.” The more, too, a man
has in him, the more likely he will be to suspect
that for a consensus of unfavorable criticism
there must be some justification in his work.
But, w'ith the literary tyro—and still more with
the absolute poetic incapable—there are only
two possible explanations of the fact that he
has been unanimously so classified by those
whose opinions in such matters are commer-
cially considered worth paying for and printing.
Either—in spite of this recognised professional
status —the critics simply don’t know what
they’re talking about; or—in spite of the
fact that the criticised’s literary fate is
probably a matter of the profoundest
indifference to everybody but himself—they
have malignantly conspired to stigmatise pub-
licly as balderdash those exercitations which
they privately agree with the perpetrator
thereof in falling down to adore. And the
Warrior-Bard of Woollahra —reverently pro-
strate before his own poetic shrine—presents a
gorgeous example of what may happen to the
cobbler who gets so foolishly far away from the
commonplace little last for which Nature
obviously intended him.
The Scope for Law Reform.
Editor Bulletin.—The Victorian Mines Act
affords three splendid illustrations of the way
in which young countries may set to work to
successfully sweep away old-world cobwebs.
The cruel provision of English law, engendered
nobody knows how, by which an employer is
not responsible for injuries to an if
said injuries have been caused by the negli-
gence of a fellow-employ 6, has been swept
away, as far as miners are concerned, by one
simple and effective section. The doctrine that
he who uses it is alone entitled to occupy land
is given effect to in the provisions relating to
miners’ rights and labor conditions. All the
feudal notions, attached still, to our disgrace, to
agricultural land, have been found unnecessary
in this kind of property, and the working of
the clauses certainly suggests their extension to
all kinds of real property as a feasible means of
solving many agrarian problems. Indeed, we
can hope sincerely to hear of a “farmers’
rights ” movement in the near future. And
lastly, the procedural provisions of the Court
of Mines have in one section amalgamated
law and equity quite as effectually as all
the elaborate judicature provisions have
in other branches of the law, and they did it
before the Judicature Act was heard of. These
facts should waken democrats to the conscious-
ness that it is foolish to await England’s lead
before initiating reforms. What the sturdy,
commonsense miners of the fifties, assisted bj
the luminous intellect of Mr. Justice Moles
worth, could do in a sphere of law w'mre prece
dents could give no help, surely the more care
fully-trained democrats of our own day can do
in other spheres with very little outside assist-
ance. Why do not some of our single-minded
and earnest young democrats band together for
the purpose of evolving a system of law, land
tenure, &c., suited to our circumstances, and
freed from feudal and aristocratic jargon ? For
instance, as a start, the question of inheritance,
the credit system, free justice, the limitation of
liability in contracts couched in highly techni-
cal terms not understood by one of the parties,
the law of evidence, and the marital relation,
would equip a probably highly - productive
symposium of democratic enthusiasts. Politi-
cal leaders cannot be trusted in these matters,
for private law, so often fraught with more far-
reaching consequences than public law, requires
hard study and does not pan out in much
momentary applause. We must evolve it our-
selves, and until we do so will not have proved
ourselves quite worthy of the freedom we
happen, at present, to enjoy.— Danton.
The success of the plea advanced by Minister
Gould for the retention of capital punish-
ment for rape drove several opponents of capi-
tal punishment to vote for its retention for
murder, when the Alerfd Stephen Criminal
Code first came before N.S.W. Parliament.
The deceased Pa rices, who was opposed to
capital punishment on principle and voted
against its employment for rape, voted for it
afterwards for the crime of murder, on the
ground that as the House had made the former
crime capital, it was bound to make murder
capital, or the perpetrator would add murder
to his other offence. And many followed
Parkes in that view, so that the
opponents of capital punishment for mur-
der looked fewer than at the time they
really were. Gould’s plea must, therefore, be
fully met, or the division-list, whenever the
question comes to a division, will show in favor
of capital punishment those who oppose it on
priiifciple, but who will vote for it for murder
because a majority will have previously carried
it for rape. The N.S.W. law on this subject,
as it now stands, is merely a law for the En-
couragement of Murder. The man who has
committed rape, knowing that he will forfeit
his life if convicted, will, on the principles that
one may as well be hanged for a sheep as a
lamb and that dead women tell no tales, kill
the victim whom he has outraged.
Murray Smith, instructing Melbourne Reform
Club in the Political Obligations of Citizenship,
made it quite clear that he doesn’t sin through
ignorance. “ W r hat are the obligations and
dangers of the citizen ?” asked the respectable
old Tory of his professional and commercial
friends in front. They, for the most part, hold
hideously incorrect ideas on the point, but
Murray Smith gave them the platitudes of
truth to learn, mark, and inwardly—despise :
His first obligation is energy, and his first danger
apathy, which, unfortunately, is too common. This is
specially true of those classes which are most interested
in sound government, and at whose expense the political
game is played. Mismanagement, wasteful extravagance,
public corruption, crude and ill-considered legislation,
though ultimately they fall with crushing weight upon
the poor, attack primarily the great body of industrious,
peaceful men, whose only desire is to obtain a fair reward
for their industry. . . To this class we should look for
enlightened criticism and constant watchfulness.
The Bulletin approves heartily the remarks
of Murray Smith. A great weight of public
corruption has descended upon the poor citizens
of Victoria with a'sickening thud, and a number
of industrious, peaceful persons were attacked
primarily by the same shameful tiling. And in the
face of this undoubted fact The Bulletin would
like to kneel, in a metaphorical sense, upon
Murray Smith’s chest and force him to admit
that he has never once publicly wagged his
tongue against the corrupt crowd of covetous
conspirators who are mainly responsible for
Smellburst’s present stink. The apathy of
himself and his loquacious likes—men who talk
themselves into Parliament and are afraid to
condemn gilded rascality when they get there —
is the origin of scandals, and the germ of the
blight that eats into the fruit of industry.
When did the personally-honest Murray Smith
fire off enlightened criticism at the pestilential
boomsters, and how much has his watchfulness
been worth to Victoria, presuming that he
keeps his eyes fixed on the corruption of public
life ? He doesn’t even hold a handkerchief to
his political nose. If his constituents have
brains enough to comprehend the meaning "of
his Reform Club address they will fulfil their
first obligation to the State by getting rid of
Murray Smith at next election. On his own
showing, he is a dangerous character who ought
to be left to wither at the bottom of the poll.
A Bill has been introduced into Vic. Parlia-
ment to secure insurance policies against rapa-
cious creditors. It has been urgently needed,
for, although a provision already exists protect-
ing them, it has been so cut down by legal
quibbling as to be rather a trap than an aid.
The courts, for instance, have been showing
serious signs of holding that the effect of the
said provision is nullified if a man allows the
usual clause referring to payment of all his
“ just debts ”to remain in his will. Everybody
almost, except when advised, puts this in, often
from a sort of wish to curry favor on the other
side of Styx, but certainly in very few cases
with the intention of pauperising his wife and
children. The new Act aims at obviating this
danger, and also provides that in the case of
insolvency the policy to the extent of £lOOO
shall escape the creditors. The definition of
“ insolvency ” includes liquidation and cotnpo
sition, the fat-man’s paths, but does not include
assignment for benefit of creditors, which is
the ordinary mode of insolvency in the case of
poor and honest tradespeople. This is a serious
omission, which existed before, and, as it has
been taken advantage of by remorseless credi-
tors, ought at once to be remedied.
The City of Melbourne Bank prosecution will
attract some more notice to the weakness of
counsel appearing for the Vic. Crown in cases
where the country’s credit is concerned.
Purves, Q.C., Dufey, Coldiiam, Maxwell,
and Mitchell will fight for one or other of the
lefendants, and against this formidable array
jf legal talent, bluff and trickery, the Crown
pits Finlayson and Johnstone. The Vic-
torian public must be growing weary of
Finlayson, whose particular forte is gentle-
manly forbearance ; and, anyway, the
public would like to know why Attorney-
General Isaacs doesn’t appear in court for his
own department, as a British Attor.-Cen.
would under similar circumstances. Isaacs of
yore protested against the nolle prosequi of his
superior officer, Bryan O’Logiilen, in the
Great Davies Scandal, and now is the young
man’s chance to prove himself a real champion
of fair play. Let him give the Crown a chance
to obtain a thorough trial by taking a hand in
it himself.
A characteristic sample of Premier Reid on
the blessings of Free-raid :
I am happy to say I can give this committee one of the
most Convincing tests in the world of the difference
between buying in a colonial Freetrade market and buy-
ing in a colonial Protectionist market. As this committee
knows, the Government of N.S. Wales take large con-
tracts every year for supplies for the public service. Our
superintendent of stores went down to Melbourne two or
three months ago, and he took the Government contracts
for this year in Victoria and our contracts, and the prices
in both.' He took out lines identical in quality, number-
ing 121 lines, of which I have a list. The prices were
taken out to Id. According to the prices which the Vic-
torian people pay on the Victorian articles, these would
cost us £21,069 for the year’s supply. This is according
to Melbourne prices. Yet the Sydney contractors’ prices
for the same articles for which Victoria pays £21,069 are
£10,400. That is a little bit of cold iron for my friends to
chew.
There are just eleven things wanted to make
this statement complete. It doesn’t say
whether the New South Wales contracts
referred to the first part of the financial year
under Protection or the second part under
partial Freetrade; or whether the goods in
question were protected in either province ; or
what goods they were ; or why figures were
not given for all the Government contracts,
amounting to some .£500,000 a year, instead of
for only one-fiftieth of them. It omits to men-
tion whether there were any other lines in
which the figures were the other way about;
or which province comes out cheaper on the
whole ; or what is the good of quoting 121
articles of such utter unimportance that the
province only uses £B9 worth of each article
per annum ; or where the list is to be seen ; or
who guarantees its accuracy ; or what evidence
there is, in the absence of publication, that there
is any such list at all. Otherwise it is a good,
useful-looking piece of evidence.

Professor C. A. Wood, 8.A., lecturing to the
Sydney “ Young Men Christians,” on “ The
War of American Independence ; its Place in
the History of the English People,” is reported
by Sydney D.T. as having “ failed to see” why
Americans keep up the 4th of July, and why
they “rejoice in their disunion with the
British.”
Instead of their rejoicing in the fact that they lived
under separate flags, they should rather lament it. . . .
He hoped that Americans would regard the anniversary
of the declaration of American Independence not as a day
of rejoicing, but as a day of humiliation.
Professor Wood hopes for the solid possession
of the moon’s reflection in a pail of water. Mr.
Wood fails to see why the descendants of men
whose fathers were first spewed out of England,
and then bullied at a distance and enslaved by
England, should rejoice about the day that gave
them the freedom of manhood and self-master-
doin ! Mr. Wood is of that sample of last-
century Englishman wffio thought he and his
kind alone had a right to own, to’ buy, to sell,
and to whop niggers ; and who could not under-
stand why a nigger should celebrate the day
that he became his own chattel.

It is thus made evident, for the thousandth
time, that there is one law for broadcloth and
another for moleskin. This paper holds that
being hawked through the public thorough-
fares in convict-garb is no part of a prisoner’s
sentence, but is an indignity to which (as tend-
ing to destroy the last rags of a man’s self-
respect) no criminal should be subjected ; yet
there is room for emphatic protest against the
disgraceful maladministration which sends the
uninfluential to gaol in leg-irons and broad-
arrows, while allowing the other sort to weai
on the way tailor-made suits and other appur
tenances of free and prosperous citizens.
Minister Cook’s Local Option Bill, now almost
ready for submission to N.S.W. Parliament,
may be termed a Bill to make every day Sunday
The present Sunday liquor-law is as drastic at
pure Local Option can hope to make its own
measure, and what is the consequence? Twenty -
three out of every twenty-five public-houses in
the land sell on Sundays, and break the law.
Can Local Option shut up pubs, more effectually
than tlffiy are now shut on Sundays ? If so, vt it li
what machinery ? And if it shut up certain
places called pubs., how will it reach the vendors
of ginger-wine who understand the meaning of
a wink ? And if Local Option go the length of
prohibition, will not private stills go to work in
lanes and backyards ? Where Sunday-selling
cannot be suppressed with all the law at com-
mand, what hope is there that Local Option can
do better? Reid and Want are credited with
knowing what a mistake it is to put too much
water in their whisky. To allow too much of
the watery part of their Ministry to go into the
business of Parliament is the same mistake in a
bigger affair.
Me lb. and Alfred Hospitals are querulous about
a new move of the Turner Govt, in distributing
the charitable vote—viz., the inclusion of a
clause that nurses shall not be worked more
than 168 hours in three weeks, eight hours a
day including Sundays. The hospitals work it
out that so many hundreds per annum will have
to be added to the salary-list, and so many
thousands spent for additional quarters—and
that is reckoned to be an excellent argument in
favor of sweating nurses. Rapiport was a
member of Melb. Hospital committee, and
his resignation was accepted with demur—
which shows what a nice chance nurses have.
Charity and sweating should not be combined,
and the Turner Govt, is to be commended for
trying to make Charity just before she is
generous.

Her Majesty’s has closed this week for re-
pairs, and this reduces Sydney to‘'three theatres
altogether. The last act, for the present at least,
in tne career of the big, luckless show-house was
Alf. Woods’ benefit, which took place with much
enthusiasm and a considerable amount of success
on Monday afternoon. It was of the usual in-
sanely scrappy order, and consisted of a little bit
of everything by everybody. A committee of 200
allegedly influential citizens tackled the social
aspect of the job, and 100 people in all took a
hand upon the stage. They included Her Majesty’s
and the Tivoli companies, the Tank, a lot of un-
attached dramatic talent, and most of the musical
ability of Sydney. The show was supported by
Premier Reid and his concealed deficit, the God-
fearing Ministry, a contingent from both Houses
of Parliament, the Mayor, and a lot of the kind of
people who have initials trailing behind them in
great quantities. The last act of the last bill put
up on the last day of the Woods-Marshall regime
was that respected farce, “ His Last Legs.” Pos-
sibly this was meant as an unkind allusion to
something or somebody; anyhow, Woods ought
certainly to have appeared in kilts just here and
returned thanks.

Hoyt’s frivolous musical trifle, at the
Lyceum, shows no change save that business is, if
possible, a little more tremendous than it was
last week, the management’s chief trouble being to
avoid prosecution for overcrowding and premedi-
tated suffocation. The “ Trip to Chinatown ”
so-called because nobody goes there—is now doing
its third week, and, on present appearances, it
should be able to run just about as long as the
Firm pleases. Up to date, this giddy nothing,
principally suggestive of a bunch of feathers in a
nurry, is said to be financially the most successful
W. and M. enterprise since the first Gaiety co.
* * * -*
It is definitely announced that the “ Derby
Winner ” will end its long career at Sydney Royal
to-morrow (Friday), and “ A Woman’s Revenge ”
follows on Saturday. Bland Holt is apparently
making a bigger pot of money this season than on
any previous visit to Sydney, and he proposes to
take the tide at the flood, in a manner of speaking,
and seize the cow’s husband by the horns, so to
speak, and put up another big spectacle before the
old one has worn out its welcome.
** * *
Now that Brough and Boucicault, whose
forte was the newest kind of giddy funnyism,
have left Sydney Criterion, Parson Haskett
Smith, who lectures on the oldest and most
mouldersome of ruins, and tells tales of dusty
catacombs, has seen fit to take over that house for
a series of entertainments. The rev. gentleman’s
show runs till to-morrow (Friday) night, unless he
decides to extend it and explain some more ruins ;
and The Bulletin cordially recommends every-
body to hear him at least once before he goes, and
thereby gain an idea of how very small a quantity
of dust he will make when he is dead. The Rev.
Smith is now delving into the shadowy wastes of
old Thebes and Memjihis and Babylon, and he
seems to know’every stone of fhese cities by
heart, and when he rebuilds them lovingly out of
his stores of remote knowledge they become so
real that the boomer almost resolves for a moment
to open a bank there immediately and issue inter-
minable inscribed stock at 4 per cent. No
one that The Bulletin has yet met can ex-
tract so much interest out of the dust and
ashes of old-time cities as Haskett Smith does.
The long immensity of the years when he unrolls
them makes Jawbone Neild, as he shrieks over his
poems, look like something |-inch high clamoring
at an atom, and the great aggregate footballer of
the period seem like an ant kicking a speck upon
a leaf, and makes his audience dream of the time
(a.d. 116,329) when people will look back and
think, in the shortening of the perspective of
things, that Victoria was right up against Noah’s
Deluge, and that Parkes and Lot were boys
together. The Bulletin loves Haskett Smith in
a dreamy, unworldly sort of way, and when it has
listened to him for an hour or so it begins to feel
that it really doesn’t matter whether the next
issue comes out on Thursday or not. The past is
such a long' eternity of dust, and the present is
fast becoming dust also, and the dust will look
just the same on the shovel whether anything
comes out or not.

William Crackles is now at the zenith of
his career at Sydney Tivoli, and Charles Godfrey
has still two weeks to run. With the Cri. and Her
Majesty’s both temporarily out of the business,
and the Gaiety, Standard, Opera House, and the
forgotten Alhambra all mouldering in permanent
dust and desolation, and the School of Arts hall
turned into a library, competition is at a very low
ebb in Sydney just now, so the three managers
who are still alive are having a period of glittering
prosperity. The Tivoli is too small for the busi-
ness that comes its way nowadays, and the pro-
spect of Harry Rickards slopping over into the
Town Hall seems imminent.
* * *■
That oldest of living musicians, the won-
drous Chevalier de Kontski, opens at Sydney
Centenary Hall on July 23. The well-known
Hugo Fischer is managing for the Chevalier.
The present double-bill at Melbourne
Princess’s seems a quick and vigorous entertain-
ment after the long French tragedies of previous
weeks. “ Cavalleria Rusticana,” in its original
dramatic form, is a crisp little story, practically
the same thing as the opera libretto, with a suit-
able orchestral accompaniment of Mascagni’s
music to help it along. The stage setting and
business management are even more effective on
the whole than in the opera, especially as regards
the mortal combat between the cuckold teamster
and the co-respondent, which is now fought out
with 18-inch blades fti the centre of a howling
mob. On the other hand, the curtain tableau was
stronger in the opera, where giddy Lola’s concern
for her husband’s safety (the other fellow
being killed) was reserved for a finishing
touch. The moral that a live husband is
better than a dead sweetheart is not enforced in
the drama. Bellew represents Turridor, the
soldier, as a less callous betrayer of his girl than
the operatic Turiddu, and Mrs. Potter is a more
crushed Santuzza than Signora Del Torre created
for us. She is charming enough in her lighter
phases of sorrow. But when a loud expression of
feeling is required Mrs. Potter becomes again the
artificial actress, struggling under a load of his-
trionic responsibility which she has not been born
or educated to carry. Scot Inglis is an interest-
ing, well-spoken teamster in a new velvet suit;
whilst poor, very poor, performances of Lola and
mamma Nunzia are given by Miss Raymond and
Mrs. Hill.
* * * *
“David Garrick” forms a cheerful con-
trast to “ Cavallieria,” also it has two chief parts
to fit the picturesque visitors. Mrs. Potter is a
pretty suggestion of a romantic girl dazzled by an
actor, and Bellew is the theatrical style of actor
who drives that sort of damsel crazy. To the
present writer’s thinking, there is very little
sincerity in the Garrick of Mr. Bellew. He doesn’t
assume drunkenness as though he meant it to be
taken seriously, or seem genuinely pained by
the thought that his hollow device is imposing on
Mrs. Potter. He appears to play at playing a
part, and at those times when his alleged love for
the lady is supposed to break through his promise
to her father, he is the stagiest of lady-killers.
One minute he pretends that he is trying to
cure his host’s daughter of her infatuation,
the next minute he employs all the tricks
of his trade to infatuate her some more. Garrick
in the drunken scene doesn’t carry out the real
meaning of the text, nevertheless he achieves an
attractive counterfeit, which is exactly what every
Bellew would do under the circumstances. His
elegant appearance is a banquet for the ravished
eye throughout. Probably no man off the stage
could become intoxicated to such advantage, and
reel with so much easy grace. Bellew is The
Bulletin’s idea of an archangel on the burst.
James Cathcart plays the old father in his best
old-fashioned method, and small character-parts
are made largely humorous by Miss Polly Emery
and Oily Peering.

The Cosgrove-Luella management started
at Melbourne Bijou with a crowded house, and a
furious rush of flowery tokens, on Saturday.
“Fun on the Bristol,” controlled by Cos-
grove instead of J. F. Sheridan, is neither as gay
as it used to be, nor as sad as many another
comedian might make it. Cosgrove follows his
model closely in some places, and in other places
his model leaves him yards behind. Likewise,
there are occasional points where he diverges from
Sheridan, but gets there all the same. Altogether,
Cosgrove’s performance of Widow O’Brien is a
genial piece of mumming, free from unpleasant
suggestion of a he-male in skirts, and full of
novelty for any person who hasn’t seen the char-
acter played by the original widow. The
rest of the show comprises John Forde,
W. J. Montgomery, and numerous musical items.
These latter are mostly sentimental and over-
anxious to accept an encore, but the voice of Miss
Marie Luella, clad in superb tights, and the
blackened warble of Miss Katie Towers, make
exceptions to the rule. Miss Luella in skirts, dis-
guised as Dora M‘Allister, seems to be at odds
with fortune and eager for the fray. “Fun on
the Bristol ” may do very well, or otherwise, at
the Bijou. Meanwhile, “ The New Housemaid ”
is an active preparation for an emergency.
** * *
Nothing has happened to damp the ardor
of the “Trilby Burlesque” boom at Melbourne
Royal. The tail end of the multitude still gets its
money refused at the doors, and venerable George
Coppin, who has an interest in the show, looks
more than ever like a public benefactor. “ Trilby ”
gathers humor as it rolls along. Svengali’s heart-
disease begins to seize him when least expected,
also that famous musician gets “tanked” with a
nightly increasing success, and his wild header
into the bowels of the piano has added a cubit to
its popularity. Gecko, too, improves on acquaint-
ance, whilst Maggie Moore remains exactly the
same invaluable asset that she was at the beginning
and evermore will be. “Trilby,” however, must
leave the Royal presently, with bright prospects
of striking Sydney at the psychological moment.
** * *
The dancing Durhams are the latest new
feature at the Opera House, where Tennyson and
O’Gorman clearly make themselves out smarter
than the previous individuals who had annexed
their style of conversation. The last nights of
the Frantz Family reveal fresh marvels in the per-
formance of this splendid acrobatic assortment,
and, as far as one can imagine, the seven Frantzs
have left nothing that is humanly possible to be
done by any similar artists present or future.
The Czar, it is cabled, has elected to
become boss publican of his wide dominions.
His last hope of coercing or cajoling the Nihilists,
who will hesitate to cut off their drink-supply at
the fountain head, as it were.
At Poverty Point .
A Brisbane critio to Tub Bulletin : —“ The performance
of the dramatised version of ‘ Trilby ’ is rather un-
natural in many points. In the first place, the strenuous
efforts which Miss Crane makes to prevent the audience
seeing more than three inches above her ankles are alto-
gether inconsistent with the character of the girl who is
in the habit of i osing for ‘ the altogether ’ to a roomful of
students. Again, in Svengali’s death-scene, although the
three knights of the brush and Zou-Zou, Dodo, and
Gecko can see that the oily Hebrew is in a pretty bad way
—sick unto death, in fact —not one of them thinks of pick-
ing him up when he is falling against the scenery, or send-
ing for a doctor. On the contrary, they all stand round
and hurl execrations on the Jew’s greasy head, and the
large-hearted Taffy takes advantage of his weakness to
seize him by the throat and violently assault him, thereby
hastening his end—a performance for which Taffy would
be legally held guilty of manslaughter at the very least.
And, after they have practically killed him off among
them, they let him lie in an uncomfortable position across
a table for about five minutes until the curtain falls.
Then the ‘ rag’ is again raised, with Svengali in the same
position, to show the audience, no doubt, that the neglect
of the ‘ Englanders’ was not an oversight on their part.”
Another Brisbane critic : “ Svengali told us he was
dying of heart disease or angina pectoris, or words to that
effect, and then acted to us that he was dying of tetanus
or strychnia poisoning. Also, Miss O’Ferrall taught us
that there is something new under the sun, to wit, a
patient recovering from brain trouble is seized with pul-
monary symptoms i! she walks about.”
Dear Bulletin, —“Camille’’and “LaTosca” are more
like living-skeleton shows than anything else except a
Rontgen X-ray exhibit. Bones are clearly visible “a-
wobblin’ like a basketful of snakes ” under the skin of
the fascinating Mrs. B.P. Bones are not pretty things
in the living subject, at all events. Mrs. Potter makes
painful and obvious efforts to avoid the commonplace.
But, unfortunately, all the great things in life are common-
place. I saw Duse, in London, open a door and walk into
a room ; she didn’t strut, or stagger, or lurch, or swagger,
or stride, or mince, or trip, or skip, she simply walked on
the stage. Quite an ordinary and everyday action. Yet
the whole audience gave a gasp, and, after the play, I
went home feeling like the last lines of Wordsworth’s
sonnet on Toussaint L’Ouverture. J.C.W. has been often
asked lately when he means to lure Duse here for a spell.
Is there a chance ? —F.
How shocked Australian ’assiety would be, writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent, could it but see the
once much-gushed-over footlight darling in his latest
“ part,” the Pet of Piccadilly. The sad, suffering-a-
recovery look in those eyes now slaughters the Piccadilly
“pusslets” as formerly the dames and daughters of Potts
Point and Toorakia. The mistress or the maid, the
baroness or the ballet-girl, all are the same to this rakish
thespian.
Actor George Leitch is camped with a party of pros-
pectors on a lonesome island in Bass Straits, and, it is
feared, is perpetrating a novel. Some say it is a drama,
to be entitled “The Island of the Mutton Bird.”
The stage-stricken son of a one-time Melb. turf-celebrity,
writes a London correspondent to Tiie Bulletin, carries
his love for the “ purfesh ” to the extent of wearing his
facial make-up both day and night. Ugh !
Maggie Moore is much beloved of the Chow kiddies of
Lilly Boulke-stleet, who invariably accumulate round the
stage-door when Maggie holds the stage. When George
Rignold is lessee, the little Chowkins hide themselves
under the beds and up the spout at home and hibernate
till Maggie returns.
Wfat price “The Comedy of Errors” with Scot Inglis
and Harry Roberts as the Antipholi, and Edwin Kelly and
his son, Edwin Lester, as the two Dromios? They could
become as facially and physically alike as ever did Hos-
kins and Kennedy and the two Holloways.
Ada Crossley writes by last mail to a Sydney friend.
She had just returned from the great Cardiff festival,
where she achieved a great success (as per a huge bundle
of leading-paper notices), and for her “ O Rest in the
Lord” got, says the London Daily News, “a perfect
storm of applause.” The Magazine of Music, writing of
the Patti concert at Bournemouth, says that Miss Cross-
ley’s “ beautiful contralto voice and perfect style make
her a favorite wherever she goes.” She is well booked to
the middle of next year (including many oratorio engage-
ments), and expects to go to Switzerland in Sept, for rest.
Now comes a cable that she has sung before and been
greatly complimented by the Princess and Princesses of
Wales.
Poor Kate Yaughan, as the result of her recent benefit,
is coming to Australia accompanied by a nurse.
In America Kyrle BelT.w received many letters from
stage-struck society maidens asking him to play Romeo
to their Juliet. Kyrle invariably replied that his terms
were 500dOls. for each performance, and this generally
extinguished the maidenly enthusiasm. On one occasion,
however, a mature damelet agreed to the terms, and the
curly one was called on to woo the deadly Juliet. He
says now the agony of that performance was underpaid
at £lOO.
The unappreciated Arthur Jilwood, whom Boucicault
brought out last year, gets plenty of butter for his
wounded feelings from the London critics. Clement
Scott says: “Mr. Arthur Ehvood takes up Lord Jura
again and plays it far better than ever. His voyage to
Australia has been of immense advantage to him. The
same beautiful voice is there ; the same persuasive charm ;
but Jura has never before so enlisted our sympathies, for
he is a rarity in these days—a tender-hearted man. The
death-scene of Jura seemed to us beautiful.”
Elwood’s style was certainly suited to t,he delineation of a
calm passing hence.
“ Old Bigot” writes “ A treasured memory of Kyrle
Bellew. The Bigots’ Club in Dublin was—maybe is still—
a little gathering of journalists, artists, et hoc, who were
not bigoted about anything but liquor, and met every
Thursday night at nine o’clock until three o’clock on
Friday morning. Any distinguished visitor to the city
was made an honorary member during his stay, which
meant that every Thursday night he was expected to eat
stewed oysters, drink Guinness’s stout, and sing, recite,
or tell a new yarn. When Bellew brought along ‘ Romeo
and Juliet’to Michael Gunn’s Gaiety Theatre he called
in after the show on his first Thursday night, and later
got up to recite ‘ The Charge of the Light Brigade.’ It
was grandly done until the third stanza, when he ‘ forgot
his lines.’ One of the bhoys prompted him, and with a
profound bow of dignified gratitude, Bellew proceeded.
An hour or two later, when the crowd was dispersing in
the street, Bellew asked John Fergus O’Hea, ‘ the Arch-
bigot of Dublin,’ i.e., president of the Club, and then
cartoonist of United Ireland, which was the gentleman
who had been kind enough to prompt him. When he
was pointed out the eminent actor took him gently by
one shoulder, turned him round, and—kicked him. Then
he shook hands with him, and with an Irvingesque
‘ Good-night, gentlemen,’ vanished.”
Manager Williamson in Melbourne didn’t take kindly to
two of the Potter-Bellew dramas— “ Raquin ” and “ Fran-
cillon,” which partner Musgrove had recommended for
production. They are cerulean stories, both of them, and
J.C.W. accepts the comparative failure of “Camille” as
a proof that the local public doesn’t want more naughti-
ness at present.
Bellew, confiding in a Melb. interviewer, deduces from
the fact that the local playgoer does not display frantic
admiration for La Potter a conviction that Australian
audiences are far behind the times and cannot appreciate
subtlety of interpretation. Speaking of self and Brown-
Potter, the modest Kyrle remarks : “ It takes a public
that has been slowly developed in taste to appreciate so
big a change as this. [The change from mere melo-
dramatic ranting to ‘ subtlety of interpretation.] We have,
therefore, appeared here to some disadvantage.” Prac-
tically, the taste of the public is not educated up to a due
appreciation of the heavenly twins, Potter and Bellew.
The Divine Cora’s sorrow, it will be seen, is very like that
of Katisha : she has a moral collar-bone that is a miracle
of loveliness and a wisdom-tooth that almost stands alone,
but the dumb-driven public of Melbourne is oblivious to
these treasures ; for which, says Kyrle, the dunder-headed
critics are to blame. Which shows that P. and B. have
not struck overmuch oil, or butter, this trip.
Brisbane Liedertafel has again secured the sendees o!
“ Daddy ” Hallewell to sing at one of its concerts. On s
previous occasion Dad was accompanied by his pet pupil
—the contralto, Miss Louie Galvin (now Mrs. Peake),
Since the latter entered the marriage state Mr. Hallewell
has concentrated his tutorial energies upon that worthy
young lady, Miss Amy Simpson, the soprano, who will also
warble to the Brisbaneites. The lady singers of the North
are up in arms at the importation of the southern song-
sters.
A Bulletin remark that Wallace Brownlow (at latest
reported to be in treaty for music-hall accommodation at
Kftlgoorlie) had gone to Westralia at the “instigation ” of
W. R. Wilson, seems to have been misunderstood. It
meant that the baritone’s notions of western wealth came
from W.R.W. in the first instance.
Maggie Moore will really leave for America in Septem-
ber with a nice bag of “ Trilby ” profits to invest in new
dramatic goods, and a heart even fuller of gratitude than
when she came to Melbourne the other week. That advt.
of M.M.’s gratitude, by the way, was quite a genuine out-
burst. The perennial favorite recognises that the public
have allowed their liking for herself to color their opinion
of her show on some occasions. The common saying,
“ Maggie Moore is always good,” carries a second mean-
ing. They reckon her a real good sort as well as a real
good actress, and find a particular pleasure in being enter-
tained by her. The house is always with Maggie Moore.
“ The Voice of the Sea,” by riHolus, is a new song from
Allan’s, suitable for any mezzo-soprano or baritone who
may be feeling rather sad. It is a tuneful little ballad of
the dirge variety, and so brief that it comes to a full stop
ere the first tear of sympathy can begin to flow. In fact,
it is a very good thing to warble in the twilight, and
much less commonplace than several more pretentious
ballads just received from Ricordi, of London. Local
taste in song-construction Is improving.
Evangelist Varley wrote a scathing lengthy denuncia-
tion of Sarah Bernhardt, in Melb. She stuck it in her
album, and showed it to a London newspaper man, amid
the eulogies.
Frances Saville, whose recent American tour was suo"
cessful beyond expectations, is again in Paris. She made
her re-appearance in “ Traviata,” at the Op6ra Comique,
and met with a most enthusiastic reception.
“ The fool and his money are soon parted.” This par-
ticular fool is financing a biggish theatrical venture and a
professional lady of great velocity, who has already many
scalps at her girdle, the cowlicks of men of means who
tried to finance her alone and went under like plummets.
When the man of golden means gets in tow of the woman
of extremes it is practically all U.P. with the former, but
when a theatrical co. is thrown in to assist in the looting,
that man can go to bed and hear his money humming as
it runs.
The production of “La Tosca ” close upon the heels of
“ Charlotte Corday ” —said to be a little thing of Bellew’s
very own—is a decided give-away. The Corday drama is
simply “La Tosca ” writ small, with a dash of “ The
Village Priest” thrown in. In “Charlotte Corday” you
have in Marat the counterpart of Scarpia and Corday for
Tosca, and you get the fugitive from justice, followed in
both plays to the home of the artist, and in both plays the
heroine pig-sticks the villain to save her lover.
The veteran pianist, De Kontski, is a marvel to Mel-
bournites. On Sunday nights he has been at the German
club drinking much lager beer and smoking many cigars,
yet at the end of the evening is as spry as a young man.
At Prof. Hall’s concert last Saturday the Chevalier was
noticed reading the flowery annotator’s small print with-
out specs.
Brisbane stage ladies do not wear large hats to the
theatre, as that is the locally-recognised outward and
visible sign of the woman of the town.
One amusing incident in the recent Melbourne-Hebrew
performances of “Pinafore” was the collapse of a bridge
at the back of the nautical “ set.” An amateur marine
slipping through a hole in the scenery is undoubtedly
comic.
“ It used to cost something to run our show in its palmy
days,” said one of the Pollards, of the Pollard Juveniles, re-
cently ; “ the washing-bill for the kids’ clothes sometimes
came to £6O a week.” ■
The Bulletin steadfastly declines to believe that Fitts
Atkinson earr.3 £7O a week at the London ’alls. The
“Australian Orpheus” wasn’t a star of great magnitude
when his business was new. It’s old now, without being
venerable.
Bellew imitates Irving to about the same extent that
Scot Inglis, as Jacques, reverently mimics George Rigno d.
The Australian actor speaks, sighs, and wears exactly the
same air of composure as his former manager. And Rig-
nold isn’t a bad model to follow, mind you.
Paris Illustration, May 30 last, has a remarkable en-
graving of Fal°jui6re’s statue of Mdlle. de Merode, at the
Salon Exhibition. It is a complete reproduction of her
in the nude, except that her ears are covered by the
peculiar slabs in which she arranges her hair, wherefore
the current joke is on the chaste ears of Mdlle. de Merode
—a principal dancer at the Opera. The legs, as might be
expected, are of excellent shape, but the upper part of
the frame is a disappointment to those who think that an
ideal can be found otherwise than by Canova’s study of 60
women for his Venus. She is regarding a ring on her
finger, and the work is rather suggestive of the famous
Chloe, which roused a Melb. sensation.
“ Potter’s clay.”—Bellew.
Phil Stuart, frozen out of Melbourne for a time, success-
fully tours the Vic. western district with a selection of
Kreitmeyer’s Waxworks. Phil has Her Gracious Majesty,
Joe Chamberlain, Cecil Rhodes, and other distinguished
effigies in tow, and is supported by his wife, Isaberstuart,
and young Whitworth, who contribute jingo songs in
praise of their silent travelling companions.
“ Coo-ee ! An Australian Ballad,” is the title of the
latest song written by H. C. Coghlan and W. J. Turner.
The latter’s music is said to be very pleasing, and the
Coo-ee refrain a big thing. Glen and Co. will publish at
an early date.
Bertram Mackennal, Australia’s only sculptor abroad,

N.S. Wales, according to Treasurer Reid, has
for the year ending- 30th June a handsome surplus of
£333,000. As, however, the usual statements of the
year’s receipts and ordinary and loan expenditure have
not been supplied at time of writing, it is absolutely im-
possible to form any opinion as to how much of the
surplus is genuine, or whether there is any real surplus
or whether there is a deficit, or what there is. On the old
basis the liabilities of the year, even if they were not paid
at the date when the accounts closed, were reckoned as
expenditure, but. on the new “ cash basis ” everything
which is not actually paid, even if it is far overdue,
is left to be provided for next year. Considering
that the year’s liabilities which are not actually
paid at the date when the accounts close often reach
£500,000, the advantage which Treas. Reid gains
by making no provision for these and leaving them bodily
out of his calculations should account for all the
surplus and a good deal more. The present sys-
tem is undoubtedly the best one, but the fact
that it provides a surplus for the first year
—the year which had no liabilities left over from
the one before, and which carries all its unpaid bills on to
the one after—is no special proof of brilliant financing.
No estimate is furnished as to the amount of the liabilities
thus left over, but they are known to include .£55,000
under the item of railway loans, £28,000 towards redemp-
tion of Treasury bills, another £75,000 under the same
heading, £37,500 under another Railway Loan item, and
£12,000 towards the Naval Tribute, and the ordinary
unpaid accounts—which may reach half-a-million—in
addition, so the total apparently saved in this way must
be very large. Further, in the absence of any statement
of expenditure it is impossible to tell how much of the
surplus has been arrived at by charging repairs to roads
and bridges and dredges and other works of daily occur-
rence to loan expenditure. In fact, in the absence of all
detail it is impossible to be sure of anything.

It is a truly wondrous thing that N.S.W.’s
Freetrade Government last year raised £1,825,239 out of
Customs duties—almost the same amount as in Victoria.
Truly Freetrade is arriving very slowly.
The net public debt of N.S. Wales at June 30
was £60,656,873, and the increase for the year was
£2,437,340. The province passed the twenty-million limit
in 1882 ; it got over the thirty-million line in 'B5, and
passed the forty-million milestone in ’BB. In ’92 it got
past fifty millions, and now ’96 sees it well past sixty
millions. For 16 years there has not been one year
when the proportion of debt per head has not grown
bigger. The next borrow is to take place (locally, it is
alleged) in a few months, so the debt will now start to
sprint gaily for the seventy-million limit, and, with good
luck, it should not be far off at the close of the century.

The balance-sheet of the Bank of New Zealand
for the year ended 31st March doesn’t contain nearly so
much information as it might do, but the results, on the
whole, are much better than they have been of late. The
paid-up capital is now £2,547,413. Of this, £2,000,000 is
4 per cent, stock sold in London under State guarantee ;
£500,000 is in 34 per cent, preference-shares taken up by
the State ; and" £47,423 is the small remains of the once
immense capital of the private shareholders. -The net
profits for the year are £52,576, so presumably this means
the profit after paying 4 per cent, interest on the £2,000,000
stock and 34 per cent, on the £500,000 of State-owned
preference-shares, also the £50,000 which the bank is sup-
posed to pay annually towards the expected deficit in the
Estates Co/ It isn’t specifically stated that these charges
are provided for, but the term “net profit” certainly
implies so. On this basis the £52,576 is a remarkably good
return for the year’s work. The deposits are nearly
£10,000,000, and the total liabilities to the public about
£11,600,000. Against this, the B.N.Z. has £1,750,000 coin
and bullion ; over £1,000,000 in Stace sc curities the
usual big, indiscriminate item for “advances, &c.
One quaint item in tbe balance-sheet is the good-
will of the Colonial Bank, £75,000. This was the sum
actually paid for the Colonial’s business, so, in a sense, it
is legitimate enough. At the same time, it will obviously
have to be written off, for no bank can keep reckoning the
goodwill of its own business as an asset for ever, and
writing this off means £75,000 of leeway to make up.
Another asset which looks as if it wanted a lot of explan-
ation is “ shares in the B.N.Z. Estates Co. £1,089,822.
In the absence of any balance-sheet of the Estates Co. it
is impossible to guess whether its shares are worth some-
thing or nothing or less than nothing, and if so how much
less, but considering all things the million or so (book-
value) of the shares held by the B.N.Z. is a somewhat
shadowy-looking thing. Altogether, the exact position of
the B.N.Z. is a hard matter to arrive at on the informa-
tion supplied. However, if the year’s net. profit of
£62,576 is the profit after paying not only the 4 per cent,
interest on the £2,000,000 guaranteed stock, and 34 per
cent, on the State’s preference shares, but also the stipu-
lated £50,000 towards the shortage in the Estates Co., the
bank is doing remarkably well. And if the last item has
still to be provided for out of the profit, the B.N.Z. is
more than paying its way, which, considering the extra
expense of the last reconstruction and of the Colonial
Bank amalgamation, is soi*sthing. And if there was any
information as to when the realisation of the Estates Co. s
assets might be finished, and how long the B.N.Z. might
have to contribute towards the deficiency therein (if there
still appears to be one), and if some estimate were given of
the real value of the Estates Co.’s shares instead of simply
mentioning that they represent “ book-values/’ it might
be possible to form a more definite opinion. The B.N.Z.
was such an incredible muddle before the State took hold
of it that the chaos resolves itself very slowly.
Compared with such institutions as the National
of Australasia or the Victoria, the B.N.Z. has a hard row
to hoe. The National has almost as large a capital, but it
is the shareholders’ own capital; and, times being had, the
bank simply pays no dividends on the biggest part of it
until thev improve. The B.N.Z.’s capital is almost all
money borrowed at a fixed rate, and it must pay its 4 per
cent, or per cent, dividend whether times improve or
not. „ *

The conversion proposals of the A.J.S. Bank
have been accepted by about £1,000,000 worth of London
depositors, so about £500,000 will be paid off immediately
and £600,000 more renewed at 3 per cent. This successful
operation means a saving of £30,000 a year interest, which
is a considerable change for the better; and, as the sa'mg
is effected off the English depositors, it also means that
£30,000 a year less goes from this distressful country to
help along the dear oM mother-land. #
The Union Bank of Australia, according to
cable, had a net profit for the half-year ended 281*'Feb-
ruary of £37,996. La.-t half-year the amount was £36,063 ,
at February, ’95, it was £37,172; and for the half-year
ended August, ’94, it was £44,676. Therefore, things are
apparently getting no worse, even if they are not growing
much better. A dividend at 5 per cent, per annum
absorbs £37,600, and there is £496 to carry forward. The
present earnings represent an infinitesimal f raction over
S ner cent, per annum on the shareholders funiH
f£l 500,000 capital and £1,000,000 reserve) so even with
the'slight improvement above-noted things look none too
brilliant. It is also intimated that a re-valuation of
the securities has been made, and that the directors
have resolved to transfer £250,000 of the reserve to
a contingency account, but that this step is taken not
to cover any realised losses ”-it is merely because the
directors “think the transfer advisable. This explana-
tion of the ominous act looks rather bewildering. If the
directors have absolute confidence m the new valuation
and it shows the securities to be so remarkably good that
the Union has got through the last six awful yeais with-
out having any “ realised losses to cover, then things
are so solid that the demand for a big contingency account
seems inexplicable. This writing-off the reserve
down to £750,000 —the figure at which , :
years ago. The deposits are reported at £17,600,000, and
the cash and liquid assets at nO less than £6,800,000.

The reconstruction scheme of the E.S. and A.

The half-yearly report of the Trustees, Execu-
tors, and Agency 00. (Melb.), which appears in another
column, is a considerable amount better than the last one,
inasmuch as the net profits are £1702, against £256 last
half and £305 the one previous. Out of this profit the
directors spend £l2OO in paying a dividend at 4 per cent,
par annum, which leaves £502 to be added to profit-and-
loss, making the balance carried forward £4235. Con-
sidering the general state of the co., this dividend looks
rather uncalled-for. Six months ago £45,000 was taken
from reserve and allegedly put to a contingency-account;
but no contingency-account appeared in the balance-
sheet, and the amount was apparently all written off to
cover losses. This reduced the reserve to £40,000. The
present balance-sheet looks as if some more writing-off
was required before things got straight. The co.’s free-
hold property still stands at ) 65,000, and, as the net re-
turns for the half-year are £7l_9s. 2d. (equal to less than
five shillings per cent, per annum), it is just possible that
some writing-down would do this item good. Again, the
assets include £14,000 preference-shares and £lB,OOO de-
posits of the Australian Deposit and Mortgage Bank.
These items don’t appear—so far as Tub Bulletin can
trace—to have been written down, except that £2OOO has
been taken off the deposit-item ; and if, with this
exception, they are taken at par, which seems to
be the case, the lamentable fact must be faced
that the deposits have a market-value of only
about £15,000, and that the £14,000 of preference-
shares have no very definite or certanuralue at all that
this paper is aware of. Anyhow, the fact th»££49,507 of
mortgages, preference shares, deposits, and smre deben-
tures appear to have yielded only £4(71 for the six months
(equal to a little less than 2 percent, per annum all
round), and that even leaving out' fhe•-pi:eference shares,
which produce no dividend at present, "the return is less
than 3 per cent, per annum, it would sAem as if some-
thing wanted writing down rather badly._ The busi-
ness is improving greatly ; the cash in bank is £3200 more
than it was six months ago ; and as a trustee the co. looks
absolutely sound, but there is a lot of leeway to make up
before it amounts to much from a shareholder’s point of
view.

The Boyal Bank of Queensland issues another
prosperous-looking report. The half-year’s net profits to
30t.h June are £6445, as against £6032 last half and 5946
at 30th June, ’95. A dividend at the rate of Wi per cent,
absorbs £4687 10s., and the fact that the Boyal keeps so
persistently to this small div. and doesn’t struggle after
an unattainable 5 per cent, is a good point in its manage-
ment. Another £l5OO is carried to reserve, making it
£31,500. The Royal’s reserve is all separately invested in
State securities, so that it actually is a reserve. By its
reconstruction-scheme, this, institution is pledged to
put one-fourth of its profits to this fund, and
if it has patience and brains enough to keep
on this course for a century or so, it should
became one of the safest and richest institutions in Aus-
tralia. The Royal’s total liabilities to the public, including
its reconstructed deposits, are £760.0 r.i, and against this
it has £215,000 in cash and State securities, equal to about
30 per cent. After paying dividend amt dividend-tax and
reserving the above mentioned £l5OO, there remains £7178
to credit of profit and loss, and £4OOO of this is applied to
start a contingency fund to cover possible losses and de-
preciation in the'future—a distinctly wise move, as it
may save the reserve from serious damage when the next
catastrophe comes along. Altogether, the position of the
Royal looks satisfactory in every respect.
The Mercantile Mutual Fire Insurance Co. de-
clares an interim dividend at the rate of 20 per cent, per
annum. The City Mutual Fire Co. pays an interim div. at
10 per cent, per annum, free of income-tax, and the New
Zealand Insurance Co. an interim dividend at 12j4 per
cent.

The S.M. Herald objects to the State fire-
insurance idea in these terms:—“The M.L. Government
has not given better results from its life-insurance depart-
ment than have been obtained from, say, the management
of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, its most
vigorous competitor, and there is reason to doubt whether
a fire-insurance department will give a S', comparatively
good results as the life office.” This comparison with the
A.M.P. Society is the stereotyped argument. But the
A.M.P. had for many years practically a monopoly, and it
got together an immense connection before competition
began to run up the expenses. The Maoriland Govern-
ment Department, when it grows as large and as obi as
the A.M.P., may show as cheap a system of working.
Meanwhile its case is this : It is safer, by reason of its
State guarantee, than any other office. It is worked at a
lower cost than any private office of its size and age. Its
bonuses are lower than those of its principal private rival,
the A.M.P. Society, but this is in great part because its
premiums are much lower. Bonises are simply arrived
at by charging more premium t han is necessary and hand-
ing back the surplus ; at age 40, for £lOOO. of assurance,
the M.L. Government Department charges £2 15s. a year
less than the A.M.P., which is equal to a bonus of over £5
at the end of the year. Also, the percentage of expenses
is higher, but this is partly because the premiums are less;
£lO of expenses on £lOO of premiums is 10 per cent., but
if the premiums for the same business are only 91, then
the same expenses are 11 per cent. On a fair basis of com-
parison the State insurance office is an amazingly short
distance behind its far larger and older private com-
petitor. * m
The provision in the Vic. Companies Bill which
enacts that every co. must have its balance-sheet posted
up in the office where it will be visible to all comers
brought up that weariful person, ex-Treas. Carter, of
meat-man Patterson’s late Ministry. Carter said that
this move would only “pander” to somebody or other,
and would produce untold disaster of some kind or other.
And when it was mentioned to him that many banks post
up their balance-sheets now, and that most companies
with which the public is concerned advertise them in
the papers as well, Carter was almost too surprised to
speak.

The Companies Amendment Act (Vic.) presents
a very one-sided appearance to ex-Premier Shiels, who
himself dabbles in finance. “The solvency of a c 0.,”
according to Shiels, “doesn’t depend upon stringent
legislation, but on that shrewd intuitive knowledge of
business which leads directors and managers to lend
moneys wisely.” By the same token the insolvency' of a
company depends upon that intuitive greed for gold
which leads directors to gamble with the cash. Stringent
legislation is required to make directors go straight.
That’s all. The policeman is the strongest of all incen-
tives to honesty.

formed Argus, but the explanation of this change doesn’t
harmonise with recent statements in Parliament. There
(and elsewhere in Melbourne) the lawyers have a cant say-
ing that “ nothing is so easy to prove as conspiracy.”
The old “ gag ” has served its turn. Now The Bulletin
waits patiently for the news that nothing is so easily dis-
proved as concurrence.

pates making the burglary insurance pay as a branch, as it

Let those who are being enticed to embark in
companies projected to work small sulphide-bearing
mines in the Broken Hill district reflect upon the position
at Broken Hill itself. There, big mines like the South,
developed on the proceeds of the carbonate ores, and
already equipped with winding and pumping plant, can
make only a small profit, if any at all, though the rail-
way-trucks run right to tlie shaft’s mouth, bringing
timber, coal, &c., and taking away ore and concen-
trates, on a specially-low freight-scale. These Broken
Hill mines have ore bodies which, for size and regu-
larity, are incomparably the largest and best in the
district, and yet the payment of divs. is a laborious
process, expedited now' and then by the discovery of
some bier “ chimney ” like that of the Junction, or by
the operation of the carbonates which still remain in
small quantities in the upper levels. If the investors
saw the economies (especially in the matter of hand-
ling the ore) that have to be exercised at the Broken
Hill mines to enable a profit to be made out of sulphides,
they would hesitate to put a penny into a sulphide mine
that hasn’t a railway running alongside its shaft. Some
day, perhaps, when a chemical or electrical process is
available for the extraction of the metals from the ore 'at
the mine, w’ithout the necessity to concentrate or roast
the ore, these small outside “ shows ” may be valuable ;
but, for the present, when water is necessary to concen-
trate, and when the weighty concentrates haye to be
carted to the seaboard, their prospects are inexpressibly
poor.

On a genuine enough improvement in the west
deep crosscut in the B.H. North shares have firmed. But
though they have an ore body it is poor, bearing no re-
semblance to the west lode in the Junction, of which it is
probably an extension.
“ Anticipation is greater than realisation,” and
so British shares “ slumped ” after the concentrating mill
was started. “There’ll be a rise when the mill gets
going,” everybody said ; and so everybody started to
“ pay out ” scrip at the same time. The result is quite
surprising to a lot of people who believed they had struck
such a brilliant idea. Yet the mill goes well, compara-
tively speaking, and underground few mines will go on
improving as the British does.

In connection with the Newcastle coal-miners’
strike and foreign competition, here is a striking com-
parison of the export-trades of N.S.W. and Japan since
1890 : -
Year. N.S.W.—Tons. Japan.—Tons.
1891 ... 2,244,729 ... 895,320
1892 ... 2,191,705 ... 900,398
1893 ... 1,835,090 ... 1,094,754
1894 ... 2,125,125 ... 1,265,504
1835 ... 2,166,230 ... 1,376,068
But a comparison of the values of the exports, stated in
the respective currency of the two countries, is still more
striking :
N.S.W.— £. Japan.—Yen.
1891 ... 1,160,965 ... 3,179,202
1892 ... 1,023,395 ... 2,854,299
1893 ... 814,929 ... 3,288,842
1894 ... 804,769 ... 4,674,304
1895 ... 773,954 '... 5,409,110
The figures are taken from the annual reports of the
N.S.W. Department of Mines and the last report of the
Deliartment of Finance of Japan respectively. Stated in
other terms, the selling-price of coal shipped by the white
man has fallen from 10s. 4d. per ton in LB9l to 7s. Id. per
ton in 1895; the selling-price of that shipped by the
yellow man has risen from 3J yen in 1891 to 4 yen in 1895.

The lucky tributors (four men) of Great Cobar
(N.S.W.) copper-mine are understood to be now making
for themselves a steady £lOOO a week net profit. Between
1870 and 1889 the mine, according to Sydney D.T., pro-
duced 23,610 tons of copper from 213,182 tons ore, and
paid 1.151,000 in divs. But the shareholders didn’t know
that those 23,610 tons each contained 4oz. gold ! so that,
,say, £370,00il worth of gold was given away absolutely
without consideration. What a comforting reflection to
the innocents who turned over the mine to the tributors
as a troublesome and doubtful concern ! The tributors
are understood to he Messrs. A. J. Gould (N.S.W. Justice-
Minister), A. A. Dangar (two shares), Dr. Reid, of Single-
ton, and Longworth, manager and master-spirit, to whom
the enormous success of the enterprise is -almost solely
d le. The tributors, by the aid of water-jacket furnaces,
turn out, say, 3100 tons of copper annually (present value,
about £136,000, besides £50,090 worth of gold), as against
1460 tons, the highest output of the old company under
its antiquated system. They are said to have bought up
a very large number of the co.’s shares, and their tribute
has six-and-a-half years still to run.

From Marble Bar (W.A.) : —Re N.W. wild-
cats and Geraldton Express, your leading article on the
Westralian mining-boom applies equally to North and
South. The gross ignorance shown by the British investor
is astounding. Dozens of reefs have been floated for large
amounts, which have not a ghost of a chance of ever pay-
ing even working expenses, and in many cases managers
are put in charge who have not the faintest idea of

w’ithout making even the slightest show of work. Small

the shape of a matrix of gold has been palmed off on the

London Figaro wrote on May 21st: “After
some months of anxious waiting, and one or two false
starts, the boom in West Australian mining-shares seems
at last to be fairly under weigh.” The fifty or sixty W.A.
mines in liquidation, or about to liquidate, must have
been floated during one of the boom’s false starts.

The General Gordon North Extended has been
re-baptised as the General Gordon Junction, and will be
floated (D.V.) under the briefer name. There are tales of
new developments in the G.G. Junction, which, on more
or less unreliable information, is to prove “ the dandy of
the line.” Meanwhile, the G.G. line seems to be chiefly
famous for its rich market resources. The gold has yet to
come.

Mr. Zeb. Lane, at the Great Boulder meeting
in London “ The report I made in the prospectus
clearly set out that the value of the Boulder lode was
equal to soz. to the ton. I have returned to you, and, 1
think, proved that that statement is amply verified.
(Loud applause.) The mine started with great opposi-
tion, and after I left you I heard serious opposition was
brought to bear to see if they could not prove that the
mine was actually valueless.” Every sentence of Zeb s
speech was applauded, and when he was finished he was
“greeted with loud and continuous cheering.’ The
world judges all things by their results : the Great Boulder
is, in a way, the Bean case of mining. Not the faintest
allusion was made to the fact that the lode alluded to in
the original reports is not the lode from which the Boulder
gold is coming—-nobody then dreamt of the latter s
existence. The present rich lode was found long after-
wards, on cutting a very long and deep trench to try and
find the source of rich gold got by (try-blowers. This,
when struck, consisted of two very thin rich veins which,
when sunk on, opened out into a formation carrying good
gold from wall to wall. Marvellous as Lane’s luck has
been, it has not been big enough to go all round the W.A.
mines with which he has been mixed up, but the success
of one Great Boulder is enough to cover many failures.
* * * *
Somebody wants to know why it is that the
W.A. mining-market fell so sharply two days after the
heavy rain-fall over the Coolgardie fields. Was it the rush
to unload as soon as the fields, like the stocks, had been
copiously watered?

Bamboo Reward mine, Pilbarra, W.A.,
manager’s report: “ I have a great opinion of this mine
for the future, although we have nothing extra at pre-
sent.” Even this was regarded as satisfactory by the
English shareholders at their half-yearly meeting in Lon-
don, and the chairman said he thought a little time would
prove it one of the best mines in W.A.
The Brown Hill (Hannan’s) second crushing :
113 tons for 2570 z. For many months the public have
been led, per newspaper, to think the Brown Hill mine
was richer than the Great Boulder. No excuse has yet
been given for a 2£oz. instead of a lOoz. result.

Advt. from Sydney D.T. : “An opportunity is
offered a young gentleman with £lOO as assistant to
experienced prospector from and who is returning to
W.A. GOLDFIELDS. A prosperous future assured.
( G.P.O.” Evidently a “ young gentleman
not “ more than 7” —is required. There is one class o
prospector, and one only, who can “ assure ” any “ young
gentleman with £100” a “prosperous future” out of the
W.A. goldfields. That “prosperous future” would be
through the gateway of a bush martyrdom.

Fat man, writes a correspondent, has sat down
firmly on the Vic. coal industry. Despite the heavy public
subsidy that the directors draw from the Vic. railways in
the shape of low carriage charges, they have worked v p

the Newcastle strike. As a return, however, they liav ■

The alluvial mines at Pitfield and Rokewood, in
Victoria, are supposed to be a continuation of the main
leads which made the Sebastopol plateau (Ballarat)
famous in the early days of alluvial mining in Victor!'.
In another column is published the prospectus of th;
British Banner G.M. Co. (No Liability), being formed in
Melbourne to work a property of 200 acres at Pitfield.
This area is supposed to contain the same gutter from
which seven or eight mines—among them the New
Estate, the Beal Estate, the Eldorado, the New Moon, the
West Estate, the Pitfield Plateau, and the Union Co. —are
now getting gold. All these leads are supposed to trend
directly into the British Banner ground, where the exist-
ence of the gutter has been proved by boring. Capital is
required to put down a new shaft, so 12,000 shares are now
offered to the public at 2s. each. Mr. George D. Meudell
and Messrs. Ellison and Evered, brokers, Melbourne, are
open to receive applications. Some .well-known mining
men are on the directorate.*

Hauraki, M.L., for June : 350 tons, 20940 z.,

Kapai Vermont, M.L., for the month : 308 tons,
2500 z. gold (only worth about £2 10s. an oz). The short-
lived glory of this mine seems to be departing, and, no

Tasmania G.M. shareholders are wondering
where all the money goes. May crushings panned out :
Retorted gold valued at £12,769. This only paid a Is. 6d.
div. and income-tax, £3780, reserve-fund, £l5OO, general
account, £l2OO, leaving for working account, £6289.
June crushings : Retorted gold worth £15,476 ; another
18d. div. and income-tax, £3780, reserve-fund, £l5OO, and
£10,196 of which no particulars have been given. Adding
to this about £3560, estimated value of concentrates from
both crushings, we have a total of £20,045 for two months’
working expenses! According to these figures, every
pound’s worth of gold costs nearly 15s. to produce. It
looks like buying gold.
The Tasmania has, since its formation, turned
out 364,3780 z. gold from 291,757 tons of quartz. Total
value, £1,316,658. Divs., £616,275.

Gov. Brassey is learning. His ball the
other night was a comparatively gorgeous affair
and as cheese to chalk compared with the first
function with which he expected to astonish
Victorian sassiety a couple of months back. That
historic sluyoo was scarcely likely to infuse the
desired spirit of loyalty into the bosoms of the
apathetic, who regard the tightening of the silken
bonds as a secondary consideration to a decent
teed or a fiery spoon between dances. Invitations
being timed at 9p.m., the guests rolled up at Guv'
mentouse accordingly to find the doors shut 4s
the minutes passed, many more arrived, until the
portico resembled the door of a theatre-gallery on
the first night of a pantomime.
Tr ately ’ W ¥ n ? hose wbo couldn’t crush under
the shelter were fairly wet through with the heavy
rain a burst of light proclaimed that H.E. had fin-
ished dinner, and the crowd tumbled in to straighten
their Princess May fringes and pour the water out of
their white satin shoes. The ballroom being entered
it was found that there was to be no dancine-’

When lull-dress was commanded at the notorious
Birthday reception, Lord B. turned out in
nis ordinary black uniform, which is neither
smart nor very becoming ; but the other
evening both H.E. and his vice-regal ally
from Sydney affected gorgeous array and
shone resplendent in full Court uniform
white knee-breeches, silk stockings and buckled
shoes included. Lady B. wore green velvet and
lace, and Lady Hampton sported a nondescript
gown of claret velvet and fawn satin with pale
blue transparent stuff, and a plume of blue
leathers on one shoulder. There was a good show
ot diamonds in divers places.

The way in which balls are managed at
Guvmentouse, Melb., leads to curious complica-
tions. Ihe acceptable guests are divided alpha-
betically into two battalions, the first half of the
alphabet being invited to ball No. 1, and the other
half to ball No. 2. The result is that if Mr. B. is
engaged to Miss R. and has a hated rival in Mr.
W., B. never gets a chance of going to a vice-
regal ball with his girl, but has to stew at home
in the miserable consciousness that the detested
W. may be whirling round the fair R. in the in-
toxicating circles of tile waltz.

Who was the recreant cycler of the ride
that was never ridden in the ballroom at Govt.

Lords Brassey and Hampden, speaking at

has. He applied recently to a county court judge
to have the solicitor struck off the rolls, but was
gravely informed that the court had no jurisdic-

him to sue the solicitor for conversion. He is now,
it is said, issuing writs for tens of thousands
damages for illegal detention, dilapidation of heir-
looms, or something of that nature. The solicitor
concernpd is the principal member of one of the

A Southern capital was lately in a turmoil
over rumors of several divorce-suits, in more than

surprised scandal-lovers by entering an action

The New Woman has turned up in a prac-
tical form in Maoriland, judging from the plaint
of an infuriated Sabbatarian in a northern town.
According to this individual, two young and sinful
people in his district have become engaged.
With their joint savings they have bought a patch
of scrub-land, and every Sunday they arrive there
early and the girl clears and burns off the scrub all
day while the man pegs in vigorously at building a
wooden house. When the house is finished they
propose to get married and burn off the rest of the
scrub jointly, after which they will spend the rest
of their Sundays in putting up the fence. The
adjacent man writes to say that this line of conduct
won’t bring down a blessing on the new house,
but then nobody expects much of a blessing on a
four-roomed place built of weatherboards.
A “middle-aged” man, having been ar-
rested the other day on the N.S.W.-Yic. border
for having deserted his wife at Hay (N.S.W.), re-
marked : “I would sooner be hanged than return

A Darling River boundary-rider, to make
*ure that, in his absence, travellers would not take
any of his bagful of flour, left a notice on top of
it —“Poisoned !” A swaggy passed, looked into
the hut, saw the flour, filled all his bags, and
wrote below the “poisoned”—“lf it wasn t
poisoned before, it’s poisoned now alright, you
dog.” That boundary-rider, on returning, threw
the flour into the river. He wasn’t going to chance
it.

a Bulletin correspondent). One leading stud
sheep-breeder, formerly a politician, pays his
ploughman ss. per week : he has to plough an acre
per day, and cut chaff for two horses. An old
man on the same place, who acts as groom and
gardener, gets 3s. per week. I was lately in a
shearing-shed where a little boy of about 12 years
picked up and swept for 10 shearers. On my
remarking to the classer that the boy had too
much to do, he replied, “ Yes ; and the poor little
wretch gets just five bob a week for it all.” An
old maiden of means lately got a young lady as
companion, giving her £l2 a year, with a promise
of £3 more if she would milk. As no servant is

“I hear you are going to be married, Mary.
“ Yes, ma’am.”
“ And what is he? ”
“ Well, ma’am, he’s only a policeman. We can’t all have gentlemen!”
kept, a companion’s duties may be guessed a,t. A
very wealthy old lady on the East Coast had a
young lady as lady’s' help. Her duties included
washing and scrubbing floors; wages, <£l3 per
annum. After some months of this work she was
one morning ordered by her kind mistress to go
and help some men pull a cow out of a bog. This
THE BEERY SAMARITAN.
REV. PROHIBITIONIST : “ Yes, my dear sisters and brotheren, we must all remember
to give the pore victim of alkeholic pizen our sympathy and our protec-
tion. We must, in short, had the part of the Good Samaritan to him.

Bank Place, off Collins-st., Melb., is the
local sharpers’ dumping-ground—and admirably
constructed it is for the purpose. There are ap-
parently only two entrances —viz., from Collins-
street and Chancery Lane but anyone who
“ knows ” is aware that there are at least a dozen
exits and entrances apart from the main thorough-
fares. The tenants on either side are either of the
Devil’s brigade, or are accountants, and to the
usual countryman the place has an eminently
respectable appearance. After the fleecing, the
victim is brought to the locality and asked to wait
outside whilst the hawk interviews a relative or
friend who occupies one of the offices. Enter the
hawk and if q lieklylostto view, never, if possible,
to again meet his victim, who at last quits his
post with the truth fully dawning upon him
—he has been shorn. One particular firm whose
principal was almost worried to death by enquir-
ing countrymen dailv wanting to know “where
their friend was—would he soon be coming out,”
&c., &c., instructed its clerks to ring up the Detec-
tive Department whenever they saw anyone wait-
ing on the pavement for more than five minutes —
the result being that hostilities have already begun
over numerous false alarms. Moreover, the legal
and financial sharks in the neighborhood now view
the game with envious eyes, and have come to the
conclusion that if the fleecer uses their premises as
avenues of escape he will either have to pay rent
or divide plunder.

Suicide takes strange forms in the back-
country. The other day, a Queensland bushman
suicided by tying a stockwhip-lash round his
throat, fastening the other end to a tree-trunk, and
pulling violently backwards until he was stran-
gled. . . . Northern papers are also retailing
a story of a cranky Chow who took a pickaxe
down a well and hollowed out the sides until he
was crushed to death in the ultimate collapse.
His last words were, “Me allee same Blitish
subjeek.”

A Sydney lady who has, as she puts it, the
advantage of being a divorcee, met a rebuff lately
on seeking to be re-married by a local Anglican
clergyman. He sent her angrily away with a
diocesan rule tingling in her ear. Under the
Primate a cleric may or may not, just as he likes,
marry a woman who has been divorced.
Demise : The old Age office, Elizabeth-
street, Melb., just pulled down. The London
Tavern, next door, never properly held its head
up after Syme flitted into his new Collins-street
place —more lucky than Mirams’s Premier Per-
manent palace, next door. The saying used to be
that the Age had a staff of Tories, and the Argus
one of Democrats. Most of the best Argus men,
such as Willoughby, worked on the Age. Indeed,
the Argus people used to regard the Age as their
training-university. How now? Only of com-
paratively recent years has there been the scandal
of Argus men going to the Age —but Windsor,
the only man who has edited both papers, was an
avant-courier, or stormbird. Look at “ The
Vagabond,” again—and Marcus Clarke.

A brace of burglars who “ opened ” the
suburban house of a Melbourne artist, took the
trouble to tear into a thousand bits a large picture
of Oeorge Higinbotham which hung on the wall.
Good Tories, probably, who had “ done time” on
the dead Judge’s order.
The pris’ner said, without demur,
In simple, touching' way :
“ A boon, I crave. I would prefer
If such a boon may be for me,
Though ‘ life is sweet,’ to hanged be
Upon the deadly gallows-tree,
Than going back to Hay,
Than going back to Hay—and Her !
Believe me, listen well
To what I sanely say,
For Hay, with Her, is Hell,
And Hell, without Her, Hay.”
THE CONQUEROR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Contentedly she smiles
To see him kneeling, pleading at her feet;
No tender feeling, naught of passion’s heat
The damsel knows
Till, fully conscious of his love’s defeat,
The suitor goes,
Enthralled no longer by her careless wiles.
’Tis then she smiles.
Contentedly he smiles
To hear her sobbing when, once more, they meet,
To feel the throbbing of her bosom sweet
Against his breast.
With richest spoils of victory complete
His lips are blest;
They walk on air together, many miles—
Tis then he smiles.
Reluctantly it smiles,
Whilst (calmly thinking of their youth unwise,
Each figure shrinking in the other’s eyes)
They own the truth
That, Love’s a fiction, born of lovers’ lies,
Which dies, forsooth,
When mundane fact its purity defiles.
Then Wisdom smiles.

Bulletin never prints serials. It loathes them. Once it
printed several instalments of a continued-in-our-next
story, but after a few weeks it felt that it had a load on
its chest, and it dropped that story right there. And to the
best of this paper’s belief no one ever enquired what had
become of the rest of the tale. Bulletin doesn’t want
any story over two cols., and it has much respect for
people who, having written two cols., find that it can be
boiled down to one col.—and boil it accordingly H.C.

that a certain actor, before taking to the stage, was a

the A.J.S. Bank, on his acquittal writted the bank, claim-

Then the bank brought five other charges, two of which
were heard at Maitland. On these Monteagresti was
again acquitted—the Attorney-General declined to pro-
ceed on the other three. Later on, yet another charge
was brought (but not directly by the bank), dating back

The Lancy Mortons and
Others,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Time. 7.30 p.m. Place, the drawing-room of
Borwongonoo station, near Yarakagibee.
Hostess, Mrs. Sam Cameron, who was born
and bred and married and will die within
* cooee of Yarakagibee. She stands by the
piano. Her husband sits on the other side of
the fireplace. Some guests have arrived ;
others are arriving.
Mrs. Andrew Macintosh : “ Goodni-eght, Mrs.
Cameron ; how are you toni-eght ? ”
Mrs. Sam (in a low, nervous voice): “ Goodni-
eght, Mrs. Macintosh.”
Mrs. Andrew (afraid that anyone may hear) :
“ It’s a ni-ece ni-eght toni-eght.”
Mrs. Sam (she turns her head away, as though
the guests were listening): “Yes, it’s a lovely
ni-eght toni-eght.”
(They have shaken hands, and now stand
silently facing each other. Then Mrs. Andrew
moves uncertainly towards Mrs. Jem Cameron, a
guest near the door. She kisses her. They say,
“Well, Ethel!” and “Well, May!” ‘Mrs.
Andrew then kisses the next guest, Mrs. Henry
Macintosh, who kisses her, and says “How are
you?” as she says “How are you?” Then she
kisses and is kissed by Mrs. Jack Macintosh, and
Mary Macintosh, and Mrs. Dick Macintosh, and
Mrs. Peter Cameron, and shakes hands with
Peter and Jem and Sam Cameron, and Jack and
Dick and Henry Macintosh, and seats herself on
the edge of the green sofa, and sinks into the
intense silence of the arrived guests.)
Mrs. John Macintosh (mother of all the Macin-
toshes) : “Well, Sara ! (kiss) I see you’ve got on
your best dress, my dear. Is it true that the
Lancy Mortons are coming ? I’ve only got on my
old grey poplin. Mrs. Jack told me in the bed-
room, just now, that you were expecting them. Is
my cap on straight, Sara ? ”
Mrs. Sam (who was a Miss John Macintosh) :
“ I only asked them yesterday, mother, and I
hadn’t time to let you know. Sam made me ask
them, but I didn’t think they’d come.”
Mrs. John Macintosh : “ And they’re coming
after only getting asked yesterday ! ” She moves
away, and goes the round of kissing Mrs. Jack
and Dick, and Henry Macintosh, and Mrs. Jem
and Peter Cameron, with pre-ocoupied eyes and a
proud heart, because the grand Lancy Mortons
have come to her daughter’s evening at one day’s
invitation.
* * * *
Mrs. Lancy Morton and Mrs. Sam Cameron.
Mrs. Lancy Morton (a tall, peevish-looking,
fair woman in green, with a fringe net, and a cloak
with a high collar): “ How do you do, Mrs.
Cameron. Will you excuse me if I keep my cloak
on ? I have a cold. Lancy is changing his shoes
for the dancing, and will follow me in a minute.”
Mrs. Sam : “ Dancing! ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “I understood there was
to be dancing.”
Mrs. Sam : “ But we haven’t got a floor ! ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton (who is reported by herself
to have been a Sydney belle): “I certainly under-
stood that it was dancing. Lancy told me so
himself, and asked me if I would play my waltz.”
Mrs. Sam : “I am very sorry. If we had a
floor —but there isn’t any floor. We haven’t got
one. ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “If you have dancing,
your guests are always entertained. I find it the
simplest form of entertainment. ‘ Evenings ’ are
so slow without dancing, I think, unless you have
the very best music. And, of course, you can’t
have that in Yarakagibee.”
Mrs. Sam : “Down at mother’s they have a
splendid floor.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “In the season I used to
dance nine hours a night at the Sydney dances —I
used to get twenty invitations in one week.”
Mrs. Sam : “ Fancy ! ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “People in Sydney never
think of asking you without giving a dance for
you. I know they always did for me.”
Mrs. Sam : “ I wish we had a floor. ” (She begins
to wish, too, that she had never asked Mrs. Lancy
Morton to this slow evening of hers.)
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Are the Coolloobooloo
Joneses coming to-night?”
Mrs. Sam (nervously) : “ No, they’re not.
They’re not coming.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton (very much surprised) :
“ Aren't they? Oh! I thought they would be
sure to be here. Lancy said they would. Are the
Wurragurra Smiths coming ? ”
Mrs. Sam (reddening painfully) : “No, they’re
not coming to-night.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton (intensely surprised) :
“Not? Oh, fancy I I thought they’d be sure to
be. I wanted to see Ernestine Smith, too. That
was really what I—l thought she’d be sure to be
here.”
Mrs. Sam : “ Here comes Mr. Murphy from
Jimmibong.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton: “Is that the Mr. Murphy
who sells wine ? ”
Mrs. Sam: “He owns the Jimmibong vine-
yards. ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Fancy ! He’s always
trying to get Lancy to buy wine from him. Fancy
him being here. Do you know him well? ”
Mrs. Sam (miserably): “ He doesn’t make the
wine himself. Everybody likes him, I think.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “I have never met him
at anyone’s house before.” (She moves away,
and is seized by Mrs. John Macintosh, the mother
of all the Macintoshes.)
* * * *
Mrs. Dick Macintosh and Mrs. Sam Cameron.
Mrs. Dick Macintosh (whispering): “ I see
you’ve got Mrs. Lancy Morton here, Sara. Is
she nice ? ”
Mrs. Sam : “ Oh, she’s so nice, Lily. You
wouldn’t believe how nice she is. I have just
been talking to her for a long time. ”
Mrs. Dick : “ She knows how to dress, doesn’t
she, Sara?”
Mrs. Sam : “Well, her husband is dull enough.
Sam says his father bought the whole of Coollalic
Station outright, and made it over to him. It’s
worth seven hundred thousand, Sam says. Mrs.
Morton used to get twenty invitations a week in
Sydney.”
Mrs. Dick : ‘ ‘ Did she really ! Who told you
so ? ”
Mrs. Sam : “ She told me so herself.”
Mrs. Dick : “ Did she really ? Was she talking
to you for long ? ”
Mrs. Sam: “Yes; we’ve been having quite a
long chat. Oh, I like her so much. I think she’s
such a nice person, Lily. Doesn’t she do her hair
beautifully ? I must get her to show me how she
does it. Here comes Mr. Benedict, the new
curate.”
* * * *
The Curate and Mrs. Cameron.
Curate : “ I am glad the weather favors you,
Mrs. Cameron.”
Mrs. Sam (who has heard how clever the Curate
is): “ The moon is looking lovely toni-eght. ”
Curate: “Wonderful what an effect moonlight
has on scenery. I walked here to-night through
the bush, and my only regret was that I could not
read Tennyson by moonlight.”
Mrs. Sam : “ Have you read Tennyson’s * In a
Garden ’ ? I like it so much.”
Curate: “In a Garden? In a Garden? Do
you mean Maud ? ”
Mrs. Sam : “I mean ‘ln a Garden,’ by Tenny-
son. It’s very sad.”
Curate : “ In a Garden. In a Garden ! But I
don’t know anything of that name by Tennyson.
I know him from cover to cover, too. How does
it begin ? ”
Mrs. Sam : “ Oh, it’s about a man and his wife.”
Curate : “In a Garden ; In a Garden. By
Tennyson. A man and his wife. Don’t know it
at all.
Mrs. Sam : “ They’re married, and he goes away
to sea.”
Curate : “No, I can’t have read it. It must be
something published since his death. Is it long
since you read it ? ”
Mrs. Sam: “I was talking about it to Mr.
Arthurs, the clergyman at Goodonoo. He said he
liked it so much ” (She would turn the con-
versation now if she could).
Curate : “ Can you tell me anything about it ? ”
Mrs. Sam (desperately): “Hegoes away to sea,
and when he comes back she is married to another
man.”
Curate (light breaking on him suddenly) :
“Why you must mean” —(he stops suddenly,
then he mumbles to himself—“ In a Garden ,
Enoch Arden. In a Garden, Enoch Arden," and
gets out on to the verandah. Years hence, when
e gives his famous lecture, “Never Judge by
Hearsay,” this will be the funniest story in the
lecture).
* * * *
Mrs. John Macintosh and Mrs. Lancy Morton.
Mrs. John Macintosh : “ Well, Mrs. Morton,
and how do you think you’re going to like Yara-
kagibee ? ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ I have never in my life
known such a slow place.”
Mrs. J.M. : “ Slow ! Now, do you think it’s
slow ? Oh, not in the season, when the show, and
the races, and the balls come on. It’s very lively
then, Mrs. Morton.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Do they have balls ? ”
Mrs. J.M. : “ Yes, they have a race-ball in my
son Richard’s woolshed, and the show-ball is
generally in my son Henry’s big barn.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Heavens ! a race-ball
in a woolshed ! Do they have the races in Mrs.
Cameron’s back yard ? ”
Mrs. J. M.: “Which Mrs. Cameron, my dear ? ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton: “Which? Goodness
knows ! How many are there ? ”
Mrs. J. M.: “ Well, there’s Sara —Mrs. Sam—
and Ethel-Mrs. Jem—and Clara —Mrs. Peter
—and then Mrs. James Cameron— Sam’s and
Jem’s and Peter’s mother. That’s four Mrs.
Camerons.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton (ignorant of the relation-
ships) : “Well, if they’re all as slow as this one
—I never went to such an evening. She doesn’t
introduce. Doesn’t get up any music, or singing.
And there all the men sit along one side of the
wall, and all the women along another, and no-
body attempts to say a word. I don’t know why
Lancy made me come, unless he thought it was
good for business.”
Mrs. John Macintosh : “Dear me! I think
they ought to be having some game soon. Sara
is very good at games.”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Who is Sara? ”
Mrs. John Macintosh : “ She is my daughter,
Mrs. Sam Cameron. I’ll go and ask her about the
games.”
* * * *
Mrs. Lancy Morton and her Husband.
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Come home, quick.
They’re going to play games. Come home, quick!"
Lancy Morton: “Well, they won’t hurt us.
Will they play kiss-in-the-ring ? ”
Mrs. Lancy Morton : “ Kiss-in-the-ring ! My
dear boy ! Do you know that everyone of these
women are related, and all the men, too. And
the men are all married to the women, and their
mothers are here, and the women are all sisters or
sisters-in-law, and all the men are brothers. Ive
had toothache all the evening. You never told
me that they were all one family. Ive ruined
your prospects here for ever. And now you want
to play kiss-in-the-ring. Why, there’d be battle
and murder in five minutes. You’d be torn to
pieces by Jem and Sam and Dick and Peter
and Henry, for you’d have to kiss Mrs. Jem, or
Mrs. Sam, or Mrs. Dick, or a wife of one of
them.”
Lanoy Morton : “At that rate, we had better
go home.”
* * * *
Later.— Mrs. Andrew Macintosh and Mrs.
Peter Cameron.
Mrs. Andrew : “ Sara is such a good hand at
giving an evening. She can talk to anyone at all.
Mrs. Peter : “ Oh, she’s very good ; she always
was. She knows how to do the thing properly.
The Lancy Mortons said ‘ Thank you for a very
pleasant evening’ when they were going away.”

Cobar’s police magistrate is now a Pooh-

Yet another American person who has
engaged to tread the earth moneyless for a
wager has reached Sydney. This makes the how
many thousandth ? The industry threatens to
run tourist agencies out of business.
There is to be a fearsome rO-union of Syd-
ney Scotchmen to commemorate the fact that
Bobbie Burns died 100 years ago—2lst July, 1796.
At first blush it seems strange that the poet’s ad-
mirers should rejoice over barley-bree and sheep’s-
entrails on such an anniversary of gloom; but
anyone who has seen haggis at a vast distance will
realise the aptness of the tribute. There is
nothing in the wide world so funereal as haggis.
To this paper, one of the humorous fea-
tures of the fist-fight between Crick and Meagher,
in a Sydney hotel-bar the other day, is the fact
that Meagher attributes some of his bad blood to
a Bulletin article in which, it is suggested, Crick
had a finger. The Bulletin doesn’t want to spoil
sport, but it assures Dean’s solicitor that the
article presumably referred to was an unsuggested
expression of the honest opinions of a working-
journalist who doesn’t know Crick from a crow.
At length Melbourne City Council has
adopted the minimum wage, or, at least, three
minimums—one for boys under 18, one for men
under 55, and another for men over the latter age.
This arrangement provides for the “ pore old
man ” for whom councillors have always expressed
so much concern, and leaves the rascally con-
tractor all the loop-holes he could wish for where-
by to get his men at boys’ wages or pay them as
victims of old age and general debility. It will
be found that the corporation laborer of the future
will never be older than 18 till he suddenly
becomes 55.
Set a cableliar to catch a cableliar. The
Age lately bowled out the Argus manufacturing
fiscal facts in the fablegrams to make comment
for the leading articles. The Age forgets its own
doctoring of the cricket-news, so as to tone down
Australian defeats in London, etc., etc. The fact
is that too much prominence altogether is given
to the imaginative expansion of cabled hints from
London, and the member of the cable syndicate
that takes special pains to separate the inferences
from the facts, will do a great deal to abolish the
what-will-they-say-in-England feeling that dis-
courages some alleged Australians from the cradle
to the grave.
At Sydney School of Arts, the other day,
Gov. Hampden in a speech mainly about Austra-
lian literature :
We lived in these days in such hurry and excitement
that our every-day life, and especially the every-day life
of those actively engaged in the settlement of a land, was
not such as to provide the conditions for a high standard
of literature. The press was admirably conducted, but
he did not suppose that the most enthusiastic pressman
would say that the daily press itself was likely to raise the
standard of literature. The man who was engaged on the
press had to think more of producing facts than of the
style in which he produced them. Yet, even in that
matter, he was struck very much since coming here by
the admirable literary work in one of the weekly news-
papers. It was produced in such a way as not to strike
most readers, because it was not in the body of the paper,
but on the fly-sheet. However, he was not going to
mention names. (Laughter).
H.E.’s allusion to The Bulletin was gall and
wormwood to a lot of people, and Daily Tele-
graph was the only newspaper which had the
nerve and the grace to report this portion of the
Governor’s remarks.
Be the Colonial Bank and Ward Farmers’
Association muddle, the Seddon Government has
been moved to appoint a Parliamentary committee
to inquire into the amalgamation of the. Colonial
and B.N.Z.—with a view to proving that it was
not done to help Treas. Ward out of his difficulties
or for any other corrupt motive. The first com-
mittee proposed consisted of Premier Seddon,
Minister M'Kenzie (to inquire into their own con-
duct), three Government supporters and three
Tories—altogether, five Ministerialists to three
Oppositionists. The Opposition refused to take a
hand unless the numbers were equal. Then the
matter was referred to the House, and as the
Opposition finally refused to take a hand at all,
the committee is to be all Ministerialists. Con-
sidering that the archangel Gabriel couldn’t make
the report of such a committee look absolutely
unbiased, it would have been a great deal better
to leave the politicians out of the business alto-
gether and let three judges tackle the matter.
Another way would have been to simply say that,
up to date, there was nothing to disprove, and the
Government didn’t require whitewashing, and
have no committee at all. As matters are the
Government is in a cul-de-sac. The Opposition
refused to be represented, and yet it will point out
for ever afterwards that because it wasn’t repre-
sented the whole business was a farce. Just here
news comes along that the M.L. Council has
appointed a committee of its own, which is prac-
tically all Opposition, so the fact that the matter
should have been severely left alone sticks out
more and more.
The linotype record has been raised by
Barney Mensing, of St. Louis, U.S.A., to 148,200
“ ens ” in seven hours.
The many friends of Mr. G. A. Stockfeld,
the well - known Australian gold - prospector,
rumored to have been killed in Matabeleland*
have been much relieved by news that he is safe
with his party (including more than one young
Sydneyite) in Fort Salisbury.
Miss Jessie Ackerman, grand priestess of
the Women’s Christian Temperance Union of
U.S., just returned from the East, is “pained to
admit that she believes the evangelisation of China
to be a hopeless task. ” What a slap in the eye
for the missions ! And what a corroboration of
Morrison !
Q. Govt.’s approval of Judge Windeyer’s
suggested elevation to the Privy Council is an-
nounced. This makes the fourth convict-province
administration said to be more-or-less favorable to
the idea. The Govts, of Victoria and S.A.—the
only Australian provinces never officially recog-
nised as convict settlements — are warm in opposi-
tion. Hm !
At latest advices, Premier Turner, of Vic-
toria, had peremptorily demanded from N.S.W.
Premier Reid particulars of those 121 articles
which the latter declares are supplied by Govern-
ment contractors in Sydney at less than half Mel-
bourne rates. Therefore, the chances are that
Premier Reid, who has kept very dark about the
particulars so far, will shortly be sorry he spoke.
A Bulletin correspondent: — Will Capt.
Neitenstein, who formally declined to receive
aboriginal boys among his white charges on the
Sobraon, even when those boys were ordered to
the training-ship by Stipendiaries, adhere, now
that he is Comptroller-General of N.S.W. Prisons,
to the same color-line in respect to adults ? Black
boys and white boys should be jointly as malleable
under the hand of discipline as black men and
white men.
In reply to The Bulletin’s queries re
Sydney civil ambulance and transport brigade,
Herbert J. Page writes that the Govt, grants
premises and some ambulance appliances.
The brigade is supported by voluntary contribu-
tions. Nearly 200 cases have been dealt with
since commencing operations, and the brigade is
ready night or day to render first aid to the in-
jured and transport to the hospital if necessary ;
no charge being madeffor services. The premises
and records are open to inspection.
Ebenezer Ward, M.L.C. (S.A.), has pitched
a cunningly-fashioned stumbling-block into the
pathway of Chief-Justice Way’s possibility of
Privy Councillorship ( versus Windeyer). Said
Ebenezer in effect: “If Way is appointed to the
judicial bench of the P.C., Kingston will take the
S.A. Chief Justiceship, and just fancy Charley
ex-footballer, ex-full-private, ex-would-be-
duellist, &c., &c., Chief-Justice ! ” It is quite
possible that Kingston, having been a man of
warm blood and having graduated feelingly
through a few very human follies, would make a
first-class, common-sense Chief Justice; but, all
the same, Ebenezer’s presentment is artfully
painted and baited.
A know-nothing male having introduced
into M.L. Parliament a Bill to give servant girls
a weekly half-holiday, Lady Stout (the lady who
publicly believes in Chinese immigration) brought
down this resolution to a more or less Tory
meeting :
That the members of the Southern Cross Society wish to
draw the attention of Mr. Kelly to the urgent necessity of
providing a half-holiday for mothers of families who have
no servants, and who never get a rest night or day, and
would suggest that a Bill which provided" for this urgent
need, by compelling the husbands to remain at home and
mind the house and children while their wives take an
airing, would be hailed as a boon by many hard-working
and deserving women, (Laughter.)
The new Hotel Cecil, London, which has
by now opened its doors, is only exceeded in size
by one other in the world— viz. , the Palace at San
Francisco. There are 700 bedrooms, and 3CO
sitting-rooms. The decorations of all the apart-
ments are sumptuous. The place is being run in
the first instance by the liquidator in Hobbs’
estate, but no doubt it will presently pass into the
hands of one or other of the big hotel go’s. The
manager is Bertini,so well-known at the Criterion,
who has had world-wide experience) and the chej
is the famous Antoine Coaste.
One of the first results of Chief Justice
Madden’s decision that the police are not to con-
duct or assist in private cases in the courts of
petty sessions appeared, the other day, at South
Melbourne. The complainant was a boy, aged 10,
with a badly-damaged skull, who charged two
persons with assault. He had no means to hire a
barrister, while defendants had. Therefore the
case resolved itself into a legal conflict between a
barrister, on one side, and a 10-year-old boy, with
a broken head, conducting his own case, on the
other, and the rush of legal technicalities swept
the small plaintiff off his feet before the case was
fairly commenced. He had no brief in his hand,
no wig : he hadn’t learnt the art of glaring at the
other party, and asking questions in a deep, fierce
voice that came right from his boots ; and he was
promptly badgered out of court.
At Colling wood, the other day, a swag-
bearing, begging vagrant was found to have in his
“ drum ” seven boxes of matches, 3 yds. black
pudding, 7 loaves, several dozen paper “screws
of tea and sugar, a lump of butter without a
wrapper, an elastic-side boot, a piece of mouldy
cheese, a stale cabbage, a cauliflower, a skinned
rabbit, some beef-steak, a pair of trousers, and
several shirts, socks and handkerchiefs. Evi-
dently he was going to make Irish stew, of the
ordinary boarding-house sort, when the police
interrupted him. There were 20 previous con-
victions. Six months’hard.
The United States, after a trial of a,
slightly reduced tariff, are evidently going back to
the most aggravated kind of protection. It is
fully evident that the Republican party will win
the Presidential election, and what it means to do
with its victory is sufficiently shown by the nomi-
nation, by a stupendous majority, of M‘Kinley,
the most advanced Protectionist in American
politics, as the party’s candidate for president.
So the Sydney Telegraph* which used to whoop
about the glorious Freetrade resurrection tha.
wasn’t coming in U.S., now drops the painful
subject, and waded in the other day to show that
the overthrow of the old Macdonald party in
Canada means that Freetrade is Actively coming
along there, and must triumph all over the world
sooner or later. Hope deferred, &c.

Vic. Govt, allows public servants to attend

‘ ‘ Why should a man elected by the ‘ Prop-
putty ’ vote be more Honorable than one elected

Premier Reid is now in his 23rd month of
office. He was given a mere three-months’ tether
at the start. “ Threatened men live long.”
When is the report on Mr. “ Tom ” Slat-

Melb. Argus declares that Socialism would
mean that the community would be “saddled
with the maintenance of all who cannot or will
not sustain themselves.” A very fair description
of things as they now are.
S.A. Oppositionists are reported to be far
from a happy family just now, owing to a social-
scandal incident the report of which was somehow
suppressed in S.A. Hansard and the daily papers,
although hinted at in Melb. Age.
Premier Forrest says Westralian delegates
will attend the coming Federal Convention —even
if he has to nominate them himself. No labor of
nomination is too great for Premier Forrest to
undergo in the interests of the Commonwealth.
Study Wrixon, played out in Vic. Assem-
bly, is a candidate for the vault to the Council.
Time was when people thought him the only
possible man for Speaker, Chief-Justice—and
Premier. But he married too much money too
early in life.
V. L. Solomon, one of Kingston’s ablest
opponents in last S. A. Parliament, rarely appears
in the new Assembly. Copley’s election as Oppo-
sition leader is believed to be the reason. “ Sol ”
is a good financier and an able speaker, and would
have made a stronger leader than Copley, who is
a wind-bag and personally unpopular.
The extradition

Geake, plus the .£lOO

It is a wonder that
no lawyer down South
has yet dared to ques-
tion the validity of the
Vic. Constitution Act.
He might thus readily
brush away some ob-
noxious Act which
stands in his client’s
way, or, at least,- get
that long delay which
is often as good as vic-
tory in a bad case.
Jenks, in his “Govern-
ment of Victoria,”
points out the peculiar
circumstances of its
birth, and really que-
ries whether it was
“born in the purple.”
And Higinbotham’s
no ;e in the consoli dated
acts to the effect that
the act is supposed to
be in force by reason
of being schedule (1) of
an English statute, is
most significant. As a
matter of fact, the Bill,
as agreed upon in Vic-
toria, was afterwards
mutilated byDowning-
street officials and
shoved in that form
into an English sche-
dule. It was then
assented to by the
Queen in a form to
which, apparently, pre-
vious statutes did not
authorise her to assent,
and turned loose on
Victoria. There were
objections raised, but
the ipse dixit of two
or three influential in-
dividuals silenced them
all.
The perky Russell-Jones’s motion in the
N.S.W. Assembly that members’ salaries be re-
duced from .£3OO to £l5O is obviously the outcome
of his own aggressive modesty. Jones evidently
feels, like everyone else, that he isn’t worth £3OO
a year to the country.
A Bill to authorise women to sit in Parlia-
ment, or to hold any public office or position what-
soever, is before Maoriland Legislature. It may
not pass just yet, but it is bound to come sooner
or later. The woman politician is the natural
result of the woman voter.
The other day an aboriginal deputation
approached Q. Labor-leader Glassey. Thus the
spokesman:—“ Lars year I get ’em little pfeller
blankit; plenty hole. This year baal me get ’em
any blanket. What b Gubament got agin
me ? S’pose I get no blankit next time, I come no
more, but go longa Missa Jack Hoolan, and, by
cripes, bust ’em up Labor-party ! ”
Hancock’s protest against the sale of metal
broken in Melb. Gaol is not much called for. The
prison output for the past six months only
amounted to £I3G, and “honest labor” would be
none the better off if the metal were supplied to
municipalities gratis. The question is, shall pri-
soners put in a little useful work? If so, some-
thing must be done with the result.
S.M. Herald considers Parliament should
invent a means of suppressing or moderating the
present method of questioning Ministers in Parlia-
ment. As the revelations re the professional
charges in the Dean Commission were squeezed
from Ministers by the pertinacious questioning
the present practice allows, the Herald’s sud-
denly-displayed desire for a change admits of
malicious interpretation.
Premier Reid (proudly) : ‘ ‘ The whole ex-
penditure out of the Treasurer’s advance account
for 11 months of the year was only £10,000.” The
figures show that the expenditure for 12 months
was £26,000, so Mr. Reid speaks only of 11
months. This quaint way of never telling the
whole truth is a political characteristic of G.
Reid. The reduction to £26,000 is something to
be proud of, but even when he is in the right
G.R. can’t tell the whole truth about it.
The Vic. Government scheme for State
relief to the poor—in other words, for establishing
the British Poor Rate in Australia —knocks one
great Australian legend on the head. Up to date
Australia has tried to believe that there is no per-
manent poverty in the country—only temporary
want of employment ; and the State has been
giving temporary relief for 40 years, and charging
it mostly to loan-funds, and professing to believe
that everything will be right next year. _ There
have been relief works, and private subscriptions,
and a “ charitable vote ” almost as long as any-
body can remember, but any formal recognition
of permanent poverty has been carefully avoided.
Now it is coming, and it is just as well that it
should, so that the Australian may understand
where his country has got to and not keep his
head buried in the sand any longer.
FILIAL LOYALTY v. TRUTH.
GOOD OLD TEMPERANCE PARTY : “ Well, Johnnie, how's father— does he

JOHNNIE: “ Yes, sir—er—sometimes, sir!"

Cablegram: “Desperate lighting has oc-

bravery.” On the present occasion the British
won so it would seem that they fought still more
devilishly than the devds above-mentioned,

Gov. Hampden, when in Melbourne last
week, accepted a seat on the floor of the Leg.
Assembly one business night. The last distin-
guished N.S.W. man who accepted that honor
was Ninian Melville in the days of his Chairman-
ship of Committees. The late Parkes was invited
to the floor on his last flying trip, but he said
“ No ” with such emphasis that members thought
of repudiating all future overtures towards Feder-
ation.
The situation of the unhappy Mrs. Kil-
patrick’s case against Huddart Parker and Co. up
to date is something like this: (1) There were the
usual preliminary proceedings before the first
trial, and the necessary costs; (2) there was the
first trial and the necessary costs ; (3) application
by defendants for second trial, and third batch of
costs; (4) second trial, and fourth batch of costs ;
(5) application by defendants to Full Court for
third trial (fifth batch of costs); (6) application by
defendants to Full Bench of Judges for third trial
(sixth batch of costs); (7) application by defend-
ants for leave (granted) to appeal to Privy Council
(seventh batch of costs) ; (8) appeal, which will
presently ensue, to Privy Council, and eighth
batch of costs. What a lot of law there is m
Australia for the rich litigant!
N S.W. Postmaster-General Cook wants
to shunt the unemployed and the victims of the
sweater upon “the Churches.” Before the
saintlv Joseph was a “God-fearing Minister
and a haltered Reidite, he was a Labor-leader
and a lay-preacher among the Lithgow miners,
on their unionism and his reputation for Godliness.
Then oh ' then, he wanted to dump the unem-
ployed and the “ sweated ” on to the Legislature.
That gained him a passport into the Legislature,
and into the high places of profit and power ; and
now oh ! now, he wants to dump his marketing
stock elsewhere—on to the Churches, on to any-
thing anywhere, so long as it isn’t the Legislature
that shelters Joseph.
It will remain to be seen whether the seasons, which so
lamentably failed us in the final year of Protection, will
stand by us in the first year of Freetrade. That rests m
mightier hands than Mr. Reid’s.— Sydney Daily Tele-
graph.
That is to argue that the Almighty is a Free-
trader ! Which can hardly be thrust down the
throat of a people that calls itself a Christian com-
munity, and brags that it borrowed its Divinity
from the Hebrews ; for wasn’t the God of Abra-
ham, Isaac and Jacob distinguished for His par-
tiality to a “peculiar people,” and didn’t He
variously “protect” that race, besides specially
legislating for the shipbuilding industry in the
time of Noah? It is late in the day, and a reversal
of orthodoxy, to claim God Almighty as a
Foreign-trader.
Melb. Age warmly recommends Righteous
Wrixon to re-enter public life and become an
ornament of Vic. Leg. Council. Loth the
and Argus remain grateful to Wrixon for his Bill
to prevent the publication of a Sunday newspaper
in Melbourne, and they never miss a chance tc
praise his broad mind and impartial sentiments,
One good turn deserves another. The Sunday
paper might have developed into a daily rival.

Ex-Treas. Ward’s speech in his own defence
in M.L. Parliament was to have been circulated
in pamphlet form, but fear of libel-law came
in. A speech published in Hansard is privileged,
but if reprinted as an extract the privilege dis-
appears. Ward got over the difficulty by giving
a special order for several thousand extra copies of
Hansard, which were duly supplied at cost-price
by an obliging Government. And of such is the
kingdom of politics.
Premier Reid in his financial statement :
From 1871 to 1891 the total trade of Victoria increased
by £10,800,000, or 40 per cent. During the same period
the total trade of New South Wales increased _ by
£30,500,000, or 146 per cent., much more than three times
the Victorian increase.
The inference is obvious and the figures are abso-
lutely true. But what a different impression
could be produced by selecting some other equally
true figures from the same table ! For instance :
“From 1891 to 1893 the total trade of N.S.W.
decreased £10,300,000, while that of Victoria only
decreased £9,100,000. In 1894 the trade of N.S.W.
decreased £5,000,000, while that of Victoria re-
mained stationary.” The beauty of figures depends
mainly on careful selection. G. Reid's shipping
figures are cooked much the same way. “In Vic-
toria,” he says, “the mail steamers are counted
four times, while in N.S.W. they are only counted
once.” The fact that a steamer is reckoned twice
at every port —inwards and outwards—doesn’t
enter into the Premier’s commercial knowledge.
The mail steamers are reckoned four times at
Melbourne and twice at Sydney, just as interpro-
vincial boats, which go no further than Melbourne,
are reckoned twice there and four times at
Sydney.
The Voice of One crying in N.S.W.
Assembly, the other night, asked Premier Reid—
“ Why don’t you drop Jack Want ? ” Reid:
“ I would rather lose a good many people than the
Attorney-General.” The whole congregation will
stand, please, and chant:—

GEO. REID IN HIS GREAT SPECIALITY.— THE SURPLUS - INCUBATION TRICK
FAKER REID : “And then, ladies and gentlemen, I shall cause it to disappear as mysteriously as it came. This I call my great Exhibition Trick. Before I get through with
it, may I trouble some one in the audience for a loan of a couple of millions or so?"


Dr. Talmag-e’s Latest.
A recent quotation from this eloquent, earnest
is worthy perusal and reflection. He
says : “ Almost everybody has some defective
spot in his physical constitution; a dull ear or a
dim eye, or a rheumatic foot, or a neuralgia brow,
or a twisted muscle, or a weak side, or an inflamed
tonsil, or some point at which the east wind or a
season of overwork assaults him.” “ I was suffer-
ing,” writes Mr. H. Glenister, a prominent
George-street, Sydney business man, “ from acute
disease of the kidneys, followed by dropsy, and
was under no less than seven doctors for two years,
being in bed throughout this time. They each
pronounced my case hopeless, and I was then ad-
vised to try Warner’s Safe Cure as a last resource,
which I did, together with Warner’s Safe Pills,
and after a few bottles I received such wonderful
benefit as to be able to resume business. My case
is a well-known one in Sydney, and all my friends
consider the result simply miraculous. It is with
feelings of sincere gratitude that I write saying
what wonderful relief Warner’s Safe Cure has
given me.”*

About the
end of Sept, next
Queen Victoria,
if she still lives,
will break George
111. ’s record and
score the longest
reign in British
history. The oc-
casion will pro-
bably be cele-
brated by a dis-
tribution of
“honors,” there-
fore every Aus-
tralian Minister
who wants one
is hereby incited
to hold on to his
billet with his
hands and feet
and his best shop
teeth till the aus-
picious occasion
arrives. James
B. Patterson got
his “ honor ” by
postponing till
after Victoria’s
birthday came
along the meet-
ing of the Parlia-
ment which was
yearning to
throw him out.
Then the As-
sembly met and
ejected James, K. C. M. G., on his ear, and he
went out smiling-. And then he died. There
are four Australasian Prenders who haven’t yet
been thunder blasted with the awful decoration
of St. M. and St. G., and next September their
chance to commit political suicide may arrive.
The quiet release of “banker” Staples
from gaol, and the private influence brought to
bear thereon, will be discussed in Vic. Assembly,
unless the apostles of “ Hush ! ” can prevail.
There is something pathetic but character-
istic in the fact that the President of Melb. Trades
Hall for the year (Mr. E. Pinley) is an out-of-work
compositor, a former Herald man, deposed by the
linotype.
The father of Daniel Cooper, Bart.,
K.C.M.G., owner of almost untold acres of
Sydnej' and suburban property, in the early
twenties, kept a bakery at the corner of Park and
George streets.
If the alleged Sydney forger who has so
blankly disappeared has really succeeded in getting
away from Australia, he very likely went in
female attire. With proper make-up, he would
have made a rather convincing woman.
M.L. mine-speculator Ziman a few months
ago advertised himself by planking down .£lOOO
towards the cost of a £200,000 battleship to be
presented to England; but as no one came forward
with the other £199,000, the £lOOO goes to Reefton
charities,
An Acting-Judge, whose sentences are
characterised by marked severity, has, an obser-
vant barrister lately pointed out, nine chances to
one for a permanent appointment on any Bench in
Australia over the Acting-Judge who tempers
justice with mercy.
A Melbourne bibliophile has a copy of
Browning’s “Bordello,” first edition, inscribed,
“to his dear friend, R. H. Horne, from R. 8.”
He gave fourpence for this treasure, which he
found in a local bookseller’s cheap box some years
Bince. It would fetch pounds now.
Ex-attorney Meagher, it is announced, is
going to lecture on crime and criminals, including
Archer, Lee and Cummins, Williams and Mont-
gomery, and others. The humor of the thing is
that the voluble attorney more or less defended
them all, and they were all carefully hanged.
Like most old sea-dogs of high position,
Vice-Admiral Tryon, a conspicuous figure in
Sydney a few years ago and later on tragically
drowned, has left a pious memory behind, and the
other day the church of his native Northampton
unveiled a monument to commemorate his virtues.
Attorney John Madden, Chief Justice
Madden’s father, estimates that, in half a cen-
tury’s hunting, he has only been down two or
three hundred times. George Watson more. Yet
within about a twelvemonth young Mrs. Highett,
young Bygate, young Manifold, and young
M'Murtrie have been slain.
King O’Malley, the Yankee insurance
drummer and M.P., is one of the new oratori-
cal terrors of S.A. Parliament. O’Malley, an
alleged democrat, says he “ will never take his
foot off the necks of the gilded spurred roosters
while they fatten on the poor man’s corn crib.”
He was once editor and proprietor of the Grey
Gulch (Cal.) Fighter.
The black-mailing charge on which Austin
Kirby, the absconding M.L. detective, has been
committed for trial, was raked up by an ex-oon-
stable, discharged from the service at the instiga-
tion of Kirby a few years ago. Mr. Justice John-
ston reckoned Kirby the smartest man in the
Force it was he who so adroitly investigated the
ease of Hall, the Timaru poisoner, in ’B6.
A very, very gilded Australian lady, who
is pestered out of her life by all manner of charity-
seekers and fortune-hunters (same thing), knows
how to give a straight hint on occasion—as a curly-
headed society youth lately discovered. At a
recent big ball, his attentions had grown painful
both to onlookers and recipient. “It is most kind
of you to attend on me like this, Mr. ,” said
Miss at last, “ but I’m sure nothing will
come of it.”
General Hutton, when in command of the
N.S.W. forces, was never “stuck” for an oath,
but as he publicly cursed only the officers (he used
to apologise to them in private) he was not un-
popular with the rank-and-file. Colonel Tom
Price, in command of the Vic. Mounted Rifles, is
alleged to curse both officers and pri vates on
parade, but he struck a snag at Hamilton, Vic.,
the other day. The local Spectator alludes to his
language in blistering terms.

A MARRIED MASH.
"That tall gentleman was so attentive a few minutes ago, but he won't look at me now”
"Yes! that's my husband —he must have seen me come in!”
Novelist B. L. Farjeon, in his novel “ The
House of White Shadows,” published 11 years
ago, in a measure anticipated the Dean-Meagher
embroglio. The plot deals with an advocate who
takes up the defence of an alleged murderer and
secures his acquittal. Immediately afterwards
the accused confesses his guilt to the advocate
who decides to keep the secret, with the result
that he and the murderer “go under,” but in a
more dramatic fashion than “Possum ” Dean and
Meagher.
Ex-Governor Read, of Darlinghurst Gaol,
once had sent to him on approval a warder with
such a lazy style that Read sene a warder proper
to bring a chair. The chair having arrived he
calmly told the man to be seated, as chairs were
always provided for the weary. The tired warder
innocently accepted the seat, much to the
amusement of gaolers and gaoled, but next day
he left the service for ever.
Though it was denied, on publication in
London Daily Gourier, that Prince Persimmon
had benefited to the amount of a million by
Baron Hirsch’s death, the statement was never-
theless true (writes a London correspondent to
The Bulletin). Two-fifths were hard cash, and
the remainder cancelled obligations. The Duke
°f York also reaped a share of the harvest repre-
senting at least half a million.
J. T. Hogan—who, as “ our London cor-
respondent, is allowed to tell the tale of his own
deeds in -Mel b. Herald —relates what he terms a
funny story in which he figures. When the Colo-
nial Marriage Bill was before the Commons, it
was opposed by Lord Hugh Cecil, and several
members, not having read it, asked what it was
all about. “ Oh,” said a member, “it is a Bill to
enable Hogan to have a wife in every colony.”
A much-mentioned and recently-retrenched
N.b.W. civil-servant some years ago was addicted
to looking upon the rum when it was red, and at
one hotel made himself such a nuisance that at
last the landlord told him he would be served
there no more. He disappeared for half an hour
and re-appeared in the bar dripping wet : he had
gone upstairs and taken a bath with all his cloth-
ing on, boots and hat included. He called for a
dr. llk, and, holding the glass up, said : “This is
the last drink I’m going to have,” and, up to date,
he has kept his word.
31elb. : “ Nick Fitzgerald, M.L.A., had an
oratoriego-i n the other night at the Humane Society,
sandwiched between Govs. Hampden and Brassey
and blazing them both out into darkness visible
with his bit of fireworkery. Nicholas always
reminds one of the kind of horse-races known as
the Shorts, Hurry-Scurry, and Helter-Skelter.
He bolts off at a terrific bat, with a glorious
sludge-flow not unlike eloquence, but cracks up
all at once, as a rocket bursting in blue fires or
a golden shower. All is portico, no edifice, and
he ends just when you expect him to begin.”
Poor old Jawbone Neild appeared on the
platform again the other night in Sydney and
raged furiously for over an hour—mostly about
the people who didn’t appreciate his ' alleged
poems. The general burden of his lament was
that he treated these people with silent contempt
After one terrific storm and bang-crash of denun-'
ciation, however, he mentioned that his critics
were vipers who wrote falsehoods for bread ”
which is a beautiful figure of speech, anyhow.
But it goes to show that Neild doesn’t understand
the press. That kind of viper writes falsehoods
for whisky, and finds the bread on the free-lunch
counter.

N.S.W. Ex-Sheriff Cowper’s ebullient as-
sault on the majesty of his political surroundings
before his chair of office had actually grown cold
shows the thinness of the Civil Service crust under
which many public-spirited men pass seemingly
contented lives. But, ebullient as Cowper now is
he manifestly possessed more horse-sense than
Sydneys first Sheriff, John M'Kaness, who in
less than two years after his appointment, under-
took to play the part of independent public man,
and was incontinently cashiered. Cowper has
drawn official salary and successfully held his
tongue for 27 consecutive years, during which the
country must have been going to the Devil quite
as fast as it is going now.
A REVIVAL .
This gentleman informs us that his business
is LOOKING UP.
“Find the woman in the case.’' Cecil
Rhodes s latest freaks, especially the Jameson
raid, are now attributed to the desperation of a
disappointed man. Less than a year ago Rhodes
offered his hand and wealth to the still-
beautiful Dowager Countess of Dudley (sister
of the Prince of Wales’s friend, the historical
Lady Mordaunt, and mother of. young Lord
Dudley, who visited Australia in the Car-
mgton days). He was rejected, and since
his rebuff the “uncrowned king ” has become ten-
fold more reserved and arrogant than before, and
has disclosed a capacity for blundering equalled by
few. His erstwhile friends predict, as a result of
his present “ tight place,” either a tragic termina-
tion to his life, or the initial steps towards the
United States of South Africa, with himself as
President.
Brighton (IMelb.) proposes to make atone-
ment for its old-time rejection of Higinbotham in
favor of dear Tom Bent, by starting a monument
to the memory of the late Chief Justice—
When Higinbotham shone on earth
The Brighton voters scorned his worth
(May Heaven be their pardoner !)
And “chucked ’im” for a candidate
Who served their suburb, not the State-
Tom Bent, a market gardener.
But now that Higinbotham’s dead
They say to him they chose instead—
“ Our blessing isn’t on you, Bent.”
Disdainful of that bluffer bold,
They deem the man he beat of old
Deserving of a monument.
Set up a marble statue white,
Upon its base this record write—
“ From Senate we ejected him,
’Midst brutal shouts of rude applause,
And bade him stop away because
We honored and rejected him.”
Higinbotham’s monument is builded. Brighton
had better attend to the wants of Tom Bent:
A monument the chieftain owns;
None fairer mankind knows—
*Tis builded strongly of the stones
Thrown at him by his foes.

July Cosmos appears with Alex. Mont-
gomery as editor. Cosmos has undergone such
remarkable vicissitudes lately that ’tis wonder it
survived at all, and the new number is handi-
capped way behind scratch. Allowing for the
handicap, COSMOS begins to show something of the
potentialities which lurk in an Australian Maga-
zine. D. J. Quinn crystallises some good impres-
sions of the N.S.W. bar ; the editor chats agree-
ably with Dion Boueicault; P. J. Holdsworth is
represented by some sonorous verse, and Ethel
Turner by a sad little child-story; and Louise
Mack continues her serial. There are sundry ex-
cellent portraits and illustrations.
A Sydney writer speculates whether
the sheriff, 'if he actually hanged felons
with his own hands, would be shunned by his
friends and neighbors. “ I think not,” is the con-
clusion. The Bulletin maintains that the
sheriff, if he personally acted as hangman, would
have the social status of a hangman. _ The
Bulletin has seen the sheriff waltzing with a
lady at a public ball. Where is the woman who
would have her waist encircled publicly by a man
who had been cold-bloodedly choking a woman for
a fee ! Let the hangman be set down in his own
loathsome place. Even now the office of sheriff
finds scant respect in many quarters. There is a
legend about a sheriff who, while on backblock
circuit, found that a room in the court-house was
being used by a roads-and-bridges engineer as a
temporary office. ‘ Tell that ah ! roads man
that he’ll have to find an office elsewhere,
said the sheriff to the tipstaff. Whereupon tho
engineer, overhearing, called out:' “You tell that
ah ! damned hangman to go to blazes. ”

ABRIDGED REPORT.
Melbourne, 12th June, 1896.
The Directors Bonnie Doon Gold-mining Company.
Gentlemen, —
Acting in accordance with your instructions, I duly pro'
ceeded to your property, known as the Bonnie Doon
Gold-mining Company, 'and after a lengthy visit in
thoroughly examining and testing all the known reefs
and veins opened up to present, have now the honor to
lay before you the following detailed report
ACREAGE and LOCALITY.
The property is situated at Siberia, about 65 miles
north-east of Coolgardie, and consists of six 12-acre
blocks—72 acres in all —numbered respectively 615, 2407,
2468 (formerly 418), 2595, 2593; and 2594. Block 615, upon
which the main workings are located, immediately adjoins
on the south-east the once famous Christie’s Reward
claim, from which a vast amount of alluvial gold and
dollying stone was obtained in the early history of the
field.
MEANS of COMMUNICATION.
The main Siberia road runs directly through the eastern
portion of the property. It is in a good state of repair,
and affords excellent means of communication with and
transport of material from Coolgardie. A large number of
teamsters are at present availing themselves "of this route
to Menzies in preference to proceeding via the 90-Mile. On
the completion of the Coolgardie-Menzies line you will be
within 17 miles of the 45 siding, so no difficulty as far as
transport of machinery and material is concerned will
ever be experienced.
LODES AND THEIR FEATURES.
So far shafts and costeens of various depths have been
opened up on 10 makes of stone, but as all of these are
not of a continuous character, some being irregular lenti-
cular veins with no proof positive of downward continuity
and others only “ break heaves ” from other v ins, I shail
therefore deal first with those I consider the main fissure
veins, viz. Nos. 7 (allied with 6), No. 8, and the water
shaft formation.
No. 6. —No. 6 is the reef or vein from which some fabu-
lously rich stone was taken some time ago. It has a west-
north-west by east-south-east strike, or within a few
points of east and west. It has an underlie north with a
dip to the east. A vertical shaft has been sunk to a dis-
tance 65ft., passing through the golden stone on its dip
east at 15ft. Here a small cut was put in, and some
excellent ore obtained, namely, that exhibited in Mel-
bourne a few months ago. The stone at this point is
about 15in. thick, and still carries fair gold, but the shoot
is fast dipping away east. The quartz appears to have
laminated bands of vesicular ferruginous stone running
through it at intervals, and whenever this occurs good
coarse specimen gold is obtained. The stone will vary a
great deal in its gold-bearing proclivities, as well as in its
conformation and regularity. In the various pan tests I
made I was particularly careful in eschewing any material
that had a tendency to specimen-stone. The results ob-
tained gave an average return of 2oz. to the ton, with loz.
sdwt. per ton from the rubble schist alongside the hang-
ing wall. There is thus about 2ft. 6in. of payable crushing
material. The footwall is composed of grey felspathic
material intermixed with soft diorite, the hanging wall of
grey and brown diorite. After testing the formation at
the 15ft. level the shaft was continued down to its present
depth, 65ft., connection being made at 40ft. with No. 7
underlie shaft a few feet north-east therefrom. I shall
treat further on this reef after describing No. 7, and ‘the
views that I hold with regard to its probable action at
point of dip contact with the other body (7).
No. 7. —This reef is one of the three permanent fissure
bodies on your property, and was first opened up in a
trench about 40ft. north-east of No. 6. It is about 3ft.
wide, and is composed chiefly of dark ferruginous quartz.
It is commonly known as a north and south reef, but its
actual bearing or strike is north 10 degrees west. It has
an easterly underlie, with a dip to the south-east. An
underlie shaft has been carried down on the back of the
reef to a depth of about 65ft., when it crossed the No. 6
shaft at about 40ft. vertical from the surface. At about
55ft. down the underlie shaft an underlie winze was sunk
on the stone to a depth of 25ft. The reef here still main-
tains its uniform width, and is enclosed between nice-
looking soft micaceous and kaolin schists. The width of
the formation including veinstone is about 18ft. The
over and sublying rock is hard blue diorite. The average
result of stone taken from the reef representing a length
of nearly 85ft. gave the magnificent average return of
4540 z. per ton of a splendid sample of both coarse and
fine gold. The schist also carries an appreciable amount
of gold, and I would advise that your manager send a
couple cwt. for bulk treatment in Melbourne.
No. 6 (Continued).—Close to breaking through from
No. 7 to No. 6, the track of the latter reef is seen under-
lying directly on to the back of No. 7. This traek is
about 2ft. wide, the walls being filled in with kaolin
schist, and diorite with a thin vein of gold-bearing stone
on the footwall. This is only the tail end of the stone
west, the main shoot having dipped east as previously ex-
plained, but the question arises what will be the ultimate
fate of No. 6 on its point of dip contact with No. 7
further south-east ? That No. 7is a permanent fissure I
am assured of, therefore I can only conclude that No. 6
must eventually give way to the more masterly body, but
what its terminal point of existence may be it is im-
Prospectus.
possible to say. Itmay not be for some considerable depth,
for with each successive south-east shoots of stone coming
into point of dip contact you will have longer lengths to
work on. No. 6, therefore, in my opinion, will continue
for some considerable time to come to yield quantities of
good payable ore of given quantities at given distances
apart. If the vertical shaft was continued down to, say,
75ft. or 100 ft., and a crosscut driven north-east, it would
test both Nos. 6 and 7 at one of the points of dip contact.
I would strongly recommend this work be undertaken.
No. 8 (a) is another masterly body, and one of the main
fissures of your mine. It is distant about 200 ft. north-
east from No. 6. Its angle of bearing is about north
25deg. west, with a south-west underlie. It was first
opened up in a trench about 90ft. long, the stone being
from 14in. to 15in. thick. Towards the north end of the
trench a small blind shaft has been sunk on the stone to a
depth of 10ft., and proved good payable ore to exist. To
the south a vertical shaft has been sunk to a depth of
50ft., the reef carrying down in like manner to about 42ft.,
when the stone began to assume an underlie, and subse-
quently bifurcated or split into two branches, one branch
going off very fast to the west, the other continuing at a
more vertical angle. Sinking was continued on the hang-
ing-wall or western branch for a further Bft., and then
drives were put in approximately north-west and south-
east on the course of the vein for distances of 16ft. and
18ft. respectively. In the south-east end over the back
the stone is about 2ft. wide, and in the face 3ft. The
stone has a most pleasing appearance, is granular in tex-
ture, slightly ferruginous in composition, and appears to
lie in laminated floors. The footwall vein is coming in on
the eastern side, and in the course of another few feet
should coalesce and form a large body of stone. In the
north-west end the stone has risen over the back, indicat-
ing the dip in the other or south-east direction. The two
branches here are about sft. apart, and the diversion will
increase in this direction, so it would not be advisable to
continue the north-west end on this vein any further at
present unless to rise up for stoping purposes. The en-
closing walls throughout consist of decomposed diorite
and schist. Samples taken along each drive and face
gave the average handsome return of 3|oz. coarse and fine
gold per ton.
No. 8B is an underlie shaft, 40ft. south-east of the
former one, and is apparently sunk on an offshoot vein
from that body. It will, however, judging from appear-
ances, eventually join the other reef at a greater depth.
The shaft was sunk on the underlie to about 60ft., the
reef being 12in. thick throughout, and enclosed between
nice schistose country. The vein then took a vertical
turn and was followed down on that angle for a further
10ft., making total depth 70ft. The stone is similar in
character to BA, and samples 2oz. per ton. Samples
taken from the heaps at grass at both these shafts, repre-
senting about 20 tons, gave the highly gratifying result of
3oz. per ton.
WATER SHAFT DEVELOPMENT.
1 now come to a matter that has every probability of
developing into something exceedingly good, viz., the'for-
mation, as it is locally termed, lately passed through
in the water shaft. This shaft, which at time of
my visit was down a depth of 100 ft., was positioned
out for the purpose of hot only securing water,
but also at the same time for operating therefrom
on the majority of the reefs on their east dip and
strike. The site has been well selected for this double
purpose, and the shaft is being carefully sunk and well
timbered, and will answer all requirements for some time
to come. The country down to 37ft. consisted of very
hard diorite ; there the formation-change occurred. This
consists of 18ft. of micaceous and kaolin schists inter-
spersed with numerous veins and spurs of calcitic and
ferruginous quartz, all more or less of an auriferous
nature. The strike of this formation is north-west and
south-east, with a southerly underlie and an easterly dip.
Towards the south end of the shaft, where the formation
was passed through, a number of these veins coalesced
and formed a body of stone 3ft. wide. Underneath this
again was about 12in. of kaolin schist, and then the diorite
appeared and continued to the bottom. Numerous spurs
continued to be met with after the formation was passed
through, some underlying at a north-east angle, others of
a vertical disposition. Until the last few feet the
country rock has been broken and disjointed, but now
it has a distinct stratified plane, the strata striking
north-east and south-west with an apparent underlie
north, or, in other words, a transverse bearing and dip to
the formation. Three feet below the cap of formation
I took a small quantity of ferruginous quartz interspersed
with schist and obtained prospects equal to Bdwt. per
ton. From one of the vein spurs forming the 3ft. body I
obtained 16dwt. per ton, whilst from the intervening
micaceous and kaolin schists the splendid result of 2oz.
(of a coarse and fine sample of gold) per ton was given. I
am of the opinion that this formation has been formed by
the coalescence of No. 7 or 8 with some of the other east
and west veins. You will observe that with No. 7 a
similar class of schistose material occurs, and about the
same width. To prove whether No. 8 has any connection
you could further extend the south-east drive, and this
would be by no means an unproductive work, for you
would not only be raising high grade stone, but would also
be opening up the ore body for future stoping, as well as
proving the relation of 8B vein to it. I would push on
the water shaft with all possible speed, putting in open-
ing sets at 100 ft., and thence every 50ft. until you
had reached the fluid element, then would crosscut
south-east to cut the formation at the various levels,
and thus prove its continuity and value. I would
even advise that a crosscut be driven now at present
depth, but I should not discontinue sinking in order to do
so, as the striking of water is a very important matter to
you for future battery and stock purposes. lam much
impressed with the formation, and am of the belief that it
will eventuate into a highly payable body.
LEASE 2468.
This is the only other section comprised in your pro-
perty on which any work or discovery has been made.
Close to the south-east boundary, in a trench about 15ft.
long and 7ft. deep, a make of stone varying from a foot
to 15in., striking east and west underlying north, has
been opened up. The country is of a soft, earthy, dioritic
nature. The stone wears a favorable appearance and
carries a little gold, but it is impossible to say more about
it till further developed.
TIMBER.
Plenty of timber for firing purposes exists on the pro-
perty, and good sound mining timber in unlimited
quantities is procurable a mile away.
WATER CONSERVATION.
Irrespective of shaft supplies, a good catchment area
exists on your north and eastern boundaries, and a dam
could be constructed at a nominal cost.
BATTERY SITE.
An excellent milling site is obtainable close to the water
shaft, with a good get-away for the tailings.
CONCLUSION.
In concluding, it affords me great pleasure in stating
that you possess a most valuable property, which time,
perseverance and capital cannot fail to transform into a
profitable concern. You are on the eve, I believe, of a
valuable discovery in the water-shaft, and this, combined
with the excellent and permanent prospects of Nos. 7 and
8, and to a large extent 6 and 4, renders it a property
that you can conscientiously and confidently recommend
to the English investing public. All my estimates are
based on pan tests, and, therefore, necessarily under
rather than over estimated. I desire to record my thanks
to your mine manager (Mr. F. J. Friedman)‘for the
courtesy and assistance he rendered, and can testify to
the able and practical manner he is carrying on your
works.

TO MINING COMPANIES, BATTERY OWNERS
AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Fine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Treyartha’s
Patent Battery Plates.
This Invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with. The Wynne and Tregurtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs'. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased by fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple in con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

Messrs. Nicholson and Co., whose name is
ever-popular with the musical section, have, in
their portion of the splendid Equitable Buildings,
the handsomest music-shop in Australia. Spacious
as are the ground-floor, upper-floor, and basement,
they are none too ample for the firm’s require-
ments for displaying the Ronisch, the Bechstein,
the Wilmer, the Mignon, the Schiedmayer and
Soehne, the Nanon, the Challen, and other pianos •
or for comfortably accommodating the unequalled
stock of music ; or for giving the workmen in the
basement every facility for repairing. The shop-
front is a study in this form of decorative art, and
is being copied by firms of less importance. Com-
pared with other business-establishments, Messrs.
.Nicholson and Co.’s new premises are one of the
sights of Sydney. Note should be made of the
six teaching-rooms, which are not the least attrac-
tive of many praiseworthy features.*

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Dungan having won the G.N. Steeplechase,
after all, a good many people would like to know why
that- game little bit of stuff performed so feebty in the
Hurdle Race a week earlier. Since there is no possible
doubt whatever as to the honest dealing of everybody
connected with Dungan, the animal’s inconsistent run-
ning may be accounted for by a change of training tactics
between the two struggles. Perhaps he left the Hurdle
Race “ on the track,” and picked up the Steeple through
being eased in his work when he was shown to have been
somewhat overstrung. This is very likely. Anyway, the
touts were for once justified in sticking to their fancy.
Dungan, said the watchers, ought to have shaken the first
event on his “ form ” in private, and when he got beaten
they protested, with much superfluous bad language,
that he was the victim of circumstances unknown. The
public, taught by experience to believe what they see
rather than the things they hear, were right off Dungan
last Saturday, and the cheering over his victory came
mainly from early backers who had mourned their short-
priced investments as lost. Those who defer their punting
until the eleventh hour went around grumbling, under
umbrellas, at the common sense which had persuaded
them to let a good horse, owned by straight sportsmen,
go out unbacked at the tempting odds of 10 to 1.
Dondi and Timoni, as suggested by The Bul-
letin, went near to winning the Steeplechase, but old
Mikado 11. never looked dangerous. Either the veteran
has lost his pace entirely—for he fenced admirably—or
else the mud interfered with him more than it troubled
some of the others. Mikado’s friends were very confident
at the finish, and the old ’un carried a larger number of
individual sovereigns than the first favorite, Joi. Folks
in general regarded Joi as a sham idol, rushed into posi-
tion by a few big bets and a number of newspaper-writers.
Leap Year, the outsider likely to win if he
managed the first tw r o fences and got his “cronk” hind
leg into proper working order, came to grief at the second
jump. Probably Leap Year was the lamest horse that
ev r went out for a G.N. Steeple. Before they had gone
2UO yards the lightweight was running awkwardly in the
rear, but as this was merely a repetition of his display in
the Hurdle Race, where he eventually worked his waj 7 to
the front at 2.) miles, there was no telling how he might
finish—until he came an awful cropper. The Millers’ pair
—Larnook and Whernside—were the only other ones to
topple, and their bad luck, coming after The Artist’s
downfall pn the previous Saturday, gave the stable an
awful shock. Three out of four falls in the double event
happened to Mr. Sep. Miller’s colors, usually so safe.
The Sydney horse, All Right, seemed to be
winning the Open Hurdle Race from Ouyer last Saturday
up to the point where Freestep made his run. Then All
Right dropped back at a surprising rate, although Ouyen
was able to struggle on into third place, Freestep being
“ pipped ” by Billy Boy.
In a sporting sense, the damp, unpleasant
Steeplechase Day at Flemington was a big success. Very
few accidents, and three exceptionally close finishes.
Despite his third-rate Flemington effort over
small sticks, Dungan will probably be first choice for
Caulfield G.N. hurdles with only 11.10. He is not in the
four-mile steeple, which distance would suit Mikado 11.
had he not met with an accident. Songster, fourth at
Flemington, may sing a different ditty this time, and
some interest in the proceedings may be taken by Banjo
from S.A.
* * * *
Natty Dungan ? s narrow National victory recalls
the neck win of Sussex from the Panic mare Twilight the
year the steeple was inaugurated. Sussex was the first of
the Grandmasters to land a big race. Panic’s famed stock
won every item on the programme at that meeting bar
the National.
* * * *
Dungan’s heavy ballast was the third highest
borne to victory in 15 years, and Timoni was the fourth
light-weight runner-up. The grey ran a wretched third
in the two-mile Steeple at the V.R.C, June meet, when
Buzzi scored second in the Hurdles. An additional mile
suited both in the Nationals, and the light-weight double
nearly came off.
* * * *
The Miller stable contested every race on
National day. Its two reps, fell in the big event; Miss
Gladstone, winner of a double at Williamstown a fort night
previously, ran second twice ; favorite Ouyen was third in
the Hurdles, and weight anchored Dart in the Open
Steeple.
• * * *
There were some fine opportunities offered for
guessing at Warwick Farm on Saturday, when favorites
succumbed with monotonous regularity. The Captain,
Cook up, having been shunted by the public after recent
failures, duly won on a 6 to 1 chance. The first three
couldn’t get a place at Rosehill the week previous. Royal
Rose, not considered good enough for any of the spring-
handicaps, gave weight and a hot battle to the winner.
The public followed Chipping-Norton, but Patrona isn’t a
patch on her Cup-winning brother.
♦ * * *
Vic. owners are ill-represented in A.J.C.
Epsom and Metropolitan, but Wallace will be a fine horse
to head the list with in the mile-and-a-half. Newhaven’s
name shines in the Epsom, as well as that of many other
good animals, who are either in the stable or the paddock.
Coil is an absentee.
• * * *
The win of a horse under 14st. at Coreena,
Central Q., has occasioned an argument as to whether it
isn’t downright cruelty to race the breath out of grass-
fed animals under such crushing welter-weights.
• * * *
The good old custom of backing one horse for
both Cups still prevails, and big bets are chronicled
weekly. Though a few have gone very near it no animal
has ever won the double, and the amounts netted by the
ring during the last 16 years over this particular form of
betting would run into vast figures.

Bookmaking in Melb. has actually come down

The cockleshell meeting between the lion and
the mouse summarily cut short the winning career of the
Chelsea pigmy. The favor in which Harding was held
may have been due to English patriotism, but The Bulle-
tin shrewdly suspects that his backers were deceived by
the corpulent aspect of giant Stanbury, and that big Jim
paddled out for the occasion to keep himself warm. The
time to Hammersmith, it is' cabled, was the fastest on
record ; after that the affair was a procession.

The astounding statement that three of the
M.L. representative crew in the Parramatta River inter-
provincial fours contest were drugged is printed by a
Marlborough (M.L.)paper. The three in question belong to
that district. A nice yarn for a beaten crew to go home
-with ! Of course, the accusation is absurd. A “doctored ”
.crew could never have rowed a long, severe race and
.exhibited such finishing dash as did the Maorilanders.
Straight steering and the avoidance of a foul might have
seen Vic. in second place instead of first. This serious
drugging allegation, on top of the row at the time, will
Lkely knock the interprovincial fours on the head. What
have the men themselves to say ?
* * * *
Melb. : “ The refusal of C. B. Fisher’s certifi-
cate is a surprise, not because he particularly deserved to
get through, but because so many other lame ducks have
their loose legs thus legally bandaged. However, this
fine old gentleman can morally afford co be out of the
category of whitewashed boomsters.
' * * * *
The inability of the law to assume anything
that is perfectly obvious was again exemplified last week
when a “ this and the next” merchant was charged at
a Sydney Court with laying “The Captain and Cooee.”
When things looked glum, attorney Crick hotly contended
there was no proof that the names mentioned repre-
sented racehorses, and got his surprised client discharged,
the bench not being sure about the matter. There seem
to be about 111 ways of evading the Gambling Act, any
one of which will serve if advocated by a clever lawyer
who owns spider-legged swift-’uns himself, and doesn’t
know whether they are “ racers ” or not when discussing
them in their legal aspect.

A Melbourne sporting tipster—of the kind
whose predictions are quoted by the tipping fraternity on
the mutual admiration principle—took Dart to be' the
best of Mr. S. Miller’s lot for the G.N. Steeplechase. The
owner’s friends had known, for weeks before the race,
that Larnook and Whernside would represent the stable,
all going well. Dart and Redleap were scratched.
* * * *
According to the unreliable racing historian,
fully 50,000 hats were flung into the air when Persimmon
won the Derby, and the Prince of Wales walked down the
course to lead the hero in. And the grovel waxed more
intense a few' minutes later—“ The cheers w'ere almost
hysterical now, men’s excitement having turned their
heads. A spectacle which has known no parallel on any
racecourse in the world continued. The Prince of Wale's
shook Marsh’s hand a dozen times, and w hen Watts dis-
mounted he shook the jockey’s. Porter, his old trainer,
was similarly dealt with, and so were many hundreds of
others. The cheering had known no break from first to
Last, but when the 'all right’ was called, there was
scarcely a man on the course with a hat on his head.”
Albert Edward, shining in the reflected glory of his ’orse,
was undoubtedly a popular event.
* ‘ * * *
The story goes (The Bulletin prints it in
the public interest, in order that it may be contra-
dicted if untrue) that Brickey Colley, the famous
Australian jockey, w'ho died the other day, really
succumbed to exposure. Returning to the hotel
where he was staying, he was refused admission
to his bedroom on the ground of being drunk, and
was bundled off into the stable, where he died of cold
frozen to death on the n’ :hf of the record frost. Letters
sent to the paper- si: •: »sl ng enquiry into the circum-
stances of the poor jockey’s death did not appear.
* * * *
The V.R.C, judge, an excellent authority on
latest “ form,” fancied Leap Year for the Steeple.
Surcingle : “ GoycTer, now of Katoomba, turned
up at Flemington for this Grand National meet, after an
absence of 15 years—since 1881, when his mighty Sussex won
the big prize. No man was ever more respected on the
Australian turf, though he combined the owner, victualler,
and bookmaker.”
* * * *
The opening exhibitions of the N.S.W. country
football teams in the metropolis left much to be desired.
Bathurst showed the best form, beating Newcastle by 9 to
3. They made a speciality of dribbling rushes, and the
Northerners were quite bewildered by so much feetball.
A dead-heat was registered in the Ar nidale-Orange match,
each scoring 8. Both played remissly, and the kicking
wasn’t even up to junior form.
* * » *
In a football-match at Bendigo (Vic.), one player
was sent to dreamland with a whang under the ear. There
was soon an all-round row, and the police were about to
read the Riot Act when they S’lotted the original delin-
quent and marched him off. When the crowd was swept
hack, players discovered that someone had sneaked the
ball. It was eventually found under the buttoned over-
coat of a juvenile who looked rather stout. .
* * * *
Saturday’s Sydney Rugby sensation was the cut-
down of the premiers in Agri. trophies semi-final. Went-
worths rubbed out an old score, and the gall of defeat
rankled in the Randwick breast when the crowd showed
symptoms of insanity over the result. Warbrick scored
the only try in the first minute ; after that, much energy
wasted. The winners’ eagerness to inflict a bigger drub-
bing caused the award of numerous frees against them.
* * * *
Wallaroo had a holiday game with the ’Varsity,
excelling by 30 to 10. The marsupials swept all before
them with a forceful sweep, and, had the match been
against Randwick, they would still have won. Roberts,
playing with much vim, scored 4 of the 8 tries, and Col-
quhoun, for the losers, played his best game this season.
Geelong’s unexpected defeat of Essendon re-
stores a mild amount of Melh. senior-football interest.
Collingwood and Essendon now tie for first place, with S.
Melb. 12 points behind, and other clubs nowhere. Geelong,
almost last on the list, deserved its win, though neither
team played very good football.
» * * *
English fair play, writes a travelling Australian
to The Bulletin by last mail, is dead and decomposed.
The first successes of the Australian cricketers were
sneered at and discounted at the expense of the opposing
teams. Now a pale-blue funk has set in, accompanied bv
its inseparable companion, blind partialism. At Oxford
especially was the latter most noticeable, dragging the
following comment from a London daily “ All the
Oxford partisans shout as if they had never before seen a
wicket fall, and it may be said at once that never in an
artisan district have I met with so one-sided, unsports-
manlike, and prejudiced a crowd as this assemblage of
ladies and gentlemen. Never a cheer for the best play of
their opponents, loud and repeated plaudits when a score
comes from a snick or miss-hit by an Oxonian. When
Hartley beats and bowls Trott the ladies are particularly
jubilant.”
P. S. Waddy, an Australian, played for the
’Varsity against his countrymen, totalling the third
highest on his side. In the preceding match, against
Surrey, he also batted well, and secured most of the
wickets, contributing materially to the first defeat of the
premier county.
The regulation “ Wives of players shall not ac-
company the team when playing in the provinces,” is
already a dead letter, judging by the appearance of the
various missuses on the Oxford ground. One spouse was
not much inspirited thereby, and may be linked with
M’Kibbin—l for 122—as a comparative failure, up to date.
The prince of Australian captains, W. L. Mur-
doch, is batting in good form for Sussex this season,
scoring over the century against Gloucester. Mrs. W. L.
has a hobby for collecting bats off which big scores h ive
been made. Sir Timothy O’Brien, who had contributed
to the collection, tried hard for a new bit of willow by
telling W. L. he was starting a museum of unused bats,
and he would accept one from him !
Bexhill, where the Australians meet a team of
Earl De La Warr’s, is a new seaside resort, now being
pushed and boomed by that young man for all-and
more—that it is worth, says The Bulletin’s London cor-
respondent. He sold the remainder of his estates to
spend the money in developing this place, which is within
view of Eastbourne. A smart, affable, good-looking chap

Lilley is the first All-England wicket-keeper to
rank as a useful batsman since the days of Alfred Lvttle-
ton. M‘Gregor and a number of predecessors with the
gloves were little or no good in front of the wicket
Among the bowlers Pougher and Hearne can be counted
on for runs, likewise the waning Peel, whereas Richard-
son and Mold, especially the latter, are much inferior to
Australia’s batting “ tail.” England doesn’t seem to pro-
duce Giffens and Trotts, capable of first-class work both
with ball and bat. Certainly Ulyett was a double-bar-
relled gun, but he didn’t keep up his form as Gif. has
done, and his fielding, after he grew fat, was a mere exhi-
bition of laziness.
Kent, which has been one of the luckiest of
English counties against Australian elevens, looks far too
weak to stand a chance of beating them this season.
Surrey seems likely to win one match—out of two —with
the visitors, Sussex may make a tight game of it, and
perhaps Derbyshire, which is strong in bowling.
• * * *
The Australians have plenty of work to do
between July 16th and 29th. They meet in succession All
England, Derbyshire, the M.C.C. and Surrey.
* * * *
The particular luck of the Australians up to
date has been not so much in winning the toss four times
out of five, as in never losing it against a strong team,
save only the M.C.C. By the law of averages —which,
however, doesn’t apply to such a short series--the Austra-
lians ought to have the worst of the luck through the
latter half of their tour.
* * » *
Re the complaint that the Australians make
their matches go slow for the spectators —Yorkshire
scored an innings of 450 against Notts, and Notts replied
with a total of something over 600 for two innings—an
average of 350 runs per day.
**‘ * *
After personal inspection, the English papers
seem to have dropped describing Giffen as “ the grey-
haired Giffen.” Fact is, George has apparently aged
backwards since his last tour ’Ome. Also, English
papers make no reference to the peculiar appearance of
Lightning Jones mentioned in Australian papers.
* * * *
Joe Darling had a good offer to stay in England
and play for Middlesex, according to an Adelaide friend.
Joe runs a good cricketware business in Adelaide, and
preferred not to accept any offers at present. Jones, on
the other hand, has accepted an English offer of £365 a
year and quarters.
* * * •
Says a London weekly : “Centuries have been
scored against every team save Surrey and the Australians.
This clearly indicates where the real trundling talent
lies.”
» * * *
The team of English Players pitted against the
Australians would probably have been beaten by a second
selection. Say Richardson, Lohmann, Abel, Havward,
Gunn, Shrewsbury, Hulme, Peel, Wainwright, Tunhicliffe,
and little Brown. These would have been a pretty fair
match for the visitors, although it is clear that nothing
short of an all-England eleven can reckon on making a for-
midable score against Australian bowling this trip.
* » * *
At the end of the Australian tour it will be
found that Giffen, as of yore, was the one indispensable
man. The “ old man ” still goes on making many runs,
and taking many wickets.

Iredale’s latest scores—94 not out, 22, 114, 9,

In 1862, when Caffyn’s All-England Eleven
visited Australia, a single-wicket- match was played
between Englishman Griffiths (with three men to field for
him) and 11 of the Ovens and Murray district. The
eleven scored only one among them —a no ball ! —and
nine of them were clean bowled. Griffiths then went in
and made 6, being caught by Reid. There were two wides,
the total being 8. Of the 11 who made this mammoth
score of one, only two are now alive, Curtis Reid and
Baldock. The former is squatting in Queensland, and the
latter is the well-known Indian horse-buyer.

Charley Bennett, the N.S.W. cyclist, who left
for England last week, is a marvel in one department of
wheel work. Rut Bennett on top of a hill with any men
in Australia and, pedals barred, he will reach the foot
before them. Neither Zimmerman, Martin, Megson, or
Parsons could come near Bennett in coasting, though to
the outsider it would seem impossible that, riding with the
feet off the pedals, the rider could affect the speed of his
mount in any way. But Bennett proves the reverse and
proves it every time.

The proposal to prohibit the galloway business
within 40 miles of Sydney would receive just as much

N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union is inviting English
authorities to send a riding team out in October next to
give an impetus to Australian amateurism. As a special
inducement they are asked to pav their own expenses A
long journey for silver pots. But the Union, in return,
promises to send a team ’Ome some other time. The pro-
ject is laudable ; unattractive amateurism certainly wants
livening up in Australia, but whether foreign wheelmen
will come to the rescue on the terms proposed is uncer-
tain.

The Yankee team of racing-cyclists, taken across
the Atlantic with the avowed intention of “sweeping
Europe clean,” have hit nasty snags in Paris. The two
stars of the team have gone down before local men, and
the last big meeting ended in a riot owing to the’Murkans
drawing the color-line by “dealing it out” to a nigger
cyclist in the dressing-rooms. The show ended in a riot,
and the crowd tried to set fire to the wooden track.

Who is to succeed Speaker Berry in the
chair? It is well-known that when Wnxon and
Bent were wrestling for the full-bottomed wig,
the choice fell on boomer Bent because he was a
“ good fellow,” and it was expected (among other
things) that he would always keep whisky in his
room. One present aspirant is also strong on the
genial bottle. He keeps a constant stock at Parlia-
ment House, and members pop in at intervals.

between the rails, and my leg was

ever since with swollen veins, and

came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the swell-

An inquiry into the working of Melbourne
Telephone Department is throwing light upon the
joys of a Govt, billet. At the outset numerous
witnesses gave evidence that their immediate boss
confined himself, in a great measure, to the in-
spection of wine and women during business-hours.
1 he books kept in the boss’s office were originated
'A a telegraph-messenger, aged 23, who stated
that he could run the clerical work without any
assistance from his superior officer. The messen-
ger. it seemed, had been introduced to sundry bar-
maids m the office by the boss ; also he had visited
pubs at the early hour of 10.30 a.m. in the boss’s
company, and on one occasion a loose-limbed
Hebe had removed his hat with a high kick.
J Ins, however, happened on a Saturday afternoon.
® messenger couldn’t remember any cases of
high-kicking during business-hours. Two line-
repairers deposed that they frequently saw the
boss unsober or “muddled ” in his office, and one
of them had formed part of a friendly deputation
to remonstrate with the magnate on his giddi-
ness. The boss’s chief conversation with the
men was about women : not about the virtues of
women, but rather the sort of conversation which
the Enquiry Board would be likely to hear if they
went where prostitutes were to be found.”
Altogether, the evidence made it clear that that
boss s billet was a little paradise, where he had
lived the happy, innocent life of a “ model man ”
until the serpent came, in the guise of bad associ-
ates, and taught him to go astray. As far as the
departmental work was concerned, the boss’s
'T-ir behaviour doesn’t appear to have made much
difference. He was as useful after the Fall as
before it, although his duty of doing nothing was
performed m a less perfect manner when he took
to liquor and ladies. The mistake he made was
m coming to the office at all. He should have
stayed at home in receipt of his comfortable
salary, leaving the messenger to see that the office
didn’t run away.

I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Lock Cure Pills completely cured me of a very

I was under the treatment of a doctor tor six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
had a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You

A Wonderful Cure.
Herb Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 1871 I was eight, days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffnes* in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

without success several of the leading doctors

try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few- courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone

THIS COMPANY is being formed for the
purpose of working and developing at a
greater depth the well-known lease of the old
British Banner Company in the Pitfield district,
held from the Crown. The lease consists of 200
acres, and is free from payment of any royalty.
The following is a brief rdsurnd of the past
history of the mine, supplied to Mr. John P.
Roberts, Ballarat, by a thoroughly experienced
and practical man, who worked in the neighbor-
hood for many years :
G. D. Meudell, Esq., 54 Queen-st., Melbourne.
“I worked in the old British Banner, and
in the Stanley, and in nearly all the prin-
cipal mines of the Pittfield District. The
ground north of the British Banner was
extraordinarily rich. The Maiden City and
Boyd’s Freehold paid handsomely; those two
small parties having, I believe, divided over
£20,000 in dividends. Going south, the sinking
became too deep and expensive for small parties,
and the old British Banner was formed to work
the deep ground. This Company sunk their shaft
too far to the east, and away from the gutter, and
bottomed shallow. Then they drove west 500 ft.
and struck the hard basaltic rock in the face of
their drive ; having then sunk a small shaft and
driven further west, they struck the main gutter,
which yielded about to three or four sets of
timber. Being too shallow by about 30ft. to work
the ground profitably, and their capital being ex-
hausted, they were compelled to suspend opera-
tions, and the district became neglected until re-
cently. There are now, however, a number of
Co-operative Companies doing remarkably well on
the same belt of country to the south, and a con-
siderable quantity of gold is being obtained
quietly by them.
“ As regards the present British Banner Com-
pany, this Company bored the ground at consider-
able cost, the last bore was in extremely hard rock
and not bottomed at 120 ft., and the Directors,
being satisfied that it was on deep ground, discon-
tinued boring, and seleoted a site for a shaft about
250 ft. to the north, with a view of avoiding this
very hard rock in the sinking, and of being near
the junction of the Maiden City gutter. This
shaft, which is 9ft. by 3ft. 6in. in the clear, went
through the basalt into the bed-rock at 90ft., and
dipping west, which would indicate that the shaft
is, as expected, near the junction of the two
gutters. As it was then necessary before any
further progress oould be made to erect machinery,
and our party being a small one, we have had to
let matters stand for a time. The area of the
claim is 200 acres of Crown Lands, held under
lease recently granted, and no royalty to pay.
“I have marked on the plan which I enclose,
what is generally believed will be the course of the
gutter, also, approximately, the position of the old
shaft and the new.
“ Yours very truly,
“JOHN P. ROBERTS.”
23rd June, 1896.
Report of Mr. X. M. Smith upon the Property.
Mr. G. D. Meudell, Stock Exchange,
Melbourne.
“Dear Sir, —I visited the lease known as the
British Banner on the 13th inst., and made a care-
ful inspection of the various mines situated near
that property. The British Banner Lease consists
of 200 acres leased from the Crown, consequently
there will be no royalty to pay, as is the case of
most of the mines in the same district.
“ In the early days of the field the ground north
and south of this lease yielded immensely rich
returns, many thousands of ounces of gold being
got on the northern and north-eastern boundary
of the lease, and some £15,000 was paid in
dividends by the Maiden C ty mine, a mine on
the north of the British Banner; while from the
Stanley, on the southern boundary, handsome
returns were also got, and some large nuggets
were found on that company’s ground—one
weighing 1270 z.
“Further south is the New Moon mine. This
mine only recently bottomed on highly-payable
wash, and they are now doing good progressive
work preparatory to blocking out; while further
south are the Pitfield Plateau, Victoria Mint, and
Woody Yalloak mines, besides a number of mines
held by co-operative parties, and at present yield-
ing highly profitable returns to the holders.
“ On the British Banner a shaft was sunk in the
early days, and the bottom reached at a depth of
about 200 ft., and a drive carried on the bottom to
the west a distance of over 600 ft. Here wash was
met with, but, as it was dipping into deeper
ground, a monkey shaft was sunk from the drive,
which bottomed on very rich wash-dirt. From
about three sets lloz. of gold were taken, but,
owing to the heavy expense of working from this
shaft, the Company decided to sink another shaft.
A suitable site was chosen, and the shaft was sunk
and timbered to a depth of about 90 feet., when
the Company’s funds became exhausted and work
was abandoned. This shaft is well-timbered and
divided into three compartments, and would re-
quire to be sunk an additional 130 ft. to strike the
wash. In sinking this shaft some very hard rock
(basaltic) was passed through, but the bottom is
now in nice soft slate country, which I think will
continue down to the wash.
“ In the early days of the field the water was a
source of great trouble, but, owing to the number
Prospectus.
of plants now erected on the south of the pro-
perty, the water-trouble will be easily overcome,
and, owing to the comparatively shallow depth of
the wash, it will not require very expensive ma-
chinery to work the mine, and the shaft could be
sunk and timbered at a cost of about 355. per foot.
_ “ In conclusion, I may state that this property,
situated as it is on one of the best leads of gold
discovered in Victoria, is certain, when properly
opened up, to become an extremely valuable pro-
perty, and I have every confidence in recommend-
ing it as a really good mining-investment.
“I am, Faithfully yours,
(Signed) “T. H. SMITH.”

At Childers (Q.), a few Sundays ago, a
missionary baptised a number of kanakas by im-
mersion in a waterhole. The usual hymns were
sung and the stereotyped exhortations given, but
immediately the boys got on dry land again a.
tribal row occurred, and they set at each other s
throats in earnest. They had become militant
Christians.
Judge Hodges (Vic.) has decided that a
barrister is only a common threepenny mortal like
anybody else, and if he doesn’t appear m cour
to'conduct a case in which he is retained he must
hand back the money paid him. I his puts the
gorgeous horse-hair magnate on the same plain
business-footing as the man who is hired to cait
mud and who isn’t paid unless the mud is carted.
There are four things in particular that need to be
done to put the. legal brotherhood on a sane basis.
1) When a barrister is paid to do certain work,
and fails to do it, he should be liable to return his
fee, like any other man. (2) If he undertakes to
do certain work, and his client is injured by his
failure to do it, he should be liable to be sued tor
damages—like any other man. (3) If he does the
work, and his client or his client’s solicitor doesn t
pay, he should be allowed to sue like any other
person. And (4) when the client pays the barris-
ter’s fee to the solicitor, and the solicitor sticks to
it, as he often does, the barrister should have the
same, power as any other man to get the solicitor
gaoled and struck off the rolls for larceny as a
bailee. These four arrangements would do tue
profession a whole lot of good.

A deputation of Melbourne W.C.T.U.
waited on Minister Peacock the other day with a
new idea rc the frowsy old “ sex-problem,” which
it thinks about all day and dreams about all night.
It wanted a moral convalescent home for girls who
had “made a mistake,” and a law authorising
their detention there until they had grown suffi-
ciently self-reliant to be let out again into the
wicked outer world. Then the W.C.T.U. would
have them all herded together so that it could
come every day and admonish them severely, and
catechise them as to how they “feel,” and preach
to them, and show'them to all its old-woman
friends with much unction, and tell its old-
woman friends their history, and have a real,
good, dirty time without any male relative
around to throw the gloating saints out on their
spectacles as they deserved. It is a truly great
conception. As things are now the W.C.T.U.
harridan has to chase the “ unfortunate ” at her
own home, and can’t talk to her so severely as she
Would like for three hours at a stretch without
some of her relatives interfering, so the proposal
to lock her up for an indefinite period where she
can be talked at with impunity all day is abso-
lutely brilliant. There would doubtless be
a sort of committee-room attached to the
establishment, where the W.C.T.U. and
their friends could sit in comfortable chairs
round the room. Then they would send
for the show “unfortunate” and stand her up in
a humble attitude in the centre of the floor, to be
interrogated and the particular points of her sin
explained to the shocked old lady who hadn’t
heard of it before. Also, there would be a lot of
pleasant excitement in finding out about the girl
“ who had fallen,” and capturing her, so that the
whole street would hear about the case, and bring-
ing her away in the van belonging to the estab-
lishment ; and bringing her back again escorted
by a W.C.T.U. deputation when she was suffi-
ciently reformed, and inspecting her afterwards to
see that she kept reformed. But Minister Peacock
looked at the deputation with a cold expression in
his other eye, and offered no encouragement, and
so far the inspiration has got no “ forrarder.”

Club Humor .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At the Moku Club there was a clique of
practical jokers. Carleton himself was not a man
of that sort by choice. But he loved a joke, even
a practical joke, if it was not too asinine, though
he felt it when he thought that it was he, and he
alone, who was responsible for Moggeridge’s pre-
sentation.
Moggeridge was 60, decidedly over-fed in ap-
pearance, and gone at the knees. He had not the
look of a hero, and he had been known to get on a
table out of the way of an inquisitive rat.
One night, however, on his way home, close on
the hour when one day meets the other, he saw the
color of fire in the lower windows of a two-storeyed
house. He scrambled on to the verandah, aroused
the inmates sleeping on the second floor, and had
them out of danger before the fire-brigade reached
the scene.
A few days afterwards there was a ceremony at
the club. When the place was pretty busy
Carleton came along bearing a handsome Russian-
leather case with silver clasps, and mounted with
an elaborately-engraved silver plate. He disposed
his burden on a table in a manner calculated to
attract attention, and half-a-dozen humorists in
league with him pressed up, as if interested, to
see what was going on. When Carleton had
aroused sufficient interest in his proceedings he
rose to make a speech. After a few apologies
about his own shortcomings, and the honor he felt
it to have been selected to take the lead m an
affair of such moment, he proceeded, to the great
astonishment of the man himself, to refer to Mog-
geridge.
Moggeridge in Moku was a man without an
affinity, as one might say. He was a lone man,
and, being a bachelor, he was still more lone than
other men of his type, who have wives and
families at home who have learned better to
understand them. His loneness had grown up
with him, and though in his younger days he had
often wondered why he did not mix more with
men, the problem had ceased to interest him years
and years before. He was neither unsociable nor
unfriendly, but people thought he was both, and
left him alone. They did not know him—he did
not know himself. They, however, made a mis-
take which he did not make, which he could not
make. They thought he had no heart, whereas
he knew he had a great, soulful something within
him that gave him more trouble than people
thought possible to a personage of his unattractive
and droll exterior.
Moggeridge, in a word, was just the sort of man
that the ordinary fool permits himself to think
Nature has sent into the world for his amusement.
Carleton was not that sort of a fool, though he
wandered so far from his lights as to act like one
on this occasion.
He had undertake the thing, however, and he
laid himself out to do it well. When he began to
touch on Moggeridge the club waited anxiously
as men do who scent a deep and subtle joke.
Carleton did not jump into the middle of things
without paving his way. He was too clever to
allow his joke to escape him. So when he touched
upon Moggeridge he did it very carefully at first,
and with reticence, as though he was anxious not
to offend against good taste. Gradually, however,
he seemed to warm to his r subject, and, increasing
step by step in fervor, he ended by pouring out
upon the astonished hero such a wild rush or
eloquence as drove the club half mad with enthu-
siasm. Before he had done, Moggeridge, who was
not used to hearing his virtues sung, was as red as
a turkey-cock, and was shuffling uneasily m his
boots. For “he who publicly praises you, patron-
ises you. ”
When Carleton had finished a second speaker
arose, and after him another, and yet another.
For over an hour they laid themselves out to apply
■to Moggeridge every'flattering term their mother
tongue could offer. As they proceeded the “hear-
hears ” and “bravos” grew louder and louder, and
the undercurrent of laughter became harder and
harder to suppress.
Moggeridge alone saw only on the surface, and
to him the thing was real. Nevertheless he> did
not enjoy it, and every moment he grew redder
and more uneasy. It was with difficulty he got
on his feet when the silver-mounted case was
handed to him, and when “ For he is a jolly good
fellow ” had been sung he made an effort to speak.
Public speaking was not Moggeridge’s forte,
and he did not pretend that it was. Therefore
nobody was surprised when his first sentence had
half-a-dozen beginnings, and no ending. He was
very, very much agitated, and those nearest to
him began to fear trouble. He was still trying to
collect his senses, when a sudden change over-
spread his face and before anybody could stop him
he fell heavily to the ground. Immediately every
face grew solemn. There were a few who left the
club as soon as they saw trouble ahead, but the
men who were mainly responsible stuck to their
posts. ..ix
Carleton had taken the leading part in the tun,
and he did not shirk the position now. His coat
was soon off, and with shirt-sleeves rolled up he
worked as some men will for their dearest friend.
He bathed the fallen man’s hands and feet m hot
mustard and water for fully two hours before there
was any sign of returning consciousness. Then
Moggeridge rallied for a few moments. The first
thing he did was to thank Carleton for his good-
ness and kindness. He said he did not know he
had so many friends until he heard the kind things
they had all said about him. He was sorry to put
them all to such trouble, but he knew he was
suffering his last attack. He had been taken that
way before, but he felt that was the end.
Carleton was not an emotional man, and he
would have liked to say a few words of hope had
there not been a sensation in his throat that choked
the words back. And before that had gone Mog-
geridge had lost consciousness again.
Carleton and a few others stayed with him until
midnight, when the doctor came and told them at
once that Moggeridge was already past his aid.
A.poplexy, brought on by over-excitement, had
killed him. , , . ,
Half-an-hour after, when Carleton left the club,
he picked up the silver-mounted Russian-leather
case and took it with him. And not a soul asked
what he was going to do with it. Every man
knew that Carleton could be depended on to do
the right thing. . .
What he did in this case was to place the thing
in the fire without opening it, and watch until it
was past identification.

In tlie morning the maid-of-all-work found
a few pieces of bent and twisted metal in the grate.
She did not know what it was, and she put it
away with the ashes as not being worth inquiring
about. Those bits of thin metal were all that re-
mained of a common tan belt which had reposed
in the handsome leather case that had been pre-
sented with such ceremony to Moggeridge the
night before.

Mysterious disappearance seems to be the
inevitable fate of nearly every hangman, the
latest to fade silently away being the official
woman-strangler of Vic. The man s history is a
remarkable one. He is the son of a wealthy Eng-
lish manufacturer, and received an excellent edu-
cation. In ’BO he reached Melb. under engage-
ment to a big wine-and-spirit firm as head traveller
at a salary of £5OO per year, but after a couple of
years of the work he decided to strike out on his
own,” and bought a suburban hotel. This he kept
with fair success until ’B5, when he sold out and
returned to England. There he received a sum of
.£5OOO from his father for the purpose of starting
in business in Melb., but an 18-months jaunt over
Europe and the States was more to the pro-
spective slaughterer’s liking, and when he arrived
in Melb. he had scarcely a penny to bless himself
with. Half-a dozen temporary warders being re-
quired at Pentridge Prison, he put in an applica-
tion and was appointed, and it was while in that
capacity that he became acquainted with Jones,
the hangman, who suicided rather than hang Mrs.
Knorr There seemed to be some magnetic sym-
pathy between the men from the first, for they
r ‘ pal’d up ” immediately, and off duty were seldom
seen apart. The budding hangman soon got
transferred to the police force and was
generally placed on duty at the corner
of Elizabeth and Collins-streets, possibly the
most aristocratic beat in the whole of Vic.
Many a sassiety damsel who was assisted a
cab-block by the handsome constable on the
point ” would probably be disgusted to learn that
the beauteous bobby is the man who holds
the Australian record for woman-choking. In 88
our policeman left the force “ for more lucrative
employment,” say the records; but this employ-
ment, whatever it was, doesn't seem to have
lasted long, for in a few months he is found
taking his first lesson in hangmanship at Ballarat
Gaol, when he acted as Jones’s assistant at
the turning-off of sharebroker Johnson. He then
migrated to Sydney, where he earned an honest
living doing a ‘‘bit of flogging ” at the various
gaols. But the work was laborious; he was
ambitious and had ideas above perspiring behind
a gory lash. So, when Jones cut his throat two
days before the date of Mrs. Knorr s hanging, his
chum deferred weeping over his old friend until he
had penned and posted an application for the
vacant billet. This letter was successful and,
starting by the next train south, he arrived in
Melb. in good time, and the job which even Jones,
the slayer of 20 men and the criminal assaulter of
little girls, had shrunk from committing, was
taken on by his delicately-nurtured and highly-
educated pal. A little romance forms a pretty
sequel to the story. Within a month after the
demise of the esteemed Jones, the new hangman
led to the altar a blushing bride —the widow of his
predecessor.
“Scotty the Wrinkler” Talks by the
Card on Whisky.
Dear Bulletin,— lt is your duty to let th® pu
know what trash is talked about old spirits•
say the old malt peat-reek was better for you than
the modern. So it was—better than imperfectly-
distilled spirit. The least-bad spirit for anyone is
pure alcohol diluted with pure water, and tins is the
white spirit against which such an outcry is made.
I do not wish to be prolix, but pray for a little
space. When patent stills came into us ®
’55 to ’6O, they abstracted the alcohol and separated
the fusel-oil (called feints in Scotland). Tne spirit
was called foreshot, and was about j 5 oP;
Water and six months m a sherry-cask made
whisky, better whisky than any new malt whisky
made "by the old copper and worm stills. Ine
smoky flavor can be given by a drop of creosote
in a barrel. But rum, brandy, and gin are the
same spirit flavored with, say pineapple, es fmce
of brandv and juniper, the two former being
colored with, perhaps, burnt sugar. I write as _ a
born distiller and professional taster. AU the
spirit from our still went to France to be made
into brandy: we found the local trade too slow.
And there is hardly such a thing as malt whisky.
Indian corn is the matrix. A proportion of malt
must be used so as to convert the starch into grape-
sugar. I think one-eighth is sufficient. Vitriol
is used in mashiwt the maize, and yet there
is no vitriol in the spirit. It is neutralised
by chalk or lime. I can get better brandy made
within ten miles of Naranderathan many draught
or case alleged French brew. But fashions change.
Whisky is now the tack, so that the spirit does
not go to France. Five large distilleries have
combined 'including our one) to make saleable and
good brands of Scotch whisky. I won t tell you
the names because y/norant people will not recog-
nise the truth of what I write. As a collateral
proof of my statements, allow me to quote the
Scotsman, April 11th of this year, re the trade of
British India.
Brandv has again given way in favor of whisky, tne lm
ports being respectively 240,010 gallons and 466,464 gallons.
A considerable proportion of the brands is made in Ger
many, and our country does not appear to bave *
poly of the manufacture of whisky, since in 1-894-5 755 b
gallons were imported from Germany. The character of
such importations may be inferred from the fact that it
was pertinaciously argued last year on behalf
tillers in Austria that it was legal, under the Merchandise
Marks Act, to import liquor labelled Glasgow wh sky
made in Austria.”
Cutlery made in Germany, English saddles made
in Germany, Irish linen madem Germany, English
language printed in Germany, British princes mid
princesses manufactured in Germany, but—-new
me miserum ! Ichabod, Ichabod ! Sic transit et id
genus omne , last and most bitter cup to drinK
Glasgow whisky, made in Austria! Ihe im-
provement of grog by age is due to the vola,-
tilisation of the higher essential oils (fusel) and
a chemical change, which neutralises their m-
jurious effects. The taste can be got m three
seconds as shown above. Grog cannot, like wme,
become too old, unless weakness is a fault. But
new, thoroughly distilled spirit is not more in-
jurious than very old vatted, if such a thing
exists, teste the ancients who hang about the still-
head, the cellar, the watch-house and the cooper s
shop of any large distillery. If the Australian
brandy-makers, who started to sell the rmula-
mulla brand, could obtain the same price as Beu-
nessy or Martel, they could afford to produce the
identical poison.—Yours, exhausted by the vast
importance of my theme, Scotty the Wkinkler.

Prince of Wales.
Half-Hanged!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One—two—three rifle-shots in quick suc-
cession broke sharply on the silence of the sultry
night, and then, as every beach loiterer turned in
the direction of the reports, over the still harbor
waters came the hoarse alarm, “ There’s murder
on board the Marion Rennie.”
The dwellers in Levuka, in the early seventies,
were accustomed to this sort of thing. Cakobau,
by the grace of George Austen Woods, Sydney
Charles Burt, and James Stewart Butters, was
king of Fiji and its dependencies. Cotton was
the name of the other king, and “ blackbirding ”
was one of the native industries which flourished
under the joint sway. The harbor was seldom
without two or three labor vessels, and ructions
among the “ recruits ” were of frequent occur-
rence. The Marion Rennie, a topsail schooner of
about 200 tons, was perhaps the unluekiest craft
engaged in that most humane and civilising
traffic. There was scarcely a plank in her deck but
had been baptised in blood ; hardly a trennail in
the planks which might not have stood for a man’s
life.
This time the alarm was fully justified. Tom
Muir, the skipper of a coasting cutter, was the
victim ; Antonio Franks, a yellow-skinned half-
bred Cuban, the ship's cook, was the murderer.
The ship had only returned from her cruise that
morning, and her recruits were still on board.
Muir, coming off to see some of his old mates in
the fo’c’s'le, had appropriated the dusky damsel
promoted to the brevet rank of cook’s mate.
Franks protested ; Muir knocked him down ;
then Franks went to his galley, got a knife, and,
returning, drove it home to Muir’s heart. The
murderer was at once seized by the sailors and
made fast; then, as the boats were away, the
captain had fired three shots from his rifle to bring
off the police.
* * * *
In due course, Franks was tried and sen-
tenced to be hanged. The date of the execution was
fixed, and a warrant issued directing the sheriff to
carry it into effect. The preparations for the event
aroused considerable public interest; for it was
the first time the Government had exercised the
self-delegated right of swinging a man into eter-
nity. The gallo.vs, that typical emblem of ad-
vanced civilisation, was duly erected, but the
greatest difficulty was found in securing a hang-
man. At last a degenerate beach-comber was
discovered willing to earn a fiver easily; and,
having been filled up to the brim with chain-light-
ning the night before, he was “jugged” as a
drunk-and-incapable so that there might be no
doubt of his being on hand in the morning.
When the morning came the criminal’s irons
were struck off, and he, with the gaoler, parson,
hangman, and other officials, awaited the coming
of the sheriff to demand the body. Time passed,
and brought no sheriff. His two deputies, duly in
attendance, stared blankly at each other; and
even the condemned man appeared to resent this
discourteous want of punctuality in attending the
demise at which he was to figure as the corpse.
The hour appointed struck. The next half-hour
passed in suppressed agitation, and at last it was
announced that, in consequence of the unavoid-
able absence of an indispensable character, there
would be no performance that morning; where-
upon the irons were replaced and the wondering
crowd dispersed.
Dire was the dismay in the official halls at
this fiasco. Premier Woods was white with wrath
unspeakable. Chief-Secretary Thurston breathed
threatenings and slaughter against the negligent
official who had thus heaped ridicule upon the
Administration. Attorney-General Burt would
have choked with choler but for the necessity of
bunting U p precedents to afford guidance in the
emergency ; and Chief-J ustice For wood made the
lights burn blue with sulphurous exhalations
from the curses he heaped on the head of that
unlucky sheriff. Moreover, he swore in 17 dif-
ferent languages simultaneously that the criminal
should still hang as high as Hainan, an to t la
intent he issued another warrant directed to the
tw P deputy-sheriffs, commanding them to carry
ou * the execution the following morning,
_ Xt ' vas on F f nks ’> but had to As-
double, however, at once cropped up with the
amateur hangman, who was by this time sober
and sorry for himself, and who not only demanded
lus fiver on the plea that he had been on hand
r f d >' t( J perform ns part of the contract, but
absolutely and emphatically declined to renew the
engagement Prayers, tears, threats, entreaties
P rc l v^ d equally unavailing to alter his resolution,
f nd 1 would have been serious if, at the
last moment, a mate of Muir s had not offered to
discharge the duty out of dear love to his dead
Ap lld ’ and t 0 square on Franks,
u,n S? w e re thus adjusted for the second essay,
and again the gruesome time came round when
lro . n .® were being filed off the prisoner in the
ce ’ while outside the obliging friend black-robed
and mas ked like a familiar of the Holy lnquisi-
tlol>> soa P ed and r ° ve a rope which he then went
and made fast to the gallows-tree.
* * * *
It was a dull, dreary morning, and the
skies were drizzling as though weeping over the
work in hand. The smith was either clumsy or
slow in removing the leg-irons, and the rope was
soaked and swollen before the criminal was ready,
Then he walked firmly on to the scaffold, said a
few words to the crowd, stood carefully on the
trap while the rope and cap were adjusted, and, as
the black domino pulled the lever, fell through,
hanging limp and motionless, a good ten feet,
As soon as it was all over the crowd below scat-
tered, and the deputy-sheriffs, having returned to
the adjacent quarters, were in the very act of
surrounding a good four-fingers of rum, when in
burst the sergeant of police with the horrified ex-
clamation : “My God, gentlemen, that man’s
alive ! ”
“ What ! ”
“ He's alive and singing out-- 1 For God’s sake,
cut me down or shoot me ! ’ What shall I do ? ’’
A quick rush brought the amateur officials back
under the drop. It was a true bill. The swollen
rope had not slipped through the knot. The man
was gasping horribly, and begging in a gurgle to
be released or put out of his misery,
To shoot him according to his wish was out of
the question. The hangman, who, according to
professional precedent, should have humanely
slithered down the rope and danced upon his
shoulders, was absent; so there was nothing for it
but to cut him down. Cut down he accordingly
was ; removed to the cell, fully recovered, and
then left to enjoy his own reflections while the
officials reported the disheartening failure of this
second attempt to give him his quietus as by law
directed.
* * . , * , ™ . ,
If the first failure had caused. an official
commotion, the second created a positive volcanic
eruption of ministerial and judicial ire. Every
one connected with the affair was roundly rated,
bullied, and denounced in good set terms; and the
indignation of the offended magistrates was in-
creased by the difficulty of finding an answer to
that awkward question What was to be done
with Franks? To hang him a third time was im-
possible, Public sympathy was aroused ; and it
would have caused a revolution. He could neither
be legally kept in gaol nor legally discharged, for
in the eye of the law he was dead, though in
proper person most persistently and most incon-
veniently alive. There was no warrant for his
detention, and no authority for his release ; and
official wisdom stood nonplussed at its own impo-
tence to deal with the dilemma.
In this difficulty it did the best thing possible :
it did nothing. Eor three years Eranks enjoyed an
unauthorised existence as a prisoner of the Crown
illegally in custody, and then one dark night he
was quietly shipped off to Maoriland. Strange to
say, during those three years he presented no sign
of the terrible experience he had undergone ; but,
two years after, a man made his way to New
Caledonia whose neck-muscles were contracted so
strangely as to distort the whole of his face and
turn his head over his shoulders. That man was
the half-hanged Antonio Franks.
* * * *
But what kept the sheriff from the execu-
tion as first arranged ? This can best be explained
in his own words, which he —now an Aus-
tralian stipendiary—can confirm. Some short
time after the event he was relieved of his office,
and on meeting Chief-Secretary Tlmrston--now
Sir John Bankes Thurston, Governor of Fiji and
High Commissioner for the South Pacific—he
demanded the reason.
After some little fencing the ministerial mag-
nate replied : “ It should scarcely be necessary for
you to ask. You should be able to understand
that, after your neglect of duty in the Franks case,
the Cabinet cannot continue to repose confidence
in you.”
“What!” was the indignant response; “you
dare tell me this, when you know from the certifi-
cate of her medical attendant, one of your Cabinet
colleagues, my wife was then so near to death’s
door that I would not have quitted her bedside
even to have enjoyed the pleasure of hanging you,
sir ! ”
T. H. PRIOHARD.
Some Chinese gardeners residing near
Laura, a far-north country village, pathetically
appeal to the Brisbane authorities :
Sir, —We, the undersigned Chinamen gardeners living
on the Laura River, beg respectfully to bring the following
grievance under your notice with the hope you will give
us redress.
There is a large Native Camp close to our gardens, and
our potatoes, corn, fruit, vegetables, &c., are constantly
being stolen from us by the blacks in this camp, who
com 3 in such numbers we qannot protect ourselves unless
by firing on them, and this we are not allowed to do.
There is only one Constable at the Laura township, a mile
and a half from us, and he is powerless to assist us.
We request you will order this camp to be broken up
and the occupants compelled to remove to some place
sufficiently distant to prevent them committing further
robberies.
Your most obt. servt,,
Dang Young, Ah Chow, Chang Sing, Lee Seek,
Wong Dang, Chun Bow, Lee Gam Bow,
Yoh Ching.
Thus we have, probably for the first time in pie-
bald Australian history, the wail of the yellow
man against a perpetual close season for niggers.
Questionings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Life, Death and Spirit—with these problems three
I wrestled long, but failed the truth to see,
Then said I: “To the sages will I go,
And with their light they will enlighten me.”
I asked a» aged Rabb,, wise and keen. . .
“ Life is a shadow, staying not, I ween—
The shadow of a bird that flies away,
And bird and shadow nevermore are seen.”
I sought the Christian of unbounded faith. . .
“ Twin mysteries,” he said, “ are Life and Death.
Spirit alone is real, and survives
All shocks of chance it th’ Eternal’s breath.”
Next to the cold-eyed Scientist I sped ;
“ Pray, tell me what are Life and Death,” I said
“ What is man’s spirit ? Whither does it go
When man himself is numbered with the dead? ”
“ What is our Life A flickering candle-flame
Whereof the wick is our material frame ;
Our food the tallow. Whether snuffed out noon,
Or guttering slow, all candles stink the same !
“ And what is Death ? ’Tis terror to the knave,
Hope to the wretched, freedom to the slave—
A sinking on the breast of Mother Earth
Who gives to all a cradle, crust and grave.
“ What is man’s Spirit ? Whither does it fly
When pulse-beats cease and cold films dull the eye ?
Where is the candle’s flame of yester-night ?
Question the ashes ; wait for their reply ! ”
Blind leaders all! If God or brute I be,
I spend my breath for nought in asking ye ;
I go to Death, the grisly Janitor,
Who holds of every mystery the key !

Venice as she is :
On either side of the canal of romance staggers a crow( j
of decayed buildings ; from the roof downwards they are
a mass of squalid ruin, broken balconies cling to the
stained and discolored walls, great scabs of plaster have
fallen from their fronts as if a leprosy had eaten into
them ; for a foot above the water the walls are black with
slime, the broken windows are stuffed with rags or paper,
the shattered steps lead up to doors that swing by one
hinge ; the steps themselves are slippery with a greasy
scum ; to the edge of the lower stair there is a fringe of
foul green weed —it swings slowly in the crawling water ;
the iron grilles, once so beautiful, are eaten by bitter salt
rust; the shutters hang at all angles, flapping and creak-
ing in the wind ; in the crazy balconies there is a lumber
of broken flower-pots with dead flowers in them ; and
through all these reeking alleys the greenish grey water
slowly pulses and oozes, covered with straw, egg-shells,
cabbage-stalks, and nameless refuse. Over all this brood
a hundred filthy and obscene smells, each canal contri-
buting a particularly putrid stench of its own. No
longer does Venice sit in state : hour by hour and stone
by stone she is sinking into her dishonored grave.
