[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Night in mid-Autumn ! Bridge and bay and cliff,
Seethed in the moon’s milk, slumber silently.
A dying tide swoons to the distant sea.
The bland airs breathing round our little skiff
Sigh heavily from the gulfs of Space, as if
Faint with the fragrance of Eternity,
And in a web of silver symmetry
Dark ripples weave their mystic hieroglyph.
How glorious is Dian in her pride !
And near her, with a lustre interblent,
Throned at the zenith see imperial ride
A single star ! She passes : he, grief-spent,
Pa-les for one instant; then, a suicide
Superb, leaps flashing down the firmament.
The Rudiments of Fiction.
"Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder some-
times:
A thing, as the Bellman remarked,
That frequently happens in tropicalclimes,
When a vessel is, so to speak, ‘ snarked
One notes with regret that Ethel Turner is
also adrift on the sea of the girlish imagination.
Her new book, “The Little Larrikin,” (Ward,
Lock & Co.) is, so to speak, “snarked.” Like
“ The Family at Misrule,” “The Little Larrikin ”
is a story for big children which grown-ups should
read with pleasure, but the author has succeeded
less well in uniting the child-interest and the
literature-interest. And whereas formerly the
bowsprit and rudder only occasionally got mixed,
they are now in a tangle pretty nearly all the
time, with disastrous results to plain sailing.
“The Little Larrikin,” to use another Carroll-
ing metaphor, lives in “ Through the Looking-
Glass ” country. Everything about him is more
or less out of drawing, as i'f it had come home
very late last night, and would still be rather glad
of a lamp-post to ket£> it from falling altogether
into topsyturvydom. He is like the Marchion-
ess’s orange-peel and water —“if you make believe
very much it’s quite nice, but if you don’t, you
know, it seems as if it would bear a little more
seasoning.” In which utterance lies the whole
philosophy of the girlish imagination.
Miss Turner, in fact, is working on a radically
wrong method. She invents her characters as weil
As her situations, and her knowledge of life is
doubtfully equal to inventing situations. Her
very fluency undoes her. She observes very little
or not at all, and sits down to erect on a
slender foundation of fact an enormous super-
structure of fancy, which almost inevitably topples
ever at the first gust of criticism as to probabili-
ties and possibilities.
“Lol ” —the little larrikin—has a germ of truth,
doubtless, but Miss Turner’s imagination has
made a Jonah’s gourd of it. At ten years old he
would be amazing : he is only six, and impossible.
But possibilities must get out of the way of Miss
Turner’s imagination. If they don’t, it is “ vera
bad for the coo.” Yet nearly everything has
eharm and interest if you shut ycrnr mind and let
the author blow you whither her fancy list.eth.
“ The Little Larrikin ” would be admirable in a
fairy-tale. But it isn’t a fairy-tale.
And Miss Turner’s characters are getting
colorless and reminiscent: she spends her time in
the clouds weaving fancies instead of down on
earth gathering facts. The literary result is
too often charming nonsense. For example, take
a picture of a figtft between Lol and “ a thick-set
boy of twelve.” (Lol, as before said, is six;
" very little, with sweet eyes ; his hair curled in
fair, little soft rings; his mouth red and babyish.”
" He had been a little larrikin for two years”—
Binee the mature age of four ! has Miss Turner
any idea what'a4-jfear-old child is like?—“and he
was head of a smafl-boy ‘ push ’ he had organised
and recruited lately with several lads of nine and
ten.”)
Lo! breathed wildly on his hands for an instant, then
rushed wildly acress the yard and closed with the enemy.
He fought like.a little tigeu
When two or three minutes had gone and he was still
wneonquered, the thick-set boy experienced a feeling of
astonishment and rained his blows harder.
But he had not the scientific knowledge Lol had gleaned
lr»m Phil and Olera, and even his immeasurably superior
strength could not worst the little iad for several
minutes.
But Linley was flying madly downstairs, and hatless
ever tire tennis-court, through the vegetable garden, and
into the back lane. She burst open Roger’s hack gate
and fell upon the great stout lad, dragging him away by
the collar.
Lol was almost vanquished. His face was scarlet, his
eyes blazing ; in his breast were all the demons of fight
which closg quartets arouse in the born soldier. But his
strength vfes ebbing, his small fists losing their steadi-
ness, and the blood from his poor little nose made a
ghastly spectacle of him.
“ Oh, you great coward, you horrible, disgusting
oeward ! ” cried Linley, shaking the twelve-year-old boy
til his teeth bit his lips and his tongue and the sides of
his month (!). He hung his big head and shuffled and
looked sheepish, &o.
Now, for a shilling or so, Miss Turner could have
lured two newspaper-boys to fight to a finish
before her, and if she had selected one very small
and six, and one very thick-set and twelve, and
excited them both to a “willin’go” such as she
has described, she would see the big boy fall on
top of the little one (whose fists would not reach
his chin), and bear him down to the gutter, where
he would lie on him and choke him till Miss Tur-
ner cried “ Time!” If the encounter were earnest,
there would be no pretence of boxing, and the
“science” of a six-year-old in such a combat would
be ludicrous.
But Miss Turner has heard a little bit about
fighting, and read a little bit, and perhaps seen a
little bit—though no small six-year-old larrikin
ever dreams of “ fighting ” a thick-set twelve-
year-old ; and she has chosen to out her facts to
suit her fancy. It won’t do—not as literature,
anyway. And the example is thoroughly typical
of Miss Turner’s method in “ A Little Larrikin.”
Probably stimulated by Miss Turner’s earlier
successes, a South Australian girl, Miss Ella
Chaffey, has written a children’s story called
“The Youngsters of Murray Home.” She has
not a tithe of Miss Turner’s literary ability, yet
she has written a better and more truthful book
for children than “The Little Larrikin,” simply
because she has trusted to memory instead
of to imagination. Consequently her characters
are real, and her incidents are facts, and look like
facts, and although they are necessarily more
prosaic than Miss Turner’s clever fancies they
leave so ill-taste of improbability behind. Miss
Chaffey, in fact, is a realist in her small way;
and Miss Turner is an idealist without the know-
ledge necessary to make her ideas seem to flower
out of reality. And a detached ideal —an ideal
which is evidently impossible and unattainable—
has no value except in the hands of absolute
genius. Even Heaven and Hall are only interest-
ing because people - think they are going there.
The Hell of the Mars-dwellers isn’t worth specu-
lating about.
It is a curious thing that women save
nearly all their ideality for literature. The
average woman in ordinary life does not appear
concerned with dreams of impossible heroes or
wonderful countries where plum-puddings grow
on gum-trees. She talks, as a rule, of hard,
practical facts—Mrs. Blank’s gown, Mrs. Dash’s
diseases, Mrs. Three-Stars’ servant-girl. After
the boarding-sohool age, that is. Arguing from
life, you might say that her imagination had
dried up : she seems concerned with realism pure
and simple. Arguing from literature, you know if
is merely repressed. And as soon as the average
woman takes pen in hand, out the buried life
gushes ! Eive-sixths of the woman-beginners who
write fiction for The Bulletin never dream of
starting realistically, by describing the people
and things under their eyes, which they know
well, which alone, as a rule, they are competent
to describe. No! they invent some complex
situation, bolster it up with all the forces of their
imagination, dress it in language echoed from
the books they have read, and produce an unreal
monstrosity—because they have not the wit or
the knowledge to make their invention life-like
or probable. The men, less fluent as a rule, are
more realistic. They do not invent; they de-
scribe incidents in their experience, characters
they have met, scenes which have impressed them.
And a much higher average of their “ copy ” is
acceptable-flying low, they are nearer to Truth.
Doubtless imaginative fiction is the higher kind
of fiction —the most impressive and permanent;
but it requires the higher kind of qualities in
the maker. Realistic description is compara-
tively easy. There is wanted a little knack
of observation, and assimilation, and selec-
tion, and description ; but many people can
attain this with practice. Very fair results can
be attained by describing outsides merely—what
people do, how things look. When you go a
little farther, and describe what people think ,
what things are, more talent is required. And
when, advancing, you elevate thoughts and things
to an ideal height, and finally, rising higher still,
draw from individual thoughts and things their
ideal law, and apply the law to the farthest ex-
tent of human conceptions, the path grows too
difficult foyall but fictional genius. But it is
always good to begin at the beginning—with

Items.
It is a commonplace that greatness, even noto-
riety, has a definite cash value in literature. The
men of thought, so-called, are often but the para-
sites of men of action or other men of thought.
Jones makes a name and earns the vulgar
scrutiny ; Bones, as author, or publisher, or book-
seller, or journalist, picks up the biographical,
aneodotal crumbs fallen from the-great man’s
table, and sauces them into an appetising dish for
reader s greed y to know even to the fashion in which
Jones scratches his leg at contemplative moments.
Publicity is the mother of purchasing patronage,
and Jones’s publicity is ready-made: his para-
graph advertisements are inserted gratis in all the
papers; his name metaphorically glares on ten-
foot hoardings throughout the country. So Bones,
as author, saves time and money by hiring John
L. Sullivan to pass for the writer of his book, and
win it instant vogue; or, as publisher, he wheedles
an approving comment from Gladstone, and
launches his literary nonentity at the tail of a
popular political kite; or, as prudent pressman,
he fawns to the local demigod and diaries
down thedemigod’sconversationalinanities against
the day of the demigod’s death. All interesting
examples of the parasitic method, doubtless justi-
fiable on low moral grounds as well as on the
exalted grounds of expediency or necessity.
Parkes, in this literary sense as in others, had a
good many parasites; and The Bulletin itself,
in its time, has whetted the edge of its circu-
lation on the hone of his notoriety. For jour-
nalism does not live by lying prostrate before
Moses and Confucius, or by continually point-
ing out the beauties of Herodotus or Livy.
Livy and Confucius, as popular dishes, have been
off for some time, and the public lack of demand
for them is most enthusiastic—probably because
there is a well-founded impression that they are
dead. The structure of successful journalism is
built on the proverb that a living dog will sell
ten times as many papers as a dead lion. I*
literature the same rule holds, though litera-
ture has its Napoleonio exceptions. But,
generally speaking, there is no advertisement
like Life, though Death booms your sale for
the moment that the living man is held in memory.
Now, Parkes has been dead eight months, and al-
ready is beginning to smell of the Mosaic and
Confuoian era. (Who was Parkes?) And every
month that his biographers dally—is it seven of
them there are ? or ten ? —their gold is turning
into silver, and their silver into copper. They
rely, perhaps, on lists of subscribers; but these in
Australia are apt to be but a flash in the pan : our
population purchases well, but it is so small. And
for the rest?
It is curious (notes the Saturday Review)
how language is apt to fail upon a sudden emer-
gency or at a supreme moment. Jackson comes
up with a black and greasy figure upon an ice-floe
in the Polar regions, whom he takes to be Nansen,
and all he can find to say is, “ I’m awfully glad
to see you,” to which the blood-besmeared and
smoke-begrimed man replies, “So am I to see
you.” After looking steadily into the strange
face, Jackson continues, “Aren’t you Nansen?”
“ Yes, lam Nansen.” “By Jove!” said Jack-
son, “I am awfully glad to see you.” “Thank
you very much,” said Nansen; “very kind of
you.” The two men might have been meeting at
Hyde Park Corner instead of on the pack-ice to
the south-east of Cape Flora—and yet what else
was there to be said ? Heine relates how he
managed to get an interview with Goethe. The
young poet felt that the supreme hour of his life
had arrived, and yet they only talked about the
plums that grew around Heidelberg.
J.J. : “In reply to 4 One who is there.’ With
a fair droving experience, I ean say that I have
met several men who would answer very well to
the description of * The Banjo’s ’ ‘ Clancy ’; and
it is no t uncommon thing round a camp-fire to
hear a voice that you would like to phonograph
for lonely hours. The Australian bushman is
essentially musical in an untrained way, and
strives after melody as does the bushworaan after
general culture. Shy? Yes, the bushman is shy
among city folk ; on his native heath, a New York
bagman is a fool to him for hittitig it off with all-
comers. When you catoh up to a man on a bush
trackyou may makepretty sure that in half-an-hour
you will know all about him, and ten to one it
interests you.”
J. F. Hogan: “Be Sydney Public Library.
I spent several afternoons there in the early part
of last year, and fully half of the books I sought
were not accessible. It was not pretended for a
moment that they were in legitimate use by
others ; they were simply lost, stolen, or strayed.
They were books treating of early Australian his-
tory, books that ought to be guarded and., pre-
served with the utmost care and vigilance, for
they are almost entirely out of print, and in a few
years copies will be possessed by only a very
limited number of private collectors and public
libraries. From what you write, confirmed and
corroborated by my own observation and experi-
ence, I fancy a select committee of inquiry is
about due at the Sydney Public Library.”

LAIS.
How stately doth my Lais go !
With studied step, composedly slow ;
Superb, as some tall mountain fir,
Whom Zephyr’s wing doth.slightly stir :
(For surely beauty is allied
By Nature very near to Pride):
The groves indeed mild breezes move,
But her the gentler gales of Love.
Her cheek with native crimson glows,
But crimson softened by the rose :
’Twas Hebe’s self bestowed the hue,
Yet health has added something, too:
But if an over-tinge there be,
Impute it to her modesty.
Her voice most clear, yet ’tis not strong;
Her periods full, though seldom long ;
With wit, good-natured wit endow’d ;
Fluent her speech, but never loud.*
Her light-spun robes in every part
Are fashioned with the nicest art,
T’ improve her stature, and to grace
The polish’d limbs which they embrace.
How beautiful she looks when drest!
But view her freed from this disguise,
Stript of th’ unnecessary vest —
’Tis Beauty’s self before your eyes.
So exquisitely soft her limbs
That not a bone but pliant seems;
As if th’ embrace of Love —so warm !
Would quite dissolve her beauteous form.
She, too, like Helen, can inspire
Th’ unfeeling heart of age with fire ;
Can teach their lazy blood to move,
And light again the torch of love.
—Halhed and Sheridan, from AmsT^ENETea.
A pine-tree standeth lonely
In the North on an upland baro;
It standeth whitely shrouded
With snow, and sleepeth there:
It dreameth of a palm-tree,
Which far in the Fast alone
In mournful silence standeth
On its ridge of burning stone.

THE GOOD GOD.
One day the good God got out of bed
In a very good humour for us ’tis said;
He put his nose to the window light—
“ Perhaps their planet has perished quite. 1 *
Not yet: in its corner very far
He saw it twinkling, our little star.
If I can think how they get on there,
Said he, the devil may take me, I swear,
The devil may take me, I swear !
Black or white, frozen or broiled,
(He S&id, like a father to children spoiled),
Mortals whom I have made so small,
They pretend that I govern you all;
But, God be praised, you shall also see
That I have ministers under me.
If I dbn’t give the sack to one or two pair,
My children, the devil may take me, I swear,
The devil may take me, I swear !
To make you live in peace divine,
Have I not given you women and wine ?
Yet in my teeth with prayers and boasts
The pigmies call me the Lord of Hosts :
And even dare to invoke my name
When they light the murderous cannon’s dame 1
If I ever commanded column or square,
My children, the devil may take me, I swear,
The devil may take me, I swear!
Who are these dwarfs so richly drest,
On gilded thrones in sumptuous rest?
The head anointed, so proud and pert,
These chiefs of your insect-swarms assert
That I have blest their rights of place,
That they are kings by my special grace.
If it is by me that they reign thus< there,
My children, the devil may take me, I swear,
The devil may take me, I swear !
Then these other dwarfs, all black, of whom
My poor nose hates the incense fume ?
They make of life a dismal fast,
And in my name fierce curses cast
In their sermons Very fine, said he,
Only, by gad, they’re Hebrew to me :
If I believe\anything they declare,
My children, the devil may take me, I swear,
The devihmay take me, I swear!
Children, enough of this : no sect
But the good kind hearts shall be my eleot.
Make love to each other and live in joy,
Without any fear«that God will annoy ;
Laugh down the'great and the Ganting orew——
But suppose the mouehards should hear me S
Adieu !
If into heaven those fellows fare,
My children, the devil may take me, I swear,
The devil may take me, I swear.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, 11. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest veithout
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
"We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly' and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed

origin,and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

dreadful about to h ippen, impure blood, spots or

Dear Sir, Spring Yale.
I have much pleasure in testifying to the real merits of your “ Bioplastine.” After using all other remedies for a
number of years I unhesitatingly give this the preference. My neuralgia has departed and my nerves made strong.
I have induced several persons to give your tonic a trial, with very gratifying results. One lady, a sufferer from
indigestion, felt quite a new creature after taking one bottle of “ Bioplastine.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN PETE COMES HOME.
The drought was bad, and on the farm
The life was rather slow,
So Peter went to work at White s
About a year ago.
Though father ’n’ me have done the work
And kept the place in trim,
The drought-scourge would have beat us, sure,
If’t hadn’t been for him.—
For Jack, who’s up the country now,
Was always one to roam ;
But mother says if tunes get good
She must have Peter home.
It’s in the brickyard run by White
Pete works, and every day
He’s up and out before the sun
To trudge three miles aw r ay.
He started as a “ pug-boy ” first,
(White made the sand-stocks then)
But since they’ve put the engine up
Pete’s worked among the men.
Sometimes he gets all caked with clay
As white as ocean’s foam ;
And then the youngsters shout with glee
All glad when Pete comes home.
We wait for him of evenings now,
For “ not a bit to eat,”
Says mother, when the children cry—
“ Just wait awhile for Pete.”
And when the sun’s last glances set
The west with red aglow,
And Pete comes up the bridle-track
Past where the wattles grow,
There’s not as fine a picture in
The Louvre, or at Rome,
As when the youngsters run to meet
Our Pete when he comes home.
Yes, Pete’s the idol of the house
And worshipped by us all;
He’s just a hero’s picture, too,
So straight and strong and tall.
And mother says when she goes first—
When her work here is o’er,
And God has called her to her rest
Upon the Golden Shore ;
And when Saint Peter says “ Come in,
No longer, loved one, roam ! ”
She’ll rest right there outside the gate
And wait till Pete comes Home.
ULOOLA.
A SONG OF GOLD.
Oh, there’s great exhilaration in the bosoms of
the boys,
Who are sailing for the goldfields in the West;
Though the dear old days are dead, there’s a roar-
ing time ahead,
And the bonny birds are flying from the nest.
Let the old folk bide alone, for the whole wide
world’s your own,
And there’s yellow gold in plenty in the West !
For it’s gold ! bright gold !
And it’s yours to handle, to have, and to hold !
Will you sell your homes, as they have been sold,
For the bright, hard gold ?
Oh, there’s grief and tribulation for the mothers
of the boys,
For the sisters and the sweethearts left behind.
Ah, the good old time is dead ! Ah, the weary
wait instead !
But the ship is scudding on before the wind ;
And it’s well for those who go to the gay new life,
you know,
But it’s cruel hard for those who stay behind 1
But it’s gold ! bright gold !
And it’s yours to handle, to have, and to hold !
Will you sell your hearts, as they have been sold,
For the bright, hard gold ?
Ah, there’s mighty jubilation in the hearts of all
the boys
Who are drinking in the grogshops of the town ;
And the gas flares overhead till the wild carouse is
sped
And the jolly boys have knocked their last sovs.
down,
What with billiards, dice, and gin, you can make
the gold-boys spin,
When you leave the blessed diggings for the
town.
And it’s gold ! bright gold !
And it’s yours to handle, to have, and to hold !
Will you sell your souls as they have been sold,
For the bright, hard gold ?
Oh there’s strange inanimation on the faces of the
boys
Who went gaily to the gold-fields long ago :
Though the parched earth is their bed, very quiet
are the dead,-
Very peaceful are the sleepers lying low.
They are scattered here and there, does it matter
why or where,
When their mothers’ hearts were broken long
ago?
It was gold ! bright gold !
It was theirs to .handle, to have, and to hold !
Did they sell their lives, as they have been sold,
For the bright, hard gold ?

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a J?|?ic© Hitllol*tO TTll“
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Vuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.!!— win at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done
The “ BONANZA”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note-—Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 1896.
The Toy Convention.
The amateur Federal Convention which has
been amusing itself with the manufacture
of a toy constitution at Bathurst got on
very well with its work. Or, to be strictly
accurate, it got on very well until it struck
the two great snags which are always in the
way, and after that its progress was uncer-
tain and precarious. The first of these in-
evitable difficulties is, how to divide the
Federal power among the different provinces
with such mathematical accuracy that no
person or province shall have one half-
fraction more than his or its correct share.
The second is, how to divide the charges of
the Federal Government with such awful
correctness that no province will pay one
half-farthing more per annum than it should
do. When the Federal question runs up
hard against these two difficulties, the apostles
of unity and fraternity generally resolve into
their old provincial elements, and declare
themselves ready to die in the last ditch
before their especial local Pedlington will
sacrifice anything whatever for the beloved
“ Cause,” and as it is practically impossible
to split the very last hair into six exactly
equal parts, the Federal question is always
bringing up with a shock against these pro-
blems, and getting no further. Nominally,
Federation is a matter of unity and combina-
tion, but the debates upon it deal far more
with the question of dividing and sub-
dividing things than with putting them
together. And the question, so far, has
absolutely failed to get any “ forrarder.”
* * * *
It is generally assumed, as a matter of
habit, that the Federal Legislature shall con-
sist of two Houses. Why it should consist
of two Houses more than of one or three or
four has never been very definitely ex-:
plained ; but from sheer inability to get
out of the ancient groove—whether it is
worth while getting out of it or not—the
bi-cameral system seems to be accepted as
inevitable. One proposal is that the two
Houses should both be elected by the people
on a population basis ; another that the
Lower House should be elected on the basis
of population, and the Upper House should
consist of, say, ten representatives from each
province, so that the largest and the smallest
provincesshould possess equal authority. If the
former scheme is adopted, it is evident that
Victoria and New South Wales will carry a
majority of votes in both Houses, and if they
choose to combine on any question where
their interests clash with those of the other
provinces, they can control the Federal Par-
liament. Under the other system, Victoria
and New South Wales, with 2b million
people, will have a decisive majority in the
Assembly ; while in the Council, Westralia,
Tasmania, S.A. and a couple of Queensland
members, representing altogether about
700,000 people, could, if they combined, man
down the representatives of the other
2,800,000 Australians. If the population
basis is adopted all round, the obvious result
is that the representatives of one-eighth part
of the country could boss the other seven-
eighths, supposing it possible to imagine any
question arising on which Victoria and New
South Wales could be unanimous on one side,
and the remaining four states on the other.
If the system of equal State representation
is adopted in one House, then so far as that
House is concerned one-fifth of the people
can boss the other four-fifths. It is the cus-
tom among paper constitution-makers to say
that the Commonwealth is wholly impossible
until those alleged difficulties are sur-
mounted, and as both of them can’t be sur-
mounted the result looks like a deadlock.
* * *
The Bulletin opines that the difficulty is
much more apparent than real, and it doesn’t
matter nearly so much as is commonly sup-
posed which solution is adopted. If both
Houses aie elected on the basis of one mem-
ber to so many electors all the country over,
it is certain that for the present two small
States will carry a majority of votes. When,
in course of years, population becomes more
generally diffused, the discrepancy, if it is
one, will right itself. If one House consists
of an equal number of representatives from
each province, the population of the thinly-
peopled provinces will, for the present, lie
much over-represented so far as that House
is concerned, but when a more general diffu-
sion of population sets in that discrepancy
will also right itself more or less. As there
is all the rest of Time for things to straighten
themselves in, there seems a fair chance that
they will come right in the end. Exactly
the same discrepancies exist under the present
system, so that if Federation is postponed
until it can be arrived at on a mathematically-
accurate principle it only means that while
it is waiting Australia must live for an in-
definite period under an utterly lopsided
provincial principle. In South Australia,
about 100 square miles in the immediate
vicinity of Adelaide can boss, in the local
Parliament, on the population basis, the other
903,000 square miles of the province.
Melbourne, Bendigo, and Ballarat only
amount to a spot altogether, yet when repre-
sentation goes by population alone they can
outvote all the rest of Victoria; and the
people of two eastern counties can do the
same to the balance of New South Wales.
Again, in spite of a vigorous effort to put re-
presentation in New South Wales on a strict
population basis, things are so woefully
mixed that whereas 31,000 electors return
one set of 19 members, 53,000 other electors
also return only 19. In other words,
part of the population has nearly twice
as much political power per man as
another part, despite the best efforts to make
things absolutely fair all round. In Queens-
land things range from 19 members to 18,298
electors up to another 19 members for 28,605
electors. In S.A. the disproportions are
actually worse than in Queensland ; in Vic-
toria only a little better, while in Westralia
they are so unspeakably lopsided that 887
electors return 11 members, and another
8858 electors also have just 11 representa-
tives among them. If this sort of thing is
the best which five Parliaments can do within
their own borders, then the proposal that
the authors of this unspeakable muddle
should fix up the Federal Parliament on a
basis of absolutely fair representation is
mere drivel. And if Australia can crowd
through under the above conditions, then it
can get through equally well under either of
the proposed Federal systems, despite the
fact that neither is an absolutely ideal
arrangement. The proposal to delay Fede-
ration until the Parliament can be built
on an absolutely level system of representa-
tion hasn t much to recommend it, seeing
that it means leaving all power indefinitely
in the hands of six Parliaments which are
constructed on a more unequal principle
than the worst Federal legislature yet sug-
gested.
* * * *
The financial difficulty is the brother and
other near relatives of the representation
problem. It is generally understood that
the Central Government shall take over the
customs, excise, post, telegraph, and railway
revenues, and against this it shall be respon-
sible for the cost of its own maintenance
(Parliamentary and Ministerial salaries and
the like), the interest on the public debt,
naval and military outlay, costs of Federal
courts of justice, and working expenses of
customs, excise, post, telegraph, and railway
services. As regards the surplus which
ought to remain after meeting these out-
goings, the Bathurst delegates, like many
other politicians, haggle dismally, and make
elaborate plans for its distribution on an
ideallj 7 honest system among the provincial
treasuries, and it seems to be generally
agreed that until this absolutely fair basis
can be arrived at Federation ought not to
move. And the basis is hard to arrive at.
With a uniform tariff some of the provinces,
notably W.A. and Queensland, will contri-
bute much more customs and excise duties
per head than others—for the present, at all
events ; and if the surplus is returned on a
population basis a great injustice will be
done. Also, N.S.W. will put into the com-
mon fund a larger net railway revenue than
any other province, so in this respect she will be
badly treated on the population basis. Again,
S.A. will supply the most profitable post
and telegraph department, and Victoria will
hand over the biggest railway system as her
contribution to the assets and the smallest
debt per head of population as her share of
the liabilities, and if the surplus is divided
out according to population both these pro-
vinces will be also greatly injured. Also,
S.A. and Queensland, which have the biggest
interest bill per head, will gain most in the
present by lumping the liabilities of the six
provinces, and Victoria and N.S.W. will
gain least, so again the population basis goes
wrong —in fact it goes wrong everywhere.
Yet the surplus can’t possibly be returned
according to area, for then the province
which gave the least would get back most ;
nor can it be apportioned according to the
amount of revenue contributed, for when
border tariffs and differential railway rates
are abolished, goods for the Riverina will
pay railway freights and Customs duties at
Melbourne, and those for Western Vic. and
N.S.W. will do likewise at Adelaide or Port
Augusta, and the actual contribution of each
province will be impossible to arrive at.

The Bathurst convention, like many other
people and institutions, wrestled desper-
ately with this alleged difficulty, and pro-
pounded elaborate and foolishly impossible
plans for its extinction. Meanwhile, The
Bulletin flatly denies that there is any
financial difficulty, or any more financial diffi-
culty than usual. As matters are at present,
about Half the customs and railway revenue
derived from North Queensland is spent on
the South. The land revenues derived from
the country districts of all the provinces are
largely spent in and around the capitals.
The salaries of public officials are extracted
from the population at large, and also ex-
pended mostly in the capitals. The railway
expenditure in Victoria has been so badly
adjusted that one-third of the province has
far more line than it requires, and another
third hasn’t the semblance of a railroad, yet
all the province has to foot the bill. There
is no attempt anywhere to spend public
money in the localities by which it. is con-
tributed, or to hand back the surplus, where
there is one to the exact people who
supplied it, and if the provinces can’t
make even a semblance of adjusting
their finances on a fair system it is
absurd to demand that the Federation should
do so either. Moreover, even though the
Central Government could adjust things with
such dreadful accuracy that it could give back
to each province every copper of its fair share
of the surplus, it wouldn’t make things one
whit the better. To give the Melbourne
Government the share belonging to Portland
or|Mildura, and let that Government spend
it on railway works in South Gippsland ; or
to let the Sydney authorities annex that
portion of the surplus which belongs to
Broken Hill and expend it on building a new
Parliament House in Sydney ; or to give the
money of North Queensland back to South
Queensland, is quite as unfair as if part of
the Victorian or Tasmanian surplus found its
way to Townsville or the Northern Territory.
Nobody has ever yet discovered a way
whereby this problem can be truly adjusted,
and no one ever will. Federation, no matter
how it is arranged, can’t make the problem
any worse than it is. So far as Federation
is concerned, in fact, there is no problem at
all. The shortest way out of it is not to
hand back the surplus at all, but to let it be
expended by the Central Government in
public works wherever in all Australia they
seem to be most needed and most likely to
prove profitable, with no regard whatever
whether the money is spent where it came
from, or in some other place. The provin-
cial Governments never troubled about this
question ; all they demanded was that the
revenue raised in New South Wales or Vic-
toria or Queensland should also be spent
there. In the same way the business of the
Federal Government is to see that the
revenue raised in Australia shall be wisely
expended there, and it can’t be expected to
cut the details any finer than the provincial
authorities have done.
The Australian Commonwealth—One
Step Nearer.
In Sydney, some weeks ago, the editor, lessee
and printer of Truth newspaper were charged
at the Central Criminal Court with publish-
ing a seditious libel on Queen Victoria.
The Crown law authorities prosecuted. The
lessee and printer were acquitted. In the
case of the editor, the jury disagreed—it is
said that there were nine for acquittal and
three for conviction—and the accused was
discharged under recognizances to come up
for re-trial if called upon. Last week it was
officially announced that he would not be
called upon.
* * * *
The prosecution was stupid : the accused
hinted that it was malicious. Truth is a
Sunday newspaper notorious for plain speak-
ing and strong language, and it is antagonistic
to the existing N.S.W. Ministry and its
members. It has been specially severe on
certain actions by the Crown Law authorities
which may have been merely imprudent,
but which looked prejudiced as well. “ The
Crown law authorities ” is only a form of
words including individuals who have
been attacked by Truth in a very galling
. manner. It is conceivable enough that
the smart of their wounds may have stimu-
lated a desire for vengeance. Officials have
eyes, hands, organs, dimensions, senses,
affections, passions ; are fed with the same
food, hurt with the same weapons, as a pri-
vate individual is. If you prick their vanity,
they bleed ; if you tickle it, they laugh ; if
you poison their reputation, they politically
die ; and if they think you wrong them, they
are as apt as others to use their public oppor'
tunities to wreak a private revenge.
* * * *
The prosecution may not have been malici-
ous : it was certainly stupid. The language in
the article complained of was coarse ; most
of it was absolutely true ; a great deal of it,
if not untrue, was unnecessary. As a mere
woman, Queen Victoria is probably no
better and no worse than the vast majority
of her sex at the present day. She may be,
as Beaconsfield phrased it in a moment of
after-dinner expansion, “ physically and
morally incapable of government ” ; but the
dictum would apply just as well to almost any
other woman placed in her position. Conse
quently, there is little point in assail-
ing her in the fashion of the in-
criminated article, as an individual, and
calling her “a semi-senile old woman of over
seventy,” “ podgy - figured, sulky - faced,”
“flabby, fat, and flatulent,”—and so on, in
language of which the meaning seems to have
been considered less than the alliteration.
* * * *
But this language is not seditious. The
article quotes Shelley’s hymn for Liberty.
Surely that is not seditious. It recounts the
disgraces of Queen Victoria’s immediate
royal ancestors—
Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow'
Through public scorn—mud from a muddy spring—
Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know,
But leech-like to their fainting country cling.
But, if that be sedition, it is sedition which
may be found in every English history—
sedition which is taught in every Australian
State school. The article ably summed up the
results of Queen Victoria’s reign, and finds
the chief of them to be an increase of
£150,000,000 to the British national debt—
the only thing about the Government which
is national, as Cobbett remarked when
satirising “Her Majesty’s” army, “Her
Majesty’s” navy, and “Her Majesty’s”
beloved Commons. But this is not sedition.
The article called the Prince of Wales a “turf-
swindling, card-sharping, wife-debauching,
boozing rowdy.” These are statements
which cannot be proved, and The Bulletin
does not believe they are true ; but they do
not constitute sedition.
* * • *
Wherein, then, did the sedition lie ? Ap-
parently in the foolish imagination of the
Crown Law authorities. This paper glanced
at the article at the time of the issue, and
noted its extravagance, and forgave its
extravagance for the sake of the essential
truths which it contained—truths which can-
not be proclaimed too often; and straight-
way forgot all about it. So, doubtless,
within a week or so, did practically every-
body else. But, by pillorying its authors,
the Crown law authorities rescued it from
oblivion, stimulated the public to closely
read it and reflect on it, and so made its
lesson ineffaceable. Which, if the Crown law
authorities were really unbiassed defenders
of monarchy, was a very stupid thing
to do. The British authorities digested
this inference long ago in the case of
John Wilkes, who indeed hore many re-
semblances to John Norton, Truth’s offend-
ing editor. And six years later, says His-
torian Green, “ the failure of the prosecu-
tion directed against an anonymous journalist
named ‘ Junius ’ for his letter to the King
established the right of the Press to criticise
the conduct, not of Ministers or Parliament
only, but of the sovereign himself.”

In Hyde Park, London, one Sunday three
years ago, the writer listened to an inflamed
orator denouncing royalty to a knot of
incurious dawdlers. “ Queen Victoria,” he
said passionately, “Queen Victoria is a
German .” The first omitted
w'ord was a coarse dissyllable ; the second a
coarse and suggestive monosyllable. A
policeman standing by was moved to mildly
remonstrate. “ Come, come, Harrison,” he
said, “stow that.” “Yes,” said the orator,
with a fierce expletive, “andyou are one of her
bullies ! ” The policeman smiled good-
naturedly and walked away, followed by the
jeers of the crowd. In Australia he would
probably have knocked the man down,
hustled him to the lock-up, and a sentence
of from two to five years’ penal servitude
would have followed. Witness Reseigh
Martin. The fact is, that in Australia, and
particularly in New South Wales, not only is
officialdom less able than in England,
but it is more bigoted and tyran-
nical, and it has an ignorant and
bigoted section of the public to support it.
The English law authorities would never
have dared to arrest a member of the House
of Commons in the circumstances attending
the recent arrest of Crick, member of
N.S.W. Parliament. The English Rey-
nolds's Newspaper publishes in almost
every issue matter more derogatory to
the Crown than that which led to the arrest
of Norton, and is unchecked. English
'speakers and writers frequently and openly
discuss the desirability of a British Republic,


and no official dreams of hampering them,
The Australian democracy permits interfer-
ence with the freedom of speech and of the
Press which would not be endured in monar-
chical Britain
. * * * *
It is not, The Bulletin believes, that
Australians are less independent, but that
they are more indifferent. It requires a
/ii . ~ , u , ,
gieat deal to rouse them to active protest
agamst official encroachments. Of the con-
tempt of native-born Australians for mon-
archy there can be no question. Their atti-
tude towards it is one of cynical sufferance,
apathetic dislike, rarely rising to a spasmodic
intensity of hatred. The Australian’s charac-
teristic irreverence almost atones for his
characteristic apathy. Scorn of dogmatic
authority seems to be his birthright : he
brings all things to the test of reason. Well
may his pastors and would-be spiritual
masters deplore a lack of ereduUt/which
makes their creeds an empty shell. Some
day Britain s hereditary monarch will have
occasion to deplore it too. '
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Evolution of Bankruptcy in
Melbourne.
A debate upon Insolvency Law Amendment in
the Vic. Leg. Council lias disclosed some in-
teresting facts re the system by which an in-
fluential mob of Melbourne traders and specu-
lators shook themselves free from liabilities
without bringing their names before the public.
Mr. Gbimwade, speaking as a commercial
authority, said of the I.L.A. Bill lately passed
through the Assembly : “ The provisions as to
compositions with creditors might very well be
repealed altogether. Until 1891 no one had
availed himself of these provisions, but in that
year one composition was effected, and it was
then that it was decided that these proceedings
should be kept secret. There was nothing
whatever in the Act to justify that course, but
the man who made that composition in 1891
threatened the department that if the particu-
lars were published he would issue a writ for
.£20,000 damages, and the Solicitor-General of
the day gave instructions that particulars
of compositions should not be furnished
to the press. Immediately that became
known a number of insolvent people hastened
to avail themselves of the opportunity, and
in 1892 no fewer than 83 compositions were
effected, the total liabilities amounting to
£5,074,000. That was the year in which men
made compositions of a farthing in the £ for
immense sums, and then went to Europe by
mail-steamer and returned to the colony to
splash mud from their carriage-wheels upon
their unfortunate creditors. Altogether, within
three years, about 200 compositions were
effected to the extent of £8,000,000, and that
was the greatest scandal that ever happened in
the business annals of Melbourne.” Mr. Grim-
wade might have added “or any other city.”
The private compounders didn’t in all cases
enjoy the secrecy which they desired, and which
the Government had endeavored to obtain
for them. The case of B. J. Fink, for instance,
became public almost immediately after he had
paid his small copper coin, and after a period of
uncertainty as to whether the Act did, or did
not, justify any “gagging” of the press, lists
of names of “illegitimate bankruptcies” (to
coin a suitable term) were published in one or
more Melbourne weeklies. By that time, how-
ever, secrecy had served its purpose. The
bloom of scandal had been rubbed off these
private compositions by Time’s effacing fingers
ere they were recorded in print. Smellbourne
air was tainted with a sentiment of toleration for
this new departure in insolvency proceedings,
and commercial self-respect had become almost
a dead letter—thanks mainly to the Solicitor-
General who allowed that one man in 1891
to show an easy way of “going bung”
to his 199 followers. Bulletin readers
do not need to be told that Melbourne
is to-day the paradise of reckless insolvents.
Certificates of release from liabilities are granted
by the Full Court, even though they have been
refused by the Insolvency Judge, under circum-
stances which would not be held to justify a
certificate in any other Australian province.
The existing state of affairs places every
cautious, shame-fearing trader at a monstrous
disadvantage. Men who strive hard to meet
their liabilities are compelled to admit them-
selves fools in a worldly sense, working only
for reward in the world to come, and if they
entertain serious doubts concerning a future
state, their temptation to file a schedule is
strengthened every time they read of a scandal-
ous insolvent slipping quietly through the
Court.
A Matter of Self-Reliance.
The Bank of New South Wales held its half-
yearly meeting last week in Sydney, and the
chairman of the institution took the oppor-
tunity to get a serious remark off his chest.
The said remark wasn’t entirely or wholly new ;
almost every affluent old gentleman who runs a
bank has said it, or something very like it,
before. Still, it was interesting in its way, and
can stand reproduction :
Political unrest here and in other parts of the world,
varying'and occasionally disappointing markets for our
products, all have their effect. But, slow as it may be,
there is no reason to doubt as these causes pass away—as
they surely must do through the good sense, energy, and
rigid economy of our people—so will the revival of trade,
enterprise, and business become more pronounced and
vigorous, and, what is important to the hank, a profitable
outlet he found for our surplus funds and capital. I, per-
sonally, in common with many others, deplore the grow-
ing inclination of the Governments of many of the
colonies to pass measures in the direction of interfering
with the resourceful disposition of the people. Reliance
on ourselves has in the past done much, if not every-
thing, to bring into existence the enterprise which has
made these colonies what they are, and I regret very
much to see that the tendency of legislation is to sup-
press some of the qualities in our national character
which in the past have done so much to make us self-
reliant.
The Bulletin has no doubt that the affluent
old gentlemen who constantly get off this time-
honored wheeze really believe in it; it is pos-
sible to believe in almost anything if one tries
hard enough. Nevertheless there is something
pitiably absurd in the Australian who “ leans
against a post ” rising up to tell himself how
self-reliant he is, and how it is his self-reliance
that has made the country “ what it is.” He
has plenty of good qualities, no doubt, but self-
reliance is just the one he has never shown, up
to date. The Australian has done a wonderful
lot to open up this great country—with bor-
rowed money. There is hardly a road or bridge
or ditch or culvert or public building or half-
mile of railroad which doesn’t represent bor-
rowed money; this great nation can’t even lay
down new wood-blocks on the Parramatta-road,
or repair the Museum roof, or put up Gov.
Phillip’s statue, or patch an old dredge, or
take a few snags out of a river, or shore
up a decayed wharf, or do anything under
the sun, without begging J. Bull to put up
the money to do it with. It imports its rail-
way managers from England, likewise its
bishops, all its principal clergymen, its mili-
tary commanders, college professors, irrigation
experts, and many others. A good half of its
banking business is done for it by its big brother,
Bull. It insures its furniture and other pro-
perties mostly in foreign offices, because it can’t
believe that its own institutions are decently
solid. It only occasionally respects or believes
in one of its own artists, writers, singers, or
actors who hasn’t gone ’Ome and been guaran-
teed by J. Bull as being deserving of respect.
When it finds a new gold-mine it promptly lies
down flat and prays to Bull to supply the
money necessary for working it. Its one
big industry—wool-growing—is largely run
by Bull, who owns probably one - third
or one - half of the show. Of the
coastal shipping business, three - fourths is
directly or indirectly owned abroad, and when
any new departure is suggested the first thing
is to go and ask Bull to put up the money,
and the second is to ask him to build the
ships. The Australian banks, for three years
past, have been in a chronic state of wander-
ing ’Omewards to ask Bull, with all due
grovel, to reduce the interest and give
them more time, and generally to let
them live a little longer. Even when it was
proposed, after much hard incitement by a
Belgian expert, to put up one humble, unpre-
tentious beet-sugar mill at Tenterfield, almost
the first suggestion was that someone should
pack up his bag and bolt for Britain to raise the
necessary capital, and whenever the depression
gets unusually bad the one inspiration is to
borrow the money from Bull to start the sand-
shifting job, or the mud-shovelling contract at
Shea’s Creek. The spectacle of the Australian,
of all men in this world, talking of the “resource-
ful disposition of the people ” and the national
spirit of self-reliance, and complaining about
State Socialism as tending to destroy these
beautiful alleged traits of the public character,
is a ghastly joke. State Socialism may go right
ahead in Australia without worrying over the
possible destruction of this country’s “ resource-
ful spirit.” There never was enough of that
alleged spirit to be worth talking about.
Under Sixteen.
Pastor Rentoul, a blathersome Vic. bigot, has
been attacking the Judges for their administra-
tion of the age-of-consent clause of the Crimes
Act—quoting the opinion of the weekly organ
of the W.C.T. U. in corroboration of himself.
Chief Justice Madden is one of the attacked.
Now, even Chief Justices cannot be always
wrong, and, in the case in question, the
beauteous Madden was luminously right. A
girl, aged almost 16, had been “ keeping
company ” with a boy aged 19—with the
full knowledge of the girl’s parents. They
walked out together at night with the full
knowledge, etc. In evidence, the girl admitted
that she, of her own accord, told her “ betrayer ”
that she was 17. A child was born. Forthwith
the parents of the girl interviewed the boy
(“betrayer” is the word used by Rentoul,
W.C.T.U., and the weekly), and demanded
that he should “marry his victim.” Mrs.
Grundy’s old, old method of compensating for
one child by more children. The parents of the
boy (again, aged 19) entered their veto —and
the boy had perforce to plead his “ age-of-con-
sent ” as a bar to the union. Then the police
were informed, and brought action. The lower
court committed for trial. The jury brought
in a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation
to mercy. Chief Justice Madden endorsed the
recommendation, stated there was no crime, in
the case, and delivered a formal sentence of six
months, to be suspended during the good
behaviour of accused. This plain tale sets
down Mr. Rentoul’s bigoted hysterics as one
more case of clerical twisting of facts to help
out an uncharitable sermon.
An Unobjectionable Surplus.
The Federal revenue problem, which Samuel
Griffith declared to be the practically insuper-
able bar to union, and which the Bathurst Con-
vention and the daily press have been much
troubled about of late, isn’t a very large affair
after all when carefully considered. The situa-
tion pans out somewhat as follows: If the
Central Government, when there is one, takes
over the external Customs (interprovincial Cus-
toms being abolished), excise, postal, telegraph
and railway revenues, its income will be about
£18,700,000 per annum. If it pays interest on
the public debt, working expenses of the rail-
ways, posts and telegraphs, and maintains the
naval and military establishments and the
Federal courts, its outlay will probably be about
£15,000,000. Therefore it will have a surplus
of ,£3,700,000, while the provincial Govern-
ments will go short. By reason of this quite a
number of ponderous schemes have been
devised for ascertaining by a stupendous system
of statistics exactly how much each pro-
vince contributes to the general revenue,
and how much each gets out of it, and thus
apportioning the surplus among them in a way
that will aggravate all parties concerned. The
Bulletin rises to suggest six possible and
feasible and perfectly simple ways out of the
dilemma. No. 1 expedient is to let the Central
Government keep the surplus, and use it for the
construction of public works; there is a vast
amount still to be done in railway building and
harbor construction, and the making of tele-
graphs and main roads, and other things ; and
the idea of actually building railways out of
revenue instead of with borrowed money is bril-
liant and almost wholly novel. Then the Pro-
vincial Governments would simply have to hustle
to make up the deficiency, but by increased
land and income-taxes, absentee-tax, tote-
percentages, State drink or tobacco mono-
poly, tax on race-horses, increased fines upon
drunks, &c., bicycle tax, taxes on crests, coats-
of-arms, carriages, foreign insurance offices,
annexing unclaimed moneys and general
economy, they should get through. A second
device is to saddle the Federal Government
with the cost of the Public Instruction system,
which will reduce the surplus to about
.£1,700,000 and proportionately relieve the
local authorities. A third way out is for the
Central Government to fix uniform excise duties
throughout Australia, but to let them be col-
lected and appropriated by the local treasuries.
This would reduce the annual surplus to about
£1,250,000, which is little enough for railway
construction expenditure throughout a whole
continent. A device which no one seems to
have suggested yet is that (say) half of the sur-
plus should be used for public works, and the
remainder applied in reduction of the Federal
debt. Again the superfluous money might be
got rid of on tolerably fair terms by giving to
each province an endowment in proportion to
the amount raised by direct taxation. In fact,
there is practically no end to the ways in which
that surplus—which hasn’t yet arrived—can be
disposed of. No Australian Government that
this paper knows of has ever had the slightest
difficulty in getting rid of its surplus.
♦
Gone Down Below.
About the most unobtrusive disappearance of
the late N.S.W. session was that of the Lands
for Closer Settlement Bill. It vanished so very
silently that the ignominious backdown of the
Reid Government passed almost unnoticed.
The province badly wants a system whereby
the State shall have power to resume large pro-
perties, especially in the neighborhood of towns,
and more especially in the Eastern Division,
and cut them up into small farms to be sold or
leased on easy terms to agriculturists. The
success of this policy in Maoriland has suffi-
ciently proved that it is not only possible, but
profitable, provided it is under honest and
capable management. The trouble about the
Reid Government’s scheme was that it abso-
lutely reeked with possibilities of corruption
and was wholly inefficient as well. It didn’t
provide that the land-tax valuation or any
other fixed and recognised valuation should
decide the price of the property. It did not
provide for compulsory resumption, which is
the one thing really wanted if the State is to
get the right sort of land for its purpose. The
Government was merely to negotiate for the
property, and get it for 50 or 500 per cent,
above its value, as it does when it resumes land
for railways, wharves, and other public pur-
poses. The Bill, as introduced, gave
the Ministry power to pay for the land
(if it and the seller were both agree-
able), not in cash, but in 4 per cent,
debentures at par, and, as 4 per cent, deben-
tures are worth about £ll2, this meant that a
favored seller who was the uncle of somebody of
importance might get State paper, worth
£4480 in the open market, for land which he
was nominally selling at £4OOO. Further, it
gave the Government power to go behind
Parliamentary agreements, and vary the terms
of purchases sanctioned by Parliament, and to
take over land at no fixed value at all, merely
leaving things to be settled afterwards by ex-
pensive law proceedings or arbitration. The
Bulletin exposed all the ugly possibilities of
the proposed system when the Bill first appeared,
and almost immediately afterwards it dropped
out of sight, and has never since been heard of.
New South Wales badly wants an honest and
efficient Land for Closer Settlement scheme ; but
because it wouldn’t accept one whose sole ap-
parent purpose was to enable the politician’s
uncle to sell out secretly to the Government at
a price which might be twice or twelve times
the value of the property, it has been compelled
so far to go without. It will be interesting to
notice if the lost measure reappears next session,
or if it and the Local Government scheme and
the much-promised State Bank have all gone
permanently into one grave.
Murder Made Easy.
The state of N.S.W. law in regard to death
certification is singularly idiotic. In the first
place, a medical certificate is not compulsory,
though it is commonly got under the mistaken
notion that the law demands it. It is legally
sufficient for the tenant of the house to report
particulars to the Registrar within a month,
and, as a matter of fact, 10 per cent, of N.S.W.
deaths are registered yearly without a medical
certificate. Under the present law, murder
can be most easily committed under the very
nose of the authorities without danger or with
extremely small danger of detection. For
example, a doctor has under Ins care a patient
seriously ill. He sees him on Tuesday
night; on Wednesday morning the “ friends,”
having murdered the man overnight, tell
the doctor his patient is dead. The
doctor, knowing the serious condition of
the night before, gives a certificate without
viewing the body (for the law does not require
the doctor to view it), the undertaker sends the
coffin, the body is duly buried, and once more
the adage “ murder will out ” fails utterly.
Again, a doctor sees a man who is very ill.
That night the patient is removed elsewhere,
and under another name recovers. Meanwhile,
his friends have, as before, got a certificate from
the first attendant; an undertaker buries a
stone-filled coffin on viewing the certificate;
insurance money is claimed and got; and the
dead man and his friends divide the spoil in
another country. And such crimes and frauds
will remain possible and easy so long as medical
certificates are not absolutely necessary, and,
even should certificates be made necessary,
unless and until the law demands the viewing
of the actual corpse by the signing doctor.
Dear Bulletin, —The question of law reform
is surrounded by difficulties which your recent
contributor ignores. Law, undoubtedly, should
be general, equal, and certain. The legal rule
is, generally speaking, plain enough ; the un-
certainty arises when you attempt to apply the
rule to a certain set of facts. The process of
muling the facts, which are most frequently
disputed, and applying the rule to them is one
ot a purely scientific character. The ever-
increasing complexity of modern life renders it
impossible for any Act of Parliament to do
anything but lay down a general principle,
winch must be applied to each case as it arises
Ihe law may say “ Do not steal ” ; but it then
has to be settled what kinds of taking are
theft. At first sight it seems easy enough to
say what acts fall within this prohibition and
what not; but cases arise which it is difficult to
place on one side or other of the line dividing
the two classes. No matter how carefully de
tails are laid down by statute this will in some
measure remain true. The question of inter-
pretation arising in any case may be reduced to
this form : Granted the law is that the con-
ditions A give rise to the legal consequences X.
does the specific set of facts m fall within the
genus A . It is the difficulties inherent in such
an investigation which give rise to the crv of
the uncertainty of the law.—R.R. J
The cables say (and it is probably true, never-
theless) that—“ The United States ironclad
lexas, 6300 tons displacement, has sunk in
Brooklyn naval dockyard, settling down in the
niud at the bottom.” The alleged reason is
a broken valve below water-line. A warship is
about as reliable as G. H. Reid’s finance. Two
years ago the U.S. ironclad Atlantis tried its
ram on a decayed derelict that was spoiling the
appearance of the ocean. The derelict was
scientifically rammed, but continued to float,
while the Atlantis crawled in a precarious con-
dition back to port. If the weather had not
been good, the mysterious disappearance of a
warship would have been recorded. When the
British ironclad Camperdown did its celebrated
feat of ramming the flagship Victoria, the Vic-
toria turned turtle and went to the bottom of
the Mediterranean—but the Camperdown only
escaped the same experience by a stroke of
luck. Even naval experts know what brittle
theories warships are. That is why the Aus-
tralian squadron never gets into Bass Straits
except during the fine weather at Melb. Cup
time. Let a warship out in the dark or in the
wind—and there is immediate danger that it
will run into itself or fall overboard. That is
why the Victorian miracle of defence, the
Nelson, is always connected by telephone with
the mainland.
Cornelius Job Ham, of the Vic. Leg. Council,
is much shocked by a clause in the Insolvency
Law Amendment Act which provides that the
court shall not release an estate “ unless the
offer of composition appears reasonable and cal-
culated to benefit the general body of creditors.”
Ham can’t understand why the creditors should
not be left to accept or reject the composition
as they may think fit. The innocence of Ham
is pathetic, all things considered. He has lived
all these years and been photographed in civic
robes—he looks a veritable archangel in those
robes—and yet he has never heard of bogus
creditors forming a three-fourths “majority”
to overrule the objections of the genuine
“ minority ” that can’t help itself. If every in-
solvent’s schedule were a truthful statement of
debts and assets the composition offered would
always be reasonable, and the court would in-
variably release the estate. The new clause is
intended to protect bona-fide creditors from
being compelled (as they are compelled under
the present law) to accept the majority vote of
other creditors whose claims will be regarded
with reasonable suspicion by his Honor. There
is much talk about “deserving insolvents” in
Vic. Leg. Council. Among traders there are
very few deserving insolvents who can’t pay 7s.

N.S. Wales Assembly is carrying government
by caucus to the extent of not even pretending
to turn up to roll-call (by the way, why don’t,
they have roll-call ?). Everything having been
“ cut-and-dried ” beforehand, the inference
taken seems to be that there really is no neces-
sity why anyone should be “ in the House” on
any bill, or motion, except the bare mover and
seconder and the well-paid Speaker. Small
wonder that there was a rush after the billet
of Parliamentary caterer ! But isn’t all this
too expensive and time-wasting? Why not
this way: Let the “ proceedings ” be printed
beforehand, the House open formally with
prayer, and Jollyanfat (prayer without fast-
ing for him) rise grandiosely and say—“ Mist-
speaker begmove Proceedings be taken as
printed.” Lyne {if present) : “ Mistspeak beg-
second.” Speaker: “ Quesch’n is thathese
Proceedingstaken asprinted. Alltbat pinion
say Aye; cont No ; I savit.” Jollyanfat :
“Begmove House d’now ’journ.” Lyne :
“Begseck.” Speaker: “ Ques is Housenow-
journ those that pinion say A cont No I savit.
House nowjourned.” This would be ever so
much cheaper, ever so much more effective, and
ever so much jollyanfatter all round. And
ever so much more dignified than the present
“ tomfoolery on wages.”
That cumbrously-named N.S.W. institution,
“ The Deaf and Dumb and Blind,” situated at
Newtown-road, Sydney, held its annual meet-
ing the other day under the presidency of Gov.
Hampden, and passed a vote of thanks to the
N.S.W. Government and Parliament for a sub-
sidy of ,£450 received during the year. Then
Rev. S. W. Wilkinson moved that the compiittee
for the ensuing year consist of the Rev. Dr.
Sellors, Rev. Luke Parr, Rev. W. Dunstan,
Rev. Joseph Oram, and Rev. Si Wilkinson.
This motion was seconded by Rev. Dr. Sellors
and carried. The foundation-stone of the Deaf
and Dumb and Blind Institution was laid a
quarter of a century ago by Gov. Belmore,
and then and for 20 years after it boasted free-
dom from sectarianism in fact and in color.
What is the atmosphere with which a commit-
tee, constituted as above, can be supposed to
surround any State-subsidised establishment ?
S.M. Herald, which, before the U.S.
Presidential election, had been hedging on “Bryan

The “Ironmaster,” which forms this
week’s bill at Sydney Lyceum, is a distinctly
powerful and effective drama, though its motive
is not especially new, and the same idea has been
worked up often, both before and afterwards,
generally by much worse craftsmen than Ohnet.
There is some faint semblance of the problem play
about it: its moral is that the good, high souled
woman who has made, for some cause or another,
a loveless marriage with a mere casual acquaint-
ance, has the same horror of being pawed by her
husband and of being left alone with him at
night in a strange house as if he were any
other stranger. The fact that a certain law-
ful formula had been mumbled over them
doesn’t ease the situation in the least. The
central fact of the “ Ironmaster ” is that not even
16cwt. of marriage service can make it one whit
less horrible for a woman of fine feelings to be
pawed under the aforesaid circumstances, and the
restof thedramanaturally evolvesout of this. There
are quite a lot of fine situations in it, and an un-
fathomable amount of soul. It is a play wherein
the anguished heroine persistently beats her chest,
like the gorilla dolefully smacking himself in the
great African jungle ; but it presents the pro-
blem in a perfectly clean aspect, and is bright
and eloquent and garnished with four appropriate
intervals for drinks. Mrs. Potter has now got
her mannerisms down to zero—her zero, that is.
She still expresses emotion by throwing her head
back with her eyes closed and her hand clutching
her breast, and petrifies in that attitude; also she
turns up her eyes in the old painful manner and
has the same old difficulties with her hair. But
she condenses herself more, and doesn’t sit and
think on so much furniture, and her strange accent
is more under control, and she has ceased to paint
her forehead, and on the whole her Claire de
Beaulieu is a really good performance in almost
every point.
• * • *
Bellew’s hero goes one better ; it is a very
fine performance in every point. It is difficult to
suggest any matter in which the manly ironmaster
could be much improved, unless the hat which he
wears at the duel was made a less glaring misfit.
The rest of the co. may be set down as satisfac-
tory. Miss Linda Raymond, who has steadily
improved of late, adorns the wicked Duchess with
a glassy smile and a dazzling set of teeth and a
cast-iron laugh and a general aspect of depraved
flitter which are very realistic, and Montgomery’s
>uke is noteworthy, partly for its own sake, partly
for the actor’s growing resemblance to Frank
Cates, deceased. Other people, including Oily
Deering, arouse no special execration, and Orlando
Daly is specially commendable, inasmuch as it
appears from the bill that he plays two separate
characters who come in together; and it is only-
one man in a hundred who can enter along with
himself in a state of absolute calm. This journal
here smothers its emotion by remarking that the
“ Merchant of Venice ” is billed for Saturday.
* # * *
The trouble between the rival Sydney man-
agements, after raging furiously for some days,
arrived at a peaceful settlement. It was an in-
teresting disturbance while it lasted. The old
management flatly refused to quit, and wouldn’t
let the new management’s people in to paint the
scenery for their forthcoming production. When
they did get in they were promptly hustled out.
Finally, acting on legal advice, they lay down flat
on the floor, and refused to stir. There being
three policemen present it was impossible to shift
them with hot water or similar severe measures,
so they were carried out and deposited on the
pavement. The old management issued writs
against the new one claiming large damages for
slander, libel, assault, illegal entry, disturbance,
midnight marauding, moral incendiarism and pro-
spective breach of the peace, or something to that
effect. Also, it took to sleeping on the premises
as a guarantee of possession, and it is vaguely
alleged that someone representing the new
management came round and whistled at it disre-
spectfully through the keyhole. Both manage-
ments went round and warned the paiiers against
inserting the other fellow’s advt. Next, the new
management applied to the Courts for an injunc-
tion, or a carnation, or a pelargonium, or some-
thing, and got a temporary one, good for 24 hours.
And then, just as the public had made up its mind
that the trouble would end in both plays being
performed simultaneously on the same stage, with
the giddy, frivolous Chinatowners falling over the
serious dead body in “ Face to Face,” and the
deserted wife moaning with her infant up against
the lady whose fancy dress stopped at her knees,
and that the two proprietors would denounce each
other from the footlights like the two-headed
infant in a state of disagreement, it was announced
that a settlement had been arrived at. All the
cases were withdrawn, and everybody parted in a
dreadful state of mutual esteem, and it wasn’t even
explained whether the two firms had played
Yankee-grab for the theatre, or had fought 18
rounds in the paint-room up against the wet
scenery.
* * * *
The first night of the Firm’s management
at Her Majesty’s was a big affair. H.M.’s, with
its bright coloring, its spacious vestibule, and its
vast dimensions, ought undoubtedly to be the
fashionable theatre of Sydney—no other one can
compare with it as a first-class show-house; and
the instant W. and M. took possession it started to
blossom like the big sunflower or the bread-fruit
tree. All the daughters of Judah were there in
barbaric magnificence, and all their fathers rolled
up, and created a general impression that der
synagogue was oudt. The audience, which was an
immense one, mostly came in late with its jewellery
clattering like crockery before a gale, and it talked
loud all through the first act, both of which are
reliable signs of fashion; the audience in the Rignold
and Woods and Cosgrove days kept silence, and
never banged its bedizened bosom deafeningly
with its fan. The “ Trip to Chinatown ” went
much better than at its original first night. It was
45 minutes shorter, so that it didn’t leave the same
feeling of deadly weariness behind it, and an airy,
frivolous play can look bright when it ends at 11,
whereas the same play ending at 11.45 makes the
listener feel like Job wearily scraping himself with
a potsherd on that ancient ash-heap in Uz. The
principal change in the cast is the substitution of
Julian Mitchell for the departed Patrice as Willie
Crow. Patrice didn’t look at all like a male per-
son, so the new man, who looks painfully male, is
much more convincing. Also, though The Bul-
letin prefers his performance to the other, he
looks so old and tired and leaden-eyed that his
name doesn’t fit ; no one could suppose for a
moment that he hadn’t left off growing 10 years
ago at least. Harry Conor is as humorous as
aforetime, and Frank Lawton’s wonderfully
melodious whistle is all it used to be. Sadie
M‘Donald, whom some veracious chronicler repre-
sented as crippled for life through dislocation of
the back in a high kick, seems perfectly fresh and
in good condition. Which same remark applies to
Bessie Clayton, the dancing contortionist, and the
bright-eyed widow, Geraldine M‘Garin. And
“Chinatown” in general is the same airy frivol
about nothing that it was aforetime, and the
frothy head on it is just as unstable as of old. The
“Milk White Flag” follows on Saturday for one
week, the last of the present co.

George Rignold re-opens Sydney Royal on
Saturday with a stupendous blast of “ Henry V.”
The Bulletin, having just founded its great
Society for Being Rather Tired of Shakespeare,
has grave doubts whether “ Hen. V.” is quite the
thing Sydney wants most at present, but Melb.
reports of this latest revival leave no doubt that it
is a great pageant, full of historical accuracy and
ancient frill, well-played, well-mounted, and
showing G. Rignold at his best. And G.R. at his
best is something very considerable.

Another Cinematographe the ‘ ‘ only
authentic ” one, run by Sestier and Barnett—was
announced to put in an appearance at Sydney
Criterion on Tuesday night, and as the advt. says
it includes a complete panorama of the Melb. Cup
and a special picture of Newhaven it ought to
boom beyond all precedent. How it does boom
will be fully expounded next week. Meanwhile,
it is something beautifully appropriate that the
first Australian picture presented by the new
machine should be a horse-race. Of course it had
to be either that or a football-match.

The well-known and beloved G. L. Good-
man quits the “Firm” shortly to boss Adams’s
Palace of Varieties, and the Firm proposes to
express its regret at the severance by inflicting a
testimonial-benefit on its old guide and mentor,
said atmospheric disturbance to take place at the
Lyceum on the afternoon of next Thursday (Dec.
3). As the immensely rich relative who died, or
was murdered, or otherwise pegged out in London
some time ago, and left a portion of his stupendous
pile to Goodman, has now proved only worth £5
or so, and Goodman’s share doesn’t nearly cover
his proportion of the law and burial and tombstone
expenses, Sydney can roll up to his testimonial
with a light heart. There seems something incon-
gruous about helping to testimonialise a friend
who has just come in for a half-billion or so, but
in the case of a friend who didn’t come in for any-
thing, and had to subscribe towards the tombstone
as well, the position is different. The Firm’s
manager is so universally popular that his farewell
show should be held at Her Majesty’s, the only
theatre large enough to accommodate all the people
who ought to be there.
* * *
‘ ‘ Stars of All Nations, ” at Melb. Princess’s,
is a novel show, insofar that it represents about
two-thirds of an ordinary-sized variety-entertain-
ment doing duty for a full programme in a theatre
where much is expected, and prices rank accord-
ingly. High-toned accessories and surroundings
cannot disguise the fact that twelve music-hall
artists served up in eight courses, with orchestral
overture and operatic selections, form a thin menu
in comparison with former generous spreads pro-
vided at the glittering Princess’s. “Stars of All
Nations,” there is reason to fear, will not beam
upon surging audiences for four consecutive weeks
unless either the tariff be reduced or the company
of stars enlarged.

Henry Lee, who comes to us with a high
reputation as a comedian, impersonates Great
Men past and present, from Shakespeare to Glad-
stone, and is so confident of his ground that he
actually has the nerve to recite or talk in each
character. R. G. Knowles, “ the very peculiar
comedian,” is a genuine success, despite an unin-
cisive voice, and manages to patter off a series
of gags more or less old, with an air
of freshness and spontaneous-seeming humor.
Clotilde Antonio, a trim-built little contortionist,
apparently in her teens, will be considered a
fetching feature of the show. This small sister to
Adelina Antonio does all that is accomplished by
the muscular Eclairs (of Fitzgerald Bros.’co.), and
more besides. Her most surprising feat is the
only ungraceful item on her list. Balanced upon
her head, with her legs extended “ split ”-
wise, she scrapes a popular melody from a
violin. It is a gruesome caricature of the popular
tune, but even a musical critic couldn’t slate the
fiddling of a damsel so strangely situated. The
Delevines, three Satanic gambollers of the Girard
class, are a good turn, also four other turns are
neat and pleasing. Arthur Garner has drawn
upon ’Murka for the bulk of the company, and
been careful not to engage any rubbish. Perhaps
this entertainment errs on the side of respect-
ability. The happiest music-hall turn is not
always the most virtuous, for the heart of man is
desperately wicked at all times, and his best girl
likes to blush once in a way.

The variety show at the Opera House is as
meaty as usual. On Saturday night Rickards
arrived again, looking ten years younger than his
average age, and his disciples found him fully up
to previous sample. The house, which rose at
Arry before he started to sing, was loth to let him
go. In fact, the only person glad to let Rickards
go was his own perennial self, who went vigorously
all the time.
** * *
Bland Holt’s gigantic bare-legged drama,
known—for want of a more suitable title—as
“ One of the Best,” was set up at Melb. Royal on
Saturday night. A conflagration of city ware-
houses broke out in opposition to this gaudy
spectacle, but an enormous attendance at the fire
made no appreciable difference to the gathering
inside the good old shop, from which fact one may
assume that the new season’s goods have come to
fill a public want. “One of the Best,” as The
Bulletin remarked six months ago, is a military
melodrama in which grim-visaged war gets no
show whatever. It doesn’t deal with a departure
of troops for the Soudan, followed by fearful
slaughter of dancing dervishes and waving of the
Union Jack, after the last round of car-
tridges has been served out to a beleagured
garrison. Some peaceful treachery by Cosgrove
at Walter Baker’s expense forms the plot. Baker
has been suffering from Cosgrove’s treachery ever
since they began to act together, also a misguided
damsel in distress has had reason to curse the day
when Cosgrove aforesaid first folded her to his
black heart, and still they allow the remorseless
person to go on stealing papers under easy cir-
cumstances, as though nothing were previously
known against his character. In this instance
Cosgrove steals British army secrets from a
safe in the major-general’s office, aud the
crime being inevitably fixed upon Baker
the army assembles in great force—probably the
greatest force ever known at the Royal—to see
Baker drummed out of the service. Then the
misguided girl, driven mad as usual by Cosgrove’s
bitter sneer, gives him away to the majah-general,
consequently Baker is drummed back into the
army for all he is worth, and the curtain falls upon
a picture of that experienced hero thanking
Heaven that he has kept his philabeg unspotted
before the world.
* * * *
Outside the lavish display of Highland
regiment and mounted infantry (or officers on
horseback) “ One of the Best ” is not a particu-
larly exciting drama. It contains too much dia-
logue and not enough incident. About half of
the dialogue is divided between Bland and Mrs.
Holt, who supply the story with a comic relief
which never varies in tone or purpose. Mrs. Holt
doesn’t recognise Bland when he appear in a kilt,
and Bland doesn’t recognise her when she
appears in “rationals.” In the first act
they talk freely of getting married, and
in the last act they are still talking on
the same subject, and, during the meantime,
they have talked of very little else. Nevertheless,
the consummate cheerfulness of these skilled comic
relief-givers enables them to get through with
honors. Miss Watson, Miss Franees Ross, Charles
Brown, Harford, and other people, including
Albert Norman (whose speaking voice is a lighter
and more wobblesome tenor than ever), and not
forgetting Corlesse, participate in Bland Holt’s
latest. The Bulletin was about to say latest
triumph, but it will wait for further evidence on
this point.

“ A Mother of Three ” is now concluding
a giddy career of four weeks at Melb. Bijou. On
Saturday the Brough management will produce
“ Mrs. Ponderbury’s Past,” of which this journal,
in common with all other journals, is requested to
mention that the Past doesn’t contain a serious
problem, or lead up to a psychological study. It
is a farcical Past, and Mrs. Ponderbury herself is
a frivolous item in three acts.

At a matinee benefit to the Frantz Family
last week, a fine manly figure of a military per-
sonage appeared upon Melb. Opera House stage
and spoke a few words, in a deep, resonant voice,
to the effect that he was handing to the Family
some souvenirs of the admiration which their
athletic entertainment had aroused in amateur
athletic circles. Then the warrior hastily disposed
of the souvenirs, and retired in not-undignified
confusion. Such incidents as this always remind
one that cheek is the first requisite for a public
performer. The amateur spouter had an imposing
stage appearance, a voice big enough to fill two
theatres, and a hearty manner of speaking his
words—but being troubled by the idea that he
was making a fool of himself, he felt truly happy
to escape from public view. What a contrast to
the ordinary actor who, sans appearance, voice, or
“ heart ” to recommend him, can strike an attitude
in the centre of the stage and proclaim himself the
gallant hero he thinks he is every time he gets a
chance!

One of the best-played minor parts in Rignold’s
Henry V. was a corpse in the battle-scene. He was an
intelligent corpse with a fine eye for grouping. He lav
with his arm covering his face, and, to impart a touch of
realism, a soldier rolled him over. He had to move his
arm to allow the roll to proceed, but, once stationary
again, he covered his face with it once more, and lav
calm in the peace of picturesque death.

Dear B.— I wanted a play typed last week, and a city
agency undertook to provide me with a “ typiste.” But
the young lady selected, a discreet ingenue of about 22,
flatly refused the job when informed of the nature of the
typing she was required to do. “Oh ! I couldn't possibly
type a play,” she exclaimed. Notwithstanding a good
pay-prospect and the threat that her name would be taken
off the agency’s books if she declined, she resolutely stuck
to it that her parents wouldn't allow her to type " thea-
trical stuff,” and departed with a fine air of outraged
decency. This statement may look dizzy, hut it’s frozen
fact.—B.E.
The putrescent Purity Party (writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent) were annihilated before the annual
entertainments tribunal, and the giddy • musie’alls
marched forth virtuously victorious. Dry, quartz-faced
gins wearing eye-windows to intensify tlie glassiness of
their stony stare, a id limp, black, rusty robes that rustled
against their sapless .frames, testified with cicada-shrill-
ness to the voluptuous abandon and abandoned volup-
tuousness of the devilishly-delirious “halls.” One fruit-
less searcher after the fascinating secret of polygamic
passion told the Licensing Committee in a reptilian
whisper that in the Oxford Promenade she had heard a
depraved woman say “ WELL ! ” to a debauched man.
The defending manager suggested that it was merely a

A. G. Knowles’ well-known “ or what ” gag came in for
branding, but the duff-headed, French-bean-bodied par-
son’s wife lost the point among her own pronounced
physical peaks, and the condemnatory count fell
fiat. And the gag is this :- “ Basely ungrateful, she
turned on me one day and asked, ‘Do you mean mar-
riage, or what?’ ‘And —I—said— ‘or what.’ So she
left me, and I’ve been an ‘or whater’ ever since.” It
speaks well for the London halls when this is the most
formidable indictment that can be brought against them
in a twelve months, and, in fact, the clever “ turns,” giant
“ chuckers-out, ’ and business-like mercenariness of the
international vestals combine to rob adorned seductive-
ness of its charm, and make the halls dully respectable to
all but touring cricketers and village chawbacons.

pleasant, lively people—large farming district—good
crops—prosperous times—all think you would do very
well —splendid hall, fine seating accommodation, cen-
trally situated, good dressing-rooms, good stage-splen-
did stands. At this point ordered beer for the company.
In fact everything that is calculated to give us a thor-
oughly good season, but that another company has
engaged the hall for a long period. Shall I continue on?”
Then Daniel Barry calculated the cost of the wire and
lifted up his voice in prayer.

The Bank of New South Wales states that the
net profit for the half-year ended 30th September is
£87,660, a slight improvement on the £86,460 and
£84,737 of the two previous periods. A 9 per cent,
dividend absorbs £87,458, and £202 added to previous
balance makes £22,331 carried forward. The paid-up
capital is now £1,946,940. The reserve has been increased
by £6673 premiums on new shares, and stands at
£1,190,250, so the total shareholders’ funds are over
£3,100,000. The business keeps steadily expanding 1 , and
the coin reserve alone now stands at the enormous figure
of £6,635,337. Taking coin, Government debentures, &c.,
together, the B.N.S.W. has £7,920,000 of liquid assets,
equal to more than 40 per cent, of its entire liabilities to
the public. These immense reserves don’t help much in
the making of big profits, but they render the Bank of
N.S.W. distinctly the strongest institution of its kind in
Australia and one of the strongest in the world.

Re the Queensland National Bank disaster it is
interesting to consider what Premier Nelson said about that
broken-up institution at the time of the ’93 suspension.
In those days he personally overhauled and audited the
Q.N.8., or thought he did. ' Said Nelson : “The duty has
devolved upon me of making a most minute and searching
examination into the affairs of this institution. That I
have done, devoting nearly the whole of my time to it
since the House adjourned about a fortnight ago. I have
given the matter the most thorough and the most search-
ing examination. I have had an opportunity of seeing
all the securities of the bank, and even the confidential
books belonging to that institution. I have also had the
able assistance of my colleague, the Secretary for Lands,
who has had a large experience previously in banking
concerns; and the result of our investigations is that I
am able to report, as I have already reported to my col-
leagues, that, in my opinion, in which my colleague, the
Secretary for Lands, concurs, the assets of the bank,
taken at a fair and reasonable valuation, and assuming
any fair method of realisation, are more than sufficient to
pay the debts of the bank to the Government, as well as
to the outside public. I give that opinion after
the most mature and deliberate consideration,
and after having made myself acquainted and be-
come seized of the whole of the facts connected
with that bank.” Now, considering that the latest
report distinctly implies that the bank wasn’t sound in
’93, despite Nelson’s conclusion, arrived at after “ most
thorough and most searching examination,” and seeing
“all the securities” and being acquainted with “the
whole of the facts ” and with “ most mature and deliber-
ate consideration” on top of all, does Nelson regard him-
self simply as an incompetent financier and his colleague
as a bewildered ass, or what do they both think they are ?
The proposal that the shareholders of the Q.N.
Bank should go out without being called upon to pay up
one farthing of the uncalled capital towards reducing the
shortage, and that the depositors should stand all the loss
that isn’t covered by the money now paid-up, looks more
and more like an awful piece of assurance. The share-
holders, in the ordinary course of affairs, would be called
on to pay the £360,000 still uncalled, and then be sum-
marily ejected because—there still being a deficit of a
million or two in the assets—they have no visible interest
in the concern. There might even be a demand for the
return of the unearned dividends paid since ’93. The
proposal made by, or on behalf of, the shareholders,
is simply that, in return for the unconditional surrender
of the deficiency, and as a reward for letting the deposi-
tors find their own way out of the muddle, which they
had no hand in creating, and as a reward for having the
whole burden of the" Government’s preferential claim
slumped on to them, they are to let the shareholders off
all their liability. Otherwise : “In consideration of me
refusing to account for one sum of money I owe you, you
will let me off paying the other.”
One thing is certain : It is no earthly good put-
ting the Q.N.B. into liquidation if it can be carried on in
some decently honest fashion, even at a big sacrifice.
Liquidation means stopping what income there is, and
even a very bad bank has some kind of liquid business
yielding an income. It means heavy liquidation expenses,
and big legal charges, and the locking-up of what cash
there is, and cash is scarce enough up North just now
without locking-up any more. Also, it means forcibly
putting a vast amount of property into a dreadfully sick
market, some of which property might get better in time,
and doesn’t look as if it could get very much worse. But
unless there are very different managers and very different
management it is better to liquidate ; if anything like the
old crowd is to run the show, the Q.N.B. hasn’t the
shadow of a chance of ever being a decent institution.
* * * *
For the third half-year in succession S.A. Go-
vernment has paid its interest at the Agent-General’s
office without a hitch. The cost is £lOO a year for each
million of the public debt, whereas the bank used to
charge £250 per million. The saving is fully £2OOO a year.
Some of the other provinces still pay over £4OO a year for
the “ management ” of each million of their public debt
the Agent-General, as shown above, could do it for a
quarter the amount, and if Australia was federated, and
there was only one public debt managed by one Agent-
General, it could probably be done for one-eighth the
amount. The saving on this little unconsidered item
alone should be £40,000 a year at the very least —enough
to pay interest and sinking-fund on £1,000,000 of debt.
The fact that “ leading financiers” —the same who demon-
strate the impossibility of a State Bank—proved the S.A..
idea, when first mooted, to be absurd, impracticable,
ruinous, childish, and the invention of somebody quite
ignorant of finance, is only another evidence that leading
financiers are largely liars and fools. Maoriland, by the
way, tried to follow S.A.’s example, and discovered that
her old financiers had so tied up her early loans that the
management can’t be shifted from the Bank of England,
so she goes on being bled as before. The other five pro-
vinces apparently go on being bled because they are
accustomed to it.
* * * *
Victorian 4 per cent, locally-held stock to the
amount of £2,085,000 falls due in about three months, and
Premier Turner proposes to issue new stock in place of
it, probably at 3 per cent. Nothing definite is said about
issuing it locally, but presumably that must be intended ;
Mr. Turner declared some time ago that he intended
in future to rely on the local market, and he is generally
regarded as a man of his word. Moreover, to deliberately
abolish a local stock to replace it by an English one would
be a truly awful example of the blessed virtue of self-
reliance. If a local 3 per cent, loan can be floated at par
it is a decidedly great idea. But if the same loan were
put on the London market, which is very different from
what it was a few months ago when the Westralian 3 per
cent, razzle-dazzle came off so gloriously, it almost cer-
tainly would not fetch par, and the Bull Government
would take £12,500 oijit of it for stamp duty, and banks
and brokers would take at least £12,500 more for expenses,,
and the holders would give none of their interest back in
income-tax as local holders do. Therefore, Turner, like
the other two Treasurers who are on the same lay, if he
really issues at 3 per cent, instead of (say) 3j, is offering
the Victor a i a good deal less than he would probably
have to offer John Bull under the same circumstances.
* * * *
Maoriland offers the first half (J 1500,000) of its

cent.

At the meeting of the Perpetual Executors and
Trustees Association (Melbourne) it was reported that the
sad little institution had realised a profit (for the year,
apparently) of just £52, against losses for the two previous
years of £197 and £204. As The Bulletin's request for a
copy of the balance-sheet was not responded to and the
said document does not appear as usual in the Insurance
and Banking Record, very httle information is a a nab

The National Fire and Marine deal
dividend swallows up £14,706, it naturally followsi that
the co. goes £214 to the bad on the year s work. and the
profit and loss credit-balance goes down from £14,301 to
to £14,087. The unspeakable foolishness of the ™an y,
ment which makes such a sacrifice to keep up its enor
mous dividend is obvious. The National s reserve fund
has faded a great deal of late years through depreciation,
also, its premium income isn t anything like what it was ,
and, though it is still a strong concern, the po cy of pay
ing away every available copper in huge dividends, and
making no effort to reinstate the damaged reserve, may
lead to some more bad shocks in the future.

Cornwall Fire and Marine Insurance Co. (Tas.)
shows a net profit for the past year of £5951. The insur-
ance business yields only £1846 of this, and "he remaining
£4105 is interest realised on the investment of the co. s
own capital, so the Cornwall is doing nothing very mag-
nificent. A dividend of 61 per cent, absorbs the usual
£5OOO, and leaves a total credit balance of £7451. ine
Cornwall has no reserve fund ; it has toiled at the good
work of insuring combustible and sinkable property foi
55 years, and paid £185,000 in dividends, and this accu-
mulated £7451 is all that it has left to show for its labors.
Also the net premium income is £13,281 —not much after
more than half-a-century.

A proposal is on hand for the amalgamation of
the National Mutual Life Association and the Mutual Life
of Victoria. This is the sort of thing which has long
been wanted. There are distinctly too many assurance
offices in Australia for the business which the present
population can supply, and as the result of depression
and over-competition five large offices have shown an
actual decrease in business for several years past. Too
many office premises and managers and staffs in propor-
tion to the available trade also run the expenses far too
high. Amalgamation means making one staff and set of
offices, managers, directors, auditors, advts., &c., do the
work of two, and therefore it means less expense and
bigger bonuses. The National Mutual and the Mutual of
Victoria have both a good reputation, and if they amalga-
mate they will make the second largest office in Australia,
and the 'third largest—the A.M.P. and Maoriland Govt.
Department being first and second—in Australasia. The
benefit to the policy-holders through saving of expenses
should be very considerable, especially to the policy-
holders of the Mutual of Victoria, whose expense rate is
high, and its business, despite the apparent absolute
soundness of the institution, not at all progressive.
* * * *
A few new legal difficulties—about four of them
are alleged to have arisen about the N.S.W. land-tax.
It is claimed (1) that as the Appeal Court was not estab-
lished before the tax-notices were issued as provided by
the Act, these notices are null and void ; (2) that the
Appeal Court, not having been established before the
issue of notices, is null and void also ; (3) that the action
of the Commissioners in privately receiving notices of
objection and adjusting disputes is illegal, because there
is nothing in the Act authorising the Commissioners to
act as a Court of Appeal; (4) that the whole business
needs to be started again from the beginning to put
things on a right basis. This rather sultry legal pro-
nouncement was submitted to Parliament, and Premier
Reid merely stated that he “ had taken a higher opinion.”
But as he didn’t state whether the higher opinion said
that the whole business was really null and void or not,
this didn’t advance things much.

That quaint, old-fashioned concern, the Mutual
Fire Insurance Co., of Tasmania, announces that it is
doing well. This co. never states its premium income,
income from investments, losses or working expenses, to
supply information being incompatible with its old Van-
demonian dignity. In an intricate sort of way, however,
the fact can be dug out of the statement of assets that
the profits seem to be £3770, and the dividend has gone
down from 10 to 8 per cent. Also, the reserve (£10,000)
has been stationary for at least nine years past.

“P. Wentworth,” in S.M. Herald, shows that
the N.S.W. railway-charges on his top-price stock and
tallow came to 24 per cent, gross and 33 per cent, net of

smaller prices would lose 50 per cent, in railway-charges
alone (meaning also that yard-dues, agistment, commis-
sion, losses in transit, rebate to Meatco., &c., must come
out of the other half! 1)

Judge Chomley (Vic.) has decided a point of
some importance to auctioneers and bidders. He held
that where an auctioneer has instructions to conduct a

on credit. That is, it is to be presumed, unless an agree-
ment to the contrary is notified.

Now that the inquisitive blight of the income-
tax is on the Australian merchant he will need to increase
his ledger-keeper’s salary so that a full stomach may still

Economies are necessarily practised in every
possible direction at, and in connection with, the Broken
Hill mines, and, as a result, a good deal of sand-like con-
centrates and ore is sent away loose. Railway trucks at
the best are not water-tight, but those on the Broken Hill
line being rather more open than usual, heavy losses of
metal are complained of. The Junction is the heaviest
loser, chiefly on account of the sandy character of its
ore. ’ The traffic is worth specially catering for, of course ;
but in ordinary circumstances the answer to the com-
plaint would lie that concentrates and fine ore are not
proper things to carry loose. Anyway, the man who
would send away his wheat unbagged and lost it would
win little sympathy ; and wheat has no greater capacity
for “running” than these mine products.
The South is not being rushed for its lovv-in-
silver concentrates, and a big pile is accumulating at the
mine.
There is tremendous rivalry between the Han-
cock and the May jig people, and an army of mine-share-
holding “ barrackers ” has been gathered round each ; but
so far no fair comparative test has been made. Lately
the B.H. Pro. has been making a long series of experi-
ments, and officers generally are said to conclude that for
their purpose the May machines are the more suitable.
The Central is also adopting that class of machine. At
the British, however, the Hancock plant is, as pre-
viously noted, doing exceedingly good work. And the
North, after trying a May plant (erected certainly under
difficulties) has resolved upon adding a Hancock plant.
While “barrackers” for both processes are being ener-
getically whipped up it is as well to remember that much
depends upon the manner in which the product is to be
disposed of. Speaking generally (and that is all that is
possible on account of the extreme variation in the ore),
Hancock’s seems the better adapted for bringing up a
large quantity of ore to a moderate fineness ; May’s for
bringing up a smaller quantity of ore to a higher stan-
dard. And yet if that bold generalisation stands it is
difficult to see why the B.H. Pro., which smelts its own
stuff on or near the mine, should prefer the May—unless
a wholesale shifting of works is contemplated.
The North continues to put out its 000 ft. level
west cross-cut without profitable results or prospects
thereof. Junction North appearances are also, at the
least, no better than they were a couple of months back,
on account of the occurrence of a large intrusion of
country rock. But as good ore-contracts have been made
continued divs. are assured.
Further litigation is probable over the Junction
South (“ Block 41 ”), which, under a new name, the
public are, at time of writing, being invited to subscribe
into.

The Sunday Times understands that the flota-
tion of Barrass and Conley’s property at Cobar is assured,
and congratulates those who have bought the shares. The
writer congratulates those who sold them. Last week the
mine was examined by A. T. Brown, the well-known ex-
pert of the Broken Hill millionaires. Cobar has it that
he is satisfied. Howell is also going to report, it is said.
The mine cleaned up some four or five hundred tons on
Friday last. Result not known at time of writing.

Pambula, N.S.W. “The Jingera Mineral Pro-
prietary has knocked off all hands for a time. It is under-
stood that the closing is not on any account due to want
of first-class ore.” And the good, grandmotherly, child-
like Herald trustingly prints yarns of this sort. The
Bulletin pronounces no opinion on the Jingera Pro-
prietary, but it wouldn’t be surprised to read in the
Herald that it had been closed down because of its
enormous richness—that it was far too rich to work. Big
things were foreshadowed for this mine many times, and
the writer hopes the climax has not at last been reached.
But the public will seemingly get a bit of a rest now, and
it badly wants one.

The Tomingley Gold-mines (Ltd.) is one of the
latest N.S.W. floats in London. Capital £llO,OO0 —£21,000
cash, balance up to 680,000 in shares. The D.T. London
correspondent says the subscription was only limited, and
attributes it to the state of things in London. It is the
same old business, played in the same old way, and is
called mining. Sometimes it does luckily turn out to be
mining, otherwise it is gambling—a game in which the
owners get a little, the promoters and London crowd get
a heap, and the underwriters, or the public, sooner or
later get stuck with shares and the mine.

Tuena, N.S.W., has a “boon,” if not a boom,
within measurable distance. The Amos has gone the
way of most N.S.W. mines, the Golden Dyke and others
are in a state of suspension, but “ a copy of the lease
under the M. on P.L. Act on Mr. Jones’ property has
been registered. The labor conditions require 615 men,
which, if fulfilled, will be a boon to the district.”
Gov. Jerrysmith, of Westralia, states in his large,
indefinite way that W.A. will yet prove to be a marvellous
country, and a lot of discoveries remain to be made there
w'hich will startle the world. The Bulletin agrees with
H.E. Some of the discoveries already made there —the
discovery that the Londonderry had dried up, for instance,
and that Bayley’s Rew'ard had closed, and that a borrow
of £7,000,000 was in prospect—not only startled the world
but flabbergasted it. And when a general winding-up of
the wild-cats sets in, things will probably be discovered
that will make the world’s hair stand up straight.

Premier Forrest lately cabled the Westralian
Agent-General, asking why the awful slump in the share-
market, adding that nothing had occurred locally, or was
likely to occur, to cause depression or to give anxiety.
The A.G. admitted the “lull,” but “there was every
reason to believe ” —good old stock phrase—it wouldn’t be
of much longer duration. Any man acquainted with
Westralian mining who pretends he can’t account for the
slump is a rogue. If he really can’t, then he is an ass—
and a big one. The list of London co.’s working mines in
W.A. numbers over 200. Of these, two mines produce
more gold than all the rest put together. For a long,
wearisome time the Londoners were fooled by “ want of
machinery.” They have now got machinery. Then it
was a railway that was wanted, and they have now got it.
Then it was the water difficulty. That can never be
wholly removed, but water has in many instances only
helped to kill the mine. Within the last three or four
months a number of English co.’s have crushed. Usually
the first was good, the result of accumulation. Share-
holders are now trying to recover from the shock of sub-
sequent crushings. In other cases it has dawned on Bull
that the rich chutes on some of the mines are so narrow
and short that a few crushings will exhaust the show.
Take the Lady Loch. The first 1000 tons was very good
—went several ozs. When the writer said that that
was not a true test he was howled at in Coolgardie.
Shares were then nearly £4. Why are they now down to
265. ? When the public get a list of the failures in W.A.
it will see the reason for Bull’s nightmare. Fortunately
some really great mines have been found on the field, but
the “ cats ” are so numerous that the real slump has not
set in yet.

Boulder Main Reef, 206 tons, 310 oz. It has also
struck telluride ore, and pains are taken to wire that, in
this instance, the telluride is not associated with calcite
to any great extent, “ the gangue being chiefly blue
quartz and rock closely resembling the so-called diorite.”
From which it will be understood that the other telluride
lodes have vanished, as things composed of calcite often
do. Presumably they are now composed of thin air.
* * * *
Wired from Perth that Mr. Modest Maryanski,
in reporting the discovery of telluride ore in the Boulder
Main Reef, declared that this proved beyond doubt the
permanency of the field. The writer will await confirma-
tion of this weird story. Mr. Maryanski is a most able
man. He is a Pole trained at Freiburg, and was after-
wards metallurgist in Russia ; he has filled big mining
positions in the States and Mexico. He is a strong man,
too, or he would have died from the shock of seeing some
of the mines in which the co. he represents became
heavily interested before his advent.
Brown Hill mine (W.A.) is sending SCO tons to
Dry Creek works, S.A. It has had a lot of bad fortune.
Thousands of pounds were thrown away on a worthless
plant, and, worse luck, the ore-body, which Is very rich on
the surface and down to about 180 ft., suddenly changed
into a comparatively barren body largely composed ol
calcite. This news is too horrible for publication in Cool-
gardie, but it is nevertheless true.

Mt. Magnet, W.A., is in a state of collapse.

British Australasian is doing its utmost to
keep up the boom-end of the Westralian log, but is grow-
ing disheartened, now that the permanency and richness
of the field has been established, that the market should

to the company scheme (a million capital) to repel the
ruinous bear.

The Boulder Main Reef mine, Kalgoorlie,
suffers from a name which is usually confounded with
the Great Boulder. It is a block accidentally left out in
the mad rush for leases around the Boulder. As soon as
pegged it was taken over by the Venture syndicate, and
is probably by far the best show of many owned by that
crowd.

Wired East that the condensed-water supply at
Kalgoorlie is in excess of the demand, and is now selling

and bathing purposes.

Mari tana, W.A. “ All three lodes are wide and

the mine is unsold, and unless Bull is as big a milch cow
as ever, he will leave its richness for the benefit of the

Some more alluring samples e - om the Queen of
the Earth mine, the show of a Collar syndicate in W.A.
Stated that it now has upwards of 10,000 worth of rich
specimens in London. A W.A. p per savs, “It is pro-
bable that the prospectors will reel • small 5-head
battery and treat some of the rich s -»ne in sight.”
“ Some” is good. To send rich stone to London after the
Plunderderry and Wealth of Expectations fizzles was a
bold but asinine step; but to put a battery on to the
mine is sheer madness. The object is obviously to sell
the mine, not to kill it.

A W.A. paper reprints an interview with Bayley
nearly three years ago. He finished with, “[ am certain
there is a tremendous future befoe- the mine.” He must,
indeed, have had a great idea of it future to sell a mine
for £6OOO from which he had dollied over 200 toz. It has
still a market-value in London of over £lOO,OOO, but £
shares seldom go below half-a-crown in London, no matter
how ponderous the capital. After that, they drop down
to zero and the liquidator with a .lull, sickening thud,
and the sheriff deals with the mine That end may be a
long way off with Bayley’s, but it o:u. be sc. l coming on
to many other mostly English-owned runes in W.A. with
a mighty rush.

In the Q.N. Bank report “mining scrip” is

posed of gold and silver, a common feature in many M.L.
mines. It is time that gold should be calculated in Aus-
tralia by value and not by ounces. That is the system all
over the world ; any other causes confusion. Croydon
gold is described by ounces, although its value is only
half that of pure gold.

A miner writes from a Westralian field stating

A Bulletin correspondent :—This far-away
Warratta (N.S. W.) district may reasonably expect a boom.
Recent erushings at the one-horse local battery have gone
very well. A trial crushing, Hussley’s East Warrata,
yielded 4oz. sdwt. per ton, and 12 tons from Welsh’s West
Warratta gave a total of 14J40z. The Federal lease pro-
mises good yields when properly worked, also the Brilliant
and others should pay decently. Priest Geologist Curran
has recently visited the district and appears to be favor-
ably impressed with the reefs. The field is most effec-
tually isolated from civilisation : the telegraph-line, be-
tween Milparinka and Wanaaring, goes bung about twice
a week, and if one has important business to transact at
the warden’s office he will most probably find that many-
dutied official away looking after tick in travelling cattle.
The ore is highly mineralised and needs more than battery
treatment. The right class of men are acquiring original
interests in the field. Broken Hill men have got large
holdings; also Premier Kingston, E. W. Hawker, J. 11.
Paterson, E. A. Murphy, and other Melbourne and Ade-
laide men.

A squad of ladies having been elected to
Prahran (Vic.) Board of Advice, people are asking
METEOROLOGY OUT BACK.
SWAGGIE : “Is it a job ye’d be afther givin’ me?”
BOSS: “Season’s too bad, my man. You get rain and I’ll give you a job.”
SWAGGIE: “ Be jabers, whin the Almighty had charge of the weather, we used to get a foine say son now and
thin, but since the astronymists an’ labor mimbers have took charge, the divil a sayson comes
along at all!”
what such Boards have powers to do. One glori-
ous prerogative is to visit schools—which is joy for
the lydies. Another is to grant four holidays in
the year to each school. It needs to be told that
Vic. schools are indebted to the Board for Cup-
day—as public holidays “ for races ” do not apply
to State schools ! One year the Flemington
Board, moved thereto by the W.C.T.U., decided
to deny the holiday to a local school. In con-
sequence thereof the teachers had to put in an
appearance —to solemnly teach the two small
children who alone answered to the muster-roll.
The staff took the contract in turns—the unem-
ployed section taking up a strategic position on
the back fence, which commanded the finest race-
course in the world. The galling item in the inci-
dent was the fact that the two children belonged
to a publican who had a bar on the course, and
who had sent them to school for safe custody.
The board never again denied Cup-day to that
school, and the Prahran lydies may as well note
the fact.

The arrest of the almost-forgotten Sydney
levanter, Armand Jerome, supplies a whole essay
on the art and mystery of getting away. The
common clumsy method of getting away consists
in bolting at full speed for the nearest port, and
rushing, with a pallid expression and a carpet-bag
in each hand, on board the first departing steamer.
Then, if the levanter is not stopped before the
vessel gets away, he is generally blocked at the
first port of call, and brought back. The artistic
way is to lie low in a secluded country spot, and
grow a shaggy beard and let your hair become long,
and get accustomed to thick boots and ancient
clothes, and acquire a coat of sunburn, and learn
the great Australian adjective, and then assume
a swag and patiently fade away into the far west.
If the levanter can drink colonial beer, and play
euchre with appropriate curses, and can walk
without his feet giving out, the chances are that
he may depart steerage in the fullness of time from
Albury or Cooktown, absolutely unnoticed.
Jerome did the first part of this contract all right;
he lay low successfully for months in a cottage not
many miles from Sydney on the Southern line.
But apparently he had no distinct plans beyond
that, and, instead of judiciously going west with a
swag when the first hue and cry was over, he re-
mained till even the police began to be aware of
his existence. The Bulletin has a profound belief
in going west, as the best course for the levanter.
Not only is it better for him—provided, of course,
he doesn’t go west in a bell-topper and a tail-coat
and put up at the best hotels—but it does a little
to open up the country, and promote the develop-
ment of the interior, and do the other things that
the local politician is so anxious about. A steady
stream of absconders would be a godsend to many
a one-horse township lying out on the dusty road
towards the sunset.

The uses and abuses of the bicycle are a
dally feature of the police-news. An anxious
Vic. widower was disturbed the other night by an
unusual sound in bis daughter’s bedroom. Pro-
ceeding to investigate, he arrived in time to see a
young man leap out of the window of that apart-
ment into the back-yard. The father, who had
been a crack runner in his day, reckoned that after
the winding the fugitive would get in his drop
from the first floor back and subsequent scramble
over the yard fence it would be easy to run him
down. But, alas, Romeo sailed away on a bike.
“Send references”: In Sydney it is im-
possible to obtain a situation without good local
reference; all testimonials from other provinces
being looked upon as dubious. Therefore, the
new-comer and the bad egg is constrained to ad-
vertise for a clerk, &c., with a note to send refer-
ences. And when they come, he coolly picks out
the best and tacks them to his own answers to
advertisements.

The crew of the wrecked
Dayspring who recently landed
at Rockhampton had some blood-

Pacific. Sharks continually fol-

water of Long Island, and then
allow the waves to roll them
almost on to the beach, in order
to get the remains of turtle
slaughtered and left there by
the stranded sailors.

medium of Shanks’s pony, leav-
ing each settlement on alternate
Sundays. The railway carries
the mail now a little quicker,
but not much. The mail train
takes nearly 12 hours to accom-
plish the one hundred and
twenty-odd miles. A midnight
stoppage of two hours at a for-
lorn little siding is made, pre-
sumably to allow the engine to
get its second wind, while the
passengers listen to the seduc-

X.Z.: “Coffin-sellers grow more
insistently enterprising daily. Re-
cently one big physician was called
in by a swell hotelkeeper to attend a
foreign gentleman, suddenly taken ill.
Death occurred same night, and the
widow, a stranger in a strange land,
sought counsel of the doctor, who,
pitying, mentioned a certain grave-
filler. A few days after, a fine fat
turkey was left at Dr. Galen’s door,
with the compliments of Mr. Dash
Blank, undertaker, &c., 0001 Asterisk-
street, Querybourne. Evidently an
illustration of the aphorism that grati-
tude is a lively sense of favors to
come. Now the other side. A poor
governess died in a school, and, as
soon as the breath left her, the doctor
in attendance hauled from his pocket
a handful of the cards of a certain
undertaker, and pressed one on the
head-teacher. The undertaker was
employed, but the doctor will never
see the inside of that school again.”

and with but about 4,000,000 acres of
land alienated, can boast more ruins

Cheap labor—a man cost the settler
but from £1 to £9 per annum —en-
couraged the erection of palatial
mansions on small estates. When
wheat fell from pounds to shillings per
bushel, and prices generally came
down by the run, the up-keep of the mansions
was no longer possible. Hence the hundreds of
crumbling ruins, where the swallows build in safety
and the mopokes hoot at night.

Cheerful items from the report of the Vic.
Presbyterian General Assembly committee on the
state of religion :
The masses were as worldly and pleasure-loving as ever,
and the rush to all kinds of amusement knew no abate-
ment. It was lamentable to know that a very large
number of young men had no vital connection with the
church of their fathers. The following hindrances were
referred to :—Sunday trains and steamboats, a disposition
among young men on the Sabbath to go cycling, and read-
ing works of fiction on the Lord’s Day. The Minister and
Commissioner of Railways had been communicated with,
protesting against the running of Sundaj' excursion trains
to Healesvillc, Ferntree Gully, and Bacchus Marsh. With
a view to united action on questions affecting the moral
and religious welfare of society the following subjects were
brought forward :—Art unions, Sunday trading, religious
instruction in State schools, the employment of barmaids,
the Divorce Act, and the duty of endeavoring to stop such
theatrical performances as have an unchaste and immoral
tendency. Decided : That influence be used at the next
general election to secure the return of members of Par-
liament pledged to support the reading of Scripture-
lessons in State-schools, and that a list of queries be sent
to congregations.
A list of queries ! That ought to settle the matter.
One query : “ Ha’ ye forgoten the collaikshun ? ’
Another : “Is your dochter teachin’ theology to a
Chinaman and lairnin’ to ride a bicycle? ”
One of the most pro-
minent Vic. advocates of
the age-of-consent system
has just had to foot a
handsome blackmail bill

The most gorgeous insolvent this country
lias ever seen appeared the other day in Sydney
Bankruptcy Court to state that his liabilities were
various and assets nil. His evidence (as reported
in Sydney D.T.) reads like a hunk from a W.A.
mine prospectus :
He came to N.S.W. about 15 months ago, in the Ormuz,
travelling second-class. He brought out with him an
amount of £2OOO in Bank of England notes, which lie
carried in a licit. His father was Henry Lambert, mem-
ber of Parliament 25 years ago for the county of Wexford,
as well as deputy-lieutenant of the county, ami a justice
of the peace, His father’s income came from his own
private estates, which were principally in Ireland. Bank-
rupt was educated by a private tutor, and then went to
the London University, lie was in two railway accidents,
and was laid up for 18 months. He took over some pro-
perties worth about £400,000, when he was 21 years of
age, to avoid the legacy duties, and had since been paying
off the mortgage upon them. He had made a good deal
of money in arranging loans. He made £40,000 in one
transaction. He raised a loan of £700,000 for a MI
Salamons, from Martin’s Bank, in Lombard-street, through
his friend Charlie Morrison, who was wort h £27,000,000.
Bankrupt got the £40,000 in cash, and with it bought
tlie equity of redemption of land at Woodford. He, how-
ever, had £7OOO returned to him for giving up a little
ditch. After this, he lost £30,000 in a mine in California.
He had been staying at the Hotel Metropole whilst m
Sydney, hut when his address became known lie had such
a lot of people calling on him with gold specimens, and
claiming relationship with him, that he left, and went to
live quietly at a coffee-palace. One man, who said he got
remittances from home, tint whose remittance had been
delayed, obtained £37 from him, and bankrupt never saw
him again. Bankrupt had nothing now but his clothes.
He went to Tasmania last November, and inspected every
mine in the colony.
This vast person who has been in the habit, with-
out an effort, of knowing people worth ,£27,000,000
and calling them “ Charlie,” evidently broke down
as the natural result of coming to these “beastly
kawlinies. ”

Dear Bulletin, —The curse of the
“ guinea-a-set ” man is strong in the
land, while all over Australia many
eminent and accomplished molar-mer-
chants are practically starving behind
their brass-plates. One Southern dental
assassin now cabs it from door to door
and books orders. It is this fiend’s
custom to extract everythin!i. .Slightly-
decayed teeth are ruthlessly dislodged
to make way for “ our lovely guinea
seats, Madam,” and he smilingly col-
lects a deposit and passes on to the
victim next door. Nearly every
chemist puts out his little show-case,
and, he, too, under the proposed N.S.W.
Dental Act, will claim recosrnition at
the hands of the Dental Board because
he once had occasion to drop the iodo-
form spatula to extract a temporary
canine for Smith’s nurse-girl. If the
framers of the Act now before Parlia-
ment had an inch of backbone they
would nail their colors to the mast of
a (Bill which would compel every non-
diplomued man in N.S.W. to undergo
an exam, before being allowed to prac-
tice. Then, should the Bill be rejected,
the province’s maxillae may go to Sheol,
and it will be at liberty to call in the
local blacksmith to treat the next case.

the tidal - wave of dental quackery
knocked him under, and lie’s now scrub-
cutting on the Bogan. —J.S.S.

The Boggabri (N.S.W.) Indian-
hawker murder recalls an E. Coast,
Tas., incident. A mere stripling shot
an Assyrian, concealed the body, and
plundered the effects. He burnt most
of these, keeping some pipes and
“ flash ” jewellery, which he presented to
male and female friends. Detection soon
followed, but the death-sentence was
commuted to “ life,” and, at the present
time, the shooter languishes in Hobart
Gaol. This affair scared the hawkers
for a time—but that phase did not last
long, as they recognised and traded on
the protection of the State.

Victoria proceeds to abolish that
old British law whereby a magistrate can
order that the body of a suicide shall be
hustled secretly into the ground at night

ney-General Isaacs who drafted it. A
Jew in search of Christian burial seems
a bit incongruous.

THANKS TO TASMANIAN BRETHREN.
(To the Editor of Mason it, yJ
Dear Sir and Brother,— Having occasion to visit Laun-
ceston the week before last on business, and finding my-
self a stranger in a strange land, I had the opportunity of
feeling what true Masonry is. On meeting a brother
named J. C. Roycraft, J.P., the Resident Secretary of the
Australian Widows’ Fund, he not only assisted me in my
business, but very kindly placed his steam launch and
horse and buggy at my disposal, and also invited me to
his house, where his wife and daughter treated me right
royally and made me feel as if we had known each other
for years, and I can assure you I was sorry when my time
came to leave ; it was the first occasion that we had met,
and my sincere wish is that I shall again have the plea-
sure of seeing them. I also received a very cordial recep-
tion from Bro. Gilmore, the M.P. for Beaconsfield, and
Bro. Colgrave, the proprietor of the Ophir Hotel of that
place. I had no time to visit any of the lodges, but from
what I hear they are more particular who they admit into
the Order than we are in Victoria. The Masonic Hall is a
very substantial building and situated in a very nice part
of Launceston. Taking the residents as a body, they are
extremely slow, all waiting for something to turn up. If
any brethren are visiting the place, I shall be only too
pleased to give them an introduction to Bro. Roycraft,
who is one of those Masons you do not meet with every
day. I had the. pleasure of seeing your paper there.
Yours fraternally, Alex. Phillips. 129 Swanston-street,
14th May, 1896.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Nov. 24, 1896.
Mr Dear Myee—
The new Victoria (Sydney Ladies’) Club was
opened last Thursday under moist circumstances.
A damp and dripping crowd struggled out of rain-
cloaks and clashed umbrellas wildly in the passage
to the detriment of the hitherto untrodden pro-
prietary carpets, shook hands with hostesses on
the staircase and inspected the premises, or
listened to music in the drawing-room. At the
first assembling of a club the ice cannot be ex-
pected to be broken, and the guests wandered
about in a sorrowful way, or backed nervously in
among the crowd, wondering at the musical feats
of a certain infant. Some chatterers on the out-
skirts of a listening group made a foreign recitress
look so angrily at them that I am sure she was
thinking things about them in Trench. I feel
tired already of all the convulsions there are going
to be, because some members will talk when others
are performing, and then nobody will ever sing or
recite again if anybody deliberately tries to drown
her voice. And everybody will walk out of the
room when anybody begins to warble, and notices
to be silent will be posted up and totally ignored.
And several other things.
Social par-writers, you may observe, trium-
phantly note that there were Men at Thursday’s
gathering. There were also roses, refreshments,
and many of the Nicest, including two Misses
-Brand, bringing a mild and self-repressive family-
manner with them. Dressing was variegated, on
account of the weather. Some of the gay muslin-
clad women looked like draggled birds of paradise,
others in blouse and skirt flattened their noses
against the side window-panes, and gazed wist-
fully through the teeming rain on the Phillip-street
tennis-court, which was to have come into their
plan had the day been fine. A chatty visitor
brought up the tone of the whole party by airing
his overwhelming acquaintance with the British
nobility ; the air absolutely scintillated with glit-
tering fragments of “ Burke’s Peerage.”
A general dampness prevailed everywhere last
W f e .r W hen the weather took up, the first night
of the Ironmaster,” at the Lyceum, reduced a
sympathising audience to sniffs and tears, and a
weeping d.c. enthusiastically waved its moist
handkerchief at the performers after the curtain
fell and rose again. Mrs. Potter, as Claire de
Beaulieu, has a part necessitating her sitting a
good deal on a couch in several different costumes.
All her gowns match the yellow plush of the sofa,
and are very fetching. Her best blue silk frock is
quite visible above the shoulders, both back and
ront, and keeps on ” without that firm whale-
bone skeleton which some inquiring minds found
to be the support of the inscrutably abbreviated
black satin gown of Francillon. Daring touches
of absinthe-green chiffon on the blue dress—the
only cerulean tint in the play, by the way, for the
Ironmaster is quite mild —and beetle-wing em-
broidery with velvet bows make an artistic
'V'd ? fc sta £ e women upholster themselves ;
fU rC', P - dresses her part. Linda Raymond, as
the Duchess, looks rather like an animated draw-
ing-room suite in her toniest frock, but gets exactly
the right effect of not being exactly chic in her
bunday frock of purply-striped silk fashionably
confected with etceteras.
The wedding-scene set was applauded on the
first night. I here are tones of scarlet in a dark-
green room with yellowish-brown furniture : also
the whole act is a lesson in French wedding eti-
quette. ihe men are all in full dress. French
bridegrooms always look like waiters, and wear
their swallow-tails all the festal day. Brides don’t
believe m giving their white satin only an hour’s
existence, and they, too, wear their finery all day.
So that is why Claire stands pale and haughty,
like a wax figure in a hair-dresser’s window, in
her pretty bridal white, while Kyrle Bellew, as
the wronged bridegroom, denounces her. If she
only had to run off and get into her travelling
dress it would save a domestic wrangle. It is
unusual for Kyrle to do the storming while Mrs.
P. stands quietly by ; in all their other plays if
there s any storming to be done Mrs. Potter is
right there, and the gentleman gets a down
worried expression which seems to appeal to every
married man in the house. By the way, the red-
plush footman has been convincingly top-loftv
through two plays now, and I throw in a note of
admiration for his haughty demeanour in carrying
mit the Beauheu electro-plate in the first act. In
a INice family such a menial would add a century
to the household pedigree.
The swagger luncheon on board the Yamashiro
Maru last Friday, has set people praising the
supremacy of Japanese cooking. But the Jap at
home has only the most primitive kitchen arrange-
ments. He is quick and adaptive and soon learns
to fix up European dishes for tourists. He himself
is a dainty feeder and eats hardly any meat. He
likes fish, fresh-caught and raw, straw-colored tea.
blends sweets with salmon and drinks safe - , a spirit
which makes him giddily drunk for a quarter of
an hour and then dies out of him. He is never
dull or heavy through over-gorging. A Chinese
P°P, prepare a more elaborate meal than any-
body, but the eater has to swallow it in faith with-
Vin S^ eCtl ”?.u he ki ,* chen > or hi s appetite would
be killed. Chows can eat anything. In the
Canton market rats are a staple, fattened on the
execution-ground, where they swarm over the
skulls and bones of the victims of the law.
Resuscitated “ Chinatown ’’makes Her Maiestv’s
festive once more. On Monday there were some
ingredients of a brilliant d.c. A beauty-bride in
blushful rose-pink with a wreath of roses on her
hair and a little curl in the middle of her forehead
was stared at as much as the stage-folk, and the
husband bore it as became the bridegroom of a
sensation wedding. Bessie Clayton’s fire-dance is
°.. y novelty—a large black void streaked by a
whirling figure kicked about by two muscular
lavender legs and fluttering voluminous garments
in different-colored limelights—like a whole fleet
of ships flying all their signal flags at once in dirty
weather. It is called a “ fire-dance ” because
there is no illusion of flames, and Bessie doesn’t
dance—she only contorts. The “Firm” is em-
phasising the revival by issuing artistic souvenir
programmes.
A raven-haired Sydney woman, turning out her
w/r S iu » s a fter his recent little flutter to
Meib. to see the Cup,” came upon a parcel
sacredly wrapped in fine tissue-paper. It contained
a long lock of fine chestnut hair. That husband
lelt things a little frigid on his return home that
evening, and the coolness was settling down into a
regular frost until it transpired that the cause of
the anguish was in reality a lock of the victorious
JNewhaven s mane.
Mrs. Coke, the American woman-lawyer, is a
bright, active woman who speaks very pronounced
Amurnkan.” Visiting a friend’s house, she
heard our “ locusts ” for the first time in the
garden, and was so much taken with their ear-
piercmg shriek that she had two caught for her.
Going she suddenly exclaimed, “Sakes alive, I
clean forgot those bugs.” So the “bugs” were
put in a paper bag and carried off.
The Sydney Anglicans are much exercised in
mind over the special recognition of Presbyterian-
ism by Gov. Hampden. Shortly after the cable
informed us that Queen Victoria and the Czar
knelt together in some Presbyterian Church —as a
sort of mutual concession to Anglican suscepti-
bilities and Greek exclusiveness—H.E. and suite
attended worship at St. Stephen’s Presbyterian
Giiurch, Phulip-street. It was only the other day
that the Governor advocated the erection of new
seats in St. James’ Church. It is rumored that
the Koman Catholics are trying to get him to hear
Mass at St. Mary’s Cathedral.

A picture chess-board has been designed and
executed by a Sydney lady artist. The squares
are landscapes m oil, alternated with silver-grey
ones. Ihe tiny scenes are mostly on “the
harbor, and are charmingly painted. As the
board is framed and glazed, it is practicable, and
is calculated to give players a sensation of travel-
fing at breakneck-speed over miles of country as
they lift their pawns across the little brooklets
and over the tree-tops and hills.
With bicyclists there are only two kinds of
people in the world those who “bike ” and those
who don t. Lately many souvenirs of dramatic
co. s have been issued containing photos, of

Mothers of attractive headstrong daughters
are sometimes tempted to envy other people their
ugly docile ducklings. That too-managing Melb.
matron is still remembered who, some years agone
kept each of her dashing daughters engaged six-
deep so as to guard against any possible defection.
In the end, one of them achieved by far the most
brilliant match ever made by an Australian-born,
while the other, even before her widowhood, had
to earn her own bread and butter.
Melb. milliners assert that the expenditure on
hats and bonnets this season almost touched boom-
year s record. Head-pieces were never more ex-
pensive, by reason, amongst other things, of the
vast quantities of trimmings that even the most
modest chapeau requires now-a-days ; the demand
lor high-priced millinery surprised and delighted
those in the trade. Women, who a year or two
ago would have ‘ done ’ the lawn with a paltry
guinea s worth of flowers and feathers on their
heads cheerfully gave five or six and even eight
sovs for head-gear this season. New arrivals
cruelly declare that the bonnet-show at Fleming-
ton would be considered distinctly vulgar by smart
Londoners or chic Parisians, and that the gaudy
style of hat-architecture has disappeared in Paris
and passed to ‘ ’Arriet ’ in ‘the little village.’
Certainly those confections sent out by the best
English and Continental houses made an emphatic
appeal for less grotesque shape and more subdued
tints ; indeed, a most expensive bonnet, imported
straight from Paris, was an innocent-looking little
affair composed of white straw with a couple of
deep-pink roses and a heron’s top-knot in it.
The Austral Salon meeting on Thursday even-
ing last would serve as an excellent model of an
evenings entertainment for the Svdney club
which seems to be following in the" wake of the
A.S. so slavishly As even the faults and imper-
fections of the Melb. club are being reproduced in
the Sydney one, it would be worth the new club's
while to take a note when the original does a
thing unusually well. The evening was filled with
music, recitation, and high-class refreshments and
rounded off with a reading from Ibsen’s ‘Lady
Ingher of Ostrat. ’ The ‘ Carl of Norraway ’ has
been having a day out at the Salon lately. Some
short time ago the members were ‘wrastling’ with
the obscurities in the ‘ Master Builder ’ and up-
holding Hilda Wangel as the type of modern
girlhood. Countless dreary meetings on this
alleged intellectual gathering-ground have severely
scared mere males away from women’s literary
societies of every sort, and it is only pleasant and
entertaining gatherings like last Thursday’s which
will lure them back.
Jo i eph Bmnchi, Turkish Consul for
W., met an enviable doom at Trinity Church,
balaclava, on a recent Wednesday, when he married
iss Alice Hale, the pretty and wealthy daughter
of Mrs. J Craven, of Carleon, St. Kilda. The
bride, in white satin and chiffon with a spreading,
billowy tail-piece, was backed up by two maids in
dolly-look, ng frocks of blue muslin with white
fichus and white picture hats. A great number
of Sydneysiders were present at the ceremony,
which was followed by an elaborate ‘ wedding-
tea ihe display of wedding-presents received
by the happy pair included a sheaf of most digni-
tied-looking cheques.
“ Miss Emily Hughes is distinctly the sweetest-
looking Katharine that George Rignold has ever
had She wears her pretty dark hair simply
paited and a little curl in the middle of her fore-
head, and makes Kate look an innocent-eyed little
maiden of sweet 17. The majestic blue velvet
robe, glittering with golden fleur de lys, she wears
over a pretty white and pale-blue satin under-
c ress. Miss Watts-Phillips looks historically
correct in gold-colored satin and long white veil.
r. Hubert Parry’s ‘Judith,’presented for the
first time m Australia at Melb. Town Hall by the
local Philharmonic Society, is undoubtedly a
strong oratorio of the second class, with plenty of
room for dramatic effects in its solos, and a good
deal of martial movement in its choruses; also a
fair amount of barbaric noise in the incidental
music. Hie subject is steeped in battle, murder
massacres, and pillaging*. As far as two choruses
in black and white could manage it they gave an
e ective representation of these horrors. Madame
Limly Spada made a telling enough Judith
vocally, to subjugate the most unrelenting Holo-
fernes. Miss Odell Fawcett, when once she had
got on good terms with the orchestra, let her
dramatic contralto have its own way ; but she
needs to speak her words more distinctly. Philin
Newbury had plenty of scope in his solos, and the
last one brought the house fairly down with a
ravishing top note. The audience was large and
cordial, and would have been bigger still but for
tbe attractions of the fire raging in Little Flinders-
street Many women even in quasi evening-dress
turned their semi-bare backs upon the oratorio at
the last moment and begged their escorts to take
them off to view the flames.
In one Australian city, vice-regal festivities
are enlivened by the gallantry of the host, who
sustains himself on the hospitality tread-mill by
occasional fatherly pattings and chuckings of his
prettier girl-guests. The recipients themselves
accept their privileges unwmkingly, though, if
they took the advice of their maiden aunts and
eider sisters, the ballroom would resound with
feminine screamings and skurryings whenever his
Ex. hove in sight.
rece v t , Pr esbyterian General Assembly
(Melb.) was lively as in the days of the Strong
riots, what with the scunnering ’ and ‘ fechting ’
of meenisters on the question of Presbyterian
Union and Christian Brotherhood. The same
week the Salvationists held a grand mission cor-
roboree and dedicated their flesh wholesale as
cannibal hash for the Melanesian heathen,
bunds, by the way, were the lions in the path of
Presbyterian federation, which was carried at
last amidst threats of disruption and secession.

„fi° V ‘ U . X^on ,' B , e^er daughter, Mrs. Ponsonby.
i her husband (a tall, handsome parson) and
ieir small son, arrived in Adelaide by the Austral,
lhey held family worship’daily in their cabin,
and two doors off four priests followed suit in
leirs. Ihe latter also celebrated Mass every
morning in the drawing-room for the benefit of six
nuns ; and parson Ponsonby, aided by a Scotch
apostle, conducted weekly services on deck. A
snocking contrast to his zealous brethren was a
c ergyman on board who frisked incog, among the
laity the whole voyage. No one suspected his
vocation until the day they landed in Melbourne,
when he emerged from his cabin in full clerical
war-pamt.
, A curious will is that of a recently-deceased
Melb. spinster, who left £BOO of her hard-earned
tC \ th<! for the protection of animals,
300 to a friend, and <£s per annum to a relation
who had given her a home for 25 years. Cats and
dogs were her hobby. Some people thought she
owed her mortal disease to her constant associa-
tion with them ; but, at all events, she was always
trotting up lanes and diving under bridges with
parcels of food for homeless curs, or carrying
diseased mongrels to the nearest chemist for
treatment or merciful release. One of her pecu-
liarities was to induce cabmen and such like to
adopt stray animals, and then visit them weekly
and scold them for fancied defects in their treat-
ment of the waifs.
Gulliver,’ the dwarf comic singer, was ‘dis-
covered by dentist Merrill. The Dr. met the
little chap, who was in woefully bad case a short
time ago, and on hearing him sing some Irish
songs took him to Williamson, who engaged him
for the Djm-Djin ’ season. ‘Gulliver,’ whose
real name is Rum bellow, much resembles‘Little
J-ieh, the famous English dwarf, in ‘business ’ and
appearance. He is the hit of the resuscitated Jap.
bogey, and secured four or five encores nightly for
his unique performance. He is 22 years of age
and two inches shorter than the celebrated Toni
Ihumb.

Premier Reid (says a Bulletin corre-
spondent) was successfully initiated into the
preliminary mysteries of Freemasonry at Lodge
Centennial (Sydney) the other night. Brother
rteid says it was not nearly so terrible as he
had feared. Boaz is nothing; wait till Brother
Keid knows all about Tubal-Cain. The lod-e has
specially enlarged Hiram Abiff’s grave for him
and every Mason in Sydney has got the date of
his third degree m his note-book and has regis-
tered a solemn vow to be there to see the fun.
Newly - appointed S.A. Police Commis-
sioner Madley had a peculiar experience at Melb
Cup meeting. He went over with Howe,
M.L., and shared a hotel dressing-room with a
Queensland squatter. Madley saw a purse on the
tabJe which was a fac simile of his own and put it
in his pocket. “ Give me that purse, ,f said the
squatter, “or I’ll get the police ! ” Madley saw
ins mistake and returned the purse with profuse
apologies, but it took some time to satisfy the
squatter that he had not fallen among thieves.

James Patrick Gar van, manager of the
Citizens’ Life Assurance Co., of Sydney, and an
ex-Mimster of Justice of N.S. Wales, died last
week, aged 53, to the great regret of a wide circle,
lie was born in Ireland, arrived in N.S.W. when
but four years old, and after a bright school career
addressed himself to the study of law—which he
abandoned, when Hill End rush broke out, to
manage mining companies. For many years he
represented Eden in N.S.W. Assembly in con-
junction with Mr. Henry Clarke, and while in
Parliament successfully made a speciality of
financial criticism. He was a man of fine
phymque and the steadiest of habits, an accom-
plished oarsman and good all-round athlete, but
died within a month after it was definitely dis-
covered that he was afflicted with internal cancer.
Mr. Gar van leaves 12 children.

Coroner Toul’s father, the Rev. John
Yaul, first chaplain stationed in Northern Tas-
mania (George Town, 1819) was a man of many
parts. In 1809 he was sent to convert the raging
Heathen in the South Seas. Presumably, the
natives couldn’t stand his jokes, for they shut him
up to fatten for a cannibal feast. But feed him
as they would, the Tahitians could not induce the
lean parson to put on flesh; so they gave it up in
despair, promising the Rev. John his liberty on
condition that he shaved 20 of them without
drawing blood. He accomplished the task, and
lived to tell the tale—with clerical embellishments.

The late John E. Kelly, one-time jour-

Edward Dyson, the other day, very nearly

Premier Reid has been offered a knight-

Imperialism to brand every valuable beast as soon

The real reason why a veteran pressman
left a daily paper is being whispered around.
There are a spiritualistic stance, a rich widow, a
bundle of anonymous letters, and a leading banker
in the affair. It is a curious story.
Their Supreme Court Honors Big and
Little Simpson, of N.S.W., are appropriately ad-
justed. It takes a six-footer to face a divorce
battery, but a five-footer is quite large enough to
deal with disheartened bankruptcy.
When Dr. Ullathorne, formerly well-known

“ Sammy” Lees’ prophecy about Sydney’s
Lord-Mayoralty goes for wind this year, but the

Judge A’Beckett, of Victoria, has an un-
conquerable antipathy to apples in any shape, and
the smell of them is sufficient to make him ill. He
has been seen to hurriedly leave a tramcar in order
to avoid a grimy small boy who was gnawing a
pippin.
Barristers must be 10 years at the Bar to

Representative inmates of Melb. Benevo-

Leg. Assembly, who holds a life railway-pass ; a
Crimean veteran, an aide-de-camp of Garibaldi, a
once wealthy squatter, and another broken capi-
talist, who is called “ Pannikins,” because he
makes them for the Asylum.
Gov. Fitzroy, who was mercilessly slang-
whanged at the Bathurst Convention, and whom
the chubby Kidd designated “a disgraceful
brute,” left N.S. Wales, it should be borne in
mind, amid tokens of admiration and regret as
effusive and universal as those spent on the gush-
ing Carington. Fitzroy, moreover, was presented
with a purse of 2000 sovereigns by the grateful,
weeping parents of many who now defame him.
EVEN THE KANGAROOS HAVE TAKEN TO IT.
The Geelong solicitor convicted of forg-
ing numerous signatures to mortgage deeds,
was sentenced to 6| years’ imprisonment in all.
Which seems quite a lot of punishment for a Vic-

for any member of that brotherhood who goes
wrong just now.
Music-Professor Marshall Hall is unique
in Melbourne University as the only “ professor ”
who has no university degree and never had any
university training. Hence, probably, his marked
success as a teacher. Mining-lecturer Ferdinand
Moritz Krus6 is likewise the only “lecturer”
totally devoid of a university degree, his only addi-
tions being F.L.S., F.G.S. (Fellow of the Linnsean
Society and of the Geological Society, both of
London).

Myers a good
second. Wil-
loughby it was
who said that
Augustus had
found Rome
brick and left
it marble, to
read next day
that he had
“found Rome

other pressmen
who run Wil-
loughby close are
Robinson, city
editor, and
Schuyler, chief
of staff of the
Age. Robinson,
the setting of
whose copy is
always paid for
at special rates,
once left a note
for Schuyler,
who, unable to
decipher it, re-
addressed it to a
reporter, who
bore the reputa-
tion of being able
to read cunei-
form characters
with ease, asking
him to tran-
scribe and return
the memo. But
the unfortunate
recipient was
utterly incap-
able of making
head or tail of
either communi-
cation, and wan-
dered about the
office all day
with one in each
hand, wondering
whether he had
been sacked or
given a rise in
salary.
About the smartest pickpocket in Aus-

Among the next batch of appointees to

Misther Burgin at a Melb. St. Patrick’s
hall meeting :
I am glad to see Mr. Hunt took home a message of
peace if it was not altogether harmonious. Mr. Hunt
acted without instructions, and, therefore, I may say he
carried out his instructions satisfactorily.” (Ore&t
applause).
Agent-General Playford (S.A.) cannot be
accused of “ big head.” “Thos. Playford, market-
gardener, Morton’s Summit,” is the legend on
spring-drays frequently seen on Adelaide Block.
Playford’s renown as a vegetable-man earned him
the nickname of “Tomato Tom” when in S.A.
Assembly.
An Irish Judge relates that in his court on
one occasion lately, when the crier called out as
usual, “ Gentlemen of the jury, take your proper
places in the court,” seven of them instinctively
walked into the dock. Which is an old N.S.W.
story, told by Dailey and others of a N.S.W. horse-
stealing case.
To this has it come ! Sydney D.T., re-
porting re the Bathurst Convention: “ Mr. D.
O’Connor, M.L.C., filled in the ten minutes that
remained before the adjournment for the garden-
party in praising Bathurst and everybody con-
nected with it, as well as the speakers who had
preceded him.”
Cheok Hong Cheong, boss Chinese Chris-
tian of Australia, used to run a fruit-shop in
Brunswick-street, Pitzroy (Melb.), studying at
Melb. University in his off time. Cheong, it was,
who, as an elder of the kirk, publicly told Vic.
Presbyterian Assembly that it could get better
money-value christianising the heathen of Fitzroy
than wasting its shekels on China Inland Missions.
Dear Bulletin,—l heard Chief Justice
Madden’s charge to the jury in a much-discussed
“ age-of-consent ” case. Why is it that no one
has done justice to this man’s marvellous sweet-
ness of language? Voice, manner, phrase—all the
grace of perfect oratory. Gaunson had delivered
a (Characteristic attack on Parliament for the
“ age-of-consent ” legislation. The Chief Justice
characterised it as “a speech that would be power-
ful everywhere, that would be appropriate any-
where but in a court of justice.” Then he said :
“We have heard that Love laughs at locksmiths;
it is also true that Love laughs at laws. ” Then he
contrasted the boy in the dock with a “seasoned
seducer,” and so went on to the close of an address
that seemed to be all music, in spite of the thou-
sand tawdry details involved in the case.—F.
SHE HADN'T 'EM ALL ON.
INEXPERIENCED HOTEL PROPRIETOR (who has advertised for a barmaid, to

Paddy Swift, an aboriginal who has earned
good gate-money at Sydney mission meetings for
some time past, was married the other day to a
half-caste lady from Walgett, Miss Emily
Manager—a name which has its implications.
Patrick seems to be more or less in the stable of
professional-philanthropist Ardill, and is almost
as good a platform draw as the defunct Chinese
choir used to be. The glare in his eye, as shown
in the accompanying photo., when he tells how
desperately King Billy of the backblocks cries to
his white sisters to gib it salvation, rarely fails to
corkscrew the shy threepenny bit from its lair in the
garments of the female votaries of the local branch
of the Ebenezer Grand Junction Society for Re-
forming the Old Man, P. Swift, however, who is
now boss of the Warangesda aboriginal mission
station on the Murrumbidgee, is rather a decent
fellow, barring his gift of slushy gab. But when he
pathetically asseverates that all that is necessary
to the success of the aboriginal missions—mostly
peopled by half-castes—is to keep the promiscuous
white male 10 miles from the boundary, the chair-
man generally squashes him with an announce-
ment of the 107th hymn. His bride, who is 26
(Paddy is 48), is less known to charitable fame,
but the male-reporter of the wedding says she wrs
“ rather superior-looking ” in a “ costume of some
light material 99 which he couldn’t specify, ‘ 6 with a
large pink pattern on a white ground,” and white
flowers in her hair. And The Bulletin honestly
wishes her good luck, and metaphorically scatters
several large handfuls of rice ove*r her portrait
herewith.
The Christmas Number of The Bulletin
will be published on December 12. It will be better
illustrated than any other paper ever published
in Australasia, and will contain a vast amount of
original matter of universal interest by Aus-
tralian writers old and new. Also, it will no*
contain a single second-hand, stolen or cheap-
German block. In fact, it will not contain one
line, either of reading or illustration, not specially
done for the paper. Single copies, post free, to

The N.S.W. Opposition is quite tired of
W. Nicholas Willis, Esq., and thinks of asking
him to “ git ” from the Opposition rooms.
Griffith is much nettled over the Q. Leg.
Council’s shelving of the Federation Bill. Had

He dreaded the Referendum.
“ Popocrat ” is Yankee for a blend of
Populist and Democrat. It is now sought to

“ Freesock ” Party—from its mixture of Freetrade
and Socialism.
“I will never raise the land-tax higher
than Id. in the £5l, ” said the valiant Premier
Reid several times, in the first flush of his land-
tax. Wonder what he thinks about it now, while
the assessment ructions are going ?
See how the potentates trooped after each
other to the Bathurst Convention —by one, by two,
by three, by the dozen ! The alleged big men
were just as greedy for advt. as the unknowns. In
a month, the whole affair will be a Soudan Donkey.
Professor Gosman, at the Bathurst Con-
vention : “ Australian senators should be men who
have done service in the field or made the name of
Britain great.” Very well, then. British M’sP.
should be men who’ve made Australia great. The
bullfroggery of it !
Sydney Telegraph put its foot in it very
badly a few days back. A muddled cablegram
was read to mean that the Canadian Parliament
had suddenly seen the evils of Protection, and
had abolished the protective duties and gone in
for Free-raid at one jump. The D.T., in its eager-
ness for signs of the glorious spread of Shoddy,
swallowed it all, and roared in a leading article
about the progress of enlightenment and the up-
heaval of the whatsisname and the dawning of the
great thingamy, and so on. Next day a very
obscure par stated that it now appeared the
Canadian Parliament had prorogued six weeks
ago, and wouldn’t meet again for six months,
therefore these beautiful things couldn’t have hap-
pened, but they would probably happen by-and-
bye, and then, &c., &e.
Caldwell, M.P.(S.A.),
in opposing the colored Im-

on the score of “ human-

yellow man as his brother.
“Ah,” said Kingston, “ you

brother-in-law. ”
A cry from Melbourne
Beacon :
It is only the wall of tariffs
between the English-speaking
nations that prevents them all
joining in one mighty union.
The kingdoms ol the whole
earth will become one, the
federation of the world will
take place, and man to man
the world o’er shall brothers
be, as the last tariff of man
against man disappears. The
day that men learn that the in-
terests of all men are identical
and intertwined, and that it is
safe to trust in the law' of uni-
versal brotherhood, that day
will be signalised by the ob-
literation of the term “Protec-
tion ” from the vocabulary of
nations.
This explains it all, of
course. It is because there
is no tariff between them
that the English Tory and
the Irish Nationalist are
like brothers, and the fact
that there is absolute Free-
trade within the IT. S. which
made the Confederate and
the Federal love each other
so much that 656,000 of
them were killed, and the
mutual admiration of the
Russian and Pole and the
Turk and Armenian both
arise from the absence of
commercial barriers be-
tween them. Blessed is he
who knows all about every-
thing, and whose one single
fad oan put the whole world
to rights. Amen.
Millen, M.P. for Bourke, N.S.W.: “If
the electors knew what went on in Parliament in
the case of the election of a member to the Public
Works Committee, they would never trust Par-
liaments to elect the members of an Australian
Senate.”
So, according to president Machattie, the
Australian Commonwealth is to “ know only one
watchword—and that the progress of the greatest
nation of the earth—the British Empire.” No,
siree. Show that sentiment to the door, Jeames.
And the B.E. is not “the greatest nation of the
earth.” Why, it isn’t even “a nation.”
The unhappy N.S.W. Protectionist-party !
Here you have ex-leader G. Republican Dibbs
proposing success to the new Japanese line of
steamers, denouncing Jap-exclusion legislation,
and declaring that if any vote of his could ever be
the means of obtaining the little' brown man a
welcome to Australia it would enthusiastically be
given !
Another batch of two dozen Chows has

Whoop for the kink of that “People’s
Federal Convention ” that wanted it to express its
belief in a Supreme Being ! Corollary : Why not
also in Satan ? In sin ? In dirt ? In colic ?
See the simple vulgarity of its mathematics. If
there is a Last, there must be a twentieth, a nine-
teenth . . . a third, a second, a First! Every
fool knows that much. Let us here affirm our
belief in the flatness of the earth—that is, of its
people.
Trenwith, back in Melb., has an infinity of
matter bottled up, as cannot fail to be the case with
such a keen observer and digger-down. In par-
ticular, the blackness of English poverty, under
Freetrade, is his theme, infinitely surpassing any
conceptions he had formed about it. He says the
Democracy is a seething mass, led by so many con-
tradictory systems that united action seems im-
possible. This hampered him a good deal in public
speaking, and often prevented him speaking at all.
N.S.W. Parliament has closed up for six
months or so, and the Government dodged the
Federation question to the last. Kit is proposed
to wait for Queensland then there will be no pro-
gress for probably another year, possibly longer.
And as the Reid Ministry has flatly refused to say
whether it intends to wait for Queensland, or
when it will go on, or whether it has any definite
intention of going on under any circumstances
whatever, the problem is left in a most hazy state.
First three lines of a recent Sydney Tele-
graph article: “The recent heavy imports of
breadstutfs, combined with the high prices ruling
for wheat and flour under the reign of Freetrade,”
&c. The high prices of wheat and flour under
Freetrade seem to be advanced as a distinct cause
of congratulation. What about the Cheap Loaf
that was promised ? Also, the cheapness that was
to prevail generally, and the load that was to be
“removed from the back of the consumer,” and
all the rest ?
SOUND FINANCE.
MR. ROSENBLOOM (to his little son Ikey) : “ Ven counting money paid
over to you, mein son, nefer pick up de last note — it’s just
bossible dere may be another underneath.”
The case of ex-policeman Green was once
more dragged into Vie. Leg. Assembly last week.
Green has some ancient grievance based upon the
belief that the State is a miloh-cow for public
servants, and in his time he has petitioned far and
wide. Even V.R. didn’t escape his plaintive
wail. Chief-Secretary Peacock seems to have
extinguished the last spark of bogus sympathy for
the policeman by stating that he has drawn a
pension of =8222 from the Government for the last
eleven years. A lot of people would like to be
martyrs on the same terms.
For once the slumberous jealousy existing
between the North and South of Tasmania has
been productive of good. The Great Western
Railway grab now looks like getting through both
Houses, with modifications on the. basis of a 25
years’ lease with right of renewal and a royalty on
minerals raised. The North v. South banner was
hardly big enough to openly fight under, so the
Northern members—who wouldn’t particularly
object to their end of the island being gridironed
—battled back and edge against parting with the
fee-simple of the land reached for by the syndi-
cate. The result is the modified grab aforemen-
tioned.
Significant that the Tory Sydney D.T.
should thus editorialise : “There are interests to
be considered in the northern province (Q.) that
are incompatible with a federation that does not
make liberal concessions. ” Of course there are—
Kanakas. But Federal Australia (the Republic)
can make no concessions of any sort to a slave-
trade and the color question. No, not even at the
cost of ultimate civil war.
“BE SEATED, MADAM!"
Holder village settlement, named after the
S. A. Treasurer, is the first of the villages estab-
lished by the late Lands Minister Gillen to pay
its way. This year, owing to the high price of
cereals, the settlers have paid off all Govt, liabili-
ties and are left with a good balance: a severe
knock for the Ass papers, which prophesied dire
failure, but reckoned without Gillen, who stuck to
the villages through all their initiatory troubles,
and, unfortunately, died just when they began to
turn the corner.
Among N.S.W. Assembly Bills not pro-
ceeded with by the Council in the Session just
concluded are —
Law Practitioners.
Supreme Court Procedure Amendment.
Legal Profession Amalgamation.
Judges Relatives Disqualification.
There are so many lawyers and lawyers’ relatives
in the House of Kidney Fits that it seems hope-
less to expect reform pf Law or Lawyers until the
Council is either reformed or abolished.
“It is easy for Premier Kingston to be
brave on the law-reform path,’’ said a Q. visitor to
Sydney, the other day. “He has a naturally
sympathetic House to talk to on such topics, for
there are but three legal men in his Assembly
altogether. But, take us in Queensland. Why,
five out of our eight Cabinet Ministers are lawyers.
And take N.S.W. House. What sort of law-
reform pudding can you make with five lawyers in
the Cabinet, not to mention the fingers of unofficial
sharks ? Until a community stops sending
lawyers into Parliament, it has no right to expect
law-reform in any but homoeopathic doses.”
Which is true.
A leaky argument from the S.M. Herald :
And it is to be borne in mind that direct taxation in the
other provinces is in addition to the exactions of a Pro-
tectionist tariff, not, as in N.S. Wales, in substitution for
them.
Query : What are the exactions of a Protectionist
tariff ? Victoria for last quarter levied .£457,000
m customs duties ; N.S.W., £367,000. There is
a difference, certainly, but still the exactions of
Free-raid seem to keep up pretty close to those of
Protection. Also, if customs and excise are both
reckoned, the figures are .£580,000 and .£530,000,
and Foreign-trade is very near indeed to being as
exacting as the other thing.
For the purposes of Australian trade, the
natural deep-water port of Tasmania is Devon-
port, in the North, where the big potatoes come
from. The common-sense route for a railway
from the silver West Coast would terminate at
Devonport. Hobart, on the Derwent, is too far
south ; Launceston is 40 miles up a river where
vessels of ordinary draught get stuck on the mud-
banks ; Devonport is near the open sea, nearest to
Australian ports, the centre of a fine agricultural
district, and can float vessels of big tonnage with-
out disturbing the cockles. Hobart property-
owners dimly realise these facts, hence the frantic
haste to rush the Clarke-Hordern-Officer syndicate
proposals through Parliament.
The Tory party in Maoriland has almost
dropped out of sight as a factor in the coming
shindy. Many of the leading Tories have discon-
solately thrown up the game, and those that remain
orate in a depressed fashion to small audiences
who come to scoff and remain to bray, and, rightly
or wrongly, the Democrats have begun to leave
them almost wholly out of consideration. The
principal fight, it is now anticipated, will be
between the Government following and the great
Gold Tea party. This is probably the first time in
any country that the Cold Tea faction has loomed
so large that men are forced to consider the possi-
bility of a Gingerbeer Ministry arising within the
next few years, and to think hard over the possible
consequences thereof. The Gingerbeer Ministry
seems to be a good way off yet, but not by any
means so far off as it looked 10 years ago.
About the worst thing which happened to
the Bathurst Convention was the publication in
Sydney Telegraph of portraits of “prominent
members.” That well-meaning paper made them
a hard, murderous-looking lot, except in one or
two cases where it suddenly reduced them to mild,
beaming idiocy trimmed with a vacant stare and
long Dundreary whiskers. The portraits were
enough to wreck any movement.
SydneyTELEGRAPH’s
“ Horrors of Protection”
man grows more and
more mixed up as he
goes along. He asserts,
first, that the country
with the largest marriage-
rate is the most pros-
perous; second, that the
Victorian marriage -rate
has declined because of
Protection; third, he
publishes a table for the
ten years 1883-1892 show-
ing that in that period
the marriage-rate in Vic-
toria declined ‘8 per
1000 and in N.S.W. it
declined 2'04 per 1000, or
nearly three times as
much. Fourthly, he
adds up his table, and
shows that the average
rate for ten years in Vic-
toria is 7'78 marriages
per 1000 inhabitants and
in N.S.W. 7'71 per 1000,
so that the Free-raid
province is actually be-
hind. Then, fifthly, he
remarks again that the
lamentable state of the
Vic. marriage-rate is an
awful proof of the Hor-
rors of Protection.
N. S. W. A gent-
General Samuel begins to
kick against the globe-
trotting politician—gen-
erally one of the mental
deadbeats of Parliament
—who drifts casually to
London and advertises
himself as a Commis-
sioner coine on some
State errand or other.
Recently Sammy Lees
dropped in and advertised
himself as having a State
mission toadvertise hard-
woods for paving purposes ; Poet Neild—the
Nocent Waterspout person—caine along with-
some poems and stated that he was a Com-
missioner collecting facts about Old Age Pen-
sions ; and Prank Parnell arrived and gave notice
that Australia was going to secede from the H’em-
pire. Saul naturally wants to know why he is
sent to London to attend to N.S.W. business if
Lees and Parnell and the Nocent Waterspout are
to come along in this casual fashion and do it for
him.
Queensland has suddenly announced a
special postage rate on newspapers from outside
the province. The average outside daily paper
will now pay Id. instead of |d., and the average-
sized weekly such as The Bulletin will be
charged Qd. A specially large edition such as
the Xmas number will pay something like 2§d. in
postage. Judging from the date of this new
announcement it is apparently the answer of the
great Boodle Government to sundry unpleasant
things that have been said down South re the
dreadful Q.N. Bank, and the politicians who ran
that putrid institution. If the Government’s
object is not to shut out the papers which insist
on telling the beastly truth about its bank and
its niggers, it should have arranged the new de-
parture for some date when the coincidence
wouldn’t be quite so smellful.
Ex-Mayor Langford, North Melbourne,
President of the Shirk of Romset,
tells you Warners’ Safe Cure will make you well
and strong. Everybody knows Robert Langford,
Esq., and when he tells people everywhere to take
Warners’ Safe Cure for liver trouble, all know
that he means just what he says.
( Melbourne, Sept. 18, 1896.
“ About seven or eight years ago I was suffering
with severe pains in my right side and under the
shoulder-blades ; also flatulency and indigestion.
My urine was very much discolored and contained
a thick sediment. This naturally unfitted me for
my business, and with loss of sleep and no appetite
I thought my time had come. I had some of the
best medicai men attending me, who prescribed
all sorts of medicine without doing me any good,
sol decided to give them up and try Warners’
Safe Cure, which had not only been recommended
me by several friends, who had derived great
benefits from it, but I had read one of their pam-
phlets of cases similar to mine being cured by it,
and testimonials from well-known citizens whom 1
knew. I quickly decided to try it, and con-
sequently sent for three bottles and some of the
pills. When I took the first bottle, I did not feel
a bit better ; in fact, I thought I was worse, but,
as one bottle does not always have the effect, I
persevered with it, and when I had got through
the fourth bottle, the improvement was so marked
that I still kept at it; and when I had taken
about fourteen bottles, I was so well and strong
that I found I had no necessity to take any more,
as I really felt a new man, and fit for business,
with more energy than I had before. I have
much confidence in recommending Warner’s Safe
Cure to anyone who suffers with liver complaint. ”


The Sunlight Year-Book for 1897, which
Alex. Lindsay, bookseller, of Pitt-st., Sydney, sup-
plies bound in cloth for—6d. ! (post-free lOd.) con-
tains probably more solid information than was ever
given for sixpence before. It is like Whitaker’s
Almanac, only more so ; puts all the statistics of
the British Empire at your fingers’ ends, and
supplements them with notes on sport and litera-
ture, celebrated people, household hints, a com-
pendium of games, and similar matter which must
be seen to be appreciated. In fact, the book is a
regular sixpenny bonanza.*
Mr. Arthur Griffith wishes to notify intend-
ing patentees that he has commenced practice as a
Patents and Trade Marks Agent at 39 Castlereagh-
street, Sydney. He has entered into arrange-
ments with leading agents in Europe, America,
Australasia, and South Africa, so that inventors
may rely upon having their interests protected.
Mr. Griffith’s charges will, in all cases, be so
moderate as to place a patent within the reach of
the poorest inventor. For £2O, exclusive of the
cost of plans, Mr. Griffith will obtain Provisional
Protection for any invention in the seven Austra-
lasian colonies and Great Britain.*
G. Robertson and Co., the well-known

The progressive firm of Gowing Bros.,
486, 488 and 490 George-street, Sydney, has re-
cently purchased the whole contents of a large
Sydney clothing warehouse, and now offers this
£30,000 worth of fine stock at a big reduction.
People are advised to go to Gowing Bros, at once
if not sooner, because, although there are suits
enough on hand to clothe thousands of
people, the longer intending customers wait the
fewer there will be to choose from. Gowing Bros,
is an old-established firm which has always stood
high in public credit.*

A well-known Melbourne actor, who always wears a wig,

crown of his head, while the formerly unvegetated patch
will be carpeted with a rich thicket of down ; in another
week the desert will be found on his right temple, or at
the top of his spine, or in the middle of his parting. He
goes to bed at night speculating as to where he’ll be bald
next morning. Melb. pros, who know of this freak actu-
jdl.y gamble and get up sweeps on the race, dividing his

A female detective has turned up in a
deep-blue Melb. divorce-case. She was young
and neat, with an air of innocence and a dove-
like expression. She followed respondent to a bad
house, and took observations, and placidly related
what she saw to an astounded court, maintaining
all the time the blushless composure of a smooth-
haired Sundayrschool teacher reading Jeremiah
to an infant class. The Judge was horrified, and
advised the young woman to forsake the calling of
private detective right away, and she regarded
him with a baby stare the while, and looked so
like a densely innocent Quakeress escaped from
parental control that half the men in court wanted
to be a big brother to her on the spot, and would
have made the offer probably, but for a vague
suspicion that she was winking inwardly.
Last week, a young lady named Murray,
resident at Thorpe’s Pinch, Mudgee, N.S.W., met
her death through being dashed against a tree by
a horse which had already killed two people.
FEEDORATION AT BATHIRST.
The fell tornado swept upon the City of the Dead
and Gone,
The wind of all the continent on that devoted city
spent,
Toy trumpets blared, the press was squared, tin
godlets all the glory shared,
And, while each penny whistle piped, the local
wags hoorayed and swiped,
Oh ! such a fake ! The earth did shake till every-
one was made awake,
And all the world was told again—“ There is a
City of the Plain ! ”
(In spite of all the blizzard’s whizz, we don’t
believe there was or is. )
For once “ the ghost was made to walk,” by talk—
talk—talk ! —Dipso.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Merman, bought from W. R. Wilson by the
dealer who captured Maluma, will be considered the
handsomest Australian horse they have seen on an English
racecourse—always presuming that he gets there. Ring-
master, Paris, and Maluma ranked as little ones, but
Merman is a full-sized dandy, with a showy chestnut coat
and plenty of “ jam ”in his style. On his latest perform-
ance he is every bit as good as his looks. The habit of
running “stiff” in private gave the stable no encourage-
ment to do what might have been done with Merman,
and after the Williamstown Cup race Mr. Wilson let the
animal go on the assumption that his “ form ” was now
fully exposed.

Plag. : “ Quick and Dead, best racing-heading,
Champion’s copyright.” No. Melb. Boomerano (de-
ceased) first used it. It was invented by a well-known
Bulletin writer (“ M‘G.”) on the inspired night when he
prophesied that Flemington would be laid down as a
cycle-track and Melb. Cup run on pneumatic tyres.

“A. W. Steel,” the turf-adviser who has gone
'Ome and left many clients lamenting, used to hobnob of
yore with Hopetoun on the hunting-field. His Excellency
was impressed by the up-to-date Hinglish cut of Steel’s
sporting garments, which were the “ correct thing,” he
said. Unfortunately, the tailor didn’t make the man.

The Melb. tipster who has to fulfil his promise
of eating Newhaven, with sage and onions, took bis cue
from the English Bell’s Life, or one of its rivals: “If
George Frederick wins this Grand National event, I’ll eat
the ugly brute, hoofs and all.” George Frederick won.
Dreadnaught (Chester—Trafalgar), one of the
heroes of the season ’B9-’9l), is making his mark as a sire
in Maoriland, four out of five of his offspring now racing
having been already returned winners this season. A son
of his (Defiance) recently ran second in Wanganui Derby,
and is thought to have a fair chance of annexing N.Z.
Cup, in which he carries 7st. lib.

Cantle : “ English jockeys are superior to Aus-
tralians because more under the whip. They are fewer in
proportion, form a healthy corporation, and, riding nearly
every day at one place or another, are kept pretty free
from razzle-dazzle and bribery.”

Not one in a hundred of Tire’s backers are

S.S. ; “The Bulletin is quite excited in its
defence of the V.R.C. against the rabid democracy that
infests the fiat at Flemington on race-days, and is always
wanting more. But really, is the V.R.C. the benevolent
institution it is represented to be? Is it continually
bestowing favors on the ungrateful flatite for which it re-
ceives and expects no return ? As a matter of fact the
club draws a very decent revenue from the flat on big
days ; the intake from vehicles, from booths, bookies and
various machines and contrivances for entertaining and
impoverishing the crowd is a considerable item in its in-
come, large enough to justify the demands made for in-
creased accommodation on the lower level. Besides, the
flat provides a pretty considerable proportion of the
revenue the V.R.C. derives from the sale of railway-
tickets to the course, and also helps to pay for the privi-
lege of free rail-riding which club members enjoy, and
which is worth just £2500 a year. The V.R.C. may be
trusted to watch its own pocket.”

A Melb. cyclist, who left his bike in a railway
cloakroom the other day, neatly bowled out the clerk-in-
charge. “Somebody’s been riding this bicycle,” he
remarked, on calling back for it. “ No, sir,” declared the
clerk, boldly, “it hasn’t left the office.” “Then,” said
the cyclist, “how do you account for that cyclometer
registering seven miles more than when the bike was left
here ? ” Then the railway-man confessed.

The entries for the Austral Wheel Race for 1896
numbered 178, of which 126 accepted. As entrance and
acceptance are each £l, the Melb. bicycle club collars
£3o4—from the competitors to whom it allots £3so—in
prizes. So practically the much-boomed generosity of
the club named amounts to exactly £46.

Parsons showed his best form yet at St. Kilda
meeting last Saturday. In the International Mile, he won
his heat by a street from Pither, who looked a certainty
until Parsons went out and shot past the field : the final
he won just as easily by a couple of lengths from Boidi,
the Italian, who made his Melb. d6but.
Some of the foreign contingent seemed to be
thoroughly imbued with a spirit of Communism. One
swarthy cyclist, whose own machine had temporarily gone
bung, coolly removed the wheel from Gargurevich’s
machine and pedalled along the track, leaving the diminu-
tive owner to race with half a jigger. What a mercy for
the Italian that it wasn’t Bilmartin’s bike !
Kellow, winner of the =£loo-Brassey Stakes last
New Year’s Day, and a double at Goulburn recently, added
£5O to his banking-account by annexing the St. Kilda
Wheel Race. The gaunt Kellow, who is the local Red
Bird agent, has really struck form for the first time for
years, and should be one of the most dangerous men of the
season.
Second to Kellow ran young MTnnes, the South
Melb. boy who should have won the last tw'o Australs on
track form. MTnnes has always performed execrably in
a race, and though only 17 now has put in the last three
seasons training hard. With less cycling, the lad would
have been a better cyclist.
Basil Crisp, last year’s Austral winner, won’t
do much this season judging b.y Saturday’s form. The
Hobart man is good enough in a long distance race, but
seems utterly lost when sprinting. Last Austral fell to
him so easily that Crisp had no cause to sprint in the last
lap.
Very disappointing also were the Italian con-
tingent. Boidi, the alleged champion of Italy, on scratch,
with Parsons in the Austral, is, on Saturday’s form, im-
measurably inferior to Porta, and who would think of
classing the latter with Parsons and Ken Lewis? Less
impressive than Boidi again is Cardano—apparently only
a second-rater, and not in the same street with the top 20>
of Australia’s cracks.
Surely it is about time that the public learned
to estimate the advts. of cycling-meetings at their proper
worth. The St. Kilda show last Saturday largely billed
M'Donell, Ralph and Ken Lewis as competitors, vet none
of those named competed. Somebody who has paid his
shilling to see the advertised men ought to initiate an
action for false pretences, or something of that sort, and
bust up the practice.
One of the most interesting points of a recent
big cycling meeting was when a well-known rider retired
from the five-mile race to a spot right in front of the
ladies’ reserve, where his sweater was raised and his bare
stomach energetically rubbed by his trainer.

A Sydney bankruptcy application has revived
memories of the Lord Sheffield team of cricketers, inas-
much as the item the “Earl of Sheffield, £lll Os. 1d.,”
appears amongst the judgment debts. Said the bank-
rupt, under examination : “The English cricketers came
to Penrith with a large following, to which were added
the Penrith district cricketers. They drank nearly every
drop of champagne and liquor I had in my hotel, and
never paid me a penn3' for it.” A statement of accounts
included the items :—“ Refreshments, including cham-
pagne, for English and Penrith cricketers and friends, £l4
10s. ; refreshment for 25 Penrith cricketers, including
scorers and umpires, £l2 10s.” No champagne for com-
mon Penrith cricketers!

Premier Kingston’s Colored Immigrants Bill,
now before S.A. Legislature, excludes natives of India,
amongst others, from entering S.A. Which means that
Ranjitsinjhi, if he comes out with Stoddart’s team, will
have to be exempted by proclamation. Kingston says if
Ranjy gets going against the S.A. bowlers he will prose-
cute him with the utmost rigor of the law.

Stanbury: “Fit and well, I can beat Gaudaur.
Australian scullers row a long stroke with plenty of back-
work, though I myself row with a straight back. Gaudaur
rows with a very short stroke extremely quickly; his
sculls, when he reaches out, are very little beyond his
’rigger, and his finish is hard with a screw in one shoulder.
He thinks that his stroke means more pace and less ex-
haustion than the long stroke does.”
• * * •
Harding, according to Stanbury, is a sculling
wonder in the same degree that Michael is a cycling
marvel; a small man but perfect in his work.

The game called “ African dodger” is becoming
common at races in the North. It is run mostly by
colored gentlemen. A black human head is stuck
through a sheet of canvas, and the public stands off and
shies eggs at it —three for a shilling, with half-a-crown to
receive for a hit. Occasionally the head is hit, but, as a
rule, the proprietor keeps well ahead of the game.
Dodging a fiver’s worth of eggs per diem should make a
man uncommon spry—and should be admirable practice
for budding politicians.
“African dodger ’’ is a game which must require
a lot of nerve and generalship. The natural tendency
would be for the dodger to shut his eyes when he thought
the missile was coming, so as not to get them full of egg,
and bob his head convulsively. With a view to the half-
crown, however, it is necessary to keep both eyes open,
and fixed on the approaching bird-fruit till the' very last
moment, and then, if it is obvious that the egg must hit,
it is time to close them and resignedly present the hardest
part of the cranium to the shock.' There ought to be
money in “African dodger,” provided a fast bowler
doesn’t get on the job with the eggs, and permanently
bowl out the African ; and there are social possibilities in
it. Supposing the dodger makes a pile and retires on it,
and his beautiful daughter marries a British earl, and
then, at the wedding breakfast, someone recognises the
head that he saw years ago dodging eggs at Is. each, and
mentions the fact, and then the bride falls insensible
under the table, and everybody says “ Damn,” and the
old man gets mad and fatally butts his enemy with a head
that has been hardened by much egg-concussion, and—
well, almost anything might happen to an African dodger
under such circumstances.

Edward Walker, the crack Vic. rifle-shot, is 45
years old, an Englishman by birth, and an engineer by
trade. He is a civilian now but a member of the Melb.
rifle club, and his world’s record score, with which he
carried off the Queen’s prize, consisted of 46 pts. at 500vds.,
63 at 600, 45 at 800, and 42 at 900. In the final stage (800
and 900yds.) Walker took 11 bulls-eyes out of 20 shots.

Old lawyer Snowden, M.L.C., announced
himself strongly against the proposal to let police-
officers conduct prosecutions in the inferior Vic
courts, instead of compelling the employment of a
lawyer. He was against it on purely public
grounds. A “glib policeman,” said Snowden,
might keep a small case going all day, merely
for purposes of self-ad vt., and the waste of time
would be awful. Then someone replied that the
other alternative was to hire a glib lawyer, who
was still more likely to keep a small case going all
day for advertising purposes, because he had to
live on ad vt., while the policeman had a regular
salary. And dull old Snowden was quite astonfshed
at this view of the case, which had never struck
him.

LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA.
A DISEASE LONG HELD BY
PHYSICIANS TO BE INCURABLE.
ITS HORRORS ARE THOSE OF A LIV-
ING DEATH—THE VICTIM HELP-
LESS, HIS TORTURE INTENSE—
AND IS A SOURCE OF CONSTANT
WORRY TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS—
A REMEDY FOR THE DISEASE
DISCOVERED.
Mr. James M‘Lean, a resident of Lefroy, Sim-
coe County, Out., is known to every man, woman
and child for miles around the vicinity of his home,
and all know of the long years during which his
condition has been that of a living death. Mr.
M'Lean tells of his injury, his years of torture,
and his subsequent release from the agonies of
locomotor ataxia, in the following vivid language :
“ In the year 1880 I was thrown from a scaffold,
falling on my back on a stone pile. I was badly
hurt, and narrowly escaped death. Plasters and
linaments were applied and I seemed to get some-
what better. But the apparent improvement was
short lived. My feet began to get unusually cold,
and nothing that could be done would warm them.
The trouble then spread to my legs, and from the
waist down I was attacked with shooting pains
flying along the nerves in thousands, and causing
the most terrible torture for days and nights at a
time. I could get no relief save from the injec-
tions of morphine. Six physicians treated me at
different times, but appeared only to faintly under-
stand my trouble, and could do nothing for my
relief. Some of the doctors declared my trouble
was rheumatism, but two of them said it was a
disease of the spinal cord, that there was no cure
for me, that the trouble would get worse, and that
sooner or later my arms would become affected.
This prediction proved true. My left hand
dropped at the wrist joint and hung dead and cold,
and I had no more control of it than if the hand
were not on me. Fly blisters and electricity were
resorted to without avail. My stomach was next
attacked with a burning, aching, nauseating pain,
causing the most distressing vomiting, and I often
thought I would not see morning. I have vomited
almost continually for thirty-six hours, and no-
thing but morphine or chloroform could deaden
the anguish I suffered. But worse trouble was in
store for me. I lost control of my bowels and
water, and my condition became most horrible,
necessitating constantly the greatest care and
watchfulness. I was now suffering from the top
of my head to the point of my toes. I saw double,
and had to keep my eyes fixed steadily on the
ground, to make a step at all, and the moment I
raised my eyes I would stagger and fall if I were
not grasping something. I could not take a single
step in the dark. For nine long years I suffered
all the horrors of a living death. In 1889 I was
admitted to the Toronto General Hospital, where
I was treated for four months. I was told that my
trouble was locomotor ataxia, and incurable, and
I returned home no better. After returning home
I had further medical treatment, but with no
better result than before. Finally I was given the
following certificate of incurability :
Churchill, July 27th, 1893.
THIS IS TO CERTIFY that James M'Lean
has a disease of the spinal cord (incurable) that
renders him unfit to obtain a living.
A. T. LITTLE, M.D.
About this time I was strongly urged to try Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, and, oh, how I wish I had
known of this great remedy years ago ! What
anguish and torture I would have been spared !
Soon after beginning the use of Pink Pills I found
myself improving. The pains left me and I was
able to discontinue the use of morphine. I re-
gained control of both bowels and bladder, and
gradually a feeling of life returned to my legs and
arms. I can now walk without the aid of either
crutches or sticks, and can take long strides. My
stomach trouble has all left me, and I can eat as
heartily as ever in my life. My friends, who
never expected to see me about again, are aston-
ished at the wonder Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have
wrought in me. When I began the use of the pills
my weight was reduced to 1351 b. and it has now
increased to 1651 b. lam a new man, and it is
not posssible for me to say enough in praise of
your marvellous medicine. My wife also joins
with me in thanks, and says it was a happy day
for her when I began the use of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, as, since then she has been able to get
rest at night, which she had not done for so many
long years before. I hope Heaven will direct this
into the hands of some other poor sufferer, who
may find, as I did, release from a living death
through your great life-saving remedy.
Yours very gratefully*
JAMES M'LEAN.

The night of Melbourne Cup a Bulletin
man ran against a garrulous stranger in a tram-
car. He was so full of goodwill that he had to
talk to someone : he simply boiled over with joy
and conversation and kindly feeling towards the
whole human race. He had backed Newhaven, it
seemed ; and he poured forth all particulars how
he came to do it, and gave the pedigree of the
horse, and briefly reviewed the winners of past
Melbourne Cups, and then branched off into a
long dissertation on horse in general. He was
simply overflowing with horse ; he perspired
horse; there was horse streaming down him; in
fact, he had got horse worse than any other man
The Bulletin scribe ever met. “And did you
back Newhaven ? ” he asked at the end of twenty-
five minutes continuous horse. “No, didn’t back
anything for the Cup.” He looked unaffectedly
sorry at this ; he was so boiling over with joy him-
self that ho wanted all the world to whoop along
with him. Then he brightened up. “Perhaps
you’ve got a horse going for you in some other
£ a ’ he said. The pressman intimated that he
hadn t anything on any horse : the only sporting
event he had on was a small sum on M‘Kinley
against Bryan. Then the affable Australian looked
§• i, alI (t ov ® r - “You’re all right,” he said cor-
he s a good horse.. That blanky horse is
Then he got out, his last words being that
that horse was good enough for anything. Ap-
parently he had never heard of monometallism or
bimetallism or Republicans or Democrats or mug-
wumps or the Tammany vote ; they had all raged
past him unnoticed. His simple little world was
all horse.
The difference between a man “sowing his
wild oats” and another who has sown them. One
is as bad as he can be, the other is only as bad as
he can afford to be. —Proverbs of Solomon; revised

But few of noted specialists have sprung into pre
eminence and an immense practice as Surgeon Langston,
a resident and practitioner at 121 Collins-street, Mel-
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has performed in are acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life ; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, andean treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aentng
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power and
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year of 18711 was eight day*
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone

r ACTION ON THE HEART.— Professor Heckel states that Kola, by the
Caffeine and Theobromine which it contains, is a tonic of the heart, whose pulsations
it accelerates, while it increases its power and regulates its contractions. Professor
Heckel further points out that the principle called Kolaine contained in Kola pre-
vents rapid waste of the tissues during fatiguing exertions, whilst the Caffeine
stimulates the muscles.
PNEUMONIA- Worry kills business men. Heavy losses and hard times
ma ~e t lem depressed in spirits. The brain and body become weak : unknown to
em ey are debilitated. It is then that the least chill strikes them, and pneu-
monia carries them off. To fortify the system and make the spirits buoyant, nothing
can equal Fisher and Co.’s famous Kola Hut Tonic. It is the most remarkable in-
vigorator and sustainer known.

M ‘Arthur, M.P., whose modest visit to
Australia has just terminated, holds the post of
junior Whip of the Liberal-party in the British
Commons.
Rev. Percival, after a long residence in
Albury, declares that town to be among the most
immoral in Australia. No doubt an insidious
way of commending Albury as a seat for the
Federal Parliament.
Fashionable hotels at ’Ome now have their
menus made up in the form of daily journals, con-
taining a number of dramatic, sporting, and gos-
sipy society paragraphs. Not a bad idea incases
where the English waiters are as slow as Aus-
tralian ones..
Dear Bulletin, —I have often heard that
snakes have a great aversion to tomato-plants, and
that people living where snakes are numerous have
planted a ring of tomato-plants round their houses
and have never been troubled by snakes at bed or
board. Is the tomato the real antidote to snake-
bite ’— Gilhooley.

When Coroner Youl’s father was chaplain
in Tasmania in the twenties, one of his experiences
was the marrying of 30 couples with the one wed-
ding-ring. Some of the candidates brought two
jor three of their children to be baptised. Most of
the batch had be-n legally married by magistrates
years before the' Rev. John arrived, but the
solemnisation of the contract is dear to the hearts
of women l —and parsons.
In Paris there is a house into which
patients are-received to undergo imaginary opera-
tions. Society touts are employed at good salaries
to persuade hypochondriacs and “interesting
invalids ” that they really are suffering from some
organic complaint which can only be cured by the
knife. They go into “hospital,” are chloroformed,
a few superficial cuts and scratches are inflicted,
and they are discharged with many high en-
comiums as to wondrous endurance, and remark-
able constitution, and the rest of it. The big fees
are paid in advance, and the business is immensely
lucrative.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Another Tichborne yarn sent along to The
Bulletin identifies the real Sir Roger with one
Ramsden, who enlisted in a regiment of Grenadiers,
stationed at Melbourne, when they were summoned
to active service in India. Ramsden, says the
yarn, confided the secret of his Tichborne per-
sonality to a brother private named Moffat, after
which he died fighting for the Queen, and therefore
wasn’t able to return ’Ome and claim his estates.
Moffat forgot all about the defunct Ramsden—
Roger Tichborne—for many years, but eventually
recalled the matter to mind whilst confined in
Wakefield Gaol, and furnished the governor of
that calm retreat with full particulars. Two other
ex-members of the regiment seem to have come
forward and testified that a man known as Rams-
den did get killed, as described by Moffat. The
yarn ends here, and it isn’t a very convincing con-
tribution to the book of Tichborne romance. It
reminds one of Jean Luie, whose famous story (of
how he once met the real Sir Roger aboard the
ship Osprey) seemed so genuine that the Tich-
borne trial was adjourned to permit of enquiries
into the witness’s character. Result a stiff perjury
sentence for Luie on the ground that he had been
“doing time ” at the period of his alleged encoun-
ter with Roger. It was during a latter “time,”
maybe, that Luie manufactured his first-class fic-
tion. In prison a man gets such splendid oppor-
tunities for brain work.

Health and Strength
RESTORED
BY THE USE OF
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mrs. M. A. Cumming, of Yarraville,
Victoria, Australia, Says:
“About a year ago, I had a severe
attack of Influenza, which left me
very weak, without energy, appe-
tite, or interest in life. Obtaining
little or no. relief from doctors, or
from the many remedies recom-
mended to me, I finally tried Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and from that time,
began to gain health and strength,
I continued the treatment until
fully recovered, and now have very
great pleasure in telling my friends
of the merits of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
and the happy results of its use. I
consider it the best blood-purifier
known.”

“ Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none

He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and

A learned Australian LL.D. recently had
the dreary path of law brightened somewhat by
two girls. They called on him in an irregular
fashion about dusk, and explained blushfully that
one of them was about to get married and wanted
to consult him. “By all means,” said the learned
one; “such cases often come before me. Pray
sit down.” They sat down, and then the younger
and more dazzling of the two removed her boot
and stocking so suddenly that the LL.D. hadn’t
time to protest, even if he had desired to do so,
which he isn’t quite sure that he did, and laid an
unexpected foot before him, explaining that she
had been bitten at one time by a bull-ant or some-
thing which had left a mark, and she wanted the
blemish removed before marriage. The LL.D.
concealed his emotion by examining the foot
closely. “ I think, ”he said at last, “that this is
a case in which legal proceedings would be useless.
You had better consult a medical man.” “But
you’re a medical man, aren’t you ? ” “ No, I’m a
doctor of laws.” Then a scared beauty dispersed
hurriedly out of the front door, and how she got
into her cab she never really knew.
The Eye-sight measure sent per post by
the inventors, Messrs. Greenfield and Barraclough,
the well-known opticians of George-st., Sydney,
is a wonderful little contrivance which will enable
eye-sufferers in the country to ascertain the data
necessary for obtaining proper spectacles. The
subtler forms of sight-defect cannot, of course, be
measured by. the instrument, but it is thoroughly
effective for the more usual forms of eye affection
such as long sight, short sight, old sight. Full
particulars from Messrs. Greenfield and Barra- ‘
dough. #
Dr. de Lautour, of Omaru, M.L., well illus-
trates in a late paper the need of minute obser-
vation in police cases. In connection with a case
of cut throat, there was found a razor having
certain blood-smears on handle and blade, which
suggested the grain of the skin of fingers and
thumb. Dr. de Lautour proved experimentally
that fingers wet with fresh blood could not make
such smears, but that such could only be made by
a hand stained with blood that had begun to dot.
The indication, therefore, was that the smears had
been made, not by the freshly-spirted hand of a
suicide, but by the partially-dried hand of another
person, and murder became the natural conclusion.
Again, in a case of burglary witli violence, there
was noticed on a sheet of white blotting-paper the
dusty impression of a naked foot. This was fixed
by gum, and then photographed. Three men,
' arrested on suspicion, were made to walk bare-
footed along a corridor, first over a coating of
printer’s ink, then over white paper. Excellent
prints of the sole-grainings were got, and the
criminal was thus identified by himself. Other
cases have been recorded in which, through a' pis-
tol being held in the riijht hand of a Ze/Lhanded
person, the attempt to hide murder by hinting
suicide failed. Again, apparent suicides by shoot-
ing or apparent deaths by gun accidents have been
proved to be cases of murder by keen-witted doc-
tors showing that the track of the shot was quite
inconsistent with the supposition of either suicide
or accident, e.g., the Landells case in Lilydale
district, Vic, which was ingeniously shown by
Melb. ITfiiv. Professor Allen to be murder owing
to peculiarities in the track of the missile.

Business, Robbery, etc.
In 1853 Melbourne was an uncivilised assem-
blage of houses, with no roads, drains, or gas, until a
Signor Gabrielli came along. This gentleman, without a
penny of his own, contrived to finance matters so well as
to lend Melbourne corporation £500,000, and Geelong
£200,000, in all £700,000, secured by Govt, guarantee.
The sum was lent at a discount of 5 per cent, (every £95
counting as £100) and charged for at 6 per cent. The
Signor moreover sold his scrip, at a premium of three per
cent., to the very men who ought to have done it for
themselves and reaped the profit. He cleared over
£50,000 by the transaction without investing a cent, of his
own, and at last accounts was still living in gilded splen-
dour somewhere in the south of Italy. The best of the
joke is that the unsophicated borrowers, in gratitude,
gave him a farewell banquet, and ever after referred to
him as their “public benefactor.” They are not built
that way now down South.
• * • *
The secrecy re amounts paid into the income-tax
fund down South has quickly been dissipated. One
official, for disclosing secrets, has been shunted ; but is he
the only one guilty? Southern T.P. societies are credited
with being up-to-date, and what more natural than that
some poor devil who, in need of an extra couple of pounds
a week, can easily earn the amount without any exertion
worth mentioning, should embrace the opportunity.
After the recent postal disclosures in Victoria, anything
seems possible in that province’s officialdom.

Wild-cats of various kinds, but some of Wes-
tralia’s in particular, have incited the French Government
to pass a new company law of a self-protecting kind.
This law ordains that henceforward, before any company

a responsible agent must be appointed in France and be
accepted as such by the Minister of Finance or his repre-
sentative. Hitherto the French public were content to
invest in their local Rentes and the Government loans of
neighboring Powers, but during the last few years, and
especially in the early part of 1896, such multitudes of
mining schemes have been engineered from Australia and
elsewhere to London, and thence to Paris, that the Go-
vernment of Jacques Crapaud demands this guarantee of
good faith.

Bromley the other day treated Yic Assembly to a
few instances of local commercial morality. Said
Bromley : “He had known a firm holding one of the
highest positions in the city to import fire-proof safes,
not painted or ornamented, and afterwards paint them,
and put fictitious names on them, and sell them to the
public for four or five times their oost. He had known
pianofortes worth £7 10s. or £8 to be imported to Mel-
bourne, and after arrival brass plates with fictitious
names had been screwed on them, and they had been sold
for £25 or £3O each.” What might Bromley not have said
re the fictitious labelling of whiskies, gins, &c., imported,
or Victorian !

Bananaland boasts 22 breweries, and turned out
last year 5,000,000 gallons of beer. Consumption of im-
ported beer is declining, while the consumption of Aus-
tralian wines is increasing. Queensland alone last year
produced over 250,000 gallons of native wine. The
Northern aspect of the drink question is decidedly im-
proving.

One bitter humorist distinguished himself on
Hospital Sunday in Melbourne. He put into the plate
about £3OO of the paper of a hopelessly dead bank which
the principal shining light of the church had run in the
boom days. When the collection was counted and the
documents rose up in evidence, the various lights, most
of whom had run banks in their time, made no remark,
but their expression signified that they regarded that
depositor as Lost.
Somebody forwards The Bulletin a copy of a
Sydney publication called the Rescue, which is apparently
carried free by post at N.S.W. taxpayers’ expense. En-
closed is a collecting-form for several charitable societies.
Rescue consists of 16 pages, of which about six con-
tain advts. The remainder are chiefly made up of appeals
to friends and children and the general public to forward
cash and other things to G. E. Ardill, Director, Sydney
Rescue Work Society. Mr. Ardill’s name occurs some two
dozen times throughout the paper; and as he has been
soliciting contributions from the public for a good num-
ber of years now, The Bulletin is curious to know
whether' he is a philanthropist of independent means, or
whether he is paid for his services, and, if so, how much ?
Therefore, this paper, which doesn’t remember to have
seen any duly-audited balance-sheets of the Home of
Hope, or the Babies’ Homes, or the All-Night Refuge, or
the Cruelty to Children society, or any of the other
Ardill societies, for some time past, will be glad if Mr.
Ardill, or Mr. C. E. Wigzell, or Mr. E. Vickery, M.L.C.,
or any of the others concerned, will send along the last
balance-sheet of each society to this office for perusal.

In Sydney Bankruptcy Court. A publican,
asked if he’d kept a book of accounts (as required by the
Act), replied, after deliberation, that he hadn’t. Subse-
quently he stated that he had, but as it disclosed Sunday
trading he had thought the matter over and, deciding
that he’d come off lighter if he committed a breach of
the Bankruptcy Act than if he broke the Licensing Act, he
burnt the book. Another man said that he owed a female
relative a large sum of money, but she had promised to
liquidate it if he would give her the custody and control
of his child, of which she was very fond. So he had
handed the child over and wiped the debt out.

The facts re the West Bogan (N.S.W.) scrub-
clearing works—concerning which there has been much
pother in print and in Labor-led deputations—are these :
The men get so much (variable) for work done ; the
amounts they are alleg'ed to earn are set down in official
statistics and quoted by' the Minister whenever he is
called on to talk in reply to anything ; those amounts are
correct, as such ; but there are such grave deductions for
rations, miscellaneous charges, and a something called
“discount” on moneys advanced for engagement, fares
up, &0., that the sum (cash) actually received by the poor
devils is not enough to play pitch-penny with, let alone
to send anything to their wives and families. “Figures
can’t lie?” Pardon this paper : Figures nearly always
beat even a snake-and-bible liar.

Maoriland shipowners discharge a cordial and
well-deserved curse at their country’s shipping regula-
tions. The local vessel is strictly supervised by law ; it
must comply with a certain fixed standard of seaworthi-
ness and carry a certain complement of men ; must not
have its load-line submerged, and is prohibited from
carrying deck-cargo. But the Government never had the
courage to extend these regulations to foreign vessels,
therefore the casual ship from Honolulu or ’Murka, when
she discharges her cargo at one port, will do a little
coasting business, or a great deal of it, under very advan-
tageous circumstances, before she loads up again for
foreign parts. She can carry twice as much cargo as the
local craft is allowed to take, have her decks loaded to
almost any extent, bury her 1 lad-line about as deep as she
pleases, and go from port to port with as few sailors as her
captain likes to carry. Therefore she can cut freights far
below the figure that will pay the Maoriland shipowner
and still make a profit. In the United States, this diffi-
culty is settled in one act by a law which says that no
foreign vessel whatever shall go into the coasting busi-
ness. Either the same law should be adopted in Austral-
asia, or, at the very least, the foreign vessels should not
be allowed to carry one ounce of freight from one Austral-
asian port to another unless under the same regulations
which apply to the locally-owned vessel. Protecting the
foreigner against the local man is a curiously upside-down
policy.
N.S.W. Patents Law Amendment.
A capable correspondent writes :
Re Want’s Patents Bill and your references thereto —
one way or the other, the only questions really at issue
are whether the principle involved is just and whether its
application is expedient. The fact that at any moment
particular persons happen to be obviously interested is
not ail argument. The second part of the Bill—that
relating to revocations-is mere padding. Only one re-
vocation case has ever been heard in N.S.W. : that was a
purely formal proceeding in which one person owned two
patents, and required to annihilate one so that the other
would stand clear.
The circumstances of N.S.W. are such that argument
based on the practice of other countries in connection
with amendment of patents, is not final. England,
with almost every other country, has, for all modern time,
had incorporated in its law provisions permitting amend-
ment on terms practically identical with those of Want’s
Bill; but N.S.W. law never contained such a provision.
In those other countries, therefore, the position of the
public is this : so long as a patent is not so utterly out of
form as to be incapable of amendment it must be re-
spected, for even though in its original shape it may be
void and ineffectual, yet if amended within permissible
limits it will become valid and effectual; so only that por-
tion which the patentee has wrongfully claimed may be
used by the public without fear of interference from him.
In N.S.W., however, a patent bad in part is bad totally,
and cannot be rectified ; hence the public are empowered
to appropriate the whole fruit of a patentee’s brains if for
any reason, accidental or otherwise, he happen to have
claimed an item too much, or otherwise erred. The
rights of the public as against patentees are therefore
different under the two sets of conditions, and the rights
of both parties must be adequately respected. It is
clear, however, that so far as N.S.W. is concerned an
equitable vested interest resides in only those who have
already accepted the chance offered, and gone into posses-
sion of the patent property in defiance of the patentee.
The amendment accepted by Gould adopts this idea, for
it declared an amended patent to be ineffectual against
parties who had commenced before the passing of the
Act, whilst it preserved the efficacy of the patent against
all who had not so established an equitable vested interest.
The Broken Hill discussion is only by the way. If Ash-
croft or anyone else robbed the company of an invention
to which it was entitled then the co. had its remedy ; but
as it did not proceed to assert itself against Ashcroft
very probably it had no case. But even though the co.
has not proceeded, if the circumstances are as the B.H.
members state, it can use the weapon fatally against Ash-
croft’s patent when it pleases.
To make the Act applicable to future patents only is
preposterous. If the principle of amendment is good
then adopt it, having made such provision as will ade-
quately protect equitable rights which actually exist.
And there is danger of a patentee making a mistake in
his specifications. Ask any patent-agent how often in the
year he meets cases of re-invention, or overlapping sug-
gestions, or adumbrations of subsequently developed
ideas. A patentee or his patent-agent cannot know
everything, and in a very large proportion of cases the
most extreme caution and the widest experience will be
baffled. I have before me two sketches of mechanism
designed by myself, parts of both of which were indepen-
dently invented within a few weeks by a Parisian and a
South Australian and patented by them. Also, I once
made a search to ascertain novelty in a nut-lock ; examined
over 700 patents for different devices, none of which
touched the one in question ; but the German Patent
Office discovered one morp somewhere, and it had some-
thing in common with the lock searched against. And
what is the use of saying that patent-experts are familiar
with up-to-date progress? The Dunlop pneumatic tyre
looked new enough, so far as everyone knew, until some-
one discovered that a patent was granted for it 50 years
ago. The writer has just completed a search in British
patents, extending back only 20 years, and he has dis-
covered over 100 patents all for inventions more or iesj
meritorious, but nearly every orle overlapping more ot
! ess ’ , when th ® s ® a f e hf ! w dde * an u i,1 h v o e ” t °!
know how much he is entitled to claim, though he may
know how much he has invented—or reinvented—and, if
his claims cover more than he is enr.itled to, though no
more than he has honestly invented, it will not avail him,
for the courts must and will invalidate his patent,
The very numerous decisions in the law-books define
what “substantially” means, and a reference to any
hand-book of patent law will readily clear the mind as to
what is and what is not, generally speaking, art allowable
amendment under the provisions of the British Acts 1883-8*
Make a final appeal to the Supreme Court by all means,
and g 0 gj V e all parties every chance. But, because the Bill
provides that leave to amend is conclusive as to right to
amend and that the amendment shall, for all purposes,
stand part of the specification, do not run away with the
idea that the patent as amended is riot subject to the same
revision when it comes before the courts as if it were not
amended. It must, if contested, stand its trial just the
same, and you will find numerous cases of British amended
patents having been declared void for reasons for which
unamended patents could be voided, and also because the
amendment was not of the kind contemplated by the law,
though it had been allowed in the regular way. (See Van
Olde’s Pat., 6 P.0.R., p. 22, and Lane Fox’s case.)
The objection which many, whose opinion should be
respected, have against the Bill, is that it should have
been introduced as part of a consolidated measure. For
many years efforts have been made to induce various
N.S.W. Govts, to codify the law relating to patents and
to bring it up to date. At present there are three acts
in existence ; the present Bill, if passed, will
make a fourth. There is no more pressing need
for the two provisions of this Bill than there is for
about a dozen other provisions, equally important with
the first. Let the Government abandon the present
Bill and bring in a comprehensive measure, dealing with
the whole subject. The interests involved in N.S. Wales
patents total millions of pounds sterling. Surely paten-
tees and the public are entitled to ask that the old out-of-
date legislation of 1852 be swept away and something
suitable to the needs of the day put in its stead. The
Patents Office, which provides a yearly profit of about
£2OOO to the revenue, has been recently stuck into a
corner of the Registrar-General’s Department, where
there is not half accommodation, and seems to have been
relegated to the status of a mere recoi ding-office , and
the very important legal and technical functions of
F^ 1 a V liri ®, r *? ave keen r ust into the alrea ,}
tud hands of the Registrar-General. The tune is cone
when the Patents Office of this country should be an inst-
tution, but the idea of the authorities seems rather to be
to L lfc as a means for extracting revenue from the brains
of the community, to stunt the usefulness of what should
be the Alma . Ma ter of industrial development, and to give
as few facilities as possible for the distribution of technical
knowledge through its medium. It is a principle acknow-
led d u^iversa ,ifr that the Patents Institution should do
nQ more than •' its W ay, for ibs mission is to develop
techniea j knowledge, and the result of its work is
dilninighed in proportion as those who avail themselves of
its advantages are taxed. If the N.S.W. authorities will
not therefore give the inventing public the advantages for
which they ar ° pay ing, then the inventing public should
not be cal j ed 0 / to ply into the Patents Office so large a

Fortunate Cure of a General’s
Daughter.
(From, the “Hampshire Independent."
The Hampshire Independent sent a special commis-
sioner to ascertain the facts in the following- case. His
report was as follows :—“ I received instructions to inter-
view Lieut.-Gen. Clement R. Shaw, who has won his
spurs in India, and is now living with his family in honor-
able retirement at St. Paul’s Vicarage, Shanklin, Isle of
Wight.
“ I explained to the General that I was anxious to ob-
tain some personal explanation as to the narrow escape I
had heard one of his daughters had recently experienced.
“At that he brightened visibly. ‘ You must know,’ he
said, ‘ I’m just a bit of an enthusiast on this point ; but
the tale is very short. Nearly two years ago my daughter
—the one you referred to -came home from India, and
when I joined her in London I found her ill in bed. She
had rheumatic and neuralgic pains ; she was perfectly
bloodless, listless, and in a generally weak and prostrate
condition. We called in a doctor, and lam bound to say
that he succeeded in getting her out of bed; but she was
still absolutely colourless, was in great wretchedness, and
suffering from what I should call anaemia, or bloodless-
ness. She had a kind of fever, nervous headache, and
other pains. We went to Bembridge, in the Isle of Wight,
and there I first heard of Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills for
Pale People. Indeed, I was recommended to try them,
and I did so. My daughter took the first box, and they
had a marvellous effect upon her. She regained her
colour; she lost her pains, and became altogether dif-
ferent ; and after she had been taking them some time she
came in one day after her walk and said to me, ‘ Why,
father, I feel quite a glow through me.’ She went on
taking the Pills, and I am glad to tell you that she re-
covered completely. My daughter’s recovery was due to
Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills for Pale People without a doubt.
Their effects were marvellous, and I did not speak with-
out first ascertaining the facts. I have had a great deal
to do with medical men in this country and in India, and
they laugh at the idea that patent medicines cure any
disease. But I have given you this case, and that I know ;
I won’t deal with any beyond my own personal experience
and knowledge, further than to say that I believe the
results to have been satisfactory.’ ”
The Terrible Influenza.
ITS RAVAGES ARE APPALLING ONLY PROMPT
MEASURES CAN RESTORE THE SUFFERER TO
HEALTH.
The people of this country have good cause to view with
alarm an outbreak of influenza, as it leaves behind it more
shattered constitutions than any other known disease. Mr.
Edward Botting, for ten years a councillor of the united
townships of Bedford, Olden and Palmerston, in Frontenac
County, is one who nearly fell a victim to this scourge.
To a Whig correspondent Mr. Botting said : “ About two
3 ears ago I had a bad attack of influenza, and the after-
effects of that malignant trouble brought me so low that
my friends despaired of my recovery. I was troubled with
severe and constant pains in the back, sensations of ex-
treme dizziness, weakness, and was in fact in a generally
used-up condition. I had read frequently of Dr. Williams’
1 mk Pills, and felt they must have some special virtues
else they could not obtain such strong endorsations in all
parts of the country. I determined to try them, and I
bless the day that I came to that conclusion. Before the
first box was finished I felt benefited, and I continued
H]? 11 ’ use u _ntil I was as strong as ever. I consider Dr.
Williams Pink Pills the best medicine sold, and I would
not be without them in the house if they cost me $5 a
box.
r
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have had marvellous success in
removing- the after-effects of influenza, and restoring suf-
ferers to their former vigor. No other medicine can
accomplish the results they achieve, and those who have
suffered with influenza should use them without delay.
PALE AND SALLOW GIRLS.
What can be more distressing than to see a girl droop-
ing and fading in the springtime of youth ? Instead of
bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and an elastic step,
there are dull eyes, pale, sallow', or greenish complexion,
and a languidness of step that bespeak disease and an
early death if proper treatment is not promptly resorted
to and persisted in until the impoverished blood is en-
riched and the functions of life become regular. Upon
parents rests a great responsibility at the time their
daughters are budding into womanhood. If yourdaughter
is pale, complains of weakness, is “tired out” upon the
slightest exertion ; if she is troubled w'ith headache or
backache, pain in the side, if her temper is fitful, and her
appetite poor, she is in a condition of extreme peril, a fit
subject for the development of that most dreaded of all
diseases—Consumption. If you notice any of the above
symptoms lose no time in procuring Dr. Williams’s Pink
Pills. They will assist the patient to develop properly
and regularly ; they will enrich the blood and restore
health’s roses to the cheeks ; bright eyes and lightness of
step will surely follow their use, and all danger of con-
sumption and premature death will be averted. Wise and
prudent mothers will insist upon their daughters taking
Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills upon the approach of the period
of puberty, and thus avoid all chances of disease or early
decay.
Dr. Williams’s Pink Pills are a sure remedy for rheu-
matism, Neuralgia, Paralysis, Locomotor Atax3', St. Vitus
Dance, Nervous Headache, Scrofula, Chronic Erysipelas,
&c. They are not a purgative, but they restore pale and
yellow complexions to the glow of health, and are a
specific for troubles peculiar to the female, while in men
they effect a radical cure in all cases arising from worry,
overwork, or excess of any nature. Dr. Williams’s Pink
Pills are obtainable from all leading chemists, or from the
Dr. Williams’s Medicine Company, Queen’s-place, Sydney,
who will forward (post paid) on receipt of stamps or post-
office order, 1 Box for 2s. 9d., or a half-a-dozen for 14s. 9d
RHEUMATISM and INDIGEST ON are POSITIVELY CURED by

An Answered Prayer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Johnny Brown sat on the paling-fence watching
with the intentness of his nine years the boys as
they passed in ones and twos along the street lead-
ing to the Cleveland paddocks. Johnny was
shabby enough, and his little shirt peeped out of
his nroken trousers ; but what troubled him most,
however, were his boots. His mother, over-
burthened with the care of a large family, had
ordered him not to go out of the yard, as he was
not tidy enough ; besides, running about the
streets would wear out his only pair of boots, and
1 1 would be many a day before he was likely to
get another pair. His mother had hidden away
liis boots lest he should disobey, and he was hardly
likely to go out without them. It was a sort of
recognised rule amongst working people who lived
in those days at the Strawberry Hills that boys
who wore boots were to be considered respectable
—the condition of the rest of their raiment did
not count.
Johnny was aware that he would be looked
down on if he went out without boots, and he
respected public opinion ; but he also knew that
boots or no boots he would get a ‘' hiding ” from his
father if he disobeyed his mother, and the fear of
chastisement was an even stronger incentive to
obedience than anything people were likely to say
about him. If only his mother’s wrath was con-
cerned, Johnny would “ chance it,” but his father’s
hand was heavy, especially if he were ill-tempered
• —and he mostly was so unless he had taken drink,
when he was disposed to be playful as a child.
All this passed through Johnny’s mind as he sat
drumming his bare heels against the fence. Tommy
Bray and Arohie Mitchell passed under him carry-
ing bat and ball, with “Ain’t yercoming, Johnny?”
which was very trying to the said Johnny, who
found it necessary to hold tight to the fence in
order to combat the magnetic pull of the cricket
things. So long as they were in sight he managed
to resist, but when they had turned the corner,
Johnny found himself outside the fence, but still
irresolute. Just then a shout from some boys as
they rushed along the main street broke down any
lingering resolution, and away Johnny scampered
to join the fun.
In the whirl of excitement everything but the
game was forgotten—want of boots, out without
leave, the certain thrashing. But all things end,
and, play over, Johnny found himself once more
climbing the fence and back again in his own
yard.
The Conrads lived next door to the Browns,
and Tom Conrad, who had been sober for a full
month, felt very virtuous. “ Well, Polly,” said he
to his wife as he lifted the latch, “ here I am. I
saw Brown in William-street, and he wanted me
to have a drink, but I wasn’t on.”
“Well, I must say,” said his wife, “those
Brown youngsters are very good, considering their
father, Look there,” continued she, “there is
little Johnny kneeling down saying his prayers in
the yard. I’ll give him a piece of bread-and-jam
presently, that I will.” And so it was—there was
Johnny kneeling against a tree thumping his
breast and praying as if his little heart would
break.
Safe inside his own yard, Johnny began to fear
the consequences of his escapade. He was a
nervous boy, who took his trouncings very well,
finding more pain in the anticipation than in the
reality. His mother was certain to inform his
father of his disobedience, and his father rarely
spared the rod where his children were concerned.
It was Saturday and pay-day, and sometimes his
father came home drunk on pay-day, and when he
was drunk he was incapable of punishing anyone.
This was Johnny’s only chance of escaping. He
was not sure whether his father had yet come
home or not, but Johnny was hardly over the
fence before he fell on his knees and poured out
his humble little heart in supplication that the
Almighty might be pleased to send his father home
—drunk.
It was in this attitude that Mrs. Conrad saw
him. “ Poor little fellow,” she said ; “ may my
boys grow up like him ! ” Presently, looking
up, she saw Johnny’s father passing the door.
“ What a drunken beast he is ! ’ she said.
Little Johnny’s prayer had been heard.
HENRY SIEREL.
The clergy of Melb. (except the R.C.’s)
have risen as one parson to denounce lotteries of
all kinds. What about marriage ?
At Balclutha (M.L.), the district that is
sicklied o’er with the pale cast of Cold Tea, and
where good brown ale is sold secretly disguised in
a cruet down a cellar by a person who lies about it
afterwards, the police lately raided a sly groggery
at 3 a.m. They found five men who all explained
eloquently before the local authority next morn-
ing. One had been going somewhere (at 3 a.m.)
to get his coat and boots (what his coat and boots
were doing there weren’t explained), and just out-
side the groggery a complete stranger had hit him
such a welt that he had to be carried in and
attended to at once. The second man was the
person who had helped him in. The third, a
barber (who had dropped in at 3 a.m. to borrow a
match) had stopped to cut the hair off the wound.
A person alleged to be a doctor, seeing the barber
going in, had gone in after him (at 3 a.m.) to tell
him how his brother was, and stayed to dress the
injury. The remaining individual saw the light
in the window and burst in to see if the place was
on fire. Then the police unfortunately arrived.
Whereupon The Bulletin is of opinion that there
are some very futile Jules Vernes in the cranky
region of Balclutha. Anyhow, in a Prohibition
district no tale that anyone can invent is likely to
account for five men and a smell of whisky being
found in a strange house at 3 a.m. Therefore, it
would have been much more sensible and a better
advt. for the barber and the other men if they
had told the P.M. straight that they were drink-
ing, that they had been drinking before and
meant to do it again, that Cold Tea was stupid
and comfortless and indigestible and bad for
the kidneys, and that if he didn’t like
it he could lump it. There is room at
Balclutha for the biggest and most theatri-
cal protest against Cold Tea that has yet
been attempted. What is wanted is for all the
drinking residents of the district to get together
by agreement on a suitable occasion—say Xmas
Day—and sell drink publicly to each other till the
solitary policeman comes and runs in or summons
the whole 700 or so. Then let them all own up
straight, and say they will take it out instead of
paying the fine, and defy the P.M. to get them
into the lock-up and get the door shut. And if the
State sends two special trains to take them down
to Dunedin to serve their sentence the great un-
controllable mob could break out at every stop-
ping place and drink itself incapable, and when
it got to its destination there wouldn’t be
enough wheelbarrows in the city to remove it
on. Then the Big Drunk of Balclutha would
become historical.
He Let His Heart Go.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wind whistled, and every now and
then threw a splash of sleety rain against the
fissured face of a bleached, grey rock. A cavity
in its centre looked to the south-west, whence
wind and rain came ; and although the hole ex-
tended a good way the chill gusts occasionally
reached the farthest corner. Gyp Pringle crawled
back as far as possible and built up a barricade of
coarse packing-paper which he had carried on his
back from Sydney warehouses.
Dog-weariness made him sleep. He had tramped
town and suburbs all day in search of work—the
gate to bread and beef and, mayhap, ale. As he
closed his eyes the rattle of reed and brass music
was borne across the Domain from the precincts
of Government House.
Soon he dreamed. What a heaven of gratifica-
tions was spread before him ! Beef, potatoes, ale,
whisky, tobacco. He stretched out a hungry
hand. Alas ! here he awoke.
Realising the cruel hoax, he kicked viciously.
To his surprise his foot struck something soft, a
composite of flesh and blood, and a plaintive
whine made humble protest.
“Now, then,” said Gyp, “who the devil are
you? This hole’s mine. No doubt you’re a
Socialist. Well, clear out. I didn’t slope the
town an’ hump this here swag o’ old paper an’ root
out this bloomin’ marble hall for the benefit o’ the
community at large. I done it for mesolf. I’m a
individualist—l am. So take yerself to gaol or
glory out o’ this.”
Only heavy breathing answered.
“D’ye want me to bash yer? G’up to Guv-
ment House, can’t yer ? They’re singin’ an’coort-
in’ up there, I believe, an’ ye might be able to
collar a fan or spoon when nobody’s lookin’. Clear
out, I say ! ”
This time the whine became a subdued bark,
and a cold nose was thrust into his hollow hand.
“Me bloomin’ ead ! ye’re a dawg ! An’ I took
ye all the time for a Socialist ! I beg parding
humbly. All the same though—out ye go. If a
coal-heaver snooked into ’Ampden’s, out he’d go.
If I snooked into a coal-heaver’s, out I’d go. An’
as this hole’s my castle, out you go. An’ if you
had a kennel an’ I attempted to snook in, out /’d
go. See? We’re all, except them mad Socialists,
thorough individualists. ”
He kicked.
“ Sometimes though, notwithstanding me logic,
I’ve thought that if those on top were a bit kinder
to the folk below it might be better all round.
It’s not me brain says that ; it’s me heart.”
He kicked again.
“If, when a coal-heaver snooked into Governor
’Ampden’s, that well-paid Nabob gave ’im time to
draw breath before firin’ ’im out; or when I
snooked into the coal-heaver’s, or when this out-
cast dawg snooked in here ”
He drew up his foot smartly.
“Well, now,” he said, sitting up, “dammut,
but I’ll give me heart her way for onst. Let her
go, Gallagher ! ”
* ♦ * *
When daylight came Gyp examined his
partner in adversity, and recognised that the dog
belonged to a lady in whose garden he had had
a couple of days’ work a week or two before.
This he considered an extremely gratifying dis-
covery.
“Me bloomin’ ’ead!” he exclaimed; “this
means a big reward, if it doesn’t lead to a con-
stant job, with a liberal pension for me old age ! ”
Laying hold of a piece of rope and looping it
round the famished creature’s neck, he continued :
“ It’s a pound if it’s a thankee. No doubt, the
dawg’s been lost for a time, for the hair’s peelin’
off. He’s seen the inside o’ Belmore more’n onst,
I’ll go bail. An to think I struck this patch o’
luck the first time I let me heart go ! This’ll
make a different man o’ me for the future. ‘Do a
kind hact ’ will be my motter. I venture to say
most people with that motter found a dawg to
start them. Come along, old boy ; off to Darlin’
Point to reap the reward o’ virtue ! Yer mistress
’ll be that glad to see yer face that she’ll likely
keep me for dinner an’ fit me in a suit o’ good, dry
clothes.”
» * * *
“What have you to say?” asked the
spectacled Stipendiary.
“That dawg came to me under a rock in the
Domain, an’—
“ There’s too much of this going on. You ob-
tained work in this lady’s garden with the clear
intention of making friends with the dog. You
were seen about the place several times since.
Then you induce the dog off and keep him in your
low haunts until a reward is offered. Sydney is
cursed with loafers of your stamp. Three months’
hard labor.”
Gyp : “ This is the first time I ever let me heart
go, an’ if ever ”
But he was hauled away, crying, at the top of
his voice : “ I’m a individualist for the rest o’ me
bloomin’ life, I am ! ”
OMICRON.
My Heart’s Desire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I watch her in the early morn
Trip down the street, my dwelling past;
She hurries on, and I, forlorn,
Lament, yet love, her pace so fast;
Her vision haunts me all the day,
My work I leave but scarce alive,
And pass the hours as best I may
Till she returns at half-past five.
I watch her in the gathering gloom
Come speeding homeward cheerfully,
And quake to think I’ve met my doom.
The future has grave fears for me :
For I am sure she is my fate
(Or, as it’s called, “affinity”),
Yet am I feared that May and Kate
And she won’t prove a “ trinity.”
What shall Ido ? May is my wife,
Kate is her sister tall and fair :
One holds the cash, one rules my life,
And both abhor—that chestnut mare !

The following letter from Mrs. S. Gash, of Kent Town, So. Australia,
whose portrait is given above, is additional testimony to the remarkable
health-giving power of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla:
“For two years or njore I suffered considerably from indigestion,
sleeplessness, and loss of strength and appetite. When I did sleep I was
not refreshed, and I always had a severe headache in the morning. I was
induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and was more than pleased at the
result, for after taking three bottles my complaints disappeared, and I
have been in the best of health ever since. I can strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to any one afflicted as I was.”
The wonderful success of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in purifying the blood and
restoring health and strength to systems enfeebled by disease, or the enervat-
ing effect of a warm climate, has led to the placing on the market of other
preparations called Sarsaparilla. Remember that imitation is the sheer-
est form of flattery, and be sure that you get AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
which has stood the test of time, has won the highest awards at the world’s
great expositions, and has been a blessing to the people of Australia, and
all civilized countries, for more than a generation. ]STo other medicine operates
so effectually in removing general debility, languor, and all outward symp-
toms of the grave mischief caused by disordered nerves and impure blood.

A NARROW ESCAPE,
“The Men who Make England.*
We are indebted to the courtesy of a gentleman well known in
Liverpool for the following interesting and instructive particulars. He
writes
I venture to think the following will be read with interest by
you and any English people who have friends abroad, and their name
is legion. Quite recently I was a passenger by the midnight train
from Euston to Liverpool. I was travelling in a third-class compart-
ment, and with me there was a quiet, resolute - looking man about
thii ty-five, a middle-aged sailor, and a young fellow who stated he was
twenty-two. The latter informed us he was sailing from Liverpool to
Lagos, on the West Coast of Africa, in the course of a few days,
which drew from our quiet-looking friend, ‘Queer place, Lagos. I was
there eighteen months.’ ‘Unhealthy?’ ‘Rather; just about the worst
you can hit on. but X kept fairly right.’ ‘ How did you manage ? ’
‘Well, take this from me straight—cut all spirits, brandy especially,
and always have Beecham’s Pills handy.’ ‘Beecham's Pills?’ ‘Yes;
I’ve knocked about the world a good deal, and am just off to Rangoon,'
where I have a berth cutting teak, and I should never feel safe without
them.’ ‘Right you are,’ chimed in the sailor. ‘I was in Brazil,
Santos, but a few months ago, and they were the regular thing for
keeping you right out there. I came home last week, and here is my
last last box, producing one from out of his waistcoat pocket. This testi-
mony from ‘ the men who make England ’ was perfectly genuine, and it
gives me pleasure to communicate it to you.
“I will just add the following, which was read to me the other
day, it being an extract of a letter from a prosperous young magistrate
at Esk, Queensland, to his father in Liverpool : ‘I am exceedingly busy,
and on Saturdays can hardly get through; and just now, if a customer
does not ask for wire fencing, he is certain to want Beecham’s Pills.
You had better send me further consignments of these sharp.’*
Here you have Australia, West Africa, Eastern A.ia, and Brazil*
And climates good and bad. We often hear, “ Glo where you will you
will find Englishmen,” but we must now add! “ and BEE'CHAM’S
PILLS.”

Bonnington & Co., Manufacturers of Irish Moss.
~ ea 3 Sirs,— Being a sufferer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I desire to
add my testimony in favor of your Irish Moss. As a soother of irritating cough, with much ex-
vy oration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything I have tried. It loosens the mucus,
winch, therefore, comes more readily away, and the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
Yours respectfully, THOMAS STOKER.
