A REAL CHINAMAN.
Passenger T. C. Crane, floating on his
meat-safe after the wreck of the
was addressed by a Chinaman who swam up
to partake of the meat-safe’s hospitality.
“ More better you go catchey ’nother piecey
box,” said the Chinaman. “ More better
you,” responded Mr. Crane, winking a
watery eye ; and the colloquy ended.
That pregnant conversation was conducted
in “ pidgin-English,” the vernacular of the
Chinese treaty-ports. “Pidgin-English” is
a corruption of “ business English,” and
Chester Holcombe, in “The Real China-
man ” (cloth, Bs.) —the most interesting book
ever written about China—gives other amus-
ing examples of its use.
When King Kalakaua, of the Hawaiian Islands,
was in Shanghai in April, 1881, he occupied a
suite of rooms up one flight of stairs at the Astor
House. Two American gentlemen, desiring to
pay their respects to His Majesty, went to the
hotel one morning, and meeting the proprietor at
the foot of the stairs, made known their errand,
and enquired if the king was in. “I will see,’’ re-
plied the landlord, and tu lining on his heel, he
shouted to a Chinese servant at the head of the
stairs; “Boy! That piecey king top side hab
got?” “Hab got,” laconically responded the
servant. “ Gentlemen,” said the landlord, “His
Majesty is in. Pray walk up. ”
With such quaint gems do Mr. Holcombe’s
pages sparkle. His style is a model—
nervous, compact, restrained, the embodi-
ment of supple strength. Generally in
repose, it sometimes leaps out on you with a
fine image—as in a contrast of Japan with
China :
Japan, in discarding Oriental fashions for Wes-
tern, was, in the main, merely casting off borrowed
clothing. Those of China, on the contrary, are of
her own devising, and have been slowly and
laboriously woven as the shuttle of time passed
to and fro through many centuries.
Even did space permit, no quotation could
do “The Real Chinaman” full justice. Every
page has its plum; and for each it is possible
to pick hundreds remain on the tree. The
book deals with Chinese government, lan-
guage, home and social life, religions—there
are three commonly practised ; Confucianism,
Buddhism, and Taoism superstitions,
queues, courts of law, officials and people,
education and literature, etiquette and cere-
mony, merchants and tiicks of trade, the
poor, and the Chinese financial system. It
has the vital quality of complete knowledge
—so far as complete knowledge of China is
possible to a European ; the author was for
10 years secretary to the U.S. Legation at
Peking, and, an able observer, he seems never
to have missed one of his exceptional oppor-
tunities for observing.
One abridged extract, to illustrate the
methods of Chinese justice. A number of
Chinese are charged with assaulting -an
American :
The magistrate, a venerable and pleasant-faced
man of 70, turned to one of them and said, in a
familiar -way :
“You tell us all about it now. Why did you beat
the American ? Tell us the whole story.”
“ But I did not beat him, your Excellency,”
said the man. “ I wasn’t there. Besides, lam a
good man, A thousand times ten thousand it is
true I never touched him.”
“Oh, yes ! we know all about that,” rejoined
the magistrate. “ Such a good son of Han as you
ure wouldn’t harm a baby ; but, all the same,
what made you do it ? Of course, we know you
did not do it; in fact, you were in bed and asleep
when the deed was done. At the same time, it
will save us a lot of bother if you confess. Of
course, you did not mean any harm ; we are sure
of that. You wanted a little fun, and had heard
some talk about the streets that if someone wmuld
only frighten the foreigner, or give him a drub-
bing, he would leave town and never return,’and
so you thought you would try it. 'Certainly you
were not there ; but you beat him just the same
as though you were.”
Thus the garrulous old man ran on for more
than an hour, quizzing, bantering, and persuading
the accused, who, whenever an opening gave him
chance to be heard, reiterated his innocence, but
in tones noticeably growing fainter and less posi-
tive. At last he said : “ But I did not hit him as
hard as some of the others did.” Quick as a flash
the magistrate retorted : “You did hit him, then?
Come, now, tell us about it.” And then the
prisoner, with his head hanging down and with
the air of a school-boy caught sticking pins into
the master’s chair, said: “Well, if I must, I
must. Perhaps 1 did give him a shove.”
“ That is right,” said the judge, “ we knew you
did ; but it is always better to confess.”
Eight shillings is a good deal for a book in
these times ; but, to the seeing mind, this
book is well worth it.
PERIODICALS.
Public Opinion is an English paper (20s. 6d.
per annum posted throughout Australasia) which
has not nearly the circulation it'deserves. Its
method has been copied by the Review op
Reviews, but Public Opinion is much the more
valuable. In the first place, it is weekly and up-
to-date, instead of monthly and behind-hand.
Then it scissors its stuff with more discrimination
to secure current interest, and good articles are
clipped in extenso, instead of being lopped to an
irritating Procrustean measure. To the far-away
person with a shallow purse and a hankering to be
kept abreast of topics of the day, Public Opinion
is strongly recommended as the cheapest and best
compendium available.
“ Form at a Glance ” (Is. Id.), is worth every
racing-man’s money. It indexes admirably the
performances of every horse entered for Caulfield
and Melb. Cups, 1895; and tabulates in addition
the weight-for-age scale; fastest time records;
past winners; length of principal race-courses ;
registered colours, and current weights.
“Sarony’s Sketch-Book” (Is. Bd.), of which
nine numbers are now issued, has had a deservedly
large sale in Australasia. Some of the early num-
bers contained real gems of art in the way of
photos, from the nude, and the level is still fairly
maintained. Each number contains 12 pictures,
often reproductions of celebrated paintings ; and
the publication, as a whole, is one of the most
artistic ever issued. The only points for cavil
are the insignificant features of the models
who represent Cleopatra, Zenobia, &c. The forms
are generally all right, though some of them err
considerably on the side of dumpiness; but the
faces are strikingly characterless and expression-
less.
The Englishwoman (12s. a year; single numbers,
9d.) maintains a good level as a ladies’ magazine.
Marie Belloc’s articles on “French Authors of
To-day ” are a pleasant feature. The English-
woman is more modem than the Woman at Home
(single numbers, 9d.; per annum, 125.), which
is respectable and a little heavy.
The first three numbers of the “ Penny Poets ”
series—Macaulay’s “Lays,” Scott’s “Marmion,”
Byron’s “ Childe Harold, ”&c., (first two cantos) —
are well worth a 2d. stamp each.

As a rule, to print a book in London costs about
half as much as to print it in Australia. This
fact naturally has weight with even patriotic
authors who bring out their own books —especially
as unpatriotic readers add a cwt. or so by showing
marked preference for a London imprint. But cir-
cumstances seem changing. Francis Kenna’s charm-
ing poems were recently issued in a very neat
edition of 250 copies, which cost about A 25 to
produce, or 2s. a copy. The London price
would have been about <£l7 10s., but the author
would probably have lost the advantage of correct-
ing his proofs—how great an advantage only those
who have suffered from erratic English printers’-
readers can testify! Mr. J. D. Hennessey’s
clever new Australian novel, “ The Dis
Honourable ” (35.), which covers between 200'
and 300 pages of long-primer type, was printed
and bound in Sydney at a cost of about <£loo for
20t;0 copies, including a complete set of stereo,
plates. This is about the cheapest Australian rate
on record.

COUGHS. COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RABIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete rare is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cess! ul under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; lie did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a. speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

Q Xjr JF*. S B L V 3E3 S !
We wish It to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves pIJBLIO BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life —honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from the common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the majority, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, but if the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
never cease from their toil ; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppressed by the cruel frost of
somewhiie baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

MICK O’ROURKE, EVANGELIST.
It was Mick O’Rourke, the Ringer, bailed up
Father Flynn one day,
As his Reverence was riding by upon his ewe-
necked bay—
Mick was shearing then at Tarbuo, in the neigh-
borhood of Hay.
“ Is it Michael ? ” said the clergyman ; who knew
him as a droll
Sort of sinner ; tough as Satan ; yet a white man,
on the whole;
“ Son, I trust that you are doing well, and think-
ing of your soul ! ”
“ Thank your Rivirence,” said Michael, “ ye wor
always mighty kyind ;
lam doin’ purty middlin’; and me sowl is well-
inclined :
But the rayson why I stopped you is—l’m
throubled in me mind !
“Since we started here, at Tarbuo, I’ve been
Ringer of the shed—
Though I’ve had to fight, as well as shear, to keep
a bit ahead —
Faix, I put the fear of Fisht in thim that had no
other dhread.
“And I’ve done my best to keep the shed in
ordher from the first,
Though there’s chaps here that I think wor in
religion’s lap d/iry-nursed
There’s a cove or two from Pinthridge, and a man
from Dariin’hurst.
“ But they’re dacent min to work wid —though
there’s some av thim have odd
Ways wid kyards, and talkin’ slang, sor, which
they larnt, no doubt, in quod—
Barrin’ wan, a Milburrne chap, who says he don’t
believe in God.
“Sor, a more conthrairy customer than him I niver
saw;
There is no one here can aiqual him at workin’
wid the jaw :
Which comes aisy to him, seein’ he was brought
up to the law.
“Well, I’ve raysoned wid him calmly, and me
words in meekness dhrist;
I’ve remonsthered wid a shovel, and I’ve argeyed
wid me fist ;
But I’ve failed to make a Ohrischin av that Mil-
burrne Atheist.
“ So I thought, when I tuk notice av yer Rivirince
passin’ near,
I would ax ye what was best to do, and ye wud
make it clear;
For I mean to give the shed a sign—“ No Hay-
thens wanted here. ”
“ Mick, ray son,” said Father Flynn, “ don’t try
to bear another’s load !
Let God’s judgment fall upon him—as it will in
some strange mode.”
And the priest gave Mick his blessing, and con-
tinued on his road.
Mick the Ringer smiled : “ Troth, Father Flynn,
I’ll take yer hint,” said he;
“If God’s judgment’s sure to fall on him —why
shouldn’t that mane me?
Faix, I’ll fall upon him, suddint-like —’twill save
his sowl, maybe.”
There’s a maimed and broken vessel, with an ear
that’s gone astray,
That goes preaching round the stations from
Deniliquin to Hay ;
If you ask him for his story this is what he’s sure
to say :
“ I was once an Unbeliever —yea, a man of Sin
and Shame,
Till at Tarlcuc, ’midst affliction dire, converted I
became
By a powerful evangelist—O’Rourke it was his
name. ”

RECONCILIATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Brown, burnt-armed, he worked from sunrise
until sunset day by day,
Axeing, clearing, burning, fencing, building,
laying out a home,
And when done he caught his horse and, canter-
ing the nearest way
Townward, found his wife, law-sundered years
ago, and bade her come.
“Nan,” he simply said, “come with me ! ” Nan
looked up in mute surprise
And beheld long, wild night-revels, splashed
with blood and drenched with tears,
And the sword of legal sev’rance; but behind
these saw the eyes,
And within the eyes the heart that throbbed to
hers in far-off years.
And her answer was, “I will.” Then at the
words Love, with a cry,
Seized and killed the wild night mem’ries, and
the sword of sev’rance broke ;
And above the re-united spread a re-illumined
sky,
And the old songs of the dead years once again
to music woke.

The Exemption Clause.
When the Land Tax Bill makes its reap-
pearance in New South Wales Parliament
the great struggle, it is already obvious, will
turn on the proposed exemption of holdings
up to the value of £475. The Upper House
has already given its voice decisively against
the exemption, and professes its willingness
to pass the measure if made to apply equally
all round, but otherwise it threatens to
oppose it to the bitter end. The Daily
Telegraph —the recognised organ of the
Reid Government—also opposes the exemp-
tion. So did Mr. B. R. Wise, and so,
also, does part, at all events, of the
Opposition. The Premier formerly expressed
himself as absolutely neutral, if not actively
hostile, but since the majority of the last
Assembly insisted on inserting an exemption
clause he has declared himself a warm
adherent of the principle. The majority of
the present Assembly is also believed to be
in its favor. As for the nation, its opinion
on the subject is doubtful; it declared, in a
tolerably detinite way, in favor of the
Land-tax principle, but a general election
is a vague and unsatisfactory process, and,
at the best, it gives but a glimmering as
to the popular sentiment. The probabilities
are that the community has no definite
opinion on the exemption clause. A
desire to tax the other man is a con-
spicuous feature in everybody’s character.
Therefore the majority of the community
believes in a Land-tax because it owns no
land, and the great body of small land-
holders believe in a land-tax with the pro-
posed margin because it will itself go free.
But it is not all likely that the non-land-
holder cares whether the small owner is free
or not. And it is certain that the large
land-holder wants the tax to apply equally
allround, in the hope hit the small holder
will lose his love for the new impost when
he feels in his own person what it is like.
• x • #
On this question The Bulletin gives its
vote unhesitatingly with the Reid party. It
regards the Land-tax Bill as a somewhat
clumsy and ill-constructed affair, inasmuch
as it recognises no gradations, and taxes the
owner with £lO,OOO worth of land at the
same rate as the one with £lOO 000 worth.
Also, it draws no distinctions between the
man who cultivates or occupies his own laud,
and the one who sublets it and lives on the
rent, and the other one who neither culti-
vates nor occupies nor allows anyone else to
occupy, but holds the land for purely specu-
lative purposes, and thereby blocks settle-
ment and becomes a public evil. But while
the omission of the graduation principle
does much to destroy the purpose —or
what ought to be the purpose—of the
measure, the excision of the exemption
clause would only alter it still further
for the worse. The Bulletin takes this
view fully recognising that the public has
never had a chance—and cannot have one
except through the medium of the Referen-
dum—to fully express its opinion on the
subject, and also recognising that it may
have, at present, no very definite opinion to
express. Also, it recognises quite as fully
that the small land-holder may, under certain
conditions, be much richer and much better
able to pay a Land-tax than the large one,
and that the person who owns no laud at all
may be a richer capitalist than either of
them.
• « «
In this paper’s view, the Land-tax is not a
gospel, but an expedient. Gospels are
mostly extinct nowadays, and whoever at-
tempts to uphold any political creed, whether
it be Siugle-tax, Freetrade, Prohibition,
Protection, or any other, on the ground that
it is a creed to be followed for its own sake
and to be bolstered up with quotations from
the apostles and the prophets, is mostly
sawing the empty air. The case for a tax
which will apply equally to all land-holders,
large and small, is largely based on the
theory that the private ownership of land is
in itself a sin, and should be visited in each
case with the same penalty. The Bulletin
cares very little whether it is a sin or not.
What it considers is the obvious fact that in
a country of large estates there are a handful
of enormously rich land holders at one end
of the social scale, and at the other a vast mass
of poverty, misery, ignorance, serfdom, and
general discontent, and if the Australian
nation developes along these, lines it will
throw away the greatest chance which any
new community ever possessed. Therefore,
it advocates the State ownership of all lands,
simply in order that all tiie members of the
community may be something like equal
partners in the principal source of national
wealth. But if the same result, or some-
thing approaching it, can be arrived at by
other means, the means themselves matter
comparatively little. If it is possible to
create a system of small independent owner-
ship, so that every man will have a reason-
able chance to own something like his share
of the soil, the result will be much the same.
In neither case can absolute justice ever be
arrived at. If the State owns all the sur-
face of the province it can never, by any
possible process, fix the rents with mathe-
matical accuracy so as to annex all the un-
earned increment which the people create
—all the wisdom of all the Solons
would be insufficient for such a task And
if all the rents of all the lands in the country
flow into the Treasury, and are expended
for public purposes, no human wisdom will
ever distribute them so that every member
of the community will benefit equally, and
hardly anybody is honest enough to attempt
doing so. Similarly, it is possible to make
laws which will tend to the steady sub-
division of the soil down to a certain point,
but though the distribution can thus be
made much more equal than it now is, it
can never be made wholly accurate. Under
these circumstances, The Bulleiin has no
gospel to offer—only an expedient.
* * *
The reasons why the Legislative Council
urges a Land-tax without exemptions are
sufficiently obvious. (1) It will produce
more revenue in the aggregate, the extra
revenue being exacted from the poor—whom
the Council most emphatically does not
represent. (2) Because of this extra revenue
there will be all the less reason to increase
the tax hereafter. (8) The impost will fall
heavily on the small selector, almost the
poorest, hardest-worked, and most hopeless
member of the community, and will force
him to make common cause with the syndi-
cate and the big private monopolist in
demanding its reduction or abolition, or at
least in doing his level best to prevent any
future increase. (4) It will discredit the
Land-tax principle, as showing in an odious
light the conduct of the merchants, impor-
ters, manufacturers, shopkeepers, and all the
great crowd of more or less prosperous non-
laud-holders, even down to the city artisans,
who shift part of the burden of taxation off
their own shoulders to lay it on those of the
struggling selector, who is often less able to
bear it than any of them. And (5) it will
facilitate, rather than prevent, the accumula-
tion of large estates. This latter is a mere
matter of arithmetic. Many a small holder,
whose share of the tax would amount to, say,
£2 per annum, makes in a bad season or a
year of low prices perhaps £7O for his net
income, and, after paying the tax, would
have £6B left. And as the large owner, who
had an income of £7OO from rent and paid
perhaps £4O in taxes, would have £660 left,
lie would evidently be much better able to
stand the strain. This last feature of the
case is more speculative than the others, but
in the long run it would probably work out
in the direction indicated.
The only really important reason to be
advanced in favoring a land-tax without
exemption or gradation is that it would be a
convenient source of revenue. Beyond that
there is nothing to be said in its favor. It
would descend equally on the rich and the
poor, and would bear heavily on the agri-
culturist—the person who is, or should be,
the main support of the State. It would
not get at the unearned increment in any
equitable sense, for it would fall alike on the
man who had bought land at £lO an acre
and seen it rise, without any exertion on his
part, to £lOO, and on the man who had
bought at £3OO an acre sqid seen it fall to
£lOO. It would not discourage large monopo-
lies, or answer any purpose which could not
be answered almost equally well by a poll-
tax or a bread-tax, or any other revenue-
raising expedient. If the sole purpose in
view is to produce an income, then this sys-
tem is undoubtedly commendable, but if the
object is to produce income and at the same
time to exercise some kind of beneficial
effect on the community it has hardly a
single recommendation. At all events, the
same result could be arrived at by a property-
tax in any form.
# • •- _
The object to be attained is to encourage
a race of small independent land-holders,
each living on his own demesne, in prefer-
ence to a vast array of tenants bossed by an
arrogant squirearchy. New South Wales
lias been moving towards this latter destina-
tion for many years past. In 1880, small
holdings—those under 201 acres in extent —
constituted about one-twelfth of the alienated
lauds of the province ; in 1894 they consti-
tuted less than one-twentieth. In the for-
mer year, holdings varying from 201 to 1000
acrea comprised nearly one-fourth of the
total area ; in the latter, they formed about
one-sixth. In 14 years, the total area of the
estates under 201 acres in dimensions
increased by 300,000 acres ; while that
of the estates comprising more than 10,000
acres each increased by 10,800,000 —-
or, roughly speaking, 36 times as fast.
The total area alienated increased by
19,300,000 acres in 14 years, and the very
biggest estates, those of 10,000 acres and
upwards, account for a good deal more than
half of this sum. One-eighth of the whole
alienated area of New South Wales is now
occupied by tenants who pay rent to the
incipient squirearchy aforementioned. The
exemption proposed under the Land-tax Bill
is intended to meet this’ evil ; it will only do
it in a small degree at the best, but still it
will have a definite inclination in the right
direction. Assuming that land yields five
per cent., or Is. in the £ per annum on its
nominal value, a Land-tax of one penny in
the £ means the permanent confiscation of
one-twelfth part of the profits, and reduces
the permanent value of the property in the
same proportion. Therefore, on a vast
estate where the land was formerly worth
£1 an acre it will be worth, under the Land-
tax, only 18s. 4d. But on a small property,
which is below the exemption limit, pro-
vided it is fixed at, say, £475 or £5OO, it
will retain its former value. As a natural
consequence, the property which is worth
18s. 4d. an acre when held as one large taxed
estate can be made worth £1 an acre by sell-
ing it in small lots to individual holders, and
the small farm which is now worth £1 an
acre will have its value reduced to 18s. 4d.
when absorbed into the big estate adjoining.
The result will be an increasing tendency to
sub-division, and a decreasing tendency
towards aggregation. The alleged injustice
to the rich landlord, in the agricultural dis-
tricts at all events, is more real than apparent.
He can escape the impost at any time by
selling out in small lots, and letting all
future unearned increment be divided
throughout the nation, and this is not much
to ask of him, considering the favorable
treatment he has received in the past.
Chinese Missions.
Apt corroboration of The Bulletin’s views
regarding Chinese missions is found in a book
to hand by a recent London mail —Dr. G. E.
Morrison’s “ An Australian in China.” Dr.
Morrison is son to Dr. Geo. Morrison, of
Geelong (Vic.) College, and is the young man
who tramped across Australia from Carpentaria
to Melbourne, and told the story in Melb. Age.
His book is about a trip made from Shanghai
up the Yang-tse-kiang as far as Chungking,
whence he tramped it to the Burma frontier.
He knew no Chinese, had no interpreter, and
had for companions only low-caste coolies, and
be made the journey in Chinese dress, with a
pigtail fastened inside his hat, and without
arms. His very interesting book of travel-notes
will help Australian readers to get rid of many
false impressions. He says himself: “ I went
to China possessed with the strong racial anti-
pathy to the Chinese common to in/country-
men, but that feeling has long since given way
to one of lively sympathy and gratitude, and I
shall always look back with pleasure to this
journey, during which I experienced, while
traversing provinces as wide as European king-
doms, uniform kindness and hospitality, and
the most charming courtesy. In my case, at
least, the Chinese did not forget their precept,
‘ Deal gently with the stranger from afar.’ ”
* * •
Dr. Morrison’s experience only confirms
what is, for those who cave to know it, a well-
known fact— that is, that in every part of the
vast empire of China a foreigner is at least as
safe as a Chinaman is in, say, Australia or
America —if only he will refrain from needlessly
irritating native beliefs and prejudices. Sup-
pose a Chinese missionary came to Australia,
collected an audience, and declared to them that
their fathers and mothers were in hell, that the
head of their religion was in h 11, and that if
they did not at once abjure all their old beliefs
and espouse his new one they would infallibly
go to hell, too. How would that missionary be
likely to fare if his audience, for example, was
composed of ardent Wesleyans with a sprink-
ling of hard-shell Baptists and Salvationists ?
Would he escape with a sound hone in his
body? Yet some European missionaries in
China are guilty of an exactly similar outrage
on native feelings—intensified by the fact that
the Chinaman invests his parents with a sacred
character hardly intelligible by foreigners. Dr.
Morrison quotes B. Broomhall, secretary of
the China Inland Mission :
The millions of Chinese (who have never heard the
Gospel), what is to be their condition beyond the grave?
Oh, tremendous question 1 It is an awful thing to con-
template—hut they perish ; that is what God says.—
“ Evangelisation of the World," p. 70.
* # *
“Ancestral worship,” says Dr. Morrison,
“ is the keystone of the religion of the Chinese ;
‘ the keystone also of China’s social fabric.’
And 1 the worship springs,’ says Rev. W. A. P.
Martin, D. 1)., LL.D., of the Tung Wen Col-
lege, Peking, ‘ from some of the best principles
of human nature. The first conception of a life
beyond the grave was, it is thought, suggested
by a desire to commune with deceased parents.’
(‘ The Worship of Ancestors—a plea for tolera-
tion.’) But Dr. Hudson Taylor, the distin-
guished ..founder, of the -ChinaMnlund; Mission,
condemned bitterly this plea for toleration.
‘ Ancestral worship,’ he said at the Shanghai
Missionary Conference of May, 1890, ‘ is idola-
try from beginning to end, the whole of it and
everything connected with it.’ China’s religion
is idolatry, the Chinese are universally idola-
trous, and the fate that befalls idolaters is care-
fully pointed out by Dr. Taylor —‘ Their part
is in the lake of fire.’ ”
# * *
Yet people wonder that the Chinese refuse
the consolations which a belief that their friends
and relations are burning in hell-fire is so
eminently calculated to bestow ! The faith of
the missionaries (whom Dr. Morrison invari-
ably found occupying the most comfortable
houses in every town, but chiefly collected
round the treaty ports, where there is no risk
and plenty of pleasant society) is an astounding
thing to contemplate. Says Dr. Morrison :
Dining the time 1 was in China I met large numbers of
missionaries of all classes, in many, cities from Peking to
Canton, and they unanimously expressed satisfaction at
the progress they are making in China. Expressed
succinctly, their harvest may he descrihtdas amounting
to a fraction more than two Chinamen per missionary per
annum. If, however, the paid ordaimd and unordained
native helpers be added to the number of missionaries,
you find that the aggregate body converts nine tenths
of a Chinaman, per worker per annum ; but the mission-
aries deprecate their work being judged by statistics.
There are 1511 Protestant missionaries laboring in the
Empire; and, estimating their results from the statistics
of previous years as published in the Chinese Recorder,
«e find that they gathered last year (1893) into the fold
8127 Chinese—not all of whom it is fear dare genuine
Christians —at a cost of £350,000, a sum equal to the com-
bined incomes of the ten chief London hospitals.
Niue-tenths of a Chinaman per annum for
every worker in the vineyard ! At that rate,
supposing the numbers of Chinese and mission-
aries to remain stationary, the whole Chinese
nation (barring the few thousand millions who
die before the glad tidings have a chance of
reaching them) will be more or less converted
in exactly 100,000 years. Glorious prospect!
• • #
Consider the amazing variety of hunters for
Chinese soul-scalps. At Hankow (where “every
visitor is pleased to find that his preconceived
notions as to the hardships and discomforts of
the open-port missionary in China are entirely
false”) the Chinaman who clings to the religion
of his ancestors has to dodge missionaries of
the following denominations ;
London Missionary Society ; Tract Society; Local Tract
Society ; British and Foreign Bible Society; National
Bible Society of Scotland ; American Bible Society ;
private Quaker, Baptist, Wesleyan, and Independent mis-
sionaries; Church Missionary Society; American Board
of Missions ; American High Church Episcopal Mission ;
French Mission ; Franciscan Mission (Italian) ; Augustine
Mission (Spanish); Scandinavian Mission; Danish Mis-
sion ; and China Inland Mission.
These all preach more or less different brands
of gospel; and each, for the Chinaman, repre-
sents the emissary of a different god. And yet
the nett result for all emissaries of all gods is
only nine-tenths of a convert per emissary per
annum ! Blind, ignorant, besotted China ! A
little further inland, at Wanhsien, there is a
branch of the China Inland Mission, established
since 1887.
There are, unfortunately, no converts, but there are
three hopeful “enquirers,” whose conversion would be
the more speedy the more likely they were to obtain
employment ufeerwards. They argue"m this way; they
say, to quote the words used by Ihe Rev. G. L. Mason, at
the Shanghai Missionary Conference of 1890, “if the
foreign teacher will lake care of our bodies we will do him
the favor to seek the salvation of our souls.” “ The idea
is universally prevalent in China,” says the Rev, C. VV.
Mateer, “ that everyone who enters any sect should live
by it. . . When a Chinaman becomes a Christian he
expects to live by his Christianity.”
Hence the numerous breed of “Rice Christians,”
to which probably 99 per cent, of all Chinese
converts belong. They are those who, in the
Chinese vernacular, “love Jesus because they
eat Jesus’ rice.” Those who have rice of then-
own stay outside the fold and make sarcastic
remarks about the shepherds. Of one of the
threp Wanhsien missionaries who have preached
the Gospel with such success that they have
gained no converts in six years (The Bulletin
hopes it isn’t the one from Sydney), Dr. Mor-
rison remarks that nearly all the Chinese in
Wanhsien have heard his doctrine described
with greater or less unintelligibility, and it is
at their own risk if they still refuse to be
saved. The method of this particular soul-
catcher has been pleasantly likened by the
Chinese to that of “a blind fowl picking for
worms.” Brutal, debased China !
* * «
And this is the picture of Chinese mission
work which recurs in Dr. Morrison’s book
with dismal iteration. At Suifu—
There is an enthusiastic young missionary who in
formerly a French polisher in Hereford. He is helped bv
an amiable wife and by a charming English girl scarcely
out of her teens. The missionary’s work has, he tells me,
been “abundantly blessed he has baptised six converts
in three years.
Members of the China Inland Mission—
Six months after their arrival write to China’s Millions :
“ Now for the news ! Glorious news this time ! Ours i-
vices crowded! Such bright, intelligent faces! Si
eager to hear the good news! They seemed to drink in
every word, and to listen as if they were afraid that a
word might be lost.” Five years later they write: "T .e
first convert in Siao Wong Miao was a young mar


named Tbnglkping, a mat-seller. He was very earnest in
his efforts to spread the Gospel, but about the beginning
. tlie vear he became insane. The poor man lost his
reason, but not his piety. "-China's Millions, iv., 5, 95
and 143.
At Yunnan the mission is
Conducted by Mr. and Mrs. X., assisted by Mr. Gra-
ham and by two exceedingly nice young girls, one of
whom comes from Melbourne. . . . After Mr. X. has
labored here nearly six years, he has no male converts,
though there are two promising nibblers. . . . There
was a convert, baptised before Mr. X. came here, a poor
manure-coolie, who was employed by the mission as an
evangelist in a small way ; but “ Satan tempted him, he
fell from grace, and had to be expelled for stealing the
children’s buttons.” It was a sad trial to the mission.
The men refuse to be saved, recalcitrant sinners ! but the
women happily are more tractable. Mr. X. has up to
date (May, ’94) baptised his children’s nurse-girl, the
“native helper” of the single ladies, and his wife’s cook.
Three “rice Christians” for six years’ work!
Obstinate China ! In the whole of the pro-
vince of Yunnan are 18 Protestant missionaries,
who have opened since ’Bl five stations, and
have altogether achieved 11 converts. Says
Dr. Morrison :
The problem is this: In a population of from five to
seven millions of friendly and peaceable people, 18 mis-
sionaries in eight years (the average time during which
the mission stations have been opened) have converted 11
Chinese: how long, then, will it take to convert the re-
mainder?
And the missionaries echo, “How long, O
Lord, how long ? ”
* * *
These are samples of the facts and statistics
with which Dr. Morrison’s book bristles. And
he is only one of the innumerable cloud of wit-
nesses who make it clear that the British Bible,
like British opium, is thrust upon the Chinese
at the point of the bayonet; that the chief
result of missionary work in China is the pro-
vision of a comfortable living for the treaty-
port shepherds—only the women and zealots
going to take risks inland ; that the other
results are the debasement of a few Chinese, the
occasional massacre of a missionary or two, and
the subsequent massacre of many Chinese to
glut the revenge of the followers of Him who
said : “ Lord, forgive them ; they know not
what they do ; ” and that the whole business is
the natural harvest of a diseased fanaticism,
which now, as in all ages, is never content till
the sacrifices to its idol are soaked in human
blood.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Advance Westralia!
In the West, last month, the cause of Austra-
lasian progress achieved, almost unnoticed, a
signal triumph.. Every province but Westralia
had practically decreed a divorce between State
and Church, and now Westralia comes into line.
The circumstances give remarkable illustration
of the power of public opinion over public men.
Agitation for theabolitionof denominational edu-
cation in Westralia commenced two years ago,
but it gathered weight like a rolling snowball.
Bitterly the hoary old Conservatives, the Rip Van
Winkles of the continent, who cluster most
thickly on the western seaboard, fought against
it in pulpit and press, on platform and hust-
ings. Fiercely it was opposed by the unscru-
pulous Forrest Govt., the despotic nepotists
who have cemented blood and bigotry into the
strongest partisan alliance in Australasian
politics. But with the advent of responsible
government came a widening of the fran-
chise which let the light into many a
mouldy political sepulchre, and rattled
the bones of the old Tories as those
venerable relics had never been rattled before.
The gold discoveries at Coolgardie and the
Murchison brought over a swarm of the hated
“ t’other-siders,” hot-foot in chase of the magic
metal, brimful of eastern energy and eastern
ideas. The transformation was as sudden as
that which the stream of Californian gold-
seekers wrought on the sleepy “pure merinoes ”
who peopled N.S. Wales and Victoria in the
fifties. Westralia woke up. And, as soon
as Democracy found articulate voice, it
began to repeat the truisms familiar “on
the other side ” that the State, sup-
ported by the contributions of all the tax-
payers, should not devote those contributions
to spreading the religious opinions of any par-
ticular body of taxpayers; that it was the
State’s business to fit its children to become
good citizens on earth, but not to train them to
be good angels in heaven ; that State patronage
of religious schools poisoned the fount of
citizenship at the springs, and commenced
in childhood a strife which would embitter
maturity. During every recent session of
Parliament the question of abolishing
State aid to denominational schools has
been discussed, and always with increasing
vigor on the part of the democrats, with
iitriinishing opposition on the part of the
sectarians. Late in July the crisis came. A
lirect want of confidence motion was levelled
igainst the Govt., and the Govt.’s heart failed
it. “Don’t shoot, Colonel,” said John For-
rest—and came down. The Qovt. gave an
unconditional guarantee that the denomina-
tional system should be ended ; and the motion
was withdrawn. The rest is only a matter of
time.
“ Stiffening ” the Tote.
A bill to legalise the totalisator has been
utterly rejected by the Victorian Assembly
under circumstances which, to every well-
informed member of the racing world, appear
scandalous. The Bill in question was no new
scheme of turf improvement. Born in Maori-
land, and afterwards adopted by South Aus-
tralia, it made a preliminary appeal to the
honest intelligence of the Victorian Assembly
exactly three years ago, when it passed a third
reading by 31 votes to 24. Up to that time the
local bookmakers had seen no cause for alarm,
and their power to bend the high court of Par-
liament to their will was not exercised in any
degree worth mentioning. A steady decline in
gate-money receipts during the next two years
brought the totalisator question into notice by
V.R.C. committeemen and others interested in
restoring the ancient fortunes of racing-clubs.
Conservative stewards began to partially re-
cognise three facts, now that they could no
loneer afford to ignore the real state of affairs.
“ In and out ” running of horses was killing the
sport; these fatal malpractices were mainly
brought about by bookmakers ; the introduc-
tion of the tote would go far towards killing
the “ hooks,” and put new life into the rescued
sport. The big racing-club managers had not yet
decided to throw over their old friend, who may
here be generically alluded to as Ikey
Mo, but they showed symptoms of a new regard
for the tote. Whereupon Ikey made himself
busy among the senators. In July, 1894, the
Tote Bill was quietly pitched out of the Assem-
bly by 28 votes to 16. Gate-money receipts
dropped more and more, stakes fell in value
accordingly, and racing was degenerating into a
second-class sport. The members of the V. R.C.
desired their committee to take a vote upon the
now burning question of a legalised totalisator,
and the committee held up their bands with an
overwhelming majority. This happened quite
recently. Meanwhile Ikey Moses and Co. had
made arrangements to corrupt every portion of
the senate open to corruption, either by cash
down, the cancelling of hook-debts, or other-
wise. A month ago, before the Lower House
had been properly surveyed, Ikey Mo feared
that he would fail to prevent Murray’s
Bill from reaching the Council. It was on the
Council that Ikey fixed his sinister eye, and
prepared to shed his specie. But a month is a
long time in Victorian politics. Ere the Tote
Bill was offered to the Assembly, its fate under-
went a terrible change for the worse. Ikey
Mo “stiffened” it. In his pardonable exulta-
tion, he must have got slightly unsober. His
tongue was loosened. The news that the Tote
Bill had been “got at” travelled around the
inner circle of sporting Melbourne, and tight-
trousered philosophers, with straws in their
mouths, remarked that “ the books deserved
the win, for they worked very ’ard for it ”
although the tote debate had not been broached
at the time. The present Vic. Assembly con-
tains 23 members who voted for the tote in days
of yore and 25 who voted against it. In the
ordinary course of things those 23 old supporters
of the machine would have swollen to at least
50 last week. Many false arguments, such as
the venerable lie that all horseowners and
trainers hold totes in abomination, are no longer
available, although they formed the back-bone
of Ikey-Moism three years ago. Some of the
25 old opponents of rational betting legislation
know more of their subject than they knew
last time, and among the 47 members who
hadn’t voted either way there must be a fair
percentage of feeling growing feeling in
favor of the tote. About 62 members rolled up
to decide the fate of Ikey Mo.’s betenoir last
week—the biggest muster on record ! When
the father of the Tote Bill called for a
division he found himself with twelve sup-
porters and “about 50 ” opponents, so he “with-
drew his demand for a division,” and Ikey Mo
had “a walkover.” This is a disgusting incident
to reflect upon, but not more disgusting than
other incidents relating to gambling that have
happened in the Vic. Assembly within modern
times. Anyway, Ikey Mo’s victory was not
accomplished until J. B. Patterson had swal-
lowed a pill. Patterson is one of those wdio
support Ikey on the ground that betting ought
to be discouraged and “ put down” to a great
extent. Scott, M.L.A., pointed out that the
aforesaid Patterson steadfastly declined to
put down certain financial gamblers when he
had the chance, and was the protector of two
classes of men who prey upon the public. It
was a very timely attack. Three brands of
legislators vote for Ikey Mo. The respectable
old hands who defend all bad institutions on
principle, the pious men who follow their un-
enlightened consciences in such matters, and
the patriots whom Ikey “stiffens.”
Bogus Socialism.
State Socialism has one cloven hoof and one
sound one, and the cloven hoof was thrust out
prominently in Sydney the other day. Gener-
ally speaking, State Socialism may be defined
as a mean between the objectionable system of
individualism, which permits everybody to do
what is right in his own eyes and cordially
agrees to the devil collaring the hindmost, and
the equally objectionable system of absolute
collectivism, which would leave nobody any
personal freedom at all, but would sort
all citizens into companies and regiments
drilled, under severe penalties, to do the
bidding of a bureaucracy. The Bulletin
believes in State Socialism, because it believes
that, under the present constitution of society,
there are many things which can be better done
by the community, acting for all its members,
than by every individual acting for himself.
No community can exist without inter-
fering with the liberty of its members
to some extent, and it often has to
interfere to a very great extent, despite the
shrieks of many who are revered as the most
upright pillars which any Church can obtain.
John Bright, for example, could never be
brought to see that the State had any busi-
ness to say that children employed in his
factories should not work 16 hours a day ; and
John Bright spelt conscience with a large C,
and peace with a large P, and in many ways
posed as a first-class philanthropic patriot.
But the British nation didn’t happen to agree
with John Bright, and the Factory Acts duly
became law. On the other hand, when the
Paris Commune started out to nationalise the
other fellow’s dining-room furniture, and wood
and coal, and six-roomed cottages, the French
nation seriously objected, and the Commune
was promptly suppressed. So that it is plain
that national sentiment does not always agree
with individual sentiment as to whether State
Socialism is going too far, or not far enough.
Quite possibly the steps which it takes
at one time, or in one set of circumstances,
may appear utterly wrong to public opinion
expressed at another time, or in another
set of circumstances. Public opinion in Aus-
tralia seems, on the whole, satisfied that
the Post-office and the railways and a few
other things should be run by the State;
and The Bulletin is trying to make people
see that a State Bank, and State Life In-
surance, and a State Grog Department,
and two or three similar incursions into the
domain of “ private enterprise,” would also be
to their advantage. But every socialistic in-
stitution must stand and deliver an answer to
the question : Are its operations in the public
■interest? Now, Sydney Post-office, following
the example of State post-offices all the world
over, has just secured damages from a privately-
owned express-company for interfering with
its monopoly by carrying letters from one
city address direct to another for a fee
of sixpence. There is no doubt that the public
want letters so carried ; no doubt that the Post-
office supplies no facilities for carrying them.
The Post-office bureaucrats, therefore, say in
effect to the public: “Your interests conflict
with our regulations, therefore your interests
must give way. You are created for our
benefit : not we for yours. And as you have
been fools enough to make it criminal for any
man to give another man money to carry a
letter for him, you shall be punished accord-
ingly.” Which is a neat reduction to absurdity
of the socialistic dogma.
There are few human exhibitions more hideous
than those of the alleged “reformed sinners”
who mount moral platforms in order to adver-
tise present purity by contrast with former
depravity. The ex-profligate, or burglar, or
confidence-man, who screams about his un-
savory past, wears the offhand aspect of still
hungering after the fleshpots of uncleanness.
Real repentant shame would hide its past from
all unnecessary advertisement. The three re-
deemed gamblers—an ex-bcokie, an ex-jockey,
and an ex-toteclerk—who gave zest to a so-called
anti-gambling demonstration in Sydney on a
recent Sunday, proved no more against gamb-
ling than could be proved against the use of
wine and other stimulants, as distinguished
from abuse. Everybody who plans his conduct
one instant in advance gambles for that in-
stant with eternity—inasmuch as he risks the
present moment, the only dead certainty, against
one in the future which it is any odds from the
infinitesimal to the infinite may (for him) never
arrive. And the churchmen who condemn
gambling are the worst gamblers of all, for
they hand over all this world’s pleasures in cash
to an almighty bookmaker, on His alleged credit
note guaranteeing eternal happiness if they can
win the race to Heaven—in which, on their own
showing, the odds are millions to one against
them.
Confucianism, Buddhism, and other forms of belief,
have set up in their centres of influence religious cancers,
the paralysis of caste, and polygamy ; but the gospel of
Christianity has produced health and nothing but health,
has brought on no paralysis, not even discolored the com-
plexion or dimmed the eyes of any- State, community, or
individual that has carried it into practice.— Rev. Joseph
Cook.
A mere begging of the question ; because, not
one State, not one community, and not one
individual, except Christ Himself, has ever
carried the Gospel of Christianity into prac-
tice. The cant of Cook and others that
usurp the name of Christians ignores the
very essence, of their alleged creed,
and, while mouthing, repudiates by hourly
action the “ Sermon on the Mount.” Alleged
Christianity has upheld, and in places still
upholds, “the Divine right of Kings” and a
“ privileged aristocracy ’’—which is caste.
Alleged Christianity everywhere bows down
and worships the moneyocracy—which is also
caste. Alleged Christianity charges pew-rents
—the worst form of caste. Even Joe Cook
preaches the “ glorious Gospel ” for hard.cash
and charges money at the door. Alleged Chris-
tianity exalts the godly brewer and the pious
distiller, and breeds drunkenness. Mahommed-
auism scores a record there. As to polygamy,
if polygamy is a cancer, monogamy is too often
a brutally slow torture and final murder.
Alleged Christianity has pretended to abolish
slavery, but it holds human flesh and blood to
be a mere chattel of the rich : alleged Chris-
tianity swears by “ freedom of contract ” under
compulsion—a paradox in term, but the worst
sort of slavery in fact.
Dear Bulletin,— “ What may happen to a
man in Victoria.” I am arrested on a charge,
the truth of which I deny, and am remanded
from week to week while the police scour the
province, and use the immense resources at
their disposal to obtain evidence against me ;
me—a single individual who am all this while
locked up, allowed to see a visitor (satisfactory
to the gaol governor) twice a week, and per-
mitted to write two letters per week (ditto,
ditto). I must get up at certain hours and go
to bed ditto (6 a.m. to 4 p.m. ! in winter) must
wash myself daily once only, in second-hand
water, and stop in a very small yard all
day doing nothing. I may not smoke ; I must,
on no account, see any newspapers, nor am I
allowed to have even the solace—if such it be
—of the religious magazines allowed to con-
victed prisoners. 1 am allowed to have my
meals sent in from outside provided I do so
from the first; should I take hominy even once,
through ignorance or inability to make arrange-
ments in time, then it is hominy to the end.
The food sent in is overhauled by a “ searcher”
—not a warder, but a “billeted” prisoner—and
—well, good care is taken by him that I shall
not grow fat from overfeeding. I am not even
allowed to have a bath, no matter how long I
may be under remand (or committal), without
asking the governor for it at the usual morning
“inspection.” And, finally, should I eventually
be convicted, not one hour of the time spent
under remand counts in the sentence, which
begins only with the first day of the Sessions at
which one is convicted. To take a so far innocent
man from every-day life and straightway shut
him up day and night without papers, books,
tobacco, and very often without even the society
of another or others similarly situated, seems
to trie to be a first-class plan of breaking a man
down physically and mentally—whifch is ap-
parently what the authorities desire.— British
Injustice.
—
One of these days the Victorian worker may
ask John Hancock, M.L.A., for reasons why
he objects to the tote, and is even recognised as
a leading champion of Ikey Mo. If Hancock’s
constituents were grand-standers at Fleming-
ton, which they are not, they would pretty
often find John prowling round the betting-
ring in search of political wisdom. So it isn’t
on religious grounds that the vehement repub-
lican opposes machine betting. The writer
has once or twice’ seen him holding
what looked like a council of war pre-
vious to backing a horse with a bookmaker
for the next race, and he shouldn’t need tell-
ing that the tote would lay longer odds.
Furthermore, he can’t cherish much natural
love and affection for Ikey, who starves
the prices, or else he wouldn’t be a friend
of the poor and oppressed. But, stay !
The employment of as much labor as pos-
sible at the highest possible rates is Han-
cock’s worthy aim. The tote would throw a
lot of Ikey Mo. out of employment, and the
balance of that toiling Hebrew identity would
be indirectly “ sweated ” by the machine.
Therefore, Hancock is consistent in opposing
the cupidity of Ikey’s employer, the Public.
He will probably organise a bookmakers’ trade-
union, and next 21st of April, perhaps, John
will be seen mounted on a stiffened steed at the
head of a band of bloated proteges, bearing a
little banner inscribed “ A Living Wage for the
Wagerer. Back your Choice with the Chosen
Chowser ! ”
A new variety of Protection was proposed in
Vic. Assembly t’other night. The trade in
local fruits is said to suffer from the competi-
tion of nigger-grown bananas and pineapples,
and Levien, M.L.A., asked for a duty of Is.
per bushel upon those toothsome products of
Nature and cheap labor, not so much for
revenue purposes, as in order to work a
patriotic change in the national diet. Some-
how the idea didn’t quite catch on. Tbenwith
couldn’t see that a banana and pineapple tax
would lure the public on to apples, or enlarge
the local labor market, anyway. Also, he sug-
gested that prohibition of fruits not grown
in Victoria might pave the way for an Act
compelling the population to live exclusively
on wheat, for the sake of the country ; like-
wise, he raised the technical objection that
bananas are not imported by the bushel. After
which it occurred to somebody else that a re-
taliatory tax upon Victorian cherries exported
to Bananaland would possibly set up a foreign
prejudice against stone-fruit. The matter then
dropped with a sickening thud, and the Mel-
bourne price of the mail-clad pineapple will
remain as before. It goes without saying that'
Levien, M.L.A., belongs to the anti-Protec-
tiouist persuasion. Anything exceptionally
hopeless in the guise of a protective motion is
bound to come from a Freetrader.
The Rescue, a serious little paper representing
the pious and teetotal interests, and having its
address at the Temperance Hall, Sydney, pub-
lishes a few remarks on “the present crisis.”
An extract:
Social position and title from the Queen downward is
sneered at, and the hereditary chamber of this great
empire, the House of Lords, is threatened with overthrow
by men who ought to know and do know better. The
people are determined to rule. . . . Government by
many is a huge blunder. . . . How can you expect
laws to be made and obeyed by the self-same persons?
. . . Socialism, the hand-maid of atheism, is rampant
in this country and on the continent. It saps the founda-
tion of morality, corrupts individual and corporate con-
science. It ruthlessly tramples on the rights of capital
and class privilege. Socialism never gives; it demands.
It is destructive, never constructive. One broadly-
marked feature of political life is the absence of indepen-
dent thought and action. All political parties are alike
in the eager bid for the solid Labor-vote. A Government
put into power by the popular will is one of inherent
weakness ; and its tenure of office being dependent on the
capricious will of the people must necessarily be a brief
one.
And yet in almost every country where the
people govern Mr. Ardill, of the Rescue, can
whoop to his heart’s content in perfect safety,
while in China, where the horrible experiment
of popular Government has never been heard
of, he would probably be clawed into small
pieces, and in Turkey he might be swamped in
some Armenian massacre, and in Russia he
would quite possibly be sent to Siberia. Why
doesn’t Mr. Ardill go and live under one of
these beautiful despotisms ?
If there is ordinary meaning to be attached to
common English, and if the daily-paper report
is a fair one, then the solemn argument of Rev.
J. I). Langley, a recently-promoted Anglican
archdeacon in Sydney, and that of Congrega-
lionalist parson Dunstan, is that God answered
Card. Moran’s Romish “foul aspersion ” on
Protestant foreign missions, in respect of their
“ comfort and comparative luxury,” by inspir-
ing the savage hearts of the Chinese to butcher
the Protestant missionaries ! Strip this state-
ment naked, and behold a stupendous and
blasphemous libel, made as by a privileged
confidant, on the Christians’ Almighty God.
Further analysed, the archdeacon’s argument
stands as a monumental illustration of the
fanatical fact that nothing is too harrowing,
nothing too hallowed, to be used as a merciless-
bludgeon on the head of a sectarian rival, even
though that rival.be a brother-worshipper of
the same Christ. If Card. Moran wants tc
“heap coals of fire on the heads” of his
theological enemies, he should send an ex
cathedra message of sympathy and condolence
to the bereaved Protestant missionary societies.
The humor of tragedies !
“ The defendant has been using the letters
L.R.C.P. after his name without being legally
entitled to do so ? ” asked a Lpndon magistrate
lately. “ Fined .£2O, with £lO 10s. costs, or
one month’s imprisonment.” Instead of strain-
ing after the unattainable or vexatiously de-
batable, N.S.W. Parliament should, when it
next takes up the question of quack regulation,
go for a short, straight bill, giving stipendiary
magistrates powers like the above. The man who
attaches to his name letters signifying that he is
what he isn’t, has no arguablp defence for his mis-
representation, and five minutes of Parliament’s
time should be ample for his suppression. He has
escaped so far, not because he has attempted
any defence, but because those who undertook
to legislatively suppress him persistently ex-
ceeded the scope of public requirement. They
wanted to extend a monopolistic influence or
otherwise aggrandise a constituted medical
guild at the same time that they assisted the
public to crush imposture, and the public has
in effect said, over and over again, that it
would rather the imposture should continue
than that these other ends should be attained.
It is threatened that, should the N,S. W,
land-tax pass, one of the immediate effects will
be a general reduction of the wages of station-
hands.

Wm. Elton and “The Guv’nor” continue to

at Sydney Criterion, and the cantankerous ex-
pression on the mahogany visage of the deaf old

f ether different to the amiable smile of plain \V,
Jiton, comedian, as he-spins a bicycle down Pitt-
street o’ mornings with a straw hat hooked on to
his bump of philoprogenitiveness. “The Guv’nor”
plays more smartly now than it did on its swear-
ing-in ; the more or ornamental members of
the co. display more alacrity in getting out of
Westmacott’s way when ho spurts for the wings
with his stutter in full blast; and the long,
spidery, water-side character in a blue jersey is
more punctual in colliding with the heir of the

collision novy takes place in full view of the
audience, which formerly only heard the bump.
Miss Harrie Ireland (whose method strongly sug-
gests Miss Myra Kemble here and there) still
makes melodrama of her light comedy part ;
while Miss Madge Corcoran, on the other
hand, takes to the boards as timidly as a
oat to soapsuds— custom never seems to assure
this trim young lady of the fact that the
audience has not assembled for the express
purpose of eating her. But everybody is
well-placed in the “Guv'nor”—barring a long,
strange youth who wanders through the rattling
farce handicapped by an over-balancing moustache
and the depressing stage-name of “Bindloss.”

In “ The World Against Her ” Maud
Williamson holds feminine emotions in the hollow
of her little hand, judging by the generous display
of ’ankercbers in the family-circle when Madge
Carlton grabs her little Annie (clever little .Marie
Lohr) from one of the several bold bad men, and
dares them to part a mother from her che-yild.
Miss Williamson's forcible, though reserved, style
of acting, aided by her fine eyes and shapely figure,
carries a decidedly tin-pot domestic tragedy to a
successful conclusion. But in emotional rdles of
this brand Miss Williamson’s name is a guarantee
that no deep sob marked in the business will be
omitted by the leading woman, and that strict
attention will be paid to all the agony piled on by
the author. Scot luglis, as the villain, got npa /a
Henry Irving, omits neither eye-glass, evening
dress, the use of the word “damn,” nor cigar-
ette to make his wickedness convincing, though
his habit of grinding his teeth gives him°a
toothaohey appearance now and then. A
word of praise must be levelled at Mr. Leighton,
whose dude collar burst from its moorings oil
Monday night, at the critical moment when Miss
Claudius, in a dreamy confection like cabbages
veiled in coal-smoke, was leaning her ear on his
vest. But Mr. Leighton let the collar go, and
hugged the lady in the most natural manner in
the world. The weakest spot in “The World
Against Her ” was Mr. H. Plimmer, as the hero.
Mr. P. will never look like a grnwn-up man while
he oontinuesto pull such cry-baby faces, “Joseph
of Canaan” goes up to-night (Saturday), with
George Rignold as Joseph and Maud Williamson
as Mrs. Potiphar. This sounds most promising,
only that a managerial programme-foot-note rather
destroys the bouquet. “The Biblical foundation
of the play,” says the management, “cannot offend
the most scrupulous,” In which case it surely
can’t be an unabridged translation.

The Countess Waclitmeister, Mrs. Besant's
theosopbical understudy, has arrived in Sydney to
expound the gospel of the marvellous Mahatma,
who is so wise, and so pure, and so noble, that he
has to pass all his days in sad soliloquy on a Hima-
layan peak, for fear the skirts of his mystic gar-
ment would be contaminated if he came down
and jostled elbows with the wretched ruck of
humanity. Ihe Countess, a forlorn lady whose
utter abandonment to “ the Cause ” seem to have
washed out all the distinctive characteristics
the ever possessed, rather glides over the
Mahatma, especially the Judge brand of the
article, and confines herself to wandering
vaguely round among the mazes of theo-
sophical doctrine, and exhorting people to look
for the Bath, and choose the Way, and seek the
Bight, and generally let their benevolence ooze
out as much as ever it wants to. There is a bland,
soothing influence about the Countess's person-
ality that deprives one of the power of criti-
cising her capacity too severely, and if she
could be pounded up into small fragments and
boiled down to Extract of Wachtmeister, this
paper would willingly buy a small bottle as an
anodyne for its weary nerves,

The Tivoli’s novelty this week is a little
act entitled “After the Ball,” in which Miss
Kate Girard raises her foot and kicks a hat held
a very great distance above tier head, while
Mr. Emile Girard turns somersaults of admira-
tion for pure love of her. Evidently the ball-
supper was a very good one. The rest of the
show remains very much \\ here it was, only it
has glued itself down there even more deter-
minedly, and hammered several large tucks into
itself to keep itself from coining off.

At the Empire, the Mayfield sisters have
surrounded themselves with many thousand
yards of muslin, in which they play hide and
seek at intervals with great dexterity. The
remainder of the show is thrown into some
amount of temporary shade by these agile
apparitions, but the sweetly tuneful voice of
Miss Ada Colley pierces that shade with much
vigor.

If the “ memory-scientist,” Professor
Loisette, didn’t possess such a large number
of apparently convincing testimonials, Tmk
Bulletin would be disposed to set him down
as a very ordinary kind of itinerant Yankee
showman with nostrums of uncertain saving
power. As this paper hasn’t paid ,£5 ss. fur
the privilege of entering the Loisette holy of
holies, it can only express the opinion that
the outer tabernacle (admission, 25.) is stuffed
with witless jokes, stale pseudo-science, and an
exceedingly large number of dull and yellow
platitudes. Consequently, The Bulletin
has determined with much regret that when
it has saved up ,£5 ss. it will give not one
penny of it to Prof. Loisette on the off-chance
of being enabled to remember many things which
it wants badly to forget, but will buy “Stokes on
Memory ” fur a shilling and devote the balance to
the purchase of admission-tickets fur newer shows,
with a sufficient variety of legs in them to be
recollected without the least trouble.

The ill success of the B. and B. season at
Melb. Princess’ is partly chargeable to manager
Boucicault s method of employing Ids forces.
Miss Olliffe has, without a doubt, made herself a
special object of interest for the public, yet, in six
out of nine pieces produced during eleven weeks,
slie played either a minor part, or, more often,
didn’t appear at all. “Sowing the Wind ” offered
a favorable opportunity for displaying that strong,
magnetic, picturesque actress, but the part so well
adapted to her was given to the other lady,
Miss Falier. People wanted to see Miss Olliffe as
“ The Second Mrs. Tanqileray ’’—the certainty of
brisk demand for Pinero's masterpiece was ap-
parent long before the event, but when at last the
success of the season put in an appearance it
was restricted to a four nights’ run. “Johu-k-
Dreams ’ might not have proved such a very dire
failure if Miss Olliffe hail taken Miss Faber’s com-
manding place, instead of being left to assert her
ability in a very light-comedy character. The
managerial policy with regard to the Olliffe-
brauch of the business has a decidedly wavering
appearance. If it was good enough to engage an
able and fascinating leading lady to till Mrs.
Brough’s shoes for awhile, it should be good
enough to run her for all she is worth.

Musical Melbourne, which lay torpid for
years after swallowing the Halle entertainments,
sh >ws a disposition to consume some more masses
of food. On Saturday afternoon, Herr Johann
Kruse, lately back from Europe with a reputa-
tion, was announced to make a last appearance in
his native city, and his native city rushed the
Town Halj in order to catch a glimpse of its long-
lost offspring's reputation before he went. The
concert was a good concert in the same sense that
the Koran is a good book. Herr Kruse, unexcep-
tional, although not a marvellous, violinist, was
supported by that brilliant, non-severe piano
artist. Signor de Beanpuis. Also, the performance
of the audience in pretending to enjoy themselves
immensely was not less worthy of praise than the
efforts of Marshall Hall’s orchestra, in the back-
ground. The Krentzer Sonata for violin and
piano was the biggest tiling on the programme.
This was preluded by a silent procession of Mar-
shall Hall to a side gallery, where the professor
sat apart front the other men, with his back to the
wall, discovering new depths of meaning in each
note. The exact circumference of this item was
40m in.

Beethoven’s “Kreutzcr" is a comparatively
giddy piece of great-master music—a novelette, so
to i-peak. About 20 minutes of it are devoted to
introductory matter, or dry, irrelevant details,
which, in a written story, would be skipped by
the reader. The rest of the story is often delight-
ful. A strong imagination might almost picture
Edwin and Angelina looked in one another’s hug
when the music ceases. Neither Kruse nor De
Beanpuis had seemed quite at home with the
sonata, but they were vociferously applauded
until they took an encore. They is no skipping
the makeweight portions of a sonata, or violin
concerto. Saturday’s programme had to be sat out,
tlm Town Hall seats are hard and unsympathetic,
and popular enthusiasm was exhausted ere the
finish. A solo I»y Herr Kruse was the last num-
ber, and aa soon as the demigod of the occasion
had completed his task, the audience made for the
doors without pausing to give him a “hand.’’
The inconsistency of conduct was partly excus-
able. During the afternoon R. S. Smytlie
flooded the Ifall with circulars promising yet
another last Kruse conceit —at greatly reduced
prices. Therefore, the four or five hundred
pound-worth of people present, having paid high
prices for a performance which wasn’t valedictory
at all, felt that R.B.S. owed them something more
than mere gratitude.

A trophy for Kruse was dumped upon the
platform last Saturday at the inopportune moment
that comes between two movements. The trophy
was a withered-looking pot-plant in a wicker
stand, from which hung a gaudy sheet inscribed ;
“ Virginia Bower—Filial Love.” This aw ful
device for reminding the world that family troubles
had brought Kruse over from Germany made the
astonished artist blush, and a professional artist
doesn’t blush easily.

“ A Village Priest,” revived on Saturday
at Melb. Princess’s, will be held up to general
admiration until to-night (Thursday), AhW
Titht-radge is even improving upon his previous
best in this stirring play, whilst the present cast
of characters privileged to bask in the good man's
blessing is not inferior to the casts of other times.
Boucioault, as the convict, and Miss Oil life, as
the penitent lady with |>owdered hair, give new
interest to several old situations, and the famous
miracle grows more impressive every time. “Mrs.

B. and B. season on Friday, when Miss Clliffe,
Miss Noble, and Miss Talbot make a joint and
several farewell appearance in Melbourne.

On Saturday the Firm’s beloved opera co.
returns to the Princess’ for a month’s run.
“Madame Angqt ” is the first of six operas under-

bourne as the daughter of the dead fishwife.

“ Saved from the Sea,” at Melb. Royal,
is one of those awful affairs in which the author
tries to blast the work of the scenic artist and
fails miserably. W. B. Spong has loaded up
Bland Holt’s latest triumph with landscapes such
as no evil influences can fight against: further-
more, there is a rolling deep in the first act which
would keep the leadenest of melodramas afloat.
The ocean stretches from Little Bourke-street to
the footlights, and gets as near to salt-water in
appearance as any reasonable mortal can expect.
Miss Watson and Walter Baker are discovered
breasting its cold, damp, wadding billows by the
light of arising moon until Mr. and Mrs. Bland Holt
come rocking along in a small boat and save them
from being dashed to pieces against a stage box.
The effect of this marine illusion is to diffuse, as
’twere, a smell of seaweed and winkles throughout
the house. Walter Baker, on his way to and fro
the gallows, with the sheriff and a few hangmen
in attendance, is another beautiful scene. As a
rule, the condemned felon doesn't walk hack from
the gallows, hut in Baker’s case the drop refuses
to work, and after the Law has made three abor-
tive attempts to drop him through the floor, he is
sent to Portland and chained to Albert Norman’s
leg. _ Cosgrove figures prominently as a fisherman
of insane habits, hut the third villain is a
feeble creature who carries a new umbrella
and serves as a target for the funny man’s
jokes. “Saved from the Sea,” Thk BULLETIN
regrets to mention, doesn’t teach Thrift to the
gallery. Every night a certain number of ap-
parently real mutton chops are grilled over a real
picnic fire and handed round, hut not one member
of the festive party has thus far been observed to
make a hearty meal, and the chops are probably
mutilated in due course by the stage cat.

The Dacres had a disastrous season at
Adelaide Royal. Comedy never pays in Adelaide;
even B. and B. have to play farcical comedy. The
Adelaide saints like farces with breezy situations
when they can’t get leg opera ; but comedies like
“A Bunch of Violets ” —never !
Presbyterian parson James Milne, M.A.,
gives the champion big order ;
A far >i»> ter and more pleasant result would he achieved
if, through this martyrdom, the European Powers were
led to consider the case of China, ami to establish a Pro-
tectorate (!). which would rule in the interests of justice
and humanity over a country which-was at once too un-
wieldy and too weak to govern itself. Far from such
action hy the Powers leading to military complications,
h* nelieved that a common interest among them would
rather he for the interests of peace.
The “common interest’* among several dogs
tugging at a large and irregular bone is always
“ for the interests of peace 1 ”
Speaking in N.S. VV Log. Assembly, Labor-
leader M'Gowen remarked that the Labor-party
was there to see that Premier Reid, who is now
preaching “moderation,” did not sacrifice prin-
ciple for policy. It might be expedient and judi-
cious for the Premier to go back with regard to
the proposed Land-tax exemptions, but the Labor-
party was not going back. The Premier, tie
added, somewhat misunderstood an incident in
the Labor-party’s history. He had said that four
members of the party were rejected at the previous
elections because they voted for the Dibbs duties.
That was not so. The reason those men were
rejected from the Labor-party was that they did
not vote straight on the Broken Hill matter.

Melb. Arcus, apeing the Times, is bring-

sad tale.
Premier Reid’s appointments to the
N.S.W. Legislative Council were, he would pre-
tend, the olive-branch of eoncdiatiou to that
Chamber. Is this the recent raging, Eyeglasaed
Fury of the Stump? Is the Tornado of the Elec-
tions now blowing zepbyr-soft indeed ?
Splendid coffee is being grown in N.

generally black and yellow labor.
Agreement between a married couple read
in a maintenance-case at Prahran (Vio.) court the

Mutual Consent.—We, the married couple, Bruce Tay-
lor and Mis. Eliza Taylor, do both give our consent to

to live happily together at 7s. per week, both at liberty to

The Argus replaces its Bret Harte story,
just concluded, with a gory, sensational screamer,
by nobody in particular. It is billed in all the
news-agents with cuts of a scrimmage on a steam-
in the agonised presence of a long-haired
heroine, with a detective and the funny-man
watching on the bank. The whole suggests Bland
Holt and looks like the “Argus, with which is
incorporated ‘Deadvvood Dick.’”
“ Ishmael ” Crick, M.P, (N.S.W.), should
remember that the qualifications of a political
leader should not merely include brilliancy,
honesty of purpose, audacity, bulldog tenacity
and gadfly persistency, but also that power of
endurance which enables him to possess his soul
in patience with unshaken faith in his star,
besides that faculty of self-command which can
successfully conceal the irritation of “ a sore
head.” Without these attributes, even political
genius courts political failure.
N.S.W, Premier Reid, who swore to
"‘stick to every line of the land-tax exemptions,”
now shuffles about in search of a compromise. If
ho succeeds, he will have destroyed about his last
claim to democratic favor. His reported inten-
tion of putting the exemption clauses in italics in
the Land-tax Bill, and then making believe they
aren’t there, is so unspeakably mean in the face of
his former protestations that the Upper House
makes uo secret of its contempt for him.
Gospel religion is ludicrously inconsistent.
A female missionary goes rampaging abroad with
an inspired New Testament in her handbag, and
the blessed words of Paul buckling from her
tonguebut when some of Paul’s inspirations
don’t suit her own hook, she puts her tongue in
her cheek and swallows the unsavoury morsels.
Hear apostle P.— Ist Cor. 14th chap, verses 34
and 35, “ Let your women keep silence in the
churches; for it is not permitted unto them to
speak . . . And if they will learn anything, let
them ask their husbands at home; for it is a
shame for women to speak in the church.” Also
Ist lim. 2nd chap, verse 12. “But I suffer not a
woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the
man, but to be in silence.” Practically the female
missionary asserts that inspired Paul was a
narrow-minded bigot who didn’t know any better,
and probably she is quite right. So she preaches
the divine Gospel of Christ, who, when on earth,
loved all the uneducated believers in him, and
simply damned the more cultured listeners who
didn’t believe. The Christianity which awards
hell-fire to every man who calls’another man a
fool, merely because the Pharisees applied that
contemptuous term to the Nazarene; and which
has been cursing generations of Jew “ vipers ” for
the last 1800 years. The Christianity of the
Book ; of the Ajawtles who record their Master’s
promise to comedown from Heaven on clouds and
rule the earth during their lifetime. And unless
the pore heathen believe certain things set forth in
the Book, whilst shutting their eyes and ears and
minds to other things (viz.,the test passages by
which the falsehood of the Book’s pretensions is
revealed) they must follow their fathers to Sheol,
Paul, or no Paul, missionary teaching of that sort
is deplorable in women, as in men.
“Aby” Alfcson’s original picture, “The
Golden Age,” which, under the terms of his
travelling scholarship, he presents to the Vio.
National Gallery, lately arrived. A brilliant—
almost audacious—piece of work, it is placed in
the midst of a score of dull, minor-keyed can-
vases, now utterly useless, for nobody will
bestow even a passing glance upon them wliile
Altson’s bold “ mustard ” conception, as it was
known among his Parisian fellow-students, re-
mains. An oblong picture about Bft. x 4ft., with
a huge irregular splash of yellow over three-fourths
of the whole and adozen smaller pink splashesover
the green remainder, the work at a distance strikes
the spectator ns the chef d'oeuvre of some
artistic lunatic; but few steps forward are needed
to dispel any question of the artist’s sanity.
Five nude female figures are grouped about an
almost nude male figure. One Rossell-like nymph
stands on tip-toe, her arms extended above her
head and her hair flying in the air ; she is in the
midst of some weird, enthralling dance—the
accompaniment being provided by the youthful
flautist in the rear, and a female harpist
on the right. , All are exquisitely drawn
and painted—a trifle under-inodelh d perhaps,
especially the girl on the extreme right-hand of
the picture—and the effect of (notion is conveyed
with ten times the force of the over-rated, over-
paid “Right of Way.” But the great charm
of the picture is its imninousness; the sunlight
falling through the boughs, touching the dancing
nymph on the calf, is real sunlight; its spots on the
grass reflect real warm glows upon the side of the
squatting girl by the male musician. It is a
picture before which the frozen Melbournian can
stand for five minutes and imagine he is back
again at February’s picnics.

A Sydney concert promoter announces a
new idea, which is none the less promising because
it isn’t new at all. The public, he says, are weary
of the old singers and the old songs. Give ’em
sentiment. So he is starting a series of Scotch
evenings, Irish evenings, war-song evenings, sea-
song evenings, and even Australian evenings, in
the Town Hall ; and as the talent is good, the
price of admission (Is.) is low, and arrangements
have been made for smokers, promenaders, and
refreshers, the great soul of the public ought to
catch on.
At Poverty Point.
One of Oscar Wilde’s pungent phrases In “The Import-
ance of Being Earnest" got home, on the first night,
with the directness of a local allusion. “No woman
Should ever marry a man of the name of John," remarked
Bervl Faber, glancing at Melb. Princess’ vice regal box.
The Brough-Boucicault co. undergoes many changes
after the Melb. season. Beryl Faber is the only one of
the last hatch of importations who will stay on: she has
signed for another nine months, and will show again in
Svdney and Melb, Geraldine Olhffe and her husband, with
Mr. Elwood and his wife, the pleasant-looking Miss Talbot,
go ’Owe from Adelaide. The dainty Grace Noble will do
likewise, having put in three years’ useful service. Jenny
Watt-Tanner will take up Miss Talbot’s maternal parts.
Hilda Spong replaces Grace Noble, and Mrs. Brough
resumes her old position vice Miss Olliffe.
Hilda Spong, who Joins B. and B. immediately, has
picked up two or three trying mannerisms since her last
appearance with the premier Australian eo. It will take
Hot B. all he knows to modify the masculine strides she
now makes in her profession ; also, to break her of her
lingual peculiarities—“ It is a fine dee,” “Goo awee," &c.
Hilda is usually a heroine whom any judicious and right-
minded hero must love to gather to the spotless white
front of hjs dress-shirt, an 1 it will he a matter of grave
Australasian concern if D. Boucicault fails to abolish these
spots on the star.
After fire nights of “A Village Priest,’’ at Meih. Prin*
cess’, “Mrs. Tank." goes up again for one night only,
and admirers of both will have a good chance of compar-
ing Grundy and Pinero at close quarters, and at their
best. Mrs. Grundy appreciates the former, but he is
much weighted by ids want of humor. “ A Vill-
age Priest” is only relieved by the inclusion of the Holy
father's housekeeper, and that is not a relief deserving of
much thanks. In “Mrs. Tanqueray ” we have Cayley,
the Orreyds, and the Second Mrs. T. herself, a splendid
composition of light,and shade. In “ Sowing the Wind ”
Grundy is more successful, but the blend is not nearly so
artistic. With Pinero you never discover the soda in the
cake. ,
A cynic in the gallery of Melh. Princess’ theatre, a few
evenings since, at the conclusion of the performance of
•fine Importance of B-ing Eimest,” raised a call for
“author!” Toe cry was taken up by a group who
Beein°d to find some humor in it. The author did not
make his appearance. In fact, if one goes by the pro-
grammes, play-bills, and advertis r ments, the piece never
had an author. It seems, like Topsy, to have simply
“ growed.”
Miss Maggie Sterling, who has about the best mezzo-
soprano voice, meth ai and platform style of (lie singers
lift in Vic., is to take a benefit concert at Melb. Town
Hall shortly. ThJ amiable lady is a very generous
donor of valuable services—she sings so readily for any
sort of charity that every suburb has heard her in its local
hall—and the coming musical rally on her h half ought
to fill the metropolitan building to its draughty doors.
Elizabeth Watson, Bland Holt's latest importation,
lacks her sister’s lithe figure, but is very like her in other
respects. In spots her acting, as the heroine of the latest
cong’omerate horror at Melb. Royal, suggests the pro-
bability of her coming out strong when site is more at
home. Fetching Henrietta did not arrive till long after
landing.
Ere the Gaieties depart, that Thespian ffite might lie
fetched off in Sydney for tire poor mummers.
Bland Holt’s latest importation, like B. &B.’s leading
lady, is married, but retains Iter maiden name. Miss
Watson’s departure for Australia was hurried—she had
only four days’ notice. Her hubby and family remain in
England. , '
George Titheradge’s daughter will shortly d6but with
tire B. & B. 00.
Neat dramatic criticism in Melb. theatrical divorce-
case:—Mr. Woolf: “Is this woman an actress?” Peti-

Dear Bulletin,— l'm a shy man from the hush, hut I
never felt more strongly tempted to make a public oration
than 1 did last night at Sydney Lyceum theatre. When
Louis Hradfield returned to give another verse of “ Her
golden teeth were hanging on a tack,” or something to
that effect, I was only restrained by fear of violence from
shouting; “Mister Bradfield, I came 400 mi leg and paid
6->. to see this show, hut the hediamonded cacklers around
me are so busy assuring each other that they’ve ‘heard
it all b foah,’ that I can’t hear a word from ttie stage,
and as I didn’t come to hear a corrohoree of ‘granny
birds,’ who are evidently moulting, I’ll retire to some
other show.” Some day a few boys from “ out back,” wdio
come to listen and lake back a few fragments of song to
their mates, will arise and make an emphatic protest
against the tiiealre-parlies who come only to hear them-
selves talk. If the present writer ever arrives at ( lie last
Judgment, lie will not he surprised to hear the Lyceum
diess-oircle crowd remarking, in loud, husky tones, that
“Haw! it’s not had, tint we’ve heard it all befoih, don-
oherknow !” But why don’t the entrepreneurs “ take
steps”?— H.H.C.C.
Alfred Dampier is hack again from a 14-months’ tour
through England, Germany, France, and America, look-
ing belter than The Bulletin has ever s-en him look
before. In London lie produced “ Robbery Under Arms ”
for three weeks at the Princess’ with very fair success.
In New York, lie was handsomely paid for “ underwriringa
play ";in ’Frisco lie made a great hit as Valjean in “ Saints
and Sinners ”(“ Les Mis6rahles ”), and a still greater hit
as Hamlet. When in London, Dampier and George Miln
took one another to interview Irving. The great man
said nothing about coming to Australia ; hut the Kendalls
may possibly paralyse this cynical continent next year.
Melba’s singing in “ Lea Huguenots” the traveller found
superb ; but what moat kindled Ins dramatic enthusiasm
was the reverence paid to the immortal William by Ger-
many, “ (he true home of the Shakespearean spirit.” In
Berlin, Dampier saw in one week five of Shakespeare’s
comedies produced—each with perfect detail and unsur-
passable splendour. -
The remains of the popular treasurer of Her Majesty’s
Theatre, Sydney, Mr. J. P. Macdonald, who died in St*
Vinoent’s Hospital on Friday last after a long illness,
were, on Saturday afternoon, interred in Waverley ceme-

handsome wreaths were sent as tributes to (he memory of
one of the most widely-known of Australia’s theatrical
identities.
The Wild - Cat Column .
In Q. Supreme Court the other (lay, the legal
stuffing was knocked out of that fascinating implement
of commerce, the postdated cheque. On March 15 one
Magill gave a cheque payable on April 6. The B.N.Q.
paid it on March 19. Consequently, another clieque given
by Magill on March 16 was dishonored on March 26 for
want of the funds which the post-dated cheque had
absorbed. Magill sued before Judge Cooper and a Towns-
ville jury and got t5O damages. The hank appealed, and
Chief Justice Griffith, Judge Harding and Judge Heal all
decided in its favor. Griffith, J., held that a post-dated
cheque is a hi 11 of exchange payable on demand ; that it
should bear a Is., not a Id. stamp; that its real date is
the date of the tvsue, and the dale on the face is
uolhing. Harding, J., wasn’t sure that a postdated
cheque is a hill of exchange payable on demand ;
but held that if it is presented for payment, and a hank
lias funds to meet it, it cannot refuse to accept the
responsibility of even a future piynvnt, and that when it
accepts the responsibility it is justified in charging (lie
clieque against the drawer’s account straight away. And
Judge Real agreed both with Judge llarding ai d the
Onief Justice.
The lay mind can only marvel at this logic. The
establishment of a. new hanking convention does not very
much matter, so long as it is generally understood. What
the decision amounts to, however, is this. If John Smith
authorises ids hanker in black and white to pay Tom
Jones £6 on f >o c. 1, '96, and hands over the authority to
Jones on S ,»u 1, ’95, it is the bank's privilege, even
its duty, to pay Jones £5 as soon as he likes to
present the cheque. Why, in the name of common
sense an instrument which plainly declares that it isn’t
negotiable before (lie date on its face, should he legally
made negotiable three months before that dale doesn’t
anywhere appear. The common-sense view is that a
post-dated clieque has no negotiable value whatever till
its date arrives. Its authority lies dormant till it
matures, just like that of a promissory-note ; and pend-
ing maturity it lias exactly I lie same commercial value ns
a promissory-note— i.e., it is a promise to pay on a given
date, which may or may not be worthless, and which is
only accepted as a provisional settlement of accounts.
But no bank would venture to hypothecate its client's
funds to pay his promissory-notes before they matured.
And why thelaw. in the case of a post-dated cheque, in-
sists on construing an authority to pay money on a
specified date as an authority to pay it tv fore that, dateis
a puzzle to which even the alleged wisdom of the law can
supply no sensible solution.

Tucker, late chairman of Vic. Tariff Board
deceased, makes three proposals towards freeing Vie.
ports. Tonnage dues (which bring in £lB,oooper annum)
are to he abolished. Pilotage charges, comprising the
present earnings of the pilots, are to he reduced one-
third. Thirdly, vessels entering in ballast ate to lie
charged only half pilotage dues. The pilotage charges
amount to about £5OO per annum for 21 pilots—say,
£ll,OOO every year. It would not lie a grave matter to
take over the pilots and make them Government officials,
and then give their services free to every vessel that
wants them. The tonnage dues are merely lolls, and
tolls on roads hav e long been abandoned by every civilised
community.
Vic. at present is indulging an export policy,
and as long as that is consirt red desirable and advan-
tageous, no hindrance to exportation should be permitted
to exist. Wharfage dues and tonnage dues are a survival
of barbarism—an undesirable impost on desirable trade.
Vie. already penalises certain import* in the interests of
local production. At present Melh. is nn expensive har-
borage—a condition of things favorable to the shipping
ring which is cynically dictating terms to the Vic. Govt,
The alleged “ revenue ” from tonnage dues is in reality
expenditure by the community on a cumbrous system.

One of the Freetrade industries of N.S.W. is
the manufacture of high-class rum, from 60 to 800. p.,
for export to IJingland. The correlative Hinglish indus-
try is to dilute, adulterate, bottle, and export that rum
to N.S.W. as “best Jamaica.” It would never do f.-r
N.S.W. rum distillers to manufacture for the N.S.W.
market , because the excise duly is as heavy as tlie import-
duty. Besides, the present system fattens the bloated
ring of right-thinking Sydney importers, encourages the

There is a steadily-strengthening disposition
among men concerned in the management of the Broken
Hill mines to reconsider the whole question of timbering
the “ big mine.” Curiously enough, Mr. W. R. Wilson,
the very man who was indirectly responsible, for the intro-
duction of the square-set system of litiibeilng with
Oregon, was also 1 lie first to question its perfect suita-
bility ; Hus lie did three years ago, when the creeps in
Block 11 began to give trouble. There is no doubt at. all

Patton) believed that the system would answer without

Despite the flourish of trumpets with which the

The B.H. Proprietary directors, having got
their fire out, are concerned to demonstrate that it was
not such an expensive fire after all. Chairman M’Bryde,
at the half-yearly meeting in Melbourne, was sure the lull
would he under 420,000. The damage— accurate estimate
impossible—is admittedly far less than it might have been,
but 420,000 is, nevertheless, Tue Bulletin is assured,
a ridiculous under-estimate.

The employes of the B.H. Proprietary Co., of
course, had nothing to do with bringing about the late
change of management (writes a correspondent), but
Otherwise the position at tbe mine lends itself to compari-
son with that, pictured in the faille of the frogs and their
kings. Manager Howell was never p'pnlar, hut most of
the employes in the 00. would be delighted could they
have King Stork deposed with great violence, and get
King Log hack again.
At latest they believed they bad smothered the
fire in the Broken’ Hill mine, 'tint were still forcing carbonic
acid gas down into the workings. Broken Hill was
greatly alarmed about the introduction of this gas ; hut,
after all, it was very much diluted, three-fourths of the
whole volume being atmospheric air. The Southern nest
of furnaces on the mines has not been blown in again,
liow r ever; and it is very likely these w ill not be used much
more. Altogether, in fact, unless something quite out of
the way turns up. the days of much smelting at Broken
Hill are quite numbered. Mr. Howell never doubted for
a moment that the sulphides would have to he taken
to the seaboard: and Professor Schnabel dismissed fire-
treatment on the mine as ntisnid. The battle will be
between S.A. and N.S.W. sea-board, with appearances at
present all in favor of the latter.

Dr- Herman Lawrence, the one “new '
man who got elected to the Melbourne Hospita*
staff, was the hero of the first wedding perpetrated
in St. Paul’s (Melb.) Cathedral. Or rather, he
was the heroine's bridegroom. There is no such
thing as a hero at a wedding.
It gives one a nasty shock to find the ghost
of Harrie Smith standing outside the Melbourne
Athenaeum Club, looking for all the world like the
deceased sport revisiting his old haunts. The
apparition is Harrie’s brother. Such family like-
nesses ought not to be allowed.
At the N.S. W. Leg. Council opening Dr.
Garran, one of the three commissioners, wore the
conventional dress-suit, but President Lackey and
Attorney-General “Jack” Want appeared in
knee-breeches, buckles and ruffles. Just think of
it! Jack Want in ruffles !
Barrister Purves’ lecture at Melbourne
Athenseum on “ Bench and Bar ” was, in parts,
of a strong indigo tint. As the ages of the
majority of his auditors ranged from 16 to 23,
their mothers consider that the Q.C. might have
toned down his anecdotes considerably.
The great strength outside Parliament of
Symon, Q.C., leader of the S.A. Conservatives, is
that not a whisper has ever been breathed against
hia personal character. Yet he is not popular, for
there is great faith in the doctrine that “ to err is
human,” and that moral perfection is abnormal.
Ex-Premier Patterson, apropos of the
totalisator-legislation question, warmly denounces

George Coppin, Melb. Theatre Royal,
retires from the Leg. Council next week. George
is 75 years of age, and first entered the Council in
1858. Looking at the old man now it is difficult
to believe that, as a young man, he played Cupid
perfectly at Drury Lane, and was considered to
look the part to perfection,
Monahi Iri, who defended the Kaiapoi
pah against Te Rauparaha, when the latter gentle
assimilator of his race made his memorable in-
vasion of the Middle island of Maoriland, in or
about 1830, died only the other day. Though for
the last 40 years of his life he lived surrounded by
Europeans, he never learned a word of English.
Justice Richmond, of Maoriland Supreme
Court, is dead. He it was who presided at the
memorable trial of sea-captain Jarvie for alleged
poisoning. Ireland, Q.C., was specially brought
from Victoria to defend, and Dr. Macadam, the
Vic. Govt, analyst, gave professional evidence in
the case. The prisoner was convicted and hanged.
The death is recorded, at the age of 82,
of Mrs. Plunkett, relict of John Hubert Plunkett,
Imperial Attorney-General in the days of the
“System,” and in the era of responsible govern-
ment President of N.S.W. Legislative Council.
Mr. Plunkett first came to Australia with a letter
of introduction from Daniel O’Connell.
The election of R. D. Meagher, “Pos-
sum ” Dean’s solicitor, for the Phillip division of
Sydney, recalls the election to the Commons of
Dr. Kenealy, Q.C., Orton’s counsel, while the
claimant’s trial was in progress. Public sympathy
was at that time with the Wagga Wagga butcher
as it was always with the North Shore Ferry
captain.
Knights James Frederick Palmer and
StawelJ were the first Victorians to be thus
labelled. Palmer, President of the Leg. Council,
though a qualified doctor, at one time hawked
ginger-beer in Melb. When he died, Coppin
bought his hilly estate by the Yarra, called it St.
James’s Park, after him, and made a heap of
money by cutting it up.
Clever, honest Nat. Levi is one of the un-

him, were Victorian coal and beet sugar. Now
Nat keeps whittling round his No. 3 idea, the
Melb. Evening News.
Whenever the subject of longevity is being
discussed, the veteran journalist, David Blair,
always tells that he was born in 1820, and that his
grandfather, who first saw the light in 1750, did
not die until he (D. B.) was a young man of 17
years. His grandfather, when a child, had seen
and spoken to very old men, who fought at the
Battle of the Boyne in 16S!).

Vic. Govt. Geologist
Murray has applied for his
pension, and been refused.
Victoria is quite right, for
Mr. Murray being one of
the best of all Australian
geologists, and in the very
prime of life, his superan-
nuation would be a public
calamity. Many stories are

“Coal, sir, Skipton coal,

Vale, triumphantly. Mur-
ray bent over it for a few
seconds, then asked : “ Mr.
Vale, do you b-b-believe in

all life b-b-by fire ?” “Cer-
tainly, sir.” “ Then,” con-

The noble name of Jones threw its baleful
shadow over a recent Melb. (Vic.) shipping-
inquest. He who fell down the hatchway and
necessitated the proceedings was Jones. The
captain of the vessel was also Jones (no relation to
No. 1). The first mate answered to Jones (no
relation to either of the foregoing). Then the
constable who removed the corpse arose and
solemnly assured the court that he likewise was
Jones. And lastly it transpired that the under-
taker’s name was Jones.
A plucky pioneer has just passed over at
86 years, at Charters Towers —John Leahy, who
paid down £4O “for his passage to Port Phillip
in 1839,” the ship being the Duke of Argyle,
whereby also came as passenger John O’Shanassy,
afterwards Premier of the province. It was Leahy
who “backed” Esmond, the gold-finder, who
came from California with Hargreaves, while the
latter searched Buninyong. Leahy also put in
an appearance at Eureka Stockade in Dec., 1854,
and had resided with his son at Charters Towers
for 20 years before his death.

Gurr, M.P. for Geelong, is the baldest man

Life, he says, is too short for a man to be pestered
with the care of a head of hair. On one occasion,
when addressing his constituents, be told an
anecdote founded on a moving experience of his
own, concluding : “ And, gentlemen, I assure you
I escaped death by a hair’s breadth.” It was his
best anecdote, and he paused after its delivery
for the cheers. But an icy silence reigned for a
few moments, and was broken by a shrill voice
near the door : “ Say, mister, where did you get
that hair ? ”
There are three Israelites in the new
N.S.W. Parliament — viz., Collins, of Narrabri;
Phillips, of Dubbo; and (whisper it gently) Harry
Levien. Of these the last-named is an Opposi-
tionist. the middle man a Govt, supporter, and
the first a cross-bench “road-and-bridge” member.
They are thus distributed about the Chamber,
making a perfect political Mosaic, so to speak.

N.S.W. Premier Reid is a barrister,
though not exactly a star barrister. One of his
most fervid supporters, addressing a city meet-
ing in opposition to B. R. Wise during the elec-
tion, exclaimed : “You can never trust those fel-
lows who wear horsehair,” A shout of laughter
went up as the speaker was reminded that Premier
Reid occasionally wore horsehair. “Ah, yes,”
replied the partisan of Georgey Porgey, “but
only occasionally.” The answer fitted the bill.
A well-known classical tutor, who has
coached hundreds of young Victorians for the‘
University, remembers the ill-fated Saunders;
girls, slaughtered in China, as the most likeable,
lively, and troublesome of all his pupils, past or
present. Those were their frisky days, however,
before the advent of evangelist Clarke. After-
wards they sobered down, renouncing dancing
and kindred frivolities, to throw themselves with
characteristic “go ” and energy into mission pro-
jects.
Col. “ Fire-low ” Price, so goes the story,
was once imprisoned in Pentridge. Forty years
ago, when his father, the doughty John Price,-
was Inspector-General of Vic. Penal Establish-
ments, “Tom” (as the Col. was christened) in--
! irred the old man’s wrath through some boyish'
eioapade, and was ordered into the garden of
the governor’s house for three weeks’ hard,
labor. There was an armed warder hard by,
“ See that this young man keeps to his work and
goes to his meals and knocks off when the othn
prisoners are going,” said the genial Price, pere,
“Tom” did his time like a man. Had he at
tempted to escape, the warder would have hac'
to fire very low.
Henniker Heaton (whose son, late of
Eton, has just passed his exam, for the Guards
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent) h
just now much chagrined. He fully expected tin
Postmaster-Generalship, and they do say he sal
at home for four days awaiting a message from
Salisbury—but, alas, none arrived. That there
is some color of truth in this story is evidenced
by the fact that numbers of printed copies of
press-opinions with regard to his fitness for the
office have been circulated broadcast. If Henniker
himself caused this to be done, it was a fatal error
of judgment; and if it was the work of his friends,
they have done him an irreparable injury. Self-
advertising is an unpardonable sin in the eyes of
the Tory leaders, and seldom do those wl o
practise it to any extent ever get anything for
their pains. But Heaton, if he really expectedl
ever to be made Postmaster-General, is a muclr
deluded man. He is too vigorous and persistent
a reformer, and would only have been a disap-
pointment ; for, once in office, he would never
have dared to introduce any of the great changes
he has pegged at for the last six or seven years,
and, as for penny ocean postage, no Chancellor of
the Exchequer would ever consent to the loss of
revenue it would entail.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Premier Reid’s appointments have in-
creased the number of lawyers in N.S.W. Leg.
Council to 15.
At the recent Auckland Parliamentary
bye-electicn the women polled G to 4 of the
total 10,000 votes recorded.
N.S.W. Legislative Council now consists
exactly of 70 members. Appointed by Cowper, 1;
Robertson, 1; Stuart, 8; Reid, 12; Dibbs, 15;
Parkes, 33.
As the present N.S.W. Parliamentary
session is to be chiefly a financial one, Premier
Reid ought to bring in a bill to prove that two-
and-two make five.
In June, Australia paid £2625 for the use
of six English Governors. Yet only one of those
Governors was then in Australia. Perhaps that
is why Heaven sends no rain.
Murray’s action, in refraining from going
on with the division on the Yic. Totalisator Bill,
saved several members from a showing-up. They
would have found it hard to account for a glaring
change of front.
Brief, clear-cut bit of Tasmanian legisla-
tion : “ From and after the passing of this Act no
order for the attachment of any of the wages of
any servant, laborer, or workman, shall be made
by the Judge of any court.”
Sydney Daily Telegraph unabashedly
undertakes the task of teaching Premier Reid
how he can have absolute Freetrade and at the
same time execute reciprocal Customs treaties
between N.S. Wales and other countries !
Several of the prominent S. A. stone wallers,
notably Ash and Castine, are under bond with
Premier Kingston not to talk unnecessarily this
session, the object-being to prorogue next Nov. in
view of the 1896 elections, which promise to be
very stormy.
N.S.W. Opposition chief Lyne’s touching
reference to his late “revered leader” caused
someone to suggest that Lyne should resign in
favor of Dibbs. “You had better resign your-
self,” said Lyne. “ But I don’t want to see him
back,” retorted the other.
Tas. Assembly has agreed to give women a
vote as property-owners and occupiers, both for
Council and Assembly, under the new Constitu-
tion Act. Tasmania is such an obscure little place
that this new triumph of “ the cause ” has passed
almost unnoticed on the mainland.
Sydney Municipal Council has now but
one representative (the much-gilded Matt. Harris)
in N.S.W. Leg. Assembly. Time was when it
had nearly half-a-score; and now, for the first
time in its history, the N.S.W. Leg. Council
numbers two Sydney aldermen within its fold.
N.S.W. Premier Reid (on the Piddington-
Dibbs scrum at Tamworth) : “David was a match
for Goliath in that place.” Yes, and the clown
Plunderus was a match for the Giant Blunderbore
in King Division (Sydney). But these be merely
stray hurricane flotsams in the big sea of history.
A political resurrection of fatal importance
(to the N.S.W. Hansard staff) is Mr. Jawbone
Neild. This is a gentleman who once spoke for
nine hours consecutively. At least the hours were
consecutive; the speech wasn’t. Since this out-
rage occurred, the standing orders have been
altered accordingly.

N.S.W. EX - PREMIER PARKES HAND.
Angus Cameron, M.P. (N.S.W.), is a
living example in politics of the proverb “ While
there’s life there’s hope.” Who would have ex-
pected that this able man, who had so many more
chances, politically, than other men (and missed
them) would ever have risen again, on the ashes
of his dead self, to the dignity of a very long black
coat, -a very shiny top-hat, and a tree railway-
pass?
While felicitating Angus Cameron, M.P.
(N.S.W.), on his legislative resurrection, The
Bulletin is glad to notice that he has not been
made Chairman of Committees at .£BOO a year.
Having had the front to stand as an opponent of
payment to members, Mr. Cameron is very pro-
perly allowed, so far as office is concerned, to soak
in his own gravy.
“Jim” Hogue, back again to N.S.W.
Assembly, which he first entered in charge of the
Sergeant-at-Arms, shows how the scholarly attri-
butes necessary for the editorship of Sydney E.
News combine to disqualify a man for distinction
in a deliberative Assembly. To what base uses
we may return ! But, then, the bellman at Bunny
Corner is a B. A.
Premier Reid sneaked “the Divine gui-
dance ” into the vice-regal speech at last week’s
opening of N.S.W. Parliament. The re-appear-
ance of this abandoned splinter of hypocrisy is
due to the “nonconformist conscience” of Cook,
Garrard, Gould and Co. If hon. members have
faith in “the Divine guidance,” therl let them
abolish the Sergeant-at-Arms.
Seeing that N.S.W. Leg. Council loudly
professes a burning desire to give effect to the
will of the N.S.W. people, but excuses itself from
knowing, or attempting to define, what that will
is, because of the confusion of issues in which
every Parliamentary election is clouded, now is
the time for the Assembly to send along a Plebi-
scitum and Referendum Bill. Yet the Council
pre-indicates its opposition to that form of ascer-
taining the public pleasure.
It w T as a sectional political necessity for
the N.S.W. “Reid party” to repudiate B. R.
Wise and to manoeuvre him out of his Parlia-
mentary seat. A man who so clearly saw, as did
Wise, the whole game of humbug being played by
Reid, and who did not hesitate to depict it in
naked te/ms in the letter to Parkes, written as far
back as June 4, but only printed week before last,
was too dangerous or candid a friend to hug to a
conjuror’s bosom. Wise, in the midst of the
Reid crowd, was a hissing shell with the slow-fuse
alight ; and Reid’s powder-monkeys hove him
overboard.
The long-lost Local Government Bill
doesn’t appear on the Reid (N.S. W.) Govern-
ment’s programme this session, and it seems to
have again dropped out of sight indefinitely, ihe
reason for its absence, said Premier Reid to ex-
Treas. See in reply to a question by the latter,
“is because you cut its throat.” Somebody
should take Reid aside and yell in his ear
the real facts of the ease, which are that he
deliberately withdrew the Local Government Bill
against the wishes of the majority of the House,
because the House would not let him insert into
it an altogether new proviso giving Eat Man a
maximum of 20 votes, instead of five, at munici-
pal elections—a proviso of which nobody had any
previous notice. G. Reid s Local Government
Bill wasn’t murdered ; it committed suicide.
Editor Bulletin,— The Junee Labor
League supported Arthur Rae because he is in
favor of the reforms set out in the Labor platform,
and not, as you wrongly state, because of his Free-
trade leanings. Had the fiscal curse assumed
Protectionist shape in him we would have closed
our eyes to the defect and voted for him just the
same. Also, no member of this League is
pecuniarily interested in the retention of the
grain-duties, a fact which should have a flatten-
ing-out effect on your jibe. The successful Protec-
tionist candidate here is opposed to land taxation,
also to Upper House reform, fails to see any
points in Woman Suffrage, and don’t give a rap
for the Referendum. The Bulletin may have
observed that most Protectionist patriots are
built that way.— Leaguer. [ls The Bulletin,
then, to understand that the Junee Labor League
ia in no way interested in agriculture, and that
its members demand the abolition of the produce
duties? —Ed. B.]
London cablegram ; “Great Britain will
require 192,000,000 bushels of wheat prior to Sep-
tember, ’O6. This is twice the quantity America
will be able to export to all countries.” Could
there be a much more significant commentary on
the absolute insanity of Britain’s Freetrade policy
amid a nest of warlike nations whose hostility if f
always “on the hair trigger?” England’sgranary
should be England. Given a three-weeks’
blockade of Britain, and its starving millions would
turn cannibal, and eat up the monarchy and the
lords and the plutocrats, as a first course. And
then ? Freetrade-and the idolatrously-wor-
shipped “cheap loaf” have frozen out Britain’s
food resources, and, in the day of adversity, the
harvest will be the fatted flesh of the dogmatic
and domineering Cobdenites. The boasted navy
that formerly swept the seas is the one crutch
with which the old Freetrade cripple can attempt
to defend itself. A perilous chance.
The exact amount of theS.A. deficit at the
end of last financial year was <£99,556. The
accrued deficits of the province now stand at
<£900,000, and those of the Northern Territory at
.£350,000, or a total of ,£1,250,000.
N.S. W. Parliamentary Protectionist-leader
Lyne says that he would be “as pleased as any-
one ”to see Dibbs back, leading the party. But
LET BYGONES , doc
MR. BETTERDAY: “ You've owed me an account for the last eight
years” .
MR. HARDCASE : “ Well, there’s no need to bring up old grievances.”
then, nobody except the Freetraders would like
to see Dibbs back leading the Protectionists.
When the present writer lodged in Mac-
quarie-atreet, Sydney, long ago, he was often kept
awake for hours at night by the yells of John
M‘Elhone, M.P., in the Legislative chamber over
the road. Now, after weary y £ rs, John is again
in Parliament, and this poor scribe thanks Heaven
that he no longer boards in Macquarie-street.
From various little signs, it is easy to see
that the S.M. Herald has no particular love for
Premier Reid—who lately addressed an election
crowd from the Daily Telegraph office-windows.
But the Herald is sleuth-like and politic. It
is not going to publicly bite out Reid’s larynx ;
but it will “ get there” by privately putting a little
septic matter on the lancet wherewith it bene-
volently opens the fat gentleman’s political boils.
An opportune argument in favor of the
“tote.” A bookmaker the other day refused to
pay a debt which he had lost, walloped the
winner—an old man—until he was dragged off
him by some bystanders, used an immense quan-
tity of bad language, then got on a horse and
chased the ancient backer and walloped him a
second time, until he was again dragged off by
some more bystanders, and yet escaped before a
spineless magistrate with a miserable fine. Also,
the bet still remains unpaid. The tote, on the
other hand, never refuses to pay its honest debts,
never swears or commits brutal assaults, never
drinks or smokes, doesn’t solicit custom or adver-
tise for it, doesn’t bribe the police or detectives,
never plays fraudulent card games, doesn’t haunt
billiard-tables or public-houses, never misconducts
itself with the pretty girl at the hotel when it has
had a good day, and doesn’t tell indecent stories,
or wear gaudy clothes and glaring red ties with big
diamonds in them, or decorate two dirty fat hands
with cameo rings. If these aren’t reasons enough
in its favor the church is hard to satisfy.
Sydney Telegraph, in a recent leader,
declares against the adoption of the minimum
wage system on Government works, on the ground
that it is contrary to the eternal doctrines of
Freeraid :
A moment’s consideration shows that if men engaged
on contracts or otherwise in work subject to Govern-
mental control, are paid a higher rate than their services
could be purchased for, they are made pensioners to the
extent of the difference upon public bounty. They stand
in exactly the same relationship to the community at
large as do the proprietors of protected industries whom
the public are compelled to subsidise in order that their
callings may be made sufficiently profitable. It is singular
to find the Minister for Works of the most thorough free-
trade Government this colony has ever had adopting the
methods of Protectionism and its logical complement,
State socialism, as in this matter he has done.
Very singular, certainly; but, then, where is the
Freetrader who dares to live up to his own soulless
creed? Even the Telegraph hasn’t begun to
demand the abolition of the N.S.W. free-news-
paper-postage system, by which it is protected,
at a heavy expense to the nation, against the com-
petition of its foreign and country contemporaries.
A well-informed correspondent ‘ The
persistence of The Bulletin in re the infamous
Mt. Rennie trial has at last borne fruit. The
Govt, has chosen one who is the ablest and most
fair-minded of N.S.W. criminal lawyers to look

In Vic. Assembly, it was sought to class
as “ urgent” the bill to provide for more popular
hours of polling, in order that the measure might
be applied to the local municipal elections on
22nd Aug. Graham Berry gave this memorable
ruling : that “ as the bill enlarged the franchise ot
the people, it was a matter of urgency.”
One thing is be-
coming tolerably cer-
tain —Victoria cannot
retrench very much
further. Premier Tur-
ner proposes to run the
province next year on a
total outlay of <£s 10s.
per head the same
rate as in 1877. But as
the interest on the
public debt is about
twice as much as it was
then, and the railway
system is immensely
larger in proportion to
population, and conse-
quently absorbs more in
wages, this really means
a very great reduction
in all other depart-
ments compared to the
estimates of 18 years
ago. If the latest re-
trenchments don’t keep
the finances square, the
time will not be very
far off when more taxa-
tion will be inevitable.
Victoria levies the
smallest Customs re-
venue per head of all
the Australasian pro-
vinces, and has also
the smallest expendi-
ture, Tasmania only
excepted, so that if
things grow much worse
the land-tax question
will come to the front
again to a certainty.
Dalrymple, chief
opponent of State
Socialism in Queens-
land, is, by the irony
of fate, the head of its
most important State
Socialistic department
viz., Education. The
eloquent Dal. wrote an
article the other day
in the Q. Educational
Journal, containing
an account of a Social-
istic experiment in
China which proved a
lamentable failure. At the end of Dalrymple s
Ministerial career he will probably be anxious to
show that State Socialism, as evidenced in the
management of the Education Department under
his supervision, has proved a magnificent success.
George Ash, Premier Kingston’s partner,
finding that law pays and politics don’t, does not
intend to seek re-election to the Assembly.
The Argus squeals when you touch the
shipping interests and shipping rings. Tucker’s
Free Port proposals will incidentally favor tramp-
vessels—the sweaters of the shipping system. The
encouragement of tramp ships would mean the
discouragement of shipping rings. The ARGUS :
The only weak proposal is that relating to “tramp”
vessels, which are popularly supposed to go “on spec.’
from port to port in search of cargo, like so many wander-
ing flying Dutchmen, Perhaps no great harm will he
done in making a present of a few pounds to the owners
of every “tramp” that turns up in Port Phillip, but to
make the present will be altogether a work of superero-
gation.
Yic. export trade is at present seriously threatened
by the big shipping ring. Four or five “ tramps,”
cheaply berthed in Hobson’s Bay, would bring a
change o’er the spirit of the night-mare.

infuriated bullock turned and charged madly at

Mr. Blaxland was unahle to avoid the onrush.
The bullock’s horn entered the horse’s chest, in-

The rush of debutantes to be stuck on the
sacred dais at Mrs. Madden’s acting-vice-regal
“hop” is a screaming farce. Some of them are
very downy chickens, who have been “out,” as
far as the Melb. Block is concerned, for several
seasons. They wink their other eye, the innocents,
as they go through the dais rites. The dais afore-
said is known down South as “Mrs. Madden’s
Slave-Market.”
* * #
The patronage of acting-vice-royalty didn’t
go for much at the Melb. Hospital elections last
week. Madden’s candidate, the bould O’Hara,
was beaten out of a place as indoor-surgeon by 800
votes. This deepens The Bulletin’s suspicions
re the blighting influence of His Gracious
Majesty, John M. And the more he waxes, the
more it wanes.
# • •
On the day of Melb. hospital election, a
boy, dressed in correct coachman’s rig, drove up
and down Collins-street a diminutive dog-cart
harnessed to a Liliputian pony, the vehicle being
plastered over with :
Subscribers to Melbourne Hospital,
vote for
Dr. !
• • •
One other Melbourne medical man, at
least, goes from the beaten track of professional
etiquette. Noticing in a ’bus, the other day, a
lady who was evidently about to increase her
worldly responsibilities, he politely presented his
card, and apologetically expressed a hope that, as
she would shortly be requiring a doctor, he would
not be forgotten. Solemn fact.
• • *
Lieut -Gov. Way has given another break-
fast to a score of assorted parsons at Adelaide
Government House. The atmosphere is gradually
being got into a fit state for the reception of Rev.
Fowell Buxton. The only thing the evangelical
brewer can now do to rehabilitate his character in
Adelaide is to utter an audible “Damn !” before
some considerable concourse of people just after
landing.

The general Australian clerical theory
appears to be that, in permitting {i.e., ordering)
the Chinese missionary-massacres, the Omnipo-
tent was only breaking eggs to make omelettes.
# • «
The executive committee of the Church
Missionary Association is going to honor in the
usual way the memories of the missionaries mas-
sacred at Ku-Cheng. In other words, it has been
decided to take up a collection.
• # #
C. P. Hodges, Chinese interpreter and
Mandarin of the Crystal Button, says that the
reparation for the Ku-Cheng massacres will be
that a few men, prompted by filial duty, will con-
sent to be beheaded on a guarantee that their
parents will be provided for during life.

While booming female missions to the
Heathen Chinee, Sydney ladies might remember
that in N.S. W. are numerous spots where their
surplus energy might well be expended. For
instance, Liverpool Asylum, where nearly a thou-
sand hopelessly decrepit men are housed—at
least 400 being in hospital. The only lady visitors
are the Sisters from the local convent. In Parra-
matta Asylums also are to be found a great
number who rarely receive a kindly visit from
anybody, male or female.
# » •
The Chinese are the most liberal sub-
scribers to the Melb. hospital. Their subscrip-
tions, in proportion to their wealth and numbers,
far exceed those of any other class. At the
elections for the medical staff, on Thursday last,
50 or CO of them voted in a body for Dr. Boyd,
the young surgeon who made the discovery of the
poisoning of Louis Juncken, which led to the
execution of Martha Needle, the Richmond lodg-
ing-house keeper
• * *
Last week, the N.S.W. board of advice to
the China Inland Mission, considered applications
from three male volunteer missionaries and one
female ditto. Two of these will probably be des-
patched—to be despatched. And, of course, one
of the twain is the female —“ an ewe lamb of tin
flock, without spot or blemish.”

London Wesleyan Conference, which, it is
cabled, has again refused to admit women dele-
gates, undoubtedly remembers how Airs. Wesley
used to thrust her tongue out at Mr. W. while
he preached about that dreadful hell where the
sinner doth with devils dwell in darkness, fire and
chains — The Bulletin loses the inspiration just
here, not having its hymn-book at hand.

It is related that a business employe of a
“great ” Australian daily lately bought a bicycle
with a view to going the rounds, and asked the
proprietor, in consideration of the saving of tram-
fares, to subsidise the machine. “Sir,” said the
manager, “the use of a bicycle would not be con-
sistent with the—er —Dignity of the Morning
Tinpot.” Like the Pope, that manager knows a
thing or two. The man who rides a bicycle
thereby invites exclusive attention to his legs, and
the legs of the average man, like those of the
average woman, really aren’t worth looking at.

The Sydney Scotchman who shared
lodgings with another man suffering from typhoid
takes the cake—for Scotchness. Scottie (a life-
assurance man), very careful of his own health,
was told by the doctor that his co-lodger must die
that night, and as a matter of duty to himself as
an official of the co. in which his fellow-lodger,
the landlord and the lady of the house were all
insured, he ordered and paid for a coffin for the
dying man, so that no time might be lost in re-
moving a possible source of infection. The
patient recovered, after all, but it was a year
before Scottie dared to mention the matter of the
coffin to his pal. Even then he funked doing it
verbally, but eventually he posted to him the
following account (verbatim):
To
Polished oak coffin, satin-lined, nickel-plated
furniture .. .. .. .. £2O 0 0
Twelve months interest at 8 per cent. .. 1 12 0
£2l 12 9

The last prisoner hanged in Darling-
hurst gaol had, when taken out of the con-
demned cell for his daily exercise, to pass and
repass the prison morgue or “dead-house,” where
his own remains would shortly be laid out. This
refinement of torture was accentuated by the pro-
minent way in which the purpose of the building
is indicated. It is an ivy-covered stone structure,
over the door of which are sculptured, in high
relief, a huge grinning skull and crossbones,
flanked by an extinguisher and an hour-glass.
And the last thing seen by a N.S,W. condamne is
a noseless hangman with gorilla arms. Ugh !
Yet the fear of the gallows doesn’t prevent murder
any more than the fear of hell prevents sin.
# # #
The contents of documents found on an
arrested man do not seem to be officially regarded
as confidential, even if they have no criminal
bearing. A year ago, a man having fallen into the
hands of a Northern detective for false pretences,
he was searched in the usual manner and his
papers taken over by the police. Next day he
was brought before the Court and remanded for a
week, his bail being fixed at a certain amount,
which was forthcoming from the man at whose
residence prisoner lodged. But the police, for
some reason, objected to the release of accused,
and interviewed the bailor to dissuade him from
his intention. He, however, was firm, and an-
nounced that nothing on earth would make him
alter his mind. He believed in the man’s inno-
cence, he knew ho would not attempt to abscond,
and, as he had always been a good friend to him,
he was going to stand by him. Seeing him deter-
mined, the wily D. produced a love-letter osten-
sibly written by the bailor’s wife to the imprisoned
lodger—the lodger again !it is always the lodger
—expressing the warmest affection for him and
referring to her lawful hubby as a “ bald-headed
old scoundrel.” “ Are yer going ter bail him out
noxv ?” asked the detective. “ No,” answered the
injured one, jamming on his hat; “ I’m going to
look for my wife.”
* « «-
A bank-clerk was lately suspected of
“ going through ” the pockets of the other clerks’
coats. A detective was engaged and secreted
himself in the room where these were hanging.
The suspected man came, and, sure enough, began
operations, turning out pockets for stray coins
and tram tickets, and all the while humming to
himself, “Nearer my God to Thee !”
* * *
Thus a Colonia Cosmd man to a Bulletin
correspondent:—“ There is a most peculiar inver-
sion in the relations of the sexes in this country.
You will meet a woman driving a team of bullocks
and carrying a baby at the same time, while the
man lolls at ease in the waggon. I have seen a
woman walking along with an enormous cigar
planted behind her ear and puffing another in her
mouth. The soil is excellent. The other day an
Englishman asked a native what was the right
time to plough, and the native told him he had
been eight years on the soil without ploughing,
but he would start in about two years.”
* # #
A Bulletin correspondent writes from
Samoa : —We have exceedingly cheerful news from
Lane in Paraguay. Cosme flourishing as well as
possible time and circumstances considered.
Abundance of food and milk, and over 100 acres
ot cleared land ready for planting. By the way,
did you hear, at the time of Mrs. Lane’s start,
that Casey having refused her passage-money
from the sale of the Royal Tar, several of the
seamen, whose wages had only then been paid
up, clubbed together and brought their little all
that she might .rejoin her husband ? Amid a
general display of selfishness, that sort of thing
revives faith in humanity !
• * »
That the supply of local sawbones has
overtaken the demand, and a bit more, is appar-
ently evidenced by the fact that Sydney Univer-
sity Senate asks N.S. W. Government to beg the
British Government to let it nominate three
doctors to posts in the British army, British navy,
and Indian army respectively.
# * #
Last week’s Sydney divorce business was
agreeably varied by the granting of rules nisi on
the application of five husbands who complained
that their wives had deserted them. The ground
of desertion only has seldom been previously pre-
ferred by a male petitioner. Five deserted hus-
bands !
• * *
To translate -Judge Windeyer’s language
into plain English : The public naturally suspects
the lawyer who, when moving for a divorce, gets
into the witness-box and swears that the co-
respondent came secretly to his office arid ad-
mitted the commission of sinister acts. In any
case, it is highly improbable that a co-respondent
would visit a hostile solicitor merely to enable
that solicitor to complete a case against him ; also,
when a co-respondent does so, there is a strong
smell of “collusion” about. Further, if a co-
respondent does so, and afterwards denies that he
did so, it is a spring-balance case of oath against
oath—a lawyer’s against a layman’s.
.• • •
A female divorce petitioner appeared
before Windeyer, J., last week, in Sydney, wear-
ing a hat-band bearing, in large gold letters, the
word —“Liberty!” She gained her suit, and may
now be manoeuvring for asccond term of “slavery.”
A lot of petitioners, by the way, might brand
their hats “License.”
In N.S. Wales Divorce Court last week
divorces were granted at about the rate of 15 per
diem.
# # *
Since the recent export of young ladies
(engaged) to the Indian marriage-market, there
has been quite a rush of lovely debutantes to that
favored climate in hopes of making matches, as
the art seems to have died out in Victoria. For-
merly, India was a sure and certain market for
eligible girls ; nowadays, with the rupee at Is. Id.,
and the ever-present scare of another insurrection,
the country is not the happy hunting-ground of 30
years ago. Still, the prospect is better than that of
China.
• • *
The professional feuds of Scotch and Irish
doctors have passed into a proverb in N.S. Wales.
What is now “ popping up ” in Sydney is the dis-
tinctive jealousy between Scotch and Irish—or,
say, Scottish-Australian and Irish-Australian —
lawyers. If Scotch doctors seem to prevail in
medicine, the Irish lawyers have it mostly their
own way.
# * •
It is finally decided that Brassey is to be
landed at Deeming’s pier, St. Kilda, The Lud is
about due at the time when the aroma of the
stranded shell-fish begins to take possession of the
Victorian Ghetto, and Brassey is bound to dis-
cover that St. Kilda’s strength lies in her mussels.
There’s the difficulty : you cannot land from the
water anywhere within convenient reach of Mel-
bourne without striking a paralysing odor of some
kind. There’s a flavor of scent per scent all over
the shop. The aroma of the boom clings to the
place. By the way, Vanity Fair, possibly with
a sneer, suggests that Brassey will find Melbourne
and Melbourne society “quite to his ta.ste.”
Evidently his lordship’s smell is not considered.
# m #
Months ago The Bulletin stated that, if
the true story of the Butler (Sydney) divorce-case
were told, it would shake up local society. So
far, three of the active conspirators have been
sentenced to an aggregate imprisonment of 18
years; proceedings are being initiated against a
solicitor ; Mrs. Butler’s brother seems likely to
be released from prison on the grounds of wrong-
ful conviction ; and the body of John Copp,
Butler’s former employer, a chemist, who died
rather suddenly some four years ago, m'ay possibly
be exhumed.
C"pp, a chemist, of Darlington, Sydney, the
circumstances of whose death are said to have been
su-pioious, was a born naturalist, and devoted all
his spare time to the stocking of a museum at the
back of his shop. Botanists and naturalists have
come from all quarters to view his collection,
which contained some of the rarest and costliest
specimens of the animal and vegetable world. But
it is altogether unlikely that, if deceased was
poisoned as alleged, the fact could now be fully
established. The theory of those who suspect
Copp to have been murdered fits in only with the
administration of a vegetable, evanescent poison.
The gentle Kanaka who comes to Queens-
land for the benefit of his immortal soul, set upon
a white man at Mackay, a month ago, and
literally carved him into mincemeat. Fifty
hideous gashes did the doctor count on the unfor-
tunate white man’s carcase ; and Mackay is peti-
tioning to get the Polynesians locked up every
night on the plantations. The blackbird-traffic
isn’t slavery.
# # #
From the inquest upon the latest Mel-
bourne suicide (he shot his sweetheart before
killing himself) :
He said he had lost money on Grand Duke shares, and
had come to Melbourne last week to retrieve ids losses by
betting at the V.A.T.C. Grand National Steeplechase
meeting.
Mad, mad, mad. Mine, horse, woman. Positive,
comparative, superlative.

“How is the curse of Deeming getting
on ?’’ This instance of it is as yet unrecorded.
Two days before the hanging, the murderer’s
attorney fell in witii a party of footballers at
Mordialloc. He had a drink with them, and saw
them off in the boat by which they were going to
Mornington to play a match. They pressed him
to accompany them, but Mr. Lyle declined. That
boating party encountered the full weight of the
curse. The boat was upset, and every man in it
drowned.
# # •
Very tardily Vic. authorities are resur-
recting the smellful Synnot case by instituting an
enquiry into the evidence given at the trial by-
three constables. It has just occurred to some-
body that whether the badly-broken-up testimony
against Mrs. Synnot was largely perjury, or an
extraordinary instance of mistaken identity, the
policemen showed up badly. If perjury, they
were rogues; if mistaken identity, they were
fools; and, therefore, they are dangerous as police-
men, anyhow.

In Melbourne they have lowered the tax
On corsets to a small per cent.,
But if the duty were more lax

Re the unreliability of girl witnesses : In
the case of a man charged before Vic. Justice Hood
with criminally assaulting his daughter, aged 14,
a younger daughter, aged 11, stated that she saw
her father enter the room and commit the assault,
but admitted, under cross-examination, that her
statement was untrue, and she only made it be-
cause Auntie told me to.” ‘• Auntie told me sle
would give me a silk dress and a hat, and shoes if
I told lies of father.” This sort of thing has
become-so common in the courts as to make i
questionable whether the unsupported testimony
of girls under the age of consent should evei be
admitted, *

Joseph Cook, the parson from Boston
(U.S.A.), is not only a sky-pilot but aims also at
being an earth-pilot. Says he : “ The chief article
in the commercial life of the world is religion.
Wrong The chief article in the commercial life
of the world is Cant, labelled “Religion. . this
spuriously-labelled Cant is a veritable article of
commerce : it is bought and sold and haggled
over, It is branded like the soaps of commerce,
and every brander declares that his own brand is
not only the best, but the only genuine reli-
gion ” in the market. But, make no mistake,
real religion never gets into the market, never
comes nearer “ commercial life than ftinus or

As a further instalment of Mr. Justice

Dear Bulletin, —Here’s one hona-f.de miss
of a doomed ship. I once saw, at Derry, a batch
of about 50 excited Mayo peasants, the men
ferocious and the women virulent because, after
travelling 00 miles, they had barely missed their
passage to Canada by a M.O.S.S. boat —which
vessel, with 400 souls on board, was never heard
of again.—M.

At a recent in-
quest on r man wlio
died inMelb. hospi-
tal the police stated
that deceased had
served a long term
in gaol and been
flogged for a brutal
assault on a woman.
He had done no
good since his re-
lease —having been
continually drunk.
But the police de-
partment kn e w
more than that. 11
knew that the same
woman was found
some years ago (after
the aforesaid man’s
conviction) i n a
state of collapse and
taken to the same
hospital, where, on
her dying deposi-
tions, warrants were
issued for the arrest
of two men of de-
cent repute. At the
inquest it was
shown that no out-
rage had been com-
mitted, that her
shocking injuries
(which, added to
the drink, had
caused her death)
were self-inflicted.
The instrument
with which the
woman had injured
herself was found,
and the case was
perfectly clear. The
man who was flog-
ged always protes-
ted that the woman’s
injuries were self-
inflicted, but was
not believed. Yet
the other day aN.S.
Wales Q.C. said
that it was “incon-
ceivable that a
young woman on
the threshold of
life” would do some-
thing or other ! Of

Rev. Dr. Gordon, of the Presbytery of
Melbourne South, is anxious to see the Vic.
Licensing Act amended with a view to the aboli-
tion of barmaids and of window-blinds in public-
houses. This shepherd thinks that men would
not drink at bars if they were left in full view of
people passing. A law making it compulsory for
publicans to sprinkle their bars with asafmtida
several times a day, or to employ only Chinese
lepers to serve out drinks, would be more likely to
have the effect desired by the rev. reformer, and
he is welcome to make what use he pleases of IHR
Bulletin’s suggestion. At the same time, the
Licensed Victuallers should hasten to agitate for
the immediate abolition of pretty female teachers
in Sunday schools, lovely choristers in churches,
and also comely chambermaids in coffee-palaces—
which are ten times more dangerous to female
virtue than decent hotels —and for an Act pro-
hibiting the holding of sacerdotal picnics in
scrubby places, and restricting these at fresco
festivities to the centre of wide and barren plains
where the bilious superintendent and the coy
soprano may always be distinctly visible to the
naked eye at a distance of several miles.

The interest in Cellular Clothing is be
coming widespread. The extent of application o f
Cellular fabric is so large that it may be said to
cover every variety of clothing for all seasons and
for all climates. Since the doctors recommend it,
and since it gives the maximum warmth with the
minimum weight, and is therefore peculiarly suit-
able for Australian climates, it is not surprising
to find it quickly superseding the old materials
used for underclothing. The sole agents for the
colony of Victoria are Messrs. Hicks, Atkinson
and Sons, of Collins-street. Economy is also
among the virtues of Cellular Clothing.*

Shoes. Riley Brothers still continue the system
originated by them 20 years ago of sending i. 5
Drapery Bales and £2 parcels, carriage paid, and
a large business is now done daily in
postal orders from Gd. upwards. One of Riley
Brothers’ latest investments is the purchase of the

ftiv Dbah Moorabinda—
The Military Papprchase across tlie harmless
Botany flats last Thursday was doubtless a
“merry run ” from the point of view of a girl who
/ides with her heel up ; but some of the “ timber-
lakers” present found the innocuous canter
lit rough the scrub to Long Bay a rather unexciting
Say’s work under Y.R. patronage. Acting-
Governoress D.trley drove to the tryst, accom-
panied by Miss Kitty Darley, in a black-and-blue
itriped gown and a blue neck ruffle ; Miss Sylvia
Barley drove too, in the sequel, for her cream
pony turned Turk in the part, and she followed
she run in a dog-cart. Tea awaited the chasers
at the finish, and, after tea, the whole company
were photographed on foot—front view, fortu-
nately for an equestrienne in tan jack boots and
one of the “safety” riding-skirts, which are like
an apron, split up the back till further orders,
and so do not lend themselves to promenading in
mixed company. The rear-view of this damsel
(who cut a very neat and pretty figure in the
saddle) was the most astonishing thing in splits I
have seen since Florence Young wore that rose-
trimmed black gown in Madame Angot. After
all, society girls have their duly-authorised little
ways of getting even with the burlesque stage.
But all the sartorial interest wasn’t on the
feminine side. Major-General Hutton turned out
in a hat with a “ poultice ’’ on it, and a check-
suit that ought certainly to be liequeathed to the
nearest low-comedian when the M.G, takes his
departure. Though, of course, checks are all the
go, horsily speaking, even if they don’t suit every-
body. A very popular youth most unwisely wore
a Tattersall-check vest which increased his waist
to 1 alstafflan proportions, though his extra-roomy
riding-pants showed great perspicuity on his
tailor s part, I must say. Air. Cecil Hope’s most
Striking feature was his yellow breeches, the color
of his dreams when he dreams of Coolgardie, but
the newest thing in masculine leg-wear was a pair
of black tights and black, close-fitting gaiters.
They looked as if the Attorney-General let out
his official garments on hire during the close
season. But those legs were an anachronism
on a horse—Providence manifestly intended ’em
for a bicycle. A number of men drove.
The opening of Parliament, on 14th inst., by
the Acting-Governor, who made his debut as a
speechifier from the Throne on that occasion, was
not so effective as usual owing to the finery being
at half-pressure, because of the absence of Simon
Pure vice-royalty. Acting-Gov. Darley, in a tight
blue uniform with brass buttons and a cocked hat
devoid of plumage, suggested a glorified police-
man, but he laid down the political programme
with great art, in an almost indistinct voice
which was altogether en suite with the subject-
matter. Parliament set a-movin’ by the Acting-
Gov. is like a rooster without his tail feathers.
Splendor is infectious; but when tiie Throne
merely suggests the “foorce,” legislators who
ought to sport warpaint taper off to morning
dress without disturbing the eternal fitness. So
there wasn’t much of a peepshow for the crowd of
women assembled (with the Acting-Governoress
in a pink bonnet in the van), except, pirhaps, the
ballet legs of one or two high officials in black
stockings, which lent an air of burlesque to the
proceedings. Another entertaining feature was
the good-looking A. V.R. secretary in full evening-
dress, standing motionless against the crimson
background behind the Throne, His petrified
pose with the Speech in one hand suggested a per-
son undergoing the worst form of photography.
However, the opening deserves some fame as
being the only public gathering of any importance
at which the Gee-Gees were not represented.
The Enriquez benefit-concert, tendered by
friends and admirers, came off at Sydney Cen-
tenary Hull, on 14th inst., with the indefatigable
acting-Governoress in a pink cloak, a daughter or
so, and an obviously bored aide-de-camp, under
the close surveillance of an audience which didn't
nearly fill the hall. Ihe ben. was not a success
financially, although the programme was very well
compiled—the contralto being down for four num-
bers without prejudice to possible encores, while
Alias Colborne-Baber (handsomely gowned in
yellow brocade), Madame Kellermann (in green
velvet and striped silk), Mr. Frank Adams, Dr.
Maguire, a tuneful bevy from theLiedertafel, Mr.
Donovan, Edgar ’cello Strauss, and Alons. Pou«-
sard were all actively concerned in the programme.
The platform was neatly decorated with pot*
plants draped in danger-signals, and bouquet*
went up by the barrow-load. The only weakness
lay in the takings.
One of Madame Enriquez’ items (she was
gowned in white brocade, by the way, with sacri-
ficial garlands of scarlet roses and a most
display of diamonds) was a song by Dr. AlcCarthjr
entitled “Still Apart.” I couldn't hear the
words, but the whole thing was too long. With a
few bars added it would have made a very re-
spectable cantata, but, regarded as a song, it
decidedly howls for condensation. The refrain,
too, is distinctly joyous, suggesting that the singer
doesn’t particularly object to the separation. You
picture the title-page as bearing the legend “Still
Apart, thankfully dedicated to my mother-in-
law.” Aliss Col bourne Baber was encored for her
solo—an “ Ave Maria,” with organ and ’cello
obligati—to which she responded; but Dr. Alaguire,
of the suave and polished baritone, refused a triple
encore for his refined singing of a Verdi recit.
and aria. J. E. Sykes and Harrison White were
accompanists-in-general. Apropos of concerts, a
very big one, under vice-vice-regal patronage, is
now on the carpet, to be held in the Town Hall
in .aid of the Boys’ Brigade. Taking it “by and
large,” Sydney professional musicians have no
reason to complain of a lack of opportunity to
exhibit the result of their hard work—gratis.
Sydney Theosophists would not seem to be a
very ’thusiastic handful, considering how sparsely
the Countess of Wachtmeister’s at home on Satur-
day* at the Theo. Society’s rooms, was attended.
The function suggested a number of patients
chumming in to while away the time in a doctor’s
waiting-room—an idea which the frankly dreary
surroundings, rigid pictures, hard-and-fast tables
without covers, and no airy ornaments—distinctly
encouraged. However, if Theosophy is not a beau-
tifully-furnished religion, it has at least the
wondrous power of making its male disciples very
handy about the house, so to speak. At the
reception on Saturday tea was altogether mani-
pulated by the “ brothers’’—the women sitting
round and enjoying the spectacle of men, who
never do more than trot round with the served
beverage, peering into the tea-pot and deciding
the vexed question as to whether the mixture
would stand dilution or not —quite d la hostess.
A Theosophist would apparently make an ideal
husband for the woman who likes a cup of tea
before rising.
But, though the company was decidedly flabby
and inert—having to be entertained in sections by
the Countess, or the good-looking he-secretary, in
the orthodox Theospphical murmur—the thing
was worth while, because Countess Wachtmeister
is a most charming woman. I do not mean it
physically ; nobody could be Venus with mouse-
colored hair, drawn tightly back from the fore-
head, and fastened in a bathroom sort of bob at
the back—a plainly-made dress of black-figured
stuff—no white collar, and a tiny Theosophical
brooch. Rings, of course, though not so numerous
or so fantastic as Annie B-sant’s— but Countess
W. owes little of her charm to her get-up. Her
voice and manner are her strong points. She
suggests Annie Besant under the influence of
morphia, for her style is dreamier than that of the
lady with the chameleonic hair, though her facts
and figures are just as wide-awake. Her style
suggests bullets wrapped in wadding.
I had a little gossip with Mr. John Alarqnardt
—celebrated as a violinist—and Aline. Breitsohuck-
Alarqnardt—equally renowned ns a performer on
that celestial instrument, the harp—at their hotel
the other morning. Madame is a good-looking
brunette (somewhat reminiscent of Italia del
Torre) who wears her hair in a Venus knot, and
has her taper fingers covered with diamond rings.
The harp has not spoilt the shape of her finger-
tips, because inadame possesses the gift of a
dry hand, without which harping is a vain
thing. Her favorite composer is, of course.
Parish Alvars, the “ Beethoven of the harp”
—the sweetest instrument in the world in the hands
of an artist, and one of which ’ Australia has but
a single considerable exponent up-to-date—John
Barker, of Alelbourne. Air. Alarqnardt looks
more like an operatic tenor than a violinist, but
his musical style is evidently not so fierce as his
moustache, his average being one burst fiddle-
string to three concerts, Churubill Orton manages
the tour, which starts at the Town Hall on Satur-
day.
From W, 11. Paling and Co. I have received a
copy of the Zarita waltz, by Sara E. Bear. The
Zanta is a tinkly waltz, suggestive of tambourines
and cymbals—all ouite in accordance with the
Eastern-looking title-page, (nit there really is no
special reason (considering the state of the waltz-
market) why the composer should have hastened
to introduce Zarita to a weary public. Another
new thing is a “Dance of Dryads,” arranged for
piano from the S. A.O S. fantasia, “Night in the
Forest”—by C. S. Childe, It is a valiant effort
in a smallpox cover, proving that the able-bodied
person with strong fists may make almost ss much
noise as a whole orchestra, if you show him the
way, and, in competent hands, the Dance (even
Dryads dance in 3-4 time, alas !) would he a very
taking thing in fantasias. It is not difficult—
airily speaking. Occasionally the ground-plan
suggests aChine.se battle, hut fantasias are always
built that way. I have also received a copy of
“Still Apart,” the song by Dr. McCarthy, men-
tioned above as sung by Madame Enriquez. The
maudlin words are by Arthur Rigby ; and yon
would never dream, judging from “ Still Apart,”
what an exceptionally gifted musician Dr.
AlcCarthy occasionally is, /
I think'the most astonishing thing about the
recent dreadful missionary-massacres in China is
that the Chinese included the missionesses in the
butcher’s bill, for there always seems to be so
much cordial feeling between Chiiiamanee and
E ilopean miasee—outside China,'at least. IndeFd,
no main of the world would ever allow his woman-
kind to have anything whatsoever to do with
Chinamen. The experience of society in San
Francisco, where Chinamen are numerous and
many well-educated women have* engaged in their
“conversion,” is that, in an enormous percentage
of eases, the pious pow- wow ends with the well-
meaning woman going wrong with the yellow-skin
—and even in Sydney the fatal; fascinations of
Flowery Land beaux are not absolutely unfelt.
In a Southern suburb a good-looking, well-
educated girl—the daughter of eminently respect-
able people—is engaged to be married to a howling
heathen from the land of tea, and appears to quite
glory in the fact, despite the remonstrances of her
circle—who are probably jealous of her. The case
instanced in “The Gaiety Girl,” of the poor
woman “who fell in love with a stockbroker,” is
a mere nothing to this, though, when yon come to
look at it, the thing isn't so very wonderful.
Women adore politeness and suavity, and the
graceful insight into feminine nature which
teaches John to mark his cabbage above market-
rates soi as to give bis fair customers the pleasure
of beating him down to his own price, shows a
keen appreciation of onr sex which ramifies far
beyond mere vegetable-barter. Let every woman
ask herself in her heart of hearts whether she
likes her vegetable John or not. I’ll bet a cabbage
what her answer will be.
But it isn’t altogether wonderful that women
should be so hypnotised if they once get on visit-
ing-tenns—religious or not —with Nanki - Poo.
Really, when you come to contrast their appear-
ance, at any rate, there isn’t so very much differ-
ence between a Chinaman and an average British
naval officer—now, is there ? Both are clean-
shaven and tan-skinned—both exercise an in-
describable and somewhat unaccountable attrac-
tion for the fair sex. No man of the world would
allow his women-folk to start a society for the
conversion of naval officers, involving frequent
visits on board for prayer and expostulation, any
more than he would for the conversion of Ah Sin.
That most benevolent and popular clergyman,
the Rev. A. H. Bartlett (Phil May’s parson-model
for the bewildered cleric in “the Parson and the
Painter,” who went round London and Paris
together in a shower of brilliant sketches), lias
lately been presented by his adoring Burwood
(Sydney) congregation with several farewell gifts,
ranging from a reading-lamp to a silver match-
box. A handsome diamond bracelet was also pro-
vided for madame. It was a wicked thing for
Phil May to use the Burwood clergyman as a
model in such a connection, for M. Bartlett is, in
the very best sense of the word, a model parson.
Brisbane is bis new sphere.
My Melbourne correspondent :—A lately-im-
ported official matron, who ran the gauntlet of
popular curiosity at her initial receptions, and was
visited by pretty nearly everyone, atoned for it
afterwards by the “fun” she derived from the
process of “returning the calls.” No visitor was
too obscure to escape detection ; she unearthed
them all, enthroned in her State carriage and
attended by lackeys, who sniffed scornfully at the
poky villas and doublefrontage cottages “dis-
covered ” cn route. The doors were opened in
many cases by the hostess herself, hot from the
ironing-table or redolent of cookery, and—but
■details would be too harrowing.
“A late BULLETIN ‘par.,’ describing Miss
Maggie Sterling, Melbourne’s popular mezzo-
soprano, as a ‘ handsome copy of Lady Hope-
tonn ’is a little misleading. The resemblance is
striking, certainly, though the singer, lacking her
ex-Exoellency’s warm, brown complexion, suggests,
irather, a p illid, pensive, eld r sister —which is not
to be wondered at, considering that her beautiful
Yoice is the sole support of her invalid husband
and three young children.
“ A recent lecture, abounding in reminiscences,
rank and racy, still sticks in the throats of its
hearers. The chairman, a legal authority, young,
ingenuous and pretty, apparently felt his position
keenly at the time; and ever since he has been
bombarded with letters from infuriated purists,
Avho henceforth will doubtless regard him with
suspicion as a menace to the morality of the com-
munity. •
“Other sufferers from the spiciness of the lecture
are those unfortunates who, unsuspectingly, ob-
tamed invitations for serious acquaintances. One
such victim, publicly reproved for Ids ‘ low-down
conduct,’ was finally laid out by the remark,
‘ And you a member of Mr. Chancel’s church 1 ’
“The prettiest girl at the recent Cliveden ‘at
home ’ was, I thought, the daughter of the house
—tall, fair and graceful, in a white silk crepon ;
tieing for second place came two sisters, the
younger of whom was one of the debutantes at
the last Govt. House ball. These young ladies,
relatives of a well-known dentist, wore silver-
sprigged white brocade, and silvery aigrettes and
.shoulder-straps. Melbourne's leading military
dame was conspicuous in a Satanic toilette of
scarlet, with upstanding black wings in her hair.
“It would be hard to foretell the result of a
local competition for a vacant pro-consulship,
but could the position of vice-regal ‘leading
lady’ be contested ‘on its own,’ Cliveden’s
sprightly mistress would probably head the
poll. Unlike many of their imported lady-
ships, whose society demeanour, as often as not,
suggests an urchin commanded to ‘ look plea-
sant ’ {immediately after a spanking, smiles and
small talk come naturally to her. At the concert,
the other evening, there were few who did not
envy her convenient knack of spontaneous
laughter, smoothing over, as it did, the otherwise
chilling reception of a series of society sketches,
which would have been hopelessly behind the times
10 years ago. The impersonation of the little
girl, reciting the ‘ Psalm of Life’ in a shy, sing-
song gabble, was especially out of date, present-
day youngsters, stagey in picture-frocks and
fluffed hair, would scorn sucb a railk-and-watery
performance, preferring to rave and tear through
a dramatic selection like Owen Meredith’s ‘Por-
trait,’ airing their ‘society English’ in such
lines as
Oit, Ood ! 'twas the Raphael-faced young priest
Who shraved her when she da-ed 1
“Early Victorian fashions, 'tis said, conduce tc
modesty, because, minus the support of a shoulder-
strap, the bodice must be cut within hail of the
collar-bone to keep up at all. At a recent fashion-
able assemblage, however, a mature, upper-crusiy
spinster, equally devoted to society junketings
and good works, though up-to-date as far as
sleeves were concerned, was nevertheless quite her
old self, her ‘lB3o’ bodice strongly re-
sembling a small riding-corset in bright blue
satin.
Yours affectionately,

SPOUTING NOTIONS.
Murray Smith boasted in the Vic, tote-debate
that he had put this poser to the racina men who had
canvassed him on behalf of the machine: “ What is th••
difference between the loialisalor and Monte Carlo?”
Murray Smith might a>k what is the difference between
himself and the greatest drunkard on earth ?-they both
drink. What is the difference between a suicide-club and
an art-union ? it is a toss-up in each case. What is the

Chinese lottery-ticket? What is the difference between
Freetrade and robbery-nnder-aiins? What is tire differ-
ence between a liar and a novelist and a lawyer and a

difference between a gambling-machine which pla.i g fair

and a saturnalia of gambling which lasts day and night

Ikey Mo was a fair goer on the eve of the tote
debate in V'ic. Assembly, llis precious Sportsman, and
its blond relation the ’Kralu, pelted the coining Bill with
dead-pat arguments in all stages of putrefaction. The
voice of Ikey’s own particular special pleader, and the
snuffle of many a nobbled parson, could he heard through-
out the I mil. Ikey himself worked like a Jew possessed; ’
plying Councillors with further instructions to stand firm
when the Bill reached the Unpp reuse, rushing round to
hotel-keepers and exhorting ihem to preach the awful
“ immorality ” of the hlankv appa at ns to every customer,
and borrowing, perhaps, the key of the Synagogue that
he might go within and pray hard for the tote’s discom-
fiture. Melbourne, Bendigo, and Ballarat had never
before known so much Ikey in the air as they experienced
last week. The immortal soul of !. Moses seemed to he
hovering overhead like an angry crow that sees its carrion
in danger, and one could almost hear the evil spirit flap-
ping a black wing against a black hag and sereeihing,
“In the name of ehurch morality, let me live on! ” at. the
moment when 35 members of the Assembly fluttered 49
farcical petitions, signed by 2000 publicans and parsons
in all, against the Legislative sanctioning of Ikey’s exter-
mination.

Although Purves, Q. 0., is a professed convert
to the “ tote,” he objected to the V.R.O. taking a voce
by ballot on the question of Machine o. Ikey Mo. He
aouldn’t see any occasion for a secret vote—which merely
oroves several things. There were a good many members
□resent who thought it advisable-Purves having carried
Eis point-to hold up their hands against the tote,
whereas they would have voted for it secretly^
Frank Madden repeated his former indiscretion
when the Tote Bill came before the Vic. Assembly. He
made another speech. If Franky could preserve a dense
dlence upon the tote subject Ins vote might carry a lot
af weight, but every sentence he utters takes 71b. oft its
hack so to speak. The lamentable Madden opposed the
SS on two grounds first, because it would encourage
.„d increase gambling to an enormous extent, and,
jecondly, because it would ruin the breeding of horses,
for which the province is so well suited. EUewliere in
this painful person’s doctrine it is recorded that the
public constitute a milch cow, from whose udders the
natural liquid food of “sport” is naturally drawn by be-
lewelled Hebrew fingers, whilst horse-breeding is maim
[aim dby the sport. Therefore, an enormous increase in
the supply of milk, two-thirds of which would go to
increase racing-stakes, instead of increasing the circum-
ference of Ikey Mo., would ruin the breeding of horses.
The bookies expected the Vic. Labor-members
co oppose the legalisation of the tote. “ Vy, my tear

After the 25 to 5 defeat of the Victorian Rugby
team by the Northern Union, the return match against
va vv at Sydney Cricket Ground last Saturday, had a
foregone conclusion. The Vies, began with a strong wind
behind them, but could take not the least advantage of it,
for none of their backs can kick at all. Their forwards
played fairly until they got near the N.S.W. hne, and then
they went to pieces. Moreover, they passed badly, and
seemed to have a mania for dribbling. With half-time
NSW. had scored 6 to 0. In the interval the [Sydney
Bi'cvole Club’s Three-Mile handicap was easily won by the
scratch man, Macdonald; five or six riders fell towards
the fl"Uh, one breaking his collar-bone. The Rugby
“match ” in the second half, degenerated into a scramble,
none of’the N.S.W. men taking it seriously except
MacMahon, who heavily grassed a couple of the Victorians.
N.S.W. won by 19 to 5.
* * * *
The return football-match between Queensland
and N.S.W. brought a surprising win for N.S.V\ by 11 to
8 : the previous Saturday Q. had won by 26 to 16. the
n’s W forwards played with combined aggression, and
both their tries in the first half were obtained by passing
rushes. With the first 15 minutes of the second half the
crowd’s excitement reached its height, for the Queens-
landers had made scores equal. But from that out
N S W., continually pressing upon its opponents, had the
game fairly in hand, and won more comfortably than is
inferable from the scores.
* • * *
About the best Vic. football of the season was
played in the Geelong v. Essendon match on Saturday,
both teams keeping at concert pilch throughout. Essen-
dons were superior to their opponents, except during one
quarter when Geelong put on 5 goals (3 kicked by Deceit)
in 12 minutes. Esaendonsovershadowed and played their
rivals to a standstill in the last quarter, and with ten
minutes mere would certainly have won.
* * * *
Geelong, provided they don’t go to pieces in the
meantime, seem “dead birds” for the Vic. premiership.
Although Fitzroy beat Melh, on Saturday, either team is
outclassed by Essendon or Geelong. Fitzroy s four uoals
to two against Melb. is a fair play criterion of that par-
ticular match, hut not of the teams. As a matter of fact,
Melh. men were in such a mediocre level that great
difficulty was experienced on finding the winner of Kelly
Bros.' trophy for the best Melb. player.
The racy-looking M.L. Maxim colt, Mann-
licber, promises to start first favorite for the A.J.U
Derby. After arrival, he was placed on the same betting-
mark as Bob Ray-at fours to one. The only thing against
Mannlioher is that he won’t be really three years old
until the end of Nov., being a late foal.

Secretary Tom Furse is again “the man
at tl e helm ” for this year’s demonstration ot
Labor at Sydney. In another column he sets
forth the manifold advantages of buying a tick* t,
which not only admits to the gala to be held at,
Rosehill on Oct. 7, but gives the holder a chance
of landing one of the many Art Union prizes, the
first and richest of which is .£5OO, or equiva-
lent. The trading public are responding well to
the call for subscriptions in cash and trophies, and
the prizedist in the sports departments is the
heaviest yet set out. A novel and soul-satisfying
attraction will be the grand-band contest, for
which the first prize is .£5O, the second .£3O, and
the third .£lO. Ten bands must enter or there
will be no race, and with ten bands doing battle
there ought to be noise and fury enough to scare
the obstructing devils out of seven counties. Mr.
Furse is a steam-engine of unlimited horsepower,
and he means to make this year s turn-out a
record. *

READ WHAT
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
did for the Invalid Daughter of a Prom-
inent Lowell Tradesman.
“My daughter had for a long time been
troubled with violent headaches and sleep-
lessness. She was pale, had no appetite,
and was losing flesh rapidly. She took
various remedies for her trouble,’but re-
ceived no benefit until she commenced using
-•
Ayer’S Sarsaparilla. After taking half a
bottle she began to feel better. By a con-
tJi.V’o 1 '! se ()1 , llll , s medicine, her appetite re-
turned, her cheeks began to fill out and show
color, she gained in strength, her headaches
disappeared, she slept better, and now says
she teels like a new person.”— F. F. Cooofs-
hau, G Lyon St., Lowell.

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys lias derived from
‘Bengers Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
wo should never be able to
rear her. Wo took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ' Benger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
“If every mother knew of
its value no other would be
used.”
The chemists to the Sanitary Commission-
ers of India have been investigating alleged snake-
poison antidotes. They report that strychnine
has no power whatever when even the minimum
fata! dose is given ; paralysis of the lungs and
other usual symptoms always following. Solution
of periodate crystals, the South American fancy
article, is also alleged to be absolutely useless :
ditto chloride of gold; ditto permanganate of
potash. But, so far as strychnine is concerned,
Ur. Mueller’s experiments had just the opposite
result ; and there are now many recorded Austra-
lian cases of snake-bite cured by strychnine-injec-
tion, while in few or none has the treatment failed
when adopted at once.
A firm of bacon-curers from London is
starting a branch establishment at Lilydale (Vic.),
and has begun to introduce the “mild cure” of
V ictorian bacon to notice. An export-trade is
the principal end in view, but the mild cure seems
likely to suit the local consumer. Bacon which
presents “a juicy appearance when freshly cut,
and will be found much less salty than most Aus-
tralian bacon,”is a very desirable article for these
parts, where the old, strong, tough kind of curing
lias been carried to an extreme. Mr. Veoht, the
manager of the “London Mild Bacon Curing Co.”
thinks that his new system—or, rather, the old-
established system which he is introducing to
Australia—will be generally adopted by the trade
here as soon as its merits become known.
ENO’S “ FRUIT SALT ” (oneof Nature’s own
products) keeps the blood pure, and is thus of
itself oneof the most valuable means of keeping
the blood free from fevers and blood poisons, liver
complaints, See., ever discovered. As a means of
preserving and restoring health it is unequalled :
and it is, moreover, a pleasant, refreshing and in-
vigorating beverage. After a patient and careful
observation of its effects when used, I have no
hesitation in stating that if its great value in keep-
ing the body healthy were universallj' known, not
a household in the land would be without it, nor a
single travelling trunk or portmanteau but would
contain it.— J. 0. Eno. Sold by all Chemists and
Stores.*
Melbourne suburbs have been infested
with ghosts recently, couples out taking the night
air being particularly troubled. A touching tale
comes from Albert Park. Two young people were
sitting up in the moonlight affording each other
encouragement and support, when a dreadful shape
ioomed up out of the shadow of an adjacent tree
and was about to grin horribly when the young
man went over the seat backwards, picked him-
self up, and fled through the night. He collected
all his relations and called in the assistance of the
police, and the army went back to the rescue of
the girl. The party approached the scene of
horror very gradually and found the young woman
nestling her curly head up against the bosom of
the spook, collected in the spectre’s arms, and
quite composed. “It” was the other fellow, and
he retains possession.
A Bulletin man who happens to have no
objections to meeting his tailor just now, re-
cently received the confidence of a Melb. snip
seeking sympathy. “See that dress-suit?” asked
the vulgar fraction mournfully. “ Any man with
half an eye can tell it’s been worn. I made it to
the order of a man here who was once a luminary
in Oollins-street. It was delivered the night
before the last reception at Government House,
and returned the evening after, with Mr. Blank’s
compliments, and Mr. Blank would see me hanged
before he’d wear a suit that fitted him like a
sugar-bag on a fence-rail. No further explana-
tions beyond a pretty unconscionable hint that
Blank wasn’t worth going for.” But the man of
threads and patches is certain that suit was at
Government House, and has still hopes of it going
off with judicious pressing.

Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir _l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous'System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper or
this. Wishing yon every success,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 2o
years ago. I can with great recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHJNJvhAY.

into the lungs. Experience has how proved that those suffering from Asthma,
Bronchitis, Difficulty of Breathing, Miner’s Complaint, Bad Coughs, or any affec-
tions of the Chest and Lungs should not be without one of these Inhalers, as they

‘ THE LAST OF SIX.
The frequency and unction with which Mr.
Greer’s N.S.W. Labor Bureau delivers itself of
the report, “ The men sent into the country show a
high sense of their appreciation of the Bureau’s
services by remitting so promptly the cost of their
fare to their place of destination,” makes it neces-
sary to ask this question : “Does the Bureau send
a note marked ‘ private ’ to the employers of the
men so despatched, requesting that the money
spent by the Bureau shall bestopped from the first
or the early payments of the men, and forwarded
to Sydney?” Are such notes—marked private—
to be found up Narrabri way, and have there been
cases in which the whole of a man’s pay has been
stopped until the Bureau account was satisfied ?
A London paper, on Cowen’s new opera,
says : “The subject of King Harold, the last of
the Saxons, is essentially national, though neces-
sarily Englishmen must regard the subjugation
of our country by William of Normandy with
mixed feelings.” Even if “our country” means
Hingland, quite apart from the rest of Great
Britain, the remark is absurd enough. Norman
blood has circulated everywhere, and the people
who have avoided getting any of it into their
families, are probably Danish or Norwegian rather
than Saxon by descent. And, whatever their real
pedigree may be, they are always prepared to hug
the notion that at least one of their ancestors
came over with the Conqueror. Their feelings, if
they had any in the matter, would prompt them
to witness the collapse of Harold with a haughty
smile.
The result of the Opium Commission
(British Parliament) deliberations is startling and
of much interest to Australians. As regards the
advisability of prohibition the verdict was unani-
mously “No !’’ The Commission also found that
the people of India were totally unwilling to have
the drug prohibited and totally unwilling to bear
the cost of prohibition The most interesting
part of the report was that bearing on the effect
of the consumption of opium on the moral and
physical well-being of the people. A vast majority
of the witnesses declared the use of the drug in
moderation innocuous, and only its excess—bad.
It was the common domestic medicine of the
people. Opium (it was asserted) is the common
cure for malarial fever, dysentery and endemic
diarrhoea, and an eminent medical authority, Sir
William Roberts, maintains its efficacy. Accor-
ding to Roberts the anarcotine present in opium
is superior to quinine as an antiseptic. Witnesses
appeared who had eaten opium for 15 and 25 years
and had found it had done them good. The
hardiest races in India patronise it. (By the
way, opium-eater De Quincey lived to the
age of 74). Medical authorities testified to the
Commission that the use of alcohol was far more
injurious than the use of opium, and, generally
speaking, advised John Bull to reform his own
drunken habits before meddling with the compara-
tively harmless customs of Asiatics.
Dear Bulletin,— N.S.W. Local Option
League is anguished because N.S.W. has spent
<£45,000,000 in liquor during the last 10 years.
Well, what of it? There’s over a million people
in N.S.W. I’ll make the L.O. League a present
of. the hundreds of thousands of surplus, and am
willing, as far as I am concerned, to admit my
responsibility as one individual in a bare million.
And what is that for 10 years ? Why, a paltry
! Not enough to have got a teetotal mis-
sionary an outfit to China ! And in 10 years,
mark you : only £4 10s, a year ! Great ginger-
pop ! what does the Local Option League want?
There were two leap years in the decade ’B5-94
(inclusive). Therefore, there were 3652 days—
mostly of megrims and misery, only for the “oil ”
of gladness. Now, if I spent only 3d. per day
(Sundaysand holidays included) in that which both
cheereth and inebriateth, look you, I would have
spent 10,956 d., or £45 13s. Does the league
begrudge me one thripenny fusel oil a day ?
Perhaps they want me to make a margin for
infants? Well, let us suppose three-quarters of
the population of N.S.W. are too young, too
moral, too weak, or too otherwise unfit to swill
bug-juice. That leaves 45 millions sterling worth
of grog to be drunk and paid for by a quarter of a
million of people during 10 years. What is that?
=£45,000,000 between 250,000 people is only <£lBo
per head. And that is spread over 10 years. ,£lB
a year ! Not quite Is. a day ! Not four nips a
day ! Why, we are a sober nation, and I feel
ashamed of myself! If I had, however, saved
this shilling a day and put £lBO into the Christian
Providential Lord willprovide Building and Invest-
ment Society, would its pious reconstructing
directors now give me a shilling a day to chant
“ Amen ” to their “ Alleluias ? ” Mind you, the
£45,000,000 are their own figures, these local
option leaguers. So you see that the Curse of
Derrink is a bogey, and is to the Local Option
League what Mrs. Mellon’s spooks were to Judge
Windeyer.—Yours, The Dipsomaniac.

“ HOMOCEA ” CURES EVERYTHING.
LORD CARRICK says Homocea cured him of
bleeding piles, when all else failed ; that he gave
some to a labourer who was lamed by a stone
falling upon him, whom it cured. A woman had
a pain in the elbow and could not bend it for a
year, and it cured her, and another used it for
scurvy on her leg, and it was doing her good —one
letter closes from him with the words, “It is the
most wonderful stuff that I ever came across."
LADY VINCENT, 8, Ebury Street, London,
says : “ Homocea is such an incomparable appli-
cation for Rheumatic Neuralgia, that she wishes
to have two more tins sent.”
LORD COMBERMERE says Homocea did
him more good than any embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.

to be the most soothing

that I could possibly
have for my fractured
limb, as it seems to
'retain longer than any
other, that oleaginous-
ness so requisite for
perfect and efficient

embrocations generally
is that they harden and

yours, besides being particularly aromatic, is as
soft as oil, and almost instantly mollifying in the
case of severe inflammation.

The Aborigines and Their Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Recently Mr. H. J. M‘Cooey queried in
The Bulletin “How used N.S.W. aborigines to
bury their dead ? ” Here are a few notes
drawn from many sources. Eleven modes of
disposing of the dead were in use among the
Australian aborigines, to wit, (a) cremation, (6)
burial in the bed of a running stream, (c), suspen-
sion across the limb of a tree, (d) exposure on a
staging among branches of a tree, (e) enclosure in
a cave, (/) exposure on an artificial staging raised
on stakes, (g) burial in a disused mirrn-yong or
ash-heap, ( h) burial in the earth, ( i ) burial with
others in a stone-lined trench, (j) cannibal con-
sumption by relatives, ( k ) exposure on surface of
ground. By almost every tribe employing burial
the body was tied up into a sort of ball, with the
knees tucked up to the chin, and buried in a
squatting posture with the face to the east ; to
avoid useless repetition, therefore, only variations
from this practice will be noticed. Names of
authorities are in parentheses.
* * •
Near Perth, W.A., a grave was dug just
large enough for the body, the white sand placed
at the east and west ends, and the discolored sand
at the sides ; the corpse was wrapped in a rug, and
the grave filled up with small boughs; large
branches were laid across, and the dirty sand piled
into a mound on top (Grey). On the Vasse River,
the corpse was smeared with blood from the
mourners’ thighs and buried as near Perth, but a
hut was afterwards built over the grave (Bussell).
Near York, W. A., the Whajook tribe cut off the
hair and burned off the nails of the dead, and after
burial raised a mound over the grave, into which
green boughs and deceased’s weapons were stuck
(Goldsworthy). In the same district the Ballin-
dong natives fill up the grave with alternate layers
of bark and earth (Hackett). Ninety miles north
of Albany, among the Kojonnp and Bticup, the
thumb-nails were burned off, the right forefinger
and thumb tied together, and thegrave was filled up
with bark, &c., the dug-up earth never being re-
turned (Graham). Near King George’s Sound,
the grave was short, narrow and shallow, the body
surrounded and covered with leaves and twigs,
the grave filled up with earth and covered
with a mound, into which boughs and veapons
were stuck ; a fire was lighted at the foot, and
circles were cut on adjacent trees (Scott Nind).
Near Eyre’s Sand-patch, i.e., from Point Culver
for 150 miles eastward and for 40 miles inland, the
dead were simply laid on the ground with the
head to the east; a little food was placed near the
right hand, and a small tire lighted near by
(Williams).
* * #
Near Port Lincoln, S.A., in Eyre’s Penin-
sula, the body was buried on its back with the
knees drawn up, covered with kangaroo skin;
stakes were placed across the grave, on which
earth was piled, and a fence of boughs was placed
around (Wilhelmi). In Yorke’s Peninsula, the
dead were shoved into old wombat holes (Fowler).
On the shores of Encounter Bay, children still-
born or killed at birth were burned, but other dead
children were packed up, carried by the mother
by day and used as her pillow at night for months,
then exposed on a tree till the bones were cleaned,
when they were buried. Bodies of grown men
were placed in the sun between two fires till the
loosened skin could be peeled off; after flaying,
the openings of the body were sewn up, the body
greased and red-ochred, and placed, with face to
the east and arms extended on a raised platform
over a slow fire till dry ; the smoked remains were
carried about for mouths. Finally, the trunk and
limbs were left on another raised stage to decay,
but the skull, when cleaned up, was utilised by
the next of kin as a drinking vessel (Meyer).
Sometimes, bodies were placed in a tree to decay
(Davis). Along the coast, from the Murray Lakes
to Lacepede Bay, the Narrinyerri sometimes
burned children, sometimes buried them, but dead
warriors were dealt with as at Encounter Bay
(Taplin). On the east shore of Lake Torrens, the
dying were waddied to death, and the fat and tit-
bits cooked and eaten (Gason). In the country of
the Dieri, bordered by Cooper’s Creek on the
north, and a line from Freeling heights to Depot
Glen on the south, after the body was lowered
into the grave, a non-relative jumped in, cut off
all the fat from the face, thighs, arms, and
stomach, and deceased’s kin ate it; the grave was
surmounted by a pile of wood, food was placed
near by, and fires lighted round about (Gason).
Just north of Depot Glen the corpse was smeared
with gypsum before burial (Webster).
• * *
At Port Darwin (N.T.), among the Larrakia
tribe, warriors were either buried at once, or the
body was tied up in the branches of a tree till the
flesh rotted off and the bones fell to the ground; the
bones were then buried (Foelsche). At Raffles
Bay, on Coburg Peninsula, women and children
were promptly buried without ceremony ; but
dead warriors were wrapped in grass and sus-
pended from a branch till the flesh rotted off and
the bones fell to the ground ; the bones were then
collected, painted red, carried about for months,
and finally buried near deceased’s birthplace
(Foelsche). In some parts of Arnheim’s Land
bodies of warriors were exhumed after being
buried for five days, wrapped in bark and carried
about by the kin (Duncan).
* • «
On the Cloncurry, Q., the Miappe tribe
cooked their dead in a trench lined with heated
stones and filled in with hot embers, and the
adults ate the baked body (Curr). Between the
Cloncurry and the Flinders the dead were some-
times eaten, sometimes buried beneath a mound
covered with logs and boughs (M'Gillivray). On
the Granite Range, a few miles inland from
Cairns, the dead were either eaten or else tied up
in ti-tree bark and buried (Mowbray). Round
Halifax Bay, the body was eaten (Johnstone).
On the head-waters of the Burdekin children were
eaten by their distant kin, women and old men
buried without ceremony, and warriors placed on
stages in trees. In the Townsville district a large
fire was made over the grave (Johnstone). At
Mt. Elliott, just south of Townsville, the dead
were eaten by their kin (Gregory). Round Mary-
borough male corpses were skinned, dried, carried
for mouths, then buried (M'Pherson). Between
Brisbane and Gympie the Mooloola tribe skinned
the corpse, ate the flesh, and placed the bones in
a tree (Westaway). On Great Sandy (Fraser’s)
Island young men and fat young women
were eaten; a dead warrior’s skin an 1 bones
were dried and divided among lus rela-
tives; sometimes bodies were burn <1 and
the ashes carried about (Police D pi.); or
the body was buried in its rugs (Fison); or, if the
corpse was that of a young man, it was skinned,
the flesh being dried in lumps and the marrow ex-
tracted from the bone, thereafter the parts were
carried till stale, then placed on a stage in a tree
(Fison); occasionally the complete body was
placed in a tree (Fison). At the source of the
Mary River, the Kabi tribe ate the flesh, buried
the large bones under a log-pile, and kept the
small bones as relics (Mathew). On Stradbroke
and Moreton Island burial was the rule (Watkin).
Between Hughenden and the head of the Cape
River, the Mungerra tribe buried in shallow
graves (Armstrong). At Natal Downs fat men
accidentally killed were eaten, boys, girls and
women burnt; the internal organs of a warrior
were buried separately from the body proper,
which was exhumed at the end of a month, when
the skull and bones were cleaned, placed on a
stage in a tree, taken down three months later,
and carried about by the female relatives till they
tired of them (Chattield). In the district enclosed
by Natal Downs, Elgin Downs, Bowen Downs
and Tower Hill the accidentally-killed were eaten
and their bones buried ; old women were burned
and their ashes buried ; old men were raised on a
stage five feet high for three days, then wrapped
in ti-tree bark and buried beneath a log-pile ;
when decay was complete, the bones were carried
for a time, then dropped into a hollow tree
(M'Glashan). On the Belyando, a warrior’s corpse
was buried for two months, exhumed, chopped up,
wrapped in bark, carried by female relatives till the
death was avenged, then dropped into a hollow tree;
women were buried off-hand (Muirhead). At Peak
Downs the widow carried her husband’s remains
for months before burying them (Murray). At
the headwaters of the Burke, the flesh was eaten
and the bones buried (Eglinton); also here and
there on the Herbert (Maohattie). On the Dia-
mantina and the Herbert, many tribes dug a grave
with its long axis north and south, placed cane
grass on the bottom, and at sunrise laid the naked
corpse thereon at full length, covered it with grass
and filled up the grave with earth (Curr). At the
source of the Bareoo, males were buried for a time,
exhumed, carried in bark coffins for six months,
then re-buried (Hyde). At the junction of the
Thomson and Bareoo, the dead were buried in
sandhills (Heagney). In places in Cooper’s Greek
district, the young men dug a grave, while the
elders tied the corpse’s big toes together and the
hands behind the back ; the body was laid length-
wise in the grave, which was then filled with dead
wood and surmounted by a wood-pile (James).
Among the tribes between the Maranoa and Paroo,
the body was sometimes burned with its belong-
ings ; sometimes mummified, carried about, and
later placed in a hollow tree ; sometimes the hair
was cut off, the face painted with clay, and the
corjise then buried (Playfair).
* • •
In N.S.W., the Kamilaroi tribe on the
Barwan, Gwydir and Namoi rivers buried their
dead (Bucknell). On the Hunter, the Wonnarua
buried under a pile of logs (Miller). On the Bogan,
the natives had cemeteries resembling those of
Europeans, in which the graves were numerous
and the grounds ornamented, and they had
curved walks or tracks through them. One of
these cemeteries, Milmeridien, is thus described
by Major Mitchell: “This burial-ground was
a fairy-like spot, in the midst of a scrub of droop-
ing acacias. It was an extensive space, laid out
in little walks, which were narrow and smooth,
as if intended only for ‘spirits.’ All these ran in
gracefully curved lines, and enclosed the heaving
heaps of reddish earth, which contrasted finely
with the acacias and dark oasuarinas around.
Others, gilt with moss, shot far into the recesses
of the bush, where slight traces of still more
ancient graves proved the antiquity of these
simple but touching records of humanity. With
all our art we could do no more for the dead than
these poor savages had done.” Charles Reade
poetically describes the same place in chapter 70
of ‘‘lt is Never too Late to Mend.” Between
Bourke and the Paroo the corpse was buried forth-
with, and a little hut, in which was placed a
vessel of water, was built over the grave (Scriv-
ener). Round Bourke the dead were buried in the
sand-hills, above flood-mark, after impressive cere-
monies, blood from the head of the chief mourner
being sprinkled over the leaves in the bottom of
the grave before the body was put in (Teulon). On
the Darling the grave-mounds were covered with
branches, surrounded by a ditch and a fence of
dead limbs and branches (Mitchell). On the
Lachlan the graves were marked by high mounds,
around which were placed rude seats (Mitchell,
Oxley). On the Murrumbidgee and Murray
graves were covered with thatched huts (Mitchell).
At the junction of these two rivers the graves of
males were surrounded by double or triple low
ridges, a hut was erected over them, which was
burned after the death was avenged (Mitchell).
* * *
In Victoria, on the Delatite, Ovens,
Broken and King Rivers, the body was conveyed
to the deceased’s birthplace; if it were that of a
warrior it was burned and the bones placed in a
hollow tree or branch; in the case of a child, a
hollow branch was carefully cleaned out, and a
bed of leaves made, on which the body was laid
in a rude coffin of bark peeled from a sapling, and
the opening carefully plugged up ; married people
were burned (Smyth). The Goulburn blacks sank
a shaft five feet deep and then made a horizontal
drive at bottom about 3ft. long and 2ft. Gin. high ;
the body was placed on leaves in this drive, its
aperture closed with bark, the shaft tilled in with
earth, and a shield-shaped mound piled up at foot
end of grave and at right angles to it (Smyth).
In Central Victoria those who died of a loathsome
disease were burned; young, clean bodies were put
into a tree to decay and the bones afterwards
buried ; warriors, old men and doctors were buried
with much ceremony; in special cases the grave
was covered in with boughs and fenced round
with stakes (Stanbridge). In Southern Vic-
toria there were no cemeteries; a warrior had
his rugs, weapons, Ac., buried with him in
a grave covered with a large mound and fenced in
with boughs; women and children were buried
unceremoniously except that a fire was lit close to
the mound; in the case of a young girl the fire
was on top of the mound (Smyth). The Barra-
bool blacks near Geelong stuck a fighting stick at
the east end of a young man’s grave (Smyth).
* * *
In Tasmania the body was placed upright
in a hollow tree, left for 12 months to decay, and
then burned, except the skull, which was carried
to a sort of savage Calvary, and there left in the
place of skulls (Davies); sometimes the dead were
burned, sometimes buried, sometimes thrown into
a natural hole and covered with leaves and rubbish
(Milligan).

The Three Friends of Uhomotu.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The white trader of Uhomotu came to his
door and looked seawards at the smoky haze
which almost hid the ocean swell sweeping west-
ward from Beveridge Reef, 300 miles away, to
crash against the grey coral cliffs that lined the
weather side of the island from Uhomotu to Liku.
In the village, sweltering under the groves of
cjco inut and breadfruit, not a sign of life was
visible. Your true Polynesian dreads heat as
much as cold.
* # #
“What an infernal day, and what a
horrible-looking coast,” muttered the trader as he
looked at the line of cliffs rising a sheer hundred
feet from the boiling surf at their base. Now
and then a heavy roller would hurl itself against
the wall of rock and leap high in air, drenching
with spray the stunted, tangled scrub that
covered the jagged summits of the cliffs to their
very edge, and pouring down the face in a fierce
white avalanche of roaring foam.
The tide was falling, arid here and there, at the
foot of the wall of rock, the trader could see the
protruding mounds and knobs of the black reef of
coral which, at low tide, formed a border of relief
to the cold grey of the cliffs above it. For 20 feet
or so the reef stood out, and then, like the coast
behind it, presented a perpendicular weed-clad
face to the rolling Pacific.
» * *
The hot, depressing calm irritated the
trader. He was not a drinking man, or he might
have drunk till the land-breeze set in and cooled
the air.
“I’ll shut up the store and camp under the
teacher’s orange-trees ; it’s cool there—hallo, what
do you want ?”
A native boy was standing in the room, holding
out a piece of paper. It was written upon in the
usual sprawling manner of natives, and was a
request to hand the bearer the articles mentioned.
“In the name of the evil spirits, who be these
that write— Maheke, Kitia, and Minea?” he
asked crossly.
“ Mahcke, Kitia ma Minea.”
“O wood-head ! am I any wiser now ?”
The boy stared solemnly, and then by a sudden
inspiration showed him a roll of money tied up in
the end of his waist-cloth.
“Ha !” said the trader, “ now do I see. Stolen
money, eh ? And these women have sent thee to
spend it. Now will I call for the fakajili (judge)
and have thee beaten.”
“ Nay, nay,” whined the boy, “ I be honest.”
“ Then why come to this door, which is tabu.
Do I buy or sell in this room ? Have I not a fate
koloa (store) ? ”
“ True, but I was forbidden to go there lest I
be seen.”
“Ha, ’tis stolen money then, else why fear to
be seen ?”
“ Mahekfi forbade me.”
“ And who is Maheke ? ”
“ The friend of Kitia.”
“ And who is Kitia ?”
“The friend of Minea.”
“O dolt, O half-awakened hog. How do I
know these names! Who, in God’s name, is
Minea ? ”
“ She be friend to Kitia and MahekS—they bo
friends to one another.”
“So. I see. These three then have stolen the
money between them— the fakafili ”
The boy began to blubber —“Nay, it is not so.
It is honest money. And these three gave it me
with the tuhi (letter) for thee, and bade me tell no
one. And if I came safely to them I was to have
one piece of money for myself, which Mahekfi
hath now in her hand.”
* * *
The trader was puzzled. It was so unusual
for native women to send anyone to spend money
for them. The rule was to make their purchases
ostentatiously, and show everyone that they had
money. He read the note again.
“Three white handkerchiefs, three white poll
combs, a bottle of musk, three pili dlo (chemises)
blue gossamer, tobacco and matches.”
* # #
“ What the deuce can it be ! ” he thought,
as he went into the adjoining store. He got the
articles named, and tied them into a parcel. Then
he looked again at the rude scrawling signatures :
“Tor us, Maheke, Minea, ma Kitia.’’
“ Here, boy, take these. What is thy name ? ”
“ Vetsi.”
“ So. And who are these women that send thee
to buy ? Hast thou three wives ? Who is
MahekS ? ”
The boy laughed at the pleasantry, and com-
menced : “ Maheke is the friend
The trader darted out his hand, caught him by
the shoulder, and shook him. “Now, tell me
where does Mahekd live?”
“In XJhomotu, with her mother. She it is
whose lover died in the Pokula (guano islands)
last year.”
“Good. And Minea?”
The parrot-like repetition of “ She is ” was
again commencing, when another shake brought
the boy to his senses.
“Minea is the thin girl with the foot that
wasteth away.”
“ Ha ! ” said the trader, and he asked no further
questions, while the boy, glad to be released, went
cautiously away with the parcel.
* * #
Although not yet six months on the
islands, and unfamiliar with the names of many
people in his own locality, the trader now remem-
bered these three girls. Sometimes they would
bring fruit or a little cotton for sale, and, unlike
the generality of the people, who would hang
about and bandy words with him, they would
take payment in cash and quietly go away.
Oueofthem, Minea, walked with a stick. She
was the youngest of the three, and her two com-
panions seemed tenderly anxious for her. Some
terrible bone-disease had crippled her foot, which
was slowly wasting away. Maheke), a sombre-
faced, black-browed creature, had one day been
pointed out to the trader as the girl who refused
to marry a man of her parents’ choice, for which
contumacy she received many thrashings. Of
Kitia he knew nothing, except that she was the
pretty and inseparable companion of the other
two.
# • •
“ Ani, said he to the teacher’s daughter,
a fat, sullen-faced girl, “ who be the three girls,
Kitia, Minea and Maheke?”
The sullen features lightened up vindictively.
Ah ! they were a bad, lazy lot. Maheke! the
shameless creature that would not marry a good
man like Paturei, who was a deacon. And why ?
Because she had a dead lover in Pokula. She
wanted more beatings. Kitia, an idle little beast,
that the white men favored because she dressed
her head with flowers and sang lewd Samoan
songs, and walked with bare bosom to the bathing-
place, which th a fakafili had forbidden, because it
was not modest. Minea, she who was once so
saucy and was now smitten by God for her sins—
“Oh, shut up, you putty-faced devil! ” said the
trader disgustedly, in English.
1 hou art but as a stranger here,” the girl com-
menced again oilily, “and these are girls whose
names have been called aloud at the fono for their
bad ways. They are three friends—a fourth there
is ; that is the Devil.”
“ Ah !” said the white man, mockingly, “then
have they a strong friend. Perhaps ’tis he that
giveth them so much money to spend in my idle
koloa. ’’
“ What money ?” said she, quickly.
The trader, for amusement, magnified the pur-
chases of the Three Friends. The teacher’s
daughter he knew tobea greedy, maliciouscreature,
and it pleased him to torment her.
Suddenly, with a cry of alarm, the fat Ani tore
past the astonished trader into the village, calling
out something about the Three Friends and the
cliffs of Uhomotu.
Before the white man could get to the village
every soul had left it, their brown bodies dashing
aside the shrubs and cotton bushes that lay in
their way as they hastened, bawling and yelling,
to the cliffs. Wondering if they had all gone mad,
he followed.
• # •
At a point called Matasuafa, where the
perpendicular face of the cliffs was steepest, the
natives—men, women and children—clustered
like bees. Those in front, holding with one hand
the branches of the tough scrub that grew on the
summit, gazed down at the black ledge of reef
that stood abruptly out from the foot of the cliff.
There, directly beneath, lay three figures in female
dress. Descent at this spot was impossible, and
the eyes of the watchers on top moved alternately
from the huddled-up forms beneath to the figures
of four or five men who were running along the
narrow table of reef a few hundred yards away.
The tide was dead low ; yet as the half-naked
men sprangacross the pools and air-holes that broke
up the crust of the reef, the ocean swell broke
savagely against its face and smothered them in
misty spray. And now and again a roller heavier
than the rest would send a flying sheet of water
hissing along the ledge of rock to sway to and fro
the limp hands and garments of the Three Friends.
It came up clear as crystal; it poured back again
through the gutters and air-holes to the sea tinged
with a bloody stain.
* * *
The men dashed on and picked them up,
and then fought their way back along the ledge of
cruel, black rock to a place where a narrow path
had been cut away in a break of the cliffs.
For some time the trader tried to get near them
to see if by any chance they yet lived. Whilst
waiting on the cliffs he had learnt the meaning of
the mysterious purchase of the morning. After
the boy Vetsi in a lonely sugar-cane
patch, the girls had dressed themselves in their
best, carefully oiling and combing their long,
glossy hair. Then, after making and smoking
some cigarettes and sprinkling one another with
scant, they bade the boy come with them. They
travelled an old, unused path of former days,
unknown to the boy, who now began to get
frightened, and cried.
• • •
The girls stopped, and Mahekd, taking
the boy’s hand, placed in it the half-dollar she
had promised him. She bade him go back, but
the lame girl, Minea, who seemed moved some-
what, took the boy to her bosom and kissed and
fondled him. Then she pushed him away, and
with the other two supporting her weakly frame,
they struck into the undergrowth that quivered to
the shock of the breakers dashing against the
face of Matasuafa.
• * *
The trader pushed silently through the
people and looked. Two, MahekS and Minea,
were dead. Their agony had been brief. The
third, the round-faced, laughing-voiced Kitia,
who was but budding into womanhood, still lived,
but that it was not for long could easily be seen.
Both legs and her back were broken.
A woman, with shaking hands and streaming
face, bent over her and spoke.
The girl’s eyes opened, big, soft, black and
tender.
“ EM, where art thou, MahekS . . . and
thou, my Minea. . . Shall I fail thee, Omy
friends . . . my friends.”
The woman laid her lips to the dying mouth
“My child, my Kitia, ’tis I, thy old mother ! ”
The bruised and bleeding fingers twitched
feebly, and then Ani, the Bitter-Tongued, knelt
and, raising the girl’s arms, placed the hands
against her mother’s cheek, and kept them there.
The woman sobbed a question, and, in a faint
whisper, the answer came.
“We had sworn it . . . long, long ago. ’Twas
when MahekS’s lover died we planned it. ‘ I will
die ere I am wife to Paturei,’she said. . . . We
were friends . . . friends. And Minea said
ihen 1 die with thee; for I suffer pain always—
always. And then I, I who was strong and well,
I jumped, too, for we were friends, and I had
sworn to them . . . to be with them . . .
always . . . forever. My mother . . . so old
art thou. . , .
* * #
The trader, with a sudden mist dimming
his eyes, and holding his hat in his hand, stood
back, and turned his face to the sea. Then he
walked slowly home to the village.
As he emerged from the narrow path into the
open the chill of the dewy night-breeze struck
upon his face.
He stopped a moment on the hill, listening,
bwas but the muffled boom of the rollers on
Matasuafa, sounding in loud, long symphony the
requiem of the Three Friends of Uhomotu.
