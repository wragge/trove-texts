THE AUSTRALIAN TRADITION
The essay I really like best in Arthur
Phillips’s The Australian Tradition
(Cheshire) is the one on Doha Ribush,
that Russian-born Melbourne producer
who, in the intervals of making
chocolates, practised in this country
the arduous and beautiful discipline of
Stanislavsky, rehearsing his actors for
six months or more until they were
either perfect or shot themselves, and
whom we all hoped was going to do
for the stage-play what his friend
Borovansky had done for the ballet . . .
turn the little theatres in one mighty
swoop into the Big theatre.
There were times, too, when it
seemed likely enough that he would
do it: in fact at times he did do it, and
Melbourne audiences had the privilege
of seeing, in their big city theatres,
not only Chekhov’s “The Cherry
Orchard” (“Ah, Chekhov’s pauses!”)
but even so unlikely an item as Gogol’s
“Lower Depths.” But Ribush swooped,
alas, too seldom ; he was like one of’
those South American lilies that flower
only once, by moonlight, every seven
years. It might have been that such
was his temperament; it was certainly
also due to the enormous obstacles the
commercial theatre put in his way in
those days. At any rate, he died, years
and years before he should have, and
that was that.
He had the most profound reverence
for the arts of any man, 1 think, I have
ever known ; and with that, a most
robust and even Rabelaisian love for
life as we 11... a wonderful and faintly
perilous companion, rejoicing in the
fishermen along the Victorian coast
(“Vot a type!”) or, in the dawn when
the blackbirds were singing, driving
home from an after-theatre party with
the utmost caution, inching along by
the kerb, only on the right-hand side
of the road . . .
I like Arthur Phillips’s essay not only
because he evokes these memories and
most ably sets down Ribush’s signifi-
cance in the theatre but also because
he displays in it powers of wit and
characterisation which, the opportunity
not arising, are not employed to the
same extent elsewhere in the book ;
and further because, being personal, it
necessarily gives some indication of his
own central position in Melbourne
cultural fife:
But these are Melbourne matters
and personal matters; and for a
general Australian audience his book
must rest upon his wider interests,
particularly his two memorable essays
on Lawson and Joseph Furphy.
In both of these his “line” is the
same: that we have underrated these
two fine writers as craftsmen. If Sterne
writes an odd book, as in “Tristram
Shandy” he did write a very odd book,
we give him full credit for knowing
what he was doing ; but if Furphy
writes an odd book we think he
blundered into it. If Chekhov writes
with a beautiful simplicity and an
exquisite symmetry of form, we say
he was a great artist; if Lawson does
it, we say he is “artless.” And in both
cases we do this injustice, as Phillips
stresses in another challenging essay,
simply because they are Australian:
because of our “cultural cringe” in the
face of some quite imaginary Euro-
pean superiority. It is a state of mind
Which I am sure is passing ; but it
always tends to reassert itself and is
always worth reproving.
Phillips may sometimes give the
appearance of exaggerating the extent
to which Lawson consciously thought
about his work, but I don’t think he
really does exaggerate—it is just that
when you talk about craftsmanship you
can never quite draw the line between
conscious and unconscious artistry—
and certainly nobody after reading this
essay could ever again look upon
Lawson as merely the unthinking bush-
man. The Furphy essay, equally
impressive in its case for planned and
deliberate artistry (even if, as Phillips
is the first to admit, it didn’t wholly
come off), is particularly interesting for
the device Phillips uses to prove his
point: “reading back” into “Such is
Life” the “juicy quarter of the
mammoth” which Furphy cut out in
“Rigby’s Romance.” whereby the
present sentimental and melodramatic
central story is balanced and offset by
a far more characteristic irony.
The great value of these two essays,
apart from the points they make, seems
to me that they are thoroughly Aus-
tralian: in their style, to begin with,
vigorous, direct and enriched with
pithy colloquialisms ; and then in their
firm assumption not only that there
are Australian writers worth talking
about but that there is an audience for
the talk. In criticism as well as in
literature we begin to have an “Aus-
tralian tradition”: the thing A. G.
Stephens started, here ably and know-
ledgably continuing,
I must note, though, with some grief,
that in one essay, the study of McCrae
and Brennan. Phillips falls into the
snare we all set for ourselves when we
begin to look at our literature from a
nationalistic point of view: that of
undervaluing our writers because, one
way or another, they got the gum-trees
wrong. Most of what Phillips says
about McCrae is true enough: that he
got not only his Australian imagery
wrong but even, in “I Love to Lie
under the Lemon,” hopelessly
muddled the Mediterranean ; and so
did not write even logically acceptable
fantasy. But suppose, instead of
demanding “a unity of reference”
behind even a fantasy, you look on this
poem not as sense of any kind, but as
a sort of violin-music? Or suppose
you say that McCrae, strangely and
lyrically anticipating T. S. Eliot’s
method, is taking his images from
literature and with no regard for
faptuality, juxtaposing them for the
scenes and emotions they evoke?
Or suppose, instead of relying on

PERIWINKLES
/ am not against living again, like these
Which I watch; perambulating rock
pools,
Climbing near death in sea-anemones ;
With their thatch-roofed cottages, or
shells
— Periwinkles. All the base sludge 1 leave,
The snail-slime of my workaday, I trace
To a seashore cottage, and a grave
By the rocks protected; in a lonely place
Where sly gossip enters only like a
creeping tide,
And l shut my door to more boisterous
storm:
As I imagine periwinkles to have
fireside
Comfort in their shells and be warm,
Though the sea is cold, and the immense
World, outside, an unfriendly fence.

There are few industries not served by DAVID BROWN products
DAVID
BROWN
and the
Jodrell Bank
Telescope
The Foundries Division of David Brown cast the bearing housings in which the 230’ diameter
paraboloid reflector is set and General Gear Division, Park Works, manufactured the final driving
gears which enable the 2,000-ton structure to be revolved with minute precision and control
around the circular track of 360’ diameter.
The new radio telescope at the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, Cheshire, is the largest and
only automatically steerable radio telescope in existence, reaching out into space a distance of
1000 million light years. Notable performances to date have been the tracking of the satellites
in their orbits around the earth. The telescope in itself is a marvellous feat of construction and
one in which David Brown played an important role, for whenever the telescope revolves or
changes its position, it moves in or by means of components made within the David Brown
organisation.
In the farming field David Brown also shows the way with a fine record of achievement and
enterprise. David Brown tractors are continually setting new standards of performance, power
and economy, and thus meet the needs of more farmers than any other tractor
on the market. The range includes 18 wheeled and crawler models from 12 to
50 h.p. and over 60 matched implements. You name the job David Brown
will do it.

OUTMODED "JUSTICE"
NO part of the Government in many
States of the Commonwealth is more in
need of revision than the administra-
tion of justice at lower-court level.
Sometimes it has fallen so low
that it is a moot point, as in traffic
courts, whether it has not become a
mere fine-collecting agency.
There is unrest about the existing
state of affairs among responsible
lawyers who practise in the lower
courts and among those which deal
with appeals from magisterial findings.
There would be more unrest if jus-
tices of the peace these days did any-
thing judicial at all.
There are tens of thousands of J.P.s,
and it is odds-on that if a dozen of
them were selected at random and
they were asked to recite their powers
and duties they would all fail.
Appointment to the justice-list has
become a convenience for offices which
have large numbers of documents to
sign before a justice on oath or attesta-
tion, the said justice in most cases
having not the faintest idea of the pro-
cedures which he should observe or
what his or the oath-taker’s obligations
are —even if he is aware that it is neces-
sary in some cases to make an oath
in due form.
J.P.s are usually created through
the recommendation of a member of
Parliament, who is nearly always
as ignorant as the appointee of what
the office is supposed to involve, but
who wishes to convenience a friendly
constituent or dignify a typist for the
attestation of documents.
The duties of most of them end with
their going to a court and being sworn-
in by a judge; which is somewhat
lucky, perhaps, for the country., since,
if the cloud of jay-pays began reading
the Act and using their powers, even
such as they are, the most remarkable
results might ensue.
The justice-of-the-peace system was
initiated in Australia under the ori-
ginal charters and commissions of the
Colony, and the lower magisterial
courts began to dperate soon after the
arrival of the First Fleet. For a very
long period the system worked much
on the English system, with the
magistrates acting as local administra-
tors, court magistrates, controllers of
constables, fixers of wages and of the
assize of bread. They were honorary,
save for the grant of extra servants and
rations and, later, of some allowances.
The Governor, in times of crisis,
before the existence of any form of
Legislative Council, was apt to call
them together. They were men of power
and influence, and the office was much
coveted.
The Bench was theoretically honor-
ary, though even in the days of the
military autocracy it was the habit of
the chief judge—the judge-advocate—
to preside over sittings of the magis-
trates in the capital, and of the senior
officer to do so in other stations.
This system gradually became mori-
bund in the days of swift expansion
of population, but it is only in modern
times that the honorary benches have
been destroyed by the bureaucrats and
the unthinking, half-baked politicians
With minds always made-up for them
by their administrative heads.
Their problem called for a change,
largely in view of the indiscriminate
appointments to the honorary Bench
that had taken place from the best
material available —which would often
have better adorned the dock than the
Bench. The solution was a bad one.
In place of the honorary Benches
presided over by a legally experienced
or qualified magistrate with only a
casting-vote but with the right of legal
instruction to his lay brethren, the sys-
tem of a single stipendiary magistrate
sitting alone was adopted in all big
towns in most States.
Practically all police - court and
primary-court business is done by this
system, which would not be a bad one
if it were not that it usually has been
divorced from the judicial system and
integrated with the administrative
public service.
It is true that there is an appeal to
the judicial courts from these lower
courts, but in N.S.W. and other States
the magistrates rise through the public
service from clerkship, are associated
in non-judicial office with police, and
finally end. with or without some sort
of examination, on the Bench with
familiar associates all round them.
Cases are often heard by a magis-
trate with no qualification not obtained
in the public service, with a police-
constable as prosecutor whose know-
ledge of the law (and even of the Eng-
lish language) is sometimes sketchy,
and with a defendant (unrepresented)
who has little knowledge of his rights.
When he finds himself in difficulty
the magistrate is apt to turn, naturally,
not to some judicial source, as a minor
judge would do, but to an under-
secretary to his department.
In the United Kingdom the old
system rules and has maintained the
intimate link between the citizen and
the law which has always been one of
the saving graces of the English courts.
The justice-of-the-peace system has not
fallen into disgrace, partly because it
is judicially controlled and linked and
partly because it is given responsible
work, and the Lord Chancellor, who is
the head of the system, sees to it that
the men who do it are responsible and
have qualifications.
Where there are stipendiary magis-
trates they are invariably qualified
members of the Bar. But they are few
and far between —London gets along
with three, plus twenty sitting in the
juvenile courts. Other big English
cities run to 15 all told.
The majority of the courts are pre-
sided over by unpaid justices who are
chosen —on the advice of the Lord
Lieutenant of the County (the senior
justice) and a local advisory com-
mittee— by the Lord Chancellor,
who keeps a very close eye on their
proceedings.
And not only the citizen but the legal
profession is closely integrated with the
system, which makes every member of
the magistracy in England proud to
carry the letters J.P. after his name.
Every Queen’s Counsel in England and
Wales is automatically on the justices’
roll and is expected to sit on occasion.
Even Judges in Appeal are not too
proud to sit on honorary Benches. The
Recorders are citizen Queen’s Counsel
in practice who, save when they act as
commissioners of the central court,
are the chief magistrates of cities and
boroughs, addressed as “Your Wor-
ship,” and proud to be, as few Q.C.s
would be in Australia, even if paid for
the job.
The matter goes higher than the
normal police-magistrate work, for the
Quarter Sessions are held in the coun-
ties by the magistrates in assembly
presided over by a legally qualified
chairman, and in the boroughs (which
hold separate sessions) by the Q.C.
Recorder. In both cases the jury sys-
tem operates and they have powers to
deal with crime that falls short of
death-penalty or life-sentence.
The Australian lower-court system
needs reorganisation, both in the com-
position and affiliation of its Benches.
These should certainly be placed uni-
formly under the jurisdiction of the
superior judges or the Chief Justice
and undergo a change to the old sys-
tem, which brings the citizen closer to
the law, implemented under a revised
system of J.P. appointments.


THE HOUSE THAT C.-O.-L. BUILT


PLAIN ENGLISH
France in Travail
After a month without a Government,
France has received its twenty-second
since the new Constitution was
inaugurated 12 years ago and with it a
chaos which it has not known in times of
peace since the period immediately after
the Franco-Prussian war.
At the beginning of May, France was
struggling to find somebody who would
form a Government, but there was none
of the rush for office that would happen
if there were a lot of Cabinet seats going
in Australia.
On the night of May 8, M. Pleven
(U.D.S.R.) for instance, tried to get a
team together, but at breakfast next day
it fell to pieces. The President, M. Coty,
in turn sent for M. Billeres and then for
the youthful Maurice Faure. They are
both orthodox Radicals with a party of 33
in a House of 589 (including overseas
Deputies). Then the President turned to
the Senate, but the 63-year-old Senator
Berthoin, the first Senator offered the job
of Prime Minister since the war —there
have been 16 P.M.s in the past 22
Governments —had shown no alacrity
for the job.
Late at night on May 9, Pflimlin, the
White Hope of the M.R.P., proceeding
cautiously, “undertook to see whether he
could accept the President’s invitation,”
and settled down to busy discussions with
Mollet, of the Socialists, and Pinay, of
the Right Wing. It was now obvious that
Pflimlin was the only man with a chance
of succeeding. At any rate, his experience
was obvious since he had been 15 times
a Minister in twelve years, eight times as
Minister of Agriculture, and had twice
before failed to form Governments.
As he skated warily, France and Algiers
erupted. The French Army in Algeria
under General Salan seized the Govern-
ment and remitted it to a Committee of
Public Safety in the traditional French
fashion. Thousands demonstrated in
Paris in favour of holding Algeria, fears
having been aroused by the proposed
composition of the new Ministry that it
intended to hand-over North Africa,
under American influence, which is sus-
pected of guiding African policy with
oil as the underlying motive.
Premier Pflimlin’s assurances that he
would never allow the bonds between
France and Algiers to be broken was
rather lost in the Right-wing cry for
General de Gaulle as a dictator; that
astute and curious leader having retired
like Cincinnatus to his home in eastern
France in 1955.
He appeared briefly to announce that
he would hold himself ready to “assume
the powers of the Republic,” and then
retired once more to prepare for a second
emergence at a press-conference due on
the evening of May 19, which would
probably decide whether France is or is
not due for civil war.
It is being governed under a state of
emergency by a Government which is
merely a caretaker thing, slipping towards
chaos and Communist triumph. Its
military leadership is nearly all on the
side of the rebels under General Salan
in Africa. The dominant Right-wing is
resurgent and the Communists active.
Civil war in France would be disaster
for Western Europe. But France has never
cared much for the fate of Western
Europe. It is the most individualistic of
countries, and its chaos has always led to
European upheaval.
Business as Usual
When he opened his Liberal and
Country-party campaign the Victorian
Premier made no mention of balancing
a Budget if he is elected again in Vic-
toria ; silence on such a subject was
politically discreet for a Government
which has piled-up deficits totalling £ll
million in its term of office.
There was no reference to the
wisdom of budgeting within economic
limits in the A.L.P. policy-speech,
either. Only the Country party and
the D.L.P. have affected to be aghast
in the drift in the State’s finances, and it
would not be cynical to presume that
this is so because neither has the
remotest chance of winning a majority
in the Lower House.
Moreover, there is no crusading in
Bolte’s outlook for his next term, if he
gets it. Nonetheless, it has an integrity
that must be admired and an authority
that stems from being on top of the
job. The new spending he proposes will
be on organisations which are especially
knowledgeable in their own spheres
rather than on handouts to individuals,
and there is a sound emphasis on health
and youth services, and on agriculture.
Bolte’s case, as he tacitly admits, rests
on his Government’s performances
more than on its promises for the
future. This indicates a complacency
which may prove politically dangerous,
according to the more progressive Vic-
torian Liberals ; but there is no doubt
that Bolte’s record is impressive.
His Government abolished the
slummy emergency-housing settlements
at Camp Pell and elsewhere, sold 4000
houses from the Housing Commission,
proclaimed 20 acres for slum-reclama-
tion, established the Home Finance
Trust to assist earnest savers who
wanted their own homes, and made
available a record £l6 million for
houses through the trust and the Hous-
ing Commission.
The least advertised of the. Govern-
ment’s achievements is the modernisa-
tion of the railway ; yet £lO million a
year has been spent on improvements
to suburban and country rail facilities,
38 new diesels bought (with 25 more
on order), 15 air-conditioned country
passenger-cars and 22 new suburban
trains commissioned, work begun on
the Albury-Melbourne uniform-gauge
railway, and the suburban network
fashioned to link eventually with the
underground.
Since the railways have provided
most of the State’s financial imbalance,
and housing is a subject on which all
the Opposition parties have made lavish
promises, the extent of the Bolte
Government’s efforts in these fields is
convincing.
Bolte did not mention the best feature
(probably) of his regime. This was that
the sound, often vigorous and liberal,
government of the past three years had
undoubtedly attracted important indus-
tries to the State. He did, however,
point-out that the alternative to the
L.C.P. was a minority Government with
the usual plots, intrigues and bargains.
5.A. and the Snowy Scheme
S.A. Premier Playford’s persistent charge
that his State’s rights under the Murray
Waters Agreement are prejudiced by the
Snowy ■ Mountains Agreement between
the Federal, N.S.W. and Victorian
Governments seems to have achieved
something.
In the second-reading debate on the
Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Power
Bill, Prime Minister Menzies gave an
assurance that there was no intention
of depriving S.A. of any of its rights.
He said he realised that although N.S.W.
and Victoria had a primary interest in
the waters of the rivers concerned in
the agreement and that the waters were
of great value to those two States, “the
waters of the Murray, when entering
South Australia, are not just of great
value, but are vital to the State.”
The point at issue is that the Tooma,
a tributary of the Murray, is to be
diverted into the Adaminaby Dam and
thence via the Tumut into the Murrum-
bidgee. Later, portion of the Snowy
River is to be diverted into the Murray.
Playford has questioned both diversions
as infringing South Australian rights
under the Murray Waters Agreement.
Menzies claims that South Australia’s
rights are fully protected in that they
cannot be affected by the Snowy Moun-
tains Agreement, as S.A. is not a party
to that agreement; secondly, an amend-
ment to the new Act, inserted in the
Senate, provides that nothing in the Act
can be taken as affecting the rights of
S.A. under the Murray Waters Agree-
ment. Finally, the Prime Minister read
a document signed by the Victorian
Premier, the N.S.W. Deputy Premier and

himself agreeing that the Tooma diver-
sion and any other diversion above
Albury shall be regarded as “a diversion
by the State.”
This, he said, would have to be incor-
porated in the Murray Waters Agree-
ment by amendment and it would have
the effect of safeguarding S.A.’s rights.
In the committee stages of the bill,
the Opposition, in the unusual role of
the defenders of State rights, tried to
delay proclamation until S.A.’s rights
were fully safeguarded, but S.A. mem-
bers on the Government side of the House
expressed themselves satisfied with the
intention of the parties to the new
agreement.
Sputnik Burning-out
The week’s happenings abroad illustrate
the debacle in Western policy since the
Americans took-over after Suez, displac-
ing the British in the Middle East and
Asia and Africa generally.
The changes since then are really
startling.
After calling the tune and exhibiting
the might of the Sixth Fleet against
Anglo-French action in the Eastern
Mediterranean, Mr. Dulles has now dis-
covered that the dominating factor in
that area is Khrushchev, via Nasser, who
is the latter’s stooge, controlling Arab
policies in Syria, Yemen and other
strategic areas. In Lebanon this week
anti-Government riots had a special
reference to American influence, and the
U.S. Embassy suffered indignity.
The South American countries of the
Organisation of American States, in
which the republics of Ecuador,
Colombia and Guatemala are officially
equal to the United States, according to
a principle that the tail-hairs are equal
to the dog, have been showing anything
but goodwill to Washington during Vice-
President Nixon’s “goodwill” tour.
At Lima the “goodwill” envoy was a
target for stones, oranges, bottles and the
fine and fruity vituperation to which
Peninsular languages lend themselves in
the hands of experts.
At Bogota the local students organised
a barrage of coffee-beans. At Caracas,
in Venezuela, the fabulous capital of a
fabulous oil State, his life was reported
to have been in actual danger from the
mob.
These events in usually docile satellites
have allegedly given President Eisen-
hower grave doubts as to whether it
would be wise for the Vice-President to
repeat the experiment of a goodwill tour
in Europe. There, certainly, the atmos-
phere is better —in spots.
The Continental situation is not entirely
suitable for goodwill tours, with a
new Napoleon risen in Algeria, American
aid cut and Germany unreceptive about
atomic defence.
The rebellion of the French Algerian
Army, with its call for a dictatorship by
General de Gaulle —which would prob-
ably represent a major disturbing factor
in European politics, if not the actual
seeds of war, since the U.S.S.R. and Ger-
many would both do their best to pre-
vent it —is linked both with fear of Com-
munist gains during the period of no-
Government in France over the past
month, and with distrust of the Ameri-
cans in Algeria.
Even Canada has become a source of
worry to Washington. Having been
reminded last year by the Canadian
External Affairs Minister that Canada
was not a small South American State to
be bullied and browbeaten, relationships
have been on the drift ever since to a
point to alarm the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
The committee has decided to hold
art investigation into U.S.-Canadian
relationships, an unprecedented step,
since it normally concerns itself only with
general foreign policy and has never
before pinpointed its efforts to deal with
an individual country.
It is beginning to look as if Mr. Dulles
is a political sputnik near burning-out
point in his orbit. It is a serious position
for the West. For, in assuming leader-
ship in the way it has done, Washington
has so weakened the moral influence of
the U.K. and British Commonwealth in
general that there' is no substitute. And
the Communist bloc is gaining ground in
international relationships.
The Lost Sou!
[By “R.R.D.”]
Perhaps the answer lies in the haunted
wood at Rossignol, or on the green
slopes of Ethe, or in the charnel-house
of Verdun. That is a facile explanation
of the reason for the decline of France’s
great military power. But no one can
accept this who saw the careless
bravery, almost superhuman, of the
paratroop-volunteers who night after
night took their places to jump, at odds
of ten-to-one against landing within the
perimeter, at Dien Bien Phu. Nor he
who knows their stand within that
doomed fortress, or the exploits of their
battalion in Korea.
It must be agreed that there always
has existed a very sharp distinction
between the French Colonial Army and
(with the exception of the cavalry,
chasseurs alpins parachutists and Foreign
Legion) the metropolitan. But the fight-
ing in Indo-China, and especially in
Algeria, has brought in metropolitan
troops and so has to a certain extent
removed that difference.
It may safely be said that the cause of
France’s troubles does not lie with the
French fighting officer or fighting man.
It may further be said that the fault is
not with his higher military leaders,
although instances might be quoted of
apparent strategic or tactical misapprecia-
tion. The true explanation of these is
more likely to prove to the historian the
wrongness of political necessity dictating
the conduct of operations in the field.
The trouble lies nearer the heart. In
Indo-China the cry was always that the
war was lost in Paris. They meant that
the politicians —and in consequence the
people who chose them —were not really
interested in what was happening in
Indo-China, where the main part of the
fighting was done by professional soldiers
of the French Army, either as volunteers
(like the paratroops) or in the colonial
regiments or the Legion. So France lost
for herself (and the Western world) an
area of great strategic importance and
also many of her best officers and
n.c.o.s, whom she could ill spare (as any-
one who knew them personally would
agree). Perhaps some widowed comtesse
living in a remote manor-house mourned
the loss of a son like his father mort
sur le champ d’honneur on the Plain of
Jars, or a Breton fisher-girl wept for her
young lover who jumped to his death
among the Viet Minh bayonets.
But these people were of no concern
■—they did not really count in choosing
the umpteenth “Government” of the
Fourth Republic, split among its little
splinter-groups, all riddled with their own
selfish interests.
The trouble lies in the soul of France.
Among the French officers one some-
times heard discussions of what the
answer was. Some spoke nostalgically
of royalism and envied us our Queen ;
some of the glories of Napoleon ; some
of “le maquis” and all its implications;
some of Leclerc or De Lattre ; some—
only a few eight years ago—of de Gaulle.
But all spoke of “the Army” and La
France.
Timber and Freights
[From Canberra]
The Federal Government will examine
inter-State shipping freight-rates as a
means of assisting the timber industry
in Western Australia and Tasmania
following on a special Tariff Board report.
The board has found that a general
increase in the present levels of tariff
protection would not overcome prevailing
slackness in the industry.
But it has recommended that weather-
boards should not be admitted at con-
cessional rates of duty after September 30,
and that two other items which provide
for the admission at concessional-duty
rates plywood door-panels and
undressed timbers for the manufacture of
doors—should be deleted from the tariff.
One of the major problems of the
timber industry in Tasmania and W.A.
is not a matter directly related to the
industry so much as to the inter-State
shipping industry. A reduction in freight
or a freight-subsidy would undoubtedly
improve the competitive position of timber
from both States.
At present it isn’t possible to determine
to what degree timber imports from
Malaya and Borneo have captured the
markets in South Australia at the expense
of the two principal timber States. How-
ever, higher freights, particularly from
W.A., have undoubtedly encouraged some
substitution of Malayan timbers for
domestic hardwoods. Producers in Tas-
mania and W.A. have to face competition
in S.A. and N.S.W. from overseas
exporters of Oregon and other building
timbers.
The freight-rates for these imported
timbers vary in a way which upset the
competitive position of the domestic
producers. While overseas freight-rates
are tending to fall, coastal rates are rising.

“W.P.T.”: An old chap keen on the

Unlike our Western way,

As lower than the ducks,
Quite, quite inferia !
They entertain one hope:
Not for some perfumed soap,
To own a flunkey,
But handicap to shake
By getting an even break
With chimp, and monkey.
Their men respect the monk.
For never talking bunk
Or venting rages.
Silent the simian, too,
On just how much they drew
That week as wages,
Or when they take a drink.
Just what the monkeys think
Of bucks assessing
The relative worth of gals
And orang-utans as pals
We’ll just be guessing.
The women there don’t mind
When beaten or maligned,
Forbidden raiment;
It never gets their goat
’Cause they can’t get a vote
Or Equal Payment.
But what does get ’em mad
Is when some village lad
Glares at a lady;
Then, when a chimpanzee
Promenades past to see
Him hoist his cady !

Do Exams Test Education?
By M. F. DIXON
Frequently teachers
who coach Students for
leaving-certificate exami-
nations in N. S. Wales
complain that some of them are
inexcusably failed ; or that the
examination-paper in English
was not designed as a true test
of their educational qualifica-
tions.
Lately, however, a corre-
spondent signing himself
“Teacher,” wrote to the
“Sydney Morning Herald” say-
ing that seven of the 70 students
he coached for the 1957 exami-
nation received B passes “who
should not, under any circum-
stances, have been passed” ; and
that “five of his 12 students
who were awarded A passes
should not have been given
them.” He said that when he
discussed the L.C. paper with
two of the successful students
after the examination they
gave answers which were “so
erroneous as to make it very
problematical whether they
deserved a pass.”
The honors and literature
papers set in the examinations
were certainly designed to test
the “higher” qualifications of
students, although it may be
doubted whether they had any
real down-to-earth educational
value ; but the “Pass Paper B
—Expression” was, in my
opinion, a genuine attempt to
test the educational standards
of young people of today. It
opened with a warning that
students would be judged on the
“clarity with which they
expressed their ideas; the
thoughtfulness with which
they arranged them in para-
graphs ; and the care shown in
punctuation, spelling and
grammar.”
Students were then asked to
“express a balanced opinion
about radio-advertising”; to
comment on an opinion that the
“worst social crime anybody
can commit is the awful sin of
causing a person or an
animal —to lose dignity,” and
to “set-out their thoughts
suggested by the remark of the
Duke of Edinburgh that ‘war,
argument and controversy are
news. Peaceful co-operation is
a bore.’ ”
Unfortunately I have not had
an opportunity of seeing how
students generally handled these
questions ; but within the last
six months I have seen a good
deal of the work of a number
of young people who secured
A passes in English at the
leaving-certificate examinations
in the last three or four years,
and an astonishingly high pro-
portion of them now lack either
the ability to express themselves
with the “clarity” insisted on in
the 1957 paper or the energy
to apply themselves seriously
to the task.
What these young people
lack in “clarity and thought-
fulness,” however, they make-
up in confidence—confidence
in their ability to distinguish
between the good and the bad,
the simple and the confused, in
the writings of people who
have long been accepted as at
least competent and perhaps
even authoritative in their usage
of the English language. Maybe
they would have been less out-
spoken in their comments had
they known the identity of the
authors they were asked to
pass judgment on, but that
would hardly have been a true
test of their literary integrity.
Winston Churchill has always
been regarded by most people
as a writer, of excellent prose ;
but a passage from his broad-
cast on the death of the King
a few years ago was variously
described by these young people
as being “overly sentimental” ;
“poorly written,” “trite,”
“corny,” “lacking in dignity,”
“ornate,” “pretentious,” and
“having a disappointing touch
of banality.” Here is the
Churchill extract:
During the last months the King
walked with death as if death were
a companion—an acquaintance
whom he recognised and did not
fear. In the end death came as
a friend; and after a happy day
of sunshine and sport; after a
“good-night” to those who loved
him best, he fell asleep, as every
man and woman who strives to
fear God and nothing else, may
hope to do.
It is worthy of note that one
of Churchill’s severest critics
used the obsolete word
“overly” ; and three others in
repeating the extract spelt
acquaintance without the first
“c.” Only one of the eight
young people who commented
on the extract had a good word
to say about it. He described it
as a “poetic and well-worded
reference.”
An extract from a broadcast
made by the Australian Prime
Minister (Mr. Menzies) on the
outbreak of World War II was
treated with almost the same
scant respect as Mr. Churchill’s
utterance: Here is portion of
what Mr. Menzies said:
What I want to do tonight is
just to put before you honestly
and as clearly as I can a short
account of how this crisis has
developed. The history of recent
months in Europe has been an
eventful one. It will exhibit to
the eyes of the future student some
of the most remarkable instances
of ruthlessness and indifference to
common humanity which the darkest
centuries of European history can
scarcely parallel. Moreover it will,
I believe, demonstrate that the
leader of Germany has for a long
time steadily pursued a policy which
was deliberately designed to pro-
duce either war or a subjugation
of one non-German country after
another by the threat of war.
Again only one critic
(not the same one) found
merit in what was said, but
he spoilt it by a number of
misspellings, the worst being
“consise” and “parralel.”
Others described the P.M.’s
utterance as “too wordy and too
rhetorical”; one said it was
“too fruity and over-blown” ;
another that it was “riddled
with cliches.”
I should have expected an
extract from Dame Mary
Gilmore’s book Old Days Old
Ways, to win commendation
from Australian critics, as
indeed it has ; but the young
people who were asked to
comment on the following
passage could find little merit
in it:
One of the wonderful things that
memory shows is how far, how
very far we have travelled in thought
in this last half-century of ours.
Had the world gone as fast in its
earlier ages, where now would his-
tory have to place us of the later
centuries? To what might we not
have risen? Sixty years ago there
was a ghost behind every bush, a
haunt in every shadow and, let it
be added, a prayer before every
undertaking. Now the ghosts have
departed, the haunts have peace,
and prayer ... let it go at that.
One or two “critics” praised
the extract, but the majority
condemned it as “muddled,
because the writer did not make
clear what was meant.” One
said it was “melodramatic and
over-written” ; another queried
the use of “haunt” as a noun ;
and still another said that “as
for the lack of a prayer before
every undertaking, this can
easily be dispelled by visiting
the nearest cemetery where it
will be seen that prayers are
offered before every Under-
taking.”
But Dame Mary’s friends
need not fear that she alone
has fallen from literary grace,
because an extract from
Fowler’s “Modern English
Usage” condemning the use of
the phrase “if and when”
simply inspired the critics to
let themselves go. Fowler said
that any writer who uses “if and
when” lays himself open to
many suspicions—he is either
timid ; he likes verbiage for its
own sake ; he is lazy ; or he
thinks he will be safer with a
second sword in his left hand.
“What a mental tangle!”
commented one of his critics.
It is a mixture of over-writing
and redundancy.” Another said
the extract “hardly made
sense” ; a third described it as
“vague” ; and still another said
it was “too involved and had
too many subordinate clauses.”
It is astonishing that no one
had a good word to say for
Fowler, who must now con-
sider himself dethroned as an
authority on the English
language.
There was generally a good
word for an extract from an
American magazine in which
the writer said “farewell to a
battleship,” although one or
two regarded it as “a bit over-
done” ; but William Cobbett’s
story of how he learned
grammar was described
as “old - fashioned.” There
was equally severe con-
demnation of the writing of
Wickham Steed, a former editor
of “The Times” (London); and
an extract from Arnold
Bennett’s “Journals” was said
to be “slightly disjointed,”
“lacking in news sense” and
“not suitable for a newspaper.”
Perhaps the severest criticism
of all was directed at a man
who, above all others, should
know what he is writing about
—an examiner in English at the
London University. His ex-
planation of “Plain English”
was variously described as
“clumsily written,” “words
wrongly used,” and “meaning
badly expressed.” Again one
critic had a word of praise for
it —he said it was “splendidly
written, clear in purpose, and
obviously the work of a keen
student of the language.” But
this particular critic said some
scathing things about the other
examples of writing, so maybe
they were a mixed lot after all
and, on the whole, worthy of
criticism. I must confess that
reading all that was said about
them left me in such a
“mental tangle” that I wouldn’t
know!

That jobs-for-M.P.s advertisement in
Canberra (B. 14/5/’5B) has brought
another factor into the current discus-
sion of Parliamentary privilege. Morgan,
M.H.R. for Reid, who was a key figure
in the Browne-Fitzpa trick breach-of-
privilege case in 1955, recently asked for
revision of privileges and reminded the
Prime Minister of a promise that the
subject would be investigated.

Tasmanian Parliament can be relied
upon every few years or so to throw-up
a bribery-charge involving a Minister.
The latest example has a novel twist —it’s
a two-way charge, with a Minister alleg-
ing that an attempt has been made to
bribe him, and the alleged briber assert-
ing that the Minister has solicited a bribe
from him.
The allegations arise from an applica-
tion made by Sydney businessman George
Fitzpatrick for a licence to conduct the
Tasmanian Lottery. Dr. Turnbull, Tas-
manian Treasurer, alleges that in
November last Fitzpatrick offered him
from 3 per cent, to 5 per cent, of the
takings for a personal licence, or £20,000
for A.L.P. funds for a licence for a com-
pany of which Fitzpatrick would be a
member. Fitzpatrick’s version, as told to
Premier Cosgrove and the Tasmanian
Solicitor-General, is that Dr. Turnbull
offered him a licence for £20,000.
When the matter was raised in a no-
confidence debate last week Attorney-
General Fagan said that over a period
of weeks he had urged the Premier to
have a full inquiry regardless of political
consequences ; he had finally gone so far
as to submit his resignation. Eventually
a police investigation had been held,
which satisfied the Government that
although someone had offered a bribe
there was insufficient evidence to charge
anyone.
There is no way in which one can come
to a conclusion on who proposed the
bribe, since there is no corroboration, and
naturally, in accordance with our principles,
on these matters, we assume innocence.
There are puzzling factors in both
versions of what took place at the meet-
ing of the two men in Fitzpatrick’s hotel-
room. Turnbull’s report to the Solicitor-
General at one stage mentioned 3 per
cent, and at another 5 per cent, as the
inducement offered; Fitzpatrick’s state-
ment said that Turnbull asked for £20,000
to be paid in two certified cheques of
£lO,OOO each —a rather unusual request
for a bribe-seeker.
If the Tasmanian Solicitor-General and
Attorney-General are unable on the evi-
dence available to them to decide which,
if either, of the stories is dinkum, the
general public hasn’t much chance of
doing so. It can, however, mark-up the
unsavory episode as one more argument
against Governments having any truck
with the shoddy lottery game.

Several picture-theatres in suburban

Often when a horrible murder is
committed there are people who howl
for the murderer’s blood until he is
brought to justice ; then they start feeling
sorry for him and jib at hanging him.
Something of the same attitude is
adopted with inflation. While it was dis-
rupting the economy people were point-
ing accusing fingers at each other and
declaring inflation to be the worst evil
that followed World War 11. Now in
Australia inflation appears to be under
control for the moment, coinciding,
though, with a little unemployment.
Already there are people clamoring for
the release of inflation regardless of the
damage it would undoubtedly do in a
very short time. Memories are short.

Tinaroo is a name all Government
departments, State and Federal, should
paste in their hats. Tinaroo Falls dam
(North Queensland) looks like being
completed this year, ahead of schedule.
Although this is unusual, there’s nothing
unique in it, but—the completed cost
is now expected to be £6,850,000, which
is nearly £1 million below the 1951
estimate. And that is something!

Liberal-party and Country-party leaders
in N.S.W. will have to come to an
understanding on poker-machines if they
are to present a common policy at the
next election as intended. Davis Hughes,
new leader of the Country party, is dead
against the one-armed bandits and wants
to ban them completely. Liberal-leader
Morton has in the past spoken of ban-
ning the 2s. machines —the “killers” —
and of allowing the clubs a fairly long
period to adjust their finances to a
possible eventual ban on all machines.
Last week the party-leaders discussed
this matter. Apparently they’ll report
back to their parties and meet again.
Co-ordination of road-tax policy is also
under discussion.

Judges Kirby and Gallagher, who

Frank Scully, the young but not
untalented leader of 60 D.L.P. candidates
in the Victorian election —and the only
one with a seat —came-up with a glow-
ing programme at Richmond Town Hall.
He promised £5OO marriage-loans,
increased child-endowment, more and
cheaper houses, hire-purchase at gilt-
edged rates, a deep-sea port at Port
Albert, cuts in sales- and entertainment-
taxes and probate duties, an exclusive
accident-hospital, an insurance fund to
provide against acts of God, more
schools —and balanced Budgets. He
didn’t say how he’d manage the Federal
part of rhis programme.
Some of Scully’s less spectacular
promises in concessions in Government
services for pensioners and unemployed
are less costly and more appealing and
may win votes ; but none of his pro-
gramme was as good electioneering as the
gratuitous help he was given by the
bloke who cut his A.B.C. landline a few
seconds after he began to speak. That
should at least make him safe in Rich-

A Senate select committee is to inquire
into indemnity-payments made by ship-
owners to maritime unions. Senate
Opposition-leader McKenna can’t see
any necessity for the committee, as the
A.C.T.U. has already conducted an
inquiry, has decided that the practice is
against industrial principles and that it
must cease. That’s all very well, but has
it ceased?
While on the job the committee should
also examine the maritime unions’ prac-
tice of taking-it-out on owners who don’t
“come-across” by withholding crews.

“Mugga Way”: Living in the centre
of diplomatic activity in Australia, Can-
berra residents are constantly exposed
to addresses and lectures on the prob-
lems of other nations. The Chinese
Minister, Dr. Chen, told us the other
night that a major problem for
Nationalist China was the feeding of
more than 10 million people on Formosa,
an island smaller than Tasmania, but
he also stressed the rapid expansion
there of rural and industrial production,
and the establishment of “a pattern of
human liberty and happiness.” National
Librarian Harold White, just back from
Japan, described the physical, economic
and moral recovery of Nippon since the
war and said that Japan was “searching
for friends.” He added that she had
much to offer, culturally, economically,
and in other ways towards international
understanding.


As the most stone-bombarded Vice-
President in U.S. history Richard Nixon
must be wondering how he would have
fared in South America if the ground had
not been prepared for his visit by over 20
years of Good Neighbor policy.

When counting closed for the night in
Saturday’s Flinders (Q.) by-election
Lonergan (Country party) was leading
Forde (A.L.P.) by 185 votes, with Katter
(Q.L.P.) trailing a long way behind.
Figures: Lonergan, 1455 ; Forde, 1270 ;
Katter, 691. Although there were still
more than 1000 votes to come Forde con-
ceded the seat to Lonergan, whose tally
was already greater than his final figure
at the general election. At the corres-
ponding stage of the count last year Forde
was leading by 160 and he subsequently
lost the seat by one vote.
All three parties threw everything they
had into the by-election campaign and the
result is a vote of confidence in Lonergan
and the Nicklin Government. The Q.L.P.
vote is down considerably on last year’s
figure, but is still high enough to be a
prime nuisance to the A.L.P. The North
Toowoomba by-election on May 31 may
not be the foregone conclusion Duggan’s
supporters think it is.

The redrawing of N. S. Wales Assembly
boundaries, which changed Parramatta
from a safe Liberal seat to a probable
Labor seat, Blacktown from safe Labor
to probable Liberal and created a new
seat, Merrylands, which is apparently a
certainty for Labor, seems to have cost
two M.L.A.s their seats.
J. A. Clough (Lib.) decided to switch
from Parramatta and try his luck in
Blacktown. He lost the preselection
ballot. J. S. Freeman (Lab.), sitting
member for Blacktown, met a similar fate
on Saturday when he sought A.L.P. pre-
selection for Merrylands. The endorse-
ment went to L. J. Ferguson.

Six shires in the Lithgow-Bathurst-
Orange district have formed a Citizens
and Ratepayers’ Defence Organisation to
resist the Renshaw Plan for amalgama-
tion of local-governing bodies in that
region. They have convened a public
meeting of protest to be held in the
Masonic Hall, Bathurst, on Tuesday,
May 27. The Renshaw Plan involves the
absorption of Canobolas shire into the
city of Orange ; the absorption of Blax-
land shire into the city of Lithgow ; the
absorption of portions of Abercrombie
and Turon shires into the city of
Bathurst and the amalgamation of their
remains to form a new shire; minor
alterations to the boundaries of Oberon,
Rylstone and Lyndhurst shires.
Objections raised against the scheme
are that it is being imposed on the area
against the wishes of the people ; that it
will strengthen bureaucratic controls;
that the new shires will in every case
be weaker and less efficient than the
old. Residents are urging a referendum
of electors in the shires concerned or an
inquiry by an independent tribunal,
instead of by an officer of Renshaw’s
department, as proposed.

One of the brightest ideas in the Vic-
torian election has been effectively carried-
out by William Downard, L.-C.P. can-
didate for Oakleigh, who has converted
a 27ft. van into a mobile committee-room,
drives seven hours a day round the
expanding electorate six days a week and
has Lib. volunteers at other times to help
electors with advice. He’s a fumiture-
removalist, so the bus was ready to hand.
Downard’s opponent, Val Doube,
Labor secretary in Parliament, holds Oak-
leigh purely on his personal prestige and

Speaking at Dubbo, K. M. McCaw,
Liberal M.L.A. for Lane Cove, said that
if about 700 voters in five shaky Labor
seats switched their votes at the next State
election there would be a change of
Government in N. S. Wales. The seats
referred to and Labor’s majority in each
at the 1956 election were: Dubbo, 436 ;
Young, 359 ; Mudgee, 227; Ryde (new
boundaries), about 100; Rockdale,
about 300.
McCaw appealed for close co-opera-
tion between supporters of the two
Opposition parties. He said that between
them the Liberal and Country parties
would contest the whole 94 seats and in
only 3 —Dubbo, Mudgee and Young—
would the two parties each put up a
candidate. In these electorates there
would be full exchange of preferences.

[From Canberra]
Australia has spent £25,800,000 on the
Colombo plan since Percy Spender first
introduced it in 1950. In all forms of
aid, by far the largest beneficiary has
been India, which up to March this year
had received a total of £9,925,088-worth,
with Pakistan a close second. Even in
the period from July last to March 31
this year £3,891,689 was spent on the
scheme, with India receiving £2,044,004,
Pakistan £959,187, Indonesia £310,477,
Malaya £120,485, Ceylon £100,447, Singa-
pore £82,523, and 10 other countries

Headed for England, Frank (his real
names are Havelock Race) Ashton,
journalist with Sydney “Sun” for 39 years.
He started as that paper’s London
reporter after War I (he’d served with the
Ist Div. Artillery), married a London lass,
came back to Sydney, held various sub-
editorships and was editor for 11 years
till he retired a couple of years back
because of ill-health. In 1946 he was the
“Sun’s” rep. at the Empire Press Confer-

visited the Australian troops in Korea.
Now he’s going to live in England, either
in a flat at Dulwich Village and work in
London, or in a little cottage in the

It brought back old memories (among

Rowe (herewith) when he came

several other equally reputable enter-
prises. He has just been elected to the
Cumberland County Planning body. A
charter-president of Rotary (Drum-
moyne), his main interest outside
business lies with the Civilian Maimed

More than one member of The
Bulletin staff is somewhat annoyed at
Dr. Bruce Hittmann’s decision to retire
from practice in Macquarie Street,
Sydney. True, it is very pleasant and
appropriate that this immense and regal-
looking Viking should be going travelling
and fishing about the Pacific ; but who,
though a gynaecologist, will now cure the
writers and journalists of their ulcers,
over-work, writer’s cramps and other
inevitable disadvantages of their pro-
fession and, what’s more, usually forget
to send-in his bill? He should never
have been allowed to retire ; but since
he has The Bulletin wishes him well,
as will the thousands of new Australians
he has brought into the world at Weewaa,
at Longueville, as senior gynaecologist at
the Royal Women’s Hospital, Sydney,
and, finally, from Macquarie Street.
Likewise, those who saw him row for
Sydney University, those who knew him

After 25 years in State and Federal
politics, Westralian Senatof Harrie
Seward has decided, for health reasons,
not to seek re-election when his term
expires on June 30 next year. A farmer
in the south-west since 1913 (earlier he’d
been a bank-clerk), he joined the A.I.F.
in 1915, was commissioned and appointed
to the 60th Bn. the following year,
was wounded at Polygon Wood in 1917
and invalided to Australia, and re-
enlisted and rejoined the battalion. He
went into the Westralian Parliament as
M.L.A. for Pingelly in 1933, held that
seat for the Country party until the 1950
election, and was Minister for Trans-
port and Railways in the first McLarty
Cabinet. Has been in the Senate since
1951.

By all the rules of the game Wally
Meagher—Francis Wallace is the formal
handle —should have attained celebrity in
the ranks of the flannelled fools instead
of the muddied oafs, for he is a scion of
the famous cricketing family of the
Gregorys. His mother —no mean wielder
of the willow herself—was a sister of Sid
and Charles, both great names in Test
cricket; Charles’s 383 n.o. was a highest
score in Australian first-class cricket for
a few decades before it was broken by
Ponsford. She was, incidentally, the first
child born in the caretaker’s cottage at
the Sydney Cricket Ground.
When_ he was seized by the urge,
Meagher quickly made his mark in top
Rugby Union. He repped for Australia
against N.Z. in 1923, touring again to
the Shivery Isles two years later. He
was in the Waratah team which toured
the British Isles, France and Canada in
1927-28, proving his versatility by filling
the half, five-eighth and centre-three-
quarter positions. As captain of his old
club, Randwick, he was an exponent of
WALLY MEAGHER
the fast, open play which put the “Flying
Greens” at or near the head of the comp,
year after year.
When he retired from top football in
1931 he began the career which ever sine©
has put him in the forefront of the
Union’s top coaches. He groomed the
Australian side which played the Fijians
during their last tour of Australia. He
•still coaches country sides and several
colleges. He was recently honored for
his long services to the game by being
made a life-member of the Rugby Union.

chasing-officer, Meagher, one of Rugby’s
most popular men, pays belated obeisance

At 37 Rupert Steele got home in the
Victoria Racing Club committee by-elec-
tion by a long neck from Geoffrey
Watson, son of the retiring committee-
man, Bob Watson, and two other strong
candidates. V.R.C. by-elections are always
more interesting to Melburnians than
mere political by-elections, and particu-
larly so to racegoers, because retiring
committeemen, unless they resign, are
always re-elected without opposition,
whatever their age.
Steele, a cheerful, personable fellow,
who is managing-director of Steele and
Co., Ltd., furniture retailers in a big way,
has a splendid sporting record: stroke
of two Melbourne Grammar crews, cap-
tain of the school, owner of, among
others, Noble Law, one of the fastest
steeplechasers of all time. As a bomber-
pilot, Steele was shot-down and presumed


killed in Holland, but he turned-up
again after more than two years p.-0.-w.

Passed on in Perth at 91, Alfred Sand-
over, former chairman of directors of
one of Westralia’s oldest and biggest busi-
ness firms. Coming to Perth in 1884 from
Adelaide, he joined an elder brother in
the firm which gradually expanded into
the present business. His active connec-
tion with the concern lasted until he
resigned the chairmanship of directors
nearly a year ago. Outside the business
he took a keen interest in the commer-
cial and industrial life of the State —he
was a president of the Chamber of Com-
merce, an active committeeman of the
W.A. Chamber of Manufactures and of
the W.A. Employers’ Federation, and a
foundation member of the W.A. Univer-
sity Senate. He also had a long associa-
tion with the Boy Scout movement.
Australian Rules footballers will remem-
ber him by the Sandover Medal, which
he instituted as the highest award pre-
sented annually to footballers. Medal-
winners lately expressed their gratitude
when they presented him with his own
special Sandover Medal.

Pat Lawlor: Lean, alert, unsmiling
W. J. Phillipps, noted ethnologist and
registrar of the Dominion Museum,
Wellington, has retired after 41 years’
service. It is presumed he will now work
harder than ever, for he is to add to his
160 scientific books and papers already
published at least one more important
work, Old Maori Culture, Illustrated.
His severe aspect is deceptive. Out of
the goodness of his heart he has helped
many students through the years. He is
an expert on Maori carving and Poly-
nesian art forms and is a carver himself.
His interests extend to N.Z. fishes, about
which he has written important books.
Certainly he will not rust in his

Walter George Whittlestone came a
month ago from Maoriland—-where he
got his D.Sc. —as Reader in dairy-hus-
bandry at Sydney University. He was
in at The Bulletin office the other day

thing from cowshed-design to the funda-
mental physiology of the milking-process.
The latter, he says, is his main interest.
He also likes milk as a drink—though
prefers it with whisky in it.
Walter’s hobby is recorders. There are
two types of these he plays-about with:
the first the recorder (or English flute),
which is popular with the University
Musical Society ; the second an elec-
tronic recorder, which he finds useful in
computing the results of his research.
Electronics is his second hobby, he says.
He learned it from hi-fi and finds it

Most people associate Morris West
with Children of the Sun, the book about
Neapolitan slum-children the Australian
wrote in 1956, which had a great success
when it came out the following year, but
West himself thinks his best work is
The Second Victory, a novel set in
southern Austria, dealing with the impact
of British occupation in a little mountain
town. The Second Victory is already out
in America, will be published in England
in June, and will be on sale here in July.
In between, West has written The Big
Story, a novel with an Italian setting.
Now living at Newport, a pleasant sea-
side spot a few miles north of Sydney,
West was born in Melbourne 42 years

history in N.S.W. and Tasmania before
War II (he's a graduate of the Tas-

ABORIGINALITIES
"MATURE intruded in my kitchen
' chores this week. While defrosting
the refrigerator, I found among the melt-
ing ice a small spider, pure white and
transparent, which appeared to have
frozen to death. But after thawing-out
it came to life, a little creakily at first,
and disappeared behind the sink. Then,
on cutting open a perfectly good pump-
kin, I found that about a dozen seeds
inside it had sprouted and grown stalks
about 2in. long on which leaves were
beginning to form. —“Roni.”

“Myall”: St. Andrew Honeycomb 111,
an A.I.S. cow owned by M. C. Lester,
of Glengallan, Warwick (Q.), is the latest
“Don’t go too close , Nero—they might belong to the R.S.P.C.A .”
winner of Queensland’s highest award
for butterfat-production. During its
seven years of milking the bovine wonder
has produced 39 tons of milk (87,5321 b.)
and 1| tons of butterfat (36561 b.). She
has thus qualified for her name to be
entered in the State’s Elite Register of
Merit and join the august company of
the only other five cud-chewers to notch
36001 b. and over of butterfat in not more
than 10 lactations. Should Honeycomb
keep-up the good work, her total for
that period should be over 2\ tons.

“Curio”: Years ago as a resident of
the Carcoar (N.S.W.) district I knew the
Belubula River quite well, so I was puz-
zled on my return to the Central West
to hear the A.B.C. Regional at Orange
(2CR) refer to the Belabula River. But
it hasn’t changed its name. The Carcoar
spelling is peculiar to that stretch of the
river; elsewhere it is spelt with “a” instead
of “u.” The identification-signs at the
Blayney and Carcoar bridges confirm the
variation.
■** * *
“Keima”: Can’t say what caused those
bays on the U.S. Atlantic coast (B.
7/ 5/ ’5B), but I can say they were not
caused by either “comets” or “meteors.”
Comets are celestial bodies, consisting
of head, or nucleus, and tail, following
in the main fixed orbits (hence the regular
return of, say, Halley’s Comet); and it
is now known that there is no chance
whatever of a comet crashing into the
earth, or vice versa. However, comets
do break-up and disperse, and parts of
a defunct comet may be drawn into the
earth’s atmosphere and become “shooting
stars.” If these fragments burn them-
selves out in the atmosphere and never
reach earth they are meteors; if they hit
the ground, they are known as meteorites.
Hence, meteorites would be the only
possible cosmic cause of the formation
of the bays.
* * * *
“Xavier”: It is claimed that tuna
tastes like chicken, but for piscatorial
perfection I know nothing better than
the abalone, a succulent species combin-
ing the flavor of scallop, crayfish and
turkey. The size of a small table-plate,
this shellfish yields about 6oz. of flesh
which, whether fried (in oil) or grilled,
should first be rolled in seasoned bread-
crumbs or covered in seasoned batter.
Found in rocky, craggy sea-depths, it
can be harvested only by diving and is
therefore expensive and comparatively
rare on Australian tables. The only
place south of the Murray I know where
the abalone is being caught commercially
is off Tasmania’s south coast, where a
rugged character is running a one-man
industry exporting the flesh to Europe
and the East while trying to market the
shell.

“Sevenelms”: Broadcasting agricul-
turists increasingly call our heaviest-
yielding medic “loosen” in disagreement
with old-timers and dictionaries that
rhyme it with “blue fern.” My Swiss
farmer-neighbor says it’s nothing to do
with his home-town by the lake which,
anyway, is pronounced “Lutzeen.”
Unhelpful also was his final information
that in any of the three Helvetian
tongues the word for Strawberry’s pet
snack was alfalfa.

“8.A.K.”: What happens to a wrecked
ship when it sinks? The logical answer
is that it goes straight to the bottom, but
an old seafaring neighbor of my youth
always insisted that in a great many cases
imprisoned pockets of air buoyed the
wreck at a relative depth and held it
suspended between surface and ocean-
floor. I’d never given the matter much
thought until a trawlerman related to
me the mystery of the Kiama. She, it
seems, was a coastal-steamer which sank
off The Entrance (central coast of
N.S.W.) nine years ago. The exact posi-
tion where she foundered is known, and
in the normal way fishermen, only too
aware of what a wreck can do to nets,
would avoid the area as though it were
a minefield. But they don’t. On the
contrary, nets trawled across the spot
where the Kiama sank never suffer so
much as a torn strand. There is only
one possible conclusion: the wreck, like
some unpowered submarine, drifted
away on the currents. Perhaps it is
still going.
“Dune”: Fruitgrowers will regard
“Sevenelms” and his non-fruiting feijoas
(B. 23/4/’5B) as menaces. Commonly
known as the flowering tomato, the feijoa
does fruit on occasion, much to the ire of
the Department of Agriculture, which
regards the fruit as one of the fruitfly's
favored targets and breeding-grounds.

“Baksac”: The Chinese weren’t the
only people who believed that the bird-
of-paradise was legless (B. 7/5/’5B). The
early Dutch seamen actually saw live
birds-of-paradise, yet the description they
took back to Europe was of a beautiful
bird that had neither legs nor wings but
floated through the air on the buoyancy
of its gorgeous plumage; the bird
remained airborne all its life, since con-
tact with the ground killed it. There is
no disputing that the natives removed

the legs from the skins they traded —and
did it so cleverly that detection of the
amputation was impossible. Carl von
Linne —better known as Linnaeus —the
Swedish naturalist, physician, professor
of botany and one of the foremost scien-
tists of the 18th century, was completely

“Dorothy M”: Apt nicknames (B.
7/5/’58)? The father of one of my pupils
works in a plastics factory and is known
at his pub as “Hydraulic Jack.” A cup-
board under my blackboard is stuffed
with plastic-ware of all kinds which
young Jack used to press on me, saying,
“Me father gits ’em for nothin’.” We
had a wonderful time at handwork-
periods with the spoils—until I heard
about his father’s .nickname. The cup-
board is now locked until I work-out
how to dispose of the loot.

“Brick E”: A local alderman and
bigshot was having his home built when
Anzac Day came round. En route to
the march, he was startled to see the
brickies working on his job. He
immediately sought the builder and
pointed-out that it didn’t look the thing
for a man in the public eye to have men
working on his job on Anzac Day. The
builder agreed, but explained that the
brickies had the job on piecework rates
they were sub - contractors and
virtually their own bosses. The owner
returned and interviewed the men. They
were quite pleasant, but not agreeable
to taking the day off. Every member
of the gang, the spokesman said, was
an ex-serviceman, but a holiday on piece-
work meant a day without pay, and what
with the lost time with wet weather,
and so forth . . . Then inspiration came
to the owner. He disappeared briskly and
returned with a dozen. “That'll fix ’em,”
he told the builder triumphantly. “By
the time they get through them they’ll
have the taste and finish the session
up at the pub.” He came back from
the service to find the whole town aware
that men were working on his job. The
brickies were hoorooing, bellowing war-
songs and chucking bricks in like double-
jointed octopuses.
“Cowyard Kate”: “Why buy the hay
if you think it’s too dear?” we asked the
old chap. “You know I’ve gotta have
it to feed me goats.” “Well, why have
the goats?” we asked. “I need ’em for
milk for me nine cats.” “Why not get
rid of the cats?” “I can’t, I need ’em
to keep the mice outta the hay.”

TWO SONGS OF MORNING
I. At Warren.
1 had slept upon the ground,
Blanket of stars and cricket-sound;
Morning found, in a ring-barked tree,
Magpies tossing songs to me.
Pure as fluting, clear as bells,
Notes they played With spun and fell
Whirled and flew, became instead
Gay tomorrows in my head.
Singing bird and early light
Make today a true delight;
Joy it is indeed to find
Tomorrows still within my mind.
II. At Gunnedah
Oh, morning is a fragile thing
That’s spun of dew and swallow’s wing;
And frost that limns the lalique trees
With delicate intricacies ;
Where white like mist the dappled mare
Drinks the dew and grazes air;
And in the grass and on tip-toe
As soft as moths the brown quail go.
So hush, and stay here shadow-still,
Knee-deep in morning on the hill;
For beauty is a fragile thing
That’s spun of dew and swallow’s wing.

ANNE BELL.


A new ZEALANDER, T. Moseby,
from Mataura, fishing off Russell
with two rods, hooked two marlin simul-
taneously. Hopping from chair to chair,
he played them for 45 minutes before
getting 'em over the gunnel. One was a
260-pounder, the other a 230-pounder.
He thus paralleled the feat notched by
Zane Grey in Northern N.Z. waters in
the ’thirties. —““Uramao.”

“P.0.M.C.”: Of course the dropped-
hat dodge would work with the tiger-
snake (B. 7/5/’5B). Barring, perhaps, the
brown around January, the tiger is the
only Australian reptile which always
regards attack as the best defence. Even
the very .young tiger will fight rather
than run; in fact, fire is the one element
or enemy from which it instinctively
retreats.
“Villefair”: But why in the name of
all logic should a snake remain stationary
and hypnotised at the sight of a man’s
hat (B. 7/5/’58)? Of course I’ve heard
the lurk expounded as bushlore hundreds
of times, and nearly as many times been
told how the newchum came back with
his stick, found that Joe had vanished,
and flung the stick away. Then he picked
up his hat —and threw a back-’un on find-
ing Joe curled-up underneath it. But
I’ve never found anybody who could
explain why the object had to be a hat.
Why not any other article of apparel?
Wouldn’t a coat effect the same mesmer-
ism? Or a handkerchief? In actual fact,
a snake is not unduly influenced by any
strange object in its path. If it were, it
certainly would not enter human habita-
tions as blithely as it does.
* * * *
“Motuku”; The great white-breasted
sea-eagles make frequent patrols along
the beach, scavenging for offal, small fish,
or a rake-off from an angler’s haul care-
lessly left uncovered on the sand. I saw
one of the big scavengers dive down
behind the dunes to start a violent out-
cry from half-a-dozen gulls that zoomed
buzzing after him as he regained height.
At first glance I thought that they were
disputing his right to a fish in his talons ;
then I saw it was a gull that he had
seized. He made-off towards the bush
as they went wheeling and screaming
after him. It’s the first time I’ve seen
one attack any kind of bird.
“Sevenelms”: Australian bath-water
going down the waste-pipe “contrari-
wise” is mentioned by Robert Graves in
his latest 5 Pens in Hand. This is the
proposition that south of the Equator
bath-water whirls-out anti-clocKwise,
while north of the line it’s clockwise. It’s
all very fine in theory, but I remember
a lively New Year’s Eve in Pontianac with
our Dutch host demonstrating how his
villa straddled the Equator by the north-
wing guest-bath venting the opposite
way to his own bath in the south wing.
By the time- all those whose vision was
blurred by too many gin -pahits had veri-
fied the phenomenon by throwing
matches into the descending water the
waste-pipes were choked, and our
hostess declared the experiment over. At
this point a sober and pedantic spoil-
sport announced that, as the north bath
had been swirling anti-clock and the
south one clockwise, nothing was proved
except that both baths were acting con-
trary to all true scientific principles.
Intending plug-hole-watchers will likely
find that their bath and kitchen-sink
exhaust clockwise, while their hand-basin
and wash-troughs go anti-clockwise.
* * * •
“Brolga”: The two dogs lay huddled
side by side in front of Joe’s humpy, try-
ing to make the most of the morning sun.
But the nip of the frost was still in the
air and they shivered. Joe’s bob-tailed
cat came round the corner of the hut,
eyed the hounds, then jumped on top
of them and stretched out along their
backs. One of the mongs raised its head
as if to show its appreciation for the
extra blanket; then it relaxed to make
the most of the added warmth. The
huddle didn’t break-up until the sun had
warmed enough to start the fleas moving.

■yuHEN the old hulk Loch Tay was
** towed to her last berth recently at
Port Adelaide (S.A.) to be sold for scrap
after nearly 90 years of service, another
episode in the story of sail ended.
Last of the wool-clippers, Loch Tay
was one of the famous “Loch” Line of
Glasgow, established by William Aitken
and James Lilburn in 1867. The line
employed 27 vessels at various times,
mostly in the Australian trade. The
ships became popular with both passen-
gers and merchants, and catered for
three classes. Usually they carried
general cargo to Australia, and wool on
the homeward trip.
Loch Tay, an iron ship of 1191 tons,
was built by Barclay Curie and Co. at
Glasgow, and launched a few weeks
before the Cutty Sark in 1869. A hand-
some vessel of beautiful proportions, she
went on the Australian run the same
year, in company with five other Lochs,
outstripping her rivals by making the
run in 73 days.
For 20 years, with occasional breaks,
Loch Tay ran in the wool-trade, racing
home with famous clippers like Cutty
Sark and Thermopylae. During the
’nineties she was diverted to South Aus-
tralia, and later, like several of her
sisters, was reduced to barque-rig.
In 1909 she was sold to Huddart
Parker and, minus top-hamper and most
of her fittings, was converted to a coal-
hulk.

According to a report by
the Institute of Public
Affairs (Victoria), -which was
launched in 1943 by business-
men and other Australians to
study economic and industrial
problems, Australian industry
is finding that the measures
persisted with by Canberra in
recent months to achieve
greater cost- and price-stability
have resulted in marked gains
in general efficiency and a
healthier competitive atmo-
sphere in industry.
This is not peculiar to Aus-
fralia, because the peoples of
the world seem suddenly to
have grown tired of never-
ending rises in prices and costs,
and the change in public
attitude towards inflation may
stand out as the most remark-
able economic and social
phenomenon of 1957, paralleled
by a resolute determination by
the Western Governments
to achieve reasonable stability
and to use the economic and
financial weapons necessary for
it.
Although there is no retreat
from the goal of full employ-
ment, there is now a far better
appreciation of the injustices
and hardships (to professional
people, superannuated pen-
sioners, holders of fixed and
near-fixed interest, salaried
workers and investors in
•debentures, who have carried
the burden of inflation for
years) caused by rising prices,
even at the rate of two or three
per cent, a year.
The institute cites three
important economic papers ; n
recent months —by Per Jacobs-
son, managing-director of the
International Monetary Fund ;
by Arthur Burns, former chair-
man of the U.S. President’s
council of economic advisets
and now president of the
National Institute of Economic
Research ; and by Sir Dennis
Robertson, perhaps the first
figure in British economics
today, as a member of the
three-man council appointed by
the LJ.K. Government to make
an independent assessment ot
the state ol the British economy.
Jacobsson reported that
people generally had begun to
recognise the reasons for price-
increases, and that stable money
was something worth-while
making sacrifices for, hus
enabling authorities to take
steps to defend the currency
which only a few years ago
would have been politically
unthinkable.
,
Aso noting the same
tendency in public thinking,
Burns found people had decided
the authorities weie too con-
cerned about the miseries of
depression while neglecting the
injustice and hardship that flow
from inflation ; if the upward
trend of prices were tolerated,
the lives ot millions ot P eo Pj e
would be blighted and the
strength of the entire U. 5.
economy damaged.
Sir Dennis Robertson and his
cS^hafa^™ 1 LZS
and external grounds our
objective should be to stop
inflation, not merely moderate
its course.” Externally Britain
must keep her exports competi-
tive because of her huge import
of primary produce; but tne
case for a halt internally is also
decisive, since creeping infia-
tion effects a redistribution of
income within the community
which is entirely arbitrary and
patently unjust,

It is reported to be “the real
new owner of a controlling-
interest in Australian Fixed
Trusts,” the biggest of the unit-
trust organisations, with which
the name of Patrick and Com-
pany, a firm of Sydney share-
brokers, had previously been
associated. Development
Finance is also said to be part-
owner of the former Bank of
N.S.W. building in O’Connell

Among the large overseas
shareholders in D.F.C. are
Lehman Brothers, a New York
investment-banking partnership
interested in managing U.S.
unit-trusts. Other overseas
shareholders are Prudential
Assurance, Pearl Assurance,
Eagle Star Insurance, Roths-
childs and Philip Hill, Higgin-
son and Co., all of the U.K.
Among the Australian
investors in D.F.C. are Patrick
Nominees Pty., Mercantile
Mutual Insurance and Wash-
ington H. Soul, Pattinson and
Co.
The directors of D.F.C. are
given as J. H. D. Marks, M. T.
Hansen and J. W. Blaiklock,
who are also on the board
of Hansen Consolidated
Industries, Ltd.
W r . E. Bramble and Sons
(Transport) Co., Ltd., has
taken over the interests of
Development Finance Corpora-
tion in the Commonwealth
Handling Equipment Pool
(acquired recently from the
Commonwealth Government),
as well as the interests of
Breckett Pty. and Dickson
Primer. “C.H.E.P.” will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Bramble's, and most of the
former partners in “C.H.E.P.”
will become shareholders in
Bramble's.
Bramble’s is a progressive
concern that began in New-
castle in the transport business
but which has spread (profit-
ably) its activities much further
afield. The materials-handling
equipment it will acquire in
the “C.H.E.P.” deal will marry
very well into its business.
Bramble’s have now made an
offer to take over Morison and
Bearby, a Newcastle iron-
founder and engineer, on attrac-
tive sharemarket terms.
As regards Development
Finance Corporation, its capital
is said to be now in excess of
£700,000. It is also said that
the majority of shares will be
held in Australia, and that the
corporation intends to deal in
association with all share-
brokers.
The advent of the D.F.C.
has, of course, many angles
of interest, and it will be
subject to much attention from
financial and business people
as time goes by.
But not only will increased
interest be taken in the activities
of D.F.C. as plans develop. The
spotlight will also swing with
more persistence to the opera-
tions of unit-trusts generally in
Australia. Already these bodies
are having a profound effect on
sharemarket operations, and
are bringing into the owner-
ship of public companies
crowds of small investors who
previously had no Stock
Exchange investments, direct or
indirect. In the case of unit-
trusts the interest of this archi-
pelago of small investors is
indirect and fairly widely
spread, according to the fixed
or flexible investment-portfolio,
and voting-power is concen-
trated in the trust itself.
There appears to be still a
wide field for the development
of the unit-trust principle in
Australia if overseas trends are
any guide.

Gold and Foreign Exchange
(From Canberra]
AUSTRALIA’S total hold-
ings of gold and foreign
exchange rose by £23.3 million
in the first half of 1957-58, but
this movement was £47 million
lower than the increase
recorded in the first half of the
previous financial year.
The £23.3-million rise repre-
sented an increase in gold-
holdings of £4.4 million and
£18.9 million in holdings of
foreign exchange.
At the end of December last
total international reserves
were £589.8 million, compared
with £566.5 million at the end
of June, 1957, and £425.3 mil-
lion at the end of December,
1956.
Prices for many of Austra-
lia’s exports—particularly wool
—have fallen in recent months.
(During the 10 months to
April 30 last the average price
for greasy wool was -64.8 d.,
compared with 80.8 d. in the
same period of the previous
season.)
In addition, dry conditions
throughout the whole of 1957
have resulted in reduced pro-
duction of many export com-
modities, although meat pro-
duction has increased.
But the effect of these deve-
lopments was mitigated in the
first half of 1957-58 by several
factors, including the export of
larger quantities of wool »and
meat.
Carryovers from previous
seasons permitted exports of
some commodities, notably
barley and wheat, to be main-
tained in spite of reduced pro-
duction in the current season.
Exports exceeded imports by
£57 million in the first half of
1957-58, but after taking
account of the net deficit of
£96 million on invisible trans-
actions a total current-account
deficit of £39 million was
recorded.
There was a substantial in-
flow of capital in the first half
of the year, those from official
loans totalling £4 million net
of repayments; £5B million
came from private sources.
Komewu
[From li. Owen]
A BANDONMENT of Kom-
ewu No. 2 well in Western
Papua should have been anti-
cipated when it was announced,
early in April, that the drill
had entered basement rocks at
the depth of 9950 ft. Never-
theless most of the newspapers
reporting the event are com-
menting gloomily.
Komewu 2 is located about
two miles north-east from
Komewu 1, and some distance
from the Aworra River, near
which the first well was drilled.
At that point basement was
encountered at 6135 ft. and no
oil or gas was recorded.
Both locations are some 60
miles to the west, outside the
“culled” rectangle to which I
have already drawn attention
(B. 7/ 5/’5B), and it is import-
ant to note that formation-
tests in all zones examined in
Komewu 2 have yielded brine.
Apart from the other implica-
tions of this fact, the indica-
lions of the existence of
porous and permeable strata—-
or, at least, of conditions per-
mitting the deposition of such
beds—well outside the limits
of the rectangle, are heartening,
The bores now drilling at
Barikewa, Puri and at Kuru,
particularly the last-named, are
—in my opinion—all more
favorably located than any pre-
vious wells drilled in Papua
with the object of striking
commercial oil and/or gas.

N.Z. Irade and Exchange
TVESPERATELY short of
overseas funds, N.Z. is
beginning to get a little
restive about its adverse
balance - of - trade with Aus-
tralia. The subject will
come up for discussion when
trade-talks between the two
countries are held in a month
or two.
In spite of the understanding
reached between Mr. Holland,
N.Z.’s former P.M., and Mr.
Menzies a year or so ago for
a mutual trade-increase, the
adverse balance from N.Z.’s
point-of-view is worsening. In
1957 N.Z. increased its exports
to Australia by less than
£2 million, while Australia in-
creased its exports to N.Z. by
nearly £ll million. The follow-
ing figures show how rapidly
the deficit has gstown over the
last three years: 1954, £2l
million : 1955, £24 million;
1956, £25 million; 1957, £34
million.
The Associated Chambers of
Commerce have asked con-
stituent chambers to investigate
the desirability of establishing
a free-trade area with Australia.
Meantime, proposals for a
trade-mission to Australia,
shelved early this year because

publicity. Only rumor. Show-
business has, in fact, prac-
tised concealment and sup-
pression. The long-playing
record of the show’s numbers,
withheld from the English
market as if it were danger-
ous contraband, has appeared
in a few secret places, proudly
to be cherished by its smug-
glers or receivers as proof
of up-to-dateness. Not a word
or a note of its content has
dared, even in a whisper, to
be publicly breathed. Yet
advance bookings amounting
to £500,000 have poured into
the box-office.
What accounts for this
mystique? Why should a
musical comedy of unknown
worth so fire the imagination?
These questions can be asked
but not answered, except, per-
haps, by a student of mass-
psychology. Certainly not by
a student of the theatre.
Indeed, the dramatic critic
finds himself in an alien,
inexplicable world. He knows
that the most expensive, the
most glittering and the most
colossal is not necessarily the
best; he prefers straight plays ;
and he goes not where fashion
or whim beckons, but where
the mind directs.
Tremors
So, a little perplexed, this
theatregoer obtained, at a very
high price and then only by
influence, tickets for the second
night of “My Fair Lady” as
long ago as last October, and
tried hard not to be influenced
by the tittle-tattle and bally-
hoo. Quite impossible, because
of the headline news. The
stars, already national figures
in America, were soon to be
marked for idolatry in this,
their own, country. But back-
stage, it was said, was any-
thing but harmonious. Com-
petition for the chorus was,
f or reasons of prestige, the
keenest ever known,
A young man, cast for the
juvenile and thrilled at the
security, got married on the
strength of his engagement,
only to be suddenly dropped
because the transposition of
the songs to the baritone
“Nudes shouldn't move!”
register was not acceptable.
So a tenor had to be found,
quickly. With all the heart-
lessness of the stage, mis-
fortune for one led to romantic
success for another. A
young man from Melbourne,
who in four hard years had
been able to achieve nothing
more than a few TV engage-
ments and who was forced to
earn money clerking at Aus-
tralia House, stepped fittingly
into the part. And, finally,
the principals, with two years’
experience behind them, took
fright at the ballyhoo and had
to be coaxed back to assurance
and confidence by strenuous
rehearsal.
Everything, it seemed, was
getting out of proportion.
Verdict
in the event, “My Fair
Lady” is every bit the success
that was expected. (Even this
plain statement of fact sounds
like an anticlimax.) It should
play for years, if the principals
can overcome the very real
stresses of a long run. It will
continue to make fortunes for
all concerned and it will restore
the rocky finances of Drury
Lane Theatre.
To be fair, the success is
well-deserved and complete.
All types of theatregoers will
enjoy it. Reasons are not diffi-
cult to find. “My Fair Lady”
is a manufactured article of
brilliant original design, sound
workmanship, high quality
and thorough professional

clever and shrewd enough to
tailor his products to the best
markets. Would he have
approved of “My Fair Lady”?
Probably not, since he dis-
credited “Pygmalion” and
loathed any but serious music,
He would, though, have
admired the craftsmanship and
welcomed the royalties (around
£150,000 from America alone).
The team of adaptors, Alan
Jay Lerner (book and lyrics),
Frederick Loewe (music) and
Moss Hart (producer), prove
their status as men of the
theatre by their indebtedness
to Shaw. This is not one of
those adaptations that bear
no relationship to the original.
Whole passages are retained
and the dialogue is unaltered.
Indeed, the best lines and
laughs are Shaw’s. The songs
spring so naturally out of the
action that you are hardly
aware of the music, which in
parts is witty and extremely
clever in its restraint, parody
and pastiche. And, no doubt
intentionally, the lyrics are
unforced and understressed, as
if out of deference to the
master. The production and
effects are essentially simple,
but with that kind of sim-
plicity which comes only from
long experience and careful
working-out.
So sedulously does the show
follow the original that most
of the spectacle is crammed
into the first half, including
Ascot (instead of Mrs.
Higgins’s Chelsea flat) and the
Embassy Ball. Shaw's
characteristic and un-
resolved fifth act
(What will Eliza do?
Whom will she
marry?) has evidently
caused some head-
aches, and the quiet
ending is not convinc-
ing. As in the film,
the inference is that
Eliza will marry
Higgins, but to finish
on a felicitous note the
latter has to play right
against the curtain-
line, “Eliza, where are
my slippers?”
Performance
The famous lapse
from good manners
has also tested the
adaptors. “Not bloody
likely,” being no
longer shocking, they
have substituted a
much coarser expres-
sion. This Eliza
delivers at Ascot
to a person whose middle
obstructs her view, but, pre-
sumably to avoid the giving of
offence, the orchestra drowns
her rebuke! Shaw would have
fumed at these two concessions,
the one to the “ready-mades
and reach-me-downs of the
ragshop in which Romance
keeps its stock of ‘happy
endings’ to misfit all stories,”
and the other to “middle-class
morality.”

One effect of the adaptation
is to reduce the supporting
parts to little more than supers.
Even Mrs. Higgins (played a
little tartly by veteran Zena
Dare) is scarcely allowed to
establish herself. Stanley Hol-
loway’s Doolittle is the fruity
Cockney of the old music-hall
—broad, vulgar, larger than
life and wholly delicious. In
such company the newcomer,
Leonard Weir, is at some
immediate disadvantage as the
vacuous Freddy, but better
definition is on the way.
Robert Coote makes a great
deal of the Dr. Watson-like
Colonel Pickering, even to a
scene of uproarious fooling.
To Eliza, Julie Andrews
brings the qualities of great
acting: she is versatile, affect-
ing and never actressy ; even
when “fit for a duchess” she
is still fundamentally the same
girl as the flower-seller. Pro-
fessor Higgins is an exacting
role. He is a boor who can
get round people, which
implies charm. Here he must
also sing and mime, if not
dance. The part, too, is a
long one. Rex Harrison does
splendidly, even though his
gruffness is unrelieved and he
cannot sing. But he has found
a medium between declama-
tion and sprechgesang which
stings and rejuvenates like a
bursting wave.
Particular attention has been
devoted to the period (1912),
and Cecil Beaton’s costumes
satirically convey the ugly
fashions. Movable stages
speed the production by
eliminating backdrops, and
encores are not given—a fur-
ther act of deference to G.B.S.
since a good half of the musical
numbers are show-stoppers.
Stage and Music
“Time Remembered”
This charming if slightly
overblown fragment by Jean
Anouilh is the Elizabethan
Theatre’s current contribution
to the cause of improving Aus-
tralian drama, and if that con-
nection seems a little strained
it at any rate still makes a very
happy night out.
Margaret Rutherford is the
Duchess whose son loiters
palely with his memories of
the orchid-eating ballet-dancer
who, in a miscalculated drama-
tic gesture, strangled herself
with her own scarf. Darlene
Johnson is the milliner who
bears a striking resemblance to
the late dancer and whom the
Duchess instals in recreated
scenes from her son’s pre-
vious love-affair in the hope of
snapping him out of it.
Anouilh’s infallible sense of
theatre twists and turns this
slim nonsense into two-and-
half hours of delightful enter-
tainment, and if as seen
at the Elizabethan Theatre the
play sometimes hovered be-
tween fantasy and juvenile
fairytale, between French souf-
fle and Yorkshire pud., that
was probably due to a very
matter -of - fact Anglo-Saxon
translation and to Ray Bar-
rett’s performance, which,
acceptable enough in its love-
lorn melancholy, hardly con-
veyed the accents and man-
ners of a polished worldly
princeling.
Certainly it wasn’t the fault
of Miss Rutherford, who swept
through the role with a flourish
of magnificent eccentricities
and unashamedly claimed the
evening for herself. Robin
Lovejoy’s production, deli-
cately preserving Anouilh’s own
particular brand of theatre
magic, aided and abetted her
immensely.
New York City Ballet
Continuing to display its
bright and various wares at
Sydney Empire, the New York
City Ballet came up with
Mendelssohn’s Third Sym-
phony—the “Scotch.”
This is abstract music, and
to it the choreographer, Balan-
chine, has fitted dance-patterns
to match. As with his earlier
symphonic ballet, it succeeds
uncommonly well.
This piece of neo-classicism
was danced with relaxed and
facile grace by Diana Adams
and Jacques d’Amboise, their
effortlessly executed floating
arabesques again being a high-
light of their work. They were
given strong support by a
corps-de-ballet which put quite
a lot of fire into the lively final
movement.
A modern American ballet,
“Pastorale,” music by Charles
Turner and choreography by
Francisco Moncion, was
strikingly original and highly
successful. It told a touching,
simple story of a blind man
who, meditating on his lone-
liness in a grove of trees, is
disturbed by a group of youths
and girls dancing. One girl is
blindfolded; then her com-
panions vanish. Her groping
hands meet those of the blind
man, and they dance
rapturously. When her com-
panions return the girl goes off
with them, leaving the
blind man again to his
thoughts. The chief roles are
beautifully danced by Moncion
himself and Allegra Kent.
“Bourse Fantasque,” to
Chabrier’s music, began as a
gentle satire on ballet over-
elegance, with Patricia Wilde
and Robert Barnett cleverly
keeping exaggeration from
degenerating into farce. The
middle - section prelude was
danced with fine verve and
discipline by Melissa Hayden
and Nicholas Magallanes. The
final section “Fete Polonaise,”
with Allegra Kent and Eugene
Tanner, was all bustling un-
inhibited festivity, very well
sustained.
The least successful of the
four ballets was “Allegro
Brilliante,” based on the Third
Piano Concerto, which Tchai-
kowsky’s death left unfinished.
Like the two symphonies, his
ballet is storyless ; but, whereas
they were sustained by attrac-
tive melodies and strong
rhythmic material, those
qualities are lacking in this
piece. As a result, Balanchine’s
genius for evoking mood and
atmosphere seems for once to
falter. One could, however,
admire the poise and finesse of
Melissa Hayden and the dash
and accuracy of Nicholas
Magallanes and the well-drilled
corps.
In the next programme Miss
Hayden again distinguished
herself in “The Cage’’
(Stravinsky-Jerome Robbins), a
kind of insect-ballet based on
the nuptial cannibalism of
spiders and other antigowal-
Jopitators. The programme
included repeats of “The Duel”
and “Fanfare” the first
standing up even better under
second inspection, and the
other seeming a little thinner —
and “Gounod Symphony”
(Gounod-Balanchine) a light
and pleasant observation of
ballet formalities with nothing
original to say about them.

Munteanu and the “Ninth”
The A.B.C. subscription-
concert at Sydney Town Hall
featured Beethoven’s Symphony
No. 9 (the “Choral”), with
visiting Rumanian tenor Petre
Munteanu, Marjorie Conley
(soprano), Heather Kinnaird
(contralto) and Noel Melvin
(bass-baritone) as soloists.
The thunderous declama-
tions and storm-tossed drama
of the first and last movements
were driven headlong in the
grand manner by conductor
Malko ; the scherzo fizzed and
sparkled right through; and
only the adagio —itself an
uneven piece—fell away in
standard of playing.
All the soloists, singly and in
concert, sang in top form. The
Hurlstone Choir gave good
weight and balance to the
choruses, but too often the
words were put through the
vocal mangle.
Munteanu sang the two big
tenor arias from “Don Gio-
vanni” with effortless delivery,
nice judgment and a good ring-
ing high register, and in the
long leaps in “II Mio Tesoro”
he always landed unerringly in
the middle of the note.
The other offering of the
night was Mozart’s “Haffner”
Symphony, and the reading
gave full rein to its exuberance
and gaiety.

A.B.C. Competition
The N.S.W. finals of the
annual Australia-wide Vocal
and Concerto Competition
were decided at Sydney Town
Hall with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra under
Tibor Paul—and some highly
promising talent came to light.
The judges—Nicolai Malko,
Joseph Post and Tibor Paul —
had no easy task in either
section. Of the four instru-
mentalists, the winner, pianist
Beryl Potter, with a well-
judged and moderately forceful
reading of the first movement
of Beethoven’s “Emperor”
Concerto, could only have been
a point or two ahead of Rhonda
Gillespie, whose playing of tl*e
Busoni transcription of Liszt’s
“Rhapsodie Espagnole” was
dynamic and accurate, her
bravura generating no little
excitement. Maria-Pia Virgona,
the third pianist, was also im-
pressive in her handling of the
lar ghetto-allegro sections of the
Chopin No. 2 Concerto.
Charmian Gadd, the lone
violinist, exhibited a promising
technique in the opening
movement of the Sibelius Con-
certo, but her tone was

Of the three singers, Rosa-
lind Keene won narrowly from
baritone Geoffrey Chard with
a rendering of the “Shadow
Song” from Meyerbeer’s
“Dinorah,” notable for accurate
coloratura and an unusually
rich quality in the middle-
register. Chard’s artistic and
well-phrased version of “Vision
Fugitive” from Massenet’s
“Herodiade” gained him com-
mendation and a chance to
enter the Commonwealth finals
with the State winners. The
third singer, Marion Miller,

beautifully-enunciated render-
ing of the Bell Song from
Delibes’ “Lakme” in a colora-
tura of worth.

“Sayonara”
There’s really no justification
for the inordinate length of this
glossily produced tale of
marriages between U.S. service-
men and Japanese girls. The
film’s attractions lie in the
charm of the Japanese settings
and that of the two Japanese
girls who take the leads,
Miiko Taka and Miyoshi
Umiki, the latter giving a
particularly warm and intelli-
gent performance as an
American airman’s wife.
Marlon Brando is miscast as
an American ace-airman whose
contempt for mixed marriages
is undermined by a Nipponese
beauty. He doesn’t evoke much
sympathy, mainly because of
his churlish presentation of the
character and a Southern accent
which makes most of his lines
practically unintelligible.
A better performance comes
from Red Buttons, as one of
his men who takes the plunge
into matrimony despite all the
snags put up by the authorities.

ment (he can’t go to sea because
he gets seasick), from setting-up
his quarterdeck on a seaside

he declares it a ship and
registers it under the flag of
one of the banana-republics,
and defies ’em, the consequent
pother adding-up to some good
laughs, with the indomitable
skipper always a think ahead
of his comically crooked perse-

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Australian Iron and Steel, Ltd.
COLLATED as they are in November,
annual accounts of the massive Port
Kembla subsidiary of B.H.P. are an
effective mid-term fingerpost to the final
reckoning-out of the parent (which itself
balances in May), since both organisa-
tions are largely contiguous one to the
other in the steel industry. Direct public
interest in A. I. and S. is confined to the
p.c. cumulative prefs., which make-up
£1,000,000 of the £14,500,000 of paid
capital, B.H.P. having bought-up the
ords. in 1935.
The group’s unabated and epoch-
making investment in the Kembla and
Newcastle steelworks (N.S.W.) will have
run to something around the £l6(Lmillion
mark by the early 1960’5, but latest pro-
duction and profit figures from A. I.
and S. indicate little idle capacity in the
8.H.P.-dominated industry. Output in
most categories was at record levels, in-
cluding pig-iron and steel ingots:

1957 .. 1,033,947 1,221,000 1,306,000
The current recession in world demand
for steel will, of course, react on export
sales —amounting to £7 million last year
in the case of A. I. and S. —but the
group looks at present for the bulk of its
receipts to the buoyant and expanding
home economy, although no limits to
future growth are set by production
methods efficient even by the best world
standards.
For the year ended November 30 last,
A. I and S. returned a visible net profit
of £3,895,935 —easily a record. This was
£779,927 higher than that for the pre-
vious term, and was calculated after
providing £4,557,724 for depreciation
(£3,924,724 in 1956) and setting aside
another £2,700,000 towards increased cost
of plant-replacement, or £1,100,000 more
than in 1956. Taxation provided for is

Profit for the ords. ( profit for 8.H.P.)
was £3,820,935, making the earning-rate
on ord. capital last year 28.2 p.c., com-
pared with 22.5 p.c., 15.9, 11.2, 8.9 and
4.7 p.c. back to 1952. This is a healthy
trend indeed, but the unchanged 10 p.c.
ord. div.-rate indicates. that the group’s
present £ 100-million five-year programme
will continue to take precedence over
B.H.P. shareholders, who are not likely
to see any substantial increase in their
present “reasonable dividend” for the
next few years at least.
In investing £3 million last term, A. I.
and S. directed its efforts towards the
development and increased mechanisa-
tion of the company’s South Coast col-
lieries, the completion of a new adminis-
tiative block, and the construction of an
additional 90 coking-ovens, to be com-
pleted next year at an estimated final
cost of £9 million. When this project is
finished, the Kembla steelworks will be
producing more gas than the City of
Sydney.
From an input of about 2,800,000
tons of coal yearly, the new plant will
add 700,000 tons to the present annual
production of blast-furnace coke, as well
as producing by-products such as tars,
light oils and ammonium-sulphate.
Kembla’s growth has been largely at
the expense of Lithgow, where lack of
regional demand since the translation of
steel-making from one centre to the other,
disproportionate transport costs and the
unsuitability of its output for coking pur-
poses resulted in the ending of activity
last June at the Lithgow colliery, which
had been operated by A. I. and S. since
incorporation in 1928.
Most of the present construction pro-
gramme is being undertaken by 8.H.P.,
which completed its horizontal expan-
sion over virtually the whole field of
basic steel-production by commission-
ing last July at a cost of £8 million a
hot-dip tinplate mill with an initial capa-
city of 70,000 tons, which Will be sup-
plemented within the next 18 months by
the construction of a stainless-steel sheet-
and-strip mill by another B.H.P. offshoot,
Commonwealth Steel Co., Ltd.; and last
month a steel slabbing-mill, built at a
cost of 8f million, went into operation.
A fourth blast-furnace, costing about
£9 million, will add its 12,000 tons
weekly capacity to production some time
next year.
Close of accounts showed a rise of
£12.7 million in the co.’s total assets,
with an especially prominent increase in
liquids. The cash or near-cash holdings,
now £12,038,651, are required to meet
contractual commitments for the mainly
imported plant and equipment required
for the coking-plant:

On the other side of the balance-sheet,

Moulded Products (A/asia), Ltd.
'T'HE development of new plastic mater-
-*• ials and the increasing—and seemingly
limitless—uses to which plastics can be
put continue to add to the already attrac-
tive prospects of the plastics industry.
The local production of many of the
synthetic resins covered by the generic
ferm “plastics” now affords manufac-
tuiers of plastic goods a degree of pro-
tection against possible restrictions on
the importation of raw materials and,
while the remarkable rate of growth dis-
played over the last decade may give
way, for a time, to expansion on a less
spectacular scale, sections of a large
potential market are as yet untapped.
Biggest manufacturer of plastic goods
in Australia, Moulded Products (Austral-
asia), Ltd., has participated fully in the
lusty growth of the industry over the
post-war years. Originally an offshoot of
Dunlop Rubber, the co. was passed over
to private interests in 1936, six years after
formation, the public being offered a
share-interest in 1939. Since then paid
capital has leapt from £24,502 to
£1,394,951 (including £408,125 in p.c.
prefs.), the most recent issue to share-
holders, one-for-two at a 50 p.c. pre-
mium, occurring in 1955.
The only bonus-issue during this period
was in the form of compensation to pref.
shareholders affected by adjustments to
the pref. div.-rate. A steady 14 p.c. has
been paid on the ords. for each of the
last eight years.
The absorption of rival or allied con-
cerns has helped to swell share-capital,
the purchase of W. F. Birch Pty. in 1952
and Amalgamated Plastics (A/asia), Ltd.,
in 1953 preceding the exchange, in 1956,
of 520,000 ss. ords. for the ord. capital
of Pierwood Plastics, Ltd., a Sydney-
based injection-moulder.
The group now consists of the parent
co. and 16 subsidiaries, all of the manu-
facturing offshoots, with the exception of
Pierwood Plastics, being located in Vic-
toria. The host of plastic and plastic-
coated products turned-out by the group
and distributed by its Australia-wide
sales-organisation includes agricultural
and industrial piping, insulated wires and
cables, vinyl-coated fabrics, laminated
sheet and tubing, polythene film, rain-
wear, toys, floor-tiles and domestic uten-
sils. A plastic-laminated decorative-hard-
board and a styrene foam were added to
the range last term.
Stiffer competition was encountered
during the year to December 31 last, and
turnover, up 6| p.c., increased at a slower


rate than in the 1956 term when a 20 p.c.
gain was reported. Extremely dry wea-
ther affected trading conditions, causing
unexpected variations in the demand for
some lines (such as raincoats, the plastic
film used in their manufacture, garden
hose, water-pipes, etc.), but all sub-
sidiaries operated profitably, further
advances in manufacturing- and distri-
buting-techniques contributing to a
£47,731 improvement in net earnings:

Maintenance of the 14 p.c. ord. div.-rate
was a relatively simple matter, divs., both
pref. and ord., claiming only 51 p.c. of
the record £316,641 profit. Written after
providing £184,297 (down £17,377) for
taxation and £256,778 (up £32,534) for
depreciation, the earnings covered the
pref. div. and 29.9 p.c. on average ord.
capital, compared with 26, 36.7, 27.9 and
27.7 p.c. in the four years back to 1953 —
an encouraging performance, considering
the 91 p.c. increase in ord. capital over
the last three years.
Extensions to the main Mentone (Mel-
bourne) works were completed last term,
and, with the installation of several
large items of plant, capital-expenditure
exceeded £500,000. Depreciation left the
net addition to the book-values of plant
(cost-/ess-depreciation) and freeholds
(cost) at £247,938. The net increase in
liabilities, however, was only £87,785,
scrip to a face-value of £35,138 being
issued, at a total premium of £70,084, as
consideration under building-contracts.

Share-capital should reach £1,646,638 on
June 30 next, options issued with the
£251,687 of 6 p.c. notes entitling holders
to take up 1,006,750 ss. ords., at a pre-
mium of 2s. 6d. a share on that date.
Share-premium reserve will then amount
to £475,882, or nearly 40 p.c. of ord.
capital. The options are currently fetch-
ing around Bs.
Taking into account the impressive
earning-record, the wide dividend-cover
and the sizeable accumulation of share-
premiums, shareholders may well expect
to see a larger slice of the profits come
their way within the next few years. The
timing of any bonus-issue or lift in the
div.-rate would depend, of course, on
what plans the directors have in mind
for further expansion.
At 16s. the f.-p. ss. ords. would
return £4 4s. 2d. from a 14 p.c. div.,
capitalisation of the sharemarket-pre-
mium giving an earnings-yield, on last
term’s figures, of £9 10s. lOd. p.c. Net
tangible asset cover at December 31 last
was 10s. 9d.
Gibson and Howes, Ltd.
TTIGH export-prices, the suspension of
export-quotas and an overall
improvement in sugar-yields all helped
to lift the value of last season’s Austra-
lian sugar output by £5.6 million to a
record £62 million, tne 1,290,000 tons
(94 n.t.) of raw sugar produced being
exceeded only by the 1954 season’s
record-breaking outturn. The price of
sugar for home consumption was steady
over the year.
The export-quota provisions of the
International Sugar Agreement were
inoperative during the greater part of
1957, poor beet-crops in Eastern Europe
and elsewhere keeping the world market-
price of sugar above the price-'fange
within which quotas are enforced, for 10
months of the year. As a result, exports
of raw sugar jumped by approximately
14 p.c. to 767,832 tons, the sale of
100,000 tons of raws to Japan accounting
for a portion of this increase.
Export-earnings were also strength-
ened by an increase of £stg.l Bs. 4d. to
£stg.42 3s. 4d. a ton, in the “negotiated
price” payable under the British Com-
monwealth Sugar Agreement. Among
other things, this agreement, which
functions within the framework of the
international agreement, provides for the
export of around 300,000 tons of sugar
a year at a price subject to annual
negotiation and revision.
Though the Australian sugar industry
as a whole in 1957 had a highly-successful
season, near-drought conditions in
southern Queensland led to much lighter
crushings of cane in that area and a
sharp reduction in output.
At Gibson and Howes’ Bingera plan-
tation and mill (Bundaberg, Q.) the
total rainfall for the 1957 season was
only 17in. as against an average annual
fall of 40in., the tonnage of cane crushed
by the co. during the season dropping
from 359,325 tons to 189,760 tons:
Cane Crushed, Raw Sugar Produced,
Season. Tons. Tons 94 n.t.
1952 .. 197,820 22,812
1953 .. 308,755 37,900

1956 . . 359,325 45,450
1957 . . 189,760 25,350
At 25,350 tons (down 20,100 tons) the
production of raws was the lowest for
five years.
Local sugar-mills are allotted produc-
tion-quotas, or “mill-peaks,” and receive
a price for their quota-sugar based on
the average price obtained for all quota
or “No. 1 Pool” production. Sugar
produced in excess of quotas is bought
at a much lower figure. In Gibson and
Howes’ case, an increase in last season’s
mill-peak, from 37,000 tons to 39,000
tons, was of little help to the co. (sugar
production falling 13,650 tons short of
the new peak), but improved export
prices raised the No. 1 pool, and overall
average prices by an estimated £1 Bs. 3d.
a ton and £1 7s. 6d. a ton respectively:

Final prices for the 1956 season were
well above early estimates, and inclusion
of the added income in the accounts for
the year to Dec. 31 last limited the drop
in net earnings (down for the third
successive year) to £7887, despite the big
reduction in output:

At 12 p.c. on share-capital, compared
with 13.2, 14.3 and 15.8 p.c. in the
three years back to 1954, the £75,669
profit was reckoned after providing
£56,103 (up £3011) for depreciation and
an unspecified amount for taxation.
Shareholders were last asked to put-
up additional capital in 1951, a one-for-
two par issue in that year being followed,
in 1954, by a one-for-two bonus-issue
financed by a revaluation of fixed assets.
A steady 12 p.c. div. has been paid on
the bonus-enlarged capital, last term’s
distribution absorbing all but £69 of the
profit claimed by the board.
A high level of capital-expenditure was
maintained last year, the installation
(still in progress) of bulk-handling equip-
ment and completion of a 10-mile
extension to the tramway-system con-
tributing to the £137,088 increase in the

After a none-too-promising start crops
in the Bundaberg district have benefited
from good rains over the last three
months, and, at this stage, Gibson and
Howes appears to have a good chance
of recovering the ground lost last term.
World prices for sugar have returned to
the levels prevailing in mid-1956, but the
negotiated price for 1958 under the
British Commonwealth Agreement has
been raised by £stg.l 13s. 4d. a ton.
The bulk-storage and -loading terminal
at Bundaberg’s new deep-water port will
be completed in time to handle sugar
produced at Bingera during the 1958
season, and, with further extensions to
the co.’s tramway-system under way,
some reduction in handling-costs can be
expected.
At 455. the f.-p. £1 ords. would return
£5 6s. Bd. p.c. from a 12 p.c. distribution,
the net tangible asset cover, at December
31 last, amounting to 28s. 9d.
Raleigh Preserving Co., Ltd.
RALEIGH’S accelerated turnover,
higher by 20 p.c., last term seems to
have been won largely in the highly
competitive and only moderately re-
munerative export-field ; and by the time
heavier costs, markedly higher in the case
of fruit, had been totted-up, net profit
for the year (to Dec. 31 last) failed to
match up to the record, albeit moderate,
earning-level reached in the previous
term.
In the nine years immediately follow-
ing Raleigh’s incorporation in 1932
output was confined to tomato-sauce.
War-time demands, however, brought a
launching-out into fruit-, vegetable-,
meat- and soup-canning activities, which
have been steadily expanded to the
present sizeable scale. Approximately
half of the production of the two well-
set-up Victorian factories finds an outlet
in overseas markets, widest of which is
the U.K., with Far East and Middle
East countries also taking their regular
shipments. Unable to obtain regular and
“adequate” supplies of board, a carton-
manufacturing offshoot, Raleigh Con-
tainers Pty., ceased operations last term.
First listed in 1950, after the public had
come to light with £90,000 of fresh ord.
capital, Raleigh put out a one-for-two
par issue in 1951, taking paid capital to
£300,000, of which £30,000 carries a
cumulative 5 p.c.
The “high turnover, low profit-margin”
basis, on which many food-processors
operate, tends to make earnings sensitive
to the prevailing economic wind, as shown
by the erratic behavior of Raleigh’s earn-
ing-percentages on ord. capital in its
early years as a public co. From 16.7
p.c. in 1950, the rate dropped to 13.3 p.c.
in 1951 and 8.4 p.c. in 1952, and annual
showings since have been 3.6, 11.7, 14.1
and 13.7 p.c. up to 1957.
Despite a record output of over
22-million cans, which brought sales to
around the £1.5-million mark, net profit
slipped back by £1059 when compared
with the 1956 term. The £38,522 of earn-
ings was reckoned after setting aside
£16,024 (down £2293) for depreciation
and providing £27,382 for taxation (up
£557):

Although the profit as shown in the above
table includes a £13,250 “write-back of
provisions made in prior years—no longer
required,” the tax-provision, in the
absence of detailed background informa-
tion, suggests that taxable income was
somewhat higher than that of the
previous term.
Maintenance of the 8 p.c. div.-scale left
the average ord. div-rate as a public
co. at a shade over 6.4 p.c.
The decline of working-capital arising
from an expanding turnover and addi-
tions to plant and premises was countered
last year by a £50,000 mortgage-loan and
funds in the form of deposit-money
which shareholders were invited to invest
for periods of up to two years.
At balance-date, £31,463 of the £50,392
of deposits was repayable within 12

THE BRITISH PETROLEUM COMPANY
SATISFACTORY RESULTS FOR 1957 DESPITE
DIFFICULT TRADING CONDITIONS
THE 49th annual general meeting
of The British Petroleum
Company Limited will be held
on May 22 in London.
The following is an extract from
the Statement by the Chairman, Sir
Neville Gass, K.8.E., M.C., which
has been circulated to Stockholders.
Our Group Income Statement for
the first six months for 1957, pub-
lished in September last, showed
net income one-third less than in
the same period of 1956, because
of the lower sales and higher
expenses caused by the Suez crisis.
For the whole year of 1957, as
forecast last December in the
prospectus for our Convertible
Debenture issue, Group sales ton-
nage and net income approximate
closely to those for 1956, a satis-
factory result considering that the
adverse effects of the crisis had
to be sustained for a longer period
in 1957 than in 1956.
Difficult trading conditions
already referred to make it more
than usually hazardous to attempt
at this early stage to forecast how
results from our 1958 operations may
compare with those for last year.
Having had no increase in sales
tonnage in 1957, we are hoping tor
higher figures in 1958; for the
twelve months ended 31st March,
1958, our sales amounted to over
57 million tons compared with 53
million tons in 1957.
In the consolidated profit and loss
account, the trading profit, after
providing for depreciation and
amounts written off, totals
£113,947,431 for 1957, compared
With £124,171,691 for 1956.
Depreciation and amounts written
off total £30,268,330, compared
with £25,202,874 for the year 1956,
the increase being mainly in the
amount written off exploration
interests, due to increased expendi-
ture in 1957 in searching for new
sources of oil, and in the increased
depreciation arising from the
expenditure on the expansion of
the Kent Refinery.
The total taxation is £67,611,925,
of which £63,573,173 is overseas
taxation, arising mainly in Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and Trinidad.
Your Directors have recom-
mended a final dividend on the
Ordinary Stock of 2/-d. per £1
stock unit free of income tax,
making a total for the year of
3/-d. per £1 stock unit free of
income tax. They consider that
no increase in dividend should now
be paid in view of the disturbed
conditions which have developed
in the world oil markets.
The Revenue Reserves now total
£151,549,632, having been increased
this year by a total of £33,358,886.
Your Directors recognise that
Reserves have reached a level which
calls for measures of capitalisation
of reserves in part, and they con-
template recommending such action
later in the year unless unforeseen
conditions arise.
Production and Refining
In 1957 our main sources of
crude oil were again Kuwait, Iran,
Iraq and Qatar, from which we
obtained some 48,700,000 tons. By
reason of the Suez crisis this was
about 1,000,000 tons less than in
1956, but still some 3,000,000 tons
more than in 1955, the last normal
year.
In Papua drilling under most
difficult conditions has continued,
two wells being completed and two
more begun; though they have
given further evidence of natural
gas, none of them has proved the
presence of an oilfield. In these
circumstances we and our partners
are taking careful stock of the
position, as continuance of this
enterprise will largely depend on
the results of the wells now drilling.
In Australia, despite widespread
effort by many companies, no com-
mercial oilfield has yet been dis-
covered. Last year we participated
in drilling one well in Queensland;
we also continued our work of
geological and geophysical surveys
in parts of Queensland, New South
Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
In the North Island of New
Zealand geological and geophysical
surveys continued throughout the
year.
During the early part of 1957
BP Group refinery throughputs and
also our processing arrangements at
other refineries were seriously affected
by the dislocation in crude oil
supplies caused by the closing of
the Suez Canal and interruptions
to the Iraq Petroleum Company’s
pipeline deliveries to. . the Mediter-
ranean. In the circumstances it is
satisfactory to record that our total
throughput for the year of 32,100,000
tons was only 400,000 tons less than
in 1956.
On the Continent of Europe our
throughputs were also reduced,
crude oil processed at the six BP
Group refineries amounting to
8,300,000 tons compared with
9,500,000 tons in 1956.
In Australia throughput of our
Kwinana refinery was 2,287,000
tons, compared with 2,304,000 tons
in 1956. A start has been made
on the erection of a second cata-
lytic reformer for the manufacture
of additional high-grade motor
spirit.
Major expansion in the Group’s
activities for the manufacture of
chemicals from petroleum in the
United Kingdom, France and Ger-
many took place during the year.
In the United Kingdom, the three
companies in which BP participates
have operated very satisfactorily
with all manufacturing units main-
taining a high output of intermediate
petroleum chemicals. When plants
now being built are completed, the
production of chemicals at Grange-
mouth will approach 200,000 tons
per annum.
Distribution and Sales
The BP Group’s sales of crude
oil and refined products in 1957
totalled, as in 1956, approximately
53 million tons; a reduction in the
first half of the year, due to the
effects of Suez, was made good
during the second half of the year.
In the United Kingdom consump-
tion of petroleum products, severely
curtailed in the early months of
the year by the motor fuel ration-
ing schemes and other restrictions
in force from December, 1956, to
May, 1957, showed a decrease of
21% in 1957, compared with an
increase of in 1956. Our
associated marketing company,
Shell-Mex and B.P. Limited, main-
tained their leading position in the
market, their sales showing only a
small decrease in line with the
decrease in consumption.
Our trade on the Continent of
Europe was also affected by supply
difficulties and restrictions on con-
sumption, and for the year our
deliveries fell short of the 1958
level by some 7%.
East of Suez our markets were
not subject to the same restric-
tions. Our marketing company in
Australia, which last year changed
its name from The Commonwealth
Oil Refineries Limited to BP
Australia Limited, had a successful
year’s trading and achieved an
increased share of the market.
In New Zealand the development
of BP (New Zealand) Limited's
plans to expand its organisation
made good progress, and its share
of the market increased.
In Canada BP Canada Limited
opened its first service station to
the public in May, and since then
has continued to expand its activi-
ties in the highly-competitive
Canadian market where its appear-
ance as a marketer has had an
encouraging reception.
The BP International Oil Bunker-
ing Service was also considerably
affected in the early months of the
year by the Suez emergency and in
the latter part of the year by a
slackening in world shipping
activity. . Despite this our bunker
sales reached a level equivalent to
the average of the preceding two
record years.
BP Aviation Service has further
extended its field of operations and
our sales of aviation fuels have
continued to increase. The demand
for BP Energol branded lubricants
continues to increase.
In North Africa we have acquired
an independent marketing organi-
sation in Algeria which will assist
in developing our existing business.
As reported last" year, both the
Commonwealth Trans - Antarctic
Expedition and its New Zealand
contingent were exclusively sup-
plied with BP petroleum products.
We are proud of having contri-
buted to the historic achievements
of Dr. Fuchs and Sir Edmund
Hillary, and that the party which
made the first land-crossing of the
Antarctic included one of BP’s
geophysical staff. The Australian
National Antarctic Research Expedi-
tion has also been exclusively
supplied with BP products.
In the field of motor racing every
Formula I Grand Prix race count-
ing for the World Championship
in 1957 was won on BP products.
This is a remarkable achievement
unequalled hitherto.
Personnel
It is much more than a conven-
tion that this statement should end
with an expression of thanks to
the Group’s personnel, for the
success of our operations is prin-
cipally due to the enthusiasm and
ability of the whole body of our
employees. I am sure, therefore,
that you would wish me on your
behalf to record our high apprecia-
tion of their work wherever they
may be.

From Herbert Holman
TPHE chilliest spring for half-
-*■ a-century has broken.
Retarded trees have burst
suddenly into blossom and
flower-beds into color. Happily
and unusually, this late recovery
has coincided with the opening,
in brilliance, of the cricket
season. Rarely does the tradi-
tional match at Worcester
against the tourists take place
at a temperature which makes
them feel at home ; and rarely,
too, on that occasion does a
home-batsman score a fast
century on the first day.
Other aspects of our summer
game are rather less happy.
Why, for instance, cannot great
cricketers of the past let by-
gones be bygones? Or at least
confine their recollections to
the field of play? It is, perhaps,
no coincidence that on the
eve of the season’s opening the
sporting-pages should ring
with controversy and indigna-
tion over certain passages in
a newly-published book by our
most recent great cricketer of
the past, Denis Compton. The
timing, one suspects, is not
accidental.
And the main point of con-
troversy, the personality and
capacity of the author’s captain,
Len Hutton, under Test Match
stress, is a singularly unfortu-
nate issue when these two fine
sportsmen have together played
many a valiant innings and won
many a day for England.
One wonders, too, what there
is about the game which
engenders authorship, for every
well-known cricketer seems to
be as handy with the pen as
with bat or ball or gloves. Also
remarkable is the apparent ease
with which ex-cricketers can
adapt themselves to the sport-
ing-columns of the popular
press, normally the stronghold
of skilled professionals of quite
another genre. Which is only
to say, perhaps, that cricketers
are more themselves in the
field than at the desk; and
there —in the field —is where
most of us wish to see them,
or remember them.
As so often happens, the
impeacher can, by his own
act, become the impeached. If
Compton is not by now sorry
that he made his accusations
he must be quite insensitive.
This is hardly likely, since he
turned-out during the height
of the controversy for the
Prime Minister’s XI —under the
captaincy of Len Hutton.
Turntable Talk
Six years ago there were only
nine makes of gramophone
records. The H.M.V. label was
then still restricted to the old-
fashioned 78 r.p.m. disk, and
the long-playing issues were
nearly all from the Decca
company or its associates.
Now there are 21 listed
makers for serious music
alone. There are, for
example, 17 recordings of the
Brahms First Symphony, 14 of
the Tchaikovsy B-flat minor
Piano Concerto and nine of the
Beethoven “Waldstein” sonata.
And the classical section is,
according to the trade, a matter
of prestige, not necessarily of
profit. The fantastic growth
of the industry in the last few
years is substantially due to the
hit-parade, to the demand for
“pop” music and to the
abundant cash which burns the
pockets and purses of young
people between the ages of 16
and 25.
Riches are being accumulated
on every side, from the latest
teenage discovery (and, not to
be ignored, his promoters) to
the manufacturers of record-
players and accessories
although the shareholders of
one reputable and go-ahead
concern suffered an unpleasant
shock recently through its
expanding too fast.
A comparatively new
development is the mail-order
record-club, privately and some-
what mysteriously organised
to supply disks at rather more
than half the normal price
(225. 6d. to 255. for a 12in. 1.-p.
record, compared with 40s. to
41s. 9d.). The entry into this
field by such an unexpected
alien as the Rank Organisation
presents a serious challenge to
the two big producers, Decca
and E.M.I. For the clubs will
operate from nearly 500
cinemas, many of whose former
restaurants are now used for
teaching dancing, thus bring-
ing competition down to shop-
level ; and Ranks, of course,
are well placed to establish a
corner in artists’ services.
Decca are countering by re-
issuing, at a cheap price, some
early recordings under a new
label, Ace of Clubs.
Of more interest to lovers of
serious music is the E.M.I.
“sampler” scheme. These are
45 r.p.m. records giving excerpts
from longer works. The idea
is that the potential customer
who doesn’t quite know what
he wants borrows them and
plays them in the quiet of his
own home.
Worsted
“Any Other Business” (West-
minster Theatre) is an unusual
play insofar as the “hero” is a
corporate body—the board of
management of a worsted-mill
—and the dramatic issue is the
impact upon this sober conclave
of a piece of villainy in the
shape of an unscrupulous but
nicely-timed takeover bid.
Hardly, at first sight, the
makings of an entertaining
evening? There lies the sur-
prise, always a powerful
element in the theatre. This
play is interesting, amusing,
thrilling and satisfying despite
the fact that it deals with such
untheatreworthy topics as
agendas, minutes, share-
transfers, returns and other
day-to-day matters —even the
folly of not keeping dividends
more in line with earnings!
That the joint - authors,
George Ross and Campbell
Singer, are professionally well
equipped so to blend business
with pleasure is clear enough,
since the one is an accountant
and the other an actor, but the
marvel is that their neat and
skilful collaboration comes off
so well in terms of the theatre,
They take their time, after
a quiet start, to set an authentic
yet engaging atmosphere and to
introduce: the efficient, “top-
drawer” secretary (the only
woman in the cast); the tactful,
well-informed chief accountant;
the eccentric but indispensable
technician ; the founder’s son,
a forthright but stubborn
managing-director ; the brash
sales-director; the suave chair-
man, a man of affairs from the
south; the diffident mill-
manager ; and, finally, the
“mistake,” a seedy M.P.
originally appointed to give
weight to the board.
These men go methodically
and unconcernedly about their
business, with that confident
nonchalance which apparently
is the perquisite of successful
men, until the unscrupulous
marauder (“the rudest man in
Yorkshire”) arrives both to
lay down his hand and to
provide a very strong curtain to
the first act.
The play then becomes a
“whosprungit.’’ There has been
a leakage of information.
Moreover, the traitor is one
of themselves. Each in turn, is
shown to offer grounds for
suspicion and the focus is
cleverly switched from one to
another. A trap is set to go
off shortly before the zero-
hour of takeover and the culprit
(which is it going to be?) is
duly caught. The denouement
must not be revealed but is
unexpected, and the ending is
a happy one if, perhaps, slightly
more fairy-tale than big
business. At least, right
triumphs and, as expected, the
villain is overthrown and made
ignominious.
Although severely confined
by its limits, Anthony Sharp’s
production is pertinent and
imaginative (he makes effective
use not only of clever group-
ing and changes of lighting but
also of simple properties such
as boardroom chairs, scribbling-
pads and, most dramatically,
the intercom.).
The actors have earned their
promotion from Sunday-night
repertory, but a few have still
to achieve the right degree of
balance. When the chairman
(superbly played by Raymond
Huntley) is not present the
dramatic value falls but then
this heaven-sent role dominates
the play. Here is the perfect
chairman of companies, con-
fident, quiet, tolerant, imper-
turbable, quick of grasp, strong
of character, influential and,
above all, well-bred.


Fencing
By ROGER V. CARR
v—vLD Thompson wants
I lus to put in a fence
for him, boys. Couple
of quid in it for you.”
“Gee, thanks,” said John,
*T suppose you’ll only get
about forty.”
“Do you want to do it or
don’t you?”
“No,” said John, which
rocked Dad, “but I will.”
John had it all worked-out.
He had a choice. So long as
he came and helped with the
fence he could either like it or
not.
“Posts are around there,”
said Dad, “but you had better
take the tractor and trailer
for the wire and things.”
“When do we leave?” asked
John.
“Now. He’s in a bit of a
hurry, the old fence is nearly
down.”
“0.k.,” said John. “We’ll give
you a yell when we've got the
load on.”
“Don’t bother ; I’ve got one
or two jobs round here before
I leave. I’ll follow you in the
ute. later.”
“Yes,” said John as we went
out the door ; “it might rain.”
TT7E went over to the shed and
” hooked-up the tractor and
the trailer. Then we threw the
posthole-digger and the wire
up.
“Better get some chains to
rip the old fence out with,”
said John.
We hunted around the shed
and found a couple of heavy
trace-chains, throwing them
onto the trailer with a shovel
and crowbar.
John hunted around some
more, coming back with an old
tarpaulin and some super.-
bags. He threw the bags onto
the trailer, flattened them out,
and climbed up.
“Give us a yell when we’re
ready to start work,” he called,
lying down on the bags and
pulling the tarp. over himself.
Tom climbed onto the
tractor and with me on the
front of the trailer we started
down the drive.
The wet, yellow sand of the
road hissed under the wheels
as we bounced along, the
engine roaring. We skidded
back and forth across the road
as Tom practised his racing
driving.
Anything less than a tractor
would have turned over with
the first wild swing of the wheel.
We came to the corner, changed
down with a jerk and a grind,
changed up with the same
results, and swung round. The
tractor churned up mud, rocked
wildly, and kept going. The
trailer bucked crazily across
the road.
“You silly little no-hoper!”
yelled John.
He had been thrown against
a coil of barbed-wire. He stood
up on the trailer and yelled.
Tom looked round, saw John,
and, using past experience as a
guide, pulled the throttle back
and dived for the road, to
come-up running across the
paddock.
John hopped off the trailer
and caught-up with the still-
moving tractor. He climbed
into the seat and we drove on.
Tom would head for home.
He didn’t want to do any work,
but only came for the chance
to drive the tractor.
TOHN swung across the cattle-
J ramp and down Old
Thompson’s drive. We went
through the bottom gate and
out into the paddock, down to
the fence.
“Phew,” whistled John when
we pulled-up beside the fence
we had to replace ; “only just
got here in time.”
The wire was rusted through
in most places, the posts were
just shells eaten-out with rot.
A few minutes later the ute.
swung through the gate and
came slithering down the
paddock.
“Shove the holes in five-feet
out from the old posts,” said
Dad without getting out of the
car.
He turned the ute. round and
started back up the paddock.
John looked resignedly at him
as he disappeared. We un-
hooked the trailer and fixed the
posthole-digger to the tractor.
I went along measuring sft.
out from the posts while John
came behind and drilled them.
“Well, what d’you know!”
said John as he started on the
last hole.
Dad was coming down the
paddock.
“Ready for the posts?” he
asked.
“Yes.”
He climbed out of the car
and the three of us heaved the
first post into its hole and threw
in the dirt. John packed it
down with a crowbar while Dad
stood back to see if it was
straight.
“0.k.,” he called. “Next.”
John and I picked-up the
post and dropped it into the
hole.
“You pack this one?” John
asked Dad.
“Gotta watch you get them
in straight.”
Dad was leaning over the
first post, head in his hands.
“Don’t strain yourself,” said
John.
We sat post after post in
their holes, packing in the dirt
when Dad said they were
straight. The last one went
in just before lunchtime. We
climbed into the ute. and
started home.
John told Dad how Tom had
dived off the tractor and belted
across the paddock.
“Must’ve got it from me,”
said Dad. “When I was a bit
younger I could run a rabbit
down, easy. Still can run fast,
too; never seem to get time,
though.”
We climbed out at the house
and started in. Tom was by
the door looking hard at John,
ready to run.
“G’day,” said John.
“ ’Day.”
Tom decided to risk it and
went inside with us.
A FTER dinner we started
laying-out the two lines of
barbed-wire. Two along the
top, then a roll of rabbit-
netting.
We laid the wires out and
tied them to the end post.
Dad stayed up the top-end and
worked the wire-strainer on the
barbed-wire lines, pulling them
both tight.
“Blast,” said Dad when we
got back, “I only brought two
hammers.”
“That’s 0.k.. Dad,” said
John. “I don't mind not having
one.”
“The one I left behind,” said
Dad, “was mine.”
John took the hint, and with
a pocketful of staples each we
started hammering the wires
to the posts.
Dad grabbed one of the bags
from the trailer, folded it
neatly, put it down beside his
end post, and sat down.
“Hey,’ he yelled, “get us
another bag, one of you.”
John hooked his hammer
to the wire and walked back.
He picked-up one of the bags
and took it over.
“Fold it in half down the
middle,” Dad told him.
John folded it and handed it
to Dad. Dad leant forward
and slipped it behind his back.
“Too damn’ hard without
it,” said Dad, leaning back
contentedly.
We moved on down the line,
fixing the wire to the posts.
When we had finished we went
hack and woke Dad.
John pulled the roll of rabbit-
wire from the trailer and put it
between the two fences. He
undid one end and told me
to hang on to it ; then he
started down the line, un-
rolling it as he went.
Dad followed him, and when
they reached the other end Dad
started back to hold my bit
while we got on with the
stapling.
“Look out!” yelled John
when Dad was quarter-way up.
T\AD looked around and saw
the wire. John had let
his end go and it was rolling
itself up.
Dad let out a yell and
started running.
On one side was the olu
fence and on the other the two
barbs of the new one. He
came belting up the straight
between them, the roll springing
along behind. He could run.
By gosh he could run! Steam-
ing down ahead of that roll
like a pro. . . . But the look
on his face as he came nearer —
murder was in his eye.
I dodged out of the way,
forgetting the wire I was
supposed to hold. As soon as
I was off it the end flipped-up
and started rolling towards the
other roll.
Dad saw it and stopped
The rolls bore down on him.
He stood-up straight, swung
round, got boxed as to where
he was, and let out a yell . . .
TOHN and I took-off for a
" distant line of timber.
Looking back over my shoulder
I saw the two rolls meet and
Dad go down.
The wire bounced about.
“I reckon,” said John, look-
ing at the pile with the eye
of an expert, “we’ve about
three minutes to make that
scrub.”

The Debt
By GEORGE CLIVE
IN New Guinea’s humid
heat two Australians
slowly mounted the steps
of an Administration
office ; the elder, stocky, neat
and purposeful, the other a
19-year-old cadet, tall and
gangling.
The old Papuan clerk
hurried to meet them as they
reached the shady veranda.
He held out a letter to the
shorter man.
“Sir, this came in the mail
I have just opened.”
“Thanks, Toti. Hmm, this
is interesting. Do a copy for
Mr. Swire, will you?”
“I have, sir.” Toti rarely
smiled. This time it was smug.
“Oh, have you? Well, come
into my office for a minute,
both of you. Now read it, will
you, Toti?”
Toti made a business of
clearing his throat, then
formally began.
“Heading, sir: Territory of
Papua and New Guinea.
From: the Commissioner of
New Britain. Date: August
twen t y - thi r d. To: Mr.
Assistant District-Officer, J. T.
Sullivan, South Coast Sub-
district, New Britain. Subject:
Mr. P. Swire, Cadet Patrol-
officer.
“ ‘You are advised that, as
from the above date, Mr.
Swire’s cadetship is terminated
and he is appointed patrol-
officer. For your information,
application has been made for
Mr. Swire to be gazetted a
magistrate of the Court of
Native Affairs. The next
“Gazette,” due in three weeks,
will include official notice of
this appointment.’ ”
The clerk handed the copy
over to the elated patrol-
officer. The constable oir
office-duty and the other clerk
had come silently to the door-
way. In his excitement Peter
was trying to shake hands with
Sullivan and with everyone
else in the room, retrieve the
paper, which he kept dropping,
and suppress a war-dance.
“Very good stuff, Peter.
You’ve earned this. As a
minor celebration you can have
that census-patrol of the local
circuit, starting tomorrow.”
“You beaut! I wasn’t due
for promotion for another six
months! ” He was almost
incoherent. “Massive!”
“Go away and start packing
and spread the news. You’re
no good to me in this state!”
After breakfast the follow-
ing day, Sullivan walked with
a still-burbling Peter down the
coral road off the station.
“This shouldn’t be difficult.
Sergeant Ulilio is in charge of
your police. He knows this
circuit. There’s one thing.
Everyone must appear for
census. They were very slack
about that last year, and this
time I’ve given them a week’s
warning, so if anyone doesn’t
turn-up, be tough.”
“What d’you want me to do?
Bring them back here?”
“Oh, no, don’t do that! It’s
all in the book. You’re prac-
tically a magistrate of native
affairs. Try and deal with it
on the spot.”
'T'HE problem cropped-up
continuously, but some-
how the young patrol-officer
found it difficult to be tough.
In the last village of this par-
ticular patrol-circuit, however,
Peter angrily shut the census-
book. He turned to the tall,
slender luluai wearing his red-
banded cap of rank for the
occasion.
“Where the hell is Nusa?” he
demanded.
“Nusa, sir?” The headman
pondered. “Oh, he’s gone to
another village.”
“Why has he gone to another
village? You all knew this was
to be the census-time. Nusa
can live in any village he likes,
but his name’s in this village
book. If he wants to change
it he must come and stand
before me at census-time and
change it.”
“He’s gone because he got
married.”
Peter knew this was a matri-
local area and that Nusa was
only following the custom,
nevertheless . . .
“Well, send for him.” Peter’s
patience snapped. “Eighteen
villages I’ve done in ten days
and always the line’s not com-
plete. Every time one man,
one man is missing. You know
the law of the Government
about census, that I must see
every man, every woman and
every child.”
“Yes, I know, sir,” said the
crestfallen official, “but how
do I know what Nusa thinks?”
Peter growled. This, his first
job as a patrol-officer, was not
going to be spoiled by native
casualness. “Never mind.
Sergeant Ulilio! Find-out
where Nusa is and send a
constable for him. I want him
here before night. I’ve been
too easy in the other villages.
I’m going to make a court.”
The young Australian didn’t
realise what wheels he was
setting in motion. He spent
the afternoon inspecting the
village and its gardens. In the
course of this inspection he
discovered a clear, cool creek.
He’d walked 10 miles or more
that day. The shady pool was
inviting, so he stripped and
plunged in.
He was splashing luxuriously
in the rocky shallows when
Sergeant Ulilio, spruce and
formal, coughed from the
bank.
“Court’s ready, sir,” he
announced.
“What court?”
The cool water had washed
away his irritation and with it
all memory of his command.
The sergeant’s reply, “Sir, the
court you wanted to start about
Nusa,” reminded him.
“Oh, yes.” Peter scrambled
out and started dressing. “You
found him?”
“Yes, sir, his village was not
far.” Ulilio looked a little
severe. “Everything is ready.”
YX7HEN he arrived back at
the village Peter was
astonished to see the complete-
ness of the preparations.
The rest-house, where he was
staying, looked over the
village-square. In front of it
Ulilio had caused a shelter to
be built and thatched. Under
this canopy a few boards,
supported on uprights driven
into the ground, provided a
large table. There was even a
chair, which had once been
a meat-case.
The table was covered with a
new khaki police-laplap. On
it were piled all the books
which Ulilio had been able to
find in the rest-house, mostly
novels. Writing-material was
neatly laid out. There were


bright hibiscus-flowers in an
empty meat-tin.
“Good heavens, sergeant!
I’m not going to hang the
man!”
“True, sir, but I like to do
things properly, as we were
taught, and the number-one
kiap is always in such a
hurry.”
As the young patrol-officer
took his seat, Ulilio called,
“Come here all men who have
talk for this court.”
He was answered immedi-
ately. Nusa, a pleasant-look-
ing man with light-brown skin
and hair faded by peroxide to
gold, was hustled by a
constable to the front of the
table. Behind him stood both
the headman and his deputy
from his new village ; behind
them again the officials of the
village where they were.
On the far edge of the square
a young woman, with baby
astraddle her hip, sobbed
quietly. Peter thought this was
probably Nusa’s wife and
began to feel almost guilty
himself.
Around the square, silent
watchers had flooded into all
the gaps between the houses.
The young patrol-officer
looked at the prisoner.
“Tell me your name,” he
said.
“My name is Nusa.”
“All right, Nusa. What is
your village?”
“Kiap, my true village is this
one, but last year I got married
and went to live in my wife’s
place.”
“Well, Nusa.” Peter with-
drew the Native Affairs Code
from under a couple of lurid
Westerns. “Today when I
called your name you were
not here. The law of the
Government is that when a
kiap comes to count the book,
all men who have heard the
talk must be ready. Do you
know this?”
“Yes, master,” Nusa wriggled
uncomfortably. “I know this.”
“The Government is cross
about this thing, Nusa, and so
you come to court for it. I’m
going to ask you some ques-
tions, but if you don’t like to
talk, it’s all right, you don’t
have to.”
Although Nusa had heard
several native-affairs courts
before, he had never under-
stood this part of the proceed-
ings, but this was obviously
not the time to offend anyone,
so he nodded wisely.
Peter ran through the
smooth and timeworn formulae
of legal proceeding until —■
“Nusa. This court finds you
guilty. I will sleep first and
tomorrow I will tell you what
must happen to you. Court’s
adjourned.”
AS Peter was on the point of
going to bed he heard a
shuffle on the veranda, then a
knock on the door.
“Who’s there?” he called.
“Me. Ulilio.”
“Come in, Ulilio.”
Peter, wearing pyjama-
trousers, fished for cigarettes
and pushed the mosquito-net
back far enough to allow him
to perch on the edge of the
bed.
“Got talk?”
“Yes, sir.” Ulilio was ill-at-
ease. “I have some talk I want
to give you, but I’m afraid
you’ll be angry.”
“Never mind that. Stand
easy and tell me.”
“This man Nusa, sir.”
Ulilio stared down in
embarrassment at one bare
brown foot.
“True, Ulilio. You can’t
talk about Nusa.” Peter knew
himself to be on sure ground
here. “His court isn’t finished.”
Ulilio knew this perfectly
well. That was the trouble. He
wriggled his toes on the black
palm floor.
“Well, sir, may I tell you a
story?”
Peter was tired, but he had
learned from Sullivan never to
neglect any possible source of
information. “All right, Ser-
geant, go ahead.”
“This is a story of when I
was a boy and Japan was here
in New Guinea. The Japanese
brought me from my home in
Morobe to work for them here
in New Britain. My work was
to take the cargo they gave
me and put it on my canoe and
carry it for them up the coast
at night.”
“Why at night?”
“Too many aeroplanes in the
daytime.”
“What was the cargo?”
“Heavy boxes. Food and
ammunition, I think, but I’m
not sure. We of New Guinea
felt great shame at carrying
for Japan, but we had to. We
all had many accidents, some-
times in calm sea, and much
of their cargo went to the
bottom.”
“That sounds dangerous,
Ulilio. What would they have
done if they caught a man
doing this?”
For answer Ulilio half-
turned his back and, with his
right hand on his left shoulder,
indicated the criss-cross welts
that extended from the base
of his neck to his belt. Peter,
who had seen him swimming,
knew that the marks went right
down to the backs of his knees.
“I know, sir, because one
night when there was a big
moon one Japanese saw me
throwing cargo over. They
waited for me to land.”
“Good Lord! I’ve often
seen those marks, but I didn’t
like to ask you what
happened.”
“It was just morning when
they caught me.” Ulilio began
to sweat freely but his voice
continued evenly. “First they
put me in their calaboose.
Then, at midday, they made a
court and called all men who
paddled canoes for them to
watch. In the middle of the
clearing there was a great log
of kwila. They made me lie
down along this and tied my
hands and feet. Then four
Japanese soldiers each beat me
with a long piece of cane, just
ordinary bush -kanda, like your
walking-stick, but not so thick.
They told me that if I didn’t
die today, tomorrow they
would beat me again.”
“At first I didn't cry-out.
Afterwards I don’t remember.
When my eyes opened again it
was night. All my back was
burning and I knew that if
Japan beat me again tomorrow
I would die. I knew too that
all the men around must be
very frightened at what they
had seen. But there was one
man who was my friend. Late
at night he came and cut me
loose and carried me, for I
could not walk, to a hole in the
cliffs. There he kept me hidden
for two months, always giving
me half his food and always
frightened —we were both
frightened—that Japan would
find-out. Then, after I could
walk again, I followed the wild-
pig tracks into the mountains.
I stayed until the Japanese
went away.”
Peter let out a long sigh.
“And the man? Was his name
Nusa?”
“Yes, kiap.” Ulilio dropped
his eyes again. “It was Nusa.”
Peter found himself trem-
bling slightly. The story had
been told with a restraint that
doubled its force and feeling.
“Listen, Ulilio. I have heard
your story and I will not forget.
Now go and sleep.”
"COR the first time in his life,
sleep did not come easily
to Peter. He had heard a story
that moved him profoundly
and that he fancied even Sulli-
van didn’t know. Any man is
entitled to special consideration
for special services, but under
no circumstances must any-
body think that in Nusa’s case
justice was being tempered
because he had friends at
court.
Sitting again at the make-
shift table the next morning,
Peter spoke his mind.
“Nusa. For not coming to
line when the Government calls
a man may be fined five-pounds
or go to jail for one month.
I think you all know that the
number-one kiap does not like
fines, but I am going to be
easy with you. I am going to
fine you two-pounds.
“Now, all men hear. I know
from yesterday, from the
people I asked, that Nusa has
a good record for the time the
Japanese were here. I know,
too, that Sergeant Ulilio is a
friend of his. * I am being easy
with Nusa because of his good
record and because of the
things he did. It makes no
difference to this court if he's
friends with all the policemen
in New Guinea.”
He paused. “Nusa, you
bring me that two-pounds
before I leave today. The
court is finished.”
Nusa broke into a broad
smile of relief. “Thank you
very much, kiap,” he said.
Just before noon the carrier-
line was almost ready to leave.
Peter, who had been talking to
the village officials, found
Ulilio at his elbow, a painfully
embarrassed Ulilio.
“Sir, you know on patrol 1
don’t carry money with me.
But today I find I need some
badly. I’m very sorry to ask,
but could you lend me a little?”
He spoke nervously. “I’ll pay
you back out of my next pay,
but what I need now is . . . er
. . . two pounds.”
“On one condition,” Peter
reached for his wallet. “Never
tell me what you do with it.”
■pETER had been back on the
station for five days
before Toti brought him a
copy of the latest “Gazette,”
one paragraph outlined in red
With this in his hand, Peter
clattered along the veranda
and knocked at Sullivan’s door.
“Morning, John.”
“Good morning, Peter. Ah,
you’ve seen it. Do you feel
any different now you’re
officially a magistrate?”
“No. But John . . .” Peter
came uncertainly towards the
desk. “There’s something I
want to ask you . . . This busi-
ness of holding courts —has it
ever cost you money?”
Sullivan winced. “So they’ve
caught you already?”
He checked Peter with a
raised hand. “It’s all right, but
don’t give me any details.”


A Practical Gesture by an Australian Society—
FRIENDSHIP WITH SOUTH-EAST ASIA
CJTUDENTS at Melbourne University
have begun a campaign against the
White Australia policy and are asking
other Australian universities to join them
in an attempt to influence public opinion
before the next Federal election. They
are reported to consider the policy an
“immoral insult to our Asian friends
and a policy incompatible with our
supposed Christian faith.”
The students have not been very
explicit on their ultimate objective, but
it is assumed that they do not advocate
unrestricted immigration from Asia, but
support the proposal frequently advocated
in recent years by churchmen and
others that Australia should introduce
a quota-system for Asian immigrants.
Advocates of the quota seem to follow
a completely illogical line of reasoning
which goes something like this: Aus-
tralia’s exclusive immigration policy is
offensive to Asians because it seems to
imply a feeling of white racial
superiority. Therefore, if we relax it a
little and admit token-batches of Asians,
we will be proving that we don’t really
think we’re superior, and the Asian
people will realise that we really want to
be friends and brothers and everything
in the Austral-Asian garden will be
lovely.
There’s something cockeyed about all
this. It suggests the very feeling of racial
superiority which its sponsors condemn.
Why should it be assumed that Asians
want to become Australians any more
than Australians want to become Asians?
And if they do, why should the admis-
sion of a small quota each year soothe
the hurt pride of the hundreds of millions
still excluded? If the White Australia
policy is regarded as an immoral insult,
then a quota-system would be worse
still —a studied insult. Even Dr. Evatt,
whom no one could accuse of lack of
friendliness towards Asia, has said on TV
that the institution of a quota for Asian
migrants would be “close to hypocrisy.”
No Racial Superiority
the question of racial superiority,
External Affairs Minister Casey
made some sound comments to the Aus-
tralian Society of Accountants a fort-
night ago at the opening of the society’s
convention in Sydney. He said that his
experiences in Bengal during the war
and in the various countries of South-
east Asia since the war had convinced
him that there was no such thing as an
inherently superior race. In some coun-
tries there were better economic condi-
tions, more opportunities for education
and more opportunities for advance-
ment ; in helping less-fortunate countries
there must never be any feeling of
superiority or of condescension. This is
a frame of mind from which the quota-
advocates seem unable completely to
free themselves.
Mr. Casey spoke of the tendency of
Australians to think of South and South-
east Asia as one place, whereas,
it is twelve countries, each one with its
own background, industry, tradition and
culture, and in many cases having different
languages and religions. They are far
from being a homogeneous whole; they
are twelve separate countries, each conscious
of its autonomy and its independence.
They are very jealous of their independ-
ence, quite understandably, and they are
determined to resent intensely anything that
they may imagine may infinge on their,
sovereignty and their independence.
It had been the aim of the Australian
Government, Mr. Casey said, to estab-
lish confident relationships with these
newly independent peoples ; this was the
task Australian diplomats in the twelve
countries were engaged upon. The
Colombo Plan sought to raise living-
standards in South-east Asian countries
by helping them to help themselves.
Not the least important aspect of this
was “to help them train their people.”
Casey called this “the increasing of the
human capital of the twelve countries”:
Today we have in Australia something
like 6000 Asians in training at schools,
universities, technical colleges, hospitals,
State and Federal departments and in
private firms. Of these 6000 Asians, some-
thing over 800 are here under the Colombo
Plan The Colombo Plan people came
first; in their train came many thousands
of others who paid for their own training
here.... All this is enabling Australians to
get to know the Asians and, in the various
Asian countries, they get to know us.
A Fine Example
"VTR. CASEY then referred to a very
fine example of good-neighbor
policy as practised by the Australian
Society of Accountants, which now con-
ducts examinations in accountancy in
various parts of South-east Asia and
admits to membership qualified students
in those areas.
The society’s entry into that part of
the world was not a planned extension
of its activities in the sense of being
deliberately sought by the society. Nor
is it intended to be permanent. It is
recognised that as time goes on the
various countries will want to establish
their own accountancy institutes. In the
meantime the Australian Society of
Accountants is prepared to fill the gap.
The move began in the post-war years
when requests were received from Asian
students for acceptance as examination
candidates. These increased as the
Colombo Plan developed and in 1955 and
1956 the numbers admitted to the register
were 206 and 260 respectively. As the
numbers grew, something more stable
seemed to be called for and last year
the Federal Government sponsored a
visit to the area by O. H. Paton, president
of the society, and C. W. Andersen,
general-registrar.
Plan in Action
AS a result of this visit, official repre-
sentatives of the society were
appointed in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur
and Hong Kong, and libraries were
established and committees of advice and
students’ societies organised in each of
these three cities. These facilities are
provided by the society from its own
resources. The three local representatives
all have connections with Australia.
Mr. Chang Sow Khong (Kuala
Lumpur) graduated in Commerce at Mel-
bourne University and subsequently
became a member of the Australian
Society of Accountants. He served in
the A.I.F. in World War 11. Mr. F. K. P.
Kwan (Singapore) qualified for mem-
bership of the society while studying in
Australia under the Colombo Plan. Dr.
W. S. Wong (Hong Kong) studied in the
U.S., but his son Baldwin graduated with
distinction in Commerce at the University
of Queensland, joined a Brisbane firm
of public accountants and gained top
places in Australia in the examinations
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in Australia.
At the present time nearly 1000
students in South-east Asia are taking
the society’s examinations. Of these, 475
are in Malaya, 300 in Singapore and 175
in Hong Kong. In addition, 420 Asian
students are studying accountancy in
Australia.
A practical demonstration of friend-
ship of the sort shown by the Australian
Society of Accountants is far more likely
to have lasting beneficial results in
South-east Asia than misdirected advo-
cacy of a quota for Asian migrants. It
fits into the pattern of Colombo Plan
co-operation and friendship which Aus-
tralian representatives in the twelve
countries of the region are doing their
best to cultivate. In recent years Aus-
tralia’s immigration policy with respect
to the people of Asia has been adminis-
tered sanely, humanely and with
commonsense. Many diplomats from
Asian countries have admitted privately
that they quite understand Australian
opinion on the subject and do not resent
it. No Asian countries accept dictation
on the matter of what migrants they
shall admit; many have their own
exclusion lists.
Australian university students, having
worked and played with students from
South-east Asia, have found them in the
main likeable and decent young people
with aspirations and ambitions not greatly
dissimilar from their own. By their
conduct towards these visitors they have
done—and are doing—a great job for
friendly relations between Australia and
its near-neighbors. It will be a great
pity if they undo all this by stirring-up
feelings which experience in other parts
of the world has shown can ruin over-
night the patient work of years.

All three placegetters in the
Rosehill Civic Handicap—
Gold Stakes, New Spec and
Diamond Vista are in the
Q.T.C. Stradbroke Handicap,
and all three drop 51b. on the
weight carried last Saturday,
when Gold Stakes had 8.12,
New Spec 8.13 and Diamond
Vista 8.3. New Spec may get
most benefit from the outing,
his first since finishing fourth in
the Doncaster. In that mile
New Spec had 8.7, so 8.8 in
the Brisbane sprint sounds
attractive. However, trainer
L. J. O’Sullivan also has the
favorite, Gay Port, in that
event with 7.13, and it
seems unlikely that both New
Spec and Gay Port will be
in the Q.T.C. line-up.

Caranna has 9st. in the
£12,315 Brisbane Cup (June 16).
He won the Rosehill mile-and-
a-quarter Lord Mayor’s Cup on
Saturday with 9.4 in 2.31,
equalling the race-record. The
run was impressive enough to
send Caranna to the top line
of Brisbane Cup betting, and
he is now favorite with Book
Link and Macdougal. Caranna’s
next race may be in the £l5OO
w.-f.-a. P. J. O’Shea Stakes (101
furlongs) on Stradbroke day
(June 14). Caranna had his
Rosehill task made easier by
the fast pace set by Teranyan,
who finished a tiring third.
Teranyan has led in races on
previous occasions, when Bill
Cook has won on him taking
the lead at barrier-rise; but
then Cook is a master tactician.
Teranyan should soon pick-up
a middle-distance event.
The Auburn Stakes at Rose-
hill was restricted to
apprentices with a 71b. allow-
ance. Some of these races for
the junior jockeys have been
keenly contested and have
shown the young riders up in a
favorable light. However, the
latest of the series didn't. In
fact it was one of the poorest
all-round exhibitions, with one
or two exceptions, given by the
budding champions! Naroco
should have won hands-down
instead of being defeated half-
a-head. There was a jumble-
up about, a furlong-and-a-half
from the winning-post, one of
the chief sufferers being Mash-
lega. Still, winner Lady Aron
was capably handled by
Brisbane rider R. Wilton, who
won his first race in Sydney.
It was also Lady Aron’s first
win. A four-year-old by
Golden Chance (imp.) from
Figurine, she’s related to
Hadrian, one of the speediest
horses of his years, whose wins
included the Hobartville Stakes
and the C. W. Cropper Plate.
• t • •
Rosehill patrons didn't antici-
pate bookmakers offering
2 to 1 about three horses at
varying stages of the Civic
Handicap, in which there were
13 starters but only four in
the betting. The favored three
duly filled the places, with the
only other wanted, Royal King-
dom, finishing fourth. Honors
of the sprint were with Gold
Stakes, who gave his speedy
opponents a start and a beating.
It must be many years since
three horses figured in betting
as equal-favorites at 2 to 1
about 10 minutes before the
start or at any stage of
wagering.

Slogan II is sliding down
to the minimum weight, which
seems strange for a dual A.J.C.
Doncaster Handicap winner
(1956-57). He was weighted at
7.6, or 51b. above the limit, for
the Rosehill Civic Handicap,
but was last most of the way
and beat three home. That run
was in keeping with all his
recent displays. When weights
were issued for the recent Don-
caster, Slogan was allotted Bst.,
but he beat only a few home.
Even so, though he's now a
six-year-old, there should be
a few more wins from him yet.

Progeny of Newtown
Wonder (imp.) won the open-
ing races at both Moonee
Valley and Rosehill last
Saturday. Both started
favorite. The Melbourne
winner, New Trend, did his
early racing in Sydney. Talker,
winner of the Two-year-old
Handicap, cost 1500gns. as a
yearling at the Randwick sales
last year. His dam, Miss
Chatterbox, is by Talking from
Deep Purple by Marconigram
(imp.). On his Rosehill display
Talker could prove a three-
year-old of marked ability and
might develop into a first-class
stayer; family-lines include
The Fortune Hunter, 1917
Sydney Cup winner and winner
also of the Summer Cup and
Tattersall’s Cup.
The Game Archer stable
picked the right race at Rose-
hill. The gelding was engaged
in both the Welter and the
Second Parramatta Stakes, but
it was decided to take on the
easier event, in which the Stock-
ade (imp.) galloper was
weighted as an Encourage
horse, 9st. He went to the front
in the early part and just
managed to stall-off Lord
Terrance in a head-and-head'
finish.
• • • •
In the Welter Game Archer
had 8.1, or lib. above the
limit, but he would have been
set a tough task to beat Ply-
mouth, who won the Welter
easily. Plymouth is engaged
in the Q.T.C. Stradbroke
Handicap on 7.6. Twenty-one-
year-old Frank Leman rode
the winner. He also won on his
stablemate Medallion at
Warwick Farm three days
earlier, so he has made a good
start as a fully-fledged jockey.
Fourteen years ago at the
inaugural meeting of the
Sydney Turf Club, staged at
Randwick, champion mare
Flight won the first Lord
Mayor’s Cup. She was ridden
by Jack Thompson, who also
won the race the following
season at Canterbury on Alan
Veil. After that year this Cup
was run at Rosehill, and
Thompson again won last
Saturday on Caranna.

all the way—an impressive
run. His dam, Tarien, was
a top winning mare, earn-
ing £17,765 when trained by
Smith. She was first past the

course. The narrow, circular
track does not suit the gait of
all horses, while often enough
gallopers who do well at the
Valley are not of much account
on other tracks. To that hazard
last Saturday was added the
problem of heavy going.
Both these factors were
responsible for the connections
of New Trend getting an unex-
pectedly good price about the
gelding in the first Laluma
Handicap. New Trend was hav-
ing his first start at the Valley,
and he is by Newtown Won-
der, whose stock are not usually
at their best in heavy going.
However, New Trend was
untroubled to win by a great
margin. The youngster did his
early racing in Sydney without
showing much form, but since
coming to Melbourne he has
been a brilliant track-worker,
and Saturday’s run indicates
that few two-year-olds about
at present will match strides
with him over a sprint distance.
Winner of the second divi-
sion of the Laluma, Mirabeau
is lucky to be racing. When
he was being educated to bar-
rier-starting he injured his neck
so badly that thought was
given to destroying him. Time
cured the damage, and this
lightly raced Valognes-Com-
pact colt has proved a good
winter performer. Mirabeau’s
time for the six-furlongs-fess-
20yds., 1.20|, indicates the
state of the track. Comic
Court’s course-record for the
distance is 1.9. Even so, Mira-
beau had six lengths to spare
on the line, and should
w!n more races In similar
conditions.
Stamina of the three-year-
olds in the Empire Handicap
at the Valley was severely
tested by the 13-furlongs jour-
ney in muddy conditions. Most
of them were found wanting,
with two runners, Gazette and
Bambara, having the race to
themselves over the last three
furlongs. These two showed
courage as they went head and
head for all that distance, the
narrow verdict to Gazette.
It is significant that Comic
Court sired both Gazette and
Bambara. The former cham-
pion’s stock have not done
much good as two-year-olds,
but it is apparent that he has
passed on his own qualities of
stamina and will-to-win. Gaz-
ette is out of Roma and was
bred by his owner, former
V.R.C. committeeman R. J.
Watson. Bambara is from
Surma, and is raced by
V.R.C. vice-chairman E. A.
Underwood.
In the Melrose Steeple at the
Valley, Van Perri attempted a
most unusual feat. Winner of
the Melrose three years in a
row, the nine-year-old gelding
tried to make the sequence
four. His 12.2 was too heavy a
burden on the rain-soaked
track, and he finished well
down the running. The race
went to Roadbourne, noted
here a couple of weeks ago as
a fencer of promise.
From four Steeple starts the
aged Ford Transport gelding
has won three times. The
sloppy going made the take-off
for all jumps a precarious busi-
ness, and Roadbourne all but
came down a couple of times.
Jockey Alec Moon earned the
applause of the crowd by his
cleverness in retaining his seat
after these bad jumps. The
comment made here after
Roadbourne’s previous win is
repeated—the aged gelding
does not impress as likely to
have enough stamina to run the
National journey.
With the important winter
racing in Brisbane in mind, best
performance staged at the
Valley was White Hills’s win in
the mile Deep Creek Handicap.
White Hills trounced a
reasonably good-class field, and
ensured himself a start in the
Doomben Cup. A four-year-
old chestnut gelding, White
Hills has shown promise
throughout his career, and
would not surprise if he proved
right up to the company he will
meet in Brisbane. He is by the
Hyperion horse High Peak
from Fiorenzo—thus a full-
brother to Kosciusko by
Dhoti from Italicise. It is a
family which includes dual
Moonee Valley Cup winner
Valcurl. White Hills was
ridden by inexperienced lad
Alex Novak, who had not
previously ridden a city winner.
A disappointing favorite in
the Deep Creek Handicap was
Timor. In assessing last year’s
Epsom winner’s chances in
Brisbane, however, it should be
remembered that Timor is
hopeless on a heavy track. His
failure on Saturday will not
alter plans to take him north.
Of more importance will be the
race chosen in Brisbane for
Timor. He has 8.11 in the
seven-furlongs Stradbroke and
8.6 in the Brisbane Cup.
According to trainer Arma-
nasco, the Cup is his mission.
In this writer’s view Timor
will find the two miles of the
Cup more than he can manage.
Connections of Firth, winner
of the Kiata Handicap, the
last race at the Valley, must
have cast anxious eyes at the
scratching-board early in the
day. Conditions at the track
were ideal for Firth, who
improves 2st. in the wet, but
the mare was only third
emergency for the sprint. How-
ever, four accepted horses came
out, and connections of Firth
put in for a big win on the
mare. She gave them no cause
for worry, winning by any
number of lengths. Just what
difference the conditions inade
to her is shown by the fact that
she had been beaten in weak
country events at her two
previous starts.
* * *
“P.0.M.C.”: Horses nowa-
days rarely win two races on
the one afternoon on city
tracks (B. 7/5/’5B) mainly
because they’re seldom given
the chance. Old-timers like
Bill Booth, Bob Baillie, George
Price and the Donohoes often
saddled-up favorably handi-
capped horses twice on the same
day. Vaals won a sprint and a
welter handicap inside two
hours at Rosehill a week before
winning the 1927 Epsom, and
six years ago Prelate (running,
like Gregory John on 3/5/’5B,
for the Donohoes) won two
races on the same day during
a sequence of six or seven vic-
tories before winning the 1952
Doncaster. A year earlier,
Aqua Regis won sprint and
middle-distance events on the
same afternoon at Randwick
and then went to Brisbane to
win the Stradbroke Handicap.

Trotting
Before a crowd of 18,500 at
Harold Park on Saturday night,
champion pacing mare Perfect
Lass comfortably won the
feature race, the £lOOO Oaks
for three-year-old fillies. Start-
ing at 7-to-4 on, she beat
2-to-l Smoko (winner of last
month’s Victoria Derby) by a
clear length, with Silvena (20
to 1) three lengths further away
in third place.
It was a two-horse race from
the start. Smoko jumped away
smartly, with Perfect Lass
trailing her. The two singled
out from the rest of the field
and continued in that order
until the turn into the straight,
where Perfect Lass had moved
up within a neck of Smoko.
From there on Perfect Lass
gradually drew ahead.
• • m
This completed the double
for Perfect Lass, who the
previous week defeated the colts
in the N.S.W. Derby. She now
becomes the second filly to win
the rich Derby-Oaks double;
Victorian filly Argent won
both races two years ago. This
completes four wins in a row
for Perfect Lass. Trainer-driver
Sid Boulden said the filly would
now be turned out for a well-
earned spell.
N.Z. trotter Sonatol, who last
year broke down after several
erratic displays at Harold Park,
gave N.Z. reinsman W. Wili-
mott his first winning drive at
the Park. Sonatol (5 to 1)
took the lead in the second lap
and continued to increase it,
beating 4-to-l second-favorite
Jenny by three lengths, with
Single Raider (33 to 1) third.
Favorite Lucky Vale was fifth
throughout.
Running sixth for two laps,
and moving into fourth place
at the “bell,” Malniri finished
brilliantly to win the Harold
Park Handicap by a length

New world-record, if granted,
for the mile, 3.57.8 (beating
Landy’s 3.58, made in Finland
on June 21, 1954), was set by
20-year-old Westralian Herb
Elliott in a race billed for
months ahead as a “miracle
mile,” at the Los Angeles
Coliseum. Every still-running
“four - minute miler” was
invited to compete, but only
three—Elliott, Victorian Merv
Lincoln and former Hungarian
Laszlo Tabori —did so ; and
they filled the places in that
order. Elliott has beaten Lin-
coln every time they have met in
the past couple of years over
both mile and 880yds., and
clearly is the greater runner ;
but Lincoln has good claims
to be considered the world’s
No. 3 miler. A rival with
Elliott for highest honor would
be Britain’s Derek Ibbotson,
who in London on July 19
last year ran 3.57.2, which
time was disallowed as a world-
record because it was paced.
It was suggested that Elliott,
too, was “paced” unknow-
ingly. For Australia to have
two of the three greatest mile-
runners of today (besides hav-
ing produced Landy) is remark-
able enough.

At Salisbury (Rhodesia)
South African “Smiling”
Johnny Van Rensburg beat
Australian George Barnes on
points over 15 rounds to take
the British Empire welter title.
Barnes fought well, and many
thought he earned the decision.
By one of those anomalies
which are always cropping-up
in Australian boxing no less
than in overseas stoush, Barnes
was Empire champion but not
Australian champion —though
he had been national - title-
holder before being beaten by
Darby Brown. (Billy Todd is
present national champion.)

For the second successive
week St. Kilda won its game
by a single point, this time
toppling the mighty Demons,
12.7-11.12, in a hard, slogging
game. Melbourne, in its two
previous games, had had bad
frights from Hawthorn and
Essendon, and, though still
strong, is clearly not invulner-
able. Fitzroy, in defeating
Carlton 8.11-4.16 in a dull
game, again hit the top of the
ladder, which position it occu-
pied for the first two rounds.
Collingwood, now in second
place, had a good 13.17-8.8
win over Richmond down at
Punt Road. The Tigers were
thus kicked out of “the four,”
to be replaced by Hawthorn,
which defeated South
11.15- The other two
games were “upsets.” North
beat Essendon 9.10-7.13 —the
Shinboners, incidentally,
though this was only their
second win, have been surpris-
ingly accurate in their kicking,
and in the six games have
kicked more goals (47) than
behinds (42). Geelong, which
had given Richmond a tussle
the previous week, won its first
game in P 958, up at Footscray,
10.15- “The four,” with
St. Kilda and Richmond, seem
to be the only ones really in
it now.
“Essenwood”: Geelong s
score of 6.6 against Melbourne’s
17.8 at Geelong in the second
round of the V.F.L. was the
Cats’ poorest score against Mel-
bourne since their 4.16 on the
M.C.G. in 1928. It was their
worst at home against Mel-
bourne since 1915. The
Demons’ 68-point winning-
margin was their third-best
against Geelong since the
formation of the League in
1897, their best being 79 points
in 1909.

“Frangeo”: It seems a shame
that professional golfer Ossie
Pickworth has to wait five years
before he is reinstated as an
amateur. It takes three years

to become a pro., yet in

himself good enough he can
“turn” overnight. Time is also
short when Yankee pro. golfers
wish to return to the amateur
ranks—only one year.

has now defeated Australia 5-2,
8-2 and 4-2, but the third time
proved far the hardest for it.
Earlier, under floodlights on the
night of May 13, Blackpool had

-out, though, that at least
half of the stars of City I

are country boys, and if
Country could call on anyone
born in the country, whoever

without doubt Country would

Biography of Banjo Paterson ?
Andrew Barton Paterson was
born near Molong, in N.S.W., on
February 17, 1864. Educated at
Sydney Grammar School, he trained
for the law; he early found time
to combine with his legal work
the writing of cheerful verse,
inspired by the life of the hill-
stations where he spent his holidays.
His pen-name “Banjo” became
familiar to Bulletin readers in
the early ’nineties; in 1895 his first
volume of verse — The Man from
Snowy River —scored a resound-
ing success. War-correspondent for
“But I cant afford a hundred-quid a day for counsel.
It'd chew-up all me profits !”
} the “Sydney Morning Herald” in
the South African War; saw some
of the Boxer War in China; then
became for two years editor of the
Sydney “Evening News,” later
spending two years in the editorial
chair of the “Town and Country
Journal.” In 1906 he published
An Outback Marriage, a collec-
tion of bush incidents.
In World War 1 he was com-
missioned lieutenant in the remount
service and attached to the
Egyptian depot of the Australian
Imperial Forces, returning to Aus-
tralia at war’s end with the rank
of major.
Paterson’s bush is the home of
the optimist—usually a horseman or
drover who takes his troubles in
his stride. His literary value as
an interpreter of Australia is equal
to the best of Australian writers.
His other publications include
Rio Grande’s Last Race and Other
Verses (Sydney, 1902), Salt Bush
Bill, J.P., and Other Verses
(Sydney, 1917), and Three Elephant
Power and Other Stories (Sydney,
1905). A collected edition of his
verses was published in 1921.
What were the circumstances
surrounding Dr. Rudolf Diesel’s
death ?
Dr. Rudolf Diesel, inventor of the
diesel-engine, was showered with
honors by the Kaiser for his inven-
tion ; but, though he had also made
a fortune from it, he was reported
to be getting into financial diffi-
culties (as was later proved). He
therefore negotiated with the
British Admiralty, and sailed on
an overnight steamer from Antwerp
for England in Sept., 1913, During
the night he disappeared, and was
never seen again. The (British)
coroner’s verdict was suicide. At
his death it was found that Diesel
was in fact on the verge of bank-
ruptcy, which gives much weight
to the suicide theory. It has also
been suggested that he was killed
by German secret-service agents
because “he knew too much.”

Could you give me some points
on the keeping of bees ?
(The following is from “Bee
Care,” a “Man on the Land”
article by “Drone B.” in B.
1 /2/’56): “Bees need plenty of water
and shade in hot weather; apart
from any question of comfort to
the bees, overheating grossly impairs
the efficiency of the hive. Many
more bees are kept busy ventilating
and cooling the hive, and, being
diverted from more gainful activi-
ties, this army of fanners constricts
the traffic-routes into and out of
the hive. Time per trip is increased,
amount of nectar collected drops.
“Make sure a suitable site is
selected for the apiary, one which
will afford moderate shade to the
colonies during the heat of the
day. Where the site is in open
country and the bees are not
inclined to rob, tilting the covers
and/or staggering the supers a little
to allow the escape of hot air will
often save a good deal of over-
heating.
“Bees use water for three pur-
poses—drinking, cooling and dilu-
tion of honey for brood-feeding—
so it’s important that water-
supplies are near at hand. If it
isn't possible to locate the apiary
close to a natural water-supply, pro-
vide water in drums: a 44-gallon
drum, cut in half longitudinally,
makes two good water-troughs for
the apiarist’s workers. Remember
to put in a number of wooden
floats, otherwise you’ll have a lot
of drowned bees.”

How would I set about taking-
out a patent for an attachment to
a product already on the market ?
Although patent law is not par-
ticularly involved, the procedure of
taking-out a patent is rather tricky:
a false step in one of the various
searches may quite easily result
not only in no patent but also in
an infringement of a patent belong-
ing to someone else. Consult a
reputable patent-attorney.

states that the Great Eastern was
broken-up on Tranmere Beach, in
the Mersey, in 1888, and that there
is no mention in Liverpool news-

N.S.D.: No R.M.: Whether 40
per cent, is a proper return for
the use of a patent depends on the
cost of manufacture and distribu-
tion of the original against the
price which may be obtained for
it and allowing for a reasonable
return to the manufacturer. Exactly
how much is a reasonable return
to the owner of the invention will
differ for each invention. The
inventor may protect himself by
providing in his agreement with the
manufacturer for inspection of the
manufacturer’s books in relation to
the article by the inventor or his
representatives at regular intervals.
It would be a good idea for your
solicitor to draw-up an agreement.
J.T.B.: If you mean relative
humidity, this can be computed by
means of published tables from
readings of the wet- and dry-bulb
thermometers. Alternatively, some
.nstruments are made using ele-
ments (bundles of hair or tieated
spiral springs) which change dimen-
sions with the amount of moisture
in the air. After calibration, these
give direct readings of . relative
humidity fairly accurately

R.V.L.: Room here for one
engaging oddity:
Who l be?
Happy am I.
Laugh and sing merrily.
A water sprite am I.
But most extraordinary of all
At the bottom I live,
Of an old and decrepit waterfall.
There’s but one thing that worries I,
AVhat if the thing runs dry ?
1.8.G.: We’ll have a sip of the
Daly River with you:
I left the town, I spurned renown,
To dwell beside the River.
It isn’t much for fame and such
But better for the liver.
I dine upon the demon rum,
The overproof for choice,
And seldom hear the dreary hum
Of any human voice.
My hut is built of paper-bark,
The floor is merely mud,
And every evening after dark
Mosquitoes drink my blood.
I sometimes put on shirt and pants—>
I don’t wear them for fun ;
They shelter me from jungle-ants,
And also from the sun.
I’ve spots upon my legs and arms,
I itch with prickly heat,
And as I lie beneath the palms,
Goannas bite my feet.
In spite of sneers, in spite of jeers,
I’ve given up the City,
The hardest work I’ve done for years
Is write this little ditty.

tated to you by a ghost we’ll have

stances are interesting: “I cannot
write poetry. Coming in on the
train these lines came to me from
my old pal, the son of a former
Melbourne resident and an hotel-
keeper, killed on Gallipoli. Ever
since the first Anzac march he
has spoken to me regularly every
year through a spiritualist-medium,
pleading with me to do all possible
to have a brighter Anzac Day in
this State —hence his reminder to
me in the form of the poem he
communicated to me in the train.”

SUEZ CANAL COMPENSATION
■pRESS-comment on the draft-
-*■ agreement between the
Suez Canal Company and the
Egyptian Government adds-up
to a resigned “let’s make the
best of it.”:
Manchester “ Guardian ”:
“For the old Suez Canal Com-
pany the agreement it has
reached with the United Arab
Republic brings to an end a
long and difficult battle of wits.
The Government of the United
Arab Republic, on the other
hand, may look upon it as a
beginning—the first stage in
having its dollar and sterling
assets unfrozen, in getting on
friendlier terms with America,
and in resuming diplomatic
relations with Britain. (France
is a harder case ; there are com-
plications like Algeria.) In this
way it may hope to reduce its
economic and diplomatic—
perhaps also its military—de-
pendence on the Soviet Union.
That is what President Nasser
is said to be anxious to do, in
spite of his present sojourn in
Moscow.”
The same : “Like astute bar-
gainers in the markets of their
country, the Egyptians, in all
the sets of negotiations in
which they have been engaged,
have shown no haste; nor
need we [the West]. The
Americans, in particular, have
so much more to offer to
President Nasser than he to
them that they can afford to be
forthcoming or coy just as his
attitude warrants. But if they
are right in their assessment of
his motives —if he really does
believe that his aim of getting
the most he can from both
sides is being endangered by
the engulfing power of, the-
Soviet Union—then the bargain
is one which both parties want
to conclude.
“Here, for once, our
[Britain’s] interests and the
Egyptians’ coincide. There are
all too many areas in which
they conflict, but we shall be
better able to cope with these
problems when the Egyptians
are spending their pounds in
our factories and markets,
when there is a British
Ambassador in Cairo, and
when the United Arab Re-
public has opened its first
embassy in London.”
London “Economist” :
“Agreement between the Suez
Canal Company and the
Egyptian Government over the
amount of compensation to be
paid to the shareholders is
welcome as the first positive
sign of the return to normal
relations between Egypt and
the West. It has been a long
haggle over £29 million. The
terms now accepted are prob-
ably very little different from
what might have been fixed six
months or so ago, but at that
stage the Western Powers,
habituated to cold-shouldering
President Nasser, showed no
determination to get the nego-
tiators to come to terms. Now
it has come home, to Mr.
Dulles at least, that this policy
was doing no Discreet
heat was turned on both sides,
and a bargain struck.
“The next step for the British
Government is to reach agree-
ment with the Egyptians over
the sequestered and national-
ised British property and to
release Egypt’s frozen sterling
balances. The financial talks
in Rome have drifted on in as
long and as useless'a way as
the wrangles over compensa-
tion. As long ago as January
the two sides had substantially
agreed on what should be done
—but the signatures are still
missing. The British side has
been anxious to guard against
a possible future Egyptian
demand for compensation for
the damage done on Egyptian
soil by the British and French
armies. But the Egyptians may
prefer to keep this card qp
their sleeve.”
* * *
Edinburgh “ Scotsman ”:
“Whatever one may think of
the equity of the compensation
terms and Egypt’s nego-
tiators have not expressed
themselves as ‘delighted’ with
them without good cause—the
main significance of the agree-
ment is political rather than
financial. It implies full recog-
nition of Egypt’s possession of
the canal and opens the way
for the resumption of full
trade and diplomatic relations
between Egypt and the West. *
It is not without significance
that the announcement of the
London “Daily Mail"
BAKSHEESH.
agreement coincides with
Nasser’s visit to Russia. The
path to agreement on the canal
has undoubtedly been smoothed
by the fact that it is the
prerequisite of his acquiring
credits from America and the
West. The price of Suez has
been high, but the price of a
Communist-dominated Egypt
astride the canal and the oil-
lines would be higher.”
* * *
“Yorkshire Post”: “The
draft settlement is not an inspir-
ing thing, although the West
must give it a welcome. The
sum of about £29 million
which Egypt is to pay in com-
pensation to the shareholders
is rather larger than might have
been expected, and, in spite of
the critical feeling reported
from France, most people will
be relieved that the months of
protracted negotiations are
now over. It is doubtful if
any better agreement could
have been reached by merely
prolonging the argument.
“With this agreement Egypt’s
nationalisation of the canal
has been given a final stamp of
respectability. It is a fact
which can give few in this
country much pleasure. And
when it is read in conjunction
with an announcement from
United States Treasury
Department the general mood
of those who remembered the
crisis of 1956 must be one of
apprehension and regret. The
Treasury Department com-
firmed that it had unfrozen
about £ 10-million-worth of
Egyptian assets which had been
blocked. Perhaps only
President Nasser and his sup-
porters could rejoice at that,
“In Russia, he [Nasser] was
greeted as a guest-of-honor, the
Moscow guards playing the
Egyptian national anthem for
his benefit, and Mr. Khrush-
chev and President Voroshilov
driving through the streets with
him in an open car. If the
United States Treasury had
had a beter sense of timing it
might have delayed its
announcement until President
Nasser returns to Cairo.
“The picture left in the
public mind is one of the
United States and the Soviet
Union competing for President
Nasser’s friendship, as though,
while he is being wooed in
Moscow, nothing is more
important than to assure him

Faith in the
Future
L
The urgency of Australia’s road problem
comes up to face us in so many ways.
Figures have been published recently to show
that there are now twice the number of registered
motor vehicles in this country than there were in
1948. In other words, the traffic density has doubled
in ten years.
That, we may say, is a sign of progress. It is;
but what of the roads that must accompany this
activity in the making of a transport system
on which our developmental success most
surely depends?
Authorities in traffic engineering tell us that
by 1975, on present trends in population and eco-
nomic growth, there should be five million vehicles
on our roads. That is more than double the
number today.
And lest we imagine that 1975 is a long
way off, it can be placed in the future exactly
where 1941 lies in the past —a mere minute in
national time.
Even on our present density of traffic, the costs
of freight in this country are being pressed up by
congestion, delays, wear on vehicles, high insurance
premiums, and other factors that can be traced
directly to the inadequacy of roads.
But the drain does not end there, in material
charges to be passed along for somebody, or every-
body, to pay: it extends into human suffering. The
annual economic loss of Australian road accidents
alone has been placed at upwards of £25-million,
or two-thirds of the £37-million the Federal Govern-
ment is granting to the States for road works this
year. In that tragic bill, if nowhere else, is the
answer to whether we can “afford” better, wider,
and safer highways.
Of course, so very much else remains to be
done in building to the future; but in all faith we
have to act upon the certainty that roads are of a
first importance—and the longer we delay in build-
ing them long and wide and deep into the continent,
the greater the cost is going to be in Australian
life and living.
////asf^f s
that the West will let bygones
be bygones. It is hard to
believe that the United States
is really so blind to the faults
of an attitude which yielded
such ill-results in the past.”
Summit Talks
Were it not for H-bombs
and intercontinental missiles
there would be a delightful note
of humor in London “Daily
Telegraph’s” editorial comment
that the barrage of Notes and
letters about a summit con-
ference [for a better under-
standing between the Powers]
are “increasing tension and
endangering world peace”:
“The danger of war today is
not that one Power or another
will purposefully launch an
attack. It is that owing to a
breakdown in mutual under-
standing some Power will
gravely miscalculate the inten-
tions of its rival, and that war
will break-out through error.
The real danger, in short, is
not that disagreement should
exist, but that the areas of
disagreement should become
blurred and imprecise. Peace,
therefore, is served by any
procedures that clarify basic
attitudes; and endangered by
procedures that obscure them.
“Yet during the past few
months the Great Powers have
been indulging in exchanges
which have left Governments
and peoples deeply confused
about what the other side seeks
and desires. Not at any period
since the imntediate post-war
period, when the hot-war
alliance was breaking-up and
the cold-war alliances were not
yet formed, has East and West
understood so little about each
other. The West is baffled and
suspicious. It finds increasing
difficulty in interpreting the
motives of the Russians. This
is a far more alarming condi-
tion than that of clear-cut
hostility over precise issues and
interests. And with each new
summit step, either sideways,
upwards or downwards, mutual
incomprehension deepens.
“The summit talks may fail
—indeed they must prove either
nebulous or a failure without
the preparation on which the
West insists. But the exact
formulas of preparation are less
important than seeing whether
preparation can get somewhere
by any formula not manifestly
ridiculous.”
U.K. Defence
Reorganisation
While various camps are
fighting in the U.S. over
President Eisenhower’s pro-
posals for a unified command
of American Services, the U.K.
is also going quietly ahead
towards changes in its own
defence set-up.
The need for these is dictated
not only by economy and
domestic pressures. Looking at
East-West tensions, London
“Time and Tide” comments
that “if there is no summit
conference, or if one takes
place and patently fails, the
need for realistic defence
measures will be increased
rather than diminished: but,
if a summit conference does
take place, followed for a while
by an atmosphere of apparent
goodwill, there would inevitably
be repercussions on Western
defence planners, already find-
ing things difficult enough”:
“At the moment, as a result,
of the latest Nato decisions, the
ground forces in Europe are
being increased. They now
amount to some 22 divisions
and others should be added
soon. Plans to have more
nuclear weapons ready for
action are also being pushed
ahead. This increased emphasis
on the ‘ground shield’ is
obviously looking forward to a
reduction and perhaps the
abolition of the major ‘deter-
rent.’ The decision to reduce
British forces to 45,000 men
by 1960 still stands and so does
[Defence Minister] Sandys's
wish to reduce even further,
stopping only at the limit
below which Britain could no
longer claim the commands she
now holds.
“It is hard to see how that
decision could be maintained,
let alone carried further, if a
summit conference really pro-
duced an agreement to abandon
nuclear weapons and their
manufacture: and such an
agreement is still the declared
aim of all Governments, how-
ever unlikely its attainment may
be. If the ‘deterrent’ (that is,
the long-range nuclear missile)
were to be abolished and only
tactical atomic weapons left in
our armories, the importance
of the conventional bomber
would be enormously increased
and a complete readjustment of
defence-policy might be needed
before the allied forces could
be restored to a position from
which they could ward - off

enemy attacks or themselves
mount the old type of offensive.
“It is, of course, true that
no such abolition could be
accepted by the West unless
there were a prior agreement
for a drastic reduction in con-
ventional armaments in such
a way that the West would be
left relatively as capable of
defending herself as she was
when she possessed the nuclear
‘deterrent.’ No one has yet
succeeded in explaining what
such an agreement would be
like and any suggestion satis-
factory to the West would be
almost certainly rejected by the
Russians.
“For the time being, any-
way, defence policy is based
on the ‘deterrent’ and the
equipping of Western forces
with nuclear weapons. The
Nato conference, which Mr.
Sandys certainly dominated at
the political level, also recom-
mended new efforts towards
standardisation and co-opera-
tion in the manufacture of
equipment as the best way of
ensuring both efficiency and
economy. The soldiers quite
rightly ignored the complex
possibilities which might come
out of a summit conference.
Until new agreements are
actually made, this country
[Britain] and the other members
of the Western Alliance must
firmly refuse to be distracted
either by optimists or pessimists
but must concentrate simply on
maintaining and increasing such
deterrent power as may be
•available to them. This is
neither ; war-mongering nor
politics: it is plain common-
*sense.
“With this in mind, Mr.
Sandys is pursuing his cam-
paign to centralise all military
planning in the Ministry of
Defence. He does not mean to
create one service out of three
or to make separate administra-
tions redundant. He intends
merely to save time and money
and to prevent the inevitable
friction, now increased by the
fact that adjudication between
the services concerns the entire
Cabinet and is affected by many
considerations other than those
of defence. If Mr. Sandys has
his way the Ministry of
Defence will control both
finance and planning; it will
be in a position roughly
equivalent to that of Mr.
Churchill’s war-time Chiefs-of-
Staff Committee. The three
service Ministers will become
its agents without altogether
losing their independence in
internal affairs.
“This campaign has still to be
won and its result no doubt
depends on the continuance of
the present political situation.
Certainly the need for an
overruling authority seems
insistent, especially in view of
Britain’s overseas commitments
—commitments whose import-
ance must be estimated not in
the light of past situations but
of the world situation as it is
today: and, if a summit con-
ference actually succeeded in
arriving at practical decisions
on disarmament, the need for
a new defence structure might
be even greater, might indeed
be so urgent that opposition
would largely fade away.”
Trade with Russia
Commenting on the
American recession—and on
U.S. and British concern over
Russia’s growing industrial
machine “Yorkshire Post”
N.Y. “Herald Tribune ”
“WHATCHA WAITIN’ FOR DOWN THERE?"
repeats its previously expressed
opinion that Mr. Khrushchev
may possibly try to deepen this
recession into a world slump,
with the object of bringing
economic and political chaos
into the democratic camp.
Even without this specific aim,
the paper adds, the growing
industrial and economic
strength of Russia is a direct
threat to Western standards of
living Mr. Khrushchev’s
challenge to an economic
contest in place of a military
one was not made idly.
“Yet,” the “Yorkshire Post,”
continues, it is “precisely in
our economic relations with
the Soviet bloc that the
Western nations face serious
handicaps”:
“The ‘embargo-list’ on goods
for export to that bloc has
had harmful effects on our
own trade outlook. It includes,
for instance, diesels, electric
generators, rolling-mills and
machine-tools, which Russia,
barred from buying them from
us, has instead made for herself
—and is now exporting to
markets where we might have
been selling them. Because of
the controls imposed on
materials in the strategic list,
we have lost not only Soviet
customers but others into the
bad bargain.
“Britain’s trade with Russia,
while small in comparison with
our total foreign trade, is by
no means negligible, and is
of even more significance in
the present days and months of
international trade uncertainty
and shrinking markets. It has
risen from £52,200,000 in
1953 to £122,500,000 last year
—or more than doubled. That
is still more striking if we con-
sider that Britain’s exports to
Russia in the same period,
despite the strategic controls,
have been multiplied not by
two but by 10 and more.
“Ships are being laid-up in
north-east British ports for lack
of cargoes, and north-east ship-
yards, after years of boom, are
finding their order - books
shortening. Yet Russia remains
almost insatiable for ships,
which in the past five years
came fourth in our exports to
her, and but for the strategic
controls could well have come
higher. Iron and steel, mostly
in thin steel sheets, came fifth
—and thin steel sheets are
becoming difficult to sell in the
world. Sales of copper wire,
machinery and electrical
apparatus, the three largest
items of exports to Russia, have
declined because of the
strategic controls.
“It is not surprising that in
the present economic situation
Sir Greville Maginness, the
president of the Russo-British
Chamber of Commerce, has
urged on the President of the
Board of Trade the view of
the British members of the
chamber that the embargo-fist
should be abolished, and has
asked the British Government
to pass that view on to the
Tariff Co-ordinating Com-
mittee. Straightforward mili-
tary items, he has pointed-out,
can easily be dealt with by the
existing licensing system.
“In his presidential address
to the annual meeting of the
Russo-British Chamber of
Commerce he pointed-out that
the Russians like to order not
merely parts of the equipment
for a plant, but the whole plant
from top to bottom.
“Last summer they placed a
£7,500,000 order in Britain for
a complete rubber-tyre factory
for the Ukraine, while other

The German Economy
Fresh bursts of admiring
comment on Germany s
flourishing economy were
prompted by the visit of
German Economics Minister
Erhard to America, and,
comments a London “Financial
Times” writer, Erhard himself
is in the enviable position of
knowing that his country is the
least likely to be affected by the
American recession, and can
therefore negotiate on the Free
Trade Area, or tariffs or E.P.U.
without any qualm.
Erhard bases his optimism
on the forecasts of his statistical
department, which is the only
one in Europe to produce
monthly figures both on in-
dustrial production and on
orders received. Some 12,000
German firms are bound by
law' to report in absolute
figures—not percentages —at the
start of each month the value
of orders booked in the
previous month. This “measur-
ing device” shows changes in
business-trends about three
months earlier than in other
European countries.
These order-book statistics,
the “F.T.” writer comments,
show that in Germany, too, the
boom is over, but that the
slackening in activity is not
steep since it rests on a great
volume of investment in most
of the large German industries:
“Whereas gross fixed invest-
ments declined in most
countries last year, they kept
on rising in Germany by about
2000-million marks to a sum
total of 49,000-million marks.
Last year 23.6 per cent, of the
gross national production was
reinvested.”
Order-book statistics early
this year show the curve still
pointing upwards and home-
market orders in capital goods
in February were up by 11 per
cent, on that time last year.
Thus the slack in export orders
may be taken-up.
The “F.T.” writer adds that
German corporations can raise
funds at 7.7 j per cent, now, as
compared with 9.9% per cent,
two years ago. In Germany
money started to become
cheaper last summer when the
U.S. still maintained the neces-
sity for credit-stringency.
Not every businessman would
agree with Erhard’s confidence,
comments the “F.T.” writer:
“With an industrial export-
ratio of 25 per cent., Germany
is bound to be affected by a
depression in other countries.
“The truth lies probably in
the middle. Steel-output is now
down to last year's level but
has not fallen below it. The
plight of the coal industry is
genuine but could be remedied
by Governmental action. Out-
put of machine-tools is 16 per
cent, below last year’s rate, yam
by 11 per cent., building-
machinery by 8 per cent, and
caustic-soda by nearly 7 per
cent.; but fuel-oil is up by 75
per cent., television-sets by 54
per cent., cars by 30 per cent.,
equipment for steel mills by 30
per cent, and textile-machinery
by 15 per cent.”
The crux of the matter, then,
is that, should Minister Erhard
“ever be forced to admit that
the dangerous phase of depres-
sion feeding on depression was
at hand,” he would have a
number of stimulants to call on
both in home- and export-
markets. Railways, road-build-
ing, housing-schemes and
defence all form a sort of
“inflatable boom cushion.”
Germany would also restore
export-aids which it cut when
export-surpluses soared.
Germany’s vast accumulated
reserves of foreign currency
will effectively stave-off any
balance-of-payment difficulties,
while the healthier state of the
capital-market in Germany has
allowed her to make a start at
long-term credits to foreign
countries by granting a loan to
Iceland —£70,000 on generous
terms: 20 years at 4 per cent,
interest. The leader in this
London “Daily Mirror"
“WHAT, GIVE IT UP LIKE YOU? JUST WHEN WE’RE
TRYING SOME TOBACCO THAT WON’T DO
ANY HARM?"
loan was the state-controlled
Reconstruction Bank.
The “F.T.” writer adds
that “the financial possibilities
of Germany have grown
tremendously over the last few
years”:
“She could easily invest in
overseas countries —as distinct
from merely selling. She could
play a large part in aiding
newly developing countries.
Undoubtedly prospects for her
doing so will be discussed in
London—at least tentatively.”
Germans admit that Marshall
Aid and the slow start of re-
armament were windfalls, but
deny that they owe their success
to these factors alone. They
maintain that the true reason
for this success was that the
productivity of labor rose at
least as fast as wages. As long
as this trend continues, Erhard
believes that the strength of
German industry will continue
and so a recession in Germany
would be less severe than else-
where.
“The only two dangers he
(Erhard) sees for German
economy at the moment are
cuts in working-time affecting
production per worker and
industrialists preferring smaller
output to a reduction of prices.”
Japan's Trade
Japan’s urgent need for trade
—highlighted once again by
Nationalist China’s concern
over the so-called private trade-
agreement between Japan and
Red China —is, comments New
York “Herald Tribune,” “an
acute problem”:
“Adlai Stevenson stated the
case succinctly at the National
Conference of Organisations
on International Trade Policy:
‘With too many people, too
little land, too few resources,
Japan must import about one-
fourth of her food and nearly
all the cotton, wool, iron-ore
and other materials she pro-
cesses. She can pay for them
only with exports. Trade is
life or death for Japan.’ ”
To which comment the
“Herald Tribune” adds the
suggestion that, “if the free
world would mobilise its eco-
nomic resources on the basis of
enlightened, genuinely
reciprocal trade, it could at
the same time build-up areas
of economic good health,
resistant to Communist infec-
tion, and reduce the dangerous
temptations to trade with the
Communist bloc under the
pressure of sheer necessity.
The United States should lead
such a movement, not as a
crusade but as a measure of
downright good sense.”
Alan Lennox-Boyd ( Britain's
Colonial Secretary): “If you
hear it argued that the fchoice
is between the Kremlin and the
crematorium, I beg you to
believe that, if we choose the
Kremlin, we would have the
crematorium as well. If there
were a major attack on this
country, or on our allies, we
would be forced to retaliate
with nuclear weapons. The only
alternative would be to
surrender.”

and I could not be more in
accord.
We shall never do any good
with that type ; for the next
generation, at least, they will
blame the West and “coloni-
alism,” not only for the present
disabilities of their people, but
for their own failure to bring
about overnight that Utopia
which they promised would
ensue almost automatically on
the end of foreign rule.
With a few notable excep-
tions, we can’t trust them, but
at the same time there is no
need to present them with
ammunition to use against us.
Nor should we, by turning our
backs on Asia, present the
Communists with an open, un-
guarded door.
For years to come the
poverty and ignorance of the
mass of Asian peasants and
workers will be a barrier to
direct contact and influence. In
any case, those proletarians
will be doing what somebody
tells them for a long time yet.
However, there is in every
Asian country a numerous
and influential educated class,
intelligent enough to see where
tinkering with Communism is
likely to lead them; and to
realise that isolation from the
West, on the other hand, can
lead countries like Indonesia
and Thailand nowhere but
round and round in circles.
It is through those educated
Asians that our overtures of
friendship must be made; not
by propaganda—they will never
fall for that—but by offering
a helping hand whenever the
opportunity occurs; and, for
the rest, by minding our own
business. But it will take a long
time—and we shall have to
mean it.— Jas. Macansh (Q.).
An Author Replies
My thanks to Messrs.
Gallagher and Shean for their
comments on my book The
Red Ruin Mare (B. 30/ 4/’5B).
They point-out errors in con-
struction, and they do it nicely
■—just as effectively with a
rapier as with a bludgeon. For
their benefit: I think I pointed-
out in the context that a mickey
was a soldier-bird, noisy miner,
and then for good measure in
the glossary also stated it
referred to a bull-calf up to
about a year old. Messrs.
G. and S. (and that doesn’t
refer to Gilbert and Sullivan)
can take their pick. I can
only tell them I’ve seen
a cock - emu kill a cat
—I cannot prove it by a
demonstration. The incidents
were much the same, though,
of course, they did not run in
the sequence as given in the
book. I repeat: I thank Messrs.
G. and S. There is an old rule
about such things: “Say good
if you can; say bad if you
must; but say something.”
They certainly said plenty!
HENRY G. LAMOND (Q.).
“The Shifting Heart”
Let us take a look at the
problem from which the moral
“That's Wun Wing Lo.”
of this play originated (B.
7/5/’5B).
For every Gino who is
kicked to death in a street-fight
or dance-hall brawl there is a
George who is knifed in a pub-
brawl. But in all fairness to the
many Italians in our com-
munity and to the street pushes
who have their own code-of-
honor, there are very few
Harrys and Ginos in our
society.
Personally, I am always wary
of the Italian youth who, having
been in Australia since his
childhood, is still offside with
his former schoolmates. I
have found that any question
of non-acceptance of a local at
a local dance stems from
something deeper than mere
racial intolerance.
I am also wary of the
teenager, Italian or Australian,
who gladdens dear ole Mum’s
heart with a decorated,
Christmas-tree. I feel there is
more than a slight possibility
that the tree may have been
won in a raffle at the pub.
But, on the question of accep-
tance or otherwise of New
Australians in our community,
I would like to raise the
example of the N.A. con-
vertee to the Australian Rules
code of football. Victorians
re S ard these enlightened youths
rar . e delight. Having a
pathological urge to thrust the
code down the throat of every-
one Australia, they become
transported with joy when a
N.A. willingly adopts ’Rules,
indicating that, despite his un-
fortunate background, he has
the ma kings of a man.
Richard Beynon has spot-
lighted the problems of assimi-
lation, but he has not developed
any recognisable, fair-dinkum
Australian theme. Because the
lady next-door uses a few un-
ladylike Australian colloqui-
alisms, and because Maria’s
husband in the play speaks with
the frankness and phraseology
of the carrier down the street,

N.S.W. Railways
“Y. Mee” (B. 2/4/’5B) is
the sort of critic who gives
any Railway Commissioner
ulcers. What does he want?
He berates the department
for not giving better first-
class travel for the money,
yet is “nauseated” when fare-
dodgers and scalers are dealt
with by the courts. He can’t
have it both ways.
The main object of first-
class travel is to reduce crowd-
ing and give more space, and
that was why I paid the extra
on my last, very hurried trip
to the Mountains 10 years ago.
Business seemed to be boom-
ing when I joined the train at
Katoomba, and, after giving-up
my corridor-seat to an old
lady, I was left with the choice
of either sitting on the arm
of her seat or seeing nothing.
When the “crowns” came
through, the couple in the
window-seats paid the differ-
ence with a bad grace, the
blonde behind didn’t; she had
neither ticket, money, nor, I.
suspect, morals. That went on
right through the car, and
when I tried to raise hell about
it I was told no action could
be taken so long as there was
an offer to pay. If anything
was “nauseating,” that was.
As for the legal action
brought to recover the sum of
threepence, where he suggests
that somebody (not the scaler)
should have tossed the money
into the kitty rather than go
through all the motions, let
him be more specific and say
who should contribute the
trey. And if threepence this
week, why not three-bob next
and three-quid the week after?
Who, would he suggest, is go-
ing to square the auditors?
Threepence or three million,
you’re dealing with public
money and you cannot depart
from the set rules, no matter
how silly it may seem. — Trans-
porticus (Singapore).
Victorian Transport
Finances
Faced with a loss last year of
£3 million on metropolitan rail-
services and £1 million on tram-
services, the Victorian Govern-
ment plans to co-ordinate rail-
and tram-fares as one means
of reducing future deficits.
First step in the plan would
be the substitution of one-class
rail-fares at rates fixed some-
where between those of the
present two classes. First-class
passengers would benefit finan-
cially by the change ; but, as
second-class travellers prepon-
derate, the department would
gain overall. Other gains
would be simplified ticket-
printing, less clerical work and
less activity for members of
the “flying gang,” part of
whose job is to detect
passengers with second-class
tickets travelling first.
At least it will be an oppor-
tunity to remove the many in
consistencies which exist in the
present system of fixing rail-
fares. Mile for mile, fares to
railway-stations near tram- or
bus-routes are lower than fares
to stations outside the competi-
tive areas. Tram fares will also
need to be raised, as they are
generally lower than rail-fares.
The perpetual state of near-
brokeness in which both
services find themselves
demands that something be
done, apart from increased
efficiency (which is rarely
mentioned), t o put their
finances on a near-even keel. —
Fontaine (Vic.).
Wider Use of Wool
With wool the preponderant
factor in our economy, and
prices for our export-clip
dropping, the increase in its use
for the home market becomes
of paramount importance.
Whilst the manufacturers of
woollen suiting-cloths have
done a good job, shirts and
underclothing leave much still
to be desired. The beautiful
lustre of wool as it leaves the
sheep’s back, so evident on the
table during sorting, too often
seems to disappear in the woven
material. Something should
be done by the processors to
preserve this silky appearance
and give the finished article
greater attractiveness.
The production of a non-
crease woollen base-cloth is an
encouraging sign that manu-
facturers realise the need for
unrelenting research to give
wool the glamor and attraction
for buyers which they can get
in synthetic materials, with the
added qualities which wool
alone possesses. Tiddles
(W.A.).
Hire-purchase
One aspect of h.-p. that
doesn’t seem to have been
touched-on is the contribution
it is making to industrial peace.
No longer can men go on strike
with impunity. A few weeks
out of work and the threat of
repossession looms. In the
days when it was only a matter
of finding enough for tucker
during the period of strike
(the rent could and did wait)
a strike could be undertaken
more or less lightly. Now it
often resolves itself into the
simple question of whether to
skip the strike or risk losing the
car, TV or washing-machine.
And here Mum often has a say
“The Shifting Heart” still does
not become one of the great
plays of the day reflecting a
truly national portrait.
Perhaps if there were more
Marias married to Australians
and more Ginos married to
Marys, or if there were even
more Marias available for the
young Italian men in Aus-
tralia, we would not be con-
fronted with the problems of
assimilation w'hich have not
even begun to exercise the
minds of the Parliamentary
pundits.
Snowy-on-the-trams will tell
you Tony is a pretty good
workmate, but Tony, when he
gets home from his job to his
crowded tenement in Carlton or
Fitzroy, is a different Antonio
from Snowy’s workmate. He
becomes fiercely nationalistic.
The fearful slums of Naples are
forgotten ; he is a completely
mixed-up young Italian aware
of a smouldering antipathy in
a strange land. As Antonio
seeks solace in the “grappa”
and the company of his own
kind, he becomes a menace to
the society he has adopted and
which, it was expected, would
adopt him.
We native-born admit the
Tonys are good workers and
good migrants, but we would
exile them to the remote
regions where wild horses
wouldn’t drag us. Then, when
Tony makes a success of his
undertaking and brings out his
family, we condemn him for
living in communities and
refusing to be assimilated.
We can thank Richard
Beynon for reviving interest
in the problems of the Ginos,
Marias and Tonys, but topical
interest in a social problem
does not necessarily make a
first-rate play, although it goes
a long way towards making a
light treatment stand up to
the slings and arrows of out-
rageous critics.—

Kashmir
Agree with “R.R.D.” (B.
23/4/’5B) that the Kashmir
dispute has dragged on long
enough ; but have little hope
that U.N. will act either
promptly or firmly to settle it.
Kashmir having been more
or less quiet for some years,
people out of touch with the
area probably thinks that hot
blood has cooled, and that a
happy ending to the story is
only a matter of time. How-
ever, time may not work
towards that end much longer.
One would think that, all
parties having had 10 years ; n
which to ruminate quietly, the
Kashmiris could be left to
decide their own future nation-
ality ; but will India consent
to that apparently simple solu-
tion? Not without a great deal
of persuasion.
I feel sure that, under the
surface, tension is so high that
some trifling incident could at
any moment touch-off an
explosion of mob-violence, and
through that a renewal of war
between India and Pakistan.
Within the last few months I
have heard intelligent, Western-
educated Indians speak of
Kashmir with a bitterness
which surprised and disturbed
me. The Kashmiris’ point of
view was not mentioned.
“Claims he's an expert in hand-to-hand fighting, sir.”
The justice of the dispute has
little practical bearing on the
matter, nor has the interest of
the Kashmiri populace;
emotion, rather than reason,
will govern the disputants’
attitude towards acceptance.
If the parties to the present
truce don’t come to a workable
agreement some irresponsible
rabble-rouser will sooner or
later start the bush-fire
“R.R.D.” fears. Probably
Russia’s rulers are able and
ready to supply the neces-
sary match whenever war
in that area would fit their
larger plan. Meanwhile the
Kremlin will keep Kashmir
“on the ice’’ —if they can. The
initiative should not be left in
Russian hands.
The possibility of friendship
and free intercourse between
Indians and Pakistanis is
scarcely worth discussing ; but
from this distance the material
interests of the two nations
seem so interdependent that
religious differences and
memories of old wrongs should
not be allowed to prevent co-
operation at Government level
in the field of trade and com-
merce.
There may be nothing that
we can do about it here ; more’s
the pity, because an early settle-
ment of the Kashmir trouble,
and establishment of good-
neighbor relations between
India and Pakistan would be a
serious setback for Com-
munism in that region. —Carl
Helmar (Q.).
Exit the Private Motor-car?
It might not happen for
some years, or even decades,
but the days of the private
car must surely be numbered.
Already it is hinted in Vic-
toria that metropolitan road-
users will be rostered even
registration-numbers on even
dates, the others on odd dates.
But this won’t solve the
problem. There are many
factors which are developing
to bring about this change and
they’re all converging on the
target —the private car.
From an economic point of
view, private cars are con-
sumer-goods. They need up-
keep and repair, but depreciate
out of existence in time.
Millions of pounds’ worth of
cars flow through our cities
every morning and evening.
They mostly contain one
occupant. They mostly remain
parked in the city area all day.
This huge capital - waste
doesn’t end there. It is further
inflated by the costs of spares

and accessories ; the establish-
ment and maintenance of
petrol-stations and garages ;
import of petrol and oils;
accident-repairs; licensing of
vehicles and drivers; con-
struction and maintenance of
roads; policing and costs of
traffic-controls.
And for what return?
Socially, the motor-car
doesn't hold the appeal it used
to. As a driver of over 30
years’ accident-free experi-
ence, the prospect of a
pleasant Sunday - afternoon
drive with the family prompts
in me a silent prayer for
survival.
Politically, the problem is
developing twofold. There is
the continual loss on public
transport, which needs to be
subsidised at the expense of the
whole community. Secondly,
the increasing clamor for
better and cheaper public
transport, like Melbourne’s
long - promised underground
railway. To this can be added
the resentment at the persecu-
tion of parkers in the city
areas, and the eventual blight
which will affect retail trade in
the larger cities.
No politician can afford to
vote out of existence the huge
capital - outlay on public
transport, particularly the
suburban railways. Likewise,
increasing city development—
mostly vertically—will bring
more people into the city. Not
all will be retail shoppers, but
they will still add to all existing
problems of transport, parking,
traffic-control and even foot-
path-space.
Retail shopping will move
to the outer suburbs, where
super-markets or shopping-
“My idea of a butiyip .”
centres will create similar
traffic-problems.
Lastly—the most important
factor of all the tragic
slaughter and maiming on the
roads will have to be stopped.
If a similar number of
accidents happened as the
result of any other cause
—exploding gas-stoves, faulty
electrical appliances, or tinned
foods, for example there
would be a national outcry,
and royal commissions would
be working overtime. But road-
accidents are accepted as the
normal premium to be paid for
the development of the motor-
car.
The answer to all these
problems must lie in some form
of banning of the private car.
This would not mean that it
would disappear from the roads
altogether. There would have
to be an efficient road-
transport system for com-
mercial users, and public
utilities. Primary producers
and country people would need
some form of licensed transport,
but the private motorist would
disappear completely from the
greater metropolitan areas, and
probably for some distance
beyond.
This would demand a com-
pletely revitalised public-trans-
port system within the banned
private-car areas. If the whole
system of suburban railways,
with connecting bus-services,
was brought up to a luxury-
standard, and the timetables
operated on very fast schedules,
few would want to drive their
cars into the cities. With the
large patronage that such a
move would bring, fares would
be lower. The capital-costs of
the huge conversion would be
adequately met from the
economic savings of the
present wasteful system.
The release from employ-
ment of thousands engaged in
the motor-trade and associated
activities need not be a tragedy
They could be employed on
more beneficial work.
The present waste could be
converted into an asset. We
might, for example, eliminate
slums ; have more homes with
labor-saving aids; preserve
our beauty spots; look-after
our aged and infirm more
humanely ; and generally do a
lot of useful things which are
now shelved by the old excuse
of lack of funds. —W. H.
Emberson (Vic.).
Australian Magazines
Eve Merritt (B. 5/3/’5B) hits
the nail on the head about
Australian freelance writers
receiving a raw deal from the
publishers of some Australian
magazines.
Anyone who cares to check
through a few issues of some
of the large-circulation publi-
cations will find plenty of
proof that overwhelming
preference is given to over-
seas fiction-writers. It is
common to find in one issue
three or four short-stories by
American or English authors,
with setting, language and
themes that have little relation
to the Australian way of life,
and not a single story by an
Australian writer. Novels
published in serial form are
almost invariably overseas
“best-sellers.”
Are Australian fiction -
writers as inferior as implied
by the policy? The evidence
of their work, published in
The Bulletin and a few other
'papers that give the writer a
fair go, suggests that this is
not so, and that, given
adequate encouragement, local
authors are capable of giving
Australian magazines high-
quality fiction.
Would the leading American
magazines entertain the sug-
gestion that they should give
preference in space to English
authors, to the detriment of
American? —D. J. G. (Vic.).

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
MIRACLE-WORKER
HUMPHREY KEMPE,
pastoralist and ex-Light
Horseman of 1914-18, has
written a book, The Astonished
Earth (Heinemann), because
he saw a miracle happen, and a
miracle, too, under his own
hands. And because this
reviewer saw some of it with
him, and perhaps also from
World War I memories (which
had nothing to do with it), he
was invoked from 13,000
miles away, along with The
Bulletin, to help entice the
present generation of Aus-
tralians, and all others, to
appreciate the astonishment of
Kempe’s earth. (That title, by
the way, is borrowed from
Virgil).
The said earth adjoins the
Lindsay creek, a side-arm of
the Murray in the vicinity of
the old Ned’s Corner sheep-
station, which is west-south-
west of the region where
N. S. Wales, Victoria, and
South Australia meet. Adjoin-
ing the Lindsay, on the south,
the flats were so baked,
hardened and naked under
droughts and wind-erosion, so
impervious to rain, that storm-
water simply lay and boiled
and evaporated. No grazing
was possible. Beyond the flats
the red sand lay in low ridges,
saved from blowing away by
stunted mallee or tobacco-bush
“Easy on the Water , Fred , but don't spare
the brilliantine."
or porcupine-grass, and here a
picking might be found, or the
sandalwood branches could be
pulled down, for perhaps a few
head of stock to the square-
mile. Somewhere in that
country the old Paringa station
met Ned’s Corner. Incidentally,
hereabouts was the last piece of
Australia ridden behind stock
by “The Breaker” Morant, and
this reviewer, as a boy, rode
with him there for a few days
by special invitation.
After World War I a number
of Light Horsemen, who had
been creating a bit of astonish-
ment for Gyppos, Arabs and
Levantines generally in the
course of duty, took-up Ned’s
Corner in company, eventually
drifted apart, and Kempe, one
of them, found himself on the
piece of it called Millewa (with
a frontage on the Murray). So
should run the full introduction
to this story, but Kempe does
not recite it. He begins his
account, that is the perpetrat-
ing of the miracle, just before
the start of World War II:
I had sold the homestea'd portion
of the property, and while deciding
where in the more settled districts
we might live and complete the
children’s education, war developed.
We remained; but rather forlornly
on the river’s ( i.e the Lindsay’s)
edge facing a scalded plain.... a
soil so despoiled and barren as to
succour few desert plants . . .
Into this soil a plough could
hardly be made to bite. It was
on these flats, abutting on the
Lindsay, that
we resolved to attempt to grow an
irrigated pasture, in an area where
climate, soil, delivery of sufficient
water, grassland economy and
much public opinion did not in any
manner favor such a project. To
attempt to be drought-free in a
region where the incidence of
drought is common and high
bordered on the fantastic.
But Kempe has done it.
There were no precedents to
follow, estimates of cost were
mere guess-work, a war was on
that would soon play Old
Harry with all supplies and
spare-parts. But ‘‘we took heart
at the chance remark of an old
employee that we could grow
something on a salty brick if
we had to, put a plough into a
small patch of the least intract-
able soil, and in 1939 Lindsay
Point had started. It started
with a quarter-acre and a 30-
gallon-per-minute pump.”
In 1939 the area had not
even a name. Today Lindsay
Point is known in select
quarters of England and Italy
and everywhere where White
Clover receives due respect. In
ten years the undertaking was
proved beyond doubt, “ten
exciting, frustrating, some-
times impossible years.” Now
on land formerly inhabited by
only whirlwinds and mirages,
land which water would not
even penetrate, Kempe can
stand in knee-high, hip-high
pasture-grasses, or negotiate in
the shade of willows, poplars
and athel trees the sale of fat
lambs of a specified weight at a
specified future date. Higher
up, in the once barren sand-
ridges, there have arisen under
spray-irrigation green-pea crops,
followed, as the soil is redeemed
and nourished, by growing
acres of oranges.
The name of the prime agent,
under Providence, of this
miracle is clover. Water, of
course, too, pumped from the
Lindsay by annually augmented
diesel plants, and draining back
into the Lindsay in the gentle
gradient which Kempe early
detected in the lay of the land ;
but the indispensable subter-
ranean worker, the prime
healer, restorer and fertiliser
(nitrogen) of the exhausted soil,
the daily flesh - and - bone
builder on sheep and cattle, is
clover:
Clover, clover, clover [sings
Kempe], this family, this legumin-
ous colony, may prove next to water
and soil to be worth more than
any other material thing we pos-
sess. Few countries, none tropical,

chants them as to music. Like
the Victorian irrigation-farmer
cited by the agronomist Bartels,
he kneels in adoration before
White Clover. And, indeed, it
has made this spot of Australia
famous in the home of White
Clover, Italy. Not only has
Kempe been to Milan and Lodi,
“where the most perfectly laid-
out areas of White irrigated
Clover in the world are to be
seen,” but the Italian experts
have been out on return-
visits to Lindsay Point, as have
also British enthusiasts; and
their verdict is that even in
the home of clover there is
none of it to beat what Kempe
is growing on the once-barren
stretch of stunted bluebush
recorded on antiquated survey-
plans as Old George’s Paddock.
Well might that earth be
astonished!
Kempe reads as though he
wanted helping with the build-
up of his story here and there,
and his illustrations, some of
them in color-photographs, are
very useful in that respect.
Lindsay Point is already a
Mecca for Australian irriga-
tion-farmers and pastoralists,
especially those who pump their
own water-supplies, and above
all for those whose ears have
been opened to the gospel of
clover and the scientific restora-
tion of abused soil. He has
read widely in the history of
past civilisations that died
with, first, the natural trees and
grasses, then the rainfall, and
then the soil; he knows the
Egyptian and Arabian scene
from his Light Horse days ; and
he interlards his local and tech-
nical account with reflections
on the natural explanation of
the rise and fall of nations by
their agriculture.
As it happened, Kempe had
just four years’ start before
“the great drought of 1943, ’44
and ’45” —drought combined
with war-time scarcity of vital
materials for repair and exten-
sion of pumping plant, con-
creting channel-heads, fencing,
and transport of everything. He
began, as has been said, with a
quarter-acre of the inhospitable
flats. During the first plough-
ing not an earthworm, not an
insect, was to be seen ; after the
first year an odd worm showed-
up. Whence and how? No
answer. The first seeding was
with Japanese millet: “This
germinates easily, is a sala-
mander for heat, grows fast,
provides a good tufty root and
is good stock-fodder. On the
bad lands that would be dry
48 hours after flood-irrigation
it was watered just so often, if
our fifth-hand, 1920-type, one-
cylinder diesel-engine could be
prevented from pre-igniting.”
The water had to be dis-
tributed gently to enable the
millet-roots to get a hold in
the clay before it became hot
and hard. By this means “we
got a probable 50 per cent,
germination and root.” The
millet made some headway,
though the winds were un-
broken (as now they are by trees
and other growth) and wild
duck were attracted by the green
shoot and the surface water.
Then the stock were let in ;
after them the “very fair” root-
growth, stalk-waste and stock-
droppings were disked-in and
next year the plot, tempered
with liberal strewing of gypsum,
was sown with a mixture of
lucerne, Bokhara Clover and
Wimmera grass.
The end of the second season
saw the departure of “hunger
signs” in the Wimmera rye,
and by this time 20 acres was
under this step-by-step nursery-
treatment. Each year another
20 acres were added. “In the
third year of each plot we
stepped-up the seeding pro-
grame .... a mixture of White,
Strawberry, Subterranean
Cluster, Barrel, Bokhara and
Red Clovers, Wimmera and
perennial rye-grass, Prairie,
Kentucky Blue, Rhodes, Cocks-
foot, Phalaris grass-seeds, and
hand-plantings of Kikuyu. By
the time the drought hit Lind-
say Point, Kempe was preparing
the last paddock of the original
homestead section, size (17
acres) determined, as were all
the other paddocks, by its
reticulated contour; the
pastures already created saved
the stock; and the next
development was with the
second area called Deep Point.
On laying-out contours for
his irrigation bays, Kempe has
this: The fall in the slope
between bank-base and bank-
base should be not more than
3in., this determining size of
bay, though type of soil
(rapidity of absorption) also
affects it. Surveyors and instru-
ments being scarce, Kempe and
his son used the water itself.
A very high river-flood gave
them their lowest contour ; they
drove a plough along the line
of it. Then they threw up a
bank, pumped in water, and
when this had risen against the
contour-bank to the requisite
3in.-level, the plough was
driven along the higher edge
of the water and so the next
contour-bank outlined. And
so on.
A parting picture of the con-
ditions Kempe surveyed,
matched his intelligence
against, and subdued. He is
writing of Deep Point, and it
is a good sample of how he
can use a pen:—
A locality known for years by
stockmen and musterers as Deep
Point because that is how the wan-
dering river shaped it... .survived
various attempts to rename it
Windy Point, as in Deep Point
everyone seemed to recognise some
relief, a narcosis of association,
from a remorseless air-movement
which on this most exposed part
of the property never stilled.
Mustering in the early summer
mornings the wind may here wander
and be gentle; in the frost at
dawn, when stayed elsewhere, it
perhaps only seeks with cold instead
of slicing; but sooner or later
every day it will gear itself from
good windmill-power to a stand-in
for an Arabian simoon. In the
worst drought years car headlights
may help to find the track through
sweeping sand, but white-painted
posts every chain or two are better;
and so, after taking the precaution
of bolting-down the pumping-plant
shed, and securing it further by
guys of five-eighths of an inch
steel rod, we called the new area
Deep Point, tried to forget the
wind, and went on seeding and
ploughing and planting windbreaks.
Today it sems an almost tame and
tolerable locality.
The clovers (in first instance)
have pushed both wind and
mirages away.

A Good Yield
“Olym”: Now that the
Wimmera harvest (B. 5/ 2 / ’5B)
is finished, local silos hold two-
thirds as much again as they
did at the corresponding time
last year. There have also been
higher yields than the 16-bags-
per-acre reported early in the
harvesting.
One of the best is the 3354
bags taken from a 170-acre
paddock by Sudholz Brothers,
of Natimuk (Vic.), who
atribute this high yield to that
particular paddock having been
under barrel clover and
Wimmera rye-grass during the
previous five years’ spell.
They harvested it expedi-
tiously, too —in one day they
took off 1400 bags with two
12ft. headers.

FROM LEADING STOCK & STATION AGENTS
so superior to the old type thai
farmers and graziers on the
Darling Downs (Q.) have sown
it exclusively this season.
The succulent, sweet stems
are relished by all classes of
stock, and milking-cows do well
on it. As it is finer in the stalk,
it makes much better hay than
does the ordinary variety.
Although the sweet sudan is
not so quick or tall, it will give
more feed per acre, as every
stalk is eaten, and the plants
are eaten right down to the
ground. On the Downs,
animals are turned into the
crop when it is from 12in. to
15in. high, and there have been
no reports of stock-losses.
The rate of sowing is from
81b. to 101 b. per acre in drills,
or 121 b. to 151 b. broadcast.
Thicker sowing is recom-
mended, as this produces a fine
stem which is more palatable
than when the canes are thick
and coarse. Blood, bone and
super is the best fertiliser, and
should be applied at the rate of
from lcwt. to 2cwt. per acre.
Pig-keeping
“Dairy Air”: The owner of
three sows apparently capable
of making their escape from
the best of enclosures, I solved
the problem this way:
Using ordinary fence-posts
4yds. apart with eight-wire
ringlock strained from ground-
level along the inside of the
posts, two plain wires were
strained with a barb on top.
Finally, logs—the longer and
straighter the better —were
laid along the ground on the
inside against the wire and
“bullocky-twitched” to the
posts, the ringlock fastened to
the logs at intervals.
I vouch for the success of
this method after a trial of
12 months.
Wild Pigs
“Myall”: “Abdul” (B.
12/ 3/ ’5B) is wrong when he
writes “that wild pigs are un-
eatable, unless a man is
starving.”
In times of drought, that
might be so. In bounteous
seasons, when the pastures are
lush, billabongs and water-
holes full, and the scrubs are
abounding in edible roots,
berries and native fruits, the
wild pig is practically vege-
tarian and its flesh has no
trace of the carrion taste
“Abdul” complains of. As
cattle and sheep are strong and
active, pigs seldom or never
attack them,, and there is no
carrion to be devoured. In
dry times, when pastures are
dry and often bare, the pigs
turn to whatever food they
can find, and, as cattle and
sheep are dying everywhere,
they naturally turn carnivorous.
In good seasons pigs feed
on nothing but the best, unlike
their domesticated brothers,
who must eat whatever is fed
them, or starve. “Abdul” says
that to try to fatten wild pigs,
or to breed from a wild sow,
is unprofitable, but only a
lunatic would try to do that
when almost-pedigreed animals
can be bought for a few quid.
No one denies that the only
good wild pig is a dead one,
but that doesn’t alter the fact
that its flesh is as good eating
as any other, provided the
season is good. If “Abdul”
were served with chops from
a half-grown wild pig, caught
during a lush season, he would
enjoy it as much as dairy-fed
pork.
For years I worked on a
West Queensland station where
the homestead was kept in
fresh pork and bacon from
pigs running wild on the pro-
perty. The hams and one side
would be cured, and the
balance eaten fresh or pickled.
There was never any taint of
carrion, and I have never
tasted better pork, fresh or
cured.
Round Farrowing-pen
“Van”: Apropos some
mention on this page of the
round farrowing-pen for sows
—the idea is a good one, but
each farmer should adapt it to
meet his own conditions. It
would be silly for a man with
a satisfactory layout for
example, conventional Bft.-by-
-Bft. concrete farrowing-pens
—to build more farrowing-
pens on the round principle at
a cost of £lO each. Surely the
idea can be interpreted in a
square house as easily as in a
round one?
Provided there is a 3ft. space
between the iron - grilled
enclosure and the rear wall —
and I would still use the
farrowing-rail there is no
reason why the square house
wouldn’t be as effective. With
a square house two doors would
be simpler, so the sow could
enter by one, continue round
the grilled enclosure, which
would be on the wall between
the two doors or gates, and
come out the other. Draughts
would be eliminated by this
front wall.
It would be convenient to
have the iron-grilled enclosure
(for want of a better name)
movable, so that it could be
shifted to another house as the
need arose and leave more room
as the suckers grew.
Don’t think I’m advocating
square houses as opposed to
round, but I am suggesting that
farmers can adopt the idea
quickly and cheaply by modify-
ing the round-house space-
measurements to their existing
layout.
Water-testing
“F.”: Using new methods of
analysis, the N.S.W. Depart-
ment of Agriculture is pro-
viding more comprehensive
reports on farm-water than
previously—and in a much
shorter time.
One of the features of the
new methods was the conduc-
tivity-test, which measured
the water sample’s resistance
to the passage of an electric-
current.
This showed the percentage
of mineral matter in the
sample, and took only a few
minutes instead of the hours
necessary to get the same
information by the old method
involving weighing and
evaporation.
Other developments have
made possible an even fuller
report on the value of the
water.
Landholders are advised not
simply whether the water is
suitable for irrigation, for
example, but, if its value is
limited, on which crops it may
be used, and corrective
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(8/5/'58)
Queensland should receive general rains in June, bring-
ing temporary relief to the dry areas of the State. Rainfall
should again be patchy during spring.
General rains are likely in N.S.W. during June, with
the heaviest falls occurring in the southern divisions. Rain-
fall should vary from moderate to reasonably good during
July, but, apart from the central and southern divisions, the
State can expect patchy rains mainly below normal during
spring.
Victoria should receive general rains during June and
July, with flooding in the rivers in the northern division,
South Gippsland and the Wimjyiera. Good rains should
follow in the southern half of the State.
General rains should occur in Southern Australia during
June, and well-distributed rains are likely in the agricultural
areas until October. Rainfall should be poor in the interior
during spring.
General rains are indicated in the whole of Western
Australia during June, with heavy falls on the coast between
Geraldton and Bunbury.

A report on water intended

a simple treatment to make the
water fit for stock, or more
palatable to them.
In the last nine months the
chemist’s branch of the
department has tested 1400
samples of farm-water, and
advised landholders on their
value.
This was more than twice the
number of s*amples submitted in
an average year.
The increase was un-
doubtedly caused by the long
dry spell and the need of
many farmers to use whatever
water was available, and an
awareness of the value of the
information provided by the
water-testing service of the
branch.
The department’s water-
testing service is free to the man
on the land.
Where samples are sub-
mitted they should be in clean
glass bottles of not less than
1-pint capacity.
The bottle should be labelled,
corked, securely packed against

to:

A letter giving details of the
sample and proposed use of the
water is desirable.
"Bras'* for Ewes
“Muroon”: Scientists who
are studying the milk-produc-
tion of sheep have fitted a sort
of brassiere on the ewe’s udder,
so that the lamb cannot drink
from it. At the same time the
lamb can run with the ewe, and
doesn’t experience the bad
effects of being separated from
its mother.
The ewe’s milk-production
is measured by the ingenious
technique of removing the
“bra” and allowing the lamb to
drink. The difference in the
lamb's weight before and after
drinking is the weight of milk
produced.
Results to date indicate that
some Merinos produce just as
much milk as crossbred ewes
(thus exploding a fallacy) and
that ewes which regr two lambs
produce more milk thin those
with singles.
“Bras” have been used
successfully on cows with
pendulous udders.

harm Hints
“Wilco”: After a spell of
rain it is often noticed that
battery-radios do not perform
too well for quite a while,
This is due to the damp getting
into the works, and, though no
lasting damage may be done
most times, transformers can
be ruined by it. There will
be a great improvement if the
chassis is taken out of the
cabinet and allowed to air for
a few hours on the first dry
day. Or keep a lighted hurri-
cane lantern behind the set
while the rain is on.

Despite reports of riots, rebellions and
rampages abroad, Sydney went along as
usual this week, attending to its business,
having some fun, doing some good, laugh-
ing and grumbling, enjoying the cool,
sunny weather.

Animals were in the news. The Tivoli
advertised for an “old white horse, sway-
back essential” for its gay new show,
“Sugar and Spice.” They received only
one application, which shows that if one
waits long enough, getting on the stage
will be an easy matter.
Then there is the elephant at David
Jones’ main store. He is living in the
basement for a week and signs auto-
graphs with a rubber-stamp. Part of the
store’s 120th birthday celebrations, he is
a great draw for the kiddies, and even the
most sedate of adults are intrigued by how
they got him in there past all the glass
showcases.
Cat-lovers went to the Town Hall to
see the 28th annual championship show of
the Federal Cat Club of Australia, in
aid of Red Cross. There they saw nearly
300 entries, including three unusual
Burmese cats, which are darker and
smaller than the Siamese, to whom they
are related. There was also a Red Point
Siamese which is a cross between a
Siamese and a Red Persian, and of course
plenty of pure Persians. The entries for
the show were judged by Mrs. D.
Burnage, Mrs. L. Whyte and Mr. F. W.
Pearce.
And, of course, one must mention the
lions and lionesses who roamed around
the city all through the week. They were
attending the sixth national convention
of the Lions Club and they all looked
very happy and jolly. As well as a ball,
a barbecue, a fashion-parade and a get-
together, they had a parade through the
streets carrying their district-banners and
driving the £20,000 worth of ambulances
and buses which they have presented to
various organisations. Official hostess for
the week was Mrs. W. Berge Phillips
(Mosman), whose husband is the
southern-district governor.

Author Morris West gave a forceful
address at the literary luncheon arranged
by the auxiliary for the Crippled Chil-
dren’s Society at the Royal Empire
Society. The author of Children of the
Sun, which describes the poverty-stricken
conditions in Naples, Mr. West’s message
was that we Australians cannot afford
to live as if we were sufficient to our-
selves. If we don’t recognise that we have
a duty to those outside the borders of
our own country and achieve an under-
standing of those less fortunate than
ourselves, we are not going to survive.

The shock announcement at the annual
meeting of the Bush Book Club was
that by the end of March, 1959, the club
will be no more. Margaret Rutherford
and Stringer Davis, who had to rehearse
for a TV presentation from the Eliza-
bethan Theatre of Anouilh’s play “Time
Remembered,” spoke first at the meeting
and said that the club had done a tre-
mendous and triumphant work. It had
formed part of the life-blood of the
country, circulating literature to the out-
back, and now was going to do the grand
and dignified thing and retire at the
zenith and fulfilment of its work.
Miss Barbara Knox, president of the
Bush Book Club, said that it seemed that
the public libraries could now do a
satisfactory service, as it was estimated
that 90 per cent, of the population were
now “within reach” of a library. How-
ever, the Bush Book Club would con-
tinue to function for another year, and
when it retired next March it would be
50 years old. Mr. Morris West also spoke
at the meeting. Mrs. Charles Dean (New-
castle) and Mrs. Barton Foster proposed
the votes of thanks.
The conference of the Far West Chil-
dren’s Health Scheme was attended by
country delegates, some from as far
afield as Broken Hill and the S.A. border.

who is chairman-elect «of the Far West
Council and formerly a Deputy Director
of Education in N.S.W. The Hon. H. S.
Roberton, M.P., Minister for Social

Flags flew, bands played and search-

a guard-of-honor for the Vice-Regal party
for the gala premiere of the British film
“Dunkirk.” Inside the theatre there were
superb floral decorations and satin
banners depicting London scenes.
Lady Brooks wore a short theatre-
ensemble of ice-blue satin, the front
panels of the coat and the square neck-
line of the frock embellished with gold
and crystal beads. The Lady Mayoress
(Mrs. F. W. Thomas) wore a full-length
gown of white satin which carried a green
floral-design. Mrs. Norman Carlyon
(her husband was chairman of the com-
mittee which organised the . premiere)
was attractive in a sheath-frock of heavy
white guipure-lace embroidered with
iridescent rhinestones. She was accom-
panied by her son Norman and brothers
Major-General lan Murdoch and Air-
Vice-Marshal Alastair Murdoch (and his
wife). Mrs. W. J. Kilpatrick, whose
husband is chairman of the Anti-Cancer
Campaign (which will benefit from the
premiere), chose a formal gown on
princess-lines of pale-blue satin.
Mrs. Graham Nathan wore a full-
length gown of white guipure-lace, Mrs.

N.Z. businessmen were too
preoccupied with problems at
home, have been revived, and
the mission may go in June
next year.
A deficit of £39.7 million was
recorded in N.Z.’s overseas-
exchange transactions for the
.year to March 31, compared
with a surplus of £BOO,OOO in
the previous year, the Reserve
Bank reports.
Main reason for the deteri-
oration of approximately £4O
million was an increase of
£31.9 million in payments for
private imports, which totalled
£266.2 million. Receipts of
overseas exchange fell by
£3.2 million to £317.8 million.
Butter-and-cheese receipts were
£lO.B million less than those in
1956-57, which in turn were
£6 million less than in 1955-56.
Wool receipts rose by £4.1
million to £lO2 million as a
result of high prices obtained
during the period April-June,
1957. The fall in prices this
season will be felt later. Meat
receipts increased by £2.5
million to 70.8 million. Pay-
ments for beef shipments to the
United States have helped to
offset lower prices for lamb
in the United Kingdom.
For the month of March
overseas-exchange transactions
showed a surplus of £2.8
million, against a surplus of
£5.2 million in February and
a surplus of £4.9 million in
March last year.
but the known minimal con-
ditions were considered suffi-
cient to warrant the establish-
ment of a treatment-plant for
the production of U3OB, to
which end the recently acquired
Northern Hercules gold-treat-
ment plant is being adapted.
In the absence of firm selling
arrangements exploratory
activities have been curtailed

Outlook for the venture is
no worse than it was, and
certainly better defined than
hitherto; however, the non-
appearance of a div. this year,
coupled . with the growing
awareness of the limitations
as well as the applications of
uranium, has lowered buyers’
bids for the scrip from Bs. 3d.
to 6s. in the last few

Lend Lease Corporation
'THIS interesting newcomer
proposes to carve itself a
niche in the financial world as
a landlord to industry, com-

development.
Well qualified for its role by
virtue of its affiliations and
experienced directorate, Lend
Lease Corp. has an authorised
capital of £2,000,000 in 10s.
shares. Initial issue totals
200,000 f.-p. shares, of which
116,900 have been offered to
the public at par. And since
outside funds are going to be
in demand, Stock Exchange
listing will be sought without
delay.
Another 80,000 shares have
been taken-up by the sponsor
of the float, Civil and Civic
Contractors Pty., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the big
Dutch construction co.,
Bredero’s Bouwbedrijf, N.V.
Since incorporation in 1951,
Civil and Civic has been
associated with varied and
substantial projects, including
contracts in connection with
the Snowy Mountains Scheme

these defences for the indefensible, you
defend it from Phillips’s own writing
in another essay? —“Finely responsive
reading is primarily an act of surrender,
only secondarily an act of judgment.”
That is the crux of the matter.
Examine McCrae from any logical
viewpoint and much of his poetry falls
to pieces ; “surrender,” and it is magic.
However, if I disagree here, it must
be mentioned that in the same essay
there is an admirable criticism of Henry
Handel Richardson’s prose style. And
similarly, if I find it difficult to under-
stand exactly what Arthur Phillips
wants in his plea to Canberra for more
money for culture —he does not give
precise enough consideration to
existing grants —I must add that lam
utterly disarmed by his extremely
precise analysis of a play called “Ned
Kelly” ... of which modesty forbids
me to say more than that I agree with
every word of it.
Douglas Stewart.
Melbourne Hospital
Beds and all, no history of a hospital
can expect to compete with “Peyton
Place” or “Forever Amber” ; but in
Hospital and Community, a History of
Royal Melbourne Hospital (Melbourne
University Press), K. S. Inglis has
succeeded better than one might have
imagined possible in keeping his
subject alive.
And that was more than could be
said about Melbourne Hospital last
century: as late as 1881 Dr. Youl. the
Melbourne coroner, remarked at one
of his many inquests into the deaths of
Melbourne Hospital patients, “If I had
a wound I would rather be treated in
a 640-acre paddock ” and after
something particularly devasting he
said during another inquest in 1876,
“seven patients fled from the wards
before they could be taken to the
operating-table.”
It was the kind of place where you
went in to have a leg off, and came
out, if at all, with erysipelas ; where
alcohol was a medicine —“one con-
sumptive girl drank, in 28 days at the
hospital, seven bottles of rum and 12
bottles of brandy (diluted, it is true,
with 61 bottles of soda-water)”; where
a surgeon, reporting an operation per-
formed in 1868, said, “I drew a lancet
from my pocket ...”
But it’s all very well to be amused
today by the campaign the old prac-
titioners put-up against newfangled
antiseptic methods ; by the misapplica-
tion made by enthusiastic younger
practitioners of Lister’s discoveries ; by
the effort to cut-down the hospital
death-rate by putting the patients in
canvas-covered frames in the hospital
grounds and stripping and burning the
canvas from time to time ; by the sys-
tem under which subscribers elected
doctors to the hospital and doctors can-
vassed votes and some doctors subsi-
dised subscribers . . . The details Inglis
gives show how vague and uncertain
were the new discoveries of anaesthetics
and antisepsis until late in the century ;
of bacilli they knew nothing at all, and,
as late as 1884, Dr. J. H. Webb was
among “the first in the world” to
suggest so daring an experiment as
“opening the abdomen” to operate for
appendicitis.
Still, Melbourne was 21 years behind
Sydney in nursing. Thanks to Henry
Parkes, says Inglis, Sydney infirmary
got Lucy Osburn in 1868 teaching the
Nightingale methods that raised nursing
from housemaiding to a profession ;
Melbourne having to wait until 1889
for Miss Rathie.
The first Melbourne hospital opened,
in 1848, had no bath until 1853 ; it
increased until 1910, when there was a
move to put-up a new hospital on a
new site at Parkville. The story of
how the hospital authorities were
offered £lOO.OOO provided they decided
on a suitable site in a limited time,
and of how Governments and councils
mucked them about, has, in Inglis’s
expert hands, the exasperating quality
of a suspense-thriller: the hospital was
of course 'rebuilt on the old site by
1913, was overcrowded and out-of-date
in ten years, staggered through the
depression and suffered the ignominy
of finance-by-totalisator until, by the
endless miracle of things that com-
mittees bring about, Stephenson’s fine
and functional building rose at Park-
ville in time for American occupation
in 1942 (it treated 42,000 sick and
wounded servicemen) before the Mel-
bourne Hospital patients began to
move into it in December, 1944.
And so, having dealt with buildings,
surgeons, nurses, finance, patrons,
benefactors, research and clinical train-
ing, Inglis comes to the important issue:
Who is entitled to public-hospital atten-
tion? And the reader should be pleased
to hear that he has good news for that
shady, cringing type of patient to which
the present reviewer belongs: the
patient who ought to be able to pay,
but hasn’t got the money. One gets
the impression that we are still not
exactly approved of, but they are
beginning to see our point of view.
THE SHADOW
Something in the landscape
attentive, stares at me ;
nothing's shape or shape of fear
it watches discreetly.
And / would fly away
far from its captive gaze
that tries to trap my wings
safe in its silent ways—
or being toad could hide
alone in the bubbling mud
and lost in secret darkness
grow jewels in my head;
or being fish could swim
away from its tender hand
that tries to coax me slyly
back to the stable sand —-
and yet 1 can’t avoid
its careful prying ways;
its tiny thread of pain
links my different days —•
or the way in a sudden street
it mocks and distorts me.
But when / am falling
it holds and. supports me.

VIVIAN SMITH.
Our Artistic Forebears
In The Prehistory of European
Society (Penguin-Pelican) the late Pro-
fessor Gordon Childe, of Sydney,
opened-up a fascinating graveyard.
His thesis is that all the main features
of European civilisation, its way of life
and its institutions, are by and large
merely extensions of prehistoric man’s
way of thinking and behaving.
The evidence is entirely archaeo-
logical. Primitive European man could
not write and his speech was probably
mainly mimetic noises. Nevertheless
he succeeded in establishing an
economic system based on barter, a
regular trade with the urban civilisa-
tions of Egypt and Asia Minor, which
had gained a start of several thousands
of years on him, just as we have gained
a start on the aboriginal, and develop-
ing craftsmanship of a high order. He
even imported craftsmen from the
more developed races. His political
institutions were the germ of our
modern Parliamentary systems, and
there was even a rudimentary trade-
union movement between the First Ice
Age and the Second.
Kings who owned their subjects were
apparently an Oriental invention which
was introduced aeons later. There
were chiefs, but they had to work for
their subsistence just like the man in
the street or the cave and there wasn’t
any nonsense about Divine Right or
descent or advowson, and prehistoric
man was too busy fighting the
mammoth and the sabre-toothed tiger
to bother about wasting his time on
wars of religion or succession.
The lands he roamed over in search
of food were perpetually either rising
above the level of the ocean or sinking
below its surface and the giant icecap
at the North Pole was perpetually
either advancing or retreating, so that
there were times when he could walk
across from Europe to England and


others when he had painfully to invent
means of ocean-transport.
The prehistoric savage hunts in
packs and begins to scratch the soil
and make implements to do it; but the
packs become larger and composed of
many units, each with minor leaders
who are able to subordinate their
private ambitions to the collective need
for food and shelter and protection
from the menace of the great beasts.
Thus began social organisation much
as we now know it.
This small bit of collective self-
abnegation produced such magnificent
results for the puny little animal, man,
that he has never lost the impression
it made on him, and the enormous awe
in which the princes of this world, its
officials and professors, are held is a
vestige of this feeling. However sadly
lacking in skill, courage, initiative and
self-knowledge they may be. they are
still symbols for the primordial
individual who pulled himself and his
fellows out of appalling chaos by his
own unaided efforts.
There were even religions, and the
germs of religious institutions. We
don’t know what the religion was or
what sort of deities were worshipped,
though it probably involved human
blood as a fertiliser and propitiator of
Nature. We do know, however, that
there were missionaries and saints who
crossed by land to England and built
houses so much stronger than their
fellows that peasant farmers were
induced to leave their precarious hold-
ings and shelter under God’s roof,
where they could indulge in contem-
plation more easily than they could
when being chased by a bear or tiger.
Thus spirituality arose, and with it
culture.
However, this does not explain the
sudden outburst of artistic expression
among the Magdalenians, a race which
appeared in southern and western
Europe during the long and discon-
tinuous retreat of the ice-sheets and
glaciers of one of the Ice Ages.
Suddenly, as if by magic, there
appeared on innumerable cave-walls
drawings of the animals the caveman
hunted which are as living as Rem-
brandt’s drawings tens of thousands
of years later. The movement must
have spread almost as quickly as the
modern idiom in painting, for caves
have been discovered in Spain,
Germany, Bohemia and France covered
with drawings in which deer and bison
are represented “with marvellous
sympathy, immediacy and accuracy, as
they were seen, undistorted by con-
ceptual thought,” to quote Professor
Childe.
Another interesting point made by
the professor is that European culture
got its inspiration not from the
abstract speculations of Egyptian
astrologers and Greek philosophers,
but from the craftsmanship of the
potter.
M. G. S.
Books of the Year
Each year the Australian Publishers’
Association holds a competition for the
best-produced books of the year, with
the laudable motive of encouraging
sound craftsmanship. They are not
concerned here with how well the book
is written; only how well it is printed;
and the idea is not merely to pick-out
de luxe editions but to select the best-
produced books in all fields from the
de luxe to the school textbook and the
paperback.
Books selected for 1957-58 were:
Offset Lithography, by Bruce Tory
(Horwitz Publications); Birds of New
Guinea, by Tom Iredale (Georgian
House); Anare, by Phillip Law and
John Bechervaise (Oxford); The Song
of Hagar, by Ethel Anderson (Edwards
and Shaw); A Layman’s Guide to
Creative Art, by D. Orban (Edwards
and Shaw); Piccaninny Walkabout, by
Axel Poignant (Angus and Robertson);
The Story of Koenworra, by Leslie
Rees (John Sands Pty., Ltd.); It
Happened One Summer, by Joan
Fhipson (Angus and Robertson); An
Introduction to Method in Psychology,
by W. M. O’Neil (Melbourne University
Press); In Black and While, by Ernest
C. Coleman (Oxford); New Land New
Language, edited by Judith Wright
(Oxford); Bayonet and Grass, by T.
Inglis Moore and The Dancing Bough,
by Nancy Cato (Angus and Robert-
son); Nine Dyak Nights, by W. R.
Geddes (Oxford); Sydney’s Great
Experiment, by Denis Winston (Angus
and Robertson); The Crisis in Victorian
PoMtks, 1879-1881, edited by J. A. La
Nauze and R. M. Crawford (Melbourne
University Press); Myths of the
Munkan, by Ursula McConnel (Mel-
bourne University Press); The Mel-
bourne Scene, 1803-1956, by James
Grant and Geoffrey Serle (Melbourne
University Press); Below These Hills,
by Ernest G. Moll (Melbourne Uni-
versity Press); and Democracy in the
Atomic Age, by Arnold J. Toynbee
(Oxford).
The Magazines
“Quadrant’’ has made news among
the little magazines by offering a prize
of £lOO. to be awarded each year for
the next five years “for the most out-
standing contribution”: a pleasant piece
of news, though it seems a pity to have
appointed overseas judges —Stephen
Spender and the American essayist
Irving Kristol. A “frame of reference,”
a knowledge of local conditions, is
always useful in judging a competition.
The current “Quadrant” has a short-
story by E. O. Schlunke, poems by
Mary Gilmore and A. D. Hope and
others, and two articles on the uni-
versities, including an analysis of the
Murray report.
“Southerly” (No. 41, 1958), in one of
the first perceptible touches of Kenneth
Slessor’s editorship—if one counts the
McCrae number as in the established
tradition—has a most amusing essay
by Edgar Holt on “the decline and
fall of leader-writing.” Holt has hidden
his graceful prose-style under a bushel,
or in a leader, far too long. There is
also a very well-balanced review by
S. L. Lee of Vincent Buckley’s “Essays
in Poetry.”
“Landfall,” the New Zealand
quarterly, along with its poetry, short-
stories and politics, discusses the choice
of Australian writers to be translated
by Uneseo into foreign languages: in
prose, Boldrewood, Lawson, Furphy,
Henry Handel Richardson, Katharine
Susannah Prichard and Frank Dalby
Davison ; in poetry. Kendall. Paterson,
O’Dowd and Slessor. “Landfall”
queries, as well it might, the inclusion
of O’Dowd and Kendall.
“Meanjin” (No. 1, 1958) contains
some reminiscences of Hugh McCrae
by Robert D. Fitz Gerald, Nettie
Palmer, Jack Lindsay and T. Inglis
Moore. Marjorie Barnard reviews Pat-
rick White’s “Voss” (very favorably)
and M. Aurousseau discusses its sources
from the historical viewpoint.
“The Australian Outlook” (March,
1958), a quarterly published by the
Australian Institute of International
Affairs, contains a variety of informa-
tive and authoritative articles on such
subjects as “Australia and Regional
Pacts,” the economics of the Philip-
pines, the Colombo Plan and U.S.
foreign policy.
The Roots of Heaven: Romain
Gary (Michael Joseph). A Prix Gon-
court success which is now going round
the world. Morel, the hero, is a
misanthropic idealist who, when a
Nazi prisoner, saw freedom as a herd
of elephants charging through the bush
and who, later in French Equatorial
Africa, quixotically but actively dedi-
cates himself to their protection against
slaughter. In this single-minded,
guerrilla-like task he is joined by an
oddly-assorted band, not all of whom
have the same transparency of motive.
The manner of narration —obtuse, non-
dimensional and repetitive—is exacting
upon the reader’s concentration, but
the allegorical outcome is tremendous,
being part reportage, part satire and
part vilification of mankind and his
traffic.
