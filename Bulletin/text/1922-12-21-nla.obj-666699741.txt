Freemasonry in the Middle East.
'“Secret Sects of Syria and the Lebanon,” by
Bernard H. Springett, P.M., P.Z.
(George Allen & Unwin.)
The general reader will not be greatly in-
trigued by the title of this book, and yet
those who venture within its covers will find
a surprising amount of interesting infor-
mation interestingly put together, though
without any great pretensions to literary
skill. A good deal of the information is not
new, and the author early acknowledges his
indebtedness to other authorities. Church-
ward, in his “Arcana of Freemasonry,” has
already dealt at length with the undoubted
antiquity of Masonic signs and symbols,
whilst the authorities on the Druses, the
Mohammedan religion and Syrian sects are
too numerous to be mentioned. What the
author seeks to prove is that Freemasonry
has been practised as part and parcel of prac-
tically all the religions of the Middle East
since the beginning of time, and that it is
not a modern invention, as many Masons,
who ought to know better, incline to believe.
Perhaps, however, they do not so believe,
but consider it politic not to discuss the
subject. As a matter of fact, most Masons
do not care a jot whether their craft origi-
nated in the East or the West, whether they
“came from the East and proceeded to the
West,” or anything at all about the matter.
But for those who do so care, Mr. Springett
has provided a sumptuous meal for con-
sideration, and, in addition, throws out some
suggestive thoughts on how Freemasonry
arrived, in ages long past, in South and
Central America, and was practised amongst
the Aztecs and other native tribes before in
its present form it obtained any hold in
Europe, or, at least, any acknowledged hold.
Ilow are we to explain an aboriginal Indian
chief possessing and practising the signs and
grips—unless, like Mr. Springett, we are
willing to believe in that lost continent of
Atlantis as the medium for the passage of
the mystic craft from East to West?
In Mexico, where Freemasonry has had a
great vogue, are lodges which trace their
traditions back beyond the days of Columbus.
The late Porfirio Diaz, who arrived at high
office in the craft, Avas a member of
such a lodge. But Mexican Free-
masonry retained to some extent its aristo-
cratic character, and Diaz was greatly
disgusted when a high Mason from the States
visited Mexico City, and, being entertained
by Grand Lodge, was revealed as a New
York hack-driver.
Research into this question is not new.
Leading lights in Masonry have been investi-
gating for a long time, and the records quoted
in this book go back for more than 200 years.
That the author is an enthusiast on the sub-
ject goes almost without saying, for this is
the kind of investigation that grips the mind
and almost makes a fanatic of-its servants.
No more thrilling subject can really be
imagined, for it carries right back to the
dim ages of Mahomet, to the earliest Bod-
isatvas, and links us Avith the Lamas ~of
Thibet, as offshoots of one great belief,
which, varying in details, has persisted right
doAvn to to-day.
Though the. author gives numerous illus-
trations of similarity of ritual, of signs and
symbols and of beliefs, no one at this dis-
. tance of time can definitely say that Free-
masonry is the direct descendant of the reli-
gion of Dorazi and the Druses, of the
Ismaeli, of the Assassins, of the Templars,
the Nusairi or of any other sect. On the
other hand, all these sects have points in
common, and some of them many points in com-
mon, with Freemasonry, and that they have
influenced the course and development of the
latter must be acknowledged as an historical,
probability. It would be interesting, indeed,
if it could be definitely proved that Free-
masons were direct descendants of the
Assassins. Nothing is more likely, Ave may
admit; yet direct proof would be a sensa-
tion of the highest order. The Assassins,
with the exception of the Druses, are the
best-known sect of the Middle East, and at
the time of the Crusades attained a most
unenviable notoriety. They Avere a Persian
branch of the Eastern Ismaeli. a dissentient
sect, belonging to the Scliiite Moslems. The
founder Avas Ilassan Ibn Mohammed as
Sabah. He studied under the Fatimite Cali-
phate at Cairo, and on the death of the
Caliph Mostanzer returned to Persia through
Syria, and there by stratagem obtained pos-
session of the fortress of Alamoot, the
“eagle’s nest,” set high in the mountains,
and from its position impregnable. That
was in A.n. 1090. Hassan, claiming that he
was the Huddjah. or Invisible Imaum, that
Messiah to which Islam looks bat Avho has
never come, obtained a number of followers
from the existing sects and founded his own
religion and order. He acquired with a vast
extension of his followers a number of other
castles, and eventually, in 1100, the Assas-
sins appeared officially in history. Hassan,
the Sheikh ul Jebal, the Old Man of the
Mountains, became the most formidable per-
son from Hindustan to the Atlantic. The
secret of Ilassan’s success was this. He
created an order, the basis of which was
loyalty tin to death to the head of the order,
himself. The reAvard of loyalty in this world
was promotion and authority, and in the
next world Paradise. The reward of dis-
loyalty was prompt dispatch to Gehenna. In
all respects the organisation of the Assassins
was the same as that of the Knights Tem-
plars. The Sheikh ul Jebal finds his coun-
terpart among the Templars in the Grand
Master: the three Dais al Kebir, Great Vice-
roys, correspond to the three Grand Priors:
the Dais or provincial master to the pro-
vincial Prior. Then come in each order the
Chaplains and the Knights, among the Assas-
sins called Lazek ; the Esquires correspond-
ing to the Fedavee, the actual death-dealers
among the Assassins; and. last of all, the
Serving Brethren. Avho, in both orders,
counted for quantity rather than quality.
The descendants of the Assassins to-day are
the Nusairi, though in parts of Persia the
original name, Ansairee, is still found. (Nu-
sairi is, indeed, an Arabic corruption of the
original Persian An-Nusaireeyah.)
One point which Mr. Springett’s book
suggests is that, with all these different
sects in the Middle East, there is less
danger of a Jehad or Holy War than might
appear from the European cables. Practi-
cally all the religions of those parts are
Moslem in origin, even the sun-worshippers
having got their original inspiration from
the Prophet. But the sects have little in
common beyond a general acknowledgment
of Allah. Although the Persians may say
that there is only one God, they are careful
to add, “and perhaps Mohammed is his pro-
phet,” which does not indicate whole-souled
belief in thb theory of Islam.
It would have been useful if the author
had provided a larger and better index, for
the range of the volume is such that the
value of his work is depreciated by the im-
possibility of finding references, and even
when they are to be found the page is often
wrongly given. In other respects, it is a
book to be recommended: it is not nearly
so stodgy as it looks and sounds, and it opens
up vast possibilities for those who read it
with a little imagination.
Labor from the Outside
Sir linden Macassey, a great civil servant,
who did excellent work in trying to pacify
Labor during the war, has written of his ex-
periences in Labor Policy ; False and True
(Thornton, Lutterworth and Co.).
He begins by stating the real policy of the
British Labor party so far as he has been
able to understand it. He has tried to state
that policy fairly, and has indulged in criti-
cisms, which are all the more severe because
they come from a friend. Next, he states
the labor policy of the late Government,
which, seeing that he helped to make it, was
no doubt as he says. In a third section he
gives his own views as to what Labor ought
to want. Few men appear to be able to escape
from the blighting effects of the “dismal
science” upon the English language. Pro-
fessor Stephen Leacock is almost the only
person who has written a readable boob,
on political economy, and that book was so
readable, so well written and so easily
understood that nobody seems to have taken
it seriously, though it still remains probably
the best book on the subject. But Macassey
is no Leacockj and sometimes his style
drags.
One gathers the impression that the Brit-
ish Labor party is composed of honest men
who are honestly trying to cure social ills,
and, despairing, have taken refuge in some
vague thing that they call “Socialisjn” ; but
what that thing is they do not know. There
are several varieties of Socialism, just as
there are several varieties of Christianity;
and every kind hates the others as bitterly
as so many clergymen. Each means so well;
each is so certain that it alone has dis-
covered the true happiness, the only cure for
widespread hunger. Yet, boiled down, it all
results in the old conclusion : “Be my brother,
or I will kill you.” For at the back of every
Socialist’s mind is the threat of violence and
revolution, though he may not know it.
There is not money enough in the world to
buy out the owners of “the means of pro-
duction,” etc., of which the unions talk ; and
if you cannot pay for the properties, what
else are you to do but kill their owners?
And, during the warv the workmen had
enough of their favorite “Nationalisation
with democratic control” to find that the
amorphous “State” is a worse employer
than the capitalist—harder, more stupid and
less sympathetic.
In the third section Macassey combats
Karl Marx, whose vague dreams he admits
are difficult to confute. You cannot argue
with the Marxians; you cannot find a com-
mon basis of argument. It is not that they
don’t admit that two and two make four;
the truth is rather that they don’t seem to
think it matters. The gospel according to
St. Marx must be accepted by faith—not by
reason ; and you cannot argue with a person
who believes by faith, especially when he
threatens to cut your throat if you do not
believe with him. Yet the “greatest . intel-
lectual mare’s nest of the past century,” as
Macassey says, must be reckoned with, for it
has taken a tenacious hold on the labor
unions. It Can no more be defeated by ridi-
cule than Christianity or Mohammedanism,
for it is held by faith —the faith of those
who are hungry. Macassey believes that the
only solution is to educate the masses in the
truth, and that much may be done by sym-
pathy and kindness between employer and
employed. That appears to be John Gals-
worthy’s view, to judge by “Foundations,”
and is probably the view of the best minds
to-day.
But Macassey does not even mention the
real argument against Socialism: that no
living species has enough food for every
individual to live comfortably. The real
enemy of the antelope is not the lion or the
wolf: it is the antelope feeding so peacefully
in the same field. The real enemy of a man
is not the tubercle bacillus or the spiro-
chaete; it is the comrade working at the
same bench. “But,” you say, “man has in-
telligence ; he is not as the beasts that
perish.” Quite so; man has intelligence
enough to perceive his real enemy, but not
enough to overcome the frightful law under
which all things have to live. Thus, if it
could possibly be arranged that to-morrow
every man on this earth would have enough
to eat, within a year there would come a
vast horde of invading babies for whom there
could be no sustenance once their mothers
had run dry. The pursuit of “enough” is
like that famous curve which is always
approaching a base-line, but can never meet
it; now it is an inch away, now lialf-an-
incli. then a quarter, an eighth, and so on.
Socialists oooh-pooh this argument and say
hard words about “biology,” Malthus,
Charles Darwin and the like; but they can-
not alter the truth, that creatures come into
the world which the world cannot possibly
support.
Nor does Macassey mention another de-
velopment, which has probably come since
the book was written. When I was in Italy
six months ago I saw many great meetings
of young men—serious, well-educated Uni-
versity graduates. These were Fas-
cists and were purposely anti-Marxian.

Society was defending itself against Maix,
and since then these young men, alter lull-
ing, have gone to the polls and returned a
Fascist Government under Mussolini, who
appears to be a pinchbeck Cromwell. Society
has met violence with violence, and, being
successful, is now returning to a settled and
law-abiding life. This Fascist movement has
to be reckoned with quite as much as its
Marxian opponent.

Alice Meynell
With the death of Alice Meynell, England
lost, without any doubt, her finest poetess.
Who is there among the women of to-day
to compete with her? I can think of
one only—that eerie genius Charlotte Mew,
whose laughter is so strange and savage
that it obscures her beauty to a great extent.
Dora Sigerson had a voice of thrilling poig-
nancy, but she sings no longer. .
There was a wonderful austerity m Mrs.
Meynell’s work which concealed, in the love
poems, a no less great passion. In her, heart
and intellect fuse into a harmony especially
rare among women. She did not sob her
way into one’s heart, as did Dora Sigerson,
nor was she strong-at-any-cost, like Emily
Bronte. She did not blush for her woman-
hood, but counted it her highest crown. Her
songs dealt with subjects intensely feminine
—motherhood, love, remembrance, religion.
Yet to her praise, she has never become the
heroine of suburban drawing-rooms.
She was the most accomplished of crafts-
women. Her poems are not merely airs
played on one string; they are intricately:
orchestrated symphonies. Perfect cadences
irise and fall with the spirit of her song, a
note trembles exquisitely and fades into a
perfect memory. Her poems are so highly-
wrought and form so perfect an entity that
it is difficult to cull examples. But no one
can miss the odor of such phrases as:
Ah, not more subtly silence strays,
and
Most dear pause in a mellow lay.
The words, meaningless though they be
apart from the context, lie caressingly upon
the tongue. One poem “Renouncement,”
however, stands pre-eminent. It was one of
the earliest of her poems, printed, if I mis-
take not, in the Observer in the good days
jiof Henley, and won prompt recognition for
her from Fiona McLeod, who placed it
among the three finest poems written by a
woman in English. It is too long to quote in
toto, too precious to break. But it is the
most perfect example of the passionate aus-
terity which is Mrs. Meynell’s chief virtue.
Other notable things are “To the Beloved,”
“At Night” and “Absence.” _
Mrs. Meynell had, too an important place
as a religious poet. She is of the company of
Catholics like Chesterton, Belloc and the
Irish writers, and some of her finest work is
done under religious inspiration. I love best
the poem “Soeur Monique,” written round a
rondeau of that name by Couperin—a per-
fect presentment of the physical and mental
being of some old saintly dame. “San
Lorenzo,” “The Lady Poverty, and “I am
the Way” are of the same immaculate con-
ception.
Her prose had the charm of her poetry,
and her essays are delicate companions for
solitude. But they are not good com-
panions for a railway journey. They must
be tasted carefully, and it is good to read
them aloud, if you are addicted to that vice.
Mrs. Meynell was a profound scholar of
mediaeval literature and history, and her
work dealing with Italy is of rare charm.
I read her “Ceres’ Runaway” only a few
days before the news of her death came.
It is a beautiful description of Nature’s
defiance of antiquity —how the spring grass
rejuvenates the unwilling Roman Forum
! .each year. Other essays, “The Towpath”
and “Wells,” have the fine flavor of an-
tiquity. “The Rhythm of Life” is a piece
: of rare and original philosophy. In her
historical works, she breaks a lance on
behalf of Madame Roland, a forgotten maker
of the French Revolution. In another book,
; “Hearts of Controversy,” she shows herself
an iluminating critic of the great figures of
literature. She was herself a connoisseur
or words, as her last book of collected essays,
“The Second Person Singular,” shows.
Poems of hers appeared in the last num-
ber of the London Mercery, so it seems that
she contrived to write till the day of her
death. Their beauty and strength had not
abated. The relationship of her family
with Francis Thompson is too well known
to require further comment, and she shall
write her own epitaph.
Oh, which are they that come through sweetest light
Of all these homing birds?
Which with the straightest and the swifcest flight?
Your words to me, your words !
G. A. COLLARD.
The European and His Traducer
Bay Webb, in his astonishing article on
“Celts and Teutons” (B. 9/11/’22), starts
by declaring that I ignore “the facts that
Goth, Teuton and Celt are all from the same
Asiatic stock.” Naturally I do so, as there
is not one shred of evidence to prove that
such is the case, and as there is very strong
evidence to the contrary. Their “legends,
thought-currents, archaeology” and the rest
differ at every point and differ to such an
extent that the Teuton person—including
many English types—is quite unable to
understand either the folk-lore or the spirit
of the Celt. Bay Webb appears to have
formed his ideas from some text-book, ex-
pressing the views generally held about
1850, but long since given up as absurd.
There are very few students left who believe
in the Asiatic origin of the European race.
That misconception was chiefly based upon
the assumption that Sanskrit was the oldest
of Indo-European languages, but when it
was discovered that Lithuanian was struc-
turally much older than Sanskrit, the whole
field had to be reviewed; and it is now toler-
ably evident that in remote times European
conquerors invaded India and Persia, leav-
ing their language there as a memorial of
their occupation, but that the actual race-
home was in Europe. Similarly, it is clear
that the forests of Germany were peopled by
a fair-haired savage race, very low in the
civilised scale, who acquired the language
of a higher social life from their more
advanced neighbors, and thus appeared to be
of Indo-European descent, from the evidence
of language alone. This is, of course, dis-
puted by German ethnologists; but a reason-
able survey of the archaeological ground as
well as of the history and characteristics of
the peoples makes it tolerably certain.
Bay Webb assures us that the Scandina-
yian sagas and the Hibernian legends are
‘‘appeals to the same traits of character.”
This statement is so magnificently ridiculous
that I can only advise its writer to read
some of the sagas and legends referred to.
Unless he brings a heavy, wooden Teutonic
mind to his reading, he will be forced to
admit that no two sets of legends differ more
widely in their appeal. In point of fact, a
single evening’s reading should convince him
of the absurdity of his whole contention.
As to the evidence of Julius Caesar, which
is advanced with such a bland simplicity, it
must surely be clear to anyone who has the
remotest knowledge of the facts that Julius
had very little more information about the
ancient Britons than Bay Webb himself.
Julius had to furnish some sort of reason for
his invasion and made out a case which would
fit in with the gossip of the time. Britain
was an unknown world; and a tale of
painted savages went down well. As against
his story, archaeologists have proved that
Britain, before the Roman period, was the
home and centre of the art of enamelling on
metal. Here is a passage from the “Pro-
ceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland” :
The Gauls as well as the Britons —of the same
Celtic stock —practised enamel-working before the
Roman conquest. The enamel workshops of Bibracte,
with their furnaces, crucibles, moulds, polishing-
stones, and with the crude enamels in various stages
of preparation, have been recently excavated from the
ruins of the city destroyed by Caesar and his legions.
But the Bibracte enamels are the work of mere dab-
blers in the art, compared with the British examples.
The home of the art was Britain, and the style of
the pattern, as well as the association in which the
objects decorated with it were found, demonstrated
the certainty that it had reached its highest stage of
indigenous development before it came into contaot
with the Roman culture.
But Julius represented the people who
possessed such arts as savages—painted sav-
ages, some of them. What, then, is his word
on any matter connected with the Britons
worth? We know that they fought too well
to please him, and that he was glad to leave
them alone; and that is about the only point
in the Caesarian narrative worth noting.
Further, there are evidences of Teutonic
penetration into Britain several centuries
before the Christian era; and while the arts
are Celtic and link up with those of Gaul
and Ireland, Caesar may have picked out the
bad habits of the Teutonic part of the popu-
lation to make his own savage attack look
the more justifiable.
Bay Webb asks some questions; let me
counter them with some others. He asks:
“If the mere tribesman stood on equal foot-
in" with the greatest of Celtic kings, where
did the Druids find victims for their sacri-
ficial fires?” My answer is, Were there any
such sacrificial fires? There is no trace of
them in legend and no proof of them from
archaeology. He asks: “If the Celt acknow-
ledged no private ownership in land, how
could Diarmid of Leinster contract to re-
ward Strongbow and his adventurers with
Irish land?” Here are some other ques-
tions: (lj Where is the proof of the com
tract? (2) Can Bill Sikes not divide his
plunder with a pal because there is law
against theft?
In his last paragraph, however, Bay Webb
makes a statement which amounts to nothing
less than a criminal libel on the European
race. He says, “the Hindoo and Briton are
alike descendants of the same peoples of
Persia.” This is, no doubt, the malice of
ignorance; but it calls for the strongest con-
demnation. There is hot a shadow of ground
ethnological, etymological, archaeological or
historical for a belief that Britons have any
such descent. That peoples remotely related
to their remote ancestors went into Persia
and India is true. It is also true that the
highest caste of India claims a descent from
those very remote relatives of very remote
ancestors. But the attempt to show that
there is blood kinship between the brown
man of India and the white man of Eng-
land is not merely futile —it is malicious.
Finally, Bay Webb voices a very dull,
falsehood: “A man is the child of liis en-
vironment, and not an echo nf the thinkings
of remote ancestors.” Which is 'exactly
equal to a declaration that the negroes of.
the United States are white men in all but
color, and that people born of Chinese
parents in Sydney have exactly the same
traits of character as those descended from
a long line of Scottish Presbyterian parsons.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Another Millennial Recipe
Social reformers in Great Britain to-
day are as numerous as the sands of the
shore, and perhaps out of the multitude of
remedies which they offer relief may come.
Unfortunately, they are like the enthusiasts
of Hudibras, and have not the slightest be-
lief or even sympathy with the remedies of
their rivals. J. A. Hobson, author of The
Economics of Unemployment (George Allen
and Unwin), has been in the British Labor
movement for some 20 years, and should have
plenty of experience in putting a case, but
unfortunately he is a cobbler who cannot
stick to his last. I first made his acquaint-
ance when he was sympathising with the
Finns in the days when Russia was sup-
posed to be tyrannising over them. He was
then a Fabian. Later, I found him deep in
the toils of Guild Socialism, whilst what he
is now it would be hard to say from the
contents of the present volume, except that
he is a devoted enemy of the Douglas Theory
of Credit, to the criticism of which he de-
votes quite a lot of space.
His book is an effort to prove that indus-
trial depression is not due to cyclical periods
of good and bad trade, nor even, to any
great extent, to the after-effects _of a bad
war and a worse peace, but primarily is
the result of the uneven distribution of in-
come. A more equable distribution of in-
come, he says, would result in “fuller, more
regular and more productive activity
throughout the economic system.” The
theory is based on the existence of a limited
market, and he argues that many markets
are limited by producers with the deliberate
intention of raising prices, decreasing costs
and without regard to the constancy of em-
ployment. There is no small basis of fact
for the assertion, though probably the author
goes too far when he complains that Imperi-
alism is a direct result of this desire to limit
consumption. The facts here do not fit in
with the theory. It is also theoretically true
that if everybody had a fixed income the
consumption of goods would be more con-
stant, and production of goods, and with it
employment, would fluctuate less.
The difficulty, however, is to get at that
more equable distribution of income, the de-
sirability of which may be acknowledged.
The more money in circulation the greater
the demand for goods; but care must be
taken that spending does not over-ride sav-
ing, for it is out of . the savings of income
that industry is financed, and what employment
there is maintained and increased. How
this equalisation is to be accomplished Mr.
Hobson does not say. He throws out a
vague suggestion on the last page that it
may be achieved by a “mixed policy of prime
monopolies, control of profits, prices and
conditions of employment, and a tax sys-
tem whereby society secures for beneficial
public services the idle elements of income
which do not nourish or evoke productive
effort,” but this salad of words tells us little.
That is the trouble with most of the intel-
lectual doctrinaires of the socialist move-
ment. They can spin words by the ream,
but to give’ thought to their words and co-
herence to their thoughts appears to be be-
yond most of them.

A Satchel of Books
A Kipling Anthology (Prose). The latest volume
of Macmillan and Co.’s blue-covered Dominions edi-
tion of Kipling. A handy little book of extracts,
sanely selected and well printed, with comfortably
wide spacing.
Among .the scholastio annuals now making their
appearance, Manly, the organ of the R.C. College at
Manly (N.S.W.) is a dreadnought—27o pages of
prose, verse and illustrations. Another excellent pro-
duction is Newman, the magazine of the Students’
Club of Newman College, Melb. ’Varsity. Here, too,
the editor has made a good selection of literary
articles, and has unearthed a promising versifier
or two.
The Radio Pathfinder, by Richard 11. Ranger (Heine-
mann). A most ingeniously sugar-coated pill of
knowledge. The author, in the breeziest fashion, re-
solves the mysteries of wireless for the layman, and
so equips the beginner that he can embark upon his
first “set” with confidence. And the points made by
the letterpress are rammed home by a series of draw-
ings by Thomas E. Monroe, who proves that humor
and technicalities can be joyously blended.
The Art of Sara Levi (Edward A. Vidler, Melb.).
Reproductions in color of a dozen pictures by a Mel-
bourne adventurer in paint. The artistic value of
the lady’s work neither measures up to the preten-
tiousness of the volume or down to the stodginess of
the monograph therein. “Though her art has never
attained the highest measure of technical achievement
it has never fallen below the standard of good taste
and cultured appropriateness she has set herself” is
one. of the gems of the latter effort.
Robert A. Hamblin has written better books than
The Eyes of Innocence (George Allen and Unwin).
He has some reputation as a humorist, but he will
have to do better than this to maintain it, for
what humor there is is forced, whilst the character-
isation is poor in the extreme. The inefficiency of
Government offices has long been overdone as a source
of amusement. As for the love interest, it begins
with an isosceles triangle on page 63, and is then
dropped until the penultimate page, when Adeline
and Ben meet in a school of languages in Pans.
Merton of the Movies, by Harry Leon Wilson. The
author of “Ma Pettengill,” “Buggies of Bed Gap”
and other popular sellers, breaks new ground with
the story of a failure that spelt success. Merton Gill
is a shop-assistant who aspires to high art on the
screen. He throws up his job and goes west to Cali-
fornia. The best he can do is, thanks to a
striking likeness, a bad imitation of an actor as bad,
or perhaps worse. Despising comedy, he becomes, by
reason of his colossal vanity, a comic star, though
the cinema Boss has to lead a life of deception to
get the comic results out of this Sancho Panza of
the films. A thoroughly good story with an unex-
pected love interest at the end. (From Dymock’s.)
The Van Roon, by J. C. Snaith. There is no doubt
that the writer is an accomplished craftsman, with
great versatility in both subjects and handling, ‘ the
Van Boon,” the story of a picture, is like nothing
else the author has written. It is a straightforward
yarn of the finding of a rare and valuable Old
Master by the assistant at an antique shop, and of
how his 'master tries to swindle him out of it, and
how the old man’s niece saves the picture. Ihe
character-sketching is excellent. The simplicity of
William, the assistant, the avarice of Old Uncle bi,
and the insight and perseverance of -Tune are splen-
didly done. It is a very human story, which includes,
too, no small amount of picture-lore. (Our copy
from Dymock’s.)
The Vanishing Point, by Coningsby Dawson
(Hutchinson). Varensky, one of the characters in
this yarn, seems to be an amiable and well-meaning
caricature of Kerensky, who, after the abdication
of the Czar, tried to make Bussia safe from
democracy. Another person in the book, Santa
Gorlof, who has all the exasperating mysteriousness
and unparalleled beauty of a William Le Queux hero-
ine, appears to have been suggested to the author by
a notorious dancer who was shot as a German spy
in Paris during the war. But the tale in which
they figure is unreasonably sensational. It is leaity
a kinemotional disturbance that would do much
better on the films.
It’s All in the Game, by W. M. Tilden (Methuen).
Several feeble short stories on tennis subjects by
the world’s acknowledged master of the game.
Tilden is no writer, and his descriptions of allegedly
sensational matches are appalling in their dulness.
The interest of the tales to Australians, however, lies
in the artless introduction of our two champions
transparently disguised as Brokaw and Paliperson.
Tilden refers to Brokaw as the “wizard,” blit Pal-
merson is a “crude” player who is liable to blow
up ” Incidentally, Tilden mentions how Palmerson s
service is shattered by a young American White
Hope who stands well up to the ball .and halt-
volleys it back into play. Brookes did this with
the Yankee “blizzard,” McLoughlin, over 10 years
ago, but Tilden has shown no disposition to deal with
Patterson in the same way.
Soliloquy, by Stephen McKenna (Hutchinsoh),
provides 287 pages of monologue by Marion Shelley
on her life and adventures as a woman of fashion
after a staid careeer as the daughter of an Oxford
professor. The old gentleman is the most amiable
character in the book, whereas Marion is almost as
artificial as the crowd of idlers who come to pick
the bones of family skeletons at her tremendous
supper tables. Apparently she quite callously drops
a young man with a future for a whisky-sodden
celebrity whose position promises her more social
limelight, but it is hard to reconcile the coolness of
this proceeding with her emotional stress as a middle-
aged kidnapper trying to “vamp” the son of her
former lover. Marion has been a brilliant lecreation
for the author, but she is a showy little person who
grows tiresomely sententious and considers a scene
well won with an epigram. However, many people
will be able to bear with her for the sake of the
pictures of the British upper middle-class at its
meals and 6ther devotions.

When China, to a sound of tinkling jade,
Moved with slow step along the quiet
years.
Dreaming great dreams, while yet the
breaking spears
Answered the hollow brass of those who
made
Red harvest of the corn, some gardener laid
A seed in sun-sweet earth. About his ears
Was mist of music, as when Spring’s fine
tears
Beat the thin rice-drums homeward, blade
by blade.
Magic had called the bees of Heaven to wed
The flowers of slumber to the morning air;
And from the seed arose the mystic vine,
More tender than the whisper of the dead
That sings a silence, yet is everywhere
Tingling to thought within the poet’s
line.

After Midnight: North Head.
The little boat is rocked upon
Great Ocean’s bosom. Drifting high.
Scarce-visible clouds join Life and Death
In a stupendous lullaby.
A slender thread of moon that hangs
In the vague sky is fast asleep.
I hear the hush dream to the lilt
Of music stirring in the deep.
Deep is the sky in all its reach,
Depth on dim depth from east to west,
Deep as our hope that will not die,
Deep as God’s mercy faintly guessed.
With slithery flop a dolphin flies
On its strange business, God knows where.
Far overhead a gull’s thin plaint
Flicks like a sliver through the air.
The fish are safe from me just now.
Oblivious all of sprat and shark,
I let my doubtings drift away
And sit contented in the dark.
Here Nature’s lullaby makes peace
Triumphant over pain and strife,
And keeps me equally in love
With grief and joy and Death and Life.

To death divinely sweet through the blue
glow
Of summ’ry seas in swoon . .
To the impassioned Australasian skies
At your sun-sandalled feet.

Child Death.
A laugh has gone; and an emptiness
Is in our hearts, and leaves them chill.
Oh, that little form in its strange, white
dress
That lies so still!
Round a face so white her tresses lie;
The laughing dimples all are fled;
Where sunshine smiled in her eager eye
The light is dead.
A laugh is gone, like a sunray slain
By a heavy cloud in a darkened hour;
Yet take the thoughts that are not all pain
For this dead flower.
She knew no pain, and she knew no wrong;
Hers was the life of wonder furled
In the budding flowers —the happy song
Of a young, sweet world.
Sorrow is ours; but we have had
The joy of her in the short sweet day
Of her happy life, and a memory glad
Must with us stay.
The tears must fall; but jn future hours
Flowers she loved will her soft couch gem,
And she, in her sleep, ’neath the mantled
flowers
May dream of them.

A CONFUSED AND INCONCLUSIVE
AFFAIR.
In a novel, the name of which the writer
forgets, but it had a strangled woman in it,
and it also contained a dead body that wan-
dered about in a cab on a hot day, the great
detective told his amateur brother that,
apart from having missed every point that
mattered, his diagnosis of the case was mas-
terly. Similarly, the recent electoral dis-
turbance in Australia has crawled to its
troubled finish, with all parties missing
almost every essential point. For once
there was no referendum about the enlarge-
ment of the powers of the Commonwealth,
though there was a golden opportunity to
take the popular opinion as to giving the Aus-
tralian Parliament authority to subdivide the
dropsical States. At one time or another
almost everybody told everything he knew
and many things he didn’t know about almost
everybody else. It was stated very clearly
that those in power had muddled or neglected
most, things; and that those immediately
before them were the same, only worse; while
there was every probability that those likely
to come after them would be even more in-
famous. Yet, though the air was. dark with
innuendoes, threats and insults, a lack of
definiteness pervaded the scene as a whole
* * * •*
Nobody dragged from anybody else the
balance-sheet of that great mystery, the Com-
monwealth Shipping Line. An obvious way
to treat it and similar suspicious secrets,
such as the N. S. Wales State dock at Walsh
Island, the accounts of which are also buried,
is to give the Auditor-General ( State or
Federal) power, not only to report on the
accounts that are presented to him, but to
go round like a pirate horde and seize on
accounts that are not presented. This
would be hateful to nearly every party, but
it should be the Auditor-General’s duty to
do it, and he should nave authority. to sus-
pend persons who refuse to produce’ figures,
and otherwise to make them sit up. He
might, perhaps, even audit testimonials given
to Ministers. The Government promised-to
put the murky shipping line under a board,
which is quite different from putting it under
the public gaze. A board, being opaque, may
even increase the obscurity. It didn t say
what the board would be under, but it
promised (or was understood to promise)
that when the ships now under construction
in Australia are finished, no more will be
started. In that case, Australian ship-
building is a failure under the present man-
agement, and the Commonwealth fleet should
be sold before it degenerates, for lack of re-
inforcement, into a collection of arks and
antiques. The Opposition said that the ves-
sels now under construction will cost over
a , million each, and be worth only about
£300,000, and everybody said this was very
probable and hardly worth mentioning. But
it didn’t propose to reduce wages, lengthen
hours or demand more work, so as to get
cheaper ships, nor did it suggest getting rid
of the whole business. Other big questions
straggled along in the same unfinished man-
ner. If anybody apart from Austin Chap-
man takes seriously the misplaced Federal
Capital in Two Pieces, 140 Miles Asunder,
which was born of lying and breach of faith,
it seems that the money required to make it
fit for habitation might as well be spent now
as any other day. But no party had the
decisiveness to put on its programme either
that Dryberra should be finished and estab-
lished next year, or that it should be sold
next month for what it would fetch. The
baby bonus was left in a corresponding state
of suspended animation. No one believes in
it, but uo one was quite sure how a proposal
for its abolition would be taken, and every-
body waited for the other fellow to bell the
cat.
* * * *
In fact, but for Piddington’s last-minute
disclosures about his opponent’s High Court
manoeuvres, and but for Hughes’s £25,000 tes-
timonial, the election would have been flat,
like the Old Man Plain, but not so spacious.
Phere were either seven or seventeen parties.
One of them realised that Australia wants
tar more States and State capitals, it bemg
the ill-luck of the country that it accurnu-
fates population round capitals and nowhere
else. Ihe other six or sixteen held that it was
easier to wait another 60 years or so, and see
it anything might turn up—a worm, perhaps,
or maybe a fresh comet. Then one party
suggested that the four years’ industrial
deadlock in the Northern Territory should
be dealt with by giving the place a speaking
but not a voting member in the House of
iteps. ihere was very little enthusiasm
about an M.P. with no vote to swap with
brother log-rollers. The transcontinental
railway question was handled almost exclu-
sively by the S. Australian candidates.
Others skirted it as if it were a dangerous
promontory. It is a pioneering or colonis-
ing and defensive work to which Australia’s
honor is pledged, but which is to run through
a country with few votes at present, and
another with no votes at all. It has been
hung up for years because two States with
plenty of votes to sell want it deviated through
their flattest and most barren parts, thus
taking a longer route and avoiding the one
region with a rainfall and some real rivers
that Central Australia can show. Between
a cast-iron obligation and the obvious inter-
ests of the country on one side, and the solid
voting strength of two big States on the
other, this question resembles the quilly
porcupine. The uniform railway gauge
hardly got a mention. It was fairly
well agreed that, somewhere and somehow, a
vast amount of hard-borrowed money had
dropped through some sort of a hole in the
tangled struggle to settle Australian ex-
service men on “the land.” It was
generally decided to throw' the blame
on the States, which had “fooled away
the Commonwealth’s money”—just as if
everybody’s money isn’t liable to be fooled
away unless watched. As water spilled on
the sand can’t be gathered up, no matter
how the owners recriminate, this matter
should be one of the live future rather than
the eorpsed past, and an obvious course
would be to charge the losses against revenue
on the instalment plan instead of leaving
them for posterity to carry. The effort of
payment might keep the community awake,
which is a desirable _ condition, seeing that
the settlement of British ex-service men here
on a large scale is mooted. This view,
seemingly, didn’t strike any candidate hard
enough to make a dent.
* * * *
Something, but not so much as might have
been expected, was said abou-t the advisa-
bility of establishing uniform bankruptcy,
marriage, divorce and other statutes to miti-
gate the law’s delays and also the law’s
expenses, and there were tentative references
to defence, the need for economy, and the
beauties of reduced taxation. However, as
the end drew nigh everything blended into a
dull, unceasing roar of accus- Tt was
charged against Hughes that Japanese were
among the subscribers to his £25,000, and
at this last aspersion his strong heart —the
same which had stood up so bravely to the
suggestion that the testimonial was the work
of the trusts —broke utterly, and he issued
a £lO,OOO writ against the Sydney Daily
Mail and a criminal libel writ against a
member of its staff. Also—it being, now,
the election morn—he cried in the columns
of the ever-complaisant Telegraph :
An advertisement of the Labor Party referring to
these charges is signed by five persons— Dwyer
Lambert, Power, Carey, O’Dea— -all Catholics. ’
The whole thing is an attempt by a certain section
in the community who have been and still are my
implacable enemies to swing public opinion.
He then charged Piddington with being a
potential ally of the Bolsheviks, Barwell with
being a Black Australian, Watt with being
a “tool” and Earle Page with being a
dud ; and all replied with further embit-
tered references to his £25,000, and to his
conduct in trying to pack the High Court
in the interests of his party programme.
Practically every known offence was at
this stage being charged against everyone
by everybody, except that of robbing a poor
Siamese widow of her one ewe-elephant.
Most people extracted enjoyment out of this
final flutter, for Australians, with some
£40,000,000 of new loan money per annum
to help them along, can afford to postpone
problems that other folk might regard as
serious. Of course this won’t be always so.
It is on record that when Abdul-Hamid was
in his last fine frenzy rolling, many young
Turkish gentlemen fled for safety and
formed a colony in Paris, taking the most
valuable of their female human live-stock
with them. These ladies, accustomed to the
narrow limits of the harem and the support
of slaves and eunuchs, could only toddle like
infants or fall down like them, and Paris
found harmless amusement in watching them
learn, of necessity, to walk. The spectacle
of Australia learning to walk may also make
a pleasing show one of these days.
THE APPLICATION OF STUART
METHODS TO MODERN GOVERN-
MENT.
The charge levelled by A. B. Piddington
against W. M. Hughes, in the closing stages
of the North Sydney contest, should, if the
meaning of it had been generally appreci-
ated, have caused the Prime Minister, at
the very least, to lose his deposit. It
meant that Mr. Hughes, almost as soon as
his party had gained office, started out to
pack the High Court Bench for political pur-
poses. But, apparently, the electors did
not grasp the point, and its implications; and
perhaps they are not to be blamed, inasmuch
as even those newspapers which arrogate to
themselves the duty of guiding public opinion
when elections are raging, were in the same
boat. Thus the SUN came out on the day
of the exposure with this monumental ex-
ample of ineptitude:—
Into the serene and pure atmosphere of the High
Court Bench no suggestion of political influences
must be permitted to intrude. Every politician,
as every human being, has made mistakes.
The Prime Minister, in seeking the best man for
the most responsible judicial position in the Common-
wealth, had the duty to scrutinise the personal
character of all possible candidates. Mr. Hughes
was justified in attempting to find out whether the
man he had in his eyes was a broad or a narrow
constitutionalist, whether he was free from legal or
political bias.
He went the wrong way about it.
* * * *
Our High Court, like the U.S. Supreme
Court, is inevitably a constant source of
interest to party politicians. It is a matter
of the Federal system, which, in Dicey’s
phrase, “substitutes litigation for legisla-
tion.” The High Court —that “small oli-
garchy of non-elected, irremovable Judges in
a democracy”—is in a position to veto the
desires of Parliament, as expressed in laws
passed by both Houses. In Deakin’s time
the Protectionist and Labor parties, acting
together, put a mass of industrial and eco-
nomic legislation of an advanced nature on
the Federal Statute Book. First came the
Trade Marks Act, which was designed to
give a preference to union-made goods. The
Excise Tariff Act followed. The idea here
was that operatives should be paid wages pro-
portioned by the tariff assistance given to the
industry employing them. And, finally, the
Australian Industries Preservation Act, which
was directed against injurious monopolies,
materialised. One of the most fervent sup-
porters of these measures was W. M.
Hughes. The High Court consisted, at the
time, of three narrow constitutionalists
(Griffith, Barton and O’Connor) and
two broad ones (Isaacs and Higgins), and
when the narrow majority declared the Acts
invalid the cries of protest set up by
Hughes were deafening. His complaints,
however, were futile; and he knew it.
Nothing but the death or hopeless ill-
ness of one of the narrow Judges was
capable of giving life and vigor to the
schemes which meant so much to his ambi-
tions. With the retirement or decease of
an obstructionist there might, of course,
be a reversal of the Court’s decisions;
for the successor of the departed might inter-
pret the Constitution on different lines.
There was a death, and that was where Pid-
dington—-then in England, and reputed by
some of his friends to be a broad constitu-
tionalist—came into the business. The Gov-
ernment’s duty was to choose the best man,
irrespective of his possibilities in the political
line. What Hughes did, on all the evi-
dence, was to look to the other side of the
world for a Judge, not because he considered
the object of his attention to be the ideal man
for the position, but for the reason that this
particular Iv.C. gave promise of being a
pliant political tool.
* * *
Mr. Hughes has given his accuser the lie
direct on this issue. It is a way he has in
controversy. But existing documents refute
him. This is an extract from one of his
letters to Mr. Piddington’s brother-in-law :
I want you to cable Piddington and find out what
his views are on Commonwealth v. State Rights.
The matter is at once very urgent and very import-
ant. I’ll tell you what it is, I want to put Pidding-
ton on the High Court Bench. But before doing so
I must be satisfied that he is not a rabid States
Right champion. I should never be forgiven if I
was responsible for such an act as that.
Piddington was on his way to Australia
from England; and at Port Said he
got a cable from his brother-in-law:
“Most important know your views Com-
monwealth versus State Rights.” He
replied: “In sympathy with supremacy
of Commonwealth powers.” At Colombo
he received the formal offer of the
Judgeship, but cabled: “If with complete
independence validity questions shall accept.
Do not hesitate withdraw offer if you wish.”
Hughes did not wish, having found out all
he wanted to know. Piddington’s conscience
troubled him, and he consulted Edmund
Barton and the present Chief Justice of
N. S. Wales. They seem to have urged him
to carry on; Barton, anyhow, wrote to a
friend: “There are those who will say that
he [Piddington] could have served his
country better by keeping his high appoint-
ment, and these will, or may, say that his
action is quixotic.” However, Piddington
resigned and Hughes turned elsewhere.
Two disastrous results have accrued from
the imbecile conduct of the Hughesites in
publicly taunting Piddington about his re-
tirement, until he had no option between
revealing the truth and sitting down under
an imputation on his personal honor. The
first has been to throw a cloud over the
High Court as at present constituted. The
original High Court —the Bench to which
Mr. Hughes took such frequent and bitter
exception in the days when he was a Labor-
ite —delivered a long series of judgments by
which the Federal Arbitration Court was
precluded from interfering with the instru-
mentalities of the States. The present High
Court was appointed, in part at least, dur-
ing the consulship of that Caesar who nine
years ago required assurances that Mr. Pid-
dington was the right political color as a
condition precedent to putting him on the
bench. In June of last year it delivered
judgment in the A.S.E. case —a decision
which the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council refused, a few days back, to disturb.
In doing so it took a step which Chief-
Justice Griffith had denied (Huddart-
Parker v. Moreiiead) its competence to
take: it over-ruled itself. Its decision gave
the State employees, including 50,000 rail-
way servants, what Griffith, Barton and
O’Connor had refused them, what the elec-
tors had withheld from them by referendum,
what W. M. Hughes bad struggled unavail-
ingly for 15 years to give them—access to,
and control by the Federal Arbitration
Court. The probable conclusion of all that
section of the community which is opposed
to constitutionalism, and eager to overthrow
existing institutions, is likely to be that the
Judges who caused the High Court to re-
verse itself were put there by Mr. Hughes
on the understanding that they would do
that very thing. Those who know them will
not believe it, but unfortunately for the pres-
tige of these eminent men their personal
acquaintances represent only a limited class.
It needs no great acumen to realise what an
encouragment to revolution must be repre-
sented by the fostering of this idea, that the
Prime Minister —one who, in his own phrase,
is “the entire outfit” in the Federal sphere
—is in a position to rig, and capable of
rigging, the highest court in the land. It
takes us back three centuries—to the days,
anpropriately enough, of “benevolences” and
the sale of knighthoods. Before the first
decade of the 17th century ended James I.
had made both Houses of Parliament his
creatures. Only the courts remained to be
overcome. The principle which James
sought to establish was the identical one
which Hughes attempted to impose on Pid-
dington—that the repository of the prero-
gative must know how judgments on big
issues were going before they were delivered.
The only public man of James’s reign
who had the courage to stand up to him in
this connection was Coke, the Chief Justice.
Coke was dismissed from his office as an en-
couragement to the others. The whole his-
tory of the system, which forms the basis
of our freedom, from the days of the Jus-
ticiars, nearlv a thousand years ago. down to
modern times, has been one long struggle to
keep the bench absolutely independent of the
executive. It has remained for Mr.
Hughes, the Empire’s friend, democracy’s
sea-green incorruptible, to make a move
liable to be fatal to both Empire and de-
mocracy, with the object of scoring a party
triumph. If the Commonwealth ever again
allows such a man to be its “whole outfit” it
will deserve the disaster which is likely to
overtake it.
TOUCHING THE HONOR OF TWO
PROFESSIONS.
Two years and four months ago the N. S.
Wales Full Court (Cullen, C.J., Ferguson,
J., and Wade, J.) considered the case of an
erring Sydney solicitor. He had acted for
a client in an infringement of copyright
matter, and had been ordered, by decree,
to hand over certain films. A third party
held a lien over the films, and, evidently with
the object of safeguarding this person’s
rights, letters were dictated by the solicitor,
and ante-dated afterwards by someone else.
The complaint of those authorities who are
charged with maintaining the reputation of
the lower branch of the legal profession in an
unblemished state was that these letters
might have been used as evidence to excuse
non-performance of the decree, and that
thereby the Court might have been misled.
In point of fact, the letters were not used,
and so the Court -was not misled. It
was felt, however, by both Bench and Law
Institute, that the mere gesture was culpable,
and the attorney was suspended for six
months. In the course of a lengthy judg-
ment the Chief Justice delivered himself of
these elevating sentiments :
Now it had more than once been pointed out
that in the case of solicitors who, as officers of the
Court, were entrusted with exclusive privileges in
connection with the business of clients, it was not
unreasonable to exact that standard of straight-
forwardness and honorable dealing which the public
had a right to expect from them, and which, in the
vast majority of cases, was conformed to by the
members of this honorable profession. He did not
wish to use harsh terms in describing the mischief
calculated to be caused b : y any lowering of the
standard. But he did not think the Court would
be justified in passing this case over with a mere
censure. If something more were not done it would
amount to an intimation to junior members of the
profession that, even in the case of an experienced
solicitor, such an act would be regarded as a com-
paratively venial offence.
The subject of this rebuke, while not actu-
ally a junior, was one of the younger genera-
tion of attorneys ; he had no partners to turn
to for advice; and he was not a member of
those clubs to which most of the Judges
belong. These handicaps in respect of the
attainment of the very highest standard of
professional ethics do not appear to have
been taken into account by the Court. Still,
on the whole, the public was delighted with
its stark attitude. An uneasy impression has
existed for some time in N. S. Wales that
there is too much laxity for the safety of
laymen where irregularities in some of the
professions are concerned ; and that this may-
be a matter sometimes of the frailer members
and those who are called to sit in judgment
on them being all friends together, it were.
Naturally, anything that tends to dispel such
suspicions is greeted with relief. Judge, then,
the puzzled disappointment of the public—
that public which, as an outcome of the 1920
case above referred to, had been led to believe
that solicitors, anyhow, feel stains on the
honor of their calling like wounds—at the
official silence which has so far greeted the
allegations made over and over again during
the Gordon Bray bankruptcy proceedings.


Dr. BII4Y has sworn each time he has faced
the Registrar: —
(1) That his wife originally named three co-
respondents in her divorce suit against him.
(2) That her solicitor demanded £3OO costs ior
himself, and £ls a week alimony for her, to with-
draw two of these ladies from the petition.
(3) That the solicitor who was acting for him
(Bray) urged him to agree to pay the money, though
his family solicitor “advised him to have nothing
whatever to do with it.” ,
(4) That eventually he yielded, and signed an
agreement to pay, whereupon the names of the _ two
co-respondents were withdrawn and a new petition
filed.
* * * *
The situation bristles with conflicting
possibilities. In the first place the doctor’s
statements may be incorrect in some particu-
lars, or in all. He probably knows little of
law, and so may have been drawn into error
in good faith. Again, it is not beyond the
bounds of imagination that he may be mak-
ing the case against the solicitors as black
as possible: rightly or wrongly, he appears to
associate some of them with his financial
troubles. Assume next that he has told the
truth, wholly or in part. In that event there
must be documentary evidence on the sub-
ject—evidence which the Official ■ Assignee
could get without the slightest, difficulty. If
Dr. Bray has no evidence, if it can be
shown by the firms he has named that his
allegations are baseless, then surely he has
been guilty of conduct calling for punish-
ment by the B.M.A. It is hard to conceive
a more detestable deed on the part of a doc-
tor than that of hurling aspersions from
the witness-box at innocent men, who, like
himself, are chartered servants of the public,
and whose reputations for candor and
straight dealing form an essential part of
their professional stock-in-trade. But, if he
has told the truth, what then? The solicitor
who appeared before the Full Court 28
months ago was punished not because he
had made, or tried to make, one farthing by
dishonest means (lie had not), not because
be had actually misled the Court (he had
not), but, in the Chief Justice’s words, be-
cause, if his slip were overlooked, “it would
amount to an intimation to junior members
of the profession that even in the case of an
experienced solicitor such an act would be
regarded as a comparatively venial offence.”
Undoubtedly this attorney did wrong, if only
in a technical sense. But contrast his mis-
deed with what is claimed to have happened
in the Bray business. Here, • according to
the story told to the Registrar, the bankrupt
was advised by his family solicitor (one of
the members, by the way, of the governing
body of the Law Institute) “to have nothing
whatever to do with it”—that is, with the
scheme to dismiss two of the co-respondents
from the suit ou condition certain money
payments were made or promised. The
solicitor in question does not seem to have
contradicted Dr. Bray on this point, and
the advice he is said to have given was cer-
tainly that which a reputable lawyer might
be expected to provide. It would be pernici-
ous and dangerous to the last degree if attor-
neys were to be allowed to arrogate to them-
selves the right to put people out of divorce
suits in this way. If it is established offici-
ally that guilty co-respondents can be dis-
missed from suits, behind the Court’s back,
by means of money-settlements, then the
only Lotharios who will have future cause
to fear the loss of their reputations in the
Divorce Court will be the indigent ones. And
if innocent co-respondents are to be put into
suits and taken out again on condition
that money is paid (also behind the Court’s
back), then a new industry will presently
arise—that of naming wealthy respondents
and co-respondents with the object of fleec-
ing them. How lucrative this trade might
be made may be deduced from the fact that
in two successive Adelaide suits, not very
long- ago, (1) a respondent had to pay
£II,OOO in costs, and (2) a co-respondent is
said to have announced that he “would get
out of the scandal with a clear name if it
cost him £30,000.”

The solicitors implicated in the Bray
matter are older and more experienced than
the relatively unimportant sole attorney
who, a couple of years ago, was punished so
severely for dictating, behind the back of the
Court, letters which, if used, might have
been misleading. They are members of
important firms, bearers of well-known
names. If they are innocent, steps should
be taken to make the thing clear in the
only way it can be made clear, firstly, and
above all, in order that no suspicion .of
favoritism may rest upon those in high
places; secondly, for the peace of mind of
those who may one day have to figure as
respondents or co-respondents; and, finally,
in the interests of the solicitors themselves
and of their profession. The very eminence
which they have attained makes it all the
more imperative that they should be vindi-
cated. There remains the incredible alterna-
tive that nothing will be done at all. There
has been ample political precedent of late
for a cheerful indifference to the most
hair-raising charges. The accusation
made last week by A. B. Piddington—
that the Prime Minister had tried to
pack the High Court bench —would have
stirred up a hurricane of scandalised protest
amongst Australia’s educated classes in the
Commonwealth’s pre-TAMMANY or ante-
graft period. Last week there were practi-
cally no public protests from the leaders of
the community—for the apparent reason
that Australia’s political conscience was one
of its war-casualties. If a similar spirit of
cynicism proves to have extended to pro-
fessions which cnee prided themselves on
their delicate and high conception of honor,
the country is indeed in a bad way. So far
as the Bray charges are concerned it appears
to this paper that, if no investigatory move
is made now, those whose business it is to
move in matters of the sort will, automati-
cally, forfeit the right to act in any future
case where a suspicion of professional mis-
conduct has been aroused as the outcome of
evidence given in a public court.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The A.I.F.’s “D—d Good-natured
Friend.”
After every great war the same phenomenon
is to be seen. A moment arrives when it
becomes safe to mention that the soldiers
were not “heroes all,” or “the cream of the
nation,” or “saviours of the Empire, to be
remembered gratefully, each and all, to the
end of time,” or any of the other things that
the Jingoes said they were during the danger-
years. People begin to point out, at first
in whispers but eventually in bold phrases
and ringing tones, that the army was but a
fly-blown affair, after all, in the moral sense;
that, though it no doubt contained many
men quite as good as the steady, sensible
young fellows who stayed at home, yet a
deplorably large proportion were adven-
turers, drunkards, criminals and gaol-
birds. The psychological explanation of
this change is simple. National dan-
gers tend to be forgotten once they have
been effectively dispelled; and the necessity
of having to pay in taxation for a peril which
is past becomes irksome. The soldier ceases
to represent salvation: rather he becomes a
nuisance who, in pensions, gratuities, war-
service homes and settlement schemes per-
sonifies ruin. It is not generally understood by
the harassed taxpayers that a large percent-
age of the gigantic sums borrowed on the
soldiers’ account has been blewed in depart-
mental expenses; that the chief beneficiaries
and pensioners are job-wanglers in the public
service and speculators outside it. At the
same time a younger generation is growing
up, a generation which was not old enough
during the war to be interested in the rav-
ings of the political war-winners. These
young men and women made no pro-
mises ; they got nothing out of the war,
and only in the case of the most imaginative
are they able to envisage what the fighters
had to endure. It is only natural that most
of them should be a little lacking in enthusi-
asm. And, finally, there is the considerable
host of non.starters —the eligibles who should
have gone overseas but preferred to stay at
home, and who have not forgotten or for-
given the covert slights and open in-
sults they had to put up with on that
account. Taken in the mass, this represents
a formidable body of opinion ready to be
mobilised against the ex-soldiers, and the
task is undertaken readily, not to say joy-
ously, by a type of citizen who invariably
appears as the Army’s “d —d good-natured
friend.” He makes it his business, “in the
interests of the public and the better class
of soldier,” to give the Army a thorough
clean-up. It matters not to the cleaner-up
that his task is done in a manner which
would have got him a term of penal servi-
tude had he undertaken it while the war was
on—his idea of deodorising the Army being
to figuratively empty bucket after bucket of
slops over it. He perseveres. As he does his
cleaning-up in sections, as it were, now ex-
posing the infamies of ex-soldiers on
orchards; now pointing to the drunkenness
and theft prevalent amongst ex-soldiers _ on
hen-farms ; now turning to the blackguardism
prevalent among ex-soldiers in the city ; and
as he undertakes each exposure, allegedly at
the urgent demand of persons who lare
vaguely adumbrated as “Diggers of the better
class,” in all the circumstances it is not
long before he creates an impression that,
with the exception of a few anonymous
“better-class” soldiers, the A.I.F. was com-
posed of malefactors. It is a fact which
must have struck everyone who has observed
the activities of this class of reformer that
he is never an ex-soldier, but almost invari-
ably one who should have been a soldier.
Anil if it doesn’t suggest something to the
Diggers, then they are not the shrewd rea-
soners they were in days gone by. The R.S.
Leagues have little power these days. They
have been divided by unscrupulous politicians,
parsons and priests on too many issues. But
on one point they'ought to be solid, namely,
that any eligible who, having omitted to fight
with the A.I.F. overseas, has the hardihood
to talk of reforming it at home, shall feel
the full weight of their displeasure. All his-
tory proves that the bravest and best of
armies is liable,-if its reputation is com-
mitted to the care of anyone who cares to
nominate himself for the job, of being pre-
sented as a thing of shame by those who
were once made to feel shame because they
were not in it.
Losing Patience with Fitzdoodle.
The prize idiocy of the Federal election
campaign was effectuated on Thursday, when
a quarter-hundred Labor candidates, not in-
cluding Ananias, put their names (not very
well written, most of them) to “A Chal-
lenge” :
They repeat the deliberate lie that Labor’s policy
stands for the confiscation of the farmers’ farms,
the workmen’s tools, and the business men’s busi-
nesses, and other rubbish regarding the objective.
The Labor objective and policy have not been altered
in essence or meaning, and Labor declares its
intention to interfere with property only, and mark
the word only, when the ownership of such property
is used to exploit the people. .. .Any statement to
the contrary is an unmitigated lie.
Then, writing in a voice that was pale with
indignation, and foaming at the mouth with
scorn, they went on: —
The undersigned Labor candidates hereby issue
a challenge to any person or newspaper to state
that they support a policy to interfere with private
property otherwise than as set out herein to do so
and they will immediately be given an opportunity
to attempt to substantiate the statement in the
Law Courts of the country.
The grammar may be dark, but the meaning
is clear. It is all a question whether
a herd of party candidates, all with the
party endorsement and nomination, are
assumed to “support” the party platform,
including “the socialisation of industry, pro-
duction, distribution and exchange,” which
seems to imply a considerable amount
of interference with everything. If
they aren’t, what do they support, apart,
of * course, from their aged parents?
If they are, the situation couldn’t be much
worse if Archbishop Kelly came into court
and demanded damages for being called a
Catholic —a tactical error which that subtle
cleric has hitherto astutely avoided. Seeing
that the indignant bag of candidates had
been accused about a million times of advo-
cating confiscation, including, in some cases,
repudiation of the public debt, it was a pity
they didn’t contribute to the gaiety of nations
by issuing a few thousand writs right off,
instead of threatening to wade in blood
in the event of the million-and-oneth insult
coming along. It rather suggests the tall melo-
dramatic hero, and his attitude while being-
arrested once more at the instance of the
villain with the sneer and the cigarette.
Drawing himself to his full height of Bft., he
says, or he used to say in Bland Holt’s
day: “Beware, Clifford Fitzdoodle! You
have ruined my aged mother and driven her
to the grave! You have robbed me of my
character and my wife and child, and con-
signed me to a dungeon ! But don’t go too
far!” The 25 Laborites are also going for
Clifford Fitzdoodle if lie drives the aged
parent to many more graves.
The B.M.A. Strikes Trouble.
“That in the captain’s but a choleric word which
in a soldier is flat blasphemy.”
A nod is reputed to be as good as a wink to
a hlind horse, and on that principle the
£2OOO damages which a Sydney jury gave
Dr. Thompson, of Randwick, on Friday last
should act as a broad hint to the medical
profession of N. S. Wales. Dr. Thompson
is one of those necessarily unpopular beings
in conventional circles, a congenital re-
former. In particular, he holds strong views
about the N. S. Wales lunacy laws, and
that there is some basis for his views is
evident from the fact that the Fuller Gov-
ernment has just appointed a Commission
to inquire into the subject. When the
apparently harmless Chidley was put into
Callan Park to die, Dr. Thompson pro-
tested, and he also took a prominent part
in the Farr case. In the course of the
latter agitation he wrote to the late John
Storey (then Premier) :
The case requires sifting to the bottom. Mrs.
Farr is certainly not insane now, whatever she may
have been. It is scandalous that certain persons
who are gaining thereby should have the power to
kidnap people and keep them in prison at their own
sweet will.
And he wrote later in the Evening News—
It is outrageous that private doctors should have
power to imprison people.
At about this stage the Council of the
N. S. Wales branch of the B.M.A. met
and expelled him for “conduct deroga-
tory to the honor and integrity of
the medical profession.” In the case of a
Sydney suburban g.p., expulsion from the
B.M.A. is very like what excommunication
was in 12th-century England. A doctor who
suffers this punishment cannot get patients
into private hospitals; he cannot secure
anaesthetists; specialists will not take cases
sent on by him, and no one of standing will
consult with him or act as his locum tenons.
In short, he is faced with a more rigid, com-
prehensive and ruinous boycott than mid-
Victorian Ireland ever knew. Some months
after Dr. Thompson’s expulsion, Smith’s
Weekly revealed the activities of Dr.
Zlotkowski. This man did not give
up his time, gratis, to the task of get-
ting people out of asylums: he earned a large
income by frightening some of them into
asylums on the false pretence that they
or their relations had T.B. Many members
of the B.M.A. knew all about Zlotkowski
and his method of earning a livelihood.
Yet the 8.M.A., as an organisation,
did nothing. And if Parliament had
not forced matters by causing Zlot-
kowski to be dealt with under the
Medical Act he might still be where the
B.M.A. has declared Dr. Thompson un-
worthy to be—on the Register of the pro-
fession. The line of cross-examination
adopted by counsel for the B.M.A. in Dr.
Thompson’s suit showed pretty clearly what
his real offence was in the eyes of the gov-
erning body of his profession. He was
asked if he was not a Labor man, if he had
not opposed conscription, if he had not
caused trouble in other parts of the world,
and many more questions so irrelevant that
the Judge eventually informed the K.C. who
was putting them that their only effect was
to convict his owu clients of malice. Dr.
Zlotkowski was no agitator; his sort never
are. He was a Nationalist in politics, a
sound Empire man, and a prominent mem-
ber of the University Club. Is it not rea-
sonable to assume that the jury, in giving
the smashing damages it did against the
8.M.A., last week, was registering a protest
against a dangerous form of professional
discrimination?
a
The Will of the Oily Wisp.
Dear Bulletin, —The dreary old search for
Australian oil, so that we may save the
four millions or more per annum which goes
abroad for greasy materials, and may drive
our own buzz-waggon proudly with our own
great natural resources, has received another
bad advertisement. I don’t very clearly re-
call when it received much else. To begin
with, Allen Taylor, a Sydney knight
of mixed pursuits and heavy tonnage,
and, incidentally, one of the Reform aider-
men who wandered off with the Labor or
Tammany party at the recent mayoral elec-
tion, is interested in an oil-search company
which is groping underground in the Roma-
Blackall region of Queensland. Roma is
a hope or cat of long standing. Oil was
suspicioned or smelt by sanguine parties
there long ago, and the bore is down some
4000 ft. without any satisfactory result.
Taylor, the glaived and belted paint-
expert, alleged that the well-known Pro-
fessor David “had given his unqualified
opinion that the Lander proposition
was undoubtedly a great commercial one,
worthy of the fullest possible support
and encouragement.” Whereupon the Pro-
fessor arrived on both feet to deny that he
had said anything of the sort. The utmost
encouragement he would give was to the
effect that in the Roma-Blackall district in-
dications are “promising”—not performing.
Leaving these two intellectual giants to
batter each other about on the windy west-
ern plain, I suggest that the Federal Gov-
ernment should withdraw its foolish offer
of £50.000 for the discoverv of a gushing
well which will produce 50,000 gallons of
kerosene and be still going—if the miserable
thing is still open. That £50.000 offer will
probably be the means by which smart people
with paid-up promoters’ shares will induce
less smart people with contributing shares
to waste £lOO.OOO by driblets here and there
to no purpose. If Australia is an oil-coun-
try, which, apart from its modest deposits
of kerosene shale, it apparently isn’t, the
fact will assert itself in the right place
sooner or later, and hunting in all the wrong
places is waste of energy, though it may
make an interesting fuss on the Stock Ex-
change. Bursting sources of affluence like
those which made the fortunes of John
Stofel and Gilead P. Beck in fiction, and
Rockefeller and co. in fact, can no more
remain permanently concealed than an
active volcano or a city set upon a hill.
At June, 1919 (later figures seem to be
scarce), there were 8578 artesian or sub-
artesian bores in Queensland, the oil dream-
ers’ land of promise, and there are more
now. They represented 3,306,789 ft. or 626 A
miles of exploration underground. They
proved the limits of the artesian area. They
located kerosene shale, coal, gold, one or two
dozen minor metals, gems, bones, sundries
and trash, also the smell, or alleged smell,
at Roma; but they didn’t produce even one
assured pint of “ile.” And 1215 bores in
the other States had no better luck. There-
fore, I propose that oil research should be
hindered rather than bonused, and that every
possible encouragement should be given in-
stead to the manufacture of industrial alco-
hol, that being a feasible way of reducing
our dependence on the foreign supplier,
while oil-hunting is too like seeking for a
Melbourne Cup winner in a dark cellar or
hunting for buried treasure in a haystack.
When the stuff turns up it will be welcome,
like the Holy Grail, but a promiscuous and
costly search for oil or Grail is not worth
the energy expended on it. There is pro-
bably oil in sea-serpents, most sea-denizens
being oily; but it isn’t advisable either that
the Government should offer £50,000 reward
to the finder of a deposit, or that people
should put their hard-earned savings into
even the most promising company that was
ever formed to go whaling for serpents.
Some ventures are best left to good old Pro-
vidence. —Yours, etc., Griffith Moses.
Christmas and Charity.
“Sky Pilot” on the spirit of the hour: —
The philanthropic emotions which overcome many
people as Christmas Day approaches a ie agreeable
to witness if only because they show that at bottom
man is altruistic after all. Christmas has ever been
associated with giving. (lifts were laid upon the
altars of the gofis at the time of the winter solstice;
gifts of gold, frankincense ai d myrrh were presented
by the Magi to the infant Jesus, whose natal day we
celebrate, and through the centuries the poor have
ever received gifts at this season of the year. But
without wishing to sound a discordant note, it is
impossible to avoid recognising that the time has come,
in Australia at least, for the subject of Christmas
charity to be reviewed. The appeals which, for
weeks, have been appearing in the daily papers of
our great cities—and which have appeared annually
for as long as any of us can remember —create feel-
ings of misgiving in the hearts of the judicious.
The charity business appears to have now become
thoroughly systematised, and must be recognised as one
of the established institutions of the country, as in the
older lands. But this is a position which all who
realise the magnificent potentialities of Australia,
and who at the same time value the self-respect
of its people, should not only deplore, but do their
utmost to prevent. As one who has spent some
years amongst the low lodging-houses and mission-
halls of East London, and has seen the injurious
effects which charity doles have upon the self-
dignity of the recipients, the writer hates to read
or hear of public appeals for Ragged Schools, Slum
Missions, charity dinners and the like. That we
have unemployment, with its consequent want and
misery, is to our discredit. It means that the
natural resources which are the people’s birthright are
being selfishly monopolised, and that avenues of
employment are being capriciously closed. To main-
tain the existing social and economic order so that
benevolent people may have an outlet for their
charity is poor business indeed. William Blake
once wrote
Pitv would be no more
If we did not make somebody poor,
And Mercy no more could be
If all were as happy as we.
Society should gladly take the risk... .General Booth
asked for a million sterling to raise “the sub-
merged tenth” of England. He got his million,
but the submerged are still there, and have in-
creased fourfold. Charity is no cure for want;
and whilst it is gratifying to see generous expres-
sions of it once a year, yet something more scientific,
something that will grapple with the causes of
poverty is the vital necessity. Australia started
badly. The errors of the old lands were repeated
here, and we continue the - folly. “The fathers did
eat sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are
set on edge.” Lands were squandered, and private
monopolies created where no monopolies should have
been permitted. The result is a growing and chronic
unemployment. With right government there should
not be an unemployed person in Australia, and char-
ity should be needless. Things are rotten when, in
a country like this, a system of agrarian, social
and economic injustice is permitted to obtain, pro-
ducing increasing worklessness, pauperism and slum-
dom. It should make a true-blue Australian surge
with rage to hear the collection boxes rattling on the
streets for legless soldiers, for hospitals and even for
a mendicant religion. Cripples, the sick, the
weak-minded should be our especial care, as
the necessitous members of the family; but
meeting their wants should have no taint of
charity. The thing should be regarded as
a matter-of-fact duty. It is very pleasant to
feel generous once a year—it aids complacence--
but to. feel just for 365 days in the year in straight-
ening out the social tangle and destroying the
excrescence of unemployment, by securing every
man his rights, would be better, and more in keeping
with the true genius of Christmas.

The Overtasked Kid.
Ethel Turner Curlewis, writer of whole-
some Australian books, spoke some whole-
some Australian truths last week at a prize-
giving in Sydney Girls’ High School. Her-
self an ex-student of the institution, and
quite its most distinguished production, she
harked back pleasantly to the days when
“I sat down there in the body of the hall, in
white muslin and a pigtail, and waited, with
beating heart, to see if I had won a prize.”
Then, becoming critical, as well as reflective,
she remarked -
I had too much to do. And I very much suspect
you have... .The thing that makes the trouble to-day
is precisely what made the trouble in my own day:
the pace is too fast; the examination standard i n
nearly all subjects is set too high. Looking back, I
have poignant memories of the price some of the
girls paid for their high places. Many a one has
shaken her head over the remembrance of the burden
of homework and the heavy strain that Was necessary
if one aspired to anything more than a mediocre
pass. If there had been just a little more margin
left to them in a day for joy. for fun, for beauty,
for pure idleness, it might have made, they have
said, a difference to all their lives—might have
made healthy, radiant, well-balanced women of them,
as well as well-educated ones. I see quite a lot of
clever schoolgirls at this time of year, when examina-
tions are just over, and I see a lot of black shadows
under young eyes, and dull complexions and narrow
chests. And I know enough of the work at present
being done to recognise that the examination strain
is not lessening but increasing with the years. Young


Not Meat but MARMITE
AND BETTER FOR YOUR HEALTH.
Bread, thinly sliced and spread with butter and the merest speck of Marmite —
how good it is, how delicately flavored, how “different”! Marmite gives you
a new idea of what a sandwich should be.
Marmite immensely improves the flavor of gravies, soups, stews and sauces,
and makes a delicious drink, a drink pleasing to the palate, but that builds the
body too.
Marmite is a vegetable extract, rich in vitamines, and possessing the same
natural value as a well-prepared meat extract, but without the dietetic disadvan-
tages of meat. It is highly concentrated, and therefore very economical in use.
Remember, too much spoils the flavor!

girls are like young roses, and you can rarely force
the pace of girl or rose without serious mischief.
That needed saying, and a woman a
national reputation for an understanding of
and a sympathy with the child mind was
needed to say it. The lady novelist’s indictment
will be endorsed (silently, of course, for a
stupid convention forbids them to speak out)
by 95 per cent, of the medical men practis-
ing in Sydney ; and not in Sydney alone. For
the pedagogic craze for examinations is not
confined to one city or State, nor is it in-
dulged in exclusively at the expense of high-
school girls. Like the companion craze for
homework—the barbarous invention of some
dull dog who didn’t know his job—it is an
integral part of all our Government educa-
tional systems. The result of this mania for
homework and examinations is to make the
acquisition of knowledge a burden when it
could be made a delight. Perhaps the physi-
cal effects on the boys are neutralised by
the playground, but the girl victims, as Mrs.
Curlewis points out, are apt to become
anrnmic and neurotic, and to develop into
the fretful, neurasthenic type of female —
one of the burdens of modern civilisation —
whose life is one surgical operation after
another. A pestilent form of the examination
disease, which rages chiefly among private
teachers and denominational schools, is the
musical exam. The idea was born in Eng-
land, most backward of musical nations, and
the examiners are often imported from, that
country. Shameful is the way children are
crammed for these absurd tests. At any time
during 10 months of the year thousands of
them may be found struggling with the hiero-
glyphics in which the grammarians of music
express themselves, and puzzling their brains
over the posers which the professors of
“theory” propound. The off'—*- in a multi-
tude of cases, is to destrov the kid’s liking
for music, even if it doesn’t destroy the kid.
The Smashing of Hughesism.
Hughes beat Pipdington in North Sydney,
but Hughesism has been smashed. The
skipper saved his skin —he saw to that
beforehand —but the craft is on the rocks. In
the last Parliament the Government had 38
votes in a House of 75 members; should it
meet the next Parliament, which is doubtful,
it will be lucky if 24 members rally to its
tattered banner. Poynton, the Post-
master-General. Massy Greene, the Min-
ister of Defence, and Lamond, one of
the assistant Ministers, have been re-
jected. Millen, the Repatriation man,
and Earle, Vice-President of the Exe-
cutive Council, are in deadly danger.
Others who have paid for the sms of the
Government with their political heads are
Wise, who was Postmaster-General until the
last reshuffle of portfolios; Laird Smith,
who was Minister for the Navy; Blun dell,
M.H.R. for Adelaide; Story,' M.H.R. for
Boothby (S.A.) ; Chanter, M.H.R. for
Riverina (N.S.W.), and Higgs, M.H.R. for
Capricornia (Q.) ; and it looks as if Bam-
eord (Herbert) and Foley (Kalgoorlie) will
be numbered with the slain. All these men
are personal followers of the Prime Minister,
and so are some of the Senators who are evi-
dently doomed — Senior (S.A.), Thomas
(N.S.W.), Henderson, Buzacott, De
Largie (W.A.), and, perhaps, Plain
(Vic.). In the 21 years that have
elapsed since the first Commonwealth
Parliament met in Melbourne, no ministerial
party has ever been more roughly handled.
The Labor Opposition did fairly well, and
would have done better but for its pacifist
and Socialist nonsense. It owes the few
seats it gained, not to any marked approval
of the imported objective, but to (1) univer-
sal weariness of the Hughes dictatorship,
(2) a turnover of civil-service votes round
about Sydney, (3) a revulsion of feeling in
S.A. against the Black Australianism of
Barwell, and (4) the small polls recorded
everywhere. It invariably profits when the
proportion of votes is below the average.
The Country party gained two or three seats
and would have gained several more had
the election been held after the harvest, as
authorised by a referendum which the Gov-
ernment, in the hone of dishing the Cockies,
ignored. In Queensland, moreover, this
party was heavily handicapped, inasmuch as,
unlike both Nationalists and Laborites, it
refused to offer the unrealisable bribe of a
renewal of the sugar agreement. However,
the Agrarians are strong enough to settle
Hughes’s hash, whatever happens. He will
probably try to carry on until Parliament
assembles, but this shouldn’t be permitted.
Those who call themselves Nationalists are
all of the Liberal persuasion. Apart from
the Priminister the Labor section of the
coalition, as far as the House of Reps, is
concerned, has been wiped out, and Hughes
was only preserved from the same fate by
his cunning in manoeuvring himself into a
Liberal seat. The obvious policy for the
Liberal-Nationalists is to associate with
the Country party, and the Liberals
who reject the Nationalist label, in the
formation of a Government with Watt or
Pratten as Prime Minister, and the Agrari-
ans represented in proportion to their
strength. If the fallen dictator and fig-leaf
Socialist is allowed to thwart this arrange-
ment, those who have followed him too
blindly will be mad indeed.
Metal Troubles.
The N.S.W. iron and steel workers scored
a victory last week—the same sort that the
suicide scores when his hanging passes off
without a hitch. It was achieved before , a
Court composed of a full-blown Justice and
two Judges, and concerned the Broken Hill
Prop.’s steel works at Newcastle, which have
been closed for some time, leaving 5000
men out of employment, and Newcastle almost
as dead as other towns where similar great
victories have been scored. Wages being
already higher than the industry could pay,
at the present buying nrce of coal and sell-
ing xjriee of iron and steel, the Court gave
them another lift, and thus put the stoppage
beyond any possible, probable shadow of
doubt. Taking a few figures at casual dates
from the handy “Quarterly Summary of Aus-
tralian Statistics” this was the progress of
events: —■

king, save the aboriginal Billy variety,
would envy, but the iron and steel trade is
a fearsome consumer of coal, and coal costs
THE HAPPY DESPATCH.
“The Prime Minister has won a seat but lost an election. The Coalition is doomed.”— A. B. Piddington .
THE AUSTRALIAN KID: “I was never so pleased about a funeral in my life.”
the N.S.W. ironmaker twice as much as is
paid by his brother who talks through his
nose at Pittsburg (U.S.A.). And the price
of coal doubled between 1915 and 1920. Still,
the industry got along and kept 5000 men
and their families till the 44-hours’ craze
added one-twelfth to the working costs with
no special advantage to the men, save that
they had more spare time on their hands in
a town of very few attractions, the number
of hours off duty per week being increased
from 120 to 124 in theory, while in reality
they were increased the whole 168. The
fall in the value of the finished product, and
the rise in coal, might have made trouble in
any case, but the 44 hours rendered trouble
certain. Awhile ago Judge Rolin, after
going into the company’s figures, allowed a
reduction in some branches, but not in
others, to the legal basic wage, the figures
having formerly been much higher, but this
didn’t nearly bridge the loss. An applica-
tion, last week, to a Justice and a pair of
Judges to bring the rates down to tb h asic
wage all round brought the unexpected re-
sult that the previous reduction was abol-
ished and the wages put up again to the
point that caused the original stoppage.
There was no careful investigation of figures
this time; but the decision was reached on
quite different grounds. The co. was asked
to consent that the unions might apply,
w’henever profits loomed on the horizon, to
have the back reduction made up to
them. This opened up the weird
possibility that, if the co. resumed
work at the beginning of 1923. in
addition to working at an estimated loss of
about £BO,OOO a year (unless further sav-
ings could be made) it would be piling up a
possible liability of another £BO,OOO a year,
the amount of the wage reduction. If profits
began to show in 1928 they would have to
be applied (1) to putting the wages back
at the old figure, and (2) to refunding a
dead horse of £400,000. The co. presumably
looked at the matter from all angles, and
saw three advantages in keeping the works
closed indefinitely: (1) It couldn’t lose
money on the working of them, anyhow;
(2) it would be under no obligation to raise
anybody’s wages in 1928; (3) it wouldn’t
owe £400,000 of back pay to anybody in
1.925. It was at this point that the Court
became heated and put up the purely imagi-
nary and non-existent pay to the old figure,
which was a kindly act but rather futile.
Something might be done, or, at least, some-
thing might be demonstrated, if the unions
started business at current rates for them-
salves, but no one seems to have heard that
this is contemplated.
An Involved Affair.
The wav it appeared to Solomon Mal-
aprop:—
The Fed»ral election struggle was almost torpid
in places, hut at North Sydney, where Hughes and
Piddington met with all their intellectual resources,
also with their naval and military forces and with
aeroplanes, submarines, libels and dogs, things were
active enough. It was a whole education to hear
these embattled giants shout in their sulphurous
canopy, as the Hohenlinden poet had it, when the
sun was low and Iser was rolling rapidly. Consider
for instance, the blood-curdling revelation re Pidding-
ton’s appointment (simultaneously with that of
Powers) to the High Court bench, and his prompt
resignation. What I heard was that Piddington,
on his way out from England, received a cable from
Hughes saying that a dangerous enemy of his
(Hughes’s) w*s on board. This person was in a
position to disclose Hughes’s secret correspondence
with the German Emperor during the war. The war
didn’t happen till long after, but blood-curdling
revelations don’t stop for small discrepancies. Hughes
asked Piddington, as an old friend, to kill this malig-
nant person, and promised him half his next public
testimonial and a seat on the High Court bench.
Piddington accordingly threw the miscreant over-
board in the Indian Ocean, but apparently he could
swim, for Piddington Saw him, or his ghost or his
twin brother, just as he was about to ascend the
bench, and fearing to be denounced in open court
he resigned. It afterwards proved to be a case
of mistaken identity, but Hughes declined, in a
speech two columns long, to make the appointment
over again. He also demanded to see the body, and
Piddington told him to go to the Indian Ocean
and dash well look for it. After that Hughes
flatly refused to part with half of his £25,000
testimonial. The publication of the ex-Kaiser’s
memoirs in the Sydney Telegraph, combined with
the house-famine and Hughes’s inability to stick on
his horse for any length of time, brought matters
to a crisis, esDecially as the dead man turned up
after all and demanded permanent alimony on the
£l5 a week scale, or in default a handsome
settlement. That would have been some-
thing like a revelation, especially as more
corpses and some robberies could be put in if thought
necessary. But after all it seems that Hughes has
merely said, or is said to have said, with some
detail, that Piddington resigned his brand-new
honor in those bygone years because the Bar was
hostile, and he didn’t like to have the
Bar gnashing its teeth at him during
court proceedings—which was much the reason
why a bigger and more Hebraic man (Julian
Salomons, to wit) made a lightning exit from the
N.S.W. Chief Justiceship. As a matter of fact
many barristers considered they had higher claims
to a place on the High Court Bench than either
Piddington o v PowEßs, especially the latter, and
some papers said so, and some (or more) Judges
were suspected of thinking so. Anyhow Piddington
went out and Powers didn’t. The rival story is that
Piddington was sounded per cable at Port Said by a
person named X. to find out if he was a State-Frighter of
the Samuel Griffith type or a believer in giving
the Commonwealth the benefit of the doubt when
authorities clashed. It transpired that he was a
Federalist. The appointment happened along. Later, it
being borne in on Piddington that X. might be really
Hughes, tliMy disguised in a wig and false whiskers,
he realised the impropriety of the thing and saw that
his position was as false as Hughes’s whiskers, so
he resigned and sold his wig and judging tools at
a sacrifice—nine years ago. Those who were to be
his colleagues on the bench spoke kindly of his exit,
and said nothing about the lack of Powers’s exit. For
the life of me I was unable to see why Hughes
shouldn't have been X, or even XXX if he felt in-
clined. And I was still in this bemused frame of
mind when The Bulletin’s old friend Dowell
O’Reilly executed an astonishing saut de chat and
landed in the middle of the S. M. Herald with the
intimation that he was “X,” and had the lost will
and other documentary evidence on his person to
prove it. And then there were some recriminatory
remarks about Piddington having been photo-
graphed in someone else’s wig—which charge was
held to be a complete vindication of Hughes’s
action in attempting to rig the High Court for the
benefit of the Labor party—and the proceedings
terminated with a hearty vote of thanks to all
present.
■ •
“Rio”: Many stupid things were said during
the election campaign by opponents of com-
pulsory training. One was that “the majo-
rity of those who won commissions in the
war were not trainees.” Now, training be-
gan in July, 1911, with boys who became
14 to 17 in that year. In July, 1914, the
oldest were only 20, and training was then
suspended for the war. Then, because some
of these lads were becoming officers, orders
were issued that commissions were not to
be given to soldiers under 23. Now’ ouly
one year’s quota of trainees could be 23 in
191.7 and another in 1918. Or, put it this
way: No trainees were eligible for commis-
sions in 1914, 1915 or 1916, w’hile in 1917
and 1918 only those wdiose 23rd birthday
occurred in those years were qualified. More-
over all the trainees didn’t enlist. Again,
the small amount of pre-war training v r as
retarded by want of drill halls, miniature
ranges, stables, instructional gear and pro-
perly-equipped camping-grounds ; also, by the
scarcity of efficient citizen officers and
n.c.o.’s, not to mention ofher
incident to the inauguration of an entirely
new system with its rapidly-expanding units j
while the training, since the war, has been
interfered with by continual changes and
reductions. No trainee has ever had even
a quarter of the instruction originally in-
tended, and most not a tenth. This being
so, all comments on the results of the scheme
are merely hot air. The writer will admit
that any defence scheme that does not give
its trainees 10 years’ training, with 10
days annually in camp, or 60 days straight-
out, is useless. The present so-called econo-
mical system only repeats annually the
drudgery of elementary drill. It is worse
than useless, for it kills the youth’s enthusi-
asm and makes him fed up with all military
work.
•
“Ashmead”: Launceston (T.) was the first
city in the Commonwealth to try the experi-
ment of a city manager, and has been
arguing about it ever since. From the out-
set a section of the aldermen w 7 as opposed
to the manager, and it made things so warm
for him that the badgered functionary in-
vited the Council to say whether he w r as
to be manager or office-boy. The city dads
replied with the sack and three months’
salary in lieu of notice. Three aldermen
recently retired by rotation, and all put up
for re-election as an anti-manager party.
They were opposed by pro-managers
chosen by a meeting of citizens, at which
1200 were present. Two antis were returned
and one pro. The Council now’ consists of
four pledged to support the ex-manager,
three decidedly against him, and two (the
retiring Mayor and his successor in the
chair) not particularly keen either way,
albeit they were part of the" majority that
shunted the official. It is possible that the
gentleman may be reinstated ; more possible
that fresh applications will be called for.
But the betting is in favor of reversion to
the happy-go-lucky and wasteful methods of
aldermanic control.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The wretchedly attenuated character of
Saturday’s poll proves again that Australia
requires the compulsory vote, only with a
difference. The voter should have three
alternatives, not two —to vote for the can-
didate he likes best; to \ r ote for the one he
hates least; or to vote against the lot.
Where several are to be elected, as in the
case of the Senate on Saturday, he should
be allowed to give a vote partly affirmative
and partly negative. Where negative
votes beat affirmative ones there should be
a new election with new candidates. It is
absurd that the person who thinks his
group or pair of candidates —say, his Hughes
and Piddington—both unworthy, should only
be able to express himself by staying away
and letting the AA’orst man win. If, at a
liquor referendum, the only names on the
ballot-paper were Continuance and Reduc-
tion, and the negative voter, Prohibition,
could only express himself by not expressing
himself, the row would be considerable.
“D.E.”: I knew the Hugheseliers Avere
gone Avhen the Sydney Sunday Times
espoused their cause. That extraordinary
paper, which apparently gets its ideas of poli-
tics by hanging round pitcher-shows and jazz
cafes, backs a loser every time. In its pre-
election issue it predicted that 43 of the
75 Representatives would be pro-Billy. And
the morning after the day of wrath it an-
nounced that “Mr. Hughes, as the Sunday
Times confidently anticipated last Sunday,
is well ahead of all other parties.... Official
Labor will be as impotent in the new Parlia-
ment as it was in the last, and the narrow,
self-seeking Farmers’ party has been treated
with an indifference bordering upon con-
tempt.” The post-election comments in the
Sydney papers were mostly fatuous, but the
depths of complacent imbecility were
plumbed by the Times.
Recognising that Soviet Russia, which
our _ Bolsheviks hold up as a bright and
shining example, is also something of a
pauper and a ruin, the “Society of Techni-
cal Aid to Soviet Russia” has been formed
in Sydney. Its members are to straggle
along to the Land of Dope and Gory, carry-
ing their own tools and finding their own
expenses, and take a hand in the urgent
work of soleing and heeling the republic.
The first gang, consisting of coal-miners, is
supposed to start some time in March next,
but may be delayed till April, the first of
Avhich month, by the Avay, would be an ap-
propriate date for the, inauguration of the
crusade.
N.S.W.’s financial returns for the first
five months of the glad new (financial)
year were the usual sort. The income from
Government enterprises of all kinds, from the
railways and tramways down to the State’s
itinerant tinker’s shop, if there is such a
thing, was £160.522 more than in the corres-
ponding period of the previous year. And
the bill for interest on the loans with which
these businesses are established was £335,292
more than for the similar five months of
last year, so the State was £174,770 worse
off. The whole loan mystery consists of in-
curring another shilling of loan interest to
build public works that earn sixpence.
Peacock, Minister for Labor, warded off a
sectarian debate by withdrawing a clause
exempting charity laundries from the wages-
board provision When the Factories Bill
was before Vic. Assembly. He had to con-
dense the bill severely to get it through, and
it was only the shadow of its original self
when it was read a third time. Grand
Master Snowball was ready with an inspec-
tion amendment, directed against Magdalen
Asylum laundry, and Greenwood and
Featherston were waiting to follow up the
attack. They will have to restrain them-
selves till August.

rather unexpectedly Avon in Oxley (Q.), is

parson who shepherded his flock in Leich-
hardt (Sydney) until a call to Brisbane took

eminent historical characters. Thus the

ter of Customs, had the fight of his life in
Wannon (Vic.), and didn’t improve his
chances by the testiness he showed during
the campaign. In an encounter with a well-
known Melbourne journalist, who had signed
an article hostile to the Hughes crowd, Rod-
gers exhibited none of the geniality with
which he used to be credited until he became
associated with Billy. He likewise had a
tourney with the Police Department, and
retired with ruffled feathers. When Hughes
visited Horsham a fur.ous unorganised dis-
turbance occurred at his meeting. The Pri-
minister and Rodgers both requested the
four policemen present to tip out the turbu-
lent mob, but the discreet Johns declined for
fear of precipitating a riot. Rodgers
vehemently protested to police headquarters,
and a special officer was sent up to inquire
into the matter. He returned to Melbourne
with a report confirming the attitude of his
subordinates, and stating that a great
majority of the residents considered their
conduct beyond reproach.
During the late Vic. session, which ended
on 95 bills were whisked through
both Houses, 01 in the last 11 days. McPher-
son’s pet Charities Bill was saved, and the
finishing touches were put on a bunch of
measures relating to electricity supply from
Morwell. But Prendergast’s proposals for
the abolition of aldermen w r ere lost, and an-
other Labor bill, enabling women candidates
to nominate for the Uppah House, failed to
get the absolute majority required.
According to N.S.W.’s new Treasurer, the
awful Dooley Labor Government bumped to
its doom with a shortage of £1,329,000 for
its final year, and an accumulated deficit of
£3.578,000. It is a record for Australia, but
not a world record. An Austrian Finance
Minister of rather over a century ago left
a deficit which was described as “four tons
of gold,” and left with it no explanation as
to Avhere the 80cwt. of sovereigns had gone
to. And he was such an important person
that people felt it would be impertinent to
inouire.
Fremantle (W.A.), which has always here*
tofore been furiously partisan, has returned
about the only genuine Independent to the
House of Reps, in the person of one William
Watson, a local butter-dealer. Some
of the Sydney papers perversely claimed
Watson as a thinly disguised Nationalist;
the best comment on that is from his own
election manifesto: —
The National Government, with its usual blatant
hypocrisy, prates of what it did for you [the Diggers]
in the dark days of the war. You know it failed
miserably to give you anything like a fair go, but,
now that the election is near, will promise every-
thing.
To suggest that a candidate who has deli-
vered himself of those sentiments is a likely
follower of Hughes is surely the last word
in stupidity. Watson, who lost two sons
in the war, has done golden deeds for the
Diggers, and they didn’t forget him on
Saturday.
On the alarming mortality among
Hugheseliers:—
The second Hughes Ministry, which lasted from
Nov. 14, 1916, to Feb. 17, 1917, had 14 supporters
in the House of Reps.—all Labor eohscriptionists
and eight of them were Ministers. They have all
gone, or are going, except Billy himself. Dankel
(Boothby) resigned in 1917, and Burchell (Fre-
mantle) a few months ago. The other 11 have
been beaten at the polls—Carr (Macquarie) and
Spence (Darling) in 1917; Lynch (Werriwa), Jen-
sen (Bass), Webster (Gwydir) and Archibald (Hind-
marsh) in 1919; Poynton (Grey), Thomas (Barrier),
Laird Smith (Denison), Chanter (Riverina) and Barn-
ford (Herbert) last week. Thomas saved his skin
for six years by transferring from the House of Reps,
to the Senate. A month after Spence’s defeat in
Darling (N.S.W.) he won a by-election in Bass
(T.), but recognising that he bad no chance there in
1919, he tried his luck in a Victorian constituency,
only to find it had deserted him. Of the 11 Labor
Senators who followed Hughes out of caucus in 1916,
five (Pearce, Lynch, Givens, Russell and Newland)
remain. Guthrie is dead, Story has lost Boothby,
where he succeeded Dankel, and the electors have sig-
nified that they are fed up with Henderson, Buza-
cott and De Largie.
One of the minor scandals of the late
struggle was the mysterious Percy Hunter.
He is paid a handsome salary by the Com-
monwealth to stay in London and attend
to the immigration problem. Some months
ago he arrived in Australia —at the public
expense—and while still drawing his screw
for the work he isn’t doing in England, pro-
ceeded to act as W. M. Hughes’s chief elec-
tioneering offsider. It is understood that
this remarkable performance will be one of
the first questions to engage the attention
of the new Parliament.
There will be a dense crowd under the
plum-tree when the composition of the Com-
monwealth Public Service Commission is
decided. It is to have a chairman at 12500
p.a. and two members at. £2OOO each. A\\ B.
Edwards, the previous Public Service Com-
missioner, has claims for the chief post, but
he is near the age for retirement, and his
chance is not so good as that of Colonel C. A\
'Wtrtsrm, ’D:S.f>„ Commissioner for Parents
and returned warrior. T. Trumble, secretary
of Defence, might get a call to one of tin*
chairs; and ,T. R. Collins, the sec. to
the Treasury, is a likely starter. Then
there is the pushing and priceless Atlee
Hunt. But the oracle may conceivably be
worked in favor of defeated Nationalist poli-
ticians. Something will really have to be
done for Poynton and Lamond.
“Bilclad” on a bit of fluff: —
A few years ago Australia was in great straits
because it had, by reason of too much import-
ing, practically no golden money to its credit in
England. large and prominent fluff-merchants
went to their banks, and put down £20,000 in Aus-
tralian paper, and said off-handedly: “Gimme a draft
payable in gold in London to liquidate my debt for
fluff.” And the banker replied gloomily ; “All this
paper, and 16 times as much, won’t purchase half-a-
pint of fluff in London, or anywhere else outside Aus-
tralia, unless there is gold to redeem it with, and at
present there is no gold. Therefore it is merely a
bad cheque. Gimme gold, or any old thing like
potatoes or wattle-bark that will sell in England
for gold, and .you can have your draft. Failing that,
please take your rag money out of the daylight.” Just
at present, by the accident of trade, the position is
reversed, and Australia in general has an unusual
amount to its credit in London. Excited people
talk of as much as £56,000,000, all available in
hard splosh. If there is anything like that amount
it is partly the result of recent borrowings, and.
with £250,000,000 of loans fulling due in the next
three years, the Government can’t do better than get
its salary-hook on the pile, and use it to prevent the
country being squeezed too brutally over the renewal.
But already fluff-mongers are writing to the papers
to say that the importation of glad rags should be
encouraged, presumably by reduced duties, to their
profit and the detriment of local industries, so that
all this coin may not “lie idle.” The idea that a
country with nearly £1,000,000,000 of debt should
have to buy extra blouses and hats to get rid of its
superfluous money is worthy of the fluff-dealing soul.

During the past six months £864,360 of the
new million issue was called up, and
when the balance has been got in during
th,» current half-year paid capital will be
six millions. Six years ago it was 34 mil-
lions, but the business has grown so rapidly
1 hat though the latest 10 p.c. required
£96,60!) more than the same rate of div. in
1916, and disclosed profits had declined to
the level of two years ago, there still re-
mained £67,305 for reserves. There were
several reasons why the term’s profits should
have been smaller. Though markets for
wool and wheat have been good, meat and
metals have not been in demand; many
manufacturing industries have been de-
pressed, and most othei'S less activeand
overseas trading has been restricted, and on
a lower-value basis. Exchange earnings have
consequently not been so large, and, in addi-
tion, a lot of money which the banks could
employ profitably in the Commonwealth lias
been tied up in London at low rates of in-
terest. For the first time on record exports
have been greatly in excess of imports, and
at September 30 the B.N.S.W. had
£4,195,000 in Treasury bills and at short
cail in London, compared with £1.300.000
12 months ago. These funds are earning
interest ranging between only 1 and 2 j p.c.
Further evidence is given by a comparison
of balance-sheet figures:—

Premises . . . . 795,000 800,000 800,000
During the 12 months to September 30 last
advances were reduced £943,825. Mean-
while the bank has been called upon to pay
interest on larger fixed deposits: in two
vears the proportion of interest-bearing de-
posits in all Australian banks has increased
from 47 to 54 p.c.
These various influences suggest a de-
cline of profits greater than disclosed by the
table. During the boom period, though, the
Wales’s management probably did not bring
into the light anything like the full measure
of earnings. Even when portion _ot the
abnormal exchange harvest was utilised to
give shareholders a bonus, disclosed earn-
ings in relation to funds were only a_few
decimals better than in pre-war days. 1 aid
capital is nowadays assisted by £3,827,438
of visible reserves, so when the balance of
the new issue is raised the bank’s own. funds
will have to earn only 6.1 p.c. to give 10
p.c. p.a. on capital. That makes the cus-
tomary rate of div. very secure, and share-
holder's who participated in the new T issues at
iiar are on an excellent wicket. The additional
capital has also considerably strengthened
the hank from the point of view of creditors.
At one stage during the abnormal period it
was holding slightly more than £B. of the
public’s money for every £1 of its own
funds. That is about the limit which is
generally deemed prudent for Australian
banking. With six millions paid capital and
more than 3f millions of reserves, latest
total liabilities are equal to not quite £6
3s. per £1 of the bank’s funds. So when
the money tied up in London is released tor
employment in the Commonwealth —that
adjustment will be effected automatically as
the relationship of imports to exports is
gradually restored to normal —the Bank of
N. S. Wales will, with its present funds, be
in an excellent position to take an active
part 'in the revival and expansion of Aus-
tralian trade and industry which can be ex-
pected when the existing depression passes.

This co. was established in Perth 10 years
ago to compete with old-established concerns
for local risks. In the early war days Sam
Copley, who had experienced a “run of luck”
in other gambles, introduced the young eo.
to the whirlpool of international marine
underwriting. The expansion of business
was phenomenal, and, as the figures in the
introductory and underwriting tables show,
huge profits were made with the assistance
of the British Navy. Within half-a-dozen
years reserves soared from a few hundreds
to more than three-quarters of a million.
Then the luck changed. For the past two
years there have been heavy losses, and after
providing for taxes incurred in the profit-
able years, writing down the book value of
securities and allowing for load and doubt-
ful book debts, reserves have slumped to
under £339,000. The management has appa-
rently been endeavoring to steer clear of all
doubtful risks, and total premiums last year,
exclusive of Life income, were only slightly
more than one-fifth of those for 1918. Here
is the co.’s amazing underwriting perform-
ance since its inception :

How policy-writing has been curtailed is
shown in this comparison of premium in-
come in each branch :—■

1921 .. 149,65-1 292,834 37,945
1922 .. 61,928 134,434 33,175
Expenses last year were not reduced in pro-
portion to the decreased business, so there
was a big rise in the cost rate. For 11121
losses and costs together represented 118.4
p.c. of net premiums, and for the past 12
months 146.5 p.c.. Each, of the three de-
partments was on the wrong side of the
ledger. This separates the business and
shows how the figures in the introductory
table were arrived at: —
Excess
Income. Claims. Expenses. Outgoings.
Fire . . £64,873 £53,235 £41,238 £29,600

Reserved for bad debts . . 23,000
Year’s total losses -. •• £134,930
The adverse run has resulted in big altera-
tions to the position of the co. as an under-
writer. Paid capital is £lOO,OOO, and after
providing for taxation and bad debts re-
serves total £338,997. That gives approxi-
mately £439,000 of funds, equal to 180 p.c.
of last year’s net premium income. Though
risky marine business is still the big line,
the co. is a much more sound underwriter
than it used to be. In the dark war-days it
undertook risks far beyond its resources.
Had the loss rate then been anything like
that of the past two years there would have
been many policy-holders seeking a dividend
from a liquidator, and Sam Copley. would
probably not have become a “Yorkshire mil-
lionaire.” With reasonable luck the co.
should still come through the wild gamble a
big winner, though there is no definite infor-
mation on that point: marine settlements
are often not finally adjusted for several
years. Other effects of the recent adverse run
are shown in this comparison of balance-sheet
figures, which also gives another view of the
astonishing growth of the co.: —

Shareholders have apparently had no div.
for the past two years.
The Westralian Insurance also runs a Life
department, which was subsidised with
£20.000 from other branches. So far, it is
a small affair. Last year renewal premiums
amounted to £3540, and first premiums (from
new policies assuring £37,700) £930. Claims
and surrenders took £5lO and exes. £2436.
Funds at June 30 amounted to £30,518.

Happenings in the Permanent office during
its last financial year illustrate in a very
practical manner one outstanding feature of
the public co. as a trustee. When the per-
sonal trustee becomes incapacitated or dies,
some time elapses before his clients’ or his
own affairs can be sorted out and re-adjusted
by a successor —perhaps someone the origi-
nal testator would not for a moment have
considered as a desirable trustee. Last year
the Permanent’s old manager, A. P. Bedford,
who had been with the co. since its incep-
tion 35 years ago, decided to retire owing to
ill-health: but there was no disturbance of
clients’ business. Other officers went up a
step, and they probably knew as much about
the details of estates and trusts as did their
old chief. In the public co. the affairs of
beneficiaries and others are under the watch-
ful eye of a number of men specially trained
for the work, and who have no outside inter-
ests to distract their attention from the de-
tails of trustee work, and even should
several of them drop out together there are
other specialists which a co. can call in at
short notice. These features, and the fact
that substantial cash guarantees are avail-
able to make good any loss of principal due
to negligence, misreading of instructions,
and worse, have helped the public cos. hand-
ling trusts to build up big connections. Ihe
estates handled bv the Permanent had a
book value of £7,528,83!* at September 30,
and that was an increase of more than half-
a-million for the year. The trust business
lias doubled in eight years.
Earnings and exes, for a number of years
are compared in this table: —

The net profit for the past 12 months was
£14,804, but £7OO was struck off the book
value of premises, reducing the property
item to a round £65,000. Incidentally, the
modern building which the co. erected for
its headquarters, and as an investment, was
completed in the days of much cheaper con-
struction costs and when city building sites
were less expensive. Latest profits were
almost double those of only four years ago,
but there have been exceptional contribu-
tions to earnings. The Permanent delays
collecting the first or corpus commission
charge —21 p.c. on up to £50,000 ; 1 p.c.
on the next £50,000; and 1 p.c. on the bal-
,ince _—until a trust becomes distributable.
The co. makes a special feature of this con-
cession, illustrating its application by show-
ing that a £20,000 estate earning £o P-c.
would be wholly intact at the close of 20
years, with the £5OO which the co. could have
taken on introduction having itself meantime
earned the full amount of the corpus com-
mission. The winding up of estates during
the past year, and collection of corpus com-
missions therefrom, was chiefly responsible
for the big additions to profits. This hap-
pening suggests that there will be some
sweet pickings in future from the large busi-
ness the co. has developed. The directors
lifted the div. rate three noints to 9 p.c., and
as £50,000 of the £llO.OOO paid capital is
transferred profit, old holders are now re-
ceiving 164 p.c. on their investment. The
co.’s own funds have been invested in this

This little three-year-old steamship co. the
only new public co. to enter the inter State
?rade during the past 30 ye-ars-is m serious
trouble. At the beginning prospects looked
bright, and besides finding employment foi
a number of vessels of its own co. char-
tered others. For the half-year ended March,
1921, a profit of £4250 was disclosed, and
an interim div. at the rate of 12 p.c.
paid. The next half only £1433 was eained.
Dull times had set in ; lack of cargo to cany,
combined with the high cost of: big
wages and heavy port charges, lesulted in
outgoings exceeding gross earnings of
£lBO,OOO by £37,595 for the past 12 months.
Other influences were at work, too ; the ship-
ping ring decided that there was no room
for the youngster, and though it was willing
to join the shipowners’ union the door was
shut on it until further notice. Competition
became more keen. The Patrick co. inaugu-
rated a weekly service to Melbourne and
Adelaide, leaving Sydney every I riday . the
combined cos. followed suit, and also endea-
vored to dispatch a boat the day before as
well. A regular service with the nor-west
Tas. ports was established, and for a time
the co. had this field to itself; later, two or
three other steamers called each week, and
the Patrick co. had to. withdraw owing to
lack of cargo. The next was a direct service
Sydney-Ulverstone (Tas.), and though there
was barely sufficient work for one steamer,
another co. began in direct opposition. Hobart
and Port Huon to Sydney and Brisbane was
the next venture, two steamers maintaining
a regular service every 10 days. A couple
of months later two other cos. decided that
they would also share this trade, sailings, as
a rule, being just ahead of the Patrick pro-
gramme. These incursions by the big con-
cerns could not have been profitable, but
they also had the effect of preventing the Pat-
rick co. making a profit.
Paid capital at September 30 was £89,961,
in "i 9 880 £1 ordinaries and 10,133 10 p.c. cum.
prefs. of £1 each, £52 of calls being unpaid.
Jlabilities amounted to no less than £<-.<<<,
£62,302 of which was bank overdraft. Ship-
ping property, including the s.s. Gabo, In-
dium, Duranbah, Norwest and the schooner
Abemama, all equipment, stores, etc., had a
book value of £115,603, but what they would
bring in the market —if there is a market —
is another matter. The only other assets are
book debts, unexpired premiums and other
odds and ends for £10,551. The immediate
future of the co. obviously depends on
the Bank, unless more capital can be
got in, and that is not likely. And in
the present condition of the market for ships
the bank has probably no. option except to
give the management a chance to recover.
A reconstruction is, of course, inevitable,
and in that process probably almost half the
ordinary capital will disappear.

This co. is doing better, but it is still a long
way from realising prospectus anticipations.
It holds world’s rights of the Premier totali-
satou, the invention of Sydney engineer
Julius, which, at first designed as an auto-
matic vote-counter for elections, is now in
active competition with bookmakers on Aus-
tralian courses. Machines are operating suc-
cessfully in four mainland States, but hopes
have been dashed in Vic. by Parliament hav-
ing recently turned down the bill which had
been introduced to legalise machine-betting
in that State. The promoters of the co.
thought that the Australian machine could
be introduced to other countries without
much difficulty, and onlv three years ago the
directors expressed the opinion that world’s
rights would bring more than the total
amount which had been paid for goodwill.
The extent of this intangible asset is not
visible in the published accounts —hence the
labelling of reserves as nominal in the intro-
ductory table—but “patent rights, models,
totalisators (Queensland and Perth), pre-
payments, etc.,” have a book value of
£176,955. So far the only installations out-
side the Commonwealth and Maoriland have
been two machines in Ceylon. Negotiations
are still proceeding in India and France, but
vested interests are very strong in the latter
country. A French syndicate has an option
over the rights expiring on Dec. 31. An
option for Argentine also expires on the
same date. The co. had visions of an Eng-
lish market, but so far the tote has not been
legalised there.
Increased local activity last year—the co.
has installed a ‘machine in Adelaide, and
increased the capacity of Sydney totes —r“-

suited in considerably improved profits. The
£10,547 disclosed was left after providing
£lll3 for depreciation and meeting all costs
of managing-director Bethel’s canvassing
abroad, but no allowance was made for tax-
ation. Handsome returns cannot be expected
unless world’s rights turn in cash to replace
the large goodwill asset. In other respects
the, co.’s position is comfortable enough. At
Oct. 31 all liabilities amounted to £0825, and
besides the big asset the accounts showed :
property, etc., £56,168; stocks, £5263; book
debts, £23,463; and deposits and cash,
£14,238. The large book debts represent
amounts due under agreements with racing
clubs, “the nature of which is such that a
very long period must necessarily elapse be-
fore payment can be expected.”

Christmas Gift, Cootamundra, one of the
very few N. S. Wales gold-mines which offers
much promise, has had little to show for
operations during the past 12 months.
Nevertheless, some sound development work
has been undertaken, and the show put in
order for future work. The shaft has been
re-timbered and enlarged to three compart-
ments down to 200 ft., the workings at that
level were timbered and old stopes filled with
mullock. The shaft is to go down to 300 ft.
and a level will go in to tap the continuation
of the large ore-bodies opened out in the
level above. Ore raising will be resumed
when the shaft sinking is completed, but
though values at 200 ft. will provide helpful
income the Gift’s future depends on happen-
ings in deeper ground, where, judging by the
behavior of the ore bodies higher up, there
are possibilities. The battery handled only
376 tons during the 12 months to October
31, but with £ll3l gold premium revenue
totalled £2203. Outgoings exceeded that by
£4450, and the P. and L. account is now in
debit £5823. The 60,000 10s. contribs. are
now paid to ss. 6d., and as the excess of all
liabilities over cash in hand was only £630
and there is £13,500 callable, the co.’s posi-
tion is comfortable.

Adelong Creek (N.S.W.) and its pup,
Adelong Estates, have run into poor ground.
The latter now works only one plant, the
other having its parts sold after foundering.
Its last return was for the October, 1921,
run, when it scraped up 47900 z. No. 2 got
rattling gold in the April term of this year,
as the output topped 71600 z. Then it got
into poor stuff, so that the last half-year’s
run only works out at 29860 z. from 350,549
c. yd. That meant a loss of £3062. Ahead
the plant will battle with better stuff, so the
chance is that its final effort will be to add
to the div. list. In spite of the reverse
the oo.’s liquid assets stand at £9530. and
liabilities at £2169, giving a surplus of £7361
to fall back upon should the wash not be as
good as is thought.

The Golden Hole, in 150 shares of £lO
each, 75 of which are offered the public and
the balance taken by vendors, is forming in
Sydney to probe the Devil’s Hole, Belubula
River, about 20 miles from Carcoar
(N.S.W.). For centuries the waters of the
Belubula Falls have worn the rocks
beneath, and the hole is now about 100 ft. by
SOft., with a depth of about 30ft. As the
watershed is auriferous, there is a local
legend that the Devil’s Hole is a “jeweller’s
shop.” The little co. now proposes to don
a diver’s dress to ascertain whether in the
Devil’s Hole Nature has provided a primi-
tive concentrator, which has collected colors
for centuries. The prospectus is honest
enough to say the venture is a “gamble.”

Herbert Phillips, who has had wide experi-
ence in mechanical treatment processes—for
many years he had the full responsibility
of dealing with the ore from the famous
Talisman mine (M.L.), and he has held a
similar position with Bendigo Amalgamated—
has investigated the Associated Extended
tin-mine at Emmaville (N.S.W.). He has
submitted a lengthy technical report as to
improved treatment processes to effect a
better recovery of the tin contents of the
wash and to reduce working costs. His gen-
eral conclusions are:—
You have three essentials for probable success:
large workable areas containing payable tin, plenty
of water, and scope for treatment plants which would
deal with large yardages. With good management
and the carrying out of the suggestions I have named
I have no hesitation in advising you that good profits
should he made with tin at or about the present value.
While I express this opinion I would emphasise the
point that the hope of making profits at all com-
mensurate with the extent of the holdings rests in a
vigorous treatment policy, with plants so designed as
to deal with the maximum yardage and to ensure a
good recovery.
Shareholders will shortly have an opportu-
nity to decide whether or not they will pro-
vide the wherewithal to make the suggested
alterations and additions to plant.

C. C. Currier claims to have discovered
oil traces in a bore near Tamworth
(N.S.W.), and now the Dun Gowan Oil Co.,
in 100,000 ss. shares, is forming to secure
funds for further drilling. The prospectus
admits that the proposition is “essentially
speculative,” but in the same sentence adds
that the “prospect of success is practically
assured.” “Comprehensive extracts and
reports” are stated to be available for in-
spection at the co.’s headquarters, but the
proper place for them is in the prospectus,
to substantiate the claims of the promoters.
Of the 80,000 shares to be issued, 30,000
fully-paids go to the vendors and promoter,
and the 50,000 offered the public are to be
paid 2s. 6d. on application and the balance
on allotment. The absence of independent
expert opinion of the geology of the area to
be attacked is a weakness of the Dun Gowan
prospectus. No promoter should be per-
mitted to seek cash from the public on
meagre information such as is provided in
this instance.

Brown’s Reward (W.A.) claims a bulk
assay of 4oz. in its open-cut, and shares rose
from 2s. to ss. in a few days. But the
wire from the mine-manager is not illuminat-
ing. Something might have been said as to
the width over which the samples were
taken. About 300 tons of ore are at grass
at the mine, and will be milled when a treat-
ment plant is available. High-grade ore
reserves are small, and it is difficult to fore-
cast whether a developmental policy will aug-
ment them. To date, the rtffne has been
pigrooted for the high-grade stuff, but now
that a co. has acquired the property more
systematic underground working can be ex-
pected.

Retaliation Reward has now a shaft and
three costeens exposing the reef to depths to
30ft. The average width of the reef is 7ft.,
and the average value an ounce. The woi’k-
ings are spread over a length of 350 ft., so
Retaliation appears to have good prospects of
a fine shoot of ore as regards length, width
and value.

Recently it was announced that Mutaoroo
had taken an option over the Gt. Victoria
mine, at Yilgarn (W.A.), but now a Kal-
goorlie syndicate claims to have secured the
option. The show is reckoned to have the
biggest low-grade deposit in the West. Some
years ago it was sampled by Gt. Boulder,
but the £lOO,OOO asked for the show was
considered prohibitive. Working conditions
were favorable then, and freights and cost
of mining supplies reasonable. Under exist-
ing conditions the proposition does not look
inviting.

From John H. Scotland, secretary of Ives
Reward (W.A.) :
The drivel of “O.B.” (B. 23/11/’22) re Ives Re-
ward is quite devoid of fact. The directors, who
collectively hold and pay calls on approximately
one-sixth of the contrib. shares, have simply pub-
lished the manager’s reports of development work,
with certified assay values; the results obtained from
ore crushed at the Government battery, and reports
by N. E. Giblin and A. .1. Hill on the nature and
values of lodes on the property ; and did not enlarge
thereon nor attempt to “blow” about the mine. The
co. applied for a loan in a statutory manner without
any “wheedling,” and, after inspection and report
by two prominent officials, the Minister readily
granted the loan, thereby confirming the directors’
opinion of the mine. One of the debenture-holdei s
sold to the company £2OOO worth of debentures for
£ 500. The remaining debenture-holders have not
received one penny, they pay their calls regularly on
the shares they hold, and have extended the time
for redemption of the debentures to 31st December,
1925, free of interest. The quantity of ore crushed
has been governed by two factors: (1) Ascertaining
the length and values of the shoot on the main lode
in the two levels, and treating only ore amenable to
treatment at the Government battery, and (2) the
co. has crushed all the ore possible in the time
allotted it for use of the battery.
To which “O.B.” replies:—
I blundered in saying that the debenture-holders
were getting the cash; it is the relatives of the
deceased vendor and the backers of the deceased
Vendor who are being paid off. The secretary states
that the co. has never blowed about its prospects.
The official whooping done to date would fill pages,
but 1 will give two unwarrantable instances by two
members of the present Board. In July, 1921, John
Williams and Dr. Russell presented a report of a
“thorough inspection” to shareholders, from which
the following extracts are taken: —
Values we saw from the borings of the north
and south faces of the main lode, 35ft. in width,
would average 25dwt. and 30dwt. respectively....
We have already exposed to a depth of 100 ft. in these
workings, approximately 42,000 tons of ore, which
should, on a very conservative estimate, yield a clear
profit of £32,142... .The results obtained from
work done on the Blue lode to date prove that it
is a mine within itself... .Grab samples of ore
taken by us from dumps on the mine gave the fol-
lowing assay values: No. 2 shaft, 2oz. sdwt; No. 3
shaft, loz. 9dwt.; No. 4 shaft, 2oz. lldwt.
Within a month of this “thorough inspection,” N.
E. Giblin independently reported as follows: “The
future of the property, as shown by developments
to date, would appear to hinge on subsequent devel-
opments on the main lode. Where exposed in the
crosscut at the 60ft. level the lode carries good
possibilities, but development work at this level is
limited.”
On April 3, 1922, the chairman of the Board, in
presenting the second annual report, congratulated
shareholders on the outlook. Yet on that date the
co. owed the vendors £7OOO and debenture-holders
£BOOO, and beyond plant, stores, tools, etc., valued
at £lBO, cash £2Bl, and a big wad of reserve
shares, it had no assets except some holes in the
ground on which, out of some £20,000 raked in
from the sale of shares and calls paid thereon,
only £6625 had been expended on development.
My conception of the property, formed after two
visits, is that it is a big, low-grade, patchy proposi-
tion which needs tons of money to prove, assuming
it is worth proving. To carry on in the present
hand-to-mouth way is suicidal, and many a better
mine than Ives Reward has been strangled by the
adoption of such a policy.

After having distributed £615,000 to
shareholders from £1,817,000 of tin won,
Tongkah Harbor paid no div. last year.
Records for the past three years have been
as follows: —
1920. 1921. 1922.
Dredged (c. yd.) 3,654,550 3,319,480 3,167,580
Oxide won (tons) 1,125 873 1,031
Average per yd.
(lb.) .. .. 0.689 0.589 0.729
Value of output.. £206,049 £97,497 £95,762
Average price
(per ton oxide) .. £lB3/4/5 £lll/12/- £92/17/8
A working profit of £209 was earned, and
£1075 was available from interest, but de-
preciation of plant and some oddments called
for £9278, and the net result was a loss of
£7989. That reduced the P. and L. credit
to £53,097. But £lO,OOO was transferred
from the reserve for stores and supplies, and
£2OB from a War Loan reserve, restoring
the P. and L. balance to £63,305. Working
results were a lot better than in 1920-21.
With 151,900 c yd. less ground dredged 158
tons more oxide was won. On the 1921
average price for oxide the difference would
not have amounted to much, but with
oxide at the 1920 rate Tongkah would
have made £93,000-odd more. Since
accounts were closed tin has been on the up-
grade, so Tongkah should be doing better.
Hard times do good by forcing savings, and
costs are now down to 5.889 d. per yd.
against 7.14 d. On the other hand, there has
been a lift of 0.43 d. a yard for sundry
charges. Even so, the 1.2 d. saved on
3.200,000 yd. gives a tidy sum. At the balance
the co. owed £7402, against which was tin ore
and debtors £9346, and cash £35,378. Only
four dredges were in commission on wash
last year. Part of the time the No. 2 dredge
was engaged cutting a boat channel under
the old concession agreement. No. 6 did the
best yardage, working in the deep waters of
Puket Sound and for most of the time in
fair ground. No. 3 plant had to be kept
close inshore, and, like No. 2, will need a
new hull whenever new ground to work can
be provided. The other two dredges have
been tearing into the Bang Tao flat, show-
ing a monthly output better than the nine
years’ average in Puket Sound. Tin won at
Bang Tao was worth £54,632, and working
costs of the two dredges £37,006. No less
than £8360 was paid away in royalties under
the agreement by which Tongkah acquired
the leases.

Bundi Tin is the latest off-shoot of the
Malaya Corp. The co. is in 85,000 £1
shares, of which 51,700 were offered and
fully subscribed. The Corp. gets 28,300
fully-paids and £6750 cash, but 12,000 of the
shares are to be passed on to the holders of
the mining concessions in Trengganu
(F.M.S.). The co. takes over an area of
approximately 2000 acres. W. B. Waring
and E. V. Peters overhauled the ground for
the Corp., and their belief is that, for a
start, there are in two valleys 400 acres of
workable ground averaging 24ft. deep, con-
taining between 15 and 16 million cubic yards
which will give 11,350 tons concentrates
worth 11 million with tin at £l6O London.
A conservative average for the whole area
bored is set down at 260 z. On these figures
there is about 15 years’ work assured for a
bucket dredge handling 90,000 c. yd. per
month. A tender for a dredge to cost
£38,750 and to be under steam in nine
months is under consideration by the direc-
tors. Later on other portions of the areas
will be tested to ascertain whether a second
plant would be justified.

Morning Star, Woods’ Point (Vic.), has
declared its sixth shilling div. for the year,
representing £lB,OOO. A much larger aggre-
gate than this was anticipated at one time,
but a strike of miners upset calculations. The
dissatisfied men were replaced by returned
soldiers, who had to be trained to the
stoping work. It is reported that they are now
breaking a satisfactory tonnage, and the
co. should put up a much better record for
1923. As far as can be judged at present
there will be three Victorian cos. in the run-
ning for pride of place in the div. list next
year: Morning Star, New Blue (Bendigo)
and Ajax (Daylesford).
* * * *
Alex. Peacock still says nice things about
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), although
it has gobbled up £177,569 in its working
account and not paid a div. Out or
paid-up capital of £211,055 the public has
had to fork out all except about £20,000 free
shares. It cannot be said that there have
not been chances of making good money out
of the market, and that and the faith of the
average Victorian in his deep-lead shows have
kept the mine open. Bill Toole has got past
the big bump in the reef, and off No. 1 rise
he has been cutting into wash giving 3oz.
samples. The gutter lias been entered oft
No. 2 rise, 200 ft. further south. There the
wash so far gives medium samples, but the
ground is heavy and has to drain before it
can be cut up sufficiently to tell whether the
run of good gold carries down the gutter from
No. 1 rise. Some panelling has been done
in the wash over the old north branch drive,
but with men in short supply and develop-
ment work backward, blocks of wash off
Nos. 3 and 4 rises were left to drain till the
lead could be proved south. An average of
30dwt. would pay, but there is too little dirt
available for the machine, so losses have to
go on. The co.’s boundary is half a mile
distant to the south, so there is still room
for a gamble if the grade happens to be in
the lead.
* * * »
Mt. Outhbert (Q.) working account shows
a loss of £4822 for the past six months.
Interest on bank overdraft and debentures
lifts that total to £8260, and raises the debit
at P. and L. to £177,782. For a modest copper
co. that is about a record. The drift went
on in the face of 9d. in calls having to be
forked out, but the probability is that live
shares have dwindled. No work has to be
done save baling and keeping the Kalkadoon
and Orphan in order. Manager Harris com-
ments : “Work at a profit, treating general
run of mine ore, is still an impossibility, and
it largely becomes a matter for serious con-
sideration as to whether it is advisable to
so mine your ores as to get a grade which
would enable work of a profitable nature to
be resumed. With a little preliminary pre-
paration and some alterations to plant to
deal with a smaller tonnage very consider-
able quantities of from 8 to 10 p.c. are avail-
able.” This means the discard of anything
under those grades, because once the select-
ing has been done the workings would be
left for ever. Such a policy is short-sighted.
Even if it should provide some work, profits
would only go to pay off the overdraft and
the bondholders. Such a policy not only
concerns shareholders and creditors; to pick
the eyes out of the mines and ruin them for
future work is a national matter.

“Fantome”: Re the new diving-dress re-
cently tried at Thursday Island. I can
assure “Bouragi” that not only has this
“rubber contraption” been used in 40
fathoms, but even down to 60 fathoms. I
had the luck to be oTi Thursday Island at
the time of the trials, and witnessed several
demonstrations personally. On one occasion
the Jap demonstrator reached 45 fathoms
in two minutes, remained there 20 minutes
and ascended in three minutes, bringing up
a basket of shell with him at the same time.
In this ma§k a diver swims to the bottom,
tides do not bother him, and I have seen
him literally running on the bottom against
the strong tides peculiar to that region.
Europeans, as well as native divers, men
who have never dived before, and even a
white woman, put on the mask, walked
straight over the side and down to the bottom
without experiencing any discomfort. It is
the absence of the “thick elastic air cushion”

that permits of the performance of
this apparent impossibility. The inven-
tor of the thing contends that by
equalising the pressure inside and out
of the body the diver, becomes relatively
indifferent to the great pressure of water,
this, of course, being accomplished by using
a powerful air compressor, on wh ch the air
pressure to the diver, controlled by a gauge,
is steadily increased according to the depth.
I may add that on this occasion my com-
panion was an English medical man, him-
self a diver, who was so interested in this
extraordinary performance that he has writ-
ten a short thesis on the subject for publica-
tion in an English medical journal.

“Yardley” on a point of dog psychology "
The sociabilities and hostilities of dogdom are
alike ignored by a bevy of terriers which journey
along Flinders-street extension, Melbourne, with
clockwork punctuality every morning. The cock
of their ears, the self-sufficient carriage of their
tails, their glowing eyes and general air of being
on business bent, all betray conviction that they
are a canine class apart, the elite of their kind, and
figures of importance in the community. One with
another, they are occasionally frolicsome in a re-
strained sort of way, but, being working dogs who
earn their food, they decline absolutely to recognise
the class of tyke that depends upon charity for board
and lodging. Certainly the dog that watches a lorry
is no drone, but even he is placed on a lower, more
servile plane by the dogs of whom I write. These
aristocrats are associated with a professional rat-
catcher. It is easy for human intelligence to esti-
mate the value to the world of the daily slaughter
by which they earn an honest and enjoyable liveli-
hood, but how do the dogs know it? There is not
the slightest doubt but that they do. No detach-
ment of Guards parading to the music of bands
could be more patently satisfied with themselves.

S.A. Supreme Court has been reconsider-
ing an odd case. The headmaster of a
country school was visited by a police officer,
and told that he would have to go to Adelaide,
where a young lady was waiting to identify
him as the father of her child. The p dice-
man travelled in the same train, but in
another compartment. When they got to
the city the girl said “Nothing like him,”
or words to that effect; on which the wrong-
fully-accused one claimed £99 damages for
“wrongful impriaijuiment,” and got £O9.
The question argued on appeal was whether
there had really been any “arrest, compul-
sion or restraint,” actual or moral. The
Court thought there had; the schoolmaster
had been morally compelled to make a jour-
ney against his will, and had been allowed to
go to his hotel only by a constable’s leave.
So the verdict of the jury stands good, and
it is legally settled that the walls of a com-
fortable pub can a prison make.

“Ring Bolt” winds up the “Village Black-
smith” controversy:—
The timber in the chair, mentioned by “10618”
(B. 23/11/’22), given to Longfellow’s family, 10
years ago, must have been rather green. Allow me
to pour out the dinkum oil. In 1878, Bumble, of
Cambridge (Mass.), U.S., wishing to widen Brattle-
street, decided to cut down an old horse-chestnut-tree
that stood in the way. Longfellow suggested that
the woodman should “spare that tree,” it being the
original “spreader” of his poem ; but Bumble, seldom
sentimental, was obdurate. Then it was proposed,
and carried, that the children of the public schools
should contribute their pence to make the poet a
chair out of the wood. The piece of furniture was
presented to him on his 72nd birthday, February 27,
1879. P.S. —About the end of 1917 a lady showed
me a chestnut from Longfellow’s tree,, received from
a Digger in Blighty. I gave her the strength of it,
and she hasn’t spoken to me since.

“Gippo”: The boss had told the new

“Lexite”: What divergent fortunes Fate
can hand out in three generations! A couple
who came to Australia 65 years ago had
eight children. There were, this year, 41
of those children’s children surviving. One
of them, a. bachelor, died and left his
estate for equal division amongst his
40 cousins. Orfe is a' well-known doc-
tor, another a barrister, a third, in
England, the wife of a baronet, a fourth
a film star in America. At the other end
of the scale are two laborers, a carter em-
ployed by a garbage contractor, a waitress
and a railway fettler. And an out-of-work
ex-Digger weighed in hungrily for his whack
with the rest. Besides those already placed
geographically one cousin is in Alaska, an-
other in India, and two in Maoriland: the
rest are still in Australia. The estate was
a sizeable affair originally, but the adminis-
trative expenses—or, in plainer English, oui-
old friend Costs —were so heavy that the
legatees pouch only about £4O apiece.

“Morehead’s” tale of an attempt at graft
that failed
Dauber, the undiscovered artist, lived, for the sake
of economy, in a tent in a Sydney seaside suburb.
The Council disliked Dauber’s al fresco Bohemianism
and ordered him to fold up his tent and steal away.
Then did Dauber turn his gaze upon the three
sitting aldermen of his ward. The first, a Stationer,
was an easy mark. A purchase of 30s. worth of
drawing-paper and crayons, and his support was won.
The second, who ran a hotel, vowed eternal
allegiance after Dauber and a crowd of pals, speci-
ally imported from town for the occasion, had drunk
his pub dry one Saturday afternoon. The third,
an elder of an obscure sect, frowned noon Dauber’s

second cocktail.”
“I know; and then coming home insists on kissing the taxi-driver.”
overtures at first, but promised his support upon the
artist offering to paint some scenery for a forth-
coming church concert. Dauber was given a free
hand in the painting of the scenery, but rashly
allowed temperament to overcome commonsense.
He depicted a Bacchanalian carousal with a host
of ecstatic females, dancing abandonedly—naked
and unashamed. The scenery was rushed along at
the last minute and erected before the approval of
the church was granted. When Dauber’s application
came before the next Council meeting an outraged
church elder made a rousing attack upon him and
his morals, the publican and stationer kept their
mouths shut, and the application was unanimously
sentenced to the w.p.b. He had to pawn his tent
to repay the graft-money borrowed with the object
of corrupting the stationer and the pub-keeper,
and in consequence is now a homeless as well as an
embittered genius.

“M.P.A.” (New York) : One of the most

The Hotel Graham, Castlereagh-street, oppo-

It was opened by the late Gustave Wangen-

continued as such until 1881, when Richmond
Thatcher, a Bohemian pressman, took it
over and ran it until 1885 as The Bulletin
Hotel. (The next licensee changed the name
to The Burlington.> Wangenheim was a

ping company took advantage of an immi-
gration loophole to try and bring in Chinese
by the thousand. The Chinks were coming
down the coast before the Government heard
about it. An order-in-council was promptly
issued declaring all Chinese ports infected
with disease. Instructions followed to land
the unwanted Asiatics on an island off the
coast, where they were held at shippers’ cost
till the company was glad to deport them.
Hodgkinson, in fact, quarantined the whole
Chinese Empire!

selling liquor to the members. He claimed,
however, that, the beer having been law-
fully bought by and for the club the pre-

among the owners. Any member could
have claimed a drink without payment, and
the actual fact that “each man, acting in a
spirit of fair play, paid his fair proportion,”
did not alter the position. The police
magistrate, in an elaborate judgment,
accepted this view, holding that the main
elements of a sale were 'absent; “there was
no contract as to price, and no proof of any

TRYING TO BE FUNNY.


THE HENRY LAWSON
MEMORIAL.
We have received the following:—
Town Hall, Sydney,
3/11/1922.
The Editor “The Bulletin,” Sydney.
Dear Sir, —At the last meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Henry Law-
son Memorial Fund it was decided that
the memorial should take the form of a
statue, and if sufficient funds are avail-
able also to provide a scholarship at the
Sydney University.
It was resolved that the Lord Mayoi
should open a fund, that the press be
asked to open their columns for sub-
scriptions, and that “The Bulletin” be
asked to open a special “Bulletin” Henry
Lawson Fund, ow r ing to that paper’s
association with Henry Lawson’s work,
and its unique circulation.
In pursuance of this resolution, the
Lord Mayor desires me to ask if you can
see your way to open a subscription
list in your columns. The Lord Mayor
feels that your help in this direction
w T ill materially assist the fund, and w 7 ill
be highly appreciated by the Executive
Committee.
Yours faithfully,
W. G. LAYTON,
Joint hon. sec. Henry Lawson Memorial
Fund.
Contributions should be addressed to The
Bulletin Office, Sydney, and endorsed
“Henry Lawson Memorial.”

“Lexite”: Even the police, who ought to
be used to anything, sometimes gasp at ti e
audacity of the modern Sydney tlnef. The
inhabitants of a suburban street gradually
awakened, the other day, to the fact that
every house which boasted a doormat had
been denuded of it. The Law, summoned in
haste, traced ail the stolen goods
neighboring streets, where no difficulty
had 8 been found in disposing of the plunder
cheaply. Further investigation showed that
the purchasers, in some cases, had been
robbed of other things beside the price ol
stolen property. Some, of these articles
were again recovered, from deluded
buyers, a little further off. And yet,
although the police were in one place a bare
half-hour behind the bandits, the scent was
already cold. # *
“Centurion,” still argumentative:
If “Tauwarra” (B. 7/12/’22) will assuage his
wrath in the usual manner arid read my par again
(B. 26/10/’22) he will see that I base my illiteracy
figures for Australia not on school age (5-15), but
on the statistics shown by the marriage register*.
These, as the “unchallengeable” Knibbs remarks, are
a much better index of - the truth, and they recoid
the Australian proportion of illiterates who marry,

you a belt on the car."
as 0.27 for 1915. The Scientific American Reference
Book gives the proportion of American illiterates
over 10 years of age, as 7.7 per cent, in 1910, but
it is hard to find figures about the Southern States
alone. As to mv knowledge of the “mean white
conditions in these States, I derived them from,
among other sources, a very detailed report bv the
Rockefeller Hookworm Commission, which mentions
that the mean white is so despised by white
and black alike that neither will associate with
him. This fact may account for his success in
keeping white, so extolled by “Tauwarra.” The
only mean whites I know of in the Mest Indies
are the Scottish-descended whites of Barbadoes.
Their ancestors were sent out as prisoners lo im-
plantations and the community has neither mixed
with the “free whites’’ or blacks of any description.
As to the South American “spiggotties,” they are
not whites at all, but mongrels of half-a-dozen
ULTIMATA.

strains. 1 am no advocate of a Black Australia, and,
as one who has spent a fair chunk of his life m
North Queensland and Papua, I know what the white
man can do in the tropics. In any case, many oi
the mean white centres I have referred to are not
in the tropics at all.
****
Are there any limits to the application of
the First Offenders Act? Apparently not,
in the minds of some Australian Judges, it
the following item (Brisbane Telegraph,
21/11/’22) is the whole truth and nothing
but it: —
Cairns, November 21.—1 n the Circuit Court yes-
terday, before Mr. Justice Blair, Charles Michael
McCloy, found guilty on a charge of rape, a halt-
caste girl being the complainant, was sentenced to
18 months’ imprisonment. Sentence was suspended
under the first offenders’ provision of the code.
There may have been weighty reasons for
the judicial clemency, but the First Offen-
ders Act has surely never been dragged into
a rape case before.
* * * *
“Karee”: “Eddyson’s” par on naked
bathers (B. 28/11/’22) reminds me. Wed
come down from Railhead to Serapeum on
the Canal for a dip, close on a thousand ot
us, when a little pinnace from Ismalia tied
un and the news went round that Edward
P.’was on board. We emerged en masse,
like Venus Anadyomene and in the same
costume, and lined up on the bank slope to
o-reet him. He shyly wended his regal way
up. and on reaching the top, made a speech,
in ' which he thanked us for our greeting,
wished he could join us, and wound up,
“There’s a lady on board. What—-er -about
returning to the water.” We did, and suie
enough a tab landed, who, I think, pin
poselv kept us swimming more than an hour,
capping away, before she accepted Bubbly
Rosenthal’s invitation to have something at
his officers’ mess. I am pleased to say that
some thirsty Digger had souvenired the
whole liquid contents thereof, while she was
admiring our swimming powers, but that s
another story.

“Retired Corporal” :—•
“One Who Ought to Know” (B. 23/11/ 22) finds
in the Fifth Army rout of ’lB an argument against
the quality of conscript troops. Doubtless it was—
in that case. After the tremendous losses of the
first two years England was left with a remnant oi
the old trained army, and posibly 50 per cent, of the
good voluntary men raised under the Kitchener
scheme. The Military Service Act armies were
very different stuff. Oil the other hand, the uniform
quality of the French troops throughout the war
might be cited in favor of compulsory methods.
That the women of Northern France exercised a
stimulating influence may be conceded, but it doesn t
supply the reason why the French man-power system
worked to its highest possible efficiency right through
the war. Is it an unfair inference that many years
acceptance of national service as the only rational
means of dealing with national necessity gave to
France the armies which, after all, were the back-
bone of the Western Front? Finally, Maoriland
raised her Expeditionary Force by the selective
draft. Will anyone contend that the M.L. men com-
pared unfavorably as a result?

“Helen Hadies”: A drover, who is a cross
between a Malay and an aboriginal, recently
arrived at Leonora (W.A.) from Carnarvon
with a mob of stock. On the cheque lie got.
badly and frequently shiekered, and, as is often
the way with half-breeds, smashed things up.
The police promptly shot him in, and the
Bench, after sentencing him to a term ot
imprisonment, proceeded to fine the publi-
can for supplying intoxicants to an abo-
riginal. After serving his time the
drover joined up with a local tribe
of nigs and acquired a gin. Getting more
liquor in one night he half killed the lady
and was once more arrested. This time he
was convicted not only of assault but ot
“eonsorfing with natives, not being an Aus-
tralian aborigine.” And now tbe Law is
scratching its head over an appeal. Either
the gentleman is a good Australian, and can t
get beer, but can have a lubra of his own,
or he isn’t an aboriginal, and can be served
with beer, but cannot consort with dusky
Helens. It’s rather an intriguing problem.
MONEY IN SCEPTICISM.
COHEN : “ Things is too bod this year ; I've
had to cut out presents altogether. Be-
sides, my daughter Rachel is a very
clever leedle gairl. SHE DONT'S PELIEVE
IN FATHER CHRITHMATH.”
“Gin Sling” on prohibition in Samoa: —
“Prof’s” and “X2X’s” pars in recent issues re
native brews in Samoa will bear revision. The
native Samoan does not do much in the banana or
pineapple line; it is too tedious a job for him,
but he does brew a beer that has a kick like a mule.
To get the kick he adds to the brew a yeast made
from cocoanut-juice. Another beer is made from
the pawpaw fruit. Care must be exercised, for
green fruit is dangerous on account of the arsenic
contained in it. The pineapple makes as good a
liqueur as one could wish for when experts have the
handling of it. However, most of the amateur brew-
ers are now using a malt-and-hops preparation made
in America and sold in tins. It furnishes a very
palatable mild beer; with yeast added, it will make
the hardest drinker sit up—or lie down. Now that,
good beer is so easily procured, the vile muck dis-
tilled by the Chows from cocoa-juice has slumped in
favor.
* * * *
“Kip” Bare-footed and round-rigged, lie
was engaged in holystoning the quarter-deck.
As he wore no badge, I gathered that he was
rated as an 0.5.; but, somehow, he didn’t look
the part. Ills sun-bored eyes, his hairy and
untattooed forearm, were more indicative of
a hard-fought existence among the mulga
than a life on the ocean wave; and I won-
dered what circumstance had propelled one
so unsuited to the R.A.N. Either the futility
of cleaning the already spotless teak or the
monotony of the work nailed on him, for,
with a grunt of disgust, lie drew himself up,
and gazed absently seawards. Presently,
however, he bent once more to his task.
“There’s one comfort, anyhow,” I heard him
mutter, “a man’ll soon have his mitts white
ernough ter get a job in Sydney !”

“Splinter”: Most Diggers lost heavily on
their speculation in A.1.F., Ltd., but there
were exceptions. One, who by no stretch of
Workeritis could be classed a capitalist be-
fore the war, was lucky enough to get home
after some three years’ service, just as the
Yanks were charging out of Washington. He
secured an island in a coastal river, and SO
nearby residents, caught up in a wave of en-
thusiasm, formed a gang to help him clear it.
In a day they felled the jungle on it, and
grubbed, ploughed and planted two acres
with potatoes. They didn’t have a horse,
but took turns in teams at pulling the
plough. The Digger wouldn’t take £7OOO for
that island to-day. Incidentally, had more
of that spirit prevailed among those who
didn’t go overseas, I know many Diggers who
wouldn’t be starving about the streets to-day.
BALLADE OP SUDDEN DEATH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now looms the dark and direful day,
The festival of knife and fork,
When worshipped are the laden tray
And the explosive champagne cork.
Pink piglings that will soon be pork,
Cheerful as though the world were Jew,
Prone in their pig-pen snore and snort.
This is the Farmyard’s Waterloo.
No thoughts of ruth the doom may stay ;
All heedless of the chicken’s squawk
And ruddier than the crimson day
Smiles the ensanguined tomahawk.
Fell Herods, whom no hand may baulk,
Slayers who deeds of carnage do,
Turn calves to veal as white as chalk.
This is the Farmyard’s Waterloo.
The geese go gaily on their way.
In swelling pomp the turkeys walk ;
While feathered belles are glad and gay,
Full boastfully the cockerels talk ;
And loud in challenge lift their raue-
Ous song and never wot eheu!
Death’s messengers about them stalk ;
This is the Farmyard’s Waterloo.

A wire from Darwin tells of the death of
David Lindsay, whose name will always be
linked with the interior of the continent
where he blazed so many trails and led the
way to big pastoral and mining develop-
ments. He was born at Goolwa (S. Aus.)
66 years ago, and started life as a surveyor.
A great Australian and the last of the big
explorers.
Premier Lawson, of Vic., rode the goat at
Castlemaine, a few days ago. It may be a
coincidence that McLean, his sec., has also

ternity. He is going to England with Law-
son, and both will take their cuffs, collars
and aprons with them.
The ladies should be delighted at the
appointment of Tim Healy as a Governor-
General. He w r as always their gallant
champion. Long ago, when the question first
arose of women

usual solemn M.P.
deprecated the
idea, as it might
lower the intellec-
tual standard of
the House. Tim

out with Lord John Russell, Prime Minister
of England, over some dispatch he carried
between London and Berlin, and had the
honor of a personal slanging from Queen Vic-
toria. After that he ran the Castle Hotel
in Windsor, and another near Brighton. He
brought his Windsor Castle manners and his
courier’s knowledge of languages to Australia
about 30 years ago. Happening to be in
Vienna with the Duke of Teck in 1866,
he fought against Germany in the war in

“Mr. Ocky”: Mrs. Harrison Lee, the tem-
perance lecturer, once in the Victorian
north told a yarn about a one-legged inebri-
ate who, witless through the demon
Beei-, had got stuck in the mud and
walked round and round his wooden stump
trying to free himself. To her amazement,
a one-legged man in the audience got up and
announced that the deplorable story was all
too true, and that he was the man. He
then and there gave a demonstration of how
he had walked around his leg. The audience
was in convulsions, for the man -was the late
Tom Angus (brother of the present Vic.
Assistant Minister for Water Supply) and
known locally as a persistent leg-puller.
Mrs. Lee, not knowing that this con-
firmed humorist was “putting one over
her,” apologised and confessed that she
had no idea that the yarn was true.
Nobody let on, and since then Mrs. Lee has
been telling audiences on the other side of
the world about the amazing coincidence.

Ernest Allnutt, a man who satisfactorily
synchronised the jobs of director of the S.

other day. He was born at Hamilton, Vic-

business career was associated with D. and
J. Fowler, Ltd., a firm of which he was the
Adelaide managing director at the finish. He
married a sister of J. K. Fowler, M.A., the
scholarly head of the concern. Allnutt was a
director of numerous cos., and was president
of the S.A. Chamber of Commerce in ’l7 and

“Lucius”: Unlike Jackson, of Tas. (B.
30/11/’22), Senator Bill Plain is no vocalist.
But his secretary, Edgar Fortescue, happens
to be one of Melbourne’s well-known warb-

fact handy. As Chief Pres, of the
Unnatural Federationists his meetings were
“lively,” and at a recent one he found it
impossible to get a hearing:. The principal
opposition came fi’om a burly Ilibeniian, and
when Bill’s Doric and Mike’s brogue met in
mid-air the clash was awful. In one of the
rare spells when the interjector paused to
collect oxygen, Plain thundered, “Look here,
Mike, I’ll make a bargain with you. If you
let me have my say, I’ll have your favorite
Irish ditty sung at the close of the meeting.”
Mike agreed, and put the hobbles on himself.
Plain kept his word, and at the close Foi--
tescue sang "The Dear Little Shamrock.” If
a poll had been taken that evening, Plain
would have got Mike’s vote.
Dropped dead at Grafton (X.S.W.), a
a few days ago, Alfred Herbert Parkes,
police magistrate and grand-nephew of
Henry. lie had been in the Northern
Rivers district for a couple of years, and
before that was Chief Clerk and Chamber
Magistrate at Sydney Central for a quarter
of a century. He died while picking flowers
in the gaol garden for his wife, who was
awaiting him outside in a car.
“Lexite”: Reference to the late Clement
Wragge’s habit of christening weather dis-
turbances (B. 14/12/’22), recalls that when
one storm was approaching which he de-
scribed as “erratic and variable, with winds
likely to blow from a new quarter at any
moment,” he named it “George Reid.”
“The Deacon” : Pius Xl.’s recent consis-
tory disposes of the hopes of Archbish.
Kelly’s admirers and backers for the Red
Hat. Eight new Cardinals were created—
four Italians and four outsiders, including
Father Ehrle, the German Librarian at the
Vatican. As a consistory is held only in
donkey’s years, the odds against the
Cathedral housing an Eminence in the near
future are as long as a street.
One of Newcastle’s (N.S.W.) most inter-
esting identities, John Limeburner, recently
passed out at 72. In his younger days he
followed the sea, and owned several small
trading vessels. He was at one time a mem-
ber of the Newcastle lifeboat crew, was
prominent in water sports, and was one of
the oldest members of the Coalopolis jockey
club. The name is not new to Australia, as
in the First Fleet came one John Limeburner,
“a guest” for seven years, who lived to be
104, and is buried in the cemetery of St.
John, at Ashfield, Sydney.
“T.W.”: Earle Page has an unobtrusive
otherself in Melbourne, who worked hard
in the Country Party’s interests through-
out the late struggle. This is Robert
Elliott, a young man whose methods in busi-
ness as well as politics are apt to puzzle the
old hands. He sits in a little room in Com-
merce House, surrounded by Orpen and
Augustus John canvases, and hangs out no
business sign of any kind. But he has quite
a big pull in Flinders-lane and other quarters
where the cheque-books count. Elliott made
his first, real rise by rescuing a tottering soft-
goods firm and then squatting on its roof,
and since then he has spread into the paper,
lime, estate-buying and other industries, one
of which involves the ownership of a whole
township. He is married to one of Fink’s
daughters, but the little Collins-street law-
yer’s busy fingers seem to have been kept
quite out of his pie.
“The Deacon” : After physicking the cookies
of Lismore (N.S.W.) and the Richmond
River generally for 20 years, Carlo Fran-
ceschi went out the other day. One-time
president of the Italian Club, he spent a
couple of years in Macquarie-street, Sydney,
but returned northwards again. He was
an ardent music-lover, and he did much
towards putting Lismore on the musical map.
Franceschi’s eldest daughter, Emma, though
Australian-born, inherited all the Italian in-
stincts of her x)arents, and her fine voice and
appearance were suggesting a distinguished
operatic career when the nark, Cupid, inter-
vened, and she married young Sullivan of
the Costs firm of Sullivan and McDermott.
“Thorold”: John Mathieson was one of
those who used to foregather with David
Syme, Croker and Fitzgibbon daily at lunch
(B. 7/12/’22) ; but that didn’t prevent
either Mathieson on Fitzgibbon from getting
frequent gruellings from David’s Age. One
day an Age scribe ventured into the then
railway chief’s headquarters after declaring
in print that Mathieson didn’t know any-
thing at all about a subject he ought to have
known right through, and he found the Scot
fuming. “Don’t know anything about it,
don’t I?” he snorted. “Let me tell you that
you’ll know something about it yourself when
Syme gets hold of you.” When the Age man
turned up at the office that afternoon he
asked in trepidation, “Did Mathieson have
lunch with Mr. Syme to-day?” “Oh, yes; but
you needn’t worry,” answered his grinning
chief. .“As a matter of fact he has stuck
another quid on to your screw.”
“Schnorrer”: If he can call himself Sir
Daniel Levy after the New Year, the N.S.W.
Speaker may let the chair go and seek a less
strenuous political life in the Uppish House
after next elections. Levy, who had a bril-
liant school and ’Varsity career, has a law
practice which he hates to neglect, and, more
and more recently, he has found his Speaker-
ship hampering it. But for the desire for
titular distinction, which is very strong in
Danny, he w r ould probably have let the chair
slide ere this.
The Eudunda (S.A.) Racing Club has
made an Australian record by appointing a
woman handicapper. Magdalen Gordon is
one of a family which does a lot of official
work in South Aus. racing, and claims to
know as much as any man about form.
The next Rhodes Scholarship for South
Australia goes to D. .T. R. Sumner, an
earnest student just taking his degree in
medicine at Adelaide ’Varsity, which he
reached by way of the State school in a
country town and scholarships in the Adel-
aide High School. He is prominent in the
Students’ Christian Union and such bodies, a
sound footballer and,, oarsman, and better
than that in tennis. Playing first single for
his ’Varsity, he beat both the Sydney under-
grads he met in the last match for the Niall
Cup.
"Harold Hardupp”; There is a wide mar-
gin between the reputation of a gifted scient-
ist, that the late Clement Wragge’s friends
sought to confer on him, and the reputation
as a crank he really did establish for him-
self with the man in the street. None the
less, there were many things besides his
meteorological activities that made him a
man of distinction. Although not an Aus-
tralian he knew more of the country than
PU per cent, of native-born residents, his idea
of taking a holiday being to go on the tramp
through the bushlands, beneath the open sky.
He scoffed at those who rushed in trains to
their holiday destinations. As a youth, Ber-
nard Ingleby, the erratic genius who has
written some of the weirdest and most strik-
mg verse published in Australia, but i s
now in the advertising business, sat at
Wragge’s feet as a disciple. Ingleby wa<
established for some time in the observatory
which Wragge built on Mount Kosciusko. *
“Thor”: Orpen did a portrait of Bland
Sutton, the surgeon who carved Kipling (R
30/11/’22) in his usual brutally truthful
style, and I suppose it was the first in
history that showed operating table and all
Sutton, a tubby personage not unlike Mel-
bourne’s old-timer, Thomas Fitzgerald, was
given the appearance of an affluent butcher
—like father, like son. Orpen never con-
ceals the warts:
his Academy por-
trait of Harry
Brittain, now a
British knight and
M.P., oozes self-
sufficiency from
every pore and in-
dicates importance
from top-hat to
gold-mounted walk-
ing-stick. If only
that forthright
painter dwelt in
Melbourne and had
the job of portrait-
ing the Lord
Mayors for the
Town Hall, the city
might eventually
lose its reputation
for humorlessness
and smug Bumble-
dom achieve its
knockout.

SAMMONS,

General in
Australia.
Zox, one-time Vic. legislator, famous for
his white waistcoat and an effective lisp,
accosted the late Alek Sass with: “Thay,
Thath,* do you know that you and I are
named in the Bible ath exthamples of
avarith?” “How do you make that out?”
said Sass. “Well,” explained Zox, “the
10th Commandment thays, ‘Thou thalt not
covet thy neighbor’s wife. .. .nor his Zox nor
his Sass.’ ”
George Shields, the husky-voiced optimist
who gave Teddy Wales a cheery welcome to
Launceston, has been made Mayor for the
third time. He is the first man for over “(»
years to get three terms. The last thrice-
mayor was the late Samuel .T. Sutton. Shields
is grand sec. of the Druids in the Speck.
Harold Morgan, one of the Newtown (Syd-
ney) aldermen, knows what it is to lia\*
re-election made easy. He was nominated
and shoved in while at sea on his way back
from a trip to America, and the ratepayers
told him about it by wireless. He has served
them for 32 years.
Supt. J. H. Martin, head of Vic. Police
Association, has, by the votes of his fellow J.
Hops, been placed on the Promotions Board,
lie will have to walk more warily than a
wire-treader in holding the balance between
the Department and his constituents, especi-
ally if he wants to succeed Nicholson as
Chief three years hence.
“Iford” from a Sassenach angle:—
Few people who saw Tim Healy in the ’eighties,
vehemence and excitability personified and explosive
as a packet of crackers, would have tipped him
as the likely first Governor-General of the Irish
Free State. Healy first began to qualify for his
job among the Home Rulers of the period who
assisted to make the House of Commons closure
rules the strictest in the world. In that congenial
work Joe Biggar, a retired pork butcher, was his
foremost coadjutor, and Joe’s stubbornness, assisted
by Tim’s craft and almost uncanny knowledge of
Parliamentary rules, were a formidable combination.
But I have a memory even more vivid of the open-
ing stages of the Parnell Commission in ’BB, with
Tim incessantly jumping up and interrupting and
drawing on himself rebukes, at first dignified and
then minatory, from Hannan, the President. There
can’t be many survivors of the Parnellites of the
’eighties who, according- to “Dagonet” Sims in one
of his Referee ditties of the period,
Cut- off the tails of the cow-s by nights
And won’t acknowledge the letters they writes—
left nowadays. And, except possibly Dillon, Healy
is the most notable of them. But he developed
into an anti-Parnellite after the event that split the
Home Rule party at Christmastide, 18&0, and of ail
the scornful invective that the deposed leader threw
at the followers who left him nothing was so con-
temptuously bitter as his reference to Timothy
Healy as one whom he had “picked out of the
gutter.” Still, even without a political hand from
Parnell, when Parnell was a dictator in Ireland,
Healy would have been bound to make a name
for himself; his legal gifts w-ere beyond question.
And law obviously was in the blood of him, for it
was a colleague of “Tiny Tim” (a Punch title
of later date) who once assured the House of Com-
mons that “the Healy family had been attorneys
for generations.” The new G.-G. has published
several books, among them “Why Ireland Is Not
Free.” Now that it is, it seems entirely appropriate
that he should be the figure-head of its freedom.
WHAT HAPPENED TO BROWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Brown was a very moral man,
Lank, virtuous, uncouth and lean;
He found the whole Creative Plan
Immoral, shameless and obscene.
Each Sunday he would celebrate
A week’s ways circumspectly trod,
Bewail all sin in Church and State,
And give a hint or two to God.
All merriment his soul did vex,
All humor found him at a loss,
And well he knew the thing called Sex
Cast grave discredit on his Joss.
.So clean his mind was, it is said,
So stainlessly his thoughts all ran,
That he would blush before a bed
Or at a newly-married man.
His young, slim sisters made him shy,
Since they were clearly girls; and then
So modest he, he’d turn and fly
Swift down the road to dodge a hen.
When first he heard a ship called “she”
It caused him such distressful pain,
That when he travelled, later, he
Preferred to patronise a train.
Sad that a man so holy should
Find virtue’s crown an irksome fit.
When saints throughout are not of wood,
Evil is sure to come of it.
Brown was among the pure well-famed,
None louder mourned o’er weaklings’ sins,
Until an erring housemaid named
Him father of her shameful twins.
No moral comes in here , save one:
A saint's a. man , all said and done.

HAROLD’S DILEMMA.
“ What’s this, Harold? Crying because a bee stung you?
Be a man!”
"Yes, and gel a licking for using a man’s language."
“Murkah'’; Recently an Accident-Coinci-
dence Stakes was run off' in the Abo. pages. The
second leg to my nomination hadn’t happened then.
Here it is now. John McKenzie, of Narrandera
(N.S.W.), w T as standing behind a horse when the

horse illustrating how it happened. The illustra-
tion was perfect to the last detail, except that this

“Kundip” : Re “M.F.” (B. 26/10/’22)
on God’s acre for birds. I have just returned from
a trip to the Fitzgerald River (W.A.), where I wa3
struck by some round holes in the soft rocky cliffs
overhanging the water. They were about 6in. in
diameter, bored straight into the cliff, and on exami-
nation I found them practically full of dead swal-
lows. The bodies w 7 ere in a good state of preserva-
tion and lay neatly packed one on top of another,
with the heads all towards the back of the tunnel.
There were two layers or stacks, one in front of
the other, with just room for about three more
bodies to fill the hole completely. 1 noticed the
same thing- at another place in the banks of the
river a few miles up from its mouth. In this case
the hole was in the clay just below the surface, and
about two feet above water level. Sick birds, as
“M.F.” says, seek seclusion to die, but can he
account for these bodies being stacked in such an
orderly fashion; and, further, can he tell me to
what sect they belong (the fact of there being only
one class of bird points to exclusiveness), as the
authorities of this God’s acre forgot to stick up
the usual notices?
* * * *
“20865”: We claim the “Drover’s Re-
cord” here (N.Q.). Two men, one a jackeroo, the
other a stockman, started off on a journey of 60-odd
miles to the railway with two bulls —and lost one.
“F.H.R.” : Contrary to general belief, there
is an hour when shearers’ cooks rest, and during it
I was having a snooze on my verandah bunk when
I dreamed of a battalion of swaggies pelting me
with empty tucker-bags. I awoke to find myself
being flicked with the wing of a very cheeky willy-
wagtail. Cautioning the bird not to bother about
keeping the flies off me, I rolled over again, but my
busy friend gave me no peace. This was so uncom
mon that I roused myself, and as soon as I sat up
Willy left me and attacked a full-grown black
snake on the floor at the foot of my bunk. Willy
knew he couldn’t handle a worm of that size, so
woke me up to give a hand. I’ve been called a liar
often enough to get used to it, but this is a true bill.

“Neel Kelly” : Contrary to the usual idea,
a broken neck is not instantly fatal. Once, while
hare-chasing near Cobargo (N.S.W.), my horse, a
four-year-old grey stallion, came down heavily at
a fence, and fell with his head doubled well under-
neath. We both got up, and as the prad seemed
O. K. I remounted and rode him for nearly four
hours after. Next day, when I looked at him he
seemed a bit sore, but otherwise all right; but the
second morning he was dead. A post-mortem showed
that his neck had been broken in two places.

“Noblow”: Records, is it? In 1912, when
over 50, F. G. Gulley, of Willunga (S.A.) pitched
on to a tabletop trolly 8 tons sdwt. of sheaved hav
in one hour and 45 minutes, and all but about one
ton of this was put over his head. Incidentally, it
was quite a common thing for him to put on from
seven to eight tons in two hours.

“Tom Pepper” : Re “Ned Iv.” on the intelli-
gence of half-bred and pure-bred dogs (B.
16/11/’22). Like human beings,. some have bright
intellects, others have not. Take sheep-dogls.
Some can never be tauahi, while
others require only a few lessons.
I know of a small English terrier
that could work a flock of sheep
with the best of them. I also
know of a kangaroo-dog (grey-
hound) who was an excellent re-
triever. This is how that came
about: When he was a little pup
his master, a rabbit-trapper, found
one evening, on returning to camp,
that the doglet had carried his
boots, socks, brush and comb, etc.,
outside. The youngster duly re-
ceived a walloping. Next evening
the things were again outside the
tent, so the trapper forcibly put
each article in turn in the pup’s
mouth and made him carry them
inside. The following day the
boots, socks, etc., were once more
scattered about the front of the
tent, but the pup, as soon as he
saw his master coming, started
to carry them in again, with
doggish expressions of jov. There-
after lie was easily taught to
bring anything required, and one
of. his accomplishments was to
deliver written messages.
“Pat B-ushie”: I’m with
“The Rumpus” (B. 30/11/’22)
when he says a fox will take
refuge in a hollow log. A friend
and I once chased (on horseback
with a good dog) a fine big fox,
which soon ran into a log. We
drove stakes in at each end,
imprisoning Reynard. Next day
I cut a fair-sized opening in the
centre of the log, and my friend
put his hand in, got it badly bitten, and with-
drew’ it quickly. The prisoner escaped. That’s how
I remember.
* * * *
“F.A.” : Many of the Knights of Matilda
in the old days were short of an active brain-cell
or two, due, no doubt, to days and day 3 alone on
the dry, hot march. One came up to me while I
w T as pulling wire out of an old fence. He was a big
cove with a bushy black face-mat and a thumping
big swag. “Got a day’s work, mate? - ’ As it was
a hot day and I felt like company, I said I had;
so he dropped Matilda. “I’ll snip the wires at the
strainer,” I said, “and you can pull them through.”
He went along to where the w’ires had been cut
already. “Take the top one,” I called as I snipped
it from the post. He grabbed the end and started
off at a run, pulling through about 40 posts—no light
pull. He dropped it and ran back for the next.
“There’s no hurry,” I said; “take it easy.” He
ignored the advice, and grabbing the next did the
A SHORT NIGHT.
“Why the devil didn’t you get up for breakfast?”
“Mine tinkit too soon after tea, boss."
same thing. This went on until the six wires were
pulled. He was just about done up. “I don’t want
you to go at it like that,” I explained. “You’ll
knock yourself about.” The batty one looked at
me wild-eyed for a second, then roared, “If you’re
such a blanky blank as to stop a bloke workin’
’ard when ’e wants ter, then I’m blanked if I’ll
work for yer!” He turned and set off across the
salt-bush heedless of my yells re his bluey, which
he left behind. I never saw him again.
“Durella”: Rc this drovers’ controversy
about lanterns and similar gadgets for quietening
cattle in camp. It’s simply a matter of psychology,
the : animal .and human varieties of which are closely
allied. It resolves itself into a question of atten-
tion and interest. A mob of warrigals newly on the
road spend the night on the qui vive. Any little
noise—such as the fall of a piece of bark, the snap-
ping of a twig, or a sudden snore from a dreaming
beast —and they’re up and away like a flash. It's
the suddenness of the noise that does the damage, not
the noise itself. All that is needed is to capture
and hold your mob’s attention. This is the reason
for lights round the camp, constant whistling by
the man on watch, and so forth. Give your bullock
something steady and constant to watch or listen
to, and, as he has room for only one idea at a time
under his curl, he won’t notice the silly little
sounds that would make him fizz on a silent camp.
“Murrangi” (B. 16/11 /’22) notwithstanding, this is
the. experience. of 90 per cent. of. cattle* drovers. I
have known a wild horde of “millumbri” kept to
earth by a car searchlight directed steadily on them.
The mob had its attention riveted on the concern
all night. A ring of fires is as good a# several extra
hands on watch. An even and continuous noise,
again,, is a sleep-provoker for man and beast. You
get an instance of it in the soporific effect of the
thudding of a ship's propellers. Droving, like every-
thing else, is only applied commonsense and natural
law.
* » » *
“O’D.”: The old cassowary at the Bris-
bane Gardens, who, before she came to live in the
city, used to be partial to a vegetarian diet varied
by small animals and reptiles, has developed a palate
for rats. She swallows them like oysters, and sits
up and asks for more.
“Picko”: “Murkah” (B. 7/12/’22) sug-
gests that mental heredity, doesn’t count where dogs
are concerned. Two instances: I’ve seen a kelpie
Pup, . five months Old,. removed from his birthplace
when a month old, round up and pen 100 fowls
without any orders, tuition or example, in the manner
of his mother or father when penning sheep. And
I’ve seen a cattle-dog pup brought up on a sheep
station, among sheep-dogs, that would not do as the
others did when driving the mob, and we had to tie
him up at the finish, because he insisted on diving
for the jumbucks’ hockg and nipping them as his
parents used to “heel” the cattle. While admitting
that training will do a lot to break a dog, whether
purebred or mongrel, from doing what it shouldn’t do,
or will teach some dogs to do what you want them
to do, I think “Murkah’s” point of view will be
turned down flat by the Council.
“Ophis” on a strange worm:—
He “Golub’s” (B. 30/11/'22) remarks on the new
snake at the Sydney Museum. 1 was shown, and
personally examined, the monster, and can therefore
write with authority. I agree that the crawler re-
sembles a giant brown snake (Diemenia textilis), as
it is brown all over the upper surface and creamy
white beneath; but it does not possess the measle-
like rash which is typical of the under surface of
that species. Color, or color-marking, does not
count for much in the making of a genus or species
in snakes. I can show “Colub” a black tiger-snake,
banded and various-colored brown snakes, and coppery-
colored specimens of the genus Pseudechis, the same
genus to which belongs the black snake. A genus
is established, firstly, on the comparative sizes and
disposition of the skull and jawbones, and the
number and arrangement of the tgeth, external charac-
ters being a secondary consideTStion —color practi-
cally no consideration at all. A species is founded
on the number of scales and sizes of the head-
shields, etc. ; color and color-pattern again being in
the far background. The skull of the new fellow
is very different to that of any other known Austra-
lian snake, and 1 never saw such fangs. Ilow
“Colub” can make any definite statement re, the
venom is beyond me, as I have been assured that it
has not yet been tested; but he is quite correct when
he says it is colubrine, and that there are no vipers
in our country. I was not told the name of the
HIS CROWDED LOT.
“Oh , Miss Pertowker, won’t you — won’t you
—share my lot ?”
“I would; bat, oh, dear, five girls and seven
boys are SUCH a lot,"
new snake, as I understand that it can’t be given
out until it first appears in a scientific journal. There
are several other different species of brown-colored
venomous snakes inhabiting- Cape York (Q.), and it is
well known that some of them attain lengths about
equal to that of the new one.

CALENDARS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When January crossed the floor
And dumped the New Year on our knees,
From each surrounding country store
There rained a perfect shower of these;
There was no tradesman near or far
But pressed on us a calendar.
Brave pictures from their wrappings rose,
The acme of the painter’s art:
Most splendid girls in classic pose
With lifted skirts and lips apart,
And lotus ponds and lion cubs,
And naked babies in their tubs.
The chemist favored purple trees
With thunder clouds above them bent;
An angel praying on her knees
Was what the ironmonger sent.
The seedsman’s was a 'flowering bean,
The blacksmith chose a hunting scene.
Our dearest friends were just as bad ;
With ardent zeal they posted off
Thick blocks that featured every fad,
From high-class literature to golf—
Browning and Tennyson and Yeats
Were quoted over large-type dates.
And now, with bright December here,
Where are those brave creations flown ?
Where is the butcher’s “Kiss Me, Dear,’’
And where the sweep’s “At last —Alone!’’?
1 cannot find one single plate
To serve me, dateless, with a' date.
No tradesman brings authentic word,
No single friend have I to say
If Friday be the twenty-third
Or Saturday the twelfth or nay.
Babes, angels, lovers —all are fled.
Aid dates are jumbled in mv bead.

“A.A.H.”: Curious that for the Queer
Accident Stakes no one has so far nominated a well-
known Tasmanian casualty. A man was walking
along the edge of the Cole River, with a scythe over
his shoulder, when he spotted a big fish under the
bank. He made a mighty jab at the fish, which
was later found impaled on the handle of the scythe.
Also,, the man’s head was found in the water some
distance down-stream, and his body on the bank
where he made the swipe.

“Dido”: McArthur was taking stud stock
out to Robbins’s place at the Nip, and came
upon the travellers camped by the pole bridge on
the Old Road. Rowe, the head of the family, was
busy grilling bacon on a twist of wire. Mrs. Rowe
was feeding a two-year-old with sopped bread. A
donkey-load of impedimenta was piled up on the
bridge. The hospitality of the bush was offered
McArthur, and he added a tin of salmon and a
loaf to the common lot. The party became quite
friendly before the meal was over, and even the deli-
cate question of Mrs. Rowe’s condition was touched
upon. Mrs. Rowe’s condition, to put it mildly,
was precarious. McArthur having explained that
he had five of his own, ventured to ask when the
little Rowe was expected. Rowe looked at his
watch. “Nine miles this side of Fowler’s Creek,”
said he.

“Centre”: There’s a fungus growing up
north which contains possibilities—and other things.
; Fleshy and -greenish-grey, it measures about 4in.
across, and grows on a thick stalk at the foot of
dead, standing timber. After watching an old bushie
ALL HE KNEW.
THE FIRST: “Is she good?”
THE SECOND: “Dunno! But she’s clever.”
pack away more than half-a-pan of the stuff, and
still live, I had a snap at what was left. It had
a flavor all its own, but was good. The after-
effects set me thinking, for Whiskers went to sleep
singing of home and mother, after swearing that I
was his long-lost son. The snack that I'd had
made me feel as though I’d been stopping quite
a few, though the following morning carried with
it no sign of head or furred tor.gue. If the fungus
is what it seems to be, there’s a fortune awaiting
the bloke who grows it and markets it as Australia’s
own wild-vegetable shikker.
GREEDY AUGUSTUS.
AUGUSTUS : “I haven’t seen much of Grade at the dances lately.”
THE CAT: “ Considering that she always comes in a flimsy, short , transparent frock, I
should think you have had opportunity of seeing quite enough of Grade!”
“Phoebus”: I have just heard of a case of
callous brutality that will take a lot of beating.
A cattle-dog killed a turkey which his owner was
rearing, whereupon the man tied the dog up by a
length of rope that kept him on his feet, and left
him in the full glare of the sun without water or
food until the poor tortured thing died. No one
was game enough to interfere or report the human
fiend to the authorities.

“Pick”: The Ishmael among Australian
birds is' the brown falcon of the highland plains.
Cruel and sneakisli in character, and practically
noiseless in flight, he assails any gathering of birds
with a fiendish ferocity and suddenness. Apparently,
too, like a dingo among a flock of lambs, his on-
slaughts are often for the joy of killing rather than
to stock his larder. He will tear ruthlessly through •
scurrying mobs Of parrots or starlings, leaving a
trail of feathers and falling victims in his wake,
and sail straight on-
ward without returning
to beg pardon or gather
up his slain. And not
only the scalps of small
birds hang at his licit.
He will bump' into a
magpie, crane Or black-
duck larger-bodied
than himself,- with an
impact that- bounces
both parties many
feet in the air; but he
appears to sustain no
dam’age by the colli-
sion, though his adver-
sary generally falls,
dead. His especial fancy
is teal, and a sports-
man may have several
shots at ducks on the
water before they will
rise if the falcons are
a-wing overhead.

“Pinnacle” i
Here’s a 6st. 71b. entry
for the Queer Accident
Stakes. Travelling with
cattle on “holey” coun-
try on the Old (East
Kimberley, W.A.), Bert
Lawford awoke one
morning at daylight to
find no one on watch
and no night horse tied
up. His “mild” queries
elicited no explanation
from the blacks, who
declared “You no more
bin call’ein”; and,
moreover, his mind
was quite blank. A
survey of the tracks
filled in the gaps in
his memory. On watch
himself, he had raced
after a beast, and his
horse had turned turtle,
smashing the tree -f
the saddle and pulling
a ltnce-pad clean off.
Lawford himself was
knocked out, but some
subconscious instinct took him straight to his blan-
kets unhurt. Myself and 14 keen-eyed boys followed
the obvious tracks.

“Billy T.” : Speaking of female miners. I
have seen women working on every field I have
visited. At Mt. William a woman had a creek
claim, and worked it with a puddling-tub, a cradle
and a dish. She could pan off a dish with any
roan. At Lefory a woman and her husband, Dan
Coy, worked a long sluice, putting a gravel hill
through to small purpose, and the woman did all
the picking And barrowing. I did not chip in till
after a week or so. Then I had a talk with the
lady, while shfe; was feeding the sluice. Her lord
and master on a spree. She complained
bitterly of Dan’s sprees. It was a crying shame to
leave all the work on her hands. “But what does
your husband do?” I asked, never having seen him
do anything. “Oh, Dan watches the water,” said
Mrs. Coy. For a long time an elderly woman
cradled slurry' in the creek at the foot of Black Hill,
Ballarat. An old digger friend had told her there
was a fortune to be- made there. She ended up in
the Benevolent Asylum, where she endeavored to pro-
mote a company for flic working of her claim. This
led to 15 inmates walking out in a body, all intent
on making their fortune in the creek slurry. In a
week they were promoter was dying, and
the claim was a proves?,- duffer.

“V.G.” : On my wfiy to work one mornrag;
—I am a humble hewer of hoop-pineal killed a
.goanna and left his fat on a recently-felled pine-
stump to be called for later. On my return one of
the lobes was missing, so I didn’t trouble about the
remaining one. It was not until a month later that
I used that track again, and on reaching the stump
I was astonished to see that where the fat had been
a new shoot had sprung out. As the pine invariably
dies to the root-ends when cut this happening should
suggest to a perplexed Forestry Department the solu-
tion to an old problem. I pass it on for what it's
worth.

“Jim Dandy”: “Naracoo’s bromide of
potassium as an antidote for strychnine (B. 2/11/’22)
is no doubt all right, but isn’t always handy. All
that is needed is a bit of charcoal from the camp-fire
or elsewhere, pulverised (not necessarily very fine),
dumped into a epp half-filled with water, stirred a
little, then poured down Towser’s throat. Result:
Instantaneous relief and complete recovery in less
than hnlf-an-hour. I have used this remedy many
times on both dogs and cats, and it has never yet
failed. Sometimes, when the violent convulsive fits
are on, it is necessary to sprag the jaws with a bit
of wood while you administer the dose.

“Moon E.”: In 1895 I was prospecting
in nor’-west of W.A., and, running short of water,
I followed a dry watercourse and tried several places
unsuccessfully for soaks. Then about 3' p.m. one
day the sight of birds gave me hope, and I was later
surprised to come upon a pool of beautiful fresh
water —about 2000 gallons. Having refreshed my-
self and the camels, I retired to the Scrub to camp,
congratulating myself on my immense good fortune.
At 8 o’clock next morning there was not a drop of
liquid in the hole. Weird feelings crept along my
spine. But I waited. In fact, I waited five days,
and each day at about 2 p.m. the water started to
make in the hole. It disappeared regularly at about
midnight. The spot was 200 miles from the coast
with ranges intervening, and the country was non-
volcanic. What was the explanation? ?

“Pat Bushie” : Re “Adrem” on wild birds
that will not take a second mate (B. 30/11/'22).
The magpie-goose of N. Queensland is one of these.
It marries young, and should the mate die or be
killed it remains for the rest of its life a solitary
widow or widower, as the case may be, and shuns
the company of other geese.
» » * *
“Aves”: In a paddock near Richmond
(N.S.W.) I struck what appeared to be a bundle
of squabbling crows. Stalking them up wind
through the trees, I brought my field-glasses to bear
from a short distance, and found they were having
a fine feed on what smelt like a very dead sheep.
A fight started and many crows were driven away;
then I was able to see that those left were feeding
on the masses of blowfly larvae in the carcase. I
decided then and there that the crow isn’t as black
ag he looks, and that he probably does a lot more
good than harm. He seems to be a natural enemy
of the blowfly, and the latter is the pest to be
afraid of. Kelly has to put up with many harsh
names, quite unearned by him, that really belong
to his black counterpart the raven (quite a distinct
species), a bird which, nine times out of ten, is the
culprit when man blames the crow.
* * * *
“Old Timer”: I can assure “D.F.” (B.
16/11/’22) that the platypus does hibeinate. I saw
two unearthed in winter. They were far above the
creek out of reach of flood’’ waters, and in a possie
connected with the stream by a tunnel. Their fur
was longer and thicker than usual, and they were
quite fat and warm —also very dopey. Ordinarily
they are very much alive. We covered them and
left them sleeping peacefully. But the platypus is
not an Australian exception; the porcupine also
hibernates. I have seen them unearthed from white-
ant nests. The entrance to their winter quarters is
well sealed by the white ants, so porky sleeps un-
molested till springtime, when it doesn’t take him
long to scratch his way out.
* * * *
“Durella” : As this is our annual Queens-
land season for declining waterholes and bogged
cattle, let me pass on to those Abos. who, like me,
will spend Christmas extricating the brutes, my in-
fallible method of procedure. Forget all you know
of using horses’ tails, Spanish windlasses and what
not, and simply peel off to the buff, descend into
the morass with a short switch, and place yourself
defiantly in front of a bogged beast. Taunt the
animal by tickling his nose with the switch, by
questioning his morality, his ancestry and his claim
to beauty, or any other means that may come into
your mind. This will impart to him the strength
of insanity, which, according to the alienists, is
about four times greater than normal, and he will
forthwith try to make your closer acquaintance.
Keep it up, and eventually you and a very mad bul-
lock will arrive at the bank of the waterhole. You
then miss a step, fall, and recover smartly. This
allows your beast to approach to within inches and
breathe blasts of fury upon your figure, thus nerving
both you and him for the final ascent up the bank.
On arrival at the top it is better to refuse to have
any more dealings with him, and, despite accumu-
lations of geats-head and nagura burr underfoot, be
firm, and leave him —with speed, if not dignity.
This method is dinkum,
“Dr. Nil” considers leg-pulling:—
Tell “Jim C'arew” (B. 30/11/’22) that when a
horse is “really pulling” there is more strain on his
hind; legs than on his front legs. Apes and very
young Human infants use their “front legs,” mainly
.in crawling and climbing, by pulling upon fixed
’ objects ahead of them. The muscles for these pur-
poses are, in the case of the ages; at least, as power-
ful as those of the hind limbs. With horses and
Other fast-moving quadrupeds the enormous pre-.
ponderarice of the hind-leg over the fore-leg in the
matter of muscularity can only indicate that these
animals have very much more power astern. The
condition of “really pulling” might be altered to
“really jumping,” or “really rearing.” I have seen
a prad hobble along with a broken fore-leg: never
with a broken hind-leg. To the heel of a horse is
attached the most powerful ligament in the body,
which can only have the purpose of taking the
greatest strain. The front legs of the vast majority
of four-footed animals are of most use as props to
support the body while it is being propelled by the
hind legs. In the kangaroo tribe they are quite
NO COMPLAINTS.
“Now, what does drink do for you? It
leaves you a terrible headache, a hor-
rible taste in your mouth and an awful
feeling of depression all over.”
“My word, this fella plurry glad ’e don’t
suffer same as you.”
useless and unused in rapid locomotion. True
some trained draught horses acquire the habit of
“digging in” with their front hoofs, hut that is
probably because, when the hamstring muscles are
in full strain for a dead pull, the weight of the
body requires to be thrown farther forward than
couid be done by “pulling” with the fore hoofs flat
on the ground and the legs straight. Where Nature
provides several times as much muscle in the hind
limbs as in the fore, you can bet those back leg's are
intended for the greater strain, and therefore sus-
tain it.

The Naldera, which reached these parts
a few days ago, had no cabins-de-luxe this
trip for the ordinary nabob. The Shah of
Persia was on board, and he wanted them
all, besides a whole deck to play on. The
mob got only fleeting glimpses of him till
the evening when the bottles of fruit salts,
etc., were presented for proficiency at potato-
racing and other accomplishments. The
young man—a very presentable young man
of 24 or 25, short, thick-set and with chubby
little hands—graciously consented to distri-
bute them. He speaks French well, but
knows no English and less Scotch, and if
the tall man from Glasgow or thereabouts
who bored him stiff with a long speech at
the start of the proceedings ever crosses
over from India to Teheran he will certainly
lose his head. After the boring the young
man told his interpreter what to say to the
bullboard champion and the others ; and he
got on quite well until the congregation rose
and sang “For lie’s a jolly good fellow.” At
the first “jolly good fellow,” which the inter-
preter turned into French for him, he smiled
broadly and bowed. When the interpreter
repeated the remark at the end of the second
line he smiled and bowed again. At the
third time he began to look puzzled ; and he
plainly hinted to his friend that the English
language is very poor in compliments. Then
he made a few remarks —in French—and
was borne off between two lines of flappers,
who gave it as their matured opinion that
he is too absolutely thrilling for anything.
But there was no crowd to meet the brown
dumpling from Teheran when he disembarked
at Bombay. That distinction was for an-
other and quite different sort of passenger—
our' late visitor Sastri. On board Sasti’i
spoke to hardly a soul except the two or
members of his party, and not much
or often to them. Anyone who wanted Sastri
—and nobody seemed to—had to dig him out
from a deep chair in some corner and from
behind a book. The flapper didn’t think he
was a bit thrilling.
When his Australian friends last heard
about him, shipping-man James Burns was
still passing in and out of the Park-lane
hospital which has Lord Dawson for its profes-
sional star. The patient—enlarged glands are
his trouble —has been pronounced too old for
an operation. He was lately well enough to
visit his and Australia’s old friend Lord
Novar (we knew him as G.-G. Alunro-
Ferguson) in Scotland. From there he, or,
rather, his nurse, took back an ancient gold
snuff-box of wonderful workmanship from
the Novar collection, and it will no
doubt go into the museum at Gowan
Brae, the Burns home outside Parra-
matta —a museum particularly rich in
South Sea curios. There is another
interesting gold trinket in the family; it
belongs to Commander Pearson, who married
one of the Burns girls and is now on the
retired list and settled in Surrey. Pearson
was on naval service in Russian waters
early in the war. and for some specially good
piece of work the late Czar presented him
with a cigarette case which turns collectors
green with envy.
Sydney’s former U.S.A. Consul Norton has
been promoted into the highest branch of the
Consular Service. His title now is Consul-
General at Large for Canada; and he lives
for nine months of the year in Washington.
During the other three months he loafs
through Canada, and generally has a good
time. There are only seven Consul-Generals
at Large in the U.S.A. service.
The peggy-bag lady being sold for the
benefit of the Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital had a christening the other day at the
Women’s Club. Mrs. F. G. Waley, who is
in charge of the affair, had a brain-wave, and
decided to call the smart little cretonne lass
“Alary Pumpkin,” after the David Jones’s
brand of sweets. The Women’s Club is pro-
verbially dry, but it ran to a sprinkle of
water on this occasion, and when the David
Jones people heard that they were god-
fathers, as it were, to the smart creature
they sent a cheque along to help with the
layette.
Sydney has had a kind of overflow party-
week. The gatherings were not so much in
thejnselves, but they were many. It seemed
as though everybody decided to get her little
bit idone before the Christmas trees were
upon them.
An early and, perhaps, the prettiest party
of the week was the dance organised by the
kind-hearted Scully sisters to help make
Christmas merry at the Royal Alexandra
Hospital for Children. The Scully girls
train quite half of Sydney’s da'ncing young-
sters in the latest thing in jazz, and it was
a ball for their small pupils that crammed
the Wentworth to overflowing. Of course,
everybody came in fancy dress, and Mother
Hubbard and old King Cole set up a great
friendship, while Mary had a little lamb
washed down by fruit-cup and embellished
with an ice-cream. One small two-year-old,
Eloise Wood, had her first glimpse of the
great white lights, and stood up to the ordeal
in pink muslin and forget-me-nots. There
were Cinderellas and Watteau gentlemen and
ladies; and there was a Powder-and-Patch
minuet that set Romance spinning, and one
waited breathlessly to hear the old-t me coach
draw up at the door with the runaway lovers
aboard. The McElhones were there, she in
cloth of gold and carrying a posy of many
colors. Mrs. Wilson, J.P., helped to cheer
up the gathering, as did Mrs. J. E. Daven-
port, who was the treasurer of an evening
that means a bulging stocking for every sick
kiddy on Christmas morning.
Assistant U.S.A. Consul Moseley turned
on a wonderful tea-party the other after-
noon at his flat at St. Roman’s, and you’d
have never guessed from the liquid refresh-
ment that lie represented a dry country.
All sorts of different cocktails supplied a
glow to go on with; and another feature of
the party was that every man present under
50 wore a toothbrush moustache. Gladys
Mason decorated a corner of the room, and
the Batliie pair from Brisbane were other
ornaments. Airs. Hugh Ward was there,
and several layers of good-looking young
women. Like a lot of assistant American
Consuls, Moseley is a bachelor.
Rupert Clarke and liis wife are back in
town, and are now planning a tour of Eng-
land and the Continent. She drove her own
car all the way to Melbourne for the Cup
festivities.
The “We Are Seven” kiddies had their
breaking-up in the ballroom of Government
House on Friday last. These youngsters are
Daphne and Diana Davidson and five of
their little friends, who have classes to-
gether every day at the Justice Gordon home
in Elizabeth Bay. Their teacher is Miss
Morphet, and it was she who staged the enter-
tainment of music and song that culminated
in “The Pied Piper,” recited by Anne Gor-
don and illustrated by tableaux of the hap-
penings in Hamelin. Anne, very tiny in
her green frock, declaimed with all the dra-
matic fervor of a youthful Siddons.
There was another prettily-told story of
King Midas, whose touch turned everything,
even liis little daughter, into gold, until he
repented and was able to turn them all back
again. The function finished up by her Ex.
reading the report, and Sir Wally handing
out the prizes. The ballroom was almost
filled with fond mothers and friends —the
fathers stayed mostly on the terrace without,
looking in to clap at the end of an item.
There were Rundles and Phillip Mortons and
Rutherfords, the Justice Gordon couple,
Gladys Mason and Mrs. Grossmith, also
Mrs. Swinson, who brought her mother, Mrs.
Griffiths, and son Ryder, now 14 and threat-
ening to be a golf world-beater.
Nearly 10 years ago Dorrie Ward was
engaged by Farmer’s to sing in their new
' tea-rooms. She
recently terminated
that engagement for
a permanent one of
a more domestic
sort, the other
party to the con-
tract being N. E.
Lewis, who is a
merchant in his
working hours, and
an active member of
the Mosman Musi-
cal Society. Dur-
ing the whole time
she was with
Farmer’s the good-
looking young
woman, except when
on her annual holi-
day, was never “off”
the programme.
The other day she once again helped the Alos-
man Musical Society with their production of
“The Belle of New York,” appearing as the
irresistible Violet Gray. She is specially in-
terested in the S.P.C.A., and local charities
get next call on her voice and acting ability.
Mrs. George Taylor, Sydney’s first woman
architect, returned by the Osterley, and im-
mediately the United Service Association
burst into joyous eating to celebrate the
event. Unfortunately the Association under-
estimated her popularity, for they engaged
Farmer’s smoke-room for the luncheon,
whereas only the Hippodrome could have shel-
tered the multitudes that clamored for the
privilege of buying food tickets. Before the
arrival of the guest of honor the sign “Full
House” was hung out, and it became even
betting as to whether the lady herself would
be turned away. However, her frocking got
below the belt of the Horatius who kept the
bridge, and he allowed the black georgette
with its overskirt of jet beads to pass unchal-
lenged. It is really a beautiful frock, and
saw the light first at the Royal Garden Party,
as did probably the fine string of pearls that
accompanied it.
Neutral Bay has been talking about the
way the girls of the Household Arts School
recently produced the operetta “Princess
Ju Ju”—a little show with quite a profes-
sional touch about it. Apart from the
nimble-witted youngsters whom she coached,
the whole credit goes to Elsie Pawley, an
exchange teacher from London. In addition
to her routine pedagogy, she taught music
at her school, and in the L.C.C. Evening In-
stitutes, is herself a silver medallist singer
as well as a ’cellist and pianist, has taken
principal operatic parts in large amateur
cos., and has produced several operettas in
London —so she brought some effective ex-
perience to Neutral Bay. Miss Pawley re
turns to England a few weeks hence, whereat
there is wailing among the budding Bern-
hardts of the Bay.
This is Dr. Thompson, the Randwick
practitioner who got £2OOO damages out of
the N. S. Wales branch of the B.M.A. last
week. He is an
advocate of lunacy
reform, and in the
course of a campaign
in this direction he
used harsh words
about the methods of
some doctors. Where-
upon the B.M.A. ex-
pelled him. His case
raises a question of
profound interest.
Has the B.M.A.
greater powers than
(say) the Union
Club? The commit-
tee of this institu-
tion is authorised by
the rules of the club
to expel a member for
certain social lapses
(going bankrupt, for example), but it can’t
order the members to cut the expelled one
afterwards, or decline to do business with
him. Until Dr. Thompson secured his ver-
dict the B.M.A. Council was under the im-
pression that it had greater powers than any
club committee. It is now understood to be
afflicted by carking doubts on the subject.
Eighteen queens, with their court ladies
and attendants and preceded by their glit-
tering heralds, swept in royal splendor
around the lawns of St. Vincent’s the other
evening, finally taking up their positions at the
foot of the dais from which her State Ex.
smiled effulgently upon them. The big Dar-
linghurst school has thrown itself feverishly
the last few weeks into a queen competition
for the benefit of the poor little kiddies in
the ’Loo. There was the Queen of Song, the
Queen of Flowers, the Queen of Night, the
Queen of the School and so on, and you
could cast as many votes as you liked for
your fancy at 3d. a time —just the prne of
that ice-cream you had dreamed of all the
afternoon, but that somehow in the end found
its way into the ballot-box not only because
you wanted your pet girl to win, but because
you remembered that every thrippence helped
to buy a toy or a cake for some hopeless
kiddie living in an oven-like tenement
about the feet of McElhone’s steps. Four
of the queens were crowned under the gaily-
colored electric bulbs that were strung like
ribbons of romance across the school grounds,
and Dame Margaret whispered, when plac-
ing the crowns at the correct angle, that she
felt quite embarrassed, never having been
in the presence of so much and such richly-
caparisoned royalty in her life. Gertrude
Concannon, from the Garcia School, and
knight Ben Fuller’s Joan ran neck-and-neck
for the bauble, each bringing in over £lOO
to the fund. Gwen Marcus, in trailing black
and silver draperies, was crowned Queen of
Night, and a small chick who handed up
a multi-colored bouquet to Dame Margaret
was hailed as Queen of Flowers. The grounds
were packed with parents and friends,
fathers, big brothers and boy cousins appa-
rently working up a wild enthusiasm over
the matter, which no doubt explains the
general apathy over the Federal elections.
A little bit of Sydney has been looking at
a reproduction in crystal of the Jubilee dia-
mond. The original belongs to an Indian
potentate, Sir Dorab Tata, who is visiting
these parts with a physician and secretary.
He isn’t in the least like an Indian potentate ;
he is short, rather thick-set, almost fair-
eomplexioned and grey-bearded, and talks
like a Professor of English Literature. Yet
he is no pundit: the Tatas are great bankers
and merchants, and this one runs on his own
account a few businesses that call for 50,000
workmen. Nobody knows what the Jubilee
gaud is worth: it may be half a million; _it
may be more. Apparently the best use its
owner can make of it is to keep it shut up
in a vault. Once he designed to have his
lady wear it at Buckingham Palace; but
when the insurance companies asked £lOOO
to cover the risks of a night’s outing, the
lady went without it. Probably anybody
who can supply its owner with a cure for
lumbago, and keep him free from his tor-
mentor for the rest of his days, will be given
the big, glassy incubus for a keepsake.
The new ferry Ivuttabul, like some golden-
shod Cinderella, slipped around the harbor
ways one night last week in the interests
of the sailor-boy; and the rosy-cheeked lad
from Devon, and the white-faced Liverpool
youths who haunt the gym. and common
room of the Rawson Institute are going to be
cheered by the lady’s night out. For aboard
her, bow to stern, were crowds of dancers
bound for Dixieland, whose ticket money
goes to swell the Dame Margaret appeal.
Her Ex. joined the ferry at the Tar-
onga Park wharf, where Mackenzie, the
general manager of the Ferries, gave
her the glad hand. A battalion of
Knoxes (they’re always on deck at an
Institute shivoo) and Miss Henderson formed
the vice-regal bodyguard. Madge Cox and
Rose Merivale, who secretaried the appeal,
wore smiles that threatened to extinguish
the electrics on the ferry. That constant
friend of the sailor-boy, Mrs. Arthur Scri-
vener, hostessed one of the largest and gay-
est parties of young things, and the Roland
Foster couple, who had charge of the musi-
cal programme, were others who helped to
nail the pennant “Success” to the mast.
Hugh Dixson laid the foundation-stone of
the first hospital for cancer patients in N. S.
Wales one afternoon last week. The hos-
pital is to form part of the building of the
Ryde Home for Incurables; and Hugh Dix-
son and his late wife made the work possible
by their gift of £20,000. He was helped in
his bricklaying job by his daughters, Mrs.
Keep and Mrs. Thornett, and afterwards the
committee of the home presented him with
a gold boomerang, the hint being the same,
no doubt, as the Biblical saying about the
casting of bread upon the waters.
Frank Morton’s story of “The Old Woman
Who Lived in a Shoe” continues to go well
in Farmer’s theatre. The children are de-
lightful : they sing all the good old nursery
rhymes in piping trebles, and are given manly
assistance by Old King Cole and Father
Christmas. The surprise of the afternoon
is the mince-pie that Old King Cole leaves
behind him in the toe of the shoe. When
that is opened out pops a small girl vvho
looks like a doll off a Christmas tree. There
is only one thing the kiddies looking on like
better, and that is the passing of Santa
Claus right through their midst, to take
notes of what each one wants more than
anything else in the world on Christmas
morning.
A Brisbane postscript:—
With the thermometer soaring away up in the
nineties, nearly 100 children of soldiers and sailors
whom the war orphaned or left with invalid fathers,
turned up at the Cricket Ground, where his Ex. cast
Christmas gifts among them, with the vigorous
assistance oi Capt. Hammond. About 400 mothers
perspired, beamed and applauded. Marquees were
filled with asters, cakes and tea, and after the
Governor’s speech the head of the Cameron clan arose
and said a piece. Next afternoon Major-General
Bruehe marched with his Ex. to Anzac Farm, where
music and Christmas presents and the cup that
steams were cheerfully intermixed. Nearly 40
patients at the Convalescent Home were grateful
for ties and shirts ere they feasted in the recreation
room.
,Dr. and Mrs. McDonnell have been entertaining
his Ex. at Toowoomba. Duchess Mary, who occupied
Government House for a week-end, joined Dr. and
Mrs. Glynn Connolly as Mrs. Lumley Hill’s dinner
guests at the Cecil before fleeing southward. Mrs.
Pamela Pitt Rivers went Melbournewards this week.
The Rutledge lady also speeds to the city on the
Yarra at the end of the month, and the Philp
lady, thanking her stars that the strike is “off,”
sailed for Maoriland by the Ulimaroa. Bobs Ricardo
is off to Sydney for Christmas, and Jean Dar-
vall thinks it will be cooler in Papua just now.
The aged horses, to whom Mrs. John Weinholt
plays fairy godmother with a Rest Home at Yeronga,
were benefited by a jumble sale the other day.
The ancient nags will be glad to know the debt on
their paddock has been considerably reduced.
Administrator Urquhart is down from the Northern
Territory to see his daughter Miriam, who married a
son of George Addison, the architect and black-and-
white artist. Folk are asking if Urquhart has found
any poems in the North, for he already has a slim
volume to his credit.
The Black and White Pierrots put on two of
Frank McDermott’s musical plays in the Albert Hall,
and got deluged with flowers and sweet-looking pack-
ages. McDermott is one of those modest souls who
couldn’t make a speech to save his life, but he can
compose tuneful music till further orders.
The committee of the Children’s Hospital at-homed
at the Bob Joyces’ this week. Tea on a lawn, with a
view of the river, was one of the attractions, and
Miss Lorrisch, of Beenleigh, who won the recent
“Princess competition,” scored a £2OO prize. From
a population of 2000 she extracted £5OO. Mrs.
Edgar Robinson collected the largest aggregate sum,
and her prize was £lOO, half of which she returned
for the benefit of the sick kiddies. There was a
good gathering of Society folk, and the hostess wore
black crepe de Chine, a sweet smile and a plumed
hat.

Mrs. Green’s ball is one of the annual
wonders .of Melbourne. Visitors begin to
crowd into the Town Hall at about
(5 o’clock, and they stay there en-
hanced till close on Cinderella time.
The stacks of gate money are duly divided
among various local charities. The exhi-
bition of dancing at these affairs is extraor-
dinary. Hundreds of children, each dressed
with the expense and exactitude of a society
belle or a prima donna, take their turn
at picturesque pirouetting. Babies of
three or four years have their innings first
and are bundled home to bed ; then others take
their places up through the ages to the
mature, assured young person in her ’teens.
Some of the youngsters appear in two or
three items, and, as they exhibit a new dress
in each, the bills for the clothing of these
butterflies must make what’s left of dad’s
hair stand up endwise. Mrs. Green’s
daughter, Florence, was organiser-in-chief
this year, and she floated about in flaring
skirts of black Spanish lace draped over
white embroidered with silver.
The Bill Tainsh couple—she used to he
Mina Moore, and lie was for years secretary
of Sydney’s Union Club —have returned from
a long sojourn in the harbor city. They have
bought Gowrie Park, at Healesville, a gor-
geous-gardened place near the golf links,
and are turning it into a guest home. There
was a housewarming t’other day. Fred
Newman played goff in pale-grey duds, with
a petunia garter woven in his socks. Ernie
Moore’s outfit was marvellously checked.
Gordon Allard wore one of the new low
necks when playing tennis, and Doug.
Hart and Fred Rayner were also resplend-
ently clad. Some sisters and wives graced
the croquet lawn, hut the mere feminine
clothes were put in the shade by the male
sartorial parade.
A picturesque house swarmed into the
Royal on Saturday to get a second helping
of “The Maid of the Mountains.” Two
boxes were crammed with the management’s
friends and relations, Flossie Wenman in an
artless blue frock inviting a roaming eye
to rest a moment on her, because she "ms
the only flare of color in the pen. Mrs.
Geoffrey Syme, whose appearances are now
so frequent as to be considered inevitable,
preened herself beside a line of robust chicks
in one of the upstairs enclosures. The
ranks of Sassiety in d.c. and stalls were
freely broken by incursions of blokes and
tarts, which is another awful example of
the onward march of democracy that will
have to be stemmed by raising the prices.
Gladys Moncrieff looked well in her effusive
Spanish trimmings with the crushed-rhubarb
tone of the stockings and the splashes of
pink in the effects above. But Nell Tayne
was the hit of the evening, and epicures
raised their glasses to her. Her dainty white
frock and high comb, contrasting with the
gaudy raiment elsewhere, made her look like
a narcissus in a field of red cabbage.
;The Cafe Splendid was besieged by petti-
chated poker-players the other afternoon,
who, at the instigation of Mrs. Barry Thomp-
son, dealt their cards for the Alfred Hospital
effuse, the takings being swelled by the sale
of sweets and other trifles. The gathering
feasted in the tea interval on ice-creams and
other special delicacies, the gift of the cafff
owners, who also lent Mrs. Thompson and
her fellow-workers the rooms. Mrs. Merson
Cooper, who blew in with a spiffing opera-
hag and gold pencil to he raffled for sweet
charity, smiled from under a ravishing hat.
while the Barry Thompson matron beamed
from the shade of her smartest wide-brimmed
headpiece. Bob Greig’s little wife was
busy with the poker chips, with the Pharez
Philips matron and her cheerful daughter,
Mrs. Teddy Davis.
, That remarkable old lady, Mrs. Henry
Dobson, was in Melbourne last week on her
way home from the Hague. “Home,” of
course, is Tasmania (Tasmania used to he
Van Dobson’s Land). She is the Austra-
lian president of the National Council of
Women, and every two years the heads meet
to exchange confidences about the women’s
movement. Their ambit is wide: they are
interested in everything that interests
woman, and when woman in one country
achieves anything legislatively all the other
Women in all the other places are sooled
on ro that quarry. Just at present Airs.
Dobson, who is Aunt Emily to a prodigious
number of nephews and nieces and grand-
nephews and grand-nieces, is .deeply inter-
ested in John Eyton, the husband of one of
her grandchildren. This young man, who
gave up an Indian Civil Service job to re-
turn to England and pursue literature, has
published a volume of short stories that is
attracting a lot of attention. There are
wild-animal tales better than any told since
the Jungle Books, and the yarns of Northern
India are wonderfully vivid.
Ethel Hook is back at the Tivoli, buoyed
up by some new clothes and a sense _of
superiority Being the sister of the divine
Clara Butt gives her moral support, and her
clothes are irreproachable. Particularly
enviable is a sheath gown of rosetta-pink
brocaded in gold ; it has a scarf of French
blue lace tethered to the left hip by a dia-
mond buckle.
Adolph Leibner’s widow lias taken her
friends bv surprise, and is introducing a new
husband. She and J. R. Oswald Smith were
married in Methodist-minister Iloban’s house
on November 18. They kept everybody in
the dark except her brotlier-in-law Saxon —
who was a witness. The lioneymooners
flitted away to their seaside house, but they
are now in Melbourne in a whirl of theatre-
parties and Christmas shopping. They settle
down at Chatswood, Berwick, early in the
year. The marriage represents the romance
revival of an old boy-and-girl friendship. He
belongs to Melbourne, but lias been round
the world several times and lias spent many
years abroad.
The recent Jewish Fair at St. Kilda was for
the Ukrainian Jewish Relief Fund. It may
have brought joy to a lot of little Ikey-
vitches and Solomonoffs, but because of it
thousands of mere goyas in Melbourne are
sounding the loud 5.0.5., and bewailing the
day Moses led the Chosen out of the Red
Sea. The chief sales consisted of powders
and scents, and ever since violent whiffs of
I’ompeia, Azurea, Frangipanni, Diahle and
others even more definite have been assault-
ing the suburban wayfarer at every turn.
The plague was only equalled in Melbourne
some time before the war, when an enter-
prising agent brought out several tons of
Kaiser Bill’s favorite perfume. It was
labelled “Lilac.” hut was strong enough _to
have been used in the manufacture of high
explosives. Free samples were scattered
round theatres and halls, and nose-blind
women fairly mopped them up. It was
said to have been William’s habit to order
this horror to be sprayed round the opera
house or theatre whenever he made a visit
to a show, and it certainly smelt like it.
The Victorian end of the Journalists’
Association cut new ice on Thursday, when
district-president R. W. Kenderdine spread
a festive luncheon for feminine members at
the Cafe Franqatelli. The Inky Wayfarers
fed sumptuously at a T-shaped board, which
carried a riot of pink and white floral effects.
Mrs. Vesta Allan, who edits the frilly side
of the dear old Argus and Australasian ;
Mrs. Osborne, of the Age; and Miss Chari-
wood, who has splashed ink ever since she
first used hairpins, adorned the top of the
table, with the president, Kenderdine;
general president, Davies; the general see.,
Pratt; and cheery little local sec., Michell.
Over the caft; noir the feminine side of
A.J.A. matters was weightily discussed. In
point of fact this was largely the reason for
the function, and there is now some talk
of making it an annual affair.
Rembrandt is responsible for this pictui’e
of Mrs. A. V. Iliskens, who lately stepped
into Mrs. George
Langridge’s place as
president of the
Women’s Hospital
Committee, a body
of which she has
been a very active
member for some
years. This ener-
getic matron, who is
the wife of the sec.
of the Moonee Val-
ley Race Club, is
one of the livPst
wires in all the
philanthropic acti-
vities of the Essen-
don district, and has
a remarkable record
of Red Cross and
other patriotic work
during the war—
thanks to her genius Tor organisation and
her unfailing readiness to shoulder even
more than her fair share of responsibilities
and hal’d work.
Marjorie Browne, the Scottish lassie who
became engaged to Herbert of the Officer
squatting clan during his last Blighty leave
from the trenches, was duly married to him
the other day at the Malvern Scotsbyterian
Kirk by ex-A.I.F. Chaplain Stewart Macrae.
The bride, handed over by Dr. Arthur Nan-
kivell, glode up the aisle in white crepe
draperies, and flew a bunch of white heather
from her girdle. Orange blossoms supported
the bridal tulle which veiled her golden
head, and pink carnations could be detected
in her bouquet. Miss Nell Officer played
a lone hand as bridesmaid, in a floral georg-
ette with ramifications of pink and blue
ribbon, the whole topped by a fawn hat
sporting flowers and blue and pink ribbon.
Maurice Officer was there to look after
his brother. After the knot-tying the
bride’s mother and her step-daughter, the
David Browne widow, hostessed a cheery
health-drinking at Wiltara, the latter’s Mal-
vern house, and the newly-weds finally van-
ished in a whirlwind of confetti to honey-
moon at Mornington, where the Woinarski
family put their bungalow at their disposal
Later on they will settle down on a Kerang
sheep acreage.
Gibson Young, who is to pilot the cham-
pion Malvern Tramways Band on its world
tour in 1924. is an Associate of the Royal
College of Music, Manchester, and was the
proud father of the Children’s Concert
Societies in that city and in Newcastle-on-
Tyne. When he returned to Vie., he became ex-
tension lecturer at the
’Varsity Con., talked
music to the Work-
ers’ Educational
Association, and
occasionally hand-
led a baton for the
I. a d y Northcote
Orchestra. These
days he is critic for
a metropolitan daily,
editor of a musical
monthly, buzzes
about on behalf of
the Music Week
scheme and Choral
Ass. of Vic., and has
further burnt his
organising genius at
both ends in an en-
deavor to make
crowds open their
hearts and heads in community songs. At
various periods he dashes away to adjudi-
cate at competitions, his last trip taking him
to Lismore, Katoomba (N.S.W.) and the
Bananaland capital. At Easter he will lend
an ear to the Launceston contest, and his
wife will choose the Best Tellers among the
elocutionists.
Pianist Natalie Dawson’s “Intimate Con-
cert” in the summer palace of the Oriental
was a friendly little affair. There was a
crowded house, which sat round small tables
and were comforted with tea and cake after
the show. Mrs. Jimmy Dyer blew in be-
tween events to hand a prize to eight-year-
old Gordon Mcßae, who already handles
the piano with a. masterly touch. Natalie,
in misty-black coverings with a fine
splash of red flowers on Her headpiece, de-
lighted with one-finely executed solo and
an encore, but otherwise was content to play
infantile duets with talented small per-
formers. Vera Patterson, L. Stewart, Kath-
leen Healey, Stella Richards and Cliff Keat
weighted the programme with warbles. The
guest of honor was Sister Marshall, who had
been brought from the Anzac Hostel to view
the scene from her cot, whereon she has
laid for years after hurting her spine in
lifting a wounded soldier in the war-zone.
Jennie Brenan’s mother sat nearby. The
Jimmy Dyers, Leslie Nelkins, Mrs. Quin-
nell and violinist Gertrude Healey, just
back from a Skalski tour, were among the
interested spectators.
Henry Weedon’s widow has sold Yarallali,
the lovely home her husband built alongside
the Botanical Gardens at South Yarra. She
is now flatting in Ivensington-road nearby.
This road, by the way, is largely infested
.by prominent doctors —mostly specialists.
Of course it is not good form for a specialist
to hang out a brass-plate or wave a red lamp
forninst his home. His ear or eye or throat
placard belongs to his Collins-street perch.
The Stradbrokes have gone to the lovely
Macedon cottage, and can there successfully
defy the heat. Macedon always offers a
cool mountain breeze in the evening, and
The Mount is a paradise of sweet-scented
gardens. The Earl motored across to the
Woodend side t’other day to distribute the
prizes at Clyde Girls’ Grammar School.
Clyde aims at being intensely practical as
well as swaggah, and a wonderfully-appointed
school kitchen has just been installed, in
which the girls work in teams for a week at
a time.
Lady Stradbroke says that the very
naicest people in England are using Austra-
lian slang and Aussie phrases since the
war. It is regarded as “smart.” The
Countess commented on this one evening in
the box at the King’s. She said she “under-
stood every word” of “The Sentimental
Bloke” through learning to speak Aussie in
England.
Ruffled eitizeus, who regard this town as
a place of matter-of-fact business, are won-
dering how the Christmas shopping plague
cau he exterminated. A good idea would be
to set up one huge temporary exhibition place
—get all the shops to take sections and booths
for their Christmas-toys display, and then
jointly hire a Pied Piper to lead all the
youngsters thither by an out-of-the-way path.
At present strings of excited children, cling-
ing together like supplejack in the bush,

After the average city man has fought his
wly foi an hour" or two through swarms o

Scrooge view of Christmas.
Mrs. Reggie Power and her step-mamma,
the Clarke lady, put up at Menzies for a
bout of Christmas shopping recently,
subsequently motored off with their bundles.
“Phyl” was dropped at her oEfle-
and the elder lady then tooted along the
Plains-road to Sydney.
Coming “back to Portland” in the recent
celebrations it seemed odd that of all t e
choice land the Plenty pioneers annexed in
those spacious days not a rood is m the hands
of their fairly numerous descendants to-day.
The Henty brothers built several mansion-
like homesteads. But the splendid stations,
Muntham, Merino Downs and th® rest ha\e
long since passed out of the family, btephen
Hentv’s palatial residence on I ortland Hai

was built by assigned convict labor, is now
a hotel for the gilded visitor on whom 1 oit-
land largely depends.
A send-off by the Gaud Mayor, a Cabinet
luncheon and a rally by the staff of the
Public Works Department made Frank
Clarke, Minister for Public AV oiks, as joy-
ous as a schoolboy on the two days before
he left by the Moldavia for Ins six months
trip. He is accompanied by Mrs. Clarke,
who keeps wonderfully young, pod their
second daughter, who will be l£ft in P ranee
for educational purposes.
Some gossip from Adelaide: —
What with inter-collegiate and inter-’varsity cricket,
Commem. and Comment, concerts, there has been a
hectic time for the parental appendages of small
boys at school and bigger ones at the ’Varsity.
The new Exes, watched the inter-collegiate match
as keenly as any youngster in the packed school
stands. Commem. was the orderly affair it lias been
ever since brushes between Chancellor Way and the
students put an extinguisher on the latter's exuber-
ance. The usual hasty exodus for the long vacation
has begun. Professor and Mrs. Darnley Naylor have
already gone to Tasmania and Prof. Mitchell and
his son and daughter sail for Colombo soon after
Christmas, taking Miss Darnley Naylor with them.
Itostrevor, once the Ross Reids’ home at Magill,
and the scene of much entertaining in the heyday
of the elder generation, is to go the way of Torrens
Park, the old Barr Smith home, and become a boys’
school. The Christian Brothel's have bought it, and
are going to evacuate their present buildings in
Wakefleld-street in its favor.
Gone West, Amy Lea, daughter of the late Dr.
Edward Lea, of Robe, whose home had been at the
South Australian for many years. Hers was a
generosity that does good by stealth —to individuals
rather than societies—and she never said “No” to
a deserving appeal.
One of the three diplomas of education awarded
at this year’s Commem. went to Miss F. Batchelor,
8.A., niece of the late Federal Minister and one of
the staff of the Teachers’ Training College. She is
the first of her sex to bag the honor at the ’Varsity.
Grace Watson, at one time on the staff of the
Liberal Union here, and before that with the
Women’s National League in Melb., has been elected
a councillor for the Borough of Islington (London).
She was the nominee of the Ratepayers’ Association,
and the Westminster Gazette says she has “Par-
liamentary ambitions.”
The Victoria League had had luck with its tea-
party for the Bridges. Both his Ex. and his lady
were hooked to go, but he got a sore throat at the
last moment, and as he was already pledged to give
the prizes at the High School jamboree in the Exhi-
bition in the evening, he couldn’t tackle two
speeches. So she went alone —in black, and a close-
fitting hat, with a swathe and drooping ends of
apricot—and 400 or so of the League’s members
(almost a full muster) turned up to meet her. J. R.
Baker was the League’s spokesman in welcoming her
Ex., and afterwards Miss Murray, in black with
touches of blue, took up a few League members for
a personal word with her, among them the Gordon
lady, Mrs. T. Barr Smith, Mrs. Angas, Mrs. Percival
Stow, and the League’s secretary, Miss Marryat.
Next day Lady Bridges opened a fete at Austral
Gardens in aid of the Lady Weigall Hospital at
Barmere, one of the soldier settlements.
Mrs. Dale, the Commonwealth’s woman representa-
tive at the Genoa meeting of the League of Nations,
wasn’t allowed much idle time during her two days
here. She was guest of honor at a party given by
the Women’s Non-party Assoc., and hostessed by
Mrs. Carlyle Mac Donnell, then went on to meet the
local executive of the League of Nations. Next day
there was another tea for her, given by her hostess,
Mrs. J, P. Morice, and in the evening she addressed
a public meeting.
The legacy of nearly £30,000 to the Adelaide
University, details of which were announced by the
Chancellor (Chief Justice Murray) at Commemoration
on Wednesday, is the latest benefaction of the open-
handed Simpson clan. It is a joint-bequest from
the late Mrs. A. M. Simpson and her sister, Miss
Keith Sheridan, to found a Chair of Medicine. The
A. M. Simpson library at the University was a
previous gift from the former donor. Other members
of the Simpson family have helped with their bounty
the Botanic Gardens, rifle shooting, the Soldiers’
Fund, the Children’s Hospital and a host of other
charities.

Five of the 10 winners at Canterbury
Park (N.S.W.) on Saturday were favorites. One of
them was Issue, a serviceable five-year-old by Padding-
ton-Wedding Present, who showed his heels to Colonel
North, Braille, Swift Shot and eight others in the
C.P. Handicap, l£ mile 100 yards. Another well-
hacked winner was the consistent Cabochon, and Be
Robert, who beat a poor field in the Hurdle, was
next in order of favoritism to the erratic Red Jay.
But the Tommies got a turn-up in the second divi-
sion of the Flying Handicap, in which Science
romped home lengths ahead of Cool Light and Linita.
There wasn’t a bob for either first or second. It is
alleged that 500 to 1 was vainly offered about
Science, but this is one of the stories Mcßook is
addicted to telling over the walnuts and the wine.
The favorite for Science’s race was Pagan Chief,
who went out at 5 to 4 on. He got away well and
was prominent to the turn, but finished feebly in
fourth place, whereupon those who had hacked
him for the Villiers Stakes at Randwick next Satur-
day felt like tearing up their tickets. It was after-
wards explained that the jockey had mislaid a
stirrup during the proceedings, and the son of
imported Chipilly was restored to favor. He looks
a decent sort of horse, and is likely to run an inter-
esting mile with 7st. 61b. So is the M.L. mare
Radiant Light with Bst. 41b. —in fact, the Maori-
landers regard her as a stone moral. Nevertheless,
The Bulletin's preference is for Oranian, who is
nicely handicapped with Bst., has won up the
straight and is improving with every race. And if
Erasmus (9st.) could be depended upon not to break
down or come in lame he would give them all trouble.
Horses that may be dangerous on the first day are
Girton Girl (Nursery), Acrodorus (Trial) and l)iTh-
ton, if started in the 10-furlong Holiday Handicap.
On paper Cymric (Bst. 31b.) looks the pick of the Sum-
mer Cup crowd, but if one could be sure that Prince
Sandy (7st. 101 b.) had recovered the lorm he showed
when he ran second to Laddie Blue in the 1921
Metropolitan, he would carry this writer’s confidence
and part of his immense fortune.

Sport, a minor Adelaide paper, has been
offering £5O in an open tipping competition for each
local race meeting. The entrance fee was a shilling
and the winner each time got the job of doing the tip-
ping for the paper for the next meeting. This was
held by the police to be a lottery. The paper said
it was a competition requiring skill, and a police
magistrate dismissed the charge. On appeal, the
Supreme Court said the same as the magistrate.
But it was a fairly close thing. The side-line of tip-
ping for the next meeting was apparently regarded
by the Law as a business engagement which might
fairly earn the amount given, and thus relieve the
whole transaction from condemnation as gambling.
* * * *
The Croweaters, after losing the toss
against N.S.W. in the first Sheffield Shield match of
this season, started not at all unpromisingly at
Adelaide. Bardsley and Collins put up 88 before
being separated, but after that three wickets went
pretty cheaply and four good men, including Macart-
ney the nonpareil, were out for 131. At this point,
however, all the sting seems to have gone out of
the home bowling, and the bat became as a leaping
sword. Taylor (159), Kippax (170), Hendry
(146) and Oldfield (118) had the time of their
lives, and the huge total of 786 was on the board
when the innings ended. Three bowlers got wickets
and four didn’t; A. Richardson’s 3, far the cheap-
est, cost 45 runs apiece. The S.A. wicketkeeper,
Bennett, deserves an appreciative line; he stumped
two centurions and there were but 17 sundries in
the gigantic score. The home side opened their :
staggering contract pluckily, and had put up 86
for the loss of one wicket at call of time on Saturday.
Rain prevented play on Monday, and when the printer
applied the closure the S.A. men were still struggling
to avert the humiliation of an innings defeat.
Melbourne ’Varsity, visiting Adelaide for ■
a cricket match, crushed the home side. They made 1
319 (Mitchell 75 and Craig 50) and 247 (Bailey 86
and Irvine 60). The Adelaide totals, of 174 and 56,
were remarkable only for one effort in each case;
L. T. Gunn carried his bat clean through the first
innings for 92 not out, and 1,. V. Renew, brother
of the international, was 24 not out in the disastrous
second attempt. Pellew, by the way, had to adjourn
during the match to go and take his law degree.
Jorgenson, of Melbourne, took 3 wickets for 21 and
5 for 24.-
* * * *
The only school cricket match in Adelaide
which attracts public interest. Saint Peter’s v. Prince
Alfred, went all one way this year; Saints won by
an innings and 38. They have won four times
running and 10 out of the last 14, before which
the two schools were exactly equal on the long
series going back to 1878. This game was iuterest-
ing as being the last of a long series of duels, in
all kinds of sport, between two unusually good
athletes, Lee, of S.P.S.C., and Krantz, of P.A.C. This
one was a triumph for Lee, who made 89 and toos
5 for 25 and 4 for 31.
* * * *
While Collins’s batsmen were knocking
the co\ er off' the ball in Adelaide some interesting
matches were played to a conclusion in Sydney.
St. George, thanks largely to L. Wall’s 7 for 50 —
wicket-keeper McCarthy helped him by catching
two and stumping another —i.ad 43 runs the better
of Western Suburbs. Waverley conquered Glebe by
an innings and 165. Slow-bowler O’Connor took
8 for 62, and 11. Savage, keeping wickets in Carter’s
place, stumped four, caught three, and never gave
a bye in either innings. Balms . n failed by 13 to top
Central Cumberland’s 299, although George Wheat-
ley (77) and Bert McCoy (GB> p..c on Izd for the
second wicket. Gordon’s 399 was too much for
Marrickville (191), and apart from Cohen (61) and
Datson (65) Sydney’s attempt to pass Paddington’s
211 was feeble. For Paddington the veteran M. A.
Noble got 5 for 53. He is still an admirable bowler.
Mcsman’s six-wickets’ win over Manly was chiefly
due to the trundling of ex-Bananalander Anderson
(5 for 31) and Hooker (5 for 34), and W. L.
Trererry’s double (43 and 41 not out). The
A.I.F. player is returning to form. For University
(138) against North Sydney (237) Garner scored 60
not out, and Hr. Flattery 33, but there were six
ducks. Petersham defeated Randwick by 7 wickets.
Waverley, last year’s premiers, are again on top
with 17 points, followed by Gordon, North Sydney
and Mosman (16 each), Balmain (15) and Central
Cumberland (14).
*.* # *
The bright, spot in the M.C.C. Xl’s 350 v.
Auckland (M.L.) was the batting of little Titch-
marsh. He collected 154 before being bowled by
A. H. Anthony. Maciaren hit up 58, Wilkinson
50 (run out) and Lowry 29; but Chapman failed
to get going. Anthony, the best all-rounder in M.L.,
gathered the excellent bag of six for 43. Auckland
had 116 for 5 wickets when the deluge came down
and suspended the proceedings. Four of the five
wickets were credited to Brand, who is keeping up
the good form he showed at Sydney.
Last week’s anticipations regarding the
result of the ’Wood-’Roy engagement in Melbourne
were realised on Saturday, when Liddicut, the Fitz-
roy all-rounder, increased his score from 26 to 108,
and with the help of Lansdown (38) achieved a win
by 98. Collingwood tried seven bowlers, and Ryder
did best —4 for 60. The addition of Armstrong didn’t
improve the stocks of M.C.C., whose total of 138
was wiped off by P’ran with six wickets to spare.
University licked Carlton by 74, Craig, of the
students, carrying out his bat for 52. Truman (5
for 46) and Philpott, a popular fancy for bigger
honors, who knocked over 4 for 76, delivered the
brunt of the Carlton attack. St. Itilda, who beat
Northcote by 70, suffered most from the bowling
of E. L. Carroll (5 for 36), and the good wicket-
keeping of Halfpenny, who stumped two and caught
one. Hartkopf (2 for 50) was not as deadly as usual.
Richmond, who got over two centuries ahead of
Hawthorn East’s 122, owed their triumph to Pod-
more (96), Richardson (71) and Clive Sindrey
(57). Facing North once more South were afflicted
with the previous Saturday’s paralysis, or the bowl-
ing was too good, for they failed again in their
second hits for 84, Woodfuli (22 n. 0.) and Leonard
A. P. FREEMAN, the googlie howler with
Maclaren’s team.
(29) alone reaching double figures. Matthews, whose
bowling tally was 4 tor 10, finished up with the
fine average for the match of 11 for 49. North,
given 76 for an outright win, scored the needful
with the loss of six wickets, but their crawl to
victory was not exhilarating.
“Tren” : A rising star is Harry Philpott, the
18-year-old Carlton (Vie.) bowler. His only perform-
ance of note until this year was 4 wickets for 32
runs for Scotch against Wesley College in 1920.
Then for two seasons he played with a junior team
in non-competitive matches, and at the beginning of
the present season he joined up with Carlton, was
given a chance with the first XI, and sucteeded at
once. In his first match, against Richmond, he took
1 wicket for 37 ; against North Melbourne 5 for 39 ;
against the leaders, Fitzroy, 5 for 74 ; and against
Uni. 4 for 76. Now he has been chosen to practise
with the Victorian team, and is sure to get his
(hanee with the colts. Last year young Woodfull
stepped from the Maryborough Public Service team
straight into the Vic. colts’ XI, but he had a country
batting average for 1920-21 of 195 ; and for half the
1921-22 season of 482. lie proved an immediate suc-
cess in his new company, too, for he scored 169 not
out against the S. Aus. colts and 227 not out against
the N.S.W. second eleven in his first two knocks,
and is now a fixture in the Vic. XI. Should Philpott
succeed with the ball as Woodfull has with the bat,
he can pack his trunk for England, for first-class
bowlers have never been so scarce as they are to-day.
* * * *
“Winkle”: Cricketers who, like Victor
Trumper and Ranji of old, can adapt themselves to
a drying wicket are uncommonly few. Perhaps
the best Victorian was Jack Worrall. I recall his
wonderful innings against N.S.W. in 1898. Johnnie
made 103 out of 187, the only other Vic. batsmen
to reach double figures being Charlie McLeod and
Harry Stuckey, 31 each. Newell, pressed into the
N. s'. Wales side because of the absence of Ferris,
took 8 wickets for 56. Nowadays, an innings of
this kind is never seen, and the reason is that pen-
i ant cricketers will not practise on bad wickets.
They excuse themselves from attending the nets by
saying that the curator doesn’t like his turf cut
about, or, if they are honest, that it is a silly and
dangerous business to stand up to a kicking ball
when there is no need. The consequence is that
not one in a hundred is a good man on a bad wicket.
“Tren” : Fifty years ago there was great
rivalry between “Bailer” O’Brien, of the Collingwood
Swamp, and “Drive” Ross from the Richmond pad-
dock, for one or the other of them was the cham-
pion cricketer of his class. Even when they retired
from the game neither of them could claim the
crown, for though “Bailer” had been the slightly
better bowler, “Drive” had been a little better
batsman. Recently, to celebrate the Irishman’s 75th
birthday, both old fellows and all who were left of
the old crowd met at the Cricketers’ Arms, and the
almost-forgotten arguments were thrashed out anew.
The air was full of Ross’s hundreds and O’Brien’s
hat tricks. Then it was suggested that a single-
handed game would decided the question for ever,
and while the beer was moist they made their
wagers and hobbled across the road to the cricket
ground. “Drive” went in first and managed, during
many overs, to score seven. Then “Bailer,” in a last
desperate effort, bowled him, collapsed from exhaus-
tion, and, after an interval at the hotel, had to
admit that he was too ill to bat. It was then de-
cided that his old adversary had but to bowl the
wicket down to win. So “Bailer” lay alone in
the bar parlor, and was cursing his old age and
infirmity when his friends rushed back shouting,
“We knew you’d win! He’s bowled eight wides.”
* V * *
“Bail” : The English, who fretted over the
berserk manner in which the Australians played
tennis in England, are still throwing up their hands
in old-fashioned horror at the earnestness of our
fellows at cricket. Neville Cardus, of the Man-
chester Guardian, who has written a chatty cricket
book full of good writing and good stories, mentions
mournfully that our men “are putting into the game
a gfimness that hardens the sunny nature of it.”
Then he goes on to say: “Did ever a cricketer get
so much antagonism into cricket as McDonald, the
Australian fast bowler, got into his bowling at Trent
Bridge? His face was set to a quite pained grim-
ness-—a man in battle itself could wear no aspect
more formidable.” It is quite clear from this that,
though McDonald might have been playing to get
the other fellow out, it was extremely bad form to
reveal his evil intention.
“Abbot Park”: Jack Blackkam was the
prince of wicketkeepers, but did he always stand
up to fast bowling? I have read an interview in
which he was alleged to have said that “we stood
up to everything in my time.” But the official
report of the 1884 Australian Eleven tour states that
in a match against the Gentlemen at the Oval “Spof-
forth bowled his fastest and Blackham stood back.”
An account of the famous Test match of 1882 affirms
that “Spofforth’s first overs were fast, and Black-
ham stood back while Grace was batting, but crept
up for Hornby.” Anyhow, where is the sense in
standing up close to hurricane bowlers? In Black-
ham’s own case he was once hit on the chest by
Allan, a slow bowler, and was laid up for a week.
That was in the ’seventies, and in that 1884 tour
one of Spofforth’s landed him on the face, and
Murdoch had to don the gloves. If these mishaps
came along with Allan and similar bowlers, how
world a ’keeper fare who tried to “take” Gregory
or McDonald from the customary position?
S. McGorm, of Sandhurst, surprised Vic.
connoisseurs of rowing by lifting the champion sculls
from the Richmond crack, J. Barton, on the Yarra.
McGorm, untroubled by Barton’s reputation, paddled
home briskly, six lengths to the good. J. C. Hardy, of
Footscray, kept respectfully in the rear of the
other two. Though Mercantile had to change their
crew for the eights, they were never pushed by Uni-
versity and Albert Park. From the starting pistol
they showed they had pressing business at the other
end of the course. University and A. Park had the
same urgency, but not the same will, and the final
gaps of four lengths between Mercs, and the stu-
dents, and three more separating the latter from
Park, were practically unaltered for the greater
part of the procession.
* * * *
“K.E.”: The day before Mercantile beat
Uni. for the Vic. eight-oar championship they lost
their No. 5 through a poisoned hand. Boniwell
< hanged from 4 to 5, and Harding, who hadn’t rowed
since Henley-on-the-Yarra, took No. 4 seat. McGorm,
the Bendigo youth, who accounted for Barton, the
sculler, did all his training on a half-mile pond.
He was a novice until three weeks ago, when he
won his maiden and junior sculls at the first try. He
has the grit of a Bill Beach, and, when he acquires
the finer points of the game, he will trouble Bull
and Baynes.
* * * *
South Aus. does not suffer from over-
centralisation in rowing, at any rate. The city
clubs are getting quite used to being dominated
by Murray Bridge; and now the outports and other
crews from the river, are taking a hand. In the
recent competitions at Port Adelaide, Murray Bridge
won the cnampion fours of the State for the 7th
year in succession, only one crew opposing them;
and this in spite of salt water and rougher weather
than they get when at home. The junior eights of
S.A. were won easily by Port Pirie, from two Adel-
aide boats.
“Adrem” : The edict has gone forth in
M.L. that the crawl and trudgeon strokes are not
to be taught to school-children under pain of the
withdrawal of the capitation grant. A P.T. instruc-
tor has discovered "that these strokes tend to pro-
duce curvature of the spine, and it is alleged that
Ur. Truby King supports the theory. On tne other
hand, Dr. Chappell, a recognised world’s authority,
considers that the bi-lateral exercise of the crawl
and trudgeon strokes is a corrective of any tendency
toward spinal curvature, and that if any swimming
stroke could possibly be accused of this fault it
is the old English side-stroke. The M.L. schools
will never be nurseries of rivals to the U.S. cham-
pions while the ordinance remains in force.
* * * *
When Bradley whipped Sid Godfrey, all
Queensland expected that the lightweight belt
would soon be among his portable possessions. But
the Gympie youth has grown out of the 9st. 91b.
class, and although he is probably the best welter
on the continent, the welterweight division has
ceased to be seriously considered. Still, hopes are
entertained that the State will soon have a recog-
nised champion in Mervyn Williams, the middle-
weight. At Brisbane on Saturday night the young
man with ihc aristocratic name gave Charlie Ring
a most artistic hiding, and wound up by outing him
in the 19th round. And Ring is no slouch with
the weppings that Nature gave him, as shown by his
Sydney win over the late Frank Griffin. Inci-
dentally, the Saturday-night tariff in Brisbane is
ten-six-four-three-plus-tax, as against twenty-ten-
five-three-plus-tax in Sydney. And the northern
fights are rather more exhilarating as a rule. But
the Sydney ringside “sport” is mostly a mug.
No easy task had Spar go with Fred
Jacks, the English featherweight. Weak in
the betting owing to
his showing against
Bill Grime, Jacks
roused a Melbourne
crowd to enthusiasm
by his artistry and
pluck. He boxed like
a graduate from the
most scientific English
school, and exhibited
all the latest American
improvements in the
way of in-fighting and
a baffling defence.
Spargo had to go for
his life to get the de-
cision, and was well
punched in the process.
The pair will meet
again.
Handsome FRED
JACKS, who put
up a pood 20-round
go against Spargo.
The “fight” between the two Sydney ban-
tams, Gray and Tingle, was a weariness of the flesh.
Wallis, the stout Stadium referee, stood it for 12
rounds, then he threw up his hands in a despairing
attitude, muttered “no contest,” and waddled out of
the ring. Gray got in some good body punches in
the early rounds, but Tingle clinched whenever he
could, and betrayed no liking for his contract. It
was the lads’ fourth meeting, and each may have
learned to cope with the other’s attack, but it was
an appalling exhibition to watch. The fact is that
second-rate bantams are not worth a Saturday-night
date at 21s. Bd., 10s. 10d., ss. sd. and 3s. 3d.
* * * *
“Lond.”: Boxing contests between men
who have lost a limb in the war are the latest idea
of the Disabled Soldiers’ Society in England. Opinions
differ astonishingly about it. Some call it a “dis-
gusting” idea, and suggest that it ought to be
stopped bv the police, the promoters, on the other
hand, consider it a splendid chance to make the
sufferers feel that they are not out of things be-
cause of their loss, and to bring them back into sport
on equal terms, with a contest for the one-armed,
and another for the one-legged—but wearing an
artificial limb. One of the latter has twice walked
the 70-odd miles from London to Brighton lately in
good time, mainly with the idea of showing his sup-
posedly-crippled comrades that they need not be
back-numbers.
* # * *
“Past Grammar”: The English Rugby
world must have got the shock of the season when
Oxford went under to Cambridge. Oxford were
strong in the back division, where Lawton, the
Queenslander, whose success in his new “possie” at
full back was forecasted by a Bulletin writer, is
reported to have played a great game. The Oxford
break-up is said to have been due to the centres
failing to feed the wings, Aitken (M.L.) and Wal-
lace (N.S.W.). That a born centre-three like
Aitken, who represented Maoriland against the
Springboks in this position, should have been taken
out to the wing, makes it look as if the Oxford selec-
tors have had as much to do with the defeat as the
players.
* * * *
Adelaide, where Rugby football is un-
known, could make nothing of the 21-to-8 victory of
Cambridge over Oxford. Among other things the
cable mentioned that Oxford had been favorites.
Hence, no doubt, the Register’s sage announcement
that the Dark Blues were regarded as stone morals,
the books demanding odds of 21 to 8 on.
Two new automobile records went on the
book last week. Boyd Edkins, in a Vauxhall car,
left the dust between Brisbane and Sydney (643
miles) behind in 18 hours 58min., 40min. ahead of
the previous best time. Then Norman Smith, in
an Essex, sped over the Sydney-Melbourne roads
(565 miles) in 15 hours 39min., 68min. faster than
A. V. Turner’s figures, registered a few days before,
and 1J hour faster than the Sydney-Melbourne
express.
HEBREW MELODY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne bookmakers recently held a meeting at
Tattersall’s Club to protest against the proposed re-
enactment of the betting tax.
Dull the broken timbrel rings,
Cracked, alas ! the jew’s-harp strings ;
Groans the psalter from afar,
Softly sighs the sad shofar.
C lerks, in sackcloth, burn their books,
l’ublicans wear gloomy looks.
Long lament the Chosen crowd,
As with voices, harsh and loud,
Prophets fearsome woes foretell
For the tribes of Israel.
Can it be, a tax so vickid,
Sixpence on each betting tickid?
1 s it possible, ye gods!
Further still to shorten odds?
If ve do, von’t punters qvote
Other figures on the Tote?
Is it justith thus to drag
Shekels from the bookicth’ bag?
“No more turkey, no champagne.”
Hear the psalter’s low refrain!
“Hebrews, sell your tiamond rings!”
Wail the smitten jew’s-harp strings.
“You must smoke a cheap cigar.”
Softly sighs the sad shofar.

To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to oveicome sickness of all
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t aliow old
fermenting food to stay in them for days,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamheriain’s Tablets are good for con-
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
s-omach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening qualities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only
“half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of this
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines—
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain’s Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. They
are mild and gentle in their action and
pleasant to take.
Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and misery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.

CONSTIP ATION is caused by errors
in diet, indigestion, or weakness
of the bowels. No matter what is
the cause, there is no preparation equal
to Chamberlain’s Tablets for relieving
Constipation. They gently stimulate
the bowels to natural, regular action.
If you wish to try before you buy, send
your address and twopence for postage to
Chamberlain’s Ltd., 520 Riioy St., Sydney, N.S.W
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and bowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
Half a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve; for children under six, one-third
of a Tablet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering,* restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.

THE INKY WAY.
“Topee”: I don’t know any place where what
Lewis Carroll called “portmanteau” words are more
in use than they are in Sydney. The trammy’s
“Fe-e-ez” for “Fares, please” is a case in point.
Here's another. I tendered the cash the other day
at a cooked-focd shop for two ham-sandwiches and
two of beef. “Two hanch two beench, one two, two
’ai'f!” was the shopman’s brisk intimation to the
cashier.
“Herm”: A bit out of the run of battle litera-
ture is Colonel J. F. C. Fuller’s book, “Tanks in the
Great War.” Therein he gives the genealogy of the
iron chariots, from their first appearance in war-
fare in the year 3500 b.c., when the Chinese are
supposed to have used them, down to the last word
in tank design in 1919. They materialised in
France in September, 1916. Between that time
and the end of the war many faults were eliminated
by a group of inventors in England, but, even so,
the final word in tanks was not very far from the
first, a great tribute to the original designers.
Colonel Fuller describes in detail various forms of
land-ships and iron chariots which appeared in
former wars. It still seems rather uncertain whether
the tanks really justified their usage in modern
warfare.
“Thorold”: “The Deacon’s” plaint (B. 8/11/’22)
recalls an experience when the long-defunct Sydney
Echo shoved me on minor reporting from copy-
running at the age of 14. The objection of some of
the men scribes to a mere kid sharing their box was
voiced to Benjamin Lee, S.M., who made it his
business to complain to Sam Cook that I was
likely to hear things unfit for childish ears. Cook
thereupon sat down hard on my journalistic aspira-
tions. A week or two later I was working on a
little Balmain weekly and listening to all the police-
court dirt available—right under Benjamin Lee’s
nose whenever he took his turn at this court. Not
only that, but the little Echo’s stern parent, the
S. M. Hera no, bought the more horrible bits of
police news from me in the capacity of its local
correspondent.
“El Verdugo”: If there are any newspaper men
out of work after next March it will be their own
fault, and not that of the proprietors, who are
showing a zealous desire to add to the flow of
ink. The Melbourne Sun is due about April, and
round about that month some £60,000 worth of
good seed sown by the Victorian farmers’ organisa-
tions will come up as a daily plant in the old Herald
building. Joynton Smith really does mean to start
his long-promised Sydney daily—the middle of next
year is now indicated as the psychological moment
when the Herald, Telegraph and Daily Mail will
get the shock of their lives. Add to that the require-
ments of the Davidson venture in Adelaide, and of
the Perth Daily News, which has changed hands to
a local syndicate (allegedly for £75,000), and the
demand for staffs promises to be a pretty strong one.
“L.E.”: The price paid for local serials never
seems to rise. By most Australian papers £25 is
still regarded as a fair figure for a com-
plete novel —which pans out at about 10s. a
thousand words. Some newspapers never go above
£l5. I have heard a tenner has sometimes been
added to these sums for the author’s name,
when that author was not anxious for the honor of
appearing in the great journal. An average price in
England for an average serial, in no way better than
t u e local £l5 article, is at least £l5O, and London
Daily Telegraph once paid Albert Dorrington, before
his name was of any special value, £3OO for a
thriller. Sydney Evening News recently paid full
space rates for an Australian novel, but, so far as
is known, it was the first daily in the country that
ever did such a thing. Art in Australia (which is
not a millionaire firm by any means) pays remark-
able prices—and gets some remarkable poetry and
prose in consequence. For the serial which concludes
in the coming (December) issue of the Home the
Art in Australia people paid full space rates un-
asked, and as a matter of course. And the S. M.
Herald, which is a millionaire concern, prints syndi-
cated mush which with a little bargaining can be
bought as low as 75,000 words for a fiver!
“J.H.” (London) : To an oversea journalist there
are few things more fascinating in Fleet-street than
the fierce competition for an exclusive “story.” Of
the dailies the Chronicle invariably bags most of
the scoops, with the Express (probably the best sub-
edited daily in the world), running it a close
second. The Northcliffe journals are enterprising, but
apt to embellish an authentic story with a moss of
inaccurate top-hamper. In the evening press the
Standard is an easy first. It is accurate, brilliantly
edited, and well served by its band of special contri-
butors. No other evening newspaper runs to weekly
articles by a quartette of the calibre of Dean Inge,
Maurice Hewlett, E. B. Osborn and Horace Annesley
Vaehell, to say nothing of T. W. 11. Crosland and
Edith Shackleton. E. A. Parry (a County Court
Judge with a rare literary turn and a brilliant grip
of the legal and sociological problems of the day) is
another frequent contributor. The paper is York-
shire-owned, Sir Edward Hulton, a big racing man,
being chief proprietor. But his staff is Scotch, from
D. T. Phillips, the editor, down to the boy who takes
the copy to the subs. The editorial staff boasts but
one outlander. He used to practise at the N.S.W.
Bar.
The London Times (31/8/’22) gave a column and
three-quarters on Volume I Series IV of the His-
torical Records of Australia, edited by Dr. Frederick
Watson. This volume contains the legal papers relat-
ing to the development of a constitution. Some ex-
tracts :
“The great advantage which overseas history, the
history or histories of the young nations, possesses,
as against the histories of older peoples and civilisa-
tions, is that there is, or ought to be, no doubt what-
ever as to the beginnings. Especially is this so in
the case of so young a nation as Australia. All
praise is due to the self-governing Dominions for
sparing no trouble or expense to procure and make
available every kind of document which has any
direct bearing on their history. It means pride in
their nationhood—amply justified—and an actual con-
tribution to that nationhood by enabling the full
story of the nation to be truly told from beginning
to end. All students, and, indeed, all citizens, of
the British Empire are under an obligation to
Dominion, State and Provincial Governments on the
one hand, and on the other, not only to the very
competent men who actually collect and edit the
documents, but also to the overseas historians who
have already made such excellent use of them.”
“This book, with its lucid introduction and notes,
should be of exceptional value and interest to all
who are studying the constitutional side of the British
Empire.”
Most of the local dailies —the ones which now,
humorously enough, term themselves “Nationalist” —
put this work in their “Publications Received” sec-
tion.
“P.”: The new Mayor of Bath (England) is Aider-
man Cedric Chivers, who already had a world-wide
reputation as one of the most famous of past, present
or future bookbinders. Some of the stuff turned
out from Milsom-street is of the most magnificent
character, and, of course, the best always goes to
America, where the Chivers connection is enormous.
The alderman is also a leader of the Liberal party
in the West of England, and once undertook a jour-
ney from Chicago—it was at the time of the 1919
election —to vote. He arrived at the polling-booth
five minutes before it closed, travelling from Liver-
pool by special trains for the purpose.
Rafael Sabatini, whose “Captain Blood” is one
of the good things of the publishing season, is an
Italian bv birth, but naturalised as an Englishman.
He was educated in Germany and Switzerland, and
during the war acquired fame in the War Office
Intelligence Department, which contained a good
few literary men. Unlike some of them, Rafael has
not gone to the files for his plots, though there
were enough of them there. Originally, Sabatini
was a publisher, and wrote in his spare time. To-
day he writes and leaves the publishing to other
hands.


MAIZE.
Here are some facts regarding experiments in the fertilisa-
tion of MAIZE in New South Wales, proving beyond question
the immense value of Sulphate of Ammonia as applied to this
class of crop:—
“At MOUNT GEORGE, while the maize
crop was considerably damaged by magpies,
a mixture of 1 401 b. Superphosphate and 701 b.
SULPHATE OF AMMONIA per acre
yielded 75.7 bushels. The next best trial was
1401 b. Superphosphate alone yielding 60.22
bushels. The ‘No Manure’ plot gave a
return of 50 bushels.’’
(“N.S.W. Agricultural Gazette,” 1/1 1/’21.)
“At TUMUT PLAINS, 1401 b. Superphos-
phate and 701 b. SULPHATE OF
AMMONIA per acre returned 1 03.52 bushels.
Second place in these trials was secured by
equal proportions of superphosphate and
bone-dust applied at rate of per acre,
yielding 99.50 bushels. ‘No Manure’ plot
gave 86.48 bushels.’’
(“N.S.W. Agricultural Gazette,” 1/1 /’22.)
“At TILBA TILBA experiments in maize
grown for green fodder revealed that the
mixture containing a high percentage of
SULPHATE OF AMMONIA gave the high-
est yield of 34 tons to the acre, being 7 tons
more than the next best.”

“The Maid of the Mountains” has
changed its personnel somewhat since Mel-
bourne last saw it at the Royal. Frank
Freeman, whose Baldasarre breathed the
Christian spirit of a Y.M.C.A. hut, has been
followed by Anew McMaster, who is a
bandit of the h.e. school. However, there
are few flashes of real force in McMaster’s
melodramatic turbulence, and his heart-
swollen utterances are not likely to damage
recollections of the previous pretty fellow.
Reginald Purdell, the new Tonio, isn’t
remarkable as a humorist. In his like-
ness to Dan Booker and other jesters
of the type he almost amounts to a
memoir of English low comedy in the
last few years. Still, he is cheer.ul enough,
and may keep his origin reasonably subdued
by refraining from allusions to kippers and
other standard Cockney jokes. Angela, the
daughter of General Arthur Stigant, has
become the property of Nellie Payne, who
cheeks the robber magnate very effectively
in his cave and is a more appealing picture
of Dago flapperhood than her predecessor,
Violet Yorke. Nellie, however, seems a little
hapless as an outraged angel suffering the
first pangs of Baldasarre’s deception in the
second act. Mione Stewart repeats her
young widow to the satisfaction of every-
body, but Gladys Moncrieff wasn’t up
to concert pitch on Saturday night. Her
soprano appeared a bit tired, but her bobbed-
haired Teresa, with the Carmen-like postur-
ings, was as handsome as before. Stigant, as
General Malona, continues to go* on the gag
and jolly the luscious maidens who have
been crowded into his palace for his enter-
tainment. Leslie Holland remains the in-
edible and incredible Crumpet, to the satis-
faction of all parties concerned, and Robert
Chisholm is on the salary-list as Beppo,
warbling blithely of the seven rages of Love.

The Hugh Ward-Fuller combination is
delivering its first blow at the J.CAV. monop-
oly with “The O’Brien Girl” at Melbourne
Princess’s on Boxing Night. In vain have
press-agents in the service of the enemy
attacked the show as an attempt to raise the
sectarian issue. A remodelled and redecorated
theatre is in course of preparation, and the
new amalgam is squandering bags of cash
on extra shifts to have its ambitions fully
realised on the opening date. At time of writ-
ing painters, plumbers, electricians, masons,
carpenters and other toilers are working
right round the clock, and the unwonted
sight of a small army of men emerging for
meals on the Sabbath has kept the sleepy

The Christmas treat at Melbourne Palace

this time, but the Sydney nobleman whom
East Sydney has just biffed so hard candidly
admits that they are all high-class, and have
been brought from Newtown, and other world-
centres, at overpowering expense.

Fifteen members of the Pen and Palette
Club are exhibiting 140 pictures at Mel-
bourne Athenseum. The most interesting
of the artists is W. S. Percy, the comedian,
who handles water-color very uleasantly in
a study of a shambling old Weyinouth-street,
and scores further with another subject,
“Old Cottages, York.” On the other hand
his etchings are robbed of daintiness
by a hard and forbidding line. F. Gladstone
Longstaff sends a couple of horses’ heads,
and diarises summer days in the Dandenong
Hills. His best thing is father reminiscent
of the work of Harold Herbert, who has
another unacknowledged artistic offspring in
Ralph W. Warner. Ralph’s “Warm After-
noon, Hobart,” is the gospel according to
Herbert uttered in stentorian tones. Henry
W. Wicks’s pleasant but undistinguished
art turns the poetry of bush scenes into
pretty album verse. W. Coleman, jun., pic-
tures some unobtrusive war scenes, and Cyril
Dillon etches some aspects of the Melbourne
Grammar School. R. S. Wenban deserves a
mention for his “Weymouth Bridge,” and
for the striking simplicity and truth of “A
Sheltered Retreat.” F. Degenhardt is no-
where very arresting, except in “The Pass-
ing of the Storm,” which is at least original
in the treatment of the clouds. David Walker
records the small points of Tasmanian moun-
tain scenery with conspicuous zest in “The
Settlers, Iluonville,” but his palette swag-
gers less in “Near Mt. Wellington.”
From an Adelaide critic:—
The Arts and Crafts Club has a nice little show
at the Society of Arts Gallery. The paintings are
unambitious, but strike a new note in one or two
cases. A. A. Paul, for example, has some imagina-
tive figure studies; and Paula Brain, having already
grace, needs only to acquire strength as well. Dalton
Hall is unusual and attractive in his pictures of ships,
with heavy blue coloring and misty, undefined
outlines. Giles, on the other hand, shows ships and
wharves with plain realism. Maude Priest has a
few paintings held over from her recent one-woman
show, Goodchild’s etchings have already found
National Gallery acceptance, and Mary Harris revives
an old art with wood-blocks.

Adelaide Royal, King’s and P. of Wales
are all closed, though the first-named opened
for one night to let the ’Varsity students
give a merry mixed show, and for another
to house Huxham’s Serenaders, driven in-
doors by the first rain Adelaide has seen
for six weeks. The Majestic carries on
cheerfully, twice a day, with a variety show,
specially strong just now on the musical
side. Mark Twain’s “Court of King Arthur”
is at the York; and Wallace Reid is at
Wondergraph with his “Across the Conti-
nent” motor-race. West’s stars House
Peters, Owen Moore is at the Grand, and
in “The Storm,” now being encored at the
Pav., the male element has two to one the
best of it.

“The Arcadians,” the last word in tuneful
merriment, transferred themselves from Syd-
ney Theatre Royal to Her Majesty’s last
night, all traces of the homicide of J. Caesar,
the felo de se of M. Brutus and C. Cassius,
and the high-explosive oratory of M. Antony
having been erased. Oscar Asche’s Shaks-
pearean season at Sydney was as brief as it
wag arresting.

proved rich in glittering scenes, radiant cos-

juvenile fascinations and all- the other essen-

met gory ends at the hands of Trotsky’s dis-
ciplinarians ; on the other hand, worse ones
evaded their national critics, and won to
safety in lands where wage-plugs make mil-
lionaires of theatrical entrepreneurs. Will

making market at about par, and Napier

the admiration of. local Nationalist poli-
ticians: they are champion cont rtionists.

“Sunshine Sally,” the Australian filrn at
the Haymarket, is the usual riot of larrikins,
hawkers and factory flappers. This insist-
ence on the fiction that the bottle-o’ and
his lass are our most truly representative
citizens grows tedious, and yet that the local
film is making strides is evinced by the
photographic results and the production
standards, both of which are ever on the up-
grade. Yvonne Pavis scores heavily as
“Sunshine Sally.” The Lyceum has a brace
of red-blooded films in “Steelheart” and
“The Man Unconquerable.” The Lyric
takes for its text, “Don’t Neglect Your
Wives.” Doug Fairbanks is at the Rialto
in “When the Clouds Roll By.” The Strand
has an exquisitely-produced film-panto,
“Babes in the Wood.” and Charlie Chaplin
in “The Idle Class.” the Globe sermonises
on “The Blindness of Divorce,” and the Cry-
stal Palace is anxious to find out “What’s
Wrong with the Women.”
“Oxide”: Australia will have to make
films a lot better than “A Daughter of Aus-
tralia” if they are to have any popularity at
all. This last infliction is the poorest home-
made picture I have seen. One could forgive
“JULIUS CAESAR,” AT HER
MAJESTY’S, SYDNEY.

the absurdly inadequate and involved “plot”
if the film had a real Australian atmosphere,
or if its people and scenes were at all charac-
teristic of the country. About the only time
one feels at home is when the swagman, the
hero’s “pal,” dries his tears and permits him-
self to be swaggish. If Australian producers
are going to create a market for their pic-
tures, they will have to get some decent
yarns to build on, or adopt the Yankee idea
of featuring a popular mummer. It is too
much, I suppose, to expect both.
“Wilfrido”: Barrie deserves the fortune
he has made out of his plays, but he owes a
lot to the beauty and talent of his mummers.
Doubtless his habit of strict personal super-
vision and direction has contributed largely
to his success, yet it took a good deal of
picking to get this lot: Irene Vanbrugh,
Winifred Emery, Ellaline Terriss, Marion
Terry, Pauline Chase, Fay Compton, Kath-
leen Nesbitt, Mary Jerrold, Nina Boucicault,
Hilda Trevelyan, Ellen Terry, Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, Gaby Deslys, Forbes Robertson,
Edmund Gwenn, Norman McKinnel. Arthur
Whitby, Norman Forbes, Eric Lewis, Leon

What modern dramatic author has had a
brainier or more personable collection?
From a land where the movies are a
power:—
Moving-pic tore presentation on Broadway is some-
thing more elaborate than throwing the film on the
screen and sawing out appropriate music, as in Paris
and London, and in Australia. The managers of the
Old World haven’t the first idea of putting a pitcher
show over, even in leading houses like the Opera
House, London, and the King Edward, in Paris. In
the projection of the picture the Yank beats them
out of sight. But pitehers-cxm-vaudeville are
all the go in New York. The Capitol, which has
a seating capacity of 5400, and standing room, which
is allowed, for hundreds more, goes further. It runs
a permanent chorus, ballet, solo dancers, singers,
and a symphony orchestra of 172 instrumentalists —-
I counted ’em, so I know —besides a beautiful organ.
S. L. Rothafel, who directs this show, is a man of
fine taste, and is forever working on new ideas to
keep pace with the changing films. A programme
at the Capitol comprises ,a classical number by the
orchestra, a prologue of song and ballet, the feature
picture, and perhaps a topical gazette specially
arranged for the theatre from fragments of all the
news reels produced in New York. For two shows
during the day the organist relieves the band. Rotha-
fel’s lighting plant is a marvel, and his picture,
thrown from a box 197 feet away, is clear as crystal
and as steady as an oil painting. In this vast house
singers from the Metropolitan Opera often pipe their
best, and David Bispham sang there just before his
death. And Rappo’s orchestra is equal to the best
London organisation, that of Henry Wood. Then
there are the Rivoli, the Rialto and the Strand, all
with large orchestras numbering up to 100 players.
These houses introduce singers and ballets. In most
of the bands Germans predominate, though one finds
numbers of Italians, a few Frenchmen, and a smatter-
ing of English and Irish names. One may see the
full show at the Capitol during the afternoon for
30 cents. At night the lowest-priced seat is half a
dollar.

“Nella”: “Stargazer’s” yarn of how Harry
Rickards kept a specially execrable turn as
the last item on the programme, in order
to empty the theatre promptly (B.
14/12/’22), reminds me that on one vaude-
ville circuit in the U.S.A. the same dodge
was tried. A couple of sisters were billed
as “The Worst Singers in the World,” and
appeared with a wire-netting screen in front
of them for protection. But that item be-
came the star turn of the show. The wire-
netting hint did it, and the delighted and
chivalrous patrons came nightly armed with
the contents of their garbage-bins, and
hurled noisome offerings at the ladies. They
have a subtle sense of humor, the Yanks.
“G.”: Louis Parker, who is writing a
romantic play for production in London next
season, once acted as secretary to Wilson
Barrett. Parker was a bit of a Baconian,
while Barrett was orthodox. Once when
travelling together Parker expounded his
Baconian theories so exhaustively that at
last the author of “The Sign of the Cross”
tried to finish the argument once and for
all. “You must admit,” said the great man,
“that the plays could only have been written
by one who was himself author, actor and
manager.” Parker started back. “Great
Heavens, Barrett!” he exclaimed, “surely
they’re not as bad as all that!”
“J.H.”: The years-old litigation between
Ada Reeve and her husband, A. W. Cotton
—as far back as 1918 there was a N.S.W.
Full Court judgment in favor of the lady—
has resulted in Cotton ambling into the Isle
of Wight Bankruptcy Court. Among oilier
things, he told the presiding bigwig that

last war year yielded a profit of £7OO a week.
And she can’t be doing any worse with
“Spangles.”
“N.Y.”: A unique distinction has fallen
to “Storky” Adams, the Australian athlete
and showman. Recently he delivered a
lecture on Nor-’West Australia, with film
illustrations, to the National Geographic
Society of U.S.A., at Washington. These
National Geographic shows are given during
the winter months at the New Masonic
Auditonum, which has a seating capacity of
1100, and in order that 2000 members of the
society might see “Australia’s Wild Nor’-
West” afternoon and evening sessions were
arranged. The secretary advised Adams
that he had been given the place of honor on
the lecture list —the opening lecture of the
season.
“Norbell”: How these young Australian
mummers come on ! I heard Hartley Court
warbling ballads at a vaudeville show the
other night—he is “retained” by a music-
publishing firm for the purpose. A few
years back he was a beginner in the chorus
of the Tivoli Follies. Then he stepped into
the comedian’s socks and played leads. Next
he had a go at musical comedy with Wil-
loughby, and tried drama with both Muriel
Starr and Emelie F'olini. He is now panto-
mime s.-m., a job that calls for the tact of
a Governor-General’s private secretary and
the comprehensive proficiency of a company-
sergeant-major. Court is a Sydney lad, and
doesn’t look his 26 years.
“Nimshi”: I wonder how many P. Point-
ers can recollect George Thorne. It was my
good fortune to see him in four operas, but
his performance as
Ko lvo in “The
.Mikado” made such
an impression upon
me as to blur the
memory of his
other parts. Per-
haps it was be-
cause, as Ko Ko,
he laughed oftener.
Those who remem-
ber the Thorne
laugh will under-
stand. No weirder
cackle ever ema-
il at e d from a

couldn’t sing for
nuts, but he spoke
his lines inimit-
ably, and all his
movements were in-
describably quaint.
When Thorne died
it was freely pre-
dicted that the
H’Oyly Carte tour-
ing co. would come
a “mucker,” so in-
dispensable did he
seem. I believe it
did suspend opera-
tions for a season.

judice he had to contend with he will never
forget.
“T.W.”: There are several instances of
buskers rising to eminence in the English
tljeatres and giving practically the same
show on the boards that they purveyed in
the open air (B. 7/12/’22). Stanley Kirkby
and Harry Hudson, who are now stars at
places Lke London’s Coliseum, put in many
seasons together in an open-air pierrot stunt
at Margate. The nigger-on-the-sands, who
was almost the sole entertainment when
Chirgwin began, still has his place, but his
ambition, if it doesn’t halt at the nearest
pub, sometimes leads him to the enclosed
Pierrot show, and the man with the real stuff
in him can climb from there to the vaude-
ville circuits. Carrie Tubb, now, with one
exception, the leading concert and oratorio
soprano in Britain, made her start with
Kirkby’s pierrots at Margate, and stuck to
that job for several years before she dis-
covered thqt she could do nobler deeds.
“8.C.”: The Firm pays a popular small-
part lady of my acquaintance 15 notes a
week. By contrast, Mrs. Patrick Campbell
received 12 a week to undertake Rachel
Denison in “Tares,” under the management
of Mrs. Bqndmann-Palmer in 1889. For
that massive sum she had to give two weeks’
rehearsal free, provide her own wardrobe,
and pay her own fare from London to the
starting town of the tour, the manageress
only promising to provide a third-class ticket
between various stopping-places. What
the rest of the crowd got is not known.
One of them was Caleb Porter, who first
played here as Nero in “The Sign of the
Cross.” and was subsequently in “Kismet”
and other shows with Oscar Asche. Among
Mrs. Campbell’s treasures is a letter of
sympathy and respect, signed by Porter and
the rest of her colleagues, when she had to
leave “Tares,” because her boss declared she
belonged to the “squirming school of acting.”
“Park Royal”: Melbourne’s Mermaid
Play Society has done so well this year, re-
latively speaking, that it hasn’t had to worry
its guarantors. This result has been brought
about by the substitution of “commercial”
plays for those of the highbrow type, but
the money-spinners have, for the most part,
been bright and cleverly constructed, so the
feelings of superiah people haven’t been har-
rowed overmuch. Still, now that fair audi-
ences can be depended on, the Mermaids
should try them, now and again, with really
high-class dramatic fare. It would be a
daring experiment, particularly in Mel-
bourne, but a society with guarantors will-
ing to lend their ears in the sacred cause
ought to be willing to take the risk.
“L.E.”: Oscar Asche expected to be
slashed by the critics for his production of
“Julius Caesar,” because he doesn't produce
Shakspeare in what he calls the “high-
brow way”—that is, on bare boards and
with no seenery. “If Shakspeare had lived
to-day,” Oscar announced modestly, “he would
produce ‘Julius Caesar’ as I do.” The stout
mime is, of course, wrong. The highbrow
way, as the productions of the Phoenix
Society proved to everybody except a few
old-fashioped impresarios, happens to be cor-
rect ; that is all. The explanation is simple.
Shakspeare wrote for a special theatre,
which was quite unlike a modern theatre,
and arranged his material in a great number
of short scenes. The action should be rapid
and continuous, not held up by the scene-
shifting or the fall of a curtain that cuts
it in pieces like a guillotine. To play
Shakspeare in the Asche method the text
has to be sub-edited with drastic cuts. Few
people have ever seen a Shakspeare play
produced as Shaksoeare wrote it. Those who
have realise how perfectly Shakspeare knew
his job.
“Cfesar’s Ghost”: A Sydney actress, who
had angered her family by going on the
stage, returned to the suburb of her birth
to play Lady Isabel in “East Lynne.” To
mark their disapproval of her disreputable
occupation the family attended in force. All
went well until Lady Isabel, turning on
Sir Francis Levison, declaimed: “If yew
have put me beyond the pa-pale of society,
I am still the daughter of Lahrd Mount
Severn !” At this an infuriated matron rose
from her seat. “Don’t you believe her,
people!” she cried to the house. “She’s a
lying hussie. Her father is only a tuck-
pointer, but he’s too good for the likes
of ’er.”
“Blackfriars”: Although Britain and
Amurrica are both opening their arms to the
German musical tribe in the mass, there are
exceptions. Frau Gadski, a Wagnerian
prima donna, who used to have Noo Yoick’s
smart set by its wool until she lost her grip
by irrepressible pro-IJunnism, still finds it
impossible to emerge from a well-deserved
retirement. She is calling off projected
concerts at the request of public authorities.
One or two recent Australian newspaper allu-
sions to Scharf, the exotic pianist who went
madly Hun in Melbourne and had to be
roped in and eventually exported to the place
he claimed to love, make me suspicious that
he is cherishing hopes of a fresh descent on
the Commonwealth. If he has any sense he
will remain out of it, for his musical com-
patriots who had the decency to keep their
mouths tight are not getting mtfch of a spin
here these times.
Recollections of Bumpstarter—
Bumpstarter was a promising young actor when
he joined the Wilson Forbes Dramatic Co., to play
small parts. We were harrowing the western dis-
trict of Victoria at the time. Bumpstarter was
over-punctilious in his art. When, as the butler, he
was instructed to take a letter to some character
“off,” he searched the building till he found him
and shoved the missive into his hand. “Go to the
armory, and tell Sir Jasper I defy him, the
coward!” declaimed the hero. Bumpstarter promptly
burst into the men’s dressing-room, and, facing the
late Gus Glover, announced woodenly: “The boss
says you’re a cow, and he defies yer.” We played
in the Mechanics’ Institute at Penshurst, and, dur-
ing the action of the play, Bumpstarter was ordered
to “take this bag of gold into the library and lock
it in the safe.” He took the proffered bag and key,
and pestered all the subscribers in the reading-room
next door, demanding to know where the safe was.
The next night, at Hamilton, I had done my bit
and was standing in the wings waiting for my wife.
Bumpstarter was a minor murderer, this time, and
the villain, Glover, handed him a formidable
butcher’s knife, saying: “Take this dagger and
plunge it into Antonio’s heart. You will find him
yonder,” and he pointed in my direction. Bump-
starter grabbed the snickersnee, but I didn’t wait
for further developments. I jettisoned my intention
of waiting for the missus. Inside two ticks, or less,
I was streaking up Grey-street to the pub, for, on
that occasion, I was Antonio.
“J.H.” (London) : John Drinkwater,
whose “Abraham Lincoln” had such a great
run three years ago (Australia, of course,
hasn’t seen it yet), has struck another win-
ner. His “Mary Stuart,” produced at the
Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, is packing
the house eight times a week. And it’s high-
brow stuff, too —every line of it.
“E.T.”: Tom Walls, the first Peter Doody
that Australia saw, should be very “merry
and bright” these days. He is a full-blown
London manager, and, with his partner, Leslie
Henson, holds the rights of “Tons of Money,”
the big farcical hit at the Shaftesbury. Walls
has frequently donned the colors as an ama-
teur race-rider, and did a b't in that line in
Victoria. Latterly, with “Tons of Money”
to fall back on, he has become an owner.
“Second Murderer”: “ J.0.M.” says I’m
wrong in claiming that W. E. Sheridan last
played “King Lear” in Sydney at the Queen’s.
But I never made that claim. I don’t even
know where the Queen’s stood. I saw Sheri-
dan play Lear at the T.R., Melbourne, and
although I was only a kid then, his per-
formance left a lasting impression. If Allan
Wilkie, that indefatigable Shakspearean pro-
ducer, does it half as well as the American
tragedian. I’ll be satisfied. Sheridan’s
brother, Robert, was mumming in Denver,

U.S.A., some years ago, but I fancy he never
had such a magnificent tragic stop as his
brother William.
“The Prompter’s Understudy” : Let 'tae tell
“Dido” (B. 14/12/’22) that the vaudeville
sketch requires more “stage acumen” in its
construction than does a five-act melodrama,
or a IG-act revue. The greatest difficulty is
in the creation of the right atmosphere. It
may be that the Limejuice Sisters have just
finished, in a front scene, their songandance
concerning Gerty being flirty; or perhaps
Adenoids the Inimitable, direct from Lon-
don, New York and Nova Zembla, has just
ceased singing of his mother-in-law, the
lodger, sausages and beer; and then the pro-
gramme announces “Slick and Slack —Sketch
Team—‘Only a Sardine.’ ” The audience
don’t know __ whether it’s funny or serious
or both. Up goes the rag, and inside 60
seconds—the whole, act only takes 12 minutes
—Mr. Jones and his -wife, who are Slick and
Slack in public, have to give what Kipling
calls the “essential guts” of the thing, and
get the audience interested. It’s a dashed
difficult job. I’ve tried it and know. But
Musgrove, of the Tivoli, does encourage Aus-
tralian sketch-writing. An imported sketch
couple failed in their opening effort at the
Tivoli recently, and Musgrove stood them
down till a local writer —Norman Campbell
—had written two new sketches for them,
and with these the team was successful.
Also, Musgrove staged Campbell’s dramatic
sketch, “Out of the Purple East,” a couple
of months ago, and he purposes producing
other playlets by the same writer.
“Whitebait”: O. Henry’s yarn, “A Re-
trieved Reformation,” which provided the
plot for “ALas Jimmy Valentine,” staged in
Australia a few years ago, is founded on the
strange, case of one Dick Price, who was in
the Ohio State Penitentiary with the author.
Price was an “indeterminate-sentence” man,
whose ability to open combination locks was
one of the mysteries of American police
circles. During his term of imprisonment
the. Press-Post Publishing Co., of Columbus,
Ohio, had trouble with its shareholders, and
the upshot was that the treasurer fled, leav-
ing valuable papers locked up in the com-
pany’s combination safe. Everybody feared
to break the lock by nitro-glycerine, and
then someone thought of Price, and asked
him if lie would do the job. He said he
would if he received a free pardon, and this
was promised him by the State Governor.
Price thereupon filed his nails down to the
quick, alleging that his fingers were made
super-sensitive by this means, and 15 seconds
after he had put liis hand on the lock he
had opened the door. The achievement
caused a sensation in America, and Price
won a weird notoriety, but he never got
loose. The Ohio Governor, after considera-
tion, refused to honor his bond, and Price,
already weakened by long Spells of solitary
confinement, died soon after “of a broken
heart.”. He was only 20, and, according to
the enlightened law of Ohio, he practically
became a lifer after being committed for his
third offence.
“Randolph Rentless” : Not much has been
heard of Jimmy Ryan (“Narranghi Boori”)
since he left for America 10 years ago, and
the little that has filtered through has been
mostly apocryphal. At latest Jimmy was
touring with a “Silver King” co- There was
a yarn that he had married a millionairess.
Jimmy only wishes he had.
THE DANCER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The dancers flock like homing doves,
They wheel and part and mass,
Small Cupids winged and little Loves,
They settle on the grass.
Then burst to movement like a song,
And sweep the glowing stage along.
Now comes one like a pigeon fair
That sways and takes the wind,
Her sw'eet, small body blown in air
Above her lovely kind,
Aspiring in the yellow sheejn,
Like smoke arising faint and clean,
A poem is the grace of her,
A poem of the snow,
And airs that lift the petals where
The warm, white roses blow.
While music rises sweet and thin.
The wind has tossed a flower in.

Have you ever thought
what life would be
without Music ?
In the days of the early Egyptians music formed part of
their ceremonies, and even savage and uncivilised people had
some primitive musical instruments to accompany their rites.
We, in our enlightened time of scientific mechanics, have our Player Pianos to
fall back on —instruments that will interpret the works of celebrated composers with
a fidelity that is little short of marvellous.
For the entertainment of your family and friends this Christmas, have you given a
thought to music? We have a fine selection of Pianos and Player Pianos for you to
select from, and they can be bought on easy terms if you wish.

"Comet” will do the same for. you. The cost averages about one-fifth of a penny per
sheep—AND NO CRUTCHING IS NEEDED.
The secret of this “Comet” success is scientific design after long and deep
study of every needed feature. The patent “Comet” agitator keeps the mixture
always evenly mixed. The patented handpiece enables easy and instant control
of the jet. The high pressure is regular and quickly adjustable. All parts that
are in contact with the mixture are made of alloys that cannot corrode. The
“Comet” is a genuine Jetting Machine, not any old engine hitched to any old pump.
Don’t face this season without Jetting. Let the “Comet” save your flocks and
pay for itself. Write for special folder and all particulars. We particularly
welcome any correspondence on the blowfly question. Write us. Maybe we can
help you from our records.

Read this extract from “Sydney Morning
Herald,” 12/6/’22: —
“It has been found at Dalmally that a mob
of sheep jetted with arsenic will kill more flies
than all the traps and poison-bags set about
the yards. After jetting flies are always to be
seen dead in great numbers about the yards
and shed.”

look at these manicure sets
Each in a beautiful silver
and blue wrapper
WHEN you see the Cutex manicure sets in their new wrapper
this year, you will instantly welcome them as the perfect
gift for any of your friends.
Everything in them has been arranged to make the care of
the nails a pleasure instead of an irksome duty.
The file, the orange stick, the emery board, in separate com-
partments, the Cuticle Remover, used also as a nail bleach, the
polishes, the Nail White, all in smart containers.
Whether you want a simple remembrance or a beautiful and
distinctive gift that will remain a permanent possession—you
have just the right set at exactly the price that your pocket-book
can conveniently meet.
lii their black and rose boxes these sets add a touch of smart-
ness and distinction to any dressing table.
And the new Christmas Wrapper is like a beautif-ul miniature
painting done in the time of Louis Quatorze. The main colors are
siner and blue with a dash of daring red and exquisite cream. It
is dainty, yet striking and distinctive. It will stand out as unique
among a whole collection of other presents.
You can obtain any of these sets at the leading chemists
and stores throughout Australia.

“The feel of Quality”
That indefinable feeling which is particularly
noticeable in the latest six-cylinder Sunbeam
Models, as evidenced by the following opinion?
of “Men who know”:—
The Autocar : — “There is no doubt that the six
cylinder SUNBEAM car is a distinct advance on ths
previous model, good as that was. The flexibility of tin
engine is as remarkable as its silence of running, and
although the car is decidedly fast, it behaves with th'
Utmost docility.”
The Motor :—“The side valve -six-cylinder SUNBEAM
of which we gave our impressions about 12 months ago.
was undoubtedly a good car, but the present overhead
valve model is far and away superior to it. Than thi'
there could, perhaps, be very little higher> praise. ”

Faceplate: Jimjain lilt hasn’t a teaspoonful of
kick in it....1i0n Wills: Try a more direct, less

and diffuse. .. .F.H.8.: No use whatever F.F.H.:
Couldn’t be much worse.... Wadeli: Too long for
its interest.... One Wanderer Returned: The brag
in very bad verse does not show promise. ... W.E.
(Concord): Not enough there.... Eunice T.: Misses.
.... B.O.: “Holiday Romance” is barely up to Sunday-
school level lulie: Shocking. .. .Jimniy TroUsefs:
Doesn’t make a yarn. . . .Tom H.: Terrible verse. .. .
. ...M.D.: The little ship moves tfi a sort of zig-
zag ecstasy:—-
0, little ship across the sea, how sweet and calm
you look!
You never sigh, you never weep, for the sun
smiles on you from above.
Whenever I see you gliding along, you remind me
of my brook,
The songs it sings as it flows along are the strains
1 shall always love.
Oh, how we would like to be like you,
Having no troubles or worries to bear!
I But, then. I suppose we would be discontent
Without something to make us despair.
....Lizzie L.: He went away saying he’d shoot his
girl if she wasn’t faithful; and after he died a
general curse operated freely for some months.
An abominable person.... Digamipa: Well enough
told, but the yarn isn’t worth while... .A.W.D.:
Cat verse hardly well enough done. .. . J.J.M.: Goes
heavily... .N.H.S.: Too forced and crude.... Pearl
J.: Not up.... Tardy M.: Violent effort after mirth
fails. .. .II.C. (Emu Plains): Judging- by your
letter, the stories could be no good. .. . W.H.P.:
What astonishes us is your ability to get that sense
of evei-ything-in-general and mystic sorrow so de-
lightfully salt: —
On the broad strand ’midst fashion and tO^ (
Happy days and nights ’tis a dream ;
Lacking the dove-like tiny gr@ett frog,
There’s grey nurse and sweet silver bream;
And Well be.-seen bloom, well nigh its prime,
Naked lady and rosemary;
Likewise native rose with young wild thyme,
There, gather’d together by the sea—
Where, day by day the watcher aloft,
Keeps close eye as he scans the bay—
The soaring gulls pois’d keen and alert,
Fiercely dig like penguins for prey—
Sport shoots the breaker curling with foam,
in natur’l tights as chaste as snow—
On the warm beach twin turtle-doves roam,
Bask, and hide from parent and tow.
Seven’s the glee of the dark blue sea,
Thrown high, and cast low on the swell;
Bumping old Neptune’s frank liberty,
His red wine, and his bowl mix’d full—-
Some swim to save—some live to lose life j
The life-saver still heeds the cry;
His life, for life, at the waters of strife,
Saith: “Be not afraid, it is I.”
Turn’d o’er the offing, o’erturned we’d fain,
Walk upright midst the wide sea-tide ;
Bowling on to the great ocean main.
Some swim and go out with the tide!
In sound o’ the surf, ye Fates ne’er sear,
One green leaf for the nude figure;
Apart from those sands, full many a tear,
May drip from Eve’s eyelids and lyre!
... . P.8.P.: Points in the article on Keats and Shel-
ley make it impossible. Why not re-write?. .. .A.G.J.:
Both miss. . . .1.M.: “Disillusionment” is rather
lumpy verse and doesn’t contrive to make its mean-
ing clear... .W.E.L.: You say, “His characters re-
semble nothing so much as a small boy preparing to
ask a favor of his parents.” What, all of them ?
And he has been writing since 1891.... Mary M. : A
mass of words, but no yarn.... A.L.D.: Your humor
made us long for blood and bones. .. .F.F.D.:
Doesn’t strike up. . . .S.A.V.: Impossible to remember
one among thousands all these months. .. .J.N.
(Geelong) : The verse is very rugged, and the theme
has been W'orked to death... .Isabel J.: Mere com-
monplace. .. .D.F.R.: There’s a hint of something in
it, but it’s a long way off. .. .The Tramp: It’s chief
faults are lack of meaning, bad rhymes, horrible
metre and grammar, and faulty punctuation....
Oliver B.: It has all the mellow charm of the season:
Well, look at this for a dinner.
There were about umpteen hundred un ten.
As for the best looking, wait I’ll pick the winner,
We are all related, says old farmer Ben.
It was just so, you’ll be in the know,
As I describe the whole lot;
You couldn’t miss old Ben for his mo,
And Auntie with a face as ’ot as ’ot—
Ah, I mustn’t forget the great-grandfathers,
Or the great-great-grandmothers ;
I can tell you it took some lining up,
Even right down to wee little pups.
Yes, upon my wird, never saw such a crowd.
What! All related! Yes, all related.
My wird, that’s enough to make one feel proud,
And old Ben wouldn’t stand being dictated.
Of course, there was uncles and aunties,
And all their lot, great numbers;
One old maid, Aunt Susie,
And only one dear old batehlor they call Cuc-uro
ber.
. ...J.M. (Healesville) : It’s a bit worse than inert
commonplace J.H.A.: Not up Crispie: Thin
sort of yarn Mary M.: Too weak G.A.C.:
Hardly enough interest Grace L.: You don’t con-
trive to say it E.S.S.H.: Not up P. J.S.:
AVanted less fluff and more 5ki11.... Bungalook:
Practically the same as another on the same theme.
Lieb: Doesn’t arrive W.W.: Poor verse; old
gag Try Plane: Doesn’t strike u5....E.H. (E.
Malvern) : Too slight.... Blossom: Poor stuff
FI.A.S.: Doesn’t say enough... .S.F.V.: Without
mirth or melody.... Senga Zeni: Don’t like it....
J.J.H.: Lines built mostly out of a repetition of
“doth” are not promising Syd. S.: “The Whistle”
isn’t exciting Ecce: Poor in its poor class
M.P.H.: No use. Can’t advise you: you’ll have to
find your own path Bernard B.: Commonplace.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
A.S.P.: All miss... .E.M.: Badly overdoing the color
in the faces. .. .E.M.8.: Gags and draw’ings both
weak S.S.: Lady with curvature of the spine led

More tyre quality
for less money
CONSIDER the present prices for Goodyear
Cord Tyres—-never were they so low !
It now costs no more to buy Goodyears than
many unknown and inferior brands.
Think, too, of the superior quality of Goodyear
Cord Tyres—never was it so high!
With such a combination—high quality and low
price—is there any reason why you should
not fit Goodyear Cord Tyres to your Car?

“Pro” : The theory advanced by “Blanco”
(B. 9/11/’22), that bunchy top is the result
of trying to grow tropical plants in a tem-
perate climate, is rather discounted by the
fact that this disease is unknown in County
Cumberland, where banana groves have been
adorning the landscape for a century or
more.

The Australian is rarely cited as a shining
example of thrift, yet in some respects he
holds the world’s record. On October 31
last the number of depositors in the Savings
Banks of Australia (not including the Sav-
ings Department of the Commonwealth,
whose measly interest doesn’t warrant
patronage, anyway) was 2,502,275, and the
balance to the credit of depositors on that
date was £125,117,319.

“Centurion”: A Capetown cable states
that successful efforts are being made to ex-
port fish, fresh-canned and cured, to Aus-
tralia, and a 40-ton shipment is spoken of
as having been already made. What makes
the project surprising is that South African
fish are inferior to our own in quality, as well
as being much scarcer. S.A.’s staple fish is
snook, which is nothing more or less than bar-
raeouta. The fried-fish-shops in Capetown
and Jo’burg certainly display mountains of
cold fried soles, but I fancy these are im-
ported. In any case, the Jews consume
the total output. I asked for one of these
soles in a little eating-house off Adderley-
street, Capetown, at the-end of the South
African War, and was told that they were
reserved for the shop’s Yiddish cuthtomerth.
The fact that cheap Malays monopolise the
S.A. fishing industry may provide a clue to
the Capetown co.’s venture.

“Ashmead”: Four years ago Charles
Prouse, an osmiridium-digger near the Nine-
teen-Mile Creek, Heazlewood district, west
coast, Tas., unearthed a nugget Weighing 2dz.
3dwt. Last month he folind the largest nug-
get yet recorded, 4oz. Sdwt. It is worth
over £l2O at £27 10s. an ounce. The Speck
is the largest producer of osmiridium in the
world, Russia coming about next with a pro-
duct which contains a too large percentage of
platinum for pen-point use. The greatest
output in Tas. was 2009.1960 z., worth
£77,114. in 1920. Last year it was
1750.6550 z., valued at £42,935.
* ■ * * *
“Splinter”: On the Clarence River
(N.S.W.) there is enough timber of the right
size to supply poles for every hydro-electric
development scheme at present contemplated.
Incidentally, enough of it has been destroyed
to have kept those responsible for the destruc-
tion in everlasting flames. It is wonderful
timb°r, with lanky hardwood trees that would
give 50ft. to 60ft. poles in abundance. Yet in
Maoriland the Power Boards that look after
hydro-electric development are at present un-
decided whether they will take any more
timber from Australia or import Canadian
cedar. It’s largely our own fault, too. Quite
a lot of the poles shipped from N.S.W. have
proved mere rotten sapwood that has had to
be replaced within two years. The N.S.W.
Forestry Department brand on export timber
does not warrant the article sound, but merely
signifies that it is a particular kind of timber.
“0.D.”: It is estimated that there are
18.000,000 sheep in Queensland, and that the
value of the production from the industry in
1921 was close on £8,000,000. The losses
in sheep from dingoes during the year were
reckoned at 231,906, but it was the deadly
blowflv that exacted the greatest toll:
562,417. Which shows the inscrutable ways
of Nature. Nov/, if the blowflies would only
attack the dingoes!
THE POWER OF THE PRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I have just received from Russia £5 worth of
roubles—that is 90,000,000 roubles. When I left
Moscow in February I received 2,000,000 roubles for
the £ sterling. This enormous further decline in
rouble values is accounted for by the simple financial
policy of the Bolshevik Chancellor of the Exchequer.
At the end of each month, after discovering the cur-
rent deficit, he merely balances the ledger by telling
the printing presses to go ahead until things are
straight again 1” — Professor Meredith Atkinson.
In times of stringency and stress,
When tenth-rate politicians
Have got the State in such a mess
That even Oppositions
Discover that they can’t appraise
The actual situation,
Or show the way out of the maze,
What is the method nowadays,
By which to save the nation?
Eh? Can’t you guess?
Why, trust the Press!
’Twill extricate us from the mess.
When trade is dull and loans are few,
And taxes ineffective;
When squandered millions fall due
In one long, black perspective;
When unemployment stalks the land,
And credit is restricted;
When in the dole-queues workers stand,
And that great Crisis seems at hand
Which pessimists predicted—
The printing press
Will stop distress,
And save the land from wretchedness.
What matter if the cash runs short,
Or if the loans be stinted?
The Treasurer’s a good old sport,
And notes are quickly printed.
I tell you, comrades, we are saved,
So come! Keep up your peckers.
Much needless odium we’ve braved—
Aid very foolishly we’ve raved
About dead-broke exchequers.
To ease the stress
Turn to the Press
And make a billion, more or less,
Eureka l What a lucky chance,
The Premier should have read it!
Now, we can make a new advance
And stabilise our credit;
Get in more paper, oil and ink;
And carking care to banish!
Just order up another drink—
It’s splendid, man 1 Why, only think,
The deficit will vanish!
While all men bless
The puissant Press,
Remover of indebtedness.

. Mennen’s?
What I like about men in Aus-
tralia and NewZealandis that they
are not penny wise and pound
foolish. Mennen Shaving Cream
costs them 2d. more a month than
hard soap. I’ll admit it. At the
same time I’ll admit that Mennen’s
is well worth the difference. The
extra comfort, the extra confi-
dence, the extra cordiality that
comes with the 120 shaves in a
Mennen tube is worth as many
pounds as the pennies that might
be saved each month.
As one of my enthusiastic
friends says," I’m not arguing, I’m
only telling you.” The test is in
the tube. The tube is in every
good shop that stocks toilet pre-
parations. It’s your move.

Adelaide lias lost its oldest inhabitant, a
date-palm growing in the lawn between Par-
liament House and the river. There seems
to be no doubt that it was growing on Kan-
garoo Island before S. Aus. was christened.
It was brought to the infant city originally
in a pot, by W. L. Beare.
“E.K.”: A big cane-block on a plantation
in Bundaberg is noted throughout the sugar
belt for the number of snakes it harbors. As
the chippers go forward with their hoes the
snakes keep working back in massed forma-
tion, and men who lag behind the leaders get
a lesson on natural history. They work in
that gang.
“Pat Bushie”: “Wilfrido’s” comments (B.
7/12/’22) on counsel repeating a question
with “Do you swear that?” reminds me. The
cross-examination had lasted 20 minutes, and
the solicitor had clinched his questions with
the addendum again and again. At last the
witness tired of it. “Bring back that Bible;
he has forgotten I’m on oath,” was his way
of abating the annoyance.
The fund to erect a national statue in
Adelaide to honor Matthew Flinders, dis-
coverer of S. Australia, totals, up to. date,
£1740. Fred Johns (“Who’s Who”) is hon.
secretary of the fund, and a hard worker
in its interests. He has recently issued a
seven-and-sixpenny book of 150 pages, en-
titled “A Journalist’s Jottings,” the whole
proceeds of which are to go to the statue
fund.
“Pat Bushie”: A bank-teller friend pro-
duced a split one-pound note, showed it
to a cobber and myself, and praised the dex-
terity of the fingers of the craftsman who
had performed the deed. My companion
laughed, produced a new note and a pin,
and soon had an inch of the note split. Hav-
ing tried it, I find the operation a simple
one—but how do crooks manage to pass the
pieces? The paper is quite white on one side
when the note is split.
“G.”: “No sell so many fine cray,”
Demetrius complained one night when busi-
ness was slack. Since the pubs were closed
at 6 there are fewer late drunks catching
last trains with crayfish in their pockets.
Beer seemed to demand cray as its natural
affinity; but what is the right complement of
the gaseous pink and green liquids from the
soda-fountain? Probably the temperance
man, who has no soul anyway, returns home
in all his sober self-sufficiency with nothing
more romantic to display than a box of jubes
or a slab of ice-cream in a packet.
. “F. Clinton”: I rise to contradict “Gippo,”
who asserts (B. 23/11/’22) that couch will
beat buffalo in a mixed lawn. Let him take
a look at any of the lawns in Sydney Botanic
Gardens, and he will find that wherever
buffalo has been introduced it has got a
stranglehold on couch, and everything else.
It will even give clover a rough spin, and
clover will choke a couch lawn out of exist-
ence in a couple of years. Lawns of pure
couch are rare. Tennis-courts and bowling-
greens consist of mixed grasses intended to
give an even growth throughout the year.
“Nitric”: A letter from a bucolic patron
of our firm arrived the other day. He de-
sired a village pump, had sent up measure-
ments, and the instrument of suction had
been forwarded to him :—-
Dear Sir, —I wish to tell you emphatically and
verbally that your pump is wrong. It does not fit
the main pipe, though the measurements of the pipe
were given you right. The pump does not fit. If
the measurements are wrong I will pay for the
pump ; if not, you should ante up—Yours faithfully,
D.T.
P.S. —It’s alright, me son made the pump fit.
Note two rural characteristics —a sporting
offer and a kindly postscript.
“B.” : It is a well-established fact that the
greatest menace to the middle-aged is cancer
—fully 25 per cent, of Australians who die
in the fifties are victims to this disease. It
has been noticed in S. Aus. that those asso-
ciated with the pig industry, and those who
have a partiality for pork, are particularly
liable to internal growths. The Old Testa-
ment was strongly denunciatory regarding the
meat of swine for human consumption. Do
many Jews die of cancer? No bribe can in-
duce some sects (such as the Seventh Day
Adventists) to eat “the flesh of the hog.”
They maintain that it still contains its objec-
tionable properties when cured and put on
the table as fried bacon.
The first annual report of the Common-
wealth Institute of Science and Industry,
Melbourne, begins by drawing attention to
the fact that—
This report is printed on paper made by the
Institute of Science and Industry at Geelong (through
the courtesy of the Australasian Paper and Pulp
Co., Ltd.). It is the result of one of the Insti-
tute’s semi-commercial tests on the pulping and
paper-making qualities of Australian woods. It is
manufactured from pulp consisting of 60 per cent,
“soda” pulp made from Victorian timbers, mountain-
ash, silvertop and woollybutt, and of 40 per cent,
imported “sulphite” pulp.
Other Australian industries might imitate
this idea of crowing over their achievements.
But this is not the first demonstration of
our ability to manufacture newsprint. A
supplementary issue of the Sydney Gazette
of July 29, 1820, was printed on paper made
by Messrs. Fisher and Duncan, who had
established a mill in the vicinity of the
present corner of Elizabeth-street and
Bourke-street. The mill was driven by
water-power.
“A.8.W.”: The vet.’s view as against the
doctor’s: —
“Min Yip’s” assertion (B. 30/11/’22) that the
bacillus botulinus is the cause of the diseases of
animals known as forage poisoning, dry bible, etc.,
is open to question. Dr. Seddon, of Melbourne Uni.
Vet. School, calls the bacillus in this group of
diseases para-botuiinus, but does not claim that it
is identical with Van Emmergem’s bacillus botulinus.
In “forage poisoning” various well-known fungi un-
doubtedly play an important part, and other organ-
isms (certainly not B. botulinus), are under suspicion.
Writer has seen cases of undoubted forage poison-
ing and impaction paralysis where the feed was appa-
rently sound and of good quality, and, conversely,
animals fed on mouldy and mouse-infected chaff where
no harm resulted. While the mortality from botulism
in humans is only about two-fifths p.c., very few cases
of forage poisoning or impaction paralysis, in horses
and cattle, recover with or without treatment. Your
correspondent sounds the right note in advocating
steps to prevent the feeding of damaged fodder to
valuable stock, but much research work will have
to be done before the true cause of this group of
strange diseases is ascertained.

DO you think of them as
comparatively unimport-
ant parts of your motor,
so far as lubrication is con-
cerned ?
Remember, the oil that gets to
the cams and valves is the same
oil that has to overcome friction
and resist the intense heat in the
cylinders.
Every part of your motor is a
major part. Every part needs the
best of lubrication.
Texaco Motor Oil does full jus-
tice to all.
Texaco Motor Oil in the cylin-
ders coats the surfaces perfectly,
because it has the right body. It
holds the compression. It pre-
vents the metal-to-metal contact
that , causes undue wear. It does
not form hard carbon. Texaco
Motor Oil on the bearings keeps
them, cool—keeps them working
smoothly.
You’ll know the luxury of a
perfectly-tuned motor always.

Texaco—the clean,

The Strange Case of Edward
Sibblethwaite.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
influences responsible for domestic
infelicity and the moral collapse of
men previously regarded as of irre-
proachable habit are singularly varied. Fre-
quently they are romantic; occasionally, as
in the case of some unbridled passion for
fretwork or bowls, merely foolish. Most
of them, however, come under one or another
recognised group heading. Of those out-
standing, that leading to the downfall of
Sibblethwaite, and ultimately to his demise,
must surely be reckoned the most odd.
Death caught Edward Sibblethwaite in a
characteristic moment —he died in his bath.
There was evidence that he had given him-
self his customary preliminary soaping and
was enjoying a moment of warm recumbency
when the unsuspected heart trouble betrayed
him. A last convulsive gesture had appa-
rently snatched at the chain of the plug,
for the bath was empty when his shocked
relatives discovered him. And there was
the unfortunate man—doubtless with a more
than usual air of having stepped out of the
Old Testament, smelling faintly of his
favorite brand of cloudy ammonia, the news-
paper wrapping which Mrs. Sibblethwaite
afterwards recalled having neglected to re-
move from the fresh bottle of this requisite
on its arrival from the grocer’s crumpled
tight in his stiff lingers—mercifully at rest-
It would be pleasant to be able to
relate that the bath in which Sibble-
thwaite died was that in which he had
soaped himself so often, the one at
The Nook, Boronia-avenue, Cremorne.
Unhappily, it was a smaller, somewhat mot-
tled and altogether inferior bath, which lie
used by formal arrangement with a Mrs.
Belcher, of Balmain. He had been living in
Balmain at this period for some three years.
It was a depressing house —one of a depress-
ing row, differing from its neighbors only
inasmuch that in the asphalt space termed
front garden there was imprisoned a soot-
stained mulberry-tree; but that the Sibble-
thwaites were in a position to find harbor
even here was only by virtue of Mrs. Sibble-
thwaite’s small private income, for with his
moral undoing Sibblethwaite had inevitably
become financially undone too.
A sad case, Sibblethwaite’s, and a peculiar
one. Here was a man, outwardly normal,
whose every action hitherto had been charac-
terised by deliberatioji and balance, in whom
a sense of family duty was developed to a
degree almost morbid ; but a man who, for-
sooth, having arrived at a point from which
he might review more than half a lifetime
of exemplary behavior, must needs mark it
by falling victim to excesses so strange as
to constitute an absolutely unrecorded vice.
I had known him for some time before I
came to know him at all intimately—we had
filled with desultory talk the half-hour taken
to cross the harbor for several years before
he invested the relationship with significance
one morning by inviting me to stroll over the
following Saturday to inspect his White
Leghorns. They .were ordinary enough look-
ing birds, and it seemed to me that, consid-
ering the heat of the day, we spent more
than sufficient time in their vicinity ; but it
was the peculiar something that came into
Sibblethwaite’s rather protuberant eyes as
he flung them a bit of greenstuff, the odd
note that crept into his cotton-woolly voice
as he clucked kindly at the foolish things,
that first hinted to me with what inordinate
pride and fondness he regarded such tokens
of his talent for domesticity. A small thing,
maybe, but portion of a background lending
the affair extraordinary pathos. That they
were more than just hens to Sibblethwaite
I sensed even at the time. I know now that
they stood rather for flocks and herds and
that rich retinue of animal possessions of
which there is made such unctuous mention
in accounts of persons of substance in the
Bible.
For that was the wonderful thing about
Sibblethwaite —the perfection with which he
had managed to preserve, after more than 40
years in the enervating atmosphere of Syd-
ney, the true aroma of wet Sunday after-
noons at Little Piffleton (Hants.), of acid-
drops and mothballs and devotional readings,
especially of readings touching the more
prolific personages of the Scriptures. The
Sibblethwaite union had been blessed eight
times in all, and, as I came to know him bet-
ter, Sibblethwaite frequently reconstructed
for me the circumstances in which this or that
little Sibblethwaite had first seen the light. As
to Mrs. Sibblethwaite, a somewhat remarkable
arrangement of the eyebrows had given her
an illusive air of regarding her family and
life in general as matters for chronic sur-
prise. She was nevertheless a rather per-
sonable little woman, with a figure still
comely despite the obligations incurred by
her affections. And the sight of her was
especially grateful on the occasion now re-
ferred to, for it was at her suggestion that we
eventually retired from the effluvious neigh-
borhood of the fowls and made our way to
the bathroom as a preliminary to tea.
It is impossible, if one is to speak really
illuminatively of Sibblethwaite, to omit these
references to personal toilet. One might
simply say, of course, that we went indoors
to tea, making no mention of his ablutional
rites en route, but it would be to ignore cer-
tain phases of his character of possibly no
small significance in relation to the matter
under discussion. Nor, to be frank, is it
easy to deny oneself mention of happenings
which made upon one so profound an impres-
sion. For to see Sibblethwaite preparing
himself for the table was a very fascinating
thing.
“Hot or cold?” he queried, one hand poised
hospitably over the faucets, and his cotton-
woolly voice borrowing from the improved
acoustics a richer timbre. It was imma-
terial, I assured him, hitching up my jacket
at the wrists and making perfunctory use
of the green cake of medicated soap. Then,
turning to dry my hands, I started. Sibble-
thwaite had removed his coat and waistcoat,
rolled up his shirt sleeves and tucked them
under his heliotrope arm-garters, unsprung
his made-up bow, and was unriveting his
collar at the neck.
One felt abashed and a little resentful —•
that be was altogether exaggerating the occa-
sion ; but almost simultaneously one was
possessed by the man’s air of sensuous aban-
don. Here, one could not but feel, was
revealed not merely a rather bony person
with intricate braces, about to cleanse him-
self with ill-timed thoroughness, but a man
about to indulge a passionate appetite
already too long denied.
It was in Sibblethwaite’s bathroom, I re-
cognised long afterwards, that there was
vouchsafed to me the first indication
of his latent capacity for extreme and
extravagant conduct. At the time, however,
I was principally impressed by the fact that
he had stripped the upper part of his person
to a species of blue-veined undervest, and
was testing the temperature of the water in
the basin with a view to washing at least
his face and neck. Soon these were en-
veloped in an exuberant aromatic lather,
with which he so searched the corners of his
ears that he was unwittingly bawling such
remarks as it had occurred to him to address
to me. Followed rich swillings, the removal
of the plug, and a temporary lull, while the
water charged with the impurities thus re-
moved gurgled softly to the drain. Finally
came a re-charging of the basin from the
cold tap, more luxurious swillings (marked
by sounds of air being alternately sucked
and expelled enjoyably through the teeth), a
punctilious five minutes with the towel,
gradual reassociation with braces, arm-garters
and so op, and by dignified stages the rehabili-
tation of Sibblethwaite as I had known him.
It was obvious to me later that the incident
had a psychological significance, and even at
the: time it struck me as strange in relation
to a man ordinarily punctilious as to the
finer points of good taste; but now we were
making our way to the dining-room, where
the whole Sibblethwaite family was gathered
in feeding formation. A smile of welcome
from Mrs. Sibblethwaite, a ripple of self-
consciousness over the faces of the children,
and I had sunk into the seat provided for me
and Sibblethwaite into his place at the head
of the table, A glance by my host to right
and left, a raising of the carving-knife over
the cold mutton, in the manner of an orches-
tra leader with his baton, and the meal was
in progress.
Both Sibblethwaite and his wife ate with
zest, and each child, it was patent, was pre-
occupied with the business of losing as little
time as possible in qualifying itself for the
rich-looking slab of rainbow cake. For a
while brief politenesses constituted the con-
versation. Then, as repletion commenced
to dull the sensibilities making for constraiht,
verbal exchange became brighter and more
frequent, and to Sibblethwaite’s ponderous
jocularities the children were emboldened to
toss perky reply. And gradually there
sprang into being that species of game in-
dulged in by families entertaining a new
guest; in which the conversation, like the
dialogue of a play, consists of a series of
cues, and each remark is made the vehicle
for such items of family intelligence as a
polite visitor may be assumed to be inter-
ested'in. Thus, when little Alwyn (possessing
Sibblethwaite’s horse-like face in miniature,
and clearly his father’s favorite), said in
his prattling way that he wished he were a
man that he might have a ring “with pic-
tures on it like daddy’s,” Sibblethwaite smiled
at me in a deprecating way and made pretence
of silencing the child ; and Wattle, the eldest
little girl, said they weren’t pictures—they
were a crest; and Sibblethwaite, thereby en-
titled to enlarge upon a subject which he
could not himself in modesty have introduced,
drew the ring from his finger and traced for
me with transparent nonchalance the sym-
bols constituting the Sibblethwaite coat-of-
arms. By these means one’s attention was
drawn to a number of things reflecting inter-
estingly on the Sibblethwaites in one way or
another—a plaque embellished with cigar
bands, a charcoal study of stags by the child
Wattle, a bundle of spears entrusted to little
Alwyn by an intoxicated ship’s steward, and
(subsequently and privately, as between just
Sibblethwaite and me) a calculus reputed to
have caused great agony to Mrs. Sibble-
thwaite’s aunt.
If I was quite sure I wouldn’t have another
cup of tea, suggested Mrs. Sibblethwaite
eventually.... and on my assurance rang two
tinkles on her bell. And a female of lower
order, who had been coming and going on
trivial - errands. throughout the meal, came
and removed all pertaining to it-, placing
on the vacant space, as in simple tribute to
a thing that had been but now had ceased to
be, an aspidistron in a yellow pot.
It was as we made our way out on to the
verandah that there occurred the incident
constituting my first real warning of Sibble-
thwaite’s abnormality. Mrs. Sibblethwaite
had retired for a moment to the kitchen, and
the children, with the exception of the child
Wattle, had dispersed to such innocent occu-
pations as the meal had interrupted. Punc-
turing the quiet of the mellow summer even-
ing came occasional sounds of glee or protest
—-from Janet and Hilda at hopscotch, from
Edward and Wilberforce tutoring the parrot
in the game of “hosings,” from little Alwyn
decapitating worms. The child Wattle I
had thought also to be at play, until from one
of the long verandah chairs came the rustle
of the evening paper, and her lisping accents:
“Listen, Daddy. See if I can spell.”
She had chosen for purpose of demonstra-
tion an advertisement that was at that time
figuring largely in the daily press.
“ ‘Why I Buy Bodger’s Bacon,’ ” she
enunciated, with pretty laboriousness. “ ‘One
Hundred Pounds for the Best’ ”
Like a flash the man had grated to his
feet—like a flash and with inconceivable
roughness he had torn the sheet from the
startled child’s hand. And in a voice scarce
recognisable for its harshness he bid the
trembling mite ’join the others at their
games.
So unexpected was it, so cruelly uncalled
for, that I could not dissemble a look of in-
credulity and disgust. Then, as I saw the
remarkable disorder of his features, I sud-
denly felt unaccountably sorry for the man.
It was the expression of scarcely a moment,
succeeded almost instantly by signs of acu-
test remorse. A terrible expression—such as

HOLIDAY ACCIDENTS
AND SKIN TROUBLES.
Don’t Forget Zam-Buk when Packing Your Kit.
Bore feet, chafed heels and

You have only to
send your name
a nd addresss
(mentioning The
Bulletin) to the
Proprietors , C.
E. Fulford (A/sta), Ltd., Sydney,
when you will promptly receive a
free sample of Zam-Buk, sufficient for
a trial on any cut or wound.
2 UPPOSE, during the holidays, you, or one of
your family, meet with an accident! What are
you going to do? If you are wise, you will prepare
for such emergencies by having a box of antiseptic
Zam-Buk with you. As a "first-aid” there is nothing
that can compare with Zam-Buk—nothing that
ends pain, stops bleeding, and draws out soreness
so quickly. Zam-Buk soothes, purifies and heals
your injuries and prevents them festering up.
Again, you never need to have a holiday spoiled by the tortures
or sunburn, rashes or swellings if you have Zam-Buk at hand. This
pure herbal balm cools a fiery, sunburnt skin, ends the tingling and
smarting, allays the soreness, and prevents blistering. Zam-Buk is
equally good for sore feet, mosquito bites, cuts, bruises, sprains and
ail skin injuries and eruptions.
Sunburnt While Swimming.
My pastime during summer is swimming,”
writes Mrs. Plaines, of 389 King Street, West
Melbourne, and one hot day my baek got badly
sunburnt. My skin was very sore and tender,
and I suffered severely. I always keep Zam-Buk
m the house, and I had the balm applied to rav
back night and morning. The first application of
Zam-Buk allayed the irritation and took the
heat right out.”
Itching Prickly Heat
“Last summer I had a severe attack of
prickly heat,” writes Mrs. E. Cook, of Kennedy
Terrace, Brisbane. “It was impossible to keep
my hands away from the itchy surfaces. One
day I got a box of Zam-Buk, and the soothing,
cooling sensation it produced was really amazing.
Zam-Buk soon dried up the eruptions and re-
placed all old diseased tissue with a splendid
growth of smooth, clear skin.”

Zam-Buk.
Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap
should be used in Summer in preference to
ordinary toilet soaps, because, with the
greater activity of the pores, and conse-

liable to itchiness, smarting patches, rash

of Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap prevent these
troubles by thoroughly cleansing the skin

Muttering something about the pernicious
effects of modern advertising, the impres-
sionable nature of a child’s mind and a
stroll, lie went in search of his hat, palpably
for the purpose of recovering something of
his old.nary aplomb. 1 had wiped the vapor
from his daughter’s spectacles on his return
and quelled in a measure her sniffings ; but
long after she had retired to the garden and
long after we had returned from a spirited
tour of the environs the episode of the news-
paper exercised my mind. What, I asked
myself, as I eventually made my way home-
ward, should there be m a simple newspaper
advertisement to arouse m Sibblethwaite so
passionate a protest, so strange a look ot
dreai!. And as I put my head out of my
bedroom window for a moments final con-
ference with the stars, again I asked my-
t,' 7 ' at ’

Gremorne I was out of town, and conse-
queutly saw nothing of Sibblethwaite what-

shocking air of deflation, a dozen little odd-

influence on the evening I have referred to,

Mechanically, dispiritedly, lie touched on
those subjects which it was Ins wont to des-
cant on with such verve—the bridge, our
legislature, the parlous condition ot his kid-
neys. I here was an air of tension about
the man ol pre-occupation It was only as
we made our way through the turnstile that
he gave me the impression of speaking with
any sort of interest or sincerity. Then—
hurriedly, anxiously and with little blood-
choked veins showing unpleasantly at the
corners of his eyes,, he suggested that if I
happened to be near his office during the
day 1 might look in-he would like to have a
And such was the peculiar urgency of his
manner that I determined to find the leisure
to see him at all costs. There was
something at once homely and redolent of
adventure about Biddle s Buildings, from its
ietterbox-riddled door to the vases of plaster
grapes on its facade. There was an atmo-
sphere—atmosphere in the imaginative sense,
?i ne S’?#, separate from that resulting from
the Biddle .habit of keeping its garbage-tins
on the stairs. The Biddle tenantry, on the
other hand, was not especially select, nor
were, the suites particularly commodious or

In these circumstances the sign (in dirty

i «• nf" 10 u Austral Novel-
ties. hi. Sibblethwaite, Manager, it read,
“Don’t Knock.” A child would scarcely
have been deceived by the spec-bus air of
importance; as for knocidng, it was evi-
dently a door that people usually opened
with their feet. I negotiated it as directed
without preamble, and entered the room.
I am addicted to rubber soles, and
my advent was for a moment unnoticed,
Stacked everywhere, in numbers beyond
compute, were the boxes of picture frames,
boot-trees, conjuring sets, alarm-clocks and
what-not trafficked in by Sibblethwaite for a
living. In the midst of these---not sorting or
counting or wrapping them or doing with them
any other sort of nimble and interested
thing, but seated at a roll-top desk feverishly
scanning what appeared to he a large news-
paper cutting—was Sibblethwaite himself,
j CoU ghed, and with a start eloquent of his
absorption and his reduced nervous con-
dition he became aware of my presence, at
the same time managing to draw his sleeve
ovel . the paper with which he had been busy,
j could not nevertheless fail to catch a
gp m p Se 0 f its bold-type heading. “How
Manv Articles Can You Find in This Pic-
tnre Beginning with ‘S’?” it ran. “Hand-

Like a flash there came back to my mind

peculiar jarring laugh ;and'with no’ pretence

silence that I lacked the ingenuity to break.
Then, with startling suddenness, he sat up
straight.
“Busy !” he reiterated, loudly and passion-
ately. “God forgive me, Biittercluck”—mv
name is Clutterbuck—“yes.”
He snatched up the newspaper cutting,
and with a vehemence utterly foreign to
him thrust it roughly in my face,

SWO re to myself for the hundredth time that
I would conquer my subjection to it. Then
coming down on the tram this morning I
caught sight of the thing over a girl’s slaoul-
der and I saw a saucepan and a ship that I
hadn’t picked up before, making my total
just on two hundred. And now it’s got hold
of me again, and I suffer such illusions as

He sank back in his chair and mopped up
the beads of moisture that had started from
his brow. Clearly the constant battle with a
thing that he recognised in his more lucid
moments as a moral and even a financial
menace had left him singularly unmanned,
But was he not exaggerating the atla.r. Sup-
posing, I suggested, he were after all to win?
I wished almost that I had not spoken,
His momentarily frank gaze shifted, and
shame encarmined his features.
"I shan’t win,” he said—so low that I
could scarcely catch the words. “I’ve never
won. And I’ve been like this a long time,
Other things. ... trade names and slogans.”
And then 1 understood.
The memory of Sibblethwaite’s confession
is even now so painful a thing that my pen
falters at even a summary of the facts it
divulged. It appeared that an appeal for
a caption advertising the merits of Nugent’s
Nerve Nibs had first focussed his attention
on the quantity of money ostensibly to be
picked up by an ordinarily intelligent per-
son who did not grudge an occasional half-
hour of concentrated thought. I forgot what
lie tendered as a slogan for Nerve Nibs —
something apparently quite futile in the
opinion of the Nugent Proprietary, but suffi-
cient to set Sibblethwaite on a course from
which he never succeeded in retracing his
steps. What the man must have gone through
even up to the time of his confession one
can only surmise, but I have seen with my
own eyes 184 cartons of Moffatt’s Musks —
“the Musk with the Milled Edge”—from
which he had detached the portion which
must accompany entries in the name con-
test in connection with the liquorice discs
which the firm was then contemplating put-
ting on the market. When one considers
that each packet stood for at least lialf-an-
hour’s arduous thought, time stolen from
Austral Novelties, and, therefore, inimical
to Sibblethwaite’s peace of mind ; and when,
having computed this, one multiplies it by
the certainly large number of such things
by which lie had allowed his interest to be
inveigled, one gets some idea of what he
must have suffered.
That afternoon he told me everything, and
I think felt better for the telling. As to
advice, so lacking was my experience in any-
thing approximating to a precedent, that I
felt impotent. Looking back, I can see quite
clearly that Sibblethwaite’s case was even
then one for an alienist, but the conviction
had not crystallised, and the thought
is, in any case, one demanding some temer-
ity for its expression. It was with a feeling
of both awkwardness and helplessness that I
cventually bade him pull himself together and
made my way from the office.
Frorn this point onward Sibblethwaite
must have got steadily worse. My oppor-
tunities of judging were, unfortunately, in-
frequent, for I removed about this period to
a railway suburb and saw him but rarely,
It was some months later, while waiting for
a tram, that I caught sight of a figure
vaguely familiar bending over a public drink-
ing-geyser, and on approaching nearer re-
cognised the figure for his.
The change in the man . was deplorable,
Was this the Sibblethwaite who scarce a
year before I had seen in a pose so similar
at his ablutions? Alas, it indubitably was!
He regarded me dully: his manner was dis-
trait. He made no reference to the subject of
our previous conversation, and seemed, indeed,
impatient for me to be gone. Now and again
he glanced restlessly at the evening journal
which he had apparently been reading be-
fore the impulse had come, upon him to
slake his thirst. Unconsciously, my eye
followed his, and before the sheet had be-
come a tightly twisted cylinder in his ner-
vous fingers 1 had discerned portion of an
advertising announcement every
newspaper-reader at that period : “W hat U
the Plumber Saying? Substantial Reward
for the Best Phrase Featuring”
With a sudden intense feeling of pity I
remarked on the infrequency of our meet-
ings, and begged that he would name some
evening when I might drop in for a pipe,
lie evinced no enthusiasm at such a pros-
pect. He was living at Paddington now, lie
said. It was an unpleasant district. He
was afraid he was keeping me from my
tram.
I never saw Sibblethwaite again. My last
memory of him is the clamminess of his
hand on that occasion and the odd workings
of his mouth when not actually speaking,
as if in conversation with himself. Doubt-
less he was mumbling over trial phrases,
From what Mrs. Sibblethwaite told me after
the funeral it was about this time that he
became obsessed with the possibilities of
alliteration. To such a degree, she confided
to me, did this influence affect him that even
his ordinary speech was colored and per-
verted, so that he would reply to an inquiry
as to whether lie was ready for breakfast
with “Shortly, Charlotte, when I’ve shaved, ’
and fretfully bid the domestic, "Please, Polly,
be more punctilious with the porridge.”
A proud woman of extreme sensibility,
Mrs. Sibblethwaite did her utmost' to dis-
guise her husband’s condition, but the time
inevitably arrived when it was better that
Sibblethwaite should make no further pre*
tence of going to business, when he
spent his days about the house engaged in
such trivial occupations of a wholesome
nature as his wife could prevail upon him
to take an interest in. One of her most poig-
nant and tender memories of her husband,
Mrs. Sibblethwaite has told me, is of him
slipping lettuce leaves through the slit of
the boot-box in which he kept his silkworms,
A touching confession, and a pathetic tri-
bute to the quality of Mrs. Sibblethwaite’s
affection. Despite the shadow over their
lives and the financial straits to which they
were reduced, I believe that had it not been
for the gross carelessness of some clerk con-
nected with the publicity drive engineered
by Lippincott’s Liver Pills, the Sibble-
thwaites could have contrived a quiet happi-
ness together for many years,
It was the announcement of the result
of the Lippincott picture-puzzle contest, the
shock of reputed success, that killed Sibble-
thwaite.
Fate had ordained that the scrap of news-
paper wrapped round the bottle of toilet
ammonia previously referred to should be just
that portion declaring, quite erroneously,
that he was one of the 75S competitors
among whom it had become necessary to
divide the thirc. prize.
By some process which the Lippincott
people were never able properly to explain
his name had been confused with that or
one Podroyd- a name with which it had not
one solitary letter of the alphabet in common,
