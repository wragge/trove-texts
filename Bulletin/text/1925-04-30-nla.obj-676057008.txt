For

CAUTION.—The large sale of Eumenthol
Jujubes has led to a number of imitations
being manufactured . under the name of
menthol and other jujubes. It is important,
therefore, when buying to be sure to get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You mav
be asked to buy other jujubes, and be told
they are “just as good’’ as Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes. This proves that these imita-
tions and substitutes have no reputation of
their own, and can only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hudson’s
Eumenthol Jujubes.

Disease and Birth-Control
Once again the industrious Ettie Rout re-
turns to the charge in her latest book
( He.rual Health and Birth-Control, Pioneer
Press), and it is by far the best thing she
lias done —-the best-reasoned, the most con-
vincing. .It is possible that she makes a
mistake in attributing the whole of the
opposition to the prevention of syphilis to
tlie Church, for undoubtedly ministers of
religion are quite as fully alive to the urgent
necessity for prevention as it is possible
tor anybody to be; it is the whole reaction-
ary forces of society that we have to light—
the Church, the grandmothers, the politi-
cians, the morning papers: all that makes
tor “respectability.” For V.D. is a horrid
subject, and not to be mentioned in a draw-
ing-room. The only real method of advance
is to educate Up- public so that it. shall be
possible to discuss these things without
shame, just as we can discuss almost any
other of the dreadful facts of life without a
blush.
There is no doubt that by the use of
calomel ointment and thorough personal dis-
infection venereal disease may be entirely-
extirpated from the face of' the civilised
world within the space of one single genera-
tion ; as Sir Kay Lankester said only two
years ago: “Syphilis may be extirpated just
so soon as Governments make up their minds
to do it.” But the only way to do it is by
the use of calomel ointment, at the time of
risking infection. Once infected, long-
continued treatment is necessitated, and
then the results are by no means certain
even with our modern methods. It is purely
a, matter of teaching the boys how to protect
themselves, for sooner or later some good-
looking girl will smile to a hitherto pure
boy in the streets, and all else but his primi-
tive instincts are forgotten ; all his mother’s
teaching,,all his aspirations, all the natural
desire of a man for the one woman whom
he loves—it is a terrible fact of human
nature that in such circumstances a lad
often returns to the brute from which he
has ascended, and in a moment may ruin his
whole life, so that the world will never be the
same again for him. The problem rests en-
tirely with Governments and Education
Departments. It is simply a cruel and bar-
barous thing that a lad should be launched
into this world of harlots and syphilis with-
out knowing bow to protect himself.
But when Miss Bout comes to the ques-
tion of birth-control she is on more debat-
able ground. When the birth-controllers
decide upon a really satisfactory method,
satisfactory psychologically, physiologically
and anatomically, it will be reasonable to
discuss the ethics of the question; but so
far they quarrel among themselves like so
many theologians. A recent paper in the
American Mercury appears to consider that
it may be possible to immunise a woman to
the effects of the seminal fluid so that it
shall be impossible for her to become preg-
nant. But circumstances may so alter with
the presumptive parents that pregnancy may
become desirable,. and then it, may happen
that it may be impossible of occurrence. Miss
Rout herself seems to consider that a trifling
surgical operation is all that it is necessary';
but what will happen later on? It may pot
always be necessary or desirable to prevent
conception.
And how are you to tell to whom you are
denying the privilege of life, and why should
you deny it? That is the. real crux of birth-
control. For almost all the great geniuses
have been either psychopaths or bodily in-
firm. Beethoven was looked upon as crazy.
Luther was for a time so neurasthenic that
his enemies said he was insane. Mozart had
tuberculosis of the kidneys, and, so did St.
Francis of Assisi. Carlyle is said to have
had a duodenal ulcer. Nietzsche was half-
crazy most of his life, and went mad towards
the end of it. St. rani was undoubtedly a
psychopath. In fact, it is difficult to name
a single really sane and healthy man of
genius. Keats suffered from tuberculosis of
the lungs, and it is possible that in the
natural euphoria which accompanies that
disease we may see the real source of the
ecstatic longing that appears in so much
of his love-poetry. And Spinoza should never
have been born, for his sister died of tuber-
culosis, and he himself died of consumption
at the early age of 42 while mystically en-
deavoring to reduce God to mathematics.
What would modern rationalism be without
Spinoza?
You notice that most of these geniuses
had tuberculosis. It is the one great disease
which is not incompatible with the very
highest original genius. As for syphilis I
never heard of it doing any good to anyone:
and I should certainly say that a history of
syphilis must debar a man from parenthood
for a good many years. But until we dis-
cover more about the real laws of heredity
it will seem probable that birth-control is a
risky experiment for the human race if it
wishes to keep its geniuses. The really sane
stodgy man does not lead humanity. More
often lie makes money and lives happy ever
after in his sanity and stodginess.
C. McL.
Bardolatry
Aubrey Beardsley, the young consumptive
who compassed the decadence of his day in
his black-and-white drawings, hit a large
nail on the head in declaring that “when an
Englishman has professed his belief in the
supremacy of Shakspeare amongst all poets,
he feels himself excused from the general
study of literature.” And Bernard Shaw
has hit the same nail in many of his articles
on Shaw in general and Shakspeare in par-
ticular. Forty years ago it was estimated
that 250 books and pamphlets had been writ-
ten on the Bacon-Shakspeare controversy
alone; now with the advent of the Essex
theory the number of controversial books
bids fair to double the figure. From this
it would seem that, without taking into
account the yearly output of books on Shaks-
peare and his plays, the E?iglish literary
man’s chief occupation and pride is in keep-
ing Shalcspeare’s flag firing.
The latest form of Bardolatry is Shaks-
peare on the stage. To put the Bard in
motley and make him strut before tlio foot-
ljf>ht« seems part of the tendency towards
dramatic reconstruction, which is intriguing
the minds of our modern dramatists, giving
I’lulhp Moeller his chance to display the
petticoats and poets that clung to George
band, and John Drill kwater his clue to the
character of Cromwell and Lincoln.
1' rank Harris was early afield in dramatis-
ing his conceptions of Shakspeare. “Shaks-
peare and I [is Love” consists of about 30
scenes loosely connected and divided arbi-
trarily into five acts and an epilogue. The
Lard appears to Frank as a gentle dreamer
Wlt » a generous and forgiving nature, a sen-
sual singer who sees infinity in a woman’s
glad-eye. ('kettle, fat and Falstaflian, the
mad-wag of the tavern troupe, earns his pity
and his gratitude. And Lyly, the master of
ornate speech, tones up the play with polished
periods. • Other dramatists meet their com-
panions to gossip and argue over a cup of
sack, while Shakspeare frets for Mary
l itton. This young maid of honor, half-
strumpet and half-angel, quick-witted and
outspoken to the point of coarseness, in-
trigues our William with her pretty sophis-
try, and cajoles him with her woman's lure.
Her falseness proves the spur to his creative
gifts, drives him down dark regions of de-
spair to end his days in demure domesticity.
Bernard Shaw lias contributed a burlesque
variation on the same theme in his “Dark
Lady of the Sonnets.” Coual O’Riordan re-
constructs Shakspeare's latter davs, spent
cn.efly in pious retirement at Stratford, pro-
bably with a bad digestion and an enlarged
hver, in his play, “Shakspeare’s End.” There
is little to commend this drama, save the
curious way in which the author depicts
Shakspeare striving after respectability.
More interesting is the play by Rubinstein
mid Rax. Tips follows on the lines of
Harris, but it is better conceived than his
the plot is more elaborate and the incidents
are more closely knit. Yet Shakspeare’s
character is not satisfying. He remains the
nebulous dreamer, the stultified lover, mourn-
ing the loss of his oallipygons queen. The
atmosphere of the theatre and the players is
cleverly evoked. Mary Fitton’s part is
swollen into prominence; but the portrayal
of her character, her faun-like fascination
is less convincing than that of Harris.'
Though this play differs in detail from the
few known facts of Shakspeare’s life, it is
not only interesting for the fresh reading
oiid presentation of inei-
dents in the life of the Bard, but engaging
by reason of'tlie vivid portrayal of his con-
temporaries and the vagrant lives thev led
in the purlieus and baser parts of England’s
histone city.
Clemence Dane is more honest than most
writers who have dramatised Shakspeare’s
life: she calls her play quite frankly, “Will
Shakspeare: An Invention in Four Acts.”
U hue it patterns largely on the plays already
mentioned. Miss Dane gives an added in-
terest by making Kit Marlowe Shakspeare’s
rival in the quest of the “Dark Lady.” She
shows the two poets as the greatest friends,
hut later makes Mary Fitton turn against
the more, introspective Shakspeare anil run
off with Marlowe, who in turn is killed by
his rival in a dark struggle at an inn—
presumably at Deptford, where the real Mar-
lowe was stabbed by Francis Archer. The
action of the plot is quick and vigorous; it
palpitates with keen emotion, and is inter-
spersed with* rich poetry. Grief moans above
the voice of passion when great hearts clash
m combat. Much that is noble in Shaks-
peare’s character finds fine utterance in this
play; but his faults are often sentimental-
ised. the writer’s hero-worship becoming hys-*
terical; and an otherwise good play is spoilt
by the royal ranting of the queen in the last
act.
One and all, then, British people proclaim
their idolatrous worship of Shakspeare.
(.ountless numbers have written books about
him, and so expressed their worship in de-
finite form. Each writer sees him differently
for each one reads a different character into
his works. What Shakspeare was like
exactly, how he lived and how he wrote, his
petty temptings and bursts of greatness, his
motives for love and hate, jealousy and re-
venge we shall never fully know. And this
is well; for surely there js greater pleasure
ill piquant surmise than cold truth, which
is so. often bitter. Conjecture is more fas-
cinating than fact; and the halo that sur-
mounts the greatest figure in English litera-
ture is kept bright and everlasting because
laitli is blind and lives in ignorance.

The Creed of the
Master Workman
The little machine shop of Joseph Boyer, where the dreams of
so many inventors had been realized, was the birthplace of
the first practical adding machine. William Seward Burroughs
was the genius who created the idea. Joseph Boyer, master
workman, materialized this idea into a serviceable and efficient
machine.
Throughout forty years of continuous growth and leadership—
under the constant and dominant influence of Joseph Boyer—
the Burroughs Adding Machine Company has rigidly main-
tained high quality ideals. His exacting mechanical standards
are reflected in every machine built.
No Burroughs machine has ever been made simply to sell.
Each is made to do its work better than it can be done by
any other method. That is why Burroughs has always been
the standard of excellence in figuring machine equipment—
that is why more than 850,000 Burroughs machines have been
sold throughout the world.
With such tradition in the past —with such standards and
guidance in the present —the Burroughs Adding Machine
Company will continue to make vital contributions toward
better business throughout the future.
To-day Burroughs factories located at Nottingham, England;
Windsor, Canada, and Detroit, U. S. A., and Burroughs
offices located in every civilized country on the globe are
serving the figuring needs of the world’s business men.

disaster.” Chance, he grants the Philoso-
pher, distributes good and bad luck more or
less evenly to everyone, but there are some
men who see and seize all their opportuni-
ties, and profit by them. Others will let
them slip. , _ , , .
The Philosopher counters by casting doubt
upon the greatness of past military com-
manders. To divorce the element of chance
from skill is impossible. “Not so,” replies
the Soldier. “Have we not known, during
the late war, leaders who succeeded and
leaders who were foredoomed to failure?
There were colonels who always went
straight for their objective; there wore
others who never did. Men like Petam,
Mangin, Fayolle got on because, other things
being equal, they obtained more results than
the rest.” “What!” demands the Philoso-
pher ; “is success, then, the only criterion !
Consider the case of Wellington. Suppose
he had been defeated at Waterloo. What
wouldn’t people have said about his faulty
dispositions, his pig-lieadedness, his negli-
gence? That ball the night before the battle
■—was there ever a finer example of the
‘damn-the-consequences’ spirit at head-
quarters? But Wellington won. and the his-
torians belaud his genius. Wouldn't they
be better advised to call it his good luck?”
The Soldier hedges, lie is a Frenchman
and Napoleon is his deity. An dr 6 Maurois,
in Captain and Kings (John Lane), gives
him the rank of lieutenant of the 7th
Dragoons, and the Philosopher is his one-
time tutor, a professor in a Paris Lycee.
“The most brilliant card-player may lose a
rubber,” he concedes, “and the best of gen-
erals lose a battle, for there are obstacles
which it is impossible to foresee.” Victory
is not the sole test of leadership. What he
maintains is that, given the same circum-
stances and the same resoui’ces to draw upon,
the great soldier will succeed where the lesser
man fails. “But,” says the Philosopher,
“when two opposing generals are brought
face to face, one of them must necessarily
be victorious.” Until Caesar appeared
on the scene, Pompey went on from triumph
to triumph. If Caesar had never lived, Pom-
pey would have continued Pompey the Great.
“And so it may be,” says the Philosopher,
“that during the whole of their existence
certain people are favored by Destiny, just
as at roulette you may find the red turning
up 15 times running.”
“This idea of Destiny,” replies the Soldier,
“strikes me as false and irrational,” and he
puts the attitude of men of action in a pic-
turesque passage. We must see them not
as men advancing through country already
mapped out, “but rather as leaning over
the brink of an obscure abyss in whose
depths are just discernible the vague and
inchoate forms of the future, rough-hewn
shapes which, if it be really their will, they
may chisel as they desire.” The Philosopher
questions whether the wall to build is suffi-
cient. In 1918 Ludendorff willed to pene-
trate the Champagne front. The future
may be wrought into some shapes but not
into all. “The man who is incapable of
confining his thoughts within these, sacred
and invisible limits is, in my opinion, not
the man to make a leader.” The Soldier
cannot agree to this. It under-values
“dash.” “My experience,” he says, “is that
in every sort of affair there conies an oppor-
tunity, sometimes a very fleeting one, of wan-
ning the day.” The territory of things pos-
sible he likens to an elastic surface which
the leader expands or contracts by his
patience or his weakness. The will of the
leader is the controlling power, and is exer-
cised through the quick, almost intuitive pro-
cess of seizing opportunity. “In action you
try to find out what is best for you to do at
a given point of time. An approximate, a
working solution arrived at then and there
is a thousand times better than a perfect
solution produced in a week’s time.” He
pictures Joffre seated before a map on which
arrows were stuck. “Joffre would often
come into this room, take a chair, and, sit-
ting astride it, gaze long and earnestly at the
map without uttering a word. Without
doubt at this moment he saw his battle, not
as an algebraist sees his problem, but like
a great stag gathering himself up for a
spring. The idea of the manoeuvre, the over-
whelming of Von Kluckfs right, the forma-
tion of Manoury’s army, had doubtless all
been thought out.” All that remained was
to give effect to his plan at the precise
moment when he could tie sure it would pro-
duce its maximum effect. He saw the chance
ripen to maturity, divined his opportunity
and struck.
Though Philosopher an*l Soldier discussed
other problems the place mid scope of leader-
ship in wrnr engrossed the greater part of
their attention. Out of the combat a few
concepts may be drawm. Agreed the gods
toss the chances. It is fa>r mortals to per-
ceive them, use them, and by quick resolu-
tion mould them to their pwrpose. It is not
an advance on the old stoic philosophy, but
a restatement of it in modern terms. The
dice are thrown for us “carefully and skil-
fully to make use of what is throwm.”

Francis Ledwidge
Dunsany found him road-mending in
Meath. He had sent Dunisany an exercise-
book of poems, poorly written, badly spelt
even, yet the deliberate, elegant Dunsany
went questing forth to find' the singing boy.
In one of his lesser poems' Ledwidge tells
the story of that meeting:—
I was just coming in from the garden or about to
go fishing for eels,
And smiling I asked you to pardon my boots very
low at the heels,
And I thought that you never woii’d go as you stood
in the doorway ajar,
For my heart would keep crying, “Old Clo’. you’re
found out at last as you are.*’
One can imagine readers say, “Is this the
rival of the chief poets of the age? But wait!
He went to Dublin to be. a grocer’s boy.
Young Pan in an alley! But Pan was not pri-
soned long. He broke away and walked the
80 miles that lay between him and his
mother’s house in the fialds. Yet Dublin
taught him something, too. Was this written
of his mistress in tho shop? Perhaps it was
not. for the shop was in Dublin: —
I brought in these to make her kitchen sweet,
Haw blossoms and the roses of the lane.
Her heart seemed in her eves so 1 wild! they beat
With welcome for the boughs of Spring again.
She never heard of Babylon or Troy,
She read no book, but once saw Dublin town,
Yet she made a poet of her servant boy,
And from Parnassus earned the laurel crown.
Dunsany became his fairy godfather, un-
selfish, kindly and provident. He sponsored
the new poet in his journalistic baptism. He
prefaced his poems. Young as he was, he
had published three books before his bush
of life was burnt. His bush of life, just
trembling into flower !
This is his description of the blackbird.
It must have been envy of the blackbird that
first stirred the lad of the lanes to song:—
And wondrous impudently sweet.
Half of him passion, half conceit,
The Mark bird calls adown the street,
Like the piper of Hamelin.
And this to a linnet: —
When Spring is in the fields that stained your wing,
And the blue distance is alive with song—
When that happens, when the “blue distance
is alive with, song,” he will let the linnet go.
The one the Americans appear to love
most of Ledwidge’s poems is “Desire in
Spring” :■ —
1 love the cradle songs the mothers sing
In lonely places when the twilight drops.
The slow, endearing melodies that bring
Sleep to the weeping lids; and when she stops
I love the roadside birds upon the tops
Of dusty hedges in a world of Spring.
But oven more beautiful, dreamily beautiful,
is his April song:—
The censer of %ie eglantine was moved
By little lane winds, and the watching faces
Of garden flowerets, which of old she loved,
Peep shyly outward from their silent places.
But when the sun arose the flowers grew bolder,
And she will be in white, I thought, and she
Will have a cuckoo on her either shoulder,
And woodbine twines and fragrant wings of pea.
And I will meet her on the hills of south.
And I will lead her to a northern water,
My wild one, the sweet, beautiful, uncouth,
The eldest maiden of the winter’s daughter.
And down the rainbows of her noon shall slide
Lark music, and the little sunbeam people,
And nomad wings shall fill the river side,
And ground winds rocking in the lily’s steeple.
In anthologies two other poems of his are
often seen. One is “The Wife of blew and
the other the haunting “Day Hangs Its Light
Between Two Dusks, My Heart.” Perhaps
the most beautiful, the most piercing of all,
is “The Lost Ones”: —
Somewhere is music from the linnets’ bills,
And through the sunny flowers the bee-wings drone,
And white bells of convolvulus on hills
Of quiet May make silent ringing, blown
Hither and thither by the wind of showers,
And somewhere all the wandering birds have flown,
And the brown breath of autumn chills the flowers.
But where are all the loves of long ago?
Oh, little twilight ship blown up the tide,
Where are the faces laughing in the glow
Of morning years, the lost ones scattered wide?
Give me your hand, oh brother, let us go
Crying about the dark for those who died.
No more is needed surely to prove his
claim to poethood. If more is needed, more
is there. As to his character, it is best re-
vealed in his letters. Katherine Tynan has
published what she received from him. Here
are some extracts :
If I survive the war I have great hopes of writing
something that will live. If not, I trust to be re-
membered in my own land for one or two things
that its long sorrow inspired.
And again this letter shows as clear as light
that Ledwidge wrote because he must: —
When I read the proofs of “Songs of Peace” there
were several poems that I hardly recognised as my
own, for I scribble them off in odd moments, and if
I do not give them to someone they become part of
the dust of the earth, and little things stuck on
hedges when the wind has done with them. My
manuscripts are scattered about two hemispheres,
some lost for ever, others wandering in the corners of
newspapers, like so many little Abrahams, changing
their names as if they had given over an old faith,
and were set on new endeavors. I lament in sober
momints and forget them again when some new tunc
breaks out in my mind.
The bills of home never left his mind. The
only use France was to him was to call
Meath back. There is but one face, one
country for the lover, be his love land or
lady. Listen to this:—
You are in Meath now, I suppose. If you go to
Tara go to Ratli-na-Ri and look all around you from
the hills of Drumcondra in the north to the plains of
Enfield in the south, where Allan Bog begins, and
remember me to every hill and wood and ruin, for
my heart is there. If it is a clear day you will
see Slane Hill blue and distant. Say that I will
come back again surely, and maybe you will hear
pipes in the grass or a fairy horn or the hounds of
Finn —I heard them often at Tara.
In one of his last letters lie gives this
homesick cry. By this time his heart was
torn two ways. He had known Plunkett
and others of the ’l6 men, and there was
doubt in him as to which was serving Ire-
land better, they or he. Poor country boy,
born for peace, and the things of peace!
I dare say you have left Meath and are back again
in the brown wides of Connaught. I would give one
hundred pounds for two days in Ireland with nothing
to do but ramble on. lam entitled to a leave now,
but I’m afraid there are many before my name on
the list. Special leaves are granted, and I have to
finish a book for the autumn. But more particularly I
want to see again my wonderful mother, and to walk
by the Boyne to Crewbawn and up through the brown
and grey rocks of Crocknaharna. You have no idea how
I suffer with this .longing for the swish of the reeds
at Slane and the voices I used to hear coming over
the low hills at Currabwee. Say a prayer that I
may get this leave and give as a condition my
punctual return and sojourn till the war is over.
He never got his special leave. He never
finished his autumn book. He was killed on
the last day of July.
Dunsany has a story of a man who longed
to come to Carcassonne. Carcassonne was
for him the city where dreams come true,
the town of over the hills and far away.
Through the story like a mournful thread
runs the negation of that longing, the doom
of all mortals: “But he—he never came to
Carcassonne.” The Carcassonne of Ledwidge
was a place of slow, still fields and lilting
lanes, and blue, far hills acroon with birds
unseen. It is one of our consolations that
he so soon has reached his Carcassonne.
EILEEN DUGGAN.
“Problem”
I would have thought that it was obvious
to anyone conversant with the cant phraseo-
logy of literary discussions that the word
“problem” used in reference to a play or
novel connotated a certain kind of social
analysis. In my sentence. “There are no
problems, there is only life,” I did not use
“problem” in its general and abstract sense,
which would have been, as “F.J.S.” so in-
telligently perceives, nonsensical (R.F.
16/4/’25). In the first place a poem is a
technical problem, and every moment, of. it.
is a problem of balance of sentence and con-
timiity of rhythm. In the second place there
is the creator’s spiritual conflict with form,
which cannot flag for a second if a true syn-
thesis of the material is to be obtained.
There is the unceasing effort to relate the
word to life, to draw in all the verbal rela-
tions of an image to the limit of concentra-
tion. Indeed, there are a thousand problems
in the execution of any work of art, from
trivial ones of grammar and syntax to the
vaster ones of the exact constructive move-
ment of emotion, and the integration of the
huddled units of experience and sensation.
The differentiation I wished to make was
not between this inextricable mass of prob-
lematic issues, this complex bridge from
subconscious to conscious, and a vacuum
labelled life. It lay, as should have been
clear from the context, between literature
that seeks a social explanation of emotion
and the direct expression of emotion where
society is only the tapestry-background for
the action of self. In order to save myself
from the accusation of gibberish from critics
such as “F.J.5.,” I will demonstrate this
variation by means of examples, just as one
uses an abacus for children learning to count,
to whom abstract numerals are only a scrawl.
Problem-literature is that which deals with
character, not from the point of view of free
existence adapting environment to itself, but
as the product of certain circumstances of
an alterable environment. Thus the litera-
ture of life does not concern itself with the
so-called economic causes of prostitution.
It does not include a Second Mrs. Tanqueray
or a Mrs. Warren’s Profession. It defines
Doll Tearsheet and Cressida, and leaves it
at that, drawing no social moral from them
or their milieu, but expressing a frank joy
in the fact that Doll and Cressida exist.
Still less does it give us a Sonia like Dos-
toieffsky’s, who is represented as much a
social product as any character in Ibsen.
The only variation is one in the degree of
depression.
As another example take the. “Jolly Beg-
gars” or the scoundrel trio in “Barnaby
Budge.” No questions are asked of this
ragamuffin company: they are sanctified by
the rapture of their conception, not by any
exposure of the fact that they arc bad citi-
zens or that malnutrition in early life was
the cause of their downfall. They exist by
right of their creators’ gusto for all that is
strongly and laughably alive. To Zola they
would be problematic specimens of mud, and
mud they would remain. To Burns and
Dickens they are ecstasy.
My “joy,” therefore, is not the abstract
combination with which “F..T.5.” seeks to
saddle me. It is not even, in the final analy-
sis. a separate emotion, but a vitalising prin-
ciple. Nietzsche’s greatest contribution to
thought lies in that he has shown how .Toy,
by willing the perpetuation of itself and of
all life, actually vitalises every condition of
emotion, even its contraries; while sorrow
seeks escape, and so death for everything.
“Macbeth” and “Lear” are joyous works be-
cause, though they are definitions of terror
and nain, they are constructed with an
ascending energy, an ecstatic acceptance of
the elements of life they might shallowly
seem to revolt from. By their insistence, on
a dominating image of powmr swelling into
larger grandeur every step, they repudiate
the humanistic problem of suffering and
sweep to a culmination of joy. This can be
seen by comparing Lear with Goriot. The
latter figure, though the work of a man of
fine genius, does not belong to the greatest
art, because its energy declines, while Lear’s
storms higher every line. This comparison
is particularly instructive because Balzac’s
book has so many great elements that it
almost approaches complete greatness,
However, “F.J.S,” has already demol-
ished this aesthetic of joy, the statement of
which is based on the analysis of the works
of Shakspeare, Rubens, Titian, Turner, Beet-
lioven, Wagner, Plato and Nietzsche, by
means of a fine sniff of superiority and a joke
about undergraduates. The argument is un-
answerable, I confess. It is no use continu-
ing against a man so equipped for dialectics,

MODERN Home-making is a pro-
fession, and no other work in
the world compares with it in import-
ance.
The Electric Range fits into the
domestic life to-day because it modern-
ises the old-fashioned yet most active
and important department of the
home —the kitchen. Its conveniences
are apparent at first glance. There is
no radiation of heat into the kitchen,
as the range itself remains cool except
for the surface units. The absence of
open flame is an insurance against acci-
dents. The thick-walled oven is most
efficient, being heavily insulated and
equipped with a damper which makes
the oven practically airtight, giving it
all the virtues of a fireless cooker,
which tends to economise and save fuel.

Commercial Lino and
CERTAIN-TEED LINO FOR CONCRETE
AND OTHER FLOORS.
Certain-teed commercial Lino is a heavy, handsome Lino,
in various thicknesses. It is silent to walk upon, and
takes a high polish. The present style of concrete floors
demands Certain-teed Lino. The floors are too raw and
hard uncovered, and the intense cold in winter makes
them impossible as business quarters without a covering.
This commercial Lino was designed to remedy these
defects. We lay and fix Certain-teed Lino on floors of
every description-— lrom one room to one thousand, and
have floored many of the largest buildings in Sydney and
Melbourne. Have your office or premises covered. It is
a good investment for health and appearance. Write
or call for prices and samples.

the ancients as an unchanging material. Here
it is combined with felt with an inner secretion
of asphalt which prevents drying out, and with
a hard rolled surface resistant to weather,
sparks, vermin and rust.
Some of the largest commercial and industrial
buildings round Sydney and Melbourne have
been roofed by us with Certain-teed with the
very best results for wear and low upkeep. We

For Ten Years -Dependable
Exceptional dependability has been a
characteristic of Dodge Brothers Motor
Car since the day the first of these sturdy
cars was marketed.
Not once in a decade has it failed to
uphold and enhance its reputation for
faithful performance.
The reason for its consistent goodness
and continued betterment points directly
back to the ideals of the founders.
Instead of fluctuating between an end-
less series of annual models, they deter-
mined to concentrate on the perfection
of a single chassis.
Dodge Brothers Motor Car to-day is the
embodiment of that ideal an ideal that
will endure as long as the institution
itself.

In the Park.
The arc-light burns beneath the tree
Like a round tropic moon of gold ;
The grass seems in its brilliancy
A silken carpet far out-rolled.
Though in the park ’tis. strangely still,
Far echoes come of noise and stress;
No warmth is here, the night is chill,
The very breeze breathes loneliness.
Here come no freighted argosies.
No laden ships with wealth untold,
For these who drift beneath the trees
Are battered hulks, out-worn and old.
The tide of life once flowing deep
Has stranded them upon the shore,
Poor derelicts who but in sleep
May sail the changeful seas once more.
One sleeper lies uneasily,
The lamp-lit grass his only bed
Mayhap the lamps of memory
Illumine golden hours long dead.
And faded splendors come again,
And fair days gone, by love made sweet,
Before in haunts of busy men
The dreamer met and knew defeat.
The city throbs without the gate
Beyond the shadow-haunted park;
But he a pawn of restless fate
Goes down through twilight to the Dark.
O sleeper on the cold, green grass,
Poor dreamer underneath the trees,
Time as his heavy footsteps pass
Mvist leave you still your memories.

Another soft grey morning shall behold
Another vessel, proudly, with sails .set.
Splitting the cloudy daylight, which hangs

They will go seeking wide seas of the mind,
Tacking into a gale that the heart feels ,

A wearv wav thus to go wandering

Never, perhaps, attaining anything
But wider wastes beyond the wide wastes
Oh, life impossible! And whither, whither

The deepest death; and I go hither and

Across my dreams and out to skies un-

And shook them from their noonday drowse,
Then, ere their ranks could rally,
It sped, exulting, on to rouse
The echoes of the valley.
Deep in some wat’ry. green retreat,
Where ferns lie hidden from the heat,
It kissed the grasses, found them sweet,
And stayed awhile to dally ;
We mounted where the timber thinned
And one old gum-tree, tempest kinned,
Of all the clouds kept tally ;
But still our thoughts were with the wind
That lingered in the valley.
VICTORIA.

THE NEW HINDENBURG LINE.
“The ‘Daily Express’ describes a demonstration in favor of Von Hindenburg’s candidature for the Presidency: Thousands of members of semi-military
and Monarchist organisations marched past with the old Monarchist banner heading each company, and every man carying a stick at the shoulder like a rifle.
Von Hindenburg, in the full uniform of a Field-Marshal, took the salute as the procession ‘goose-stepped’ past, the bands playing Deutschland Uber Alles.'"

THE STORY OF THE VOLUMNIA.
The V olumnia affair has been characterised
by John Quick, Deputy President of the
Commonwealth Arbitration Court, as “worse
than bushranging”; “a disgrace to a civil-
ised country.” This verdict will not be seri-
ously challenged when the facts are set down,
although the master of the Volumnia has
ground for Questioning whether the term
“civilised” can be properly applied to a coun-
try in which a ship hired by its National
Government, carrying coal for its Navy, and
flying the British flag, is treated by lawless
ruffians just as if it were an interned enemy
vessel, and that with impunity. The Volum-
nia was chartered by the management
of the Commonwealth Government Line
bf steamers to bring a cargo of Welsh
coal for the R.A.N., and general goods,
the latter mostly for the Christmas
trade. The owners are British; the
captain had a distinguished war record,
and the crew, or most of it, also saw war
service in the British merchant marine.
All were under the impression that they were
engaged in a lawful and peaceful business,
and that if the elements were favorable they
would arrive in Australian ports, discharge
the cargo, and leave again without molesta-
tion, being protected by the laws and having
a special arrangement with the Common-
wealth Government. Disillusionment came
when the \ olumnia reached Fremantle, its
first port.of call. There the crew was bluffed
or intimidated into joining Walsh’s Sea-
men s Union and demanding Australian rates
of pay. Not getting these rates, which are
never conceded by British and foreign com-
petitors of the Commonwealth Line (nor has
there ever been a strike against any of these
competitors on such a ground), the men re-
tused duty. As they had been quite satisfied
with the job before one of Walsh’s satel-
lites came on board, unusual efforts were
made to induce them to honor their agree-
ment with the captain. The negotiations
were protracted until they could communicate
with the secretary of their British union,
who cabled advising performance of the con-
tract. The advice being disregarded, and all
other representations failing, they were
prosecuted under the Merchant Shipping Act
and sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment.
* * » *
From October 2~> till December 24 the
V olumnia remained at Fremantle, under a
union boycott, and the assorted ruffianism of
the port did its best to make the captain’s life
a hell upon earth. In the meantime the great
Walsh arrived from Melbourne to take
charge of operations, and while the lawyers
had the floor in the Volumnia case, he inter-
fered in the wharf-laborers’ “overtime” strike
.and stage-managed a stoppage of work on the
State Government steamers and harbor craft.
The latter affair, according to the Labor Min-
ister of Works, was preceded by a proposal
that the Government should connive at
‘holding up the port of Fremantle.” in order
to get an excuse for granting deckhands £6
10s. and firemen .£7 for a 48-hour week, to-
gether with overtime at 3s. 9d. per hour and
28 days’ leave on full pay every year. On
December 24 the crew of the Volumnia was
mustered once more and ordered to take the
ship to sea, with the same result as before.
The ceremony was vainly repeated on six
subsequent days; thereupon the law was
invoked again, and the magistrate gave them
a month. Against this conviction they ap-
pealed (ample funds were placed at their
disposal, from some source or other, for legal
arguments), but McMillan, C.J., disposed
of the appeal in a few curt sentences, and
they were placed under arrest. The com-
plaisant State Labor Government rose to the
occasion and released them after a few days.
Its Criminal Investigation Department was
then instructed to arrest the captain of the
Volumnia for “wilful and wrongful” deser-
tion of the crew, a warrant having been
issued by a newly-appointed J.P., presumably
of the right color. The unfortunate skipper
had, on Feb. 19 (the boycott having lasted
just on four months, at a cost to the Com-
monwealth Government of over £lOO a day),
signed on another lot of seamen and
left Fremantle for Sydney. On arrival at
that port his troubles began anew. Not
only was the man subjected to criminal
proceedings (there were two different prosecu-
tions), but liis ship was declared “black”
by the Waterside Workers’ Federation, and,
when portion of its cargo, the first to be dis-
charged, reached another Commonwealth
Government steamer, that vessel was
cotted by members of the Ship Painters and
Dockers’ Union, while another section of
that union struck when the Volumnia was
docked. Incidentally, this is one of the group
of unions which demanded, in effect, that
the Commonwealth Government should give
them the cruiser contracts : and other mem-
bers of the group have since declared the
State-owned Walsh Island dockyard “black.”
* * * *
The “Nationalist” Government, which
chartered the boycotted vessel, has not lifted
a finger to .protect either the chief victim of
this campaign of Bolshevism or those other
victims who entrusted their goods to its
care. A Labor Ministry has openly sided
with the seamen who refused duty on a
British ship under contract to an Australian
Government. And Walsh, the chief actor
in. the sinister conspiracy, has just been ad-
mitted to . a Political Labor Conference, for
the first time, as representative of the union
which he describes as “definitely revolution-
ary”—admitted evidently as a reward for
his efforts to destroy the Australian shipping-
industry, and to do tliat of Britain all the
harm he can, if not for his envenomed hos-
tility to the White Australia policy. At
Walsh’s instance, the conference passed re-
solutions affirming that “all penalties on sea-
men. for refusing duty in Australian ports be
abolished,” and that “all persons employed
on board a ship in any Australian port”
should have the right to desert, whether for
purposes of blackmail or Bolshevism. Bishop
Burnet has a story of an aged English
advocate who, when it was remarked that
lie must have outlived all the lawyers of
his generation, replied that if Dutch Wil-
liam hadn’t come over he would have out-
lived the laws, too. Australia will suffer
that experience if its so-called “con-
stitutional” Governments make a practice of
either winking at Bolshevik lawlessness, in
the Labor fashion, or taking it lying down,
in the Nationalist way.
A CONTINENT OF MISFITS.
“Fear is brooding over Europe to-day—the fear
that war will break out again; and it is brought
home to me every day at my work that, unless that
fear can be relieved and security given, Europe is
moving uneasily and slowly, but certainly, to a new
catastrophe.” —British Foreign Secretary Chamber-
lain.
The fear that the pacification of Europe
is a botch of no small magnitude has grown
apace. It was intended that the settle-
ment should he a pious reversal of the
Treaty of Paris of a century earlier, by
which almost every little State was hitched
on to the partner it didn’t want, and the
exact opposite of the Berlin Treaty of
nearly half a century ago, which was built
somewhat on the same lines and partly on
no lines in particular. It was pre-
eminently the work of the Big Pour, and
three of them were notably unsatisfactory.
Wilson, of the United States, the most
talkative of the Four, was a self-appointed
and self-instructed ambassador from a coun-
try which had just had an election and re-
pudiated him and his party. In a high-
handed way he wished to impose forgiveness
and Christian feeling on the battered nations,
and lie carried the Sermon on the Mount
in his schoolmasterly tail-pocket. With
all his obstinacy and self-importance his
faith in the self-determination of nations
was so simple and profound that he was
almost prepared to accept Bela Kuhn, the
Bolshevik usurper sent over from Moscow,
as a genuine representative of Magyar
national sentiment. Bela, whose streak of
Mongolian blood possibly helped out his
national appearance, said he was genuine,
and Wilson hated to think that a man
would say so when he wasn’t. It is alleged
that only the strenuous protests of other
Ministers at Budapest prevented the un-
sophisticated professor whom Wilson sent
'to the scene of action from recognising
Bela, and thus adding another explosive to
the heap. Lloyd George, the next in
loquacity, was a man of strong opinions,
each lasting a day or so, and of infinite
compromise. Ilis last compromise in his
own country was to assure Northern Ireland
of its Six Counties intact, and to assure
Southern Ireland of two boroughs and much
of two counties out of the six. Then he
retired on his laurels as the genius who had
buried the Irish Question, and left the
parties to find out. He made similar com-
promises wherever they promised to oil for
the moment the hinges of the situation. It
is declared that he even put in writing a
sort of offer to recognise Bela Kuhn, the
Soviet’s viceroy at Budapest, because, until
some Government was recognised at that
city, there was no one to compromise with
in a hurry. Lloyd George was born in a
hurry and lived in one. As for Sonnino,
the colleague of these two, his outstanding
purposes were to see that the old Austrian
enemy was properly and wholly wrecked,
and to take all that could be got for Italy
from its Serbian neighbor.
* * * *
The situation, as these men made it, is
that Europe has been cut into very small
pieces. The sacred claim of races, large
and small, to self-determination and self-
government was freely admitted at the Peace
proceedings, though the chance was never
offered, even as a matter of form, to the
composite folk of Belgium and Switzerland,
the Basques of France, the Celtic Irish, the
Boers, French Canadians, Welsh and
Koreans, the job being altogether too large.
But if the liberated community is much too
small to defend itself, and especially if it
has no defensible frontiers, its very obvious
fate is to fall a prey to an unscrupulous
enemy, possibly the worst one in the neigh-
borhood, or to be a disastrous burden on
very tired friends. As friends can’t last for
ever, the impression grows that notice should
be served on some of the tiny States, such
as the group at the s.-e. corner of the
Baltic, to try if they can’t sink their differ-
ences and coalesce into an institution which
can do something for its own protection.
These little places mostly have a past and
a pedigree which are too big for them. They
have racial differences, the Lett not having
precisely the same earmark as the Esthonian
or the Finn or the Balt, and some minor
religious diversities, which are all in the
common lot. But if they can’t get over
these discrepancies it seems that their brief
sun must set for certain.. A “free city”
like Danzig, dependent entirely on the
League of Nations, which can’t depend on
itself, merely exists to make trouble. There
is only a sketchy hope that Poland and
Lithuania have come back to stay unless
they renew their ancient combination, or
that they have come back for certain even
then. The two States are almost wdiolly
Roman Catholic, are crowded in between
hostile Lutherans and hostile Orthodox
Churchmen, and, with not one strong posi-
tion of natural defence to rely on, the de-
sirability of burying the hatchet and making
a common cause seems apparent. Yet
nobody seriously expects that they will de-
velop much even in the way of formal cor-
diality. In this neighborhood four religions
—Orthodox Greek, Roman Catholic,
Lutheran and Mohammedan—once met, and
there they practised armed intolerance on a
great scale. In the days of their pride,
when their kings were hereditary and not
elective spectres, and the vast disorder of
nobles hadn’t seized on power, and the liberum
veto hadn’t come to pass, the Poles wasted
the Russian lands in a way which made the
later Downfall of Poland seem almost mild.
It was a land of pious dissension, and it
hasn’t got over its habits of long-distance
hatred to this day.
* * * *
The Peacemakers made a failure in other
and various ways. Czeclio-Slovakia was a
favored child of the moment, and had capable
and bustling diplomatists to represent it. In
the rush to subdivide the weaker enemy’s
estate, over 3,000,000 Germans and nearly
1,000,000 Magyars were handed over to
Czecho-Slovakia. It had proved itself a
gallant ally, and doubtless deserved all the
Germans and Magyars it got. Still, the
business was an outrage on the doctrine of
the self-determination of races, which doesn’t
matter much, and it planted the seeds of a
new war, which matters a great deal. Rou-
mania recovered a mass of its own separated
people at the settlement, and, it is believed,
a vast number of other people’s people. Its
census avoids giving information on the sub-
ject. The fact that Italy took high-handed
possession of a number of unwilling Slav
allies appears evident. Germany blandly
neglects to define the frontier between it and
its lost Polish province, and the League of
Nations hasn’t the semblance of an idea what
to do about it: a conviction that Berlin
should have been occupied after the war, and
retained for 20 years as security, comes
rather late. The fact that Soviet Russia in-
tends to be back at Riga and Wilna and
* ls Quite undisguised. The League
of Nations can’t even beguile it into pretend-
ing to think differently, and, in its present
form, it will apparently be quite helpless
when the Soviet begins to act as well as
think. Poland is a Roman Catholic country
with practically no frontiers and practically
no seaboard (by reason of the Danzig freak),
and it has mostly-Protestant Prussia to west
and north, while to the east lies Russia,
where the people are in the main Orthodox
Greek and the Government aims at an Estab-
lished Atheist Church. The question which
many ask, but few care to ask aloud, is
whether, m the long run, Poland will be
partitioned again (between two this time
instead of three), or whether it will be swal-
lowed whole. The Christian majority in
Constantinople got no form of self-determina-
tion. What it got was more like the off-hand
a ?d^ar rogant sack. Tile Greek population
ot the Asia Minor coast, where a Greek
population was located before Turks were
invented, got the same tiling, only in a worse
form. Attempts to do something for Chris-
tian Armenia have only resulted in one part
ot the country being a very miserable Soviet
dependency and the other part a more miser-
able Turkish province. The measure of the
.League s impotence, when up against a well-
entrenched enemy who is willing to fight
after being nominally licked the same as be-
fore. lies in the fact that it can’t even extract
a generous flow of promises of reform from
the Angora Government as it could from the
old gang at Constantinople.
* * * *
The League of Nations never had much
chance, of course. It was the city which
\\ oodkow Wilson built but his own people
lefused to inhabit it, and it filled up with
niggers. Therefore the Free City of Danzig,
which the League administers, is under the
protection of Abyssinia and Siam, as well as
other good friends. The one streak of luck
which it has had lies in the fact that the
Kilt pirates haven’t joined it; and even that
bit ot luck may not last.
A BEWILDERING ELECTION.
The indications are that ghosts will vote in
unprecedented numbers at the N. S. Wales
general election on May 30. Ghosts have
been conspicuous at recent Australian pre-
selections and by-elections, and it is notori-
ous that the unnecessary Ma State electoral
"rolls—unnecessary because the Common-
wealth rolls could have been used, with a
great saving of exertion and money—are in
that condition which ghosts love. For some
peculiar reason congestion is always a fea-
ture of the State register, as witness the
fact that it contained 144,886 more names
at the last general election on March 25,
1022, than were enrolled for the Common-
wealth election nine months later, the people
and the suffrage being the same; but it is
expected that this year’s compilation will
leave all previous congestion records panting
in the rear. When the enrolment exceeds
the adult population by 10 p.c. or more,
impersonation is as easy as falling off a log.
And if the impersonator operates in an elec-
torate with a large floating population, and
takes advantage of the absent-voting pro-
vision. which permits an elector to vote out-
side the polling-area for which he is en-
rolled without producing a photograph or a
fingerprint as evidence of bona fides, though
he mark a dozen ballot-papers the chances of
detection are small. Three years ago there
were 81,565 persons enrolled in Hyde, 79,186
in Eastern Suburbs, 76,642 in St. George,
73,981 in North Shore, 70,773 in Botany,
73,066 in Western Suburbs and 69,448 in
Balmain, all Sydney constituencies ; and they
have all increased their population since.
Obviously the polling-booth officials can know
only an infinitesimal percentage of these
multitudes, and if an impostor demands a
vote for Balmain or Botany as William
Smith, laborer, there is no means, short of
miracle or accident, of proving him an im-
postor, since evidence of identity is not
required by the Act.
* * *. #
These absurdly over-populous electorates,
which multiply the opportunities of Tam-
many crooks, are among the “blessings” con-
ferred on N. S. Wales by proportional repre-
sentation. Other blessings are sectarian
members, minority rule (no party has had a
majority since_ the system arrived) and a
method of filling casual vacancies which
admits of a member presenting or selling
his seat to a defeated candidate without the
constituency being consulted, and even of a
person who never stood for election being
given an Assembly seat on the nomination
of a party leader, as happened four years
ago in Goulburn. There has been a lot of
talk at various times about trying other
ways of solving the unsolvable, but nothing
has been done. The position is that if a
Nationalist, Cocky or Labor member drops
out he may be succeeded by the defeated can-
didate of the same party who polled the high-
est number of No. 1 votes, but Heaven only
knows what will happen if an Independent
dies or resigns (there were two in the last
Assembly, and a swarm is standing this
time), for no provision has been made for
such cases.
* « *• *
Complications may also arise as regards
the transfer value of preference votes. The
election of the third member for Wammerawa
was upset in 1922 as the result of a dispute
on this head, the Elections and Qualifica-
tions Committee deciding that the method
of computation used by the returoing-officer
in accordance with departmental instructions
(it was employed in all the electorates) and
certified as correct by local authorities on
the system, was wrong. This decision not
only deprived a strong minority of the repre-
sentation to which the Electoral Department
said it was entitled, but gave two of the
three seats to a party which got less
than half of the No. 1 votes—
-12,485 out of 26,280. The point at issue
in W ammerawa was whether exhausted
votes, of which there were 39,000 through-
out the State, should have been subtracted
from available preferences (as was done by
the returning-offieer) in calculating the
transfer value of those preferences, the trans-
fer value being ascertained by division of
the second member’s surplus. Presumably
the method declared to be right by the Elec-
tions and Qualifications Committee and
wrong by the Electoral Department will be
followed on May 30, but the question has
not been settled by legislation, and it will
in all probability be raised again, perhaps
before an Elections and Qualifications Com-
mittee with a changed personnel, wherever
Wammerawa conditions are repeated. In
which event the head of the Electoral De-
partment, who insisted that his wav Vas
correct even after the Elections and Quali-
fications Committee had pronounced it in-
correct, will very likely be called as a wit-
ness by the appellant or appellants.
What with contortional misrepresentation,
overloaded rolls, unwieldy electorates in
which impersonation may be practised with
impunity, the ill-feeling caused by the Ne
Tcmere measure—which will have political
consequences undreamt of by its authors —
the, hostility of the true-blue Cockies to
Weakne and Chaffey. the bitterness be-
tween the A.W.U. and the A.L.P. executive,

“A STINCKYNGE YDOL RATHER.”
The Romans derived May Day from Maius
and MAIA, two deities of ancient Latmim and
the mysterious and murky rites of Bona Dea
were celebrated then. But the festival goes
back to more remote antiquity. Primitne
man celebrated it as the emblem of the
resurrection of Nature, of the bpring up
rising of the earth from the death-like sleep
of Winter. With simple logic they argued
that this magical awakening, so vital to then
existence, could not happen without human
interposition; and each year they Teproduced
the miracle with savage rites, lens ot tho
sands of human beings must have been sacii-
ficed to the conception of the earth-mothei
need of rejuvenating blood. Colossal images
of wickerwork were filled by the Butish
Druids with live men, cattle and animals of
all kinds and set fire to, so that the eaith
might be resuscitated with their essence.
It was the custom until recent times hi
certain parts of Europe for the farmer and
his wife to go out on May night into the
fields and lie together so that the crops might
benefit by sympathetic magic. lhc same
notion led, on this ancient anmversaiy, to
scenes of wild debauchery amongst men and
women, boys and girls, whose motive was the
fertilising of the crops. The Maypole ol
Germany and England was originally *
phallic emblem, and the dances round it
were a ritual aimed at stimulating growth.
In his “Anatomie of Abuses, first pub-
lished in London in 1583, Phiup
thus describes how the Maypole was brought
in in the days of good Queen Bess
Against May, Whitsonday or other time, all
the young men and maides, olde men and wives,
run gadding over-night to the woods, grov s,
hils and mountains, where they spend all the
night in plesant Pastimes; and in the morning they
return, bringing with them birch and branches
trees, to deck their assemblies withalh
And no Mervaile, for there is a Great Lord pie-
sent amongst them, as Superintendent and Lord ovei
their pastimes and Sports, namely, Sathan, piince
of hel. But the chiefest Jewel they bung ti om
thence is their May-pole, which they bring home
with great veneration as thus. They have twentie
or tortie yoke of oxen, every oxe having a sweet nose-
gay of tlouers placed on the tip of his hornes, and
these oxen drawe home this May-pole (this stmck
vnge Ydol rather), which is covered all over with
ilouers and hearbs, bound round about with strings
and sometime painted with variable colors, with tv, o
or three hundred men, women and children follow-
ing it with great Devotion. And thus beeing reared
u” they straw the ground rounde about binde

‘Though May Day in Europe no longer
directly celebrates the coming of the bpring,
something of its savage origin seems to
tinge the emotions of the celebrants., bmce
it was naturally chosen as the anniversary
of the uprising of the proletariat, it has be-
come a sort of constantly recurring and
inevitable St. Bartholomew’s Eve. Weeks
before its advent the sinister rumor ot it
grows. Newspapers begin a wordy warfare,
rising rapidly in temper. A battle of rival
propagandists breaks out. Socialist posters
proclaim “La Greve,” “II sciopero ; Gov-
ernment placards obliterate them witli
appeals to the people to remain at work, lfie
workers insist on terming the day a holiday;
the police persist in regarding the celebrants
as strikers. On May Day morning tlie cities
are in a state almost of siege. Soldiers are
quartered and machine-guns concealed m
public buildings. Ambulances and military
dressing-stations are in readiness for casual-
ties, and armored cars full of gendarmes and
soldiery thunder along the boulevards.
In Paris the crowds move towards tlie
Place de la Republique. Men sell little
sprigs of geranium as a symbol of the revo-
lution, while others sell white lilies-of-the-
valley as a token of the counter-revolution.
The cafes are closed, and the crowd without
them is ripe for any mischief. Hotels are
bolted and barred, and tickets are required
to gain admission. Somebody gets up and
harangues the crowd, and a solid phalanx
of gendarmes moves towards him, clearing
a path for themselves with the flats of their
swords. The crowd thickens, gets uglier m
tone. A few tear up the iron grids from
around the trees that line the boulevard.
Here and there a policeman is struck or
stabbed: from a side street a shot rings out.
A couple of armored cars come careering
through the crowd, smashing its massed
formation. All the time rumors are flying
along the streets of Government shootings
in Rome, of riots in Barcelona, of revolution
somewhere else. The air is full of a fierce
unrest, a contagious savagery; and faces
wear an expression of expectancy or fearful
doubt.
Next day the citizens take stock m the
press of the divided honors of the day. A
dozen deaths, a few hundred casualties
amongst civilians, a score of policemen more
or less badly injured. From every capital of
Europe come similar reports, the same m
kind if different in degree; but every city
is glad, for it feels as if it had passed safely
through the chance and peril of a revolution.
In Paris in 1919 there were machine-guns
in the streets and 500 May Day casiialties.
There is a tendency for the infection to
spread. America has made a start with riots
and repressions. And the Communists of
Britain tried last year to sweeten the holiday
with a little bloodshed.
This is the “stinckynge ydol” the imported
leaders of the Australian Labor movement
wish to introduce into this _ country. The
Australian working-man is invited to turn
his infatuated visage away from the country
which gave him the advantages he enjoys and
towards the Old World where these advan-
tages are still to seek. The Eight-hour Day,
the imported leaders complain, is “a great
festival of the obsolete and is developing
into a farce." There is never any shooting
in it, for instance.
M. G. S.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Bolsheviks and Bulgarians.
That familiar acquaintance, the Crime
Wave, has been breaking on the shore
heavily of late. One place where it washed
in was Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. What-
ever its drawbacks may be, Bulgaria is a
State which has something to recommend it
in the view of Labor orators and others. It
has no nobility and no Upper House. The
single Chamber is elected by manhood suf-
frage, the members are paid, and any citi-
zen aged over 30 who is not a parson, a
criminal or a soldier aw'ay at a war may
be a member. At the last election the
Communists returned 99 members in a House
of 356. It is probable that this will be
radically altered in future. The other day
a bomb was inserted in the beautiful cathe-
dral of Sofia when the funeral service of an
important personage had attracted a crowd,
and 13 generals, eight colonels, three mem-
bers of Parliament and nearly 200 other
people went to glory on the spot. The
injured numbered 1300 or so, and the build-
ing was reduced to tatters. By a miscalcu-
lation the combustible went off at one end of
the place while most of the notables d'ere
gathered roijjnd the coffin at the other, otper-
wise Bulgaria might have had no Govern-
ment and very few notables left. Four
hundred Communists were promptly arrested,
and as many more as can be found
will be collected in time. Melbourne has
had two explosions in quick succession, but
no chance has yet presented itself of blowing
up a mass of leading Australians at once, in
a confined space where the force of the explo-
sion wouldn’t be wasted and dissipated, and
where there were massive domes to fall on
the audience. Still the event will probably
come, unless the law takes the initiative by
deporting the mass of non-Australian leaders
and teachers of the cult, for the doings at
Sofia may be an inspiration, and there is
always the chance of better luck next time.
The cogent reason for ascribing many big
crimes and many small ones to the Com-
munists is that they are the only people who
lay it down that no Government, republican
or monarchical, popular or unpopular, should
be tolerated unless it is their Government.
They assert with no disguise that they should
get into power and stay in power whether
the people want them or not, that any means
are justifiable for getting in and staying in,
and that no majority, however large, should
count against them, provided they can find
a means to keep it down. As a means to
this end it is difficult to imagine anything
more favorable than the dropping of a cathe-
dral or a Parliament House on all the leaders
of the “bourgeois” parties at once, on the very
rare occasion when these leaders can be got
together in one spot. Large, persistent and
apparently purposeless strikes, of the kind
with which Australia is so much affected, re-
present piecemeal attacks on the scheme of
civilisation, pending the time when the general
attack will be ready. The idea of a coming time
when all the “bourgeoisie” may be assaulted
and robbed at once, and the deed done with
public commendation and as a matter of
principle, instead of odd specimens being mal-
treated surreptitiously and with some ele-
ment of risk, is so attractive that the bulk
of aggressive criminals and incipient crimi-
nals can’t be other than Communists. The
rare exception is the Bill Sikes who realises
that he lives on the “bourgeoisie,” and that
it would be folly to destroy his only asset
in one orgy. The absurdity of permitting
known and identifiable Communists to vote
for anything or to sit in any governing body
is as evident as that of permitting habitual
strikers and strike-makers to take arbitration
as a side-line, and those who invariably tear
up awards to apply for and obtain more
awards. Seeing that revolution is the Com-
munist’s weapon he should be told to stick
to it, like the cobbler to his last. It some-
times happens, by good luck, that they who
take the sword perish with the sword; but
it is best not to let them have the gun also,
lest the perish should be a failure. _ The
progress of Communism in Australia is un-
certain, for any person may believe and
preach the obscene faith and be a member
of the Labor party at the same time, _ so
long as he denies the name of Communist.
Manv other matters are uncertain, includ-
ing the identity of the persons who run the
country now. The police don t seem to
count for much. They are few and
wretchedly paid, and the price of biting a
constable has gone down almost to nothing.
The militarv forces have practically died
out. The High and Supreme Courts only
appear to count when no organised strike-
making institution says they mustn’t. The
Government seems to matter little, and the
big. well-tailored young man at the head of
it has apparently ceased to matter at all.

The Province of Pearce.
Pearce’s Northern Province dream gets
more like a nightmare as details of it are
sketched into the picture. For example, he
includes Normanton in his string of natural
deep-water outlets” to which railways might
be built. Taking the Sailing Directions
issued by the Marine Board of Queensland
as being some authority on the matter, the
pilgrim making for Normanton, having
reached Karumba, at the mouth of the river,
would proceed in a craft drawing not more
than Bft. to go up at low water. This would
convey him —bar accidents —to Double
Island, which is 38 miles from where lie
started. Here he would have to lighten the
craft to sft., when she could proceed an-
other seven miles to Baffle Group. The “direc-
tions” remark sadly:—
The township is 10 miles up the river [from the
group of Baffle] beyond the sandbanks, and six miles
by land : but the navigation, at high water even, is
far too intricate and dangerous for any vessels but
those of very light draft of water, as ledges of rock
cross the river in several places. No vessel should
attempt to proceed beyond Baffle Group drawing More
than six feet, and then only at spring .tides.
The pilgrim arriving at neap tides would
find too much water for walking and too
little for swimming, so that apparently he
would be reduced to the necessity of float-
ing the last section on his stomach. Seaward
of Karumba the Admiralty Sailing Direc-
tions take up the tale: —
The approach [to Karumba] is fronted by sand-
banks which extend over 41 miles seaward, and the
depth is less than three fathoms [lB feet] at low
water for a distance of 10 miles off.
Out beyond that again the water deepens
slowly, and with the steep sea which gets up
anywhere near the head of the gulf 'wh en
there is a bit of a blow on, a ship drawing
24ft. would not feel safe any closer m than
12 or 15 miles, or just on 70 miles from
the seaport town that Pearce has dis-
covered. It is time his friends awakened him
from his trance, if only to introduce him to
a chart —or even a schbol atlas.
♦-
Westralia and Tasmania.
Westralian politicians have got into the
way of linking their case with that of las-
mania, which has been a real and severe
sufferer through Federation. The other clay
Minister Troy called in at Hobart to enlist
local aid, and did it in this wise:—
There is a bond between Tasmania and Westralia.
.... We are exploited by the Eastern States, particu-
larly by Victoria and N.5.W.... .Any attempt to
establish secondary industries is destroyed by the
competition of the old-established firms of the Eastern
States We are in the same position m relation
to Victoria and N.S.W. as these States were in
relation to the outside world before federation.
They were then exploited by outside competition,
and now we are exploited by them.
As for the impossibility of establishing new
secondary industries in downtrodden Groper-
land, the real position is that the big State
established some neiv factories every year
from 1017 to 1923 (the 1924 figures are not
in yet), and only Victoria and N.S.W. have
had as good results: —
Westralia’s New Factories and Factory Workers.
New New Factory
Factories. Workers.
1918- .. .. 5 7(9
1919- .. .. 58 2492
1920- .. .. 78 162.)
1921- .. .. 91 1033
1922- .. .. 213 970
Even S. Australia, with its old-established
industries, didn't make so good a pace in
some years, while Queensland and Tasmania
were nowhere in the race, though the Golden
State is willing to accept alms from both
of them. Further, in three years out of
the five the Westralian lias contrived to be
the best-paid of all Australian factory-
workers. In all five years he has been
paid above the average. And in every
year of the five (see page 897 of the
“Official Year Book,” 1924) he has been,
measured by value of output per worker, the
poorest factory “hand” of the lot. TV hetlicr
this has been by reason of incompetence,
mixed drinks or a Bolshevik habit of mind
which makes him rebel against honest toil
the chronicle sayeth not. But it explains
why his luck hasn’t been better, and makes
one marvel that it has been so good.

Base Uses.
Sydney Labor Daily has discovered a con-
spiracy of Father Bull’s. The Singapore
Base, it finds, is not to be built for the ex-
clusive purpose of saving the Australian
working-man from the consequences of his own
folly in neglecting the art of self-defence, but
for the general purpose of protecting the
sea-borne commerce and trade interest of
Britain in Asia as well. This has been quite
obvious to ordinary selfish people from the
first. Britain’s important trade with China
passes through the Malacca Straits into the
China Sea, where it must thread its way
through narrow seas that swarm with har-
bors in the hands of feeble native Govern-
ments and absentee white overlords, and the
facilities afforded to any hostile nation for
establishing submarine bases in the welter
of unattached islands are unbounded. A
small fleet of light cruisers quartered on
Hongkong are the sole watchdogs of this
enormous arf a; and in the event of an enemy
fleet of larger kidney putting in an appear-
ance they would be rendered quite innocuous.
If Father Bull is ever threatened in these
waters it is obvious, therefore, that he must
produce from his sleeve or elsewhere an
array of battleships sufficient to deal with
any menace. The only sleeve that is handy
and commodious enough to fit the bill as far
as the China Sea is concerned is Singapore.
The Labor Daily, repelled by the selfish-
ness of Father John, proposes to build a
base at Darwin. As it doesn’t go into the
question of the value or uses of its base, it
may be worth while considering the
advantages of its prot6g6 from a strategic
point of view. As a protector of Australian
commerce it looks groggy and far away. The
main routes taken by Australian wool, wheat,
metals and meat on their long journey to
Britain are via the Cape and Suez. The
Cape route is as remote from Darwin for all
military purposes as Auckland Island. The
Suez route which goes by Fremantle and
Colombo is nearer, but it is not as close to
Darwin as it is to Singapore, and it is only
900 miles from Java, which is only a day’s
sail from Singapore, and in the hands of a
hostile Power could be made into an impreg-
nable rallying-point against Australian trade.
Father Bull knows on which side his bread
is buttered and where the sides and middle
of the sandwich come from, and that is one
reason why he proposes to settle his base at
Singapore. It is true that the Singapore
Base w-ould not be of much use in protecting
the Pacific from commerce raiders; but
neither would a base at Darwin. The Aus-
tralian squadron would have to deal with
them. Perhaps, however, it is unfair to the
Labor Daily to criticise its Darwin base
on strategic grounds. It doesn’t propose to
build any ships of war to live in its base
or promote an Australian army to defend it;
it only desires to build it. Or it may be that
it merely wants to create a diversion so that
nothing may be built at all.

Woman.
A Family Doctor has something to say
about her; —
She is getting a lot of attention lately; but, apart
from the doctors, it is chiefly from women who
cannot claim to speak on behalf of 1 per cent, of
their sisters.
I often wonder what the ordinary woman in the
house thinks of all these proposals for care during
pregnancy. Pregnancy, if the reformers have their
way, is to become a sort, of notifiable disease, like
small pox, and the afflicted are to be taken charge
of and advised, examined, reported on and Heaven
knows what. Pre-natal care sounds well, and if it
could be systematised possibly some improvement
in maternal morbidity statistics might be looked
for; but how many women of normal temperament
will submit to be examined periodically, inside and
out, measured, overhauled and even drugged by their
own family doctor, much less in a semi-public clinic?
Seeing that the death-rate amongst parturient women
is about one in two hundred and fifty, and that many
of those who do succumb should never have con-
ceived, for reasons quite unconnected with child-
bearing, the average woman, 1 believe, would rather
take the risk. The poor who have to lean on t.lio-
hospitals for care during maternity, and the rich
who engage a 50-guinea consultant in the first place,
may tolerate this inquisition; but a fairly long medi-
cal experience here and elsewhere leads me to suspect
that the in-between class will not.
The average normal-minded woman will submit to
much during labor, and even a black man with a
cbloroforin-bottle might not inconceivably be a wel-
come visitor; but while she is well and merely
exercising what she considers her normal function
in life, the attentions even of a doctor are liable
to be considered an intrusion. I know in my own
practice it is not always easy to get even the cus-
tomary specimens for analysis; and if a routine
and periodical examination were asked for, my
patients would, 1 suspect, think T was unduly fussy
or endeavoring to make an extra fee, with the result
that a proportion of my obstetric practice would
move down the . road.
Before pre-natal clinics are a success women will
have to be educated in that sense. It will take a
generation to get them used to the idea; and then
we will have to start on the husbands. How many
men endowed with tlie normal male sense of pro-
prietorship in their womenfolk will acquiesce in the
periodical yarding-up and examination of their wives
by strange doctors, or even maybe by medical
students? I wouldn’t, for one, though my trade is
medicine. Dr. Moleswouth, of Sydney, for whom
1 have the highest respect, would have a blood exami-
nation, too: and even the most unsophisticated in
these days knows what that is for, and is liable to
take such a suggestion as a gratuitous insult.
Most of the advocates of systematised pre-natal
care are among the ranks of the consultants, and
such are often in a position to dictate the terms on
which they will care for a given case. The general
practitioner, ordinarily speaking, is not.

Hintlenburg.
II INDBNBUKG, who lias gained the billet of
President of Germany, kept clear of public
meetings, but stated bis views to the press.
He demands that Germany shall get back its
entire former prestige, and its “place in
the sun.” He refuses to accept the new
Polish frontier, and has no use for Poland.
He further requires that Germany shall be
acquitted of the charge of having caused tin-
war; and if that is done the Allies will, of
course, have no decent excuse for refusing
to return the Hun's lost colonies and to
write off the indemnity. Being asked whether
he was in favor of the restoration of the
monarchy, or wanted the republic to last,
the grim old battler refused to say anything
in favor of the republic. But he proceeded
to review “many thousands of members of
semi-military and monarchist organisations.”
They carried monarchist banners, and their
stride was wholly military, though they wore
no uniforms, and had left their guns at home
under the bed. The old gentleman himself
was in full uniform, and the bands played
“Deutschland Über Alles.” This was at
Hanover —Berlin or Hamburg would, no
doubt, have furnished a bigger show. A
Supreme Hun Court has just finished a
formal inquiry into the doings of the _ ex-
Crown Prince during the war, and has given
him a certificate which qualifies him to ascend
the throne at any hour of the day or night.
Whatever outrages, plunderings, burnings
and executions were done by his army, in-
cluding tlie executions carried out in public
by command of military tribunals, the pure
but absent-minded commander knew nothing
about them. Taking one thing with another
Australia had better not hope for many more
instalments of that indemnity.

Rose Scott, whose gentle spirit has gone
aloft, won the fight for womanhood suffrage
in N. S. Wales when the militants might
have retarded its coming for years. That
section in the Womanhood Suffrage League
tried to depose her from the presi-
dency after asserting % tliat her methods
were “too ladylike”; and there was a
meeting at which hatpins were used and
a parasol was broken over the head of an
unfortunate male member who espoused the
peaceful-propaganda cause. But Miss Scott
prevailed. Presently W. J. Lyne became
leader of the Protectionist Opposition, and
Miss Scott extracted a promise from him
that he would introduce a Suffrage Bill
whenever it lay in his power. Then Lyne
came to terms with Labor, whose support as
a third party had kept G. H. Reid in offipe.
Came a motion of censure regarding an un-
sanctioned payment of £3OO to J. C. Neild,
M.L.A. for Paddington and afterwards
Senator, for expenses incurred when he made
inquiries in Europe concerning old-age pen-
sions—that was one of the devices by which
Reid shelved the question—and the solid
Labor vote was transferred to the Opposi-
tion. So the Reid Government fell, and
Lyne faithfullv redeemed his promise to
Miss Scott. “Oom Bill’s” word in these
matters was always as good as his bond.

natioiml discourtesy of saying so. Even the
Admiralty in its confidential instructions to
the fleet imagined the North Sea chart
as being turned ujlside down, so that infer-
ences could not be drawn. The latest U.S.
message expresses official anxiety as to the
eilect which their “friendly enthusiasm” may
have in Australia. East October Australia
should have disclaimed all knowledge of the
proposed junction of the Australian and U.S
fleets after “the defeat of Japan.” Failing
this disclaimer, the Japanese are quite en-
titled to assume that Australia is actually
a party to these manoeuvres, and if trouble
ever takes place Japan won’t be slow to re-
mind the League of Nations of the facts. An-
other American editor thinks that “timid
souls fear that Australia may display too
rrmch anti-Japanese feeling on the arrival of
the [American], fleet” in Australian waters.

men in this country will do anything except

lesson in international manners.

AY iien the United States made its first immi-
gration quota law it enacted that to the
number of aliens of any white race which
were inside the republic at the census of
1,)20 might be added by importation 3 per
cent, annually. (The quota system doesn’t
apply to Canadians by birth, partly because
the long frontier is difficult to guard, and
partly because the place is more or less a
Yankee possession.) Under this original
policy the biggest permissible influx was of
Germans, with Italians almost level; then
Russians, Poles, Irish, English and Aus-
trians in that order. It very soon occurred
to Uncle that, though the number of arrivals
was reduced, he was getting too many of the
wrong sort. So the percentage was cut
down, and the census of 1890 (30 years
further back) was taken as the basis. In
1890 the foreign colony was made of very
different materials, and quite unlike the
affair of 1920. Now Germans can send
across the biggest mob, then the Irish and
next the English. The little Irish Free State
can send as many as Russia, Austria, Poland,
Bohemia (Czeclio-Slovakia since the war),
Italy, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, Portugal,
Spain, Belgium, Mexico and the whole mob
of Central and South America Republics
combined; and Scotland may be thrown in
as a make-weight. Germany, at last advices,
wasn’t sending half its quota across the
Atlantic, for Fritz Hun is exceedingly busy
at home; but Celtic Ireland is straining its
allowance to the utmost, and it looks as if
it was being permitted to overdraw the
account. Departures for the U.S., Canada
and Newfoundland are said to have averaged
4000 per week for part of last winter. It
suggests that depopulation has resumed.
Meanwhile the Mediterranean and East and
Central European surplus, including surplus
Bolsheviks, is banking up. to say nothing of
the Japanese surplus. The situation is full
of interest, and it will be fuller if the un-
stable Yank takes another sudden thought
and makes the census of 1870 the basis of
his calculations.

When famine was bad in the south of
Russia three or four years ago, British
Labor-member Lansbury hurried across and
ascertained at a glance that the disaster Avas
due to the wickedness of Britain in making
war on the Soviet country. Some allied
troops certainly occupied some towns in the
far north of Russia and the far east of
Siberia in 1918, but that doesn’t appear very
relevant. Now a new famine of a terrible
character is reported from the same region.
It was foreshadowed last year, when Ramsay
Macdonald was ruling beneficently in Eng-
land, and it has arrived. Thus even
the friendly recognition of most of the States
that matter, and especially of Britain, appears
of no avail. The position is that Russia,
Avhich once had grain to sell to a great part
of the world, now buys food abroad when
it can be bought, and when it can’t be bought
Russia starves. In 1922, the year after
Lenin promised to again permit private trad-
ing and private enterprise, the country cer-
tainly exported 7700 tons of food, but it
contrived to import 978.955 tons, so there
was Aictual in the land. Then witli the pass-
•mg of Lenin and Trotsky inferior cranks
got hold, and resumed some of the old ways
and the consequence to the country’s food-
buying capacity has been bad. Ivan AViieat-
ski lost his interest in business when lie was
ordered to hand oath- all produce, save what
was required by his family, as a rent or tax
or free contribution to the State, and he re-
soßed that it wasn’t worth while having a

fiscation, and was taking too many risks
The output of mines and factories fell off
under the Bolshevik regime, too, but not
nearly so much ; methods of vigorous super-
vision could be employed to men who worked
in crowds. But Han AVheatski, plodding
his disheartened way on a million farms, is
a good deal of a law to himself.
G. D. Meudell’s loud hosanna:—
Latelj there has been an irritating flux of sermons
by globe-trotters, Governors, Rotary Clubs, and other
such people upon the text that Australia must work
harder, or progress faster, or else something dire and
calamitous and altogether unpleasant will happen to
us and our highly-blest country. Personally I can’t
see any cause to growl at this country or its
people. Chas. H. Wickens, Commonwealth Statis-
tician, lately completed an excellent inventory of
the wealth of Australia, tabulated first of all by

“A lath-bun. for my Little Pet!”
otner silly indictment is that we ought not to manu-
factuie for ourselves, but should expand Our primary
or raw-material producing industries and import
what we eat, wear and drink. In million pounds
hei e is an unequalled record of factory output made
by all Australia: 1919, £249; 1920,' £292; 1921,
*£324 ; 1922, £320 ; and 1922-23, £326. This is
the record of 5,688,092 people (half females) of
whom 36.15 were under 15 and over 65 years of age.
What have our traducers got to say to that? If
it were an ordinary record of work one wouldn’t
mind the sneers, criticism or advice. Being a story
of hard work, clean living, and honest effort un-
equalled by any other people anywhere at any
time, during this civilsation anyhow, one fiercely
resents this national calumny.
“Feng-Shtji” : No more amazing shift of
fortune could be imagined than the elevation
of Kabakiian, Soviet ambassador to China,
be dean of the diplomatic corps in Pekin.
A few months ago Kabakiian was a red rag
to the Legation bull. When China endorsed
Ins. appointment, the old Czarist represen-
tative had to be turned out by force, and
Kakakhan moved in with a guard of
Chinese and Red soldiery. In times of trouble
calling for united action by the foreign
I owers, the doyen of the diplomatic corps
and the senior admiral in Chinese waters
have great powers. For that reason every
country tries to send its most venerable relic
to fill the position of diplomat. Kabakiian
is quite frank about his intentions, and de-
clarecl in an interview that when he becomes
doyen of the corps, no proposals of an “Im-
perialistic” nature will be presented to the
Chinese Government. Meanwhile his own
Government is busy stamping out all vestige
of Chinese control for GO miles on both sides
of the Manchurian railway. This railway
was one of the articles of Czarist loot which
the Soviet grandiloquently announced would
he handed over to its rightful owners. The
Soviet didn’t happen to hold it at the time,
however.

“Hasen” : Radio broadcasting seems in
danger of drifting into a dreary backwater
and staying there. Present programmes,
apart from time-signals, news-readings and
bed-time stories, consist mostly of a stodgy
diet of studio-concerts, never very bright,
scratch orchestras and interminable talks,
the subjects of these last having been chosen
apparently with skill and care to ensure the
least interest to the most people. Even
gramophone records have been used to fill in,
< arttso and Gaeli-Cubci being featured by
this sort of second-hand proxy, and, in the
case of the latter, moving a suspicious writer
to pen dark innuendoes about cheap advertis-
lng. Perhaps the hardest-working, most
patriotic and least imaginative advertising
of the sort that I have heard was in the
announcements of an American station in
Manila which invariably declared proudly
y before each atrocious item, “Station
K/iKA speaking, situated in the island of
Luzon, at Manila, the Pearl of the Orient.”
(Urcscendo ct cmphatico.) I’m still expect-
ing to hear local studios end their announce-
ments with, “....situated at Melbourne, the
.Jueen City of the South.” Otherwise the
resemblance to that tedious Philippine station
is already rather marked.
“Northerner” : Now that population is de-
finitely moving north in Queensland, atten-
tion ought to be given to the shocking pre-
valence of \ .1). The chief propagators are
the blacks. Every camp possesses infected
natives, male and female, who intermix with
re f’ t ’ a, ) fl n °t only among their own
’ °F’ but also with white prospectors and
employees of the cattle-stations: The onus
is on the Governments concerned. In Queens
land it is one of the duties of the police to
apprehend syphihtic niggers, and take them
to a proper place for treatment. In the
extreme outside districts, where V.D. is most
common, the police officers, usually a ser-
geant and two constables to a district, have
several hundred miles of difficult country to
patrol, and many duties are loaded upon
them, so it is impossible for the present staff
to effectively prevent the spread of the dis-
ease. It will be only by medical examination
of all aborigines, especially those camped on
cattle-stations and about diggings, and by
every native found to be infected being taken
to a hospital or other suitable place for treat-
ment, that this menace to northern settle-
ment will be seriously reduced.
♦
“Buttenderry” : Given the possibility of
irrigation, aridity isn’t a curse. Professor
Hilgarb, recognised some years ago as the
foremost soil expert in the U.S.A., declared
that “arid countries are always rich coun-
tries when irrigated,” and affirmed that
the amazing fertility of the Nile country
was due not to the annual sedimentary de-
posit, which is only l-25th of an inch thick,
but to a “quality inherent in aridity itself.”
In proof he pointed out that “the neighbor-
ing province of Fayoum, in the Libyan
Desert, shares the fertility of the -Nile dis-
trict, though irrigated only with the clean
waters of Lake Niveris.” The superiority
of arid soils over those in human regions is
easily explained. Plant food is continually
being formed in the soil by “weathering,”
which is a combination of chemical action
in the soil itself and atmospheric action.
Some of these foods, such as potash, lime,
magnesia and sulphuric and phosphoric acids,
are readily soluble in water, and, in districts
where the rainfall is large, quantities of
these valuable ingredients are taken into
solution and carried away. In .arid regions,
on the other hand, since they are not being
dissipated by rain, and their formation is a
constant process, they accumulate. Over
1000 analyses of soils in East and West
America showed that those of the arid re-
gions, as compared with those of the humid
regions, contain three times as much potash,
six times as much magnesia and fourteen
times as much lime. William E. Smytiie.
in his “Conquest of Arid America,” points
out that the national population grew from
less than four millions in 1790 to more than
sixty-two millions in 1890, and attributes
that great performance to the “continental
expanse of marvellous resources awaiting the
labor and genius of man.” He then asks:
“Can there be any question that the abound-
ing prosperity of the American people during
the first century, of their national life was
due to this luminous fact? Can there be
any reasonable doubt that if the policy of
national conquest over new areas can find
another field on which to operate, and
if it be entered upon with the old vigor and
faith, it will confer another century of pros-
perity upon the nation so fortunately en-
dowed?” These are questions that all Aus-
tralians, especially members of the Federal
Parliament, might ask themselves fre-
quently, since, so far as I know, theirs is the
only country “so fortunately endowed.”
*
“Chhota Peg” : In dealing with the present
system of compulsory military training
“Windsor” says (B. 16/4/’25) “it is
steadily cooling the ardor of those who are
willing and eager to be instructed.” They
are not the only ones whose ardor is being
cooled. The instructors themselves in many
cases are suffering. A man who has worked
through four years at Duntroon and gradu-
ated full of a desire to make his unit the best
in the brigade finds he is almost alone in his
ambition. Some of the senior officers and
occasionally one or two of the juniors have
the same spirit, but the prevailing idea is
that things might as well go on as they have
gone and that it is not worth trying to
improve them. The reason is largely that
trainees are not with the regiment long
enough to absorb the esprit de corps in which
so much faith is placed by military authori-
ties in other parts of the world. Both they
and the officers realise that their training
is a mere interruption, and that it is hardly
worth while trying to do more than the
necessary work laid down in the syllabus.
The boys are anxious to get the business over
as quickly as possible and have no hesitation
in letting their lack of interest be noticed;
consequently the officers and instructors,
after trying for a few days to make the work
interesting and promote keenness, give up
the struggle and fall in with the general
desire for a rush through the parades and an
early dismissal. In any case, there is insuf-
ficient control, by which I mean insufficient
authority for maintaining control. The 0.0.
can fine, certainly, but only up to the amount
earned by attendance on parade; and this is
so small that the deprivation of it is not
really a deterrent. Therefore there is nothing
but the fear of being sent to a detention camp
for a fortnight 'to. prevent any trainee so
minded from consistently misbehaving on
parade and hindering the work of the bat-
talion. And before such detention can be
ordered proceedings must be taken in a civil
court. Is it any wonder that both officers
and other ranks” lose interest?

POLITICAL
POINTS
In the fight between Fuller, of Wollondilly
(N.S.W.), and Lang, the Parramatta Pet.
Fuller won the first round by pointing out
that his Government had reduced railway
freights and fares, whereas the Labor Trea-
surer had raised them 16 2-5 p.c., and that
he had remitted taxation to the extent of
£530,000 p.a., whereas Lang had demanded
another £2,000,000 in his first year, and
was about to extract an additional £2,000,000
when the electors heaved him out. Fuller
finished the round by undertaking to remit
a further £500,000 p.a. Lang is receiving
the attentions of his seconds.
N.S.W. Premier Fuller’s idea of “refornv
ing” the Leg. Council, now composed of 75
nominee members appointed for life, is to
“restrict the membership to a fixed and rea-
sonable number,” and “limit the tenure to
a neriod of years.” Also, in his own words;
The council shall not be abolished until the
electors consent to such a course after being con-
sulted by a referendum on a definite proposal to
that effect.
The “shall” notwithstanding, there is no-
thing in Fuller’s proposals to prevent his
“reformed” Chamber being voted out of exist-
ence, as was the one in Queensland, by a
Labor majority nominated for that purpose.
And the Queensland deed was done in de-
fiance of a massive pro-Council majority at
a referendum. Nor did that majority express
any resentment at the succeeding election.
A second Chamber elected as the Senate is
would assuredly endure. So, probably, would
a household-suffrage body. But no amount
ot patching will save the nominee craft from
shipwreck.
The N. S. Wales Fuller Government, which
is to face the electors next month, will pre-
sently be two Ministers short, Charlie Oakes,
“Colonial” Secretax-y and M.L.A. for Eastern
Suburbs, having decided that his health is
“not equal to the strain of another election,”
although his seat looked pretty safe. When
Cocks left the Treasury for the London
Agency, Fuller appointed himself to_ the
vacancy instead of elevating some aspiring
Nationalist like J. It. Lee, thereby producing
the impression that he wanted to keep a
place for Bruxner, the Progressive leader.
Maybe Oakes’s portfolio will also be re-
served for a Prog. But at present the Cockies
seem keener on creating a third, if not a
fourth, Cabinet vacancy in Namoi, where they
are running a fairly strong team against
Wearne, the Lands and Forests man, Cliaffey,
Minister of Agriculture, and the Laborite
W. J. Scully, who was presented with a seat
won by his brother P.C. In 1922 the Progs,
very nearly got a quota in Namoi, and on
this occasion Wearne. their former chief (he
is now a “Coalition Nationalist”), is finding
the going, difficult.
Anzac Day coincided with the exposure of
one of the most callous examples of exploita-
tion of the patriotic sentiment yet provided.
It was contained in the official statement of
the result of the T.B. Sailors and Soldiers’
Art Union (N.S.W.), drawn Oct. 30, 1924.
Ticket sales and donations amounted to
£7281. of which £1259 went in commission and
£2941 in prizes ; printing, etc., took £1216;
office salaries and secretary’s allowance, £622 :
still more etceteras, £228. The afflicted
heroes benefited to the extent of £948. A
belated Government regulation provides that
in future 40 per cent, of the gross loot shall
go to the charity supposed to be concerned.
Notwithstanding that, a considerable loss ot
enthusiasm for this branch of patriotic
effort” may be anticipated.
Candidate Fitzgerald, of the N.S.W.
Progressives, says his mob will not join
any other herd in doing things for the good
of the State unless it gets more than halt
the portfolios. Its numbers may only entitle
it to three out or 12, but it will sulk in its
tent on full pay unless it gets at least seven.
When there are sufficient small factions of
shameless and mercenary portfolio-hunters
like that, office presently goes to some
minority which may possess not a single
virtue save coherence.
The walloping of joss Theodore by his
one-time worshippers is becoming an every-
day occurrence in the “movement.” The
A.W.U., which called him in to whitewash the
persons accused of responsibility for the ballot-
boxes with the sliding panels, was smitten
to the heart by his expressed opinion that
some of them were too discolored to admit
of the process, and has been waiting round
the corner for him ever since. The other
day he had the pluck to tell a Townsville
audience that there was nothing wrong with
the Italian immigrant, barring his tendency
to concentrate instead of spreading, and that
the country was sorely in need of more popu-
lation. To which Dunstan, secretary of the
Queensland branch of the A.W.U., bitterly
replied that the ex-Premier was hopelessly
out of touch with the A.W.U. and “the
movement” on the Italian issue; in fact,
there was no difference between his attitude
THE SPATTERED IDOL.
“Walsh Island dockyard has been declared black.”
and that of Bruce. This attack may have
political consequences, for Theodore was for
several years president of the organisation
whose secretary is now pitching into him,
and without A.W.U. support he cannot hope
to win the Herbert seat.
Judge Cohen has finished his inquiry into
the question of cutting N.S.W*. into smaller
States, but when this was written somebody
was still sitting on his report to keep it
warm. An uncontradicted statement is that
the document is what everybody expected-
in other words, it proposes that nothing be
done at present, the time not being ripe nor
the auspices favorable, but that the matter
may be again considered by the Circumlocu-
tion Office at a later date. Nobody imagined
that the colorless Fuller appointed the undis-
tinguished Cohen with a view to anything but
a foregone conclusion —the one that would
give two uneventful city products the least
trouble.
When it was introduced there was a
flourish of trumpets about section 8 of the
Industries Preservation Act, which purports
to protect Australian industries against the
competition of countries which would
otherwise be able to knock them out owing to
depreciated currencies. How effective the
section really isn’t was shown when the
English Electric Co., whose works in Vic-
toria and N.S.W. have been badly hit by
big importations of dirt-cheap transformers
from Italy (as well as Sweden), asked to
hs.ve it applied. The Customs Department
answered that it could not use the section
against goods the produce or manufacture of
Italy, because that would be contrary to a
treaty of 18S3 between that country and
Britain. Australia does not want to em-
barrass Father Bull in any way, of course;
but the Australian Government will have to
tell him that he mustn’t make any such
treaties in future, and must get Australia
cut out from the provisions of those he has
made.
The defeat of the Drys at the Westralian
liquor referendum lias been followed by a
beer strike, the sturdy trade-unionist who
likes his stingo demanding a cheaper pint as
a consideration for having voted continuance.
No doubt beer is dearer than it need be in
Westralia, as elsewhere, but Bung can argue,
reasonably enough, that,the price he charges
is conditioned by the insecurity of Ins busi-
ness, which is constantly menaced with de-
struction by fanatics to whom trade-union
politicians pander, and by the high cost ot
preparing his case at the periodical refer-
endum. Also, on the -point of gratitude, that
the trade-union politicians now in power
brought in a bill (the Leg. Council rejected
it) making licenses terminable without com-
pensation by a bare majority. If the trade-
unionist’s job were dependent on expensive
plebiscites he would, of course, scorn to ask
for a wage-rate in which the factor of uncer-
tainty was taken into account, and after a
costly victory he would voluntarily work tor
less money. {Still, there is something to be
said for Bung’s side of the case.
First it was shops, next it was ships, now
it is examination-papers. The Queensland
State Service Union applied the tarbrush.
But, unfortunately for schoolboys, it doesn’t
apply to all exams.: it was merely the out-
come of a controversy between the Public
Service Commissioner and the State Service
Union on the question of examinations for
the position of assessors and assessors’ clerks
in the Land- and Income-tax Offices. Several
vacancies had occurred, and the Commis-
sioner had decided to examine the aspirants.
The Public Service Union considered this
departure from practice a gross interference
with the right of the public servant to be
as ignorant as he darned well pleases; and
the motion that the exam, be declared black
was carried without one dissentient.
Westralian Minister Troy, on a visit to
Hobart, assured an interviewer of his abso-
lute confidence that 90 per cent, of the people
of his State would gladly vote for secession
if given the chance. Why not get busy
instead of being a Troy-wait Ministry, and
give them the chance? It would cost only a
few coppers for ink to add to every ballot-
paper at, next State election a line of four
words, “Secession, Yes or No?” and get an
expression of opinion for the Ministry’s
guidance. The argument would lend a thrill
to the campaign.
An Innisfail (N.Q.) firm recently landed
five bales of “newsprint” from a Brisbane
house. Four arrived per steamer and one
by rail. The total charges—freight, wharf-
age, insurance, transhipping, etc. —on the
four bales amounted to £5 13s. 4d., whilst
the freight only on the one bale by rail
amounted to £4 Os. 6d. And yet the Queens-
land railways show an annual loss of over a
million and a half pounds.
As the glory of Eight-hours Day in Mel-
bourne has departed the question is being
discussed whether it is worth while continu-
ing the procession. In recent years there
has been no settled date, partly because of
Eastertide and Anzac Day, and partly be-
cause of the Monday holiday rule in Vic. In
former times April 21 was a fixture for the
celebration unless that date fell on Sunday.
George V., then Duke of Cornwall, was so
taken with the parade in 1901 that he let
another engagement wait in order to see the
whole of the march past Federal Parliament
House. But that was something like a turn-
out.
At long last a trades union came across an
occupant of the Federal Bench who was not a
“sympathetic old Judge.” Certain moulders
struck in Melbourne for an increase in the
award rate, and simultaneously (April 22)
their union asked the Arbitration Court for
the same increase. Deputy-President Quick
didn’t wait for the florid explanation that
the union officials were doing their feeble
best to keep the wheels of industry going. He
told them to get the strike off by two next
afternoon, or else exnel the strikers from the
union with the same brevity that is used with
men who refuse to leave off work when
ordered. Till then the union was instructed
to keep out of his Honor’s sight.
The latest scheme for settling the un-
troubled North comes from S. Australia, and
has had a public meeting held about it.
The idea is to establish a “Black State”
populated with Australian aborigines who
will govern themselves by means of a Parlia-
ment and political parties in the usual way,
with a white Governor who will have power
of veto. The hope is that black capitalists
and black industries will arise, to be fol-
lowed, of course, by a black Tom Walsh to
declare them chestnut or blonde when they
threaten to become prosperous. The scheme is
no worse than others recently advanced, and
has the merit, anyway, of not violating the
White Australia policy.
April 14 was a great day for militant tee-
totalism. A launch belonging to H.M.S.
Bacchus, which is a thirsty name for a ship,
ran into a barge laden with beer, and there
were six casualties. On the same day a
Kurd, aged 151, who had probably led a
double life and aged rapidly, testified that
his length of days was due to the fact that
he didn’t drink. Perhaps the picturesque
old liar would be 251 years old by now if he
had taken a nobbier at intervals —say, every
quarter of an hour.
A matter attracting the attention of
women’s organisations is the legal status of
British women who have married foreigners.
At present such women forfeit their nation-
ality and acquire that of their husbands, and
on several occasions this has been the cause
of marked hardship. Several other countries
have introduced measures by which their
female subjects may, if they so desire, retain
their nationality upon entering into matri-
mony with a foreigner; and representations
lately made to the Government have brought
forth a promise that something will be done
about it in Britain.
Profit, said Maxton, M.P., at the Indepen-
dent Labor party’s conference in England,
is robbery. The habit of a wheat grain of
multiplying many times is, of course, vice,
and the custom of a sheen of having more
than one lamb is immorality. Nevertheless,
it is these idiosyncrasies that induce men to
plant wheat and keep jumbucks.
Greater Brisbane’s Mayor and 20 aider-
men went home the other night with their
first pay. His Worship had £B3 6s. Sd. in
his envelope and the rank and file £33 6s. Bd.
each. It shouldn’t be long now before they
are equipped with the rotundity of ye olde
English Bumble.
By agreeing to take over bridge construc-
tion and maintenance in Melbourne the
Metropolitan Board of Works has removed
one of the Allan-Peacock Cabinet’s difficul-
ties. A bill will be necessary to give the
Board power to raise loans and levy rates,
and spanning the Yarra at Spencer-street
will be one of the first projects. The advan-
tage of delegating authority to the Board is
that it has the administrative machinery.
Sewerage and water rates may be lightened
at the time the bridge levy is imposed, and
while Parliament is extending the Board’s
functions it may authorise an increase in
the number of members from 40 to 51 —
which will make it just one more than 10
times too many.
Few countries have the good fortune to be
presented by the outside world with a ready-
made educational system in return for an
act of brigandage involving the massacre of
many resident foreigners and the sending of
a large army to clear up the mess. But it
is the case with China, which has had its
Boxer Indemnity returned to it in the shape
of professors, medical missions, colleges and
universities. Uncle Sam started the notion
and Britain followed ; France has now agreed
to devote part of the six millions still owed
her to this purpose. Thus the Confucian
schoolboy can dissect frogs, study industrial
methods or handle microscopes without hav-
ing first to attend morning prayers and sub-
scribe to Christian dogma, a price the mis-
sionary bodies exact in nearly all their
schools. This circumstance alone will give
an enormous impetus to Chinese industry,
already well on the way to Westernisation.
TO ANZAC GHOSTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I do not know If I could trace
The outline of one laughing face,
Or tell what color were your eyes.
I have not spent my heart in sighs;
From war’s raw ends I’ve spun new ties.
Though one died nobly at Quinn’s Post,
And one, a standard-bearer’s ghost,
Still bravely guards his strip of coast,
And he fell first who was my dear,
I have not found the decade drear—
I’ve laughed and danced and savored cheer;
I’ve kept no vigil for my dead.
But if across my days chance led
A soldier lacking joy, or bread,
I’ve done my best to right his wrong.
To you I hymn no pasan, no song.
The skies are blue, the years are long.
But Anzac’s wife and orphan, too,
Still stir my heart to spend and do —
This is my monument to you!

“.Tcobb” : For sheer grit and determination
let me nominate Mrs. (jeorge Hunter, a girl-
mother of 18 summers, 12 of them tropical
ones, who at the end of February, in the
middle of the Territory’s wet season, started
out with her two tiny babies from the buffalo
reserve at Woolner, 50 miles from Darwin,
for dental attention. She was suffering
intense pain at the time. The journey was
impossible on horseback, so, taking two old
blacks to help carry the infants, and a swag
consisting of a blanket and mosquito-net,
with a younger black to hunt for food, she
set off on her long journey through tropical
jungle and tall, rank grass. Following the

just passed.”

buffalo tracks, to leave which would have
meant death in the slimy bog. they reached
Adelaide River at nightfall. The following
morning found the river a banker and not a
canoe within miles; and incidentally the
tucker-bag empty. An attempt to construct
a raft failed, so there was nothing for it
but that a couple of the “boys” should swim
the river and search for a canoe and pro-
visions on the other bank. For 24 hours
the mother and babies camped on the bank
with no shelter from the pouring rain. At
daylight the “boys” were seen on the other
bank with a canoe, which was worked across
the flooded stream, and the party having
been safely transported the journey was con-
tinued on foot through the flooded country.
Swollen creeks were forded or swum, and
the girl and her babies reached her parents’
home just on midnight the following day.
The infants were none the worse for their
wet trip, and the mother, except for swollen
feet, was well. The loyalty of the blacks
calls for three cheers; besides doing the trip
in, they almost at once undertook the return
journey to Woollier to tell the anxious hus-
band, a buffalo shooter, of the safe arrival
of the wife and children.
“The Ghoul”: The corpse had been dragged
out of the Yarra, and, at the morgue, duly
identified by Mrs. Pyner as that of her late
beloved husband. An undertaker was ap-
proached and asked to prepare a funeral
do luxe and hang the expense. The cadaver
was duly dolled up, with trimmings galore.
The widow asked to be allowed one last look
before the body was screwed down. The
request was, of course, granted ; but it
proved to be the undertaker’s undoing. With
the handling the mouth fell slightly open,
disclosing a gold tooth. There was a scream,
and then : “That’s' not my husband—’ e ’ad
no gold teeth!” With characteristic phi-
losophy the undertaker afterwards addressed
the corpse thus: “There you are now, that’s
what you get for opening your mouth too
wide. If you hadn’t have done it, you’d
have had the best funeral in Melbourne!”

“H.J.J.”: Towards the end of the war
“salvage” was an added burden to the front-
line men, and many a weary tramp we had to
retrieve old junk that eventually gained some
salvage fiend a meritorious service medal.
The curse fell upon some of our fighting
officers who were otherwise decent sorts. One
drizzling night that was rent by the usual
harsh noises and decorated with lurid
splashes that may have meant a blighty or
a blanket for somebody, we were shambling
out to rest after three days’ spent in soaking
shell-holes near Flers. On the duckboards
our officer kicked an old boot, and promptly
retrieving it in his stride handed it to the
Digger behind him. “A real good boot!
Take it in!” he commanded. Then he stepped
off the duckboards to wait and see how the
men at the rear were coming along. With a
weary but full-sized curse the Digger promptly
flung the boot into the mud. A few
seconds later the officer, hurrying from the
rear, kicked it again and, once more retrieving
it, caught up to the leading man. “Here’s
another boot! Now we have a pair!” he
brightly informed the Digger, who was just at
breaking point. “Yes,” the weary Billjim
answered drily. “If we keep goin’ we’ll win
the war,” he quietly added as he slipped
the boot down into the muck again.

“Centurion”: One Breasted, an alleged
Yankee authority, has been proclaiming the
discovery of an Egyptian papyrus-treatise on
rejuvenation, and claims on the strength of
it that Yoranoff is a plagiarist. But the
search for the elixir
of youth is as old
as that for the
Philosopher’s Stone
—the magic com-
pound that turned
baser metals to
gold by its touch.
King David in his
old age sought re-
juvenation by hav-
ing batches o f
young handmaids
to cherish him in
their bosoms, if the
book of Kings is to
be believed. The
sorcerers of the
Middle Ages pre-
scribed a course of
eating the flesh of
young children, or
bathing in their
blood, and so did
Gilles de Retz,
Marshal of France.
In much later days
De Mo n te s p a n
sought to regain
her fading youth
and beauty by sub-
mitting herself to
the nameless
obscenities of the
Black Mass. So
the gamut has been
run to our own
days,. when the
dumb beasts of the field and the greenwood
tree—if the monkey can be called that—are
robbed of Nature’s inheritance that old idiots
of either sex may avoid a little while longer
the high cost of dying.
“Bridge Road”: Again and again Death
missed his mark by inches or seconds when
the Richmond (Melbourne) explosion opened
an opportunity for him. The explosion left
merely a gap in the side of the street where
the premises in which it occurred had been,
and it made over a score of adjacent build-
ings look more or less ruinous. One man
had been delayed to add a postscript to a
conversation, so, instead of being exactly
opposite, he caught only the edge of the
explosion, and even that toppled him to the
ground. That was an extra touch of Provi-
dence, too. because he thereby just missed
a flying sheet of tin which sailed over him
about breast-high. A young man whose bed
was under a front window facing the scene
of the explosion missed his tram, and, hav-
ing to walk home, got there after the explo-
sion to find a bulk of wood lying on his bed.
Two friends who had been talking at a door
had just parted, and the door had been closed,
when a solid bit of glass embedded itself in
the panels. A little girl in a house two doors
away, also under the window, slept on whilst

bricks crashed through the panes. Had she
sat up in fright she must have been caught
by the flying bricks and broken glass. People
next door had taken an unusual holiday from
home. Altogether, although the explosion
took a large toll of property, not a single
person in a crowded neighborhood was hurt.
* * * *
“Tabac”: The death of Rose Scott, Syd-
ney’s Grand Old Lady, will recall memories
dating back 40 years and more. In the
little salon at Woollahra many of the fathers
and mothers of folk whose names dot the
society columns were tactfully engineered
on the matrimonial rails by the spinster who
headed her sex in revolt against man-made
institutions. She was, though averse to
the condition herself, a very thorough be-
liever in marriage. But catholicity was at
the basis of her creed. There was scarcely
any “crank” movement with an urge of
humanity behind it that could not gain her
ear. Her weekly assemblies drew their mem-
bers from all classes, from the Judge on the
Bench to the little factory-worker, from Min-
isters to the budding politician of the School
of Arts Debating Club. I remember meeting
William Lane there in July, 1893, when the
Royal Tar was washing its wooden sides in
the harbor ready to sail for New Australia.
Lane was no squire of dames, and the groups
of chatting girls in their bright dresses and
with still brighter faces made a contrast to
the homely-dressed leader of the pilgrims of
socialism. But Rose Scott soon set all that
right, for with the charm and tact that
were to her a capital beyond price, she made
him speedily at home. It was perhaps the
closest contact with any kind of attain-
able socialism “Bill” ever made. Lane was
not a born leader, but rather a student and
enthusiast. He could not shout commands,
but had much the same capacity as his host-
ess for winning followers by sheer earnestness
and a personality that drew men to him—
often despite their commonsense.
* * * #
“Sixenate”: The joke-arranging arm of
coincidence has had a few turns, as usual,
in this year’s batch of Victorian divorce
cases. One woman whose husband had gone
away to a job near the N. S. Wales border
and simply faded out decided, when the.
Melbourne Cup arrived, that, even if she had
no money, she might as well see the big race.
As she was having her buckshee view
from the Maribyrnong heights, the voice of a
man a couple of paces away caused her to
look in his direction. It was hubby—dear
old hubby, justly indignant to see her there.
Another unexpected discovery was made by a
man who was married in Montreal, Canada,
but lost sight of his wife when he went to
the U.S.A. in search of a job. After serving
in the war he came to Australia. One day
he went to Collingwpod to see about some
advertised employment, and the thirst for
cigarettes took him into a small, shop. His
long-missing wife was handing him over the
fags when she gave a scream of recognition.
She was sharing the shop and other things
with a man; but the application for a
divorce had to hang fire until domicile was
established.

“X2X” : Although the law that sentence of
death shall never be carried out on an
enceinte woman was once rigorously observed
in England, it has apparently fallen into
disuse, a woman in such a condition having
actually been executed during the last few
years. When Mrs. Edith Thompson and
By waters, the ship's steward, were sentenced
to death in 1922 for the murder of the
former’s husband, it was energetically pro-
tested that the woman could not be hanged
for the above reason; but the then Home
Secretary refused to be moved, and the sen-
tence was duly carried out. In Australia
such a reason has been advanced to save a
woman from the gallow T s, the last occasion
in Victoria 20-odd years ago, when a woman
and her lover were convicted of slaying the
former’s husband. Both were sentenced to
be hanged; bht it was reported that the
female prisoner was enceinte, and on this
being confirmed her sentence was commuted
to a term of imprisonment, from which she
was released only a year or so ago. In that

case no jury of matrons was empanelled; and
if such ever has been done in this country, it
must have been a long time ago. Such
matters are nowadays decided on a report by
the prison surgeon and the Government
Medical Officer, or by the latter alone.

“Ree”: How is this for the long arm?
When a child, in a village in England, I
was walking home from church one Sunday
morning with my parents, and picked up
a tartan handkerchief. Pinned to it was a
small brooch of very uncommon design. My
people could not find the owner, so allowed
me to keep it. Years afterwards I emi-
grated to Australia, finding employment
with a family in a suburb of Melbourne—
entire strangers to me. A week or so later
the lady of the house, noticing my brooch,
told me she had lost one similar in design
years ago in a certain village in England. I
asked her if she remembered anything else
about it. She told me then that it hap-
pened on a Sunday morning, and that at the

time the brooch was attached to a tartan
ribbon. Other particulars followed, which
left me in no doubt that the brooch had
found its rightful owner at last. I handed
it over —and, I might add, was very hand-

“Schnorrer”: The “Back-to-the-land”
movement amongst the children of Israel,
which is represented in the U.S.A. by at
least one big agricultural settlement, in South
America by several, in Mexico by a very con-
siderable new settlement on land provided by
the Government, in the Ukraine (South
Russia) by the allocating of a district to
Jews, and chief of all in Palestine, has an
example in Victoria. In the Shepparton dis-
trict there are a number of Jewish farmers
Who are the survivors of a co-operative at-
tempt to make a Hebrew settlement. Israel
Cohen, who came to Australia as an emis-
sary of Zion, says in the book he has written
about his travels that the settlement num-
bers 200 souls; but he must have counted in
the bull-ants and grasshoppers. Still, there
are enough Hebrew names on the district
register of fruitgrowers and farmers to cause
surprise to the casual visitor who thinks that
the Jew, when he is not a pawnbroker or
a moneylender, must either sell socks and
chiffons or carry a bag at the races.

“X.N.0.”: A queer story bearing, as told,
every evidence of truth is being retailed in
Sydney. It relates that no less than three
vessels, the Ivapanga, Ringarooma and
xailuen, all boijnd for Sydney during the
night of April 12 last, saw a vision of
H.M.A.S. Australia, and. what is more, en-
tered the occurrence independently in their
official logs. April 12 was the first anni-
versary of the sinking of the Australia under
the Washington agreement. As the three
vessels were bound from Auckland. America
and Ivongkong respectively, collusion seems
out of the ouestion. The boatswain of the
Ivapanga, William Morgan, recognised the
phantom, if such it was, beyond possibility
of error, he having served in the Australia
and known her well. Frederick Calthorpe,
Professor of Oriental Languages, adds a
sinister touch to the storv. inasmuch as he
is stated to have overheard three foreigners-—-
nationality left to the imagination—dis-
cussing the occurrence the following morn-
ing. To them the vision appeared as a “red
and raging menace.” while to others—Aus-
tralians and. Britishers—the phantom was a
distinctlv friendly one of the guardian-angel
tyne. In view of Drake’s Drum, which
Admiral Sir Percy Grant heard at Jutland
when in command of the torpedoed Marl-
borough. and the Angels of Mons. it is to b>
boned first-hand stories will be obtained and

“Sucre”: Can a clergyman, licensed to
marry, marry himself? A case happened at
Gracemere (S.Q.). A young minister
courted a station-owner’s only daughter
against the wishes of her dad. Elopement
being a sin, he performed the marriage cere-
mony between the object of his love and
himself, supported by the necessary wit-
nesses. Were they “truly and sufficiently”
married ?
“Merris”: I can support
“Ex-Dix.” (B. 9/4/’25) con-
cerning the difficulty of
downing a ’plane from the
ground by rifle or machine-
gun-fire. In March, TB, in
front of Ypres, a Hun air-
man spent some pleasant
afternoons shooting up our
front-line syst e m. The
moment he appeared every-
thing within range would
open up on him, but after
skimming about just over
our heads and potting at us
from all angles for half an
hour or so, he’d wave a
friendly paw and fly away
home unscathed. He came
so low on one occasion that
it gave even Darky an idea.
“If ’e’d only ha’ bin ’arfan-
hour later,” croaked that
well-known character, “I’d
ha’ got ’im ter ’ump this stoo
upter th’ front line fer me.”
“Skipper”: Airmen have
told me that rifle and
machjne-giin fire from the
ground troubled them not at
all, but that well-directed
Archies were calculated to
put the wind up the boldest.
Hundreds of bullets can rip
through a ’plane without
doing much harm, but a shell
is a different proposition.
Throngh my glasses one day
I saw an Archie get one of
our ’planes. One moment
the ’plane was skimming
gracefully along; the next
there was just a whiff of
smoke hurtling earthwards.
“Herodot”: When a friend was trusting
enough recentiy to post a letter containing
a five-pound note which duly failed to arrive
at its destination, the post-office inspector
gave him some interesting advice. This was
to the effect that if one must post a bank-
note in an unregistered envelope, the safest
way to do it is to fold it inside thin brown
paper. The experienced sorter can tell ex-
actly the nature of the contents of most en-
velopes, simply by the sense of feel. He can
distinguish between a postal-note and a Trea-
sury note, even when they are inside an
accompanying letter. Some, indeed, have
been known to tell a five-pound from a one-
pound note —the sizes are (afferent. But this
“feel” cannot penetrate brown paper, and
hence the safety of the method. Ordinarily,
of course, the sorter is not interested; but
there comes a time when something goes
wrong, and the man suffers who puts tempta-
tion in the other’s way.
A DISCOUNT FOR FRIENDSHIP.
VICTIM: “'Well, how much are they?”
FAIR BRIGAND: “ They’re a shilling each; but, as you’re a friend,

“Munjong” : Sagacious dogs were the sub-
ject of an argument lately, and if the belt
has been awarded I’d like to challenge the
winner on behalf of a tyke belonging to
Blank, who lives in our town. The terrier
lias been given, each morning for several
years, a penny which he exchanged with the
local baker for a bun. For some days it was
noticed he took the money into the garden
and buried it. Blank was naturally puzzled
until yesterday, when passing the baker’s he
noticed a card in the window offering seven
penny buns for sixpence. Previous to this
Jllank took little pride in the dog, but he
has started to skite about his pure-bred
Scotch terrier.

“Clement R. d’Uppe”: The S.M. at New-
castle (N.S.W.) was presented the other
morning with a prospect that would have
dismayed the most intrepid beak that ever
signed a charge-book. Intent upon an indi-
vidual cross-examination of a bankrupt, who
had been running a “lay-by” shop, over a
hundred women creditors came flocking to
the courthouse. Each had rancor in her
tongue, malevolence in her demeanor, pug-
nacity in her eye and a dress-him-down inten-
tion in her mind. Stentorian cries of
“Order!” went forth unheeded as the credi-
tors flocked in and entered into complete pos-
session of the courthouse. The only two
places they jibbed at were the dock and the
Bench. When pandemonium was at its meri-
dian, the S.M. made a final sally, and sug-
gested that the examination should be
adjourned until the creditors had obtained
the services of a solicitor. He further sug-
gested that all hands subscribe a bob each
towards this. With manifest reluctance the
suggestion was adopted, and to the clinking
of coins and the echoes of vituperation the
bankrupt took his way hence through a side
door.

“Bay Webb”: No such thing as luck?
Seven years after Batman had chosen his
site for a village, two shipmates compared
observations collected during a roam around
the settlement called Melbourne. They pro-
posed to start a pub. One was for seeking
a site in the centre of population ; the other
thought there would be more money at a
halting-place, where travellers would have
to await the convenience of a ferryman, who
might be tipped to assist the business of an
adjacent bar. Since agreement could not be
reached, the chums went each his own way.
One established his pub in Bourke-street; the
other went three miles out, and supplied
refreshment within hail of a ferry that car-
ried practically all the traffic between the
settlement and the vast sweep of “up-
country.” To-day the site of one house is
worth about £l5OO a foot; the site of the
other, perhaps, 60s. Within hail of the
old ferry there is scarcely an inhabited dwell-
ing. and after 80 years the old pub was re-
built only last year.
“Hasen”: If the American tourists on the
Carthinia (B. 2/4/’25) resemble those of
the Belgenland, which was in Hongkong a
while back, local
Jewry should look
to its supplies of
Kosher meat. A
modest estimate
labelled over 75 per
cent, of these
world-trippers as
Hebraic. And Aus-
tralia may expect
to be stunned on
the vessel’s arrival
by a noise like an
explosion of the
O o in m o nwealth
Bank. The air
about the Belgen-
land was heavy
with millions. We
were informed in
an awed whisper
that one suite cost
its lessee for the
trip a matter of
50,000 dollars
(this, of course, as
passage-money and
not including inci-
dentals) ; also,
that one lone widow
aboard owned up
to 80 million dol-
lars. Curio-dealers,
sellers of silks and
brasses and the
like had no time to
waste on ordinary
mortals while the
invasion was on.
The party saw
Hongkong in a sort
of endless, fever-
ishly-writhing ser-
pent of motor-cars.
As it was supposed
to see all China in
a couple of days’
stay at Hongkong
and about the same
at Shanghai, the
feverishness can be
understood. This new expedition may easily
consider the “one day for Auckland and
Wellington” altogether too long.

“Woorook” : In the days when the Roto-
rnahana, recently sold, was the Carbine of
the Pacific, she bumped a submerged rock
off Maoriland and knocked a hole in a man’s
reputation. It was just before dawn that
the accident occured, and the bump was re-
peated several times with such eclat that the
passengers woke with a sudden idea that
they had either shipped an earthquake or
collided with Mt. Cook. Most of them acted
accordingly. It was soon discovered that
no damage had been done to the vessel, and
the excitement subsided into talk. But one
passenger, the much-travelled man who seems
to be aboard every vessel, was still perturbed
and even angry. One of his shoes was miss-
ing. He declaimed against the folly of get-
ting panic-stricken, the necessity for cool-
ness in danger, the absurdity of getting ex-
cited over a mere bump, and in general
terms accused his cabin-mates of being re-
sponsible for the loss of his shoe. “Some

idiot,” he declared, “probably got so excited
he couldn't tell the difference between it and

At that stage someone pointed out to him
that he still had his trousers on back to front.
He fled below, and in adjusting his attire dis-
covered the missing shoe—in the seat of the
inverted pants.

the hope that they would facilitate a reconcilia-

If to bring back a wife who’s flown
Fair words prove inconclusive,
The seeds of victory may be sown
By language that’s abusive.
Scorning entreaty she will roam,
But blanky dash may bring her home.
If blast-and-b'lithering does no biz,
Do not despair, but, rather,
Describe just what her mother is,
Tell all about her father.
Her kindred limn in language raw—
Thus homeward you a spouse may draw.
“Come home, dear love,” oft proves a waste
Of gentle advertising ;
But fire at her some words unchaste,
And, with high anger rising,
The wife will come for vengeance wild.
’Tis then you may be reconciled.
For, if apology she claims,
An easy one’s presented;
Just say the words at which she flames
Were for this reason vented:
Strong language only could express
The love for her you would confess*
But I can give no guarantee
Whether, when reunited,
The married pair will happy be,
Or by more curses blighted.
Yet those who would lost wives recall
Deserve whatever may befall.

Those record profits for the year are a full-
sized reflection of the wonderful wool and
wheat prices. And there is quite a. chance
that all that was won had not got into the
accounts by the time they closed on March
31. The wool and wheat sold late last year
and in the first quarter of the current year,
of which sales the Bank of Adelaide financed
its full share, meant the crediting of the
bank’s customers to the extent of their indi-
vidual sales. But the bank would not receive
the corresponding volume of cash until deli-
very had been made overseas. Even then
the money is paid into the London branch;
and the unwieldy accumulation of funds in
that centre, which has resulted in Australia’s
exchange troubles, has made the transfer to
Adelaide (or any part of the Commonwealth,
of course) a problem, and an expensive pro-
blem at that. This has forced Australian
banks to curtail advances in order to main-
tain adequate provision for call liabilities,
and that position will hold until funds in
London are transferred by one means or an-
other to Australia. This is one of the rea-
sons why in the Commonwealth at the pre-
sent time, with extraordinarily rich returns
from wool, wheat, sugar, silver, zinc and
lead, with record coal production _ and good
returns in other lines, money is tight. An-
other reason is the £72,000,000 of Federal
loans maturing towards the end of the year.
Although not disturbed at the amount, the
banks are “playing safe.” But to get back
to the Bank of Adelaide’s profits. _ Although
last year’s were of record dimensions, there
have been relatively better. Capital has in-
creased by £375.000 since 1920—£125,000
was raised in 1921 and a quarter-million m
1923. In addition, there are almost £200,000
more reserves at work than there were in
1920. Twelve years ago capital and reserves
were .iust over the million, yet the profits
were £81.138; last year funds of £1.682.741
won £117,216, a difference to the advantage
of the earlier year of roughly 1 p.c. Also,
it is a l’easonable assumption that the inter-
nal resources are more than proportionately
greater. Here is how grouped balance-sheet
figures have moved :

There is nothing out of the way in the year’s
changes. Despite the increase of £174,5(2 in
deposits, advances contracted by almost a
round quarter-million. Here, however, com-
parison is difficult on account of the move-
ment of S.A. Government money not being
shown separately. The bank maintained its
liquid assets at the high percentage. which
has been characteristic; the proportion, 56
p.c., was a point greater than last year.
Although the bank has its own branches in
Perth, Melbourne and Sydney its risks are
largely concentrated in sober, solid S. Aus.,
and are governed chiefly by two commodities
—wool and wheat. Thus it probably feels
it necessary to have more than the 40 p.c.
liquid usually considered adequate. The same
factors apply even more strongly in the rela-
tion of the volume of the bank’s own funds
to its holding of public money. The propor-
tion accepted as safe is £1 to £8; but the
Bank of Adelaide holds just over £4 for each
£1 of its own funds, and there is exceptional
strength there. On March 31 all but
£2,982,781 of liabilities were backed by
liquids ; and for that amount were advances
and premises with a written-down book value
of £1,436,198 and £273.076 respectively. And
there are the invisible resources. Last year’s
profits were equal to 13.4 p.c. on paid capital.
As £807,741 of accumulated profits were help-
ing the return on total visible funds was
7 p c., which, in view of the big proportion
kept liquid, must be accounted good.

As a result of the reconstruction last year
the Board had £11,310 to dispose of after
providing £2892 for depreciation. .1 he
4$ p.c. debentures got their interest, but the
5 p.c.’s received only 2 p.c. This debenture
stock emerged out of the re-arrangement.
The old debentures fell due on Jan. 1, 1J24.
For a long time revenue had been insufficient:
to meet interest and rent, but debenture-
holders held their hands, simply because there
didn’t seem anything else to do. The re-
arrangement provided for certain lessors (the
Emu Bay-Waratah section of 48 miles was
held under lease at an annual rental of
£lO,OOO from the Emu Bay and Mt. Bischoft
Railway Co., Ltd.) selling out, and thus
reducing the yearly payment from £lO,OOO to
£5890. The consideration was £130,900 of
41 p.c. irredeemable debenture stock (for
the lessors’ debenture stock holders), and
the co. issued 5 p.c. irredeemable debenture
stock for its own debentures (£172,000) and
for its interest arrears (£97,064, but of this
amount £2OOO was apparently paid in cash) ;
and £61,500 in 7 p.c. non-eum. A profs.
Arrears of pref. divs. to the amount of
£40,000 were wiped out and the div. rate on
the old prefs. (now called “B’s”) lowered
from 8 p.c. cum. to 6 p.c. non-cumulative.
Ordinary capital was written down sufficient
to balance the accounts. The capitalisation
of arreai-s and the writing off has made little
real difference. Revenue was a shade
better, but there was no significance in the
increase. The co. has lived for years on
hope: hope that Electrolytic Zinc might
bring life and bustle to Zeehan, or that a
kind-hearted Government might take over the
whole system. Whatever vague chance de-
benture-holders may have of ultimately
obtaining something, shareholders have nope
unless some force or factor at present invis-
ible comes to nlace the co. on its feet. Here
is a clear view of the year's movements: —
1923. 1924.
Debentures .. .. .. £172,000 £397,964
Pref. capital .. .. .. 100,000 183,571

Arrears of pref. divs. . . 40,000
Sundry creditors . . .. 2,571 10,336
Accumulated losses .. .. 80,545
Apart from the debenture debt, liabilities on
Dec. 31 amounted to £19,261, which were
represented by cash (available and on fixed
deposit) £22,351. Book debts, stores and
odds and ends amounted to £18,637; the rail-
way was in tfie books at £576,887; the
humorous goodwill item still figured at
£lOO,OOO. The increase in the fixed assets
reflects the purchase of the section formerly
leased. The railway manager reported the
various sections of the road in fair to good
order.
No claims for interest on the 5 p.c. deben-
tures can be made unless it is earned, and
unpaid interest does not accumulate against
the earnings of future years until 1934.
The prefs., too, are now non-cumulative. The
co. deserved better luck; it opened up the
West Coast of Tasmania and did much for
the Speck. But the mines petered out or
refractory ore made most of them unpay-
able, and the deadweight of £lOO,OOO good-
will was a handicap which hampered the co.
even in its best years—and the best were
bad.

The year was not as successful as the one
on whose heels it trod, but ordinaries got
10 p.c., a new factory was added to the
already extensive business, and prospects are
bright, so the decrease is of little moment.
The smallness of the addition to reserves isn’t
accidental: the directors’ attitude is that
there is no advantage in creating reserves
merely to distribute them at some future date
as bonus div. or bonus capital. They prefer
to study existing shareholders rather than
people who might speculate on the market.
And that is perfectly sound, always provided
shareholders realise that their dividends are
liable to fluctuation; for obviously if the
directors pay out almost everything in a good
year, they can’t pay the same rate in a year
of trade depression. Reserves of £109,597
are claimed by the accounts ; blit this Column,
following its practice of not regarding good-
will as an asset, reduces that figure by
£65,702. Towards the close of the 1924 year
the co. secured a contract for the supply of
architectural terra-cotta for the very large
structure in Martin-place for the N.b.\\.
Savings Bank, and a factory is going up at
the co.’s Rosehill works. This represents a
new industry, and as the product is becom-
ing popular with architects, it looks like
another money-maker for Wuiiderliclis.
The profits in the introductory table vary
from those shown in the accounts. The dif-
ference is due to the co.'s admirable profit-
sharing scheme. Last year the profit dis-
closed was £48,354. Dividend appropriations
accounted for £35.600 and £609 passed to
reserves; of the balance £2470 went in a 5
p.c. div. on staff partners’ shares, and £9670
was allotted for other such shares and for
the superannuation fund. So far as the
investor is concerned the introductory table
gives the net position; nevertheless, lie is
entitled to judge that the existence of these
staff-partner shares makes the goodwill ot
the business more solid. Since 1918 the votes
in this direction have been :

The figures in the profit column of the intro-
ductory table suggest that the 10 p.c. looks
reasonably sure; but that has to be read with
a previous remark about the Board s policy.
British Australian Cotton Associa-
tion, Ltd.—The drought affected last years
crop, anticipations went awry, and the re-
sult was a loss for the 12 months ended
Anmist 31 of £19,004. Production of seed
cotton was greater at 15.396.2861 b.
(12.000,0001 b. in 1922-23 and 4,000,0001 b. m
1921-22), but was so much less than had
been expected that only five of the co.’s .main
ginneries were worked. On top of it all, and
doubtless arising out of it, there was a Board-
room difference, the upshot of which was
that Crawford Vaughan resigned Ins posi-
tion as mart aging-director, and, later, Ins
seat on the Board. The belated report puts
it this way:—
A recommendation by the Finance Committee in-
volving drastic retremhment of overhead and admini-
strative expenditure contemplated by the managing
director but which the majority of the Finance Com-
mittee considered not justified was... .approved by
the directors, involving a saving of many thousands
of pounds in this and future year’s outgoings. _
Meantime the growers had been stirring.
Under an agreement with the Queensland Gov-
ernment all cotton produced in that State
has to be brought to the co.’s gins for treat-
ment. That agreement has two years to run.
But a movement was started for the estab-
lishment of co-operative gins, and the Board
could see all kinds of unpleasant things
happening after the expiration of the agree-
ment The Queensland Government first was
asked to relieve the co. of the enterprise;
then it was asked to guarantee the interest
on so much of the capital as was represented
bv physical assets. Lack of success left
only one way out: growers were offered an
option to purchase the physical assets of the
co. excluding cash, book debts, stock, etc.,
on'certain conditions. If the option is exer-
cised the farmers will hand the co. deben-
ture bonds for the amount of such valua-
tion bearing cumulative interest at 8 P-9-
p.a. This has been agreed to by the Council
of Agriculture acting on behalf of the
Queensland growers. The growers are to be
"iVen representation on the Board. Die
agreement provides that steps be taken m
the following directions: —
Extension of Government guarantee.
Removal of certain injunctions against ratoon
cotton.
Increase of production.
Minimum guaranteed price for term of years.
Cotton to be brought under Queensland Pools Act.
Cotton Commodity Board to operate for five years.
After payment of 8 p.e. interest and depreciation,
half of profits to be used for purchase of the assets
of B. A. Cotton under option or for cash bonuses to
growers.
In plain words, the growers have forced the
co. to terms. B. A. Cotton had pioneered
the industry (previous efforts were unim-
portant), and put more than a half-million
into the new venture; but that aspect has
not been allowed to carry much weight with
the farmers.
So far as the investing public is concerned
interest centres in what is going to happen
to the shares. Prefs. are preferential as to
divs. and assets in the event of distribution.
There are £200,000 of them: 8 p.c. cum., par-
ticipating with ordinaries to 10 p.c. On
paper they are well secured :
Capital .. .. •• •• ..£657,808

Net tangibles on August 31 had a book value
of £396,007; but buyers of railway sidings,
roadways and cotton-seed oil-mills are few
and far between. However, there is the
agreement with the Council of Agriculture,
and the assets represent almost £2 of security
for each £1 of pref. capital: or, allowing the
bare cover, £196.007 is left to represent the
361,335 ordinaries (£3415 of calls is in
arrears), equal to just on 11s. per share. It
is almost unnecessary to state that ordinary
shareholders arc making a fair-sized noise.
In addition to the expenses incidental to every
float, B.A.C. had practically to pioneer the
field and propagate the idea of cotton. Hav-
ing placed the industry more or less on its
feet and seen their co. within measurable
distance of divs., ordinary shareholders now
stand to lose not only t’ c probable return
on their investment but portion of their capi-
tal as well. That pref. shareholders are be-
ing saved and holders of ordinaries sacrificed
is the claim of a section. But the danger ot
co-operative ginning plants was a danger-
sign not lightly to be disregarded by the
Board. Even if the growers had made a
hash of the business, this co. wouldn’t have
been any better off if in the process B. A.
Cotton had been left with idle plant.

This is another beef exporter fallen upon
hard times since the profit-inflation repre-
sented by the Imperial meat purchases ended.
In six years shareholders have had one lone
div. —6 p.c. But worse than the 1 p.c. aver-
age is the decrease of £89,434 in reserves.
There has been nothing brilliant in it for
shareholders from the beginning. The old
Q.M.E. did well, especially in its later years.
In 1915 the new co. took over the meatworks
at Pinkenba and Townsville and the Aus-
tralian Stock Breeders’ Co., Ltd., was
formed to handle the station properties. The
old co. had a paid capital of £191,062,
although visible reserves of £178,800 had
accumulated. The A.S.B. had paid-up capi-
tal of £218,330 and the new Q.M.E. paid-up
capital £654,967. It was a remarkable feat
of arithmetic. Still it must not be forgotten
that the competition from the Argentine was
not as keen then as it is now; not only has
S. America extraordinarily strong advantages
in the matters of breeding and nearness to
markets, but wages and conditions there are
not comparable with those ruling in Aus-
tralia, and strikes and go-slow are dis-
couraged with emphasis, not to say enthusi-
asm.
In spite of the long dry time the financial
position is quite comfortable: —

Director of Army Contracts (England) !ms
recently given preference to Australia for a
substantial contract for tinned meat, it is
by no means sure that the Argentine lias
reached the limit in production. That is the
utmost that can be said. And unless prices
improve prospects of divs. are far aom
bright. The market places the value of the
shares at 95., which discounts the value or
the plant and property almost altogether, as
the surplus of liquids is equal to Bs. 3d. per
share On past experience of pastoral cos
the time will come when this will be a good
gamble. The problem is to pick the time.
Choisetjl Plantations, Ltd. —After 13
years of struggle, this Burns-Pliilp infant
pays its first dividend. The areas were
taken up in the German Solomons in 1912,
because British ideas on indentured labor
did not square with the co.’s plans. By
1919 the first plantings of cocoanut palms
were producing, and by 1921 6552 acres
were carrying 368,303 trees. Last year net.
profits were £7553, all but £o3 being taken
by a div. of £5 per share on the 1500 tully-
paid £lOO shares. Undistributed balance
amounted to £1469. The copra crop ex-
ceeded estimates (output was 1235 tons),
and increased prices added to the result.
The condition of the co.’s five estates is re-
ported satisfactory and labor supplies suffi-
cient. The position on Nov. 30 was solid,
all liabilities amounting to £4007, against
which were more or less liquid assets _ot
£17,702, with cattle (reported to be doing
well), shipping property, field plant and the
plantations in the books at £144,4 <o.*
Adelaide once tried to obtain control of
the Radio group of mines, Southern Cross
(W.A.), by the straight-ahead route, and
failed. On'that occasion an option was first
obtained over the Radio, followed by an en-
deavor to repeat the process over adjoining
eastern leases. But by this time eastern
leaseholders guessed that an amalgamation
was in view, and they opened their mouths
so wide that Adelaide abandoned the cam-
paign. After allowing lease-owners two
years for repentance, approach was made
by a different track. Options over the eastern
Deeps were first secured, then the bait
(£40,000 cash under working-option agree-
ment) was thrown to the Radio, which took
it in haste. About £5OOO deposit is to be
paid, and Radio and Deeps will doubtless
be amalgamated in due course in order to
prevent a recurrence of the Edna May and
Edna May Deeps fiasco. In the latter case
the reef dipped over the boundary at 470tt.;
in the case of the Radio it is calculated
Deeps will receive the ore-body at 370 ft. So
far as Deeps is concerned, the Radio reef is
not its only chance, as the Hansel Mundy
Co., which has the option, already lias six
miners developing wliat is known as the Green
Harp lode with a view to increasing reserves
and obtaining sufficient bullion to obviate
calls. #
Empire Extended had bad luck with its
option over the Salvation mine, Marvel Loch
(W.A.). Two years ago the co. worked it
for some months without disclosing the good
things it contained and then gave up. They
were within a few feet of a lode from wliic.l
the prospector-owners have since won hun-
dreds of tons of ore of an extraction value
of £lO per ton. Better still, the workings
show that similar stuff awaits shooting out.
But how much there is of it is not known.
Wiluna (W.A.) main shaft has been deep-
ened to 210 ft. A heavy inflow of water has
delayed operations, but the men have been
offered inducements to sink to 300 ft. and
crosscut the required 50ft. to the lode before
.Tune 30. At that date, if developments con-
firm the satisfactory drill disclosures, Lon-
don will have £400,000 waiting to purchase
and equip the mines. Another concern, the
Emu, is drilling near the continuation of
the lode, and, as good values were won from
shallow workings near by, there is a chance
of good developments.

Ives Reward (W.A.) with the new battery
is handling 1500 tons a month. What it
started to worn on in January was 2000
tons of ore at grass worth about 425. a
ton. Reserves underground were: Above
the 118 ft. level, 25.000 tons, averaging 455.
a ton; above the 200 ft. level. 21,000 tons,
of the same grade; on the Blue lode._ 8800
tons, averaging 445. a ton. So with 54.800
tons to play with, a fair-sized campaign is
in sight, while development goes on to re-
place the ore broken. Costs have run out
at about 30s. a ton. but with the mine
opened up further and the plant under full
steam, the figure can be reduced. Of late
work has been concentrated on establishing
connections between 200 ft. and llSft. on
the main lode, and in driving north and
south. To test the width of the formation
bores put out east and west have established
that the mine at 200 feet carries a big shoot
of ore. East of the north drive a new run
of quartz was picked up which so farhas
gone 535. a ton. A length of over 200 ft.
of ore is already exposed at ._ooft., or -'Oft.
longer than at the upper level. Development
on the Blue lode of late has been not
altogether satisfactory. The co.’s capitalisa-
tion is big—over £103,000. It owes £6OOO
to debenture holders, £6721 to a kindly fetatt
Treasurer, £3941 to sundry creditors and
£2860 to its banker. Accordingly it needs
a fair spin to get rid of creditors and
reward shareholders.

A gratifying report has been issued by
Keith Ward, director of mines in South Aus.,
for 1924. The value of the mineral produc-
tion of the State is greater by £54,636 for
the 12 months, being £953,238 tor 19-4 and
£B9B 602 for 1923. Ore from the Iron Knob
for tlie 8.11. P. Newcastle Steel Works
accounts for £667,354: it gave 580,308 tons
worth 235. a ton. This is the record out-
put. Limestone and gypsum show an in-
creased output, and more salt was harvested
than in any previous year—62,6B7 tons
valued at £141,046. The schedule of
minerals is worth recounting because S.A.
is the only State that troubles to mine roost
of them—silver, gold, lead, copper, iron,
manganese, asbestos, barytes, tale, clay,
gypsum, limestone, magnesite, ochre, opal,
flint pebbles, phosphate, soapstone and
arsenic. To date S.A. has raised £42,123,211
worth.

Recently “a large mass” of bitumen was
found near the Glenelg entrance, which
S- Aus. Oil Wells considers definite proof
of another seepage. Meantime the co. is
busy casing No. 2 bore, which is now down
to 538 ft., so that the gas and oil-sand can be
drilled into with a minimum of water in the
hole. Thera is a lull in the talk of ‘oil pro-
duction at an early date.”

A new industrv is being given a chance
at Point Addis, on the coast beyond lor-
quay (Vic.), by .Tarosito Products, Ltd.
Jarosite is a sulphate of iron and potassium,
occurring in seams in the high cliffs on the
ocean beach. The chief product will be a
red oxide for use in paint manufacture, other
uses being for coloring cement work, pottery
and tiles. By-products are fertiliser, sul-
phuric acid and sulphate of potash. So far
treatment has been confined to laboratory
research to discover an economical process.
The Jamieson quicksilver-mine 13 miles
by pack track from .Jamieson (Vic.), is be-
ing brought to life again in Melbourne. 1 lie
press reports from the promoter, P. Martin,
read as though the facts were new and
modern. It is stated that O. A. L. \\ lutelaw
and A. G. Holroyd, who reported on the
mine “some time back,” advocate further
sinking of 60ft., being of the opinion that the
shaft will reach the sulphide zone. A. G.
Holroyd reported on the mine about 25
years ago, and even then water hampered
liis inspection. The shaft was 140 ft. deep
with two short drives at 50ft. and 80tt.
Since then, many years ago. a bush fire
wiped out the plant and machinery, and the
shaft was full of water to the surface. To
re-open the mine means sinking a new shaft
and making a road round the shoulders of
precipitous mountains.
The requiem of the Antox gold and anti-
mony mine at Costerfield (Vic.) is near at
hand as the directors have decided to close
down. Recent returns show a fall in ton-
nage, and expenses were not covered. The big
makes of ore had cut out, and the small
ones did not afford enough ore, although
high in gold and antimony. The bottom levels
were in faulted country, and probably this
is the main reason for stopping work. The
Australian antimony market is limited and
stocks are in excess of demand. The ore
and concentrates could be sold abroad, but
freight, exchange and a lower price for gold
made export sales unprofitable. The average
assays of 51 tons shipped last month were
51 pc. antimony and 3oz. 2dwt. gold. Man-
ager Doyle has made a gallant fight, and to
him are due many improvements in machinery
and treatment. Bob Beeston. an old Sand-
hurst shareholder, spent a fortune on the
old Costerfield mine till he found out the
difference between high assays and low re-
coveries.
Applications for the new issue of 2500
shares in Mt. Isa. Ltd., will he received up
to May 21, and the transfer books will be
closed for the week preceding that date.
Raeh allottee will receive a certificate giving
him the right to acquire a further like num-
ber of shares from the co. at par on or before
April 30. 1926.
Last week the Black Star No. 10 shaft at
Mt. Isa had attained a depth of 255 ft., and
has been in solid sulphides since sinking re-
started. Another 50ft. or 100 ft. will be
tacked on to this depth, but at present bot-
tom the shaft is in dense primary sulphide,
and going down assays have ranged from
IS p.c. to 38 p.c. lead. 5 p.c. to 20 p.c. zinc,
silver up to 40oz. These figures may not
represent the average values for the width
of the shaft, but thev show that values are
well maintained in depth.
Silver Spur, near Texas (Q.), is turning
out good zinc ore, and Edgar Hall is shipping
small parcels direct to Europe while the
zinc market remains high. Unfortunately
the silver is rather low for sulphides. Within
the past two months 150 tons have gone to
Antwerp, estimated to average 35 p.c. zinc,
12 p.c. lead and lOoz. silver; gross value,
between £6 and £7 per ton.
* * * *
The Two Jacks tin-mine, Ivoorboora
(N.Q.), re-opened last month on a small
scale. How long it will continue will be a
matter of luck, as the present faces at the
150 ft. are too low-grade to pay (200 tons
recently crushed went under 2 p.c. concen-
trates), and the co. is on the outlook for
better ore. The last crushings from tribu-
tors went over 4 p.c. for 340 tons; but even
allowing for the fact that the tributors knew
where to pick their ore, the co. ought to
he able to manage over 2 p.c., which figure
is its minimum. The Two Jacks has been
the standby of this district, and if it can
succeed there will probably be money to
re-open the Tennyson and other adjacent
mines.
* * * *
A promising outcrop of cobalt is being
opened on the Queen Sally lease, nine miles
north of Koolamarra, Cloncurry (N.Q.). It
has been sunk on for 20ft. so far, and one
shaft has given very high cobalt assays—up
to 28 p.c. metal. If the samples can be
relied on as averages, a width of 4ft. is
worth about 14 p.c., a high grade for cobalt.
Another shaft is being sunk 50 yards away,
and has struck the lode formation and good
values. Ore is being bagged in small quan-
tities and sent into Cloncurry.
The Perseverance fluorspar mine, 11 miles
from Chillagoe (N.Q.), gives promise of im-
portant production. The lode has been
traced at the surface for about half a mile,
and a number of shafts and potholes have
shown a lode from 2ft. to Oft. wide for a
length of 1000 ft. The syndicate is supply-
ing B. H. Prop, steelworks at Newcastle
with a 90 p.c. crude ore, and 2500 tons have
already been shipped from shallow depths.
Considering the size and the high grade of
the deposit, the syndicate is considering pos-
sibilities of markets outside Australia, and
has adopted a definite development scheme.
At present a main shaft is being sunk to
cut the lode at about 100 ft. Davie Hughes,
the prospector, still retains a big interest
in the show.

When the wet season ends in the Northern
Territory a minor rush is expected to the
new goldfield south of Tanami, discovered
late last year by Wickham and Laurie. Old
Tanami will also receive attention from the
Northern Territory Minerals, N.L., of Syd-
ney. This co. is despatching an expedition
headed by J. T. Beckett, late Chief Inspector
of Aborigines in the N.T., who has been
over most of the N.T. and the Kimberleys.
A mining-engineer will be included in the
party, which will travel by motor-lorries.
Inspections will be made of the Flora Belle
and McKinley leases, out from Brock's
Creek, on the Darwin-Pine Creek line. Other
well-known old mines along the same line are
in the hands of Melbourne cos., which talk
of spending money in development.
A good year’s dredging has been done by
Tongkah Compound No. 2 plant. What is
better still is that from 0.7691 b. ground
£48,036 worth of tin was won. With royalty
off, the net value of the ground averaged
11.978 d. That fact drives home what a good
market for tin means to the dredge master.
The co.'s average price for tin oxide Avas
£144 Bs. a ton, or as much as was one time
received for the metal itself. The result is
that from practically the same grade ground
as was worked in 1923, another ljd. profitwent
into the till, or an addition of profits for the
year of £9237. Costs are a bit on the high
side at 6.613 d., but the plant responded by
lifting 820.787 cub. yards during the year.
Out of £18.480 profits, 3s. went to holders,
and with good yields continuing another
shilling was handed out early in April. AH
the main area save 97 acres is worked out,
but there is a block of 92 acres of 0.51 b.
ground to the east and still another 100 acres
of 0.71 b. ground to the south to be dredged.
Barrister Meagher expects that the co. will
be successful in acquiring this last block.

Takuapa Valley hasn’t got full steam ahead
yet. Once more the market was stampeded
when a cable announced that the co. had
not yet taken over the plant, and that pro-
duction was held up pending alterations.
All this only served to confirm the suspicion
that the regular drop of 6d. a day for some
days previous was the upshot of sales on
stable account.
* * * *
Close boring (40 bores to the acre) over
three acres ahead of the Tongkah Compound
dredge, in order to check dredge recoveries,
gave 1.291 b. tin oxide per c. yard from the
first 43 bores. .791 b. for the next 37. and
.761 b. for the final 32. The values were ap-
proximately the same as originally charted,
so the boring Avas discontinued.
The Penang director of Siam Concessions,
N.L., cables that he lias obtained a free
option over 3600 acres adjoining Takuapa
Valley Co.’s area. Of the block 400 acres
have been proved lib. value for an average
depth of 42ft. A further option over 2400
acres at Surat has also been taken.
The fire at the Burma Corporation’s mine,
one of the world’s greatest silver-lead pro-
positions, which was considered unimport-
ant when it was first found, subsequently be-
came serious. At the end of December only
15 p.c. of the stoping area was affected. In
February there was another outbreak and
two-tliirds of the main ore body had to be
sealed off. Accounts were issued in Decem-
ber, and results had been so good and pros-
pects looked so favorable that increased divs.
were declared. Following on the fire, out-
put was maintained at 75 to 80 p.c. by
special measures, but profits will not be in
proportion, for the cost of fighting the fire
will be heavy.


"TO HIM WHO MOVES THE STONE.”
A WISE old duke once rolled a large stone into the middle of the road.
Many men passed, but all walked around until a new path was
worn around it.
The duke then put his shoulder to the stone, which, being hollow,
was lighter than it looked, and, rolling it aside, took from the hollow a
great purse filled with gold. On it was written, “To him who moves the
stone.”

If. the umpire’s whistle blew in M.L.
Parliament it would only need one emergency
to make up a XV who have gained rep.
honors at Bugby. No other Parliament in
Australasia can boast of such a record. In
Victoria Parliament has adjourned on Mel-
bourne Cup Day; but the adjournment in

“Vandorian”: An abiding memory of the
wit and wisdom of Bose Scott is an answer
she gave a few months ago to the question,
“What was your first impression of life?”
based on the known fact that she had been a
singularly perceptive child. “I was about
three, when I stroked the back of a soldier-
ant, and it stung me. I have sometimes been
stung since then, but never in a way that so
completely disillusioned me.” A few weeks
ago her memory dwelt on the former injus-
tice done to women brought to the police cells
on such charges as vagrancy. “Though Mr.
Fosbery, then Inspector-General, told me
that only the best constables were chosen
to attend to women who were generally too
tipsy to even undress themselves, I managed
to interest Colonel J. C. Neild, M.L.A., in
the need of women policemen to relieve men
of such work. To his warm support in
introducing a women’s deputation on the sub-
ject to the Acting-Premier, Mr. Brunker, is
chiefly due the reform, which, by the way,
was instituted in London about the same
time.”
Melbourne City Council has lost its oldest
member, Aid. Burton, who was just on four
score. After his first election in 1893 he had
to fight for his seat only once, and then came
the aldermanshio which made it unnecessary
for him to face the electors at all. Mel-
bourne was struggling to find itself in '55
when young Burton, a lad of 10, dropped
from London with the rest of his family to
claim a home, and started coachbuilding.

The late T. G. McCawley, who was a tiger
for work, was president of the Queensland
Arbitration Court as well as State Chief
Justice. As a result of his tragic death the
positions are to be separated, Justice Blair
becoming C.J. and W. F. Webb Arbitration
Court president, with a seat on the Supreme
Court Bench —he is destined for the southern
district when Shand, J., retires. Queens-
land-born both, Blair had a notable political
career, while Webb succeeded McCawley as
Crown Solicitor. Like the latter, he is' one?
of the late T. J. Byan’s young men (Crown
Solicitor at 30, he is only 38 now), and the
then Premier took him to England when the
McCawley case was going before the Privy
Council. He has had no experience of indus-
trial affairs, but the belief is held in Aus-
tralia that a man who fixes hours and wages
is better without it.
As a result of the Bruce-Page arrangement
that the sitting member is to get the official
support of both Nationalist and Cocky
organisations, Massy Greene is reported to
be weakening on his oft-expressed determina-
tion to have a return contest with Boland
Green, whose defeat of the sometime Defence
Minister was the surprise of the 1922 elec-
tions. But a soldier-brother of the stopgap
Senator has been prospecting the electorate
(Bichmond, N.S.W.), in which he used to
cow-farm, and there may be another Green-
Green e go after all. The military Greene
served thoughout the war, first with the
Light Horse and then with a Tommy artil-
lery brigade, and returned with the Military
Cross and bar.
Wm. Good, stock and station agent in
Collins-street and Ivyneton (Vic.), has taken
the express for Eternity, after a remarkable
record of travel. He came from Ayrshire
to Australia 57 years ago, and for* 40 of
them he went daily, six days a week, from
his home in Ivyneton to his Melbourne office
and back again. He thus covered approxi-
mately 1,368,000 miles by rail and spent in
a railway carriage seven out of his 40 years
of business life.
G. H. Cargeeg, dead in Perth at 74, was

ters at law, softgoods, the Begister staff, and
publication for Allerdale Grainger of a short-
lived Australian Star.
MISS ALICE HENRY , organiser of the

John Bobertson, just dead at Narracoorte
(S.A.), at 82, was one of a family which
reached the fertile south-eastern district of
that State by way of Melbourne and Port-
land over 60 years ago, and made its
homestead, Struan House, famous in the
neighborhood. Old John was a cross-country
rider in his day, and had been out with
Adam Lindsay Gordon. Later he was an
owner of racers, and for years acted locally
as starter. He was also a notable judge
of sheep. He never married.
Died recently in England, Professor A.
Dendy, eminent zoologist, who in his time
filled chairs at the Universities of Melbourne
and Christchurch (M.L.). He was Pro-
fessor of Zoology at King’s College, London
Uni., at the time of his death.
In Byron (N.S.W.) the A.L.P. has fallen
back on B. T. Gillies, brother of Queensland
Premier Gillies, as one of its trio. Gillies
was excluded from the selection ballot on
the technical point that he had not three
years’ continuous membership of an A.L.P.
branch. Although he has been a branch
member for over 20 years, he slipped two
years ago because his regular branch at
Burringbar lapsed for the season. For this
enormity he was too “black” to contest a
selection ballot, but is now white enough to
contest the election proper because the with-
drawal of schoolmaster Tom Murray left the
A.L.P. heads in a hole. Many years a dairy-
man near Burringbar, Gillies delighted in
expounding his Labor views to his diehard
neighbors in the opposing camp. His pen,
moreover, was capable of a sardonic humor
which cut his ponderous antagonists to the
marrow. A philippic on the child-sweaters
of the dairying industry was perhaps his best
effort. It appeared in The Bulletin in
August, 1911.
“T.P.” : The Vic. Teachers’ Union of past
days had formally introduced deputations to
such Ministers as Campbell, Sargood, Prof.
Pearson, etc., in which speeches were deli-
vered standing, replies were listened to in
sacred (if not scared) silence, thanks were
reverentially expressed, and members backed
bowing to the mat. Then young Alec Pea-
cock came along, and I was on the first
deputation. He received us in his shirt-
sleeves. Asked us if we smoked. We did.
so did he. Our M.P.-introducer was cut
short with “All right, old man, they’re
TOM GLUYAS, M.L.C., of Adelaide.
teachers —let ’em go ahead. Don’t stand,
don’t make speeches, talk it.” Someone
hazarded a joke, and for the first time I
heard the laugh which rings in my ears even
now. That deputation took one-third of the
usual time. Later some young fellows pre-
sumed upon this genial friendliness and
absence of Xlinisterial swank, but only once,
for they left the room like hunted rabbits,
the sole difference being that their tails were
between their legs. I saw him yesterday after
nearly 40 years at the game. He has become
battered and burly, but with energy unim-
paired, if the laugh be excepted, and with
increased popularity as far as teacher-
unionists are concerned.
Melbourne is at last to have a worthy
State. High School. On a 12-acre block on
the Yarra bank at Forest Hill, Prahran, a
fine brick building, Gothic in design, is to
go up at a cost of £50,000 or £60,000. One
of the features will be an assembly-hall
capable of holding the whole school, 750
boys, on ceremonial occasions. The struc-
ture should bear the name of the chief advo-
cate for its erection —Frank Tate, Director
of Education. When he sees it and the ter-
raced garden in its foreground he will look

N. A. McKell, appointed assistant-manager
of Sydney Ferries, Ltd., is best known fol-
ios association with the recent big shipping
hold-up. McKell was manager of the over-
seas shipping companies’ labor bureau, which
for seven years had prevented the Waterside
Workers’ Federation from running a success-
ful strike. So long as McKell’s Diggers were
available, the union could never assert the
power which it wielded in the days of Billy
Hughes’s presidency. McKell got a horrid
shock when the shipowners made peace with
the maritime unions on the basis of the
bureau’s abolition. Until the news reached
him officially from Melbourne he could not
believe it, as he had always? supposed that
the bureau would be the last thing the ship-
ping companies would sacrifice. The pass-
ing of the shipping labor bureau freed
McKell for his good, new billet. The only
thing the waterfront regrets about it is that
its creation becomes necessary through the
illness of W. A. Mackenzie, the general
manager.
T. F. Davies, once Clerk to the Westralian
Arbitration Court, is now President of that
institution, and it is Justice Burnside, his
old chief, that he succeeds. A Labor Govern-
ment gave Davies tin' job; a previous Labor
Government made him Perth P.M. instead
of the late Gus
Boe, that dry old
humorist h av i n g
offended the Trades
Hall somehow. On
G. A. Sherard’s
death a few years
ago Davies became
Mas te r of the
Supreme Court. He
is very industrious
and so affable that
he used to convey
the impression,
when finin g a
“drunk and dis-
orderly.” that it
pained him to dis-
please the gentle-
man in the dock.

Ex-M.L. Premier Joe Ward has decided to
contest Invercargill, a seat which had been
held by Joe Hannan for donkey’s years, and
which he will not contest again. louseph’s
mana is great in Southland; he represented
the adjacent electorate of Awarua nearly the
whole of his political life. Big Business
recognises the lack of financial genius in
M.L.’s Parliament, and in this field Joe
Ward has few peers.
Gone on a longer journey, at 67, Johann
Wenke, a survivor of the famous overland
trek of German settlers from S. Australia
to the Upper Murray in 1567. So success-
ful were the first migrants that many more
followed, and Albury (N.S.W.) became
largely German.
W alter Sneddon, builder of bridges, has
just died, aged 88, in Maoriland. He con-
structed the Makohine Viaduct on the N. I.
Main Trunk line, the greatest engineering
feat till then attempted in Maoriland, and
he built one of the first iron bridges. He
also fitted up the first Woods reaper and
binder in the Dominion, and gave it its
initial trial in the great grain-growing dis-
trict of Canterbury. A Scotsman, of course,
but 61 years in Maoriland.
“Machete”: Time has converted many a
sinful Pagan into a Christian saint, and the
process goes on. In a recent John o’ Lon-
don’s Weekly, there is an article on
“Martyrs of Science.” For instance:—
Another worker for science, Dr. Fox, of Melbourne,
lost his life in the course of experimenting with a
snake-bite serum. While examining some snakes in
the Calcutta Zoological Gardens, he received four
punctures on the wrist from a venomous snake. He
applied some of his serum to three of the wounds,
but overlooked the fourth. A few hours later he
was found dead in bed, where he had gone to rest
after his fateful experience.
If poor old “Professor” Fox, of Botany and
George-street, with his sugar-bag full of
snakes, could have forecasted such an obitu-
ary, he would have died happy.
Dr. N. D. Boyle, the youthful Sydney sur-
geon who recently acquired the degree of
Doctor of Medicine of Sydney University for
his explorations in anatomy, may yet step
into the shoes of the late John Hunter,
whose friend and collaborator he was. While
in the U.S. last year he attracted attention
by his work in connection with spastic
paralysis, and a number of honors came his
way. Since his return he has not only taken
the Doctor’s degree in medicine but the Ethel
Talbot Prize as well, and is now engaged in
further research work at the ’Varsity, with
some surgical practice in between.
“Mary Scott”: I took tea one day last
week with a cheery advertisement for the
North. Mr. McLean, of Devereaux Creek.
Mackay, will be 93 next birthday, and can
still read his newspaper without glasses, and
discuss the sugar surplus problem and “Ne
Temere.” The old gentleman came to
Queensland in 1882 from the Mauritius,
where he had been manager of a sugar-
plantation, has lived in the Mackay district
ever since, and will probably round' the cen-
tury if the climate does not change.
THE OLD CORNETIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is a narrow street and mean,
Where garbage-tins, o’er-flewing, lean
Against each dingy post,
Yet on the vapid wind that blows
Past houses cramped in huddled rows
Wanders a plaintive ghost.
One single-fronted cottage dim,
Meek unit oi' a terrace grim,
Breathes out its timid soul
In airs old-fashioned, feebly played,
That tremble off to die dismayed
Where the loud lorries roll.
So faintly comes each halting note,
So wraith-like are the songs that float
Along the grimy ways,
One thought must every hearer strike;
Cornet and cornetist alike
Have lived through better days.
You picture him in some back room
Where one cracked pane lets in the gloom
Of a low, sullen sky;
Between four grimy walls and bare,
A meagre bed, a broken chair,
A burst portmanteau fie;
Old clothes on nails behind the door,
Some tattered books upon the floor,
Torn towel, broken comb,
And ’mid these household gods he sits
With shrunken limbs and failing wits,
And quavers “Home, Sweet Home.”
Do ampler echoes sometimes come
Of trombone or euphonium
Harmoniously bland ?
And is he, as he sits bereft,
The last, forlorn survivor left
Of some forgotten band?
He may have once known merry airs,
And blown defiance at his cares
With measures swift and glad,
But, withered by the outlook grey.
Spirit and mirth have dropped away,
And all his tunes are sad.
Yet they can please one critic ear,
For, in his majesty drawn near,
Death, like a shadow, stands,
Charmed by some simple plaint that wakes,
Listening a moment ere he takes
The cornet from those hands.

has no competitor
as a rabbit destructor
It is safe and sure. Although certain death to rabbits,
when blown into the warren in the form of dust, it always
appears plainly as a smoke cloud whenever it reaches a
warren opening. It is thus harmless to the operator.
Inside the warren it gives off deadly fumes for at least
twenty-four hours, so that no rabbit can escape.
More effective and economical, non-
inflammable, non-explosive.
The Fumo Dust-Blower has been speci-
ally constructed for its application.
Light, easily portable, simple and con-
venient.

ABORICINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES - LINSEED OIL
“Bouragi”: A detailed description of the
discovery by a Papuan magistrate of pigmy tribes in
North-West Papua some three years ago, and of sub-
sequent visits, has been made available. Their dis-
SOMEBODY MIGHT BE ANNOYED ABOUT IT.
VOICE FROM BELOW: “Come down, yous blokes, we'll 'arc
ter 'op it — we’re pullin’ down the wrong building!”
coverer, Mr. Leo Austen, considers them identical in
type with those discovered by Wollaston in Dutch
territory some years ago. They were found
at a height of 10,000 feet, far up the watershed of
the Fly River and close to the N.-W. boundary of
Papua and the Mandated Territory. The negrito
race to which they belong has an extraordinarily wide
distribution, being found in the Congo forest, the
Andamans, in the Malayan and Philippine mountains
and in India, while the now extinct South African
Bushman was of the same breed. The African and
Papuan sections furnish a curious analogy in the
matter of costume. While the Congo pigmies are
naked, according to Sir Harry Johnstone and others,
the Papuan pigmy’s “costume” consists cither of
a small nutshell or, as one goes higher up the great
range, of the curved narrow neck of the gourd, so
familiar to Papuan travellers. The long extinct
South African Bushman wore exactly the same article
of “clothing.”
“Riverina”: Leg-pads (B. 39/3/’25) have
been used on horses in a good many parts of Australia.
Some years ago, when we were stripping a crop at
Wagingoboremby, near Wagga (N.S.W.), we found
Californian thistles so bad in the wheat that the
nags were afraid to face them. We padded the
animals’ legs with layers of sack and canvas, and
equipped thus they waded through without protest.
* * * *
“C.H.W.”: The evening flight of the star-
lings, noted by “Up Top” (B. i9/3/’25), makes a
fine sight; but a still more stirring one is provided
by the mutton-birds as they round up the sardines
in Maoriland’s southern harbors. The birds—-millions
of them—follow great shoals of panic-stricken fish,
and the circling and swooping of the immense
flock make a remembersome sight. The whirring-
roar of wings easily equals the noise of a large express
train. A gluttonous orgy follows when the fish are
finally trapped in shallow water. The birds gorge
till many are incapable of flight, and spend the night
far from their nesting-places—the islands further
south.
* * * *
“Nitric”: “Bad Australian” says (B.
2/4/’25) that “if the rum had been any good at all
the snake he put in it would have vanished.” An
old Dane once showed me why he imported rum and
drank no other spirits. He had three bottles, one
containing whisky, one brandy and the other rum.
In each he had placed a piece of leather. In a year
the whisky had nearly eaten the leather away and the
brandy had more than scored its surface and stiffened
it, but the leather in the rum was practically un-
marked and flexible. 1 will admit that soda will
neutralise the bite and corrosive action of whisky and
brandy to a great extent.
“Snowy”: Tell “Jacky Roo” (B. 2/4/’25)
that, Pears’ Encyclopaedia was nearer the truth than
his old hand. Two aloe plants on the Hunter River
(N.S.W.) flats have flowered at least three times in
the last 16 years; and a clump in the Bingara public
school playground flowered annually for at least five
years, to my knowledge. Incidentally, the fibre of
the leaves was used to make good an inadequate
supply of manual-training materials in the school.
The leaves were pulped and dried; the extremely
tough threads were then easily extracted from the
mass. After being soaked in water to render them
pliable, the fibres were woven into serviceable mats
and baskets by the youngsters.
“W.J.C.”: Let me nominate the lily
Arum, dracunculus as a more efficient trap for blow-
flies than “Wink’s” oleander (B. 26/3/’2f>). But it
isn’t as nice a house pet. It bears a large liver-
colored flower which stinks like carrion. Blowflies
mistake it for decaying flesh and lose no time getting
there; and once there they stay,
unable to escape. The stench
comes chiefly from the spadix, a
large and fleshy spike which bears
a mass of small and generally uni-
sexual flowers. This spike is pro-
tected by a liver-colored envelop-
ing leaf, the spathe, which also
exhales the stench. Spathe and
spadix are so arranged as to form
a fly-trap mechanism—and all for
the purpose of pollination. In
the case of “Winks’s” oleander,
the honey carries a neuro-
toxin, which acts so rapidly on
the blowy that paralysis gets him
before he can withdraw his pro-
boscis from the nectar. Apropos,
there are carnivorous plants which
trap insects in various ways, and
assimilate their soft parts for
nitrogenous elements. The but-
terwort (Pinpuicula) , which grows
on wet ground, has a basal rosette
of broad leaves, whose upper sur-
faces are covered with sticky
glands. Small insects are caught
on the sticky secretion and
washed by rain to the edge of the
leaf, which curls inwards and en-
closes them, The glands secrete
digestive ferments, the products
are absorbed, and the leaf unrolls
for its next charge. Sundew
(Drosera rotundifolia ) similarly
secretes digestive juices, and the
actual process of assimilation re-
sembles that in animals. The
insects are trapped on tentacles,
which will respond to the stimu-
lus of a stick, and exude digestive
fluid if a piece of raw meat is
applied instead. The bladder-
wort ( UtHcularia ), a submerged
water plant, catches small water insects in a bladder-
like structure; and there are others. Their carnivo-
rous habits seem to have grown from the fact that
they occur in swampy soil, where nitrates and avail-
able nitrogen foods are deficient. By developing the
insect-eating habit they became independent of the
soil.

“D.D.D.” Which native bird builds the
prettiest nest? The Queensland orioles would take
some beating, but the final choice would lie between
the robins and the fantails. The nest of the
scarlet-breasted robin is covered outside with small
pieces of bark, so that it blends with the tree.
Willy wagtail camouflages his neat little cup by
covering it completely with cobwebs, which are also
worked around the supporting fork, making the nest
appear a mere notch. The bulky nest of that sweet
singer, the ground thrush, is a beautiful thing of
moss, which remains fresh and green for years. And
the rose-breasted robin decorates the exterior of his
little open cup with bits of lichen placed artistically
one upon another, like the scales of a lizard ; in my
judgment, he is our champion nest architect. By
the way, the little corn-bird (golden-headed fantail-
warbler) literally sews leaves together with pliant
grass, and fills the hollow with soft nesting material,
in exactly the same way as the far-famed tailor-bird
of India.
TRANSUBSTANTIATION.
TRAVELLER: “Is that your pork on the road, Steve?”
STEVE: “Pork! Wodjer mean? There's a pig er mine there.”
TRAVELLER : “Ah, but a motor-car’s just been by.”
“Buttin”: “Boronia’s” par. (B. 9/4/’25)
on seed vitality may be “the oil” I’ve been looking
for. I have unsuccessfully tried to grow the desert -
pea, and some of my friends have had the same dis-
appointing results. I wonder if keeping them a few
years before planting would improve their germina-
tion, and what would be the minimum time required.
I would very much like to know how to introduce
some of our native plants into the garden. I have
never had any success with waratahs, Ghristmas-bush.
Christmas-bells and other varieties, and I don’t con-
sider myself a mug gardener either.
* * * *
“Troophorse”: Tell “Jimmy Possum” (B.
9/4/’25) the only sure method of keeping ants from
climbing on fruit-trees, particularly mangoes, is to
tie a few strips of rabbit- or ’possum-skin around
the trunk a few inches above the ground. For some
unknown reason the ants don’t or won’t cross this
fur entanglement. I have tried it on meat-safes and
ice-chests, too, with mobs of success.
* * * *
“Lomara”: It is gratifying to know that
not only the work of an Australian painter, but the
presentment of an Australian bushman, is to hang
in France’s famous Luxembourg gallery. Mrs. Rix
Nicholas’s picture is likely, nevertheless, to awaken
memories of wallaby farms and treacle-mines and
sheepruns at Woolloomooloo. Her “Australian’s” hat
may be passed ; the busliman’s hat when it has reached
the truly wearable stage takes on many forms of
shapelessness, and some, may affect the Boy Scout
pattern Mrs. Nicholas portrays. Her man’s shirt,
however, never was seen on range or plain. It is a
“slip-on,” yet it has also a close turn-over double-
collar, and its wearer sports a bow tie! A certain
amount of artistic license is permitted, but the .stock-
man who rides in shirt sleeves, with the sleeves
rolled to the elbow, does not wear a bow tie. In
truth, the stockman seldom rides in shirt and pants
except on stage and screen and in illustrations to
novels; a shirt provides no means of carrying watch,
pipe and matches. A waistcoat, usually open, is
almost invariably worn; and a handkerchief, white,
loosely knotted round the throat, is as much a part
of a bushman’s get-up as his chaps are to a film-
cowboy. It is a pity when the Australian stockman
is being given to the world that the dinkum article
could not be limned.
* * * *
“The Rumpus”: Up in Northern West-
ralia a teamster sub let a well-sinking contract to a
pair of hard-working Binghis, who were semi-
educated. The amount was under a fiver, and the
niggers demanded a cheque like the squatters gave.
The teamster was at a loss until he remembered
that the label on his last tin of jam was not unlike
the color of the cheques in vogue on the river.
Deftly he removed the paper from the tin, cut a cheque
size out of it. filled and signed it, and had it grate-
fully accepted by the grafters, who reckoned the
“tignature” was O.K. A week later they handed it
in at a store 60 miles down the river in payment for
rations received, and patiently waited for change.
The storekeeper, ticked with the joke, honored the
jam-label. When he had exhausted his fun out of
it, he joyfully passed it on to others at full value.
Finally it fluttered into the hands of the squatter
who had let the original contract, and a few weeks
later he handed it to the signee in payment for
wool carried down to port for shipment
* * * *
“Booth B.”: “Herodot” (B. 2/4/’25) is
right in saying that when dynamite is exploded under
water the sound is carried for a long distance, but
wrong in stating that fish are seldom killed by the
force of the explosion. In the Western Pacific,
whenever a quantity
of fish is required for
the'boys, care is taken
that the charge is
thrown among fish
that are in shallow
water, for by far the
greater number are
always killed, and if
the water was deep
they would not be re-
covered. In my par.
of 12/3/’25 1 ‘ stated
that more than a
thousand mackerel
were obtained on one
occasion; they were
nearly all collected
from the bottom, and
were quite dead. It
is very common to
find that the eyes of
fish are miss i n g.
“Herodot” says no-
thing about the size
of his charge, kind of
fish, or locality. My
charge was 20z.; kind
of fish, those that go
in schools, such as
mackerel, buma and
mullet; locality, the
Solomons, New
Hebrides and Equa-
torial Islands. Reef
sharks gather round
when fish are shot in
those waters, and the
natives have to do
some hurry-up swim-
ming to secure the
catch. At Santa Anna
one boy had a hand
bitten off, and an-
other lost half a foot.
Each attributed his
misfortune to an error of judgment on the shark’s
part, and both afterwards continued to swim down
among the sharks after the dead fish.
“Munjong”: “E.S.S.” (B. 26/!?/’25) asks
how I know that the color of captive crows’ eyes
change. I told him in the par. to which he finds
objection—l have seen the change. “E.S.S.” can
only state, in contradiction, that he has not heard
of it. His statement that he has watched birds at
work from a distance of 10 yards sounds thin, and
he must be exceptional if he can stomach the spec-
tacle of the black brutes mangling a live sheep for
sufficient length of time, and sufficiently often, to
make his observations of worth as evidence. Here-
abouts (south-west N.S.W.) the common magpie is
learning to feed from live animals, but so far 1
have seen them only at sheep of which the crows
(and, in deference to “E. 5.5.,” “cravens”) have
made a pretty thorough job.
“Caesar” : The wriggler which “Bad Aus-
tralian” preserved in a bottle of bad rum (B.
2/4/’25) is also a bad Australian —the ring-snake.
I don’t know the gent.’s scientific name, but I have
heard bushmen say that a bite from a ring-snake is
certain death, and that before turning up his toes
the victim takes as many fits are there are rings on
the reptile that nipped him. The ring-snake is a
rarity, however. I have seen only one myself, and
ANOTHER CROSS-WORD PUZZLE.
that was in my schooldays, when we boys rolled
a rock over and found a ringed crawler underneath.
The snake dived for its hole. One of the parti
suggested “catehin’ the tail and crackin’ the head
off,” but the majority was with an urchin who
“wasn’t takin’ any chance with a snake in a football
guernsey.”

TO JOHN, IN LONDON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A laughing-jackass was among the exhibits at
the National Cage-bird Show in London.”
1 know the feeling, Johnnie, for I’ve been
Exhibited in smoky London, too.
Not in a cage with bars to gaze between.
Like this confounded thing they’ve clamped round
you;
My cage was but a khaki uniform,
Which had its uses —kept a fellow warm.
But still it held me. How I cursed it, John,
Holding me there in that dank place of gloom !
But I got back ; those dreary days are gone
And I can pity you in your cold tomb
And w'onder if the laughter that we know
In our own bushlands sounds in Rotten Row.
Perhaps it never wakes; what cause for fun
Could you among those pasty fanes find,
Whose poor, starved owners never see the sun,
Nor know the sweet warmth of a southern wind?
How could you laugh in London’s clammy fog,
Who found your laughter on a stringy log?
How could you laugh, knowing the wattles bend
Under the burden of their fragrant gold,
Or that the parrots in the ti-trees blend
Their colors where the honeyed blooms unfold?
How could you laugh shuttered away from these
And all the bushland’s wondrous melodies ?
No! ’Tis no laughing-jackass, but a sad,
Poor lonely bush thing that they gaze upon,
With gloomy skies for the blue dome you had
And driving sleet for a warm sun that shone;
Meet for their pity only, where they stare,
Asking in vain for laughter over there.

“Fana”: Re the color of pure-bred dingoes
(B. 9/4/’25). At Wee Waa (N.S.W.), some years
ago, there was shot a native dog whose color-scheme
Was black and white, the head being black and the
chest and forepaws white. This specimen was a
pure-bred dingo, without the faintest trace of domes-
tic dog in him, and he was a particularly trouble-
some animal, while alive. Warrigals yellow or red
in color, with white forepaws, are common in dis-
tricts where dingoes are plentiful. I once saw a
skin which had white spots, something like those on
the native cat.
* * * *
“Wanchai”: At Colac (Vic.) a four-year-
old boy recently had the skin of a finger punctured
by a spike on a caterpillar cocoon which he had pulled
from a tree. He became delirious, and the family
doctor found it necessary to amputate the digit.
Several days later the arm had to be taken off and
a piece of mortified bone removed from the right
foot. Sawbones fears that he may again have to
use the knife; he attributes the whole trouble directly
to the wound caused by the cocoon. A Gippsland
bushman of my acquaintance suffered a similar experi-
ence ; first a hand, and later the arm, had to be
amputated. The puncture, he told me, was followed
immediately by excruciating pain.
* * * *
“Spenner”: Walking along an embank-
cent, I heard a low cry like the whimpering of a
child in the gully below. The note of appeal in the
call halted me abruptly. Before I could locate the
point from which the sound came it ceased. I had
moved on only a few paces when the cry was
repeated—shorter, sharper, more insistent. Looking
CHOIR PRACTICE.
LEADER: “Where ’e’s marked pp, ’e do mean ‘plenty power,’ and where ’e’s FF, ’ e do
mean ‘full foorce.’ Now, then, boays, wan, two, three, off!”
down, I saw a half-grown rabbit on a ledge of rock.
Something in its strained attitude held my attention.
Again the piteous, pleading cry. At the same in-
stant, from the undergrowth directly in front, a foot
or so of snake struck out. Widely distended jaws
grabbed the rabbit by the head as a dog might. I
decided to go to Bunny’s aid, but it was necessary
to make a detour of about 40yds. to reach the
ledge. When I arrived both victim and captor had
disappeared. Is it usual for a medium-sized snake
to deal so with a half-grown rabbit?
“Butten”: Australian heat records? I
can vouch for 127 deg. on Wellshot (C.Q.) in 1908,
and that on the shady side of the quarters. There
are others who could likewise swear to it—the
manager of Gundabline (N.S.W.) is one of them.
“Light H.”: “Yarran” (B. 2/4 / ’2 5 ) mentions the
heat in the Jordan Valley. As far as I am aware, I
had the only systematic Jordan records away from
the foothills, but unfortunately they were for August
only, and by then the proper hot period had passed.
My readings were taken hourly, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
inclusive, none being missed. The average shade
temperature for the 31 days was 107.6 deg. The
highest daily reading averaged 112.4 deg. Unfor-
tunately I have lost the details, so cannot quote the
top score. I also took night readings, which aver-
aged nearly 100 deg. at bedtime (variable). T
checked my thermometer with that of the field
hospital near Jericho.
“Tuart”: Is the Jordan country really more torrid
than Marble Bar, in tropical Westralia? I can’t
give the highest shade temperature at the Bar, but
in 1921-22, as the Official Yeah Book states, the
mercury went beyond 100 deg. on 103 consecutive
days. Mining has been pretty sick of recent years,
and perhaps there isn’t a Government school there
now, but when there was you couldn’t find a sturdier
lot of youngsters in the Commonwealth.
“Forebridge”: I can put in a fairly good entry for
consistent warmth. At Jidda, Arabia, in the sum-
mer of 1920, the thermometer on the bridge of our
gunboat never fell below 108 deg., day or night,
for three weeks. The pilgrimage to Mecca was in
progress at the time, and in three days 170 of the
Faithful died in the streets of Jidda. During the
same period we had only three cases of heat-stroke
on board, and only one of those was a white man.
The other two were Somalis, of whom we carried
but a dozen, though we had upwards of a hundred
Britishers. The dark-skinned races cannot compete
with Whites When the sun really shines. Inci-
dentally, the temperature of the sea-water rose to
101 deg.
* * * ■*
“Gelantipy”: These remarks about the
frightful things that happen to you if you sleep
out when the moon is full (B. 2/4/’25) remind me
of a narrow escape I had a few years ago. I was
walking from Jindabyne (N.S.W.) to Buchan (Vic.)
by the old track down Jacob’s Ladder, through
Suggan Boggan, and over the Black Mountain. When
night came I was miles away from anywhere, plug-
ging along the track down the Snowy River below
Jacob’s Ladder. Greatly daring, I slept on a sand-
bank beside the river, and though the moon was
full I did not have my face paralysed or even
twisted. There was an eclipse of the moon that
night.
* * * *
“Coolabah”: The caterpillar “James B.”
saw impaled was very likely put there by a shrike-
tit or a butcher-bird. The latter sometimes keeps
several dead-meat shops, but does not often impale
his victims. Still, I have known him to hang a long
“stick insect” on a briar-thorn. Although the
blue wren catches worms briskly, I have never known
him to store anything away. Jenny is generally at
hand, to help dispose of any surplus. I have found
tiny ladybirds hanging on thistle-thorns, and flies
also, but I don’t suspect Jacky Winter —it is not
his nature to put something aside for future use.
“Lake Eyre”: Concerning freshwater fish
in drought-time (B. 2/4/’25). Lake Hope, Cooper’s
Creek (S.A.), contains plenty of fish after a flood,
but unless another comes along in good time they
have only a limited span of life. First, the water
turns clear; then it gradually becomes salt and
bitter, whereupon the fish soon die out. As the
fluid evaporates they are left high and dry. I have
seen a circle of dead fish that would easily have
taped 15 miles.
“Munjong” : If “Buttenileu” (B. 9/4/’25)
does not insist on closing the kangaroo argument
on the “Bonzer soup” note, may I chip in? No
mention has been made of the grunting snort which
is given by a startled kangaroo. This is the real
danger signal, and is only given when the peril is
near. If there is sufficient time to do so the mob
will move off as silently as so many shadows, and
no snort or thump will be given. I have recently
been in country where kangaroo is very plentiful
and not often disturbed. I have repeatedly ridden
PROFESSIONAL CRITICISM.
ORCHARDIST : “ There’s a coupler peaches, Jed”
LOCAL BUTCHER: “Rib er beef an’ leg er lamb, I call ’em.”
or walked right on to them in the scrub, and, on
the strength of what I have seen, throw, in my vote
with those who say that the tail and feet thump
the ground almost simultaneously. The explana-
tion becomes, obvious to anyone watching a kan-
garoo turning in a leisurely tfashion. He uses the
tail as a third leg. To get off the mark “quick
feller.’’ as Binghi says, the ’roo leaves the ground
in his first (and, perhaps, second) jump at what
may be an awkward angle from the source of danger,
and uses his tail in turning as a pivot to help him
round, to keep his balance, and also to give impetus
to the initial jumps. Fighting kangaroos give
excellent illustrations of the use of the tail. A side-
step is always assisted by a whack of the tail on
the ground. The initial movements of a frightened
’roo in the bush are so lightning-quick that it is
hard to say, unless from constant observation, what
he does with either his tail or legs.
* * * •
“Cross C’s”: “W.J.C.” is surely in error
when he suggests (B. 26/2/’25) that northern abos.
have no idea of a Supreme Being. I have by me
an article by David Unaipon, a cultured, full-blooded
aboriginal of S.A., in which he tells of “sacred tra-.
ditions” being chanted and told at springtime
(“Parr-barrarie”) corroborees. Nebale is the ruler
of the heavens (“Wy-errie-war”). Mr. Unaipon’s
tribe—and all other S.A. tribes—came originally
from the North-West. On this point they are unani-
mous. This being so, it is unbelievable that they
brought all the religious belief south and left their
northern relatives entirely ignorant of ancient tribal
faith.
* * * *
“Northerner”: How’s this for a record in
building cattle-tailing yards ? Ernie Wilson erected
on the Merluna State Run, Gape York Peninsula
(Q.), one of 40 panels, with six-panel wing, in four
working days. Heavy posts and solid rails were used,
the rails (three) all round the yard being wire-
twitched on. All posts and rails were cut and barked
in the four days.
“Bouragi”: The Territory lately supplied
a story of aboriginal heroism which should make
the detractors of Black Brother’s courage take cover.
A crocodile seized his dog at a watering-place, in the
Katherine River, and the abo. master went in and
fought the giant lizard for his pet. All three dis-
appeared under water; when they came up again the
croc, still clung to the dog’s leg and the rescuer
to the crocodile’s back, pressing all the time his
thumbs into the brute’s eyes. After another dive
the dog appeared and swam ashore minus a leg.
Then the native popped up and landed unharmed.
It was the same crocodile that killed the racehorse
Comet at the same place a month or two ago, for
the scars then inflicted on it by the stallion’s hoofs
in the struggle were plainly visible.
* * * *
“Donko”: There has been a plague of
mice in the Goondhvindi (Q.) district as in so many
others. One settler, driven desperate, tried a bush-
man’s trap of which he had heard. It consists of a
treacle tin (71b. in this case), with a wire rod
passed through holes bored in the centre of each
end and fitted into holes grooved at the top sides of
a kerosene tin from which the lid has been removed.
For use the treacle tin is first rolled round in
melted fat; then sugar is sprinkled on the fat, which
soon sets hard. The kerosene tin is partly filled with
water, and placed on the ground, with which a
flat board communicates at a gentle slope. Your
mouse scampers up the board to get to the sugar
on the treacle tin ; this revolves, and down goes Mus
into the water. The Goondhvindi man caught 104
the first night.
“Herodot” : The dodge of catching mullet
with a crust of bread inside a pickle-bottle (B.
9/4/’25) is worked in another way on the Clarence
River (N.S.W.). There a kerosene tin with the
top cut away is used instead of the bottle, and a
large piece of raw meat is substituted for the bread.
Holes are cut in the bottom of the tin, and when
it is lowered a few feet into the water it is some-
times rushed, not only by mullet, but by other kinds
of fish as well. Then, with a quick jerk, the tin
is pulled up, and after being emptied of its catch is
lowered again for some more. In this manner I have
seen youngsters catch a couple of dozen big fish
inside an hour.
* * * #
“.Tacky Roo”: The limit wasn’t reached
when “Country Ped’s” four fat men in a car drove
50 sheep along a three-chain load (B. 9/4/’25). Last
year an Irishman and I and two tin Lizzies trans-
ported 20 comeback hoggets from Adaminaby to
Coolrington (N.S.W.), a distance of 32 miles. The
trip took an hour and a half. 8.5.—1 forgot to
mention that the jummies were inside the cars.
* * # #
“Nomad”: Westralian cockies know the
common rabbit-bandicoot by the name “dalgite,” and
are mostly inclined to consider it a nuisance wherever
it abounds. But some say that the more plentiful
it is the better. Years ago on the central wheat-
belt the dalgites disappeared most mysteriously. A
plague of mice followed. Now I’m not saying defi-
nitely that the dalgites kept the mice in check, but
for some time it has been suspected that the long-
eared animals preyed on the small rodents; cer-
tainlv the dalgites re-appeared, and were more
numerous than ever, as the mice died out. The
dalgite is an interesting chap all round. It lives
in burrows, and often makes its home with the
rabbit. Its tastes are carnivorous and herbivorous.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: Do swans like music? The
water-constables of the Torrens Lake, in the middle of
Adelaide, have charge of 100 or so of the birds, which
are yarded and fed whenever the lake is emptied out.
The officials report that this season’s nests have
been built chiefly in the most public and overlooked
part of the lake, close to a new floating dance
palace.
* * * *
“Fana”: Amongst practically all primi-
tive peoples there is an acute fear of the spirits of
the dead, and complicated precautions are taken to
ensure that these spirits shall not return to earth
and annoy the living. In some parts of New Guinea
it is the practice to pile heavy stones on a dead
man’s grave. Here, probably, is the origin of the
modern idea of erecting a tombstone over the resting-
place of the departed; and it is interesting to trace
the gradual decline of the custom from early ages
when gravestones were of enormous size to the pre-
sent day when they are in many cases no more than
a small block of stone at the head of the grave. The
habit of putting heavy weights to keep wild animals
from disinterring the corpse has also played a part
in the evolution of the tombstone, but only a very
small one, as may be seen from the fact that the
custom prevails in countries where wild animals do
not exist.

“I’m seeing red,” the bookie said,
And smote his bag in rage.
“To put it plain, they should be slain,
These blighters, Bruce and Page.”
So hard he thumped that straightway jumped
From out that bag so round
Perhaps a score of fives or more,
And fluttered to the ground.
Then on his knees to gather these,
Up spoke the lowly clerk:
“That’s surely so; you’ve said it, Mol
It is a flamin’ nark.
“Why, strike me blue, and then a few,
It fairly makes me boil
To think of how some poor, stiff cow
Is robbed of honest toil.”
The bookie’s eye was hard and dry;
Odd fivers quite a few
He nobly spurned, as slow he turned
And said: “Yes, that’s right, too.
“But what gets me is this, you see:
If Bruce his duty did,
Instead of one, wc might have spun
Six hundred thousand quid!”

ALTHOUGH the illustrations cannot effectively reveal
the real beauty and quality of the specially-selected
■ gems with which these pieces are set, nor the perfect
workmanship that has entered into their production, they
disclose two very distinctive designs. The diamond ear-
rings are flexible. The hip brooch, also in diamonds, is
representative of a favored design now being worn in
Paris. Both have been taken from a selection of exclusive
jewellery which contains many others just as beautiful
and attractive, while additional designs are continually
being added.

Anzac Day in Melbourne, grey, cheerless
and inclined to tears, was devoted to mem-
orial services and a march of returned men.
The procession recalled days of high tension
when the muffled beating of a drum told
the restless sleeper that brave men were pass-
ing to a great adventure. Almost, in dead
silence did these hundreds of returned men
go by. Where this Chatterer viewed the
concourse there was nought to break the
monotony of feet moving in rhythm save a
few bars of a military march played by a
passing band. The G.-G. was of the speakers
at. the service at the Exhibition on the morn-
ing, Lady Forster also being present.
In the afternoon her Ex. had a reception
at Federal Government House for the widows
and mothers of the R.A.N. and the A.1.F., at
which there was another short memorial ser-
vice, followed by tea and music. The ball-
room was well filled with women whose men-
folk had made the great sacrifice. Lady
Forster, in a black gown and millinery, with
a presentation basket of mignonette and
violets, extended the hand of welcome to all
her guests, who were given a sprig of rose-
mary along with the order of the service.
The G.-G., off to unveil a memorial at St.
Kihla, found time to look in and say a few
words of greeting. Her Ex. gave one of
those woman-to-woman chats which have
made her so popular, regretting this was
the last occasion she would meet them at
Government House on Anzac Day, though
her thoughts would surely be with them in
the succeeding years. A fine address by
Chaplain-Colonel McKenzie followed, and a
bevy of bonnie girls helped with the serving
of a very substantial afternoon tea. The
Creswell and Chauvel dames were of the
gathering, and Mrs. Victor Selllieim, Miss
Alice Wilcox and Theophilus Roberts were
responsible for the music.
The Galli-Curci boom continues reverber-
ating loud enough to drown any defects in
the diva’s stock-in-trade. On Saturday night
the flexible voice seemed to be suffering
from tiredness and the Melbourne weather;
but a crowded house lavished applause and
garden stuff upon its owner, who waved her
lace hanky in response. Her apparel, which
started as a lampshade and passed at the
back into an umbrella-shaped train, was silk
of dull blue ground, upon which wandered
huge pink roses, gold-leaved and stalked,
with edgings of emerald sequins and hang-
ings of glittering fringe. A sash of royal
blue, centre-tracked with diamertte, faced
the audience when the lady right-about-
turned to sing an encore number to the gal-
leryites upon the platform. A red lacquer
comb rose above her sleek black locks. The
singer did her usual, prance from the dress-
ing-room to the stage (and back) like the
pretty lady of the circus about to leap upon
her galloping, bare-backed steed: one can
almost see her husband Homer Samuels as
a decorative ringmaster.
“Skittles,” John O’Hara’s new pastime at
the Athenaeum, is the other side of the
medallion to “Spring Cleaning.” It’s the sort
of play to take a prospective mid-Victorian
mother-in-law to —nice, pretty, lofty and
built on illusions that have got somewhat
tarnished since Queen Anne’s day. The
stage was a showground booth of horticul-
tural emblems when John stepped forth to
loose the usual platitudes; followed by Mag-
gie Jarvis, a bonnie Skittles, and the blase
Martin Walker. Emma Temple, th/e grand
dame of the piece, smiled broadly in; a dash-
ing cream cloth suit, with out-size gaunt-
let cuffs, trimmings of magpie satin bands
and becoming black millinery.
Melbourne’s smartest club, the Alexandra,
bloomed with the flowers and foliage of
autumn when Joyce Jennings was given a
pre-nuptial tea by her prospective mother-
in-law. Mrs. Willie Barrett. The pretty
damsel, who should be Mrs. Russell Barrett
when these lines are printed, was in frock-
ing of two tones of brown with headpiece
ditto. The hostess brightened sable with a
dash of Oriental embroidery; her millinery
was black. Sheila Barrett had some
leopard skin upon her beige suit, and wore a
hat of tan felt; sister Nancy, all in brown,
cheered it with a touch of red. Mrs. Ivo
Whitton, the bride-elect’s sister, gave a hand
in entertaining the company, which included
the Robinson, Miller and Allen ladies, and
Mrs. Hall-Thompson. Madame Harris and
Signor Bartolini warbled between the tea
and chatter.
The hop engineered by six members of the
Austral Salon at headquarters one night
last week was brilliantly successful. 1-
was the first of a series to help
foot the furnishing bill, for when fare
came last year the club had no insurance
policy to exchange for the ashes. Bottle-
brush greenery and autumn leaves made
effective setting for fascinating frocks. The
promoting sextette included. May Rimming-
ton, a good-looker draped in turquoise-blue
crepe satin ; Mrs. Jim Angus, in black char-
mante; Mrs. J. L. Stein glistening in black
jet and diamente; Mrs. Hotchkiss, whose
exquisite gown was crystal-embroidered to
the waistline and black-beaded the rest of
the way; Mrs. R. Fitcher in lines of opales-
cent sequins and beaded lloral designs; and
Alice Richardson in flame satin. Secretary
Mrs. Quinnell was in draperies of mauve
and gold shot baronet satin. And a very
pretty girleen was Dorothy Palliser, green-
leaf crowned and green frocked.
The Eye and Ear Hospital appeal gathered
the takings of a tea-jazz at Carlyon's one
afternoon last week. Rain in a deluge and
a fierce, cold wind propelled patrons from
their motor-cars into tlie ballroom. Theat-
rical stars were listed as chief attractions,
but Maud Fane, billed as hostess, and host
Alfred Frith were the only heroes who
appeared out of the storm. Maud twinkled
in an orange-lined frock beneath si squirrel
fur coat and millinery of blsick. Georges
Capel and dancing partner Molly Kensella
tripped some entrancing measures about a
ballroom hung with golden draperies and
glow-worm lights. Frocking was sombre,
black satin and fringe approaching almost a
uniform, and the cheeriest note that was
struck outside Jimmy Bachelder’s band was
the clierry-hued raiment which peeped from
out a dark coat worn by one of the Henncssy
trio. Young folk from “Jessie ..Tames’ and
“Primrose” companies danced in the good
cause. Society’s representatives included the
Hennessy dame, Mrs. Frank Faulkner, Mrs.
Warburton, Mrs. Grantley Sheldon and Mrs.
Jack Dunstan.
St. John’s, Clifton Hill, housed the wedding
of Nursing-sister Zita Carroll and P. F.
O’Shaughnessy, whose pasture lands slope to
the Clarence* River and whose block of
fashionable flats outstare the Pacific at
Manly. The bride was lately Superintendent
at St. Vincent’s Hospital, Toowoomba (Q.),
and St. Joseph’s, Auburn (N.S.W,). She
combines brilliant musical talents with those
of ministering angel. After gaining the
A.L.C.M. at the Catholic Ladies’ College
here, she guided young Australia in note and
legato at her Alma Mater, and later at the
Bethlehem Ladies’ College in Sydney. For-
saking music for nursing, she trained at St.
Vincent’s. Melbourne. The wedding cere-
mony is the happy ending to an old romance.

From .Jo'burg. on a trip to London via
“the East,” comes Mrs. Beatrice Colby, M.A.,
and her son, Phil Manners, who goes to
study for the Bar at Cambridge after a
brilliant scholastic career. Something new
in blue-stockings is Mrs. Colby, who in
spite of a classical tripos is a director of
two asbestos mining cos. She plays a big
part in women’s movements in S’Africa,
where in civic affairs the ladies can “put it
over” the National Council of Women or any
such body in Australia. The sex got busy some
14 years ago as an emergency committee to
deal with abuses. A proper fever hospital,
certified nurses only in nursing homes, and
adequate pensions for women teachers were
first reforms. Their war memorial took
the practical form of a children’s hospital,
costing £30,000. Exploitation of child labor
is almost unknown on the Rand, and the
credit must be handed the ladies, for
the Juveniles Advisory Board, now a statu-
tory body, takes a lively interest in every boy
and girl from the time they leave school
until they are 18. The Kaffir “boy,” who is on
a half-yearly contract and is re-registered by
the householder every month at a cost of 25.,
Is. of which goes to the hospitals, solves very
comfortably the servant question.
The coming of “Spring Cleaning” and
“The Masquerader” is likely to cause the
return to favor of that feminine addition
which began its career as a dressing-gown,
developed into a tea-gown, and now bears
the title of rest-garment or neglige. Pauline
Frederick’s robe in the fh’st-mentioned piece,
which suggests a bit of grassy lawn jazzing
through a bed of Iceland poppies, wakened
the longing, and now Ailsa Grahame in the
Bates Post offering appears in nude colored
and fetching floats of accordeon-pleated
georgette, with pink roses scattered over
them, and mammoth tassels dangling from
her plump shoulders. The spread of the
complaint across the footlights is momentarily
expected.
Now fleeting overseas in the Ormuz, for
a year's tour abroad, is Noel, the daughter of
the Gordon Lyon pair, of Heidelberg. The
maiden, who is a dashing horsewoman, was
handed several farewell plates of sandwiches.

when war
came to Italy
joined the

and at one
period was director of a block of military

he lias laid aside pestle and mortar and
followed the thorny path of teacher and
artist.
The surgeon Symes’ roof-tree at Kew burst
into leaf and bloom the other evening for the
delectation of the younger set. Glowing
fires flamed a cheery welcome, for it was
dirty weather. Alyson and sister Theo were
hostesses; the Syme dame, who glittered in
black, was merely mother. Mauve frock-
ing, with a border of velvet flowers, was
favored by the senior daughter, and Theo
jazzed in white, with embroidery in crimson
and dull gold, fore and aft. Mrs. Willie
Godfrey, robed in black brocade, kept the
chatelaine of Chesterfield company, the
knight having started on a visit to the
Apple Isle.
Jean Barrkman, of Melbourne, made her
covenant with Marcus Marks, of Sydney, at
the Bourke-street synagogue. The bride was
once connected with the business world of
Jo’burg, and the honeymoon includes a re-
turn trip to Victoria Falls. White marocain
and a drape of rare old French blonde lace,
lent by Mrs. Beatrice Colby, of S’Africa,
was her array. Molly Phillips, back from
England and ’Murka, bridesmaided a
Bond-street purchase of cyclamen crepe
satin with attachment of cretonne and gold
lace; and Lisbeth Casper also attended aunty
in a frock of the same hues, star-sprinkled.
After-rejoicings were at 9 Darling-street.
Bride’s mother was in black velvet-embossed
georgette; and Mrs. John Marks (Marcus
is her eldest son) wore draperies of black
brocade and cloth of silvex 1 . Dainty hand-
kerchiefs and silken hosiery were the offer-
ings of the guests at a tea in honor of the
bride given at Malvern by Mrs. A. Phillips
and her girls, Dr. Isabel and Milly, during
the week.
Iceland poppies made radiance at the
Oriental on Thursday afternoon, when folk
played bridge or listened between tea and
cakes to the artists Eileen Castles had gath-
ered for the benefit of the Eye and Ear Hos-
pital appeal. Aiders and abettors in the
big roll-up were Mrs. Peter Lynch, whose
gowning was black ottoman silk with mil-
linery decked with fawn -plumage ; and Mrs.
M. Dynon, who was in tones of cinnamon
and chocolate. Winter having come last
week, most patrons were armored to the
shingle line with fur, the wrappings being
quite wonderful. Mrs. W. M. Robins was
in fascinating raiment jacquered in blue
and black, and the Tallis dame was a study
in brown. Eileen Castles, black-hatted and
grey-frocked, had in her musical flock Vera
Bedford, Sheila Bruen, Alice Madigan, Leslie
Barklam, Kingsley Parkes, Russell Callow
and Milton Parkes.
The purchase by the Herald of the Sun
(or perhaps it was the sale of the Sun to
the Herald) was not the only business coup
of the week. Myer’s, Ltd., has managed at
last to buy out Stephens and Son. For a
long time the Stephens family was obstinate,
but the bigger concern was persistent, and
went a long way toward attaining its goal
when it acquired the Robertson and Moffa(
property. Now Myer’s will have the Eliza-
beth-street post office (formerly the G.P.0.)
as its western boundary. Its northern front
is Lonsdale-street, opposite the Melbourne
Hospital.
The women tennis players, captained by
Mrs. R. R. Harper, who are going to try
their luck against the champions of Europe,
held ribbons with many friends when the
Ormuz moved off the other day. Mrs. Red-
mond Barry will, as manager, mother the
party. After carrying all before them in the
Cold Country, they will try to gather a few
laurel leaves in the land of the Stars and
Stripes, on their homeward way.
The Frank Bevans’ Bessie “came out” to
the usual accompaniments under the family
roof-tree the other evening. Mamma, who
extended the glad hand to many young folk,
wore black satin sparkling with .jet; and
Bessie was charming in blue sprinkled with
crystal beads.
Mr. and Mrs. David Hopkins, now ’moon-
ing in the Harbor City, were made one in
this capital. The feasting, chiefly attended
by relatives, was at Menzies’. The bride,
Adeline Twomey who was, hails from Lan-
gulac, Penshurst, and was a study in beige
from hat to gown of georgette and lace,
broken by a sheaf of pink roses, and a dash
of color in her millinery.
As its oldest inhabitant, David Watters ton,
a retired editor of the Australasian, is
having his portrait by Longstaff hung at
the Yorrick Club. The same painter is also
commissioned to immortalise the good looks
of our G.-G. for the Queen’s Hall in the
Federal Parliament buildings. Dr. T. P.
Mclnerney, late warden of the University,
is another notable who will undergo the
spectrum analysis of the busy painter’s
brush.
When the appeal for the Eye and Ear
Hospital is closed the man in the street will
be allowed to save up his threepences—until
July 1, when he will be requested to part
up again for that most deserving of insti-
tutions, St. Vincent’s Hospital. During the
following half-year’s pleading for cash the
Sisters of Charity hope to raise £lOO,OOO to
enable them to complete the front facing Vic-
toria-parade, and so cross the T which is
the architectural form of their public build-
ing. Members of St. Vincent’s Linen League
intend holding their f§te days at Charnwood
early in May.
Stella Wilson, of the fine soprano notes,
has been doing great things in America.
With the De Feo Grand Opera Co. she has
stirred emotional Montreal in the leading
role of “La Tosca.” Vi,ce-royalty and
10,000 people roared their approval at the
opening performance, and the press searched
for adjectives to describe the Melbourne
girl’s triumph as singer and actress.
Mr. and Mrs. John Tait are the next of the
clan to go to London. Brother Charles,
whose interests lie in Allan’s music ware-
house, departed a week or so ago for the
Great Fog.
A line or two from Adelaide:—
Women are clustering, like bees about a chrysan-
themum-bed, around the household displays at the
All-Australian Exhibition. There can be seen rooms
furnished with appliances beyond dreams of avarice
of 20 years ago; and all amazingly moderate in
price. Everything, from knitted frocks to porcelain
baths, is of local manufacture, and mannequins
parade locally-made silk stockings.
Easter visitors to Sydney were the S. H. Skippers
—she was Kathleen Beach, of the Harbor city, and
he is the president and was the founder of the
Commonwealth Club in Adelaide, which was the
first salad-and-trifie-CMm-talk affair in Australia. The
originator’s idea was to have a Commonwealth
Club in every capital city, but Sydney spoilt that
idea by calling hers the Millions Club.
A contract has been let for the Teachers’ Training
College. The students have latterly been uncom-
fortably housed in the old military barracks behind
the Public Library; they will have to move only
a few yards—to the site of the former Destitute
Asylum (all the residents of that have been re-
moved to a pleasant Old Folks’ Home on the hill-
slopes at Magill). The new building is to cost
£30,000, and be ready towards the end of 1926.
It will be in between Government House, the Museum
and the University.
The Palais Royal was comfortably filled on Friday
when ’Varsity students and their friends jazzed in
aid of the inter-University boatraee expenses. Miss
Deslandes, Miss T. Davies and Miss Kriehauff deco-
rated the show and helped it on.
For the third year in succession St. Peter’s tore
(he inter-collegiate sports cup from the striving
hands of Prince Alfred’s. Justice Poole, our acting
vice-royalty, superintended the exchange, and thou-
sands of flappers cheered the victors.
To the 240 lawyers practising in this State two
more are shortly to be added. Not that the number
is significant, but they happen to be skirted, and
the}' are the followers-on of four other female plead-
ers, and the vanguard of the Law Society doesn’t
know how many more. The question whether women
should be admitted to the Bar was the subject
of a controversy at the Law Students’ Debating
Society the other evening, but it isn’t expected that
the result of this will have any serious consequences.
Miss E. L. Holmes and Miss T. E. Bleby are the two
ladies who caused the pother.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
The tenth anniversary of Anzac was a
moody day—sunny in the morning, grey m
the afternoon, drizzling at night. Not a
happy day—it seemed as though as the hours
wore on its memories greyed and made
pallid the banner of its glory. At an early
hour Sydney streets had been thronged again
with a leaf-brown army. Not a very smart
or debonair army—some of its soldiers
limped, swung themselves on crutches or
wore a pathetic sleeve. But no matter how
sick the face, how dragging the limb, each
hurried to keep a rendezvous with his dead
comrades. The bells of St. Andrew’s and
St. Mary’s called their flocks to pray for the
dead; in the Town Hall Colonel Orames, of
the Salvation Army, delivered the address;
in suburban parks and churches the paean of
glory with its undertone of tears rose in
waves that swept in floodtide through the
ether till it broke surging and imploring
against the eternal shore. The Town Hall
was brave with banners. Red and green,
violet and yellow, the colors flamed along
the galleries, and here and there hung one
as blue as that HCgean Sea that knows how
heroes fight and die. There was not a seat
vacant; the balconies and stage were tier
upon tier of faces, the body of the hall a sea
of suppressed emotion. Side by side sat
widows and mothers and sisters: an Anzac
daddy squeezed tight his small lad’s hand
and found the hymns on the programme for
him; across the aisle an Anzac’s orphan
patted his mother’s shabby glove and found
the hymns on the programme for her. Here
and there a lonely old lady (like one’s mental
picture of Mother Machree), her white hair
surmounted by an old-fashioned bonnet,
looked after herself. A soldier On crutches
stopped beside an empty aisle seat. “Am
I butting in ?” he asked. He hadn’t waited
to ask that ton years ago. War-nurses and
blinded and limbless men ironically enough
wore sprigs of rosemary—and rosemary’s for
remembrance. On the platform his Ex. the
Viking sat with immovable face living over
again Heaven knows what bit of Hell in
the North Sea. About him were A.I.F.
generals and colonels with mask-like faces and
an atmosphere electric with memories that
clutched the throat when the Last Post was
sounded.
The Swan of Avon had a birthday last
week, and the Players and the Shakspearc
Society pooled their histrionic resources and
presented “The Merchant” at the Con. Eric
Howell was the producer, and Eric is clever
enough to have felt at some stages of the
evening that “The Merchant” sounded like
the Bard’s swan-song rather than a monu-
ment to his reputation. The play was pre-
sented as closely to Elizabethan stage-
standards as our knowledge of the times
allows, and Eric Howell, as the billposter
who tacked up notices on different parts of
the stage (“A Street in Venice,” “Shylock’s
House,” etc.), was equally marvellous in his
make up and solemnity. Grammar Master
and Red Page enthusiast Francis Jackson
made a blood-curdling Shylock; Portia was
monotonous even in the casket-guessing com-
petition; but John Gould made Antonio live
again. Another laurel-winner was James
Hatton as Gobbo. And a handbill printed
after the manner of Master Shakspeare when
he was his own publicity-manager deserves a
mention.
The Elsa Stralia cabaret for St. Mar-
garet’s will drop another ducat or two into
its coffers. The Ambassadors was again
packed to the boundaries of the palm court,
and dancing was of the small mind-your-step
variety. To make up for the absence of foot-
action, the bodies of many of the dancers
wriggled continuously. It brought to mind
Foch’s famous comment on his first visit to
a London night club. This Letter mayn't
say it in English, and can’t write it in
French. But, no doubt, you remember it.
Anyway, Mrs. W. D. Langton, the hospital’s
president Donald Bourke, Mrs. Stewart Daw-
son in a smart white kasha suit and a duck
of a white felt hat, and Sister Kerven must
have felt very joyous over the big roll-up. The
guest, who wore a black ospreyed hat above
beautiful furs, brought Mrs. Slapoffski and
brother Hugo Fischer in her train. But the
sight that left the room breathless was the
Ben Fuller lady’s coat. It was fashioned
of Russian sable to the hips and thence to
below the knees was a fringe of narrow
brown braid—rather like tossing seaweed
when the lady got into motion.
The Rawson Institute looked rather un-
certain of itself on the afternoon of
Nora Knox's marriage—rather like the
mother who, seeing her girl a bride, tries
to make herself believe she is not losing a
daughter but is gaining a son. Nora is the
youngest daughter of Mrs. Tom Knox, of
Bellevue Hill, and that lady and her
daughter are strenuous supporters of the
Seamen’s Mission. Nora had chosen All
Saints’ at Woollahra as the scene of her
wedding to Ernest Whistler (with those
names he might quite easily have taken the
wrong turning and become a trombone-
player) Street, the youngest son of the
State’s Chief Justice, and the church was
duly decorated with afternoon sunshine,
white roses, feathery chrysanthemums and
battalions of Knoxes. The dark-haired
bride floated up the aisle on brother’s arm
in ivory panne and silver lace reminiscent
of delicious sugar-coated confections, an
effect that was further enhanced by a cloud
of shell-pink tulle that swayed airily from
its orange-blossom moorings. An armful of
pale-pink gladioli and white roses was a
further accessory. Margaret Knox and
Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow ’maided in
frothy pinks' and silvers, and two small
nieces of the ’groom, Philippa and Belinda
Street, further made the way of the prin-
cipals straight. Canon Langley and Canon
Beck saw to it that the pair were truly and
sufficiently married. Dr. Tom Street was
best man. The reception at Leura, the
bride’s home, was notable for its brilliant
speeches; even the bridegroom, owing, it was
alleged, to his proficiency in crossword
puzzles, wove a neat garland of words,
although he did pretend to be nervous of
speaking before two Chief Justices —-the
Federal Chief Justice Adrian Knoxes were
of the cake-eaters. In fact, it would be hard
to say what leading legal light of Sydney was
absent.
Stewart Dawson had a wedding in the
family the other night, and the Dawson roof-
tree at Pbtts Point was deserted, for every-
body was in St. Jude’s at Randwick watch-
ing eldest son Percy thrust a ring, his heart
and his possessions on Rita Barnett. Canon
Cakebread heard the vows and pronounced
the judgment, while the bride shimmered in
cloth of silver misted over by a veil of old
Limerick lace which frothed to the very hem
of the wedding frock. The entire crop of
an orchid house glowed in her white bouquet,
and sister Jean ’maided in frocking that
trembled from primrose to gold. Two tiny
girls looking like French dolls added to the
pictorial effect. Bruce Venn-Browne best-
manned, and the cake was cut at the Ambas-
sadors. And if Constable Chuck had been
there the entire party would have cut
him, too.
Here is a May Moore picture of Rose
Scott, perhaps the most wonderful woman
Australia has produced. Last week, the
grand old lady met the only oppo-
nent who has ever vanquished her, and
her home in Jersey-road, Woollahra will
known her no more. Bred of the Bush
in the long ago. Rose brought youth and good
looks, a magnificent brain and a heart just
as magnificent to the city, and then with a
gallantry that time and hope-deferred were
powerless to defeat she set up her standard
in the cause of Womanhood. It was not the
popular thing in the days of her middle age
for a woman openly to declare herself a suf-
fragist, and there were not wanting those
who were
audibly “sur-
prised at Rose
Scott wasting
her looks and
her charm” in
such a Cause.
However, she
was the living
torch of the
Women’s Suf-
frage League
for 11 years—
it was exactly
11 years from
the day of the
League’s foun-
dation to the
enfranchise-
ment of the
women of N. S.
Wales. But
not only did
Rose Scott help
to get votes for
women : she opened up for them a hundred
and one avenues to health and happiness.
The Factories Act, the appointment of women
inspectors, the better treatment of women
prisoners, the Early Closing Act, the Women’s
Legal Status Act, the Prisoners’ Aid Asso-
ciation —these were but a few of the social
reforms Miss Scott gave her life’ to. Even in
1921, when she resigned the international
secretaryship of the National Council of
Women and the Council made her a presen-
tation, her thoughts were of others. With
the cheque she founded a prize for a Woman
Law Student at Sydney University. Later
in 1922, when the public of Sydney wished to
honor her and asked her to allow John Long-
staff to paint her portrait, she agreed on
condition she was allowed to give the paint-
ing to the Art Gallery; and in the gallery
she lives again, the keen yet kindly eyes
unfilmed by age. Even apart from her
public life Rose Scott was certainly the
beloved woman of her time; and in the old
days Lynton was more like a political and
artistic salon than a suburban home. Hos-
pitable up to the end, when Miss Scott found
herself too sick a woman to give her usual
Christmas-party she had a list of her old
friends brought to her, and to each she sent
out a gift bought specially to suit the
receiver.
Roland Ward was not in the cast of “The
Second Mrs. Tanqueray” at the Criterion
on Saturday. He was sitting in the d.-c.
with the first Mrs. Ward, who until April
20 was Miss Peggy Willoughby and came
to Australia recently to dance for William-
son’s. Dion Boucicault gave the youthful
bride with the raven shingle away at St.
John’s, Darlinghurst.
St. Mark’s housed another wedding during
the week-end. when life-rivets were slipped
on Marcia Williamson, of Darlinghurst, and
Dr. John Maude (he was one time of
Orange). There were three bridesmaids,
two ’groomsmen, one best man, 200 guests
and an after-wedding party at the Rose Bay
Golf Club. That gives you an idea of the
glitter of the occasion.
One day when sky-pilot Edgar Percival
came to earth, May Moore lured him before
li e r camera,
and this is
the result.
The capable
and careful
knight of the
air had his
training in the
best ether of
all above
t h e A.I.F.
trenches; and
here he won
his captaincy.
Nowadays he
i s Sydney’s
only freelance
of the sky, and
plies his own
little air-’bus
for hire: joy
ride or business
vent ur e or
publicity
stunt, he’ll
have a fly at it. He comes from the Rich-
mond district, where the good pastures and
the aerodrome are, and he has a sister who
is nearly as good an aviator as he is.
Brilliant pianist Phyllis Walls tucked
her Woolley scholarship about her last week
(and very comforting she must have found
it in the cold blast), and left by the .Jervis
Bay for London and the Academy. A day
or two earlier the clever youngster had been
given quite a send-off at the Town Hall.
Gaud Mayor Stokes and his Mayoress cousin,
Cecilia Walsh, had run the vacuum over the
civic reception-rooms and banked them with
crimson salvia and palms for the little
cheerio; and after the teacups had been
bustled into the purlieus, and the last note
of music had died on the air. Dr. Fallon
handed Phyllis a cheque for £lOO from the
many friends who admire her.
Duncan Macdougall's studio at 11 Rowe-
street was sorely put to it last week to sup-
ply seating accommodation for all who
wished to see the opening of the Playbox
season. The sight of the crowded room,
into which more and more twos and threes
were wedging, kept bringing to mind the old
rhyme: “And if you have not chairs
enough to seat a ladies’ school, You find that
one must do without or use the music stool.’’
It was comprehensive, that audience ; authors
and poets and just newspaper people; car-
penters, architects and a sprinkling of ama-
teur players. The studio had been turned
into a real theatre, with stage scenery
painted by Erik Langker and a spotlight box.
The two plays produced were a one-acter,
“Overtones,” by Alice Gerstenberg. and An-
atole France’s “Pushcart Vendor.” “Over-
tones” proved a curious little scene between
four women —two women of culture (Doro-
thea Mackellar and Lorraine Weldon) and
two primitives (Carrie Tennant and Judy
Watson). In “The Pushcart Vendor” Dun-
dan Macdougall by a miracle introduced a
cast of 18 on the pocket-handkerchief stage.
He himself gave a touching and realistic
performance as Crainquebille, the unfortu-
nate old inarticulate of Paris’s submerged
tenth.
Next Thursday evening the Town Hall will
ring with the splendor of Verdi’s Requiem.
The Philharmonics are presenting the great
work, in which beauty and solemnity walk
hand in hand. Veteran Joseph Bradley will
conduct.
Just dropped in, by way of South Africa
and Maorijand, Dorothea Vincent, a bright
English pianist, with an armful of modern
works, some of them quite new to Australia.
Dorothea’s set in London includes such as
Goossens, Moeran, Bax and the little group
of English music-writers who are proving
that it isn’t necessary to be born on the
Continent to be a composer. An interesting
work of her season in the Adyar Hall will
be a Goossens sonata, the violin being bowed
on the occasion by Bobrinsky.
Princess Alice, the largest elephant in
Wirths’ Circus, is doing her bit to help the
T.B. appeal. Every ticket-holder who goes
to the benefit performance of the circus on
April 30 will be entitled to a free guess at
the lady’s weight. To the correct guesser or
mostly nearly correct guesser of her avoirdu-
pois, trunk, hoof and hide, H. R. Highness
will pass a gold wristlet watch given by
Fairfax and Roberts.
Arthur Streeton is trying to gather par-
ticulars of his pictures scattered over Aus-
tralia, and would be glad if collectors would
send him size and title of the works they
hold, with date if that is visible. The artist
wants to publish a catalogue which will be
an accurate record of his works from 1884
to the present day. His address is Fairlie
House, Anderson-street, South Yarra (Vic.).
Dr. Charles MacLaurin was iirobably a
victim of whooping-cough: he had this
“infantile” trouble a few weeks ago,
and, though he believed he had quite
recovered, it evidently left him with
a strained heart. He was the eldest
son of Normand MacLaurin, for so
many years Chancellor of Sydney Univer-
sity—a father whom the son held almost in
veneration. Dr. Charles left a widow and
a daughter, the latter also a Sydney graduate,
lately married, and now living at Schenec-
tady, the big engineering centre outside New
York. The widow is an Edinburgh lady;
and there is a great sympathy with her in
her loneliness and sorrow.
Mrs. Kilgour, whose husband was an early
manager of Dalgetys, died the other week
at Roseville. In the old days the Kilgours
lived at Redleaf, Double Bay, and were
tremendously well known and popular in
Sydney. Mrs. Kilgour was Miss Maud Inge-
low, a sister of poetess Jean.

The Bard’s anniversary saw “The Merchant of
Venice” demanding his pound of flesh at His

and “walked like Dorothy Cumming,” which is
another way of saying she had grace.
Cremorne had a big farewell night; some devotees
remaining to clap the Diggers till half-past twelve.
Pat Hanna wandered round in the pyjamas he wore
in the last act, and presumably went to bed in them.
A silver cigarette-case and a handbag for his wife

Barcaldine district is interested in the announce-
ment that Olive Dalzell, once of Dalgi station and
now of Darling Point, Sydney, has accepted the

Mrs. Jack Chandler served tea at Lennon's to a
century of guests for Margaret Ross-Munro, who
will be married this week. Pink and mauve posies
were handed to each guest, and the wintergarden
and ballroom were filled with palms and roses.
Mrs. Tom Ryan played hostess for the opening
of the Wintergarden CafS. Peacock blue and rose
pink, with brown basket vases of marigolds and
nasturtiums, was the color scheme.
The president of the Brisbane Club cast wide
the doors and welcomed in a large crowd, amongst
whom were Commander Ryan and officers of the
Concord. The President (Dr. Halford) unveiled a
picture of past-president Isaacs, and Mr. Isaacs
cheerfully fended the verbal bouquets. Mrs. Hal-
ford wore black georgette and carried a presentation
bunch of red roses. Norah Halford was in ivory.
Mrs. E. It. Isaacs was bright in moonlight and
flame. Black and gold sheathed Mrs. Eric Anning,
and Mrs. P. J. Symes wore powder blue.
There was dancing and a merry dinner in the
Royal Golf Club the other evening. Aileen and
Clover Thompson and pretty Jean Gross were
amongst the jazzers, plus a boatload from the Con-
cord. Charlie Chauvel looked in before going west
to photograph Strawberry for his first Australian
picture, “The Moth of Moonbi.”
Dorothy Bloeksidge promised to love, honor, etc.

The Southern division of the Queensland Country
Women’s Association held its annual meeting in
Toowoomba last week, and over 100 delegates at-
tended. Among the visitors were Mrs. Studdy,
president of the N.S.W. Association, and Mrs. Francis,
of Westralia ; and Mrs. A. Crowther (Townsville), and
Mrs. Black (Pajango station) came down from the
North to listen to the fine record of work accom-
plished during the year. The Southern division now
has 5000 on its roll, and in the last 12 months
has helped hospitals and ambulances, provided homes
at the seaside and rest rooms in remote country
towns, and offered a helping hand to the Bush Nursing
Association and the Bush Book Club. Mrs. Fairfax
is its soul as well as its president.
A visiting show the other night advertised at
Toowoomba “the sparkling French piece, La Belle
Paquita.” The lads of the village, well pomaded,
arrived in full force, to discover with disgust that
it was a playlet, not a lady.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Beauford ran a pretty good race in the
All-Aged Stakes at Randwick, in which Heroic dis-
tinguished himself by getting left at the post. For
six furlongs the old fellow, who was not in the
market, was fighting with Whittier for the lead,
and at the finish he was almost on terms with The
Night: Patrol and within three lengths of The Hawk.
The Beau Soult —-Blueford brown lias been galloping
well since, and with lOst. 4lb. he will have, to be
considered for the Denman Stakes, six furlongs, at
Randwick on Saturday, unless it is decided to start
him in the City Tattersall’s Cup, 11 furlongs, in
which he has 9st. 71b. Another veteran who has
been showing good track form is Duke Isinglass,
who has Bst. 9lb. in the Denman Stakes —a luxurious
weight if the Duke were at his best. There are
some dangerous candidates lower down the list, such
as Absurdum (Bst. 31b.), Tressie (7st. 121 b.), Fair
Rosaleen (7st. 31b.), Pardex (7st. 21b.), Foxy (7st.),
and the Westralian mare Jolly Handsome (6st. 121 b.)
—-a very nice bit of stuff —but Beauford or Duke
Isinglass may do it. Another Westralian in Feather-
nest may take out the Cup, unless Lady Valais (7st.
101 b.) comes to light. Feathernest was substantially
backed for the A.J.C. Final Handicap, won by Stony,
and was running on at the finish after getting a
rough passage. Seven-stone eleven is not much of
a weight for a horse that finished a very close
fourth in the Metropolitan, giving Polycletan 81b.,
and was runner up to Purser, with 7st. 131 b., in the
Caulfield Cup, in addition to being third in Lily-
pond’s Perth Cup, conceding the winner 91b.
“Cobber" : Two of those fine-looking Sar-
chedon yearlings which brought such great prices in
Sydney at Faster died within a week of the sale.
It recalls an experience of which the late Cunliffe-
Owen told us when our Ninth Battery drivers visited
bis stud in 1915. This prominent English owner had
picked out a couple of Sheen colts that were to be
offered at the Newmarket sales, but bis motor-car
broke down as he was on his way to bid for them.
He persuaded a near-by tenant-farmer to drive him
to the sales. They arrived just as the Sheens were
being auctioned. Cunliffe-Owen secured his two
fancies at something like 6000 guineas for the pair.
When the succeeding lot was put up the tenant-farmer
bid 200 guineas, not dreaming that it would be taken,
but, no one else spoke, and down dropped the hammer.
One of the Cunliffe-Owen colts was crippled going
home; the other died within the week. The 200-
guineas lot became Ask Papa (Sheen —Pop the
Question), winner of many rich English handicaps.

“Hasen” : In Melbourne the recognised
authority' for starting-price odds is the Argus. This
journal sometimes disagrees with others in its quota-
tions, perhaps because its responsibility makes it more
careful, but the disagreement is rarely on the side of the
punter. The latest case is that of Gay Serenader,
winner of the Albury (N.S.W.) Gold Cup. In the
Sun and the Age the starting-prices given were 6 to 1
Warwickshire, 7 to 1 Gay Serenader and Textile.
In the Argus’s detailed account of the meeting it is
stated that “Gay Serenader, if he had not failed at.
Caulfield on Saturday would, no doubt, have started
a short-priced favorite: as it was the favorite was
Warwickshire.” But. later on the same page pre-
sumably the same reporter quotes the odds (which
automatically become official) as “6 to 1 each against
Gay Serenader and Warwickshire.” An unfortunate
juxtaposition of statements which would be the
better for some explanation. I don’t like heaving a
brick at the scribe in these matters; I suppose he is
largely at the mercy of the bookmakers, whose
death-knock quotes, as given to him after the race,
he averages as best he can. But it would be more
satisfactory to punters if the club itself fixed the
prices after examining its copies of the bookmakers’
sheets. More satisfactory still if they' were authorised
to install straightout totalisators, in which case the
s.p. backer could demand tote odds and no limit,
or no bet.
“ Jacky Roo”: In May Sydney will pro-
bably witness the best polo tournament in the
history of the game in Australia, for then will
representatives of four States and Maoriland compete
for a cup donated by Anthony Hordern and R. T.
Melrose, M.L.C., of S.A. The next step, of course,
will be to send a team to the Cold Country, or,
cheaper still, to invite the Hurlingham autocrats
to send one out here. From what I saw in England
the Aussies would be hopelessly outmatched in
ponies; but I fancy that our individual players would
more than hold their own. If an English team
came out the matches might be opened to the
general public instead of being confined to the
families of the wealthy people who can afford to
play the game. Why not, anyway? The annual
Dudley Cup tournaments in Sydney always strike
me as being Sydney’s great week of snobbishness.

Owing to the flinty nature of the going
the N.S.W. Coursing Association’s Derby and Oaks
meeting at Rooty Hill developed into an endurance
match. The hare is at home on all sorts of ground
—she knows she is going to turn, and round she
goes like a vvell-oileri
flick of lightning. But
Bluey and Fido have
to get round by main
force, and when it is
hard and gravelly un-
derfoot, they tear off
toenails and stoppers
in the process. After
the second day there
were only two un-
abridged dogs left in
the two events—Penny-
form (Derby) and
Magic (Oaks). They
won. Pennyform was
brought from Forbes,
and his supporters
backed him from card-
call on as if the other
starters had developed
extreme old age and
rheumatism overnight.
For once it came off.

“Cob”: A Tasmanian report states that
the people who run Tattersall’s sweeps are thinking
of broadcasting their drawings. It would certainly
be a fine ad. for the sweeps, if listeners-in could
be apprised of each winning number as it came hot
from the barrel. And other possibilities are being
considered. Publication of lottery results is not
permitted in some States, and proprietors of main-
land stations would have to be sure of their position
before they took the proposal on. Still, the Com-
monwealth Government and the States that ban
Tatt.’s would be powerless to interfere if the Queens-
land Government decided to broadcast Golden Casket
information, using its own station, nor could they
make flesh of one big sweep-promoter and fish of
another.

Jim Willard, one of last year's Olympic
team, was at the top of his form in the City of
Sydney tournament at the Sydney C. G. J. O.
Anderson, who is naeking up for the trip to Wimble-
don before the Davis Cup comes round, was the
only notable not in flannels; and the way Willard
trounced the opposition made the crowd regret that
J.O. was not defending his title. Willard’s opponent
in the final was R. O. Cummings, and after losing
the first set at 7 —9, Willard won the other three:
7—5, 10 —8, 6—3. In the mixed doubles,
Willard and Miss Cox took the trophies; and in
the doubles, Jim and H. Hopman accounted for
A. Willard and K. Poulton in straight sets.
“S. Giimm”: To me there is nothing sug-
gestive of war in the spectacle of two perspiring
youths playing tennis, but modern writers on the
game love to draw their images from the business
of blood and iron. And what word-painters they
are! In a Melbourne paper I read of a rubber-
smacker who went down because “he did not use the
same weapons as in 1924,” because, in short, “the
tapestry of his intentions was rent to tatters by the
implacable hand of a determined adversary who
revealed a power to smite that was as destructive
in its ruthless force as it was unabating in its
intensity.” At one stage of the terrific struggle,
however, the winner “broke out into an eczema of
errors.” Came a doubles match in which Bloggs,
“with whom a reverse always kindles fresh ardor,
started a vigorous counter-attack. The play, save
for an occasional breakdown, was most real in
dramatic style and controlled force. There was a
magnificent audacity in the risks taken by Bloggs
and Sloggs with the second service, which was
almost as destructive as the first. The annihilating
force of these two players’ crushing service deliveries
put them among the destroyer class of Attila, the
Hun, and Genghis Khan.” A striking comparison
truly—Attila and Genghis, of the multitudinous
harems and the skull-pyramids, all trophies of their
conquests, and two well-groomed tennis-johnnies whose
fiercest indiscretion is probably afternoon tea. If
there is anything left of the dust of the two
conquerors it must have rolled over in their graves.

“F.C.”: Melbourne golfers are doing Moo-
rabbin market-gardeners a good turn—or a bad one,
according to how you look at it. For years these
grafters vainly besought the Board of Works to let
them have water. When the golfers laid out their
new links at Cheltenham, at Centre-road, beyond
Oakleigh, and at Burwood, the Board became reason-
able, and now many gardeners round these links have
the water. But as soon as the fluid is on tap, Ah
Sin, dispossessed of his cabbage plot nearer the
city, comes along. Several Moorabbin gardens have
been lately let to John at £B, £lO and up to £l3
per acre p.a. The owners, having made a moderate
competence these last few years, now retire and
collect from £3 to £6 per week rent.
Millaa Millaa” : Ravenshoe (Q.), centre
of a timber district, owns a nine-hole golf course,
and the club numbers amongst its enthusiasts timber-
getters, loaders and a bullocky. Visiting golfers
now have the choice of a wonderful range of ex-
pletives, and the issue of a Ravenshoe vocabulary for
the use of players in the effete South has been
suggested.

Poor little Jack Green, who was a crack
featherweight at 17 and a has-been at 20, was
resurrected by the Sydney Stadium people on Satur-
day to fill a date with their new colored “champion”
l>e Leon. Green is one of the victims of the 20-
round business (Jerry Sullivan is another), and it
is a business from which boys should be barred. For
a few rounds Green was much the cleverer of the
pair, but when his impaired strength left him he
was an easy mark for the Filipino’s fierce blows, and
in the twelfth round the towel arrived. At that
moment the pathetic sacrifice to the 20-round super-
stition was leaning against the ropes, dazed but
dead game, in expectation of the finishing punch.
At Brisbane the same night Gordon, who went 16
rounds with De Leon, was knocked out in seven
rounds by the Cuban Fernandez, whom Melbourne
regarded as a joke. On this form De Leon is not
the “champion” he is alleged to be.

When Karasick. the burly Russian, entered
the ring at the Melbourne Stadium to wrestle Thve,
an admirer handed him up a wreath of flowers. This
thoughtful act brought a lump to the throat of many
a susceptible three-bobber. For a time Karasick’s great
strength nullified Thye’s superior science, and the
Muscovite’s headlock made the American wilt visibly.
Three applications in the fifth session left Thye so
groggy that he conceded a fall which would have
come anyhow. In the sixth round the now cock-
sure Karasick leapt into the air to annihilate Thye.
The latter stepped aside, and Karasick, describing
a perfect aerial parabola, crashed on the crown of
his head. He got up dazed, and Thye, who has a
fast technique, proceeded to repeat the dose. Three
times in rapid succession he thudded Karasick on to
his occiput, and then the latter curled up and went
to sleep. He came to in his corner five minutes later,
and, on being told that he had lost, burst into tears.
These wrestlers are an emotional race.

“Hambone”: Uni. cricketer Jim Garner,
whom the Sydney Coroner patted on the back for his
attempts to rescue a man washed from the rocks
at Bondi, went from the Sydney High School in
1913 to a draftsman’s stool in the Public Works
Department. After two years of that he had a look
at Egypt and France from the inside of a gunner’s
uniform, and finished up his war service as A.D.C.
to Brigadier-General Lloyd. Returning to Sydney in
1919, Jim turned his back on his old job and
tackled a five years’ med. course at an age when
most men have completed it. Garner is a valuable
man with both bat and ball, and his left-hand slows
are deadly on a sticky wicket. He might have
been another Rhodes had he taken the game seriously,
but it is not in his nature to do that.
* ♦ * »
“Shrewsbury”: It is evident from Gilli-
gan’s remarks since he returned, and from press com-,
ment, that England is not going to fall into line with
this country in the matter of the eight-ball over.
It is pure conservative prejudice, because our Aus-
tralian bowlers, playing under far more trying con-
ditions, are quite satisfied with the innovation, and
the statistics of the English team’s tour show that
it cut, out hundreds of change-overs which would
have taken place with the six-ball over. The writer
can recollect the storm which the proposed addition
of a fifth ball to the over caused in English cricket
in the ’eighties. There were more threats of revolu-
tion when the suggestion of a sixth ball was put
forward. Now that sports once purely British have
been taken up by other nations, the Gold Country
will have to shed its hardshell notions. The
Dominions have long ago varied cricket and football
rules to suit their own tastes. Now the French
Rugby Union has decided to adopt Maoriland rules
for next season, and as France is one of the Euro-
pean International Five, the English will presumably

have to follow suit or retire into seclusion, as Scot-
land once did on a question of amateurism.
* * * *
“11. Hardupp”: The outstanding feature
of the Victorian cricket team’s M.L. tour was the
success of Woodfull on wickets which were rather
like English wickets—much more like them, cer-
tainly, than the Bulli and Merri Creek pitches of
Australia. In the “tests” Woodfull scored 310 runs
in three innings without once being out; in all the
games he had an average of 148.33. His Sheffield
Shield averages in the last four seasons have been 85.G6,
36.28, 89.25 and 61.75 ; and he was one of the
very few Australians who shaped well on a bail
wicket against Gilligan’s lefthanders. Woodfull's
caution is against him in Australia, hut old hands
who have been to England aver that his watchful
methods would just suit the slow wickets of that
country, and that he would be as successful there
as either Sandham or Hearne.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury” : In the most famous event
in Soccer football, the final of the Association Cup,
Sheffield United beat Cardiff City, I—-0,1 —-0, in the
presence of Royalty and 90,000 others at Wembley.
It was a battle between the past and the up-to-date,
for while the Blades are one of the oldest pro-
fessional clubs in the Association and League, Cardiff
City is a post-war side, carved out of that dyed-in-
the-wool Rugby Union community, Wales. Like
their deadly' rivals, Sheffield Wednesday, Uniteds
have lifted both the cup and the League champion-
ship. The latter they won as long ago as 1897-9 S,
while they have taken the cup on three previous
occasions, 1899, 1902 and 1915, reaching the final
with Tottenham Hotspur in 1901. Bramall Lane,
well known to many an Australian cricketer, is their
club ground. Neither of the finalists is represented
in the English team shortly due in Australia.
* * * *
“Matliari” : There will be no lack of big
football in Sy’rlney this winter. The Rugby Union is
getting ready for a Maoriland invasion, the English
S ecer team will play a series of matches, and the
League will entertain XII Us from Queensland and
M.L. The League season will begin at the week-end.
There will be the same number of clubs as last year,
but men famous in the past will be missing, as a
result chiefly of Queensland and provincial induce-
ments, and it will be a critical season for the code.
Umpires have been instructed to see that the scrum is
formed properly and that the ball is placed in the
scrum. A sensible, though belated, move, for scrum-
maging has degenerated to a farce.
* * * *
“FY7”: Complaints are being heard from
Queensland of the rush of N.S.W. League footballers
to the North, importations threatening to swamp the
rep. teams up there “to the detriment of the younger
players.” On last season’s comparative form, it
hardly looks as bad as that, but the practice is
a bad one. It was not uncommon in the Queens-
land Rugby Union of bygone days, when hardly a
season went by without some N.S.W. or M.L. star
being induced to take up his abode in the North.
One new club in the ’nineties landed nearly half a
team from Maoriland and N.S.W., building up from
local stuff. As it was the only side to indulge in
wholesale methods of the sort, no great harm was
done. With cricket it was another story. N.S.W.
and Australian XI lights of other days were imported
by some of the clubs, notably that of the now
defunct Graziers’ Butchering Company. These men
had a mortgage for a long time on the representa-
tive teams, where they rarely did much good, apart
from keeping young local talent from coming to the
front.
* * * *
“Q.K.”: Duncan Thompson (B. 16/4/’25)
has never been a Rugby Union player, except per-
haps in a few battalion games in France. As :i
youth of 19 he repped for the Queensland League in
1915, And in those days League was a crime in
Queensland. And tell “Past Grammar” that the
Union game is not confined to juniors in the north-
eastern State. It’s dead. The majority of juniors
haven’t even seen it played. They go in for a
brand of League revised by Mr. Rafferty and generally
supervised by the police.
* * # *
“G. 0.8.” : Many clever exponents of Aus-
tralian football have inherited their talent. Witness
young Moriarty, of Fitzroy, who la t year eclipsed
all previous goal-kicking records; his dad, Geoff,
was for years the best centre in the game. And
old Ted Rankin, of Geelong, handed on his ability to
his sons. Like their father they both earned places
in many inter-State teams; Bert as centreman,
and Cliff (he was full-back with the A.I.F. Rugby
XV) nearer the goal. Charlie Pannan, whose coach-
ing has improved Stoush Melbourne so wonderfully,
is a son of Collingwood’s greatest wing man. During
the Magpies’ happiest period, Jack Monahan and
“Rosy” Dummett were the best of their backs,
and it is a coincidence that a son of each starts
this year with the old team. Mel. Morris, of
Richmond, still maintains the family tradition. His
dad, Arthur, and his uncles Jim and Maesmore
(husband of the actress), were stalwarts with Mel-
bourne long ago. Another Tiger with inherited
genius is “Fishy” Taylor; his old man, wearing the
same nickname, was Richmond’s champion in
Association days. Dave Dick, Essendon’s find of
the season, is also of splendid stock. His forebears
helped the Same Old when their headquarters were
at Jolimont.
* * • •
“Hamer” : Alec Eason, the sinews of tin*
Footscray Association team, has suffered by the
League’s absorption of his crowd. He originally be-
longed to Geelong, but the works which employed
him closed, and, looking about for a job, he was
offered one at Footscray if he would join the
Association team. The League declined to give him
a clearance, so he went ahead without it and w T as
disqualified. That disqualification apparently robbed
him of his job when the League took Footscray
over, but Murtoa (League) offered him £l2 per week
as trainer and coach and Brighton (Ass.) extended
a £lO per week bait. On the understanding that
the Murtoa people had got the League Council to
promise the removal of his disqualification, Eason
v'aited and lost both jobs, Brighton getting Gordon
Rattray, another man blocked from re-entry to the
League. Eventually Prahran came along with the
offer to find Alec a job, and he has taken that.

“O. McKay M.” : Melbourne Uni. had its
42nd intercollegiate boatrace last Friday, and Queen s
its ninth win. In the first heat Trinity, 1921
champions, got in a canvas ahead of Queen’s after a
great race, but the winners lost their chance of
carrying off the final through a technical disquali
fication. Queen’s had no difficulty in accounting for
Ormond (who had eliminated the Newman boat) on
the second day, and Trinity got some consolation
but of a win in the second eights’ race. The
Queen’s crew included E. W. Gault, a rowing blue,
and J. W. Cook, who got his blue for football. The
Mervyn Bournes Higgins trophy goes to the winner-.
THE STAYERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A horse-race of 800 miles with 38 runners,
which will probably last a month, began on Wednes-
day. The course of 20 miles is on a ranch near
Buenos Ayres, and the contest is to determine whether
the criollo, the native Argentine horse of the
Pampas, is superior to the best horses of pure
breed.” —News item.
No scrambling, short-lived flutter there, with pygmy
riders up ;
No mile or two-mile gallop for a betting coup or
CUP ;
No ladies strolling on the lawn to praise the silken
sheen
Of horses that they’ve backed with Mo, or “specked”
on the machine.
No, but eight hundred miles to run, to prove—and
prove, indeed,
If the rough-haired Pampas equine can defeat the
purest breed ;
To prove if champions chosen by the experts of the
la nd
Are better than the “ready-mades” that cowboys
understand.
I guess if I were there I’d cheer the rugged “mon-
grels” on ;
For I have seen the brumbies in the old Bush days
long gone—
Seen them crashing through the timber, climbing
mountain-side and spur,
And then dashing down declivities, nose-diving,
I aver!
If I were chased by troopers grim and asked to
quickly choose
A quadruped to carry me lest I my freedom lose,
I’d take the tough criollo or the brumby “broken
in”
To bridle and to saddle—and I guess that I would
win!

Which music do you think likely to be the best—that which
comes through a permanent diamond selected with infinite care
and skilfully ground and polished under a microscope to a perfect
fit in the groove of the record? Or that which comes through a
steel or fibre needle—neither of which are smooth or polished or
ground to fit the record groove?
Which music is best—that which comes from a reproducer whose
diaphragm is made out of an entirely new and sensitive material,
the result of countless experiments by Mr. Edison? Or that which
comes through an ordinary natural substance—mica—not made
for reproduction, but just accidentally discovered as partly suitable?
New Edison music is best be-
cause it comes through a per-
manent diamond and through
Mr. Edison’s own new dia-
phragm material.
The great inventor believed
good music to be worth nothing
less than perfect recording and
perfect reproduction; now he
offers you the result of his
labor—The New Edison—an
instrument that differs in every
feature from regular talking-
machines—the flawless product
of a master mind in science
and acoustics.

"Sucre”: Seven Chinamen are in partner-
ship in Campbell-street, Sydney. There is
£BOO in gold in their safe. To the safe there
are seven locks, all different:, and each part-
ner has one key. They tell you they are
welly good friends and want to remain so.
A German vessel, the Gottingen, arrived
at Fremantle the other morning. Lying
alongside was the Bambra, trading on the
Westralian North Coast, and the captain
spotted her at once. She was under his
charge when the war broke out, but was
commandeered and given a new name. It
was quite an affectionate meeting.
“B.” ; Is this a new swindle? The usual
method of disposing of suit lengths- appeals
to cocky, who is always partial to a bargaiii.
In our district a man had done fair busi-
ness, delivering the goods for cash. Within;;
two or three days a couple of others turned
up, described the transactions and the goods,
and demanded the return of the latter, as
they were stolen property. Fearing ' exposure
the cockies dubbed up the suit lengths and
lost both money and goods. The men who
demanded their return didn't, of course, say
they were detectives; they merely said they
were anxious to keep the poor cockies out
of gaol!
“Nom”: Jim Troy, who bosses the delivery
department for a Sydney cake-making co.,
is one of the five selected Labor candidates
for Western Suburbs at the coming N.S.W.
elections. Troy is by no means a dunce, but
considers that talk has brought on most of
the calamities of the world, from the; ten
plagues to the bad egg that hit Billy Hughes
at Warwick; so he says little. During the
last two elections in this division Labor has
held on to two seats with an improving
margin, and as subdued talkers make few
enemies it looks as if sitting Laborites
McTiernan and Lazzarini’s No. 2 votes may
shift the balance and give Troy's no-talk
theory a test in Macquarie-street.
“Topee”: There are still some snuff-takers
in Sydney (B. 2/4/’25), though their num-
ber is diminishing annually. The manager
of the shop where I get my weed tells me
he Has now 13 customers using between them
about' fib. weekly. Before the war ne sold
81b., and 20 years ago, when he first came
to the shop, about 51b. Young people now
call for mosf of the stuff for aged relations
mostly Irish and Scots. He thinks his
firm in all its branches might supply a couple
of hundred Taddy consumers. By the way,
was “dipping” ever in vogue in Australia?
This was a practice affected by American
flapperdom 50 years back and reputed to be
epidemic in girls’ boarding-schools. It con-
sisted of using snuff as a tooth-powder for
some recondite joy to be obtained thereby.
“The Rumpus”: Nobody ever made a
quicker change than another chap and I on
the Ashburton (W.A.). A boundary-rider
was required, and we arrived simultaneously
at the station from different directions. My
lower limbs were cased in dungarees, the
other applicant sported travel-stained moles.
Woolbales interviewed us in his office at
the end of his back verandah, and when he
had finished his look-over the overseer came
in and we were told to steD outside. Plainly
we heai-d the squatter instruct his overseer
to take the pan in dungarees. Moles looked
pathetically 'at me, and, in reply to a swift
question, owned that he had a wife and
family near starving at Geraldton. Not-
withstanding that Mrs. Woolbales was sweep-
ing the passage not 10 feet away, by urn
spoken agreement we swapped pants. When
we’d finished we heard the boss say: “The
bloke in moles you can keep here on light
work until lie fills a bit; then we’ll fit him
in.” We exchanged into our own leg-covers
again before the missus could lift an eyelid.
“Nikko” : The method of “Simon’s” news-
agent with his creditors (B. 9/4/’2a) re-
minds me of our local photographer. One
Saturday morning the whole village gathered
round his window to read a notice stating
that the pictures of all those who had for-
gotten to pay would next week be placed
in the window, masked with white paper
which would be gradually peeled off, so that
by the following Saturday the infamy of
many esteemed citizens would be fully ex-
posed. The proceeding caused a, sensation.
Traffic was nearly blocked about the middle
of the week, when portions of and
bits of evening frocks and stiff collars came
into view. Numerous caps began to appear
on the board, as sensitive people redeemed
themselves by settling up arrears. By Friday
night there were only three photographs left,
each with the face still covered. Saturday
morning revealed the wrathful eye of a local
J.P. famed for his bad temper, and the chin
o? the daughter of an old and impoverished
family, who, by a frenzied last-minute pay-
ment, escaped further publicity. At noon
our J.P. strode down the street, thrust his
brawny arm through the glass with appro-
priate comment, seized himself and took him-
self home. That ended the sensation. We
never discovered who the last man was. and
I don’t know -who paid for the broken
window.
“C. Coral” on an ancient inhabitant; —
The old identities of Torres Strait are becoming
very few; another old-timer “close up , finish” is
Bamboo, of Darnley Island. Bamboo left the New
Hebrides 60-odd years back for Australia, the immi-
gration inducement in his case being “hatches on”
after he had been invited to view some attractive :
exhibits on a visiting schooner. From Sydney he
found his way on to beehe-de-mering boats working
up along the coast through Torres Strait, and
became one of the “boys” on Captain Banner’s boats,
which made their station at Warrior Island in the
’sixties. It was at Warrior Island that the natives
put on a dance in which they wore crescent-shaped
mother-o’-pearl neck ornaments; inquiry having
elicited that “plenty more stop along sea, close
alongside,” the boys were prevailed upon to bring
some, up for inspection. , So rich was the field that
the schooners were speedily laden and sent down to
Sydney, and the great “pearl rush” set in. Captain
Banner died at Warrior Island soon after, follow-
ing upon a jollification celebrating the discovery: a
headstone was erected over the grave, but the ele-
ments wrecked it and the fragments became grind-
stones for native axes. Bamboo Jaappcnod to be in
one of the vessels seized later on b.V Captain Moresby
in H.M.S. Basilisk (engaged in the suppression of
black-birded labor), and so got another trip
to Sydney. But he returned, and then big Guvment
came along and tacked the islands on to Queensland.
So “everybody got to keep quiet now; no more
fighting, no steal woman.”

Galli-Cui’ci, sustaining the whole pro-
gramme of her frequent Melbourne concerts
and showing a great liberality with extra
numbers, is putting a strain upon her voice
which very naturally makes itself evideiit
now and then. It would be wonderful if it
did not; what is rnoi’e wonderful is the
recovery the voice shows, as it did, for
instance, last Thursday. In Stefano
Donaudy’s “Song of May” her tone was dull,
and there was a marked uncertainty about
some of the phrasing; yet in the Barcarolle
from Meyerbeer’s “l’Etoile du Nord,” the
voice displayed a line freshness and con-
sistency. On that night also the lady
delighted her audience with Bellini’s “Qui
la Voce,” an offering in which she rose to
greater heights than in any other in which
she has been heard in Melbourne, her voice
displaying a radiancy which so spellbound
the house that there was a pause between
the conclusion of the brilliant effort and the
applause—in its way a greater tribute than
the applause itself. There was romance in
the singing of the Waltz Song from “Romeo
and Juliet” (Gounod) ; and in Novello’s
“Little Damozel” an exceptionally high note
was flung out amazingly from a lower-pitched
clusteix Actually, although there were
blemishes which were not so evident at the
second concert, in which she triumphed prin-
cipally in Rossini’s “Una Voce” and the
Mad Scene from “Lucia,” the third concert
was Galli-Curci’s best. But even Galli-
Curci plays to the gallery in giving some
trite English songs in which she is never
happy; her management of the English
tongue shows that the poetry that may be
found in it is still foreign to her. ‘Flautist
Manuel Berenguer has earned no improved
opinion by his later work; and there have
been occasions when Homer Samuels, usu-
ally a most sympathetic accompanist, would
have been better if his work had been less
heavy. Additional concerts are to be given
to-niglit (Thursday) and on Saturday.
“Skittles,” produced at Melbourne
Athenaeum on Saturday, is a chain of im-
probabilities linking the two ends of a
romance. Decorated with likeable comedy, it
provides remarkably fine entertainment in
spite of being spoilt as a play by the amaz-
ing assumption that the wild story may be
accepted as reasonable. Wiggleshaw, a gar-
rulous and lonely pawnbroker who disguises a
kind heart under a stern business aspect,
adopts a girl who brings a ring to pawn axid
is prepared to be adopted. Growiiig up in
an inn, with a rose-garden and a skittle-
alley, also owned by Wiggleshaw, she be-
comes “Skittles” by the time Lord Roftus
falls in love with her in the l-ose-garden set-
ting. Moved by an appeal made to her by
the young lord’s mother, Skittles breaks with
him; but the resolute Roftus becomes the
pawnbroker’s assistant, and is pursued in his
new calling by annoyed relations and his
fiancee, the Hon. Margaret Atherton. There
is trouble, too, over the ring, and it comes
out that Skittles,,who is the Hon. Margaret’s
poor cousin, pawned it for her. Matters are
smoothed by the patronising cousin falling in
love with the real pawnbroker’s assistant,
Lnurie Cokeley, leaving young Roftus to
Skittles.
* * * *
The preposterous story was compensated
on Saturday by bright comedy rendered by
a well-chosen company. The most distin-
guished success was that of Maggie Jarvis,
hitherto seen only in musical comedy. She
made the unreal Skittles seem almost real.
John D. O’Hai-a extracted all the quaint
humor and humanity intended to belong to
Wiggleshaw, who should have been bankrupt
instead of wealthy; and the young lover pi’e-
sented by Martin Walker was one of the
most likeable lovers this Showman has seen
for ages. James Grant was the pawnbroker’s
regular assistant, Laurie Cokeley; but he
suffered from the delusion that a strong
character can be represented by a voice that
is sometimes a roar. A finished perform-
ance was Emma Temple’s Lady Roftus.
Atholwood, Zoe Wencke (the Hon. Mar-
garet) , Lottie Sargent and Reg Roberts
satisfactorily filled other parts.
The properties of Brinsley Sheridan's
“School for Scandal” were shaken out fi - om
their lavender at Melbourne New Princess’s
on Saturday. The Allan Wilkie players
gave an easy and likeable resurrection of the
eld play, but Wilkie himself lost points by
portraying Sir Peter Teazle as a complacent,
middle-aged husband rather than as a
“tetchy” old man, and his moods were tamely
expressed. Miss Nellie Mortyne presented
a well-drawn Mrs. Candour, but Miss
Hunter-Watts might have made more of
Lady Teazle, and Marjorie Carr’s Maria was
an amateur. Ellis Irving failed to make
Charles Surface the likeable, robust spend-
thrift lie should be, but succeeded sulfieiently
to explain the ultimate preference of his
uncle, Sir Oliver Surface, in which part the
painstaking Gus Neville added to his list
of good works. The Moses of Walter Plinge
was one of the successes: and the other
people did what was required in a manner
that calls for no special notice. The old-
fashioned dance at the conclusion of Act I
was very nicely arranged.
** * *
A falling off in the quality of the Reper-
tory Society's work, which in "Dear Brutus”
reached a high standard, was shown in the
season at Melbourne Playhouse. The in-
ferior quality of the material was a handi-
cap. Edward Percy’s "If Four Walls Told”
mainly depends for its effect upon the charac-
ter drawing of the East Country English
villagers, whose mati'irnony and other domes-
tic troubles make the story: and since the
climax is reached at the end of the second
act, and everybody by that time, knows the
story’s ending, it might very well stop there.
The last act is a mere washing-up, in which
the dishwater is only slightly atoned for by
the soap-suddy comedy mixed with it.

As David Rysing, a crotchety old man
with the usual grumble about the degeneracy
of modern things, Helton Daniel made merely
an artificial success; it was palpable that lie
was acting all the time. Robert Guthrie
made a believable large-size boy with a
healthy appetite; Ethel Appleton was the
homely gossip, Mrs. Tibbett; and Betty Rae
(as Mrs. Sturgis) a cattish matron with
severe ideas about morality and soap. Edith
Bell (Clare Sturgis) gave a fair portrait of
a spiteful sister whose malice is miti-
gated when she herself achieves mati’i-
mony; and whilst. David Dorritty, as Ned
Mason, conveyed the awkwardness of the
simple character somewhat too awkwardly,
Graham Poock, as Toby Crouch, achieved
the best characterisation. Ceridwen Kelly,
though charming enough as Hope Tre-
goning, hardly gave the character suffi-
cient life. As a curtain-raiser “The
Grand Chaim's Diamond” was inconspicuous.
“Primrose” blooms under the sunshine of
public approval at Melbourne Majesty’s.
Apparently Frith is due to froth in this
meadow for some time.
Although “Little Jessie James” has lost a
powerful support in the melancholy debt-
collectoi*, Jack Kirby, who is by this time
conveying his impressions about the rolling
ocean to the other stars, she ti’ips along very
brightly with H. Burgess in the role of the
debt-collecting Williams.
AMELITA GALLI- CURCI, AT MEL-
BOURNE AUDITORIUM.
“The Masqueradex-,” at Melbourne King’s,
has so far re-established Guy Bates Post's
previous triumph that the piece may run for
longer than the intended fortnight. It must
be said that Post’s work in the dual role is
baffling. After viewing the show on three
occasions this showman still feels that John
Loder and John Chilcott are distinct per-
sonalities ; and as he knows they are both
Post, it is a very fine tribute to the actor.
The picture fans wave down nightly ap-
plause to Pauline Frederick at the Theatre
Royal, which apparently is to uudergo
“Spring Cleaning” until further orders.

Added to the attractions at Melbourne
Tivoli are Addison and Mitrenga, “the
greatest dancers on the English stage.”
Australia, in that case, has reason to con-
gratulate itself on having dancers of its
own. Maxim Brodi is a tenor from Russia
who will make no vaudeville history in Aus-
tralia. Tom Moore is better in his song
scenas, but his stuff has been overdone. The
entertaining Two Rascals and Bert Ralton’s
Band are still the chief items.
“THE TEN COMMANDMENTS,” AT
SYDNEY PRINCE EDWARD.
Eddie Horton, the organist, observes the
worship of the calves.
Stiffy and Mo, at Melbourne Bijou, are
plumbers now; and, needless to yay, they
plumb the excessive-charge business for all
it is worth. But the box-offiee has no com-
plaints. The rest of the programme is
good, including in Dinks and Trixie two
comedians, one of them a girl, who provide
real laughs.
Elaine Hammerstein, at’ Melbourne
Majestic, goes near the edge in “Daring
Love” ; but the big show is a “red-blooded”
picture-drama entitled “The Code of the
Wilderness.” “Flood Gates” are opened at
Hoyt’s De Luxe; and they are not shut, as
far as thrills and throbs are concerned, when
“The Man Without a Heart” is introduced.
The opening of the Regal, at Prahran, is
amongst the events of the week. It is won-
derful to what palatial splendor the picture-
show house has climbed in the suburbs.
The Pruned Art, Orchard :
The chaotic offering of the Victorian Artists’ Society
six months ago was not again seen at the exhibition
which opened last Monday (27th). * With John
Longstaff as president, and a solid council to help,
the pruning-knife has been busy ; the show is limited
to a little over 200 items. And still the knife
missed a few things it should have reached; a
reasonable guess is that in a wholesale slaughter
mercy sometimes prevailed in recognition of some
underlying merit. Probably some members who ex-
pected to be hung will be annoyed to find them-
selves merely cut; but the society’s new policy
will increase its prestige.
A lively portrait of Mrs. Fred Fairbairn by John
Longstaff is one of the outstanding features of the
exhibition, in which the portraiture is generally
at a high level; the character of the sitter is well
caught, and the draperies are superbly handled.
Charles Wheeler’s study of the Rev. E. H. Sugden
is another excellent piece of work; this and other
offerings of the same artist, in portraiture and land-
scape, show a great advance and an increase in
sureness. In his portrait of Mr. Watts, E. Buck-
master tries a light effect which is doubtfully
true; and he has an inclination to juggle with a
similar problem in some of his ’scapes, though they
remain pleasing. Miss Esther Paterson is very
successful in a painting of Mrs. Hugh Paterson;
and a self-portrait by John Hennessy is amongst
the very good things. Norman McGeorge lias three
graceful but undistinguished landscapes; W. D.
Knox, who is atmospherically fogged in “Radiant
Eve” (No. 44), makes a success of “The Timbered
Hills” (No. 37) and some others; and Miss Norah
Guidon shows very neatly what various brands of
weather look like on the mountains.
Outstanding amongst the landscapes is the appeal-
ing “Where All Is Peace” of Montague Brown.
Some satisfying work is presented by Carl Hampel,
R. G. McCann and Xicholls Anderson; but the harsh
portraits of Edward Marks are amongst the failures,
and Taylor Ghee, otherwise showing some faithful
woik, has got an extraordinary view of “Spring
Street, Melbourne,” in which the perspective has
gone on the jag. “Gladioli” is well done by Miss
A. M. E. Bale; and there is a good deal worthy
of notice from a host of other artists. And a good
deal it is kinder not to notice.
The water-color section is very much improved
on previous exhibitions, two delectable Wood’s Point
drawings of Harold Herbert’s being rivalled by the
romance painted into R. W. Sturgess’s “Deserted
Cottage” (No. 147) and “Ruins” (No. 148).
A Melbourne jumble sale:—
Miss Ina Gregory introduces herself to the ait
public with an exhibition which would be better if
at least half the 176 offerings had been left in
the lumber-room; it might indeed have been made
quite a good exhibition if a selected two score of
the works had been shown. In a number of the
canvases the artist is a mere imitator of her master,
E. Phillips Fox; others are incomplete and crude
in color, and suggest that the artist, having merely
half an idea of what she wanted to do, presented a
half-finished painting to express her state of mind.
A pastel portrait of C. A. Topp is, however, a reallv
good study; and “My Mother” (No. 64) and
“Portrait Study” (No. 67) are appealing. There is
atmosphere and good use of color in “A Sapphire
Sea, Mount Martha” (No. 126), and “A Dancing
Gum” (No. 18) is decorative and lively. In the,
charcoal studies some skilful handling is shown.
#* * *
The distressing- struggles of “The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray” to adjust herself to an un-
compromising environment was the Van-
brugh-Boucicault offering at Sydney Cri-
terion on Saturday, and the impression
gained was that economic changes have ren-
dered the gloomy drama entirely out of date.
With a surplus in Britain of two million
females, the Paulas of to-day cannot be got
rid of with a pistol shot. They have risen
to the dignity of a problem of State. In
Germany, where the surplus is over three
millions, polygamy has been suggested as a
means of quietly exploding an ammunition
dump which, if left at large, is likely to end
in blowing up society at large. Accord-
ing to one authority, 40 per cent, of the
Paulas of London become perfectly respect-
able Mrs. Tanquerays, primus or secundus,
and rear large families. The O Paula Sans
of Yokohama frequently arrange with their
Japanese fiances to go forth into the waste
places of the earth to lighten the existences
of lonely white men, returning with the
dowry they have earned to set up house as
respectable mater-familiases. Considera-
tion of the position of the Mrs. Tanquerays
of this generation leads to the conclusion
that the real offence of Pinero’s Paula was
being born before her time; also, once hav-
ing revolted against a society that had sin-
fully ill-treated her, being so foolish as to
go down on her knees and ask it for for-
giveness. After that piece of weakness there
was nothing left for it but the melodramatic
curtain despairfully devised by the play-
wright. The time is doubtless coming when
the trades union of two million Paulas will
have the conventions altered by Act of Par-
liament.
* * * *
The unreality of the theme, therefore, made
the task of the performers extremely hard,
and that their exposition was tolerably con-
vincing reflects to their credit. The long,
long recantation of the professional lady
found out in the third act taxed Irene Van-
brugh, and the ear ached for some high
notes in the monotonous stream of misery ;
her crescendo outburst at the end of the
second act was also hard to follow; but in
her other moods she carried the audience
with her. C. M. Hallard was not as good
as usual in the part of the well-meaning
husband; but Janet Eccles as the vestal vir-
gin who, under different circumstances,
might have been another Paula, carried a
heavy part through with high skill. Ethel
Wellesley did not make much of Lady
Orreyed, but Pirie Bush was reasonably ob-
noxious as her sottish husband. Dion
Boucicault discharged with distinction his
usual mission as family confessor. When
that delightful gentleman doffs his buskins
lie should be supplied with a rod and a
cubicle at St. Peter’s, Rome, and be set up
in practice as a fisher of female souls.
“Belinda,” her first appearance in Sydney,
will succeed Mrs. Tanqueray 11. on Thurs-
day.
“The Maid of the Mountains,” resurrected
on Saturday at Sydney Royal for a term of
nine nights, is pre-jazz fauna. It is a
musical comedy that does quite frequently
contain music; also comedy that is not ex-
clusively slap-stick. If this delving into pre-
historic strata continues. Gilbert and Sulli-
van may one day be re-discovered and prove
useful study for the modern producers of
variety shows masquerading as comic opera.
The revival was in the hands of a capable
staff. Gladys Monerieff as the Maid was
caught back to the bosom of Sydney with
rapture, and sang her gratification in full,
rich tones, robustly seconded by Claude Flem-
ming. as the brigand chief Baldassare. Flem-
ming’s singing was better than his acting.
John Ralston, as Beppo. assisted the tuneful
choir with melody lavishly embroidered with
passion, while Nellie Payne, as Vittoria, and
Byrl Walkley, as Angela, lifted voices
slighter but full of charm. The Maid
will come down from her Mountains for the
last time on May 5 to give “The Merry
Widow” time to prepare her toilet for a
three-nights’ appearance, commencing on
May 6.
Arundel Orchard presented a musical first
night at the Sydney Con. last week. The
work was the Bach Mass in B Minor —it

was first performed in its entirety in Berlin
in 1835, about 100 years after its composi-
tion. Taken as a whole the work is sublime
but rather monotonous. This is due to the
fact that Bach keeps to the same tone color
for the whole of a section instead of varying
it continually as other composers do. The
whole is so balanced it smacks of logic—•
it made one think of a convert through con-
viction. True, the soul of the convert wings
its way to the very bar of Heaven in relb
gious exaltation, as in the “Kyrie Eleison”
and in the jubilant “Gloria.” But the
“Credo” is not so much an instinctive cry of
belief as a sustained confession of faith. The
work of the orchestra and choir proved much
more interesting and soul-stirring than that
of the soloists. The solos are difficult and,
though they were for the most part correctly
sung, the singers seemed so concerned about
getting the notes and time right that no
attempt was made at interpretation. Par-
ticularly noticeable was this in the “Quoniam
Tu Solus Sanctus,” which to Catholic ears
lacked inspiration. In other respects basso
Reginald Gooud was a Samson. Cyril Monk’s
violin was a vibrant ingredient of the Lau-
damus; and Willie Hughes, Florence Yates
and Molyneux Phillips carried out tile diffi-
cult solo work. Arundel Orchard more than
earned his hosannas.

that with a little twist he can turn the most

Sydney Fullers’ clients have a real griev-
ance : it concerns the mysterious disappear-
ance of the ballet from George Wallace’s
half-programme revues. The revues have
never attained any great heights, but what-
ever glory they did have was mainly due to
the sliapely-limbed beauties who twirled
their way into popular fancy at their first
appearance. Of late the ballet has been
missing and the more regular patrons _ are
wearing an air of infinite sadness, especially
as it is rumored that a few of them had paid
deposits on opera-glasses. On the variety
side, Walter Vernon, a ventriloquist, with a
sense of humor and a voice free from the
typical huskiness of his business, is causing
considerable levity.

“North of 36,” at Sydney Strand, is a
better-than-average story of the wild and
woolly West; and, incidentally, the scene
where 10,000 or so cattle stampede takes

Without a Heart” gets a move on with
what looks like a double elopement, lands
in the midst of a most unholy tangle, but
finishes at the post with all the loose ends
tucked away. It happens at Hoyt’s, where
also “The Kingdom Within.” weak melo-
drama with a touch borrowed from Hickson,
bids for attention.

the play, and they are well supported by

From an Adelaide critic: —
The autumn show of South Aus. Society of Arts
takes second place to that in the spring. It en-
livened competition this time by offering an open
prize for Still Life. The result is a multitude of
brass pots and idols, tomatoes and curtains. A non-
member, Dora Cant, is the winner. Some interest
attaches to the return from Europe of James Ferries,
who in earlier days used to paint ambitious classical
“compositions” lacking in draughtsmanship. His
new line is landscape, with buildings, heavily painted
in a solid fashion that is oddly attractive and recalls
the work of a century back.

THE PUP FROM THE NEXT-DOOR STUDIO:
“Hullo, Higgins, what’s up? Don’t you
like posing for that artist of yours?”
HIGGINS : “Oh, I don’t mind letting him draw
me, hut I do object when he reads his
jokes to me to see if they’d make a cat
laugh.”
“Te Pana”: Charles Blake (B. 16/4/’25),
playing Ned Kelly under the MacMahon
brothers’ direction at Westport (M.L.), had
his own ideas of comedy suitable to patrons
of the drama. In the big scene he addressed
his horse: “You are me only friend. I am
hounded be the perlice and hunted be dogs:
but you are faithful to the end. Come, old
man, I’ll share even me tucker with you.”
Charley then felt in the slack of his pants
and dredged forth a large carrot which he
proceeded to feed to Dobbin. AVestport still
reckons that this interlude alone was worth
the price of admission.
“Hamfat”: Australians who were never
known in Australia as actors, even in the
“smalls,” have made reputations overseas.
Leon Errol (B. 2/4/25) is one of them.
Errol, son of a N. S. AVales postal official,
found it hard to get even a hearing in Aus-
tralia, so he worked his way to U.S.A.,
landed in New York with two dollars, and
got a stage job before he had time to spend
them. I-lis climb was rapid. When his
name began to figure among the lights of
Broadway, he invited his mother and father
to visit him, and saw to the expenses. On
arrival they found a cosily-furnished house
on Long Island prepared for their reception
by the son who had wandered and found
success but wasn’t satisfied till the old folk
could share it.
“0. Ockney”: Titian-haired Irene Browne,
who did so much capital work in Australia
in Shakspearean and other “straight” roles,
is now appearing in the American musical
comedy, “No, No, Nanette!” at London
Palace. She is spoken of by various critics
as having one of the best singing voices in
the company. Irene was never called upon
to sing in this country; her talent as a
vocalist wasn’t, even suspected. But a good
many people here remember that she was
an accomplished pianist. Her first appear-
ance on the stage was made at the Knicker-
bocker, N’York, as one of the Dutch children
in “The Red Mill.” She was only 10 then,
and the engagement lasted three years.
“Codger”: Mention of Connie Gilchrist in
a recent Bulletin takes me back a few
years. Well do I remember the slip of a
girl with the wistful features who roused
London Gaiety frequenters to enthusiasm
with her skipping-rope dance. Such a simple
performance would probably not get a “hand”
nowadays. Anon when she played small
parts we prophesied a great future for
her as an actress; but she was not long
for the burlesque boards. In a London illus-
trated weekly I picked up the other day there
was a picture of “the Countess of Orkney’s
house-party.” The Countess and her pretty
daughter looked their parts to perfection.
Ma still had that well-remembered wistful
expression on her face—perhaps she was
dreaming of the old skipping-rope days.
“Hamfat”: Armidale (N.S.AV.) once had
a hall-caretaker who objected on conscien-
tious grounds to a bill which Alfred Dam-
pier had announced. “It wouldn’t be right
to put that on,” the man with the duster
remonstrated, “unless you get Mr. Dan
Barry’s permission—it’s one of Mr. Barry’s
pieces.” Dampier, seeming impressed, got
the owner of the troublesome conscience to
send a telegram for him ; and it took a joke
he enjoyed a great deal to induce Dampier
to pay for a needless telegram. Dan’s reply
that Alfred might use the play satisfied the
honest man. The piece was “East Lynne.”
“E.T.”: The credit of introducing “Queen
of My Heart” into the “Dorothy” score does
not belong to H. J. Leslie, as “Charlik” (B.
23/4/’25) states, but to George Edwardes.
This on the evidence of the singer of the
song. AYriting to a London newspaper on
the subject a year or two ago, Haydn Coffin
gave this interesting account of the happy
interpolation :
George Edwardes felt it necessary there should be
a solo for the character of Harry Sherwood, which
part was allotted to me. The composer of the
opera being in Australia, the shelves of Chappell’s
were searched for a ballad by Alfred Cellier, and
they unearthed “Old Dreams.” B. C. Stephenson,
a master of verse, at rehearsal “wrote in” upon
the copy which was given me to study from the
words of “Queen of My Heart.” I still hold this
copy as one of the proud possessions of my theatrical
career.
It was the irony of fate that soon after
Edwardes parted with the rights of the
opera, the number which he had selected
should have changed the fortunes of the
piece, which made a pile of money for its
new proprietor.
“Charlik” and a soprano :
It is sad to read that Albani (B. 23/4/’25) is
having a hard finish to her great career. I first
met her professionally at Plymouth in the late
’eighties. We were engaged to sing the soprano
and tenor parts in the late Sir Frederick Bridge’s
cantata “Callirrhoe,” a work ideal for performance
by musical societies. Albani was then a beautiful
woman with a glorious voice, and absolutely at the
top of her profession, and I considered it a great
honor that Dr. Bridge should have considered me
worthy to sing in her company. On ascending the
platform I assisted her to remove her cloak, and
1 observed that her corsage was bordered by gold
medallions, all of which had been royal gifts. With
youthful cheek I told her I would like to steal her.
“What for?” she promptly replied. “My artistic
value or my intrinsic worth?” “Both, Madame,” I
answered. In the artists’ room later she told her
husband (Ernest Gye) that I had been trying to
flirt with her. “Good luck to him!” he said, “I
never could ! ” When Albani visited Australia towards
the end of the ’nineties she brought young AVilliam
Pauli with her, and this fine baritone made such a
hit that J.O.W. persuaded him to remain for the
Royal Comic Opera Co., which was then being re-
organised, and which I joined in July, 1898. Pauli's
voice was hardly light enough for comic opera, and
he hated dancing, but he was very successful as
Henri in “Ma Mie Rosette.” Afterwards he went to
the U.S., where he had a tragic end. Albani’s
maiden name was Emma la Jeunnesse; she took her
professional name from Albany, Canada, not the
U.S. Albany, as many people would naturally think.
With all the regret one feels at the necessity, it
is good to know that she is being adequately assisted.
“Caractaeus”: Thanks to the art of the
press-agent, all the world knows Elsa Stralia,
born Fischer, but a brother, Hugo, is also
in public notice in Melbourne. He, too,
has the publicity sense well in evidence. A
member of the Public Service, he is usually
chosen for secretary when stunts and
“efforts” are toward. He did much war-
time organising, arranges present charitable
affairs for the Service, and is one of the
leaders in an attempt to put a Public Service
Football Club on the map. He had Elsa’s
photographs doing the round of the press
long before her professional boosters got into
their stride.
“Buddy”: I lifted it from the Hollywood
(U.S.A.) News:—
Pauline Frederick has sailed for Australia to
repeat her two greatest stage triumphs, “Spring
Cleaning” and “The Lady.” Australia considers
this the most important stage event in a decade.
A RECORD RUN.
STAR COMEDIAN (to veteran clergyman):
“What! Twenty-seven years at the.
same church without once changing the
bill! Gee whiz, in our business they
wouldn’t stand it twenty-seven nights .”
On her arrival in Sydney, Pauline Frederick will
be welcomed by no less than the Governor-General of
Australia, and she will be the guest of the Federal
Government on that day.
Nothing about the public holiday that was
declared in order that the whole six millions
of us might join in the welcome. And
Hollywood should be told that we wouldn’t
have got a mere Gov.-General to do the
honors if George Y. hadn’t cabled that ho
couldn’t come.
“Goldilocks”: One of the three actors
now astonishing Melbourne with their
beards (B. 16/4/’25) is Arthur Styan.
Beard and all, he was waiting for a
tram in a part of Melbourne where
trams are scarce when an affable stranger in
a motor-car came up and gave him a lift. On
the way to town the talk, mainly sustained
by the driver, was mostly upon the merits
of the car; and Styan had finally to check
it to ask to be dropped near the Glaciarium.
“There’s no skating there yet,” said the
driver. Styan explained that he was an
actor engaged in the making of a moving-
picture, and that the interiors were being
run off in the Glaciarium. “Actor!” ex-
claimed the motorist with a roaring laugh.
“Why, I took you for a squatter down from
the country and thought I’d Ixave a chance to
sell you the car!”
“Hamer”: Distinctly a feature of the
show at Melbourne New Princess’s is
Plamilton Webber, an acrobat and conjurer
among conductors. It is quite possible to
believe that the others of the orchestra are
mere automatons and that he is responsible
for all the noises. With a thrust of his
baton to the left he stuffs sound into the
bass horn; with an upward flick he draws
notes from the violins ; with a downward stroke
of the magic wand he produces a crash of
sound from the opposite corner. Next, with
a heave of his arms he drags a crescendo
from the whole tribe of instruments, only to
tone down the stridency of the horns with
an extended little finger, whilst with a crook
in the forefinger he extracts a ripple from
the flutes. Musicians who have worked
under him say the by-play is most helpful,
and always accurate; plain theatregoers who
cared to analyse what they paid for would
certainly say that a few bobs’ worth of their
amusement was garnered in watching the
conductor.
AUGUSTUS BROWNE, TRAGEDIAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Since first, an infant prodigy,
Augustus Browne was led to show
His lisping tricks by strategy,
The theme they chose for him was woe.
Quite fruitless all attempts he made
To win away from tears and' groans;
They taught him tales of babes waylaid,
And gnomes and bears that crunched their bones.
And when, a school-reciting youth,
This tide of grief he strove to check,
They turned him to “The Death of Ruth,’’
“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck.”
The growing ’Gustus still they gave
Salt tears as sole artistic food;
They prayed of him such numbers grave
As “Parted” and “Not Understood.”
In vain, though manfully, he tried
To slip to realms where laughs abound.
They were not happy till they cried;
A moat of mis’ry ringed him round.
At twenty to the stage he strayed,
All fearfully and faint of heart.
His talent shone; straightway he played
A broken-hearted father’s |?art.
And quick to glowing fame he won ;
The wmnder spread from town to town j
In any clime, ’neath ev’ry sun,
Was heard the magic name of Browne.
Then, greatly hoping, once again
In comedy he sought to please;
They only cried aloud their pain,
And sobbed at joyous repartees.
“0 God 1 ” sighed Browne, “’tis surely tough;
They’ll let me only rant and moan;
Of all this soulful, sobful stuff
I’m weary, weary to the bone.
“Of broken-hearted jesters they
Make poetry! But what, of me
Who, while I whine and whimper, pray.
And. simply ache to shriek with glee?”
And now they say (sad aftermath)
That Browne, unheeding praise and pelf,
Through lonely hours, locked in the bath,
Tells funny stories to himself.

turer in the world.
The Republic Truck with its new Contin-
ental Red Seal Engine. Detachable Cylinder
Heads, Full Pressure Lubrication, Remov-
able Front Cross Member, Drive Shaft

Old C.: Good. WIT see if it won’t make
a picture... .Apeb: Comb it out; the stuff’s there,
but it’s all tangled L.B. (Eliz. Bay): Much
obliged. But we’ve printed it all. And apparently
the author has read the paragraphs.... Nut Quad:
It was discussed at length only a few months ago.
. ...8.R.T.: You’ll do nothing worth while till you
get your ear tuned... .Copper R.: Pollycleetan is
correct... .J.S.D.; Too late... .Magic: You’ve made
it too complicated... .H.H.M.: It’s had more atten-
tion than it was w0rth....39: There isn’t enough
scenery on your road to make it interesting....
A.L.S.; The thin stream of verse dribbles on until
it loses itself.... Dorothy C.: Good enough phrasing,
but deficient in idea?.... Arthur S.: Falls very short.
. ...M.C.P.: Verse that runs smoothly to say very
little....Askarri: Nothing there... .Wattle Bark :
You must get a better idea of metre W.E.8.:
Honestly, it couldn't be much worse... .Main Brace:
Possibilities, but you haven’t made the best use
of them.... Vejia E.; Doesn't quite convince#...
George Iv.: Little Tommy doesn’t make a yarn....
R. ; A mechanical story cut to a well recognised
pattern... .L.O. (Wynnum): Good enough verse put
to a poor use... .E.S.H.P.: The idea is not very
fresh.... Charles C.: The construction is not bad,
but as verse it is weak and lacking in interest. Why
do you try the sonnet before you have mastered
simpler forms?... .A.R.H.: A long way from good
enough... .0.M.D.: The yarn is,too weak and slight.
....Ethel D.; “The Spoiler” misses. But we had
hopes of it at one time... .Parnelli: Doesn’t strike
us hard F'.J.K.J.: Far too crude W.J.T.:
Misses the ’bus... .E.R.W.: Very p00r... .Freedom:
Can’t find the resemblance to Burns; but you are
in no danger from the people you mention....
A.A.K.: Both tale and verse are too lumpy....
E.S.J.: The old native has not enough interest
Ripponlea: The domestic fragrance makes a strong
appeal:—
When to the South the North Wind courses,
Comes an incense as of shoeing horses;
’Tis Mr. Chesswas, my right-hand neighbor,
Filling in time with manual labor.
His hands are black and his dial grubbish,
Hard at work burning rubbish.
He is burning hats and mats and lino.
How he can stand it I’m dashed if I know!
I’ll serve him a summons, I’ll make him squeak!
I’ll haul him up in front of a beak.
Goodness knows I hate to be uppish;
But I can’t stand a neighbor burning rubbish.
... .Flicker: The yarn doesn’t grip us... .Claude A.:
The verse is wooden and clumsy... .1.D.: “The
Widow” hardly does it.... Lily D.: As a first
attempt it has an honorable mention... .8.Z.: You
know the way; now find something to write about.
John Z.: A bad sample of the worst kind of
verse C.W. (Ballina): The verse is poor and
there is nothing in the snake yarn except the
mode of telling, which is old and tiresome John
S. : Very bad A.T.A.: It gets to nothing on the
road to nowhere.... A.L.L.: Sorry, nothing like it.
Mary R.: Not up H.AV.S.: “Shearing Time”
must go back Bellerive: The careful observation
and sympathetic treatment make it very telling:—
He’d shrieketh for he’s daily seed
And gaily leap about,
Proudly strut the kitchen floor
Whene’er I let him out;
He’d an appetite for apple-core,
. A peanut or a carrot,
And often tried to imitate
The chatter of the parrot.
Lengthy was he’s span of life,
When, alas, one summer day,
Stricken by a fatal stroke,
He quickly passed away.
I realised that all was o’er,
And all that I could do
Was dig a grave and lower down
'The poor old cockatoo.
NX. (Katoomba) : Doesn’t move us... .H.H.P.:
They all miss the touch that would give them life.
A.A.A.: The verse fails Peter: The mirth
mostly consists in saying that the people laughed;
but why they laughed is a mystery F.J.H.:
There is a glimmer in it, but not enough to light
it through... .Louise L.: All that bad spelling to
get to so small a point! But the writing could be
worse.... S.B. (Kalgoorlie): Too mechanical; and
the whole thing is obvious from the start... .1.R.W.:
Too long for its interest.... Roger H.: Not worth
while... .W.B. (Rippon Lea): “A Casual Job”
is so casually told that the happenings don’t seem
to matter Unley: Don’t believe him. It is one
of the payments man has to make for living an
unnatural life. And doctors pay just as much—or
nearly as much —as others... .P.R.0.: An anaemic
little thing; but there’s some music in it. Try
again.... Alfred J.: Is it intended to be a poem or a
puzzle? T.W. (Lismore): But is there so much
wrong with the present system? Don’t forget that
if the Commonwealth Line carries your goods at cost
price, you will have to pay more than you do at
present (the Line being run at a heavy loss), and
that it is often only because products are sold at
a high price here that we are in a position to
market the surplus—sugar, for instance —abroad.
In short, the thing to aim at is not marketing
abroad (which is always liable to be unsatisfactory)
but marketing at home... .W.E.D.: R. S. Ross
handled him effectively two or three months ago
Barrowman: Push off; you’re hawking very old
wares ...H.H.H.: Adelaide has facilities for crema-
tion, and so has Melbourne. The Sydney Crema-
torium, set in a garden at Rookwood, should have
been ready by now, but has been delayed through
trouble with a contractor; but it is on the point of
completion... .Present Sir: It falls to pieces in the
last verse. Get to work on it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.R.C.: Your election cartoon depicting the public
as a policeman stopping a politician from throwing
himself over the Gap rejected on principle J.J.:
The art looks hopeful; but cannibal humor is hard
to swallow these days A.S.: A hundred miles off
our beat. •. .W.F.W.: The shingle joke isn t a joke
and the drawing isn’t a drawing, except by courtesy.
A. Blobb: Take out the full stop H.W.8.:
Sorry, can’t offer any encouragement D. 8.: Looks
like an ectoplasmic emanation produced in a state
of trance... .H. 0.: Too foggy... .R.A.J.: Like the
person who named Bent-street, Sydney, you’re an
obvious humorist.... D.C. and R.C.8.: Only scratches.
“Billy See”: Speaking of the unmarried
mother and her disabilities, W.A. gives her
a flying start, anyway. The Kind Edward
Hospital at Subiaco accepts allcomers, pro-
vides a waiting- and resting-home, and sees
the new arrival landed, all inside the £5
baby bonus. And if the mother is hard up
they hand back thirty bob to buy the little
Groper some clothes.

“Caesar”: Here’s the reason why one
station-owner at Longreach (Q.) never gives
ihe weary pedestrian a lift. lie was driving
his car into town, when he overtook a tramp
and invited him to hop in. The swaggie did
so, and hopped out again to open the gates
along the road. On their arrival in town he
put in a claim for a half-day's wages as
gate-opener. The Court decided that the
claim was reasonable, and the squatter had
to pay.

“I’ervicnx”: “Sucre” (B. !)/4/’25) is un-
happy in his choice of a lawyer. A cheque
does not become a promissory note by reason
of being post-dated, although it becomes
liable in N.S.W. for ml valorem stamp duty
and in Victoria also if dated three weeks or
more ahead. If his lady customer gave him
a cheque for value received and tnere were
mi funds to meet it, she does become liable to
criminal prosecution—at least, in Victoria,
and the same law probably applies in N. S.
Wales.
* * * *
“The Traveller": If there is a truck-
shortage in the N.S.W. railways, as stated
by “Mick Anic” (B. 2/4/’25), let the heads
do as we did in Victoria. A year or two
ago there was a threatened scarcity of trucks.
Of the ordinary wheat-carrying vehicles there
are 15,000. One thousand were added to this
number by a stroke of the paint-brush. The
carrying capacity was altered from “Load
15 tons” to “Load 10 tons.” Hundreds of
other trucks were dealt with in the same
way. Decreasing the margin of safety V
Oh well, there you are! And, anyway, there
have been no serious accidents—-yet.
“Saddler’s Lament”: No need to say
“Cobbler, stick to your last”; most of ’em
have to. Look at the poor liarnessmakers.
Time was when the hands that made Tie
carriage harness for Potts Point and St.
Kilda were looked up to as artists. Yet the
best workman I ever met is to-day walking
the streets in idleness. In M.L. it is just
the same. A front-street city shop had
“Saddler” cut in the parapet under “1912.”
By degrees the proprietor introduced side-
lines to help business, until to-day he is all
side-lines and no _ saddler. The saddle-
making would be in danger of becoming a
lost art were it not for racing, polo and
the outer bush.

"Toby C.”: It looks as if this season’s
cotton crop in Queensland is going to pay a
good dividend—to the pickers. One active
young chap recently collected 31Glb. of cotton
in one day; another earned in the vicinity of
£5O in four weeks. As the average tally
pans out at about 255. a day, it is more than
likely that the union bosses will soon be
howling threats at an Arbitration Judge be-
cause the industry isn’t giving its employees
a living wage. With the assistance of my
wife and kids I spent most of the 1923-24
cotton season cultivating and tending a 25-
acre plot which didn’t produce enough cotton
to stuff the little mattress in the baby's
pram; but being a socialist—when I haven’t
anything—l regret that I’m not in the busi-
ness this season, just for the pleasure of
giving my pickers more than half this year's
crop to compensate the poor Ijeggars for what
they didn’t have the opportunity of earning
from me last year.
“Borom" : At the time of the introduction
of the Federal Amusement Tax, during the
war, there was a shortage in some parts of
small silver coins and copper; and when
a large travelling circus arrived in a N. S.
Wales Western town a financial genius saw
a chance of making money. Pie went round
to banks and business places and secured as
much of the small change as lie could get.
That night, when the circus opened, there
was confusion. People were clamoring for
tickets, and few of them had the exact
amount required, including tin' tax, while
the circus itself was in a similar fix. For
a time it looked as though the tickets would
have to be sold at the pre-tax rates, and the
tax paid later by the circus; but the smart
man approached the manager too soon, and
the circus dropped to the scheme. Instead of
purchasing the change, a telephone message
was sent to another town, 15 miles away,
and all the threepences, pennies and half-
pennies required were despatched by motor-
cyclist from there, arriving about half an
hour afterwards. The circus started that
night later than usual; but that didn’t matter
in the land of whips of time.
* * 7, *
“Bill o’ Costs”: The unscruoulous lady
who imposed upon “Sucre” (B. 9/4/’2s't
with a post-dated cheque, when she pos-
sessed neither funds nor any account with
any bank, seems to be only a cheeky variant
of. the old practitioners of the “false pro-
mise” (as to the future) as distinguished
from the “false pretence” (of an existing
fact). The former goes, penally speaking,
untouched; the latter may be rewarded with
an enforced rest in the most suitable home
for these impostors. It is difficult to legis-
late criminally against the false promiser,
since no one can say that he or she did not
intend to provide funds at the due time,
though investigation of facts may make sin-
cerity a strain on the imagination. The
practice of giving post-dated cheques varies
from unqualified imposture to the quite legi-
timate device of gaining a few days’ credit
with the consent of the creditor. The pun-
ishable offence that approaches nearest to
the false promise is that of “incurring a debt
without reasonable and probable expectation
of means of payment,” but that is only in
bankruptcy, and “Sucre” would have to force
the lady to “file her shovel” before starting
out in pursuit of his melancholy satisfaction.
All the same, there seems no good reason
why this should not be incorporated in the
general criminal law; for although you can’t
disprove an intention as to the future, you
can establish the absence of “reasonable ex-
pectation.” For instance, while it is impos-
sible to prove that Prime Minister Bruce
does not honestly intend to honor the bar-
gain with S.A. and start on the construc-
tion of the North-South railway, there is
pretty clear evidence that he has no reason-
able expectation of being allowed to do so
while his present party sits behind him.

Some of Australia's new foreign settlers
waste no time in seeking naturalisation and
adopting Anglicised names. One Demetrios
Efclides, of Bananaland, whose naturalisa-
tion was announced recently, advertises that
in future he will be Jim Euclid.
“To Po” : The fond mother of every second
kiddie in Victoria supplicates his school-
master to make him an electrical engineer.
Judging by the fact that Yallourn (Vic.),
an enormous concern, employs only three
full-blown electrical engineers, it looks as if
the rank and file can only become “wirers-
up” if they ever attain to anything.
“Coot” : Add to the roll of Crimean vete-
rans Captain George Wallace, who recently
returned, hale and hearty, to Williamstown
(Vic.) after an absence of 25 years. Born
on his father’s ship in the English Channel
on Christmas Eve, 1829, he followed the sea
for 70 years. Ilis first visit to Port Phillip
was in IS4B on board 11.M.5. Challenger.
During the Crimean War he served on
11.M.5. Ilodney, and when peace came joined
the s.s. Edina, then a troopship, and still
afloat in Hobson’s Bay.
Vic. is paying £455,000 a year in pensions
to former State employees. The taxpayer
has no hope of getting any relief as pension-
ers die out, for it is proposed to establish
a superannuation system. Calculations arc
being made with the view of showing that
the present burden is not likely to be in-
creased, inasmuch as existing pensioners, by
obligingly fading out, will make up the
State’s share of the expenditure on the
scheme now mooted. If the case can be
proved it may not be so difficult to persuade
the Conservative-Liberals to vote for the
Allan-Peacock bill.
The Australian cane-cutter begins to think
that he has achieved sensational wages only
to make soft jobs for Mediterranean new-
chums, who hardly speak his language and
don’t worship his industrial gods save as an
occasional matter of convenience. There-
fore, he demands that there shall be, for
the future, at least 75 Anglo-Australian cut-
ters for 25 assorted aliens; and there are
difficulties in the way. Italians in particular
have a habit of acquiring little farms and
settling down permanently alongside their
seasonal occupation : and, though it is fairly
easy to keep out' the strangers who arrive
by driblets, it is a different matter to uproot
large settled communities of them on no
charge save that of being persistent cane-
cutters.
“Sixenate”: In only two cases have I seen
a man actually “cut off with a shilling.” I
was with one of the scapegraces when, with
a hopeful heart, he opened his registered
letter. A mighty big one, it contained a
copy of his father’s will, which, after devot-
ing a whole sheet to a recital of the son’s
offences, devised to him the sum of one shil-
ling. To a covering letter was pinned a
postal note for the amount of the legacy. A
copy of the will was also sent, by direction,
to the other scapegrace, but it was a laconic
document, which merely said about him : “To
my son. . . .the sum of one shilling, which is
more than he deserves.” The reprobate, tak-
ing no sorrow' to his heart, wrote back
promptly asking where the the shilling
was.
“Rita C.”: When “7PN” (B. 26/2/’25)
ascribes the increase in wild dogs to the “hos-
tility” between employer and worker, he goes
out of his way to lay an unfounded charge
against the present-day station-hand. He
talks about “trappers and shooters realising
there will be big money in this business,”
oblivious of the fact, that, even in the days
when nearly every station-hand was an ex-
perienced bushman, a good dogger was one
of the hardest of all employees to secure. The
average station-hand of to-day wouldn’t earn
enough as a dogger to feed a canary. It
is between the Government and. the lessees
of Crown lands that the “unanimity of de-
termination” is needed; lack of co-operation
and too much unstocked and unoccupied
country are responsible for the increase in
all pests—four-footed ones, at any rate.
Vic. ex-Police Chief Tom O’Callaghan, who
became an octogenarian the other day, was
in his time one of the keenest detectives in
the force. Yet he was taken down 35 years
ago by a lad who pitched a tale that a
barefooted, sobbing girl alongside them had
lost half a crown. The kid, said the boy,
had been sent by her old woman —“a fair
terror”—on a message, and stopping for a
moment to look at an excavation “just in
front of yer,” had dropped the coin. “Wisht
I had ’alf a crown and I’d give if to the
pore kid.” added her champion. O’Callaghan
was touched, and parted. A fortnight later
he was passing another excavation near Mel-
bourne Hospital, when he spotted the girl,
again sobbing, and heard the same yarn re-
lated by the lad. O'Callaghan made no
arrest, but he used some scorching words
which, he hopes, caused the pair to think
of another one. He retired 13 years ago.
and there is every indication that he will
continue to draw his pension of six hundred-
odd a year for another decade or so.
“Canar” in a dead friend’s defence:
As one who knew the late John Scott (“Wee
Bobbie” of The Bulletin) for a long time, I would
like to correct an impression that his tragic end
in the Solomons recently was brought about by his
ill-treatment of natives on the plantation of which
he was manager. According to some of the evi-
dence reported in the Sydney papers, Scott was
cruel to a native laborer who, in order to protect
his own life, struck at him with a grass-knife and
inflicted wounds which caused Scott’s death. Apart
from the fact that nobody who knew the dead man
would believe that he had been guilty of treating
natives cruelly, no one who has had experience
of the “boys” in the district will swallow the
murderer’s yarn that it was necessary for him
almost to cut off his white boss’s head to save his
own life. Of late the natives of the Mandated
Territories have learned that the surest and quickest
way to get a white man into trouble with the
authorities is to accuse him of having ill-treated
them. Since they discovered this there have been
more complaints of assaults and beatings from them
in a month than in a couple of years of the old
days—before it was the custom to accept the evidence
of natives in preference to that of white men. Far
more likely is it that Scott was the victim of one
of the uncontrollable spasms of blood-lust which
seize the Pacific Islander and urge him to kill
whatever is in sight—the Pacific equivalent to the
Malayan amok —and that the accusations of cruelty
were simply what might have been expected in the
circumstances.

“I am an aged widow, 79 years

a severe fall while carrying a sauce-

of bacon. I had taken out the meat
and was taking the saucepan out-
side to cool, when near the door
the cat rushed in and ran under
my feet. As I had hold of the sauce-
pan with both hands, I could not
save myself from falling, and the
broth severely scalded one of my
hands. The fall gave me a great
shaking. I was alone in the house
at the time, and as I live in the

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU that love to haunt the city,
You that dwell and have your being
Where so much of pain and pity
Evermore awaits your seeing,
You that wander weary-footed
Crowded streets and teeming alleys,
Have you never heard the Green Man
Singing in his hills and valleys?
Do you ever dream you knew him
Once of old when earth was younger?
And that now, if you pursue him,
You shall half appease the hunger—
Thirst for gold with you abiding—
Half forget the ache and fretting
That, alas, are with you always
From the sun’s rise to its setting?
Hearken! ’Tis the Green Man calling!
Who is lie that will not listen?
Is his voice not like the falling
Of far waters, streams that glisten,
Growing mist-like, growing veil-like.
While rich rainbow ribands wreathe them,
O’er cliff-faces, grey cliff-faces,
To cool fronded depths beneath them!
Listen! ’Tis the Green Man singing.
Listen one and all together !
Does it sound not like the swinging
And the tossing in blithe weather
Of tall trees with massy leafage
And young saplings, bronzed and sappy,
When the skies are blue and cloudless.
And a soft wind makes them happy?
Night and morning he rejoices,
Never muted, never lonely ;
All wood-voices, water-voices
Arc the Green Man’s music only.
If you’d find him, if you’d hear him,
Go a-roving, go a-elimbing;
Hearken to the magpie’s warbling.
Listen to the bell-bird’s chiming.
Though from task to task the city
With his tyrant-scourge compels you
To drag onward, without pitv.
Listen —this the Green Man tells you.
“Follow, follow.” says the Green Man,
“Quit your crowded streets and alleys;
Seek my magic of the forests,
Drink my balsam of the valleys!”

RODERIC QUINN.
A Sea Change.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STANCHION spent another hopeless
morning about the waterfront. When
he came to the Far East Line wliaff he
watched the loading of the great steamer
which was berthed there. The rattle of
winches had just broken out anew as the
’longshoremen turned-to after their mid-day
meal. Stanchion was glad, because the sight
of their open lunch-tins had aggravated his
hunger until it became a pain of the flesh
not easily to be endured.
Along the wharf came the Chief Officer,
looking very spick and span, to see how the
painting of the ship’s side advanced.
Then Stanchion felt the bitter flood-tide of
his misery rush in upon him. A month ago
he, too, had been a ship’s officer, just as trim
and authoritative as this one. Now, stranded
on the leeshore of adversity, lie would have
been thankful to have joined those sailors
upon the stage. That was the most he could
expect: a seaman’s berth. And the search
for even that much was proving long and
disheartening. Yesterday he had asked this
same officer for a job, and the reply had been
a slow shake of the head—nothing more.
Maybe if he had told that it was the unfor-
tunate ex-mate of the Patmos who was the
suppliant, and had recounted the story of his
fall from his high estate, he might have
excited the other’s pity. But, despite his
want, Stanchion could not attempt to evoke
in a fellow-craftsman the freemasonry of the
seas.
After all the pains and perils of his noviti-
ate, the keen endeavor to master the tech-
nique of his craft, and when he was ready to
step into a command there had come this
proscription, making him less than the
humblest seaman. He thought bitterly about
the sentence of the Admiralty Court, ob-
sessed by the idea that it had been morally
wrong in its finding. A doctor of medicine,
he reflected, might make a mistake, even a
fatal mistake, or a lawyer show ineptitude,
and escape punishment; but the seaman was
allowed no margin of error. Like his uten-
sils of navigation, he must be unerring. So
his certificate had been suspended for two
years because he had held to a wrong course
given him by a drunken captain !
At last he turned his back upon the ships,
and walked wearily towards the city, until
he came to the great arterv into which flowed
the tributary streams of traffic from the
wharves and the warehouse district. The
stream of heavy lorries was stopped to per-
mit the passage of a motor-ambulance, and
then rolled in again noisily. A knot of men,
looking after the fast-disappearing waggon,
stood upon the footpath, near where he
waited.
Weakened by lack of nourishment, he
swayed giddily beneath the burning sun, and
then, before he was conscious of what he did,
bent down and picked up a thin leather
pocket-book that lay at his feet, and slipped
it into his pocket.
Crossing the road he entered the lower
reaches of the city, turned into a dismal side-
street. and reached the apartment-house that
gave him a squalid home. He stretched him-
self upon his bed and lay inert there for a
little while; then he drew out the pocket-
book and removed its contents. They proved
to be Board of Trade Certificates of Com-
petency for all Grades to Master issued to
John Rendover, and many discharges in the
same name. There was also a photographic
reproduction of a party of merchant-service
officers and seamen that had been cut from
an illustrated periodical. Beneath the picture
was printed “The men who saved the crew
of the Mogador,” and below that again the
name of each individual. “J. Rendover, 3rd
Mate,” caught Stanchion’s eye, and, locating
the officer indicated, he w r as surprised to
observe the resemblance to himself.
He wondered languidly how he could re-
turn the pocket-book to its owner. Die
shipping-office or a police-station? What it
the officer’s ship was about to sail? _ He d
have to go at once! But when lie tried to
rouse himself from his lethargy his weakness
overcame him. and he sank upon the bed and
drifted into sleep. #
It was night when the opening of his door
awakened him. He heard the voice of the
big Norwegian sailor who had the next
room.
"Dase sliippen hunds vor das I-talian
steamer to-morrow. Come down wis me in
morning we gittas yob,” said the kindly
Norseman.
“Right you are, Eric,” Stanchion drawled
sleepily. “Put the gas on. will you? What
Italian steamer’s that? The Garibaldino?”
“Yas. Dasa one. I bane on Dago ship
once. Day iss nigger-drivers, day iss. But
day ant no odder ships vots vonting hunds.”
Then looking at Stanchion’s pinched face he
continued: “You vas hongry, Bill? Come
out and has feed at Tony’s. I has fife shil-
lings. Sing out ven you vas raddy.”
As Stanchion sat on the edge of his bed
and groped for his boots, he picked up the
evening paper the sailor had left. A para-
graph on the first page drove the last ves-.
tiges of sleep from his eyes. He read: —
A man crossing South-street to-day was knocked
down by a motor-lorry and killed instantly. He
was evidently a seafaring man and had “J.R.” tattooed
upon his left arm. The police state that he has
been observed under the influence of drink for
several weeks, and it is alleged that he was drunk
at tile time of the accident. From papers found
upon the deceased his name is believed to be John
Rendover, but no further particulars can, be found
concerning him.
Stanchion tore out the news item, and
slipped it into the dead man’s pocket-book.
Then going to his sea-chest, with the intent-
ness of a man who has decided upon a new
course of action, he locked up the leather
case with his possessions. “Well, he won’t
want his ticket now, poor devil,” he mur-
mured, and his brain began to teem with
the idea that had possessed it.
The next morning he and the Norwegian
signed on as firemen on the Garibaldino,
there being no seamen’s berths available.
During that trip to the Mediterranean he
never shaved, and when he was paid off in
Naples wore a trim navy beard.
In port lay the British steamer Dion
Heart, cleared for the River Plate, but await-
ing a successor to fill the vacant berth of
the second mate. Stanchion, using Rend-
over’s papers, was engaged, and the captain
thus saved the delay of having a substitute
sent from England.
The Lion Heart was a happy ship, fore
and aft. There was good fellowship in the
officers’ messroom, and a spirit of cheerful-
ness pervaded the fo’c’s’le. The captain
was a fine seaman, and everything went well
with Stanchion until the day the Lion Heart
docked in the Thames to load general cargo
for Australian ports. He had spent fourteen
contented months aboard the vessel; and
any fears of the discovery of his imposture
had long since ceased to trouble him. And
now suddenly he felt that the tangle of his
own weaving was closing in upon him. He
was dressing to go ashore when he heard,
tlirough the open porthole of his cabin, the
sound of voices. Glancing through the port-
hole he saw that Mason, the first mate, was
close to his cabin in conversation with an
officer from the Australian liner Neutral Bay,
which lay astern.
“And who’s your second mate, George?”
asked the stranger.
“Name of Rendover. Quiet, decent cove,
replied Mason.
“Rendover? Rendover} Front name’s not
Jack, is it? It is? Belongs to Melbourne?”
“Yes, that’s the chap,” said the genial
Mason.
“Boozes a good bit?”
“No. Never heard of him touching a drop.
We stocked up with rum in the West Indies,
but he never bought a thimble-full. Decent
chap; knows his job. The Old Man thinks
the world of him.”
“H’m! Oh, well, it can’t be the same
fellow.” The stranger rubbed his nose
thoughtfully, then said: “Uncommon name,
though. Is he hot stuff with the women?”
“No,” Mason rejoined stoutly; “I can
vouch for that. I’ve been ashore with him
too often not to know that. But why so
interested in the second, son ? Do you know
him ?”
“No, but my missus lives next door to a
Mrs. Rendover in Melbourne. She’s lost all
trace of her husband —hasn’t seen him for
about seven years. My missus’s always ask-
ing me to keep a weather eye lifting for him.
Your second doesn’t seem to tally in some
respects with the cove, but I’d like to put
the parallel-rule over him. Is he aboard
now, George?”
“No. He went ashore,” replied the mate
shortly.
The moment the deck was clear Stanchion
made his way down the gangway. He re-
turned to the ship at 2 o’clock the next
morning, worn-out bodily from aimless
tramping; wild-eyed from the haunting fear
tli at possessed him.
The Neutral Bay went down the river
next morning outward-bound for Australia,
and Stanchion gazed after her with a heart
as heavy as the pall of leaden sky that hung
above the Thames.
“He’ll blab. I know his sort. Always
making trouble,” Stanchion muttered with
trembling lips as he watched the liner thread-
ing her way down-stream.
A fortnight later the Lion Heart set out
on her voyage to Australia, and every day
of the trip was a torture to the second mate.
He thought of deserting at Capetown and
again at Fremantle, and then decided he
would disappear at Adelaide.
No sooner had the Lion Heart made fast
at Port Adelaide than a sharp-featured
woman came aboard; and Stanchion grasped
tlie main-deck railing when he heard a high-
pitched voice asking: “Is Mr. Rendover
aboard?”
Her keen glances darted about the deck,
and before the captain could point to where
Stanchion leaned across the rail, she had
seen him and was walking hastily towards
the. man she thought her husband.
“Oh, you’ve come back, Jack!” she cried
in a quavering treble.
Stanchion said nothing, and. eluding her
piercing brown eyes, stared helplessly at
the roof of the wharf building.

THE PENALTY OF OVERWORK
Many People are Beginning to Feel the Strain
The heavy tax of overwork, the extra strain so
necessary to many trades and occupations, is hard
on the kidneys. The kidneys fail in their work
and the poisonous matter collects in the system.
If your work seems hard for you, if you have a
lame, weak or aching back, if you seem tired and
listless, if you notice sediment in the urine,
unnatural color, or irregular passages, and seem
to be running down without apparent cause, begin
at once with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, the
remedy that has proved so beneficial to your
neighbors. It has brought strength to the backs
of thousands of working men and women. Sydney
proof is given here.
A MAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mr. W. H. Trott, “Fail-view,” Gannon Street, Tempe,
Sydney, says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal
from backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when 1
stooped. One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recom-
mended to me, so I bought some and they worked wonders.
After taking a few doses I felt much better, so I continued
with the treatment for a few weeks, and I am glad to say
they drove the pain out of my back and made me feel
splendid. Two years have elapsed since then, and I am still
tree of backache, but I keep Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills by
me, and take a dose or so whenever T feel a little off color,
and they always do me good.”
Twelve years later, Mr. Trott says: “Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills cured me of backache .14 years ago. and I am
still free from this trying complaint.”

A WOMAN’S TESTIMONY.
Mrs. Emily Osborne, 5 Queen Street, Petersham. Sydney,
says: ‘‘Some years ago I had a very bad attack of disordered
kidneys, and, as a result suffered agony from backache and
rheumatic pains all over my body. I was often so bad that
I could hardly get about the house, every movement giving me
increased pain. My rest at night was very disturbed, as it was
impossible for me to lie in one position for any length of time,
owing to the nagging pain in my back. My ankles and arms
swelled a good deal, and were very painful if I touched them.
1 had no energy for anything, and was really far from well.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were recommended to me, and
after taking a course of these grand Pills I was completely
cured.”
Ten years later, Mrs. Osborne says: “Ten years have
elapsed since Doan's Backache Kidney Pills cured me. and I
am still well, a fact that speaks volumes for this splendid
remedy.”

“When she comes near,” he thought, “she 11
see I’m an impostor, and then there 11 be
hell to pay!”
Her hand was on his arm now, and she
was saying: “You won’t go away again,
Jack, will you? I’ve got a boarding-house
at St. Kilda —it will keep us both if you
want to give up the sea. I just couldn’t
wait, so I came on here to meet you. You
haven’t changed a bit, Jack. I would have
known you anywhere, in spite of the beard.”
Stanchion felt a short-lived relief which
fled before the panic shout that began to
clamor in his brain: “But your voice—your
voice will betray you. It’s no use trying
to keep the pretence up any longer. Speak
and have done with it!”
But he found he could not speak.
“Why don’t you answer me, Jack?”
“I —-I don’t know what to say,” he stam-
mered, and to his surprise and joy the woman
did not appear to notice any strangeness
in his speech. He began to feel more secure.
“Never mind, I’ll forgive everything. It
was my fault, too. But promise me you’ll
come back,” she purred.
He cast about in the confusion of his mind
for some comforting words that, might send
her ashore satisfied; but lie was entirely
without resource in dealing with women, and
feared he might, by some maladroit utter-
ance, lose the ground he had already gained.
Suddenly she put her arms around his
neck. Her thin, angular face came very
close to his. The hard line of the mouth
relaxed into a tremulous softness, and the
brown eyes widened and took on an eager
brightness.
In full noontide upon the deck of the ship
he had grown to love, in full sight of his
commander, his comrades and liis subordi-
nates, he recoiled from the lavish manifesta-
tion of this unsought passion. “Look here,”
he exclaimed, “I’m not your husband.”
“Oh, yes, you are !” she blazed. “And I’ve
got you now !” Then she choked down her
anger, and coming close to. Stanchion began
to plead again.
He retreated a step, and liis eyes swept
the deck wildly. He saw that the captain
and the mate were silently regarding tin'
episode, and that a party of the crew had
suspended the coiling of a hawser to look
on. He had seeu a water policeman stand-
ing at ease upon the wharf, and knew that
if he persisted in his denial the law would
punish liis crime of impersonation. He was
aware that he had only to utter a few con-
ciliatory words and the danger would be
averted; but, unacquainted with feminine
moods, lie had no knowledge of the cozening
word.
Again the outstretched arms attempted Jo
encompass him.
Anything but that! Discovery, condem-
nation —anything but those lean arms that
would fetter him to an unthinkable mesal-
liance.
“No, no! I tell you no!” he cried. “I
tell you I’in not your husband.”
With the fury of a woman scorned she
struck at him. and then, turning wildly to-
ward the captain and mate, launched a
tumult of hysterical cries.
The captain came forward reluctantly! a
puzzled expression upon his red face.
“He denies that he’s married to me !” Her
voice rose until it was almost a shriek. “He’s
trying to fool me again !’’
“Well, well,” stammered the captain.
“Very strange, ma’am. Now, wlio’d ha’
thought it? Flow’s this, Mr. Rendover?”
Stanchion drew a pocket-book from his
uniform jacket, and took from it a press
cutting.
“Read that, sir,” he said between set lips,
When the captain had raised his aston-
ished face from the little square of printed
paper he heard his second mate say very
quietly:
"My name is Mark Stanchion. I was
suspended—as I think, unjustly—for my
share in the loss of the Patmos. You may
remember the case, sir. I found the poeket-
hook witli Rendover’s certificate just after
he’d been killed in a street accident. That’s
all I have to say, Captain Slade.”
And the man whom the master of the Lion
Heart held up to brother-captains as the
ideal second mate walked unfalteringly to
his cabin, though his world fell from under
his feet.
EDWARD SCOTT HOLLAND.
Three Days' Rain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I HAD never seen Harry .Taffray look so
serious as when he spoke of the three
flays’ rain. At first I thought he was
joking as usual, but I soon changed my mind.
After all, I remembered that there were some
extensive chasms in my knowledge of Harry.
I had known him only a few months, and
had no idea where he had come from, nor
how long he had been barman-rouseabout of
the pub at Boganbong.
Harry was a tall, loose-jointed, handsome
fellow, with one of those quiet voices which,
cultured or not, at least seem so, and he
was so typically the barman-rouseabout of
the typical bush shanty that he might have
been anything on earth. This fact was evi-
dently felt by the Yankee engineer, Jackson
Y. Washington, when he suggested that
Harry might not alwmys have been a bar-
man.
Jackson Y., by the way, was not a bad
sort, apart from a slight tendency to exag-
gerated speech and an annoying habit of
trying to anticipate everything one was about
to say. He was in charge of the oil-boring
operations at Slippery Dip, a queer spot
where the road was perpetually greasy. This
greasiness was locally believed to prove the
presence of petroleum, and Jackson Y., for
reasons of his own, had supported the belief:
“Why,” he once declared, “on one of our
oilfields down on the Mexican coast there’s
a little patch of ground, coupla million acres
maybe, and it’s so goldarn greasy that a
whole gavernorting revolution once slipped
clean off it into the sea.”
These enthusiasms of phrase would fre-
quently cause Harry Jaffray to climb one
rung higher, and it was this which made me
assume that he was joking when he first
spoke of the three days’ rain.
ll came about quite casually. In the
spacious ten-by-ten dining-hall of the Hotel
Boganbong one evening Jackson Y. remarked:
"I reckon Mr. Jaffray must have been some-
thing vurry different from a saloon-tender
in his time.” Later on. in the bar, I re-
ported to Harry: “Mr. Washington here
reckons you’ve been something vurry different
from a barman in your time, Harry.”
“Sure!” confirmed Jackson Y. “I once
worked with a chap, quiet chap like you, on
the Mexican oilfields. I thought he wasn’t
quite ordinary, and blowed if the gavernort-
ing coot didn’t turn out to be a prince
incog.”
We all expected Harry to confess that
actually he was an emperor out of cog. In-
stead liis gaze became dreamy and strangely
serious as he replied:
“As a matter of fact, Mr. Washington, if
it hadn’t been for the worst run of luck you
ever saw I’d be steering a Rolls-Royce now
instead of a beer-tap. It’s the old story—-
drought. Though it wasn't really the drought.
I had pulled through three years of it. Then
came rain—three days’ rain ; steady tropical
rain ; warm monsoon rain. For those three
days I just watched it coining down. Then
on the fourth morning the sun blazed out
once more. I just packed a swag and gave
up, a broken man. It was hell —to pull
through three years of it and then have to
give in.”
Harry was so manifestly sincere that I
discarded my last rag of suspicion that he
was joking. In his eyes was the look of a
man who had fought for a dream —fought
against unimaginable odds, and fought in
vain.
“Floods, I guess!” suggested Jackson Y.
sympathetically, voicing the general assump-
tion.
"No,” replied Harry, and went on to ex-
plain : “it was out Boulia way in Queens-
land. Wonderful country thereabouts. Hot
—l’ve seen it 130 in the shade there. But
great grazing land. If I’d been able to pull
through I’d have been a made man within
a year. It was heart-breaking, I tell you.”
Jackson Y.’s irritating habit intruded:
“Foreclosed on the gavernorting mortgage,
eh?” Harry shook his head dreamily, and
was about to continue, when Jackson Y.
butted in with another guess: “I get you,
boy ! Seen the same thing down in Texas.
Dry spell... .good rain.... and the whole
country covered with poison weed. I've
seen three million cattle lying dead at once,
bodies all swelling up and bursting. Going
off pop so loud and numerous you could
hardly hear whether it was yesterday or to-
morrow. That was down on the Maxican
border. The sheriff from El Paso came gal-
loping out to put a stop to it—thought it
was some gavernorting revolution had strayed
over the border.”
“No, Mr. Washington,” replied Harry
patiently, “it wasn’t that, though, mind you,
I have seen poison weed spring up from
nowhere. No, it was the rain, as I said.
You know the way it comes down at times.”
That was addressed to the general com-
pany, and we nodded, but once more Jackson
Y. knew all about it: “Bet your life, boy!
I know. Started all right and got colder
and colder. Developed into a blizzard. Killed
every solitary animal. Talk about frozen
mutton!”
Harry did not seem to notice the remark,
lie had lapsed into an absent-minded mood,
and stood seemingly unconscious of our pres-
ence, a faraway look in his eyes as though
he was once again watching the hoofs of
disaster trampling his hopes.
Needless to say it was Jackson Y. who
jolted him out of the reverie: “Vurry bad
luck, Mr. Jaffray, to strike a gavernorting
blizzard like that.”
“Not on your life!” exclaimed Harry sud-
denly. “We don’t have blizzards up Poulin
way. Boulia’s hot; hottest place this side
of Hell, and even that’s a bit cooler. lie-
sides, didn’t I tell you it was warm rain,
tropical rain? No, the trouble was that the
drought just didn’t break. Even after those
three days’ steady downpour the ground was
as parched and cracked as ever. Broke iny
heart completely.”
I felt inclined to deal some silence out to
Jackson Y. with a bottle as he once moiv
interrupted: “Seen it that way down in
Colorado. A dry spell there makes cracks
bigger ’n the Grand Canyon. I’ve seen whole
thunderstorms disappear down them cracks
without wetting the sides.”
“Very likely,” responded Harry, with obvi-
ous impatience. “But that was not the
trouble up Boulia way. If you wouldn’t in-
terrupt I’d tell you. Lord knows it isn’t
often I grouch. Pact, is this is the first time
I’ve ever spoken to a soul about the affair
since I strapped my swag and rode away
through the heat. I’ll never forget that heat.
Suffocating—the three days’ rain had made it
hotter than ever; a steamy sort of heat! It
had been hot enough before the rain started;
hot for weeks, months. We thought the
rain ’d cool it down. We watched, three
days and nights. But it was warm rain,
and it grew warmer. That was the tragedy
of it. It was so hot that it never reached
the ground. By the time it had fallen to
somewhere about the tree-tops it began to
boil and went up again in steam. A vurry
steamy climate. Mr. Washington.”

The Invisible Cloak.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
What is there left for the poor soul to wear?
The body goes in gold and silver thread.
It decks itself in colors ruby-red ;
It makes itself immaculately fair.
What has the soul left but the wandering air’
I weave myself, in some diviner dread,
A cloak as magic as the taste of bread.
As light as laughter, love-leaves in my hair.
Yet when I die and go to Paradise.
I know the saints will leave their busy
wheels
Crying “Oh look, she has brought back the
sea,
The sun, the stars, and earth’s old happy
skies!”
And I shall smile when some young angel
kneels. ...
This cloak I shall put on, friends, presently
