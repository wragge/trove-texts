“THE BULLETIN.”
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis
tindive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Ausuiaiia for the Australians. —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded.
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System-one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole
country voting as one Constituency,
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains,
or.a has become a vast property, because it pos-
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now aiflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the peonle over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected, with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that' so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maonland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently reraailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

A FATAL FASCINATION.
"On Sunday afternoon Cardinal Moran referred to the wave of depression which, he said, they all regretted had swept over their own and the neighbouring provinces.
There were lessons which their present experience tanght and which he trusted would be taken to heart by the Government and by the people. This vice of gambling had
spread like some dread epidemic throughout the length and land, and he would rejoice to see some crusade started winch would have the effect of checking its
growth and finally rooting it out altogether."

Let us Kill Somebody.
In an issue of St. James’ Gazette, which
reached us by last mail, there appears an
interesting letter from that accustomed cor-
respondent who rises at intervals to ask why
Australia should not take a hand in the
military service of the Empire, and share
the glories of the tented field with the full-
blown private of Britain. There is a sad,
depressing sameness about that corres-
pondent, inasmuch as he always assumes in
a certain irresponsible manner that is all his
own—(1) That Australia has no voice in the
matter, and that it is only necessary for the
British war department to decide that
certain troops ought to be “raised” in this
country, and they shall be raised accordingly;
and (2) that Australia doesn’t want any
voice in the matter, but would rush wildly
to seize the opportunity by the forelock. “It
is a fine day,” says the military Briton, in
effect ; “ let us go out and kill somebody
and then in a sudden accession of cordiality
he offers to take the Australian out with
him so that the latter can kill somebody too.
The idea that the offer might be refused—
that the Australian might not want to kill
anybody at present, except perhaps his own
aborigine—never enters into the calculation.
In this respect the warlike Briton very much
resembles the courteous cannibal gentleman
with nothing on, who offers his visitor the
first drink of blood out of the butchered
preacher—neither ever considers the pos-
sibility that the blood might not be
appreciated.
* * *
The British army, as pointed out by the
correspondent of St. James Gazette, suffers
from a perennial scarcity of recruits. The
pay is so utterly wretched, the victuals so
infamous, the prospects of promotion are so
scarce and the prospects of dying in the
workhouse in later life so plentiful, the
insults from ignorant and asinine officers are
so regular, and the swindle is so reliable -
for the British Government hires its red-
coated hero at a wage of Is. per day and
“everything found," and then it charges
him for his clothes, medical attendance,
hair-cutting, use of library, damages to
barracks, a great part of his food, and other
sundries till his alleged pay is almost entirely
vanished - that soldiers arc practically un-
procurable. Out of a nation of 38,000,000
warlike souls an army 210.000 strong is
maintained with the utmost difficulty. The
majority of the recruits consist of stunted
youths under 20 years of age—youths of
the gin and short-pipe variety who have a
father in gaol, and an uncle in the lunatic
asylum, and a mother who is an incurable
dipsomaniac—and of these 4000 desert
annually, and over 10,000 are court-mar-
tialled. Therefore the British army is in a
bad way, especially that part of it which is
stationed in the unhealthy regions of India,
and the addition of a few new battalions is
urgently wanted. Australia is to supply
these battalions, and how she is to do it is as
follows :
I venture to submit for consideration the desirability
of raising three battalions of infantry in Australia for ser-
' ice in India. I believe that the more populous colonies
could easily furnish the men for them, and that
it would be greatly to their advantage to do so. To put
the matter as clearly as possible, £ will summarise the
advantages which I believe that the adoption of this pro-
posal would carry, (a) Three battalions of British in-
fantry could be withdrawn from India, thus restoring the
balance to a great extent ;(6) India would be strengthened
b\ three battalions of men already inured to a hot
climate ; (c) the Australian colonies would in a short time
possess a reserve of men who have received the best
possible military training ; (rf) a close connection between
Australia and India would be established ; (<■) the great
chain of mutual support and assistance which should exist
between the mother country and the colonies would be
strengthened and developed ; (/) lastly, a considerable
relief would be afforded to the annual task of the
Inspector-General of Recruiting. In answer to a possible
objection, it might be well to state that the three Austra-
lian battalions are only proposed to meet part of the
double battalion difficulty. The preponderance in num-
ber of those abroad is six, and not three. It is, how-
ever, hoped that in time the additional battalions now
required in Egypt may be withdrawn, and then
India alone would upset the balance. Consequently the
Austiahan battalions would restore it as far as need be.
The officering and recruiting of these battalions would, it
is believed be easy. Australia has its labour question and
* ' lnen ?P‘dyed, even as England has ; and the experience
of .Suakim leads us to think that there is a strong military
spirit in Englishmen of the colonies as well as in those at
home. The conditions of service, rates of pay, &c,,
shnidd be precisely the same in the Australian as in the
British infantry battalions. The senior officers would, at
toe first, have to be selected carefully from the British
army ; but all the subalterns should be Australian gentle-
**2? n . > am l after a few years there would be no more
efficient and genuinely territorial regiments than those
furnished by Australia,
* * *
As regards the advantages set forth in the
above list the majority can be dismissed in a
sentence. Ihe fact that three battalions of
British troops can be withdrawn from India,
provided an Australian force will take their
place, is of no more importance to us than
the fact that three battalions of Chinese
might be withdrawn from Corea under the
some conditions. The circumstance that
India would be “strengthened ” under these
circumstances is probable, but eminently un-
interesting-—Gehenna would be strengthened,
for that matter, if the three battalions wont
the) e, but that also is not a thrilling
consideration. After this comes the state-
ment that “a close connection between
Australia and India would be established,”
but no one wants that connection, and it we
had it, it is neither eatable nor drinkable
nor capable of being put up the spout, and
beyond the fact that the connection might
lead to cholera, and that it certainly
would lead to hobnail liver and parch-
ment kidney, there are no apparent results
in sight anywhere. The remark about the
chain of mutual support and assist-
ance ” is eloquent, but unsatisfactory and
meaningless, and the “annual task of the
Inspector-General of Recruiting” is dis-
tinctly “not our funeral.” All these
things may be reasons why England should
want troops, but they arc no earthly
reason why Australia should supply them.
The fact that England wants soldiers is in
itself by no means surprising. Every country
wants something, and most of them want
everything, and nearly every separate in-
habitant in each country wants the earth.
* * #
In addition to all these inducements, more-
over, the Australians are to enjoy “ the same
conditions of service, rates of pay,” etc., as
the ordinary British infantry-man now
wallows in. This is about as great an in-
ducement as if we were assured that the
Australian trooper would be disembowelled
and then guillotined. 1 hat warrior, in the
Soudan Contingent days, got 355. per week
as his minimum wage, and travelled in a
first-class steamer, and was victualled after
the fashion that prevails in an expensive
hotel. He carried wine and potted tongue
and bloater-paste and jelly along with him
in huge quantities—there was so much wine,
in fact, that even the dry Contingent couldn’t
finish it, and the last of it was only got rid
of the other day, when it was despatched to
the big New South Walesßenevolent Asylum.
And now this same individual is offered—as
a special privilege—the chance of enlisting
at Is. per diem, and being defrauded out of
eightpence, of wearing a glaring red coat,
and a hard, prickly shirt, and misfit boots,
of meeting with cholera and cobras, and
getting a hideous liver complaint, of being
court-martialled, black-holed, subjected to
punishment-drill, and bossed by a variety of
pompous officers of all degrees, and of having
the blood of various niggers upon his soul—
if he has a soul, and going to Sheol-jf there
is a Sheol—when he dies, in consequence.
And, further, the subalterns of the new force
are to be “exclusively Australian gentle-
men the sons of the Old Colonial Gentry*,
man, all of the present time ; and they will
return alter their term of service to be
incipient colonels in their native land, and
will be alluded to in the papers as “ military
authorities,” and will profess to regard
everything from a “ military standpoint,”
and clamour after fortifications and coinpul-
smy military service, and howl fur blood and
big guns whenever a shearers’ strike wants
suppressing, or a political demonstration
offends their sense of “ loyalty,” and move
that the legislative Assembly should be
abolished, and things be run on the good old
Indian plan, and when they get old and
apoplectic and red-nosed they will be
described as “veterans,” and bo a curse to
the country at large. For there is hardly a
curse among all the curses under Heaven
which can compare to that which descends
ffpoa the land that is full of “ veterans.”
The military hero who has been drilled
till he is a mere bumptious machine
upon two legs is a picturesque object, but all
the originality has been squeezed out of him
by his tight belt, and he is seldom of any use
afterwards—except for military purposes.
There have been hunchbacks and flabby fat
men among those who have done great deeds
in the ways of peace ; and dwarfs, and
knock-kneed individuals with one eye, and
persons with incurable bow-legs have left
their footprints on the sands of time ; but
the big, stalwart veteran in almost every
case is nothing but a veteran till the end.
• # #
The military device advanced by the St.
James’s Gazette might, as that paper states,
furnish this country with a “reserve of men
who have received the best possible military
training,” and the British correspondent
evidently regards this as an advantage which
cannot fail to be appreciated. Probably he
would be surprised to hear that what Aus-
tralia wants above all things is to avoid
getting such a reserve. In its own insane
fashion it wants to take its chance. A big
army leads to destruction and is the sure
road to ruin. It is used far more often to
crush the democracy at home than to stave
off enemies abroad, and if it gets big enough
it points the way inevitably either to despot-
ism or anarchy. It is the cause of foreign
war ; the majority of campaigns are begun
either because the army is discontented and
must be employed in bloodshed abroad
to postpone trouble at home, or because
some politician is longing for a light and the
existence of a military force gives him the
opportunity to gratify his longings, or
because the country next door is increasing
its army and it is advisable to suppress it
before the increase becomes too formidable,
or because the army is being enlarged, and
the adjacent nation takes the alarm and
declares war to prevent it getting larger. It
is an incubus that keeps on expanding,
because it is the business of each nation to
have a larger force than its neighbour, and
thus the evil has no end. And the experi-
ence of Europe has demonstrated that the
country which has a large force is attacked
much more frequently than that which has
a small one, for the existence of a powerful
military establishment is a challenge to every
adjacent State against which it could possibly
be used, and wars are undertaken quite as
frequently for the sake of wiping out the
aggressive battalions over the frontier as for
the acquisition of territory. Thus it is that
Norway, Sweden, Greece, Portugal, Spain
and Switzerland, with their mere skeleton
armies, stand peacefully outside the chaos of
European politics, while Austria, Germany,
Italy and France, with their armed millions,
live perpetually on the verge of a volcano.
Ibis world is a far more peaceful place
for non-aggressive nations, which attend
strictly to their own business, than the
Indian Office would tain have us
believe. There are even now in Europe
various little States that could barely put
one combatant in the field, which have
lived in comparative quietness for centuries,
and which promise to pursue the even tenor
of their way for centuries more. There is
no visible reason why Australia should not
do the same—so long as she abstains from
fooling with “ reserves,” and growing un-
necessary colonels and veterans and similar
munitions of war, all of which things lead to
disaster as certainly as sunrise leads to dav.
The man who lays in a gun as a peaceful
ornament is seized, sooner or later, with an
insane desire to tire it off and hear the
report. He may wait eighty years before
the madness comes upon him, but either to
him or his sons or his grandsons it inevitably
comes at last.
Boycotting and Intimidation.
Last week Chief Justice Darley, of New South
Wales, sitting in state with the tail of the dead
horse upon his cranium, gave judgment, with
huge costs, against Henry Scott Harden,
solicitor (“re a Gent., one”), whereby that
person is abolished in his legal capacity for one
year with costs, and is ordered after the expira-
tion of that period to remain abolished in-
definitely until these costs are paid in full. The
charge brought against Mr. Harden, and the
views of the Chief Justice thereon, arc fully
expressed in the judgment, as follows ;
The first finding was that the United Mercantile Asso-
ciation of Australasia was not a bona-fide company, a d
that the registering and the carrying on of the company's
business was to enable Hardkx, as solicitor, to mo er
costs for the collection of debts. The Frothonotai v led
found th t this was a mere sham company. The result of
'hat was that .Air. Hardkx for the purpose of gel in*
t >gether a large business—and it was a very large best
ness for so young a practitioner—falsely pretended that
there was such a company, and by this false pretence < b-
tained this large business. He put forth to the public
that there was s tch u company, when, q.s a matter
of fact, there was no such company at all—for he
was the company—and the public were induced to
1 ut this enormous business in the hands of such a young
I raotitioner believing that there was a strong cornnany
I eltind him, and thus the public entrusted him with bine
ness which he could not otherwise have obtained. Tney
found that in six months he issued no less than 300 writs
out of that court, and of these 254 were for sums under
£3O. It was quite true, fortunately, that the public had
not suffered, for the sums obtained from debtors wi re
duly handed over, so that there was no charge of mis-
appropriating against Mr. Hardkx. Taking everything
into consideration—the very large amount of costs which
he would have to pay—because they intended to imnf—
the whole of the costs on him - before he could nrarnif 0
ayam they thought the case would be met by susuenHß
jmn from practice for the term of one year. He vvoniS
have to pay the whole of the costs incurred by the
thonotary, including the shorthand-writer’s fees and n?’
cosls of the Incorporated Law Institute, and at the
of the 12 months he would be further suspended till n,
whole of the cosls were paid. That was to say l te wonm
not be allowed to practise again until the whole of n.o
costs were paid. 1116
* * #
Mr. Harden’s offence, as will be seen by tins
statement, consisted chiefly in the fact that he
was the United Mercantile Association, and the
Association was a concern which recovered
debts and did other legal work at an unusually
low rate—-therefore Mr. Harden committed the
brutal outrage of being a cheap lawyer. There
is no law in Australia to prohibit any man
calling himself an association or a company or a
bank or a joint-stock enterprise of almost any
sort, so long as his business is honestly con-
ducted. Also, there is very little law to
prevent him doing so when his business is dis-
honestly conducted. Almost every Hebraic
money-lender in Australia calls himself a bank
or a loan and finance corporation, and almost
every plain John Smith who opens an office
calls himself Smith & Co., or Smith Brothers
yet even Chief-Justice Harley raises no objec-
tion. Therefore, the United Mercantile
Association tvas no more bogus than the aver-
age, and it is a striking evidence of the rage
which fills the judicial soul at anybody who
cuts down the fees in the legal profession that
Sir Frederick Harley should denounce the
use of this absolutely harmless term as a “ false
pretence.” Moreover, his statement that by
this false pretence “ the public entrusted him
(Harden) with business which he could not
otherwise obtain,” is another surprising proof
of how the bench gets mad at the idea of cheap
law, for Chief-Justice Harley assuredly
couldn’t toll what business Harden would or
would not have been entrusted with, under
conditions that didn’t exist, any more than he
could tell what house would have fallen on him
under circumstances that didn’t happen, or
what would have become of him if his grand-
father hadn’t been born.
* • •
There was not even the slightest attempt
made to prove that anybody—except the guild
of lawyers—lost in any way by Harden’s pro-
ceedmgs, “The public,” as Judge HaliLEy
remarked, “ had not suffered, for the sums
obtained from debtors were duly handed over
so that there was no charge of misappropriating
against" the Unhappy “Gent, one.” These
remarks seem to imply that the Judge was
really surprised because there wasn’t a charge
of misappropriation in the bill, and that a
lawyer who would serve the public at low rates
was so very likely to embezzle his client’s cash
that it was necessary to mention publicly that
he hadn’t done it. At the same time, as nobody
had made the slightest suggestion of fraud, the
remark was altogether uncalled for. If Mr,
Harden or anybody else had risen up, ajmopos
of nothing in particular, and assured the audi-
ence that Chief Justice Harley had never in
all his life been guilty of bigamy or liogThievihg
that gentleman would undoubtedly have raised
Caln about this generous defence "of his charac-
ter. He would, in such a case, have probably
regarded the gratuitous statement that he
wasn t a hog-thief as containing an implication
that he looked very like one, and therefore it
was necessary to offer an explanation on the
subject, and his own superfluous explanation
about Mr. Harden carries precisely the same
construction. It suggested that a man who
furnished law below the usual tariff had neces-
sarily a hang-dog expression about him and was
capable of any enormity. Supplying cheap law
is a cardinal sin among lawyers, and it is
almost surprising that the Judge didn’t also
state that Mr. Harden hadn’t disembowelled
anybody and wasn’t suspected of arson.
* * #
The unfortunate “Gent., one,” being a
lawyer, is compelled to belong to a trades-
union, The trades-union of the law is the
most utterly tyrannous and unscrupulous one
upon the face of the earth. It allows of
no freedom of contract—therefore Harden,
being a lawyer, had to join it or lose his
means of livelihood. The unionist shearer
simply refuses to Work with the shearer who
accepts less than union- rates and does
not conform to union rules. The lawyer
compels other lawyers to belong to his
union, and if one of them shears his
client below the union tariff he not only
refuses to work with him but he hauls him
before a court, gets him fined an enormous sum
in costs, and obtains an order that he shall give
up work for a time—or, perhaps, for ever. If
the non-unionist lawyer is caught shearing a
client, after being convicted of working below
the fixed rates, he gets into other troubles
which may ultimately end in his being con-
signed to a gaol. \V hen the unionist shearer
attempts to coerce the non-unionist shearer into
obeying the rules of his association it is called
boycotting and intimidation and a brutal out-
rage upon the liberties of a free citizen ; when
he compels him to knock off work the troops
and Nordenfeldt guns are called out, and special
constables are enrolled, and there is a howl of
rage throughout the Tory press about the
animal selfishness of the working classes. If any
shearer had done, in the interests of his union,
what the law has just done for the sake of the
lawyers’ trade-union, he would have got three
years’ imprisonment at the very lowest estimate
—Judge Harley himself would probably have
given him seven. As for the idea of making
the non-unionist pay the expenses incurred in
boycotting and intimidating him that idea never
even dawned upon anybody outside the legal
profession—yet Judge Harley has ordered Mr.
Harden to pay costs, which will probably amount
to much over £lOOO, incurred in boycotting him,
and never even turned a hair in the process.
Why the whole legal system of the country
should be at the service of the lawyer to
enable him to enforce the rules of his miserable,
grasping union, while the Bench would have a
cataleptic fit if asked to lend a similar support
to the guild of shearers when it wants to sup-
press a blackleg, is still another mystery and
one that is too vast for present consideration.
* * #
It is a curious circumstance that the Chief


Justice seemed to regard Mr, Harden’s success
jn his profession as a personal injury, and as an
aggravation of his sins. He had “ a very large
business for so young a practitioner,” said Sir
Frederick in one place, and a moment later
he complained that “ the public were induced
to put this enormous business in the hands of
such a young practitioner,” Evidently the
feeling was that Mr. Harden was turning out
too much law per annum, and this was a grie-
vance which required to be stopped, lest prices
should go down. Now and then the collier
complains in like manner that certain mines are
turning out too much coal, and thereby reducing
prices, which, as the inevitable result, leads to
a, reduction of wages, and he also takes
measures to stop the same grievance. Then he
is described in the papers as a brutal ignoramus,
and troops and police are sent to run him
in lest he should burst into riot and
lead to destruction of property. Yet the
Chief Justice goes on exactly the same
track without arousing any military or other
interference, and the man Avho turned out too
much law is suspended for 12 months, in order
to keep up the price of law, and condemned to
pay costs. If the miners’ trades union, under
similar circumstances, ordered that the mine-
owner should be suspended for 12 months,
even without costs, to keep up the price of
fuel, all heaven and earth would not contain
the row that would ensue. Why all these
things are, The Bulletin does not attempt to
explain ; the one thing that is certain among
many uncertainties is that Mr. Harden comes
very badly out of the complication. The charge
against him is that he called himself an Associa-
tion —which is an act that is prohibited by no
statute now extant, that he was not so brutally
greedy as is required by the rules of the trades-
union, and that he was strictly honest in his deal-
ings with his clients ; and the sentence of the
court is that he shall be boycotted and intimi-
dated for the space of one year, that he shall
be prevented from following his lawful occupa-
tion ; and that he shall pay a colossal sum to
the people who boycotted and intimidated him.
All honest lawyers whose bills of costs aren’t
sufficiently exorbitant will do well to take
warning by this result. If they do not, a
Nemesis in horse-hair is upon their track.
Concerning Birth and Beer.
Lady Henry Somerset, a well-connected person
with a holy war-cry —“ no fallen women and no
drunkards ” —has climbed up her family tree to
make a few remarks on the modern manufac-
ture of nobility. Spake the haughty teeto-
talless
To-day the man who brewed the strongest XX, and the
gin-distiller who could place on the market more than
anybody else of a spirit he would probably never dare to
put on his own table—these men were raised to be the
perpetual legislators of the country. The British peerage
was becoming the British beerage (chestnut!), and what
used to be the blue blood of Verb de Ybre was changing
to the fiery liquid of Beer de Beer.
The noble philanthropist gives herself away in
the latter clause of her indictment. As long as
she sticks to the fact that the Queen delights
to exalt the fat trader who is remarkable for
ready cash, and that the grog-industry, being
based upon a world-tvide weakness, is one of
the most lucrative that an ordinary money-
maker can wallow in—as long as she confines
herself to this hideous truth, Lady Henry
Somerset is as right as right can be. But
when she commences to drivel concerning
the gore of the Veres de Vere and insinuates
that hereditary legislation should be the prero-
gative of families similar to her own, this
respectable woman becomes a dangerous
nuisance. If her blessed mission enables her to
obtain a respectful hearing for these painful
ideas on the peerage question, it were better
for the drunk and the fallen to fall and be
drunk as before without her noble interference.
The morality cause can dispense with her sup-
port on such terms. Democrat John Burns is
checking drunkenness and degradation by
exhorting his humble friends to wash their
faces and work steadily for a political system in
which the difference between a belted earl of
long descent and a brand-new bloated brewer
will be merely a historic conundrum. As a
crusader, Lady Somerset is of no more practical
benefit to mankind than Richard the First
was. In his early idiotic way the monarch
went to a lot of trouble to push Christianity.
Furthermore, he believed very hard in coming
over with the Conqueror and would have
spurned the thought of conferring a barony
upon the man who made his beer.
* * *
Lady Henry Somerset’s prattle is so essen-
tially the prattle of middle-class Toryism
(which loves the name of Nobility, but regrets
that it can’t all be ancient from the start) that
she is worth throwing a little ink at. More-
over, she happens, for a certain family reason,
to be a specially appropriate mark. Once again,
then, The Bulletin rises to mention that the
sinfulness of the Peerage as an institution is not
increased by the inclusion of a brewer any more
than it is i-educed by the ennobling of a Poet
Laureate. No man makes his own ancestor,
and the great-grandson of a virtuous genius is
no better qualified to be a power in the land
than the lineal descendant of an ill-conducted
pawnbroker. For founding an old family and
instigating a strain of blue blood a pawnbroker
does quite as well as anybody else. He is
neither better nor worse than a brewer, or a
brilliant field-marshal, or a Lord Chancellor.
■St. Leonards and the late noodle Cairns were
both of them heirs of lawyers who sat on the
woolsack. The one got into trouble for
assaulting a parlourmaid, and the other
achieved notoriety by jilting a chorus-girl
and being “pulled” for breach-of-promise.
It is fair to suppose that the eldest son of the
original Vere dh Vere (assuming the fact of
such a person having been) was not a stronger
argument in favour of “perpetual legislation
in Ins male line than his successor of to-day.
I’robably Vere de Vere No. 1 was a cut-
throat. Certainly he was an ignorant barbarian
as compared with a modern brewer, and why
his blood should have improved in 500 years
any more than Bung’s blood can improve in a
like period is a point which only the totally-
abstaining daughter-in-law of a duke can ex-
plain. And if both strains of blood get worse
as they grow blue the relative position of the
two ancestors remains as before- Lady Henry
Somerset is a genteel ass. The very name she
bears is a shocking reminder of the fact that if
“blood’’can claim to confer any sort of dis-
tinction upon a family, the distinction may be
something to blush for.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Shareholder’s Troubles.
A decision recently arrived at by Judge
Hamilton, in Melbourne, opens a gratifying
prospect for Australian shareholders. Some
four or live years ago a man named Bald owned
some shares in the City and County Bank, and
in October, 1888, he sold them in the accustomed
way through a broker. The purchaser was the
manager of the bank, and he bought —so he
declares—on account of the bank, which was
then engaged in creating an artificial demand
for its own shares in order that it might rush off
a new issue at a premium. There is no reason
to believe that Bald knew who bought the
shares, and in such cases the seller very seldom
does know ; he doesn’t even see the signature
at the foot of the buyer’s cheque, for
the broker puts that document to his
own credit, and gives his own cheque to the
seller. Bald simply got rid of his shares, and
thought no more about them. But when the
City and County Bank burst, it was discovered
that the transfer had never been registered —■
which was entirely the purchaser’s fault, for
the seller has no well-defined powers to compel
the other man to register. Then the liquidator
dropped upon the miserable Bald for calls to
help pay the liabilities of the defunct institu-
tion, and Judge Hamilton decided that he
must pay, because the purchase by the Bank was
an illegal transaction, and was therefore null
and void, or something to that effect. Conse-
quently, Bald is fined in an indefinite amount,
under the name of calls, because another person
committed an illegal action, and the man who
did the illegal action isn’t fined at all. Of
course, as the sale was illegal, the person who
collected the dividends after 1888 collected them
illegally, but Bald doesn’t recover this item —■
lie cast his scrip upon the waters, and the loss
came back after many days, but the profits are
never heard of any more. Under this system
it is a precarious job to be a shareholder in Aus-
tralia. No man who has ever sold shares can
tell for certain whether he sold them legally or
not ; all he can do is to ask the broker, and the
chance of the broker telling him the truth is
exceedingly limited, for the fraternity arc among
the hardest’ liars of the community and have
been so from the days of Ananias down-
wards. And, as the natural result, any
man who ever owned an interest in a
wild-cat mine or a few shares in a bank is
liable to be visited by the ghost of his old
speculation in after years, or if he dies before
it comes, it may arrive in time to ruin his
widow or his children. The ex-shareholder, in
fact, is a Frankenstein Avhose monster is
always waiting for a chance to come back and
step on him in his old age, and flatten him out.
When once a man has owned shares in anything
his only security, apparently, is to fly to the
uttermost ends of the earth, and lie low there
till his company bursts, and the liquidation is
over, and the liquidator is dead, and everything
is wound up and forgotten.
Tkk “National” Association of New South
Wales decided at its last meeting to call together
“representatives of the cricket, rowing, foot-
ball and other clubs, and the various organisa-
tions of young men in Sydney, with a view to
inducing their members to take a greater
interest in public matters and become members
of the Association.” This means that in each
club some member will be put up to move
“ that this club gives a solid and unanimous
support to the Association,” and as all that
section of the calf-and-breast-bone brigade,
which approves of the movement will be pre-
sent, and a lot of the others will be absent, the
resolution stands a reasonable show, in many
instances, of being passed. Then, if the thing
can be fixed properly, it will become one of
the recognised qualifications of an athlete that
he must be a bigoted Tory, and the block vote
of the man who kicks the inflated football, and
the man who hangs out on the weather gun-
wale when a gale is blowing, and the “ harrier”
Avho goes out on Saturday afternoons and gallops
through Chinamen’s gardens, will, in a great
measure, run the country. The idea, in short,
is to arrange a device by which, when an elec-
tion comes on, the “ National ” Association will
select the candidates, and send out its ukase to
the cricketer and footballer and the boating-
man “ mid nodings on,” and the harrier,
and the affiliated pony - racing man, and
the Y.M.C.A., and the society that collects
old postage stamps, and the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Charity
Organisation Society, and the Liedertafel,
and the Cremation Society, and the chess-club,
and the dog-show, and command their unani-
mous support with no questions asked. It is a
great device, but then it will only end in the
democratic athletes starting a separate business
on their own account, and if one fellow hangs
out on the jibboom in the cause of proputty,
another fellow will hang out on another jibboom
in the interests of manhood suffrage, and when
one man does a high jump for the cause of
Toryism, another will jump pretty nearly as
high on the other side. The “ National ” Ass.,
as he grows older, becomes more of an ass than
ever.
Editor Bulletin, —Sir, —A series of blunders
has led Australia into her present position with
regard to the British money-lender. A country
which can grow all her own beef and bread,
raise all the “ claret, champagne, and sardines ”
that she requires, and produce even her own
quinine and castor - oil, ought never to be
“beholden” to foreign aid or soil for food,
clothing, medicine, or luxuries, every one of
which, even to the very gold and silver required
for current coin, can be yielded from her own
soil and w'aters. Yet, what do we see? There
is a place called Dundee, in Scotland, whence
they have to send 3000 miles for lemons, and
5000 miles for sugar, and yet these people make
marmalade, and send it 12,000 miles to Austra-
lian consumers, who, it they like, can grow the
lemons and the sugar in their ow'n back
gardens ! Ex pede Herculetn. Here is a clue
to the whole business. Australia, Avho, if she
were only true to herself, could be a lender in
place of a borrower of money, gets loans from
Great Britain, not all in money, but partly in
steel rails and the like, on which she has to pay
interest for ever. It just reminds one of the
other class of money-lender, who advances to
the spendthrift £IOO, of which £ls are in
sovereigns and the balance of £BS in “ wine ”
and “pictures.” It is much of a piece and is a
disastrous job for the borrower in both cases ;
for the steel rails go to make railways to the
Never Never, lines Avhich don’t pay for the
axle-grease, and were only undertaken to retain
the political votes of insolvent paid-members of
Parliament. What a use for a ucav and glori-
ous country, its funds and its credit! Were
Australia of my temper, she would, at all
sacrifice, in the way of land sales, Treasury
bills and other “ tide-over” measures, in future
let England’s money congest for ever in her
coffers, or be lent to those “ wild cat ” South
American repAiblics which the venal, black-
mailing London “financial” press so delights
to honour.—Yours, etc., N. Bartley, Brisbane.
The election of Labour-candidate Hall as
M.L.A. for Bundaberg (Q.), is comparatively
a lucky fluke, but yet a thorough disproof of
the recent cockcroAving assertions of the Tory
papers that the working men in the Burnett
district are in favour of Kanaka labour. Bun-
daberg is the capital of the Musgrave elector-
ate which recently re-elected W. B. O’Connell.
And Bundaberg lias reversed Musgrave’s fat.
Hall, who polled 450, was opposed by Kanako-
phile Duffy (352), Curtis (169), and Skyrtng
(14). Duffy is one of that new sort of Tory
uncommonly too frequent in Australia. Time
was, within the writer’s recollection, when
Michael Duffy rowed by night and day the
ferry-boat at Gillon’s Crossing— ls bob a Aveek
and tucker, and camp in the boat-shed. He
loudly professed Home Rule and labour views,
and w T as of frugal mind, but also acquisi-
tive. His hunger was for land, and he
became one of Bundaberg’s wealthiest citizens,
was several times Mayor, and wrote a much-
advertised testimonial as to the efficacy of (say)
“ Horner’s Unsafe Killall.” When Avealthy,
the ex-land-hankerer attached himself to the
MTlwraith party, Mac, in the meantime,
having taken Gin-Gin station in that district.
Duffy was the mightiest political possibility
for Bundaberg of this election. He blames
Curtis, a storekeeper of much local renown,
for splitting up his chances. Had Duffy polled
all Curtis’s votes (and he Avould not), he Avould
then only have scored 71 ahead of the despised
Labour and Anti-Kanaka man. Skyring’s 14
need not be counted, and yet Skyring is one of
the pioneers of Bundaberg, and was an in-
fluential and Avell-to-do butcher in the days
Avhen boatman Mike slept in his shirt, pants
and bare feet on the form of Gillon’s ferry-
boathouse. Politics is queer business.
At the meeting of the Ncav South Wales bogus
“ National ” Association last week—
A lengthy debate ensued as t o the best means by which
the present depression might lie checked, and a similar
State of things avoided in the future. The general con-
sensus of opinion was that the difficulty had arisen from
the too great congestion of population in the cities, which
could only be relieved by the proper settlement of the
people upon the land. Various suggestions for bringh g
about an improved state of affairs were put forward, but
as there appeared to be a great diversity of opinion upon
the matter it was proposed by the president that c< m-
peiitixe essavs be invited, and that a prize lie offered tor
the best composition setting forth a means of placing a
greater proportion of the population upon the soil, with
the. least passible injury to exinlin;/ ritjhU. This pro-
posal was unanimously agreed to, and a member of the
council present offered a prize of £25, to be given to the
successful essayist.
The Bulletin hereby furnishes the outlines of
a scheme that would annex that £25 and give
the utmost satisfaction to the “ National ” Ass.
Let every squatter in New South Wales ha
granted the freehold of liis run on condition
that he leases out half the property in 200-
acre farms for the benefit of the unemployed.
The squatter to decide which half shall he
leased. In order to give an aspect of
benevolence to the scheme let each tenant
have his ground free for five years on con-
dition that he effects improvements to the
extent of (say) £3 an acre. After the five years
is up let the landlord, the squatter, fix the rent
as he thinks best, and if it isn’t paid, let him
grab the improvements. In order to facilitate
settlement, let railways and irrigation-works
be constructed, and paid for by a special tax
upon the tenant. This item is not, however, to
be a mortgage upon the improvements. Also,
let all the unemployed who are not thus pro-
vided for be arrested and set to making roads
and tanks on the squatters’ own half of the
property, and let all shearing be done by
Kanaka labour, so as to obviate strikes, which
are disastrous and lead to vexation. Any
person suspected of firing grass to be hanged.
Each squatter to be appointed a magistrate,
with the powers of a District Court Judge, in
his own district, and be allowed to swear-in
special constables and to flog by summary juris-
diction. Every tenant who is evicted and loses
his improvements through non-payment of rent
to be moved on westward, and planted on a
farm on some other run, and set to wprk to
make more improvements. If this scheme
wouldn’t “settle the people on the land,” what
kind of a scheme would ?
Minister Wheeler is running a lot of out-
of-date, liattered carriages, the handles and wind-
ows of which won't woik, on the Melbourne
suburban lines.
One of two N.S.W. prisoners, whose
sentences were very largely increased years ago
for forging bank-notes in gaol, recently died at a
ripe old age. A/>ro/:ox, in the easy-going days of
Prison-Comptroller Harold Maclean, a civilian
and a prisoner were caught red-hat ded “coining
sovereigns” in the same gaol. It was a very clear
case, yet the ends of Justice were amply satisfied

the sentence of the prisoner, who, it transpired
aftei wards, “ blew the gaff ’ because his male Mas

The Parson He Says “No.”
Bishop Webber: “ I fail to see it is a bad thing to bring
the islanders face to face with the more trying conditions
of our unaccustomed (sic) civilization.” Contrast the
utterances of the Anglican shepherd with (he manly and
stirring appeal issued to White Queensland by Rev. J.
Moore, of Bundaberg !
We thought to raise a nation hero of men who
dared be free;
We thought to have one people here, right through
from sea to sea ;
We thought to clear the slavery taint from Queens-
land, high and low,
We thought our aim a noble one —but Parson, he
says, “ No !”
We thought it wrong to steal away the black man
from his isle ;
We thought the slave-trade dirty, and we thought
the slaver vile;
We thought the words of waning—“Ye shall
reap just as ye sow ” —
Would bring us home a harvest black —but Parson,
he says, “No !”
We thought the taint of blood accursed that rested
on the trade ;
We knew the “Jason’s ” story well—the trip the
“ Hopeful ” made;
We nourished hopes wc soon should say, “It
happened long ago—
Thank Hod, ’tis o’er—the dirty game’’-but
Parson, he says, “No !”
We thought that all men hated the hideous social
sore—
Bred by the rotten traffic—that festers at our
door;
The thousand graves of sable slaves cried, “Let
our brethren go !”
But a traitor band have sold the land and say, like
Parson, “No !”
We thought of Wilberforce and Sharpe, we
thought of Manning, too ;
We thought our cause must win applause f;om all
the good and true ;
We thought the Church might lend her hand to
raise the child of woe,
As oft she did in days of yore—but Parson, lie
says, “No!”
We hoped—in vain our hoping. We see the
hireling stand
And preach the cause of cruel wrong as Gospel in
the land :
Ye followers of the gentle Christ—come, tell us,
is it so ?
this the creed of the Nazarene? Hie People
thunder—“ No !”

From Charley, of Melbourne, to his friend
William, of Woolloomooloo.
Dear Bill, ’ere goes a letter (which I 'ope 'll find
yer “ fit ”)
On a matter which ’as shook my bloomin’ liver up
a bit.
Have yer ’card about our Railways and the way
as ’ow the State
Has been blowin’ cold and hot upon that ever-
lastin’ Speight ?
Old Speight he was the fashun when he bossed
the show at fust —
He was biz’nesslike and clever, and a covey they
could trust.
They said lie managed traffick like a n’angel from
on ’igh,
And yer never would ’ave thought they’d go and
chuck ’im, by-and-byo.
But they kep’ on votin’ millions for the System to
expand,
Till every country member ’ad a station near his
land,
And when they’d done the dammige they was
stricken with dismay
At the orfulness of Speight in makin’ lines that
couldn’t pay.
Then Gillies took the knock and pious Jimmy ’ad
the stage,
And presently conic Sliicls upon the shoulders of
the Age;
And Speight he sunk in splendur, like the slowly
settin’ sun,
While the Govingment was sweariu’ that he
oughter ’ave the rim.
He might ’ave got ’is notice and been shunted from
’is place,
Same as any other servant in a similar kind of case,
But the Govingment, still sayin’ they intended to
be “firm,”
Gives Speight a noo engagem nt for another
blessed term.
The Railways kep’ on losin’ wnss than ever all the
while,
Old Speight was told to stop it, but he anserd
with a smile,
For the place was going broker and lie couldn’t
see ’is way
To increase the population on them lines that
didn’t pay.
All “ at once ” he got suspended, as election time
drew near,
They said he was an evil as was doomed to dis-
appear :
Incompetent they called ’im, and the country cried
“ Hooroo!
If he doesn’t know his bizness we must ’ave a man
as do.”
Then Wheeler undertook to show ’ow Speight ’ad
made a mess,
He raised the fares, and snorted when he found
the traffik less;
He prayed the Lord to ’elp ’im, so I’ve ’card a
feller say,
But the more he worked the Railways, why the
more they didn't pay.
And Speight, who was so bad they couldn’t stand
’im any more,
Will take six thousand quid (becos the country’s
very poor)
In return for his consentin’ not to offer a
“defence” —
Which explains the situashun to a chap with any
sense.
Dear Bill, if yer imployer thort yer wasn’t worth
yer sorlt,
If yer didn’t pay attenshun when he told yer of a
forlt,
If he swore as ’ow you only poured his money
down the sink,
Would he give yer compensashun when lie sacked
yer, do yer think ?
There’s more than meets the hoplic in this little
game with Speight,
And it don’t refleck much credit on the morals of
the State :
For a Govingment whose motto is Retrenchment
and Reform
I should call this conduct cool, Bill, if it wasn't
pretty warm.


[?]
816 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, June 15,1892.
My Dear Mooraiunua,—
Two women only, Mrs. 8.8. and Isabel “ Urkert,”
bring careful dressing to bear on “Fedora” at Sydney
Royal, but you can t help wondering whether, in real
life, a woman so mentally worried as Fedora was would
have found time to curl even the short hairs on the naue
of her neck ? Mrs. Beere’s Fedora frocks are the liveliest
she has yet sported. The first has a silver-coloured tail
of velvet coming from the shoulder, the undress of white
satin with dot circles in steel, steel fringing on the cor-
sage, white feather boa, and white plume fan. In act 2,
Miss Urquhart displayed her fine figure in a black silk
bodice and voluminous train with bunches of blue ostrich
on one side ; skirt of pale-blue erSpon with clusters here
and there of black feathers ; big black flirting fan. Mrs.
Beere chose a salad-coloured Empire dress, and the
style didn’t suit her back view. When a lofty lady wears
her waist under her arm-pits she reminds me somehow of
the pantomime giantess who is one man perched on
another’s shoulders. But the gown was very smart —a
green silk, gold ’broidery, yellow satin, and
diamonds.
Mrs. Beere, however, looked her very best in a pale-blue
crepon tea-gown, eccentrically diversified with fine white
lace and scarves of new pink—girdle of pink with golden
ends, worn in the third act, where Otho Stuart (who is
the same clean-shaved, white-cuffed lover whatever he
plays—why doesn’t he take a hint from Mens. Marius,
who has to speak before he is recognised in each bill) is
such a long time accepting an invitation that any other
man would jump at. In the last agony'-scene, Isabel
Urkert, in a wondrous mushroom-coloured frock of
phenomenal fit, and trimmed with brown velvet and
wheat sheaves (in sepia tints) upside down about her
person, gabbled so that she might have been unburdening
her stage-soul in Choctaw—but it didn’t matter much.
\\ hen a fine woman has a well-gored skirt on, the spec-
tacle is more optical than auriculaw. Mrs. Beere pizened
herself in flowing white robes, like the things the Heavenly
choir-girls are said to wear—perhaps Fedora tried it on to
see if angelic millinery beetle her style of beauty before
she let Gallagher go.
The circle was rather erratic in its behaviour at the
diagnosed extensively above. One lady, seated
in deep gloom, stood up and vb.’ently waved her fan at
the actress after each curtain, as if she were a mosquito
ora fly, or something that had to be blown away, but i 5
was only another way of cheering, I suppose. And after
you got used to the upward jerks of this excited patroness
of the drama, in came a nerveful young man with a cup
of very hot coffee for a lady in the front row. It was the
first cup of anything hot 1 have ever seen in the circle.
As a rule the thirsty d.e. seraph dips her flushed visage
into a long, cold, soda-soaked squash, or else a flabby
“ lemonade with ” gets into her nose and makes her eyes
water, so you can imagine how cheerful that pioneer cup
of coffee looked ! If they could manage to have ice-cream
in the summer and coffee in the winter, at the theatres, it
would be—well, for one thing it would be only the most
flnancially-solid young man who could manage to take his
lady friends to the play I suppose.
And, talking about refreshment In dress-circles, I was
rather horrified at the Criterion, the other night, when a
lady in front of me produced an immense sweet from her
handkerchief, sucked it affectionately for five minutes by
the Waterbury, and put it back into her handker-
chief. The staying powers qf that bull’s-eye, or whatever
it was, must have been immense, for she repeated the per-
formance after every act! But let’s be charitable; perhaps
she was cutting her wisdom teeth on it.
The circle was large on the fourth night. Rather a
theatrical design was sported by a young lady—the low-
cut bodice was outlined into a large heart frontally, by
golden fringe. If daws peck at a heart on your sleeve
what’s going to happen when it covers the whole of your
diaphragm? Another lady was stout, and very V-shaped,
of course, but what riveted my astonished eye was when
she guided the handle of her fan half-way down her spine
and agitated it d la scratchback with a bland expression
tike that of a cat basking in the sun in a dairy.
The mid-winter meeting of the A.J.C. was galloped off
at Randwick last Saturday, amid bookmakers’ shrieks
that could be heard half-way across the Centennial Paris.
Belledorn wasn’t largely represented on the stand—none
of the coaches had any women on top, and the throng of
mere men adorning the roofs and the run home gave the
dashing vehicles a misty resemblance to a returning
auction-sale. Nevertheless, two or three satisfactory frocks
were visible.
Mrs. W. Mitchell 1 promenaded in a rough black woollen,
contrasted with sapphire-blue silk, covered on the bodice
with black guipure, bonnet en suite, with flesh-pink
wings;, Mrs. G.eo. Brock wore an uncommon get-up of
pale and dark-blue striped floral brocade, trimmed with
dark-blue ostrich feathers, hat en suite. Miss Carrie
Swain’s well-fitting dress was of navy-blue cloth, Eton
jacket, edged with gimp, over a full blouse vest of del-
blue surah, equestrienne hat of blue velvet, trimmed with
pale-blue ribbon and quills ; a sassiety lady in grey, with
half her sleeves tan from the elbow down, reminded me of
a coffee-coloured sister with her sleeves turned up ; Isabel
Urquhart was startling in white silk, trimmed with black
jet, small horned bonnet en suite ; one of Sydney’s infre-
quent lady doctors wore her scientific little fists poked
mannishly into the deep pockets of a rather unbecoming
sac coat, and another charming girl wanned her digital
extremities in what was probably not the only muff on
the lawn.
Two good concerts eventuated in Sydney last week.
The first (in the Y.M.C.A.) was given by French musicians
iij aid of distressed compatriots, and was a great success
iii every way. Among the instrumentalists Madame Keller..
mann, in cream brocade, played her sparkling valse de
concert with much effect and was overwhelmed with
flowers; Kowalski’s rendering of his own thundering
“Cuirassiers” was a dashing effort, but he began so
boisterously in “The Fairies’ Dance” that it almost
seemed as if the fairies were hopping in clogs. Wiegand,
Dr. Laure, and his son (who is an amateur fiddler), Miss
Young, Mdme. Acngenheyster, Poussard, ai d Mons.
Deslouis filled the bill. The last-named artist was in
splendid voice for his three numbers, especially in the
“ Ballade ” from “ L’Africaine ” and the ever-green “ Les
Hameaux,” with piano, fiddle, and organ support, which
was greatly applauded. By the way, why will Sydney
audiences begin to clap before the singer is finished ? It is
the very worst taste to applaud while the accompanist i 8
playing the concluding bars, for although the song is the
thing there really ought to be a little courtesy shown to
the man at the wheel, so to speak. Snazelle was the only
artist I ever saw equal to the occasion. No matter if the
“front” howled at him at a concert he never moved a
muscle in acknowledgment until the music stopped.
Herr Josef Kretschmann’s pupils’ concert went off
beautifully in the Centennial Hall last Saturday, and
there was a huge audience. The bill was awesomely
classical - Liszt, Spohr, Mendelssohn, etc. —and Signora
Dink, “Charlie” Huenerbein and the Orpheus folks
assisted the pupils (who didn’t seem to exactly cry out
for assistance, by the way) in their little set to with music,
Heavenly maid. Unlike most pupils’ concerts where the
items cover four sides of the programme and you wish
you were dead or next the door, the performers were only
seven in number. Herr Kretschmann is to be congratu-
lated on his good sense in only turning his best pupils
loose on a long-suffering public.
Talking of music reminds me that somebody who is to
astonish Australia directly with the results of her musical
studies in Europe, returned quietly and under an assumed
name to her native city a little while ago. Her old
teacher—warm-hearted, unselfish old man ! who had first
discovered and encouraged her musical talents and given
her lessons “for love,” as they say—was still where she
had left him, but she did not look him up—only casually
happened across him in the street one day. He was filled
with simple delight at the sight of his clever pupil, and
warmly invited her to come and see him—but my lady
drew herself up stiffly: “ Herr Blank,” she said patronis-
ingly, “I am at home every Tuesday!” Now, the
question is how much warm, spontaneous soul will the
lady put into her performances ?
Sydney Women’s Literary Club members have at last
achieved an ark of their ow r n, instead of perching here
and there in barren and undraped rooms lent by Messrs.
So-and-So—and now we shall see whether the fact of
meeting a la Israelite is the reason for the absence of the
milk in the cocoanut. When the art member has splashed
gold paint in impressionist blobs on the door-panels, and
the musical member has a piano in the corner and a fiddle
on top of it, and the aesthetic member has draped every,
thing with giraffe’s-sneeze silk, and the reciting member
hds hired two fat men to try the platform, and the greedy
member has arranged for five o’clock tea to emerge piping
hot from some unsuspected direction, and the lazy mem-
ber has seen to the chairs—then will the hour be, and let
us hope the woman. But, at present, the ink isn’t dry
on their first rent-receipt.
Brisbane, by the way, has a Literary Club. It is ad-
dicted to water-picnics, where the members read one
another’s little efforts aloud, and the rest —except the
genius whose thunder is in the air—murmur ecstatic
nothings at the finish. But what fearful opportunities
for retaliation the system offers to the jealous poetess to
spoil the effect of a rival’s “ little thing !” A judiciously-
timed hiccough on the reader’s part would ruin the effect
of an epic. In Sydney and Melbourne every girl clutches
her own MS., you bet.
Sydney Women’s College Fund continues to be a drag
on its unhappy backers, who are now too jaded to travel
round with the bag—or so one judges from the fact that
£lO9 Is. 6d. was all the treasurer had in hand “for
general purposes” at the recent committee meeting. The
Women’s College was established by sheer (ladylike)
obstinacy and determination, and no doubt its energetic
foundresses thought that when the educational ark was
a-moverin’ they might relax a little—sit in the shade and
admire their fell work, as it were, but alas 1 none of the
enthusiasts who started it have really got out of collar
since. There are more shows got up for this white
elephant of book-larnin’ than were ever needed to keep
any institution in Sydney on its feet before.
What becomes of the beautiful wire-stalked blossoms
that are showered on friends leaving for England per
mail-steamer? I have often seen a something in the
veiled eye of the priestess of mal-de-mer which seemed to
say that she wasn’t goin’ to have no muddle in her cabins,
and the other day my suspicions, were confirmed. Some-
body wrote from Adelaide : “ I was very sick the first day
and the stewardess threw all my lovely flowers into the
sea.”
Talking of life on the brackish, a ship’s doctor (mind
you, he had a Byronic eye and stood six feet in any of his
numerous crewelled slippers, so, perhaps, he had an
unusually warm time of it) told me that the women on
board a mail-steamer, when they can't think of
any other complaint to gnaw at their vitals always
fall back on hysterics. They are nearly always
mock hysterics, and the patient doesn’t drum, her
heels on the floor very much if her feet are Australian
size; nor does she give out the hysterical laugh if her
back-teeth are gold-stopped, and so on, right through the
ladies’ cabins. So a new complaint has arisen called
“ Ship’s hysterics,” which is when the poor dear looks
slyly out of the corner of her eye to see what effect her
sufferings are having upon the doctor.
Which reminds me that there is rather a dearth of
gold buttons in Sydney lately, and though the dear
girls may regret the scarcity of Captain Corcoran et
cie, it’s scarcely likely their brothers will. Because men
do say that the gallant tars will junket to any extent, but
leave the settling-up to civilians. As everybody knows,
when a little party is made up to go picnicking in a hired
drag it’s the rule for the men of the party to go shares in
the thing and make it lighter for all pockets ; but the
marine individual follows the ladies in this as in every
other individual instance and ignores waiters, grooms,
toll-bars, and “ the piper” with lady-like indifference to
everything except the lovely view. Therefore, he isn’t
half so popular with Qussie as he is with Angelina. You
see, he doesn’t waltz with Gussie.
1 am requested to announce the engagement of Miss
Jessie Stevenson, of Meridale, South Yarra (Vic.), to Mr.
Geo. Turnball, manager of the National Bank, Sydney.
After which it seems apropos to say that 1 would have
enjoyed “Engaged” at the Criterion a great deal more
than I did if the adventures of Mr. Cheviot Hill, who
adores every woman he meets, hadn’t reminded me of
Deeming’s little fads. As Cheviot made furious love to
three seraphs you couldn’t help picturing him planting
some of them under the hearthstone. The dressing wasn’t
exceptionally lovely in Gilbert’s comedy, and my eagle
eye delected resurrections everywhere. For instance,
Pattie B.’s bridal dress of white brocade was the identical
staggerer that Miss Temple wore when she was married in
“ School ” ; and Miss Browne’s bit of blue muslin in the
last act rose up like an old, old friend.
On dit that Lady Jersey has made all necessary
arrangements tor a trip to Samoa, hut when or how isn’t
revealed—let’s hope anyway that she will wait until th
winter season of alleged gaieties stop. What globe-
trotters the Jerseys are !
In a rag-shop the other day I overheard a question and
answer between what was revealed to be a brand-new
bride and a female friend, which exhibited those very
general ceremonies—hasty marriages—in such a bony
light that the impatientßenedict of future connubialisings
may possibly be in less of a hurry to annex his Beatrice—
when 1 have told him all about it. Said tin friend to the
bride —who was seated at the counter with all sorts of
necessaries strewn round her—“ What! shopping already ?”
to which the bride made answer with a smile I fancied
rather deep: “ My dear, you must remember I had only
just a fortnight to get ready in ! ” and her reply set me
thinking of the manifestly economical aspect a spot
wedding has for the blushing bride. Can Petruchio
blame his Katharine (whom he has raced up to the altar)
if he finds that his angel was too rushed to lay in a dozen
pairs of silken hose and goodness knows what in lingerie?
Can he reasonably complain (when he remembers how he
broke the record round to the parson) if, instead of his
Poppet coming to cheer his hearthstone with a wardrohe-
full of wearing apparel paid for by Paw, he has to lit her
out cap a pic and foot it all out after the honeymoon ? if
the young man about to marry takes my advice he will
give his Pansy Blossom as much breathing lime as she
pretends to want, for it can’t be encouraging to commence
your double life with a darling who cries out for clothing
from the matrimonial jump.
There was a race-meeting for amateur riders at Rand-
vviek the other Wednesday, and the expected happened
as usual—half the silk-clad horsemen fell off. Neither
riders nor mounts were exceedingly beautiful viewed in
the lurid light that beats about a race-horse, and one
enthusiast took to the track on a subdued and melancholy
sort of combination of hoofs and hair whose daily avoca-
tion is to drag his tormentor all over the place in a buggy.
1 don’t like race-meetings for amateurs. When the starter
drops his flag and the inexperienced riders scuffle off in a
bunch, it hurts one’s sympathetic soul to see some
woman s face go while as chalk as this or that horse
makes a mistake at the first hurdle.
Madame Melba seems to be giving Australian women
big ad. in the “cities of an effete civilisation,” for I read
that at the Nice carnival her carriage, with a white swan
on either side of the coachman’s seat, was among the
prettiest there, and created a great sensation. She is also
reported to have worn “a very distingud toilet ” of grey
and gold—so if people think Australia is femininely popu-
lated with black gins in shark’s-teeth necklaces after that
the intelligence of Yewrope is past praying for.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

At last the Sydney licensing bench un-
compromisingly begins to knock out the dirty
rum-mill which, though licensed as “ hotel,” never
supplies a meal, and does not contain a decent
bed, but fattens all the time on the diseased
appetite of the blue-nosed soaker. Seventy per
cent of the so called Sydney “hotels” never would
be missed.
A Scotch clergyman announces, as the
result of many years’ observation, that ;?0,000
men and women go to bed drunk, in Glasgow,
every Saturday night. The calculation looks
eminently probable—in fact, anybody who has put
in a Saturday night in Gorbals, or Bridgeton, or
any other locality when the working-men most do
congregate, would probably reckon it an under-
estimate. The top storey of a tenement house is
the best place to gather information upon the sub-
ject, and the best time to begin is about ten p.m.,
when the drunk comes marching home and starts
to raise Cain. There are probably a dozen house-
holders living in the one tenement —sometimes
the houses contain only one room apiece, and in
that case there may be twenty or more— and out
of the twelve, seven are probably drunk. Some of
them leave their work at two, and are hopelessly
tight by four, and get home and break all the
dishes and whale the wife and the family by five,
and then sleep till seven, and go out again and
are beastly drunk a second time before nine ; but
the majority get “slewed” slowly, and arrive
home just about ten. Then they begin to arouse
Gehenna on the stairs. There is generally one
man who always collapses on the bottom step,
and after singing one or two verses of “Scots wha
hae, &c, , ” he falls asleep and the other people
step on him. Then there is the other man who
never can remember whether he lives up two
stairs or three, and he kicks furiously at
the wrong door, and the owner of the place
either rushes out and fights him on the landing,
or else embraces him and they both sing
“Auld Lang Syne.” Also there is the
man whose wife always gets drunk on credit on
Saturday afternoon, and liquidates the bill on
Monday, and she usually locks her husband out,
and they vituperate through the keyhole while the
old man is picking the lock. As for the other
drunks they are various, including the man who
sees a snake on the staircase, and the two indi-
viduals who wake up at midnight and yell till
two a.m. Most of the women get their clothes
out of pawn on Saturday evening, provided the
head of the family arrives home in time, and put
them in pawn again on Monday morning ; and
the fat woman with the clever children goes
down in the evening and pays five shillings off
the bill at the grocery shop which is lighted up by
two candles that gutter down on the cheese. Also
the woman whose husband has drunk all his
wages before he got home pervades the building
trying to borrow some coals, and her daughter
with the naked feet rushes round the adjacent
shops trying to get some oatmeal on credit. Last
of all, in the sma’ oors of the morning, the tene-
ment is wakened up by two policemen trying to
find the man who struck Buckley at the public-
house round the corner, and after they are gone
there is a great calm till Sunday morning, when
all the householders wake up and wash themselves
at the sink, and look wretchedly out of the win-
dow, or else lie in bed and smoke or chew tobacco.
The present writer sat op the corpse of one man
who used to chew tobacco almost all night, and
expectorate backwards over his head, but he wasn't
Scotch. He died suddenly at last, partly through
the visitation of Providence and partly through
the tobacco juice getting into'his eye.

Ab Sydney Royal, in the middle of last
week, Mrs, Bernard-Beere appeared with a strong
support in Sardou’s drawing-room melo-drama of
“Fedora,” English version, and played it with
varying success up to Wednesday last, when
it was withdrawn in favour of “ London
Assurance,” with the star in the part of Lady
Gay Spanker. There is little need to recapitulate
the plot of the piece written by Sardou to accom-
modate the histrionic needs of Sara Bernhardt. It
is simply the story of a woman who in her lust
for vengeance sacrifices all that is near and
dear to the victim whom she has learned
to love, and who, in the last act, in
a passionate frenzy of devotion and remorse
takes poison and dies —forgiven. Mrs. Bernard
Beere as the Countess Fedora Romanzoff achieved
a genuinely artistic success. Her emotional acting
was fine indeed, and her costumes were the despair
and admiration of a glittering d.c. The Jean de
Sirieux of M. Marius was a notable piece of work,
and rehabilitates that capable actor in the esteem
of his Sydney admirers. The Countess Olga
Soukereff of Miss Isabella Urquhart was a bright,
well-dressed, and altogether vivacious, impersona-
tion, which was highly appreciated by a discrimi-
nating but none too-well-filled house. Greteh,
the Russian police-agent of Mr. Kemp, was
lacking in spirit, and his make-up was that
of a shop-walker in a drapery emporium. Miss
Henrietta Watson was a very good Dmitri, and
several other actors and actresses played several
minor parts in a satisfactory manner. The Count
Loris Ipanoff of Mr. Otho Stuart was, however,
reminiscent of a Scotch clergyman of the English
Established Church doing duty in an aristocratic
London suburb, rather than of a Russian noble-
man of alleged Nihilistic antecedents. Neverthe-
less, his acting was very earnest, and well up to
the calibre of Mr. George Gordon’s scenery.

At Sydney Criterion—which, by the way,
has entered on the last week of its lease by Messrs.
Brough and Boueicault—W. S. Gilbert’s three-act
farcical comedy, “Engaged,” has been running
since the Bth inst. to fairly good houses. This
piece, like most of Gilbert’s sallies into the realm
of stage-craft, belongs to the puissant empire of
topsyturvydom. It is mainly concerned with the
adventures of a young man who loves every
woman he meets, and makes a point of proposing
marriage to every pretty girl from the princess in
the palace to the maid iu the kitchen, or the girl
behind the bar, against whom he chances to
stumble. As a foil to his vagaries there are two
male characters, one, Belvawney, who receives a
thousand a year for preventing his double-
blessedness ; and another, Symperson, who is
to receive an income of a thousand a
year from the day the Lothario above-
mentioned settles down in the hymeneal
hash-bin. There is also a canny Scot who makes
an honest living by throwing trains off the line,
and running a private still under the most
religious auspices. Most of the piece belongs to
Mr. Titheradge, who, under the play-bill name of
Cheviot Hill, wanders about the earth seeking for
the damsel in whom he recognises the tree upon
which the apple of his heart is growing, and lie
finds her mostly all the time, and in every con-
ceivable situation. Mr. Boucicault, in a roman-
tically artistic make-up, did good work in the part
of Belvawney, and the Symperson of Mr. Law-
rence was a creditable performance, albeit perhaps
a trifle elephantine. Mr. Percy Lyndal, as the
braw Scot, hadn’t a good grip of the gait of the
Scottish tongue, and made several fearful lapses
into drawing-room English. Miss Romer was
more than admirable as the Caledonian dame, and
Miss Brenda Gibson was as winsome a lowland
lassie as ever spoke the Hielau’ dialect. Miss
Temple, as the gushing and romantic Belinda,
and Miss Pattie Browne, as the practical and
level-headed Minnie, held up their two ends of an
impossible _ plot with great Mat and to the
riotous delight of an enraptured audience. To-
night (Thursday) the “ Pickpocket ” will be
staged, and to-morrow night- (Friday) the
Brough and Boucicault Comedy Company will
make their final bow to a Sydney audience at
the Criterion Theatre, in a revival of Wycherley’s
old English comedy of “ The Country Girl.”
** * *
At Sydney Her Majesty’s, “Little Jack
Sheppard,” otherwise Billee Barlow, clanked his
chains for the final time on Friday last, which was
made a glorious benefit night of for the especial
profit and delectation of the charming little lady
who has lately lent her name to the burlesques
and extravaganzas produced at this popular place
of amusement. On Saturday night the alleged
something-or-other yclept “Randolph the
Reckless ” was produced before a crowded house,
which manifested many signs of disapproval
and disappointment before the piece got finally
through. Of Miss Billee Barlow herself it is im-
possible to speak too highly. She sings capitally,
dances well, and acts with vim and spirit; but we
are sorry to see so much talent wasted on a plot-
less, dialogueless, lifeless and generally meaning-
less dramatic wreck such as the piece in question.
The heroine, Miss Edith Vane, indulges in too
much ballad, and Miss L. Davis indulges in too
much dance. Moreover, this last-named lady
o’ersteps somewhat the modesty of nature, and in
her skirt-dances indulges a little too freely in the
calisthenic exercises of the champion high-kicker.
The villain of the piece, Mr. Geo. Walton, is meri-
toriously funny. Mr. Shine maintains liis reputation
as well as his brilliant name, and Mr. Barnes
ought to be promptly and thoroughly suppressed.
One of the most encouraging spasms in “Ran-
dolph ” is the scene of the duel, a /a “Corsican
Brothers,” between Mr. Shine and Mr. Walton,
and the latter makes some good business out of a
hysterical champagne bottle. Miss Billee Barlow,
whom everybody will be grieved to lose, will be
succeeded, on Saturday next, by “La Cigale,” <s
presented by Williamson’s Opera Troupe.

At Sydney Garrick, Shakespeare has been
succeeded by Robertson, and David Garrick
staggers across the stage, but yester trod
by Hamlet’s tragic busk. Mr. Walter
Bentley fails, in our opinion, to retain
that consistency of character necessary to an
artistic presentation of London’s old-time actor.
His acting in the first part of the pjay ill-matched
with that of the drunken scene in the presence of


Australian Wines. —For universal good
quality, excellent value and moderate prices,
Innes and Co.’s Boar’s Head Brand of Australian
wines cannot be surpassed. They guarantee ail
their wines the pure juice of the grape, and then
prices, varying from Is. to da fid, per battle, bring
them within the reach of all Olasses. they can be
had from all wine merchants ,and grocers. Ho
sure you ask for the BOAR’S HLAH HRAN D,
and refuse all others, as this is the only genuine
brand.*

Ingot’s guests, although there were decided gleams
of very clever work. The Ada of Miss Laura
Hansen was a decided advance on her Ophelia,
although we hardly think she would have been the
woman to whom David Garrick would have offered
up his love. Mr. M'Gowan’s acting in the part of
Simon Ingot was a careful and adequate perform-
ance, and the Squire Chivy of Mr. H. R. Roberts
was a fairly spirited impersonation. Several
other people did their best in keeping the stage
from appearing empty, and Robertson’s comedy
was succeeded by “ Oramond Brig,” in which Mr.
Bentley gave an almost flawless character sketch
of Jock Howieson, and Mr. Atholwood made a
highly creditable King of Scotland. On Wednes-
day “ Richelieu” was produced with results pend-
ing next issue.

At Coogee Aquarium money is still taken
at the front door, and the Bondi resort of the
same description has added a fighting kangaroo to
the monsters of the deep. At the Garrick Theatre
on Sunday night the Albus, who have been
starring the provinces during the week, dispensed
sweet music at collection rates, and the Fiske
Jubilee Singers have taken possession of the Cen-
tenary Hall, at which gruesome tabernacle
double-A-flat vocalism is nightly retailed at cur-
rent prices, and a lady-tenor warbles and jodels in
a style calculated to bring the blessings of harmony
within the reach of the slenderest purse.

The dread of a taxations Budget and a
coming rise in the price of meat seems to settle
more and more on Melbourne’s chest. The loud,
large voice of the showman, calling upon an ex-
hausted public to book their seats six days in
advance, is treated with cynical indifference.
Times are so bad that a change of bill makes no
difference worth mentioning, because one enter-
tainment is the same as another to those who stop
away. “ Faust up to Date,” at Melbourne Opera
House, has traded not unsuccessfully upon the
belief that a Gaiety burlesque is good for depres-
sion, but even the subtle humour of a Devil in a
red stove-pipe hat is losing its charm, Lonnen
gives them “ Ballyhooly ” in response to the
“particular desire” of somebody (the manager,
perhaps), without dispelling the gloomy suspicion
that a comic song grows serious in its old age,
and custom begins to stale the frenzy of “ Boom-
de-ay.” For Saturday, another burlesque, the
second of the series, is promised. This will be
produced under the title of “Joan of Arc,” and
rumour states that the Bogey Man will be resur-
rected in the course of the evening.

Audiences great only in enthusiasm rolled
up to the two concerts and one performance of
“The Barber, ’at Melbourne Princess’s. “ Rigo-
letto,” on Saturday, was another genuine artistic
success which caused the vacant dress-circle seats
to look like indignant protests against the hollow-
ness of a so-called “ musical world.” Other parts
of the house were well attended, however, and the
shouts showered upon this fine performance
encouraged the hope that its repetition on Mon-
day and Tuesday would be duly appreciated. On
Wednesday, the Italians were to rest whilst an
English company, including Miss Colborne Baber,
Ida Osborne, Henry Stookwell, and Allan Morris
kept the ball rolling with “ Maritana.” To-night
(Thursday) the bill is “ Lucia,” to-morrow
“Maritana ” chips in again, and on Saturday the
Bride of Lammermoor may once more break the
heart of her mash in top boots.

Foli and Orlando Harley have been en-
gaged for the four remaining concerts, two each
week probably, and the Italian Opera season will
evidently be worked up to a gorgeous climax.

“ New Lamps for Old ” has not flourished
exceedingly at the Bijou. Some of its best jokes
pass almost unnoticed by the audience, and a good
many more jokes have escaped the eye of the com-
pany. Cecil Ward, in particular, takes no trouble
to play his part for all it is worth, whereas Cannam
errs in the opposite direction. Mr. and Mrs.
Brough and Cambourne show a decided improve-
ment since the opening night, and “New Lamps
for Old ” would have hummed in the humming
times of yore, anyway. On Saturday they put up
“ The Arabian Nights ” to fill in a week, after
which the amalgamated B. and B. forces will
attack “The Country Girl ” on a scale of unusual
splendour.

At Melbourne Royal the indomitable Bland
Holt continues to change his expensive spectacles
every Saturday without altering the fact that he
can t fetch a full house on the other five nights.
The supporters of British melodrama come for-
ward in their thousands and cheer the first pro-
duction of a show with deceptive gusto, and then
the supply of multitude is turned down low at the
meter. “ London Day by Day ” is a large, im-
posing thing of its class, exceedingly well played
in all directions, but it will retire on Saturday in
favour of sometlTing else, wherefore an honourable
mention of Charles Glenny, Baker, Walter Howe,
Albert Norman, Bland Holt, Miss Kate Bishop,
Edith Blande, Flora Anstead, and Harrie Ireland,
who shine brightest amidst a long string of per-
formers, will meet the requirements of the
case. Miss Harrie Ireland, seen in Mel-
bourne for the first time, made a good
impression when her nervousness wore off, and
is a very evident acquisition to the_ company.
The policeman who stalks on at the finish of these
splendid outrages and puts matters straight
doesn’t seem to satisfy the gallery any more, how-
ever. He has become an object of scorn by reason
of his constant readiness to arrest the villain with-
out a warrant, on the evidence of a casual gutter-
snipe and the unsupported testimony of a female
in distress. As an instrument of dramatic justice
the policeman is now quite obsolete, and his
appearance on the scene is the signal for the gods
to disperse with a loud noise which drowns the
voice of the hero as he explains that the clouds
have dispersed, or thanks heaven that somebody s
innocence is proved.

The Dam piers breathed their last at the
Alexandra on Saturday, and are about to open a
provincial tour at Ballarat. Meanwhile the place
where Lily has brought down so many curtains on
tableaux in which she and a revolver were leading
features is being cleaned up in readiness for Hany
Rickards.
Concerts at the Exhibition and at the
Rotunda underneath the Siege of Paris are fairly
attended, and the Cogills, who have Slade
Murray and young Jules Simonsen singing for
them, seem to be thriving at St. George’s Hall.
The circus advertises eight performances a week,
as usual, and comes out with startling announce-
ments at regular intervals. Also, Little Lilian,
the Waxworks shootist, knocks an apple off the
head of a dog with a certainty which reflects
great credit on Lilian, and speaks volumes for the
calm trustfulness of the dawg.

Some of the dramatic scribes are surprised
that Walter Bentley makes Hamlet’s madness a
pretence. He couldn’t well do otherwise, unless
he were as ignorant of the text as some of his
critics. “As I, perchance, hereafter shall think
meet to put an an tick disposition on. ”

The Rignold season, at Adelaide Royal,
closed on Saturday (June 11), and despite the fact
that both brothers have been on the spot and that
a gift distribution was a feature in one perform-
ance, the venture has not been a startling success.
“Faust” did moderately well, but “In the
Ranks” and “Nowadays” failed to fetch folk
along. Signor Foli is now in musical possession
at the Royal, while his rivals for public favour are
the Liliputian Opera singers at Garner’s, and
Tommy Hudson at the Town Hall. Sheridan and
his Widow are at Broken Hill.

Williamson’s Opera Company finished up
their last week at Brisbane Opera House with
“Marjorie,” “Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,” and a benefit
for Bracy on the last night. On Saturday morn-
ing at 8 a.m. they stole silently down the river
enveloped in a cold, grey mist. Rev. H. Rickards
commenced a mission at the Gaiety on Saturday
night and lifted up his voice in several hosannas
of the “ Knocked ’em in the Old Kent Road ”
variety. But the dark spectre of discontent looms
largely on the horizon, and the singing evangelist
aforementioned will scarcely fill the aching void
caused by the departure of Ryley and the giddy
chorus maiden. The Taylor-Carrington Co. is
bound North. The Royal re-opens on Saturday
(18th) with “The Vagabond,” for which a com-
pany engineered by one Hayman will be morally
responsible.

In the Melbourne Divorce-court, last
Monday, Miss Lily Dampier was “ put asunder”
from her' husband," Bill Watkin, costs to be paid
by the said Watkin if he can be found, which
seems an eminently improbable circumstance. It
s a short and simple story, the tale of Lily’s
married life. Mr. Watkin is an actor—we remem-
ber seeing him on the stage with a cocked-hat on
his head, the side of the cocked-hat being turned
to the front. He was playing, if we remember
rightly, with a nigger who afterwards got into
trouble or something, and with Alf. Boothman and
various others. There was a baleful look in
Boothman’s eye, as if he didn’t like Watkin—if
that ivas Watkin, for we are only speaking from
memory. Anyhow, Lily fell in love with him,
and they were secretly married in 1889.
For some unexplained reason they didn’t
tell the old man —we mean dear old
Alfred Dampier—till two years afterwards.
This proceeding doesn’t harmonise well with the
gentle, trustful look in Miss Dampier’s big, dark
eyes, but probably Watkin was responsible. Any-
how, in June last year that base deceiver fled
with another girl and hasn’t been seen since. We
don’t know the other girl, but we will bet she was
ugly; there is a demon of cussedness about the
bad man of the period, and when he leaves his
young and beautiful wife he generally elopes with
a painted harridan of forty. Miss Dampier looked
pretty and resigned in court, and wore a becoming
costume, and the divorce was granted on account
of “ misconduct ’’—with costs, as already men-
tioned, if anyone can find the defendant and
collect them.

Dear Bulletin,— Your remark re the Silbons’ recent
misfortunes, calls to mind the tact that I saw them in
Auckland, en route to Australia with Sells Bros., when a
friend of mine, a U.S.S. Co.’s purser who had travelled
with them previously, and did not know of their recent
trouble, delicately asked the reason of their mourning
<*arb. On being informed he expressed his sympathy,
when the married sister exclaimed : “ Yes, Mr. A., it was
a pity, it has quite spoilt the .principal act of our show."
This is bed-rock truth.— Jonah.
George Rignold took his Adelaide audience into his
confidence the other night. He said he was not a good
manager or he would have staged “ Henry V.” and
“ Romany Rye” instead of “My Partner” and “ In the
Ranks ” still he was glad that they liked him as the
Devil, but he was not as good as brother Bill. Cheers.
Rev. J. Reid, the new Melbourne Sunday lecturer, was
partly pulpit-exiled because of a really slashing sermon he
delivered at St. Augustine’s Congregational Church,
Hawthorn, a few months ago. Incautiously they let him
in the box on a Sunday night, and he forthwith pitched
into the rich warehousemen for keeping their clerks over-
time and giving them sixpence for a tea at De Freitas
the worthy eight o’clock rush man.
Rubinstein’s unactable opera, “ The Tower of Babel,”
is remarkable for the grandeur of its stage directions.
The final scene is laid in three horizontal compartments.
The top flat, says the inspired composer, must represent
Heaven and the Heavenly Host, the middle is reserved
for the Earth and the inhabitants thereof, and the bottom
floor is Hell, with Satan seated on his throne, surrounded
bv the infernal deities. Even Vincent Crummies would
have shrunk from producing this opera, on a. scale of
unusual magnificence for a short season. Initial difficulty:
Who would represent the Almighty ? George Rignold .
The Atiiena4UM says Miss Aohurch, to fulfil her promise
and succeed now in London, “ must forget all that she
has learned in Australia- screaming, grimaces exaggera-
tion hysteria—and return to her former girlish freshness
and pathos.” Alas! We like our acting like our drinks
—they must both “ bite all the way down.

The Fitzgeralds are getting up steam for the production
of a lurid equestrian drama on the subject of Ned Kelly
and Company. Lance Lenton has prepared a series of
wild incidents and striking situations founded upon
everything the Kellys ever did and a number of things
they never thought of doing. Dead policemen are
scattered liberally amidst the plot, and Miss Kate Kelly
figures as the virtuous heroine who offers up prayers for
the gang whilst they are rampaging round the circus in
quest of blood and treasure.

received for one recital over £5OO. About 100 years ago
Mozart gave a concert in Cornhill and netted £5.

There are no theatrical advertisements in the Paris

Lambescasse, a Thespian character drawn in a Paris
paper, is familiar in Australia. He is a super., and ex-
plains how he has been conspired out of dramatic star-
hood. “Sir! I had just one chance, a scene with
Lemaitre. I killed him dead! He turned ashy pale
under his make-up. After that I was a marked man.”
Then Lambescasse, made up as a black slave, goes on the
stage to be kicked by the star.
Two Melbourne theatres are on the sick list, or about to
be. Dampier’s lease of the Alexandra has run out, and
the big house is not likely to find another tenacious
tenant yet awhile. The Royal is advertised “to be let”
at the conclusion of Bland Holt’s season. Probably the
three surviving managements will have the theatrical
market “proper” to themselves, with only occasional
bursts of opposition, for the next six months.

Frank Cates is net yet laid up in the Alfred Hospital,

a bed engaged for Franky at the Hospital, but its present
occupant is a tedious, undecided sort of person, who

bed for his successor. Last week Cates was still at large,
protesting against the aggravating conduct of “ this

for. P.S.—lt was on Cates’ own authority that we said
he was in Alfred Hospital.

Griffith had a warm time with an unem-

Dancing around his tabic Sam spluttered out:

The disappearance of financier Fogarty
recalls the quiet method adopted .by a Sydney
attorney’s accountant who made tracks a few
years ago. An audit of his books showed a deficit
of £2OOO. He took into his confidence a cabman
whom he had frequently employed, and who
agreed to conceal him in his house for six months.
Meanwhile he grew a big beard, and, when every-
thing was ready, turned his notes into gold, went
to Newcastle, and got away in a coal-ship to South
America.
Last week the New Oriental Bank closed
peacefully and went where the good banks go.
It was built on the ruins of the old Oriental Bank,
which also collapsed some few years ago, so the
name is evidently an unlucky one. The cable-
grammer got into a more than usually irrespon-
sible condition over this incident, and announced
that the collapse would create renewed uneasiness
in England about Australian financial institutions
—which is a remarkable statement, seeing that
the Oriental Bank was itself English, and it is
Australia which ought to feel the uneasiness.
Also, one of the Foreign-trade papers of Sydney
rose at full moon to point out that the smash was
brought about by the malign influences of Pro-
tection, because the defunct institution had
,£300,000 invested in Melbourne, on solid security,
out of over £7, 000,000 of assorted liabilities.
Later on it turned out that the fall was brought
about by the rush of Scotch depositors, so the
collapse was probably owing to Ereetrade, but
that paper has dropped the subject now.
For some hidden reason which will never
be explained till the waste-paper basket gives up
its dead, Sydney Truth allows “ a correspondent ”
to use its columns as a “meejum ” for the follow-
ing. The person alluded to is that common-
place and bumptious person, J. D. Young,
M.L.C., and the thing is evidently m&Sfi for
blank verse :
“Shout!” You bet. The Bulletin has one
question to ask just here —will J. D. Young state
definitely that he didn’t write this himself ? The
thing is so exceedingly like what J. D. Young
obviously thinks of himself, and the blanky verse
is so very like the sort of blank verse that J. IX
Young would produce, judging from the things
we have heard him “ hurl ” at municipal officials
upon whom he was “jumping” in all the pride
and glory of his stupendous power, that it looks
suspicious. Still, in a way, the statements are
true. Mr. Young grabbed the offices of municipal
councillor and transit commissioner, and he
scorned all the rest—probably because he couldn’t
get’em. He is “ fearless in denunciation ” right
enough—anyone who has heard him bang the
table and has listened to his shriek and howl will
endorse this. He does “ hurl defiance ” at nearly
everybody—we seem to hear a hoarse voice
saying “ Gerrout !’* and the voice sounds
very like Young’s. He is “blunt in speech”
beyond the slightest question, for, very often,
he simply asks the other man to “come
outside ” and then sits down. He was in Parlia-
ment for a year or so, and then he was bounced
out, and couldn’t get himself re-elected for West
Sydney—in fact, he never wilL be re-elected.
Leastways we hope not, as we don’t want to see
Parliament made into a heaven for uncultured
rum-sellers. Also, he kept a public-house, and
the other day he was tendered a banquet, at which
every important guest was named Mick—except
one who was named Crick.
He stands—a monument of integrity
Scorning office and bribes —
Ever the friend of the down-trodden poor.
Whose word is his bond—
Respected by all. Fearless
In denunciation of wrong ;
Hurling defiance at cliques and parasites ;
Carefully guards the rights of citizens ;
Just, alike to friend and foe ;
No honeyed words—blunt and pointed in speech—
Seeks not to give offence. Undeviating
From the path of rectitude, whose memory
Will live when others have been long forgot.
With reverence we greet and shout:
“ Long life to J. D. Young,”

Another reason against the Queensland
slave-trade : All the South Sea blacks are required
by the island planters, whose greatest, difficulty is
the local scarcity of labour.
The new Queensland Electoral Bill should
be termed A Measure for the Extinction of the
Working Elector. “ Purging the rolls ” here
means Long live the Dummy Voter.”

iN.S. \\ . Labour Electoral League, it is clear that,
as indicated by The Bulletin a few weeks ago,
nis Honor does not intend re-entering politics.

Likely enough Parkes will elbow, Reid out
of the leadership of the N.S.W. Opposition when
parliament meets. Anyhow, he plainly means to
try—despite the conspiracy of revenge which has
been plainly organised against him by the Sydney
freetrade press.
When it was announced that Playford had
chosen Kingston to succeed Bray as S.A. Chief
Secretary, Major Castine, who intensely desired the
office, forgot his soldierly training and absolutely
wept (no figure of speech, but a real downpour of
tears) on the shoulder of the leader of the Oppo-
sition. ‘ v r
The S.A. Opposition say they have, 29
pledged votes out of a House of 54, including the
Speaker. The Ministry claim 28 supporters, so
there is evidently a discrepancy somewhere. The
present is the fifth no-confidence motion in 12
months, and the Government still survives, though
in a shaky condition.
Blaine will not get in as President. They

Two of Adelaide’s knights have celebrated
their golden weddings during the last few weeks— •

Government before most of his fellow-citizens
were born, and Sir William Milne, once a Presi-
dent of the Legislative Council, who began life as
a bare-footed cow herd.
Whatuau, a big fighter in bis day, and
said to be the oldest half-caste in Maoriland, lias
just died, aged 70. He had a plavful way with
a long-handled tomahawk and in one of the Bay

blow. But the old man preferred not to talk of
these episodes of his frisky youth.
Much uncertainty prevails as to thepropc 1 ’
pronunciation of the name of the ex-Chief Com’
missioner of Victorian railways.—
Some call him Speet, and some say Spate ;
We’re hardly certain which is riprht;
But Syme should know, and he of late
Has always called the party Spite-.
There is A parson in Brisbane whose name
is a household word among the poor on “ the
Downs” where he has spent a large fortune itl
helping others. He lives in a “ hash-house ” dig-
gings now, and draws a third-rate salary at a
second-rate church. Of such is the Kingdom of
Heaven !
Postmaster- General Uumack (Q.) is a
bourgeois of the cold, calculating German type.
He has the eye of a Hebrew bill-discounter, and
the soul of a logarithm. He is the kind of indivi-
dual who carries his “ beeziness brinciples ” home
and sleeps with them and eats with them and goes
to church with them. He is the shopkeeper of the
Queensland Cabinet.
Superintendent Montford, perhaps in-
judiciously, unbuttoned at a recent police festive

W. C. Belhrldge, ’ date Jibrariau ofi! the
S.M. Herajld, who died of cancer -on 10th,iin«b.,i
after a long illness, was originally' apprenticed, in
t fche S. M. Herald office. i’Then, he. became
manager of tlie Melbourne Argus; partnered
with Charles Lilley (now Sir C.) in the old Bris-
bane (Q.) Express ; became Government i miter
of Bananaland; became Parkes’s man m the

drifted back to the lIERAUD in his declining years.
“Dickey” Speight stipulated that he
should be reinstated by the Victorian Government
for 21 hours, and resign after receiving Aid,ooo
compensation. He took .£(5000 without being
reinstated. Part of the £(5000 is understood to
be “ travelling expenses,” but Dicky, it is under-
stood. does not intend to travel, having done so
well in silver and other deals that he feels qhi e
content with Australia. Besides, his friends talk
about; a big testimonial.
Zox, M.P. (Vic.), of the white waistcoat,

Tawhiao, the Maori King, has sold his
birthright to Government for £225 a year, quar-
terly in advance, and a free railway-pass, ta-
whiao is wise. He could not repel the evei-
advaneing locomotive from his territory, so he
has secured his free house, his free pass, and his
pension while there is yet time. Thepoor old
man put in one sawing clause: he told (Native
Minister Cad man he would still call himself Hing.
“This is a free .country,” said .Cadman— call
yourself what you like so long as y ()U bbey the

“ Sir Henry Parkes,” according to the
most recent and neatest of his many interviewers,
“ in his walks wears an old felt hat of enormous
size, with a long peacock’s feather stuck in the
band.” The writer goes on to say:—“David
Blair tells an anecdote relating to the size of Sir
Henry’s head. Forty years ago Blair, Parkes,
and Deniehy were spending an evening together
in Sydney. Blair picked up Parkes’ hat
and put it on. It covered him to the
shoulders, and what Parkes’ hat did to
Blair, Blair’s did to The old
man still keeps up this game. For instance,
over a year ago, while so lame that lie had
almost to be carried into tine hall, he attended a
political meeting aft Paddington which was being
addressed by “Jack” Want. Jack, who has a
big head, as heads go, had left his hat on the table
at which old man Parkes sat, and while the other
was speaking Sir Henry calmly took up the tile
and poised it on one bump of bis own colossal
skull to the great delight of the audience —and the
great discomfiture of the noteasily-abasbed Q.-.C.
The only paper in Adelaide not conducted

Attorney Yon Doussa, at Mount Barker
(S.A.), was cross-examining a fellow German in a
complicated assault ease in which both the parties
were Teutons. “ Ah, Mr. Jaensch,” he said, as
the continued to baffle him, “ it is easy to
gee that the plaintiff is related to you.’ ‘ YaJ
was the replv, “der blaintiff vas mein bruder-m-

tQrls face as be exclaimed sententiously, I
thought so !” “ Yell, dat is notinks,' added the
witness, evidently resenting the emphasis placed
upon the comment, “ (ler defendant vas mein
.cousin.” “ Oh, I daresay,” said the lawyer know-
ingly, “but you think more of the brother-in-law
than the cousin !” The witness put first his right
and then his left fore-finger between bis teeth and
'afterwards.said with an air which carried convic-
tion tp .all who it —“ Look here, Von
Doussa, of I jaite dis finger or of I bite dat finger,

Dear Bulletin, — You had a par recently
, chronicling the physical breakdown of Sir Harry
Atkinson, ex-Premier of Maoriland. Those who
remember the “fighting major” as I remember
him, seven or eight years ago, would be surprised
to bear it. Atkinson, with his rough-hewn face,
shaggy Brows, over-hanging eyes of piercing
Brightness, his stalwart, though somewhat un-
gainly form, his strident, combative voice, and bis
tireless energy, might have been taken as a very
model of middle-aged virility. It was the man’s
very physical tirelessness, more than his un-
doubted ability, that made him, for nearly 20
years, the most prominent figure in M.L. politics.
Grey is a grand old man, ho doubt, but he
coddles himself and saves his strength for an
occasional effort. Atkinson has never spared
himself—he led his party, he whipped for his
' party—in fact, he was his party."" It was Atkm-
-1 son first, all the rest nowhere.' Mitchelson, Dick,
Bryce, and Kolleston, the ablest 6f bis many col-
leagues in many Government's, were mere min-
nows beside the Triton. I' doubt not that the
insane practice of pushing all the parliamentaiy
business of a country like Maoriland into one
short session of 12 or 13 weeks hits had much to do
with the failing of Atkinson’s health. Fancy,
committee-work from 10 to 12.30. House from
2.30 p.m. till the same hour or later the following
morning, and that routine five <1 a week!
’Twas Atkinson who made the parliamentary
Juggernaut move on at this fatal speed, IMany it
crushed, and now even his own fine constitu-
tion is'a sacrifice.—Yours, Timi Piripi.

Australia. About 10 months back in England the
lovely daughter of poor but haughty parents
married a man in business much to the “ family’s ”
horror. The business person had lucre, of course,
and he brought his bride to Australia on a pro
tracted honeymoon, hoping that his exalted but
dead-broke parents-in-law would appreciate the
advantages of the match when the baker and the
batcher began to talk bailiff. The young couple
put up at a fashionable Melbourne hotel, but they
left again with much suddenness. The boots at
the hotel happened to be a disreputable brother of
the bride’s. He had disappeared from ’Ome after
serving a term for smashing a man’s skull over a
game of cards.

The Sydney woman-sulfragists have been
trotting out once more that hoary story about the
smaller percentage of female criminals than of
male. What becomes of the notion if we deduct
from the masculine record the crimes of violence
which women can’t commit, and the commercial
offences for which they don’t get the chance ?

Lord and Lady Hopetoun are not in
especial favour with the Melbourne Liedertafels
because they fidget and yawn fearfully at the
concerts, and sit up in the gallery instead of
making a glittering spectacle of themselves in the
front seats. The Lochs used to vice-regalise in
the place of honour and applaud the part songs
with great vigour, like the wily old soldiers that
they were. As for giddy deputy-Governor Robin-
son, well the Liedertafel fellows simply doated on
him, and serenaded him once or twice. If he were
to come back to Melbourne and die, they would
roll up to his funeral like one man. “Father, in
thy gracious keeping now we leave Sir William
sleeping,” sung by 500 voices would be most
impressive. Not that there is any fear of Robin-
son passing away yet awhile.

One of the suspended Australian “ financial
institutions,” was making frantic efforts to obtain
an extension of time from the duped depositor.
The usual additional audit was ordered, and
officials were hard at work giving the paper assets
some touch of reality. The Co.’s solicitor had, of
course, his own little overdraft—covered by a bill-
of-sale over some furniture. “ Make the schedule
look large,” said Satan’s son; so, with a great
flourish, an additional line was given for the fry-
ing-pan and another for the poker. The working
expenses of this very company are equal to 38 per
cent, of its capital. A long period of grace has
been granted, and yet the depositors expect to get
their money returned.
At the Governor’s levee on 24th May a
recently-elected member of Parliament was driven
up to Government House, Brisbane, by a Kanaka
coachman. This is what ThE Bulletin calls
“ rubbing it in.”

Australian vice regal residence very soon. Lady

At Montalbion, N.Q. . when Gov. Norman
went through, a “native” (white) stalked up :
“ Are you Mr. Norman, the Governor?” “Well,
yes.” “ Will you shake hands with a feller?”
They shake. “You’re not half a blanky sort of
bad blank to be a Governor, after all! ”
In the free and easy districts of Bananaland one
may live years with mates and only know
them as “ Blower Bill,” “Lanky Joe,” “ Yorky,”
“Bandy Peter,” and so on. Hence, let not
the following be deemed a romance. Governor
Norman was at Herberton, and Herberton’s
Mayor, himself officially admitted within the
circle of vicc.-regal champagne-corks, produced a
friend. “ Yer Exe’llency, permit me to introduce
to you one of our pioneers, known to all the dis-
trict as a thorough white man, my old friend Mr.
—c*r—er—my old friend—er—Mup Sandy ! ” At a
small town on the Oloncurry, the leading man
didn’t worry at all, but simply brought his friends
up one after the other— “Yer Ex’leuoy, Joe
Bango ; yer Ex’lency, Bucking Bob ; yer Ex’leucy,
BarC ooted Peter &c., &c. And his Ex. said he
rather preferred it that way.

Dear Bulletin*- Civilisation progresses in
the West. My friend the chemist having absented
himself for a game of billiards, I was rather un-
willingly left in charge of the shop, a short time
ago, when in walked a western crazier and asked
in a remarkably hesitating and timid way : “ Do
you sell any tooth-brushes?” “Oh, yes; what
sort would you like ? Soft ones, hard ones, or
here are very good electric ones, or “Oh,
pick me a good one yourself I ” At once I
“ dropped ” to the fact that my customer was a
better judge of merinoes than of tooth-brushes, and,
selecting the oldest instrument in stock, I care-
fully handled it so as not to shake out any bristles,
when my customer said with continued hesitation *
“ Got any tooth-powder?” “ Oh, yes ; which do
you prefer? There is pearl-ash, and carbolic
powder, and camphorated chalk and .” “ Oh,
pick mo a good brand yourself.” This was my
chance at last to dispose of the big, old jar of
Japanese tooth-powder, the ugliness of which had
been an eyesore to me for a long time, and which
I knew the chemist had unsuccessfully tried to sell
for 10s. right through all the years of the silver-
boom. I had no trouble to persuade my man that
this, though costly, was the only article a gentle-
man could use, and I was just starting to make a

Is Australia a democratic country ? When
Governor Jersey paid his recent visit to Bal-
ranald (N.S.W.) the other day and was invited to
take a black-handled knife and a fork with three
prongs at a banquet, the local srtobs had a troubled
time. Accordirrg to usage, tiro Mayor should
have presided, but that official is a blacksmith,
and the manly trade of horse-shoeing is low and
common, so he was ejected, by acclamation, and
the P.M. presided in his stead. Years ago, when
Governor Loftus made a progress trp country he
struck a town where tire Mayor was a barber, yet
apparently the people weren’t ashamed of him.
Anyhow, the shampoo man came out in full regalia
and welcomed His Ex., and then Lord Augustus,
being rather bristly about the chin, wentalong to his
little shop, and his worship shaved him, and half-
talked him to death, and washed his head, and cut
him on the chin; and after that he got into his
robes of State and presided at the banquet, and
made a neat speech; and the ex-ambassador got up
with the gash still on his lower jaw, and responded
cordially. No doubt the heavens ought to have
fallen, but they didn’t—in fact, they keep up to
tins day. The barber went into Parliament, and
if Loftus had only stayed a little longer in
N.S.W. they might have met again when the ex-
threepenny-sliave man came up with an "Address-
iu-Reply.”
Let us hope that when the Mayor of Balranalcl
comes to Sydney Governor Jersey will ostenta-
tiously invite him to dine at Government House;

Dear Bulletin Yob are down heavily
on poetic wattle-blossom, and with reason. In
verse it has lost its beauty and long since dis*
sipated its odour. It needs a rest. But what
about the mopoke that “laughs” and “gurgles”
and the ’possum that runs about in the daylight ?
Why doesn’t somebody jump heavily on the brick-
and-mortar poet who makes the miserable moping
owl and the nocturnal phalangor do these things ?
The melancholy “pope-pope” of the former is
about as much like laughter as the nasal “quaw ”
of the wood-duck, and I don’t see why the latter
should be so invidiously neglected. Then again
there is the long, festive “whish” of the native
cat, and the vocal jocularity of the jolly native
bear. Why do tire poets leave them out in the
cold ? —Crosscut.
Evidently when Lord Glasgow accepted
work as Governor of Maoriland he didn’t know
what awaited him at Wellington. His aide wired
from Melbourne to have the beds aired, and the
Cabinet hadn’t the nerve to telegraph back that
there weren’t any beds, and that the house was
quite empty, so when K.E. arrives he will pro*
b.ibly sit down on the bare floor with a look of
considerable astonishment. The furniture was,
in former days, supplied at the expense of the
Treasury, bat owing to the fearful row which Gov.
Bowen made over a baby’s bassinette, or some*
thing of the sort, it was decided that each poten-
tate must lay in his own tables and chairs for the
future. Nobody explained this to Glasgow, how-
ever, and when lie gets there his wife will pro*
bably have to run out for some sausages, while the
Governor himself borrows a frying-pan from the
woman in the next house, and the aide knocks up
a fire and prepares a sort of scrambling feed on
the mantelpiece. As for sleeping accommodation
the Earl will either have to sit on a hat-box beside
the fire for the first night or else sleep the best way
he can in a corner. There ought to be some
tolerably strong language that day in the Glasgow
family—especially if the Governor is out in the
back yard looking for wood at two a.in. and falls
heavily over a root.

This is the way they make divorce-evidence

to you as likely to give me some points.” “ Cer-
tainly. Come inside.” “Thanks —can’t stay just
now, but if you’ll join me in a couple of hours at
the Snake-in-the-Grass Hotel, we’ll have a liquor
and talk things over.” Blank keeps appointment,
is introduced to a “ friend,” has numerous drinks,
and is carted off to finish the evening at the
friend’s house in the suburbs. He is shown into
a room, the friends beg to be excused for a moment
and vanish, whereupon a dishevelled young person
glides in and flings herself upon Blank’s manly
bosom. Enter then three strangers, one of whom
loquitur —“ Your name’s John Blank? Mine’s
Slush, private detective; and these men are
witnesses that I find you on these excellent terms
with a woman in a house of ill-fame !” There was
no get-away from that. Mrs. Blank got her

The case of Kate Butler, recently tried on
a charge of bigamy, at Newcastle (N.S.W.),
revealed a curiously free-and-easy state of tilings
on the part of everybody concerned. The defen-
dant, at the age of 16, was married to a miner
named Croxall, and at the marriage a document
was handed in setting forth that tho girl was 18
years of age. that her father was dead, and that
her mother consented to the marriage. Croxall
swore that he took this paper to the mother, and
that she signed it, and the mother swore that she
didn’t sign it, and that she knew nothing about
the marriage. The father was not dead, and all
the parties to the transaction were aware of tho
fact, but none of them seemed to know who was
responsible for the statement to the contrary. The
pair lived together for three weeks, and then the
bride went home and never came back. The
bride’s father “had heard of the first marriage,”
but didn’t regard it as being legal, and tie and his
wife were both present at the second marriage.
The defendant acknowledged both marriages, but
swore that her first husband threatened to shoot
her, and she only married him to avoid being shot.
Then the Judge directed the jury to find a verdict
of guilty, and the jury rose up unanimously and
found a verdict of not guilty. Whereupon the
Crown Prosecutor asked the Judge to warn the
first husband that he wasn’t at liberty to marry
ao-ain, and the Judge declined to inteifeie. Also,
he remarked that lie had been “ insulted ” by the
jury and retired in a state of considerable indigna-
tion.

Smokers arc divided into two classes.
There is the ordinary plain smoker whose sole
ambition is to take a certain amount of smoke into

out again—most Australians belong to this ctass -
and tlie fancy or ornamental smoker who takes in
a whitf and thin sends it forth via his ears, or.
doesn’t send it forth at all, but simply keeps it in
his system, or who takes in a long, satisfying puff
and then discharges it through Ids boots. There
is a Frenchman belonging to this class in Sydney,
and he is a fearsome man to know. You may
meet him in the evening when he isn’t smoking,
and converse with him, and he looks just like an
ordinary man. Tlien you can go to the theatre
with him, and .sit out a five-act Horror, and have
drinks between each act, and lie won’t manifest
the slightest desire to smoke all the time. And
when the five-act Horror is over you can go with
him and have an oyster supper, and after the
supper the chances are that he will lean back in
his chair, and slowly blow a long blue cloud out
through his teeth with an air of absolute un-
concern. It is the last whiff of tlie,cigar that he
finished before you met him some five hours previ-
ously, and after putting the drinks and the
oysters on top of it ho brings it out from under-
neath that load of provender as good as new.
He is quite harmless, but most people, when they
see him first, suspect him of spontaneous com-
bustion, or of having sold himself to the Devil.

Answers to Correspondents .
No notice will be taken of communications Which arrivi
at this office insufficiently stamped:
‘‘(JfCilia S.” i It is hard to churh up much
sentiment over the ungainly eucalyptus; anyhow this
time you end with a terrific anti-climax. Try something
else “M.G.F.H.” (B;): Thants, but we have many
Australian almanacs of very much earlier Bate....
W.E.C.” (Paddington): Unsuitable. Lack originality;
....“Winkle”: Unsuitable, though but very photo-
graphic....“ M.D.” : Subject dead and damned
“ Lex” : Kindly call ... “ P.L.” (M.M.): Letter posted..
“ M.D.” : Good story... “C.-I.IL”; The field is a most
uncertain one, and is lit neither for the man without
capital) nor for him who has anything to lose “A. 13.” ;
If you can show a magistrate a prima-faeie case, lie will
grant you summonses for perjury against prosecutor and
lus witnesses... “ Deadshot” ; Returned some time back
....“The Orphan”; Will usei Phase send name and
address, mentioning the subject of your communication...
“ G.A;” (Sals. P.C.) :To hand.,,. “ A.Mill.” (A;): Thanks
for clippings : chiefly of English interest, however ...
“Roy Kerr’S Good sentiment, but your enthusiasm
exceeds your power of expression....“ Culloden M.” :
Yes, three acts ; Ist, Trader and llennessy (or substitute);
2nd, Missionary and the secret of England’s greatness
(commonly' known as the Bible); and 3rd—well, exit
niggers—God save the Queen !....“ J.G.IJ.” (Inverell) s
Order for book sent to Gordon and Gotch....“ E.”: Never
such fierce contention over a novel as with regard to
Hardy’s “Tess” “ A.J.”: “Copy” should be in by-
Monday if possible “11. Edwards”; An enormous
amount of the French indemnity to Germany was paid in
train-loads of solid gold, some of which identical coin is
salted away in the fortress of Spandau to this day, await-
ing the next grand scrimmage that may descend upon
the German empire...." S.M. E.” (M.L.) : Will read..,.
“ J.M.S.” : Very acceptable..“ Hurra Michie” : Your
pen name means “make haste,” but you haven’t murra
michie’d much in telling your story, which is long drawn-
out and is, after all, only' remindsome of Bret Harte’s
Heathen Chinee yarn “A.W.8.”: Only of strictly
local interest, and we can’t irritate thousands for the sake
of pleasing a few- scores “ J. Krow ” : Thanks, but not
a very palatable story. Please call if about “ C.G.8.” :
Too placid and old-worldish for The Bulletin. Try
a heavy weekly..... “R.P.T.”: Only a variation of the
grey-whiskered, bald-headed old story. Such a title as
“A Sundowner’s Death” would damn “ In Memorial)!.”
Please write about the sundowner w hile he’s still alive and
in quest of rations... “Holly.” Haven’t seen picture,
but w-e don’t think Phil. May ever had time to do that
sort of w-ork, which would certainly be at variance with
his tastes “VV.T.” (Bel.): Thanks, but the Millais
story is very well-known “W.S.”: We can’t tell until
we see it. Use your own judgment and send along any-
thing of interest.... “ Gundaroo” : Why should we print
a portrait of the church bellringer—who rang the bell per
medium of a coat-strap round his dog’s loins?
“ W.T.D.” (N.): Why not condense?... “ U.D.” (G.):
Lovely “Nymagee”: Many thanks “J.W.S.”:
Much obliged “R.H.”: Such a memo would, if pro-
perly witnessed, bo perfectly legal and effective....
“J. Krow”; Pondering. .. “S.H.R.” (Melb.): The mor-
phia was a mere}-. Granted that death, disgraceful death,
is inevitable, let them have morphia all the time., .
“Amos Jones”: The Bogan election, for instance, shows
what the Single-tax organisation has done for the labor
cause in N.S.W. up to now. Freetrade first, labor after-
wards is their motto.. .“Peter Block”: “Ace, king,
queen, jack and ten ” wins.... “ J. 0.” (H.): All accounts
to be sent to accountant, not to editor “Winkle”:
Received . “A.J.8.” (Stanmore): Humorous in spots,
but the beginning is so solemn that no one would ever
get to the spots.... “ W.E.1.” : The poet who contributes
a “ lay ” may be high-toned, but the man w ho only sends
in a screed always writes better verse. Yours is a “ lay.”
... “J.N.F.” (Mildura); Whether Englishmen “hate
their native land” or not isn’t worth discussing hero.
England is very far off, and it isn’t our funeral .. ,“W.
Kelly”; Thanks “S.J.” (Gymbowen): Don’t rattle
the skeleton of that old wheeze at r.s anymore. The
same thick and slab incident has done s ivice in forty
novels “ Northerner ” : A snake 40 feet long isn’t
necessarily funny, and a snake 80 feet long isn’t neces-
sarily more funny. Even the longest snake may have a
hidden grief at his vitals... “Bushman”: Why hit a
politician who is already fiat?... “ Ake ake kia kal.u ”:
Even if a daily paper clod did rise on his wobblesome
hind-legs and state that no Maoriland pressman is any
good, it isn’t worth disproving the statement. Yon
should merely pity the ignorance of a poor fat man, and
pass on “ J.C.8.” (Braidwood): Thank’s. If the tale
about the man starved to death in a native-bear trap
wasn’t true, it was a nice, cheerful lie, which is about as
g00d....“ Alma ”; Same old plot. He was found
guilty on the unsupported statement of the swarthy
villain, and then years rolled on, and after that
he was proved innocent on the bare statement
of the funny man, and was happy ever after.
“ Scot”: (1) You object to The Bulletin’s remarks about
English wife-beaters partly on account of something that
might have been and partly on account of something
entirely irrelevant which “some girls” told you. We
speak from personal knowledge. Look at Coghlan’s
statistics and see how the Englishman looms up—in pro-
portion to population—among the brutal assaults. (2)
Every time The Bulletin says anything about England
some driveller sends along the chestnut: “ Its an ill bird,”
&c. We don’t come from Bull-land and it isn’t our nest
“ Banderillo ” : Your poetry is of a rugged, explosive,
rock-blasting variety, and seems to he composed with a
club “ 5.8.” (Sydney) : Why do you send ns a mis-
quoted hunk of badly-written Stiakcsbacon on a scrap of
dirty paper?. .. “A.C.”: Only two bald Scotchmen and
some bagpipes “Native Bear” (Seymour): Much
obliged... “The Idler”: Your gentle little love-warble
is declined ; it is soft and very swret, something like an
angel when she is boiled... “ R.F.8.” (Sydney); You are
too elevated. When a threepenny omnibus goes along
with two old crowbaits in the shafts you start; “Chariots
laden with power and wealth roll on.” Why not simply
say “Busses pass?” “ A.T.G.” (Canterbury): You start
“Awake my muse,” and that settles it right there. The
man who says “Awake rny muse” is no good
“Motadam”: The poet that makes “story” rhyme
with “jaw he,” is too astonishing to be taken in one lot.
You should unscrew yourself and come in instalments ...
“ W.D.H.” (Frecmantlc): No one can write verse w ithout
ideas, and you will never have any for want of the neces-
sary apparatus... “Thistles”: As you justly observe,
the story contains C2O words. It doesn’t contain any-
thing.else “Pique”: Yes! Precisely! Just 50!....
“Ararnac”: We like your joke—in fact, we like it so
much that we made it ourselves months ago .. “Ben
Sun ”: That Chinaman is exhausted. Six poets have
been at him already, and he has been trodden to death by
wild Miltons “ Exile ” (Adelaide): Received with thanks.
“ J.11.A.” (Wellington, M.L.); Boil it down. Don’t give
the full genealogy of your characters merely because one
said something funny and (he other heard him say it but
didn’t answer “J. Sampson”: You don’t even
mention whether the case was tried irt Australia,
Maoriland, or where, and you give no dates
or names. Send report from local paper
“Vagrant”: Why did he bolt from his sweetheart and
all his friends simply because he had been tipsy ? Also,
why did no one inquire about (he dead body that was
buried in the hush ?,...“ Beryl ” ; Have tried hard to
patch your poem, but it won’t patch. Idea good ; metre
appalling....“ M.S.” (Hobart); Will consider.... “ D.H.”
(Parker’s Range); We can only say that our informant
was a well-known journalist who claimed to have had a
long personal acquaintance with the politician in ques-
tion. ... “ Belial ” : What harm has Mr. David S done
you that you write “poems” stating that he is “too
irideous for hell?”. . “J.A.K” (Dundas): An inferior
sea-yarn badly t01d... “Panta” (Sydney): Hardly suit-
able .. “L.11.H.” (Brisbane): Will consider “The
Waif”: Not suitable; also, half the stories we get pro-
fess to be told at the camp-fire by a tall, bearded man,
with a sad expression. Leave the bearded man out,
and tell the story yourself. ..“Ajax”; Very long and
sad, like the shadow of a dry hone in a sun-blasted land ..
“ F.M.H.” (Carlton): Will read.... “ Yrrehs ” : Pathetic,
but the same pathos and the same story and the same
bones have been used oxer and over again.... “Jerry ” :
When your Irish peasant givis a “ ball,” and there is a
snowstorm and a harvest at the same time it looks too
disjointed..* G. 8.” (no address); Received with thanks.

Ned’s Delicate Way.
[FOR THE BULLETIN]
Ned knew I was short of tobacco one day,
And that I was too proud to ask for it;
He hated such pride, but Ins delicate way
Forbade him to take me to task for it.
I loathed to be cadging tobacco from Ned,
But, when I was just on the brink of it :
“ I’ve got a new brand of tobacco,” he said —
“Try a smoke, and let’s know what you think
of it.”

From London Weekly Bulletin :—
As showing the terrible deprivations our aristocracy arc
now' going through, I may say that Messrs. F. M. Prime
& Co., of Smithfleld Market, showed me one day last
week an entry of a basket of strawberries, bought for and
eaten by the Marquis of Lome (when at Bradford), the
cost per ounce being 4s., or of the basket £1 4s. I need
say no more. This is why the nation rots or dies, I say.
We pay this wretched specimen of the human race, or his
wife, £6,000 a year, so that he can buy strawberries at
£1 4s. a basket, whilst the miserable tax-payer dies in the
gutter or suicides wholesale ! And we profess to wonder

down, and the present writer has ever predicted that the

We are indeed a nation of sportsmen, remarks
The Bulletin’s London correspondent. The Orme cult
is now the vogue. The news of the illness of the Duke of
Westminster’s Derby favourite came like a thunderbolt
upon London, and the consternation created thereby was
almost beyond belief. Women’s Suffrage Bibs; Ulster
threatening of civil war over Home llule; even the
Anarchist outrages in France paled into insignificance
before the fact that the great Orme had a sore throat, and
that Loefller, the horse-dentist, had extracted one ot its
teeth The papers publish daily bulletins of the horse s
condition, and as I write I have before me a spi cial edit ion
of an evening paper containing a telegram, signed West-
minster,’ stating that “ Onne’s condition is it anything
better. His Grace remains at Kingsclerc in attendance

There is a body called the “ Sports’ Protection
Association ” in Maoriland, with which the various athletic
clubs are affiliated. This association undertakes that a
man who is in arrears in any way to any club will net be
allowed to take part in any sport till his debts aie paid.
Recently, a leading representative footballer and athlete
was “posted,” and forthwith became bankrupt. It was
claimed for him that his bankruptcy cleared his club
subscriptions like his other debts, but the association
decided otherwise: they will not recognise bankruptcy,
and nothing hut payment in full will enable an\ man
“ posted ” to take part in any sport.

HIS EXCELLENCY LORD ONSLOW
SPEAKS UP FOR
Mother Mary Joseph Auhert.
In a letter to Dr. De La Bachoue :
[Com:.]
Wellington, 18th. Septembre, 1891.
Mon Cher Docteur,—
Je vous dois de la reconnaisance pour les con-
sultations que vous m’avez donnees m’engageant
a essayer les remedes extraits des plantes de la
N.Z. prepares par la R. Mere Marie Joseph
Aubert. J’en ai fait usage pendant quelque
temps, et je puis vous affinner que je m en suit
parfaitment trouve. Ils sont toniques et forti-
fiants.
Veuillez transrnettre mes felicitations a la R.
Mere an sujet de ses travaux. Ils sont d’une
grande valeur pour le soulagement des miseres
humaines, me paraissant susceptibles d’ajouter
aux industries de la colonie, et devoir etre en
meme temps profitables aux bonne ceuvres dont
elle poursuit la realisation.
Agreez, mon cher Docteur, i’assurance de mes
sentiments distingues.
ONSLOW.
Dr. de L. Bachoue,
Consulat Francais, Wellington.
[Translation.]
Wellington,
18th. September, 1891.
My Dear Doctor,—
I feel grateful to you for your advice to try the
remedies extracted from New Zealand plants, and
prepared by the Rev. Mother Mary Joseph
Aubert. I have used them for some time, and I
am in a position to inform you that I have found
them perfectly satisfactory. They are really tonic
and fortifying.
Be good enough to convey to the Rev. Mother
my congratulations on her labours; they are of
great value for the relief of human miseries, and
appear to me capable of furthering colonial
industry, and should at the same time be profit-
able to those good works which she seeks to
realise.
Accept, my dear doctor, the assurance of my
appreciative feelings.
(Signed) ONSLOW.
Dr. de La Bachoue,
French Consulate, Wellington.
RESUSCITATION.
Everyone who has been attacked with the
prevailing epidemic of Influenza, knows that it is
very lowering to the system, and that a general
feeling of weakness permeates all through the
body.
Now, it is highly necessary that some Tonic
Medicine should be taken to bring the system up
to its proper standard, because, if not immediately
attended to, more serious complaints may develop,
and cause a large amount of unnecessary misery.
His Excellency Lord Onslow has communicated
the fact to Mother Mary Joseph Aubert that the
remedy, Karana, as prepared by herself, is, in his
opinion, and from his own experience in taking
same, a perfect tonic and very fortifying, and the
public may rest assured that the Governor of this
Colony would not give testimony unless he
was well aware that it was correct.
Those persons who are troubled with a Cough,
as an after effect from influenza, are particularly
requested to give Marcpa a fair trial, and it will
be found that benefit will result.
It may be as well to mention here that thes e
Remedies are not cheap and nasty preparations;
but are made up in such concentrated form that
they may, at first sight, appear expensive, but
this is not so, as, from the very many flattering
testimonials which have been received, the pro-
prietor is confident that value is being given, and
that only good results follow with those persons
who have given the Remedies a trial.
No medicines previously introduced into New
Zealand have reached a total sale of eighteen
thousand bottles in four months, and yet this has
been done by Mother Mary Joseph Aubert.
Kindly remember that Karana is invigorating
to the system, and that Mari; pa will successfully
combat with any Cold, Cough or Bronchial
Affection.
HE CALLED
WITH AN
ITEM
FEW things will raise Cain in a man quicker
than to feel that he has been “had.” A
person very often will make no objection to doing
a thing deliberately, but if he finds himself
unwarily let into the commission of the same act,
his whole nature rebels, and he lays himself out to
misapply all the Sunday words he has ever
learned. We had an experience like this the
other day. A bull-headed, knock-kneed, semi-
clerical looking stranger intruded his shiny
countenance around the corner of our sanctum
door, and in response to an urbane invitation to
step in, proceeded to do so, having first carefully
wiped his feet on the spot usually assigned to the
door-mat. “I called to give you an item,” he
commenced, bestowing his plug hat on one chair,
and himself on another. “ A friend of mine,” he
went on impressively, “has just died in the New
England district under very peculiar circum-
stances. He got himself mixed up with a chaff-
cutter or a steam plough, or something, and is
now—is now—well, really 1 can hardly venture
to say where he is now; but no matter. Got that
down ? Well, he was a married man with fourteen
young children. Got that down? Well, sir, this
large family is left totally unprovided for. Think
of that! without a penny piece ! No, sir, I am
not collecting for the widow. I merely wished to
draw your attention to the melancholy facts of the
case. Oh, sir, how true it is that in the midst of
life we are in death! Got that down? Perhaps
you would like to know whether the deceased was
insured ? My dear sir, that is the sad part of it—
he was not! Now, if he had been insured in a
good office such as the one I have the honor to
represent, how different! Got that down?” We
had; and while he closed his eyes to call up a
further effort, we softly rose and “ got down ” the
office club from its convenient peg, and the five
minutes on the staircase that followed were
probably the loveliest that any insurance fiend
ever experienced in a newspaper office. We are
wonderfully wiry for our years and supple of
joint, thanks to the invigorating and remedial
properties of St. Jacobs Oil. It infallibly
conquers pain, and grants a new lease of life with-
out any of its woes to the rheumatic or neuralgic
sufferers.
DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
The art of economising is one that, like all
others, may be cultivated. Economy does not
imply “pinching” or niggardliness. There is a
wide difference between true economy and the
spurious quality that demands the denial of
reasonable luxuries and the pleasures of a comfort-
able existence. It is the miser who afflcts himself,
and sins against Nature, in order that he may
hoard up wealth —most probably to be spent in
prodigality after his death. Prudence and a
judicious management of capital—the avoidance
of reckless or unnecessary expenditure—are
principal amongst the elements of true economy.
As a practical illustration let it be assumed that a
man wishes to buy a watch. What he needs to
look to is, firstly, that the watch is a good time-
keeper ; secondly, that it has a presentable appear-
ance ; and, thirdly, (the above qualities being
undeniably assured), that the price is reasonably
within his means. Now, there is but me class of
watch in the world that fits this description,
and that is the Waterbury. The Water -
burys are par excellence “ the people’s time-
keepers,” a fact that every wearer of them cheer-
fully acknowledges. They are manufactured to
suit all incomes and every class of purchaser.
Series “E,” the old long-wind favourite, a tho-
roughly reliable and serviceable watch, costs only
13s. fid. Series “J” (gent’s size), and “L”
(ladies’ size), are retailed at 225. fid., and, amongst
other improvements, are fitted with short-winding
and stem-setting appliances and enamelled dials.
More highly finished still are the latest additions
to the Waterbury family, series “K” and “N,”
for gentlemen and ladies respectively. These can
be obtained in nickel, sterling silver, or rolled
gold (with 15 years’ guarantee). In appearance,
finish, and utility they are incomparable, while
they are offered at prices that must astonish
everybody.


WHAT IS TO BE WORN?

the all absorbing topics of conversation amongst
Ladies, and, with their kind permission, we pur-
pose assisting them in their deliberations.

The Duke of Buccleuch.
An old story in new verse.
There once was a bull named the Duke of liucolcuch
Whose hide it was shiny, whose blood it was blue,
He was shipped to Australia stud-dutv lo do,
Was this highly-priced bovine, the Duke of Buccleuch.
And a lord-loving cableman sent out a line
To announce to Australia its visitor fine,
But if it was human, or if it was kine,
Was left quite in doubt—merely “Duke of Buccleuch.' 1
And Sydney lickspittledom went off its head
As the news round the club-room like lightning did
spread:
A jook, a live jook, and perhaps he ain’t wed !
Bet us hasten to welcome the Duke of Buccleuch !
When the steamer arrived, the crowd it was great,
And Circular Quay seemed to be quite eiifete ;
And the Gov. ho was there in vice-regal state
To receive his old pal the Duke of Buccleuch.
And the Mayor w'as there, too, with a speech in bis hand
To read to the Duke as he stepped on the land,
And spruce Dan O’Connor, a-smiling so bland,
All ready to cheer for the Duke of Buooleuch.
And Railway-Commissioner Eddy was there
All properly clobbered, with nicely-brushed hair,
And he had in his pocket—oh, courtesy rare—
A gold-edged free-pass for the Duke of Buccleuch.
There was horror, confusion, a frightful “ to do ”
How the larrikins laughed—and the jeers from the crew 1
And the maidens and matrons shame-facedly flew,
When they learnt ’twas a bull—the great Duke of
Buccleuch.

The lock-up cells at Boulia (Q ) have a
frontage to the main street. Th ed.t. incarcerants
spend their days straining themselves out of the
windows and yelling at the passers-by in raucous
tones, “For God’s sake, old man, get’s a

The other day a Sydney man named
Hoekaday received a letter posted in England and
intended for a brother of his who resides in an
English village named Lydney. It was addressed
“Mr. Hockaday, Lydney,” but the mistake of
the post-office people in reading “L” for “S”
gave the missive an unpremeditated journey of
12,000 miles or so.
One of the features ot the Wellington
(M.L.) tug-of-war was an aged Maori lady, who
pervaded the big hall and barracked for the Irish
team. Apparently she took no interest in any of
the others, but whenever the Irishmen appeared
she cheered vociferously, and when they got hold
of the rope and gained the first inch or two, her
yells were fearful to listen to. Everybody thought
she must have broken a blood-vessel in that
stupendous effort, but, later on, when the Micks
made a terrific pull and got a foot advantage, she
gathered herself up and rent the heavens with
such howls as nobody had ever heard or dreamt of
before, and after that she screamed right on to the
end. She was a stout lady, with a tinge of red
in her hair. Possibly some wandering Pixelim
O’Toole of the past days got stranded in Taranaki
and married Hinemoa, and it was his grand-
daughter who had turned out to barrack for ould
Erin long after The O’Toole was dead and Hine-
moa was forgotten.
Judge “Water-Jug” Foster (N.S.W.)
visited the House of Commons, the other day, got
a seat in the Distinguished Strangers’ gallery, and
was par’d in the evening papers—as a grandson
of the last Speaker of the Irish Parliament.
Water-Jug, who is a red-hot Orangeman, was to
attend the great anti-Homo Rule meeting of Ulster
bigots, who, by the way, choose to ignore the
fact that every Irish rebellion, even that of ’98,
has been headed by staunch Protestants, and that
all the peaceful movements for Irish emancipation
have had Catholics at the head of them. Of
course it must have followed that in a country
where the Catholics outnumbered the Protestants
by 12 to one the rank-and-file of the rebels must
have been recruited from the larger body, but it
must not be forgotten that the Protestant party
was largely represented in the rebel ranks, too. It
is simply sickening, therefore, to hear people who
have never opened a history of Ireland solely asso-
ciating rebellion with Roman Catholicism, and
talking about handing over the “loyal minority ”
to the tender mercies of the R.C. priesthood. It
is interesting to recall, by the way, that it was the
father of Daniel O’Connell, “the Liberator,” who
informed the Irish Government of the arrival in
Bantry Bay of the French fleet which had been
invited over by Protestant rebels.
Mr. Harry Vane Milbank, who shot the
Due de Morny in a duel at Ostend a few weeks
ago, could have held his own with Ainby Bodkin,
Fighting Fitzgerald, or any other of the famous
Irish duellists of old. Milbank, who is a son of
the famous .sporting man, Sir Frederick Milbank,
whose battues are world-renowned, is a dead shot
with a pistol and he brought down the poor Duke
at the first attempt. He has already killed three
men in duels: one an attache to the Russian
Embassy in Berlin who objected to his paying tc o
much attention to his wife. Next he shot the
lady’s brother, who had the temerity to challenge
him, and then he killed the brother of his first
victim who sought satisfaction. Now that he has
winged, if not killed, a popular French Duke he
will probably be left severely alone, unless by some
one who is tired of life. Many years ago Milbank
fell desperately in love with a beautiful Australian
young lady, but her friends would not allow her
to marry him owing to his notorious liaison with
the well-known cocotte Mabel Grey, and he took
this so much to heart that he completely went to
the dogs. The late Duke of Cleveland designated
him as his principal heir, but Master Harry has
carried on such top ropes of late years on the
continent that the old gentleman altered his mind,
and left a great portion of his vast estate to Mil-
bank’s brother instead, so it is still in the family.

r HTS Company is formed with the object of establishing Refrigerating Works at the various grazing centres of New
I South Wales, for the purpose of freezing and exporting meat to the London and other markets, and there to establish
Depots with cooling chambers for its reception and disposal.
The establishment of this Company will supply a long-felt want to the pastoralists of New South Whiles, by providing a
market for their vast amount of surplus stock, which is increasing, and is of the most paramount importance to all stock owners
that there should be a market for it without any avoidable delay, so that the rapidly increasing surplus of fat stock should find
a profitable outlet through its agency.
It is to be hoped that all stock owners and others interested in the welfare of the colony will take a practical share in
establishing this Company on a sound and lasting basis, as by so doing they will reap substantial profits, directly and indirectly,
upon theirlnvestments, and establish an industry which will prove a great boon to the colony,
' No contracts of any kind have been entered into, and the whole of the future arrangements as to the erection of the
Refrigerating Works, etc., are in the hands of the shareholders. The Company will be entirely managed by the shareholders,
who will have the appointment of the Directors and all other officials.
The whole of the capital paid up will be placed to the credit of the Company, less brokerage of five per cent, on the
subscribed capital.
Shares will be allotted in order of priority of application.
Prospectuses, application forms, and all information can be obtained from the Solicitors of the Company, or from Messrs.
D’Arcy Brothers, Brokers, Scott Chambers, 96 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Gentlemen willing to be on the Provisional Board of this Company will please forward their names and addresses in
full to the Brokers.
The Railway Commissioners have written to the Brokers their willingness to supply Refrigerating Cars for the transit
of the frozen 'meat from the works to the ship’s side.
It is proposed to put works in Yass, Wagga, Hay, Cooma, Forbes or Orange, Bourke, Tamworth, Deniliquin, Dubbo or
Willino’ton, Newcastle, and such other centres as the shareholders may decide so as to embrace the whole of the colony.
To open Cooling Chambers and Australian Stores in London, there to sell the meat retail.
Lord Carrington is at present advocating in London the support of the Lords and Noblemen of England for Australian
meat and negotiations are in progress between the brokers and Mr. J. C. Rounding, representing Messrs. Westgarth & Co.,
Colonial Financiers, London, to place half the capital on the London market.

Du. Hall says : Let it be distinctly understood
that this is no scheme of quackery to draw money
out of the afflicted, nor is it any sort of a patent
medicine humbug, since there is not a grain of
medicine of any kind required in the treatment.
Notwithstanding this fact it takes directly hold of
the worst cases of dyspepsia, liver complaints,
headaches, constipation, heart disease, incipient
consumption, diabetes and Bright’s disease of the
kidneys, including fevers and inflammation of the
lungs, and of other internal organs—not by
attacking these so-called diseases directly, but by
radically neutralising and removing their causes,
thus allowing nature herself to do her work unim-
peded.
We now simply repeat that the new treatment
acts so radically and fundamentally upon the vital
circulation, without the least danger to the most
delicate constitution, that there is not a form of
disease that flesh is heir to which will not be
affected favourably to the patient by an intelligent
use of this method of treatment.
In selling this pamphlet we are obliged to require
a “ Pledge of Honour” from those purchasing it
not to show or reveal its contents outside of their
own families. This is for our own protection, and
as the only means by which our just rights in this
discovery can be maintained. .Doctors, of course,
who purchase are not debarred from using the
treatment in their own practice, providing they do
not show tiie pamphlet or do not reveal the
rationale of the treatment.
Dr. Stevens, of Syracuse, N.Y., was the first
M.D. to whom we revealed the new treatment-
more than twenty years ago. In writing to a
friend, about a year ago, he gives the following :
... “Nearly twenty years ago, in this city,
Dr. A. Wilford Hall gave me privately a detailed
history of a hygienic treatment he had discovered
and adopted some twenty years before, and which
he had practised continuously upon himself up to
that time. The history included an account of
the failure of his health, the reasonings and con-
clusions which led him to adopt the treatment, his
rapid restoration to health, &c. From the time
of his first mention of it to me I have been
entirely satisfied that it has saved him from a
lingering consumption and death. I learn that he
has persistently continued the treatment to the
present time—forty years in all—and that his
present health and vigorous condition may right-
fully be compared to the ‘ bloom of youth,’ though
he is nearly seventy years of age. The tests I
have made of the treatment upon myself and in
ray practice in the twenty years past have con-
vinced me that great practical benefit will be
derived by members of the medical profession and
others from a careful study of the rationale of the
treatment as discovered by Dr. Hall, the details
of which he proposes to give in his forthcoming
book. A debt of gratitude will surely be due him
for whatever scientific advances he may be able to
unfoW in the line of assisting nature to ward off
disease, and in the restoration of health.—ll. F.
Stevens, M.D.”
Dr. Jesse Huestis, of Columbus, Ohio, referred
to in our personal statement in April Microcosm
as the second M.D. to whom the new treatment
was revealed, writes to a brother physician who
had inquired of him concerning the Pamphlet:—
“ You need have no doubt concerning the merits
of the new treatment. I consider Dr. Hall’s
statements as true in every particular. He lias in
ray opinion made the most valuable discovery of
this or any other age for the purpose of combating
diseased action in the human system, be the type
what it may. . •. . I consider the price merely
nominal when compared with the inestimable
value of the discovery. It is just as accessible to
everybody under his method of selling it, by first
requiring a pledge of honour, as would be a
doctor’s prescription, for which he might charge
the same price. In both cases the remedy is free
to all who are willing to pay for it. ... It is
without doubt the true secret of longevity', and is
as valuable to those in health as in sickness, pro-
moting sound sleep, perfect alimentation, freedom
from weariness under exertion, and a sure protec-
tion of the circulation from impurities.—J.
Huestis, M.D.”

will I use the treatment with any others except the

Mr. Hern, Dr. Hall's Agent.
Dear Sir. —I have been a sufferer for the last
thirty years from Bilk and Bilious Headaches,
and have tried almost everything, and obtained
no relief, all the doctors’ treatments having failed.
I began to think I should never be better. I was
advised to try Dr. Hall’s Hygienic Cure, and the
result is marvellous. Mine being a very serious
case, having suffered so long, I had to be very
careful. But now 1 feel twenty years younger
than when I commenced the treatment. I have
applied it three times a week for the first two
months, and twice a week since, and am now as
free from all signs of biliousness as though I had
never been troubled with it. It is with the
greatest gratitude I express my thankfulness for
the cure.—Yours truly, Joseph Harrison, nut
and bolt maker at Carlton Foundry, Leicester-
street, Melbourne.
Nicholson-street, Eootscray, 13th April, 1892.
Mr. J. Hern.— Dear Sir. —I am delighted to
give my testimony for what Dr. Hall’s No-Medi-
cine Treatment has done for my distressed body
during the last seven weeks. I have been a great
sufferer for the last eight years from Rheumatics
in all my nerves, Neuralgia and constant-recur-
ring serious Bilious Attacks, with most distress-
ing Headaches. During the last five years I had
lost the use of my arms, and was almost drawn
double with pain. I suffered constantly most tor-
turing agonies of pains all over my body; God
only knows my dreadful sufferings. I placed my-
self in the hands of eight doctors, and for four
months was under one of the best herbalists in
Melbourne. I had tried almost every remedy, and
taken bucketfuls of various drugs and patent
medicines. 1 took SeigeTs Syrup twice every day
for over a year, also 11 bottles of Warner s Safe
Cure, four large bottles of Clements’ Tonic, and
still I was getting seriously worse, and thought
my end very near; but for my loved ones I would
have been glad to have died. May God bless Mr.
Hobbs of this city for calling and telling me what
wonders Dr. Hall’s new cure had done for him in
a few days ! Seven weeks ago, when I procured
Dr. Hall’s Health Pamphlet from you, I was get-
ting rapidly worse, and had lost all hope of being
better. My husband and I were astonished at the
wonderful new discovery disclosed in the book. I
at once determined to give over everything else and
give it a fair trial. 1 have carefully carried out
the directions, which are easy and simple; and
now what it has done for mo is most marvellous.
I cannot find words to express all the praises it
deserves. From helplessness, seven weeks ago,
J am up at a quarter to six every morning doing
my household duties. lam really almost like a
new creature. I used to be kept awake night after
night with pain. Now my night’s rest is enjoy-
able. My biliousness, sick headache and neuralgia
have for ever gone ; the store people and neigh-
bours are amazed to see me out tripping about in
the morning and looking so well. 1 would not
give up the use of Dr. Hall’s treatment for all the
money in the world. My statement can be corro-
borated by several .storekeepers in Nieholson-street.

Mephan Ferguson, Esq., Engineer, Leicester-

Hall’s Agent, 5 Gertrude-street, Fitzroy. Dear
Mir, —While in America, about eight months ago,
I purchased one of Dr. Hall’s Health Pamphlets,
and as I had previously experienced attacks of
Giddiness, etc., I determined to put the treat-
ment into immediate and practical application. I
had no difficulty in applying it, and to say that I
was surprised at the truly wonderful results
following its adoption, would only be expressing
myself, mildly. In fact I was astounded. Since
then I have recommended all my friends to give
it a trial, and have had the satisfaction of seeing
several of them follow my advice, with the most
beneficial results in every case. lam still recom-
mending it to every sufferer I meet, and will con-
sider it my duty to do, until your Health Pamphlet
will be so widely known that it will be a crime to
be ill. You may depend on my doing all in my
power for the sakeof suffering humanity to spread
abroad your wonderful little work. There is no
beating about the bush with it ; it is plain, con-
cise, and can readily be understood and put into
practice by anyone. The first cost is the only one,
and that is indeed trifling considering its great
value. I still continue the treatment, and am
attaining a perfect state of health and vigour,
altogether unhoped for. My friends notice my
changed appearance, and I can truly say that
since I began your treatment I am a different
man.—Yours very truly, Mephan Ferguson.
Station-street, Moreland, Coburg, 28th March,
1892. Mr. J. Hern. Dear Sir, —I believe that I
would render a good service to poor, suffering
humanity by giving a true statement of what Dr.
Hall’s Hygienic treatment has done for me. I
have been a great sufferer for the last ten
years from Rheumatism and a complication
of other ailments. My sufferings have been
very fearful at times from the crown of
my head to the sole of my foot. On a sudden
cold change in the weather it would cause a great
lump to rise on each side of my head, and so
severe was the pain I could only move with
greatest care. I had suffered so much and so long,
and took so much iodine and potash, and bushels
of various kinds of drugs, enough to kill a horse,
until my system was fairly poisoned throughout.
I felt and looked old and miserable at forty-two,
and I felt sure that the beginning of the end had
commenced with me. My veins were knotted,
and I told my doctor that 1 felt paralysis setting
in on me, which it proved to be. At this critical
juncture, through a neighbour’s persuasion, who
had rapidly been cimed through Dr. Hall's treat-
ment of a serious attack of Influenza, I obtained
a Dr. Hall’s Pamphlet from you, and now, after
five months' use of the wonderful “no medicine”
cure, I feel like a young man at twenty. My
constitution has been renovated and brought into
first-class working order by my blood being made
pure. Life now is enjoyable. Words cannot
express all that ought to be said in favour of this
hygienic, health-restoring process, which, I am
sure, stands unrivalled in the world. If I had it
before I got ill it would have saved me from all
my suffering and a large amount of money. lam
perfectly sure of that. I have received enough
benefit from the time I have used it to assure you
that I would not take all the money in Australia
and be without it.—Very truly yours, T. A.
Thompson.
Victoria Foundry, 7,9, and 11 Victoria-street’
Carlton, Melbourne, 14th April, 1892. I was very
incredulous about your cure when I first heard
about it, but having been induced to try it, I now
gladly testify that I have derived much benefit
from its use, and have myself recommended it to
others, with equally good results to them. I
regard the amount I paid as money well laid out.
—Yours respectfully, William Phillips.
Gl4 Little Collins street, Melbourne.—Mr. J.
Hern. Dear Sir, —During the last nine years I
have suffered greatly from my liver (sometimes
seriously congested), bile, indigestion, headaches,
and the discharge of a lot of phlegm that gave me
great trouble to clear up. I have tried nearly all
the best remedies, and was under a supposed
clever specialist treatment of massage, combined
with homoeopathic medicines, for twelve months,
and was worse than when I commenced with it,
through my liver being so bad and taking so much
drugs. It has changed the colour of my skin to
nearly half black. I have been using Dr. Hall’s
remedy three times a week for the last four
months, and it has had a wonderful health-restor-
ing effect on me. I have not taken a drop of
medicine or drugs since I commenced it, and I
have not felt my liver since, and all my complaints
are gone. Life now lias a new experience. I con-
sider the pamphlet a priceless gem.—Yours truly,
N. Pristner.
Chancery-lane, Melbourne, March 20, 1892. —
Mr. Hern. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in
testifying to thesplendid results obtained by using
Dr. Hall’s remedy. I have found it a complete
success. I suffered all last year from chronic
nervous weakness, which so debilitated my liver
and kidneys that I was very greatly reduced. I
was under the care of a clever doctor, but imme-
diately I ceased the remedies the affliction ap-
peared again. I am better now in every way. My
digestion, which was bad, is improving daily ; my
kidney complaint is wonderfully better, and it has
cured me entirely of obstinate constipation of a
very bad form. The logic of the system is irre-
futable. lam highly recommending it to all my
friends. I am still using it, and have not the
slightest doubt that it will finally leave me in as
healthy a state as it is possible for me to attain
to. —C.R. [This gentleman objects to having his
name published, but it will be given to anyone
desiring it.]
Dr. James Rooertson, of Birmingham, England,
repeats his former endorsement as follows,
February 14: “Dear Dr. Hall,—lt will be but
justice to you and may save me answering many
private letters of inquiry if I now give you my
rather extensive 12 months’ experience of your
new treatment. As at first recognised, the general
idea is a brilliant one, physiologically sound, and
I now add —all criticism notwithstanding—so far
as I can see, it is thoroughly original. In practice,
when intelligently carried out, it meets directly
the immediate wants of a large majority of the
ailing and suffering public; it sharpens the
appetite, stimulates the liver, lightens the labour
of the kidneys, moves the bowels; by so doing it
to body and mind, chases away bilious melancholy
with its legion of neuralgia, spasms, and pains,
and comes altogether as ‘a boon and a blessing td
men.’ Personally I have benefited much by it,
and when I find a patient with sense to use if
thoroughly, I can dispense with medicine and
attend to hygiene, the true province of the doctor,
I cannot withhold my testimony in favour of what
1 know to be simple, natural, and good, a power-
ful defence to the healthy, and the best remedial
process I know of, even in cases of serious organic
disease. You may challenge the world, medical
or general, to name a process of such widely
applicable remedial power.—Faithfully yours,
James Robertson.
Rev. W. P. Hall (no relative of Dr. Hall), of
Point Peninsula, N.Y., writes; “Dr. Hal.
Dear Sir,--! have just answered a letter from
Utah Territory. A friend wished to know if my
testimonial was given correctly in the Microcosm.
1 answered yes ; that it was true to the letter, and
that my endorsement was nowhere nearly as strong
as I could now truthfully make it. 1 told him
that your treatment had cured me of rheumatism,
kidney disease, catarrh, and other complications
of disease, so that from crutches and helplessness,
I am now as well and free from disease as fifty
years ago. I have already received and answered
more than sixty letters from all parts of the
country, re-affirming the truth of my testimonial,
and I will gladly answer one hundred times sixty
if thereby I can induce sufferers to try your treat-
ment, as I declare before God my unfaltering con-
viction, both from my own experience and obser-
vation in numerous cases, that your discovery, if
properly used and persevered in, will cure any
form of curable illness that flesh is heir to. lam
ready now to proclaim to all men unreservedly
that your treatment, as set forth in your Health
Pamphlet, and without drugs of any kind, is the
healing balm for the afflicted that is capable of
supplying health to every suffering son and
daughter of Adam. Let me know how I can serve
you, and command me freely.—Your friend grate-
fully, W. P. Hall.”
ISO Rosslyn-street, West Melbourne, April 11.
1892, To Mr. J. Hern, Fitzroy. Dear Sir,—lt
gives me the greatest pleasure to give my testi-
mony to the wonderful curative power of Dr.
Wilford Hall’s hygienic treatment. During the
last seven years I have been a sufferer from indi-
gestion, and a complication of other diseases, but
during the last three years, and up to the day I
commenced to apply your hygienic treatment, my
suffering at times was very great, almost unbear-
able. Not being able to get sufficient sleep, I
became very depressed. I had consulted four
Melbourne doctors, whose remedies gave me no
lasting benefit, though I had taken a large quan-
tity of drugs and patent medicims. 1 have been
applying Dr. Hall’s new treatment a little over
two months. Indigestion is no trouble to me now ;
scarcely feel it; I can enjoy my food and sleep
soundly. I have increased 121 b. in weight. r i he
new cure has been a real God-send to me. It has
made life now enjoyable. My wife and I are
spreading the good news all we can.—Yours sin-
cerely, E. Reading.
A minister in Melbourne writes : —“ My father
and I are speaking to the afflicted wherever wego
of the merits of the treatment you represent, and
will continue to do so. . . . As for my poor
brother, poor fellow, would we had applied the
treatment to him three months ago ; I feel sure he
would have been living to-day.”
From the Rev. Samuel Knight, Prahran Wes-
leyan Parsonage. Dear Sir, —1 feel confident that
your Hygienic treatment would assist weak and
slow digestion, kidney derangement, impurity of
the blood, and that it would promote longevity.
In many cases I believe it would make life a new
experience. People who, fly to nostrums would be
saved from much mischief by indiscriminate use
of medicines.—l am, dear sir, yours truly, S.
Knight.
From T. W. Rashleigh, Manager, Spectator
Publishing Co. Ltd., Melbourne :
“Dear Sir, —I have used Dr. Hall’s remedy for
some months with beneficial effect. I have a’so
answered a great number of letters of inquiry
from friends, to all of whom I have been able,
without hesitation, to recommend the treatment
for almost any disease. This remedy is not a new
quack cure, but a genuine and simple thing that
must commend itself to the intelligence of every
person who uses it. It has accomplished wonders
for many of my acquaintances in this city.”
Charles Birch, of El Dorado Springs, Mo.,
writes 18th January, 1892 :
“Dear Dr. Hall, —I bought one of your Health
Pamphlets about two weeks ago, and have been
practising the Hygienic treatment daily since. 1
have doctored for years, and no doctor ever
helped me or could tell what ailed me, and I
myself did not know until this morning, when I
passed about one quarter of a pint of gall stones.
Notv, I would not take all I am worth and give up
the use of your treatment, for it has done me so
much good.— l remain, yours truly, Charles
Birch.”
And hundreds of others.
To Ladies.
Dr. Hall’s treatment has wrought wonders in
completely restoring to a perfect state of health
several well-known ladies that the best medical
skill in Victoria could not cure. Some of them
had old-standing and very serious complaints.
They are willing to give any ladies their persons!
testimony, or by letter, but they object to their
names being published. Names given on applica-
tion to the agent.
One of them writes, April 14, 1892: “Mrs.
Hern, Dear Madam, —I object to my name being
published, but you may refer any lady to me, and
I shall be glad to personally testify to the great
benefit I have derived from Dr. Hall’s treatment.
I also think that one personal testimony is worth
a thousand published ones.”
Rev. Mr. Berber's wife writes from Bonny Boon,
Victoria: —“ It is wonderful the relief the treat-
ment gives my husband. He finds great good
from it. He has much improved during the last
fortnight. We are thorough believers in it,”

Tales of the Early Days.
No. IX.— The Wearing of “the Shoes of
Death.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
DY PRICE WARUNO.
Convict Jones having induced (as already
related*) the boy transport, “ Kinchin ” Walker,
to steal for him from the store-tent of the timber-
gang at Birch’s Inlet, a quantity of salt, maize-
meal and other rations, felt that the least he could
do when Overseer Lemon (taking it into his head,
one day, to make a rough computation of the
stores in stock) detected the theft, was to take
upon himself the responsibility for the crime.
Not that Convict Jones did this from notions of
stript justice or because he was the lad’s tempter ;
not so. The reason was a less creditable one. He
was moved to take upon himself the Kinchin’s
punishment by the consideration that if the
Kinchin were flogged he would probably confess,
not merely to the crime, but also its object—a
“bolt.” Jones thought he himself was bound to
be flogged in any case, whether he owned up to
the theft or whether he did not, and if he
allowed the boy to be triced up, he would be run-
ning the risk of the exposure to the Overseer of
the plan for escape. And, therefore, he concluded
to take the flogging, so as to preserve from the
Overseer’s knowledge the proposal for the “ bolt ”
—and, by the same act, retain the good disposition
towards himself of the Kinchin. On this latter
point, you see, the ingenious Jones calculated
upon the Kinchin turning out to be a “ tender
morsel.”
“Now, Walker!” demanded Lemon, “there’s
a lot of stores missin’, an’ yer’ve been camp-
keeper, an’ I ’old yer ’sponsible for all th’ stuff.
Wot’s come of it ?”
As veracity does not flourish in an atmosphere of
fear, naturally Walker lied. “I—dunno, sir! - ’
he stammered, and began to whimper.
“But,” continued Lemon, “no one ever come
near the camp stores ’cept me an’ yer. Now, I
ain’t stolen them, an’ it’s on’y you fur it!”
This colloquy took place in the space between
the tents on one side of the narrow clearing
and the fern-strewn quarters—so, too courteously,
were termed the gunyahs of the convicts —on the
other. Ensconced in one of the latter, Convict
Jones heard the accusation and the denial; and
his brain worked quickly to the before-men-
tioned conclusion. He instantly took in the situa-
tion, and as speedily as he could ran out into the
clearing and confronted Lemon.
“ Th’lad speaks th’truth, O’erseer ! He don’t
know nothink ’bout it. I prigged th’ salt, an’ all
t’other stuff.”
The Overseer, surprised at this apparent mag-
nanimity, asked the self-accuser what he knew
about it, and when he stole the goods. Jones, a
brilliant liar, instantly rejoined, “Yer thort, Mr,
Lemon, ez ye’d fixed me up fur th’ night, t’other
night, by th’ gully, but yer see yer didn’t. Ez
soon ez I digged th’ grave I comes all th’ way
inter camp. Wot does I find ? W’y, th’
sodger asleep ! An’ so I gets inter th’ store-tent!
That’s wot I knows.”
“ Asleep ! the sentry asleep ! Sergeant, d’yer
’ear that?”
Sergeant Lockwood denied, the statement. It
was impossible it could have been so—asked what
was the use of believing a prisoner—swore his men
were never remiss upon guard—finally questioned
Jones,
“’Ow d’yer think ez I prigged th’stuff ?” the
scamp replied. “’E wor fast asleep a-front o’ th’
fire !”
Who was on duty that night? The Overseer
tried to find out, but the night when Jones as a
punishment was left to dig a grave and bury the
victim of a logging “ accident ” was a month back,
and no one could recollect the sentry of the time.
On outlying stations no orderly-book was kept.
“Who was the sentry, Jones?” at last de-
manded the sergeant; and Mr. Jones, having a
particular grudge against Private Stanley—
Stanley, Jones thought, was unnecessarily libei’al
of bayonet-pricks—with much show of compunc-
tion, but with considerable joy of heart, declared
that he, Stanley, was the culprit. Stanley denied
the allegation, as he could truthfully do, inasmuch
as Jones had not directly stolen the things, had
not visited the camp as he said, and, therefore,
had not seen the soldier asleep at his post. And
it was the soldier’s word against the convict’s.
The Sergeant and the Overseer confabbed.
Could they believe Jones as to the sentry’s mis-
deed ? Yes —surely! Jones would not wish to
bring punishment upon a “lobster” by a false
accusation, just when he had relieved a brother-
transport from an imputation? So they reasoned
and so they decided. They believed Jones, and
resolved to punish both that worthy and the
sentry.
At Newcastle in the early days Commandants
and other penal officers used to carry the triangles
about with them, but there was no occasion for
any like proceeding at Macquarie Harbour-suit-
able trees were convenient to every spot. Within
ten minutes of the sentence being pronounced, the
soldier was inflicting 50 lashes upon Mr. Jones,
and you can be sure that, boiling over with rage
as he was, Private Stanley could see no virtue in
mercy. In all Mr. Jones’ numerous and lengthy
experiences of flogging he was accustomed to
award the palm for severity to that inflicted by
the soldier he had falsely accused, and as the_ plan
of sentence provided that Mr. Jones should in his
turn flog Private Stanley, it was an additional
source of pain to the convict to reflect that through
his own rigorous chastisement he could not sustain
his hardly-won reputation among the Harbour
floggers of being a genuine artist with a “ cat.”
Nevertheless, Private Stanley wriggled and cried
a good deal. He could not quite see the humour
of the affair, and enjoyed no consolation from the
circumstance that his plight would have been
worse had he been the first punished. He, indeed,
seemed to feel his 25 more than Jones his 50.
Yet when the time came for the gang to “up
tools” and proceed to the logging, it was Jones
who was unable to walk—it was Jones who was
smitten with sudden weakness —and Jones who,
from languid prostration, burst out in fits of the
epileptic sort. The soldier did not —then—seem
half so affected as the transport.
Lemon was disconcerted. Even his practised
acquaintance with convict tricks (which dated
back to that trip of the coffin-ship Surprise when
the surgeon dropped some transports overboard
to see if they were dead or alive) did not warrant
him in pronouncing Jones’s attack a sham. The
froth on the mouth was there —the clenched, lip-
biting teeth—the distorted rigidity of the eye-
balls. He bent over the fellow, and sniffed at his
face. “ He’s real bad !” he then said to Sergeant
Lockwood. “ That froth ain’t soap ! ”
“ I ’udn’t trust him, Mr, Lemon,” cried the
Sergeant, “out o’ yer sight. ’E ’udn’t need th’
prayer for speedy recov’ry once yer back’s turned.
’E’ll recover wi’out prayer ! ”
It nearly always happened under the System
that the civil and military powers differed.
Authorities clashed and powers overlapped, and
the dignities of the one department were seldom
preserved without ignoring those of the other. It
was so in Sydney and Hobart Town; and the
little creatures in the outlying stations followed
the big ones of the capitals. Consequently, Ser-
geant Lockwood’s gibe at Overseer Lemon’s
judgment proved very helpful to Mr. Jones. It
confirmed Mr. Lemon in his own opinion. In a
tone he meant to be terribly cutting he responded:
“Yer ideas, sergeant, will be walued w’en they’re
axed for ! That man ain’t shammin’ Abram any
more’n Stanley, yonder, is !”
Judicious Mr. Lemon! But for that retort
Lockwood would have ordered Stanley to stop in
camp that day to get over his flogging—there was
really a regulation to that effect. Lemon’s words,
however, stung him into showing his contempt for
the Overseer’s perceptions.
“ That is just wot I ses to myself, Mr. Overseer.
’E’s shammin’ as ray man is ! Jest as much an’
no more. An’ Stanley is shammin’.” Then to the
private, who was lying on the ferns just inside
the soldiers’ tent, he spoke with all the brutality
of the little pipeclayed god :
“Stanley, ’ttention ! Turnout in guard order
at once!”
“Oh, Sergeant Lockwood ” groaned the
poor, lacerated fellow, whose first chastisement it
was.
“On guard, Private Stanley, instantly, or I’ll
place you under arrest!” And the man, helped
by a comrade, struggled to his feet. It was some-
thing, let us tell you, to be an outpost of empire
in the early days ! And
“I’m waitin’, Overseer,” grimly exclaimed
Lockwood.
* # ®
Lemon, seldom anything but suspicious,
would no doubt have waited for a few minutes to
see whether Jones’ fit passed off but for the ser-
geant. The sergeant had a right to hurry him,
and Lemon felt that to change his own view of
the transport’s illness in a moment would, of
course, have been a confession that the non-com.
was right. That he would not do. But yet to
make sure of Mr. Jones, he in the same sentence
that he bade the other gangers prepare for the
day’s work, took, as he thought, ample precaution
for that gentleman’s safety.
“Up tools, pris’ners ! An’, Walker, bring th’
slaversf an’ a pair o’ darbies out o’ my tent. I’ll
make sure o’ th’ cove, ill or well! ”
And when the boy brought the fetters and the
handcuffs, he himself put both sets of irons on the
writhing, convulsed form with a newly-scored
back.
An official who had been trained under the
ship’s surgeon who thought the surest way of
ascertaining whether a man was really dead or
only in the stupor induced by long confinement in
an un ventilated hovel, was to drop him into a
shark-infested sea, may—possibly ! —be excused
from ironing a creature he believed he had just
scourged ipto an epileptic fit. The System, ab
least, would have excused him.
» * •
Anybody but Convict Jones —when “he
came to ” would have felt hurt. But Jones was
simply philosophical.
Twenty minutes must have elapsed before he
thought it safe to open a clear and undimraed eye
upon the scene, and even then he dared not raise
his voice above a whisper in addressing Kinchin
Walker, who stood a few feet off, anxiously
watching him.
“ Oh—w’ere —am I ?” he murmured, painfully.
“ Are yer better, Mister Jones ? My, yer’ve ’ad a
bad go ! Th’ Overseer didn’t know wot to make
o’ yer !”
“Anybody ’bout ; Kinchy?” whispered the
scamp.
“No—everyone’s gone. An’Lemon ses yer was
to ’ave nothink but water all day !”
Jones then —to the Kinchin’s sudden shock —
sat up easily, without the least effort, without
pain, save a little on the back.
“ Did ’e, now? Well, that’s kind ! But there’s
two ter ’av somethink ter say ’bout that.”
“ Are yer better !”
Jones looked quizzically at the lad. “Kinchy,
my son, s’pose ez I took in Lemon, ’twar no
wonder yer war bitten. Now, yer see, sonny, ’ol
Locky war right, arter all. ”
“Lor! d’yer mean it, Mister Jones? Was yer
on’y shammin’ ?”
“ O’ course!”
“ But Lemon ses th’ froth warn’t soap !”
“ Kinchy !” He spoke with the impressive
earnestness of a professor of the moralities to a
class of clean-souled youths. “Kinchy! Th’lag
wot kint take in Lemon deserves to be a lag fur
th’ terra o’ his nateral life ! ’E war right—’twarn’t
soap, but—well, never min’ wot ’twar. ’Tis a
little idea o’ my own ! ”
“ O tell me, Mister Jones—tell me,” enthusiasti-
cally cried this promising student of gallows lore.
“ No, sonny ! Th’ knowledge ain’t for nice boys
like yer! ”
“ O do, Mister Jones —I won’t peach to no one 1
An’ it may do me a sight o’ good some time.”
“Well, by-and-bye, sonny ! Not now—time’s
too preshus. ‘ 01’ Time’s a-flyin’,’ as th’ song ses
—an’ yer an’ I’ve got much ter do ! ”
“ W’y, wot d’y mean, Mister Jones? ”
“ On’y this— that ter day's th ’ day ! ”
“ Mister Jones ! ’’ The lad clasped his hands.
“D’ye mean as we’re to bolt ter day ? ”
“ Yer’ve ’it it on th’ ’ead ! That’s wot I mean.
An’ that’s wot I meant w’en I ses as there was two
ter see ’bout my ’avin’ water an’ nothink but
water ter day. Kinchy, drag out ol’ Lemon’s
tool-chest ! ”
In the official tent was kept the camp tool-chest.
This Walker managed to drag into the open, and
Jones by sidelong motions forced himself along
the ground towards it. He looked round for a
weapon to burst the lock, but failed to see any-
thing. “Fetch er stone, Kinchy—a big’un, an’
look sharp— ‘01’ Time’s a-flyin’.’”
The lad obeyed. His own fears were swallowed
in his admiration for his precious tutor. He
brought a large stone.
“ Kin yer ’elp me up, lad ?” And with strenuous
exertion —for what with his manacles and fetters
and wounded back, Jones, notwithstanding his
mighty will, was almost powerless to help himself
—the convict stood once more erect.
“Kinchy—that box ez got ter go on its back.
Kin yer git it over ?” The boy could not turn it
over so as to bring the lock uppermost. If it had

of her equipment was slavers’ “ bar-fetters’’-iron-bars

to be done, .Tones would have to do it himself,
And with an exertion so forceful that for several
minutes afterwards his body throbbed with great
tremblings, he did it.
“ Give me th’ stone.!” he groaned, as he brushed
from his brow the beads of sweat. He was
obliged to groan at last—and on the manacles a
drop of perspiration blistered into rust.
Kinchy Walker placed the huge piece of sand-
stone in his hands. He raised it up with such free-
dom as the impeded wrist action permitted—
swung it once or twice, the great muscles
protruding with the effort—then dashed it on the
upturned side of the chest. The wood splintered
but the tumblers of the lock held. Again was the
fragment of rook raised, again it descended ; still
again, and then the sockets gave. The lad, gasping
in admiration, could now wrench the lid open.
“ Wot’ll I give yer, Mister Jones?” he breathed,
“ Th files ! ”
The lad turned out the contents and withdrew a
rasp and a small file.
“ No,” said Jones, “give me a co’l chisel. It’ll
go through tli’ slavers quicker ’n th’
And the boy handed him one, and then the smith’s
iron-riveting hammer. The bracelets were easily
managed, and then, against one of the bazils, the
elder convict placed the edge of the chisel.
“ Hit away, Kinchy—all yer might! ”
“ But—Mister Jones, won’t it hurt badly ? ”
“Hurt. Good God! Don’t everythink hurt in
this ’ere damned ’ole ? Ain’t it all a question wot
hurts th’ littl’st ? Drive ’way, I say ! ”
The boy struck with all his force. The grim
features of the man stiffened with the pain, but
still he badetheboy go on. The only fear he had was
that the ankle-bone would be broken. Half-way
through, he told the lad to change the chisel to
the other leg. The inch-thick basil of that ankle
was also cut to half its diameter. Then he had
the Kinchin use the rasp on the uncut half, while he
himself used the smaller files on the other bazil.
In an hour he was free of the slavers.
Though with a poignancy in every pore, he,
with the assistance of the youth’s arm, raised him-
self to an erect position. Drawing himself ecsta-
tioally to his full height, he threw his hands, with
their red-ringed wrists, skywards. ■
“I’m free, now!” he shouted. “Free—free!
An’ never’ll them things, or trump’ters, or clinks,
be put on me agen wi’out some ’Stablishment
orf’cer a-bitin’ o’ th’ dust, an’ goin’ ter t’other
hell !”
At this blasphemy against the System, the boy,
affrighted, looked around. Surely so daring a
defiance would hurry Lemon and Lockwood on
the wings of retaliation? But those far from
lustreless satellites of the Powers that Were were
five miles distant: the former comfortable m the
reflection that Jones was safe m the embrace of
* *
Jones, once freed, put strenuously down
the murmurings of wounded Nature within him.
He would not admit that he was weak and full of
pain : that his back, with its weals of puffed
flesh, was an acute torture. The man’s indomi-
table will was determined not to confess, even to
himself, that there was any particular in which
the System was now his master. “Kinchy,” he
said, “yer’ll ’av ter prig some more salt fur mv
back. Rub it in well!” And the boy, wondering
but admiring, obeyed. With great spasmodic
wincings, instantly suppressed, Jones endured.
Then, with methodical haste, he ransacked the
tool-chest and the tent. Article after article was
taken up and put aside for use till some other
thing, equally useful but more portable, was dis-
covered. He bade the lad put on some of the
Overseer’s underclothing. “ Yer’ll want it, sonny,
w’en we get on th’ mountings.”
For himself, his chief concern was—boots, a
couple of tins of potted soup (a private delicacy
of the sergeant’s) a pound of tobacco—and more
boots. That is, after he had secreted two small
files and a packing-needle and twine.
“ W’y are yer so anxious about boots, Mister
Jones?” the lad asked, as Jones tied together the
two spare pairs of the two officers.
His mentor looked curiously at him: “Kin’t
yer emess, sonny ?”
“No!”
“ ’Cos, my lad, s'oosin’ —no, ’tain’t no s’posin’
at all— w’en we get ter th’ settlements, we may
get clos’, we may get hats, but we kin’t get boots
nor shoes. An’ ’tis that we’ve most reason ter be
afeard of.”
“W’y?”
“ ’Cos th’ walkin’ cuts th’ feet. Th’ perlice an’
th’ muster-masters kin alius tell a ’Arbour bolter.
Yer kin walk up an’ down th’ ’ol’col’ny fur a year,
an’ yer feet be’nt cut up like they be on th’ west
ranges, fur th’ sandstone gets inter th’ cuts, an’
th’ perlice they pick bits out, an’ it’s all up.
‘’Arbour bolter,’ they’ll say ter th’beak. ‘This
is western-stone, yer wushup ! ’ An’ they ’av yer.
Forth’soles never get better in this part o’ th’
country, w’ere 'tis tramp, tramp, tramp on ridges
or gully-stones alius. No, sonny, yer on’y ’av
yer treble fur nothink w’en yer kint land among
the settlements wi’ ’ol skin on yer feet.”
“But,” the lad whimpered, “ Wot’ll Ido? I
ain’t got no spare boots, an’ yer an’ Tooth an’
Burt ’ll take ’em if there were.”
For a moment Jones was silent. Perhaps in
that instant there was a contest between the
shreds of his better nature and the beast and devil
in him. The lad had tended him in bis fashion —
admired him —worshipped him as his protector
against the malign powers of the darkness and the
System. Would it not be better, after all, to leave
him behind? Life and hope was possible to the
youngster while at the Harbour, but if he joined
the absconders, death for him was certain. But,
if the battle did rage, the victory was not with
the good.
“ W’en yer shoes give out, Kinchy—we’ll—we’ll
carry yer ’mong us.”
There was a curious vibration in his voice, and
Kinchin mistook it for a sign of sympathy. It
was but the wretch’s sardonic appreciation of his
own double-entendre. “ Yes, we’ll carry yer,
Kinchy, lad !”
* * «
The day was wearing on to noon, when,
after a hearty meal and with the spoils of the
official stores, Jones and the Kinchin left the
camp. “Look yer last on pretty Sarah Birch,+
Kinchy ! All goin’ well, th’ Island ’ll know us no
more.” The lad, elate, grimaced coarsely towards
where in a humid haze glimmered the grey build-
ings on the sombre rock. He understood only the
surface meaning of the words.
By devious tracks, the paths of old logging
paities now largely overgrown by a species of
supple-jack, the two convicts passed from the
camp northwards for some miles, till the track
they were on ended in a water-course, which,
further on, became a tributary o: the Franklin.
Into this shallow streamlet Jones having first
hidden their stores in a ferny hollow with the
whereabouts of which on a former logging
occasion he had become acquainted, plunged,
and bade the Kinchin follow. This was done
to break the tracks. The boy would have
pulled his shoes off, but Jones told him that
an hour’s walk over the flinty pebbles would cut
his feet about so badly that when he got to the
settled country “ he’d be guve away at wuust.
’Av yer furgotten wot I tol’ yer orlready ? ” he con-
tinued, and he spoke with such a wounded irrita-
bility that Kinchin felt sorry he had been so
thoughtless as to urge his temporary inconvenience
against the instructions of his friend and teacher.
After all, it was possible for a lad to have the
vicious propensities of a man of 40, and to retain
something of the unsuspectingness of a child.
One hour’s walking on the bed of the shallow
stream, and then Jones mounted the bank again.
“We are ter cut ter th’ pits, Kinchy, ter bring
’way ail wot I’ve stored there. ’Tis ’ard work, my
boy, an’ yer’d better stay here.”
“No, no ! ” exclaimed Walker, quivering at the
bare thought of being left alone in the stifling
solitude. “Mister Jones, I’ll do anything rather
than stop here, sir. I’m so afeard o’ th’ dark.”
“ But it’s fearful work truly, sonny. It’ll take
me to cut my way ter th’ place.”
“ I’ll die, Mister Jones, to be left here,” the lad
persisted. And so it was decided that he should
go.
That passage through the forest was a foretaste
of the horrors and sufferings that were to be. Had
the lad to encounter them in company with a less
elastic or less hardy spirit than Jones, he would
assuredly have either succumbed in sheer terror,
or dragged himself back as best he could to the
camp. Now knee-deep in treacherous slime, now
traversing treeless sandstone gullies with hands
that were gashed as they clasped projecting
stones, and now breasting down the constric-
tor-like grasp of the vines, every foot’s progress
was a battle, every yard’s advance was a victory.
After three hours the early forest night
descended upon them. But while the biting of his
back increased with the frostiness of the night-air,
and his face grew haggard, Jones was drunk with
the delicious wine of freedom. And with merry
words and pleasant mimicry of Lemon and Lock-
wood’s likely manner when they reached camp
that evening, he strove valiantly to encourage his
young, almost swooning companion.
At last they halted. Through the ranged pines in
front of them was cleared a wider passage than any
they had yet met with, and Jones, peering through
the leafy veil had no hesitation in recognising the
spot. It was the place of his quest. He groped
about in the shadows, and then drew the lad to
his side. “See that mound, Kinchy?” “Yes,
sir,” he replied weariedly. But the weariness
vanished as soon as the elder told him that was
their resting-place for the night.
“We’re safer ’ere, sonny, ’n twenty mile away.
They’ll never think o’ lookin’ fur us on their back
tracks !” Then he made the lad gather ferns and
pine branches for their couches, while he got ready
their food. During the meal, with jests and sallies,
he kept the lad’s spirits up to laughter point, for
it was not his object to overtask or weary the
Kinchin at the first stage of their journey, and, as
soon as he could, he sent him to his bed of greenery,
and betook himself to his own. But, when the
lad had fallen into the deep sleep of exhaustion,
he, still borne up by his unconquerable determina-
tion, rose noiselessly and left the spot.
* e #
A hundred yards distant were the deserted
tan-pits—arelieof the first Commandant’s industrial-
experiment. During the hours of that night a
mouth back, when he said he had been engaged in
looting the store-tent, he had really been occupied
in clearing the pits of their rubbish, and in re-
filling them with grim and ghastly substances.
The body of the prisoner supposed to be buried
under the mound was in one pit swallowed in
brine, and divided into such fragments as the
scoundrel Jones considered likely to prove edible
in bis march. And in the other was his—skin.
To this last he had added, at a subsequent time,
the skin of one Bradford, a drowned convict,
whose corpse had been washed ashore. The epi-
derras were sunk in the tannic preparation. Dried
in the sunshine and exposed to the outer air, the
skin (in pieces) would prove a passable substitute
for leather.
Jones found the pits as he had left them, and
as he drew out the contents of one, and then
those of the other, he chuckled as he reflected
that he was handling the instruments with which
he was to gain his freedom. Although the hour
might well have excused even in his indurated
nature superstitious tremblings and nervous
shrinkings from his task, he thought as little of an
offended heaven as he did of the abominable
character of the actions in which he violated the
commonest instincts of human nature. For God
or Man, this genius|of the System had no tittle of
fear ; and, as for the Dark Gentleman —well, he
was Jones’ very good friend.
Through the night he toiled at the work of
removing the— food—and the—leather —to the
shelter of a piney hollow, and then he snatched
brief intervals of sleep, waking suddenly but
calmly as though the actualities of life had linked
themselves to his dream in natural sequence. In
the instant of his waking he stretched forth a
hand and covered the Kinchin’s mouth, shaking
him the while. “Kinohy, hark!” he whispered.
“ Kinchy!”
There was no carol of birds to hail the Mac-
quarie Harbour day ; but there were sounds
approaching that stirred the stillness not un-
musically. They were the beat of tramping feet
and the jingle of soldiers’ accoutrements.
“ Oh, Mister Jones !” the lad gasped.
“Hush, yer fool ! Don’t yer see they’re not
a-huntin’ us ? They’re goin’ ter work ter day.”
“ But they’re cornin’ here !”
“No, they pass us by. Be quiet ez a stiff,
now !”
The feet drew near, the regularity of the tramp
slipped into a rustle and scrape as the gully was
descended and ascended, there wrs a drawing of
deep breaths as the gang rested for a second before
resuming their tramp, and then a succession of
short, sharp coughs.
Kinchy, his eyes fixed with terror on Jones’
face, saw to his joy, a half-smile disturb its grim
hardness. The lad would have spoken, but dared
not whisper. Only five yards’ thickness of scrub,
which separated them from the gang, and even a
whisper might have carried. And not till long
after silence regrasped the spot did even Jones
murmur a word.
“ Did yer ’ear ’em cough, Kinchy ? ”
“ I heard three or four coughing.”
“ That war Bunt an’ Toothy, sonny. They saw
it, an’ll be here ter night.”
“ Wot is it, Mister Jones, an’ wot d’you mean ?
How can they be ’ere ? ”
“ I broke a saplin’ top, yesternight, Kinchy,
an’ Bunt an’ Tooth saw it, an’ coughed back.
They knew I war ’bout.”
“ O, Mister Jones —mightn’t they split? ”
“ Split—split! Me an’ them ’av sworn the oath
i —yer too young yet, Kinchy, ter take it, but yer

the lady's name.

It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Co.’s Cascade,
80 and 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is
iust the place; it is certainly the largest and best-
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there, so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

We have selected two or

to their children in the emergencies

because they come from good, sub-

what so many families lack —a med-

mother can administer with con-
fidence to the little ones in their
most critical hours, safe and sure
that it will carry them through
Croup.

know th’ oath is death ter them as take, an’ split.
An’ ’sides, I kin get ’em ’way from the ’arbor if
anyone kin. An’ wi’out me, they’re lost. An
now let’s ’av breakfast, sonny.”
“ Are we safe, so close?”
“Safe!” The rascal laughed. “Oh, Lemon
’ll work everybody double ter-day, he’ll be so mad
after losin’ o’ me an’ yer. We’re safer ’n if he’d
been huntin’.”
The lad set about mixing oatmeal and water —
this, sugar-sweetened, was to be his savoury meal.
He stirred the mess fora minute, and then, gazing
trustfully into the elder man’s face, said, “I do
wish, Mister Jones, as we was goin’ by ourselves.
I don’t like Bunt nor Tooth.”
Jones was cutting off a piece of tobacco, which
precious luxury was to be his breakfast —“ baccy ”
was necessary and luxury and all to such a
wretch ; but, though his mouth was watering for
the only morsel for which he then craved, he
paused to soothe the young fellow’s mind.
“Now, Kinchy, don’t yer cherish prejudices.
Prejudices ez bad. They’re not bad coves, ain’t
Toothy an’ Bunt, an’, look ’ere, Kinchy ” ho
paused. The boy waited eagerly, there was such
a tone of sympathetic confidence in the rascal’s
voice.
“Look ’ere—l mean for Bunt an’ Toothy ter
carry yer, lad, w’en yer boots get done. I’ll ’av
miff ter do ter carry— th’—th’ grub, yer see.”
“Oh, Mister Jones —yer are kin’ ter think o’
me like that.” The lad could have kissed his
mentor in his gratitude.
How could he know that Mr. Jones was men-
tally cursing himself for his carelessness ? He had
only stopped himself just in time from saying
“ the other grub.” And that remark might have
put even so simple-minded a lump as the destined
“tender morsel” on his guard. It was a narrow
escape, Jones thought, for himself, and Bunt and
Tooth. Food would be short enough as it was.
# * *
Food was short a month later. And the
promised land of the settlements was still a month
(if they were lucky) or two (if they were not)
ahead.
They were encamped in a gully of what is now
known as the King William Range. Between
them and the settled country lay granite and
sandstone mountains, quagmirish morasses, forests
as yet untrodden by foot of man. The native
tiger and the devil were the tenants of this
region. They thrived because, as yet, man was
not. Only the convict.
Bunt and Tooth were of the party. By one of
those pieces of strategy of which the convict mind
was so fertile, they had, the day following the
flight of Jones and the boy, induced Overseer
Lemon to send them to a spot a few score yards
distant from the main body of loggers.
A soldier went with them, the unfortunate
Stanley. One pine was felled, and then they
moved a little further away, and half-cut through
another trunk. Then the whistle recalled them to
the mid-day rest of haif-an-hour's space. _
The meal ended, they returned to their work,
their movements being aided by the point of
Stanley’s bayonet. Swinging their axes vigor-
ously, they had momentarily disarmed the
soldier’s suspicions, and he had come carelessly, in
the path of Ins “ walk,” within the reach of their
tools. A flash of thought passed from eye to eye,
the transports wheeled simultaneously, and blade
met blade in the sentry’s head. He went, with-
out a groan, to report himself in another world—a
paltry unit of some dozens of poor devils who
similarly died on guard. The three-and-a-ha f
hour’s lapse before nightfall enabled the murderers
to make a circuit towards the gully. Nor were
they pursued, for Lemon, with his weakened staff,
dare not send out searchers. After all, it was
only a “codger” that was left uncoffined ; and his
experience was not exceptional. One Overseer
Francis had taken a logging-gang to_ the Gordon
River, of six soldiers and 14 convicts. ihree
soldiers and two transports returned.
Now Bunt and Tooth, pleased to beof the party,
had been as solicitous of Kinchin Walker’s welfare
in the early stages of the march as Jones himself.
But when they had left the Deception Ranges
behind them and were penetrating what we
now know as Calders Pass in the hope of
striking the flat, marshy country between the
Great Lake and Lake Echo through which their
path lav towards the midland settlements, they
grew petulant with him. The purloined stores
had long been exhausted, and the fast diminishing
stock of other “ food ” suggested anxiety as to the
future. The larder was tolerably well preserved,
but when demands upon it would cease in the one
and same instant that they replenished the supply,
why defer the replenishment ?
So, one morning, when the Kinchy had been
sent out of hearing, they, very respectfully, as
befitted the fine qualities of Jones’ leadership,
petitioned him to bring matters to a, conclusion,
if not for them, for the Kinchin. They insisted
upon it being put to the lot.
Jones demurred, urged they should wait a little
longer, accepted their refusal with perfect
equanimity, and consented to put the question to
the lot. With the pleasant sense of humour
which was one of Ids characteristics, he then
suggested making the lad the judge in Ids own
cause. .
“Kinchy,” he said, quietly. “Toothy an me
’s ’ad a dispute. Pick up some leetle stones, will
yer?” The lad obeyed.
“Now, it’s odd or evens, Toothy. If th’
Kinchy ’olds out odd as yerses right, then you’ve
yer way. If t’other, I’ve mine.”
“ Wot’s it about, Mister Jones? ” asked the lad.
“ Mayn’t I know ? ”
“ Well yes, sonny. Yer see them boots o’
yourn’s gettin’ bad in the sole, an’ tis ter decide
w’ether we carry yer or not.”
The lad, gratified by this fresh proof of Jones’
care for him—for he did not doubt that Jones was
desirous he should be carried—smiled, put his
hands behind his back, fumbled with the pebbles,
thrust forth his closed right-fist.
“Wot is it, Mister Tooth ?” he questioned.
“ Odds !” cried Tooth. And odds it was. The
lad’s fingers opened and disclosed the three
stones.
“Yer turn, Jones!” said Tooth, “ter see as
who carries the lad.”
Again the doomed boy, innocent still of any
suspicion, played behind his back with the
pebbles.
“Evuns!” exclaimed the arch scoundrel.
“ Evuns !” But again it was odds ! One stone
wai seen on the outstretched palm.
“ Yer’ve ter do it!” shouted Bunt and Tooth
together.
And Jones nonchalantly nodded.
* * *
He passed towards where their bundles
lay, stooped over them for a few minutes, ex-
tracted something, and returned towards the
group. ,
“Kinchy,” he said, with never a thrill in a
syllable, “yer’ve ter be carried. Get ready !”
“How, 'Mister Jones? Wot d’yer mean by
gettin’ ready?” The lad, still unsuspectingly,
looked fearlessly into the murderer’s face.
“ Yer’vo to be carried dead, Kinchy !’
“O, God ! D’yer mean it, Mister Jones ? Ihe
lad was livid and choking ; the sudden revelation
of his fate, now too clear, dammed back the courses
of his blood and his speech,
“ D’ I mean it!” The whole brute came up
now in Jones, “ Yer alius axing that, as ef yer
doubted my word. Ido mean it!”
“ God ! An’ I—helped yer—to get free, Mister
Jones!” , ,
“ Get ready. If yer ’av any knowledge o- God,
an’ as yer called on Him p’r’aps yer ’av, say yer
prayers!” I r
The lad looked at Tooth and Bunt. He saw
nothing but implacable doom on the latter s
features. There was a twitching of Tooth s bps.
It may have been the symptom of sympathy
for the victim ; or, again, it may have been the
corning joy that had touched them into softness.
But the lad saw only hardness. And knelt.
No clergyman to this time had visited the Har-
bour, The System, however, was a handmaid to
religion. She gave her children prayers week y
with the Regulations. But the lad could only
remember the “ Grace before Meat,' because of
its more frequent repetition.
He tried in his terror to pray.
“ Our Father ’’—prompted Bunt.
“ p ol — wo t we’re ’bout to receive . His head
fell forward before he could whisper the conclusion
which would have been so terribly ironic in that
fatal moment. A swoon, merciful to the lad,,
made Jones’ fell deed the easier.
Yet, in all truth, the lad should have, been
thankful for that knife blow. Better death than
the System.

You’ll Triumph Not in This Land.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
You who speculate in Labour—whether land or
mines your spoil—
You who gamble with the harvests of the children
of the soil!
We impeach you as embezzlers —we —the Southern
sons of toil.
In the peace of long possession you are blind and
you are bold,
You have fortified tire mountains, and your guns
are manifold ;
But you’ll triumph not in this land as you
triumphed in the old !
Go and boast of “our resources,” but the land
shall not progress
In the poverty of labour and the wealth of idle-
ness !
Even tho’ the nations pass us while we struggle
for redress.
Shear us while you can in comfort—not for long
you’ll rob and rest,
There are men of settled purpose in the regions of
the West,
Hearts of gold to be discovered when the proper
spring is press’d.
In the dim and hazy regions that are opposite the
morn
There’s the spirit of a nation ! —there’s the pat-
riotism, born
In the darkness of your blindness and the silence
of your scorn.
And the land-shark will not stop it with the
wealth at his command,
Nor his everlasting fences stretching out across
the land
(Driving farmers and selectors to the barren soil,
and sand).
You have conquered for a season, we are bought
and we are sold,
You have strength as yet to rule us, and your
selfish hearts are cold,
But you’ll triumph not in this land as you
triumph’d in the old.
Sydney, May, ’92.
HENRY LAWSON.
In Memoriam.
AN AUSTRALIAN POET.
Alas, that he whose vision hold so much—
Who pierced to where those dim-hid mysteries,
Locked in the heart of wild-wood shrubberies,
Throb out their secrets in low melodies
Ilis fine ear caught—should rob us, by that touch
Of hasty eagerness to grasp it all,
And leave us yearning vainly o’er his pall !
What chords untouched lie deadened in the clay !
Each unvoiced creek and gully mourns his loss ;
The tall trees bend their mourning heads across
With sighing whispers to the winds, who toss
The withered leaves in saddest disarray,
Till God send down a like so gifted tongue—
Till then—a silence—barren, void, unsung.

The secret of keeping young at the age of
seventy: Never do anything yourself which you

We have received from Messrs. Harrold
Bros, a sample of Hiram Walker and Sons’
(Walkerville, Ontario, Canada) Canadian Club
whisky—a mellow and pleasant-flavoured spirit of
the Bourbon order. In Canada there is a most
stringent law in force, preventing any spirit from
being sold until it has arrived at the age of two
years, and to ensure this the Government retains
it in its possession for that length of time after
manufacture—a precaution that is not taken by
any other Government in the world. Not only
has the consumer of whisky in Canada the
advantage of an enforced minimum age; he has
also this security—the benefit of which is shared
by the producer—that every bottle of whisky has
its age guaranteed by Government. Which, now
that Victorian brandy promises to gain a place at
the top of the European market, affords a valuable
hint to .the Australian Governments. The
enormous success which has attended the export-
ing of butter for Victoria under official inspection
should lead to further experiments in a similar
direction.

“There is a strong strain of brutality in
the Arab and his descendants,” remarks Sydney
Echo. “ The wars of that fierce race show it
over and over again.” So they do. These Arab
wars are not pleasant reading, and when we feel
sick of carnage we like to turn from them to the
refreshing page of the daily paper, and learn
about the man whose ear was chewed off, and the
lady who walloped her child to death, and the
baby-farmer who starved infants in a cellar, and
other glorious evidences of the advance of civilisa-
tion. The Arabs are a disgusting crowd.

My Poem.
I wrote a little ballad of the Bush,
A simple, touching tale I thought would please,
I brought in “mallee scrub” and the “soft rush
Of wind through silver gums and wattle-trees.”
I had a “swagman with his bluey,” too,
A “gunyah,” and “ a cool tobacco cloud,”
Some “dingoes ” and “ an old-man kangaroo,”
A “stockman”and a “squatter bad and proud,”
A “ dark lagoon ” still haunted by the dead,
A “dried-up creek,” and then “a nameless
grave,”
With “station children romping overhead.”
I took it to the editor and gave
It to him that he might peruse my lay,
And waited, confident of praise and pay ;
He read and raised his foot —no more I’ll say,
But that is why I don’t sit down to-day.
