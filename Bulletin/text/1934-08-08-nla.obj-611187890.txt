To meet the growing demand for a
bus to carry average size loads,
swiftly, safely, comfortably and
economically, Reo has developed this
new chassis—a small bus with big bus
characteristics. The Model 2L is pow-
ered with the famous Reo Gold Crown
Engine—a power plant that gives
thousands of miles of dependable
performance at the lowest operating
cost. It has a sturdy double drop
frame giving low centre of gravity—
-4 wheel Hydraulic Brakes for maxi-
mum safety—Spoksteel wheels, the
safest type for bus operation—Cam
and Lever steering and many other
exclusive Reo features.
The Reo Model 2L is to-day's best
money maker. Its design makes pos-
sible more trips—less empty seats . . .
more revenue—at a lower investment.

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times ot
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

Queensland, as a market, is therefore
its 950,000 people, collected in fami-
lies throughout the State.
It would seem a difficult task to
find a common bond between all the
varied interests of these people
a market-place where mer-
chant ana client may meet.
Yet there is such a market place
. . there is a common bond be-
tween all the varied interests . . .
the daily newspaper.
Through It you can reach the fami-
lies ... the 950,000 people that
make up the Queensland market.
A market too, that has thrown off
the throes of depression and is now
well advanced along the road to
prosperity.
Deliver your advertising messages
into the homes of these people, and
you will find a ready response. Let
The Courier-Mail carry the story
of youi merchandise into more than
62,000 homes throughout Queens-
land
Make the columns of The Courier-
Mail the market-place of the
250,000 people who dwell in these
homes. . . . Make each family
circle a market-place.
No other Queensland newspaper—
Daily or Sunday—can deliver your
advertising messages into so many
homes . , . can offer you a mar-
ket of so many people . . . can
render such a service at so low a
cost.

HIS
BOOKS
Book-reviewer’s Choice
Among the trials of every reviewer
is the friend who wants to know
which of the latest books to read. It
no doubt explains the Book Guilds and
Book Societies which flourish in Eng-
land and the U.S.A., and which are
bound to appear here before long. About
75 per cent, of the works chosen by
these bodies are financial failures; so a
reviewer whose friends enjoy no more
than one out of four of his recommenda-
tions can claim to be doing fairly well.
Here are four widely different publica-
tions, each of which appealed in ways to
the writer. None is a Book of the Month,
yet any of them might have been on its
merits. One, at least, may be called a
work of art.
Crime
Whispering Tongues, by Laurence
Kirk (Heinemann ; 7s. 6d.), is a thriller,
but, like all good thrillers, it is primarily
a social study. The action takes place
in Brackenbury, the English village where
the murders occur, and the characters
are people who may be found in any
part of England. The most important
person in the neighborhood is Miss
Forster, of the Manor House. She and
her sister Dolly might have married if
there hadn’t been a shortage of suitors
sufficiently well-bred to enter their family,
and they suffer from the usual complexes.
A third sister married a social inferior
with disastrous consequences ; the hus-
band is being tried on a charge of hav-
ing poisoned her as the story begins. He
is acquitted, and the village is still
agitated by the scandal when Miss Dolly
is poisoned.
The suspense derives from the reader’s
knowledge that Sarah, the heroine, is
liable to go next. She is charming, and,
so is her young man. Her father, the
local doctor, and the young man’s
parents fan impoverished peer whose
wife was a Gaiety girl) are unusual with-
out being incredible, and the atmosphere
of terror is skilfully worked up towards
the end. Mr. Kirk has a Le Fanuesque
gift for getting macabre effects without
striving after them, and his people talk
naturally.
Comedy
Cheap jack (Heinemann; 7s. 6d.) is
said by the author, Phillip Allingham, to
be true. It describes the adventures of
a young man who couldn’t even get
through Responsions at Oxford, and who
failed in several businesses after he was
sent down. His assets are shamelessness
and the gift of the gab. At the moment
when ruin faces him his only presentable
clothes are a dress-suit and a top hat.
He puts them on and commences prac-
tice in the nearest pub as a clairvoyant.
In this get-up, which serves to distinguish
and advertise him, he works the fairs
of England and Wales, and gets to know
the ways of grafters, mug-fakers,
freaks, pitchers, gipsies and vagabonds
generally. He is attractive because he is
as free from pride as a baby.; and he
has a healthy baby's interest in new
things and readiness to make friends
with new people. fudged by normal
.standards he is a .moral and social im-
becile ; but one of his charms is that
he doesn’t consider himself abnormal.
After a while his people get him a job
in London. No more hardships, no
more scheming for money. With a sigh
of relief he prepares to settle down in
comfort —and goes off on his travels
again. Being what he is—perhaps the
only public school and university pro-
duct in the kingdom with the capacity
to feel at ease in broad daylight in a
battered dress-suit—he couldn’t have
done otherwise; but somehow his re-
lapse gives the reader the kind of jolt
it must have given his conventional rela-
tives. If George Borrow hadn’t made a
success of peddling Bibles he might have
done well as a grafter at fairs. The re-
semblance between Borrow’s tempera-
nient and that of
this restless, good-
hearted, impu-
dent and some-
t ijm e s truculent
adventurer is re-
markable.
Tragedy
Arnold Bennett devoted practically an
entire novel to an analysis of an elderly
man’s experiences while dying of pneu-
monia. Corporal Tune, by L. A. G.
Strong (Gollancz ; 7s. 6d.), analyses the
physical, but to a far greater extent the
spiritual, experiences of a young man
with an internal Complaint. Mr.
Strong hasn’t got Bennett’s piercing
eye for detail, or perhaps detail doesn’t
interest him. Though he may have
known the doctors and nurses, and even
have been through some of the experi-
ences he describes, he subordinates them
to a matter of greater significance—the
thoughts in the gentle mind of. Ignatius
Farrely. Life has dealt hardly with
Farrely, but he has a divine resilience,
and his disappointments and disillusion-
men ts always find him patiently ready
for more. The slow revelation of his
character is interesting, but even more
so is the revelation of its effects on those
who come in contact with him. By some
magic of the writer’s art disease and
death are robbed of their shameful
aspects and made to appear beautiful.
The last phase of the invalid’s life has
the still glamor of one of those airless
summer days in England which begin in
a glowing haze and shimmer gradually
into darkness.
Farce
Mon Repos (The Bodley Head ; 65.)
will be found a useful antidote to the
melancholy of Corporal Tune. Nicholas
Bevel was motor-biking when he dis-
covered a cottage containing a parlor or
salle-d-manger, den-kitchenette, bath-
room-boudoir and tower bedroom with
flagstaff. A small front garden, rustic
gale and goldfish pond or swimming-
pool added to its charms. In a surge of
juvenile ecstasy—for he was deliciously
young at the time—Nicholas bought it,
and made of it what he calls “the faery
castle of boyhood dreams.” >
The book depicts the life of a writer,
now approaching middle-age, who has
capitalised his youth, his artiness, and
his capacity for being more archly girl-
ish than any modern flapper. He is
Edwardian in his old-maidishness.
My boy-friends adore my wee home, but
girls are more difficile. 1 am really not
lond of girls . . . but hide this because
they sometimes buy my books.
Louis, a boy-friend, promises to stay, and
presently appears, “his patent boots with
light cloth uppers shining on the cinder
path.” They go to church together, but
Louis, as usual,/is overdressed.
I put on plus-fours as a lesson. They
are wide like skirts, and this induces a
gentler mood—all writers must have a
feminine side, although I shall never forgive
the reviewer who talked about my “girlish
laughter.”
There is a tiff when Nicholas makes
an exasperating discovery. Both know
a duchess. Mon Repos is dedicated
To
Her Grace
The Duchess of Lidorino
toujows dans 'man ccenr.
The book Louis is writing has the same
dedication, except that “pensee” is sub-
stituted for “cceur.”
So the joyous nonsense goes on and
on, and the humor is added to by some
exquisitely funny drawings.
Being first-class parody it is first-class
criticism. The snobberies and vulgari-
ties of Beverley Nichols are clearly-
stated, but his commercial cleverness is
stated too. He has a bigger public than
Marie Corelli had in her prime. Max
Beerbohm would have no cause to be
ashamed of the wit of Mon Repos, and
it is kindlier than most of his parodies.

NEW-PRINCIPLE REMEDY
RELIEVES SOUR STOMACH
AT ONCE
Be warned of after mealtime pains,
flatulence or heartburn —Nature’s sig-
nal of serious danger. Proof positive
is available to tell sufferers from the
misery of neglected indigestion that
they can, with this wonderful, entirely
new-principle remedy, start on the road
back to health. And how glorious it is
to eat what you like, as much as you
like, knowing that after mealtime pains
will worry you no more.
Here are a few from a host of letters
every indigestion sufferer should read.
Doctor Astonished.
Your powder acted like a charm on
my nervous dyspepsia. My Doctor says
he is astonished with my wonderful
improvement.—No. 74.
Acid Stomach Relieved.
The first dose of your Antacid Powder
relieved the acid and burninBT. I can now
sleep at night. I am very glad I tried
De Witt’s Antacid Powder. -N0.83.
Gastric Ulcers.
Some years ago, I had an operation
for gastric ulcers, but soon after was as
bad as ever. I suffered from agonising
wind day and night. De Witt’s Antacid
Powder freed me from awful pain, for
which I am grateful.—Nc. 127.
An Absolutely Different New
Remedy for Weak Digestions
The specially chosen ingredients of
this quick-action remedy are three-fold.
Firstly, the special colloidal-kaolin
content soothes and strengthens the
digestive organs. The ultra fineness of
the quality of this kaolin ensures the
absorption of poisonous bacteria in the
bowels, without hindering the working
of these organs in any way.
Secondly, an important ingredient
actually helps to digest your food,
thereby taking an enormous strain from
the weakened stomach and enabling
you to get the full nourishment from
your food.
Thirdly, this remedy builds up within
the body an alkaline resistance so that
acidity, that leads to burning, griping
pains and ulceration, is neutralised to
free you from such pain and danger as
gastritis, colitis or chronic bowel weak-
ness. Don’t suffer indigestion misery
longer. Go to your chemist now. Ask
for and see you get —

couldn’t be expected to stay in Aus-
tralia. London has been a magnet to our
artists in every medium for generations.
Latterly it has begun to look as if some
of the novelists, anyhow, were going to
prove exceptions to the rule. L. W.
Lower wrote “Here’s Luck,” a master-
piece of its cynical kind, and he is still
in Sydney, and reported to be at work
on another book. So is H. R. Williams,
whose “The Gallant Company” got a
column of applause in the Literary Sup-
plement of the “Times.” “Flesh in
Armor,” by Leonard Mann, a Mel-
bournite, deserved many of the com-
mendations which the “Times” bestowed
on “The Gallant Company.” For
example:
The author has managed by sticking to
reality to place on record the feelings and
reactions not of the highly sensitive but
of the average man.
And, of course, there is Brian Penton,
who shows no present signs of wanting
to emigrate.
F. E. Baume, author of Burnt Sugar
(Macquarie' Press ; 7s. 6d.), may now be
added to the list. His “Half Caste” was
a fine novel in spots ; Burnt Sugar is fine
all through. His gift—apart from the
capacity to write easy, vivid prose—con-
sists chiefly of a capacity to get inside
the hearts and minds of alien people.
In “Half Caste” he revealed Maoris;
here he reveals Italians and Italo-Aus-
tralians.
The Italian, who is perhaps the polit-
est and most charming national in
Europe, sometimes becomes boorish and
morose in Australia. Burnt Sugar ex-
plains why. Mario Zobella is forced by
his mother in the tropic canefields town
of his birth to remain Italian. Her death
releases him on the tide of the longed-
for Australian citizenship which he
achieves dramatically and prosperously
in Sydney. But the complexes which
she instilled into him prevail ; the good
sugar is burnt in the making. The
secondary characters are also of foreign
blood, but, while retaining the best of
their racial qualities and traditions, they
are established as happy, productive
Australians. The hero-gone-wrong re-
tains nothing and assimilates nothing of
real value.
The style is almost too zestful; here
is a novelist who probably enjoys the
physical act of putting words on paper
and who rarely revises a sentence. There
is an occasional defiant crudity of image,
and the climax is reached at a gallop,
but these are small things in a big work :
and Burnt Sugar is very big, in concep-
tion, in treatment, and in the massive de-
tachment with which the author looks
down on the racial, political and eco-
nomic rivalries and hatreds of his
creations.
Books of this kind, like the others men-
tioned above, have a national value. They
interpret facets of the forming Austra-
lian character which hitherto have been
seen dimly even by Australians, and
which, more frequently, have not been
seen at all. Long may their clear-sighted
and courageous authors stay here to
carry on the pioneer work.

Threats to Mars
Michael Foot, R. G. Freeman, Frank
Hardie and Keith Steel-Maitland, joint
authors of Young Oxford and War (Sel-
wyn and Blount; Robertson and
Mullens ; 75.), took a leading part in the
passing of the Oxford “King and Coun-
try” resolution.
Mr. Foot, who was president of the
Union last year, is a Liberal. He ascribes
the growth of pacifist sentiment at Oxford
to the spate of literature depicting the
horrors of the next war ; to a reaction
against the worsening of the world situa-
tion and to hatred of a form of educa-
tion which militates against international
unity in cultural and social aims. In
defence of his standpoint he quotes Scrip-
ture, and, in obedience to his Liberal
creed he contests the Socialist armiment
♦wTiu 1 tne socialist argument
that the sole cause of war is economic
competition.
Mr. Freeman is an ex-president of the
October Club and a Communist. He
uses the Marxist analysis to demonstrate
that war benefits nobody, and prophesies
the steady growth of revolutionary senti-
ment at the universities.
Mr. Hardie is a member of the Labor
party and a Socialist. He differs from
his Communist colleague, Mr. Freeman,
by deprecating the class war, and, after
an exhaustive discussion on methods of
elimination, concludes that all roads lead
back to Geneva.
Mr. Steel-Maitland is a enn nf th*. Pt
Hnn Sir Arfhllr L a
on. Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, M.P.,
anu a Conservative. He believes that
Pf* vat ® trade in armaments should be
abolished and the League of Nations re-
habilitated, though he is not very clear
as how these two desiderata can be
brought into the realm of practical
politics. In the last resort he pins his
faith to the genuine peace aims of the
British Empire, which is “not an aggres-
sive entity.”
The net impression gained from the
debate is that all four, though they dis-
agree fundamentally as to the causes of
war and the right methods for its aboli-
tion, are unitedly convinced that, when
the next war comes, they will brave the
contempt and hatred of their fellows and
refuse to fight in it.
I submit that, in general terms, it
means very little. What happened when
the last war broke out? Government
censors occupied cable and newspaper
offices. Armies and navies were mobilised
and could have suppressed any counter-
war movement. But such action was not
necessary, for most of the Socialists fell
over one another in their eagerness to
affirm their loyalty, even Wells. And
when Shaw raised a note of protest he
became the most unpopular man in Eng-
land.
Mass psychology was a potent thing
then, and it is just as potent now; and
Governments know better now how to
work upon it, owing to the examples of
Lenin, Mussolini and Hitler, not to men-
tion the researches of the Russian Pavlov
into the phenomena of conditioned
reflexes.
It might be asserted that things will be
different because we know what the last
war was like, and that the next will
be even more frightful. The answer is
that it will therefore arouse more fright-
ful fears and evoke more frightful re-
actions.
Moreover, pacifism is anti-biological.
It is contrary to man’s deepest instincts,
which are fiercely warlike. Nor would
we wish them otherwise. The instincts
even make war on one another.
Nations will not want to make war
when they learn how to live, and that in-
volves more fundamental problems than
are posited by the Socialism of Mr.
Hardie, the Liberalism of Mr. Foot, the
Communism of Mr. Freeman or the Con-
servatism of Mr. Steel-Maitland.
M. G. SKIPPER.
A Canadian Separatist
My Vision of Canada, by William
Arthur Deacon (Ontario Publishing
Company; $2.50), marshals the argu-
ments for an autonomous Canada outside
the British Empire. In order to justify
a break with England a moral case has
to be built up against her. It has been
done before by advocates of Home Rule,
Sinn Fein, Swaraj, and so on, but rarely
with such concentrated venom. The
main theme is England’s criminal selfish-
ness. She has never been the champion
of small or weak countries, only the
enemy of countries that threatened to
become serious rivals. England stood
by France and Belgium in 1914 because
Germany was getting too strong ; now
she is preparing to stand by the Ger-
manic nations against France as she did
when Napoleon became powerful.
The Balance of Power has worked. A
little country, and one naturally weak,
has kept its independence by playing the
ancient gambit without deviation for four
centuries. Canadians might as well under-
stand what the Balance of Power means,
since 52,000 of them died in France and
Belgium to prove the wisdom of Henry
VIII.’s plan for corporeal protection of
—England.
Freetrade wasn’t designed to give the
English masses cheap food ; the object
was to give English manufacturers cheap
labor and enable them to push their
wares, “which were really the blood and
tears of the laboring people, upon the
world markets, which often had no
option but to buy, thanks to a ruthless
naval power.” English Governments
have invaded, exploited and robbed on
behalf of the London banks in India,
Africa, Persia, Arabia, Mesopotamia
and elsewhere. A startling light is cast
on English activities in Australia:
In 1788 the English established them-
selves in Sydney and took possession of a
large part of Australia, where the Dutch
had begun sheep-raising on a large scale,
and were exporting wool in enormous
quantities.
There are many inaccuracies of the
sort; the book seems to have been
written in a tearing hurry. Yet it is
valuable as showing that some Canadians
anyhow resent Imperial ties.
Mr. Deacon is not pro-American; on
the contrary, he is rather more severe
on American than he is on British
methods of aggrandisement. The only
foreigners who appeal to him are
Chinese.
China is an ally to be wooed with every
device within our means. She is cul-
tured and honest. She has intellectual
gifts and moral stamina. She has mass
weight beyond that of any other nation.
Judging by the press notices on the dust-
jacket, the book has been well received
in Canada.
D.
A Satchel of Books
Marjorie Bowen has taken as the cen-
tral character for The Triumphant Beast
Giordano Bruno, the philosopher. We
are given glimpses of Sir Philip Sidney,
Henry IV. of France —eager to learn the
Black Art but incapable of appreciating
Bruno’s truth—Sixtus V. with his plans
for rebuilding Rome, and the mad Em-
peror Rudolf II.; but there is little at-
tempt to portray the life of the period,
the stage throughout being almost ex-
clusively held by Bruno. He drifts from
Court to Court and from patron to
patron, teaching his philosophy and writ-
ing his books ; never tolerated long in
one place, and always with the shadow
of the heresy-hunters closing in upon
him, until inevitably he “leans upon a
flame” in the Campo Fiorito in Rome.
No Longer Innocent, by E. W. Irwin
and Ivan Goff (Angus and Robertson ;
65.), is the saga of two young Westralian
reporters who left Perth to see the world
with £lOO between them, and brought
up eventually in M.L. with 11s. Their
story of semi-starvation and irresponsible
extravagance, of calm beauties and tropi-
cal hurricanes, of freezing on the tender
of a C.P.R. engine in the Rockies and
of burning deserts crossed on a 3000-mile
hitch-hike is highly diverting. They
stowed away at Suva, and no one sus-
pected the young man who played the
piano so soulfully or the steamy wraith
in the ladies’ bathroom who had had five
prolonged soaks in different bathrooms
when his constitution gave out.
The Cherbourg Mystery, by John
Maske (Rich and Cowan; Angus and
Robertson ; 7s. 6d.). The villain is a
Frenchman known as The Needle —small,
dapper, a terror with the ladies, and a
contriver of complicated plans for the
destruction of right-thinking Britons
which never come off. The footnotes
indicate that his infamies have been
dealt with in previous books by Mr.
Maske. In this one, after various
manoeuvres, he leaves several estimable
people in the dungeons of the Chateau
d’Orange, near Cherbourg, with gas
pouring through a hole in the floor, while
near by is Irma (who seems to have
spurned him in the past) awaiting death
by drowning. They all get away, but so
does The Needle, so we may expect to
hear of him again next publishing season.
Shallow Dive, by Geoffrey Williams
(Rich and Cowan; Robertson and
Mullens ; 7s. 6d.), will be found useful
by Australians who want to learn the
jargon of the very latest set of smart
London degenerates for purposes of imi-
tation. The whimsicalities and obsceni-
ties of the dialogue make “Design for
Living” seem old-fashioned. Most of
the characters are without character or
definite purpose, so that the reader is
only surprised when one of them reacts
to a given situation on normal lines.
There is a good deal of grim humor in
their cretinous goings-on and in the
tragedy with which novels in this genre
always end. The formula may be get-
ting somewhat stale, but this is certainly
a successful example of it.
The Scarlet Beast, by Francis Gerard
(Nicholson and Watson ; 7s. 6d.), is a
literary curiosity—an interpretation of
the Punic Wars in terms of the last great
war. Hannibal and his men are Huns,
and Carthage is another Berlin.
Drawn from distant lands but linked
in that brotherhood which has always
fought for decency and sanity in Europe
these men [of Scipio’s] were going, side
by side, to stamp flat something that was
foul, something that had no right to exist-
ence, something that was a very pestilence
in the face of the sun.
“Delenda est Carthago !”
The Romans make love like movie stars,
and Marcus, the hero, is as shocked as
an R.S.P.C.A. member at the sight of
a lion being tortured. Failing to get a
Blighty, Marcus tries to wangle a spot
of leave on the ground that his wife
needs him. Scipio turns him down in
terms that have a familiar ring to most
of us, however useless we were as
soldiers.
I’d give a good deal to be able to let
you go, Marcus, but I can’t spare you
yet . . . I need you here, Marcus, Rome
needs you here.
Some of the battle scenes are exciting,
but the general effect is as cloying in its
worked-up emotionalism as a 1917
recruiting speech.
An Atlas of Current Affairs, by J. F.
Horrabin (Gollancz ; Dymock’s ; 3s. 6d.).
A reference book of 159 pages, with
half that number of full-page maps and
a complete index. Every part of our
troubled world is dealt with, and several
of the events ( e.g., the Balkan Pact be-
tween Greece, Roumania, Yugoslavia
and Turkey) concern the early months
of this year. Germany and the Balkans
are naturally given most attention. For-
tunate Australasia only gets two passing
mentions, but the second is ominous:
There is little doubt that a new race in
armaments between the United States and
Tapan is beginning. In such a case Aus-
tralasia and the British Imperial Defence
Committee must inevitably be involved.

TWENTY YEARS AFTER.
This time 20 years ago the young man-
hood of the Commonwealth and Maori-
land was flocking to recruiting depots,
and the ships of the R.A.N. and the M.L.
squadron were assembling at their ap-
pointed stations. For the Empire was
at war with Germany (not yet with
Austria-Hungary, Turkey or Bulgaria),
and Australia had offered an expedi-
tionary force of 20,000 men, and Maori-
land one of 8000, together with the ser-
vices of their warships. Over in England
the grim soldier who, chancing to be in
London, had been called to the War
Office was beginning his preparations for
a three years’ struggle ; but nobody in
Australia looked so far ahead. Why should
anyone worry? Had not the enemy
already been stopped by “the gallant little
Belgians”? All the newspapers said so.
Among the recruits the prevalent fear
was that they would be too late for the
fighting.
They were licked into shape as thor-
oughly as time and the necessities of the
situation permitted. The Scharnhorst
and the Gneisenau were chased far away
into the Pacific ; German New Guinea
was captured by Australians; German
Samoa by Maorilanders. Troopships
gathered at every port, concentrated at
Albany and bore away the first of the
legions to storied lands in which they
and those which came after them
marched over roads trodden by the
armies of the Pharaohs and Cambyses
and Alexander ; of Caesar and Saladin ; of
Tamerlane and Napoleon. They fought
battles bloodier than Waterloo and
gained victories as brilliant as Blenheim.
And wherever they went they made a
name for unsurpassed valor and re-
sourcefulness in the lines and for true
manliness behind them.
In all 330,000 Australian and 93,000
Maoriland soldiers went overseas. Nearly
all the Australians and most of the
Maorilanders were volunteers. Upwards
of 76,000 —59,342 Australians and 16,688
Maorilanders —sleep in foreign graves.
Probably as many have died since,
although records have not been kept.
The survivors came back reluctant to
talk about their experiences, except in
their home circles, and the public was
equally disinclined to listen. In Australia
and Maoriland, as everywhere else,
people were weary of the long war, the
newspaper accounts of which, by conceal-
ing so much and misrepresenting so much
more, had perplexed and confused them.
'Besides, they now had other things to
think about: the influenza —which
caused 12,000 deaths in Australia alone
—the readjustment of industry to the
changed situation, jazz and the movies,
sport and politics. Returned soldiers
who had kept priceless records began to
write books ; but they were soon to learn
that there was no market for them. Even
Monash’s account of his great 1918 cam-
paign did not sell. In this way the
beginnings of a Digger literature were
blighted for 14 years. And (possibly as
a result of this neglect) Australia still
awaits its Digger dramas and Digger
talking pictures, though it has had to put
up with hundreds of Hollywood films
showing the Doughboy winning the war.
There was a general desire to be gener-
ous to the returning warriors and to the
families of those who did not return,
and in the flush years money was not
stinted. But veterans who had jobs or
businesses to go back to fared much
better than those who took politicians’
promises for gospel. In Australia 20,000
Diggers learned too late that they had
been placed on absurdly-overvalued
land on which it was next to impossible
to make a living under normal condi-
tions, impossible when conditions were
below normal. Thousands more have
had reason to curse the day they entered
into possession of their “war-service
homes.” Returned-soldier Preference
Acts have been passed but have nowhere
been enforced.
In one respect the men of the A.I.F.
and the N.Z.E.F. have not fulfilled anti-
cipations. It was thought that they would
take charge of politics, as Grant’s sol-
diers did in the U.S.A. Pessimists pointed
to the grotesque increase in the Civil War
pensions bill which resulted from the
manoeuvres of the G.A.R. (it amounted
to 75 million dollars in 1887), and to the
absorption of a large part of the time of
Congress and a succession of Presidents
in attending to grievances, many of them
bogus, of Union soldiers, real and alleged,
and gloomily prophesied corresponding
developments in these countries. They
also predicted that returned soldiers
would virtually monopolise the high
offices of State. None of these things
has happened.
Although the strain of the war
was far greater than has been realised
by those who did not attend it and has
had tragic after-effects, war pensions ex-
penditure has not increased. On the
contrary, it has diminished—from
£7,389,700 in 1920-21 to £6,800,000 in
1933-34. In the same 13 years old-age
and invalid pensions expenditure has gone
up from £5,151,200 to £10,963,000, and it
is expected to reach £12,000,000 this year.
So far from pressing the claims of
war-pensioners in season and out
of season the Diggers’ organisations
accepted on their behalf, without so
much as a murmur, the severest
of the cuts made during the financial
emergency of 1931—the p.c. taken
from the pensions of “dependants”
—and remained silent while public-
service unions and old-age pensioners’
organisations complained and threatened.
And they have set their faces grimly
against mendicancy. They drove returned-
soldier musicians off the streets, even
where the general public was prepared to
tolerate them, as in the case of the bands
which suddenly disappeared about 1921
—quite good bands some of them were —
and members who neglect businesses into
which they have been helped are sternly
called to account. And the R.S.S.I.L.A.
and the Limbless and T.B. Soldiers have
rejected all attempts to drag them into
politics. Men of all parties are to be
found among them, but the associations
march behind no party, nor have they
ever had any use for the proposal,
advanced from time to time, that they
should form a party of their own. And
their attitude is not likely to change, even
though it becomes more and more evident
that it is no advantage to a candidate,
or to a member seeking promotion, to
have a returned-soldier’s badge.
Tasmania recently witnessed the spec-
tacle of a victorious Caucus, gathered
under the plum-tree, distributing plums
among all the re-elected Labor Assembly-
men except a V.C. From 1869 till 1901
all the Presidents, except Cleveland, were
ex-soldiers. Australia has had a Prime
Minister who served in the British
Army, but it has only one returned-
soldier Premier, Dr. Argyle, and only
one returned-soldier Opposition-leader—
Mr. Latham in Westralia. Dr. Argyle is,
in fact, the only A.I.F. man who has
ever been Premier. This may seem in-
credible, but here is the list of Premiers
since the peace:—
N. S. Wales.—Storey, Dooley, Fuller,
Lang, Bavin, Lang and Stevens.
Victoria. —Peacock, Prendergast, Allan,
Hogan, McPherson, Hogan and Dr. Argyle.
Queensland. —Theodore, Gillies, McCor-
mack, Moore and Forgan Smith.
South Australia. —Barwell, Gunn, Hill,
Butler, Hill, Richards and Butler.
Westralia. —Colebatch, Mitchell, Collier.
Mitchell and Collier.
Tasmania. —Lyons, McPhee, Lee and
Ogilvie.
Perhaps, after all, things would be
better if the veterans of the A.N.Z.A.C.
and their old companions had put
their weight into politics. Without striv-
ing for an unrealisable political partner-
ship, they might, by brotherly co-opera-
tion, have given Australia and Maoriland
a common defence policy—they could cer-
tainly have prevented the abandonment
of compulsory training and the whittling
away of the defences on both sides of the
Tasman. And unquestionably they would
have tried to promote trade between
their countries, instead of letting it drift,
as the existing breed of politicians has
done, with the result that Maoriland
imports of Australian produce, measured
in sterling, declined from £5,460.300 in
1921 to £3,258,700 in 1929—and there
has been a further fall since. And by
their very example they might have
stifled the separatist tendencies that
have arisen in Australia. Be that as it
may, the Diggers remain a great force
for good in each Dominion. They are
a sure shield against social revolu-
tion. They have no use for war, but they
know that its horrors are not to be
averted merely by paying lip-service to
peace. And until the Last Post is
sounded over the last Digger—and after,
for Anzac Day will not perish—they will
keep alive splendid traditions in coun-
tries where people are apt to be unmind-
ful of what was won and preserved for
them by sacrifice.
BUILDING A BREAD
MONOPOLY.
At the beginning of the depression a
Victorian Commission found that the
“chief function of the Master Bakers’
Association” was “to aim at maintaining
fixed prices for bread.” The influence
of the association was such that when
bakers offended millers refused to supply
them with flour. The Piddington Com-
mission of 1932 discovered somewhat
similar conditions in vogue in N. S.
Wales. A miller’s letter was quoted:
On turning up our records we find you
have fallen foul of the Master Bakers’
Association. Can you tell us the reason?
Otherwise we are afraid we cannot supply
y0u....
But nothing has yet been seen to match
a proposed agreement prepared for cir-
culation among bakers in the County of
Cumberland (N.S.W.). It is accompanied
by a printed letter which asserts that
the agreement is “designed to save the
industry from drowning in the flood of
present trade insanities.”
I have no hesitation in saying if this
agreement gets the measure of support it
deserves, the unity of those members sign-
ing it will be of such force that they
will be able to enforce any disciplinary
measures necessary upon any transgressor
of the standards set:
The controlling authority is to be a
committee of millers and bakers. Bakers
are asked to agree not to sell bread
(“wholesale, retail or for Government
relief”) at a price lower than that
fixed by a general meeting, or to
buy from any miller not a party
to the agreement or at a price other
than that fixed by the millers. They
are not to acquire bread after a given
date from any vendor not a regular cus-
tomer before the agreement has force.
A baker may not even sell his business
or part of it except under terms of the
agreement or with the consent of the
committee. He must supply all details
asked for regarding his business, and on
request must allow a chartered account-
ant to examine his books for the com-
mittee and take extracts from them if
necessary. If he breaks any of these ar-
rangements, the committee will have
power “in its absolute discretion” to fine
him up to £5O for each breach.
And he will not be allowed to take
any other baker’s customer without con-
sent. If he refuses to restore a customer
when taken, the committee may assess
him at a minimum of £3O and maximum
of £6O damages per 100 weekly loaves
involved. The fine will go to the baker
who has lost the custom.
Millers, for their part, are not to sell
flour below a price fixed under the agree-
ment, or allow rebate concessions not
allowed by the committee, or
sell or supply or cause to be sold or sup-
plied flour within the County of Cumber-
land to any baker who is not a party to
the agreement or approved by the com-
mittee, or sell or transfer a business or
part thereof without the consent of the
committee.
All overdue accounts as between bakers
and millers are to be funded (it
came out during the Piddington in-
quiry that the bakers of N.S.W.
owed the mills £800,000) and placed in
trust with a nominee of the Millers’
Association. And any baker who owes
an overdue account is to pay an extra
13s. 4d. per ton for his flour to the
trustee, who is to liquidate the debt with
it. Interest on overdue accounts is to
be fixed at 4\ p.c. It will be a complete
tie-up, if arranged. A man who sells his
business must remain in control till his
successor signs up. The committee will
have full power to expend its funds in
its own way.
And the consumers? How they are to
be served may be estimated from a fixa-
tion-of-prices clause. In 1919, when
flour was £lO 17s. 6d. a ton and wheat
4s. 9d. a bushel, the Inter-State Commis-
sion thought that 3|d. to 4d. per 21b.
loaf would be a fair price for bread.
Wheat is about 3s. 6d. a bushel in Syd-
ney and flour has just been raised ss.
,to £9 ss. per ton. Bread is over
the counter and s£d. delivered by cart.
The agreement provides that when
f.a.q. wheat is 2s. 6d. a bushel the price
of flour is “not to exceed £8 a ton, and is
not to be affected more than ss. for
each fall in the price of wheat by Id.”
The maximum for bread, with flour at
£lO per ton, is to be sd. wholesale, s£d.
over the counter and 6d. for house
delivery the same as in 1920-21, when
flour was £l9 per ton and wheat 9s. a
bushel.
If this agreement is accepted, bakers
and millers will hold the public in the
hollow of their hands and the bread
supply of half the population of N. S.
Wales will cease to be subject to competi-
tion. Until 1937 it will be in the hands
of a huge private utility organisation able
to dragoon the public and its own mem-
bers at its own sweet will. Straight-out
socialisation could scarcely be more un-
desirable from the public’s point of view.
FILM QUOTAS.
“This proposal [for a Victorian film-quota]
is worthy of support from all people who
regard the film with hope.”
—“Canboy” ( B . 25/7/’34).
As one who happened to be in London
when the British film quota was intro-
duced, who was in Paris when the French
imposed their quota and who has seen
many British and some French films
since, the proposal strikes me as running
counter to practically all the movie
lessons of the past seven years.
“Quota Quickies” have been a byword
in England ever since the quota experi-
ment was made there. All kinds of
remedies have been tried with the object
of diminishing the flow of rubbish which
caused British films to get such a bad
name here. There is talk now of experi-
menting with Germany’s Kontingent
system, which is said to have discouraged
the output of utterly worthless films in
the Fatherland. But England has been
importing much more valuable things
from Germany than quota-antidotes in
the past year; namely, directors and
actors, many of them victims of Hitler’s
anti-Semitic campaign.
English films are becoming popular,
even in the U.S.A., for other reasons, un-
connected with the quota. Though
“Cavalcade” wasn’t made in England, it
emphasised that all English actors were
not effeminate boys with bleats, and that
all English actresses were not frumps
whose favorite method of getting a laugh
was to rush about in their underclothes.
And it gave the final blow to an English
school which has made scorn of the
talkies a cult. The City began putting
money into the trade in earnest, and
many British, Continental and American
stars began to leave Hollywood for
Elstree. In Australia in 1930 British film
imports were 8.2 p.c. of the total; last
year they were 25.7 p.c., and the propor-
tion is still rising.
How have the British done it? Not by
turning out films which, to quote “Cau-
boy,” give us an
impression of life in the form of a
sort of visual music, a rhythmic pattern
of light and shade, of sound and silence.
On the contrary. Part of their success is
due to their acceptance of a truth which
every great film-producer from Chaplin
onwards has realised ; namely, that 85
per cent, of those who go regularly to
the pictures have child-minds. This is
not to say that film audiences are un-
critical. Inside the ambit of what they
are used to and understand, they are as
indignantly critical as children; and
Hollywood has given them high standards
in many respects. An Australian audi-
ence, for example, will applaud a pro-
duction such as “Morning Glory,” which
has an idiotic story, and is full of theatri-
cal folk who never existed outside a
cheap novelette ; but the cast must be
efficient, the settings gorgeous, the dresses
expensive and the technical processes
perfect. A film-director who told the
truth about stage-mad girls like the
heroine of “Morning Glory,” or about
gangsters, business magnates, typists or
squatters’ daughters, would ruin his em-
ployers in short order. The same if he
made arty attempts to tamper with the
formula which has become a tradition as
regards the presentation of film romances.
Ufa tried it in Germany. The first thing
ex-Ufa directors were told in Holly-
wood was to “lay off the modernistic
stuff.”
The talkie business is essentially inter-
national. Nearly all the most effective
movies, whether from Hollywood or
Elstree, have had both Americans and
Britons in their casts ; and in many cases
the directors and several of the players
have been Germans, Swedes or Austrians.
The Australian film industry will only
succeed, as Britain’s industry did, by
importing foreign blood, and plenty of it.
The effect of State quotas (N. S. Wales is
to follow Victoria’s lead) will be to
burden the picture palaces with Bondi
variants of the inane Elstree films which
once kept our theatres empty.
The sole justification for a quota
system is as an economic weapon. If all
the States had had film quotas ten years
ago they might have used them to bar-
gain with Washington over, say, the appli-
cation of America’s immigration quota to
Australians. Now that Britain has gained
most of the 20.2 per cent, of the film-
import trade which America has recently
lost in this country, it might be possible
to talk film quotas in London with refer-
ence, for example, to Major Elliot’s meat-
quota proposals. But why should our
film-goers agonise for the financial benefit
of our cattle-breeders?

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Dicey and the New Guard.
Eric Campbell, of Sydney, who was
elected Commander-in-Chief of the New
Guard last week, celebrated the event by
announcing that “Law and Order Bri-
gades” would be organised among his
followers to keep the peace at U.A.P.
meetings. Anyone who disturbs a U.A.P.
meeting will get “a push in the face.”
Police Commissioner' Childs pointed
out next day that the maintenance of law
and order was “a matter solely for the
police, and not for any outside body,” to
which Mr. Campbell replied that “the
Police Commissioner should study Dicey’s
‘Constitutional Law’ ”:
Every subject, whether a civilian or a
soldier, whether what is called a servant
of the Government —such, for example,
as a policeman—or a person in no way con-
nected with the administration, not only
has the right, but is, as a matter of legal
duty, bound to assist in putting down
breaches of the peace.
The quotation is beside the point. The
police are entitled to eject disturbers
from public meetings. To quote Dicey:
Policeman X when he tells A to move
on, and compels him to do so, does not
put A in peril of life or limb, for A
knows for certain that, if he leaves the
meeting, he will not be further molested, or
that if he allows himself to be peaceably
arrested he has nothing to dread but tem-
porary imprisonment and appearance before
a magistrate, who will deal with his rights
in accordance with law.
If anybody else interferes unasked the
person attacked (Dicey again) “is justi-
fied in using against his assailant so
much force, even amounting to the in-
fliction of death, as is necessary for re-
pelling the attack.” Clearly the effect of
the intrusion at political meetings of
persons pledged to give anyone who, say,
interjects “a push in the face” must be
to cause riots. Then, and only then, will
private citizens be required “as a matter
of legal duty” to go to the assistance of
the police.
In an age which has witnessed so many
surrenders to Fascism and Communism,
British countries remain free because they
have stuck to what Dicey calls the Rule
of Law. It will be a bad day for Aus-
tralia if Australians ever substitute that
Rule for the rule of privately organised
Disorder Brigades.

Civilisation in Arnhem Land.
In 1923 several Japanese were .killed by
aboriginals off Caledon Bay in Arnhem
Land. It was said that they had inter-
fered with native women. Next year it
was reported that white women, sur-
vivors from the wreck of the Douglas
Mawson, were in the hands of Arnhem
Landers. There was enough color in
the story to lead Colonel Urquhart, the
Administrator, a man with 45 years’ inti-
mate police and northern native experi-
ence, to say that “the report, on the face
of it, is credible.”
The Government sent an expedition in
a ship which did not get to Caledon. It
foundered in a sea of laughter and a hur-
ricane of press tirades, above the storm oi;
which the voice of Admiral George
Pearce was heard confidently proclaiming
that “everything necessary was being
done by the Government.”
In succeeding years a few more
Japanese were picked off. Always the
same excuse was offered. The last slaugh-
ter was in 1932. A police party went
out. A section of it, armed only with
revolvers, was isolated, and one of its
members was killed. The force withdrew
to Groote Eylandt, whence came wireless
messages and photographs, some of which
were published in the evening press.
The Government, moved to despera-
tion, subsidised a missionary expedition
to persuade the alleged murderers to come
in and be dealt with. Apart from catch-
ing a severe attack of lecturitis, the good
men do not seem to have achieved
much ; but Frederick Grey, a trepanger,
who was providing food for sandflies on
the Caledon Beach, did better. He per-
suaded three naked persons to make the
trip to Darwin, where they were coaxed
into loincloths. A special ordinance
was passed to save their necks, and,
after their counsel’s admissions that they
killed their visitors through fear of
attack and because of interference with
native women, they were sentenced to
20 years’ hard labor apiece, at the end
of proceedings of which they could not
have understood a word. The Judge
said:
It is difficult to know what to do with
these natives. Probably the best and
kindest thing would be to hang them.
If conditions improve in Arnhem
Land and if the culprits behave them-
selves, his Honor may recommend their
release in four or five years.
The poor devils were, of course,
merely meting out justice to the invaders
according to local custom. If they were
hanged on the spot with a display of Gov-
ernment force, it might be the best thing
as a deterrent, though not the kindest.
Judges have always shown an extreme
distaste for being hanged themselves, and
natives are just as human. What has
been done to them is the kindest thing:
they are assured of good food, shelter
and the right to do nothing ( hard
labor” is the euphemistic term for that
at Fanny Bay). But nothing has hap-
pened which will stop aliens who inter-
fere with women in Arnhem Land from
being wiped out, along with other aliens
who may be innocent.
Unless strangers are warned definitely
away from this native preserve, the local
tribes are likely to qualify to the last
man for free Fanny Bay rations before
they waive their lethal customs.

The Kellys Were Bunglers.
N. S. Wales taxpayers who receive por-
tion of their income from another State,
and have therefore to send returns to the
Taxation Departments in that State and
their own, rise from the tasks imposed on
them with the savage conviction that
N. S. Wales robs them in cold blood.
In item 2 of the N.S.W. return, the tax-
payer drawing income from personal
exertion is required to state:
Gross salary, wages, allowances, bonuses,
stipend, overtime, etc. (including wages tax
and unemployment relief tax deducted.)
If he is an employee the wages tax
(usually lOd. in the £) is collected from
his pay without cost to the department.
But it is assessed as income, and in a few
months tax will be demanded on what
never went into his pocket.
On the list of allowable deductions
from taxable income there is a line for
the statement of State income tax and of
“unemployment relief and special income
and wages tax” ; but they are "for
Federal purposes only.” The Common-
wealth abstains from taxing amounts
actually paid in respect of these imposts.
So does Victoria. The Commonwealth
also exempts State income tax. N. S.
Wales makes its victims pay on what
it has extracted from them.
In item 13 of the N.S.W. document the
taxpayer has to return
Income from any source outside N. S.
Wales as per statement attached.
In Directions to Assist (and intimidate)
Taxpayers, it is set forth that
In addition to income liable to N.S.W.
State income tax, income derived by resi-
dents of N. S. Wales from sources outside
the State is subject to special income and
wages tax. The sources outside the State
include sources in any country or any State,
whether inside or outside Australia.
Such income, of course, is taxed at
“the sources outside the State” —taxed
twice in most cases, and thrice in many.
Imperfect as the Commonwealth Con-
stitution is, it does not permit N. S. Wales
to tax the property from which the
income is derived, but it permits N. S.
Wales to pounce on what it can get of
what is left of the income.
At the instance of the Government
which goes in for this Shylock business
proceedings of the State Parliament are
now opened with prayer. The prayer
should include a petition that the mind
of the Government may be cleansed of
cant and humbug.

Hindenburg Is Dead.
“El V.”: Only those who have been in
Germany can understand what the death
of Hindenburg means. For a British
parallel to him one must go back to
Wellington ; and the parallel is far from
complete. No angry Berliners ever
mobbed the victor of Tannenberg in the
street or smashed his windows. .
There are two Germanys —a Germany
of youth and a Germany of maturity.
Landholders, merchants, mature work-
ers and intellectuals born and edu-
cated before the war form a stable
section whose allegiance has always
been rather to the President than to
any Chancellor. But the youngsters,
bred to mass amusement, and to walk-
ing, talking and singing in crowds, are
Hitlerites. Hitler’s is the only Govern-
ment which has a Ministry of Youth. For
the young Hitler is the one hope of the
Empire. However anyone may hate his
principles, he represents the only co-
ordinated force and policy which the
country knows. If he were to fall, Ger-
many would be without hope of leader-
ship and her politics in chaos. Now
Hindenburg is dead, Old Germany is
without a head, and Hitler is without a
brake.
By the new “law” which combines the
Presidency with the Chancellorship,
Hitler becomes an absolute dictator.
Old Germany isn’t likely to relish the
prospect of what he may do in the next
year or so, during which he must face an
industrial crisis worse than any since
1923. At present, he is keeping millions
of Germans in work by the force of law
and paying for the upkeep of the unem-
ployed with a wage tax of 33 p.c. Elimi-
nation of profits and high-speed opera-
tion are choking the home market with
products which it cannot consume for the
moment, but currency restrictions have
paralysed overseas trade and will slow
down output to danger point.
With mistrustful nations all about
him—Poland, Russia, Austria, France,
Belgium and Britain —Hitler will find
himself in a dangerous corner. All
the world hopes that he will not
begin showing his claws, but if he
surmounts his industrial crisis he will
every year find it easier to be aggressive.
By 1940 there will be 13,000,000
Germans of military age who knew the
last war only as children, and 3,500,000
war veterans. Perhaps that is what is in
Mussolini’s mind when he predicts that
the greatest danger of war in Europe will
be a decade hence.

“Encouraging” the Tourist.
An Australian National Travel Associa-
tion exists to encoupage the tourist to
come to Australia. The N.S.W. Transport
Trust helps—so long as the tourist does
not show a disposition to do much
travel by road under conditions to which
he is accustomed.
In Sydney there are tourist and service-
car proprietors who cater for the sight-
seer, and so long as they keep him within
a 50-mile radius they may take him
where they will. The air of the streets
is free and most of the county of Cum-
berland is his.
But they mustn’t take him to the Blue
Mountains, unless they can persuade him
to go in a Government train or ’bus. If
he is taken to Katoomba he —through the
company which carries him—is taxed 6s.
for the return journey. ]f he goes to
Bathurst, the tax runs to 16s. Bd. return.
And if he fancies Jenolan he isn’t allowed
to go at all unless he travels by a Gov-
ernment service..
Government tourist ’buses have the
same tax as private vehicles —the fares
are the same as those on the private
’buses which include the impost. The
Government taxes the tourist and puts
the tax in its own pocket. It is like the
visitor’s impudence to want to spend
money going to Katoomba, so the Gov-
ernment takes about as much from him
as it would if he went to the bottle too
often instead, and got himself fined the
customary “ss. or the duration.”

The Making of Provincialists.
“Mandurah”: As The Bulletin put it,
a sufficient reply to the Westralian
secessionists could have been packed
into a few sentences. The costly
committee appointed by Lyons and
co. to do the job they shirked spread
itself over a book of 128 pages. Of this
706,840 copies are to be struck off at a
cost of £12,800 and distributed among
the electors of Westralia, South Aus-
tralia and Tasmania (the Lord and Mr.
Lyons only know what the South Aus-
tralians and Tasmanians have to do with
it) at a further cost of £9OO. Presumably
the committee’s fees and expenses will
swell the amount to £15,000.
Digests of the committee’s observa-
tions have appeared in the daily news-
papers. Most of them are obvious, and
I agree with all except this:
The Navigation Act imposes no serious
disability on West Australian shippers. The
existence of an efficient coastal service run-
ning to regular schedules confers general
benefit and is a necessary part of a national
system.
The second sentence is right; the first
is utterly wrong. The Navigation Act
has imposed serious disabilities on West-
ralian shippers and passengers.
Because of the monopoly it has estab-
lished, Westralians importing machinery
and the like from the Eastern States have
had to pay higher freight-rates than are
charged on corresponding goods from
Britain and the U.S.A. General-cargo
rates to Fremantle are 60s. per ton from
Brisbane, 435. from Sydney and 38s.
from Melbourne.
Because Westralians have been for-
bidden to travel from Fremantle and
other ports to ports in the Eastern States
in overseas steamers they have been made
provincial-minded.
Before the Navigation Act came into
force they could travel to Adelaide, Mel-
bourne, Sydney and Brisbane in British,
Italian, French and German, as well as
Australian, steamers. The competition
kept fares down and enabled those in a
position to take advantage of them to
broaden their minds. They rubbed shoul-
ders and exchanged ideas with people
strange to them. This brought home to
them the fact that the world is wide, and
that —great as Westralia looks on the
map and seems to them —Westralia is
only a small portion of it.
With the Navigation Act provincial-
ism came into its own. Exit the interest-
ing foreigner ; enter the kind of pas-
senger who, worthy as he might be, was
just a copy of the travelling Westralian
himself. The bagman, the draper, the
grocer, the typist, the school-teacher:
same old people; same old opinions;
same old everything. And with competi-
tion ruled out fares went sky-high. For
a return trip from Fremantle to Sydney
£33 was charged.
If Westralians have become provincial-
ists the authors of the Navigation Act and
the politicians who have enforced it have
helped to make them so. People may
now go from the mainland to Tas-
mania in overseas steamers. The corre-
sponding privilege is still denied to West-
ralians.

Medical Cheap Labor.
A rumpus about Balmain (N.S.W.) Hos-
pital employing unqualified medical
officers has led to the revelation that one
profession is not overcrowded. It was
sworn during the inquest on a man who
had died in the hospital that the only
member of the staff present when he
was brought in was a final-year medical
student, and the coroner was told that
“at present several hospitals have stu-
dents as r.m.os.” “Extraordinary!” re-
marked the coroner. The chief medical
officer replied that the student was “quite
able to attend to the duties” and was
“more capable than a number of medical
men we have had at the hospital.”
There are 2000 bachelors of medicine
on the rolls of Sydney University, and
450 students are going through the six-
year course which will give them their
licenses to kill or cure. They will find
magnificent jobs waiting for them when
they qualify. There are “now many hos-
pitals that want medical officers and can-
not get them,” even though they have
resorted to the frantic expedient of rais-
ing the old-time salary range of £5O-£lOO
to £2OO-£250. In other words, young
sawbones may graduate from the short-
hand-typist standard of remuneration
into the society of junior mechanics and
unskilled manual laborers.
He would be a lot better off in the
Mandated Territory. Salaries of New
Guinea lik lik doctors —who may have
been brought up as bakers or radio
operators —range from £3OO p.a. to £516
p.a., with long leave and other privileges.
Their duties are mainly the rough-and-
ready jobs of native-village surgery and
medicine. And they have a free hand -
there are no boards, commissions or
Ministers like Weaver.

“Democracy’s Peril.”
Thus F. A. Bland, Lecturer in Public
Administration at Sydney University:
Australians talk and think of govern-
ment in obsolete terms. If they could re-
capture the Wentworth tradition, they might
enable the universities to provide for
democracy its cultural foundations to com-
plement the material structure which has
been built by their physical and natural
scientists.
Mr. Bland should have another look at
the Wentworth tradition. Wentworth
bought 20,000,000 acres from innocent
Maori chiefs for £2OO and a life annuity
of the same sum. He “swore eternal
vengeance” when the Government over-
rode his purchase.
He opposed the taxation of squatters.
He formed an association to import
coolie labor from the Indies, and when
public opinion forced him to abandon
the scheme he continued to use Chinese
labor on his stations. He tried to re-
vive transportation of convicts after it
had been abandoned, and fought for it
for 10 years. He actually opposed the
establishment of a bicameral Parlia-
mentary system in Australia when it was
first mooted, and when he did join the
movement for responsible government he
was as much concerned with the control
of the elected House by an unelected
Upper House as with anything. He sug-
gested the establishment of a peerage, with
hereditary membership of the Legislative
Council. He said that “he had no wish
to sow the seeds of a future democracy."
He eventually retired from Australian
politics “alarmed by the growing radical
spirit,” and spent the end of his days in
England.
There were elements of greatness in
Wentworth, but his policy was no model
for a modern democracy.

"AND IT'S POINTED WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Cauboy”: The talkies have had their
say in the new His Majesty’s in Mel-
bourne. Comfort and modernity have
been architect Hollinshed’s watchword.
There are 400 fewer seats than in the old
auditorium, with the result that painful
incidents such as I once saw in H.M.’s
at a matinee are unlikely to occur. A
young man got up hastily in an interval
and tried to emerge from his central
position via the left route. After forcing
himself past a series of knees he came
against an insurmountable obstacle—a
stout lady who turned out to be wedged
into her seat, and whose lap protruded
too far for the cape to be doubled.
The agitated youth turned to the right-
about and fought his way almost to
freedom by the other route, only to en-
counter a precisely similar obstacle. His
anguished expression as he returned to
his seat would have melted the heart of
any management.

W.L. : The Otaki, just sold by the
N.Z. Shipping Co. to the Clan Line, has
a war history ; she is the craft that nearly
sank the Moewe off Cape Town in March,
1917. Every foodship carried a gun and
naval gunners. The Otaki, on her way to
M.L. in ballast, met the Moewe off Cape
Agulhas. She had one 4.7 gun against
the raiders two 7.5, two 6in., six 3in. and
four torpedo tubes; her speed was 15
knots against the other’s 22 knots.
Obviously it was an unequal contest, but
while the Moewe fired 30 rounds and two
torpedoes, killing four men and wound-
ing nine, the Otaki fired nine rounds,
killing five men, wounding ten and start-
ing a fire near the Moewe’s magazine.
The end was inevitable, but the Moewe
was right on her side and the German
crew had to work all night to get her
straight again. Captain Smith went down
and the crew were taken to Germany as
prisoners*.

ing a few feet away which bashed in my

“Cutting Out”: A form of crime
hardly known elsewhere flourishes in
Brisbane, the stealing of large and ex-
pensive motor-yachts. The latest craft
to disappear is worth £2OOO, and a search
down the Bay and out to sea by aero-
plane has failed to locate her, though
how she passed the Cape Moreton signal
station unnoticed—she must have been
stolen after midnight, and it is a long run
to the Cape from where she was moored
—is a puzzle. The thieves, as others have
done before them, are probably cutting
straight across to the Solomons. One
lot got to New Guinea in the stolen
Zamora. Later they were reported to
have called at Darwin and Broome. After
that, neither launch nor crew was heard

“sth Q. 1.8.”: The South African
Soldiers’ Association in the Ma State
has been agitating for some time for
a grant for a memorial. Its action is
rather belated: both Brisbane and Mel-
bourne put up notable memorials within
a few years after the close of fighting,
and paid for them by voluntary contri-
butions, though in Queensland the Gov-
ernment lent a hand. The S.A.S.A. is
also seeking preference for those of its
members who di<l not see service with
the A.I.F. Candidates at the coming
Federal elections are to be circularised
and asked to state their views. Logically
the ex-South Africans snould have
preference, but the movement to obtain
it is hardly worth while. The Prefer-
ence to Returned Soldiers Act is largely
a farce, its provisions being continually
ignored or dodged by employers except
in certain outstanding cases. Even where
glaring breaches of the Act are exposed
the offenders escape penalties. Prefer-
ence is a gift of fairy gold, turning, when
examined, to withered leaves.

near Warrnambool (B. 25/7/’34), but the
fact is that Henry Kingsley (author of
“Geoffrey Hamlyn”) made a Spanish
galleon out of an old wreck (probably a
large whaling barge) that he saw at Arm-
strong’s Bay during his sojourn in Vic-
toria in 1853. Nobody had ever heard of
the “mahogany ship” until the appear-
ance of “Geoffrey Hamlyn.” The
mahogany color of the old wreck was
no doubt caused by whale oil.
“Leo Lear”: “C. Coral’s” mahogany
ship is a myth. I have done more
research than most into the history
of West Victoria from 1800 to 1851 and
never come across any mention of such
a ship. Earle, in his rare and valuable
“History of Port Fairy,” written at the
end of last century, says there is no
foundation for the story, except that a
comparatively modern trader was wrecked
on the spot. If anyone wishes to unearth
the derelict, there is no mystery about the
spot to probe. From early records left
by the late Capt. T. H. Osbourne, I
gather the timbers lie 142° 23' 25" E.
long, and 38° 21' 24" S. lat. So get out

“Chi Chi”: The suggestion that the
possession of black blood is betrayed by
the half-moons at the bottom of the nails
being “liver-colored” (B. 1/8 / ’34) is
hardly accurate. West and East Indian
tradition has laid down that the tell-
tale sign is opal-colored, and so are the
“whites” of the eyes, no matter how far
back the tarbrush was put on the family
palette. The “rolling-eye” theory ad-
vanced by the same authority applies
only to those of negro blood, and then
only as far as the quadroon. Any native
of the Southern States of the U.S.A. who
may read this will bear me out. As for
that multicolored community which
monopolises many of the minor services
in India and is proud of its Portuguese
names and its diluted “white” blood, I
am prepared to make oath that, though
the opal tint shows in finger-nails and
eyeballs, the latter don’t “roll.”

shack have been reproduced in the press.
It is near Harvey, in the south-west, but
it seems very doubtful whether the poet
ever saw it —more doubtful than whether
Captain Cook ever inhabited the York-
shire structure which has been torn up
by the roots and transferred to Mel-
bourne. Gordon landed at Bunbury at
the end of 1866 with a partner named
Mount and a consignment of sheep from
S. Aus. The venture wasn’t a success, and
the poet, as far as is known, didn’t
remain in the district very long. Mount
certainly had a camp somewhere near
the site of the present log hut, but this
was burned down long ago, and the
oldest inhabitants are sceptical about the
‘ Gordon cottage” tradition, though the
place has long had some faint appeal
to tourists. This seems to have been
Gordon’s second trip to Westralia, his
first having been made to the nor’-wesl
a couple of years sooner. As far as 1
know, there is no reference to either,
direct or indirect, in any of his verses.

“Harold Hardupp”: A human with the
hibernating habit was the subject of an
inquest in Sydney the other day ; accord-
ing to a landlady with whom he had
stayed for seven years, he was accustomed
to remain in his room entirely during the
months of June and July, apparently
contenting himself with one meal a day.
He died suddenly, his demise not being
discovered until the arrival of the tray
which was the only interruption to his
rest. The landlady’s evidence left the
impression that during the rest of the
year he had plenty of occupation ; when
it failed he settled down to sleep through
the worst part of the winter.
“Wagga”: The old gaol at Portland
(Vic.), solidly constructed of bluestone
blocks, is no longer used for its original
purpose ; and latterly its doors have been
flung open as a free lodging place for
out-of-work men. The old wooden
stocks which were once outside the
prison gates have long since disappeared.
The gaol has had many strange occu-
pants, amongst them a big batch of
Chinese on their way to the gold dig-
gings. At Hamilton they were bailed
up by the police for being without per-
mits, and, having no money to pay the
capitation tax, they were imprisoned at
Portland. Then someone hit on the idea
of allowing some of the Celestials to go
off and earn a bit of cash on the fields,
while the others remained in gaol until
their friends came back to bail them out.
The prisoners were put on to work in
the local botanical gardens from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and did such an excellent job
that the curator was sorry when their
compatriots returned with the money to
release them.
"Finn”: The Centenary Council has
authorised the expenditure of £95,000 on
Melbourne’s birthday feast. The prepara-
tion and dishing-up of the banquet—-
salaries, organisation, publicity—are to
cost £31,000; the garnishing, pageantry
and decoration, £16,500. The solid in-
gredients of the cake which visitors are
invited to sample will cost £8100; music
will have £5OOO spent on it, art £l5OO,
history £l5OO and literature £lOO. Mel-
bourne for culture!

1 lie hand of Time has quenched the fires of
Hate
t hat in the hell of war must blaze and glow.
And even, even if it were not so,
’Twas never ours to wait
To pay due tribute to a sturdy foe
What though it found him old, his country's
call,
He led them all in battle’s storm and stress;
In victory’s promise or defeat’s duress,
Unchanging type through all
Of rugged constancy and steadfastness.
We have our ageless heroes, and to them
In hero-worship sheer our hearts we gave,
And some were wise and some were only
brave.
We join in requiem
Before another nation’s open grave.
A soldier he who never knew surcease
In battles such as none have known before;
A dauntless leader, aye, and something
more—
A champion for peace,
Even though born and bred to sombre war.

T. THE R.


“Tion”: The authorities at Norfolk
Island evidently set their one policeman
to detective work before giving the
recent dictation test in German (B.
25/7/’34). On one previous occasion
when an “immigrant” was classed as un-
desirable (for being caught making
“home-brew,” the local pastime), he was
rather carelessly given a dictation test in
French. He passed with first-class
honors, frequently correcting the pro-
nunciation of the schoolmaster, who had
been appointed examiner.
* * *
“F.S.”: The uproar over Rayner
Hoff’s “death’s-head plaque” raises the
question whether any artist has ever
invented a symbolism that satisfied
everybody. The loyal symbol for patrio-
tic Britishers is either Britannia with her
decorated cartwheel or John Bull. In
France a scrawny figure in a travesty
of a Highland costume gripping an enor-,
mous pipe between protruding teeth is
identified with perfide Albion. The
Briton retaliates by refusing to recog-
nise France’s gloriously romantic Mari-
anne, and prefers the bearded Gaul of
the caricaturist and the low comedian.
The latest example of defective symbol-
ism is the twopenny centenary stamp
issued by the P.M.G. The naked abori-
ginal who is approaching the south bank
of the Yarra, conveniently cleared of its
boatsheds, is presumably a Rip Van
Winkle who has been asleep for 100
years, and is amazed to see the State
Theatre and the spires of St. Paul’s stand-
ing on the site of his last camping-
ground.
•* * * *
“Hamer”: The proposal to spoil
Bondi Beach by the creation of an
amusement park at the southern end has
been rightly turned down, but some
similar venture is to be taken in hand
at Maroubra. Amusement parks are no
new thing in Sydney, but the public has
never warmed to them, doubtless because
of the abundance of free amusements.
In the early days Sydney’s old “Paddy’s
Market,” on the borders of Belmore Park,
had a “fair” attachment; but Wonder-
land City, which 'supplanted the bank-
rupt Bondi Aquarium, was the first real
amusement park. After an early boom
William Anderson closed it down, feeling
that his theatrical luck was leaving him.
The White City was the next venture.
Its life was short. Randwick Council has
removed the frayed remains of the
Coogee amusement pier, another venture
in imported amusements and the most
dismal failure of all.
* * * *
"Craiser”: The site of the new His
Majesty’s in Melbourne has been a
theatrical strongpost since the ’eighties.
As the Hippodrome, it provided gladia-
torial combats and international athletic
contests until Jules Joubert got a 30-
vear lease and built the Alexandra. In
collaboration with Dion Boucicault, he
planned to open it with a grand grand-
opera season ; but the company failed to
arrive in time, so the curtain went up on
Bad Lads,” a thin farce comedy pro-
duced by Captain de Burgh, who had
graduated to the stage from the British
Army. However, the scribes of the day
were equal to the occasion, and their
adjectives would do service for the new’
building without anybody noticing any
difference. Dampier shook the boards at
the Alexandra, and Sarah Bernhardt
slipped down in an interval from the
Princess to see the wonder of one of his
seasons —a water-filled tank to represent
a river. The career of the theatre closed
in 1898 with a season of the Wil-
fred Hayes company, playing “Wilful
“Is your daughter happy now she’s married?”
“Why, yes. She doesn’t care for her husband; but, then, a girl can’t have
EVERYTHING.”
Murder.” It reopened in 1900 as Her
Majesty’s. Stones belonging to all the
three previous buildings are to be found
in the present structure.

“General Prac.”: There are reasons
(and I don’t forget the cancer question)
why most of us do not exceed the
Psalmist’s age. For one thing, our
arteries grow old ahead of us, and men
suffer the more. Three and a half times
more men than women drop suddenly
in their tracks from this cause, by reason
of heart or circulatory failure. Three
times as many men as women commit
“What the devil are you laughing for? I can’t see anything to laugh at.”
suicide, simply because men worry over
unemployment and financial distresses
more than women do. Suicidal females are
of two sorts: young girls in the throes
of their love affairs and unstable ladies
of middle age. Here are a few things
worth remembering. Motor-cycles, in
Australia at all events, are just as deadly
as motor-cars; alcohol does not cause
death by the process of shrinkage of the
liver called cirrhosis, and the bulk of us
will die from arterial disease —the pres-
ence in our blood of a few extra blobs
of fat. And in nearly all adult bodies
one finds the signs of long-extinct tuber-
culosis.
“Retired Killer”: “2 x 4” (B. 1/8/’34)
objects to my advocacy of a sawn-off
shotgun as the right weapon for bank
clerks on the ground that the “scatter”
from such a weapon “at anything over
20ft.” might injure other persons besides
the bandit. Nevertheless, I will guaran-
tee a gun with 18in. barrels to leave a
satisfactory pattern on a fleeing bandit
not only up to 20ft. but to 20 yards. My
critic suggests that, to ascertain the ex-
tent of my ignorance, I have a go at a
house door with a 12 bore, presumably
at the 20ft. referred to. A t r/ach a range
the shot would practically be massed
solid and would drive a hole through the
stoutest door. I have been handling fire-
arms ever since boyhood, and have shot
with gun and rifle practically everything
encountered in many lands, save trapped
pigeons. Once I specially studied loads
and patterns for shotguns. Here is one of
many records, made with an old cylinder
12-bore firing 181 pellets of No. 4 shot.
At 30 yards the pellets in a 30-inch
circle numbered 109 ; at 35. 89 ; at 40,
60 ; and at 50, 47. Later tests showed
the ratio increasing with improved cylin-
der and modified choke until, with a
full choke, 181 pellets were in the circle
at 30 yards, and 89 at 50. Official tests
show even better figures than these.
* * * *
“Mulyan”: Norfolk Island, so much
in the spotlight lately, was the scene of
Australia’s first shipbuilding enterprise.
The shortage of shipping in the 1790’s
spurred the inhabitants to build the Nor-
folk, a sloop of 25 tons, to trade between
the island and Sydney. The work took
them a couple of years ; everything, in-
cluding the sextant, was home-made.
When the little boat reached Sydney on
her maiden voyage, she was comman-
deered by Governor Hunter and handed
to Flinders and Bass, an outrage that the
islanders have never allowed to be for-
gotten. The Norfolk was the first boat
that sailed through Bass Strait and
around the Apple Isle, a voyage that
occupied 12 weeks.
. * * i!< *
“Lord Luvus”: A somewhat prosaic
light was thrown on the mystery of the
perpetual youth of Victorian barmaids
by a deputation from the Barmaids’
League which waited on Chief Secretary
Macfarlan. Since the passage of the 1917
Act prohibiting the granting of any
further licenses, the number of Hebes
Jhas declined from 3685 to 3668. One case
was cited of a lady, now living in retire-
ment, who joined up before the war, and
is now 62. Her license was found to be
in the possession of a charming wench
of 27. The fact is, according to the
league, that licenses have been sold,
borrowed and even duplicated so fre-
quently that the documents are becoming
indecipherable. Since the Act does nol
provide that barmaids should affix their
signatures or finger-prints to the parch
ment, detection is difficult. Incidentally,
it is complained that the readiness with
which licenses can be traded has caused
unemployment amongst fully-qualified
handle-pullers.
* * s’c
“Jobber”: Pars, about this chap or
that being or having been the champion
buckjump rider of Australia give me a
pain. No such champion exists ;it would
be impossible to pick one. I, in common
with many others, have known chaps in
the bush who could ride anything that
ever looked through a bridle and who
would travel miles to do so, but to get
some of them into an exhibition ring
would be impossible. Some good yarns
of such have been told by Will Ogilvie in
verse —“The Riding of the Rebel”—and
by F. D. Davison in his book “Forever
Morning.” Davison’s description of the
riding of a buckjumper is miles ahead of
anything I. have ever read ; I sat on the
stockyard fence and watched Andy on
the outlaw from start to finish.
* * * *
“Physiologue”: “Spare Sawbones” (B.
18/7/’34) is far from the track himself.
Carbon monoxide is easily expelled from
the blood. I have had half my haemo-
globin saturated with it and got rid of
it in a few hours. Also I have examined
biocd taken from a suicide and found
only an insignificant amount left. Often,
after removal from the dangerous atmo-
sphere, victims breathe for long enough
to ventilate most of the stuff from the
blood before they expire, and adminis-
tration of a mixture of 5 p.c. CO2 and 95
p.c. oxygen expedites the removal con-
siderably. Personally, I should regard
blood transfusion in a case of CO
poisoning as a dangerous impertinence.
As regards the harmlessness of carbon
dioxide I would not be so dogmatic as
“Spare Sawbones.” Five per cent, is a
valuable respiratory stimulant. I have
felt somewhat “dopey” while breathing
10 p.c. Anything over 40 p.c. is dan-
gerous even in the presence of abund-
ance of oxygen. A breath of pure CO2
causes laryngeal spasm.

“Shep.”: “General Prac.’s” statement
that war doctors cherished jars of blood
ready for the succor of the wounded
(B. 25/7/’34) is new to me, and I’ve seen
scores of aid-post and dressing-station
medicoes at work. We were always led to
believe that blood being transfused into a
patient must be absolutely similar to his
own ; in that case I hate to think of the
number of different samples of gore a
doc. would have to cart around. Indeed,
every doctor knew he only had to stick
his head out of a dressing station or
operating theatre and ask for a volun-
teer blood donor to start a rush, seeing
that the donor would be given 14 days’
Blighty leave to compensate for the
blood taken from him. Our orderly
officer one day asked a parade of our
stretcher-bearers how many would give
blood if called on. Every man stepped
forward. A bucketful for 14 days out
of the Somme would have seemed cheap
just then.
DUMPER-PROOF BATHERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"The smart bathing costumes designed for next
summer are scantier than ever, but it is claimed that
they are ‘dumper-proof’ and will cling to the wearer
in any emergency.”
They’re fragile and piquant creations, be sure,
Expressly designed to display
A generous helping of dorsal allure
In the glow of the sands and the spray.
They’re classical drapes for all species of shapes,
When skirts are discarded and jumpers,
And the best of them is—what ho! and gee-
whiz!—
That they’re wholly impervious to dumpers.
They’re cunningly proof against dumpers.
For many a year we’ve had backless costumes
As adjuncts to subtle romance,
But the mermaids who swam in them knew,
one assumes,
They were taking a bit of a chance.
For the waves that are oft so caressingly soft
Can deal unmistakable thumpers,
Rude buffets, no less, that disorganise dress
When it doesn’t cling tight in the dumpers.
You’ve got to watch out in the dumpers.
There’s a story they bruit of a girl in a suit
That furnished the nattiest show
When the weather was fair, cut audaciously
square
And tied at the back with a bow.
But designers somehow had quite failed to
allow
For the ocean’s occasional bumpers,
And —calamity sore!—she drifted ashore
Despoiled of her garb by the dumpers,
Stripped bare by those dissolute dumpers.
Then here’s to the latest for camera snaps!
And it’s surely a notable thing
’Twill cling all the closer to what it enwraps
The less there is of it to cling.
Though it won’t, one suspects, be approvingly
eyed
By wowsers and Grundys and frumpers,
One likes to reflect that, whatever belidc,
Tt’s nothing to dread from the dumpers;
It rustles defiance at dumpers.

POLITICAL POINTS
There is to be another Labor selection
ballot for Bourke. If Maurice Black-
burn is beaten it may mean his finish
as a politician. When he decided to go
after the seat Anstey was quitting, he
withdrew his name from the ballot for
Clifton Hill, which he represented in the
Assembly, and the nomination went to
H. M. Cremean. He has now retired
as M.L.A.. Everard, the member for
Evelyn, is the new Speaker.
In number and cost of royal commis-
sions, Lyons-Latham has rivalled Bruce-
Page. When the accounts were last made
up Grants had drawn £2061 and Wheat
£5622 ; and before the 13th Parliament
dispersed wagers were made at Canberra
that Petrol would cost more than Grants
and Wheat combined. Wheat and Petrol
are still collecting.
Though Scullinaries and Langsters
have declared a truce in Victoria and
S.A., the war is still raging in other
States. By way of avenging rebuffs suf-
fered in Queensland, Lang’s newspaper
applies the letters T.-B. (Theodore-
Bailey) to members of the predominant
group in Queensland. And when the
Westralian Labor Government was men-
tioned in the House of Reps, the other
day Ward hotly protested that it wasn’t
a Labor Government.
Reporting the sacrifice of the ex-Presi-
dent of the Senate, Perth’s secesh weekly
gleefully explained that “the younger
generation of Nats, recognised that
Kingsmill was a dud and would wreck
any team.” J. McSmith, M.L.A., the
editor, was not of this opinion when set-
ting out on his political career. He asked
Kingsmill to speak at the first McSmith
meeting, and Kingsmill’s speech was in-
comparably better than the candidate’s.
Harry Bailey, who was Hogan’s Minis-
ter of Lands, has joined the Cockies and
is to stand for Wannon. Hogan reports
that the Agrarians have asked him to
come out for Ballarat, the U.A.P. too ;
but if he decides to have a go it will be
as a representative of no party.
Hogan has lost his case against the
Vic. A.L.P. central executive. State Jus-
tice Gavan Duffy found that the ex-
Premier had been wrongfully refused en-
dorsement and “excluded” from the
party; the High Court allowed the
executive’s appeal for these main reasons:
The organisation is a political machine
designed to secure social and political
changes. The policy of the law is against
interference in the affairs of voluntary
associations which do not confer upon
members civil rights susceptible of private
enjoyment.
So law is the boss’s servant.
Commonwealth Statistician’s summary
of public finance shows that £7,955,000
was added in 1933-34 to the £4,408,000
deficit of Commonwealth and States for
1932- Leaving out the Common-
wealth surpluses—there would have been
none had Britain insisted on the war-
debt payments —the States have gone to
the bad by £14,700,000 in two years.
Wool returned £57,125,526 Australian
last year, an improvement of £20,717,593.
The Commonwealth and N.S.W. Govern-
ments seem to take it for granted that the
1933- figure will be maintained. Yet
tops have had a record fall since the be-
ginning of May— per pound in fine
lines—and almost every woolbuying
country in Europe is in turmoil or dif-
ficulty.
Sales tax returned £896,000 more than
Lyons’s estimate last year. It has been
a great yielder of revenue, averaging
£8,500,000 p.a. the last three years, and
it is not very costly to collect. Objec-
tions to it are that it is an addition in-
stead of an alternative to income tax,
and that it is imposed capriciously and
is duplicated. For example, photo-
graphers pay it on their chemicals and
again on their prints.
R. A. Crouch, Corio’s M.H.R. for the
first nine years of the Commonwealth, has
had little but ill-fortune since 1910, and
his luck has been more brutal than ever
this year. Thinking that Corangamite,
from which Gibson ousted him in 1931
after a hectic two years, would dis-
appear under the redistribution, the
veteran sought nomination for Ballarat.
Now Corangamite has been preserved,
and in the Ballarat plebiscite Crouch was
beaten hands down by W. J. McAdam,
who has been the local M.L.A.

anguished protes of H. E. Vail, con-

the protection of “crude-oil engine and
other high-class machinery which is not,
and cannot be, satisfactorily manufac-
tured in Australia. ’
This Practically defeats our intention
of expanding our operations and to a great
extent destroys the confidence of overseas
investors.
Events have made Mr. Vail’s wail ridi-
culous. Nevertheless the secessionists
included it in their “Case.”
One result of handing over Govern-
ment responsibility to irresponsible com-
missions and committees is a tendency to
apologise for Government policy. Both
the Grants Commission and the com-
mittee appointed to reply to the West-
ralian separatists conceived it to be their
duty to apologise for the protective inci-
dence of the tariff. “It has not been
oppressive to the degree claimed,” the
committee protests; “it is not certain
that the injury outweighs the cash pay-
ments to the claimant States,” the com-
mission bleats. No excuses were neces-
sary. The claimant States share directly
and indirectly in the benefits of Protec-
tion. Without it S.A. would have no great
motor-body works, and W.A.’s hatdwood
industry would be small potatoes.
The verb from which Hitler's new title
Reichsfuhrer derives signifies all sorts of
action. Carrying, bringing, kicking-out,
dealing a blow, wearing a sword, keeping
books, leading a band, conducting a tour,
driving a car, handling an oar, complain-
ing, ruling, boasting, laying down the
law, importing and exporting all need
fuhren to complete the idiom. Old-
fashioned Junkers, not used to being
governed by Austrian house-painters, will
be shaking their heads this week and say-
ing “Reichsleader, indeed! What are we
coming to?”
Canberra is tardily adopting the sug-
gestion that special native Courts be
created to deal with Binghi at the scene
of his crimes. Australia is the only
British country with a native population
which has no district-officer system ; but
it won’t work if it is placed in the hands
of anthropologists and missionaries. The
ideal D.O. is a man with the constitution
of a tree baboon, the temper of an angel,
the patience of Job and the cunning and
sense of humor of a schoolboy. Persons
who think in terms of ’ologies or western
morals don’t usually possess those attri-
butes.
Some of the candidates for the Com-
monwealth elections are already making
much of their qualifications. None seems
to be so completely equipped as an
American gentleman recently elected to
the Kansas Legislature. Waving a huge
bundle of documents whenever he
appeared on a platform, he cried: “I
swear that my discharge from the mad-
house was an honorable one, and here
are the papers to prove it. Can my
opponent truthfully say the same?” He
swept the polls.
From Melbourne “Argus” of 1854:
It is a very general and well-founded com-
plaint that all the departments of the public
oath of allegiance were Free Staters.
In terms of British currency imports
dropped from £23 11s. 4d. per head in
1927-28 to £6 15s. per head in 1931-32.
Now they are back to £9 per head, but
the trade balance (with gold) is
£38,000,000 sterling or £47,500,000 Aus-
tralian in our favor. Total imports,
£61,000,000 sterling, inclusive of gold,
show a drop of approximately
£86,000,000 since the year before the de-
pression. This is remarkable, but exports
are still a long way from their value in
1927-28 in sterling—£l3B,ooo,ooo, exclud-
ing gold.
Government home-building has been
a failure everywhere, except perhaps
where there has been a comparatively
small , outlay on wooden houses. One
reason, perhaps, is the nomadic habits
of Australians, which are the despair of
electoral registrars. S.A.’s experiment in
State housing has drifted into such a
condition that the flummoxed Govern-
ment set up a committee to ascertain the
facts and give advice. It reports that the
arrears of interest and principal amount
to £526,000, and recommends that the
State Bank board be authorised to per-
mit cancellation of contracts and con-
tinued occupation as tenants, at weekly
rates ranging from a peppercorn to 2s.

grade—gentlemen the principal business of
whose lives is to draw their salaries; the light-
est of whose thoughts it is to deserve them.
Things haven't changed much in 80 years.
Australia continues to lose population
of British descent, though, with the
exchange 25 p.c. in their favor, it ought
to be getting thousands of tourists a
month. While home-keeping Australians
were filling in forms for seven income-
tax departments, the Commonwealth
Statistician report that, during the first
six months of 1934, 24,475 persons
arrived and 29,168 departed, 5373 of the
arrivals and 7264 of the departures being
permanent. These items are related.
Taxes are driving Australians away and
preventing Britons from coming.
Dave McGrath, who succeeded Deakin
as M.H.R. for Ballarat, has gone to join
the great Alfred. Except in 1917, when
he was on war service, and again in 1931,
when, as a U.A.P. man, he saw his old
comrades routed, he always had to
struggle for his seat, and he was prepar-
ing for another stiff fight when he had
his seizure. In 1919 he was beaten by
one vote (Kerby 13,569, McGrath 13,568),
but' the election was upset and he got in
at the second attempt. He was a hot-
blooded man, and the strain of these con-
tests told.
With McGrath
gone, Gabb’s seat
wiped out, and Fen-
ton and Guy facing
heavy odds in Mari-
byrnong and Bass re-
spectively, Lyons may
be the only ex-Labor
survivor of the 1931
schism in the next
Parliament. With
Menzies looming up
as a rival, it is an un-
comfortable prospect.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Brigadier-General McNicoll, member
for Werriwa in the Reps., has got the
job he has long wanted —that of Admini-
strator of New Guinea. Though a politi-
cal appointment, it should prove a good
one. McNicoll has always been a
success —first as principal of Geelong
High School; next at the war (he left as
second in command of the 7th Bat-
talion in 1914, commanded the 6th at
the Landing and wound up a Brigadier
with a C. 8., C.M.G., D.S.O. and C. de
G.); then as boss of the Presbyterian
Ladies’ College at Goulburn (N.S.W.),
and finally as a politician. He is a dis-
ciplinarian, but he is appro ichable, and
the possessor of a sense of humor and
plenty of tact. He was 57 last May.
Rev. Dr. Robert Dey is Australia’s old-
est working journalist. He came to Aus-
tralia from Scotland in 1880 and for 11
years edited the “Australian Indepen-
dent.” In 1891 he bought the “Austra-
lian Christian World” (Dr. Fordyce was
chief at the time), and in 1894 he took
charge. He has been in the chair ever
since. Edinburgh and Montreal Unis,
gave him honorary D.D. degrees in 1923.
Donald Thomson, anthropologist on
the staff of Melb. Uni., is to be made an
honorary patrol officer by the Federal
Government for the duration of his stay
among the aborigines of Northern Aus-
tralia. This is expected to assist him in
his work by giving him a status, and it
won’t involve any extra duties. Thom-
son’s great work on the hero-cults of
the N.Q. tribes won him the Harbison-
Higinbotham scholarship at Melbourne
Uni. He lived for two years among the
N.Q. blacks in order to acquire the neces-
sary information, and his stay in North-
ern Australia may be longer still.
About a famous family:
Laurence Meynell, who is being entertained
in Sydney by the P.E.N. Club to-night, be-
longs to an English family which has turned
out a phenomenal number of writers and
artists. Alice Meynell, the poetess, who died
about 10 years ago, was a distinguished
member, and her sister, Lady Butler, painted
“The Roll Call” and other military story-
pictures. Alice Meynell married Wilfrid, author
of a life of Disraeli and editor of her works and
those of her friend Francis Thompson, the
poet. Viola Meynell, the poetess, is a daughter,
and Francis Meynell, poet and founder of the
Nonsuch Press, is a son. The Meynells come
of one of England’s oldest Catholic commoner
families.
They go to the N. S. Wales Bar at all
ages and from all sorts of places. S. C.
Taylor, who was called recently, is 37
and used to be in the office of the N.S.W.
Public Trustee. He has been actively
associated with the University Labor
Society, and in 1925 he recorded over
4000 primary votes as State Labor
nominee at Ryde. (His grandfather, Dan
Cassin, by the way, was a leading
Mudgee politician in the long ago.)
Taylor is a good amateur boxer, and was
formerly a playing member of the West-
ern Suburbs R.F.C.
The late Mrs. Septimus Harwood was
Sydney’s best known feminist pioneer
after the late Rose Scott, who was one of
her friends. Mrs. Harwood took her
B.A. at Sydney Uni. when she was 50,
and her M.A. in Melbourne a couple of
years later. The idea was to qualify her-
self for participation in public affairs.
She came to Australia originally with her
doctor-husband, and stayed on after his
death. She was 88 at her death, and
remained keenly interested in political
affairs to the last; but the present genera-
tion knew her best as a generous giver
to charity.
“Jeames”: The Duke of Brunswick,
who was mentioned in cables from Berlin
last week as “a possible successor to
Hindenburg,” may yet play a leading part
in the German drama. He is one of the
few ex-royalties whom the masses in Ger-
many respect. As reigning Duke of
Brunswick-Lunebourg he married the
Kaiser’s daughter Victoria Louise in
1913, and they are a model couple. He
was deposed after the war, and they have
lived since at Doom. His late father,
as a great-grandson of George HI., was
Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, but
he was deprived of the peerage in
1919. So both the Duke and his con-
sort have British blood in their veins,
and he is supposed to be persoAa grata
in English official circles. Nazi diplo-
macy aims at friendliness with England
since Germany must have some Power to
support its expansionist claims, and
France is naturally irreconcilable.
“Medic”:
Sir Douglas Shields, according to the cables,
“is entertaining Bradman at his country resi-
dence.” Shields has been one of London’s
leading society surgeons for a quarter of a cen-
tury. His hospital in Park Lane is the most
luxurious and expensive in England. He has
never forgotten that he was born in Melbourne
57 years ago, and he never misses a Test in
London or fails to make contact with the Test
cricketers. He spends all his leisure time at
the place in Buckinghamshire where Bradman
is recuperating, and which can be reached by
car, via the Edgcwarc-road, inside an hour
from Park Lane.
(1) Justice Napier, (2) Lieut.-Com. D. M cKenzie, (3) L. G. Macandie, (4) Lieut.-
Com. B. J. McGrath, (5) P. C. Spender.
Frith looked in at the Casey Commis-
sion last week and got the attached im-
pressions. The Commissioner, Justice
Napier, was born in Scotland, admitted
to the S. Aus. Bar in 1903 and raised to
the Supreme Court Bench in 1924.
G. Lionel Macandie is a Q. public
servant who has been secretary to the
Navy Board since May, 1914.
Percy Spender and Brian McGrath,
who represented the Casey family, are
members of the N. S. Wales Bar. Mc-
Grath was a commander-instructor in
the R.A.N. when he retired to practise
as a barrister.
Donald McKenzie is a lieut.-com-
rnander R.A.N. (ret.) who joined W. J.
Spruson, the Sydney patent-attorney,
this year. He declared last month, in
statements given to the “S. M. Herald, ’
Melbourne “Star” and other papers, that
the R.A.N. regulations are chaotic ; that
Admiralty practice is not followed by
the Navy Board, and that Casey was ir-
regularly discharged from the service. He
is one of the few Australian naval men
who served at the battle of Jutland.
“Second Divvy”: It says much for
Hindenburg's character the whole
secret of his fame —that even during the
war he stuck in the world's mind as a
symbol of manliness and solidity. The
worst professional denigrators could say
about him was that he drank; and,
as he was 87 when he died last week,
the story was probably a lie. In
August, 1914, his fellow-countrymen
thought little of his military capacity,
and he wasn’t recalled from his retire-
ment till the dash through Belgium had
proved a failure. He beat the Russians at
Tannenberg because a study of the
terrain had been his hobby ; he was a
failure on the Western Front. Luden-
dorff, Falkenhayn, Von Kluck and the
rest sank into obscurity, but Hindenburg
retained his prestige to the end. All who
knew him, and gave a frank record of
their impressions, have been in agreement
regarding his patriotism, his honesty, his
deep religious sentiments, and his
stupidity. “Beside him,” wrote a corre-
spondent of the “Gaulois,” “Hitler looked
like a monkey beside an elephant.”
A rolling stone that keeps on gathering
moss is Geoffrey Billing, whose latest is
the Ph.D. degree at London School of
Economics. He started at Adelaide, B.A.
and Education Department (1922); won
a travelling scholarship to England ; was
appointed to the Gordon Institute staff at
Geelong; and lifted successively a
W.E.A. lectureship in Tasmania, a lec-
tureship in Economics at Dunedin (M.L.)
and a Rockefeller fellowship. He was
doing research work at the London S. of
E. when he got his Ph.D.
“Exdig”: D. C. McGrath, the late
member for Ballarat, had a standing
which was all his own as Sar’-Majot
McGrath at Horseferry-road. It caused
one acting G.O.C. to comment irritably
on “the difficulty in knowing whether a
man is a soldier or a politician.” Though
in the A.I.F. Dave remained the Par-
liamentarian, ever ready to agitate
regarding the alleged wrongs of his con-
stituents —meaning all the other ranks.
He got along well with Brig.-General
Tom Griffiths, a monument of tact,
patience and commonsense, and, long be-
fore the institution of “the Billy Hughes
stunt,” his agitation had secured remedy
for some soldiers’ grievances. After 27
years as a Laborite, nine in Victorian
State politics, McGrath crossed the floor
with Lyons in 1931.
The oldest banker in Australia, if not
in the world, is Thomas Buckland, who
was 86 last month, and has been presi-
dent of the Bank of N. S. Wales since
1922. A native of Maidstone, Kent, he
reached Sydney in 1865, and started work
under his uncle, who was manager of
Daniel Cooper’s Market-street warehouse
at the time. Then he went in for station
properties, and by 1890 was rich and
ready to settle for the rest of his days
in his native land. Came the bank
smashes, and he had to get back to the
collar. He has been here ever since. He
has been on the board of the Bank of
N. S. Wales for 26 years and a member
of the Union Club for 38 years.
“Jeames” on an explorer:
F. Mitchell-Hedges, says London “Sunday
Chronicle’" “has made a dramatic come-back.
The paper called him “the champion of he-
men” and said he had “disappeared from public
life following a libel action.” I saw him under
cross-examination in this suit; one in which
the alleged goings-on of the principals sug-
gested the conduct of people in a thriller. A
collection of human heads shrunk to the size
of oranges was associated with the proceedings,
and witnesses appeared who claimed to have
been tied up and rushed about the country in
high-powered cars. Mitchell-Hedges told stories
about his adventures and achievements that
made De Rougemont’s seem reticent by con-
trast, but he fared badly in cross-examination.
The discoveries he claimed to have made were
in South America, and, according to the cables,
the British Museum is financing an expedition
to investigate another find which he says he
has made there. A dark, frowning, square-
jawed, well-built, middle-aged customer, with
a loud voice and a defiant manner, he looks
far more like an explorer than such men as
Stanley and John Forrest, whose bona fides
were never disputed.
“R.S.”: Albert Clerk, of the W.A.
Turf Club, weighed out, at 85, the other
day. Elected to the committee of the
W.A. Turf Club in 1897, he had been
clerk of scales for many years till a fall
put him out of action early in July. In
addition, he was Government auctioneer
and had presided over the sales of lost
property at Roe-street police yard for
donkey’s years. In his youth he had a
big reputation as an amateur rider.
Hume Dow, a son of D. M. Dow,
Australia’s Trade Commissioner in the
U.S.A., is proving a kind of cultural Brad-
man in America. In May last he got
an open scholarship available at Penn-
sylvania University (winning it in a
national competition in which character
and training were qualifications), and he
has surrendered that for a Harvard
scholarship. He secured the highest
honors in English and honors in history
at the entrance exam.
C. N. Hollinshed, who supplied the
burnt-out interior of His Majesty’s, Mel-
bourne, with its new lining, was respon-
sible for the Regent (Brisbane) and the
Comedy and Metro (Melbourne); also
for movie palaces in Masterton and
Palmerston North (M.L.). He was
articled to Long Powell, of Brisbane, in
1917, put in six months after the Armis-
tice at the London Architectural Asso-
ciation, and got experience of skyscrapers
in N. York as rep. of an English firm
of architects. He is a modernist with
an equal passion for curves and angles,
and a fondness for including Australian
materials in his specifications.

“It Happened One Night”
This blend of romance and farce at the
Plaza is the most entertaining confection
of its kind that Sydney has seen for a
long time. The plot is plausible, and
Claudette Colbert (shrew) and Clark
Gable (tamer) make a human pair. She
is the spoiled daughter of a plutocrat
(Walter Connolly) who disapproves of the
man she wants to marry. She jumps
overboard from the family yacht, and
rushes across America in a motor-’bus to
her beloved. Clark Gable, a reporter
with the usual epileptic editor, is a fellow-
passenger.
Their adventures on the trip, the
mutual hatreds with which they begin
and the slow burgeoning of love make
up the hilarious story. The action con-
sists of a series of unrelated episodes, all
more or less funny. At one stage Roscoe
Kearns, a pestiferous chatterer, notices
the resemblance between the heroine and
the girl whose father is offering 10,000
dollars to anyone who produces her.
Gable poses as a gangster who is kid-
napping her, and Kearns bolts in a panic.
There are scenes in which the young
people spend the night together (in all
innocence); a scene in which Miss Col-
bert reveals her impeccable legs ; a scene
in which the police are made fools of ; a
wedding scene of astonishing splendifer-
ousness and vulgarity. In short, some-
thing for everybody. The interest never
flags, if only because the settings change
every few minutes, and many of the set-
tings are strange, while a few are
beautiful.
“Sisters Under the Skin”
Frank Morgan —elderly, rich—takes up
with Elissa Landi, an indigent actress.
He gets so infatuated after a while that
he wants to divorce his wife. All the
inevitable things happen. Elissa falls in
love with a man of her own age. Morgan
finds that she never loved him; only
thought him “the nicest man she had ever
met.” Distracted, the old gentleman reels
to a telephone and dials his wife’s
number. “I—am —coming—home.” Fade-
out.
A feature of the film is the dignified
acting of the wife. There is an interest-
ing scene in which she and her rival dis-
cuss the husband. “You love someone
else,” she says as the girl is leaving.
“How do you know?” “You told me 50,”,,
says the worldly-wise woman with a
smile. Morgan alienates sympathy by his
silly behavior, but an infatuated oldster is
inevitably irritating rather than pathetic.
“Handy Andy”
Will Rogers is a small-town druggist
with a heart of gold and a wife (Peggy
Wood—she sings) with social aspirations.
She induces him to retire, but his plebeian
hobbies revolt her. An attempt to get
him interested in golf fails. She drags
him off to New Orleans for the Mardi
Gras, where he runs into a French drug-
gist and lady friend, and confides his
troubles. Says the Frenchman sagely,
“Your wife wants you to play. All right.
You play, and so hard that she’ll beg you
to stop.” Whereupon the light-hearted
Gauls (Conchita Montenegro is the female
of the species) fill William with cock-
tails, dress him up as Tarzan and take
him to the ball, where he stages an
Apache dance with Conchita at the
moment when his wife is about to give
a cultured exhibition with a gigolo.
William winds up in gaol for crowning
the gigolo with his club, after which peace
is restored to his life by the loss of his
money and a return to the drug business,
Jessie Pringle and Robert Taylor con-
tribute some love interest. The part fits
Rogers well, and the general effect is
mildly humorous. At Sydney Capitol.
“A Very Honorable Guy”
Joe E. Brown, as a simple-minded young
gentleman who lives on his luck in pool-
rooms, finds himself at the end of a long
stretch of bad luck in debt to a gangster
(Alan Dinehart). Now, Brown prides
himself on his honesty. So he sells his
remarkably-shaped cranium to the emi-
nent Dr. Snitzer (Robert Barrat) for
1000 dollars: 30 days from date of pay-
ment his dead body is to be delivered to
the physician. Gangster Dinehart agrees
to underwrite the bond. From that
moment Brown’s luck turns. He wins
a Calcutta Sweep, wins back his girl and
is about to get married when he re-
members Snitzer. But the girl (Alice
White) reveals that Snitzer was after her,
and that his agreement with Brown was
merely a subtle dodge to eliminate a
rival. Brown resolves to escape to South
America, but he reckons without Dine-
hart, who takes him and the girl for a
ride. Then Dinehart discovers that
Snitzer is a sufferer from bats in the bel-
fry, and the assassins are called oil'.
Of archaeological interest is the ap-
pearance of Irene Franklin in a comedy
mother role. She has peroxided her
scarlet hair, and her voice no longer has
the husky charm that captivated Austral-
asia 35 years ago.
“Stand Up and Cheer”
At the State. America decides to bluff
itself out of the depression, and a back
view of President Roosevelt appoints
Warner Baxter Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Public Amusement, with a hun-

“The Wandering Jew,” at Sydney Mayfair.
dred million dollars and a mission to
laugh the country “Out of the Red.”
This provides an excuse for a variety
show, which would have been much more
acceptable without the plot. The periodi-
cal switchbacks to Baxter struggling
against the efforts of Big Business to
wreck his plans, while Madge Evans, as
head of the Children’s Department, saves
the country by giving parties to ten or a
dozen children in her office, are irritating.
John Boles and Sylvia Froos are soul-
ful and songful, and Mitchell and Durant
and Stepin Fetchit provide some comedy ;
but the chief honors are shared by little
Shirley Temple and the talking penguin
(or is it a duck?).
“All Men Are Enemies”
Hugh Williams, an English architect,
meets Helen Twelvetrees in Capri, falls
in love with her and leaves her at the
outbreak of war. She returns to her
home in Austria. The war over, he
searches unsuccessfully for her in Vienna.
His father’s hope is that he will marry
his cousin, Mona Barrie. That’s Mona’s
idea also, and when Helen comes to Eng-
land to find him Mona conveys the im-
pression that she and Hugh are married.
So Helen goes away and Hugh is led to
the slaughter and spends a year or so
designing soap factories and meekly sub-
mitting to a wife who gets more objec-
tionable every day. The happy ending
doesn’t arrive till several Twelvetrees
close-ups have been endured.
Henry Stephenson, as Uncle Scrope, is
excellent; likewise Herbert Mundin as a
war-time batman.
“Melody in Spring”
A Prince Edward film. Although
Lanny Ross, a radio crooner, is the head-
liner, Charles Ruggles and Mary Boland
have most of the fat.
Ruggles is a manufacturer of dog-bis-
cuits who makes a hobby of souveniring
knobs from the beds of the departed
great. This lands him in many tight
corners from which the resourceful Miss
Boland rescues him.
He conducts a dog-biscuit hour over
the air and Ross offers his services.
Ruggles rebuffs him and goes to Switzer-
land, and Ross, who is smitten with
Ruggles’s daughter, follows. In attempt-
ing to steal a Swiss signpost, a silver cow-
bell and other articles Ruggles is gaoled,
and in getting him out Ross and the
daughter are gaoled, but the end is merry
and bright.
The film has many laughs, some catchy
songs and a number of pleasing scenic
shots. And there isn’t a ballet in it.
“The Trumpet Blows”
This one might have been better if
George Raft hadn’t portrayed the Mexi-
can bullfighter as a Bowery tough. On
the other hand, Adolphe Menjou, as
Raft’s elder brother, is almost too much
the gent, as a rancher who robs the rich
to help the poor in his spare moments.
He suspects that Raft is a coward at
heart, and there is a woman —Francis
Drake —to widen the breach between the
brothers.
Raft’s rise from a provincial novice to
an idol of the bullfight fans at Mexico
City is related in a series of exciting
episodes, and the love interest is kept
simmering by a tangle of misunderstand-
ings, self-denials and reconciliations.
The scenes in the ring have been cleverly
faked, and it takes a quick eye to tell
which is Raft and which the highly-
competent substitute who does the actual
lighting.
Sundry Shows.
“The Sacred Flame,” on its first-night
and first-in-Australia presentation at
Melb. Comedy, cannot be acclaimed as
a great play or even as a good example
of the art of Somerset Maugham. The
tendency towards a photographic natural-
ism in that playwright’s style is here car-
ried to almost as high a degree of per-
fection as in “The Letter,” and the result
evokes no more critical enthusiasm than
any similar piece of expert camerawork.
Any intelligent police or coroner’s
court reporter could have given as
graphic an account of the circumstances
surrounding the death of Maurice Tabret
the aviator, who, a year after his marriage
with Stella Tabret, broke his spine in a
crash and had been a chair-ridden in-
valid for seven years. Was it a case of
suicide or did his apparently devoted wife
help to hurry him off; or was the deed
done by his brother Colin, who has been
with her to the opera and who takes her
in his arms after everybody has gone to
bed at the end of the first act; or was
it the nurse, whose brooding silence
throughout is so consistently sinister?
These are among the speculations that
excite the theatregoer’s mind, but they
are precisely the same considerations as
would interest him if he read an account
of an actual case in the “Herald” as he
was speeding home from toil. A play
that tells us no more than a newspaper
report is not dramatic art, though it is
the beginnings of dramatic art.
Maugham is conscious of something
wrong with his work, and in the last act
he endeavors to make amends. He does
this by causing Maurice’s mother to con-
fess that it was she that gave her son
the lethal draught. She knew that her
invalid son could never again give his
wife love in the full sense of the
term, she was aware of and approved
the liaison between her second son and
her daughter-in-law, and she murdered
the cripple in order to spare him the
horror of the inevitable exposure. Fol-
lows a presentation, put into the mother’s
mouth, of Maugham’s views on the true
purpose of life and the nature of the
biological realities involved. They ap-
peared no more convincing when spoken
by the aged Mrs. Tabret than would a
write-up of the psychological aspects of
a crime by one of the bright young plati-
tudinists of “Truth.”
If the message of “The Sacred Flame”
had been inherent it would have been a
better play, but as it stands it was as
jolly as an oration in an undertaker’s
parlor or an inquest at the morgue.
Gerald Savory, Grace Lane and Harvey
Adams, who had just given Melbourne
the jovial “Fresh Fields,” struggled to
put warmth and color in their solemn
roles, and Jane Wood touched the nurse
to life here and there. The local Jack
Wiltshire had a watching brief as the
lover, and another amateur, Kathleen
Goodall, painted an extremely effective
picture of the suspected wife. But for
the most part the cast were fellow-
mourners with the audience at an artistic
funeral.

The original deed of settlement was
signed at the Pulteney Hotel, Sydney, on
October 24, 1834. So this financial Gib-
raltar, now second-oldest and second -
largest of the Australian banks, is about
to quietly celebrate its centenary ; times
are too hard and the outlook is not clear
enough to warrant a special distribution
to shareholders and staff.
The steady expansion of the business
from the start is reflected in the growth
of the capital account:

tCapital unchanged since 1928.
For close on the century activities were
confined to N. S. Wales and Queensland.
But with the absorption of its old friend
the Bank of Victoria early in 1927 the
C.B.S. gained a substantial Victorian
business, with small but growing connec-
tions in S. Aus. This gave both deposi-
tors and shareholders, especially those in
the Victorian institution, more and wider
protection. During the two months to
the end of January, 1927, the Vic. co.’s
£5-paid ords. rose in the market from
£9 4s. to £lO ss. and the £lO-paid prefs.
from £lB 4s. to £2O 10s. ; the price had
never been better since the smash of the
’nineties. Yet Mr. Langwould have people
believe that the C.B.S. first weakened and
then devoured the Bank of Victoria.
The contraction of earnings and the
drop in the div. since 1930 are common
features, of course. What is uncommon
is that last year’s net earnings exhibit a
stubbornness that has been overcome by
most other traders. Briefly, that is be-
cause returns from advances, some of
which now turn in nothing at all, and
from Consols, Treasury bills, call money,
etc., have contracted faster than the cost
of deposits and overhead generally.
After providing for contingencies, the
board wrote last year’s net profit £2346
short of the 1933 figure at a mere 2.8
p.c. on shareholders’ funds (capital and
reserves combined); that is about the
general level of banking profits in Aus-
tralia, which is lower than that for most
other countries in the world. On capital
alone it was 5.4 p.c. as against 5.7, 5.3,
9.3, 13.7 and 13.8 p.c. back to 1929. The
div. was kept at 5 p.c. Until recently,
only once (in 1893) has the C.B.S.’s yearly
distribution been lowered to 5 p.c. since
1848.
The market, which looks for no altera-
tion in the rate during the current term,
prices the £25 shares paid to £l2 10s.
(the other £l2 10s. is callable only in the
event of liquidation), and covered by £24
3s. 2d. in net tangibles, at £l6 14s. The
return at £l6 14s. is 3.7 p.c. on a 5 p.c.
div. basis.
Balance-sheet figures disclose a strong
banking position, as they always have
done:

Over two-thirds of the extra £3,557,570
of .deposits gathered during the year was
held in cash and low-interest-bearing
liquids. Advances increased by only
£1,119,750. According to the sworn

posits were 62.3 p.c. of total deposits
as against 64.8 p.c. a year earlier.
When the books closed, depositors and
others could see Bs. lOd. of every pound
coming to them in liquids, and the bank
was holding £5 Bs. lid. of the public’s
money for every pound of its own. Until
profitable employment can be found for
more of the funds, it all means low-
earning power.

The quick recovery of net earnings (up
£12,423 last year) is due to continued
improvement in the underwriting experi-
ence. This followed the co.’s withdrawal
from the unsatisfactory London marine
market a couple of years ago, and a
more rigid selection of risks, both of
which are reflected by an extraordinary
drop in the loss ratio:

During the last term there was a further
drop of £2652 in net premium income,
despite firmer values, bigger payrolls and
(he larger stocks of merchandise gener-
ally. But the management apparently
knew what it was about. Of each £lOO
of net premiums, losses made off with
£9 12s. less than in the previous term, or
£26 10s. less than they did three years ago.
Exes., of course, have not come back in
proportion to the shrinkage in net pre-
miums. Still, after setting aside £BOOO
for taxation, the surplus from last year’s
underwriting was £11,657 as against
losses of £778, £9408 and £32,953 for
the three preceding terms. Interest and
rents were practically unchanged at
£20,081, equal to 5 p.c. on capital.
The net profit from all sources was
thus 7.9 p.c. on capital as against 4.8,
3.8, a loss (£4053), and then profits of
9.9, 11.9, 12.6 and 15.2 p.c. back to 1927.
A couple of points were added to the div.,
making it 6 p.c., and it is doubtful
whether anything better need be looked
for for a while.
Over the twelvemonth the market
lengthened its bid for the pound shares
paid to 16s. from 18s. to 235. The re-
turn at 235. is 4.1 p.c. on the basis of last
year’s distribution, and the cover 245. 7d.
per share in net tangibles.
When the books closed policy-holders
could see net tangibles equal to 267 p.c.
of the year’s net premiums, whereas 150
p.c. is usually considered adequate:

Though the complications which slump
and recent legislation have created have
sent more business into the hands of the
trustee cos., they have added greatly to
the work, and therefore the expense, of
administering estates. Also, corpus and
other commission earnings and interest
and rents have all contracted, while
charges have remained unaltered. Hence
the shrinkage in net earnings and the
drop in the div., which, after remaining
steady at 14 p.c. for seven years to the
middle of 1930, was lowered to 9 p.c. and
then 6 p.c.
During the last term the revival in
real estate and other markets helped com-
mission earnings, and there was a net
growth of £833,432 (£333,249 in the pre-
vious year) in the volume of new busi-
ness put on the books: —

Gross earnings sprang £2780, and exes,
took £2320 of the increase. The net
result was £1460 better (no allowance was
made for taxation) at 8.1 p.c. on capital
as against 6.1, 11.4, 16, 17.9 and 19 p.c.
back to 1928. The div. was kept at 6
p.c., equal to approximately 3 p.c. on
total funds (capital and reserves com-
bined). Since the growth in the volume
of trust business can be expected to con-
tinue, prospects of a lift in the div. are
encouraging.
At June 30, shareholders’ funds were
invested in freehold, etc., £120,600 (down
£200); mortgages, £22,067 (down £133);
Government securities, £129,502 (up
£1727); book debts, £3721 (up £63);
cash, £8430 (up £1485). There was
nothing coming to creditors.
There are 160,000 shares of £2 10s.
each —60,000 paid to 30s. and the rest to
10s. On the market the latter fetch 18s.
and the former 51s. At these prices the
return is 3.4 p.c. and 3.5 p.c. respectively
on a 6 p.c. div. basis. The net tangible
cover is 395. 7d. per pound of paid
capital.

This solidly-established stock and
station agency and wool- and produce-
broking concern has a gilded record.
During the 22 years to the close of
accounts in 1929, divs. averaged 10|- p.c.,
sweetened with £235,000 of bonus scrip,
which lifted paid capital to £290,000.
Then came the big break in the markets,
the div. was lowered, to 7y p.c., and the
bestowal of gifts ceased. Still, it is such
a snug business, financially and other-
wise, that the pound shares fetch 425. 6d.
in the market as against 255. three years
ago. At 425. the return on a p.c. div.
basis is 3.5 p.c., with prospects. The
cover is 28s. 6d. in net tangibles.
Owing to a lighter clip, the co. put
only 108,525 bales (down 20,926) under
the hammer last year. But the Sydney
average was over £9 better at £2O 6s. Bd.
a bale, and sheep values remained at a
very remunerative level; cattle prices
were disappointing, and 5 p.c. was
knocked off warehousing charges, mak-
ing the cut 15 p.c. over the last couple
of years. Gross earnings from trading
(£104,113) sprang £12,198, while interest
(£8577) shrank £1313, and exes. (£78,428,
including £12,000 reserved for taxation)
were £826 lighter, leaving the net result
£11,711 better at 11.8 p.c. on capital as
against 7.7, 7.8, 8, 8.4, 20.9 and 19.3 p.c.
back to 1928. The div. was kept at 74
p.c.
How stoutly ribbed the co. is the next
comparison of balance-sheet figures
shows:

To carry an extra £62,303 of advances
(they are mainly against current produc-
tion), knock £12,591 off the amount com-
ing to sundry creditors and add £47,086
to the holding of Consols (£102,549), the
co. went to the bankers for £26,899, and
drew upon cash (£150,000) for £32,300.
The more or less liquid surplus improved
£12,999, reaching £281,625, or 19s. sd.
per share. The co. could return more
than half its capital without seriously
interfering with its earning capacity or
its financial position.
As for the coming season, prospects
are for a heavier clip ; doubt is as to
what the price will be. If Germany in-
tends to mix no more than 10 p.c. vistra
(a fibre made from beechwood) in her
fabrics, her demand for wool may not
suffer greatly on this account. Whether
Italy will be able to wholly carry out her
decision in respect of Australian pur-
chases without losing much of the foreign
trade in woollens which she has recently
built up remains to be seen.

It was the Chev. car agency that put
this 26-year-old firm upon its feet. To
avoid restriction of agency rights, the
business (in 1926) was split into half a
dozen subsidiaries, which, owing to the
vicissitudes of the trade, have since put
up the shutters, without any apparent loss
to the parent. When the agency for
General Motors was relinquished in 1930,
the co. took over the distribution of
Morris products, and has since added
Electrice refrigeration, Hollingsworth
radios and, last year, Nash cars to its
list of agencies.
For many years the co. had put by
more than it distributed (shareholders
have averaged approximately 10 p.c. since
the beginning), and as money became
available from the liquidations it was
largely invested in Government and other
Stock Exchange securities. Working
capital in excess of trade requirements
was thus accumulated ; so 10s. per share
(£78,240) was returned during the 1933
term, leaving reserves piled over twice as
high as the remaining capital, upon which
prospects of satisfactory returns were
therefore enhanced.
Last year there was a marked revival
in the car trade, and all the other
agencies contributed to the pool, too.
The spring in gross earnings (£63,880)
was £23,230, and exes. (£53,757, excluding
a net reduction of £1249 in the tax re-
serve) took £19,906 of the increase. The
net result was £3324 better at 12.9 p.c.
on capital as against 8.6, 6.2, 10.2, 12.9,
16.6, 24.2 and 35.4 p.c. back to 1927.
The div. was kept at 8 p.c., which calls
for only 2.5 p.c. on total funds (capital
and reserves combined); actually the net
result was a trifle over 4 p.c. on these
funds, which suggests that competition
has kept margins very fine.
The year’s better trading is again re-
flected in balance-sheet movements:

To carry a further £5703 of stocks and
£22,777 more debtors’ balances, etc. —the
etcetera consists of £20,045 of Govern-
ment and an unspecified amount of
other securities —the co. went out-
side for an extra £6477. Advances
in anticipation of return of capital re-
duced the holding in subsidiaries by
£14,827. The more or less liquid surplus
(£186,767) was £2509 stronger than at the
previous balance.
The pound shares, covered by 635. 3d.
in net tangibles, seldom come on to the
market. Buyers offer 31s. 6d., at which
figure the return would be 5 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis.

During the seven fat years to the middle
of 1928 this co. —it amalgamated the old
businesses of Cheadle, Crase and Co.
and Bennett and Fisher in 1919 —added
over half a million to the book value of
advances. To do this it leant upon out-
siders for an extra £154,499, and gath-
ered £361,630 of fresh capital, making
the total £600,000, for which the sup-
port, visible and otherwise, was thin.
Then came the break in the markets
and in earning power, etc., and payments
to the prefs. (150,000 A’s and a like
number of B’s which used to carry
a cumulative 74 p.c.) had fallen £54,375
behind at the end of 1932. A year or so
ago it was decided to wipe the arrears
by four annual payments (£13,594 each)

The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney
Limited
(With which is amalgamated THE BANK OF VICTORIA, LIMITED).
Extracts from the Address delivered by Mr. James Ashton, the Chairman of tho
Board of Directors, at the Ordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders held on ihc
31st July, 1934.
At a time when the economic situation in
Australia was gravest, a general agreement was
arrived at with the object of warding off what
looked like impending disaster. One of the
main aims was to reduce the burdens in the
shape of interest payable upon funds employed
in all forms of production and industry. Your
Directors have never lost sight of the obligation
imposed upon them, and, from the standpoint
of the general community, the need for giving
effect to it. So far little has been said on the
subject from the Bank’s point of view. The
present seems an appropriate time to put the
public in possession of information as to what
this Bank has done during the recent years of
stress. During the period of heavy Govern-
ment borrowing, when Government loans were
floated at an interest rate of 6 per cent, per
annum free of State income tax, correspond-
ingly high rates had to be paid by the Bank
if it were to retain its fixed deposits and so
maintain the volume of funds from which come
a large proportion of the money employed
in all forms of industry. The Bank overdraft
rate at that time was about per cent. By
a series of steps taken as early as circumstances
permitted, the rate has been reduced to a maxi-
mum of 5 per cent, per annum, the lowest
trading bank maximum rate, I am informed,
recorded in the history of Australia. These
reductions, based upon the total of current
advances, now represent an aggregate of about
£850.000 per annum. They have been made j
possible by drastic measures which may be !
shortly stated as follows:
(n) The dividend rate has been reduced from j
10 per cent, (last paid in July, 1930) to
5 per cent. This represents a sum of
£236,950 per annum.
( b ) Fixed deposit rates have been reduced
from 5| per cent, to 2£ per cent, for
24 months deposits, and from to 2
per cent, for three months deposits, with
proportionate reductions for intermediate
periods. The Bank, however, will not
receive the full benefit of these reduc-
tions until April, 1936. It is worthy
of note that during the initial stages of
this movement Government securities
were procurable at prices showing yields
of up to 8 per cent.
(c) Directors’ fees and Staff salaries were
reduced by 10 per cent., and the number
of officers and other employees by 12
per cent.
These concessions made by the Bank to its
borrowers, with the exception of Federal and
State taxation remissions, have been made, as
appears above, at the expense of:
(a) Shareholders,
( b ) Fixed depositors,
(c) Internal economies.
As against these concessions to its borrowers,
the taxation relief received by the Bank from
Parliament, comparing the year ended June,
1931, with the year ended June, 1934, amounts
to about £20,000.
The reductions in overdraft rates set out
above were made in a period during which
earnings were reduced by:
(1) the reduction to 4 per cent, of the rate
of interest on our holdings of Common-
wealth and State Government Stocks;
(2) the reduction to 2\ per cent, in the rate
for discounting Commonwealth Treasury
Bills;
(3) the very heavy fall in the rates earned
by our funds employed in the London
discount market, viz.: from over 5 per
cent, in the last quarter of 1931 to less
than 1 per cent, at present.
So far as shareholders’ interests are con-
cerned, it is not difficult to understand why,
under these circumstances, the profits for the
year amounted to only £256,731 ss. 2d., and
the extent to which they have been affected
may be gathered from the single fact that the
rate of return for the year just closed was only
about 2.8 per cent, on shareholders’ funds.
Comparisons have from time to time bee
made in various quarters between the Bah
overdraft rate of 5 per cent, and the rate o
4J- per cent, charged on fixed mortgages. Com
paring the overdraft rate with the rate o
mortgages by other lending institutions, atten
tion must be drawn to some points of differ
ence in the conditions between the two classe
of loans. In the case of a fixed mortgage loar
interest is paid on the full amount of the loa
from the date it is granted until maturity. In th
case of a bank overdraft, interest is paid on th
daily balance only. This follows the method
of Scottish bankers, which do not prevail i
the United States. Banking accommodatio
in the latter country is afforded by way c
loans of fixed amounts for varying period*
usually of short duration, and interest is pai
on the whole amount for the full period of th
loan whether the customer fully employs th
funds borrowed or leaves portion at credit c
his current account. This applies to a grer
extent in the City of London also Th
expenses attaching to overdraft advances unde
our Australian banking system are enormousl
greater than those incidental to fixed loans.
Loans by financial institutions other than banks
are made from comparatively few centres. The
nine trading banks doing business in Australia i
to-day have no less than 2304 branches and '
674 receiving offices. Overdrafts arc obtainable
at all branches. The operations on bank over-
draft accounts are practically unceasing, involv-
ing a multiplicity of detailed work of enor-
mous volume. In many cases the bank pass-
book is the customer's main book of account,
and a large amount of clerical labor is employed
by banks in keeping these books. The lender
of money on fixed mortgage is almost entirely
exempted from this burden. It requires little :
imagination to visualise the difference in the
expense rates of the two classes of business.
To make a true comparison between a bank
overdraft rate and a fixed mortgage rate, it is
necessary to separate the overdraft charge into
two parts—one which may be called a true
interest charge, the other a charge for valuable
service rendered, firstly by providing thousands
of smqll centres with banking facilities, .and
secondly by allowing daily operations un-
limited in number on each individual’s account.
Furthermore, a most important difference
between a fixed mortgage rate charged by an
insurance company and a bank overdraft rate
is that the former, - working on an actuarial
basis, can estimate fairly precisely what the
demands on it will be during any year, and
can consequently keep its funds fully invested.
A bank, on the other hand, in order to be
ready to meet any sudden and unexpected
demand, is forced to keep a large percentage
of its funds entirely uninvested, or in q liquid
form on which the return is almost negligible.
Many people visualise our Banks as pluto-
cratic institutions. Nothing, of course, could
be farther from the truth, as will be gathered
by a reference to the New South Wales Statis-
tical Register for 1932-33. This shows that
in this State 49,335 out of 98,042 fixed deposits
do not exceed £2OO, whilst of current deposits
85 per cent, do not exceed that amount. Of
a grand total of 298,152 deposits, 295,946 are
under £4OOO, representing 68 per cent, of all
the deposits. Dealing with this Bank’s Capital,
it’may be stated that the per capita holdings
average £7OO. Corresponding figures for the
whole of Australia are unobtainable. There
are other figures bearing on the same subject,
however. The number of life-insurance policies
current in the Commonwealth is nearly 2\
millions, whilst the last official records avail-
able on the subject disclose that for every
thousand of the population of the Common-
wealth there are no less than 793 savings-bank
accounts, in all over 5 million accounts. What
these figures conclusively demonstrate is that,
instead of being monopolistic monsters, as
many people* portray them, the Australian
Banks and other “big financial institutions’’ are
merely intermediary agencies which permit of
the mobilisation of small sums of money be-
longing to a vast proportion of the Australian
people in order that they may be lent to other
Australians wherewith to carry on the trade
and industry of the country. The extraordinary
convenience to the community at large that
such an arrangement represents should be
obvious to everyone who takes the trouble to
become acquainted with the facts. A con-
sideration of these figures also points to the
conclusion that the number of persons who
lend money must be enormously in excess of
the number of borrowers.
Turning now to the Report and Statements
of Account, copies of which are in your hands,
and which I am hopeful you will find satis-
factory, I shall compare the principal items
with those of last year.
On the liabilities side, no alteration has taken
place in Paid-up Capital and Reserve Fund,
which total £9,039,000. Bills in Circulation
are greater by £196,000, and Deposits and
Other Liabilities have increased from
£45,071,000 to £48,629,000.
On the assets side, Coin, Bullion, Australian
Notes and Cash at Bankers, at £7,697,000,
show an expansion of £1,013,000. Money at
Short Call is down by £lBO,OOO, but Short-
dated British Treasury Bills, which did not
appear last year, stand at £315,000. Short-
dated Treasury Bills of the Commonwealth of
Australia have increased from £3,640,000 to
£4,325,000. British and Australian Govern-
ment Stocks and Other Securities at £5,654,000
are lower by £183,000. Bills Receivable in
London and Remittances in Transit at
£2,070,000, and Notes and Bills of Other Banks
at £979,000, both show expansion.
Our Liquid Assets aggregate £22,001,000, and
exceed Bs. . 9d. in the £ of our liabilities to
the public.
The item Bills Discounted and other Debts
due to the Bank at £35,888,000 compares with
£34,768,000 last year, and Bank Premises, Fur-
niture, etc., appearing at £1,269,000 reflects
the appropriation of £20,000 of the year’s
profits to this account.
The Balance-sheet total has increased from
£55,406,000 to £59,160,000.

from reserves. The pref. div. was low-
ered to 4 p.c„ with the right to another
1 p.c. when the ords. got up to 5 p.c.,
and the further right to advance with
the ords. beyond 5 p.c. to 1\ p.c., and
to share in future bonus issues, if any.
After providing for bad and doubtful
debts and other contingencies, the im-
provement in last year’s gross earnings
(£68,956) was £9053, thanks to the
spring in the price of wool and in sheep
and skin values. Including an extra
£5046 reserved for depreciation (£4927)
and the taxgatherer (£4500), exes.
(£56,149) took £6079 of the increase,
leaving the net result £2974 better at
£12,807, or £BO7 more than a full year’s
pref. requirements at 4 p.c. Actually
the prefs. received 8| p.c., of which 44
p.c. was in respect of arrears, leaving
£27,187 to come. That reduced the tan-
gible support for capital to £2507 at the
end of June—goodwill, not treated as an
asset herein, figures at £27,000.
Appearances are that the co. may
have a struggle to keep up the
minimum cumulative payments to the
prefs. (£12,000 p.a.), for a while,
at any rate. The market therefore
prices the A’s at 17s. 4d. and the
B’s at 16s. 6d., the return being 9.8 p.c.
and 10.3 p.c. respectively on an 8£ p.c.
div. basis, and 4.6 p.c. and 4.8 p.c. on a
4 p.c. distribution. The net tangible cover
(book value) is 80s. 4d. A’s and 60s. 4d.
B’s. The more speculative ords. are
priced at Bs. 4d.
Here is the position so far as balance-
sheet figures show it:

During the last term £27,331, as against
£50,964 in the previous one, was lopped
off the debt. To do this and pay £13,594
off arrears of pref. divs., the book value
of advances was reduced by £37,647. The
slip in the more or less liquid surplus
(£520,944) was £10,276.
Waihi G.M. Co., Ltd. (M.L.)
For the 12 months of 1933 Waihi
treated 224,689 short tons for a yield of
£538,581 in gold and silver (1932 figures
were 231,840 tons and £530,872). The
output includes 27,780 tons from the ad-
joining Grand Junction, which assayed
7.6dwt. gold and 2oz. 7dwt. silver, valued
at 365. lid. a ton, as against Waihi’s
6.3dwt. gold and 2oz. ldwt. silver, worth
30s. 7d.
The combined crushings averaged 31s.
2d. compared with 335. 6d. in 1932. Ex-
tractions (91.8 p.c.) are well above the
average of recent years. Interest con-
tributed £20,213, and power supplied by
the M.L. Government under the Hora
Hora hydro-electric purchase scheme
was valued at £11,156, bringing total-
income to £569,950, up £B9lO. But exes.
(£457,001) sprang £63,259, of which the
special export duty on gold accounts for
£42,258, and development for most of
the balance. Of the £112,951 that re-
mained, £5920 was struck off for deprecia-
tion, and two Is. divs. (together equal to
40 p.c. on capital) took £99,182, leaving
£7849, which lifted reserves to £500,084.
Ore won from arches and uncalculated
blocks totalled 225,087 tons. For the
first time in 10 years ore reserves
(327,847 tons, assaying 335. 3d.) show art
increase (6000 tons), thanks to the price
of the metal. The most promising de-
velopments occurred at the fifth (432 ft.)
and upper levels on the north branch of
the Martha lode. Large low-grade bodies
on Nos. 11 and 12 levels are receiving
attention.
At the end of December there was
£137,919 coming to outsiders. More or
less liquids totalled £524,262, of which
£461,486 was represented by British and
Dominion securities (at market value).
Mine, plant, stores, etc., figured at
£260,919 ; that includes the Hora Hora
hydro-electric works, for which the M.L.
Government has agreed to pay the co.
£212,500 in November next. The money
first fell due in 1931, but payment was
postponed by agreement, it may be
further deferred. Also,' the co. has
£146,207 invested in Puket Tin Dredg-
ing, Ltd., Siam, in which the London-
controlled Tronoh Mines, Ltd., holds a
one-third interest. The dredge is being
erected, and is expected to set in before
the end of this year.
Paid capital, doubled by the 1927
bonus issue, stands at £247,954 in ss.
shares. After reaching 375. a few months
ago, these are now priced at 325. 6d.
They are covered by surplus liquids with
a book value of 275., including the
£212,500 due by the Government.
The short-lived Granites boom died a
couple of years ago, following reports
that values were not likely to continue
below water level. Jim Hebbard, former
manager of Sulphide Corp., who also
inspected the field, said that there was
a large, well-defined ore-body traceable
for some distance and undoubtedly auri-
ferous ; and that a rich vein, which might
parallel the whole system, was enclosed
by auriferous schists, to the presence of
which he attached importance. When
Chapman’s Gold Mines, Ltd., gave up,
C. H. Chapman took over the leases and
some plant, and returned his vendor’s
shares to the co. Recently he got on
to some rich patches again, 30 tons of
ore from costeens yielding 588 oz. of
gold; from the leaders he expects at
least 2oz. per ton. Dr. Woolnough,
geological adviser to the Commonwealth
Government, is said to believe that the
field is worth more extensive investiga-
tion than it has yet received, though his
report on the area has not yet been pub-
lished. Now W H. Gepp is to investi-
gate the possibilities of the place on
behalf of English interests.

“Quidam”: The attempt to galvanise
reef-mining at Big Hill, Sunny Corner
(N.S.W.), has not produced much in the
way of results. The flat reef which
runs through the hill was never
anything but a patchy proposition,
ranging from unpayable to just-good-
enough. Though thousands of tons
have been raised and crushed in the
past for moderate profits (the venture
was abandoned when values gave out),
there is a large supply of stone left, and
since it all carries gold there is a fighting
chance that payable ore may yet be
struck. Still, a flat reef takes min-
ing. Local opinion is that the best ven-
ture would be the old Paddy Lackey
at Dark Corner. Well over £120,000 was
taken from it, and it was by no means
worked out when abandoned. With a
payable shoot over 800 ft. long, and good
ore left underfoot below 700 ft., the
Lackey would appear to be a far better
spec, than many now on the market. It
would mean a lot of capital, the old
workings being partly full of water; a
glance at the mullock heap is enough to
tell any miner that the workings are ex-
tensive. A quarter of a mile of the reef
to the north has never been tested below
50ft. or 60ft., and the reef in the Lackey
itself was no good till about 100 ft. down.
Blocks of payable stone have been
worked to water level all along the reef.

Western Deep Leads, the co. that is
wrestling with the Main Ridge lead, near
Rockley (N.S.W.), has done a lot of
prospecting with a certain amount of
success; blit the width of possibly pay-
able wash is not so good as was antici-
pated, and where the comparatively nar-
row gutter has been proved it is nothing
to grow excited about. However, if a
fair profit can be won from average stuff
there should be some nice lifts when'
extra-rich deposits are struck on bars
and bends. The prospectus prediction
that gold won during prospecting would
pay for operations has not thus far been
realised.

Jn B. 25/7/’34 there were a few re-
marks on the modesty of Lady Shenton

shares, fully paid up, and £15,000 in cash
for its interest in a resuscitated show at
Menzies. It now seems that the vendor
co. is willing to surrender 84,000 fully-
paids, conditionally on its being granted
“the right, within 18 months’ time, of
subscribing and paying for 86,400 shares
in Lady Shenton Gold Mines (1934) at

Almost-forgotten Bellevue, on the East
Murchison field (W.A.), is having its
praises sung by co. promoters. Stress is
laid on past gold production, which ran
into six figures, but no mention is made
of the fact that shareholders didn’t get
any of it. Owing to the refractory nature
of the ore, costs were high, and impover-
ishment at depth finally compelled the
London co. working the deposit to get
out. Whether the enhanced price of gold
will bndge the gap remains to be seen.

Drniing has commenced on Eraser’s,
Southern Cross (W.A.), and three succes-
sive reefs are expected to be stabbed fit
depths ranging from 500 ft. to 700 ft.
within the next month. The site of the
bore is about a stone’s-throw from the
cement-floored hut which Deeming
erected and occupied when working on
the property. Old hands reckon that, had
an ill-advised board not sold the mine

ment, extracted all the ore in sight

Great Boulder announces another
“most important development,” this time
in the northern workings at the 1800 ft.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Jay Gee”: “It looks like a wet ride
home for you, Dave,” said Sarah as
they gazed into the moist night. “My
oath,” answered Dave. “Coming over to-
morrow night to listen-in to the cricket?”
she queried casually. “Too right,” said
pave. As she listened to the beat-
ing rain upon the roof, a look of doubt
crept into her eyes. “Davie,” she said,
“won’t it be dreadful if it’s raining like
this at Leeds, too?” “7/ it’s rainin’ at
Leeds?’ ‘lf,’ you say? Cripes, Sarah,
if this rain ain’t general I’m no judge.”
* * * *
“The Missus”: Nature did a Maori-
land lawyer out of a job the other day.
Hori, a full-blooded Maori, went to the
boss and asked for a holiday, explaining
that there was going to be trouble in his
domestic affairs ; his wife, also of un-
diluted dark pedigree, had just had a
white baby. “That’s nothing,” said the
boss. “There’s a white ewe and a white
ram over there, and look at their lamb
—black.” Hori, quite satisfied, went back
to work.
"You’re home early from the court, Mrs. Murphy?”
They shoved me out for clappin’ when me ’usband got three munce.”
“Tidapa”: Whether the idea was
pinched from Australia I don’t know,
but U.S. telegraph cos. are now building
artificial nests among the wires to reduce
interruptions caused by feathered home-
makers. The idea was very successful
throughout N.S.W. last year ; it is now
being extended to other States. In the
U.S.A. there are other pests to deal
with. In puma-infested country the
poles must be copper-sheathed to pre-
vent the animals using them as whet-
stones, and in bear country to prevent
climbing. Hearing the wires humming,
caused by wind, Bruin's thoughts natur-
ally turn to bees’ nests and the possi-
bility of honey. In former years almost
daily interruptions were caused by bears
becoming entangled in the wires, break-
ing them in their efforts to extricate
themselves.
* . $ * *
“Flip-flight”: 1 watched a sea-eagle
soar on still wings, turning his head from
side to side as he searched. Several
times he tilted and dived with a hiss of
air through his wings. Mostly, with a
fountain of spray as he hit, he’d go from
sight and come up with a silver
bar glinting between his talons.
He flew over the reef when the
tide was out and where a small
lake teemed with fish. He dived,
hit with his usual splash of spray
and went from sight. It was a
week ago, and I'll swear he hasn’t
come up yet. A big Chinaman-
lish frequents that lake —a fellow
all glittering opal and green, and
over three feet long. I’ve seen
him basking near the surface.
That eagle must have seen the
same thing. He dived. Sb did
the fish. The eagle couldn't dis-
entangle his claws from the grip
he took. Something happened
down below—what, I don’t know.
But if ever I see that eagle rise again I’ll
send a collect wire to The Bulletin.
* * * *
“Wandana”: A bishop visiting an out-
back town in N.Q. went into the pub for
a meal. Corned beef was the only item
on the menu, and when the maid slapped
down his plate he diffidently inquired if
(here were any pickles about the premises.
Through the board partition he overheard
his query transmuted: “Say, there’s a
funny-looking bloke out there wants
pickles with his meat!” “Pickles?” came
the retort from the missus. “No, there
ain’t any. Does the ruddy cow think it’s
Christmas ?”
❖ ❖ :!: >|c
“Canmaroo”: Lately a rotten joke was
played on a young chap in a western
Queensland town. He had a ticket in a
big lottery. False friends inveigled him
into the billiard-room of the pub. Just
prior to the announcement of the win-
ning numbers the wireless was discon-
nected and the loudspeaker linked up to
the telephone. A voice announced our
friend as having taken first prize; the
victim’s number was repeated twice to
make sure, then his name and town.
With a wild yell he dashed down the
street to the shop that had sold him the
ticket and shouted “You’re on a thou-
sand ; I’ve won the £25,000!” Still going
strong, he shouted for all and sundry.
The publican, who was in the know,
advised him to wait a bit, as the number
might be wrong. Presently it all came
out. The shock nearly killed him.
* ❖ ■}•
“C. Coral”: Opinions vary as to the
origin of cocoanuts on the Barrier Reef
islands (B. 4/7/’34). I think that the
very useful nut was brought over
and planted by some of the migratory
canoe voyagers of centuries back. When
Bligh hoisted the flag on North Possession
Islands in 1792, he found a fine grove
of young cocoanuts. Chinese junks visited
the Torres Strait islands prior to Euro-
pean visitation, picking up and curing
their much-sought delicacy beche-de-
mer —and at one island the natives assert
that the Celestials chopped down all the
palms that were then carrying nuts
in order to procure the fruit, as they
were unable to climb the trees! There
are stumps of dozens of cut-down palms
still to be seen.
* :> * *
“Tharsheblows”: “Cachalot” speaks
with great authority on whales (B.
25/7/’34), but I witnessed a fight between
whales and killers at a distance of 50
“H’m; s'pose you've been playing strip poker again.”
yards from the deck of the North Coaster
Pulganbar on June 17, somewhere be-
tween Sydney and Byron Bay, quite in
keeping with the stories in the daily
papers of late. The whales leapt bodily
out of the water some 15 to 20 feet, then
fell back with tremendous crashes.
Further, they spouted the most genuine-
looking water I’ve ever seen, and fre-
quently made a whistling, roaring noise
quite distinct from the row made when
they beat the water with their tails.
“Bismark”: Puff-adders (B. 4/7/’34)
dropped out long ago in places where
tenders for digging post-holes are cut
really fine. In our N.S.W. district
wombats are used. They are held up
by their tails, and when they dig to the
required depth are taken to the next
hole. The hole is just the right size for
the post, and when a strainer has to be
put in two diggers are held side by side.
* ❖ *
“Lone Hawk”: A party-
in New Britain hired, be-
sides “boys,” native women
to use their heads in lug-
ging along the none-too-
light gear. At the end of
each day’s march the belles
were lined up and each was
given an issue of baccy. The
devoted ladies promptly
turned their wages over to
their hubbies, who had dis-
creetly lurked in the rear.
No wonder polygamy is
practised up north!
“C.F.A.”: Can any Aboliar explain
the means of communication by
which bullocks rush? A big mob may
be lying down, and then in an incredibly
short time goes mad. The movement
(as far as a shocked human brain
can gather) is simultaneous with every
beast. Seven years ago I was out at
Hoganthulla, in the Charleville (Q.) dis-
trict, when a mob rushed. The beasts
were peacefully settled in the yards for
the night, then all at once on their feet
and away. We found later that a mob
at Hourigah (an outstation) had stam-
peded at the same time. The places
were 12 miles apart, and it was not a
still night. Coincidence, communication
or prearrangement?
“Maluka”: In happier days, and with
money received for Abo. pars., it was
my weekly custom to tarry awhile in a
cool pub close to The Bulletin office.
Frost-beaded flagons enriched the charms
of an alluring Hebe, and —but why
dwell on what is past? In The Bul-
letin of 13/6 / ’34 was a par. by one
“Maluka.” Sight of my familiar name
recalled sad memories. Sad, for at the
moment I am out at Brock’s Creek
(North Aus.), 30 miles from the nearest
•town, seeking gold in a hill as destitute
as myself. Long absence from the Abo.
circle is partly to blame. But should
“Maluka” secundus, by way of penance,
disgorge part of the spoils, then will
absolution for his lapse be assured.
“Dai R.”: The squatter who told
“A.W.U.” (B. 18/7/’34) that a grass-
hopper diet is fatal to wild turkeys
was right. In Walgett (N.S.W.) and
other parts of the north-western plains
it was common during my kidhood for
boys to hail ’hopper plagues with delight,
owing to the ease with which they could
capture the wild turkeys then abounding.
The birds used to reel about the plains
like affluent bacchanals, tumbling fre-
quently and breathing stertorously. When
caught, the points of the ’hoppers’ limbs
could be plainly felt through the feathers
of the neck.
“Trevdee”: Mutton-birds are not the
only sea-fowls to be found far inland in
Victoria (B. 18/7/’34). There are any
number of seagulls around Lake Tyrrell,
200 miles from the ocean.
’** v
“Airline”: One result of the destruc-
tion of the prickly-pear that covered so
much of s.-w. Queensland is the virtual
starvation of bees that abounded wherever
the pear was thick. I take a hive occa-
sionally, but, where half a petrol-tin of
strained honey from one hive was quite
a common occurrence a few years ago,
nowadays the comb is so meagre that
it not worth the trouble involved in
gathering.
“Old Gira”: The Australian Museum
expedition which recently returned from
a long biological chase in the N.T. has
published a report which recalls old
memories. It mentions that the party
was astonished to find an old abo. “king”
who had learned to collect properly,
stuff birds, and preserve specimens as he
had been taught by a British Museum
collector 30 years before. He remem-
bered all his old lore and soon had other
abos. well trained. To me the interest-
ing part is that the teacher was gentle,
unassuming Wilfred Stalker, who came
to the Northern Division of British
New Guinea a couple of years later col-
lecting for his own hand. To keep him-
self, he took out a miner’s right and
pegged a claim on the Gira, collecting
as he found time from ’weight-chasing.
The Government officials of the time lent
him every assistance, and he accom-
panied several Government expeditions,
following MacGregor’s old rule of one
bird —or one bug, for that matter —for
the Government, and the next for him-
self. He left for England with his collec-
tion ; next I heard of him was that he
was chief naturalist in the elaborate
British expedition which, with Gurkha
troops as escort, was permitted by the
Dutch Government to attempt a survey
of the interior of Dutch New Guinea,
hitherto a no-man’s land. He was
drowned by the upsetting of a whaleboat
at the crossing of some western N.G.
river-bar.
THE NULLARBOR PLAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Across our land in long-by years,
Pegging exp|oratory claims,
Innumerable pioneers
Have writ imperishable names.
The relevance of some is dim,
You strive to see the point in vain.
Wherefore I lift my lid to him
Who christened the Nullarbor Plain.*
He might conceivably have known
His classic Horace through and
through—
A thing, I penitently own,
In Uni. days I failed to do.
Or was it just a single ode
That flashed that day into his brain,
Who aptest of all names bestowed
Upon our one Nullarbor Plain.
“Where never tree is livened by
The summer breeze” —you know the
rest, -
And get the aptness, passing by
From west to east or east to west.
What other name could summarise
Those stretches that no tree contain
Neath summery (or wintry) skies
Along the wide Nullarbor Plain.
No desert here. Some day, mayhap,
The saltbush and the bluebush scrub
May put the place upon the map
With flock and herd, with town and
pub.
1 may not speak as experts might,
I only saw it from the train,
Above the Great Australian Bight
The just-as-great Nullarbor Plain.
N.S.W.
PIPARDS.


“Sikkim”: Ann much interested in the
cabled yarn of a white citizen of Ran-
goon—nowadays about as close to the
savage wilds as Sydney Harbor—who
was attacked by four huge pythons at
once, yet managed to escape from them
with the help of his dog, subsequently
shooting three of them. It recalls an inci-
dent long ago in Assam, whither busi-
ness had taken me. My camp was visited
by a large red-headed Scotsman whom I
had avoided visiting. He was a tea-
planter, and his fellows had warned me
against him. However, he invited him-
self to dinner and tackled the whisky
most enthusiastically. At the end of the
second bottle he began a yarn of how
he and two friends were attacked in his
tea-plantation bungalow by four tigers.
By the time the four of them were
roaring at the door and his friends were
taking refuge in the rafters, I had to open
the third bottle. “Ah had only ma
double-barrel,” said Mac, “an’ twa car-
tridges. Ah flung open th’ door, an’ twa
o’ th’ brutes sprang at ma —Ah dropped
them wi’ a richt an’ left.” Mac reached
for the bottle here and took a hearty
swig. “But,” I said, “how’d you manage
the other two?” “Wi’ —hie—ma fishts,”
was the valiant reply as he drained the
bottle and slipped under the table.
* * * *
“A.W.U.”: “Eyass’s” story of the hen
who skittled the sparrow-hawk (B.
1,8/7/’34) reminds me of the wedge-
tailed eagle that revealed more gumption
when it desired an emu chicken. A cock
emu and 11 chickens were promenading
“Hey, would you blokes mind comm’ over and sayin' a few words to my
bullicks?”
along a rabbit fence —the chickens hunt-
ing for titbits, the old lad grandly sur-
veying the world but not the sky. When
the eagle nose-dived the chicks rushed
to the shelter of their parent’s legs, while
the said parent danced in effort to kiss
the stranger. The eagle then rose 100
yards to think up another stunt. When
it dropped again it flew low along the
fence for a little distance, chased by the
enraged emu. Then the eagle rose
sharply, wheeled and ’planed back to
take its time selecting a victim.
“Jobber”: Cats as snake-killers? A
family I knew had an old yellow cat who
averaged about three decent wrigglers
a week. He always made a job of the
snake, and then dragged it home to be
put at the back door in the nature of a
trophy. He was never bitten, and just
faded away in an honorable old age.
# * * *
“1.E.A.”: I act as a lawyer for a
Maoriland firm which lends money on
maize crops. m The usual procedure is
for the borrower to sign a bill of sale.
Henare had only a few acres and wanted
a small advance ; he felt he was worthy
of being trusted. “I no want to sign te
mortgage,” he protested. “If you don’t
take my face for my word —well, never
mind, eh?”
# * * *
“W.P.T.”: At Bombala (N.S.W.) two
parrots always fly about with a (lock of
sparrows. They eat the same food and
even mimic the spags, being always the
first to alight and the first to take
off again. No matter in which
direction the parrots fly the
sparrows follow.
“M.T.” : When last I spent holidays on
Penguin Island, W.A. (B. 18/7/’34), Sea-
forth McKenzie was uncrowned king.
Those days it was a very out-of-the-way
spot; holiday-makers reaching the main-
land opposite the island ran up a flag, or
by night swung a lantern. Mac would
row across or send someone else ; his
word was law. In a small cave he kept a
store stocked with groceries and sweets.
No one was ever in attendance
—you just helped yourself, and at the
end of your visit made up your own
account. The caves are no longer safe
for campers, but on the mainland there
is a settlement called Seaforth as a com-
pliment to McKenzie.
*<* * *
“Kariah”: A nasty legacy left by the
plague of spider-crabs which played the
dickens with Victorian fishermen last
year was a multitude of spawn. The
invaders themselves, coming from very
great depths, couldn’t live for long near
the coast, but their spawn, developing
under local conditions, is a grave menace
to fishing.
* * *
“Humo”: Notwithstanding prevalent
ideas to the contrary, two dissimilar
types of crocodile have been recently
dynamited in the same New Guinea river
by plantation shoot-boys. One, a 14-
footer, had a long, lean body, a long,
flat snout, and in the lower jaw two dog-
like teeth that fitted into and protruded
through two holes on the upper (and
movable) jaw immediately in front of the
nostrils. The other had a barrel-shaped
body, a massive rounded head and an
abbreviated semi-pointed snout like that
of a dog ; in this case it was the lower
jaw that moved. In it there were two
tusks that protruded, not through, but
on both sides of, the upper jaw. Though
this reptile was some three feet shorter
than the other, ten strong boys couldn’t
shift it; six boys carried the first with
ease.
“Top-rail”: Tell “Pack Saddle” (B.
18/7/’34) that the limestone dam on
Nararni Creek may still be seen 10 miles
the other side of Camooweal, and is as
solid as the day it was built 50 years ago
when Nararni was an outstation of Lake
Nash. As to Chinese being found on
N.Q. goldfields with ropes round their
necks, I defy “Pack Saddle” to give one
authenticated instance of lynch law on
any Australian mining field. There is no
case on record where the rope has been
resorted to by Australian miners.
* * *
“Wodao”: “Lanus’s” “goanna” (B.
27/6/’34) was the rare pine-cone lizard,
“I was too scared to sleep last night—the place is overrun with mice.”
sometimes called the shingle-back. It
feeds mostly on insects, and should never
be destroyed. Sporting a very blue
tongue, it hisses at intruders, and when
angry behaves in a rather terrifying
manner. Actually it is harmless. The
quaint creature is seldom seen.
* * *
“Poly”: Steering old Lizzie through
the mulga country in the Charleville (Q.)
district, I ran into a patch
made heavy by recent rain ;
round the bog I saw, or I
thought I saw, a track. We
took it, swinging through the
mulga in fine style. After
we’d gone about half a mile
the old girl became blocked
by the scrub. There was only
one thing to do: we backed
all the way out on our own
tracks. About a month later
Liz and I came back along
the same road. This time,
just before the bog, there was
a clear-cut road into the
scrub, rutted by many tyres.
I steered the old girl along it.
We came to the same im-
passable patch of scrub. We
backed out again. I’d been
caught in my own trap.
Other cars had followed my
first tracks ; with the double
journey (in and out) it didn’t
take many cars to form a
plain road. On my first trip
the trees on each side of the
track had been green and
vigorous. Now they were
dry, blasted and dying. After
I’d added my quota of hot
words the few remaining
leaves shivered and fell in dead heaps.
* # # *
“Beth-Rafa”: Ran across a bluey-
carrying genius the other day. Having
been a lithographer’s draughtsman in his
youth, he was able to sketch fairly well.
To multiply each portrait he drew it on
a piece of kerosene-tin, following the
lines with the point of a knife, and
scratching through the tin into the iron.
Then he rubbed a couple of drops of
mercury on the tin, with which it imme-
diately blended, leaving a mirror-like
surface ; the portrait stood out in black.
Printing ink applied next was rejected
by the mercury and accepted by the
exposed iron. Using the heel of his
thumb as a printing press, he could take
as many as 30 beautifully clear impres-
sions.

“De M.”: In Vic. there are many
remains of ancient volcanoes. Small
lakes have formed in old basins, some
being salt, like Lake Corangamite. Many
waterfowl fed there, there being plenty of
small shellfish among the water-weeds.
Swans, ducks and coots can be seen
drinking at fresh-water streams running
into the lake. Tower Hill, between Warr-
nambool and Port Fairy, is an old cone,
and becomes an island after heavy rains.
There are craters also in the hills ; one
large one, about 300 yards across and
about the same depth, has its steep sides
practically covered by broken lava. The
bottom quakes when one walks on it.
:{c :'fi $
“W’bone”: Bush ants’ nest sites (B.
18/7/’34)? N.S.W. varieties prefer the
bole of a kurrajong-tree, though, as in
“Airline’s” case, the box-tree isn’t
despised. It’s not insect larvae they’re
after, either ; a white, gluelike substance
which the tree exudes abundantly during
flowering time is the attraction. When
the flowers go the ants seem to suck this
substance from the bark.
❖ * * *
“W.P.T.”: A hungry fox has a very
keen scent. Have watched him moving
along a South Coast (N.S.W.) river-bank
sniffing the ground. Presently a stop is
made ; then digging starts. With any luck
that fox dines on young platypus. Baby
rabbits are located in similar manner,
but rabbit burrows are usually much
deeper than platypus nurseries.
“Bogaduck”: A flaw in the story of
the kookaburra which was hung in the
wire for six days (B. 25/7/’34) is that
the jackass never drinks. The one which
“Yarragundry” describes would have
taken a bath when released, no doubt.
Jack drinks with his skin and never
swallows a drop of water, a fact well
known to anybody who has ever kept
one as a pet. Funniest thing I ever saw
a Jack do happened on the Mt. Lofty
golf course (S.A.). This one, after en-
joying the showerbaths provided by the
greenkeepers, would fly on to the revolv-
ing sprinkler-arms after his bath and
enjoy a merry-go-round ride on it until
his feathers dried.
“Paiiwi”: “Jordan’s” reference to the
toheroa beihg practically confined to the
Ninety Mile Beach and Dargaville (M.L.)
is far off the bull’s-eye. Oreti Beach,
within five miles of Invercargill, the
seventh or eighth longest unbroken beach
in the world, is absolutely studded with
these large shellfish ; any energetic person
could fill a sugar-bag with them in no
time.

Warm ashes where the fires had burned away.
Into the wild they fled
Where never foot has trod,
Except the black man’s, timorously placed
• Lightly and swiftly on the treacherous sod,
Where no white man might pass except a black
man led;
Down gorges only seen by native eyes,
So dark and deep the adventuring sunbeam
dies
Before it plumbs the depths;
Where matted jungle holds the shaking ground
And fear dwells in the slim and shivering trees
Of that beneath —-the crafty crocodile,
Lurking in some black pool, or, loglike, grim,
Waiting ashore for what God sends to him;
The snake a-coil;
The deadly scrub tick in the strangled soil;
The stealthy stinging tree that drives men mad,
And lawyer vines criss-crossed in thickets
dim:
Eor ever melancholy, wild and sad,
The wild man’s sanctuary—but safe for him.
Yet they were “caught.” Oh! smile
Who know the jungle faithful —and how men
beguile!

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
DEALING WITH THE FLY.
“Sheepo”: “W.D.Mc.” (B. 4/7/’34),
advocating dipping for fly, is fortunate
in not having had a strike when depend-
ing on his expedient. Proprietary dips,
powder or liquid, invariably are of an
arsenic strength of 0.2 per cent., and,
although strong enough to destroy ticks
and lice, and possibly maggots, they will
not prevent strikes. Investigation by the
C.S.I.R. has proved that at least an
arsenic strength of 0.4 per cent, is essen-
tial to prevent strike.
The arsenic strength of jetting liquids
is about 0.7 per cent., and should ensure
against crutch strikes for a period. Yet it
doesn’t in abnormal times, and it is not
a certain safeguard ordinarily.
Dipping is of great value, carried out
thoroughly. It helps to keep the sheep
in health, does not harm the wool and
destroys vermin ; but the man who dips
six or eight months after shearing
and thinks his sheep are immune from
fly troubles for the rest of the year is in
for a shock should the pest appear in
force.
If dipping gave the results claimed
for it in warding off strike Queensland
graziers would be deeply interested. Not
one per cent, of them has a dip.
“Maggoty”: That “W.D.Mc.” (B.
4/7/”34) finds flies 40 miles in the bush
does not destroy the need of the fly-trap.
Snakes are found in the bush also, but
we still exterminate them around the
homesteads. It is the fly in the paddocks
that we should smite. The piece of meat
“W.D.Mc.” mentions as attracting mil-
lions could have been more profitably
employed inside a home-made trap.
Every fly continually propagates its
kind ; and the more destroyed, the fewer
maggots are deposited. All expedients
to prevent sheep being struck only make
the fly go further afield in search of a
suitable medium on which to hatch out
the maggots.
And why go to all the trouble and
expense of a dip when an arsenical pre-
paration can be administered by jetting?
Ninety per cent, of sheep struck get
blown around the hindquarters. Any-
way, dipping is out of the question for
the grower on the black soil plains with
paddocks up to 20,000 acres.
If it comes to jetting versus crutch-
ing, I plump for the latter. Remove the
portion of the fleece that attracts the fly,
and the rest is easy. The crutching will
pay for the labor.
“Alex.”: “Airline” (B. 25/7/’34) errs
in saying that timber is a source of
blowfly infection. The contrary is the
truth, for it is in trees that spiders build.
A 50ft. box-tree can accommodate about
60 spiders, each capable of eating 3y
flies weekly. My belief is that the great
increase of flies has been chiefly caused
by the destruction of the forests which
harbor the flies’ natural enemy. And
wilga-trees attract flies? Yes, they
may—to the fatal parlor. Maternity
wards don’t succeed in lions’ dens.
SUPERFINE SHEEP CLASSES.
“Sheepo”: The innovation of a super-
fine merino class at sheep shows should
be adhered to. A devil of a lot of mis-
understanding would have been cleared
up had the class been introduced a decade
or so ago.
The position in some districts is
chaotic. Scores of graziers maintain
that their little-better-than-medium wool
belongs to the fine class, and only by
country show committees adding the
additional class for the fleece sections
will understanding come as to what does
constitute a superfine, fine and medium
wool.
Some time ago I assisted in judging the
fleeces at a country show. .Some ex-
hibited in the fine-wool section were
little better than common 60’s, and in
the medium class were two 64’s fleeces.
Yet, if the owners of the broader-
woolled fleeces in the fine section had
been told their sheep were of the
medium type, they’d have torn the build-
ing down.
What is badly needed in all these
country competitions is a definite line as
to quality for each class. The superfine
to be 74’s or better, the fine 64’s-70’s, the
medium super 60’s and the strong wools
common 60’s. Most growers will not,
of course, be able to discriminate as to
which class their fleeces are suitable for,
but an expert steward or the judge could
allot each fleece.
HAND-FEEDING SHEEP.
“W.D.Mc.”: I support “Lion” (B.
4/7/’34) on hand-feeding sheep. My
worst experience of drought was in 1888
at Wagga. After using all our available
supplies of fodder I was falling kurrajong
and she-oak for nine months, and when
the rain did come we only had a rem-
nant of a fine flock left. Feeding before
the sheep fall away is the only road to
salvation.
In 1896 and ’97 I lambed down a
flock of ewes and marked and sold off
shears 86 p.c. of lambs by feeding prime
short oaten-hay at the rate of lib. per
head per day. The waggon, loaded with
hay, was driven in a large circle, and the
hay was spread thinly on the ground, with
the result that the ewes never got too far
away from the lambs. Every few days I
turned in a few head of young cattle to
clean up straw that the ewes left. Every
week we changed the paddock so that
the little bit of grass that was available
got a chance to sweeten.
Always we gave plenty of salt and sul-
phate of iron—l2lb. of sulphate to lewt.
of salt.
In another drought, faced with a hard
winter, I shore my ewes in March, with
the result that they reared a good per-
centage of lambs, while my neighbors
lost large numbers of sheep, although
they had more feed. After this experi-
ence, 1 have always shorn when threat-
ened with a lean winter. A heavy fleece
is a burden to weak sheep.
WOOL-SHED TYPES.
“Dead Finish”: The centre-board
woolroom type of shearing-shed that
“Murrawong” likes (B. 4/7/’34) is ex-
cellent and convenient, but an L shed
is just as effective and is a more econo-
mical job. The style “Murrawong” sug-
gests is satisfactory up to about eight
stands, but over that the shed becomes
a big barn. Five feet should be allowed
between stands (in some States it is com-
pulsory), and anything over eight stands
in the centre-board type of shed entails
a big area to be roofed and floored—
mostly waste room.
For clean handling of the wool it is
false economy to make the shearing-
board anything less than eight feet in
width. If “Murrawong's” picker-up
could not handle more than three
shearers on the board of an L shed, in
preference to altering the shed I’d sug-
gest a “speedball”—it would be much
cheaper. Of course, the machinery is
erected on the outer side of the board.
The shearer drags his sheep across the
board, and, after finishing it off, lets go
into chutes and letting-go pens that are
open to everyone’s inspection. This is
far better than a chute and lelting-go
pen under the catching pens.
Many things happen on a shearing-
board that are never detected until
viewed when counting out. I still favor
the so-called L type.
MERINO .SHEEP EMBARGO.
“Valerin”: A S’African grazier tells
me that Australia, for her own protection,
is acting wisely in retaining the embargo
on the export of merino sheep. In his
opinion, S’African breeders cannot main-
tain the standard of their flocks without
regular infusions of Australian blood.
He further holds that it will take 50
years of careful breeding before Africa
could attain the all-round excellence of
Australian wool.
This seems to settle the stock argu-
ment that, as possesses suffi-
cient Australian merinos to carry on
with, a little more export won’t do us
any harm.
POTASH AND SUNLIGHT.
“G. de V.”: It is time someone did
something about this “potash-for-sun-
light” fallacy, which seems to have lived
longer in Australia than in the mind of
its proponent, Sir A. D. Hall. All Sir
Daniel said, anyway, was that “somehow
potash seemed to function in much the
same way as sunlight.” This is surely
too indefinite to warrant “Kilkivan” (B.
18/7/’34) putting at the head of the list
of functions of this plant food “the re-
placement of sunlight.”
One need only imagine a plant grow-
ing in a soil loaded with potash, with no
sunshine, or, alternatively, a plant grow-
ing in a soil entirely devoid of potash, but
in a climate of unceasing sunshine, to
see the fallacy. The Queensland Sugar
Experiment Bureau makes its highest re-
commendation for potash in the northern
areas, where, under conditions of maxi-
mum sunshine, dressings of up to 6cwt.
per acre of potash give profitable in-
creases of cane. And ask any fertiliser
house to name the main ingredient in
its banana mixture. Surely these two
crops get enough sunlight without hav-
ing to apply it out of a bag.
The fact is that the limiting factor in
the value of potash, or of any other
plant food, is the ratio between the need
for it of the crop and the supply of it
in the soil. No amount of sunlight will
allow any crop to grow in a soil that is
entirely devoid of any one of the essen-
tial nutritive elements.
In certain soils, as far apart as Wol-
longbar on the N.S.W. North Coast and
Larpent in the Victorian western dis-
tricts, potash is proving itself to be the
limiting factor in the growth of grass.
It is likely that the N.S.W. soil gets
more than double the amount of sun-
shine that falls on the Victorian area.
Furthermore, other soils within a few
miles respectively of the two in ques-
tion show limited or no response to
potash.
A SODIUM CHLORATE WARNING.
“W.H.W.”: A word of advice on the
use of sodium chlorate solution to
destroy skeleton weed, etc., as recom-
mended in B. 11/7/’34.
Sodium chlorate is rich in oxygen, and
renders organic matter touched by it
highly inflammable. Clothing steeped
with it will ignite readily from a spark.
An instance is on record in which the
clothing of a sprayer became saturated
and dried out. Whilst the victim was
smoking a cigarette a spark set him on
fire.
When intimately mixed with organic
matter, sodium chlorate forms an ex-
plosive which is extremely sensitive to
friction and percussion. Under favoi-
able solar and atmospheric conditions
the contained water evaporates, and the
chlorate recrystallises in contact with
organic matter when the solution is used
as a spray.
By all means, use sodium chlorate
solutions for destroying weeds if the
law permits it, but be very careful.
THE LUCERNE HAY CROP.
“Lion” : From now onwards all estab-
lished paddocks should be cultivated.
First eat the paddock bare, but don’t
let the crown of the lucerne plant be
eaten. Cultivate to about Sin. at least,
from north to south, then from east to
west. During the final stage rig two
harrows behind the cultivator on a bar,
and thus save traversing the paddock a
third lime. The extra weight of the
harrows is offset by the second cultiva-
tion being, lighter than the first.
If pocket permits, top-dress after the
cultivation with lewt. or more of super.
As soon as the grass grows, to about 4in.
eat it down with stock as quickly as
possible.
By these methods practically a clean
crop can be taken off for the first cut, and
it will make excellent hay. The super,
will help all stock on the paddock to
thrive, and will provide a much heavier
cut also.
LARGE WHITES.
“lan Joinerson”: If “Whakatu’s” asser-
tion (B. 27/6/’34) that Large Whites arc
not the most popular breed on the Eng-
lish market is right, why do not the Eng-
lish themselves and experts all the world
over (including at least one Melbourne
curer, who has been at the business all
his life) know it?
In England premiums are granted for
the purchase of pure-bred boars, the
choice of breed being left to the pur-
chaser. For the last year for which I
have records (1928) the L.W, purchases
were 532, more than all other breeds
put together—Berks. 16, and Tamworths
nil.
In Scotland and Ireland premiums were
given for L.Ws. only.
Why have royal commissions and com-
mittees of inquiry all over the world
been unanimous in recommending the
L.W. as the best sire to improve the
local breeds for the English market,
the latest to do so being that of the
U.S.S.R.?
I have bred Tammy-Berk, crosses and
L.Ws. for years and discarded the former
because, though they brought about the
same prices at the same weights, the
L.Ws. invariably beat the T.-Bs. to that
weight, and were also less delicate to
wean.
If L.Ws. do not make good bacon be-
tween 1151 b. and 1401 b., why do the
Victorian curers give us as good prices
for them at those weights? I was at a
sale of over 500 last week, and L.Ws.
were as eagerly competed for between
those weights as any of the Tammy
crosses.
Of course, breed is not the only factor
in pig-farming. Selection within the
breed is equally important, and general
management more so.

THESE LAST FEW
YEARS
These last few years have, in a marked or lesser degree,
proved to all the wisdom of making some provision for the
future. All of us have experienced the unexpected financial
calls of everyday life, and, while it is impossible to gauge
accurately the needs of the future, it is possible to provide
for them.
A Savings Account costs nothing to open, and can be
opened nearly anywhere in Australia. With it and the regular
saving of money, however small the amounts, adequate pro-
vision for the unexpected calls will be made.

COLIC IN HORSES.
“F. 34”: Tell “Rich. J.” that it is un-
wise to let his colicky horse go in a
large stable, since rupture of the stomach
or knotting of the bowel—both fatal—
is liable to happen, so violently does the
prad throw himself about during the
spasms of pain. Put the halter on him
and lead him about when he shows dis-
tress. The exercise will help to relieve
the pain.
Colic is a symptom of all sorts of
abdominal troubles, each needing dif-
ferent treatment. If it is caused by a
drink of cold water when the horse was
heated, it arises from cramps of the
bowels, and loz. of chloral hydrate in
1 pint of water will give relief. If it is
due to stomach medicines, an injection
of four to six quarts of warm, soapy
water may help. If the hollow between
the hip and the ribs is swollen, the whole
belly distended and the pain continuous
it is due to accumulation of gas in the
bowels. Chloral hydrate is useful in this
case, too, but in very severe cases relief
can be given by using trocar and can-
nula. This should preferably be done
on the right side between the last rib and
the point of the hip, and the trocar
should not be allowed to remain too long
in the wound.
PACKING TOMATOES.
“Rene”: The main points to re-
member when packing tomatoes are:
Don’t place green and ripe fruit in
the one case.
Don’t place one fruit directly on top
of another, but keep them in the pockets
of the preceding layer.
Don’t stand, walk or sit on packed
cases.
Don’t pack immature green tomatoes ;
they will not ripen properly.
Don’t pack defaced, marked or dam-
aged tomatoes —they reduce the value of
the case.
Don’t use newspaper for lining ; plain
paper pays.
Don’t put large and small tomatoes in
the one case. It spoils the alignment and
the appearance of the pack.
DEALING WITH BAD BURROWS.
“F.L.8.”: When digging out rabbits is
not possible try these ideas on the offend-
ing burrow.
If rabbits are under a cluster of rocks
put a netting fence around them. If in
a deep burrow open up the entrances
for about three feet, and shove a length
of old netting as far up the burrow
as you can. Next cut a piece 2ft. square,
and let it into the floor and sides of the
burrow. Then fill it up tight. It is
seldom that rabbits will either get out
or open up the burrow again. If they
do burrow along the wire they will
strike the square.
The method is especially useful when
dealing with creek banks that one does
not want to make worse by digging. If
particular about the last rabbit, these
bad burrows can be ferreted out before
blocking. Poison can also be used before
blocking the burrow, but I have never
found it necessary if the job is done
properly.
The same method applied to tree
stumps or roots makes a lasting job.
KIKUYU.
“R.J.”: It is hardly fair of “Honi
Pikau” (B. 18/7/’34) to class Kikuyu as
an all-round inferior grass to the pasture
mixture containing paspalum, clover and
perennial rye, for it serves a different
purpose.
This mixture is eminently suitable to
dairymen, but a fairly fertile soil is
needed to get results. The chief danger
with paspalum in a mixture is a tendency
to go rank in heavy rainfall districts,
when it will smother out the clovers and
winter growers.
Kikuyu can only be grown from cut-
tings. It can be planted any time be-
tween spring and early autumn, and is
profitable in poor or sandy country over-
run with bracken.
I have seen remarkable results from
Kikuyu on land just burnt off which
formerly grew nothing but dense lantana.
It was sown in furrows 4ft. apart, the
roots being dropped every 2ft. Within
two years it had completely choked the
lantana, though the bush had to be
brushed once or twice in the early stages.
Kikuyu is most effective in checking
bracken, for its root system is tremen-
dously strong.
“Amber”: “Honi Pikau” (B. 18/7/’34)
seems to have a wrong conception of
Kikuyu, which is not a cool-season or
winter-growing grass, but is good for
districts where paspalum does well. It
has a flush- and a slack-growth period.
The best growth is under warm and
moist conditions, while the slack growth
is in cool seasons.
Kikuyu will remain green and succu-
lent longer than paspalum and with-
stand light frosts of up to five to seven
degrees, but more severe frosts (say, 10
degrees) will cut the grass back to its
roots. In districts with frost-free winter
climates, Kikuyu remains green all the
year.
Kikuyu grass is considered by some
as a good change from paspalum, or
even superior to it, in that its growth ex-
tends over a greater period of the year—
coming away in spring earlier and dying
off later. Like paspalum, also, Kikuyu
needs good management, and the flush
growth of late spring should be con-
verted into grass silage if the growth can-
not be then eaten down by stock.
The addition of perennial rye and
white clover in good soil and rainfall
districts and Wimmera rye and subter-
ranean clover in moderate rainfall and
soil areas would, of course, give an all-
year-round pasture.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Pick”: Do not throw away your
worn-out round tanks. Sections of them
make first-class coverings for fowl-
houses or dog-kennels. And horizontal
strips from them make a good rain-
proof join when fixing a shed lean-to
under the shingled roof of a barn or
hay-shed.
“N.W.J.H.”: In erecting a stake-and-
staple fence, when you have your two
strained posts firmly rammed and stayed,
stretch a wire (a few inches from the
ground) from one to the other of the
strained posts, and another wire from
the top in the same way. Then drive
in your stakes. The two wires give you
correct line without sighting, and the top
wire will give you even height.
“Jimmac”: This is a simple device to
save risk in sharpening scythes or hooks.
Get a piece of thick leather (or rubber
tyre) 6in. to Bin. square.; Through the
centre cut a hole an inch or so square.
Rivet one end of a short length of strap
to the leather beside the hole. Force
the end of the carborundum stone
through the hole, pull the strap tight
over the end of the stone and rivet it
to the leather on the other side of the
hole. The gadget acts like a sword-
hilt.
“Sirius”: A giant toad (Bufo marinus)
has been introduced into Hawaii from the
West Indies to try to clean up beetles
injurious to the sugar crop. The toad
is reported as having done great work
in Porto Rico, and first reports from
Hawaii are promising. Perhaps these
croakers will eventually be the solution
of the cane-grub problem in North
Queensland.
“Car C.”: A simpler method than
“M.H.R.’s” of keeping a cow’s tail out
of action during milking is to drive a
nail into the top rail of the bail about
a foot behind Strawberry and hitch the
tail tuft to it. The hair will hold until
she is milked. Be sure to unhitch it
before letting her go.
“A.G.T.”: To punch out washered-
type copper rivets, place the rivet-head
over a hole and punch the burr through
the washer with a nail-punch.
“Agricola”: After pruning, picking up
the cuttings is a long and tiresome job.
This season I put an old 400-gallon iron
tank on a tree-fork sledge, starting a fire
in it; dragged it with a horse between the
rows of trees, picking up the cuttings and
burning them. It took just half the time
to do 20 acres than by the old way, viz.,
carting them off.
“Gumblegubbin”: A cotton-reel makes
a good handle for a drawer and for small
doors. Saw one end off the reel and
fasten it on with a stout screw. Put a
small iron or brass washer between the
screw and the reel to keep the screw-

(B. 27/6/’34) in his criticism of “Dead
Finish” (B. 16/3/ ’34). In all my travels of
N.S.W. and Queensland I have not seen
a flock of sheep of 72 count averaging
121 b. of wool. A fleece of 81b. is con-
sidered an excellent average for a 72
count. I would like to hear the name of
the station that breeds such wonder
sheep.

SYDNEY HAS AN
IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO
HOLIDAY MAKERS.
Blue skies, a considerate sun, scintillating
ocean and harbor, clean, brilliant, safe
beaches call you now. Gorgeous gardens
and miles of orchards and farms in their spring
settings add to your pleasure. The Metropole is
in close juxtaposition to all these—as to all theatrical
and picture and other pleasure resorts. Sydney’s shops
with their displays are reached by tram. Winter Garden
with Orchestra. Terms from 6/6 per night (room only)
you will combine with economy the greatest comfort. Service is
not the slogan—it is the practice.

LEAVES FROM THE PAST.
Xll.— Coaching with Cobb and Co.
In these days of cricket coaches, golt
coaches, bridge coaches and Esperanto
coaches, we are apt to forget that there
was a time when real coaches coached to
and fro, and were as much a part of the
landscape as rabbits, dead stock, bush-
rangers’ huts and deserted diggings.
Actually, they didn’t belong to Mr.
Cobb at all, but his name was painted
on them, so no one was any the wisei.
Out to the west they raced ; up to the
north, and back from the south. in
fact, they ran in all directions, yet there
ware remarkably few collisions, as the
drivers were masters of their craft.
Drivers began as lads by holding
horses outside city hotels while the riders
popped in for a quick one. This called
for patience and endurance of the high-
est order. The 10-year apprenticeship
in hansom cabs which followed
sharpened their wits and perfected their
vocabulary, after which they worked
their way gradually through the various
stages of tandem, three of a kind, lull
hand, etc., until they reached the top of
the profession.
The final test was very severe. It en-
tailed driving 12 chestnuts up a narrow
street at a hand gallop and turning
a sharp corner without slackening speed
or upsetting a glass of whisky placed on
the back step, at the same time pointing
out to a passenger on the box-seat the
pub where Black George lowered 12
pints in 12 seconds flat.
Australian coaches were seldom
snowed up, but that’s about all that didn’t
happen to them. They were built up,
boosted up, polished up, held up, shot
up and, finally, broken up.
It is a mistake
to think that
coaches were
always being held
up. Sometimes a
coach would go
three or four days
without even see-
ing a bushranger.
On the other hand,
it might be held
up twice within a
few miles. This
was bad manage-
ment, and, pro-
vided the first gang
had done its work
properly, all the
second lot got for
its trouble would
be the coarse jeers
of the penniless
passengers. In ac-
cordance with cus-
tom, the driver
would get a bullet
or so through his
hat. On some
routes Cobb and
Co. used to pay
the drivers a special hat allowance.
Years afterwards you could always pick
out a Cobb man by his well-ventilated
hat.
The wonderful day’s run put up by
Whiskers Casey, driving nine prads and
a shafter between Ironbark and Boggy
Creek in 1862, has never been surpassed.
The following was his epic performance:
16 holdups, 14 breakdowns, 38 pick-me-
ups, 27 hat perforations and 17 m.p.h.
(mile posts hit), and even then he reached
Boggy Creek five minutes before closing-
time.
Everyone agrees that Romance went
out with the coaches ; except the flappers.
who consider it came in with the closed
car. Anyhow, Mr. Cobb isn’t worrying.

AN AWKWARD SITUATION.
“When the secretary of the Plumbers’ Union
arrived at his office yesterday he discovered that
his headquarters had been flooded.”
— “S. M. Herald.”.
It was some time before he could get
into the office, as he’d left his latchkey
home, and when he sent the office boy to
get it there was further delay, as the lad
had forgotten to bring his lunch and
called at his home to collect it en route.
The secretary decided to call in a
plumber to repair the roof, and instructed
the typist to bring him a list of financial
members. Unfortunately, she had for-
gotten to bring her typewriter, and by
the time she went back for it the water
had risen two feet. The ballot resulted
in the job being given to one Potfgers,
but when he arrived, complete with tools
and assistant, he was summarily ejected
from the office and the union. A second
ballot will be held at the next monthly
meeting, and in the meantime the secre-
tary is hoping that the fine spell will last.

MORE NEWS FROM ABERDEEN.
The Annual Bagpipes Competitions,
which were held last week, took place at
the request of the
business community
in the mountain
fastnesses 35 miles
from Aberdeen.
The day was a typi-
cally lovely Scottish
one. A heavy mist
limited visibility to
five feet, and a
swirling, icy sleet
lashed down at in-
tervals. At the end
of the contests wild
life within a radius
of two miles was
extinct and vegeta-
tion completely spoiled.
Pipe-Col. Donald Mcßoniknobs won
the endurance contest by blowing continu-
ously for Bhr. 35min., the only ill-effects
being an addled brain, the loss of three
front teeth and an expansion of the
chest of 44 inches. He followed up this
amazing effort by playing the simple
“Owre Cushat Croods wi’ Burnies
Haughs” in one breath.
The day was marred by an unfortunate
contretemps which occurred when Jamie
McWhacker, a disappointed contestant,
objecting to the umpire’s decision, lashed
out in the thick mist at what he thought
was the umpire, a small man with a
heavy beard, and broke his knuckles on
the sporran of a seven-foot Highlander.
Jamie will not be competing next year.

POLITICO-METEOROLOGICAL
FORECAST.
Very stormy conditions may be ex-
pected right up till mid-September,
accompanied by severe blasts of hot air
from the north, south, east and west, and
culminating in strong squalls in the
Bligh- and Goulburn-street districts. The
heavy frost which has been in evidence
in the Canberra area during the past few
years is expected to continue.
On September 15 there will be a
severe nation-wide drought, with ex-
tremely windy conditions prevailing in
scattered parts. There should be heavy
dues in many districts between 8 a.m. and
8 p.m. on that date, followed by a thick
fog, which should clear somewhat
towards midnight. A severe depression
may thereafter operate in various metro-
politan and country districts, while there
will be many “misseds.”

“You know, waiter,” said the new
diner, “that I am very particular about
the way my food is cooked. I want a
nice bit of steak and two eggs. The
steak must be fillet, mind you. I don't
want it too thick, but it mustn’t be thin
—about three-quarters of an inch thick.
1 don’t like it raw, but an overdone steak
is ruined. Just nicely red will do, with
a little bit of fat—not too much. About
the eggs—you’ve new-laid eggs, I sup-
pose? Well, two nice new-laid eggs. I
like the ones with the brownish shells.
Don’t fry them too much —just nicely
set; and see that they are not broken.”
“Yes, sir; certainly, sir,” said the
waiter politely. Liking his tone, the
“Do you know anything had about her?”
“No. What is it?”
diner watched him with a face full of
satisfaction as he departed.
“Steak and two eggs!” ordered the

HIS REPRESENTATIVE.
At school, Smart despised Mugg.
Smart was captain of all the sports teams.
Mugg refused to play anything but two-
up. While Smart won all the prizes for
lessons and Was generally popular,
Mugg, who was not liked by anyone,
was always at the foot of the class.
It was the same afterwards. In busi-
ness Smart was successful at everything
he touched. Mugg was a ne’er-do-well.
That’s why Smart is seeing red.
At the n6xt elections he has either to
vote for Mugg or help the party he

Information Sought.
(1) How many hops are there. in the cen-
tenary air race, and how long are they ? (2)
What advantages will Kingsford Smith have
over conditions when he made his record be-
tween London and Australia last year? (3)
What advantages over Hint, who broke that
record 2731.
(1) Five compulsory stops. First is Bagdad,
2553 miles from London; then there are hops
of 2300 miles to Allahabad, 2210 miles to
Singapore, 2084 miles to Darwin and 1389
miles to Charleville. The last stage, to Mel-
bourne, is 787 miles. \(2) On his flight of 7 days
4} hours in October, 1933, he flew solo, his
’plane being a Percival Gull with Gipsy
Major engine, and did the journey to Wyndham
in 10 stages. On his race flight he will have
a much faster ’plane, a Lockheed Affair,
credited with a top speed of 230 m.p.h.; a
variable pitch propeller which gives a very
quick take off; and the services of an assistant
pilot (Capt. P. G. Taylor). (3) Ulm’s record
was not comparable with Kingsford Smith’s, as
it was achieved in a multi-engined ’plane carry-
ing four persons. On the score of safety and
reliability, such a ’plane, so manned, is much
superior to any single-engined solo craft. But
Smith’s Affair is very much faster, and for
racing purposes two men are preferable to four.

(1) Are any figures available showing the
number of taxi-cabs in Sydney charging the
different rates per mile? (2) What is the
standard flag-fall charge? (3) Do company-
owned taxis charge less. than privately-owned
ones? (4) What has been done regarding the
suggestion that there should be a standard taxi
fare in Sydney ? —2780.
(1) At June 30, 1933, there were 403 taxi-
cabs operating at the maximum rate of Is. 6d.
per mile, 6 at Is. 4d. per mile, 17 at Is. 3d.,
569 at Is., and 31 at 9d. per mile. (2) One
shilling, additional to the mileage rate in each
case. (3) Practically all the taxi-cabs operated
by companies, trading societies and associations
were plying at the rate of Is. per mile. (4)
There has been no unanimity on the question
amongst operators, and no action has yet been
taken to fix a standard.
I have been informed that a patent in con-
nection with electric refrigerators is due to
expire either this year or next, and that there
will then be a large reduction in prices of the
various makes. Is this correct, or, at any rate,
probable ? —2627.
So far as can be ascertained in Australia,
there are no patents on refrigerators which are
likely to expire shortly, and in any case the
cost of production of the various models is
such that a substantial reduction in price is
extremely unlikely.
What does it cost the War Service Homes
Commission to administer each home p.a.?
—2748.
Commonwealth average is £2 3s. 4d. p.a.
Costs in various States are: W.A. (Workers’
Homes Board), £4 55.; S.A. (State Bank of
S.A.), £3 2s. 10d.; Tas. (Agricultural Bank of
Tas.), £3 10s. 4d.
(1) When and how were subjects of British
India given the right to vote at Federal elec-
tions? (2) Have British Indians in Australia
been admitted to the benefits of invalid and
old-age pensions and maternity allowances ?
—2781.
(1) In 1925, when sub-section (5) of section
39 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, 1918-24,
was amended by adding after the word “Asia”
the words “except British India.” (2) Yes.
Would two months’ residence in M.L. debar
me from receiving the old-age pension ? I
have lived in N. S. Wales 30 years, and that is
the only time I have been away.— 2747.
No. Under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions
Act, continuous residence is not deemed to
have been interrupted by occasional absences
not exceeding in the aggregate one-tenth ol the
total period of residence.
(1) Is it possible to secure a loan from the
War Service Homes Commission to buy or
erect a home ? (2) Are any War Service homes
in the Newcastle district that have been re-
possessed available for sale ? —2603.
(1) The commission has temporarily ceased
the granting of loans in respect of the purchase
of existing properties or erection of homes.
(2) Yes. Get in touch with the District Archi-
tect, War Service Homes Commission, Customs
House, Newcastle.
(1) What advantages are to be gained (apart
from limited liability ) by forming a business
carried on as a partnership into a limited lia-
bility co., with the partners holding all the
shares except .. five ? (2) Any disadvantages ?
(3) Are profits left in the business by the
partners in such a co. taxable ? (4) Do public
liability cos. pay Federal and State Tax on
total profits or only on profits distributed ?
(5) Do they pay special income tax ? —2651.
(1) and (2) Principal advantage is the limita-
tion of shareholders’ liability, whereas in a
partnership every partner is liable jointly with
his co-partners for all debts incurred. Other
advantages or disadvantages depend on the
nature of the business. The expense involved
in converting the partnership into a co. would
be considerable, and the matter of companies’
taxation should be taken into account. (3),
(4) and (5) Commonwealth: In addition to ordi-
nary taxation cos. are assessable on the whole
of their taxable income at the rate of Is. in
the £ (super tax), and a further tax of 6 p.c.
of the income is payable on any income from
property. Cos. receive no statutory exemp-
tions. Staie (N.S.W.): The rate is Is. 9d.
per £ where the taxable income does not
exceed £5OO, from £5Ol to £lOOO, Is. 10d., and
so on progressively till £4500 is reached, when
it becomes 2s. 6d. in the £.
Meaning of ‘‘Not Negotiable," sometimes
placed on cheques. Do these words, added to
crossing, give the drawer any additional pro-
tection ? —2670.
If “Not Negotiable” is written across the
cheque no person who takes it can obtain a
better title than that which the person from
whom he took it possessed. The drawer
secures himself from liability to a person who
innocently gave value for a stolen cheque. If
the cheque, is crossed only, the drawer is
liable in such a case.
(1) In grandfather clocks with Westminster
chimes, how often do the chimes operate, and
how many notes to each operation ? (2) Can
varieties in tones be obtained, and how is such
variety effected ? (3) Can adjustments be made
by the purchaser to produce a different tone to
the one given in a clock ? —2580.
(1) Westminster chimes pperate every 15
minutes. Four notes are sounded in the first
quarter, eight in the second, 12 in the
third, 16 in the fourth. (2) Tone varies accord-
ing to the octave in which the chimes are set.
Thin, short rods will give a high-pitched chime,
while stout, long rods produce deep, mellow
tones. (3) No.
Does Sydney Technical College conduct a
course in radio engineering ? —2789.
Yes. The course is chiefly theoretical and
does not include practical work on transmitting
apparatus. . In order to be eligible, the student
must be employed in the radio trade. Further
particulars are obtainable from the college.
(1) Where can 1 obtain instruction in talking-
picture operating? (2) Particulars of course?
(3) Duration? (4) Cost?— 27Bs.
(1) Marconi School of Wireless, 97 Clarence-
street, Sydney. (2) and. (3) The course extends
over 12 months, nine of which are by corre-
spondence. During the remaining three the
student attends the school for practical instruc-
tion. A certificate is issued to all students
who pass the examination held on completion
of the course. (4) £lB 18s.
(1) Is the finding of water by means of the
divining rod an accepted scientific fact ? (2)
Any scientific explanation ? (3) What is the
usual method used ? —2398.
(1) No. (2) Nothing to explain. Successes
claimed are merely fortunate coincidences. Many
of those who practise this “art” have been put
to the test by scientists the world over and
have been proved to be quite unreliable. (3)
A forked twig a few inches in length is
used. The ends of the forks are held” hori-
zontally, one in each hand, with the forearms
held in front of, and at right angles to, the
body. The operators claim that when they are
at a point vertically over subsurface water the
stick refuses to stay horizontal, assuming the
vertical in spite of resistance by pressure be-
tween fourth fingers and palms of hands.
How to eradicate worms in lawns ? —2749.
Cover the lawn with a dressing of agricultural
lime and water it in. Do not roll the lawns
thus riddled, or the soft spongy ground will
break and the level surface will be spoilt and
the grass killed. In very badly-wormed lawns
it is sometimes preferable to dig out the lawn
in squares of turf and reset. That can be left
until September.
What is the value of seaweed as manure for
a flower garden ? —2738.
Seaweed is rich in nitrogen and potash. Dig
it into the soil while fresh; the sun quickly
causes it to lose manurial effect. Seaweed is
especially beneficial to sandy soils, and helps to
retain the moisture, particularly when mixed
freely with grass and weeds. It is not advisable
to use without the addition of cow or horse
manure.
Names and addresses of societies in Sydney

When and how should waratali seeds be sown
in Sydney ? What soil is suitable ? —2659.
Waratah seeds can be sown from September
to November, in the garden or in seed pans or
boxes. It is advisable to have the boxes per-
forated and covered with a layer of drainage
material, such as crocks, cinders and charcoal.
The soil should be kept damp, but not too wet.
(1) Can human beings get diseases other
than hydatids and tapeworms front dogs ?
(2) Any statistics of such cases treated at hos-
pitals ? (3) Are there regulations in N. S. Wales
against dogs being allowed in places where
food is kept or prepared ? (4) Are regulations
in the Argentina as regards dogs still as strict
as they were 25 years ago ? (5) What be-
came of a film showing the diseases human
beings can get from dogs and the danger of
handling them, imported to Australia some
time ago ? —2446
(1) Yes, there are skin diseases and remote
lesions that suggest definite animal infection.
Distemper in puppies resembles measles, and
mange is closely allied to skin itch in the human
subject. The rabid dog transmits hydrophobia;
fortunately Australia is free of this scourge.
(2) Records are not available. (3) The Pure
Food Act, 1908, requires that animals (dogs,
etc.) be excluded from places where food is
prepared for human consumption. (4) Regu-
lations to exclude rabies are still enforced.
Aerial quarantine is now essential. (5) Film
cannot be traced.
(1) Where could I buy mutton-bird oil, and
price ? (2) Has it been known to cure rheuma-

aged 28 ? (5) Price of garlic powder in
Sydney ? (6) Where can I buy butter preserva-
tive in Sydney, and price ? (7) Cure for
corns ? —2458.
(1) Mutton-bird oil from Elliott’s and Aus-
tralian Drug, Ltd., Sydney, 10s. per gal. (2)
Gives relief as external rub in rheumatoid
arthritis, the oil being readily absorbed by ex-
ternal tissues. It is not a cure. (3) There is no
specific: much depends upon the individual
case. Treatment under medical supervision is
advisable. (4) Age is in patient’s favor. Hospi-
tal attention with diathermy and applied heat
should be sought. (5) Garlic (dry), 3s. per
pound. Powder not procurable. (6) Mauri

The gums of my 11-year-old child bleed very
easily. Does that show a tendency to
pyorrhoea ? —2528.
It is unusual for a child of that age to
develop true pyorrhoea; the bleeding gums
suggest gingivitis or local inflammation, or the
trait may be inherited. Constitutional debili-
ties associated with malnutrition demand atten-
tion as a preliminary to treatment. Use
tincture of myrrh (a few drops in a wineglass
of warm water) as a mouthwash, and gargle
after meals; rinse the mouth with an alka-
line antiseptic at night. Chemical food may
be given as a tonic.
Particulars of the following pigments : (1)
Red ochre; (2) yellow ochre; (3) black ochre ?
(4) Composition of pure Prussian blue ? —2772.
(1) Chiefly a compound of double silicates,
or clays, colored with oxide of iron. The
predominance of oxides or silicates decides the
grade. (2) Composed essentially of clay stained
with iron oxide, but in the yellows it is hydrated
oxide. (3) Made by calcining yellow ochre with
gas tar. (4) (a) Iron sulphate, 100 parts by
weight; ( b ) potash-alum, 200 parts; (c) yellow
prussiate of potash, 100 parts. Dissolve (a)
and ( b ) in five times their weight of cold
water, ahd add the mixture to (c) dissolved in
10 times its weight of cold water. Settle, wash
and filter.
Details concerning the Whelan Prospecting
Expedition which met with disaster in W.A.
about 18 months ago ? —2760.
On December 22, 1932, a D.H.50 aircraft
which was hired from W.A. Airways, Ltd., with
H. Baker (pilot) and Messrs. P. Whelan and
N. Stuckey as passengers, left Forrest in search
of a gold reef near the Livesey Ranges. It
was intended to land at some suitable spot and
drop Whelan and Stuckey. The destination of
the aircraft was kept a close secret, and not for
some days was anxiety felt when the aircraft
failed to return to Forrest. Air searches were
subsequently instituted, but on December 26
the D.H.50 landed at Cook, five days overdue.
It transpired that, when about 200 miles north
of Forrest, engine trouble developed and a
forced landing was made on a salt pan. The
aircraft overturned, but was eventually righted,
propeller changed and the aircraft repaired.
As there was doubt about the aircraft taking off
with full load from the soft and somewhat
restricted area, Whelan was left behind. Whelan
was later located and was kept supplied with
water and provisions dropped on parachutes
from R.A.A.F. Wapiti aircraft. On January 5,
1933, Baker landed again on the salt pan and
rescued Whelan.
Salary of probationary nurses at (1) Prince
Alfred Hospital ? (2) Sydney Hospital ? —2392.
(1) First year £3O, second £4O, third £5O,
fourth £65 p.a. (2) First year £36, second £4B,
third £6O, fourth £67 p.a. Uniforms and board
and lodging are provided in each case. The
salaries paid by Sydney Hospital include 20 p.c.
bonus on account of long hours and inferior

From China to Peru.
“Middle Passage”: The British Govern-
ment is making a special effort to sup-
press the slave trade across the Red Sea
from Abyssinia to Arabia. Extra-fast
ships have been put on the job, it having
been reported, rightly or wrongly, that
some of the sailing dhows carrying the
slaves kept ahead of pursuers by throw-
ing a slave or two overboard. Such old
fashions die hard. In some of Marryatt's
novels, and in “Tom Cringle’s Log,” that
fine chronicle of the British war against
slavers, this habit is frequently referred
to. Of course it meant diminished profit,
but, if successful, it amounted to insur-
ance against total loss.

“Ex-P.B.L”: No one who ever wore
one will mourn the passing of “helmets,
steel, one” (B. 25/7/’34). The “tin-hat'
in the British Army owes its genesis to
months of intensive propaganda waged by
the “Daily Mail,” or so it was claimed.
It gave a certain amount of protection
from small flying splinters, but against
bullets fired from any range it was use-
less. If the chin-strap was used (strictly
against all orders) and the wearer got a
clout on the back of the head from a
hurtling clod of earth, he was liable to
have his neck broken. The first speci-
mens issued presented a smooth and
glossy surface to the sharp noses ol
bullets striking at very oblique angles,
and they glanced off—sometimes. The
sun shining down the glossy lids helio-
graphed the position of the troops to the i
enemy. Later on a sort of granulated
paint was used on the helmets, and this
occasionally deflected bullets inwards,
with disastrous results for the wearer.

“Aerodrome”: As one well acquainted
with Heliopolis, outside Cairo, I read
with interest, but with no surprise, that
£4OOO-worth of gold bullion landed there
by an aeroplane from Central Africa
vanished like the rain on the river before
it was due to be shipped to another ’plane
for transport to Britain. I once had to
exercise control over some 1000 Gyppo
syces who were looking after the horses j
of the Ist A.L.H. Brigade. These in- j
sanitary ruffians lived near by, not in j
Heliopolis itself, but in rookeries round !
about, including Zeitoun. I believe that
any one would have readily committed
murder for 25 piastres, provided the
victim was not a white man. Nothing
that wasn’t nailed down in the Brigade
camp was safe from them, and when the
fortnightly pay was over they took turns
at robbing each other with violence on
the way home. I note that an Armenian
and an Egyptian have been arrested in
connection with the robbery. That com-
bination is enough to ensure conviction
without hearing the evidence.

“Sarie Marais”: Cabled that evidence j
has been dug up among the Transvaal
archives at Pretoria that the Rand was
known to the Boers as a gold formation
as far back as 1853, 30 years before the
field was officially located. It is also
stated that specimens from the reef were
shown in the Parliament of Potchefstroom,
one of the independent republics welded
into one by the British annexation. The
news was suppressed, so the story runs,
and the finder was bound to keep silence
under pain of death, the idea being that
a rush of goldseekers would overwhelm
the pastoral republics, as was eventually
the case. The tale is difficult to follow.
Potchefstroom is a long way from the
Rand and south-west of that formation.
Alluvial gold was got from the Vaal near
by many years ago, and other fields in
the Transvaal were being worked by
Uitlanders long before Jo’burg, notably
Barberton. Further, the Rand stone
writer has seen gives no indication ex-
cept to the expert of its gold content. It j
is asking a good deal to believe that the
Boers, always eager for a profitable deal,
sat on this mountain of wealth for years
and never said a word to the prospectors
who, from the Kimberley days onwards,
were combing South Africa for gold and
diamonds.

“Blah”: The Australian yelper press
has no monopoly of cricket fustian.
London “Star” unfolded a wondrous j
yarn of how the Notts pitmen had
arranged to attend the first Test at Trent
Bridge en masse and barrack the Austra-
lians as a payback for the alleged treat- j
ment of Larwood. Nothing of the kind
happened, of course, but, after pitching
the tale, the journal adds: “It will be
interesting to see how the M.C.C. copes
with the nuisance which they so coldly
ordered [sfc] the Australian Board to
suppress.” There is evidently a lot of
England “which thinks its Empire still
is the Strand and Holborn Hill,” with the
blasted colonies cringing hat in hand for
a pat on the back from the Old Squire.

SPLENDID ROAD PERFORMANCE OF
DODGE D.R. SEDAN.
BY FRED BERRY.
HIGH AVERAGE SPEED, FLEXIBILITY AND GOOD PETROL
CONSUMPTION.
First to provide a supply of standardised replacement parts
to the Australian market, the manufacturers of the Dodge car
have established a reputation for reliability under strenuous con-
ditions together with low operating costs.
Year after year each new model shows an improvement in
speed, acceleration and accessibility, while the features of
reliability and economy remain unimpaired.
Tested recently over The Bulletin’s
course, the 1934 D.R. Dodge showed
itself docile and easy to handle at
low speeds. Things begin to happen
when the throttle is pressed down
—acceleration figures for a touring sedan
Graceful streamlined profile of the 1934 D.R. Dodge Sedan.
would do credit to a racing two-
seater of two years ago. Suspension is
good, and the car is easily controlled,
safe and comfortable at all speeds.
Free-wheeling, automatic clutch and
synchromesh gears make operation fool-
proof ; gear-changing is simple at any
speed, and independent front-wheel sus-
pension and hydraulic brakes give the
driver complete control in all circum-
stances.
Modern ideas of streamlining are
incorporated in the bodywork, and the in-
Pin-type roller-bearing universal joints
fitted to Dodge propeller-shaft.
ternal fittings are neat and good. Run-
ning-boards are pressed steel with
moulded rubber treads, and should give
no trouble during the life of the body.
The car tested was a standard model
D.R. sedan, driven by J. Allport, of
Harden and Johnson, Ltd., N.S.W. dis-
tributors. Weighbridge tally, including
driver and observer, was 3l|cwt. The
speedometer showed 7056 miles, and the
motor had been thoroughly run in and
was quite smooth and free frdm vibra-
tion throughout its speed range. As cer-
tain performance tests depended upon
precision in speedometer readings the car
was first taken to the Heenan and Froude
testing machine, where comparisons with
standard instruments were made, the
Dodge speedo being correct to 40 m.p.h.
and 4 p.c. fast at 60.
First impression on entering the city
traffic stream was of 'excellent top-gear
acceleration. Leaving Parramatta and
passing over the open roads through
Baulkham Hills the speedometer needle
quickly moved to the 60 mark, scarcely
any throttle opening being required to
maintain this speed, which would appar-
ently be a comfortable touring gait for
the Dodge on country roads.
On the coasting section near Windsor
the gear-lever was put in neutral at a
road speed of 15 m.p.h., and a distance
of 680 yards was covered before coming
to a standstill.
Maximum speed was then tested over
a measured- mile, the time taken being
48sec., averaging 75 m.p.h. During this
run the engine ran smoothly and the car
steered easily without any tendency to
wandering or wheel bounce.
Through Richmond the dirt road by-
pass through Grose Vale was taken, and
over this narrow and difficult section
steering and road-holding qualities were
found to be excellent.
The climb of Kurrajong Mountain was
the next event, and, our pilot expressing
a desire to make the first attempt in top
gear, the starting line was crossed at 5
m.p.h. Acceleration from this stage was
extraordinary. Although the hairpin
bends necessitated the use of brakes and
a speed reduction to 25 m.p.h., the Dodge
completed the climb
in top without the
slightest difficulty,
crossing the finishing
line over extremely
rough going and on
the steepest portion at
a speed of approxi-
mately 40 m.p.h.—
time 3min. 52sec. A
further climb was
then made, using
middle and top gears,
from a standing start,
and on this occasion,
in spite of very sedate
and safe cornering,
the time occupied, 3min. 18sec., was
excellent. Returning to Richmond, emer-
gency braking equipment was tested
while descending the mountain, with
satisfactory results.
A test of handiness in traffic involved
covering 350 yards in top gear as slowly
as possible, followed immediately by a
similar distance —still in top —on full
throttle. In this dual test, extraordinary
figures were established on the slow-
running section ; with automatic clutch
in use, the time taken was 6min. Bsec.,
an average of 1.9 m.p.h.—a new record
for slow running. It should be men-
tioned, however, that, with an automatic
clutch, the clutch is withdrawn each time
the foot is taken from the accelerator,
and a skilful driver can keep the speed
so low in top that the difficulty lies in
determining when the roadwheels have
ceased turning. As the automatic clutch
is standard equipment its use in slow
running must be allowed.
Before reaching the start of the accel-
erated section the Dodge had shown
such splendid results in the slow test that

the throttle was opened before the start-
ing line. Picking up very smartly and
crossing the finishing line at 60 m.p.h.,
the car established another record, time
occupied being 15 3-ssec., averaging 46.1
m.p.h.
Time was taken of an acceleration
from 0 to 50 m.p.h. (allowing for speed-
ometer error) from a standing start, the
clock showing 12 3-ssec. Acceleration
from 10 to 30 in top and second gave
similarly favorable results, the times
being 7sec. and 4 3-ssec. respectively.
It is desirable, with pick-up of this
order available, that braking equip-
ment should be particularly efficient. In
a trial from a road speed of 25 m.p.h.,
the hydraulic brakes brought the car to
rest in 21ft. 6in. Turning circles on both
right and left lock measured 41ft.
The time taken for the complete jour-
ney of 124 miles was 3hr. lOmin., an
average speed of 39 m.p.h., inclusive of
all tests. Petrol consumed, sgal. Iqt.,
gave an average consumption of 23.6
m.p.g.—37.5 ton-miles, a fine result, par-
ticularly when the high average speed is
taken into consideration.

The Automatic Clutch
and Effortless Driving
Here is the opportunity you have long awaited
—to forget the annoyance of a clutch pedal. In
the new Chrysler-Plymouth Six with automatic
clutch you can sit on your left foot if you find
comfort that way, for it is no longer needed
in driving. The Chrysler-Plymouth automatic
clutch is simple and foolproof. There is nothing
new to learn. Your gear shift lever becomes
a gear selector. You can move it noiselessly
and effortlessly into every gear—even reverse.

AUSTRALIA’S MOTORING BEGINNINGS.
FIRST CAR WAS AUSTRALIAN-BUILT.
Nearly 37 years ago, in November,
1897, John Pender, of Brunswick (Vic.),
made motoring history in the Common-
wealth by importing a Hertel, manufac-
tured in Chicago. Pender was the pioneer
maker of horseshoe-nails in Australia,
and his Brunswick factory was at one
period the only plant of its kind in the
Southern Hemisphere. In a trial run in
Melbourne the Hertel travelled nine
miles on a gallon of naphtha. The vehicle,
now in the Melbourne Technological
Museum, was controlled by one lever-
arm.
But this was not Australia’s first auto-
mobile. The first motor-car to appear
on the road in the Commonwealth was
built in Victoria, the invention of Her-
bert Thompson, an Armadale engineer.
A self-propelled, steam-driven, pneu-
matic-tyred car, it was capable of carry-
ing six passengers, and appeared in the
streets of Melbourne in 1896. Exhibited
at a Royal Agricultural Show, it at-
traded the notice of Lord Brassey, who
accepted an invitation to ride in it.
The car was sent to Sydney Show of
1900, after which it was used to make
the first overland car trip from Sydney to
Melbourne, the route including some
extremely rough bush roads. It was
decided at Bathurst to attempt a speed
record for the remainder of the journey,
The car covered 493 miles in 58 hours,
Mr. Thompson had for a passenger on
that historic trip E. Holmes, who later
became first secretary of the Vic. Auto-
mobile Club. Mr. Thompson offered a
gold medal for the best motor-car exhi-
bited at the Melbourne Show of 1900.
Five entries were received, but only two
cars were presented for judging—Thomp-
son s steam car and a De Dion, owned
by J- H. Craven (later to become a
pioneer racing driver). The judges voted
for the loca ! product. Incidentally, this
was Australia s first motor show. The
Thompson car continued in service for
some . years, and in 1905 it made another
run into'N.S.W.
Another Australian-made horseless
carriage” came to light in the same year
as Thompson s vehicle. It was built by
Henry Austin for the Australian Horse-
*ess Carnage C 0., of Melbourne, and

was driven on naphtha. Lord Brassey had
a seat in a trial run at the Exhibition
Grounds.
By 1898 there were several motor-
tricycles on the streets of Melbourne.
H. W. Harrison (now secretary of the
Chamber of Automotive Industries) was
one of the first to use such a means of
conveyance in Australia. His three-
wheeler was an Aerial, with a De Dion
engine, surface-fed carburettor and tube
ignition, imported from England. In
1898, too, a 4i-h.p. De Dion arrived to
the order of the Dunlop Rubber Co. In
1899 Arthur Renard (a foundation mem-
ber of the Vic. Automobile Association)
imported a 2-cyl., wire-wheeled Winton
car, and imported 4-cyl. models.
W. J. C. Elliot has been credited with
being the first to import a car into
Sydney, his De Dion making its appear-
ance in the streets in 1900. Charles B.
Kellow, well known then as a racing
cyclist and now equally well known in
the motoring world, imported his first
automobile to Melbourne in the same
year, a small one-seater.
In 1903 the Royal Automobile Club of
Vic. was founded by ten pioneer
motorists, and in a practical celebration
of the occasion five motor-cars (almost
all Melbourne could then boast) were
driven by their proud owners to Mordial-
loc. One of the party, T. Rand, still a
motorist, made further history that year
by importing a 4-cyl. car, which
marked a distinct advance on previous
importations.
Another milestone in motoring his-
tory was Melbourne’s first prosecution
for speeding, which occurred in 1903, A.
Renard being the culprit. Driving a
Rochet car, one Sunday morning he raced
a cable-tram which happened to be carry-
ing an inspector of police. At the old
Melbourne Police Court Renard was
charged with having exceeded the
hackney-carriage speed limit of 12 miles
per hour, and was fined ten shillings.
In 1904 J. Cecil McKay, the Albury
pastoralist, imported a Darracq, and used
it for many years on his property. Vic.’s
first Ford arrived in 1904, too, the owner-
importer being R. W. Denyer, of Moonee
Ponds. In April of the same year the
first motor gymkhana in Vic. took place
at Maribyrnong.
In 1905 the Dunlop Rubber Co. pro-
moted the first inter-State motor-car
reliability trial, from Sydney to Mel-
bourne. Threats were made in one
township on the approved route that
bullock-waggon chains would be drawn
across the track to prevent the test tak-
ing place, but those threats were not
carried out. Twenty-three cars started.
17 of them reaching Melbourne. The
trial lasted five days. Seven contestants
reached Melbourne without loss of
points—Capt. H. Tarrant, founder of
Tarrant’s Motors Co. (12-h.p., 2-cyl.
Argyll), J. H. Craven (8-h.p., 1-cyl. De
Dion), S. H. Day (8-h.p., 1-cyl. De
Dion), H. L. Stevens (12-h.p., 2-cyl.
Darracq), J. G. Coleman (7-h.p., 1-cyl.
Swift), W. S. Ross (12-h.p., 2-cyl. Argyll),
S. Stott (12-h.p., 4-cyl. Decauville). In a
run-off from Melbourne to Ballarat and
back (140 miles) Capt. Tarrant was
placed first, J. H. Craven second and S.
H. Day third.
In addition to those already mentioned,
C. H. Perrin (formerly chief mechanic for
the Tarrant Motor Co., and afterwards
technical engineer to the Vacuum Oil
Co), Cecil de Fraga (noted speed driver
in his day), Howard Lewis, W. J. Proctor,
A. Kingsmith, Macpherson Robertson
(the confectionery manufacturer) and Dr.
R. Wood (the first physician in Mel-
bourne to drive a car in connection with
his work) were motoring pioneers in Vic-
toria.
The principals of the original “Floro-
dOra” co. travelled to Bendigo in one of
Melbourne’s early cars.
Handling the New Car.
Care Essential During Running-in Period.
Every motorist knows something
about the precautions to be taken while
running-in a new car engine, but recent
researches have materially altered some
prevalent ideas as to the best way of
carrying out this process. It has been
found that an engine can be just as
badly harmed by over-solicitous care as
by thoughtless handling. The engine of
a new car turns stiffly for two reasons ;
first, the bearings and pistons are fitted
tightly, with minimum clearances, and,
second, the working surfaces, how-
ever carefully machined, are marred by
microscopic irregularities. In the course
of running-in these surfaces are bur-
nished until smooth, and clearances are
increased, both changes tending to re-
duce friction. Burnishing involves the
generation of heat, but if the surfaces
are to be smoothed, a certain amount of
pressure is essential. Therefore, the first
and most important requirement is an
adequate supply of lubricant which will
reduce friction and carry away the heat
generated. Not only must oil be main-
tained at the proper level in the sump,
but, in addition, it is essential that a
reasonably light oil of the right grade
be used.
Particular care is necessary when start-
ing a stiff engine from cold, because the
oil is then thick and sluggish. It has to
flow from the pump through a filter, a
number of very small passages and a
series of tight bearings before it is

V-gutter.
thrown into the cylinders by the rotating
crankshaft; consequently very little oil
reaches the cylinder bores and pistons
during the first couple of minutes.
This is where the over-cautious owner-
driver is apt to make his first mistake,
He may set the engine at much too low
an idling speed when allowing it to
warm up. In so doing, he extends the
time required and reduces the quantity
of oil thrown into the cylinders. The
proper speed is from 1000 to 1200 r.p.m.,
which can be roughly judged as about
the rate at which the engine revolves
when the car is travelling at 20 m.p.h.
on top gear. Too low a working tempera-
ture does an engine far more harm than
running too hot.
The golden rule for running-in a new
car is to avoid sustained periods of hard
work which will raise the oil tempera-
ture to too high a figure. Provided that
this is remembered, short bursts of
speed at intervals will be found advan-
tageous. Otherwise, general running
should be done with an engine speed
not greater than 2000 r.p.m., represent-
ing about 33 m.p.h. On the other hand,
while over-revving is harmful, the
engine should not be allowed to labor
at full throttle ; it is better to change
down on a stiff hill than to hang on to
top gear, always provided that an exces-
sive speed is not maintained on the lower
gear.
After 500 miles have been run care is
still required, and the best method is to
increase the load and speed bit by bit,
with more frequent full-throttle periods.
With'such treatment, by the time 1000
miles have been covered the car can be
quite freely used. At this stage, how-
ever, it is very important to have the oil
filters cleaned and the sump thoroughly
drained and refilled with fresh oil, as
running-in results in the abrasion of a
certain amount of metallic dust which
mixes with the oil and is harmful to the
bearings.
Motor Oddities.
“Pommy”: After 30 years of driving,
testing and servicing all types and sizes
of cars, I don’t believe in wizard per-
formances until given a practical demon-
stration. But a Rolls-Royce opened my
eyes last week. After the car had been
standing in a garage for three days, Chas.
Todman took the driver’s seat in his
Phantom (1927), switched on, waggled
the ignition lever and the motor started
instantly—no starter motor. Once started
every notch on the throttle quadrant gave
an equal increase in engine speed, show-
ing perfect mechanical
condition, while, on the
road, set to any predeter-
mined speed, the auto-
matic governor, up hill
and down dale, kept that
speed almost exactly cor-
rect.

“Jo”: Last week John
Nicholson, a Dalby (Q.)
grazier, had a marvellous
escape when his car col-
lided with a railway
engine at a level crossing.
He applied the brakes,
but was too close to stop, so he tried to
turn round. The cowcatcher struck the
car side on, cutting it in two, and both
sections were smashed into a tangled
mass. It took over 15 minutes to extract
John from the debris, yet he escaped with
a few scratches on the arm, and was able
to walk to his home near by.

“Mcs”: I travel over most of Aus-
tralia and M.L. by car and I’ve done
this for ten years. Here are some fruits
of that experience. The worst road is
between Rockhampton and Ayr (N.Q.).
The best roads and the best system of
signposting are M.L.’s. Queensland has
a minimum of signposts. My most in-
genious repair was when I applied chew-
ing-gum to a leak in a petrol pipe. The
hardest city to drive in in all Austra-
lasia is Christchurch (M.L.). Here
cyclists are numbered by the thousand,
and each of them is apparently a law
unto himself. Best drivers are those of
Sydney, who give all the signals as a
rule.
Motor Oddities.
When motorists foregather the topics of conversation seldom
centre in technical or abstract features, but rather in personal
experiences or achievements.
Arguments wax hot where petrol consumption or speeds over
specified routes are concerned, and the cost of maintenance and the
present mechanical condition of cars after years of use are matters
of extreme interest. Huge annual mileages, old driving licenses, and
perhaps low car numbers support claims to experience, while many
drivers, with characteristic Australian ingenuity, have made interest-
ing emergency repairs.
Who holds No. 1 license or drives No. 1 car in each State, and
who drove the first car?
Who has driven more than 500,000 miles, and which driver
covers the greatest distance each year?
Thrills and extraordinary driving experiences have not been
confined to racing drivers, while outback the bush mechanic,
hundreds of miles from repair shops, has worked miracles in order
to get the car home.
Motorists are invited to write to “The Bulletin” and recount
their experiences.

H.M. (Annandalc, N.S.W.): Yes, an upper
cylinder lubricator is a good investment —with
this fitted there is no need to use oil in petrol.
R.8.8.: (1) Internal shorting is due
to the formation of sulphate, inevitable if
battery is left standing for long periods with-
out charge. (2) Oil hole is over armature bear-
ing. (3) Wheel should turn easily unless brakes
are binding or pinion too closely meshed. (4)
No possible method of deciding how far the
car must run to fully charge battery
W.S. (Campsie, N.S.W.): Necessary to have
existing rims cleaned and plated or new rims

THE IMPORTANCE OF BY-PASSING THE
DETECTOR.
BY DON B. KNOCK.
The reader will often notice the little
condenser connected between the plate
of a detector valve and earth (or cathode)
in a circuit diagram. This condenser
serves a most useful purpose in by-
passing the radio-frequency currents from
Figure 1.
the plate to earth. Having a very low
impedance to radio-frequency currents,
the radio-frequency voltage developed at
the plate is consequently small. As a
result, the feedback through the valve
is reduced by this by-pass capacity.
Stronger signals may thus be handled by
the detector valve and the selectivity of
the tuned circuit is noticeably better than
when no by-pass condenser is used. This
may be proved by experiment with a
receiver, preferably of the tuned R.F.
type with a non-regenerative detector.
The addition of a .0005 mfd. con-
denser between plate and cathode will
show a definite improvement in selec-
tivity and signal strength. Connecting
and disconnecting the condenser on a
constant signal such as that produced
by a modulated oscillator will show the
difference. The reason why this change
in the plate circuit affects the tuning of
the grid circuit is because the plate
circuit is coupled to the grid circuit by
a condenser formed by the grid and
plate elements of the valve. The signal
Figure 2.
applied to the grid of the valve is a
modulated radio-frequency voltage, and
the purpose of the detector is to extract
the audio frequency from the modulated
R.F.
A capacity of from .0003 mfd. to .0005
mfd. is sufficient to make feedback neg-
ligible. In the plate circuit the total
capacity is made up from the capacity
of the by-pass condenser, the wiring, and
the audio-frequency coupling, plus the
plate-to-cathodc capacity of the valve.
Fig. 1 shows how the by-pass condenser
is connected, and the dotted lines show
an alternative method of connection.
The plate-to-cathode method is more
effective.
Fig. 2 shows a detector with the addi-
tion of reaction, using the Reinartz
method as widely used in short-wave
receivers and in many home-made
broadcast receivers.
Now the feedback coil and the re-
action condenser Cl have to be con-
sidered, for a certain amount of R.F.
current passes through the feedback cir-
cuit. As the capacity of Cl is increased
so the amount of current through this
circuit increases. The total amount of
capacity in the plate circuit may be so
Figure 3.
great that the higher audio frequencies
are weakened, but this is largely depen-
dent upon the impedance of the valve
used and the audio coupling. The
correct practice is to use no more capa-
city in the plate circuit than is necessary,
but because the variation of the reaction
condenser will cause a change in audio
quality, the “differential” method of
reaction control may be used with ad-
vantage.
The differential condenser has two sets
of stator plates and a common rotor.
One stator is connected to the plate of
the valve and the plate side of the feed-
back coil, the other stator to the other
side of the coil, and the rotor to the
cathode (or earth). This is illustrated
in Fig. 3, and readers using receivers
with condenser control of reaction will
find this differential method a distinct
improvement. Such split-stator con-
densers can be obtained in Australia,
and the reader with mechanical ability
can readily reconstruct some types of
variable condensers to provide a twin
stator from the single stator.
HUNT THAT HUM.
Many letters asking for technical advice
contain reference to hum in receivers. Be-
yond the possibility of such trouble with
a backyard product, in nine cases out
of ten the interior economy of the com-
mercially designed receiver may be elimi-
nated as the possible source of the
trouble, and other factors must be sought
for.
As home constructors, even in 1934,
make up a goodly proportion of readers
of any radio publication, consideration
will primarily be given in this article
to possible faults in amateur receiver
construction from which hum trouble
may arise.
The Causes.
A most likely source of trouble in the
case of an all-electric receiver is the
power supply itself, associated with the
power transformer, rectifier and filtering
system. Then there is the aerial-earth
system with which the receiver is used,
and lastly the introduction of hum within
the receiver itself by unwanted coupling
between some part of the R.F. or audio
circuits and the power circuits.
Faulty filtering of the high-voltage
supply after transformation from the
A.C. mains is the most common source
of trouble. The alternating-current
mains are supposed to be of a standard
frequency, this being almost universally
50 cycles per second. Unfortunately the
wave-form may not be a perfect 50-
cycle sine wave because of ripples cor-
responding to higher harmonics. There-
fore the high-voltage supply after leav-
ing the rectifier in the receiver is not
steady but pulsating direct current, with
the pulsations at twice the frequency of
the A.C. supply. In addition to this it
contains any ripple present in the original
240-volt A.C. supply. The duty of
smoothing out these ripples rests with
the filter circuit. In explanation of the
action of the filter choke it may be said
that it passes the direct current portion
of the supply, but “chokes” the ripple,
which is shunted by the by-pass con-
densers. As the condensers act more as
buffers than condensers, by reason of
which the electrolytic condenser becomes
applicable, they absorb power during the
peaks and pass on power during the
fluctuations in between the ripple peaks,
Thug, if filtering is insufficient because
the choke may be of too low an im-
pedance or because the condensers are
of too small capacity, a certain amount
of ripple remains in the high-voltage D.C.
supply. This is passed on to the plates
of the valves of the receiver, and the
resulting hum is amplified. The power-
pack arrangement must therefore have
proper filtering.
The next source of hum trouble is that
of the receiver itself. When the receiver
circuits pick up the hum by inter-coup-
ling this is not due to the filtering system,
which may, even with a receiver develop-
ing excessive hum, be faultless. The
trouble arises from magnetic or capaci-
tative coupling between portions of the
receiver circuit and those circuits carry-
ing alternating current. This may prob-
ably be traced to poorly-arranged low-
voltage heater wiring, and it may be
found that such wiring, carrying fairly
heavy current, passes close to the grids
of the valves. In such a case the heater
wiring should either be shielded with
copper braid (and earthed) or removed
to a position well way from the grid
circuits.
There are cases of hum due to poor
receiver design which to the experienced
radio mechanic will be obvious. Where
a receiver includes audio couplings such
as high-impedance chokes or audio trans-
formers, such components should be
mounted well away from the power
transformer. If an audio choke, par-
ticularly an unscreened one, is in the
powerful magnetic field of the power
transformer, the resulting hum is likely
to be very bad indeed. This is one of
the commonest mistakes with the inex-
perienced constructor, and it falls under
the heading of “layout.”
Hum introduced through the aerial
or earth is not usually so serious, and
can be remedied with little trouble.
Cures.
The first thing to do when endeavor-
ing to locate the cause of hum in a
receiver is the simple action of reversing
the plug in the power-point on the wall.
This changes over the side of the power
transformer connected to earth. Next,
the earth connection to the receiver
should be examined. If it is a water-
pipe clip arrangement, make sure that
the surface of the pipe under the clip is
clean and that the clip is gripping tightly.
A high-resistance contact here can be
responsible for developing a hum volt-
age across it if the earth lead couples
inductively with any part of the house
wiring. Next examine the aerial. If this
passes close to any lighting or power
wires it is most likely a source of hum
trouble, and the aerial should be
arranged clear of power circuits.
These simple possibilities having been
dealt with, the receiver itself is next
in line for inspection. Look over the
rectifier valve, and ascertain that both
filaments are heated. If one filament of
a full-wave rectifier is open-circuited or
has lost emission, the power unit will
still work as a half-wave supply, but with
greatly increased ripple. Similarly, the
effect would be the same with one half
of the high-voltage secondary of the
power transformer broken down.
Electrolytic filter condensers should
next receive attention. If these are leaky
An arrangement, for
slopping interference arriving via
the mains
(electrically, not physically) a heavy load
will be thrown on the rectifier and trans-
former, and hum will result, with accom-
panying poor performance of the re-
ceiver due to decreased voltage distribu-
tion. Electrolytic condensers should be
suspected if they feel hot to the touch
beyond the normal warmth of the
chassis. Open-circuited by-pass conden-
sers in detector, R.F. or audio decoup-
ling circuits can also be responsible for
development of bad hum. The trouble
is that in decoupling circuits minus
the by-pass capacity the resistance actu-
ally does the opposite to what is re-
quired, and the voltage across the resist-
ance may set up hum.
Summarising: Practically all hum
trouble in radio receivers can be traced
to poor contacts developing a high re-
sistance or to incorrectly-placed com-
ponents or wires. Always associated with
the trouble is radio-inductive interference,
particularly where the aerial is picking
up hum from the lighting or power cir-
cuits. It is always worth while to use
a line-filter as in the diagram illustrated
such accessories are obtainable commer-
cially and are not expensive. The line-
filter is not an infallible cure for line
noises, but it is nearly always a help, and
in many cases astonishingly effective.
Country Short-wave Explorations.
The early part of the week has been
rather poor for reception lately so far as
night or early morning was concerned.
RVIS was an exception. Signal strength
on this station was as good as could be
wished for The D.E.I. station in the
49m. band was also really good on July
19, but weak most nights. On the 20th
static and noise level were exceptional
for this time of the year right down to
31m.
On the 21st, DJC, 49.8 m., and RFN.
49.9 m., were at good strength after 6.30
a.m., but weakened rapidly about 7.15.

gong was used as an interval signal.
In the early mornings GSB, on 31.5 m.,
has been fair strength, and after 1 a.m.
good enough for the reception of the
cricket direct. A recent Sunday morning,
after 8 a.ni., was very good, with the
exception of the League of Nations,
HBL, 31.3 m., which was very weak.
Only part of the English sessions could
be followed. This is unusual, as HBL
generally stands out. WIXAZ, 3J.3m.,
was the best heard for a long time, and
later in the day W2XAF, about 10.30,

GSB, in the 3 Ini. band, were good speaker
strength. FYA was fair from 9 a.m.
until closing down at 3 p.m., with, as
usual, strength rising to maximum just
before closing. Another foreign station

The 80m. band has been most erratic.

What’s What in Radio.
During the four week-ends in October,
Australian radio transmitting amateurs
will contribute considerably to the pub-
licity surrounding the Melbourne cen-
tenary celebrations. They will take part
in an international long-distance contest,
in which amateurs of all countries are
invited to join. Australians have partici-
pated in contests arranged overseas, but
this is the first occasion on which the
Commonwealth has taken the initiative.
The affair is under the ;egis of the Wire-
less Institute of Australia, the prime
mover being R. H. Cunningham,

Soviet Russia claims a total of
12,000,000 listeners. In other countries,
such a total would mean big business in
radio receivers,, but the Soviet listener
averages a large number to one “master
receiver, the mass being reached by the
“collective” system.
A listener may possess his own receiver;
he may be connected to a radio ex-
change ; he may listen to a "“sub-station,
or he may be in a “collective-listener
group.” In the exchange system, pro-
grammes are picked up by a central
“master” receiver and relayed by land-
line to houses and apartments. The
“sub-station” is a similar scheme, but
mainly installed in factories, loud-
speakers being placed at various points,
including “correction-houses.” Listeners
cannot use a dial, but must take what
comes from Moscow studios. “Collective
listening” applies mainly to the farms
and industrial centres in the rural areas.
In Leningrad, Moscow and other prin-
cipal cities, loudspeakers are erected in
parks and on street corners.

'blurred over". But in this Stromberg-Carlson Model 504 M
every detail is reproduced—clear, sharp, in perfect focus.
Visit your Stromberg-Carlson dealer to-day. Hear for your-
self what a wonderful difference this "Focussing" has made
to battery-operated radio.
"Sound Focussing’! is not the
only new feature of this Model
504 M. In range, selectivity and
volume too, it will surprise you.
Never before has a battery-
operated receiver offered so
much. You’ve only to hear it
to agree that its performance is
better than many an all-electric

The seizure of a broadcasting station
during the rising in Austria, cul-
minating in the tragic end of Dr. Doll-

Spain. When King Alfonso got his

awoke next morning to be told by an-
nouncers that the monarchy was finished.

To get the best results with an indoor
aerial, it should not be stapled (as it
almost always is) to walls or to a picture-
rail. The aerial should be supported at
least six inches away from wall or roof,
and just as carefully insulated as an out-
door aerial. Try the difference and note
the benefit.

When the steel lattice-work towers
supporting the aerials of high-power
broadcasting stations are painted, the
work must be done out of transmission
hours. Radio-frequency current circulat-
ing in the metal could be dangerous to
workmen on the structure. This is not
due to faulty insulation, but because the
mass of metal is so close to the powerful
field from the aerial.

The 8.8. C. (England) states that veri-

sent to amateurs for the following
reasons: (1) Difficulty of the same pro-
gramme being sent from many trans-
mitters. (2) Empire programmes are
published all over the world before trans-
mission. (3) No useful result is derived
to benefit the service. The 8.8. C. appar-
ently does not realise the pride with
which the short-wave listener exhibits his
QSL cards to his friends. Bureaucracy

is “of a modern composition, consisting
of seven-ply wood having rolled alumi-
nium sheet cemented to one surface.”
Such material should be easily work-
able, and should be useful for many
purposes, particularly for screening.

/ constructed a four-valve battery superhet
front a radio journal, circuit enclosed. The re-
ceiver will not oscillate above 2 FC, and in the
lower wave-lengths there is a decided whistle
when tuned to any station. Could a short-wave
adaptor be constructed for this set ? —79.
You have got things mixed. The receiver
is not a superhet, but a stage of T.R.F., re-
generative detector and two audio stages. There
is no reason why the detector should not oscil-
late above 2FC’s wave-length, but you give
no value for the plate-coupling resistance for
this valve in the diagram. It may not have
enough plate voltage, or the reaction coil could
do with a turn or two more. A short-wave
adaptor may be used with your receiver.
The circuit diagram illustrates an adaptor of
the superhet-converter type in which the screen-
grid valve works as a plate-bend detector-
oscillator autodyne. Any 2-, 4- or 6-volt SG
valve will be suitable. The coils are the
usual plug-in type, with .000175 mfd. tuning
condenser and .0002 reaction condenser. The
small battery in the grid circuit is a cell
for grid bias. The fixed condenser from C-
to earth is .1 mfd.; likewise the screen-grid
by-pass. The adaptor connects to the re-
ceiver as indicated, and must oscillate all the
time stations are being received. Unless it
oscillates smoothly and without background
noise, reception will be poor. With this form
clrcuit of the adaptor
of superhet adaptor, the receiver may be used
at any setting.
/ wish to redesign my tuned R.F. receiver
to use the electron-coupled directly-heated de-
tector as in the “Wide-World Three” ( B.
20 /6/ ’34). Please illustrate a suitable circuit.
—B2.
The circuit shows a suggested combination
for three valves using capacity-coupled T.R.F.
stage. This 20-mmfd. condenser can be one
of the two-plate neutralising condensers, or
may be made up as previously illustrated (B.
25/7/ ’34).
With reference to query 38 (B. 11/7/’34), 1
am sending herewith another diagram of my
D.C. eliminator. The connection on the 4-mfd.
condenser is what lam puzzled about. What
should this connect to ? Please give a circuit
diagram to redesign my 3 -valver to use the
E-C detector as in the “Wide-World Three.”
—77.
The eliminator is quite correct, but you
have been using it without an earth connection.
This 4-mfd. condenser should have the now-
unconnected terminal connected to earth. For
safety’s sake, however, you must not use the
earth connection on the receiver. By means
of this condenser the negative is connected
through the capacity to earth. The requested
diagram will be published at first opportunity.
A neighbor and 1 each purchased a 6-valve
Universal superhet from the same concern. He
gets much better results. His aerial is 40 feet
horizontal and mine is 75 feet almost vertical.
Can I improve matters by erecting another pole
and lengthening the aerial ? Does the direction
of the aerial count ? Recently four valves
failed in my set; would this be due to trouble
in the set or just the end of the valves ? —7B.
If your neighbor has 40 feet of horizontal
aerial at a fair height, he also must have a
fair length of lead-in. Thus his total aerial
length will be much more than yours, with con-
sequently more pick-up. You can add wire
up to 150 feet or more with advantage. As
you are in Central Queensland, a long horizontal
aerial should be advantageous. Arrange the
lead-in end to the south-east, and the aerial will
be directional. Tf the valves were new there
probably is a fault in the set.
Can a wireless receiver of the midget type
be as efficient as the larger models ?— BO.
Depends on the type of midget. So far as
sensitivity and selectivity go, the midget, if
properly designed, is equal to the big set. Tonal
quality is a different matter. You could test
the two types at home before buying.

ASTEROIDS FOR ALL.
BY “LORD LUVUS."
I read that valuable information has
been obtained about the stratosphere by
Kelburn Observatory at Wellington
(M.L.) by means of balloons, one of
which penetrated the area to a height of
15.2 miles. This sounds to me like ob-
taining information about Asia by spend-
ing a week-end at the Seaview Hotel in
Singapore, since space goes on for a con-
siderably greater distance than 15.2 miles,
though it isn’t infinite, according to Pro-
fessor Einstein. However, that is not
the aspect 1 am interested in.
Presumably there were no passengers
in the gas vehicles, but astronautics is
a progressive science, and rocket ’planes
have been designed in Germany capable
of travelling at 500 miles a minute and
providing every comfort for customers,
including cocktail bars. It has been
proved mathematically that a rocket
’plane fired into the empyrean can be
so adjusted that it will stop at 30 miles
and become an asteroid, which will con-
tinue to career around the globe to all
eternity, or as long as eternity lasts, under
Professor Einstein’s rules. Such a con-
venience would be a means of escaping
from the winds of Wellington. T lost so
many hats in Wellington in my first six
months that I gave up wearing them.
But the matter goes further than that.
I read recently that in an Air Force
dress rehearsal over London it was
demonstrated that aggressors will win
over defenders in the next war, and
naturally in the present temper of
humanity every nation will be an aggres-
sor. A movement will soon arise, pro-
bably under private enterprise, to pro-
vide every country with its own asteroids.
The rich will avail themselves of the
facility first, but later, no doubt, poorer
citizens with a longing for the quiet life
will club together and have their own
asteroids. Fast rocket ’planes running
to schedule will convey tenants thither.
In due course a new race of strato-
sphereans will arise. There will be aste-
roid Renos where divorce laws will be
very liberal, asteroid Monte Carlos with
facilities for losing one’s money and
asteroidal summer resorts. If they have
learnt anything from earth experience the
stratosphereans will live under a Strato-
sphere League of Nations, and since it
will be practically impossible to over-
populate space, they will learn to live
peacefully, getting rid of their natural
belligerency in inter-asteroidal sporting
contests. To escape from boredom they
will all become writers, poets, painters,
sculptors or crossword-puzzle addicts.
A few eccentrics will still remain on
earth as cenobites or hermits, and when
stratosphereans die they will be buried
on the earth, for reasons of sentiment.
li Argo”: The honor that will be paid
to the name of Henty in the Victorian
centenary celebrations is evoking some
gloomy reflections among students of
Westralia’s early records about the poten-
tial pioneers it once had—and lost. For
it was the Peel Colonisation Scheme that
first brought the Henty family, quite a
wealthy one, to Australia, and they came
to the Swan River settlement in style.
Land under the Peel scheme was to
be allotted to immigrants in proportion
as they enriched the colony with
what they brought, and the Henty
family contributed, in addition to the old
man, seven stalwart sons, 33 servants and
laborers, four horned cattle, eight horses,
147 sheep and eight hogs, all apparently
from West Tarring, Sussex. With such a
hand as this they were able to claim and
obtain one of the biggest grants awarded.
But Peel’s scheme proved a sad fiasco,
and, apart from this, the quality of the
land didn’t impress the Henty patriarch.
So it was not long before he moved on to
Tasmania in search of “a more progres-
sive community and more congenial con-
ditions,” and gradually his sons followed
him, to make history on the other side
of the continent. What became of the
retainers is not stated, but such as could
probably moved on, too.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Melbourne ringmen continue to admit
that they “broke even on the day.” At
Caulfield on Saturday Laniroi, the least
fancied of 10 runners for the Australian
Hurdle, Seaveille excepted, came home
an easy winner, and took 3|sec. off the
race record by covering three miles and
a quarter and 20 yards in 6min. 2sec.
Previous best time was established by
Sir Alogy seven years ago. Sir Alogy
led all the way ; Laniroi scored by
superior stamina, which enabled him to
overtake Sarokos and outstay Ety-
mology.
Hynes, on Sarokos, drew out for a lead
of half a furlong, and for more than
two miles the grey jumped magnificently.
Along the railway side in the last circuit
he still held a commanding lead, but
Etymology and Laniroi were beginning
to run him down. A bad blunder at the
penultimate obstacle put Sarokos out of
court. It then looked as if victory might
go to Etymology; but as soon as the
straight was entered Laniroi drew away
from H. E. Connolly's candidate, and,
ridden out with the whip by N. Bracken,
the Lanius gelding scored by half a
dozen lengths. Mount Dangar (winner
of the A.J.C. Hurdle) and The Mirror
(favorite) found the journey too long.

dropped out before that with an injured
fetlock.
Laniroi belongs to Rupert Watson,
who bred him at Perricoota station, near
Echuca. In 1919 Lady Reigle, the dam
of Laniroi, finished second to Will Com-
fort in the V.R.C. G.N. Hurdle. She
was trained by the late Harry McCal-
man at Bendigo, where generations of
Watsons have been citizens. In the G.N.
Hurdle and on other • occasions this
season Laniroi fell, but B. Crocker, his
trainer, never lost faith in the gelding.
Going out at 25 to 1 he gave the book-
makers almost a skinner in straight-out
volumes, and from a doubles standpoint
the result was disastrous to punters.
Holt had five members of his power-
ful team on the course. Hall Mark and
Hyperion were not there to race, but
Folk Lore, Nuit d’Or and Panto each
had an outing under silk. Panto —who,
like Hyperion, hails from Westralia —
made his Victorian debut in the Malakoff
Stakes. Being backward in condition, he
received poor support, and shaped
accordingly. Heavy stable plunges were
made on Folk Lore and Nuit d’Or. The
former galloped rather unkindly in the
Mornington Welter for the greater part
of the journey, but put in a spectacular
finish and got second place. Folk Lore
was bred in France, her dam, Susie Pye,
having been sent there to be covered by
Great Legend after foaling in England
to an Australian service by Verbius.
Nuit d’Or ought not to have been
beaten in the Malakoff Stakes. He drew
a berth near the inner rails, and, through
not finding his legs quickly, got shut in
and was second-last five furlongs from
home. At the straight entrance Nuit d’Or
still was. a long way back, and he was
obliged to thread his way through the
field. Even under these disadvantages
he ran the winner, Gallibrook, to half
a head.
In the Australian Steeplechase Red-
ditch has 12st. 131 b., the impost he won
with 12 months ago ; and it would appear
that he needs only to stand up in order
to score again. Most of the horses left
in at the time of writing have never raced
over fences. Jack’s Jason landed the
Warrnambool Grand Annual Steeple-
chase of 1932. He met with an injury
subsequently and has not raced since. If
sound again. Jack’s Jason, might trouble
Redditch, but no other candidate can be
mentioned with an atom of confidence.

Sydney’s most consistent sprinter these
days is Prince Yamba, trained at Can-
terbury Park by his owner Tillman. This
black Cistercian gelding has now won
three races in succession. Opposed to a
good suburban field in the Flying Handi-
cap at Canterbury, Prince Yamba went
out at 7 to 1, Cid being a warm favorite.
Cid missed the jump, cannoned into
Leila Vale at the half-mile, and was
further delayed when young Lamb went
for a run on the rails at the top of the
straight. Knox moved Prince Yamba out
into the good going. He quickly closed
the gap, and Cid had to be eased
off the heels of the pacemaker. Cid
finished really well, to get within half
a length of the winner, and with ordi-
nary luck his backers would have col-
lected.
The backing of Multigris was absurd
in view of his recent racing over a mile.
He was at no stage in a winning position,
though he came home strongly.
Form pointed to Confab having a good
chance in the Canterbury Handicap, but
big support for Enamour (7 to 2), Wal-
lace Mimi and Eton Lady caused the
Magpie gelding to ease. Young Weiss
essayed to win all the way on Jack
Kelso’s charge. He tried to slow the
field down, but Eton Lady’s pilot had
evidently been instructed to keep him
going, and at the turn Eton Lady went
pas t fij m . she appeared to be going
easily at the Leger, but Enamour, who
had shown surprising dash all the way,
came fast on the outside, and beat Mal-
colm Mackellar’s mare in the last couple
of strides, with Semmak a poor third.
Baltimore (2 to 1) was set a severe task
to win the Ashbury Handicap of nine
furlongs. Drawing the outside position
at the barrier, he was hustled along, and
young Carter never let up on him until
the judge was reached. That he was able
to withstand a determined challenge from
Ramrod (4 to 1) over the last furlong
says much for his stamina. Darby Munro
actually got Ramrod in front for a time,
but Baltimore came again, and the result
was a dead-heat. Cockpen was third.
Baltimore is very fit, and is worth fol-
lowing.
Faraday, who cost Ike Andrews (War-
wick Farm trainer) 100 guineas, is prov-
ing a profitable purchase. Starting at
5 to 2, the son of Caravel —Jean Rox-
burgh~’won the Three-year-old in a walk
from Contact and Vandal. He is a
brother to Old Ming.
Backers picked both divisions of the
Maiden Stakes. In the first heat the
Maoriland-bred Deep Respect, who is
trained by J. T. Jamieson for C. B.
Quinan, was backed from 7 to 2 to 5 to 4.
The big chestnut —he looks more like a
’chaser than a sprinter—was all out to
beat an outsider, Lingo, with St. Globe
and Tilcian a dead-heat for third. In
the second heat Clear Gold (2 to 1) won
in really good style. She went to the
front in the second furlong, and finished
gamely to beat off Abb’s Lad and Blue-
ville. Clear Gold is raced and trained
by J. Alward, who had that fine sprinter
Malt Mary.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Rising 30 and beaten by several young-
sters of no celebrity before he came to
Australia in 1933, Tod Morgan has re-
gained championship form in this
country. Either that or our lightweights
are a poor lot. In the last few weeks the
veteran has licked Kelso, Tommy John
and Herb Bishop. He is now matched
with Carroll again.
* * * *
Tommy Nilan had two engagements
last week; he met George Penchiff at
Brisbane on Wednesday and Jack Clarke
at Leichhardt on Saturday. He lost on
each occasion, but these reverses matter
little in the wrestling game. It is show-
manship that counts.
Woodfull’s Men
Glamorgan is like the gentlemen in
the Bab Ballads—-it holds “liberal
opinions.” In winter it is a Welsh county
playing Rugby football, skipper Turnbull
being an international half-back. In
summer Glamorgan changes oyer' and
becomes a member of the English first-
class counties.
Woodfull again won the toss and
batted on what must have been an easy
wicket. His father’s death in Melbourne
kept Ponsford out, but the captain
showed quite dashing form, and was
228 n.o. at the end of the first day.
Kippax again scored with 77. At stumps
Australia had 440 up for 7 wickets.
Glamorgan bowling is weak. J. C. Clay,
a slow bowler who played for the Gentle-
men against the tourists earlier in the
season, took 3 for 124. Mercer, a veteran
professional, nailed 2 for 86.
(Continued on page 36.)
Foot brawl
The South Melbourne team that met
Carlton on Saturday was a different pro-
position from the one that went down by
3 points on May 12. Carlton is much
as it was then, but the Red-and-
Whites have been licked into a fast,
clever side. They took a while to size
up things, but when they got going Carl-
ton simply didn’t have a look-in. In
the third quarter South whipped on 13
goals to Carlton’s 3, and that was that
Pratt outshone all by kicking 11 goals—
he now has 104 for the season and pro-
mises to beat Gordon Coventry’s Vic-
torian record of 124. South 151,
Carlton 110, was the tale. Richmond
stepped into “the four” again by collect-
ing 67 to St. Kilda’s 38, but the Tigers
deserved to lose, 25 of their points being
for behinds. Collingwod kept its place
with 150 to Essendon’s 102; Fitzroy
outed Footscray, 78 to 72 ; Geelong made
a chopping-block of North, 123 to 42.
Melbourne found some difficulty in
downing Hawthorn, but ultimately man-
aged it by 3 points—76 to 73.
The fiftieth match between the N.S.W.
and All-Black Rugby Unions in Sydney
on Saturday provided a knock-back to
those who assert that the old international
kick-into-touch rule hopelessly slows up
the game compared with the professional
League version. Though there were
patches of dulness in the first half, the
match was generally so fast and open
that both sides were done to a crisp
when the All-Blacks walked off winners
by 18-16 as the result of a last-minute
try. The 27,000 spectators —a record for
the Union since the war—got their
money’s worth.
Two outstanding features of the game
were the ease with which M.L. won the
ball from the scrums and the number of
free kicks, mostly for offside, given
against the home team. The first gave
the excellent M.L. half-back line every
chance to show in the limelight. The
second lost N.S.W. some points and
might have lost more.
Neither side played entirely satisfac-
tory football. Both full-backs erred badly
on occasion. Collins bumped Cowper
after the latter had kicked over his head
and was racing to the line. A free kick,
or perhaps a penalty try, would not have
been out of place here. Ross presented
M.L. with 5 points by a feeble cross-
kick which Caughey gathered in an open
centrefield, sprinting on to score under
the posts unhampered. Caughey was
easily the best of the Black three-
quarter line. Bullock-Douglas and Hart
were well held by White and Kelaher,
and both these wingers scored, White
breaking through his opposite number’s
tackle for a sensational try. Towers was
ineffective for the most part at centre,
and was mastered by Caughey (he im-
proved in the return match). Cowper began
sensationally, but faded out as the game
went on. Page and Griffiths gave both
a lot of trouble, as was the case with
Primrose, who mulled many transfers
from Richards, though these were not
always perfect in the first spell, when the
half rarely saw the ball at his side of the
scrum. Kilby, on the other hand, had
everything made to order for him. He
and Page gave a splendid exhibition.
Each side lost a forward. Walden,
who relieved Perrin, played a stout game,
as did McKenzie, who came on in place
of Mahoney. Knight, Max and Mataira
were a great trio of forwards. Hodgson,
Cerutti and White did honest work for
N.S.W. The winners scored 3 tries, 1
converted by Collins, who added a p.g.,
and a field goal by Kilby. Kilby,
Caughey and Bullock-Douglas crossed
the line. Scorers for N.S.W. were Kela-
her, Mackney, Louden and W. White.
Ross converted two tries.
M.L. won the second match, 16-13.
**' * *
The Rugby League club games in
Sydney at the week-end were obscured
by the big Union match, but the out-
come was that Eastern and Western
Suburbs now top the table with 24 points
each, and must play off next Saturday
for the minor premiership and the right
to challenge for the final. Eastern Sub-
urbs had a far-from-easy win from New-
town by 23-17. Western made a better
job of Northern, which was wiped out
by 26-10. South Sydney got home from
Balmain by 18-12, while St. George pre-
vailed over University by 17 to 5.
* * * *
A try and converting goal three
minutes before time gave King’s an 8-6
victory over St. Joseph’s and the Sydney
G.P.S. football premiership.
(i Continued on page 36.)
Saturday saw the opening of the Em-
pire Games in London, the only Aus-
tralian winner being Metcalfe, who put
up a British record of 50ft. The
run-up was very rough, having been cut
up a few days before by a rodeo, other-
wise it is likely the N.S.W. athlete would
have equalled the world’s figures by
Japanese Chuhei Nambu at Los Angeles,
which are a foot better. Sweeney, of
England, won the 100 in lOsec., and
the 440 hurdles went to Hunter, of Scot-
land, in 55 l-ssec.

Under the Whip
“Richmond”: Satisfied that the de-
presh has lifted, the V.R.C. has notified
some of the Melbourne racing clubs that
the permission granted them some time
ago to prune stake-money has been can-
celled. For the new season programmes
for all meetings in the suburban radius
on Saturdays or public holidays must
carry not less than £l3OO prize-money
spread over not more than six races.
Owners who show mostly at the minor
meetings in and about Sydney would
welcome some action of the sort by the
A.J.C. Prizes given by some of the pro-
prietary clubs hardly leave enough to
pay the blacksmith when nomination and
acceptance fees, with other trifles, are
deducted.
* * * *
“Ike Mcßagg”: Victorian racing ad-
dicts are chortling over a hint from the
Government that a reduction of betting
taxes will be an item in the next Budget.
Unofficially it is stated that the punter's
tax will be wiped out. This rises from Is.
on bets between £5 and £lO to 10s. on
wagers over £250. The tax paid by bag-
men may be cut by half. At present it
ranges from sixpence to a penny per
ticket on the metropolitan courses, and
from threepence to a penny outside the
20-mile radius. There is a catch in it, of
course. To make up the lost revenue
the amusement tax on admission tickets
is to be bumped up.
* * V *
• “Retired Urger” : Colin Stephen, chair-
man of the A.J.C., had a chat with
owners, trainers and jockeys last week
on the amended rules of racing which
came into force on August 1. They have
been adopted by all the leading clubs,
though in some localities local rules will
still be permitted. One of the important
changes lays down that a jockev or ap-
prentice taking a cash or other gift,
from anyone for riding without the con-
sent of the owner may be fined, sus-
pended or disqualified as the club de-
cides. Another definitely establishes the
power of the club to suspend, warn oft
or disqualify—a power recently chal-
lenged in the N.S.W. courts —any owner
or trainer who by advertising or cir-
cularising offers information concerning
his own or other people’s horses for a
fee. Owners tacitly conniving also come
under the rule.
* * * *
“Eagle Farm”: There was a mild sen-
sation at the annual meeting of the
Q.T.C. when J. F. McGill moved that
the club request the Government to
legalise shop betting under license.
McGill stated that investigations showed
that there were 600 recognised shops
operating under the cush in Brisbane.
If the Q.T.C. could get the right to
license them at £2 each a meeting, there
would be a nice jump in revenue every
race day. McGill added that he knew the
Ministry, with one exception, was in
favor of licensing. F. A. Cooper, Assist-
ant Treasurer, has denied this.
Woodfull’s Men
With one day cut out through rain,
Australia’s match with Scotland at Edin-
burgh ended in a draw. The tourists
carried their score from 3 for 144 to
331, and closed with 5 wickets down.
In its second innings Scotland doggedly
resisted all attempts to rout it, and saved
the situation by having 116 up at the
fateful hour, and two wickets still to
fall. The Australian innings saw some
bright batting by McCabe (73), Kippax
(90 n. 0.) and Barnett (92). Anderson
(3-99) was Scotland’s most successful
trundler.
Gloucester, where the cheeses and
dukes come from, was Australia’s oppo-
nent after Scotland. Rain docked a day,
and the game ended in a draw. Wood-
full staggered cricket humanity by win-
ning the toss at last, and ran up a good
131 himself. Ponsford was unusually
stodgy for 54, but Kippax (50) and Mc-
Cabe (61) were batting freely when
the closure came down at 2 for 308.
Hammond’s 61 was. the outstanding
feature of Gloucester’s 184. Fleet-
wood-Smith, to whom he had adminis-
tered some unmerciful hidings in Aus-
tralia, clean-bowled him. Smith took
7 for 40, thus keeping up his run of good
performances in recent matches.
:{c * sj: *
“Hotham”: Good to note that the
Imperial cricket conference in London
has hurled out the Australian Board of
Control’s fool rule giving umpires the
right to “order off” a bowler they may
suspect of bodyline intentions. It has
emphasised, however, that “bowling
which is obviously a direct attack by the
bowler upon the batsman would be an
offence against the spirit of the game and
should not be permitted or countenanced
by controlling bodies of cricket.” Tours
have been arranged as far ahead as 1942.
H= * * *
"Vieux Marcheur”: The older mem-
bers of Marylebone have been rocked to
their boot heels by the decision of the
committee to raise the membership from
6000 to 7000. The entrance fee is only
live guineas, and the annual sub. three,
so there will be no trouble in getting
members. It is worth noting, however,
that the most exclusive of all the Eng-
lish clubs—leaving out some of the uni-
versities with their limited membership—
charges no entrance fee at all, while its
subscription is the same as the entrance

fee. That is I Zingari, the guarded battle-
ments of which even the mighty “W.G.”

* * * *
“Stoomps”: England thus far has
batted 17 players in Test matches this
season, but it is a long way behind the
record panic which hit the selectors when
the 1921 Australian XI was in England
and a regiment of 29 was called to
face the fast battery of McDonald and
Jack Gregory. The English selectors also
had the “jumps” badly in 1909, and used
25 different players against “Tibby"
Cotter, Armstrong and Frank Laver.
Australia won both series of Tests.
* * * *
“Kennington”: There is a note of
pathos in the retirement of Hobbs from
county cricket after 32 seasons with
Surrey. John says that he has hung on in
the hope of completing 200 centuries in
first-class cricket —he already has 197 up
—but the Surrey committee has shown
signs of impatience for some time.
Hobbs may yet get his wish. He has
been picked to play with an English
Eleven against Australia at Folkestone in
September, and he has a chance for
another Players v. Gentlemen match or
two, to say nothing of M.C.C. teams
against the counties and universities —all
first-class fixtures.
* * * *
"Mat”: When the final Test is waged
at the Oval on August 18 there will be
some long-standing, musty records made
on that ground to tilt at. Three of Eng-
land’s Test wicket partnerships were put
up there —151 for the fourth (Fry and
Jackson in 1905), 170 for the sixth (Sut-
cliffe and Wyatt in 1930) and 151 for
the ninth (W. W. Read and Scotton in
1884). Australia’s two records are 180
for the first (Bardsley and Syd Gregory
in 1909) and 243 for the fourth (Bradman
and Jackson in 1930). The best aggregate
of wickets on that strip of earth for
Australia was F. R. Spofforth’s 14 for
90 (7 for 46 and 7 for 44) in 1882, before
any of the present players was born ;
and for England, F. Martin’s bag of 12
for 102 (6 for 50 and 6 for 52) in 1890.
was Martin’s only Test appearance,
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Patsy Hendren’s score
of 60 in a county match brought his tally
of runs in first-class cricket to 50,000.
Only “W.G.,” Hobbs and Mead had
hitherto scaled such Olympian heights.
* * *
“Quack"’: An English doctor has
added his voice to the chorus of cricket
fatuity now raging in England. He notes
with apprehension that Wall has a habit
of rubbing the ball against his “short
ribs” as he walks back to make his next
delivery. The medico advances the
theory that the continual rubbing may
set up irritation that in time might cause
a dangerous growth.
Footbrawl
“Fitzcray”: The life of the Melbourne
football umpire continues to be full of
tribulation. First of all, the League sus-
pended for the season three of them
adjudged accessories or something to the
notorious Carlton-Collingwood box-on.
Next Saturday, after a match between
Williamstown and Northcote (Ass.), a line
umpire was kicked by the crowd and the
central ump. had to be escorted off by
John Hops. They couldn’t have hopped
quickly enough, for the unhappy official
got a good belting in a mix-up outside the
dressing-room, during which he was
stabbed by a lady with a hatpin. This
has been a favorite practice with fair
barrackers in Melbourne, umbrellas being
used alternatively to hatpins in these
shingled days. It has been estimated that
if every Melbourne umpire stabbed with
gingham or pin during the past few years
were laid end to end the line would reach
from Heidelberg to Cape Otway.
* * * *
“Northcote”: The Victorian F.A. (Aus-
tralian Rules) is very worried over its
gradual but steady decline in the face of
League competition. As an instance, at
two senior matches the other day the
takings totalled £7 in each case, one los-
ing club getting 2s. 9d. One of the Associa-
tion’s troubles is that its clubs are scat-
tered round Melbourne, while the League
is concentrated in the central area, a fact
that makes for economic working. A
committee is to consider a proposal that
its clubs be split into two sections, north
and south of the Yarra. It is expected
that this plan would cut costs and stimu-
late local interest. That could be further
fanned by semi-finals and finals between
the leading clubs from north and south
at the end of the season.
“Te Kooti”: Isn’t it about time that
the timeworn All-Black practice of giv-
ing a “haka” was walloped on the head
with a mere ? The thing was invented by
the M.L. Native team of 1888.1 saw them
playing Surrey in their opening match at
Richmond, and to an audience rather
bored with Gilbert and Sullivan and
Gaiety burlesque it was quite entertain-
ing, though it soon palled. The years
have made me sicker and sicker of the
foolish caper. A Maoriland relative tells
me that none of the teams he has known,
including the present one, have the re-
motest conception of what the words
they bellow mean. M.L.’s football repu-
tation needs no variety-show enrichment.
* * * *
“Manakau”: Auckland Rugby Union
recently put out a feeler for a visit from
the senior Sydney club of the season.
It was suggested that the winning Auck-
land club might come across next year
and that return trips become an annual
affair. All expenses were offered, and it
was suggested that three matches be
played. The Ma R.U. has turned down
the proposition. The premier club could
not leave Sydney until September 15 or
22. Also the likelihood of an adequate
financial return from a visit of Auck-
landers to Sydney is a remote one.
“Gate”: A feature of the Rugby
League match between Western Suburbs
and St. George was a presentation to the
Western full-back, Frank McMillan, on
the occasion of his 150th game with the
club. In addition to his club football

Mac has represented N.S.W. umpteen
times and has taken the trip to England
with two lots of Rugby League Kan-
garoos. If, in all that long story, he has
ever been found guilty of playing rough
or unfair football, writer, for one, has
never heard of it.

“Whistle”: Yet another injustice to
umpires. Recently one of these officials
sent a player off the field. The man was
penalised but later restored to full play-
ing rights. Against this the ump.
appealed, pleading that the latest deci-
sion absolutely stultified his action, as it
undoubtedly did. The potentates in
charge told him that he had no right to
make an appeal of the kind. Yet any
blackguard on the playing field who half
kills another has that right.
* * * *
“Stand off”: Leaving the All-Blacks
out of the question, August will be a
busy Rugby Union month. On August
11 Victoria and South Australia are
to meet in Adelaide in a return
match. The Vies, narrowly won the
first engagement of the season in Mel-
bourne, and the Croweaters swear that
this time they will go home with their
tails between their legs. A little later
the Australian Universities will hold
their annual tourney in Melbourne. The
show begins August 21 and lasts 10 days.
Ma is the holder of the championship.
The Nineteenth Hole
“On the Nail”: The stick-up of the
proposed visit from a team of American
professional golfers owing to delay in
raising the brass has been ended. The
Victorians and a Sydney club raised
£lOOO between them, and a long silence
followed waiting for the N.S.W. golf
heads to unbutton. They have proved as
responsive as a mausoleum, but a Sydney
business firm has jumped into the breach
with the amount needed to make up the
£1250 guarantee asked by the Yanks. Six
players have been invited, and their
special job will be cleaning up the £3OOO
of prize-money offering at the Melbourne
centenary tourney beginning November
15. They will also show in Sydney in
an international match.
X X X X
“Brassey”: N.S.W. golfers, who are
handling the Australian championships
in Sydney shortly, are still arguing over
whether to charge admission or not. The
show will be staged at Royal Sydney’s
course at Rose Bay, where there should
be no trouble about putting the
acid on spectators. Further, charging
for admission to the amateur cham-
pionships in Sydney for the past two sea-
sons has cut out a big percentage of the
unruly crowds that have more than once
proved a nuisance. Tn Britain, admission
charges are now the rule, even crusted
old St. Andrews having fallen into line.

“Carnoustie”: The statement that your
Briton is a much more inveterate punter
on cricket and other field games than the
Australian (B. 25/7/’34) is amply borne
out by the betting odds quoted in a batch
of English papers describing the open
golf championship. There was an entry
of over 300, and many of the aspirants
were admittedly hopeless duds. Most of
the big British bagmen operated, and,
British fashion, posted the odds periodi-
cally during the meeting. Prices were
wide open where most of the known
duffers were concerned, the general quote
being 1000 to 1 and no takers.

“Shirley”: Australian and M.L. golfer-
ettes will battle for this year’s Tasman
Cup in Maoriland. The M.L. girls lifted
the pot in the first match at Melbourne
last year, but the decision was hardly a
fair one, since, after playing the morning
round, three of the Australian starters
could not play in the foursome in the
afternoon, all going down with ’flu.
Australia put up Mrs. Russell and Miss
Lefebvre as an emergency pair, and they
were only just beaten. The other match
went by forfeit, and though the matches
were even the cup went to M.L.
“Hoylake”: Australia is to get a team
of amateur golfers, and a pretty hot one,
too. Michael Scott will be player-skipper,
and the others are Bourn, Garnett and
Jock McLean. McLean last week won
the Scottish title for the third successive
year, and is one of the finest amateur
players on deck. Scott’s record in Aus-
tralia, where he lived for years, needs
no stressing. Bourn has won the English
close championship, and has played for
England against Scotland. Garnett is a
mighty driver who recently made a great
showing in the British amateur cham-
pionship.
* ❖ * *
“Baffy”: A well-known Australian
tennis player of other days, H. A. Parker,
won fresh laurels in England lately by
taking the Lucifer Society’s Empire golf
trophy at Walton Heath. Parker has the
unique distinction of having won the
tennis singles championship of every
Australian State. He kicked off with
Tassie in 1904, and took the Westralian
title two years later, as well as that of
Queensland. Victoria and South Aus-
tralia were added to his bag in 1907, and
in 1910 he carried off the N.S.W. cham-
pionship.
“Divot Digger”: Now that the N.S.W.
golf championships are over we get the
usual squeal about the conditions being un-
fair. This year the Ma crowd followed the
example of other golfing countries, seed-
ing the draw and including the quarter-
finals in the last stages of match play.
The objectors want a reversion to the old
qualifying rounds of stroke. They claim
that the average entrant doesn’t get a
fair game under match conditions. There
is something in that, but is it worth
worrying about? The qualifying-round
system gave a run to a lot of foredoomed
duds who did nothing more than hang
up the meeting. To players of this type
match play is anathema. What they
want is 36 holes of stroke to qualify and
then, with 32 players left in, 36-hole
matches to decide the issue. That means
“Great work, Lionel. Next round hop in and finish him.”
that at least some of the qualifiers will
get their names in the papers.
* *
“Divot Digger”: Having been assured
that a team of English golfers will land
at Fremantle on October 16, the Aus-
tralian G.U. has rushed in with an
itinerary for the visitors which can only
be described as preposterous. The team
is asked to play a match against West-
ralia on landing, and is then to be
whisked some 2000 miles across the con-
tinent in six days, with a match against
Queensland on October 22. On Novem-
ber 3 and 5 there is an international
match in Sydney, with another against
the State on November 6. Then off to Mel-
bourne for an international and a State
match, this last on November 13. From
November 15-25 the visitors will have
to plough through the special centenary
meeting. Two games in Tassie and one
in Adelaide will complete a pretty toil-
some tour. The thing will have to be
altered, of course. Apart from the feel-
ings of the visitors, the programme
clashes with the N.S.W. close champion-
ship.
“Susie Swattit”: Australian golt'erettes
open their championships early in Sep-
tember, beginning with a match between
N.S.W. and Victoria at Rose Bay. Next
day qualifying rounds of 36 holes medal
will be played, 16 to qualify. The entry
reads a very strong one. Maoriland has
nominated the Kay and Gaisford girls,
now returning from Europe, while Vic-
toria has a big entry of champions and
ex-champions. Miss Perry represents
Tassie,'and she also is a State titleholder.
Racquet and Bawl
England retained the Davis Cup by
beating America at Wimbledon by 4
rubbers, 18 sets, 118 games to 1 rubber,
7 sets, 92 games. After taking the open-
ing singles, the Cup-holders decided to
throw Hughes and Lee to the American
doubles lions, Lott and Stoeffen. It was
good tactics, for the rested singles players
mopped up their games on the third day.
Shields gave Perry a great go, the last
of four sets running 15-13 in the Eng-
lishman’s favor. Austin downed Wood
by three sets to one.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: An interesting yarn
about the Australian-American Davis
Cup tie at Wimbledon tells how, after
Shields and Wood had been beaten by
Crawford and McGrath in the first two
singles, Lott and Stoeffen booked pas-
sages to sail for America late on the
third day of the match. Their reason
was that they did not give Wood a hope
of beating Crawford after the way
McGrath handled him. They under-
estimated the in-and-out form which has
so often distinguished our players, and
survived to win the tie and challenge the
Cup-holders.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: Australian tennis players
in Europe are now scattered all over the
shop. Crawford and his wife are to
see the fifth Test at the Oval. Joan Harti-
gan and Mrs. Hopman will chase some
European tennis tourneys in Switzerland
before heading for home at the end of
September. The others, with the excep-
tion of manager Youdale, who remains in
his native land, are expected to clear
Europe by August 31, except Queens-
lander Mrs. Molesworth, who stays on
until October 3. The Bananaland and
Australian champion of the past has had
a very disappointing season, and evi-
dently couldn’t get acclimatised.
X X X X
“Cut Shot”: The conference in Lon-
don of the Davis Cup nations ended in
a deadlock over the question of wiping
out the new qualifying-round system,
only begun last year. The voting in
favor of returning to the old “all-in”
style was 16-6, but that didn’t give the
statutory two-thirds majority. Those
nations which failed to vote have been
allowed five months to cast their ballot.
The other burning question, the proposal
to make the Cup contest biennial, was
also shelved for the same reason. Dwight
Davis, donor of the Cup, bitterly opposed
it, but-there was a strong vote in its
favor. Australia, with the proposer.
South Africa, should fight for the change
tooth and nail.
“Canny Lad”: Some of the English
papers have been making a fuss because
of “insults” hurled at ex-shamateurs by
the All-England L.T.C. Cochet, once a
life member of the club, asked for a free
ticket to Wimbledon. He was naturally
told that his life membership of an
amateur club lapsed when he became a
paid player. Tilden and Suzanne Leng-
len were also turned down, and had to
pay. Hence howls and charges of snob-
bery. One might just as well accuse the
Rugby Union of snobbery because it re-
fused recognition to a player who had
abandoned its amateur ranks for one of
the paid football games.
❖ X X X
“Cash Amateur”: The meeting of the
International L. T. Federation in Lon-
don threw out the proposal that amateurs
and professionals should be allowed to
play together—with such emphasis that it
is never likely to be repeated. Exhibition
matches between the lilywhites and the
other coves may be allowed, “but only
after the closest scrutiny and the written
permission of the Federation.” Since
many amateurs have for years “been
living at the expense of various coun-
tries,” travelling and living expenses may
be drawn for only two months in each
year, though overseas touring teams are
specially exempted. The new laws date
from January 1, 1935. They read well,
but anyone with an inside knowledge of
the game can see that “eight weeks'
allowance period being manipulated by
tournament officials and other interested
parties.
"Roland”: France has turned the cold
shower on the centenary tourney. The
president of the French L.T.A. has an-
nounced that individual players will not
be allowed to tour abroad. Boussus was
listed to come, but, unless he can get
a good offsider acceptable to the Mel-
bourne crowd, he must stay at home.
* * *
“Brass Addler”: Another attempt is to
be made by professional tennis to cap-
ture the English public. Undeterred by
the previous flop, when even the Lenglen
failed to draw enough to pay the band,
the Tilden circus is to open at Wembley
next month. The players comprise
Tilden, Vines, Richards, Ramillion, Plaa,
Cochet, Maskel and Kozeluh —a hot lot.
If the experiment is a success, the circus
will proceed to clean up England as it
has done the U.S.A.
Miscellaneous
“Sprocket”: The long-drawn-out Tour
de France ended with Antonin Magne
winner .he second
time. Magne’s riding
time for the 2695 miles
in 23 stages was 147 hr.
13min. 58sec. He has
been negotiating with
Opperman to team with
him in 1935 in a new
race called the Tour de
France Individuelle.
This will be over 2100
miles, one man riding
and the other resting
on alternate days, as in
six-day races. There is
£1650 for first place
alone.
He
The annual meeting
- of the N.S.W.C.A. dis-
closed a loss on last
season of £2179. As
there was a surplus for
the previous year of
£5052 following on the
English tour, there is still a shot in the
locker in addition to accumulated funds
of £33,884. Sydney Smith, as usual, made
an effective speech. For one thing he
roundly condemned the present hole-
and-corner method of granting testi-
monial matches to Dick and Tom, and
leaving Harry out in the cold. Smith
backed an insurance scheme to cover all
representative players. Nearly everyone
took a kick at the Board of Control over
its notorious bodyline cables and the
messing-up of the team asked for by
Maoriland, so it can be seen that a good
time was had by all.
X' X ❖ X
“Mat”: There has been a terrible up-
heaval in Sydney bowls circles over a
proposal that mixed competitions be per-
mitted as in tennis. Individual clubs in
Sydney have found mixed matches a
great success, and that is also the case in
other Australian capitals, especially Mel-
bourne, where mixed bowls is an
accepted fact. The diehards of .Sydney
will have none of it, however. Ex-
president John Scott told an interviewer
that he had no objection to women play-
ing as long as they kept to themselves.
He hoped that amalgamation would
never come about. The well-liked
’Shoreman has expressed the feelings of
a big majority of the older bowlers, those
in favor of the amalgamation being
mostly callow youths of not more than
50 or so. What these say is that the old
boys are scared of being beaten by the
girls, but this can be taken as calumny.
“Wanganui”: According to a Maori-
land visitor to the annual meet of the
N.S.W.R.A., it is likely that the All-
Black eight booked for Henley-on-Yarra
in November will row in Sydney after
its splash in Melbourne. It. would
add an attraction to a rowing season
which promises to be a bumper, since, in
addition to other big events, the Aus-
tralian rowing and sculling champion-
ships will be held on the Nepean.
“Fitzcray”: The big billiard battle
between Walter Lindrum and Joe Davis
for the world’s championship has at last
been nailed down. Walter will begin to
defend his title at the Victorian Rail-
ways Institute hall in Melbourne on Sep-
tember 24. Before that comes off, the
pair will play a fortnight’s exhibition
match at the Tivoli billiards hall, Mel-
bourne, beginning August 13. When it
is all over, Davis expects to return to
England via Maoriland, where Clark
McConachv will run him round for a
bit.


BUSINESS, ROBBERY, ETC.
What Now?
One ot those businessmen who, during
the slump, found that there was more
money to be made on the Stock Ex-
change than in their customary callings
was reviewing things on the kerb
in Pitt-street, Sydney. “Gold market
seems very flat lately, doesn’t it? I’m
hanging on to my Sulphides. The fever’s
blown over for the time being, that’s all.
The outlook for the metal’s better than
ever. Things’ll brighten up again with
a rush shortly. Funny how Consols have
taken a leap ; some went to £ll3 yester-
day.”
“How is the building trade looking
alter you these days?” his friend asked.
"Well, it is a business once again,” he
replied. “I’m satisfied things are defi-
nitely recovering.” “What about wool
prices ; think there’ll be a relapse in trade
when the effect of the big cheques for the
last clip wears off?” “I’m not worrying
much. Wool went too high last year, but
it showed people that there is hope of-
recovery. It gave confidence, and that
counts for nearly as much as the price
itself. No ; I’m not worrying much about
wool. But if Lang got back, then I
would be concerned. Wheat’s looking
more hopeful. Hang on to your good
shares. Cheerio.”
Morning and afternoon in every Big
City little groups of investors and
punters stand around the Stock Ex-
change sales-board or outside in the
sun and compare notes. Each helps
to keep the other in touch ; they
are usually interested in the same
stocks. When a man whose judgment
has proved sound in the past passes by
he is usually hailed and drawn into the
group.
Wool and gold are the main topics at
present. Then there was last week’s re-
markable rise in Consols, opposed to
which were weaknesses in both the gold-
and industrial-share markets. The buoy-
ancy in fixed-interest-bearing securities
suggests uncertainty as to the future of
business concerns ; the yield to the in-
vestor on Consols is down to a new low
level, and that means idle money is still
piling up. Even when wool was rising
Consols kept mounting ; the recovery in
trade was not enough to attract capital
into new industries.
When most of the June 30 balance
sheets of public companies are available
—only a few have dribbled along so far
—the market may make up its mind
about industrial shares one way or the
other. Peters’ Ice Cream and several
Sydney hotel cos. had much better years
for the last 12 months, and that means
that the public is spending more. So far
the man in the street is keeping his
spirits up. Unemployment is lower
than at any time since 1930. Many
motor-car importers are unable to cope
with the demand for new vehicles, though
in this line a rush for replacements was
due to come sooner or later.
Meanwhile idle money is embarrassing
both banks and investors. Those con-
cerns which can see possibilities of
extending their businesses —and employ-
ing more people—now have a golden
opportunity of raising money cheaply.
Wheat
Wheat rose to 3s. Bd. in Sydney last
week, the best price for a long while.
Overseas markets are firm, partly be-
cause of the severe drought in U.S.A.
America will have to draw on some of
her huge reserves of grain this year;
such stocks, in U.S.A. and elsewhere,
have cast a shadow over the world’s
markets for several seasons. On May
12 there was 30 million bushels stored
in N. S. Wales silos. On July 7 the
figure had dropped to 25 million, and it
has since gone lower.
Last week’s higher prices came along
about the same time as the first report
of the Wheat Commission. It pointed out
that 50 p.c. of wheatgrowers need to get
3s. a bushel at sidings to show a margin
(others require up to 3s. lid.), and recom-
mended relief to the extent of £4,000,000
on the basis of 3s. a bushel at ports ;
funds to be provided partly by an excise
tax and partly from consolidated revenue.
As prices rise or fall the extent of the
relief might be adjusted.
As supplementary aid, a regulated
home-consumption price is recommended.
Chief examples of such schemes operating
m the Commonwealth at present are the
Government's sugar-purchase scheme
and the butter-stabilisation plan which
succeeded the Paterson scheme. As far
as producers of sugar and butter are con-
cerned, the regulated price has been a
big help.
But roughly half of our production of
those two commodities is used in Aus-
tralia. The average local consumption of
wheat, seed included, is a little over 51
million bushels a year, which is less than
a third of our total 1933-34 harvest and
about a quarter of the previous season's
crop.
The achievement of results as good
as those of the sugar and butter schemes
would not be so easy. To make much
difference to the total return to the
grower the local price would have to be
loaded more heavily, and bread is dear
already. But the commission mentions
that Australians have been getting their
wheat at about a shilling a bushel less
than the landed cost of grain from over-
seas if it were duty free. Prices of most
other Australian commodities —prices
which the wheatgrower has to pay —are
above world parity.
The commission points out that help
given to the wheatgrower will be re-
flected in secondary and retail industries.
Farmers are becoming disheartened in the
great fight they have put up to retain
their properties, and plant in many
cases is rapidly wearing out. Debts of
growers are estimated at £140,000,000 ;
replacement of necessary machinery
would run into £10.000,000.
“Yes, it’s a beauty, isn’t it? I tried it on the radiator-cap and was pinched
three times for glaring lights.”
Power for the Speck’s West Coast
“H.C.”: Tas. Government has signed
a contract to supply the Electrolytic Zinc
Co. at Rosebery with electric power, and
a line will be carried at once from the
central Waddamana station along the
West Coast road to Queenstown. Power
line already extends from Queenstown
to Zeehan, thence on to Rosebery,
and the Mt. Lyell Co. has been under
contract the last few years to supply
juice from Lake Margaret to these two
centres.
Lyell in the near future will either want
every watt of power it can produce or
none at all; so it can’t handle Rosebery
any longer. The present scheme is a good
one, since, if unhappily Lyell does have to
close down, its power stations will be
linked up with the State system and be
available elsewhere. Negotiations between
the Government and E.Z. have been
going on for some time, and probably
the Government made every effort to
induce E.Z., as a condition of supply, to
undertake the operation of the mines.
Unfortunately this condition has not
been secured, but E.Z. is pledged to pay
enough for power, whether used or not,
to recoup the Government in 15 years.
E.Z. can secure zinc concentrates from
Broken Hill cheaper than it could pro-
duce at Rosebery. But it is a sad sight
to see a splendid plant idle, three good
mines practically dead, and a small city
of empty houses. The gold in the Her-
cules ore should almost pay exes, to-day.
Adobe Houses for Unemployed
“A.H.”: The building of homes for
unemployed might take an unusual as
well as a useful turn if some examples
could be shown of the wattle-and-daub
houses built by inexperienced pioneer
settlers. Some of these remain in the
Kurrajong (N.S.W.) and on the Darling
Downs (Q.), where the Leslies built their
first stables and homes in this way. Other
old homes on the Downs and farther
west in Queensland are in as good order
as when built. These houses stand wear
and tear better than wood, they
regulate temperature better, and are much
more picturesque, besides which they cost
much less —in fact, cost is almost
negligible. The clay, well wattled, is
picturesque, but the rough-cast mud
bricks are equally effective and less
trouble.
Australia might develop a type of
house for the workman more fitted to our
climate than the ugly wooden shacks
which mar the landscape in so many
places. The adobe houses of S. America
are on the same principle as the wattle-
and-daub. If the construction of such
were seriously considered, building
clubs might be started, and bands of
builders organised. Probably there would
be a rush of men, for the great majority
of Australian unemployed are not lazy
loungers trying to dodge work. They are
eager for anything that will bring their
soul-destroying idleness to an end.
Part of the old Bungarrabee House, a
fine old model of colonial architecture,
was built of mud bricks. Another old
home near Careening Bay, Sydney, was
of the same material. This latter has
been covered with a coat of cement, and
is now a very handsome home, though
more like the old manor houses of Surrey
than an Australian residence.
“L.C.”: In Melbourne we can beat the
price for forestry bonds mentioned by
“4 x 2” (B. 25/ 7 /’34) by £3. A con-
cern whose educative forestry endeavors
have been described in The Bulletin
is now giving an advanced course. It
sells its section “A’s,” representing trees
planted in 1926, for £75, and its “cen-
tenary campaign” is meeting with con-
siderable success. You pay £5 down, the
balance at 2s. 6d. a week. Work it out
for yourself when the bonds will be paid
off.
After jazzing wildly for a week follow-
ing the introduction of ethylised spirit,
petrol prices in Sydney and Melbourne
are back where they were a fortnight
ago. Ethyl is now Is. 7d., first-grade (in-
cluding Purr Pull) Is. 6d., second Is. sd.
* * * *
The British Government’s proposal to
restrict imports of Dominion beef is tak-
ing more definite shape, and doesn’t look
quite the bogey it first appeared. Latest
proposal for Australia’s quota is a quan-
tity 5 p.c. greater than 1931-32 ship-
ments. This would tie us down to
1,346,000 centals of beef and 1,655,000
of mutton a year—about 162,000 and
53,000 centals respectively less than our
actual exports to Britain during the year
to June 30. Particularly since provision
has just been made for Australia’s entry
into the London chilled-meat trade, any
kind of restriction will be resented ; but
if this quota is adopted we will be
allowed to export more meat than we did
during the first year of the Ottawa agree-
ment. Whatever scheme eventually
operates, it will have to come up for
review in Britain early next year, when
the present plan for subsidising British
beefgrowers expires.
* * H= *
Uncle Sam reckons that the Ottawa
agreement has affected his sales to the
British Empire, and export figures sup-
port him. Though total exports were
slightly greater in 1933 than in 1932,
the Empire took only 37.9 p.c. of them,
as against 40 p.c. in 1932. Australia
bought 2 p.c. less from the U.S. and sold
65 p.c. more. The general balance of
Empire trade, however, was still con-
siderably in Sam’s favor.

At present the Melbourne S.S. Co.’s
only passenger vessel is the Dimboola.
In about August next year this old-timer
is to take a back seat; the Duntroon,
now on the stocks at Newcaslle-on-Tyiie,
will then enter the Sydney-Fremantle run.
Like most of Australia’s new coastal
liners the Duntroon is a motor vessel;-
of 10,000 tons gross, she will have a ser-
vice speed of 17 knots. The Adelaide
and ; Mcllwraith-McEachern cos. are also
having new vessels of similar size and
type built in Britain. There must be
something in coastal shipping after all.
* * * *
Under the Navigation Act Amending
Bill the permission granted to overseas
steamers to carry passengers between the
mainland and Tasmania is made statu-
tory, and any British ship of not less
than 10,000 tons and a speed of 14
knots or more is to be allowed to carry
passengers between Australian ports not
connected by railway— i.e., from Gerald-
ton (W.A.) north and east to Cairns
(N.Q.). But Parliament expired without
passing the measure.

One of Thring’s cos., Efftee Attrac-
tions, is to build another theatre in Syd-
ney at a cost of £lOO,OOO. It will seat
1700, and musical productions will be
staged.
* * * *
Judge Dethridge in the Arbitration
Court last week indicated .his intention
to grant substantially the theatrical em-
ployees’ application for higher wages in
accordance with cost-of-living figures.
J. C. Williamson’s representative in court
said the business was in a parlous con-
dition. The re-erection of His Majesty’s
in Melbourne had been done on bor-
rowed money. Two recent plays had
shown a little profit, but the loss on
“Gay Divorce” more than wiped this
out. Another witness said Fullers
Theatres had not paid a div. for five
years, nor Hoyts for three. According
to the union’s representatives girl ticket-.
sellers get 4s. 2d. a night and take the
risk of having to make up for bad coins.
* il: $
The need for compulsory third-party
motor-car insurance in N.S.W., as pro-
posed in Vic., was shown in a Sydney
bankruptcy case the other day. O. F.
Weight attributed his insolvency to a
judgment for £4OO obtained against him
in connection with a motor accident
where a little girl was injured. He was
not insured, and couldn’t pay the
damages.

“E.S.”: Years ago Jabez Wright (then
M.L.A.) advocated locking Lake Menin-
die, which is filled with the flooding of
the Darling and empties as the river re-
cedes, and laying a 10-mile pipe-line to
connect with Lake Cawndilla, where the
land grows great grapes and oranges.
Nothing has been done. Lake Menindie
has an area of 38,000 acres, and feeds
Lakes Cawndilla (same size), Pam-
ameroo (17,000 acres), Tandura (750),
Speculation (20,000) and many smaller
lakes. By locking the one outlet at the
Darling an enormous area of fertile
country would be given permanent water
supply. New settlers could grow all the
fruit, vegetables and fodder required in
Broken Hill and other north-western
centres, now brought from hundreds of
miles away.


An Ear to the
GROUND
WITH a chain of fully equipped offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Brisbane, Perth and Hobart and in the four main centres of New
Zealand, the firm of Mclnnes and Company, Limited, is in the enviable
position of having “an ear to the ground”—of being able to secure first-
hand information concerning any company or investment proposition. The
company also proposes to extend its activities in this direction and also
strengthen its position by establishing offices in London and elsewhere in
the British Empire.
The inestimable value of this knowledge is further enhanced by the fact
that a highly-trained staff of efficient officers is employed by the Company to
investigate thoroughly laws of supply and demand, cause and effect. Its
research department is constantly employed in analysing investments and
securities to see if they measure up to this institution’s rigid specifications for
safety of capital and assurance of income. As individual investment needs
differ, personal contact and interest are given to each client, new or old,
enabling this institution to give a personal service to each investor. Invest-
ments and securities are investigated with microscopical research to prove
whether the investments or securities should be held, sold or purchased. The
inquiries of those desirous of benefiting from the resources and united organi-
sation of Mclnnes and Company, Limited, and those seeking specialised
knowledge are therefore welcomed.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Northern Harbors
‘Lugger’s Mate”: With a consistent
programme of wharf improvements at tho
Townsville and Cairns harbors, pi ns the
beginning of a real harbor at Mackay, the
only main N.Q. centre without decent port
accommodation soon will be the Innisfail
district. The local people again are taking
up their fight for proper harbor facilities
at Mourilyan. The district is the largest
sugar area in Australia, and is backed
by a timber, maize and dairying hinter-
land second to none. The produce of
the sugarmills at Tully, SI Johnstone,
Cioondi and Mourilyan is railed or
Shipped in tiny lighters to Cairns, 71
miles to the north, or to Townsville, 139
ihiles to the south, before it is put aboard
the inter-State or overseas vessels, a pro-
cedure that costs the industry an unneces-
sary £70,000 per annum at least. Tully,
being on the main line, rails all its sugar
to Townsville, another puzzle, seeing that
Cairns is only half that distance. A 3ft.
6in. line from Mourilyan, nine miles to
Boogan on the main line (six miles south
of Innisfail) would obviate all the trouble.
A Royal Commission recommended it
ten years ago, and Theodore earmarked
£84,000 for its construction. There is a
2ft. tramway which brings down sugar
at a rate of 75 tons a train.. A lighter
holds 250 tons, and so has to hang about
the wharf between trains. At Mourilyan,
on deep, wide water, is 800 feet of
wharfage with sheds, etc., and provision
for a 3ft. 6in. line. The entrance bar,
which has been called a “difficulty” at the
port, is more than 18 feet under water
at low spring tides, and at high water
is 28ft. 6in. under. Vessels drawing 28ft.
have visited Mourilyan.
“Ela”: Papua’s Legislative Council has
been considering the tightening up of the
White Women’s Protection Ordinance.
The present maximum
penalty for entering a
white woman’s sleeping
room is a year ; if it is
proved that the intruder
touched the woman he is
liable to imprisonment for
life. An hon. member
reckoned the differentia-
tion was an injurious one.
The intent was after all
the essence of the crime
and should count even
where commission has not
been possible. The trouble
is that the hon. gent, is
asking the Law to pre-
sume intent. Under the common law
whereof the memory of man runneth
not to the contrary intent has to be
proved. Even the Papuan L.C. should
think twice before deciding to override
the practice of a thousand years and
more.

“N.Q.”: Cane-farmers and sugar-
workers around Ingham (N.Q.) have
lately been afflicted with a mysterious
disease which has caused seven deaths
out of 20 cases in a restricted area. For
a bit it was thought the trouble was in-
fectious jaundice, one of those obscure
diseases which occasionally take an un-
accountable gallop in tropical countries.
Dr. Cotter, of Canberra, has reported that
the cases seem due to cumulative poison.
He is not sure yet of the poison, but is
inclined to blame the phosphorus baits
used in canefields to kill rats.

“Wongie Wongie”: “Mudurup” (B.
11/7/’34) was wrong about John Forrest’s
trip along the coast of the Bight in 1870.
The second landing of stores took place
at “Twilight Cove,” about half-way be-
tween Eucla and Israelite Bay. The
remains of two small vessels which met
the party, the schooner Twilight and the
cutter Bumip, are still there. Both were
blown ashore, and became total wrecks.
When I was there 26 years later the
frames of both craft were in good order.
As they were of jarrah, this was no small
wonder. I started my sea training under
J. J. Sale, one of the men in command.
* * * *
“Nindherry”: The Duke of Gloucester
will think he is in Ceylon when he goes
to stay at Buderim Mountain, which rises
out of a flat sea plain in a tangle of
tropical foliage and then links itself up
with the Blackall Range, about 60 miles
from Brisbane. The soil is red and vol-
canic, and the views are wonderful.
Through a fringe of bananas and over
a no-man’s land of pineapples he will
see the 25 miles of beach which run from
Mooloolah to Noosa, two broad rivers
and the curious mountains of Coolum
and Nindherry. Twenty years ago I
spent a honeymoon at Maroochydore,
which nestles under the shoulder of
Buderim. Altogether the population
which shared the 28 inches of rain which
signalised my nuptials numbered four.
Now, there are two thriving townships,
motor roads, launches and an aerodrome
—all the appanages of a civilised seaside,
in fact, except sharks, which do not seem
to like the taste of the local human.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: New Guinea people are a
fairly healthy lot where mortal diseases
are concerned. Though one in every
four whites received medical treatment
last year, only five Europeans died. The
Asiatics, numbering 1300-odd, had only 81
of their citizens under the doctor, and
four died. Malaria, “septic conditions and
abscesses” and gastric complaints seem
to be the favorite diseases among whites,
though natives are most strongly affected
with the unpleasant frambcesia, of which
more than 3500 cases were treated, and
tropical ulcer (3600 cases). Venereal
disease is rare among the Kanakas.
* * * *
“F.Y.7”: Brisbane saw a notable stock
transfer when W. G. Anderson, of Tober-
mory, 90 miles across the N.T. border
from Urandangie, landed young bullocks
at Cannon Hill abattoirs after a 1600-mile
trek on the hoof and rail. For 12 years
the stock from this run have gone to
Adelaide. The cattle are a young, even
lot, compact, and conforming well to the
fashionable “baby-beef” requirements.
Many are polled, and most are short-
“Go and help, Jacky.”
“No fear! If that pfella’s grandfather not come here this pfella might he

horns or dehorned longhorns. To this
was due the remarkable absence of bruis-
ing, which surprised the Brisbane experts.
They were as quiet as a dairy herd in
the yards. There were 303 bullocks in
the mob which left Tobermory for
Dajarra, 200 miles away. One had to be
dropped for lameness, and another was
given for food to Dajarra residents. The
full number disembarked at Cannon Hill
was 301, none being lost on the 1400-
mile rail journey.

The central executive of the Labor
party has scotched a cool proposal that
the historic house of Newstead, some
time ago granted in trust as a public re-
serve to the city of Brisbane, should be
used as an official residence for the
Labor Lord Mayor. It would have
meant the loss of thousands of votes,
so Labor aldermen were overridden.
The house is at present used as a
historical museum. A fine type of
the old wide-verandahed colonial dwel-
ling, and beautifully situated on a
bend of the Brisbane River, it was built
in 1843 by Captain Wickham, then Gov-
ernment Resident of Queensland. For
many years later visitors were entertained
there by the Harris family.
* * * *
“Travel Stain”: The low-level bridges
that have held up mails and passengers
and campaigning politicians in N.Q. for
many years are to go. Those to receive
immediate attention are the ones over the
Herbert, Tully and Mulgrave rivers,
which are responsible for several weeks’
delay every year. The people north of
Capricorn have been calling for high-level
structures for years, but it has hitherto
been contended that high-level bridges
were too prone to be swept away by the
force of debris, which passes over the
lower bridges on the floodwaters.
* * * *
“Trapper”: In the Whitsunday group
only one island of the 70-odd has dingoes
on it—Whitsunday itself. They are there
in hundreds. They aren’t pure, and with
generations of inbreeding they are evolv-
ing a distinct type. How did they get
there? In the long ago Whitsunday was
the only island on which the aboriginals
made a permanent camp. They only
visited other islands. As usual, Binghi
had dogs in his camp. As always, some
of those dogs went wild. Apart from that,
the sawmills on Whitsunday once had a
lot of workers also with dogs. The dogs
have wiped out the wallabies. They have
pulled down and killed the last of hun-
dreds of wild goats, and they are now
learning to eat shellfish uncovered at low
tides, to live on scraps of flotsam, to
dig out soldier-crabs. But it is a losing
game. Soon it will be a case of dog
eat dog.
* * * t\i
“Papaki”: “Sailor” lays about him in
attacking my alleged statement (B.
25/7/’34) that “drugs” were responsible
for the sad case of Binghi, and very
justly remarks that the present high cost
of cocaine, heroin, etc., put those luxuries
far beyond Black Brother’s means. But J
wrote “opium,” and not “drugs.” “Sailor”
includes opium prices in his list, and
thus makes it evident that he is entirely
ignorant of the scourge which decimated
the Queensland abos. from the border
to the Cape for some 20 years from the
middle of the ’nineties. The opium these
poor wretches used was the charcoal
scraped from the inside of the pipe-bowl.
The seller was usually one of the
Chinese gardeners that most of the
western stations used to maintain, and
the price he got was a matter between
the parties. The charcoal was not
smoked, but dissolved in water and
drunk. The result was a devastating
poison far swifter in its effects than
smoking opium. The craze spread
rapidly in Queensland, and round the
N.Q. towns where the Chinese popula-
tion was large the effect was devastating.
The various Protectors of Aborigines
worked hard under the admirable
Queensland Acts to stay the plague. I
am told that they succeeded in time, but
not until a very heavy toll of Binghi
had been taken.
“Australia Jane’s” Budget
The fashion parade and entertainment held in
the City Hall in aid of the Metropolitan C.W.A.
and the Playground Association was a huge
success. Both the matinee and the evening
show were crowded. Harry Borrodale and
Frank Daly deserve bay leaves for their splendid
work as producer and stage manager, and Erich
John, the music director, also has a kind
word coming his way.
Of the amateur mannequins who paraded in
very glad rags, the palm goes to Peggy Men-
zies. She was charming, and, to an older
generation, very like her aunt, Lily Collins,
whom we oldsters well remember as the pretty
golden-haired girl who played the harp in the
days when such a thing as the war seemed
a ridiculous impossibility.
The fashion parade featured the frocks which
would be worn to a series of pre-wedding teas
—including a summer cruise—and so pave the
way for the bride and her 'maids and all the
pretty guests.
The Seamen’s Institute and the Creche and
Kindergarten Association benefited by the ball
held on the Naldera. His Ex. was piped aboard
by the serangs, was received by Jock Birchall,
and welcomed on deck by Commander R. C.
Dene and a reception committee headed by
Mrs. A. E. Moore. Masses of flowers were
everywhere, each reception-room having a
scheme of decorations all its own. Mrs. A. V.
Logan introduced the debs., among whom
was Nell Griffiths Oxley, daughter of the
E. G. Oxleys, and a great-granddaughter of
Brisbane’s, discoverer.
The powers have decided, tentatively, that
the Duke shall spend his second week-end in
Quensland at Buderim House, the home of
the J. J. Murphys on Buderim Heights. The
view would be hard to beat, for from the
wide verandahs one can see a turbulence of
tropic hill and river, beach and sea around
Maroochydore. The Murphys have two child-
ren, Margaret, aged 15, and Eileen, aged 7.
Margaret was born in S. Africa, where her
parents lived for some years before father —
an Australian —came home again, and took up
land on Buderim. His hobbies are golfins.
fishing and yachting, so the Duke should have
a ‘cheery few days up there, away from the
crowds which haunt all visiting royalties.
Nell Haymen has had a busy week, for not
only did she have to act as official hostess at
the Bankers’ Ball, but she also is president
of the Younger Set which took so big a part
in the fashion parade, and managed the sweets
and programme sales.
Our Sir Leslie had plenty to do on the even-
ing that he attended both the Masonic Ball
and the Bankers' Ball. There were good suo-
plies of debs, on hand at both shivoos, and the
big events of the evening were their presenta-
tion. A dreadful slump of debs, is predicted
for next year, so many of them having taken
time by the fetlock and made their dash into
society a full year before they had any right
to do so. All because the Duke is coming.
At the first Police Ball staged in Brisbane
there were five pretty debs.: Hazel Tuesley,
Hazel Debney, Beryl Cameron, Monica Perrin
and Marie Mclver. The big men one so seldom
sees out of blue looked handsome in their
party clothes at the City Hall.
During the 35th year of its existence, the
Charity Organisation Society helped about
1500 cases and £769 was spent in relief, in-
cluding about £390 from the Walter and Eliza
Hall Trust, which made 69 homes a good deal
happier than they otherwise would have been,
these facts were made known at the annual
meeting, when Rev. Norman Millar proposed,
and Rev. H. M. Wheller seconded, the adop-
tion of the report.
One of the latest engagements is that of
Clodagh McCord, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
E. K. McCord, of Coonambula, and a niece of
Mrs. H. G. Noble, of Brisbane. Clodagh quali-
fied as a masseuse at Sydney University, and
has been practising in Grafton. Her fiance is
A. J. Finlay, manager of the Union Bank in
that town.
Romeo Lahey—he really was christened that,
and, besides being a brother of artist Vida
Lahey, he is the man whom we have to thank
lor the preservation of Lamington National
Park—has just found several aboriginal burial
caves. The first discovery led to further search,
and with author Arthur Groom and other resi-
dents Mr. Lahey found three snow-white caves,
exquisitely beautiful, and one was large enough
to shelter about 1000 people. The caves are in
terraced formation in the cliffs that frown down
on the Cooma Gorge. Traces of aboriginal
cooking fires are to be seen in some of them,
together with the bones of native animals,
Fortunately, they are in a Government re-
serve, so they may remain unspoiled.
Over 300 guests rolled up for the annual at-
home arranged by the Engineering Under-
graduates’ Society of the Queensland Uni. The
Dean of the Faculty, Prof. R. W. H. Hawken,
and his lady (the latter swathed in oatmeal
crepe and lace) greeted the guests, and looked
after the official guests, who included most of
the staff and their wives.
Nancy Echlin that was, Mrs. Eric Feldt
now, arrived back from Madang by the Mac-
dhui, and was enthusiastically greeted by his
sisters of the Inky Way. Nancy is over on a
six-months’ holiday with her parents, Captain
and Mrs. Dick Echlin. Her husband will join
her in Brisbane about the end of October, and
will spend his leave here before they go back
to the wilds.
The R.vS.S.I.L. will hold its Federal Congress
in Brisbane this month. The C.T.A., Tati.’s
Club and the Irish Association all have made
the delegates honorary members for the duration
of their stay. Lunch with the State Govern-
ment, high tea with the Legacy Club, a day at
the seaside and a few other bright spots will
relieve the business side of the affair.
Thursday saw the first of the two vice-regal
garden-parties and also the Matrons’ Ball.
Most of the hostesses at the latter were guests
at Government House in the afternoon, and it
must have been a mad rush for rhany of them
to race home from Fernberg, change into full
evening kit, go on to a dinner or a cocktail-
party, and arrive on time to welcome the
guests. The country people are coming into
town much earlier this year, as the garden-
parties and the Matrons’ Ball are two of the
big social events. Amy Smith, Lady Wilson’s
niece, hostessed for Sir Leslie, and Miss Pat
Honnor and Capt. Pat Honnor helped to look
after the guests.
Mrs. J. S. Lipscombe—she was Marjorie
Byram—is down from Julia Creek for “the
doin’s.” She brought along her two small
daughters and baby son, and all of them
are staying with grandfather and grandmamma
H. W. Byram. Mrs. Reg Quilty, of Ner-
nianton, also is here. The dreadful climate
doesn’t seem to have done any harm to either
lady’s complexion.
The committee of the Bankers’ Ball did a
very decent thing when it decided to hai/
over the profits to the Legacy Club TLe
Legacy Club does a big work, and asn te-
cial help that comes its way is well deserved.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
No matter where you stood the Union
Jack and Australia’s flag fluttered above
you when the 2nd Division of the
A.M.F. held its ball at David Jones’s.
The tables wore autumn blooms and
satin ribbons in the colors of the various
units. Eyes were as sparkling as the
medals ajnd decorations that flashed on
the scarlet mess-jackets of the officers.
Major-General Rosenthal and his lady,
whose black laces had draped sleeves,
showed commendable impartiality in
greeting the guests; Acting-Governor
Street and his wife, who came in on a
fanfare of trumpets and a roll of drums,
had a special word and smile for the six
snow-white maidens who came fluttering
down the length of the room to make
their bow. The lady scattered large
black chenille flowers on her black nets.
Colonel Secombe was the A.D.C. in
attendance, and Mrs. Secombe’s sunset-
pink laces were worn with a black velvet
coat. The Lud Mayor brought his lady
in wine satins, and Town Clerk Roy
Hendy’s wife tied a rainbow around the
waist of her parchment tulles. Mrs. A.
S. Allen (whose Colonel was president of
the committee) added apricot satins to
the colors of the night, and sec. of the
dance Capt. N. N. Boyle’s sparkling-
eyed wife wore ruffles on the coat of her
lupin-blue georgettes. Lieut.-Col. Man-
chester, his wife in black velvet, and a
radiant daughter, Gwen, in a frock of
dusty-pink georgette threaded with silver,
dispensed spots.
Those summoned to the Law Society’s
ball, “holden” in the Blaxland Galleries,
attended in force. The L.S. president,
T R. Bavin, the Chief Justice Jordans,
the Attorney-General Mannings and the
Acting-Justice Maxwell couple were
piloted to the oasis of official carpet by
sec. O. L. Davis. Patricia Nall pinned
violets on the corsage of her mauve
crepes. Three red roses glowed on
Audrey Nicolson’s mist-grey chiffons.
Pat Wiesener’s rose-pink taffetas had
ruffled godets. Olive Vaughan’s green
crepes ran to silver at the neckline, Judy
Burleigh banded her white crepes with
sable and Evelyn Lee glimmered silverly
to her toes.
At the ball for the Freemasons’ Bene-
volent Institution Dr. F. A. Maguire
came in the full regalia of Grand Master.
Mrs. Maguire was with him, her cameo
pink satins sown with opalescent sequins.
There was a march of Master Masons
and Grand Lodge officers, and 73 debs,
walked a mile or two of red carpet under
an arch of steel and roses to make their
bow to Acting-Governor Street and his
wife, whose black fa<?onne velvets flashed
silver at the neckline. They stood at the
foot of the dais under the insignia of the
U.G.L., and set about their stance were
palms and high standards of golden
poppies. The Kelso King couple were
in this group, her vintage laces sweeping
into a train. Sydney’s Mayoral Lud
squired Mrs. Parker. Mrs. H. J. Wilkins
wore black velvet and brought daughter
Elza in dusty-pink laces. Mrs. D. S.
Murray, president of the F. 8.1. ladies’
committee, wore burgundy velvets.
Golden blooms flanked the bandstand ;
poppies and tender gfeen ferns brimmed
over baskets hung high from the ceil-
ing ; tall standards of foliage and pop-
pies made beautiful the pillars of the
Oak Room at Farmer’s. The fragrance
of stocks and sweet-peas surrounded the
tables. The men came in their best
manner; their best girls in their best
dresses. They all danced the barn dance.
There were a Frances Scully ballet, cigar-
ettes in the smoke-room, and all the
other trimmings that go with an expen-
sive supper. No one went home until
morning. The Sports Club of the stock-
brokers was having a night out. Among
the merrymakers were chairman of the
Sydney Stock Exchange O. D. Steel and
Mrs. Steel.
With the appearance of brown
boronia, wattle and daffodils, also blooms
the Royal Art Society’s Exhibition.
Crowds came to the pre-view, and these
crowds, plus a few more hundreds, found
their way to the Education Department’s
gallery on Saturday for the opening by
Acting-Governor Street. With him came
his lady, in black worn with ermine, and
Justice Street. On Friday Judge Rich’s
wife, the Williams lady, Mrs. Norman
Lowe and Joseph Wolinski were there.
Their talk ranged from the artists and
their canvases on the walls to a discussion
on the advantages London has to offer
over Sydney. The Rich lady's summing-up
in favor of Sydney was as logical as any
her distinguished husband could make on
a case before him. Mrs. Herrick Knowles,
looking much better, called in but didn’t
stay long. Molly Flaxman’s blue hat was
a vivid bit of color, and not to be over-
looked was the 6ft. 4in. of solicitor Percy
Higgins.
J. S. Watkins and Lister Lister were
there both days. Alfred Coffey talked of
hi s holiday in
Ce”ylon (many of
whose beauties he
has transferred to
canvas) and of
niece Olive Clif-
ford’s engagement
to Edgar Temple,
of the B.C.C. Mary
and Kathleen
O’Neill found
stimulation in the
pictures and in
greeting old
friends. The three
Souter girls piloted
father around the
walls, and after-
wards were seen
drinking tea in
Mrs. Norman Mc-
Leod’s party,
which included
Mrs. Florence
Taylor, in a black
velvet coat and
skirt. Howard
Hinton was there ;
so were George
J ohnston and
Thora Unger.
Charlie Bryant’s
sisters greeted
friends before his
canvases “St. Paul’s,
Lon d o n,” and
“Boat at Anchor,
St. Iv e s,” and
Mary Edwards
walked in grey and
a preoccupied air.
The James Jacksons were the centre of
congratulatory groups. His “Old Road,
South Coast,” will move to the National
Gallery when the Exhibition closes its
doors. To the same address will go
G. K. Townshend’s water-color “Coast
Line,” and another of George Johnston's
self-portraits (his pencil drawings have
been a feature of this page for some
weeks) is to be hung in the State’s
treasure house. The first was bought by
the Gallery in 1931.
Jerrold Nathan’s “Radiant Woman-
hood” and Joseph Wolinski’s “A Red
Cape” held every woman’s eye. Sheila
Lowe is the subject of the latter; the
red velvet cape she brought from China,
while the jade-green background is a
Siamese panung lent by Mrs. Norman
Lowe.
The bells of St. Mary’s tolled over the
city on July 31, and even as the last
note broke on the air “Requiem aeternam
dona eis, Domine!” breathed Monsignor
Hayden. The Requiem Mass for Dr. Doll-
fuss had commenced. To the Basilica
came Sydney in its hundreds to show
sympathy for Austria and pity for the
man whose life had been so tragically cut
off. All the Consuls were there. Captain
Stevens represented the G.G., and Cap-
tain Secombe Lieut.-Governor Street.
In the sanctuary the catafalque, covered
with the flag of Austria and surrounded
by candles, drew all eyes. At its head
was a laurel wreath from the Austrian
community in Sydney, tied with the red
and white of their country in ribbon and
in flower. The light from the candles
caught the amethystine robes of Monsig-
nor King (representing the Apostolic
Delegate, who is in Queensland) and of
Monsignor Monagh, who represented the
still sick Archbishop Kelly. Dr. Leonard,
from a pulpit hung with the Austrian
flag, spoke of the dead man, his faith and
his love of country. Dr. Hayden pro-
nounced the absolution. The candles
were blown out, and the sad rhythm of
Chopin’s “Funeral March” filled the
cathedral.
Here is Suzanne Stogdale, one of Syd-
ney’s lucky young things, who goes every-
where and is in everything. Squash and
tennis are her chief delights. She is the
elder daughter of the G. Stanley Stog-
dales, of Buckhurst Flats, Double Bay.
The C. D. Murrays, of Burwood.
scored the only really good night in the
week for daughter Margaret’s dance. This
was held at No. 11 Onslow-avenue. The
mantelpieces were smothered in camellias,
nasturtium and violets. Mrs. Murray
greeted the guests in black velvets and
black foxes. Margaret’s Lorelei-green
moires wriggled a fishtail train. Father
was voted a good host by the guests,
among whom were Betty and Molly
Wiesener, Margaret Merewether, Joan
White, of Muswellbrook, Barbara West-
garth, the medical Malcolm Frizells and
Keith Craigs, Bob Duval and John
Faviell.
The All-Blacks turned up in force to
the mid-week Rugby Union Ball at Hor-
dern Bros.’, and the gusto with which they
gave the haka showed that their spirits
were undaunted by the wind and the
rain. Mrs. R. A. Eakin, president of the
dance, was supported in receiving by
Mrs. V. Inglis. Came Sydney’s Mayoral
Parkers, she in burgundy laces, and
Town Clerk Roy Hendy and his wife,
who covered her tulle frock with a gold
lame coat. Cecily Wheelihan and Doris
Clarke, both in rose-pink crepes, and
Barbara Balls, in floral taffetas, were
three of the night’s pretty young things.
Furlough House benefits.
The students of Sancta Sophia staged
one of the jolliest of the Uni. dances this
season. Scarlet arum lilies, green leaves
and daffodils decorated the ballroom and
dining-hall, and reflected the red, green
and gold of the college colors. The
Sheldon lady, Miss K. Egan and senior
student Mary Arnott received the guests,
among whom were the Bavin and
McKelvey knights and their ladies, many
professors and their wives, the Marchese
and Marchesa Ferrante, and representa-
tives from the other colleges.
On a wet night of last week Jessie
Clark slipped quietly into the city Metho-
dist Church and emerged Mrs. Cyril
Ruwald. There was no bridesmaid to
follow the bride’s palely-gold chiffons or
to hold her sheaf of lily-of-the-valley,
but after the ceremony there was toast-
drinking by a small party of relatives and
intimate friends at the Australia. The
bride is the daughter of the J. Clarks,
of New Farm, Brisbane, and the ’groom
is an architect of the firm of Reg Pro-
vost. The newly-weds’ home is at Walla-
cia. It was designed by the bridegroom,
and is the sort of country house that
one dreams of. It has a swimming bath,
garages and stables and enough ground
to lay out a golf links if the owners are
so inclined.
Florence Austral and flautist John
Amadio arrive to-day by the Limited
Express, and not by car as at first in-
tended. The Country Women’s Asso-
ciation, the Musical Association and the
Lyceum Club are giving parties in their
honor—and John is going to talk on
flutes and the playing of them (which
dates from the days of the early Greeks)
to several of Sydney’s high schools.
From a Sydney writer in London:
At Ascot floppy hats and trailing dresses —
many of them organdie—were allowed to appear
on Gold Cup day, although it was cold and
soppy, so much so that there was no royal
procession. All the royal ladies were beauti-
fully dressed, and Queen Mary, in a gold
brocade coat topped off with sable, truly
looked her part. Her gloves toned exactly
with the color scheme of her ensemble. Colored
gloves were quite an epidemic, though the
organdie beruffled mesh ones were too opti-
mistic for the day on which the drought de-
cided to break. Ascot is a common, and
buses and motor-coaches go out and get. a
position along the outside barriers. After
that you buy tickets for the paddock, the
stand; everything’s an extra.
I called at “Punch” office, and they were
charming to me. They spoke beautifully of
The Bulletin. A. P. Herbert, looking tremen-
dously fit, gave me my introductions, and
then breezed off to Gravesend to see a barge
race!
Later on I was at Nellie Leech’s. She gave
the loveliest little lunch, and had Marjorie
Osborne and, later, Dorothy Gordon and Ant-
arctic knight Hubert Wilkins’s wife in to meet
me. Nellie is living in a neat little slice of
a house not far from Noel Coward’s. He has
turned two old cottages into one home by pour-
ing thousands into the transformation scheme.
The Wilkins lady is slim, young, of a cameo-like
pallor, and has auburn hair. She was all in
black, but had a gold neck-chain of old-
fashioned Florentine workmanship, Knight
Hubert is flying to Maoriland to proceed with
investigations about the South Pole. He
hasn't got his submarine to go under the ice
with him this trip, but his wife says he will
have it for the next expedition, and she will
be with him. I wonder! He is something of
a shy bird, and hears better on the right side
than on the left. When in London he and she
perch at the Mayfair, but they have a beauti-
fully tailored and manicured apartment in
New York.
Another Australian who flits between the
Statue of Liberty and the Trafalgar monu-
ment is Mrs. Alan McNab, who was Dorothy
Cumming. As lovely as ever, she is trying
her hand at play-writing. Her husband
is a noted etcher. Capt. Gilbert Nobbs, the
war-blinded managing director of Holbrooks,
has just left London, where he attended the
King’s levee and had a dinner given in his
honor in Parliament House.

Chatter
There was a bite in the air at Caul-
field for the first day of the Australian
Steeplechase meeting. The lawns round
about the tote have a threadbare look
from much trampling, and leave a mark
of damp mud up to waist of high heels.
Lady Huntingfield and Col. and Mrs.
Pott arrived before the first race in a
grass-green sedan; Mrs. R. G. Casey
was a visitor to the v.-r. box during the
afternoon. Probably the most comfort-
able people at the meeting were Mrs.
Massey Burnside and fair-haired Nancy
Greene, who brought a rug to the com-
mittee box and tucked it round them-
selves while watching each race. Mrs.
Noel Russell, of Baruna Plains, was
wrapped up in a sage-green coat, a cream
berette just visible over the top of her
high fur collar. Mary Baillieu’s rabbit-
weave tweed was of stormy-weather-blue
fluffed with white ; her little hat of the
same material had an upturned saucer
brim. A similar fabric in black with
a sprouting of white was used for Mrs.
James Barr’s suit and matching head-
piece. Pat Mills wore a burnt-orange
dress of the sporting button-up-to-the-
throat type under her flecked tweed coat.
Mrs. Harry Mcßoberts pinned a bunch
of gold pansies to the lapel of her beige
coat.
Mr. and Mrs. John Makower were given
a last farewell at the W. G. Mcßeaths'
cocktail drinking. The Makowers left
on Sunday for Sydney, where they
plan to spend a few weeks before pack-
ing up for the China, Japan and U.S.A.
route to England. For her party at
Forres Mrs. Mcßeath wore deep pansy-
blue lace woven in a diminutive floral
design and swirling gracefully into a
cape. The guest of honor, who received
orchids and lily-of-the-valley in the en-
trance hall, was in one of the new
season’s loosely-swinging coats of heavy-
weight black crepe de Chine over a pat-
terned dress topped with a small sheeny
straw hat. Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Hope,
Dr. and Mrs. John Shaw, the Lytton
Stephens couple, the Clive Steeles, Mr.
and Mrs. R. G. Menzies, the Marcus
Matins and the Hugh Pecks were a hand-
ful of the guests.
A band of very young things calling
themselves the Charity Chums manages
to pick up lots of fun along the wayside
of its money-raising efforts for good
causes. The Queen Vic. Hospital is first
favorite per medium of dances, tennis
and bridge parties and a physical culture
display planned for October. The drama-
tic club’s venture “From Nine till Six,”
with an all-girl and very young cast, filled
the Camberwell Town Hall on Saturday
night. On the stage Margaret Black’s
work was outstanding, and, off, Phyllis
Perry, in a scarlet cape over a white dress,
was a busy auxiliary president. Secre-
taries were Olive Sandell and Thelma
Jarrett; the former had duties both sides
of the footlights. Girl Guides lent a
hand with the selling of sweets and pro-
grammes.
The Malones of Melbourne reacted
in various ways to the party given them
by Polly Walker. Some were distinctly
nervous, and looked as if they’d have
turned tail at the top -of the stairs ; others
were frankly curious ; a few were stolid
and determined. Many brought children
of all ages, who wore their best-behavior
expressions and got a thrill out of being
photographed with the beautiful Polly
Walker (for she really is beautiful ; also
she’s charming to meet and has a sense
of humor). Polly wore black taffetas,
with narrow kiltings round the basque,
little “ears” standing up at the neck and
a nest of pleats in the skirt. Her hat was
anchored to a velvet ribbon round the
back of her head. Her mother was there
with daphne pinned to her fur coat. Cis
Roberts kept herself warm with leopard
spots. Shirley Dale’s black dress had a
slip-on yoke of silver lame, and her pan-
cake hat carried a silver bow under its
perilous brim. After members of the co.
had performed bits of comedy, tea was
served by usherettes in their dashing grey
uniforms. Much to his disgust, the
Siamese cat was left at home. He’s a
sociable cat, but won’t stand any non-
sense about having his tail pulled. He
likes going for walks, and is often seen
trotting down Collins-street on a leash
held by the beauteous Polly.
This Broothorn picture is of Belle
Faulks, a M.L. visitor to Melbourne.
She is the youngest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. John Faulks, from whose home-
stead at beautiful Lake Wanaka a com-
manding view of snow-clad mountain
peaks can be obtained all the year round.
Miss Faulks completed the Karitane
training course in Dunedin ; she does a
lot of riding and, in the summer, swim-
ming in the lake, which during the last
few years has become a popular tourist
resort. She is travelling with John Smith
and his daughter Daphne, who come
from Dunedin. The two girls have had
a gay holiday in Melbourne, and will
enjoy a final flutter in Sydney before
boarding the Wanganella.
The Austral Salon did its bit towards
the Pioneer Women’s Memorial with a
cafe chantant and bridge party. The
people who preferred music occupied the
main lounge, bridge players being out of
earshot in two secluded cardrooms. Hon.
secs. Miss E. Billinghurst and Alba
Zacutti hovered round the entrance, and
Mrs. Frank Beavis, in a white hat and
a camellia pinned to her black velvet
coat, made neat heaps of silver at the
treasurer’s table. Mrs. J. L. Stein, who
had had a busy morning arranging
flowers, wrapped herself in a fur-
trimmed coat over a dress with silver
motifs, and added an eye-veil as a finish-
ing touch to an infinitesimal hat. Among
those who listened to music were the
Macpherson Robertson lady, Mrs. F. J.
Freedman, in a brown hat and a brief
cape of dyed ermine ; Mrs. J. N. Mc-
Nicol, who sheltered under nectarine-
colored millinery ; Mrs. H. J. Robinson,
and Mrs. Watson Sowden. W. Dyring
was gallant at tea-time, and proved him-
self adept at balancing a tray loaded
with cups.
Every year as a memorial to T. S.
Hall the Science Club invites a leading
scientist to deliver a lecture in Mel-
bourne. This year the choice fell upon
Prof. Dakin, of Sydney, who brought
his wife over for the event. His lecture
on marine biology was not too technical
for a layman, and even the invitees whose
only claim to learning was of the re-
flected variety were interested. At the
conclusion of the meeting Prof, and Mrs.
Agar gathered up some 60 guests for
supper at their home. Mrs. Dakin wore
an oleander-pink capelet over her floral
dress, and Mrs. Agar’s all-black had
white reliefs under the lining of her
cloak. Among those who wandered
through the large rooms, filled with stocks
and jonquils, were the president of the
Science Club and Mrs. Bayliss, Prof, and
Mrs. Wood-Jones, Captain J. K. Davis,
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Rae and many mem-
bers of the Royal Society.
The Un-Named Players spent a senti-
mental evening under “The Red
Umbrella,” produced in aid of the Loreto
Free Kindergarten. It was a great night
for the 10 youngsters who brought their
“instruments” along to play in the per-
cussion band. They did their bit before
8 o’clock so that the sleepy ones could
be taken home early. Lorna Dawson
played the little oddity Whimsey Drew
in long, old-fashioned frocks and demure
flat-heeled slippers. It’s a play of simple
souls. Hal Percy, whose specialty is
murder stories over the radio, was the
village doctor, John Gillespie became an
apple-cheeked yokel, and Joan Illing-
worth, as the parson’s wife, wore an
amusing get-up—a coat and skirt which
fitted nowhere, a burglar hat over her
eyebrows and a piece of distempered fur
round her neck.
Mallee roots burned in the wide, open
fireplace and bowls of wattle and Iceland
poppies decorated the attractive drawing-
room at the Quamby Club for Mrs. Brian
Hooker’s bridge party. As a preliminary
to an adjournment for supper in the
dining-room Miss A. Snelson, one of the
guests, spoke upon the Blue Triangle
Movement, pushing home her point that
youth is more important than hospitals,
and that to serve youth one must aim
high. She’d like to see the swing-doors
of a young women’s hostel arising on the
most central site in Melbourne —Young’s
Corner. This last suggestion was received
with mixed feelings by the men listeners.
Mrs. Hooker’s sea-green dress slid into
a long and graceful train. On one bridge-
table she placed bridal posies and while
carnation buttonholes for her son and
daughter-in-law and another recently-
wedded couple, the John Wainwrights.
At other tables were noticed Staniforth
Ricketson and his tall wife, her black
satin gown showing a cape encircled with
fur, the David Grants and Nancy, Mrs.
Howard Clark, Mrs. Warren Clark, the
Percy Blackbourn couple, Phyllis Wain-
right (who had taken delivery of a smart
new coupe only that afternoon) and her
fiance, Dr. Turner.
Delysia is much sought after as a guest
for private parties. On one afternoon
she visited Caulfield Hospital, where the
patients were rather taken aback by her
make-up, but easily captivated when she
spoke to them. Afterwards she went to
tea with Mrs. Wallace Mitchell, proceed-
ing later to the Robert Knoxes’ cocktail
party, and after the show there was a
late supper-party. Delysia enjoys enter-
taining her guests a deux or in very small
batches. She’s an epicure, and had in-
tended to take a flat in Melbourne, but
weakened under the persuasive dishes
Menzies’ French chef sent up to her
suite. The management has now installed
an electric cooker in her sitting-room.
Here is Mrs. Noel Tinsley, who is to
be found this week at Kosciusko defend-
ing her title in the ski-ing championships.
As Kitty Moore, she competed in the
international races in Switzerland last
year, and has been for three years Aus-
tralian champion. Competitors must do
well in both divisions of this event, the
downhill race and the “slalom,” in which
the runners are timed individually be-
tween flags. Mrs. Tinsley keeps herself
fit with golf, tennis and riding. Broothorn
made the portrait.
The marriage of Deb Hackett and Mac
Knox will be a huge affair in Adelaide
early in September. This very young
couple want their flat all ready for occu-
pation at the end of their honeymoon,
so they leased it several weeks in advance,
and Deb and her mother are in Mel-
bourne on an orgy of furniture shopping.
Attractive Mollie Davern will hence-
forward pursue her journalistic career
with a wedding ring on her finger. Very
quietly on Saturday evening, with-
out bridesmaids, confetti or party, she
was married to Bernard Phelan. Mollie
is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Tom
Davern, of Hobart. Her mother came
across Bass Strait to help arrange the
bridal hat and a frock of dusty-pink
chiffon.
The engagement is announced of
Janice, twin daughter of the late Dr. S.
L. Angwin and Mrs. Angwin, of Arma-
dale, to Clifford Howard, eldest son of
the late H. H. Spowers and of Mrs.
Spowers, of Robin Hill, Berwick.
Edith Smart is managing yet another
exhibition. Until the end of this week
the Athenaeum will be occupied with the
Contemporary Art Group, consisting of
12 members and eight invitees. Seen on
the opening afternoon were Daryl Lind-
say—his horses are pastured upon one
wall; Mrs. Tweddle and tall daughter
Betty, whose portrait was one of her
mother’s exhibits ; Miss A. M. Plante ;
Mrs. Bernard Hall (her husband is
abroad on the trail of the Felton Bequest)
and daughter Alison ; Alan Henderson,
architect Bob Hamilton, Robert Croll, the
Felix Meyers, Arnold Shore and George
Bell.
Newly-created knight Robert Knox
was an early arrival at the Orama to meet
his wife and daughter Rosemary. The
warmth of his welcome to the travellers
after their five months’ holiday abroad
was expressed by an abnormally large
cocktail party at Menzies on the late
afternoon of the steamer’s berthing. For
this the. Knox lady was in a combination
of elegance and utility, her deep-pansy-
blue coat surmounting a crinkly silk dress
sprigged with a russet pattern, and her
wide-brimmed hat carrying green and
raisin-colored bands of ribbon. Rose-
mary’s coral-pink suit went with an
organdie blouse trimmed with one of the
new crisp poodle-dog bows.
“The Sacred Flame” has swallowed up
“Fresh Fields” at the Comedy. There’s
no scope in the Somerset Maugham
drama for very exciting clothes, Kathleen
Goodall’s “golden syrup” evening wrap
being the only garment which would
promote a prick of envy. Grace Lane is
and elderly in black or mouse-grey,
and Jane Wood comes out of her lan-
guishing neurotic “Fresh Fields” tea
gowns for a cedar-brown dinner dress,
a crisp nurse’s uniform and a navy-blue
tailored suit, worn with a spotty cravat.
The Rev. Dr. Law has written a bibli-
cal drama in blank verse, “Nebuchad-
nezzar,” introducing a touch of romance
to lighten the theme of faith triumphing
over false gods. Norman Wister pro-
duced the play for a four-night season
for charities at the Garrick. He played
the name-part and didn’t falter at having
to chew real grass in the mad scene.
Honors were shared with Alfred Bris-
towe as the comical chief steward. A
great deal of credit for the really mag-
nificent costumes goes to Mrs. Law. She
hunted the shops for materials, organ-
ised sewing-bees at the Toorak vicarage
and plied a needle with diligence. Young
things of Toorak did a splendid trade
every night with sweets and flowers.
Mrs. C. E. Blackett and elder daugh-
ter Alice haven’t seen much of the Per-
severance mine or Kalgoorlie for several
months. They went for a holiday to
M.L., then made a deviation to Queens-
land and are lingering in Melbourne for
another week before embarking on the
last lap of their homeward journey.
The spring dress shows are upon us.
On a luncheon of orange juice and a
wafer, the mannequins undulate along
a strip of carpet until they get backstage,
where they can drop their smiles, pick up
their draperies and scurry off to change
into something even more ravishing. A
few shows include an orchestra and a
bar.
It is only four months since 25 young
women gathered with a resolution to
collect money to establish adequate club-
rooms for the Blue Triangle movement
of the Y.W.C.A. Miss A. Snelson, who
is a wonder at raising money, arrived
from England filled with enthusiasm for
collecting the £20,000 necessary for a
really fine building. Her campaign is
thorough, for she has a method of reach-
ing women and girls in all walks of life.
The business girls are splendid. Some
earn only 15s. per week, but 2d. is put
away out of every pay envelope even if
it means walking instead of taking a
tram.

celebrity concert. A greedy house de-
manded from the great soprano more
than any vocalist should be asked to
deliver on a single night. She lifted the
orchestra with her through Isolde’s Nar-
ration (“Tristan and Isolde”) and some-
times left it behind in Elizabeth’s Greet-
ing (“Tannhauser”). In the Twilight of
the Gods (“Gotterdammerung”) the
singer and the accompanists were per-
fectly united in a musical conspiracy to
send their hearers home half-seas over
with emotional inebriety. Austral was
never in better voice or more inspired
dramatically. Her tones were as effort-
less when she was declaiming Brunn-
hilde’s ringing challenge to fate as she
leaps upon her horse and rides into the
flames as when Isolde is dreamily brood-
ing over her matrimonial entanglements.
By comparison with that debauch of
liquid sounds the first half of the pro-
gramme, which was given over to Cesar
Franck’s Symphony in D Minor, was
almost dry. The Franck symphony is a
scholarly work which only stirs the
pulses in the second movement, in which
the cor anglais gives out a melancholy
melody. Prof. Heinze’s crew managed
it very well.

In “The Plough and the Stars,” pre-
sented by the Independent Theatre at
Sydney Savoy, Sean O’Casey holds the
mirror up to life in the Dublin slums
during the 1916 Easter uprising. It is an
amazingly impartial document, and,
though not without faults, it remains
one of the most moving and vital
plays written in the last decade.
Doris Fitton’s players, as was almost
inevitable, had trouble with the Dublin
accent and were inclined to overplay the
comic bits, but they came out with colors
flying at the finish. Marie Rosenfeld was
the outstanding success as the distraught
Nora Clitheroe, whose husband is killed.
Husband was thoughtfully played by
William Gates. Mary Hosting, Arthur
S. Reardon, William Hume, Gertrude
Johns, John Alden, William Leahy,
Phyllis Chalumeau, Marguerite Cullen-
Ward, Alfred Race, Donald McNiven,
John Stacey and Harry Scott helped. The
group’s next production will be Clifford
Bax’s “A Rose Without a Thorn.”

It is time Sydney repertory societies
realised that their field is the straight-
forward plot* and full-bodied dialogue.
Jean-Jacques Bernard’s “Martine,” with
its difficult nuances of atmosphere and
its demand for superlative acting and
perfect technique, was unsuitable meat for
the Sydney Players’ Club, which produced
it last week. Jean Barlex and Laura West
did reasonably well as Martine and Jeanne,
and Arundel-Nott and John Copemann
strove valiantly. “Martine” was preceded
by Alfred Kreymbourg’s delightful little
“Manikin and Minikin.” Here the effec-
tive use of a giant pendulum swinging to
and fro behind the two china figures on
the mantelpiece was spoilt by the dia-
logue not being in the same tempo as the
swinging of the pendulum. Betty Mar-
shall and Gwen Geake were pretty as the
two figures. Arthur Dibley produced
“Martine,” and Alice Gould “Manikin
and Minikin.”
“Collits’ Inn” still revolves at the New
Tiv., Sydney, and “Gay Divorce” is in
its second week at the Royal. “The Wind
and the Rain” to-day cease to sweep the
boards at the Cri., giving place to Carter
the Great, who opens on Saturday.
Florence Austral and John Amadio give
the first of four concerts at the Town
Hall on Saturday.

Harry Thurston and his Vanities of
Variety are putting in a month or so at
Melb. King’s. It is unnecessary to go
into precise details concerning a show
which fades from the mind as the marks
of yesterday’s motor-wheels fade with the
frost from St. Kilda-road. The popular
entertainment of the moment is the off-
spring of a liaison between a camera and
a gramophone, and anything less mechani-
cal is unlikely to attract the fancy of
emergent youth. Therefore the Thurs-
ton enterprise is an improbable finisher
in the Excessive Prosperity Stakes. Never-
theless, it has its points, even if the
points are somewhat blunted by use and
tarnished by the rust of old age. “A
Devil on a Horse” shows the veteran en-
trepreneur at his vaudevillainous best,
and the gentle piffle of “June Roses” re-
veals him as a composer or decomposer
of sorts. Frank Melbourne, who is billed
as the city’s “favorite son,” is a dexterous
juggler, at any rate, and the Common-
weal Quintet are a well-trained five, with
voices not devoid of charm. Barbara
James is a Delysia two blocks removed
from the Spring-street original in place
and art. and Hal Percy and George
Moor; make Old Bill in Another ’Ole
worth an odd half-hour.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Our new Governor is not unlike his
predecessor. Lady Dugan is petite and
very charming.
The patriotic societies gave them a wel-
come in the Town Hall. The draping of
flags of all nations looked effective, and
the front of the stage was massed with
golden mimosa. The committee included
George McEwin (chairman), knight
Edward Lucas, Miss K. Kyftin Thomas
and Victor Ryan. Nine societies were
lepresented, and over 800 were present.
Dr. Ray Newling and Linda Wald sang,
and a pipers’ band and organ items were
in the programme.
The Prince Alfred Old Collegians’ week
of celebrations wound up with a dance
at the Palais Royal. Attorney-General
Jeffries received with J. F. Ward (head-

gowned in amethyst matelasse, worn with
a coat of silver lame. About 800 were
present. Decorations were in red and
white, the college colors.
A dance organised by Madame Kra-

Church at Glenelg and held in Glenelg
Town Hall proved a success. There was
bridge for non-dancers, and supper was
served at small tables, cabaret style.
The Con. students had their dance in
the Con. Common Room, with tables for
bridge in the southern hall, over which
Mrs. E. Savage presided. Large bowls
of scarlet peach-blossom decorated.
Director Davies and his wife received the
guests, Mrs. Davies in leaf-brown bro-
caded chiffon velvet.
The Convent of Mercy Old Scholars’
Association for its dance went to the
Apollo restaurant, where there were wide
window-boxes and tables arranged with
violet and mauve stock against a back-
ground of white broom and almond-
blossom. Dr. Eugene McLaughlin’s
pretty young wife wore iris-blue chiffon.
Dr. Alan Britten-Jones’s bride looked
charming in a diagonally-striped buff,
blue and red silk frock cut on slim lines.
Mrs. Ray Kenihan, wife of another
medico, chose a smart black toilette and
a scarlet floral halo. President of the
association Isabel White was gowned in
peacock-blue wind-swept chiffon velvet.
When the Free Kindergarten Union
started a Popular Child competition to
raise funds, it little guessed what a gigan-
tic affair it would develop into. Hun-
dreds of little ones were nominated, but
now the voting has narrowed down to 50
competitors. The youngster who comes
out on top will have something to live
up to.
• News comes of the marriage in Lon-
don of Lorna, eldest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. E. Langley, of St. Peters, to Dr.
Brian Maegraith, third son of Mr. and
Mrs. A. E. Maegraith, formerly of Adel-
aide. The bride, who was the guest of
Prof, and Mrs. Dreyer, was given away
by the Prof., and the reception afterwards
was held at their home.
WESTRALIA.
Three amateur events at the Hunt Club
races drew a large crowd to Belmont
Park in spite of howling winds and in-
cessant rain. Waterproofs and tweeds
dashed from shelter stands to tote, but
there was no lingering on the sodden
turf. President J. J. Poynton’s wife flung
a silver fox over black face cloth, and
niece Mable Teather muffled up in
Kaffir-brown velour. Jean Smith’s cheer-
ful Chinese-blue ran to a coat and man-
darin hat; Jo Temperley shielded tabac
brown with a scarlet brolly; Peggy
Watson-Williams clamped a brown beret
over gingernut cloth; Margot Law
perched a rakish sailor hat over warm
beige camel-hair; Mrs. Harry Vincent
punted in gay blue checks, and Hope
Robertson buckled a silver motif to her
roan halo.
The Swan Barracks quartered an army
of merrymakers at the Artillery Ball,
with streamers and balloons to match the
uniforms, and mounted guns to the
north, south, east and west of the ball-
room. Mrs. A. Watts’s flame satin
spurted beside her colonel to receive,
and joined the fire of the Hobbs lady’s
red-striped matelasse. The military Mar-
tyns, Wiecks, Bessel-Brownes and Mc-
Whaes were there, and the naval Grif-
fiths-Bowens. Marjorie Calthrop was at
home in slinky brown chiffons; Joyce
Burridge gyrated in lapis lazuli satins ;
Lorna Broom bloomed poinsettia crepes,
and Mrs. Oswald Battye had pastel
flowers strewn on Patou pink.
Misses Cummingworth and Seale, Bill
Darbyshire and Alex. Foster comprised
the small committee responsible for the
Gargoyle Social Club’s dance at the
Embassy. Bert and Alice and the Lash-
brooke Studio ballet were roundly ap-
plauded by Vacuum Oil’s manager
Murray and his black-lace-and-georgette-
clad better-half. Mrs. J. D. Rogers
slashed black chiffons with silver lame ;
Mrs. McLaren and Mrs. McLean stuck
to the sombre hue ; Mrs. Kim Kessell
flickered flame velvet, and Mrs. Felix
Levinson sprinkled delicate flowerlets on
ivory marocain.
Karrakatta Club members mixed tears
and cheers at their morning-tea to fare-
well past-president Mrs. S. J. Anderson,
who nestled presentation violets against;
dark tweeds touched with white. Mrs.
C. P. Smith’s befurred black velours pre-
sided over the gathering and distributed (
teacups ’twixt bowls of sweet-peas.
Nedlands Golf Club’s patron, Norbett,
Keenan, handed over trophies at the
club’s first annual ball. Mrs. Dudley’s
rose-pink laces occupied an official pew 1
in the lounge alongside Mrs. Dolan’s
Parisian black tulle flounces, and there
was dancing on the balcony, where fes-
toons of colored lights reflected their
rainbow tints on the swimming pool
below. Mrs. Colclough forked black
velvet with silver lightning ; Rua Christoe
drew a pink-satin Russian tunic over
black satin ; Vera Wain’s ice-blue lagoon
was shot with silver, and Marie Treen
billowed aquamarine taffetas.
Shekels rolled in for the hockey
players’ tour at the dance arranged by
the association in Claremont. Mrs.
Donald Tregonning, set about with blue
and silver, greeted the dancers. The John
Hargraves, Rex Norries and Charles
Cruickshanks came along, together with
Betty McCulloch (her organdies were
culled from a bank of primroses), Pat
Lang and Betty Merryweather, who
robbed the cornfields for her pique voile.
TASMANIA.
The Public Service Ball, in aid of the
8.D.D.1. queen can' /al, at the Con-
tinental, was attended by vice-royalty.
Lady Clark in mauve lace. Prof, and
Mrs. Morris Miller received the Governor
and his wife at the entrance.
The Governor and his wife were at the
City Hall for the Masonic Ball, Lady
Clark in blue lace and georgette. The
Lewis lady wore black with a short coat,
and the Mayoress sported black chiffon
velvet. Eight debs, were presented, all
in the regulation white, but with great
variety in the cut of their frocks. They
were Beryl Woodhouse, Molly Hall, Mary
Beck, Queenie Teague, Ida Wolf, Nancy
Lee, May Vicary and Marjorie Smith.
The show given at Hobart Town Hall
by junior members of the Repertory Soc.
drew a crowded house. Staging arrange-
ments were vastly improved. Plays
chosen were the one-acters “The Apricot
Tree,” “The Oak Settle,” “Distant Rela-
tions” and “Shivering Shocks.”
Sybil Lyons was guest of honor on her
birthday at a picture party, followed by
a dance at the Belfort Cabaret. Forty-
two guests sat down to supper at a T-
shaped table decorated with spring bulbs,
and danced afterwards till the small
hours.
Dr. Keith Armstrong, who has been in
Sydney for some years, came home to
say good-bye to his folk before starting
for London as medical officer on the
Port Alma. He will foregather with his
oculist brother, Dr. Hugh Armstrong, in
Bedford.
Cheers arose in the Speck’s Ski Club
over Ida McAulay’s success at Mt.
Kosciusko, where she carried off the
women’s championship.
Journalist Mollie Davern, of the Tas-
manian “Mail,” and later of Melbourne

BRIDGE
WITHOUT
SIGHS.
BY DR. H. L. TONKIN.
Two-bid or Not Two-bid.
Meet the forcing two-bid, which has
caused more dissension than all other
contract conventions lumped together.
There is disagreement, not only about its
requirements and responses, but whether
it should exist at all.
Casual perusal of literature shows that
there are at least four different two-bids
offered to the novice, each with its own
claim to perfection. Culbertson is
apologetic about his. He admits that
the two-bid is a more or less neces-
sary evil, because there must be some
provision for ensuring a continuance of
the bidding when one partner holds a
strong hand. Nearer the truth is the
appeal of a forcing bid to the imagina-
tion of most players. We like to be in
the position of dominance over our
partner. The official system, rather un-
justly fathered on Lenz, prescribes
a part-forcing two-bid on 31 to 4 honor
tricks with six to ten playing tricks. Part-
ner is not bound to keep on responding.
Similarly, the British two-bid, as defined
by Colonel Buller, is not absolutely forc-
ing. It is made on such an indefinite
holding as “a strong hand, which you
must let your partner know about.” If
partner has a poor opinion of your idea
of a strong hand, he shows it by passing
rapidly.
Both of these bids defeat their own
object by depriving a player of getting
a voluntary response from his partner.
Forced responses are of little value in
arriving at the correct contract. The
situations created by the casual British
bid are just as confusing as those
brought about by the American official
call.
A forcing bid should only be used to
ensure the continuance of the bidding,
and it should only be made with a hand
which can practically guarantee a game,
no matter how poor partner’s holding,
provided the best declaration is arrived
at. What is the sense of forcing your
partner to call on a possible blank if
you hold only about 3 V honor tricks and
six playing tricks? Your first considera-
tion on picking up a big hand and pre-
paring to make a force should be:
“What will I do if partner answers two
n.t.?” If your partner is forced to call
two n.t. you must be in a position to
rebid your first suit or name another one.
You must not plunge blindly into a
three no-trump contract.
The third type of forcing bid, that
defined by Hal Sims, is made on
holdings which he himself would de-
scribe as “power-houses.” A hand of
five or six honor tricks and ten playing
tricks is very uncommon, and it seems
to me foolish to place the requirements
for the bid so high that one will seldom
have the opportunity of using it. It
looks as if Sims errs on the side of
Caution in failing to force on deals which
require nothing more than a queen and
a jack opposite them to produce a game.
Up to date the happy medium seems
to have been struck by Culbertson, when
his bid is properly understood and intel-
ligently used. He does not prescribe an
exact honor-trick holding, but varies it
within reasonable limits according to the
possibilities of the hand in play. The
top cards may range from 4\ to six, and
on hands with six certain honor tricks one
is not recommended to force, as these re-
quire a voluntary bid opposite them to
'produce a game. On other holdings of
i ?{\
5| honor tricks you are warned against
forcing, as the playing tricks are not
there. Compelling partner to bid to
game in these circumstances is suicidal ;
unless he can make a voluntary response
the contract should stop at a part score.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
G.E.M. (Beecroft, N.S.W.).—The deal
you have sent is interesting, even though
the bidding is not according to the
canons: —
:
,
!
South opened with one n.t., West
passed, North said three spades, and
South’s four spades closed the bidding.
East-West contended that South might
have sought the possibility of a slam by
going to five spades instead of being con-
tent to call game.
Sims would pronounce South’s opening
n.t. an excellent bid. Culbertson’s fol-
lowers would prefer to open with one
diamond, especially as the hand con-
tains strength in both major suits. But,
with ejther system, North’s three spades
is a very dangerous call, because he can’t
guarantee to stop his partner at the game
bid. South is quite justified in placing
at least one of the red aces with North
and calling six spades. The best bid-
ding by North in answer to either one
diamond or one n.t. is four spades. With
an intelligent partner this will disclose a
hand with no strength outside the suit,
yet with every possibility of game.
L.E.P. (Carlton, Vic.).—Obliged for
your account of the exciting final deal in
the Joske-Seargent match. I consider
Joske’s bid of four spades one of his
best, and deserving of a much better
result.
A. (Hillston, N.S.W.).—You have
the idea of running a most enjoy-
able and instructive match, but I am
afraid that it is not possible without
the use of duplicate boards. Form your
club and affiliate with the N.S.W. Bridge
Association. Sydney Bridge Club then
can assist you with instructions as to
how a duplicate tournament is run, and
how to procure the boards.
B. (Marrickville, N.S.W.).—Whether
you learn better from a book or a teacher
depends on your mental make-up. Some
people have become good players
by reading Culbertson or Sims and prac-
tising ; others find that they cannot grasp
the principles without the help of a
teacher. Sydney Bridge Club could re-
commend one.


THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND
Impermanent and Unreproductive
At Mildura recently I saw unsightly
and insanitary rubbish dumps on both
Vic. and N.S.W. banks of the Murray.
What an opportunity to employ susten-
“Listen, you mug—this is the last time you’ll ever drive me anywhere!’’
ance workers in making a great boulevard
along the banks, protecting and en-
couraging the native flora! Instead, they
have been making a road near Red Cliffs
leading to nowhere in particular. In the
process they destroyed a great deal of
natural beauty, and by their ruthless
slashing have converted the area into a
huge, barren pancake.— Parcae (Vic.).
Why Are Young Men Unemployed?
Because young women have stolen
their jobs. You find girls employed as
lift-drivers, packers and accountants, not
because they are more efficient than men.
but because they take smaller pay.
From the “Positions Vacant” column
of my Sydney morning, paper:
Girls, 16, label cellophane grocery lines.
Girls, with knowledge of grocery prices,
smart at figures, used to office work.
Lady manageress, to take charge of
packing staff for well-known pharmaceutical
lines.
All men’s jobs. For men there are
vacancies like these:
Man with car, sell cheap kites. Com-
mission.
Young man with motor-cycle, delivery,
city and suburbs.
What opportunities for a youth who
has just been persuaded by Government
teachers to complete five years at a
secondary school! He will, lam sure,
make great use of his Latin and Greek
selling “cheap kites” or delivering mes-
sages. Turn to the “Positions Wanted”:
Youth with L.C. wants position in office,
factory or shop.
Young man, 2 years’ exp! > grocery and
provisions, like position town or country.
Highest references, educated and capable.
There is work for the youth of Aus-
tralia, but the employers (chain stores
especially) prefer to hire girls.—Unem-
ployed Youth (N.S.W.).
The R.A.N. College
I learn from an obviously inspired
communication that “the Defence De-
partment has received evidence that the
Navy as a career has attractions for Aus-
tralian boys.” The “evidence” is that there
were 265 applications for 12 cadetships.
In the 1919 “Report of the R.A.N.
College,” Acting-Captain Walters wrote:
The small number of applicants is re-
grettable. It appears to me that more
applications might be received if the college
were more advertised.
In that year the number of N. S. Wales
applicants was 87 ; this year it is 63. The
year before the N. S. Wales quota was
127, and in every other year it has been
in the neighborhood of a hundred or
over —and usually very much over.
For obvious reasons, an unprecedented
number of lads should have offered this
year. Every avenue of employment is
overcrowded, arid the professions are in
the worst way of all. The job-famine is
reflected in the position of the R.A.N.
lower deck, which is overwhelmed with
applicants, many of whom, besides being
excellent physical and moral specimens,
have matriculated from public schools.
There is no surplus lieut.-commander
problem on the lower deck.
Perhaps the secret of the decline in
applications for naval cadetships is to be
found in what Rear-Admiral Feakes —
himself a former Naval Board member
—wrote recently: “The naval side of
the Australian Defence Department
does not follow Admiralty practice.”
More youngsters will want to become
R.A.N. officers when Admiralty prac-
tice is substituted for War Precautions
Act practice.— Barbette (N.S.W.).
Not a Capital Levy
Many thanks for your review of my
book “What Is National Credit?” (B.
11/7/’34). 1 would point out, however,
that although I refer to the annual
license on wealth as a capital tax, be-
cause it would tend to reduce the capi-
tal value unless interest fell pari passu, it
is certainly not a capital levy. The
license of 2{ p.c. p.a. is less than the
annual yield, consequently it may be
likened to the appropriation of a por-
tion of the fruit of a tree, whereas a capi-
tal levy may be likened to the appro-
priation of the tree itself.
I think I have read the most important
books advocating a capital levy, and in
every instance the suggestion entails a
cash payment over a period, graduated
in some form, but consisting of an
annual payment considerably more than
the income yield. Therefore, in my
opinion, such a procedure is in every
way harmful, as pointed out by the
MacMillan committee.
1 defy any employer whose equity
does not exceed £20,000 to prove that
he would not be benefited by the aboli-
tion of all taxation save 2\ p.c. p.a. on his
equity, taking into consideration the in-
crease in earned profits due to the in-
creased turnover that would result from
such an alteration in the method of rais-
ing the revenue. Moreover, it would
abolish unemployment, and with it all
opposition of a communistic nature
against the continuation and expansion
of private enterprise.— Vincent Pantin
(N.S.W.).
Explorations in Scotland
Let me introduce you to an ordinary
Australian wandering around Scotland
getting some engineering experience and
suffering from the rate of exchange.
In a big grocery store in Queensferry-
street, Edinburgh, a few doors off Prin-
cess-street, I said “Give me a pound of
sultanas, please.” The assistant’s face
assumed that funny puzzled Scotch look
that I’ve got to know these last few
weeks, and I repeated the order very
slowly. He began to dig in a box of
very blond raisins. “What kind of sul-
tanas are they ?” I asked. “The best,
sir! The best,” he said. “Frae Turkey.”
I remembered being in a spot of trouble
with Turkey on Gallip. “Ever have any
Australian dried fruits for sale?” I asked.
“No, sir,” was the reply ; “people won’t
buy them! Can’t get the color. Too
dark. We had some once, but we had
to sell them to the bakers. One shilling,
please.”
A card in a window in Nicholas-street
said “Australian sultanas, sixpence a
pound.” They were just the kind we
get in Aussie for 9d. or lOd. a pound at
good grocers! They tasted a heap better
than Jacko’s, and I am getting another
pound to soak in peroxide or something
to get that platinum-blond effect. Looks
like profit to me if I can pull it off.
Are you still interested? Well, I didn't
like paying away 12s. 6d. of my con-
verted money for a bottle of Scotch, or
6d. a pint for “light” beer, or Is. for
“dark” beer out of the pump ; seemed
like a flag day for the waterworks. So
my mind turned to Australian wines. It
turned into a campaign.
Every grocer’s shop and
hotel have bottles with
swanky labels and
printed seals, but they
all say “Rich Austra-
lian Port” or “Aus-
Iralian Wines, Full
Strength.” Never a
name! M a c-S u n-
downlr (Edinburgh).
Opticians and Oculists
Correspondents on the subject of
optometrists have, I think, missed the real
point at issue. The sight-testing optician
is the equivalent, not of the dentist in re-
lation to the medical man, but of the
dental mechanic in relation to the den-
tist. He is primarily out to sell spec-
tacles, and the sight-testing part of his
business is ancillary to this.
About six years ago, following a com-
mission of inquiry, England refused State
registration of opticians (whose qualifi-
cations are the same more or less
throughout the Empire) on the ground
that it would not be in the public in-
terest.
The “refraction” hospitals referred to
(B. 18/7/’34) are not hospitals at all.
The word “hospital” implies beds, treat-
ment of patients and a recognised medi-
cal staff. “Refraction” hospitals have
none of these: they are merely places
where people who complain of their
sight are brought together by opticians
to be tested for glasses by their appren-
tices. For such people to say afterwards
that they have had “hospital” experience
would be misleading. And the fact that
the university in Adelaide has a course
in optometry does not necessarily mean
that the subject is one of university
status or professional standing.
Detection of disease, particularly in-
cipient disease in the eye, is by no means
“ What are you going to do with him, m’son?”
“Race ’im, Cap’n.”
“You’ll dam’ near beat him, too.”
easy, even to a person with prolonged
medical training, both general and
special. It is certainly not a matter to
be entrusted to anyone with only a smat-
tering of medicine. As in the case quoted,
even gross and easily detected conditions
such as conical cornea can be beyond the
capacity of the average optician. It is
quite wrong, therefore, for the layman
to think that if there is anything in the
nature of disease in his eyes the examin-
ing optician will be sure to notice it.—
Another M.B. (Maoriland).
“Under Government Supervision”
I introduced an overseas importer, here
on a visit and anxious to deal in Aus-
tralian produce on a “cash against docu-
ments” basis, to concerns supplying
the lines he desired. Contrary to the
usual nonsense we get from limelight-
seeking travellers, he considered the
packing, labelling and quality of the
articles shown to be at least equal, in
some cases superior, to lines on the
market in which he dealt. And prices
were satisfactory. He pointed to huge
stacks of tinned fruits.
“May 1 have samples of these?”
“Oh, yes!”
“And you can supply any orders that
I may cable?”
"Not until next canning season. You
see, we must can for export under
Government supervision.”
My friend regretted the delay, but sug-
gested that they arrange “supervision”
for the ensuing season. But here came
a deadlock —clients would certainly not
buy six or nine months ahead when
other supplies were immediately avail-
able. My friend agreed to take
samples on the off-chance. But they had
not been packed under “supervision”;
therefore the Department of Trade and
Commerce could not permit them to be
shipped.
An obliging civil servant suggested
that, as he personally knew the fruit was
equal to anything exported, a few tins
lying in the office could be used as
samples, and the lines referred to as
“equal to these.”
We tried a firm of jam-makers. It
had done a little exporting, and was pre-
pared to quote and furnish samples; but
the department was considering the
“supervision” of this manufacture to
ascertain actual amount of sugar used.
So this firm withdrew.
A Government-owned concern did not
think export of its canned meats worth
while ; it could not compete with the
produce of other States (although the
other States were not exporting to this
particular market). Dried-fruits ex-
porters could give no guarantee that
stocks would be available. On receipt of
a cabled order, provided they had a sur-
plus at the time, they would supply.
I gave it up for the time ; but a further
letter from another overseas merchant,
offering to establish letters of credit in
Australia and furnishing bank refer-
ences, lured me once more into negotia-
tions. I offered to pay freight on samples
forwarded. Two firms agreed to supply
a very small assortment; but they didn’t.
I called again ; wrote again and again '
their promise still remains unfulfilled.
I have purposely refrained from men-
tioning the particular State I am refer-
ring to, but anyone may have the details
by paying for my time and trouble; I
have spent enough.—J. A. E.

Getting' Hannigan’s Goat.
BY LANCE GAY.
lis a grievous thing to have to accuse
and arrest a boon companion, especi-
ally where companions of any sort are
as rare as they are at Iron Ridge ; but
Constable O’Leary did it.
If O Leary had been satisfied with
his wages all would have been well. But
being an acquisitive man whose self-
styled acuteness had caused him to for-
sake the company of his city super-
intendent (at the superintendent’s re-
quest) he was constrained to seek other
means of enrichment. These he found
in livestock dealing; and, being still a
policeman, though a disrated one, he was
in a position to receive those titbits of
information so dear to the dealer’s heart.
Occasionally, however, his information
was misleading: hence the trouble about
Hannigan’s goat.
Everyone who has travelled that curse-
paved, scrub-lined track from Tipanolher
to the Queensland border knows Han-
nigan, of the Iron Ridge Hotel. You
call in there with the dust of thirty miles
as thick upon your whistle as it is upon
your coat; and very soon Hannigan has
brushed your coat, lightened your pocket
and sweetened the very dust you swallow
with your beer. How does he do it?
I don’t know. I suppose it is the good
nature beaming through his grin that
revives the spirits and lends new zest to
even the flattest of his wares.
Anyway, if you are ever up that way,
keep an eye open when you are about
thirty miles north of Tipanother. You
will see a big, white roof set in a cluster
of trees, with a range of high hills in
the western background. That will be
Hannigan’s.
Hannigan’s possessions were not limited
to the liquid joys that bejewelled his
bar-room shelves. He had land: miles
and miles of it, stretching back into the
heart of that rocky, scrub-clad range in
the west. And it was there he kept his
sheep; and, though O’Leary did not
know it, his goats.
Hannigan’s goats were prolific, and
their numbers had to be periodically re-
duced. By devious means Hannigan
found out the price O’Leary was pre-
pared to pay for a small flock, and, by
using his friend Thompson as a kind of
dummy owner, he concluded the deal.
Hannigan had different earmarks for
his sheep and his goats. He had a rea-
son. Never did his goats appear as
assets or otherwise in the livestock statis-
tics he supplied to O’Leary, nor did they
figure on his income-tax returns. When-
ever necessary, Thompson handled the
goats and took the money, thus keeping
the dark secret of Hannigan’s goats from
the (not so) dreaded representative of the
Law.
Liking an occasional change from
mutton, Hannigan would drive out to
the hills, capture a goat, and, after dress-
ing it in his own slaughterhouse, deliver
it to his only assistant, the Chinese cook.
That artist would dish it up for the de-
lectation of Hannigan and his rare cus-
tomers. But not O’Leary. O’Leary,
though a regular patron of the bar had
never yet sat at meat with Hannigan.
Constable O’Leary was a bachelor and
a poor cook. He boarded with a widow
who was now and then called away to
some far-off wedding or some other
form of trouble. On such occasions,
O’Leary usually ate his meals at an ad-
jacent humpy. There came a fateful
day when he was moved to seek better
fare at Hannigan’s.
When O’Leary walked in to take his
midday meal the menu card, if Hanni-
gan had used one, would have read
something like this: “Goat—in any way
-you like it.” O’Leary was no connois-
seur of meats. He swallowed his first
mouthful without suspicion. He mouthed
the next. He was undecided ; then
sure . . . Goat! . . . And Hannigan kept
only sheep!
He began to wonder where Hannigan’s
“venison” came from. He put his mind
in reverse, and scanned again those statis-
tical forms Hannigan had returned to
him. No mention of goats met his quest-
ing backward glance. He began to put
two and two together, and, unfortunately,
made it five.
Hannigan had no goats: O’Leary had
lost some goats; therefore it must be
portion of an O’Leary goat he was eating.
With suspicion seething in his mind
he strolled round to the slaughterhouse
at the rear of the hotel.
Ah, a clue! A goat’s head tossed
carelessly aside. As Sherlock O’Leary
picked it up his jaws came together with
a grim click.
“The dam' thief!” he gritted. “So the
old scoundrel has been living on my
goats, has he? By this earmark, it’s one
of the goats I bought from Thompson.”
O’Leary went home, looked at some
papers and returned, to find Hannigan
dozing peacefully behind the bar.
“Listen to me,” the constable began in
the tone he used for quietening drunks ;
“I have a serious matter to discuss with
you.”
“Yes, yes,” grunted Hannigan, his
drowsy mind still wrestling with the
effects of his meal. “Yes ; as you say,
it is good to have a change from mutton
now and then.”
“Especially when the change is stolen,”
growled O’Leary.
Now, Hannigan had a system all his
own for showing O’Leary the present
state of his regard for that officer. “Sarr-
jint” or “Larry” marked the summit of
grateful friendship; “Constable” or
“O’Leary” was half-way up or down the
slippery slope their tempers braved to-
gether. But never before had O’Leary
heard the tight-reined hostility that
marked the mode of address Hannigan
now hurled at him.
“ Misther O’Leary,” Hannigan began —
“Misther O’Leary; let me tell you this:
there’ll be more O’s flyin’ than the one
at the front end of your name if it’s
accusin’ me of sheep-steal in’ ye are.”
“Goats,” corrected O’Leary.
“Goats be it, then. And if it’s accusin'
me of stealin’ goats ye are —well, maybe
I’ll sthrip the limbs from you, and feed
you to my pigs, policeman or no police-
man . . . However, you bein’ the Law as
far as this town goes, I’ll give ye a
chance to explain first. And be that same
token you can see how wake the stringth
of me Irish blood has grown in this dam’
climate. Time was whin I’d have the
joy of the fight first, and the sorry of
the explanation aftherwards.
“Now, Misther O’Leary, while I’m
calm and collicted, and before me blood
biles, will you be good enough to tell me
why you think I—er—absthracted a
goat? I’d say stole, but there’s some
words that bring the blood to me head,
and —yes, bedad! —to the nose of some
other body, maybe. Now,'tell me, why
do you think I —er —absthracted a goat?”
“First, because I ate some of it,” began
O’Leary. Then he went on in a voice
chilled to precise formality: “To con-
firm the suspicion aroused by the goat-
flesh on your table, I searched your back-
yard, and there I found the head of a
not-long-slaughtered goat. On this head !
were ears bearing earmarks identical
with those on my goats. It was one of
my goats you stole, Hannigan.”
“And now I’ll have the other one! ”
said Hannigan, vaulting over the bar
counter and landing within two feet of
the startled policeman.
Hannigan was a powerful man. His
pumpkin-like fist smashed into O’Leary’s
face before the Law could move ; and
that for the time was the end of O’Leary.
He lay quite still, as limp as the tongue
of a dog and as flat as Hannigan’s oldest
beer.
When Hannigan saw what he had done
to the Law his very soul shrank with
fright. “Now I’ll be arrested and charged
wid murder, if not worse,” he groaned.
Then, staring at his closed fist, he turned
it this way and that, addressing it as
though he were Hamlet with Yorick’s
skull. .
“You big, hairy murtherin’ melon!”
he growled. “ ’Tis no fit weapon for a
man to carry you are at all. You’ll be
hurtin’ somebody yet if I push ye real
hard. ’Twas but a tap, and jist look at
him! I suppose, be now, he’ll be flyin’
wid the blessed angels . . . No! . . . Be-
gob, he’s alive! . . . Larry, boy—can I
help you at all —in any way?”
O’Leary sat up and rubbed his cheek.
His half-glazed eyes roamed slowly
round the room until they came to rest
on Hannigan’s troubled face. He rose
slowly to his feet, and put his hand on
Hannigan’s arm.
“I’m going to arrest you, Hannigan,”
he said solemnly.
“Not for a little tap like that, surely,
Sarrjint,” said Hannigan wheedlingly.
“No, Hannigan—for stealing one of
my goats and misusing it with a butcher’s
knife. Lock up, and come with me.”
Hannigan’s fright faded into oblivion
at this reiteration of the insult to one
of his most cherished principles. “No
man will arrest me for phwhat I never
did,” he said truculently. “If it was for
attimpted murder, or even for assault,
now—but for stealin’? Niver, O’Leary ;
niver! ... I told you about that word,
(i Continued on next page.)


Misther O’Leary . . . The blood is in me
head fit to lift me scalp. Go way, man,
before it works me!”
O’Leary saw that he could not possibly
arrest Hannigan single-handed. "Very
well, I’ll make a disgrace of you, Hanni-
gan,” he said grimly. “I’ll call on your
own customers to arrest you. Do you
think they will ever patronise you again,
after that? Lock up your place while
l go and get them. They can’t refuse.
It is the Law!"
How that phrase terrified poor Hanni-
gan! O’Leary had not taken fifty paces
when he was brought to a standstill,
listening.
“Hi! there, O’Leary; have a heart!
yelled Hannigan. “Put me to no dis-
grace, constable, and I’ll surrinder. But
have a heart, man! Make the charge
assault or attimpted murder if you will ;
but niver say stealin’ to a Hannigan if
you value the King’s peace. ’Tis no
disgrace to assault the sayducer of a
man’s good name ; so don’t disgrace me,
O’Leary, and I’ll lock up and come wid
ye as quiet as any sleepin’ babe. ’
O’Leary, now in some doubt about the
correctness of his deductions, decided to
temporise. “Right; assault it is, then,
he said gruffly. “And carry some food
and beer up to the log with you. I don’t
know how long it will take me to find
Norris, the J.P. Most likely he’s out with
his traps.”
You will notice that O’Leary said
“log,” not “gaol.” There was no gaol
within a hundred miles of Iron Ridge ;
but on the hillside overlooking the hotel
there was a huge log to which chains
attached to legirons were affixed. Many
slowly-sobering men had sat on that log
and gazed wistfully at the white walls
of the hotel.
Hannigan filled a handbag with beer
and biscuits. After carefully lock-
ing every door and window of the bar-
room, he walked with O’Leary to the log.
Legirons were fastened to his ankles:
then O’Leary stepped back and stood
waiting expectantly.
Hannigan knocked the top off a beer-
bottle. “Here, constable,” he said, “have
one on the house. ’Tis not the first, and
1 hope ’twill not be the last. I’ll save you
trouble with your assault charge by
pleadin’ guilty—un’er such provocation
as no man of me blood could stand.
Find Mr. Norris, J.P., dog-trapper, et
citera, et citera, and get it over as soon as
you can. Someone may be wantin’ a
drink or a feed ; and wid the hotel locked
inside and out, except the kitchen, why,
man! he might starve to death of
thirst. . . And who’d be responsible? .. .
Why, the man who foorcecl the pro-
prietor to close up, av course! . . . The
same to you, O’Leary.”
Hannigan watched the constable swing-
ing down the hillside, and then stretched
himself out beside the log to console his
mind with the smoke of his pipe and the
meditations of a worthy man.
The afternoon passed drowsily away.
Evidently Norris, J.P., was not easily
found. When darkness came Hannigan
curled himself up in his rug, and, quite
contentedly, went to sleep.
He was awakened by a loud hulla-
baloo, and sat up rubbing his eyes
briskly. In front of his hotel he could
see, in dim outlines, two motor-lorries
whose headlights played upon a group
of noisy men. Through the clear night
air their words came to his ears like the
chatter of settling cockatoos. One in-
sistent voice, more strident than the
others, seemed to be advising someone
to “break in the door and wake the
old cow up.”
Hannigan thought sadly of all that beer
on tap with no one to draw it, and of
all that money down there, just aching
to be spent! That they were shearers
he knew ; and he knew also that, at this
time of the year, they had money to
burn. A mood almost of mourning
settled on his soul.
The tumult was stilled as O'Leary
came into the light with Norris, J.P., at
his side. There was a short parley, and
a hat was passed round. Something was
taken from the hat and handed to Norris.
O’Leary left the group, and came briskly
up the hillside.
“The boys have bailed you out, Hanni-
gan!” he said as he unlocked the leg-
irons, “and they want your attention to
their orders as soon as convenient.”
Hannigan grunted. “If you mane I’m
to serve them wid drink they will be
sorely disapp’inted, Constable O’Leary.
I wouldn’t do no after-hour tradin’ wid
you about, ’specially while you’re in your
present temper. That eye o’ yours is like
a slab of badly-smoked bacon.”
"Never mind me eye nor me temper,”
said O’Leary with a note of conciliation.
“Go down and serve those lads. They’ve
come a long way, and their tongues arc
hanging out with expectation and
drought. Norris tells me you will be
fined a fiver for assault to-morrow. Get
it and as much more as you like from
those shearers. The collection they took
up to bail you out was a bit more than
was necessary ; but never mind that.”
O’Leary’s hand went with the old-time
affection to Hannigan’s arm as he went
on meaningly: “I’m going home now,
lad. I’ll see you in your dining-room,
where the Court will sit, to-morrow.
Good-night.”
“There’s two bottles of the best in the
shade of the log, Const—Sarrjint,” said
Hannigan. “And may your shadder
never grow less, as they say in England.
And remember, Sarrjint, you didn’t buy
all me goats ; an’, if Thompson says you
did. you know as well as I do that all
the Thompsons are the sons or fathers of
liars, if not both ...
“Good-night, Sarrjint; good-night!”

What, again, O grizzled warrior?
1 thought you knew too well the battlefield?
That there were dents enough upon your shield?
1 thought you had laid down your lance, your
armor?
1 thought you said that all romance was over?
That you had farewelled Love with the last
lover?
But this will be the same! The poignant
stirring,
The waiting and the siege, the charge, the
sally !
And then the trump that bids the squadron
rally!
Come while escape is easy ! Do not dally !
Love is a cruel god, and keeps no tally!

Trade Winds.
The Trades are always loyal,
The Trades are always true,
Be ours the shaking royal
Or thrusting crank and screw.
To hear their voices singing
Across the white-capped sea
Is like a love-kiss bringing
Content to you and me.
In palms at lovely Santa,
North of the Hebrides,
Off lonely Palaranta
Thev’re singing words like these,
“On! " On! Be swift, be ready! ”
Yet, when the night has come,
The Trades, so true and steady,
Will bring the tired ships home.
The stiff-bowed steamers meet them
With white spray flung afar;
The island schooners greet them,
Such lovers as they are,
So hot in heedless onset,
So gentle as they blow
Into the red-rayed sunset
To fan its dying glow.
Their power is ever splendid,
As though they understand.
From haunts by sun befriended
They come, hand-over-hand,
To cool the gasping oilers,
Beneath the hot decks bound,
To roar beneath the boilers
And blow the turbines round.
The lovers by the wireless,
The seamen in the waist,
Know naught so true and tireless,
So linked with little haste.
By grim Cape Grafton turning,
They’ll rest in Mission Bay;
Where Venus’ light is burning,
At dawn they’ll be away.
They bid the white days waken
Ere dawn has shyly stirred;
In jib and tops’l shaken,
They shout a joyful word.
Perchance in the Marquesas,
Perchance off Pago’s peaks,
As day night’s spell releases,
The leaping trade wind speaks.
The Trades are always blowing,
For God has made it so,
To help the sailors going
Wherever they must go.
And, oh! the trade wind, singing
To palm or white-capped sea,
Is like an old song bringing
The old days back to me.

Kissing the Capitalists.
BY ARTHUR W. UPFIELD
ALF THE NARK was a bush cook
with an unbreakable habit of
throwing off his apron and jump-
ing on it when his cheque was three
months old and thirty pounds high.
We met, not for the first time, in the
smallest bar in Australia, where but five
men could drink at once, where the land-
lord’s front adipose was kept pressed to
the counter in order that his rear adipose
should not sweep the bottles oft' the
shelves.
At the moment of meeting, Alf the
Nark was speechless. When he greeted
me he was on his feet, his body was
steady, his eyes were wide open and his
mind seemingly alert; yet he was speech-
less. His jaws moved ; so did his tongue ;
but he was unable to utter so much as
a whisper. Always after his third drink
he became speechless. This was a great
pity. Sober, his anecdotes were memor-
able ; what they would have been like
when watered with whisky caused one
to sigh as though bereaved.
The smallest bar in Australia was at
Pooncarie, on the Darling. For three
weeks we lived in that bar by day, and
by night slept with the centipedes on the
woodheap. Only towards the dawn of
each day did Alf the Nark regain lingual
control for an hour or so —until the bar
was again opened.
The parting had to come eventually—
from Australia’s smallest bar. Broke,
we rolled along the track northward to
Menindie, our gunny-sacks filled by the
publican’s wife and the publican’s
pockets filled with our money. Now and
then Alf the Nark would halt, lay a
restraining hand on my arm and emo-
tionally endeavor to talk. It was evident
that some matter of great import weighed
heavily on his mind. His black eyes
ringed with crimson reflected the anguish
created by his disability. Then, resign-
edly, he would march on, leaving me to
stagger after him, my mind filled with
forebodings.
After many strenuous efforts to regain
speech victory was finally achieved when
he placed his hands on my shoulders and
said earnestly:
“Hug yer chains, lad! Fear ’em not,
but hug yer chains.”
Thinking he referred to the chains cast
around us slaves by the capitalists, I
grunted acquiescence, and lurched on by
his side with the feeling that something
was behind me, dogging my footsteps —
something I dared not turn round to
face.
“Fear ’em not, but hug yer Chains,
lad. H"*? ’em and kiss ’em. Thev won’t
hurt. Don’t knock ’em orf. Hug ’em
ana kiss 'em, ana you’ll be free or ’em
the quicker.”
Glancing at his profile I noted with
particular clarity his Roman nose and
the point of his long chin protruding be-
tween the black hairs of his drooping
moustache. I could make nothing of
his philosophy, for I had never feared
the capitalists, and thought lightly of
their chains cast about me, but I did
bar hugging and kissing any capitalist
of any race and creed. Presently he
said, with a “Hail, - Hitler!” kind of
salute:
“You see, I don’t fight ’em. I lets ’em
alone. ’E thinks Vs teasing me, frighten-
ing me, and ’e’s disappointed ’cos I don’t
knock ’im orf. Hug yer chains. Hug
’em and kiss ’em.”
Engaged with my own more pressing
problem, the almost irresistible tempta-
tion to look behind, and restrained only
by the fear of what I might see follow-
ing me, I no longer pondered on the
incongruity of kissing the capitalists.
Together we trudged from river-bend to
river-bend.
Never did shipwrecked mariners want
a drink more direfully. To drink water
was then impossible. To stop to boil
the billy was equally impossible. If I
did stop the thing behind me would
catch up and jump on my back. There
was a mob of horses standing in the
shade of several wind-tortured box-
trees ; there were sheep panting in the
shade of a sandalwood-tree growing on
a sand-bar stabbing the flank of the
river, and even the blowflies were swarm-
ing in the shade made by the occasional
old man saltbush. To me the shade was
forbidden by the thing forcing me ever
onward, and Alf was too occupied with
kissing the capitalists and .hugging them
to notice the heat.
“Look at this one crawling up me
arm,” he said presently. “See, I’m not
frightened of ’im. He might ’ave two
’eads and six lobster claws with two eyes
to each claw, and he might be painted
yaller and blue, but ’e don’t frighten me.
I’m not knocking ’im orf for im to
holler for ’is mates. No, not me. 1
got more sense. ‘Hug ’em and kiss em,
says I.”
Only then did it dawn on me that he
had not been referring to the capitalists.
When with song I tried to charm away
the thing at my heels Alf the Nark
determinedly assisted, but at length the
torture became unendurable, and with
a yell I sprang round —to see nothing but
the grey track winding away into the
dark green of the river box-trees.
“Now, now, ’Ampshire,” implored my
fellow-sinner. “Now, now, hug yer
chains. Kiss ’em. Don’t let ’em think
you’re afraid.”
The sun was westering when again we
came to the river to select a temporary
camp site at which to boil the billy and
eat a little. We both knew that to stop
for any length of time would be impos-
sible that night. We stood above the
river, the like of which no other country
can show. Steep and deep the banks
appear, as though fashioned by man
with giant scoops, so evenly sloped and
so straight are they between the bends.
The stream was low and the banks
were as slippery as grease. We each held
an empty billy and a canvas water-bag.
Our tongues were swollen with thirst, and
the kookaburras mocked our distress.
To attempt to reach the water in our
weakened condition would have resulted
in sliding into the river, and our chances
of getting out again would have been
equal to those of a mouse in a half-filled
bucket of water.
“You’re the youngest,” Alf the Nark
truthfully said. “I’d get to the water
all right, but me ’ands shakes so that
I’d spill all of it outer the billy.”
I pictured myself crawling up the in-
clined grease-board of a bank, present-
ing the thing ever behind me with a
wonderful opportunity ; and, like a man
reprieved, I sighed relief when Alf
pointed out a fallen tree sprawled down
the bank further up the river.
Like the banks the water was dull
grey. Twilight was swiftly tinting it to
molten silver. The rings made by the
jumping fish moved outward sluggishly,
too sluggishly for our throbbing eyes
to follow them. Beside the tree roots
we argued which should go down to
the water, finally agreeing on both going
down —Alf to protect my back. All the
kookaburras in the Western Division
were gibing at us.
The going was easy until we reached
the level of the last rise. Without the
tree branches no man could have pro-
ceeded without shooting down into the
river. Hearing Alf s grunts behind me,
knowing my rear was well guarded, inch
by inch I neared the blessed water, until
at long last I sought for firm foothold
whilst I filled the water-bag from the
billy. Then I saw lying along the
branch to which I clung a five-foot
diamond-marked snake.
“Hug ’em and fear not, ’Ampshire,”
urged my partner from close behind.
“Don’t let ’im think you’re afraid. ’E’s all
right. Them kind never bites. I’ve
’andled ’em many a time.”
“Look out! Don't touch it,” 1 yelled.
“Now, now,” said the crooning voice
behind me. A hand on the end of a
hairy forearm slid over my shoulder.
The hand gripped the snake behind its
head, and withdrew it from the branch
across my shoulder. Fearful of relaxing
hold on the branch, for several seconds
I could do nothing. “Now, now. It’s all
jake. You mustn’t be afraid of ’em. Hug
’em and kiss ’em.”
It had looked so real, that snake, and
even as I filled the water-bag I wondered
how Alf the Nark could distinguish be-
tween the “capitalists” and the real thing.
Comforted by his presence at my back.
I completed the task, and together we
laboriously climbed back to the high
ground.
Presently the flames of the fire were
wrapped comfortingly around the billy-
I sat on my swag with my back againyt
a sapling, secure from rear attacks. Ah
the Nark squatted on his heels beyond
the fire, trying unsuccessfully to cut chips
from an evil-looking tobacco plug.
Then through the hot air 1 saw the
snake’s head wriggling out from Alts
shirt, and, when I heaved myself into $
crouching position to spring away from
it, he noticed my anxiety. Laying dow.ii
the plug and the knife, he deliberately
drew the reptile partly from his shirt and
kissed its head. _ .

not to take too much notice of ’em. Hug
yer chains and kiss ’em, 1 says. You see,
this here snake ain’t vicious-like. What
we sees now we don’t see ordinary times.
Consekently these sort don’t bite. They
ain t dangerous. Once I ’ad a little nigger
baby what insisted on ridin’ on me
shoulder and tuggin’ at me ’air. Did I
bash ’im? No, I didn’t. 1 just let ’im
stay there as though I was enjoying it.
If I ad bashed ’im ’e’d ’ave come back
with all is relations. Don’t I know ’em!”
Did you ever have anything spring
on to your back, and wind its arms round
your neck and throttle you?” 1 inquired
plaintively.
"No,” he replied with conviction. “But
I ve ad em crawl up inside me trouser-
leg, squirm up past me belt, and come
out ol me shirt collar to wriggle round
me neck and go inter me ’ead through
an ear’ole. Even then 1 took no notice ;
not even when he sang yims and The
Face on the Bar-room Floor’ for hours
and hours. It don’t do to notice ’em.
“I did once on the track outer Wanaar-
ing, but never again. I lorst me block
and fought one what was like a football
with all eyes and no part on ’im where
a mouth could be. Like a fool 1 knocked
im orf me, and I jumped ’igh and came
down on ’im with both boots. You
ought to ’ave ’eard ’im holler. I dropped
me swag and bolted, and every now and
then I looked back to see ’undreds of
millions like ’im rolling along the track
after me. No, ’Ampshire, I never fights
em now. I ’ugs ’em an’ kisses ’em.”
We ate and drank in the ruddy fire-
light; the bullfrogs, a mopoke and a
party of ducks our orchestra. Afterwards
we smoked. In earnest Alf the Nark
battled wtih the demon of despondency
which rode me, but which was of less
importance than the demon waiting for
me on the other side of the tree against
which I pressed my back.
When the moon came up we slipped
into our harness and followed the track.
I implored my partner to walk behind
me. 1 knew that the thing had instantly
taken its position there immediately I left
the guarding tree. Obligingly, Alf the
Nark did so.
Once we stopped to boil the billy an 1
to rest for an hour, when my partner
gained another opportunity to discuss the
peculiar mannerisms of the “capitalists.' 5
We boiled the billy again at dawn. All
that morning we continued to tramp unt I
we reached a shearing-shed about noop.
Utterly exhausted, we lay down on the
wool-room floor, the swags for pillow .
We slept.
1 awoke at sundown. The Thing n )
longer was behind me, no longer threat-
ened to catch up with me and pounce.
Alf the Nark was sleeping placidly. The
point of his long chin, protrudin’
upward from his mandarin-like mour-
tache, was like a bare hill rising from dark
scrub. A diamond-headed snake was half-
way out of the open neck of his shirt.
With a stick I managed to get it right
out.
It was dead.
It had been killed by the kookaburras
at the very least four days previously.
Algy.
BY CON DREW.
IT was after I’d left the ring for good
and was teachin’ boxin’ in a gym. in
Surry Hills that 1 first hooked up
with Algy.
I’m workin’ off a little steam with a
punchin’-ball one mornin’, when in drifts
a gent, who looked as if he had just
come away from a drawin’-room bridge
party. His togs were cut in the latest
style, and on his hurricane deck he wore
a lid that would have done credit to a
corn-doctor. Between the cuffs of his
pants and a pair of polished tans 1 got
a glimpse of heliotrope socks.
It didn’t take no second-sight to see
that he was a front-ranker in a smart
set, and I wondered what he was doin’
so far out of bounds.
He shoots a quick glance round the
joint and ambles over to me.
“Mr. Silver?” he asks.
“That’s me.”
“Let me introduce myself,” says he.
“I’m Algernon Dunne-Smith.”
As soon as he told me his name 1
placed him. The Dunne-Smiths' were
high cards in the Sydney society pack.
There was an ancestor who sold wooden
bullets or somethin’ in the Crimean War,
and their financial resources was said to
be unlimited. Algy had earned a repu-
tation for mixin’ cocktails and spendin’
money. He was a fast mover in the
fastest set in Sydney.
“I’m glad to know you,” says I. So 1
was.
Algy squats himself down on a chair
and peels off one of his gloves.
“I wish to take a private course for
a fortnight,” says he.
“Boxin’ or gymnasium?”
“Boxin’,” says Algy. “I think I’d
better explain.” And then he gives me
a framework of what he’s got on his
mind.
It seems that he and another swell
duck had got into some sort of an argu-
ment over somethin’ which led to high
words. Both of them reckoned them-
selves insulted. I had a suspicion that
there was a bit of muslin in the back-
ground, but I never found out the true
cause of the disagreement. Anyway, they
both agreed that there was only one way
to settle the difference, and that was with
the gloves.
I see,” says I. “When is this war
goin’ to take place?”
In a fortnight. I thought you might
be able to instil a little boxin’ knowledge
into me in the meantime. Beyond a bout
or two with my friends I am totally in-
experienced.”
° ‘‘T-U
the time is rather short,” says I, “but
somethin’ might be done. What weight
is the gent, you are goin’ to annihilate?”
He s about half a stone heavier than
me, answers Algy, who went about
deven-stun four. “I’m afraid he knows
a good deal more about fisticuffs than I
cjo.
’: “P h > w ? 11 ” says I, “the race ain’t always
to the swift, as Nat Gould says. I know
a little thump or two that ain’t exactly
in the rules that are always pretty effec-
tive when the referee ain’t lookin’.
There’s the shoulder punch, for instance
Now”
Algy looked shocked and held up hi:
hand. “Mr. Silver," he said, “you
are surely not suggestin’ that I shoulc.
employ a blow that is not provided foi
in the rules of boxin’? I wouldn’t enter-
tain the idea for a minute. I reallj
wouldn’t.”
You could see that he meant it, too.
That’s the funny part of it. There’s nc
accountin’ for them swells.
“Just as you like,” says I. “Still, a
little guile, if used in moderation, don’;
do no one no harm. I thought you
wanted to win, but we’ll let that go.
Where is the affray goin’ to be held?”
“We propose to hold it here if you
are agreeable.”
“I’m agreeable,” s&ys I.
I hen Algy and me got down to busi
ness, and I don’t mind fellin’ you tha;
the terms agreed on were very satisfac-
tory to me. He was no mean cow, wa:
Algy.
That’s settled then,” he says, puttin
back his fountain pen. “I’ll start on m>
course of instruction to-morrer.” Then
he shakes hands and breezes off.
He was back at ten to the tick next
mornin’, and we started on our two
weeks’ trainin’. He was green, all right,
but game. Durin’ our various spars I
gave him some solid taps, and he took
them all without a squeal. He could
hit pretty hard when he got a sittin’ shot
at you. Nothin’ that would stun a
seasoned man, though.
Every second day 1 took, him over to
Centennial Park for a little leg work. He
liked them walks, as he called them. He
said that the open air and the contempla-
tion of nature had opened his eyes to the
imperfections of city life, or somethin’
like that. He had some fine poetic
thoughts, had Algy.
He didn’t make much progress in his
boxin’, though. In certain departments
of the game his ignorance was appallin’.
I began to get a wee bit worried.
“If the gent, in the opposin’ camp
knows anything about boxin’,” says I to
myself, “Algy won’t be in the race.”
I’d have felt a lot more contented if
he had let me teach him how to use his
elbow in a clinch and one or two other
useful aids to boxin’ that I knew of. No;
him! Every time I tried to introdooce a
wallop that wasn’t firmly screwed into the
rules, he jibbed.
“No, Mr. Silver,” he’d say. “We
mustn’t do nothin’ that savors of un-
fairness. This bout that I’m goin’ to
engage in is an affair between gentlemen."
You’d have thought I was askin’ him
to compound a felony!
If I’d been goin’ to referee the scrap
everythink would have been O.K., but I
wasn’t. They’d arranged for one of
their friends to act as third man in the
ring. I was up agen a brick wall.
I did my best with him, of course, and
when the afternoon of the scrap come
round he was in fairly good nick.

S. H. PRIOR MEMORIAL PRIZE
To recognise the services to Australian literature of the late Samuel
Henry Prior, editor of “The Bulletin” for 18 years, his son, H. K. Prior,
has provided £100 per annum for a prize, to be known as the S. H. Prior
Memorial Prize, which will be awarded every year for a work of fiction.
Entries for the first competition will close on June 6, 1935, and results
will be announced within two months thereafter.
The trustees, who will supply all relevant information to intending
competitors on application, will publish the successful work, together with
any others which they may deem worthy. The winning novel will be published
within two months after the announcement of the results.
Royalties at the usual rates will be paid on sales of works so published,
in which the entrants will retain ail property rights, except world book rights,
which will be controlled by the trustees.
Any bona-fide Australian resident or any person born in Australia,
New Zealand or British South Pacific islands will be eligible to enter, for
the competition, novels which must be the original work of the entrant and
previously unpublished, either wholly or in part, in book or serial form.
Manuscripts must be submitted under a nom de plume, and the true name and
address of the author must accompany each entry in a sealed envelope, which
will not be opened until the judges have made their decision.
The judges’ selections will be final, and competitors must accept as
binding the trustees’ decisions on other matters arising out of the contest.
The trustees, whose address is 252 George-street, Sydney, reserve the
right to withhold the prize if no novel submitted is, in the opinion of the
judges, worthy of an award.
About two o’clock the gent, from the
opposin’ camp arrives, escorted by about
a dozen friends. They introdooced him
to me as Mr. Charles K. Fieldgood, and
1 sized him up for a chap who might
be fairly slick on his feet.
I showed him into his dressin’-room,
and the others draped themselves around
the ring in some chairs I’d borrered for
the occasion.
Then Algy blows in with a tribe of
well-wishers. A tony lot, if you know what
1 mean. I was wishin’ Shakspeare Harry
or some of them fellers was there to get
a feed of the company I was keepin’.
There was no animosity shown between
the rival camps. They smiled and nodded
to one another for all the world as if
they were at a bridge party.
While the ref. was makin’ a few after-
dinner remarks to the audience about
how the debate was to be conducted 1
put the gloves on Algy. When I’d laced
them up I seen him give a squint at
the paddin’, and 1 laughed.
“Not lookin’ for a horseshoe, are you,
Mr. Algy?” I says.
“No, Mr. Silver,” he grinned ; “I
hardly expected to find a horseshoe.”
Still, says 1 with a wink, a little
guile
“Might help, you were goin’ to say,”
laughs Algy. That is a point I think
we have agreed to differ on.
Just then the ref. gave the signal to
get ready, and 1 stripped oft Algy s
dressm-gown. . , • .
“Good luck!” says I, pushin’ him to-
wards the centre of the ring; and in
another second they had started on their
journey.
Although the go didn’t last long, 1
must admit it was willin’. Algy com-
menced hostilities by plantin’ a range-
finder behind Charles’s ear. He followed
it up with another wild swing but this
time Charles saw it cornin. He stepped
aside and as Algy sailed by propelled
by the weight of his swrng he stopped
a dmnyhayser with his jaw.
It nettled Algy, and he sailed in at
Charles with both arms going like a
windmill. Charles didn t need no mvi-
tation to join in the fun. As Algy came
hotfoot towards him he stepped in to
meet him, and there was quite an excitin’
time for several seconds.
In a mix-up in our corner Algy got
jambed with his back agen the ropes,
He stopped a lot of thumps before he
managed to get clear. The affray then
drifted to the middle of the ring, with
both men sloggin’ for all they were
worth. There was a lot of missin and
jumpin’ about; but I could see that
Charles knew more about the game than
Algy. His punches were neater, and
someone had taught him how to use his
a bit.
That left began to worry Algy. It met
him nearly every time he dashed in, and
put him out of his stride.
As soon as Charles woke up to the
fact that Algy was open to a straight
left, that was the turnin’ of the tide. He
never gave Algy a second’s peace. “Bang,
bang” would go the left agen in Algy’s
face and. chin, and his head would snap
like a piece of elastic. Charles peppered
Algy with the left so often that his
friends said afterwards it was a wonder
how he managed to stand up to it. It
was marvellous, they said.
[ signalled to Algy to cover his chin ;
but it wasn’t a bit of use. He just
wouldn’t keep that glove up.
And SQ | be de b a te went on, with Algy
swallowin’ lefts until about half a minute
before the bell went for corners,
The end came suc )den, as it always
does when mugs are scrappin’. The pair
bad been scrambling in mid-ring, when
Charles, who was gettin’ a wee bit care-
less, forgot to cover his chin. Algy had
put a punch in motion. It was one of
them wild swings of his, and, after sailing
half-way round the world, it landed fair
on Charles’s chin. It shook him from
truck to keel, and I seen the pupils of
his eyes shoot upwards until only the
whites were showin’.

There was great handshakin’ all round,
and it must have been more than a
quarter of an hour before I could drag
Algy away from his friends.
After he had a shower and a rub-down
we adjourned to the den I called my
office, and Algy wrote me out a cheque
for twenty quid. I thought it mighty
generous, considerin’ that he’d given me
a cheque the first day I met him, and
t q |d him so.
"Not at all, Mr. Silver,” says Algy.
"You have been extremely kind and
patient with me. If it hadn’t been for
your careful trainin’ I should never have
stood up to Mr. Fieldgood’s blows.”
“You think it was thei trainin’ did it?”
“I’m positive it was, said Algy, shakin
hands. “And now, if you will excuse me,
I’ll go and join my friends. And then

About an hour later, when Algy and

Misleading' Advertisements.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
THIS world is full of disappointments.
The salesman was all attention
when I began to talk to him. I
thought everything was settled when T
had selected the furniture —it took about
an hour of my valuable time.
“Now whereabouts is the home?” I
asked.
“We can deliver anywhere,” he replied.
“You mean to saylyou cam supply me
with three rooms in Darling Point at
this price?” I cried, astonished.
He went blank and cold suddenly.
“What arc you talking about?” he
snapped. “We supply the furniture, which
will be sent to your address”
“I haven’t any address. I’m relying
on you,” I retorted. “Your advertisement
says ‘Home of Three Rooms Furnished
for £35 Complete,’ and”
He was quite hot about it ; but so was
I. I told him I had suspected all along
that there was some catch in it.
Then there was the man in the tailor’s
shop. Immediately I had chosen my
material he commenced to measure me,
starting with my shoulders.
“I don’t wear my pants around my
neck,” 1 said —“not since I left off wear-
ing my father’s cast-offs.”
“But for the suit” he began.
“I don’t want a suit,” I said firmly.
“All I came for was one of those extra
trousers which, according to your adver-
tisement, are free”——
That was as far as I got; he was even
more insulting than the furniture sales-
man. Although I felt dispirited when I left
him that did not prevent me from visit-
ing the moneylender who advertised
loans without security. He seemed taken
aback when to his inquiry, “How much
is it you want?” I replied “How much
have you got?” The interview was most
unsatisfactory, and I left with a few com-
ments about his lying ads.
The lottery-shares office that under-
took to give £714 for a shilling was like-
wise a disappointment; it refused even
to meet me when 1 offered to take £2O
on account. And it kept my bob, giving
me only a little slip of paper in return.
“You arrange funerals?” I said to the
last person I interviewed. He started
to tell me all about it, talking a great
deal about due reverence, but 1 cut him
short.
“I want you to arrange mine,” I said,
and as he gaped at me I went on: “Y’see,
I’m fed up with things, but I haven’t the
nerve to take my own life. I’ll leave
the arrangement entirely to you” .
I found myself out in the street with a
conviction that the only truthful adver-
tisement was the one inserted by my wife
before we were married. She used the
words “view mat.” I’ve been on the
mat ever since.

PYORRHEA
Creeps Upon Its Victims
Unawares
IT is the pernicious nature of pyorrhea to infect the mouth as long as ten
years before the victim knows it. This dread disease of the gums comes
to four people out of five past 40.
Not content with robbing humanity of half of all adult teeth lost, it also
breeds virulent poisons which it sends coursing throughout the entire system
to undermine the individual’s general health.
Starting at the “tartar line,” where teeth meet gums, the infection works
down the roots; and often before it is recognised pyorrhea becomes so
deeply entrenched that all the skill of your dentist is called for to save your
teeth and health.
DON’T WAIT FOR WARNING; START
USING FORHAN’S NOW
Usually pyorrhea creeps on us unawares. Don’t wait for those fearsome
warnings, tenderness and bleeding gums. Once established, pyorrhea cannot
be healed by Forhan’s or any other toothpaste. That’s why it is far wiser
to protect and prevent before the trouble starts. See your dentist HOW
and visit him at least twice a year regularly.
And in your home brush your teeth and massage your gums, morning
and night, with Forhan’s. This remarkable dentifrice is unique in that it
contains Forhan’s Pyorrhea Astringent, an ethical preparation, developed by
Dr. R. J. Forhan, which thousands of dentists use in the treatment of pyorrhea.
The Forhan formula was the outgrowth of Dr. Forhan’s 26 years of speciali-
sation in the treatment of this disease.
GUARD THE TEETH YOU HAVE
Countless people to-day are self-conscious and unhappy with false teeth.
Don’t risk the danger of losing your teeth. They are a priceless possession
and deserve the finest care. Start with Forhan’s to-day. It is as fine a dentifrice
as money can buy. Yap can make no wiser investment in the health of your
mouth and the safety of your teeth.
Obtainable from all Chemists and High-class Stores, or will bei sent post free
upon receipt of the price by the Australasian Agents, The Sheldon Drug Co.,

“Psalmist of the Dawn,”
By MARY MARLOWE.
There are few settings left in the world
that some novelist or other has not used,
but for this charming romance Miss
Marlowe has found one of them. Her
story, from the bustle and feverishness
of city life, moves quickly to Lord Howe
Island, palm-crested speck in the Pacific
which is a romance in itself. Miss Mar-
lowe knows her islanders intimately:
remote from the world’s hurly-burly;
characteristically ruled over by Three Wise
Men; altogether about the happiest people
on earth. The real and yet almost fairy-
tale island atmosphere gives the novel a
refreshing distinction, a compelling touch
of difference.
“Psalmist of the Dawn,” by Mary Marlowe, is now on sale at
all bookstalls and newsagents. Published by The Endeavour
Press, 252 George Street, Sydney.
An Endeavour Press Book. Price 4j6 (postage 3d.).
