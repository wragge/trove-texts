With Thanks to Bishop Barry.
We have not, it is now apparent, been out-
rageously ahead of our times in placing
prominently before our readers, as we re-
cently commenced to do, the growing im-
portance of Socialism. On all hands evi-
dence multiplies that the Socialistic theories
are destined to engage the chief attention of
economists and statesmen, and that from
their consideration something — whether
something momentous or merely something
trifling, certainly something interesting-
will be accomplished. By accomplished, we
mean carried into practical effect. As one
example of the overwhelming influence of
the rising system of thought, we may refer
to the fact that, for the very first time in
the history of ecclesiastioism in Australia,
Socialism was, on theld’h inst., alluded to
by a Christian clergyman in terms of serious
respect, and without any ebullition of abuse
and misrepresentation. In his address at
the meeting to inaugurate a Christian Evi-
dence Society, Dr. Barrv, Anglican Primate
of Australia, used these remarkable expres-
sions—remarkable because, up to the mo-
ment of his speaking, no man and no journal
which makes respect for “law and order,”
and “ the existing constitution of society,”
and “the approval of all right-thinking
people” its mottoes and rules of thought
haye ever mentioned Socialism, save to re-
vile the very name. Listen: —
“ He had observed, for instance, atnon? the work-
ing classes at home—he had not enough experience
to know how itmijht be here—that their aliena-
tion from Christian faith was due very much to
this—that they did not see that Christianity dealt
with those great questions which mainly occupied
their attention in life. They thought, for example,
that it gave no light upon the rights and powers
and the advancing privileges which grew up under
the democratic condition of society, in which
their hearts were so much bound up. They thought
it did not touch upon the great questions of So-
cialism, which now, in various degrees, were af-
fecting the minds of working men of all other
civilised countries. They thought Christianity
had nothing to do with material progress; that It
noglectod the body and the present life because Its
whole attention was fixed upon the soul and the
life to come."
Bishop Barry has, we have every reason to
believe —reading, as we do with interest, the
“rags” which the Avorking classes in Eng-
land mainly look to for exposition of ideas
in sympathy with their own : “rags” which
such papers as the Times or the S.M. Herald
nev er even allude to—correctly defined the
sentiments of the British working men in
this particular. And dare he say that the
working men have not justly thought all
that he alleges? Dare he deny that among
the influences which have fostered the mon-
strous growth of privilege and class-rob-
bery, the Church to which he belongs—the
State Church of England, the Church whose
head-bonzes are nobles, and whose second-
rate priests are aristocrats, and allied to the
rich by being themselves rich—has not been
among the ohiefest?
• • c
Even to-day the priests of his Church who
have opened their hearts and understandings
to the revived political gospel of the poor
can be counted on the fingers of one man's
hands, while the number whose proud sto-
machs rise at the very word “Socialism”
are comparatively as the sands of the sea.
The warning of Bishop Barry is a word in
season- Of a surety, except Christian minis-
ters and Christian churches will fairly deal
with, and, where just, adopt, the politics of
the poor and oppressed, Christianity will b?-
oome ere long that moribund thing, the re-
ligion of Patricians—or,Tather, to substitute
modern terms, the religion of property-
owners and of employers of labour. This
menacing truth seems to have flashed—
brightly or dimly, we know not—upon
Bishop Barry. Its piercing rays are awaken-
ing clerical sleepers elsewhere, just as
their reddening of the political horizon
sent, the other day, three Emperors to
huddle together and scheme how the judg-
ment of God, and the demand of my-
riad voices for the right to live in com-
fort and decency, could be eluded and
denied. Here in Australia it is not the
Anglican Church which represents the
wealthiest sect. The Congregationalists
comprise far more of our wealthy lower
orders. Accordingly it is the Anglican
Bishop who speaks the first decent word of
recognition, and Congregationalism which
is the stronghold of opulent bourgeois de-
termination to refuse to hear or to cease to
curse. But, in England, where the social con-
dition here prevailing is reversed as regards
the two Churches; where, to quote an Eng-
lish Tory paper, commenting on a matter
presently to be refered to, “Congregation-
alism is essentially democratic, but its ad-
herents have been always for the most part
people of the lower middle class,” it is from
Congregationalism that the voice issues.
• • •
In the City Temple, in presence of the
Congregational Union, the delegates num-
bering upwards of sixteen hundred, the
Chairman, Dr. Parker, delivered the in-
augural address; an address which has set
all the papers talking, and most of them, as
becomes organs of the wealthier orders,
sneering. Of the delivery of this remark-
able address, it is noteworthy that in New
South Wales the S.M. Herald, the organ of
bourgeois Congregationalism, and ordinary
lavish of space to give publicity to matters
connected with its Church, gives its readers
but the slightest hint. Dr. Barker’s ad-
dress was on the subject of “The Larger
Ministry.” As introduction, he suggested
“ That possibly the Ministry which Christ meant
them to exercise In the world might have a larger
function than some of them supposed, ....
Christ always began at the point of social pres-
sure.”
Upon the question of territorialism, he ob-
served, towards the conclusion of his paper 1
“That the land could not always be held as it
was (held in England this day, ... As a work-
ing man, and he was not ashamed of the title, he
believed that ono day It would be possible for
thorn to have the honest use, on equitable
terms—a use guaranteed by ownership—of more
land than would be required for a grave
There was something more than mere property in
the world. Whatever property they acquired they
would acquire justly. No public burglary would
they abet or sanction. They would not degrade
the dukes, but would raise the common people.
The peasant should be taught Its history, have a
voice in its destinies, and a stake in the fortune of
his country. But, in working towards such ends,
they must never forget that Christian Socialism
was no easy problem, and that social inequalities
wore not to be adjusted by the rule of thumb. Let
them be on their guard lest the word ’ Christian ’
be only the handle with which the knife * (Social-
ism ’ was worked. Their hope was in education,
and in the mental enlightenment which accom-
panied It. Their duty, as religious Churches and
Christian teachers, was to show that the morality
of the Cross was as sublime as its theology, and
that no land was worth having that was not ac-
quired honestly and tilled industriously. Duke-
doms and earldoms had no future. His assurance
was in the eternal, and his faith in the Son of Man.
Ip the golden age of a Christianised humanity,
which was pledged by the oath of God, when the
great dukes were as forgotten as Dukes Teman,
Omar, and Zepho, the land would be honestly
held, and cultivated into plentiful harvests by peo-
ple who had heard a great voice from Heaven
saying, ‘The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness
thereof.’ ”
• • •
There is certainly a cautious vagueness in
this pronunclamcnto, startling as it is con-
sidering the quarter whence it proceeds,
which seems to indicate that Dr. Parker
reserves the right to cry-back if convenient.
He commits himself to no definite plan of
reconstructing society and sweeping away

• * *
Respecting the significance of such an
utterance from a Christian minister, we
have already remarked. But it appears that
in Dr. Barker’s case a double signification is
involved. From the comments of a London
paper we gather that the Rev. Doctor is a
highly paid and somewhat popularity-hunt-
ing divine: one of those who are only daring
leaders when powerfully propelled from be-
hind. According to this paper,
« Ur. Parkier is a kind of Clerical Times, and
his Utterances indicate roughly the amount of
pressure on the social barometer. It is not many
years ago that he used his pulpit in the City Temple
to make an attack upon Trade Unions; now he
takes up a strong position as a Land Reformer.
We apprehend that both now and formerly his
Utterances represent to a. considerable extent
earnest middle-class opinion. ... He discerns the
drift of nubile opinion, and, being devoid of social
superstition, he is quite ready to march abreast
therewith.”
From this it may be inferred that middle-
class opinion in England|on“the subject of
property in land has been sensibly affected
by the philosophy of which Henry George
is the latest and greatest prophet. But, after
all, this amounts merely to a restricted and
specialised Communism. At the same Con-
gregational Union, however, downright So-
cialism did not lack an exponent. The Rev.
G. 8. Rbaney read a paper onlthe Relations
bf the Churches to recent Movements of
Thought in regard to the Social and Moral
Condition of the Poor ; —
“Having depleted the extreme prevalence of
poverty in LondonlheTasked, IWhy this poverty?
Why, because tens of thousands are underpaid
find overworked, and have not got, and do not get
their share of the profits of their own toil. Who
had made, or rather got, the money of late ? Hav-
ing quoted Mr. Gtffen, he observed that Mr. Mtu>
fiEAti says the 2 046,000 families possess £7,563,000,000,
Or £3700 per family, and that 4,629,000 possess only
£378,000,000, or £00 per family, and that of these
Mch families] 223,500 families possess £5,738,000,000
Of £26,000 per family. Then descending to details,
Mr. Heaney stated that a bootmaker makes a pair
bt fishing-boots, for which he gets 5s. 3d., of course
hot providing the material; they sell at £3 3s. A
Woman makes one dozen pinafores for 8d., and
they sell for 7s. 9d. She makes a shirt for 3J4d.,
and spoiling it is made to pay 3s. 3d. Another
lhakes a shirt for %d., which is sold for Is. 6%d. Is
that by the visitation of Providence ? Is that a
high necessity of modern trade ? Is that the sort
Of distribution of wages that can be Justified at
the bar of conscience and of God ! In London
250,000 girls were earning less than 10s. per week,
and match girls were making 1296 boxes for Is.
Let them think of it, investors who were promised
10 per cent. Then let them think of what a thief
can make; think of what can be made any night in
the street, within sight of the homes in which the
white slaves live, suffer, and die—ay, die, rather
than steal or sin. What, Mr. Heaney next asked
is the remedy ? It is hard to find a remedy in our
present system of trade. He did not think they
would find a remedy so long as they acted upon
ft brutal political economy, that teaches Christian
men of business to say “ that 5 they know
nothing of philanthropy in business; that every
man looking after himself will be the best
for all; and that competition makes the mar-
ket price, and not the fair sal© of the work
done. Better the Commuve than a law of politi-
cal economy that worhs\in such wise. Take the
oases he had mentioned—common Justice de-
manded that the boot-maker, the match-maker,
the shirt-maker, ought to have a fuller wage out
Of the ultimate price made by the man for whom
they toil, early and late, lor starvation wages. To
that the answer was made, * Other men will do the
Work for less; why should we give more than the
market price?’ Market price! What is that?
•Take it or starve,’ and take it they must. But
was that the rule of Christian men in business, not
to estimate the worker’s wage fairly, but to force
a lower price, with the alternative of no work, no
bread, no home—the street, the workhouse, or the
river ? As to the cry that ‘ If we do this we shal]
be ruined,’ he quoted Mr. Fawcett as to the suc-
cess of profit-sharing methods of trade. This was
a dangerous question, he reminded the meeting,
In conclusion, and ho appealed to the Church to
take it up and deal with it on the principles of
CUBIST.”
* • •
It is somewhat odd to observe that almost
Simultaneously a Lord Bishop, Magee of
Peterborough, while evincing his conscious-
ness of the tremor in the social atmosphere
by remarking at a conference of the Peter-
borough Diocesan Council that
“ they could not put it more simply or more clearly
than this—that it was idle to expect men to lead
the lives of Caristlans when they had the houses of
brutes,”
repeating, parrot-like, the old conventional
chatter of the “ brutal political economy”
which the Congregationalist parson de-
nounced, and which the Socialist writers
are bent on controverting, the hopeless and
heartless half-truth, that
“if they could establish to-morrow at the cost of
the State comfortable and cheap abodes for all the
labouring people of London, they would do more
to pauperise that city than anything else. Labour
Would flow to the place where comfortable abodes
and cheap residences were provided. This would
lead to a reduction of wages as well as an Increase
in the rates, both Of them thfe direct result of un-
wise interference on the part of the State.”
And dll this antique gabble in sublime un-
consciousness that its purport has been
analysed and its significance converted from
an excuse for monopoly into a reason for
condemning monopoly. Not less curious is
it to note this same Lord Bishop explicitly
recommending in his innocence exactly
what the keener-sighted plebeian parson
had specified as a dangerous complication.
Dr. Parker said in a warning sense that
“ It is easy to excite the spirit of discontent, but
this need not prevent us promoting the justice due
to every creature of the living God.”
Bishop Magee, with extraordinary courage,
or else extraordinary unconsciousness of the
nature of his recommendation, declared
that—
“ The Church, which dealt with Individual man
and not with men in the mass as did politicians,
could do much to improve the condition of the
people by making the individual man discontented
with his dwelling and his surroundings, and by
helping him in the struggle to improve them.”
Should the Church adopt this plan, it will
find itself working shoulder to shoulder with
very strange collaborators. What the Bishop
indicates as a proper function of the Church,
the Socialist writers have been busily en-
gaged in for some time past, and the Con-
servative organs and leaders have been
desperately condemning and endeavouring
to counteract. Conceive, for example, our
Sydney Morning Herald addressing itself
to the enterprise of making the masses dis-
contented with the prevailing adjustment
of conditions!
• 9 •
But the Bishop of Peterborough seems to
us to have blundered on a truth, of which,
also, our own Primate has evinced a misty
consciousness. There has commenced a Social
movement of such enormous magnitude that
not merely the people of one nation or one
continent, but all civilised communities,
participate in it. The surging multitude is
looking around for leaders. Stand still, it
cannot and will not. Its motion is an intel-
lectual impulse ripened by the fruition of
thoughts and conditions long maturing, and
propelled by Almighty power. Leaders have
already presented themselves, in the persons
of the Socialist philosophers and propo-
gandists, till recently accounted as vain
babblers and men accursed. If the Church-
men refuse to bestir themselves and hurry
up to recover lost ground, they will
be left behind for good and all. The
Christianity of the last two hundred years—
that complaisant servant of the patrician
and the wealthy—has had its day, Chris-
tianity is once more about to cast its skin,
as it did in the days of the Reformation, and
is to be again reformed, and carried back
still further towards the primitive form and
meanings. The people have broken loose
from the priestcraft which would fain have
them believe that “caste” is of Divine ordi-
nance, and the misery and penury of the
many for the benefit of the few an ordinance
from the Most High. The religion of those
that labour and are heavy laden can no
longer be one which offers them the conso-
lations of—the rights of oroperty and the
law of demand and supply ! If the Church-
men desire that the working men of the
next generation shall believe in Christ,
they will have to begin themselves to be-
lieve in Him a good deal more implicitly.
Amongst other things, they will have to
begin to believe that when He spoke the
parables of Dives and Lazarus and of the
Camel and the Needle’s eye, and when he
told the man of great possessions to sell
them and communise his property, He
meant what He said. One thing seems as-
sured: that the religion of the mass of man-
kind in the immediate future is going to be
Socialism, and that whether the nations,
and not merely the nobles and the rich, are
to be Christians, will depend entirely upon
the readiness and ability of theologians to
demonstrate that the principles of Chris-
tianity are identical with what is now
known as Socialism.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Pebble from the Brook.
Mb. Thomas Walker, the Freethought Parson,
is certainly a very astute young man. He badly
broke-up his orthodox brethren assembled under
the leadership of the Bishop of Sydney to promote
the' inauguration of a “ Christian Evidence
Society.” Mr. Walker’s method was very adroit.
He cordially concurred with the professed object
of the meeting. This amiable co-operation ob-
viously took the promoters of the meeting all
aback, and puzzled them consumedly. They could
not decently deny a hearing to any one who sup-
ported the object for which the meeting was held.
And they could not challenge Mr. Walker’s sin-
cerity. Had they frankly announced that their
object had been in reality to constitute a society
to rake upland disseminate the evidence favour-
able to Christianity, of course Mr. Walker might
have been ruled out of Court, so to speak. But
the assumption, which was a necessity of their
position, that all evidence bearing upon Chris-
tianity is favourable—or, at worst, that the balance
of evidence is conclusively and crushlngly favour-
able— exposed them to Mr. Walker’s flank move-
ment. The evidence respecting Christianity is, as
he pointed out, a matter of quite as much concern
to Freethinkers as to Regulation-thinkers. While
the Jmeetlng had tacitly .meant that the Society
shotild be one to promulgate only one side of the
evidence affecting Christianity,Mr. Walker spread
dismay and confusion in the ranks by blandly
ignoring the tacit understanding and accepting
the apparent sense of the project. He offered the
co-operation of his fellow-sceptics to go thoroughly
into both sides of the evidence, and to utilise any
resources at the command of the Society to
disseminate the particulars of the investigation.
This obliging offer is so transparently fair, so en-
tirely in harmony with the ostensible object of the
proposed Society, that it is no]wonder the Bishop
in the chair was utterly[confounded and posed by
the dilemma it placed him in. To refuse accept-
ance of Mr. Walker's offer would have been
tantamount to a confession of uncertainty as to
the result of permitting the “evidence” to be
other than one-sided./- To accept the offer would
have been, on the other hand, equivalent to a con-
fession that the truth of Chriatlanity/as ordinarily
propounded, is debateable. No wonder that the
Bishop and his entourage of orthodox champions
stood aghast and staggered when this heterodox
David appeared, sling in hand, to confront
Goliath Barry and such mighty men of
war as occupied the citadel on the platform.
The Bishop’s rejoinder to Mr. Walker's gage, suf-
ficiently indicates the quandary in which he found
himself. “ We thank Mr. Walker for his sugges-
tions,” said the poor Bishop, “whether we will
adopt them or not” (some hisses, cries of “Ob,”
and applause); we shall give them our best con-
sideration, claiming our right to free choice, and
doing whatever we believe to be most advisable to
the bringing out, not of ad captnndum controversy,
but of real truth.” Unless we are greatly mis-
taken, the result will prove that the theologian’s
view of the course best adapted to t licit real
truth, will be to confine the enquiry entirely to
hearing and publishing all that can be elicited
—on one side of the question; and if the
case for the other side be stated at all, to
take care that it be stated by advocates specially
engaged to make nonsense of it.
More Libel Law.
A libel was heard before Mr. Justice Win-
deyeb at Maitland, on October 37th, which has in-
terest for all journalists and many strolling
players. The proprietor of the Maitland Mail
had inserted an advertisement for one Thomas
Ellis, manager of a company of strollers styled
the Royal Bijou Dramatic Company. On personally
applying for payment for the advertisement, the
proprietor was refused a settlement, the debtor
simply alleging that he was short of money and
had to take his company on to New England, and
asking his creditor to wait till he (the manager)
got back to his business in Newcastle, where, it
came out in cross-examination, he is a boot
“ manufacturer.” It also came out that the plain-
tiff is an uncertlflcated insolvent, and has been
twice insolvent; and, in cross-examination, he
admitted that he had left Maitland without
paying a hotel-keeper for the board of
some of his company. Failing to get paid, the
proprietor of the Mail published the following
notice:—“The Royal Bijou Dramatic Company
have.lt appears, 4 bobbed up serenely* at;Tam-
worth. We trust the enterprising manager, Mr.
Tom Ellis will be more fortunate up North than
he was here, and tnat the ;people up above
who do anything for him will be more
lucky in getting paid than those who had
anything to do with him in this town,”
which, perhaps, saved hotel-keepers and news-
paper-proprietors in other towns the unpleasant
lot of becoming ci editors of Ellis without covet-
ing that advantageous position. The paragraph
quoted was the alleged libel, and £500 was the sum
asked for as damages. Mr. Edmunds, for defeu-
dant, argued that this was a case in which it was the
duty of the press to protect the public by uttering
a warning against unprincipled men. But Judge
Windeyer ruled that “the paragraph was un-
doubtedly libellous, and one for which there was
no excuse. A newspaper-proprietor stood in the
same position as any other private individual.
All people had a right to comment on any matter
of public Interest or notoriety, or criticise a public
man’s actions. But the paragraph was not a matter
of public interest so far as the evidence went to
show. It appeared that defendant only twas not
paid, and this was not a matter of public Interest.
If it could be shown that plaintiff went about
swindling the pul lie, then that would be a differ-
ent matter. Under the circumstances, it appeared
to him that there must be a verdict for plaintiff.”
The jury accordingly returned a verdict for the
plaintiff for £50, which carried all costs. In future,
therefore, country journalists will have to observe
that, if they desire to warn their brethren and the
trades-people and hotel-keepers of other places
that non-paying strollers are on the war-path,
they will haul to do so by private letters marked
44 private and confidential,” and then still at the
risk of having to contribute £500 to the im-
provement of their debtor’s circumstances, if
he can have them before Judge Windeyer. On
the other hand, the result of the case should be a
great encouragement to any uncertiflcated insol-
vent in the boot- 44 manufacturing ” line, and to
others similarly circumstanced, who may have a
taste for theatrical speculation, and prefer to pay
their way only when convenient to themselves, or
possibly only if their spec, turn out well, and to
make people who are foolish enough to give them
a meal or an advertisement without having cash
in advance bear the loss, if the dramatle specula-
tion prove unprofitable. To prevent any miscon-
ception which might expof e us to the ruling of Mr.
Justice Windeyer orothcr Judge learned in jus-
no, learned in the law is the usual phrase, we
have to state distinctly that we do not allege that
Ellis was actuated by the motives above indi-
cated. We hold, with Mr. Justice Windeyer, that
he is a most estimable person, who has been unfor-
tunate in his business transactions, although pos-
sibly not so unfortunate as those who had business
transactions with him prior to any of his insol-
vencies.IHMr. Ellis, we hold to be a most esti-
mable man—unlucky, perhaps, at times, but fortu-
nate in the esteem of Mr. Justice Windeyer. The
proprietor of the Maitland Mail, on the other
hand, may possibly have been fortunate enough in
business to pay every man his due throughout his
career. But he has an intemperate animosity
against persons who run into debt without reflect-
ing how their liabilities are to bo discharged, and
has a wicked tendency to cry “stop thief," to the
great injury of persons who ask nothing better
than to be allowed .to pursue their business in
peace and quietness.

A Caustic Critic.
We have just come across the following paragraph.
It was at the bottom of an old file of similar things
which we mislaid while moving to our new marine
residence. We recovered the file this morning. It
was in the crown of a tall hat of an antique pat-
tern, in which we were accustomed to carry our
luggage when leaving our lodgings in the old
Bohemian days. Just read the paragraph, and
then say if we have not got our troubles as well as
the rest of the worl d. Here:—
“Last week’s issue of the Sydney Bulletin con-
tains a would-be-funny paragraph on our pre-
sumption in attempting to analyse and criticise
Henry George’s Communistic work, ‘Progress
and Poverty.’ The Bulletin asserts. In language
strongly flavoured with the ‘essence of sneer,’
that all that could possibly be written on George s
book has been written, and that it isimpossibletor
a country editor to throw any further light upon
the subject, or advance any new arguments to con-
trovert George's plausible though sophistical
theories. Our articles on the work are written
with a view to, if possible, counteract its mis-
chievous tendencies by exposing the fact that the
strength and plausibility ot his arguments emanate
from a false base.”
And this is a paper that we have especially recom-
mended to serious-minded trunk-makers and reli-
gious hosiers! Where was ever ingratitude like to
this?' The editor will not even admit that our
paragraph about him was funny. Perhaps it
wasn’t—the subject was a poor one. But let us
inform that bush philosopher that it is impossible
for a country editor to controvert the statements
of Henry George, for the reason that the man
who could do this would find some higher mission
in life than to grovel to squatters, and lick the
shoes (it is an old phrase, but so is the custom) of a
shoddy aristocracy for the sake of their miserable
patronage and wretched applause. If he would
not, then we have trodden on better dirt than
such a man. But, of course, there is no such. We
are quite sure that the editor of the Wentworth
Advocate— although Wentworth is in the centre
of a squatting district—would never descend to
such degradation. Therefore, his articles on Henry
George are to be taken as novel though
tedious jokes. It is a peculiarity of ancient men
to make “to-be-continued” jokes of uncommon
humour—only that, unfortunately, they either
forget the point or die before they come to
it. As to the paragraph which we have quoted,
it is hardly necessary to say that it is a
corollary to the articles, and written in the same
spirit of decrepit drollery. We need only point to
the concluding sentence about the articles being
written to counteract the mischievous tendencies
of George’s work, and mention that Wentworth
is a city with a population about equal to that of
Five Dock, to establish this fact. The paragraph
winds up with this spiteful little sentence:—
“The Bulletin never e'akes puns; it only im-
ports them in wholesale quantities, adulterates,
and localises the original article to suit the times.”
Just imagine the state of an intellect which can
conceive of a pun being imported, adulterated,
and localised ! The old story, we suppose—too
much beer! Who could be angry with a man who
could write like that ? Not we. Therefore we—
figuratively, of course —pat the editor on his
reverend head with a bologna, and forgive him.
Buchanan and Malthusianism.
In view of Mr. Buchanan’s attempt, since backed
up by journals which should know better, to put
the Malthusian saddle on the wrong horse, the fol"
lowing extracts from an article published by us
on June 4 th of this year have peculiarly apt re-
levance :—
“Does population inevitably outgrow the means
of subsistence unless artificially checked, or does
it not? Malthus maintains the affirmative;
George argues for the negative. It is quite im-
possible for us, with the space at our command, to
give even a synopsis of the arguments on either
side. Readers must master these for themselves.
All we Intend just now to state is a series of con-
sequences supplied — first by Malthus, and
secondly by George, according to the system of
each, if Malthus be correct, then clouds veil the
face of Heaven. A merciless Creator looks
down in sublime indifference upon an unhappy
race of His creatures, of whom the greater num-
ber are doomed to toil and suffering, and
a multitude to misery of such bitterness as can
scarcely be conceived—the misery of wretches
perpetually quivering on the verge of destruction
by famine, violence, or diseases produced by, or
rendered fatal by, want. It Malthus be correct,
irregularities of condition are ordained by Heaven,
and all would famish together were equality in-
sisted upon. According to Malthus, there are
but three checks to population, viz., moral re-
straint, vice,; and misery. Mr. Malthus was a
clergyman of the Church of England, and his pro-
posed remedy was, of course, moral restraint. The
form recommended, and advocated with satisfac-
tion by the school which he founded among the
comfortable classes, was that, in proportion
as a man was poor, he should abstain from
niarriag;e, or at least from procreation. In
brief, his proposition was that when fortune had
denied to a man the enjoyment of affluence, rank,
consideration, and ease, and had instead heaped
upon him care, want, penury, insult, and toll, he
should crown his miseries by denying himself the
Pleasures of wedlock and the joys of paternity,
railing that, he was taught that Providence had
other terrors as Inevitable alternatives. The cata-
logue is a grievous one. Redundant humanity
was to be kept down by “ unwholesome occupa-
tions, severe labour, and exposure to the seasons,
extreme poverty, bad nursing of children, great
towns, excesses of all kinds, the whole train
of epidemics and diseases, wars, plagues, famines,
Promiscuous intercourse, unnatural passions,
adultery, and (improper arts to conceal the
consequences of irregular connections.” It is
worthy of notice here that Malthus has the
ardent support of the majority of the clergy, of
Mr. Bradlauqh, and of Mrs. Besant. The doc-
trine that it is the duty of the poor to abstain
from wedlock and parentage is one much insisted
upon by clerical visitors of the slums and cottages
ct England, and has, of course, done much to en-
dear religion to the distressed classes. Mr. Brad-
hAUGH and Mrs. Besant, however, imagined that
modern physiological discoveries had supplied a
remedy more just and equal than a moral restraint;
to be exercised only by those whose entire life
was one long penance; and, so believing, un-
dertook, in what they believed were the
mterests of humanity, to disseminate those
Physiological facts, which, according to the
view of Malthus, would, if acted upon, avert
«om mankind all the catalogue of horrors we
"*ye quoted above. There was true heroism in
the attempt, no doubt. It involved a frightful
“elf-sacrifice—to the woman, at least. Both had to
mee the ordeal of a criminal prosecution, and to
sustain life-long obloquy as disseminators of what
was stigmatised as foul and immoral literature,
posterity will, perhaps, do justice in this matter,
to expect it of contemporary opinion would he
*mn. Such are the fruits of the doctrine of Mal-
jffius. A world perpetually scourged. For the
Poor, no hope. For the wealthy, no reason for ex-
ercising charity, or pretending a pity which the
almighty himself had not deigned to show. On
Jha other hand, Henry George stands forth with
“G denial that population does increase, under the
most favourable circumstances, faster than the
means of subsistence. Let his view b correct,
nd straightway the heavens open; a Benignant
God smiles upon all His creatures; Hope blesses
the earth; Charity becomes a duty; Self-denial is
a virtue once more; the catalogue of horrors fades
out of the Book of Fate: the brooding spectra.
Misery, which Malthus had raised as a perpetual
terror to mankind, skurries gibbering into oblivion,
like a ghost at the first celestial refulgence of a
dawning day. All creation, till then dumb with
the chill horror of the Malthusian gospel, breaks
into hjmns of joy and adoration, as the pitiless
Deity depicted by Malthus vanishes, and the
Just and Loving God portrayed by George Is
disclosed in all His majesty.”
An Abortive Attack.
Mr. David Buchanan once declared in his place
in Parliament that a man has a right to get drunk
if ho likes, and we believe that the hon. gentleman
has honestly acted up to his principles in that
particular. The other day he declared that the
Government was deeply blameworthy in not sup.
pressing the meetings and preachments of the
heretics known as Freethinkers and Secularists.
Combining these expressions of opinion, we arrive
at the singular fact that Mr. Buchanan maintains
that a man has a right to drown his reason in rum,
but not to exercise it in a sense repugnant to
established theories. Mr. Buchanan specially
enforced his contention that the Sunday lectures
should be put a stop to, by referring to the recent
shocking cases of procuration of abortion, and to
the fact that one of the parties ac cused had quoted
the principles of Malthus as justification for his
acts, and had announced himself to be a Secular-
ist. Mr. inference is that Malthu-
sianism is peculiar to Secularists, and procuration
of abortion a resource counselled by either system
or by both. The whole presumption is nonsensical
and baseless. In the first place, Mr. Malthus was
to the close of his life a respected benefleed clergy-
man of the Church of England. Secondly, his
principles have teen universally endorsed by
Christian writers, and happen to be about
the only theories which Christian authorities
and Secularist writers agree in accepting.
The Archbishop of Canterbury and Mr. Brad-
laugh are equally Malthusians, and the mainten
anee of the entire structure of society is chiefly
defended byf arguments which take,|the proposi-
tions of Malthus as their base. The only differ-
ence between the two sets of Malthusian dis-
ciples islthat both hold with Mr. Malthus that
while the begetting of children should be re-
strained, the well-to-do and orthodox maintain
that the desired end should be accomplished by in.
ducing or compelling the lower orders to abstain
from marriage, or at least from sexual commerce
with their wives; while the plebeian and hetero-
dox'assert that such a proposal is a monstrous ini-
quity, would deprive the poor of about the only
joys they share equally with the rich, and suggest
Instead simple and entirely harmless methods by
which sexual commerce can be rendered fruitless.
Mr. Buchanan altogether blunders. It is not Mal-
thusianism which is heterodox, disreputable, and
dangerous in dhe eyes of Conservative opinion
Malthusianism is the orthodox and proper thing
to believe in. It is anti-Malthusianism which is to
be censured and denounced by “ ail right-thinking
people.” The Bulletin has repeatedly denounced
the Malthusian doctrine as prokably false, and
certainly a cruel, gloomy, and detestable theory,
disposing men to doubt the existence of a just and
loving God. But the Duke of Argyle and the
classes which hold views in common with such
staid orthodox men as he, stand by Malthusianism
stoutly. In a paper in the Nineteenth Century
of April last, the Duke fiercely sneers at Henry
George for his repudiation of Malthusianism, and
says ;—
“The man (Henry George) who gives this dark
— this almost black—pic tiro of the tendencies of
American progress, is the same man who rejects
with indignation the doctrine that population does
everywhere tend to press in the same way upon
the limits of subsistence. This, as ii well known,
is the general proposition which is historically
connected with the name of Malthus, although
other writers before him had unconsciously felt
and assumed its truth. Since his time It has been
almost universally admitted not as a theory, but
as a fact, and one of the most clearly ascertained
of all the facts of economic science. But, like all
Communists, Mr. George hates the very name of
Malthus.”
The “Temporary” Imposture.
The case of the Temporary Draftsmen in the Sur-
vey Depirtment has been various’y discussed-
first, by Mr. Farnell, in replying to the deputa-
tion from these employes, and subsequently by
several of the dally papers. But neither Mr.
Farnell nor any of the writers in the press have
the knowledge of the grievance which actual ex-
perience gives. We have, although our experience
is seventeen years old. This gives some idea of
the permanence of the order of “ temporary ’
draftsmen. As might have been expected, no
e’ear remedy is proposed either by Mr. Farnell
or by uninformed writers. Now, here are the
laots. The work of drafting is in some offices done
almost entirely by temporary employes. In our
own experience, in one small department there
were four temporary to every one permanent
draftsman. A margin of fluctuation in drafting
work there will constantly be, and economy re-
quires that there be a corresponding proportion of
men engaged only when there is a press of work.
Rut there is no proportion observed. Heads of
Departments .like to have a body of men under
them wh i are abs dutely t on their nod.
The regular members of the Civil Service are com-
paratively independent. They have their charter,
so to speak, in the Civil Service Act, and can
neither be bullied with impunity nor turned
adrift at will. The temporary employes are sub-
ject to both incidents, and, besides, have the mor-
tification of seeing boys whom they have prac-
tically taught their business promoted over thoir
heads. There ii only one true remedy for this
absurd state of affairs, and ti at is to confer per-
manent appointments on temporary employes as
soon as there is evidence that the growth of steady
work has reached a stage which makes It sure that
there will be no need to reduce the staff. And let
them then be rated according to the place their
efficiency has won for them in the office,
without regard to canons of seniority which would
make them junior in rank and In salary
to lads who had entered the office subsequently to
themstlves. The simple plan would be to make
their appointment to the Civil Service date as re-
gards seniority to the day they practically entered
it. There would be minor difficulties in the case
of men who had been employed on several occa-
sions at intervals, but administrative Ingenuity
should be equal to framing a scale of averages to
meet these cases. If Mr. Parnell really sees bis
way to reduce, ere long, the number of drafts-
men, he should try to do justice to old “tempo,
rary ” servants by dispensing preferably with new
“permanent ’’ ones. But we have lit tie faith, after
twenty years’ experience and observation—seven
of waioh were spent in the Civil Service in the
Australian colonies—in the reality of reductions.
Our belief is that, without imposing one shilling
of extra or unnecessary burdens upon the tax-
payers, two-thirds, if not four-fifths, of the tem-
porary draftsmen now employed might be ga-
zetted members of the regular Civil Service.
Mr. Henry Wise, Managing Trustee of
the N. S. Wales Savings’ Bank.
Mr. Henry Wise, whose portrait appears on
our front page, has been appointed to the posi-
tion of managing trustee of the N. 8. Wales Sav-
ings’ Bank—to the position rendered vacant by the
death of Mr. W. H. Cutt. Mr. Wise was unani-
mously elected by the trustees, and his election
subsequently confirmed by the Executive Council.
The post is a very important and responsible one,
requiring ability, courtesy, and an unblemished
reputation in the official occupying it. For nearly
thirty years Mr. Wise has been connected with the
institution over which he now presides. During
that long period both his confreres who have
elected him and the public whom he has served
have had ample opportunities of gauging his fit-
ness for the appointment. The fact of his having
been chosen unanimously by the one, ami the
choice endorsed by the other, is a fair index of the
esteem in which he is held. Nor is it as a Govern-
ment official only that he is well and widely
known. As an amateur artist of merit and a con-
noisseur of judgment, he has done much to de-
velop a taste for art in Australia. Many a strug-
gling tyro is indebted to him for advice, sympathy,
and ready assistance.

Max O’Rell, in his “ Daughters of John

in England is emphasized by an anecdote of Lord
Derby, who, in proposing the toast of The
Ladies” at a city banquet, once said, “ Before
naming an Englishman to an important post, the
first question which invariably occurs to the
electors is this, ‘What sort of a wife has he?
Whereupon the lively Frenchman neatly philoso-
phises, “How many men of meric could I name
who will owe to their wives the honour of remain-
ing all their lives obscure heroes ?”
It appears from the Malmesbury autobio-

he mnst keep up his popularity, and then God
knows what he may do.” How happy we ought to
be in this Southern land! When our great states-
men—John Davies and Angus Cameron, and so on
—want to keep up their popularity they don’t
proclaim war : they simply attend a Friendly
Society’s picnic down the harbour.
The chief magistrate of one of the Irish
towns visited by the Duke of Cambridge must be
a humourist as well as a Nationalist. He presented

which picture represented Lord Spenser playing

key, begging for pence. The Duke was polite
enough to smile, and the reporter who described
the incident spoke of him as appearing “immensely
amused.” A more Irish way of making a guest
fed at his ease during a tour could hardly be in-
vented, even by one of Lever’s heroes.
Despite all the “marmalade,” some of it
rather bitter, lavished by Max O’Rell, upon
Englishwomen, in his new work, “Lea Filles de

means believes in their possession of heroic
qualities, for he says distinctly, “ England made all
her great conquests in the time when women
were treated with as little regard as they have for
them.ln the harems of the East; and it is to this in-
difference for women—to this independence of the
man—that one can in part attribute the success of
the English.

This distribution of blankets and prohibition of

General Gordon will not return to England

finally in some hut amid the squalor and misery of

himself to the work of teaching and Christianising
and ameliorating the temporal condition of the

them since London was a city, may yet come to
regard the iron-willed General as a Divine being
rather than as a mere man.

his lavishness, and his poetry. We didn’t look long
enough, or perhaps we might have stumbled
across one of Garden Honey. By the way, Alfred’s
bust is labelled Brutus or Daphne, or something;
anyhow it’s Alfred. And talking (we are full ot
anecdote), of the Art Gallery, here is something
that occured there, the other day :—An Iroquois
sailor said to one of the attendants—“Say, whar
d'ye spit, boss, in this yer pictur mill ? ” “ In your
handkerchief,” was the grave rejoinder.
The Prince of Wales got lately from a fa-
shionable London tobacconist a sample of cigars.
He called in at the trader’s a few days afterwards,
and, having in his frank fashion praised the quality
of one weed, offered to buy up the lot. All right;
honoured, delighted! only M. Baumgarteo
thought it proper to state that the cigars were 5s.
each, or £320 for the consignment. Whereupon
H.R.H. expressed himself thus: "Mr. B., your
cigars are the very finest I have ever smoked, but
I am too poor a man to pay such a price for them.”
And with this pronouncement the heir to the
throne left the space between the commercial
counters for the glittering realms of royalty. Sub-
sequently, however, the Duke of Sutherland, him-
self an epicure In cigars, sampled the same lot, and
sent them as a present to H.K.H.
When the gentleman who is now Admiral
Courbet was a young officer, he once went ashore
with half a dozen men in cannibal-land, and seeing
some eggs about, proceeded to mix up the ingre-
dients for an omelette. But, what to flavour it
with? Lieutenant Courbet, however, saw hanging
round some festoons of morel, a condiment of the
fungus family, better known in German than in
English cookery, and hacked off with his sword a
goodly piece, which the blue*jackets mixed with
the omelette. But the women of the tribe pointed
to the morels and howled, and the men began to
get mad. Ultimately it transpired that the sup-
posed festoons of morel were. In reality, dried
human brains, taken from the skulsl of conquered
enemies — emblems sacred as household gods.
Admiral Courbet, all the same, delights in relating
bis culinary adventure, and to this day declares
that he never ate such a savoury omelette 1
Ismail Pasha, being interviewed by a Pall
Mall reporter about his chance of “ biffing ” that
splendid sovereign, Tewflk, out of Egypt, said:
“ They say the Egyptian soldiers won’t fight—yet
with them alone I conquered the Soudan. They
are staunch; but the Kurds are not. It’s the
whey of those Kurds to flee.” “It’s the ”
murmured the reporter timidly. “ Your pardon,”
said Ismail; “ I omitted to tell you that the miser-
able sixty thousand a year granted me by an un-
grateful son not sufficing for my minus plaisirs, I
have supplemented my Income by writing for the
comic papers.” “ Then 1 think, ’ stammered the
interviewer, making for the door, “ that 1 11 ”
“ Oh, if you must go—but, stay; ’ere you depart,”
cried the Unthroned One, “weigh well what
have said about those Kurds.” Then the reporter
departed precipitately, and Ismail sat himself
down at his little desk to build up " wholesome
fun ” at tea shillings a column.
Mr. Richard Jefferies, when discoursing on
English pastoral subjects, is not surpasred in
simple eloquence and graphic power by any living
writer. But he has now issued a novel, “In the
Dewy Morn,” and seems to have gone, la the lan-
guage of the South Seas, “ dean off his kadoova.
The novelist dwells on the indications of hie hero-
ine’s bodily charms with a fervour that amounts
to rhapsody. The beauty of a perft ct skin, we are
told, is so great to gaze at, it is happiness; and “ to
express beauty, you must delineate the adipose
tissue,” but the knee is the exception, for the
knees are the centres from which ail beauty rises.
“ Human life is centred in the knee—It is so very
human, so nearly sorrowful in its humanity. Beau-
tiful knees, the poise and centre of the form!
Were I rich, how gladly I would give a thousand
pounds for a true picture of the kneel” The old
gentleman has evidently had a long course of opera
bouffe and the ballet. The heroine does all the
courting in his book. We hope she didn’t scrim
many floors. She might have had corns on her
knees.
The next Mayor of Newtown is to be
Alderman Boots, a rival of Ninny's in the under-

bury their dead in harmony together, and, iH baa

subject of coffin-plates. The attitude of the
Council is not so harmonious, however; for, toe
other day, on the subject of Alderman B.’s eler-

considerable confusion, and a number of members

that Boots lacked polish; but, in reply, he sarcas-
tically congratulated himself upon never bems

This is not a cannibalistic story, After a
shipwreck, a Jew and a Christian were clinging
for dear life to a spar inrald-ocean. Their strength
was all but spent; the Jew was almost done for,
his hair and beard were trailing In the water, ana
his numbed fingers could scarcely maintain their
hold of the wood. The Christian suddenly espied
a ship, and exclaimed, “A sail! a sail!" The half
insensible Jew roused himself at the word, and
moaned, ‘A shale, did you say, ma tear? a shale!
oh, it’s just my blooming luck! and I haven’t got

Cheery chat for a customer, this -was. Dr

of his travels, bought a real Jive horse, sired, we
believe, by “Sir Roger,” and darn’d by everyone
who had previously tried to ride him. And, as
the medicine man led his now purchase home, he
casually observed to his groom, “ Ike, d’ye think
that chesnut’s likely to throw a ‘ splint ’ ?” “No, f
don’t,” replied Ike; “ but I think he’s mighty apt
to throw a doctor.”

During Lis recent journey to Scotland, the

Mr. George Augustus Sala is a Jew—at
least, so all his London literary brethren aver.
Perhaps they make the statement with a view to
accounting for his cleverness. There is in the
London D.T. office a gentleman named George
Anderson—his patronymic, on dit, was originally
Aarons—many brilliant leaders from whose pen are
attributed to Mr. Sala, whose literary stylo Mr.
Anderson has acquired to perfection. The latter
gentleman, who probably owes much of the pic-
turesqueness and force, which pervade his “ copy,”
to the Semitic current running in his blood, is a
strong link in the vertebras of the D.T., and is
known to many Australian readers as the author
of that lovely and most readable book “ Scenes in
the Commons,” reviews of which appeared in the
colonial press not so very long ago. Mr. Anderson,
who is close upon fifty, but only looks two and
thirty, was originally a wood-engraver, which pro-
fession he forsook some twenty years since for
journalism. The pen fits his fingers even better
than did the graver. He is a clever speaker, and
may yet visit the colonies as a lecturer. And—tell
it not in Gath 1—Edmund Yates of the World Is
also a Jew. This year he will probably spend
Christmas in gaol, for libelling Lord Lonsdale. Per-
haps it’s just as well. If he were free, he would
probably not celebrate the great Christian anni-
versary in a manner according with the views of
the Evangelicals.
One of the blue-blooded squatocracy of
the Western district (Vic.), who gave his name ns
George Robinson at the City Police Court (Mel-
bourne), lately, was haring a playful time of it in
the Southern Babylon, and would have got into a
good deal of trouble had he not been “highly
connected.” This gay young blood, having
tired of the revelries of Bourke and Swans-
ton streets, went 'urther a-fleld for new ad-
ventures, and pulled up at the house of
a commercial traveller in the Victoria Parade. In
response to his knock, the lady of the house
opened the door, when the visitor tried to force
himself in, and, failing that, he tried the efficacy
of the golden key, but was equally unsuccessful.
Eventually a policeman appeared on the scene,
who, “ with the greatest of dilfewkulty, sur-
rounded him,” and, after considerable loss of
gore and uniform, he handed the highly connected
party over to the tender care of Monsieur Delaney
at the City lock-up. Next morning the young
squattah faced the music at the City Police
Court, a-d, though th - charge was sheeted home
by the lady whom he had so grossly insulted, and
whose evidence was corroborated by that of the
intelligent constable, yet this playful young blood
was let off with the light fine of £3. “ Begorra,
afther all, tisn’t so bad at ail to have a friend at
coort,” murmured the arresting policeman, as he
surveyed his tattered uniform, an( fixed the
sticking-plaster on his cheek; “an’, maybe, the
nexttoime I’m axed to lumber one ov his propin
sitlee, ’tis a wide berth I’ll be afther givin’ him.”
At one of the principal cricket matches at
Lord’s during the past season, a lot of people sit-
ting round the ring were much annoyed by an
over-dressed, wizened young man, who seemed to
be a barber’s clerk out for a holiday, and bad con-
stituted himself jester to the company. Some of
his remarks were rather smart, and, egged on by
the laughter of the crowd, he lost no opportunity
of chaffing, in a more or less offensive way, almost
everyone who walked past his bench. During the
rolling of the wickets, he addressed his polite at-
tentions to an Australian who sensibly wore a
white hat. while thousands of the multitude swel-
tered in the sun’s glare arrayed in bell-toppers and
black frock coats. “Has to wear white to keep
nis brain cool,” remarked the clever young man.
The Australian addressed turned sharply round,
looked at the speaker for a moment, and then said
pleasantly, “ Ab, Lefroy 1 it’s you, is it ? I thought
you had been hanged!” All eyes were turned on
the jester, who certainly bore a marvellous like-
ness to the hanged gentleman—which resemblance
the crowd, most of whom had evidently seen the
portrait of the convict in the illustrated papers,
Instantaneously noted. The cheeky, ferret-eyed
young man tried to say something, but bis face
grew white with rage and his tongue seemed glued
to the roof of his mouth. At last he stammered
out, pointing to the Australian team, who were
now taking the field: “ I suppose you’re the Judas
from among the twelve.” “No,” sweetly re-
sponded our cornstalk friend, “I am the juryman
who for one minute held out for you against the
other eleven. Go back to your grave, Lefroy.”
There was a hum among the crowd and the jester
spake no more.
If report speaks truly, a rcene from “Mea-
sure for Measure” (but with a more disastrous
termination) has just been enacted in Melbourne;
thepart of the lustful Angelo being taken to the
me by a certain detective (a married man, too), his
victim being a barmaid of considerable personal
attractions. To this Isabella, it seems, Angelo of
the ‘ foorce ” has long made improper overtures,
out she, being a virtuous girl, even though in the
ranks of the much maligned, repulsed the scoun-
drel always. Mark how Angelo manoeuvred. He
knew his victim had a wild, harum-scarum
brother, much after the style of Claudio in the
Play, and he therefore kept his “heaglo heye” on
the young fellow until he tripped. Immediately
ae had done eo, the detective swooped down like a
\ uiture on his prey, and, getting the warrant for
maudio s arrest, he went off with it at once to the
sister, to whom he proposed that she should yield
mm her honour as the price of her brother’s
escape. There was no hope of the brother getting
away, for the detective, who had shadowed him
xor weeks before the warrant was issued, could
“m his hand upon him at any moment. To save
!.®r brother, the wretched girl at last consented,
h?o’ Grange to say, the detective actually kept
word and permitted the accused to escape,
mus achieving the singular Infamy of being at
55®® false to his wife, to his Queen, and to every
of humanity. We have heard of some
f deeds done by the Victorian D.’s, but,

8tiff walk that rheumatism or the
derf U of ypars gives. The outlines of the shoul-
*• however, retain some of their former ele- |
gance. Jf the world has not gone from her, she
has lost all taste for it. Seclusion sometimes
weighs upon her. At Carlsbad she refused all ex-
ceptional honours and favours, lived quietly at
au hotel, and took her place in a queue at the
pump. Her old vivacity has died out. She has
the generosity to ascribe to her impetuous dispo-
sltiou the culminating error of the Emperor’s
reign, and another event for which she will mourn
as long as life and consciousness remain to her.
The Empress still thinks aloud, and talks often and
rapidly of what is on her mind. She ill bears any
mental tension, unless in religious exercises, and
has not the resources of music, embroidery, knit-
ting, or sewing, which enabled Marie Amdlie to
beguile the tedium of a residence at Claremont.
Her infirmity prevents her walking much. She
lives at Farnborough in the past and among
objects reminding her of departed glories of the
Emperor and of her ill-starred son, of whom she
can now speak without falling into paroxysms of
grief. She has been compared to Henrietta
Maria, widow of our own Charles I., who also
had reason to deplore the impetuosity of
h;r disposition. That Queen, however, had a trial
in her old age to which the Empress has not been
subjected. She lived in Prance when she was a
discrowned Queen and widow in dire poverty.
Her house at Bois Colombes was in the marshy
part of a wind-swept plain, and, being too poor to
buy firewood, she had to stay in bed in winter to
keep herself warm.
Amande Lucille Aurore Dudevant (nie
Dupin) was a veritable Frenchwoman-the female
Rousseau of her day and generation—the immense
vibrations of whose sweetly-passionately human
voice filled Europe with the name of Geon ge Sand,
the non de plume over which she wrote works that
were social revelations: a name at which the prud-
ish British matron shuddered, and the pulpit-
thumping evangelical Honeythunder roared at in
supreme unblushing ignorance of the holy teach-
ings contained therein. The “mad, lewd, bra-en
virago,” the “ Muse of Adultery ’’—such were the
choice terms which Messieurs the Chadbands and
Mesdames the Grundys applied to the bright,
delicate, keen intellect, whose only anathemas
were for the “average sensual ” man and conven-
tional tight-laced, narrow-brained woman: whose
every aspiration was towards a purged society
whose every literary effort was in search of a free
conception of a more beautiful human life; and
whrse religion was not idle talk about God and the
unknowable, not setting of Him forth dogmati-
cally, but a purification of existence and a revivi-
fication of affection by suffering unselfishly en-
dured and duty bravely done. Aurore—the George
Sand to be—was born in 1804; her father, whose
Illegitimate daughter she nearly had been, her
mother, Aurore nte von Sachsen (daughter of
Moritz Graf von Sachsen, the illegitimate warrior
son of that too, too paternal monarch of Paxony,
Augustus II. bv Aurore von Konigsmark) having
only married Mons. Dupin a lew days before
her birth, was a well-to-do Parisian bookseller,
P f i . B '® UG8eau - Voitair ean views. He did the world
infinite service by begetting Aurore, to whom, at
his deith, he left a snug little property at Nohaut,
in ilerry, the streams, and woods, and sloping
downs about which his daughter’s poetical genius
has given a music for evermore. Three years of
hfe In a convent quite satisfied Aurore that she
wouldn t be a nun. She claimed and obtained her
freedom, and then went in for independence,
which, however, she sacrificed again, when at 18
she consented to marry Baron Dudevant. Dude-
vant, in his own stupid person, taught his brilliant
young wife to hate the “average sensual man”
with her whole heart and soul. She left him in
fSSl. having bought from him for £2000 her two
children by him, Moritz and Solange. When they
separated, she went into man’s dress, and taking
with her her little daughter and the MSS. of
Indiana, went to Paris. It was the year after the
Revolution that had expelled Charles Dix from
the throne. Full of ardent hope, she joined the
party and propaganda of organic change, but only
to see a plutocratic bourgeosie, headed by the Fox
of Orleans, step into the place vacated by Hi vine
KightI No wonder she was bitter for a while, and
that her days were the “ days of revolt.’’ In Pans
she linked herself to Jules Sande au (hence the
Sand ”) and together they wrote “ La Prima
Donna ’ and “Rose et Blanche.” Then thair pub-
lisher asked for something all her own. bhe
banded him “Indiana.” In the year 1833 she
cut Sandeau, and became lie with Alfred de
Musset, with whom she “did” Italy, lingering
awhile in Venice, where were brought forth
several works, splendid with local colouring, pas-
sionate with cries for an ItaliaRedenta, and sad with
unspeakable anguish begotten of the contempla-
tion of oppression. In “ File et Lui ” she has told
the story of her connection with De Musset, paint-
ing him as a wondrous mass of contradictlons-as
a cynical enthusiast, as a melancholy Bacchanal,
mS a heartless hlasi child. On returning to France,
she “ kept company ” awhile with Pierre Leroux,
and under his impression produced “ fcpiridion.”
Next came her passion for Chopin, and then the
“days of revolt” calmed down, and she settled
herself at Nohaut to preaeh, m her hundred works,
a social gospel to these two texts: “To execrate
the People is the real blasphemy,” and “ The senti-
ment of the ideal life is none other than man’s
normal life as we shall one day know it.” Her
‘ Dernieree Pages ” were published in ’77, the year
I after her death. Poet, dramatist, novelist, she in-
spired Europe with beautiful thoughts; reformer
and philosopher, she scattered broadcast the most
germinal ideas. Not without faults, she clung to
Truth, fought to the last gasp for Freedom and
Equality; and was, withal, as cordial, simple,
benevolent a being as ever walked this earth.
Prudery may throw her spiteful pebbles, and Cant
his blatant maranatha at George Sand, but she is
beyond the reach of either.
Mrs. Besant’s recollections of her earlier
struggling to support her mother and
child by her own exertions, contain touches of
pathos that must go home to the heart ot even the
fiercest bigot. The description of what was con-
sidered her parent's death-bed, the desire of the
mc ’ther to take the Sacrament with her daughter,
and the resolve of the latter to participate in a
ceremony which she considered as useless and
hypocritical, solely to gratify what was thought to
Re her last wishes, cannot but Interest the reader
in the life of the writer. Two clergymen refused
to administer, but at length Mrs. Besant appealed
to one of the noblest and largest-hearted men that
ever wore surplice and stole-the late Bean of
Westminster. The result is thus toldI went to
a clergyman I knew well, and laid the case before
him; as t expei ted, he refused to allow me to com-
municate. I tried a second; the result was the
same. I was In despair. To me the service was
foolish and superstitious, but I would have done a
great deal more for my mother than eat bread and
drink wine, provided that the eating and drinking
did not, by pretence of faith on my part, soil ray
honesty. At last a thought struck me—there was
Dean Stanley, my mother’s favourite, a man
known to be of the broadest school within the
Church of England; suppose I asked him? I did
not know him, though as a young child I had
known his sister as my mother’s friend, and I
felt the request would be something of an im-
pertinence. Yet there was just the chance that he
might consent, and then my darling’s death-bed
would be the easier. I told no one, but set out
resolutely for the deanery, Westminster, timidly
asked for the dean, and followed the servant up-
stairs with a very sinking heart. I was left for a
moment alone in the library, and then the dean
came in. I don’t think I ever in my life felt more
intense) y uncomfortable than I did in that minute’s
interval as he stood waiting for me to speak, his
clear, grave, piercing eyes, gazing right into mine.
Very falteringly I preferred my request, stating
boldly that I was not a believer in Christ; that my
mother was dying; that she was fretting to take
the Sacrament; that she would not take it unless
I took it with her; that two clergymen bad refused
to allow me to take part In the service; that I had
come to him In despair, feeling bow great was the
intrusion—but she was dying. * You were quite
right to come to me,’ hi said, as I concluded, in
that soft musical voice of his, his keen gaze having
changed into oue no less direct, but marvellously
gentle. * Of course I will go and see your mother,
and I have little doubt that if you will not mind
talking over your position with me, we may see
our way clear to doing as your mother wishes.’ I
could barely speak my thanks, so much did the
kindly sympathy move me; the revulsion from
the anxiety and fear of rebutf was strong enough
to be almost pain. But Dean Stanley did more
than I asked him. He suggested that he should
cali that afternoon, and have a quiet chat with my
mother, and then come again the following
day to administer the Sacrament. ‘A stranger's
presence is always trying to a sick person,’
he said, with rare delicacy of thought; ‘and
joined to the excitement of the service, it
might be too much for your dear mother. If
I spend half an hour with her to-day, and adminis-
ter the Sacrament to-morrow, it will, I think, be
better for her.’ So Dean Stanley came that after-
noon, and remained talking with my mother for
about half an hour, and then set himself to under-
stand my own position. He finally told me that
conduct was far more important than theory, and
that he regarded all as * Christians ’ who recognised
and tried to follow the moral law. On the ques-
tion of the absolute Deity of Christ he laid but
little stress. Jesus was, * in a special sense,’ the
‘ Son of God,’ but it was folly to jangle about
words with only human meanings when dealing
with the mysteries of divine existence; and, above
all, it was lolly to make such words into dividing
lines between earnest souls. Tbe one impoitant
matter was the recognition of ‘duty to God and
man,’ and all who were one in that recognition
might rightfully join in an act of worship, the es-
sence of which was not acceptance of dogma, but
love of God and self-sacrifice for man. ‘ The Holy
Communion,’ h© said in his soft tones, ‘ was never
meant to divide from each other hearts that are
searching after the one true God; it was meant by
its founder as a symbol of unity, not of strife.’
On tbe following day he came again, and cele-
brated the ‘Holy Communion’ by the bedside of
my dear mother. Well was I repaid for the struggle
it had cost me to ask so great a kindness from a
stranger when I saw the comfort that gentle,
noble I eart had given to my mother. He soothed
away all her anxiety about my heresy with tactful
wisdom, bidding her have no fear of difference of
opinion where the heart was set on truth. ‘Re-
member,’ she told me he had said to her—‘remem-
ber that our God is the God of truth, and that,
therefore, the honest search for truth can never
be displeasing in His eyes.’ ”

HIGH-CLASS TAILORING.
WEST END HOUSE,
168 PITT STREET, SYDNEY
(Two Doors from Compagnoni’s.)
THE undersigned, recognising the want of a
FIRST CLASS TAILORING ESTABLISH-
MENT, have OPENED the premises lately occu-
pied by the Bank of Australasia, at 168 PITT-
STREET (THE WEsT *NI) HOl SK) where they
intend to carry on a High-class and Fashionable
Trade.
The public may feel assured that wo shall be
able to maintain a high standard, when we state
that our Mr. Ward has had some yeais’ experience
in the best houses in Lo idon, Paris, as well as in
first-class Sydney Establishments, namely. Farmer
and Co.’s and David Jones and Co.’s.
■Our Mr. Wilson has had fully 30 years’ expe-
rience in the Australian trade, and has just re-
turned from England, where he visited all the
principal Woollen Mills, including that of Hud-
dersfield, as w<fil as West of England and Scotch
Mills. This will be a sufficient guarantee that the
tastes and requirements of the public will receive
the attention they deserve.
In conclusion, wo desire to say that we hope to
obtain a fair share of patronage, in return for
which we guarantee first-class work, all hand-
made, well shrunk, perfect fit, and all in the latest
London and Paris styles.
Soliciting a trial, we remain,
Very truly yours,

THIRTY SHILLINGS.
W THIRTY SHILLINGS,
The trial of Mf. William Webb, of the
Campbelltown Herald, on a charge of having
criminally libelled Sir Henry ParkCs, Was called on,
on Tuesday morning, but postponed till afternoon,
as Mr. Webb had found it difficult to fee counsel
The services of counsel were, however, secured in
the interim. As we go to press, the case had not
been concluded.
Place the asphodel buds 'neath our classic
nose, and soak our tired head In Ylang Ylang.
Says the local speciality man in the Gladesville
Independent: “ A dainty little'Cbfl-year-old fairy
tripped, into my sanctum on Saturday morning
with a bouquet of the most delightful panslca I’ve
seen this season. Flowers are a great institution
in Parramatta. Flora has shed her treasure abroad
with lavish hands, making, with ah their fragrance
and colour, as Swinburne says—
* A r«ln and a ruin of roses
Over the red rose land.’
My little friend was determined not to leave me oat
of this embarras des richesseS—i of which, much
thanks.” What a superficial cuss that fellow is. On
the same day that the dainty fay tripped in, »o., a
patient in the local asylum swallowed a brass but-
ton; old Mrs. M'Gilllcuddy’s goat was confined of
twins, and a Granville milkman was fined 3s. 6d.
for allowing his cow to stray on the railway tract,
and yet never a word is said of these items of all-
atsorblng Interest, but we get a 6-inch par. about
a little fresh vegetation. Besides, it is ungrateful,
too. as not the slightest word of thanks is given to
the man who ran the backyard blockade on the
prevlotis Sunday, but helped the rose-lover along
with a gill of f uifi In a #lnger-beer bottle.
When Sper ger had finished his priae poem
of “The Faery Queen,” he hauled it along to the
Earl of Soutnampton, the Henniker Heaton or
great patron of the poets of that day. The manu-
script being sent up to the Earl, who was in bed
suffering from a recovery at the time, he read a
few pages, and then made a signal to his servant,
who at once darted downstairs and speedily re-
turned with a battle-axe heavy enough to stun a
prlJle blill or split the skull of a Rum reporter.
Alter explaining that the pafty below was not one
of the usual run of bards, Southampton ordered
the man to give Spenser twenty pounds. Heading
on, he soon after exclaimed, with rapture, “John,
bring that man another twenty.” Proceeding still
further, he shouted, “John, hand him yet another
twenty. I’ll make it up to-night at pool.” Com-
mencing the second canto, however, he lost all
patience, and yelled, “John, shoot that fellow out
of the house, for, if 1 read any further, pickle
my blooming dnfiestorsif I won’t be ruined.” Why
we think of Southampton to-day is because we
have just seen a M A. bolding
the horse of the magnificent litefarj genius
who presides over the only JkbnxL. And
this recalls the story of an Australian Spenser
who agreed to do a Christmas Carol for
the unequalled .Tbbnil lor thirty bob, and
who sent his “copy” up-stairs and waited
below for results, Just as Southampton’s singer did
of old. After carefully spelling through the first
verse, the boss thought that 80s. was quite a
heap of money to give for a *' pome.” On
this being told the bard, he said with A flfish, “ All
right, call It flve-and-twenty.” At the end of the
second verse, the distinguished patron thought “ a
not© was quite enough for a thing like that.”
“Gimme the note, and let me go,” was the reply
returned; but when the boy trotted back again
andaske-i if half-a-sov. wouldn’t do if paid down
in cash, the disgusted poet exclaimed, “ For
heaven's sake, tell him not to read any more, or
he’ll bring me in his debtor for five poundsi”

A Perilous Voyage.— The Dallfitfl Ttfwer
has safely arrived in port, after braving the perils
of the stormy deep, encountering terrific hurri-
canes and narrowly escaping being crushed by a
huge Iceberg over two miles long, one of the
largest ever seen. We must congratulate the cap-
tain on his skilful seamanship, as the people of
New South Wales would have suffered serious loss
if the ship had foundered, there being some forty-
sl± rases, bottlon bf the assigned estate of Owen
md James, bought the London House of H. L.

fitters, and consisting of big job lines in boys’ and
youths' suits, and men’s Zephyr masher hats. This
is one of the cheapest consignments ever Imported;
and the goods being bought at a great discount,
Messrs. Summerfleld and Co. intend to give their
patrons some genuine plums. Facts are stubborn
things, and we say that 3000 boys’ linen drill man-o’-
war suits trimmed with blue, with collar and badge,
sizes 000 to 6, are being sold at 5s. lid.; and another
big line of pretty satenne P ince suits, nicely
braided and trimmed, to fit children from two
years to eight years of age, at half the Ehglish in-
voice price, 5s. lid. But this is not all, ladies tak-
ing this favourable opportunity can purchase

The Autophone!
f |>HI8 triumph of musical invention is acknow-
I lodged on all hands to he the
MOST PERFECT, the MOST USEFUL,
and the
MOST ENDURABLE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
of modern times.
It is a wonderful little instrument, which, while
it weighs less than three pounds, has the
LUNGS OP A FULL-SIZED PARLOUR ORGAN
and executes its music with
ABSOLUTE PRECISION AND PERFECT
EFFECT.
It has 33 reeds, plays in three keys, and all the
parts of most difficult music.
To Mr. H. B. Horton, the inventor, the world
was first Indebted for the Organette ; but that was
too expensive to come within the reach of all.
After years of persistent effort and intelligent
study, he has been enabled at last to place before
the world this complete little triumph over all
the difficulties of cost and crudeness.
It requires no skill to extract from it any sort ol
music that may be required, the list of three
hundred tunes which it plays comprising selections
from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes, Polkas,
Marches, Popular Songs, &c., &c., &c. A child cau
play any of these selections with perfect accuracy
The player requires no instruction further than
the few printed directions that ere sent with each
instrument, and are so plain that “ he who runs
may read.” It is best adapted to the kind of music
which suits an organ best, in which chords pre-
dominate ; but it has also wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces. It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card-holder for convenience
in singing. It will be found invaluable for Country
Churches, Sunday Schools, Family Circles, and
for Dancing. Every shanty in the bush should be
supplied with one; and every household which
cannot afford a piano or organ should possess an
Autophone. It will afford greater and better
entertainment 1 ban four times the price can pro-
cure if expended in any other direction. Since
they were appointed Sole Agents for this marvel-
ous little instrument in the Australian Colonies,
18 months ago,
THE ORIENTAL GOLD C0. f
GF
474 George Street, Sydney,
Opposite the entrance to the Fruit Markets,
have forwarded hundreds of them to different
addresses throughout the colonies. Orders have
come to us from remote stations in the far North,
from distant mining camps, from many a lonely
kbepherd on a far-off run, from farm-hands every-
where, from Sunday-school superintendents, from
clergymen, from residents of the cities—from
everywhere, in fact. And one of the best argu-
ments we can offer as to the genuineness of the
instrument, is the fact that, in all our corres-
pondence, we have never had a letter that spoke
disparagingly of it. On the contrary, we have
hundreds of letters on file from customers who
have written only to tell us how greatly they are
pleased with it, and that they will recommend it
to their friends.
It Is conceded by ad educators and moralists
that music Is the great refining Influence, and
especially with children, its effect for good is
boundless. The love for music which music la
the family engenders, is more potent in forming
dispositions and governing tempers than all the
treatises and lectures of the whole force of teach-
ers, pastors, and parents, and in conjunction with
th*»»e, is the oil or balm which renders an other-
wise hard task an easy one.

He stand aloof—they give him room,
He does not with them cluster;
Observe his featureslwrapped in gloom,
His eyes that are “ lack-lustre.”
Despair’s upon his ev’ry glance—
Death seems to be his idol;
For he’s in an unholy trance,
That’s worse than suicidal.
In caverns both his eyes repose,
And. mark you, now, this, lastly—
His v..ice’s tones are simply those
Which Strike on you as ghastly 1
“ What ghoul is this 7” you’ll quickly cry J
“ Who is this gloomy needy 'un ?”
That is, we’ll tell you, with a sigh,
A splendid low comedian I
He sets the pit upon a roar,
His Jokes are new and mellow;
And, oh, the public love him, for
He’s such a “ funny fellow. ’
He sometimes takes a holiday
(’Tie on but few occasions);
Then he does on a tombstone lay,
And reads tho “ Revelations.”

Luscombe Searelle, following up his silo*
bess with “ Estrella ” at the Royal, has produced
“Bobadil” at the Opera House. We attended on
the opening night, and haven’t been since. This
testifies to our unselfishness. You sec, we don’t
want to crowd out the paying audience. The
story upon which Mr. Walter Parke has founded
the libretto was, we believe, once original.
A Sultana told it to her spouse to induce
him not to cut her head off. This shows the trust-
ing nature of woman, and the idiotic character of
Sultans. If Mr. Walter Parke were, for instance,
to Insist on our keeping awake all night while he
read the story to us from his libretto, we wouldn’t
cut his head off, certainly—we would bite It off.
The original series, of which the “ Bobadil ” yarn
is an instalment, ran for a thousand and one nights.
These were Arabian nights, however. We don’t
think Mr. Searelte’s opera will run a thousand and
one nights, but we daresay Mr. Searelle would. If
any of the clever gentlemen who have composed
librettos that no one would set music to, and
operas that no manager would produce, happened
to get on his tracks with a bill-hook.
* ♦ *
The production ot “ Bobadil ” Was interest-
ing for many reasons. In the first place, because
It is composed by Luscombe Searelle, who is almost
an Australian, he having been born, we believe, In
New Zealand, and having developed his musical
abilities in these colonies. There are plenty people
who can remember him, not so long ago, perform-
ing in Sydney, as a phenomenal Juvenile pianist.
11 Bobadil ” is, therefore, the first opera written by
a colonial composer which has been produced for
the first time on the boards of an Australian
theatre. Only one other opera composed in the
colonies has, so far as we know, ever been
produced on the stage at ail. That one is
Vincent Wallace’s “ Maritana,” and the libretto Of
that, like the libretto or “ bobadil,” wa8 written
In London. We prefer “ Maritana.” “ Bobadil ”
Is not Mr. Searrelle’B best effort, the frequent
strains of melody which embellished “Estrella”
being comparatively lacking in “Bobadil,” al-
though »ome of the duets, and notably an accom-
panied quintette in the second act are exceedingly
graceful and harmonious. The cast — strange
how the word reminds us of horses or horse-
shoes or something — is scarcely adequate to
the best possible interpretation of the opeta. Mr,
Harding, to whom the ToOe of Bobadil Is entrusted,
flngs the music right enough, and, on the night of
cur visit, spoke the lines accurately whenever he
could hear Mr. Searelle Prompting. His last solo,
however, was a hit, and resembled the bombard-
ment of the \3hief Mandarin’s house at Foochow.
That hi to say, It brought down the house.
* * *
The Sultan, Haroun al Rasohid, has a
lovely daughter, invented by Mr. Parke, and
Bobadil finishes off by marrying her; although,
judging by the levity of her conduct la perambu-
lating the city In boy’s clothes, he might have had
her on cheaper terms. This fair larriklnesfc is
taken by Miss Grade Planted, who whs as lively as
a kitten with a spool of cotton tied to its tail, and
sang in a manner which reminded us occasionally
of the same kitten, grown up. This was probably
attributable to her parentage, as her stern parent,
the Commander of the Faitblul, had so very poor
a voice that not even a black-mailing reporter
would have dreamed of borrowing a note from it.
• •
Oily Deering and George Leopold were
doubly entertaining—the one as a Court Jester,
who put a good deal of colour into his Jokes, and
who deserves to have evety bone broken, but
especially his blasted trombone (no impropriety
in this expression); and the other as an Armenia i
money-lender, who had anticipated the fate which
we should wish for all in his line—that is to say, he
had turned up his toes.
• • *
The minor characters were full of interest
and sawdust, one nymph in blue would have been
Invisible edgeways but for her calves, which she
seemed to have borrowed from her cousin in the
Permanent Artillery. Another had concentrated
all her talents In her ankles, and she seemed to
have great talents. The Sultan’s son smiled genially
upon the entire proceedings, and in the third act
sang a duet with Lulu In a style which en-
chanted the gods. It was a sort of lightning act,
with constant flashes which made the performer
wink whenever he had a note high enough to be
likely to attract the electric fluid. The composer
was called for at the close of the first act, and
mode a little speech in which he said that Heaven
Kr Sydney, we forget which) was his home, and
that if he had his choice he would rather be an
Australian native than a Hottentot. We under-
stand, however, that when Luscombe was at the
Cape of Good Hope, he used to make little speeches
and say that he would prefer to be a Hottenott
more than anything, except It were a Boer or a
giraffe. On the whole, “ Bobadil ” is an amusing
trifle enough. We should be disposed to place it
in the same category with “Don Giovanni.” and
“ Will you gather by the River,” and “ Les Hugue-
nots.” and “ l hree Blind Mice,” and “ Guillaume
Tell.” In the meantime, anyhow, there’s no other
man born on this side of the world who has at-
tained the position of producing an opera which
has been worthy to put on the stage. Luscombe
Searelle is not a Mozart, truly, but he is a very
clever fellow all round, alike as a musician and a
writer of ballad verses.

Grattan Riggs packs his little shoe-trunk
on Friday night, and lilts to Hobart, whither, we
understand, the gifted AdMe accompanies him,
and where he Is to be further supported by Maggie
Knight. “ The Fairy Circle,” in which Mr. Riggs
has last appeared in, is a fantastic little sketch,
with more poetry than backbone in It, hut which
affords the gifted Grattan a certain scope for the
delineation of Irish character in its many phases.
Handy Andy,” however, which comes after, was
far more to the taste of the audience, and it is but
fair to Mr. Riggs to state that his efforts were the
cause of infinite merriment. Both pieces having
such a decided monologue flavour, necessarily
Preclude the chance of the other players “ getting
into double figures ” (into suen degradation have
we fallen I), and, therefore, it would be, if not in-
vidious, at least monotonous to follow each indi-
vidual actor througa his rugged path of trouble.
• • *
Grattan’s season has been, on the whole,
successful, and he will be followed ocuSaturdav
next by Mr. Charles Turner, Miss Annie slantague,
and a very good crowd, Including Gordon; and M.
Leon Caron is engaged as conductor. Mr. Duncan
Macallum (who has exhausted himself in curses
respecting all that is dioramlc) is Mr. Turner’s ad-
vance agent; and, curiously enough, the minor
members of the troupe are almost identical with
those forming the Montague-Turner Company
when they first opened in Sydney.

We looked round to see Rainer the other
night, and finding him seated on a chair outside
the Academy, we said, “Well, how’s things—
pretty good ?” “Jones has not made a bad stand.”
he replied. “There's not much biz. doing, is
there?” we inquired. “Iknew him,” he replied,
“for fifteen years. Poor Joe.” “How can you
afford to give away pianos with such a b»d house
as this ?” we inquired. “ I always use putty,” said
he, musingly; “ I find it come cheaper.” “Putty?”
we yelled. " Yes, and rosin.” “ But what for ?’we
yelled, breathlessly. “Thank you,” he rejoined;
“it’s jdst about my time. 1 hardly ever—out, as
you’re so press—” “ But what aboiit rosin ? ’ We
whooped. “No, no,’* he Said, wagging his head
jocularly; “no Champagne for me—Scotch whisky
—always Scotch whisky.” But what do you do
with the putty?” we screamed, in despair. “No
more, and be thanked to you; I’m an old man, sir
—an old man.” This is Rainer’s last week, when
he will be succeeded by another opera company.

There was produced ou Saturday night, at
the Theatre Royal, “Lancashire Lass,” a melo-
drama by H. J. Byron, who is dead. It will suffice
to say, in this issue, that Mr. dreville enacted the
r61e of A Party by the Name of Johnson. This in-
timation will draw people to every part of the
house but the dress-circle. And this is a good
thing, for there is all the more room for our little
basket.
" THE POOR PLAY."
[Correspondence is invited from members of the
Theatrical Profession.]
Poor Player! we should think so; and a
lovely item to begin with—the opening of Thomp-
son’s Diorama at Bathuist, by which, it seems, that
W. H. Thompson, Esq., is not only the lessee of the
School of Arts, but the sole proprietor and lec-
turer also. We see that the agent of the oratorical
Thompson is a Mr. H. Eastwood, a g ntleman we
' have with humiliation to confess is unknown to
us| but who 18, probably, Henry Irving or Law-
rence Barrett in disguise. .. And It has come to us
that Mrs. Kendal is now the best-hated actress on
the London stage. The Hefebee says when they
speak of her husband they say “ Poor fellow.”
Mr. Kendal is a true comedian, but he squints. He
seems to be higher, however, in the world drama-
tic than Will. Simpson, who is coming in for a
million. William (that reminds us) is, perhaps, the
champion artist of the woHd in letting off a joke
that is positively pregflant with gloom. The fun-
niest part of Mi. SlmpSbn Is bis foot! and it is
alleged that this dazzled Mr. Arthur Garner entre
deux vine. Not that we believe it, however; for in
the whole of our experience of the picturesque
Arthur, we have never known him drink anything
stronger than naptha with a dash of kerosene.
... And what about the Wollongong Amateur
Dramatic Club wrestling on the 10th Instant
with “The Charcohl'blirner,” and defeating him
with treat slaughter? And how did they
conclude with a nigger farce, in which “Mi*.
Rogersonand company” appeared, to the confu-
sion of the district? But this is nothing to the
Public School concert at Gundagal, where “the
children under Mr. Forsyth sang exceedingly
well,” and “ several ladies and gentlemen of un-
doubted ability assisted both as vocalists and
accompanists,” and conscientiously took It out of
the instrument that had been loaned by an enter-
prising muSic-seller. The proprietor of the piano
Is an amiable and accomplished little foreigner,
and he attended th§ first night to assist at the per-
formance. He waited until the champion thumper
of the district had performed the “ Blue Danube ”
waltzes with hysterical variations, when, with a
pallid face and a sweat-bedewtd forehead, he
noarsely murmured, “ Mon piano, non revfendra
pew.” —At latest. South’s Opera Company were at
Tumut; though we regret io hear that Miss
Theresa Horan, one of the company, is laid up
very sick at Yass....And, let us tell you that Miss
Alice Sydney Burvett has been playing (“she,” as
Thady says, “brings her own grand pianos 1") at
the Towers, and her instrlAmenialism has much
mystified the Winters 1 . Tney can’t ilnlerstatid
why she can’t perform on an Instriiiflent With-
out a tali to it. Miss Alice began with
one of Chopin’s waltzes in drum-major; but
she had to shift to “Rule Britannia,’’ with
involuntary variations, or they’d have eaten her
brother—Fes; and the Mathews Bros.’ circus is
at Bombala. We see they have rolled away the
stone from Barlow’s sepulchre, and that sprightly
young performer now flgu es in the show. The
Mathews’ “push” go io Tasmania, and then re-
turn to play in the Royal pafitomithe. itoe Brown,
by the wAy, is ro localise the pfodutetiten, but he
has not ooththehbed on it ybt; so a suspicion is
gaining ground that he is holding out for another
million... The Mascotte Opera Company is still
perambulating the country districts (Mudgee,
Bathurst, &o.), and Emma Wangenbeim is busy
enslaving country editors. We forget how Jong it
is ago now since we were 6pris of the charming
Emma, but we fanoyit was at a time when Edwin
, Lester was in “ pinnies ” and frilled drawers, and
Emma was engaged in a combat with " The White
Cat,” at the Royal. We remember, one night,
lashed by love into frenzy, proposing to fly with
her, and she acceded. But, ah She woUl’d stop at
the oyster shop fof Srbtteshihenli, prior to
breasting the foaming billow#, she was swooped
down upon by a deputation of the family,
and, in all probability, spanked Maitland,
according to latest dates, has been in a state
of gloom, consequent on Miss Ellen Fergus Ogden
insisting upon playing Romeo. We understand
during one of the entr'actes of this classic per-
formance, a well-read bank clerk, accosting the
Mayor outside the show, and quoting Master
Slender, said, “ Why do your dogs bark so ? Be
there bears i’ the town ?’’ And then the Mayor,
who has a ready wit, straightway quoted “Sweet
Anne Rage,” saying, “I think;there arte, sir. I
heard them talked of.” This 1* a bit diffuse, of
course; though it is here on record that dogs will
bark at a bear, there is no precedent, so far as we
can gather, for their ever howling at a Romeo ..
Fancy I Frank Cates has been playing "The Bells”
in Adelaide. Frank’s ambition appears to be bound-
less. He 11 buy a mule one day, harness it to an
ice-cream cart, and make his fortune.... And Dun-
ning is now back in Adelaide with the eternal
“Boccaccio,” and a lot of girls with big limbs,
and, by way of novelty, Appleby, Loredan, An-
nette Ivanova, Annie Leaf, who used to support
Mr. Harding—how kaleidoscopic is the life theatri-
cal!—and Knight Aston, who, we hear, is in splen-
did voice—a consummation he mildly attributes to
the effects of ginger-ale. ..Then there is “The
Octoroon at the Academy of Music, Maggie
Knight, of course, asZoe; Careyas Salem Scudder;
and Palmer as Jacob M’Closay....Ain’t-it-lovely
Teddy, though, seems to have seceded from Pro-
fessor Anderson, who now gives away Koh-i-noors,
while the greatest ventriloquist in the world is
about to take a pub. We remember Teddy’s last
pub. It was a gorgeous hostelry, and was chiefly
noted tor the slimness of its sausages and for the
obdurate nature of its steak. But it had a fasci-
nation for us, somehow, and we used to detect
ourselves neglecting to punish our landlord, and
stealing round to Teddy’s to hear him lie about his
millions, and build up little fables about the dia-
mond rin ,s that were always deposited at his
bankers. And how does the old familiar cry,
rhythmic in its every cadence, come back to us
after ail these years, when the cruel stew was
borne in relentlessly by the surly “help,” and a
female voice ejaculated the words—“Now, I
cooked it myself. Ain’t it lovely, Teddy ? ...And
you wifl be glad that Georgie Smithson (we always
try to tight against it), who had a buggy accident
recently in Invercargill, and fractured her eyeball
or something, is to be given a ben, and you will learn
with a calm and equable spirit that Chiarini is
doing good biz. in Invercargill; silid that that
giddy young thing, Mrs. G. B. W, Lewds bas been
playing Selim in “ Aladdin ” (thunder!) with Tsddy
Haygarth as Corporal Zoog-Zoog. We understand
that Teddy recently attained his 94th birthday,
when he returned thanks in a happy speech for
the tin of sardines, profusely illuminated, which
was presented to him by the company—Let us
tell you, too, that Miss Tilly, in Wollongong, is
gradually mounting the ladder of fame, rung by
rung. She recently gave a concert at the Temper-
ance Hall, the performers consisting entirely of
infants, who, in the intervals of their perform-
ances on the bottle, sang concerted pieces with
much eclat. .. And of course St. Leon’s circus is at
Moruya, and advertises “two hundred men and
horses.” We consider that there is a melting
modesty about this announcement which would do
credit to any bell-man And here is the latest
about Rlstori. She is very rich, and lives in sump-
tuous apartments in the Boulevard Malesherbes,
Paris, adjacent to that palatial residence which
erstwhile was known as THotel de Christophavie-
bennette.


PEPPER AND SALT.
ODE TO THE “ECHO” “NIHILIST.”
Enlarging on English ideas,
Dear scribe, you with vehemence ravo
At that horrid North Pole, which has lured
So many men on to the grave.
But, in search of a subject for scorn,
Say, why to world’s end need you roam ?
Should not censure, like charity, first
Be bestowed upon objects near home ?
You tediously labour to prove
That your ancestors ought to be spurned;
But, if they could speak, don’t you think
That the compliment would be returned
You say that they were a bad lot—
No doubt the assertion is true;
But is it not lucky that they
Cannot give their opinion of youl
Out-Heroding Herod, you wish
Every baby forthwithlto destroy:
Would to Heaven this doctrine obtained,
When you were a girl—or a boy 1
The “ country,” and all it affords,
You treat with the utmost disdain;
But its crops and its herds will increase,
Though your smile never greet it again.
You say that in picnicing now,
No pleasure or joy can be found;
Wo don’t doubt you, dear \ -’tls the case,
Whenever you travel around.
We join with you when you assert,
Some picnics too quiet by half;
But, If you want pleasure, just go,
Next holiday, down to Ctontarf!
Farewell! stick to Nihilist maxims,
Abolish all things that exist;
Note each down tor early destruction,
And—place yourself first on the list!
Abolish our rulers and princes,
The offspring and lineage of Guelph;
But, firstly—again we would ask it—
Take care to abolish yourself!

“Sympathy,” in the Parked Gazette,
wishes “space to make a few remarks about a
funeral.” It seems a man named Antram, who
had lived for 20 years in Forbes, died, a pauper, in
the hospital, having never “during that long
term,” says “ Sympathy,” “ even blotted his ex-
cutcheon (sic).” Much to “Sympathy’s” sorrow,
however, the “fun’l” was poorly attended; and
“Sympathy” is the more surprised at this, as he
naively informs the editor that the deceased used
formerly to play the trombone in the brass band.
This noble troupe of sworn torturers rolled up>
however, and—we quote “Sympathy”—“played
in front of the costege (sic) the ‘ Dead March in
Saul.’ It was really refreshing to witness the con-
trast of feeling displayed by the bandsmen, as
compased (sic) with the heartless behaviour of
some, who had known the late Mr. Antram so
thoroughly,” &o. Whoever “Sympathy” is, he
seems to have a good heart. Something whispers
us that the man who nan lind anything “refresh-
ing” about a funeral must be an undertaker. If
so, hinc ilhv lachryma.! Evidently all the deceased
performer was treated to, in the coffin line, was “ a
plain pine with a tin plate;” while, had popular
feeling been aroused, it would have probably run
to a mock mahogany shell, with brass screws and
a cretonne lining.

The Moruva Examiner’s poet has been
“at it” again, and has got at the editor of the
paper (who, we believe, is his grandmother) to set
up some more of the poetical dripping from his
Parnassian brain. It seems the Moruyans played a
cricket match with the Boys of Bega, and received
at the hands of the latter an instalment of gruel
that would have satisfied a giant. On this the
Maro of Moruya tuned up his gridiron to a lyric,
out of which we chop the following metric*!
chip: —
“ And, though we must congratulate
Our friends who won,
We’ll do it in a manly way,
Not blaming those who lost,
For all must own that our men were
Less practised than the rest ” (sic).
Let’s add our little merry mite to this, in the way
of a modest _
Warning.
Now, once we knew a bard like you,
Whose soul’s outpourings welled;
He, “ in his tracks,” fell 'gin an axe,
"That someone, somehow, held.
And at dawn’s glim did they lay him
Beneath the “ wave-worn stones ? ’
What!!! No darned fear! the maidens here,
Made brooches of his bones.
“A New Chum” writes a poem in the I
Cootamundra Herald, which that powerful
organ is cruel enough to “run on.” The work is,
nevertheless, deserving of notice, since it presents
many original features. He commences with
commendable frankness, coming at once to the
point:—“Being a new chum and out of work, I
will write a few lines on the Melbourne Cup."
There is a certain merit in this-if only from the
fact, as Mr. Weller says, “There is nothing about
Wenus in it.” He soon, however, carols in a loftier
strain. Mark:—“What I write is from my own
brain, I will not borrow another man's fame.”
Though this Homeric couplet does not contain
more than a poor halfpenny worth of rhyme, it is
perfectly saturated with reason. We should say
that man could make almost anything out of his
own head—caulking mallets, for instance; and
supply the oakum from his brain. The quality of
bis “pitch” is already en evidence. But to pro-
ceed. At the Cup he was struck with “select
groups of walkers, all well-dressed and attentive
talkers,” which proves him to be of an observant
nature. The following criticism, we mildly think,
is open to question:—“ The ladies dress very neat
rather stiff and sedate. Some are large and
stout, with much muscle [II]; while more are
small and thin with very much bustle.’*
The classification here exhibits a considerable
knowledge of human nature, but the sedateness*
we think, evinces on the part of the bard a slight
tendency to overcolour. This, too, we consider
slightly below “ A New Chum’s ” lofty standard:—
“I saw some fast young gentlemen, who prided
themselves on their breed and blood. The breed
of fast men I never understand.” But he soon re-
asserts himself, as will be seen by the following:—
“Now for the larrikin class—rich and poor, I will
write impartial I am sure. Of the larrikin class I
do not know much about; they seem addicted to
saver (sic) and shout.” Well, one can’t be expected
to know everything—hence, doubtless, our ignor-
ance of the meaning of the verb “ to saver.” Ha
the bard ended here, all would have been well,
but we regret to chronicle that ho now falls wit
startling suddenness from his high estate. No
content with proving himself to be worthy of bays,
he now, in a most unmistakeable manner, pu
forth his little palm. Read, and weep:—“I beg a
subscription for my father and mother, a poor
blind sister and a crippjed brother. . , • °
Saviour begged, according to Scripture; I beg 10
my parents, brother and sister.” Now, swee
bard, tlap your expectant ear this way :—
T Ve'll give you—for we arc not mean—
Our dole tor this gay'stuff; ,
But, bide a wee—it has not been
In pickle long enough.

The other day a Maitland reporter started
for Morpeth on horseback, to report a meeting*
but, encountering a few convivial friends in the
pub,, he forgot all about the business he had come
about until the thing was over. So, after three
rounds of drinks more, ho mounted, and com-
menced to ride back. “ I must have some copy,”
he muttered, moodily, “ or ” At this moment
he was pitched off on his head. But, even as he
lay on the road metal, a smile lit up his blood-
stained countenance; and, getting with difficulty
his note-book out of his pocket, he commenced, in
the moonlight, to pen a par. commencing “Fright-
ful (hie) condition of the roads.”

Here’s a breezy little item from the Cum-
berland Nobbs, which our Blue Ribbon tract,
compilers would do well to collar, as it is not one
of the usual 18d.-a-hundred faked-up yarns de-
scriptive of the disastrous effects of the demoralis-
ing bottle, but is, in point of fact, a downright
stern reality. “Mr. Stieme,” wo are told, “met
with a very painful accident at the Masenio Hall
while Mr. Read’s closing ball was going on. He
walked out of the ballroom to sit in the open air
about 3 o'clock a.m., and unconsciously sat down
upon a piece of a bottle which was upon a seat at
the rear of the building. A wound of a consider-
able length and depth was caused, and the blood
flowed in torrents.” Mr. Stieme sleeps face down-
wards now, and has a strong dislike to sit on any-
thing harder than the lapse of ages-say, from
sweet sixteen up to two-and-twenty. Verily, the
bottle is at the bottom of at least three parts of all
the misery that now afflicts the world.

We were reading in the Manning River
opaper of an instance of far-sightedness which oc-
curred up there lately. It was not much of an in.
stance, but it reminds us of a story we were told
by a veracious person the other day regarding a
similar thing. He was on board an Immigrant ship
that came out here lately. There was a lot of Irish
on board also. These were clustered on the fo’k’s le

lights were beginning to glow, it being night time*

time it was pitch dark. “ Ooh, Bedha hursht," said
another, “there are no kyabins out here—they’re

haired Tyrone man, who was nearing hard into
the gloom. “ Hould your whisht!” ho answered
impatiently, “an’ a’Jl tell ye.” He was the far-
sighted man, and so they waited respectfully till
he had finished his observations. “ Bhoys,” he
said. “I see a house.” “Yis, Owney.” “And
there’s an ould cailloch standin’ forninst the

The native drink in Egypt is called
“ Boosa.” It has been so-called since the first
Pyramid was built. Hence our slang phrase—
which now we find is not a slang phrase—“ Booso. i
We venture to say that when philology becomes
an exacter science it will be discovered that all our
slang phrases are genuine natural words embedded
in prehistoric tongues. We would not be asto-
nished to find that the patriarchs constantly com-
municated with each other in a dialect which is
now only known as argot, and relegated to thieves
and aldermen. Wo offer the suggestion to Max
Muller. Fancy Isaac saying unto Methusaleh:
“Tip us your fin, old boss, and uame your poison,”
or Mahalaleel unto Solomon, “ I’ll raise you half a
Jimmy I turn up the Jack first gol” The dis
covery of these matters would tend greatly to
humanise the study ot philology, and cast a tender
light upon our common nature as it was from the
beginning.

Queer thing is taste. We read somewhere
the other day, that the latest fancy ot Parisian
ladies is to have landscapes and miniature por-
traits painted on their finger-nails by accomplished
artists. It is a delicate fancy. What must be the
rapture of the lover returned from long absence
to find the portrait of himself, painted before he

DAVE BUCHANAN (putting on Parkes' Left-off Suit): “THERE, NOW. I MAKE JUST AS GOOD A PROTESTANT HERO.”


Speaking of the local brass band tne
Moruya paper says: “What the boys want is a
little kindly sympathy from the public; also some
of the help that the Quaker gave the man when he
lost his donkey, viz, pecuniary assistance to pur-
chase a drum with.” It was cheerful assistance,

accordion to a man who had lost his aunt, or a
trumpet to a boy who had lost his father. But It

left, still glistening on the filbert thumb-nail of his
lady! How his heart must thrill with holy emo-
tion, such as hard unsensltive natures never feel,
to know she kept that memorial nail sacred from
soap through all the weary time! It is a beautiful
idea. There is a maiden whose face is seldom ab-
sent from our dreams—when we are sober—upon
whose treasured thumb-nail it would be our highest
aspiration to see our features shine. It would, if
the thing were possible. But, alas, it Is not.
Her fairy fingers have to dabble in the wash-tub,
and our portrait would, therefore, last but one
brief day, which would .hardly justify the expense
of its production. Yet we are consoled for this
deprivation by knowing—but let us wing it. Song
is the language of love. Softly, now—
For this small deprivation, dearest o ne,
No gloom our bosom fills;
We are as cheerful as the summer sun—
For though you play the laundress’ humble part-
We know our picture’s traced upon your heart,
Our name upon your hills!
So let the little maiden slide. But before passing
on to other themes, we will say that this custom
of the Parisian ladies is outdone by a largo number
of prominent persons in this city, from members of
Parliament to ministers of the Gospel. We have
seen it. Not content with pictures of landscapes
on their nails, they carry a landscape Itself—or
rather, perhaps, a landslip— wider them.
SWEET AND LOW.
Sweet and low Is the young man’s voice
A-coaxing of the young maiden:
her little heart for to rejoice,
So sweet and low is it then.
But turned it is to a tenderer pitch,
When ho finds that the gate is barred,
A-coaxing of the saw-toothed bulldog which
Is a-roaming around the yard.

Says the Adelaide correspondent of the
Karunda Herald, re the late cricket match;—
“ very disagreeable ijnpresgion has been created
by their play. It has been freely asserted that
wickets wore designedly lost by the Englishmen*
. . Their play has been flagrant.”
You funny little scribe, why then
It really seems that you
Esteem your tale about these men
As something that is new.
It never dawned on you, now say,
You small Kapunda creeter,
The secret of this flagrant play
Was centred in the “ Peter T’

A tragedy of Utting, which
At one fell time when he lacked gold,
In darkling eve, with bated breath.
His work he to the tripe-shop sold;—
A par. of Alf.’s they wouldn’t print,
Although he wrote itev’ry line,
And said the picnic-feed “took well.
Though sower the kolonian wine.”
But, as for dug-up symphonies.
And tuney trifles of that kind.
We can assure you they don’t make
The least impression on our mind.
BRIEF MENTION.
There are at present 1,000,000 Irish in Aus-

A centipede was found in a helpless staet
of intoxication in an hotel in Yass a few days ago.
He had been sent to the editor of one of the
papers originally as one of unusual size, and—
Yes, that will account for it being discovered in a

He rang the bell at 2 a.m. so violently that

pal magnate, a clergyman, and a prominent
official. Well, they didn’t go in. But, probably,
had he sent down pictures of a wombat, a goose,
and a goat, we might have been deceived.
The Queen is only slowly recovering from
her accident. So did we, when we fell across a
case of whisky left by the last tenant. It was
fully a week before we were able to take even
“gentle exercise.” Then we did it leaning on the
arm of an attendant, whose attachment to our
person prevented him from leaving us on any
account. How these things occur.
Her Majesty the Queen was cruelly sold
not long ago. A woman gave birth to three
children in a workhouse. The local clergyman
was informed of the fact by someone who was
either a gay wag or a hopeless Idiot, and accord-
ingly his reverence wrote off claiming the Queen’s
Bounty for the mother. The usual £3 was sent
and handed over before the clergyman found that
the children were illegitimate!
JUSTIFIABLE.
Put her in her little shell
(You’ll not see me weep);
Mind you do the f un’ral well,
And mind you do It cheap.
That hatchet did it clean and nice—
I don’t call it a sin;
She heard the milkman calliout twice,
And wouldn’t take it In.
On sent les neiges d’autan? (for the sake
of your grandfather who was hung set this sen-
tence up correctly, O printer I) This is one of the
few frequently quoted lines of poor Fran?0ls Vil-
lon. He had a nard life of It. But that was not
enough. Even his after fame must be denied him.
A goblin of the name of Wills writes in the Auck-
land Observer an imitation of one of his ballads
with a translation of the line referred to prefixed
and attributed to—“ F. Dillon!” After this, we
are only surprised that Wills did not mention that
he knew Dillon well and had many a quart of beer
with him. Wills himself is probably a wombat.
Armidale is to be illuminated with gas,

Compagnoni’s have adopted the Continen-
tal plan of holding matinees two afternoons in the

Quick as follows the thunder’s crash to the
lightning’s flash, came the effect to the cause of an
incident which happened this side of the lino last
week. On Monday morning a raving lunatic
escaped from the Yarra Bend Asylum. On Thurs-
day he crossed the Border; and on Saturday the
following par. enlivened the pages of the Gwydir
Examiner and Fishshops’ Friend Accident.
On Sunday last a lad named Robert Griffin, who
was out riding with his brother, sustained a serious
wound on the leg, which had to be stitched up, by
being kicked whilst riding behind the latter’s
horse.” The stitching up of a serious wound by
means of a horse’s kick is, we imagine, quite a new
idea in the way of surgery; and the pity of it is
that the operation was not repeated on the head of
the mule that wrote the paragraph.
Who’s which? and which’s who? are two
prize conundrums which are evidently greatly
exercising the gigantic brain of the Bennetts just
at the present date. Speaking of the “man-
eaters ” operated on by Professor Sample a few
days ago, the Bindley Murray of the Nooze ob-
served: “The second horSe exhibited was the
property of Mr. John Free, a fine chestnut mare,
who had only been handled once before.” How
Mr. John Free managed to metamorphose himself
into a fine chestnut mare is not explained. But all
this was eclipsed in next day’s suckin’ edishun,
when we were confidently told that, at the
Bemenyi concert, “ the performance commenced
with a piano solo by Mr. Luokstone, which ex-
hibited considerable grace and precision of touch.”
Judging from this, we should infer tbit the piano
solo played upon Mr. Luckstone; but, anyway,
the two items show the phenomenal wisdom of
saving a few shillings a week by employing a
wood-and-water Joey to report, tor a “ respect-
able journal,” on a cat-fight in the morning and a
high-toned classical concert the same evening.
The cricket match between the English
professionals and eleven of New South Wales,
came to a conclusion on Monday last, and although
at the end of the respective first innings the game
looked very open, the Australians tailed off like
rotten sheep in their second effort, and the visitors
proved the victors by four wickets and a run. An
immense attendance put in an appearance on
Saturday, when the two teams were seen both at
the wickets and in the field. Taken all round, the
fielding of the Colonials was execrable, barring
Evans and Massie, who showed exceptionally
good form. No less than eight lives were
given away to toe visitors by mistakes in the
field. Though there were in the field as fine, if
not finer, men than Massie in point of physique, he
showed out pre-eminentiy by reason of the innate
grace with which his every sway and undulation
of the bodv was replete, and when looking at him
on Saturday we could not help thinking that
the British yokels must have had an eye for
something more than eggs and bacon when
they christened him “ The Deer.” Amongst
other pieces of bad fielding, Garrett dropped a
very easy one off Bates. Attewell, who was nfe-ct-
vis to Bates, started to run, but Bates did not reci-
procate, and Garrett made amends for his miss by
smartly running with the ball to the vacant
wicket and giving Attewell his quietus. Appended
are the complete scores:—New South Wales —First

For ways that are dark, the heathen
Chinee isn't a circumstance by the side of the
genuine gold-diggings bummer. When a matter
of work turns up, the bummer lies as dead as a
knot in a pine log; but when it comes to a ques-
tion of procuring free grog he combines the
activity and meanness of a bob-tailed skunk with
the fertility of Invention of a Munchausen or a
Continental war correspondent. A prime sample
of this genus came to light the otnec day on me
Crocodile Creek diggings near Rockhampton.
Being blest with the insatiable thirst of an elec-
tioneering tout on poll day. this worthy jpker
made two punctures in the calf of his leg with a
pin and then, rushing Into the nearest pub., called
out that he was bitten by a black snake, and re-
nueated leave to lie down, as he felt tne deadly
wymptoms of sleep coming fast upon him.
“ Jumpin' Jezabel,” roared the landlord, don t
do that, man, or you’re a gone coon for certain.
Here, take this bottle of brandy, and walk about
and drink it.” Half an hour after this, that bum-
mer was the gayest man on the whole dig-
gings. Divesting himself of his clothes, he
smeared his body all over with red mud. stuck
a lot of hay and wattle bark through his
hair, and grabbing a long-handled 'hovel he re-
turned to his benefactor, wrecked the whole bar,
split a tunnel through the landlord s bead, chased
his wife under the bed, threw the baby into the
creek, rammed the nigger cook into a horse-
trough, and nearly scrubbed him to death with a
mixture of soap and brick-dust. After this, he
kicked down the post-olflce, rubbed the post-
master’s horse all over with kerosene and set him
alight, routed the whole Chinese camp, tired the
lock-up, and thou st irted off on the back ol a wild
cow for Rockhampton. It was the pnroest day s
sport that bummer ever bad since he broke out of
the Woogaroo lunatic asylum three years before;
the total damage done by that one bottle of snake-
juice came to £3 13s., and a Kanaka who acci-
dentally smelt the cork has been lamed for life in
consequence. The lesson to be learnt from this is
when a Rockhampton snake bites a man it is far
better for him to hold on to the ills he has than to
fly to others which will necessitate a ruinous in-
crease in the number of grave-yards and lunatic
asylums.
An Englishwoman gives a graphic account
of how aristocratic Parlslennes carry on the fancy
fair business. It is notorious that many of them
go into the business, under the guise of charity,
with just the same motives as they would go Into
private theatricals—for self-display and gratifica-
tion. A celebrated prelate lately issued a circular
to his fair flock, enjoining them to exercise a little
more becoming modesty. Aristocratic ladies, got j
up like denizens of the demi-monde, smiled, and
handled male visitors freely. And mixing in the
crowd were ladies of the green-room got up like
ladies of the real world, who behaved more freely
still. It was no use men trying to evade them.
The pretty spiders soon got used to it, and, with
Inimitable skill, when they attempted an evasion
managed to Jam them against the walls with a
sharp twist of their “ diess-improvers.” The
clothes most of them wore must nave cost three
times as much as all the money they collected;
while the dominant thought in their minds was
certainly more envy than charity. To get more
than their sisters was the aristocratic aim, and
women who could have paid out of their own
pockets ten times what they collected, without
feeling poorer, stood there for hours together
with anguish and malice in their hearts. To
spite a rival extortionist, and fill own her money
bag, one pretty actress actually—really, I can’t
tell it; but we stood there and heard it several
times, and she was several sovereigns to the good.
But she was one of the really pretty ones. Sara
Bernhardt was to collect one afternoon. But
there was no more charming woman there than
Emilie Broisat, the actress, though she is over
forty. The most successful woman with men is
unquestionably Judic. Her eyes, her arms, her
hand, her voluptuous smile, are irresistible. Each
deluded fly, of course, thinks the glance is for him
alone, the smile for him alone, the manner of ap-
proaching him peculiarly and exceptionally sweet.
Judic is an artist from the top of her fascinating
head to the sole of her pretty foot. Most people
agree with the Archbishop in denouncing these
bazaars. They are too often mere pretexts for
immodest displays of shoulders, dangerous dally-
Ings over roses, and serve as convenient cloaks for
disreputable Intrigues innumerable. Charity that
is bom of vanity, corruption, and impurity, de-
serves no admiration. Charity in Its new Parisian
dress is little better than stieet mendicancy, and
not a great deal better sometimes than street-
walking

It is stated by a London paper that “Dr.
H. L. Cortis. the champion bicyclist, died in N.8.W.
attho beginning of August.” The Dr. is privi-
leged. It is not every man that has a chance to
read his own obituary notice.
In the 32nd annual boat race for the
French championship, Lein, who has regularly,
since 1876, carried off the Champion’s Cup, given

and Indeed only came In third. D. D’Hautefuellle
was the winner.
There is an Invention spoken of which, it
is thought, mav abolish the bit. It is called the
carrago, or anti-horse torture. It is composed of
a steel band placed over the front bone of the
horse’s nose, and to this appliance the reins are
attached. It has been tried with satisfactory re-
sults.
In face of the warning edict of the
stewards’of the English Jockey Club against the
heavy bettmg of trainers and jockeys, one of the
former class made no secret of having won £11,000
on two races at Kempton Park last week, and a
leading jockey laments having lost over £3000 at
Doncaster.
We must go from home'for news. The
Glasgow Herald states that Watson, the cele-
brated yacht designer, has on band drawings tor a
10-ton cutter for Mr. Williams of Sydney, the
measurement of which will be lift. 6in. by 7ft. Jin.
Watson was the designer of the lines from which
the Oithona was put together.
A Manchester man and friends entered the
local cricket ground (on the occasion of the match
between the county club and the Australians) at
3 40 p m. The weather caused play to be sus-
pended ten minutes after he had entered the field.
Annoyed at this, and feeling he had not received a
rmiiI. pro quo for the 18s. expended, he asked for
the return of his money. This being refused, an
action was entered. Verdict for defendant.
The refusal of a returned Australian Eleven
man to play for his colony in the late international
match was about as consummate a piece of impu-
dence—not to speak of Ingratitude—as we bavo
dropped across for some time past. What cricket
has done for the young gentleman in question, it
is scarcely necessary for us to remind our readers.
But the old saw again outs in—Put a gentleman of
limited moans on horseback, &c.
The Weekly Dispatch coolly remarks,
apropos of the fact than an Englishman named
Strickland is said to have plunged 73ft. lin. from a
divinff-board 5ft. above the water, that Austra»
Han ‘ records ’ are, as a rule, very peculiar, and
that unless they can be supported by testimony
such as we can understand and accept they must
always be passed over as at least doubtful. 1 For
Internal John Bullish impudence this would be
hard to beat.
On Saturday last, races for 24-footers and
30ft. half-deckers were sailed in connection with
the Sydney Amateur Sailing Club. For the 24ft.
race the starters were the Victor, Dreamland,
Lottie, and Adelnhi; and the boats finished in the
order named. The half-deckers finished Nereus,
Warganella, and Elaine. The Nereus is a hand-
some little craft, built by Golding, an amateur, of
Balmain. She is finished in first-class stylo through-
out, her appearance being greatly enhanced by a
rosewood dock, French polished.
The following rSmme of sporting men’s
fortunes is given in the N.Y. Police Gazette:—
Edward Hanlan, £10,000; Wallace Ross, Hosmer,
Plaisted. and Teemer, £1060 to £3000; John L. Sul-
livan, £30,000; Billy Madden, £3000; Coburn, £4000;
John Morrissey and Jem Mace made several for-
tunes, which they lost in gambling. Weston, the
pioneer “pedestrian” of the world, made £6000;
Rowell, £12.000; Ennis and Fitzgerald, £3000 each;
Harding, £1400; Harriman, £3000; and Duncan C.
Ross cleared £6000 In wrestling matches.
Charley Mitchell, the English pugilist, who
appears to have gained in avoirdupois at the ex-
pense of science, on the 13th Oct. engaged in a
four-round set-to with Dominick M'Caflrey, of
Pittsburg (U.8.), at Madison Square Garden, N.Y.
It was not till the Anal round that any smashing
work was indulged in. At the termination of the
bout, both men were completely played out, and
everyone in the place considered it a draw; but to
the surprise of all the referee gave the battle in
favour of M'Caffrey. Mitchell now wishes to have
another “ shy ” at him.
Morley the cricketer’s wife and children
are left almost unprovided for. Morley’s visit to
Australia might have set him up, but for the un-
fortunate accident to the mail steamer in which
the Hon. Ivo Bligh’s team were proceeding to the
antipodes. After that Morley never pulled him-
self together, and lost his bowling, as the phrase
goes. The accident affected him mentally as well
as physically. W® remember that in Sydney he
had as companion the Victorian cricketer and
football player, George Coulthard. The latter
was then far gone in consumption, and Morley,
who was apparently unwell, but not ill, was told
off to keep him company. Both have now joined
the great majority. Morley was but 34 when he
died.
W. Reid, of Glebe Point, who recently
turned out for “Podge” Newton the handsome
and fast working boat Admira 1 , has just planked
up a 32-foot racer for the Messrs. Longfield. She
is about 8ft. 3in. beim, and something over 6ft.
across the tuck; and, given a good “turn out”
and an efficient handler of the pick-handle, we
should not be surprised to see her give oven Mr.
Clarke’s handsome Rosetta her quietus. Wo
understand her maiden effort will be at the New-
castle regatta, in the hands of “Podge” Newton,
when she will probably meet the St. Crispin. The
boat is put together in first-class style, and we
shall be very much disappointed if she does not
turn out a regular flyer.
The famous European gambler Dupressoir
has just died. Dupressoir was the man that ran the
gambling tables at Baden Baden before their sup-
pression in 1872. He was the head and front of all
the progressive Improvements in that beautiful
watering-place. After the Kelchftag had sup-
pressed gambling, Dupressoir went to Monte Carlo
to manage that earthly paradise on a salary of
£4000 a year. But he soon tired of the Riviera,
went to Paris, and made a proposition to the
French Government, which M. Theirs declined on
the ground of public morality. What the gambler
proposed was that he should have the exclusive
privilege of running sporting houses at Nice, Biar-
ritz, Dieppe, Boulogne, and Fontalnbleau, for
which privilege he was willing to pay cash down
30,000,000f., anOnnuaily thereafter 4,000,000f. dur-
ing a period of fifty years. He died a comparatively
poor man.
Mr. Jack Macnamara wishes us to state
that he is willing to run Malone for anything, from
9d. to £5000. Wo asked Jack how he came to be a
pedestrian, and he explained that at the time he
wore frilled drawers his dreams were to be an
angel, and every night he used to kneel down and
say his little Iprayer requesting Heaven to make
him an angel as soon as convenient. Years passed
on, and no halo was handed down to him, so he
then resolved to be the next thing in brightness
and glory to a seraph—a professional runner.
Jack says he always wins, unless he is seized with
the cramps, or falls down, or is dosed before start-
ing, or the other man is too good for him. No man
has, however, proved too good for him, but
Malone, though Jack explains that on the day of
his contest with Mr. M. he had the cramps, fell
down, and was dosed before starting. Both Mr.
Macnamara and bis friends are very confident, and
as we are fired with the desire to win a few mil-
lions, we shall certainly put a trouser-button on
Jack.
Paddy Pigott, one of our best top-weigbt
jockeys, and as desperate a post-finisher as ever
sported silk, made his first appearance in the pig-
skin, since his terrible fall in the Melbourne Cup
of 1883, at the last Melbourne carnival, and, strange
to say, he rode the same horse that he got his spill
from, viz.: The Plunger. Luck was hard on
Paddy, however, and although he tore into the
straight with a lead of two lengths The Plunger
collapsed as soon as ever Commotion touched his
girths. In the Melbourne Stakes. Paddy landed
the son of Argus Scandal second to Malua, and he
also steered Lady Claudia in the Maribyrnong, and
Leporello for the Derby. With the exception of
Johnnie Cutts, Pigott is the only jock, who has
succeeded in winning the Melbourne Cup twice,
which he did in 1874 on Harrloot, and in 1877 on the
mighty Chester, whom he also landed first for the
V.H.C. Derby the same year. Paddy has now de-
cided to settle down in Melbourne where, he in-
tends to not only ride but also train. Owners
on the look out for a thoroughly competent and
honest man to take charge of their flyers would
do well to fix their eyes on Paddy.
The Australian mail, carrying the detailed
account of the Hanlan-Beach match arrived in
London at 10 p.m, of Friday, October 3rd. The
morning: papers ot Saturday had not a line about
the event; even the Daily Sportsman appeared
without it! The evening papers, which issue their
first editions just after mii-day, apparently knew
nothing of the arrival of the mail, and so contained
no allusion whatever to the matter, for particulars
concerning which even the general public had
been anxiously looking. It was not that the
editors cared nothing for the event, for they had
been printing columns, and half-columns, and
quarter-columns of elaborate speculations as to
what nows the mall would bring when it did come
to hand. The rem ssness was simply due to utter
ignorance on the part of the London newspapers
concerning Australian mails and all other things
Australian, in the end, Patchett Martin handed
to the editor of the Echo, at about three o clock, a
slip cut from the Sydney D.T.. which, wonderful
to relate, was reproduced the same evening m the
Echo’s last edition. The conclusion speedily ar-
rived at by anyone who sees a little of the inner
life of the London press is that when what in
England is known as a “ big thing ” is done, it is
almost invariably accomplished by the sheer
brutal force of money, and net by the force of wit.
The Times is the only London daily which has an
Australian correspondent, and the city editor of
the Standard the other day printed a statement
in his money article that Melbourne had 35,000 in-
habitants !! 1
Just after the Prix de Fortifications, at
Longchamps races, Paris, the noble French public,
dissatisfied with the result, Isorlously 'maltreated
Sharpe, the jockey who rode Blonde II., the Duo
de Castries’ mare. He was pulled off the animal,
and while on the ground was kicked and beaten in
a most unmerciful manner. The animal was also
injured by blows from sticks, stones, and um-
brellas. Sharpe was taken into the weighing
ground in an alarming condition. The soldiers
had to guard the weighing-room from the in-
furiated mob, one of whom was seized by three
jockeys, and was only saved from being lynched
through the intervention of the police. The
iockeys had already pulled off the fellow s clothes,
and were about to hang him. The weighing-room
was veritably besieged during the space of half an
hour. Storr, the jockey who rode Infldele, was
also maltreated on coming in after the race, but
was able to go home in a cab. Sharpe, however,
was found to be so seriously hurt, that it was con-
sidered dangerous to remove him from the weigh-
ing-room. The dastardly conduct of the crowd
appears to have been altogether due to the ig-
norance of the persons who had a pecuniary in-
terest in the race. The event passed off in a regu-
lar manner. Carrat, who rode Georgina, seeing
that he was sure to win, pulled in the mare, Sharpe
at the same time endeavouring to get up to him.
Carrat then spurred Georgina, and made a dash
forward, leaving Blonde II. behind. The crowd
immediately cried out “Thief!” and commenced
their manifestations of ill-will against Sharpe.
Lacrosse is only in its infancy in New
South Wales, and we look forward with longing to
the period when lovers of the Canadian “ national
irame ” will be able to show us a little championship
form. Then will football, canine controveisiee,
( and Queensberry matches have to take a back
seat. In a par. under the heading of “ The World s
Championship,” the N.Y. Clipper says:—"The
lacrosse match for the championship between the
Shamrock Club of Montreal, nolders of the cham-
pionship, and the Toronto Club, from whom the
former won it at the beginning of this season,
took place at the former city Sept. 2T. Although
the weather was most unfavourable, raining all
the time, and the field covered in places with pools
of water, a multitude of spectators paid for en-
trance. Both teams went to work with a vigour
and roughness never equalled in Canada. The first
game was contested with extraordinary pluck and
valour, for no quarter was given on either side for
forty-seven minutes, when Green won the game
for the Shamrocks. The second game was fought
inch by inch for thirty-five minutes, whenHubbell
carried the goal with a brilliant throw for the
Torontos. The third game was the most exciting
of all. After thirty-seven minutes’ play, it was
pronounced drawn, the referee deciding time up.
The following were disabled and had to be carried
off the field: Dwyer, Oregan, M‘Kay, and Daly of
the home team, and Bonnell of the Torontos.
Some had fractures on the head, arms, and legs,
while others had dislocated shoulders. The play
was the most exciting and scientific ever witnessed
there, but it was offensive from the brutality in-
dulged In.”
“Pendragon ” in the Rbferbe writes that
“ beyond great surprise at the issue, and still
greater self-glorification, there is little enough to
be learnt from the Sydney newspaper accounts of
the Hanlan-Beaoh race.” He remarks that in the
matter of fine writing, not to say tall talk, some of
the accounts out-do even the most extreme trans-
atlantic efforts on like occasions, and adds that
a few lines he has received from; correspondents
whose letters arrived by the mall which brought
the papers “are worth any amountof the delirious
joy which has found its way into local print over
the vengeance which had at last overtaken the
conqurero of previous Kangarooland representa-
tives.” The “few lines” referred to consist of a
letter from “ a member of the London R.C. now on
a visit to Australia” and one from “ another trust-
worthy correspondent.” The former says that
“ Hanlan was taking it easy and laughing when
the steamer bore down upon him. He seemed to
consider for a minute whether he should run into
it, but, deciding not to do so, pulled half a dozen
strokes and left Beach as if he were standing sMll.
Hanlan then appeared to be looking round to find
something else to run into, and finally pulled across
Beach’s bows. After that he began to make most
desperate signs of rowing very hard and being
quite pumped—rounding his back, splashing, etc.,
in something very unlike ‘Banian form.’*' The
“other trustworthy correspondent” insinuates, if
he does not actually state, that the race was sold.
For instance:—" Here is something that looks very
fishy. One of the chief sporting hotel-keepers
here who made the match for Hanlan on the
Nepean with Laycook. on Friday night sent a com-
mission of £1000 to £500 on Hanlan. On Saturday
morning he withdrew this, and backed Beach to
the same amount! Me said he had heard that Han-
lan was not fit. Hanlan, dndeed, did not seem to
care to make himself fit. At four o’clock, just
before the race started, he was drinking beer in a
room full of men smoking. A friend told me this
who i imself handed Hanlan the beer.” It’s a great
pity that in N.8.W. the libel-law precludes our
friend’s “ trustworthy correspondent ” making
such statement on his own responsibility in the
press. We shall be glad to hear what Hanlan and
Hanlan’s backers have to say to all this. The
“trustworthy correspondent” says, among other
things, that he doubts if there was £10 000 laid out
in all the colony on Beach, who was backed mostly
for half-crowns. “ There is accordingly no sug-
gestion that the race was sold for the sake of the
market on this occasion. But, then, there is an-
other match to come on. * Had Hanlan any idea of
losing this one in order to get people to plank
their money down next time V' That is the ques-
tion everyone is asking. There is no doubt Beach
will be backed next time to any amount, and If
that is Hanlan’s game he could make it pay.”
And so on. Bosh I

in, and concussion of the brain. The dear little
boy escaped Two children, Lotto and Lilo, have
been giving exhibitions of trick-riding. They are
averred to be respectively four and five years old.
Lotto, facing backward, rode the bicycle forward;
seated ordinary way, he carried his sister round
standing on his shoulders; taking off the handle,
rode round as easily as with it; he jumped into the
saddle with the machine stationary, and balanced
without stirring it In January, 1883, there was
but; one cyclist in Moscow (Russia) now they
are not fewer than sixty, who have a club.
Most ride the “Russian Club,” a machine made spe-
cially for Russia by the Coventry Co. This year
the first bicycle races seen at Moscow drew 20,000
spectators The London Cyclist says : “ An
eminent surgeon in Sydney has put down the
rheumatism prevalent in Australia solely to the
pernicious effects of tea-drinking, which prevails
so largely.” We could “put down” that eminent
doctor in a short word of three letters, an’ we
likcd....F. de Clvry, champion of France, nearly-
killed by a woman crossing his bike while at full
speed. Cut all over Dr. w. B. Richardson, health
oracle, says: “ The tricycle is becoming quite a
common prescription with me ” An American
judge non-suited an injured cyclist In Courtonthe
peculiar ground that Sunday being a dies non, the
cyclist could not claim for damages inflicted on
that day Many English raop committees are in
the habit of giving prizes for trick riding.
Racing men frown on it as infra dig. but
it draws the bawbees. Slow races, however, are
nearly obsolete.. .Lord Coleridge lately decided
that a cyclist had a claim against a Tramway Co.
for accident caused by their rails not being “level
with the road.” At Moody and Sankey meetings
a man was specially appointed to look after
cyclists’ machines. What would it profit a man if
he gained salvation and lost his bicycle ?—Street-
riding is almost impossible in Berlin; so many
streets are interdicted by the authorities — At
the Isle of Man, a bicyclist tried if he could ride
close to the edge of the pier without tumbling
over on the rocks below. He found he couldn’t,
and died A small fox teirier who ran out to
bark at a machine got caught by the wheel and
jammed in the fork. He didn’t bark any more.
But the cyclist was “barked.” A London
bobby said ho considered the prisoner had no
right to ride in the street “because he was
an amateur.” On being interrogated, Robert
defined an “amateur” as “one who is learning to
ride.” A magistrate, where the defendant had
ridden down a bicyclist, said he would inflict a
heavy fine just to remind such drivers that the
streets were not made for the sole use of those
who could afford to drive carriages or cabs. All
had an equal right to the road For the Philadel-
phia 35-mlle race, the first prize was a plate worth
£150. Entries, £2 each. The three days’ meetings
were continued at night by electric light. Total
prizes valued £1000 Two novel races in England
were—one, a mile race in which the winner was
the man who did it in nearest time to 3min. 25sec.,
and the other, a race whore the bell was rung
exactly at half an hour, and the man then ahead
won At a large gathering at Leipslo, the cham-
pionship of Germany, OMmiles, was won by Jul.

Woman Items
Wives are presumptuous creatures. They
are always asking for a lock of their lover’s hair
before marriage, and taking it without asking
afterwards.
The Paris Baby Show was prohibited, ac-
cording to the bachelors, because the mere hold-
ing of it was calculated to seriously reduce the
marriage-rate. No man could help registering a
vow of celibacy in the presence of 20U0 babies.
It was a case of May and December; and,
talking generally about divorces. Mrs. May was
asked her opinion of it. Without hesitation she
replied, “ An unhappy compromise for a state of
things which can only be cured by widowhood.”
Doctor: “You see, wifey dear, I have
pulled my patient through, after all.” His wife:
Yes, dear; but then you are so clever. Ah! if I
had only known you five years earlier, I feel cer-
tain my first husband—my poor Thomas—would
have been saved!”
Queen Elizabeth of Roumania writes:—
“ If one forgives one loves no longer, for true love
knows nothing of forgiveness.” “ The jealousy of
those who love us is the grandest flattery.” “ Man
and wife should never cease to do a little courting,
no matter how old they may be.”
‘•Ah, Miss de Smythe, did you enjoy your-
self in the mountains ?” •* Oh, yes, I had a most
delightful time.” “ What have you done all the
summer to amuse yourself ?” “ Well, I have been
painting most of the time." “ Yes, I can see that;
but I mean what else?” And then, somehow or
other, a polar wave seemed to strike both of them.
“ George,” she said, as he assisted her from
the buggy, “ the next time you take me out riding
in the evening, I wish you would drive a less
spirited horse.” “Why, my dear?” he replied;
“ there isn’t the slightest danger with this horse. I
can hold him easily.” “ Oh, I suppose you can
hold him; but you have to vse both hands, you
know!”
The Bishop of Oxford, speaking at a con-
ference of clergy and laity, said the most impor-
tant question now before the English people wts
that relating to marriage with a deceased wife s
sister. With Lord Hatherley he would prefer the
landing of a French army at Dover to the passing of
that measure, for the army could be got rid of,
but, onoo passed, the Act legalising those mar-
riages could never be repealed.
“I wish to look at some mourning goods,”
said a lady, as she entered a linendraper’s shop.
“ Yes, madame,” replied the assistant; “this way,
please.” After looking through the entire stock,
she remarked that she would come in again in the
course of a day or two. “May I ask,” said the
assistant in a sympathetic tone of voice, “ if the
death occurred in your Immediate family ?”
“ There has been no death yet,” she replied sadly,
“ but my husband is very low.”
A young man who had become passion-
ately enamoured of an aged woman, besought htr
hand in marriage. But this she resolutely refused
on the ground that she had promised never to wed
without her parents’ consent. This it was now im-
possible to obtain, since they had both been dead
for several years, and the young man was forced
to console himself by running away with a plump
young creature of eighteen, whone parents were
not only living, hut energetically protesting. This
fable shows that the notion of “duty to one’s
parents ” is not altogether an absurd one. It may
be occasionally and advantageously objected to an
unpalatable scheme.
You never meet a fashionable woman in
the street without something in her hands. Not
one woman in fifty can carry a pair of empty
hands successfully. They may be small and neatly
gloved, put if there’s nothing to carry the fashion-
able woman fancies they feel as large as a pair of
hams. In this peculiarity the woman is like the
dude: if you take his cigarette from one hand and
his cane from the other, the dude is helpless. The
woman who carries her unoccupied hands down
the promenade is likely to get an insight into the
mysteries of hopeless confusion. The young lady
who carries a roll of music to disguise a pair of
idle hands is very numerous. The library book on
two straps is also extensively used.
She, having been tempted to go a muokre
in silk stockings, had run up a veryTarge bill, tor
which John, the mercer, was dally pressing her.
She, not wishing to let her husband know of her
extravagance, kept putting the vendor of leg-
ulsters off, until, goaded beyond endurance by his
importunities, she told him to send in the bill to
her spouse. All that night she slept not, and when
the morning meal she did attend, it was with
trembling limbs and a mind full sore perplexed.
But when she saw him open the letter and heard
him exclaim, “Hose, £25! Why the devil couldn't
the gardener have let me know before ? I thought
the plants were looking bad 1 ” Then a great glad
look came into her tawny eyes, and the birds
hushed their song in envy as her pure young
voice filled the morning air.
A French couple who had been married
ten years applied tor a divorce. “ Have you any
children ?” inquired the Judge. “ Certainly, your
worship!” “How many?” “Three: two boys
and a girl, and that’s why we have come to you.
Madame wants to keep two, and so do II” “ Will
you abide by my decision ?’’ asked the judge.
“Out, Monsieur!” they exclaimed. “Well, then,
you will both wait till you have a fourth child.
Then there will be two for each of you, and I will
decide bow they are te be allotted.” The couple
agreed, and the judge heard nothing further from
them. At length he met the husband. " Eh bien,
Monsieur! How are you getting on ?” "Ah, Mon-
sieur le Juge, a separation is for the present out
of the question.” “ How is that ?” “ We have got
five children now!” “Ah, then, we’ll wait a bit
longer,” remarked the judge.
The Lancet relates that a young girl “ of
an Idiotic type ” has died in the asylum at Ham-
burg, who possessed the peculiar gift of changing
the colour of her hair, according to the state of
her mind. In “ periods of sedateness ” her hair
was of its natural dull colour; when she was ex-
cited it became reddish; and her idiotic fits were
Indicated by a blonde colour. Three days were
generally required for the change to be completed,
and her complexion also varied in the same periods
and in the same direction. Altogether, we have in
this young girl “of an Idiotic type” the true
origin of the girl of the period, who, as is well-
known, takes about three days to change the
colour of her hair satisfactorily, and doctors her
complexion accordingly. When sheer idiocy pre-
vails in the mind, the colour most affected is the
yellow tint of a haystack.
Thus a French writerWomen like to
marry prosperous men, to hang upon them, prey
on them, and take their turn oui of them. They
may be good to their marital hankers, but they
hardly ever love tnem. Ask any Catholic priest
who nas obtained through the confessional deep
insight into the feminine heart, and you will find
that he will bear out what I now tell you. I be-
lieve this is why Mother Church is so indulgent to
fair sinners. The Czarina not long ago said to a
lady from whom I have it: ‘I am thankful to the
Nihilists for ono thing. They have made me love
my husband dearly. Our home-life has become so
different since I began to look upon him as though
he were under sentence of death. You can't think
how deeply his menaced state attaches me to
him.’”

Ladies hardly knew how to attire them-
selves for Saturday’s cricket match. The summer
time dictates light toilets, but the gloomy sky
threatened danger to all dainty fabrics, and no one
could guess to a moment when the rain might
come For this reason there was no uniformity in
the first summer show. Almost every variety of
dress conceivable was seen. And even then, num-
bars were never seen at all. So great was the
crowd that a seat would not be lightly given up
for the privilege of scintillating on the lawn. It s
oossiblv wearisome to sit for tour hours, but It is
certainly more so to stand. All round the ground
outside the pavilion there was a dense black mass
of spectators. Inside the half-crown haven, one
deep Ttu dress was remarkable. It was entirely ol
the one colour, cloth , ed * e fl d t i hickl L w iJ?
fur, satin underskirt, and a'l close-fitting. As the
very antithesis of this, was a white grass cloth
dress, which compelled notice by its enormous
distension. Yet it was symmetrical, and in quiet

elbow, tiny black bonnet and parasol. A third
prominent dress was all of brlaht gamboge green,
combining cashmere and satin, with large ruches
of the latter round the skirt bottom, and small
Snnnnt to corrrespond. Whether intentionally or
not, fwo ladies appeared in light India muslin
dresses of precisely the yellow hue Be ®"i n at
wickets, lace trimming matched: and as they
were well made, none looked much nicer. A
married lady's dress was extremely pretty :
black satin polonaise artistically piped with
brlaht crimson, the skirt alternate stripes of
black and crimson satin, caught up with buckles;
a delightful little bonnet just matched, and bore a
irlcnminBf crimson feather. Another married lady
wore™a cambric all of black and white stripes,
about an inch wide; although plain, it was most
(tastefully so, and the only decking was a little
■bouquet of violets on the bonnet. This alternate
wtripe device seemed very popular, instance,
an excellent toilet was a dark-brown cloth
bodice, pointed and tabbed, draped with apron-
shanod folds in front; while the waterfall back
was in long, very narrow pleats, which opened out
disclose alternate streaks of vivid apricot, p as-
toon of same. It was all rather gracefully carried,
too A young lady wore a neat costume of corn-
flower bTue, ottoman cord top and veillnv below;
and another very commendable costume was of
brownish grey cloth-a Mother Hubbard-tiny
pointed bodice, the skirt with a very broad band
of analogous coloured silk, and the small hat

honnuet at the waist; another by half a dozen
very small pleats down the back o f bodio . e '
worn with a white lace postboy hat, a third with
rubv belt and ruby velvet bonnet; while a golden
belt and golden basket bonnet looked charming
on a fourth. It seems the white is made to endure
all kinds of treatment, according to womens
whims. A Jewish lady displayed a pretty bis-
pult-ooloured silk, hung with white lace; and a
Tndire ‘ escorted the owner of a natty brown
dress 8 in summer cloth, under a brown
hat and feather. There was a maroon surah

with deep red bonnet—really in faultless taste. A

of dpst and flies, and its seven-

minrtoRof dudes-they don’t seem bo have strength
nr enough to get out of the way. It’s an
trial to a girl In a picnic dress to pass through
STat dust However, there’s an Eden at the end of
S2 lou?ney. It has been mostly created by Frank
ffl ndwhen the Produce men and their ladles
friends frolicked there on Thursday the place
was as btflght green and lovely as the eye of man
o vsters and amber beer—all innocent
the first thing, highly .'grateful
after the parching dust, and then while some went
round on the miniature tram or danced the sports
afiip fp(j their work, the athletes
away in the sun with herbic courage.
ThrJwdenl, which are particularly, prolific in
wliite lilies just now, were much patronised. Quoits
Coi n ed a number of married-looking gentlemen.
Children were provided with toys, and Kopff and
Austin's band played lor those who danced. At

siTnn irted bv the Mayor, Messrs. Merriman, Nelson,
Abigail 1 , Davison. See. Young, Palmer. Larkin, 4c.
a« the chairman announced that several distin-
guished^ vUitors“were anxious to get away,”
sneaking' was brief. The toast of ” Produce
Enta Anctloneers, and Merchants” was pro-
nosefi 1 by Mr?Abigai 1, and acknowledged by Messrs.
See S Procter, and Prescott. Mr. A. H. Prince
proposed the ” silver lining to our cloud of cares,
” It is they who are the real secret
of England’s greatness; it Is their smile that is
dear above everything else, and sought equally
bv nafnters, princes, aud produce merchants. Mr.
Prince then gracefully buried bis face In a bou-
a re8 t. Among the fair beings
whom Mr. P. so poetically extolled. Miss Purcell s
numL-llke figure was conspicuous and handsome
in purple attire of peculiar shade; Miss Coulter, in
nal P e strawberry pink percale, with canary plume
fa her hat, afao P looking very fine. A pretty
brocade polonaise of fungus brown, with brown
silk pleated underskirt was worn by Miss Solomon;
and a matronly lady In cream brilliant ana helio-
trope ribbons looked particularly nice. Miss Bond
wore white effectively trimmed with brown lace,
and Miss Fewings a dress of cafi au lait, veiling
and hat to suit, both frequently gracing the floor.
Miss Pointer, the best dancer there, also wore a
cnarming white, the perfection of a picnic toilet;
it was of lawn, with silver belt and necklace of
silvery shells, surmounted by a huge hat turned up
with white. Miss M‘Crae, a petite) maid, who seemed
quite effervescent with happiness, wore a maho-
gany brown cloth, and her No. 9 hat was turned
up with black. A hlonde in black satin also sup-
ported one of those monster straw wheels, with
its under edge lined with sorrow. A cocoa-
coloured cashmere trimmed with a broad band of
brown velvet, and brown gloves en mite, looked
well under a hat turned up with brown. Miss
Burrows was alluring in black silk and white lace,
and a hat that shielded a lovely complexion. A
smiling little attraction was Miss Munro, in white,
and her utter hat was also turned up with—oh, but
these hats get monotonous—it was not turned up
at all, but hung sadly down, oppressed with the
weight of cherries. Mrs John Booth wore black
satin; Mrs. S. Marsden, an exceedingly fine shot
silk of that delicate purple known as “fruit
bloom; 1 ’ and Mrs. C. Harrison was bright and popu-
lar in black and white. Dancing was kept up till
nearly six o’clock, and then all returned decor-
ously home, some in buggies and some in the
democratic tram.

A fairly enjoyable evening was spent by
the Petersham Owls and their friends in the local
Town Hall on the 19th instant. Miss Cooper played
tastefully one of Chopin’s pieces. Pippo sang “On
the Deck ” in good style; and the Misses Kennedy,
accompanied by Miss Ada Fairfax, sang “Queen
of the Sea” pleasingly. Woodpecker made his
first appearance in “Let me like a soldier fall,” and
suffered an encore. Mr, C.Teece recited “Wreck
of the Hesperus,” and, on returning to quieten
the noise he raised, gave “ Pa's Letter.” Miss
Sheridan-Reed sang “OhI hear the wild winds
blow,” splendidly, and, for an encore, a new song
called “ A.E.I.,” which became popular directly.
Mr. Ward favoured the Owls with “An Alpine
Storm," and the president announced that it
would be his last appearance. He also gave
“ Lullaby,” and his splendid voice will be much
lost at the future hoots. Miss Wood played
a piano solo on the “Carnival of Venice;” and
a nice voiced youth sang “ We have been glad to-
gether.” Being encored, he changed the glad to
sad. Encores are becoming so common that it
will probably soon be a desirable distinction not to
have one. Considering the entirely reasonless
way in which audiences persist in recalling singers
to the stage, it is quite open to suspicion that the
singer is frequently called back just to see if he
can do any better. Mr. Blocombe’s recitation,
“ M’Lean’s Address,” was given naturally, but was
too, too harrowing. While ladles went down for
refreshments, chairs were moved for a dance.
Two sisters, of Petersham, wore plain white lawn
dresses, tucked, with low necks and short sleeves,
and their fresh, bright faces well became such
pretty toilets. Another nicely made white dress,
trimmed with lace and pink ribbons, was worn by
a local lady. Airy and pretty was a cream dress
with red ribbons, worn by a brunette; and a
married lady of Petersham had a black satin de
lyon, with beautiful lace skirt. A Double Bay
lady looked neat and stylish In simple cream India
muslin, with blue sash and bow. A crushed straw-
berry silk and a cream satin dress were pretty,
also a violet velvet hody and heliotrope silk skirt.
Several ladies and gentlemen obligingly presided
at the piano.
* ♦ •
Some of the dresses at Madame Charbon-
net-Kellermann’s concert were far too nice to be
Eassed over unnoticed. Madame’s was of that
eavenly blue which becomes her so well, neither
too pale nor too deep. The material was of some-
thing soft, with striped satin draperies relieved by
white lace. Madame Merz wore blue also, almost
entirely covered with black Spanish lace, very
tasteful. Signora Fabrls wore her favourite
colour, cardinal, and looked very handsome. Mrs.
Spencer, a black dress, with extremely rich white
lace flounces, and cardinal flowers adorning the
corsage. One of the pupils, in a creamy slik
gauze, sam colour, was a delightful object for
j,d miring eyes. Another (one of the best pianists)
in pure white, was equally charming. Miss Gouet
wore a ruby velvet basque over a pink skirt, which
became her well. In the hall there was a white
ballet skirt, with dark green velvet short basque-
very quaint and very nice. Mrs. Wyatt’s dress was
a deep violet nun’s veiling skirt, with black velvet
bodice, meed in front with white silk cord. Miss
Guerney wore black, cut half low, and beautiful
natural flowers fastened on one shoulder. Miss
Carey’s dress of rich blue satin had waist-
band and bows of deep cardinal satin — a
charming contrast. Little Elsie Hall, in her
spotted muslin, and with two tiny kid shoes
tucked in the rung of her chair, was a wonder, and
several opera-glasses were kept intently levelled
at the wee, wee fingers which made such pretty,
and so admirably correct, music. Everyone thought
that Miss La Fontaine (is that the name ?) was de-
liciously pretty among the bevy of Signora Fabrls’
pupils: and everyone agreed that Madame Keller-
maun thoroughly deserved the beautiful bouquets
that were showered on her, and admired the art-
less way in which—quite accidentally—the best of
all, with the long tri-colour streamers of la belle
France, was left so prominently in view on the
piano. But we wish this bouquet business could
be reformed. Of course, it is ruthless to hurl tne
beautiful flowers on the stage; and yet It looks so
formal to hand them carefully up. It looks more
like cold preparation than spontaneous admira-
tion, and as if people were determined to throw
them, irrespective of the performer’s merit. But
by inviting attention to an excellent article on this
very subject by Locksley in last week’s Austral-
asian, we can save ourselves from saying any-
thing more than that if ever a predetermination
to hurl a bouquet would be justifiable, it would be
when Madame Charbonnet-Kellermann takes her
seat at the piano. A handsome amber satin dress
covered with black Spanish lace, looked excellent
on a tall form; Mrs. B. Burdekln wore a handsome
but quiet costume of lavender brocade; and one of
the most stylish and fashionable costumes there
was a theatre bodice of terra-cotta veiling and sash
of same; the vest front was of light pink, and so
was the sashed skirt, the whole effect being splen-
dld’
On Wednesday, 19th inst., Lady Augustus
Loftus gave a numerously attended “at home.”
About 300 guests representing the beauty and
fashion of Sydney were present. During the
evening, Mr. Fleming Norton appeared in some of
his character sketches with much success; and,
later on, the audience were thrilled by the exqui-
site playing of Herr Remenyl. Intense silence
pervaded the rooms as the pathetic strains of the
old, but ever sweet, “Last Rose of Summer”
floated through the air, and a burst of applause,
such as is seldom heard in those State apartments,
voiced the appreciation of his listeners as the last
whisper died away. After an interval for supper,
dancing commenced, and some three or four
waltzes were managed before the entertainment
concluded, shortly before one o’clock. There was
a most brilliant display of elegant toilettes on the
part of the fairer portion of the company, Lady
Augustus wore a handsome cardinal satin, with
train ; Mrs. Barry, a black costume; Mrs.
Speaker Barton was attired in a stylish cream
satin: Mrs. John Smith, white beaded satin;
Mrs. Moriarty, a long-trained cream brocho and
pale pink; the Mayoress, an elaborate flowered
silk: Mrs. C. J. Roberts, cream satin; Mrs. Bou-
verie, a white dress; and Mrs. Le Patourel, cream.
Miss Stephen was in black net, Miss Parkes in
cream satin and pink broche; Miss Robertson
wore a beautiful white satin ornamented with
pearls and lace flounces; Miss Q. Eagar, white
spotted net with bertha of scarlet flowers; Miss
Constable, a tasteful combination of London
smoke; Miss Manning, a cloudy brown net of
delicate hue harmonising with her hair. Mrs.
Palmer looked well in black. Mias Salamons
affected a peculiar pale mouse-coloured lace dress;
and Miss Halloran wore a beautiful drees of white
satin and net, t*ie front of the skirt of satin was
embroidere i with large lilies worked in graduated
pearls, and the body, which was of white satin,
perfectly plain—except a bust bouquet of
white chrysanthemums — was noticeable tor
being cut in a very deep narrow shield-
shaped opening; it was sleeveless, being only
held by narrow straps and pearl ornaments
over very shapely arms. Mrs. Bingham Perens
wore a dress of black lace over salmon silk, with
gold and silver birds; while her sister, Miss Leila
Halloran, wore a black costume, and wore it well.
Among the guests were Mr. H. Halloran, C.M.G.,
Sir Alfred and Lady Stephen, officers of the
American corvette and the N.S.W. Permanent
Force, Sir James and Lady Martin, Bishop and
Mrs. Barry, &c. Miss Dlbbs (daughter of the
Colonial Treasurer) wore black net and cardinal,
and Miss Forbes a lovely pale-green silk. * Miss B.
B. Smith was attired in light blue, and Miss Gore
was pretty in an uncommon costume of orange
yellow, relieved with lace. Skirts were all very
much extended, and crinolines the rule—with very
few exceptions. Net dresses in all shades, with
waterfall backs, seemed popular and in good style.
They are likely to continue so during the Summer
* * *
Though it is well known by the general
public, few men care to say openly, that many
fancy fairs are conducted in a very questionable
manner. There are sundry items in the way of
expenses into which it does not do to enquire too
closely, and tradesmen who lend or supply goods
sometimes find a charity bazaar very profitable.
Even if a scheme be protected by the magic label
of “Charity,” that is no reason why inquiry into
its working should be either bluffed or hushed. It
is not only that raffles, art-unions, and share-lists
are often merely synonymous with systematised
extortion; but the unpleasant suspicion so fre-
quently Ungers that even when the money has
been wrung from the visitor it may not all go
where it is supposed to go, after all. There is
no satisfactory check. Raffle lists contain
quite an indefinite number of names; and as
shillings and half-crowns tumble into the pockets
of young girls, there is the vaguest uncertainty as
to whether the coins ever actually represent a
“ chance ” in anything. At not one bazaar in fifty
are the names of winners advertised, and these are
precisely what the contributors have a claim to
know. Half-grown children pertly travel round,
selling bouquets and boxes of cigarettes, and it
rests with themselves how they balance their
finances. This is putting an unwise strain on
young people’s integrity. Even were the stall-
holders confined to well-known people, it would
be different; but at nearly every bazaar there are
clouds of assistants who volunteer their aid, and
bustle round for one or two nights in the most
delightfully Independent way; and there is nothing
to give assurance of the fact that they are respon-
sible persons. Frankly, is this state of things de-
sirable ? It is a matter to which a newspaper has a
fair right to call attention. And if the inference
from these remarks seems to be an ungenerous
one, the onus rests on those who permltlthe fault,
not on those who merely notice it.

An entertainment of triple attraction was
performed in the new Masonic Hall on Monday.
First was a brief concert —a Beethoven sonata, by
Misses Woolley and Pedley, a dainty ditty of Blu-
menthal’s by Mrs. Berrie Drlnan, and Mr. W.
Street sang distinctly and carefully “The Valley.
Miss Pedley finished with Pinsutl’s Heaven and
Earth ” The second attraction was Schumann s
cantata “The Pilgrimage of the Rose,’ a poem
full of delicate fancy, with a deal of recita-
tive in the music, but containing several beau-
tiful melodies. The third consisted of Mrs. John
Smith’s tableaux vivants, which silently illustrated
the cantata as the singers unfolded its story.
Briefly, it is this: In thejfairy regions, the'Rose-
child longs to taste the delights of mortal love,
and the first tableau shows her seated apart from
the rest of a group of fairies. The part was taken
by Miss Enid Macarthur, all in cloudy white, and
with her fair face resting pensively on the hand,
and turned towards the audience full of the
beauty of maiden wistfulness, while the light
was thrown on her light hair rippling down
—there was a general buzz of admiration.
Her wish is granted, and the next tableau
shows Lady Innes as the Fairy Queen in
the centre of the group beading down and giving
the Hose-child a rose, as a charm to carry in
her pilgrimage on earth. Thenceforth she is a
mortal, Rosa. Tableaux show her interview with
the cottager Martha (Miss Macarthur) and the
Grave-digger (Mr. Floyd); and in the fifth, the
Miller and his wife (Mr. O. B. Labertouobe and Mrs.
John Smith) are mourning the death of their
daughter. This was very beautifully pictured.
Then the Grave-digger enters leading Rosa, and
their grief vanishing, they adopt the lovely Rose-
child as their own. The change from grief to
happiness was cleverly shown in the radiant look
of the Miller’s wife—its effect being heightened by
the lime-light thrown upon her face. The next
scenes showthe Ranger (Mr. JustinM Carthy) woo-
ing her, and the wedding festivities. Finally, a
year having flown, the Rose-maiden has a bud of
her own to kiss; and thus, having reached the
height of mortal bliss, she resigns to the babe her
rose, and is borne back to her fairy compeers
above, in the closing tableau. Each time the cur-
tain fell, the singing proceeded. After the two
tenor reciters (Messrs. W. B. Scott and W. G.
Walker), the burden of the soloing was sustained
by Mrs. Gerald Richardson as Rosa, the I airy
Queen being daintily taken by Miss J. Brenan.
There was a large chorus from St. Cecilias
choir. In the tableaux, the cynosure of ad-
miration was certainly the rose-maiden, first
in her gossamer garb as a fairy, and afterwards on
earth in a flowing robe of white, edged with
classic border of blue lines. In most of them, the
curtain had to be raised two or three times, and
even the spectators were hardly satisfied, the
scenes were so attractively arranged. The audi-
eoce was a very fashionable one, including a
party from Government House and Bishopscourt.
Lady Loftus wore a handsome, dark-brown satin,
trained, with beaded trimming; Miss Constable, a
simple dotted muslin, of pale straw-tint; Miss
Windeyer, cream satin and tulle ; Mrs, Bayly, a
rich black dress; Miss Woolley (who acted as
accompanist) black satin and lace set off with old
gold; Miss Pedley, a rich brocade of dawn pink,
with pink rose garland, and white satin skirt; Miss
J. Brenan, a pretty pink veiling bodice and dra-
pery, and dotted net white skirt over pink, bou-
quet, and white elhow gloves. A unique dress,
more conspicuous than anything in the hall, was of
soft material, prettily made, all of that extremely
brilliant colour, sang-de-bceuf. A pale blue India
muslin, heavily hung with ficelle lace, was grace-
fully worn by a tall, auburn-haired lady, well-
anown in society; and another rich costume was
bodice of brightest crimson velvet, decked with
gold jewellery, and satin skirt to match, worn by a
lady whose gleaming light-brown hair was heaped
together in large crested curls. A culr brown
satin stylishly made and looped with crimson cord
was also brilliant, and the wearer had suited her-
self well.

On Thursday, the Iroquois officers enter-
tained a number of guests on board their vessel
The decks, which are very spacious, were pre-
pared for dancing, and a melodious string band
provided. Guests began to arrive early In the
atternoon, and they included tue Mayor of Sydney
and wife, the American Consul and daughter,
Captain and Miss Dearborn, officers of the Miranda
and Wolverene, Captain and Mrs. Broomfield, Lady
Manning, Mr. Hanlan, and the well-known faces of
those pleasure-hunting members of Sydney society
who never miss such affairs. In spite of a sultry
afternoon, dancing was well kept up, and flowers
in profusion and dainty refreshments added a zest
to the scene. Captain Yates Stirling played the
host most genially, and one interesting incident
was the presentation, by Miss Kahlo s hands, on
behalf of the crew of the Iroquois, of a Jewel suite
to the great oarsman, Hanlan. .Most of the' Com-
pany were landed again by the boats in the dusk.

Rip Van Winkle was a grand old fellow,
but he slept too long. The legendary Dutchman
slumbered and slumbered, and, when he did wake,
the golden opportunities of life had gone, and
everything he laid his hands to crumbled into use-
less dust. The village maidens jeered at him, and
his ancient cronies laughed him to scorn. It is
just as well that people should know how unneces-
sary it is to close the eyes to be perfectly somno-
lescent, for, as a matter of fact, there are many
walking about in this 10th century practically as
sound asleep as if they were packed “this side up”
ready for the old-fashioned family vault or the
new-fangled cemetery. There is one thing—we
are not a very sleepy lot in this colony; there is a
good deal of “tall talk,” Yankee fashion, but
there are a good many “ tall ” things done also.
There is the city railway, also the great water
scheme, which for years past have bem the sub-
ject of “ tell ” talk, and, so far, they are nothing
but talk; but, for big, useful deeds, there is

dancers. The Masonic Hall was decorated, and at
4 o’clock things presented a very lively appear-
ance, all the young adies being prettily dressed,
some in fancy attire. Master G. Pender wore
Scotch kilts. Masters Morson were in sailor suits,
and their costume set off their dancing. Mesdames
Gillies, Adams, and Rourke were judges. The
contest was close, and ultimately resulted as fol-
lows:— Waltzing, Miss Fitzpatrick 1, Miss Alicia
Sparke 2; step-dancing, Walter Morson, silver
medal; ballroom dancing, Master Pender; thus
showing that each style received attention, each
being useful in its way. The Mayor, Mr. Robert

during the afternoon. A special prize was given
to Miss Lucy Lee, at the request or the Judges, for
correctness of time and waltzing. Altogether, the
affair was pleasant. Interesting, and likely to prove
very instructive.

hibition) December 9.

Industrial Exhibition opens December 15.
Sydney, Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,— One of the most brilliant
concerts of the season was given by Madame Char-
bonnet-Kellermann last Wednesday night in the
Protestant Hall. I expect when Madame’s banker
entered the three figures to her credit the day
after the concert, he thought to himself “who
wouldn’t be a charming pianist?’’ And, indeed,
who wouldn’t, if they could; but that’s just it—i/
they could ? Without a Charbonnet’s musical talent
and aptitude, a lifetime of hard practice couldn’t
accomplish It; on the other hand, talent without
work is just as useless. By combining the two,
Madame is what she is, and that is something so
good that when she gives her annual concert she
is always honoured by ns brilliant an audience as
greeted her the other night. Heller’s transcription
of the “ Desert ” was her first solo, and it was a
happy choice, bringing back to our minds as it did
reminiscences of one of the most successful of our
Liedertafel concerts, when they delighted us by
their rendition of this beautiful work. All that
can be said of Madame’s playing of this solo is that
she fairly excelled herself, and was rapturously
encored, and bouquets actually rained upon her—
that is, If bouquets can rain; but, at all events,
they were showered upon her, and her trouble
was how she should carry such a load of beau-
tiful tokens of admiration. But she managed
it, as she does everything else, with a delight-
ful and piquant grace quite peculiar to her-
delf. For an encore she played Chopin’s beautiful
plaintive waltz (I am sure Chopin must have been
sobbing all the time he was writing that waltz) in
A minor. Her own brilliant “ Myosoli ” waltz
was her next solo, and I think I told you before
that it is a composition to be proud of. It is to be
published shortly, but, as it abounds in difficulties
which cannot be overcome by an ordinary per-,
former, It will be considerably simplified in the
published form. And, now, it Is no ridiculous
’gush” when I tell you that I never in all my
life heard such a wonderful performer for her age
as little Elsie Stanley Hall. Ernest Hutchinson,
the Australian Mozart, is clever—very clever-but
little Elsie is some years younger than he was
when he performed in Sydney, and yet her solo
the other night (Mozart’s “Sonaia in A”) was
more difficult than any he attempted at that time.
Her accompaniment to young Tom Traill’s oboe
solo was equally astonishing. I heard some one
say, “ How Madame must have drilled her in that
accompaniment!’’ but I had it from Madame her-
self, dear, that the child read it at sight perfectly
and required no drilling whatever. Indeed, her
reading at sight is marvellous for such a baby.
The youthful oboist and infant pianist well de-
served all the praise that was bestowed upon them:
for Just think, dear, how the little mites must
nave worked to attain in so few years the
■skill they possess — for, even talented as
they are, they must have spent many a weary
hqur, and perhaps shed many bitter tears,
■over'triplets, syncopated time, &o. I remember
■Once reading an anecdote of Mozart's child life,
which was as follows:—One day he had been play-
“Ug to a party of children, when a little vlrl went
«P to him, and, with a big sigh of admiration,
J Uped, “Tell me, pretty boy, how Is it you can
■make such beautiful music? Is it born in your
eager a ?’’ The “pretty boy ” shook his bead, and
replied, “Oh, no I I have great trouble to make
my fingers do as I want them; I try until I get
tired, then rest, and then again I practice them,
till I grow very weary; and again, and again, until
at last I am able to make the music which pleases
you so." And yet I have known more than one
fairly talented musician in Sydney make it their
boastithat they never found it necessary to prac-
tice more than an hour a day; but I think you will
nearly always find that these talented ones are but
skin de«p, and it is only a genius who finds it
necessary to labour in striving for the perfection
which alone can satisfy the superior mind. But
here I am forgetting all about the concert. Where
was I ? Oh, I remember—with the children, and I
think I have stayed with them quite long enough
now; so, good-bye, little ones. It doesn’t
seem possible to give a concert without Mons.
de Willlmoff, ana, if it wasn’t that he was
such a delicious performer, I should be quite tired
of writing his name. I am glad others agree with
me about his playing; but, at the same time, there
isn’t half tne satisfaction in saying a good word
for him when ho is such an universal favourite.
Still, I must be honest, and tell you that he received
such a decided encore for his solo that he was com-
pelled to give another; and his obligato to Mrs.
Spencer’s “Alla Stella” (which she sang very
sweetly) was just what it should be. But Mr.
Cooper I Oh, Mr. Cooper 1 It wasn’t his fault, I
know, for the piano was not tuned to his proper
pitch; and then, again, he was bothered for want
of a stand, which altogether put him out—and no
wonder. Now, if I told you that he played his
clarionet solo as well as he can play it under more
favourable conditions, I should not be truthful,
and should deserve your utmost contempt; there-
fore, although it breaks my heart to write it, I am
compelled to own that it was decidedly below his
usual performances. He knew it himself, too, so
I expect he would be rather surprised when he saw
in the papers that he had played splendidly, or
something to that effect. I know if I were
he I shouldn't beihalf pleased to have the hundreds
of people who were present led to believe that
that was the best I could do. It’s well meaning of
the papers, no doubt, but very stupid and unjust.
The ever welcome Fabris came in for her share of
flowers and recalls, and after singing “ Rataplan ”
with a chorus of her own pupils, chose “The Last
Watch ” for an encore. And Madame Merz, too, I
was nearly forgetting her, which wouid have been
quite too bad, for she sang very nicely Indeed.
The “ Hallelujah Chorus,” played on seven pianos,
by forty-two hands (how many fingers would there
be, dear ? there's a little sum for you to work out
in any idle moment), was so well received that the
whole twenty-one girls had to troop on to the plat-
form and go through it again. Miss Browne in a
piano and violin duet with Mons. de Will, (that’s
for short, dear), astonished us by her brilliant and
finished style of playing, and had not the concert
been considerably lengthened by reason of all the
encores demanded, we should have much liked to
have had her play again. The same may be said of
Mr. Harding's “My Queen,” which he sang with
passion, tenderness, sweetness, and all the rest.
And here endeth the Charbonnet-Kellermann
concert.
The fourth Yogrloh solrd muslcale was better
attended than usual; in fact, nearly all the front
seats were reserved, which was as it should be.
The opening quintette for two violins, viola, ’cello,
and clarionet was very enjoyable, the clarionet
(Mr. Cooper) being particularly prominent in doing
some good work. Madame vogrloh, who looked
extremely well in a biscuit-coloured silk dress,
with rich white lace trimmings, amber-beaded
necklet and bracelet, was hardly in her best voice,
but her second-best can scarcely be found fault
with, being, as it is, so far above an average
singer’s best efforts. Herr Vogrlch’s “ Rhapsodle ”
(Liszt) was a fine performance, and there were
other good things which I haven’t time to talk
about just now, so they must wait till next week;
but, you know, good things will always keep.
I do believe the Bita-Radcliffs are having such
good times in Brisbane, they can’t tear themselves
away. Of course all the papers speak of them In
very eulogistic terms, and, indeed, how could they
do else? I suppose they will be picnicked and
champagne-suppered to their hearts’ content, if
not more. Oh I what merry lives these first-class
artists lead, to be sure! And there is Grattan
Riggs going to leave us now (excuse the blot, dear,
’tWas only a tear). He is to have a benefit on Fri-
day night, and, of course, we are all going, for
Goodness knows when we shall see his like again.
You remember, dear, when the two Thornton
girls left school to go to the Continent to finish,
how timid they were at the idea of a Continental
school, whore, as you know, we were always led to
believe the girls were so ladylike, graceful, and
clever ? Well, I heard from one of them the other
day, and she tells me that far from being behind
the Continental misses in general information,
music, and dancing, they find they have not half
the difficulty in holding their own as they had
here; and as for graceful girls, they are not to be
compared to the Australians. Fancy that! They
are, as a rule, better read, and in painting they
beat us, but that's all. How vexing to think that
all the time when wo were being worried into the
belief that we were intolerable dunces, that we
weren’t so bad after all ! And our calisthenic
master, toot how he bothered us about our limp
attitudes, and our standing at ease with a crease in
our sides, as he expressed it, and which, just to
frighten us, he used to declare would make us
grow as crooked as a mark of interrogation ?
Heighol though those were happy days, with no
dressmakers’ bills (at least, we weren’t troubled
with them) and no lectures for flirting at the last
ball, we didn’t half know what good times we were
having, did we, dear ?
It strikes me, if I do not bring this letter to a
close, I shall have double postage to pay; and as I
am In an economical frame of mind (which I feel
bound to own is gompulsory, being tfle end of the
month, you know, dear), it would be inconvenient.
So, aadw.
Your loving
MAB.


A POPULAR MINSTREL MADE HAPPY;
OK, FROM JEST TO EARNEST.
“ For seven years,” writes Mr. Horace Bent, of
the Federal Minstrels, “ I have suffered from an
acute neuralgic affection of the right knee and
rheumatic gout, which became so severe during
our season at the 4 Gaiety ’ in September, ’83, that I
was obliged to relingulsh the active duties of my
profession and keep my room for a couple of days.
I had tried several strong liniments at various
times, some of which gave me partial relief. In
the course of my lecture and sketches I had fre-
quently mentioned, jocularly, St. Jacobs Oil; but
it never occurred to me to apply it to my own ail-
ments until a friend who happened to be in my
room whilst I was complaining of intense pain re-
minded me of its claims, and sent out for a bottle
right away. I used a little of it immediately, and
found instant re-let, repealing the application
again later on in the evening. From that night I
have never felt either the neuralgic affection of
the knee or the rheumatic gout return, and 1
would have sent you this acknowledgment earlier
but I thought it best to thoroughly establish the
permanence of the effect; and have to subscribe
myself a firm believer in the virtues of St. Jacobs
Oil.”

“German Syrup.”—No other medicine in
the world has ever given such a test of its cura-
tive qualities as Boschee’s German Syrup. In
three years two million four hundred thousand
small bottles of this medicine were distributed
free of charge by Druggists in the United States of
America to those afflicted with Consumption,
Asthma, Croup, severe Coughs, Pneumonia, and
other diseases of the throat and lungs, giving the
afflicted undeniable proof that German Syrup will
cure them. The result has been that Druggists in
every town and village in civilized countries are
recommending it to their customers. Go to your
Druggist and ask what they know about it. Sample
Bottles (id. Regular size, 3s. tid. Throe doses will
relieve any case.
Political Points
Stage direction by the Speaker: “ Exit
Parkes; enter Baker.”
Granville is to have a paper all to itself.
It is to be a nice, lively paper, and its proprietors
advertise that a resident reporter will be stationed
at Rookwood. At last there will be opposition to
the Shroud on its own ground.
The Land and Industrial Reform League
have returned Mr. Baker for Carcoar. Likc Oarn-
betta they recognise the value of opportunism in
politics. And opportunism has just been defined
as “doing ill yourself lest others should do it.”
The South Australian Legislative Council
“ kicked out ” tbe Payment of Members Bill. The
Bill provided for paying members of both Houses,
so that the Council cut off their own supplies. Dr.
Campbell was in favour of paying members of the
Lower House only.
A Doomsday Book has been for some years
in preparation by tbe Lands Department of New
Zealand. The Premier. Mr. Stout, has stated offi-
cially that th« first volume of the book is now
ready, price 30s. As the book does not give the
names |fof mortgagees of real property, and as
these are quite as plentiful in New Zealand as in
New South Wales, it is scarcely a reliable guide to
the practical owners of real estate.
In a speech of remarkable straightness
(toned down in the daily papers). Sir John Robert-
son has fixed his position as regards the new Land
Act. Replying to Mr. Dibbs, he said, generally,
“ It is a damnable falsehood. It is true I did my
damnedest (only he said damdist) to prevent the
BUI passing, but now it has passed, I’ll be damned
If I prevent the Government getting money
enough to carry out their measures.”
If we only wrote as rudely about politi-
cians here as they do in New York. Harper's
Weekly said of Mr. Blaine that certain letters
convicted him of deliberately telling a series of
JftUsehoods.” Well, now, there are a few gentle-
iften in public life here of whom it would be quite
truthful now and again to say tnat something con-
victed them of deliberate falsehood. But as the
Marchioness said to Mr. Swiveller, “ we dursn’t do
it.”
It was Captain Barry who in New Zealand
related the discovery of a vein of “lumbago” at
the Dunstan, and another time complained of
“plumbago ” in the back. In South Australia, Mr.
John Bray, M.P., is also a little astray In medical
terms. He lately hoped that the back-bone of the
Ministry was not “ infectious.” In New South
Waks, it is possible thatiDr. Ross will hope that
the Ministry’s want of back-bone is not “In-
fectious.”
Lord Henley, who poses as a Liberal, pro-
mised to attend a Franchise meeting at Northamp-
ton. But he then didn’t know what was in store
for him. The resolution he was announced to
support declared, among other things, that the
hereditary system in legislation is bad in principle,
wholly mischievous in nractice, and ought at once
to be abolished. This was too much for his lord-
ship, who did not attend the meeting, and wrote
to say he could not conscientiously do so.
The Government are supposed to have
under consideration the representation of New
South Waies at the approaching International
Inventions Exhibition. There are several national
inventions of New South Wales, so rare, in general,
that they would have to be exhibited in a glass by
themselves. Take M’Elbone and A. G. Taylor, for
Instance, as political inventions Nothing in the
world can touch them. David Buchanan would
like to be sent to England as an exhibit of “colo-
nial oratory,” but his style Is too common.'
Memo, for politicians: When asked why
he did not take a prominent part in public life, the
late Duke of Wellington used to answer, “ My
father’s thoughts were given up entirely to the
country, and the consequence was that he, whom
all the world may be said to have envied, was
often heard to say that there Is nothing in life
worth living for. I very early made up my mind
not to follow his example in that direction.” In
Australia, the politician doesn’t give himself up to
the country. The country gives itself up to the
politician.
The Cumberland Independent is a pretty
little paper for holding half pints of shrimps. As
a political organ, too, it has lofty views, that soar
beyond representative G ivernment. Thus it tells
us that Mr. Hugh Taylor placed £5000 on the esti-
mates of this session for Improving Parramatta.
Mr. Dibbs may be Colonial Treasurer and a man oi
some account in New South Wales (outside Parra-
matta), but in Parramatta they do not know him,
and Hugbey Taylor they do. No doubt the Inde-
pendent does It is a fine thing to be on the free
list at—oh, at anything.
Mr. Farnell has got all he can ask to enable
him to give the new Land Act a fair trial. De-
partments! estimates passed in a lump. Now the
only question is, “Can he (for it would be unfair
to doubt his will) prevent practical evasion of the
law in regard to improvement purchases and
dummy selections taken up before January 1st,
1885? That these things will be tried on, tnere is no
doubt. Many country land offices have had ap-
plications to purchase land conditionally put in in
swarms during the last four months. And this in
the Western district, where conditional purchase
is to cease after the end of 1884.
Here’s a splendid way of putting down a
parliamentary bore, suggested in a bill introduced
ny Mr. Fitzherhert In the New Zealand Parliament,
hut not passed. However, next session, in New
South Wales, some one may bo humai e enough to
get it adopted. The plan is this. Whenever a.
member is speaking and attention to the want of
a quorum has had to be twice called, the member
is not to be let continue his speech, and some one
else gets an innings. For ourselves, we should
like to see this thing tried here. It is a gentler
way than having a messenger go round with a
meat-axe and chop members who will talk when
they should not. And if it answers, we would
give up advocating the meat-axe.
Now that the financial session of the New
South Wales Parliament has commenced, members
will be glad to learn what bright and shining ex-
amples they are, compared to those in New Zea-
land. II seems that last session. In Maoriland,
there was “ open, scandalous drunkenness ’’ with-
in the walls of the Parliamentary buildings. At
least, that is what the New Zealand Times says,
and it ought to bt a fair judge in the matter. And
the drunkenness was not that of “clerks, police-
men, and messengers.” That could have been
soon remedied. But it was the legislators them-
selves who got drunk. How pleasant it is to know
that there is nothing of this kind in Macquarie-
street! No member of Parliament ever gets
drunk here, and Mr. Chief Messenger May bus now
included in his duties the periodical smelling of
the breaths of members of the Press, to see that
they do not go too far.
J. B. Patterson still glories in “ Black
Wednesday.” He claims for himself a not incon-
siderable share of the credit of crumbling to dust
tho arrogant Civil Service of Victoria, which, long
pampered by the Conservatives, could never bring
itself to treat the Radical party with anything but
contempt, or In any way to recognise the Berry
rigime as an enduring actuality. Patterson scorns
the pretence made by many weak-kneed persons
that the Black Wednesday dismissals were justified
by moral grouuds. The Ministry’s action, he says,
was only right as a bold political expedient—as a
grand coup d’etat, Napoleonic in its terror and
suddenness. In other words, its sole justification
was its success. The secret history of the Vic-
torian Revolution, from the pen of J.B.P. or of
Lalor (whose name, says Patterson, will be written
in letters of gold in the annals of the colony) would
he truly interesting. The diary of a man like
Peter Lalor, the present Victorian Speaker, extend-
ing from the troublous times of the Eureka Stock-
ade, where he stood in the .ran of the digger-rebels
and had his arm shot off, and had a price put on
his head, down to the fight with the land-mono-
polists, would be of unspeakable Interest to every
native of the colonies.
“Discussion,” says Macaulay in his toma-
hawking article on Barere, “ may safely be left
free by rulers who act on popular principles.
Tyranny may last through ages where discussion
is suppressed. But combine a press like that of
London with a Government like that of St. Peters-
burg, and the evitable effect will be an explosion
that will shake the world.” Liberty is dead in
Russia. It has been strangled by that race of
murderers, the Romanoffs. The Emperor and his
creatures have killed all the journals which they
could not debauch and prostitute. Since the pre-
sent Alexander's accession, eight newspapers have
been prohibited, including the Golds: only two
Liberal journals now exist, and they are in hourly
anticipation of their fate. Political discussion in
newspapers is altogether forbidden, and a graud
crusade has been directed against the raas-azines.
The Slovo, the Messenger oe Europe, and the
Annals oe the Country have all been sup-
pressed the latter was the greatest magazine
in Russia, with a circulation of 10,000 copies and
worth £130,000! The charge was “entertaining
subversive opinions;” the real offence was that of
discussing too closely the condition of the country.
An index of “ Books which may not he sold ” has
been issued. It composes 135 works, in 800 volumes,
and includes such books as Lyell’s “Antiquity of
Man,” Smith’s “ Wealth of Nations,” and Lub-
bock’s “ Primitive Civilisation.” All the works of
Stuart Mill, Bagehot and Herbert Spencer are
dtfendu, the Index having apparently been drawn
up by some priest who is au absolutist. As we
have already said, Piddlngtonaky, the bookseller,
who Impotently denounced The Bulletin in that
asylum of senile debility, our Legislative Council,
when we wrote concerning the fate of that blood-
thirsty bombed-up adulterer, the late Czar, should
now go to Russia and make his fortune. The
Hansard which contains his speech, would,
doubtless, serve as a sufficient introduction to the
tyrant he professes to admire. The day has al-
ready come when Sophie Perovskaya, the hang-
man’s victim, is placed by the civilised world on
the same pedestal with Charlotte Corday, the
heroine whose dagger, thrust into the heart of
Marat, avenged France and mankind.
• • •
The last new phrase for Mr. Gladstone’s
possible mode of putting the screw on is “ Water-
ing the Peerage.”. ..At an Athlone meeting, our
old friend, the sweet-tempered Mr. W. Redmond,
said that his presence in Athlone was due to the
act of a Dublin Englishman, “Jack, the Red Earl
Spencer.” .. .The Pope, who, at the instigation of
Mr Errington, not long ago denounced Parnell,
has now turned right about-face The democratic
party in tne R C. Church in Ireland have, there-
fore, carried the day. Since the Irish will not now
elect the Pope's M.P.’s, the Pope is compelled to
solicit the services of the M.P.’s whom the Irish
will elect... The Skye crofters’ agitation has as-
sumed what the Jewish organ, the London D.T.,
describes as “alarming dimensions.” At a recent
meeting, 60U of them pledged themselves to pay no
rent until their present rents have been reduced.
Each crofter agreed to contribute 10s. towards a
defence fund, should legal proceedings be taken.
It is stated that everyone present was compelled
by the leaders of the movement to agree to this,
under threat of having their property destroyed.
. .. The Skye Crofters declared they would pay no
more rent unless their grievances were attended
to. The Government told this to the Marines—600
of them.
TALE OF A TRAMP.
People who like to live for nothing should
be allowed to live on nothing. This is an aphorism.
It is a sample one. We can sell similar ones by the
gross or the hale to country editors and others. It
was suggested to us by the little plot of the two
tramps who presented themselves before the
Health Department, the other day. with the storv
that they had been drinking in Baird’s quaran-
tined public-house. They were vaccinated and
fired forth upon the street once more. What they
wanted, of course, was to be sent to the Quaran-
tine Station. The competition for existence must
be pretty sharp when men can be found who want
to make a living on pretence of having the small-
pox. But, after all, this is uot so had as a case
that came under our personal notice. You can,
therefore, rely upon reading the truth severe and
simple in what follows. One early morning we
were going through the Domain on our way to the
Fish Market to purchase fish. We did this fre-
quently at one time, when we were under the
hallucination that fish was good for the brain;
but, as we were also in the habit of exchanging
the fish on the way home for liquor of a quality
calculated to promote idiocy of a peculiarly debas-
ing character, we were finally led to the conclu-
sion that we were not making sufficient mental
progress to justify a continuation of the practice.
Let us linger over this old memory for a moment.
There is no harm in recalling it now. We have
given up fish-eating, and renounced rum. All we
take in these times in the way of a stimulant is
our little pint of liquefied brimstone in the morn-
ing, a trifling dozen glasses or so of naptha and
nicotine through the day, and a few petite verves
of vitriol and verdigris before going to bed. So
you see, we cannot be accused of encouraging in-
temperance, however we write. Well, as we said
before, we used to barter our fish to the barman.
Frequently one of the fish would he alive. This
one we would keep, and-it being our eccentricity
not to drink alone—“shout” for in the most im-
partial fashion. The consequence was that, when
received on our return with a freezing glare, we
would basely endeavour to cast the blame on the
fish, and, with feeble meanness, Insinuate that it
led us astray. And, as It would certainly by that
time present too degraded an appearance to be fit
to come to table, it would be promptly thrown out;
and the house cat would shortly after go away, and
come back several days subsequently in a dejected
stafe of mind with half her fur gone, one eye out,
and only a stump of her tail remaining. We must
have used up about two cats a week in those
times. But those times are gone, and we are re-
formed. There Is no reason, reader, why we
should not admit to you that we have often been
the prey of remorse for having sent so many mem-
bers of the dumb creation into inebriates graves.
Now we can return to our tramp. It was, as we
have previously intimated, early morning in the
Domain, and we were brushing the pearly now on
the grass as we tripped lightly along, when we
came across him, stretched out at full length under
a tree. The sun was just rising in rosy splendour
from the sea, and weaving slender golden gossa-
mers of light in the soft green foliage over his
head. He was blinking at it lazily, and probably
wondering in a drowsy way why it should be so
everlastingly foolish as to take the trouble to rise
when there was no policeman to rouse it. He was
certainly a picture of repose, and we paused to
look at him. The only signs he gave of being
aware of our scrutiny were a droop of the left eye-
lid and a slow elliptic movement of his tongue
around his lips. Finally we held up a shilling, and
softly whispering “rum,” watched for the effect.
A slow shudder shook his frame, he closed both
eyes, traced another ellipse with his tongue, and
then with one whirl was beside us. On the way to
the hotel he told us his story. We forget most of
it now, but we think he said that ho was a Univer-
sity man—Cambridge, we believe. The statement
was possibly true; his English was bad enough.
Also that he was sent out to Australia to dazzle
the natives and marry wealth and beauty. Ihen
the usual sliding-scale. Chief hotels, champagne,
carriage parties, bouquets, box at the Royal.
Second-class hotels, brandy, cabs, no bouquets,
pit stalls. Small restaurants, rum, tram, no
bouquets, occasional free pass. Boiler, rain-water,
rum at rare intervals, no tram, no bouquets, no
free passes, no anything but requests to move
on.” Could not work. Was too delicate to work.
Did not like work, anyhow. Had even been shifted
from his boiler by a later descendant of the ladder
of luck. Bon of a baronet this one, but a boor.
Did not know ten lines of Terence, and could not
repeat a verse of Horace to save his life. And so
forth. He was an amusing tramp, and we will-
ingly spent an hour —and also half-a-crown in
his company. When we left him, ho was chanting
choruses from Sophocles to himself, superior to
fortune and to fate. This was the last we saw of
him, till about a year after. We had been walking
wearily down the block in George-street, towards
the Post Office, in the desperate nope of getting a
letter informing us that one of our relatives was
dead, and had left us something. We got the
letter. It was an uncle who was dead. He left us a
mourning ring made of his hair, and his portrait
upon which wo had to pay sevenpence postage.
It was just after we had got these gifts, and were
standing under the Post Office portico gloomily
speculating on the probable future of a man who
could calmly face eternity after leaving an affec-
tionate and indigent nephew a hair-ring and a
portrait with sevenpence to pay on It. when we
caught sight of our friend the tramp. But he was
a tramp no longer, or, if a tramp, a beautified one.
He was dressed in elegant apparal, wore patent-
leather boots, and smoked a Henry Clay. We
knew It by the smell. He recognised us almost as
soon as we did him, and came up with the old In-
dolent grace, and shook hands with us. “ Wealth
and beauty at last?” we said smilingly, while the
bitter thought of our own blighted hopes was
burning at our heart. “ No,” he replied, in that
style of inimitable languor peculiar to lazy men
who smoke Henry Clays, and regard the workaday
world as rather a pantomime than otherwise. Then
he also smiled, but mysteriously. “ Let us take a
glass of wine together,” he said, in a still serener
tone We replied that we had no objection. We
would have made the same reply to a suggestion
of taking tar-water, for that matter. Over the
wine he enlightened us as to how he did it, and It
but faintly expresses our feeling to say that it
pretty nearly catalepsed us. “You see,” he
began, poising his glass with a finger and
thumb so that the wine would catch colour
from the in-streaming sunshine, “ you see
some time after I met you, I happened to catch
the eye of an undertaker. He was beginning in
business, this undertaker. He had been some time
beginning, but he had not come to the business,
rival undertaker had a shop close by, and funerals
were always dashing out of the gateway. Used to
stand at his door, too, and make sarcastic remarks
about my undertaker, who never had a funeral.
My undertaker was very much cut up about this,
and began to brood over a plan of revenge. So,
seeing mo pass his shop one day (I was on my way
to the Library to make an intellectual breakfast
on ‘ Bacon ’—a rather weak joke, hut as strong as
I could venture upon in my delicate state of health
at that time), he called me in, and after—very
politely, I must say—asking me to join him in a
glass of whisky, wished to know if I would like to
make money without having to work for it. Of
course, I replied that I would. It was always my
idea of how money should he made —by me.
4 Then,’ said he, 4 1 have a nice, quiet occupation to
offer you. You will be driven about most of the
time; and when you are not driven about, you
will be carried. All you will have to do will bo to
lie still and take your ease. And you will be well
paid for it. Do you agree ?’ I, of course, answered
that I would agree, and then enquired what the
occupation was. * Well,’ he said, 4 you see, I have
to make a show of business to get business. It is
the same in every trade. Besides, I want to make
the other man think I am doing better than he. It
will hurt his feelings; and I want to hurt his feel-
ings. He has too many funerals for me.’ 4 What
you want me to do, then, is ?’ I suggested. “ To
play the part of a corpse,’ he replied, briskly. 4 You
will only have to go out three or four
times a day, and have all your evenings to
yourself. And when trade begins to get
brisk, you will only have to go out two
or three days a week. 4 It is a light, pleasant job,’
he added, seeing I seemed to hesitate at the idea of
acting the part of a dead man, 4 and you will get
so fond of it after a while that you will sleep iu a
coffin by choice. I know,’ he continued in a
whisper, ’because I have done it myself, but I
have to stay In the shop now or the other party
would get suspicious. Can’t be in the shop and the
hearse too at the same time, you know.’ He made
this last remark in a jocular tone, and asked me to
take another glass of whisky. I did, 4 Is it a bar-
gain, then?’ he enquired. I replied that it was.
He immediately took me out into his workshop
and showed me a superb coffin yined with blue
satin. 4 That’s your cherry-case,’ he r remarked,
’only it’s rose-wood. You being a gentleman I
wouldn’t offer you a piner.’ Then he showed me a
suit of grave-clothes, which I must say were as
neat and airy-looking as any corpse could desire.
’And now if it’s all the same to you,’ be said,
’we’ll begin business to-day. Funeral starts at
half-past two—so be ready.’ Well, there’s no need
to tell you much more. I have been playing a
deader ever since. Business came in rapidly to
him after that, and his rival grew green with envy.
Of course my engagements became intermit-
tent, but, nevertheless, I was always retained
to be dead when necessary. Besides,
the population Increased, so did undertak,. <
There are several others in the corpse line be, g
myself, but I get most of tbe engagements, be.fig
more accustomed to the business. It is a nice,
cheerful, gentlemanly occupation. You mighttry
it. I can get you a billet at once, if you like. No
other references required, and you are not asked
to keep sober. Thinic of it. I must go now. Got
to be dead at three o’clock precisely.” We were
too paralysed with what he had told us to stop
him, although we had several questions to ask
him. We wanted to ask, for instance, whether
they really buried him, and, if so, how long they
let him lie underground before exhuming him.
We shall see him again, however. And when wo
do, we shall certainly accept his offer and go into
the cadaver business ourselves. If we continue
writing for papers much longer, we shall have no
chance. We shall be dead in earnest.
A lawyer says that a convenient way of
testing the affections of your intended is to marry
another woman. If she don’t love you, you will
find it out immediately.
From the New York Woman’s Journal:—
44 One of the nicest girls I have met this summer
at the sea-side is to be a bride in the present month.
She is a philosophic little thing, I noticed that her
to-be-husband was being slowly, gently, but none
thh less surely, let down from the heights of
shadowy sentiment to the solidities of human actu-
ality. Let me illustrate my meaning. She waltzed,
one night, with the infatuated fellow; and, on
seating her af my side, he whispered rapturously,
4 1 really think you have wings on your heels, you
danced so lightly.’ 4 Not a wing,’ she replied; 4 the
fact is that I had No. 3 shoes on No. 3 feet, and I
felt as though I were stumping round on my
ankles. But just now my pet corn stings through
the numbness.’ 4 Ah,’ sighed the persistently ro-
mantic fellow, 4 then the wings extend Invisibly
from your shoulders, dear girl/ 4 Well, it’s safe to
say,’ the heavenly seraph responded, ’that if any
wings are attached to me they are somewhere out-
side of my corset, for there isn’t room for half a
breath inside.’ This was one of the nicest girls
that ever graced a ball-room, and I asked her how
on earth she could talk so to her sweetheart. 4 1’H
tell you,’ she said. 4 There is usually a shock of
disenchantment for the husband after marriage,
so I’m told, when he finds out that his wife is
actually a human being. Now, I mean to bring
my lover gradually to just such a point in
the revelation of me, understand, that when we
get married there will be no shock—merely, as one
might say, a passage from kisses to connubiality.’

Itching Skin Diseases
ECZEMA, or Salt Rheum, with its agonizing
itching and burning, instantly relieved by a
warm bath with Cuticura Soap and a single ap-
plication of Cuticura, the great Skin Cure This
repeated daily, with two or three doses of Cuti-

tating, the bowels open, the liver and kidneys ac-

Psoriasis, Lichen, Pruritus, Scalled Head, Dand-
ruff, and every species of Itching, Scaly, and
Pimply Humors of the Scalp and Skin, when the
best physicians and all known remedies fail.
I HAVE been afflicted with a troublesome skin
disease, covering almost completely the upper
part of my body, causing my skin to assume a
copper-colored hue. It could be rubbed off like
dandruff, and at times causing intolerable Itching
and the most intense suffering. I have used blood
purifiers, pills, and other advertised remedies, but
experienced no relief until I procured the Cuti-
cura Remedies, which, although used carelessly
and irregularly, cured me, allaying that terrible
itching and restoring my skin to its natural color.
I am willing to make affidavit to the truth of this
statement.

November, 1884.
BY the present we beg to announce to our Patrons and the Public in general that our
New Premises, situated at 175 PITT-STREET, near the corner of King-street, have
now been opened under the style of GUNSLER’S CAFE.
Thankful for the liberal support extended to us since commencing business at 110
King-street some nine months ago, we now present to our customers a place which stands
unequalled in the colonies for extension, comfort, and elegance.
GUNSLER’S CAFE will supply a want much felt, forming in the heart of the city a
most convenient resort for Ladles as well as Gentlemen, whose requirements have been

We simply invite inspection, and hope that the fame and success achieved by Mr.

here, and make GUNSLER’S CAFE the general rendezvous of the polite world of Sydney.

ANDROCLES AND THE LION.
[A NEW TRANSLATION.]
There was once a slave named Androcles,
who was so ill-troated by his master that bis life
became insupportable. He was expected to turn
out at 8 o’clock In all weathers to milk the cow,
but was allowed none of the milk to mix with his
rum. His eggs were boiled hard by the time he
got back, his coffee was only lukewarm, and his
toast gone dry. To add to his misery, ihe girl was
forbidden to bring him up a cup of hot coffee in
the bed, and his callous master, having discovered
him with his mouth to the decanter, more than in-
sinuated that he would prefer that his slaves
should slick to their allowance of two sesterces
(about three pints) of gin per .day, and keep their
mouths from his bottle. Neither was he permitt
to cut off a slice of ham. and make himself a sand-
wich, while attending at dinner, al thou g
he was quitp capable of , J f * v

knew he was subject to a sinking of the
stomach. Things went from worse,

going out for the night; and if he only walked
into his master’s dressing-room for the tooth-
brush and comb, to titivate himself up a bit,
was the devil to pay. This treatment began to
prey on his mind to such an extent that as be
mixed his master’s night cap of toddy, ihls trem-
bling hand could scarce lift the b's bps.
when he wanted to see if he had just hit*** „
flavour. But when his master s income had some-
what fallen off, and he was asked to chop wood.
and dine off corned beef and carrots, and
his afternoon nap from two to four, heteltthac
the time was come for action. Ho therefore
pushed a rapid sale of his masters cigars and
watches, made up a small portmanteau, and just
taking one mournful glanco in the glass
whether his wool hadn't turned white, be left
word with his old master to go to the devil, went
into the back slumsof Athens, from which, having
spent his last farthing, he was " fired out, and be-
took him to the woods for a little bushranging.
He wandered about for some days without food,
and cursed the day when he despised corned beef
and carrots, and a quart of beer to wash it down had
been held in contempt. But still his principles
bore him up; and in his bitterest anguish, when
he was almost fainting with hunger and tempted
to go back and beg pardon of his master, he re-
membered that there was wood to be chopped,
and no afternoon nap, and he said, No. Inthls
solitude I need chop no wood, and I may 8l ?f r p
the turf as much as I choose. Better liberty and
lumbago than corned beef and slavery. • •
afternoon when he had been lying bj 8 back
chewing roots for some hours, and thinking or
nothing at all, he was startled by the of a
prodigious lion, and shinned up to the topmost
branch of a white gum to consider the situation.
The lion sat down at the foot of the tree and de-
minded a narlev* 44 As monarch of this forest,

turned Androcles, with the branch sh aking under
him. “ and having hoard that in this region, blest
with a constitutional monarchy, I might enjoy
that measure of freedom which 'was wrested from
me by a heartless and anarchic oligarchy, I fled
hither.” “ It shall never be said,” returned the
noble lion licking his lips and noticing the plump-

that he had frequently cut his masters corns.
“ Then approach,' said the lion, bftmg up a
swollen paw; “approach, and remove this splinter
from my foot.” But this poor slave did not stir
an inch, until the King had solemn y assured him
that in all his expeditions he would reserve for
him the brisket and the undercut of the sirloin.
Androcles hereupon descended, and was about to
approach and raise the wounded paw, when a band

Calicula, the last of the Grecian Emperors,
sat on a golden throne at the entrance to the Par-
thenon of the great Coliseum in Athens. Tens of
thousands filled the vast arena, for Caligula had
announced that a slave was that day to be torn in
pieces by a lion, and all the Greek clergy were
present to solemnise the dreaa occasion. This
day,” said the Archbishop, “ will remain for ever
in the memory of man, as marking the national
abhorrence of the characters of men who use
their God-given intelligence to corrupt, by their
lives and teaching, the minds of youth. A dread-
ful silence ensued, and a trembling slave was led
forth A door was opened, and a monstrous lion,
with flaming eyes and jaws that gaped like an open
sepulchre, darted forth and swallowed the slave in
two bites. His name was ASsop, and it was whilst

ROWLANDS ODONTO is the best, pur-
est, and most fragrant preparation for the teeth.
Health depends in a great measure upon the
soundness of the teeth and their freedom from
decay, and all dentists allow that neither washes
nor pastes can possibly be as efficacious for polish-
ing the teeth and keeping them sound and white
as a pure and non-gritty tooth powder; such Row-
lands’ Odonto has always proved itself to be.
B OWAKDS EUKONIA is a beautifully
pure, delicate, and fragrant toilet powder, and has
lately been much improved. Each box has inside
the lid a certificate of purity from Dr. Redwood,
Ph.D., F.C.8., &c. Sold in three tins : white, rose,
and cream.
ROWLANDS’ MACASSAR OIL can now
be also had in a golden colour, which is especially

NEVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Mignon has done since
its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival us—blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result hare they to show,
excepting to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, Avith showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Mignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies—in victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the far north of Queens-
land ; in New Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its name is really a household
word.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite.
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be imitations.
THE MIGNON PIANO
guaranteed to withstand any climate in Australia.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the cheapest, because the best.
THE MIGNON PIANO
can be hadjon very easy TIME PAYMENT.
THE MIGNON PIANO
excels all similar pianos. for first-class work and
richness of tone.

VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
MASHERS AND THEIR VICTIMS.
Thus far, the Muse has taught her slave to
speak _
In such mild strains that the betraying cheek
Of purest maiden need not know the flush
Of Virtue’s danger-sign, the warning blush;
Thus far. the patient reader has been led
By paths which guileless Innocence may tread—
Tracks such as those which Fashion’s self would
choose, .... * .
Where no x rude stones the shrinking foot may
bruise.
But, now another path the Muse desires,
Where “ treacherous ashes cover glowing fires
(This phrase, you note, is Horace’s, not mine—
See Book two, ode one, and the seventh line);
And here all they who follow needs must wear
Sandals of sense, which now. with jealous care,
Our boasting Modesty has laid aside,.
As not required by those whom she would.gulde.
If, then, some reader should disdain to gaze
On those dark scenes which social life displays,
And shrink with signs of hyper-modest fear
From words which, weekly, when in church, we
hear,
Whether the curate read or vicar speak,
Tempt not mind to flush the conscious
chock
To such I say: “ If your too shrinking mind
To social evils would be always blind—
And if your tongue, fastidious, is afraid
To use plain terms, and call a spade a * spade,
Read on no farther now: this theme complete.
The Muse once more shall spurn words indis-
creet.”
But they who wear the triple coat of mail
Which Virtue lends, yet notice and bewail
The many ills that load our social state
And truly wish those evils to abate,
May, with some interest, these lines peruse,
And laud the object, though they slight the
Muse.
1 write of mashers, dudes, and all the crew
Whose vicious minds Impel them to pursue
To earthly ruin those, like Mother Eve,
Who wake to knowledge, and then live to grieve.
I say to earthly ruin—He who sees
Our place on earth shall judge of crime s de-
grees :
To everyone the crown or pain condign,
Sweet Mercy and stern Justice shall assign.
Then shall we know, what no one now may tell,
Whether such victims have not lived their hell.
Many the arts these mashers can employ,
While gilded Humbug acts as a decoy;
Lures on the maid, who, not suspecting aught
That’s wrong, wakes only when her ruin s
wrought; ,
Then see’s herself debased from Virtue s throne,
Whilst lover, friends, and fame alike have flown:
Deeper she sinks, no helper calls her hack,
And p’r’aps her death hell’s rung by murd'rous
quack.
At first, perchance, in Sunday-school or choir
The lovers (?) meet —for dudes with foul desire
Resort to churches, and, with pious dress,
Conceal their lust and dark perfldlousness.
The quiet evening walk, in secret planned—
The gentle pressure of a thrilling hand,
The whispered compliment, and soft reply:
The flattering glance and smile—too soon supply
Wings to the shaft, that speeds from Cupid’s
bow,
And bid love, all unchecked, in fulness flow:
Suspicion from the maiden’s breast is thrust,
And perfect love produces perfect trust.
Woman's true love—guerdon above all price,
The only relic lelt of Paradise I
When our first parents were from Eden driven,
This, this alone, was left to symbol Heaven.
Though woman's fall entailed our human grief,
’Tls she alone, on earth, can give relief:
Her boundless kindness earth-born woes can
charm,
And yield to ev’ry wound its healing balm,
A mother’s love—in childhood’s days so dear,
And valued more in each advancing year;
A sister's love—producing, every hour,
Some newer token of its wondrous power;—
These each are noble gifts, and yet beside
The strength of woman’s love, when its full tide
Goes with her heart, but as a taper's light
Contrasted with the rounded orb of night.
Yet all too oft the maiden’s generous flame
But burns the barriers that encircle shame;
Too oft the pseudo-lover plays a part,
And steals her virtue when she gives her heart -
Betrays the trust so lovingly bestowed,
And starts his victim on the downward road.
Shall we, then, scorn as vile and infamous,
A woman who has loved and fallen thus ?
Mark Twain (in “ Tramp Abroad,” unless I err,
The book’s not here, so that I can’t refer,)
Tells how a bride rushed to an early.gravo,
In that bright land which Arnold died to save.
By narrow path, preceded by a guide,
Her party scaled a dizzy mountain’s side:
A wall of rook, whose dark forbidding face
Was one long precipice from peak to base
SThe path is one that tourists tread with care—
II fares the man whose mule may stumble there).
The girl looked round; in front, on left and right
The ether seemed in volume infinite;
Straight down beneath she saw the far-off plain,
The sight was too vast for her whirling brain;
She faltered—reeled—sprang Into empty space,
As though she longed to rest in its embrace—
One cry of anguish showed that, all too late.
She knew her madness, and beheld her fate.
Do we blame her, and quote our maxims wise,
Say that she took her leap with open eyes ?
No, surely not; although she sought her doom.
Let Mowers of pity wreath her self-made tomb.
Here we must stop, for want of further space,
Till Phoebus seven times runs his fiery race;
But, with these days o’erpast, again the lute
Shall hymn the fate of “Beauty" and the
“Brute.”
ISHMAEL.
WILL MCDONALD’S STORY
I had eczema and salt rheum for seventeen
years. I had it on my head, face, neck, arms, and
legs. I was not able to walk, only on my hands
and knees, for one year. I have not been able to
help myself for eight years. I tried hundreds of
remedies: not one had the least effect. The doc-
tors said my case was incurable; so my parents
tried everything that came along, I saw your
advertisement, and concluded to try Cuticdba
Remedies. The Cuticura brought the humor to
the surface of my skin. It would drop off as it
came out, until now 1 am entirely well. All I can
say is I thank you most heartily for my cure. Any
person who thinks this letter a fraud, let them
write or come and see me, and find out for them-
selves. WILL M’DONALD, 2543 Dearborn-Street,
Chicago, 111. . _

Temperance clergymen, lawyers, ladies,

cate, but restore brain and nerve waste.
Aybr’s Ague Cure is a powerful tonic
bitter, composed wholly of vegetable substances.
Its action is pecular, prompt and powerful, break-
up the chill, curing the fever, and expelling the
poison from the system, yet leaving no harmful or
unpleasant effect upon the patient. Sufferers
from chills and fevers who have used quinine as a
pomedy will appreciate this.
The recent experience of Mr. Justice
Grove, on circuit in North Wales, is said to have
been unique. His Lordship found absolutely no
prisoners at three assizes, and received three pairs
of white kid gloves. At Ruthin, the judge, the
sheriff, chaplain, a full bar attendance, grand and
petty juries, and the sheriff’s retinue assembled to
try one petty civil suit. Please observe, a'l this
happened in North Wales. In [New] South Wales
things are far more lively, and an assize judge
gets a pair of white kids about as often as a tom-
cat voluntarily goes to sea.
When our railing has all fallen awry, and
our tombstone has cumbled away, and the grass
above us affords succulent herbage to the nefari-
ous goat, it will be remembered that, with all our
crimes, we were never wanting when genius was
struggling for recognition. We have recognised
several poets already, and they are to-day listening
with dreamy souls to the wall of the forest as they
put up the chock-and-log fence of Industry. And
so we hail the advent of Mr. R. Small, of Sydney,
who has sent his modest appeal for fame to a New
England paper. Instead of flaunting it In the pro-
fane eye of a venal metropolitan press. Here is
one chirp
“ A mournful voice now haunts my hour
Of stolen, sacred muse,
Which tells me of a faded flower,
And whispers solemn news.”
That is the movement, dear Small. And now a
mournful voice haunts our hour of stolen muse,
algo—
One Mr. Small the muse provoked,
And roused her bitter choler;
“ To think,” she cried, “that I’m invoked
To make a small thing smaller.”
The smartest man on this side of the line
has just gone through the mill again, and come out
white on the other side. This is how he operated.
A few years ago he bought a section of land for
£100, on the agreement that the vendor would
take a mortgage for the full amount of the pur-
chase money, and also advance him a sum of
money equal to three fourths of the value of a
large house he Intended erecting on the ground.
Having signed the mortgage for £100 with his
usual flourish, be said to the vendor, who was a
lawyer, and thought he knew a thing or two.
“ Now you must give me a receipt for this £100.”
“ What £100? ” asked the man of quibbles, quite
astonished. “ Why, the £100 mentioned in this
document, which states that you have advanced
me that sum. You know you have not advanced
it. You have kept it to pay for the section, and I
want a receipt to show the land is mine.” “Very
well,” said tne lawyer, “ I think I see what you
mean. I’ll give you a receipt.” And he did. He
also gave him an agreement to make the advance
required on the house when built. With these two
documents in his fist the speculator next inter-
viewed a timber merchant. “ I have just bought a
piece of around,” he said, “and paid cash for it.
Here is the receipt for it. I want you to give me
enough timber to build a house. You see when
it is built, this other document states I am to get
an advance on it to three-fourths its value, so I’ll
have no difficulty in paying for it.” The timber
was got, the house built and finished; a new-chum
passing by thought it would suit him, and offered
£600 for it. The price was accepted, and the money
paid. When the purchaser came to take posses-
sion, the speculator said to him, rather gruffly,
“When are you going to take away this house?”
“'lake it away 1 ” gasped the other; “why, I
bought it where it is; I don’t want to take it
away; I want to come and live in it.” Then the
speculator stormed and swore, declaring he only
sold the house; he wanted the section, to build
another on it. The sale note and receipt given at
the time only mentioned the house, and said no-
thing about the section. In short, he worked his
point so well that in the end the buyer thought
himself lucky in getting the house and section
together by agreeing to take up the £100 mortgage.
The speculator then went into business with his
£600, m a wholesale merchant, and recently failed
I for £35,000, the dividend amounting to 2%d. in the
£. This is why we are so positive that they didn t
know everything down in Judee.and that a modern
Oceanic Gentile knows more than Solomon in
all his glory, with the single exception of a pene-
trating knowledge of womankind. There, if y9u
like, Solomon had the start of any colonist
extant.
Ah Chung is his name, and for ways that
are wild this heathen Chinee is peculiar. Fro™
Information received, it appears that Constable
Stutchbury, of the Monaro District, recently had
the felicity of digging up, in accordance with
official instructions, a dead Chinaman who
had been planted in the Thredbo cemetery—the
object of this body-snatching adventure being to
recover a £5 note which, marvellous to relate, had
been burled with the defunct Mongolian. Ah
Chung, having nothing particular to do, joined
the constable in his frolic, and immediately after-
wards began to exhibit unmlstakeable signs ot
having a bad attack of the fantods. Travelling
along to Cooma, he armed himself with a toma-
hawk ; and as he passed through a place called
Cobbin, he created a great deal of amusement by
chasing the inhabitants round the place for the
purpose of showing them how surgical operations
were carried on in China. After this, he visited
the Berridale Hotel, stuck up four women and six
men, and then marching them out in the yard was
about to hold a series of Impromptu executions
after the most approved fashion of his native land.
A Nlngpo man named O’Brien strongly objected to
take part in the proceedings, and, instead of step-
ping out and putting his neck across a log as re-
quested, he caught the frolicsome Mr. Ah Chung a
“ sockdologer ” under the ear that completely
knocked all the humour out of him for the time
and sent him whizzing head first into an adjacent
workshop. Having carefully picked the chips out
of his ears, and rolled up his tail, Ah Chung started
off once more, and, meeting a hawker named John
Gerrathy, politely requested a lift in his c irt. This
was at once granted, the two Johns jogging along
together, chatting sociably about Parnell, the crops
and the “ edjycashin ” question, when suddenly
John Chung catching John Gerrathy fiercely by
the arm, flourished a young sapling over his head
and requested him to look up in the sky and see all
the dead Chinamen that were floating about with
their throats cut and blue lire and green devils
dancing all about them. Mr. Gerrathy said never
a word on hearing this, but getting quickly out of
the cart, he crossed himself three times, said about
14,000 Pater Nosters, and allowed Mr. Chung to tool
his team into the yard of Mullane’s Pine Valley
Hotel. Here he tried hard to persuade his com
panion to walk in and inspect the fittings of the
stable. His friend briefly replied that the bar was
more in his line, and accordingly he marched in
and began to make things nice and lively for the
landlord and his customers. Seeing the Celestial
crank at his game, the watchful Gerrathy imme-
diately bitched up his team, and jumping on his
seat drove off at a gallop, congratulating himself
on having got so well rid of the heathen. Just as
he was chuckling over his adventure, he felt a
clammy hand grasping his own, and turning round
was horrified to find the irrepressible Ah Chung
crawling out from under the seat and pointing
skywards once more with the mild request that he
(Mr. Gerrathy) should go alolt and pull off the
dragon that was holding a picnic on the dead bodies
of his countrymen. Then Mr. Gerrathy came down
from the cart once more, not that he was at all
afraid, lout simply because he thought a walk into
Cooma would do him good, a d having arrived
there, he lost no time in introducing the local
police to his Imaginative fellow-passenger. Th<
general opinion up Monaro way is that the sight < f
the “ demnition dead body ” exhumed in the
Thredbo boneyard turned Ah Chung's brain-pan
upside down; but our own private belief is that
he was sent off his kadoova by being an eye-wit-
ness to the fact that the police had omitted to
search a corpse, and had actually burled a “ fiver ”
with the body. Such a startler as that would con-
fuse the beau of a nail-teg,
The gifted party who wrote “A New Way
to Pay Old Debts ” has been knocked clean out by
a long-headed leech down South, who has just in-
vented “A New Way to Collect Old Debts,” which
is at once so simple and efficacious as to recom-
mend itself to all—debtors, of course, excepted.
From what we can learn, it appears that this art-
ful dodger, Mr. Dundetterbyname, runs a grocery,
and is also a legally ordained member of our noble
band of colonial J.’sP. Mr. Neverpart is a gentle-
man who resides in the same town, and who for
the past three years has stood mighty bad on the
slate of the little grocery round the corner. On
the morning of the Prince of Wales’ natal day,
Mr. Neverpart was full to the ears with patriotism,
but long before t*>e shades of eve began to fall he
Just as full of beer. That night he availed him-
selt of the hospitality of Constable Decimal Naught

i°cal lock-up, and next morning marched along

* r£ UI ik® w k° had done full justice to thetoastof
Albert Edward. Hearing that his debtor was
lumbered, the downy Dundetter hauled on a clean
shirt, had a 3d.-shave, and took his seat on the
judicial bench looking stern enough as he did to
scare the soul out of a fossil. And Mr. Neverpart,
having owned up like a man to the soft impeach-
ment, His Worship observed; “Neverpart, I am
surprised and pained beyond all expression to find
you—a man that I have known, respected, and
even trusted for years—in the humiliating position
that you are at present. All is not lost, however,
and you may yet redeem your fallen reputation.
Between ourselves now, what about that little
account of ours ? It’s been on the chalk a long
while now,, you know; but I have heard that
you ye got a long job from old Smith on the Plains,
so tell you what I’ll do. You gimme an order on
Smith for the full amount, and I’ll dismiss this
oa8 x e li., J yo, j don’t, hup y’ go for seven days wid-
out th hoption’.” Order given, case knocked out,
and the Insulted majesty of Justice once more
avenged. Thete be facts, and it's hard to improve
upon them.
There is insubordination, bordering on
rank mutiny, in the standing army of Victoria,
which that intrepid warrior, Major-General Sar-
good, will have to put down with a high hand, or
we tremble for the future of Australia. Instruc-
tions were recently Issued to the horse-drivers of
the East Melbourne Artillery, that the officers’
accoutrements and trappings, including their
boots, should be cleaned and polished for the next
parade of the corps. Well, the horse-encouragers
were not disposed to quarrel over the accoutre-
ments and things; but when it came to cleaning
the officers’boots, why, they just drew the line—
not so much on account of the menial nature of
the work as the extra amount of labour Involved
in going over I he ground For, be it known to all
and sundry that when an East Melbourne Artillery
officer puts down his hoof, he covers a good deal
of real estate. Which reminds us of a black
tracker we once saw in Narandera. It was during
the time of the “ Kelly scare,” when every well-
regulated police camp was furnished with an
aboriginal sleuth-hound, so +o speak, whose duty
it was to keepwell to the front, so as to receive
the first volley from the outlaws, and to give the
regular troopers time to beat a masterly retreat.
The Narandera tracker bore the name of Welling-
ton, or Nelson, or Wolseley, or some of the naval
or military heroes of Great Britain—we forget
which—and, being a slim-built child of nature, the
resources of the second-hand department of the
police stores were not severely taxed to provide a
constabulary uniform for him. Bnt when it came
to getting him shod, there was nothing in the
whole ran»e of the Government stores to lit, ex-
cept a pair of shoe-trunks, and, as they were
found to be inconvenient when riding through
scrubby country, they were reluctantly discarded,
and forthwith condemned as unsuited to guerilla
warfare. Then Wellington, or whatever his name
was. had to ride bare-foot, and a picturesque old
rooster he looked heading a cavalcade of troopers
to death or glory, ids feet flapping on each side of
his fiery charger with cheerful abandon, being too
large to take any grip of the stirrup-irons. It
saved him a lot ot boot-cleaning, though. But we
digress. Let’s see, we were talking about the
Victorian hemes ? To resume. So a dozen of the
drivers decided that at the next parade, should the
question crop up, they would be prepared for the
emergency, and when Majah King stepped lightly
to the front with the order, “The drivers who
refuse to clean the officers’ [trappings, step for-
ward,” they came out en masse. This was a bit of
a surprise to the Majah, but he promptly lined
them 10s, each for disobedience, which in turn gave
i.oe Jenna a start, as it meant a serious item out ot
their munificent salaries of £10 per annum. But
they are determined to see the matter through;
and should an appeal to head-quarters not result in
their favour, they will probably resign from the
army, the crack corps of the colony will getall
broken up. and the hearths and homes of the fair
Southern land will be at the mercy of the first
mvnuer that chooses to come »long. And all this
trouble, too, over a mere boot-blscking atfairl
We would, with all due humility, suggest to Com-
mandant Sargood—wo can afford to ignore Majah
King-to organize a boot-black brigade in connec-
tion with his standing army. Or, better still, let
the officers copy the example of old Wellington,
the black-tracker. There’s millions in the sugges-
tion.
Our illustration shows two dainty dresses for young girls. The figured one is of grey
sateen with red spots. The skirt, drapery and sleeves, are ornamented with cross
bands piped with scarlet, and the buttons on the plastron are also scarlet.
The other, a self-coloured cashmere with velvet cuffs and collar, is made with a box-
pleated skirt and plain polonaise, and is neat and serviceable.
