Geon vinyl resin. In the manufacture of life lackets, life belts and other marine wear,
Geon is a friend indeed. Tough on the job, film made from Geon withstands the
abuse of sunshine, salt water, soft water ... is wear and tear resistant. Soft and pliable,
it allows freedom of movement, is colour-fastly bright for easy “spotting”. More and
more manufacturers are discovering how Geon improves products or helps evolve new
ones. Have you a product we can help improve or develop?

IN 48 HOURS GRACE BROS. RE-
MOVALS PERFORMED ONE OF THE
BIGGEST OFFICE MOVES IN AUST-
RALIA. GRACE BROS. MOVED THE
RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA!
$400,000 (the bank thinks decimal)
worth of furniture and equipment
moved about three hundred yards.
That’s right. Just across the street.
It wasn’t easy; Grace Bros. Re-
movals will tell you that. But no
moving job is “easy.” Each job
requires careful thought, planning
and special equipment. If it’s a
really BIG job—across the street, or
across the world —call Grace Bros.
The Bank job included moving two
plastic coated “ears of wheat” that
had been used as models for bank
notes! Get the idea? Grace Bros,
don’t specialise in “big” jobs or
“small” jobs. They specialise in
moving! Why did we tell you about
the big job first? Everybody likes
to brag a little.

How to read a cork
and astound your friends
Tonight, when you coax the stopper
from a bottle of your favourite wine,
spare a few moments and consider
the cork.
It may seem an insignificant Object,
dull and mundane, but if has an
interesting story to tell.
It started its life as a tiny part of the
craggy bark covering a majestic tree
in Portugal. Tonight, it will have com-
pleted its task, and have nothing
before it but an ignominious trip to
the dust bin.
What was this task? A vital one in the
maturing and ageing of your wine. It
created a seal that was not a seal...
a barrier that prevented the wine from
escaping, but at the same time
allowed just the right amount of air
to enter the bottle and mature the
wine correctly.
You could say that the relationship
between air and wine is much the
same as between salt and food. Too
much can spoil the final result
too little leaves the best flavour
unrealised.
You see, cork is porous. It is naturally
honeycombed with thousands of
minute air passages that allow the
wine to reach through to the air it
needs to “age" properly. Air (or
rather the oxygen in the air) gives the
wine its chance to reach adulthood
and develop the full character you
expect from your wine.
If you look closely you can see the
tiny holes. As a matter of fact, if the
wine you're serving happens to be a

red this will be easier, because the
natural tannins of the red wine will
have stained the cork showing you
where the wine has been.
So how do you read a cork? If it’s too
moist the wine might be “pricked” or
sour tasting. If there’s a web-like
substance inside the cork it has prob-
ably been attacked by the cork moth.
If the cork is too dry, the wine has
been improperly stored it has been
left standing upright and the wine has
not had a chance to reach through
the cork for its ration of air.
Actually, you don't have to worry
about the cork if the wine comes from
Penfolds. Every Penfolds cork is care-
fully selected and inspected many
times before it reaches your bottle
department or liquor store.
Tonight, give the cork its due consid-
eration. Judge it to see that it has
done its appointed job. Then dispose
of it kindly. (Some people even keep
a collection.)
The wines that need particular atten-
tion to corking and uncorking
are the classic table wines (such as
Penfolds famous Dalwood or Eden
Valley wines). Choose them carefully,
store them carefully, draw the cork
carefully. Your attention is rewarded
by the wine itself particularly if it is
Penfolds. -

We’d be making more profit if we’d
insulated the roof with Fibreglass
Why Fibreglass? Because Fibre-
glass is the best cost/performance
insulation in the world.
Fibreglass saves capital costs, saves
operating costs, and needs no maintenance.
Fibreglass saves an extra 6% on heat loss
compared with the same thickness of any
similar insulation material.
Fibreglass gives greater efficiency with
less weight, saving roof construction cost.
Fibreglass saves on heating and cooling
equipment because its greater efficiency
allows the use of smaller units in heating
and cooling systems.
And you save on maintenance because
Fibreglass won’t warp, rot, shrink or sag.
It is non-corrosive, mould-proof, moisture
resistant and will not burn. Fibreglass lasts
forever and never loses its insulation value.
Fibreglass Wool Insulation is made in several
forms to meet every need of the architect ,

This picture shows some of the Breasting Dolphins and Pier Head
fabricated by Humes Limited at North West Cape.
When the United States Navy Communications Facility at North West Cape in Western Australia required
a 1,100 feet long pier and marine terminal, Humes Limited was the firm chosen by the main contractors to fabricate
the tubular bents, piling, framing, towers and dolphins. Standards had to be high.
Humes Steel factory in Perth had the experience, labour and plant to undertake this large and important
contract. Over 2,600 tons of Australian steel was fabricated into tubular sections up to 39* diameter. Prefabri-
cated sections were then transported 970 miles by rail and road to the construction site. At the site a team of
Hume field engineers, familiar with local conditions and experienced in working in remote underdeveloped areas,
fabricated the components into final sub-assemblies.
Floods and cyclones were encountered during the operation, but our men managed to complete the contract
ahead of time . . . thanks to the good teamwork of all at Humes.

A ll is not well between the NSW

(trouble is at the seat of political news
the shabby, cramped quarters euphemis-
tically called the Press Gallery of State
Parliament.
In July the 20-odd members of the
Press Gallery were told of new rules
(limiting their access to Parliament House.
They now must leave by 5.30 when the
House is not sitting and can stay only
half an hour after the rising of the House
during session. These rules are part of
ia security programme.
| In fact, the privileges journalists enjoy
at Parliament House are grace and favor.
In Parliamentary language, they are
“strangers”. The “strangers” wrote a long
letter of protest, declaring that the new
rules “could have very serious and even
(conceivably publicly dangerous effects
on the capacity of the Press to carry
out its role as informer on public
affairs.” To no avail.

players, Janice Copeland, Ben
Edward Hepple (with Max Mel-
rum taking over half-way) and Walter
Sullivan visited more than 100 towns
presenting three of the one-act plays the
group regularly presents during the lunch-
hour at the AMP theatre.
“Sometimes it seemed,” Sullivan said,
“that we went all that way just for people
to tell us how splendid their local ama-
teur group was and what a good actor
the leading man was. Finally, I used to
say, ‘And have you any good amateur
doctors in this town? Or amateur
dentists?’ ”
Paper War
afternoon papers seem to be
locked in a to-the-death struggle
which can only end in no one caring
which, if either, he buys. All last week
both were running the life story of
Sammy Davis Junior and a series on
eating for better health by visiting
American Lelord Kordel.
Mr Kordel has been in the “Mirror”
promotions stable for several years, but
this year “The Sun” was so anxious
to have its readers share the benefits that
it published four articles, “Written for
‘The Sun' by Lelord Kordel”. Some of
this was word for word from the “Mir-
ror” of previous years. This included
the sad story of actress Mitzi Gaynor
who was out of work, fat and depressed
when she met Mr Kordel. If that sad
story keeps coming up much longer Miss
Gaynor will be even more depressed.
Ten-letter Word
A ustralian Book Week is usually a
fairly limp affair but this time it
is packing more punch. First, Frank
Hardy’s “Yarns of Billy Borker” was
withdrawn because of a reference to
former financier John Woolcott Forbes,
but th e publishers,
Reed's, cleverly scis-
sored out the page and
pasted in another so
that no one would
know the difference.
Then Robin Eakin’s
“Aunts Up the Cross”
was reported with-
drawn from sale, either
because of unflattering
references to the pro-
fessional skill of a firm
of pest exterminators,
or because of incidents
dealing with a Sydney
hostess, now dead.
However, it turns out
that the British pub-
lishers have merely, in
time - honored fashion,
run out of copies be-
fore Christmas and
won’t have more until
the New Year.
Jacaranda Press, having boldly
announced the publication of Tony
Morphett's novel, “Fitzgerald”, with
“four-letter words in their right context”,
discovered they were likely to run into
trouble with a 10-letter one. Morphett's
central character is artist, Bill Fitz-
gerald, and the publishers had overlooked
the existence in Melbourne of artist,
Paul Fitzgerald. However, they are hope-
ful that the matter may be managed
without embarrassment or damage to
Mr Paul Fitzgerald and that it will not
be necessary to ditch the 6000 initial
printing. If they do have to reprint,
they might call it, “Fitzfabinyi”.
Creation
\X7Tthout so much as a glass of sherry,
™ ™ the most expensive collection of
paintings ever shown in Sydney, accord-
ing to dealer Rudy Komon, went on
show at David Jones’ Gallery last week.
These are by Leonard French and
include the Seven Days paintings,
French’s version of the Creation. This
series is on loan from the Australian
National University, which was presented
with the paintings by an anonymous
donor, who paid an equally anonymous
price.
The seventh painting, an intricately
patterned disc in blues, golds and greys,
is 12 feet in diameter and the Komon
gallery is not equipped for the required
long-distance viewing.
The paintings are the result of a how-
did-it-all-begin question from French’s
young son during a family swim off the
coast of Greece in 1962. Although
Komon says French “isn’t a bit religious”
he is probably one of the few parents
on record who has taken three years of
solid work to answer the question. Or
been paid for it.
"No more for me —I have to plot a coup d'etat."


THIS AUSTRALIA
VIETNAM
Hasluck’s Long Haul
It was typical of the war Australian troops are fighting in Vietnam: an inconclusive
and viciously fought battle which was over in an hour. Yet it was the heaviest
engagement the Australians had fought in War Zone D. The others had been brushes
of a few minutes, nonetheless vicious for their short duration.
In last week’s hour-long action the
Australians suffered five casualties in the
first minute of fighting in the jungle
about 30 miles from Saigon; one missing,
believed dead, and four wounded. An-
other two deaths at the weekend brought
the Australian casualty list since 1963
to 13 dead, 85 wounded, 2 missing
believed killed.
The latest clashes lent extra weight to
the warning from the Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, Mr P. Hasluck, at the
weekend. “I would not encourage any
Australian to think South Vietnam is
something we are going to solve quickly.
It is going to be a long haul because
this situation is inseparable from the
power struggle now raging in South-East
Asia.” That struggle, thought Mr Has-
luck, might go on for 25 years.
In the meantime the Australian troops
who are there are facing a formidable
enemy. This is one of the main con-
clusions the Army’s Adjutant-General,
Major-General J. W. Harrison, brought
back from a visit to Vietnam last week.
In Canberra at Army Headquarters he
spoke to John Webb who reports:
Major-General J. W. Harrison return-
ed from Vietnam with no illusions about
the Vietcong, a formidable enemy fight-
ing on his home territory. But he found
the Australians just as tough, superbly
fit and capable of winning the hearts and
minds of the people, a task he says is as
important as winning military victories.
He flew to Vietnam to represent the
Australian armed forces at the massive
Saigon parade which marked the Viet-
namese national day and to talk to the
Diggers. “Make no mistake, the Vietcong
is a tough and clever enemy using the
natural cover and resources of the
country to good advantage,” he said. “But
the Australians don’t come as novices
to this sort of thing. They are tough
and fit, physically competent to do their
job these are professional soldiers
who have pride in their profession and in
their military skill. In short, they are
second to none.” General Harrison found
it a different sort of war. The men are
liable to be involved in action against the
Vietcong at any time, even in their own
base area. There is no traditional front
line from which they can be withdrawn
for rest and relief. They must be con-
stantly on the alert.
“But we have a good deal of back-
ground in this sort of war,” he said.
“Many of the men have served in
similar types of operations in Malaysia
and there is a fair stiffening of Korea
veterans. Now the value of their traning
becomes evident. Their discipline is
excellent, not the crime and punishment
sort of discipline, but the discipline of a
well-trained unit and a sort of self-
discipline, the whole man as it were.
“I went around and talked to them
last week. They’re cheerful and fit and
as always have a deep and abiding sense
of humor. These men will, as they have
been doing, perform very well all of the
tasks allotted to them.”
Then what are the tasks allotted to
them? They are sent on patrols con-
stantly, from their own base area and
from other chosen points to which they
are air-lifted or driven. The military brief
is simple: seek out and destroy Vietcong.
The Australians, clad in jungle green
shirts, trousers and soft, cloth “giggle”
hats are in their element on patrols.
“The Australian Army has always been
distinguished for its ability on patrol.’’
General Harrison said. “Our men arc
trained in observation, close fighting,
ambush techniques, camouflage and
fighting drills. These are guerrilla ac-
tions with occasional hot little actions
between sizeable forces.”
The techniques used by the Australians
were evolved and developed in other
theatres, but they have adapted them- 1
selves to the country and fight to their
own interpretation of this type of war-
fare; their weapons are equal to any in
the Western world. Their personal
equipment, light-weight bedding and
jungle hammock developed in Australia,
has impressed the Americans. They tote
their plastic blow-up beds, which can
double for stretchers, on their backs.
General Harrison turned to the
people. “The Australians have no pro-
blems with the villagers they get on
well together. And this is the essential
part of the war, gaining the hearts and
minds of the people. The Australians
have to treat any villagers they meet in
the course of an operation with decency 1
and humanity. This is just as important
as gaining ground since these people
have to be shown that this is the right
way. It is difficult for the people they
have lived under these brutal conditions
for years and they are often terrorised by
the Vietcong at night.”
It is no accident that when the Aus-
tralians arrive to search a Vietnamese'S
village they know to ask for the head-
man, what customs to respect. The 1
jungle training school at Canungra, where
the Australians learned their art, has a
complete Asian village. The trainees are,
taught how to flush out the houses, how
to behave themselves. Then do these
diplomat-soldiers know what they are
fighting for?
“Of course they do, they have been;
briefed, they study current affairs and.,
read newspapers and books. Part of
their routine, the CO’s hour, comprises,
current affairs discussions.” Do they re-,
sent the controversy back home? “I don’t
think it affects their confidence in any,
way,” he said. “They realise that in a
democracy there is a right of free speech
and people can say what they please. 1
went around and found them all in
good heart.”
The troops made it clear they wanted
top-line entertainment and the Govern-
ment plans to provide them with it. Day-
leave to Saigon depends on the opera-
tional position. _
The war has exposed no weakness in'
the training of the Regular Army andj
General Harrison was confident the same
would apply to any National Service-
men posted to Vietnam. He said: “W e
regard them in exactly the same way a*'
the regular soldier. They will achieve the'
same standard and skills. The only dif-
ference will be that they have a shorte
term to serve”.

INDONESIA
Betting on the Generals
“Let us not inflame emotions let there be no burning.” Even as President
Sukarno made the appeal last week on Indonesia's Heroes’ Day it was clear that it
would fall on deaf ears. Terrorism in Central Java and in other areas continued with
PKI rebels burning and killing and the Army taking ruthless revenge where and
when it could.
! The violence which erupted in the
[murder of the six generals during the
September 30 coup had far from run its
course. In Canberra there was still
idoubt not only on what was really
happening, but on what Australia’s

j° n and infiltration perhaps against
f day when Lee Kuan Yew opens his
P arves to barter trade.
In Canberra’s thinking the reasons for
confrontation remain. To look forward
to the disappearance of this South-East
Asian curse if and when the generals
take full power is, it is felt, being merely
wishful. Confrontation and that other
Sukarnoism NECOLIM are ad-
hesives to stick the nation together and
to avoid fragmentation. Even if the
generals do drop Sukarno they will still
have a chaotic economy resting on foun-
dations of wobbly and woolly slogans
they will still need the illusion of an
external threat to underwrite their as-
sumption of power.
Despite this, officials believe, an Army-
controlled Indonesia still offers a better
chance to move along the road to stab-
ility and world respect, and to a position
where there is no longer need to bolster
the internal situation by creating external
bogies and nightmares of British en-
circlement. This being so, we can look
forward to a bolstering of the generals
from outside. Food will be an essential
item soon and equipment of various
kinds may also be sent. But one of Aus-
tralia’s dilemmas is that this cannot be
done in the open. The danger is that
Communist agitators could then urge
the mobs to chant another rabid slogan
against the hated imperialists and to
accuse the generals of being puppets of
the West.
If aid comes to the generals to
strengthen their growing power it will
be acceptable only from some emerging
agency in Asia perhaps the Philip-
pines, Korea, Taiwan or even Japan.
The prevailing view is Australia, Britain
and America must have nothing to do
with these plans. To interfere would do
more harm than good with the sensitive
Indonesians. This probably will not pre-
vent a little nudging from Washington,
Canberra and London to get the pro-
cess going from perhaps Manila, Tokyo,
or some other place acceptable to an
Indonesian general’s sense of aid pro-
priety.
A more immediate concern for the
Indonesian Army last week, as for the
last six weeks, was the whereabouts of
PKI leader Aidit.
From Central Java, correspondent
Haraid Munthe-Kaas writes:
Visiting one of the battalions engaged
in the search for PKI leader Aidit out-
side Surakarta, I was told that however
much they would like to let me accom-
pany them on patrol, my white face
would only prove to the people that they
really were NECOLIM forces.
It is not difficult to sense the tensions
and fears that exist among the people
in Central Java. There has been shoot-
ing in the streets at night in the city of
Surakarta where people are very nervous.
On the 60-kilometre-long highway be-
tween Surakarta and Jogjakarta through
Klaten (the centre of Gestapu activities
and the scene of some of the bloodiest
events of last month) the traffic has
slowed down to a trickle, and all shops
and houses along the route are closed
and their windows barred up.
Up to the end of October, according
to military sources, more than 200
peope belonging to the nationalists and
the religious groups have been killed by
"Well, we're certain of at least one side-effect of the Pill, Sister!"


Cestapu elements in Central Java, while
rebel casualties were reported to be in
the neighborhood of 600 by October 25.
.Mopping-up operations have by no
means ended. I have seen truckloads of
prisoners being brought in for question-
ing at military headquarters both in
Jogjakarta and Surakarta. Up to
October 31, Army sources report, more
than 3000 persons had been arrested in
Central Java.
CRIME
Death Wish
The case of 53-year-old Charles Gar-
rard Fox should give pause to both sup-
porters and opponents of the death
penalty.
On October 21, in Perth Criminal
Court, Fox was sentenced to death for
the murder of a woman who sought to
end her association with him. Minutes
later in a cell beneath the court he stated
calmly before three witnesses two
police constables and his counsel that
he would lodge no appeal and wished to
be hanged as soon as possible. Last week,
in the condemned cell at Fremantle Gaol,
Fox was told that, what one paper called
his “bizarre appeal” had been rejected:
his death sentence had been commuted
to life imprisonment. How he received
this information has not been revealed.
Considering Fox’s death wish, suppor-
ters of capital punishment might question
their habitual contention that the threat
of death has a uniquely deterrent force.
Yet why this a priori argument should
be regarded as commonsense it is difficult
to understand. It is by no means obvious
that condemned men will invariably pre-
fer to have their sentences commuted to
life imprisonment.
In a relatively brief experience with
convicted murderers I encountered one
who broke down and wept bitterly when
reprieved. And recently two “lifers” in a
London prison wrote, in a prisoners’
magazine, that a death sentence would
be “infinitely preferable” to twenty years
in prison. One could, of course, oppose
the death penalty as being “too good for
them let them suffer”; but this is not
open to those who support it as the most
effective deterrent.
Abolitionists moreover rarely do take
this line. They, however, might reflect
on the ironical paradox that commuta-
tion, to life imprisonment in these cir-
cumstances is referred to as an exercise
of the prerogative of mercy. For if we
genuinely wished to be merciful in such
cases, would not the convicted man be
allowed to choose the death sentence;
rather than be forced to endure the
humiliation, frustration and wretchedness
of a lifetime or even twenty years in
prison?
GORDON HAWKINS
Money and Machines
By ALAN REID
The annual Federal Council of the Liberal Party may be the party’s supreme
body. But Sir Robert Menzies did not try to give it an importance which it lacks
when he addressed the Council in Canberra last week.
Where in the ALP machine the
Federal ALP Conference has paramount
directive powers the Liberal Party's
Federal council has none. It is, as Men-
zies says, an “outsider”, a friendly “out-
sider” but a complete “outsider” as far
as the Parliamentary wing of the Liberal
Party is concerned. Where the ALP
machine can impose its will upon the
Labor Party’s parliamentary members,
Menzies, who is the creator of the Liberal
Party, has seen to it that the Liberal
machine under his regime has possessed
nothing larger than “persuasive” powers.
On this assessment of the power of
the machine vis-a-vis the parliamentary
wing, it would appear superficially that
the contest between Mr J. E. (Jock)
Pagan, president of the NSW Liberal
Party and Mr R. G. Withers, president
of the West Australian Liberal Party,
for the Federal presidency was a strug-
gle for a post which carries only a title
and a certain prestige.
But the post which Mr Pagan won
is important for two reasons. In the
first place what the Liberals describe as
the “persuasive” influence of the
machine should not be discounted.
Parliamentarians are not supermen. They
tend to run out of ideas. They want to
stay in office or if in opposition to get
into office. They need a reservoir of
ideas upon which to draw when their
own are exhausted and an organisation
against which they can test their own
assessment of “grass roots” feelings
Under the Liberal Party set-up—and
backed by a seemingly .efficient research
organisation the Parliamentary wing
is fed ideas from the organisation and
through the innumerable resolutions
some hostile, some friendly that are
processed upwards.
These factors make the “persuasive”
influence of the machine and its major
spokesman the Federal president
considerable, particularly if the Parlia-
mentary wing can be convinced that
the machine is correctly interpreting
the mood or viewpoint of the electorate
or party membership.
Then there is that important matter
money. There seems reasonable grounds
for believing a Liberal claim that by
bringing a professional approach to the
techniques of electioneering, they have
virtually halved their election costs in
the last decade. One estimate is thati
they got out of the last Federal election/
for between £lOO,OOO and £120,000 inf
purely party spending which is probably!
less than half what the election cost!
Labor. But even so they - or at least;
sections of the party —are chronically;
short of money.
The NSW Liberal Party is reputed to 1
be operating on an overdraft and other!
State Liberal organisations grumble
endlessly about the paucity of funds,
Admittedly the Liberals last week
opened a £65,000 neo-Georgian Federal!
headquarters in Canberra. But Sir Philip
Mcßride, the retiring Federal Liberal'
president, seemed to indicate that thef
funds for the building had been raised;
by a special drive. Mr Reg Ansett, head;
of the Ansett-ANA airline which gets
much of its financial security from
legislation passed by the Menzies
Government, was among the guests.
The Deputy Labor Leader in thej
Senate, Senator Kennedy, underlined Mi
Ansett's presence in a question next day
to the Civil Aviation Minister Senator!
Ffenty. With his tongue right into his!
cheek he asked, “As Mr Ansett wasj
present would it be right to assume, as!
most people now believe, that since he;
holds a first mortgage on the Civil
Aviation Department his donation gives!
him a second mortgage on the depart-
ment?”
This money problem gives the presi-
dent an importance secondary only to
the “persuasive” influence.
Thus the emotionalists and smaller!
States wanted the younger West Aus-i
tralian Withers as the new president.
The “harder heads”, including Menzies
and Mcßride, wanted Pagan for a
variety of reasons, including the fact
that he is able, from NSW which i*|
after all the largest State and returns!
the most members to the House off
Representatives.
But an additional reason they wanted
him was because Pagan, well-known,!
prominent all his life in charitable and
other work and with wide contacts in
Sydney and Melbourne would provide;
more prestige for political fund-raisersi.
than a comparative unknown front’
Bunbury remote from the centres of
intense political activity and the majo
sources of political funds.

TRADE
A China Lobby?
Sir Robert Menzies had recently de-
dared that Australia was technically at
war with Communist China. How then,
asked Sir Wilfred Kent-Hughes in the
House of Representatives last week, did
the Prime Minister reconcile this with the
fact that Australia was still selling large
quantities of wheat to China?
The Prime Minister resisted the temp-
tation to point out that the fact is that
the facts very rarely tell the whole truth,
and also failed to give his usual reply to
this question: that the Government either
could not or did not interfere with the
Wheat Board and its decisions. For the
first time Sir Robert indicated that
this was an important question which he
would like to think over before answer,
ing.
This is the first indication the Govern-
ment has given that it is not completely
at ease with the Wheat Board’s dealings
with China. The word is that some
Government members have been dis,
turbed by two developments. The first!
is the claim that has been made by|
some New South Wales millers and
others that Australia may have to import
wheat next year; the second is the allega-
tion that the Wheat Board contains mem- !
bers who are developing into a small but
influential pro-China lobby.
Those who have circulated the
rumors that we may have to import l
Canadian wheat have omitted to mention
that this unlikely event would have'
nothing to do with our sales to China'
The possibility of importing wheat front
Canada is a separate issue from thel
question of trade with China. If the!
hard wheats, produced in northern NSW
and Queensland, are not available foil
the quality breads baked in Sydney and
Melbourne, it may be necessary to
import then. Such imports would be
comparatively tiny.
The allegations that some members of
the Wheat Board have more than com-
mercial sympathies with China are based
mainly on reports of talks which some
of them have given in country districts
abouf the achievements of Mao’s regime
and its friendly attitude to Australia
and Australian trade. Anti-Communists
at some of these talks have become dis-
turbed and have communicated theirj
disturbance to a number of Government!
members. I
More important in terms of national*
security is the fact that
increasing dependence on exports to
China means that we are creating our,
own large China lobby amongst the bulk
of politically unsophisticated wheat,
growers. Few farmers may be expectedj
to have a sound practical knowledge,
of the history of Communist international
blackmail and the use of trade for
political purposes. Until China actually
attempts to use the commercial weapon
to intvaence Australian political decisions
most farmers will presumably take the]
view that the money is worth the risk.
Of the estimated 200 million bushel
harvest for this season (a drop on last
year’s record 370 million bushels),
120 million bushels would be left after 1
our home consumption of 80 milliohi
Since our exports to “traditional” markets
such as England and Japan usually amount
to 120 million bushels it has been sugj
gested that rather than interfere with
this trade the Wheat Board might dif
into the silos of wheat normally user
for home r sumption in order to cor
tinue p -,jort to China. The suggests
made with renewed emphasis whe


the Wheat Board last week announced
'that it had just completed a 20 million
bushel deal with China worth £l3
million.
, Despite the Wheat Board’s persistent
claim that the China market is really
a “surplus market”, the facts are that
Australian wheat acreage has doubled
in the last ten years and that most of
this increased acreage is devoted to grow-
ing wheat for China. But the Wheat
Board claims that its business is eco-
nomic and not political.
So it is the Federal Government which
■ must face the question of whether it
can allow a pro-China lobby to be
'fostered at the very time when Aus-
tralian troops are technically at war with
China. Chou En-lai has already pointed
out that Australia’s commitment in
Vietnam will be considered when future
Australian wheat imports are negotiated.
The real solution to the Government’s
difficulties is not, of course, to cease
all trade with China but to attempt
to reduce the dependence of Australian
wheat-grow'ing on the Chinese market.
To reduce this dependence a great deal
of economic re-thinking and planning
would be necessary. It may be serious
for Australia if such action proves
beyond the capabilities and resources
of the Government; it certainly appears
to be beyond the capabilities and
inclinations of the Wheat Board.

Hex at Exmouth
) The latest trouble at Western Australia’s North-West Cape strengthens the
■j suspicion that hex marks the spot. The £33 million project to provide a very low
(frequency radio hook-up with the U.S. Navy’s Polaris fleet is many months behind
(schedule and has been costly in money and prestige to everyone concerned with it.
>1)
■ Practically all situations with poten-
tial for conflict have created conflict;
the newest is the culmination of long-
term trouble between the prime con-
ilractors Hardentan - Monier - Hutcherson
; and Datronics Engineers. Datronics, a
s [US concern, is responsible for all above-
-ground work on the 13 radio towers,
a [each of them taller than the Eiffel Tower.
s j On such a job this is the biggest
[■jUS Navy project outside America —
l[ b)me clashes are inevitable. Not only are
Vl ; / a number of nationalities involved, but
there are different “species” within each
alpational group the ground-level civil
Engineers and workmen, the caterers and
oservice * personnel, the “construction
JLstiffs” who drift from project to project,
We Navy people themselves, and the
al 'j)rima donnas of the whole show . . .
steel-nerved men who work on the
of the towers.
From all this, trouble has come o
nr
North-West Cape in three sizes
political, industrial and financial. And
while it would be easy to guess that
political trouble on such a project might
be the most crippling, and perhaps trig-
ger the other types this has not been •
the case. There were top-level discus-
sions early in the piece about what coun-
try and what services should have access
to the communications centre. But the
most bitter and recent political clashes
ironically have been between the Com-
monwealth and West Australian Govern-
ments over the use of money being put
up on a £l-for-£l basis.
The Commonwealth felt the State was
over-doing it with swimming pools, air-
conditioning and other amenities for the
fast-growing town, which will be adminis-
tered by joint Austraiian-American con-
trol. But the project is in an area wbh
nothing at all in the way of natural
amenities, and particularly with U.S.
Navy people living there the State
felt the facilities were not excessively
luxurious.
Industrial unrest had started even be-
fore the project was started. The W.A.
Trades and Labor Council in May,
1963, compiled a booklet setting out its
log of working conditions which it put
before the firms tendering for what was
then thought to be rich contracts. This
was seen as presumptuous, perhaps, but
not sinister, and since then the area was
relatively quiet industrially, at least until
the financial worries began.
The Nevada corporation of Paul Har-
deman last year underwent a massive
financial reorganisation. Following a
£9,000.000 loss it was unable to guaran-
tee its Australian commitments as its
contract demanded. So the Monier arm
of the international troika took over this
responsibility, at a time when the pro-
ject was said to be months behind
schedule (though the central pivot of the
complex, Tower Zero, was finished a
month ahead of time.) Meanwhile
G. H. Reid Constructions claimed that
£BO.OOO of their £312,000 losses for the
year was accountable to North-West
Cape, and more recently Datronics sued
the prime contractors for £198.000 for
delays and what it claims to be added
losses.
When progress payments stopped com-
ing through Datronics was unable to
meet its commitments and some of its
men were not paid This provoked the
area’s quote of the year: “There are not
many who want to work at 1000 ft in
the air for bouncing cheques.”
The Austraiian-American teams of
“iron workers” on the high towers have
been paid particularly high wages for
their horrifying work, the Australians
usually getting above-award rates that
bring their levels close to the Americans’.
But last vveek, when the prime con-
tractors took over the company “to ac-
complish the performance obligation of
Datronics under their sub-contract”

some of the Australians who had been
getting more than £2OO a week for close
to an 80-hour week were trimmed back
to a 60-hour week and award rates of
14/- an hour.
But on top of this, while the project
is half-finished, there is already talk in
the area that it is redundant, that satel-
lite communications will make fixed cen-
tres like North-West Cape’s useless, and
that the job is being finished only to
fulfil a contract with the Commonwealth

mony in an already-turbulent area.
DON LIPSCOMBE
EDUCATION
The P M’s School Speech
By providing capital finance for independent schools in the ACT and the Northern
Territory, the Federal Government has strengthened the ALP’s demands for a govern-
ment inquiry as a basis for co-ordinating Commonwealth efforts in primary and;
secondary education.
Within 24 hours of the Prime Minis-
ter’s announcement, the New South
Wales Liberal Premier, Mr R. W. Askin,
gave a broad and it is believed well-
based hint that his Government would
give the new principle consideration. This
will be the hope of Catholics: they will
anticipate that the Commonwealth’s new
policy on capital finance will be the pre-
cursor of extended aid benefits through-
out Australia as were the Common-
wealth’s interest subsidies for independent
schools in the two territories, which it
introduced a decade ago.
The Prime Minister’s announcement
was adroitly timed. This is the season of
end-of-the-year school speeches. Catho-
lic parents everywhere are most likely to
rally with the hope that their present in-
tolerable burden of attempting their own
complete school system will be eased by
fresh aid. The Church’s troubled adminis-
trators, clergy and religious, will receive
their own special filip of optimism be-
cause funds for capital expansion are
their crucial problem.
There is no Catholic diocese in Austra-
lia, even with the Commonwealth’s
science block programme, and other ex-
tensive aid measures, scholarships, text-
book subsidies, and the rest, for which
the present scheme of things is of more
than marginal help. Now, they have the
prospect of direct aid which would be
of central importance. Only a prospect,
the Commonwealth move is yet of tre-
mendous political weight.
The Minister in charge of Common-
wealth activities in education, Senator
Gorton, who is heading a steadily grow-
ing preserve, has explained that the new
Commonwealth scheme will cover inde-
pendent school buildings in the ACT to
the value of £1,500,000 in the next five
years. In each case where assistance is
given the Commonwealth will need to be
satisfied about the standards of construc-
tion and borrowing arrangements. The
Commonwealth will make its capital
repayments in equal annual instalments
over a period of 20 years.
The Catholic Administrator of the
Canberra and Goulburn Archdiocese,
Monsignor Favier, spelt out in concrete
terms what this would mean to Catholic
schools in Canberra when he said last
week that but for the new assistance the
Church would have had to drastically
curtail a £1,800,000 programme in newi
areas. It is understood that as long agol-
as 12 months Canberra Catholic authori-j
ties had detailed their crisis situation toj
the Prime Minister’s Department in thq
hope of additional assistance.
Judged by the harsh political facts of
life the Leader of the Opposition, Mr)
Calwell, blundered last week when, im-i
mediately on hearing the Prime. Minister’s!
announcement, he asked that the questioij
be put on the notice paper for debat|
at a later date. Given the present conj
fusion in the Labor Party on the Aid
issue, the Government would make grand
capital from a Parliamentary debate.'
Labor tacticians are hopeful that the
Government’s heavy programme of legis
lative business will postpone the fata
day, and there is some optimism that a
meeting of the Federal executive, ex
pected early in the new year, will taki
Labor off the hook by remedying the
ambiguities in the policy as “defined” at !
the August Federal Conference meeting
in Sydney.
Of course, the tragedy is that element!
in Labor’s education policy are far-!
sighted, imaginative and practical fo|
example its demand for a comprehensive!
educational inquiry. However re-assurin|
they are to Catholics,, the Common
wealth’s series of ad hoc decisions -
particularly because they can and
reasonably expected to be taken as pre-[
cedents by the States —are by no mean
self-evidently the most economic course
Labor’s suggestion, for instance, ol
shared facilities between State and inde->
pendent schools, which has worked suc-l
cessfully in the United States, is the
only one of the alternatives meriting!
consideration.
Ironically, the increased Common-
wealth activity in aid to independent;
schools comes at a time when Catholics?
themselves are not only examining the
practicality of maintaining an alternate
system, but are in fact re-examining tin
very principles involved. Nevertheless
there is absolute certainty that Catholic;'
will welcome every scrap of addition*
aid at the present time. But taking th<
long view it could well be that new Con
monwealth handouts might only be tl
means of prolonging a state of educ
tional mendicancy.

graduates and Customs officers sees
every theatrical feature film entering the
from abroad and every film,
programme or series imported for
television, except where the material
is obviously going to be “harmless”
(“spot" viewing is permitted for some
cartoon, educational or children’s series).
A team of deputy censors reviews the
vast mass of non-theatrical films entering
the country: tourist, advertising, in-
| dustrial, religious and other pictures
predominant among them. The sheer
effort of sitting through, say, a whole
hatch of The Patty Duke Show or The
Loretta Young Show—scores of hours of
unadulterated goo doesn’t faze the
resolute panel of custodians: “We roster
the work, of course.” The TV studios
have certain days for viewing, and are
.said occasionally to dodge a censor they
ure nervous of: the ABC, for instance,
hus been said to be wary of Miss Mc-
Millan, whose scissors are reputedly par-
ncularly sharp-edged.
For medical, educational and other
specialised films, experts are called in.
One importer of foreign films is con-
vinced that “religious advice” the
counsel of a priest—was called on when
he imported a picture about nuns some
time back. “In some cases,” Prowse says,
“a doctor might indicate that we are
only allowed to license a certain picture
for medical study. Those step-by-step
details of operations can be pretty bad,
you know.”
T'he Customs Department issues certifi-
A cates of registration to importers,
indicating the footage, production com-
pany and number of reels. Typed in
under the heading “Not Suitable for
Children”, specific cuts might be in-
dicated. Examples from the certificate
on “The Confessions of Ina Kahr”, a
German film imported by Nathan
Scheinwald, are: “Delete double bed
sequences so that the wife walks into
the scene of her husband asleep with the
girl sitting to one side, putting on her
shoes”, and “Delete hand on breast
sequence”, and, in “Women by Night”,
“Delete all suggestive movements of
strip-tease puppet”.
In “Two Men in a Wardrobe”: “Delete
shot of lout throwing the dead cat”, and
in “The Unknown Soldier”: “Delete
caption and dialogue “lcb babe beinahe
die Hosen beschissen”.
What about letting films through for
film societies and festivals? Wasn’t
there a case for giving them special
privileges as in England, letting them
show material uncut? “No. You must
remember a film festival is not just for
a small section of the community. It is
open to all sections. Many thousands of
people go to these festivals.
“And many of the films are of a type
which can be shown commercially. I
don’t think the public would like it .'f
a film could be shown to one section of
the community and not another. We
can’t make a double rule, you see.”
Horror films, of course, had been
banned for years, hadn’t they? “Yes. We
don’t like them at all. I think the com-
plete banning of them has taken place
since about 1956. The then Chief Censor
made inquiries from several people
including the heads of the various motion
picture companies and an agreement
was drawn up between all concerned in-
dicating that it would be better if this
kind of thing were kept out of the
country.” Under what regulation were
the films banned? “Undesirable in the
public interest.” There had, Mr Prowse
said, been no special clause inserted into
the regulations covering horror films.
“The then Minister for Customs simply
agreed to this banning being done.”
What else did the Board object to?
“Smashing men’s faces, kicks to the nuts,
blows to the stomach, that kind of stuff.
Flick-knives? A prohibited import to
this country, so we don’t allow them to
be shown. Here are some typical ex-
amples of the kind of thing we throw
out.” Mr Prowse brought in a folder
containing long lists of television series
with cuts of kicks, stabs, beatings,
gougings, and so on. Obviously these cuts
were made with children in mind: Mr
Prowse said that there would be far
fewer such cuts in theatres if children
under 16 could be legally forbidden to
see them, as in other countries.
Were charges made to distributors for
the viewing of their films? “We charge
five bob a reel for the first viewing fee
and nothing a reel for the appeal,
although we do charge a three guinea
deposit before the appeal is considered.”
(This statement was sharply denied by
the distributor, Nathan Scheinwald, who
claimed that he was charged 15s. a reel
for a first submission and 30s. a reel for
the appeal.) And why weren’t lists of
banned films issued? Why, in fact, had
the public never been told what films
had been banned? “/ don’t keep the
details a secret. This information is con-
fidential between me and the distributor,
but I don’t have any objection to supply-


ing this information if the distributor j s j
willing.”
Earlier, the distributors of films ex.
cepting independents like Nathan Schein.
wald and Sidney Blake had referred
me to the censor for these lists, some in-
dicating that he might not approve of
their supply. Somewhere, somehow, a
misunderstanding had grown up (and a ;
further appeal to the film companies-j
backed by the censor’s approval—im-
mediately produced a selected list). It
is a list that pinpoints many areas of
disapproval over the last 37 years.
J
present censorship set-up officially
began in 1928 when, as a result of;
special Commission on the film industry
a board was established in its presenl
Bligh Street, Sydney, headquarters. Aftej
1932 there was only one Appeal Censor;
replacing a previous Board of Appeal,:
More than 1000 people applied for the!
positions of censors w'hen they were first
advertised One paper of the time wrote?
‘They have scrambled for the jobs!
brazenly pulling every wire-pulling stunf
in their powers.” The Chief Censor was!
Cresswell O'Reilly, a Methodist lay
preacher who had been a member of the
Department of Justice, Treasurer ol
Wesley College, and. like Mr Robin of
the present board. Mayor of Kuring-gai,
He was paid a salary ol £3 a day, and
spoke to women s clubs on his personal
tastes: “If it is a Mae West or a Greta'
Garbo picture we all at censorship go;
and see it ” (This enthusiasm did not.
prevent him from banning a Mae Wesf
picture, “Klondike Annie”, in 1936.1
“We want to see the picture from thi
official point of view, of course,” hi
added waggishly to the members of thi
Nellie Stewart Memorial Club. Some-
thing of his skill in cutting silent films,
was indicated to the members: “Therei
was a silent film in which the man andjj
the woman Tved together for the first
half of the picture wihout benefit of a
marriage ceremony. It was a simpli
matter to transpose the wedding cere-
mony from the latter to the first half of.
the picture.”
O’Reilly’s bugbears included Holly-
wood social melodramas (“Why should
dirty American linen be washed in the
presence of Australian audiences?” he
asked, in a characteristic annual report)
and stories of illicit intercourse: ‘'The.
continued repetition of the mistress!

(Eight be London matinee idols, but they

customed to the bronzed and statuesque
physique of the beaches,” he thundered.
O’Reilly hated talkies as a whole: “The
'soul of the film was its eloquent and vital
[silence. The old mystery and beauty are
going away . .itisto be hoped that
ithe silent film will not yet lapse into the
limbo of things forgotten.” He disliked
the chorus-girl pictures of the period:
|“A visitor from another planet might
’draw the conclusion thqt the most absorb-
ing interest to the modern mind was to
[see ballet girls dressing and undressing
backstage.” No doubt it was this dislike
of chorines that induced O’Reilly to ban
Rouben Mamoulian’s masterpiece “Ap-
plause”, set partly behind the scenes of
% seedy New York cabaret-show in 1930.
O’Reilly’s attacks on British bodies and
American accents caused much local
disapproval in the early ’thirties, but the
at was really in the fire when he said
n one report: “British films are generally
lelow the standard of technical excel-
lence and entertainment value attained
)y foreign films ... the best examples
if English life depicted have been made
n America.” This remark caused a
furious reaction in Britain, especially
jlince it followed on a host of bannings
Iff British International pictures. The
of British Industries lodged
jiffl official protest with the Dominions
secretary in London, Edgar Wallace,
Jfirectors Herbert Wilcox and Anthony
Asquith dismissed O'Reilly’s remarks as
‘nonsense”, and the London Press made
lay with the incident. It was hinted that,
tecause Australian films got a bad show-
ng in England, O'Reilly was wreaking
revenge . . .
At a special Presbyterian General
(Wssembly in Australia, a Church elder,
C. Seaward, told all present that the
SWef Censor was not —as charged
nti-British at all. “The fact that he
Qlisted as a married man with three
[*oimg children speaks for itself. It is
fco said that he is a Caesar. He is not.”
.H the Baptists’ Union also met to com-
ifend the work of “Mr Dowell (sic)
|Reilly”.
=| While this controversy was still raging,
)lOßeilly got into even hotter water on
subject of Australian films. He
sßatened to ban the hayseed comedies
popular at the time (“Dad and Dave”,
| c -) on the grounds they were damaging
f e Australian image abroad. Charles
fhauvel’s “In the Wake of the Bounty”
A/ * tS sem *' nu de Tahitian dancers, while
• "ken the Kellys Rode” was banned
J ut nght in NSW. “The Silence of Dean
Jutland” lost, for export, one scene in
P lc h the Dean is vamped and another
showing a girl (presumably of “bronzed
and statuesque physique”) in a bathing
costume on a beach. All suggestions in
Australian films of an awkward past were
excised. “Convicts,” wrote the trade
magazine “Everyone’s” of these films,
“were cuddled, not flogged.” A film
called “His Royal Highness” became
“His Loyal Highness” for England, lest
the British monarch should think Aus-
tralia uppity.
Tn 1932 a notable incident took place
when police swooped on Sydney
theatres and seized newsreels containing
shots of De Groot’s famous Harbor
Bridge ride. Reaction to the police’s
arrival in the city’s cinemas varied
according to the class status of the sub-
urb, apparently. “Against the cheers of
Chatswood were the raspberries of Red-
fern,” wrote “Everyone's”. Several com-
mentators of the time took this act of
political censorship—at a time when The
New Guard was at the eye of a whirl-
wind of controversy rather more
seriously.
Another political row took place in
1936 when the Eisenstein Russian classic
“Ten Days that Shook the World”
imported by Communists—was banned
in Victoria. The Council for Civil
Liberties in Melbourne disclosed in its
report that Cresswell O’Reilly, acting in
his capacity as Chief Censor for Vic-
toria, had banned the film in their State
but, as Commonwealth Censor, had let
it into the others. After several attempts
the Council members finally managed
to see the Chief Secretary in Melbourne.
“Films released for the Commonwealth
will be released in Victoria,” he
promised.
Later, political censorship (of a kind)
prohibited the importing of a Warner
Brothers comedy, “The King and the
Chorus Girl”, because of supposed
parallels with the Duke of Windsor
story, and even of a film showing the
Duke ski-ing in Austria. And at the out-
break of war, O'Reilly ordered two
pacifist films in circulation for years
“All Quiet on the Western Front” and
“The Road Back”, both from Remarque

The catch in driving a Rover 2000 for the
first time is that you have no impression of
speed. We suggest you watch this factor
for the first few days or you’re likely to find
the needle constantly over the legal limit.
This feeling of tranquillity at speed is in-
duced by a multiplicity of factors, most of
them quite revolutionary: The complete
car was designed around radial cord tyres
which offer vastly improved roadholding
and safety. The suspension is such that
Car and Driver magazine says, “it will out-

eration can be fierce (0-100 m.p.h. in 45
seconds), you’re cradled in bucket seats
that support you in the small of the back
like no others in the automotive world.
Back seat passengers feel disinclined to
“drive” because they, too, have bucket
seats. Instead of the conventional glove
box, there are tilt out bins for driver and*

protect knees, but are also designed to

j n 1940 “Comrade X”, a comedy satiris-
ing Russia, was banned as likely to be
offensive to a friendly nation, although
a similar spoof, “Ninotchka”, was avail-
able. But most of his objections at the
time were to Warner crime pictures,
especially those starring James Cagney,
and “Each Dawn I Die”, “The Fighting
69th” bit the dust.
; In 1942 O’Reilly retired, to be re-
placed by John Alexander, a teetotaller
i an d cricket fan with a long record of
[public service. For the rest of the war
[years only a handful of films was
banned. But in 1948 the most significant
[change that had taken place in censor-
ship since the ’thirties occurred: horror
Ifilms began to be clamped down on. In
that year Alexander said: “Horror films
are neither entertaining nor cultural.
They cater only for a small minority of
The moronic type.” (He thereby cheer-
fully ignored the considerable reputation
many horror films have among connois-
seurs, from Fritz Lang’s Mabuse series
to the James Whale films at Universal
and the Val Lewton productions at
RKO.) Alexander also said that he
banned shots of bikinis because they
[were forbidden on the beaches, that too
jmany kisses on the neck went out be-
jcause “you don’t want to make a welter
if it, audiences get tired of it”, and that
lie had removed the word “too” from a
jtemark of the Queen Mother’s, looking
[{a Red Cross silk shawl for poor child-
m in a wartime film: “It is really too
beautiful.” “We eliminated the word to
/avoid the impression on some minds with
lan exaggerated social outlook that the
pueen’s remark suggested the shawl was
(oo good for a working-man’s child.”
Perhaps the most widely publicised
I episode of John Alexander’s reign was
i |le banning of Rossellini’s “The
t Miracle”, in 1952 (although an almost
jsqual fuss was caused by the prohibiting
j pf the celebrated film “Seashell and the
. Clergyman” some years earlier to all
j wept students, with the additional,
j jjiroviso that a psychiatrist must explain

feld, to get a reconstructed version
trough, failed. (Later the film was

fame by another distributor, Errol
P e ath: Mr Scheinwald is still furious
» 69 *bout this.)
The banning by Alexander of Charles
Laughton’s celebrated film “Night of the
Hunter” and its further banning by him
when he became Appeals Censor, caused
no less unfavorable comment. By the
time he changed jobs in 1956 Alexander
was already a thoroughly embattled
figure.
Another veteran public servant, Colin
Campbell, arrived as censor in that year,
when television was being launched here,
and remained censor until 1964. Almost
at once the Broadcasting Control Board
and the censor between them clamped
down firmly on scenes of violence and
horror on the idiot box. Films shown in
theatres intact were suddenly deprived
of face-slappings, knifings, kicks and
various kinds of torture for TV. Films
or episodes of series or programmes
with a strongly adult flavor were
relegated to late night time-slots. “The
Outer Limits” and “Thriller” a
science fiction and Gothic horror series
respectively—were shown at the child-
ren’s hours in America for ratings pur-
poses and died the death when they
were switched to “adult” time-slots; here
they could only be shown on adult slots.
The ABC began to exercise its own
internal censorship, banning, for in-
stance, “That Was The Week That Was”
(although only too pleased to show it to
its staff). Episodes of “Z Cars” marked
“Adults Only” by the censor are also
said to have been prohibited (by agree-
ment with the BBC). And, of course,
the ABC censored (in a notorious in-
cident) its own “Four Corners” when
it ventured on the subject of capital
punishment. Today, the ABC still re-
fuses to disclose details of bannings,
despite the censor’s willingness to release
the information on the say-so of dis-
tributors.
ATN lost three episodes in the British
“This Week” series: on purple-heart pills,
homosexuality and lesbianism, as well as
many single episodes of American series,
including 12 from the Alfred Hitchcock
series (an adaptation of Michael Aden’s
“Gentleman from America” among them).
Also banned were one episode from, of
all things, “The Jane Wyman Theatre”,

While the binary code may seem a bit
awkward to those who are used to the decimal
system, it is simplicity itself to the computer.
This is because the basic electronic parts
inside the computer can exist in only two
possible states: current is on or off, a switch
is opened or closed, magnetic materials are
magnetized in one direction or the opposite.
You must understand binary before learning
how a computer works. But, thanks to some
new short-cut methods called symbolic
languages you no longer use the binary code
yourself when you talk with a computer.
There's nothing hard about symbolic
languages. Most of us hear some kind of
symbolic language every day. You might for
instance walk into a restaurant and ask for a
glass of milk only to have the waitress call for
"one cow”, or perhaps translate someone's
order of a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich
on toast as , J B LTdown * ' Restaurant workers t
“'"precise.’ Computer programmers use special
codes for the same reasons, and because they
make it very easy to use the computer. Until a
few years ago, if you wanted a computer to add
something, you might have typed an instruction
like this: 1011010111010001. Today, you can
merely type in the symbol for "add” and the
computer will automatically translate "add”
into the correct binary instruction.
Today almost anyone can quickly learn to
use a computer, thanks to symbolic language.
In an hour West Point cadets learn enough of
their special POINTRAN language to operate a
computer. Other special languages, such as
FORTRAN, COBOL and ALGOL, make it easy for
businessmen, scientists, and engineers to write
programs, using words and symbols they are
used to.

After a program is~ written m symbolic
language, it is automatically translated into
binary code, known as "machine language".
The computer can automatically do this because
somebody previously had written a special
program called an assembler that converts
other people's symbolic programs into machine
language. Once the symbolic program has been
converted to binary, it can move as electronic
pulses into the computer's memory,

and one from “The Loretta Young
Show”, eight from “Medic”, one from,
incredibly, “Our Gang”, one from Roy
Rogers, two from “The Three Stooges”
—“Outer Space Jitters” and “Spooks”—
and five from the splendid “Thriller”
series: “A Third for Pinochle”, “The
Return of Andrew Bentley”, “The Hol-
low Watcher”, “The Incredible Dr
Markesan”, and “Kill My Love”.
TEN has lost “almost nothing”, but
violence has been the objection to the
tiny handful of features and episodes it
has had cut since its recent commence-
ment.
In recent years the two most famous
film rejections have been “Viridiana”
Luis Bunuel’s ferocious attack on
religion, banned on the ground of
blasphemy and Jean-Luc Godard’s
“Breathless”, internationally acclaimed a
masterpiece (the film is now in the
country with a dubbed sound-track; the
censor originally objected to certain
captions which, he\ claimed, were “in-
decent” in conjunction with the images;
the importer, Robert Kapferer, refused
to alter the film). Other much publicised
censorial episodes have been the banning
of a film about Aboriginals, “Children
of the Wasteland”, as being injurious to
the Australian image, and the classifica-
tion as unsuitable for juveniles of “Oliver
Twist”, on the grounds that it showed
pocket-picking methods.
An examination of the banned list in
recent years shows a preponderance of
horror films, mostly of a crude and
worthless type. Nevertheless, the large
number of cuts in films of quality is what
disturbs most critics of censorship; and
if the major film companies are happy
with censorship since the war, Nathan
Scheinwald, for one, is not.
“Early in my career as an importer
here, I was thrown out of his office by
Mr Alexander,” Scheinwald told me.
“He had cut some bullfighting scenes
from a film version of ‘Carmen’ 1 had
imported. I said to him, ‘Foreigners
should not interfere with the customs of
certain countries.’ He said, drawing him-
self up to his full height, ‘Mr Scheinwald,
I am the Chief Commonwealth Censor.
I say that bullfighting is unacceptable
here and I don’t take any notice of what
other countries do.' Then he ordered me
out.
“I’m sure religious bodies put pressure
on the censor to ban my The Miracle’.
My film ‘The Devil and the Nun’” a
Polish production about the possession
of a group of nuns by demoniacal forces
“was held up for 12 weeks by the
censor. He didn’t understand the logic
of the film, or its philosophy.
“Mr Campbell said to me, ‘What are
the nuns saying in Latin?’ He was
obviously suspicious of them. I said,
‘Mr Campbell, they're praying!’ He was
still doubtful, and had a translation done
of the Latin. I’m sure they used a priest
before they finally passed the picture.”
More recently Mr Scheinwald has been
fighting a bitter battle to have a nudist
film, “Naked as Nature Intended”,
passed by the censor.
IY/lany students of the cinema here share
Mr Sheinwald’s view that the
censor shows a nervous prurience to-
wards scenes of sex, and that the con-
tinuity of many good films is ruined by
his interference. Among films of merit
cut by the censor, they list “Woman in
the Dunes”, “Don’t Shoot the Pianist”
“Los Olvidados”, “Bread and Circuses”,
“Les Amants”, “The Trial”, “The Virgin
Spring”, “The Silence” and “Olivia”.
The censor would claim that present
regulations make such cuts inevitable:
since any one of these films can be shown
to children under 16, and the law is
designed to protect these children (rightly
or wrongly), the censor has no option but
to cut where restrictions are called for.

One sympathises with the censor’s
problems, especially in a period when
the last barriers have broken down
against the disclosure of rape, homo-
sexuality, masturbation and lesbianism
on the screen. In other countries, the
“X” certificate excludes younger
audiences, but here there is no “X”
certificate; its immediate introduction
would seem to be pressing, although one
sees that this might seriously affect the
business ot some distributors in some
cases. Without an “X” certificate, cut-
tings will continue, and some of these are
probably justified.
Where criticism of the censor seems
apt, though, is in the business of his
secrecy over lists of banned films, and
in the misleading screenings of cut films
to journalists. Banned lists should cer-
tainly appear in the censor’s annual re-
ports; the one rational objection to the
suppy of this information—that the film
companies would not approve of it
disappears forever with this week’s issue
of The Bulletin, and its lists of
censored films supplied by the companies
themselves.
The screenings of banned material are
dishonest because they are not intro-
duced with precise information on the
names of the films cut. It should be
pointed out by the censor that in some
cases these are films of merit cut accord-
ing to the regulations: the suggestion that
only material of a pornographic kind is
prohibited is totally indefensible. If a
portion of the rape from “The Virgin
Spring" is cut it should be described as
coming from that film, one of Ingar
Bergman’s most celebrated works. And
the precise reasons for the removalcof the
shots of the men mounting the woman
should be given, to quell any possible
criticism that the suggestion of rape in
the film as now released is stimulating,
whereas its disclosure by Bergman shows
the act as disgusting and horrible, and
therefore serves a better moral purpose.
In other words, the present censor,
like his counterpart in Britain, Mr Trevel-
yan, must be compelled, as a public
servant, to make public defence of his
policy. We are willing to believe, as
many industry representatives claim,
that he is a more enlightened man than
any of his predecessors, but we need
the evidence of this in a more open
revelation of his attitudes and methods.
Given this, we may feel that censorship
has indeed come some way from Cress-
well O’Reilly’s obsession with British
Physiques, American accents, the horrors
the talkies, and the habits of chorus
girls.


NEW YORK LETTER
In the Light
of the Moon
Black Tuesday
From GEORGE MCGANN
The practice of “moonlighting”
doubling-up jobs in order to keep
up with the Joneses—is said to be a
rapidly growing American phenomenon.
But the big blackout of last week made
moonlighters of us all even those
scraping by on one job. The lucky hap-
penstance of a gorgeously brilliant new
moon sailing high in an early autumn
sky enabled me to carry on throughout
that long, long night. When the lights
dimmed, flickered, and died at 5.28
o’clock on Tuesday evening and the
Associated Press teletypewriter machines
stuttered and subsided into a last hope-
less jumble of fouled-up words, our
offices six storeys above Times Square
would have been pitch-black without
those providential patches of moonshine
at each window. By this light I was able
to carry on for the next ten hours.
Like nine out of ten New York offices
ours was totally unprepared for the
blight of darkness, lacking torches or
candles or similar emergency lighting-
equipment. As a non-smoker, I didn’t
even have matches at hand.
The moonlight helped to allay the
panic that never came in the streets
thronged with people homeward-bound
from their offices and it contributed to
the amazingly orderly flow of motor-cars,
despite the absence of traffic lights and
adequate police direction. If it had been
a dark, rainy or even snowy night
no rarity at this time of year in New
York —the situation might well have
deteriorated into a major tragedy.
Two other factors worked throughout
the night to help calm the public’s fears
the superbly functioning telephone
system and the equally superb transis-
tor-radio supply of news and vital infor-
mation. People were able to communi-
cate with each other by telephone, be-
leaguered as they might have been in
offices such as ours with lifts out of
operation, and they gained enormous re-
assurance from the quickly expanded
news reports carried on all radio stations.
Wives waiting at home in the dark for
husbands stalled in commuter trains or
underground in subway cars took comfort
in the thought that they were not alone
in their plight. If misery loves company,
it certainly got its fill Tuesday night.
The radio stations discarded all com-
mercials, all rock ’n’ roll records and disc-
jockey wise-cracking, dedicating them-
selves to the performance of a public
service which ought to earn them some
kind of official recognition.
Fortunately the privately owned Bell
telephone system proved to be a shining
example of a properly operated public
utility. It maintained its customary high
level of performance throughout the
emergency, enabling the police, hospitals,
fire brigades, and similar groups to func-
tion with great efficiency. The Bell system
operates on direct current, not the alter-
nating current provided by the main
power company, Consolidated Edison,
and its banks of batteries and standby
generators proved equal to the enormous
load thrust upon them by an avalanche
of phone calls during the night.
Out of the welter of this weird mass
experience, which no one will be able
to grasp fully for a long time, have come
a few immediate impressions. The first
and paramount fact is that the average
New Yorker, a much-maligned individual,
behaved with totally unexpected strength
and dignity. During the London blitz it
used to be said that New York could
never take a bombing raid like the stoic
Londoners that panic, hysteria and
mass chaos would overwhelm this poly-
glot city, supposedly lacking the common
ethnic bond which united Englishmen
under mortal stress. But New York was
a warm, friendly and, above all, a com-
pletely calm city during the night of ten-
sion. My wife drove home in the first
hour of the blackout, across the Queens-
borough Bridge and along choked-up
Queens Boulevard for ten miles to our
house in Forrest Hills. Later she said on
the telephone: “I’ve never experienced
anything like it. No traffic lights, only a
few police and yet every driver was so
careful and polite I couldn’t believe it.
At the main intersections drivers stopped
and let other cars across, then started up
again. And no one honked a horn all
night.” Volunteers, many of them utterly
lacking in such experience, helped direct
traffic with the aid of white handker-
chiefs or hand torches. Drivers obeyed
them gratefully. A noticeable exception
was provided by the many cab-drivers
who refused to accept fares to outlying
districts or extorted double or more than
the meter totals from their passengers.
T ooting and similar depredations never
materialised, not' even in the slums
of Harlem, and in fact the rate of thefts,
muggings and the like declined sharply
during the night.
The air of camaraderie and of sharing
a big human experience reached its most
cheerful expression in the packed-out
bars and restaurants of mid-Manhattan.
Mass singing gave a New Year’s Eve
touch to the candle-lit places where the
grog flowed in holiday quantities. In
Gough’s Bar, a journalists’ pub opposite
the “New York Times” building, an Ame-
rican joined a group of Australian Press-
men weathering the crisis with a few post-
midnight beers. Nodding his head toward
the dark and empty street outside, he
said: “It’s like a scene from ‘On the
Beach’ and here are the Aussies to go
with it.”
In Carnegie Hall, pianist Vladimir
Horowitz carried on for a rehearsal audi-
ence, placing candelabra on his piano to
light up the stage. (Someone of course
said: “Liberace would feel right at
home.”) Even hapless citizens trapped in
lifts and darkened subways retained their
sense of humor. A fireman who reachec
a stalled lift in the Empire State Build-
ing asked: “First of all, are there any
pregnant women in here?” A male voice
responded, “I doubt it we’ve hardly
even met.”
Another and much more sobering im-
pression left by the blackout was of the
frightening technological vulnerability o:
this and other major cities. Not only were
governmental and industry officials with-
out explanation for the unprecedented
massive power stoppage; they were un-
able to promise that it could not happen
again. The intricate, interlocking “grid”
system which binds the various electric
complexes of the north-east was set up
to avoid the precise mass-scale break-
down which occurred last Tuesday night.
Recently the Federal Power Commission
stated that not even nuclear attack woulc
be likely to knock out all the power in
given service area. But in this emergency
whether caused by accident or by sabo
tage —a possibility by no means rulet
out all “foolproof” safety devices
failed.

A Republican Australia
Report on an unfinished book
By GEOFFREY DUTTON
A Bulletin editorial headed “A
Republican Australia”! For a
moment I thought I had been swept
backwards at high speed on a time
machine 70 or 80 years to the Bulletin
which championed a republican Australia
and mercilessly satirised the monarchy.
But the editorial of October 30, 1965
was an impartial and pretty accurate
assessment of Australian attitudes to the
monarch today; the irony was in the
sub-heading, “Or, Back to Queen Vic-
toria.”
Usually one would have about as much
chance of catching trout in Lake Eyre
as finding the serious Press in Australia
discussing republicanism. The future of
the monarchy comes in for a little more
consideration, especially since the an-
nouncement of Prince Charles’ forth-
coming visit to Timbertop (it is too short
to deserve being called “going to school”
there), but such discussions are (signifi-
cantly) usually conducted more with
reference to the United Kingdom than to
Australia. In London, of course, there
is a frankness of discussion about the
monarchy that would appal readers of
the Sydney or Melbourne newspapers; not
only are there bitter opponents of the
institution such as Malcolm Muggeridge
or Lord Altrincham, but there is also
immediate and honest criticism from all
shades of political opinion. In Australia
no one discusses the monarchy as it
applies to Australians. To talk about the
Queen in public is a bit like discussing
your mother in a bar; you may adore
your mother, you may think she is a
dear, dull, old thing, you may think she
is a fiend, an alcoholic or a gambler, but
you just don’t talk about her in public.
Australians, so irreverent according to
the national myth, are in fact dreadfully
conscious of Good Form. Some things
are just Not Done. We are a gentle
people, and this saves us from many
forms of foolishness and violence But
that is no excuse for intellectual laziness,
bad-tempered indignation at the breaking
of taboos, or just plain easygoing in-
difference. She’s right; but there is a
deadly intertia in a perpetual balance.
I am at the moment assembling as
editor, for a new paperback publisher,
a symposium on “Australia and the
Monarchy”. Believing that the subject
needs serious discussion, I asked ten
eminent Australians to contribute. (There
were originally eleven, but one became
so eminent that he had to withdraw.)
Amongst them there is a professor of
law; a scientist; a playwright; a poet;
three editors; journalists and writers.
There are monarchist and republican
points of view presented. Above all, what
is emerging from the as yet uncompleted
book is the very point made by The
Bulletin in its editorial of October 30:
“The one thing that both republicans and
monarchists appear to agree on is their
dissatisfaction with the present state of
Australia.” It is not “disloyal” to discuss
the monarchy and the possibility of a
republican Australia; it is what we should
be doing already, and what our children
should be doing in school.
What in fact they do is every morning
chant their loyalty to the Queen. Our
Prime Minister, in his speech of welcome
to the Queen in 1954 at a banquet at
Parliament House, said: “We are yours.
There is nothing ambiguous about our
loyalty or our will . . . Our children and
our grandchildren will carry on our tradi-
tion, our privilege and our devotion.” The
“Gentlemen! I give you 'Death to the Roundheads!'"
Queen’s title, by legislation in 1953, is
“Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of
God, of the United Kingdom, Australia
and Her other Realms and Territories,
Queen, Head of the Commonwealth,
Defender of the Faith.” Professor Zelman
Cowen points out in his chapter on “The
Constitution and the Monarchy” just how
divisible the Crown has to be in practice,
and he quotes the late Chief Justice of
Australia Sir John Latham, that, “The
principle that the Crown is one and
indivisible is very important and signifi-
cant from a political point of view. But,
when stated as a legal principle, it tends
to dissolve into verbally impressive
mysticism.” The Queen is “Head of the
Commonwealth” because there are re-
publics in the Commonwealth. In the
recent hostilities between India and Paki-
stan there was the surrealist fantasy of a
head at war with itself.
To move from rhetoric and mysticism
to reality, the Queen is an English lady
of German descent. We are an Australian
people of mixed English, Welsh, Scottish,
Irish, European, American and Levantine
descent. Our naturalisation statistics show
that we are composed in 1965 of 28
different nationalities apart from those
already “British” and those Asians who
were here before the White Australia
policy was thought of. Yet when Sir
Robert Menzies talks to the Queen in
Canberra he says, “It is quite simply that
you are in your own country and among
your own people.” In such a complicated
world, can we afford such fairytale
simplicities?
It is typical of our attitude towards
migrants, which is easygoing to the point
of don’t care, that no one has ever
bothered to ask them what they think
of the monarchy. Rohan Rivett, in his
pioneering chapter on “The Monarch
and Migrants”, interviewed a large num-
ber of migrants of many different nation-

alities. He began with the oath of allegi-
ance sworn at the naturalisation cere-
mony: “I . . . (name) . . . swear by Al-
mighty God that I will be faithful and
bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth the Second, her heirs and
successors according to law and that I
will faithfully observe the laws of Austra-
lia and fulfil my duties as an Australian
citizen.” Rivett’s findings amongst the
reactions of migrants to this oath are
extremely interesting. With that notorious
tendency of Europeans towards realism,
they ask why Australia comes second
and the Queen first. For obvious reasons,
migrants mostly do not want to discuss
politics or subjects like the monarchy;
their own counsellors advise them not to.
However, Rivett has
managed to draw
out some opinions,
like that of a Dutch-
man, “Almost all the
Dutch migrants I
know dislike very
much this oath to
the Queen. There
are two separate
reasons for this.
One is personal in
that three Dutch
families I know
simply do not like
the Queen. Yes,
that may sound
strange to an Aus-
tralian. The second
reason is general.
We want to be citizens of Australia.
We do not want to be loyal to the
Queen of England. Always, you know,
we Dutch people have a distrust of
the English. We feel there is a cold-
ness oh, and so much is history. We
like Australia and Australians. We did
not know we had to commit ourselves to
England. It is a barrier for some.”
“To commit ourselves to England.”
This is a problem that most native-born
Australians either ignore or do not
understand. We can ignore it by pretend-
ing that the presence of the Prince of
Wales at the bush outstation of the Eton
of Australia proves that we are one big
happy family, even if some of the cousins
are black, and some of the brown cousins
are bombing each other. We can fail to
understand what we are, and baffle
foreigners at the same time, by presenting
them with a document labelled “AUS-
TRALIA BRITISH PASSPORT”. A
baffled Mexican consular official once
asked me which I was, Australian or
British, as there were different charges
for visas for each nationality.
The Australian attitude towards the
British is bafflingly ambivalent. On the
one hand, Pom-baiting is as venerable a
national sport as two-up, except that
" It's for services to the cause of
Republicanism."
many more people have heard the words
“Bloody Pommy” than ever heard the
cry “Come in, spinner”. Thousands of
Australians wanting to widen their hori-
zons go thousands of miles to Earl’s
Court where they closet themselves with
other Australians in order to grizzle
about the Poms. On the other hand, we
live under English institutions, we ape
English customs and accept English
honors, however farcical or tatty. (That
senile pantomime of the Cinque Ports;
those Orders of the British Empire—what
Empire?) No Australian in his right
mind would want us to be anti-British;
there is infinite good to come from the
relationship, apart from the ties in the
past. But it is imperative that we clear
up, for ourselves
and for the rest of
the world, particu-
larly Asia, the
confusion between
“Australian” and
“British”. Even the
most fanatical Aus-
tralian monarchists
can be found to ad-
mit this. Don Whit-
ington, in his re-
search for his chap-
ter “The Monarchy
and the Liberal
Party”, drew this
very sensible com-
ment from W. C.
Wentworth: “It is
not so very long
ago that most Australians would have
thought of themselves primarily as
British citizens and, secondarily, as
Australian citizens. Today, for most
Australians, we are first Australian citi-
zens, and British in some secondary
sense.”
Our children are brought up in utter
confusion about what is British and what
is Australian. The “National Anthem”
that they sing in the morning was first
rendered by a bunch of actors at Drury
Lane Theatre 43 years before Australia
was settled. They chant, “I salute the
flag”, but when I asked some young
people in my district, in their late teens
and early twenties, what flag it was
they had saluted they said they couldn’t
quite remember, but sometimes it was
the British and sometimes our flag, they
thought. One girl said, “We used to say
I am an Australian, and that was the
flag we used to salute,” pointing to a
Union Jack on the doll’s house alongside
which she was standing.
Never so much in its history has Aus-
tralia needed dynamic leadership as it
does now; we desperately need to be
made aware, again and again, of the
international and internal realities, of
the moral and cultural issues that affect

not only our progress but our survival.
As Donald Horne observes in his chapter
on “Republican Australia”, under our
present system we could never have a
John Kennedy in Australia. Our youth is
offered a distant Queen, a glimpse of a
Prince (if they can afford it), and two
ancient political bosses. No wonder the
monarchy bores them. Richard Walsh,
one of the editors of OZ, wrote to me
in a letter accompanying his chapter on
“The Monarchy as a Valid Social Sym-
bol”. “When you get down to your
writing table you suddenly realise that
the greatest indictment against monarchy
is that it is so uninspiring to the writer.”
OZ has tried to stir up controversy about
the monarchy by deliberately tasteless
cartoons and skits, though these are mild
compared with those published in
satirical magazines in England, but the
monarchy has so little relevance as a
social symbol for Australian youth that
no one cares. About the only wider stir-
ring-up that happens is a little satire on
the Mavis Bramston Show.
What of the future? If either political
party were crazy enough to offer the
Australian people a referendum on the
question of a republican Australia
(which of course they would not), there
is no doubt that at the moment a majority
would vote to retain the monarchy. Yet
the monarchy offers nothing to our
collective intelligence, to our scientists,
teachers, technicians; nothing to our cul-
ture, to our writers, designers, architects,
musicians, painters; nothing to our
workers, to use a word as old-fashioned
as Queen; nothing to our precarious but
quite definite Australianness. The affec-
tion and loyalty it does draw from good
people would be better given to their own
country. This, of course, is only my
opinion, although 1 find I share it with an
astonishing variety of people. All those
who think that, with all its faults, this is
still the best country in the world in
which to live, cannot much longer post-
pone some sort of enquiry into the
paradox that its official ruler is not an
Australian. At last we have an Austra-
lian Governor-General, who with his
wife represents many of the best qualities
of Australians (would that we had had
him there, as we could have had twelve
years ago). Would it not be fine if he
were our own President, and not the
representative of a distant Queen?

Is this
any way
to treat
a fine
car?
Why not? Today’s fine cars are as tough as yesterday’s trucks.
There are many reasons for this increased durability. Improved
engineering. Better materials. More efficient engines.
And better bearings. Today, millions of cars roll on tapered roller
bearings. Hundreds of makes and models and millions of cars are
giving better service because they are equipped with Timken tapered
roller bearings. The Timken Company pioneered the tapered design
over 66 years ago, and we’ve concentrated on it ever since. We’re the
world’s largest producer of tapered roller bearings.
The steel in every Timken bearing is high in nickel content and case-
hardened to give it longer life under shock loads. The result is better
performance, more compact design in wheels, pinion and differential.
This is an important reason why you can get more enjoyment and
more work-out of your car. Australian Timken Pty. Ltd., Box 240,

AROUND MELBOURNE
How Afferheck Lauder’s life was changed
Morn jessa flesh in the pen
Melbourne always was a good
Strine Town. Sales of “Let Stalk
Strine” by Professor Afferbeck Lauder
are now closing in on 50,000, but
we’re proud to say that the best sales
have been in Victoria. There is even
a Strine Sussierty which has regular
meetings at the City and Overseas
Club in Queens Road, Melbourne. On
Strine nights it is the duty of members
to formally present papers. One night
we had a paper on some of our
beloved football terms. Outstanding
examples: Throne Nepal. Errol Apace
Mugs. Git Orpheus Back. Ease Honor
Zone. Guest Tack Interim. Pea Nasser
Lollies Hop Eyes. Sod Drinks. We had
a beautiful reading of Banjo Pater-
son’s epic poem “Clancy Theo Flo”
plus a very nice paper on Melbun
Ryew’ye strine all around the stations:
Poor Melbun, Will Astound, Sinnel,
Core Feel, Ben Lee, Mill Park, Skilda,
Mill Brine and, of course, Brine Bitch.
So after all this you can imagine the
excitement of meeting the Professor
himself in a small office in North
Sydney. He was about to go over the
top and reveal his identity. He was
nervous, apprehensive. Strine already
had utterly changed his life and he
feared ii would change it further. It’s
incredible how nobody ever turns out
as expected. The Professor is, of
course, Alistair Morrison, a kindly,
amiable man with grey hair in a crew
cut, and a love for nicely cut, slightly
mod, black suits. A professor, cer-
tainly not. He went to school at Scotch
College in Melbourne and left when
he was 14. “I wa’s no student,” said
he. He studied for a while at the
National Gallery Art School, then at
21 he left for Sydney. Self-taught, he
went into the design business; now
he is a successful design consultant,
and he has been President of the In-
dustrial Design Institute and the Con-
temporary Art Society. It’s true, he
did come from a Gloria Soame in
South Yarra. His father was a dentist
and his father’s Cousin was George
Ernest “Chinese” Morrison.
Ure Smith, the publishers, guarded
his secret well. If any newspaper
wanted to interview the professor,
first the call had to be made to Ure
Smith. Then Ure Smith called the
professor and he rang the newspaper.
One time he d d an ABC interview
and appeared at the studio as Affer-
beck Lauder. “Bob Sanders,” he said,
“tried very hard to get me to reveal
my real name, but I wouldn’t tell him.
Only one person recognised my voice
from that broadcast, Hal Missingham.
He called me up and said: ‘Come ’orf
it mate, what are you up to?’
“Most people thought I was a pro-
fessor or a lecturer at the University,
Professor Hunter, Professor Mitchell,
or somebody. That was a great help.
If I really had been at the University
it would have been hard to hide, but
being here on my own it was easy.
One day I felt 1 just had to tell some-
body. So I said to a friend ‘As a
matter of fact I am Afferbeck Lauder’.
He laughed and didn’t believe me. In
Strine talk the friend thought he was
a Rep Bairg, in short, one who would
Never Glue’.”
Morrison said it was true Strine
sprang entirely from the incident with
Monica Dickens at the book shop. He
was in a holiday hut up on the Snowy.
His wife had gone back to Melbourne.
He read in a newspaper how a woman
handed this book to Monica Dickens
and said “Emma Chisit”, whereupon
Miss Dickens wrote “To Emma
Chisit” above her name on the flyleaf.
He thought about this. “How much is
IT?” Wouldn’t it be fun if there really
were a different language in Australia?
He became tremendously excited, and
the more he thought, the*more Strine
came to mind. So he penned off a
piece to “The Sydney Morning
Herald”, which used it, wrote back to
him in Strine and so it all began.
“It was all just incredible,” he said.
“I couldn’t cope. I couldn’t do my
job. I lay awake at night with a note-
book jotting down Strine for the next
week. The letters just came in piles
and piles, thousands of them. What
startled me most was-this. I’ve worked
all my life at a job, tried to be good
at it, and make a bit of a name for
myself, with a modest result. Then,
suddenly, all because of a gimmick
I’m famous all over the country under
an assumed name. Sometimes I feel
like a con man.”
Where does he go from here?
There’s a line in “Let Stalk Strine”
which says “Flesh in the pen: Momen-
tary Brilliance. As in: ’Ar, Stoo Gooder
Last, Sairndra, It’s jessa flesh in the
pen.” Morrison is conscious of this.
But “Let Stalk Strine” is being pub-
lished in London and it is very in just
now with “The Observer”-“Sunday
Times” set.
He is hoping to bring out another
Strine book with maybe verse and
fiction in it, but Mr Morrison, who
has already proved himself very good
at keeping secrets, won’t say more
than that.
This week he is being feted in Mel-
bourne at Book Week, appearing on
TV and all the right programmes.
Underneath it all he is very proud of
“Let Stalk Strine”. He said: “I did the
sketches, the layout and the Strine,
so I look at it and say, ‘lt’s only a
little book but, hell, it's all mine’.”

Is the Writing on the
“Wallpaper”?
The way ahead for consumer magazines
By ROBIN BRAMPTON
Proclaiming itself “A new kind of
magazine for a new kind of
woman”, a monthly magazine
called “Nova” was launched in Britain
this year. Among its first contributors
was a father who pondered the prob-
lem of how to ask his daughter’s boy-
friend if his intentions were honorable
when he knew the couple were sleeping
together, anyway. More recently “Nova”
has illustrated a feature on a new men-
tal preparation for childbirth technique
with explicit pictures showing stage-by-
stage the emergence of a baby from the
womb and the mother’s facial reaction.
Just as new is “Nova’s” design format,
the product of imaginative young artists
and which owes nothing to the inflexible
magazine traditions.
“Nova” is one of several new or dras-
tically revamped magazines emerging
overseas in a hurricane of change which
has started to blow through the con-
sumer magazine industry. But hardly a
zephyr of this has yet reached Australian
magazine readers whose shillings have
made this nation, on a population pro-
portion basis, probably the strongest
market in the world.
Australian publishers, perhaps, have
reason to pause before making a radical
change. The techniques which brought
the industry to such strength after the
war enabled it to survive the first impact
of television even stronger in terms of
both circulation and advertising revenue.
! Indeed, the only new high-circulation
'magazine to be produced with anything
approximating a new formula did not
survive. This was “Home and Family”,
a women’s service magazine launched
last year for sale only in food stores. It
ran for 14 issues, and reached circulation
of 125,000
The demise of “Home and Family”
still leaves Australia with a round dozen
weekly, fortnightly and monthly maga-
zines selling more than 100,000 copies
per issue, two or three more than 10
pars ago. On the surface, several appear
P be flourishing. For sbme issues be-
peen now and Christmas, top weeklies
Pike the giant “The Australian Women’s
weekly", as well as “Woman’s Day” and
‘Everybody’s” will be carrying their
biggest advertising revenues ever.
Eut in the midst of plenty there are
P ne or two ominous signs. Current cir-
pulations of at least seven of the top 12
publications are below their peak. Only
four can claim that their latest Audit
Bureau of Circulations figures (for the
six months ending in March) are higher
than ever before. They are “The Austra-
lian Women’s Weekly” (840,000),
“Reader’s Digest” (530,962), “New
Idea” (265,301) and “Everybody’s”
(234,000).
Added to this, the magazine industry
will have to face an entirely new type of
competition in the next decade when it
loses its monopoly of the only advan-
tage it now has over other media
color.
For several years major daily papers
have been able to run full-color adver-
tising, using the “wallpaper” method of
combining pre-printed color rotogravure
with the newsprint reels going through
the black-and-white presses. The color
artwork is continuous and it does not
matter at which point it is cut off in the
production of each single newspaper.
Now, going a stage farther, newspapers
are installing equipment to synchronise
fully pre-printed rotogravure pages with
the newspaper page, thus enabling news-
papers to sell color advertising in level
competition with magazines.
Next, color will come to television,
and it is obvious that paint, cosmetic
and fashion advertisers will channel a
much greater part of their advertising
appropriations into TV when color
arrives.
Having survived black-and-white tele-
vision, the consumer magazine will sur-
vive these threats, too. But how and to
what degree? Before answering that, let’s
look at the “Top 12” and how they are
faring:
“The Australian Women’s Weekly”
(840,000): The consort battleship of Aus-
tralian magazines, with the distinction of
achieving a higher penetration (circula-

mV........ ... .... ... . .7.” EMS7A id
tion related to size of market) than any
other women’s magazine in the world.
Its design and typography seem to have
altered little in recent years, but the
editorial emphasis has changed quite
significantly of late in favor of service
features. Regular liftouts on domestic
subjects have replaced “Teenagers’
Weekly” in the centre of the magazine.
It has now almost completely ditched
Royalty as an aid to sales.
“Woman’s Day” (505,000): Often
behind “The Australian Women’s
Weekly” in the quality of its color re-
production, “Woman’s Day” has a
feature policy which rides the news hard.
In the last two years its circulation has
been almost at a standstill, but its ad-
vertising revenue has shown a marked
increase.
“Reader’s Digest” (530,962): Highest
sale in the monthly field. In the last three
years the circulation has increased
80,000. The “Digest’s” carefully planned
formula and devastatingly thorough
marketing methods have proved highly
successful in the Australian market.
More than 400,000 of its circulation is
on postal subscription.
“Australasian Post” (316,963): Cir-
culation has fallen from a.' peak of
334,093, but has now levelled out at
the present figure. Melbourne-based
“Post” is Australia’s top-selling general
magazine, and appears to sell consistently
in all age groups. Keeps to a “tight” for-
mula which has changed little in recent
years.
“TV Week” (309,446) and “TV Times”
(253,000): Both have recently suffered
slight declines in circulation, although
their market has increased with the
opening up of television in new areas.
They are highly competitive and enter-
prising, and frequently scoop the daily
papers with TV stories despite their
longer deadlines.
“New Idea” (265,301): Most dynamic
circulation success of any of the “Top
12” in the past two years. Some recent
issues have sold over 300,000. “New
Idea” has made great headway despite
having none of the glossy full-color
facilities of “The Australian Women’s
Weekly” and “Woman’s Day”.
“Everybody’s” (234,000): Born of an
uneasy “marriage of convenience” be-
tween the “Australian Woman’s Mirror”
and “Weekend” in 1961, “Everybody’s”
has gained ground in the last 2 i years
since it switched its appeal very largely
towards the under-21 market. It is the
only magazine to capitalise heavily on
the “pop” music boom. It adopts a more
up-tempo layout and typographical policy
than other Australian magazines, with
results that are sometimes very effective
and at others disappointing.
“Pix” (186,357): The “old stager” of
the general magazines, it has staunchly
held to approximately its present circula-
tion for several years. When it lost its
appeal as a picture magazine to the more
immediate impact of television, it
shrewdly switched to a semi-service
policy with well-produced supplements
on family interests like boating, motoring,
do-it-yourself and how to avoid income
tax.
“Australian Home Journal” (circula-
tion now undisclosed; its last ABC figure
was 220,000). Apart from The Bul-
letin, the “Journal” is Australia’s oldest
national magazine. In the last 20 months
the “Journal” has changed hands, in-
creased in price from Is. 6d. to 2s. and
been considerably revamped into a more
colorful and professional production. The
effect on circulation has not been dis-
closed, but already advertising has con-
siderably increased
“People” (131,096): In 1962, the
magazine was selling almost 200,000,
and in the last three years it has ex-
perienced a depressing circulation slide
which obviously must be halted if it is
to survive.
How many of these dozen will survive
the next decade? At the bottom of the
premiership, there are bound to be some
casualties. And among the leaders dras-
tic new thinking will be needed to main-
tain circulations.
Magazines in Australia have achieved
most of their success in the last 30 years
through the heavy use of pictorial tech-
niques. But when the impact of all these
even color—is lost to television and
newspapers, then there will have to be a
swinging back to the good old-fashioned
virtues of editorial writing and the newly
discovered virtues of design.
Another path to survival is for maga-
zines to take up the path indicated by
the recent successes of the more selec-
tively directed “Everybody’s” and “New
Idea”. Consumer magazines must inten-
sively develop certain specific areas of
readership, instead of casting their nets
widely and indiscriminately as did the
“general” and “family” magazines of the
past.
But to carry this off, the magazines
will have to know far more about their
readerships than they do at present. With
advertising agencies putting ever greater
emphasis on media research, publishers
are going to be forced ever more into
the field of research and statistics them-
selves to sell their services to advertisers.
For the women’s magazines, the
emphasis on service will become even
stronger. Whatever else TV can do, it
cannot tell you how to knit a sweater
or make crepes suzette.
And at the same time let’s hope some
of them will stop wearing their skirts so
long and let a few strong gusts of con-
troversy and moral honesty blow across
their genteel brows.


THE INTELLIGENT
WOMAN'S GUIDE
A New Small
Head
What I needed was a new, small
head. All the fashion magazines
had told me so, and even if a
great many of their models had kept
their old, large ones, I knew that I was
beginning to look like the lion in “The
Wizard of Oz”.
I asked my smartest friend where she
had her hair cut and made an appoint-
ment. I was so eager that I arrived a
breathless ten minutes early. I sat in a
small space just inside the double glass
doors and beside the constantly ringing
telephone. From time to time young men
dashed out to answer the telephone, as
they talked fixing my head with a
basilisk stare. I was glad I had not left
it even longer.
When it was my turn, I went into the
main salon pink-lit caramel and white.
It made me look green. A small caramel-
colored boy took me to a cubicle at the
far end of the room. Eight immobilised
but still glamorous-looking ladies watched
my progress. I made my Grace Darling
face.
“Does Madam wish to remove her
dress?”
I had no idea really, but on quick
consideration thought I had better not.
He wrapped madam in a caramel-colored
shroud and led her to a seat near the
gleaming steel wash-basins.
“I want my hair cut,” I said firmly.
“Mr George always trims wet.”
I sat down. A paler version of Cilia
Black moved in behind me and began
to adjust my head. My neck appeared, as
usual, to be too short. She got it into a
useful position which involved a kind of
1 reverse garrotting action across my
spine. I sat tight.
This was really quite pleasant. My
fears were all groundless. Only the oc-
casional contact of her long nails with my
scalp and -the detergent suds in my ears
I intruded on my quiet dreams.
Then it was over. She went away.
What should I do ’now? I fretted about
this for five minutes, until the boy re-
turned and led me to a chair among the
beautiful ladies.
On my right, a lady of uncertain but
mature age was having a pearl pink
hillock arranged on her brow. Her
beautifully manicured pearl-pink fingers
stretched upwards from the arm of her
chair. A small black poodle snorted dis-
gustingly in her lap. From time to time
one of the more energetic young men
leapt from his side of the room barking
gaily. The dog and the lady responded.
Oh my left, another mature lady was
disconsolately pouting her beautiful
mouth and asking Francois if he really
thought it was her. It was her all right.
From the knee-length socks to the tight,
ribbed sweater.
Mr George ran up. What did I want
done with my hair? I laughed politely
and said, “Cut”. He picked up hanks of
it disbelievingly and sighed. “It’s been
very badly done.”
I had been very fond of my last hair-
dresser, and if he hadn’t gone to Les
Girls at Kings Cross would have been
with him still. I told Mr George this. He
fixed me with a hard eye and began to
tell me about his two daughters, and
hacked off more hair than I thought I
actually had.
My head got smaller and smaller. We
had stopped talking to one another. I
hadn’t the courage to give voice to my
silent scream. And then he had finished.
“Set?” he asked, as if it were a rhetori-
cal question. “I don’t think so,” the
shrunken head said into the
mirror. He looked aghast. “Well, it won't
look anything unless it's set!”
I bit back the obvious reply, and,
standing in my sensible shoes and too
long skirt, among heaps of hair, lied
that I had an appointment and told my-
self that I had spent over an hour on my
hair already.
He swept away. I found my coat my-
self. Awkwardly pushed too large a tip
into Cilia Black's caramel nylon pocket.
Ignored the smooth-skinned boy. And
ran the gauntlet of 16 mascaraed eyes.
It cost me thirty bob. Still, I was better
off than the girl who ended up tearfully
with a very ordinary shampoo and set
instead of a glamorous new cut, because
once she got into the system no one
would listen to her protests about what
she had really come for.
My hair won’t need cutting for quite a
while now, anyway. And perhaps by then
the magazines will let me look like Lennie
the Lion.
Mrs Hodgkin’s
Nobel Prize
I was throwing out papers when I came
across a Christmas edition of a very
respectable newspaper supplement. In
among the hints for fancy wrapping, the
decorations and '“what the waiter thinks
of you”, was an article on Britain’s 58th
Nobel Prize winner, Professor Dorothy
Hodgkin.
Professor Hodgkin is professor of
crystallography at Oxford and won the
prize for her X-ray analyses of the
structures of crystals like those of vitamin
812. But it’s hard to work that out from
the article. It is preoccupied with her
three children (she is now 54), her com-
muting to see her husband in Ghana, and
her husband’s family’s intellectual con-
nections of which it draws an impres-
sively photographed tree.
It buries the fact that she is a Fellow
of the Royal Society in with details about
the carelessness of her fair hair, her blue
eyes and her efficient domestic arrange-
ments.
It examines her mother and father’s
life in the Sudan, mentions the lab. she
built as a teenager, with “bits and pieces
of glassware I bought for myself”, says
that her school “wasn’t one of those from
which it was easy for a girl to get to
Oxford”. (Was it ever easy?)
Tells how she met her husband (at a
friend’s house) and how they didn’t set
up a home together for eight years. Men-
tions their six or seven years together at
Oxford, after which he went off to Africa.
Discusses his activities in Africa in quite
a bit of detail.
Quotes her attitude to toilet training
and tells how she spends one term in
three in Ghana. “This commuting, which
would be intolerable to many other wives,
is yet another unproblem for her.” In
Accra she plays a part, “of a somewhat
casual kind”, in the Chemistry Depart-
ment. She gives them “a bit of advice
and general stimulation”.
Almost every other paragraph tries to
fit her into “the family tradition”, though,
apart from her father, all the intellectual-
ism seems to belong to her husband’s
family and she hasn’t seen much of
him.
Professor Dorothy Hodgkin, who was
“just brought up” to intellectual distinc-
tion, emerges very uncertainly from all
this, but “that affable-looking housewife”,
married to the Director of the Institute
of African Studies at the University of
Ghana, comes out loud and clear.
As Marlene Dietrich recently re-
marked, “Isn’t anybody going to ask me
about my profession?”

Most of Rhodesia’s 217,000 whites stand solidly behind lan Smith and his men,
whom the Queen has dismissed from office. But an influential minority do not. They
are in three groups.
First are those who support Sir Roy
Welensky, leader of the defunct Central
African Federation (of Northern and
Southern Rhodesia and Nyasaland), who
was personally humiliated by Smith’s
Deputy Prime Minister, Clifford Dupont,
when he sought to enter Rhodesian
politics at a by-election in Salisbury in
August last year. Welensky was against
a unilateral declaration of independence.
But, now that this has happened, he has
advised support for “the forces of law
and order”, even though they are rep-
resented by “revolutionary government”.
Nonetheless, he and his followers are
likely to wait in the wings ready to
emerge if and when UDI begins to
crumble and Smith’s followers turn
against him. Many of them had deserted
Weler.sky for Smith
and might desert
Smith for Welensky
1 once things go
wrong. But they
have no black sup-
port.
Secondly, there
are the old support-
| ers of Sir Edgar
Whitehead, ex-
Premier of Southern
Rhodesia, led by
David Butler now
that their leader Sir
1 Edgar has emi-
grated to Britain. They are likely to
ido what they can to support the Gov-
ernor and resist UDI.
They may be as few 7 in number as
20,000 but they include many influential
sections of the local Establishment the
'Press, the bankers, the industrialists, the
'judges and the professional classes. They
think of majority rule in terms of 15 not
50 years, and might play the same role
as Sir Michael Blundell and his sup-
porters played in Kenya in the transition
from minority to majority rule.
: Among them are political conserva-
tives like Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle,
and his more radical predecessor Sir
Robert Tredgold, as well as the leaders
pf the Rhodesian Council of Churches,
including Roman Catholics, Anglicans
and non-conformists, led by the blunt-
speaking 47-year-old Bishop of Mata-
heleland, Dr Kenneth Skelton. Their
Wack support lies with Josiah Gondo and
his fellow-MPs.
IAN SMITH
Thirdly there are the white radicals
who include independent churchmen,
University teachers and professional men
like Dr Ahrn Palley, MP, Liberals like
the Rhodesian-born, fighter-pilot hero
Hardwick Holderness, and supporters of
ex-Premier Garfield Todd who are as-
sociated with Nationalist Joshua Nkomo’s
ZAPU Party, such as Eileen Haddon,
the editor of the Central African
“Examiner”, Guy Clutton-Brock and
Nkomo’s lawyer, Leo Baron.
The black Africans fall into four
categories:
1. The Chiefs, on whom Smith relies.
He intends to introduce them into his
Parliament, but their writ runs only as
far as white authority can make it run.
2. The middle group of Africans who
refused to join the
African Nationalist
movement in boy-
cotting the 1961
Constitution but in-
stead joined White-
head's party and now
represent the official
Opposition 14
MPs-strong in
Parliament, led by
Josiah Gondo.
African Nationalists
see them as
“stooges”. But as
the white leadership
moved Rightwards, so this group has
come closer to the Nationalists.
3. The Nationalists who are sharply
divided in two: the larger group, ZAPU
(Zimbabwe African People’s Union), led
by Joshua Nkomo. He and thousands of
his followers are in prison, restriction or
exile; and the minority movement.
ZANU (Zimbabwe African National
Union), led by the Rev. Ndatamingi Sit-
hole, which has attracted a considerable
section of the country’s black intel-
lectuals. Its leaders, too, are in prison,
restriction or exile.
Whether these two wings can unite in
the hour of their common danger depends
largely on a fourth group: the exiles.
Some of these are undergoing military
training in African and Communist
countries. Some are students like the
journalist Nathan Shamuyariro .who is
in America, and Henry Hamadziripi who
is at Ruskin College, Oxford. Others are
working for African governments or

But the top-ranking Rhodesian Nation-
alist politicians abroad include Robert
Chikerema, George Nyandoro and
Silundika. There has been talk of the
formation of two Rhodesian govern-
ments being formed as rivals to Smith by
the rival Nationalist movements. But a
successful provisional government would
depend on an official recognision by the
Organisation for African Unity, and that,
in turn, depends on unity between ZAPU
and ZANU.
The men behind Smith are as follows:
Clifford Dupont: Smith’s deputy,
Foreign and Defence Minister, a likely
choice for regent if one becomes needed.
Aged 60, a Cambridge-educated London
solicitor and company director. Went to
Rhodesia to farm in 1948 after service
as a major in the Royal Artillery in
England and North Africa. He is quiet,
intelligent, sophisticated, and suffers
from ill-health. He was Minister of
Justice in Winston Field’s 1962 Govern-
ment and, as such, clapped Nkomo and
Sithole in restriction soon after Smith
succeeded Field in April, 1964. Resigned
seat to fight—and defeat —Welensky in
Salisbury by-election, August, 1964, by
1079 votes to 633.
William Harper: Smith’s most extreme
lieutenant and probable successor if he
had shied away from UDI. Minister of
Internal Affairs. Aged 50, born in Cal-
cutta, son of an Assam tea-planter. Battle
of Britain pilot, he moved to Rhodesia
after India’s independence in 1949 and
set up as a farmer and earth-moving con-
tractor. MP since 1958. He used to lead
Southern Rhodesian section of the
opposition Dominion Party, whose
Federal leader was Winston Field. Did
not hide his attraction towards apartheid.
Now keeps the Chiefs —and Smith—in
line.
Desmond Lardner - Burke: South
African-born Minister of Law and Order.
Small - town lawyer, he has lived in
Rhodesia since 1933 but entered Parlia-
ment only in 1962. Became known when
he petitioned, as back-bencher, for the
Queen to amend the constitution so as
to renounce reserved powers to the
Southern Rhodesian Government. His
motion passed but the Government never
acted on it. Entered the Cabinet earlier
this year. “Can restrict people without
trial for up to 15 years. When courts
over-rule his orders, he varies them.
Limited horizons: striking lack of humor.
John Wrathall: Smith’s Finance Mini-
ster. He visited London in September
with Harper and stayed to accompany
Smith at talks with British Government.
Ager 52, born and Grammar school-
educated in Lancaster, he trained as an
accountant in London and went out to
Rhodesia 30 years ago to work in
Income Tax Department.
Lord Graham: Fifty-eight-year-old 7th
Duke of Montrose but prefers to use his
courtesy title or be just Angus Graham.
Boxed for Eton and Oxford and went to
Rhodesia in 1931 as an agronomist after
being in the agricultural branch of
Imperial Chemical Industries. Destroyer
commander in war; farming and politics
afterwards. First elected to Southern
Rhodesian Parliament in 1958 as mem-
ber of Field/Harper Dominion Party,
having previously fought first - Federal
election in 1953 for Confederate Party,
its Right-wing branch. Has spoken in
House of Lords, supporting and being
supported by Lord Salisbury. Personally
popular but no great shakes. Has pre-
tensions to phrenology.
Douglas (Boss) Lilford: Smith’s mil-
lionaire friend. Helped him found
Rhodesia Front in 1961 when Smith
resigned as Welensky’s Chief Whip and
wanted to weld all Opposition groups to-
gether. Now one of its vice-presidents
and financial backers. Fifty-seven years
old, born in South Africa but came north
when baby. Owns 33,000 acres, devoted
to typical Rhodesian pattern of tobacco,
grass and beef.
The Rhodesians in between are as
follows:
Sir Hugh Beadle: Sixty-year-dld, big-
game-hunting Chief Justice. Rhodesian
born, legally trained in South Africa
and Oxford (Rhodes Scholar). Practised
in Bulawayo and served in Godfrey
Huggins’s Cabinet after the war as
Minister of Justice and, later, Health.
Went on the Bench in 1950 and became
Chief Justice in 1961 when Sir Robert
Tredgold resigned. He allowed Nkomo’s
appeal against earlier detention order.
Has several times criticised the Govern-
ment from the Bench.
David Butler: Thirty-seven-year-old
Olympic yachtsman, London-born, Eton-

Rhodesia in 1949 first as tobacco farmer
and, later, as aeronautical engineer. Burst
into prominence when he led delegation
of five to UN to put “moderate” case.
Three of his team were Africans, one
being Josiah Gondo who last May
succeeded him as leader of opposition
party to Smith’s Government.
Sir Robert Tredgold: Beadle’s pre-
decessor as Chief Justice. Third genera-
tion Rhodesian, his father was Attorney-
General and senior judge and both his
grandfather and great-grandfather on
mother’s side were missionary members
of the famous Moffat family, through
whom he is related to David Livingstone.
Went on Bench in 1943 and became
Chief Justice in 1950. Resigned in 1960
in protest against Law and Order (Main-
tenance) Bill which, he said, outraged
almost every basic human right. Liberal
but constitutionalist he said last year
UDI would be treason.
Dr Ahrn PaHey: The only white
Opposition MP elected by Africans on
B roll. Bald, paunchy doctor-turned-
lawyer, he came up from South Africa
with a hotel company. He had been a
member of the South African Labor
Party but entered Parliament in 1958,
three years after arriving in Rhodesia,
and sat on the front bench of the Right-
wing Dominion Party. Within a year
he had left the caucus over his total
opposition to Whitehead’s security
legislation. He never opposed African
advancement though never disguised his
view of their unreadiness and refusal to
work the 1961 constitution. Once held
the floor for 17 hours and on another
occasion divided the House 165 times
in one evening.
Josiah Gondo: Fifty-year-old butcher
who (much to his surprise) found himself
last April the first African leader of the
Opposition. All his white colleagues,
including David Butler, the previous
leader, had been defeated. Has been
teacher, bricklayer, and singer and
holds Diploma in Commerce. Avowed
middle-of-the-roader, he was one of
Butler’s delegation to the UN in 1962,
the year he entered Parliament. Has
had his shop wrecked by Nkomo sup-
porters because he did not go along
with them. The same year, when helping
Whitehead's “Build a Nation” campaign,
he was turned away from a white hotel.
Opposes Land Apportionment Act.
Wants Africans to work 1961 constitu-
tion and has moved perceptibly to the
Nationalists as Smith has gone Right.
Sir Roy Weiensky: Ex-Federal Prime
Minister, now retired: but he is still
only 58, and by no means a spent force.
Born in Salisbury, the youngest of 12
children of an Afrikaner mother and a
Polish-Jewish father. Worked as railway-
man and politician in Northern Rhodesia
(now Zambia) until 1953, when he be-
came Huggins’s Deputy Prime Minister
at the birth of Federation he had cam-
paigned for. Succeeded as Prime Minister
in 1956. Following Federation’s break-
up, entry to Southern Rhodesian politics
proved abortive when he was soundly
beaten in a by-election.
Garfield Todd: Missionary - turned-
Prime Minister - turned - rancher, whom
Smith clapped under restriction last
month. Born in New Zealand and
educated there and in South Africa, he
did 12 years’ mission work in Rhodesia
before entering politics in 1946. Leap-
frogged into Premiership when Huggins
became Federal Prime Minister. Was
tough when he had to be, but introduced
reforms in education, trade unions and
the franchise. Replaced by Whitehead
when he acted without consulting col-

Then led his own Central Africa Party,
but resigned in 1960 after signing appeal
with Nkomo to the British Government
to suspend constitution. Since then has
been associated with Nkomo’s ZAPU.
Leo Baron: Dr Bronowski’s brother,
Nkomo’s lawyer, he was first white man
to be restricted in Rhodesia and has
already been detained since UDI. Once
played table tennis for Britain and used
to partner lain Macleod at bridge: he
perfected the “Baron” system. Former
member of Garfield Todd’s Central
African Party, he became “Spectator’s”
Rhodesian correspondent under Macleod
but later fell out with him over Macleod’s
change of front over Rhodesia.
Joshua Nkomo: Wilson found him
better than he expected. After chequered
career, now undeniably leads majority
body of African Nationalists from his
detention camp. Forty-nine years old, he
received secondary education in South
Africa and later got his degree by post.
On his return in 1947 took a trade
union post and became known so
quickly that Fluggins took him to London
for talks on Federation in 1952. Dis-
illusioned he about-turned and fought
Federation. By 1954, however, he had
joined Huggins’s party and fought an
election. After three years in business
he was called to head the reborn
Nationalist movement but when White-
head arrested its leaders he was abroad.
After 18 months in exile he returned to
take up presidency, participated in
negotiations for the 1961 Constitution
but could not agree on proposals and
walked out. In 1963 there was a break-
away from his leadership and the party’s
national chairman, Sithole, led a new
movement. Since then Nkomo has spent
much time in prison and detention.
The Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole: Forty-
five - year - old Methodist minister,
educated at Garfield Todd’s mission and
later at universities in South Africa and
the United States. First joined Todd’s
party but soon switched to the African
Nationalists, from whom he split away
in 1963, taking with him some of
Nkomo’s senior lieutenants and much
of his intellectual support. Author of an
important book on African nationalism.
A chubby, sincere Christian and moderate
who has become increasingly radical.
Robert Chikerema: Helps Nyandoro
organise ZAPU abroad from base in
Zambia. Roman Catholic education
eight year* of it in South Africa, he has
been full-time politico since he and
Nyandoro set up together in 1956 and
later induced Nkomo to enter politics.
They have stood by him ever since. Tall,
lithe, angry, he can be obstinate and
aggressive, but personally attractive

DUNLOP REPORT TO INDUSTRY
PAVING THE WAY
FOR THE
NEW JET AGE
Dunlop conveyor belts help carry 2\ million
tons of foundations at Tullamarine

■•: •..
Just 14 miles from the centre of the
spreading metropolis of Melbourne,
situated on 5,500 acres of semi-rural
reserve, construction is well under way
on Australia’s latest jet-age project—
the Tullamarine International Airport.
Scheduled to be in operation by mid-
-1967, this jet-port will bring direct
overseas jet services to Melbourne.
Construction of the basic airfield facili-
ties at Tullamarine, including its two
main runways, taxiways, aircraft parking
aprons and a drainage system is being
performed by a joint venture of Mor-
rison-Knudsen of Australia Ltd. and
McDonald Industries Pty. Ltd.
In the interest of speed and economy
the engineering contractors decided to
install their own crushing plant on the
site to produce the material for the
runway foundations.
This is where Dunlop is playing an
important role.
Conveyor belts have been installed to
handle 2\ million tons of crushed rock
quarried along the Maribyrnong River
at the western end of the project. This
rock is required for the runway fills
which go as deep as 13 feet!
These conveyor belts —for the technic-
ally minded —are 36" x 5-ply with
x Ig" covers and 30" x 4-ply with
x -fa” covers. And they are doing a
mighty tough task, when you consider
the immense size of the project.

“NEOLON IS A WINNER"
SAYS ‘CAPTAIN CANVAS’
Runways 58" thick!
Built up from multiple
layers of carefully pro-
cessed base gravel and
paving materials, the two
main runways will be 58"
thick! These are the largest
runways in Australia,
measuring a mighty 7,900
ft. and 8,900 ft. in length,
including over-run.
It is from the primary
crushing plant that a com-
plex of Dunlop conveyor
belts carry the rock from
the screen and sizing plant
into trucks, onto stock-
pile or the job. This is
just another instance of the
many ways in which ver-
satile Dunlop conveyor
belting is aiding industry
and construction work, in'
all its facets.

In just ten years, enthusiastic young
Sydney designer and businessman Jim
Dixon has made the name “Captain
Canvas” synonymous with first-class
fabricated goods in canvas—and (we’re
happy to add) in Dunlop Neolon.
“We’ve already had enormous success
with Neolon in construction work, in
agriculture, and in the maritime and
transport industries; yet we’ve barely
started to assess its full possibilities”,
comments Jim Dixon. “The Hypalon-
coated Nylon fabric lasts twice as long
as other tarpaulin materials, yet is in-
credibly light. It is flexible when wet;
dries almost instantly; doesn’t shrink;
and resists solvents, oil and chemicals.
With this combination of features, it’s
hardly surprising that Neolon fills the
bill for almost any covering job. I’d
say the potential for Neolon—at home
and on the export market—is virtually
unlimited.”

Sanctions
A South African colony?
By R. B. SUTCLIFFE
The overwhelmingly important ques-
tion about Rhodesia may well be the!
territory’s vulnerability to economic
sanctions applied in response to an act [
of rebellion.
A total ban on imports into Rhodesia!
is out of the question. The Rhodesians)
can continue to obtain all the imports-,
they need, including oil, through South,
Africa for all Dr Verwoerd’s mis-r
givings about a Rhodesian seizure ofj
independence or the Portuguese terri-
tories.
Trade sanctions, therefore, must rely
on being able to hit exports. A quarter!
of these (mostly tobacco and other raw)
materials) have gone to Britain, another,
quarter to Zambia (mostly manufactured!
goods). No other country has taken morel
than about 6 p.c. of exports. Regardless'
of what other countries did, therefore,
the main task of an export boycott falls!
to Britain and Zambia.
There are some measures which the
rebel Government could take to mitigate
the slump which this will tend to pro-
duce. It could try to re-stimulate the
economy by a programme of public
spending. This might alleviate the
unemployment problem, but, since the
exports Rhodesia will lose are not, by
and large, the things for which demand I
would be stimulated, this move would
probably do little more than produce
some unnecessary public works, a larger
imports bill and consequent balance-of-
payments problems.
Rhodesia could also search out new'
markets for her exports. Here the pros-!
pects are not promising. Only a few
nations South Africa, Portugal, Spain
and perhaps France can be counted
on to be sympathetic. None of them has
hitherto bought much from Rhodesia.
Either, like South Africa, they have their
own supplies of the raw materials which
she produces, or, like France, they are
committed to other suppliers. None of
the raw materials which Rhodesia exports
is in notably short supply in the world
and even if markets can be found they
will be comparatively depressed ones.
Rhodesian manufactures, excluded from
Zambia, would find it hard to compete
with the domestic manufacturing indus-
tries even of sympathetic countries in
the unlikely event that access was given
to their markets.
Rhodesia has a third weapon in her!
armory counter - sanctions againsti
Zambia. All rail access through Rhodesh
could be stopped. This would affect abou
90 per cent of Zambia’s copper export

and the great majority of Zambia’s
imports. The alternative routes could be
used more the Benguela railway
through the Congo and Angola for some
copper exports: this, and the route
through Tanzania and the Congo, cross-
ing Lake Tanganyika, for imports. There
is hardly enough surplus capacity on
these lines, however, to meet Zambia’s
needs completely. In any case, govern-
ments sympathetic to Zambia could run
down stockpiles and buy Zambian copper
for future delivery after sanctions ended.
Rhodesia’s other main counter-sanc-
tions could be to cut off the copperbelt
from supplies of coal and electricity.
Much of the loss of Kariba power
could be made good by imports of power
from Katanga. The loss of coal would
be more disastrous: but the copperbelt
has survived a loss of Rhodesian coal
once before when minimum needs were,
imported by the western route and sup-
plemented by local supplies of wood.
Finally, Rhodesia could deport all
Zambians working in Rhodesia: this
could do a small amount of damage to
the Zambian balance of payments as
well as increasing unemployment in
Zambia.
All these measures of counter-
sanctions would at the same time
rebound upon Rhodesia. The Wankie
coalfields and Rhodesia railways would
both suffer an enormous loss of business
and the costs of the Kariba power
station would be increased.
If, as some of the British business-
men who visited Rhodesia last month
think, economic relations between
Rhodesia and Zambia survive a UDI,
Zambia’s sufferings might be reduced to
mild inflation as sources of imports
were changed. But if the Rhodesians act
toughly, Britain could not fail to give a
good deal of help to Zambia an airlift
and financial aid at the least.
The British Government can also
apply financial sanctions to Rhodesia,
but these weapons look a little fragile.
A ban on Rhodesian borrowing in
London and withdrawal of the British
guarantee of world bank loans to
Rhodesia for the Kariba dam would
do little short-term damage, though it
would, of course, reduce the long-run
availability of foreign capital to Rhodesia.
A ban on the exchange of the
Rhodesian pound by British banks and
the freezing of Rhodesian assets in
London could considerably complicate
the finance of what remained of
Rhodesia’s trade after the boycott. But
Rhodesia still has gold in the coffers
(£3,500,000 worth) and more in the
ground. She might expect a generous
loan from South Africa. And British
financial houses with interests in both
Rhodesia and South Africa could, if
they wished to do so, transfer loans from
the latter to the former with the tacit
agreement of the Verwoerd government.
If, as the result of these palliatives,
the Rhodesian economy survived for any
length of time, then a slow recovery
might eventually set in, though the
country might find itself by this time
little more, economically, than a South
African colony. Another, probably
military, solution would eventually have
to be found.
Alternatively, the main economic
impact of sanctions might come
quite quickly. A British boycott of
exports will produce unemployment and
depression in the rural areas at first,
spreading quite quickly to the cities,
where a Zambian boycott will also have
its main impact. Europeans and Africans
alike will become unemployed.
While some Europeans will leave the
country and some Africans will return
to the rural areas, many will remain in
the cities without jobs. If the unemployed
Europeans clamor successfully to take
jobs still held by Africans, bitter re-
sentment will arise among the African
unemployed. It is unlikely that this situa-
tion will be controllable for long: an
outburst of racial violence of a par-
ticularly vicious kind will be almost
inevitable.
Either the regime will be forced into
ruthless measures to suppress African
unrest or there will be a situation of
mounting chaos. In either case, some
military presence either from Britain or
the United Nations could become
imperative.

LETTERS
The NZ Press
SIR. I greatly admire Mr Maurice
Shadbolt as a writer, of fiction, but his
excursions into realms of fact are less im-
pressive. I am not concerned with his
views on the News Media Bill, as ex-
pressed in the article “A Repugnant
Gag” (8., Nov. 6), but the article contains
at least three serious errors of fact.
First, Mr Shadbolt refers to “The New
Zealand Press Association which is ser-
viced solely by Reuters”. This associa-
tion draws news not only from Reuters
but from The Associated Press, United
Press International, Australian Associ-
ated Press, “The Times”, London, and
the “New York Times” News Service.
Through these primary sources we also
have access to news from many other
agencies including Tass, The Press Trust
of India. The New China News Agency
and Antara. Quotations from these
agencies appear frequently in New
Zealand dailies. Secondly, Mr Shadbolt
includes London in a list of places where
he says we have no full-time correspond
dent. In fact, we maintain two full-time
staff correspondents in London and have
done so for many years past. They
undertake regular assignments in Europe.
Thirdly. Mr Shadbolt says that “even in
neighboring Australia, coverage from a
New Zealand angle comes through
Reuter men for whom this country is a
part-time concern, as is the case in
London”.
The fact is that this association has
maintained staff representation in Aus-
tralia for many decades. Each week
many columns of Australian news appear
in New Zealand dailies, some of which
regularly use the name byline of the
NZPA staff correspondent. His work
complements the full service provided
by Australian Associated Press (not
Reuters). That we intend to maintain
the system is indicated by the fact that
we have just sent to Sydney a new full-
time correspondent to replace a man
who has completed his assignment and
is returning to Weilington. Most New
Zealand journalists, notwithstanding Mr
Shadbolt’s suggestion that mental leth-
argy is their distinguishing characteristic,
would have avoided his absurd errors by
the old-fashioned practice of checking
their facts before publication.

SIR. —lf we New Zealand journalists
were as Mr Shadbolt pictures us in his
unfair and inaccurate article, “A Repug.
nant Gag” (8., Nov. 6), then it must seem
passing strange to the percipient reader
that we, through our association, became
the focal point for, and leaders of, the
resistance to the stupidly illiberal New
Media Act.
Why should such a collection of cretins
be so concerned with such an abstraction
as the freedom of the Press, the enshrin-
ing of a native monopoly in such a vital
field? Yet, although from Mr Shadbolt’s
clumsy construction we appear to have
followed the “Waikato Times”, instead
of leading all, this he must and does
agree to. Surely then we are not quite
as he would have us, people with no
appreciation or knowledge? True, life
for most of us is in being a boxhand on
a big construction job, a driver of nails
and mover of scaffolding rather than the
composer of careful and cultivated
critical pieces. Yet such is surely the lot
of most journalists in most places. And
the crude disciplines which control us
curtail excursions into the sort of in-
accuracy which has Mr Shadbolt denying
the existence of NZ Press Association
men in London and Australia. He must,
or should know better. Certainly he did
when we worked together on the same
daily newspaper.

Naturally, the Builder . . . but it takes money to build homes.
Builders and home-owners alike know that Australia’s competing
banks are by far the largest institutional lenders for the building
of new homes. In addition to their significant contribution to
home-ownership, banks also financially back builders and build-
ers’ suppliers. And they will continue to help, within the limits
of their available funds. Whenever you see progress in Australia

lawyers, on behalf of society, fix the
amount of compensation to be paid to
road accident victims are, to quote Barry
Humphries, “like something out of
Kafka”.
Unfortunately the legal profession will
not be in the vanguard of any movement
for a rational scheme of compensation.
This reluctance on the part of the pro-
fession arises not so much from a fear
of a possible loss of earnings but rather
from the mental atrophy which sets in
when a person becomes an expert in a
complex and artificial system. It is ask-
ing a lot of a group of people constantly
using such a system to expect them to
stand outside it and say it is without
rational foundation and should therefore
be discarded. Articles from persons such
as Mr Robinson are sorely needed to
make legal practitioners ask themselves
“is this the best and fairest way?”
When I was a law student I spent a
year as an Associate to a Supreme Court
judge. Day by day I listened with grow-
ing amazement to six educated men
(judge, three counsel and two solicitors)
discuss with the intensity of mediaeval
scholastics whether the bunch of angels
were dancing an inch over the plaintiff’s
side of the yellow line or an inch on the
defendant’s side. Now that I am a mem-
ber of the profession, I find I can happily
enter into these abstract logical argu-
ments with as little regard to the realities
of driving a car on today’s roads as those
on whom I had poured such scorn in my
younger and less experienced days.
A word about the pleading system.
Recently I had a case (admittedly not
a running down one) which required an
excessive number of months, consider-
able fees to a barrister skilled in the
intricacies of pleading and 31 pages of
foolscap to inform the owner of a build-
ing on which alterations were being
carried out, and his contractor and sub-
contractor that one or all of them were
careless enough to allow a piece of wood
to drop from the second storey on to
the head of my client who was walking
below, thus causing him to have con-
tinual headaches and to lose several
weeks’ wages.

SIR. “Oz’s” evaluation of The Bul-

it is, “Oz” will not exclude The Bul-

Brian Buckley (8., Nov. 13), confines
his analysis of “Oz” to issues 5 and 6
(the current “Oz” is No. 23), which
perhaps explains why he ignores deroga-
tory allusions to Professor May and a
full-page condemnation of Vice-Chancel-

because, as a Letter to the Editor, it

Editors, “Oz”
SIR. While Mr Buckley’s assessment
of the worth of “Oz”, “Tharunka”, and
other works of the Mavis Bramston
school of humor is quite accurate
they’re all unprofessional, immature and
unfunny I disagree with him on
“Whisper” and “Drongo”. Obviously put
together by mature, if cynical, profes-
sionals, these magazines contain some
very funny, at times penetrating,
material. “Drongo” carried a story on
Japanese cars and a. fake “biography”
of an Australian film director that is the
funniest stuff I’ve read in years.
“Drongo’s” regular feature, “Axes &
Hatchets”, contains some of the finest
comedy dialogue since Lower. The
“kind of humor found in high school
magazines reinforced with double en-
tendre and cheesecake” is certainly there
but for the same reason that royalty
is featured so regularly on the covers of
women’s magazines and in our Sunday
papers. It sells. At least it is honestly
bawdy, without the nasty snide slant
given to exactly similar material by other
local publications. These two magazines,
incidentally, are entirely Australian in
content, and encourage younger writers
and artists by using their work and pay-
ing well for it. Is this not a good thing?

Wole Soyinka
SIR. Professor James McAuley has
received a cable from the International
Secretariat of the Congress for Cultural
Freedom informing him that Wole
Soyinka, the distinguished Nigerian poet
and playwright who visited Australia
in 1962, was arrested, has been
hospitalised after a period in gaol, and
faced the court last week (November 8).
It is not .quite clear whether the hospital-
isation is the result of treatment in gaol
or what the charges are. It is obvious,
however, that Soyinka was deprived of
the normal legal safeguards which assure
a fair trial, such as adequate time to
prepare one’s defence, etc.
Professor McAuley saw a play by
Soyinka at the Commonwealth Festival
in London which was very critical of
corruption in Nigeria but it is not
known whether this play was the direct
cause of persecution. In view of the
urgency of the matter the two editors
of “Quadrant”. Professor McAuley and
Donald Horne, cabled the Prime Minister
of Nigeria as follows:
“Gravely disturbed imprisonment
Wole Soyinka with short notice trial,
without time proper defence prepara-
tions. Please intervene protect fair
trial rights internationally known
fellow writer. Signed: James McAuley,
Donald Horne, editors “Quadrant”,
on behalf of Soyinka’s Australian
friends.”
Should you wish to add your voice
to the above protest you should address
yourself to Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa,
Prime Minister of the Federation of
Nigeria, House of Representatives,
Lagos.

Rasputin
SIR. —I was interested to read George
McGann’s New York letter “The Death
of Rasputin” (8., Nov. 6), but would like
to point out a couple of inaccuracies in
his comments on the Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer film that was the cause of a
former trial for damages. This film,
made in 1932 and directed by Russian
emigre Richard Boleslawski, was called
“Rasputin and the Empress”, not “Ras*
putin, the Mad Monk” as stated by Mr
McGann. Furthermore, John Barrymore
did not play Rasputin, a part taken by
his brother Lionel. The film was, in fact,
unique in that it featured all three Barry-
mores. Ethel appeared as the Czarina,
and John as “Prince Paul Chegodieff”, a
character obviously modelled on that of
Prince Felix Youssoupoff.

' TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

Old Mother England
SIR. Recently many of my Australian
colleagues and I were disturbed at the
publicity in London given to Prince
Charles’ coming term at Geelong Gram-
mar School. The overall theme created
by the various mediums was that Aus-
tralians are being dealt a great favor by
sending him to Geelong for a “toughen-
ing up” and character-building course. It
was said that Australians will riot in the
streets out of sheer jubilation and grati-
tude!
The reasons for this calculated act
of politics and heavy-handed public
relations seem obvious. Britain feels
that she must swallow her basic envy
of Australia and begin an all-out attempt
to woo us securely into her crumbling
Commonwealth fold She realises only
too well Australia’s incredible potential
and would seek to gain psychological
control over Australian minds and
policy. Thus the vague hints of Queen
Elizabeth eventually residing in Aus-
tralia. Thus the sending out of the
Royal adolescent. I only hope that we
are not blind to this kind of crass flattery.
Soon after it was announced that
Prince Charles would visit Australia,
Australians in Britain were forced to
endure some embarrassment due to the
pathetic and fawning speeches of grati-
tude, made by Menzies and his diplo-
matic band of mock-Englishmen. An
excerpt from one of Sir Robert’s speeches
reads: “. . this is a very tangible demon-
stration of the close ties between Aus-
tralia and the Royal family”. It’s about
time some of our politicians started
giving more stable thought to the wel-
fare of Australia (instead of claiming all
credit for the country’s inevitable post-
war success) and not their own egos, im-
mortality an titles.
Britain has been reduced to the status
of a parasite desperateh seeking potential
hosts. She would quickly jump on to and
try to take over the Australian band-
wagon if we were foolish enough to let
her. But close ties with Britain can only
impede our progress. We do not want
the international reputation of “the
country molly-coddled by old mother
England”, an image which it seems the
English would project to the world. We
have been left high and dry by Britain
many times in the past and can no longer
trust, or look to her for any kind of
support.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Adelaide’s Lost Generation
By TERRY STAPLETON
F3R the first time it is possible. Given
stamina and talent, an actor can
earn a living in Adelaide. The
Trust’s South Australian Theatre Com-
pany seems to be settling in with some
degree of tenuous permanence; thin
trickles of remuneration are possible
from ABC Radio (dramas and school
broadcasts), ad-agencies (TV and radio
commercials) and, in the most primitive
sense, ABC-TV drama. A good week
a nightly performance, a radio drama, a
commercial and a couple of schools—
could bring an actor £6O Not every
week, of course —and any serious illness
or incapacitation would mean disaster.
Therefore, would-be applicants are dis-
couraged from any indulgent luxuries
like dependants; marriage is dubious,
children impossible. A potential pro-
fessional should be very young, very
single and very healthy. The boards trod
by such people are more likely to be
surf than stage but, in theory, the way
is open.
Sadly, the way is almost closed to the
very people who, for the last decade,
have made the standard of Adelaide
amateur theatre a matter for national
admiration and considerable envy. John
Tasker, the SATC director, speaks wist-
fully of these people as “the lost genera-
tion”. Among those lost:
© LESLIE DAYMAN, who is prob-
ably Adelaide’s most versatile and flex-
ible actor. He brings, to any role he
cares about, total absorption and imagin-
ative invention. As “Volpone’s” Corvino,
he minced and strutted and fretted in a
sickeningly accurate, nastily funny por-
trait of the tedious cuckold. As “Cat on
a Hot Tin Roofs” Big Daddy, he some-
how survived ungainly padding, a real
but wrong beard and virus ’flu to achieve
a memorably imposing creation. His
Eddie Carbone in “A View from the
Bridge” was tremendously moving and,
more recently, in “A Season in Hell”,
he was morbidly meticulous with his
study of the tormented poet, Verlaine.
At 32, Dayman is tall and lean with
a worried face which seems to invite
tension and expect disaster. Off-stage,
he often appears almost satirically
neurotic: he nail-bites, fidgets, frowns
and paces in an exhausting continuum
of restlessness. But once on stage, he
sheds all uncertainty and insecurity to
become calmly assured, impressively in
charge of himself and the audience.
Dayman’s theatrical growth seems
likely to find him acting less, directing
more. He brings to his productions relent-
less research and consummate care.
As a director he is still finding himself
but the eventful search has already con-
tributed exciting productions of Pinter
(“The Birthday Party”, “The Caretaker”)
and Tennessee Williams (“A Streetcar
named Desire”, “The Night of the
Iguana” the latter was generally voted
the most absorbing dramatic production
of 1964's Festival of Arts).
• BARBARA WEST, who is 30-
something and looks a waif-life 22. Tiny,
with a sad and lovely face, haunting eyes
and the hairstyle of a careless teenager,
she can, at her best, hypnotise an
audience with all the disquieting mag-
netism of a lost and lonely child. Man-
chester-born and a LAMDA Scholarship
winner, Miss West has been in Adelaide
since 1954. Despite her established repy.
tation, she is endearingly uncertain and
tends to attack every part as though it
may be her last offer. A meaty role
becomes a total obsession; she will
analyse, review, dissect, probe and per-
severe until even the most concerned and
solicitous of directors begins to appear
somewhat glazed.
Her immense enthusiasm has not
always been tempered by discrimination;
too often she has had to survive un-
worthy parts in routine productions. But
as Gittel, “Two for the See - Saw’s"
memorable madcap, as Fuse - Hime,
“Toda-San’s” delicately charming Japan-
ese student, as Marion Castle, “The Big
Knife’s” long-suffering wife, as Shake-
speare’s Juliet and particularly as “Street-
car’s” Blanche du Bois, Barbara West
left no doubts regarding - the depth of
her talent. Her Blanche was a pressed
flower lovely, faded, fragile, doomed.
• RAY WHEELER, who is probably
Adelaide’s most experienced actor, has
a long and impressive history in drama,
revue and radio. This year he brought
off an adroit acting double in Peter
Shaffer's “The Private Ear and The
Public Eye” and directed a fresh,
imaginative popular version of “Much
Ado About Nothing”. In his mid-
thirties, Wheeler somehow combines the
appeal of an irreverent schoolboy with
that of an austere ascetic. His expression
shifts easily from serious sensitivity to
worldly cynicism to infectious delight
and his acting range is equally flexible.
Wheeler’s performance in 1959’s
“Waiting for Godot” is still remembered
with enthusiastic respect and, more
recently (1963), his garrulous neurotic in
Edward Albee’s “The Zoo Story”. An
actor’s actor, Wheeler achieves his im-
pact as the result of deep thought,
fastidious preparation and increasingly
careful selection.
• JUDITH DICK is in her late
twenties but can act anything from a
vicious, twisted schoolgirl (“The Child-
Shead at the Discotheque
"Excuse me, I've forgotten which one of you is my
girl-friend."
"'You ployed beautifully tonight, Maestro


ren’s Hour”) to a mumbling, carping
fusspot in her mid-eighties (“Billy Liar”)
and be revoltingly accurate at either
extreme. She was equally at home and
successful as Hannah, the infinitely ap-
pealing, dedicated idealist-realist in “The
Night of the Iguana”, or as Lulu, the
promiscuous, cheap dazzler in “The
Birthday Party”. Easily Adelaide’s most
versatile, adaptable and busy performer,
she shifts eagerly and often between
theatre, radio, films, TV and com-
mercials.
Off-stage she is totally un-actressy. If
any of “the lost generation” is suddenly
“found” to be a full-time professional,
it will probably be Judith Dick. She
seems likely to survive the pressures,
frustrations and disillusionments: She,
perhaps more than the others, has the
vital blend of dedication, drive, ego,
talent and ambition.
These, then, are the big four. There
are others nearly as good. In a society
of greater maturity and balance, many
of these people would long since have
become respected professionals, encour-
aged to pursue their art and develop
their abilities in an atmosphere of relative
freedom and material reassurance. In-
stead, for most of them, it is too late.
The men are all committed to respon-
sible, if often ill-fitting, jobs and have
the usual dependants. The women are
nearly all married, with children.
Of course, this is an all-too-familiar
tale the tragi-farce of the actor in
Australia. The plot varies slightly from
State to State, but for the above Adelaide
cast, it has certainly provided a very
nasty night’s entertainment.

What Makes Tommy Run?
By PATRICK TENNISON
In the week in which his doctor told
him he could not live more than
two years unless he slowed down,
Tommy Hanlon Jnr was more upset
about a Melbourne TV writer who
criticised him savagely under a “Go
Home, Yank” page-wide headline.
For bustling, quick-witted, folksy Han-
lon, critics have always been more im-
portant than doctors.
“Trouble is, I’m too normal to be in
this business,” he said, shaking his head
sadly at the mounting pile of woes. “It
needs someone with a hide like a rhino-
ceros. I’m tired of people writing that I'm
a moron and shouldn’t do things I do
the way I do them. The fact is, I just
don't know any other business or how to
do what I’m doing any differently. As a
performer I dont mind criticism. But
when it's destructive, it hurts.”
He admitted losing about 10 lbs in a
fortnight. But, despite his doctors’ warn-
ings—and he has consulted five in recent
months hoping for a more optimisitc
report he really has no intention of
stopping work, or even slowing down
perceptibly.
“Slow down? I can’t,” he said. “I'm
employed to do shows. My whole family
for four or five generations has been in
this business that says if people want you
to do shows you do them until you can't
any more. I’ve always set my own pace.
I take a perfectionist’s pride in my work.
I try to make every show I do the best
I've ever done.”
This drive has now lifted him to being
Australia’s most exposed TV personality.
His “It Could Be You” is seen five after-
noons a week on 22 stations. As well, he
appears several times each year in
“specials” or as substitute compere for
Graham Kennedy in GTV-9’s high-
rating “In Melbourne Tonight”.
“I'd rather live like a racehorse a
minute than a plough horse 30 years,”
is a saying he once heard from an Ameri-
can performer and which he has now
taken as his own style work-saddle.
Six years ago, midstream in his own
night-club comic career, he came to Aus-
tralia for club and TV appearances. He
“clicked”, particularly on TV. When
GTV-9's management dreamed up the “It
Could Be You” formula for a new show
it was contemplating, they offered Hanlon
the compere’s job. With the old trouper’s
pride, Hanlon points out that he has not
missed one performance in the five years
the show has been running.
In Melbourne, where it began, ICBY
quickly knocked out well-entrenched
opposition-channel shows and zipped
high in popularity and those all-important
ratings. Critics hate it and have slammed
Hanlon with the label of “sob-brother”.
“If they watched enough, they’d see
it s not a sobby show,” Hanlon said
angrily. “It is a human interest, daytime
show designed primarily for women
to let them see and meet other women.
Some of the cameos are funny and some
are sad. All life’s like that.”
Behind him in his TV work is a pro-
duction-research staff of 11. He is the
on-camera, front man towards whom all
their ideas and energies are channelled.
But, as well as front man, Hanlon is
also a major ideas man. His job entails a
lot of travelling, making personal appear-
ances or ICBY in other cities. Some weeks
he has appeared in three States. One
circuit had him working Monday and
Tuesday in Melbourne, Wednesday and
Thursday in Sydney, then a flip to Perth
on Friday and return to Melbourne on
Sunday only to re-start the regular
Monday morning taping of ICBY.
On plane trips like these he only
occasionally catnaps. He spends more
time chatting about plans and ideas with
members of his team or, when they
wear out, he reads papers and magazines,
always searching for ideas and jots down

something takes his eye and fancy. On

people, standing in the rain, all in one

He sees the medical warnings that he
is “coronary prone” as just more burdens
to add to a list that he would probably
feel anxious without. Having done a
steady flow of 1600 half-hour ICBYs he
likes seeing the impressive figure grow
larger. Rather than slow down, as the
doctor said he should, he is currently
working as well on two IMT specials. He
did 17 of these last year, taking a much
bigger hand in ideas, scripting and pre-
sentation than other IMT comperes do.
Talking softly but in his quick, clipped
yet slightly slurred way as he puffed on
one of the 60 cigarettes he mows down,
rather than just smokes, each day, he
summed up his feelings about the medical
amber lights displayed before him:
“I've never worked so hard before, but
that’s why I’m enjoying it so much. It's
not for the money and I’m not being
pushed by management.
“You can’t explain a thing like this.
You just feel it. I love what I’m doing
and as long as people like it too and
want me to do it, all I know is I have to
go on doing it for them.”

the surface “The Lesson” is an
hilarious farce about the absurdities of
arithmetic, the confusions of language
and the idiocies of the educational pro-
cess. But, as well, it is a grim allegory of
the acquisition of power.
At the beginning of the lesson the
elderly professor is polite and rather ner-
vous, while the 18-year-old girl pupil is
self-assured and very cheerful. Gradual-
ly the roles are reversed until the profes-
sor is harsh and domineering and the
pupil is passive and helpless. This trans-
formation is achieved by the power of
words. By a relentless rhetoric, delivered
with a great show of reason and erudi-
tion but in fact largely nonsensical, the
professor achieves complete domination
over the pupil.
Half-way through the pupil develops
toothache, seemingly as a protest against
the lesson, but the professor goes on talk-
ing mercilessly until he has worked him-
self up to such a frenzy of excitement
and fury that he murders the hypnotised
pupil with an imaginary knife. It is an
orgastic murder simulating rape, and
turns out to be the fortieth such he has
committed that day.
The attaining of power by confound-
ing people with floods of largely non-
sensical rhetoric of course brings the
Nazis to mind. This interpretation gains
support from the fact that at the end the
motherly housekeeper gives the profes-
sor a swastika armband to protect him
from the consequences of his crimes. In
his production Peter O’Shaughnessy has
substituted a Digger’s hat, but I doubt
that it has the same connotation.
Peter O'Shaughnessy gives an excellent
performance as the old professor, so
'earned yet so childishly wilful. His dev-
elopment from arithmetic to murder and
from humility to rape is skilfully man-
aged so as to be at once funny and

sinister. His performance is well matched
by that of Shirley O'Shaughnessy who,
beginning as a pert young lady becomes,
by way of the agony of toothache, a
hypnotised and almost inanimate victim.
“A Unicorn for Christmas” has no
particular distinction as a play, but it has
plenty of ingredients to appeal, to child-
ren. It is set in an old castle, there is
lost treasure, a charming young hero and
heroine, a nasty pair of villains and a
clumsy parson whose habit of falling
over everything delights the children.
There is also some historical glamor, for
the action switches back to 400 years
earlier and all the characters appear in
mediaeval costume.
Audience participation is provided by
two heraldic beasts the wyvern and
the unicorn who talk to the child-
ren between scenes and enlist their aid
with the plot. Noelann Gandon’s lively
production is well served by a very
competent team of actors whose obvious
enjoyment of playing for children pro-
vides a very pleasant atmosphere.

jokes, this one could have a serious mean-
ing. Part of the author’s skill lies in
keeping us guessing at what it might be.
Imagine a typical Pinter interior some-
where in London. There sits Max, the
father seal, cast in the bold likeness of
Frank Thring, an actor with happily
bull-like propensities. Max is a retired
butcher; a ranting, stooping, cane-sup-
ported mountain of meat with a brain
through which flit sentimental memories
of a wife who, in more lucid moments, he
recalls as a rotten slut. There sits his
brother, Sam, a taxi driver, & dullard and
coward, with tatters of cockney respecta-
bility clutched to his narrow chest.
There also sit Lenny and Joey, Max’s
sons, the stripling seals. Lenny is the one
with the glib and pretentious tongue, a
seedy cynic who turns out to be a pimp.
Young Joey would like to be a boxer.
Fear and rivalry hold them together: the
two juniors are not yet ready to destroy
their noble begetter.
For about 20 minutes they simply talk
—old-fashioned folk would say they are
establishing their identity. They carry on
somewhat like Mick, Aston and Davies
in “The Caretaker,” that is to say, they
half-communicate at the edge of a human
situation just sufficiently realistic to be
believable.
Then a pair of outsiders arrives and
we begin to discern an unPinterish
thing ... a plot. A third son, who
does not want to be a seal but a man,
takes his place on the slippery ledge. A
Doctor of Philosophy, Teddy has re-
turned from America with a wife in tow.
Ruth is a silent, mysterious, malcontent
woman who, we rightly suspect, will
prove to be the Lilith in this perverse
Eden. But not immediately, for near the
half-way mark a stronger, more original
motif seems to show itself. Teddy still
loves his brutal old man! His uncertain
and isolated intellect appreciates the
excremental warmth of the rookery. He
hopes Ruth will appreciate it too.
Ruth does, in her own way. Before
long we behold her stretched full length
on the couch beneath the boxer-brother’s
weight a rather nervously exhausting
piece of stage craft for the actors in-

A re you interested in the mating habits
of Antarctic seals? The publicity put
out for “The Homecoming” suggests that
it is a comedy written in the language of
zoologists reporting on the customs of
our thick-skinned friends. I am pleased
to say that the statement is not entirely
correct.
But it’s not wildly off the mark, allow-
ing for the fact that the seal is a fairly
articulate mammal with a one-track
mind, little concerned with the civilising
virtues of self-control. Mr Pinter’s people
differ from seals in that food-gathering
occupies only a fraction of their time,
and what distinguishes Mr Pinter from
the Life. Force which, presumably, makes
seals what they are is his ability to enjoy
a joke at his creatures’ expense. The audi-
ence also enjoys it, since, like many

hand, comes good with a proposal to find
a proper professional scope for her hori-

agrees. (If thL is giving the story away
no apology is required: the story element

doubtful, but I do not think it lies in the
realm of moral philosophy.
Production and acting maintain the
high level achieved by the other plays in
Mr Sumner’s Union season, though I fear
that Alan Hopgood (Lenny) is in danger
of being typed too severely. Frederick

conscious, with his speaking smacking
slightly of the drama school. Edward
Hepple has gained balance in the switch
from Maitland to Sam; Malcolm Robert-
son blends adolescent gauchery effec-
tively with male bluster in the character
of Joey, and the Ruth of Jennifer Claire,
the enslaving female principle, escapes
from an awkward shelter of silence into
the icy freedom of nymphomania as well
as the script will let her. The part of
Max must have been written for Mr
Thring.

TF[?] EVISION
Weak Bonds
Sydney television is bristling with spies
at present, to a degree not imagin-
able in the other States. Even Melbourne
programmes on the four channels are
innocent of things to come, such things
as watches and fountain pens which
become bombs at a flick of the thumb,
and organisations named UNCLE or
KAOS. The origins of all this are
obvious. We are watching James Bond
and his devices, and his enemies, in
various guises. There are also overtones
of Bond’s predecessor, the villainous Dr
Fu Manchu, honorable anti-hero of
yesteryear.
ATN-7 in Sydney is showing four
Bonds in as many shows, “The Man
from UNCLE”, “The Wild, Wild West”,
“Get Smart” and “I Spy”. The first
named has two operatives, in the frail
frames of Robert Vaughn and David
McCallum, working for United Nations
against the subversives of Thrush. Unlike
Mr Bond, and none the better for it,
these two are deadly serious, virtuous and
quickly triumphant.
In “The Wild, Wild West” Robert
Conrad of “Hawaiian Eye” fame is a
Presidential agenfc named James West
who operates during the last century,
mostly out of a two-car train equipped
as one luxury suite and one mobile
laboratory. The character here is closer
to Bond. But again time drains the
essence from the fun.
The producers of “Get Smart” decided
to concentrate entirely on bumbling.
Obviously no one could bumble more
effectively than Don Adams whose “Mr
Glick” in the Bill Dana Show has given
viewers a noble portrait of a hotel detec-
tive more likely to lose his shirt than
find a clue. But, as often happens, the
character who shines as a foil in one
series can become a studied bore in an-
other. Don Adams as Maxwell Smart,
the preposterous operative who whispers
pass words to startled children and makes
contacts on Santa’s knee can be very
funny once or twice, before ennui set*
in.
The fourth of ATN's spy ventures, “1
Spy”, features Robert Culp, previously
seen as a hippy sheriff, and negro Bill
Cosby, as two Government men whose
operations are closer to Allen Dulles’
“The Craft of Intelligence”, a proximity
which in its truthfulness manages to be-
come very dull spy stuff indeed.

Disaster Compounded
By T. B. MILLAR
One Minute of Time. The Melbourne -
Voyager Collision. Vice-Admiral Harold
Hickling. A. H. and A. W. Reed. 355.
At 8.56 p.m. on Monday, February
10, 1964, 81 men of the Royal
Australian Navy and one civilian dock-
yard employee lost their lives when the
aircraft-carrier Melbourne cut the de-
stroyer Voyager in half off the coast of
New South Wales. It was Australia’s
greatest peace-time naval disaster.
Vice-Admiral Hickling, a retired
officer of the Royal Navy, has produced
the first full, unofficial report of the col-
lision and the extraordinary Royal Com-
mission subsequently appointed, which
led to the resignation from the Navy of
Melbourne’s commander, Captain R. J.
Robertson, DSC.
The book is breezily written, with per-
haps a touch more salt in the wind than
some readers would like. It is a naval
officer’s unduly journalistic reconstruc-
tion, but with interesting illustrations and
analogies. It is, understandably, frankly
pro-Navy, at times giving the impression
of sliding over criticism. This is unneces-
sary, for the unvarnished story reflects
immense credit on the Service their
professional training, quick thinking and
great courage.
Without being disrespectful to Admiral
Hickling, one hopes that this is not the
last book to be written on the Voyager
incident. Yet, however many volumes of
interpietation are added to the 4000
pages of evidence given at the Royal
Commission, the full story of how the
collision occurred will never be known,
because key witnesses, especially the man
held principally responsible, Captain
D. H. Stevens, died tragically with their
ship.
CAPTAIN ROBERTSON
There are a number of other questions
which the author sets out to answer. The
first is what actually happened, and in
this he succeeds in detail and explana-
tion better than either the Royal Com-
mission or the newspapers at the time.
The second is whether a Royal Com-
mission should have been held, and al-
though he can see the political reasons,
Admiral Hickling believes that, because
of lack of naval experience, it could
never have succeeded in a competent
examination of the evidence. Having
read large sections of the transcript and
the report, I am inclined to agree with
the author.
Once it began hearing evidence, the
conduct of the Commission, and notably
of the Counsel “assisting” the Com-
missioner, Mr J. W. Smyth, QC, was
extremely disturbing. Mr Smyth ap-
peared to Admiral Hickling and to
many others to cast himself in the role
of Crown Prosecutor against the naval
witnesses (especially Captain Robertson).
Admiral Hickling quotes Senator Gorton,
a former Minister for the Navy, speaking
in Parliament:
“No Service has been so damaged
by a partial presentation of the facts,
and in some cases by completely un-
substantial presentation of the facts,
as was the naval service, which was
improperly damaged by Mr Smyth,
QC, during the course of the Com-
mission’s enquiry.”
The report of the Commission, which
ran to 51 pages, summarised the evidence
and concluded that the collision “was
not due to any fault on the part of any
person on Melbourne ”. Yet later in the
report, the Commissioner (Mr Justice
Spicer, Chief Judge of the Common-
wealth Industrial Court and a former
Liberal Cabinet Minister), wrote of Cap-
tain Robertson’s “inexperience”, and
criticised him and two other officers in
the Melbourne for not doing more to
avert the collision.
The Government accepted the Com-
mission’s report, giving weight to the
second of these conclusions rather than
the first. It refused to release the report
of the Naval Board, but presumably the
opinions of the Board were reflected in
the submissions of its counsel, Mr N. A.
Jenkyn, QC, and were very different
from the Commission’s.
Captain Robertson was relieved of his
command, and he subsequently resigned
his commission after 34 years of dis-
tinguished service. Because he resigned,
he was deprived of the very considerable
pension rights he had accumulated. Had
he compulsorily retired for in-
efficiency, he would have kept his
pension. This disgraceful action by the
Government went almost unchallenged
by Parliament or the Press. The Govern-
ment went almost unchallenged by
Parliament or the Press. The Govern-
ment thus retained its ability to enforce
conformity among all but the most in-
dependent or determined senior officers
by what is little short of economic black-
mail.
Lessons were, of course, learned from
this tragedy and have since been applied
throughout the Navy. Legal provisions
have changed to allow for different judi-
cial procedures in an inquiry into a dis-
aster of this kind.
Had the loss of the Voyager not fol-
lowed a number of naval accidents, there
may not have been the public outcry,
the political activity on both sides, and
the Royal Commission. Yet all these
were, in a sense, signs of immaturity, an
unawareness of the problems and risks
involved in maintaining a fighting service,
and an unreadiness to back up the officers
who carry such great responsibilities in
the defence of us all.

Spain’s 40,000 Volunteers
By DAVID MARTIN
[The International Brigades. Vincent Brome.
i Heinemann. 645.
/There has been more tendentious, lop-
sided and half-informed writing
from the outside about the war in Spain
to call it a civil war would be almost
la misnomer than about most other
'wars. One would expect this of the
material turned out during the years of
fighting, but it is as true of what has been
produced since. Hugh Thomas’s book was
only partly an exception; it, too, con-
centrated on the cloak-and-dagger
aspect, the Machiavellian. As to the Inter-
national Brigades, we have had a lot of
fancy mingled with a little fact, inverted
romanticism and hindsightful preach-
ments.
A book would have to be written to
the atmosphere and spirit of the
mid-’thirties, an understanding of which
is necessary in order to do justice to what
the Brigades were and did, and another
book to trace the mental climate of the
Hiroshima - to - Khrushchev period, to
make sense of the approach of some of
these alleged historians. What interests
them is not really the Brigades, how they
were formed, organised and gave battle,
but the aftermath, into which they pro-
ject speculations ranging from the sexy
to the cynical. Didn't the volunteers have
i a dreadful awakening? How many homo-
sexual commanders did they have?
(Weren't they a strange band of frustrated
poets, idealist intellectuals, OGPU men
and petty crooks, deceivers and deceived?
What effect on their outlook did internal
rivalries and jealousies have?
Nobody who was in Spain then would
deny that there were rivalries and blun-
ders; nobody who can read is unaware
that among the rank and file as well as
the leaders who survived a certain pro-
portion has become retrospectively dis-
illusioned. They were and are political
beings, and politics are not static. But I
should be surprised astonished if
the great majority of those who served
the Republic did not look back on their
(Service with pride. They did not save
Spain from fascism: non-intervention
saw to that. But until nearly the end their
struggle and sacrifices were far from
hopeless, and if it is worth proving with
an eye on the future, that 40,000 deter-
mined men from all over the world can
join for a noble purpose they proved it.
If Australians do not look upon Gallipoli
as a romantic failure now to be ashamed
of, how much less does the remnant of
the Brigades have to regret the past?
Never more than 20,000 were actually
>n arms at any one time. Probably less
than half the combatants were members
of Communist Parties, though in this sec-
tion of the army Communist influence
and leadership were decisive. (Not neces-
sarily as political commissars, for even
there a fair proportion were non-party
men.) In the mass army which was even-
tually forged on loyalist territory the
IB was by no means the most important
component, but right up to the Ebro
campaign it remained the nucleus of
shock troops, though widely dispersed,
around which the Ejercito Nacional could
develop. What gave the Brigades their
significance was discipline and cohesion
and the fact that it contained a fairly
high number of men with military experi-
ence. The Xlth Brigade grouped around
the heroic Thaelman Battalion saved
Madrid during the early winter of ’36,
and without the Brigades Franco would
have completed the encirclement of the
city before the end of spring. The Xllth
Brigade, especially the Garibaldi Bat-
talion, played a vital part in the victory
over Mussolini's Italians at Guadalajara,
but the Brigades were never strong
enough to mount or successfully spear-
head a major offensive. They tried at
Brunete, but were beaten by materiel.
Their power had to be used up to fill
breaches their deployment was almost
always tactical. Still, they did miracles
for morale and accepted losses which
would have destroyed more homogeneous,
more seasoned and perhaps better led
troops.
They fought Italian regulars, Moors,
the Tercio and the Requetes: the best the
enemy had. They did this with the
sketchiest of training and a very mixed
bag of weapons. They had language pro-
blems. Many had already spent years
in cruel exile and capture to them meant
mutilation and death. They were as good,
generally, in defence as in attack, though
they saw practically all their attacks
broken. They were still as steady in the
last retreat as in the first assault, if not
more steady than, say, Lister's, Modesto’s
or Campesino’s men. Such a force, surely,
demands at last a serious historian and at
least some intelligent analysis.
Vincent Brome is no historian but a
novelist and feature-writer; sustained
VINCENT BROME
analysis is beyond him and he is fas-
cinated by personalities and “color”. His
book has no maps. It jumps from engage-
ment to engagement like a flea on a dog’s
back. It has a bibliography which does
not mention two of the most interesting
books on the war, by Steve Nelson, and
Sandoval and Azcarati. It crazily mis-
spells the names of two prominent bat-
talions. He quotes from a report given
by Andre Marty to the Central Com-
mittee of the French CP in which this
admittedly discredited chief boasts that
the executions ordered by him —presum-
ably in the French formations —“did not
go beyond 500”.
This is simply laughable. The French
provided more soldiers than any other
nationality, but 500 executions would
have wiped out about three per cent.
One would like to study this extraordin-
ary report. Firing squads, near-mutinies
and desertions are Mr Brome’s meat and
drink. Especially desertions: he makes
much of those there were and at length
discusses a trend, noticeable for a long
time among the British, to take their
volunteer status too literally. He does not
mention that nobody remained a volun-
teer in this sense after taking the oath on
the colors in Albacete. Nor the fact that
the leadership had to keep in mind that
no home-leave could be given to
Germans, Italians, Hungarians and many
others. He tells us much too little about
the Slavonic battalions among the
finest and excuses this with reasons of
space. He does not review the institution
of commissars or their functions, does
not explain the fascinating differences
between the various nationality groups,
forgets about the foreign pilots who
opposed the Capronis and Messer-
schmitts and does not seriously look at
the workings of the chain of command.
The Brigades’ relations with the Spanish
authorities receives the scantest attention,
reactions to the POUM uprising is
outside his scope and the campaigns in
the south rate a few disjointed lines. (In
compensation he has discovered a river

called the Rio.) The splendid medical
service of the Brigades is entirely over-
looked. This is the book which has been
praised highly in England ... it requires
an M. H. Ellis to say what should be
said about such scholarship.
A good deal of the material has been
mugged from already well-known sources
and earlier collections, and the first sixty
pages are filled with tit-bits about Esmond
Romilly (11 index entries), the son of
the Haldanes, Charlotte’s own doings in
Paris and details of similar calibre. Later,
more justifiably, the story concentrates
heavily on the British and American con-
tribution, with overall balance nowhere
achieved. Two chapters are headed “Dis-
sent and Desertions” and “More Trouble
in the Brigades”, but no two consecutive
pages are given to armament, equipment
and logistics. Did the author visit the
battlefields? A nostalgic set-piece suggests
that he did, but then how could he write
that a Captain Aloca, of the XKlth
Brigade Cavalry, took off from Brunete
to head for the French frontier? Did he
have a winged horse or, more prosaically,
did he decamp for Barcelona some 200
miles away! Mr Brome is not a man of ill-
will. Some of his observations are stimu-
lating. there are a few good passages of
reportage, his sections on Belchite and
Teruel have the ring of authenticity and
here and there a picture does emerge of
what it was like to be a soldier. (But,
again, he lays it on about the waste of
food in the early months and says nothing
about subsisting chiefly on chickpeas from
Mexico and red wine during the final
stages, the body lice months.) All right:
a lively writer does not have to be C
true chronicler. But must he be an in.!
curable lover of latrine rumors and barely !
relevant anecdotes? Cecil Day Lewis once
wrote, with an honesty which compels!
respect, that fear prevented him from!
going to fight in Spain. Alas, that there!
is no fear to stop the unqualified writing
about war!
Many years after the event one rea-
lises that there was, among many other
things, something tragic about the Inter-
national Brigades ... as there was about
the siege of Troy. It was a war fought
in a twilight, and too many people got
emotionally stuck in the experience.!
Many intellectuals have been left bitter,!
but this was not a war of intellectuals,j
a point on which some perspective is!
overdue. If was a bloody and terrible!
war which, had it been won, might have!
prevented a still bloodier and more!
terrible one. A war, incidentally, in which
at least twenty-five Australians gave their

rp H [s book, by a novelist whose work
is still not well known in the English-
speaking world, in spite of his Nobel
Prize in 1946, is a welcome choice for

Hesse a sentence which claims that
Europe is sliding into a flux of irrational-
ism, a terrible but renovating and
creative Asiatic hysteria—amoral, intoxi-
cated, possessed—of which Dostoevsky’s
Karamazov family is a prophecy. Later,
in 1941, I picked up by chance a second-
hand copy, which I still have, of the
essays that Eliot quoted from, “Blick ins
Chaos”. My anarchistic “Blue Horses”
mood of those days responded with un-
easy attraction to Hesse’s invocation of
the powers of destruction and renewal,
his vision of formlessness engulfing the
“bourgeois” world of order and law, dis-
solving the boundaries between permitted
and forbidden: chaos as the condition
of creation.
Hesse’s acceptance by the English-
speaking public has been impeded by the
fact that he works in the tradition of
German romanticism, having kinship
with such various figures as Novalis,
Hoffmann and Eichendorff. He does not
write novels in the ordinary sense, but
tales which are fantastic, poetic, ironic,
symbolist, melodramatic—tales rooted in
the tradition of fairy-story and of
legends like the Faust-story. Such fictions
are used as vehicles for expressing the
warring opposites within the psyche:;
reason and passion, spirit and flesh,
and scepticism, vision and despair. They;
seek to reconcile clashing demands, orj
at least to divine a path of illumination
and hope. Their method is wide open
to pretentiousness, ambiguity, evasive-
ness and irresponsibility. But it is also
in touch with the psychic depths, capable
at times of a “magical” power as its
fabulations become charged with thej
electric force of our psychic dilemmas.
“Steppenwolf” is an outstanding ex-
ample of Hesse’s fiction. Published in
1927, it marks the extreme point of
Hesse’s own personal crisis and sense of
alienation. Its fantastic events follow
visibly the outline of Hesse’s ownj
troubles. Harry Haller is an intellectual!
whose gods are Mozart and Goethe. His
marriage has collapsed with the insanity
of his wife. He has incurred the wrath of
patriotic German society by denouncing
chauvinism. He withdraws from society,
maintaining a marginal existence as
an outsider, desperate, contemplating
suicide. He sees himself as a “wolf of
the steppes”, solitary, suffering from an
internal conflict between intellect and
feeling which he cannot reconcile. This
corresponds to Hesse’s own story. Even
the hero’s episode of sensual abandon
in a world of dance-halls, bars and
prostitutes corresponds to a strange
period, which Hesse has recorded in a
set of crude but revealing poems called
“Krisis”. Hesse’s turning to Freudian
psychoanalysis and also to Buddhism are
also registered in the story.

book a coherent doctrine or “solution”.
The tensions, ambiguities and contradic-
tions are set in motion by the story,
examined, but not really reconciled.
Through the mask of his alienated hero,
Hesse continues his attack on “bour-
geois” rationality, seeing it as a miserable
compromise or falsification. Instead he
tries to affirm two opposite poles of
value. On the one hand, he aspires to-
wards the pure realism of the spirit, the
point of view of eternity, of which
Mozart’s music is an earthly reflection:
here are peace, love, serenity, wisdom.
On the other hand, he seeks to liberate
all the suppressed selves which lie under
the ban of bourgeois conformity or
morality. As a kind of therapy, he acts
out —but only in imagination, in a
Magic Theatre to which he is admitted
by drugs all the forbidden impulses
within him. It is here that ironic-fantastic
fabulation in the romantic tradition is
given free play.
For instance, Harry .receives f rC m a
mysterious pedlar a booklet which turns
out to be an analysis of himself under
the title “Treatise on the Steppenwolf”.
Here, incidentally, the Penguin edition
lets us down: in the German text this
booklet is separated from the rest of the
work by red cover-papers and set in a
different, old-fashioned type. Penguin
Books have been able thriftily to resist
this enhancement of the fantasy, to the
[reader’s loss.
Even in the Magic Theatre episodes,
the different “acts” or “shows” that
Harry can choose are set out as notices
on doors, like this:
enclosing “box” around these inscrip-
tions — a small loss, but regrettable.
What Hesse did not succeed in facing
in this work can be expressed by pointing
out that genuine “wolves of the steppes”
are not timid, solitary, harmless neuro-
tics. They hunt in packs, they are greedy,
aggressive, criminal marauders; they kill
and eat the innocent and unwary. The
liberation of suppressed impulse by the
dissolution of the boundary between
right and wrong, permitted and forbid-
den, is not a therapeutic fantasy-game
but an appalling reality. After 1933,
Hesse was forced by the spectacle of
the real Steppenwolfishness of the Nazis
to reconsider his relation to society and
the cultural tradition. His pacifism,
internationalism and spiritual sensitivity
ensured that he utterly rejected the Nazi
debauch. In his retreat in Switzerland he
became one of the witnesses to the
existence of the “other” Germany, and
this is doubtless why he got his Nobel
Prize.
In his long work “Glasperlenspiel”
(Game of Glass Beads), published in
1943 and translated as “Magister Ludi”,
he makes a significant shift The struggle
to reconcile the old tensions is still there,
but there is a new stress upon the need
to conserve the gains of reason, to pro-
tect and continue the European heritage.
Hesse imagines an organised intellectual
authority called Castalia, an order of
intellectuals dedicated to safeguarding
the norms and measures of civilisation.
The glass-pearl game is a symbolic
operation, akin to the ritual diagrams of
the Chinese “Book of Changes”.
Hesse, like many other German artists
and intellectuals, experienced deeply the
tug towards irrationalism and the abyss.
One may not always be satisfied with the
form of their eventual recognition of the
danger, or their mode of resistance; but
it is very important that they did not
succumb to the siren-monsters that
sang of the fruitfulness of chaos.
A Little Night Piece
I
Take the evening from the sky:
Color starts to peel away:
Brittle shavings, hard and dry,
Streak the robin’s-egg of day;
And silence underscores the sound
Of stirrings in the trees around
W hose papery leaves are gray.
II
Night thickens, and the amber brook
Hows like ink, with gleams of gold.
The solitary bird becomes a rook.
Hunched as if the air were cold.
The garden Hermes glimmers white
As much of day, as much of light,
As the night-struck eye can hold.
111
When the cloven eye is pierced
By the statue’s snowy shaft
Light and dark are seen reversed:
A marble streak is all that's left
Of day engulfed in Stygian dark.
The pulsing glow-worm’s greenish spark
Is day of all but light bereft.
IV
The eye’s the navel of the mind:
Such little lights when light is sped
Are points upon a graph assigned
To trace the locus in the head
Of lines that bound the world of things
And clip the monster Chaos’ wings
That fill the night with dread.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
McEwen's Strong Words
A USTRALIA’S Minister for Trade, Mr John McEwen, used strong words in Japan
recently when he said if there was no progress in the next 12 months in the
Kennedy Round for tariff reductions, then he did not see any prospects for reduction
thereafter. He didn’t sound very hopeful.
The major industrial nations are still
plugging for a reduction in tariffs on
manufactured goods, but the agricultural
nations are battling to make any head-
way in selling their primary products.
It is apparent that, unless the under-
developed nations can sell more of their
agricultural products, they will not be
in a position to absorb an increased flow
of industrial goods.
Mr McEwen said that Australia seeks
reasonable access to markets and re-
munerative prices for those goods we
produce efficiently. Other nations seek
the same thing; not all of them produce
efficiently.
Japan has hammered the line that
Australia should give it the same pre-
ferential treatment on tariffs as is enjoyed
by Britain. Mr McEwen countered by
saying that Britain had made an offer
of a full linear cut of 50 p.c. in her
tariffs (presumably if there are cor-
responding concessions in return).
He also pointed out that Australia’s
trade is sensitive to the movements and
prices of four major buyers Britain,
Japan, the Common Market and USA.
Therefore, it was a matter of self-interest
that those who sell to us must give us
satisfactory access to their markets and
satisfactory prices to enable Australia to
pay for its imports from those countries.
While Japan expressed fears about
possible tariffs on the increased flow of
Japanese cars to Australia, Mr McEwen
said that the imbalance of trade was
altering rapidly, with Japanese exports
to Australia rising by 50 p.c. last year
while Australian sales to Japan fell by
10 p.c.
Perhaps Mr McEwen’s statement in
Japan on the Kennedy Round summed
up the future of tariff-cutting negotia-
tions when he said he could not see much
hope after 12 months.
At this stage no one seems willing to
give way. Indeed, it should be said that
in many cases most nations cannot afford
to give way unless they achieve com-
pensating sales.
The trade area for Australia certainly
is swinging geographically towards Japan
and the East, yet the hard fact emerges
that the agricultural industries of both
countries appear to be relatively in-
efficient by world standards while Japan
continues to forge ahead in her industrial
capacity.
It seems that two important trading
partners like Japan and Australia should
sit down and work out what each can
reasonably afford to do for each other.
A bit of “give” on both sides would not
be amiss, considering that both countries
have mutual Interests.
Anti-collusion
are a lot of valid reasons for
Australian industry to oppose the
introduction of legislation on restrictive
trade practices and there is no doubt that
some anomalies inevitably will occur.
However, the public also must be con-
sidered. It is no use denying that restric-
tive trade practices do occur.
Perhaps it is true that Australia’s
existing Industries Preservation Act could
be brought up to date, yet there are the
inevitable problems of getting each State
to amend its legislation to agree with the
Federal law. Already constitutional law-
yers see a stumbling block in the con-
flicting opinions already expressed by
State governments.
Perhaps an example of what might be
achieved is the recent case of Franklin’s
EISAKU SATO
Prime Minister of Japan.
Ply Ltd, the grocery chain, which claim-
ed that manufacturers in NSW stopped
supplies of chocolate when Franklin’s
cut prices below the list price (for
example, from 2s. a bar to Is. 91d.).
It appears that the action was taken
by an association of Commonwealth
chocolate and confectionery manufac-
turers, since when Franklin’s has gone
interstate for other sources of supply.
The interesting part about all this is
that the association is said to have placed
the embargo on Franklin’s and not the
individual manufacturers. Had the manu-
facturers individually refused to supply
Franklin’s, it is possible they may have
been infringing the existing Act.
Under the proposed Trade Practices
Bill it is possible that an association
could be accused of collusive dealing.
British and American Share Markets
JjHODESIA should apparently mean
more on the London share markets
than on the Australian, where last week
the prospects for copper stocks were prac-
tically the only factor needing to be taken
into account. Yet London almost suceeded
in giving an impression of having over-
come most Rhodesian investment implica-
tions. There may still be some doubt as to
how much had been discounted earlier
and all of the financial issues are certainly
far from resolved. The actual UDI, how-
ever, did not excite the markets unduly.
What price falls there were seemed
mostly to occur among stocks with direct
Rhodesian interests. Though these particu-
lar declines served to disturb the very real
firmness existing at the beginning of the
week, their spread was not extensive.
Two other influences helped to hold a
large range of industrials on a reasonably
even keel. October's trade figures fully
exemplified the Board of Trade's prior
optimism. Then came some almost flamboy-
ant statements about North Sea gas.
After consideration, the effect of these
latter was finally confined to oil and gas
heating shares. There followed a further
announcement of a gas strike by Conti-
nental Oil, so industrials received a fairly
wide stimulation.
Most prominent of the stocks im-
mediately brought back by Rhodesia were
ICI, Associated Cement, Unilever and
BMC. The general equity picture, however,
continues to be strengthened by a moder-
ate scrip shortage and greater institution-
al interest.
Wall Street has been conveying a some-
what irregular appearance following a
mild retreat from its run of peaks. Many
analysts would appreciate the corrective
tone, if such it is.
But Friday again produced a positive
advance for the day, on a considerable
volume as well. The usual profit-taking
barely touched the advance. Electronics
and motors led stocks in high demand.
Steels were significantly easier.

Mr Holt “Delineates”
Planning Limits
Government and the economic dialogue
IN trying to explain that the Government wasn’t hostile to planning in his address to
the Australian Institute of Management conference in Canberra last week it was a
bit unfortunate for the Federal Treasurer, Mr H. E. Holt, to pick on Canberra itself as
his first illustration of its activities in that direction.
Coining the phrase that ours was a “co-
operating democracy”, Mr Holt went to
some lengths to show that planning went
on in all Government departments and
that this was supplemented by innumer-
able cogs in the general wheel. Yet he
still left the impression that in some way
or other the Treasury thinks of itself as
the hub of the wheel and will brook no
rival such as the Vernon Committee
threw up as a key suggestion in its
report.
As for the Vernon Report itself, this,
said the Treasurer, obviously wanting to
take some of the sting from the PM’s
earlier criticism, was part of the overall
process the provision of a reservoir of
information from which, presumably,
the Government would drink but not
get drunk on. The last thing the Govern-
ment wanted was a rigid prescription for
an economy which, subject as it is, the
Treasurer explained, to the vagaries of
the seasons, world price fluctuations and
so on (this was the burden of his song
in Melbourne recently), needed a flexible
economic policy approach. Coining an-
other phrase, we have to be “light on
our feet”, Mr Holt said.
All that the Government could guar-
antee to the business world would be
to speak clearly and emphatically on a
number of key economic matters such as
fiscal and monetary policy to prevent
uncertainties. For the rest it would let
internal economic activity run on under
the influence of free market forces. The
pattern, if not the overall level, of de-
mand would be governed largely by con-
sumer preferences, not Government dic-
tation except where it was necessary to
establish national priorities. The Govern-
ment would hope to exert its influence in
the mitigation of pressures on resources,
but not perhaps expect to attain perfect
stability. Summing up, the Government’s
planning would be of “a broadly delineat-
ed character”. (The Treasurer was full of
telling phrases that morning and in his
best public form for a long time.) Advice
would be piecemeal, wherever the Gov-
ernment thought fit. It would hope for
more and more from the business world.
Yet an Economic Advisory Council, no.
With Professors Downing and Arndt
both appearing on the panel, understand-
ably the Vernon Report, which covers
much the same territory as the subject
of the conference, was very much in the
swim of the discussions, or the “economic
dialogue” as Mr Holt, in another new
phrase, dubbed it.
Before his early departure from this to
get back to the House, Mr Holt showed
he was fully in sympathy with the main
target, as seen by the Vernon Committee,
to get the best out of the economy in
the next decade that is, to get an
annual growth rate of about 5 per cent
at constant prices. This is, in fact, in line
with the Government’s target of a
growth of 25 per cent in the five-year
period to 1968, as stated in its election
programme of 1963. One of the pre-
requisites would be to get exports mak-
ing up to something like the levels en-
visaged by the Committee for 1975 (how
on earth anybody can say what level ex-
ports are likely to attain in 1975 defeats
me). As Mr Holt said, it certainly looks
as if we have established “a new plateau
of export achievement” in the last two
years and, with minerals and manufac-
tures coming increasingly into the picture,
the long-term outlook for exports is
healthy. Saying nothing about the short
term, the Treasurer may be keeping his
fingers crossed. On the longer term he
said the “export position should strength-
en materially”.
As for productivity, the Vernon Com-
mittee projected an increase of 2.7 per
cent a year (coupled with an annual rise
of 2.3 per cent in the work force, this
gives the 5 per cent growth target). The
two economics professors seemed to
agree that this might be difficult to get
in terms of the conventional measures of
growth, which they claim understate the
growth of productivity in tertiary in-
dustries into which an increasing amount
of resources is bound to be directed in
the next decade at the relative expense
of manufacturing, where productivity
(conventionally measured) has been in-
creasing much more rapidly. For Down-
ing at any rate, getting the required
growth rate presupposes a bigger effort
to increase productivity in non-tertiary
industries at an even higher rate than
envisaged by the Vernon Committee.
For this reason Downing advocated
getting rid of some of the more
inefficient manufacturing industries and
concentrating on the expansion of
the more productive ones. The former
would include much of the low-grade
textile industry. The same would have to
be done with some of the less productive
primary industries such as dairying, which
is a drag on overall productivity increase
despite the primary industries as a whole
having the highest rate of productivity
growth. Downing had no doubt that the
tertiary industries would get an increas-
ing share of resources. If this meant a
lower than expected growth rate in con-
ventional statistical terms we would have

to put up with it, because it would con-
form to what consumers (as they get
richer) want. Perhaps Mr Holt wouldn’t
worry overmuch, either, at the implica-
tions for statistical rates of growth.
Switching to another aspect, Mr B.
B. Callaghan, managing director of the
Commonwealth Banking Corporation, told
the conference that a much bigger effort
would have to be made to marshal local
capital to the task of financing the envi-
, . j . , , ,
saged growth. In the process he brought
to l.fe that much-neglected (by the public,
anyway) flow-of-funds information col-
lected and collated at the Reserve Bank.
This shows that in recent years the total
amount of capital investment in physical
assets in the economy was about the same
in each of the three main sectors (per-
sons and unincorporated enterprises,
governments, and companies). Here is
something we will have to come back to
on another occasion. Its implications for
the task of capital marshalling are
all that obvious.
As with other speakers, Mr Callaghaf
placed great emphasis on the modernist
tion of our capital equipment as an essetij

Prospect in the Philippines
Barriers to Australian trade
its publication of lan Shannon’s “The Philippines: Australia’s Neighbor”, 11,
Committee for Economic Development of Australia provides an hors d’oeuvrt
for what promises to be the full and satisfying meal it is preparing on Australia’s
relationship to economic development in South-East Asia.
Valuable though it is as a basis for
understanding the main lines of relation-
ship and as an introduction of the
Philippines to Australians, perhaps
neither Shannon himself nor CEDA
would pretend that this study is more
than a very tentative assessment of the
possibilities of bringing the two countries
closer together commercially. “Together-
ness” is not by the wildest stretch of the
imagination at all close at the moment.
On Shannon’s showing, about the only
thing we have in common is a high
degree of commercial involvement by
United States business interests. Admit-
tedly pervasiveness of the Americans in
the Philippine economy is more decisive
than in ours, but we are definitely catch-
ing up.
As any Australian manufacturer who
has tried to get into the Philippine
market will tell you, the US has had
it by the throat practically since Mac-
Arthur “returned”. An eighteen-year
seal was set on this ascendancy in 1956
by the Laurel-Langley trade agreement
with the United States. Other importers
can only be thankful that the discrimina-
tion against them has gradually been
watered down under the terms of the
agreement and is now more tolerable.
The margin of preference for United
States imports has been reduced front
75 per cent at the beginning of th|
agreement in 1956 to 10 per cent thi
year, and will remain at this level unti
the termination of the agreement in
1974. Shannon has curiously failed to
give any account of the effects of thi.
arrangement on Australian trade andji
indeed to examine trade between the*
two countries at all. His only comment)
is that from 1965 onwards Australian'
exporters will have a much better chanctl 1
of competing with the United States ill l
the Philippines.
He could have shown that already the
progressive reduction in the preferences
has helped our exports. For instance,,
since 1959 when they were reduced from
75 to 50 per cent and further to 25
per cent in 1962, our exports to the
Philippines have actually trebled. Theyj
now embrace a much wider range of
products, even if at £10.4 million the)'
were pretty well unchanged in 1964-65
from the previous year and still represent
only a small fraction of our total exports
What seems most interesting to me »•
that so many new products have been
able to get into the market, if only or
a small scale. Going through the details
trade returns, one finds not only sub-
stantial increases in our tradition!

exports such as malt (the biggest, at
£1? million last year), butter, cheese and
milk, flour, zinc and lead, frozen and
tinned meat, tallow and grains in the
last five years, but also many others
which reflect the growing export con-
sciousness of manufacturing industry
here.
Some of these, like aluminium
louvres, adding and computing machines,
welding machinery, abrasives, scientific
instruments, twist drills and pumps, still
fall short of £lOO,OOO a year. But others,
such as printing paper, drugs, mining
and other machinery, iron and steel,
motor components, cables and batteries,
are ranging much higher. All told, they
represent a catholic collection of old and
new export counters.
However, before running away with
the idea that we can get much farther
in our market penetration of manu-
factured goods in the Philippines, there
are some obvious reservations to make.
Shannon points to Japan, which is on
the country’s doorstep, as being a ready
contender for honors in the market.
Equally, as with British imports here,
the US has a built-in advantage in the
Philippines market through its owner-
ship of so much of the country’s
industry. This gives it a leg in, irrespec-
tive of preferences and competitive
costs.
One of Shannon’s main angles on
this is that rural incomes must be lifted
from their present impoverished level.
“It is quite probable that there are two
flashpoints in the Philippine economy,”
he states; “if one concerns the mal-
distribution of income, then the other
must surely be the pitiful agricultural
production.” Another is that the country
sorely requires more economic aid from
overseas.
“As matters now stand it would seem
that foreign private capital investment in
the Philippines will remain at a depres-
sed level. This does not augur well for
the future, since a great proportion of
the most important industrial develop-
ment schemes (from the point of view of
economic development) are extremely
capital - intensive and beyond the
resources of Philippine capital. The
potential includes the development of
mineral resources. But since transport,
electricity and other facilities are also
limited, the exploitation of many natural
resources is not a commercially viable
proposition from the point of view of the
individual corporation. Again the argu-
ment comes back to the need for more
economic aid to supply a greater spread
and range of social overhead capital
items such as roads, railways, ports,
water and power.
“Yet even if the Administration suc-
ceeded in making the investment climate
much more attractive this would not
necessarily mean a huge' flow of private
capital to the islands. For one thing,
there are many other countries seeking
foreign private capital. For another, the
Philippines is a small country, with a
Gross National Product which is only a
fraction of that in many of the more
populous underdeveloped countries such
as India, Brazil and Mexico.”
Proceeding from there, the author says
“but from the Australian point of view
there are some advantages in selecting
the Philippines as one of the relatively
few countries likely to be a base for
Australian international commercial
investment.” Unfortunately he fails to
enumerate these advantages; elsewhere
in his references to the Laurel agreement
he seems to hint that we would at least
have difficulty in competing with the
United States in getting an investment
stake in the Philippines.


HIGHLIGHTS OF CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
RUMEN Hill SOOTH MED
360 COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA
The Chairman of Broken Hill South Limited, Mr. G. Lindesay Clark,
in his address to stockholders at the Company’s annual general
meeting on Monday, November 1, 1965, said:
Mr. G. Lmde.sav Clark
FINANCIAL. The consolidated net
profit of the Broken Hili South
Limited Group of Companies
increased to £A2,3 79,000, and
the net profit of the parent
company to £A2,134,000. A divi-
dend of 9d. per stock unit will
be paid on December 3, 1965.
FUNDS FOR CAPITAL WORKS.
Capital works including funds
required for the Cobar Mines
copper and Alcoa of Australia
aluminium projects contributed
in the form of subscriptions for
shares required £A3.127,000
during the year, of which
£A2,252,000 was generated from
internal sources in the same year.
The call on the South Company's
funds for Cobar and Broken Hill
development projects should
diminish after December 1965.
OPERATIONS AT BROKEN HILL.
It is intended to mine and treat
225.000 tons of ore at the South
Mine. To offset the lower rate
of ore production, 80,000 tons
of residues containing an esti-
mated 11.4% zinc will also be
treated for the production of
zinc concentrate.
Construction is well advanced
on a new plant having a capa-
city to re-treat at the rate of
270,000 tons per year residue
dumps containing recoverable
lead minerals on the Company’s
leases. The first dump treated
will be Mt. Hebbard, estimated
to contain 750,000 tons assaying
approximately 3.0% lead, 3.0 oz.
silver/ton, and 5.0% zinc and
650,000 tons assaying approxi-
mately 2.5% lead, 2.0 oz. silver/
ton and 3.5% zinc. Treatment
is scheduled to begin during the
latter half of 1966 calendar year.
Considerable effort is being
maintained on exploration within
the mining leases at Broken Hill.
A decision has been made to
drive the 2,400 feet level from
No. 7 shaft.
GGBAR. Ore production from the
C.S.A. Mine commenced on
schedule in July 1965. In the
period to 23rd October, 63,271
tons of copper ore from the
eastern and western ore bodies,
assaying 2.13% copper had been
milled, and the copper concen-
trate produced despatched to
Port Kernbla for treatment. Re-
coveries of copper and grade of
concentrates have been most
satisfactory.
Performance of the underground
equipment being used for ore
extraction has also been satis-
factory. The main winder on
No. 2 shaft will be ready to
operate shortly when production
will gradually increase to the full
output capacity of the first unit
of the concentrator.
Development on the 1.200 ft.
level and from the declines at
the 1.300 ft. and 1,400 ft. hori-
zons, and on the 1,800 ft. level
has disclosed extensive lodes of
pyrific copper/zinc ore, between
the two copper lodes. Similar
type ore has been located at a
depth of 2,500 feet.
The increase in mine potential
following development of the
copper/zinc ore will require a
review of mining policy as it is
apparent that substantial produc-
tion of zinc as well as copper
can be maintained.
EXPLORATION. In the Broken Hill
district. Broken Hill South
Limited has, under the Agree-
ment with North Broken Hill
Limited and Electrolytic Zinc
Company of Australasia Limited,
continued testing the Mutooroo
prospect where geophysical data
has indicated mineralisation ex-
ceeding 8,000 feet in length.
Drilling to date has tested ap-
proximately 2,500 feet of this
length indicating a tabular lode
of horizontal width of 50 feet of
marginal grade copper. Drilling
is being continued.
Exploration in other districts
In other districts in the Com-
monwealth of Australia, Broken
Hill South Ltd. has carried out
mineral exploration under the
Agreement with North Broken
Hill Limited, Electrolytic Zinc-
Company of Australasia Limited
and McPhar Geophysics Limited
of Canada. This includes drill-
ing at Kanmantoo, South Aus-
tralia. which is ' showing wide-
spread mineralisation but grade
has been low; at Kapunda,
S.A., where a wide lode channel
but with low copper values has
been located; and in Queensland
and New South Wales.
Broken Hill South has a 90%
interest in exploration being
conducted in the vicinity of a
former tin mine at Mt. Bischoff,
Tasmania, and also over a pros-
pecting area of some 780 square
miles in north-west Tasmania.
The company has maintained its
30% interest in exploration in
the Moonta district of South
Australia, and since the close of
the year has announced its par-
ticipation to the extent of a one-
ninth share in a programme of
base metal prospecting at Fraser
Range, Western Australia.
Non-Metallic
Broken Hill South Ltd. has ex-
tended its exploration for the
more important non-m etaliic
minerals, and the search for
phosphate deposits is being un-
dertaken at three locations where
testing is justified.
BEACH PETROLEUM N.L. Through
its 17.5% participation in Beach
Petroleum, the Company has
taken an interest in oil and gas
exploration. This has included
drilling in the Simpson Desert in
the Northern Territory, and in
the Stansmore Ranges in Western
Australia under farmout arrange-
ments. Structures are being as-
sessed by Beach Petroleum for
eventual drilling in South Aus-
tralia and New South Wales.
THE ELECTROLYTIC REFINING &
SMELTING COMPANY OF
AUSTRALIA LIMITED. The E.R.&S.
Co. reported a net profit of
£457,000. Extensions to its con-
tinuous casting plant are being
planned, in continuation of the
considerable improvements made
to the facilities in the past year.
ALCOA OF AUSTRALIA. Alcoa of
Australia is now producing high
grade commercial sheet and com-
mercial foil. Extension of the
alumina refinery at Kwinana,
Western Australia, by 200,000
metric tons capacity, making
410,000 metric tons per annum
capacity, is progressing satisfac-
torily. The whole of the further
output will go to satisfy the con-
tract with American Metal
Climax Incorporated of New
York requiring delivery to be
commenced in April 1967.
Work has begun on the 150
megawatt electric power plant at
Anglesea, Victoria.
Consumption of aluminium in
Australia is expanding and
Alcoa of Australia believes steps
now being taken will ensure
steady growth towards levels of
consumption in other advanced
industrial countries.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Costs of the Reserve Plan
L. A. Simpson versus Dr Parish
DR R. M. PARISH, writing in “The Bulletin” (Oct. 30, p. 59), very obviously over-
looks one most important fact that has regularly been a pattern in countries
already operating reserve price schemes for wool marketing.
j The point overlooked by Dr Parish is
(that only a small percentage of the
wool on which a reserve price scheme
makes a “bid” is allowed to pass to the
(authority making that bid, for the trade
[takes most of its wool at a price higher
'than the reserve. From a woolgrower’s
point of view, therefore, all the wool on
which the authority is required to “bid”
because it has not reached the
I reserve price is increased in price
because of the authority’s presence in
the market.
■<. Opponents of the reserve price scheme
admittedly argue that the commercial
bidders purposely refrain from bidding
so as to ascertain the reserve price, but
this theory is invalid because the majority
of the wool that is “bid on” by the
marketing authority is sold at above the
'reserve price.
The best example, of course, is 1960-
61 in South Africa, where the following
were the figures (taken from the Philp
Report, page 174):
Bales
[Total offerings 1,045,333
(Authority bid on 392,212 or 37.5%
|of this quantity:
;!. Trade took at reserve 98,716 9.4%
5. Trade bought at above reserve 174,770 16.7%
3. Growers retained 14,034 1.4%
4.. Taken over by Commission 104,692 10.0%
' We therefore see that, in a country
that operates a reserve price scheme and
jin one year actually “bought in” just
'over 10 p.c. of her clip, in doing so
!the authority raised the price of a
further 9.4 p.c. of the clip to the reserve
price, merely by making a bid, and raised
the price on a further 16.7 p.c. of wool
above the reserve price, again merely
by making a bid.
. Therefore if Dr Parish or any other
opponent of reserve-price marketing for
w °ol talks of Australia’s buying-in 10
pc. of her clip, the woolgrowers, the
(Persons vitally concerned with this
(scheme, should realise the immense bene-
jfits that will accrue to the growers apart
(from the wool actually bought in.
f Whilst Dr Parish considers that the
[Wool Board’s method of costing is not
Quite as it should be, any person making
detailed examination of Dr Parish’s
costing” will realise that his figures are
a distortion aimed at “pulling the wool”
over the growers' and other people’s eyes.
First, with administration costs,
which Dr Parish finally reduces to
£384,623 per annum: these costs are
over the entire wool clip and on the
whole wool clip amount to less than
1/18 of a penny per pound, not one
penny per pound as quoted by Dr
Parish.
If the authority does buy in 10 p.c.
of any one clip, it will be quite certain
that at least double this amount (20
p.c.) will be raised in price by the opera-
tion of the scheme. If this 20 p.c. is
raised in price only one penny per
pound then, as far as the growers are
concerned, the whole of the administra-
tive costs are paid for five times over.
Dr Parish, in his clumsy attempt to
belittle the Wool Board’s costing, con-
veniently doubles the expenses (wool
will be held for a year on the assump-
tion used but charges for two years
are made).
The total cost of the scheme could
therefore be better set out (first assum-
ing no buying-in) as:
Administrative cost £384,623
Loss of interest to growers on
interest-free loan of £3om. and
£sm. contingency fund at 6 p.c. £2,100,000
£2,484,623
Less interest received by authority
on £3sm. at 4 -p.c. £1,400,000
£1,084,623
The scheme would cost, on these
figures, less than one-sixth of a penny
per pound of our wool clip.
In this connection it is interesting to
note that the computer exercise taken
out by the Wool Board over the whole
of the 1962-63 wool clip revealed that
841,073 bales sold at below the price
they would have made under a reserve
price of 54d. Had these bales of wool
made the reserve price, then growers

C <sfo*u/rr/ unJht
ONE OF THE WORLD'S 5 GREAT WHISKIES
would have received an extra €3m. more
or enough to pay all expenses for
three years. These figures do not allow
for the fact that a lot of the wool bid
on would have made more than the
reserve price.
Assuming some wool bought in, the
actual charges then applicable to the
bought-in wools will be buying costs,
storage, handling, insurance, reselling and
interest, plus 1/18 of a penny per pound
.for administration. However, as we are
only “allowing” interest of 4 p.c. this
would be the amount chargeable to the
scheme for the total of the growers’
funds, when subscribed.
Until the growers’ “bank” is subscribed
we know we will be paying short-term
Bond rate (at present 5 p.c.), with a
minimum of 43 p.c., but during this
period the cost of the scheme to the
grower is less as he is not “losing” inter-
est on so much money. If, of course,
the value of bought-in wool exceeds
£3om. we will then be paying 53 p.c.
interest, but a £3om. bank will allow for
a 9 p.c. “buy-in” at a reserve price of 54
pence.
The cost, assuming 10 p.c. wool
bought in at average price of £63 ss. pet
bale, will be
Buying cost .35d.
Selling cost 1.65 d.
Interest and insurance
holding charges 2 96d.
Administration cost .05d
5.01 d.
On these figures interest is charged at
5 p.c. on £3om. and 53 p.c. on balance,
but it will be remembered on the growers’
“bank” we were only allowing 4 p.c.
Therefore,, when the growers’ bank of
£3om. is subscribed, interest charges
as above could be reduced by .4 of a
penny.
Dr Parish will no doubt be startled to
learn that on one point at least we are
in agreement. This is that some more
definite indication should be given as to
the level of reserve price. On this point,
however, it would seem that the reserve
price must be set initially at 53d.—give
or take a penny—or between 52 and 54
pence.
The average price for the last four
years has been 57.5 d. and for the last
three years 62.2 d., so that on the four-
year average a 52d. reserve is 10 p.c.
below the average; on the three-year
average the 52d. reserve is about 20 p.c.
below the average price. On a reserve
price of 54d. it is some 6 p.c. below the
four-year average and some 13 p.c. below
the three-year average.
Indications at this moment of time point
to the average for the present season be-
ing somewhere between the three-year
and four-year averages. Therefore a range
of prices set on the some 300 individual
types of wool comprising the Australian
clip to give a reserve price between the
52-54 d. range can well be seen as the
ultimate starting point.
Dr Parish
Replies
'VTo one would deny that, when a reserve
price authority buys in wool and
hence reduces the supply available to the
trade, it causes the price of all wool sold
to rise (or, if not all wool, at least wool of
the types which it is purchasing). Simi-
larly, and this is the point neglected by
Mr Simpson, when the authority sells
wool, it exerts a depressing effect on
market price. Whether the price-raising
effect of the authority’s purchases is likely
to exceed the price-depressing effect of its
sales is a question which has been much
debated by agricultural economists, and
one to which no conclusive answer can
be given.
What I do deny is the assertion that

the price-raising effect of the authority’s
purchases can be measured by the sort
of statistics on bidding quoted by Mr
Simpson. The New South Wales Graziers’
Association has explained the fact that
both the NZ and South African Wool
Commissions bid on many more bales of
wool than they purchased as being due
to buyers “holding off” bidding in order
to discover the reserve. Mr Simpson says
this explanation is invalid because most
of the wool bid on by the Commissions
is sold at above the reserve price. I pre-
sume that he is arguing, as others have
done, that for buyers to hold off bidding
in order to discover the reserve implies
collusion among them, and if they col-
lude for this purpose, why don’t they also
buy collusively at the reserve price?
In fact, holding off bidding in order to
ascertain the reserve price does not imply
collusion, but merely common prudence,
on the part of buyers. Suppose you
attended an auction and knew that the
seller had placed a firm reserve on all
offerings of the commodity being sold
and that supply probably exceeded de-
mand at the reserve price. I submit you
would be very reluctant to pay a price
higher than the reserve, since you would
realise that, at least at some stage in the
auction, you should be able to purchase
your requirements at the reserve price.
You would also realise that there was
little point in competing with other
buyers, since there was more than enough
of the commodity to satisfy all demands.
You would hold off bidding until the re-
serve had been declared. If buyers hold
off for fear of bidding much higher than
the reserve, their initial bids are likely
to be lower than they would otherwise
be and the apparent price-raising effect
of the authority’s intervention would be
exaggerated.
Mr Simpson claims that I am “pulling
the wool over the eyes” of readers by
expressing administrative charges as so
much per lb. of wool bought rather than
spreading this charge over the whole clip.
Since the whole purpose of the proposed
authority is to buy and sell wool, it is
appropriate that it costs the charge to
the wool it buys and sells. Even the Wool
Board acknowledges this, since in its cost
estimates it uses the same procedure as
I use. It is clearly necessary to charge
two years’ fixed costs to a buying and
selling cycle spread over two years. Far
from constituting a “clumsy attempt to
belittle the Wool Board’s costing”, my
procedure here is again identical with the
procedure used by the Board in its cost
estimates.
One interesting point which does
emerge from Mr Simpson’s cost estimates
is the fact that I under-estimated the
cost of the scheme by failing to charge
interest on the contingency fund of £5
million.

A New Buffel Grass
Suitable for sub-tropics
Molopo is the name of a new buffel
grass which seems destined to be-
come well-known throughout sub-
tropical Australia. In field trials on the
Queensland Department of Primary In-
dustries’ Biloela Research Station it has
proved hardy, high yielding, and well
liked by cattle. Even more important is
its ability to remain leafy, green, and
palatable during winter. In this season
cattle are generally quite unable to main-
tain normal growth, much less fatten,
on the existing pastures of central and
southern Queensland. Molopo, and an-
other very similar buffel developed by
the CSIRO at Lawes, could give beef
production in these areas a considerable
boost. If a suitable legume could now
be found for the sub-tropics, Australia
would likely become the chief“supplier to
the world’s beef market.
The New South Wales Department of
Agriculture was actually first to recognise
the potential of this species. That depart-
ment first grew it more than 20 years
ago on its Experiment Station at Trangie,
where it performed creditably. Later
trials at Scone and Temora led to its
gaining a reputation for cold hardiness
that other tropical grasses such as green
panic and other buffel varieties could not
match. The NSW agricultural scientists
knew it under the name Cenchrus cHiaris.
In 1958 they imported for testing what
seemed to be a new buffel listed as
Molopo in South African seed catalogues.
Only after the first plants had been
grown from the imported seed did they
realise that Molopo was the very same
buffel that they had studied years before
and which meanwhile had been under-
going further testing on Biloela. The
grass was first collected along the
Molopo River in Western Transvaal,
South Africa. This river rises near Mafe-
king and flows through 10-20 inch rain-
fall country whose general latitude, 26
deg. S., approximates that of Gayndah
and Taroom in Queensland.
The main problem at the moment is
the seed supply. Molopo does not appear
to be a prolific seeder. It tends to yield
well the first year, but in following years
little or no seed is set. However, this is
not always so. For instance, a three-
year-old plot produced 200 pounds of
seed per acre from two hand harvestings
one in late January and the other in
mid-May. Seed setting seems to be
sensitive to soil moisture and nitrogen
levels. These possible influences will be
examined more closely at Biloela as soon
as possible. Another possible difficulty
stems from its strongly rhizomatous
habit. It could, therefore, be troublesome
and hard to eradicate from crop land,
at least in the higher rainfall areas. This
aspect will also be studied further. How-
ever, these doubts are unlikely to sup-
press a variety of buffel which over the
last four years has outyielded all others,
with the exception of the Lawes variety,
by at least 27 p.c. and which has a
protein content as good as any other.

SATISFACTORY DEMAND FOR LEAD.
ZINC AND SILVER
Steady year forecast by North
Broken Hill Chairman
The Annual Meeting of North Broken Hill
Limited was held in Melbourne on Thursday,
October 28, 1965.
Mr. M. L. Baillieu was Chairman.
Highlights of the Chairman’s speech were:
Financial: Referring to the company’s profit of
£4,115,000 for the year, which was a record,
Mr. Baillieu said that £3,155,000 came from min-
ing operations, and £960,000 from investments.
Mine expenditures rose from £3,642,000 the pre-
vious year to £4,255,000. More development work
had been done but the greater part of this rise was
due to higher rates of lead bonus payable, together
with labour cost increases.
Royalty and taxation amounted to £4,368,000.'
Revenue Increase: Mr. Baillieu said the reason for
the increase in North Broken Hill’s revenue in the
year under review arose from higher prices received
for lead and zinc concentrates. The return from
lead concentrate depended on the price of silver as
well as that of lead. Of the three metals produced,
lead was the company’s most important revenue
carrier. The average realised price for lead for the
year ended June 30, 1965, was £AI37/0/7d.
Lead Production: Tonnage of lead produced for the
year was 65,300 tons (69,700) and tonnage sold was
60,700 tons (72,900). Statistics indicate that lead
consumption was being well maintained, and unless
there was a major decline in world trade the rela-
tionship between supply and demand of recent months
should continue for the present financial year.
Zinc: North Broken Hill’s zinc was sold on a basis
of a producer price determined by a number of
leading producers in an endeavour to minimise
price fluctuations. Since September, 1964, the pro-
ducer price had remained at £Stg. 110 a ton.
Silver: Mr. Baillieu said that silver was in good
demand and there was every indication that it
would remain that way.
U.S.A. President’s Decision: The Chairman said
that the decision of President Johnson to remove
quotas on lead and zinc from Australia into U.S.A.
was a statesman-like move that must benefit world
trade in these metals by facilitating their free flow.
The decision was also realistic since there appeared
to be a reasonable balance between world con-
sumption and production of lead and zinc.
North Broken Hill Ore Resources: After discussing
the company’s activities in testing the continuation
of ore bodies at depth, including diamond drilling
below the No. 30 level (4,120 ft.), Mr. Baillieu
stated that although a firm decision had not yet been
taken, it was probable that the deepening of No. 3
shaft below its present depth of 4,320 ft. would be
commenced within the next 12 months. The deepen-
ing of No. 3 shaft would be of great importance in
the long-term life of the mine.
Exploration of Northern Leases: As part of a
thorough exploration of the Northern leases, drilling
has been carried out in an area some 2,000 ft. long,
approximately three miles north of No. 3 shaft. Ore
encountered occurred in lenses or pods. Diamond
drilling would be continued to determine whether
ore deposits of economic size and grade were present.
Other Exploration: Exploration had continued in
various parts of Australia by the several exploration
syndicates in which North Broken Hill was interested,
v * »
■ ' :
Compressed air operated loader shifting broken ore under-
ground at North mine
and by its own Exploration Staff. As part of syn-
dicate exploration under the direction of Broken
Hill South an area of relatively extensive copper
mineralisation was under examination at Kanmantoo,
S.A., where drilling was continuing in an endeavour
to establish ore reserves, and at the Mutooroo Mine
property south of Broken Hill four encouraging
drilling intersections of copper mineralisation had
been made at 1,300 ft. over a length of 2,000 ft.
North Broken Hill had interests in exploration in
the Kimberleys and the Ravensthorpe district, W.A.,
and since the end of the year at Fraser Range some
125 miles south-east of Kalgoorlie; also in prospect-
ing for gold in Victoria.
Oil: During the year Beach Petroleum N.L., in
which North Broken Hill had a 32.5% interest,
concluded a farmout agreement with Ameranda
Petroleum Corporation of Australia Limited, in
respect of an oil prospecting licence in the Simpson
Desert area of the Northern Territory.
Since the end of the financial year another farmout
agreement had been concluded with Australian
Aquitane Petroleum Pty. Ltd. in respect to the
Stansmore Ranges area of W.A. where that com-
pany is now drilling the Point Moody No. 1 Well
in the southern extension of the Fitzroy Basin.
Drilling was planned in the near future on Yorke
Peninsula (S.A.) and a drilling target had been
located on the Menamurtie Dome in western N.S.W.
B.H.A.S. Project: Reviewing North Broken Hill’s
important investments not listed on the Stock Ex-
change, Mr. Baillieu referred to The Broken Hill
Associated Smelters Pty. Ltd. in which North
Broken Hill had three million £1 shares. Of par-
ticular importance was B.H.A.S. decision to install
a plant to treat current molten slag from the blast
furnaces. Plant for this project required a capital
outlay of £6 million, and it was hoped to complete
construction in 1967.
Alcoa of Australia: North Broken Hill held 12%
of the capital of Alcoa of Australia Proprietary
Limited, which had gone a long way towards the
integration of its aluminium production facilities.
Capacity of the refinery at Kwinana, W.A., was
being increased to produce 410,000 tons of alumina,
following the long-term contract to supply 200,000
metric tons of alumina for export.
At Pt. Henry the aluminium smelter achieved its
planned capacity of 40,000 tons of metal each year.
Other Important Investments: Mr. Baillieu also
referred to the company’s 1,647,778 shares in Metal
Manufactures Limited, and North’s holding in Elec-
trolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia
Ltd., which had paid a 5% dividend, and which
had spent £1,000,000 on plant to handle Cobar
copper concentrates. He said that the Common-
wealth Aircraft Corporation, in which North Broken
Hill was a shareholder, had again achieved satis-
factory results for the year, both financially and
in production. 154286


How to Export a Bandit
Poker machines flourish overseas
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
T>OKER machines are big business. This year the New South Wales Government
is expected to take between £7 million and £lO million in royalties from the
State’s 15,000 “bandits” installed in more than 1300 clubs. The players themselves
are expected to be relieved of something like £5O million.
Since the legalisation of poker
machines in NSW in 1956 (they were
only “tolerated” before then), clubs’
profits have soared almost unbelievably,
royalties to the State Government have
jumped from £1.5 million in the first
20 months of operation to last year’s
£6.5 million, and the coffers of the
manufacturers have swelled considerably.
Nine years after the legalisation of the
“bandits”, the local market is still boom-
ing with new clubs, all after machines,
being established at a quick rate. Now,
too, the Australian manufacturers have
their eyes, as they have had for some
time, on export, aqd getting a greater
slice of business in the United Kingdom, .
the United States, Europe and Asia.
Without doubt one of the larger and
most influential of the Australian poker
machine iar ufacturers is Ainsworth
Consolidated Industries Pty, of Rose-
bery, NSW. Ainsworth at present domin-
ates the local market and is more than
holding its own with American and
Japanese manufacturers in a highly com-
petitive export field. For the past four
years this :ompany has operated a manu-
facturing plant in London.
Another large Australian manufacturer
to operate a plant in London is Nutt
and Muddle Holdings Limited, of Rush-
cutters Bay, Sydney. This company has
had its proverbial foot in the door in the
United Kingdom for approximately the
same time as its competitor. It can be
reliably reported that these two com-
panies are earning about £stgl.s million
from their European operations alone.
lhe obvious reason for the upsurge
of interest in selling to the United King-
dom has been the relaxation of strict
regulations under the Gaming and Bet-
ting Act. Poker machines, or fruit
machines as they are better known in
England, were legalised in 1961, with
provisions for Id., 3d. and 6d. machines.
However, these were limited in payout
and each club was allowed a maximum
of two. Last month the Act was amended,
still further relaxing these restrictions
and allowing the fruit machines to be
used in amusement parks, fairs, pubs,
cafes, subject to the control of local
government.
Competition for machine sales in
Europe and the United Kingdom is
sharp, particularly with the number of
American and Japanese manufacturers
contesting the market. Remarkably
enough, the Australians have gained a
high reputation and are at last beginning
to capture much ground from the Ameri-
cans and Japanese. The Australian-
designed machines beat the American
machines in price (in Australia these
machines sell from between £4OO and
£500) and hold both the Americans and
Japanese, their only real competitors, on
quality In fact in the past few years
Australia has exported more than 500
“bandits” to America home of the
poker machine.
The Japanese manufacturers only re-
cently blotted their copybook. Previously
the Japanese had gained a reputation for
quality. Now they have smartened up
their archaic designs, with a subsequent
loss of quality. The American machines
have not won for themselves an alto-
gether wonderful reputation, because of
mechanical failures.
It is here that the Australians are
winning. Quality, design and condition
are keynotes Each machine leaving the
countrv is carefully checked mechani-
cally and mc.nually. At Ainsworth a
machine is “pulled” 7000 times on an
assembly then rechecked manually for
another hour.
Australian poker machines have
popped up in most unexpected places.
Numbers of these machines can be found
in American officers’ clubs in operational
areas, particularly in Germany. As yet
no Australian machines have been sighted
in any of the officers’ clubs in Vietnam,
although maybe it’s only a matter of
time. (According to one American
psychologist for the fighting man a poker
machine plays an important part in
relaxation.)
Ainsworth has made a killing in Scan-
dinavia. Last year the company sent 400
machines there alone. Another of its
more spectacular achievements was the
sale of 400 machines to the Golden
Casino in Reno. The Sahara Hotel in
Las Vegas also sports a number of Ains-
worth’s machines.
Nutt and Muddle has also had an
impact on overseas markets. It, too, has
sold to Scandinavia and to the casinos
at Gibraltar. “We’d sell machines in
Antarctica if there was a market,” Mr
John Muddle told The Bulletin last
week. Nutt and Muddle, unlike Ains-
worth Industries which maintains a rep-
resentative in the United States, retains
marketing consultants in Asia to in-
vestigate the potential of the Asian mar-
ket. According to Nutt and Muddle’s
chairman, Mr J. H, Peoples, this has
been explored in some detail and the
company is extremely optimistic. Mr
Peoples points out that exports now
account for almost 50 p.c. of the com-
pany’s turnover.
Nutt and Muddle can boast of being
among the first of the Australian poker
machine manufacturers. In 1936 the late
Sid Muddle and the late Roy Nutt
teamed up, selling and hiring American
and French poker machines, pin-ball

machines and other types of amusements.
But in 1946 the National Security Regu-
lations imposed by the Federal Govern-
ment prohibited the import of such
machines. Subsequently the two men
turned their hands to manufacturing.
Ainsworth, at first a manufacturer of
dental equipment, entered the poker
machine field during the “illegal period”
and actually manufactured its first
machine about 1950.
The greatest problem in the business is
keeping abreast of new developments
and of requirements both in Australia
and overseas. Suggestions of electronic
machines, to replace the manually-
operated ones, have been fully investi-
gated. Earlier this year one small manu-
facturer marketed an electronic machine
but with little success.
Ainsworth's marketing director, Mr
** A. E. Allman, recently returned from
a two-month business jaunt to London,
America and Sweden, thinks there may
be something in the suggestion of elec-
tronic machines “We don’t believe that
the electronic machine itself was a failure
—only the way in which it was made,”
Mr Allman said. “Certainly when a satis-
factory electronic machine can be
designed, we will produce it.” Nutt and*
Muddle feels, however, the personal
element is taken away by electronics and
the machines are rendered far less attrac-
tive to the player.
Last August a Sydney manufacturer
announced a “computote” system of
machines. Basically this system totes
jackpots from a bank of ten machines.
A percentage of the money fed into the
poker machines is deducted. This is auto-
matically added up by the computer in
a growing jackpot, shown on a large
indicator panel. With all ten machines,
for instance, working continuously, the
jackpot will grow at a rate of about £3O
an hour. It is calculated that three aces
will come up on one of the ten machines
after 8000 pulls—or hours with all
machines working. This will give a jack-
oot of about £75. If by chance three
aces did not appear on any of the
machines for, say, three days, a jackpot
could climb to £5OO.
One of these computote systems was
installed in the City Tattersalls Club in
Sydney. After a trial period the club’s
committee decided to discontinue it.
According to club officials, in the first
three days the computote paid out £l2OO.
On one Wednesday, normally a slack
day, club members pulled the handles of
the ten machines 43,000 times, which
meant that the turnover for the day was
£4300.
The company manufacturing the com-
putote is still optimistic about its chances.
The managing director says his company
has spent more than £75,000 developing
the computer. This executive believes a
million dollar market may await the
computote in America; already there have
been inquiries from the big gambling
establishments in Nevada.
Three months ago 30 Japanese “five
play” machines were installed in a few
Sydney clubs. These machines take up
to five one-shilling coins for each pull
and pay out on the number of coins used.
But the Chief Secretary, Mr Willis, saw
the obvious fault from the Govern-
ment’s viewpoint: tax on these machines
would have been paid at the rate of
£lOO instead of the £5OO liable on five
shilling machines. Mr Willis issued a
statement which was interpreted as a
warning to clubs not to import or use
these machines. Since then nothing
further has been heard of them.


BOND'S INDUSTRIES LIMITED
ADDRESS OF THE CHAIRMAN, MR. W. RUSSELL SLADE, PRESENTED TO SHAREHOLDERS
AT THE ANNUAL MEETING ON WEDNESDAY, 3rd NOVEMBER, 1965
Ladies and Gentlemen,
As the results for the year have been pub-
lished in the Press and are more particularly
detailed in the Published Accounts and in the
Directors' Report, which have been sent to you,
I only wish to add a few brief comments.
The Group Net Profit of £444,302 was £46,935
or 9.6% lower than the previous year although
sales for the Group were the highest on record.
Profits were affected by dislocation or normal
production flow in bringing the new spinning
mill into production and by the removal of plant
from Dri-Glo to make way for new equipment.
Whilst this programme continued, it was not
possible to offset the substantial rise in wage
costs'which occurred during the year with corre-
sponding production efficiency.
By reason of the higher value of plant installed
during the year, which is subject to the 20%
first year income tax investment allowance, the
provision for taxation was considerably lower
than in the 1963/64 year.
Over a two-year period the Company has com-
pleted its record programme of plant develop-
ment.
Funds required to strengthen the manufacturing
efficiency and general production, which is para-
mount to the Group's ability to grow with world
trends of mass production and developing auto-
mation, were obtained from profits, depreciation,
and provisions as well as from the sale of fixed
assets and the realisation of investments which
are £336,373 lower than twelve months ago.
These funds and the increase in trade creditors
and accrued expenses of £109.876 have been
applied to meet capital expenditure commitments
for new and replacement plant and buildings
£738,573, increase in stocks £355,454, higher
trade debtors £79,216 and for the payment of
income taxes and dividends.
By increasing the provision for bad debts by
£20,000, your Directors are satisfied that ade-
quate provision has been made.
The higher value of stocks on hand was mainly
due to a build-up of basic lines and seasonal
goods to meet the budgeted increase in customer
demand.
BOND'S SPINNING MILLS PTY. LIMITED
The new Spinning Mill is the largest project
undertaken by the Bond's Group and, as such,
the most costly to bring into operation. Engineer-
ing of this modern plant requires a new concept
in values taking into account the high initial
capital cost of equipment, the necessity for air-
conditioned buildings and the cost of training
labor.
This Mill employs a high percentage of em-
ployees who have migrated from other countries.
Most come to us without previous textile experi-
ence, under conditions of labor scarcity, creating
a major problem in cost and in maintaining
production volume. We are not alone in this in
Australia. Those sections of industry engrossed in
re-equipment and expansion are most affected.
It is the price of developing an industrial nation.
The installation is now complete, enabling
energetic action to be concentrated on bringing
efficiency to its designed capacity. The Company
should benefit from this mill's operation, during
the 1965/66 year as predicted by the Board.
Production from this mill has not been able to
meet the increased demands for yarn by associ-
ated companies. Sizeable purchases are being
made from Australian spinners to satisfy this
requirement.
BOND'S-WEAR PTY. LIMITED
Sales for this subsidiary were an all-time
record, which has special significance, for through
Bond's-Wear our brand names and goods are
known to the. public. The major projects an-
nounced last year are now complete.
The Continuous Bleaching Plant was the most
demanding technical assembly to bring into full
production. This is Australia's first unit and, as
such, care with initiative had to be taken by our
technical staff. Both old and new plants were
kept in operation, which of course was costly, but
was a necessary insurance against an operational
breakdown. The plant now runs well.
You will enjoy seeing the Knitting Mill, which
is included in the Plant Inspection. This unit is
in the building constructed by George A. Bond
for Australia's first cotton spinning and towel
mill. The reconstructed building now houses Aus-
tralia's largest knitting plant, most of which is
new. The Division will benefit from being close
to its cotton yarn raw material supply. This is
a moderate saving only, but the working condi-
tions are more congenial and are on one floor.
Most people associate Bond's name with the
production of basic garments only. This is not a
displeasing image, for it is the great strength of
the Company. However, the Company is now
merchandising many fashion styles with success.
The challenge to our ingenuity in the styling of
selected sportswear, for example, is highly stimu-
lating. Sales in this field are climbing with us in
both men's and women's wear. The "Shoreline"
range of women's swimsuits was introduced and
although production was on a modest scale, the
good market reception will enable the new Gos-
ford Factory to accept larger orders for next year
when necessary cost saving production methods
can be introduced. This will only be done pro-
gressively for the policy of increasing the volume
of output is deliberately restricted. So far the
emphasis has been on the building up of a com-
petent production unit for high quality swimsuit
manufacture Baby Bond and Junior Bond sales
were introduced in the same conservative way,
but we are now confident of our position and
very good progress has been made in this Divi-
sion for the year. Production is now running at a
volume sufficient to make Bond's a real factor
in this field.
Prices of some of the Company's basic garments
had to be increased after some prices had been
held as long as ten years. The step was taken
most reluctantly, but there comes a time when
scarcity of labor, shorter hours, and rising wages
—without corresponding increases in output—
compel action.
DRI-GLO TOWELS PTY. LIMITED
The Dri-Glo re-equipment programme was on
schedule with the completed installation of many
new looms and ancillary equipment. Production
was affected by older looms being removed to
make way for new plant. Output was restored
and is now at record level.
The labor position at the Dri-Glo Mill is holding
back this Division's progress. We are therefore
developing a new mill at Lithgow in two stages,
commencing early 1966 and during 1968. The
building will be constructed by the State Govern-
ment to the Company's design and I wish to
acknowledge the co-operation of the State
Government and its departments. The Lithgow
Council's enthusiastic assistance and welcome to
their city has made us feel very much at home
with them. Our best skill is now being devoted
to planning a technically balanced mill for spin-
ning and weaving. The steady increase in Dri-Glo
towel sales necessitates production from the new
mill by the end of 1966. On completion this
project will be the Company's largest unit outside
the Wentworthville mill. It is doubtful whether
machinery for the Lithgow project will be a capi-
tal expenditure charge in the 1965/66 year
because of the possible delay in delivery. How.
ever, finance from the Company's own resources
will be available during the coming year in the
event of an early delivery of the plant.
A training school is now being operated by
the Company in Lithgow where towel looms have
been installed. The scheme should enable the
Company to commence operations in the new
Lithgow mill with a nucleus of local residents
who have had preliminary training experience
and who can assist others from the district in
becoming proficient in the industry.
COMPUTER
In January, 1965, a Honeywell H2OO Com|Ju.
ter was installed. Photographs of the general
view of the layout of the computer system and
comments on the capacity and applications of the
computer are shown on page (1) of the Annual
Report 1965.
During the relatively short period of opera-
tion, the benefits obtained have been mainly due
to speedier processing data resulting in earlier
reporting which is a desirable aid to Manage-
ment.
Our future plans for developing programmes
include production control for the Company's
factories, which on completion will have ma|of
benefits to the Group.
EXPORT
People in the Pacific area know and ask for
our products. We are servicing this area directly
with encouraging success. Sales in New Zealand
for Dri-Glo towels now warrant a resident repre-
sentative and showroom in Auckland.
Sale of bulk unbranded goods is of little
interest to us. Our policy is to sell branded
goods So that retailers and the public overseas
may know the Company better we had Waratah
Films produce a film entitled "The Bond's Story"
and this has been shown in New Zealand, the
United Kingdom, Fiji, and other Pacific Islands,
The response has been highly encouraging with
requests for more showings. You will have the
opportunity of seeing this film immediately after
the meeting.
Whilst on export, it is appropriate to mention
that the Research Department applied for patents
on three devices during the year. It was our first
intention to hold these within the Company, but
on reflection it was decided that they could be
worthwhile foreign currency earners for Australia.
Our Photomet. for example, was shown at the
Atlantic City Knitted Arts Exhibition. Agents have
been appointed in the United States, and the
United Kingdom. Sales are developing. The two
other developments are being field tested in the
United States by one of the world's largest sew-
ing machine manufacturers who have shown keen
interest in taking up manufacturing rights.
WARATAH FILM PRODUCTIONS PTY LIMITED
Such diverse attention is required for this
project that your Directors consider it too dis-
tracting from the main goals of the Company
within its present field. Production.of films there-
fore closed in March 1965. The film series con-
tinues to be offered for sale on the overseas
market. Although limited sales have been made
locally and overseas, it is still too early to know
whether the investment will be a success or not.
As stated last year, adequate provision has been
made to cover this risk. The Commonwealth
Government's verdict on its investigation to assist
the film industry was not given during the yeaf-

NAME
ADDRESS
STATE
couragement is given to all employees of the
Company to join this excellent scheme.
The planning and bringing into production of
the many new projects throughout the Group
has required most energetic service from a select
group of men and women. To them and to all
our employees, I convey the thanks and appreci-
ation of the Board for their efforts and work.
THE FUTURE
The internal economies of most Western coun-
tries are geared to give their people unparalleled
purchasing power, and their foreign currency
reserves are often in a state of crisis. Australia
is not an exception. We too are faced with con-
tinual run down of overseas prices and the effect
of the drought This of course is having its marked
effects on the economy. As a counter measure,
Australians have the challenging task to effec
tivelv develop the known and latent resources
of their country. The source of capital, technical
skill and migration to make this task effective
will influence our country for generations. Aus-
tralians own this Company, which has a respected
depth of knowledge in manufacturing and
merchandising.
The days of glorious isolation are past, our
Company has liaison with modern development
centres. We are constantly surveying the horizon
of technical improvements, through our own re-
search, by regular visits to International Textile
Exhibitions and by frank and friendly discussion
With a carefully selected group of leading over-
seas textile authorities. This attitude will continue
ond probably intensify.
Whether we like it or not, the industrial atmos-
phere is one of mass production, technological
change, computers and growing automation,
which has little respect for the inefficient. With
this environment in mind, the programme for
development and increased efficiency was under-
taken. The Company is in a strong position to
develop its market, dependent on the general
“Uoyancy of Australia's economy.
INVESTMENT
Assistance to Subsist
Costs in the gold industry
Comments in the annual report from
Great Boulder Gold Mines confirm
thoughts that the recently liberalised Gold
Mining Industry Assistance Act will not
make very much difference to a lot of
producers as far as higher profits are
concerned. Rather it will act as a buffer
against the rising costs which have been
eroding profits, and enable the producers
who participate in the scheme to halt this
downward earnings trend.
In Great Boulder’s case, no profit
improvement is expected the manage-
ment is concerned about the impact of
projected increases in rail freight charges
and industrial insurance in WA. These
come on top of a severe labor problem.
In 1964-65, the underground work force
chalked up :.n amazing turnover of 297
p.c. This and the shortage of skilled
miners accounted for the drop in profits.
Labor turnover above and below the
surface averaged the equally amazing
figure of 107 p.c. In all, 704 men were
employed during the year and 792 left
one of the highest turnovers on record.
The turnover and the shortage of skil-
led miners were the main reasons for a
12 p.c. increase in ore production costs.
The decrease in ore mined caused sharp
falls in the tonnage treated and hence
brought about an 18 p.c. rise in ore treat-
ment costs. In an effort to improve the
percentage of gold extraction, finer grind-
ing and additional reagent techniques
were adopted. These added further to
ore treatment costs.
The accounts show the group is claim-
ing £310,000 under the Act for the latest
year. After taking this into account, pro-
fit for the year was £152,000, down from
£263,000 previously. At balance date,
ore reserves were 68,000 tons lower at
1,934,800 tons, while the grade was
down .07 dwt to 5.18 dwt a ton.
All these factors illustrate that in-
creased assistance will do little for Great
Boulder except offset rising costs for a
time. There seems little chance of the
company’s returning to its former self.
The case may be a little extreme in
relation to other producers, yet all have
the same basic problems. There is un-
likely to be one case where increased
assistance brings about a substantial im-
provement in profits.
No Hay in Stack
HTo have a Holden franchise was once
a simple passport to riches. But
Stack and Co. Ltd, Sydney Holden
dealer, has turned in a substantial loss
of £106,253 for the year to June 30,
1965. There will be no dividend.
During that financial year sales of
Holden cars and station wagons fell 2.6
p.c. while the sales of all makes rose 4.9
p.c. Holden’s share of the market drop-
ped from 41.9 to 38.7 p.c. In the Sep-
tember quarter of 1965, the overall mar-
ket of cars and station wagons dropped
3.1 p.c. on the previous corresponding
period, but Holden’s fall was 14.7 p.c.
and its share of the market was only
35 p.c. (This has occasioned large-scale
sackings from GM-H plants.)
In the preceding June year, Stack
profit was halved to £63,013, represent-
ing 10.7 p.c. on capital. The 15 p.c. divi-
dend paid in the earlier years was trim-
med to 12i p.c. Even this meant raiding
reserves.
Stack blames extremely competitive
trading conditions. Release of a new
model Holden did not save the day in
1964-65, and the new model Pontiacs
and Chevrolets were released too late.
Directors say that the Holden com-
mercial vehicles and the Pontiacs and
Chevrolets were well received, but the
metropolitan vehicle market has con-

tracted. Competition is still severe, so
that trading to the end of October has
been at a loss.
Readers will recall the Trojan horse
move begun in mid-1962 when Peter
Lloyd Industries Ltd bought 517,350 ss.
shares in Stack (36.7 p.c. of capital) from
major shareholders for an average price
of 13s. 2d. Some Stack directors retired
and Peter Lloyd directors filled the
vacancies.
Then, in March, 1963, a takeover
offer was made by Stack under the new
direction for Peter Lloyd. To keep every-
body happy a one-for-five bonus was dis-
tributed to Stack shareholders, old and
new.
The whole campaign was justified on
the grounds that integration would give
a broader basis of participation in the
automobile industry and would enable
economies to be effected. Mr C. J.
Stevens (chairman) said the board was
confident of maintaining a dividend of
“at least 15 p.c. on the augmented capi-
tal” of Stack, inclusive of the exchange
for Peter Lloyd and the bonus.
Stack ss. shares are now bringing less
than half their par value. Shareholders
have a right to ask where are the benefits
of higher profits, steady dividends and
greater security promised such a short
time ago.
The motor-vehicle industry is essen-
tially cyclical, and dealers have had, ere
this, to ride out worse market conditions
than those prevailing at present.
Another Holden dealer, W. T. Cog-
gins Holdings Ltd (with franchises also
for Bedford and Vauxhall), which ex-
perienced a 37 p.c. profit fall in its June
year (still 34.4 p.c. on capital), traded
profitably in the first quarter of the
current year. But the chairman warned
that 1965-66 profits could be lower than
last year’s.
Undue Confusion
shareholders may be surprised
to see the diversified Henry Berry
group omitting final dividend after a 53
p.c. profit jump in the latest year, the
simple fact is that had directors omitted
the final in 1963-64 the present confusion
would never have arisen. Instead they
distributed a final 4 p.c., making the
year’s full payout of 9 p.c. uncovered by
the 5.6 p.c. earnings. Earning rate for
the latest year is 8.5 p.c., but the only
payout will be the interim 5 p.c.
This policy is the complete opposite
of that adopted in 1963-64, as the board
is feeling the need to conserve working
capital. Of course, directors do not men-
tion the fact that it is usually a sound
idea to make sure that dividends are
always covered by earnings. One can

Here’s what we’re up against:
Maybe the competitor’s copier has been there for six months or a year.
It’s practically a fixture. And dislodging a fixture is no cinch.
Until we prove that our copier makes copies twice as fast; often at
half the cost.
This is what we do when we demonstrate our Bruning 2000 to business-
men living with our competitor’s copier.
These men know their copying requirements. They know the quantities
and the sizes of copies they need. They have found out all the costs of
copying, including some hidden ones. They’ve learned the economy of speed.
So when they see how the Bruning 2000 delivers perfect copies for as little
as 3.5 pence per copy (including materials and depreciation for volume
purchasers), we’re almost in.
When they see that they can copy documents from cheque size to 11 inches

imagine that this has something to do
with it too.
Fortunately, it should not be very
difficult to cover a 9 p.c. payout in the
current year. Through its interests, in
confectionery, food machinery, plastics
and electronics, turnover was up 12i
p.c. in the first three months. The two
major subsidiaries will soon be seeing
the benefits of certain installations, de-
signed to boost production among other
things. In 1964-65 the profits of these
two were considerably reduced by pro-
duction disruptions arising from the new
installations.
Touche!
A ny one of thousands of customers
** who have had credit dealings with
Melbourne’s giant Myer group would
have chuckled quietly to themselves at
the annual meeting. A shareholder ques-
tioned the finance director on the bad
debts of nearly £1,500,000 in 1964-65.
As those who have experienced Myer’s
credit-control system will tell, such a
figure can only be scoffed at and Mr
Gregory was quick to point out its fal-
lacy.
He said the shareholder was referring
to provision for doubtful debts, shown
in the accounts at around £1,400,000.
This was a substantially different item
from bad debts, which he felt would not
even reach £500,000 —an extremely
low figure in relation to turnover and
one which reflects most favorably on
the credit system. Making the most of
his opportunity to speak on the bad debts
problem of so many retailers, Mr Greg-
ory pointed out that the large provision
ensured that the group would not be
caught “like some other companies’’
which had announced profits only to find
later that none had been earned. Touche!

net a mere £22,000 from farm and
station supplies, foam plastics, plastic
bottles, mouldings and extrusions, poly,
styrene processing, bulk-handling equip,
ment, materials handling and conveying
systems.
It seems hard to imagine suitable em-
ployment of about £5 million in the
existing business interests, so, while Wil-
liams holds the ACI shares, it should be
viewed more as an investment than a
manufacturing and merchandising com-
pany.
Receipt of 10 p.c. dividends on its
ACI investment would add only about
£25,000 to Williams’ profits, putting it
up in the 20 p.c. earning rate class. As
the company has a reservoir of liquid
funds in ACI shares, it could afford to
dispense dividends of 15 p.c. to share-
holders (1964, 10£ p.c.).
Shareholders are being asked to ratify
the ACI deal at an extraordinary meet-
ing. This should be the occasion for
some explanation of directors’ intentions,
seeing that the net tangible asset back-
ing of their shares (calculated on the
market value of ACI shares) has ap-
preciated so vastly, without much im-
provement in apparent earnings capacity.
From ACl’s viewpoint the deal re-
inforces an association with St Regis

world's largest paper companies, with in-
terests in timber, plastics, building
materials and packaging.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Facing a Fierce Competitor
Queensland’s beer and Castlemaine Perkins
Only two of the six Australian States
have a choice of brewers. Victoria,
Tasmania, South Australia and Western
Australia are each served by one brew-
ing company except that there is a
small brewery in South Australia in
addition to the South Australian Brew-
ing Company. In Queensland, Castle-
maine Perkins Limited has to face the
mighty Carlton and United Breweries as
a competitor, for CUB acquired Queens-
land Brewery early in 1961. Castle-
maine's bid of 10s. a share was
unsuccessful.
For some reason, the market still
seems to expect that Castlemaine
Perkins will receive a takeover offer
from either CUB or some other Aus-
tralian or overseas brewing company. The
logic of this expectation is rather difficult
to follow, apart from the fact that the
last takeover of a listed brewing company
occurred in Queensland. On the basis of
the demand for beer, the per capita
consumption of beer in Queensland has
been consistently below the per capita
consumption of Australia as a whole
and, while I have not checked on the
recent trends, it seems that there was a
declining trend in Queensland’s per
capita consumption from 1957 to 1962.
In Victoria, this trend was upwards and
in New South Wales it was virtually
steady, so these two markets would
be more attractive on the face of it.
Victoria has an added attraction for the
new entrant into the industry in that
it has a relatively high proportion of
‘"free” hotels. This feature could have
been the major factor in Charrington's
thinking when it made an abortive
attempt to enter the Australian market.
It might, perhaps, be thought that
Queensland is attractive because the
profits are higher. There is always the
possibility that the Queenslanders could
be persuaded that their market is not
yet saturated and they should drink a
few more gallons per head per annum
to achieve this very desirable condition.
Taking the latter point first, it is only
fair to say that the per capita demand
for beer seems to be fairly inelastic
throughout the world. It changes very
slowly and even when the price is
increased by “vicious” taxation or by
greedy” beer barons, consumption is
°nly affected for a short period fre-
quently less than three months. On the
first factor there is some justification,
for the wholesale price of beer to the
brewer after deducting excise duty is
higher in Queensland than all the other
Australian States except Western Aus-
tralia. Since the last Budget this price
has been as follows:
per kilderkin
(eighteen gallons
approximately)
New South Wales £2 9 0\
Victoria £2 12 101
South Australia £2 18 4^
Tasmania £3 1 7|
Queensland £3 5 6J
Western Australia £3 19 1^
In addition to the increase in excise
duty, the brewers’ price was increased in
most States. In Victoria and Queensland
this increase was very small —id. per
18 gallons on draught beer and no
increase on bottled and canned beer. The
largest increase was made in South
Australia and amounted to 4s. 9id. per
18 gallons on draught beer and 6s. per
18 gallons on bottled beer. New South
Wales increased prices by Is. s!d. on
draught and 3s. on bottled. So far as
these two States are concerned, these
increases were the first since March,
1960, whereas the other States had had
increases prior to the Budget. In par-
ticular, Queensland had an increase of
3s. 3d. per 18 gallons in February of
this year.
Tt is fairly easy to make out some esti-
mate of the direct result of a price
increase on a brewer’s profits in the short
term. After all, it seems reasonable that,
if the price goes up by twopence a
gallon and the brewer sells 17.5 million
gallons, revenue will increase by just
over £145,000. The problem is to assess
the effect on the brewer's return from
its hotel rentals; in all cases this becomes
an impossible task because we do not
know the split-up of gross revenues
between beer production and net rents.
In the case of Castlemaine Perkins,
the figure for “profit from trading and
income from hotels'' has progressed as
follows over the last four years (the
figure was not available prior to 1962):
Year to July 31 1962 1963 1964 1965
(£'000)
Disclosed 1613 1866 2152 2501
Index 1962=100 100 115 133 155
These figures suggest an annual rate
of increase of 15 p.c. compound rising
to 16 p.c. in 1965, probably as a result
of the price increase in February. There
can be no doubt that this rate of increase
is remarkably good when it is con-
sidered that the total market is probably
expanding at a rate of about 4 p.c. It
seems clear that either Castlemaine Per-
kins has been increasing its share of the
total market (as many Queenslanders
suggest) or that expenses have been well
contained. It seems from the chairman's
addresses of recent years that strong
attempts have been made to improve
efficiency by firstly concentrating brew-
ing activities at Milton and then by
extending and modernising that particu-
lar brewery. It is also apparent that
the company has been actively tackling
the problem of increasing sales by
obtaining more outlets and renovating
and improving its existing outlets.
During this particular period, the
only benefits to shareholders have taken
the form of increases in the dividend
rate, which has been raised from 14
to 17 p.c., but it is only fair to say
that the dividend payout has more or
less kept pace with the adjusted earn-
ings. A comparison of the following
indices is enlightening, for it shows that
the price of the company’s shares has
far outstripped earnings and dividend
increases:
1962 = 100
1962 1963 1964 1965
Adjusted earnings 100 110 119 139
Dividends 100 100 114 121
Share price 100 139 181 166
There can be no doubt that Castle-
maine Perkins has had an excellent
record, even though it has been faced
with competition from Carlton and
United; this competition has been and
will continue to be fierce. Whether the
present price of 60s. to yield only 2.8 p.c.
is justified is a question that can be better
answered when the other brewery com-
panies have been examined and a com-
parison made.

W. R. Carpenter’s Amazing Growth
Shareholders can expect early further benefits
By ROGER RANDERSON
the eve of the annual general meet-
ing to be held Canberra next
Friday it is timely ' to examine the
accounts of W. R. Carpenter (Holdings)
Ltd for the 1964-65 year ended last
June, which shareholders will then be
asked to approve.
As one stretches out after poring over
the figures, a story (which can only be
apocryphal) comes irresistibly to mind.
One day an outside director found Mr
R. B. Carpenter (the company’s able
chairman) looking extremely worried.
“What’s the matter?" said the outside
director.
Mr Carpenter replied: “I’m blessed if
I can find anything else to write off.
Can you suggest anything more?"
After some moments of concentrated
thought the other director said: “Well,
there is still our two-and-a-half million
of cash. We haven’t raised a provision
against the loss of that yet"
This is the key to understanding why
W. R. Carpenter could make a one-for-
four bonus issue in 1964 followed by a
one-for-five early this year and still show
an earning rate of 35.8 p.c. on average
capital.
The fact that the company does not
include £8,593,478 “unmatured rentals
on signs and lighting contracts” in its
balance sheet is equivalent to regarding
it as having raised provisions of the
same amount against this extremely
valuable asset and source of future earn-
ings. I have, therefore, taken the liberty
Of presenting the item in this more
realistic way in the accompanying table.
Many reasons are assigned for the fact
that the company’s ss. stock unit has
fallen from this year’s high point of
38s. 6d. (cum rights) to the present price
of about 255., still far below the theoreti-
cal ex-rights price.
It is true that the 3 p.c. dividend
yield is not exciting at the moment, but
“yield-consciousness” during a tempor-
ary period of abnormally high interest
rates can be carried too far, and should
not cause the longer-term significance
of a 7.1 p.c. earnings yield to be over-
looked.
Indeed, readers need not look beyond
W. R. Carpenter if they require a “blue
chip” with early prospects, which is
certain to rise in price as liquidity im-
proves from the strengthening of the
nation’s external balance.
The two recent bonus issues may be
thought to have reduced the company’s
capacity to increase dividend payments
for the time being, consistently with
maintaining an earning rate of more
than 35 p.c., a result that has regularly
been achieved for each of the past six
years, although this need not be an in-
exorable target.
My own impression, however, is that
directors have been less generous to
shareholders than they could have been
considering the accumulation of pro-
visions and reserves since 1957-58 (when
formation of the holding company virtu-
- ally provided a one-for-one bonus issue),
the fact that shareholders were called
upon to contribute £2,667,267 in the
one-for-four cash issue at 12s. 6d. in
1962- and the effect of bringing
. balance-date back from September to
June.
Increases Increases In
In Profit Dividend Payout
1962 63 -4- £316,841 + £126,999
1963- 4- £369,584 £242,518
1964 65 + £232,125 + £ 62,500
+ £918,550 + £432,017
Tt is true that the company faces an
A increase of £187,500 in the amount of
dividends to be paid out on existing
capital in the current year, but it will be
surprising if profits do not increase by
much more than this. Nor would a
bonus issue made at the end of March,
and ranking for its first dividend in
November, 1966, raise any problem for
the current year.
Will Mr Carpenter, with experience
of almost half the current year to guide
him, be able to take a confident view of
profits in 1965-66, so that he can an-
nounce a further bonus issue next
Friday? Or will he announce plans for
conquering new fields, coupled with a
cash issue?
He would need strong premonitions
of a slump in presently booming trade in
the islands, with high copra prices and
rising living standards of the natives, and
of a marked recession at home (which I
would immediately reject), for declining
to announce such further, already due,
benefits for shareholders.
Indeed, the accounts seem to indicate
that W. R. Carpenter has made prepara-
tion for emulating Burns Philp, its older
but less profitable rival, with its recent
succession of bonus issues.
Reserves already available for capital-
isation total £2,797,331, in ratio of one
to 2.7 of existing capital of £7,500,000,
which is still £1,500,000 below that of
Burris Philp. These reserves include
£665,688 in share premiums account left
over from the 1963 cash issue and
£2,047,767 of revaluation reserves left
over after the recent bonus issue.
W. R. Carpenter was less vulnerable
than Burns Philp to paper losses on its
investments during the past year, partly
because a smaller proportion is involved
in insurance and because of a smaller
top-hamper of market valuation.
Income from investments actually in-
creased by £62,969 to £594,397 in the
year ended last June. It will increase
in the current year, as the company has
taken up its rights in recent cash issues
by Ansett (260,000) and CAGA
(672,000). Investment income will in-
crease even more in 1965-66, if the com-
pany takes up its 1,450,000 rights in the
current Woolworths issue.
Some investments were sold in 1964-
65, £104,900 was written off others, and
almost £265,000 was switched into
bonds. Book value of all investments was
£140,433 lower at £9,744,419 on June
30. Although market value of the port-
folio had declined by £2,397,875 from
the 1964 peak, it was still £1,456,366
in excess of book value.
Substantial recovery in market value
of investments can reasonably be ex-
pected in the coming year.
Flourishing activities in the Pacific
Islands are reflected in last year’s ac-
counts. With “substantial improvement”
in merchandise turnover, stocks and
debtors have increased.
Further progress with the £1 million
programme of tea-planting in the Wahgi
Valley of New Guinea, with ultimate con-
struction of three large factories in the
area, can be expected in the current
year, although “capital commitments”
were given as only £312,214 on June 30.
The group’s most distinguishing differ-
ence from Burns Philp is that it runs a
nation-wide business, manufacturing and
leasing illuminated signs, fluorescent
lighting and plastic signs.
During 1964-65 the cost of net addi-
tions to signs and lighting installed on
location was £714,599 an increase of
£72,776 from the previous year.
An increase of £7701 occurred in
rentals received in advance and there
was an addition during the year of
£373,959 to rentals receivable, after they

bad been drawn upon to provide the
year’s contribution to profits.
Provision for depreciation and amor-
tisation of signs and lighting, however,
totalled £695,828 before determining
profit from this activity in 1964-65.
The effect was to reduce the net value
in the books of signs and lighting on
location (after provisions including the
59th and 60th instalments received in
advance) by £7,394 to £1,453,062, which
is only about a third of the cost of signs
and lighting installed.
Moreover, the net valuation figure has
been reduced to almost one-sixth of the
£8,593,478 rentals now receivable.
Technically, the directors may be cor-
rect. Conceivably, all customers could
relinquish their leases when their five-
year periods expire. Conceivably, too,
the nation could be plunged into war in-
volving a nation-wide black-out.
But what are the probabilities, as dis-
tinct from such extreme contingencies?
The record of contracts renewed since
1962 discounts the first contingency.
Valued (after amortisation) at £1,790,090
in 1962, subsequent relinquishments have
totalled only £78,843 in three years.
Directors, however, have already written
their net value down to less than
£294,509.
As to the second contingency of Aus-
tralia’s conceivable involvement in total
and permanent war, one is surprised to
find market pessimists singling out
W. R. Carpenter with other so-called
“island traders”, when few industries
would be immune and this company has
provided against the contingency on a
tremendous scale.
Tracing accounts through, I find the
following surprising figures for the period
of the past three years:

Doubters should look at the remark-
able rise to 9.6 p.c. in stated profits as
a proportion of shareholders’ funds
a figure which is understated because of
calculation on funds at the end of the
year, and because of recent revaluations.
Shareholders cannot fail to benefit
and soon from a company that over
many years has provided so handsomely
for emergencies and regularly ploughs
back far more of its stated earnings than
it pays out in dividends.
W. R. Carpenter was in 1963, as I
stated, one of my favorite stocks for
growth with stability. It is even more so
now, at much reduced prices.

LANRAY INDUSTRIES LIMITED
231 MACQUARIE STREET ------- SYDNEY
ADDRESS OF THE CHAIRMAN
to the Annual General Meeting held on
29th October, 1965
29th October, 1965
With your permission I suggest that we take the
Reports and Financial Statements contained therein
as read. Before moving their adoption I would like to
say what a very pleasant year was 1964-1965 for all
associated with the Company. Our personnel de-
rived great satisfaction from the success which they
achieved in implementing our plans. I know that our
Shareholders are happy with the improved results
and to see that the Company is moving forward to
progressively better things.
The Annual Report for 1965 was the most com-
prehensive we have published to date. Year Direc-
tors have endeavoured to give you a full and clear
picture of our current and forward position. There
is little which I can add other than to say that all
our business activities are moving in accordance
with our plans. We expect to have another very
satisfactory year.
Seven financial years have elapsed since the re-
construction of the Company in May, 1958 when,
with its funds and capital lost due to previous un-
profitable manufacturing activities, the Company
emerged from Receivership and came under the
existing managerial and financial direction. It has
been my privilege to be intimately associated with
the Company during that period and the most satis-
fying thing about the association is that our Register
of Members has read almost like a list of friends.
Many of our present Members have held their
shares and increased their holdings progressively
throughout these years.
It is sometimes instructive to look back as well as
to plan forward and seven years is a good long
period to survey. If one looks only at annual profits
or measures progress year by year, it is difficult to
recognise a pattern. Recently we surveyed our
results over these seven years and I know that our

EARNED IN 7 YEARS £821,836
Members will be gratified, as were the Directors, to
learn that the global totals show that the Company
has paid out £172,371 in dividends and built up
retained net shareholders' funds after tax by
£708,497 in exchange for the net capital investment
made by our Members since 1958 of only £59,032.
We believe that this convincingly proves that we
have been consistent and have followed a stable
policy. The figures are shown in the previous
column.
These figures do not include any intangible assets
such as the goodwill we paid in 1961 for the Pen-
prase companies and wrote off or the surplus of the
value of our present investment in New Caledonia.
If these were taken into account they would add
another £67,000 to the surplus mentioned above.
At times the Board has been disturbed by innu-
endoes or suggestions that Lanray has no stable
investment policy and that it has been merely an
opportunist or speculator with more than the average
run of good luck. This is quite untrue. While we have
found ourselves in some fortunate situations it has
always been as a result of foresight and timing. We
have never accepted that there is any particular
virtue in following traditional patterns of business
activity simply because they are traditional. Instead,
we have sought out and developed dynamic situ-
ations capable of producing a high reward but only
after fully assessing the risks and satisfying our-
selves that the benefit of any doubt would be, with
constant attention to detail, in our favour. In the
seven years our subsidiaries have indeed invested
in a number of diverse rctivities land develop-
ment, supplier of building materials since 1959, city
property development, brandy distilling, share in-
vestment and more recently foreign investment, as
a basis to create an integrated tourist resort in New
Caledonia. Apart from a successful record as a sup-
plier of building materials, we have not built up a
history in any particular industry and, in fact, we
have been unable to find in Australia any other
industry to which our small Company could gain
access in such a way as to assure continuing profits.
Nevertheless, although our pattern of activities has
not been traditional, the above figures prove that it
has been extremely profitable.
On behalf of the Board I would like to express our
appreciation for the faith, confidence and support
given by our large and small shareholders during
these years. These have made it possible for the
Board to initiate and carry through with confidence
the activities which have produced these tangible
rewards.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Queensland Can Can
It even moves southwards
The packaging specialists, Queensland
Can Co. Ltd, plan a £lim. expansion
programme, financed by a one-for-ten
par issue early in 1966, by retained
profits and depreciation provisions, by
the sale of surplus assets, and perhaps by
additional short-term funds.
The company boasts that it provides
industry with packages and containers of
paper, cardboard, tinplate, plastic, cellu-
lose, polythene and laminates.
The tinplate section was begun in
Brisbane in 1921. The plant at West End
is limited in area, so in 1962 a factory
was established on a 48-acre site at
Rocklea where open-top cans, crown
seals and drums, and beer and beverage
cans are made. General line cans are
made at West End, but the first stage of
the expansion plan is to consolidate tin-
plate activities at Rocklea and then to
construct an administrative block there.
In 1936 Queensland Can began the
printing of paper labels for cans at West
End and later the production of card-
board cartons. In 1946 a small plant
was purchased at Moorooka, where
corrugated and solid fibreboard con-
tainers are made. Directors describe the
growth of the paper products division
since 1950 as spectacular, for the
division now occupies 140,000 square
feet of factory space. This division will
also be moved to a new building at
Rocklea, according to the present ex-
pansion programme.
In the mid-'fifties a flexible packaging
plant was set up at West End for cellu-
lose and poythene film bags and wraps.
This was moved to Yeerongpilly in 1959;
extra land adjoining the factory has been
purchased for expansion.
Northern Manufactures Pty, of Towns-
ville, was acquired in 1956. This plant
makes cans, crown seals, corrugated and
solid fibre cartons, cellulose and poly-
thene bags and wraps, tinplate drums
and pails for North Queensland.
Corrugated and solid fibreboard con-
tainers and cellulose and polythene film
bags and wraps are made at Rock-
hampton by Central Queensland Pack-
age Manufacturers Pty, a subsidiary
formed in 1964.
Cardboard Can and Tube Pty was
bought out in 1962. Operations of this
Brisbane firm have been extended to in-
clude plastic bottles and injection mould-
ings. Extra factory space is being made
available at New Farm. A new factory is
under construction in the fruit growing
district of Mildura (Vic.).
The first real breakaway from packag-
ing was the 1962 purchase of Howards
Ltd, which distributes BMC vehicles in
Brisbane and Toowoomba, and Stude-
baker vehicles and parts and accessories
for both firms throughout Queensland.
Moreover, Howards has extensive invest-
ments and valuable freeholds.
Southern domination of Queensland
industry is very widespread, so that there
was great rejoicing when Queensland
showed that it can can and also knows
how where takeovers are concerned, for
the company made a successful offer to
the Melbourne firm, Paper and Board
Industries Ltd.
This organisation had large factories
in Melbourne, Perth and Berri (SA),
making corrugated and solid fibre con-
tainers in three States, and building
papers as well in Melbourne.
Apart from share issues to acquire
Paper and Board Industries, Howards
and Yeastrel Food Supply Pty (in 1962),
the company had two one-for-one par
issues in 1951 and 1952, a one-for-five
par issue in September, 1960, and a one-
for-five bonus in December, 1961.
The Queenslander has a continuous
record of profits and dividends of at least
81 p.c. since 1928, if not earlier.
Profit has multiplied from £143,000 in
1959-60 to £455,000 five years later,

shares in December, 1960), with The
Metal Box Co. Ltd of England, and the

The company follows a policy of
planned development and plant modern-

techniques which enabled the company
to minimise price increases during
1964-65.
Shareholders should be very satisfied
with their investment. They can look

so far this year has been between 10s. Id,

A Reputation for Issues
Good, sensible Johns Hydraulics
nPHKOUGH its operating subsidiary, Mel-
A bourne-based Johns Hydraulics Ltd
spreads its interests through the hydraulic
equipment field, electrical accessories and
pantograph diesinking. The group came
into being in 1951. Since that period it
has established itself as a generous issuer
of shares and a steady dividend payer.
Following a record 1964-65, the com-
pany is heading toward further peaks and
shareholders can look forward to in-
creased prosperity over the next few
years.
The hydraulic equipment division is
the largest supplier of plastics moulding
machinery in Australia and New Zealand.
Some equipment is built under licence
from overseas. A UK company makes
Johns machines under licence for the
British marke*. The machines can be sold
on any market and there are units cur-
rently operating in South Africa, Mexico,
Puerto Rico, UK and the USA.
This division also makes diecasting
machines under a US licence and the
range it provides to the Australian and
New Zealand industry is the widest avail-
able. All-hydraulic metal-working presses
are another product, also made under US
licence. In addition to these licences, the
company also acts as a straight agent for
certain overseas products and, in turn, it
has agents abroad handling its own manu-
factures.
The electrical division is one of the
leading makers of accessories in Austra-
lia. The range covers bakelite items for
the wiring of homes, office blocks, etc.
A range of metal plates for switches and
power points has recently been intro-
duced.
The pantograph-diesinking services
cover dies for the plastics, diecasting,
rubber and metal-working industries. In
conjunction with this division, the
hydraulics division offers a package deal
in the supply of equipment machine
and tooling.
To simplify operations and improve
efficiency, these three divisions, once
subsidiaries, have been amalgamated
since June 30 last. The group's head
office and works are at Clayton and
there are offices in NSW, Queensland
and SA. Agents operate in Tasmania and
WA. In addition there are overseas
associates and agents in the US, the UK,
Europe, NZ, South Africa, Mexico,
Central and South America.
The group’s latest year was its best
ever. Profit at £1 13,000 gave an all-time
record earning rate of 21 p.c. and divid-
end was 10 p.c. for the seventh year. A
£lOO,OOO note conversion did not rank
for dividends, but even including this
figure in the ranking capital (as has
been done in the accompanying table)
earning rate would still be 17.7 p.c.
The reputation for issues has arisen
from a pattern of par moves established
soon after formation. There were issues
in 1951-52, 1953-54 and 1955-56, or
every two years. Then came a gap to
the one-for-four issue of 1960-61 and the
one-for-five of 1962-63, continuing the
two-year pattern. The lack of an issue
this year is explained by the note con-
version; the gap between 1955-56 and


Company Meeting:
COMENG HOLDINGS LIMITED
Extracts from the speech delivered by the chairman of Comeng
Holdings Limited, Mr. F. P. Donohoe, at the annual general meeting of
stockholders held in Sydney, November 9, 1965.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This is the first occasion upon which I
have had the privilege of addressing you as
chairman of your company.
My appointment was made after the
death of our late chairman, Mr E. H.
Pratten, on June 25 last and I would like
to commence my remarks today by making
a public acknowledgement of the contribu-
tion made by Mr E. H. Pratten, in his
capacity as a director since 1946 and as
chairman for the past two years, to the
successful development of your company.
Mr Pratten was held in the highest esteem
by his colleagues on this board of directors
and I take this opportunity to express our
regret at his passing.
The balance sheet as at June 30, 1965,
and the profit and loss account for the year
ended on that date, together with reports
thereon from the directors and auditors,
were forwarded to you with the notice con-
vening this meeting. Consequently, I pre-
sume I have your approval to take them
as read.
Consolidated profit for the year available
to Comeng Holdings Limited (after pro-
viding for the interests of the outside share-
holders in three of the group’s subsidiaries)
has risen by 29.4 per cent from £304,837 to
£394,482 and the ratio of these earnings
to the issued capital of the company at
June 30 has increased from 18 per cent
to 23.3 per cent. These results are after
deducting a net capital loss of £6,559, result-
ing from the sale of fixed assets.
The report of the directors explains the
significant movements disclosed in the ac-
counts. However, there is one aspect of the
company’s financial affairs as at June 30,
1965, to which I would like to make further
reference.
The parent company’s balance sheet
traditionally lists shares in subsidiary com-
panies—at cost. In accordance with normal
practice your board has made no formal
move to revalue these assets and has relied
upon the consolidated earning rate to reflect
any appreciation in value in this item.
PURCHASE OF SUBSIDIARY
However, stockholders will be interested
to learn that two prominent South African
public companies have recently purchased
a 20 per cent interest in our South African
subsidiary and this transaction establishes
an independent market value for this im-
portant overseas investment of Comeng and
I believe that 1 should advise you that if
the South African investment valued at
this established market price was to be added
to the net Australasian tangible assets at
audited book value, then the tangible asset
backing of the shares of Comeng Holdings
Limited would be substantially in excess of
the figure revealed by the consolidated
accounts.
The purpose of this remark is to draw
the attention of stockholders to the result
which follows if one vikws the net assets
of the Australasian undertaking in the
normal manner; that is, at audited book
value only and regards the South African
undertaking as an investment at its present
established market price.
I now propose to briefly review our activi-
ties in Australasia and South Africa.
AUSTRALASIA: A number of significant
contracts were processed during the year
under review and I have listed some of the
more noteworthy projects below:
• Louvred vans for the transport of
perishable goods on the Queensland
Railways.
• High-sided open waggons also for the
Queensland Railways.
• Assembly of Clyde-G.M. diesel electric
Mainline locomotives for use on the
Queensland and Western Australian
Railway systems.
• Steelwork for the new K. 57 shaft for
Mt Isa Mines Ltd.
• The first liquid petroleum gas rail tank
cars for use in Australia.
• Modern passenger coaches for the
transcontinental service of Common-
wealth Railways.
• Coal hopper waggons for B.H.P.
• Hot metal cars of the type depicted
on the cover of this year’s annual
report.
• The entire facade and /or the
aluminium and glass curtain walling
of such buildings as Pearl Assurance
and Reserve Bank in Sydney and the
new Commonwealth Centre in Mel-
bourne.
• Components for commercial and
Army vehicles.
• Power car shells for the Victorian
Railways.
The demand for railway rolling stock has
continued during the past 12 months, but
competition from local and overseas sup-
pliers remains keen.
IMPORT COMPETITION
There have been several instances of the
importation of railway waggons from Japan
at what appear to be sub-economic prices.
In an endeavor to obtain protection against
sub-economic prices, the company has
registered with the Department of Customs
and Excise its protest that these importa-
tions, at apparently sub-economic levels,
should occur whilst local manufacturers stilt
have excess capacity available at normally
competitive prices.
The operating companies have had con-
siderable success during the year in the
general engineering field, in addition to the
more traditional products of railway rolling
stock, and encouraged by this success they
are making every endeavor to continue
diversification in this direction.
In order to keep abreast of the latest
developments in this general engineering
field we have installed, or we have on order,
substantial additional equipment for use at
the Granville, Rocklea and Dandenong
plants. /
Overall, the Australasian companies have
operated at a slightly increased rate of
activity during the year, by comparison
with the previous year, and they have on
hand a satisfactory forward order book of
work for future execution.
SOUTH AFRICA: Union Carriage and
Wagon Co. (Pty.) Limited, the company’s
South African . subsidiary, has again
delivered substantial quantities of railway
rolling stock on order for the South African
Railways and industrial locomotives for
local industry. Deliveries to the South
African Railways were:
• 96 2,500 h.p. Mainline electric loco*
motives; and
• 172 passenger coaches.
Once again, periodic visits were made to
the Nigel Plant during the year by directors
and executives of your company to permit
of constant review of the operations of tljaf
subsidiary and also for the purpose of pro-
viding essential commercial and technical
assistance.
Since June 30, 1965, further substantial
orders have been received from the South
African Railways and orders held by out 1
subsidiary for future execution are now at
a record level.
The efficiency of the operations at Nigel
and the very substantial throughput in-
volved has enabled Union Carriage and
Wagon Co. (Pty.) Limited to continue to
quote very keen prices, with the result that
the company has maintained its successful
record of accepted tenders with the South
African Railways. Output increased for the
1964-65 year and profits also showed a sub-
stantial improvement.
As mentioned in the report of the direc-
tors, leading South African public com-
panies have acquired the 40.8 per cent
interest in Union, formerly held by non-
residents, thus bringing the South African
residential interest in Union to approxi-
mately 48 per cent.
Comeng was pleased to encourage this
increase in local participation in the com-
pany, particularly in view of the support
received from the South African Railways
and the encouragement which at all times
has been afforded Union Carriage and
Wagon Co. (Pty.) Limited by the South
African Administration.
DIVIDEND POLICY
I would now like to amplify the board’s
recent remarks on dividend policy. Experi-
ence since incorporation has convinced us
that Comeng Holdings Limited may be fairly
regarded as a safe investment to return a
10 per cent dividend.
However, because of the inevitable cycle
of fluctuating demand in the heavy engineer-
ing and relatively long-term contracting field
the amount of profits considered appropriate
for distribution may from time to time
vary and may exceed this rate of dividend
in good years, or may only equal same in
years of lower activity.
For this reason, the board has, on more
than one occasion, indicated that it will
continue its practice of recommending
bonus dividends whenever the results for
any year appear to justify same and that
fluctuation in dividend rate above 10 per
cent will be related to the results of the
particular period under review.
Your directors feel it desirable to again
emphasise this point, and in so doing, I
would point out that trends since the issue
of the preliminary report in September
appear to justify the optimism expressed by

1960-61 was a result of a rather diffi-
cult period the group went through, now
past and forgotten. In one year of that
period a small loss was incurred and
dividend was omitted for the first and
still only time.
The current year should see further
improving trends. At the annual meeting
shareholders were told sales to date had
been slightly higher. Orders on hand
were satisfactory. The amalgamation of
the three divisions should be making
itself felt on efficiency. Increased returns
are expected from the electrical division
following the installation of new equip-
ment at the factory. To further concen-
trate administrative effort, the Auckland
branch was closed and a local company
now makes electrical accessories under
licence.
Factory extensions undertaken in the
latter half of 1964-65 have now been
completed. In addit on. nine acres of
land adjoining the Clayton factory have
been purchased for future expansion.
The accompanying table shows an
overall rise in current assets, an overall
fall in current liabilities, wbh the result
that working capital is the best it has
been for some time. Fixed assets have
hardly moved and 'he recent plans
illustrate that the group had reached
capacity, ln angibl.s are low and being
reduced every year. l oan capital variei
a lot and is currently at a very sensible
level. Reserves show slow growth, mainly
because the continual issuing of shares
keeps a hcavv hand on undistributed pro-
fits. Nevertheless. they are quite
encouraging considering this poliev.
To sum up currently selling around
15s. and yielding an attractive 6] p.c.
from the dividend after brokerage, the
shares appear good, sensible buying. An
issue is well on the cards in the current
year or in 1966-67.' The group is
financially sound and has a bright future.
The next note conversions arc not until
1972 and 1975. so the group will be ir
the position to continue i s issue policy,
until then.

SPECULATORS DIARY
An Error of Judgment
Confessed, as is customary
OVER the years I’ve made some dreadful mistakes. Fortunately I’ve admitted them
(in other words, sold) and the overall result has not been too bad. My latest
error of judgment was in expecting a higher price for Consolidated Rutile preference
shares.
I fully expected these shares to come
on at par, at which price they would
offer an 8 p.c. tax-free yield. Instead, the
opening price was Is. 6d. below the par
value of 10s. On the other hand, the
ordinary shares came on 2s. above their
par value!
While the market price of the securi-
ties in Consolidated Rutile has me baffled,
I do feel confident about making one
prediction on a matter connected with
the stock market. I refer to the coming
annual meeting of Kolotex. It is my
belief that a certain gentleman attending
that meeting will rise at the end of
“general business” and ask that the
appreciation of all shareholders for the
excellent performance of the company
be recorded in the minutes. To my know-
ledge, he has already made the same
request at the Martin Wells, Pongrass
and Protector Safety meetings. Not that
I’m against congratulating all these com-
panies, but a little bit of variety in these
thanks to the respective companies would
not go astray.
All the companies mentioned in the
previous paragraph have been unusually
successful. As a contrast, Jaywoth
Industries Ltd has been singularly un-
successful. Since commencing business
in 1960, it has notched up the following
losses:
1961 £147,000
1962 £ 97,000
1963 £ 71,000
1964 £ 25,000
The total of these losses exceeds 40
p.c. of the issued capital of £840,000,
which is made up of 360,000 fully paid
shares and 5,000,000 shares paid to 3s.
One would hardly relate such a dismal
record with a letter sent to shareholders
in February, 1961, shortly after the
beginning of operations. In that letter,
directors stated “that the stock market
does not reflect under present conditions
the true value of undertakings”. At that
time, the market value of the share was
just under the paid-up value.
The only section that has really kicked
along was Jaywoth Asphalt Pty Ltd. It
is this part of the business which has
recently been sold to Pioneer Concrete
at a capital profit of £62,000. Because of
this sale, directors are considering a re-
construction in which the liability for
uncalled capital is to be removed on the
contributing shares. The size of the turn-
over in the contributing shares in recent
weeks illustrates the intense interest in
the outcome of the capital reconstruction.
With the contributings selling at Is., I’m
quite prepared to join the throng and
wait in hope for the outcome.
The second and last purchase for the
week was R. W. Miller. Although its
brewery and coal interests are far the
bigger, the coastal shipping side of the
business has attracted much more atten-
tion in the last year. Initially there was an
ultimatum by the Government to have
three tankers built almost immediately in
Australia to augment the fleet of three
coastal tankers imported from abroad.
However, the company has successfully
managed to avoid this move. As a com-
promise, an order for only one tanker
must be placed by April, 1966.
All the controversy that surrounded
the coastal shippers has until now over-
shadowed the remarkable performance
in the 1964-65 year. A 70 p.c. increase
in profits allowed ample room to make
a l-for-5 bonus issue and still maintain
the 10 p.c. dividend rate. The date set
for the bonus issue is November 19. So
my current purchase of 250 shares will
entitle me to 50 bonus shares shortly.
Completing the transactions this week
was the sale of 500 Steamships Trading
at 9s. Bd. Not quite as good a result as I
was hoping for.
Transactions for the week were:
