DURHAM CATHEDRAL’S NORMAN
COLUMNS SEEM TO DEFY
THE AGES
TVURHAM CATHEDRAL is today one
of the noblest examples of architec-
ture in Britain, and for nearly nine
hundred years it has stood upon its rocky
summit high above the River Wear. It
was William the Conqueror who, when
journeying through the north of Eng-
land, realised the natural advantages
of Durham’s location as a fortress
against the northern invaders. He
and his successors encouraged the growth
of a strong self-contained community, and
the Prince Bishops of Durham became
kings of Northumbria, holding consider-
able power and influence.
The building of the existing Cathedral
commenced in 1093, and during the
succeeding four hundred years it grew in
boldness and beauty. Its massive con-
ception is clearly evident in the Nave,
illustrated here, where the huge Norman
pillars are outstanding features of this
magnificent cathedral. They are decorated
with various incised patterns, some
zigzag, some diamond and others in the
transepts are spiral. The lofty central
vault of the Nave was the first example
in the world of such bold suspension of
many tons of solid masonry by the
process of rib-vaulting.
Another noteworthy feature of the
interior is the lovely Chapel of the Nine
Altars where stood, before the year 1540,
the shrine of St. Cuthbert, which was
visited by enormous numbers of
pilgrims. A curious feature on the floor
of the Nave near the north-west door is
a cross in marble which indicated the
nearest point to St. Cuthbert’s resting
place that any woman was allowed to
advance by the monks of Durham.
Visitors to Durham always make a
point of seeing the Galilee Chapel, with
its fine pillars, mural paintings of the
15th century and the Tomb of Venerable
Bede, first English scholar and first
English theologian, who died in 735.
Between the years a.d. 685 and 705 the
gospels were being illuminated at
Lindisfarne, the word “English” was
being coined and set down for the first
time, and Venerable Bede was translating
the Scriptures at Jarrow.

"THE BUNYIP OF BARNEY'S ELBOW"
It would be hard to say which is the
best of the short-stories in Brian
James’s The Bunyip of Barney’s Elbow
(Angus and Robertson), or even to pick
out the most enjoyable.
There is that gentle story of
“Hoffy.” the old fossicker who “found
gold” in the end by growing flowers
and vegetables, enlivened by the hatter
Paddy Griffin, whose life was made
beautiful by his pig:—
Why Paddy kept Daniel at all
must be reckoned a mystery—it was
certainly not for profit or gain, and,
if there had initially been an inten-
tion of eating Daniel, Paddy was,
never able to bring himself to do it.
So Daniel lived on from year to
year, and got bigger and stouter,
and his snout got shorter and shorter
in proportion, and he grew uglier
and uglier and his dugout got dirtier
and dirtier until it was nearly as bad
as Paddy’s own.
There is “The Saintliness of Greg”
—Greg who was always going to “enter
the Church” but fell by the wayside
and the bottle: and into the creek, and
out of Summerlea for ever.
There is “The Triumph of Mrs.
Bolton,” with the fierce monologues in
which Mrs. Bolton triumphs, in
imagination, over the neighbors; and
the row with the schoolmistress when
young Horry Bolton, sausage-eater and
scandalmonger, had been stunned by
Tommy Wenn; and Mrs. Bolton’s
awful accusation that the Doolans had
bugs in the house, which sends Mrs.
Doolan hotfoot to Dawson, the
solicitor:—
“But really, Mrs. Doolan, do you
think anything is to be gained by an
action in the circumstances?”
“It’s me reputation, Mr. Dawson.”
“Quite so, but how much has it
suffered?”
“What! Me who scalds the bed-
steads twice a year at least, and
pours boiling water wid a teapot into
every crack in the floor, verandas and
all!”
“What for?”
“To kill the bugs, of course.”
Mr. Dawson shifted his chair ever
so little, and leaned back farther,
and closed his eyes a bit more. Then
he advised Mrs. Doolan to think it
over, which she earnestly promised
she would do.
There are the bush murder-stories—
each excellent in itself, though follow-
ing too much the same pattern. There
is the pathetic death of young Peter
Wendt, when Charlie felled the tree on
him.
There is that powerful and unusual
story of “The Hagney Affair,” when,
at the climax of a long feud that began
when the solicitor married the priest’s
sister, Mr. Hagney stood up in church
to protest against a pointed reference
to him in the sermon: after which the
church had to be reconsecrated, and
rival presentations were made by the
townspeople to both Father Moran and
Mr. Hagney; and the two, though they
never publicly quarrelled again, and
Mr. Hagney continued to go to church,
never forgave each other.
There is the small boy’s glorious
day of manhood, selling rabbit-skins
and forgetting the shopping for his
mother, in “Pollard”; there is that
wonderful moment in “Mr. Minty’s
Silver Plate” when Mr. Minty accuses
his wife of upsetting his bull. There
is Henry Carr so proud of being able to
announce the death of Queen Victoria
that he gets drunk and falls out of his
sulky and dies himself, as a sort of last
act of homage. There are the very
human passengers, some comic, some
pathetic—and the distillation of the
whole life of the district—“ Coming
Down from Tiptop” in the rattletrap
service-car.
And there is the title-story of the
monster which roared “Yahoo!” at Abe
Newton from under a culvert; a story
teeming with rich country characters
from the publican whose wife had
caressed him with a hammer to the
newspaperman who so unfortunately
falls asleep in the bar when all the
excitement is happening, lovely in its
landscape by sunlight or moonlight,
curious and completely satisfying in its
story, the whole thing brimming with
Australian atmosphere.
“The Triumph of Mrs. Bolton” is
perhaps the funniest of all—she is so
superb an old harridan—with “The
Saintliness of Greg” and “The Reign
of Eugene Ham” (another unmasking
of a hypocrite; memorable for its two
great Bible-bangers of the backwoods)
running it pretty close. But on the
whole, perhaps, because it shows his
power of quiet drama as well as his
comedy—it is no mean feat to make a
bunyip convincing; or almost—because,
complete and rounded from beginning
to end it shows his mastery of the short-
story form, because it demonstrates to
the full his ability to pack the saga of
a whole countryside into a story, and
because the adventure of the bunyip
is so clearly a permanent contribution
to our folklore, I think the best story
is the title-piece..
Certainly one page of it—the intro-
duction, where Brian James is building-
up his setting—will serve to demon-
strate the essential and distinguishing
quality of this book: its richness of
Australian life:—
Barney’s Elbow, without more
exact knowledge, would be sug-
gestive ot a hero, Barney, with an
unconquerable thirst, always giving
exercise to his elbow. And that
rn -,n°ilU? 18 ' i? e a
sharp-angled turn like a bent elbow.
Barney himself had been an inno-
cent, hard-toiling man, the first
settler of Sandy Ridges, and the dis-
coverer of the Elbow. At the foot
of Barney’s was Mick Cullen’s Wild
Cat Hotel. Originally this hostelry
was named The Green Island.
The Green Island had no reference
to any sort of island in the vicinity—
really Barney’s Creek was almost as
lacking in water as in islands, so the
name probably due to the
vdbbnnn ° f ° ne Tirr J oth y B y* ne > a
m den dL P , y P ° lSOn m ' he
f ~ r ~
the creek, but whether he “done it
hisself” or whether it was thoucht-
fully done for him was never
properly discovered. But the fact
that Timothy’s ghost was frequently
seen thereabouts for years after was
strongly suggestive of what is
popularly termed “foul play.”
Mick Cullen was, strictly speaking,
a newcomer, having run the Wild
Cat only for the last twenty-five years
or so. It would again be a mistake
to think that this new name for the
pub had anything to do with mining:
Mick had simply called it after his
first wife. His first inspiration had
been Spitfire—a good name, too, but
connoting words rather than deeds.
Wild Cat suggested both.
Mick was not one to talk over-
much of the past, but in the right
time and mood he could be per-
suaded to expose for view a bony
knob behind his right ear. His
explanation went like a formula:
“She done that. She did. Done it
with a yammer. Just up with the
yammer and cracks me there!”
Mick would pat the bony excrescence
tenderly.
Quite likely there were other marks
of the “yammer” on Mick’s skull,
but they could easily remain hidden
under a very thick growth of dirty-
looking sandy hair. Mick never
seemed to get it cut and it never
seemed to grow any longer than the
shaggy stage. His face was covered
with a similar thicket of hair, of
much the same color. And out of it
looked a pair of dull-green eyes.
Mick wasn’t really handsome.
“She must have been a terror,
Mick.”
Mick turned this over in his mind
and puffed at a briar with a very
broken rim. “Yes, she was that. A
regular wildcat, if you ask me.”
Then, in strict fairness, “But she had
her points—only she was inclined
to go too far.”
Here, in this one page, and merely as
a preliminary to a story in which there
must be twenty other characters, more
fully portrayed, are Barney, Timothy
Byrne, Mick Cullen and his wife, four
people set down in unforgettable
thumbnail-sketches; a suicide, ap
attempted murder; the whole history of
the bush pub; and every word of, it
glowing with humor, as if the prose
had been steeped in sunlight. It is at
once unmistakably Australian writing
and, in its close-packed fertile humor,
ultimately derived—if it didn’t just
happen naturally—from Fielding and
Dickens
r- " u •,, r-
Everywhere with the same fine
q uallties ’ the book as a whole amounts
to , a wonderfully humorous and
authentic picture of an Australian
country town and its surrounding
farms and vineyards. There are a few
gaps in the picture which I wish Brian
James would fill-in—Mr. Friar of the
“Western Argus” is too good to
slumber for ever in one glorious
drunken paragraph; and we do not see
enough of the town—but the general
effect is complete and richly satisfying.
Obviously it goes straight into the tradi-
h It***' *
t a " S ?, n ? nd F«rphy-}akmg.. inct-
dentally, Lawsons wanderers into a
mellowed and fertile country; and
his art, as Norman Lindsay
points out in his foreword, into the
broader development of Maupassant
and Conrad.
It seems fantastic to me to pretend,
as some reviewers have done, that this
great virtue of Brian James’s writing—
his continuation of the Australian out-
back tradition—is somehow a fault. It
is a good tradition; it is fun; it is robust
and authentically Australian; and how-
ever valuable city-stories may be, the
vast land-mass of this continent, still
peopled by characters very much like
Brian James’s, does, beyond the
suburbs of Sydney and five-miles out
from Canberra, continue to exist.
It wouldn’t matter to the stories if
it didn’t: art is art, wherever you find
it; and, going back to the bush-towns
of his boyhood—and thereby setting
down a picture of Australian manners
surely worth preserving—Brian James
has beyond reasonable question found
art of very high quality. I have no
doubt whatever that his stories will
have permanent life in Australian
literature.

Love Poem
Written under Capricorn, a land
Two centuries and half a globe away
From pastoral conventions at their end.
Ihe shepherds and the nymphs have had
their day
And merciless beauty will no longer make
The stuff of formal poems. 3o I take
This plainer speech to say what I must say.
Love breaks upon my cold hills like the
sun.
I cannot fabricate a green email
To set this gift of love, so my heart
Must be stripped bare; I cannot spin a tale
Of goddesses in fabled groves apart
Or fob my passions off on bushland
swains.
Therefore have patience—take my stumb-
ling pains
In this morass of words as love’s report,
And glow upon my cold hills like the sun.
O language fails me in the trembling dark
And I would give my body to you entire
To show a love my poor words cannot
mark
The deeps of. Yet, although consumed by
fire,
I do not give again this shape of flesh
That you already, always, hold in mesh—
And so I build these phrases for love’s
choir.
Love sings upon my cold hills like the sun.
‘ VICTORIA.
And while our leaning poplar-tree turns
bare,
Then green, then bare again above our
heads,
We draw love from ourselves and from
the air
And learn to weave its casual bright
threads
Into a tough and subtle web that can
Outlast our youth and, in our twilight
span,
Be refuge from decay and gathering dreads
While love still warms our cold hills like
the sun.
One thing is now assured; should hemi-
spheres,
As well they may, divide us for a space,
Beyond the last kiss and the parting tears
Your image in my heart will gather grace
And, like 'a stretching spring, my love
will grow
Ever more taut the farther out I go,
Till all my days are haunted by your face.
Love breaks upon my cold hills like the
sun.
Where once was no direction, now there
run
These warm and glowing bars of eastern
light
And love breaks on my cold hills like the
sun.

Apollo Apuleius"
“Classicus”: M. H. Ellis in his article
on Aristotle writes about Apollo
“Apuleius.” I have consulted a dis-
tinguished Doctor of Philosophy and a
professor and they assure me there isn’t
any such character. Will Mr. Ellis
explain who Apollo Apuleius was?
From M. H. Ellis:-
He was a modern god—perhaps 1
should have put his name in inverted
commas. He was born (I should
surmise) on a mid-Victorian com-
memoration-night at Cambridge of
Hebe, Goddess of Youth, by the light
of a fire of vinous inspiration, fed, no
doubt, according to local custom, with
purloined coppers’ helmets. Thus:—
Apollo Apuleius, whom the ancients
called Lyceius,
Had a quarry in a grove, where the
donkeys made their love.
And from there, it came to pass, that
upon his golden ass
Old Aristotle bore philosophic ore
galore
To the Academic shore.
Chorus:
Fill your goblets up with gore
And let us drink—“Hee-haw”
To the fat old Isis wh e.
This ditty was intended as Cam-
bridge’s irreverent comparison of the
manner in which the priests of Isis
restored Lucius the Ass to human shape
with that in which the dons of a certain
reptile contemporary university on the
Isis applied their magic to the
task of transmogrifying the ancient
philosophies.
A Herd of Cowries
While it has not the wide appeal of
her earlier “Australian Shells,” Joyce
Allan’s Cowry Shells of World Seas
(Georgian House) contains much of
rare charm and interest.
There is, for instance, the soothing
hobby of cowry-watching—practised,
says Miss Allan, by her enthusiastic
correspondents such as Mrs. A. R.
Bowman, of Yeppoon, Queensland, and
Mrs. D. Henderson, of Brisbane —as a
result of which you may be rewarded
with the sight of Gratiadusta xanthodon
sitting on her yellow eggs, or even, if
you are exceptionally lucky. Purperosa
facifer similarly brooding above her
dewdrops of living cream.
For the connoisseur of marine
nomenclature, the terms of which, as
Miss Allan has shown before, can so
much enrich the language, there are
such wonderful names as the tiger-
cowry, the serpent’s-head-cowry, the
morning-dawn-cowiy and the “brindled
cowry of the Persian Gulf.” The latter,
incidentally, is a very rare specimen,
and, so ardent in their curious hobby
are the collectors, worth £75; or now,
probably, much more: —
The only specimen Australia ever
boasted was for some years in the
private collection of Dr. J. Cox, a
well-known medical man and
amateur conchologist of Sydney to-
wards the end of the last century.
It was said to have been obtained in
deep water off a reef at Warrior
Reef, Torres Strait. This specimen
was later sold to Fulton in London,
and it was eventually sold in 1917 to
Professor Dautzenberg, the great
conchologist, whose fine collection
of shells was bequeathed to Brussels
Natural History Museum on his
death, in which museum it is at
present.
For the collector of curious informa-
tion in general. Miss Allan records

WHAT IS A WORKER?
APART from “democracy,” probably no word in
the “Labor” politician’s stock-in-trade is so over-
worked as “worker.” Men like Clyde Cameron,
Eddip Ward and Dan Curtin make it work so hard
that they could almost be accused of sweating it.
Yet for a figure so often invoked in Parliamentary
debates and who forms such an important keystone
in the party’s political edifice, the worker himself
is curiously ill-defined; a close study of speeches
in the House and on electioneering platforms gives
a composite picture full of anomalies and
contradictions.
First and foremost, of course, the worker is
a worthy fellow. In fact, he’s the salt of the earth.
He’s the only true Australian, because he’s the
only one who works wholeheartedly for the good
of the country. Everyone eise has an axe to grind
and goes through life ever on the lookout for a
chance to do the worker down. Except, of course,
“Labor” politicians, whose self-appointed task it
is to save the worker from being done-down. Most
Australian of all is the'worker who has qualified
for the old-age pension. This makes him a grand
old pioneer, even if he has never ventured further
from the heart of the city than Harold Park dog-
track. He’s the bloke who helped to make
Australia what it is. More important still, he’s
the bloke who, by his vote, helped to make the
A.L.P. what it is. At times he must wonder if it
was worth while.
The worker of the “Labor” politician’s word-
picture is stronger, more active, more willing and
more intelligent than his opposite-number in any
other country. He has to be, or he wouldn’t be
able to carry the tremendous burden that is heaped
upon him —the back-breaking load of the entire
capitalist system with its crushing interest-bills, its
excess profits, its managerial pickings and all the
other imposts which the non-workers pile on to
the backs of the workers. •- Yet the strange thing is
that, for all his strength, willingness and native
intelligence, the poor fellow wouldn’t have a dog’s
chance of combating these evils or even of keeping
off the dole if. it were not for the ever-vigilant
“Labor” party, which works day and night to
thwart the attempts of employers, Liberal and
Country - party Governments, arbitration - court
judges, landlords, shipping-companies, colliery-
proprietors and bankers to lower his living-
standards and rob him of his rights.
There are, of course, exceptions even among
workers. A worker, however willing and intelligent
he may be, is not a worker if he works or wants to
work when other workers don’t want to work —
or when other workers have been told by their
union-leaders that they shouldn’t work. In those
circumstances, by working he ceases to be a worker
and becomes anti-working-class and un-Australian.
In “Labor” philosophy no worker ever loses his
worker-status by stopping work, either temporarily
or for good. But by stopping at work he may lose
it for ever.
It’s a strange thing, but although “Labor”
claims it has been steadily improving the condi-
tions of the worker for over 60 years, he is still
pictured in “Labor” oratory as being near the
breadline. This, however, is not a compulsory
qualification. No “Labor” M.P. would deny a
ship’s cook the right to call himself, a worker (no
matter what others may call him), even though his'
annual income might be greater than his skipper’s.
But the captain’s right to the appellation would be
considered dubious, to say the least. •
“Labor” M.P.s, of course, are all workers;
none of them would consider that the mere accept-
ance of a salary of £2350 a year, plus a further
£6OO-£BOO expenses, a disqualification. When one
Federal “Labor” member was asked recently
whom he included in the term “worker,” he replied
that he meant everyone who worked for wages.
This can scarcely be right. The party would surely
not accord the honor to non-unionists (see Clyde
Cameron and others on the subject of scabs)? On
the other hand, the definition would exclude farmers
and other self-employed persons, many of whom
“Labor” claims to represent. Nor would it include
the many publicans and bookies who, by their
support of “Labor,” should be considered worthy
of the title.
At the same time, that definition fits-in with
the average man’s conception of what the word
means. Acceptance of it reveals the impudence
of “Labor’s” claim to be the sole guardian of the
rights of the worker —a claim by no means uni-
versally accepted by workers. By far the greater
proportion of the adult population of Australia
work for wages or salary (or are married to one
who does). If every wage- and salary-earner looked
to “Labor” as his only hope in an otherwise hope-
less world there could never be any but “Labor”
Governments in Australia.
“Labor” has lost the last four Federal elections
because hundreds of thousands of workers refuse
to accept it at its own valuation. Other reasons may
be advanced, but they only amount to explanations
of the causes of the refusal; the refusal itself cannot
be denied. What’s more, “Labor” knows it can’t,
and this explains why the party’s policy tends to
be aimed more and more at the less educated and
less intelligent—“the poor old wage-plug,” as
Edmonds, M.H.R. (it is to be hoped affectionately
rather than patronisingly), calls him.
This tendency runs through the speeches of
most “Labor” M.P.S nowadays; the words are
addressed to all workers, but the appeal is more
and more to the unskilled. Dr. Evatt, whose impor-
tation into the Federal Parliament from the High
Court was intended to win votes from the moderate
section of the community, now directs all his
oratory towards convincing “the poor old wage-
plugs” and those branches of the trade-union
movement that have a vested interest in them that
he’s just as much at one with them in heart and
mind as Eddie Ward or Clyde Cameron.
All emphasis is on the rights of the worker as a
worker; nothing is said to suggest that he has any
responsibilities as a member of the community.
The worker should not pay income-tax; that should
come from the profits of the big monopolies. Sales-
tax is an immoral tax; it hits the worker, who
cannot afford to pay it. Increased excise on beer is
a class-tax; the worker has to bear it. It is wrong
to allocate housing-loan money to building-
societies; the worker has no hope of saving-up a
deposit (this although almost all subscribers to
co-operative building-societies are wage- or salary-
earners).
In a community like ours in which the over-
whelming majority of the people are workers in
the proper sense of the word, such* a philosophy is
arrant nonsense. We have a semi-welfare State
with a vast structure of social services from which
most of the community benefit in some degree. As
a community we can only get-out what we put-in.
Individually there will naturally be many who
put-in more than they take-out, but it is ridiculous
to suggest that any large section of the community
while sound in wind and limb is entitled to do all
the taking and no putting. The lot of “the poor old
wage-plug” has improved very'considerably in the
past 20 years, and “Labor”-leaders f claim all the
credit for this improvement. What they do not
tell the workers is that’most of the improvement
has been made at the expense of the skilled workers,
the professional men and persons on small fixed
incomes. Any further improvement that comes on
the same basis of taking-without-putting will be
at the expense of the same people. It is high time
the “Labor” party redefined its terms and explained
that when it speaks of workers it really means
unskilled workers.

London is historic in being a sort of “cross-roads
of Commonwealth” affair. Though the Common-
wealth is called “British,” about three-quarters
of the population of it are either Asiatics or
Africans. The countries which hold the greatest
populations —India and Pakistan—acknowledge
the Crown only in a theoretic way, and are, in fact,
republics.
Ceylon’s Prime Minister has announced that
he intends to move towards republican forms of
government which will sever Ceylon from the
British system. Mr. Strijdom, of South Africa,
intends to move the same way when he can get a
majority-vote of Europeans —the native inhabitants
don’t count. A majority for republicanism in
South Africa means a majority of Dutch origin
and aspirations and a switch in general policy
away from common loyalty to British ideals—a
switch which would create stresses in Natal and
some other areas. y
India and Pakistan, of course, are at logger-
heads. Pakistan stands closer to, and more firmly
with, the racially European members of the Com-
monwealth than India. It has the Afghan problem
along its flank, Russia accessibly next-door. It
knows more about the Russians than do the Indians.
At the same time its policy is wary and colored
by the Kashmir question and religious issues, which
keep it in a state of not-very-cold war with its
bigger Indian neighbor. •
The Ceylon attitude to everybody seems to
be surly and completely Leftist. As with Mr.
Nehru, it is obvious that Mr. Bandaranaike is
alarmed about the Communist bloc. He doesn’t
want to antagonise it, apart from the fact that he
is a Leftist himself, by allowing British bases in his
area. No doubt a lot of quiet pressure is being
exerted on him. The feeling of Red threats hangs
all over southern Asia. So important links in the
Western world defence-chain are to go, and defence-
cohesion is broken.
Ceylon doesn’t, of course, want to lose the
benefits of the Colombo Plan and of Western
trade, but it doesn’t seem ready to co-operate in
world-defence or carry its due responsibilities as
a member of the British Commonwealth.
It is not forthright like Pakistan, which works-
in with other British nations and is prepared openly
to accept U.S. aid;
Add to the problems of Pakistan’s dispute
with India, India’s neutrality and refusal to live
up to its responsibilities in U.N.O. or in Common-
wealth defence, and Bandaranaike’s expulsion of
his associates in the “Commonwealth” from Ceylon
defence-bases those of Malaya and of Arab pressure
at the Red Sea end of the Commonwealth sphere
of influence, and it can’t be said that there is
anything very promising in the air for the mainten-
ance of the Commonwealth in Asia.
In Africa The racial conflict in the Union,
plus the underground determination of the die-,
hard burgher element to obtain complete ascend-
ancy over the British as well as over the native-
population, presents problems enough, But the
Rhodesian-Nyasaland set-up, which has not yet
reached Dominion status and can’t do so for some
years (though its Prime Minister attends the Com-
monwealth is threatened with failure
in its jpolicy of gradualism in the integration of
racial rights. On its flank both the Gold Coast and
Nigeria are feverishly rushing towards an independ-
ence for which they are not culturally ready and
towards complete native domination of the scene.
With all these matters very much to the fore,
the conference has been meeting in London while
other bilateral discussions have gone on about trade-
preferences and defence, which are the main practi-
cal links holding the Commonwealth together. The
U.K. atmosphere surrounding the meeting has been
ond of gloom and industrial discord. The announce-
ment of Australian cuts in imports, affecting
particularly the British motor-trade, was followed
swiftly by the further laying-off of large numbers
of hands in British car-factories. At the same time
came the apnouncement that Germany had assumed
the second-place in the world as a car-manufactur-
ing country. And almost every hour British unions
are making demands for higher wages, and prices
of British materials are going up in response to
wage-rises already granted.
Every day seems to suggest that the time is
coming when the racially European parts of the
British Commonwealth —the United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia and New Zealand —will be the
only remaining portions of a formerly great Empire
which have any hope of forming a cohesive defence-
and-trade bloc in which all secrets can be shared
and all things discussed in complete confidence.
At present it is no longer possible to share
fully secrets with the “neutralist” nations of the
Commonwealth in Asia and Africa who wish to
have things both ways.
It is to be hoped that it will not come to that.
For essential to the safety not only of the British
nations but of the civilised world are a chain of
bases and bountiful specialised resources, such as
rubber and oil, many of which are in the territory
of the “neutralist” members of the Commonwealth.
Trade - preferences, currency and mutual
defence are the ingredients of the cement which
hold the Commonwealth together.
The continuance of the Commonwealth as a
co-operating group depends on the continued pros-
perity, strength and cohesion of the central sources
of the British Commonwealth ideal —those parts of
the British group in which the standards of living
and of industry are at their highest.
. It is vital to maintain the strength of the
United Kingdom and of its economy and defence,
since if this were to collapse Europe would soon
slide into Communism or into war.
It is vital that the policy of the Common-
wealth should keep .the network of British and
Dominion trade intact by reasonable policies of give-
and-take. It is vital also for the British future that
there should be expansion of the racially British
and convenable European population in the great
and so far relatively empty Dominions of Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, in which there is no
racial conflict and each of which has the potential
capacity of resources to make it a new great Power
when sufficiently peopled and developed.
At present all the initiative and drive which
doesn’t trend towards disintegration comes from
these nations. Among these Australia, through Mr.
Menzies, in London is showing the greatest leader-
ship. The first factor in saving the future seems
to be the consolidation of policy of the Dominions
which aren’t divided on the need for united policy
and defence and which feel no flabby urge to sit on
both sides of the fence.
In truth, the Commonwealth might be stronger
without some of its present adherents hanging
round its neck, though, for some, mutual co-opera-
tion is the lifeblood of their security —even oi
continued independent existence.


“WHO’LL BUY MY VI-O-LETS?”


PLAIN ENGLISH
Boys in Crime
Thefts of motor-vehicles Holdens,
chiefly, but ranging from motor-scooters
to caravans —have risen to a record
number in the last few weeks in Victoria,
although they had declined notably after
the Crimes Amendment Act became
operative in January, and sterner punish-
ments, which it permits, were inflicted
on those who steal and illegally use cars.
Upwards of 40 are now being taken
each weekend, the greater proportion by
youths under 21, and most of the balance
by young men under 25. Last year 4003
motor-vehicles were stolen in the State
and 3886 recovered. In the previous
year, a record, 4370 were stolen and
4222 recovered. Most of those not re-
covered are at the bottom of the Yarra,
in the shallows of Port Phillip Bay or
stripped and burnt in secluded hide-outs
not yet discovered.
There are at present seven policemen
exclusively engaged on the detection and
prevention of this widespread and
fashionable crime among youngsters, a
fraction of the number The Force diverts
to discovering whether glasses of beer
are served in pubs at 6.1 p.m. or sipped
after 6.15 p.m., and whether all persons
on the premises after that time are
really there to sit-down to dinner.
Selwyn Porter, the commissioner, now
has announced his intention to increase
the car-stealing squad from seven to 25
men, with their own fleet of vehicles ; but
the edge is rather taken off this by the
fact that a similar announcement was
made by the Police Department nearly
two months ago, with the cheering aside
that Victoria would then have more than
20 men on the job, compared with 13 in
N.S.W., nine in S.A. and six in Queens-
land.
It really shouldn’t require a great deal
of time in a flexible department to divert
men from watching the noggins and
knocking-shops to the more worth-while
effort of minimising, at least, a crime-
wave that may result this year, if not
checked more sharply, in the theft of
motor-vehicles valued at four-million
pounds.
In addition to inter-State and country
trips in stolen cars and suburban trips to
dances and drive-in cinemas, youths have
been responsible for 'some arresting
exploits since January. Two 15-year-olds
have admitted stealing 27 cars, valued at
£28,000, and to using them to steal goods
worth another £7OOO. Another gang,
aged about 16, took petrol with them in
their own cars to fill the cars they
intended to steal, and then drove them
to wooded country where they were
stripped of radio, tyres and other acces-
sories, and then burnt. Police found the
parts of seven cars buried near by when
they caught up with them.
Other juvenile crimes since January
include the theft of a car from near-by
Toorak and its near-destruction in the
Growing Soviet
2B
Yarra by the placing of a block of con-
crete on the accelerator and the letting-
out of the clutch; repeated driving at
80-miles-an-hour through busy streets
when pursued by the police ; the theft of
seven cars by one youth to carry his girl-
friends and his beer ; and damage costing
as much as £6OO to expensive cars.
In the cases of detected joy-
riding, magistrates have invariably
refrained from sending first-offenders to
jail, despite periodic demands by the
press and the police for stern penalties,
because they are confronted so often by
as-yet-unshaven boys and their tearful
mothers or shaken fathers. The magi-
strates’ problem with second-offenders
is simple. They are sent to jail as a
matter of course.
That, however, doesn’t cure many of
them. There are no statistics, unfor-
tunately, on the number of third-time
offenders in the theft and illegal use of
cars, but it is high ; and it is unquestion-
able that those who spend more than a
month in jail learn new tricks from old
hands, as they do in all other criminal
trades.
It may not be popular, but the Vic-
torian magistrates’ reluctance to send
youths to jail for first offences has
advantages for the community. The
imposition of stiffer fines, plus long-term
bonds, with the penalty of a jail term
if they are broken, also have possibilities,
as well as the corporal punishment
ordered by an Adelaide magistrate to be
administered by parents in the presence
of police.
More effective than all, however, would
be the immediate establishment of the
new police-arm for prevention and
detection of the crime, rather than the
mere promise of it.
Government by Gambling
“D.”: For sheer brass, commend me to
Premier Cosgrove’s request to Acting-
Premier Rylah not to implement the
restricted broadcasting plans of Victorian
racing-clubs because it would diminish
Tasmanian Government revenue from
racing betting in Tasmania, much of
which is on Victorian events.
The Victorian clubs’ restrictions, to
operate in the new season beginning in
August, are being made precisely to get
revenue needed for themselves by divert-
ing off-course betting (by people who pay
nothing towards the unkeep of the sport)
to the course, where a levy can be made
to provide stakes and maintenance of
courses.
Rylah wasted little time in refusing, and
the restrictions come into force from
August 1.
A request to direct sporting associations
in one State to continue to lose money to
help pay for little Socialist experiments in
another surely would earn, if it came
off, the Melbourne Mug.
Waterfront Trouble
The current trouble on the waterfront
illustrates the Communist policy of
destroying industrial peace at any cost in
the interests of Red control of national
industry and defence.
The present disputes arise out of judg-
ment given by Ashburner, L, on May 11
and subsequent action by shipowners.
But the issue- is an old one, first raised in
1915. And during World War II the
W.W.F. had blackmailed the industry into
accepting limits. As Mr. Justice Ashburner
remarked, “it was essential that ships
should not be held up, and in consequence
stevedores were in a weak position to take
a stand against demands for smaller sling-
loads and an increased number of men in
the holds.” So restrictive customs grew
up, and the number of men increased on a
“port basis,” resulting in glaring
anomalies and inequalities as between
ports.
'Thus, butter is loaded in 50-case, slings
in Melbourne, but only 45-case slings in
Sydney and 40 in Adelaide. Flour is
loaded in Melbourne 60 bags to the sling,
and in Brisbane only 32 ; wool is loaded
eight bales to the sling in Melbourne, but
only two in Launceston.
Judge Ashburner found that while
refusing to hold, as a matter of principle,
that sling-loads should never in any cir-
cumstances be prescribed, it was his view
that current provisions of the award gave
the men sufficient protection, and that,
“subject to the men being protected
against undue strain and danger, the limit-
ing factor in’sling-loads should be the
safe working-load of the gear and
appliances.” He refused the application
of the W.W.F., which was obviously
aimed at further restrictions of loads, and
declared:
The employers will be given an oppor-
tunity to increase sling-loads at ports where
the present customary level is inefficient.
He made it clear that if this were not
done, or if “in any port it is established
that there is a reduction of existing
sling-loads owing to employers giving
way to job-control”—by allowing the
W.W.F. to dictate its own pace and
method “the Stevedoring Industry
Board is to be at liberty to bring in a
sling-load order for that port.”
The employers set about the job of
placing cargo-handling on a basis of
uniform sling-loads throughout Aus-
tralian ports —a plan which they declared
to be calculated to bring about quicker
handling of cargo and therefore greater
earnings for the wharfies. It was also
calculated to lead to faster turn-round
and reduce costs.
The W.W.F., as usual, then decided to
enforce its own award by calling illegal
strikes throughout the ports. Mr.
Roach, assistant-secretary of the W.W.F.,
completely ignoring the fact that the
changes are the result of a judge’s deci-
sion, made on the union’s application,
has declared that the stoppage, which has
extended to every major port in the
Commonwealth, was “deliberately pro-
voked by the employers to offset the
increase in wages of Bd. per hour.” And
he claims that “the accident-rate in the
industry is 50 p.c, a year,” which is sheer
bunkum.
It is about time that striking, unless
on a majority-vote of the members of a
union taken by secret ballot, was
declared illegal and also that the com-
mon law of damage applied as between
the victims of sabotage strikes and those
who promote them. _ With court- and
commission-protection to both employer
and the worker so highly developed as
at present, the words used in a Norwegian
trade-union education-pamphlet apply
with full force in Australia:
It is unthinkable that wage-disputes
should lead to great conflicts between
workers and employers It is out-of-
date and not economic to protest by wast-
ing labor and stop work methods... .The
strike represents an outmoded viewpoint,
a device when capitalists sat with com-
plete power... .over the whole economy
and govefnment.
Bad Roads
There’s nothing like first-hand know-
ledge to sharpen perception. Since Rylah
returned to the' Vic. Premier’s offices
from Canberra, his lamentations about
the state of the main highways, chiefly
caused by road-hauliers, have been sharp
and sustained. The explanation is that
the Acting-Premier returned by State
car and was taken for a rough ride.
The Country Roads Board’s survey
shows that most transport-operators
play the road game fairly, but that
Vic.-N.S.W. and Vic.-S.A. highways
simply aren’t wide enough, and edges,
particularly after floods, tend to dis-
appear.
Rylah says darkly that although State
Governments can’t tax inter-State trans-
port, they can charge for fair wear-and-
tear on roads. Still, no doubt the High
Court and the Privy Council can smell
a rose by any other name.
Deficit ©a Wheels
The most disquieting thing about the
Cahill train- and tram-fares slug is not
the size of the impost—though the rise
is savagd enough in all conscience—nor
the knowledge that, even if the new fares
bring-in all the money they are expected
to, the transport services will still be in
deficit in the coming year. It is that the
Cahills seem to think that putting-up the
fares is the only step they can take to
improve the position. They seem entirely
to ignore the fact that there are two sides
to a ledger, even in Government-book-
keeping, and that sixpence saved on
expenditure is just as valuable as six-
pence extracted from a passenger.
In the Assembly debate on fares last
week, Cahill and Enticknap had plenty
to say about the necessity for increasing
the fares, but little to say about any
attempts to cut expenses. Cahill’s only
alternative suggestion, it seems, it that
the Commonwealth Government should
meet the transport-deficit. With
unconscious humor the N. S. Wales
Premier said that without the increased
fares the “finances would be in a state of
chaos.” Would be? What sort of state
does the man think they’re in now?
Transport Minister Enticknap also
tried to pass the buck. His explanation
was that it was the fault of “the methods
of financial control in Australia.”. Fie
said that workers had received “hand-
outs” in wage-increases and long-service
leave and employers had received “hand-
outs” in higher interest-rates.
As Cabinet itself was largely responsible
for several elements of the wage-increases
of transport-workers (e.g., continuation
of quarterly-adjustments and weekend
penalty-rates and long-service leave), the
Minister could hardly have been com-
plaining about that. He and his whole
party do, however, object to paying
interest, so the financial control must
refer to the second type of “handout.”
It has been pointed-out here before that
interest now represents a smaller percen-
tage of the railway- and tramway-out-
goings than at any time in the past 30
years; wages, on the other hand, are
taking their highest share.
What is really wanted is a determined
effort to overhaul the expenditure side
of the whole transport-system. When
working-expenses amount to 92.4 per
cent, of revenue (as in the case of
Cahill’s railways) and 119.1 per cent, (his
trams and buses) it is clear that some-
thing besides the interest-bill needs
attention.
-O '
Robust Talk Among Premiers
“Mugga Way”: South Australia’s Tom
Playford found the correct word when,
in moving the vote of thanks to the Acting
Prime Minister, Sir “Artie,” he said the
discussions at Premiers’ Conferences were
always robust, and properly so.
The conference ended after the Loan
Council had sat, ostensibly in secret, for
more than two days, and the Premiers’
Conference had met in public for some-
thing more than half a day. Much time
was devoted by the Loan Council to
condemnation of the backroom releases
to the newspapers of reports described
with some bitterness as “slanted.”
One example was mentioned at the
Premiers’ Conference, when Fadden
referred to a unanimous declaration by
the council that reports published in the
papers that the Commonwealth had
offered to lift the limit of loan-funds if
the States referred to it the power to
control capital - issues were, in fact,
incorrect.
There was no reference, in public, to
the fact that one newspaper published a
speech attributed to a Premier several
hours before the speech was delivered—
and given finally by the Treasurer of the
State in question, not by the Premier.
The present system of Loan Council
control of the nation’s finances has lost
much of whatever value it possessed, and
the secrecy which it affects leaves the way
open for pressures, and for publication of
reports which can be misleading, through
no fault of the journalists concerned. The
first reform move should be agreement
for the admission of the press to all
sessions, as a prelude to adoption of some
better way of handling the people’s
money and the finances of the Common-
wealth and States.
Be Ready!
“In the ACT”; These days the know-
ledge of the power of atomic weapons,
developments in chemical warfare, and
of the guided-missile programmes presents
unprecedented problems of attack and
defence. It also creates major difficulties
in planning to carry out a civil-defence
programme.
Australia has been lagging in even
facing the prospect ; but now an Aus-
tralian civil-defence school has been
started at Mt. Macedon, Victoria.
Opening it, the Minister for the Interior,
Allen Fairhall, recalled Montgomery’s
grim warning that unless the framework
of a sound civil-defence organisation was
established in peace a nation would face
disaster in a world war, “since the home-
front will collapse at the first attack.”
The Minister agreed that all defence-
preparations were a drain on the
economy. The Government was guided
in the scale of its defence-preparations
by its defence-advisers, being mindful
of the fact that if the tempo of civil
defence were raised too high in time of
peace people might well grow tired of
the burden of preparations for a situation
which didn’t develop. Therefore it would
seek to equate the development of civil
defence to the realities of the inter-
national situation.
All civil-defence services needed to be
soundly based on knowledge and experi-
ence, he said:
Through this civil-defence school the
appreciation of our defence-advisers will be
translated into practical preparations to
instruct and advise the Australian people
generally as to what will be expected of
them in times of emergency, and how to
make the greatest contribution to their own
individual, as well as national, survival.
The first aim of the school is to turn-
out an adequate number of well-trained
instructors, beginning with warden and
rescue services. The help of women will
be enlisted through social-servicfis
organisations.
Fairhall hoped that the teachings of
the school would never have to be applied
in practice, but he recalled the slogan of
the Canadian Civil Defence Services —
“You can’t be certain—you can be
ready.” This could well be adopted in
Australia, where our preparations have
lagged, where public .interest has been
lacking, and where there is a sinister
mixture of fatalism and indifference.
Query for Comrade Healy
Whatever is hidden about top-level
doings in Soviet Russia, there is little
doubt about what is happening in the
satellite countries. In eastern Europe
both leaders and workers are showing
open restlessness, especially since the issue
of the reports of the Communist Party’s
Moscow conference and of new line
directing the abolition of the “cult of the
individual”—except, it seems, when the
individual is named Khrushchev.
Accompanying this “return to Lenin-
ism” was a plain inference that criticism
and agitation by the rank-and-file were
to have their place from now onwards in
Communist life behind the Iron Curtain.
Various persons who had been secretly
bumped-off over the past years have been
“rehabilitated posthumously,” and their
relatives have received profound apologies
for the inconvenience caused them by

having their breadwinners shot in the
back of the neick.
Communist leaders abroad have added
to the delusion which seems to have seized
large sections of the Cbmmunised peoples
by criticising Khrushchev’s theses openly
and fairly frankly—but with a strange
regimentation. Each of the critics,
whether he lives in East Germany, Italy,
London or Sydney, seems to have had
exactly the same thoughts, for the most
part expressed in the same Order.
Other people haven’t. Two months ago
a regrettable tendency to deviationism
was noticeable among Czechoslovak uni-
versity-students, which was doubly regret-
table since Czechoslovakia, being the
most industrially advanced and produc-
tive of the Iron Curtain countries, was
being used by the Moscow bloc as its
spearhead in capturing Western trade.
This involved letting large numbers of
Westerners visit Prague and other Czech
cities for exhibitions and business deals
and indoctrination. The Government
was soon alarmed •to discover that
students were turning eagerly to these
imperialists for education about the ways
of the West and actually were showing
admiration for brutal capitalist
imperialism.
In the middle of last month the
harmony of the all-State Conference of
the Czech Communist party was suddenly
disturbed by a wild'outburst from a Com-
rade Mazanek, chairman of the party-
organisation of a large mining-town, who
lashed-out 'at Sovietised bureaucracy
(which, he said, seemed to consume a ton
of paper in producing a ton of coal),
about the dirty conditions of living, dirty
shops, paucity and dearness of goods, low
wages, bad working-conditions and
neglect of plant. Moreover, he was
applauded, and the Communist party’s
local Khrushchev, Comrade Novotny,
general secretary, had to make it plain
that the party wouldn’t stand for the
expression of “incorrect views,” especially
■among students, journalists and workers.
Within a week, however, there was an
outbreak in Poland, at Poznan, head-
quarters of the great Stalin steel-
works. The workers there chose a
moment when the town w(as full of
Western visitors, including leading
journalists, a delegation of 16 British
economists, including Cambridge pro-
fessors, and some members of the Cam-
bridge Municipal Council who were visit-
ing the national trade fair, in which 20
British firms had been allowed to exhibit.
In the middle of the beano, demonstra-
tions broke out in plain sight of the
visitors. The demonstrators converged on
the headquarters of the Polish Communist
Headquarters shouting “We want bread,”
and carrying banners with slogans which
said “Down with Phoney Communism,”
“Down with the Russkies,” “Down with
Soviet Occupation.”
Polish troops were called in by the
security police, but fired, it was reported
by British eyewitnesses, on the security
police themselves and sided with the
crowd. Then Russian troops with T 34
tanks were brought in and hoed into the
helpless crowd. Later leaders of the
trouble were summarily executed.
The Polish Prime Minister attributed
the whole affair to the action of “criminal
provocateurs,” acting for the “foreign
imperialists,” who had deliberately set-out
to Cause these “bloody riots,” in which
something like 50 workers were killed and
about 700 wounded. The only people he
had any praise for were the security police
and the military who did the killing, “only
under provocation.”
Somebody should interview Comrades
Healy and Sharkey about the matter. It
would be interesting to hear from them
how much provocation they think would
be needed to justify turning tank-guns
and automatic arms on a stopwork
demonstration of wharfies or miners.

Tasmania, alone among the States,
finished-up the year with a Budget-sur-
plus. It amounted to £114,000 and can
be attributed to careful budgeting, strict

Drysdale lotteries contributed to the*
Treasury £1,056,000 instead of the
estimated £380,000.

tickets and 25 per cent, on season- and

Council of Churches. From there he went

more complicated than anything thought-

displayed in devising it had been directed

mid-Victorian idea of having first- and

Transport Minister Duggan says the
silvertail carriages are run at a loss
because they’re always half-empty and
many of those who do use them travel on
free passes. He thinks it would be more
economical “to spread the load through
the train.” Another good idea would
be to apply a good blue-pencil to the list

Cahill moaned in a loud voice against
the Federal surplus of £61.3 million.
His complaint wasn’t that Menzies and
Fadden had taken too mttch from the
taxpayers, but that they hadn’t given
enough to him. The truth is that under
the practice prevailing in Federal-State
financial dealings in the last few years
the surplus wasn’t a surplus at all in the
old sense of the word. It was all used
to supplement loans for State works.
When Cahill and other Premiers
objected to. paying interest on the
Federal Government’s loans - out -of -
revenue, Fadden told them .that the
interest was charged so that they wouldn’t
become careless spenders. There may be
something in his argument. Certainly
the Federal habit of paying for develop-
mental works out of revenue, interest-
free, hasn’t encouraged economy among
Federal departments.

That’s good news, as is the announce-

manufacturers who began production at
Granville, near Sydney, last November,
have prepared for world-distribution a
film “extolling the efficiency, enthusiasm

worker.” C, E. Hiltermann, managing-
director of Rothmans in Australia, says
that before coming here he had heard
stories of inefficient work and lacka-
daisical wprkers, but he had found these
to be utter nonsense.
Apart from having our factory at Gran-
ville erected in record time —four months
ahead of schedule, in fact —we now find
that the ratio of output per man-hour is
several per cent, greater here than in any
of our factories overseas.
The film is tp be shown in 70 countries,
and is designed “to indicate that the
Australian worker is ‘tops’ and, in addi-
tion, to make clear that Governmental
red-tape, so far as it affects the setting-up
of a new industry, is practically non-

Cahill Government to introduce a 36-
hour week for all employees under State
awards “to safeguard the health of men

coming of automation and speed-up
methods. Despite the McGrrrrr prece-
dent of beating the gun on the 40-hour
week, the Cahills aren’t likely to be in
the mood for handing-out immediate
gifts against future possibilities. With
the certainty that the same largesse would
have to be offered to all Government
employees, the gesture would mean
increasing the wages-bill on the bank-
rupt Government-transport system by 10
per cent. The resolution was carried on
the very day that the council protested
to the Government about increased fares.
This policy of trying to grab the
benefits of automation before it even

there’ll be no benefits from it at all.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
ONE of Sydney’s most intriguing little
mysteries has been solved, and the
solution shatters yet another of my illu-
sions. The bloke who chalks “Eternity”
in a neat hand on city and suburban
footpaths has revealed his identity. A
72-year-old Pyrmont man claims that his
is the hand that wields the chalk in the
early hours of the morning. He says
that 25 years ago he was a victim of the
Demon Drink, and he suddenly saw the
light. Since then he’s never missed his
morning mission. It’s a sad blow to me.
I could have sworn he intended “Eternity”
to direct the passer-by’s thoughts to the.
Hereafter. And apparently it’s no more
than a confession of how long it seems
since the old chap had his last noggin.—

“Narumee”: The floor-show at the city
hotel was making heavy weather. The
girl vocalist implored the diners to kiss
her sweet, and kiss her simple, but they
continued stolidly to get outside their
tucker. At length the girl, cradling the
microphone against her cheek, advanced
across the floor and approached one of
the masticating males; tenderly she
stooped and crooned into his very red
ear: “Wouldn’t you like to kiss me on
my little dimple?” His ungallant “No”
was fully amplified—and he didn’t even
glance in the location of the small, natural
depression.

“Mac Hoots”: One of the pleasures of
living in the Sydney suburbs is watching
the antics of women drivers who, afraid

drivers. They’re usually to be found
sternly crossing intersections without a

along the middle of the road up the
hills from Pymble to St. Ives, hardly able
to get her nice new car up the slopes,
I stopped on a convenient hilltop and
signalled her, intending to point out that,
since both tail-lights were blazing, she
obviously had her brakes on. She heard
my toot; she saw my hand ; and, giving
me one glare of outraged indignation —
I think she thought I was making
advances to her —wobbled away as fast,

trainline. The ’groom was scheduled to
arrive by the afternoon train, and he had
been warned to tip the guard, asking him
to stop the train at a level-crossing near
the church, thus saving himself a two-
mile walk back. The train was running
late, with the result that the bride arrived
at the church well before the ’groom.
She heard the train approach the crossing,
and she heard it pass without stopping.
That was enough! She collapsed into
her mother’s arms, sobbing, “What’ll
we do with all the food?” She was still
asking when the ’groom arrived half-an-

future winnings must average over £4OOO

designed to cultivate a liking for classical
stuff and a profound contempt for the

a musician of me, but she did succeed
in instilling into my system a distaste,
amounting almost to physical loathing,
of jazz, swing and the rest of it. My
wife had no such inhibitions, so in our
early years of married life we found it
almost impossible to agree on the selec-
tion of radio-programmes. This diffi-
culty no longer exists : for the |>ast 10
years the radio has been tuned
continuously to those sessions demanded
by our offspring—two of them now teen-
agers—and my musical ear has been so
completely reconditioned that I now
actually enjoy such tuneful airs as the

rid of them was the problem—and who

“C.A.L.”: Should the milkman awake
me in the wee sma’ hours I put my head
under the blanket, for his comments on
the person who put the billy out are a
trifle rough, to say the least. Fortunately
his remarks are mostly about “her” or
“she.” I don’t know what the trouble
really is; perhaps the billy-lid is a trifle
tight or he has brought a pint of milk in
and a note has been left for a quart.
My wife, a light sleeper, becomes
incensed at his observations, but I point
out we are not supposed to be awake and
listening at this hour of the morning,
and if we met the man during the day we
might find him quite a gentlemah. We
are easily annoyed at our work during the
day, so should be tolerant of the poor
milk-oh out in a winter’s rain-squall at
3 a.m. N

birthplace at Brightwater, Nelson (N.Z.),
by Professor Darwin should do something

Witold Malcuzynski, the pianist, who
tonight (July 11) begins the Sydney
season of his second Australian tour —he
was here in 1949—-is a Pole whose
fearsome-looking name is really quite
easy to pronounce. The last pupil of his
great compatriot Paderewski, whose
mantle as an interpreter of another Pole,
Chopin, he appears to have inherited,
Malcuzynski won the Grand Prix at the
Chopin Competition for international
pianists at Warsaw when he was 22. A
long European tour followed, and on the
outbreak of war he hurried back to War-
saw for military service, but arrived just
as resistance crumpled, and he and his
wife fled to Paris. When that capital fell
they just beat the Germans again by a
few hours and got away to Lisbon. Since
then he has been in constant demand,
both for recitals and as a soloist with
orchestras —he has appeared with prac-
tically every important orchestra in both
Americas. Making its own complete
comment, it was he who was chosen to
give the Chopin Memorial Recital at the
Palais de Chaillot, Paris, in 1949, cele-
brating the centenary of the composer’s

Yarraside “locals.” He’s managing-
director and editor of Standard News-
papers Pty., Ltd., which controls 12
suburban and two provincial weeklies,

An a room provided for the purpose by
the Museum. It began in 1909, when,
a newly-arrived B.A. from Sheffield Uni-
versity, he was sent by the Museum
authorities to the Mammoth Cave, near
Busselton, to look for remains of pre-
historic marsupials; he joined the
Museum staff the following year.
Investigations at Busselton over a period
of years unearthed remains of the
Tasmanian-wolf, Tasmanian-devil, the
giant echidna, and thousands of relics of
other species. After his return from the
Kaiser’s war, he was placed in charge of
the natural-history section of the
Museum, and then became Curator (name
of that post was changed to Director last
year). Four years ago, he went to Lon-
don to help the Kensington Museum
people identify lizards and insects
collected from the Monte Bellos before
the big burst in 1952. On that trip he
also looked over a collection of snakes
and lizards from Central Australia in the
Frankfurt Museum. A prolific writer, he
has a second edition of his Handbook of
Snakes of Western Australia now with the
printer. Member of various learned
societies, Fellow of the Geological Society
of London and of the Royal Zoological

Scholar, and he has returned with the
other aims (or hopes) of widening Mel-
bourne roads and improving public-
transport to encourage citizens to leave
their cars at .home. From Melbourne

graceful old South Brisbane Town Hall,

addition of air-conditioned studios and
a small but attractive concert-hall.
A one-time Dean of the Faculty of
Music at London University and a
frequent world-traveller ' for Trinity
MUSIC
College, he was on a 17,000-mile tour
of South-East Asia when World War II
broke out. Then into the Indian Army
for four years, with the rank of major.
Happy to find a capable orchestra
already established in Brisbane, he hopes
it will not be long before the Con. can
feed it with musicians, a long-felt need.
A keen concertgoer himself, he talks
enthusiastically," but critically, on musical
interests from Bach to Bartok. His
classes in musical history will take a close
look at the moderns before turning back
to survey the richness of the past, but in
practical work he insists that the classics
must come first.
Impresses as a man who will not stand
much nonsense, and admits to a reputa-
tion as “a bit of a slave-driver.” What

Into the Silence:
At Eastbourne (N.Z.), at 78, Colonel Frank
Symon, for 38 years in the Royal N.Z. Artillery.
He served on Gallipoli and in France and
Belgium in the Kaiser’s war, and commanded
the R.N.Z.A. First Brigade; mentioned in
dispatches twice. Back in N.Z. in 1921, he filled
several commands, and in 1931 was appointed
aide-de-camp to King George V and Director
of Artillery.
In Perth, at 92, Gordon Sprunt, who was
serving in his shop until a few weeks before his
death. He had 10 children, 30 grandchildren,
51 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-
grandchild.
At 93, in Melbourne, John Tait Wilson, shire
clerk at Wintoir (Q.) for many years. He was
bookkeeper on Dagworth station, near Winton,
when “Banjo” Pater Son visited it in 1895, and
was present when “Waltzing Matilda” was com-
posed.
At Richmond, Surrey (Eng.), Mrs. Georgina
Keith-Johnston, granddaughter of Alfred
Domett, journalist, poet, statesman, friend of
Robert Browning, and Premier of JSfew Zealand
in 1862. He returned to England in 1871 and
died there in 1887. In A Century of Australasian
Poetry Douglas Sladen called Domett’s. “Ranolf
and Amohia” the chief achievement in Aus-
tralasian poetry.
At Takapau, Hawkes Bay (N.Z.), at 79, John
Christopher Rolleston, son of the Hon. William
Rolleston, last superintendent of Canterbury.
Educated at Christ’s College and Canterbury
Agricultural College, he farmed in several parts
of New Zealand, served in the Kaiser’s war with
the Canterbury Mounteds and was wounded
at Gallipoli, and represented Waitomo in
Parliament from 1922 to 1928—during the same
period his brother, F. J. Rolleston,
Attorney-General and Minister of Defence and
Justice, represented Timaru.
In Perth at 58, Cyril Joel Moss, theatre-
director and racing man, who moved from
Sydney to Westralia in 1945, and built and

TERRIFYING THOUGHT


ABORIGINALITIES
mixed-farmers enjoy
’ * telling about the kangaroo-pest.
“Kangaroos? Sure, plenty on my place ;
but, now, these foxes. Imported for sport,
they were What, kangaroos? No,
foxes! Spor-t! If I could lay hands on the
blokes who imported those ginger devils
. . . Kangaroos? Of course not! Foxes!
Oh, yes, they’re hard on pasture, but if
you saw what they do .to my lambing
ewes ... Kangaroos? Certainly not —
foxes! Well, aren’t I telling you about
kangaroos? Hunt kangaroos? Me?
Sure; but, mark me, I kill more foxes in
a week than will be hunted in 50 years
by the red-breasted galahs who imported
foxes . . .” There is no help, even in
beer. —“Apemantus.”
* * * *
“Maitri”: Highlight of the year in
country centres 50 years ago was
the annual church social. After
the. ladies had shepherded the men-
folk in, the proceedings would
open with a long prayer, followed
by conversazione —an institution
where everybody was either stricken
dumb or else yelled his hardest. Novel-
ties consisted of Mr. McConachie’s
recital of “Lasca” (he’d rendered it so
often that when he got stuck the whole
congregation was able to help him out)
and Mrs. Slame’s presentation of the
devastatingly tragic ballad “Dead for
Bread.” She always accompanied her-
self on the harmonium, and what the
song lost on the swings of melody was
made-up on the roundabout of length.
Followed a whale of a supper with fat
Mrs. Tarragon going the rounds offering
all hands sugar for their tea. “Help
yourself to sugar,” she’d say, “and I’ll be
back in a jiffy to milk you!”
* * * *
“The Red Dam”: Can add fair testi-
mony on the excellence of anthill cricket-
pitches. In 1918 our sou’-Westralian
bush-school teacher, John Richardson
(cousin of S.Ai’s test-cricketer, A. J.
Richardson), put down our school’s first
pitch, anthill. On a visit the other day I
saw the pitch, still in use, with a surface
reacting like hard rubber.
* * * *
“Raygu”; Potatoes are valuable, and
farmers have found that a bag left in the
paddock overnight means
a bag gone in the morn-
ing. A cocky had to
leave his day’s digging in
the paddock, and re-
ported next day the loss
of 10 bags. Saw him
later in the week and
sympathised with him.
“Lost all my pumpkins,
too,” he told me. “Any
idea who took them?”
“Yes, I know —same bloke who took
my spuds. Tracked him to the same
lorry.” “Who took your spuds, then?”
“That’s just what I’d like to find out,”
he said.
* * * *
“G.M.”: Timber-workers near May-
dena (Tas.) had long speculated on the
age and height of a lofty eucalyptus they
had discovered. Now a Hobart surveyor
has fixed its height at 332 ft. —an Aus-
tralian record. The new champ., estimated
to be 350 years old, topped - by 17ft. the
ex-champ., also a Eucalyptus regnans, in
Victoria’s Cumberland Valley. The
latest is still 36ft. short of the world
record, held by a Californian sequoia at
Bull Flat, Dayerville. However, Tas-
manian Chief Forestry Commissioner
Crane thinks even taller trees may*be
found as cutters for the newsprint
industry push further into the virgin
forests of the Speck’s Styx River valley.
* * * *
“Woorarra”: Have noticed that
dotterels which frequent rocky reefs—as
several species do —are subject to ,foot-
injuries of a minor nature, and limping
birds will be seen in almost any small
flock. As many other fowl, both waders
and sea-birds, move about on rocks
without mishaps, this seems rather
curious. It must be wrong to assume
that dotterels have softer toes than their
associates —Nature wo'uld long ago have
rectified a weakness of that kind. When
startled, dotterels usually scurry off with
short, quick steps instead of flying—
which they are well able to do—and it
may be that their impetuosity in this
respect is responsible for cuts on broken
shells and sharp stones. Possibly, too,
prankish crabs would account for a few
wounds (“dots” are great snoozers)
but beyond these two somewhat dubious
suggestions the matter remains a
mystery to me.
“Once through should cook ’er.”
• “Renraw”: Claim for the world’s
oldest cow is made by the National Trust
of Wales, its entrant a 40-year-old
milker at West Hook farm, Haverford
West, Carmerthenshire. Any juice-
manufacturing machine of near-antiquity
that we can enter in the Longevity
Stakes?
•* * * *
“Ex-R.S.M.”: The last big stand of
red-cedar (B. 20/6/’56) was on the
Atherton Tableland (N.Q.). Burns,
Philp bought the right to -cut it, and
somebody had the bright idea of sending
the logs down the Barron River instead
of hauling them down the mountain-
track by bullock-jinker. With the first
flood of the wet-season the logs started
their journey to the sawmill on the
coastal lowlands ; but as each valuable
log went over the Barron Falls it hit the
big rock-outcrop halfway down and
shattered. Only two logs arrived
intact at the mill. The biggest cedar left
in Queensland, as far as I know, stands
near Lake Barrine, on the north side of
the road. Before the last war its value
was estimated at £l5OO. It isn’t likely
to be cut; like the near-by giant kauri
and the twin pines standing only a foot
apart, it has been preserved as a national
monument.
* * * *
“Spud”: Mechanised fishing. Chap
boating in the present flooded country
north of Wentworth (N.S.W.) caught a
stunned or sick fish by the tail—with
a pair of pliers.
* * * *
“F.A.M.”: Was holidaying with a
retired grazier whose son is studying
forestry at a U.S. university, and great
excitement attended the arrival and
unpacking of a birthday-gift for Dad
from America. Everyone but Dad
uttered “Oh’s” and “Ah’s” of admiration
as it was finally separated from its folds
of tissue-paper. “Stone the crows,” said
,Dad disgustedly, as his wife held up a
handsome blue pullover; “fancy sending
a sheep-man orlon!”
* * * *
“Phil Anthus”: It’s true that many
English starlings domiciled in Australia
have blatantly pinched the voices of many
native-birds (B. 20/6/’56), but I advise
caution in accepting that the
thefts are always reproduced in
the same order. One starling
that used a wattle-tree near
my window as a rostrum had
a repertoire that included the
prattle of the blue-wren (it was
strange to hear this little ground-
bird’s song coming from aloft),
the “sweet-pretty-creature” of
the wagtail, the “peewee” of the
mudlark, and the proclamations
of various other species, and for
day after day he rendered those
calls in regular sequence. YeF
when I brought a brother bird-
ologist along to hear a recital,
and supplied a programme
giving the order of the items,
the performer, for the first time,
changed his sequence. Inci-
dentally, mimetic song was so
much a part of that star-
ling’s life that he had no time
for love-making. It impressed
me to see his mate come along
to his platform and whisper a
few words, whereupon he paused,
hurriedly acted as requested, and*
then hopped back and resumed his
singing; Where else would you find a
male, of any species, as singleminded as
all that?
# * * *
“Brick E.”: In England’s historic
Hampton Court Palace the tourist-brickie
will see niches which could not be dupli-
cated in Australia —because the bricks
required can’t be made here. They are so
soft they can be sawn to the necessary
shape and smoothed on a rubbing-stone;
but the amazing thing is that when the
bricks are laid and exposed to the weather,
instead of fretting away they become
steadily harder.
» * * *
“Geep”: To the list of early navigators
who have become forgotten men add
the Frenchman St. Allouarn. Of all the
French navigators, he alone laid official
claim for France to a single foot of
Australian soil. In March, 1772, he
attempted a landing at the Leeuwin, but
the weather prevented his getting ashore.
Driven north, he landed near Shark Bay,
where he “took possession of the land,
hoisting-a flag and causing a notification
of the fact .... to be read in the form
usual in such cases.” His account of this
uninviting area evidently did not impress
the French authorities, for the claim was
never follpwed-up. But it might have
been different had he managed to land
near the Leeuwin and explore the rich
Margaret River country.
* * * *
QUEENSLAND’S taipan, as correctly
noted by “Archaen” (B. 20/6/’56),
was formerly known as the “giant
brown.” His scientific monicker is
Oxy uranus, scutellatus; pseudonyms,
Maclennan-brown and Peninsula-brown.
Up till the last few years he had been
reported from Cape York Peninsula only;
although recognised as the second-largest
venomous snake in the world, he was con-
sidered so rare as to merit little import-
ance as a public-enemy..
Until the recent saves of a Freshwater
schoolboy and the Mackay charmer who
specialises in taipans, both by the injec-
tion of anti-venene, a giant brown’s bite
was a death-sentence.
Found dead in their camps, two
Peninsula bushmen had scratched
epitaphs on the blackened bottoms of
their billies indicting the taipan. A
Mareeba man, out shooting, died within a
few hours of being bitten ; he reported
a brown-snake had attacked as savagely
as a dog. A Finn canecutter, bitten near
Ingham, ran 50yds. and died in his tracks.
Resenting the death by snakebite of his
two draughthorses, a Mossman farmer
took his gun to clean-up the raider and
fell victim to a taipan. A Sydney snake-
man, within two miles of the Cairns B&se
Hospital, was fatally attacked by a
specimen he had collected.
The distribution of the taipan is much
wider than generally supposed. David
Fleay identified one taken near Gympie.
It is common on the Tableland and down
the coastal strip of the canefields areas.
With its huge poison-glands, and its
biting-apparatus similar to the American
rattlesnake, the taipan (Malay for
“death”) is most aggressive. One which
fell off a load of logs at Kiari savagely
attacked the timber-truck tyre.
Treatment still consists of a ligature and
blood-letting; plus breakneck speed for
anti-venene.
SAN V.
THE QUEENSLAND DOG
A stranger came from New South Wales, and
he was tall and brown.
He lined beside us at the bar, he sank his
schooners down;
And all the time, to pass the time, he told us
doubtful tales
Of the country he laid claim to: remarkable
New South Wales.
With soil so rich and fertile (so ran his line
of talk)
That pumpkin-vines fair sprinted along, as fast
as a man could, walk!
He said it took two hours, sometimes, to walk
through the hollow logs
For timber loomed so broad and tall. And
then he mentioned dogs . . .
Little Maginnis spoke up then, arising from his
seat;
‘1 dunno about them other things, but at dogs
we got you beat.
I was boundary-riding once,” he said, “on a
station Longreach way,
And lost me bearings among the hills, right at
the end of day.
So I let the old horse poke along and find his
own way in the dark
Until in the distance I seen a light. And then
I heard him bark!
Well, station-dogs is mostly noise, I never took
no heed;
I only wanted me bearings (and I could of done
with a feed).
So I went on riding towards the light, just
follering me nose,
And then I hear him bark again—and this
time he’s up close,
I needn’t of worried, he’s only a dag, the sort
cow-cockies keep,
That keep the dingoes away at night, then lay
all day and sleep.
When he gets near me he whines a bit; friendly,
quiet and deep.
Then he stands on hjs hind-legs and licks me
face, and I see his gentle eye
And his dusty coat and wagging tail by the
starlight in the sky . . *
And the horse I was sitting on at the time was
seventeen hands high,” -
The stranger paled and admitted (with the wind
took out of his sails)
That the dogs grow bigger in Queensland than
they do in New South Wales.
QUEENSLAND.
W. N. SCOTT.


PLOUGHING, I killed a 6ft. brown-
snake and hung it on the fence. Next
time I came round three magpies and two
butcher-birds were taking a close, but
not too-close, look at it; a few minutes
later three crows, a kestrel and a peewee
had joined the wake. But Joe com-
manded respect even in death. After
waiting for someone else to be the
bunny, the would-be sextons returned
to the freshly-turned furrow. Every now
and then one of them would take a quick
look at the corpse to make sure that
nobody was stealing a march on him, but
when I knocked-off hours later it
was still as I had left it. —“Heresone.”

“J.H.”: Endean’s drawing of his tyke
reacting to a whistling-kettle (B. 13/6/’56)
is amusing, but has nothing on the
antics of our foxhound. This liver-and-
white mass of vitality, at present leading
a rabbit-pack somewhere between Bourke
and Booligal, taught. himself to release
steam from the pressure-cooker by
joggling the valve with a paw. Less
popular was his trick ,of beating every-
body to the phone and cutting off the call
by pushing the handpiece off its cradle.
Both gestures, of course, were self-protec-
tive. He just couldn’t stand the intensity-
pitch ©f sound made by the pressure-
cooker and the telephone-bell.
* * * *
i / ~ ,
“J. 8.”: Westralian place-names, is it?
Well, I believe they’ve a town over there
with the name Damboring. Some time I
must spend a weekend there, just to see if
it really is.
* * * *
“Sebak”: The fox, a big red beauty,
was out of range of our shotguns ; the
breeze was blowing towards us and he
was unaware of our presence. A dead
20ft. tree-trunk lay on the ground, its
end pointing in the direction Reynard was
travelling. He paused for an instant,
then skipped lightly up on to the log and
walked along it to the other end. There
he dropped off and slipped into the
undergrowth. There could be two
explanations for his Blondin-act: (a) it
was a ruse employed by instinct to break
his trail of scent; ( b ) the idea of walking
along the log appealed to him, just as it
would have seemed like “a bit o’ fun” to
a kid. Strict sticklers for the cunning-of-
a-fox tradition will of course plank foi
(a), but I’m for the second of the explana-
tions. Since he was not taking any
“ How-do-you-do , Mr. Murphy! My, your hands are cold!"
other safety-precautions he obviously
didn’t have a care on his mind. I’d reckon
old Bushy just demonstrated what we
would call a “human trait” in Homo
sapiens.

“Bo”: As reported, a psychiatrist,
after making tests on 1000 children in
Wolverhampton (Eng.), found they were
“18 months brighter” than the pre-war
kids; and, because they were all born in
1945, when the first atom-bombs were
dropped, he announced his conclusion
that “radiation from atom-explosions
may be making children more intelligent.”
At the time of their birth the kids were
at least 8000 miles from Hiroshima, and
since then have never been closer than
3000 miles to the nearest atomic explo-
sion. Of course, they could have pos-
sibly absorbed radioactive ether-waves
through their TV-sets, coming some-
where from outer space —you never know
with science. But is there any authority
who can be positive that radioactive
influence wouldn’t make ’em duller
instead of brainier?
* * * *
“Shamuseen”: I don’t doubt that had
those shearers been told even later that the
babbler had boiled a centipede with the
cabbage they’d eaten (B. 20/6/’56) they’d
have been promptly sick. I recall a war-
time medical officer who, to strengthen
his claims as to the powers of suggestion,
fished out of the boiled custard which
members of the mess had just enjoyed, a
stubby pipe which every diner swore he
recognised as the one normally carried
between the teeth of the cook. The M.O.
continued to absorb his custard, but the
others made a beeline for the mess-door-
way, where their egress was halted by the
cook (a collaborator in the controlled
experiment), who was smoking his usual
pipe. Stomachs subsided instantly when
the M.O. pointed out that the smoke-
piece found in the custard, though an
exact replica of that smoked by the cook,
had never been filled with tobacco nor
smoked.
* * * *
“Leirum”: In a sudden burst of pro-
prietary-mindedness the entire native crew
of the Torres Straits shelling-lugger I was
on bought at the trading-station small
cashboxes in which they carefully locked
their “cash-money.” Later I saw on each
boy’s sleeping-mat his cashbox, with the
key still in the lock, and tied to the box
by the piece of red string by which it had
been secured when bought.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: Anyone know if the fulvous-
honeyeater is a ventriloquist? Watching
one, I heard three distinct calls in
fairly quick succession. The first came
from the bird under observation, the
second sounded about 40ft. away to the
s.-e., the third about the same distance
to the n.-e. I searched the locality care-
fully, but failed to find another bird.
Cayley doesn’t list this small fowl as a
ventriloquist, so maybe I met a feathered
freak. On the other hand, it is probable
that more Australian birds are ventrilo-
quially gifted than is generally accepted.
COW DANCE
I came across her browsing on a slope
Thatched with dry brown fern scythed in a day
Between milkings, the stones hid in each clump
Blunting the brush-hook’s blades, clanging back
Unhuman oaths over the hill’s shoulder
In a noon crackling with summers fierce wit.
There, mooning and nosing about the grass-tops
Chaffed with holocausts of laughing flame
Or full of chuckling juice mellow as mead,
With an inward jolt at sudden confrontation
She looked up fixedly with liquid eyes
Wide as the stretch of innocence that holds
Pellets of gamin treachery, eyes full of
Remorseless motherhood and blind foraging,
With her two stomachs quite outwitting love,
Lust even, in the common faith
Of bull and cowdom: tyranny of gut.
Being on the loose for laughs, I ran at her
And watched her bolt, all belly and backside
With teats like bagpipes slung beneath a
bronco,
For she exploded then, a milk-filled grenade
Gone careering down the slope to the others
Watching her progress with the same wet eyes
Till off they all went, down the hill together,
Horns down, hoofs up, harridans gone dancing
Hell-for-leather; and, as much a part of the
dance.
Centaur-wise I followed in the wake
Of the heifers, leaping down those summer
slopes,
Laughing, shouting, mad with the fun of it all.

RAIN RITES
WHY did R. J. Toughest, editor of that
well-known afternoon-paper, vanish
suddenly from the city scene and have to
lie-up six weeks in a nursing-home? , ,
You haven’t a clue? 'Well, it all
started one day when the mail-boy
dropped this letter on his desk:
“Sir: As a student of anthropology I
should keep this for my thesis. However,
I understand that you pay for articles,
and I do need some money to get back to
the university. I've somehow gone
through it all on my holiday. So let
me know if you want an article about
what’s happening here. In brief, all the
people in this town conduct a pagan rite
to the ancient god of rain. I thought
it might be a little unusual in these times.
Let me know if you would tike the
article. Yours, Cynthia Chaseworthy.”
The address on top said: “Commercial
Hotel, Mullumbarbitone, N.S.W.” . . .
The editor was thoughtful.
“Pagan rites —holy smoke!” he
muttered. ,
“Miss Glubb! Take this telegram:
‘Please send rain ritual story fullest,
soonest —Toughest (Ed.).’ ”
He gave Miss Glubb the name and
address ; then pulled out a directory to
find Mullumbarbitone, but couldn’t*
However, there must have been such
a place, for scarcely a fortnight had
passed before Miss Chaseworthy’s
article arrived. In its package it looked
like the first roughout for Gone with the
Wind.
It read, inter alia : “Sir, Thank you for
your interest. ... my brief holiday from
study brought me to this tiny hamlet nest-
ling in the hills on the North Coast”
(Toughest circled that—he knew where it
was now). “Everything was quite normal
at the hotel until one day at breakfast the
manager said to his wife: ‘Tell the cook
not to throw out that old baking-dish or
the cake-tins. I’ll want them for the
rain.’
“Later, when I saw him \yalking with a
ladder and a baking-dish I approached
him .... I told him of my interest in
primitive rites .... I asked him straight
out, ‘How can a baking-dish and a ladder
make it rain?’
“He feigned incomprehension (this is
quite common in these circumstances),
but when I told him I knew all, when 1
repeated his own words ‘for the rain’ he
knew he was beaten. He had met his
match.
“He smiled (resignedly, I think) and
said he would show me .... he followed
me up a ladder through a manhole up
under the tiled roof there on
the ceiling you wouldn’t believe
it, Mr. Toughest the publican
had gathered dozens of tins for the rites.
He explained that of all the different
shapes and sizes the deity liked baking-
dishes best. He explained that the rite
proper would not take place until the
winter solstice and suggested I come
.back then. The tins, he said, were for
special incenses and offerings.
“I asked, ‘Do you wear robes?’....
they did —mainly black, with trimmings
from the fur of the great spotted kanga-
roo .... the head man in the rites seems
to be someone named Clancy (I think he’s
a disreputable-looking man who cuts
sleepers for the railway and spends a lot
of time in the public bar).
“After lunch, believe it or not, Mr.
Toughest, four men from the town took
me on a tour with the publican’s ladder
and the publican came too. We went to
places like the court-house and the light-
company and the grain-store in
every ceiling I climbed to the story was
the same .... there were tins everywhere,
gathered for the rain rites.”
Toughest put it down and pressed his
buzzer.
In came the chief sub-editor. Toughest
threw him the package, saying: “Do this
up for tomorrow —we’re going to lead on
it. Give her a by-line. Bring up the
robes. We can get Pictorial to do us
some shots of someone in robes and
hoods. We’re going to play it big.”
He called Miss Glubb: “Send this off:
‘Congratulations splendid. Wiring
expenses. Toughest (Ed.).’ ”
Then he drew out a slip of copy-paper
and started scribbling next day’s poster.
Next morning he was reading the
banner-headlines of the first edition:
“BLACK MAGlC—Druids In the
North.”
The phone rang.
“Hullo,” he said in the big friendly
voice he acquired when he felt satisfied,
when he had the complete scoop on the
opposition.
“Oh, this is Cynthia Chaseworthy.
I’m telephoning from Mullumbarbitone.
It might be important”
“Miss Chaseworthy! I’m delighted to
hear your voice. This is a big grand
day for you and me, Miss Chaseworthy.
What’s on your mind, my dear?”
“It’s about my article, Mr. Toughest.
I think there’s a slight chance that I’ve
been misled.”
“Miss Chaseworthy! It’s a bad line.
Did you say ‘misled’?”
“I think so, Mr. Toughest. It’s like
this. The men have been still taking
me around showing me ceilings with the
publican’s ladder.
“I was up the ladder at the dry-
cleaner’s this morning and the men were
giving me some wonderful additional'
information when the dry-cleaner’s wife
came in. The men were standing around
the bottom of the ladder. She went up
to them and there was an argument, Mr.
Toughest. Later, when all the men had
gone, she took me aside. Do you know
what she said?”
“No! No! What?”
“She said it was all wrong about the
rites. She said no one wore robes and
they didn’t burn incense and they didn’t
put offerings in the tins.
“She said they put the tins in the roofs
so that the rain would drip into them
through the holes. It would never quite
fill them up, and before it rained again
the water in them would have evaporated.
She said they all do that here in Mullum-
barbitone —it was a dodge one of them
learnt from a carpenter . . .
“What did you say, Mr. Toughest?
Are you making those funny noises?”
Toughest was. He was down on the
floor eating the wickerwork of his waste-
paper-basket. And that’s how they found
him.

COMMONWEALTH revenue
for 1955-56 was £6l million
in excess of expenditure, com-
pared with an estimated surplus
of £48.7 million, and an actual
surplus of £7O million in 1954-55.
The 1955-56 surplus will be

indebtedness.
Consolidated revenue, assisted
by new excise and sales-tax
levies imposed in March, was
£l6 million in excess of estimates.
Expenditure was a net £3 million
above estimates.
Public loan-raisings in Aus-
tralia last year provided £100.4
million (including £7 million
counterpart funds from Inter-
national Bank loans) towards the
States’ works-and-housing pro-

D. 5. Wylie on Sangara
[From D. S. Wylie, managing-
director, Sangara (Holdings), Ftd.,
Sangara, Popondetta, Papua.]
Referring to your review
of Sangara (Holdings), Ltd.
(B. 13/6/’56), here is additional
information.
Production. Production of
rubber has more than doubled
since I came to Papua, shortly
after Sangara Plantation and
Development Co., Ltd., the
operating co. of Sangara (Hold-
ings), Ltd., commenced.
The introduction of outside
labor has reduced absenteeism to
a low level, whereas until
October, 1955, we persevered
with local labor; at times
absenteeism was very high, and
owing to the labor laws nothing
could be done about it.
The average production for the
year ended April 30, 1956, was
34.0001 b. a month, whilst the
average production for the four
months ended May 31, 1956, was
42,0141 b. a month from the same
area..
We have ready for production
an area equal to nearly a third
of that already being tapped ;
this area has been tapped, but it
was found to be economically
unsound to persevere with it until
a later date. Part of the area
was young at the time of the
Mt. Lamington eruption, and
was left uncleaned for a con-
siderable period ; in consequence,
some trees were retarded. We
consider that this area will be
fully tappable in about four to
six months, and should increase
production by at least 50001 b.
per month to start with, increas-
ing as time goes on.
The other area was damaged
by the Mt. Lamington disaster,
and, though we recently tried out
tapping, we finally decided that
12 months should elapse before
the trees could be profitably
tapped. This will increase our
production considerably.
In May we produced 45,7611 b.,
and June, with one less tapping-
day, won’t be far short of that.
We have ordered a creping-
machine to deal with scrap and
ground-scrap, the _ latter never
having been touched.
Capital. The capital of the
co. is high, but it must be remem-
bered that the original co.,
Sangafa Rubber Plantations,
Ltd., had two major disasters to
contend with, and in 1943 had
practically to start again. Every
certificate-holder received shares
to the value of £lOO for each acre
held in the main area, or £75
in the subsidiary area, while until
November, 1952, all certificate-
holders got an annual of 5 p.c.,
in most cases, and 4| p.c. in
others, on their investment, so
that any suggestion of having to
wait for years for a return is
unfounded. Many certificate-
holders have had back more than
50 p.c. of their original invest-
ment. Other assets were taken
over at cost or valuation, the
original co., Sangara Rubber
Plantations, Ltd., losing consider-
ably on the deal.
Present estimates for clearing
aftd bringing into production an
acre of rubber is considerably
more than £lOO, and had any
other form been adopted for the
raising of capital it is unlikely
that this part of Papua would
have been developed to the
extent it is. Our pioneering has
brought in many more settlers in
recent years.
I came here over three years
ago to put matters right, and by
a process of elimination I have
now a good staff, but the experi-
ence has been a difficult one. It
was also necessary to watch
expenditure carefully as the co.
commenced operations with
neither bank-balance nor cash
“Hold it — We've got five minutes to go!"
and had to rely on my bank
guarantee and advances to carry
on—that position has now
ceased to exist.
Some 30 years or so ago The
Bulletin severely criticised me
over the formation of New
Zealand Perpetual Forests, Ltd.,
and later Putararu Pine and Pulp
Co. (N.Z.), Ltd. Through no
fault of mine or the original
directors of N.Z. Perpetual
Forests, Ltd., returns to the
investors were delayed beyond
the 20-25 years estimated, but
the reconstituted co. has made
substantial profits, most of which
are being put back into the busi-
ness. This co. is now doing what
I visualised would be done.
As regards Putararu Pine and
Pulp Co. (N.Z.), Ltd., original
plans were upset by the war.
However, shareholders are now
getting returns which, while not
large, show most investors a
return of nearly 8 p.c. on their
original outlay, and which will
continue for about 30 ydars, by
which time the area will be
reafforested. The land itself
devoid of trees would now be
worth 60 p.c. of the original
capital of the co.
These companies have contri-
buted very considerably *to the
economy of New Zealand, and
I have mentioned them to bring
to The Bulletin’s notice the
fact that, in spite of its criticism,
these cos. have been successful
and served a useful purpose, in
the same way that I feel Sangara
Plantation and Development Co.,
Lfil., will serve a useful purpose
and give its shareholders fair, if
not handsome, returns.
[“The Bulletin” is pleased that
Spngara shows prospects of yielding
all shareholders. some return from
rubher-production in future. It has
no doubt that Mr. Wylie has done
good work on the plantations, anti
that he has had great difficulties to
overcome. But it maintains that the
method used to raise funds and de-
velop plantations 14-15 years ago
was a particularly expensive and
overglamorised one, and that at that
time it should have cost much less
than £lOO an acre to establish
rubber-trees. (The co. charged £75
then.)
However, the present problem is
how to do best with what the co.
has managed to develop and main-
tain, and Mr. Wylie appears to be
working hard and enthusiastically
(and with a degree of success) in
this regard.
So far as N.Z. Perpetual Forests,
Ltd. (now N.Z. Forest Products), and
Putararu are concerned, they were
both an expensive method of buying
into pine-plantations. After 30
years N.Z.F.P. looks like yielding a
modest return to ord.-shareholders,
and may in time become an excellent
investment to those buying shares
at this juncture. But it has been an
unsatisfactory investment in its
long-windedness, and many hopeful
speculators of the 1920’s died, bit-
terly disappointed, without getting
a cracker out of it. The national
value of the timber now is, however,
undoubted.
With regard to Putararu Pine and
Pulp Co. (N.Z.), Ltd., ah essential
to a satisfactory investment is
negotiability. The listing.of shares
In this co. on the Stock Exchanges
is long overdue.l
Sydney Retail Trade
/COMMENTS by the chair-
man of Mark Foy’s, Ltd.
(generally regarded as one of
Sydney’s more alert retailers), to
shareholders at the annual
meeting:
The current year, of which we are
now in the second quarter, has shown •
enough to satisfy us that this year will
be an extremely difficult one. We
need a substantial lift in turnover to
bring in sufficient gross profit to off-
set the heavier expenses, and that lift
is not yet indicated.
I believe it will take the retail trade
eighteen months to adjust itself to the
increased wages and taxation it has
to bear. At a time when there is a
lull in trade and turnover difficult to
maintain there is generally a tempta-
tion to attain more turnover by
underselling even to the point of loss.
Until this tendency wears itself but it
will not be possible to adjust mark-
ups to the level required to maintain
reasonable profit.
Chairman Macken pointed out
also that payroll-tax paid by the
co. amounted to about 5 p.c. on
its ord, capital. Faced with
increased wages, the burden is
likely to grow ; and profits are
subject to increase of Is. in
the £ in company-tax. Accord-
ing to Mark Foy’s figures, as
long ago # as last October the
boom had quietened-down;
“prosperity was once more, just
around the corner, but going in
the opposite direction.”
Taxation should be the sub-
ject of sober thought by the
Commonwealth Treasurer be-
fore his next Budget is
presented. In correcting
economic unbalance it should be
used as an instrument, not as a
bludgeon.
Minster, Ltd.
SUPPORT for Minister, Ltd.,
shares sent them from 345.
6d. to 375. last week following
announcement of the intention
to increase nominal capital from
£1,000,000 to £2,000,000. The
market, which came back to
355. 9d., is counting on a bonus-
issue and increased earnings
after the new plant-unit of
Westminster Carpets, Ltd., gets
into operation. Plant and stock
of a recently-acquired subsidiary,
Sydney Cotton Mills, is being
sold to Davies, Coop. Sydney
premises are what Minster needs.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
MAORILAND has raised the
first dollar-loan in its
history—l3-million dollars from
the Export-Import Bank of
Washington.
A loan of 16-million dollars
at 4i p.c., repayable in 20 equal
half-yearly instalments, was
arranged more than a year ago
to meet dollar expenditure by
the Tasman Pulp and Paper Co.,
Ltd., on the big Murapara forest-
utilisation project and by the
Government on associated works.
None of the money was
uplifted till last month (June),
and three-million dollars is being
held back meantime.
It is on the cards that N.Z. may
seek additional dollar-finance.
The commercial attache at the
American Embassy, Mr. W.
Kling, said recently that expan-
sion of trade with New Zealand
and increased dollar-investment
in the Dominion were being
encouraged by the U.S. Govern-
ment. “We are not peddling our
money, but it is there if you
want it,” he said.
Two representatives of Kidder,
Peabody and Co., the big
American investment banking-
house, were in Wellington at the
end of May and spent several
days in conference with Treasury
officials.
They refused to discuss the
purpose of their visit, and no
statement about it was made by
the Government.
New Zealand will definitely
need another overseas loan from
some source before long.
Finance Minister Watts, speak-
ing in the House just before the
recent adjournment, said that,
though the Dominion had a high
standard of living, it still had a
pioneer economy and would
have to borrow overseas to
ensure continued development.
A high rate of capital-
investment, unmatched by sav-
ings, has been a potent factor in
recent excessive credit-creation
and the running-down of
overseas reserves.
Spending or Saving?
Attempts are now being made
to reduce spending and stimulate
saving. But a huge programme
of public and private investment
remains necessary to provide for
a population which will increase
by 50 p.c. in the next 20 to 25
years.
The Treasury, in its evidence
before the recent Monetary Com-
mission, said that the minimum
rate of investment required
exceeded the savings which could
be expected from the community.
“In fact,” it said, “the level
of savings has been high, but the
capital requirement is now so
heavy that it will be necessary to
have recourse to some overseas
borrowing to finance additional
development.” It added that
N.Z. was at present in a position
to support a series of moderate
loans from overseas markets to
develop the economy.
This is borne out by published
statistics. Annual interest on
overseas public debt at March 31,
1955, was only 1.1 p.c. of the
value of exports, against 9.5 p.c.
at March, 1940, and 8.5 p.c. at
March, 1945. The .Dominion has
an unblemished record of loan-
repayment.
Prudently used, overseas loans
could in the future, as they have
in the past, increase production
sufficiently to offset both repay-
ment of principal and interest
charges.
The United Kingdom has been
the traditional source of New
Zealand’s overseas loans. In the
year to March, 1955, £lO million
was raised on the London market
and another £lO million was
converted.
Borrowing in London is now
more expensive and more
difficult. The U.K. Government,
whose permission is required,
must have regard to the claims
of competing borrowers.
New Zealand may turn to the
United States. A good case can
be made for a dollar-loan. In
spite of control over dollar-
imports, Maoriland has, except
for a year or two following the
wool-boom, been in deficit in its
balance-of-payments with the
dollar-area. This has neces-
sitated net drawings on the
sterling-area’s dollar-reserves.
A dollar-loan, by enabling
N.Z. to restrict its drawings,
would help to conserve the
dollar-pool.
The Monetary Commission, in
its recent report, drew attention
to these facts.
Assuming that dollar-imports
were restricted to items essential
to the country’s economic
development, N.Z. could quite
properly borrow in the dollar-
afea in conformity with general
sterling-area policy, it said.
Dollars and Industry •
If the Government doesn’t
borrow for its own development
purposes, it might sponsor addi-
tional dollar-loans to private
enterprise. The country’s huge
exotic pine-forests are growing
more rapidly than they can be
turned into timber, pulp and
paper by existing plant. Tasman
Pulp and Paper may require
more dollars for a proposed
geothermal-steam plant. The
Government holds £2 million of
the £6 million of ordinary-share
capital in this company. In
addition, it has agreed to advance
the co. up to £l2 million, and
has so far advanced more than
£4.5 million.
N.Z. Forest Products pro-
poses spending £8 million in the
next few years on additional
plant. It might welcome a dollar-
loan.
New Zealand could simplify
its overseas borrowing by joining
the International Bank for Re-
construction and Development.
But it would first have to join the
International Monetary Fund.
And that is strongly opposed,
not only by the Labor Opposi-
tion, but also by several members
of the Government. The Gov-
ernment would like to join, but
is considered unlikely to force
the issue in view of the fact that
it faces an election next year.
Effects of Disinflation
Though bank overdrafts are
still £l5 million above the level
to which the Government has
indicated it desires to see them
reduced, the current disinfla-
tionary programme is now
making itself plainly felt in
business and industry.
An increasing number of com-
panies are reporting difficulties
due to capital-issues control,
bank-credit restraint and hire-
purchase regulation. Phrases
such as “adverse trading condi-
tions” and “marked increase in
debtors” are appearing with
noticeable regularity in annual
reports.
This is to be expected. The
Government’s objective is to
reduce spending. To the extent
that it succeeds there must be
some reduction in turnovers,
with a consequent adverse
profit-trend, until, at least
theoretically, lower costs provide
a compensating factor.
Investment Confidence
Investment confidence remains
strong. Over the last five months
rises and falls in prices of first-
class shares have been fairly
evenly balanced.
Front-rank companies will no
doubt have both the desire, and
the ability to withstand any
likely setback without reducing
dividends. Shares of less-
soundly-based companies may
suffer.
The economic adviser to the
Reserve Bank, A. R. Low, in a
recent address, said:
The Reserve Bank is watching the
situation very closely because it has
no intention of impeding normal
growth and development or of inter-
fering with prosperity. But the pro-
cess of controlling inflation, no matter
what the method used, is likely to
weed out those firms which can exist
only in the hothouse atmosphere of
inflation and sellers’ markets. They
will be firms which are inefficient
and/or badly financed, with too high
a level of current liabilities. If they
cannot put their house in order, their
elimination will strengthen, not
weaken, the economy-; If a policy is
to be called off merely because it
hurts someone, we may as well resign
ourselves to economic chaos.

The WILD CAL
COLUMN
General Motors-Holden’s, Ltd.
CJTILL turning-out cars and profits
at a remarkable rate, the earnings of
G.M -H. have aroused both wild and
reasoned comment from a variety of
sources. This isn’t surprising, for, even
after considering the volume of funds
utilised, the total profit of over £27
million in the past three years must be
considered, at least, as highly lucrative.
However, with the parent firm, the giant
General Motors Corporation of U.S.A.,
claiming a profit of $1 billion (U.S.) for
1955, the Australian contribution amounts
to a little over 2 p.c. It is the dollar-
drain involved in remittance of Australian
dividends to U.S.A. that is the real cause
of debate.
The position occupied by G.M.-H. in
the motor-vehicle industry of a dollar-
hungry country lends considerable interest
to its achievements, although no
ordinary shares are held in Australia. In
1955 the company provided 34.3 p.c. of'
the vehicles registered, Holden production
passing the quarter-million mark in
January, ’56.
Production of vehicles has continued
to climb, but at a slightly lower rate than
that of the previous two years:

The share of the market held by
G.M.-H. vehicles is still below their pre-
war figure, but with post-war expansion,
completed and planned, to the tune of
nearly £5O million, the emphasis may
shift from production to sales. The
development of plants at Dandenong
(Vic.) and Brisbane (Q.) is expected to
result in the production of Holden
vehicles at the rate of 100,000 p.a. by
late 1957 or early 1958, compared with
63,800 during- 1955. Until some modi-
fication is made to New Zealand import-
restrictions, exports of Holden vehicles
remain a mere trickle. This is unfor-
tunate, as the widening of the export-
market could offset, to a degree, the
foreign-exchange involved in the ord.-
div. payment.
The recent increase in sales-tax has
had a steadying influence on new-car
sales, but it is an encouraging* fact that a
Holden sedan can still be bought for a
price lower than the 1952 level. In spite
of stiffening competition, G.M.-H. is in
an excellent position to maintain its share
of the market and meet the challenge
thrown out recently by the chairman of
the British Motor Corporation.
A restyled Holden is to appear on the
Australian roads shortly.-
Kelvinator Australia, Ltd. (Adel.)
Kelvinator Australia, Ltd.,
has again proved its ability to operate
successfully in a highly competitive
market. Latest accounts (to March) tell
of gr-eater turnover and improved'profits,
ordinary-shareholders receiving a 15 p.c.
div., the seventh at this rate in the last
eight years.
Enjoying a high reputation as manu-
facturers of commercial and domestic
refrigeration-units, the co. and its sub-
sidiaries also produce electric petrol-
pumps, washing-machines, window air-
conditioners and other electrical and
domestic appliances. With the future
television-market in mind, the first radio-
sets bearing the Kelvinator brand were
offered to the public during the year.
Based in Adelaide, the 24-year-old
company caters for an Australia-wide
market. -
A one-for-two cash-issue during the
year added £337,500 to the ordinary
capital, now £1,012,500. There are also
6 p.c. participating prefs. (£20,000), 6 p.c.
fixed prefs. (£20,000) and 5 p.c. fixed
prefs. (£190,000), bringing the share-
register total to £1,242,500. The co. last
term also raised a mortgage-loan of
£250,000.
The management reports that “con-
siderable progress has been made in the
reduction of production-costs”—no mean
feat in these high-cost days—and this
achievement, coupled with higher turn-
over, provided the basis for a successful
year’s trading in spite of the levelling-off
in the demand for domestic refrigerators.

After providing £138,762 for pref. and
ord. divs., £154,375 was added to reserves,
which, after an appropriation of £29,041
to cover an insufficient provision for taxa-
tion, showed a net gain of £125,334 for
the year. The earning-rate of 12.3 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds compares favor-
ably with last term’s 12.4 p.c., bearing in
mind the increased capital. After pay-
ment of pref. divs. the return on ord.
capital amounted to 27.7 p.c., as against
33.4, 33, 25.8 and 29.4 p.c. back to 1952.
In common with most of its com-
petitors, Kelvinator showed a heavy
carry-over of stock from the 1954-55
period. The extent of its success in the
year under review is indicated by the
reduction of £772,807 in stocks to
£1,349,868, despite increased production.
Funds provided by this movement, new
capital and mortgage have greatly streng-
thened the liquidity of the co. and will
assist during the winter “build-up” period
of production.
As part of a long-term plan to consolid-
ate scattered factories, most of the
£120,000 spent on premises was used for
the construction of new factory-buildings.
Expenditure on plant and equipment
amounted to £70,000, but the impact of
the capital-outlay is considerably reduced
by the generous provision for deprecia-
tion. Freehold and leasehold properties,
at a book-value of £504,158, were up
£62,931, and plant down £28,156 at
£461,790:

With cash and deposits now totalling
£1,279,316, against only £7216 last term,
and debtors up £240,488 to £436,855,
current assets account for 76 p.c. of all
assets. In the last accounts only one total
is shown for creditors and provision for
taxation. At £1,305,638 this figure is
£198,782 higher than the combined totals
at the end of the previous term. Reserves
are strong at £1,134,937, and, with the
paid-up capital, amount to a fraction
under 59 p.c. of balance-sheet totals.
Prospects for the current term are good.
Strong competition can be expected, but
the co. is well provided with modern
equipment, skilled management and
adequate funds. Sales of domestic
refrigerators are steady at a level a little
below that of last year, and deep-freeze
units are increasing in popularity.
Last sale of the f.-p. ss. ords. brought
Bs. ? to yield 9.4 p.c. on a 15 p.c. div. The
pref. shares are not often seen on the
market.
Prefs. have priority as to dividend and
return of capital and also share in any
surplus assets. Net tangible backing for
each £1 of paid capital amounts to 38s.

Edwards Dunlop and Co., Ltd.
T AST year’s three-for-five bonus-issue,
which the sharemarket had antici-
pated, was the first to come shareholders’
way since £50,000 of reserves was capi-
talised in 1920, just five years after die
public first became interested in the co.
Reinforced by substantial amounts of
premiums gathered in with new share-
capital and by withdrawals from inner
reserves, accumulations had grown to a
visible £1,142,217 at the beginning of the
term, to which another £163,000 was
added before the gift-giving during the
year. On completion of the issue, capital
stood at £1,154,223, on which a dividend
was paid at the rate of 10 p.c. a year,
equal to 16 p.c. on capital as it was
before the bonus.
The div. is closer now to an actual
return of 10 p.c. on the total of capital-
and-premium put up by shareholders in
past years. It called for £113,619 of the
£117,397 of net profit disclosed last term
after making provision for all charges
and expenses, depreciation and taxation.
Down £2765 on the previous year, the
showing was equal to 10.2 p.c. on
increased capital:

Activities over the last few years have
been hampered by the rationing of
imports, particularly of printing-
machinery, but, encouragingly, Australian
mills have lately been able to supply a
considerably bigger proportion of the
paper and boards sold by the co. Jn
Sydney, because the return on funds
employed has been inadequate, it has
been decided to close down the depart-
ments handling toys and fancy-goods.
During the year the co. completed a
new warehouse in the Adelaide suburb
of Hindmarsh. In addition to the branch
there and the Sydney head-office the co.
has branches at Melbourne, Brisbane,
Perth and Newcastle, and a London office
controlled by Edwards Dunlop and Co.
(London). Completion of the Adelaide
building and the writing-up and writing-
down of freeholds to less than “inde-
pendent 1955 valuation” are shown in a
net addition to the parent co.’s fixed assets
of £208,005: }

N.T. Gas “Blow”
FROM L. Owen: The latest
gas-“blow” to be reported
in this part of the world is in
the Northern Territory, where a
well being sunk for water on
tfle Amaroo pastoral property,
160 miles n.-e. of Alice Springs,
“unleashed a terrific blast of
natural gases” from the depth
of 130 ft. This was on June 29.
There is no reason to doubt
the correctness of the report,
which has now been confirmed
by the N.T. Director of Mines,
C. F. Adams, after personal
investigation. In the meantime,
Darwin —following the pattern
set by Port Moresby, Brisbane
and Perth on past occasions —
has been gripped by petroleum
hysteria, which was not
(although it should have been)
calmed down by a factual state-
ment made by the Director of
Mines and a member of the
Oil Advisory Committee, R. J.
Withnall, who accompanied
him.
In his report the director
stated that the bore had been
deepened to 176 ft. and that the
gas had been located as issuing
from what appeared to be a
fissure or a fault at 170 ft. On
July 3, at an unstated depth
(presumably slightly below
176 ft.), “greyish "strata which
might be limestone of Cambrian
age” were encountered. During
the drilling oilslicks were
observed, “but these irtight be
the result of gas condensing.” It
wasn’t considered possible to
judge if the gas-source might
be “kerosene - bearing shale,
coal or an oil-deposit,” and it
was stressed that it remained to
be seen whether the gas-find
was of economic importance or
not.
Firstly, it can be accepted
that the pressure of the gas,
when struck, was much higher
than would normally be antici-
pated for the shallow depth of
170 ft. This indicates that the
original sealing-off of the gas-
bearing lense occurred when
the overburden was very much
thicker. That, in its turn, sug-
gests that substantial erosion
has occurred subsequent to the
sealing-off. The occurrence of
substantial erosion brings in the
possibility of the breaching of
major reservoirs and the dissi-
pation of any oil and gas which
might have been there.
The statement in the official
report that “The gas smells like
dieseline but more aromatic”
indicates the probability of the
gas being “wet,” but too much
should not be made of this
point, and any final verdict must
await the results of chemical
analyses.
At worst, however, the gas-
strike allows room for con-
trolled optimism and justifies
and demands further investiga-
tions, which, it is to be hoped,
will be undertaken by geologists
with adequate experience in pro-
ducing oilfields, especially as
the age of the beds in which
the gas was encountered appears
to be Cambrian. This fact at
once calls for extreme caution.
Surveys in U.S.A. (the only
region from which sound data
are available on this particular
point) show that the figure for
combined past production and
proved reserves of petroleum
within the Cambrian in 1950
amounted only to a tenth of one
per cent, of the corresponding
total figure for the full geologi-
cal column. To date, this ratio
has not shown any substantial
change.
Rutile Developments
'TWO interesting cables came
from London last week con-
cerning rutile.
The mineral will be mined on
a large scale on Bathurst Island,
north of Darwin, by Dowsett
Holdings, Ltd., of which Sir
Claude Auchinleck (B. 4/7 / ’56),
who recently visited Australia, is
chairman. A new type of dredge
is to be built in Britain for the
project, which should be in
operation within a year or 18
months.
The other cable mentioned
slower sales of rutile in London,
with the market easing to about
£llO sterling a ton for 95 p.c.
material. Supplies at present are
more abundant than immediate
demand.
Imperial Chemical Industries
recently announced that in Eng-
land it was producing titanium
of the highest purity at the
world’s lowest price. 1.C.1. metal
is made in small granular (not
sponge) * form, and is better-
suited for alloying and melting.
The 1.C.1. method is the
sodium process, but whether the
titanium comes from rutile or
ilmenite-slag isn’t clear from the
announcement.
Meantime, in Australia, no
day goes past without its
announcement from some rutile-
prospecting co. or another.
Illustrative of one aspect of
the boom in rutile at present is
the case of Rye Park Scheelite,
N.L. It was formed to mine
scheelite near Boorowa (N.S.W.)
when King Island Scheelite was
doing so well in Bass Strait and
attracting speculative attention.
In the uranium-mining boom
Rye Park went peregrinating
looking for uranium-ore. Now
it is beachcombing for rutile on
the N.S.W. North Coast, like so
many other concerns.
The rutile industry has de-
veloped into something of major
importance in Australia. New
deposits, like that on Bathurst
Island, are revealed every few
weeks. There is a big demand
for titanium by the aircraft
industry, and if it is sustained
the better-situated Australian co.
should do well. But there will
be the usual abundance of crash-
ing optimists combined with
sharemarket overspeculation.
Freighters, Ltd.
TN the remarkable Freighters,
Ltd., de-listing in Melbourne,
the Crown Law Department
acted first and then started
to think about it. Almost a week
elapsed after the proclamation
before the Attorney-General
announced tersely the depart-
ment had no evidence reflecting
on Freighters’ financial stability.
The department had no
investigator ready when the
proclamation was made. The
investigation (by P. D. Phillips,
Q.C., it was revealed on Friday)
is to proceed apparently in the
stateliest fashion into matters
concerning the allocating of,
consideration for, and circum-
stances surrounding, shares
issued in 1950 and 1951; and
for any unfortunate who may
need money for his shares in a
hurry it will be simply a case of
hard cheese.

SYDNEY
National Days were a feature of the
week’s gaieties in Sydney, Canada cele-
brating its Confederation Day first, with
a party given by Commercial Counsellor
J. C. Britton and Mrs. Britton at their
Woollahra home. There was Canadian
salmon and rye at the party, but no red-
coated mounties or quintuplets.
Next came the American national-day,
the Glorious Fourth, with, all sorts of
parties, receptions, etc. The most spec-
tacular was, of course, the ball at the
Trocadero attended by 1000 people. No
one could forget the date which was beipg
celebrated, for a model of the Liberty
Bell which was rung in Philadelphia in
1776 hung in the foyer, the band was
dressed in military uniforms of that time,
and a tableau, called “The Spirit of ’76”
and founded on a painting in the Marble-
head City Hall, was presented. Popcorn,
American number - plates, and that
wonderful, and traditional, display of
sparklers held by 1000 hands and lighting
the hall, were also features of the ball.
Guests-of-honor were American Consul-
General Donald Kennedy and Philippines
Ambassador Dr. Roberto Regala and
Mrs. Regala, who had motored up from
Canberra for the ball, which was
sponsored by the American Society.

Few Sydney women would agree with
the wife bf the South African Prime
Minister, Mrs. Susanna Strijjom, who
said in a press interview that “a menu is
too intimate to discuss.” Judging by the
crowds that have thronged David Jones’
George-street store for the televised cook-
ing-demonstrations by American expert
Mrs. Dione Lucas, menus and the cook-
ing pf food therefor are about the most
interesting things they can find to discuss;
much more interesting than television, at
any rate, for in spite of the numerous
receiving-sets arranged around the room,
all eyes were on the demonstrator and
the wonders she was creating so effort-
lessly.
There is no doubt that such demon-
strations will do much to raise the
standard of cooking in this city, for who
could see the fluffy chees e-souffle, the
spectacular crown of lamb (stuffed with
sausage-meat and apple, garnished w r ith
wine-gravy, hearts of celery, baby-carrots
and tree-tomatoes), and the delicious rum-
babas, and then be Satisfied with her own
round of stew, grill, cottage-pie, spaghetti-
in-sauce and Sunday roast-dinner?

Everyone is talking about the delight-
ful Spanish singer Victoria de los Angeles,
who has been drawing such large audi-
ences to the Town Hall during the week.
There is a warmth and vitality about her
that is most attractive, and she is
essentially natural and friendly. At the
reception given for her by the committee
of the Sydney Symphony .Orchestra she
wore a navy dress with a platinum-mink
stole and topped it off with a little pink
hat swathed with pink chiffon and
trimmed with pink-and-white lilac. The
hat, said her husband, Mr. Enrique
Magrina, had been bought in Sydney,
but mostly' she buys her clothes from
Spanish couturiers. Mr. Arnold Hirst,
president of the Orchestral Committee,
welcomed her to the reception with Mrs.
A. H. Chartres, and Sir Richard Boyer
spoke the official words of welcome.

Lotteries seem to be springing up all
over the place with heads on them like
mice. The latest is the State Govern-
ment’s “Jackpot” lottery, whereby if
you win a prize and your ticket-number
is made-up of the last figure in the five
big-prize numbers, then you win £4OOO
also. It seems rather unfair that winning
a prize should make one eligible for the
jackpot. It would be rather kinder to
give it to a ticket-holder who has not
won a prize. But perhaps kindness is not
the object of lotteries.

Definitely something to watch will be
the “Springtime with Yqni and Lillibelle”
dinner at Prince’s on August 2, for not
only will there be the preview of the
Lamotte spring collection but also there
will be the '“Lamotte Story” told in fiats
worn by well-known Sydney women.
These hats go back over the full span
of Countess d’Espinay’s career as a
designer, and they should arouse many a
nostalgic sigh, as well as admiration and
perhaps some amusement, over the kind
of thing we put on our heads in the past,
not like our lovely pudding-basins
and flower-pots of today. Non-dancers, as
well as dancers, should enjoy this dinner.
There will be plenty to keep one enter-
tained.

Fares, of course, are on everyone’s

In the news you may have missed is
the fact, now established, that women’s
shoes with 1 heels up to two-and-a-half
inches high are only a little more tiring to
wear tfian flat-heeled shoes. This was
discovered by measurements at Guy’s
Hospital, London, of the muscle-activity
in the legs of 21 young women wearing
shoes of various heights. Ballet-type shoes
with no heels, however, are tiring, and
also shoes with spiky heels.
MELBOURNE
Five-hundred guests attended the two
late-afternoon parties given on July 4
by U.S. Consul-General Gerald Warner
and Mrs. Warner to celebrate Inde-
pendence Day ; in the foyer of their home
in South Yarra the Australian Flag and
Old Glory were displayed. The hostess
chose an ink-blue silk-shantung jacket-
suit. Mrs. Joseph Weidenmeyer, wife of
the U.S. Consul, wore an attractive black
silk-faille frock, with the blouse featur-
ing an insert of white silk; her tiny pill-
box hat was of black velvet. Mrs. John
Mack had brought from her Mt. Mace-
don home the lovely flowers which she
had arranged in the reception-rooms.
Betty, Anne and Deborah Warner assisted
their parents.
Among the guests were Lieut.-Genera!
Sir Sydney Rowell and Lady Rowell, Sir

In jocular mood, Sir John Latham,
president of the Australian-American
Association, said at the Independence Day
luncheon in the Royale Ballroom that
Americans were celebrating their Day of
Independence, but it was the British
Thanksgiving Day. Replicas of the
American Eagle, the Stars and Stripes and
the Australian Flag were used in the
decorations.
Federal Cabinet Ministers present were
R. G. Casey and Harold Holt, with their
wives. The Lord Mayor and Lady
Selleck were in the official party, as were
U.S. Consul-General Gerald Warner and
Mrs. Warner. Also noticed were Air-

it will be ready for the Olympic Games,
to provide a home for the thousands of
sailors who will be in this city. Mrs.
Aarons has a lovely home at Caulfield,
where, with her husband and son, she
entertains often. Mr. and Mrs. Aarons

Parker, of Corowa (N.S.W.), and Mrs. J.
Parker, of South Yarra, to Robert Errol,
elder son of Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Jones,
oi Daysdale (N.S.W.). A princess-gown
ot embroidered nylon-organza was the
choice ol the bride. A deep, square
neckline was a feature of the long-
sleeved bodice, and the full skirt fell into
a train. The full-length tulle veil was
caught by a tiara of pearls and diamente
flowers, and she carried a trail of cycla-
men. Enid Smith and Jeanette Carroll,
both of Corowa, were bridesmaids. They
wore short princess-frocks of japonica
brocaded-satin and in their hair sere
coronets of white satin rouleaux and
white flowers ; attached to their waists
was a rope of flowers falling in a circle
to the hem of their skirts. James Moss
was best man and lan Izon groomsman.
Reception was at No. 9 Darling-street.

The St. Kilda Palais was decorated by
the American Women’s Auxiliary to the
Royal Children’s Hospital in white and
silver for their Silver Anniversary Ball.
At the foyer-entrance was a large
“cake,” cleverly made from cardboard,
frosted white, decorated with white, and
silver leaves and with one large white
candle. The orchestra-stand was also
decorated to resemble a cake ; round the
edge was a thick ruching of silver-paper,
making a background for 25 white
candles. There were trails of silver leaves
and white flowers on every table, and
all around the ballroom were white
candles with silver flames, and white-
andisilver balloons floated above the
dancers. At the back of the official-
table was a silver screen, and ip front
of it two large white urns filled with
white blossom. On the tables were bowls
of white camellias and silver leaves.
When an outsize white birthday-“cake”
was wheeled round the floor the top
layer was removed and a couple emerged
to dance the Anniversary Waltz.
The Governor and Lady Brooks and
their daughter, Mrs. Robin Byrne, were
received by the president of the auxiliary
(Mrs. J. Weidenmeyer) and her U.S.
Consul husband. Lady Brooks chose
a filmy evening-gown of shell-pink tulle
with* white guipure-lac'e appliqued on
the wide skirt and off-shoulder neckline.
Mrs. Weidenmeyer’s gown of delustred
satin was in petal-pink tonings ; it had
a high Empire-bodice, off-the-shoulder
neckline and slim skirt.
In the large official party were the Lord
Mayor and Lady Mayoress, (Sir Frank

pink satin, with a satin cummerbund)
and Mrs. Claudia Creswick (whose
sheath-frock of spice-brown satin was
embroidered all pver with pearls and
bronze sequins). Association president
Harold Jones was present with his wife
and daughter Janipe.
Mrs. Jack Steele wore an attractive
gowp of cipnamon-brown tulle sparkling
with rhinestones and gold sequins; Mrs.
A. G. Silk’s short frock of grey satin
was covered with pear-shaped pearls;
Mrs. R. E. F. Smith covered her blonde

Victoria de Los Angeles
The Spanish soprano, who
began her Australian tour for
the A.B.C. in Sydney last week,
has a voice of beautiful quality
throughout a gamut which
extends right down into mezzo
range. It is faultlessly produced,
and her breathing—or apparent
absence of it —is a lesson to all
aspiring singers. To those the
singer adds an admirable
enunciation and interpretative
powers which met fully the severe
testing to which she subjected
them.
The soprano began her first
recital with one of the longest,
most difficult and most austere
excerpts from off-the-beaten-
track opera: “Iphigenie’s
Dream,” from Gluck’s “Iphigenie
en Tauride.” This recitative and
aria is well within the compass,
but all its difficulties lie under
the surface, and it calls for phras-
ing of the utmost subtlety and
sure control. Miss de los Angeles
swept serenely through all the
snags as if they didn’t exist. As
well, she captured completely the
poignancy and anguish of this
narrative of the exiled daughter
of Agamemnon.
Other arias from seldom-heard
operas included those from
Lully’s “Therese,” Campra’s
“Fetes Venitiennes,” Monte-
verdi’s “Orpheus” and Scar-
latti’s “Pino and Demetrio,” all
enchantingly sung.
In “Oh, Had I Jubal’s Lyre,”
from Handel’s oratorio,
“Joshua,” the fast, lilting
passages demonstrated the facile
flexibility of the voice to perfec-
tion ; and that part of the text,
“Oh, had I Miriam’s voice,” was
sung with such beauty that it
seemed a pointless, wish.
Turning to the lied, the
soprano was equally authori-
tative. There was passion in
Schubert’s “Restless Love” and
Schumann’s famous “Ich Grolle
Nicht.” Schubert’s “Whither,”
the first of his wonderful suc-
cession of brook-songs, was all
gaiety and sunshine, and his “To
Music” was sung with the right
touch of devotion. Brahms’s
“Vain Suit” was an essay in
mischievousness.
The “Kaddish,” from Ravel’s
“Two Hebrew Melodies,” con-
taining as spare an accompani-
ment as could be devised, was
sparing lyricism, and there were
worth-while songs by Pizzetti,
Stravinsky and Berlioz.
In each of her first three
recitals the soprano finished with
a group of seven Spanish songs.
Nearly all were heavily invested
with the folk-motif, especially
those by Nin, Vives, Granados
and Rodrigo, and here the
soprano was at her sparkling
best. Most of the songs had the
typical accent on rhythm, though
the languorous love-song was
also well in evidence.
Paul Berl was generally a good
accompanist, though there were
times when his touch was too
staccato.

State Occasion
From London: Despite some
accomplished and really vigorous
dancing, the programme of
“dance, song and music” given
by the Hungarian State Com-
pany at the Palace Theatre does
not add up to very much in
terms of art. Perhaps this is
because the style of presentation
is so blatant—Liszt’s second
rhapsody, for example, is one
long music-hall act of showing-
off. The rustic items, however,
are fresh and effective.
The composition of the
gipsy orchestra is intriguing.
Most of the string-players are
obviously conservatoire-trained
and of high technical ability.
The wind-players (three clarinets
and a descant recorder) certainly
command virtuosity, but the tone
of the clarinets is rough and
.uneven over the registers. This
might well suggest that, for
reasons of professional exigency,
some of Hungary’s finest instru-,
mentalists are combined with
self-taught gipsy musicians.
It is rather as if the Vienna
vState Opera had gone entirely
Tirolean, or as if Helpmann had
arranged the choreography and
Vaughan Williams the music for
a grand improvisation of
“Knees Up, Mother Brown.”
One ' observer, who knew
Budapest between the wars, sus-
pected that, given a free hand,
the resources _of talent would
have been deployed to better
effect; that what he saw was a
brave attempt by a proud and
independent subject-nation to
triumph over its limitations.
Any reference to even the
pettiest bourgeois is excluded
from the ballets, which are com-
pletely working-class, and the
underlying leit motif is,
apparently, the color, virility
and glorification of the prole-
tariat. The demeanor of the
choir, for instance, combines the
gravity of the fifth form at
speech-day with the dedication
'of a choral society. In one
scene the choreographer has
overcome his difficulties by
clever tailoring, but otherwise
the severity of peasant dress is
inapt and monotonous.
The company numbers 170.
Besides a director, three artistic
directors, a choir-master and the
usual back-stage staff*, there are
also a medical adviser and two
interpreters. All of which sug-
gests a considerable amount of
travelling in countries under
Russian domination.
At the Palace the audience,
one suspected, was substantially
drawn from members of the
British - Hungarian Friendship
Society. Their reaction was of
slight amazement, turning to
pleasure. Emigrd Hungarians,
remembering an essentially
aristocratic outlook that had all
the virtues and failings arising
from pride, intelligence, good
breeding, generosity and inde-
pendence, are less likely to be
carried away.

“I Am a Camera”
This play by John van Druten,
put on by Melbourne Little
Theatre at the Arrow Theatre, is
ingenious in idea if somewhat
facetious in feeling.
Christopher Isherwood js a
young writer who earns a pre-
carious living in 1930-Berlin
teaching English. He feels that
life distracts him too much from
his writing, so decides to turn a
cameralike eye on the scene
around him and, so to speak,
photograph it. The wide-open,
unwinking lens of his eye, he
thinks, will be completely
objective.
But when one of his own
pupils, a warm-hearted but
muddle-headed girl, waltzes in
and announces she is pregnant
by a deserting lover and asks
what she is to do about it, even
the most heartless camera would
find it hard to be objective. The
problem has no difficulty for the
German landlady—she takes her
to a complaisant doctor.
No sooner has this situation
been satisfactorily settled than
a German friend comes in and
tells the camera that the Nazis
have started a pogrom, that he
is himself a Jew, although he has
kept the fact secret, and what are
his friends going to do about
that? The girl impulsively
rushes out and harangues a mob
of Germans for their stupidity
and cruelty, and gets beaten-up.
This is too much for the camera.
His blood boils and he rushes to
her rescue. They return bleeding
and battered to his apartments,
only to find that the landlady has
been listening to Nazi propa-
ganda on the wireless and she
takes a poor view of their
behavior.
A way out is provided by a
boisterous Yankee who offers
to take them on a world tour.
This delights the girl, because she
thinks she might pick up a rich
husband, but frightens the young
writer, as he is afraid it might
divert him. In the midst of
these confusions the girl's
mother, a ferocious lady, arrives
by plane from England full of
love because her daughter has
told her that the camera is her
lover with honorable intentions.
Meantime, however, the girl has
found another fancy, and the
young writer is left meta-
phorically cranking the handle
of his machine after his subject-
matter has departed.
There is nothing profound
about the play, but Van Druten
has made an interesting point in
an amusing, if somewhat heart-
less, fashion. James Inglis, as
the camera, and Charmian Jacka,
as his sitter, were best among
the actors.

“Twelfth Night”
Shakspeare makes such
demands on dramatic societies
that even an unsuccessful
attempt on one of his plays has
the salutary effect of revealing
weaknesses concealed in other
performances.
Stiff, all dramatic societies
should attempt him regularly, but
they should deploy all their
resources of talent and cash if
the assault is intended seriously.
The actors must be able to speak
and to move properly, and they
must be dressed and wigged in a
manner fitting the occasion—
“short back and sides” will
never do.
Because these elementary
requirements are not met, the
current Canberra Repertory per-
formance of “Twelfth Night” is
very disappointing. Added to
which, a misconceived and under-
produced Malvolio behaves in a
way that should have made his
charming mistress show him the
door long before the curtain
opens.
Yet there were some good
things. Edwin Ride’s Feste was
excellent on all scores, and Peter
Steer as Sir Toby was original
in appearance and style. But
they could not hold the shaky
structure together. _

by director Joseph Mankiewicz
right to the end. The dances all

The plot, incidentally, is about

Bob Anders becomes overseer of
Yakaparni cattle-station far out
in Central Queensland. City
bank-manager Forster has
arranged the appointment, know-
ing that owner Carson is letting
the property run-down. The
fault lies partly with Carson, who
loves the station but hates cattle-
work : more to blame is head
station-hand Albert Newton,
who leaves after a showdown.
Bob, advised by Dilargo town-
ship pubkeeper Curly Ryan,
engages as a new team tough
little horseman Wonga Watkins,
Mick Grey, Stevp Hartley and
Duffy Spooner. Mrs. Carson,
fond of her explosive husband,
but with no illusions about him,
talks to Bob of her young
teenage daughter Julia, school-
ing in the city, and mentions
Carla Greer, daughter of the
township’s popular doctor. Bob,
Wonga and the rest are now just
finishing a mustering.
CHAPTER IX
o Continued)
THE sun was just rising
when we saw the mob.
They were in a patch of
thick box-saplings, feed-
ing quietly back to the scrub.
Straight away we knew we had
not seen this mob before. A big
roan bullock in the lead made
that obvious.
The advantages were with us.
We had seen them before they
saw us, and a short gallop would
put us between them and the
scrub. With care and luck we
might even have their retreat
cut off before they were aware
of the danger.
“We’ll swing them through
the saplings and out to the open
ironbark country,” I whispered.
“Keep them on the run till
they're well out in the open.”
I took the lead, and we moved
cautiously ahead in single-file,
five silent riders, each guiding
his horse carefully around fallen
branches and sticks that might
crack like a pistol-shot under a
hoof and start the mob racing
headlong for the scrub.
On our right-hand was 'the
brigalow, tall grey-green trees
rising above the dense under-
growth of wilga, lawyer-vine and
prickly-pear. On our left were
the box-saplings, the dew on
their leaves glittering in the
early-morning sun, the stunted
bushes between their massed;
trunks at times hiding the cattle
completely.
Underfoot were the melon-,
holes, criss-crossed with fallen
tree-trunks and branches. It Was
not country for a timid or in-
experienced horseman.
I suppose a big-game hunter
feels as we felt then, tense with
excitement, waiting for the
critical moment. I know my
heart was pounding at the sight
of the bullocks in the lead of
that mob—huge old scrubber
bullocks with wickedly sweeping
horns.
A stick cracked, ending the
suspense. If it had been a
starting-gun and the cattle pro-
fessional sprinters they could
not have got into their stride
quicker. And we were with
them, leaping instantly from
a cautious walk to a reckless
gallop.
Behind me someone yelled,
“Holy saints, look at them
bullocks! ”
We swung them in the first
furious rush, had them galloping
for the open country, when
things went wrong.
I don’t know how the mess
started ; you seldom do on such
hectic occasions, and that is
what causes those longwinded
discussions around the campfire
afterwards.
Duffy’s fall may have been
to blame. His mare put' her
foot in a hole, and horse and
rider crashed down. Both were
on their feet immediately, just
in time to see an old cow wheel
smartly and break back. Duffy
swore later he could feel the
wind of her as she flashed past
him.
Within seconds the whole
mob had turned, not following
a leader now, but breaking fan-
wise as individual beasts,' They
knew the game better than we
did, though we might have
wheeled them again if Mick had
done the right thing.
We had turned about then, so
that he was in the lead, with
Steve behind him and me next.
Wonga was in the tail, and
Duffy still trying to catch his
mare.
The roan bullock was making
the pace, with Mick close behind
him. The scrub was getting
near, but there was still time
for Mick to close with the
bullock and shoulder him round.
Had he done that we might have
been able to swing the rest of
the mob after him.
But Mick was not made that
way. He couldn’t see what was
going on behind him, and at
that stage I doubt if he cared.
The roan, a massive beast with
a horn-spread that even Mick’s
outflung arms could not have
adequately described, was brush-
ing saplings aside in his reck-
less flight, and his tail was
streaming out behind him tempt-
ingly. Too temptingly for Mick.
He reached out, grasped the
tail and threw the bullock. As
an exhibition of tossing it was
a spectacular success. Speed
and its own great weight sent the
bullock rolling over and over
in a cloud of dust, and Mick
was on to it before it had >
finished rolling.
A spectacular success from
Mick’s point of view, but an
annoying failure from mine.
With two men out of action and
the cattle fanning-out we no
longer had a chance of wheeling
the mob.
Steve swung in behind a big
mickey, his intention obvious ; I
reined-in and watched the rest of
the mob vanishing like wallabies
•into* the scrub; and Wonga
cantered off to catch the two
riderless horses.
IMICK was crouched over the
roan bullock’s hindquarters.
He had forced its tail between its
legs, drawn the tail tightly up
against the flank and twisted the
long brush around his hand. No
I felt he must even have understood Rustin when he said, “Out that staggy-looking
bloke," or, "Take that yellow slab-sided thing next.”
matter how the beast struggled
it couldn’t get up while he kept
that grip on it.
“Didn’t he come a bloody
beaut?” Mick asked, as I rode
up. “Did y’ see ’im roll?”
He was grinning from ear to
ear.
“You damned fool,” I raved,
“we’ve lost the whole mob
now, thanks to you!”
Still grinning* he said, “Aw,
come orf it, boss. We wasn’t in
the hunt with ’em once Duffy
got the buster.” He patted the
bullock’s flank with his free
hand. “Anyway, we got this
bloke out of it. Ain’t he a little
beaut? ’Ang onto ’im, will y’,
boss, while I roll a smoke?”
“I won’t hang on to him,” I
told him irritably. “I’ve a bloody
good mind to sack you instead.
What good is one scrub bullock
to us?” The roan bullock threw
its head up in a wild effort to
struggle free, and I pointed to
its ears. “Look at it, you no-
hoper! It’s not even one of
jours.”
The knowledge would have
abashed most men, but not this
cheerful larrikin. He had known
all along that this was pot a
Yakaparni bullock, even knew
the rightful owner, as his next
remark showed.
“Belongs to old Nelson Porter
over on the river, and I bet ’e
‘pinched it. Biggest cattle-duffer
in the district.” He lifted his
knee to reveal a heavily scarred
brand on the bullock’s rump.
“Pity the brand’s so plain on
’im, or we could shove the Yaka
earmark on ’im. Only need to
widen that bit in the end of ’is
ear and cut a bit out underneath
and old Nelson’d never know
the difference.”
The idea of duffing from a
duffer amused him so much that
he laughed heartily.
“Anyway,” he finished, “we’ve
taken the sting outa this bloke.
He’ll be a bit more civilised next
time we strike ’im.”
The grinning fool knew as
well as I did how untrue that
last statement was. A beast that
has been thrown once is not easy
to throw the second time. The
memory "of the fall stays with
him, and he is apt to wheel
smartly and meet the next horse-
man head-on.
And this one was to prove
no exception. It was nearly
two years before we saw him
again, and his memory was still
good. He proved a very nasty
customer to handle.
“Let him up,” I said. “And
I hope he puts you up a tree.”
I knew what mood the bullock
would be in. Being safely
mounted I should have attracted
its attention while Mick slipped
quietly away. But because I felt
that a bit' of a fright would be
good for Mick I merely with-
drew to a safe distance.
It was wishful-thinking. Where
horses and cattle were con-
cerned Mick didn’t know the
meaning of fear. He released his
hold and sprinted smartly to
the nearest sturdy sapling. The
bullock staggered to its feet and
charged after him. Slobbering
with rage, it lunged first one
way and then the other. It made
several vicious passes before
deciding it was wasting its time
and energy.
The simple truth was that
Mick could get around that
sapling faster than it could. With
a snort of disgust the bullock
broke off the attack and trotted
into the scrub.
VXfONGA and Duffy, each
leading a horse, rode up
then. Duffy appeared none the
worse for his fall, his only com-
plaint being that Steve’s horse
was “a terrible crook leader.”
“Steve’s got a big mickey
down,” Wonga said, passing
Mick his reins. “He wants you
to come over and cut and ear-
mark ’im.”
I waited for Mick to mount
and said, “Right-oh. Let’s get
cracking. At least Steve had the
sense not to pick on someone
else’s bullock.”
We converted Steve’s mickey
into a Yakaparni steer and let
him go. As far as I was con-
cerned that ended the muster.
The sun was well up over the
tree-tops, and we were not likely
to pick-up any fresh mobs in
the heat of the day.
Few of the cattle down this
end camped on the water like
normal quiet cattle do. They
camped well back, usually close
to some brigalow, and sneaked
down to the main waterholes
early in the morning or late in
the evening. I had adopted the
practice of disturbing them on
their camping-grounds when-
ever possible, even if we had had
them in the yard the day before.
They bolted as soon as they
saw us, but we always raced to
the lead and blocked them. We
would them till they
settled-down, and then slip away
and leave them to think things
over.
Sooner or later they would
respond to this treatment, I
knew. Even the wildest of them
would realise there was no future
in galloping away every time a
horseman approached.
We flushed and blocked
several mobs on our way back
to the yards, and though they
had all been dipped recently, I
considered the time well spent.
It served two purposes, for,
besides educating the cattle, it
pleased the boys. They got all
the thrill of the chase without
the monotony of the long drive
to the yards.
“We goin’ to stay down here
another week and have a go at
the scrubbers?”
The question came from
Duffy, as he edged his horse
close to mine and looked at me
expectantly, but I knew who
had prompted it. Mick evidently
felt that he was not the ideal one
to bring the subject up at the
moment.
We were nearing the yards,
and I knew I would have to give
a decision. Had I followed my
own inclinations I would have
said “No.” I had done very
little scrubber-running, but I had
a poor opinion of it both as a
sport and a commercial venture.
To enjoy it you had to be
built on Mick’s lines—short of
brains and overloaded with
recklessness. I was not really
good in scrub, and I knew it.
The thought of racing madly
through timber so dense that
you could see no more than a
few yards beyond your horse’s
ears failed to thrill me; and to
make it a paying proposition
you had to have outstanding
luck and everything in your
favor. If you had that you came
out of the scrub with a few
head of cattle. If not, you came
out with crippled horses and


material enough for a long
session around the campfire that
night.
‘Til put it up to Mr. Carson,”
I said. “We’ll wait at the camp
till he comes out for the gear. If
he hasn’t got oth'er plans for us
and doesn’t mind running us
out some more tucker I’m will-
ing to stay on.”
CARSON did have other plans.
He was waiting for us at
the camp when we got back, and
he was in a decidedly irritable
mood.
“Where’s the cattle?” he
demanded. “What have you
been doing all the morning?
I’ve been waiting here for you
for five solid hours, and you
come home with nothing. Not
a damned thing.”
I started to explain, but he
interrupted me hotly. “Some-
one’s been shooting ducks.
Don’t tell me they haven’t.
There’s duck-feathers all over
the place and not one blasted
duck left on the lagoon. You’ve
shot the lot. What are you sup-
posed to be doing out here —
duck-shooting or mustering?
You get back here in the middle
of the day with your horses
in a lather of sweat, and not
one damned beast between the
lot of you. What have you been
up to? Chasing blasted emus,
I suppose.”
“Yes,” I said, losing my
temper. “That’s about the only
description that fits your damned
cattle. Most of the emus I’ve
seen are quiet compared with
them.”
“Oh.” He calmed down at
once. “Been having some trouble
with them, eh?”
Miek butted-in then. He said,
with his usual grin, “Mr. Carson,
you never yet bred the beast
that could give us trouble.” And
Wonga added, “Like milkers’
poddies, they are.”
Carson hoisted his pants up
and rubbed his stomach
tenderly.
“What the devil have you
done with all the beef I brought
out?” he asked peevishly.
“There’s not a blasted thing to
eat in the camp. I’ve been
through all the gear half-a-dozen
times. What the hell have you
been living on?”
I felt like saying, “Ducks and
emus,” but I refrained. I knew
what was the matter with him
now, and in a way I could sym-
pathise with him. For some
reason he had left home early,
driving off on an empty stomach
and counting on having break-
fast with us.
But his luck was right out.
Some of our beef had gone bad
and we had thrown it out ;
apart from tea and sugar, the
only nourishment in sight was
a section of raw pumpkin. He
had made himself some tea, and
it only made him hungrier.
I could picture him poking
around the camp, listening for
the bellow of cattle that would
announce our return, and
growing more desperate and
irritable every hour.
It was a wonder he failed to
realise that the cafrtpoven was
missing. Wonga had made a
Stew in it the night before. The
last scraps of corned-beef, our
last potatoes and onions and two
wood-ducks had gone into it.
Mick’s shotgun had scared the
other ducks away.
Wonga, the perfect cook,
would not risk leaving it by the
fire where it might boil away
or burn ; he had put it in the
hole he used for making
dampers, and had covered it
with ashes to keep it warm.
“You’d better come and have
a feed,” I said to Carson.
“There’s enough here for all
of us.”
He looked amazed as Wonga
lifted the campoven out and
carefully dusted the ashes off the
lid. I could see him swallowing
in anticipation as Wonga
ladled out the first plateful
and passed it to him, but he
said gruffly, “No, thanks; no,
thanks. Eat your meal. I’ll
start packing the gear up.”
“Get it into y’,” Wonga said,
pushing the plate into his hand.
“Duck-an’‘Corned-beef stoo. It

hasn’t killed these other blokes
vet, so one feed of it won’t
kill y’.”
Carson said nothing when
Wonga refilled his plate, and at
the third helping he only said,
“Sure you can spare it?” before
wading-in.
“That was the best stew I’ve
ever tasted,’ he announced at
last. “You know, I was starting
to get a bit peckish, waiting for
you to turn-up.”
“What was the idea qf coming
out so early?” I asked. “I didn’t
expect you till after lunch.”
“By jove, I forgot to tell you.”
He gave a gentle belch of satis-
faction. “There’s a buyer coming
to look at the bullocks. I told
him we’d start mustering on
Monday, and I reckoned you’d
want to get fresh horses in
today so’s the boys could have
a weekend in Dilargo.”
I looked at the boys, and I
didn’t have to study their faces
closely to see that a weekend in
Dilargo ran a very poor second
to the entertainment they had
been counting on. Even Duffy,
without catching the actual
reason, knew his hopes had been
shattered.
“Wash these things up and
chuck the gear into the tilly,” I
said. “And cheer up. There’s
nothing to stop us coming back
once we get the bullocks off.”
CHAPTER X
"IX/E mustered the bullock-
W paddock in two days and
the only real trouble came when
Carson saw the final tally. He
had promised the buyer six-
hundred-head, the pick of six-
fifty, but when we finished draft-
ing I made the count of bullocks
in hand only five-hundred-and-
seventy-three. We had also
yarded over sixty-head of cows,
weaners and strangers, none of
which should have been in the
bullock-paddock.
Carson was sitting on the top
rail of the drafting-yard when I
passed him up the tally-card, and
for a while I thought he was
going to have a stroke. He said
the tally was wrong, said we
hadn’t mustered the paddock
properly, and called Heaven to
witness that never in the history
of Queensland had a man been
expected to put up with so much
incompetence.
It was a hot day, and his color
deepened from red to purple,
his heavy jowls quivered and he
looked like an enraged old
turkey-gobbler. According to his
books he had put over seven-
hundred-head of bullocks in that
paddock. A few might have
got out; a dozen-head at the
most. And here was I trying to
put him off with less than six-
hundred !
“The rest of them are still in
the paddock,” he declared, jump-
ing to the ground and aiming a
savage kick at the nearest post.
“I’ll get on a blasted horse and
go down there and find them
myself.”
“Yes, do,” I answered. “I’ll
come with you. It’ll be a treat to
see you getting ’em out of
hollow-logs, because that’s the
only place we haven’t searched.”
“Bah! I’ve never heard a man
talk so much drivel as you do.”
He swung another kick at the
post. This time he connected,
and judging from his antics he
hurt his toes rather badly. When
he had finished' hopping about,
he said with the peevish tone
creeping into his voice: “I
dunno. Damned if I do. If they
aren’t in the paddock, where are
they?”
“Out bush.”
I was beginning to know
Carson now In the first flush of
his rages it was useless to say
anything, but once that peevish
aggrieved note crept in you
could reason with him. “You
ought to know that. You saw
enough of them when you went
through that last muster. There’s
bullocks everywhere out there.
What else can you expect with
the fences all down?”
“I know, I know.” He
shrugged his big shoulders irrit-
ably and limped to the shade of
a bottle-tree. “Blast that infernal
post! I think I’ve broken me big
toe ... No need to keep harping
on about the fences; they’re
being fixed now. But I dunno
what I’m going to tell this buyer
tomorrow. He’s a hard ijmn to
get on with. When he says six-
hundred-and-fifty-head he means
sjx-hundred-and-fifty.”
“Tell him the others got out
through a break in the fence,” I
suggested. “It’s the only thing
you can tell him.”
He looked at me with a sort of
pitying contempt.
“Don’t be so bloody childish,
Bob,” he said. “I told him that
last year.”
'T'HE buyer came out by car
early next morning. We
were holding the bullocks on
camp, and Carson was waiting
up at the house with two horses.
He and the buyer were chatting
amiably when they joined us, so
amiably that I wondered
whether Carson had said any-
thing about the numbers. Much
to my surprise he introduced me
to Rustin, the buyer, as “my
new overseer and a first-class
man with cattle.”
Rustin stretched over his
horse’s neck and shook my hand
warmly.
“Knew your dad,” he said.
“If you take after him you’ll do.”
He was a small man, lean and
wiry, with a lined face and alert
eyes that darted restlessly from
point to point, never missing a
thing. They flickered over me,
those eyes, assessing everything
from my hat to my spurs, and
when he swung his horse away to
ride into the mob I felt he even
knew there was a button missing
from the pocket of my shirt.
And how that man knew
cattle! He rode quietly through
the mob, his festless eyes taking
in every poor-doer, every thick
horn that betrayed a trace of
stag, every small blemish.
His inspection completed, he
rode over to Carson, and I heard
him say, “Your price is too high
for me, Carson. Come down
five-bob and I’ll take ’em. Five-
hundred, the pick of this mob on
the camp. You know me. No
haggling. That’s my offer. Take
it or leave it.”
I liked him for that. So many
buyers took the quoted price as
a basis for prolonged haggling.
They rambled on about the poor
quality of the cattle, the pos-
sibilities of a drought or the fall-
ing market —anything to instil a
sense of inferiority in the mind
of a seller and so induce him to
drop his price.
This man did none of those
things. He knew what he wanted,
what he was prepared to pay,
and he was not a believer in
bluffing. Carson must have
known this, because, after a bit
of grumbling, he accepted.
“Will we put them in the
yard?” he asked. “Or will you
draft them here?”
“I’ll draft them here.” Rustin
beckoned me over, “You’re
younger than we are,” he said.
“Come into the mob with me.
I’ll point ’em out to you, and you
can run ’em off.”
No true horseman can resist
the fascination of camp-drafting,
especially when he is riding a
good camp-horse. The perfect
understanding between horse
and rider, the keen intelligence
of the horse and the bullock’s
struggles to outwit the combina-
tion make it more of a sport than
a job of work.
I was riding a good camp-
horse, a compact little black
gelding named Diver. like most
of the Yakaparni horses he
needed practice, because Carson
had only drafted on the camp
when the cutting-out of cows
and calves made it necessary.
Diver got plenty of practice
that morning. The bullocks were
restless, and our united efforts
could not keep them from mill-
ing. They were not used to being
worked on camp, their constant
churning made the job of
cutting-out difficult, and their
efforts to leave the camp singly
or as a mob soon had the horses
sweating freely.
Carson, assisting the boys on
the face of the camp, was getting
more irritable every minute.
“Why don’t you put them in
the yard?” he asked Rustin.
“You’d get the job done in half
the time.” ,
“I don’t doubt it, Carson.”
The buyer also sounded irritable
“But we’re going to do it here.
I’ve got to take these bullocks
down to New South Wales and
fatten them. They’ll be worked
on camps when I get ’em home,
and they might as well start
learning now.”
Carson shrugged his big
shoulders impatiently, and said,
“Have it your own way. But
it’s a waste of good time. You’ll
be all day getting them drafted
this way.” ,
“I don’t doubt that, either,
Rustin snapped. “Unless they
settje-down we’re liable to be
here till dark.” He grinned then,
and ran his hand with a caressing
motion along his horse’s neck.
“Look, Carson, I’ll let you into a
secret. I like quiet cattle. Call
it a fad if you like, but I’m will-
ing to pay for it. There’s nothing

CHATEAU TANUNDA
(Clipper Ships No. 3)
itkdi ■ ’ 1
!V,
A Handsome Clipper
In the early 1850’s, when British families flocked
to Australia to share in the gold boom and ex-
tend the frontiers of settlement, the ships that
carried them \Vere among the finest vessels
afloat —the splendid Clippers, “ocean queens of
the era of sail.”
r Of those flyers, pre-eminent in the Australian trade,
one of the favourites was the "Red Jacket.” A 2,008-
odd tonner, designed by the celebrated Samuel Pook
of Boston, she was the best of three American-built
r Clippers acquired by Britain's White Star Line to
wrest patronage from its great rival, the Black Ball Line,
whose Clippers, including the pioneer “Marco Polo”
were making maritime history.
t The “Red Jacket” reached Liverpool in March, 1854,
some two months after her launching. She was out-
standingly handsome with delicate lines, yet ruggedly
timbered and sparred. Her proud figurehead repre-
sented a Seneca Indian Chief whose name she bore.
Commanded by Captain Samuel Reid, the “Red
Jacket" sailed on her maiden voyage to Australia on
May 4of the same year. Her passengers were mostly
well-to-do emigrants who had paid up to 60 guineas
for their berths, and their choice proved a happy one
for the Clipper reached Melbourne in the spanking
time of 69 days. Returning Home round Cape Horn
with 45,000 ounces of Australian gold, she made
passage in 78 days.
Clipper ships had short lives as crack liners; the
best of them became strained, with water-soaked hulls,
after a few years. But the “Red Jacket’s” gallant
career was exceptionally long. In competition with
the greatest of her rivals—the famous Black Bailer,
“Lightning,” which was the second subject of this
series—she made many excellent passages. She con-
tinued regularly in the Australian trade until 1869
after which she was sold to Canadian lumber shippers
and ended her days in the 80's as a humble coal hulk.

wrong with the quality of your
bullocks. I’d have paid your
price, another five-bob-a-head, if
they’d been what I call well-
handled. I’ve got to fatten ’em,
and I’ve just got a conviction
that touchy cattle won’t fatten.”
His quick grin came on again,
“Now, what say we get one of
the boys to boil the quartpots
and give the mob a chance to
settle-down?”
I could not help thinking what
a sensible suggestion it was, but
Carson said, “If you won’t put
’em in the yard you might as well
waste the time boiling quartpots.
You won’t rtfeed me here for that,
so I’ll go off and get some work
done.” '
He wheeled his horse and rode'
away, disapproval shoeing in his
rigid back.
I called Wonga over, gave
him the tea and sugar from my
saddle-pouch and told him to
collect the quartpots. He rode
off without a word, but on his
way down to the water with his
collection of quartpots he jerked
his head towards his three mates
still frantically turning the strays
in.
“Like tryin’ to ’old a mob of
bees in y’r hat, ain’t it?” he
remarked. “Squeeze it up in one
place and they fly out another.”
Rustin only grinned. Another
man might have taken the cue
and held forth about how badly
worked the cattle were. But not
Rustin. He had already
expressed his opinions to Carson,
and he had no intention of run-
ning down his methods behind
his back.
r T'HE bullocks were easier to
work when we resumed
drafting. They were still far
from good, but at least I could
work one to the face of the
camp without having it swept
aside by a tightly-packed,
thrusting mob.
Diver worked like a perfect
camp-horse, knowing instinc-
tively which beast was to be cut-
out as soon as I moved him
towards it. There were times
when I felt he must even have
understood Rustin when he said,
“Out that staggy-looking bloke,”
or, “Take that yellow slab-sided
thing next.”
Once I got a bullock clear of
the mob Dulfy took-over,
swooping in behind it with a
swinging grace of movement,
matching his pace with the
bullock’s, and never giving it a
chance to turn back.
“Prettiest horseman I ever
saw,” Rustin remarked once. “If
you ever feel you can do without
him send him down to me.”
“You’ll be waiting a long
time,” I told him.
We finished drafting and had
the culls turned-out by lunch-
time. The bullocks would stay
in the small holding-paddock
until the drovers arrived.
“They should be here
tomorrow night with four-
hundred-head I bought from
Allcot,” Rustin said, as we rode
up to the house.
The Carsons were waiting for
us on the cool veranda, Mrs.
Carson quietly welcoming, her
husband fidgety and obviously
hungry.
Carson’s hunger was always
obvious. If his wife delayed a
meal while she welcomed a guest
he had a habit of moving rest-
lessly about, tugging at his
moustache and glancing long-
ingly at the dining-room door.
If that failed, he began tighten-
ing his belt, and perhaps heav-
ing a small sigh or two. The
next stage was the irritable one,
when he began chewing his
moustache and growing steadily
redder in the face.
Usually Mrs. Carson led the
way into the dining-room at this
stage, fully aware that if she
delayed much longer the old
fellow would ask plaintively, “Is
there any reason why we can’t
eat? Or do you want a man to
collapse of hunger on his own
doorstep?”
We got Rustin seated one
jump ahead of the question, and
we three conversed while Carson
concentrated on the serious busi-
ness of eating. Once Rustin
distracted his attention by offer-
ing him the sauce.
“Sauce! ” Carson looked up in
assumed surprise. “The meat’s
not bad, is it?”
He took up the carving-fork,
lifted the big piece of corned-
brisket from the meat-dish and
sniffed it vigorously.
“Smells all right to me,” he
announced. “Perfectly sweet.”
It was his specialised act, his
way of intimating that sauce was
only necessary to disguise the
taste when the beef had gone
rancid in the cask. Never, when
a visitor offered the sauce, did
he miss the opportunity of thus
expressing his disapproval of
the habit of spoiling the flavor
of good beef.
When we were getting towards
the bottom of a cask he had
two classifications—“strong” and
“going off a bit.” The former
was a term of approval. “Strong”
beef had a bit of flavor ; it stuck
to you when you had heavy
work to do. To the rest of us
the beef that came under this
heading was sour and unpalat-
able.
When he described it as
“going off a bit” it was down-
right bad. Its smell preceded it
as he carried it from the cask
to the kitchen. To his wife’s
occasional suggestions that he
should throw it out his answer
was always, “What, waste good
beef? There’s nothing wrong
with that piece. All it needs is
a bit of sauce.”
~D USTIN drove off after lunch,
and I made myself a promise
that if I was still on Yakaparni
next year I would test his state-
ment that well-handled bullocks
were worth an extra five-shillings
a head to him.
Carson seemed well pleased
with his deal. He lay back in
his canvas chair after dinner that
evening, rambling on about how
nice it was to get the bullocks
off before Christmas, especially
with the grass drying-off the way
it was. Of course we might gQt
storms any day now. And then
again we might not. His teeth
clattered as he shifted them with
his tongue, and he heaved a sigh
of content. Old Forster would
be pleased when he saw the
cheque for the bullocks, though
he’d quite likely say it should
have been bigger. Damned old
vulture! Wonder if he was still
going-on about his gastric-ulcer?
Carson gave a groan. What
the devil would Forster know
about the agonies of gastric-
ulcers? In case we had missed
the point, he groaned again, a
little louder.
“You don’t think you’ve eaten
too much dinner, do you,
Joseph?” Mrs. Carson sug-
gested mildly.
I was sure he had, and equally
sure he would react.
“Don’t talk such blasted rot,
Peg!” he snapped. “I ate a
normal meal. Do you expect
a man to starve himself to
death?”
Two minutes later he was
happily discussing the delivery of
the bullocks. We agreed that I
should take all the boys and give
the drovers a hand for the first
day. After that, Carson sup-
posed, we might as well pay
them off till after Christmas.
“I’d like to keep them on for
another week,” I said. “I want
to go back to the Brigalow Yards
and spend a week poking about
in those scrubs. I’ve got an idea
there are a lot of cattle in there
that never come out in the
open.”
That stirred up his gastric-
ulcer with a vengeance. He
declared that never in his life
had he heard of such a ridicul-
ous waste of time and money.
“What if there are a few head
in there?” he demanded.
“There’s no permanent water in
the scrubs and they’ve got to
come out in a dry time. For
God’s sake, Bob, talk sense. How
do you think you could get ’em
out? Cripple all the blasted
horses and come out with noth-
ing to show for it; that’s all
you’d do, I’m not paying men
for that nonsense.”
He went on in that strain for
so long that in the end I -got
fed-up and said, “Have it your
own way. If you want to breed
scrubbers and have the place
overrun with cleanskins and
scrub bulls f suppose that’s your
affair. I’m going to bed.”
CHAPTER XI
THE drovers arrived late the
following afternoon and
we yarded first our bullocks and
then theirs. By the time we had
split them up into different yards
and put the rails up it was dark.
Charlie Rake, the boss-drover,
would count the Yakaparni
bullocks with me in the morning
and officially take over.
We parted at the rails, Old
Charlie to ride off with his men
to unsaddle and hobble-out
their horses by the campfire down
on the creek, while we returned
to the house. ■
“Drop down for a yarn after
supper if you feel like it,” he
called as he rode away.
“You cornin’ down, boss?”
Mick asked.
“No,” I said. “I don’t think
I’ll bother.”' I glanced at the
distant campfire and added, “I’ll
bet there’ll be some horrible lies
told down on the creek flat
tonight.”
“Too right,” Wonga agreed.
“And I’ll be right up among
the leaders.” (
We all laughed. As a yarn-
spinner and bush-liar Wonga
had no equal. He could tell the
most outrageous lies without a
flicker of a smile, and his fund
of them seemed inexhaustible. I
suspected he made them up as
he went along.
That evening Carson talked
about the influence of the wind
on thunderstorms. At least I
think that was what he was
talking about, for I was not
paying much attention to him.
I was listening to the musical
clanking of distant horse-bells, a
sound I hadn’t heard for years.
And the sound brought back
memories of mustering-camps in
the Gulf-country and droving-
camps on the long trip to the
South.
It's a funny thing about horse-
bells ; pick a couple up and
shake them and the result is a
discordant clatter. But listen to
the same two bells on horses
feeding far off in the night and
you hear music. Maybe it’s the
distance, or the fact that the
sound is in keeping with the soft
stillness of the night.
Whatever the cause, it is a
soothing sound, memory-invok-
ing and conducive to yarn-
spinning. I listened to it for
a while, excused myself in one
of Carson’s pauses, and sneaked
away to the camp.
In spite of the warmness of
the night Rake’s men had a big
fire going. It lent its reddish
glow to the white trunk of a big
blucgum and flickered softly
among the high branches.
Black silhouettes of squatting
men showed up against it as I
approached, and standing erect,
seeming to rise from the flames
themselves, was the brightly
illuminated figure of old Charlie
Rake.
“You’re just in time,” he
greeted me. “She’s aboilin .” He
tossed a handful of tea into the
billy and lifted it off with his
hat. “Take a seat over there on
the pack-bags. I’ll be with you
as soon as I get a couple of
pannikins.”
They were all grouped around
the fire, I noted, Charlie’s men
and mine. Duffy was in his
usual position, close to Wonga.
He might only catch odd scraps
of the general conversation, but
once Wonga had the floor he
would be in a box-seat.
No one had the floor at the
moment, we were sipping the
scudding teu. snd st&ring into
the flames. Away in the distance
the horse-bells tinkled faintly,
Presently a big deep-toned
Condamine-bell rang out and
clattered like a fire-alarm as a
horse shook himself.
“Shouldn’t ’ave no trouble
findin’ him in the morning,”
Mick ventured. _
Always shove the Conda-
mine on the itchiest moke in
the mob,” one of Charlie’s men
said. “No trouble findin’ ’em
before daylight then.”
“It don’t always work out that
way,” Wonga told him. “A
’orse stays awake all night
scratchin’ himself, and by the
time daylight starts to show he s

known for sure where or when the
story of the Dog on the Tuckerbox
began. In “How Many Miles from
Gundagai?” (B. 18/4/’56), discussing
this question, John Meredith and
Patricia Francis said “There exists an
account of an old-time stock-drover
who was accustomed to camp in that
vicinity [of Five Mile Creek]; when
compelled to leave camp for any
reason he would call his dog, point
to the tuckerbox and say ‘Guard!’
The dog would immediately climb on
the box, and no persuasion would
induce it to climb down until the
return of its master.” They pointed
out also that it is at Five Mile Creek
that the marble monument of the
Dog on the Tuckerbox is erected, and
that the refrain “And the dog sat on
the tuckerbox Fjye miles from
Gundagai” occurs in a recitation
dated 1859. Jack Moses is usually
credited with changing the distance,
but before he wrote there was
already a poem in existence (sung to
the traditional air of “Camooweal
Races”) which had the dog sitting “in
the tuckerbox” nine miles from
Gundagai.

(1) Brief outline of the career of
Laurence Short, of the Ironworkers’
Federation ? (2) Was he ever a Com-
munist ?
(1) Now aged 40, he joined the
Ironworkers’ Federation in 1937, and
in 1944 unsuccessfully opposed Com-
munist Ernest Thornton for the office
of national secretary of the federation.
With Thornton realising that Short
represented a threat to his position in
the union, the struggle between the
two men grew, and in 1946 Thornton
had Short expelled; but he was
reinstated by the A.C.T.U. in 1947.
He was threatened and assaulted, and,
when Thornton accused him of
fabricating a story of a bashing, sued
him for libel and won. He again
stood against Thornton in 1949 and
was defeated, but went to court and,
in a case lasting 16 months, was
declared the properly elected secretary,
and installed in office. In Dec.,
1952, Short and his fellow-A.L.P.
candidates won every position in the
union, and thus the Communist grip
on the union was broken. In Jan.,
1954, selected as an “outstanding
foreigner” under the Smith-Mundt
Act, Short went to the U.S.A. to
study conditions there as guest of the
U.S. Government. (2) When 14 he
joined the Young Communist League,
but was expelled two years later.

Some information on the Bay Line
of ships ? Are any still in commis-
sion ?
The five “Bay” ships of the Com-
monwealth Line were the Moreton
Bay (13,855 tons, built by Vickers,
Ltd., Barrow, 1921), which is still in
commission but due for withdrawal
early in 1957; Largs Bay (13,851 tons,
built by W. Beardmore and Co.,
Glasgow, 1921), still in commission
but also due for withdrawal early in
1957; Hobsons Bay (13,837 tons,
built by Vickers, 1922), broken-up in
1955 and the name transferred to the
Esperance Bay; Esperance Bay
(13,851 tons, built by -Beardmore,
1922), also broken-up in 1955—after
being twice renamed, Hobsons Bay
and then Arawa; Jervis Bay (13,837
tons, built by Vickers, 1922), sunk, as
H.M.S. Jervjs Bay, in the famed
North Atlantic action during World
War 11. At the end of 1927 these
five ships, together with cargo-ships
Ferndale and Fordsdale, each of
12,000 tons, were advertised for sale
by tender, and in April, 1928, the
tender of the White Star Co. was
accepted. Subsequently they were
taken over by Shaw, Savill and Albion
Co., Ltd., and later passed to the
Aberdeen and Commonwealth Line.
The “Bay” ships traded between
Great Britain and Australia as one-
class passenger-ships. 1
Brief Answers
M.L.: Such an increase in the
interest-rate on mortgages already in
existence is legitimate, and established
procedure C .T.P.: Thanks for
your offer to forward the words of
Gene Fowler’s poem “The Jervis Bay
Goes Down,” but the words of the
poem*asked for (though the “Brief
Answer” could perhaps be read as
referring back to the Jervis Bay) were
those of an early Australian ballad
only one stanza of which was known
to the inquirer W.W.: The engine
used by John Dickson which began
operation on May 29, 1815 (mentioned
in an advt., B. 23/5/’56), was not for
use in a sawmill but in a flourmill (as
stated). It continued to be so used, and
no indication is given in the records
that it was ever used in the sawmill

THE “BANDITS”
We pull them by the handle, ■ just why is
not too clear;
We know it’s not a gamble, like alcohol
in beer;
It isn’t for the exercise, the cost would
be too dear;
Nor intellectual stimulus—we don’t admit
we’re queer.
A gamble presupposes the mug has got a
chance,
But, operating “bandits,” we know well
in advance
Each pull deflates our ego, does nothing
to enhance
Our estimate of homo. We lead ourselves
a dance.
Like babes propelled in strollers who play
with dangling toys
The only thing that’s needed to fascinat*
us boys
Is something of like nature: the moron’s
heavenly joys
Are bowls and beer and “bandits”—the
last’s what Bung annoys.

dim.
And yet he would reform us and curb
our wicked ways
(Of course he doesn’t mind if the profit

His one and only object is that we end

Or So They Soy...
“Gone South for Good!”
By JACK LUSBY
ITS glaring hot on the palm-
fringed strip; and the old-
timer turns in the open
doorway of'the plane for a
final farewell wave. He gets a
great send-off burst of cheers
from the white-clad group on
the ground, and is gone.
“Where’s Joe off to this time?”
somebody asks, and#there’s a
lot of good-natured laughter,
“Going South for Good again?”
It’s a tenner to a toothache
that in half-a-year or so Joe
will be shaking hands all round
as his gear’s dumped on the
same spot. The Islands arc
dotted from one end to the other
with men who’ve “Gone South
for Good.”
What’s the strength of it?
Ever since the wandering
members of the earth’s bleached
minority first sweated and
cursed under the heat and dis-
comforts of the Equator the
white bloke’s been coming back
for more. A good many,
famous and infamous, make
their first visit last a lifetime. The
set-up has been commercialised,
publicised, joke-blocked, lam-
pooned and Hollywoodened;
but its curiosity-value stays
fresh.
Boswell records plying Cook
with questions about the strange
South Seas back in the 1770’5.
Unlike Johnson, Boswell was
much intrigued. From Cook’s
replies he probably learned
pretty well as much as is con-
veyed in today’s lush travel-ads.,
and not much less than today’s
air-speeds allow globe-flitters to
soak in.
The real feel of the tropics
takes a while to get under the
skin. War-time conditions make
most blokes pretty well immune.
Then we take too much of our
own air with us. Hate, fear,
haste and tension repel the slow
bug that bites and brings-’em-
back.
Tire ones it does bite the
colorful characters of the
Islands —are still there. The
region shapes ’em —all different,
but with a family likeness. The
Aussies are not quite like
Aussies, the Americans not quite
Americans, and a new glint
shows through the old patina on
men more directly come from
Europe.
They all. toe the equatorial
line and pretty soon wear the
same stamp. It’s then they
belong for ever, and breakaways
may at any time be pulled back.
“If ever I strike it rich up
here, mate, I’ll get out,” you
hear ’em say sometimes. “Get
set in something cushy where
there’s a bit of bloody comfort! ”
The Yank airs a yen for New
York. The Scot’s brogue
broadens as he pokes a bony
finger into your shirt. and gets
sentimental about something
they sell in Scotland that’s nae
the same oot here. The Aus-
tralian reflects with regret on a
sheila who owned a flat with a
view lookin’ right over Rand-
wick. The long, thin English-
man shrugs-off hjs far-away
look. The Irishman suddenly
bangs a reddened hould-y’r-
wfiisht fist on the table and
bursts into song.
All bull! Try and send any of
them home for good!
1 spent a week or two with
a noted gold-hunter and recruiter
from the Sepik. He was born in
New Zealand’s South Island ;
his only excursions from New'
Guinea have been during a
couple of world wars.
Know another man who dug
up enough quick gold to tear
off hell-bent to have a look at
all the countries in the world.
He did see most of them. And
came straight back to the old
pitch. You couldn’t shift him.
Met an assistant-district-
officer who won first-prize in a
formidable lottery. Last seen
earbashing his beloved kanakas.
There are grizzled missionaries
who’ve been out in the Islands
so long they have real difficulty
in remembering just when they
“left home.” Their real home
is the savage jungle where the
drums beat, and the lonely coral
beaches where, the only sounds
are the thunder of surf and sigh
of the “trades” overhead.
When it’s learned in colder
and more cluttered parts that
somebody’s - “gone to the
Islands” it’s fashionable to shrug,
hook up an eyebrow, and ask
“What’s he running away
from?”
Could be, occasionally, from
shruggers and eyebrow-hookers.
Not many men up there can put
a precise finger on what brought
them there in the first place.
And few bother to rationalise.
“Just interested in the thing,”
one district-commissioner told
me.
“Letter from a cobber up
here,” said another —a common
reason, this.
“Gold,” say the goldminers;
but they stick after the gold
cuts-out.
“Job,” say die pilots; but
there are easier nying jobs back
home, and a lot of these flying
blokes get their families up
there and look around, for
plantation land to settle on when
their flying is behind them.
Being beyond the reach of
income-tax would seem suffi-
cient reason in itself for most
of us. Anyway, whatever it is
gets men to the Islands, it’s the
Islands that keep them there, as
all stayputs admit readily. When
the original job cuts-out, plant-
ing and trading do for an
anchor.
“Yeah, the Big Smoke’s pretty
sweet for a coupla moons,’’ one
returnee told me the day he
lobbed back at Madang, “but she
soon starts getting you down.
They’re all racing around down
there getting nowhere. Every-
one’s got someone on his
hammer. A man’d go bloody
troppo, stickin’ it out
there.”
As the Islands served to refit
and provision the old sailors,
so they’ve mentally and bodily
refitted painters and writers,
who’ve repaid with a wealth of
their own tribute. They enriched
the work of R. L. Stevenson,
Gauguin, Maugham, Jack Lon-
don, to pick a name or two at
random.
But when New Guinea native
leaders jaunted down to Aus-
tralia a while back to have a
look at the white master at home
and to meet his Queen they
compared the truly wondrous
luxuries on tap with the limited
amenities available to Master
Archie in New Guinea; and
they wondered hard why he
sticks around the Equator.
“He must be here on philan-
thropical grounds,” was the
trend of their homecoming
discourse, “or he’d be crazy to
leave home!”
There are many times when
the blokes of the pith-hatted
persuasion are damned certain
they were crazy to leave home.
When the squall r smitten
schooner seems an odds-on
moral to rip her guts out on
the reef; when rain Niagaras
all night on an open, icy,
mountain camp; when the
plane twists frantically, fanning
the jungle-top, caught among
cloud-swept crags; when the
“natives are unfriendly” ; when
alone with toothache and out
of smokes of tormented by fever
and tropical sores; when
panther-pacing round the donga
with accumulated boredom tear-
ing pin-up girls off the rattan
wall, or simply because once
again there’s no mail
And yet, there you’ll find 'em
—on the long, lonely patrols, in
schooners, luggers and canoes,
in rattling jeeps and noise-
battered cockpits, at the mis-
sions and plantations, among the
doctors, bug-hunters and anthro-
pologists, in the trade-stores,
and drinking Rhum Negrita on
the club verandas . . . the blokes
who’ve Gone South for Good!
“Q. Ree”: In old Fiji, illicit
intercourse between the sexes
was a capital crime, the offenders
being clubbed to death. Village
laws are still strict, but moral
laxity is now characteristic of
Fijians in industrial centres.
They “tiko vaka Suva” —“stay
as they do in Suva.” My first
house-girl was 22, single, and
had two children, one five and
the other six years old, which
was starting young even for
Fijians. When she told me her
boy-friend (not the father of
her children) was living with
her, I was as “broadminded” as
though we were living in Sydney ;
but when her parents visited her,
I expected her to * remove
evidence of his residence. But
no. He joined the family group.
They generally remain faithful
until an angry wife, change of
job, or other circumstance
breaks them up. Then a new
boy-friend is installed. The
abnormally high percentage of
illegitimate children among
Fijians are no social embarrass-
ment. If the girls work, often
their mothers or other relatives
care for the children in the
villages. Even so, abortion is
common. The Fijians are a very
likeable, good-natured people,
and one wonders how much their
easygoing love-making is respon-
sible for their good-nature. #

“Daika” (Papua): The re-
ported outbreak of “cargo cult”
west of Port Moresby recalls
one in the D’Entrecasteaux
Archipelago about two years
ago. They all follow much the
same lines: the building of a
house ; the wait for a boat to
stock it with goods. Sometimes
the natives throw away, or eat,
all their seed-yams and destroy
various articles in the belief that
more will soon arrive. There is
always some leader who fosters
the belief. In the earlier case
the tribes gathered in hundreds
on the day appointed for .the
arrival of the cargo. The only
boat to arrive was a trawler
carrying the patrol-officer, who
viewed the gathering with a
jaundiced eye. Inquiries revealed
that the leader had received his
information from a large post
sunk in the ground near the
beach. Only he could hear it
answer him, buj the patrol-
officer insisted that he also might
be able to hear it, and led the
way. This must have unnerved
the high-priest a bit, for, on
standing close to the post and
giving several nervous swallows,
all he could say was, “Oh, post,
I so sorry” ; then he relapsed
into silence. It broke the tension,
&nd the roars of laughter which
followed restored sanity and
ended the chance of further
spreading of the cult under that
particular man. It was, however,
months before village - life
became normal. When last seen
the high-priest was energetically
making a new garden.

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Two richly-endowed events to
be run next Saturday will be
the last important races of the
current Turf season, ending
July 31 —the Doomben £lO,OOO
Cup at Brisbane and the
historic £3500 Grand National
Steeplechase at Flemington.
The class to run over the 11
furlongs less 22yds. of the
Doomben Cup is particularly
good. Acceptances include
horses owned in most Australian
States and in New Zealand.
Doomben Cup selections:
Cambridge, 1 ; Landy, 2;
Decisive, 3.
Best of the Brisbane horses
in the Cup should be Regal
Dignity, who recorded a solid
Cup-trial when he won the
Carnival Handicap (H mile) on
Saturday. He carried 7.9 and
drops lib: in 4he Cup. He’s a
winner of the Queensland Derby.
Too much notice should not be
taken of Fire Dust’s failure in
the Carnival Handicap: he drops
to 7.3 in the Cup—a luxury
impost for a winner of the
Doncaster with 7.10.
Persian Link had a runaway
win in the Cup last year, defeat-
ing Hutton and Clever Beau in
2.13*, equalling the race-record
held by Dark Marne and Rio
Fe. Usually the event is thus
won by a visiting horse, others
in recent years taken to Bris-
bane specially for the Cup
having included Euphrates,
French Echo, Tossing, Rio Fe,
Dark Marne and Beaulivre.
Bernborough’s win with 10.11 in
1946 was a notable Cup
triumph.
Sydney jockeys N. Sellwood
(El Khobar, 10 to 1), J. O’Sulli-
van (Criollo, 10 to 1) and J.
Thompson (Teranyan, 20 to 1)
filled the places in the Doomben
Ten Thousand, the £5OO for
fourth going to the 13-to-2
favorite from Adelaide, Copper
Year. Winner’s share was
£7OOO.
The Ten Thousand was the
most open race of its type for
many years. Sellwood had the
choice of five mounts ; his selec-
tion of El Khobar was clever
picking and deserved success.
Teranyan didn’t arrive at the
course until six hours before
the race started, due to an
alteration in the plane’s schedule.
To finish third in the circum-
stances was an excellent effort.
Wide barrier-positions did
not affect El Khobar (20) or
Teranyan (22); indeed, in recent
seasons other horses considered
unfavorably placed at the barrier
have won this event. A 1300-
guineas purchase, El Khobar is
a three-year-old bay colt by
Gabador (imp.) from Gay
Abandon by Theio (imp.) from
Silver Bream by Silverado
(imp.). His best winning rela-
tives have been stayers:
Argentic (14 firsts), Saint
Warden (also 14 wins, including
the Caulfield Cup and the Port
Adelaide Cup) and Starland (12
firsts, including the two-miles
Auckland Cup).
Bold Flare, withdrawn from
the Kensington Steeple on Satur-
day because of the heavy going,
was reckoned by his trainer to
have been seasoned 'enough,
without the extra race, for the
National Steeple next Saturday.
He is at the peak of his form ;
he has won at almost all his
starts, on the flat and over fences,
and this year he is likely to go
just the shade better- than last
year, when he was beaten in the
last stride, a green jumper at
50 to 1.
Teedum won the Kensington
at the right end, despite his 11.10.
Alec Fullarton, as might be
expected, has got him back to
his best as the big Steeple day
arrives, and he seems sure to be
placed in the G.N. A lot of use
was made of Allard in the Ken-
sington, and he faded. Allard is
a splendid Flemington horse, and
the only jumper to have beaten
Bold Flare this season. He is
hard to train, but if he gets to
the post, he has an outside show.
The stable thought Redfield
had improved a ton in the week
since his Federal Hurdle seventh,
so he was the best-backed course-
runner in the National Hurdle
to beat Kingsmore, the hot
favorite. Brian Smith, who rode
Redfield, brought him home on
the rails, and he beat Eager Son
and Blue Vest by two lengths ;
but Smith would have won on
either of the placed horses, too,
no doubt. Anyway, he won the
three jumping races at Flem-
ington. He knows all about <
getting a horse over them, and
makes one, and one only, run,
often decisive.
Redfield, bred in 1948 by M. P.
Reid, of South Australia, is an
Enfield (imp.) product, from
Sequoia by Heroic from Des-
demona by All Black (imp.).
Enfield’s many winners include
the two Melbourne Cup victors
Rimfire and Sirius, and Adelaide
Cup winner Aldershot. The
English stayer’s progeny have
won upwards of £235,000 in
stakes.
A jockey must be as fit as his
mount, and certainly Brian
Smith must be in great physical
nick. At Flemington he rode
over an aggregate distance- of
seven miles and half, a furlong,
with 26 hurdles and 18 fences to
make the three winning journeys
interesting. He became the third
jockey to pilot a winning jump-
ing treble at Flemington. No
other than poet Adam Lindsay
Gordon rode three steeple
winners there in October, 1868,
and Tommy Corrigan was on
three jumping winners at the
same address in July, 1881.
Tricky Lad improved on two
seconds in a row to start second-
favorite and win the Flemington
opening event, the Two-year-old
Mile, in good style. The colt
comes from an old family-line;
he goes back to Barcaldine on
the dam’s side. He’s another of
the successful Comic Court
progeny; his dam, Twinkle
Star, was got by Dhoti (imp.)
from Tourmente by Drake
(imp.) from Tordilla by Lanius
(imp.). The colt has the Carbine
blood in his make-up, and could

boomed New Zealander, Watch

8.13 on the heavy track too
much of a task.

Ray George, who is apprenticed
to Rosehill trainer M. F. Ander-
son, displaying fine form in
landing his three winners,
Warren Stream, Royal Greetings

successful on Prince Jambo and
J. Angus on Finisterre. George’s
handling of Royal Greetings
was particularly good. On
Lord Cynara he had to work
hard to beat another up-and-

Faith la the
Future
Many times when I have been abroad, or
talking to visitors here in Australia, I have heard
it remarked how very much in talent has come
from our small population.
It shows particularly in sport, where
competition lights up its own comparisons. But it
is to be found also in‘other branches of life.
Australia has given the wdrld some first-rate
talents in several fields. Medicine, science, aviation,
the concert platform are ones that comp readily to
mind.
That is worth recalling now, when we must
draw upon everything we have in resources —
intellectual as well as material —to make the best
job of building Aus^alia.
Our country, by its size and richness and its
systems devised for industrial and social better-
ment, is, to my observation, as kind to its people
as any in the world.
While appreciating all that, I think we should
be careful lest we stifle ambition and limit the
service our more talented sons and daughters can
give. The aim, I believe, should be to level up
rather than level down.
The search for talent is intensifying overseas.
Britain has made the fostering of special abilities
an essential part of her drive back to commercial
, and industrial strength. In America —as I saw
at first-hand last year —one of the marks of
brilliant management is the extent to which the best
young brains are being sought out and encouraged.
Australia can afford to do no less with her
fund of fresh and able minds.
The initiative rests not only with those in
authority. It comes down to the young people
themselves. They are the ones who have the future
in their hands, and to them I would say:
• “Be not shy with your talents. Show them,
use them; remembering that talent has a currency
all its own—and that it is something for which
there is no substitute.”

face and deepened the worried
lines of his forehead.
“Talk about flooded rivers,”
he remarked, staring down at the
fire. “You want to be up
Normanton way in the Wet.
We’re bringin’ a mob of Short-
horn bullocks down from there
one wet season, and we come to
a river runnin’ a banker,
There’s me and the boss-drover
and a string of niggers with, the
mob. We’re runnin’ short of
tucker, and it’s no good sittin’
down to wait for the river to
drop. We might’ve been there
till next Cup Day.
“Well, we start pushin*' the
bullocks in, and the boss says
to me, ‘You better stay up along-
side the leaders, Wonga, and
keep ’em goin’ straight. It’s no
good puttin’ any of these boongs
in the lead. I hey re scared as
hell of the ’gators.
“I don’t mind tellin’ you
blokes I’m not too keen on em
meself, but someone s got to
take the lead.”
Wonga paused to search for
the gummy side of a cigarette-
paper. When he found it he
looked solemnly round his audi-
ence.
“Some of youse blokes might
think I’m havin’ a go at you, but
what I’m tellin’ you is gospel-
truth.
“The horse I’m ridin’ is a good
swimmer, and I’ve got the
leaders headed for the far bank,
when there’s a swirl in the
water and me poor bloody ’orse
is dragged right out from under
me, pulled down by a ’gator. I
don’t want to be the next to go,
so I swims over an’ gets astride
the nearest bullock. There’s
hardly time for me to get settled
on him when he’s dragged from
under me.
“ ’Gators! I’ve never seen ’em
so thick. Seems like there’s
more ’gators than bullocks. Five
of them big Shorthorn bullocks
I has dragged from under me,
one after another, before I get
on one that don’t get took. I’m
spurrin’ him along, yellin’ me
head off at the leaders ta get
’em to the bank before we lose
’alf the mob.
“Me and the leaders hit that
bank together and start to
scramble up it. I dunno what
made me wake up to it. It just
sorta come over me that I’m
away down below the 4evel of
the other bullocks. I looks
down, and s’welp me if I’m not
ridin’ a sixteen-foot ’gator.”
In the roar of laughter that
followed Wonga stared around
him with that worried, puzzled
look.
“Laugh if y’ want to,” he* said.
“But you wouldn’t ’ave thought
it was a joke if you’d seen me
leggin’ up that bank, breakin’
evens, and the ’gator only a
coupla feet behind me.”
I looked at the clock when I
got back to the house. It was
half-past two, and we had to
get a daylight start with the
bullocks.
WE let Allcot’s bullocks out
first, and some of the boys
held them while Charlie and I
counted the Yakaparnis out. The
last one scampered through the
gateway, and Charlie closed his
knife.
“That’ll do me for five-
hundred,” he said, glancing at
the scratches he’d made on the
matchbox. “What do you
make it?”
“They’re all there,” I answered.
As Charlie remarked, we had
enough men between us to eat
the bullocks that day. Still, we
saw him to the boundary, and
three miles beyond it for good
measure.
Though I had told them that
Carson had definitely refused to
allow us to go after the
scrubbers, the boys were cheer-
fully optimistic on the way
home.
“Give ’im another go tonight,”
Mick pressed. “You’ll wheel
’im.”
I was not so sure about it.
In fact I felt so doubtful of my
ability to persuade Carson to
change his mind that I would
not even promise to try. Not
only was he a man of very fixed
ideas, but in this case I had a
sneaking feeling his views were
right. Come to think of it, he
was only echoing my own views
when he said scrubber-running
was a waste of time.
I suppose that was why, in-
stead of making a tactful
approach, I said to him when
we got home, “Have you made
the boys’ times up yet?”
He looked at me in a way that
made me feel I would never
understand him.
“I thought you said you
wanted to go back to the Briga-
low Yards fcfr another week,” he
almost moaned. “Why can’t
you make up your mind? And
here I’ve gone to the trouble of
packing half the camp-gear for
an early start in the morning.”
“If you’ve gone - ' to all that
trouble,” I said, struggling to
keep a straight face, “we might
as well go.”
He stumped off muttering
irritably, “I dunno. I dunno.
I’m damned if I do.”
Mick, watching from the
saddle-room door, called, “Did
you wheel ’im, boss?”
“No,” I answered truthfully.
“He wheeled himself.”
TI7E took our best horses out
’ * to the Brigalow Yards next
morning. We also took a
formidable collection of bull-
straps to tie down anything we
threw, though how we were to
induce the thrown beasts into
the yard was a problem I had
yet to work out.
Steve informed me that le had
’put some fishmg-imes in his
swag. It seemed that a good
time was anticipated by all.
, I must admit that I succumbed
to the general infection, without,
however, allowing myself to
feel optimistic about getting the
cattle out of that appalling
scrub. I felt it was my duty to
learn the country thoroughly ana
to form an opinion of the
number of cattle living in the
scrubs. If I did that, the week
would not be wasted.
And during the first three days
I certainly learned a lot about
the country Mick and Wonga
were excellent guides; they
knew, from their possuming ex-
periences, every gully, every
waterhole and every patch of
open plain.
They knew how to skirt the
dense turkey-bush and vine and
arrive at a patch of open
country v£ere cattle might be
feeding. They led us through
acres of pear-infested scrub
where the low pear formed
almost impassable barriers and
the giant tree-pear towered up
amongst the/brigalow, threaten-
ing to choke it out of existence,
There were cattle everywhere.
We saw their tracks, saw where
thev had been eating the pear,
and sometimes we saw the cattle,
though more often we only
heard them crashing through the
undergrowth as they got wind of
our approach. Like an over-
eager hunting-dog, Mick wanted
to chase every sound, and I
found it difficult to curb him.
“When I know where I am
and think there’s a sporting
chance of running ’em out on
to a bit of open country we’ll
give ’em a go,” I told him. “Not
before.”
Wonga was the only one who
agreed with my theory of
patience. Steve and Duffy were
like Mick, anxious to chase any-
thing that moved, regardless of
the country. Their theory was
that wherever wild cattle could
gallop good horsemen could
follow.
“Stick with ’em in the real
thick stuff, and wheel ’em when
it opens out enough to see ’em,”
Mick said. “It’s fruit.”
He was not boasting. When
we ran our first, mob he. cer-
tainly made it look like “fruit.”
We were examining fresh tracks
on a cattle-pad ; knowing that
the pad led to a waterhole on the
edge of a small plain, I said
“We’ll follow these tracks. If
we come up with the mob we’ll
head them for the plain and try
to ring them there. If we get
split-up we’ll meet under the
big bottle-tree.”
We tightened our girths,
emptied our bladders and set
off. I don’t know how much

GROWING SOVIET STRENGTH
A PROPHECY by Dimitri
Manuilsky in 1931, recalled
by Peregrine Worthstone in
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“War to the hilt between Com-
munism and Capitalism is
inevitable. Today, of course,
we [Russia] are not strong
enough to attack. Our time will
come in 20 or 30 years. The
bourgeoisie will have to be put
to sleep, so we will begin by
launching the most spectacular
peace-movement on record.
There will be electrifying over-
tones and unheard-of conces-
sions.. The capitalist countries,
stupid and decadent, will rejoice
to co-operate in their own
destruction. They will leap at
another chance to be friends.
As soon as their guard is down
we shall smash them with our
clenched fist.”
The forecast is of some interest
when considered in the light of
current American Concern about
growing Soviet air-power (men-
tioned here last week), and of the
statement by General Curtis
LeMay (head of the U.S.
Strategic Air Command) that the
Soviet air-power would be effec-
tively superior to that of the
U.S. by 1960.
Analysing, in London
“Encouhter,” “the immense
growth of Soviet military-
industrial power,” two able
American writers on foreign
affairs, Joseph and Stewart Alsop,
recall an incident at the Soviets’
annual air-show last year. As
the Soviets’ new medium-range
and long - range bombers,
Bacjgers and Bisons, passed over-
head the watching Soviet
officials “could not contain their
jubilation” and “the ebullient
Khrushchev literally jumped for
joy, bouncing up and doyvn until
the last bomber was but of
sight.”
“In this oddly schoolboyish
manner,” the Alsops comment,
“the Soviet leaders were cele-
brating the defeat of the United
States in an unseen but deadly
serious race”;
“The race started when the
Soviets made their original
Chinese copy of a strayed
American B-29 that force-landed
in Siberia during the culminat-
ing assault on Japan. The
tremendous American lead was
first overcome. Then, in the vital
category of inter-continental jet-
bombers, the Soviets completed
their Bison prototype in half the
time we [the U.S.] took to
complete the prototype of our
comparable B-52.
“They are now producing
three times as many Bisons as
we are producing B-52’s. They
will also reach their final output-
goal of 20 Bisons per month
considerably sooner than we shall
reach our much lower goal of
17 B-52’s per month. No wonder
Khrushchev jumped for joy.”
Turning over the evidence on
Russia’s developing strength, the
Alsops note that “because the
Russian people are still so much
poorer than the free peoples of
the West, almost all of us tend
to believe that the Soviet Union
must be basically weaker than
the West. Principally for this
reason, even the American and
(British Intelligence forecasters
have been taken by surprise by
every Soviet militafy-industrial
success, from the A-bomb
onwards.
THE ROCKY ROAD OF INTERNATIONAL ROMANCE*
Baltimore (U.S.A.) “Sun"
INTERNATIONAL ELIRTATION
“But, in fact, the Soviet Union
is strong precisely' because the
Russian people are poor.
“In order to see why this
really is the heart of the matter,
it is only necessary to picture the
Soviet Union as a, mammoth
industrial corporation, a gigantic
vertical trust. Th@ trust is
engaged in every kind of primary
and secondary production. It is
wholly self-contained, and even
grows the food to stock its
workers’ commissaries. But its
true end-products are Bisons,
Badgers and other implements
of national power, just as surely
as Buicks and Chevrolets and
Cadillacs are the end-products
of the manifold activities of
General Motors.
“The management of the
Soviet Union, Inc., is both able
and ruthless. The labor-force is
huge, and its sfern discipline
makes strikes unthinkable. The
raw-material resources are very
great indeed. The industrial
plant is also very large. But the
management is unshakably
determined to expand and
develop the industrial plant still
further, until the Soviet Union
towers over every competitor.
And the vast Soviet programme
of industrial expansion and
development is being carried on
under forced draught, with no
dangerous borrowing or stock-
selling to raise new working-
capital, which might give out-
siders a voice in the management.
“Any corporation in this situa-
tion has one easy way to finance
its expansion programme. It
can cut its operating overheads
to the bone, lidding down wages,
skimping on workers 1 housing,
even charging double-prices in
the workers’ commissaries in
order to take a second bite out
of the annual wage-bill. By
these means, although the
workers will suffer, the corpora-
tion can finance its own expan-
sion from its own resources. Up
to a certain point, indeed, the
more the workers are made to
suffer, the .more resources will
be released for investment in
expansion. And this is just about
what the Soviet managers have
been doing.”
After noting a marked but
marginal improvement in the
living-standards of the Russian
people, the Alsops go on to
comment that the Soviets’* gross
national product is broadly
divided into three successive
slices:
“Slice-one of the available
resources goes for capital
improvements, which chiefly
means strengthening the indus-
trial base. Slice-two is directly
invested in military power, mean-
ing all the items includetl in the
American defence, atomic-
energy, and military-aid budgets.
And the people, the consumers,
then get whatever is left over.”
Of various estimates of the
proportionate break-up of the
Soviets’ national product, the
Alsops incline to that which
“shows the Soviets annuallv
spending a quarter of their gross
national product on capital
improvement and another
quarter for military purposes,
with only 50 per cent, going to
the consumers”:
“In any case, although they
quarrel among themselves about
the degree, the Russian experts
and economists are virtually
unanimous that the Soviet rates
of capital and military invest-
ment are far higher than the
Western rates. And it is very
obvious that these high invest-
ment-rates, which are necessarily
achieved at the expense of an
artificially low living-standard,
are the principal cause of the
phenomenally rapid growth of
Soviet military-industrial power.
“This growth is best measured
in terms of the four basic indus-
trial commodities, which are the
four cornerstones of the whole
structure. Since 1928, Soviet
steel-production has multiplied
10 times, from 4.5-milliOn metric
tons to 45-million. Soviet coal-
production has multiplied more
than 10 times, from 36-million
tons to 390-million. Soviet
petroleum-production has multi-
plied six times, from 12-million
tons to 70-million. And Soviet
electric-power production has
multiplied 34 times.”

their universities than are now
being graduated by the American
universities.
“The common American
theory that the Soviets ‘don’t
have the know-how,’ and have
therefore relied on spies and
German scientists to build their
Badgers and Bisons, A-bombs
and H-bombs and the rest, is
pure, self-deceiving, complacent
nonsense.
“Furthermore, the spy-and-
German-scientist theory wholly
blurs and covers-up the most
important meaning of the
ominous military - industrial
successes that the Soviets have
now achieved. These successes
mean, in fact, that the Soviet
industrial complex is not only
brutally massive, but also tech-
nologically rich. For you simply
cannot build A-bombs or H-
bombs, Bisons or Badgers
without a. formidable array .of
the most technically advanced
supporting industries, such as
electronics, and without full
mastery of all the most difficult
specialised techniques, such as
high-temperature metallurgy.”
Summarising their assessment
of Russian power, the Alsops
state that “Soviet industry has
almost exclusively grown in ways
that increase national power,
whereas American industry has
mainly grown in ways that
increase national wellbeing”:
“By this iron concentration on
national power, the Soviets have
now overcome the three-to-one
American advantage in wealth.
In naked-power terms, they are
not just catching up to the U.S.
They are actually passing the
United States in the military-
industrial power-race, as is
proven by the extraordinary
change that has been taking place
in the character of the Soviet
armed forces.
“In general, the Soviet armed
forces are not only bigger than
the American armed forces;
they are also beginning to be
much better armed. In par-
ticular, moreover, the Soviets
have made their greatest progress
in the crucial area of air-atomic
power. They are now on a par
with the U.S. in quality and well
ahead of the U.S. in production
of medium-range and long-
lange jet-bombers and both
categories of fighters.
“In nuclear weapons,
American stocks are still greater
than Soviet stocks, but their
stockpile is rapidly reaching
decisive proportions. In ballistic
missiles, Soviet technology is at
present ahead of American
technology ; for they are already
flight-testing a missile of 1500-
miles range, whereas nothing
comparable has passed the
drawing-board stage in the
United States.
“In addition, the striking-
power of the American Strategic
Air Command is almost wholly
dependent on overseas bases.
These foreign bases are not
controlled by the United States
politically, and they are soon to
be hopelessly exposed
strategically to the Soviets’ new
1500-mile ballistic missile. In
contrast, the Soviets are now
building formidable long-range
air-atomic striking-power that is
wholly self - contained, and
entirely free from the crippling
dependency that afflicts S.A.C.
Hence a period is coming, if
corrective measures are not
promptly taken, when our strike
can only wound and their strike
can kill. >
“The means of escape from
this dilemma,” the Alsops con-
clude, “are of course ready to
hand. The total resources of the
United States and the other
Western allies are still immeasur-
ably greater than the total
resources of the Soviet Union
and its imperial dependencies.
“The Western problem arises
solely from the use the Western
nations make of their great
wealth. A good deal more
invested in national defence ; a
great deal more invested in
education; the most modest
measures to reduce waste of
natural resources and to make
the general investment pattern a
bit more spare and muscular —
these things alone would be
enough to alter every time-
schedule and to upset every
calculation set forth in this
article.
“The question is not whether
we can do what is needful to
survive. The question is, rather,
whether we are willing to do
what is needful; for this
demands a measure of plain
speaking in which democratic
leaders are reluctant to indulge,
and a measure of self-denial
which, though slight, will hardly
command the enthusiasm of free
peoples long taught that, self-
indulgence is the better course.”
Freedom of the Seas
With one country and another
claiming more than the tradi-
tional three miles of territorial
waters, the United Nations has
asked the International Law
Commission (of 15 legal experts
from different countries) to
prepare a draft code of the sea
for the consideration of the
U.N. Assembly in November.
Outlining some of the
problems, London “Economist”
notes that “not many countries
have takfen things, to such an
extreme as El Salvador, which
has written into its Constitution
a claim that its territorial waters
extend 200 miles from its coast.
But several others have gone
nearly as far.
“Ecuador, Peru and Chile
between them demand the right
to exercise sovereignty over a
200-mile-wide' belt stretching
down the greater part of the
Pacific coast of South America,
and have brusquely rejected a
suggestion that they should
submit their case to the Interna-
tional Court at The Hague.
“The Soviet Union, which
claims 12 miles of territorial
water all round its sprawling
land-mass, has added injury to
insult by , forcing Japanese
salmon fishermen to accept
stringent regulations up to a
line several hundred miles from
the Siberian coast.
“Mexico, India and Yugo-
slavia, among others, have urged
the case for letting countries push
their territorial limits outside the
traditional three-piile mark.
South Korea and the Philippines
have already run a forbidding
pencil-line through the map
round their shores,
“And even the Anglo-Saxon
countries cannot look these
snappers-up of sea-space quite
straight in the eye. The
Americans have more than once
put large areas of the Pacific ‘out
of bounds’ in order to test
nuclear weapons. The British,
for their part, have encouraged
some of their protege sheikdoms
on the Persian Gulf to claim the
oil that may lie under the sea off
their shores. Claims of this last
kind are now fairly common, and
are not quite the same thing as
requisitioning the waters above ;
but they are a step back from
the purest classical doctrine of
the free seas. ,
“In the face of incipient
anarchy, however, it has fallen to
Britain and other old-established
maritime Powers to try to call a
halt. Among the mass of smaller
issues with which the commission
has been grappling, two major
problems stand out. (
“First, what is the proper
width of territorial waters, within
which coastal States are entitled
to claim full sovereignty?
Second, what lesser Powers, short
of full sovereignty, should States
be allowed to exercise outside
territorial waters to meet
the conditions of technological
change —or simply, perhaps, to
save them from the temptation
of marking off huge stretches of
sea as their own?
“The real battle will be joined
in the General Assembly, where
the nationaf interests which in the
International Law Commission
peeped out from behind the
lawyer’s robes will make their
appearance naked and un-
ashamed. Probably the best that
can now be hoped for from the
commission is a draft code
which, while falling short of
what the liberals (like Britain,
France and the United States)
want, would at least prevent the
most flagrant kind of sea-
grabbing.
“But this code will have a
rough passage through the
Assembly, even if it eventually
gets the sanction of a two-thirds
majority. The worst of the
recent offenders, like Peru, Chile
and Ecuador, have not been
represented on the commission,
and they will presumably have a
good deal to say when the
Assembly meets. And even if
the Assembly accords the code
a two-thirds majority, it is
difficult to see how it could be
enforced upon an intransigent
violator. The prospect of keep-
ing the seas free from
encroachers remains a gloomy
one.”
Various Voices
General Gruenther: “We are
dealing today with what out-
wardly appears to be a different
Soviet Union. However, I have
seen no evidence that the ultimate
Soviet goal of world domination
has changed. It would be most
dangerous to accept these surface
changes as an indication of so
basic a shift of Soviet policy
that our vigilance could be safely
relaxed.”
■Mr. Dulles: “The illusion
constantly persists that peace is
to be had merely by wanting it.
If that were true, war would have
been abolished many centuries
ago. The fact is that to keep
peace is as hard as, indeed harder
than, to win a war. Wars have
been won. But lasting peace
has never yet been won.”
Mr. Truman : “Like most
other nations, we [the United
States] are more impelled to unity
by common danger than by
common aspirations. But this
presents no problem today.
Those who look candidly and
honestly at the world about, us
must see that the common danger
has rarely been greater, though it
has often been more strident and
spectacular.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Films and TV
With TV close, it’s a pity the Federal
Government doesn’t give more thought to
Australian films. The need for encourage-
ment becomes apparent when one reads
that local TV companies are already
importing films, mostly from America.
To the Government’s credit it has
shown sufficient awareness of their
quantity and quality to announce that it
is increasing the membership of the Com-
monwealth Film Censorship Board. Yet
how much more creditable it would be if
the Government followed this with
positive assistance for the local industry.
Such a step need not involve any direct
subsidy from the Treasury. Shortly after
the last war the Italian Government,
realising what a good money-earner a
local film-industry could be, imposed a
non-prohibitive import-tax on all foreign
films. Wisely, it placed the revenue col-
lected into a special fund which was
used to assist local producers. The world-
wide financial and artistic success of post-
war Italian films has been largely due to
this policy.
Is there any reason why Australian
films, aided by such a scheme, could not
achieve similar success? Nor need the
benefits stop with the industry. The
Government itself could take a slice of
the tax to help finance national TV-
stations, which, for a few years at least,
are going to find it hard to make ends
meet without calling on the Treasury for
assistance.-— Badiped (N.S.W.).
High-handed Action
A big N.S.W. electricity undertaking
recently accepted a pensioner’s cheque in
payment of her quarterly account and,
instead of refunding the considerable
balance, merely handed her a receipt and
an acknowledgment that her account was
now in credit to the extent of several
pounds. When the pensioner protested
that she wanted the balance in cash
because she had no other money, she was
told the undertaking had a by-law which
provided that no change was to be given
for cheques.
It was small consolation to the pen-
sioner that her next quarter’s account was
already as good as paid; that wouldn’t
buy her food in the meantime.
. For all I know it could be a common
rule with local-governing bodies and
electricity undertakings not to give change
for cheques; and while that might be
necessary to thwart the fellow who
presents a bouncer for an amount in*
excess of his account, hoping to get the
balance in cash, it should certainly not
apply to pension-cheques drawn by the
Commonwealth of Australia. Dix
(N.S.W.).
N.S.W. Railways
If N. S. Wales Premier Cahill really
claims that the State Railways is a busi-
ness and should be treated as such he’s
talking through his hat. It’s not a busi-
ness, it never was, and it’s not even
desirable that it should be. It is a common
carrier the only one we’ve got —and its
primary object should be the transport
of goods where and when necessary in
the public interest and at prices dictated
by the needs of industry or development.
The economic well-being of the carrier
should be subordinated to that of its
users. The failure to realise this on the
part of all concerned is responsible for
most of the heartburning on the sub-
ject. •
Certainly Cahill is right when he asks
.for a more realistic approach. Where, for
instance, is the realism in the suggestion
(B. 20/6/’56) that the fact that the rail-
ways were profitable in 1906 should have
a bearing on the matter today? Fifty
years ago they enjoyed a complete
monopoly, and the inevitable losses on
the swings of developmental areas could
easily be made up on the roundabouts
of more populated districts. Today, not
only is there intense and killing competi-
tion but, in effect, the roundabouts are
under different management. Yet we still
expect the system to work.
Is there any realism in the approach to
the matter of fixed charges? Is there
reality in a capital-cost of £223 million to
cover 6000 miles of largely single-track
line, 1200 ancient locos and other equip-
ment in a similar state? For 100 years
we have gone on putting more and more
money into the system without making
any serious provision for writing-off the
scrapped or redundant. For how long
are we to maintain the pretence that the
current administration should be able to
go on meeting the charges when they so
obviously cannot do so?
Is there any reality in the public atti-
tude to the large sums allegedly paid the
commissioner towards the cost of
operating non-paying lines, few of which
were ever expected to pay? Thirty year's
ago Parliament accepted financial respon-
sibility for this “loss,” then amounting to
£BOO,OOO a year. By the time they con-
descended to raise the figure to a million
the actual loss was of the order of
million, and today it’s probably between
£3 and £4 million. Is there a trace of
realism in a system where the commis-
sioner has to adjust his charges in a
manner most detrimental to his com-
petitive position in order to make enough
profit to cover these so-called “losses"?
The whole sorry show seems to operate
in a world of fantasy where realism has
never been heard of. — Transporticus
(Singapore).
Victorian Iron Ore
Before he left the U.S.A. for London
Victorian Premier Bolte said four big
American firms had stated that they
would be interested in large-scale develop-
ment of recently discovered iron-ore
deposits in Gippsland if further tests
showed the deposits to be four times as
large as those already proved.
That is a distinct possibility, for surveys
up to the present indicate that the deposits
may be sufficient to enable Victoria to
establish a steel-industry on a major scale.
The area is about 15 miles long and
three miles wide, between Nowa Nowa
township, 213 miles from Melbourne on
the Princes Highway (Melbourne-Sydney
road), and the Buchan Caves, 20 miles
north.
It all started with a search for oil. In
1951 the Bureau of Mineral Resources
made a magnetometer survey of the
locality from the air and lound no
indications of oil, but evidence of large-
scale iron-ore deposits beneath small
surface-outcrops.
Later, the bureau, in co-operation with
the Victorian Mines Department, made a
ground-survey of the most promising sec-
tions. Results were so encouraging that
the Mines Department geologists took
over.
After a number of tests they concen-
trated op a small area seven miles north
of Nowa Nowa and began sinking three
diamond-drills, which will be put down
to 600 ft. The work is still in progress.
The geologists say that this small area
alone could contain about 15-million tons
of ore. Seven such areas could provide
more than the ore-reserve of 100-million
tons which, it is understood, American
concerns regard as the minimum before
they would invest.
“The fish will be DELIGHTED with that rod , sir”
Another recent discovery could give an
invaluable fillip to a Gippsland steel-
industry. Last year the Victorian Gas and
Fuel Corporation and the School of
Metallurgy of Melbourne University,
pooling their resources, evolved a coking-
process permitting the conversion of
Morwell’s brown coal to a hard coke
suitable for steel-manufacture. Previously
brown coal was regarded as useless for
this purpose. Morwell is 119 miles from
Nowa Nowa.
In addition, Buchan has ample supplies
of limestone, another essential for
pigiron-production. The luck of
geography could, therefore, play an
important pcftt in the development of a
steel-industry.
Australia could well do with the
establishment of another iron-ore field.
Principal ore-bodies of large extent and
high grade are at Iron Knob (S.A.) and
Yampi Sound (W.A.). Estimates of
reserves there are 150-million tons and
100-million tons respectively.—Bulls-
wool (Vic.).
Cahill’s Opera House
News that the Royal Opera House in
London, better-kflown as Covent Garden,
is losing £lOO,OOO a year despite an annual
Government subsidy of £250,000 should
give a jolt to N. S. Wales Premier Cahill’s
plan to spend a million pounds building
an opera-house in Sydney.
If Premier Cahill wants any further
evidence that the venture would be better
left alone he should read the story of the
plight in which the Cheltenham (Eng.)
Council has found itself after buying a
local 50-year-old opera-house for £23,000.
Opera, ballet and straight plays have had
no box-office appeal, and now the council
has resolved to permit the staging of nude
shows in the hope that this wifi help to
balance the budget.
Premier Cahill is at his wit’s end to
make his transport-services pay, but the
bother he is in over increased fates and
freights would be nothing compared to
the storm that would result if fie proposed
to get his opera-house out of the red by
putting on nude entertainment.
Mr. Cahill’s million would be better
spent on a hospital or some school-
additions.—-Peter Simple (N.S.W.).
Weekend Work and Working Wives
“D.J.” is right (B. 27/6/’56) in con-
demning highly paid weekend work, but
he doesn’t get to the crux of the matter.
Weekend work must be related to
another social problem of today, lightly
touched-on in “Tax-rebates for Wives”
(also B. 27/6/’56) —the matter of work-
ing wives.
Most men who have two jobs (such as
a second job at weekends) are young
married men with a wife and family to
support—i.e., a wife engaged in her right-
ful, domestic, duties. Nowadays such
a man must have two jobs if he’s to build
a home and generally keep up with the
man whose wife goes out to work.
The economy today is clearly based, for
a man earning an average wage, on a two-
job income—with either himself or his
wife providing the second. It was recently
announced by the Commonwealth
Statistician that one Australian woman in
four now works. If the holding of a
second job is forbidden, it will unduly
penalise the man whose wife, for family-
or for health-reasons, can’t go working.
Remember he’s the man who, by raising a
family, is doing more to safeguard the
national future.
I agree that the holding-down of two
jobs is an evil,' and should be stopped,
where possible; but, if such becomes
established Government policy, I also
think there should be a policy to dis-
courage the man-and-wife working-team,
probably a main cause for general high
prices. The best discouragement would,
of course, be by high taxation. —
KejokadA' (Vic.).
Coastal Shipping
“Ceg’s” remarks on Government-
owned shipping (B. 25/4/’56) don’t give
the whole picture.
When the Commonwealth Government
Line was disposed of in 1928 the balance-
sheet for the end of that financial year
disclosed an appreciable profit.
When the Government entered the
overseas passenger-trade in 1922 it had
on its hands the residue of a fleet of 63
ships still awaiting 'sale. These were
made up of ex-enemy ships, those pur-
chased in the U.K. and those built in the
U.S.A. and in this country. The fleet
was a necessary adjunct to any war-
effort and had rendered excellent service.
When this residue was finally disposed
of, the remainder of the fleet, consisting
of five “Bay” liners and two excellent
freighters, were able to stand on their
own feet and turned in dividends.
Before that the earnings of the seven
working units were, for the most part,
ploughed-back into the cost of care and
maintenance of the dead units still
awaiting buyers. The fact of this profit
was possibly a good selling-point which
influenced the buyer.
“Ceg” suggests that the ships were dis-
posed of to the benefit of all concerned.
In point of fact, the buyer was the only
one who benefited.
“Ceg” also overlooks the fact that Aus-
tralia, as an island continent, must have'
a merchant-fleet, whether provided by
private shipowner or the Government.
Inter-State transport, too, could never be
fully catered for by rail, road and air.
And who but the Government is to step
into the , breach if the shipowner, not
satisfied with his profits, walks out of
the picture?
The old' Commonwealth Line was
always a deterrent to the inclination of
overseas shipowners to hoist freight-
rates —overseas freight-rates rose 25 per
cent, the day after the line was sold io
May, 1928.
Australia should have learnt its lesson
in 1928, yet the urge to dispense with
the present fleet still persists.— AjrpO

1092 MT. ALEXANDER ROAD, ESSENDON,
truth there is in the theory that
if your horse comes down on
top of you, you are less liable
to suffer internal injuries if you
are empty. I know we all
believed it, and we always acted
accordingly. Come to think of
it, it was about the only pre-
caution we ever did take.
T'HE cattle saw us first, but as
we had stumbled on them
in heavy pear-and-wilga scrub
I think they had no more than
twenty or thirty yards start on
.us when they raced off. We
caught a glimpse of red-and-
white amongst the green, heard
the sticks cracking, and we were
off at a mad gallop, with Mick
immediately taking the lead.
Mad! A man not used to it
would look on it as sheer lunacy,
but there is only one way to
ride in scrub. Give your horse
his head and trust him im-
plicitly. Start trying to guide
him, and you simply confuse
him, and before long you find
yourself wrapped around a
tree. Mick didn’t even bother
to hold his horse together; he
let the reins flap loosely, spurred
his horse over or through the
most astounding obstacles, and
shouted with sheer excitement
all the time.
“It’s marvellous what you’ll
crash through when y’r blood’s
up,” he had said.
It seemed to me Mick’s blood
was always up. He was gallop-
ing almost as soon as the cattle
were, leaping over tangles of
pear and fallen timber, ducking
under heavy branches, shoulder-
ing the lighter ones aside, and
heeding nothing except the rac-
ing cattle.
Knowing how much easier it
is to follow another horseman
than to strike a line for your-
self, I kept close behind him.
I saw him urge his horse up
level with the leaders, saw him
force them out on to the plain;
yet even as I shouted encourage-
ment I realised how hopeless it
all was.
The plain was. only a plain in
name, less than two-hundred
yards across in its widest part,
and we had no sooner swung the
leaders when they were back in
the scrub again. Worse still, the
mob was splitting-up, and for
some unaccountable reason
every man seemed to be in the
wrong place.
I admit I set a bad example,
but, like Mick’s, my blood was
up. Right in front of me a clean-
skin cow was streaking for the
timber, and I remember think-
ing, “If we get nothing else out
of the mess I’ll get you, me girl.”
I threw her, leaped off and flung
myself across her hindquarters.
There was not a man or
another beast in sight as I undid
the bull-strap around my waist
and strapped the cow’s hind-legs
tightly together. The only liv-
ing things in sight were my horse
quietly cropping grass about
twenty yards away, and a
leatherhead chattering softly to
himself in a near-by wilga-bush.
The feeding horse and the
chattering bird made everything
seem so ridiculously peaceful
after those last rip-roaring
minutes. But that is how it so
often is with scrubber-running.
One minute the scrub is filled
with the noise of galloping
hooves and crashing timber, and
the .next it is unnaturally quiet,
reminding you that this is one
more failure.
It is the same when your horse
falls. Before you have struggled
to your feet and satisfied your-
self you are still in one piece the
noise of the chase has faded,
smothered in the dense growth
around you.
I caught my horse and rode
over to the bottle-tree, arriving
there in time to see Steve limp-
ing out of the scrub, leading his
horse. He had crashed in the
first fifty yards, he told me. No,
he said, he wasn’t seriously hurt,
but he’d landed in a pear-bush
and was “as full of spikes as a
bloody porcupine.”
CHAPTER XII
XHRILLS and spills! We cer-
"*■ tainly had our share of both
during that week. I was becom-
mg a scrub - rider and bull-tosser,
and I must admit I was enjoying
myself. It was impossible to do
otherwise in an atmosphere that
constantly alternated between
hushed expectancy and wild
elhtion, impossible not to agree
whh Mick when he declared we
had never had so much fun in
“"And” he added with a burst
° £ ! au * hter ’ “° ld Joe Carson ’ s
payin ’ <us for lt .”
j had a twi of conscience
then Carson was certainly pay-
ing us - And what wa « he getting
for his money? By sundown on
the fifth day we had put his ear-
mark on a y dozen big cleanskins,
scared the daylights out of
heaven knows how many more,
and established the fact that
there were many fat bullocks,
Yakaparnis and strangers, living
in the scrubs. We had tempor-
arily lamed two horses, and we
had not yarded a single beast.
Not a report calculated to put
any owner in a good humor!
The twinge didn’t last long.
Tomorrow was another day, and
there was always the chance that
,we might yard a worth-while
mob. That was what the boys
said. And I was content to agree
with them, instead of. reminding
myself that the chance was very,
very slim.
Not one of us escaped with-
out a crash, yet no one was seri-
ously hurt. Mick put up the
record of two falls in one day.
His mare fell with him during
a chase in the morning and threw
him in the afternoon. He was
not even bruised in the first fall,
but he suffered badly in the
second. It was the only time I
ever saw him incapable of
laughter.
We were riding along .at a
walk in open brigalow-country,
and Mick was in the lead. His
reins were flapping loosely, and
he was humming to himself as
he ducked casually under an
overhanging limb.
If he had looked up he would
have seen the hornet’s-nest, a
circle of waxen cells as big as a
soup-plate, bristling with huge
red-hornets.
As it was, he only felt them.
They came down in a swarm,
driving their .vicious stings into
horse and rider. The mare
dropped her head in a flying
buck, and Mick, half-crazy with
pain and still unaware of the
cause of it all, sailed clean over
her ears.
The sight of the mare still
bucking madly and Mick beat-
ing the air with his hat as he
struggled to his feet was too
much for us; we laughed
loudly, and kept a safe distance
away. There is nothing in the
Queensland bush more painful
than the sting of a red-hornet,
and we found Mick had eight
stings, angry red-and-white
circles, on his back. In spite of
his shirt, each had drawn blood.
.it t
His mare took almost as much
pacifying as he did. Steve
counted twelve big lumps on her
rump and flanks.
No wonder she bucked! No
wonder Mick yelled!
'T'HE ducks were back on the
lagoon, and once again we
lived luxuriously. The only thing
we missed was Wonga’s yarn-
spinning round the campfire.
No, there was nothing wrong
with Wonga, and he had not
exhausted his supply of yarns.
He spent his evenings fishing.
There were perch in the lagoon
and there were eels. Once we
discovered that, we all became
enthusiastic, for a while. But,
with the exception of Wonga,
we were not true fishermen. We
tired of it quickly, and if the fish
did not bite at once we were apt
to lie back and gaze up at the
stars, leaving our lines
unattended while we yarned over
the day’s events.
Wonga neither lolled back nor
joined in the conversation. He
squatted there, silent' and
immobile, watching the float that
never seemed to cause a ripple
on the dark surface of the
lagoon. Yet every now and again
we would hear a flapping as he
tossed a fish into the grass
behind him. And every morning
there would be fish for breakfast.
On the sixth day we drew a
blank. Except for a short break
for lunch on the edge of a small
waterhole, we rode all day with-
out sighting a single beast. It
just wasn’t our lucky day, we
decided, as we headed back for
the yards along a cattle-pad
dusty with old tracks.
We weren’t even taking the
ordinary precautions of speak-
ing quietly or keeping a sharp
lookout. As far as we were
concerned the day was over.
The sun was nearly down and
the open country less than half-
a-mile ahead.
And then we saw them, the
tail-end of a mob stringing
quietly along for a night in the
open country!
They heard us and took fright
immediately, so that there was
no time to make plans or give
orders.
Every man did as he thought
best, and for once we all did the
right thing.
Mick raced to the right flank,
with me close behind him. Steve
and Duffy galloped away to the
left, and Wonga stayed in the
tail.
It was a case of crowd them
and keep them galloping in the
direction they had foolishly
chosen, straight for the open
country.

THE DAYDREAM
Testing myself, I mused that you were dead;
acted the drama in my mind: a friend,
who thought 1 knew you casually, said
that you had died. I did not comprehend,
and strolled on, trusting that he meant another,
a moment melancholy with that fear
of death that only death itself can smother;
life shouts, girls laugh, the dawn must reappear.
Till knowledge shrieking fiercer than the sun
dried every sense but pain, and pain endured;
and through this desolation I must run
forever, never to your loss inured . . .
Touch me . . . this play grows real beyond en-
durance;
only your living flesh gives reassurance.

MILK RECORDING
/COMMENTS by “Agricola”
(B. 27/6/’56) on milking-
machine efficiency and the excel-
lent work started by Petersen
and the Ruakura boys bring to
mind the great weakness of the
releaser-type milking-machine:
its inability to record the produc-
tion of the individual cow.
Beside the losses springing
directly from this weakness,
losses quoted by “Agricola”—9l
hours and 365 gallons of milk,
which would come to less than
£lt)0 p.a.—are negligible. At a
lecture I attended on the N. S.
Wales South Coast recently, a
young studman summed-up the
problem rather well. Why, he
asked, was his grandfather’s
average production greater than
his own —taking into considera-
tion the: great advances in our
knowledge of nutrition, engineer-
ing, genetics and what-have-
you?
The questioner, of course, left
himself wide-open for an unflat-
tering comparison between his
grandfather and himself as
farmers; and the opportunity
was not lost. But, jokes aside, this
young man was a good farmer,
and everyone knew it. The
lecturer then gave his real
opinion: Grandfather hand-
milked, therefore, couldn’t help
recording—that is to say, taking
note of—the production of each
cow in the herd, daily.
He could feed according to
production, progeny-test his
bulls, and pick the onset of
disease immediately ; his dairy-
herd carried no passengers, and
he had a proper basis for breed-
ing. Maybe he didn’t call every-
thing he did by these names, but
the results, by and large, were
the same.
The releaser-type machine
speeded-up milking-time and
took a lot of the drudgery out
of dairying. More cows could
be milked per man, and more
money could be made, But, at
the same time, it nullified the
advantages of hand-milking.
The young breeder didn’t know
his cows nearly as well as his
grandfather had known his.
But these disadvantages can
be overcome by a scientific
system of recording. There are
three main systems: the bucket,
the Alfa Laval Combine, and
the Smalls Volumetric Milk
Recorder. The bucket is useful
and accurate, provided a proper?
check is kept on the scales, but
it takes time, it’s hard work, and
it disturbs the milking-routine
The Alfa Laval Combine and the
Smalls Recorder answer the
problem very well.
The Combine can be used only
where new machines are being
installed, but it is efficient,
accurate, and easy to use. The
Smalls Recorder can be used on
any existing machine provided
there is a dummy bail, or a posi-
tion for one, to support it, and,
like the Combine, takes no extra
time or labor apart from turning
two taps and writing the yield
on a chart.
A herd-improvement scheme
is employed in the Various States
by the Departments of Agri-
culture—l know only the details
of the N. S. Wales one, but
imagine the others are similar.
The Scheme is good, but it has
limitations. The recording is
done monthly—daily is the ideal,
weekly is the outside limit, owing
to variations in yield.
The scheme is limited in scope
—approximately 1400 out of the
17,000 dairyfarmers in N.S.W.
belong to it. Bucket-recording
is the method used, and this, as
mentioned earlier, can upset the
milking-routine. And the scheme
is open to abuse. Knowing when
a tester is coming round, a man
can pump his cows’ production
Up to an artificial level. Why?
Vanity, perhaps; or for more
substantial rewards in the sale-
yard or show-ring.
While criticising the depart-
ment’s scheme, I am well aware
that, Udder present conditions,
it Is the only possible one. But
in the future, when recording-
machines are more generally
used, I suggest that the herd-
recording scheme should become
merely a check, the actual
recording being done by the
farmer.
The scheme would work some-
thing like this: The farmer
would use a machine which had
been approved by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture for official
testing of milk-production. He
would record at least once a
week, and these records would
be checked by an inspector, who
would come around at irregular
and unknown times and make
his own tests, comparing the
day’s figures with the farmer’s
previous ones. An average would
be made, and any significant dis-
crepancy would soon be picked-
up.
This would save a lot of
farmers from duping themselves
and the people who buy then-
stock ; it would also allow many
farmers to come into the present
scheme without increasing the
staff beyond practical bounds.
The comparatively small
number of farmers who record
the production of their cows is
one of the chief causes of
inefficiency in the industry. And,
of those who do record, a large
proportion don’t put their
records to the best use. Knowing
what each cow gives is only a
part of the costing of milk-
“ Don't kill him — We've got plenty to eat.”
production, but it is an important
part—the key to greater profit
arid to progressively lifting the
average of the herd.
A survey carried out in
England reveals some interesting
comparisons. There, farmers
who recorded produced milk at
6d. a gallon less, and had a herd-
average of 200 gallons more, than
farmers who didn’t record.
JOHN BRIDGES.
Managing Phalaris
Phalaris (Phalaris tuberosa)
has a definite place in any
pasture - improvement pro-
gramme. Because it is a deep-
rooted perennial grass, it is
particularly suited to a rainfall
of between 22in. and 28in. per
annum. In these districts, dry
summers are very often too
severe for perennial-rye-grass
and cocksfoot.
Many farmers and graziers
have been disappointed with
phalaris pastures, claiming that
it becomes too rank and stock
neglect it. This disadvantage is
definitely a question of manage-
ment, arid can be overcome. To
get the best out of phalaris, it
must be grazed hard and kept
grazed.
When phalaris is young and
closely grazed, it has a high
protein value —in fact as high
as rye-grass—but as the plants
get older, protein falls quickly ;
much faster than in rye-grass.
With maturity, the percentage of
fibre increases in both.
Compare the following figures
for. protein and fibre (as a per-
centage of dry-matter) in phalaris
and Wimmera-rye-grass at these
different stages: (1) Young and
closely grazed; (2) older growth
as hay:—
Protein. Fibre,
(p.c.) (p.c.)
Phalaris (1) 24.8 18.4
(2) 3.4 27.6
Rye-grass (1) £2.2 16.6
(2) 9.4 32.9
The main point is that the
protein in phalaris drops sharply
from 24.8 per cent, to 3.4 per
cent.; so it is not surprising that
stock neglect those old phalaris
tussocks! To get the best
protein-feed from phalaris, it
must be kept short; and this
can only be achieved by having
paddocks of a size where grazing
cart Be controlled. Management
of phalaris pasture by rotational
grazing with large numbers of
stock is essential to success.
Where phalaris is grown with
other grasses in mixtures,
phalaris will become dominant,
not only because of its aggressive
nature, but also because it loses
protein quicker than other
grasses. It is therefore better to
sow phalaris alone with com-
panion clovers —but here, again,
care must be taken that these
nitrogen - builders are not
overgrazed.
One of the best phalaris-sub.-
clover pastures I have seen is a
30-acre paddock on a property
at Yass (N.S.W.). The grazing
system is to “mob-stock” with
sheep, follow-up with cattle, and
finally even-up any rank growth
by mowing. Under this scheme,
the pasture is always under
control, protein is high, and a
good balance between phalaris
and sub.-clover is maintained. A
further example is a six-acre
phalaris-white-clover pasture at
C.5.1.R.0. Research Station,
Armidale (N.S.W.), which
carried a minimum of eight sheep
per acre over a period of 21
months. Phalaris was never
more than 6in. high!
Phalaris may become sod-
bound and compacted after
several years. Severe renovations
with heavy scarifier, chisel-
plough, or mouldboard-plough
will break this compacted
surface, and rejuvenate the
stand. In most cases, it will not
be necessary to reintroduce
clovers, as they will again grow
vigorously once the sod has been
disturbed. Autumn or early
Winter is the best , time to
renovate and re-establish clover,
particularly subterranean-clover.
IVf. V. O’Reilly.
Lucerne-cocktail
“Boneo”: Although many
lucerne-growers prefer to keep
their stands free of other plants
and weeds—even to the exten
of scarifying paddocks in the
autumn —some English, farmers
are using lucerne-grass mixtures
In most cases this involves
sowing alternate rows of lucerne
and rye-grass. Some European
strains of lucerne seem to be
more adaptable to grazing than
the Hunter River kind, which is
usually mowed on our irrigation
areas.
The English idea is good in so
far as it spreads the grazing-
period of the paddock during the
late winter and early spring,
when lucerne is comparatively
dormant, and through the
summer and early autumn, when
rye-grass does not grow much.
Key to the situation is good
management, to avoid killing the
lucerne by overgrazing it. Take
the sheep off it before they begin
to eat the crowns.
Sowing in alternate rows
increases the possibility of
lucerne-plants growing larger
than at the conventional 7in.
spacing, especially under natural-
rainfall conditions.
Young Men for fhe
North
“Jackeroo”: In all ages, find-
ing fault with the younger
generation is a favorite sport of
the oldsters. But lately, apart
from a deal of public moralis-
ing about bodgies and their
doings (what about the larrikin
pushes of Grandfather’s day?),
graziers, station - managers,
pastoral-company executives and
the like have been breaking into
print deploring the dearth of
young men venturing into the
outback, and the quality of
those who do; hard-bitten
Territorians will tell you that
the young blokes of today are
soft, that they can’t take a bit
of hard yakka and yearn for
the bright lights ; and so on, ad
infinitum.
In all this, of course, there is
some truth, but it has been over-
stated. And there are two sides
to the' question. The young mad
of today has been reared in an
environment totally different
from the one his grandfather
knew, but, taking things alto-
gether, life on the big cattle-
stations is much as it was then.
True, there have been im-
provements in certain directions.
Medical help—thanks, largely,
to the foresight and outspoken-
ness of Dr. John Flynn—is no
longer a source of anxiety. The
pedal-wireless and, in some
areas, the telephone, have helped
span the lonely miles ; mail is
delivered regularly to the most
remote areas by plane. But . . .
What happens to a young man
when, stirred by the same spirit
of adventure that moved his
ancestors, and giving up more
in the way of comfort and
pleasure than they did, he joins
a pastoral company as a
jackeroo, with the express wish

to be sent to a station in the
outback? He arrives, and he
is shown the jackeroos’ quarters,
which (depending on the com-
pany he has joined) may be
anything from a substantial
wooden bungalow to a tin-shed.
But in any case it doesn’t matter
much, because for 12 months
of the year he’ll probably be
living with, and like, aborigines
in a stock-camp.
He’ll find that being a
jackeroo is in itself an obstacle
which he can never quite clear.
His companions and teachers,
some managers and all head-
stockmen and white station-*
hands resent him. He has had
a better start in life than they
have had, but he hasn’t their
practical knowledge of stock-
work and station-work, and he
has been pitchforked into their
world. The resentment •is often
unconscious: it is nevertheless
uncomfortable.
The ambitious jackeroo will
find himself working from
daylight till dark —and after
dark—every day of the week, on
a diet of corned-meat, dried-
fruit and tea. He’ll find, if by
some mischance he spends any
length of time at the station-
homestead, more snobbery and
petty jealousy among the
managers and their wives than
he’ll find in the West End of
London. And he’ll find, more
often than not, from the top to
the bottom of the company, a
complete lack of interest in his
welfare.
An exaggerated picture? Per-
haps ; but no more so than the
one periodically painted of my
generation by letter-writing
pastoralists, station - managers
and company-executives. Obvi-
ously, there are good stations
and bad ones. But it has been
my experience that the majority
of company-owned stations in
Northern Australia do mete out
this sort of' treatment to
jackeroos—and then complain
that they can’t keep their men.
Criticism, if it is to do any
good, must be constructive. But
the problem, when ajl the pros
and cons are weighed, remains
a tough one.
Under present conditions no
young man, unless he has about
£50,000, can hope to establish
himself on the land in Northern
Australia and make a success
of it. So there is only one way
he can live in that part of the
country and eventually run a
property himself: by working
for a pastoral company.
Therefore, the onus of de-
veloping the cattle-industry, and
with it our northern defences,
rests largely on the- big com-
panies. Perhaps it is an unfair
burden. But, so far as immedi-
ate improvements are con-
cerned improving properties
and stock and attracting the
right type of young men from
the south —the .companies are
the decisive factor: they are the
only owners with sufficient capi-
tal to do anything on a sufficient
scale to influence overall
development.
In the big pastoral companies
there are a few men in positions
of authority who, while they
are faithful servants of their
companies, have a vision large
enough to see the future of the
country, and how Australia’s
interests can be served by a
flourishing industry in the
North. There are others whose
ambitions are confined to
making short-term profits, by
any kind of cheeseparing pos-
sible. Dividends must be paid,
and as little as possible spent
on the properties.
It seems to me that if the
North is to be developed, the
larger companies must spend
more money on buildings,
fences, water-facilities, yards,
equipment and food and enter-
tainment for the men who work
for them. It must be said that,
over the last few years, most
companies have made some
improvements. But this has
come through Government
pressure, not from the initiative
of the companies. If the big
pastoral companies cannot face
up to these or
are unable to do so for financial
reasons, some other system of
developing the North will have
to be dfevised. Otherwise
Northern Australia will be no
more developed in 50 yekrs’ time
than it is today.
When I was in Texas (U.S.A.)
last year a young rancher said
to me: “You know, there’s no
future in cattle for a young
fellow just starting in this
country; it’s all big business
here. They used to tell us at
agricultural college that Aus-
tralia was the land of oppor-
tunity for young fellows, maybe
I ought to go over there. What
do you think?”
What did I think?
Hydatid Campaign
“G.”: Last month a cam-
paign to eradicate hydatid-
disease began in the Gundagai
Pastures Protection Board dis-
trict—'a really important begin-
ning.
At Tumut a gathering of
stockowners saw films made by
the Australian Wool Bureau
and heard talks and asked
questions. The films dealt with
hydatids, black-scour worms
and distemper.
Grahame Edgar, Director of
Veterinary Research in the
N.S.W. Department of- Agricul-
ture, gave a talk on diseases of
cattle, and M. A. Gemmell, who,
as George Aitkin Pastoral Re-
search Trust Fellow, has been
working on hydatid-disease in
sheep and dogs, discussed the
life-cycle of the hydatid-tape-
worm and outlined control-
methods. He described the way
in which the eradication cam-
paign would be waged and
■expressed appreciation of the
generous gift by Parke Davis
and Co. of the drug arecoline-
hydrobromide, which will be
distributed free to stockowners
for regular three-monthly treat-
ment of their dogs.
A well-known Sydney surgeon
spoke about hydatid-disease in
man, and control of worm-
parasites in sheep was discussed
by Hugh Gordon, of the Mc-
Master Animal Health Labora-
tory, C.S.LR.O.
J. Keep talked on some
diseases of dogs.
There was a filmi-night in
Gundagai, and a second field-
day at Cootamundra, where two
color-films on footrot were
shown. These films were made
by the Australian Wool Bureau,
and one of them had its “world
premiere” showing in Gundagai.
At the Cootamundra meeting
Dr. D. F. Stewart, Officer-in-
Charge of the McMaster Animal
Health Laboratory, talked on
footrot and other foot-diseases
of sheep.
Silage for Sheep
“St. Geo.”: Although silage
can cause sheep to lose condi-
tion when it is fed alone, it can
be a valuable supplement to
other fodder. N.S.W. research-
workers say that lib. of hay and
of silage a day is better
for a sheep than 31b. of silage
alone, s
Much better than 2|lb. of
silage is of silage arid 4oz.
of maize a head. While sheep
are strong, lib. of silage a head
daily is enough for the flock.
Eventually, when they get used
to it, sheep will eat 31b. of
silage a day each, so long-as it
is supplemented with grain, hay
or dry-feed.
One to li ton would be
enough silage for 1000 sheep for
a day. Two 35-ton pits of
silage would give 1000 sheep an
adequate ration for about two
months. It would last longer
according to the amount of
other feed available.
Farm Mints
“S.”: On most places, when
some cement is needed for a job
the bag left-over from last time
is hard and useless. An easy- and
simple way to keep cement in
good condition for years is to
cut in the top of a 40-gallon
drum an oval hole large enough
for a shovel to go in. A 40-
gallon drum will hold six bags of
cement. Carefully flatten the
rough edges of the hole and of
the piece cut out; now cut a
piece of strong brown paper,
overlapping an inch or so all
round the lid made from the
drum (the piece cut out), grease
it well, put it over the hole and
put the lid on this. If kept air-
tight like this, cement will keep
indefinitely.
“C.”: Rugs for cows can be
made by sewing together three
or four wheat-bags. They
become oily after being worn for
a time, and this helps to water-
proof them, to some extent.
“Sevenelms”: Don’t be too
quick to blame the kids if leads
on the tractor are off the spark-
plugs. Either the texture or the
taste of the rubber-insulation
attracts calves, and when they
drag sideways and downwards
they spdil the snug fit of the
terminal clips. Vealers do it in
the paddock, even with the
engine running and the driver a
few yards distant opening-up a
bale of meadow-hay.
“C.A.A.”: Scarcity of potatoes
has focused more attention than
usual on seed-potatoes, and how
small they can be. As a general
rule, seed-potatoes shouldn’t be
less than loz. in weight.
“Newlyn”: For backyard
graziers: hitch your goat to an
old motor - tyre. Although
tethering to a 4 post is not
recommended, a tyre allows a
goat to roam after feed in a
restricted area without the need
for fencing. Check regularly to
make sure that the tyre doesn’t
get caught on stumps or bushes.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(30/ 6/’56)
There seems little doubt that the Single cycle is still
the main seasonal control, and in these circumstances fairly
heavy general rains should occur in many areas during
July and particularly in Queensland and N. S. Wales.
Owing to sunspot activity the rains of July could be
considerably intensified, and, this coming on top of the
recent heavy rains, severe flooding could be experienced
in portion of Queensland and in many areas of N. S. Wales.
The position will require close watching.
Further gales and rains are likely in the southern
States, including N. S. Wales, during the first half of July,
particularly between July 6 and July 8.
Rainfall should moderate to some extent during August,
although further heavy falls and consequent flooding is
likely in Victoria.

Blade Stump
By
J. C. SHELLEY
CROOKED MICK was
working for the Electricity
Department/ in Deadand-
gone. The foreman called
him over to the office and said,
“1 here's a disconnection for
non-payment out at the Black
Stump that I want you to do
first thing this morning, Mick.”
Mick took the blue form from
the foreman’s hands and rubbed
the back of his neck reflectively.
He was tall and lean, with a
hard, wind-bitten face and a
humorous twinkle in his grey
eyes. He was also inclined to
be a bit bandy from nearly being
born on a horse,* but since join-
ing the County Council he’d
laid aside his riding-boots and
long-necked spurs as trucks
didn’t need that sort of a boost
to get ’em going. But he still
stuck to his jodhpurs, grey flannel
shirt and wide-brimmed hat that
rolled up a bit at the edges.
Mick was no good at thinking
without his hat.
The blue form in his hand was
nothing strange to him. He’d
dealt with them before. They
were for people who had for-
gotten to pay their electricity-
bills. There was quite a ritual
laid down in staff-instruction
ninety-eight about these forms:
An officer of the County Council
carrying out disconnections for non-
payment must first disconnect supply
at the premises by withdrawing the
main fuse, then acquaint the con-
sumer of his presence and present
personally to the consumer the
attached account. If the consumer
expresses the wish to pay the account
the officer is to accept payment plus
a further ten-shillings for a re-connec-
tion fee and then restore supply by
inserting the main fuse.
All of which Mick had read.
Mick squinted at the address on
the form and ventured a query.
“This here Black Stump, Joe ;
where is it?”
“Right up in the Gnashing-
teeth Mountains,” Joe said, turn-
ing back to the pile of papers on
his desk.
Mick went out into the depot-
yard still scratching the back of
his neck. For years and years
he’d heard references to this
Black Stump, but nobody seemed
to know where it was. They said
“Aw, up at the Stump.”
Or “The other side of the Black
Stump,” or something like that;
but no one seemed to know its
exact whereabouts. Mick was a
bit intrigued. Here it was, after
all these years, a definite address
on a bit of paper.
He hoped he could “acquire”
the bill. It would be something
to hand around Slab-face Joe’s
bar, but he guessed Sceptical Jim
wouldn’t believe it. He went over
to where the storeman was filling
the truck with petrol.
“Where you heading today,
Mick?” Basil asked.
“Out to the Black Stump,”
Mick said, expecting a horse-
laugh from Basil.
■OUT the storeman voiced
33 concern. “You haven’t got
a disconnection-order for old
Price, have you?”
“Just take a gander at this.”
Mick proffered the blue form.
“’Struth!” Basil was highly
concerned. “You’d better look
out, mate. It’s real dynamite up
there. Anything special you'd
like written on your tombstone?”
“Just a picture of one of them
old-time schooners with a hand-
grip,” Mick grinned. “You tryin’
to scare me dff seein’ this Black
Stump by any chance?”
“No fear. You’re not a bad
sort, mate ; and I’d sooner see
you die peaceful in your bed
than come to a sudden end up
there. Old man Price’s a bit
queer. Specially where money's
concerned. Got a daughter, too ;
real humdinger. She’d put
Marilyn Monroe in the shade
quick-smart if they took her to
Hollywood. Some fellers that
have gone up there with all the
honorable intentions in the world
have come back pronto with the
fear of the devil in their eyes,”
“She must be • some sheila,”
Mick said.
“It’s not Genevieve’s fault,”
Basil hastened to enlighten him.
“It’s the old man. Fair tartar,
old man Price.”
“Ah, well,” Mick said, “at
least I’ll have a good gander at
this Black Stump. Haven’t you
ever been curious of its where-
abouts, mate?”
“Who, me?” Basil looked
surprised. “Never gave it any
thought. Took it for granted, I
suppose. Sort of knew it was
out there, and that’s all there
was to it.”
“Beats Christmas,” Mick
reckoned; and, whistling
happily, got into the truck and
headed out of town.
'THE road lay due-west across
A the plain, but towards mid-
morning the Gnashing-teeth
Mountains loomed up.
Mick was feeling good. It was
time, he thought, that he had a
weekend back home at Specwah.
Slab-face Joe still got his beer
„in in wooden casks. You can’t
taste better than beer straight off
the wood.
On the other hand there’d be
a good half-day of fun convinc-
ing Sceptical Jim that the Black
Stump did really exist. After
today the mystery of that
mythical bit of wood would exist
no more. From today everyone
would be able to say definitely,
“Oh, the Black Stump. Sure, it’s
up in the Gttashing-teeth Moun-
tains. Crooked Mick set eyes on
it.”
Suddenly the mountains were
right over Mick. He switched
his headlights on and kept head-
ing west because the road still
went that way. But it was dark,
pitch-dark, and the further in
that he drove the colder the air
became.
“Strike me roan! ” Mick
ruminated out loud. “Must be
drivin’ hell-bent into a
'frigerator. Wonder what people
want to- live away up here for?”
He peered to either side in the
gloom, but could see nothing.
He began to feel Uneasy. If it
hadn’t been for the road still
ploughing ahead he’d have
reckoned he was on the wrong
track. Slowing down to take a
sharp bend he was astonished to
hear a voice bawling, him out.
He pulled up sharply, peering
into the darkness whence
the voice had come. A bulky
figure appeared, complaining
lustily.
“•fast like all you flamin’
tourists. Drive like hell, and to
blazes with us pedestrians.”
The complainer spied the
writing on the side of the truck.
“Har, flamin’ County Council,
eh? Say, it ain’t ruddy meter-
l'eadin’ time yet?”
Mick said that that was right,
and that he VvaS looking for a
man by the name of Price.
“Old Blatherskite? Ain’t paid
his account, eh? Well, you got
iny sympathy, mate. If you can
prise dough out of him you’ll
qualify for a debt-collector’s job
in hell.”
“Bit of a hard-case, eh?”
“Look, mate, he’s that hard
Nick uses blokes like him to
rebrick his firebox with. And
that ain’t kiddin’. I got a lot of
sympathy for y’, mate. But
the best I can do is offer you
some breakfast. There’s ’taters
’n’ pork-chops. That’ll put some
stuffin’ into you.”
Mick’s mouth watered. Next
to Joe’s beer, ’taters fried in
pork-chop fat was a weakness
of his. “I’ll be in that,” he said
cheerfully.
“You follow me; then. The
path’s a bit narrow in parts.
But so far we ain’t lost anybody
off it.”
Mick got out of the truck.
He guessed this bloke must be
Abe Jacobs,, there being only the
two consumers up in this part of
the shire. Jacobs began to climb
a ladder; and, as he followed,
Mick could feel the ladder sway-
ing and bucketing about as if it
was loose from old age on its
fixings. After half-an-hour’s
climbing they stepped on to a
ledge on which was Jacobs’s
house.
Mick stopped for a breather
and had a look about. There
wasn’t much to be seen in the
gloom. But light was beginning
to filter into the chasm. Mick
was a bit surprised. It had been
half-past-eight in the morning
when he’d left Deadandgone, and
by his watch it was now ten-
thirty and the day just
piccaninny-dawn with the air
sharp as ice. He refrained from
comment other than to remark,
“You’ve some nice White
Leghorns up there, Mister
Jacobs.”
Jacobs glanced up the sheer
cliff to where some fowls roosted
on outcrops. “Them’s Black
Orpingtons,” he said tersely.
Mick took another look, but
didn’t say anything. Perhaps, he
thought, this air’s playing tricks
with me eyesight.
A FTER breakfast the two men
stood out ort the ledge again
and Mick took another gander
up at the fowls. There was a
bit more light and warmth in the
valley now the sun was getting
on towards the zenith and the
fowls were nearly thawed-out of
the 1 night’s frost. They were
Black Orpingtons all right.
Rather subdued, Mick remarked
that he’d better be shoving along
as he was interested in taking a
look at the Black Stump that
he’d been hearing about for
years and never yet set eyes on.
“Oh, she’s there, all right,”
Jacobs assured him. “Round
the back of the house near the
chimney. She’s, a real dinky-di
pearl. A fair dinkum blackbutt,
pure Merino ’n’ a yard wide.
But be careful, mate. That
Genevieve’s man-hungry, and if
old Blatherskite catches you
talkin’ to her without him being
about then you’re a dead duck.”
He brightened suddenly. “I
tell you what, mate, if you ain’t
passed by here on y’r way out
by sundown I’ll send out an’ get
a real dinkum headstone for you.
There’s still a bit of room left
in the cemetery, ’n’ I haven’t
had a day off for the last six
months.”
A little over an hour later the
road came to an abrupt end.
There were now three sheer rock-
walls to stop his progress. Mick
turned the truck about and got
out. The light was pretty good
now it was almost boon. Peer-
ing about, he spied Price’s house
away up to billy-oh, perched on
a ledge somewhat like Jacobs’s.
But there was no ladder here;
just a series of iron steps driven
into the sheer rock. With the
D.O. for non-payment gripped in
his teeth, Mick set off, thinking
to himself, “By heck, if that
union-bloke was to set eyes on
me right now there’d be old-
Harry to pay! Me without a
bodybelt an’ no mate at the foot
of the ladder!”
The iron steps were thick with
frost and after a while Mick’s
hands were numb and his breath
hung like a cloud in front of his
face. But he kept going; he
reckoned he had a j6b to do and
he’d see it to its end or bust.
A long While later he crawled
over the lip of the ledge, panting
and feeling somewhat gone in
the knees, and arms. He sat on
the rim of the ledge to regain
breath, and every time he looked
down he became giddy at the
immense distance beneath his
feet.
A sweet, soft, enthralled voice
in his ear said, “C . . . oo! A
strange man ... !”
Mick looked up sharply, the
butterflies beating their wings
frantically against the walls of
his stomach. It was Genevieve
all right and, fair dinkum, she
was a justification to the eye of
the beholder.
The girl looked over the edge.
“Oh . . . !” she breathed
excitedly. “A County Council
man, and not that silly old meter-
reader! How nice!”
Mick took a quick look over,
too. All that he could see of
his truck was a tiny yellow blob
that looked anything but a truck.
He looked hard at tfye opposite
wall of the ravine and felt a
cold chill on his spine. Stone
the crows, what chance did a
man have?
He scrambled to his feet. There
was a job to be done. He
squared his shoulders and faced
about. Genevieve swayed Jike a
flower in the kitchen doorway.
Mick strode purposefully towards
her. She disappeared from
sight. He thrust his head through
the doorway and she was over
by the big wide fireplace.
“I want to see your old man,”
he said roughly.
“Dad and Mum are up in the
cowy a r d milking,” said
Genevieve coyly.
She bent down, screwed herself
around a bit and looked up the
chimney; straightened up again.
“Dad’s just turned the second
cow out. They’ll be right for
another hour at least.”
Mick swallowed hard. His
Adam’s-apple was so dry and
cranky it was as if he were
choking, and he felt waves of
hot-and-cold sweep backwards
and forwards through him like
a shuttle through a bobbin. But
he never lost sight of what he
was there for.
“Well, I want to see the
meter,” he said harshly. He
didn’t intend to sound harsh, it
was just the way the lump in his
throat was acting.
“How nicely you put things!”
Genevieve simpered, lowering
her head and flipping her eyelids
up and down. Then she flitted to
a further door.
“It’s in here. In my bedroom.”
She disappeared and Mick
could hear her singing like an
imprisoned bird welcoming the
return of spring.
It occurred to Mick suddenly
that he had an urgent appoint-
ment in Deadandgone. He went
down the steel steps so fast the
frost melted, and it rained in the
valley below for five hours after-
wards. Even then he just rifade
it. As his thumb hit the starter-
button of the truck something
cracked and splattered on the
cabiii-top. He extended a
cautious hand, ran a finger
through the mess. It was an e&g
all right; maybe ten years old.
TDURTHER down the valley
1 Mick tooted the horn to let
Jacobs know that he was on his
way out safely.
As to the 0.0. for non-
payment in his pocket ... Well,
it was a v shame, really. If the
Cosnty Council put flamin’
meters in girls’ bedrooms then
the County Council could flamin’
well read them.
Mick was damn’ certain he
wasn’t going to be up in court
for trespassing, Black Stump or
no flamin’ Black Stump.

COLLINS—PUBLISHERS
that the ancients believed that Venus
inhabited the cowries and that it was
her voice you could hear roaring—or.
as Miss Allan more poetically says,
murmuring—when you put the shell to
your ear. The Athenians used cowries
as ballot-balls in voting; the Italians
used them for burnishing paper or iron-
ing lace; natives everywhere, of course,
have used them for decoration and for
currency; and in some parts of Africa
—obviously a strong incentive towards
starting a collection —a young wife can
be bought for 60,000 to 100,000 of the
shells.
Miss Allan writes on her shellfish
with lyrical and infectious enthusiasm
—“There is something in their smooth,
round, polished shape that makes one
want to hold them, fondle them and
learn all about them. Something in
the quiet, unaggressive way they spend
their lives that is most restful”—and
at the same time she has provided (in
a large, handsome volume) a compre-
hensive, lavishly illustrated field- and
reference-book for the amateur and the
specialist.
Australians at Large
One wonders whether Dorothy
Lucie Sanders really hopes for an
Australian circulation of her new
novel about the Montgomeries of
Pepper Tree Bay (W.A.), Waterfall
(Hodder and Stoughton), since in this
one the newly-married Sam and
Theodora go to London, accompanied,
to Theodora’s chagrin, by annoying
sister Gerry, and followed by Mania —
and the result is one of those accounts
of the terribly interesting times Aus-
tralian travellers had abroad, which
envious stay-at-home Australians have
shuddered away from and yawned
through during evenings too many to
enumerate.
Sam is studying for a university
degree in London; Gerry is invited to
the mansion of her sea-met third-
officer’s parents and shocks everyone
by offering to carry out the tea-things;
Theodora gets herself a job in a kinder-
garten and girls’ school—Mama takes
on district-nursing. Sam and Theodora
go to dinner in London with butlers
and everything; an evening reception
at Lloyds; and a royal garden-party at
Buckingham Palace; and if one does
not quite share the incredulity of the
teaching-staff at the girls’ school that a
mere infants’ teacher should be invited
to such functions, one must feel that
it is all a little overcharacteristic . . .
Nevertheless, Miss Sanders softens
the picture by putting in a background
of Sam hiring his glad-rags, and
Theodora woebegone about wearing
an unnecessary heavy woollen singlet
to the high-class dinner. There is an
intriguing picture of maidservants
making-up the ladies when they leave
the gentlemen to their after-dinner
wine; and one is suitably impressed by
Mama’s regal dealings with the
manager of a cafe into which they
have inadvertently strayed without
enough money to pay its atrocious
charges.
When they go to Ireland to see their
landed relatives the same observant eye
is at work, and with the exception of a
forced passage of the sentimental
infatuation Theodora had for an Irish
cop, it all passes off very well. Indeed,
the study of Theodora’s Awful Mistake
at the girls’ school, which lands her
into a series of embarrassing lies, and
the headmistress’s Awful Mistake
which cancels the problem, deserve a
less peripatetic novel.
Reviewed Briefly
Beyond the Black Stump: Nevil
Shute (Heinemann). A boy from Port-
land, Oregon, meets a girl from W.A.,
and her family background, outlook
and ideas surprise his folks back home
nearly as much as they will surprise
Australian readers of this book. The
boy (29 years of age) is a member of
an American unit drilling for oil at
the vast Westralian sheep-station
belonging to the girl’s father and uncle
(who might have been her father if her
mother had not changed partners). She
is a graduate of Perth University, but
seems very vague about such things as
the status of Eton, and, though she
has been educated in a convent, is
quite unconcerned about her parents’
irregular alliances. Life in the great
outback is patchily described, and the
characters are commonplace. Above
all, the plot is weak, something one
does not expect from a novel by Mr.
Shute.

Flying Saucers Come from Another
World: Jimmy Guieu (Hutchinson).
M. Guieu is unique amongst writers on
this delightful subject, so far as one
knows, in suggesting a relationship
between the pilots of flying-saucers and
the Abominable Snowman of the
Himalayas; the Snowmen, he suggests,
are degenerate descendants of the giants
who peopled the lost continent of
Goncfwana and who intermarried with
their instructors from outer space. Also
—along with many odd objects in the
sky and some little men 3ft. high—
he has a flying-saucer seen at Bowral,
“near Newcastle, N. S. Wales” (an
unusual place for Bowral to be), on
January 7, 1951, at 6 a.m.
* * * *
Waterfront: Budd Schulberg (Bodley
Head). This harsh novel of the New
York waterfront shows a tendency,
which is probably the author’s politics,
to blame the Irish and implicate their
church hierarchy in the system by
which waterfront-workers there are
cowed and milked: a gang-run union;
theft on a huge scale winked-at by
consignees who can pass on the loss
to the public in higher costs; protestors
and reformers beat flat, or, if they
persist, murdered. The story of the
young Irish boxer who is persuaded by
his fixer-brother to lure a reformer on
to a roof from which he can be pushed
to his death by gangsters is a really
powerful one; but none of the happen-
ings in this novel will surprise readers
of Fred D. Pasley’s book of the ’thirties,
“Muscling In”; and to blame the Irish
is by no means to get at the seat of the
trouble.
# * * *
Maigret’s Revolver: Georges
Simenon (Hamilton). As a detective-
story, this must be the least conclusive
of Maigret’s cases; Simenon makes
almost a stroke of virtuosity out of
tailing it off weakly. Gradually from
the Simenon-grime emerge the facts
of the case: a girl and her brother have
left their father, who is lying un-
pleasantly sick and unattended in his
Paris flat. A missing politician has last
been seen near the flat. The son has
stolen Maigret’s revolver. The poli-
tician is found dead in a trunk. The
trail leads to a voluptuous maidservant
who receives Maigret in semi-trans-
parent pyjamas in her mistress’s flat,
and then to a London hotel; and then
the story peters-out: the discovery
made, but without excitement; the final
arrest left to be worked-out in the
reader’s mind, as in a Chinese poem.

They didn’t lay a murder charge!
Nature endowed this land with life. Came the
settlers and .. . this land was murdered, perhaps
unwittingly but just the same, murdered. Faulty
land use, largely through ignorance of soil and
climate; slaughter of nature’s protection
trees, undergrowth, grasses by man, sheep
and rabbit were but a few of the weapons used.
Science knows that we live off the six inches
of topsoil which, on average, covers the earth.
Lose that precious soil and we lose the food,
clothing and housing which sustain us.
Modern scientific farming and forestry
methods ensure correct land use and help us to
keep the soil where it’s wanted, where nature
made it and placed it . . . instead of blowing or
washing it away to silt up rivers, irrigation
channels and reservoirs undoing in minutes
Nature’s work of millions of years.
Modern deep tillage implements and earth-
moving equipment are used extensively for
filling gullies; deep tilling; contour cultivation;
ripping of rabbit warrens and erosion tunnels;
building diversion banks and making grassed
waterways and dams. These tactics are helping
us to overcome the ravaging of wind and water.
Caterpillar-built Tractors, Motor Graders
and Earthmoving Equipment are applied by soil
conservation services and successful farmers to
these soil conserving purposes, because of their
proven capabilities in this field.
