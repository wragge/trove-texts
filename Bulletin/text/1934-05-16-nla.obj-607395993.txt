When its a Crime . . .

If ever pipes are prohibited and "no smoking” made law—we Private Seal smokers
will spend most of our time in jail. Thousands of us would be found in unlawful
possession of pipes .. , the police courts would overflow with those of us caught
red-handed in the act of enjoying our joy-smoke.
And no wonder. Private Seal gets a grip on your smoking affection that nothing can
shake. Get one whiff of that aroma —appetising overture to what’s ahead. Take one
deep draught of its bland, benevolent goodness. Get one taste of that sweet, satisfying
flavour . . . smoke one fill to its cool, comforting close—then leave it if you can!
Every pipeful will tighten the bond between you and Private Seal—its dependability

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has real worth is that which' is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

HIS
BOOKS
In the Light of Reason
Ilere are two books which.are more
nesting as mental exercises than any
nber of mystery novels or crossword
:zles. In Is the Resurrection True?
ilip Allan ; 55.), D. F. Brundrit exam-
s a fundamental of the Christian reli-
n from the standpoint of “a lawyer
ustomed to sift evidence in detail and
w conclusions from it.” He is attached
no church. Gilbert Slater, in Seven
ikspeares (Cecil Palmer; 7s. 6d.),
ues that Shakspeare never existed as a
ious playwright; that his works' were
itten by “ghosts.”
’re the Disciples Frauds ?
\ll Mr. Brundrit takes for granted is
.t Christ is not a myth, as rationalists
; J. M. Robertson (“The Historical
us”) contend. At the outset he neither
lies with the modernists .that Christ
s “God made man,” nor affirms it as
hodox Christians do. The Resurrection
i key test. He quotes from Paul’s letter
his converts at Corinth: “If Christ has
t been raised then is our preaching
in and your faith also in vain.”
He sums up the evidence like a
dge. Clearly at a certain stage
; eleven disciples became convinced
it the Saviour had risen. In the Garden
Gethsemane they had “left Him and
d” (Matthew and Mark); in the high
iest’s house Peter had denied Him (“I
ow not the man of whom ye speak”),
lly John had the courage to face the
rcifixion. They dispersed satisfied,
parently, that “Jesus and His cause had
ne down in defeat.” Then something
nnendous happened. They came out of
sir hiding-places and began to preach
tie risen Lord” with fanatical indiffer-
ce to the consequences —such indiffer-
ce that all but John eventually met
violent deaths.
Unquestionably the change was caused
by the reappearance, real or imagined, of
the Saviour. Was it magic—a sort of
Indian rope trick? It has often been
pointed out that no reliable witness has
seen the rope trick done ; all the evi-
dence comes from people who were told
about it. The disciples were by no means
prepared to be deceived. “Except I shall
see in His hands the print of the nails,”
said Thomas, “and put my finger into
the print of the nails and put my hand
into His side, I will not believe.”
So the disciples either believed they
Iliad seen the Saviour after the third day,
or they were impostors who conspired to
spread a faked story. The Saviour may
have been got down from the cross be-
fore death, or His body may have been
disposed of in some way afterwards.
In the event of death it would have been
necessary to steal the body from the
tomb. If it had been left disbelievers
would have said: “Look at your Messiah,
you frauds, whom you say God has
raised from the dead!” In either case
all the women followers would have had
to be admitted to the plot.
Mr. Brundrit rejects the hypothesis of
fraud, not only because everything goes
to show that the disciples were psycho-
logically unprepared for the Resurrection,
but also because it would have been im-
possible to keep such a sensational
swindle secret for any length of time.
There were too many in it. His con-
clusion is that it is easier for one in the
habit of weighing evidence to believe than
to disbelieve the New Testament story
—a conclusion which was come to on
I much the same lines by W. E. Gladstone,
Lord Chief Justice Russell and Pascal.
S
'Shakspeare as a Composite
Professor Slater’s basic reason for re-
jecting the traditional view of Shak-
speare’s identity is that “it demands our
acceptance of two psychological miracles,
first, the transformation of the Stratford
youth into the cultured poet of aristo-
cratic outlook, and, second, his retrans-
formation into the Stratford bourgeois
magnate.”
Noel Coward’s origin was humbler
than Shakspeare’s, and he didn’t even
have a grammar-
school education.
At 35 he is amus-
ing London so-
ciety with mod-
ern versions of
the works which
Shakspeare was giving London at the
same age—dramas, society comedies, fan-
tasies and patriotic propaganda plays.
He is not comparable to Shakspeare as a
writer, but then his public is not com-
parable to Shakspeare’s in education and
intelligence. Elizabethan Court circles
didn’t fault Shakspeare’s portraits of
royalties and aristocrats, and Georgian
Court circles don’t fault Coward’s por-
traits. Shakspeare wrote with uncanny
exactitude about countries he had never
seen (e.g., Italy), and Coward has written
with similar exactitude about war-time
conditions of which he knows nothing
except by hearsay. Some people (say
one in a billion) can do it; Gautier wrote
“Mademoiselle de Maupin” at 24.
There was no psychological miracle
about Shakspeare’s contented return to
Stratford when most of his London
friends were dead, and a new generation
had appeared at Court; such a man
would have been as happy in one circle
as in another. It is said, incidentally,
that Coward is.
Professor Slater contends —because of
the knowledge of Courts, foreign lands
and such diverse subjects as law, warfare
and art shown in the plays and poetry
ascribed to Shakspeare —that the writer
was not even Bacon, much less De Vere,
but a syndicate of seven. One was Mary,
Countess of Pembroke. Rosalind was
a self-portrait; Cleopatra and Lady Mac-
beth were also essentially feminine crea-
tions. Jonson had been inclined to sneer
at the young interloper from Stratford ;
he said in 1619 that Shakspeare “wanted
arte.” Two years later the MSS. pf the
plays “were put into his hands, and he
learnt that many of them were largely
the work of his esteemed friend and
patroness” (i.e., the Countess of Pem-
broke). Immediately “his old feeling of
jealous rivalry gave way to one of en-
thusiastic appreciation.” He referred to
Shakspeare as “the sweet Swan of Avon.”
Such a theory seems to show total
ignorance of human nature. Could any-
thing likelier to madden Jonson have
been devised than the news that his rival,
the man he had first disliked and then
got to know and admire, was a vulgar
fraud whose plays and poems were being
written for him by Bacon, De Vere, Lady
Pembroke, Marlowe, the Earl of Derby,
Sir Walter Raleigh and the Earl of Rut-
land?
Elizabethan society was perhaps the
most literate, brilliant and talkative that
England has known, and the stage Was
one of its chief subjects of conversation.
Further, the theatre was the only vehicle
for war propaganda at the disposal of.
the Government. Yet Professor Slater
asks us to believe that in this malicious
and gossiping age at least a dozen
people engaged in a plot to foist a
moron on their friends and on the
Queen, not only as a public enter-
tainer, but as a valuable servant of the
State; and got away with it to such
purpose that no hint on the subject has
appeared in print till the present cen-
tury! It is even harder to swallow than
the theory about a similarly pointless
conspiracy among the disciples which is
demolished in the other book.

incongruous gentility, in the shape of
Mission Houses, Elk Clubs and Sewing
Societies.
Nature alone was unchanged: the
winters were as bitter, the springs
and summers as lovely, the rivers as
swift-running and treacherous. It is in
the description of outdoor scenes that
G. B. Lancaster is at her best. The
reader feels that she has tramped the
very hills she describes, paddled up the
Kanana and Kluane, explored dead and
forgotten Aroya, picked saskatoons on
lonely trails.
She knows her people, too. There are
girls like Tamsin MacDonald in our
bush: splendid creatures with healthy
bodies and minds, and a capacity for
sacrifice. Kirk Regard is another good
bit of work. A restless, brooding fellow,
with strong likes and dislikes, and a
free-and-easy way with women, he is
haunted by a past crime. Tamsin’s
father, an upright Scot who never for-
gives or forgets, yet is most men’s
friend, stands out clearly ; so does old
Mat Colom, a reformed saloon-keeper,
who expounds a muddled philosophy
concocted from half-digested fragments
from the Bible, Butler and Blake. There
are also Rab Stewart, the dried-up, sensi-
tive telegraph-operator; Challis, the
mounted policeman, who has little else
to do but bury dead Indians and put out
fires ; O’Kane, a decaying intellectual.
The story moves leisurely, as life does
in that vast expanse of sparsely populated
country. Yet it never drags, for as it
advances it continually opens up new
scenes of interest. The manner in which
Miss Lancaster blends the human ele-
ment with the countryside is reminiscent
of Hardy. In this work you cannot dis-
connect man from his surroundings, and
it seems appropriate at the end that, in
the windy Carcoss cemetery, the earth
which they loved should receive Kirk
and Tamsin.
LIAM MAC EANRUIG.
The Latest Style
Universal education seems to have
evolved an appropriate art-form. “Caval-
cade” was an example. The countless
millions who are capable of being
worked up to a high pitch of enthusiasm
by ballyhoo about Janet Gaynor, Mary
Pickford, Prince George or Prince Henry,
as the case may be, cheered and wept at
the war sequences ; the thousands who,
like Noel Coward, are anti-militarists and
deriders of Victorian and Edwardian
conventions regarded both play and film
as devastating satire. So the clever young
writer backed a winner both ways, secur-
ing the appreciation of the eclectic few
as well as the cash of the many.
Naomi Royde-Smith has just played
a similar trick on a public which is
divided into students of moron news-
papers (90 p.c.) and of other newspapers
(10 p.c.). Her medium is The Queen’s
Wigs (Gollancz ; 7s. 6d.). If you belong
to the vast army of Rurimaniacs you
will palpitate deliciously at the emo-
tional and other adventures of the sweet
little schoolgirl, Angelina Rose Elizabeth
Haverford-Merton, who is whisked from
a dull game of hockey at Ditchampton
House to Irolya and the most luscious
luxury hotel on earth. Here she catches
her first glimpse of the Crown Prince in his
Russian leather topboots ; aye, “and the
day was to come when Rozel would
know the faint aromatic trace left on
the air when the wearer of those pale,
silver-spurred boots had passed, and to
believe that from her first sight of him,”
etc., etc.
The stupefied virgin forgets all “in
contemplation of the most magnificent
human being she had ever seen.”
A blue cloth helmet, with ear-pieces on
which two silver wings folded backwards
from the temples, fitted closely to the head.
The color of the helmet matched that of
the eyes which looked out with half un-
conscious arrogance a small military
moustache.... collar and huge gloves of fine
grey astrachan fur coat fastened to one
shoulder with a loop and bar of grey silk
braid Ice-blue, mist-grey he stood,
cold and yet ardent with the invisible flame
of living.
His behavior and conversation are as
consistently inane as his clothes are
gorgeous, but then so are the behavior
and conversation of the other characters.
Rozel doesn’t marry him —she marries
another phenomenon who on the last
page speaks in tones “like the deepest
utterance of a nightingale.”
An interesting feature of this novel is
that you can either be thrilled to the
marrow by its splendor or diverted by
its bathos. It is at one and the same
time moving romance and merciless
satire. Thousands of authors have dealt
in one or other of these brands; it
has taken the cynical nineteen-thirties to
produce a blend.
D.
The Lights of London
Both “1.L.” and P. R. Stephensen seem
to me to be at sea regarding Australian
writers. “1.L.” thinks there was some-
thing “fine” about the pioneer work of
George Robertson in the local publish-
ing field. It was business. Publishing
often pays in conjunction with retailing
organisations. The Bookstall Co. must
have made small fortunes in the past 30
years out of Norman Lindsay’s “Curate
in Bohemia,” the adventure books of
Jack McLaren and the sporting stories
of Con Drew. Angus and Robertson has
had many winners. The works of lon
Idriess have been best-sellers for years,
and now comes Dr. Angus’s apologia,
which is being rushed by the religious
and irreligious alike.
The few duds can’t have cost the
firms responsible much in the long <un ;
what was lost in the sales-swings would
have been made up in the publicity-
roundabouts. When an edition goes cold
on a sole publisher he only has the re-
mainder-men to fall back on; a pub-
lisher-bookseller can act as his own
remainder-man, with fairly satisfactory
results as a rule.
Mr. Stephensen’s “indictment,” as he
calls it, is that Henry Handel Richard-
son, Helen Simpson, Jack Lindsay, Philip
Lindsay and the rest left Australia, and
are still abroad, because of Australia’s
lack of intelligent publishers.
Was the abandonment of their own coun-
try by most of the writers mentioned such
a haphazard matter as “1.L.” suggests?
Did they leave it because they wanted a
holiday? And, if so, why did they remain
in London?
They certainly didn’t go because they
wanted to publish books in London.
They could have done that from Aus-
tralia, as Roy Bridges, Vance Palmer
and many more are doing.
The mission of Mr. Stephensen, it
seems, is “to make Australia a country
that can publish them” (i.e., their works).
I don’t quite know what this means;
but, whatever changes he institutes, they
won’t bring a single absentee back.
It may be upsetting to our national
self-esteem, but the fact is almost every-
body in the English-speaking world —
America included —with anything of
artistic value to sell goes sooner or later
to London, and, if he or she can manage
it, stays there. The Bulletin has given
as much encouragement to black-and-
white artists as any paper in the world,
but it couldn’t hold Phil May or Low ;
couldn’t hold them though it was ready
to outbid in terms of mere money the
London papers that were after them.
No amount of financial or other encour-
agement would have kept* say, James
Quinn, and all the encouragement in the
world won’t bring, say, Mrs. Dod Proctor
back. They have made niches for them-
selves abroad, like hundreds of other
Australians with unique brains or unique
tricks —actors and playwrights, cari-
caturists and portrait painters, singers,
composers and pianists, dramatic and
musical critics, doctors, diplomatists and
politicians —and if they return it will only
be for trips, or because they are begin-
ning to feel uncertain of their niches, or
because, like Melba, they want to die at
home.
Our literary exiles are remaining in
London for reasons entirely unconnected
with novel-writing—a far from lucrative
calling, by the way, in the case of about
90 per cent, of those who practise it.
Jack and Philip Lindsay have acquired
niches in the film business. Helen Simp-
son is married to a London doctor.
H. H. Richardson writes short stories
for weeklies like the . “Nation and
Athenaeum,” and in any event she
is no more interested in Australia
’ now than W. J. Turner, who, like
her, was at school in Melbourne.
A time came when members of the
Greek intelligentsia would take almost
any job in Rome for the pleasure and
prestige of living there. Modern London
resembles the Rome of the Empire. It
is the centre of the world, and there is
nothing any Sydney publisher can do
about it at present.
J. D.
The Modern Muse
The Modern Muse (The English Asso-
ciation ; Oxford University Press; 55.)
contains Poems of To-day, British and
American. “The Anthology is intended
to exhibit the range and variety of poetry
among contemporary writers of English
throughout the world. While a standard
of excellence has been kept in mind, the
main aim has been to make the selection
fully representative of the various coun-
tries.”
It rather takes the wind out of the
reviewer’s sails. How does “The Hound
of Heaven” become verse contemporary
with James Joyce’s “Tutto e Sciolto”?
The answer is obvious: because the
anthology-makers considered the works
contemporary. Australia being repre-
sented by Christopher Brennan, Hugh
McCrae, Le Gay Brereton, Frank Wil-
mot and others, one may ask why, in
contemporary representative verse, there
is no David McKee Wright, Henry Law-
son or Llywellyn Lucas. Do the com-
pilers mean representative of the coun-
try? Obviously not; because, if so, why
Brennan and Hugh McCrae, whose work
is as much Saskatchewan as Australia?
If, as should be the case, it is the coun-
try’s poetic thought that is represented,
then Miss Lucas, David Wright and
Lawson should all be there.
In “standard of excellence” the collec-
tion is fine. Flecker, the Sitwells, Vachel
Lindsay, the war-poets, Housman, Edna
Millay—the range is wide and the selec-
tions are good. Of our own people
Brennan’s magnificent “O Desolate Eves
along the Way, how oft” sings its major
song, and McCrae’s “Witless Boy” and
“Fantasy” their secret magic; H. M.
Green’s “Enchanted Orchard” hums its
rich drowsy music. A dozen Aus-
tralians and Maorilanders contribute
good examples. In fact, a first-rate col-
lection for the bookshelf or the pocket.

A Satchel of Books
Bessie the ’Bus, by Biddy Worger
(Sampson Low ; Angus and Robertson ;
7s. 6d.), has provided the plot for
“Friday, the 13th,” now being screened
at Sydney Prince Edward. It begins with
Cockney backchat between the ’bus-
driver and his conductor, and ends with
an accident, but most of the intervening
episodes are different. They’re all nice
Londoners of the poor or near-poor
classes, and they have hardly a complex
between them.
Our gory-minded old friend W. C.
Tuttle is on the trail again with Horse
Shoe Luck (Collins; 7s. 6d.). Albert La
Rue is the villain of this one. He first
falsified Marion’s daddy’s books, and then
disappeared. In her poignant phrase to
the coroner at Stillwell’s inquest, “They
sent daddy to the penitentiary for ten
years.” Need we say that it was Albert
who, disguised by another name, shot
Stillwell or that he got his in the end?
Well up to the standard of a writer who
will yet earn for himself the title of the
Balzac of the Bad Lands.
Blood in the Mists, by John Halpin
(Macquarie Head Press ; 65.), is an extra-
ordinary production. The author, a
Light Horse n.c.0., was captured by the
Turks towards the end of the war. He
relates his experiences with painful senti-
mentality, and in a tortured style which
is all his own. He bayoneted his first
German near Gaza.
My man. He gazes at me glassily from
out those paling features... .German....
white, like mine, like the Christ’s when
wracked with pain.... and His prayer—
“ They know not what they do.” I bare my
head and sink forward with a sobbing plea
—“Father, forgive me.”
I kiss his brow.
Now and then in a surging ocean of
bathos a brilliant phrase appears. Of
a Home Service mess full of self-
invalided officers, for example: “This
haven of bloodless heroism.” But most
of it is dull, chiefly because it is hard to
distinguish his story from the breathless
polysyllables with which he surrounds it.
The May issue- of the Home is
mostly concerned with interior decora-
tion. There is photographic evidence
that one member of Sydney’s old nobility
has brought back from London a “gay
Prince of Wales cocktail bar which
opens and closes like a wardrobe trunk.”
The advantage of these bars is that, like
wardrobe trunks, they don’t have to close
at 6 p.m. C. H. Bertie writes of Mel-
bourne Bohemia in the days of Marcus
Clarke and Adam Lindsay Gordon ; Tom
Cochrane has a bright interview with Sir
Hamilton Harty, the conductor; and
Derek Patmore unleashes some deep new
thoughts about Noel Coward. For
example: “Undoubtedly, Noel Coward’s
lifelong association with the stage has
helped him enormously in playwriting” ;
and, even profounder, “He is certainly
one of the most remarkable young men
of his period.”
The Knife, by Herbert Adams (Col-
lins ; 7s. 6d.), contains a financier.
He is said to be worth millions. He
is in Parliament and everyone supposes he
will get a baronetcy or a peerage before
long.
Also a country doctor.
Just thirty years of age, with strong clear-
cut features and dark eyes, Mark Braddon
had been too intent on his profession to
give much thought to marriage.
Then Ruth came into his life. How
Malden decided to possess Ruth, how the
knife of the title was inserted with fatal
effect in the blameless eye of Ruth’s
uncle, how the fiance of Ruth’s sister
came to be suspected, and how Mark
nearly perished in an ingenious oubliette
devised by the villain, whose identity
you will no doubt have guessed ere this
—these are some of the features of a
thriller which should make a first-class
ooh.-ooh film.

THE WAR DEBTS AGAIN.
Britain made a token payment to its
American creditor last June, and another
in December. Mr. Roosevelt accepted
the first in a charming spirit, going out
of his way to say that it did not amount
to default, although Mr. Beasley and
other eminent Langsters gloatingly pro-
claimed that it did. The President was
doubtless influenced by what Senator
Glass, whom he had invited to be Sec-
retary of the Treasury, had told him
about Britain’s difficulties, which com-
pelled it to go off the gold standard ; re-
turning to the subject when his country
(unwarrantably, in his opinion) had done
likewise, the Senator pointed out that
“Britain had had less than a million dol-
lars in gold left after paying its indebted-
ness to the United States.”
When the second token payment ar-
rived the President made no recorded
comment, but his Attorney-General an-
nounced, doubtless with his chief’s ap-
proval, that it was not a case of default.
The atmosphere has since changed.
There is a law, passed at the instance of
a Republican Senator, one Hiram John-
son, forbidding Americans to have finan-
cial dealings with debtor-nations in de-
fault. It was aimed at France, but is
capable of being used to hit Britain-
Envy has been excited among the Ameri-
cans (especially the anti-British ele-
ments) by the British surplus for
1933-34, which they contrast with
their immense deficit. A Congressional
election is due in a few months. With
their eyes on the constituencies, Con-
gressmen forced the President to aban-
don his plans for reducing expenditure
on Spanish-American war pensions and
Federal officers’ salaries, passing a law
over his veto in the process of making
a hash of his Budget; and he is obvi-
ously in no mood for another trial of
strength.
The next war-debts payments are due
on June 15. One of the Washington
correspondents who besiege the White
House wrote last week that “Britain and
other debtor-nations must pay their in-
stalments in full, or stand in default
within the meaning of the Johnson Act.”
Mr. Hiram Johnson declared himself
“perfectly certain that token payments
will not be accepted by our Govern-
ment,” and that “nations which have not
paid their debt commitments in full will
be placed in the category of defaulters
after June 15.” Some days elapsed;
then Mr. Roosevelt said: “The United
States stands for the collection of war
debts, but will grant a hearing to nations
in distress who may ask to be allowed
to make reduced payments.”
It is thought in America that Britain
will refuse to appear in the character of
a nation “in distress,” and will pay in
full rather than be branded as a de-
faulter. This is very likely, for Father
Bull is a proud old person and extremely
sensitive where his financial reputation is
concerned —more so, it would seem, than
the present rulers of the United States.
On this score the ordinarily sober “Satur-
day Evening Post” has been publishing
horrible things about them. For example:
Responding to the wishes of the Adminis-
tration, Congress repudiated the gold
clause in every form of public and private
contract.... You cannot imagine Congress
passing a law to say: “One-half of the
total national debt is hereby repudiated in
the public interest.” Yet that is the mean-
ing of the two laws it did pass, one author-
ising the President to cheapen the dollar
one-half, and the other repudiating the
clause “payable in gold coin of the present
standard of value” engraved on every Gov-
ernment obligation prior to last June.
Senator Glass has been quoted as say-
ing, with reference to the debasing of the
dollar, that “it means national repudia-
tion and dishonor” ; but no other mem-
ber of the Democratic party seems to
have turned a hair.
After the June payment, it was cal-
culated that Britain owed the U.S.A.
£757,600,000. Along with its Allies, it
received £625,000,000 from Germany be-
fore that country gave up paying repara-
tions ; it has handed over all its share
to the Americans and upwards of
£200.000,000 besides. Including post-
Armistice loans, it and its Allies bor-
rowed from Uncle Sam a total of
£1,949,600,000, which was £423,800,000
less than the amount of their purchases—
and they had to pay through the nose for
everything they got —in the lender’s coun-
try. In the settlements arrived at, Uncle
was comparatively lenient to France (now
in default) and Italy, remitting to the
French, at 1933 values, £400,000,000 out
of £805,000,000 borrowed, and to the
Italians £303,000,000 out of £408,000,000.
But of £922,000,000 borrowed by Britain
he wiped off only £162,400,000.
The Democratic President is facing a
sea of troubles, and it is perhaps natural
that his mouth should water when he
thinks that Britain wound up 1933-34
£31,000,000 to the good. But if he decides
to be greedy and to have no thought for
other people’s troubles (there are still
1,750,000 Britons on the dole) his country
may lose more than it can gain. It will
certainly lose trade in large quantities.
For instance, if Father Bull is pressed too
hard he is sure to remind Australia that
it still owes him 80 millions of war debt
and ask for resumption of the annual
payments, together with something on
account of the interest suspended during
the Hoover moratorium and since, or a
satisfactory equivalent. And Australia
will certainly reply (being anxious, for
other reasons connected with trade,
to strike a friendly bargain with
Father) that it hasn’t the money but
will let Dad have, the lion’s share of
its import trade with Uncle. This was
worth £30,316,200 in 1929-30. There is
always a substantial balance (£4,545,500
worth in 1932-33) in Uncle’s favor, and
most of it could be transferred to the
Old Man without hardship or difficulty.
THE DIGGER’S LANDLORD.
“Efficiency, sympathy and economy”
are the ideals of the War Service Homes
Commission, according to its latest
annual report. Sympathy is doubtless
felt, but has not been conspicuously
shown. Economy may have been prac-
tised, but not, generally speaking, in the
purchase of land or in the erection of
homes. If the commission has been effi-
cient, it has merely been- as a collecting
agent.
In the years before the rearrangement
of 1921, the war-service-homes business
smelt to Heaven. The report of the
Public Accounts Committee of the Com-
monwealth Parliament in 1921 reads like
a revelation of a Mississippi land scandal.
In Newcastle, for instance, the commis-
sion bought for £BlOO land which, im-
provements included, had cost its owner
£2600 the previous year. On that land,
“which was flat, low-lying and subject to
flooding after heavy rain,” 65 houses
were run up. An “efficient” officer had
pronounced it “excellent for building pur-
poses —healthy in situation, very dry and
in a popular residential area.” When the
chief inspector of the Public Works
Department went to have a look,
there were nine inches of water on the
whole of it and I couldn’t get nearer than
100 feet.
At Goulburn, the commission built
at the foot of a steep hill, and the houses
showed “poor-quality material and gross
departures from specification.” At Cess-
nock, the timber of the homes was found
to be “very inferior —full of shakes and
flaws and badly infected with borers.”
One residence had been handed over
without a fence, with the gates lying in
the wash-house.
Paint could be rubbed off the verandahs
with the hands, and the inside timber was
badly infested with borers.
Hunter’s Hill Council refused to allow
war-service cottages to be occupied until
radically altered. From other quarters in
various parts of the Commonwealth
came complaints of wretched materials,
bought at prices so extortionate that when
soldiers got their ramshackle edifices
their application estimates were vastly ex-
ceeded. During a lull in the build-
ing period there was a tempest of
disputes. At one time writs for over
£60,000 were out against the commission
on behalf of contractors. On disposals
of extravagantly bought materials, one
Public Accounts Committee report alone
shows losses of £343,000 ; compensation
paid to contractors in a single year was
£161,000.
The Commonwealth Bank had set
up a building branch in competi-
tion with the commission—it was the
one serious mistake of Denison Miller’s
career —and had, in effect, to be bought
out. Before the commission was reor-
ganised it was acknowledged by the
Bruce-Page Government that nearly
£2,000,000 of good borrowed money had
been wasted in bungling and worse.
The present commission is not to
blame for what went on in those wild
years, and perhaps it could not be ex-
pected to foresee (though others did) that
the boom would not last. But its annual
report is a smug and self-satisfied docu-
ment. It has been “efficient” in col-
lecting from depression-ridden occupants
of boom-time shacks (it charges com-
pound interest on arrears); but it has not
been nearly so clever in selling homes
which have fallen back on its hands. The
Auditor-General drily mentions that, ex-
clusive of dwellings under the control of
the South Australian Government, there
were, on June 30, 1765 of these, 390
being vacant. Says the commission:
. Endeavors to obtain purchasers for re-
verted homes have been continued. A
general disinclination to enter into long-
term engagements on account of unsettled
conditions and the absence of a fixed basis
of value have unfortunately exerted a con-
siderable influence.
It speaks volumes for the honesty of
the Digger that, of £14,776,220 of instal-
ments due at June 30, £14,081,887 had
been paid. It is expected of him that,
once in a war-service home, however in-
flated the valuation, there he must stop
till he pays the last farthing. Property
values have fallen perhaps 70 per cent,
in some of the neighborhoods in which
the commission built; but the official
viewpoint is that the buyer should
have known that. The best that
has been done for him is an interest
reduction of 1 p.c. If he wishes to sell
his equity for what he can get, he is apt
to be told in these days that he may
not do so—if there, is any selling to be
done, the department will do it. His job
is to sit tight during the commission’s
pleasure and go on paying—unless, as
occasionally happens, the foundations
crack under him and the walls begin to
buckle. Then -he has a legal loophole
of escape. It would pay the ex-warrior
in many instances to rent his war-service
home at 12s. 6d. a week, as many civi-
lians are doing, but he is denied a privi-
lege freely accorded to non-starters.
A case was quoted in the House of
Representatives last session of a Digger
who desired to leave the district because
his wife had died and his children were
ailing. His increments were paid up to
date, and he explained the circumstances.
But he had shattered one of the cher-
ished ideals ; and he was sued.
Even at the depth of the depression,
when hundreds of w.-s. homes stood
vacant and dilapidated, it needed a re-
port by a soldiers’ committee to secure
a reduction of compulsory payments off
the principal; and the relief was not
substantial. If a Digger, through unem-
ployment, eventually finds himself unable
to continue the payments, he is evicted.
That stage generally comes when he is
£l2O in arrears. What follows was told
by Mr. A. K. Flack at the Returned Sol-
diers’ conference in Sydney last year:
In my area there are 100 empty war-ser-
vice homes —16 in one street; 12 in two
others. In 75 per cent, of them there is
not a window. People have been known
to enter them and carry off stoves, baths
and whatever else they can get hold of.
In a few cases every available fitting has
been removed. Sometimes fences have been
taken.... The cause is the eviction of
unemployed Diggers and the inability of
the commission to secure other tenants.
Presumably the evicted Diggers are
homeless in one of the Happy Valleys
which disfigure the suburbs of Sydney, or
living on the charity of private landlords.
The commission is too “efficient” to see
that it would be better business to stand
behind these people until good times
return than to deprive them of their
equities and have the houses stolen piece-
meal as they stand unoccupied.
Much of the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment’s time is taken up in listening to
w.-s.-homes complaints, nor are they
limited to one side. Mr. Lane, the
U.A.P. member for Barton, for instance,
said last session that the department had
“developed into a large real-estate busi-
ness.... it is demanding its pound of
flesh all the time.” He accused the Gov-
ernment which he supports of driving
occupants into the hands of money-
lenders, and demanded a more sym-
pathetic outlook.
It was a mild statement of the case.
The time has arrived when war-service-
homes purchasers should be placed in
the same position as soldier-settlers and
given the right to apply for revaluation
of their properties in the light of altered
conditions—the right also to get back
a fair proportion of what they have paid
in if circumstances compel them to quit.
“HONORS.”
According to a cable of last week, “the
M.B.E. has been awarded to Major
Brett and Captain Deedes for conspicu-
ous bravery in the recent attack by Indian
Terrorists.”
The M.B.E. is held by scores in Aus-
tralia, and by thousands in the U.K., who
were never within miles of a danger zone.
It was an issue decoration during the
war for base adjutants and Red Crossers.
But all the service decorations, except
the V.C. and the D.C.M., have been
trailed in the mud. A writer in a British
service paper estimated recently that, for
every two D.S.Os. awarded for work in
the field in the World War, five were
awarded for office work.
The surest way to get an important de-
coration during an Empire war is to stick
to office work. But this manoeuvre won’t
produce results if the work causes abuses
to be shown up, and thereby casts reflec-
tion on officers of high rank or on poli-
ticians, or if it is so brilliant as to
diminish the importance of influential
office men by comparison. Lieut.-Colonel
Carter, who deserved nothing less than
a statue for revealing the hospital condi-
tions of the Mesopotamia campaign, re-
tired the other day, after quarter of a
century in the 1.M.5., with a rank
but one step higher than the one he
was holding when he made his exposures.
He got his solitary military decoration
(a C. 8.) after a campaign by the Norlh-
cliffe press. Stokes invented a gun in
1915 which solved a major problem for
the Allies, and saved tens of thousands
of soldiers’ lives. It was two years before
a K.B.E. was tossed to him. Scores of
profiteers had got it in the meantime.
In Australia, for every knighthood
which is given to a man who has done
something for the country (Kingsford
Smith, for example), ten are given to
politicians and their friends. Nearly all
those who won high rank in the A.I.F.
conceal it, and their decorations, nowa-
days ; a system under which M.B.Es. are
awarded to combatant officers for bravery
and K.B.Es. to officers in charge of
munition jobs has made military
“honors” ridiculous.
Australia would acquire prestige all
over the world if it put a sudden end to
the swindle. Every important country
except England has done so already, and
even in England those of first importance
shun titles. Titles are good enough for
provincial mayors, but no good to Kip-
ling, Shaw, Masefield or Wells; Baldwin,
Churchill or our own Bruce. Though
“honors lists” form a stock subject for
jokes in England, it might not be prac-
tical politics there to abolish them, apart
from the fact that Britain’s second
Chamber is traditionally titled. The
Government issues titles in peace-time
(the part played in the business by the
Crown is, of course, nominal) for the
following reasons:
(1) In consideration of payments made to
party funds. It was revealed during the in-
quiry started some years ago by Lord Salis-
bury and Lord Selborne that fixed sums
are charged for hereditary titles, beginning
with £15,000 for a baronetcy; knighthoods
are, of course, cheaper. Eighty per cent,
of all new hereditary titles are said to be
party awards.
(2) For large donations to public objects.
Here, notoriously, a saleable article is often
thrown away. The donation would have
been made, anyhow.
(3) For services to the State. Under this
heading come knighthoods for Judges, re-
corders, etc.; admirals and generals;
writers like Barrie (but not like Aldous
Huxley); popular sculptors, but not sculp-
tors like Epstein; and so on.
(4) To inspire loyalty to the Crown, the
nominal repository of all honors.
In Australia only one of the two great
parties now recommends its supporters
for titles. So, to put the matter on the
lowest grounds, it is unfair that anti-
Labor should have a means of raising
money which Labor is debarred by its
principles from exploiting. The number
of people in this country likely to be in-
spired to give large sums to public
objects by the possibility of being recom-
mended for a title is even smaller, rela-
tively to population, than in England.
In any case, the prospect of a title has
never produced bequests in England or
Europe which can be compared with
those of the U.S.A., whose Carnegies and
Rockefellers are not given titles. In Aus-
tralia, under the heading “services to the
State,” a few Judges, doctors and news-
paper magnates, and an occasional artist
like Longstaff, have been knighted ; but
one and all would have done as good
work if there had been no such thing as
honors lists.
Finally, the arrangement inspires con-
tempt rather than loyalty. The general
public experiences the same disgust when
one type of crook buys the prefix “Sir”
as it does when another type of crook
buys the prefix “Honorable.”
Let’s abolish the imposture, and do
ourselves real honor in the eyes of the
world.
SECOND DIVVY.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
“He Prayeth Best Who Acteth Best.”
A Sydney man who draws a bit of
Queensland income was proceeded
against by summons the other day
because he had not furnished particulars
of it in his N.S.W. income-tax return for
the year to June 30, 1933. The informa-
tion was demanded in order that the
department might bill him for unem-
ployed-relief tax, now masquerading
under another name. During the hear-
ing Flynn, S.M., sought information on
his own account, and what he got moved
him to the following remarks:
Defendant paid the tax in Queensland
on income derived there which never came
into New South Wales. It seems ridiculous
that he should be called upon to pay again
in New South Wales.
The victim was nevertheless fined £2 and
costs. Presumably, there was no alterna-
tive under the law.
It is good to see a magistrate letting
fly at this most impudent variety of the
double-tax swindle, though “ridiculous”
is not the right word. No doubt more
expressive terms have been applied to
it by railwaymen working on the Vic.
Government lines that run north of the
Murray, who, though paid less on the
whole than N.S.W. Government railway-
men doing the same class of work, are
to be taxed a lot more. A correspondent
at Echuca thus states their case:
Although these railwaymen have paid
their dues to the Victorian Commissioner
of Taxation, they have received assessment
notices from the N.S.W. Department of
Taxation for unemployed-relief taxes for
the years 1929-30, 1930-31 and 1931-32.
The sums claimed range from £27 to £4O,
and 10 per cent, fines have been added.
The men have appealed to the Victorian
Railway Department, the Victorian Minis-
ter of Railways (who is also Attorney-
General) and the taxation departments of
both States, but so far they have received
no redress.
These are no isolated cases. Thousands
of N. S. Wales citizens who have already
paid two Commonwealth and two State
taxes on income they have drawn from
(or even left in) other States have been
welshed of this fifth tax ; and it is im-
posed, not on what remains after the
four legitimate taxes have been deducted,
but on the original amount. What makes
the thing more outrageous is that the N.
S. Wales rate (Is. in the £) is much higher
on small amounts than the Victorian or
Queensland rate. In Britain, Maoriland,
Canada and South Africa this sort of
spoliation is prohibited, and the Federal
Constitution should prohibit it in Aus-
tralia, but that exasperating instrument of
government is defective on this point, as
on so many others.
At the instance of Premier Stevens, the
proceedings of the N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly are now opened with prayer.
No doubt the Assembly needs to be
prayed for, but it would be a greater
exercise of religion to render justice to
taxpayers who are now robbed under
forms of law. Then Mr. Stevens would
at least be doing to others as he would be
done by.

Cancer Research.
Cancer-research methods in Australia
are in the melting-pot. Rumors are rife
of substantial changes in the Sydney
University unit, where a more practical
outlook undoubtedly was needed. Profes-
sor T. H. Laby, a member of Melbourne
University’s Cancer Committee, has
resigned. His views seem to coincide with
those expressed by The Bulletin re-
cently, that too much academic research
was being done and too little attention
given to the practical development of
deep-X-ray therapy and radium treat-
ment —fields showing sound remedial
results, and fairly encrusted with pro-
blems for the physicist and pathologist
which working therapists themselves have
no time to investigate.
Now that the matter has become a live
question, it is time to suggest a concrete
programme which should form the per-
manent basis of all future research:
(1) Concentration on practical problems
of treatment, research bodies to work in
double harness with the newly-formed
Australian Association of Radiologists.
(2) Application of part of the research
funds in hand in various States to the
establishment of Cancer Research Fellow-
ships which would adequately pay
younger physicists like those in Profes-
sor Laby’s own laboratory. Some of these
men are producing results which interest
the whole world on the sort of salary that
a self-respecting newspaper pays its fledg-
ling reporters. Subject to general super-
vision, these research Fellows should be
allowed the widest possible scope so long
as they appear to be driving in a prac-
tical direction.
(3) Establishment of special clinics at
all big hospitals for dealing with the re-
search aspects of actual treatment work
as they crop up.
(4) Provision of funds to allow research
workers to co-operate with overseas
research workers for the solution of
problems of- which they have a
specialised knowledge. There is one
case extant in which Australia, which
originated a certain piece of vital re-
search, is the only Dominion which is
not carrying out its share of progress
work allotted to it by an important
London conference. One of the research
workers concerned offered to give up a
lucrative practice and devote his whole
time to it if the Sydney Cancer Research
Department would find £lOOO p.a. to
cover absolute laboratory expenses. But
the Sydney Cancer Research Committee
needed the money to allow its young
men to indulge in far more academic
pursuits.
Lastly, a business committee should be
formed to take care of the finance of
research ; to prevent overlapping as be-
tween States, cities and hospitals ; to see
that workers who show research talent
are enabled to devote their time to in-
vestigation, and to issue regular reports
on the work which is going forward, so
that the whole business will be con-
ducted less like a secret society.

Victoria’s Eyes.
A piece of legislation sorely needed in
Victoria is an Optical Act. N. S. Wales,
Queensland and South Australia have
satisfactory ones. In Victoria the quack
prowls unrestricted.
Storekeepers in remote country districts
still keep trays of spectacles which cus-
tomers try on at their peril. Nearer Mel-
bourne hawkers peddle the disasters from
door to door. An optometrist has related
the case of a woman who came to him
well on the way to total blindness ; she
had been wearing a pair of glasses
guaranteed by a charlatan to be charged
with electricity, beneficial to her optics.
Another case is of a man who for ten
years had been wearing cheap glasses
made in Japan and sold to him by a
travelling vendor. The effect had been to
give his eyes a set which will probably
prove permanent.
The regular optometrist knows his
limitations. When he in a client’s state
detects pathological conditions that may
be attributable to blood, nerves or some
disease, he sends him to an oculist or
other specialist. The quack does not
believe in such ridiculous precautions.
He has a set of lenses for every set of
eyes, and when trouble develops he is
usually out of the district.
Optical science is nearer perfection
than medical science. A law controlling
the practice of the shyster optician is as
necessary as those controlling the nimble
freelances of medicine, especially these
days, when the population spends so much
time in cinemas.
The opticians themselves have implored
successive Ministries to do something
about it, but the guns have been spiked
by somebody or other who puts vested
interests before the community’s eyesight.

Ogilvie v. Lee.
A representative Tas. Nationalist gives
his party’s side of an argument mentioned
in B. 25/4/’34:-
The hydro-electric scheme was put into
the hands of a commission by Act of Parlia-
ment. Control, management and develop-
ment of the undertaking are, therefore, Minis-
terially unhampered.
The present power supply is scarcely sufficient
to meet existing peak-load demands. With the
full knowledge of the Government the commis-
sion has been collating data for a new scheme
on the Upper Derwent; a full report and pro-
posals were submitted to Cabinet. Somehow
the Opposition leader got hold of them and
used the information in furtherance of party
tactics.
But the declarations of Mr. Ogilvie as to
what he and his party would do if returned
to power are heavily discounted. No develop-
ment can be undertaken without the recom-
mendation of the commission or complete
alteration of an Act of Parliament.
Premier Lee’s opposition involved certain de-
tails of the original contract for the purchase
by a Labor Government of water rights and
power from the Complex Ores Co. Except for
a short period, the whole of the development
of this scheme has, since 1916, been under
Governments of which he has either been leader
or a member. So much for the assertion that
Premier Lee has been “a declared opponent
of the State-owned hydro-electric from the
beginning.”
«
The Sin of Mr. O’Reilly.
Mr. Creswell O’Reilly has once more
created consternation in the Australian
film world. He has censored “The
Silence of Dean Maitland,” “the greatest
Australian film of all time” (so called be-
cause the book, the scenes and characters
thereof, and the leading actor and actress
in the film are English), and “jeopardised
the anticipated overseas sales,” which
“will mean a loss of £25,000.” He has
done this by cutting out a scene in which
a lady is dressed in a towel and a gentle-
man is peeping over a cliff at her, and
another in which the Dean Maitland
‘‘loses his head in the intoxicating
presence of Alma Lee and kisses her” —
“considered to be the vital part of the
picture.”
The producers of this masterpiece are
innocent of “The Hayseeds,” but plead
guilty to “The Squatter’s Daughter.”
Presumably they felt when they had
made that picture that they had exhausted
the spring of native genius and used up
all the Australian plots. Anyway, they cast
round for something on which the copy-
right had run out, and into which Legs
could be flung. This yarn was safe enough
—it was written in 1886—but as nobody
seemed to have the knowledge of period
to place it in its own century, and as
ladies did not then go round in towels,
it was necessary to turn the musty mid-
Victorian thing into a peppy 1934 show.
So much money has been dropped by
confiding investors in Stuart Doyle enter-
prises that it would be a pity if the
gloomy anticipations of the flapper press
were realised. It is rather to be hoped
that Mr. Stuart Doyle and his staff will
produce some more great Australian
films. The Crimean War would be a
suitable period (there is a Balaclava in
Melbourne and there are Sydney streets
named after some of the generals and
battles, and mention of these would
supply the Australian touch). Queen
Victoria would make a hit with
the English public stepping out of
her Rolls-Royce at Brighton and being
greeted by the Archbishop of Canter-
bury in a singlet and shorts. Or what
about Florence Nightingale, with a ballet
of nurses, bathing in the Bosphorus, and
Lord Raglan (in a Sam Browne belt)
crouched on the Galata Tower peeping
through a telescope at the Sultan’s harem
(in Broadway shorts) across the Golden
Horn?
If “The Silence of Dean Maitland” is
worth £25,000 overseas, these ideas should
net Mr. Stuart Doyle at least a million.

Latham in Japan.
J. G. Latham is making a good showing
in Asia, and that is not easy at a moment
when Britain has been forced into estab-
lishing quotas in the cotton trade to
protect Lancashire against Japanese
competition, when the Singapore Base is
being pushed ahead vigorously, when a
stupid Japanese scare has been widely
advertised in Australia, and when a ner-
vous and somewhat jingo Japanese press
is speculating on a mysterious something
spoken of as the “coming 1935 crisis”
which people interpret as meaning war
with Russia and China, or with both.
Japanese relations with Australia have
always been friendly. Difficult situa-
tions, such as those arising out of dis-
turbances at Thursday Island and
Broome, have been treated helpfully by
the Japanese authorities. Japanese war-
ships convoyed Australian troops and
helped to defend Australian trade routes
during the war. And thousands of Aus-
tralian visitors to Japan are every year
treated with courtesy and consideration.
Despite the sensational stories which
creep into the flapper press, the under-
standing traveller, mindful of Oriental
prejudices, will find no gayer or more
openhearted welcome than along the by-
paths of interior Nippon.
Trade with Japan this year has meant
much to us. With exchange against
them, the Japanese bought more wool
during the 1933-34 season than Britain —
nearly £6,000,000 worth.
At the same time, there is undoubted
tension as between Japan and other
nations —there must be when countries
are fighting for their economic lives—and
it is good that we have been able to send
such an ambassador as Latham, experi-
enced, knowledgeable, tactful and diplo-
matic. Those who have seen him at work
abroad will rest easily as to the results of
his mission. He may not be an ideal
platform politician, but he equals the
Orient in courtesy, and —except, perhaps,
Casey —he is the only man in the Minis-
try whose training and nature fit him
to match his wits with diplomats to our
advantage.

Conflicting Viewpoints.
From “Jeames”:
A significant feature of Tom Clarke’s new
book about Australia is its long story of the
man from Victoria (had he been English he
“would have lived in some place like Surbiton”)
who was asked to a Buckingham Palace garden
party. The visitor, it seems, was clobbered
up like an ordinary Aussie, so he hired some
glad rags for twenty-five bob. He didn’t know
anybody at the party and nobody spoke to him,
but he enjoyed himself walking round admiring
the guests and other features of interest. Be-
fore returning the hired garments he decided
to be photographed in them, for remembrance,
as it were; and not wishing to travel under
false colors he let his taxi-driver and the
photographer into the joke. Back at his hotel,
he let the chambermaid into it, too. And not
a bad joke, either. N
It is saddening to find that Mr. Clarke plainly
regards his acquaintance as a cad, whereas the
whole of the evidence shows the man to have
been that rare phenomenon one of Nature’s
gentlemen. Compare him with my acquaintance
Lester Skyte, chartered accountant, of Golders
Green, who also was invited to Buckingham
Palace, by mistake. The reaction of L. S. A.
Duff-Skyte, Esq., as he became shortly after
his experience, was that of a typical member
of his class. I give his story as he has in-
sisted on telling it to me about 20 times —shaky
aspirates and all.
“The minute I got the invite I understood.
‘Bingo’—that’s the fifth duke, y’know—is a
kinsman of mine on the mater’s side, and, of
course, he ’as influence at Court. ‘Bingo’ never
comes out to my place at Golders Green —
not grand enough for ’im —but time was when
we Duff-Skytes lorded it over ‘Bingo’s’ branch
of the fambly.
“Well, I’m hardly inside the Palace gates
when I runs into young Bobbletonwyke—he
succeeded to the marquisate last year—an’ of
course he had to start asking the name of my
tailor. It shows the value of going to one
that can turn a man out like a gentleman, if
you know what I mean. Next thing I knew
Lady Angela—that’s ‘Wyke’s’ sister —says:
‘ ’Ow about presenting ’im to ’is Majesty?’ No
sooner said than done. ‘l’m delighted to meet
you, Duff-Skyte,’ says the King. ‘Your fambly
has done yeoman service for mine in the past.’
Last thing he said to me was: ‘ ’Ow did you
get that shine on your topper, Duff-Skyte?’
’E’s putting me up for the Marlborough Club
shortly.
“The only blot on the party was the
Colonials. Common fellers in ’ired soots. Not
what you could call a reel, bona fide gent,
among the lot of ’em.”
The result of Mr. Duff-Skyte’s adventure
has been to turn him into the leading North
London pest. Any one of a dozen key-words un-
warily uttered — e.g., “palace,” “king,” “party,”
“garden”—is enough to start him off. Under-
ground railway compartments, Ludgate Hill tea-
shops, Strand bodegas empty as he enters. If
only he had had the sense, like Tom Clarke’s
Aussie friend, to take the thing in
the right spirit! If only—also like Tom Clarke’s
friend—he had been able, after walking with
kings, to keep what Kipling calls “the common
touch”! Unfortunately the gift is rare every-
where, and rarest of all in British lower middle-
class circles.

Trade with Asia.
The report of the Queensland trade dele-
gation to Asiatic countries —W. J.
Austin, Under-Secretary to the Trade and
Industries Department, a level-headed
accountant, and W. Thomas, secretary to
the Queensland Colliery Owners—will
come as a shock to a lot of eager pub-
licists.
It has been the fashion to preach about
“teeming” millions on those parts wait-
ing to buy Australian goods. The mis-
sion regrets that, “as conditions are, there
is no foundation in fact for the belief
that there can be any enormous increase”
in Australian selling. They divide the
528,400,000 people in East Asia, outside
lapan, into three sections —312,000 Euro-
peans and Americans, 3,913,000 Indians
and foreign Orientals, the balance natives
—and they add:
From all sources of reliable information
(including that of representatives of Austra-
lian firms of many years’ standing in the
East) we would say that the total number
who might be considered potential cus-
tomers of Australia would include the Brit-
ish, European and American inhabitants
and a small proportion of the native popu-
lations .... they are sufficient in number to
provide at least some market.
They give their reasons in detail. Even
Europe, with its long-standing contacts,
scarcely touches native interior popula-
tions ; the depression has compelled
native populations to make themselves
completely self-supporting; they have
ample land to produce their needs, which
are mainly agricultural; in China 90 p.c.
of the population toils solely to secure
the barest of food, shelter and clothing ;
there has been everywhere a reduction
in the meagre wage rates of industrials
and a cut in piecework prices. Fortunate
is the native laborer who can earn 2s.
per day—a lot earn only Is.
In trade with the E. 1., British Malaya,
China and the Philippines, Australia
bought £3,504,427 worth of goods in
1932-33, out of which £1,962,000 repre-
sents our imports of kerosene and petro-
leum from the E.I. We sold to the
same countries £9,659,421 worth of goods.
From China we bought £266,938 worth
of goods, and we sold it £7,055,753 worth
of wheat, flour and dairy products.
On the mission’s showing, the pro-
posed expenditure of several thousand
pounds on Government Trade Commis-
sioners in the regions visited by these
Queenslanders is unwarranted.

"AND IT'S PRINTED with WIMBLE'S INKS"
“Mells”: These columns of cricket
comment encountered in every daily
paper are wearisome stuff, lit up by an
occasional gleam of brightness. Thus, for
instance, Mailey, Sydney “Sun’s” special
correspondent at the front:
After Kippax’s dismissal the Leicester
bowlers smiled expectantly, like ferrets wait-
ing at the mouth of a rabbit burrow.
The picture of a smiling ferret waiting
for his prey at the mouth of a burrow
will take some beating. I can’t help won-
dering how long he would have to wait.

“4 x 2”: It is natural enough that De
Valera’s troops should be armed and
equipped in English fashion (B. 2/5/’34),
for when the “Opprissor” marched out
in 1921 he handed over enormous stores
of rifles, ammunition and equipment. De
“Father, I have sinned.”
“Who is she?”
Valera is not likely to scrap all that gener-
ous issue because he dislikes those who
made it; anyway, he hasn’t got a small-
arms factory, and would have to import
from somewhere. “Centurion” is wrong,
however, when he says the uniform is
like that of the Black and Tans. They
wore a navy blue, “Tommy”-type uni-
form, with leather belt carrying bayonet
and revolver ammunition pouch. The
pistol itself was in a slung holster, and
rifle ammunition was carried in a regu-
lation leather bandolier. The headgear
was either a “tin lid” or Glengarry
bonnet. The present Free State forces
wear greenish field-grey and German-
type steel helmet. As for carrying the
rifle at the “slope,” the position of the
magazine decides that.

“Cleeve”: Sladen or somebody has
been blundering again. Last week several
Australian dailies printed a cable an-
nouncing a new biography of Adam
Lindsay Gordon, by D.S. The book is
called “A Bard of the Bush,” and reveals,
one learns, among other things, “the
poet’s hopeless love for Jane Bridges, the
daughter of a Worcester farmer,” who
refused a proposal from him on the eve
of his departure for Australia. The lady,
it is added, who has since been twice
happily married, is now 77. As a matter
of fact, Gordon left England in August,
1853, close on 81 years ago.
“Sailor”: The only memorial I
know of erected to commemo-
rate that fine job the Overland
North-South telegraph line is on
a big piece of natural ironstone
on Maria Island at the entrance
to the Roper River (N.T.).
Chiselled into the boulder is the
following inscription: “Steamship
Omeo, 1000 tons, ascended the
Roper River for 100 miles with
Overland Telegraph Expedition,
February, 1872.” The chap that
wielded the chisel knew some-
thing of stonemasonry, for the
inscription still shows up clear on the
weatherworn stone.

“Tenace”. A pompous English card
expert condemns the term “jack” (for
“knave”) as an “Americanism.” It sends
my mind back to Dickens’s “Great
Expectations” and the passage where a
youngster complains that he has been
brought up “to call ‘knaves’ ‘jacks,’ ”
the suggestion being that this will
handicap him with well-bred people.
The idea apparently dies hard, though
what was evidently a British vul-
garism when Dickens wrote is now stig-
matised as a Yankee one. Yet one reason
for the growing dominance of “jack”
since bridge hands began to figure so
largely in print is that J. is a much
handier symbol than Kn., though plenty
of English papers (possibly keeping
Dickens in mind) still stick to the latter,
I fancy that most Australian bridgers use
the two terms indiscriminately, without
knowing which they favor,

“Spit and Polish”: It’s a sound idea
(B. 9/5/’34) that Prince Henry should
make his progress through Melbourne on
horseback instead of being drawn through
the streets in a ridiculous State carriage.
Writer has never seen the Australian
article, but London Lord Mayors’ shows
and one or two royal processions have
convinced him that the gilded cage of
the State coach fails in its first reason for
existence —it doesn’t display the person
occupying it to the enthusiastic populace.
Prince Henry is an Imperial cavalry
officer, which is in itself an assurance
that he has had a certain amount of
horsemanship hammered into him ; he is
also a fair performer in point-to-point
steeplechases, and his pictures show him
as having a fine leg for a riding-boot—
“Alone with that young man in a parked car! When I was a girl we wouldn't
have dreamt of it.”

“S.T.S.”: Here is a disinterested sug-
gestion for greeting, or farewelling—it
will be the same occasion in the majority
of cases—whatever Prince may come.
About 20 years ago, a visiting theatrical
co. staged the Highland farewell on the
seashore to Prince Charlie. The chief
chorus began “Prince of my heart, though
I see you no more,” and worked up to a
great, wailing “Prince of my heart, good-
bye! ” Heard even only once, it was
unforgettable ; and I predict a striking
success for any school or women’s choir
which will take the trouble to it up.

“Lord Luvus”: Proposals are abroad
for large commissions to sculptors to re-
cord the early incidents in Melbourne’s
history, but the controversies that have
raged between historical bodies and
others over the subject leave the impres-
sion that there was very little romance
about it. Though gallons of ink have
been spilt over the question whether
Batman walked or boated up the Yarra
when he made the pregnant remark,
“This will be the place for a village,”
the sculptor who sets out to portray in
bronze or marble the Founder making
this prophecy is faced with the dilemma
of not knowing whether he was holding
the tiller-lines or standing impressively
on an antheap. There is even doubt
whether he uttered the words at all, as
they come down to us written in his
diary. I suggest that the sculptors give
up the prosaic Batman as a hopeless job
and concentrate on Fawkner. It would
not be wrenching truth too far out of
her orbit to represent Batman’s rival in
commercial dominance as Bacchus, wine-
wreathed and riding on a tiger sur-
rounded by frenzied nymphs and satyrs,
banging cymbals. Fawkner kept a pub,
in those days known as an inn. They
were hearty times, and there was a
Dionysian quality about their bibbing
which disappeared with the Early Clos-
ing Acts,

after him and throw down the young-

MY TROUBLES!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It doesn’t worry me about
This coming Vic. centen’ry
That those who looked for George to shout
Will have to whoop for Henry.
For jobs like these, it’s clear as mud,
They’re just as good as doubles,
For both are princes of the blood.
And, anyhow, my troubles!
I cannot say I greatly care
If those our laws who’re mapping
Decide to bow their heads in prayer
Before they fall to scrapping;
Albeit 1 doubt if any form
Of prayer the Chair rehearses
Will obviate the nightly storm
Of gibes and jeers and curses.
Oft as I hear it pro’d and con’d,
This latest church dissension,
I thank my stars it’s quite beyond
My humble comprehension.
The Angus row’s a noise to me
Like rumblings over rubbles —
Or T. S. Elliot’s minstrelsy,
The Sitwells’, too —my troubles!
I shall not hurl aloft my hat
Whene’er a century flashes
From Bradman’s scintillating bat
To bring us back the Ashes.
1 hope to see the sequel show
The better side the winner,
But howsoever Tests may go
It won’t atfect my dinner.
It leaves me cold, this faction prate;
1 do not care a penny
Though Lang and Scullin emulate
The cats of old Kilkenny.
1 reckon one is bluff and skite
The other froth and bubbles.
So clear the ring and let ’em fight,
The precious pair! My troubles!

T. THE R.


“Findy”: Does theology date? A
Sydney bookshop which devotes con-
siderable space to books of a religious
nature has the subject divided on its
shelves into the following sections:
“Theology (old),” “Theology (new),”
“Theology (recent),” “Theology (latest)”
and “Theology (second-hand).” The only
branch of the subject not provided for
appears to be “Theology (future).” It
would be interesting to watch the pro-
gress of a book through the various
stages. Prof. Angus’s “Truth and Tradi-
tion” is at present rated “latest.” In
how many weeks will it become “recent,”
in how many months “new,” and in
how many years “old” or even “second-
hand”?

ordnance put the fear of Sheol into some
of our pilots. We hadn’.t enough ’planes

“Well, I’m willing to bet that inside six months you’ll both
wish you’d married me.”
in India to stage an air gymkhana, and
what we had were old 8.E.2C5., scrapped
from France and badly worn out.
There were no bombers. Our old
’buses nominally carried pilot, observer,
machine-guns and light bombs, but owing
to the rugged landscape of the Frontier
the only way a working altitude could
be attained was for the pilot to dump
either the bombs and m.-gs. or the
observer. There was one pass in the
mountains where he could just scrape
over with 20ft. to spare. Presently
Banshut Khan and co. tumbled to the
fact and occupied the pass. They filled
their ancient flintlock, muzzle-loading
bundooks with the assorted scrap-iron
of the neighborhood, placed the butt on
the ground with muzzle pointing sky-
ward ; then, when our ’planes, limping
homeward, almost sat on the muzzles,
they pulled their triggers as one man.
After a week of miraculous escapes our
last workable ’plane flopped home with
two bullet holes in the propeller and
copious ventilation elsewhere, and we
decided to stay on the ground until our
air fleet was reinforced.
“Sinbad”: I once saw a Fritz ’plane
brought down without the use of guns.
During a patrol in a sub. early in 1918
we got tangled up in some nets, and in
breaking loose burnt out both main motor
armatures, and consequently had to pro-
ceed on the surface, using Diesel power.
Having only a short telescopic mast, we
were flying a kite, and the wire attached
to the kite was used as a W.T. aerial.
Shortly after we got clear, the drone of
a plane was heard, and a couple of “Iron
Crosses” zoomed down towards us. We
saw the first bomb leave the fusilage; per-
haps a second later the ’plane caught the
tip of its wing on our kite wire, turned
completely round and nose-dived into the
sea, some 50 feet from us. Four minutes
later we were proceeding to our base
with two slightly damaged, very disgusted
and very wet airmen in our bag.

“C.Q.”: Nine-tenths of Melbourne
doesn’t know how the other tenth earns
its living. The ketches which go out to
get the city’s crays are little cockleshells
with enormous wells, in which the succu-
lent commodity is kept fresh and alive.
Recently a terrific storm struck four of
these craft near King Island. They ran
for shelter to their moorings at New
Year Island, which provided only a prac-
tically open roadstead and a lee shore.
The Saguenay, with five men aboard,
battled against mountainous seas until the
engine conked out and the vessel drifted
on a reef. A member of the crew lashed
himself to the masthead; the terrific
plunging of the craft against the rocks
battered him to death. One man, McGrath,
after following a cobber with the inten-
tion of giving him help, managed to get
ashore, but the bodies of the other four
were washed up dead. The whole affair
was witnessed by the crew of another
ketch, who were powerless to assist. It
is not the first time that sea tragedies like
this have been connected with the crus-
tacean which is a stand-by of drunk-joke
humorists.
“Morningside”: Queensland health
authorities are worried over the high
incidence of chronic lead-poisoning—
nephritis. This occurs frequently when
an occupational cause is quite out
of the question, and is especially
noticeable among young children. The
use of lead paint has been for
some time suspected as a contribut-
ing cause, and its use has been pro-
hibited on verandah rails and fences
within easy reach of youngsters. One
case in the writer’s experience had to do
with verandah rails. A little girl was
observed to have the habit, when it was
raining, of following the raindrops down
a slightly sloping rail and drinking them
as they trickled down. She died of
nephritis, and there is no doubt that
many others have contracted the disease
in similar ways.
“Ekim”: In a recent version—a radio
one this time—of
the story of the
Bounty mutiny
the author
makes Bligh ap-
peal to one of
the mutineers to
remember hi s
“oath to his
Majesty the
Ki n g.” No
naval officer or
seaman has
ever taken an
oath of any
kind ; the only
sworn men in
British men-of-
war are the
marines.
"Look at this overcoat you bought me ! Big enough for a man twice my size."
“But, dear, it’ll cover the radiator of the car on cold nights.”
“Oxmead”: No man of our time has
appeared in more (and more diversi-
fied) roles than Ignatius Tribich Lincoln,
who, under his new name of Chao Kung,
was refused a landing on English shores
last week. Lincoln’s
:cord could hardly be
eclipsed in fiction. In
his twenties he was a
C. of E. curate; at 31
he was M.P. for Dar-
lington ; in the war
years he was a spy for
Germany; when
Kapp tried to over-
throw the German re-
public Lincoln was one
of the conspirators;
nowadays he is a
Buddhist monk. Inci-
dentally, he had a son,
an artilleryman in the
British Army, who was
hanged after the war
for the murder of a
brewery collector. Lin-
coln himself seems to
be a Hungarian Jew,
which may provide
some explanation of his
war activities, though,
of course, he had to be
naturalised before he
could sit in the House of Commons.
The man’s nerve in seeking readmission
to England, even as a Buddhist monk,
is not the least amazing thing about him.
He is still in his fifties.
* * * *
“Simba”: A recent film showed a tiger
and lion “fighting to the death in an
Indian jungle.” Apart from the fact that
India holds only a tiny group of maneless
lions, jealously preserved in a remote
corner of a native State, and that these
are as likely to be submitted to the
tender mercies of a stunt cinemato-
grapher as the inmates of the Maharajah’s
zenana, the lion is a black-maned Afri-
can. In the same picture a large python
appears loosely looped round the neck
of a buffalo, “strangling it to death.”
Pythons have been known to make
mistakes in estimating their swallowing
capacity, but the Laidley Worm would
hardly care to take on a 20001 b. buffalo.
In any case, this particular buff, queers
the pitch by calmly chewing grass.
“Pawang”: It would be interesting to
know how far Melbourne’s compul-
sorily devout Sabbath and its wowser
outlook generally are responsible for the
periodical outbreaks of curious perver-
sions. A few years ago a maniac started
slashing the sinews of horses.
An epidemic of hedge-burn-
ing followed. Lesser mani-
festations are the occasional
assaults on Young and Jack-
son’s famous bar-room art
gallery, one of whose trea-
sures, the “Chloe,” has from
time to time
been attacked.
The latest
phenomenon is
an animal poi-
soner, operating
on an extensive
scale in the re-
spectable suburb
of Brunswick.
His bag includes
scores of dogs,
nine horses and
hundreds of cats, which have been sent
to their ancestors with a combination of
ground glass and cyanide of potassium.
There may be some anti-capitalist signi-
ficance in the massacre, which is con-
fined almost entirely to expensive pets,
such as valuable Alsatians, whippets,
show dogs and Persians.
* * * *
“Corselet”: A notable performance in
deep-sea-dress diving was put up by one
J. R. Locke off Sydney Heads last week.
In an Australian-designed suit he found
the bottom at 270 ft., though the un-
pleasant attentions of a large shoal of
leatherjackets shortened his stay there.
The depth reached for an air-filled dress
is not a record —American Navy divers
sent down to inspect the sunken sub-
marine F 4 in 1915 reached 304 ft.-—but
the short time spent in lowering
and raising the diver is. Locke
reached the sea floor in 3min. lOsec. ;
the haul-up took only 3min. 35sec.
In all other dresses used up to
this—nothing in this paragraph applies
to the various steel cylinder gadgets con-
taining a man at the end of a telephone
—careful “staging” has to be observed
in letting a diver down or bringing him
up. In Locke’s case, once he was down,
four hours would have been necessary
before he could have been got to the
surface, the time, as he was hauled up
by degrees, being spent by him hanging
on the end of the hoisting rope.

“L. 1.8.”: As one who had a trifling
part in making it safe for democracy
(Christian brand), I am perturbed to hear
that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in
Jerusalem is being allowed to fall into
disrepair. It seems to have been a case
of falling between two stools. The policy
of Britain ever since the Mandate was
granted has been devoted to trying to keep
the peace between the Zionist Jews and
the Moslem Arabs, without much regard
to the Christian minority. When Russia
was a great Christian Power the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre was well looked
after. Greece and the Coptic Church
were minor guardians, but with the
passing of the might of Christian Russia
they seem to have been content to let
things slide.
CATO THE CENSOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Creswell O’Reilly, the Commonwealth Chief
Censor, took exception to several scenes in ‘The
Silence of Dean Maitland,’ including the portrayal of
a girl wearing only a bath towel.”
You may dress for the surf pretty much as
you like >
And occasion no fussing or fuming;
There’s little that gives beach inspectors the
spike
In the scantiest sort of costuming.
But a girl in the “flicks” whose apparel is nix
But a towel is regarded as highly
Improper, and hence she’s over the fence
In the eyes of our rigorous O’Reilly;
She raises the gorge of O’Reilly.
At tennis in shorts Araminta cavorts,
And the shortest have ceased to be shocking;
While out on the links there’s nobody blinks
At the absence of feminine stocking.
But a star on the screen where Maitland the
Dean
Is featured, draped simply and shyly.
In a generous towel, brings a menacing scowl
To the dial of Creswell O’Reilly;
She riles our exacting O’Reilly.
The sculptor in bronze or in marble may mark
Those charms that are purely corporeal;
You may gaze in Hyde Park, from dawning to
dark,
On the nudes of the Archie Memorial;
But the girl whose sole wear is a one-piece
affair,
Though its folds may envelop her nighly
From the neck to the knees, will repel and
displease
A censor like Creswell O’Reilly;
She’s over the odds with O'Reilly.

POLITICAL POINTS
“S. M. Herald” sent one of its young
men to Adelaide with Lyons and the
other Cabineteers. He reports that the
South Australians stubbornly refuse to
have ex-Laborite Price billeted on them
for the rest of his days as U.A.P. mem-
ber for Boothby, and that the feeling
against Butler on the score of his Five-
year Parliaments Act is such that his
Government may not last three years,
let alone five. Granny is gravely dis-
turbed at these evidences of indepen-
dence.
Though Angus, the late member, be-
longed to their party, the Nats, did not
contest the Gunbower (Vic.) by-election.
They left it to two Cockies —J. G. Mathe-
son, the “endorsed” candidate, and N. A.
Martin, who was refused endorsement.
The electors gave Martin a substantial
majority. It is a bad bump for the boss-
Cockies, but they deserve it for repudiat-
ing the open-go principle.
Westralia voted for secession, but has
small use for leading secessionists as Par-
liamentarians. It cast out Premier Mit-
chell, whose Government introduced the
Referendum Bill; and now Franklin,
Lord Mayor of Perth, and one of the
fiery ancients of the Dominion League,
has lost his seat in the Leg. Council. As
a result of the Leg. Council elections, it
is expected that Westralian Labor will
have fully seven seats (there are 30) in
the property House which would be its
boss if secession were granted.
Alf Jones, Greater Brisbane’s first
Labor Mayor, has been denounced to
the Trades and Labor Council as an
aristo. The charge is that he means to
wear the full rabbitskin regalia of office.
He denies it, but it is recalled that when
in London years ago he attended a royal
garden party in a banger coat with the
necessary appurtenances, including silk
topper, stick, gloves and spats ; and the
T. and L.C. is a prey to gloomy sus-
picions.
Writs are out for the Tas. State elec-
tion, which is to be held on Saturday,
June 9, under the proportional-voting
system. In office is the only remaining
pre-depression Government, which dates
from 1928 ; in opposition, a Labor party
which wound up the last Parliament with
10 members in a House of 30. A. G.
Ogilvie, its leader, is a sanguine young
man, but if betting on elections were
legal he could get long odds about its
chance.
Ogilvie was reckoned a Langster at
Sydney Trades Hall. He has written for
Lang’s newspaper, supported Lang's fac-
tion at “unity” conferences, swallowed
the Lang policy of “regional tariffs,” even
proposed “the postponement of overseas
interest payments” until “equitable adjust-
ments” were made. But he has evidently
found that Langism won’t go down in
Tasmania, so in his policy speech he said
this:
Each Nationalist candidate will raise the
false issue that the Labor party in Tas-
mania is in some way connected with Mr.
Lang. It is neither directly nor indirectly
affiliated with Mr. Lang’s party. We have
no arrangement or understanding with him
whatever.
And the worst of it is that the young
gentleman can’t be dealt with as Willis
was.
A communique from the “publicity
officer, the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment,” declares that much of the criti-
cism of the Government’s plans for
dealing with exports “is based upon in-
complete knowledge of the facts.” Of
course, the stuff should read “based on
the Government’s incomplete knowledge
of the facts.”
There are now 156 tax-agents practis-
ing in N.S.W. and Queensland alone.
The job of dealing with Government
bulldogs has become so complicated as
to be regarded as a learned profession—
the only one in which training often
consists in entering the enemy’s service
and learning his habits and weaknesses
and then blossoming out as the tax-
payer’s friend. And how the poor fellow
needs a friend in a country where it takes
a High Court to decide whether fried fish
and chips is a manufactured article for
taxation purposes!
Commonwealth Minister Marr is
quoted in a prospectus reviewed on the
Business, Robbery page:
When the Finns insignis was first planted
in the Federal Territory 1 said that in thirty
years the profit from it would wipe out the
war debt [£283,134,300 at June 30, 1933].
I still believe that to be true.
Doubtless Mr. Marr said it—it is just
the sort of thing he would say. But does
anyone out of Bedlam believe it?
The Commonwealth Government is
trying to buy a 7000-ton cruiser now
under construction in Britain. Pearce
apologetically explains that the vessel is
needed “to replace the Brisbane, now

obsolete,” but militant pacifists are now
convinced that the mild ex-carpenter is
bent on starting “another imperialist
war.”
Large-hearted financiers have offered
£5,000,000 for the N.S.W. Government
tramways. They cost £9,000,000, have
(regardless of the public’s convenience)
been freed from ’bus competition, and
are beginning to show profits again after
a succession of bad years. The answer
was in the negative.
Lang’s newspaper has had the gall to
“congratulate the Labor party on the suc-
cessful issue of its long fight for the
abolition of the deadly tram footboard.
Between 1920 and 1932 its boss was
Treasurer for six years and Premier for
four. During that time he had the spend-
ing of lashin’s of borrowed money;
but he never earmarked a pound towards
doing away with the footboard, nor did
his servile followers ever try to force
his hand.
The harassed South. Aus. Railway
Commissioners, who have been occu-
pied for years in defending Common-
wealth arbitration cases since the High
Court (reversing its own judgment) de-
cided that State railwaymen might
patronise the Federal “shop,” recently
served a “log” on the Federated Loco.
Enginemen and other unions in conjunc-
tion with their worried brethren in
N.S.W. Drake Brockman, J., ruled that
an industrial dispute existed and referred
it to his Court. Justice Evatt overruled
him, with costs against the Commis-
sioners, saying “there is no industrial
dispute.” That was in Sydney on April
20. On May 9 the South Aus. loco,
enginemen started a regulation strike.
Stevens and Dunningham are having a
lot of trouble with the Sydney Water
Board ; but they went looking for it, as
it were. They began by saying they
were going to reform the inept and ex-
travagant concern; then they rained con-
cessions on the unreformed institution —
reduced its interest so that it wouldn’t
raise the rates, helped it to unemployed-
relief grants, finally advanced it
£2,500,000 for works. Before long they
were informed that the board was play-
ing up the easy money as if the boom
were back again; and now the atmo-
sphere is full of charges and counter-
charges, threats of slander actions and
demands for a Royal Commission.
A nomad lies under sentence of death
for murder. The body was fished out
of the Murrumbidgee ; the victim, a man
on the dole who, like accused, had been
“in trouble,” was identified by the finger-
print branch of the C.1.D., the skin of
his right hand having parted from flesh
and bone in the process of decomposi-
tion. During the trial at Wagga a Crown
witness was shot dead in the dingy camp
where the local unemployed hang out
“in huts of tin and bags.” He was from
Narrandera, and is described as an in-
valid pensioner, having qualified eight
years ago by being knocked on the head
with a bottle. It is easy to rail, but it
would be wiser to investigate the condi-
tions which produce such characters and
such conduct.
Brisbane’s new Labor City Council
has already decided to abolish one-man
trams plying on little-used lines. They
work well, the only disadvantage being
that one man draws wages where there
is an opening for two to do so. So these
arks are to carry a conductor and a
driver, and in the intervals of collecting
the rare fares the pair will be able to
discuss what’s going to win at “The
Creek.”
Before the Grants Commission left
Canberra the Assistant Secretary to the
Treasury accused the South Aus., West-
ralian and Tas. Governments of “adjust-
ing” their deficits so as to magnify the
effects of “disabilities.” In the “adjust-
ments” the South Aus. deficit moved from
£1,008,000 to £1,208,000, the Westralian
from £860,000 to £1,094,000, and the
Tasmanian from £55,000 to £318,000. He
suggested that, if there was any adjusting
to be done, Auditors-General should do
it; and so they should.
A surplus of £2,391,000 was shown on
the Commonwealth’s operations for ten
months, and there is still a lot of income-
tax revenue to come in. But in the
next two months large interest payments
and public-works commitments fall due,
and £1,870,000 for wheatgrowers’ relief
still has to be met.
With the moving of the Department of
Commerce to Canberra, that wind-swept
rose garden will be almost complete.
Something is needed to fill up the empty
spaces. What with Mr. Latham and
train in Japan, and Mr. Parkhill and
retinue on a glittering tour of the Courts
and Chancelleries of Europe and America,
and the Cabinet sternly doing its duty in
Adelaide, and all the members of both
Houses seized with homesickness for
their electorates as rumors of an impend-
ing election grow louder, Canberra is a
lonely and silent spot. Even the Cancer
Conference was welcomed by the inhabi-
tants as a cheerful diversion.
Goebbels is strafing the Jews again,
and a Nazi newspaper is “inaugurating
an inquisition into the behavior of every
Jew in Germany.” Perhaps this explains
the fuss made about a sentence in Isaac
Isaacs’s Anzac Day message:
Australia stands to attention in honor
of her heroic sons who, in her name, went
forth to the rescue of civilisation from the
organised banditry of force.
The Consul-General protested, and the
Government sent his letter on to the
G.-G., who replied that
The passage... .was not directed against
the German nation, but was directed solely
to the principles therein stated in terms
which I believed, and still believe, are right,
and were not designed to give offence.
The G.-G.’s father was one of those Jews
from eastern Europe for whom the
special wrath of the Nazis is reserved.
Although competition in three States
has reduced Tasmania’s receipts from
lotteries its Government got £129,500
from this source last year. The Com-
monwealth had a 12j p.c. tax on lottery
prizes but dropped it to help the Speck.
Naturally it had to give Queensland the
same concession and extend it to N. S.
Wales and Westralia when those States
went into the lottery business. It would
be a fair thing to revive the impost and
give income-tax-payers a corresponding
abatement. It is grotesque that the
gambler whose ticket draws £5OOO or
£25,000 should be exempt when the Com-
monwealth taxes property income 7s. 6d.
in the £ plus 6 p.c.

A link with one of Australia’s oldest
racing families snapped when Mrs. de
Mestre died at Moss Vale (N.S.W.). She
was the widow of Ettie de Mestre, who
established a record which is never likely
to be beaten by owning and training the
winners of four Melbourne Cups—Archer
(1861 and 1862), Tim Whiffler (1867) and
Calamia (1878).
Ipswich (Q.) can lay claim to Aus-
tralia’s oldest German —Ludwig Kurth.
He is 101, and has been in Queensland
for 68 years. He helped to construct the
first bridge over the Brisbane River —
at Spencer’s Crossing. Then he took up
farming in the Brisbane Valley district,
and stuck to it till he gave up daily toil
ten years ago.
Maurice Blackburn, the Victorian
Speaker, who has been pre-selected for
Frank Anstey’s safe Federal seat, Bourke,
is fylel bourne’s most persistent second-
hand book fan. A peculiarity is that he
won’t pay more than 6d. for a book. A
friend told him where he could buy a
masterpiece for 3s. 6d. “It’s no good to
me,” replied the collector. “I’d want a
library for that amount.”
Louis McCubbin, president of the Vic.
Artists’ Society, has been appointed
manager of Melbourne centenary’s floral
fete. His father, Frederick, was one of
Victoria’s most distinguished painters,
and his brother Alexander was a pioneer
LOUIS McCUBBIN, who will manage

publisher of art books. Louis got his
training at the Vic. Art Gallery. Since
the war he has been much employed
doing backgrounds for the sets of the-
War Museum. One of the best-humored
men alive, his Falstaffian figure is a
familiar sight at artists’ gatherings.
John Smales, the Brisbane auctioneer,
who has passed on, was intended for the
Methodist ministry, and became known
in Yorkshire, where he was born, as the
“boy preacher.” However, he abandoned
his ecclesiastical ambitions in the ’nineties
and started as an auctioneer in Black-
pool. He arrived in Melbourne in 1913,
and established Smales and Co. in Bris-
bane in 1914.
Dr. R. J. Noble is the youngest presi-
dent the Royal Society of N. S. Wales
has had, and it is the oldest scientific
society in Australia. A biologist in the
Department of Agriculture, he was a
cadet the year before the war started, and
he graduated with first-class honors and
the University medal in 1915. Before
graduating he joined the A.1.F., and he
served for the rest of the war in Egypt
and France. He won the first Ben Fuller
travelling scholarship in 1921, and took
on wheat research work in the U.S.A.
Sir Howard d’Egville, secretary of the
Empire Parliamentary Association, who
will probably attend the Vic. centenary
celebrations with Malcolm, son of Ram-
say MacDonald, is one of the N.S.W.
Bar’s few honorary members. He was
entitled to be called, anyhow, as he is a
barrister of the Middle Temple. A small,
bald, chirpy individual, he has penetrated
to practically every corner of the Empire
in the pursuit of his chosen mission of
keeping the institution intact. He is a
bachelor, elderly and a first-class after-
dinner speaker.
Dr. Jarvie Hood, who died in Sydney,
aged 73, last week, was one of the many
brilliant Scots who have made names for
themselves in the Australian medical
world. He arrived from Glasgow Uni-
versity just half a century ago. Soldier-
ing was one of his hobbies, and he was a
lieut.-colonel in the A.M.C. and the
possessor of the V.D. decoration. The
thousands of Diggers whom he either
attended or befriended have affectionate
recollections of the kindly little man
with the smiling moustached face and the
gentle voice who was so conspicuously
unmilitary while on his hospital rounds.
An honorary consulting physician of
Sydney Hospital, he got a knighthood in
1921. Oddly enough, it was recom-
mended by a Labor Government —he had
done his best to save the doomed John
Storey.
Sergeant-Major Semoi, of the Papuan
Armed Native Constabulary, who has
gone under at last at Daru, was a hero
of sorts. Like most of the early n.c.os.
of the A.N.C., which he joined in the
’nineties, Semoi was a Kiwai from the
Fly estuary, and the possessor of a
natural gift of command. Long service
all over Papua had earned him a pres-
tige which was the envy of many Euro-
pean officers. It was Semoi and his
police-boat’s crew that kept the then
Administrator, Barton, and Judge Murray
afloat in the tempestuous seas of the
Gulf of Papua for hours after their
whaleboat had capsized on Vailala bar.
Another crew from the Merrie England
eventually rescued the party in the dark-
ness.
P. B. Macgregor and A. D. McGill,
who are taking silk, will be Q.’s first
K.Cs. since the late Jacob Stumm was
raised to the Bench in 1929. Peter, an
Ipswich Grammar boy, was an exhibi-
tioner at Sydney Uni. before he went to
Balliol. He has been an Acting-Supreme
Court Judge. About his biggest job
otherwise was as Commonwealth Royal
Commissioner to inquire into the mining
tenures on the New Guinea goldfields
when the miners and the Administration
were at odds some years ago. McGill,
also an Ipswich lad and a Sydney Uni.
exhibitioner, was a schoolmaster in N. S.
Wales for a while, and was only admitted
to the Q. Bar in 1911. He has been
chairman of the Nat.-Progs. for some
years. He led for the Crown in the Mun-
gana case.
From Brisbane:
Though P. B. Macgregor and A. D. McGill
are applying for “silks” together Macgregor
is 20 years older than his learned and like-
wise close personal friend. Their friendship
dates from the time when Macgregor moved for
McGill’s admission to the Bar. McGill read
with his senior and then took adjoining
chambers in the old “Telegraph” building.
While other barristers changed their chambers
when the Inns of Court were built, these two
have not moved, and have worked their excel-
lent libraries together.
Major-General G. W. Barber, who
retires from the Director-Generalship of
Medical Services in August, has been
nine years at H.Q. in Melbourne. An
Englishman, he practised at Kalgoorlie
for years. He filled many medical jobs
in the Great War, ending up as Deputy-
Director of the Australian Corps, in
charge of all the arrangements during
the final pushes.
The death has occurred at Forbes
(N.S.W.) of veteran pressman H. Ran-
dolph Beech. Beech was managing edi-
tor of the Kanowna “Democrat” when
White Feather Main Reef was a big mine,
and representative of the Kalgoorlie
“Miner.” In 1906 he left the ’fields to
join the Bunbury “Herald.” The Mus-
wellbrook (N.S.W.) “Chronicle” was the
last paper he was associated with. Music
was his hobby ; he was a composer, a
capital critic, and a cheerful soul alto-
gether.
Alderman Parker, Sydney’s First Citi-
zen for the time being, has broken into
the limelight again with an attack on the
Stevens Government’s proposal to
abolish the lodger franchise. He is

tics, being, so far as can be gath-

ered, an anti-Labor Laborite. As one
of the city’s leading family lawyers
he is a crusted Tory, and this is the part
which he invariably dresses. Yet, as one
who owes his chain and rabbitskin to
Labor support, he sometimes goes
quite Pink'. In private life he is a genial
little man, with an excellent library, who
once saw Galsworthy and one or two
more literary idols plain.
Another link parted in a long Austra-
lian chain when J. C. Hassall, under-
writer, died in Brisbane at 77. The
founder of the Australian family came
out for the London Missionary Society
in 1798, and, under the wing of Rev.
Samuel Marsden, settled down as a
farmer-preacher at Dundas. He backed
Bligh during the rebellion. This did him
no good with the rum-dealers, but Mac-
quarie made him superintendent of Gov-
ernment herds on the strength of his ex-
perience in looking after Governor King’s
cattle. The best-known of the later
generation of the family was that fine
old parson James Hassall, the father of
J.C., who started his son on a commer-
cial career 60 years ago with Gibbs
Bright.
W. H. Ryan, who has handed in his
wand of office as Q.’s Commissioner of
Police after 41 years of service, has
served as Commissioner under Theodore,
Gillies, McCormack, Moore and Fbrgan
Smith. His early experiences with the
force were in the North, particularly in
Charters Towers, no bed of roses in those
roaring days.
A. G. C. Hawthorn, who has died in
Brisbane in the 74th year of his age and
the 50th of his legal practice, was a Tas-
manian who came to Queensland in the
mid-’eighties and joined Macdonald-
Patterson, Fitzgerald and Hawthorn.
Latterly he was in partnership with
W. J. Byram. After Federation, he won
J. G. Drake’s State seat, Enoggera,
against Mat Reid, and held it till 1911,
when he resigned. In his earlier years
he was a Morganite, and, when Peter
Airey lost his seat, in 1907, Hawthorn
took Airey’s place in the Kidston Gov-
ernment as Home Secretary, an office
which he exchanged the following year
for the Treasurership. In 1911 he left the
Ministry and went to the Legislative
Council. He married a daughter of
Alexander Stewart, the softgoods man.
Vic. National Gallery’s latest Felton
Bequest acquisition is a fine self-portrait
by Justus Jorgensen, priced at 100
guineas. Jorgensen is Victorian-born of
Norwegian parents (his father was a
ship’s captain who traded for many years
to Melbourne), and he was one of the
20 or so pupils of gallery-director Hall
who followed Meldrum into the wilder-
ness in the great secession. After paint-
ing in Paris and in London, he returned
to Melbourne. Acting-director Mclnnes
recommended the purchase, which is the
first Jorgensen to enter the national col-
lection.
Mrs. S. Vaughan, who had a 90th
birthday at Bondi the other day, belongs
to N.S.W.’s most political family. Her
late husband represented Grenfell for 16
years ; her father, the late Thomas Colls,
was member for Yass ; and a sister-in-
law is a daughter of the late Jimmie
Abigail, sometime M.L.A.
Agar Wynne, who died on Saturday,
aged 84, after a long illness, was in his
prime when George Reid started the anti-
sosh campaign 28 years ago. Wynne had
retired from Vic. politics in 1905, but
in 1908 he stood for Balaclava in the
Reps, and won easily. He became Joe
Cook’s P.M.G. in 1913, and retired from
Federal politics the following year.
Everybody in Parliament liked him, in-
cluding Andy Fisher and Billy Hughes,
whom he was required by the exigencies
of the party system to accuse of designs
on Empire and marriage tie. He owned
Cider (winner of an A.J.C. Derby), The
Doctor’s Orders (Sires’ Produce Stakes)
and other good horses. A city solicitor
by profession, his heart was in the coun-
try, and he died on one of his stations.
Ernest Lamb, K.C., of the Petrol Com-
mission, is a typical London K.B.D.
“silk” in appearance, voice and manner ;
yet he has been at the N. S. Wales Bar
for 47 years (and a K.C. for 23 of them)
and he was born in Sydney. His grand-
father was an R.N. officer whose de-
scendants are to be found all over the

best card players in the Union Club. He
has been chief counsel for the N. S.
Wales railways since he took silk, and,
though ex-Premier Lang once threatened
angrily that he would never appear in
that capacity again, he still carries on.
G. O. Allen is one of his numerous
nephews.

The management put more ginger into
the hunt last year, the taxgatherer made
off with less of the takings, and policy-
holders benefited. In the Ordinary
branch an extra £1,021,333 of new busi-
ness was put on the books (£7,371,776).
The spring in income was £373,376, of
which net premiums, etc. (£1,652,201),
accounted for £159,117, and net interest,
etc. (£480,957), for £62,798. Realisa-
tions turned in a profit of £128,450, and
credit was taken for £23,011 of unreal-
ised profit on securities purchased at a
discount and repayable on fixed dates.
There are other offices which take unreal-
ised profit into account without disclosing
the figure. The larger business was handled
at an extra cost of £38,370, but claims
were £66,281 lighter. Excluding taxes,
exes, took 24.5 p<c. of the net pre-
miums plus consideration for annui-
ties as against 24.6 p.c. in the pre-
vious year. Of the £714,538 that
remained in the business, £586,096
was added to the Assurance fund (now
£11,885,723). The other £128,000-odd
was tossed into the contingency reserve
(£206,500), which supplements the earn-
ings of the fund.
In the Industrial section the growth in
new business (£1,829,780) was £181,438.
Income was £50,277 stronger ; net pre-
miums (£530,468) accounted for about
half the increase. The excess of incom-
ings over outgoings was £34,427 better
at £290,627. Including £4902 earmarked
for welfare service, 32.7 p.c. of the net
premiums went in exes, as against 32.3
p.c. in 1932.
The surplus available for distribution
amongst policy-holders expanded by
£106,590 in the Ordinary and by £Bl9B
in the Industrial section:

to £4 p.c. on those 45 years or more in
force. In the Industrial section reversion-
ary additions to the sum assured will re-
main unaltered at from 20s. p.c. to 50s.

The year’s improvement in the net in-

tributed largely to the better showing.

Of each £lOO of interest and rents, the
Government took £l4 18s. last year, or
£2 4s. less than in ’32, and the net return
on mean funds improved by 7s. lOd. p.c.
The office assumes that its Life funds
(£14,722,145 in the Ordinary and Indus-
trial sections combined) will turn in a
clear 31 p.c. In addition, there were con-
tingency and fidelity guarantee reserves
totalling £258,234, and an accident fund
of £136,064.
The lot, together with outstanding
claims, etc., was invested in this way:

The 10 p.c. divs. came mostly from the
scattering of public loan money. To
cover the estimated shrinkage in the book
value of the quarries (Prospect, Minna-
murra and Bombo), shares in other cos.
(the Western Blue Metal Co.’s business
was bought in 1930) and other assets,
£209,848 was written off, leaving £151,309
(= 11s. per ord. share) of the capital
unrepresented by tangibles at the end of
November, 1932. A more detailed view
of what occurred in this and other
respects is provided by the following
comparison of balance-sheet figures: —•

Over the two years to the close of
accounts in 1932 (no figures were pre-
sented for 1931), £165,693 was knocked
off the book value of fixed assets and
£45,420 off shareholdings.
To rub out the deficit and adjust
capital rights to altered trading condi-
tions, the board suggested that the face
value of all shares be halved, reducing
them to 10s. each, and that the pref. div.
be made 5 p.c. non-cumulative, with the
right to advance with the ords. beyond
that point. The proposal was rejected as
an abrogation of pref. rights for the
benefit of the ords. Then a committee
of pref. shareholders and the board drew
up separate schemes. The board’s new
proposal was to write off ss. per share
of the pref. and 10s. per share of the ord.
capital, to make the pref. div. 5 p.c.
cumulative, with the right to advance
beyond that point to 1\ p.c. with the
ords., and to cancel arrears of pref. divs.
The committee agreed to forego arrears
and to reduce the div. to a minimum
5 p.c. cumulative. But it considered that
the face value of the pref. shares should
remain at £l, that they should advance
with the ords. beyond 5 p.c. without re-
striction, that they should have priority
as to capital, and that the holders thereof
should have the right to appoint a
director to the board. Considering the
circumstances, they are reasonable re-
quests. Negotiations have continued
throughout the year, and the chairman
expects that agreement will be reached
presently.
The board doesn’t say what the co.’s
earnings were last year. The business
was “well maintained,” and after visibly
setting aside £6286 for depreciation, the
p. and 1. debit remained unaltered at
£151,309. The excess of liabilities over
more or less liquids was reduced by
£5813, leaving it at £2225.
The market notes this and the improve-
ment in the demand for metal, and prices
the prefs. at 14s. and the ords. at 7s. 9d.
as against 3s. 6d. and 2s. respectively a
year ago.

Encouraged by the spring in the earn-
ings of Carlton Hotel, Ltd., whose div.
had been rushed up from 9 p.c. to 15
p.c. over the five years to Oct. 31, 1929,
those in control decided that it would
be a good thing to link up a number of
city hotel properties. Hence the present
holding co. was formed towards the close
of 1928. It has £139,728 of capital to
feed in 69,864 fully-paid 7 p.c. cum.
prefs. and 139,735 ords. paid to 10s.
each. One pref. and two ords. were
handed out for each of 59,846 ords. in
Carlton Hotel and 10,000 ords. in the
Eneber Investment Co., which is also in-
terested in hotel properties. Inciden-
tally, a similar offer was made for the
ords. in Usher’s Hotel, but nothing came
of it. The co.’s only other asset at the
end of Oct. last was £B2l of cash, etc.
Creditors figured for £2732.
In the first year there was £ll2l more
profit than the pref. div. and 6 p.c. to
the ords. called for. Then the storm
burst, the two operating cos. failed to
contribute to the pool, and the market
threw this investment co.’s scrip into the
discard. The recent spring in the earn-
ings of Carlton Hotel, however, has re-
vived interest in the paper, and the pound
prefs. have advanced from 10s. to 225.
6d., and the 10s.-paid ords. from 6s. Bd.
to par over the last six months. Though
the holding co. registered a loss of
£ll9 for the year ended Oct. 31 last, it
paid a full year’s pref. div., and another
shilling per share was distributed last
month, reducing the arrears to approxi-
mately 2s. 2d. per share (£7568).
That was because Carlton Hotel, after
cleaning its own prefs.’ slate, paid 7 p.c.
on its ord. capital in Dec., followed by
a special dividend of 6 p.c. last month.
The £8053 it netted for the 12 months
to the end of Oct. was enough to pay a
year’s div. on its own prefs. (there are
20,000 of them) and then show 11.3 p.c.
on its £60,000 of ord. capital. Nothing
was received from the Eneber Co., which
netted £5l for the year to June 30, 1933.
To meet its own annual pref. require-
ments and pay 5 p.c. on its paid-up ord.
capital this investment co. needs to re-
ceive 10.4 p.c. on the face value of its
total shareholdings. Prospects of the
prefs. getting the balance of their arrears,
and of the ords. then coming into the
picture, have thus greatly improved. Still,
the position will look more attractive
when the amount of outside money
in the Carlton Hotel (£115,946, down
£25,885 during the year) is substantially
reduced. Leaving £23,824 of specific re-
serves out of the reckoning, it was £14,752
in excess of shareholders’ funds (capital
and reserves combined) at the end of Oct.

thanks partly to the volume of business
which the parent, whose name is a house-
hold word throughout S. Aus., has been
able to transfer or influence. The effects
of the fall in values and cut in returns
from Government securities have been
largely offset by continued expansion of
the business:

For the 12 months covered by the latest
accounts* the net growth in the volume
of trusts on the books was £662,003 as
against £490,703 for the previous term.
Moreover, the larger business was
handled at nearly £4 p.c. less cost. The
improvement in corpus and other com-
mission earnings (£32,093) was £lOl2,
and in interest, etc. (£8941), £526. The
net result was thus £1997 better at 13.5
p.c. on the £90,000 of capital as against
11.3, 12.4, 13 and 14.5 p.c. back to 1930.
Interest, etc., alone was 9.9 p.c. on
capital, which gives the 10 p.c. div. a
very secure look. In addition, there is
the net return from the trust business,
the growth of which can be expected to
continue.
In these days of cheap money and keen
competition for sound securities, it is not
surprising that the market prices the
pound shares paid to ss. at 13s. 6d. The
return at the higher figure is 3.7 p.c. on
a 10 p.c. div. basis. In the past the policy
was to keep the div. steady and issue
new shares at par as the growth of the
business warranted. The new issues have
been in the nature of a bonus to policy-
holders, because the shares have always
commanded a high premium in the
market.

Because there are prospects of the dry
spell being broken, the market is now
giving more attention to the prefs., which
have gone without for the last four years.
There are 40,000 of them in a capital of
£143,398. They carry a cumulative 8
p.c., reduced to 6.2 p.c. by the statutory
cut from Oct. 1, 1931, and have priority
as to capital. At 18s. (they were priced
at 6s. a year ago) the return would be
6.8 p.c. on a 6.2 p.c. div. basis (= £2480
p.a.), and there was approximately
£11,190, equal to ss. 7d. per share, com-
ing to them at the end of Dec. last. The
more speculative ords. are priced at 7s.

The contraction of £254 in last year’s
net earnings, which were £1268 in excess
of a full year’s pref. requirements, was
due to a growth of £1250 in exes.
(£28,899, including the previous year’s
tax bill and something for depreciation
and bad debts). That is disregarding
£5OOO, making £lO,OOO in all, reserved
against the co.’s hoLding in Buchanan
and Co., the Brisbane subsidiary, whose
assets have been revalued ; the £lO,OOO
is said to cover all losses in this con-
nection.
In 1932 all available reserves (£61,486
—goodwill, £25,000, has not been treated

the book value of assets more into line

and gone a bit into debt to do it:

Last year £5435 was clipped off the out-
side debt (£74,670), leaving it £17,248 in
excess of book debts, stocks and cash, or
£3014 less than the previous year’s excess.
The reduction in excise and other
taxes and the growth in employment
favor a better showing at the end of the
current year. By that time the market
expects payments to the prefs. to begin.
It is difficult to say when the more specu-
lative ords. are likely to come into the
picture.

The spring in the latest figures, which
reflect the recovery in the building trade,
fitted in with market anticipations, the
pound shares having advanced steadily
from 15s. to par over the last 12 months.
For the eight months to the end of
February the value of permits issued for
the erection of dwellings in Greater Mel-
bourne was £1,285,183 as against
£834,115 and £333,790 for the corre-
sponding periods of the two preceding
years. Still, it was less than half the
figure for the eight months to the end
of February, 1930, when the co.’s gross
earnings were £17,104. They were
£10,749, up £5149', for the last term, and
exes. (£2820) took only £4Ol of the in-
crease. Including an unexplained addi-
tion of £917 to reserves, the net result
sprang £5665, reaching 5.8 p.c. on capi-
tal as against 2.1 p.c. for the previous
year, and the div. was lifted from 1 2-3
p.c. to 5 p.c.

How to get the things
YOU WANT
s/m m Y son (a wise father will say), there is a
IYi way to get most of the things you want
in life, and that way is through member-
ship in the A.M.P. i have got only some of the
things I wanted, because my dad didn’t impress on
me the value of Life Assurance as an aid to getting
the most out of life.
“If 1 had known, at your age, what 1 now know
about the A.M.P. and its various policies, you and
Mother and I could be having a trip round the
world. We could have a house that belonged to
us, and a motor car, and your future and your
mother’s could be secure. I have made some pro-
vision, but not what I could have made had I known
' about the A.M.P. earlier.”
A young man cannot interest himself in the A.M.P.
too early in life. The earlier he begins to invest in
its policies, the less he will have to invest to get the
things he will want later in his life.
Men of all ages would be wise to seek an A.M.P.
counsellor and learn how this Society (with
£93,000,000 of Assets) can be used for their own
ends. There is a book, “Investing in Happiness,”
that will be gladly sent to any address.

encouraging. But competition is very
keen, and that is pretty certain to mean
narrow margins. It is doubtful, there-
fore, whether anything better than 5 p.c.
need be looked for.

There is talk of a large-scale mining
exploration of Dutch New Guinea, the
Netherlands Indies Government having
granted concessions to a group which in-
cludes Oroville Dredging, the Papua
Billiton Co. and the Rejong Lebong Co.,
of Batavia. Oroville, a London concern
with large interests in S. America, already
has a finger in several pies in Australia
and New Guinea. Papua Billiton
sounds like a pup of the big Billiton Co.
which works the island of that name for
tin, and is one of the world’s biggest
producers of the metal. Most of the
shares in Billiton are held by the N.E.I.
Government.
* * * *
Misima Gold Reefs has given Oroville
Dredging, London, a 12 months’ option
from the end of March last over its
leases on Misima Island. The property
adjoins Fred Cuthbert’s New Misima
show, which is now paying divs. at the
rate of 18s. p.a. on its pound shares. But
whether there is enough stone of the
right value in the optioned area to war-
rant the formation of a large co. remains
to be proved. If the option is exer-
cised the vendor gets £4OOO cash plus
10 p.c. of the scrip, fully paid, in any
co. formed to work the leases.

Charters Towers is beginning to think
of its past glories again. The old Queen
Cross mine, which used to be one of the
best producers on the field, has been re-
opened by the New Queen Cross Co.
Stoping on No. 4 level opened three feet
of half-ounce stone. After 15 tons of
this had been taken out, dish prospects
showed the gold content to be an ounce
to the ton. Also a new make of stone,
struck at No. 3 level, shows a foot of
nicely mineralised ore, going over an
ounce, and old hands are confident that it
will extend under the former workings.

Cliff Rutledge, G.M. of N.Q. Gold
Mining and Development Co., recently
visited The Oaks field (N.Q.) and final-
ised arrangements for testing the 500-acre
concession secured. This takes in all the
miners’ areas now being worked. It was
formerly under option to B.H. Prop.
Millions of tons, approximating 3dwt.
gold, are said to be available for open
cutting. In a relatively small way stuff
worth only 12s. a ton was- worked there
for many years. It is a proposition that
just balances on the margin—an unex-
pected pennyweight in the right direction
could make it one of the biggest low-
grade propositions in Australia.
* * *
The Mt. Moran lodes, near Forsayth
(N.Q.), of which the chief is the Finger
Print, are developing nicely. Over 300
tons of ore has been raised by the
various parties. The Government assisted
be renovating the old 10-head battery,
and the last crushing figures available
were 170 tons for 970 z. of gold. The
Finger Print, which is up to 4ft. in width,
has thus far averaged nearly 12dwt. a
ton.
* * * *
There is evidence of gold-bearing stone
in five places in the Deborah, Bendigo
(Vic.), says Herbert Gepp, the chairman,
and values as low as 3dwt. would provide
E small profit. Jim Hibberd, the manager,
expects to find a payable reef between
the 535 ft. and 630 ft. levels. The new
west back disclosed in the crosscut at
535 ft. is certainly very encouraging. At
Monument Hill, about a mile away, a
gold-bearing reef was found below an-
other, which corresponded in depth to
the new reef below the 435 ft. level in
the Deborah. W. H. Cundy, who recently
examined the mine in conjunction with
Dr. Loftus Hills, thinks that another pay-
able ore body should be met with in
the Deborah between 700 ft. and 1000 ft.
In two adjoining mines, New Blue and
Great Southern, payable stone has been
encountered at 740 ft. The market, which
fancies the co.’s prospects, prices the
10s. shares paid to 6s. 9d. at 16s. or there-
abouts.

New Glenfine Gold has been put off
the stocks in Melbourne with a capital
of £25,000 in 10s. shares, of which
40,000 are offered at 2s. application and
a like amount on allotment. The vendor
takes 6000 paids and £SQO in cash, and
the promoters 4000 shares credited as
paid to 4s. each. The property, which is
at Pitfield Plains, 33 miles s.-w. of Ben-
digo, includes portion of the Glenfine
Consols and Glenfine South leases.
According to W. Baragwanath, Vic. Sec-
retary for Mines, a large part of the co.’s
area consists of promising alluvial. Jn
the past the lead was worked with good
results further up.

To avoid forfeiting its leases at Mt.
Paynter (S. Aus.), where ore carrying the
radium-bearing minerals autunite and tor-
benite exists, Australian Radium Corp.,
which has run out of cash, is to be taken
over by a new no-liability concern of the
same name for 10,000 fully-paid pound
shares. Also, to enable the deposits to
be further developed and tested, 40,000
new shares, called to Is. each, are to be
offered. In the past the co. has been
unable to sell its radium at a profit in
competition with Union Miniere, the big
Belgian radium-producing concern, with
mines in the Belgian Congo. It is now
proposed to market the 10 p.c. uranium
oxide concentrates, which are worth
about £2BB (sterling) per ton. This is a
simpler and less expensive method of
developing the deposits.
Claude de Bernales and his friends
have just launched their fourth Westra-
lian gold-mining venture on the London
market within the last 12 months. This
is Commonwealth Mining and Finance,
Ltd. Capital is a million in ss. shares,
of which 1,800,000 are offered, a quarter
of the issue being reserved for subscrip-
tion in Australia. Every two shares of
the present issue carry an option to take
up another one at par within six months,
at 6s. within a year and at 7s. 6d. within
18 months. The co. has bought the Sand
Queen and Bayley’s Reward (W.A.) for
£47,000 cash plus 600,000 shares, and
has taken options on three other shows —
two in the West and one in the Northern
Territory. At the moment one doubt is
whether the capital structure will prove
to be top-heavy. On the board are ex-
Westralian Governor Campion (chair-
man), John Waddington (chairman of
Great Boulder), Claude de Bernales,
Louis Cutbill (De Bernales’s right-hand
supporter in London), and E. Protheroe
Jones (director of Boulder Perseverance
and Golden Horseshoe).
* * * *
Western Mining Corp. has unexpec-
tedly abandoned its option on Tindals,
at Coolgardie (W.A.). Herman Mandel-
stam, the vendor, has since announced by
cable from London that someone else is
nibbling at the show. Tindals was
worked from 1897 to 1916 by a Mel-
bourne co. which got 35,1710 z. of gold
from 143,000 tons, but didn’t pay a div.
It then met with reverses and gave up.
Little systematic prospecting at depth was
done on the property until the Western
Mining Corp. took a hand.
% * * *
Meekatharra (W.A.) has attracted the
attention of G. W. Osborne, representa-
tive of a Sydney syndicate of Malayan
tin cos. which already holds a wad of
shares in the New Venture Co. He has
taken an option over the Ingliston
Alberts, and development is to com-
mence immediately on the east lode, the
most favorable location to date. Inci-
dentally, Osborne is working in conjunc-
tion with Johnstone, of the Perth Phar
Lap Syndicate, who has secured a pro-
perty south of the Fenian in the same
district.

Arrangements for the alteration of
Peninsula’s dredge to enable it to dig
to 50ft. and to handle 150,000 c.y.
monthly have been put in hand in
London. The work, to cost about
£25,000, should be completed early next
year. The co. has £17,000 in hand, and
should have no difficulty about the bal-
ance. Meanwhile, the machine is to be
turned into the high-grade portion of the
Nai Hoot leases, recently bought from
Langsuen Tin, an English concern, for
132,925 fully-paid 15s. shares. The pur-
chase has given the co. 32,000,000 c.y. of
0.751 b. dirt, with an average depth of
39yft. The assay value is 72.8 p.c. metal-
lic tin. The co.’s present monthly quota
is 37.7 tons of t.o. F. G. and E. H.
Pratten and Malcolm Newman have
joined the board.

something to say about it later on.
“Red Ensign”
The chief defects of this British film
at Sydney State are its padding and pro-
paganda.
It concerns the battle waged against
foreign competition by a British ship-
builder (Leslie Banks) who has invented
a new type of cargo boat. His fellow-
directors, including a supercilious peer,
scorn his ideas. He is aided at times
and opposed at other times by the largest
female shareholder (Carol Goodner),
who is engaged to the peer.
He smashes a strike by strong-arm
“Hips, Hips, Hooray”
This Wheeler and Woolsey film at the
Capitol provides further evidence of our
Chief Censor’s capacity for straining at
gnats and swallowing caravans of camels.
In a recent “Australian” production
which made a half-hearted attempt to
compete with the American product in
eroticism, he censored a girl with a bath-
towel wrapped round her ; “Hips, Hips,
Hooray” contains herds of practically
naked girls. In the Australian film a
shot of a man on a cliff was censored
because he was supposed to be looking
at a girl bathing; at the Capitol half
a dozen girls are revealed in baths. A
lovers’ kiss was banned for export in
the Australian film, yet an astonishingly
suggestive osculatory sequence has been
passed in the Hollywood importation.
When not cavorting about with girls
who show their hips, and most other
parts of their excellent figures, W. and
W. hawk lipsticks, smash up the office
of a plutocrat whom they have got rid
of on the false pretence that his house
is on fire, and are chased across the
U.S.A. by detectives on suspicion of hav-
ing stolen 10,000 dollars. At one stage
they become unwilling competitors in a
transcontinental motor race, and make
hilarious asses of themselves in a run-
away car. Thelma Tod and Dorothy Lee
look nice as their girls.
“Dick Turpin”
With a few changes this film, in which
Victor McLaglen plays Turpin, would
have made a good burlesque. As it is,
the stagy dialogue and situations got
plenty of laughs on the first night. Mc-
Laglen is a couple of stone too heavy for
Black Bess, and she has obviously just
come off the grass. The mythical ride
to York is performed at a hand-gallop
throughout, and when the mare founders
her owner doesn’t even undo the girths.
Altogether the highwayman’s horse-
mastership is a disgrace to his profes-
sion ; particularly his flash cowboy
habit of taking flying leaps at his mounts’
backs.
They’re all bad, but McLaglen is easily
the worst. The noisy self-assurance which
he exploited in so many Hollywood war
films, and which would have been in
character here, is missing. The butcher’s
boy who went to the bad is portrayed as
an elderly sentimentalist. McLaglen
gives one the impression that he is
ashamed of the whole business.
“I Loved a Woman”
Because of the film war this talkie
was released at Sydney Arcadia (where
present deponent saw it) and other minor
houses.
The story opens in Greece in the
’nineties. Edward G. Robinson, the heir-
presumptive of an American beef king, is
pottering joyfully among the ruins. His
father dies and he has to return to his
kingdom. His idealism fails to impress
his wife, Genevieve Tobin, who is charit-
able for sweet publicity’s sake, and he
turns for solace to Kay Francis, a rising
operatic star. Miss Francis departs for
Europe, but not before she has made her
admirer promise that he will fight his
way to the topmost pinnacle of the meat
industry. And now his high ideals topple.
Roosevelt accuses him of supplying the
army with bad beef in the Spanish-
American War. Kay Francis cold-
shoulders him. He goes on making
money. Swollen with power, he over-
steps himself, and in the depression we
find him facing ruin. Genevieve Tobin,
who has been nursing her hatred of him
for 20 years, deserts him. He flees from
justice.
The end shows him in Greece again—
a senile derelict. Kay Francis turns up,
PRINCE EDWARD TALKIES.

methods, but suffers a rebuff when the
hirelings of an unpatriotic shipowner
blow up his nearly completed first vessel.
Funds run out; credit is refused ; he is
forced to raise cash by forgery and goes
to quod.
Released, he finds himself a national
hero, Carol Goodner waiting to be his
wife, the unpatriotic shipowner behind
iron bars and the first of his cargo boats
ready to be launched.
Banks is good as a man of action, but
colorless as a lover. Carol Goodner
plays smoothly, and it would be hard to
find a better arch-rogue than Alfred
Drayton.
“Aunt Sally”
Cicely Courtneidge is there or there-
abouts during most of the 87 minutes
which this one lasts. She is first seen as
a lady from Cardiff who wants a job
as an entertainer in a London night club
run by Sam Hardy, whom gangsters have
chased out of the U.S.A. But she proves
a dud. Next she appears as a masterful
servant in Sam’s palatial apartment.
Then she disguises herself as a French
actress, gets a job in the night club and
dazzles Sam by her abilities.
The settings are lavish ; the musical
numbers are fairly catchy; there are
ballet girls galore, and scenes from
above, below and every point of the
compass showing them shaking their un-
impeachable legs.
“Devil Tiger”
Another jungle film. The wrestling
critic saw it at the Lyceum and voted it
as good as anything at Leichhardt, but
the girl friend missed the referee’s turn.
There are about a dozen bouts—the
main event between a lion and a tiger
ends in a draw.
Preliminaries —python v. tiger, hyena v.
black bear, etc. —are also drawn. The
hyena is hardly in the same class as the
other contestants, but snarls well. The
ring is a banked-up clearing, so that
neither scrapper can leave before the
final bell. There’s romance in it, too —
one girl and two men. The girl friend
liked that all right, but she still wanted
to see the ref. lose his shirt.
“Happy Ever After”
Disappointing. It has Lilian Harvey
and Jack Hulbert, who have both done
well lately. He’s a window-cleaner ; she,
an acrobat who wants to go on the
pictures. She’s broke, so he and a friend
take her home —they live in old railway
carriages—and both fall for her. Sonnie
Hale does better than either of them as
the odd man out.
“Fashions of 1934”
In this Melb. Capitol exhibit 14 or 15
motives are inextricably mixed. There
is the gang of racketeers who intercept
the latest Paris fashions, copy them and
ruin the business of New York costume
purveyors. There are three or four love
affairs as recklessly experimental as the
costumes abovementioned. There is the
evident desire of the sartorial expert to
use the plot as an excuse for mannequin
parades. Also other motives. The re-
sultant mess has the elements of every
sort of success except a dramatic one.
Nevertheless, it has its amusing moments,
as when William Powell and his asso-
ciates sit in the parlor of a Paris robes
genius photographing the models with a
camera concealed in a walking-stick.
There are a fan dance in which 200 danc-
ing and singing beauties dance and sing
according to Hollywood standards of
beauty ; a hall of human harps; the
apparition of Venus and her galley-
slaves afloat on an ocean of silk ; and
other spectacles which bring some of the
saliva of surprise to the jaded palate of
surfeit.
“General John Regan”
The film version of this celebrated
story makes a fine comedy. Billing (Ben
Welden), a Yankee, lands in the sleepy
Irish village of Ballymoy, and, finding
the place dull, starts a story that he has
come to get particulars for a biography
of General John Regan, the village’s
greatest son, whose military exploits in
a mythical foreign country are known
everywhere but in his birthplace. Dr.
O’Grady, the local medico (Henry
Edwards), seizes on the idea with the
delight of a born humorist, the legend
takes shape and, in due course, a statue
is erected to the non-existent general.
The humor of the story is inherent and
not dependent on wisecracking or slap-
stick, there is a wide range of delightful
characters, the casting couldn’t be
bettered and the audience paid its
tribute on the night the writer attended
by laughing half the dialogue out of its
own eardrums.
“Sorrell and Son”
Warwick Deeping’s of an Eng-
lish public-school man began as a book,
turned up as a play, a silent, and now re-
appears as a talkie at Melb. Athenaeum.
In each reincarnation it has acquired fresh
veils of sentiment. Accepting the senti-
ment in its own terms, and as served up
by H. B. Warner, it almost convinces.
Warner is quiet, restrained and natural.
If he were melodramatic the tale would
become nauseating. The cameraman’s
transforming art here reaches its highest
peak of efficiency. We see Captain Sor-
rell, M.C., gradually swallowing his
gentlemanly instincts as he tramps down
the social scale in search of post-war
employment, till he finishes as an assist-
ant porter in a country hotel, tyrannised
over by a villainous upper porter. Then
he commences to rise again, till he
becomes a hotel manager, while Peter
Penrose-Hugh Williams, as the doted-on
son, rises with him and becomes a lead-
ing surgeon. His first operation in an
ornate operating theatre is presented with
the last degree of screen realism. Here
the pathos of the old man’s position

reaches its apotheosis, and the subse-
quent scene where the son is obliged to
give his father a lethal dose to spare
him unbearable suffering is in the nature
of an anti-climax. In terms of actual
human psychology, the film tells more
lies in a minute than a street weighing
machine in a twelvemonth, but in terms
of its own father-love, gentlemen-always-
play-the-game conventions, it is an out-
standing British achievement.
Sundry Shows
Grace Lane, Jane Wood, Gerald

Sir Hamilton Hatty’s series of four

Melbourne, on Saturday. There will be
75 performers, and all Australia will be

Except that Jim Gerald is now appear-
ing as Cinderella in a potted panto., there
is no particular change at the house of
.Tivoli in Melbourne. Some of James’s
turns are old friends, but the show surges
along on a wave of girl and gagging to
a conclusion satisfactory to all but a few
embittered cynics. A newcomer is
Charles Sherman, who patters at the
piano. Miss Frieda Bohning warbles
“Sing, Joyous Bird” with a voice that
surprises with its freshness.

Percy Grainger has been giving great
music, both highbrow and popular, at
Adelaide Town Hall. By contrast, a
Baby Hakendorf is playing the violin
at the Tivoli; aged only five, she has
been approved by experts as promising
to be the real thing.

Adelaide Repertory has revived the old
“Importance of Being Earnest” as a
period piece. Wilde’s wit was in the safe
hands of Matthews and Sando, and the
1895 costumes had charm as worn by
Elizabeth Campbell and Muriel Marks.
Cyril Riley is a greatly-improved actor,
and the Rep. has made a find in Betty
Diamond, who looked a very young Du
Maurier figure in flounces.

The Pouishnoff-Stevens partnership
continues to attract large audiences to
the Sydney Town Hall, and to send them
home enthusiastic but hungry for more.
On Thursday the singer gave a varied
programme: three Shakspearean songs set
by Roger Quilter, Schubert’s “Der Dop-
pelganger” and samples of Brahms and
Schumann. On Saturday he followed
Handel’s “Hear Me, Ye Winds and
Waves” with several modern pieces, in-
cluding Masefield’s “By a Bierside” in
Armstrong Gibbs’s setting. Pouishnoff’s
Chopin playing on Thursday was parti-
cularly impressive, and on Saturday his
rendering of the Bach-Busoni Chaconne,
substituted by request for the first three
pieces on the scheduled programme, was
among the best work he has presented
here. Further concerts will be given on
Thursday and Saturday nights.
“F.S.”: Melbourne is to have a cen-
tenary exhibition of the works of Mrs.
Goodwin. The lady was born in Mel-
bourne in 1854- She married a wealthy
New Yorker, and took up painting as a
hobby. Her husband has made the city
of her birth a free present of 140 of her
pictures, and will pay all the expenses
hanging thereto. As to the value of
the works, the Nat. Gallery has little to
say. They are reported to be unsuitable
for the National collection, but an Ameri-
can authority has reported that they show
“remarkable evidence of untrained skill,”
whatever that may mean.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Milne Bay”: That was a pretty little
cablegram which told how the master
of a steamer full of tourists trying to
make Jersey, where the cows come from,
in a fog was only saved from piling up
his ship by the sound of a rooster’s crow-
ing ashore. It recalls old British New
Guinea days, when I used to sail out
of Samarai up the north-east coast under
masters who held a “dogbarker’s ticket.”
When darkness fell on those reef-infested
seas, the devoted mariners made inshore
and listened attentively. Presently the
usual chorus of yelps and yowls in which
all Papuan village dogs delight would
fall upon the ear. Our navigating expert
would carefully analyse it, just as an
“The cheek o’ yer to call my place a
typical pigsty!”
orchestral conductor mentally dissects
the different instrumental parts from each
other while blending them in a whole.
Presently he would say, “Ah, yes; that’s
Ussi-Ussi” —or whatever it was. “Good
anchorage there, and the girls ain’t too
bad-lookin’, either.”
* * * *
“P.R.”: “Top-Rail’s” sozzled men-
agerie (B. 25/4/’34) reminds me of a
kangaroo mascot we had in one of our
heavy batteries during the war. Joey
developed a taste for beer, and most of
his time was spent within shouting dis-
tance of officers’ mess or canteen. He
managed his hops well while in Aus-
tralia, but when he followed the battery
to Blighty the English brew proved his
undoing. After a hectic night in the can-
teen, he tried to sleep it off in the snow.
# *
“Northampton”: The plain turkey, or
lesser bustard, one of Australia’s finest
game birds, is reported to be fading out
in one of its few remaining strongholds
—the great plains of
Western Queensland.
This handsome bird
lays in the grass, and,
in these days of smaller
holdings and more in-
tensive stocking, the
sheep destroy the eggs,
while the fox, ever
pressing towards the
north, sees that many
of the chicks, flightless
in their early stages,
never reach maturity.
Brisbane has just ac-
quired a pair of fledged
young birds raised from
chickhood by a Long-
reach squatter who dis-
covered their nest.
TJiey are considered a
great curiosity there to-
day, though 40 years
ago they figured on the
menu of every decent
Brisbane hotel, and could be bought
cheaply in any of the shops which those
days specialised in wild game.
“E.R.”: Polynesian humor is sometimes
subtle, even if unconscious. Discussing
the political squabbles of Samoa with
one of the leading malcontents, I tried to
enlighten him on a few points. Sione,
like all Samoans, is convinced that his
homeland is the hub of the universe. To
persuade him that it is not, I pointed it
out on a large map, and asked him
whether it was reasonable to expect the
world to worry about the troubles of his
people. He gazed ardently at the thing
for a few moments and then turned to
me. “Yes,” he said, “but who drew the
map?”
* * * *
“Parrot”: I note with approval that
a diver who descended into the depths
of the sea somewhere outside Sydney
was attacked by leatherjackets, which
very properly resented his invasion of
their own particular domain on the sea
bottom. The Jackies are close relatives
of my own, and I must say that their
determined stand against the trespass,
which resulted in the intruder being
swiftly removed to the upper world
whence he came, will meet with the ap-
proval of all the queer fish in the sea.
For many years a family allied to ours,
the gropers, have been doing their best
to discourage these divers in Torres Strait
and contiguous tropical waters by biting
their hands off when opportunity offered.
The divers have learned to combat this
by keeping their hands closely pressed
to their sides until the danger passes. In
the case I have quoted, my relatives, did
not bother about taking the whole hand
at once, but started removing it in mouth-
fuls, with the desired result. It is about
time we poor fish struck out for the free-
dom of the seas.
* * * *
“Birkdale”: I fall into line with “Boga-
duck” (B. 9/4/’34) when he says that
soup made from N.S.W. “scallops” is
equal to the much-boomed toheroa beach
mussels from M.L. The scallops are only
“They shouldn’t waste millions on roads when the ocean is in such a dreadful
condition.”
the “cockles” which are famous in Britain
and Europe as most appetising shellfish,
not only for soup-making, but for dishes
of many descriptions, all of which are
well worth eating. As a boy I spent
some schooldays at Southport, in Lan-
cashire, which, with its tide-exposed sand-
flats, struck me as being the home-town
of the cockles. At our tuck-shop we
used to buy cockle pies, scalloped cockles
and, best of all, pickled cockles. I would
give something, though my digestion is
not what it was, to be allowed a fair
spin at a jar of pickled cockles such as
we used to get for 6d. in the days when
A. N. Hornby was Consul in Lancashire.
* * * *
“Skeet” : Among 30-odd men in a gold-
prospectors’ camp at Waanyarra (Vic.)
the names of four explorers are repre-
sented: Burke, Wills, Livingstone and
Shackleton.
*** * *
“Spare Walton”: Beach fishermen at
Southport (Q.) were staggered the other
day when one of their number
landed a fish no one had seen
before. All looked at each
other with a wild surmise, until
someone identified the thing as
Patcecus fronte, better known
as the “Red Indian” in N.S.W.,
where it is sometimes caught on
the reefs. Bright red in color,
the creature looks just the kind
of fish a man would haul out
of his boots after a week’s
steady addiction to “plonk”—a mixture
of methylated spirit and “pinkie”—so
the perturbation of the unsophisticated
Bananalanders can be easily understood.
■Je * * *
“Wild-dog”: Bushmen from other
parts of the continent are often amazed
at the way the natives of the dry interior
of Westralia apparently travel long dis-
tances without water. Actually, they dig
up the roots of a tree which grows in
those regions ; the roots retain water dur-
ing long dry periods. They are broken
up into pieces about Ift. long ; these are
placed on end in drinking vessels, into
which the water oozes. Sometimes the
water is sucked out. The roots are
tapped only when there is no surface
water handy.
* * * *
“Bar K.”: When does a magpie start
to grow old? Over 17 years ago a
mother maggie, nesting in a tree near my
home in one of Sydney’s outer suburbs,
was shot in the wing. For nearly 12
months she lived mostly in my garden
and grew fairly tame. Although the
wing was permanently deformed, making
identification easy, she gradually re-
gained the use of it, and has been nest-
ing near by regularly ever since. At the
ruling rates for vegetables, will Maggie
or I live long enough to see my farmlet
paid for? If not, what is a reasonable
span for the bird?
“Powlathanga” (B. 11/4/’34) started
it:
“Ben Nevis”: “P.” says he found one pouched
mouse on the Burdekin Tableland (N.Q.) and
you might get one if you hacked down a
thousand gum-trees. We didn’t need to do
that when we lived four miles out of Moss
Vale (N.S.W.). The cats often brought them
in.
“Larrapinta”: The feather-tailed phalanger,
or flying-mouse, is common in the wide belt of
scrub which stretches across S.A. and western
Vic., from the back of Kingston to Horsham.
In the daytime they are frequently found when
splitting posts or felling trees, and at night I
have had them fly into the cab of my lorry or
into the tent, in both cases dazzled by the light.
And tame! I have put down a book and turned
the lamp low, and within a few minutes have
had one sitting on a finger and licking honey off
a stick.
“F.S.W.": Ten years ago there were thousands
of flying mice in the forest country around the
Grand Canyon between Goulburn (N.S.W.) and
the coast. Bee trees felled would be found to
have comb built on top of a nest of leaves
that the mice had made in the hollow tree-trunk.
Then something happened; for months mice
could be found lying dead singly through the
bush. The larger phalanger (or sugar squirrel)
disappeared about the same time.
“Searchlight”: Near Ebor, Guy Fawkes
(N.S.W.), one moonlight night I saw a great all-
in scrap between two flying mice. It was a case
of the eternal triangle, I judged; anyway, an-
other feathertail looked on, taking a flying leap
to the next tree and back from time to time.
The fight lasted 15 rounds and one combatant
fell off the limb dead. I caught the other as he
was falling, but he died 10 minutes later.
* * *
“Airline” : Horse-buying is child’s play
compared with camel-buying. A good
man will glance at a horse’s eye and tell
you his disposition ; all camels look alike.
You know a “striker” only when a pad
as big as a plate gets home on you, or
when he grabs you while you’re not look-
ing. It takes a keen judge to tell whether
a camel is gone in the legs. That is the
common fault, generally caused by over-
loading. If he is not properly broken in
to “hoosh down” you’ll need a step-
ladder, and if you want him for a
“string” you have to be sure his gait is
in harmony with the rest of the team.
Otherwise he’ll break your heart. A
tender pad is another point to beware of.
It will take six months to heal if it is
raw.
* * * *
“S.G.”: The scarlet-chested parrot,
of which only a few pairs are in cap-
tivity, is, apart from its rarity, one of
the hardest birds in the bush to snare.
Inhabiting only the driest and most
isolated portions of the continent, it has
a habit peculiarly in keeping with its
arid surroundings. It doesn’t drink.
Even where numbers of them were
known to exist, none ever visited the
water. They are extremely shy. A bird-
man in Centralia recently thought his
fortune was made when he located a
patch of them preparing to breed. He
decided not to molest them until the
young ones arrived, but within a couple
of days every nest was deserted.
THE WOODMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s nothing finer that I know than with
an axe to make my way
To where the tall, straight timbers grow on
some clear, crisp autumnal day,
And there to choose a likely tree, not twisted,
gnarled or tough and dry;
To let the keen blade cut its fill and make the
white chips fly;
To catch the glitter, of the sun upon the axe-
head swinging high;
To suck deep draughts of hillside air
As brown arms swinging, stripped and bare,
Drive home the strokes that crash and tear and
make the white chips fly;
To catch the scent of new-hewn chips, to watch
the wide scarf sinking straight,
The rhythmic sway from supple hips, in every
stroke each ounce of weight,
And down the gullies from the hills to hear the
echoes make reply
As every stroke reverberates and makes the
white chips fly.
The minah chattering from his tree, the wedge-
tail hanging in the sky
Are not a whit more blithe and gay
Than I, as on this autumn day
With flashing blade I hew away and make the
white chips fly.
The autumn sun across the hills is mild and
mellow here to-day
As lavishly its warmth it spills, ’twixt rifted
cloudbanks dull and grey;
My axe is keen, soft wood below... .and yet, no
matter how I try,
The strokes fall heavily and slow, and still no
white chips fly.
No more I taste the wine of life, the cup I
‘ sipped is drained and dry:
I might have known ’twould be no good;
I never did nor ever could
Raise zest for chopping morning wood, so let
the white chips lie.
VICTORIA.
A. G. BURNET.


“Cayman”: As chairman . of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Crocodiles, 1 must protest against the
treatment being meted out to an inmate
of Taronga Zoo —a lady, too! A pic-
ture in a Sydney evening paper shows
the unhappy female being roughly man-
handled while a large lump of meat is
being pushed down her neck with a long
stick. One had thought that this forcible-
feeding business had died with the suf-
fragrette movement. The excuse now
is the same as given then—the confinee
refuses to eat. Cannot those carrying
out these abominable tactics realise that
fresh meat is as abhorrent to a decently-
brought-up crocodile as sweet German
champagne to a bon viveur ? The croco-
dile likes its food high—just as do the
gourmets of England, who demand that
a pheasant be hung by the tail in the
larder until it falls to the floor, and that
grouse, partridge, venison and prime
mutton be similarly served. All that is
needed is to give the crocodile a deepish
pool, with several feet of mud on the
bottom or under the bank, and to throw

“Bucko”: About 20 years ago young
perch fry were released in the railway
dam at Newnes Junction (N.S.W.). Some
recent catches went over 61b. Not much
of a rate of growth, but the successful
anglers didn’t worry about that.

“Old Q.”: This being the N.Q. tourist
season, there may be interest in the story
of two holiday-makers who cast up in
Brisbane from the south. They were
“I’ve had enough ! Your blasted comedian just dropped a brick on my head.”
“Did he mean it, or was he only joking?”
discovered travelling under a tarpaulin
on a goods truck close to Brisbane. At
a subsequent public appearance they told
the official interrogator that they had
come all the way from Sydney, and had
intended to go as far as Cairns, as they
had often done before. “How then,”
said the official, “did you hope to get
back from Cairns?” “Dead easy,” was
the reply. “You just jump one of
the sugar boats.” Here the prosecut-
ing policeman chipped in wearily:
“This is known among the crowd as
the ‘round trip,’ your Worship.” His
Worship made it seven days each.

“B. Sneeze”: At Hat Head (N.S.W.
North Coast) there is a cliff over 200 ft.
high from which the sandy bottom of
the sea can be seen for miles. One
morning, when the water was particularly
calm, I took a pot shot with a service
rifle at a shark and scored a direct hit.
The monster threshed about for some
time and then lay still, staining the water
with blood. I could see five sharks within
a radius of a mile; and inside of
three minutes every one of them
was swimming towards the victim.
Within ten minutes there was nothing
left but five squabbling sharks which
circled slowly round in the bloody water.

“King T.”: A white cow nearly always
bears brindle calves, but I was recently
introduced to a white cow at Calliope
(C.Q.) that had borne a white, a red and
a black calf, all without blemish in their
coloring. A red cow in the same district
has two snow-white calves ; the father,
a brindle bull, had a white mother.
* * * *
“Searchlight”: Walking through the
bush near Inverell (N.S.W.), 1 noticed
the peculiar antics of a couple of crows
about a petrol-tin. They flew away
swearing as I approached it. A small,
moving, black object protruded from the
hole at the top ; it was a crow’s head.
Released when I cut the tin with my
knife, the bird ran around groggily. It
had red legs. Evidently it had squeezed
in when young, the ragged edge of the
hole preventing escape. The parent birds
flew down and dragged it up to a gum
limb. They must have fed that young-
ster through the hole for at least three
months.

“Walmer”: A mate and 1 were
addicted to answering advertisements
(B. 18/4/’34) when we were boys.
We became tooth-paste and shaving-
cream connoisseurs, acquired valu-
able information about the treat-
ment of alcoholism, liver and kidney
complaints, and learned how to develop
—or reduce, if necessary—our busts. The
end came when our request for a sample
tin of lactogen brought a trained nurse
in full regalia to my front door. She
had the asked-for article in her hand,
and she proposed a personal inspection
of “the little one.” After that we re-
turned to catapults and kites.

“Larua”: “Jack’s. Track” (B. 25/4/’34)
is perfectly right. The fibres of which a
tree is composed develop from the inner
surface of the sapwood, so growth is
outward. The terminal points.of stem
and branches make the upward growth.
Surveyors’ marks are often overgrown by
timber and bark, but when again ex-
posed are exactly the same height from
the ground as when originally cut. River
gums on the banks of the Lower Murray
(S.A.) still show the marks where abos.
cut bark for making their craft. At Port
Macquarie (N.S.W.) you can see on the
boles of the grey mangrove the marks
left by abos. after cutting out their
shields ; the marks are on the same level
as when the incisions were made. This
tree has a ply structure —the only one of
its kind in the world —and the black-
fellow found it out.
* # * *
“Bloss”: I’ve got a novel sheep-dog
My mare’s four-month-old foal, after
watching the dogs working sheep for a
week or so, suddenly joined in the
muster. She followed the dogs so keenly
that she soon learned what “come be-
hind,” “go back” and “sit” meant. I’ve
found her invaluable in yarding ewes
“You ought to buy an encyclopcedia for the boy now he’s going to school”
“Not me! Let him walk, like I did.”
and lambs. She trots quietly and per-
sistently backwards and forwards till she
works them through the gate. They’re
not nearly so touchy as when barking
dogs are present, and consequently there’s
no breaking away of panic-stricken
lambs.
* * * *
“Wang”: Sam and I were walking
across an open, treeless plain, a couple of
miles from the homestead, when we started
up a hare. Sam’s greyhound dog Roy
gave chase as it
made tracks for a
range of hills half a
mile away. Before
it was half-way there
Roy had got within
a couple of yards of
it. Suddenly the hare
turned, Roy at its
tail, and kept on
turning till it had
described a circle,
probably about 20ft.
across. Roy kept
close for a while,
but when Brownie
had done the circu-
lar waltz six times
the hound had
dropped back, and
seemed to be get-
ting shorter in his
stride. Then Brownie
shot off like an
arrow for the hills,
and went scurrying
up the side. When
we reached Roy he
was still trotting
round in a circle,
nose to the ground
and a puzzled expression on his face.
Then he dropped and lay helpless. We
had to wait half an hour before he had
recovered from dizziness.
* * * *
“Bendee”: Here’s a suggestion for the
man with no snares or gun who wants
rabbit-pie for dinner. Wait till the
bunnies are out feeding, then sneak up
and fill all the openings of a burrow—
not at the top, but about an arm’s length
down. Then break round behind where
they are grazing, kick up a din, and rush
them up to the burrow. They’ll dive in ;
and the rest is easy.
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: Dentifrices were
little known to savage Binghis, but some
tribes used mixtures in cases of gum-
affection. One about Goodooga (N.S.W.)
way and some others farther along the
river towards Mungindi were very prone
to a complaint like pyorrhoea, and treated
gums and teeth by rubbing with a 50-50
compound of pulped nardoo seeds and
gum leaves, brought to fermentation by
exposure to the sun. Some N.Q. tribes
used the berries of the kapok-tree simi-
larly, and in cases where a mouth com-
plaint was exceptionally painful added
crushed pituri leaves as a sedative. Still
another lot in the vicinity of Geraldton
(W.A.) evolved a paste from mashed
spinifex and finely-ground sea shells.
These rose to the dignity of a rude tooth-
brush made from a small wing-bone with
a few feathers burnt short attached.
Nearly all coastal tribes knew the value
of sea water in cases of mouth soreness.
Most Melville Islanders clean their teeth
with ashes; but they’re natural-born
swanks.
* * * *
“Findy”: Courage in the cups? A
couple of years ago a party of South
Australians were camping along the
Murray over the Christmas vacation.
New Year’s Eve found them on the Vic-
torian side, miles from nowhere, but with
a plentiful supply of wine. When the
stuff had done its work they rowed hilari-
ously across the stream to the N.S.W.
bank, where they yelled in chorus to the
great empty spaces of the Ma State:
“Now then, New South Wales, bring out
your Lang!”
$ $ $ *
“The Breaker”: If you are doubtful
about the swimming abilities of a horse
when about to cross a deep stream, un-
couple the bridle rein on the down-
stream side, and, holding the end of it
in one hand, start the horse in and grab
his tail. A slight pressure now and then
on the rein will keep the prad swimming
straight, and, being off his back, you are
not hindering his swimming. But don’t
take it on unless you can swim.
* * * *
“Airline”: My two kittens feed at my
feet —one contentedly, the other swear-
ing angrily, the embodiment of feline
ferocity. I know what it means —he'll
“go bush.” Of all our domesticated
animals, puss is the one most liable to
leave us, and best equipped to fend for
himself. His chances are much better
than a dog’s. Puss, for instance, can go
without water for a long time. 1 have
encountered cats in the heart of the Great
Victoria Desert, miles from the nearest
soaks; but how many stockmen have
seen their dogs perish because they were
deprived of a drink for even a few hours!
It takes quite a bit to feed a husky dog,
too, while puss can always rustle up a
grasshopper or two, or an odd lizard
here and there.
A BRIDE FROM THE BUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’ve a grand home, on a broad street, but to me
it is grim and aloof;
There’s a bronze plate on the big gate and the
clothes-line's high on the roof.
I long for the sight of a clothes-line from tree
to tree in the scrub.
And the men’s shirts and the white sheets and
my arms deep down in the tub.
I hate the nights and the bright lights and the
din of the crowded street,
And the harsh clang and the dull roar and the
surge of the restless feet.
I’d change them for a lone ride on the hills
where the cattle roam,
And a dog’s bark and a hand-shake at the door
of the old bush home.
And in grey days, when the rain falls a-pelting
down on the roofs,
1 think of sheep at the creek bridge and the
pattering of their hoofs;
In fancy I see the old bridge, with its decking
of curving logs,
And the dust cloud and the big Mock, pressed
hard by the yelping dogs.
There are bright days and a calm sea where
the waves break soft on the sand,
When the birds sing and the buds burst and
there’s beauty on either hand....
But the sun fades and the rain comes, while the
clouds roll lower and lower,
And my heart yearns and the bush calls and
the days pass slower and slower.

PRINCE SOMEONE’S ADVANCE
AGENT SENDS HIS IMPRESSIONS
TO THE FIFTH EQUERRY.
Vll.— Canberra.
It would be wiser for the Prince not
to visit Canberra until towards the end
of his tour. It will remind him too
much of London, and it would not do
for him to get homesick too soon.
Situated on the banks of the Pongo
Bongo, the place is rich in Old World
memories, and lacks the garish newness
of most Australian cities.
If the Prince should be eating sand-
wiches outside Parliament House, he must
be careful not to throw his crusts on the
greensward. I did this, and it took quite
a lot of explaining.
No Test- matches are played in Can-
berra, there is no stadium, and Mr. Lang
doesn’t speak there. Nevertheless, it is
not entirely devoid of culture. The De-
bating Society is a very live body, and
the Local Circulating Library, under the
supervision of the Minister for Customs,
has the stodgiest collection of banned
books outside Boston, Mass.
The Prince will be able. to spend a
merry afternoon at the Quoit Club, and
he will find the Politicians’ Parlor at the
Hotel Kurrajong the scene of some of
the .wittiest and most exhilarating con-
versation in the Commonwealth.
There is to be a parade of the Oldest
Inhabitants during his Highness’s visit,
and all the claimants for the title will be
there. Senator Pearce is a hot favorite,
though, some think he-should be disquali-
fied as, being a. member, he has an
excuse for being there.
The Prince will be shown the Speaker’s
Chair, which is a replica of that at West-
minster, and Parliament House, which
is a replica of a
Flinders-lane ware-
house. If he hap-
pens to be there
between 10 a.m.
and noon on a
second Tuesday, or
3 and 4 p.m. on a
fourth Thursday,
he will possibly
find the House sit-
ting. In any case,
he will see all the
members on ’ the
week - end Mel-
bourne express.
Being a military
man, his Highness
will be very inter-
ested in Mount
Stro m 1 o. This
point is the key
position in Sena-
tor Pearce’s scheme
for the defence of
Australia. He con-
si de r s that the
whole of the De-
fence Department
(civil) staff could
retire there and
hold out for an
indefinite period, practically unmolested.
The Prince would be well advised not ;
to take his golf sticks to Canberra. Mr.
Lyons has recently taken up the game,
and is pretty hot stuff.

HIS MISTAKE.
For four years he had not seen her —
four years of wandering. But, now that
he had come back, he could show her
that in all his travels he had never for-
gotten; always,
next to his heart,
he had borne that
little treasure that
she had given him.
“Darling, I can
prove to you how
1 have clung to
our memories. See
here,” he cried, and
he brought out the
locket.
. There was no
answering light in
her eyes; rather
was her aspect one
of coldness. Un-
deterred he touch-
ed the spring, and
the locket flew
open, showing the
golden lock en-
shrined within.
“Don’t you re-
member giving it
to me? I have
kept it always with
me,” he whispered
soul fully.
“You are mak-
ing a mistake;
that is not my
hair,” she said with
a coldness almost
savage.
He was amazed ; then his eyes wan-
dered to her hair —luxuriant chestnut-
brown hair!
He had forgotten that fashions change.

VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE.
When Alfred was a few months old
he derived so much pleasure from his
rattle that his mother decided he was
going to be a famous musician.
His father, however, had other plans.
Alfred, he decided, should be a member
of Parliament. As the child grew
older the rest of the family began
to show interest in his future career.
His grandmother on his mother’s side
could tell by his hands that he would
make a marvellous surgeon, but his
father’s sister considered that his keen
perception and ready repartee would be
wasted in any profession but the Law.
As a boy, Alfred, not content with one
vocation, imagined himself in turn as
engine-driver, circus clown, aviator,
policeman, explorer, professional foot-
baller, sailor, bushranger, archbishop and
boundary-rider.
His mother’s sister thought he was cut
out for a business career, and suggested
that his father’s brother might give him
a start in his office.
His father’s brother, however, felt cer-
tain that the lad was best suited to be a
farmer.
“And a healthy life, too,” he added.
“Put him on the land.”
To please his relations Alfred tried his
hand at various jobs before he found his
proper a vacation. “Lucky Alf” is now
earning a large and steadily increasing
income by selling syndicate shares in the
Government lottery.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
A soft patch at the turn brought about
Multudo’s defeat by Veilantif (10 to 1)
in the Flying Handicap at Randwick,
where 22,000 people—an increase of 2000
on last year’s figures—enjoyed good rac-
ing at Tatt.’s Club May fixture. Multudo
with 9st. 131 b. was ridden a fine race by
Jim Pike, but he could not get the de-
sired break on Veilantif at the turn, and
the three-year-old beat the topweight by
half a length. Anchor was third ; Blixten
never flattered his supporters at any stage,
his display compared with his Warwick
Farm showing being poor. There was
fair support for Turbine, but he has never
shone as a sprinter. Rona Valley is worth
following at the mid-week meetings ; her
fourth was a good effort.
Oro never looked better, but is not
racing up to his looks. Hunter White’s
chestnut again let his party down in the
James Barnes Stakes. He had the run of
the race, was going easily to the half-
mile, and then dropped back beaten.
Perhaps his heart was not in it. The
winner, Journal (7 to 1), has been a good
money-spinner for Moorefield owner-
trainer Jack Cush, who also had successes
with Encre, the three-year-old’s dam.
Journal galloped kindly for young Par-
sons, who stole the race when he sent
his mount away from First Balloon at the
three-furlong pole. Journal tired, and

First Balloon, battling on gamely, got to
within a long neck of him. Lightning
March, who had had a run in the Fly-
ing Handicap, came home well to get
third prize, but Mr. Kerry dropped right
out from the top of the straight.
Duke Caledon was a warm favorite in
the early betting on the Two-Year-Old,
Then Eiver Walker’s El Cacique colt
Silver King, who had won easily at
Moorefield, was the medium of sensa-
tional support from eights to 5 to 2. The
result was not in doubt after the first two
furlongs ; Silver King cleared out, and
Bartle, keeping him going to the end,
beat the outsider Rogerio by eight lengths,
with Watson a poor third. El Cacique,
who is by Tracery, was bred in Argen-
tina ; the dam, Silver Wedding, is related
to Wedding Feast. Silver King is raced
on lease by Walker. If he stays as well
as he sprints he may have a great career.
Duke Caledon’s Derby stocks have
slumped, but the big field was not to his
advantage, and Jim Munro did not per-
severe with him when his chance looked
hopeless.
Warwick Farm trainer I. H. Andrews
has given Broccoli every chance. The
son of Rivoli —Broncurry disappointed
as a two-year-old, but has come good at
four years, and put up a sterling per-
formance in the Novice. In going for a
run on the rails near the Leger he got
on the heels of Diamond and dropped
back. Jim Munro pulled Broccoli to the
outside, and Rivoli’s son went on to win
easily from Silver Foam and Mayon-
naise. Eights was the price. Silky Oak
showed pace to the turn, and Sunstone,
after being a long way back in the early
stages, was doing good work at the finish.
Old Eton Blue sent the bookies home
rejoicing when he narrowly beat High
Degree in the Welter Mile. They quoted
him at 33 to 1 ; the 10s. tote paid £42
18s. for a win and £7 4s. 6d. for a place.
Tortoni was third. Eton Blue’s victory
astonished his trainer, Dan Lewis, as the
old grey had recently been fired on the
forelegs, and could not be galloped much.
He had been out of the winning list for
over three years. Hall Mark’s brother
Some Hero was the best-backed candi-
date. Once more he let his party down.
* * * *
Redditch, winner of the 1933 Grand
National, is still the greatest cross-
country horse in the Commonwealth.
Weighted at 13st. 21b. for the Brunswick
Steeplechase at Moonee Valley, he met
with only mild support; it was his first
essay over fences for nine months. Red:
ditch (13st. 81b.) fell in the V.R.C. August
Steeplechase, and Inkson sustained head
injuries that have kept him out of the
game ever since. The mount at the
Valley was entrusted to Hynes, who
handled Redditch splendidly. The Red
Dennis gelding looked to have victory
assured when he wrested control from
Greendon two fences from home ; but
Fulham, with a pull of just on 3st., fin-
ished too strongly for Fred Hoysted’s
champion, and scored by a length and
a half.
Honors of the contest distinctly lay
with Redditch, but there is no telling the
extent to which Fulham may develop as
a timber-topper. Though a six-year-old,
like Redditch, he is comparatively new
to steeplechasing. He is by Poitrel, like
Belar and Poidale, who captured the
Grand National Hurdle and Australian
Hurdle last year. Salisbury, who piloted
Fulham, is a comparatively unknown
jockey.
Until the week-end it seemed that
Burke, the Flemington trainer, would
seriously rival Hoysted in the strength
of his jumping team this winter ; but
misfortune befell Burke at Moonee Val-
ley. Harding (Heroic —Oboe) failed him
in the Banya Hurdle, while Drake will
have to be thrown out of commission
as the result of injury sustained in the
Brunswick Steeplechase, for which Drake
was favorite. He jumped somewhat
poorly, but took the fences safely enough
until Calfly and Gravelines fell in front
of him at the half-way stage. A hoof
of one of these horses struck Drake on
the off foreleg, inflicting a deep gash near
the shoulder. He completed the course
with blood flowing down the limb, Arms-
den, his jockey, having been ignorant of
the mischief.
Burke had accepted for Wayback and
Harding in the Banya Hurdle, but with-
drew the former, whom he considered
to have no chance of conceding Sarokos
a stone in weight. When Sarokos dwelt
at the post and gave the field fully 20
lengths’ start before springing into action,
it looked a guinea to a gooseberry against
the grey gaining even a place and equally
certain that the race was a gift for Hard-
ing. At the back of the course Harding
had a lead of six lengths from his nearest
rival. Before five furlongs had been
covered Sarokos overtook Burke’s candi-
date and immediately assumed control.
Harding tried to regain the lead, but
ruined his chance by poor jumping and
knocked up. Though rated as a non-
stayer Sarokos showed no inclination
to tire, and, in fact, was eased up over
the home stretch to score by 34 lengths
from Raiwena, who cut Harding out of
second honors. Sarokos was bred by
G. J. Docker, his owner, and is by Sar-
chedon from Manatunga, by George
Frederick (son of Carbine) from Huka,
by Devon, the horse that finished second
in the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups of
1894.
Phenomenon, the Brazen five-vear-old
that W. I. Smart brought from Queens-
land, is amply paying his way on Mel-
bourne courses. On May she won the
Ascot Five Hundred, and he scored over
seven furlongs at the Valley in a manner
that suggests more than mere sprinting
ability. Divisions of the Two- and
Three-year-old Handicap were annexed
by Jacasse and Blue Shot respectively.
The former was sired by Windbag and
Blue Shot by Ronsard. In the finai event,
the Keera Welter, Lord Whittier gave
bookmakers a “skinner.” He started at
the nominal odds of 50 to 1, and paid
£24 9s. for ss. in the tote win pool. Up
to that stage McShortodds had been
moaning dreadfully.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Australian middleweight champion
Fred Henneberry is out of favor with the
Sydney Stadium management, and has
to travel to get matches. In the same
week he defeated Westralian Jack
O’Brien at Brisbane and Alby Roberts at
Parramatta. He was too heavy for the
abo., whom he knocked down for “six”
in the seventh.
* * * *
Haban Singh (still said to weigh 2001 b.)
again showed wrestling superiority over
Joe Gotch (who looked much heavier
than his announced 2161 b.) at Leichhardt.
He threw the much-heavier American
about as if he were a bag of bran, and
scored a pinfall in the fifth, but was him-
self pinned in the sixth. Another draw.
Walter Browning and George Penchiff
each downed the other in their match at
Newtown. Here Browning was declared
the winner on points.
Woodfull’s Men
The Australians got the first jolt of
their tour against a strong M.C.C. side
at Lord’s, skippered by Chapman—who
scratched up a rather gingerly 31 n.o. —
and including only one professional—
Hendren. The Englishmen scored 341
on Saturday for seven wickets, but read-
ing between the lines of the cables this
seems to have been due, not only to some
excellent batting by Hendren (135), Wyatt
(72) and Valentine (40), but to indifferent
bowling by every trundler save Wall,
who worked like a Trojan to take 4 for
64. Grimmett, with an injured hand,
had an off day, while Fleetwood-Smith
again showed what a match-winner he
isn’t. McCabe and O’Reilly also failed
badly with the ball. Worse than all it
is to read that the fielding was, save for
Bradman, Ponsford, Brown and Darling,
of third-rate quality, especially in the
slips, the positions where Australia failed
in match after match against Jardine’s
side in Australia. O’Reilly and Fleet-
wood-Smith each missed a sitter off Wall,
and two chances were also dropped off
Grimmett.

Footbrawl
In Melbourne on Saturday Carlton
Ova'l held 40,000, who roared themselves
hoarse as first the home side and then
South Melbourne forged ahead. For
an early-season game play was unusually
fast and open, with the locals a trifle
smarter in the pick-up and use of the
long, driving kick. What advantage they
gained was in the second quarter, when
their half-forwards and forwards ran
rings round the Southern backs. There-
after South fought back hard, pinning
the Blues down to a 5-point score in the
last quarter, and would have won but
for a couple of ill-judged kicks just on
bell-ring. As it was, it finished only
3 points in arrear —119 to Carlton’s 122.
For the winners Shea, Davey, Crowe and
Diggins (he broke an ankle towards the
close) shone out; for South, Pratt (10
goals), Thomas and goalkeeper Hillis.
At St. Kilda 25,000 onlookers grew
tired of the too-few turnstiles, pushed the
pickets down and scrambled in—to the
detriment of the gate. Saints proved so
strong and skilful that Richmond’s Tigers
had to show all they knew to dodge de-
feat, winning ultimately by only 4 points
—B7 to 83. At North Melbourne Gee-
long also had a narrow escape, due
largely to bad kicking. The Pivot
scraped home with 77 to North’s 70. At
Footscray the locals accounted for Fitz-
roy 96 to 72. Collingwood met Essendon
at Victoria Park and scored 114 to 86.
Melbourne was at home to Hawthorn
and treated the Mayblooms discour-
teously by piling on 133 points to 44.
* * * *
Rugby Union in Sydney provided an
outstanding match on Saturday when
Randwick obliterated Manly on the
latter’s ground by 33-11 —7 tries, 6 con-
verted by Larnach-Jones, to 2 tries and
converting and penalty goals by Ross.
Manly got a 50-50 share of the ball from
the scrums, but in the line-outs, the
loose and the ruck the Randwick for-
wards played with the opposition and
gave their backs countless openings which
the latter rarely failed to use to advan-
tage. Manly backs suffered even worse
by comparison with the opposition rear-
guard. From full-back Bedford to the
scrum-half, Richards, the Greens were
masters throughout. Towers and Herd
at centre made the opposition look like
second-graders, while Richards, playing
his first big game for some time, beat
Waratah-Wallaby Malcolm pointless.
Five-eighth Nejaim was an able con-
necting link with the three-quarter line.
Ross was solid, but Manly centres let
their wingers starve, Kellaher being idle
all day. Pashley’s hooking saved a higher
score against his side. Tempers were
strained as the first half closed, and fists
were flying. After the referee had sent
Beer, of Manly, to the pavilion, com-
parative peace reigned for the rest of the
game.
Other results: Drummoyne 17, W.
Suburbs 16 ; Northern Suburbs 25, East-
ern 13 ; University 33, Parramatta 16.
* * * *
The Rugby League also staged a good
show at Sydney Sports Ground when
Western Suburbs won from the premiers,
Newtown, by 15-12. Newtown relied
chiefly, as in the past, on its solid pack
of scrummagers, but though the West-
erns lost a man in the second spell
they quite held their own with the Blue
vanguard. Western fielded a great back
division, including Kangaroos Ridley,
Mead and Hey. Caiman, at the scrum,
was about the best of the Blue backs, but
he had a pair of formidable opponents.
The Blue forwards were well led by Bull
and Thornton, who broke fast and wor-
ried the Western backs a lot. Scoring was
close right up to the finish, a late p.g.
putting the winners out of danger. West-
ern scored 3 tries to 2 by Newtown. Each
side kicked 3 goals.
In the other matches Eastern Suburbs
downed Balmain 24-15 on the latter’s
ground at Birchgrove, scoring 4 tries and
6 goals to 3 tries and 3 goals. South
Sydney put University to bed by 45-3,
or 11 tries and 6 goals to a try. North
Sydney astonished the heads by downing
St. George 28-7—6 tries and 5 goals to
a try and 2 goals.

end for the thirteenth consecutive time
and by 9 matches to 2, one being halved.

Woodfull’s Men
Leicestershire pluckily, if luckily,
held the Australians to a draw in their
match. The county’s first effort of 152
was answered by Australia with 368 for
five wickets, Bradman closing. McCabe
(108 n. 0.), Kippax (89), Bradman (65),
Darling (35) and ’keeper‘Barnett (30 n. 0.)
did the run-getting. The home bowling
was undistinguished, apart from Geary’s
c.b. dismissal of Bradman. Leicester
made a better showing in its second
try. Dawson, the old Cambridge cap-
tain who was here with A. H. Gilligan in
1929-30, played a fine shot for 91. L. G.
Berry, with 48, helped to make a good
stand, while the left-hand bowler of
other days, Astill, astonished all and
sundry with a score of 50 n. 0., Geary
aiding an eighth-wicket partnership with
27. The Australian bowling, with the
wet ball, was not impressive, though
O’Reilly added four wickets to his first-
innings tally. Fleetwood-Smith also got
four batsmen out for 83 runs. Constant
showers held up the game, which, in addi-
tion, was drawn an hour before time to
let the tourists catch an early train for
their next match. If any were needed,
here is an instance of the farcical condi-
tions governing matches between the
Australians and the weaker counties.
* * * *
Ponsford has a weakness for English
Uni. bowling—he made 220 n.o. against
Oxford in 1930 —and in the third match
of this tour the nuggety Victorian knocked
back the Cambridge bowling and those
Australian experts who said he was a
spent force with 229 n. 0., made in a
fashion which earned approval from
such judges as Fry and Jackson. Brown
also played a taking shot for 105, and
Darling was sparkling for 98. Bradman
got a duck, clean-bowled by J. G. Davies,
a slow right-hander with a leg break.
Woodfull closed at 5 for 481. Grim-
mett sent Cambridge packing in its
first knock for 158, the Adelaidean tak-
ing 9 for 34. Jehangir Khan hit lustily
for 33. In the second try six Light Blues
were out for 68. Some plucky lash by
the tail-enders saw the score reach 160.
Wall, Ebeling and Darling (2 each) and
Fleetwood-Smith (3) took the wickets.
Australia won by an innings and 163.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: Thus early in the tour,
the duds of the Australian Eleven are
beginning to make themselves manifest.
Looking back on this trip, followers of
the game will wonder in days to come
how selection for the team depended so
much on the patronage of publicity
hounds. These experts of other days are
a curse to the game. One ugly feature
of their ascendancy is that they lose no
opportunity of concealing the failures of
their pets and “knocking” players they
don’t like or who have been selected
against their advice.
* * * *
“Yah!”: Sydney flapperdom wept all
. . ~ f
the paint off its collective face last week
when the dreadful news came over the
cables that Bradman had made a duck
against Cambridge. It certainly has not
been a habit of Don’s, but he has done
it before now and will do it many times
again before the final drawing of stumps.
It may be worth noting, though, that in
his four previous dismissals for a cipher
a black man was responsible for two.
Queensland abo. Gilbert got him in Bris-
bane in 1931. The same year Griffith,
of the West Indies, sent him back score-
less to the pavilion at the S.C.G. If
Bradman ever goes to fortune-tellers he
will do well to pay attention when the
sibyl tells him to beware of a dark man.
* * * *
“Thomas”: Some of these chunks of
cabled propaganda from the cricket front
make one ponder. There Las
been a string of follow-up s
mg that the mail received b Y Bradman
contains many anonymous a
tett ers calculated to make a c f ‘
Most of these are said to
Nottingham and contain hints that he
will need a personal bodyguard when he
gets among the lacemakeis. n
hand > manager Bush by, who s in con-
stant touch with Bradman, says he has
never heard of any such letters, either
from Bradman or anyone else,

Ibn el Is sar : Interesting to me, at
least, to see that Jehangir Khan, who
played for India during the tour of Eng-
]ancj j n 1932, bowled for Cambridge
aga j nst t h e Australians. Jehangir is a
Mosl as his name shouts to the house-
’ .. _ . ....
tops. Ranji, puleepsinhji and Pataudi
were, or are, all Hindus. One would have
thought that the Moslem, with no caste
observance and only such minor matters
as pork and wine included in his list of
prohibitions, would have come more to
the front in an essentially mixing game
like cricket than high-caste Hindus like
the trio mentioned, all Rajputs into the
bargain,

“Richmond”: The opening of the Vic-
torian League football season in Mel-
bourne was marked by several records.
Firstly, the total of points scored, 1204,
was the highest yet for an opening day.
Essendon’s scrap with Footscray pro-
duced 239 points for the match —21
higher than the previous best. Also Col-
lingwood lost its first opening-day match
for nine years, when the premiers, South
Melbourne, won 127-92. Better than all
that was a record opening attendance and
gate—l2B,ooo and £3lOO.
* * *
“Fitzcray”: One of the Victorian
League football clubs —it was “The Same
Old” —hit on a bright idea for opening
its football season, and the treasurer has
been shedding tears of contrition ever
since. It prepared a nice new ball, and,
having decorated it with the club colors,
arranged for an aeroplane to drop it on
the field just before the match with Foot-
scray began. The airman made a bad
shot and landed the oval in among the
crowd. Officials made a frantic dash to
recover it, but in vain. Like the Mac-
Gregors in the ballad, it “had vanished
for ever.”
* * * *
“Hotham”: Melbourne “Argus” pub-
lishes a homily on the growing practice
of “intimidation” in football. The writer
points out that older players make a point
of trying to knock the stuffing out of a
new recruit to an opposing club, with a
view to putting him off his game. He
doesn’t suggest a remedy, merely remark-
ing that, “As a means of defeating an
opponent, intimidation is rather crude.”
This, quite a proper view to take of the
matter, is not much consolation to some
neophyte who has stopped a swing to the
jaw or a boot to the breadbasket.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: The N.S.W.R.U. heads
made a bad miss recently when they
could find no better second engagement
for the Victorians early next month than
one against a Sydney club. Naturally,
Victoria, which all but beat N.S.W. in
their first meeting in Sydney last year
and won handsomely in the second, is
indignant at the slur. Ma has climbed
down, and the second game, on June 4,
will be against a Metropolitan fifteen.
Racquet and Bawl
Crawford rattled his admirers last
week with another of those curious re-
versals of form so characteristic of him.
In a match with Holland at Amsterdam
he was beaten two sets to one by the
Dutch champion Timmer, a second-
rater at his best. A cabled excuse is that
Crawford thought the match was to be
one of five sets, whereas it had been
changed to one of three.
* * * *
“Jeu de Palme”: The Australian team
has been rearranged for the French
championships. Crawford will have Mc-
Grath as a doubles partner, Quist and
Turnbull teaming up. Last year Mc-
Grath and Quist were together and
reached the finals. Crawford will play
with Miss Scriven in the mixed doubles,
and the pair ought to keep their title.
Turnbull will have Mrs. Molesworth for
partner.
* * * *
“Top Spin”: The first round of the
Davis Cup, which must be over by May
20, sees Switzerland and India meet in
the top half of the draw and France
and Austria in the bottom, all the others
having byes. The second round, in which
Australia meets Japan, must be over by
lune 12, and this match has been set
down for Eastbourne during the week
ending on that date. June 21 will see
the semi-finals and July 16 the final of
the European zone. The inter-zone final
opens on July 21, and the challenge
round at Wimbledon on July 28.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: The potentates of
Wimbledon have been outraged to hear
that the big London bookmakers —they
like to call ’em “Turf Commissioners”
over there —are opening books on the re-
sult of the All-England championships.
At present Perry is favorite, with Austin
and Crawford bracketed second. A long
way down come Borotra and Stoeffen in
third place. Rules are: All-in, play or
not; one-half the odds against reaching
the final and a sixth against getting to the
semi-finals. It is a new departure for
the bagmen—that is, as a regular thing
—but for years Stock Exchange betting
on these events has been as heavy as that
on Test-cricket results. For instance,
Cochet went out at 10 to 1 on when he
won in 1930.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Bertha Biffit”: A fine gesture in the
cause of women’s rights was seen in
Sydney last week when Odette Lefebvre,
the charming young Frenchwoman who
won the N.S.W. women’s title in 1931
and last year, struck a blow for the free-
dom of her sex somewhat in the manner
of Charlotte Corday. She was down to
play in an inter-club match when the
ladies in control of women’s golf in this
State issued a communique forbidding
any associate to appear without stock-
ings. Miss Odette dropped out of her
team. There are fears that she may main-
tain her attitude when more important
•events come along, taking for her slogan
“No socks, or more shocks.”
* * * *
“Cupar”: According to the cables, the
American Walker Cup team on its way
to play Britain at St. Andrews adopted
what 1 can only as a Scotsman call in-
(After the twelfth putt): “What an idiotic place to put a hole!”
timidatory methods calculated to estab-
lish an inferiority complex in the minds
of their opponents, 60 per cent, of whom
are Scotsmen. Practising during the
voyage, they drove 1500 balls into the
seas. Counting the cost of each ball at
2s. only —a most conservative estimate
—that means a careless waste of a hunner
an’ fifty punds English. Ma conscience!
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: One of the greatest
shocks Scotland has suffered since Flodden
came along last week when a horde of
bookmakers and their clerks went round
with the crowd during the Walker Cup
match at historic St. Andrews calling
the odds at every hole and laying on the
running in between. The links of the
Royal and Antient are municipal pro-
perty, so the club, unless it has munici-
pal backing, is helpless to prevent any-
thing of the kind. Writer knows some
municipalities which would cheerfully
accept a cut of the bookies’ profits for
giving them an open go. He is not sug-
gesting for a moment that the un-
paralleled happening recorded above was
due to any regrettable practices of the
kind. Only Scottish bookmakers were
operating. The best price against Britain,
which hasn’t won since the match was
begun 22 years ago, was 6 to 4.

Sydney golfers, and those of Manly in
particular, will hear with regret of the
death of R. J. D. Sellar, for many years
a member of the Village club, though of
late he had been unable to play much
serious golf. He was particularly notable
for his interest in the Manly caddies.
Every year the dividend he drew from a
club debenture went to a fund for the
entertainment of the lads. Joe Kirk-
wood had much to thank Sellar for in
his early golfing days, and always appre-
ciated the help and counsel given.
* * * *
“Hamilton”: A lot of southern golfers
are expected in Brisbane for the State
championships, which run from May 23
to June 2 on Royal Queensland’s course.
The open is, of course, the star event
(the present holder is amateur J. N.
Radcliffe) ; this is 72 holes stroke, and
the first eight amateurs to finish qualify
for the amateur match-play champion-
ship. Ivo Whitton won that honor last
year, but whether he will trek up from
Victoria, again to defend it remains to
be seen. One player the Banarialanders
hope to see is Jim Ferrier, who has yet
to give them a ; glimpse of his form.
Car and Cycle
“Pram”: The irrepressible British
small-car continues to put up surprising
performances. At Brooklands the other
day R. T. Horton, in a M. G. Magnette
(1087 c.c.), ran 117 miles in 60min.,
beating Eyston’s previous record of 115 m.
981yds. The best 60 minutes’ run for
a big 500-h.p. machine is 139.7 m.p.h.
Horton’s machine was the same type as
that used by W. B. Thompson in the
Australian Grand Prix in March, when
he averaged 77.6 m.p.h. for 203 miles on
Phillip Island.
* * * *
“Methuselah”: When the N.S.W. Light
Car people recently arranged a run for
ancient cars of a vintage not later than
30 years or so back, there was a great
rummaging in scrapheaps and searching
of abandoned fowlhouses. A surprising
number of what had been cars has been
dragged into daylight, but, since most of
these were decrepit and necessary spare
parts had to be fabricated by hand, the
day for the great event was put forward
to May 26. Many of the derelicts are
now unregistered, and arrangements are
being made for the issue of temporary
permits and number-plates. The journey
will be from Sydney to Bondi, and small
boys of the Eastern Suburbs anticipate
a profitable day from assisting the chaul-
feurs as “shovers” up the numerous hills
on the route.
* * * *
“White City”: There seem to be some
grounds for the desire of the British dirt-
track motor-cyclists (B. 2/5/’34) that too
many Australian riders should come
to Britain this season. London “Star,
commenting gloomily on the fact that
there are already 22 Australians in Eng-
land, all of the highest quality, forecasts
that Australia will this year waltz off
with the speedway championship, at
present held by Britain. For the rest, the
game is said to be going better than ever,
in spite of competition from the dogs.

“Fitzcray”: A quaint cycling row is
raging in Melbourne. Waterford put up
new road records in a ride from Mel-
bourne to Adelaide and back, the double
journey taking him 112 hr. 37min. lor
the 1173 miles. Approaching Melbourne,
Victorian Ossie Nicholson joined up with
Waterford, and rode 400 miles of the
return journey alongside him. Water-
ford complained that Nicholson’s action
worried him, and the referee promptly
disqualified the unbidden guest lor three
moons. Nicholson swears that no one
objected to - his presence or asked him
to clear out, and has prepared a sheaf
of affidavits in his defence.
Miscellaneous
“Huon”: It looks as if the Derwent
course will in future be barred for King’s
Cup races. Two gatherings there—this
year’s and that of 1927 —have seen
crews swamped. This season N. S.
Wales objected to the Derwent, but,
as the other States did not fall in line,
it was decided to hold the race there.
There is a fine sheltered course on the
Tamar at Launceston which was used
in 1921. This is likely to be the venue
when Tassie’s turn comes round again.

“Psst”: The prediction (B. 18/4/’34)
that the Empiad committee would get a
headache before the question of a
chaperon for the two girl swimmers
selected for the Games was settled has
been fulfilled. The N. S. Wales
ladies said they would raise the
necessary £l5O for expenses —or they
were reported as having said so —and
then the committee chose a chaperon—
from Victoria. It followed that up by
sending a chit to the Ma State girls ask-
ing when the cheque would be ready as
promised. This was met with a chorus
of “Oh, you story ; we never did! ” The
committee countered with the statement
that since the Ma Staters had given a
guarantee to get in the brass it should be
honored. The N.S.W. dames have come
back with the assertion that all they
ever promised to do was to help in pass-
ing the hat —so there now.
* * * *
“Spike”: Two more men were added
to the Australian Empiad team last week
after a postal vote of the States had been
taken. They are Noel Dempsey, of
Queensland, and J. Knight, of N.S.W.
Knight is the Australian and N.S.W.
heavy wrestling champion. Dempsey won
the Australian 100-yards title at Adelaide
in January, being clocked at 9 4-ssec.,
and leaving Ted Hampson and Yates
behind him. Yates beat him by a split
second in the 220, and was the selector’s
first choice for the sprints.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
THE STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MEGGITTS LINSEED MEAL
WOOLPACK WASTE.
“Sheepo” : The average weight of bales
throughout the 1933-34 season has been
less than 3101 b., and with handling
charges on a per-bale basis, irrespective
of weight, the industry has been throw-
ing money away. Growers gain nothing
by lightly pressing their wool. With
average weights in "the vicinity of 3401 b.,
there would be £200,000 more for the'
industry through the saving of pack
purchases.
The idea that seems to prevail is that
a buyer, seeing a heavy bale, will
deduce at once that the wool is of low
yield. Even were such a fallacy correct,
it is just as certain that no buyer would
be intrigued into thinking that an extra-
light bale was necessarily of a high yield.
There are some clips where the wool
is extremely light and bulky, and where
it is almost impossible to get anywhere
near average weight of fleece into the
bales. There’s no reason for bales con-
taining the lower sorts in these clips to
be also pressed lightly.
MORE ON WOOL TYPES.
“Dead Finish”: For many years _we
have been told from the other side of the
world that our wool clip has been too
coarse, and exhorted to grow finer wools.
Generally, our wools have been broad-
ened, in consequence of producing a
heavier and lengthier clip, but with no
detriment to the quality. (This does not
apply to the lots.)
The woolgrower proper has been
forced, through slump prices, to produce
more, and the only way open on a fully-
stocked holding has been to pack more
on to the sheep’s back.
That this has been accomplished, the
increased average fleece weight shows.
It has been effected by a better selection,
when purchasing rams for flock use, than
was deemed necessary when wool was
booming. The rambreeder has done his
part, also, in turning out as good a type
of commercial sale ram as we have ever
had in the history of the industry. Nowa-
days, as a general “soft,” our wool is a
deep-grown medium, of robust charac-
ter, and shows good quality and length.
That this is the best commercial proposi-
tion for us, most growers will agree, and
the viewpoint is further borne out by
remarks taken from a report just to
hand from Jacomb Hoare and Cos., wool-
brokers of London. They say: “In these
days quality does not seem to play the
part it used to in the determination of
the value of fleece wool; length obviously
is given more prominence.” And again,
in another report on Australian wools:
“These met an active general demand,
especially those where length and robust-
ness were notable features.”
A SIMPLE CLASSING SCHEME.
“Merino”: The classer of a clip should
bear in mind that the buyer wants not
only a distinction between qualities but
between lengths.
For a merino clip I have always found
the following manner of classing the
best:
In setting out your lines of 60’s, 64’s,
70’s qualities, remember to make a warp
and a half-warp line of each individual
quality, putting all wool with a staple
length from 14 to 2} inches in the half-
warp bins, and the longer wool in warp
bins.
Your next line is the weft wool (under
H inches in length and used in the cloth-
ing trade). In my experience it is more
profitable to put it with the tender wool,
which is also used in the clothing trade.
Now you have only two more lines
to make —the heavy-conditioned and
doggy wool.
All told, there are nine lines, which
are not too many for a clip having 20,000
sheep or more.
BLOWFLIES, BIRDS AND TREES.
“Lucerne Flea”: I have'come to the
conclusion that the blowfly is ten times
worse in a treeless area than in one
where there are clumps of timber.
Booborowie (S.A.), where there are few
trees, is one of the worst spots for
fly trouble in Australia. I have seen
stud flockmasters there run over their
sheep twice a day —and still lose scores.
A few miles away, the country is dotted
with gums, in whose hollow limbs insect-
eating birds nest and roost; the fly
is never bad there. Our best friends in
the war against the fly are the birds —
first, those like the magpie, which pick
up the maggot, and, next, those of the
swallow tribe, which catch the fly on the
wing. I have seen nearly 40 blowflies
taken from a wood-martin.
You don’t find insect-eating birds
far from timber. Only the other day
I talked with a traveller who called the
farmers of my district unprogressive, and
pointed to the fine old gums which
dotted the paddocks as proof. “Where
I come from we clear our land thor-
oughly,” he said. Unfortunately for his
argument, we happened to be close to
a tree-dotted paddock some five miles
out of Bordertown (S.A.), which grew the
champion wheat crop of the whole State
a few seasons before —and in this dis-
trict the sheepfly is a minor problem. It
was a major one where the traveller
came from.
LAYING OUT THE DAIRY.
“Bar K.”: Here are a few points worth
noting :
The separator-room should not abut
the milking-shed. There should be at
least six feet of circulating air between
the two buildings.
Place the cream-store so that it is well
shaded in the hot weather and avoids the
cowyard dust.
Drainage from the cowyard must not
flow too close to the separator-room, as
it may taint the cream in hot or exces-
sively damp weather.
Every dairy should have a copper or
boiler and fireplace adjacent to it.
Provide for free ventilation in all
buildings, and, if possible, have fly-proof
gauze on doors and windows in the
cream-room.
“Cleanliness” must be the watchword
in the layout, and sweeter milk and
cream will result.
BUTTER-FAT AND BREEDING.
“C.P.”: Evidently “W.D.McC.” (B.
2/5/’34) has misunderstood “Bahb
Dwyer” when he said that butter-fat per-
centage was derived from breeding. It is
a fact that breed (not breeding) is the
chief factor in this matter. For instance,
a Friesian or Ayrshire will not give the
butter-fat test that a Jersey or Guernsey
will —however fed or bred. The fat con-
tent may range from 2.5 or less for the
former to 8 or over for the latter. But
as the Friesian and Ayrshire give more
milk, there may not be so much differ-
ence in the total butter-fat per cow.
Breeding not being an exact science,
“W.D.McC.” may have seen pure-bred
animals that would keep a cow cocky
poor all his life, but that also applies in
a very much greater degree to the herds
of mongrels that I see daily.
If you have a pure-bred that does not
do her job, get rid of her. That is what
herd-testing is for. Breed from a cow
whose test you know, and all the better
if you know her dam’s and g.-dam’s test.
Feeding, if a cow receives sufficient
nutrients to maintain her body weight,
does not affect to any material extent
butter-fat percentage, but it does affect
the milk production.
Most dairymen have an ideq that any
sort of feed is good enough for a cow
to do her best on. This, of course, is
plain stupidity. A cow cannot produce
up to her maximum capacity and for any
length of time unless she has feed which
gives her the materials to do so. The
maize mentioned by “W.D.McC.” does
not, amongst other things, contain nearly
enough protein. The millet is better in
this respect, but still falls short.
PRODUCTION OF CHILLERS.
“Cass”: It’s to young cattle that N.S.W.
must look in the production of a chiller.
A young, prime beast. The day of the
slow-maturing, heavier breeds is past, as
is the waiting five years for steers to
stop growing and put on flesh on our
natural pastures. Chillers are required to
be prime at about 2| years old, and at
that age weigh about 11001 b. live weight
and about 6801 b. dressed. To produce
an animal that will mature as quickly as
this on natural pastures, it is useless to
consider dual-purpose breeds —cattlemen
must plump for the purely beef breeds:
the Shorthorn-Hereford or Aberdeen
Angus.
I find on my natural pastures (Central
Tablelands, N.S.W.) the best results come
from the Angus-Shorthorn or Hereford
cross. The Angus is a specialised beast
with small bones and rounded barrel,
with the weight of flesh where most re-
quired by the butcher, whose final judg-
ment decides price and fitness.
The actual weight of a beast is not the
be-all and end-all with butchers. They
require the maximum weight in sirloins,
topside and silverside rounds, and prime
ribs, nicely marbled with fat (heavy,
lumpy fat is liable to turn rancid in
chilling), and the minimum weight in
blades, necks, briskets and bone. It is in
these requirements that the Aberdeen
Angus excels; also they stamp their
qualities upon their get.
LARGE WHITES.
“lan Joinerson”: I welcome “Kirby’s”
suggestion (B. 17/4/’34) for a discussion
of pig breeds —we have far too many—
but adhere to my idea that the L.W. is
the only sire worth while for the export
trade, and the best for any purpose
except lard production.
“Kirby” is, unfortunately, nearly right
when he says we have no export trade,
but until there is our pig industry has
no future. The Australian is one of the
smallest eaters of pig products among
white races, probably because there are
too many curers of the type mentioned
by “Kirby,” who insist on supplying
lard instead of bacon.
The English preference for the L.W.
is based not on size but on quality and
shape. The well-bred L.W. shows more
lean meat in proportion to fat, longer
and better-shaped sides, heavier and
better-shaped hams in proportion to neck
and shoulders than other breeds, and a
total absence of seedy cut, which is found
in all colored pigs.
In addition, it is not surpassed by any
other breed in gain per pound of feed
supplied, and, as many Victorian and
Riverina growers have proved after years,
of experience, is not subject to sun-scald,
if given a reasonably balanced ration and
good-living conditions.
As for “Kirby’s” contention that L.Ws.
cannot be turned off as light bacon or
pork for the local market, all 1 can say
is that hundreds of us do turn them
off as such, and get quite as good prices,
often at an earlier age, as our neighbors
do for other breeds.
As an offset to “Kirby’s” factory that
finds them not fat enough, I may men-
tion that one Victorian buyer, who tells
me his average purchases are 700 a week,
has been offering prizes to encourage the
use of pure-bred L.W. boars.
That Australia can develop an export
trade is proved by a recent Riverina trial
shipment, which was said by Smithfield
experts to be ideal for that market, both
in type and quality. The whole shipment
was by L.W. sires, and no country ever
has made a success on the English market
which did not use the breed, though
many have tried.
“Kaniva”: The writer’s firm in W.A.
has been marketing baconers by a Large
White boar from sows of Tamworth-
Berkshire and Gloucester-Berkshire cross
of weights 1101b. to 1301b. for nearly two
years. Our pigs have consistently topped
the market at Katanning, and, since send-
ing to Midland Junction during the last
12 months, have given equally good
results. I have a letter from the
auctioneers in Perth commenting on the
excellent quality of a consignment of 34
of our baconers and the competition they
received.
One firm informed us that the only
complaint it had was that it could
not get enough of them. Previous to
using the Large White we were breeding
by a Tamworth Boar from Berkshire and
Berkshire-cross sows. While we had just
as good results in the market, the Tam-
worth cross took a little longer to reach
equal weights witn Large Whites, but a
point in favor of the Large White boar
was his exceptionally even litters. Pigs
over 1301b. do not show sufficient margin
in price to warrant the extra feeding.
Having procured some young pure-bred
Large White sows, we intend giving them
a trial for breeding light- and medium-
weight baconers.
SUPER. AND IRONSTONE.
“6.Q.J.”: A few years ago, when con-
ducting manurial trials on my farm, I
was surprised to find that superphosphate
was giving no results at all in several
trials, while b. and b. and bonedust were
considerably increasing the yields over
the unmanured check plots. In the next
trial, the Department of Agriculture
advised testing basic super, (super, and
air-slaked lime mixed).against plain super.
The basic super, gave excellent results,
and the explanation is that there was
ironstone present in the soil.
Chemical action set up by the ironstone
and super, will, under certain weather
conditions, prevent the action of the super,
on the soil or plant life, although it may
benefit later crops. I have since had
trials on the same land in which super,
responded at once. This may have been
helped by the fact that the land had been
limed from time to time, but it is more
likely that it was governed by suitable
weather conditions, under which the
super, readily dissolved.
Basic super, will get a quick response
regardless of ironstone. This will explain
the unpopularity of super, in country
such as the County of Cumberland
(N.S.W.), where ironstone deposits are
fairly frequent, and b. and b. and bone-
dust are in demand.

HINTS FOR THE FARM
“Yamagi”: Old car transmission shafts
make good crowbars. The steel in them
is the very best. Just heat them in the
forge and belt them to the required
shape. They’re good at practically any
temper.
“Egad”: “Tipster’s” remarks re the
joining-up of maiden ewes (B. 25/4/’34)
are to the point, but he has omitted the
main factor. Never put young rams with
maiden ewes. Old ewes and young rams
is a good policy.
“Myloonga”: Where sandflies infest
the bails and horse-yards, the following
mixture should oust the pests. To four
gallons of water —a kerosene-can —add
six ounces of strong commercial am-
monia, half a pint of kerosene and about
a pound of lime. Stir briskly until the
mixture is emulsified, and then spray the
ground, and the animals, if necessary,
with an ordinary insect atomiser. This
solution will saturate the ground and
prevent the flies from breeding.
“Two Jays”: When the cockatoos
come to inspect your corn try putting a
few rabbit-traps in the outside rows. To
tie a trap on (6in. of fine wire will do)
bend over a tall, strong stalk so that
when the trap is set it rests about 3in.
to 4in. below the top of the cob. Expose
the top of the cob as a decoy. Visit the
corn patch in the morning about eight
and at sundown to pull Cocky out and
set up the trap again. This season we
lost only 1 p.c. of our corn.
“Braith”: An easy way to measure
distance. Tie a piece of rag or rope
around the tyre of a sulky ; then measure
the circumference of the wheel. By driv-
ing at a steady canter the number of
revolutions is easily counted. Multiply
the number by the circumference of the
wheel, and the sum is done.
“The Lad”: When inspecting your
crops or grasses watch for the following
signs which indicate deficiency of potash
in the soil: (1) A yellow tinge in young
cereal leaves. (2) Leaf edges are dis-
colored. (3) Irregular development or
general weakness of the crop. (4) Prema-
ture decay of root or leguminous crop
leaves.
“Bendee”: When bees are properly
distributed.through an orchard the crop
of fruit is sometimes nearly doubled.
During blossoming the colonies should
be placed throughout the orchard at
the rate of one colony per 100 trees, so
that the bees will not have to travel far
in wet weather. Pollination by bees will
cause a firmer set, a greater number of
setting fruit and fewer windfalls.
“6.Q.J.”: Don’t leave your bags lying
round the floor of the shed where the
rats can get at them, and where they may
get wet. Put a strong rail up in your
shed, about sft. from the ground
and npt less than 2ft. 6in. from the wall,
and hang the bags on it. By keeping the
rail well up, you can still use the floor
space underneath. Bags will keep much
cleaner when hung up in this way.
“Fossicker”: For a horse that is a
kicker in single harness —sulky or spring-
cart —this is much better than a loin-
strap : Plait a strong piece of clothes-line
into his tail securely—long enough to tie
to the axle of the cart so that he is able
to pull on his traces, and yet tight enough
to stop him raising his hind part to kick
without pulling on his tail. When you
let him go leave the rope on his tail
tucked round so that he can’t get caught
in it. After a couple of weeks you can
take it off, and if he is not cured then he
is a really bad one.
“L.R.W.”: To make a moderately
cheap soakage drain dig a trench to size
required, cover its floor with three inches
of crushed metal or small stones, and then
cement over. When the cement is hard
a flat-topped cement wall is made on each
side. When walls are hard, wooden slabs
are placed across the drain and rested on
each wall. Cover the slabs with straw or
shrubs and fill in.
“A.G.T.”: Castle nuts can be quickly
made from ordinary hexagon nuts.
Clamp the nut in a vyce, and make two
saw cuts side by side across the face of
the nut to the depth required, then break
out the pieces between.
“Bill R.”: Often a smooth-worn wedge
in a tough log when hit with the maul
jumps back and endangers the wood-
splitter. Sprinkle into the cleft a trickle
of sand or dry earth and the wedge will
then hold safely.
“Yamagi”: Try planting a patch of
bamboos for summer feed for stock. Any
place handy for the waste water will do.
Let them grow a year to get established.
Then at the beginning of summer cut
them level with the ground. For the
rest of the summer you can cut and
come again at the quick-growing shoots.
“A.G.T.”: Cut out rivets under the
head with a cold-set and a small sledge-
hammer. This narrows the neck of the
rivets and they are punched out quite
easily. As the heads leave don’t.stand in
the line of fire.
“Farr”: Skim milk is a perfect fer-
tiliser. It works right off the jump
and keeps on. Top-dressed on the culti-
vation, with the assistance of stockyard
manure to maintain humus content, it
will grow amazing crops of supplement-
ary feed. Nothing will stimulate back-
ward vegetables in the kitchen garden
like skim milk. It is harmless thrown on
growing plants, but don’t sow small seeds
in fallow land top-dressed with milk until
the lapse of two or three weeks.
“Squatter”: I don’t agree with “Mata-
ranka” (B. 18/4/’34) when he states that
the Barkly Tableland is not sheep coun-
try. As pasture land, it compares very
favorably with the “open downs” of
North and Central Queensland, and has
the added advantage of a more reliable
rainfall and shallow sub-artesian water.
It is true that sheep have been tried there
before, but failure was due, not to the
class of country, but to the lack of
transport facilities.
“Pick”: The minimum butter-fat test
for profitable dairy cows is 3.8. When
at the butter or cheese factory that test
for mixed milk is obtained, the dairy-
man considers it satisfactory. Often it
is not. In the herd there are sure to be
cows whose b.-f. yield is well above the
standard, and others whose individual
test is well under. Milking the latter is
a thankless labor, and they should be
sent to the butcher. Flence, a tester is
an essential on every dairy farm. Its
regular use settles the cows to be elimi-
nated, and shows the way to a general
improvement of the dairy output per
cow. Usually a large proportion of the
cows on almost every dairy is maintained
unprofitably.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
An equitable arrangement for potato-growing
on the share system ? —1304.
The landowner finds land, seed and one-
third of the manure. The share-farmer does
all cultivation and finds two-thirds of the
manure. The cost of bags and digging is equally
borne between landowner and share-farmer,
and the proceeds equally shared.
(1) How to treat apple-seeds before planting,
and most suitable varieties ? (2) How to plant
and when ? (3) I got only a 5 p.c. germination
from French crabs and Granny Smiths. Why ?
—lOBl.
(1) and (2) The seed bed should be pre-
pared in loamy soil that, while remaining moist
during the summer, is not over-wet in winter.
A liberal amount of well-rotted cow- or
horse-manure should be mixed into the soil
some time before the seeds are planted. Best
time for planting is about the end of April.
(3) Probably because you selected seeds from
immature apples. The fruit should be
thoroughly ripe and the seeds well-formed and
plump.
I have a hayshed holding about 60 tons of
hay badly infested by mice, which came into
the shed in the sheaves. There is a galvanised-
iron fence round the shed. Is there any method
of dealing with the mice ? —1448.
There is no way of entirely ridding the stack
of large numbers of mice, apart from pulling
down and rebuilding. However, these devices
will lessen the numbers: (a) Kerosene-tins,
half-filled with water, sunk flush with the
ground at the stack corners and at intervals
along the edge of the stack, will trap large
numbers. ( b ) Place bags inside the fence to
enable the mice to climb over, and if the
fence is properly erected they cannot return, (c)
Cover the sides and top with tarpaulins and
fumigate with carbon bisulphide, and although
the generated gas may not penetrate to the
centre of the stack it would certainly destroy
a number of mice. As this gas is heavier than
air, it is essential to place the liquid on top
of the stack. To assist penetration, holes could
be made with a bar in the stack roof at regu-
lar intervals, and slanting holes in the sides.
Into these pour through a pipe about half a
cup of the carbon bisulph. The quantity to
use is from 61b. to 81b. per 1000 cubic feet
of space. Care must be taken when using the
liquid because of its extreme inflammability,
but it will not injure or poison the hay.

“Something for All”
At first glance you may take it to be a
typefounder’s catalogue, owing to the
variety and blackness of its type. But
set at a rakish angle across the cover are
the words “Timber Wealth” ; then
“Something for All! A Large Return for
a Small Investment.” As you read on
you find it is the prospectus of Afforesta-
tion (Aust.) Pty., Ltd.
Depressions may come and timber
may slump; rayon and wood-pulp
manufacturers may, in their struggle for
existence, be cutting each other’s throats ;
but this co.’s optimism remains un-
shaken. It has something to sell. Acres
of pumice-loam in Maoriland planted
with pine-trees. The booklet drips with
captivating messages, heavy with ink:
“The Natural Wealth of the World” ;
“Wealth Greater than the Richest Dia-
mond Mines.” There is a photo, of the
late Lord Burnham, smiling and affluent.
But how to attain this wealth that
would put Kimberley to “lf
your vision is limited,” opportunity will
pass you by. “Your natural courage
combined with judicious reasoning only
requires guidance, and wealth beyond
your most sanguine hopes can be slowly
building up for you in the years to come.”
Having thus aroused all your capitalistic
instincts, the booklet “leads you to the
point of our story. Is there money to be
made in growing trees for profit?”
There is. And by you. At least, the
prospectus says so. You pay £35
an acre, and are bound by 13 (don’t
be superstitious!) clauses of an agree-
ment. Afforestation (Aust.) Pty. will
“reap no benefit from the product until
each lot-holder receives £750 net.” The
cost of bringing an acre of Pinus insignis
to maturity, including land and selling
costs, has been estimated by Timberlands
Woodpulp at £l2. Afforestation Pty. asks
£35, and there is no mention of rebates.
One clause of the agreement—the thir-
teenth—disowns the prospectus as part
of the contract. The 13 terms and con-
ditions are the only ones “affecting this
contract.” They make very dry reading
after the gaudy language of the
prospectus, with its alluring estimates
(“balance profit per tree, £1 10s.;
500 trees, £750”); its eight- and nine-
year-old quotations of profits, prices
and opinions; and its “we are in-
formeds” and “we believes.” Cer-
tain “life-assurance” benefits advertised
in the prospectus are not mentioned in
the conditions of the contract, though
they are endorsed on the cover. The
title of the land passes to trustees after
each block of 1000 acres sold has been
paid for in full. Out of each £35,000
charged, only £5OOO is required to be de-
posited with trustees.
The prospectus claims that the scheme
“has its educative side as an investment.”
But why pay £35 an acre for education?
In a sense, the prospectus has also its
“educative side,” and Mr. Stevens might
read it with profit before he brings in
his new Companies Bill. Afforestation
(Aust.) Proprietary, Ltd., is registered in
Victoria, but its literature has been widely
circulated in N. S. Wales.
“Anybody Seen Bill ’Awkins?”
In 1911 a prospectus of Golden Mile
Hill End Syndicate was issued, carrying
the names of A. W. Cooper and W. A. J.
Marshall as directors. Clive A. Cooper
was secretary ; capital was £2OOO. Next
year the syndicate sold out to a co. for
200,000 fully-paid 2s. shares. The pros-
pectus of this new co. elaborated upon
the wealth won on Hill End in the
seventies, when Holtermann’s nugget was
unearthed. W. A. J. Marshall was a
director and C. A. Cooper secretary. The
co. said its main object was to explore
the property at depth. The fabulously
rich ore of the ’seventies gave out at
400 ft.
This was not the first Hill End co.
that C. A. Cooper was interested in.
Hawkins Hill Reward, formed in 1909,
had C. A. Cooper as its manager. About
this time Rowley’s Reef Co. and Amal-
gamated Hill End were also searching
for the elusive El Dorado supposed to
exist below the 400 ft. level.
In 1922 an interim injunction was
obtained by the Deep Levels Co. and the
Central Co.—the only entrance to the
latter’s mine was through the tunnels of
the Marshall Hill End property adjoin-
ing—against W. A. J. Marshall from
entering and operating upon the Central
Co.’s property. The services of D. M.
Marshall as manager of the Deep Levels
Co. were dispensed with.
In January, 1921, a prpspectus of Hill
End Junction Gold Mining Co., N.L.,
was issued, with C. A. Cooper and
"Wonder what gives this beer so much froth?”
“That’s the excise.”
Alexander Marshall on the board.
Vendors received 56,000 fully-paid 2s.
shares. One of the properties was
G.L. 326, adjoining Marshall’s Hill End
Gold Mines, N.L. This prospectus
asserted that the reason why the gold
cut off suddenly at Rapp’s claim had
been discovered by Marshall’s co. Aud-
ley Brownlow was legal manager of this
particular float.
In 1922 we find W. A. J. Marshall’s
name on the prospectus of Hawkins Hill
Main Reefs, N.L., and the firm of Brown-
low, Cooper and Oertel inviting subscrip-
tions for shares. The Reefs Co. issued
50,000 fully-paid 2s. shares to the
vendors, and took over a property ad-
joining the Deep Levels Co,
On May 3 last the prospectus of
Hawkin’s Hill Centre Blocks G.M. Co.,
N.L., was issued. The co. with the
apostrophe is acquiring interests in
G.L. No. 326 at Hawkins Hill, and
its fancy also lives in the past.
A table of capitalisations of Hill End
cos. as in 1872 has been reprinted
from the earlier prospectus, as is a list
of share-market valuations of various
mining claims in the same era. “In the
days of the Hill End boom: Facts and
figures from the ‘S. M. Herald’ of 1872,”
is another section that will be familiar
to those who dropped money in the 1921
float.
In the case of the present float—the
70,000 3s. shares offered are declared to
have been subscribed before the pros-
pectus was issued—the vendors take
40,000 f.-p. 3s. shares. This co., too, is
in search of “the continuation of the
world-famous chutes of gold,” while the
property is portion of “the famous rich
goldmines of Hawkins Hill.” And
W. A. J. Marshall and Alexander Mar-
shall are on the board, supported by
Fred Oertel and four others. The pros-
pectus is mostly ancient records and
reports, the latest of which appears to be
of 1911 vintage. There is no mention of
gold production during the past 25 years,
when a number of cos. which should be
well known to W. A. J. Marshall have
operated on Hill End from time to time.
Are Profits Wrong?
“Simple Peter”: J. T. Lang used the
bigger profits, of a number of companies
as an argument in his censure-motion
attack on the Stevens Government the
other day. On occasions he has proved
that he is no fool ; therefore it seems
that he was out to please the extremists.
What are profits, and who makes them
or strives to make them?
Profits, generally speaking, are legiti-
mate gains from capital or effort. The
worker is concerned in profits equally
with the businessman. The man on the
basic wage claims that he is not receiv-
ing enough to enable him to live and
save. In other words, he is not making
a profit on his labor. If he is able to
bank a few shillings a week after meet-
ing his living expenses, he is making a
profit, just the same as the company
which earns enough over its working ex-
penses * and depreciation to pay a divi-
dend to its shareholders.
Dividends are the wages of invest-
ments, and when spent increase the velo-
city of trade the same as ordinary wages.
Labor men ought to worship profits.
The trouble with the world to-day is that
there is too little profit-making. Men
will not invest their money because the
prospect of a return is uncertain, and the
workers are largely dependent on relief
schemes (rarely finding their accustomed
occupation), because restrictions and
taxes have made business and industry
too much of a gamble. If the worker is
entitled to a larger share of the product
of his labor, then clearly his employer
must be assured of a return on his in-
vestment, otherwise he cannot even guar-
antee employment, let alone higher
wages.
I am not prepared to argue that
profits are not sometimes wrongly
applied, but it is futile and absurd to
advance that as a reason why there
should be wholesale restriction. Enter-
prise of any kind cannot be conducted
without profit, and the State, as an em-
ployer, is not excepted. The only differ-
ence is that when State enterprises lose
money the Treasurer is able to make it
up out of the taxpayers. The private
employer has to foot his own bill.
For the first nine months of the
1932-33 season, Australian exported
759,000,0001 b. of wool, worth £29,539,000
in local currency. For the same period
of 1933-34 the figures were 744,846,0001 b.,
worth £52,000,000. The average price
realised for greasy was 16d. in the later
period.
* * * *
The estimated loss on sugar-growing
and -milling in the Lower Burdekin (Q.)
district amounts to £167,000 for the
season. The average
price for sugar grown
inside the peak-year
limit has been de-
clared at £l7 4s. 3d.
per ton of raws. Four
mills in the Lower
Burdekin turned out
18,175 tons in excess
of the limit, and this
is credited to the
grower at world par-
ity. Thus growers in
the Inkerman district
will receive only £l4
13s. Id. a ton, which
is below the cost of
production. It is 'a
sad ending to a bum-
per harvest—the larg-
est Australia has ever
seen.
* * *
A. R. Townsend, of
the Customs, who
knows the sugar in-
dustry as few others
do, told the Common-
wealth Grants Com-
mission that the cost
of the sugar embargo
to Australia was
£6,000,000 a year at
present world parity.
World parity, how-
ever, did not apply to any civilised coun-
try, owing to tariffs, and the average
European retail price was 3jd., as against
4d. a pound in Australia. At world
prices all the principal export countries
are showing heavy losses.
* * * *
Signs so far are that the Federal
and N. S. Wales Governments will
adopt substantially the Newnes com-
mittee’s proposals. The C.O.R. is
favorably disposed towards distribut-
ing the spirit, subject to satisfactory,
road tests. Federal politicians have been
influenced largely by defence necessities ;
N.S.W. by the unemployment problem.
A capital of £600,000, to be supplied in
equal subscriptions by the Governments
and private investors, is recommended,
with total exemption from excise for four
years, and an adjusted rate thereafter.

Victoria’s yield of dried grapes for the
season will be about 38,500 tons, con-
siderably less than last year. Excessive
rains have hindered drying. Wine grapes
will equal last year’s quantity.

These last few years have, in a marked or lesser degree,

accurately the needs of the future, it is possible to provide
for them.

THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
Impeding Interest-reduction
J. M. Keynes recently pointed out that
even the present reduced rate of 3| p.c.
on long-term gilt-edged stocks is much
in excess of the average yield on Consols
for the 40 years previous to the war.
In 1897, after the great depression of the
early ’nineties, British Consols gave a
net return of 2.44 p.c. Now, when the
world is struggling with a depression of
much greater magnitude, Keynes be-
lieves that “equilibrium level” is not
above 2\ p.c., maybe less.
That “equilibrium level” of interest in
Australia has not been reached by a long
way is shown by the trade-union unem-
ployment figures for the first quarter of
1934: 21.9 p.c. of men out of work.
The Commonwealth Bank is alive to the
position and is striving to get rates down.
Recently it reduced interest rates on over-
drafts by another } p.c. But it is dis-
couraging to find State Governments,
directly and indirectly, borrowing money
on long-term investment at rates out of
all proportion to the bank overdraft rate.
The Queensland Government has guaran-
teed a loan for a road and bridge to a
seaside resort: £lOO,OOO ; rate of interest
for 20 years, p.c. Such loans, though
raised by private cos., are in effect Gov-
ernment bond issues for long terms.
They are nullifying the efforts of the
Commonwealth Bank to reduce interest
and preventing a fall in overdraft rates.
As long as State Governments continue
to do this sort of thing, and offer tax-
free loans, the banks can only lend at a
price competitive with the gilt-edged
bond-issue rate; otherwise their fixed
deposits will leave them and they will
have nothing to lend.
If we are to avoid inflation and un-
sound money, lenders must be prepared
to accept low rates of interest until Aus-
tralia recovers from the gruelling of the
past four years. —J. P. Abbott (N.S.W.).
Not Land-minded
You are barking up the wrong tree
(B. 18/4/’34). Our Australian boys in
the towns and cities will not go on to
the land. Proof? Well, about four years
ago our headquarters in Melbourne of
the Big Brother movement received many
letters from parents there complaining
that we were importing boys and not
giving Australian boys a similar chance.
To satisfy parents we advertised for
youths to go out on exactly the same
conditions as the Little Brothers. The
only response came from three appli-
cants, and when they found they would
have to go to Gippsland or the Wim-
mera they each declined. —Yours etc.,
F. W. Strack (Vic.).
Italians in N. S. Wales
Whatever their shortcomings, they live
within their incomes. Fifty per cent, of
my trade in farmers’ needs is done with
Italian settlers, of whom my district has
a large proportion, and in two years I
have had only one bad debt as against
a score of others which have been wiped
off. The great majority of our
Italians are hardworking, thrifty farmers.
Many have children, born in the dis-
trict and attending local schools. —

The N.S.W. School-teacher’s Pay
Consider the position of one who
entered the service some years ago and
is now fully qualified. After five years
at a high school he has, at the age of
18, gained a scholarship to the Teachers’
College. He has attended the university
for three years and graduated with
honors in some course taken. He has
attended a professional course at the
Teachers’ College for one year, qualify-
ing for a 2A classification. If, after a
period of three years or even more, he
has secured a'“skill mark” that requires
high teaching efficiency, he will be classi-
fied as a 2A assistant and entitled to a
salary of £5 10s. per week, subject to
wage tax and superannuation. In other
words, this overpaid young man will
receive £265 per year. It is difficult to
believe that a profession upon which
such high responsibilities rest will con-
tinue to attract the better types in the
community when it is subjected to
such conditions.—Yours etc., Dominie
(N.S.W.).
Wines and Names
Why bring the war and Australia’s
losses into this purely business contro-
versy? In common with all my country-
men, I feel a profound gratitude for the
precious aid that Australia gave to
France during that terrible period. The
hardships undergone together create an
unbreakable bond between us. Colonel
Fallon should remember that even be-
tween brothers who have the deepest
feelings for each other questions of in-
terest arise which often create divergences
of opinion, but which never affect in
any way the brotherly love which unites
them.
It is rather amusing to read such
paragraphs as “If the French succeed
in robbing the Empire wine indus-
tries of the use of these trade terms.”
Strangely enough, it is the French who
are now attempting to rob the others!
Should it not be the other way round?
As regards whisky, did I ever contest
Scotland’s and Ireland’s right to appro-
pnate that term? Colonel Fa !J on
rest quite assured France will never
manufacture whiskies, the French oeing
born wine- and brandy-drinkers, and nat-
ing even the smell of what they call an
awful medicine. . f
If France altered fte boundanes of
Champagne or the limited Bourgogne
areas, it was to protect her producers
Only last month a decree was issued that
from next year the growers of certain
limited areas in Champagne would not
be permitted to market or label any wine
under the name of “Vins Mousseux,
thus leaving the privilege of the sole use
of the word “Champagne” to these very
districts. One can see how strict are our
own laws in these wine matters,
Therefore, on reading over and over
again Colonel Fallon’s article, J do not
really find any claim for the title pre-
ceding it, “Australia’s Overwhelming
Case.” His remarks in the daily press
about Mr. Percy Wilkinson, ex-director
of the Commonwealth Laboratory, an
authority on wine matters, are really un-
kind. To call him with some contempt an
analytical chemist by profession denotes
an uncalled-for bitterness towards an
Australian gentleman for whom 1 nave
great esteem, and whose remarkable
works merit the greatest admiration,
Does Colonel Fallon reproach him for
having been impartial in his articles on
wine matters? — Georges Bader, trade
Commissioner for France.

A Remedy for Magic
“N.0.R.”: The Papuan constable
mentioned by “Pourri Pourri” (B.
9/5/’34) who sank a sorcerer in a water-
hole tied to a pole had nothing on an
old-time constable I knew in Cape York,
where two local bone-pointers were
carrying on a sort of match against each
other, to the depletion of both their
tribes. Capturing the warlocks, the Force
tied them firmly together with a bridle
rein, wrapped them up in an old tar-
paulin and told them and the assembled
tribes that when they felt that the magic
power had departed from them, or when
one had shown that he was so deeply
possessed of the devil that he would
polish off the other, the bird of freedom
would once more be seen in the vicinity.
After two days of proximity—a double-
wrapped tarpaulin with your mortal
enemy clasped to your breast can be very
hot and trying, especially when your sole
diet is Epsom and spring water —the
magicians announced themselves normal,
and intimated to the tribes that the sole
efficient bone-pointer in the district was
now the constable. He kinged it over
the myalls until he reaped the reward of
virtue and became an acting-sergeant in
a city suburb, where the only bones
which ever harmed anybody were cubes
which had six spots on one side of them.
“Green Island”: Cairns got a pleasant
but unexpected compliment from J. D.
Calder, consulting naval architect to the
great firm of John Jackson, which is
building the Singapore base:
For its size I think the harbor at Cairns
is superior to any in the world.
He added that when in Cairns he had
jokingly compared it to Sydney Harbor,
whereupon the prideful Cairnsites re-
plied : “God made Sydney, but we made
Cairns.” If Mr. Calder does not leave
his bones in Hobart, Gladstone, Rabaul,
Darwin or Twofold Bay, the sponsors of
all of which will dispute his ruling, he
still has several years’ work to do on
Singapore.

“Samurai”: Among the losses in the
recent cyclone up north was that of the
lugger Mildred, commanded by Kono,
who found the Wilson Shoal during ’32.
Kono took bearings, sounded, reported to
the Sub-Collector of Customs at Towns-
ville, and felt at that he had done a fair
thing. Though that shoal was right in the
track of shipping, and though the Hydro-
graphic Dept, had a naval survey party
working less than a hundred miles dis-
tant (at Molle Islands), it did nothing
for a year or more. Then, with a flour-
ish of trumpets and with much heralding
in the press, H.M.A.S. Moresby discov-
ered the shoal which Kono had found
and reported. The Moresby had passed
the place at least a hundred times.
It is good policy to reward men like
Kono. If there is no money to spare
there is honor in plenty. Let the shoal
be named the Kono Shoal instead of
the Wilson Shoal.
* * * *
“Stuart”: If it has got all Dr. Base-
dow’s collection of native curios for £5OO,
the Commonwealth Government has
made a fine bargain for Australia. The
South Australian was greatly liked by the
natives, because, though he was apt to
be intolerant of European nature, he
always had a smile for the black man.
He was a keen student of native tongues,
but Nature had given him the kind of
throat and larynx which made him sound
in some tribal languages like a Honan
Chinaman wrestling with Czech. The
big, kindly fellow never realised that
often extra-rare weapons and precious
carving were the rewards which big
Aruntas bestowed on him in payment
for the special pleasure which they got
in listening to him talking. The Cen-
tralian natives owed a great deal to Base-
dow, and he rarely retired from their
camps without bearing away tokens of
native appreciation. And if they laughed
at his accent, nobody enjoyed the joke
better than himself.
* * * *
“Kaloa”: The recent burning of the
railway bond store at Darwin, with the
season’s up-country loading, emphasises
how near the empty North lives to starva-
tion, which now threatens many an in-
land station. The situation is serious
enough to call for precautionary action
by the Federal Government. Not so
many years ago the writer found the
population of Boorooloola, most of
whom were over 60 years of age, living
entirely without flour because the boat
was six months late, and they did not
appear to be less hungry when they heard
several weeks afterwards Mr. George
Pearce’s assurance that the boat had been
sent. Every family which takes children
into the bush of the N.T. to-day risks
their lives unless it owns its own private
transport service. Even if it were to cost
a few thousand pounds a year, better
arrangements for regular food carriage
at cheaper rates than the £6O per ton
which it costs to reach a lot of points
where there is settlement would be a dis-
tinct encouragement to the colonists.
The fast patrol boat for which the Ter-
ritory has been agitating for years and
a few light trucks would do wonders.
* * * *
“Lugger’s Mate”: Green Island, on
the inner fringe of the Barrier Reef, near
Cairns, which inter-State steamers intend
to make an extraordinary port of call
during the tourist seasons, has a history.
It was seen and named by Captain Cook
in 1770, although Low Island, nearly 40
miles north of Cape Grafton, is often
ticketed as “Captain Cook’s first-seen
coral isle.” After the settlement of Cairns
Green Island became a happy hunting-
ground for fishing men, especially those
interested in beche-de-mer. About 100
years after Cook passed Dan Kelly, a
beche-de-mer fisherman, left Townsville
in his cutter, the Goodwill, with his
mates Rose and White. They took on
“Is your wife lazy?”
“My oath she is! Sooner’n walk a few yards for a block of wood to split, she’ll
want the one I’m sittin’ on.”
board some abos. at Palm Island, and
while at Green Island the natives killed
two of the whites. Kelly got away to
Oyster Bay in Michaelmas Reef (another
tourist attraction nowadays), where he
met Phil Garland. They returned to
Green Island, but the Goodwill had van-
ished. A year later Kelly was again on
the island, where he witnessed the mas-
sacre of three members of the crew of
the Margaret Jane by another set of
natives. On it are now a kiosk and a
jetty stretching out about 850 ft. to deep
water.
* * * *
“Mt. Mulligan”: Mareeba, a North
Queensland centre which once bulked
quite big as a tin-producer but now
specialises in growing cigarette tobacco,
has had its holiest feelings outraged by
the fact that Prince Henry’s itinerary
does not include it or any other leading
N.Q. centre. In a long resolution point-
ing out the scenic beauty of the Cairns
hinterland and the general importance of
the locality, the Mareeba Chamber of
Commerce has issued an emphatic pro-
test against the passing over of its claims.
But Mareeba is not alone in its misfor-
tune. Cooktown, where the local goats
have mostly taken the place of human
inhabitants, and Thursday Island, that
Nippon-super-Queensland, would un-
doubtedly interest the Prince, and so
might Bramble Cay if he cares for crabs.
It is obviously impossible to include all
these centres in a restricted tour, and
Mareeba will just have to lump it—
or start a secession movement, like W.A.
* * * *
“Goa”: It looks as if interest in Cale-
don Bay may now sleep until Buck-Eye
and his warriors scupper a few more
Japanese. A week or two ago Constable
Hall was detailed to visit the region lone-
handed and bring back, witnesses; but
the new Acting-Administrator and Com-
missioner of Police has cancelled the
senseless trip, and “future action against
the natives brought to Darwin is a matter
for Government consideration.” It is to
be hoped that it will think long before
proceeding on confessions which might
or might not have been pure bravado
and call the farce off. Everybody has
had a fair innings—the missionaries their
limelight and a Government subsidy, the
abos. a free trip and some new experi-
ences, the flapper press its sensations and
the taxpayers their usual privilege of pay-
ing for the whole muddle. So everybody
should be satisfied.
* * * *
“Travel Stain”: Restriction of sugar-
production this season might result from
the talks and conferences that take up the
time of the industry, or it might be due
to malignant weather. At any rate, the
far northern sector of the sugar belt is
experiencing its annual conflict with
flood rains which are lasting well into
the yeai\ The area north of Townsville
has already suffered its seventh railway
holdup this year. It is due to flood
waters covering one or more of the
series of low-level bridges on the way
to Cairns. Ingham and Mossman, re-
spectively south and north of the Cairns-
Innisfail area, have had too much rain
to suit the standing crop, and it has in-
terfered with the planting-out of 1935
crops. It looks as though both areas
will be restricted in output next year.
On the other hand, growers in the Bur-
dekin are watering their crops owing to
the drought, but the cane seems to be
bearing up well, and, in fact, may have
to be restricted by enactment —probably
to a greater extent than in any other dis-
trict. Around Bundaberg the weather
has been sufficiently reasonable to benefit
the yield normally, although some
growers have been assisted by water
from the new irrigation scheme. At
Mackay the standing crop has been
helped by the weather, which, however,
has been a bit dry for the 1935 planting.

“James Thistleseed”: Talking of gold.
I remember meeting an old fellow who
told me that he once had a ton of it and
15 tons of silver. He was a queer old
boy with fuzzy hair and a well-trimmed
beard. He claimed to have got it by way-
laying three mule-teams that were carry-
ing it to the coast in Panama. Forty-five
soldiers guarded the teams and their
treasure. The mules veritably stag-
gered under the loads, and their
bells made the best carillon he ever
heard. It was an easy capture ; he
and his small band of followers
gave the Spaniards the knife and
the musket-ball, got away with the booty
cleanly and took it back to Eng-
land under a promise to share it with
the Queen. His name, he told me, was
Sir Francis Drake. I didn’t have the
time to find out how he had come to be
working a claim near Irvinebank. Pos-
sibly Queen Elizabeth beat him for his
share of the spoils. From what I have
read of Elizabeth, I wouldn’t put it
past her.
“Australia Jane's’* Budget
Two of the oldest families on the Downs
will be united when Ruth Godsall, who has
just accepted a diamond ring from Ted O'Brien,
adds the plain gold to it. Ruth is a daughter
of the Dick Godsalls. Her father has been
mayor of Toowoomba on more than one occa-
sion, but that is a family habit. The original
Godsall was one of the first mayors, and his
elder son E.J. also wore the rabbitskins for
a period. Ted O’Brien’s family settled down
when Toowoomba was still “The Swamps” and
Drayton a flourishing township. His parents
had a flair for land purchase, and started a
still-flourishing flour mill.
Kit Winter, a talented young thing who has
written at least two successful plays—“ The
Toast Is Anzac, Gentlemen” and “Wool,
Woman and Whine"- —came north from Sydney
recently to meet a little sunshine. The climate
has behaved abominably to her, and the skies
have wept copiously ever since she arrived.
Most of her time has been spent in Toowoomba.
Margaret Buchanan Millar arrives in Bris-
bane by the Ormonde later in the month. For
12 months she has been studying in the very
swishest of the London and Paris beauty
salons. Margaret is not quite decided whether
she will settle in Brisbane or Sydney, but we
all hope she will stay here and heavily sub-
edit our crow’s-feet before the royal visit is
due. Margaret’s mother is the matron aboard
the Nieuw Zeeland.
The usual bevy of June brides may be ex-
pected this year. Barbara Corrie and John
Court have a date at the altar on June 9, and
Dulcie Dunlop and Charlie Ladds also will ex-
change vows next month. Dulcie is a member
of the Brisbane Repertory Society, and every-
one is hoping that she will not altogether for-
sake that body when she has Charlie’s ham
and eggs to cook every morning.
One of the latest engagements is that of
Brenda Wienholt, younger daughter of the late
Daniel Wienholt and Mrs. E. J. Wienholt, of
Chelmer, to Kenneth Wetherell, elder son of
the R. Wetherells, of New Farm. The bride-
to-be is a very pretty girl, and has inherited
much of her mother’s capacity for organisation.
The Hostel for Dogs and Horses and a home
for elderly gentlewomen owe their existence to
Mrs. Wienholt.
Various parties were staged during the last
couple of weeks for the Blaikie Websters, who
are off to England. Brisbane hopes it won’t
be long before they make another trip hither.
Saw a young thing in Queen-street the other
day who was wearing a delightful tailored coat
frock of leaf-brown woollen rep, furs and a
smart brown velour lid. Then one saw her feet.
They were pretty feet, but she wore no stock-
ings, and on one slim ankle was the thinnest of
thin gold chains, which dangled above her
high-heeled shoes.
Mary Macgregor, the auburn-haired daugh-
ter of the P. B. Macgregors—father is a bar-
rister, and mamma was one of the late Dick
Newton’s handsome daughters—is playing lead
with the Coventry Repertory Players in Eng-
land. Younger sister Kathleen also is showing
distinct ability as an actress, and is with Bris-
bane Repertory.
For five years Evelyne Winship, J.P., has
been the branch secretary to New Zealand Per-
petual Forests. Now she has been
granted six months’ furlough, and
is to visit her home town, Whitley
Bay, Northumberland (England).
The lass is a good hockey player
and a golf enthusiast, and is hon.
secretary of the associates’ com-
mittee of the Oxley Golf Club.
The committee of the Bush
Book Club is planning a series
of parties and entertainments to
raise funds. Last year it held a
successful entertainment at Cre-
morne, but that meant a consider-
able amount of work for Mrs. Fir-
min McKinnon, the secretary; so
this year the president has de-
cided that everybody will lend a
hand. Only bush-dwellers know
what a boon the club has proved.
Reginald Thompson, now in the Bene-
volent Home at Dunwich, has had an
adventurous career. Many years he spent
as a member of the North-west Mounted
Police, of Canada. Then he went to the war;
and for some years afterwards amused himself
by making toy theatres. One of his best works
was a “theatre” with a cowboy drama in full
swing. The tiny doll figures were complete
even to chaps, and revolvers. And in the centre
of the stage lay the dead villain, his sombrero
flattened under his head, and his toes stiffly
turned up.
One of the most interesting visitors of the
week was Miles Franklin, who has been stay-
ing with Mrs. Roland Statham at Taylor’s
Plains, Mungallala. Wearing a smartly-
tailored coat and skirt, and with an unquench-
able twinkle in her eye, the N.S.W. novelist
entertained several friends of the Inky Way
at lunch at the Canberra, where she stayed
during her time in Brisbane. The author of
“Old Blastus of Bandicoot” is an interesting
person. Helen Simpson is one of her dearest
London chums. Helen married Dr. Browne, a
son of Rolf Boldrewood, and the “Boldre-
woods” and the Franklins were friends and
neighbors when the colonies were in their
swaddling clothes.
Another good Australian who blew in from
America this week was Frederick Trouten
Small. His grandfather, who will be remem-
bered by oldsters in the Harbor City, was that
Captain Trouten who got his ship out of Apia
Harbor in the famous hurricane. Fred, who was
an engineer, saw service overseas with the Aus-
tralian sappers, and then acquired a job with
the Federal Government. After that he
wandered off to England, and for some years
had a job with a big firm of textile manufac-
turers in Derbyshire. Five ycarj ago he was
sent to a branch of the firm situated in Mary-
land (U.S.A.), of which he is now chief en-
gineer. The place employs 72,000 hands. His
visit is just to look up sister Mrs. Jeff Wool-
cock in Brisbane and brother Dick on his
station in Central Queensland.
Lots of things which were started with tre-
mendous enthusiasm in the war years since
have died quietly natural deaths, but the Arts
and Crafts workroom which was established
17 years ago at Kangaroo Point still goes its
way. Most of the women who spend their days
there are those who began the work. There are
50 men on the books, and the average attend-
ance is 12 to 15 daily. Any Digger is welcome,
but the place is actually run for the really hard-
up returned soldier with little or no pension.
Delightful toys and utilities are made there—
mostly from waste products; A timber mill,
a bootmaking factory and a tailor —the latter
hands over all his snippings of woollen
materials, and they are made into floor-mats—
provide the material, which would be of no use
to any other workshop. The R.S.S.L. is trying
to arrange for a Queen-street display.
Nancy Martins is off to Asia next month to
stay with her sister, Mrs. R. D. Gall, at Hong
Kong. She will be away for some months.
Another intending tourist is the Philp lady, who
leaves next month for England and Scotland.

Which is the faster wicket —a first-class Aus-
tralian turf wicket or an ordinary concrete
wicket with matting ? —l3Bl. .
A properly-constructed concrete wicket
covered with a coir matting would be faster
than a .well-prepared turf wicket such as the
one at present at the S.C.G. A concrete wicket
with a canvas matting is of about the same
pace as a turf wicket.
By whom was the elaborate tomb at Kew
Cemetery, Melbourne, erected, and to whose
memory ? What was the cost ? 1365. _
By Dr. Springthorpe as a memorial to his wife.
He has been buried there since. The memorial
cost between £lO,OOO and £15,000. It is a
most elaborate affair and contains tablets giving
details of Mrs. Springthorpe’s life.
(1) At what age is a man in N.S.W. entitled
to the old-age pension ? (2) What amount may
he earn annually in addition ? (3) Where to
apply for necessary form of application ? (4)
Having no rponey or property, what amount of
pension would he be entitled to ? —1320.
(1) He must have attained the age of 65
years, and must have resided in the Com-
monwealth for a continuous period of 20
years. (2) A pensioner’s income, including
all income, must not exceed £7B per
annum. (3) Any post office. (4) The maximum
rate of pension payable is £45 10s. p.a—3ss.
per fortnight. In the case of husband and wife,
except where they are legally separated, income
and property of each are deemed to be owned
by both in equal shares. Also, where a pen-
sioner has property other than his home, rate
of pension payable is subject to a deduction of
£1 for every complete £lO by which the net
capital value of such property exceeds £5O.
When I was a youngster 1 read a lot of books
by a writer named G. A. Henty. When did
he die ? Can you tell me anything about him
—1467.
George Alfred Henty was born near Cam-
bridge in 1832 and died in 1902. He was edu-
cated at Westminster School and Cams College,
Cambridge, but left without taking a degree.
On the outbreak of the Crimean War he volun-
teered for active service, and his letters describ-
ing the siege of Sebastopol were published in
the “Morning Advertiser.” In 1865 he became
a journalist, and wrote for the “Standard,” going
upon many famous expeditions. His first boys
book, “Out in the Pampas,” appeared in 1868,
and was followed by “The Young Franc-
tireurs” (1872), a tale of the Franco-Prussian
war. He wrote about 80 tales of adventure
for boys.
What is a Eurasian ?— 1346.
The term means a European-Asian hybrid.
It originated in India, where it was used
to denote children born of Hindu mothers
and European (especially Portuguese) fathers.
Anthropologist Joseph Deniker defines a Eura-
sian group including people (Ugrians, lurks,
Tartars, etc.) represented in both continents.
What are the high seas, and are they free
to all nations ? —1353.
The term “the high seas” is applied t<3 all
those places in oceans not under the sovereignty
of adjacent States. Use of the high seas is
free to all nations, subject to certain inter-
national laws, principal of which are that
mutiny, barratry, etc., are punishable wherever
committed.
Where and when was the first boatrace
held in Australia ? Crews competing and the
result ? —1344.
It was rowed on May 16, 1818, in four-
oared gigs over a course from Bradley’s Head
to Sydney Cove. Four crews took part, cap-
tained by Lawlie, an officer of the Batavia,
Magnus Johnson, master of the Guildford,
John Bell, master of the Minerva, and John
Piper, of Sydney. Piper’s crew won with ease
in 15 minutes.
What is the Translators’ Guild of London ?
—1332.
This organisation has been formed to raise
the general standard of translations, and to
form a point of contact between translators and
publishers, editors and theatrical managements.
It often happens that a publisher must be
satisfied with a makeshift rendering of a book,
through lack of an efficient linguist and writer
of English. The Translators’ Guild hopes to
overcome this difficulty by enrolling as mem-
bers only those who can satisfy its advisory
committee of their linguistic and literary ability.
The committee is representative of both pub-
lishers and translators. The secretary of the
guild is Cyrus Brooks, 188 Piccadilly, London,
W.l.
(1) Who wrote the melody of “God Save
the King” ? (2) When did the British adopt
the tune as a national anthem ? —1289.
(1) Henry Carey sang the air as his own
composition in 1740, but the opinion was held
among musicians at the time that the tune
Was a copy of one published by John Bull in
1619. There are no reliable records available
concerning Bull’s composition. Some authori-
ties favor the claim of James Oswald, a Scot
who settled in London in 1742. (2) About
1745. Germany and Denmark adopted the
‘same air as a national anthem some time
between 1745 and 1800.
Biographical details concerning an Austra-
lian writer named Francis William Lauderdale
Adams, with a list of his works and a brief
summing-up of his standing as a writer ?
1383.
He was not an Australian. He was the son
of Prof. Andrew Leith Adams and was born
at Malta on September 27, 1862. Educated
at a private school in Shrewsbury and after-
wards in Paris, he came to Australia in 1882,
after two years’ school-teaching. In 1884 he
published “ ‘Henry’ and Other Poems”; in
1885 “Leicester, an Autobiography”; in
1886 “Australian Essays,” “Madeline Brown’s
Murder” and “Poetical Works.” In 1888 there
appeared in Sydney “Songs of the Army of
the Night,” which afterwards went through
three editions in London. While in Sydney
he was on the staff of The Bulletin. He
left Australia in 1889, and in 1891 published
in London “John Webb’s End,” and contri-
buted sketches to the “Fortnightly .Review
After two years’ stay in England (during which
he published "The Melbournians ) he spent
the winter of 1892-93 in Alexandria, struggling
in spite of an incurable hing-disease to finish a
book criticising British policy in Egypt. Dur
ing the summer of 1893 he went to live a
Margate, England, where he committed suicide
on September 4, 1893. “Australian Life and
“The New Egypt appeared in 18V3, tne
latter after his death; “Tiberius” (a drama) and
“A Child of the Age” in 1894 and “Essays on
Modernity” in 1899. Apart from Tiberius
his work is more remarkable for promise than
for performance.
Did the Australian aborigines fish with line
and hooks ? If so, of what were the hooks
made, and where can 1 find a description o)
them ? —l4OO.
Use of hooks was universal among prac-
tically all coastal tribes. The hooks were made ot
vine tendrils, eagle-hawk talons, hone, mollusc
shells, tortoise-shells or cocoanut shells. Com-
posite hooks were made with small bones ol
the emu, kangaroo or catfish as barbs, or two
pieces of wood were joined by resin and twine.
See Roughley’s “Fishes of Australia.
Method of catching estuary perch< ?— 1366.
During warm weather rod and line are
mostly used. The bait varies according to the
season. Moths, crickets and grasshoppers form
a very attractive bait, and are eagerly seized,
the hook being suspended near the surface.
During the colder months the hook is allowed
to drop close to the bottom, the most success-
ful bait in this case being prawns, worms and
the larvre of wood-boring beetles. A nsn
bait or an artificial fly is sometimes used.
Is the fruit of the Cydonia japonica edible, as
a preserve ? —1269. , „
Cydonia japonica is an ornamental ilowering
plant suited for training on walls, etc. No
trace of fruit being useful as a preserve in
any reference books in Sydney libraries.
(1) What is meant by “caste" in India ? (2)
Who are the “untouchables” ?—1407.
(1) Caste is native social status governed by
birth and religious prejudice. Members of dif-
ferent castes may neither eat or drink together
nor partake of food prepared by one of a lower
caste than themselves. The Brahmin represents
the highest caste; should even the shadow ol
an outsider fall across his food he will not
touch it. Loss of caste means social ostra-
cism and religious excommunication. (2) Ine
“untouchables” are the bhangis, the sweepei or
lowest caste in the Hindu system, who perform
the scavenging, sanitary work and most de-
grading menial tasks. In the south they are
segregated in colonies outside the towns, to
some of which they are denied entrance when the
sun casts a long shadow by w b] c b a bigh-caste
Hindu would consider himself defiled; they
are also denied civil rights and education.
Gandhi’s attempt to raise the status of the un-
touchables is really a colossal crusade against
the evils of the caste system.
What is homoeopathy? —l4s2.
The name given to a system of medicine in-
troduced by a German physician, Samuel Hah-
nemann, who was born at Leipzig in 1755 and
died in 1843. In his “Organon of Medicine,
Hahnemann set forth the principles on which
his system was based. These were; (1) that
morbid conditions are cured by medicines which
would produce the disease in healthy bodies,
in accordance with the old belief expressed by
the Latin phrase Similia similibus curantur
(Like is cured by like). (2) That drugs adminis-
tered should be simple and not compounded.
(3) That in most cases only very small quan-
tities of the drug should be given, on the theory
of dynamisation, or increase of force with dimi-
nution of matter, such dynamisation, it is
alleged, being produced by trituration.
(1) What is meant by the term “farad” ? (2)
What relationship do the microfarad and micro-
microfarad bear to the farad ? (3) Any other
units of capacity ? (4) Would an air condenser
have the same capacity as a similar condenser
spaced with mica ? —1478.
(1) A condenser has a capacity of one farad
when, if charged with a potential of one volt,
it will hold one coulomb of electricity. (2) The
microfarad is one millionth of a farad; _ the
micro-microfarad, one millionth of a micro-
farad. (3) The “jar,” used by the British Admir-
alty, which is one nine-hundredth of a micro-
farad; and the centimetre, or absolute unit of
capacity, there being 900,000 cms. to a micro-
farad. (4) If the size and number of the plates
and their distance apart were the same in both
cases, the mica condenser would have five times
the capacity of the air condenser.
In a tennis match the receiver calls “Not
ready" for a service. The ball strikes beyond
the service line, and the receiver then claims
that the service was a fault, arid as a fault can-
not be returned; the fact that he was not ready
does not alter the case. What is the position ?
—1442.
It is a let, and the server has two services
to deliven A player cannot call “Not ready”
and then have the service count or not as suits
his interest.
(1) Smith is on trial for murder. Can his
counsel call Smith as a witness any time during
case for the defence and /or can he make a
statement from the dock before jury retires to
consider verdict ? (2) If so, is this procedure
uniform in criminal courts throughout Austra-
Ua n) The 4 Crimes Act (N.S/VV.) provides that
every accused person in a criminal proceeding
and the husband or wife of such P ers °." 1
be competent but not compellable to g evi-
dence, provided that no such person char g ed
with an indictable offence shall be liable: tobe
called as a witness on behalf of the prosecu
tion or be questioned on cross-examination as
to his previous character or antecedents, b e >
accused person on trial, whether defended by
counsel or not, may make a statement at t
close of the case for the prosecution, and be-
fore calling any witnesses in defence, without
being liable to examination, and may afterwards
personally or by counsel address.the jury. u>
Practically to the same effect.
Are wood-swallows Australian birds, or are
they to be found in other parts of the wo Jf mr
How many species exist in Australia / What
are the distinguishing colorings of the more
common species and in what parts of Australia
are they to be found ? —1440.
Arboreal perching birds of the genus Artamus
and family Artamidce, they are confined to
southern Asia, Malaysia, Australia, Tasmania
and the Pacific islands east to riji, head-
quarters are in Australia, where six species aie
found. The commonest species through south-
ern Australia and Tasmania is the sordid wood-
swallow (A. cyanopterus), otherwise known as
the blue or bush martin, a dark blue-grey bird
with white edges to the wings and tip of the
tail. Other widely distributed forms are the
white-browed wood-swallow (A. supercthosus),
often called the summer martin—the most hand-
some member of the family, slaty-grey above,
chestnut below, with a white patch above the
eye __ an d the masked wood-swallow 04. persona-
tus). Both these species are found throughout
the continent, but only as summer immigrants
in the southern States; neither reaches Tas-
mania The white-rumped wood-swallow {A
leucorhynchus ) is found through eastern and
northern Australia and in Malaysia, and the
two remaining species occur in inland and
northern Australia.
IVhat are the conditions under which a widow
in N. S. Wales is entitled . to the widows’ pen-
The widow must be domiciled in N.S.W. on
the date of the death of her husband. She must
be resident in N.S.W. at the date of her appli-
cation for a pension, and must have been so tor
three years. She must have at the date ol
application a child under the age oi 14 years

Details concerning the Cutty Sark -145. V
The Cutty Sark was launched at Dumbarton
in 1869, her owner, Capt. John Willis, of Lon-
don, having decided to challenge the Aberdeen
clipper Thermopylae, which had m 12 months
become undisputed queen of the fliers. She
was only 963 tons gross, and her designer,
Hercules Clinton, had given no promise of pro-
ducing such a masterpiece. In the China tea
trade the Cutty Sark did nothing remarkable in
the way of fast passages, and it was not until
she entered the Australian wool trade that
she showed her real mettle. Her best passage
was from Sydney to Ushant in 67 days. This
time was actually beaten by the Thermopylae,
but it was the Cutty Sark’s consistency which
earned her the title of flier. Her slowest passage
was 93 days, and she rarely exceeded 82 days
between 1883 and 1895. In the latter year she
was sold to the Portuguese, and sailed undei
that flag until 1922, when she was purchased
by Captain Dowman, a British skipper, as a
stationary training club.
Reading a book about the East Indies I saw
a reference to a substance called jaggery. Can
you tell me something about it ?— 1459.
It is a coarse brown sugar of the East Indies,
chemically the same as cane-sugar. It is made
by inspissation from the sap of various palms,
such as the jaggery cocoanut, palmyra and date
palms ( Phoenix dactylifera ). The Indian Phoenix
sylvestris and Caryota urens also yield jaggery,
as do the Nipa fruticans, Arenga saccharifera
and others. The sap or juice by fermentation
becomes palm-wine, from which arrack is dis-
tilled.
Method of “fixing” pencil drawings?! find
the ordinary fixatives unsatisfactory.— l23s.
This method is in favor in some Continental
art schools: Add 2|oz. of distilled vinegar to
£oz. of isinglass. Let stand for 24 hours and
then pour in one pint of hot water. Keep the
liquid hot by placing the container in a sauce-
pan of hot water until the isinglass is dissolved.
Filter through clean blotting-paper and mix with
equal parts of rectified spirits of wine. Keep
in a stoppered bottle. The method of applica-
tion is to get someone to hold the drawing
horizontal and face downwards. Paint the fix-
ing fluid rapidly over the back, with a large
flat camel-hair brush. It requires practice to
do this successfully, as enough fixative must be
painted on to penetrate the paper and fix the
pencil, pastel, or charcoal from the back, but
the application must be even or the surface
of the paper may appear stained. Usually two
coats of fixative are necessary, and the drawing
must then be hung by its corners to dry. No
fixatives are perfectly satisfactory; the best thing
is to have a drawing of any value framed as
quickly as possible under glass, and without
fixative being employed.

of fermented and spirituous liquors is in force
in all the States,” says the Commonwealth Year-

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
There were 200 graduates in gown,
hood and mortarboard waiting to receive
their degrees on Saturday. Among them
was Philip Game, who had topped his
year and won the Deas-Thomson scholar-
ship in geology. His parents hurried
home from a country tour to be present
at the ceremony. David and Rosemary
were interested spectators. “Giff” wore
his Air Force uniform.
The Great Hall of the Uni. was
crowded. The sun streamed through the
stained-glass windows, finding the gold
on the Chancellor’s gown. It glanced
off the funny little black tam-like velvet
caps of the Vice-Chancellor and Deputy
Vice-Chancellor, but it lingered on and
intensified the gorgeous reds and blues
in the former’s gown. The ermine on
Dr. Peden’s blue hood made the women
spectators gasp with envy. The Chancel-
lor, the Governor and the Premier spoke.
Afterwards they, the Lud Mayor and
other bigwigs were the guests of Vice-
Chancellor Wallace at lunch in the
Union Refectory.
“Giff,” the Governor’s jolly A.D.C.,
is going to be missed when he leaves
with the Games on the 24th. The Arts
Club spread a lunch for him the other
day. There was laughter when he told
them how he had been described as “a
little fat pommy” by a small boy in the
country when the youngster’s parents
asked who had visited the school with
the Governor. On Saturday the “Snappy
Sydney” group is giving him a party at
Romano’s. He christened this sparkling
revue for them last year when they put
it on for the Crown-street Women’s Hos-
pital. Joe Fallon, who manager-directed
the show, won’t be there ; he’s seeing the
sights of Europe. Enid Baumberg and
Jean Black are organising.
You couldn’t miss Cranbrook the
other night; the drive and lawns were
hung with red, white and blue electrics,
the school’s colors ; balloons hanging in
the hall repeated them. Masses of tawny
chrysanthemums, marigolds and autumn
foliage glorified the lounges. Log fires
comforted the bridge-players. Down-
stairs the dancers wore bare backs with
their trained dresses. Principal of
Cranbrook Iven Mackay’s wife welcomed
all; her frock was all flowers on an
apricot chiffon background. Mrs. John
Maund assisted in black velvets enlivened
with shilling-sized red spots. The new
playing fields benefit.
From the Grosvenor Galleries you
carry away memories of springtime-green
trees and meadows, of summer sunlit
beaches. The show is Gordon Esling’s.
Mrs. Rodney Dangar, who opened it,
was all brown, except for her posy of
autumn berries and leaves. Prince
Molungoo Whennai was one of the most
interested and interesting persons doing
the walls (his portrait in native dress by
Donald Friend brightens up the Lord
Mayor’s room at the civic stronghold).
Orchids and strelitzia bloomed in vase
and bowl.
At a meeting of the Smith Family
Health Spreaders, the auxiliary formed
to work for Mt. Arcadia, the Smith hos-
pital at Parramatta, women jumped up
and down, like so many Jacks-in-the-box,
with money-making suggestions. A
Bohemian supper will be a feature of the
bridge evening at the Carlton on July 7,
the first combined effort. Mrs. C. Lloyd
Jones is the president, and her enthusiasm
was so infectious that not once during the
2Uhour sitting did things drag. Her hand-
bag was businesslike, of very pliable
beige maple, with mount and handle in
a darker shade of the same wood ; it
looked as though nothing would make
it bulge out of. shape, not even if she
had to tuck into it all the cheques that
will eventually make up the required
£3OOO or thereabouts. Mrs. R. T. Ball
is the secretary.
Families linked arms at the opening of
the ice-skating season and glided more
or less nimbly round the “Glassy.” More
family parties sat on chairs and watched
them enviously. Children and youths
darted hither and thither ; girls skimmed
the ice as gracefully as birds. Anything
and everything was worn; the experts
stuck mostly to velvet and the nine-
gored skirt. Mirey Reid gave an
exhibition of figure-skating. This brought
her a basket of autumn glory and the
office many inquiries for lessons.
Glimpsed during the afternoon were
Mrs. T. H. Kelly, with daughter-in-law
Mrs. Tom, Mrs. Stanley O’Connor
(Lynette Clonan who was), the Poynter
lady and Miss Mollie Greenlands.
Already 80 canvases have been pro-
mised for the exhibition of the work of
Australian women artists in the Educa-
tion Building in July. John Young
will be in charge ; on the working com-
mittee are Ailsa Lee Brown, Juanita Job
and Valerie Lazarus. The organisers,
Mrs. A. E. Stephens and Myrtile R.
Innes, hope that all States will be repre-
sented.
The W. E. V. Robsons, of Drayton,
Rose Bay, supplied the floor, the flowers,
the supper and the welcome. The guests
brought good looks, good dressing, danc-
ing feet and good spirits. The dance,
for daughter Kathleen, who marries John
Drury on Thursday, was a happy affair.
Mother wore burgundy laces ; Kathleen,
golden spots and a golden bow on her
marine-blue crepes.
Sydney has now a ballet trained in the
tradition of the Russian school. The
influence of the German school has also
made itself felt; in both types of danc-
ing Betty Ainsworth, the subject of this
photograph, appears on the Lightfoot-
Burlakov programmes as one of the star
dancers. Miss Ainsworth created the
part of Roksanda in the ballet of that
name written by Australian composer
Roy Maling. On May 22, at the Savoy,
she will be seen as the leader of the
Bacchantes in “Scheherazade,” the next
ballet to be produced by the Lightfoot-
Burlakov School.
The Bobby Knightly-Burne couple are
receiving congratulations on the arrival
of their first baby. Mrs. Knightly-Burne
(Sylvia Doherty who was) is a niece of
Clarence Murphy, that bright star in the
Independent Theatre firmament. Mother
and babe are at Englewood private hos-
pital, Burwood, to be near the proud
grandparents, the legal C. L. Dohertys of
Ashfield.
On May 23 and 24 the Insurance Musi-
cal and Dramatic Society is staging
“Thumbs Up” at the Savoy. Ray Mc-
Lean is producing; Picton Lakes T.B.
Settlement will benefit.
The Macquarie Galleries are housing
a collection of Daryl Lindsay’s water-
colors. The show will be opened at 3
o’clock to-day by Public Librarian W.
H. Ifould, 0.8. E.
Alison McDougall’s novel, just pub-
lished in London, is called “The Silver
Dog.” The story is about political life
in N. S. Wales.
Grace, younger daughter of the Arch-
deacon Johnstones, of Parramatta, is
sporting a ring on the right finger of the
left hand. It was put there by Trever
Gibson, eldest son of Mrs. W. T. Gibson,
of Hobart (Tas.).
Here is a Dorothy Welding picture of
Bea Hussey-Cooper, whose engagement
to Gordon H. Walker is announced. Bea
lives at Wahroonga ; her parents are the
Commander E. M. Hussey-Coopers. An
aunt is Mrs. Edgar Downes. Gordon’s
family lives in the neighboring suburb
of Turramurra. The wedding takes place
next month, and the name of their future
home is Magunyah, near Cootamundra.
Bea studied dramatic art abroad; her
work and looks in the “Snappy Sydney”
revue led to a professional appearance
in “Listen, Lester.” She is training the
“Black-eyed Susan” ballet of 11 male
Uni. students for their Commem. on
Saturday. Follows a 10-day visit to Mel-
bourne.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly, who is settling in
Sydney again after living for several
years in Florence while her younger son
Carlton was at Eton, caused considerable
relief locally by an announcement which
was wired from Fremantle, and con-
firmed in Sydney, that she meant to do
no more work for charity. The reason
she gave was that vote-hunting politicians
now support the necessitous, and call on
taxpayers like herself to provide the
money. This, of course, is perfectly cor-
rect. Yet charity work remains the most
effective method of getting into the social
limelight, and the struggle to secure and
hold what are known as pet charities is
unrelenting. The longer Mrs. Kelly keeps
to her resolution the better Eastern Sub-
urbs climbers will be pleased. It’s a pity
from another standpoint. She was about
the best woman-organiser Sydney ever
had.
Her present visit is only a flying one.
She won’t take up residence in the Dar-
ling Point villa which husband Bertie is
building till she has made another so-
journ in Florence, where her daughter
Patricia and an Italian husband are liv-
ing. When she returns she proposes to
devote herself to novel-writing. She has
already published a couple of novels,
and a travel book about India, which she
toured in the brave days before the war.
Blanche d’Alpuget, of the “Mirror,”
left by the Makura for Europe by way
of Enzed. Nearly every writing woman
in Sydney waved her good-bye. They
brought her books and flowers; mes-
senger-boys and -girls were similarly
laden, and of telegraph-boys there was
a procession. When the boat moved on
the wharf was carpeted with a network
of rainbow-hued streamers.
The council of the Institute of Jour-
nalists gave Blanche d’Alpuget a farewell
lunch. It was as happy an affair as the
Women Writers’ sherry-drinking held at
Violet Roche’s flat. For this everyone
put in her bit; what was oyer after
paying for the drinks and savories Isabel
Gullett spent on a cigarette case. This
was A 1 quality ; so were the cigarettes
that later filled it.
Westralians in Sydney lunched Strella
Wilson the other day. Strella lived
on the Golden Mile once upon a time,
and that’s where she got the golden
quality of her voice—according to knight
Walter Kingsmill. August Stang and
Mrs. Stang —he is Consul for Norway
in Perth —were among other guests ; so
were Kathleen Goodsall and Gerald
Savory, of the “Fresh Fields” company.
There were golden roses for Mrs. Stang,
pink gladioli for Kathleen and tawny
chrysanthemums for Strella.
The Duke of York unveiled the bust
of Adam Lindsay Gordon in the Poet’s
Corner of Westminster Abbey. He’s in
good company, with Tennyson on his
right, Shakspeare on his left, and near
him Wordsworth and Coleridge. The
Archbishop of Canterbury spoke his
words of praise. The Duchess of York
listened in company with many well-
knowns in the world of literature and art.
Australia’s flag flew from the Abbey
tower. “Advance, Australia Fair” was
sung. Australia has reason to be proud,
for Gordon is the first of the Empire’s
overseas poets to be thus honored.
Dr. Ziele was surrounded by relations
and relations-in-law when the Ormonde
berthed. There were Ijis sister, Mrs.
Harry Russell, who is staying with him at
Ardvorlich ; his niece, Mrs. Moore, her
commander husband and baby Barbara ;
the commander’s sister, Miss Marion
Moore, who is on a sort of walk-in, walk-
opt visit. She returns by the Ormonde
to her post as sister-in-charge of a pri-
vate hospital in London. Commander
Moore has been on exchange service
with the British Navy for four years.
During that time the family has had no
fixed address ; correspondence has been
headed Plymouth, Weymouth and South-
sea, as it was a case of whither the navy
goes, I go, with Mrs. Moore.
“Blue North,” by Henrietta Drake-
Brockman, has just been published by
the Endeavour Press. This ran through
The Bulletin in serial form, as did Mrs.
Drake-Brockman’s “Men Among Pearls”;
both have for background the Westralian
pearl fisheries. For five years she and her
husband, Major Geoffrey Drake-Brock-
man, who was the Westralian Commis-
sioner for the Nor’-West, lived on the
picturesque shores of which she writes.
Rosemary Budge started it. She gave
the first party for Rosemary Game. Rose-
mary’s school friends followed suit. And
while this letter is in the press, the
Rumba competition is being danced at
Ball Green, Turramurra, the home of
Mrs. A. T. Anderson. Brother David is
one of the guests, and all are expected
to try the Rumba after an expert has
shown how it’s done. At the party at
Government House to-night, the same
young and the very young things will
meet and dance again.
Early in the week Mrs. Toby Brown
was busy tea-ing and introducing the
Brisbane Barry Ahearns to Sydney. On
Thursday the whole Brown family, which
means eight children (and a Tresillian
nurse with the new baby), father and
mother packed themselves into the car
and went off to Binalong for the child-
ren’s holidays. School reopens on June
8. On the 9th Mr. and Mrs. Brown go
on the Otranto tour to Rabaul.

Chatter
The honeymoon chosen by the Stanley
Frankenburgs was sauced with the
piquancy of their favorite sport. Having
been made much of at Tudor Court, they
donned riding kit, mounted their hunters
and set off on a leisurely ride to beauti-
ful Berwick. The tail bride was Nancy
Holt. Her wedding garment was of ivory
moire, and she managed her red roses
and old Limerick lace veil without the
assistance of ’maids.
Mrs. A. R. Lempriere and Mrs. W. H.
Taylor have returned from abroad. They
both had married daughters in England
to visit. Mrs. Lempriere was presented
at Court with her daughter, Mrs. Robin
Todhunter; Mrs. Taylor’s sip of royal
hospitality took place at a garden party,
and she made the acquaintance of Ascot
per medium of the Royal Artillery coach.
Even caddies are turning to stare
reverently at Shirley Tolhurst since
her record 78 at Kingston Heath.
Bogey at the long “Heath” course is 80.
Miss K. Donaldson, with whom Miss
Tolhurst played in her remarkable round,
did a 77 on the same course last year,
but the record was disallowed owing to
a temporary tee being in use.
Betty Dyson, daughter of Will, has,
with a co-worker, Edgar Ritchard, won
a contract to design costumes for the
Pageant of Parliament in the Albert Hall.
It means thinking out hundreds of cos-
tumes technically correct in periods from
the twelfth century to the twentieth.
Nancy Syme’s all-white bridal retinue
stepped out of afternoon sunshine to
follow a scarlet-and-white crossbearer and
a purple-clad choir up the aisle of All
Saints’, East St. Kilda. Waiting at the
altar steps was Hamish Macdonald, of
Wantabadgery, Wagga. Very important
were two small page boys, Geoffrey Hag-
gard and Tony Macdougall, in their first
long trousers, white velvet and fussy
shirts. The demure touch about the
bride’s high neckline and long tubular
sleeves synchronised with her ivory
prayer-book, from which fell a trail of
orange-blossom. Floating on a pile of
tulle veil was a panel of rose point lace
attached to a silver bandeau. Short trains
drifted from the sculpture matelasse
gowns worn by Marie Greene, Marjorie
Clarke, Audrey Poolman, Elyne Chauvel,
Betty Shackell and bride’s sister Mar-
garet. Glasses were charged at Gros-
venor, Toorak.
Languages hold no terrors for Mrs.
Carlyle Smythe, whose smile has been
caught by Broothorn. You may have met
her with a compact little typewriter in
one hand and in the other a formidable
book on German shorthand ; for she has
completed translations into three lan-
guages of abo. stories and posted them
to the Junior Red Cross in Paris. Mrs.
Smythe is immersed in the fostering of
international spirit and friendship among
children. For exercise she’s taken to
swimming, and is loud in her praises of
the attendants at the warmed-in-the-water
baths who take such an interest in her
crawl progress. She admits to being a
“failure at golf”-—she will look at the
scenery instead of the ball. Her clubs
are in Vienna, her fur coat in Berlin,
and some pictures are stored in Switzer-
land, so she has a good excuse to go back
to Europe some day. Mrs. Smythe is a
Maorilander, and was educated in
Europe. Her late husband was a writer
of standing.
The many interesting things that hap-
pened at the American Women’s Auxili-
ary party in the Forty Club were not
conducive to good bridge. A succulent
hamper had inside its ruby layers of
crinkled paper a plump turkey and a
bottle of champagne ; it cost the winner
6d. The attractions of a diamond-and-
platinum brooch twinkling on a velvet
cushion and a lacy foundation garment
were emphasised by Mrs. Charles Hart-
man, all in dusty-brick, and Mrs. Stanley
Lindsay, whose smart black suit went
with a grey blouse. Mrs. Walter Finley
of the sparkling brown eyes moved
among the tables in beige knobbly rep.
Mrs. Calvert Hoyt displayed “devils’
food” (who wouldn’t be a devil and feed
on such fare?); candies, pumpkin pies
and doughnuts. A frilly sleeve and
a silver-fox swung together on Mrs.
Norman Pecot’s shoulder. Mrs. J. Clymer
Wore a verandah on her tarn and
hammered nails on her black dress.
American Consul’s wife Mrs. John Dye
(she’s Italian by birth) escorted the Lady
Mayoress into tea, and Mrs. S. J. Prytz
kept an eye on the treasury.
This party was the third annual effort
of Melbourne’s hospitable and generous
American colony for the Children’s Hos-
pital. Its members find time to turn out
neat stitchery on children’s garments, and
never fail to find cars for the transport
of district nurses.
Members of Emerald Country Club got
out of woolly jumpers and into boiled
shirts and spindle heels and drove off for
Tudor Court, Caulfield. Welcomes were
scattered by the associates’ president, Mrs.
T. W. Gunnersen, in a mingling of silver
and pigeon grey, and by the captain,
Mrs. E. Bottomley, in a heady mixture of
scarlet, flung upon mulberry. Club’s
president, A. E. Seller, brought Mrs.
Seller, clad all in oyster color. Mrs. H.
W. Wansley sported a green shoulder-
warmer, and Mrs. H. C. Norman had
spurts of gold upon her sleeves.
After serious thought Dr. A. C. D.
Rivett has refused the offer of the salaried
vice-chancellorship of our university,
and remains chief executive officer of the
C.S.I.R. He’s an old boy of Wesley Col-
lege, was a student at Queen’s, a Rhodes
Scholar and Professor of Chemistry. The
Broothorn profile belongs to Mrs. Rivett,
who has interests in the same direction.
After getting a B.Sc. and also a Diploma
of Education in Melbourne she went to
Germany to study chemistry. She is the
second daughter of a great Australian
who died untimely—Alfred Deakin.
The Thomas Church couple gave a
dance for their daughters Jean and Betty
among tawny chrysanthemums and russet
maple leaves at Grosvenor. Jean’s dress
was a drift of cloudy pink, frilly and
trained ; Betty had a frivolity of flowers
pinned to her white satin shoulder. Nan
Temple-Smith, Mary Lindsay-Smith,
Diana Park-Smith, Dr. M. O. Kent-
Hughes, Chester Hudson, Colin Mc-
Cutcheon and Winton Murdoch were
among those who found the music in-
spiring.
From their Perthshire stronghold—
Rossi Priory, Inchture —come Lady Kin-
naird and her son on a world cruise by
the Ulysses. In Melbourne they were
guests of knight Harry Gullett’s wife.
Lady Kinnaird has a soft wave in her
white hair, an engaging smile and the gift
of ready speech. She’s president of the
Zenana Bible and Medical Council, and
was snapped up by the Melbourne branch
to speak in Scots Church Hall. She’s
also president of the Scottish division of
the Y.W.C.A., and found time to drink
a cup of morning-tea with Y.W.C.A.
officers here.
A log fire blazed cheerily in the wide
open fireplace at the Windsor when the
Toorak St. Vincent’s helpers rallied their
troops to bridge. Mrs. W. G. CroSbie, a
handful of red-and-gold berries pinned
to her black coat, Mrs. Louis Moore
and Mrs. V. Dimelow headed the com-
mittee. To fill up the hole between lun-
cheon and afternoon tea, chocs, and nuts
were pedalled by Isobel Crosbie and a
jade-clad Sylvia Burke. Noticeable
brown blouses with suits were worn by
Mrs. Alfred Fowler (hers went with
coral) and Nancy Graham. Nancy’s ice-
blue skirt had four slits up the hem.
A perky green quill in a little hat
sprouted above Mrs. Bernard Heinze’s
fur coat.
Mickey Mouse fans have been able to
watch their favorite and his pals gyrate
through half a dozen films on the same
programme. One night over 300 seats
were occupied by the Business Girls’
Auxiliary and their friends, a percentage
on sales going to the C. of E. Girls’
Home at Brighton. For 18 months the
auxiliary maintained five children at the
Home ; it has a receipt for £BO, the price
of a playground, and its last lot of Christ-
mas presents included a frock apiece for
41 youngsters. Its funds are mounting
towards a new wing, where five small
girls will be special protegees.
Mary Guthrie, whose home is at
Moorabool, has had a final polish put
to her education in Paris and is to be
presented in June. She has joined Mrs.
Frank Guthrie in London. Mother and
daughter will be back in Melbourne for
the centenary.
Adelaide goes racing:
Many inter-State visitors came to Adelaide
for Cup week. A dash of color here and
there on the opening day at Morphettville was
a relief; the spectacle of hundreds of women
all in black is depressing. The response to the
tea invitations issued by the club was so
great that accommodation was strained. S.A.J.C.
chairman W. B. Carr presided, and Mrs. R.
M. Cudmore was acting-hostess, wearing a
black tailored coat with collar of skunk fur
and a black felt hat. On Cup day Mrs. H. P.
McLachlan was in the position; she was in a
wine-toned ensemble, with skunk fur and felt
hat.
Some Morphettville frocks: Mrs. Angus
Parsons, a navy pebble crepe ensemble, navy
felt hat, mink fur; the Goodman lady, fawn
satin marocain coat and small velvet hat with
stone marten fur; Mrs. F. A. Tennant (her
frocks are always from Paris), royal purple
wind-swept velvet, trimmed with sable, and a
stitched velvet hat to match; the Sowden
lady, a fawn Donegal tweed ensemble, with
three-quarter coat and a small brown felt hat;
Mrs. W. T. Mortlock, a rich wine-toned cloth
tailored coat with a skunk fur collar and a
hat to match.
Green is coming into favor. At Morphett-
ville Mrs. C. L. Jessop was one of several
in green Angora suit, with felt hat to match.
Mrs. J. H. Morish, of King’s Park, enter-
tained a party in the Percy Graingers’ honor
at the Mount Osmond Country Club. Gold
and brown chrysanthemums decorated the
lounge, and the dining-room tables were
arranged with Golden Guinea marigolds and
mauve flowers. Mrs. Morish was a slim figure
in black-ribbed ring velvet, cut on diagonal
lines, and her toque was black and white. Mrs.
Percy Grainger wore a russet-red Angora tweed
ensemble and a close-fitting toque to match.
Mrs. Morish’s sister-in-law, Mrs. Arthur
Nicholls, chose a leaf-brown coat and skirt, a
brown fox fur and brown velour hat.
Sixty-odd of Adelaide’s prettiest girls, mem-
bers of the Junior Emergency Corps of the Vic-
toria League, were the guests at an afternoon
given by Mesdames Kenneth Milne and K.
Cameron Wilson at the Wentworth tearooms.
Mrs. Milne wore a smart grey silk, patterned
in black and red; her toque was of: black
velvet. Mrs. Wilson’s blue frock was figured
in black; she had a black wool de Chine coat,
and her hat was of black velvet. Miss Murray
was in a black ensemble with a mink fur and
a stone marten fur.
Mrs. Lavington Bonython entertained the
committee of the bridge party being organised
in aid of the Unemployed Sales Depot at her
residence, East Terrace. Tea was served in
the dining-room, the table decorated with scarlet
Guernsey lilies. The bridge is to be held at
the Piccadilly on the night of May 28.
Knight Norman Kater, over from Sydney to
be present at the marriage of his son Norman
to Margot, second daughter of Mrs. Clive
Milne, of Somerton, is the guest of Mr. R. T.
Melrose, of Rosebank, Mount Pleasant. As
the future home of Miss Milne will be in
N.S.W., she is being given a number of fare-
well parties by her girl friends.
Cocktail parties are still going strong. On
Cup day Mrs. Andrew Tennant gave one after
the races, and on Thursday Mrs. Albyn Ran-
kine was hostess at a cocktail celebration at
her residence at Millswood.
There was a wonderful attendance when Lord
Mayor Cain, at the Society of Arts rooms,
opened Gwen Barringer’s exhibition of water-
colors. Mrs. Dunstan, acting-Lady Mayoress,
who accompanied her father, wore a
smart black tailored coat and skirj, with a
plaid blouse and a small black Breton felt hat.
Perth follows the gee-gees, too:
The pelts of many a furry beastie went to
protect feminine punters from wind and rain
at the W.A.T.C. course. Colored brollies
brightened the landscape, and shiny water-
proofs helped things along. Mrs. Jack Durack’s
crushed strawberry raincoat was a pleasing
splash of color; a scarlet bag and scarf
nestled against the deep skunk collar of Maude
Mitchell’s black cloth coat; Mrs. Stan Mul-
chay’s heather tweeds were epauletted in crisp
military fashion; Pat Sanderson’s symphony
of gown and gadgets ran to kingfisher blue;
black, flecked with white, landmarked Eileen
Hayes, and navy blues costumed Mrs. Dave
Walsh and Lesley Everett, who topped hers
with a scarlet Balmoral.
Green-tinged autumn leaves drifted across
the snowy whiteness of president Mrs. D. D.
Paton’s chiffons as she received the guests at
the Karrakatta Club May Ball. Vice-presidents
Mrs. John Forrest and Mrs. C. P. Smith stood
by, the former sweeping .a flowing train of
sherry satin warmed with a velvet shoulder
cape, and the latter girt with black georgette,
agog with goffered frills. The v.-r. party
paused on the threshold of the private entrance
while 27 fledglings fluffed their fine feathers
and fluttered by, bowing over debutante posies
in passing. The Mitchell lady’s presentation red
roses were held against trained leaf-green
satins; Mrs. C. L. Mason’s pearly satin glit-
tered with sequins; Elsie Forrest’s china-blue
velvet was wrought with silver lame; Mrs.
E. R. Dobson smiled on her deb. daughter
above radio-wave crepe of Patou pink; Mar-
jorie Lukics’s Russian tunic effect was in blue
and silver.
A couple of hundred town and country folk
drove their cars to St. Paul’s, Northam, fpr
the Clifton-Hughes wedding. Opalescent satin
and silver lame shimmered under Nancy’s Brus-
sels lace veil and a shower of white roses
trembled in the foreground. Aquamarine lame-
corded silk crepe sheathed Judy Hughes and
Muriel Dempster, whose green tulle ’maids’
caps were strewn with pink roses and silver
leaves. Toasts and dancing reverberated at
Muresk College, where thousands of roses
shed their fragrance in the entrance hall, on
the breakfast tables and from festoons across
the Assembly Hall.
The Pleiades Club put on a programme of
entertainment which went straight to the hearts
of the feminine audience. A mannequin parade
was preceded by Grecian eurhythmic move-
ments, arranged by Mrs. Harry Vincent, and the
fashion talk by Mrs. W. H. Taylor found in-
stant appreciation. Dulcie Allen, Beryl Birch-
ley, Flo Broadhurst, Pat Flower, Lesley Everett,
Eileen Noseda and Del Spaven were a fitting
octette to air the enviable gowns before the
black velvet curtains of the dais.
Old Haleians took partners along to the
school to dance away the hours after the boat-
race. Headmaster Buntine piloted his better-
half’s ivory wind-swept crepe; the Old Boys’
president, Magistrate Moseley, had his wife’s
lemon lace and cerise velvet coatee ’neath his
arm; Heather Harford’s taffetas were shot with
gold; Joyce Ruse flecked her black georgettes
with silver; Ruth Robinson was in red velvet
and Peggy Tomlinson’s black chiffon velvets
were corsaged with ivory satin.
Valmai Ross spends her time trousseau-buy-
ing and taking first place at parties. Mrs.
Norman Giles, Madge Williams, Flora and
Jane Bunning and Mrs. Frank Manford varied
their refreshments from cocktails to tea to toast
the bride-elect.
Molly Ick resigned the secretaryship of the
Repertory Club and made her adieus at a
gathering of members in the Club Theatre.
Songs and “Symphonies” (one in two dimen-
sions) preceded the speeches, and Barrie’s
“Rosalind” followed, with Mrs. R. J. Cox,
Marcia Hodges, Mrs. Alan Stubbs and Paul
Hasluck playing the parts.
Tas. has a flying Governor:
He and Lady Clark flew to King Island and
back. It was fair weather, and they enjoyed
themselves so much that they decided on tak-

Lady Clark showed up at the opening of the

the aisle of St. Andrew’s, Campbell Town, as
Mrs. Charles Rockliffe, in white bridal satin,
closely-cut and flaring into a square train. The
embroidered net veil fell from a little cut tulle

As the Wind Blows.
BY E. MARY GURNEY.
BLACK was a huge beast, gaunt but
massive, and immensely muscular.
His mother was a half-breed collie,
long in the coat, with the usual white-
and-tan markings ; but Black was short-
haired. His coat was black and hard
and sleek, and metallically bright.
He had a blunt, pugnacious muzzle,
a rat tail, and , curious, light topaz
eyes, set too closely together, which gave
him a look that was both savage and
cunning. A deceptive look, for, though
he never fawned, he was of a kindly
temperament.
His first and his last masters were
drovers, and the road is hard alike on
man and beast.
Out at all hours in all weathers, often
working from daylight until dark, often
going for hours at a stretch without bite
or sup, man and dog and horse require
to be physically hard, and born to
endurance.
Black’s first master was not a bad sort
in his way. He was not cruel —not wan-
tonly so, as some men are; but there were
times when his beasts had to go empty
that his. bairns might be filled. Times
when Black’s only rations, after a hard
day’s work, were a crust of bread or a
lap or two of stale milk. Morrison
thought a good deal of the gaunt, black
dog, though he never showed it •in
caresses. ... ■ ■
The rest of Morrison’s team were just
ordinary sheep-dogs, too road-worn to
possess a great deal of character. Tim,
the old collie, had at first seemed inclined
to dispute the matter of leadership ; but
when Black came he was already older
than his years with overwork and
underfeeding, and, after the first tenta-
tive resistance, was only too glad to
leave Black in undisputed possession of
the field. Rock, the kelpie leading-dog,
and Bruce, the nondescript little hunt-
away, had never possessed any aspira-
tions towards leadership.
Good wfithin their limitations, they
were keen on their work while it was to
be done; after that they had no in-
terests beyond sleep and food. If the
latter were not forthcoming, they
slept, too disillusioned and weary to seek
it, as Black sought it, in the backyards
of the suburbs where he lived.
At times he even ranged further afield,
and on more than one occasion was
shot at by a farmer whose sheep had
been worried.
Once a pellet scored a long, deep
groove in his ribs, so that the hair, when
it came again, was white. The day after
he was hit a farmer called to see Morri-
son, and together they went to look at
Black where he was tied.
Unconscious of guilt, he faced them
unashamed ; was unabashed when Morri-
son led him on the chain out of the
town and back to where he had been
hit. There Morrison beat him with a
brutal savagery of which the man himself
was quite unconscious. Brutality en-
gendered of fear, than which is no more
damnable master. For, if he, Morrison,
had not been struggling against almost
overwhelming • odds to keep his head
above water,, if the farmer had not been
a kindly and just man, Black’s life had
been forfeit then.
That beating rankled, for Black was
unconscious of guilt. All his instinct
was to fight, back, but Morrison dragged
him up to the fence, hung him by the
neck from, a post, and there belabored
him with , a mistaken sense of justice
untempered by mercy.
-'Black, though serving loyally still,
never forgave the man for it. Yet
when Morrison’s horse stumbled at
a ford in the high back country
and fell on him, pinning him under
water and drowning him, it was
Black who stayed beside him for the
two days that .elapsed before he was
found ; Black who kept the forty head
of. polled steers that Morrison had been
droving at the time together on the wide
stretch of shingle, river-bed, from which
they would' ’ otherwise have strayed, to
become- hopelessly. lost.
Black became the property of another
drover- —old- Matt Harrison, who was a
kindly old soul when sober, which was
seldom, and a devil when drunk.
Though Harrison beat his horses and
his. dogs when drunk, drunk or sober
he kept them fed. In his keeping, Black,
now rising six, grew into a colossus of a
dog. Nothing could make him fat, but
regular feeding seemed to increase his
already abnormal muscular develop-
ment ; so that, though he was not huge in
the way a Great Dane or a mastiff is
huge, there was something almost terri-
fying in his appearance.
To his new master Black was faith-
ful but aloof. This attitude, when he
was sober, Harrison admired and re-
spected ; but when he was drunk he was
God, and it enraged him that so poor
a thing as a dog should refuse to worship
him. Yet for some inscrutable reason
he refrained from abusing Black;
Years passed. Old Matt’s horses died
or were pensioned off. His dogs passed
on to their. doggy paradise ; but Black,
to all outward appearances, ’remained
unchanged. . ... .. • .
Matt’s jobs were few and far between,
for now there was no trusting him.
Time and again the agents, taking pity
on him, would give him a drive, only to
have, their kindness thrown back in their
faces—stock held on the road for days
at a time by Black while his drunken
master lay dead to the world in his tent,
or even under the open sky.
One day in the busy season they
started for the back country with a line
of pedigree Shorthorn cows. If there
had been any other drover available
old Matt would certainly not have got
the job.
Starting away with the cows,' he was
sober for the first time for months —
years, almost. A palsied, blear-eyed old
man, maundering into his dotage ; but,
even so, he knew his job, and all went
well for the first six days.
He took a pack-horse with him,
camping through the night, rising at
dawn, and nursing his charges through
the heat of the day.
On the seventh day, when they camped
close to the ranges, with the tall, barren
hills crowding in all round and the wind
blowing keenly from the white-capped
Southern Alps, disaster overtook them.
Disaster in the shape of a man with a
bottle—bottles, to be correct.
When dawn broke, old Matt, minus most
of his provisions, was lying dead drunk
in his tent; too drunk to hear Black, tied
in the evening, howl with impotence
when at midday the cattle, mad with
thirst, broke out of the holding paddock
and vanished in a wild stampede over
a high hillcrest into the vast unfenced
wilderness of the hills beyond.
It was night before the old man passed
from his drunken torpor into sleep;
bitter dawn before he woke to compara-
tive soberness and the completeness of
his disaster. This, for him, was the end.
There was no blinking it. Miles from
habitation, his stores gone, there was
nothing for him to do but to saddle-up
and return as swiftly as might be on
his tracks.
Standing outside the tent, surveying
with bleared eyes the scene of desolation,
his gaze finally came to rest on Black,
sitting indifferently against the fence;
and over the old man’s face there swept
a look of mingled hope and rage.
If anything on earth could find the miss-
ing herd, Black could. And what had the
miserable brute been doing, anyway, not
to have given him warning of what was
taking place? If he had been awake to
his duty he would have raised bedlam
when the herd broke away....
Staggering slightly, he made his way
over to the dog, loosed him, and began
to drag him back towards the tent, where
his stockwhip lay just inside the fly.
Black, knowing instinctively what was
toward, snarled with sudden savagery,
so that the old man, startled, loosed his
hold.
Black retreated a few steps and waited.
“Devil! ” whispered the old man.
“Devil! Treacherous devil! You’d turn
on me, would you!”
Muttering and mowing, he stooped and
found his whip ; advanced, swinging it
threateningly. “Go and find ’em!” he
shouted, pointing over the hills. “Get
out —an’ don’t come back unless you’re
driving ’em before you! Get out!” •
Step by step, Black retreated up the
hill. As he retreated old Harrison fol-
lowed, getting more and more violent,
until he was advancing at a stumbling
run.
Presently Black, with a snarl, half rage,
half terror of the insane thing that pur-
sued him, turned and loped away up the
hill.
Shaking his fists and muttering, Old
Harrison watched him until he vanished
over the crest.
With no clear conception of what he
was going to do, Black picked his way
through the scree that formed the oppo-
site slope of the hill. The sun was not
yet risen, and from the bottoms of the
valleys a thin mist rose waveringly. The
western faces of the hills were touched
with faint rose light, but all the eastern
slopes were still shrouded in night.

Found in film on
Teeth . . • the germ
of tooth decay
%
Buried beneath an ever-form-
ing film this invisible enemy
attacks enamel and destroys the
part beneath. To fight decay
you must remove film every day.
How to do it safely.
A
m
m

Science has recently determined
beyond all reasonable doubt the
cause of tooth decay. A germ is
guilty, by the forbidding name of
Lactobacillus. This tiny rod-shaped
organism lives in film on teeth. It
feeds on particles of food, and as it
grows it gives off lactic acid which
attacks tooth surfaces. First enamel
is dissolved —then the part beneath.
Finally the nerve is reached, caus-
ing abscess and pain.
What to do
To fight the germs that cause
decay, remove the film in which
they live and multiply. Ordinary
ways of brushing do not remove
it satisfactorily. Film forms con-
stantly and absorbs the stains from
food and smoking.
To remove film is the primary
purpose of the scientific tooth
paste, Pepsodent. During the past
10 years our laboratories have
striven constantly to develop greater
and greater film-removing power.
Recently a new and revolutionary
material was discovered that
offered new advantages in removing
film. It differs radically from any
used in other tooth pastes.
SAFE —Polishes Enamel
This new material stands unique
in removing stubborn film —it
retards the formation of new film
by polishing tooth surfaces so
smoothly that it is difficult for film
to cling. As it polishes enamel to
high brilliance, it gives teeth a new
and sparkling glaze.
The materials in some tooth
pastes are so hard they scratch
enamel. But the new material in
Pepsodent is soft—twice as soft as
the material commonly used in
other dentifrices.
Remember one fact: this new
cleansing and polishing material is
contained in Pepsodent exclusively
—and not in any other tooth paste
on the market. No other can give
you these results and this great
safety. Write for free 10-day tube

On the scree slide which he was
traversing he picked up the scent of the
vanished herd, and for a moment was
half tempted to follow it. But the urge
died before it was half formed. Here,
in the primitive savagery of the hills,
hushed and forlorn before the dawning,
the tie, never very strong, between him and
the humans he served had been broken.
While old Matt Harrison had lived, the
dog had remained faithful ; but the senile,
gibbering thing that had driven him from
the camp out into the desolation of the
hills was not Matt Harrison. Matt Harri-
son, even when drunk, had been master ;
but the thing that had wielded the whip
and mouthed curses had been, not
master, but something lower than a beast,
distorted with rage and fear.
So Black sat on his haunches beside
an overhanging rock and scratched his
neck where the collar irked it and
snuffed inquiringly at the wind. There
was a scent on it; scent of decaying
flesh. Turning back at an angle, awqy
from the line the herd had taken, he
continued his descent.
The sun came up, flushing the bleached
tussock of the hills to a wan crimson and
waking the scraggy merino sheep, who
left their bedding-down places among
the crags and turrets and filled the morn-
ing with their feeble bleatings as they
sought the slopes and ledges where the
scant pasture was most promising. Some
of 'them came on Black where, in a
valley bottom, he feasted on the rotting
carcass of an old ewe which had escaped
the shearing, and, being too weak to pull
herself free, had died when her long wool
became entangled in the thorns of a
stunted matagory bush.
They formed a ring round him, staring
stupidly, with the newly-risen sun, peer-
ing through a scraggy rift, striking ruby
gleams from their silly, limpid eyes.
Some of them stamped and whistled,
but Black, wise in the ways of sheep,
ignored them, even when, encouraged
by his stillness, they crowded up to him,
sniffing at his tail and quarters.
Only when, becoming overbold, one of
them sniffed at his bone did he show
any annoyance ; and that by rising sud-
denly and “wuffing” once in his deep bass.
Startled out of their silly wits, the
mob stampeded away across the loose
scree of the steep hill’s face, where one
lost its footing and hurtled to destruction
over the forty-foot drop at the bottom.
That night Black, who had slept the
day away in the sun, satiated himself on
its battered corpse.
The next day he wandered far, coming,
at eventide, on the main body of the herd
of missing cows.
Gathered about the muddy bottom,
they were waiting with bovine patience
for someone, or something, to take them
to the pasture they were unable, after
three days of wandering, to find for
themselves.
Black wandered among them idly.
They were not in the least disturbed by
his advent, for they remembered the
smell of him, and remembered that he
was harmless as long as they obeyed him.
Some instinct caused him to round
them up and start them back in the
general direction of Harrison’s camp.
It was evening when he started them.
After one or two short-lived rushes,
they went docilely enough; but night
came on them over the second ridge. So
Black left them. Droving at night simply
was not done.
By morning he and they were many
miles apart.
For weeks Black lived a harmless,,
nomadic life, enjoying it immensely. The
hills were full of carcasses of sheep, dead
by starvation or misadventure, so that
there was no food problem to perplex
him. For the first week or two he spent
most of his time eating and sleeping,
for his feet were road-sore, and he was
wearier than he knew from the long years
spent on the road.
The second month of his wanderings
saw him many miles from his starting
point, and deeper than ever in the wild
hills that ran up from the plains and
downs to the high ranges ; and in all
that time he had not encountered a single
member of his own kind or of humanity.
By strange chance, he had missed by
many miles the several scattered home-
steads that must have lain somewhere
along his route.
Then, quite suddenly, he came one
night on the traces of his own kind ;
and a mile further on found the deserted
remains of a rabbiter’s camp.
He lingered round it for many days,
as if hoping that someone, human or
canine, would return to it; then wan-
dered on along the valley until he came
out of it on to a wide, flat space, beyond
which a milky river moved with deceptive
laziness. Across the river were buildings.
Moved by his loneliness, Black loped
across the intervening space and waded
out into the water. It was absolutely
icy, but he cared nothing for that. All
his life he had forded rivers, swimming
where he could not wade; often driving
stock before him, or heading or turning
it as he swam.
But none of the rivers he had pre-
viously crossed were as this river, swirl-
ing silently and treacherously in its hard-
won bed between the silent, resentful
hills.
Its current took him, though he was
a strong swimmer. The dread under-
currents caught at him and dragged
him down, half-drowning him before
they released him, or shot him, reluc-
tantly or spitefully, To the surface. Had
he been an ordinary dog, the limp thing
that it finally flung ashore would have
been lifeless ; but Black was not destined
for so cheap an ending. For some
minutes, bewildered and exhausted, he
lay where he had been cast up. Then he
staggered to his feet.
On a warm patch of sand he rolled
luxuriously, and lay for a long time,
half-dozing, half-unconscious ; and as he
lay there something moved on the hill-
side above him —something that was
neither sheep nor rabbit.
The sun went down, and Black shivered
and sat up, yawning noisily ; and from
the hillside a surprised little yap caught
his attention.
He stood up, stern erect, and sniffed
questingly at the wind.
A warm scent greeted his nostrils —a
dog scent.
Hackles on end with excitement, he
answered with a sound, half-snarl, half-
bay.
Then, in the gathering dusk, he sensed
movement on the hillside; and a few
moments later there was the swift patter
of hurrying paws on the matted sand.
A shadowy form trotted out of the tus-
sock and halted a few feet from him.
Tiptoe with excitement, Black advanced
to meet it. He was overwhelmed by a
sudden rush that culminated in a tempest
of doggy caresses.
Astonished, but not ill-pleased, he
squatted on his haunches and bayed
with excitement, while his new-found
friend gambolled about him deliriously.
She was a little thing—-part collie and
part setter or retriever.
For some time they played about in the
sand ; and then Black remembered the
buildings that had lured him into the
river.
Very sedately, he turned up the river.
Lady, the little yellow bitch, sat down
and barked ; rose and moved off in the
opposite direction. Black held on. Lady
sat down again and howled. Black,
perplexed, paused, and immediately the
little bitch leaped to her feet and moved
off down the river.
Reluctantly, Black followed her.
Half an hour after, the moon rose,
eerie and white on the hilltops. Lady
paused in a deep valley and then moved
cautiously down wind. Black, wondering,
but obeying instinct, emulated her.
They came suddenly on a bunch of
half a dozen merinos, and Lady, moving
with utmost stealth, was close on the
leader before it became aware of her.
As, with a frightened bleat, it sprang
away, she leaped in like lightning, caught
it expertly by the throat and jerked it
over, so that its neck was broken.
Black, surveying the scene with sur-
prise not unmixed with horror, saw her
begin to tear ravenously at the murdered
beast’s flesh.
Once she lifted her head and bared
her bloody teeth in a canine smile of
invitation, but Black, couchant, with
his head resting on his paws, was too
bewildered to accept.
Presently he lifted his head. A faint
breath of air, stirring from her to him,
smelt maddeningly of warm blood and
warm, sweet flesh.
For the second time that night his
hackles rose, and he lifted his lips, bar-
ing his fangs in a soundless snarl. Stiffly
he rose and moved forward. His gait
was no longer the jaunty gait of a dog
about his legitimate business, but the
slinking, stealthy gait of a wolf that has
made its kill.
With his lips still lifted in their sound-
less snarl, he joined the little yellow
bitch.
I Dream of Violets.
I dream of violets in a dusky wood;
Of great adventure and of high romance;
Of love too sweet for words; of all things
good
And beautiful and dear—and know my mother
near.
She comes, like perfume from a wind-blown
rose
In memory’s garden, and my heart grows faint,
Longing to hear her whisper ere she goes,
To see her lovely face, her figure’s slender grace.
A benediction! Lo! the vision grows
Out of the wild plum-blossom, and I stand
Entranced. O restless wind that blows
Among the boughs, be still!
They sway—and sway—and drive my love
away....

Its Own Reward.
BY WALTER E. WYNNE.
PARROT tacked up the hill to the
Crown Jewel with a lift of the feet
suggestive of a man picking his way
amongst staked pits. He was drunk, but
as he weaved along he asserted often
“I’m not! No. Not.”
On the crest of the rise, and abreast
of the shaft, he paused to observe the
swiftly moving black ropes. A skip
flashed into sight and soared aloft. In-
voluntarily, Parrot’s eyes followed the
streak. “Hell! Oh, Hell!” he moaned,
reeling on treacherous feet.
He continued on to the change-room,
and entered as though hurled in by an
impatient management, collapsing ruin-
ously on a seat. “No!” he insisted
loudly.
Nobody noticed him. The men in the
change-room were in a happy frame of
mind. They had collected their pay be-
fore going on afternoon shift, and en-
joyed the prospect of retaining it intact
on their persons for eight long hours
underground. All had changed into
their working clothes.
Their attention was attracted by his
contemptuous flinging of their street-
clothes from the pegs to the floor.
“Here! What the” bellowed the
owner of a striped shirt that had been
tossed into the drainage from the showers.
“Can’t find me does,” said Parrot.
“Blasted nice change-room this is! Go
’way ’n’ leave y’r does, ’n’ come back ’n’
fin’ y’r does gone.”
“There they are, on yer own peg!
There ! Why, he’s paralytic! ”
“ ’M not!”
“No use taking the trouble to change,
Parrot,” said Striped-shirt, wringing water
from the outraged garment, but com-
posed again. “They’ll never let you
below.”
But Parrot, who had temporarily for-
gotten the purpose of change-rooms,
proceeded to strip. As he removed the
last stitch the whistles blew four o’clock.
The exodus was joined by Parrot, naked
and unashamed.
“Hey!” admonished the psychologist
who had sat in the corner. “No use put-
ting on your working clothes, Parrot.
You won’t get a start to-day.”
The men were grouped about the mouth
of the shaft when he reappeared, clothed,
but not in his right mind. He collected
his lamp austerely. With an evil glance
towards the foreman’s office, he joined
the mob waiting to go below.
Six rings Pause Four rings
“Twenty-nine hundred!” bleated the
braceman. Hiccuping explosively, Par-
rot elbowed his way into the cage.
“Full as an egg,” said the braceman
as it began to descend. A convulsive
leap and scramble deposited Parrot, claw-
ing madly, on the lip of the shaft. Only
the instant braking by the driver in the
engine-room saved “him from a three-
thousand-feet drop. He was hauled to
safety.
From his debris-heap of rusty corru-
gated iron, the muffled foreman emerged,
roaring.
“What in hell is the meaning of this?”
“He’s drunk!” answered the braceman.
“Drunk!” echoed Parrot, appalled.
“Drunk!”
The foreman hesitated. Uncomfort-
ably he remembered the last time he had
suspended an employee for being boozed.
On that occasion the delinquent had
miraculously sobered-up from shock, and
had presented such a spectacle of
wronged innocence that the men had
not returned to work for ten days. Cir-
cumspection was the watchword.
“Orright. Get below,” he instructed
curtly.
The cage drew level again, and Parrot
embarked. They sank from sight.
When the raising and lowering of
men was completed for the time, the
braceman waited on the foreman in his
office.
“Next time you fill the cage up with
cot-cases I’m pulling out,” he said. “A
chap’ll be going up for manslaughter.”
“I know,” the foreman agreed. “But
when is a man drunk? Anyho\y, Parrot
doesn’t get tanked once in a blue moon,
and he’ll be O.K. down below. His
mates’ll look after him.... That timber
for the thirty-three is urgent.”
The braceman departed, muttering.
His place was taken by the man in blue
overalls, who kept wiping spotless hands
on snowy cotton waste.
“In future I’ll never move those cages
an inch when they’re full of drunks.
That’s flat! I don’t care if the mine is
hung up a hundred years. I’ll wipe my
hands of the matter.” He wiped his
hands.
“Your bells are ringing!” said the
foreman nastily, and the driver retreated.
Left thus in peace, the foreman spent
a few moments scowling. Coming to a
decision, he rose, grabbed his lamp and
stalked out to the shaft.
“Twenty-nine hundred!” he snapped
to the glum braceman. Five minutes
later he was half a mile underground.
. All was peaceful on th'e plat of the
2900. He smashed his sulky acetylene
lamp against the wall to inspire better
illumination, and set out along the north
drive. A couple of hundred feet in he
met a trucker.
“Did Parrot get down all right?”
“He got down,” answered the other
cautiously. “ ’Sail we could do to keep
him in the cage. Then it took six of us
to get him out. He thought we wanted
to take him inter the Bank of England
stope and murder him. When we did get
him out, he wanted to jump down the
shaft. We just dragged him back, but he
managed to kick Dummy’s lamp down,
and chucked his own after it. Then he
run off somewhere in the dark, an’ it
took us half ’nour to find him. He
thought it was a game an’ kep’ running
ahead of us an’ singing out ‘Barley! ’ ”
“Where’s he to now?”
“In that bit of a crosscut further along.
We left Smiler with him making shadders
on the wall with his hands, and keeping
Parrot amused.”.
The foreman pushed on. He met
Smiler, the shadowgraph exponent, com-
ing out with a loaded truck.
“Whereja leave Parrot?”
“In that bit of a crosscut, asleep. He
dropped off when I made the shadder
of a gargoyle. So I come out to do some
work.”
In the “bit of a crosscut” the foreman
flashed his light east and west; but there
was no sign of Parrot. Oaths issued
from his lips as he continued his search.
A short distance along the north drive
he spied the weak glimmer of a candle.
It revealed Parrot, with his leg cocked
over a timber structure such as surrounds
the mouths of wells.
“Hi!” said the foreman.
“ ’Sail right,” replied Parrot. “They
reckon this winze is ten mile deep. I was
just leanin’ over, droppin’ rocks down,
to see if it is, an’ me pay fell out of me
shirt pocket an’ went down, too. In a
t’bacca tin. Haven’t heard it land yet.”
He listened intently. “Goin’ down to get
my pay,” he wound up with sudden
resolution.
“No, ya not, ya looney! Come offa
that!”
At the touch of the foreman’s hands,
Parrot shed his docility. A swipe that,
had it got home, would have knocked
the other into a deep sleep spun the
swiper sprawling on all fours. The fore-
man jumped on the humped back. “ ’Sis-
tance! Help!” he shouted.
A dozen lights appeared north and
south, seemingly materialising out of the
solid rock. They approached the arena
at speed, arriving in time to see Parrot
rear upright, pawing the air and orating.
The foreman fell from his back like a
saddle-blanket, and in the act of scram-
bling to his feet was leaped on by Parrot,
who, talking wildly, thumped him on the
back of the neck.
The rescuers salvaged their boss, with
much indiscriminate burning of him,
Parrot, and themselves with the naked
flames of their acetylene lamps. Spread-
eagled beneath a dozen of his workmates,
Parrot burst into a storm of weeping,
punctuated with his expressed intentions
of viewing things and people.
“Pinch a worker’s pay and murder
him! He slung my pay down the winze,
and tried to chuck me after it! I’ll see
the union! I’ll see a s’licitor! I’ll see
him in hell!” His yells reverberated
horribly in their rocky confinement.
“Hell! ” repeated the foreman, mas-
saging the nape of his neck and eyeing
uneasily the touchy rock above them.
“He’ll bring the whole level in an’ the
whole mine out if he doesn’t shut up!
I’ll have to go down an’ get his pay. Tell
him I will. Hi, Parrot!” he bawled into
the scrum at the unseen vocalist. “I’ll
get your pay! Shut off your air!”
Whether from exhaustion or reassur-
ance, Parrot shut off his air.
A coil of thin, pliable wire rope was
brought. The foreman made one end
fast to the timber at the mouth of the
winze and the other equally secure about
his own middle. He gave his lamp a
dispirited smack on a log, looked wanly
at the old familiar faces, and was eased
into the depths.
The winze continued as such only for
a few feet down. It then opened up into
an antechamber to the inferno. The
light from the foreman’s lamp was
soaked up by the hideous chasm. On
one side was a vast rill, where a fall
of ground had ended in a great landslide
composed of rocks as big as ’buses ; on
the other was space, filled with the black-
ness of the Pit.
At a hundred feet he would have sig-
nalled “Hoist!” had there been the
means. Shouting was out of the question.
He shut his eyes and gritted his teeth.
Eventually he touched bottom. On
opening his eyes, he found himself astride
a buckled wheelbarrow. Keeping the
rope about him, he dismounted and took
stock. There were two more wheel-
barrows, one end-tipping ore-truck, seven
spawling-hammers, twenty shovels, a
rock-drill machine,* a gun-metal watch,
eight picks, three lamps and a dozen
hats. He had been a humble bogger
himself one time, so he felt a twinge
of sympathetic understanding for the men
who had hurled the mining hardware into
that tomb.
But he had come down to look for
tobacco-tins. A glance about showed him
scores of them. Among them were relics
bearing long-forgotten brands. Of the
first twenty latter-day brands that he
opened, only thirteen held tobacco ; the
others contained watches.
It was not till he had started on his
fourth dozen that he found the pay.
There were a fiver and four singles, all
old-issue notes.
“That’s queer!” he murmured, exam-
ining them. “All old ’uns. An’ the mine
always pays out new stuff. H’m....
P’raps he got a tenner changed down to
Miser’s pub. Yairs, that’d be it.”

At that point, something fell at his
feet. He started so convulsively that his
lamp hissed twice as bright. Trembling,
he looked down at his feet. It was
another tobacco-tin. One of the men
above, leaning over, had lost it. The
foreman’s instinctive upward glance
showed him the star exhibit of that
chamber of horrors.
It was a mighty rock, or rather section
of country, as big as a house, wedged
between the walls of the stope. As he
stared, fascinated, he could have sworn
that it wriggled its 200 tons of mass in
preparation for a leap, and leered at him
with a million unseen eyes. Its apparent
movement was merely the result of
shadows flickering in accord with the
twitching lamp in his shaking hand.
The foreman pulled himself together
sufficiently to wipe his streaming face
and yank heartily on the rope.
It tautened, and he moved on his
upward journey, hearing already the
shouts that would greet sight of his sud-
denly silvered hair.
On top, he leaned against the timber
from exhaustion and relief. Parrot, who
had been silent for a long time, com-
menced chuckling and hiccuping.
“The noodle!” he said. “Fancy him
goin’ down that hell-hole to rik-rik-
recover my pay! He thought I dropped
it down there! An’ —an’ ” —his voice
rose on wings of mirth —“an’ all the
time I done it on beer an’ poker up to
Miser’s. An’ he crawled ten miles down
there thinkin’ he would find it! C’n
unnerstan’ women swallerin’ a yarn like
that, but a man !” His boisterous hilarity
cracked up in a species of whooping-
cough mixed with oaths.
The foreman listened to Parrot’s dis-
closures in a semi-stunned condition. He
recovered on hearing the paroxysm of
coughing and on seeing the covert grins
of the audience.
“May you cough your liver up!” he
snarled. “May you choke to death!”
He cast his lamp violently afar. It
crashed against the rock wall, and sent
forth a six-inch flame of expiation for
past dulness.
“One of you stay by that drunk,” he
ordered. “If he makes any more row,
lay a rock behind his ear —heavy. Plenty
rocks about. Rest o' you get your trucks
movin’.” He walked back along the
drive towards the shaft.
“So you didn’t drop your screw down
the winze!” he muttered, almost benevo-
lently. “Lost it at Miser’s, did you?
Good! I show a nine-quid profit on the
deal. Made a fool of me, eh? Right!
Goin’ to fool the wife with the same
tale, eh? Great! But I’ll run down
home ahead o’ you, Parrot, an’ spill the
beans. There’ll be a reception committee
o’ one waitin’ for you.”
At ten minutes to midnight, when the
first cageloads of men were coming to
the surface, he set out on his pushbike.
The whistles were blowing midnight
when he arrived at Parrot’s home.
Mrs. Parrot was standing at the gate
awaiting her erring spouse—a by no
means sure vigil for wives on pay nights.
The foreman did not dismount, but
clutched the fence and remained in the
saddle like a loquacious postman.
“Oh!” she said nervously. “I thought
it was Jim. Is he—is everything all
right?”
“Yes, he’s alive an’ kickin’. I just come
up to warn you, missus. He’s cornin’
home, an’ he’s goin’ to pitch a fine yarn
about losing his pay down a winze on
the twenty-nine. Don’t take it in. He
done his pay up to Miser’s on beer an’
poker. So make it warm for him.”
“At Miser’s! Oh, Jim, Jim!”
The foreman pushed off and com-
menced pedalling again. Like a post-
man, he came about in a skilful swerve.
“Make it hot for him!” he called back.
He had no desire to linger, for there was
bound to be howling. The Parrot house-
hold —mostly fledglings—could not suffer
the loss of a fortnight’s pay dry-eyed.
Half-way up the street, the foreman
ceased pedalling and slowed down. “Oh,
damn it all! ” he growled, making another
skilful swerve, and going back on his
tracks.
She was still at the gate. There were
tears, too. He could hear them.
“Say, missus,” he mumbled awkwardly.
“F’got to tell you. Found a pay down
that there winze that mighta been
Parrot’s if he’d ’a’ dropped his down
there. Here it is. In a t’bacca-tin.
Dunno who it belongs to. Most likely
the ’riginal owner is underground for
keeps, long ago. Stick to it, an’ don’t
let Parrot know, an’ give him beans for
losing his roll at Miser’s. G’night.”
He swerved a third time, and rode
furiously towards the mine.
In the Same Boat.
BY J. B. BLAIR.
TUPPY GILES whistled cheerfully as
he jumped on the tram outside North
Sydney depot, a conductor’s money-
and-ticket-bag slung over his shoulder. It
was his first shift for six weeks, and with
an increased service it looked as though
it might be permanent.
He was a short, stocky man, with a
chubby face and impudent blue eyes.
Off and on he had been a trammie for
eight years, and he knew most of the
regular routes as well as he knew his
own street —and he’d lived there all his
life.
He turned the destination signs round
to “Chatswood,” opened his bag and ran
his fingers over the tickets —quite good
to feel ’em again after six weeks off.
This was his first trip on any line that
side of the harbor, but he wasn’t wor-
ried. It wouldn’t take him long to get
familiar with the streets and sections.
Tuppy was a philosophical soul. He
believed in taking things as they came.
If he had been placed on a tram and
told it was bound for Camooweal, 872
sections out, he would merely have
grinned knowingly and hoped for the
best. Chatswood frightened him not in
the least. Every track was strange the
first time you worked it. And, besides,
the motorman would know. Tom Gor-
man, the motorman, was a stranger to
him. A regular on the track he sup-
posed—he’d certainly never seen Tom on
the city side.
Unfortunately, Gorman’s thoughts at
that moment were running on similar
lines. He approached Tuppy.
“S’pose you know the line all right?”
Tuppy, all unsuspicious, admitted
ignorance, and expressed the hope that
Gorman would put him right where
necessary; tell him the sections and
streets.
Gorman laughed.
“Put you right? Why, man, I’ve never
been here in my life before. Newcastle’s
my town. I was depending on you.”
“Gosh! Here’s a mess.”
The two stared at each other. Tuppy
was probably the more taken aback.
After all, there would be only a few
places where the motorman could go
astray. They’d get to Chatswood all
right. But his own part wouldn’t be so
simple. He’d have to appear familiar
with the route, when he didn’t know a
single street or stop ; in fact, all he knew
about the line was that the terminus was
three sections off.
Gorman made a suggestion. “We’d
better hop inside and get ’em to change
one of us.”
“Nothing doing,” said Tuppy.
“Why?”
“How long since you had your last
run?”
“A month.”
“Six weeks me, and I’m not going to
risk losing this one. If we go back one
of us’ll probably be dumped. We’ll have
to manage.”
The other recognised the sense of this.
“1 suppose you’re right,” he said. “One
of the fools in the office is to blame, but
we’ll have to stick it out.”
“Good!” answered Tuppy. “Let her
go.”
Gorman grinned dubiously and “let
her go.” The tram rattled along the
street.
It would be plain sailing for the first
mile or so, anyhow.
Presently the tram began to fill up, and
Tuppy’s cheery face became a little
anxious.
“One section, please.”
That was easy enough.
“Two twos.”
Couldn’t go wrong on that either.
“One and a child’s to Wilson-street.”
Tuppy looked doubtful. “How many
sections, madam?”
“One and a child’s to Wilson-street,”.
she snapped.
He fingered his two-section tickets ner-
vously, then noticed she was holding out
threepence.
“Yes, of course, madam,” he replied,
and punched the appropriate tickets.
“One section, please, and put me off
at Thomas-street.”

“Thomas-street? Yes, madam.”
This was going to be a poser, but he
would keep his eyes skinned for that
name.
He caught a glimpse of Gorman, who
was trying to attract his attention. He
went forward.
“There’s a turn-off coming. Which
line do we take?”
Tuppy looked ahead, just in time to
see a Wynyard tram swing to the left.
This was easy.
“Keep straight on,” he directed.
There was no more trouble for a while.
The passengers seemed to be a model
lot ; if they had been hand-picked for
Tuppy’s benefit they could scarcely have
been more satisfactory. They all seemed
to know where they were going, how
many sections they wanted, and where to
alight. Beyond passing a few compul-
sory stops, no damage was done.
Presently, however, there came an
angry cry. “Why didn’t you put me off
at Thomas-street? I’m sure we’re a long
way past it.”
Tuppy looked startled. He had been
keeping a good lookout, but perhaps he
had missed it.
“I don’t think so,” he replied.
A small boy chipped in. “We passed
Thomas-street three stops back.”
Tuppy pulled the cord.
“Oh, Thomas-street,” he said in sur-
prise. “Very sorry, ma’am. I thought you
said Thompson-street.”
The woman stepped down, fuming, and
the tram resumed its journey.
Tuppy was beginning to experience a
sense of adventure. New routes had
never affected him this way before, but
then the motorman had always known
where they were going. This was dif-
ferent. Ho grinned as he thought of the
passengers’ feelings if they discovered
that neither he nor Gorman had ever
been over the track before.
Presently Gorman again signalled
frantically for help. Another junction.
No other trams in sight. Both men were
at a loss. A bank on the corner pro-
claimed itself as “Crow’s Nest Branch,”
but that didn’t help much.
Tuppy, his sense of high adventure
gone, felt inclined to do the sensible
thing and ask the passengers which way
to turn, but he hesitated. You never
knew where you were these days. A
careless report back to the depot and he
might go out. Explanations were some-
times difficult.
“There’s a John —ask him,” urged Gor-
man.
Tuppy jumped down and approached
the policeman on point duty.
“Chatswood! What’s the joke? That
way, of course,” and he jerked his thumb
to the left.
“Thanks.”
So they set off again in the direction
indicated. If it cannot exactly be said
that “there was joy in the ship as she
furrowed the foam,” it can at least be
recorded that no signs of complaint came
from the passengers, who were intent on
books, knitting, newspapers or conver-
sation, and were relying on the tram crew
with the easy confidence that comes of
years of travelling without mishaps.
“Hope there’s no more junctions,” re-
marked Tuppy. “A man feels a mug
having to ask the way.”
“Yes,” replied Gorman. “We ought to
be all right from now on, and coming
back will be easy.”
Everything was going smoothly.
The passenger-list grew, but nothing of
incident happened. At least not for a
while. Then the trouble started.
An elderly gentleman climbed aboard.
“Terminus, please.”
Tuppy punched him a ticket.
“By the way,” remarked the fare, in
that engaging tone usually employed
whpn apprising someone of a mistake —
pleasantly casual, yet conveying a feel-
ing of self-satisfaction at having dis-
covered another’s error. “By the way,
do you know your destination sign is
wrong?”
“What d’you mean?”
“You’ve got ‘Chatswood’ in front.”
“Of course, I have. We’re going to
Chatswood.”
“But I want to go to Lane Cove.”
“Well, this tram goes to Chatswood.
You’d better get out at the next stop.”
He pulled the cord.
The old gentleman wasn’t to be shaken
off as easily as that. “But you’re going
to Lane Cove,” he insisted. “This is the
Lane Cove line. You can’t get to Chats-
wood this way.”
Tuppy’s heart sank. Hitherto he’d
had no suspicion that anything might be
wrong, but now, all of a sudden, he felt
sure of the worst.
The tram stopped.
A passenger hurried along, looking be-
wildered. “I say, I thought this was a
Chatswood tram? Where are we?
What’s the idea?”
Other passengers now looked up from
books and papers and glanced out of
the tram. All began to talk at once.
“Where are we?”
“What’s gone wrong?”
“This is Lane Cove Road.”
“We must have turned off at Crow’s
Nest Junction.”
Tuppy gave in. There was no other
way out. He stated his case and threw
himself into their hands.
Opinion was somewhat divided. The
Lane Cove passengers were in favor of
continuing to the terminus, and then
going to Chatswood afterwards, but the
Chatswoodites considered they had a
prior claim on the services of the caravan.
Tuppy sided with them. He was a
good democrat, and they were in the
majority. He swung the rod around and
Gorman changed ends.
The defeated side alighted, and the lost
tram set off again back to Crow’s Nest.
It was on the wrong line, but, on the
principle that you might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb, they didn’t
worry about that. If they met an out-
ward-bound tram with a better right to
it, they’d have to argue it out.
Fortunately, there was no such
encounter. Crow’s Nest Junction reached
once more, an irate Tuppy and an in-
dignant Gorman deserted their post for
a moment and approached the policeman.
“What the hell d’you mean by send-
ing us on the wrong track? A man ought
to pass you one,” said Tuppy.
The policeman came back with “What
are you doing on the tram if you don’t
know where you’re going? You’ve got
no right to be there. Fancy all those
people trusting their lives to a couple of
coves that don’t know where they’re
taking them to! It’s disgraceful. You
ought to be reported.”
Tuppy blazed back. “Disgraceful be
damned! It’s our first trip on this line,
and we’d have done all right if you hadn’t
put us on the wrong track. As for
reporting, you’re the one that’ll be re-
ported. Playing practical jokes when
you’re supposed to be on duty. What’ll
the super, say about that?”
The other looked alarmed. “Hey,
steady on,” he said. “Who’s playing
practical jokes?”
“You are, of course. I s’pose you’ll
say you never told us that was the way
to Chatswood?”
“Well, p’raps I did. But I never
thought a trammie wouldn’t know the
way. Reckoned you was kiddin me
because I’m new to the district. I only
started here this morning. Which is the
way to Chatswood, anyway?”
Tuppy eyed him doubtfully; then
decided he was telling the truth.
“Well, another time,” he said admonish-
ingly, “when a fellow asks you a civil
question, you give him a civil answer.
And no guessing!”
After some manoeuvring the tram sped
triumphantly on towards Chatswood.
Back at the depot some time later, an
anxious official approached them.
“You’re running late? Have any
trouble?”
The question was addressed to Gor-
man, but Tuppy replied. “Nothing to
write home about.”
“Good! To tell you the truth, I’ve
been a bit worried. I found out after
you’d left that you were both new to
the track. And I was afraid you might
get lost,” he concluded laughingly.
“Oh, we were hung up a bit at Crow’s
Nest, but we got through all right.”
“Right! Well, your next run is to
Lane Cove. You’ll have to get away at
once. Know the track at all?”
Gorman and Tuppy looked at one
another.
“Lane Cove?” said Tuppy. “I’ve
known it all my life.”
Indian Dawn.
Gauze of mist on the fields of grain;
Buffalo come to the stream to drink;
A peacock bugles; the rainbow train
Of his plumage flashed at the day pool’s
brink.
White pigeons close to the palace gates;
An emerald parrot with blossom crest;
An opening door where a beggar waits,
His saffron bowl at his yellow breast.
Soon in the garden the mists will pass
To show you there, with your muted song,
Your sari stained with the dew-dark grass,
Where Krishna fluted the whole night long.
Oh, get you gone by the secret way,
For Krishna’s music has had its hour!
You can dance no more in the blaze of day
With feet that trampled a lotus flower.
QUEENSLAND.

tragic love story of these two young people is unfolded in a well-
sustained atmosphere of suspense, leading to a strongly presented climax.
