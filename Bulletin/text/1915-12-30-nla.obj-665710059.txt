Poems by Rupert Brooke
Peace.
Now God be thanked Who matched at with
Hit hour,
And caught our youth, and wakened ut
from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharp-
ened power,
To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leap-
ing,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and
weary,
Leave the sick hearts that honor could not
move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and
dreary,
And all the little emptiness of lovel
Oh I we, who have known shame, we have
found release there,
Where there’s no ill, no grief, but sleep
has mending,
Naught broken save this body, lost but
breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart’s long
peace there
But only agony, and that has ending ;
And the worst friend and enemy is but
Death.
The Soldier.
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there’s some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made
aware,
Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways
to roam,
A body of England’s, breathing English air,
Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of
home.
And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
Gives somewhere back the thoughts by
England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her
day;
And laughter learnt of friends; and
gentleness,
In hearts at peace, under an English
heaven.
The Cheltekns.
Your hands, my dear, adorable,
Your lips of tenderness —
Oh, I’ve loved you faithfully and well,
Three years, or a bit less.
It ivasn’t a success.
Thank God, that’s done! and I’ll take the
■ road, ... •
Quit of my youth and you,
The Roman road to Wendover
By Tring and Lilly Hoo,
As a free man may do.
For youth goes over, the joys that fly,
The tears that follow fast;
And the dirtiest things we do must lie
Forgotten at the last;
Even Love goes past.
What’s left behind I shall not find,
The splendor and the pain;
The splash of sun, the shouting wind,
And the brave sting of rain,
I may not meet again.
But the years, that take the best away,
Give something in the end;
And a better friend than love have they,
For none to mar or mend,
That have themselves to friend.
I shall desire and I shall find
The best of my desires;
The autumn road, the mellow wind
That soothes the darkening shires,
And laughter, and inn-fires.
White mist about the black hedgerows,
The slumbering 'Midland plain,
The silence where the clover grows.
And the dead leaves in the lane,
Certainly, these remain.
And I shall find some girl perhaps,
And a better one than you,
With eyes as wise, but kindlier,
And lips as soft, but true.
And I daresay she will do.
Retrospect.
In your arms was still delight,
Quiet as a street at night;
And thoughts of you, I do remember,
Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,
Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.
Love, in you, went passing by,
Penetrative, remote, and rare,
Like a bird in the wide air,
And, as the bird, it left no trace
In the heaven of your face.
In your stupidity I found
The sweet hush after a sweet sound.
All about you was the light
That dims the greying end of night;
Desire was the unrisen sun, *
Joy the day not yet begun,
With tree whispering to tree,
Without wind, quietly.
Wisdom slept within your hair,
And long-suffering was there,
And in the flowing of your dress,
Undiscerning tenderness-.
And when you thought, it seemed to me,
Infinitely, and like a sea,
About the slight world you had known
Your vast unconsciousness was thrown ....
it . ' . '" ‘ '
O haven without wave or tide!
Silence, in which all songs have died!
Holy book, where hearts are etill!
And home at length under the hill!
O mother quiet, breasts of peace,
Where love itself would faint and cease!
O infinite deep I never knew,
I would come back, come back to you,
Find you, as a pool unstirred,
Kneel down by you, and never a word,
Lay my head, and nothing said,
In your hands, ungarlanded;
And a long watch you would keep;
And I should sleep, and I should sleep!
From “1914 and Other Poems,” by
Rupert Brooke.
Born, Aug. 3, 1887 —Fellow of King’s,
1913 —Sub-Lieutenant, R.N.Y.R., Sept. 1914
—Antwerp Expedition, Oct., 1914
British Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force, Feb., 1915 —Died in the
Aegean, April 23, 1915: that is
the brief record of Rupert
Brooke, hailed, since b>«
death, as “the greatest poet
of his time.”
But, of course, he hart
to be dead first. English
critics do not risk their
reputations on any-
thing living. A writer
becomes a great poet
only after his post-
mortem. And a dead
poet is not at all
likely to dispute
'the critic-coroner’s
findings. So Rupert
Brooke is quite safe
—and the critics
can say what they
like over his dead
body.
Brooke has pub-
lished two volumes of
poetry, Poems (1911)
and 1914 and Other
Poems ■ (1915) , both
published at 2s. 6d. a
volume, by Sidgwick and
Jackson. From Georgian
Poetry this page has quoted
his remarkable poem, “Heaven,”
as seen from the wet view-point of
a fish. According to a Fortnightly
biographer, Brooke had a happy life. He
was the son of a housemaster at Rugby,
and ‘ there won the school English
Verse Prize. However, he survived it.
At Cambridge he was elected to a fellow-
ship. He visited the South Seas, where-
from he wrote “vivid prose impressions” to
a London paper. When the war happened
he joined the Royal Naval Division, went to
Antwerp and returned, and was subsequently
sent out to the Dardanelles. Last April'he
contracted sunstroke; septicaemia set in, and
he died aboard a French hospital ship and
was buried in the Island of Lemnos, aged
27. This youth so loved by the gods was
graced with an exceptional charm of manner
and beauty of form. Consequently he hated
the merely pretty; “he was in deadly fear
of.. . .winning fame as one more beautiful
poet of beautiful themes, so he ran... .into
violence and coarseness for salvation.” The
Fortnightly, conductor of the post-mortem
finds in Webster and in Donne the main-
springs of Brooke’s poetical attitude to life.
In fact we are told that Brooke is merely a
reincarnation of Donne: the writer of the
article discloses the parallelism of their
work with considerable ingenuity.
If Rupert Brooke was the greatest poet
of Ms time, it was more by his promise than
his performance, despite the beautiful work
enclosed in 1914 and Other Poems; and also
his time has evidently not produced any
great poets. The promise is indubitably
there; but, dying the death he desired, he
left behind but a reputation begun. We may
qualify and correct the praise of Rupert
Brooke by saying that he had all the equip-
ment necessary for becoming the greatest
poet of his time.
His sonnets, despite their wilful irregu-
larity, the octette having often four rimes, are
safe. And his poems have a special claim
on England, where poetic reputations are
made, by their continual Englishness.
Rupert Brooke loved England with a love
greater than he had for the women in his
verse; and hardly a line of his work does
not recall England. In his deliberate exile,
in the Pacific, in Germany, it seems almost
as if he left England in’ order to recall and
remember England. England he loved most
of all; but he loved many other, though
mostly English, tMngs. He gives a delight-
ful list:—
These have I loved:
White plates and cups , clean* gleaming.
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery faery
dust;
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the
strong crust
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of
wood;
.... Then , the cool kindliness of sheets, that
, soon
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male
kiss
Of blankets; grainy wool; live hair that «a
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the
keen
Unimpassioned beauty of a great machine;
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
The good smell of old clothes; and other
such —
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers.
Hair’s fragrance, and the musty reek that
ht/TI/ff 67*8
About dead leaves and last year’s ferns....
And “Grantchester” is nothing but a paean
to his mistress, England. In Berlin (1912)
his nostalgia overpowers him: —
Here tulips bloom as they are told;
Unkempt about those hedges blows
An English unofficial rose;....
God! I will pack, and take a train,
And get me to England once again!....
Ah God! to see the branches stir
Across the moon at Grantchester!....
Say, is there Beauty yet to find?
And Certainty? and Quiet kind?
Deep meadows yet, for to forget
The lies, and truths, and pain?... .oh! yet
Stands the church clock at ten to threef
And is there honey still for tea?
The other strain in Brooke is his con-
tempt of love of women, the disillusion that
RUPERT BROOKE.
comes only to the young. Had he lived, he
would assuredly have been reconciled with
■love. But there it is, in nearly all his
poems:—-
Songs in Song shall disappear;
Instead of Lovers, Love shall be. ...
He wants an end to “all time-entangled
human love.”
But there's wisdom in woman, of 'more than
they have known,
And thoughts go blowing through them, are
wiser than their own,
Or how should my dear one, being ignorant
and young,
Have cried on love so bitterly, with so true
a tongue?
A stanza so exquisite and so true that it de-
serves its certain immortality.
“How could I see you while I kissed
you ?” sums in one lovely line the whole
mystery ©f love. And here is his sorry
conclusion —the absurd but inevitable con-
clusion of youth:—
Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss,
smile;
Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief
goes over;
Love has no habitation but the heart.
Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch
. awhile,
Oling, and are borne into the night apart.
The laugh dies with the lips, “Lovewith
the lover .
But Rupert Brooke, with the pathetic
finality of youth, has summed up and dis-
posed of love in one perversely sad sonnet:
Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,
Where that comes in that shall not go out
again; >
Love sells the proud heart’s citadel to Fate.
They have known shame, who love un-
loved. Even then
When two mouths, thirsty each for each ,
find slaking,
And agony's forgot, and hushed the cry-
ing
Of credulous hearts, in are but
taking
Their own poor dreams within their arms,
and lying
Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost.
Some share that night. But they know,
love grows colder,
Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at
most. .
Astonishment is no more tn hand or
shoulder,
But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss.
All this is love; and all love is but this.
Lying in Lemnos, where he would be
lying, this great lover of Life should be
happy: he has lived greatly and danger-
ously, and given something greater than
poetry to English literature: he has given
his life.

W. A. G. Penlington, Science Tutor of
Auckland Training College (M.L.), writes
Science of Dairying (Macmillan, 2s. 6d.)
a small but comprehensive text-book, well
illustrated, dealing with the whole subject
of the cow and her chief by-product. This
excellent and lucid text-book is designed for
the use of secondary and technical schools,
and its authorship guarantees its applica-
bility to local conditions. In their spare
time our little cow-slaves might derive much
benefit from a study of this volume, and
possibly there is, here and there, a dairy-
farmer who might like to know something
about his own business.
N. T. Times asked 28 leading English and
U.S. authors to choose the six best novels
in the English language. Result: Vanity
Fair, 14 votes; Tom Jones, 11 ; Dgvid
Copperfield, *7; The Scarlet Letter , 7; Rob-
inson Crusoe, 6; Ivanhoe, Lorna Doone, Teas
of the D’Urbervilles and Tristram Shandy,
4 votes apiece.
Six Australian Short-stories
No; not the six best, or even the six most
popular Australian short-stories; for the
polling in this competition was so disap-
pointingly small that its result reflects
merely the view of 28 individuals who took
the trouble to mark their ballot-papers. The
competition was too difficult. A number of
the competitors could not remember the
names of certain stories, the plot of which
remained in their memory; others had not
the published collection of a favorite author’s
stories from which to select the best. The
truth seems that Australians have a short
memory for short-stories, and that few stand
out from the ruck.
Taking the names of the authors men-
tioned, 18 of Henry Lawson’s stories were
named, and his total votes were 29. This
is as it should be. Lawson is easily first in
popularity as a short-story writer. Next to
him was J. Philp, with five stories men-
tioned, and a total of 14 votes! It was
evident that Brisbane was loyal to Philp,
so loyal that two letters, plumping for one
of Philp’s stories, arrived by the same post,
typed in exactly the same words, but signed
by two different names and without address.
This unanimity will be gratifying to J.
Philp. The scrutineer declared one of these
votes informal. Dyson had three stories
mentioned, and altogether seven votes. Pour
of Dorringtoh’s stories were named, his total
votes being six. M. Grover and Jimmie
Pannikin, both with only two stories noted,
gained five votes. Five of M. Forrest’s
stories got one vote apiece. Vance Palmer’s
two stories were responsible for four votes,
and the same total was recorded for three
of James Edmond’s. Randolph Bedford
received one vote for each of four stories,
and Marcus Clarke got three single votes.
The quite unrepresentative poll for speci-
fied stories resulted: —
His Father's Mate, by Henry Lawson, 6.
The Drover's Wife, by Henry Lawson, 6.
The Golden Shanty, by Edward Dyson, 5.
Miss Maloney's Reppitation, by J. A.
Philp, 5, *
Mr. John Young, by J. A. Philp, 5.
Judgment Day, from a Sub-editor's Point
of View, by Montague Grover, 4.
The next stories in order were A. Dorring-
ton’s Cardigan, Vance Palmer’s Father and
Son, and J. Pannikin’s A River Darling
Romeo, each with three votes. Wasn't Reef,
by 1 J. S. Evison, Elder Man's Lane, by
Henry Lawson, The Stinkin ’ Pride of
Harold Daveney, by J. A. Philp, Barrios,
Consul for' Galata, by James Edmond, and
An ; Outback Bairnie, by Jimmie Pannikin
were the only stories to gain two votes.
The winning competitor was T. Sanderson,
New Farm, Brisbane, who managed to pick
four of the winners. His list was J. S.
Evison’s Wasn't Reef, M. Grover’s Judgment
Day, Dorrington’s Cardigan, Dyson’s Golden
Shanty, J. A. Philp’s Miss Malohey's Rep-
pitation, and Lawson’s His Father's Mate.
A. Sinclair, also Brisbane, sent in five of
T. Sanderson’s list, but omitted His Father's
Mate. D. Scanlau, also of Brisbane, con-
fined his selections to three, His Father's
Mate, The Golden Shanty and Mr. John
Young, all of which were in the winning six.
Evidently Brisbane knew what it was about.

The original of The Sentimental Bloke,
which, by the way, is now in its fourth edi-
tion, was a young Australian, a plumber
who plumbed at the Chow-joints in Little
Bourke. Dennis knew him six years
ago, and is ready to take his Great Austra-
lian Blanky that the bloke was sentimental.
The plumber “took up horse-training as a
hobby.” His biographer acknowledges that
his - slang is correctly reported, with, of
course, some additions from other sources
since Dennis lost him. Ves, the sad truth
is that Dennis has lost his sentimental bloke.
Possibly, like his cobber, Ginger Mick, he
may have gone to the war. If not, he ought
to be preserved in the Mitchell Library.
Fighting the Fly Peril, by C. F. Plowman
and W. F. Dearden (Unwin, Is.), is a valu-
able practical handbook about a pest whose
danger is here insufficiently realised. The
best way to cope with this insect-Hun is to
prevent it being hatched, and that can be
easily effected by sprinkling powdered borax
on its usual breeding-ground, the manure-
heap. A significant fact of the fatal danger
of the fly is the appalling mortality from
infantile diarrhoea which, in England, lag*
but a week behind the curve of the great-
est abundance of flies. The instructions are
plainly given.

“There is no need to tell people who
saw me two years ago of the
wonderful results of
Clements
Tonic”
Mrs. Mary Ethel Hoare, wife of the
officer in charge of the Police
Station, Guildford, N.S.W., writes of
her recovery:
Police Station,
Guildford, N.S.W., 2/l/’l5.
CLEMENTS TONIC, LTD.
“My restoration to perfect health has been so wonderful
that I feel that I cannot let this opportunity pass without
letting you know for the benefit of other people the wonderful
results of Clements Tonic.
“For about five years I SUFFERED DREADFULLY FROM
NERVOUS BREAKDOWN and INSOMNIA. The least thing
would send my whole body into a tremble. I would shake all
over.
“I tried medical treatment, but I gradually grew worse.
I could not eat or sleep. I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF
EVER BEING WELL AGAIN, when a friend advised me to
try Clements Tonic.
“There is no need to tell people who saw me two years
ago, and who can see me now, of the wonderful results of
Clements Tonic, for from the first bottle I commenced to get
better, and after I had taken six bottles I WAS RESTORED
TO MY PRESENT STATE OF HEALTH, WHICH IS PERFECT.
“You are at perfect liberty to make what use you think fit
of this, AS I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
CLEMENTS TONIC AND WHAT IT WILL DO FOR THEM.”

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause —and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tinv pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache. rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisonous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
w
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney (rouble you must positively get rid
of tlie cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color—a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief—every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

Summer.
When the blue dampiera’s growing in the
grass along the road, •
And logania scent runs riot through the days;
When the sky’s a royal harebell that is tilted
overhead,
And the torches of the waratah out-blaze;
When the moths flit gold and turquoise
through the saplings tipped with bronze,
And the Christmas bells make sunset in the
bush ;
When the starry-stemmed epacris swings its
censer by the creek,
While a wren spills silver music through
the hush;
When the hills loom misty sapphire and the
paddocks shimmer gold,
And the grape is swelling out with purple
glee;
When the cornfields raise their splendor to
the fierce, barbaric noon
That hangs dazzling-white with passion o’er
the sea;
When the lazy-curling breakers trail their
emerald to the shore,
And the sea holds out its flashing, dimpled
hands,
Saying, “Come. O weary wanderer, taste my
purple depths, green shallows,
Taste the wind a-blowing cool across my
sands” ;
When the burning hills are poppies on the
warm lips of the night,
With her red hair blowing hazy round the
moon,
And the wind lies drunken-drowsy from the
long wine of the heat,
In the shadows where the pale pittosporums
swoon ;
When the days are crystal goblets filled with
honey to the brim,
Yellow honey gathered by some Satyr band,
And the glorious nights are thrilling with a
star-splashed ecstasy—
It is Summer in our vivid Southern land.

The Shearer’s Return.
I’m glad to leave the rumbling coach
And walk the seven miles.
The same trees on the track encroach;
The same birds sing... .There’s no reproach
I’ll have to fear, but smiles.
Nothing has changed... .I’ll take the course
Along the merry creek.
I wonder if the old white horse
Is ploughing yet?....My own remorse
Will make it hard to speak.
“Why did you never write?” she’ll say—
I know she won’t be stern....
I’ve had no luck. An evil day
Has thrown my chances all away ;
And this is my return.
I’ve lived a wild and reckless life.
They’ll laugh at me, and smirk
And say it’s time I took a wife
And settled down, and gave up strife,
For sober, steady work.
And that’s the best. . . .The same blue sky
Is soft above the trees.
The cotton-bush is hanging high ;
I thought she might be passing by
Among the strawberries.
I’ll wait inside the gate....lt’s strange
There’s no one coming out.
There’s something wrong.... And all things
change
Except the silence on the range.
There’s silence all about.

The place is sold, and in decay,
And no one seems to care;
The doors are locked, the boards are grey,
And she is dead, or gone away—
And all the rooms are bare.

Evening Bain.
Cold, grey rain on the land,
And the river trying to shine
Through the plash of the great drops falling.
Sweetheart, give me your hand,
Let me hold it awhile in mine,
For the voice of the night is calling.
It will creep up there through the trees
Till the stems in a pale ghost light
Shine wet through the cold leaves’ dripping.
Sweetheart, the dim hopes tease
My thought in the growing night
And the dark at my heart is sipping.
Was it a bird that cried
Far out in the dusk and the rain
Like the sob of a flying sorrow?
Sweetheart, creep to my side,
For my clenched soul beats in vain
At the fear-barred door of to-morrow.

Peace!
And the soundless ebb on silver sands
Of sundering seas of pain.
If this be Death, there is no hour of dread
In all the little cycle left to love!
So still she lies ! So still!
And like a sunset on her quiet face
The lingering light of love’s last earthly
smile
Makes sweetness of farewell!
So let her be,
Nor mourn with tears, nor vex with any grief
Such peace as, passing, steals the sting from
Death.

To Cheer You in the New Year,
the EDISON Diamond
Disc Phonograph.
You need but to hear the Edison Diamond Disc Phonograph to satisfy yourself as
to its great effectiveness and charm.
Musicians of world-wide fame are emphatic and unanimous in their praises of this
wonderful sound-reproducing instrument.
r ihe tone is natural, clear, sweet and true —for the original music is reproduced—
overtones and all.
Those who have previously marvelled at the music of the phonograph will be
delighted with a sensation in tonal coloring that is as superior to any talking-
machine music previously known, as the actual painting by a master is superior
to the flat photograph of it.
Distinctive features include its strong and powerful motor and sensitive governor,
ensuring evenness in running and proper pitch throughout every reproduction ; but
mechanical details seem strangely out of place in describing this wonderful
instrument; we leave them for your inspection.
The all-important point is that the Edison Diamond Disc appeals to the most
cultured ear.

illustrated and fully descriptive catalog, post free.

ON BURYING THE ALARM CLOCK
AND MISSING THE ’BUS.
The enemy would have been defeated —if. . . .
what? The tale has been told a hundred
times from every frontier —if there had been
enough men to hit him, or enough shells to
blow him up, or more machine guns to cut
him down, or if someone had arrived in time,
and so on through all the varying circum-
stances in France and Flanders and Poland
and Gallipoli and Macedonia and Mesopo-
tamia. And it has all meant the same
thing—that Britain was not ready, and that
preparation for defence had to be undertaken
amidst the agonies of war. From the day a
handful of British soldiers and ill-equipped
French armies were all that stood between
the gigantic power of Germany and victory—
from that moment until the tragic failures in
Gallipoli and Servia gave emphasis to what
had gone before—the moral of it is as old as
Methuselah. The country which permits
itself to go to sleep on the question of defence
is certain to presently pay a terrible price
for its mere existence. Talk about the
brotherhood of man and the beating of
ploughshares into reaping hooks is all very
well in its futile way; but when the noise
drowns the sound of the other fellow
sharpening his cleaver on the grindstone, it
becomes a public danger.
To snivel over the past is useless. Re-
demption never came that way to anyone or
to any nation. But to be deaf to what the
past has to teach, and to close the eyes to
the present, is to go head first to the Devil.
Through doing both of these things the
British people have gone perilously close to
the edge, and because of it Lloyd George’s
picturesque summary that “the footsteps of
the Allies have been dogged by the mocking
spectre of ‘Too Late’ ” hits home like truth.
In the first month of the war it was known
to Europe that if Germany was to be beaten
it could only be after a struggle waged upon
a scale without military or economic parallel.
But in face of the terrible menace confront-
ing them the British people nourished them-
selves on a diet of humbug and the war went
bloodily on in a mist of secrecy, with the
nation’s head jambed in a bucket and the
politicians feebly trying to make up their
minds what to do about it all. The mis-
management of the campaign, with its sordid
record of bungling in equipment and refusal
to grasp the elementary facts of the situa-
tion, was for a time bad enough and led
to horrible losses; yet the worst feature
was the moral cowardice shown by the mili-
tary authorities and the Governments in
fearing to tell the truth to the nation. For
unpreparedness there are many excuses,
many of them honorable and all of them
making greater the infamy of the enemy.
But for the doping of the public, for the
creation of a national fool’s paradise, no
word of palliation can be found. To this
can be traced every one of the disappoint-
ments of the last few months, the tragedies
of Gallipoli and of Servia, the tangle in the
Balkans, the long months of relative impo-
tence in Flanders, the belated appeal for
recruits. For a democracy depending upon
voluntaryism in military service to attempt
to carry on a war in an atmosphere of
“Hush !” and deception is so wildly insane
as to be almost incredible. The very essence
of the voluntary system is that the citizen
shall know sufficient about what is going
on to form a proper conclusion concerning
his own particular duty. Unless he is able
to see that he is wanted, how in the name
of Heaven can he be expected to flock to
the colors or rush to the rescue or otherwise
do what he ought to be doing? If 16
months ago the people in Great Britain and
Australia and Canada had been told what
sort of job they had on hand —if the sources
from which they could have learned had not
been converted into mediums for the distri-
bution of chloroform —they would not to-day,
nearly 18 months after the slaughter
started, be wrangling about where the
men were to come from or be gazing
in agony at idle machines. And 10,000
homes would not at this Christmas have
mourned for heroic sons whose lives have
been thrown away in the attempt to do the
impossible.
* *• * *
Yet it is too late now for only one thing
—to save the lives of those men who have
fallen in the vain efforts to snatch victory
from impossible places. It is not too late
to give those who follow them a better
chance —not too late to fight with the utmost
strength instead of blindly straggling along
the bloodstained way. Nor too late to real-
ise that Victory will not come to us by any
miraculous means, but only through the
decisive defeat of our enemy upon the field
of battle. Speculations upon what may
happen at this point; dependence upon
something that may occur at some unspeci-
fied date in consequence of certain vague
possibilities—these things are shadows,
empty visions. The iron facts are that the
allied nations have achieved no military
advantages; that the last man and the last
shilling are no figures of speech to those
people who would protect their _ lives
and liberties from this German brigand.
Realisation of the colossal character
of the struggle, of the fearful issues
at stake, of what anything short of
victory over the Hun means, has been
of slow growth, because of that fatu-
ous policy of juggling with the truth as
if it were something the people could not
be trusted with. But with even the half-
knowledge that the world lias now, it _is
almost impossible to believe that the British
and Australian people will be able to regard
the old slipshod methods of defence as any
longer patriotic. Had Britain and Aus-
tralia known national service the Hun
would not be in Flanders to-day nor would
the Turk be still grinning above Australian
graves at Anzac. The men who would
prefer to sqe these things; who with the
enemy battering at the door would still
mouth their philosophic formulae; who
would prefer physical defeat to the aban-
donment of discredited social theories —-
these are not the men who should lead us.
It is never too late to mend —nor too early
to make a start.
ON THE BRIDGE OF THE YEARS.
The Bulletin’s tamest prophet sees
pleasant visions: —
The day after to-morrow will launch us into a
date which the universal school-kid will be com-
pelled to remember until the world has grown grey
or taken to the laughter of a second and better
childhood. History has many mile-posts and some
tremendous breaks of gauge; yet viewing the course
of events and the likely turn of the war, it seems
as if 1916 might quite possibly be the biggest year
this planet has known. When the Romans gave the
first month to Jantjs., a god with faces fore and
aft, which enabled him to look both to the past and
the future, they showed some • sort of understanding
of the need of occasionally taking stock of world
progress, andean the light of the past, trying to get
an idea of thg future. In the same way, considering
the extreme likelihood that the war may blow itself
out within the next 12 months, the bridge between
1915 and 1916 seems a good place to stand at mid-
night or some more reasonable hour, in order to do
a little simple prophecy. The world’s biggest crises
often slip past without notice, and men have mis-
taken the trifling event which made no ripple on the
surface for a thing of moment; but about the ending
of this great struggle which has whirled away the
hopes and follies and blind fancies of the nations,
there can be little mistake. If Wilhelm eats the
dirt of defeat in the coming year we may be quite
certain that the date will remain as a landmark
along the road. A new order of things will begin
from the moment the cannons cool.
* * * *
Of course it may be that the Jeremiah who is
now groaning aloud amid the bones of his Christmas
turkey is right, and that the war before it smashes
itself will have thrown the world into chaotic ruin.
It may be that the guns turned so long in unison
on a common foe may be wheeled round and re-
assembled in broken groups, and, as the voices of a
new discord, ’hurl their curses at friend and foe.
It may even 'be that the German will destroy us
while destroying himself. History offers precedent
for all those things. Before the date known as the
First Olympiad Greek civilisation shows a gap of
a couple of centuries without a record; and the
new civilisation which came along after that
carried nothing over from the old except a song or
two and a great burden of myth. Similarly on the
Italian peninsula there were records in stone of
mighty prehistoric peoples of whom historic Rome
knew nothing. Some great war catastrophe—call
it the Dorian invasion or what you will—seems to
have brought Southern Europe to a state of paralysis
from which it slowly recovered deaf and blind to
all the past. On the other hand, a dozen of the
world’s greatest alliances have gone to pieces out of
the quarrels which followed on their united victory,
so that the hopes based upon their unity of thought
and action were pounded into small dust.
The present war, however, differs from all
struggles of which we have knowledge in the
spirit in which its Prussian makers have been
opposed. The Alliance against Germany is really
an alliance against war itself. For this reason it
seems a fair thing to eliminate universal destruction
from the estimate of the future, and take it for
granted that the fall of the Kaiser means at least
a long period of rest and healing for Europe.
* * * *
One of the features of the coming peace is likely
to be a re-adjustment of values and a revival of
belief in the things that count. The ease and
comfort of recent years, together with the piling up
of wealth, have produced all sorts of monstrous
forms and a glitter of tinsel shows that went far
to prevent a straight look and a decent judgment.
The war, crude, primitive, naked for all its
scientific devices and its call on mechanical skill,
will do a lot to clear the view. Death coming
along a corpse at a time, and surrounded by medi-
cal comforts and nodding funeral plumes, did not
disturb the feast to any great extent; but death,
raw, red and bitter, amid the havoc • and ruin of
bursting shells and maddened soldiers, piling pain
upon pain until half the world seems a human
shambles, is another matter altogether. The ease
with which the finest achievements of art and all
the complexities of civil life can be hurled back
into ruin teaches new lessons and gives a new
valuation to the whole scheme of existence. The
meaning of nationhood as a protective association
bound by interests that go deeper than mere name
and language must emerge from the tumult as
strong and simple as it was when the first tribe
stood back to back against the raid of the wild
beasts. When the peace bugle blows truth will have
got a long lead on pleasant falsehood, and every-
body will have taken on a new earnestness of pur-
pose that must count for a good deal. The fakes
and shams that go with statecraft will have their
grip weakened by the knowledge that they hide
international poison, and the plain man in tweed
trousers will want to know without equivocation or
evasion what the person he elects to rule over him,
or whom he tolerates in the job to which the person
has elected himself, is doing with powder-barrel and
matches. In short, when the air is cleared with
women’s tears and the earth washed with men’s
blood, the world will be a cleaner if a poorer place
to live in.
* * * *
Australia is likely to feel the after-war effects
most of all countries. It is true that the chances
of a conflagration any nearer than Egypt or Persia
seem remote; but if our quota of 300,000 men is
actually sent to the places of bloodshed, the reality
of the struggle will have been brought home in a
personal way to practically every citizen ■of the
Commonwealth. Every man of that vast contingent
who returns to the country of his birth or choice
will bring with him a new spirit and a different
outlook upon life; and the result must be in the
nature of national revolution. Historians with a
solid grip upon the realities of life have asserted
that no people has risen to the height of nation-
ality until it has received its baptism of blood.
If the rule is to hold in the case of Australia,
there seems a very decent probability that the year
1916 may in the centuries to come be looked back
to as the year of our beginning, just as the Year
of the City stood for the start of Rome, and the year
1066 is regarded as the foundation, date of the
composite English nation. The scattered settlements
which grew into colonies, and finally, as States,
were federated into the Commonwealth, may fill as
small a part in the story of the future Australia
as the kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy or the
Latin and Sabine tribal unions that amalgamated
to form Rome. The Australian has never yet come
to a knowledge of himself or learned to look things
seriously in the face, and the reason is quite simple.
Australia grew up from childhood in an atmosphere
of comfort and security. The land was of immense
productivity; the seas were open and free; on all
sides the outward veneer of civilisation hid the claw
and fang of the underlying savage. The idea that
nothing very serious could ever happen to disturb
the settled calm of the world took fastr root. All
sorts of shams and humbugs and confidence tricks
were foisted or practised upon the people-; and the
plain man in the tweed trousers took them as part
of the game. It was hardly worth strangling a
politician or tearing out his lying tongue * when
the worst he' was likely to do would not disturb the
even routine of three good meals a day and a little
cash to squander at the end of the week. The
policy of the country might be ruinous, but the
races- and the cricket match were more interesting;
and, after all, Australia was a particularly difficult
country to ruin in any complete sense. So a century
or so was spent in doing nothing in particular, and
with only the glimmerings Of purpose behind . such
efforts as were made. People worked; but nobody
seemed to know the real meaning of work. It was all
part of a big friendly game; but except in rare
intervals of stress the thought that it could be
anything more never touched the national mind.
The end of the war will change all that. The
Australian is learning in common with the rest of
the world that civilisation is a small island in a
raging sea of savagery, on which the peoples who
stand in the front files of progress can only maintain
their place by constant protective toil and' per-
petual vigilance. The year that is about to strike
on the clock of the ages will as likely as not see the
change; and 1916 will then stand for ever on the
calendar as the date at which Australia discovered
the meaning of things.
A NEW USE FOR THE PARSON.
Recently an English bishop lifted up hands
of holy rejoicing because, as a result of
Zeppelin raids and baby-killing campaigns,
the people were coming more readily to
church; and his remarks have found an echo
in all sorts of places where bare pews and
barer collection-plates seemed to indicate
that the parson’s trade was mostly waste of
breath. Never since Peter the Hermit
called the Christian world to sally forth,.in
faith and charity, and tear the whiskers
from the saints of Islam who held the holy
places of Jerusalem, has Europe known such
a revival of religious zeal. Through the
stench and slaughter of the big war prayers
and appeals have been fired at the throne of
God with a persistence which puts into the
shade any other bombardment of which we
have record. Prayers made in Germany—
including some of the “Gott strafe” order —
have been equal in volume and intensity to
those turned out in Loudon and Manchester,
and the spiritual munition factories of all
lands have been working overtime in their
efforts to cope with the demand for some-
thing to throw at the ear of Heaven. Yet
the whole theory and practice of war is
opposed to the Christian idea; and every
shell that flies shrieks defiance of the creed
which, with minor variations, every Euro-
pean nation outside Turkey is supposed to
accept. We are thus face to face with the
remarkable spectacle of religion at boiling
point, while Christianity (which in milder
and less religious times is supposed to be
synonymous with religion) registers mariy
degrees of frost.
* * * *
Dodging the hand-grenades and bombs, and
pushing his inquisitive spectacles into the
haunts of the modern cave-man in the
trenches, the anthropologist may be able to
improve his studies of primal man; for,
where the crude death is ever close and the
cruder fear rubs shoulders with the com-
plexities of a splendid Stoic courage, the
mind of man is apt to get back to the
religious instincts that stirred it when the
human tail was still a vivid memory. The
earliest sources of religion have been a
matter of happy guess or doubtful specula-
tion ; but to-day the guess and speculation
may be verified or cast aside by studying the
examples of man grown primitive through
stress of the re-created primal conditions of
the great war. Cold, heat, hunger, fear,
pain, imminent death, anger and blood-lust
of vengeance are all present as elements out
of which to blend the primal appeal to what-
ever gods there may be ; and in the definite
cry into which that appeal shapes itself the
features of the primitive gods themselves are
revealed. All this is, of course, very inter-
esting from a purely scientific point of
view; but the general interest is deeper in
the fact itself that war, while it calls forth
religious emotion, does so without regard to
the beautiful creeds which have been evolved
by modern man in quiet places, where the
tension of life was more or less fictitious, and
the great strain of older and blacker days
remained as a memory only. The hells
which were gradually being snuffed out or
reduced in temperature by up-to-date theolo-
gians have been relighted by the Kaiser; and
the Christian soldier, who two years ago
frankly accepted the doctrine of universal
goodwill and brotherhood, now, with equal
frankness, admits the need of Sheol,
Gehenna, Tophet and all the rest as places
of permanent residence for the distributors
of poison-gas and the murderers of women
and children. In short, the war has swept
away a mass of sentiment, theory and orna-
ment, and has revealed the heart of Europe
—a heart essentially religious, and calling
upon a god unknown alike to the Christian
Endeavor meeting and the Papal Council.
¥r -X- * *
This failure of modern Christianity has
been due to the fact that the churches
adopted the practice of “Business as Usual.”
Saints have lived and martyrs died, and the
fine thing and the beautiful thing have been
worked out in life and ink in every age;
but the great mass, of the world’s concerns
have never been seriously affected thereby.
As the Ten Commandments never suited tile
pawnbroking profession, so, just as surely,
the Sermon on the Mount never suited the
grocery trade or the process of law. The
feud between God and Mammon is quite
small potatoes compared with the feud
between the Golden Rule and Jerry and
Co., builders and contractors. The church-
men were ever face to face with the paradox
that to create Christian conditions there
must be revolution, and that to create revolu-
tion meant the destruction of essential Chris-
tianity. Clearly it was better to let the
world roll on, as there was no other course
open. And so the “Business as Usual” com-
promise built cathedrals and hymn-books,
and buried its dead and married its living, to
the accompaniment of trade wheels and
cannon thunder; and religion drew farther
and farther away from its nominal creeds.
* * * *
Out of the tremendous shaking up
which the world is now getting a new
use may be found for priest and parson.
Wilhelm himself has shown us the way;
and when he meets the final bump amid the
ruins of his ambition, this may remain as
his final memorial. However criminal the
acts of the German soldiery, however red
with murder and black with abomination the
track of his armies may be, the Kaiser
claims a religious motive through all, and
calls freely upon God to accept the horror as
something achieved in his name. The Ger-
man nation —not merely the Prussian war-
lord and that part of it which is one in
crime and false ambition with its leaders,
but the great rank and file, including scien-
tists, musicians, poets and growers of red
cabbage—shapes its religious view in accord
with the Kaiser’s remarkable devotional
spirit. If religion can thus be made to serve
the ends of that which is least desirable,
there seems no decent reason why it should
not be made to serve other purposes of a
better sort. The parson may thus cease to
be a merely emblematic figure at funerals
and christenings and become a live and
active prophet of the righteousness of pro-
gress. Consider the possibilities of the
thing. Compare the effectiveness of a poli-
tician’s tirade from a suburban balcony, or
a screed set down in printer’s ink, with the
thunderous voice of those who invoke the
power of the Eternal. Out of the chaos of
our own political life we can imagine the
new Isaiah rising with authority and no
lilies of speech pn his tongue to show us
the way in which we should walk. The men
in black, leaving their creeds to be buried
where the war killed them, might cry upon
our laggard statesmen in the name of God
to finish such a vital national work as the
direct railway to the Northern Territory.
They might yoke a deep religious purpose to
the White Australia waggon, and pull us
far out on the clean, straight road. They
might smite HoLMAN-ism to the dust by
making every pulpit tremble to their denun-
ciation Of the ungodly lOU. They might
%>eed-up tariff reform by linking the name
of Providence with every honest attempt to
create industries or increase Customs duties.
They might, in short, do a hundred things
that would make for a general uplift of Aus-
tralian conditions, and do every one of them
in God’s name without a hint of any irrever-
ence or a suggestion of hypocrisy.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
£1,000,000 a Week.
Let the things we don’t know anything or
are not allowed to say anything about go
for a minute, and let us consider the sequence
of events ih a matter we do know something
of and are permitted to mention —the big
military tvaining camp at Liverpool (Syd-
ney)
1. Newspapers carefully muzzled (by Pearce,
chief muzzier, through his deputy-muzzler, Colonel
McCay).
2. Enthusiastic observations by Pearce about the
good work at Liverpool. Also ecstatic paragraphs
ill newspapers.
3. Orchard, M.H.R., makes disparaging remarks
about the system at Liverpool. Is called a liar and
a traitor. Pearce says Orchard is talking rot..
4. Smell from Liverpool detected at the Leeuwin.
5. Pearce appoints a Royal Commission (Justice
Rich, of the High Court).
6. Rich investigates. Loud aroma. Revelations
of chaos. Three cheers for Orchard.
7. Rich reports. Pearce says everything all
right now. Knew all about it before Orchard
spoke.
8. Mess finally cleared up. Pearce personally
inspects the situation and is “Very Pleased.”
9. No one else' pleased. More smell. Riots.
Men out of hand. Desertions. Seizure of railway
trains.
10. State Commandant appeals to men to play
the game.
11. Someone proposes to open a beer garden in
Sydney to assist in getting things tidy.
12. McCay arrives and finds that the whole busi-
ness is rotten and declares that officers and men must
either get on with the job or get out.

This is the brief history of the thing we are
allowed to say a word or two about; and the
people responsible for it all are the people
to whom Australia is entrusting the job of

A Proposal to Make Bricks without
Straw*
The proposal, of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment to establish an institution for scientific
research along industrial lines and to back it
to the tune of half a million suggests a
waking up dn the part of the Ministry to the
fact that Australia wants work and desires
to get at it in the best possible way. Unfor-
tunately the scheme as suggested is of the
long-distance kind that may or may not
bear fruit some years hence. The idea
seems to be to link up the affair with _ the
Universities, and so yoke those institutions
to the wheels of trade. But the Universi-
ties are notoriously slow and painfully con-
servative. If Hughes is in earnest about
'the matter he can get things moving much
more rapidly by means of the tariff. Fifty
or it may be a thousand industries that
require little or no fresh light from scientific
spectacles could be started straight away;
and scores of others that are already started
could be developed to their full possibilities.
The habit of putting second things first
which seems to get its. grip so firmly on men
in office may be a serious check to progress.
If our industries were put on a safe founda-
tion, and our workers were persuaded to get
up into the collar, the scheme would deserve
nothing but applause; but if public money is
to be thrown away on scientific investigation
in connection with industries that must, if
attempted, be crushed by cheap-labor compe-
tition from outside, the cash might as well
be spent in motor trips er beer. Half a
million devoted just now to pushing new
industrial concerns under a decent tariff
would go far to avert the after-the-war
slump,; but as the proposal stands it does
not look hopeful or even cheerful. Ger-
many, by her technical schools and trade
schools and her encouragement of citizens
who devoted their days to producing two
chemical smells where one grew before,
achieved a lot; but the German was caieful
first of all to shut the door tight against
p rej udicial competition.
The Futility of Yelling and Going
without Cash.
Three barrowloads of letters have arrived
lately to ' explain that the multitudinous
strike in Australia is the result of Govern-
ment failure to Iteep down the cost of com-
modities, that rising prices have been equi-
valent to decreasing wages, and that unless
an all-round system of price-fixing is in-
augurated Arbitration is a snare and a delu-
sion. A sentence or two taken at random
from the pile
Vendors of the necessaries of life may strike as
often as they like by raising prices. hellers of
labor mav not, without rendering themselves liable to
legal penalties. There is no reason in the thing.
To call every increase in the price of a com-
modity a strike is simply to misuse words.
Thirty years ago the writer was given a
bag and sixpence every Saturday morning,
and after walking a mile he achieved a leg
of mutton, and the butcher took the coin
thankfully. Next Saturday if he bought
what helped the sheep to stand up it would
cost him about 3s. 6d., and the butcher
would talk about ruin. Is what has hap-
pened in the meantime the result of a con-
spiracy among butchers? Can the difference
between the Gd. and the 3s. 6d. be attributed
to a strike or a series of strikes? In regard
to some things, perhaps many things,
including meat, there may be market
rigging and manipulation. But that
is another sort of curse altogether.
It represents a phase of extortion by
Capitalism awaiting the application of
medicine; but the dose will never be
administered by organised Labor dropping
its tools and forfeiting its pay. No one
imagines that arbitration in regard to wages
and labor conditions is the last word in
social organisation. But it represents a
firm place of foothold for Labor while it
figures out the bigger problem. It was de-
signed and welcomed by men who by bitter
experience had learned the futility of the
strike as a weapon of economic reform. And
it is still a futility and still brings nothing
but economic loss. It diminishes production ;
and the inevitable result of that is not to
cheapen goods but to make them dearer.

The Blushes of a Shopkeeper.
“Copabella’s” confession: —
I’ve been holding Christmas shows for many years,
but this is the poorest one I ever stood behind; and
I groan when I think that mine was once called a
reliable shop. The little provincial Freetrade
“Home” paper that has followed me round the
world for 16 years describes a recent “All-English”
shopping week held in England as a fine exhibition
of what not to buy. Between you and I,
my “All-Allies” show is the same. The
Jap toys are flashy and trashy, the English
ones are stodgy and crude. The crockery
designs would make a pavement artist weep. There
is about as much variety on the drapery side as in
the potato department. Half the usual Christmas
groceries are unprocurable. Everything is villain-
ously dear and painfully ill-assorted. And it’s all
because Germany is off the commercial map.
The elect have groaned over German chromos and
German shoddy fancy-goods and German cheap art,
but at least the things, were saleable —and wonderful
value for the money. Their Imperial and Allied suc-
cessors are neither—and there isn’t any Australian
art and very little Australian manufacture offering
for comparison. One crude toy comprises two scraps
of bent wire, six short lengths of hollow reed (waste
product), and a lin. celluloid ball. It costs 84d.
(to sell, Is.), and has “Made in England” in 75-
point letters on the lid. The Teuton would turn the
same thing out for about 245. a gross, and would
take jolly good care his nation didn’t get the dis-
credit of the inscription on it. Another consists of
a collection of picture scraps and soap-puzzle cards
and pale-pill paint-books. It is called “Miniature
School,” or something, and costs Bid., too. The
Hun would throw this in to advertise his id. boxes
of pencils or his Ifd. spectacles. In dolls a body-
less rag atrocity with a cardboard face costs Is. 9d.
A Bavarian “sleeper,” with real hair, a normal trunk
and thorax, and a complete change of clothes (in-
cluding lingerie), was an ordinary line at Is. lOd.
last year. Poor little Australian baby! Among
all the British and Australian manufacturing fathers
there can’t be found one to make a natural-looking
doll that will stand a human, young-motherly cuddle
without its features wearing off!
English china cups and saucers are hardly procur-
able at Bs. 6d. to 9s. a dozen. German used to be
2s. 9d. to 3s. 3d. Ordinary white-stone dinner-plates
are up from 2s. 9d. to ss. 3d., and scarce at that.
Meanwhile, Australian manufacturers pose heroically
behind a telephone insulator as the oriflamme of Aus-
tralian enterprise in ' porcelain ! Glassware —cake
stands, fruit bowls, sugar basins —are almost a thing
of the past commercially ; and our Australian apothe-
osis in glassware is a Spotswood jam-jar or a beer-
bottle ! In other departments we are selling binder-
twine for bootlaces, puce and bile-green wool for all
purposes, and cement for insect powder.
Yet the local fluffocracy expects to block the
übiquitous German manufacture with a hot-air
society and a rally-cry! Ye gods and little store-
keepers 1 What hope? It can’t be done that way.
We must deliver the goods. And we can’t deliver the
goods unless we work.
The Superfluous Woman.
“llimu” raises a cheer for the downtrodden:
Newspapers, British and Australian, have been
wasting a lot of space over the superfluity of women
after the war. The death toll of the big fight is
certainly heavy, and Europe will have a shortage of
husbands for a few years to come; but to describe
a woman as superfluous because she does not marry
and rear children is to talk arrant blither.. It is
of course quite unnatural that either women or men
should remain unmanned; but, then, all civilisation
is a break away from the natural. It is quite un-
natural to wear clothes, to write verses by electric
light, to drink any liquid except water or possibly
milk, to ride in trams, to sleep in houses, to cut
your hair or shave, to use soap, or do any one of
the ten thousand things which make up the sum
of life. The argument that something ought not to
be because it is opposed to nature is destructive of
the whole fabric of society as we know it to-day. It
may be hard on a woman not to find a permanent
mate, just as it may be hard on a man who takes
an outsize in ugliness to be turned down by every
woman he asks to marry him; but the old maid is a
very blessed institution, and if the war makes more
of her it is unintentionally doing the world a good
turn. The chances are that other wars before this
one did the same thing, and that nine-tenths of the
softer womanly virtues we admire were the'inventions
of the old maid. A mother is instinctively a selfish
proposition, though her selfishness is of the extended
order that includes her own brood even
makes of her offspring a second self more to be
regarded than the special ego that inhabits the
space under her Corsets. - The old maid, on the
other hand —unless, as occasionally happens, she
gets a kink in her nature through disappointment—•
having no children of her own, is inclined to make
the whole human race her family. Timidity and
maiden delicacy keep her from putting her arms
around the entire population, but she mothers just
as much of it as is within..her reach. The mother
gets swelling volumes of praise; but the maiden
aunt, who is the standing jest of ' flat-headed in-
capables, deserves to have a good word spoken for
her. She does more in a quiet way to smooth the
track of common life than any other member of the
human family. To talk about her as superfluous is
about as reasonable as to declare that friends are
no _good because they don’t pay your wages, or that
tobacco is useless because it isn’t recognised as a
nutritive article of diet. If it comes to a question
of superfluity there are any number of superfluous
wives and husbands, but the old maid generally earns
her right to something more than she gets.
Holman’s promise to introduce anti-shout-
ing legislation in N. S. Wales next session
seems to suggest that the pressure from
outside is getting severe and that he may
have to choose between leaving. Bung to
his fate and personally accompanying him
into the great darkness where the tooth-
gnashing is carried on. It may be that the
N.S.W. Premier in giving the promise was
merely sparring for wind and had no more
intention of keeping it than he has of
abolishing the Legislative Council; but in
the state of public opinion it will; be a diffi-
cult promise to break with impunity. On
the other hand, his intention may be to
push the mattter on, give full legislative
effect to the anti-slio.uting idea, and then
allow the law to be evaded by any of the
thousand and one devices which present
themselves. Now, if the promise made
by Holman were that all drinks must be
ordered in writing and absolute silence main-
tained day and night in every drinking bar,
Bung might well regard the outlook
as serious. It is not the desire to treat a
friend so much as the desire to talk with
him over one, two or 28 drinks that is
responsible for the big consumption of
liquor. If silence in the bar were the rule
—a rule to be enforced by heavy penaltties
on the publican as well as the drinker —
only those people who really wanted alcohol
for its own sake would use the pubs at
all. As the brewers and publicans combine
to assure the public that they have no wish
to sell drink except to those who feel they
ueed it, the rule of silence ought to suit
them admirably. Everybody knows that
neither Holman nor the liquor-sellers desire
to push a traffic that is injurious or demora-
lising; and this being so the opportunity is
theirs to secure complete reform that will
silence both the drinker and the no-license
crowd for ever. Then we shall have a new
phrase to describe the bottom profundity of
noiselessness, and “as quiet as a pub on a
thirsty evening” will mean more than the
“silence of the grave.”
♦
Major-General McCay, while doing his sol-
dierly talk to the men at Liverpool camp, is
reported to have said: “I leave out of account
the man who won’t go to the war because of
physical fear—he does not count; but I
object to him staying behind to become the
father of the next generation.” There is an
idea in this that might be added to the
white feathers which our backstairs policy
forces upon the person who won’t wear
khaki. A man of military age and fitness
can’t leave the country, and an increasing
number of firms won’t give him a job in the
country; but his life is still a reasonably
pleasant one, for there is a labor shortage
and he can get a crust somehow. Why not
therefore go the whole pork in the fake com-
pulsion we have adopted in place of the
simple, straightforward thing, and heap
shame upon him by refusing him the right
to marry? There would still be no compul-
sion about enlistment. Further, he
might be denied the privilege of smoking, or
drinking beer, or riding in trams, or attend-
ing theatres. There are all sorts of ways
of reducing his present happiness and still,
of course, putting him under no compulsion
to serve his country. To coerce the so-
called volunteers by surrounding them with
a rope that is dirty in places and rotten in
others, and irritating all the time, is foolish
business. Still, the men must be got; and
if the voluntary system is to go on, the coer-
cive methods ought to be applied with the
necessary violence.

Major Mclnerny, provost-marshal at Mel-
bourne, has had occasion to go into the
subject of costs relating to the soldier-vic-
tims of venereal disease. It appears that,
for each of the men who left Australia with
the A.I.F. and “unfitted themselves” in
Egypt, being presently returned to this coun-
try for treatment, the Commonwealth is £l5O
out of pocket. But, of course, it doesn’t stop
at that. For some cases Australia will be
paying, in one way or another, two or three
generations hence. Yet in Victoria we have
the interesting spectacle of women like Vida
Goldstein calling on others of their sex to
“be on their guard” as to the proposed
State Bill for dealing with venereal disease
among soldiers. The venerable Vida has had
a lot to say on this matter of State control
at various times; but, while she and her
vociferous pals have been quibbling over a
point of women’s alleged rights, they have
quite failed to realise that the rights of the
most valuable and important women are still
being shamefully disregarded by the Vic-
torian health authorities, owing to the
manner in which the infected, unreported
“case” goes irresponsibly into the marriage-
market. When the rights of the community
at large are compared with the “rights”
demanded by the Goldstein sisterhood, it is
easy to see which assortment has the first
claim to legislative attention.
——
WHEN the Customs placed an embargo on
the export of butter it seemed to think it had
done all that mortal man could do in the in-
terests of the Australian consumer. . But
although since the drought broke in Victoria
in May the production of butter has exceeded
the normal consumption, the -wholesale price
still stays at Is. 4d. a lb., whereas at the end
of 1913 it was Ilf d. Tudor’s ultimatum was
that the export would be prohibited until
Australian demands had been satisfied. In
October the producers reported that, having
supplied the requirements of Victoria and
made up the shortage in N. S. Wales and
Bananaland, they had still 200 tons in cool
storage. Representatives of the Vic. co-
operative factories then put it that, with a
surplus on hand and going bad, it was unfair
to any longer forbid export. Tudor inno-
cently agreed, and the result was that the
other day 150 tons of butter were sent out
of the country on the Mooltan. What, the
Customs failed to grasp was that the retailers
had merely sold as much of the stuff as they
were able'to place at the exorbitant price of
Is. Gd. a pound. It was on this basis that
“local requirements were met.” Similarly, if
beer was retailed at 2s. Gd. a pint one brew-
ery out of every 10 now in existence could
satisfv the local demand. The fact of the
matter is that the. local demand for butter
at a reasonable price has not been anything
like met, yet the stuff is again beginning to
accumulate in the cool stores in the hope, of
course, that Tudor will allow other ship-
ments to be sent away so that the pi ice to
Australian consumers may be kept propped
up to the altitude it reached during the
drought. This isn’t a fair thing, and the
Customs may be confidently looked to to
defeat the conspiracy.

The death of Justice Williams, the M.L.
Arbitration Judge who first gave judicial
sanction to the Preference to Unionists idea,
recalls the circumstances and his Honor’s
reasoning. “It is desirable, in the public
interest,” he said, “that there should not be
any strikes. Unionists are prepared to make
a bargain with the public that they will refer
their disputes to arbitration. Non-unionists
are not in a position to make any such bar-
gain. Therefore, to secure industrial peace,
I will award preference, not to unionists
because they are unionists, but to unionists
because they have undertaken not to strike.”
The argument on which Preference to Union-
ists was based thus implied that preference
must go as soon as unionists broke the agree-
ment with the public not to throw the
machinery out of gear. It is as good an
argument now as it was when Joshua
Williams first propounded it, and is the
only logical basis on which the claim can be
made.

Veiled with mists of doubt, but clear ot

Beating elastic thunder from his drums.
The marching music thrills us. Hope aflie
Heaps towards the vision of our hearts

The voices of all years that were before.
The bugle calls of freedom, truth and right.
Blown through the moving ages mid the
Of tumult or the pauses of the fight.

We see the white feet of our promise-year.
New Year, we greet you! Flames shall

And ruin rush as in a headlong flood
Before the mighty armies that must keep
The tryst of death amid a rain of blood.

The Promised Land.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Friends of the Zionist movement who desired to
see Jewish colonies established in Palestine may
well be shocked at the turn of events which have
made Jerusalem a centre of military activity and
the whole country a base for an attack upon the
Suez Canal.
Moses woke on lofty Pisgah, saw the
Promised Land afar,
Heard the hum of many voices and the
railways’ clank and jar,
Saw the Canaanites arising, heard the
tramp of armed feet,
As the ragged files of Turkey swarmed to-
wards Egypt in the heat;
And the patriarchal person with his beard of
ancient snow
Said: “The plague has set towards Egypt
where they knew it long ago.
“Hittites, Hivites, sons of' Anak. Phili-
stines and Jebusites—
There’s the making in the desert of a lot of
handy fights.
Where is Joshua in hiding? Where has
Israel gone to sleep?
Bleat, ye laggards, on your rams’ horns;
there are harvests here to reap!
Rise! The spoil of all the cities waits the
daring deeds you do,
For Kilkenny’s cats are fighting and the
tails remain for you.”
Rolled his voice adown the mountain,
swelled his words along the wind;
Vultures from the high sky peering crooked
a beak the prey to find ;
And the German kept on drilling Philistine
and Jebusite,
While the railway whistle startled David s
city in the night;
But the waste returned no answer to the
word that Moses spake,
And his eager call to battle found no
Hebrew files awake.
Very sadly disappointed was the ancient on
his perch.
Vainly from the lofty mountain did his eye
the landscape search.
Peak, ravine and valley glistened, stretched
afar the costal plain,
Querulous the old lawgiver raised his faded
voice again.
“Up,” he cried, “ye valiant wanderers that
through desert ways I led !
Judah, Ephraim, Dan and Reuben ! Rise,
the vultures must be fed !”
Then a faint, thin sound came stealing
from the sunset lands afar:
“Is it ancient Moses calling to the faithful?
Here we are!
We are keeping strong and healthy dwelling
’neath the triple sign
That the Lombard kindly lent us as the
token of our line.
War is out with all its thunders, skies with
shrieking bolts are rent,
And the straightest road to Canaan is the
road of cent, per cent.
“Do not worry over Salem. Do not fret for
Sharon’s rose.
Let the Gentile drill his legions where the
twisted olive grows,
Let the Jordan wind and welcome, let the
Ivedron fret its bed,
Let the flocks of Bashan whiten like the
snow on Hermon’s head !
We have other things to think of that you
scarce would understand
And from mountain peaks financial we
observe our Promised Land.
“Though you hardly might believe it, all the
spoils of Canaan’s yield
Would not keep our modern armies one short
fortnight in the field.
Solomon, for all his glory, never raked the
shekels in
As we hope to do in London and in Paris
and Berlin;
And the wealth of all the landscape that
from Pisgah’s top you view
Scarce wquld equal Judah’s earnings from a
single IOU.”
Moses heard and slowly murmured in bis
beard of ancient snow,
“Change on change! The fashions alter in
the busy world below.
Canaan seems but small potatoes, earth re-
veals a greater prize ;
But the spirit does not alter —Jacob’s soul
is in their eyes.
Let me rest. The years are heavy and
remembrance seems like toil.
I shall find at every waking Israel’s children
at the spoil!”

The Hopes that Hang on a Guess.
Christmas in the Western trenches was
celebrated with a proper display of fire-
works ; on the Eastern Front the opposing
armies kept mostly to their burrows and
avoided the keener bombardment of winter;
at Salonika the Allied troops made merry
with nuts and raisins and feast and song.
There was no truce, nor thought of truce,
and the German behind his lines was
probably as busy as usual. This is about
the extent of our actual knowledge of the
war for the week. The real position is all
left to conjecture. The military dispositions
of the Allies at Salonika may or may not be
the pivot upon which things now hinge; but
as we do not know those dispositions, and
cannot even guess at the strength of our
forces there, it is impossible to judge. The
Kaiser threatens to march on Egypt, Persia
and India by the direct Constantinople route
without bothering about the settlement of
affairs in Macedonia; but, then, the Kaiser
himself is reported to be under treatment
for cancer of the throat, and any part of his
programme may be altered or postponed. At
the same time news comes through of strife
between Bulgar and German officers in
Servia; and to balance any comfort which
might be derived from this source there is
enough activity on the part of anti-British
politicians in Japan to warrant official assur-
ances that such activity doesn’t amount to
a shipment of Christmas toys in point of
national importance. The year closes with-
out a hint of any decisive movement that
might bi'ing the protracted struggle to a
close. The certainty that Germany cannot
win does not carry with it the least indica-
tion of the manner or time in which Ger-
many can be beaten. The solidarity of the
Allied nations is unshaken; the British fleet
holds the seas with a grip of steel; the
hunger increases somewhat in Berlin; but
the road for further activity on the part of
the enemy is wide open and his grip on Bel-
gium, eastern France and the Balkans will
take a lot of breaking. In England the
general feeling of impatience and dissatisfac-
tion, which grows from day to day, seems a
good omen. The question of compulsory
service has not been set aside by the alleged
success of the Derby scheme, but is more in
evidence than ever, and may be tested by a
general election. Lloyd George, at his tre-
mendous task of keeping the powder mill
going at high pressure, has been meeting and
overcoming labor difficulties. The whole
British nation is nearer the point of being
fully awake than at any time in its history.
The failure of leadership has been conspicu-
ous in the past, and there are no guarantees
for the future; but JoFFREj the amazing
Frenchman with the patience of the Sphinx
and the steady hand of a billiard champion,
has been reading the German mind and ob-
serving the set of the Turkish trousers. The
best hope of the New Year is that the finiA
of the war is at present about one and a
half inches under the crown of Joffre’s
military cap.
The Referenda compromise still goes
bumping along the track. Speaker Madden,
of the Yic. Assembly, last week ruled
that the Surrender of Powers Bill involved
a change in the State Constitution, where-
fore an absolute majority must vote for it
to carry it; and as an absolute majority
didn’t do anything of the kind, the wreckage
was heaved into the corner. Tasmania has
put the Bill away and forgotten all about
it; S. Aus. is going to have another shot at
the job the Council balked at a few weeks
ago; and Ryan, of Bananaland, is looking
hard at the Wide Bay election figures and
wondering whether the time is ripe for get-
ting on with the plebiscite he threatened
when Dodder tossed the Bill out. So far,
N. S. AVales is the only State to swallow the
measure, and no one is feeling either very
much worse or greatly better in consequence.
Incidentally, the movement in favor of going
on with the Referenda, after all, has fallen
down stone-dead and been buried without
benefit of clergy. Ninety-nine people out of
a hundred don’t know what all the fuss was
about —and if they are wise they won’t
want to know. They will save themselves a
lot of trouble if they merely insist upon one
thing—Unification. Germany has made Aus-
tralia one in war. It is for our own com-
mon-sense to now make it one in peace.

Having got “So Long, Letty,” at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney can very well afford to
wait till Easter for its panto. Letitia is a
very summery American trifle with beach
setting, and she transplants excellently to
Sydney. Then, too, an artful management,
with Christmas in mind, has provided some
glittering panto, spectacles with rose-tinted
legs, spangles and electric effects. Eight
athletic beauties flash or wave 16 bare and
shapely limbs right through the first act and
completely bare their pink backs to an
approving world in the second session. The
legs made present writer think of the whir-
ring racing cyclists of years ago, and the
backs sent his thoughts out to the Stadium
where the incomparable Les Darcy was
pounding championships out of Eddie
McGoorty. After such revelations, wrinkling
chorus tights, which have no sheen and
smother the rippling play of powdered
muscle, are as unexciting as a maiden of
.1830. It is highly probable that the bagged
stage-leg will be hopelessly unfashionable
within the next decade.
The plot lasts longer than might be ex-
pected in such an environment, and the
moral that the old familiar girl is best is
stressed till it almost becomes a musical
sermon. Two childless and mutually flirta-
tious American couples, placed side by side
in toy villas facing the audience, laboriously
agree upon an exchange of partners, the
racketty husband getting the smart dresser
who makes her husband eat out of tins, while
the devoted lawn-trimmer, who is sick of the
hasty sardine, takes over the racketty one’s
devoted but dowdy cook, who patters around
miserably in a wrapper while the dinner
spoils and her husband is feeding elsewhere
on cigars and whisky. A rich and ultra-
fashionable aunt who wants to present baby-
clothes and a baby-carriage when there is
no infant available in either household helps
to throw, a lurid light on the modern problem
of restricted population. The situation is
cleared up gradually at too great length, and
the same c 4 ensor who toned the show down
for local consumption might burn off some

more of the dialogue and clear, the ground
for some extra music and ballets. The pro-
duction loses way when the principals are
working out their destinies and rearranging
their marriage-lines.
Connie Ediss (sometime principal comedi-
enne of London Gaiety) meets Australian
audiences for the first time as Grace Miller,
the sentimental, dowdy stay-at-home who
cooks beautifully for the cheery stop-out. It
has taken Connie a long time to get to this
side of the world —the usual penalty of
London popularity. If she had arrived (say)
in 1895 The Bulletin might have been able
to raise more enthusiasm that it can honestly
manage in 1915. The ex-Gaiety favorite now
wears her settled suburbanism almost too
naturally ; but her voice is small and, in
immemorial phrase, “her dancing days are
over.” Australian Dorothy Brunton, as
Letty Robins, the young, flighty neighbor,
seems just right. She has developed lately
in all departments, and confidently takes
charge of the stage of which she used to be
a pretty decoration. Field Fisher and 0. H.
Workman have rather too much to say as
the two husbands ; Alfred Frith grabs a good
first-act chance as an inane, life-saver; Marie
Eaton supplies some infectious hysterics and
ragtime as a stage Spanish lady; and Ethel
Morrison, Paul Plunket and Cecil Bradley
wander gracefully at large. Two incursions
of the dancing Yates pair are amongst the
best things of a bright and irresponsible show
which is finely mounted and costumed, and
lias MacCunn’s orchestra rolling out new rag-
time for Minnie Hooper’s dancing girls.

wear. Harrington Reynolds, the originator
of the part, is still the kindly old priest, but
the remainder of the co. that introduced
“The Rosary” to Sydney over a year ago
seem to have retired on the proceeds of
that visit. If anything, the newcomers give
stronger support to the padre than for-
merly—Ethel Buckley, Hodgson Taylor and
Valentine Sidney in particular qualifying

George Marlow provided two Christmas
surprises at Sydney Adelphi. The first was
the transformation of a dingy cavern into
an up-to-date, compact and artistically deco-
rated playhouse; the other, the surpassing
of all previous Adelphi attainments in the
production of “Dick Whittington.” Like all
pantos., Whittington depends for success
upon spectacular effect, stage novelties and
catchy songs; and though there is very
little that is new in this version, full use
has been made of the commodious Adelphi
stage to supply quantity and quality in
scenery, and permit the entire company to
frolic in its best glad rags without treading
on its own corns. Carrie Moore is a dashing
Dick Whittington, faithfully and untiringly
supported by Eddie McLean as a very
agile Puss, who works off the feline stiff-
ness by executing some furious whirlwind
dances with sister Decima. Dan Thomas
rattles out in great style all the usual non-
sense expected of a Dame, while Harry
Burgess (Martin Spike) and Teddy Stan-
ley (Bowsprit) combine to give further
large helpings of panto, frivols. Of the
many ballets “The* Dance of the Nile
Maidens,” in which tights are discarded for
partial coverings of tiger-skin and leather
jackets, is the most daring and successful.
Dick will continue to be Lord Mayor of the
Adelphi until further orders.

“O’Leary, V.C.,” makes a tremendous
noise at Sydney Royal, but it is almost im-
possible to believe that he was ever at the
war. The Bulletin had a long, steady look
at the supposed hero in Melbourne, and said
he seemed like an artless old bellowdrama
masquerading in the uniform of a modern
warrior in order to make a fraudulent patri-
otic appeal. That verdict must stand. Of
course, the glamorous, shamrocky Allen
Doone makes it appear more than that while
the imitation is actually being reeled off. If
Ireland and the shamrock hadn’t been in ex-
istence when Doone started in business he
would have been compelled to invent them.
And while it is conceivable that Ireland could
have got along without Doone, the fact must
be kept in view that it wasn’t allowed to. It
is also worth noting that no other nation has
been flung in the face of the nations as
Ireland has. Either they lack Doones or
else they are not wells of tinder sintimint at
which Doones can gather and drink. As the
poet has well sung:—
Erin! the tear and the smile in thine eye
Blend like the takings I count on the sly!
But if you happen to come from Ireland,
you take “O’Leary, V.C.” seriously and re-
fuse to see through him.
O’Leary Doone, who is no better and no
worse than he usually is in these quaint and
popular shows, has Miss Edna Keeley as
assistant-in-chief. She supplies the arms in-
to which he falls when he has been Crossed
in war and delivered four Irish songs. Vari-
ous other deserving mimes do their best to
make the play hang together—which, of
course, it doesn’t. But so long as Doone
hangs together this sort of thing will con-
tinue.
** * *
Other shows may coirte to Sydney and
wave, a festive bare leg, but the 1915-16
Tivoli Follies won’t miss a step on that
account. If other shows can shed their
clothes, the Follies can shed more and still
feel confident and ready for less. The ripples
of free advertisement are spreading to the
more remote suburbs, and the deacons who
regularly put out the cat at 10 are longing
to see for themselves how H.M. Vera Pearce
manages to appear in seven changes—some
of them accomplished in two minutes. The
explanations of these and other mysteries
are available at the usual prices.

Branscombe’s Dandies have been chortling,
dancing and making merry for 12 profitable
weeks at the Garden Theatre, Darlinghurst,
and the conspiracy of gaiety gets brighter as
it attains old age. There isn’t*a weak item
on the bill; and you can take your grand-
mother or Professor Jones there with the
same confidence that you take your most
expensive girl. To hear good singing and
humor that isn’t dragged out with a den-
tist’s forceps and watch a clever show while
you sit in the open air and feel the clean
stars above you is something a lot of tired
people find good. This is Sydney’s pioneer
attempt at a theatre to suit Australian con-
ditions, and it is blessed accordingly.

The recollections of John Sandes :
From an old ball programme that has just come
to light among a mass of literary fragments of the
past I And that the fancy-dress ball at which Pat
McCaughan was present as Lafayette was given by
Lord and Lady Brassey, not by Chief Justice Madden
and his wife, as I stated in a recent Inky Way par.
It took place in Cup week, 1897.
I made some pencil notes on that old ball pro-
gramme at the time concerning the varipus charac-
ters, and many well-known personalities leap to life
again in the faded scrawl. Julius Knight was Romeo
in John Madden’s Shakspearian set. There is a
reference to him in the verses which formed the
subject of the ARGUS-McCaugha n libel action:—
An’ the gurls wint wild whin Romeo shmiled
Wid his beautiful tights of fajvn,
But he niver could get near Lafayette
As rendered by Pat McCaughan.
He probably owed his inclusion to the color of his
tights which provided a much-needed rhyme for
McCaughan. The only drop of bitterness in Julius
Knight’s cup of'joy that evening was' the fact that
Fred Fairbairn had the audacity to go to the ball as
Marcus Superbus. Handsome Jim Lilley went as
Hamlet in the same Shakspearian. set. He sailed for
the Boer War afterwards as adjutant to Colonel Tom
Price, and got a Boer bullet through the top of his
skull during the advance on Brandfort. The kindly
Boers picked him up and pift him into their hospital
at Brandfort, where a Boer doctor operated on him.
When the British entered the town after the Boers
had retired they found Jim Lilley lying in bed semi-
conscious with a note from the Boer doctor pinned
to his pillow detailing the treatment that had been
adopted, and commending him to the care of the
British surgeons. Jim Lilley was operated on again,
and 42 spicules of bone were removed from his
brain. He was then sent to London, where' he was
received into a titled lady’s house which had been
turned into a home for convalescent soldiers. A
well-known Melbourne woman came along and found
Jim Lilley and married him. I saw him and spoke to
him afterwards in Melbourne; but he was not the
Jim Lilley who went to the Governor’s fancy-dress
ball as Hamlet. He had faced “the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune’’ since then.
Colonel Bingham as Othello and Mrs. Bingham
as Desdemona were in the same set. Poor “Teddy”
Bingham, who was a universal favorite, is dead long
since; and Mrs. Bingham is married again. Their
Har-wy Hawkins’s wifey wanted twin-beds,
And Signor Monti wanted Har-wy’s wife.
Har-wy thought that they were made-for-sin beds,
That dainty pair of wooden-bolstered twin-beds;
But Har-wy’s wifey said, “This is the life!”
So Blanchey Hawkins went and purchased twin-beds ;
Asleep in one of them she soon was sunk.
There was not room for two inside those thin beds;
So Monti in the other of those twin-beds
Snoozed sweetly with his hat on. (He was drunk.)
When Blanchey waked next morn among the twin-
beds,
And found the Signor there, the things she said!
The poor man hid in baskets and within beds,
Till Har-wy said he’d had enough of twin-beds,
And so they made of them one Double-Bed!

eldest daughter was at that time a very pretty and
very sedate little person, with black-stoekinged legs
and hair down her back. She is now Mrs. Tony
Hordern. Gorgeous Elliott Page, as Anne Boleyn,
was in the Shakspearian set, too. I remember her
well, for I had a dance with her. She wore a blue-
velvet dress, and was a magnificent public spectacle.
Old Brassey himself, I find, was got up to repre-
sent Louis XVI., and Lady Brassey went as Marie
Antoinette. Hampden, then the Governor of N. S.
Wales, portrayed the Due de Brissac; and his
daughter, the Hon. Dorothy Brand, represented the
Princesse de Lamballe —the lady whose head was cut
off by the Paris mob and held up on a pike in front
of the window in the temple where Marie Antoinette
was imprisoned. The Hon. Dorothy Brand after-
wards married Captain Feilding, A.D.C., who came
in for a title. As Lady Dorothy Feilding she has
been doing wonderful “stunts” in Belgium and
Northern France with her motor-ambulance and corps
of doctors and nurses. Several members of A. C.
Maclaren’s English eleven were present at the ball,
including Maclaren himself and A. E. Stoddart and
Ranjitsinghi. Stoddart’s tragic death in England
was reported not long ago. He was broken in health
and hard-up. Ranji. is still going strong as the
Jam of his unpronounceable kingdom in Kashmir, or
thereabouts, where he has been assisting the British
‘Government in conducting the war by sending troops
and equipment.
Jack Fisken, the owner of Wait-a-Bit, went as
Benedict. He became one afterwards. So also did
Gordon Lyon, who went as Pharaoh in a black beard,
white robe and helmet of gold and silver surmounted
by silver buH’s-horns arid topped by a crest of
peacock’s feathers. Gold and silver were of small
account in those days, for Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie
were booming. Old Holled-Smith, the military com-
mandant, must have been an impressive spectacle in
“Watteau dress.” Anyone more unlike a Watteau
shepherd it would have been hard to find. I used to
meet him occasionally stalking about South Yarra
with a couple of fox terriers at his heels. His
invariable remark was: “What the is there for
a man to do in this place ?” Dr. Gresswell,
the chairman of the Board of Public Health, went as
Queen Elizabeth’s Earl of Leicester. He died not
long afterwards of chronic overwork —one of the best
public officers Melbourne ever had. Walter Coldham,
who appeared for the Arijus in the libel action, went
to the ball as Joseph Surface; and Frank Duffy, who
appeared for McCaughan,. went as “a Mauritius boat-
man.” If the Mauritius boatman happened to have
worn pants of fawn he would certainly have been in
the verses himself. Duffy used to write verse in his
youth. His “Dream of Fair Judges” was much
admired. It included a notable reference to
Hodges, J. —who happened to be the Judge in the
McCaughan case. “Rolf Boldrewood” was at the ball
as a “gentleman of the Louis Sieze period”—when
there were more bushrangers than usual in Europe.
The Hunting set included Godfrey Watson, who
died a few years ago. I was just behind him once
when he got a terrible fall from Swordfish at a bad
plase in Albert Miller’s country. He got up and
rode for several miles without knowing in the least
where he was or what he was doing. I always
believe it was that particular fall that settled
him. He never knew what it was to give in. Peace
to his ashes! Blanche Watson, his sister, was also
in the same Hunting set at the ball. She afterwards
married Evvie Ffrench, and helped him to run a
“Wild Australian” show for some time in London.
I heard lately that he was fighting at the Front.
All these reminiscences from a few notes pencilled
on an old ball programme when Queen Victoria was
still alive and the Commonwealth hadn’t been born!

Her Majesty’s is the only Melbourne
theatre where no sort of change is impend-
ing. A Williamson panto, is a long-lived
institution. Even a panto., of course, must
begin to die as soon as it is born, like all
other fleshly things, but the end of “‘Mother
Goose” is afar off. And the more it im-
proves its way of living the more weeks —
not to mention months—the grand annual
will endure. Thus far it remains the same
show that it was on the first night, happiest
in the first act and saddest when the im-
ported comedians are most loquacious. Maud
Fane is still singing about balloons what
time she tickles the baldheads in the stalls
with gentle airbags; and the last turn of
the evening, by the two comedy-bumpers,
continues to set the youngsters in a roar,
especially the perilous finale of it.

At Melbourne Royal they have shunted
“Kick-In” and revived “The Man Who
Stayed at Home” for Christmas week. The
story of the resourceful Christopher who
disguised himself as an egregious ass in
order to euchre the Kaiser’s minions is not
the cleverest of dramas, but it is a much-
needed stimulant to Australia’s jaded sus-
picions, and will keep business brisk at the
Royal until Friday. Moreover, it is a fit
and seasonable preliminary to “Under Fire,”
the war drama which begins on Saturday.
* * * *
At the King’s (Melb.) the career of
“Stop Your Nonsense” will extend to Satur-
day, and on Monday the Beaumont Smith
management will produce “Mum’s the
Word,” with Ethel Dane in the cast. Mean-
while “Seven Little Australians” is being
played every afternoon, and the novelty of
that pleasing kiddie-drama is expected to
make good during the holidays. Not many
plays with false accusations and orthodox
policemen in them have a special interest
for children; “Seven Little Australians
is one of the few. Miss Bobbie (Vera
Spaull), Suds (Cecil Haines) and the rest
of the family at Misrule are live characters ;
also the adult half of the cast is _ good
enough. The play, in four acts, begins at
2.15 p.m., and all right-thinking juveniles
can conscientiously take their parents and
guardians to see it.
At the time of writing the name of the
drama that the New Year has in store for
devotees of Julius Knight at the Princess’s
(Melb.) is not announced. For the present
“The Three Musketeers” is giving J. Super-
bus every reasonable opportunity to be pic-
turesquely heroic.
The Tivoli’s Melbourne bill shed a num-
ber of its old features on Christmas Day.
Barton and Ashley, in a comedy sketch, are
about the brightest of the new features, the
others being Harrison and Jones, also from
U.S.A.; Pintel, the pianist; Billy Ivinnaird,
who smacks of Scawtland; and Mrs. Slap-
offski. El Cleve, the Nolans, the Payolas
and some more people are the same people
they were before.
“The Man Who Found Himself” is the
big Christmas attraction at Hoyt’s Theatres,
Melbourne. The story, which runs to five
reels and is adapted from George Broad-
hurst’s drama, “The Mills of the Gods,” pro-
vides plenty of film space for cinemactor
Robert Warwick, who was recently featured
in the Hoyt version of “Alias Jimmy Valen-
tine.” The other considerable item at Hoyt’s
is “On the Track of Burke and Wills,”
which is an absorbing record of one of the
Francis Birtles journeys towards the warm
heart of Australia.
“TWIN BEDS ,”
AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Signor Monti (John Ardizoni) disrobing.
“I’m Sorry” is the title of a new “revue”
which is reintroducing the Stanhope Co. to
the notice of Melbourne Bijou supporters.
The piece, which occupies the second part
of the bill, is the usual irresponsible ab-
surdity wherein poular turns are repeated
and the chestnut tree is shaken for a shower
of bon mots. In the first half of the pro-
gramme the proceedings are lively with the
warbling of coon singer Wharton and the
festive gymnastics of the Junet party.
Armytage and Hine, late of the Butterflies
Co., also contribute to the general frivolity
with songs and “business” of a humorous
inclination.
Dead in Adelaide, Thomas Farrell, 73,
best known for his hospitality. He was a
mounted trooper under Warburton half a
century ago; and later, until his retirement
from the public service, he entertained
thousands of people at Adelaide’s two gaols,
which in turn he superintended.
“Wealsman”: Please don’t hand jthe
snowy pinion to the Tasmanian Parliament
for having failed to send any of its members
to the Front, or we’ll have to retaliate by
pointing out that the Speck’s is the only
Australian Parliament that has contributed
a highly-valued official to the Great Disturb-
ance—Clerk-Assistant Frank Green, who
sails this week as platoon-sergeant. Ex-
member J. A. Hurst, the fluent Labor son-
in-law of Lands Minister Belton, is in the
thick of the trouble, and at latest had
swapped his sergeant’s stripes for a lieu-
tenancy. Of the 30 members of the Assem-
bly 28 are family men, and of these only
about six, including Whitsitt, are below the
age limit. The two unmarried members are
L. F. Giblin and G. F. Martin. The former,
the heftiest chap in the Assembly, has only
just lately got his arm out of splints, and
may bolt off to fight at any moment.
The latter is the lightest legislator of the
lot, and on appearances would have difficulty
in squeezing past the physical tests. In the
Leg. Council probably only two (Shields, of
Launceston, and Murdoch, of Hobart) are
of military age.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Dumper”: Film rights of Miss Pritch-
ard’s prize novel, “The Pioneers,” have been
bought by an Australian. The picture is to
be produced in Australia by Franklyn Bar-
rett, who has just arrived from England,
and is getting busy at Gosford (N.S.W.).
Barrett was after the Australian film rights
of the book for another party, but was too
late. However, he met the purchaser, found
he was an Australian, and local industry got
it.
Dead in Melbourne, James Harvey
(Moreland), the versatile actor-mimic. He
travelled a lot with the late “Johnny”
Sheridan (“The Widow O’Brien”), and
worked in with the Coghill Bros., the burnt
cork people.
Dear Bulletin, — Please insert the fol-
lowing advt. for me :
Wanted Lively Sparring Partner for controversies
in this column about theatrical matters. Applicants
must be sober, polite, quick on their feet and
able to leave good openings. Can guarantee regular
work for energetic, intelligent partner with the
right patter. (P.S. —I know nothing- about the
stage or its people, but am very dogmatic, and have
a foundry of cast-iron opinions.)
Yours hopefully, O. Nagger.
“Melb”: “Mother Goose” is first-rate in
all save its literary calibre. I want Tallis,
Ward and Meynell to notify that an Aus-
tralian author will be employed for the next
panto. Thank Heaven, none of the good
writers are in Grub-street, but to every one
of them even a humble £250 for a panto,
would be acceptable. Akhurst, in Mel-
bourne, got £lOO. I believe that would be
about the fee of such other writers as
Marcus Clarke, Walch, Finn, Carrington
and Eville, employed in the past. I know
half a dozen Australians as far above Wood
as Shakspeare is above Sheridan Knowles,
with apologies for mentioning Knowles in
the same breath as a mere carpenter.
“Mid-Channel”: “Ho Ho,” after half
quoting (B. 16/12/T5) what is material,
opens a gap in his own contention
big enough to throw a goat through. I said
“with an exception or two, Australians
didn’t care for Australian pieces.” The
exceptions might have been “A Squatter's
Daughter” and “On Our Selection.” Tne
success of the latter was partly because it
ran to popular prices and because it pre-
sented the type of outbacker who stands
agape at the sight of a two-storey brick
house. Its strength was not in the theme of
the play, but in the magnitude of the carica-
ture. The big managements know the pulses
of their public well enough to leave this
sort of business They know they
couldn’t run it at high prices, and therefore,
from their standpoint, are justified in giving
it the glass eye. Only those citizens who
can laugh at a parson fleeing from a broken
egg of many days, or five men with ropes
extracting Dad’s loose tooth, or the love-
making of Dave, get value for their
money. If it were not for incident ’of this
standard there would be no Australian
drama.
Rupert Julian, formerly with J.C.W.,
has done well in the U.S.A. as a flicker
actor. He hails from Auckland ; but at 19
he headed for Australia and stayed 11 years,
mostly in travelling companies. Six years
ago he crossed the Pacific to try his hand at
the shadow game; and to-day he holds an
assured position. His wife, known as Elsie
Wilson, was also with “the firm” in these
parts. She went to Wilson’s Country with
her husband and has also prospered in the
movie business. All of which prompts again
the question, When is this continent going
to get seriously to the job of making and
exporting films instead of exporting the raw
material in the shape of good Australian
actors?
Ashmead Bartlett, who lectures on the
Heroes of Gallipoli and other war matters,
will be here in February under engagement
to the Taits. Recent events will give him
more freedom of speech concerning the valor-
in-vain.
It happened in Adelaide lately, when the
Royal and the Tivoli were presenting Muriel
Starr and Julius Knight respectively in
exactly the same kind of American drama.
Said a pressman to Herbert Myers at the
Royal: “What’s this new Time-payment
play of yours like?” “That isn’t it,” said
Myers; “it’s ‘Bought and Paid For.’ ”
“But isn’t it ‘Paid in Full’?” “No; that’s
at the Tivoli.” “There you are,” said the
newspaper man, “bought and paid for, but
not paid in full. Time-payment system,
obviously.”
“Kaniva”: Blanche Walsh, the Yankee
actress who toured with Nat Goodwin, and
accompanied that persistently-married per-
son to Australia in 1896, died recently at
Cleveland, Ohio (U.S.A.). Queen Eliza-
beth (in “Amy Robsart”), Trilby, La Tosca,
Fedora, Cleopatra, and Katusha (in
“Resurrection”) were among her successes in
Wilson’s country. She was born in New
York in 1873.
(Continued on page 26.)
The Maoriland Journal of Education —
a State paper—has an article on “Some Ad-
vice to Teachers.” Two admonitions :
Communities differ very much. In some, card-
playing and dancing are not considered objection-
able ; in others, the teacher who docs either ruins
her influence in the school.
One appearance in public with a rakish young-
man prejudices an entire community.
Verily, brethren, strait is the gate and nar-
row is the way, and few there be that find it.
How little space is given in the press to
even the most eloquent of persons who are
not in politics or official jobs! In a report
(11/12/T5) of a Melbourne civic reception
to an invalided soldier the Age, after print-
ing some observations by Customs Minister
Frank Tudor and Gaud Mayor Hennessy,
mentions: “Mr. A. Deakin also spoke.”
Wi Pere, one of the brown brethren who
decorate Maoriland’s Leg. Council, started
off for the big korero the other day, after
frequenting Parliament on and off during the
best part of 30 years. Wi was a cheerful
old savage addicted to long periods of tre-
mendous silence and sudden outbursts of
oratory which usually ended in the pakeha
being fiercely consigned to Hell, unon which
the Speaker would remark “Order,” and Wi
resume his seat with a scowl of hate. He
was a chief of the Ngatiporou, and away
back in the ’6o’s went with (he paleface
against the Hauhaus. He generally had a
cold in the head, and concealed himself
behind a large scarf.
Joshua Williams, who died in England a
few days ago, should, perhaps, have been
made C.J. of Maoriland when Prendergast
retired. His colleagues on the Bench
thought so, anyhow; but Seddon had other
plans, and Stout went up. Williams only
once made a serious judicial bloomer, and
that was during the involved litigation re-
garding the liquidation of the Colonial Bank,
when he permitted his tongue to run away
with his head for a couple of seconds and
make some unjust remarks about Joe Ward.
This incident for years stood between Wil-
liams and the handle he wanted, and it
was not until Massey arrived that he
acquired the ribbon and star. The late
Judge’s widow was a daughter of J. W.
Jago, who in the long ago was a pioneer
in the fight with Bung, and managed the
Dunedin Star. It was a childless union.
The old man was always held in grateful
esteem by Maoriland trades unionists for
the courage and sympathy he showed when
he sat as first Judge of the world’s first
Court of Industrial Arbitration. It was
he who first gave trade unionists preference
of employment—and he strained the law
mighty hard to do it, too. He was 78 at
passing, in point of judicial service one of
the oldest Judges in the Empire and one of
the best.
For three years past the Commonwealth
and Maoriland have gone halves in the
meteorological and wireless station on Mac-
quarie Island established originally by
Mawson’s expedition, and every day or
thereabouts weather reports have been sent
by wireless to Hobart and Wellington. Now
the station has been dropped, for a while
at any rate, because operators would sooner
go to the war. Macquarie Island is 900
miles south-east of Hobart and in one of
the stormiest regions of the world. There
is no harbor —merely heaps of rocks and
reefs all round and continual westerly gales.
It was while on a relieving trip to Mac-
quarie that the Federal trawler Endeavor
went down with all hands, and several good
ships have left their bones on the coast.
The chief products are penguins and sea-
elephants, which are boiled down for oil.
There used to be a peculiar wingless parrot,
but imported cats cleared it out. There is
also supposed to be a unique flea for which
Nathaniel Rothschild never offered £5OOO
or any other such fabulous sum, though
there is a frequent yarn to the contrary.
A CARD TO THE VILLAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
May the;year of Our Lord that awaits you
Be the worst your d —d kingdom has known!
May the curses of all them who hate you
Fall bomblike on you and your throne,
When the fame of your fancied successes
Is sunk in a slough of defeat,
And your people, distraught with distresses,
Proclaim you a Liar and Cheat,
And when Fate, in the form of a vulture,
Swooping down on the rout of your might,
Picks the eyes from the sockets of Ifultur—
The eyes that grew blind to the light!
May you break, like an image of plaster,
Bravely painted as iron outside,
When you drop to the depths of disaster
From the summit of arrogant pride !
If the prayer of an unrighteous writer
Doth avail with the Gott you revere,
You will frizzle in Hell, you old blighter,
Ere the end of the bloody New Year.
VICTORIA.

The Germans have discovered Australia’s
tenderness for the cow. A commentator in
a Berlin weekly says that in the country dis-
tricts of Victoria and “New Wales” the
people are of the same order of intelligence
as the cows they keep. “But as company
the cows are preferable, if only for the rea-
son that they do not expect you to appre-
ciate their conversation.” The reverence
Egypt once had for the bull, says this enter-
taining Hun, the Australians now have for
the cow, “and frequently live in the trees to
avoid disturbing their dairy. herds.” The
Bulletin can never forgive itself for having
overlooked those districts where cocky perches
on the branches that his cow may have un-
disturbed possession of the earth and the
fulness thereof.
“Romney”: In the pathos of its tragedy the
Boozers’ Lovemaking suffers nothing in com-
parison with the story of Hero and Leander.
Over at Auckland (M.L.) there are two
islands —Rokatoa and Pakatoa. The first
is used as a place for the accommodation of
the male dipso., and, of course, the afflicted
ladies dwell on the second. Thus the pro-
prieties are maintained and Mrs. Grundy
disappointed. At intervals a steamer visits
the joyless specks, carrying fresh guests to
replace those who have had their thirsts
quenched. On one of these trips the gents
suggested to the maidens that the tedium of
seclusion might be relieved, and they spoke
of the old Greeks and of Hinemoa. Where-
upon the shrinking maidens cast down their
eyes and lifted up their ears and murmured
“Give it a go.” So it happened that one recent
night a boat was silently launched upon the
waters and a crew of adventurers navigated
the mile-wide channel and blithely leaped
ashore on Pakatoa. Creeping stealthily
towards the building they rapped gently at
a window, which promptly opened and a
sour countenance emerged to inquire what
the intruders wanted. They had roused the
matron.

When smallpox started to mildly scourge
Australia a couple of years ago, the supply
of vaccine ran short and all sorts of places
were raked to make up (lie deficiency. Some
of the stuff was all right; most of it was
unclean or unholy and produced a heap of
unnecessary suffering. The sore arm of the
public was endured with much fortitude;
but there was supposed to be an under-
standing that authority wouldn’t do it again.
Yet the very next time a crisis arose tin 1
same authorities were caught empty-handed
once more. It is the shortage of drugs in
Australian hospitals that is now the serious
matter. The war demands have practically
exhausted the supply, and the famine is so
great that the N. S. Wales Government has
been forced to come to the rescue with a
special £lO,OOO to buy up supplies at en-
hanced prices. Of course, Australia ought to
make her own medicinal drugs. The health
of the people is, or should be, the very first
care of the State; and no decently consti-
tuted country ought to leave any part of the
business to the chance mercies of traders at
the other side of the world.

“Shuttle”: 'Nobody like a country mayor
for putting things agreeably. Our man was
handing over the wristlet watch. “I am
pleased,” he boomed, “to see that many
lads we reckoned loafers have shown the
stuff they are made of. In this town one
that, most of us called a waster, young ,
has volunteered. He’s not what we thought
he was.” Young was one of the
guests.

In Melbourne there have been bitter com-
plaints of the increasing length of sermons.
One plaintiff expresses himself: “Our min-
isters are all talking of the war, and make
it an excuse for extending their remarks far
beyond reason. I now go to church in fear
RARE BIRDS.—I.
and trembling, wondering when I shall get
away again.” The Bulletin advises the
employment of a timekeeper. Let a time
limit be fixed, and all arguments cease at
the sound of the gong. The clergyman who
refuses to abide by the rules can be uncere-
moniously counted out. There was, a few
years ago, a little Wesleyan chapel in a
Victorian township where this salutary rule
was set up by the preacher himself. He
realised that he was prone to get lost in
language, and wander aimlessly and end-
lessly if not recalled to himself, so he put
a member of his family on to snap Ms
watch noisily when the orator had had a
fair go. One night the young man snapped
and snapped in vain ; and having a girl to
take home by the long road round, lie finally
scandalised half the congregation by hissing
that next Sunday he’d bring a gun!
THE PRESCRIPTION.
DOCTOR (to elderly patient): “My dear sir, despite your years, the case is not hopeless.
If you give up every form of enjoyment you may live in complete misery to a great
age.”
“0.K.” : Being under the impression that
mixed-bathing had achieved the sanction of
Mother Grundy, even in Melbourne, I was
staggered to read that girls’ swimming carni-
vals, in enclosed baths, are entertainments
“for ladies only.” The modesty that excludes
men from a feminine swimming exhibition
under club rules must be impurely Mel-
bournean in character. It is certainly not
British. More years ago than I can calcu-
late I was one of a crowd at Brill’s Baths,
Brighton (Eng.), when the local swimming
mistress (who was a doosid
fine young mermaid) gam-
bolled in the water with a
male professor of the art.
He wore a much scantier
costume than the regula-
tion “Canadian” outfit of
to-day, and she sported
brief pink fleshings with a
flower in her hair. And
the audience was as mixed
as the performers. Yet we
were not expected to blush.
More recently I have seen
both sexes contemplating
the curves of Annette Kel-
lerman, or watching the
limelit proceedings of a girl
and a man in a tank at the
Tivoli, which was surely
the limit of mixed bathing
in an enclosed place. So
I’m wondering what the
dickens can be happening
at girls’ swimming carni-
vals in Melbourne that men are not admitted.
Mrs. Grundy has made my mouth water.
Practically she is saying “This is no place
for you.” I want to be convinced by
personal observation that her veto is strictly
moral. Otherwise I must protest against
having false imaginings thrust upon me.

Styles, Chief Secretary in the Labor
Governent in S. Aus., has used the war
as an excuse for doing a sensible thing.
Years ago some do-it-properly Minister
had the idea of sending out a Christmas
card. Then each Minister took it up. Then
it spread to' heads of departments. And all
the time the list of recipients grew and grew,
and the card got more and more elaborate.
Nobody wanted the cards particularly, or
knew what to do with the wretched things
when he got them; but the total snow-
balled up, and of course the taxpayer paid.
Now Styles has resolved to knock the whole
futility on the head, and silences grumblers
with the explanation that it is a patriotic
piece of war-time economy.
Whistler knew something of the gentle art
of detecting enemies. He said he could con-
vict the Almighty of one mistake —“He made
the Germans.”

The restless disposition that makes him
the champion striker also makes the coal-
miner a ready recruit. As a consequence one
in 10 of Stockton’s population is already
missing, while some of the other Newcastle
(N.S.W.) suburbs have contributed almost
as heartily. At Hebburn Colliery the num-
ber of wheelers has dropped from 42 to six,
and “the shortage of labor is acutely felt.”
Still the shortage of men at the pit may be
less serious than the shortage of men at the
Front, especially if those who are left behind
will only go on with their job and thus keep
the industry alive till the warriors return.
DEAD CERTAIN.
MRS. NUWIFE : “Can you guarantee these
eggs have no chickens in them?”
GROCER: “Certainly, Madam. These are
duck eggs.”
THE SIEGE OF HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As St. Peter leaned one evening on the battlements
of Heaven,
Puffing slowly at his briar and admiring of the view,
Ev’ning clouds that floated o'er him by an aeroplane
were riven,
And the Iron Cross of Prussia shimmered with a
radiance new ;
A machine-gun rat-tat-tat-ed like a postman knock-
ing madly,
Ere a trailing stream of leaflets fluttered slowly to
the ground.
Old St. Peter stooped reluctant and picked up the
nearest sadly
As the warplane turned and left him in a thoughtful
mood profound.
“In the name of the All-Highest, I demand instant
surrender.
You have four-and-twenty hours, and I will not
allow you more.
Should your General not be ready his immortal
sword to tender,
My artillery will open fire upon your forts at four.”
Peter read the words twice over and his lip with
scorn was curling,
When a passing angel saw him tear the German
screed to shreds;
O’er the battlements of Heaven the accursed scraps
went whirling,
And eventually landed on the stern besiegers’ heads.
Long hours passed in tranquil Heaven, and the
seraphim were dreaming
Lazy lotus-dreams of nothing at the rosy close of
day,
When a parcel of disaster high above their heads
flew screaming,
And exploded like an earthquake in a tower across
the way.
As the angels dived for cover half a dozen more
came singing,
Blazing songs of blood and ruin through the
quaking sunset skies,
And the air was filled with gem-dust when the big
shells started flinging
Fragments of the jewelled Heaven in the angels’
staring eyes.
Then the bugles in the barracks called the Regulars
together,
And the side-drums tapped impatient at each eager
column’s head,
While the cavalry swept forward to the white gates,
hell-foi'-leather —■
ft was Lucifer, Field-Marshal, who upon his black
horse led.
Regiments of stern-browed devils marched like
veterans behind him,
And the rumble of the field-guns drowned the thin
cheers of the crowd,
Which with nervous prayers and saintly to the
care of God consigned him,
As, enveloped in white garments, it stood very
humbly bowed.
And the devils fought like devils when, on Heaven’s
plains deploying,
They encountered Wilhelm s legions and made
Prussian Guardsmen stare,
For the Huns expected angels, and they found it
most annoying
To be bayoneted by devils, more especially just
there!
So they broke and fled, all yelling, and the siege-
guns ceased their clamor,
As the thin, black line of heroes gained the gunpits
with a yell.
Nevermore at Heaven’s ramparts will the giant siege-
guns hammer,
For the guardians of God’s Heaven are the reckless
damned from Hell.

“J.F.C.”: This was one for the band. It
was extra hot and dusty. They were tired
and bad-tempered, and didn’t obey orders as
quickly as usual. Kitchener would cer-
tainly not have been pleased with them.
When they halted the O.C. spoke very
plainly, telling them they were quite rotten
soldiers, and there was no excuse for not
keeping step when the band was playing.
Whereupon a voice was lifted from the ranks.
“If a man had as many legs as a centipe
I’ll betcher not one of ’em would be able
to keep time to that blanky music !”

The reflections of “0.K.” : —-
No news is bad news since the Censor became cus-
todian of the truth.
The brilliant victory of to-day is the regrettable
muddle of to-morrow.
An armed force is no stronger than its weakest
general.
War between a voluntary army . and an army
trained to national service is a match between “Gen-
tlemen” and “Players”—amateurs v. professionals.
Victory for the Allies is not yet in the air, but it
soon will be. What the pot-bellied Zeppelins were
intended to do the sporting aeroplanes will accom-
plish.
The Germans thus far have been fighting down-
hill. AVait till they start to run uphill. Fightitude
and fortitude are different qualities.
One of Britain’s misfortunes is that its Prime
Minister is incapable of hitting out. He can only
pat himself on the back.
The war will last until the Kaiser solemnly assures
his patient subjects that it will never end. Up to
now he has always been promising to finish it next
month.
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
SHE: “ I'm so awfully sorry you didn’t win
on that race.”

Cold Feet.”
HIS BUSY DAY.
SARCASTIC GENT. (who has had a narrow escape): “Why don't you run over me!"
FLIPPANT DRIVER: “ Ain't got time!”
Ted Colles writes of close shaves
Where hundreds and hundreds of men are killed or
wounded a fair percentage of bullets must go close
enough to neither wound nor kill, yet leave a trail
behind them. I have met scores of bullet-holes
through the baggy parts of sleeves and trouser-legs,
while perforated water-bottles are as plentiful as
dead Turks.
We had been away in a far gully one day digging
terraces of dug-outs for winter quarters, and Tommy
Snowball and Jack Campbell (two Melbourne Trinity
lads) and I were returning up our own gully to our
home under the trenches, when a bit of a dust-up
started on top. As the track could be enfiladed
by a sniper or a machine-gun from the Turkish
trenches we thought to complete the journey as
quickly as possible. We had got halfway along the
dry creek bed when odd bullets began to splutter.
Presently we struck an Indian squatting in the
shelter of a bend in the bank. He waggled his hand
and signified us not to go any farther. We sat beside
him, lit up our cigarettes, and soon were watching
the spurts of dust in the track that came from round
the bend. Meanwhile a dusty Australian soldier had
come up with us. He was middle-aged, clearly a
son of the bush, and by the mark on his tunic a
major. He was inclined to continue his journey
round the bend, but a warning dissuaded him.
“Yairs; I s’pose I’d better wait a bit,” he drawled
as he sat down ahead of us, next to the Indian.
After a while there was a lull in the firing. Begin-
ning with the Major we lazily rose to our feet. The
Major, with cautiously bowed head, stepped on to
the track first. Then Jack. They had just time to
incline their bodies toward the bend and —pfutt!
pfutt! Jack’s body swung sideways and he stumbled
to the ground. The Major stood dazed a moment,
then threw himself face downwards into the shelter
of the jutting bank. Jack scrambled after him.
We lifted his shirt-sleeve and found that the bullet
had entered the biceps on the outer side, gone
through, and now lay almost visible beneath the skin
on the inner side of his arm. There was no
haemorrhage; and as I handed Snow my field-
dressing to apply the Major called out that some-
thing had tickled up his back a bit. He lay where
he had thrown himself very pale in the face while I
whipped off his tunic, pushed up his shirt and ex-
amined his back. “I know the feel of it—l’ve been
hit before,” he said as he awaited my verdict. My
only answer was an unsatisfactory but expressive
“Gorstrewth! You’re lucky!” As he bowed his
head and shoulders the bullet had entered his tunic
a few inches below the collar and come out half-way
down the back. There was a faint pink line about
eight inches long as though from the stroke of a
switch across the back. Yet as close as it had gone
the bullet hadn’t broken the white skin anywhere.
It would take something of a mathematician to
gauge with scientific exactness the extent of this
“miss.”
AVherefore I nominate this as the prize close-shave
up to date. (Any other form of this luxury is
impossible here until there’s another issue of razors.)
It was in a Melbourne suburban court.
Evidence had been given that a soldier, while
in drink, had stopped a middle-aged citizen,
made remarks anent the chilliness of his feet,
awarded him a black eye, knocked him down,
bashed in his hat and dropped his handbag
inside a tree-guard. A domestic was called
to corroborate. “You have heard the de-
scription given by previous witnesses of the
behavior of the accused —is it correct?” she
was asked. “Yes, sir,” was the reply, “he
was most vulgar!”

“Curse o’ Moses”: This German-hunting
business, out of which some papers are en-
deavoring to make circulation, is becoming
a nuisance. The mob doesn’t
really know a German from a
bar of soap, and is as likely to
mistake a Scottish Highlander
or a cove from Cork for the
objectionable article as anybody
else. In my war-distracted sub-
urb they have been guessing at
my own nationality and won-
dering if I came from the Rhine
provinces or the East Prussian
border. All my efforts to prove
that I was an Australian abo-
riginal having failed, and my
assertion that I was a half-caste
Chinese being received with
doubt, I assured them that I
really came from Tuath de
Danaan, on the borders of Finland,
between Sanskrit and Cuchullain, on
the road to Magna Charta. Had I
claimed to be a mere Irishman with
strong Australian habits they would probably
have tied me up with a rusty piece of barbed
wire. I reckon it’s time we indexed our Ger-
mans.

“Oboe” : A recent Bulletin prints a par.
re the statements made by Whitsitt, M.H.A.,
in connection with the allegedly scurvy treat-
ment of returned Tasmanian soldiers by the
military authorities. I can’t understand
any responsible Tasmanian taking Whitsitt’s
electioneering yell seriously. Nearly all
the allegations have been proved either
wholly unfounded or outrageously exagger-
ated, and many of them have been publicly
denied by the alleged “victims” themselves.
All the others have been explained by the
military authorities to the complete satis-
faction of every ordinary, level-headed citizen
of Tasmania. The most charitable view is
that the excitable legislator has had his leg
pulled by some of the returned heroes.
* * * *
It was at a send-off to some Maoriland
officers, and the speaker wanted to emphasise
that two of the men had recently been mar-
ried. “Two of our friends,” he explained,
“are leaving 1915 brides behind.” (Loud
apnlause.)
“Verdad”: There are some peculiarities
about living at an altitude of anything over
12,000 feet above the sea, as I have been
doing for some years. Atmospheric pres-
sure is very light—only about 91b. per
square inch, instead of 151 b. at sea level.
This means that in the same volume of air
there is only a little over half the oxygen
there is at sea-level, so the lungs and heart
have to work much more quickly to supply
the blood with the proper quantity to carry
on business. At first, the slightest
exertion makes one puff like a grampus, but
later on one gets somewhat acclimatised.
One effect of the height is to make one nervy
and short-tempered ; little things often cause
one to fly off the handle —little things that
would be ignored in other parts. Water
boils at about 185° instead of the usual
212°. In other words, boiling water is not
nearly so hot up there. One can drink
soup and tea almost as hot as they can be
served. Yet it takes much longer to boil
things. Eggs need about 10 to 15 minutes
to boil hard. Beans are sudden death,
because the water does not get hot enough
to cook them properly. Ice that forms in
the beginning of winter —this is in the
Tropics, too —will remain till spring if in
the shade, and then it does not thaw, but
evaporates or sublimes, leaving the ground
below it quite dry. Ice feels dry to the
touch and not very cold. Water will fre-
quently freeze when the temperature of the
air is 10 or 12 degrees above freezing,
because the intense evaporation lowers the
temperature of the water till it freezes.
Evaporation is very quick, as one finds out
when one is taking a bath —the water dries on
one so fast that one gets a chill very easily.
The usual test for detecting bad tinned meat
■—bulged tins —does not apply, as any air
left in the tin when soldered up acts as com-
pressed air in the low pressure surrounding
the tins. On opening a tin of butter,
which always has a little salt water inside,
the imprisoned air has a habit of blowing
a few drops of this salt water into one’s
eyes, which is always interesting to the
onlooker.

“Cobaki”: The local magistrate of a
North Coast town, who as a side-line ran a
registry office as well as an undertakery,
heard an affiliation case. The mother asked
for 10s. a week. Defendant considered that,
the child could thrive on 7s. 6d. Solomon
didn’t think that was enough—los. was, he
thought, a fair thing. Thereon he made an
an order for 55., a proceeding which dragged
from the lady a surprised protest. “Yes
mum,” replied the beak, “I have no doubt,
as I said, 10s. is little enough; but don’t
you think you ought to pay half?”

A gentleman named Raven, who appeared
in a Melbourne court the other morning
charged with drunkenness and endeavoring
to eat the arresting constable, promised the
Bench that the moment he got free he would
sign the pledge. Quoth the Raven, “Never-
more !”
“READY, AYE READY!"
“And when do you expect to he called' to the
Front?"
“Oh, at any moment now. They've had my
telephone number for over three weeks.”
HArPY NEW YEAR!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As the hangman only gets 2s. a day, and £3 3s. for
every man he hangs, he sometimes experiences dim-
culty in making ends meet. — Melb. paper.
They mean to hang me Monday morn —
I killed a little man.
Nay, blame me not, for all forlorn
I met him with a can.
He told me he had been for beer,
And credit was refused him. Here
He shed a most appealing tear;
Then with a “neddy” plugged with lead
I sort of rearranged his head.
I hang on Monday morn at nine—
Drop in if you’re inclined.
The Judge’s eyes were full of brine ;
He wept till he was blind ;
The jurors sobbed, and sobbed, and said
It hurt them (oh, their eyes were red!),
But p’raps I would be better dead.
I did not think ’twould pain them so,
So said maybe I ought to go.
And then we bade our last farewell;
And so to-day at nine
The hangman gets me. Truth to tell,
That was my sole design.
I’ve heard of him ; his poverty
Made quite a sad appeal to me.
Now he will get his three-pounds-three.-
A happy New Year it will bring
The hangman’s home. And so I swing!

Gone to the Last Judgment, Joshua
Strange Williams, for 40 years a Judge of
Maoriland Supreme Court, and at his pass-
ing a member of the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Council. Williams, a son of
that Joshua Williams, Q.C., wlio was the
greatest legal authority in England half a
century ago on real, estate, graduated with
great distinction at Cambridge, and landed
in Otago before he was 25. There he held
a provincial job for a year or two, and then
went in pursuit of Costs; but at the Bai-
lie was so little of a success that when the
\ ( Ogel Government lifted him on to the
Bench the local Six and Eiglitpence reck-
oned the end of all things had arrived. But
that was Six and Eight’s mistake, for
A i Ilia ms turned out to be one of the finest
Judges— perhaps the finest—Maoriland
knew, lie had the judicial mind, a broad,
kindly outlook on life, a great tolera-
tion of men and a deep understanding of
human weaknesses. Though he lived a life
of singular exclusiveness he never lost touch
with the world, and behind the grey, sombre
exterior of the man was a reservoir of
humor and charity.
FOR MILITARY PURPOSES.
Germany has fixed a maximum prior for leather,
and has confiseated all supplier that can hr use. for
military purposes. -Cable.

“O’Phimerty” : I was at school with Alf
Vincent in Launceston (Tas.). Ilis talent
was already showing itself, for his maps
were the star exhibit when visitors came
along to see what the school could do. But
Vincent captured a healthy hiding one day
when a humorless master discovered a cari-
cature of himself instead of a map. A
quiet, solitary kid even then, he got more
joy out of making sketches of other young-
sters Ilian from joining in their games.
Old John Davies, member for Melbourne
Irovince in the Vie. Legislative Council,
Attorney-General in the late Tom Bent’s
last Cabinet, and now’ President of the Coun-
cil in succession to Henry Wrixon, deceased,
lias had a wedding celebration—a “golden”
one. In anticipation the Council, which is
n, ;)Yj! dn - v s quite a happy family, had a little
jollification,_ drank the bride’s health, and
gave the bridegroom a gold tobacco-box. As
the old fellow is an inveterate smoker (he
gets through a full pipeful every day, even on
Sunday) the gift will be a continual re-
minder of the lads in the Council during the
long periods when the Legislature does not
meet
DECIDEDLY OUT OF ORDER.
THE LONG FIRST: “What’s your opinion of
anti-sh outin’, Fa tty?”
THE FAT SECOND: “Seein’ as you ’avc the

what one might expec’ from a gentle-
man of your breedin’, ’Erbert, to raise
the question at the present time.”
Australia’s oldest Anglican, reverend is
alleged to be Tlios. 11. Goodwin, who was
93 last month, lie arrived in Australia in
1552, took up mission work amongst the
aborigines at Yell a. near Mildura, then
shifted down to Melbourne, and is winding
up at Ivew. lie quitted work and started to
prepare for his own finish 23 years ago.
Arthur Robinson, once M.L.A. for Dun-
das (Vic.), who landed unobtrusively in the
Leg. Council after a short sea-
son in the House of Reps, as
member for Wannon, is an in-
corrigible recruiter. Since his
worldly affairs are seemingly in
a sound condition and there
appears to be no just cause or
impediment why he shouldn’t
handle a trenching-tool, many
a time the question hath been
put “When y’ goin’ yehself?”
As a matter of fact, it is not
Robinson’s fault that he is still
at home. He did volunteer, but
the medical authorities whis-
pered something in his off ear
which lie couldn’t answer—be-
cause he didn’t hear it. Then
they turned him around and
said “Sorry!” in his other ear
and passed him out, a man with
only half liis ears being inelig-
ible for the A.I.F.—-in theory,
at any rate. In practice a bit
of wire-pulling has been known
to open the door to'less even than half of
one ear.
Exit from his office, at the end of the
year, G. J. Dashwood, the veteran Crown
Solicitor of South A ns. Attorney-General
. &uglian, in handing over the customary
inkstand from the Law department, re-
marked neatly that Dashwood had “bridged
the continent” in the public service. He
was once S.M. at far-southern Mount Gam-
bier (S.A.). and his best work was done as
Judge and Government Resident of the
Northern Territory while it was still the
southern State’s white elephant. Dash-
wood gets eight months’ leave of absence
and is succeeded by Richards, LL.D.. whose
best work for years past has been done in
draftsmanship for S.A. Parliament, and in
pointing out to excited politicians that the
amendment just made to clause 127 requires
something; equally drastic to clause 4“ if
the Act is to. have any sense. Dashwood
was, if anything, too mild and genial for
a Crown Prosecutor, and the enterprising
burglar is understood to be wondering with
much interest whether Dr. Richards will
play the game more strenuously. He comes
from the pretty stern Bible Christian stock
that bred Chief Justice Way.
Twenty years ago Dr. George Horne was
an established practitioner at Clifton Hill,
and continued to be a landmark on the
main road —originally the bullock-track to
Heidelberg and Wood’s Point —until last
year, when he took a few months off and
went to England. He was having a quiet,
interesting time among the restaurants and
operating-theatres when the noise of battle
broke in. Seizing a colonel’s commission
and a bag of instruments, Dr. Horne tore
for the scene of trouble; and the “few
months abroad” lengthened into a year of
hospital work in the north of France. He
came back to Melbourne the other day, full
of good words for the Australians on med-
ical duty in France, and prepared to corro-
borate with first-hand testimony anyone who
calls the German what he really is.
Some of Cinderella’s sons, in spite of the
physical deterioration caused by being born
and brought up in Darwin or its neighbor-
hood, went off confidently enough to answer
tiie Call. So far nobody, not even Abdul,
seems to have noticed the deterioration.
A alter Styles, the first N.T. boy to leave
his bones on the other side, was a grandson
of pioneer Tuckwell, one of the' historic
party, who escaped from the niggers in an
unbelievable craft made of horsehide and
bamboo. Walter Styles really had no right
to pass the medical test, for his mother was
born and brought up in Darwin, and never
lett it till she was a married woman with
a flock of children.
Every Australian with a £1 note in his
pocket is carrying round a photograph of
a miner for whom there can be no more
underground toil. He is the man kneeling
behind the rock drill which was photo-
granhed by Vincent Kelly, of Bendigo (V.),
in the Victoria Quartz mine, when the Vic-
tona was the deepest gold-hole in the world.
J he picture was afterwards selected to orna-
ment the back of the £1 note to remind the
money-carrier everywhere how the metal
behind the paper is won. Now the central
figure of that little working party of nine
years ago is a coughing invalid with the
deadly dust of the drill in his lungs and the.
damp of the low levels in his bones. Peace
also has its tragedies !
Parson Fitchett, who wrote “Bleeds that
Won the Empire” and compiled “Fights for
the .h lag,’ is in hard luck. He has quite a
lot of sons, but all of them are married, and
al have put on various degrees of flesh, and
all are doing comfortably in city enterprises.
It is a prosaic business this of staying at
home to look after baby.
“Jean S.” : Obituaries of Alf Vincent omit
references to his efforts as a water-colorist
lhe artist’s industry in this difficult and
delicate medium was little known, for pri-
vate commissions and a reasonable income
from other sources relieved him of the neces-
sity for an exhibition to dispose of his
achievements. Without being great he
painted Nature with a facility that ’ took
the eye .of the average man. He particu-
larly. enjoyed Oriental subjects, and a couple
ot. visits to. Asia and Egypt provided him
with material. In good health Vincent
worked assiduously on this branch of his
a «- t ’ /°f lie that dabbling in color
afforded a pleasant relief to the eye-strain
brought on occasionally by hard labor in
black and white.
M?w Commissioner John Harper, of the
. I J^ lh T ay -, s ’, t° ,( l the Government last
week that he had had enough of it; and after
42 years service it seems a fair thing. He
had climbed from the bottom rung of "a clerk-
ship, and he didn’t carry many black hairs
by the time he reached the top. But if he
had had a hatful the last few years would
have shaken the flour-bag on them. He had
tor . years to work alongside the auto-
cratic lom Johnson, a Chief Commissioner
who. never gave an Australian railway-man
credit for anything; then bump a Govern-
which made friends of the Norton
Griffiths syndicate ; and finally struggle with
a afflicted with the slow-down
maggot. He deserves a rest.

Baron von Bissing, brother of the tem-
porary Governor of Brussels, is the most
favored of all the notorious enemy aliens in
Britain. At the outset of the war the mili-
tary authorities arrested him and proved
a case against him, after which he
was interned luxuriously at Brighton
(Eng.). This was more than the natural-
ised Ilun financiers would stand in those;
early bull-dosing days, so Von Bissing was
soon released. Possibly Mr. Asquith wrote
him an apologetic letter which Lord Hal-'
dane delivered in person. Anyhow, the
Baron swanked at large until public opinion
shamed the second Asquith Government into
re-interning him. But he isn’t on the same
footing as other and less dangerous Huns.
He has a large sitting-room, furnished by
himself in an expensive manner, and he is
allowed concessions in consideration of his
exalt'd rank and German family connec-

ALD. JOYNTON SMITH,
M.L.C., OF SYDNEY.
Last week Melbourne Argus announced
the death of Arthur Stanley, M.P., “a
brother of Lord Derby.” The sorrowing
journal stated the age of the alleged de-
ceased and his former occupation; also it
mentioned that he had “seen service in
South Africa” as one of the Yeomanry
known as De Wet’s Own. Next day the
Argus found that it was Albert and not
Aithur Stanley, M.P., who had died, the
politician m question being a Labor member
ot eight years standing. But not a word
was said about his former occupation nor
ms age nor his achievements. In the hun-
dred eyes of the Argus a mere brainy
Worker who pushes his way into the House
of Commons is a member of no consequence
compared with the brother of a peer who
gets there through family infl
UNDER COVER.

Sweet girl, whose bright, protective smile T see
In fancy guarding my domestic peace,
Accept my courtship, haste and marry me,
And bid my various fears and tremors cease.
I have not known you long, but love comes soon
To spirits well attuned, in days like these;
Here on my knees I ask the happy boon—
Kate, be my own; do wed me, if you please.
This frightful war that scourges sea and land
A noisy thing and dirty past belief-
lias tried to push a rifle in my hand,
And nowhere save with you I find relief.
Wedded to you the days would fleet away;
The progress of the storm we need not note.
Your wifehood would enable me to stay
Behind the shelter of your petticoat.
My income, I admit, is rather fine;
It is not much in which to put our trust;
But surely, sweetheart, we might well combine
To run a laundry for our daily crust.

The £16,(500 written off and shown in the
last line represents deferred stock which
was purchased at a discount with the
£14,385 set aside for the purpose out of the
previous year’s profits, under an arrange-
ment made with the old creditors. The
trouble dates back to the smash of the bor-
rowing boom, over 21 years ago. This
co., like so many others, couldn't pay up its
deposits at once, and made an arrangement
as to profits which finally shook down to the
following: (1) 4 p.c. interest to be paid
on tbe debenture and preferred stock for
which part of the deposits had been ex-
changed; (2) 3 p.c. to be paid on the de-
ferred stock, representing other old debt;
(3)£15,000 to go to reserves to ensure pay-
ment of interest; (4) 14 p.c. extra to de-
ferred stock, if available; (5) of the bal-
ance, one-fourth to be used in nuying up
deferred stock and the balance to be avail-
able for dividend. The excellent plan is
adopted of writing down assets to the extent
of the face value of the deferred stock pur-
chased. Thus the true position of the bank
is being steadily improved : the effect is just
the same as if the amount was put to
reserve.
The liabilities on account of the old
trouble have moved in this way :

The stocks now in existence are perpetual,
except only that the bank is under the
obligation mentioned just now with regard
to the deferred issue. All this money is
thus for all practical purposes as good as
share capital. But there is this difference :
it carries a fixed 4 and 3 p.c. in bad times
and a fixed 4 and 44 p.c. in good times.
With very cheap money it might pay the
bank better to be able to work on ordinary
deposits; but in times such as ive entered
upon a year ago the E., 8. & A. is singularly
fortunate: and with good management and
ordinary luck it ought to now continue to
make good profits. Anyhow, it is in an
excellent position to do so. Certainly it didn’t
do as well during the 12 months to the end
of June as in the previous couple of years ;
but that was no doubt due mainly to the
shrinkage of foreign exchange business, the
outcome partly of the war, partly of tbe
drought. And this paper won’t blame the
management if it also palmed a bit up its
sleeve to feed contingencies, seeing what
common birds contingencies are just now.
What changes have occurred in the figures
in the past 12 months have strengthened
the bank: —

The public’s withdrawable money in the
business is £7,593.294. and the liquid assets
are £4,799.250. That is to say, 13s. of every
pound is in cash, money at short call, Gov-
ernment securities (£364,037) and remit-
tances in transit. The position from the
depositors’ point of view is thus extraordi-
narily strong —thanks of course to the inter-
minable deposits. On the other hand, be-
cause of the size of those interminable
deposits, the shareholders’ risks are very
considerable. For while the share capital
gets the benefit of the investment of this
comparatively cheap perpetual deposit
money, it has to stand tbe racket if any-
thing goes wrong with the investment.

The Australian Provincial Assurance
Association, Ltd. (Sydney), which began
apparently with £BO6O of preliminary exes.,
or anyway showed that much on the issue of
the first accounts :
Income. Claims. Expenses. Deficit.
Mar., 1912 .. £8,060
Oct., 1913 ..£10,219 £289 £15,213 £16,343

Oct., 1915 . . 28,663 1169 29,689 30,589
The deficit is the capital not represented by
tangible assets. In the published balance-
sheet there is an item “Establishment account,
£31,608,” and on the other side there is a
reserve to meet unexpired risks, £lOl9. The
is £67,782, so there is nominally
£37,1J3 left. Actually, however, there is
much less than that, because liabilities have
been accumulating under the policies from
the day the first risk was taken. How
much that accumulated liability now
amounts to there is no way of telling, nor
will there be until an actuarial valuation is
made, and it is not proposed to put an
actuary at work until the end of the fifth
y ear. The law doesn’t compel it —in which
respect, as in a thousand others, the law
doesn’t know its business. Parliaments,
which mostly consist of men who are too
lazy to do anything but talk, shrug their
shoulders and say, “Oh, we don’t know
anything about this.” And because there
are no votes to be got one way or the other,
they don’t trouble to learn. Unfortunately
the avenige man in trade or business knows
just as little as the Parliaments. Hence he
is an easy victim for the ivild-cat insurance
concern. Positively during the last five
years insurance policies have been issued in
Australia by cos. which have been so stone-
broke that when claims or other expenses
have had to be met they have raised the
money by going out and selling more shares.
The A.P.A. isn’t that sort of concern ; it
may, in fact, just miss being a wild-cat.
Put still its methods are bad. It tries to
glue the public’s eye on one thing: the
growth of business. It issues leaflets show-
ing by pyramids the rapid movement to
over £1,000,000 of policy figures. That
looks very impressive, no doubt. The pub-
lic, uneducated on this point, doesn’t realise
that that million is a million not of assets
but of liabilities. When a co. says it has
in force a million pounds’ worth of policies
it means that it has undertaken to pay a
million pounds when certain things happen.
Obviously the first thing to be ascertained
by the persons to whom the co. has under-
taken to pay this money is Where is the
money? When any insurance co. seeks new
policies by _ setting out the growth of its
policies, which are really liabilities, it ought
to be compelled in the same document to set
out also the growth (if any) of the assets
with which those liabilities are to be met.
Here is a case, for instance, in which not
only has every penny of the premiums been
absorbed, although claims have liardlv yet
started to come in, but £30,000 of the share-
holders’ capital has gone as well. So far
as the policy-holders and their premiums are
concerned A.P.A. stands for All Paid Away.
. • vears . policy-holders have paid up
170, including all interest-earnings, and
the expenses have been £70,375. That is
exclusive of claims; every penny the policy-
holders have paid and over £20.000 besides
has been required to pay canvassers, agents,
collectors, clerks, doctors and directors.
Now that, is the position as it stands.
What are things likely to be? And that of
course is the important point. What chances
have the policy-holders of getting their
money? If things went on as they have been
going, and if all the premium income went
out in expenses, there would of course be
nothing for policy-holders. But this must
be kept in mind: the early years of a life
insurance office always do show bad figures.
Even if you regarded this year’s business
of the A.M.P. as the business of a new
office, it would probably show that the ex-
penses amounted to close-up 100 p.c. of the
premiums. After the first year the cost,
instead of being 100 p.e., should be under
15 p.c. Unfortunately in this case the
figures are not improving like that. Those
quoted in what purports to be the directors’
report are not to be swallowed with the
eyes shut. The _ cost of the new business
is said, with certain qualifications which need
to be carefully noted, to have been £14,291
= 89.2 p.c. of the first year’s premiums.
Very well ; then as the total exes, were
£29,689, the other business cost £15,398.
And as the old business and the trifle of fire
and accident business brought in £11,848, the
cost of this lot was 130 p.c. To suggest an
expense rate of 59.2 p.c. for new business is
plain nonsense, and the management ought
to be ashamed to submit it. The fact is
that the outlay for the whole revenue, old
and new, including interest (which didn’t
cost much to earn), was 104 p.c. For the
present policy-holders are no doubt pro-
tected by the substantial share capital still
intact. But that won’t last if things go
as they have been going. They must im-
prove or there will be a smash. And The
Bulletin wants _to lay stress on the fact
that an increase in the new-bu'siness figures
is not necessarily an improvement at all.

The business is 75 years old, and the pre-
sent co. has had it for just on 20 years.
But in the co.’s first dozen years things
went on with much the same dignified tread
as they had moved previously. The capital
was all provided by the old proprietors and
their friends; and as there were no public
dealings in the shares, so that nobody was
afraid of knocking the market about, there
was no special reason why dividends should
be kept more or less uniform. Consequently
profits were cut up as they were made.
Hence also the poor little reserves which
the co. had after 10 years of fairly prosper-
ous life. But the true position was doubt-
less better than those figures suggested, be-
cause money spent on the premises, and
fairly chargeable to capital, was paid out
of revenue and charged up with working
exes. That practice was continued for some
time and to some extent afterwards; so
that, apart altogether from the unearned
increment, the big fixed-property assets are
most likely worth something more than they
figure at in the books. This makes the co.’s
financial position even more captivating than
it looks on paper. Assets total £774,221.
Deduct £BO,OOO for goodwill, which is still
permitted to afflict the balance-sheet. That
leaves £744,221 tangible. Deduct £206.719,
the total of the liabilities. Stock stands at
£188,33S ; liquid assets, £94,196; premises,
£446,687. The capital is £400,000.
Considering (1) the extent of the busi-
ness, and (2) the fact that an amount ex-
ceeding the capital is in premises, the lia-
bilities are exceedingly small. The figures
wouldn’t be possible but for the small
amount of book debts. Debtors owe the co.
only £35,135 —quite enough, certainly, but
surprisingly little when the nature and ex-
tent of the business is taken into account.
The vast bulk of the trade is done for cash ;
and that means, not only smaller working
exes, and no bad debts, but ability to catch
trade discounts without leaning on the
banker. It would be unreasonable to expect
the profits of the past few years of the
borrowing boom to continue. Money has
been so easily come by recently' that
almost any old price could be put on the
spring millinery. It isn’t going to be like
that always, and it will make a big differ-
ence in profits when the aforementioned
spring millinery is marked 14s. lid. instead
of 295.. lid. But the shareholder in
Farmer’s will have one fine cake of conso-
lation on his plate: the stock and etceteras
much more than represent the liabilities,
leaving the whole of the capital represented
by freehold premises, mostly in the very
heart of Sydney.

It is a remarkable record, and it wouldn’t
be possible in a country that was decently
governed. The business of the co. has been
to buy land wholesale and sell it retail, and
at the same time give people help to build
or buy homes. The public borrowing boom
has steadily inflated values, and this and
other cos. have reaped the benefit. It
wouldn’t be too much to say that the boom
of the Holman-Griflith spendthrifts has been
worth £150,000 to this co. alone—and its
entire capital seven years ago was only
£45,763. The disclosed profits for the past
five years have been £154,531. and there are
no doubt considerable amounts stuffed away
to meet contingencies. A public policy
which assists a non-productive speculator in
land to make profits like that is thoroughly
rotten.
Under normal conditions the co. will do
from fair to poorly; and the conditions
ahead of us are worse than normal. But
for the present, “though sales have fallen
off during the year, the revenue from inter-
est on investments and rents shows a satis-
factory increase.” “Investments” consist
almost entirely of borrowers’ and pur-
chasers’ balances: these represent £224,500
of the total of £289,310 of assets, and
£57,626 of the balance consists of freeholds.
There is still so much borrowed money in
circulation, and the wool, wheat and other
prospects are so satisfactory in N. S.
Wales, that repayments are no doubt being-
kept up splendidly. The whole position
couldn’t well suit the co. better. The un-
certainty ahead of a co. of this sort lies
always in the kind of bump it will get when
the boom bursts. If it is a sudden burst
the co. is likely to be in great difficulties.
On the other hand, it can practically escape
loss if the bubble, instead of breaking, col-
lapses gradually—which it seldom does. This
time the co. has had what amounts to a
warning of the impending break. The war
expenditure is, in other words, artificially
prolonging the boom : and that gives the co.
a chance to get in its money, while making
no new advances on the old boom values.
By the time things get really sick the co.
ought to be _ pretty well covered everywhere.
If it isn’t it will belie its astute manage-
ment.
Though this paper lias grave doubts about
the maintenance of profits at even half the
present height, the directors are capitalising
another £26,204 or thereabouts. The idea
is to offer present shareholders one new
share for every five now held. Some shares
are fully paid to 205., others to 17s. 6d. The
new shares will be paid up to the same
amount as the old ones in virtue of which
they are issued. If shareholders don’t want
shares that carry 9 p.c. and are at a good
premium, they can take cash. This special
share-dividend will be paid on February 1.

nambool, Vic.) was established in 3909, but

The shareholders didn’t carry a vote of
thanks to Bloodstained Bill; but well they
might. “The whole of the output of the
mill for the next nine months has been requi-
sitioned by the Defence Department.” It
is really a dreadful thing that any con-
cern engaged in war work should show more
than (say) 10 p.c. net-on its funds; yet
nobody . seriously expects that the Govern-
ment, either of Britain or of Australia, will
save the people’s money in that way. In
addition to the £12,338 of profit shown above
£1750 has been put by to meet Federal and
State income taxes, and £2398 has been pro-
vided for repairs and replacements. v Advan-
tage has been taken of the unhealthy pros-
perity of the co. to get in more capital. A
couple of years ago it stood at £27,229; now
it is up to £43,455. This and the fine cash
revenue of the year has allowed the co. to
make big improvements to plant and still
keep a cash balance. Only 12 months ago
there was an overdraft of £13,502. To-day
there is no overdraft; and, though trade
creditors have claims for £6661, there is
£3lOO cash in hand, with £10,973 of sundry
debtors (good as cash no doubt) and about
£17,000 of stock and raw material on the
way to be stock. Altogether a remarkable
transformation.

This was a baby of the old Melbourne boom ;
and when the bubble broke capital was writ-
ten down from 19s. to 2s. per share. The
21 p.c. dividend hasn’t therefore meant any-
thing like that to the old shareholders. The
profit for the -year covered by the last ac-
counts was cut close by drought and the
high price of provisions ; and in view of the
gloomy outlook and the pretty heavy debt the
dividend was passed. After providing for
the dividend last year the liabilities (less
liquid assets) were £38,368. They are now
£36,001. In 1905 they were £54,017, so that
satisfactory progress has been made in the
10 years.

Westralia’s gold output for 1915 will be
the lowest for many years, and little more
than one-half of that for 1905. The cry is
continually raised for new mines, but only
an odd one or two came to light during the
past year, and for every one that arrived
several became extinct. Minister for Mines
(’oilier recently twitted the Chamber of
Mines with being too mean to put anv money
into prospecting, and said that while
£2.t, 000,000 had been paid in dividends,
nothing had been put back in systematic
prospecting. The Chamber retorted that it
neither owned mines and shares in mines nor
got dividends, and had never had any money
lo put into prospecting. Some of (lie cos.
associated with it had, however, spent tons
of money in testing and developing options in
the State, and one—the Lake View and
Oroya Exploration—had got rid of about
a quarter of a million in this way. These
cos., the Chamber said, were still willing
to go on loosening their purse-strings when-
ever and wherever inducement offered. Con-
ditions are not the same as they were when
Coolgardie and Ivalgoorlie first came into pub-
lic notice.. Then thousands of gold hunters
went out into the wilderness and hundreds
with cheque-books and fountain-pens fol-
lowed on their heels to buy up and float
anything, worth having. Nowadays the
country is so well scratched and the chances
of finding rich surface shows are so slender
that the inducements to go out are not
nearly so good as they were. Consequently
few men go. The mining cos. express their
willingness to test everything worth trying
More than that they claim they cannot be
expected to do.

Favorable features of Westralia’s year
have been the improvements at depth in
the Lake A iew and Sons of Gwalia, the
proving by diamond drill of the permanency
of the Edna May ore shoot at depth, and the
resurrection of the Lancefield, which in the
hands of a syndicate of Westralian mining
managers is now doing well. Unfavorable
features have been the absence of good
developments in the Kalgurli and Persever-
ance, and the probability of both these one-
time great mines going under within the next
year or two.
Lake \ iew and Star’s ore reserves at
February 28 last were 426,301 tons, worth
265. Bd. per ton. Recent development at
2100 ft. in the. Lake View lease has opened
up ore averaging 31s. over a width of 83m.
and a length of 850 ft.. while in a winze sunk

Efficient grinding is one of the many problems
that mine managers have to solve. The Ilardinge
Conical Mills have proved to the Calumet and Ilecia
Mining Co. that grinding is not such a difficult
problem; they have installed 64 of them, and say
“The Hardinge Conical Mill is the most efficient
grinding machine we have yet gotten hold of.” If
they say this of the mills, it should be worth the
while of mine managers here to inquire about them.

Oroya co.’s Hannan’s Star property the
grade is rather low. Profits are likely to
suffer for a few months in consequence of
this; but directly the co. can get at the
better grade stone at 2100 ft. in the Lake
View, things should he righted. At the
co.’s Yuanmi mine 43,451 tons were treated
during the year ended June 30 for £79,003,
and the net surplus, exclusive of London
exes, and depreciation, was £7788. Indus-
trial troubles and plant alterations are the
official reasons assigned for the decrease of
profit. Ore reserves (45,502 tons, worth
415.) are up 6092 tons in quantity and
Is. 9d. per ton in value. A tine shoot of ore
has lately been opened up in the bottom
level, and additions are to be made to the
treatment plant in order to put up the
tonnage and earn bigger profits. The co.’s
option at Warriedar looks very well. Queen
of the Hills made a profit of £15,055 for the
year ended June 30, and on that date was
estimated to have 37,453 tons of 325. 9d. ore
in sight. At present it is in trouble. A
plant designed to treat 4500 tons of oxidised
ore is only able, now the latter is exhausted,
to deal with about 3000 tons of sulphides,
with the result that the cost of handling the
lesser tonnage is too high to show any profit.
There are not enough reserves to
additions to the plant. The Lake View and
Oroya is to blame for this. It starved
development, grabbed all the profits.it could,
and now doesn’t seem to care what becomes
of the mine.
A new co. whose shares were rushed in
Melbourne the other day claims to have
found stacks of 2oz. ore in the abandoned
workings of one of the old North White
Feather’s cast-offs at Ivanowna. The yarn
that a co. which had to give up left stone
of that value behind wants a lot of corro-
boration.

Edna May Central (W.A.) is very sick.
The No. 3 level (225 ft.) drive which was
extended from Edna May ground has proved
a disappointment. An air compressor is on
order, and this looks as though hard country
will have to be contended with in future.
No divs. to date, and if none can be got as a
result of operations in soft country, the
prospect of disbursements from hard ground
is remote. The market looks as though
the inside crowd has unloaded and is now
“shorting” a few thousands.
* * * *
The Edna May (W.A.) is progressing
with the installation of its new pumping
plant in a very leisurely way. The Deeps,
across the line, are stamping their feet with
impatience and cursing the Edna for not
getting a move on. The Deeps know the
new plant will ease their water pressure,
and the Edna knows this too and
does not seem anxious to oblige. Yet
if the Edna does not soon become
obliging, Deeps may be drowned. Some
of their people reckon they have struck
an inflow of water equal to 3,000,000
gallons per day, but this estimate is over
the fence. But why do not the Deeps pub-
lish each week the total depth of their shaft?
One is likely to get tired of such reports as
“Cemented 14ft.” Shareholders want
figures with some juice in them. They
would like to be advised how much nearer
the reef they are this week than the week
before. It is unofficially reported that the
shaft is down 300 ft. It, should strike the
reef at about 525 ft. Certainly, the bore
struck the reef at 443 ft. The point of
intersection, however, was a long way east
of the shaft.
* * * *
Speakman’s (W.A.) is bucking up a bit
on a report from the new manager that the
mine will pay after “initial difficulties,”
which are mostly mechanical, have been
overcome. Meantime the battery is being
got in readiness for the treatment of what
is described as 200 tons of good ore. Some-
thing similar was said about the last parcel
put through the mill, but returns were far
below expectations.
* * * *
The Broken Hill labor geyser has been
bubbling all the latter half of the year.
Justice Higgins thought the men would be
satisfied with a shilling-a-day rise. But
what’s a bob to men who have been earning,
in many cases, a pound a day? They de-
manded a 44 hours’ week in addition —which
meant, in effect, the abolition of the Satur-
day-afternoon shift. Higgins wouldn’t agree
to it, whereupon Higgins was told that he
didn’t count, anyhow. That annoyed him,
and he threatened to withdraw the shilling a
day. “All right,” they said. “Then we’ll
take a holiday.” He asked the big union
whether it approved of such tactics. It re-
plied that it was really standing aside, and
the men were doing all this in their indivi-
dual capacity. Higgins said that that
wasn’t good enough, and he would have to
consider what to do with a union which
merely stood aside and let its members defy
the law. At this stage somebody seems to
have said a few words to the militants, and
as a result the Saturday-afternoon shift is
being worked pending the hearing of an Arbi-
tration case. “Go before the Court, you
fools!” was what the militants were advised.
“You couldn’t pick a more suitable lime in
50 years for getting a juicy award.”
Vegetable Creek Tin (N.S.W.) has had
the best year of its existence, three divs.
totalling lOd. being paid. Prospects are good
just now, but there is a long way to go
before shareholders get the 16s. per share
that has been put up. The ground landlord
has been on the best wicket. The location
of the elusive gutter at the Strathbogie end
is a matter of importance. Water has caused
difficulties and delays in working,, but these
troubles cannot well be avoided in alluvial
lead work.

Dr. Mulholland has put the rule over the
Goobarragandra gold mine, near Tumut
(N.S.W.), and has furnished a report
which so excited the syndicate that reserve
£lO shares were eagerly sought at £lOO.
Thus the co. is in the novel position for a
N.S.W. concern of having enough money
in hand at the outset to do all the work and
provide all the machinery that will be reas-
onably required at this stage. Dr. Mulhol-
land’s sampling results were: No. 1 shaft:
ore at grass, 40 tons, 4oz. 4dwt.; No. 2:
30 tons, lOoz. lSdwt. ; No. 3: 10 tons, 4oz.
14dwt. per ton. He estimates that to a
depth of 200 ft. (workable by tunnels) over
a length of 300 ft. there are 24,000 tons of
crushing material worth £8 18s. per ton;
total, £213.600. The value of the ore at
grass is £1562. The expert’s summarised
opinion is that the mine “constitutes an
important discovery the full value of which
has by no means been determined. So far
as prospecting lias been advanced it can
safely be said that the mine is a rich one
and is likely to keep up its promising repu-
tation.” A 10-head battery is on the way,
and if its talk is as golden as the expert’s
prophecy something will have been done
towards resuscitating the moribund gold-
mining industry of the State.

Cobar Gladstone (N.S.W.) has just de-
clared its third dividend of Od. per share.
This is a locally-owned copper show adja-
cent to the southern boundary of the Great
Cobar. No returns are ever published, but
as the dividends are paid out of tributors’
royalties shipping ore of a high grade must
be at command. It has the distinction of
being the only copper-mine in the State
which is making a profit. C.S.A., on the
northern side of Cobar, threatens to follow
suit when its smelting plant, now being
erected, is at work.

What constitutes a “miner”? This was
the bone of contention before a N.S.W.
wages board recently. Some men working
in a magnesite quarry at Fifield claimed
that they were skilled miners and entitled
to special pay as such; the employers
argued that the men were ordinary navvies
and only entitled to laborers’ pay. The
Board got out of the difficulty by drawing
a nice distinction. While the men are
stripping the overburden they are to be
laborers, and when they break the under-
lying rock they are to be miners. As the
magnesite ore is used for making firebricks
the question now arises whether the men
who work in quarries breaking shale for
building-bricks ought not to be treated as
skilled miners and paid as such !

The success of the little St. Mungo, Clon-
curry (Q.), set the St. Andrew’s going.
The show is owned by the same kind of
modest co., in 50,000 shares of 55.; and all
the directors are directors also of the St.
Mungo, except Edgar Brice, who owned the
mine from 1907 onwards, and boiled the
pot with stuff going from 38 p.c. down-
wards —average, 25 p.c. or thereabouts.
Since the co. took it over three or four
months ago a new shaft has been sunk
nearly 100 ft., and there is 4ft. of “fair to
good” ore in the bottom. The lease, which
is three miles from the Duchess, used to be
known as the Asquith. But as they were
after metal and not wind they changed the
name.

An experienced prospector who has been
for six months in the mountains back o’
Cairns, centred in the well-known Bellenden
Ker, tells The Bulletin there is not enough
alluvial gold up there to keep a Chinaman
alive. There may be reefs, but it would be
a very costly business to find let alone work
them.

Gympie is now more of a cocky than a
miner. In November BQ7B tons of stone
returned 36020 z., worth £12,309. No divi-
dends were declared, but calls asked for
£3454. Even the old No. 2S. Great Eastern
is so sick that there is talk of winding up.
Columbia Consolidated is also very unwell.
But the field has probably an undiscovered
patch of black slate somewhere, so prospect-
ing continues; for once there is black slate
near any of the reefs Gympie dreams of
candle-boxes filled with rich specimens.

“Dinkum”: Re Hatch’s Creek Wolfram
(B. 30/9/T5). The field is 596 miles from
Oodnadatta, 200 miles from Alice Springs
and 120 miles from Barrow Creek telegraph
station. It was discovered by a prospector
named Pedler, subsidised by the External
Affairs Department. At present only half
a dozen men are here. Owing to the
enhanced price of the mineral through the
war, they are doing well. Recently tons
sent to Sydney netted over £7OO. The-near-
est way to the field is via Oodnadatta,
thence per camels. The cost of carriage is
£2B per ton ; return loading, £l2.
“Ivum-kum-pona”: About two years ago I
read a Bulletin man’s warning concerning
the then-latest New Guinea dredging co. The
concern was going to place machinery on the
Yodda Valley goldfield, and in a year or so
serve out enough divs. to provide half the
population of Sydney and Papua with the
wherewithal for a world’s tour and eternal
rest thereafter. The thing turned out just,
as the prophet foretold. A couple of days
ago I struck inland whilst the steamer was
loading cargo at Buna Bay, and eight miles
from the coast along the Yodda-road I came
on about a mile of broken truck line, at one
end of which lay a tangled heap of rusty iron.
This was the aforesaid “machinery,” doubt-
less imagined by many trusting shareholders
to be already tearing from the earth its
yellow treasure. After several months jerk-
ing and jolting it had only covered eight miles
of the 76, and ahead lay country impassable
even for mules.
Commonwealth oil expert Wade has burst
up the Bruni Island (Tas.) oil boom as far
as his report can do it. He says that
neither himself nor any other person qualified
to judge lias seen any evidence of petroleum
seepages on the island. “To bore for oil on
the evidence which is available on Bruni,
and with igneous rocks forming the greater
part of the surface and the whole of the
foundation of the island at no great depth,
is,” he declares, “a waste of public money
at a time when money is required for urgent
national purposes and for legitimate enter-
prise.”
* * * *
Mines Minister Livingston (Vic.) lately
went up to the Loddon River and had a look
at the dredging business. He found the re-
ported devastation all right, the stream not
being fit to drown a dog in, let alone drink
or use about the house. So he laid down
the law: “This pollution has got to stop.
I'he dredgers are causing outrageous damage,
and unless they conform to the terms of
their leases these will be cancelled and the
district exempted from mining purposes
entirely.”
* * * *
“Iv.Cy”: “F.H.R.” (B. 16/12/T5), com-
plaining that he cannot get any Australian
mining man to inspect his Sin. leader of £l5
per ton stone, with a view to purchase, says
that his proposition is a better investment
in every way than a 3ft. body of loz. stuff
would be. Humbug! To get the gold-
spangled Sin. shoot as much ground has to
be broken as if it were a 3ft. reef; and
unless there are stopes to dump the barren
stuff into, everything has to be hauled to
the surface and “picked.” And whilst a
3ft. reef is “strong” enough to live even in
hard country, the Sin. stringer gets faulted
or pinched out easily. But wliat sort of
prospector is “F.H.R.,” anyhow, that he
isn’t game to stand by the 8-inch streak of
luck himself?

for the Bank of Adelaide directorship made
vacant by James Harvey’s death. A poll
put in Howard Lloyd, with the Ayers family

also ran, and scored 3646.

“Verdad” (which is Spanish for the
truth) :
Is there anything' in Australia, or in any other
part of the world, to equal the Cerro de Potosi, in
Bolivia (S. America) ? It is a conical mountain
rising 2500 feet above the town, and 16,000 feet
above the sea. Silver was discovered there by the
Spanish in 1545, and the mines have been working
ever since, but are now mostly tin mines, with
silver as a by-product. The ore used to be treated
by amalgamation, but is now mostly dealt with by
lixiviation by hypo-sulphite. It has produced by
these means £320,000,000 of silver. The mining
laws applicable to this mountain are peculiar.
After obtaining a license, anyone can start mining
where he likes, and he can go ahead until he
breaks through into his neighbor’s mine. The
system holds to this day. It certainly tends to
encourage rapid development of the mines, because
he who develops most quickly gets the most ground.
In the old days it was generally considered cheaper
to let the other fellow do the development, and lie
in wait for him, and kill him when he made connec-
tion with your mine. Then all that had to be done
was to hide the body, and put the boundary mark
well into his workings, so that his successor would
have to accept that position, having no witness to
the contrary. The Potosi lodes continue rich down
to the lowest workings, 3000 feet below the sum-
mit. I saw a vein there recently, 7ft. wide, solid
sulphides, assaying in bulk 14 p.c. tin, and carrying
enough silver to pay all mining and milling costs.
And this is only one of many similar lodes.
* # * •
“McNorth”: Some of the regulations con-
cerning the metals commandeered by the
Commonwealth are giving a lot of trouble to
the wolfram gougers in the country back o’
Cairns (N.Q.). Wolfram containing more
than p.c. of bismuth or 4 p.c. of tin will
not be accepted. Nearly all the metal
obtained at Wolfram and Bamford, which
two places produce something like two-thirds
of the tungsten obtained in Australia, con-
tains about 10 p.c. of bismuth and a con-
siderable quantity of tin. But, thanks to
the policy of always getting a cheap foreigner*
to do things for us, there is no place in Aus-
tralia where the metals can be separated.
The gougers are thus up against it. They
can’t sell to the local buyers because the
Government has commandeered their output,
and the Government won’t buy the stuff
because the allied metals are over the regula-
tion quantity, and it hasn’t any means of
tearing them asunder. Apart from the fact
that the men who live by yarding up wol-
fram are seriously affected, the fact that
tungsten is of value in the manufacture of
hardened steel and that hardened steel is
just now urgently wanted in large quantities,
makes the whole business look like a muddle
resembling some such hopeless thing as the
Pacific Ocean, or Geo. Reid, or the Loans
Account.

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 27, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
Officially Sydney Government Douse is in
mourning. Earl De La Warr, head of the
Lady Edeline’s family, is dead. But the
head had been rather a trial to the other
members of the body. Twice the incorri-
gible had married, and twice he had been
divorced. liis first wife was one of
Brassey’s daughters; through his mother,
by the way, he r as connected with another
former Australian Governor, his Excellency
Lamington. In addition he had his financial
troubles, and altogether had too strenu-
ous a time to allow nature to carry him on
past middle age.
Suburbia hoped for quiet on Christmas
Eve, but got it only in patches. In the
Northern suburbs scarcely a dog barked;
elsewhere wandering musicians pursued
“Lost Chords” and invited the nearest ter-
race to “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing.”
Mr. “Bob” Anderson ducked his hard busi-
ness head when the authorities threw a
colonelship his way. He suggested as more
appropriate “General” with “storekeeper” to
qualify it. But the title was necessary under
military rules. The new Deputy Quarter-
master-General in Egypt was going to take
his wife, but the “Men only” edict blocked
the road. However, a son who is over that
way may renew acquaintance. The boy was
wounded in the long Gallipoli disaster, but
made a speedy recovery, and was in the
•trenches again when the great flit occurred.
Norman Murray, who married Miss Taylor,
a South Australian, had to eat a gorgeous
meal before the ceremony. It was a fare-
well dinner from the Royal Sydney Yacht
Squadron, spread in the club house on the
shoulder of Kirribilli. The chairman handed
the hero —long regarded as a confirmed
bachelor —the presentation silver rose-
bowl. Norman Murray’s mother was one of
the Annandale Johnston family, and well-
endowed with cash. Murray, sen., was a
partner in the one-time Sydney firm of
engineers. P. N. Russell and Co., which put
up the shutters many years ago when its
men went on strike.
The constant news item, supplied by ad-
miring relatives, that So-and-So has just got
a commission in a reputedly-swagger Brit-
ish regiment is beginning to pall. Nine
times out of 10 So-and-So belongs to snob-
bish families which, having managed to make
a few thousands out of groceries or pickled
pork, don't think the Australian camps
that supplied the men of Anzac are quaite
the thing! I suppose there’s a kind of halo
round the whole family when young Fat’s
mamma can tell her friends (who try to
look impressed) that her boy is “in the
Guards, don’t you know”; in their fool-
ishness they don’t realise that the finest
soldiers in “the Guards” would have given
their ears almost to be numbered among the
men who won immortality at Gaba Tepe.
A golden-haired bride, Ivy Gertrude Keen,
a Randwick girl, said “I will” to Dr. Cecil
Burge, of the same village, last week; and
St. Jude’s was heavily splashed with white
blossoms to hear the whisper. Ivy’s
shining locks were wreathed with orange
blooms, which came to the tip of the
groom’s chin when he produced the ring.
Three pretty bridesmaidens, the Misses
Seri von and Scott, had embroidered the long
veil that floated like a mist over the bridal
plumage. The second best-man, Lieut.
Satchell, wore the fashionable khaki. The
honk of cars and the petrol thereof filled
the street from the church to the gate of
ihe Keens’ home, Portree. After the com-
pany had bustled into the marquee, the
handshakes began with great heartiness.
The bridesmaids, by the way, got ahead of
the season with their autumn tints. Mil-
linery in nigger-brown topped the frocks
that melted from deep apricot to
palest champagne. Long ebony sticks, with
posies of crimson flowers and autumn foli-
age, completed the decorative effect. The
bride’s beautiful frock had the touch of
pink without which, I believe, no smart
girl considers herself lawfully wedded just
now.
The Arthur Macarthurs, of Double Bay,
have lost their second son, Guy, this
Christmas. He was a lieutenant in an in-
fantry brigade of the A.I.F. Pneumonia
carried him off in an Egyptian hospital.
Mrs. Arthur gets a full measure of sym-
pathy from a large circle of friends.
The French-Australian League had its
first annual meet in Macdonell House the
other day. On the same landing War
Chest ladies were partly submerged in bales
of clothing they were tying up before
Christmas. Passing this hive, the traveller
arrived at the Sydney headquarters of the
French accent. Rows of trestle tables, like
laden bargain counters, creaked under the
goods the League sends to the suffering
orphans in North France. Mrs. Playoust.
at the head of a table that had been cleared
for reports and balance-sheets, made the
preliminary compliments. At her left
elbow Mrs. Jewitt read a satisfactory state-
ment. Miss Soubeiran then took the floor.
She had more glad tidings to tell, and
hurried through reams of compliments and
thanks from France. Mrs. Michel, wife of
the Governor of Paris, helped to swell this
chorus of thanksgiving. Every penny was
accounted for. Every bale of goods had
reached its destination. But the League
wants more, more; out of £14.000 cash only
£576 remains in hand. And though 50,000
or so garments have gone to clothe the
almost-naked orphans of the war, this winter
finds very many still shivering.
The Australian Field Artillery, in train-
ing at The Warren, Marrickville, is in need
of recruits. The O.C. isn’t looking for men
who want to play round town in uniform.
There’s hard work ahead of them; but it is
interesting work, and mothers and sisters
who wish Bill and Jim to get to serious sol-
diering might pass on word that Colonel
Pearce is waiting.
Miss Adeline Bourne, the hon. organiser
of the _ British Women’s Hospital, writes
that it is contemplated to add a Nui’se Edith
Cavell Memorial Wing. The committee,
which bristles with duchesses, is canvassing
for £50,000. This is to build a home for
disabled soldiers and sailors. The site of
the famous Star and Garter Home was pre-
sented to the Queen by the Auctioneers and
Estate Agents of England, and George’s lady
passes it on as a gift for the above cause.
The.proposed Home, to be supported by the
British Red Cross, is considered by the
relatives of the martyred nurse as a more
suitable memorial than the earlier sugges-
tion—a statue.
This January’s golf meeting at Kosciusko
resolves itself into a patriotic effort for the
war funds. The 26th is, as usual, the date
for driving the balls across the nine-hole
course.. Janies Paton, president of the
Mountain goff club, plays a good game, besides
being the handy man who gives out the
prizes. Prof. Warren goes to Kosciusko for
the end of the Christmas holidays. I don’t
know whether lie takes his affable bulldog
to inspect the ankles of those present.
At the Red Cross dames’ parting benedic-
tion to ex-Mayoress Richards, the presenta-
tion album was supplemented by speeches.
The most graceful tribute to the late muni-
cipal mother’s good works came from the
Tom Lluglies lady. She has been there her-
self, and knows what it takes to oil the
squeaking wheels of women’s meetings. Mr.
Richards handed in an extra certificate to
his wife’s capacity for minding her home as
well as her official chores.
The report of Leschetizky’s death has
a world-wide interest, for his pupils were
everywhere. A few years ago Laurence
Godfrey Smith went on a pilgrimage to see
his old master and take a short course of
lessons as a refresher. He described Mrs.
L. (No. 3) as a pretty young woman with
a profound admiration —of course—for hex-
great . musician. I fancy that, like most of
his circle, she was an ex-pupil. Yvonne
Chanda was aiiother Sydney pianist who
picked up a brilliant style under the old
man. The name is a summary of the mixed
races of Central Europe. Part Pole, part
Austrian, the famous teacher’s nomencla-
ture suggests a Russian sneeze.
The Maloja had a long passenger list from
this port. The Countess Morner, the sad-
looking lady who used to be Mrs. White, is
aboard. So is Mrs. Theo Marks, who gets
off at Colombo. Gordon Lowe, whose prow-
ess as a tennis player is swallowed in the
oblivion of war news, is aboard with Mrs.
Gordon. She is a London journalist with
a handsome presence, and used to serve the
Daily Mail. And Hugh Denison and his
wife are bound for London by the same
boa t.
At the Soldiers’ Club Mrs. Boult’s efforts,
resulting -from the Joan of Arc fund, dangled
on a Christmas tree in the recreation-room.
The gifts for some of our soldiers’ orphans
wei-e distributed to over a hundi-ed young-
sters. Even the sad-eyed mothers clieered
up at the joyful chortles of the children.
Dr. Mary Booth, who gives up her working
hours to oil the wheels of the club, suggested
the idea of holding the party in the big
George-street anchoi-age.
Concerning this Soldiers’ Club, the
spacious.building which used to be the Royal
Hotel will serve its present purpose till the
end of the war. New residential quarters,
with airy rooms holding about 30 beds in
all,, have been recently fixed up in the top
regions of the building. Looking at the
spotless cleanliness -of these comfortable
quarters one wonders if all the men who
tumble in and out of the club like noisy
children realise how much women are doing
just for love —to make them happy. Violet
IXay, a girl’s effort, first gave the funds a lift.
Then Wattle Day brought more cash. This
was used to fit up a second billiard room.
On Friday Christmas bush was the pretext
on which the public’s pocket was picked for
the wounded and weary soldier-man.
The Macleod girls, May and Amy. of
Dunvegan, Mosman, who only cease from
war-work to sleep and peck a "little, gave a
lantern-lit evening garden-party on Wednes-
day. The leafy lawns that slope to the
lapping tide made an ideal stage for the
festivity, which had its mainspi’ing in
groceries. Guests who weren’t active enough
to climb the hill with a 501 b. bag of flour
or a gross of tinned comforts forwarded
them beforehand, and they were piled high
m the billiard-room. The gifts are for our
boys in No, not in Gallipoli, but
somewhere out that way.
The Guildhall School of Music, with
Landon Ronald as chief, held its annual
students’ concert a few weeks back. The
programme is starred with two Australian
names. Rene Maxwell, the Sydney soprano
who won a Royal Academy scholarship soon
after she arrived in London, takes first
place. Since her introductory success she
achieved a Guildhall Special Corporation
scholarship and the Pearse Morrison Memo-
rial prize, 1915. The latter is for dis-
tinct enunciation —a good thing for any
Australian to win a prize for. Two-thirds
of the recent importations, dramatic and
musical-comedy, from Muriel Starr upwards
or downwards, are inaudible at the back of
a theatre. Rebe Ivussman, formerly a pupil
of Kretschmann, now a Corporation scholar,
has been steadily winning prizes as a fiddler
in the Guildhall competitions. She showed
rit the same breaking-up party.
A nurse-girl back with her charges from
the other side says that her chums at the
Lady Dudley Hospital, much as they appre-
ciated the picturesque appearance of her
Ladyship, did not altogether appreciate her
presence. It seems she always wore white
kid gloves, which rather annoyed the nurses
who had to do the work. Somehow or other
the term “limeligliter” originated in this
hospital, and soon became popular in all
the wards where the aristocracy sought
“work.” But “limelighting” wouldn’t have
been so bad if the limelighter hadn’t invari-
ably talked to German prisoners in pre-
ference to wounded . Englishmen. Just
because it was “the thing” to hear what the
brutes might have to say, of course!
Occasional word comes to Sydney friends
and .relatives from Mrs. Kirchner, once
Jeanie Walker, who “did” the Austral-
asian’s Sydney notes. She is still living
with her mother-in-law at Mannheim, in
Germany. Her husband has been wounded
fighting with the Kaiser’s forces —or the in-
ference. is that way. A guarded reference
to his injured leg is the clue. It’s a strange
terminus to the Australian woman’s honey-
moon. His well-informed country pounced
on him a year or so ago in Berne.
The. fact that Russia is familiarly the
Bear in the. international zoo. may account
for the revival in the Teddy’s popularity.
East year he suffered from the craze for
Billikins. Christmas, 1915, sees the smile
of Bill retire behind the fuzzy form of the
baby bearski. He is an awkward little
beast in crowded holiday traffic. But
whoever should lose an arm or leg in the
rush for home, the kid takes care it isn’t
Teddy.
The modern elocutionist, nothing daunted
bj ? . the troubles of Europe, invents a new
whip for the public’s back —feats in memor-
ising. Some members of the audience
show their appreciation of the reciter’s trick
of filling his brain-pan with Charles Dickens
by following the score to see if there’s a
missing word. The Marcus St. John mem-
orising of the Christmas Carol stories a couple
of weeks or so ago has apparently been
beaten by Lawrence Campbell. He claims
that his two and a half hours’ recitation in
the Conservatorium the other night is a
record. I hope so. If this sort of thing
is encouraged we’ll some day get school kid-
dies tossing off Carlyle’s French Revolu-
tion to intimidate their adult relatives.
All the Red Cross depots shut the front
door over the Christmas holidays. Nerves in
some of these centres were beginning to show
frayed edges—notably in packing-rooms—and
the rest will be a godsend. One of the pack-
ers’ tempestuous moments comes when she
undoes an involved parcel, and finds it stuffed
with everything, including very high chicken,
that is perishable. At this crisis language
is seen rather than heard.
The big Sydney man, Hugh Mac Neil, and
his wife have possibly blazed the wet trail
round the Horn via Maoriland. so far as
N.S.W. trippers are concerned. This road to
England is a novelty to the tourist with a
well-lined purse. But mountainous seas are
likely to add to the thrills of indifferent
sailers who take the track in January.
. “Kum-kum-pona’s” note from Rabaul: —
The best game here in German New Guinea at
present is bird-of-paradise shooting. One of the
local companies buys “raggianas” at SOs. per bird,
and it is a poor sport who can’t with a couple of
capable boys bag four or five birds per day. The
Australian military occupation permits the shooting,
but let the hunter stray one inch on the Papuan
side of the border and one bird will cost him 12
months’ hard labor without the option. Isn’t it
like the Australian Government to legalise in German
New Guinea what it penalises in British New Guinea?
Three white prisoners in Port Moresby gaol recently
were serving 12 months’ hard labor for shooting this
gorgeous millinery fowl.
A Monaro girl—at least her father man-
ages a station thereabouts —Hilda Harnet,
left, for Egypt the other day. She goes as
typist to the lied Cross Commission. The
fiat, “No more women allowed on the
premises” has yet to be dodged. But as
Hilda is going to a steady job and took the
Ferguson lady’s blessing on board the hospi-
tal ship, she may get through the girl-
proof entanglement.
Charles Robert Cran, who was admitted to
membership among the bulls and bears of
Sydney Stock Exchange last week, is a grand-
son of the late Chief Justice Lilley, of
Queensland. The young man is at present
in England in khaki.
The flapper having had her turn with low
collars and open-throated garments, Mrs.
Fashion intends doing a kindness for the
middle-aged and thereabouts. The newest
in collars rises from its old line to the level
of the chin, and wrinkles and double chins
will be lost to sight. Some of the new
fences rise, lace-edged, as far as the upper
lip. Seems to me the designer had one eye
on our sheepskin-vest collars when he went
looking round for something not exploited
before. Another notion is to fold tulle,
gag-style, across the mouth and tie a bow
at the back of the head, and if you don’t
like it that way you can lay it across the
eyes in the line of blind-man's buff.
The Merioola fete at Edgecliff contrived
to dodge the showers, and gathered a fair
share of patronage. Funds go to the 6th
and 7th Light Horse Comforts treasury.
Stacks of home-made sweets and Christmas
cakes, with Eadith Walker and other helpers
to tie up the goods* brought a rattle of coin
to the ballroom. Rut the public doesn’t
rush these fashionable shows. The funds
depend on the adjacent suburb, which
sends its scouts in evening dress to have a
look at its friends when they’re behind the
counter, so to speak.
Stacy Waddy, the cricketing headmaster
of King’s School, always a rolling stone in
the long summer holidays, has gone off to
Japan. The old school rests from its labors
for 14 or 15 weeks in the year (all told),
so the way of its dominies is one of fre-
quent recuperation. With Mr. Waddy went
Mr. Thomas, the idol of the small boys,
who generally spends his vacations close to
his daily toil.
“Paling’s Annual” has a strong scent of
Australian gum leaves. Isabel Varney con-
tributes a lively “rag” tune; A. Lithgow
is responsible for “Gallipoli March” : and
John Barr’s “So-long” (set to music by
May Summerbelle) and similar war-like
efforts are noted in the well-printed budget.
A Sydney man, ,T. French Lydall, M.A.,
who has been at Oxford, has been obliged ny
poor health to give the English climate
best. Lydall, a nephew of the Gen-
eral French who was recently created a
Viscount, fled this way again, to get Aus-
tralian sunshine into his bones.
The ostrich plume, which never really
went out of fashion, if the headgear of
female potentates like the G.G.’s lady counts
for anything, is returning with a rush.
Though it’s supposed to be a 1916 autumn
autumn fixture on velvet. pork-pie millinery,
every other motor chaise this Christmas con-
tains _at least one long, fluffy feather
dangling over the wheel. It is most becom-
ing finery, and the ostrich is to be congratu-
lated on having so much fluff in the family.
The girls at Ascham School gave a big
Christmas party to J;he kiddies of the
YV oollooinooloo Free. Kindergarten. When
Iladdy Santa Claus, from the depths of a
birds’-nest board, said he had come a long,
long way, the infants whimpered, but dried
their eyes to get their pockets filled with
sweets. Ascham in the bygone years was
Glenrock, the home of the late John Marks,
M.L.C., and its leafy Lawns made it a para-
dise for the babes from the smoky water
front.
The soldiers’ tea-garden buffet is likely to
be a January bloom. The City Council,
which is seething with the mayoral turmoil,
has not turned a listening ear to this sugges-
tion. It’s too busy searching for that cast-
ing vote. But Mrs. Christian, Mrs. Barff
and other enthusiasts have stormed the Chief
Secretary’s fortress and pressed their plaint
for a small, patch of the Domain. Just how
this buffet is managed will decide its success.
Too much Y.W.C.A. flavor in the tea will be
fatal.
The Old Gold and Silver Fund committee
has devised a scheme to soothe the feelings of
owners who still cling to ancient trinkets.
They’re going to get the camera on duty, free
of cost to givers of these old gauds. If Mrs.
Brown can at any time show Mrs. Green a
photo, of her former thimble—as worn by
her great-aunt—it’s a proof that the thing
really existed before the patriotic melting-
pot claimed its metal.
Mrs. Richard Binnie—a mighty knitter
of socks for the soldier lads —is taking a
short summer holiday in the bush. The
family leaves the Point Piper chalet for the
Binnie homestead beyond Singleton.
Mrs. Francis Anderson, who has a retreat
at Pittwater, took the chair at a recent
meeting in that watery suburb. A branch
of the Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers’ Asso-
ciation results from the gathering.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Boys’ Vaeatfloini Suits
Hoys’ Suits, in particular, come in for much strenuous wear during
the holidays, and it is in this regard that Farmer’s “Victor”
Clothing- for Boys proves its value. Each garment is made with
special attention to every straining point, the cloth being cut
amply but not too full, the seaming and sewing executed to
stand constant hard wear. Over 75 years’ experience is in the
making of these Suits, and they are daily proving satisfactory in
every respect.
The “CotswoldO Suit, shown here, is particularly suited for
vacation days—cut in comfortable sports effect, yet dressy enough
for the smartest street wear. Coat lias half-belt defining waistline
and yoke across shoulders, full skirt, and four outside patch pockets.
In Tweeds, Homespuns and Flannels.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, December 27, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The woman who was present at the
recent tar-and-feathers function is anxious
to overtake a misstatement circulated by
the Goldstein-Pankhurst- Johns sisterhood,
»-e., “a woman was rolled in the tar.” The
plain facts are as follows: The woman in
question knew the rooms, since they had
once been the studio of an artist-mend;
she also knew that the windows were wide
and the ledges low, and, fearing that the
coming m§lee might have dreadful conse-
quences, she pluckily followed the men up
the stairs. When she got to the top they
were flinging tar over Katz, the person who
had moved at the Trades Hall that the
Government’s recruiting circulars should be
disregarded. Katz called out “My eves—
you are blinding me!” “Don’t Hind him!”
begged the rescuer, and got in front. Katz
caught hold of her and refuged behind her.
She lost her footing and slipped in the tar,
but suffered nothing whatever from the sol-
diers. Some of them, in fact, helped her
up, and referred to her pluck and helped
her to a taxi. As the person with the best
right to speak, she will not hear a word
against the conduct of the men involved.
Crowds of our rich young men who have
got commissions strut about in perfectly-cut
khald and beautiful trimmings. It is mag-
nificent, but it isn’t war. Before they get
to the place where the lead flies their lovely
costumes will be taken off them and unto
them will be given slop-made horrors. The
sniper is always looking for peacocks; so
the game is to try to pass yourself off as a
plain brown barnyarder.
Since the Kaiser started his Day, Sassiety
women have lost interest in Third Wednes-
days and Ninth Tuesdays. The Day-at-
Ilome, ill its old, social sense, is quite dead.
The fashionable female still keeps it on her
card, but fakes it out in bed in a rest-cure.
She sees her most intimate women friends
and enemies, and they see her reclining on
elaborate pillows in a stupendous perforated
nightie, which is only rivalled by the very-
best lace bedspread. On such occasions the
hostess does without powder or high explo-
sives, and presents a pale, languid appear-
ance. If she has good hair of her own so
much the better. (The tied-on stuff always
will show on such occasions.) The mock-
turtle invalid usually engages one of her
nicest flapper friends to briskly pour the tea,
get the hot cakes and arrange the rose-colored
curtains _to the best advantage. And the
flapper listens to the grown-up gossip and
feels very well repaid.
The country is still doing a few wise
things. A small township reports the fare-
well of a resident off to the war. The
patriot’s friends presented him with a hall-
stand !
The Dental Hospital fang-pluggers gave
a dinner to Major Hall on Wednesday
night. The Major is the Commonwealth
Army’s dentist-in-chief, and has lately been
on an. organising round of the other States.-
Captain .Aitken, who is in complete charge
of the Victorian dentallers, cannot get room
at the Base Hospital for his work, so his
Collins-street private rooms are the centre of
the rush. Khaki men in enormous boots
tramp the peacock-blue velvet carpet, and
typewriters are clicking all day as fast as
soldier-typists can drive them. Captain
Aitken had to grant his lieutenants special
leave for the dinner, and one serious-minded
lieutenant took exception to the fact that
his pass had been extended to five o’clock
the following morning. He seemed to regard
it as an aspersion on his spotless character.
If the weather permits, the Frank Wal-
kers will give a patriotic moonlight garden
party at Wombolano, Ringwood, on the
night of Saturday, January 15. There
will be music in the open, food, fortune-
tellers and chatter within coo-ee of the eter-
nal hills. In case you don’t know, Ring-
wood sleeps amid loveliness less than an
hour’s train journey from town, and vehicles
will be in attendance to roll guests to and
from the station.
An erstwhile giddy Sassiety butterfly was
lately discovered tottering out of a Collins-
street library with a heavy volume about
lion-hunting in Greenland, or something of
the sort. “Goodness!” gurgled the dis-
coverer (the kind of girl who chooses her
book to match her Saturday morning Block
parade costume), “just look at your lovely
white suedes ! Why don’t you choose a book
that won’t split your gloves?” “Oh, Ai’ve
taken to reading,” yawned the book-express.
“There is nothing else to do in the evenings
—nothing happening except ‘pays,’ and I’m
sick of paying!” It’s not worth while being
a butterfly when there is nothing to butt.
A group of the best dames, discussing the
war over the tea-table, were nearly choked
with astonishment and cake when one guest
started to belaud the enemy. Growing more
and more excited _as the others slanged the
Kaiser and all his crew, she at last broke
into voluble German. A great and awful
silence supervened as the company rose in a
body and fled, leaving the wretched hostess
to settle matters with her Hunnish friend.
Of course she belonged to the musical-
culchaw crowd, which seems to view Prus-
sian militarism through a haze of Beethoven
symphony.
Some wandering Australians, just back
from England, went down to their favorite
summer quarters at a fashionable seaside-
suburb hotel, but recoiled when they found
three German waiters juggling the food. One
dame was in Germany when war broke out,
and the indignities she suffered made a
blazing patriot of her.
. At Murndal, the Winter Cooke squattage
m the holy Wannon country, the little-used
front gates were thrown open a few days
ago for the good of the Bed Cross. The
Cooke homestead is in a sequestered and
lovely spot, which even Governors
[salaam!] have been known to penetrate in
order to examine the squatter in his squat,
and so the fete had everything in its favor
from the start. When the figures are made
up something quite splendid is expected,
since probably half the population of Cole-
raine and Hamilton, apart from the imme-
diate Cooke neighbors, came along to buy
afternoon strawberries and soldiers’ tidies
and to see where Cooke keeps his fowlhouse.
Moreover, there were no expenses whatever
—not to the Red Cross Society. Winter
Cooke simply shut his mouth and opened
his cheque-book.
On Artists Hay I heard a lady at a stall
asked ‘Do you know Italy?” “Only by re-
pute, she answered.
Officialdom and its wife at our Australian
AavM College, which shifted up from Vic. to
JN - M ales during the year, sighed in loud
relief as it relaxed training and decamped
on annual Christmas leave. Things have
not been sliding on greased runners at Jervis
]’ a .y lately, and Kipling’s theory re the
Colonel s lady and Judy O’Grady being sis-
ters under their skins doesn’t apply at the
college. Social difficulties, my dear! Chap-
lain Hall and his wife, who couldn’t abear
it’, go back to England without tea or presen-
tations ; and Mrs. (Captain) Morgan reigns
in Arctic aloofness. Talk of writs and libels
flies around, while everyone wonders just
how peace may be kept, supposing it ever
alights again at the place where future
admirals are schooled.
From dear, legible Adelaide:—
The recruiting campaign was helped a little by a
special women’s meeting in the Town Hall on Mon-
day night, when the new Mayoress took the chair.
Mrs. Crawford Vaughan—who was one of the brainy
Goodes before she married, and has been a “pro-
blem” novelist since—was star-speaker, and Mrs.
Holder (widow of a very old Premier of ours and
first Speaker of the House of Reps.) and Mrs. J. F.
Young lent their voices.
At present the returned wounded slip into the
city without anyone being much the wiser, and with
an absence of demonstration that can’t be very
cheering. In future patriotic associations will co-
operate to see that the welcome is warmer. It is
reckoned that this will do recruiting a lot of good.
Mayor Isaacs has announced that his share of the
business will be to entertain the men at lunch.
Writing of returned wounded reminds me that Pte.
C. P. Green of the 10th Battalion, who has got a
D. was a member of the Metropolitan Fire
Brigade before lie enlisted. He got his “mention”
for leaving shelter to pull a wounded man out of
the water in the landing on April 25.
The estate of the late James Harvey, merchant
and shipping man, has been sworn at £137,000-
£lOB,OOO here and £29,000 in the other States.
A memorial portrait of Colonel F. M. Rowell has
been presented to the Cheer-Up Hut by the 3rd Light
Horse. It was unveiled on Tuesday evening, when
there were speeches by John Lewis and Lancelot
Stirling, both of whom have three soldier sons. A
returned Light Horseman who had served under the
Colonel also had something to say.
Dead of wounds at Anzac, on December 4, Pte.
C. A. Fuller, a grandson of the late Archdeacon
Sunter, who for years had charge of St. Paul’s.
The J. E. Thomases lent their grounds at Aldgate
for a Red Cross fete, which was opened by Mrs.
John Bagot, and resulted in a useful cheque for the
fund. The southern districts are taking advantage
of Lady Galway’s visit to Victor Harbor to rally the
girls, and meetings have been arranged at Yankalilla
and Port Elliot. This should make the Hun back-
pedal.
If you liave the money to spare, there is
quite a bargain-counter chance of picking up
a French lady’s maid nowadays. Nearly all
the grand dames are Red Grossing, knitting,
scrubbing hospital wards or odd-jobbing,
and the special dressing-room specialist is
out of a job. One young Australian bride
lately engaged a champion at a cheap rate,
and has brought her back to her suburban
home to madden the other cats.
From my friend “Tobac”:—
When I spare half a crown for a cigarette fund I’d
like to think it \\>s going to buy “fags” of home
manufacture—Australian smokes for Australian
smokers. But a terrible lot of cigarette money is
being spent in foreign trade. Whilst the Mayoress
of Hawthorn’s fund is providing the actual goods—
-200,000 cigarettes are shipped from Melbourne in a
week —I hear of rival fund-raisers collecting money
to buy English cigs. in England, or elsewhere. In
short, smart agents for foreign firms are booking
hundreds of little orders for cigarettes on the “fund”
ticket. All the subscriptions they get go to purchase
abroad the particular brand of cigarettes they are
pushing. Will you join me some morning in shooting
half a dozen of these hawks who prey in the
feathers of patriotism?
Mrs. Arthur Payne and sister Sybil
Stephen have blue-pencilled their projected
America and England trip on the cabled
advice of Arthur, who knows best.
Squatter J. C. Manifold, of the juicy
Camperdown district, is leaving his goodly
green Talindert and going to England, where
he will offer his time and some of his talents
for the usual purpose. Manifold has had
many bouquets handed him by all parties to
cheer him on his seafaring way—third-class,
of course, and wash yer own shirts.
Chaplain Bickersteth, who came out from
England to till cleric Tonge’s shoes at Mel-
bourne Grammar, is casting the footwear
aside and hastening warwards by the Maloja.
The handsome holy man was educated at
Bugby, but Melbourne boys found him a
good sport and never brought it up against
him.
Ben Gibson, of Malvern, went early with
the A.I.F. to Egypt and Gallipoli. The
other day his brother —dentist Jack Gibson,
who married the late Railway Commissioner
Syder’s girl Haldane —had the news that
Ben was dead, killed in action fully six
months ago. Ben Gibson was a tall, wide,
fair, curly-haired youth and an out-size in
soldiers, and a lot of people will miss his
large, friendly smile.
Christopher Gambetta, who may be seen
at any hour of the weary Education Depart-
ment day dashing around the Treasury
buildings with a bunch of highly important
papers in one hand and a stick of sealing-
wax in the other, has lost his 18-year-old lad
Noel, a signaller, killed in action at the
Dardanelles. Gambetta, a rather pic-
turesque figure in his way, with a fascinat-
ing Italian name and complexion, was left
a widower with a family of half a dozen
children to look after—Noel the signaller
among them. But he solved his domestic
problem by presently marrying one of the
handsome Murphy girls, then of Armadale
House, where the ghost of old Premier
Jimmy Munro dwells in the upper storey
even unto this day.
The one-time sprightly little Lottie Sar-
gent (now Mrs. Frank Greene) has, had
some more hard luck. She recovered from
threatened lung trouble some years ago and
went to live the simple farm life in the Vic-
torian Backblocks. Now the plucky young
person is being mended up in a Melbourne
hospital after enduring a severe operation.
Mrs. May Gilfillan (late May Vale) is one
of the unresting artists. Having made a
grand clearance of sketches and enamels at
her Centreway show, she is now working on
some of the fine old flower gardens near town.
Many of the old places are being cut up and
bricked over, and she wants to picture some
of the best while they are still undisturbed.
The present sketching-ground is the great
lavender beds in the Cates’s garden away
along Glenferrie-road —a restful, old-fash-
ioned corner with rambling paths, roses and
thickset hedges.
Erna Cadorin, who used to be Lovie
Mueller, writes from Italy that her sculptor
husband has put down his chisel, and is
about to sail for America. He has been
appointed to the Columbia University as lec-
turer on Italian art. When she wrote Erna
was a-bed suffering from an uninteresting
ear-trouble. She expected to make for the
U.S.A. as soon as she was well again.
Captain St.. Clair Steuart, the hazel-eyed
doctor who was called to attend many heart-
cases amongst the young married women <
St. Kilda before he enlisted, was one of the
first men to go to Suvla Bay in response to
a call for volunteers from the Bth Welsh
Regiment, which had lost three of its sur-
geons in a h Q ap. St. Clair Steuart —it’s
libellous to spell him with a “w” —sends
pencilled notes from the trenches, which he
says are not quite as modish as No. 3 Hospi-
tal, Lemnos, to which he was first attached.
Irma Caron, the clever singing daughter
of the late Leon, is thankful for a job in
musical burlesque, but wonders audibly why
she should have spent years learning how to
sing in five languages just to appear in
“Stop the Tram!” —or something like that.
The sixpenny songs in the bright frivol
require no effort and very little voice. A
trained vocalist has to “sing down” to them
in one language,—the one she learnt at
mother’s knee.
Tom Shelford, the young actor with the
lovely clothes and the long, sharp nose, who
has been playing hereabout, is a son of Cap-
tain Shelford, of the Omrah. The Omrah’s
wharfside fire last week delayed the liner in
Sydney, so the skipper was unable to see
his boy in a first-night.
After many years of employing Toms,
Dicks and Harrys in its drug department.
Melbourne Hospital has at length handed
over its assistant-dispensing job to a Nellie
—the first occasion in the hospital’s mottled
career when a mere woman has been per-
mitted to handle the sacred pot-and-pestle.
Nellie Clayton is her full name, and she
knows the drug business from here to yon-
dex*. Her grounding in pharmacy was
received at the Ballarat School of Mines;
but the years of medicine-mixing which won
her her present position were spent in the
ripe old Dickson jalapry at her native city
of Geelong. Miss Clayton’s late father was
a ixew r spaper man of wide experience on the
Victorian country press; in his maturer
years he drove a well-paid pen for the
Geelong Advertiser.
It takes a lot of bad politics to quite spoil
a person’s family. Mrs. I. 11. Moss, for-
merly vice-president of the humorous
Women’s National League, and exhorter-in-
general against the machinations of Sosh, has
a son-in-law. Captain Norman Harris, late
of the Vic. Railways, with the Engineei's;
and daughter Rita, Norman’s pretty wife, is
going to Cairo to see what she can do in
the way of hospital work. The other daugh-
ter, Dot, recently became -engaged to the
officer who was then Captain C. M. M. Dare.
Now, although not 28, he is colonel in com-
mand of the 14tli Battalion—probably the
youngest officer of that rank under the
British flag.
“Daddy” Lohr is proving a fine advt for
the hot springs of Waiwera (M.L.), where
he has been recovering health for many
weeks. Lohr, who was a very sick man
when his Melbourne friends last saw him,
talks of stopping the rest of his life in the
country where he has mended. He always
had a fondness for Maoriland in his old
showman days, and now he loves it more
than ever.
Alberto Zelinau courageously led the Phil-
harmonic Society through a performance of
“The Messiah” on Monday evening. The
white-robed chorus chanted “Unto us is
given a son” until the audience trembled at
the thought of the extent of the demand on
the Fisher bonus. The Philharmonic audi-
ence takes its pleasure quite in British
fashion—very sadly. It keeps a “comforter”
in camphor all the year. At Christmas time
this article is unearthed to grace the head
of its owner until the Concert Hall is
reached. Every member of the audience
carries a score of the oratorio and also
opera glasses. Presumably the latter a,
levelled to observe notes which might other-
wise escape notice.
The University Conservatorium had its
students’ concert in the Melba Hall in a
blameless white debutante setting that made
even German composers and Austrian
teachers above suspicion. This students’
demonstration of pure, peaceful art was
unspotted by so much as a Red Cross, a bit
of bunting or a patriotic button. Within
the. chaste walls of Melba Hall —all done in
white, with cream edgings in the way of
screens a,nd curtains —soulful art was able
to take itself seriously for an hour and a
half, and the world of bullets and blood was
snubbed out of existence. Two neutral
pianos permitted ingenuous youth to ham-
mer on their ivory to every German tune
you ever heard of. Golls, Pinsehofs and
Scharfs flourished in an atmosphere of
pupils’ reverence, and the white roof didn’t
fall or even blush. It was run on modest
school-room lines, with typewritten pro-
grammes ; and the only decorations were
examination tables and stray pens and
blackboards in a corner of the hall, and a
life-size Melba framed in white at the back
of the platform.
Some of the girleens at a certain “tony”
school revealed a quite up-to-date acquaint-
ance with things modern and a -lovely igno-
l’ance of things Biblical in their answers to
the . General Knowledge questions at the
Christmas exam. Here are some gem
answers:—
i s ru l e °t the Road? Slow down and hoot.
What is the Rule of the Sidewalk ? Do not expectorate.
Whom, did St. Paul baptise? The Unicorn.
AY hat is the Apocrypha ? An apothecary.
Give some Important Pact about
Sir George Reid. He tried to enlist
T _ and couldn’t.
AVho is Lloyd George? A famous singer.
In this last case the maiden was probably
thinking of Edward Lloyd, the mellifluous
tenor who, when he came to Australia, had
the elderly habit of reading his music through
a pair of tortoise-shell rimmed pince-nez
which he adjusted on his nose with all the
deliberation of a bishop.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Frank B.” sets them all right: “W.P.C.”
gets two recipes for curing his moke’s corns, while
“Spreader” says the real specific hasn’t come to light
so far. This latter is correct, turpentine conflagra-
tions, cotton wool, oakum and iodine notwithstanding.
“Pick’s” assertion that corns are due to defective
shoeing is not always right. Frequently this is the
cause, but constant work on macadamised roads or
blocks is just as often responsible; and sometimes
the trouble is constitutional. There is no certain
cure, but several ways of reducing the defect tem-
porarily. The rest cure is to be recommended ; but
to give immediate relief to the neddy have the ex-
screseence, or as much as possible, removed with a
sharp farrier’s knife. Then when the blood appears
fill the cavity with spirits of salts, shoe wide at the
heels with a bar shoe if the frog of the foot is at all
faulty, and there- will be no more trouble from that
corn for some months.
“A.B. AA: it’ “W.P.C.” lias not yet cut
off his horse’s hoof I hasten to inform him that there
is still an odds-on chance of curing the corn while
the. hoof remains in situ. A corn, so-called, is a
bruise of the sensitive sole between the frog and the
wall of the hoof, usually on the inner side of the
foot. It is most frequently caused by faulty shoeing
and leaving the shoes on too long. Briefly, the
principle of treatment is to remove ajj pressure
fiom the seat of the corn. This is best done bv
shoeing with a three-quarter bar shoe which all good
farriers know how to make and apply. The corn is
thus left uncovered by the shoe, and the weight is
borne by the other three-quarters of the wall and
the frog, which is capable of bearing, and should
bear, weight. The shoe must be removed weekly and
readjusted, care being always taken to keep pressure
from the affected part. On no account should the
frog or sole be pared with the knife, rasping and
paring being strictly confined to the bearing surface
of the wall of the hoof. So-called corn cures and
applications are useless. Of course, should compli-
cations be present, such as suppuration, the corn
must be pared out and suitable antiseptic treat-
ment adopted, until the urgent symptoms subside.
If “W.P.C.” follows this treatment his prad will be
cornless in a very few weeks.
“The Reefer”: “S.S.S.” (B. 25/11/’!5)
says that Papuans have the nice custom of naming
their, children after people they like, and as an
instance cites the belle of Hula village, who has
one Michael O’Mulligan’s moniker. 1 know llula
fairly well, and never happened against that cus-
tom. I think that the belle of Hula may prove to
possess a better claim to her illustrious name. In
fact, Hula should, an it got its rights, be able to
demand some very aristocratic names for portions
of its population.
* * * *
“Merrigal” : Some of those sheep-counting
performances have made a few of us scratch our
nulla nullas, but no one seems to have remembered
Alec Haley, once of Booberoi and Eulbendry (Vic.),
a. champion bridge player and all-round sport.
Ilaley at shearing time would open three pens
simultaneously and count the occupants off without
a bloomer. Even allowing that he had an idea of
the number in each pen before they fled it was a
slashing bit of work. For many a day there was
a hundred at Haley’s for anyone who could tally
jumbucks quicker and more correctly than the boss,
but it remained uncovered. Old Frank Sheppard, of
Mcrrygoen—none so dusty, either —saw him knock
off 30,000 in a day, and oily go one wrong in each
thou.
* * * *
“Pick”: One more for the casualness of
the bushman. AVhile scrub-cutting on Jacqua Flat,
near Bungonia (N.S.W.), Jim Manning was bitten
by a tiger-shake. He rebuked the familiarity with
liis scrub-hook, sawed out the bite with his tobacco-
knife, and went on grafting. After much argu-
ment we persuaded him that the toil could stand
over for a day, and Jim mounted the only horse in
camp to visit the doctor at Goulburn, 20 miles
distant. AVhen he. had ridden 15 miles he met
some cobbers and pulled up with them for an hour’s
yarn about the weather and the war. Then he broke
the news that he had been “nipped” by a tiger and
moved on to the doctor and the strychnine.
HOW DID HE KNOW THERE WAS
DANGER?
THE EDITOR: “ Have you shown these draw-
ings elsewhere?”
THE ARTIST: “No!”
THE TEDITOR: " Then why do you stand so
near the door?”
“Mulga”: The best cure for a horse’s
corn is the stockman’s, viz., wrap the hoof up in a
poultice of cow-dung' and clay. Repeat half a dozen
times, and the corn can then be taken out. A slower
remedy that used to be in vogue in the south-western
districts of Victoria was to turn the affected animal
into swampy country for a few weeks. The continual
moisture would do the rest.
MARVELLOUS!
CASSIDY (after listening to the Chow's argument): “Jist listen to that, now. Sure.
tis wondherful how thim poor, ignorant haythens understands one another. If you!
Hogan, was to say wan half o’ that gibberish ter me, Oi wouldn’t know phwat
yes was drivin ’ at.”
“Two Seas”: The senior-sergeant ex-
plained to the P.M. that the derelict just ushered
into the cage was found by a constable doubled up
on the road, where he would have remained for the
night had Good Samaritan D 137 passed by on
the other side instead of carrying him to shelter.
The sergeant also informed the P.M. that the exhibit
was 79 years of age, and as deaf as a Premier when
the public yells “Tote” into his ear. So the P.M.
after a few words upon the subject of nipping the
craving for beer in the bud, so to speak, burbled on:
if you take my advice, , you will stay in the
asylum if we send you there. You see, you can't do
anything for yourself, and I suppose three drinks
would make you drunk.
Whereupon the derelict shook his feathers up, and
leaning brightly over the rail, remarked:—•
No fear! I could do three drinks now, if——•
But the Law broke in with a loud shout of “Silence
in the court!” and hurtled the impenitent out of
sight.
“Sarto”: If this should meet the glad eye
of “Private Gumboil, J.P.,” in Gallipoli, let him,
the next time he is troubled with flies, try this.
Put on his sheepskin vest woolly side in, and then
spray the outside with a solution of arsenate of
soda and water. That’ll do it. We sprayed some
skins with this, as a preventive against weevils, and
next morning were walking on fly corpses a foot
deep. It was the sweetest bit of revenge I’ve ever
had. P.S. —Any handy drug-store will fix up the
solution and provide a spray. No doubt there are
plenty of drug-stores in Gallipoli.
* * * *
“Try Fluke” : Gallipoli purple-patch war-
riors tell of Maori war-dances in the trenches and
on piles of perforated Turks, and of how, now and
again, the brown tons ruffle the serenity of some
inspecting general with their awful yowls and stamp-
ing and thigh-smacking. B.ut the truth is most of
these khakied Maoris couldn’t do a war-dance if they
tried. They can liaha, but the real war dance is
something very different. The ‘‘lea-mate, lea-mate”
soldier scarcely lifts his 13-inch foot that distance
from the ground. The old-time Tangata Maori con-
sidered himself a hopeless cripple if he couldn’t leap
at least half his own height from the grass with
eveiy bark of the chorus. The peruperu proper is
a jumping drill and first-chop physical exercise.
The best peruperu I have ever seen was a war dance
by 120 men from the Taupo country, rigged only in
waist-shawls or in fandangling kilts made of the
inner bark of the ribbonwood. When they got
fairly going you could see the skyline under their
soles. At each burst they leaped three or four feet
in the air, with their feet doubled back under them
like a bird on the wing. Old white-whiskered Waka
Tamaira, of Tokaanu, Lake Taupo, drilled and led
them ; and if he is still alive I can recommend him
to Kitchener or Joffre as an Arcli-Druid in song-
and-dance battle tactics. I watched, 20-odd years
ago, 600 gun-armed Waikatos going through their
great tangi dance at old King Tawhaio's burial.
But they were not perfectly drilled, and the Taupo
war-party had them done brown.
‘Bareoo” : The lockup at Burketown, on
the Gulf ’ (N.Q.), has had two notable occupants
who took French leave. The first was Sam Flick.
In the early ’Bo’s he was awaiting- the arrival of the
Judge to stand his trial for horse-stealing and bush-
ranging. He removed a slab, and before he was
shot dead on Lawn Hill I fancy he accounted for two
of his pursuers. The second was Ben Bridge, who
had a profound weakness for a valuable thorough-
bred, and was also well known in connection with
the buckjumper “Dargin's Grey.” He and “The
Breaker” (Harry Morant) • were the only two to
master that famous animal. Prisoners in Burketown
were treated by the police very leniently, and Ben
was allowed his smoking utensils. One night his
place of confinement took fire and was burnt to the
ground. Bridge escaped in the excitement, and the
mount which carried him to his land of freedom was
taken out of the police paddock. Eight years
afterwards Bridge was apprehended in Westralia,
and brought back on the original charge. His was
rot parsons’ luck.
QUITE RIGHT, QUITE RIGHT.
THE OFFICER: “Have you learnt all the calls
yet, my hoy?”
BUGLER: "Nearly all, sir.”
THE OFFICER: "Do you know the assembly'?”
BUGLER: “Yes, sir.”
THE OFFICER: "Sow, what would you sound
if a fire should break out?”
BUGLER: “'Lights out,’ sir.”
luig : 1 lie black cockatoos I met in the
lisperance country of the West were just like those
of _ the Northern Territory described by “Alamon”
(E. 18/IX/’l5) except that whereas his cocky has a
wliite beak those in Westralia have their noses
painted deep red. Diverse species, or merely the
result of different liquor?

AS HE WALKED BESIDE THE TEAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I m taking out the team again—-
I’ve been three years away ;
I'm glad to meet the sun or rain,
And sing for joy all day.
Gee on, there, lad! We’re all too fat—
Come on! —but soon we’ll work off that
When once we get among the hills,
And drag the timber to the mills.
Hurrah ! We’re getting into stride.
I can’t believe I’m here,
Climbing along the mountain-side ;
The sky is bright and clear —-
And how the birds sing! Yes, it’s strange
To see the shadows on the range,
And feel the bush all wild and free,
As if it had been made for me.
The roads are bad. And here’s that turn
A thousand times I’ve cursed.
It’s just as choked wi’ stumps an’ fern
As when I came out first.
And that’s a while ago. Perhaps
I’ll meet, among the splitter chaps,
A mate o’ mine—l wonder which?—
And fill my pipe, and have a pitch.
If there’s a sport among- the crowd
He’s sure to know my name ;
My record stands, and, if I’m proud,
I’ve earned the right to fame.
Ten years ago the country round
No better hurdler could be found;
And in the high jump all could view
I cleared the bar at six-foot-two.
I’ve had good times, and cut a dash
At many a merry town ;
I loved the girls, and spent my cash
Until I settled down.
I don’t know how it came about,
But they’ve been years of dearth an’ drought;
Or why, when other girls were gay,
I married such a gloomy jay.
It must have been my fate. Ah, Well,
I’ve suffered for my sins !....
I’m short o’ breath, and, truth to tell,
Before the steep begins.
No wonder, with the life I’ve led —-
A chain and collar round my head,
And heavy work, and weary rest.
She might have done it for the best.
She had no looks, or style, or charm;
Yet at a word she’d say
From dawn I'd sweat upon the farm
Throughout the hottest day.
That was a change from days gone by!
I know the girls laughed on the sly
To see me toil behind the plough.
And won’t they all be laughing now!
She made me give up drink, o’ course;
I seldom ventured out
For sports an’ games, or backed a horse,
Or seen a boxing bout;
And I was careful what I spoke,
And lived as simple as the folk
Who never swore, or drank, or diced,
But worshipped at the Church o’ Christ.
For three long years, years dull an’ grey,
I lived thus, overawed ;
And then, last month, she went away—
And that was my reward!
She wouldn't make it up —you see,
I went to town, got on the spree,
And met a girl I used to know,
As in the days of long ago.
But now she's gone—the children, too —
I know she won’t come back.
I’ve sold the place What could I do
But take the old bush-track?
Gerrup ! Gee on ! It’s like a dream
To walk beside the bullock-team.
I’m back again, and young, and free !
Gee on!....And that’s the life for me.
VICTORIA.

There are Many Beautiful Models
from Which to Choose, in
The AEOLIAN-VOCALION
“THE INSTRUMENT THAT CALLS FORTH HIDDEN BEAUTIES FROM YOUR RECORDS”
WE show here three from among the
wide variety of beautiful models in
which the Aeolian-Vocalion may be
obtained.
This wonderful, new instrument is not only
far in advance of other makes musically, but
architecturally as well.
Indeed, the first impression one receives
of it is an entirely unprecedented beauty of
line and finish. Even the simplest model—
that costing but £2s—charms the eye both by
its design and rare piano finish. For these
instruments have all the rich depth of color-
ing that distinguishes the finest pianofortes.
An Invitation to Our—
New Gramophone Department
We want you and your friends to see and hear this wonderful new musical instrument. A spacious
cool and beautiful department is devoted to it at Pianola Hall. Our demonstrators are salesmen
only to those who specifically wish to buy. To all others their business is simply to exend hospitality.
Your visit, therefore, will entail no obligation but will be simply a pleasurable musical experience.

“Tom Donohue”: “Itan” (B. 11/11/T5)
mentions fountain trees. On South Trees Island (Q.)
after heavy rains I saw a tall cabbage gum growing
in a vegetable garden from which, about 85ft. from
the ground, a jet of clear water constantly poured
for three weeks. As it fell to the ground the water,
which was tasteless and free of sap stain, went to a
fine spray. The supply can have been nothing less
than three gallons per hour. I was told there were
small fish in it sometimes, but not always. An old
chap camped there informed me that another tree
about two miles away, on the same island, was also
doing the artesian business.

“Beeritus”: “Palmerston” (B. 2/12/TSV
asks whether a blackfellow is ever bitten by a snake.
Here’s one instance, anyhow. On Netley station,
Lower Darling - , in the ’Bo’s, was a nigger called
Tommy Damper. Damper was grabbed on the point
of the toe by a tiger whilst fishing, and the ensuing
hullabaloo in the camp brought some of us there in
quick time. Three nigs, were holding Tommy
whilst a fourth applied the remedy, which consisted
of much gashing with a knife, the mutilated part
being afterwards severely cauterised with a firestick.
Evidently the operation was successful, for two days
afterwards I saw Tommy Damper devouring a huge
junk of his namesake with much satisfaction. The
mutilated toe had been dressed with mud, and a fort,
night later the wound was completely healed.

“P.H.It.”: When “6 &8” says (B.
2/12/’l5) that the Scotch (black) thistle is more
uncommon than the variegated, broad-leafed kind,
he must mean in his part of Australia. In New
England we seldom see any but the black thistle,
which takes full possession of newly-rung timber
country for a year or two, and then chokes itself
out. This thistle is readily eaten by stock if cut
and left on the ground a day for the spikes to soften.
Horses eat the tops. It is a moot question whether
these tops fatten or only fill; but taking into con-
sideration that nearly all seeds are fattening, and
that the lowry parrot lives on them when they are
available, I don't think tliej* do any harm. I have
never seen a variegated thistle growing off a black
flat or rich watercourse bank, and there is no doubt
that hungry stock will succumb to them.

“Leo Lear”: Anyone know a more danger-
ous wood to put on an open fire than wild cherry?
It throws out sparks like a box of crackers, and I
guess insurance companies would stipulate against
its use if directors had ever put a log in their grates.
llnkit : I heard a woolly argument
recently as to liow many varieties of jumbuck have
depastured on tin's planet, and the following- were
dug out: Leicester, Border Leicester, Cotswold, Lin-
coln, Oxford Down, Shropshire, Southdown, Hamp-
shire Down, Suffolk, Somerset, Dorset Horn, Ken-
tish or Romney Marsh, Devon Long-wool, Ryeland.
Dartmoor, Exmoor, Wensleydale, Rosscommon, Lime-
stone, Cheviot, Black-faced Mountain, Herdwick and
Lonk and Welsh Mountain, Teeswater, Bampton
?votts, South Ham Notts, Irish (polled), Wilshire,
Dorset, Portland, Cornish, Dean Forest, Mendip,
Cannock Chase, Penistone, Delamere Forest, Scotch
Heath (black-faced), Wicklow Mountain, Kerry,
Bedford, Hereford, Cretan, Gloucester, Crimean,
Nottingham, Stafford, Worcester and Yorkshire. By
the time the Corriedales and the many types of
merino were reached the crowd began to run dry,
and this precipitated an adjournment. Perhaps some
Abo. can comb out a few extra varieties that escaped
capture during- the disturbance.

"D.F.”: A farmer at Castra (Tas.) re-
cently yanked out a potato which scandalised the
scale at 61b. If there’s a bigger one anywhere he
wants to know about it.

“Huffin-Guffin”: Have just visited the
original of Buvelot’s “Waterpool at Coleraine,” hang-
ing in the Melbourne National Gallery. The “Water-
pool is a muddy hole about half a mile west of the
township (Vic.). Little change has occurred in the
redguins around it in the half century or so since
Buvelot painted it. But one observes that last
wi: ler’s rains nearly made a sandbank of the water-
pool. Bryants Creek—the crock that overflowed and
caused the Coleraine flood of 1870—overflowed into
the waterhole, and carried tons of the sand from the
creek-bcd right up to within a few yards of where
Buvelot’s model lies.

‘ Billy T.”: -Patriotism is one thing, God’s
truth is another, and even though the world may be
resounding with praise of the gallantry of Australian
troops, I must tell of one disgraceful flight from the
enemy, the squad concerned has since gone where
it may with Heaven’s help retrieve its good name;
hut the bitterness of that failure, the shame of that
stampede in a moment of
danger, must ever abide with
us who beheld it. The squad
was drilling in Albert Park.
Three times its evolutions
had interfered with the morn-
ing siesta and profound ru-
mination of an elderly cow
harboring a calf. When the
squad approached the fourth
time the bovine rebelled. All
the mother in her rose up
against it. She planted her-
self squarely on her four cor-
ner posts, she lowered her
head to a convenient position
for hooking, and she uttered
a bellow full of anger. At
the same time her tail became
rigid with righteous wrath,
and signalled the opening of
hostilities. The squad ' fal-
tered. “Quick march !” yelled
(he lieutenant recklessly. His
honor was at stake; the eye
of his country was upon him.
“Forward!” he thundered.
The squad didn't
like its job, and
it was the cow
drew first blood.
She did her dash
and knocked a hole
clean through that
squad. She revolved
sharply, rushed and
punctured the line
once more. She
turned again. This
time the line broke
before her. Four
men were down. The
enemy deftly hooked
a fifth, and tore
two-thirds of the
dungarees off him.
She charged once
more. The squad
broke hopelessly,
and fled in four
directions, the cow
pursuing sections in
a frenzy of tri-
umph. She caught
t-ho lieutenant before he could take cover and
canied him 60yds. Then she dropped him, and
chased Private Smith into the lake. By this time
the rest of the squad was up a tree. It was a rout,
and the warriors could not collect their wounded till
the cow’s trainer could be discovered and put in
charge of the brute.

He wall ’: Re ants’ ability to cross water,
both when leaving breakfast and answering the gong
(B. 2/1.2/’ l 5). “Mrs. R.” had for years been baffled
by the pests bridge-building across the water placed
around the feet of the safe. At last she lit upon
the plan of substituting whiting for the water, and
since then has not had any trouble with ants in the
pie.
THE KAISER PLAYS STILL ANOTHER PART.
I lie London Telegraph says that Turkish priests are proclaiming the German Emperor as a messenger
of Mahomet mentioned in the Koran, in which he is called Muhub-ul-islam.— Cable.
Mr. Minns has also discovered that in a former existence his Majesty teas King Billy of
Buckinbungrah.
“Thunderer”: To-day a cheerful bush-
traveller told me that the biggest Maori would
crumple as soon as he got one solid punch on the
nose from a white man. It may be so; but being
only a lightweight I would hate to experiment on
the Maori or any other hefty chap with a dark skin.
I have an idea that the size of the puncher matters
more than his color. The most broken-up man I
ever met was a little Englishman who had gone out
to India and kicked a nigger. lie thought the pres-
tige of the white man or some such nebulous thing
would protect him; but it didn’t, .and as a result of
the hiding he got he walked sideways ever after.
He kicked the wrong sort of nigger.
* * * •
“Moana”: The other day, on a farm near
'Wanganui (M.L.), a starling’s nest containing a
number of almost-fledged youngsters was dis-
covered inside an old oildrum hanging up outside
a shed. The only way of entrance and exit was
through the bung-hole, and as this was only 1 Jin.
in diameter a healthy starling must have sweated
down considerably to get through. Of course, getting
into the drum Was a comparatively easy matter,' ISut
how the birds got out again is a mystery, for the
utensil was hanging upright and the nest was at
the bottom two feet below the bung-hole. In such
a confined space there was no chance of the starlings
getting on the wing and there was no ladder on the
premises.
“Viking”: “Hamer” (B. 2/12/’l5) may
have been giving “merely corroborative detail”
when he spoke of ants forming a living bridge to
cross water; but he was corroborating Ananias. Let
me say with great firmness that ants cannot cross
water which is over their heads in depth. In the
section of Queensland where I pay good money to
the landlord the ants are strongly entrenched, and
I have been forced, in self-defence, to study them.
The only method whereby they can bo beaten for
a meal is to put the legs of food receptacles in the
common porcelain ant-jars. It is here that such
people as “Hamer” make their error. The ants get
to the food despite the seeming security. The expla-
nation is that dust and fluff form a scum over whicli
the ants walk. The cure is to clean the receptacles
every few days. Then jars are absolutely the best
preventive. The best cure is to soak some meat in
vyhisky and creep on the ants while they are in-
toxicated and brain them. But that means using up
liquor which might be called for in a hurry to cure
snakebite, insomnia or wounded feelings.

Christchurch (M.L.) Museum got an inter-
esting exhibit the other day when James Jackson, an
ancient whaler of Tory Channel, handed it a com-
plete whale-boat in a fine state of preservation. It
was built in Tasmania well over half a century ago.
and was used for many years round about Nelson in
the harpooning game.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: An abo.-ist lately recorded
a Tasmanian ferryboat as a nesting place for a
pair of swallows. I can nominate two who sneaked
a daily second-return trip from the Victorian rail-
ways for their offspring. Having started their
house-building under the frame-work of a second-
class carriage at Mornington, they continued the
work, both en route and while at stations, until
a complete swallows’ residence made the d'aily trip
of 15 miles to and from Stoney Point. Finally eggs
were laid, family hatched and fluttering feathered
infants tested their wings against the engine’s best
speed. The bird that couldn’t keep up was lost
to home and mother.
* * * *
“Harry J. W.”: As it stood four-square
to the bullocky’s blasts of profanity it looked more
like a cottage built of meat than a living bullock.
The only sign of animation was the immense tongue
that regularly licked out of its bouy face, wiped its
lips with a flourish and flashed in again. And the
agonised bullocky danced before it with his whip,
like a high-priest before a graven image, and poured
impromptu curses into its vast ear. “Oh! ” he
yelled at the very end of his passionate address—
“Oh, you blanky, darncin’ Delilah!” Anyway, that
is the nearest translation polite literature will allow
of his gloriously inappropriate epithet.
THE OPTIMIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They’d started out from Teddy’s Well,
To Middle Distance they were bound ;
But when the burning evening fell
Poor Duncan to his horror found
A trackless country stretching round ;
Far as he looked he couldn’t see
A living thing, or man or tree.
A rocky ridge, a plain as dry
And barren as Hell’s ashpit is,
And up above a brazen sky.
Ben said his tongue if wet would fizz,
And Dan could fry a chop on his.
Now Ben was beat and Dan was stuck—
It but remained to trust to luck.
Next day the men ate their last crumb,
And saw no hopeful chance of more.
Ben glowered sitting on his drum,
And by the hour the rascal swore.
Much better Ben misfortune bore.
“Thank Gordi” he said, “though things is blue,
There ain’t no vvashin’-up to do!”

“HEARNE’S”
“J.F.H.” (from London) : My ancient
friend Morris Abrahams is dead at last. In
his young days performance of the legiti-
mate drama was limited by law to a few
theatres holding Royal patents, and these
patentees were always on the watch to pro-
secute anybody who infringed their rights.
The offenders were usually the lessees of
“saloons” —halls attached to pubs, fore-
runners of the variety theatres of to-day.
These “saloons” had the right to present
songs, dances and short musical plays. Pre-
sently leading actors and actresses were
engaged, and eventually the “patent”
theatres lost their monopolies and a number
of the saloons were converted into full-
sized, legally-conducted playhouses. Morris
Abrahams ran one of these “saloons,” called
the. Effingham, and when the better times
arrived he transformed it into the “East
London Theatre.” He also became the pro-
prietor of the Pavilion and other East End
playhouses, which were largely patronised
by his Jewish brethren. When he retired
from management Henry Irving started a
testimonial, which eventuated in the presen-
tation to the venerable Hebrew of the house
in which he died the other day at the age of
a hundred, more or less.
“Kaniva” : Julius Knight’s long-continued
popularity and triumphant reappearance re-
calls that when he made his first Melbourne
bow at the Royal in 1891, as John Christi-
son in “The Dancing Girl,” with an English
co. headed by Laura Yilliers, press and
public damned the performance most heartily.
Few men have made so good a run after so
bad a start, and Knight didn’t show up again
for some years until, as leading man in
“The Prisoner .of Zenda,” he achieved tin*
public handclap.
“Van Eck” : Uncle Sam is drawing a bead
on picture pirates. One was lately arrested
in N’York on a charge of violating the crim-
inal section of the copyright law. It appears
that he sold outright in three months £3OOO
worth of counterfeit Chaplin films. They
were copies of copyright productions. This
particular pirate worked a swindle made
easy by N’York methods of hiring out pic-
tures. He would get a film on a one-day
rental basis, copy it. and sell the result. So
long as manufacturers permitted their goods
to be handled on such a quick-lunch basis
the forger lived in Easy Street. But the
quantity of film he handled at last caused
suspicion, and his career was brought to a
sudden end. For all we know Australia
may be the dumping-ground of many dupli-
cated films ; in fact, judging by some of the
films I have seen since I landed back home
I am sure of it.
"Adelaide”: There is one actor with a
sense of humor on the local stage. He had
a small part in “Held by the Enemy” at the
Tivoli, and he caused the name given as his
own private moniker on the programme to
appear as “Ardley Reale.”
“Harrison 0.,” on his defence:—
My esteemed but excitable friend Hugh McCrae
seems to be under the delusion that some recent
observations of mine anent Melbourne Repertory
Theatre constituted a savage attack on director
Gregan McMahon, with the result that 1 have a
third of a column of reproachful nonpariel hurled at
me (13. 9/12/T5). I alleged that (a) “the Mel-
bourne Repertory players provide the most convinc-
ing performances to be seen locally” ; (6) “this is
due to the excellent casting of the plays by Gregan
McMahon”; (c) “he [McMahon] has the gift when
reading a play of visualising its characters”; (d)
“mostly the Repertory performer who speaks his or
her lines with moderate intelligence ‘gets there,’ and
the credit is McMahon’s”; (e) McMahon himself,
in “Lonesomelike,” “did well according to his lights
—which are the footlights.” And because of this
one drop of disapproval in a bucketful of eulogy I
am informed severely that, if I had a more inti-
mate knowledge of the Repertory Theatre (my
acquaintance with it dates back to its very inception,
and I have been present at every one of its 49 pro-
ductions, whereas McCrae’s association with it began
a few weeks ago), I would not have written my
“thoughtless criticism of one who not only is per-
haps the most versatile and intellectual actor Aus-
tralia has turned out, but is also,” etc. Was ever
critic more unjustly butchered to make a puff para-
graph? McCrae’s method of seeking to confute my
mildly-adverse criticism of McMahon in one play is
to mention six others in which, according to Hugh,
he showed himself to be a natural, convincing, in-
tellectual, versatile, etc., actor. Having had a
wider experience than Hugh of McMahon’s work, I
could without difficulty name a dozen or more
characters in which that mime, not to employ too
many adjectives, was excellent; but this does not
alter the fact that, like the late lamented Homer, he
is sometimes caught nodding. If a commentator
were to remark that Kipling’s “The Vampire” is
drivel, the statement would not be disproved by the
reply that “Mandalay” is a masterpiece. As for
Mediae's anxiety to show that the acting of himself
and his fellow-repertorians is characterised by “not
artlessness, but the art that conceals art,” I can
only observe that, while it is mildly diverting, it is
based on a misreading of my remarks. I did not
mention “artlessness” as a quality of Repertory act-
ing. What I said was that McMahon’s performance
in “Lonesotnelike” “belonged to the theatre, whereas
his supporting amateurs represented life in all its
engaging artlessness” —which is a very different thing-.
“Stargazer”: Many things weary me of
the drama of American make, but nothing
quite so much as the unashamed efforts of
the Yank dramatist to exploit business as
the true field of art. “A Pair of Sixes” is
another business play, one of many that
truckle to the idea that 20 per cent, is the
true interest of life. Once or twice authors
have even been so lost as to declare that the
business man is the ideal, the true hero, the
noblest work of God. Several Yank dramas
which are to come forward deal with dollar-
getters in this same spirit, and by the time
they have all been tried on the dingo Aus-
tralian managers should be moving back to
their old ground—the ground they preached
from when they were asked for artistic
plays and replied that playgoers don’t want
artistry on the stage; w T hat they want is to
get away from the heat and burden of the
day, the worry of business, and be refreshed
with joyous trifles. The man who would go
to an American play to escape business
would visit a fish market seeking fresh air.
When 'lda Barr, the mammoth contralto
of the Tivoli circuit, was singing one of her
most affecting serio ditties in Melbourne the
other night, a brute in the stalls took advan-
tage of an effective pause to ejaculate
earnestly: “Say, why haven’t you gone to
the Front?” Which reminds us that IS
English pantomime “dames” are fighting in
the Western theatre. The resulting dearth
of “dames” has compelled many British
managers to engage women for the part
this Christmas. Pantomime “boys” are still
numerous, however. Their tendency is
notoriously not to the front.
“Rab Cilbup”: Hell is paved with good
first acts. And the box-office of Hades is
roofed with bad third acts. A writer sug-
gests that the easiest way to get rid of the
difficulty of the third act is to omit the thing.
Finish with your climax and up with the
lights. The reason why the dramatist’s
climax comes at the end of the second-last
act _is merely traditional. The Greeks —the
ancient ones, not Constantine’s crowd —
always had a relapse from the dramatic
tension before the close of the play, simply
because it was necessary to get the chorus
out of the orchestra. The chorus could not
march out while the actors were in the
middle of their murders, and they could not
remain in full view after the play was over.
The same anti-climax was necessitated by
the construction of the Elizabethan stage.
Shakspeare had no curtain to ring down,
hence hef had to write a lot of talky-talk
while the battlefield of “Hamlet” or of
“Romeo and Juliet” was tidied up by the
ambulance supers. The modern curtain
enabled Ibsen to slam the door at the most
exciting moment. That is the best way to
deal with the troublesome last act —don’t
write it.
“Private Boxer” : The obvious reply to
“Mid-Channel” (B. 2/12/M5) is that the
premier theatrical firm never gives its audi-
ence a chance to cry stinking fish. I never
see a locally-manufactured play announced
on J.C.W. bill-boards —nor does anyone else.
Where other managements produce such
pieces the patriotic policy is rewarded with
bumper business.
London’s Drury Lane is owned by a co.
which showed a loss of £9542 for tiie past
year. There was no autumn drama in the
12 months; but in order not to break a still
longer tradition Old Drury is having its
gorgeous Christmas pantomime as usual —-
“Puss in Boots,” not done there since 1887.
“J.F.IL” : Alice Crawford, the handsome
Bendigo elocutionist, is in the newest Lon-
don play about naughty Charley. It is
“Mavourneen,” by Louis Napoleon Parker,
and produced by Sir Herbert Tree at His
Majesty’s, London —first rate as a pageant,
but rather poor as a play. Alice Crawford
plays Lady Castlemaine, the first favorite
in the Royal harem, and she gives some
glorious outbursts of anger and jealousy.
The bee with the worst sting is Lady Pat-
ricia O’Brien, the new and beautiful Irish
Maid of Honor. Lady Patricia was the
daughter of an impecunious Irish peer, who
wanted her to marry a wealthy elderly
squire, which she wouldn’t do. Instead she
dressed herself in boy’s clothes and fled to
London, where after a series of romantic
adventures she got a billet in the Royal
Palace. Charley of course thought she was
one more; but she wasn’t, so he gallantly
acknowledged himself beaten and arranged
a marriage with her true Irish sweetheart,
and made her friend Father O’Rafferty a
bishop.
“U.S.” rakes up mixed history -
Richardson and Leese were the first United States
Americans to settle in San Francisco. It was then
(1839) a little village under Mexican Government
called Yerba Buena. Leese married a sister of Mexi-
can General Vallejo. With the rush of 1848-9 the
“Hounds” developed. The ringleaders of these
ferocious larrikins came from the Sydney pushes, and
were therefore also called the Sydney Coves. Their
quarter was the notorious Sydney Town. Whither
the Sydney Coves had anything’ to do with it or not
there was much interchange of theatrical people
between San Francisco and Australia from 1849
onward. The first notable public show in ’Frisco
was. Rowe’s Olympic Circus, in 1849. Rowe after-
wards brought his establishment to Melbourne. Mr.
and Mrs. Hambleton were in the company which
Coppin carried to Melbourne from Launceston in
1845. They passed on to ’Frisco, and many years
afterwards Hambleton returned to Australia as a
preacher. Accompanying the flight of the Hamble-
tons from Sydney were Mr. and Mrs. Nesbitt M‘Cron
and Mr. and Mrs. Batters. Batters had been known
ns a person of unusual habits in Melbourne, where
he organised the amateur show which opened the
Queen’s Theatre; the next performances were by
Nesbitt M'Cron’s company—-“ The Bear-Hunters” and
“Black-E.veil Susan.” • ill', and Mrs. Stark were
favorite stars both in Australia and San Francisco.
J. L. livers, tragedian, was another botli-sider. J. H.
Vinson was known as stage-manager in ’Frisco and
lessee in Geelong. Others with a foot on each shore
were Mrs. Waller, Mrs. Sinclair, and Mr. and Mrs.
Chapman.
“F.S.”: Harald Colonna —in days of old
he answered to the name of Hal Cohen —has
taken his tenor voice and plump person front
London to U.S.A., where he is to sing leading-
roles in grand opera. The last time he sang
at Covent Garden, his present heiress-wife
fell in love with him and incidentally his
voice. It’s rather interesting to speculate
whether he will now upset the peace of
America !
At a recent meeting of the Melbourne
Uni Council a few arguments by Harrison
Moore, professor of law, were produced in
support of Scharf’s re-engagement as piano-
teacher at the Conservatorium. “The wife
and child,” according to Moore, “are of
course the persons who will suffer most
directly by Scharf’s loss of means of liveli-
hood.” One could feel more sympathy with
Scharf were it not for the fact that the
“child” in the case is qualified to wear
whiskers and earn his own living. Any-
how', Scharf, who w r as one of the late Mar-
shall Hall’s most faithful adherents, is
shooed off “in view of existing circum-
stances.”
: “All Women,” a new Cold Coun-
try revue, is being presented solely by the
skirted sex. The cast is composed of
women, and there are a business manageress,
a stage managerine, and a eonductorette.
Sybil Arundale, one of J.C.W.’s old panto,
“boys,” plays lead.
Oswald Stoll, the ex-Victorian who runs
the London Coliseum and a score of other
English variety palaces, is a very serious
student when he is not dealing with short-
skirted soubrettes and cross-talking comedi-
ans. Some years ago he published a learned
treatise on “The Philosophy of Herbert
Spencer.” This month he is bringing out a
profound disquisition on National Credit.
Hugh I). Mclntosh will now oblige with an
essay on “The Psychological Aspects of the
Pawnbroking Propensities of Australian
Premiers, with Some Observations on The
Esoteric Significance of the Early Hexa-
meters of George Iteid.”
“S.S.” : What is chiefly the matter with
the American farce, “A Pair of Sixes,” is
the fact that it is utterly lacking in the milk
of human suavity. Its sentiments are all
ugly, its situations based on pure nark, its
characters mean and merciless. There may
be fun in a fat man slithering on the hide
of a banana or a gob of soap; but if the
banana skin has been set by a vicious person
to entrap a stout citizen into cracking his
nut on the flagstones, the enterprise is
humorous only to people of ghoulish tem-
perament. That is why, when all is over,
you feel that the female characters should
be treated in the establishment recently pro-
vided for asphyxiating cats.
“C. Ockney”: There is a playwright in
England who apparently approves of the
present prevalence of Yankee pieces on the
London boards. That playwright (also a
novelist of parts and one-time editor of
The Would, on which journal he followed
William Archer as dramatic critic) is Cosmo
Hamilton. He imagines that the American
invasion means the break-up of “the per-
nicious actor-manager system” which he has
long been violently attacking. I hope he is
correct in his diagnosis, though I don’t think
he is. A month ago there were six leading
London West End houses staging plays
from the U.S.A.: The Duke of York’s
(“Romance”), Apollo (“The Only' Girl”),
Globe (“Peg o’ My Heart”), Prince of
Wales (“The Dummy”), Queen’s (“Potash
and Perlnmtter”), and Vaudeville (“Kick
In”). The Gaiety, too, is doing a piece
originally produced in the States, but of
English manufacture. These theatres are
nor run by actor-managers, or naturally
the Yankee-made dramas, having no male
star parts, would never have been produced.
The actor-managers survive, a fine, old
crusted conservative British institution. But
Anno Domini is beating them, not Uncle
Sam.
<i. !' *~*in Fiz” : It is not generally known that
“The Watch on the Rhine” was written by a
hard-up drug clerk, who, if he were alive
to-day, might be staggering about loaded
with iron crosses -and other ironmongery.
This chap, known as Max Schnecken-
burger, wrote the screed whilst working at
his job in Berne, Switzerland, in 1840. It
failed to get a hearing and the author died
nine years later. Carl Wilhelm, a com-
poser, stumbled on it years after and com-
posed music for it. It had a good test at
the celebration of the twenty-fifth birthday
of the Prussian Crown Prince (afterwards
Emperor William I.) in 1854. Then it was
completely forgotten for a decade, and was
only revived when taken up by the League
of German Singers in 1865. Gradually it
won popularity all through Germany and
became the marching song of the German
troops. Composer Wilhelm died in 1873
soon after the Imperial Government had
granted him a liberal pension for his “dis-
covery.”
“C. Ockney” : The late Willard when he
got to London certainly played “seconds”
to Wilson Barrett (his manager) as
“Cockaigne” says (B. 18/11/’l5), but did
he really “squelch” himself by so doing? I
should say not. Ilis new-style villainy was
the hit of every Barrett production. His
Clifford Armytage (“Lights o’ London”)
and his magnificent Spider (“Silver King”)
are remembered to this day. No newcomer
to the_ metropolitan boards ever had a bigger
following in my recollection. And the en-
gagement, as “Cockaigne” truly remarks,
“meant years”—long, successful runs such as
never occur nowadays in that class of work.
All this time Willard was probably saving
money and maturing his plans. When finally
he became an actor-manager he never looked
back. I never remember one of the tribe
who was so consistently successful. He was
able to retire years ago. Curiously enough,
although he had been associated with melo-
drama for so long, he made all his money out
of Barrie. “The Professor’s Love Story”
was the piece that did the trick.
THE TRAGEDY OF JONES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jones was a man of enthusiasms,
Who suffered from loud, applauding spasms.
lie wasn’t frigidly analytic,
So Chance made him a dramatic critic.
He laughed at most jokes, and he dealt out praise,
And roared or wept at all passable plays.
The. actors and managers loved him so
That his editor said he’d have to go.
Poor Jones was told that his work might do,
If he’d try to take a more jaundiced view,
!■ '
And niggle and nag and denounce and tear,
And never laugh loud in his critic's chair.
Rut Jones said his liver and heart were right—
That in life he took a sincere delight.
Then he gave up his job and went away,
Aqd they found a more bilious man that day.
And he niggled and nagged and blamed and cursed,
And did his vile best —otherwise his worst,
Till actors and managers were afraid.
Which proved to all critics he knew his trade.
For; the art of cheap critics, far and near,
Is fo be bilious and very severe.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for - emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

The\
Correct!
Feeding of
Infants
NO attempt to provide a
correct system for the
progressive feeding of
Infants was ever successfully
carried out until the ‘Allen-
burys’ series of Infants’ Foods
were introduced. So successful
have the ‘Allenburys’ Foods
Nos. I, 2 and 3 proved, that
whenever a child is denied the
privilege of the mother’s milk
they are indispensable. Gratifying evidence
of their remarkable value in the feeding
of infants from birth is constantly coming
to hand. The following is a copy of one
of many such voluntary letters received
from Medical Men, Nurses and Parents
resident in nearly all parts of the world.
A NURSE WRITES:
“I am pleased to say I have used your Foods 1,2 and 3 for the
last twenty years and have found none better. The
most delicate baby ever born I nursed and reared on the
Foods until he was 3 years old, and now he is 18 YEARS, and
a strong healthy boy nearly 6 leet high and as rosy as an
apple. You can make whatever use you like of this as I
should like your Foods and other things to be more used in
future, as instead of making fat alone they make
bone and muscle, which is what children need.
(Signed) NURSE DAVIE.
The practical results from a continually extending use of the
‘Allenburys’ Foods, prove beyond doubt that children thrive excep-
tionally well on them. Such children are healthy and well grown; the
flesh is firm, without excess of fat and the formation of bone is solid.

CHRONIC CONSTIPATION
RECTIFIED BY DR. MORSE’S INDIAN
ROOT PILLS, STATES BROOK YALE
RESIDENT.
•It is with pleasure aud gratitude that I
bear witness to the sterling qualities of Dr.
Morse s Indian Root Pills,” writes Mr. Jean
Baptiste Jouve, Green Street, Brookvale,
JN.b.W. “Four years ago I was a martyr
to chronic constipation and liver complaint
and took food only when absolutely neces-
sary, because of _ the griping pains and fits
of depression which followed every meal. I
consulted several doctors and tried many so-
called remedies in vain, before taking a
course of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Iheir effect was immediate, and I was de-
lighted to find that not only was my system
cleansed and strengthened, but the remedy
was a permanent one, for since taking the
original course I have had no return of the old
trouble. To-day lam able to do a hard day’s
work with as much vigor as men 20 years
younger than myself. I always have a
bottle of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills in
the house, and if I feel out of sorts know
that one or two doses will make me fit again.
The above is my unsolicited testimony,' and
you are at liberty to publish it in anv way
you may desire.”- —Advt.
POLITICAL
POINTS
Victoria is the only State in the Common-
wealth without a Scaffolding Act. Various
Governments have made many attempts to
l»as>s one, but the Fats have always managed
to insert some nullifying amendment. This
time they could find no fault with Peacock’s
lame little Bill, nor any valid excuse for giv-
ing rein to their obstructive habits, so they
amended it by insisting that the measure
should be administered, not by the Factories
Inspection branch, but by the municipalities.
As everybody knew what that meant the Bill
was sadly laid aside, and the builders’ em-
ployee will get his neck broken as before.
These dropped Bills cost the State tens of
thousands of pounds, and there is nothing to
show for the money except an increased stiff-
ness in the back of Fat and an occasional
workman’s widow toiling at the washtub.
“THE CLUTCHING HAND.”
Ihe S. Aus. Minister for Agriculture lias
** Australian trees to be planted over
Killjim’s grave in Gallipoli. This will give
us a chance, anyhow, of importing good
Australian hardwood 20 years hence.
The Sydney Marine Court looked at itself
the other day and remarked that it was on
a lee. shore. After considering the harbor
collision between the steam-lighter Azalea
and the State’s blue-metal steam-carrier
Kiama, in which the Azalea sank, it found
that it had no power to deal with the certifi-
cate of the master of the Kiama, because
that vessel belongs to the State; and it
could not deal with the man in charge of the
Azalea because he only held an engineer’s
certificate. So the Court merely said that
the fault lay with the Azalea, and apparently
it might just as well have said that it was
a fine morning, thank you.
Judas Iscariot, who kissed the Master at
the Feast, must regard himself as an ama-
teur at the business when he turns over
Hell’s files of the Age and reads these two
cables which appeared on October 29, 1910:
Kaiser at Brussels.
The visit of the Kaiser to King Albert came to an
end to-day. The longer it lasted the more cordial
was the reception given to the royal visitor by the
people of Brussels.
And;—•
Airships ih War.
Great activity is being displayed by Germany,
which has ordered the construction of 40 monoplanes
to be completed early next spring. Krupp’s works
at Essen are supplying six guns capable of throwing
shrapnel a height of 12,000 feet. It is intended to
use them against an enemy’s airships.
Some of Melbourne’s City Bumbles sud-
denly remembered that the gun might have a
second barrel. A little while ago they decided
to withdraw the insurance of their employees
from the State Office and give that concern
an eighth of the business, the other seven-
eighths going to private cos., in which some
of the Bumbles were interested. This caused
comment, and when the State office declined
the offer of the eighth they said it might
have a fourth. Before this w r as accepted, out-
side remarks had become more than insult-
ing, and by eight votes to seven the Council
decided to give the State office the whole
business, as before. The dreadful word, it
seems, had been passed round that the Gov-
ernment, in insisting that the public’s busi-
ness should be done by the public’s office,
might be persuaded to also insist, while it
was about it, on all business, fire included,
going the same way.
THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.
On Remembrance Day Mr. Julius Knight created a
lot of interest by offering for sale socks that he had
knitted himself. —News item.
PTOMAINE DOSSER : “’Ere y’are, lidy! Try
yer luck! Socks worn by Julius Knight
in 1891! O'ny sixpence a ticket!”
Tlie Defence Department lias discovered
now that there are in camp many men who
are not amenable to discipline, and they
will be discharged from service. At the start
it was every man and every shilling. Now
it is every shilling we don’t want, and every
man that isn’t too much bother for our
wretchedly-inefficient administration to train.
“Parthunga”: Ivangaroo-tail
sinews, much used by the med-
ical profession for ligatures,
sutures, etc., are unobtainable
in Australia unless imported
from N’York. For ten ten-inch
strands one has to pay ss. Gd.,
an average of s£d. each. Each
’roo tail contains some hundreds
of such strands, and all the
necessary preparation to fit
them for use is to sort them
into sizes. They are then
steeped in ether and exported,
some to the land of their origin where the
Helpless Idiot has to pay the above price for
them.
More of this “voluntary” humbug and
hypocrisy! Maoriland, having put some
questions to its adult males, discovered that
there were SOOO of military age, able-bodied
and without dependents, who would neither
serve with the colors nor offer to do anything
else for the nation. But instead of saying
that, Maoriland’s system being purely volun-
tary, these men had a complete right to re-
fuse to do anything, Russell, Minister for
Internal Affairs, flew off the handle, called
the eight thousand “ingrates,” and threatened
to publish their names. If he does, and if
the Courts do tlieir duty, as no doubt they
will the Minister will pay about £1,000,000
m libel damages. Even a Minister can’t
hold people up to ridicule and contempt for
doing what the law says they are entitled to
do. Why can’t we be manly and straight-
forward and dignified, instead of sneaking
round to get by devious means at the back-
door what we ought to demand boldly at the
front?
IN hat thieves some of these big patriots
are! Lloyd George told the House of Com-
mons the other evening that the Government
had already saved from 10 to 20 millions
sterling by taking over control of the metal
tiade and workshops. And Lloyd George’s
secretary mentioned one case in which the
vendors had been charging the nation £3O a
ton for a certain article and were compelled
to reduce the price to £2O when the firm’s
books were investigated, the reduction mean-
mg saving of five millions on “a single con-
tract in a very short time.” The war is a
wonderful education to those Tories who
have no commercial axe to grind. They are
beginning to recognise why Tiie Bulletin
spells it Pirate Enterprise.
The Ilolman Government’s eagerness to
start baking bread is understandable if
the story is true. Attorney-General Hall,
having bought a lot of high-priced foreign
wheat for which there was no demand, had
the stuff carted to the unused Darlinghurst
Gaol and stacked in the dungeons where
the condemned used to curse away his last
days. But a gent, one really has no use for
gaoled wheat which nobody wants to buy
when good Australian crops are waving in
every direction; so the Attorney-General,
ignoring his Government’s painful record of
business ’ experiments, heroically decided
to become a wigged baker and thus get the
stuff' out of quod.
•The. report of the Vic. Housing
Commission recently presented to the Vic.
1 arliament throws some heavy bricks at
several of the muncipal councils camped
«|ong the eastern side of Port Phillip Bay.
lhe Board of Health also gets a brick or
two, but these are not projected with so
much vigor as the others. The trouble is
over the housing evils that everybody knew
existed all along the bay side. About a
quarter of a century ago parties of tourists
began to go down for week-end and other
holidays, and were accustomed to camp on
the foreshore. It was not long before the
landholders began to see there was cash in
letting out wheat-bag allotments to the
campers. At first the holiday-makers re-
belled, but caved in when they found that in
many of the most favored spots the soil was
private property right down to the water’s
edge. Every year saw an increase in the
number of bayside visitors hunting for a few
feet of sand. Gradually the land was pegged
out m small lots and town sites were estab-
lished whereon citizens were packed as tight
as sparrows in a nest, with the inevitable
insanitary consequences. All the time this
was happening the wretched old Board of
Health did nothing but write futile notes to
certain local bodies; and the Commission
finds there was shocking neglect by the
councils (and the Dandenong Council in
particular) in overlooking the abominations
perpetrated by Propputy. Which is merely
one more reminder of what an insanitary
beast Propputy is and always has been.
Something else Australia can do! The
Prices Regulation Commission in South
Aus., after taking all sorts of evidence, has
found that Australian cement is “fully
equal to the very best imported brand,”
and is, moreover, “sold, as a rule, below the
landed cost of importations.” About 30,000
casks were imported during the past year;
but. “each of the two local companies is
adding largely to the capacity of its plant,
and production may before long be expected
to overtake the S. Aus. demand.” But of
course the demand ought to be about 15 times
greater than it is. In the highly-protected
“BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS.”
The United States Treasury has melted down
20,000,000 sovereigns, which had accumulated as the
result of British payments. The block of gold
weighs 200 tons, and measures 6ft. x 6ft. x 11in.
WOODROW: “And only the foundation-stone,
too!”
U.S.A. cement can be got almost anywhere
for a dollar a barrel, and at that figure the
consumption for sidewalks alone is enor-
mous—the cement path knocks' so-calied
asphalt clean out. Works on Yankee models
now in process of construction in the
Eastern States are expected to cut at least
33-J per cent, off the present cost of manu-
facture ; and that may reduce the selling
price and help to make the demand some-
thing like it should be.
When recently General Joffre was asked
about the early Gerhog atrocities in Bel-
gium he said that at the start of the war
the conduct of the enemy in Belgium was
very bad, but that the moment the Allies’
victory at the Marne showed the Germans
that they might be beaten, they dropped
their “frightfulness.” This knocks out the
peace crank’s favorite argument that pre-
parations for effective resistance breeds war
atrocities.
PERHAPS.
George Reid may enter British politics as an
active Imperialist.— Cable.
GEORGE: “Why not?”
“N.”: Re the Norton Griffiths aroma.
Only half the tale in regard to headquarters
staff has been told. Besides those whose
names were published a week or two ago a
number of public servants —more or less
highly qualified and similarly paid—have
been transferred to the Norton Griffiths “De-
partment.” Hence the syndicate or ring or
whatever it is is collecting its percentage on
the salaries paid to these public servants, as
well as on those of (he men s’pecially engaged
by the Norton Griffiths people. There seems
to be a rake-off at every point.
A traitorous section of Melbourne City
Council has been doing fine work for the Gas
Co. in fighting Atkins’s scheme for increasing
the number of municipal electric-light con-
sumers by offering to supply or finance instal-
lations on time-payment. Some aldermanic
creature of the competing private co. pumped
false “information” into the Age, to the effect
that the Council’s electrical engineer disfav-
ored the scheme, and that the electric-supply
committee would duly turn it down. As a
matter .of fact, the engineer reported in favor
of Atkins’s proposition and the committee
recommended it, and it will duly come to
pass. It therefore seems up to the Age to
sift its information a little more carefully.
A newspaper that professes Liberalism, and
sometimes says nasty things about the Gas
Co.’s monopoly, can’t afford to be fooled
into serving as the mouthpiece of Tory in-
trigue.
According to Catts, M.H.R., the Common-
wealth Ministry doesn’t let its right hand
know what its left hand is doing. On No-
vember .24 Defence Minister Pearce adopted
a recruiting scheme which two days later
reached the N. S. Wales Recruiting Com-
mittee, of which Catts is secretary. The
State Commandant was consulted and the
wheels were set in motion. But the Defence
Minister gathered up his suit-case and de-
parted for a rest the moment he had the
thing out of his hands; and Prime Minister
Hughes, thinking his colleague had neglected
the scheme or .left it for him. immediately
set to work and issued a new lot of instruc-
tions. The incident isn’t of any particular
moment in itself, but it indicates the way
things are done. If the enemy had just
landed,. say at the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
conflicting sets of instructions got out to the
various commanding officers, it might add a
trifle to the other difficulties of the under-
taking. A mob of half-trained troops, with
and without arms, and officered by men
who had only a moderate knowledge of the
game, sent forward on crooked railways with
broken gauges and with two sets of contra-
dictory instructions to follow, might save
Australia. And then again they might not.
TOO LATE!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The' footsteps of the Allies had been dogged by
the mocking spectre of Too Late. —Lloyd George.
AVe were a little late. The bell had rung
Before we realised the Belgian’s cry;
Then with heroic purpose forth we flung
Our splendid few to help the land to die.
AVe were a little late when Servia’s shriek
Of agony rang through the living world,
Her dauntless thousands, mad and hunger-weak,
Through the black passes of her mountains hurled.
AVe were a little late. The women died
AVatching their famished children’s awful eyes,
AVhile flames of red destruction far and wide
Ate up their bread beneath the darkened skies.
AVe were a little late. Our pity moved
Too slowly and the foeman struck too fast.
'l’lie agony of mangled Servia proved
No lesson learned of all the bitter past.
AV e were a little late. Oh, cruel, cold,
The wind sweeps o’er the remnants of our crime 1
AVeighted with sobs that scarce the world can hold
It cries “Ah, laggards, late the second time!”

Mr, ANDREW HODGE as Rev. John Storm in
“The Christian.”
EFFICIENCY is as much a matter of NERVE VITALITY as of mental capacity.
AMBITION counts for little if you lack the ability to do things—if your brain will not
respond to the demands made upon it —if you find it a drudgery to even attempt tasks which
others accomplish without fatigue.
SUCCESS depends largely upon nerve force. It does not necessarily follow because you are,
for the time being, lacking in self-confidence and resolution to win that you are naturally
one of life’s failures, it is more than likely that you are simply handicapped by want of vital
nerve energy, given which you will soon find yourself ranking among life’s successes.
MR. ANDREW HODGE, writing on December i, 1915, said:
“Success in Life is the ambition of all who aspire to the best citizenship. To
achieve success it is essentia! that one must be virile mentally and physically, that
he should have the courage of his convictions, and be fortified with an adequate
measure of will power. These essentials are impossible with a shattered nervous
system. For warding off nervous breakdown I can highly recommend KEAN’S
TONIC NERVE NUTS, the restorative powers of which I have personally experienced,
in contradistinction to the effects of using sedatives and stimulants.
“Yours faithfully, “ANDREW HODGE.”
YOUR DUTY TO YOURSELF is to see that your nerves—the fires and steam in the
engine of your bedy—are properly nourished, otherwise you will always be held back by an
enervated, worn-out brain and body.
THE MISTAKE MANY MAKE is that when they become subject to nervous headaches,
backaches, lassitude and other signals of nerve distress they start doping themselves with
sedatives, or putting “ginger” into themselves with stimulants. In either case the effect is
only temporary, and the reaction calls for more doping or more stimulating.
THE CORRECT THTNG when the nerves begin to go is to nourish arid replenish them —•
to food them with those lost elements which are the source of bodily and nervous strength.
This , may he accomplished by the use of Hcan’s Tonic Nerve Nuts, which restore mental and
physical vitality by purifying ar.d strengthening the whole nervous system.
HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS are obtainable from chemists and stores. The price is
3s. per bottle, containing ten days’ treatment; or six bottles for 17s. 3d. If they are not yet
procurable in your locality they may be'obtained by post from the sole manufacturer,

NOTIONS
-Llie hot air and the dope and all the rest
of it raged with great fury until Monday evening, and
then the principals climbed into the ring at Sydney
Stadium to settle the matter themselves—'Darcy
•and McGoorty. There was an immense crowd to
look on, perhaps 18,000, for since the historic scrap
between Burns and Massa Johnson no disturbance
had provoked greater interest in Australia than this
~f.? een t . h ° young Maitlander and the famous left-
hook specialist. The weight of each hovered between
rep^tm b '# and A lst ’ 01b -’ and both had a rousing
eceptiou from the crowd. Darcy sat easily conft
TWp 1 ™ hIS COrner> "’earing a wide, boyish grin.
griu 011 McGoorty’s dial, nor, as the
■i,,® 1 ° 1 Paragraph, sitting close to him, sized
at , 'e moment, any confidence in McGoorty’s
emt and it is not very far from truth to say that
the American went into the ring heavily burdened
l)| muuoiy of the walloping the youngster had given
Mm a couple of months ago in the same place. His
supporters professed themselves certain of his ability
to out the Australian. He himself knew better,
though the rapidity of his undoing was probably
nearly as great a surprise to him as it was to Darcy’s
corner. The lad’s mastery of McGoorty was abso-
lute fiom the first half-minute. He just over-
whelmed him—carried the fight to him with a
courage speed and certainty of execution that, in
view of the other’s unquestionable powers of bash
and endurance, were a revelation to everyone.
McGoorty was simply a chopping block. By the end
, it x d , 10lind be b ad been so horribly knocked
about that he was already an object of compassion,
in the fifth he was knocked clean off his feet for
nine, and then got up to take some more until the
protecting gong- let him reel to his seat in
the angle. In the eighth he went down before a
powerful right to the- jaw, staggered once more to
the perpendicular, beaten and almost helpless—and
then the towel, propelled by a merciful hand,
fluttered m to save him. It wasn’t a fight. It was
a massacre.
There were no beg-pardons about this affray.
Darcy led and McGoorty jumped in with the left to
the side of the head and a right to the bodv—both
good and hard. This visitation would have stag-
gered anyone else. All it did to Darcy was to rub
Ins grin off. As they parted from the mix-up he
clamped his teeth together and waded in to battle.
McGoorty tried the left again but found a glove
this time and one for himself on the left eye; went
into clinches, to get one in the ribs, another on the
ear, a third on the ribs again, and then a short-arm
upper-cut which lifted his head back suddenly. It
was Darcy’s round by a mile. McGoorty had only
accumulated a. mouthful of blood. And so it went
on. The left hook was a dismal failure—as it
always .must be when used on the retreat against a
man with a quicker and straighter punch—and when
it missed the consequences were painful. Then
McGoorty commenced seeking the shelter of the clinch
arid holding down Darcy’s right; but he mostly
couldn t keep it down, and then he suffered badly.
Darcy s great strength left the other at his mercy, and
strong, hard jolts to the chin and bangs on the
ears followed' one another like cracks of doom. After
four rounds of this McGoorty tried to box his enemy
and keep off. That had even worse consequences
than the other, and thus be became weakened and
demoralised, fighting without method or force, just
throwing a wild haymaker about occasionally, and
all the time on the run, bleeding and bruised, his
abdominal muscles heaving under the strain at the
end of each round as if he had just finished a 100yds.
sprint. Meanwhile Darcy had long ago found his
grin once more, and it stayed there. McGoorty
could neither bit him nor box him. It was an
unmarked Darcy who took the cheers of the multi-
tude. He had put up a remarkable performance.
The whisper had gone round that McGoorty was
tired or something on his first encounter with Darcy;
and Ikey Mo hearkened to this with the long ear of
credulity. Therefore Mkey fell in, up to his nerk.
At places where he does business most of him
were laying six to four and two to one on the
American; he even backed him to win inside 10.
Before the first round was over Ikey felt the world
slipping from under his feet. McGoorty for the
second time in his triumphant career was up against
a rival with whom he had positively no chance —who
outclassed him at every point of the game so abso-
lutely as to make him look a dub. Darcy’s treatment
of Jeff Smith, Clabby and McGoorty leaves no doubt
that as a claimant for the world’s middle-weight
championship he stands right in front, for with
none of these men could Gibbons, the Yankee star,
deal so emphatically as Darcy has done, even if he
could beat them at all. McGoorty’s passing from
the first flight was a sad thing for a sportsman to
see, because he has always been a clean performer
and generous to beaten men. The BulljEtht would
like to have heard him call down the goats who tried
to brand him as a voluntary quitter in his first try-
out with Darcy; but, then, business is business and
dope is dope, and there was a rare good house at the
second smite, and even if McGoortv didn’t warn
Ikey to keep clear of the soup—well, Ikey doesn’t
matter much, anvhow.

When, some months ago, Frank O’Con-
nor, called on at the last minute as a substitute for
another opponent matched against Ferdinand Qued-
reaux at Svdney Stadium, casually gave the French-
man a hiding he began to take on the appearance
of something good. Later on he dealt with TTughie
Mehegan and. looked better, so he was matched to
argue the . point at Melbourne on Monday' with . the
English boxer Delanev, who put Up a rugged, stress-
ful fight a couple of weeks ago with Herb McCoy.
And O’Connor clashed with Delaney so abruptly and
hit him so hard and so often and was so full of
more assault and battery that Delaney’s keeper hur-
riedly flung the wipe in when, the score stood at six.
Wherefore O’Connor looks better some more, and his
punch will be in great demand. This Delaney takes
a lot of beating.

The imported sire got another log-tip at
the concluding day of A.J.C. December meeting on
Monday, the winner of all the events but one being
by a strange nag, and the exception being an animal
foaled in another country. Also MacShortodds and
Co. had an enjoyable afternoon, only one pro-
nounced favorite hurrying up quick enough to get
there first.
There were two really good races—the rich
December Stakes,’ for two-year-olds, and the Sum-
mer Cup. The youngsters were a promising
lot, among them the bigh-prieed Dessert, winner
of the Nursery Handicap on the 18th; AValaroi, who
appropriated the Breeders’ Plate at Randwick in
October; and Dame Acre, winner of the Nursery
at W arwick Farm last month. The speedy-looking
Miss Tressadv, who had let her connection down
on the opening da}', was also in the bunch, and
carried a fair swag. It was to Dame Acre, how-
ever, that the punter mostly trusted his sovereign,
though on the weights it looked as if Dessert was
certain to beat her. She didn’t. Dame Acre won,
but she had a mighty lot of luck, for Wolaroi, who
had been detained opposite the Leger, came with
a late run and only failed to get up because the
winning-post was not a few strides further up the
course. Dessert ran like a duffer. Booth, who
trains the winner, has been on a good wicket with
his young ’uns this year. The December Stakes was
his seventh win.
The argument for possession of the £lOOO
or so attached to the Summer Cup was left in the
end to Foil (6st. 91b.), who, with 7st. 61b., had
only just been beaten by Flippant over a mile and
a quarter in the previous week, and the imported
Canzone (Ist. Sib.), winner of the Grandstand Han-
dicap, with Bst. Sib. The Queenslander Frasca was
burdened with most hopes; but Canzone had gal-
loped so kindly in his last race that he was in
strong demand at the shrine of Israel. Frasca never
showed up, but Canzone was there at the last with
Foil, and fought it out over the last couple of fur-
longs. It was a gruelling go, and as Canzone hoisted
the white flag and Foil stuck to his job it w r as
Canzone that didn’t win. This Summer Cup is in-
variably hard to pick. Since ’B5 the favorite has
only landed the cash six times. In 10 years the
punters' choice lias gone down plunk on nine occa-
sions. In the Flying the Linacre horse Delinaere,
a visitor from Bananaland, sped over the three-
quarter mile in such haste that the clock had only
time to register “13J,” which is merely a tick
outside the Randvvick record made by Soutline.
There were 13 other runners, and Carine (Malster—
I ield Rose) was the only one able to make a race
of it; but her neck wasn’t long enough.

No matter what else • happens, Sydney
“unregistered ’ racing clubs are looking forward to
making a crust for the coming year. Fixtures for
1916 make allowance for holding 72 meetings and
providing further excuses to dodge work or war for
those who follow the brute. And this is only a
branch of the horse-racing business which the Hol-
man Government fails to make pay a reasonable
amount in a totalisator tax.

uiid business with I key at 20 down to 10’s. Some of
the things done by the Westralian T.C. have a queer
look. For instance, in last Perth Cup the third

the club’s officials hoisted Snapcap’s number for third
and before the mistake was rectified 11 holders
of Chief Sec. place tickets tore them up and flung

“N.T.”: When Polska won the principal
event during the recent “benevolent” meeting at
Moonee Valley (Vic.) the bookmaker's gladly paid out
50 s to any scarce punter who happened to have the
right hieroglyphics on his ticket. Jim Scobie, owner
and trainer of the mare, is said to have had £2
on, “for the sake of the odds” ; but if the owner
risked only a mild two quid it’s a moral that pre-
cious little punters’ money went on the winner.
There were a dozen starters and plenty of cash for
the first three favorites—betting 4 to 1 bar two at
“e start. Two old battlers in Sylvanmore. and
Golden Point shared outsiderdom with Polska, the
longest price about any other being 15’s. When
these figures are considered in the light of past tote
experience it is evident that Jim Scobie didn’t get
anywhere near the true gambling value of his £2,
while the books must have had a gay time. Yet the
wowser believes this state of affairs "to he better for
Jhe soul of the community than honest machine
betting! But, of course, the wowser has never seen
Solomon in all his glory tearing up the air with
unholy joy after such successes as Polska’s.

If J. N. McGregor, the Melbourne steeple-

enemy shell the sensation ought to make him feel

Which broke and re-broke his collarbone, smashed his

he broke both collarbones and injured his spine; and

tiaily paralysed, as incurable: yet a short tinie
afterwards he won two steeplechases at Hawfc«s Bay

doubt or reason; but it is as a quick-mending artist
that he calls for special notice. As likely as not
he may defy the Turkish guns and finish at home on
a piece of banana-skin.
"Barcdo”: Records, is it? Well, how
about this?' Some years ago the nominations for the
Mossgiel (N.S.W.) races were disastrous; in each
of the six races only two horses (the same two)
accepted. On the morning before the great day one
of these nags triumphantly broke a leg, whereupon
the committee rushed itself into special session and
the Mossgiel races were over—postponed for 12
months. It was a pity, though, because I believe I
could have picked all the winners.

First-class cricket in Tasmania nowadays
is usually of the kind that appeals to a spectator
who would get heart-throbs out of a chess-match.
But the other Saturday East llobart put some real
ghiiger into a match against West Hobart and
knocked up 409 runs in just under four hours. The
hero of the day was K. Watt, who carried his bat
through for 210. Watt’s partnership with Dixon put
on 106 runs in 35 minutes, or three a minute and
one to spare.

‘"Perry”: Apropos of “J.D.’s” remarks
about the 1882 test match. I have always thought
England would have won if C. T. Studd had gone in
earlier, as he was at the top of his form. Grace
made an error in changing the order, and he after-
wards admitted it. When Peate, the Yorkshire
bowler, went in, England wanted nine runs to win,
and an old man just close to me dropped dead
from excitement. The body was carried into the
pavilion, and it was Grace who pronounced it a
corpse. The first ball Peate received from Spofforth
he got past square leg for two. The next knocked
the middle and leg stump out of the ground. It
took the crowd a few minutes to realise that Eng-
land had been beaten. Then suddenly a man jumped
over the _ ropes and made his way to the front of
the pavilion, and everyone followed. Every member
of the Australian team was called, and all had to
bow acknowledgments. Notwithstanding Spofforth’s
success, Grace told me that George Lohmann was
the best bowler he ever played against; but it
was after George had got him very cheaply in both
innings. He never liked to be given out 1.b.w., and in
taking guard would always stand well away from
the wicket and thereby impress the umpire. As a
matter of fact he came across his wicket a good
deal.

S. G. Smith, the English star, is playing
for the Ponsonbv Cricket Club in Auckland (M.L.).
In liis first match he didn’t do anything but dis-
appoint a big crowd that turned up to witness
miracles. But in his second game, against North
Shore, he was the whole team and waggon and the
dog behind the bar. When North Shore went to the
sticks the second time wanting 68 to avert an
innings defeat Smith appropriated the ball and the
opposition promptly vanished for 66, Smith captur-
ing five for 35. The hero then grabbed a bat, smacked
up 104 and gracefully retired with a firm grasp on
Ins mighty reputation.

Following the yell to eligibles to shoulder
a gun is the move to cut men o£ military age out
ol sport Last week Sydney Swimming Club pushed
of*, holding two events —“under 21” and “over
40 ; and as this sort of fever is contagious there’s
a possibility of many athletes being soon squeezed
out of the hunt for the trophies of peace.

“Wal” : Reading the tale of “C.11.N.” (B.
9/12/’lo) about the Huon Gulf canoe-journey reminds
me of a little experience of my own on the south
coast of British Papua last year. I was doing my
usual weary boat-patrol, and generally seeing that the
gentle native was not bursting unnecessary holes in
law and order. The south-east trade winds were
blowing like the Kaiser, and from Hula Point to
hapa Kapa was a mad stretch of some 20 miles of
heavy, breaking seas and scattered- coral reefs. It
was too tough a job for the whaler, so I took a
mat-sailed canoe and four boys. We hauled up the
canvas and got under way. We were across the 20
miles in less than four hours, but I still have a vivid
recollection of a waterlogged canoe, two men franti-
cally- bailing with clamshells, the third steering, and
Hie fourth—a small boy—clambering along the out-
rigger and belting in the pins that held it to the
canoe. It was a race against time, but we won by
about 400yds. swim to the village, the outrigger
finally coming adrift as we made the outer houses.
Take it from me, if you want excitement in your
sport you should try Papuan canoe-racing in a
heavy sea.

“Ringbolt”; Re the cause of the popu-
larity of surfing on the east coast of Australia (B.
16/12/’l5). The average sea-temperature (surface)
along this coast is, in summer, less than the average
air-temperature by about 14 degrees Kahr., but ex-
ceeds it in winter by about eight. The cold
northerly current of the South American west coast
becomes the southern stream of the Great Equatorial
(divided into two parts by a narrow easterly counter-
current), and this southern stream, when it reaches
the Malay Archipelago, divides in turn into two
branches, one of which—well warmed by its passage
through the tropics—turns down along the eastern
coast of Australia, ultimately getting- into Antarctic
regions, and so starting on the round-journey again.
E. L. Jones, one of Sydney’s crack lawn
tennis players, goes-to Egypt as Red Cross Commis-
smner to reHeve Adrian Knox, K.C. Jones’s mate
will be Norman Brookes, Australia’s champion, which
is something of a coincidence in its way, as there
seems no obvious connection between tennis and
comforts for soldiers.

McLoughlin, TJncle Sam’s tennis wonder,
continues to get it in the neck. For three years he
and Bundy had held the doubles championship of
Wilson s country, but Johnston and Griffen recently
t°ie it from them. The 19-year-old Johnston conse-
quently grabs both titles in his first season at big
tennis. the challengers crawled over everybody in
the eliminating tournament at Chicago and 'got some
fine training against such high-class stuff as Church
and Matthey and Williams and Washburn. Added to
this Johnston had his singles victory over McLoughlin
to lean on, and it was expected 'when he and his
mate headed hopefully for Noo Yark that they would
eat up the holders. And they did in a workmanlike
manner in three straight sets.

Sydney oarsmen are slowly getting into
khaki. On the professional side Alf Felton, Bill and
George Paddon and Fred Ford (who represent the best
ot the rising lights) have hung up their sculls; and
of amateurs nearly a hundred have gone in for new
clothes. Something worth a word or two is the record
ot the Ma State’s 1913 eight-oar crew, of whom
seven and coach George Gunning have pulled out for
glory in another sphere.

• when amateur rowers
in Tasmania were allowed to take open orders for
then- prizes and use them with very little restric-
tion some queer trophies were requisitioned. Still
even the hardened secretary of the Hobart Regatta
got a shock when a rower from the Huon sent in
an order for a coil of barbed wire.
* * * *
The Hobart Regatta, Tasmania’s biggest
aquatic event, is to come off for the 78th time on
January 25. Owing to the war the prize-list has
been cut down to £2OO, a big falling-away from the
£519 handed out in 1914. The surplus, if any, goes
to the patriotic funds.
* * * *
The 1916 Anniversary Regatta to be held
in Sydney on January 26 is to be a skeleton affair
of three sailing races and one rowing event. The
fixture has been arranged to preserve the continuity
of the function, which is the oldest in Australia, and
it is hoped to keep it alive until after the war. The
conflagration has, by the way, been too much for
the English Grand National Steeplechase. It is
dropped this year after running since ’4O.

George Border, who recently scooped the
Ma State cycling championships, mopped up both
scratch and big handicap events at the Hibernian
Sports at Sydney on Monday. Horder is a big, lump-
ing wonder as a cyclist, for he has been pedalling
after prizes for nearly a quarter-century, during
which time records for quarter-mile to 24 hours have
fallen to his legs. And he looks good enough to
keep up the strain. He even looks good enough to
go to the war. Under a system of national service
you would know, if he didn’t go, that there was just
cause or impediment; under the “voluntary” system
all you know is that he is a mighty fine athlete who
stays at home.

Professional cycling in Sydney is tottering
on the brink of the cavern into which Julius Caesar
tumbled. Recently N.S.IV. League of AVheelmen
made an effort to raise a benefit to “Teddy” Larkin’s
family. It yielded £lO. The officials could have
passed the hat around and gathered more than that,
and spent the hours with the best girl at Manly.
The public just now wants something more appetising
for lunch,than bike-racing.

An Australia v. Maori land Rugby match
was played at Lemnos Island during October while a
mob of fighting men from Gallipoli were being rested
there. The match took place on the beach, and
when it was over Billjim found the Maorilanders had
helped themselves to 11 tries while he had accumu-
lated 427 contusions and a severe scalp wound. But
the- team that won was a fairly good imitation of
something All Black, and was probably good enough
to play anything on earth. Anyhow this was some
ot it, with the rep. teams the men have decorated
mentioned in parentheses: Full-back: Murray (Auck-
land and North Island); three-quarters: Marks
(Otago), i Cutbill (Otago and M.L.), Bertrand
(Taranaki) ; live-eighths: Cameron (Taranaki), E.
Roberts (Wellington and M.L.) ; half-back: Wood
(Taranaki). Amongst the scrum-punchers were Tay-
lor (Taranaki and M.L.) and McNab (Auckland).
Received, the Dunlop Rubber Co.’s calen-
dar for 1910, which represents in popular form the
sentiment of some verses recently perpetrated by

Common sense begins to look for a method
m the madness of Henry Ford, the Arkangel of
Peace. He didn’t play his present game at the out-
set of the war. His Yankee firm gloried in bloated
sales of motor-cars to the belligerents for just as
long as the belligerents were buying them. But
when the war was found to be working wonders in
motor manufacture in Britain and elsewhere outside
of Murk a, the old man started on a new tack.
After doing* his little bit towards queering the flota-
tion of the Allies War Loan in U.S.A. he organised
Ins Peace Mission on business advt. lines. It has
the approval of Potsdam, and probably Potsdam is
financing it. Anyhow, it is essentially German in
its one-eyed view.

The Scythe last week gathered in that
fine old Sydney bowler, B. Widerstrom. “Widdy”
twice won the Ma State champion of champions title,
and during club ramblings won seven championships
with Redfern, Randwiclc and City. He was a
survivor of the ancients who began wheeling ’em up
for Glebe a quarter of a century ago.
Heard over tlie back-fence :
Did yer ever ’ear the likes? I know I ain’t no
saint, but I ’old me marriage lines, and ’m a
respectable married woman, anyway. But these
brazen hussies who haven’t no husband to go round
climbing on platforms and singing “I Didn’t Raise
My Son to be a Soldier”—somebody oug'ht to speak
to ’em. Raisin’ sons is a married woman’s job—
under Guv’ment license—and for single girls to go
about sing-ing of their goin’ wrong is nothin’ to
be proud of, I don’t think. The shamelessness or’
’ enl —-why, while some of ’em was a-singin’, one
of ’em stood on the platform with a soldier’s arm
around her waist. A nice piece of goods she must
be!


Why Suffer from Indigestion when My
Exercises Permanently
Cure It?
Indigestion is not caused by the food you eat. It
is purely the result of a stomach that has been
ill-used —that has been shamefully neglected—that has
been allowed to rust through the want of proper
exercise.
My Health Exercises for banishing indigestion
quickly build up and strengthen the muscles which
govern the stomach, and get every part of the body
in proper trim.
I Teach Physical Cuitur# by Post.
Head this report from one of my pupils:—
“I am exercising regularly, and am feeling-
much better in health already. One thing lam
pleased about, that is, losing indigestion, which
1 have had no signs of lat?ly. The exercises are
very easy to understand with the diagrams and
explanations. I do not regret taking the Course.”
What my Health Exercises have done for others

let, “Health and Strength from Self Culture,” which

fort, there is nothing to compare with your
preparation for foot trouble.”

“Rimu”: I had an argument with my
landlord one day when half the roof had
blown off. I maintained that his cot-
tage wasn’t a cottage in any good
sense until he put the top on again. He
affirmed that a cottage was still a cottage
and that the lease held good as long as there
was any of it left at all. I want somebody
to enlighten' me as to the legal aspect of
the case. Must a man still go on paying
rent for the remnant of what was once a
dwelling, or does liis liability cease when
there isn’t enough left to keep out the
weather ?

When the Rangitira swung out from Auck-
land (M.L.) early in December and headed
for Fogland she carried 00,000 boxes of
Maoriland butter. The stuff weighed 1500
tons, and was worth £210,000. This is the
biggest load of cow’s fat any single vessel
ever lifted from Loan Land, and represents a
great effort on the part of Cocky and Straw-
berry to keep the mortgage from the door.
“Dry Shave”: The three-card gentleman
Ims a new lurk. A street-seller’s collapsible
stand, a few cards of sleeve-links, some
sheets of blue paper, the soft voice of a
Premier on the cadge, a couple of decoy
cobbers, and the abundant mug form his
stock-in-trade. About a dozen of the cards
are screwed up into small bluepaper packets.
If a John Hop happens along these are for
sale. One packet, which tinkles when it is
shaken, is shuffled with the rest, and you are
invited to bet on picking it out. The shuffling
is so casual that it is quite obvious which is
the tinkling packet. The cobbers pick it out
and win. After a while a mug comes up at
the double, tries to pick it—and loses. The
modus operandi is dead easy. While the
decoys are betting the tinkling packet is at
its usual address; but as soon as the mug
chips in it is neatly held in the merchant’s
palm, and another packet, shaken with the
same hand, gets the credit of the tinkle com-
ing from the palmed packet. The non-
tinkler is then deposited most obviously in
the front stalls and the genuine tinkler is
dropped quietly half a dozen seats to the
rear. The mug, scenting easy money, makes
a grab, misses the ’bus and loses his quid.

“Merma” : You can take it from me that
neither “Jaques” (B. 11/11/T5) nor “Es-
meralda” (B. 9/12/M5) has discovered the
reason for coal shortages ex sailing vessels
in South American harbors. Four years in
the business there showed me perhaps more
vessels over than short. Loss overboard
doesn’t account for the weight of a cargo
leaping up. Tally clerks for both parties
check weights on board and still differ.
Skippers (principally Germans) will cheer-
fully fake the scales where supervision is
slack, while the unscrupulous consignee will
just as cheerfully instruct the native tally
clerks as to the outturn required. Somebody
must win, and the winner gets the difference
in weight. Coal is worth about 425. 6d. a
ton over yonder, and when an argument
breaks out my money goes on the consignee.
He understands the natives and tumbles
early to the game.

“The Oldest”: “Quidam” (B 9/12/M5),
talking of the big lot of bank-notes stolen in
the bushranging days, and supposed to be
still hidden in a limestone cave somewhere in
the Blue Mountains, smacks his lips, and
then wonders how the discoverer would
feel if it should turn out that the
bank which issued the notes had gone bung.
Curiously enough, more than one-half the
stolen notes actually were Oriental, and the
rest Joint Stock. Both those banks have dis-
appeared. One smashed; the other is merged
into the A.B.C. The sticking-up occurred
on the Bathorst-Sydney road, near the Big
Mill, about 16 miles from Bowenfels. Mr.
11. E. Kater, now M.L.C. and chairman of
the Colonial Sugar Co., was the clerk in
charge of the notes —£5000 worth. Some of
them were afterwards offered at Webb’s store
in Bathurst; the person offering them was
arrested, convicted and sentenced. The
A.J.S. offered £5OO for those unrecovered,
but even if the whisky keg were found it
is questionable if the A.B.C. would be liable
for the reward.
“S'zzle B.”: I know because I reported the
forage sales at Redfern (Sydney) Railway
Yards. A cocky at one of the river ports
delivered a couple of hundred bags of maize
at the wharf, consigned to Sydney, and wrote
telling the agent to sell at once and remit.
But the river bar shoaled in the meantime,
and the grain was left for another trip of
the steamer, weeks later. But that didn’t
matter. Cocky got a letter stating that tlie
corn had been received and asking him to
“herewith find cheque and sales account.”
Cocky, knowing what had happened to his
goods, chaperoned them to Sydney by the next
boat, and saw them sold. The stuff brought
sixpence per bushel more than the owner had
received. The agent got a shock. Cocky got
the balance. But when a pig-raiser allowed
25 porkers to miss their passage and got a
cheque for them, also an assurance that they
had “arrived,” he merely sent tlie animals on
to another agent and kept dead quiet.
THE NEW FLIGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bacon is leaving the country. —Daily press.
Long did vve sit in abject fear and dread,
Facing the ruin that must come some day,
For Capital, the daily papers said,
Had spread its golden wings to fly away;
And if it went its powers afar to spend,
We felt Australia’s chance was at an end.
We strained our gaze to watch the treasure go,
We trembled at the reason of its flight;
Reforms of various sorts had burst the show,
The papers said it, and it seemed all right;
But still the cash that longed to run away
Always appeared to change its mind and stay.
Now Capital grows steadfast to a point,
His flight is mentioned with a fitting smile,
Yet are the times a trifle out of joint,
For Bacon leaves us in the olden style.
The war-clouds darken and the days grow lean —
When they say Bacon, is it Fat they mean?

FISHERS BEAUTY PILLS for the
I IVFRmakf C 1 EAR COMPLEXIONS
What every woman wants.
It is no nse being well gowned if you
have a blotchy complexion.
A pimple on your nose takes away
your self-respect.
The being has to be born who can be
dignified and at the same time harbor
a pimple.
Your pleasure is gone because you
are thinking about it all the time.
You are wondering when it is going
to burst.
It is Nature’s signal that your blood
is out of order.
A course of Fisher’s Beauty Pills
for the liver will remove the pimple
and prevent others coming.
They go to the root of the trouble.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character ) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Ratepayer: Sorry data insufficient....
A.M. (Q.) : It doesn’t prove that the country doctors
were wrong. In dozens of cases like that the men
have been finally accepted, only to crumple up in
training and be discharged as medically unfit....
Bertha V.: Good try, but it doesn’t land its suit-
case on the doorstep.... F. V.C.: So much war verse
has been written that merely ordinary verse hasn’t
a chance. Yours lacks originality... .Angelina:
Slightly revised: —-
I didn’t raise my boy to be a soldier;
I haven’t got a wedding ring, you know;
I really cannot tell you how I raised him,
But I keep his little liver white as snow.
. ...M.C.: Sorry... .Godfrey G.: After listening
carefully we have decided that it isn’t calling for
print. .. .Colleen B.: Not effective.... Rothsay :
Don’t know the verses. .. .F.J. (Coogee): “Fever”
received. The basket is airy and will reduce the
temperature. .. .J.J.K.: Ho for the good old-
fashioned Christmas blood-curdler:—-
And who was it? (The Religious Editor offers a
prize of a hymn-book and a bottle of rum for first
correct answer received.) .... Bully B.: Your rhymed
denunciation of Newcastle lacks fire. .. . Jas. G.:
Unsuitable. .. . Squinx : Rather not, thanks. .. .
W.F.R.8.: Poem doesn’t sting... .C.8.R.: Extract
from your ultimatum or manifesto: “At present, I
am considering to write up a synopsis of a, say,
dramatic allegory on the present Great War.” Please
leave us out of your calculations. It sounds terrible.
... .C.R. (Melb.) : Deeply uninteresting. .. .Pat:
One line: “Down in the paddock the cattle are
strolling.” It’s an evening-dress .way of putting it.
Why not say “lounging” ?.... Ruth M. V.: Un-
suitable—more and more unsuitable as the years go
by. . . .Romney: A real eve-acher. Use a typewriter
next time.... One Tree Hill: Cut out pars and post
to accountant, giving page and date. Verses miss
narrowly.... Strikers and Shirkers: Cease fire!....
Archie N.: ’Poo rough and ready... .Wuk AV.: No.
. ...11.A.M.: The jingle is valueless here. ... V.K.:
You seem to be trying to burst into tears. What’s
your trouble?... .Greenstone: God bless you,
woman, that isn’t verse!.... Cane Grower: An export
tax on wool and hides might encourage the working-
up of the raw material in Australia. But to put an
export tax on meat would give employment to no
one. Tlie leg of mutton is the finished article. The
increased price of the property you mention is the
key to the problem of who in the end gets the differ-
ence in prices—the landlord. The remedy is taxation
of land values... . A.0.J.: “Strings” is spoiled by
the same old fog. What, for instance, does this
mean ?
The far horizon lies
So motionless and clear,
It seems some strange immensity
Has strung the atmosphere.
....Anne O’K.: It’s a pity the real is so often dull,
isn’t it?... .XY: Come on in here:—•
. ...J.S.P.: There were two artist Booths in these
parts. The one lately reported killed in Gallipoli
was an Englishman who had done a fair amount of
work for Punch before he dropped in at Sydney
looking for health and a crust... . 5.T.0.: Good
idea; thanks... .Ex-G.: Too long - for the fresh facts
disclosed Simpson S.: No; a Dutchman....
Grigg: Very well put. Glad to hear again....
C.G.M.: Hongkong is a Crown colony, ceded to
Britain by China in 1841. .. .Spec: Yes, he may be
a liar. But he’s a rattling good man for that job.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
11. W.: Too wiry and tiie gag is underproof....
H.E.S.: Kindergarten stuff.... N. Mcß.: What are
you trying to do—to print better than a machine?
....King: Don’t want it—. F.K.K. (Perth): It
cost us Bd. to get the wretched things out of the
P.M.G.’s clutches. The P.M.G. had all the best of
that deal.... A.J.8.: Too old and woolly for us.
. ...M.R.T.: We have no use for drawings that
have to be pasted over with labels to explain their
meaning.
If the history of the years following the
Napoleonic struggle is any guide to what
the condition of Europe will be immediately
after the hanging of the Kaiser, the foreign
market for Australian raw products is going
to be a bitterly cold one. The prospect is
enough to make anybody shudder who con-
templates Australia's interest bill. Aus-
tralia. of course pays interest with its pro-
ducts ; and when it has to send two frozen
sheep and two tons of copper to pay the bill
that is now met with one carcase of the
meat and one ton of the metal, the politicians
who piled up the debt on the very brink of
the precipice are not likely to get many
blessings. It: is this prospect that makes
Holman’s and Scaddan’s borrowings far more
unpardonable than borrowings would be if
the outlook was normal.
THE STRANGER.
The night was rent in angry scars,
By lightnings flashing, vaunting wrath,
And clouds were covering fast the Stars
While Wind was clearing fast her Path....
Around the cosy 'Tavern’s room,
Immersed in telling “Deeds of Fame,”
Strong men didst laugh impending Gloom
To hide its head in silent shame.
A knock; again; a rap, a moan?
Mine Host dost rush to open door,
....The men have fearful, silent grown,
The Wind still lashing forth its roar
Across the room a huddled form.
Didst stagger, groping wildly forth,
Unkempt, fearstricken, drear, forlorn,
’Twouldst seem, the Wild Mari from the North.
The poet is a gambler fierce.
lie writes his vital lay,
The toughened heart of man to pierce,
And sends it straight away,
.Tust as non-literary flats
Will post their dollars on to Tatt.’s.
The gambler’s lust flames up when he
Goes for his Bulletin,
And tracks each column down to see
If he has scored a win,
As punters feverishly run
To ascertain which horse has won.
No zealot at the poker school
Is more consumed with vice.
He casts his lines, poor rhyming fool,
As other men cast dice.
The lot austere he finds to be
A most infernal lottery !

IMPORTANT
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EL DENT A TOOTH PASTE is scientifi
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the rpouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

THE STATE SAVINGS BANK OF VICTORIA
HEAD OFFICE—ELIZABETH STREET, MELBOURNE.
ESTABLISHED 1841.
Guaranteed by the Government of Victoria.
FACILITIES FOR SOLDIERS.
ANY soldier who has a State Savings Bank Account may, before leaving- Victoria, sign a form author-
ising a relative (or other representative) to operate upon his account during his absence. These
forms are obtainable at any Branch, or at the Agencies at the Church of England Soldiers’ Institute
at the Military Camps BROADMEADOWS and SEYMOUR.
When giving the Defence Department directions regarding the allotment of his military pay, a
soldier may direct the authorities to lodge portion to his credit, every fortnight, in the State Savings
Bank. Interest will be allowed at the rate of 3J per cent, on the monthly balance.
A soldier having an account in this Bank may, on identification by a Commissioned Officer of the
A.1.F., withdraw money by cable at CAIRO, ALEXANDRIA and MALTA through the ANGLO-EGYP-
TIAN BANK at those places.
SOLDIERS IN ENGLAND requiring to withdraw money from their State Savings Bank Accounts
should apply to the AGENT-GENERAL FOR VICTORIA at Melbourne Place, Strand 1 , London W.C.,
and upon identification, payment of any amount will be niade by return cable free of exchange.
The accounts of soldiers and nurses may be transferred free of exchange to the Post Office Savings
Bank of the United Kingdom and may then be operated upon at any Post Office in England, Scotland or
Ireland.
Deposits in the State Savings Bank now exceed TWENTY-FIVE MILLION POUNDS, and (he
number of depositors has reached 726,203.

One of the four new railways submitted
to the Assembly—that from Orallo to Injune
Creek —represents one of the few experi-
ments made in Australia of sending the loco-
motive ahead of the selector. Neatly all the
country to be served is Crown land. As this
is now threatened with the pear curse the
enterprise is doubly important. Under big
holdings the pear soon gets a mastery ; only
the small man can fight it back. It is gener-
ally supposed that it is thereabouts the Gov-
ernment will try its returned-soldier settle-
ment scheme.
Could the prophetic vision pierce the soul
of 1916 it would see much gladness for the
Allies. Such is the New Year inspiration
of that glad spirit, King George IV. top-
notch Scotch. —Apvt.

IN BANANA LAND
How a curse was planted : —-
Though the Gores, of Yandilla, usually get all the
blame, there were other fools; and it seems pretty
clear now that the prickly-pear curse first reached
the Warwick district in 1848, from Talgai station,
where it was planted by Mr. Gammie. He got his
little bits of trouble from Sydney, where they were
strongly recommended for their fruit and use as a
hedge plant. The head stockman, J. Russell, after-
wards planted some leaves in his garden near Clifton.
Later on he saw that the vegetable was too bold in
habit, and rooting it out threw the plants over the
fence. There they broke into full gallop and have
been racing over the country ever since. But Yan-
dilla and Talgai were not the only offences, for the
Davidsons, on Canning Downs, invested in some
plants from a Sydney nurseryman and started them
off on the rampage with loving care and some
manure. To-day between 20 and 30 million acres
are infested, and new ground is collared at the rate
of nearly a million acres a year.
“Ilangan”: The drought is hanging on.
In many places the 1902 conditions have
been left far behind. Notice the following
table of wholesale prices:—
December, 1914. December, 1915.
Butter, cwt. .. 110 s. 1565.

The extra smart people say it is the war.
The Tory press swears daily that it is the
Labor party. The Labor party says it is
the curse of Denham coming home to roost.
Cocky, who knews, tells you not to argue
about the matter, but for Heaven’s sake to
go and sink a dam and grow something.
"Lagani-Namo”: Owing to the inexperi-
ence of the troops sent from Australia into
the tropical islands of the mid-Pacific, the
anopheles mosquitoes are banqueting and
overloading Billjim with malaria. But the
country shouldn’t be blamed for that. Had
the troops been educated into the importance
of always sleeping inside a mosquito net, and
had there been a supply of Koch’s fever
mixture available, there would have been no
accumulation of malignant malaria. An ad-
vertisement V Well, I intend it to be one.
Ihe writer is just one of the thousands scat-
tered all over tropical Australia and the
islands who are indebted to the late Dr
Koch, of Cairns (N.Q.), for immunity from
malaria. So efficacious and popular is this
febrifuge that the chemist who had the pre-
scription and exploited it after Koch’s death,
makes, probably, more money out it than any
other Queensland chemist takes through
general business. The committee of patholo-
gists appointed by the Commonwealth to
investigate the malady would not be wasting
time if they gave special consideration to this
mixture.
GENEROSITY.
BILL: They tell me this old Flint you’re working for is the worst nigger-driver in the
district.”
MIKE: “ Indeed, notv, Flint’s nothin’ av the sort. A generous, kindly man he is, so he
is. Sure, there’s niver a day hut he gives me 16 hours to get through me worrk in.”
The municipal log drafted by the A.W.U.
has caused a sinking sensation in the muni-
cipal bosom of Bananaland. When the case
was opened the other day the respondent
Bumbles filled up every inch of standing and
sitting room, and trickled over into the
passage way. Judge Dickson, staggered by
the response, pleaded with the delegates to get
to work and appoint representatives, or they
would never finish this side of Jordan.
Accordingly, Local Government begged a
couple of months to prepare the case, and
council meetings in the State now mostly
consist of opprobrious remarks about a
monster earmarked A.W.U.
The Queensland Opposition is likely to
lose its leader, as Tolmie, who was once
captain in a Downs regiment, has placed
his services at the disposal of the Defence
Department, and has been informed that he
may be needed any day. But that 15 stone
of Toowoomba “condition” will take some
training.
Adamson, one of Ryan’s colleagues, the
other day burbled the old lie that “one vol-
unteer is worth 10 pressed men.” Presum-
ably the British are volunteers and the
Germans are pressed men; and the non-
sense that 50,000 untrained British, picked
up haphazard, are equal to 5()0,000 trained
Germans, fitted into their right places, is
responsible for the present national humilia-
tion and the needless slaughter of thousands
of our most heroic sons and brothers. In
talking like this Adamson is being a tre-
mendous patriot, of course. Such a patriot,
in fact, that, if what he said carried any
weight, Germany would certainly subsidise
him to go on encouraging Britain and Aus-
tralia in the pestilential folly.
There are some honest Bungs, anyhow.
A drunk up Mackay way explained to the
local Bench that during his obfuscation
someone had lifted £2O from him; and the
Bench, being an upright man, sermonised at
great length. Next morning a local Bung
called at the police station and said that a
wandering dipso, had handed him £2O to
look after a couple of days before and
hadn’t turned up to claim it.
Jack Howe, whose records in hand-shear-
ing have never been beaten and never will
be now, has retired to a pub at Blackall.
The other day his son won a ballot for a
Ravensbourne pastoral block.
A man put a ghoulish proposition to a
presiding officer at Maryborough in the by-
election for Fisher’s old seat. After record-
ing his vote he casually remarked: “The
missus died a fortnight ago. Any chance of
gettin’ one in for her as a’ absent voter?”
“Mulga”: Re “Kobbi” (B. 9/12/T5) on
prickly-pear roots. Cactus roots do not
sucker. It is from the bulb, fruit and fallen
leaves that the new generation arises. The
length of the root is remarkable, especially
as it is hardly ever found more than two
or three inches below the surface. But to
grub the roots out is waste of time. They
rot away after the bulb has been extracted.
If they didn’t, all Bananaland would be by
this time tightly buttoned up in a pear over-
coat.
“I Didn’t Raise My Son to be a Soldier.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I didn’t raise my son to be a soldier,
< I want another’s boy to fight for me;
I'd rather know another’s heart is bleeding
That I may live in sweet security;
I don’t care if my neighbor sends a dozen
Provided of my brood there isn’t one
Who goes to face the shrapnel for his
mother —
I didn’t raise a soldier in my son.
I didn’t raise my son to be a soldier ;
I’d take the very notion as a slur
That I should rear a boy to go a-shooting—-
I’d rather breed a boy to be a cur ;
When pothers in the street are looking
whitely
Because they see the battle rolling dun,
My “bosom’s lord” is beating gay and
lightly,
I’m glad I’ve got a coward for a son.
And if the foe should level our defences.
And pour their spoilers in our little town,
And give the houses up to fire and pillage
With no respect for babe or woman’s
gown,
When I am rudely handled by the butchers,
And shrieks announce u The ravishing's
begun,”
M.v boy can lie concealed within a garret—
I’d never seek protection from my son.
The house where he was born may pass in
ashes,
Our little gods go up in smoke and flame,
But whosoever lifted hand to save them
I’m glad he didn’t bear my Johnny’s
name;
There’s blood in pools along the dusty high-
way,
And gallant boys are stiff beneath the
sun—
They died that havoc shouldn’t wander my
way,
I didn’t have a fighter for my son !
But if the troops return again triumphant,
With Vict’ry like an eagle on their crest,
I’ll sing in joy (and he wiir sing beside me) :
“We didn’t do our duty with the rest!”
We share, of course, the Freedom they have
gained us,
And glad are we of all the boys have won,
But as to risking him —Oh, no! my neigh-
bors,
I didn’t raise a soldier in my son!
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. December 25, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
It has been a breathless week, starting on
Monday with an entertainment at the
Stadium in aid of the Christmas Toy Fund
for soldiers and sailors’ kiddies. Lena
Hammond and her contralto and Mrs. Bob
Bell and her soprano were four pleasing
incidents of the evening. In between whiles
gentlemen sparred politely with one another.
His Ex. Goold-Adams was present, and
woke up when the boxing items came on.
The takings were about £65.
On Thursday night some 5000 under-12-
year-olds swooped down on the Exhibition
Hall. They were the kiddies of soldiers
and sailors on service. Mothers with babies
in their arms and others hanging to their
skirts arrived early and waited patiently.
Twelve trees were provided, and enough toys
to fill another 12 were piled on forms. There
was a clean sweep at the finish. The Gov-
ernor, Commander Curtis and Major Pendle-
bury talked. The Governor related a rude,
wicked story of George V., when that
monarch was a middy aboard the Canada.
Also, he placed both vice-regal thumbs to his
nose, in illustration of the manner in which
the depraved monarch greeted the back of
the then Governor of Jamaica. Some of the
ladies of the committee were so shaken that
they were quite unable to find the right toys
afterwards.
A. 11. Whittingham, M.L.C., has been
given the right to wear the glad rags of
Consular Agent for Italy in Queensland.
The kiddies at the Children’s Hospital had
their usual Christmas Tree on Friday after-
noon. On Saturday, about mid-day,
Turkey took possession of the General
Hospital and the Mater Miserjcordise,
where the wards were decorated. The
military ward at the General Hospital was
decked with ferocious bulldogs and fat kan-
garoos made of cardboard.
On Friday ladies in tricolor garments,
ladies in white, other ladies in garments that
were hazily reminiscent of Napoleon’s Old
Guard, sold holly and sweets in aid of the
French Red Cross. Some worthy soul
donated a case of French soaps and perfumes,
which also were sold in the same cause.
On Wednesday the men in the officers’
school of instruction entertained their female
relatives at a something extra in concerts,
with supper afterwards. Same night a big
affair was held at the Exhibition. Lieut.
Grant Hanlon looked after the arrangements,
and Daisy Jerome and her red curls were
an attraction.
The ladies in the Red Cross kitchen
worked overtime preparing extra tucker
for Christmas for the boys in the military
hospitals. The Red Cross people also
cooked the first number of their little maga-
zine and dished it up.
There was a mild sensation in one of the
military hospitals last week. A screaming
baby was discovered in a cot, and when a
search party rushed out to discover the
owner, a weeping female, who had been look-
ing for the infant all night, was found chas-
ing round after it. It appears that the
infant was left outside a shop in its pram,
and a slightly-elevated convalescent plucked
it from its pillow and took it back to the
hospital with him. And he kept it quiet ali
night without being discovered !
Heated discussions still rage in the City
Council as to whether mixed bathing shall
be allowed in the Municipal Baths. After
filling the Town Hall with hot air, the city
grandfathers have decided to leave things as
they are for the present, so that the mortal
sin of washing in company is to continue at
the Arthur-street baths.
Mrs. Elworthy, of Hamilton, married off
two members of her family this week. Dr.
R. Elworthy, her youngest son. undertook to
pay for clothes for Madge Stephen, a Sydnev
girl; and Vera, youngest daughter of the
Elworthies, and one of Brisbane’s prettiest
maids, is to darn Leopold Downey’s socks at
Jondowaie.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Moustaches.
“Practical Suggestions.”
To women who are annoyed by disfiguring
downy hair-growths a method of permanently
eradicating the same will come as a piece of
good news. For this purpose pure powdered
plieminol may be used. Almost any chemist
should be able to supply an ounce of this
drug. The recommended treatment is de-
signed not only to remove the disfiguring
growth instantly, leaving no trace, but also
to actually kill the hair roots without irritat-
ing the skin.
How to have Thick and
Pretty Hair.
“Home Talents.”
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved
in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair
brilliant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp
completely, and greatly stimulates the hair
growth. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the
chemist only in sealed 11b. packages, which
retail at lialf-a-crown. However, as this is
sufficient for twenty-five or thirty shampoos,
it really works out very cheaply in the end.
Blackheads, Oily Pores, etc.
A unique new method instantly removes and coireets
them.
The new sparkling face-bath treatment rids
the skin of blackheads, oiliness and enlarged
pores almost instantly. It is
harmless, pleasant and immediately diecti.ve.
All you have to do is to drop a stymol tablet,
obtained from the chemist’s, in a glass ot hot
water, and after the resulting effervescence
has subsided dab the affected portions ot the
face freely with the liquid. When you dry
the face you will find that the blackheads
come right off on the towel, the large pores
contract and efface themselves and the greasi-
ness is all gone, leaving the skin smooth, sott
and cool. This treatment should be repeated a
few times at intervals of several days in order
to make sure that the result shall be perma-
nent.
Grey Hair Unnecessary.
A simple, old-fashioned home-made lotion that will
restore the color of youth.
One need not resort to the very questionable
expedient of hair dye in order not to have
grey hair. The grey hair can easily be changed
back to a natural color in a few days tame
merely by the application of a simple, old-
fashioned and perfectly harmless home-made
lotion. Procure from your chemist an ounce
of tanimalite concentrate and mix it with four
ounces of bay rum. Apply this to the hair a
few times with a small sponge and you will
soon have the pleasure of seeing your grey
hair gradually darkening to the desired
shade. The lotion is pleasant, not sticky or
greasy, and does not injure the hair in any
way. [3

Victoria has two theological colleges. Two
students are being trained at one and three
at the other. It looks as though the bad
old stinking-Australian-fish policy of import-
ing parsons and giving them billets over the
humble if holy heads of mere Australians
is having definite results.
Truth has been infringing -fiction’s copy-
right again. A Bulletin yarn lately told
how Jim was seriously damaged while cut-
ting down the hanged body of Bill, which
fell on him. Now it has happened in reality
at Barilla (S.A.) —only Bill was a bullock.
The body fell on the man who was cutting
it down, and a projecting bone gashed his
face open to such an extent that seven
stitches were needed to sew it up again.
The Customs house, which faces every
oversea arrival at Sydney, is to undergo
large alterations, if not complete demoli-
tion. This will be the fourth change on
that spot. In the 30’s of last century the
Customs was in Argyle-street, and the build-
ing is there still, a part of the
Ai'gyle Bond. Governor Gipps thought that
the growing importance of the city deserved
a better house for these revenue raisers, and
he sanctioned the erection of one on re-
claimed gromia at the foot of what was then
old Government House grounds. It was
a very neat and substantial stone building
and was opened for business in 1844. That
was the first on the present site. It did not
occupy the whole frontage as does the
building of to-day. On the west side was a
weatherboard building let to various tenants
engaged in Customs-house business. One of
them was Mr. E. W. Moleswortli, who still
has a brass-plate near by. On the eastern side
was another shed devoted to the shipping of
sailors. This Customs house made way in
the ’Bo’s for the lower part of the present
building. In a few years the upper part
was added. It is said that the Federal Gov-
ernment casts longing eyes on the space in
front; but the public won’t stand the aliena-
tion of that. Many years ago, when in
office, John See proposed to build a drill hall
there at the instigation of some military
bird of passage ; but in the storm that fol-
lowed the suggestion was quietly dropped.
Tasmania is supposed to have splendid
fishing-grounds, but there is something wrong,
for fish is generally scarce and dear in the
towns, especially Hobart. When the State
Government observed this it was moved to
do something to break up the alleged fish
ring. So it appointed T. T. Flynn, professor
of biology at the local University, as a Com-
missioner, and sent him round to take evi-
dence at a good fat fee. Flynn has put in
about two months on the job and hopes to be
finished some time next year. In the pursuit
of knowledge he visited Sydney, where he
was greatly taken by Black’s fishshops and
State trawlers. According to the evidence
he got hold of, these things not only give
the citizens cheap fish but are a profitable'
investment. So the chances are he will
recommend his own Government to jump into
the fish business. Chief Secretary Ogden,
who is the Government’s fishing expert, has
always had a hankering for a State trawler,
so it is likely that, if the present Govern-
ment stays in power and can borrow the
money from somewhere, his Ex. Macartney
will have a chance to buy the first fish from a
State trawler. Ogden has an idea that the
now-deserted Port Davey would make a fine
base for operations on the West Coast,
and that the Government might start
a settlement there which would also serve
as a jumping-off place for prospectors and
miners.
The following is a near-enough transla-
tion of what will appear in to-morrow’s issue
of the Frankfurter Sauerkraut and a
dozen other German papers
Cabled advice from our principal spy in Sidnee, one
of the chief towns in Australia, states that on many
occasions recently the soldiers have mutinied to
shpw their disapproval of the war. Since the depar-
ture of their comrades in the first months of the war
these Australians have come to see the justice of
the German cause. It is most gratifying to us to
know that this is so, and to learn that nightly
attacks are made on Greek residents of Sidnee. We
understand that the favorite weapon of the Australian
Apache (blew mettle) * is being used and with
deadly effect. All Germany must feel elated to think
that our sympathisers in Australia are dealing it out
to these Greeks who gave the allied nations the right
to use their port of Salonika against the might of
Germany. It is most gratifying also to learn that
the few of our compatriots who have been interned
in Australia are being treated more as honored
guests than as spies and traitors. Disguise it as
we may, there is no doubt that sons of the Vater-
land, wherever they go, and however much they
prosper under foreign flags, always when opportunity
offers bite the hand that fed them. Strange as
it may seem, no other nation seems disposed to do
this, and the Greeks in Sidnee not only disapprove
of our methods, but would fight on the side of these
Australians. Wte can understand that the best
of the Australians went early to the Front, and have
mostly been killed. The mutineers now in Sidnee
have no desire to fight Germans even in Australia.
Possibly this is because they recognise that Herr
Wilhelm Hollweg disapproves of Germans in Aus-
tralia being treated otherwise than as the honorable
enemies they are. Our German friends in Australia
sincerely wish that they had Herr Hollweg in charge
of all military matters in place of the little man
they call Billieuse who is trying so hard to block
our good German products from entering Australia.
We are sure our readers will excuse us for writing
at such length on these matters, but the good news
of the revolution in Sidnee is worth even more space
than we have devoted to it.
[Since writing the above we have obtained some
first-hand information about the town of Sidnee. It
has a large population, mostly aldermen and poli-
ticians. Heavy taxes are paid by the few remaining
inhabitants, and the money so raised is spent in
keeping the friends of the aldermen and politicians
in elegance. The streets of the town are mostly
dirty and are all badly made. Our informant has
been there, and he says it is not desirable that any
of the citizens of our clean city of Frankfurt should
visit the place. Loafers and drunks may be
seen about the streets of the town at any hour of
the day or night, and the majority of those who are
not loafers and drunks are shareholders in the brew-
eries. Pony-racing is the favorite amusement of the
young men, but when our gallant armies triumph
our Most High will And different occupations for
them.]

No one can tell exactly what a headache portends. It may be
indigestion: the beginning of brain-fag, or worse, but the first
cause is always the same —a disorder of the blood vessels and
nerves in the head.
For immediate relief of the first cause take Chamberlain’s
Tablets for the stomach and liver. They act quickly on the stomach,
liver and bowels and relieve the whole blood system, thus letting
the nerves “down a peg” and giving rest to the brain.
You get up in the morning rested, refreshed, and filled with
healthy energy after taking

There is now no good reason why any
undeveloped or immature woman should
remain flat-chested and scraggy about the
neck, cheeks or shoulders. The lack of a
well-rounded, nicely-formed bust deprives a
woman of four-fifths of the charm that
would otherwise be hers.
Are your cheeks sunken and hollow i
Have you deep lines around your mouth
and eyes? Are your arms thin and scrawny?
And is your chest flat, and your bosom
undeveloped ? Do your shoulder-blades and
the “salt-cellars” that form at your throat
make evening dress almost a tragedy? Are
you so thin that your clothes merely hang-
on you? ?
DR. FALLIERE’S
FLESH-FOOD
is a scientific, harmless Bust Developer and
Flesh Builder. Put up in Tablet form, it
is easy to use and pleasant to take, and, if
desired, may be taken secretly. It is not a
common drug, but a skilfully prepared medi-
cated food-treatment. Taken under our
directions it will work wonders for your
appearance.
In many cases bust measurements have
been increased by over 10 inches, and the
gain in actual weight —equally distributed
over the body in generally deficient cases —
has been over five pounds weekly. Some
other cases have shown an increase in weight
of even a pound a day. The average bust
desired is-xabout six inches, and is readily
accomplished.
Guarantee given in every case accepted.

THE DAY OF THE EXPERT. To-day is the day of the expert—the man who knows every detail of his work
who is thorough, efficient and up'to date. The engineer who desires to reach the top of the. tree in his profession must
be conversant with every engineering method which makes for speed, complete craftsmanship, and for economy.
THE ENGINEER WHO DOES NOT KNOW of the Oxv-Acetylene process is not abreast of the times; he is
at big disadvantage, and leaves himself open to the charge of incompetence.
Throughout the world to-day the Oxy-Acetylcne process is the latest scientific addition to every engineering
workshop, which, fitted with this process, has an advantage over the opposition impossible to estimate. ' It is simple,
yet wonderfully effective; its price is trifling, and the plant is portable. Whether the broken parts require to be cut
or welded at the bench or by the roadside is of no consequence.
work of Iron or Steel welding or cutting can be carried out with Oxy-Acetylene. It is revolutionism
f tn . e Jii l^ l . nee ‘ an o trade. Broken parts that once were useless can now be successfully welded and made new
again tins too in the matter of minutes. Cost is a matter of pence as compared with the expenditure
or pounds hi-the old method of buying new parts and making new drawings and castings.
All Engineers should' at once write us for free catalogues and illustrations showing the remark-
able variety of work that can be done with Oxy-Acetylene. Following are a few of the broken
and worn machinery parts our process w ill make new again:—■
Cracked or broken Aluminium Crank or Gear Cases, Differential Boxes, Steering- Wheels Pipes
Cylinders, P lS tons, Cranks, Clutches, Cardan Shafts, Band Brakes, Worn Key ways in Shafts.
Pieces welded to broken Gears and New Teeth Cut, etc. '
Broken Machinery of any kind can be welded, including Cast Iron, Wrought Iron, Mild
Steel, Brass, Copper, Gun Metal, etc., which cannot be repaired by any other process.
The latest authoritative work on the subject, “A Practical Manual of
Autogenous Welding,” published by Charles Griffin & Co., London, states:
“Within the last few years welding by oxy-hydrogen and oxv-acetvlene blow-
pipes has been applied in thousands of workshops.” Those workshops which are
rapidly adding the process to their equipment include manufacturers, con-
tractors, machine shops, garages, blacksmiths, boilermakers, repair shops,
foundries, steel mills and railroad shops.

HI <;I[ tiny and lioliday shoes, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought, one feels, to hate
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostock range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the piclare to see
that here is something very smart and desirable.
Then think of it on. showing daintily, eaptivat-
ingly, beneath the flounced nr scalloped hem of
the summer gown. Nothing could 1)0 more appro-
priate or more charming. And with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

“Dalriada”: Evidently Browning had a
good deal to do with cablegrams in his time,
and was worried much by code mutilations,
as witness his remark: “A little Morse, and
how much it is; a little less, and what
worlds away!” For the modern cable-sub.
Morse and remorse are synonymous, as is
shown by the following extracts from the
war cables in the Argus and Age of
10/12/’l5. Says the Argus, referring to the
cold snap in the Balkans: —
The cold is intensive in Southern Serbia, and there
are piercing winds.
The ink actually freezes in fountain pens, and
eggs explode.
The Age not only refrains from the rash
assertion that the cold is "intensive,” but,
apparently regarding the pen as mightier
than the sword, considers it immune from
low temperatures; and reads the message
thus: —
The cold is intense, with piercing winds. It even
freezes the eggs of the mountain hens, which burst
with the cold.
Only those can realise war in all its horrors
who have seen a mountain hen bursting with
the cold.

“Kollo” (at Anzac) : lieferenee is made in
“The Inky Way” (B. 2/9/’l5) to the late
Pte. J. Gurry. Well, Gurry was a member
of the 4th Reinforcements for the 10th Bat-
talion, and was doing a fatigue job in
camp in Egypt when a draft of 3rd Rein-
forcements for his battalion marched past on
the way to entrain for the Front. “So-long,
boys,” he said ; “I'm off” —and tailed on to
the rear four of the draft. What excuses he
made for having no jacket-kit or equipment
is not known, but he reached the firing line a
few days before the May IS-19 Turkish
attack, in which he passed in his number.
Not satisfied with the field of fire obtained in
his fire “pozzy,” Gurry, with some two or
three others, had got out of their recess, and
lay down behind 5 a bank of excavated earth
in rear of their trench. While there Gurry
exposed himself too much in his eagerness t<>
shoot, and missing with one of his shots was
drilled through the head. “Joe” was the life
of his section on the march and in the tent;
those who heard him reciting Adam Lindsay
Gordon will never forget him.
Many newspaper offices employ writers of
tripe, but few admit it as candidly as the
one that advertised the other day that it
wanted a “Competent Trypist.”
* -H- -X- *
“Molecule” : Memories of Monty Grover's
Red Page story, “The Sub-editor's Dream,”
which dealt with the Day of Judgment from
a newspaper point of view, were revived in
the office of a Melbourne daily by tlie receipt
of a cable, “Lord dead.” “It's the end of
the world, sure enough,” said the news
editor. A hurried search revealed the fact
that there wasn't a line in the office morgue
dealing with the Deceased, and the Religious
Editor thought that an 18-column obituary
at least would be necessary, with a two-
column portrait and interviews with church
leaders. The cable expert wanted to know
whether he’d better run in a footnote saying
that the Kaiser would be in difficulties
owing to the death of his junior partner,
and the printer was told to hold space for
the views of The Times, which were momen-
tarily expected. Then arrived the cable
correction, which blew out the finest story
in the history of Australian journalism. It
made clear that the words "De La Warr”
had been omitted, and that all that would
be necessary was a brief personal announc-
ing the death of the peer of that name,
whose sole Australian interest was that he
had been Tom Brassey’s son-in-law.
*■ * * *
“Negatio”: Recently the Argus poked
laborious fun at a foolish deputation of
Scotchmen who asked Frank Tate, Vic.
Director of Education, not to give space in
the School Paper to verses or articles in
which appeared the word “England” when
Scotland was also implied. One line to
which exception was taken was “The bugles
of England are blowing o’er the sea.” Ap-
parently the MacParritches, with a truly
Scotch disregard of scansion, desired an
alteration to “The bugles of England and
Scotland are blowing o’er the sea.” Tate
quietly joshed them on behalf of the writer of
the verse, a Scotch College boy at present in
the Gallipoli trenches, and they rose up from
their hinterlands and withdrew. Then the
Argus poked borak at them; but it made
handsome amends a day or two later, when
it put up a heading on a cable dealing with
the fighting in the Cameroons: “Further
Anglo-British Successes.” The curse of
Scotland should now be abrogated.
THE PRESS PHOTOGRAPHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are photographers all over the place now. 1
could be “taken” 10 times a day. A mate of mine
named Sands was knocked over one morning last
week, only slightly hurt, but rendered unconscious
for a few minutes, and when he opened his eyes the
first thing he saw was a bloke snap-shotting him.
— Soldier’s letter.
The day was hot, the din of war
Was sundering the clouds ;
A vicious eastern sun shone o'er
A field of dust, and sweat, and gore,
And from the hillside crowds
Of blighted Turks were spitting lead
At aught suggestive of a head.
One comes protected by a charm,
With eager eyes for “snaps,”?
Ilis camera beneath his arm.
No gun is forged that can alarm
These photographic chaps,
For V.O. winners must be tracked,
And smartly taken in the act.
See one who comes through dangers grim
To where ten Turks are met :
He starts his camera to trim;
Now one fierce fooman jumps for him
With gleaming bav-o-net.
“Got back, you cow,” the artjst cries—
“ You're out of focus, Ma.-l your eyes!”

All Ladies Need
Laxo-Tonic
Pills.
The more delicate consti-
tution and finer organism
of woman makes it im-
perative that all the func-
tions of her system be
kept as far as possible in
a condition of normal and
healthy action, and any
diversion from the natural
order of things is quickly
followed by unplesant re-
sults. It is safe to say
that with nine women out
of every ten, chronic con-
stipation is the bane of
their existence, and can
frequently be traced as
the direct cause of many
of the more serious com-
plaints peculiar to the
sex. In all such cases
the use of nowerful and
irritating drugs is especi-
ally to be avoided, and for
this reason Laxo-Tonic
Pills are a marked im-
provement over the for-
mulae usually prescribed,
and are particularly
adapted to the use of
women in general; for
their action while
thorough, is always mild
and gentle. They stir
the liver to healthy action,
clear the blood, and give
tone and life to the entire
system.
Laxo-Tonic Pills can be
taken at all times, and
under all conditions, by
both young and old alike,
without the least risk and
without any danger ol
unpleasant after-effects.
Laxo-Tonic Pills assist the
process of Nature, give
relish to the food, and pre-
vent exhaustion, nausea,
sick headaches, and other
ailments to which women
are so accustomed. With
the girl, the young woman,
the mother, the middle-
aged woman, and the
woman of advanced years,
Laxo-Tonic Pills will
prove to be a most reli-
able friend.
ALL WOMEN GAN
BE BEAUTIFUL.
How to Obtain a Clear, Spotless Skin, a
Glow of Health and Bright Sparkling Eyes
Ask a woman what she most desires, and nine
out of ten will answer “Beauty.” Why she
wishes to be beautiful is in part for the sake
of charming others, but primarily for the
satisfaction in herself which she feels would
come with the possession of beauty. All
women can be beautiful if they but give to
their own bodies half the attention they donate
to their clothes. A clean, spotless skin, a
glow of health, clear and sparkling eyes, are
the attributes which will make any woman
beaut ful. First, to become healthy, Laxo-
Tonic Pills are the greatest and most import-
ant a;distance. By their regular use consti-
pation (that greatest foe of womanly beauty)
is banished. Better even than their cleansing
properties is the great tonic effect which they
exercise upon women whose delicate organs
need strengthening and toning to enable them
to cope with the strain of modern life. Old-
fashioned pills have a depressing and weak-
ening effect on the female organs, causing
troubles which rapidly deplete the strength.
The tonic effect of Laxo-Toilic Pills is to
create and build up, to send the fresh red
blood through the capillary system, renewing
all the waste tissues. Laxo-Tonic Pills first
cleanse the system, and then enrich the blood
and strengthen every organ. Become healthy
and vou’ll be happy, being happy you look
beautiful to yourself and to others. Laxo-
Tonic Pills can be taken at all times and
under all conditions by both young and old
alike, without the slighest risk and without
any damage or unpleasant after-effects.
LAXO-TONIG PILLS
JUST WHAT YOU NEED.
Laxo-Tonic Pills assist the processes of
Nature, give relish to the food, removing
exhaustion, sick headache, and many other
ailments. .
Anyone who takes Laxo-Tonic Pills the
moment she suspects her liver or bowels will
never have headache
There is no necessity when you take Laxo-
Tonic Pills to follow them up with nasty,
sickening, griping salts or castor oil, as you
should after taking calomel. Laxo-Tonic Pills
do not contain calomel or any other metallic
drugs. They are a purely vegetable com-
pound in a gelatine coating, easy to take, and
never gripe or cause weakness.
Thousands of neonle take one every night at
bedtime to prevent disorders of the liver,
constipation, bad breath, pimples and head-
ache. Try them for a week—take one on
retiring nightly.

The Cross.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ES Cross!
See it between my ’ands ’eld tenderly,
Still in its box, just as they brought
it me,
Silent, excep’ where two brave words emboss
Its dull-brown face; modest as ’im, my man
'Oo died to win it. The sergeant told me ’ow.
They blew a sap beneath the gully-brow,
Scrambled the parapet an’ linked an’ ran
Into the hailin’ clods an’ sand an’ smoke,
Sweepin’, with savage foot an’ searchin’
blade,
The jumbled crater that the mine ’ad made —
Cleared it, an’ lay to breathe! An’ then
there broke
'Ell from tne massed machine-guns. Back
again,
Droppin’ like flies, into the trench! Ard by
My man looked out an’ saw the sergeant lie;
Chambered, an’ crawled, an’ dragged ’im in;
an’ then —
’And on the parapet, an’ all but through—_
The murderin’ Maxims swept ’is breast in
two.
“A gap would take your wrist,” the sergeant
said,
When with ’ushed voice they came, an’ down-
bent ’ead,
Bearin’ ’is Cross !
My Cross!
“Take up your cross an’.foller, sister,” ’e,
The parson, said, in shakin’ ’ands with me;
The Paris-’atted ladies, plumes atoss,
’Oo stood beside ’im, talked to me of God,
’Oo moved in a mysterious way, they said,
Treadin’ in paths no ’uman foot ’ad trod,
An’ would not leave ’ls sheep
These griefs of ours was God’s great meltin’-
pot
W’erein ’E tried us; not a sparrer died
But ’E could put ’ls finger on the spot _
It dropped upon. An’ when I up an’ cried —
Though ’E should strike me blind, I could
not pray,
It was my man that God ’ad took away,
Not needin’ ’im as much as me—they drew
The easy-talkin’, red-faced parson through
The door, an’ went, an’ left me ’ere alone.
But this dear scrap o’ metal, an’ this rough
Bare-furnished, ’umble room we two ’ave
known
An’ loved in, will be company enough
Bearin’ my Cross!
You Cross!
Little an’ cheap an’ brown an’ never worn !
All of our gain you are —an’ all our loss !
Ours —me an’ It; ’is child as yet unborn !
O men, you range your world of grief an’
blood,
Prancin’ an’ eartless, battle-mad an’ blind,
Ravin’ of Christ an’ trampin’ ’im to mud !
What is your world to us you leave be’ind?
Our world is ’ere—blank walls an’ calloused
’ands,
An’ children-’aunted gutters; day, an’ then
The cruel night that ’ears an’ understands.
Turnin’ the knife within the wound again!
* #• * *
I know ’e died for Empire an’ the King ;
But night-times, with my empty arm across
’ls empty place, teachin’ my brain this thing
(Ivnowin’ my gold of livin’ run to dross),
I’ve thought, mayhap, it would not ’urt so
much
When It ’as come! —mayhap my ’eart
might rest,
If I but only once could see an’ touch.
’Ere, in the flesh, my own man’s livin’ breast
Bearin’ ’is Cross !

“Come, My Love, and Go with
Me.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Reverend Mr. Pennychoolc, north-
ward bound on the Arawatta, was so
enamored of the beauty of Whitsun-
day Passage that he began to quote the Book
of Job in its incidence to the wonders of the
Lord. He had been but a day on the
track of the 1200 miles of mill-pond calm
from Keppel Bay to Torres Strait; ordi-
narily a wretched sailor, in that heaven of
unbroken water, where the ship floated so
evenly that the gulls stood for hours flat-
footed on the jumper stay, he waited impa-
tiently for the gong that summoned him
to such lust of the flesh as cooks provide
for; hurrying to the saloon at the first sound
of the tocsin, and going steadily through the
menu from soup to nuts. After a meal, he
dozed an hour in his deck chair under the
awning—dozed a poor imitation of the slum-
ber of the blackfellow drugged with food.
Then for another hour he lazily drank the
beauty of it—the perfumed breath of a busli-
fire from the land, the sea scents of the dis-
tant, tide-bared reef, mingled with the odors
of towns that smelled as if they were made of
pineapples; the vision of the Mountains of
the Main, blue in haze; the lazy inner sea,
dead but for its tides, lipping the purple
islands; the sage-green water shining like a
shield under the sun, and by night a mobile
silver plane that bore the ship as placid as a
resting gull.
Before high noon the ship passed the
couchant lion shape of Pentecost; and there
and at Jesuit Point, the Cid and Orpheus
Isle and Miranda, the Rev. Mr. Pennychook
with some irrelevance quoted Job re Behe-
moth and Leviathans, the bands of Orion,
the Pleiades and the treasures of the snow.
It was in Whitsunday Passage that, as
he stood by the starboard rail, having left
his deck chair in sheer weariness of rest, he
was joined by Miss Spencer. She was
fleshed to a comfortable stoutness, her chin
beginning to ripple, 42 and comely with the
comeliness of the old maid in the rare Indian
summer which has never known a spring.
Mr Pennychook. who had wrestled with Pre-
destination. Faith. Works and the Demon
Alcohol until the drabness of life called for
a change—although he called it a. “rest-hour
for brain fag”—had been friendly with
Miss Spencer for a year, and had
regarded as Providential the coincidence
of their holiday and the surprise meet-
ing on the ship at Sydney. The at-
traction of the cheerful, fleshly lady for the
thin, sun-freckled, red-whiskered ascetic was
more physical than mental; alas ! Miss
Spencer was not orthodox. She was a
Christian Scientist, and lived by lecturing on
the non-existence of pain to audiences prone
to toothache, boils, hayfever and the gnaw-
ings of malassimilation.
‘‘You poor thing,” she had said to Mr.
Pennychook at Sydney—“no, Pm not on
holiday because Pm ill. I’m always well
and I’m going north to enjoy myself.”
“Mine is brain fag,” Mr. Pennychook said,
with the melancholy satisfaction that the
fag proved the brain.
“Nonsense!” replied Miss Spencer, with
cheerful rudeness. “There’s no such thing
as brain fag. There’s no ill in all the world
except bad thoughts.”
Mr. Pennychook eagerly disclaimed the
possession of bad thoughts; nevertheless,
two days out from Sydney, when he seemed
brighter at the sight of Brisbane River, she
insisted that the - bad thoughts must have
fallen overboard betwen Seal Rocks and
Moreton Light.
They were very good friends for all
their differences of shibboleths; and Mr.
Pennychook talked with her when not eat-
ing, dozing in the deck chair, or in his bath
Wallowing like a thin grampus, or sleeping
or quoting the Book of Job to the scenery.
Miss Spencer leaned on the starboard rail
by the side of Mr. Pennychook and
looked at the beauty of the great Stone
Lion of Whitsunday Passage laving liia
purple paws in the lettuce-green seas.
“Isn’t it beautiful, Mr. Pennychook V” she
said.
“Beautiful indeed!” replied Mr. Penny-
chook.
“It is all so beautiful because there have
been no bad thoughts there,” corrected Miss
Spencer, ignoring the fact that all that
beauty had seen piracy, slavery, sorcery,
cannibalism, tribal fights, battle, murder
and sudden death.
“I did not know the world could be so
beautiful,” said Mr. Pennychook, wisely
sidestepping the contest of Christian Science
versus Orthodoxy. “Since leaving Brisbane
I seem to have a new idea of what
beauty can be. My brain-fag must be dis-
appearing.”
“No, you have left that suburban parish
and its bad thoughts behind you.”
Mr. Pennychook opened his mouth to say
that his suburban parish had other products
than “bad thoughts,” but the fingers of the
light air of the Coral Sea were smoothing
out his wrinkles and he passed it by.
“At any rate,” he said gently, “I see the
change in myself. I happened to mention it
at lunch to the captain, and he said it was
owing to the higher temperature; the chief-
engineer said he defied anybody to go north
of Rockhampton and not* become human. I
scarcely understood, and he explained that
‘wowserism’ (by which I presume he meant
narrow-mindedness —though I confess I feel a
physical repulsion at the word) a sud-
den death 10 miles north of Keppel Bay.
However that may be—and it seemed a trifle
ribald then, though it is not so now —I am
better, much better, thank God!”
“I wonder if there are any people on these
islands, or whether all the beauty goes to
waste?”
“The chief-officer tells me there is a saw-
mill on one of those pine islands —the Cid,
I think he said.”
“Is pine wood all they produce?”
“I asked the second-officer —a wild young
man he is, I fear —I asked him if the natives
cultivated anything, and he replied”
Mr. Pennychook blushed furiously and
stopped short, concluding, “But I mustn’t
tell you that.”
The Christian Scientist forgot the differ-
entiation of good thoughts and bad thoughts;
she desired only to know all the thoughts of
Mr. Pennychook. Suspending the practice
of Christian Science she reverted to type—•
real woman, persuasive, warm, inquisitive,
confiding. She leaned closer to Mr. Penny-
chook. His thin body felt the atmosphere
of womanhood. Their elbows touched as
they leaned npon the rail, and Miss Spencer
said softly and seductively: me.”
Mr. Pennychook coughed. “Well —er —-
I don’t think I should give a lady his de-
scription of the manners and customs of
the natives, though the study of ethnology
is—er —highly interesting.”
“Do tell me,” begged Miss Spencer, nearer
and nearer.
“Well —er —then —I asked the second offi-
cer what the natives cultivated, and he
replied—er—he replied ‘Coeoanuts and —-
dear me—coeoanuts and polygamy.’ ”
“Coeoanuts and polyg”——repeated Miss
Spencer—“h—how wicked ! Oh !”
She left him not at all concerned with the
bad thoughts of the second mate. Looking
after her, Mr. Pennychook saw that her
ample shoulders were shaking. Then the
mercury climbed the thermometer a few
degrees, and Mr. Pennychook laughed too.
And thus they forged a mutual bond.
Mr. Pennychook asked her to walk ashore
during the six hours’ wait at Bowen. They
threw stones at the porcelain-blue soldier-
crabs marching and counter-marching—like
Broadmeadows mobilising for war. And
they bought mangoes and ate them together,
and further cemented their friendship with
sticky hands.
At sea again that night Mr. Pennychook
walked the deck With Miss Spencer, and
after she had retired he walked again and
thought thoughts leading nowhere in parti-
cular, but at least in a direction opposed to
Faith, Works, Predestination and the Book
of Job. He remembered the touch of elbow
on elbow at the rail; the naughty bond of
the second mate’s joke on the details of
island cultivation; the kindly weight of her
upon his arm as they reviewed the manoeu-
vres of the soldier crabs.
The Arawatta’s passengers awoke at the
anchorage off Townsville by Magnetic
Island. It was one of those steaming
mornings late in March, and the lighters
that were tugged out of Ross Creek to tran-
ship cargo from the Arawatta • sweated in
company with the sea. the sky and the ship.
Mr. Pennychook descended to the deck as
the greasy rain ceased, and the sun came
out to make Cleveland Bay and Magnetic

Zam
Buk
Comforts and
Heals—Soothes Swelling: & Aching:—and
Strengthens and Stimulates the Feet.
ZAM-BUK has proved a splendid remedy for foot troubles. When
the feet ache or smart, and feel hot, tired and swollen, wash
them in warm water, and then rub the soles, ankles and insteps
freely with Zam-Buk. As Zam-Buk’s potent, healing juices sink
through the skin they soothe the tissues, strengthen the tendons and
bring real “foot comfort.” Chafed and blistered parts are strengthened
or healed, and hard growths are softened. Zam-Buk comforts and
heals hot, swollen, sweating feet, galled spots, and takes away the pain
of corns and bunions. There is nothing so good for the feet as Zam-
Buk, the ideal soother and perfect healer.
Sore Heels and Tender Feet,
“Being an insurance traveller,” says Mr. W.
Sims, of 139 Tynte Street, North Adelaide,-
“1 am a lot on my feet, and very often
suffer from sore heels and tender feet. Upon
the application of your Zam-Buk Healing
Balm the soothing effect is wonderful, and in
a short time my heels are quite sound again.
I always have Zam-Buk in the house for the
use of my wife and children, in case of
burns, scalds, etc., and have great pleasure
in recommending it to fellow-sufferers.”
Burning Feet and Sore Insteps.
Mrs. Gunson, of 157 Hoddle Street, West
Richmond, Melbourne, writes: —“1 am a can-
vasser, and am, therefore, constantly on my
feet. My insteps became very tender anil
broke out in sores. 1 applied different lotions
procured from the chemist, but they utterly
failed to give me relief. Seeing- Zam-Buk
advertised, I procured a pot. Before I had
used half of it, the sores were all healed,
and the burning, irritating feeling had left
my feet.”
EVERYBODY’S EVER-READY SOOTHER AND HEALER,
Keep :i pot of Zam-Buk handy for sunburn, rashes, insect bites, prickly heat,
beat swellings, cuts, burns, bruises, dialings; sore legs, backs, ankles or feet;
pimples, eruptions, etc. Of all chemists, or post free from C. E. Fulford (Aus.)

Island a beautiful sort of Turkish-bath.
Miss Spencer leaned by tlie rail at the head
of tlie well-deck, and Mr. Pennyehook heard
of her before lie saw her. She had slightly
• raised her dress to clear the rain-soaked
deck, and Mr. Pennyehook heard a man in
the lighter far below calling to his mate
that here was a good chance for a prodigal.
His mate demanding the good chance to be
explained, the lighterman indicated Miss
Spencer as the owner of the fatted calf. Mr.
Pennyehook, following the glance of the
men, discovered Miss Spencer and saw a
very neat leg. and blushing turned his eye
away. Miss Spencer hearing the talk let her
skirt out to its length; but calmly, and quite
at ease, as one knowing the excellence of her
understanding. Then Mr. Pennyehook
looked again, and Miss Spencer met his
glance fully. He blushed again as he
joined her, and they moved from the rail
to the port side of the ship and farther aft.
There was a lighter working cargo from
the Arawatta’s after-hatch; looking down
at the grimy Titans toiling in that sweating
hold with sling and doghook, Mr. Penny-
ebook suddenly withdrew Miss Spencer from
an indecency—though it was only that the
lightermen worked navel-naked in that thick-
tasting and steaming air.
They talked constrainedly until eight
bells, often stopping tongue-tied in the
middle of a sentence never to be finished,
momently regarding one another with a
new interest, and momently turning away
ashamed. They were separated for break-
fast as usual, but after their ploughman’s
meal —for Miss Spencer was a good doer
too —Mr. Pennyehook sought her again as
if it were inevitable.
They sat under the boat deck, for again
rain fell; its splash and ripple in the
scuppers were dominant sounds, for the
winches had stopped and the lumpers were
smoking after breakfast. Suddenly from the
lighter in the greasy tide below a big, clear,
cheerful voice of a big man began to sing,
and all the lumpers were a chorus in
response:—-
Come, my love, and go with me.
The Chorus: Yes, my love, I'll meet you,
Meet you down in Tennessee.
The Chorus: Meet you by-and-bye,
Soon tlie parson he will come.
The Chorus: Yes, my love, I'll meet you.
Soon he’ll make two niggers one.
The Chorus: Meet you by-and-bye.
lloe the corn !
The Chorus: Hoe the corn, Moses,
Hoe the coni,
Mo.ses, hoe the corn !
Get away from my window,
My love and my dove,
Get away from my window,
Don’t you hear ! Oh, my !
Come some other night,
For there’s going to be a fight,
For the razors are a-flying in the air.
“They sing very nicely,” said Miss Spen-
cer awkwardly and with dry lips.
“Indeed, charming!" stammered Mr.
Pennyehook. “I —I think it very nice in-
deed. It is—ap-parently —a negro’s court-
ship song, judging by the line to the effect
that the parson will come practically imme-
diately. Hoeing the corn, Moses, shows
that they were agriculturists; but I depre-
cate the idea of razors.... And tlie day will
be beautiful. Will you not come ashore
now V”
“I’ll get my hat,” said Miss Spencer, add-
ing with unconscious plagiarism, “and meet
you by-and-bye.”
While he waited Mr. Pennyehook dis-
covered that he was thinking of Miss Spen-
cer deeply and not as a sister. His mind
told him, however, to “Tut! Tut!” and he
put the new idea resolutely from him.
Xhey went ashore silent with shyness,
scarcely able to look at one another, and
quite unable to refrain from looking.
Ashore Mr. Pennyehook hired a cab to
drive along tlie Strand. On the landward
side were eocoanut palms waving their
fronds through the heavy air ; the dumb sea
lay swooning on the beach: Magnetic
Island was purple in the sunlight.
“Our boat goes two-tliirty.” said Mr.
Pennyehook. “We’ll go back and sit on the
verandah of tlie hotel covered with the flam-
ing scarlet flower.”
On the balcony of the Queen’s Hotel, with
the reflection of the bougainvillaea deepening
Miss Spencer’s pink cheeks to a fired blush,
Mr. Pennyehook drank tea while waiting
for lunch, and schooled himself to look at
Miss Spencer with unfaltering gaze. And
by-and-bye they were looking at each other
almost in shame, yet unable to take their
eyes away. Mr. Pennyehook was about to
relieve the tension by stammering some
commonplace on the eternal subject of the
weather, when, shrieking with the joy of
distancing his pursuer, Eros ran from a
room on to the balcony. Eros was five years
old, naked and happy, followed by a black-
haired nurse who carried his clothes on her
arm and pursued the child to dress him.
He was one of those beautiful children a
decent man thanks God for—fair, yellow-
haired. violet-eyed, his face like a flower,
beauty enveloping him in aura, a skin of
sunlight, lips of tlie tint of Marvel of Peru.
He stopped between the chairs of Mr.
Pennyehook and Miss Spencer; his hair was
still damp from the bath, and in that
warmth bis splendid body despised the use
of clothes. He laughed loudly at distancing
the nurse. So exquisitely alive was he that
he hugged himself and trembled at the ecs-
tasy of breathing.
“Pete ! Come and be dressed !” said the
nurse.
“No!” shouted Pete; then, trying to
swear like a man, “Dash Heaven.”
“Oh, my boy .' my boy!” said Mr. Penny-
chook as the nurse executed a flank move-
ment to take the beauty prisoner.
“Ha! ha! ha!” laughed Peter, showing a
pomegranate of a month full of pearls.
“Dash Heaven.”
Miss Spencer put out a faltering hand
towards him; but the child, laughing, avoided
it, ran under her arm and down the length
of the long verandah, the sunlight gilding
his body—Eros in flight and the black-
liaired nurse in close pursuit. They watched
him until he disappeared laughing into a
room at the end of the verandah —whence
shrieks of disgust find rage told of his cap-
ture.
Miss Spencer’s gaze was fixed upon that
room as if she expected Eros to come back
again, and only Mr. Pennychook’s voice,
husky and faltering with passion, made her
look again at him to see the little man
transfigured. All the processes of love were
in the crucible, and a temperature of OS
Fahrenheit helped the smelting.
“Come, my love, and go with me!” stam-
mered Mr. Pennyc-hook from dry lips.
“Yes. my love, I’ll meet you,’’‘replied Miss
Spencer.
“Meet you down in Tennessee,’’ said Mr.
Pennychook, solemnly, and kissed her.
Miss Spencer swayed to his breast. It
was bony and uncomfortable, but the
Christian Scientist believed more than ever
that there is no such thing as pain.
"Meet you by-and-bye,’’ said Miss Spen-
cer. and put her mouth up to be kissed
again.
They were, as the .Tack Harkaway stories
used to put it, locked in a deadly embrace
when the bell rang for lunch.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The End of the Game.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FAR at. sea, in a spot where the Admir-
alty charts said the blue, rolling water
was two miles deep, an iron steamer
rolled and smoked on its way from nowhere
to somewhere or other. The blue arch of
Heaven leaned over the eternal ocean, and
the clean wind sang to both of them a thun-
dering saga which was incomprehensible but
appalling to the minor poet brooding alone
amid - the soots of the boat deck. The only
ignoble thing to be seen in the whole visible
scheme of creation was the silent little
steamer (now pitifully dwarfed) fussing on
its absurd errand.
Huddled inside the stuffy iron smoking-
room where they could not be stunned and
terrified by the thought-compelling immensi-
ties of Time and Space, a group of men-
travellers smoked and grunted and played
with ridiculous solemnity an imbecile game
with little glazed slips of colored pasteboard.
They called the madness “Bridge.”
The game (they called it a "game”) had
reached some sort of a toy crisis. It was the
fault of the very bald man—a curious being
who privately regarded the sacred rite of
Bridge as a mere device for killing spare time
without exertion, and, as such, unworthy the
undivided attention of a thinking human
being. He had heard the story about cards
having been invented for the amusement of a
mad king, and, what is more, believed it.
However, he was now in serious trouble.
The most obvious hints of his exasperated
partner had failed to reform his play ; appar-
ently oblivious of his small financial losses he
had muddled cheerfully along, occasionally
doing the right thing, but more often going
hideously wrong. At last, through his crimi-
nal inattention, he had committed some small
blunder which his partner looked upon as an
unforgivable sin.
“That finishes it! I won't play any
more!” The bald man’s partner threw down
his cards and stared murderously at the bald
man over the rim of his spectacles.
The bald man was—or pretended to be —-
mildly astonished. “Why, wliat's the
matter V”
The other players sat back grimly silent.
“Don’t you see what you’ve clone, .sir?”
This in the incurable card-player’s hectoring
manner.
“Dear me! Have I done anything
wrong?”
“Why, of course you have, sir !”
“Well, well!” sighed the innocent. With
bis hairless head and his eyes wide open he
looked curiously like a very wise old baby.
“Confound it all. you take it very coolly !
Don’t you see that you have absolutely
ruined the game? Don’t you see that ?”
“I'm very sorry indeed !” sighed the crimi-
nal.
“Pali! Why, / couldn’t have made the
mistake you did if I tried! Why”—lashing
himself into a fury—“l don’t believe you see
now what you did. Look here !” With
hands that trembled with passion he took
his own cards and the innocent’s and care-
fully demonstrated some insane intricacy in
the game while the smoking-room see-sawed
as if the sea regarded them all as babies in
a cradle and wanted to rock them to sleep.
“ Now do you see what you did?” The in-
tolerant card-juggler threw himself back in
his chair and fixed his patient partner with
the blazing eye of the bigot. He spoke as one
who was filled with holy zeal for the cause
of card-playing and was determined to bring
light to this placid savage who blinked so
disarmingly behind his spectacles. "Noio do
you see what you did?”
The poor card-playing heathen leant short-
sightedly over the cards and stirred them
with his finger. He seemed to be, in his
foolish way, admiring the bright dots and
streaks of color. “I think I do!” he mur-
mured at last.
“Ah-h!” Nothing could have been more
insulting than the instructor’s manner of
sucking in his breath. “Good ! Now do you
think you could tell me why you did it? You
must have had a reason for playing as you
did?” He cocked his head to one side and
awaited the reply.
“No-o, I don’t know exactly why I played
them that way!”
The cross-examiner chattered with rage.
“Good God, man, you must have had some
idea in the back of your head when you
played ! You didn’t just chuck your cards
down without looking at them, did you?”
More doubtful blinks. “Er—l sometimes
play that way, I’m afraid.”
“Pah !. .. . Now. look here ! Can you sug-
gest any reason why you should have dropped
that useless collection of cards on the table
in the way you did? What made you do it?”
(Dead silence.)
“Well,” sighed the delinquent at last, pass-
ing his hand thoughtfully over his billiard-
ball skull. “I can’t sa j exactly, mind you;
but I think it was due to ignorance compli-
cated by dandruff!”
And there Avas no more Bridge.
