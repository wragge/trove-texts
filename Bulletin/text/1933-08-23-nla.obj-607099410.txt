CHEMIST --'SAYS
“HEENZO is the best Family
Cough and Influenza Remedy.”
A WONDERFUL MONEY-SAVER.
A leading chemist advises parents to save
money by making their own family cough
remedy by simply adding concentrated
HEENZO to sweetened water. By doing
this you will have a supply equal in quan-
tity to eight ordinary-sized cough-mixture
bottles that would cost up to £l. HEENZO
is the ideal family cough remedy because
of its absolute purity and freedom from
narcotics. Therefore, it is a safe and good
remedy for even the youngest baby, as
well as adults. A bottle of concentrated
HEENZO will cost you 2/- at all leading
chemists and stores. Over one million
citizens annually prove the goodness and
economy of HEENZO as a speedy and
reliable remedy for banishing coughs, colds,
croup, bronchitis, influenza, and whooping
cough. Thrift is a .sign of wisdom. Buy
a bottle of HEENZO to-day, and have it
in the home for immediate use at the first
sign of chest and throat ailments.— Advt.

HIS BOOKS
Human Documents
The autobiographies reviewed below
are interesting, apart from the light they
throw on a number of celebrities, as in-
stancing how outlook may be modified
by environment. Both writers are late-
Victorians and English to the backbone
both began as schoolmasters, turned to
other professions and succeeded in them,
and threw off all trace of that didacticism
which clings to most ex-schoolmasters
till death.
Mr. Jose became a writer and gained
a high position on the “Times”; Mr.
Thorpe took to black-and-white and be-
came a “Punch” artist; both met most
of the wits of their period and are wits
themselves, and both have a gift for
friendship and no jealousies or rancors.
Mr. Jose is a product of Clifton and
Oxford ; Mr. Thorpe was educated in the
more democratic atmosphere of Ban-
croft’s School in the East End of Lon-
don. Yet Mr. Jose soon became too
radical for the “Times,” and Mr. Thorpe
is probably as conservative as anyone
who has been Connected with “Punch.”
A matter largely of the different lives
they have led. Mr. Jose has travelled
widely, and he has worked in South
Africa, India and Australia, sts well as
in Ehgland ; except for visits to France
Mr. Thorpe had not left his -native land
till four years ago, when he went for a
trip to America.
An Anglo-Australian
Arthur W. Jose’s The Romantic ’Nine-
ties (Angus and Robertson ; 6s.), in so
far as it deals with the ’nineties at all,
is concerned chiefly with Sydney. The
author arrived in Australia as a young
man, and soon made friends with the
local poets, artists and journalists of the
period. Lawson and Daley, Chris Bren-
nan and A. G. Stephens, Phil May,
“Hop,” Lambert, Souter and Julian Ash-
ton —he knew and admired them all.
Archibald was one of his idols, and he
was an upholder of The Bulletin from
its earliest days. He mentions that he
got a description of the new paper into
the “Times,” and a warm tribute to its
financial articles from St. Loe Strachey,
of the “Spectator.”
To have set the “Spectator” weeping on
the shoulder —sometimes I feel
that was the high-water mark of my career as
a journalist.
He says comparatively little about the
important part he played in making Eng-
lish officialdom understand the Austra-
lian attitude towards defence, and colored
labor 30 years ago. At the time in Syd-
ney and Melbourne clubland—-not to
mention London clubland—-it was black
disloyalty, as well as poisonous bad form,
to hint that a modern Australian fleet
might give better service, and be cheaper
in the long run, than the R.N. squadron
which had been holiday-making and
heiress-marrying in Australian waters
for so many years. The hostility to the
White Australia policy ■ was equally
strong.
When Jose became Australian corres-
pondent of the “Times” in 1904 Buckle
was editor and Moberly Bell was man-
ager—two Tories of the old colony-
spurning school. The outstanding advo-
cates of local defence and a White Aus-
tralia at the time werd the Labor leaders
Chris Watson and W. M. Hughes. Jose
knew them.
I happened to say that whatever we might
think of their politics no one could doubt their
sincerity. I whs promptly rebuked for partisan-
ship, and no more of my letters were published
for many weeks.
Yet inside four years a Governor-
General arrived with instructions from
Whitehall to look kindly on policies
which were still being condemned by
Conservatives in Australia; and the
R.A.N. materiafised in time to save Aus-
tralia’s capital cities and trade routes
during the World War. The efforts of
Arthur Jose and two or three other pub-
licists of British birth (The Bulletin’s
James Edmond,
a contributor to
the “National
Rev i e w,” was
among them)
helped greatly to
bring about the
change of heart in England.
The second half of The Romantic
’Nineties consists of fugitive essays.
They are amusing enough, but they have
nothing in particular to do with the ’nine-
ties or any other period. There is an
index. After referring to it, and draw-
ing blank once or twice, the reader will
discover to his surprise, and possibly to
his chagrin, that the names . belong to
the publishers’ authors.
Artist and Sportsman
The conservatism of James Thorpe,
author of Happy Days (Gerald Howe ;
12s. 6d.), is only to be discerned between
the lines; he rarely mentions politics.
But no Briton of his type and tastes has
ever been a Radical. He began life with
two ambitions—to get a drawing into
“Punch” and to play cricket for a county
—and he realised them both. He is one
of the thousands of now middle-aged
men who were inspired to become black-
and-white artists by the exquisitely
simple work of Phil May, and one of the
few who persevered and won fame with
styles of their own.
In 1897 he began attending classes at
Hatherley’s, the London art school,
where such men as Burne-Jones, Sickert
and Greiffenhagen studied when they
were young. He was lucky to have
begun his career in what he calls “the
great days of the ’nineties.” Photography
hadn’t arrived in journalism, and black-
and-white was being published for its
own sake. New illustrated weeklies were
constantly appearing, and though many
soon died they nearly all deserved to
live. “Pick-Me-Up,” “Table Talk,” even
“Scraps” contained work that would
make a modern editor’s mouth water ;
so did “Ally Sloper,” which lasted well
into the Edwardian era. “Punch” was
suffering an eclipse at the end of the
nineteenth century, and when irascible
little Harry Furniss left after a quarrel
with Burnand he had the audacity to
start an opposition paper under the fatu-
ous title “Lika Joko.” It failed almost
immediately, but that Furniss should
have been able to get backing for it is
sufficient proof of the interest the public
of those days took in pictorial humor.
Thorpe commenced as a commercial
artist—not such a profitable line then as
now—got stray commissions from week-
lies and dailies, and in 1909 had his first
drawing accepted by “Punch”—since
when he hasn’t looked back in a profes-
sional sense. The war interrupted his
career—he served in France with the
R.N.A.S. —but he has carried on much
as before since the Armistice.
- Happy Days is a charming book, and
no one but an Englishman could have
written it. More than half deals with
the author’s diversion^ —his club life, his
walking tours (with details of the lunches
and teas consumed), and, above all, the
cricket matches he played in and watched.
Much of the remainder consists of gos-
sip about people Thorpe has known, many
of whom, such as Oscar Asche, George
Lambert, Henry Fullwood and S. M. J.
Woods, were Australians. An odd
feature of the book is that, though
he has been a “Punch” artist for 23
years, and knew some members of the
staff long before that, he has nothing to
say of Burnand, Seaman or the present
editor.

Galilee
If the reader sometimes fancies that
he hears the voice of Sterne echoing
from the pages of Hector Bolitho’s Be-
side Galilee (Cobden-Sanderson ; 7s. 6d.),
he need feel no surprise. This book and
the “Sentimental Journey” are kindred
—each fashioned from the fabric of “a
slow and beautiful” pilgrimage; but
while the material of Sterne is eighteenth-
century brocade, rustling sometimes a
little wickedly and sententiously, Boli-
tho’s has a softer texture, a brighter

h
hue and the inevitable orange-blossom
scent of everything which comes out of
modern Palestine.
The process by which both authors
achieved expression, too, is akin. Their
common method of storing their raw
material consisted in lazing along in a
foreign country, far from the preoccu-
pations of everyday life, and letting their
minds flutter down on any flower of
thought which looked attractive and
flutter off again so soon as the scent of
it palled. Sometimes, of course, the mind
of Bolitho, like other hovering minds, is
taken unaware and becomes the prey
of the windy din of Moslem-Judaic poli-
tics, or is suddenly affronted by the sight
of a modern Jewish city, “incongruous,
ugly and passionate,” or is shocked by
the exploitation of religion for gain. It
is rarely, however, stunned into wonder
or drugged into overstatement or the
desire to indulge in “fine writing” which
afflicts the average traveller like measles
—makes his prose come out all over in
red spots.
Only once does our confident Maori-
land wanderer seem to find actuality a
little too much for his sense of propor-
tion —when Mussolini transcended for
him “such words as personality, force
and charm,” and sent him off thinking
that
... .a liar would feel sick in his belly if Mus-
solini looked at him very long One feels
that he would have Vesuvius removed if it
stood in his way.
Even II Duce holds the wayfarer only
for a moment, as do Judaic politics. He
prefers to linger with “the mountains
of Tiberias, color of dusty gold, color
of camels”; to breakfast on “orange juice,
toast and honey” beside Galilee after
having seen the place where the Gada-
rene swine went over the cliff; to drink
beer in a non-coms.’ mess in the desert;
to watch the night in Petra, and, above
all, to listen to the goatherds with their
pan-pipes:
a reed flute, playing on and on, from the
very birth of this country the same notes,
the same globules of silver, sometimes like
drops of water, sometimes like laughter one
fine exciting string of notes, stretching from
infinity to me.
This is a more polished, more compact
Bolitho. The young man’s prose is some-
times lovely and always unlabored. He has
learnt the art of detachment so that one
never has the feeling of being unplea-
santly involved in encountered contro-
versies or of being touched by prejudice
or by the Oriental nastiness which he
describes now and then. There is a dis-
cursive, dreamy quality about the book,
which does not destroy its clarity of
sight or the sense that, while the main
thread of the thought occasionally floats
away to M.L. or momentarily tangles
brandy and Vesuvian dawns together in
its mesh, it is spun as a congruous and
patterned whole. It is one of the best
travel books yet written b.y an Antipo-
dean —one to be kept on a shelf for re-
reading.
M.H.E.
The Self-Conscious Australian
M. G. Skipper prefers him that way :
“Australia,” says Isabel T. Hassall (R.P.
2/8/’33), “has had the misfortune to reach
adolescence at a time when the world was
growing self-conscious.” And, so far as 1 can
gather, she wants Australia to become smug,
in emulation of the grown-up world outside.
I hope it never will.
I meet a good many young men who are
turning towards Communism. Admittedly they
are somewhat trying to talk to. They believe
that revolution is a sovereign specific for every-
thing. But they are more interesting than the
ones who have become smug lawyers or
accountants. It is better for people to be more
sensitive than less sensitive; better to be
sensitive to external stimuli than to be com-
fortable as a cow is comfortable. One of
the consequences of the discomfort amongst
the younger generation is to put the older gen-
eration on their mettle. The effect of having to
justify their own system has forced the older
generation to think a bit about it, and as
soon as they start thinking about it they start
learning something. As a result of the general
frenzy of discussion they are beginning to know
something about their system instead of merely
accepting it as Heaven-sent and perfect.
A writer is often evolved because a man
has become aware of the confusion of his
thoughts, and has decided to bring order into
them. Demosthenes stammered, and that made
him unhappy, and in the process of overcoming
his disability he became an orator. As, inci-
dentally, did Hitler. A person who is happy
does not pursue happiness, any more than a
person who has caught a tram continues to run
after it. I hope Australian writers will con-
tinue to be self-conscious, because that means
they are not sure of themselves. And if they
are not sure of themselves they will want to
write better and better, and will at last become
sure of themselves. '
So does E. C. Mulvany:
Are we loutishly adolescent or merely pro-
vincially imitative? With a climate far superior
to that of Paris, Sydney still meets and eats
as though it were London or Edinburgh. Our
domestic architecture only ceased preparing
for snows that never came when it got a hint
from movies about California. We have
hardly become individual yet, much less adoles-
cent.
Consider some of the “grown-up” countries.
What is our “loutish adolescence” compared
with that of Nazi Germany, or our inter-State
pettiness alongside the turbulent jealousies of
Central Europe? Does any Australian vie with
the Englishman for insularity? Is America to
be classified as “grown-up”? What Australia
needs is more self-consciousness. Not the self-
consciousness of “loutish adolescence,” but
the sort that brings freedom from the blight
which the dead hand puts on the living present.
We must get rid of the phantasm that not only
our ancestry but our culture and habits are
conditioned by the older countries. Seeing a
happy Tyrolese family at dinner in the open
made me wonder, with some envy, when Aus-
tralians would cease to live like their great-
grandparents! We look to England for our
cue in almost everything and to America for
the rest. ,
A Nurse's Suggestion
In thousands of public hospitals all
over Australia there are no libraries, but
in bed after bed one can see the patients
soaking in overseas novels. Many of
these people never read fiction outside
hospitals. In a sick bed they have to
read something, and they would certainly
lap up good Australian fiction if any-
body put it in their way. Also a per-
centage would continue the practice after
leaving hospital.
A Hospital Library Society is badly
needed which for a yearly subscription
would keep Wards all over the Common-
wealth stocked with local fiction. When
you consider the thousands of public hos-
pitals the scheme begins to assume large
proportions. Most hospital boards would
gladly put money in it, and it would pay
local publishing firms to do the same.
Also to allow concessions on books pur-
chased. In this way the works of Aus-
tralian writers would always be avail-
able to the thousands who enter hospi-
tals year by year. And, believe me, sick
people get through an amazing amount
of reading.
L.A.S.
The Art of Freelancing
The gentle reprovals of the freelance
(R P. 32/7/’33 and 2/8/’33) serve to
indicate that some of the tribe require
a deuce of a lot of knock-backs before
they arrive. Here’s a copy of some
matter sent to me by the editor of
a prominent American magazine which
shows how knock-backs may be avoided,
in Australia as elsewhere:
(1) Simplicity and clearness are essential, for
they are both a requisite of good literature and
a surety that all who read will understand.
(2) Characters must seem like real people,
not mere names. The reader must believe it
happened.
(3) We want stories of action and adventure,
and we mean adventure in its broadest sense,
among almost any kind of people and in almost
any place.
(4) Our stories must be clean and wholesome,
but without preaching or moralising.
(5) We use fact articles, but very few. Your
chances are much better if you put your
material into fiction form. Autobiographical
material has almost no chance of acceptance.
(6) We always want good humorous stories.
(7) We don’t want: Problem stories, sex
stories, psychological stories, stories that glorify
crime, stories that couldn’t happen, supernatural
stories.
(8) We use a little poetry, mostly sixteen lines
or under. None of real length, unless they
are narrative with a real story in them.
(9) All manuscripts should be typewritten,
double spaced, on one side of paper only, with
left-hand margin of at least an inch. Name and
address on first page. Number the pages.
Enclose full return postage. Do not roll the
manuscript. Do not use typewriters that make
imperfect impressions.
(10) We have a specially warm welcome for
new writers who show promise—most of our
present contributors were new when they first
came to us.
If freelances with the requisite ability
follow at least some of these hints they
should soon be earning money.
WILKIE SCOTT.
The German Mind
The Red Page (16/8/’33) scarcely does
Germany justice in saying its people
“didn’t see anything comic in the Kaiser.”
There" is ample evidence to the contrary.
In pre-war days the Fatherland’s gaols
were never empty of literary and artistic
lampooners who had been guilty of
“chucking off” at the All-Highest
A perusal of old files of periodicals
like “Kladderadatsch,” “Fliegende Blat-
ter” or “Jugend” induces mild wonder
that the entire brotherhood of pen and
pencil were not behind the bars. A
famous instance is the cartoon of two
spectators in a picture gallery gazing at
a portrait of William the Silent with its
simple caption “How Different from the
Other One,” a performance which
brought the artist 12 months’ hard. Von
Bulow, who knew the Kaiser better than
most, constantly reiterates in his memoirs
that the War Lord was a never-ceasing
source of derisive comment among his
men of affairs, and even special inti-
mates like Phillip Eulenberg.
And then there is the added comment
that the headsman’s block is a reversion
to barbarism. It has long been the recog-
nised method of execution in many of
the German States, and would appear
to be less revolting than the manhand-
ling which immediately precedes a guil-
lotining or hanging.
ACHTUNG.
A Satchel of Books
A Manual of Library Routine, by W.
E. Doubleday (Allen and Unwin ; 10s.
6d.). A useful publication for librarians,
urban and rural, the world over. It is a
textbook on the standard practice fol-
lowed in organising and administering a
great public library such as that at Hamp-
stead. The author is chief librarian
at Hampstead and also lecturer in library
routine at University College, London.
The Story Atlas (Ivor Nicholson and
Watson; Robertson and Mullens; 31s.
6d. net). The geographical, racial and
social story of the world told in an in-
teresting fashion with bewilderingly
copious illustrations. Even the maps are
packed with information, and the histori-
cal section is so divided that such high-
lights as the ages of Pericles, of the Moors
in Spain and of the Elizabethans can be
seen in perspective against an illuminated
background. A fat volume that almost
deserves to rank as an encyclopaedia.
In Zest (Heinemann; Bs. 6d.), Charles
G. Norris presents his hero as a pre-war
stripling with a Biblical attitude towards
matrimony. Young Bob Gillespie, of
San Francisco, would have been calm
and happy with Solomon’s harem. But
he marries a girl he doesn’t really love,
and she doesn’t love him, so divorce is
waiting round the corner. In its train
enter the other ladies —Bella, the pas-
sionate ; Julia, the conventional; then
Bella again ; and it is Bella who is re-
sponsible for the note of tragedy on
which the book ends. The characters
are material-minded American middle-
class people. It has vivid and forceful
patches, no humor; and if made into a
talkie would no doubt repeat the success
of “Seed.”
Raymond Paton’s Autobiography of a
Blackguard (Angus and Robertson ; 65.)
is the story of an ill-starred genius. There
is a hint of supernatural influences which
is so intriguing that the reader feels
cheated when science explains away cer-
tain happenings towards the end. The
author manages the suggestion subtly;
and one of the best bits of writing is
the summoning of the presence from the
spirit world of the two drunkards, the
shivering little hero’s grandmother and
his violin master. Page by page the auto-
biography unfolds the character of one
who is a blackguard only in that he falls
short of his own great ideals. The writer
knows something of music, but he doesn’t
convey an impression of knowing much
about his princesses, dukes and suchlike.
J. B. Hobbs has written the book which
cricketers expect to get, and look like get-
ting in due course, from everyone who
toured' with Jardine. The Fight for the
Ashes, 1932-33, is its somewhat obvious
title. Harrap is the publisher and the
price is Bs. 6d. Most of it consists of the
same old photographs, scores, diagrams
and innings and reports of the play; but
there are some interesting and sensible
remarks about bodyline and barracking
towards the end. The chapter headed
“Review of the Tour” gives an insight
into a solid, judicial and altogether Eng-
lish mind.
A Rolling Stone of the Turf, by
Samuel Griffiths (Angus and Robert-
son ; 65.). Mr. Griffiths, who was for-
merly “Touchstone,” of the “Argus,” has
written the most absorbing book about
sport in Australia, S. Africa and India
that has come this reviewer’s way. He
has known everybody of consequence or
notoriety in the local racing and boxing
worlds during the past half-century, and
he has something amusing or instructive
to say about all of them. The only trace
of a slip occurs in a reference to one
of the exploits of Tarboe the card-
sharper. According to his story, Tarboe,
on a celebrated occasion in Australia,
dealt an opponent two pairs—kings and
queens. A confederate signalled that the
dealer also had two pairs.
A tremendous sum was at stake when the
show-down came. Imagine the sensation when
on the holder of the kings and queens laying
down his cards with a triumphant smile, Tarboe
showed a straight! With uncanny skill he
had exchanged his two inferior pairs for the
winning cards.
The commoner, and more credible, story
goes this way. Tarboe dealt his oppo-
nent aces and kings knowing that his own
hands were being signalled. What his
opponent didn’t know, and couldn’t
learn from his confederate, was that Tar-
boe also had aces and kings. On the
show-down Tarboe proved to have a
higher fifth card than the other, and he
collected the pool on it, drawing a revol-
ver, as described by Mr. Griffiths, when
the crowd threatened to rush him.
These reminiscences extend from the
seventies of last century to the death of
Phar Lap, and there isn't a dull page in
them.

THE PLANNING CRAZE.
It is cheering to see that, while other
countries are experimenting with cure-all
plans, Britain is steadfastly plugging
along on tried and trusted lines. All
these patent prosperity-bringers, from
the Five-Year (now Ten-Year) Plan to the
Blanket Plan, depend on the institution
of something like W. M. Hughes’s War
Precautions Act. That is where plans such
as Lang’s have an advantage ; like the
French plan of devaluating the franc by
four-fifths, and the German one of mak-
ing the mark virtually worthless, they
demand only fortitude on the part of the
Government’s creditors.
The Americans are getting some more
work out of the propaganda machin-
ery which was started when they
came into the war. In 1933, as
in 1917, those who won’t join up
have become shirkers. It is easy to
identify shirkers because the patriots
sport the national colors —swastikas,
eagles, sickles or whatever it may be.
At the moment nothing very horrible is
happening to the cold-footers of the
U.S.A.; they are merely being denounced
in speeches by politicians of the Roose-
velt camp and shunned by the respect-
able majority. Presently excitable girls,
inflamed with the conviction that they
are saving their natiye land, will begin
singing songs at the offenders and send-
ing them the equivalents of white
feathers. Later, if they go on refusing
to conform, patriotic hooligans will start
to deal with them. Later still they may
be interned, if only for their own pro-
tection.
In Russia anti-Planners are shot. In
Germany they are exiled, perhaps be-
headed, with the approval of the popu-
lace, or without any effective protests
from it. But America isn’t likely to go
that far.
The Blanket Plan is founded on the
old “Truck” Plan, which was spoken of
with respect by employers, as well as
by workers, when the U.S.A.’s war-time
and post-war booms were on. The idea
was that it paid employers to send wages
sky-high because the wages came back
to the shops. The endless chain of pros-
perity revolved to the satisfaction of
everybody till the end of 1929, when un-
foreseen forces interrupted its continuity.
All these bright schemes look as if they
are going to last for ever, and crash in
the end. When Roman armies were get-
ting gold from abroad without much
trouble 2000 years ago, it didn’t seem to
the average Roman that the era of wealth
would end, yet end it did as soon as
there were no more foreign nations to
rob. Similarly, when Australian politi-
cians were floating loan after loan
abroad it didn’t seem to the average
Australian that our era of easy wealth
would end.
The Blanket Plan is only another
attempt to get relatively easy money. The
Government will be on velvet so long
as it can keep the people at a white heat
of excitement. Investors will go short
of dividends without complaining, and
workers will toil overtime for nothing
with joy in their eyes, while the news-
papers praise them and vaudeville artists
sing at them. Then something will hap-
pen to undermine the national confi-
dence: the sudden conviction that the
sacrifices are to no purpose. This caused
the collapse behind the German front in
1918; it is threatening the Ten- (late
Five-) Year Plan now.
In countries that start Plans things
work out much as they do in wars in
nearly all respects. The shock troops,
the heroes who take the propaganda of
the politicians seriously, provide the
casualties: the cunning ones who are
ready with more or less plausible reasons
for staying out of the firing-line come off
best on the whole. They crowd to the
cities, go on the dole, beg, get odd jobs,
and as they increase in numbers their
political power increases.
The Planners are up against a con-
stant factor in human nature. A revi-
valist leader can often persuade a nation
to make sacrifices cheerfully for a time.
Lloyd George. Clemenceau, the Kaiser
and others did it during the war. But
there has to be a definite objective, the
attainment of which will bring an un-
natural state of affairs to an end and
provide a handsome dividend. The
Kaiser promised the Germans colonies,
and Lloyd George promised to make the
Germans pay for the war. The Plan-
ners can also make exciting promises,
but they have no more hope of making
planning pay than anybody has of mak-
ing a modern war pay, and the people
get to realise it after a while. The Rus-
sions have already been told, to all in-
tents and purposes, that they are doomed
to go on trying to lift themselves to pros-
perity by the seats of their trousers for
all time.
The British take a different line. They
don’t pretend that industry can be
re - established by recruiting - meeting
methods, or that a nation can prosper
by isolating itself. According to their
theory, man was born competitive. It
isn’t in him to work indefinitely for an
absurdly-named abstraction —a Blanket
Plan, for example. The British way in
times of depression has always been to
plod on without recourse to revolutions
or economic stunts; to work a little
harder and a little more efficiently than
the opposition, and turn out a better
article; to spend a little less, save a little
more and pay debts. It has been the
only sure recipe for industrial recoveries
in the past, and humanity is the same
now as it always was.
FORTUNE.
Barrack-street, Sydney, has seen a lot
of crowds and a lot of greed in its time.
It knew redcoats and bottle noses in the
days when Australia was young and the
officers of the N. S. Wales Corps traded
in rum. It saw the run on the Savings
Bank in ’93. It has been trodden by
every profiteer who ever sported a silk
hat in the mother of Australian cities;
but never has it faced the sort of experi-
ence which it is going through now. It
has become a street of adventure, with
its temple in the shell of a defunct soft-
goods house and its priests strung out
along 50 yards of pavement and besieged
by a milling mob of devotees.
At first its scene looks to the stranger
like a riot. Old men and young women,
young men and old women, mothers with
babies and ladies who dispense with them
jostle uniformed tram-conductors and
ragged unemployed in a struggle to get
into the building on the corner of York-
street where a solemn Treasury official
presides over Mr. Weaver’s lottery.
But if there is a mill on the steps it
is a struggle inside. You have to fight
for a place at the writing-tables round
the walls. Dozens squeeze and jamb in
the whirling queues which besiege the
grilles, behind which girls with unsmil-
ing faces write feverishly.
Australian crowds, as a ruie, laugh
easily ; but there is no laughter here. You
see decent countenances lit with expres-
sions that you would rather not see on
them. You see people whom you would
expect to be courteous by nature behav-
ing as if they were in a football scrum.
You see a lady with her hat ever one
eye engaged in a silent pushing match
with a waterside loafer for a position
at a window where they are selling num-
bers which, for some special reason, are
supposed to be lucky. You see staid,
sober persons decked out in lucky sham-
rocks ; and up the stairs which lead to
the “bulk sales” tramp well-dressed mag-
nates of the business—horoscope-mongers,
Lucky Bills and Lucky Adolphuses—to
take away tickets in suitcase loads.
There is, however, one spot of quiet
on the second floor, an oasis in which
one may escape the din and the greed
and find perfect peace. It is labelled
“Prize Money Paid Here.” Eight hun-
dred and fourteen prizes won on 100,000
tickets isn’t many. To-day, apparently,
nobody is collecting prizes.
It is hard when you think of it and
see the fighting mob of hungry humans
to believe in luck. Your scepticism calls
for demonstration that fortune has its
favorites. If they are not found at
the prize window a short walk in the
open air will show them to you.
Observe, for instance, a person fami-
liar for years as the persuasive centre of
a little crowd squeezed into the neck of
some lane in which he sold sixpenny hos-
pital “art-union” tickets —sold them out
of a barrel with the aid of a wretched
rabbit and a panting blue-tongue lizard.
Passers-by used to say they felt sorry
for him. No need to be any longer. The
lottery has brought him luck. He has
a Chinese temple staffed with Chinese
girls, the Chinese flag exposed outside
as an evidence of good faith, and half
a dozen spruikers assuring everybody
within a hundred yards’ range that “syn-
dicates close every three minutes.” He
has “won first and second prizes in the
Irish sweeps,” and why shouldn't he
have? Hasn't he a wheel which tells
his customers, rather creakily, their lucky
numbers —which are his, of course, too,
since he gets a gross profit of about
Is. 9d. on every ticket he sells.
All numbers are his lucky ones, and
he seems to share them with his neigh-
bor, Mr. Whiddon. It is easy to see the
barrel which the State lottery employees
presented to Mr. Whiddon, because he
has it in his window. It is easy to learn
all about him, because the gorgeously-
apparelled bellboy at his door hands you
a green leaflet which says:
WHIDDON
Ex-Commissioner of Taxation and late Director
of N. S. Wales State Lottery.
One shilling seventh share syndicates a specialty
.... Payment of winning shares absolutely .net.
But to see Mr. Whiddon himself you
need to be a centre-forward. There he
is at last —behind a counter, in a new
suit and a new hat. surrounded by atten-
dant damsels, nodding smilingly to his
customers. They crowd about him. A
rheumy-eyed old granny in a rusty black
dress stretches out a toilworn fist which
holds a shilling and reverently touches
his sleeve before she dives with experi-
enced ardor into the ruck of a forming
syndicate. The very embodiment of For-
tune is Mr. Whiddon, and well worth
the seeing, even if your, hat gets
crushed while doing it, and your left foot
aches where the unemployed navvy trod
on it during his mad charge to pros-
perity.
On the pavement outside a blind man
stands. He is a young man. He is very
still beside his board of lucky talismans.
If you care to take a mean advantage
and study him for a moment, as you
may study a blind man in a crowded
street without his knowing it, you will
size him up as a fine young fellow who
in different circumstances might have
done something with his life. He is very
neat and long-suffering under the ordeql
of standing hour after hour on a cold
pavement, with western blasts which blow
down Barrack-street squealing about his
ears. He seems the more patient and
immobile against the contrasting avari-
cious din about him. Nobody wants his
lucky charms to-day. It is cheaper and
luckier to touch the hem of Whiddon’s
garment and consult the attractive
almond-eyed oracles of Chung Ling Su.
Not a pleasant scene this. Not one
that exhibits Australians as the decent
and generous folk they at bottom are.
Not one to impress the stranger who
comes to the country with thoughts
of establishing a new business, a new
factory. And in three other States with
Government or Government-controlled
lotteries, similar exhibitions are to be
witnessed. It would be immeasurably
better for all except the harpies if the
Governments engaged in this ignoble
competition joined with the other Gov-
ernments (which may otherwise be forced
into it) and with the Commonwealth in
offering the useful alternatives to lottery
tickets available in European countries,
and facilities for saving up to buy them
—premium bonds.
WOMEN’S WAGES.
Of President Roosevelt’s national-recov-
ery programme I know nothing more
than the Australian newspapers I read
have told me, and the information they
furnish is scrappy. But one part of the
programme has impressed me mightily,
as it doubtless has thousands of other
Australian women who have to work for
their living. In the industrial codes of
which particulars have been given, there
is no great difference between the mini-
mum rates of pay prescribed for women
and men.
“S. M. Herald” quotes a code which
seems typical. The Association of Retail
Grocers offered to pay men 15 dollars
for a 54-hour working week and women
12 dollars for 48 hours. These rates,
according to the “Herald,” are equiva-
lent in Australian currency to £4 3s. for
men and £3 6s. for women, whereas
under Australian awards men get £4 6s.
and women £2 11s. for a 44-hour week.
In the same issue of the “Herald” it was
reported that the Commonwealth 'Arbi-
tration Court had fixed the basic wage
in the textile industry at £3 ss. 2d. per
44-hour week for men and 52 per cent,
of that —say, £1 13s. lOd. —for women.
Presumably the venerable gentlemen of
the Commonwealth Arbitration Court
have made this 52 per cent, a general
rule in industries where both men and
women are employed. In the State wage-
fixing shops, also controlled by elderly
gentlemen, the percentage is sometimes
a little higher, sometimes a little lower.
The N. S. Wales State tribunal fixed the
basic wage for the sexes at £3 10s. and
£1 18s. Queensland rates are (or were)
£3 14s. and£l 195.; Westralian, £3 10s. 6d.
and £1 18s. Id. in the metropolitan area,
£3 12s. 6d. and £1 19s. in the south-west
division, £3 18s. and £2 2s. 2d. on the
goldfields.
In a judgment dated December 4, 1931,
the South Australian shop declared the
basic wage at £3 3s. and £1 11s. 6d. I
should like to see the presiding genius
try to live on £1 11s. 6d. a week.
The needs of the woman worker are
as great as those of the man. In some
respects, they are greater. She has to
pay more attention to her dress and to
her appearance. Dental treatment costs
her more, since she cannot go to the
office or warehouse with gaps in her
mouth, although a man may. Because
of her sex she incurs periodical expenses
from which the lords of creation are free.
She is also more apt to need medical and
surgical attention, for which she is ex-
pected to pay, if she can, out of her
£1 18s. or £1 13s. lOd. or £1 lfs. 6d. a
week. In a multitude of cases her pit-
tance has to suffice for all her necessities.
In thousands of families she has become
the sole breadwinner.
“Why do girls go to business?” Mr.
Early-Victorian asks. In all but a few
instances, from sheer necessity. Because
their parents can’t keep them, and they
must work or starve —or eat the bread
of charity, or accept the appalling exist-
ence of the dependent spinster in a mean
home, or become kept women, or go on
the streets. The modern girl rejects all
these dreadful alternatives. She has “the
normal needs of a human being in a
civilised community” (where did I read
that?), and she has won the right to
satisfy them by honest labor. That right
will never be relinquished by women
who speak the English tongue, whatever
tyranny Continental dictators may prac-
tise at the expense of their women.
“But matrimony is woman’s natural
career,” Mr. Early-Victorian protests.
“Why don't girls marry instead of taking
men’s jobs?” Many do when they are
asked (ten years or more after they leave
school, and they have to live in the mean-
time) ; but thousands never are. In our
great centres of population there are not
enough husbands to go round. It seems
strange, but it is true ; and when doing
electoral work for one of the parties in
the Commonwealth campaign of 1929 I
received startling evidence of it.
In Wentworth (60,459 electors) there
were 7875 more women than men. In
Warringah (51,431 electors) there were
7459 more; in North Sydney (58,053
electors) 5753 more; in Martin (64,618
electors) 4685 more. In Melbourne sub-
urban electorates, the feminine prepon-
derance was even greater: 8187 more
women than men in Fawkner (46,663
electors), 8986 more in Kooyong (67,182)
and 7470 more in Henty (77,700). It was
much the same in other States. In Booth-
by, South Australia (49,275 electors), the
women exceeded the men by 5815; in
Perth, Westralia (43,532), by 2360; in
Denison, Tasmania (23,218), by 2622.
Men are still in the majority in the re-
mote parts of Australia, and presumably
most of them are single ; but it is hard
to see how the unclaimed treasures of
Kooyong, Wentworth, Boothby, Denison
and the rest are to meet them, “view
mat.,” unless the Government rounds up
unemployed spinsters periodically and
drives them to marriage markets.
In the world of business and industry
women have proved their worth. Many
forms of office work they do as well as
men, and better; and they are generally
more loyal to the job. As for sobriety
and honesty, the advantage is decidedly
on their side. You never hear of a girl
clerk coming to work in such a condi-
tion that she has to go out every now
and then for a hair of the dog that bit
her overnight, or taking the contents
of the cashbox to the races. Yet
under our basic-wage system women are
sweated in cold blood. Whether single
girls supporting themselves and helping
to support their mothers, or widows
maintaining children, they are fobbed off
with half the wages awarded to bachelors
doing the same class of work because
it is assumed (wrongly in many cases)
that the latter will marry and bring up
families. The U.S.A. obviously has more
enlightened ideas ; so good luck to the
Roosevelt programme, I say!
BUSINESS WOMAN.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
Fifty Per Cent. Off.
Very few people will agree with the
dictum of H. Gordon Bennett, president
of the N. S. Wales Chamber of Manu-
facturers, who told a meeting in Sydney
that “the high cost of living in Australia
is due in no small measure to the gener-
ous treatment meted out to producers by
Governments, and the burdens placed on
city interests to pay for that generosity.”
This is a species of sectional propaganda
which can benefit nobody.
Utterances like Mr. Bennett’s make
it less possible to get the balanced
national programme, so needful, under
which every part of the community that
can pay will bear its fair share of im-
posts and take its fair share of profits,
while jointly supporting industries which
it is vital to support until they can carry
themselves. It is obvious, for instance,
that if northern industries such as sugar
cannot bear their full load, other indus-
tries in the south must help to shoulder
the burden, counting their particular con-
tribution as a form of insurance payment
against the inevitable consequences to
Australia of continued sparseness of
northern occupation.
Men on the land and manufacturers
are alike necessary to this country. Aus-
tralia has an interest bill overseas which
in the worst year of the depression called
for payment of £35,000,000 Australian
out of a total national income of
£319,000,000. That £319,000,000 was
divided fairly equally into three parts.
A little less than one-third covered pri-
mary products used for local consumption,
an almost equal proportion represented
primary products sold overseas to main-
tain the trade balance, and a trifle more
than one-third was the value of manu-
facturing production. The striking fact
is that the ratio is so constant with that
of better years. When in 1926-27
the national production - income was
£447,354,000, the manufacturers’ share of
the output was £153,634,000, which
was about its normal level.
Let us have no more talk like Mr.
Gordon Bennett’s, nor any incitement from
any other quarter to a war of sections.
Live and let live. “More than half the
tariff is revenue-producing,” says White,
the Minister of Customs. That is
where the tariff is oppressive. Its
revenue incidence is felt far more than
its protective incidence; and any person
in authority, be his name Gordon Ben-
nett or Joseph Aloysius Lyons, who re-
sists the reduction of excessive revenue
duties does a disservice to Protection.
Instead of rushing into a sectional war,
land men and manufacturers, country and
city, should unite to secure a 50 per cent,
reduction of these revenue duties, to-
gether with a 50 per cent, reduction of
the Commonwealth income tax and sales
tax, of the State income, land and un-
employed-relief taxes, and total abolition
of the Commonwealth land tax and
the N. S. Wales family-endowment tax —
the whole to be financed for two years
by issues of premium bonds. If Lyons
is incapable of placing himself at the
head of this movement, Bruce is not.
«
The Christina Fraser Again.
Dear Bulletin, —Seafaring men are
not satisfied with the Court’s finding in
the Christina Fraser case. Despite an
ex-captain’s declaration that he would
have gone round the Horn in her, the
fact remains that the vessel was lost in
a mere local disturbance. The cause of
the disaster was not ascertained, nor, it
seems, was the total deadweight on board
the vessel —it includes bunkers, water,
stores, etc. —arrived at.
A check of the deadweight is the only
trustworthy guide in a port like Bulli,
where the swell makes it difficult, per-
haps impossible, to read either draft or
Plimsoll mark. The Christina Fraser
loaded 727 tons of cargo; but what
bunkers? And what bunkers were on
board her when she arrived at Bulli?
The public has not been informed.
The ship was tested on her maiden
voyage in Newcastle, presumably by the
deadweight capacity supplied by the
builders. This is subject to alteration as
a vessel gets older. Experts have given
ten tons per annum increase in weight
of a vessel 500 feet in length, so that such
a vessel would carry 100 tons less cargo
after 10 years.
The recognised practice now is to dis-
charge colliers with grabs. Towards the
finish of the discharge men go down the
hold to trim the coal to the grabs, from
corners where the grab cannot reach.
But, to save time and labor costs, a little
coal is, in most cases, left in the hold so as
to rush the steamer back for more coal.
When the next load is being taken on
board that left in the bottom should be
subtracted from the vessel’s capacity.
The Christina Fraser was of the
raised-quarterdeck type. This deck en-
titles a vessel to deeper draft owing to the
extra space or buoyancy, but it brings
the fore well-deck closer to the water.
Owing to the large proportion of her re-
serve buoyancy being aft, such a vessel
overloaded is the most dangerous of all
types when steaming into a sea.
I appreciate The Bulletin’s stand in
this matter. It is of a piece with its atti-
tude to the first finding on the Tahiti-
Greycliffe collision, when it was the only
publication to point out the faults of the
decision. —Yours etc., Master Mariner.

Charity Begins....
Chaffey, the N. S. Wales Chief Secre-
tary, is none too early with his proposed
measure to enforce audit of charitable
funds and to put a legal check on the
activities of parasites who batten on the
public in the name of mercy.
Asia has its beggars, but they are
usually modest persons, content to sit
on the mosque steps or outside the town
gate earning a few piastres or cash with
the aid of an artificial sore or somebody
else’s infant. They are a nuisance to
nobody who avoids them, and their sys-
tem has none of the objectionable fea-
tures of the bloated charity organiser
who infests Australian cities, and who
makes benevolence find him a car, a
lucrative job, sometimes a luxurious suite
of offices.
The Asiatic variety of beggar rarely
invades the home' He has never been
known to employ females wiih lachry-
mose voices to telephone strange house-
holders after dinner and sob about the
“poor little babies” and the “starving
mothers,” and imply that the non-giver
who calls the bluff is a heartless brute.
No books of lottery tickets for sale arrive
at the homes of perfect strangers by post
from the steps of St. Sophia or the Bund.
And the Asiatic mendicant is honest
about the destination of his collections.
He is his own “charity,” there to be
appraised by the giver. Nobody can
accuse him, as an audit officer, quoted
by Chaffey, accused one of Sydney’s
gorgeous cash-extraction concerns:
The “home” is apparently run for the bene-
fit of and the collectors, and only inci-
dentally for the needy.
There are, of course, many charity
organisations which are conducted hon-
estly and managed well. The compulsory
audit has no terrors for them ; it will
really be a boon, since they have suffered
through the methods of their exploiting
competitors. It is to be hoped that there
will be no “beg-pardons” about Chaffey’s
bill. It is not a case for half-measures.
Rather should the Minister submit notori-
ous enterprises to a retrospective audit,
followed by exposure and compulsory
disgorgement where private gains are
shown to have been ill gotten.

Well Done, Strathfield!
Dr. Earle Page, when Treasurer of the
Commonwealth, lived in the Sydney
suburb of Strathfield. It is to his credit
that he established the Loan Council and
the national sinking fund ; but it is a
pity he did not go further and decide
that Australia should eschew borrowing
and live within its income. He could
have got a capital example, on a small
scale, of this policy and its results with-
out stirring out of Strathfield ; for it has
been the steadfast policy of the Strath-
field Municipal Council. In the unfor-
tunate matter of the Federal-aid roads
also he failed to imbibe the Strathfield
spirit.
Moved by the appeals of the Stevens
Government for municipal support for
its work-for-the-dole scheme, the Strath-
field Council agreed to take £5OO of the
money offered at 3 p.c. With this excep-
tion it has not borrowed since a number
of old loans were converted in 1911. The
outstanding debt is now only £2590 at
4 per cent. At the end of 1931 it figured
at £2963 ; it is, in fact, being steadily
paid off, and unless Strathfield gets a
set of aldermen like those at Kuringai,
which owed £424,652 on Dec. 31, 1931,
and tried to borrow another £50,000 the
other day (the ratepayers flattened out
the proposal), Strathfield will be free of
debt in 1941, when the fixed debt matures.
There is a bit of an overdraft, but
interest on fixed loan and overdraft
amounted last year to £l4l. Fixed assets
exceed liabilities by £12,650 ss. 4d.; total
assets exceed total liabilities by £19,730
3s. 3d.
In common with other municipalities,
Strathfield has suffered from the tendency
of vote-catching Governments (Lang’s
was the latest) to enlarge the area of
non-rateable land. There is an unplea-
sant entry on the books to the efiect that
the unimproved value of non-rateable
land is about £103,000. If these proper-
ties were not exempt under the Local
Government Act the Strathfield rates
could be reduced considerably. They are
low all the same. Yet the municipality
is kept in apple-pie order. It is one of
the tidiest suburbs about Sydney. Total
area is 1885 acres. There are 118 acres
of parks, 60 miles of streets (51 miles
asphalted and nine miles metalled) and
7000 fig-trees, which make a fine show.
There is not a full mile of unmade road-
way in the place; the footpaths are
neatly designed, with asphalt sidewalks;
the streets are well lighted and are kept
clean.
Strathfield has a population of nearly
13,000, 3600 being ratepayers. Last year
they paid rates amounting to 4d, in the
£ of unimproved value (id. is for the
Main Roads Board), and out of a
revenue of £23,529, £3722 was spent on
parks and £BBO6 on works. Administra-
tive expenses amounted to £2334 ; during
seven years this item has never reached
£2500.
It is a record of which Mayor Short-
land, his brother-aldermen (among them
are ex-Mayors Frith, Davey and Cur-
now) and the staff may well be proud. If
the noisy breed of politicians, who voted
themselves lavish pay and privileges, had
served the people half as well as these
men have served Strathfield, the State
public debt, the annual balance-sheet and
the catalogue of taxes would not be so
frightful to contemplate.

The Bad Neighbor.
Germany has a malign gift for wishing
dangerous problems on the outside world.
The combination of German navalism
and militarism made war certain after
Agadir. And the Great War produced
another naval-armaments race. The
Americans have not built the strongest
battle fleet in the world with the object of
starting a war with the Japanese, much
less with the British. Their aim is to pro-
tect U.S.A. exporters of raw materials,
such as cotton-growers, from ruin in the
next war. They are afraid of future
blockade and submarine campaigns, and
so are other nations.
The spirit of vainglory in which the
Germans began and fought most of the
war —their bluster about frightfulness and
their threats of what they would do when
they won —led to the Versailles Treaty ;
and the Versailles Treaty, more than any
other single factor, led to the 1929 crisis.
Now Hitlerism is menacing the world
with a number of calamities, and chiefly
with a recrudescence of anti-Semitism.
Jews, according to report, are being ex-
pelled from Germany at the rate of over
a thousand a week. Already over 40,000
have gone into exile in France, England
and elsewhere. Germany, like every
other country, has been well served by
Jews. German Jews have shone in art,
letters, music and science ; 100,000 fought
and 12,000 fell for Germany in the world
war. The British are proud of having
had full-blooded Jews as Prime Minister
and Lord Chief Justice. Australians are
proud of having had full-blooded Jews
as leader of the A.I.F. and Governor-
General.
Yet the foreign Jew who has a low
standard of living, and is poor, if not
destitute and illiterate, can be a menace
when he arrives suddenly in the mass, as
New York and London have found. Hit-
ler is,not only unloading on adjacent
countries all his own country’s Jews,
assimilable and otherwise, but also un-
desirables and unemployables whom it
suits his book to call Jews. He has made
Germany the bad neighbor of the nations,
and if he doesn’t end by bringing down
on it the troubles that usually strike bad
neighbors it will be surprising.

Gold Passes.
Simon Hickey, M.L.C., writes:
The Bulletin overstates the value of the pass
to retiring Leg. Councillors. Trains will run
anyway, and the right figure at which to assess
the pass would be the amount these men would
spend on rail travel if they hadn’t the pendant
for their watch-chain. This would be more
like £lO p.a. than £l5O. The latter might be
the value in the case of a commercial traveller.
The same principle is involved in the smaller
estimate admittedly, but it is reduced to mean
proportions. It is skinflint meanness when
applied to the many who will retire voluntarily,
through their advanced age, after serving the
State gratuitously for 30 years and more.
Whether the retirement is voluntary or involun-
tary, these men were appointed for life, with
the solitary reward of the pass for their life’s
work.
Were the people consulted re passes for ex-
Councillors they might say No. They might
also say No in respect to the new Councillors
had they the chance. It is their way with poli-
ticians —when they get the chance. Politicians
know this and are largely cynical. There was
much, ado about granting octogenarian Henry
Parkes forty shillings a week forty years ago.
He did not long trespass on the public bounty.
Still we make regular pilgrimages to his buriai
place—that’s something!
Of late years the venue of warfare was often
transferred from the Assembly to the Council.
Doing the work meant expense to many Leg.
Councillors in having to live away from home.
To all it meant a loss of time. They
would be men of little enterprise if they could
not have otherwise used this time to their own
advantage. Instead, the advantage went to
the State. There is a difference between iust
losing your seat and losing it and being kicked
as well, and a solatium equal to a tenner or
so a year should not unduly wither the tendrils
of grateful memory.
The gold pass franks the holder over
the Government railways and tramways
of N. S. Wales and the Government rail-
ways of Victoria, Queensland, South
Aus., Westralia, Tasmania, the Common-
wealth and Maoriland. If it were offered
for sale to taxpayers at £lO p.a. there
would be grave danger of loss of life in
the rush to buy. Even a Sydney politi-
cian, dragged from his gold pass like a
vulture from its prey, would need to
spend more than 3s. lOd. a week travelling
from his home to his business (if any), to
shops and offices, sports grounds,
theatres, the houses of friends and holi-
day resorts.
Henry Parkes was in the N. S. Wales
Parliament for just on 50 years. He was
five times Premier, and he served two
other Premiers as Minister. There is
no analogy between his case and that of
the present-day Leg. Councillor who was
nominated with instructions to vote the
Chamber out of existence at the first
opportunity. Most of the Leg. Councillors
accepted their appointments on this ex-
press understanding. If Mr. Lang had
had his way they would have acted upon
it. Does Mr. Hickey say they should
have received life passes over the rail-
ways and tramways as a reward?
In the last days of the last disgraceful
Parliament most of these abolitionists
voted for the > Tax on Mortgages Bill,
which, among other things, would have
enabled the Lang Government to seize
10 per cent, of the money the life-insur-
ance concerns had out on mortgage-
part of the provision made by thrifty
people for their old age, and for widows
and the fatherless —while it exempted
Mr. Lang’s own 5 per cent, mortgage on
the “Labor Daily.” The Bulletin repeats
that it will be infamous if they are
allowed to retain the privilege of free
travelling in the N. S. Wales Government
trams and trains, and in the Government
trams and trains of the other parts of
Australia, largely at the expense of
people who, if the unspeakable measure
they passed had become effective, would
have been subjected to legalised robbery
in its worst form.
♦-
Hard-up Trade Unions.
The report of the N. S. Wales Registrar
of Trade-unions for 1932, just issued,
shows how hard the depression and ex-
tremism have hit industrial organisation.
Memberships which in 1927 reached their
peak at 356,333 dropped steadily after that
year of “Red Rules” activity, in which
Garden formed the Inner Group and
Lang became a dictator, to 279,828 at
Dec. 31, 1931, when Langism was in
full bloom.
The decline was virtually wholly
among male unionists. There were more
female unionists in 1931 than in 1927,
but male numbers had fallen off by one-
sixth. For three years after the exodus
began, however, executives managed to
increase the load on the workers’ backs
by a good deal. While 356,000 members
paid £505,000 in 1927, 340,000 paid
£637,000 in 1929. Then began the deluge.
In 1931, only £343,556 could be squeezed
out of ticket-holders, which is less than
they paid in any year since 1921; yet
benefits were the lowest paid for six
years—they came down to £105,000 dur-
ing the “Labor Daily” mortgagee’s
period, as against £177,000 paid in 1926.
In the last two years reviewed, there
were accumulated deficits of £70,083, and
funds were depleted to the extent of
£79,828. During the last half of *3l the
were depleted a further £41,000.
The richest union in the State is the
Northern Colliery Employees. The big-
gest is the A.R.U., which has 14,239
members —the total unionists employed
by the combined Railways and Tram-
ways numbered 36,000-odd at the begin-
ning of last year, 13 per cent, of
all unionists. The union subdivisions
throw a curious sidelight on civilisation.
Nearly 19 per cent, of all workers are
engaged in transport, and 17.8 per cent,
in mining and the engineering trades,
while it takes only 17.3 per cent, to pro-
vide man’s two most staple needs, food
and clothing, with beer and narcotics
thrown in.
The unions themselves furnish employ-
ment for heaps of officials. They cost
£289,458 to run in 1931. In a really good
year the amount has run up to £570,000.

"AND IT'S PRINTED WITH WIMBLE'S INKS"
"It beats me, Mrs. Higgins, how you manage to keep the fleas off your dog.

“Jungor”: At the Farmers and Settlers'
conference in Sydney, a motion that
Government should be fined for having
Crown lands infested with rabbits was
laughed out. Yet some half-baked re-
formers have been prepared to go even
further. Years ago a Westralian Labor
candidate, addressing the electors, de-
clared that he would never be satisfied
till all land was taxed. “Including Crown
lands?” interjected someone with gentle
guile. The orator rose to the bait like
a hungry trout. “Yes, including Crown
lands,” he asserted manfully. Although
he got in—and even subsequently became
an M.H.R. —he never quite lived down
that amazing declaration.

“L. 1.8.”: The military mind may be
slow, but it “gets there just the same,”
as the old music-hall song had it. The
other day it was formally announced
that a new stretcher for cavalry had been
evolved, consisting of a strip of canvas
and two bamboo poles, so light that it
could be carried by a mounted man.
When the Light Horse entered Sinai in
April, 1916, they found huge quantities
of bamboo poles used by the Bedouin
to spread their nets for trapping migrat-
ing quails. The regimental stretcher-
bearers promptly cut those ponderous
wooden poles off the service stretchers
and substituted the bamboos, which
served their turn from Romani to Dam-
ascus. These were carried by the rider
slung in any fashion that pleased his
fancy best.
“X.S.”: Reasons for not serving on
juries, is it? At General Sessions in Mel-
bourne a man said he would not be able
to give a decision, as. he had not seen
the actual happening which was the sub-
ject of the inquiry. Pressed for an explana-
tion, he said he had once served in a case
where a verdict, given on talse evidence,
resulted in an innocent person s impris-
onment and the death through grief of
another person. ’Sonah excused him.
“Nakhoda”: One of the by-products
of the depression in Melbourne is a
periodical outburst of sentimentalism
over trees, animals and suchlike defence-
less things. The latest is an eruption of
“I suppose you are everything to your husband now?”
“Almost. But there’s a few names he hasn’t thought of yet.”
indignation against the Zoo. Sundry
well-meaning animalitarians have been
weeping in the press over the spectacle
of “lovely beasts” cooped up in cages
when they should be “roaming the jungle
and enjoying their natural liberty.” The
truth is that few animals “roam the
jungle” in careless freedom; most of them
slink about it in constant fear of their
lives. Moreover, their expectation of life
in a.zoo is very much longer than outside.
The be§t argument against Melbourne
Zoo, which is in chronic need of funds
because it has to teed its clientele better
than a family on the dole is fed by the
Government, is that its educational influ-
ence is thoroughly bad. The small boy
needs it less than ever to-day. An animal
talkie like “Chang” or “Bring ’Em Back
Alive” gives a more stimulating impres-
sion of wild nature than the sight of a
lot of seedy-looking, dyspeptic brutes in
solitary confinement behind bars in the
wrong climate and without any privacy.
“Sandig”: “Koplik” notwithstanding,
“Pawang” (B. 26/7/’33) is correct in his
suggestion that narrow hips mean difficult
childbearing. An explanation of the low
rate of maternal mortality in Holland
may lie in the fact that Dutch women,
like Dutch ships, are broad in the beam.
But violent outdoor exercise during the
’teens and twenties, especially in strenu-
ous masculine sports, for which women s
muscles and functions were never in-
tended, produces a male-like pelvis which
causes a lengthy, worrying confinement.
This is often followed within a few
months by chronic backache and general
ill-health.
“Shoot, Durn Yuh!”: Melbourne's
police force continues to be mechanised.
Its latest acquisition is a Daimler wire-
less patrol-car which can touch 100
m.p.h. when required. It forms one of
a fleet of five patrol-cars and six: motor-
cycle patrols which, linked up with coun-
try units, is capable of throwing a net
over pretty well the entire State The
scheme has had its vicissitudes. On one
occasion a car was tearing through the
outskirts of the city at 70 m.p.h. in pursuit
of a gang of thugs when it ran on to a
stretch of torn-up tramway track. It
bumped over the for a hundred
yards before coming to grief ; one map
was killed and the rest more or less seri-
ously injured. It turned out that two
departments had been concerned in the
road repairs, .and each thought the other
had informed Russell-street of the danger
to navigation. That sort of thing has
since been guarded against.
“Blackadder”: lam just as tired as “El
V.” (B. 16/8/’33) of reading in the obitu-

Victoria or the Speck that the most mem-
orable event in his life was when he was
stuck up by the Kellys or passed the
time of day with Gilbert. Westralia
seems to be almost the only State where
a veteran settler can die without reminis-
cences of the bushranging days being
evoked. This arises from lack of
material. The nearest approach to a
bushranger that the West ever knew was
"Moondyne Joe." and he appears to have
been little more than an agile horse-thie!
with some skill in prison-breaking. Still,
there have been attempts to weave Claude
Duval-ish stories about the head of even
this humble crook. For years a story
lingered that the officers of the law
hunted him vainly for months and nevei
would have captured him alive had he
not incautiously broken into a Swan-side
vineyard cellar and drunk too deeply of
its contents. And even that yarn has
been blown out. Moondyne, according
to a contemporary, was run to earth in
a cellar, but he hadn’t had time to punish
the vintages before the Philistines were
upon him Actually he was hiding be-
tween casks.

ist.” A couple of years later “Smiler” was
desperately anxious to get to South Africa
as a war correspondent. It was a case
of sending round the hat to find the
steamer fare, and the first man to come
along with a generous donation was
Morgans. Hales got away and made
such good use of his opportunities that
a London daily presently engaged him,
and he crashed his way into Fleet-street
to become a regular war correspondent
and to write best-sellers as well.

“Runa”: After a late and convivial
evening at a Sydney hotel the visitor from
the country emerged in search of a taxi.
He had a confused recollection of some-
one demanding his wallet and returning
him a mere ten-shilling note, but in his
uplifted state he didn’t care, especially
as a moment later a large and luxurious
limousine drew up and a genial voice
invited him to enter. His next recollec-
tion was of a Darlinghurst flat, with the
usual beautiful lady as hostess and two
more genial gentlemen and lots of cham -
pagne. When he awoke he was sitting
in the dim dawn on a bench in Rush-
cutter Bay, minus the ten-shilling note
and a few odds and ends. After a period
of bitter self-reproach he reasoned that
there was nothing for it but to walk into
the city, place his cruel predicament be-
fore the friend who had lured him to the
hotel the night before, and borrow his
fare back to the farm. When the friend
produced his wallet with five £lO notes
still intact he decided that there was
nothing like an understanding pal.

“Sixenate”: “Phyl” (B. 16/8/’33) is
quite right in his explanation of how the
maintenance law stands to-day ; never-
theless there is an ancient “wife-starver”
who spent 29 solid years in gaol in
N.S.W. because of the money he owed
the lady. He was a recalcitrant who defi-
nitely said that he would not pay a
penny. Directly he came out of prison,
after incurring the penalty of one
non-payment, his wife pursued him for
the fresh accumulation, and back he went
again. After their child had grown up
the mother still held her claim for her-
self, and persistently enforced the pen-
alty. To-day, with the suspension of all
maintenance dues while the defaulter is
in prison, anything like that could not
happen.
TWO FINGERS OF FIZZ.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Jardine relates how, in the blazing weather of the
fourth Test, the English bowlers were given two
sij>s of champagne apiece with excellent results.”
It’s Whyte-Melvillc, I think, who attention has
drawn
To the fact that in war and the chill of the
dawn,
When a soldier most needs what the French,
call elan.
“A ration of brandy puts heart in a man."
But in cricket, when bowlers determinedly strain
To break stubborn batsmen's defences in vain,
A better specific’s a sip of champagne
Just a mouthful of Heidscck, the veriest nip,
Is a matchless renewer of devil and zip.
Hats off to Jardine! The discovery’s his
That a Test may be won by two fingers of fizz.
Sheer pluck is a winner of matches galore,
And dogged endurance of possibly more;
And flatly refusing to slacken or tire
Has pulled numbers of games that looked lost
from the fire.
But man is but mortal, when all’s said and done,
And when, over to over, the speed merchants
run
To pelt down their goods ’neath a blistering sun.
And the Hill is beginning to jecringly doubt
If their favorite idols will ever be out,
It’s time to remember what excellent biz
May be worked by a couple of fingers of fizz.
When the batsmen seem rock-like and sturdily
set
And trundlers are hampered by rivers of sweat;
When figures go steadily up on the board
Till it looks for a cert, there’ll be centuries
scored,
There’s nought to compare, for a staff and a
stay
(At the time when the quenchers arrive on a
tray),
With a spot of Veuve Clicquot or Perrier Jouet.
But keep it for bowlers —ev’n miniature nips
Are hardly the thing for the legs or the slips—
And their fast ones will gain an additional whiz
From the force of a couple of fingers of fizz.
Cricket’s ever a game that’s developing. Hence
There’ll be always hew modes of attack and
defence.
And the chap with the ball, though he counted
it hard,
Had to grin and endure it when resin was
barred.
But there’s nought in the rules that they play
under yet
Forbidding a player his whistle to wet
When a knotty dilemma has got to be met.
So here’s to Jardine, who’s admittedly done
Some real pioneering in more ways than one,
The first to discover the merit there is
On the field in a couple of fingers of fizz!
N.S.W.
IFORD.


“F.S.”: I am interested in Miss Girvan
Dundas, an English actress who landed
in Melbourne the qfher day. Miss Dun-
das complains that Australians stare at
her because she paints her finger-
nails the color of the dress she
happens to be wearing—she was in
black on the day she landed. I should
say that it is a tribute to the courtesy
of the Australian that he does stare at
Miss Dundas’s blackened finger-nails, be-
cause, if she doesn’t blacken her finger-
nails in order to attract attention, why
does she blacken them? The finger-
nail as God made it is beautiful both in
texture and color, but when covered with
artificial enamel it is definitely ugly,
though no doubt fashionable. The only
occasion when it is natural for a human
'Heavens, George, what is the matter?”
"You’ve stuck a flypaper on my chest instead of a porous plaster.!"
being to have blackened finger-nails is
when he has died of cholera, just as the
only occasion when it is natural for a
woman to have the popular scarlet lips
is when she has a temperature of 105.
1 for one cannot help staring when I
see a woman* walking along Collins-
street apparently in the best of health
when her lips indicate high fever and
her finger-nails suggest that she ought
to be in her coffin.
“Pikirangi”: In the days when Maori-
land had provincial government, the
member for Dunstan arose to address the
Otago Provincial Council. . He had been
requested to speak by some of his con-
stituents who were visiting town and who
had impressed upon him that he had been
silent too long. As he caught the
Speaker’s eye, they settled themselves
interestedly, confident that he would give
the House something out of the common.
He did. “Ye’ll Mr. Speaker,”
thundered the village Hampden, pointing
to the fireplace, “the reek’s no' gaen oop
the lum.”
* * * *
“Adelaide”: A well-to-do S. Aus.
widow has gained a somewhat barren
Supreme Court judgment against a young
lawyer (left the State) and a sharebroker
(in gaol) for £lO,OOO which she handed
them to invest; “not negligence, but deli-
berate fraud on their part,” said Chief
Justice Murray. But the main interest
of the case was whether the lawyer’s
wife, his old and much-respected father
and another partner were liable to make
good the loss ; and the Court said No.
* * * *
“Nor’-West”: I once witnessed a police-
court case in Roebourne (W.A.), when
Sing Hoy was suing Ah Hip for payment
for a horse and cart, the receipt for
which, according to the defendant, had
been mislaid. Witnesses were numerous
on both sides, and some hard swearing
took place, plates being broken, candles
blown out and even the “Clistian” Bible
kissed. The R.M. was still doubtful when
Sing Hoy challenged his alleged debtor
to the test of ordeal. Producing a, white
fowl from a bag, he demanded that the
other should chop its head off. The chal-
lenge was accepted ; joss sticks were lit,
a hatchet appeared, and the victim was
placed in position, the Bench looking in-
terestedly on. The defendant raised the
hatchet, for quite half a minute he held
it poisbd, and then his courage failed
him. Judgment was entered for Sing
Hoy.
* '■ * * *
“L’F”: A motor association recently
took count of 200 drivers and found 58
per cent, of the men and a slightly
smaller percentage of the women holding
the wheel incorrectly ; that is, gripping it
by the upper half. This position does not
give maximum control in an emergency.
Following up this line of investi-
gation, I find that the bulk of pictorial
advertisements for cars, both on hoard-
ings and in the press, show the debonair
drivers adopting the same mode.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: AS. Aus. testator has intro-
duced the lottery idea into will-making.
After dividing his £ll,OOO estate among
relatives, his will directs that, for a dia-
mond ring which won’t divide, “the eldest
surviving son of each of my four daugh-
ters shall draw lots.” and the result “shall
be binding and final in all respects.”
“X.S.”: The testamentary activities of
two humble carters of wood, Bendigo
men, occupied the Vic. Banco Court re-
cently. John and James Grafton made
mutual wills, leaving their possessions, to
each other. After the death of James,
John made a fresh will leaving his and
his brother’s property mainly to charity,
but granting to a neighbor and a solicitor
a large commis-
sion. A relative in
Ireland challenged
the will, but ’Sonah
upheld it. The sav-
ings of a wood-
carter would not be
supposed to be
worth arguing
about, but in this
case they amount-
ed to no less than
£7700, nearly eight
times as much as
was left by the
late Leo Cussen,
C.J.
* * *
“Lao-dah”: The
confession of a
Sydney Chinaman
that he had been
an opium addict
for 20 years is not
extraordinary. The
notion of the neces-
sarily deadly insist-
ence of the drug is
a movie supersti-
tion. During a long
experience of
Chinese opium-
eaters in China
and elsewhere I
met no more help-
less victims of the
drug than there are
beer or whisky sots
in Australia. Many
rickshaw men take
a chandu snifter
regularly every
morning before
going to work, and
never need to in-
crease the dose as
far as I could see.
When opium-smok-
ing was prohibited by the reformist
Republicans the same coolies used to
line up at the drug stones for tiny doses
of cocaine or other sense-soothers. When
a coolie does allow the thing to master
him, however, the effect is awful. He
oecomes a living skeleton which you
can smell a mile away.

“Kendall”: Who is the genius that
evolved the questionnaire to be signed by
all who apply to the N.S.W. Government
for an issue of free clothing? It requires
a declaration that the man applicant
is not possessed of more than one pair
of trousers, boots or socks, or more than
a single shirt. The same scarcity must
apply to his children, and his wife must
not be the possessor of more than one
dress, singlet, pair of shoes and pair of
stockings. The questionnaire has not
even commonsense to recommend it, for
there can be no possibility of a check
as to the truth of the declaration.

“Thrills”: The lot of the writer of
detective-fiction grows ever harder and
harder. As a spot to stow the hero while
in the clutches of the gang the lonely
farmhouse has been considered fool-
proof. That’s off. Real life has burst
the theory. An Oklahoma oil-millionaire
named Urschel was kidnapped. He was
dumped in a room with shuttered win-
dows, but was allowed a chiming clock.
Just after 5 a.m. each day Urschel heard
an aeroplane. An hour later he heard an
aeroplane coming from the opposite
direction. One day the second ’plane
didn’t pass. Several days later Urschel,
his ransom paid, was released. All he
had to do to ascertain the location of
the shack where he was held captive was
to study the running records of air trans-
port cos. He found that on the day when
he didn’t hear the second ’plane a storm
had cut out a ’plane which crossed am
other on a Texas route at 5.30 a.m. A
route-map gave the rest of the evidence,
and inside 12 hours the lonely farmhouse
had been located and its inmates arrested.

“Hyram”: It was Pitt-street on a Wed-
nesday. Hour, 1.5 p.m. In the offing there
were 7431 well-dressed young gentlemen
assuring an equal number of anxious-
looking and conspicuously not well-
dressed coves that it was “Quite all right.
Time presses now, but write in and make
an appointment.” Less apparent there
were 300 elderly blokes not conspicu-
ously well-dressed who could look the
whole world in the eye and owed not
any man, pradding softly along on their
own feet to luncheon in resorts of the
utmost discreetness. A flying squadron
of Rolls-Royces and Packards distributed
well-known chevaliers de finance to places
more expensive but not so discreet. Fate,
brooding gloomily amid the cosmic clouds,
cast an eye on the panorama, remem-
bered the Appian Way, and grinned.
Forth from the Quay dashed a chariot
labelled “Ninepence a Bucket.” From
this chariot men tossed mandarins to the
multitude. The well-dressed young
gentlemen got most of the fruit. Their
“I’ve got my wings, sir.”
“An’ judging by your last flight you’ll soon get your harp.”
shabby clients and a few hungry folk
who were just there by a fortuitous con-
currence got the rest. Sydney’s Appian
Way was paved from north to south with
mandarin-peel. The discreet old jokers
dodged it, meditating on the craziness of
a world that makes food so dear that it
can’t be bought and so cheap that it has
to be thrown away. But what that man-
darin-peel did to the less thoughtful, with-
out the slightest regard as to whether they
stepped out of an Isotta-Fraschini or a
tram, or just slid on to it unthinking-
like, was too bad. “Get on the land”
acquired a newer, truer meaning for folk
who had hitherto regarded it as a joke,
and several gentlemen who know very
well they ought to be assassinated be-
lieved for a moment that they had been.
* * * *
“Bohea”: The Australian, who has
long esteemed himself as a champion
tea-drinker, has received a nasty knock-
back from a leading taster. “Australians
do not appreciate good tea ; they drink
rubbish,” the expert says, and he goes
on to place the Irish first as connois-
seurs and the English second. In
England blenders get water from dif-
ferent counties so as to compose the
blend which gives the flavor most appre-
ciated in each. The poor old Australian
gum-tree, which has been blamed for
affecting the flavor of Australian tobacco,
has apparently been butting into the tea
business also. The expert instances a
grove of bluegums in Ceylon the tainted
breeze from which ruined an entire
season’s crop of tea.
**■ * *
“O’h Aonian”: Canberra florins (B.
26/7/’33) have always been collectors’
pieces in M.L. and how little they have
been circulated can be judged from the
latest addition to my own collection.
The wife, without noticing it, tendered
one at a local bootshop which does
quite a big turnover. The girl saw the
reverse of the coin, looked doubtful,
went away to consult a higher authority,
and came back with a shake of the head.
The cashier had vetoed it.
* * * *
“Junior Turf Club”: If there are per-
sons still existing with memories of com-
ing home with the milk in pre-war Brus-
sels, they can hardly fail to be moved
by the news that a campaign against
smuggling by the French has resulted in
the shooting of as many as 60 Belgian
shepherd dogs in a night, the intelligent
beasts being used for running the contra-
band over the border. The big, mastiff-
like tykes were to be met with in those
days on every Belgian road and street
pulling the little carts used by the milk
vendors and farm-produce dealers gener-
ally.
ALL OUT OF STEP BUT OUR JOCK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Professor Oliphant, lecturer on Elizabethan litera-
ture at Melbourne TTni., vigorously attacked the
popular conception of Shakspeare as the incomput-
able. Shakspea re was not an observer of
human affairs; there were few subjects on which Ben
.ionson had not a wider and deeper knowledge, tul-
>ome praise was bestowed on Shakspeare even for
qualities in which he was lamentably lacking. ”
“Out-topping knowledge”? Voice supremely
great
For all our weaknesses and griefs and pains.’
Singer whose magic none may emulate,
With “blazing, radiant insight” in his strains?
Such eulogies, in deathless letters graven,
May seem unshakable as time and tide
Along the far-off banks of Thames or Avon.
We stoop to no such adulation craven
Upon the Yarra’s side.
We won’t be hustled, like a llock of sheep,
Into the pads and ruts that custom shapes;
We revel in a scorn, pronounced and deep,
For servile copy-cats and sedulous apes.
In paths of art we suffer no directions
From anybody laying down the law;
And haven’t we the right to voice objections
To various Shakspearean imperfections,
The same as Bernard Shaw?
Incomparable, and without a peer?
Omniscient? Who ever heard such stuff!
Your trouble is you swallow all you hear
Provided that you hear it oft enough.
Why, rare Ben Jonson had his measure taken
In general knowledge upon any track,
Wherever beards were wagged and possets
shaken
(That is, assuming Shakspeare wasn’t Bacon),
From seamanship to sack.
That age-old chorus hailing him divine,
It makes one sick and tired. His feet were
clay,
The same material as yours and mine;
One sees rt surer, clearer, far away.
Let lesser critics without stint or ration
On Shakspeare in superlatives descant.
I view their herdlike antics with compassion—
They only do it to be in the fashion—
D’you hear, me ? Oliphant.

Overseas shipping companies have set
an example to Governments by reducing
freight-rates on Australian produce.
Beef and mutton are to cost 1\ per cent,
less to ship; pork and veal, 20 per cent,
less ; fruit, from 2d. to 3d. per case less ;
and the wool rate has come down one-
sixteenth of a penny per pound. The
shipping cos. are still budgeting for
deficits, but they realise that if their
volume of business is to increase costs
must be cut.
Commonwealth Ministers have been
seeing the banks about reduction of over-
draft rates, and have been told that any
benefit received from reduction of taxes
will be passed on to their customers. Last
year five trading banks paid £1,060,388
in taxation —inclusive of the overseas
taxes of three of them. Their net profits
totalled £1,367,158.
Following a South Aus. precedent,
Queensland Parliament is to provide
relief for deserving borrowers who have
got into the hands of sharks, by enabling
a legal review of moneylending con-
tracts. The only question is whether the
measure will go far enough to protect
the simple borrower from himself.
Melbourne is to have a wild zoo in
the hills. It is to be for Australian fauna,
and there should be no difficulty in stock-
ing it, with all the white elephants and
wild cats about. Among the former
will be some of the beautification schemes
for the centenary.
Sydney’s Lud Mayor proposes to let
a Boy Scout take his place in the rabbit-
skins for a day. The stunt can serve no
purpose except bewildering and mentally
inflating the urchin and interfering with
the work of the council’s officers. No
small boy can be Lud Mayor for a day
without being elected. He can’t perform
any real mayoral duty, and if he doesn’t
where is the sense in the thing?
In a recent issue of one of Moscow’s
propaganda newspapers the moujik was
earnestly invited to subscribe to a new
loan for the second Five-year Plan.
Patriots who had bought 3000 roubles’
worth of bonds and more were appre-
ciatively mentioned by name. As these
loans go on indefinitely, and interest is
at 10 per cent., here is proof positive of
the growth of a new rentier class, despite
denials of Australian Reds.
Whatever may be thought of the de-
sign for the new 10s. Commonwealth
note, there can be no two opinions about
the quality of the paper. It is so flimsy
that the slightest tug will tear a note in
two. Already the banks have been get-
ting back cartloads of severed notes, and
it seems likely that the whole issue will
have to be called in.
Butler, the Premier with a large majo-
rity who represents a minority of the
electors, has had the gall to bring in the
threatened bill extending the life of the
present S.A. Assembly to five years.
Lacey, the A.L.P. chief, who is called
Leader of the Opposition, though at least
one other Labor faction objects, proposed
that the measure be put to a vote of
the people. This zeal for the referendum
is belated; still the people will demand
to be consulted if it is seriously proposed
to deprive them of their right to deal
with these Assemblymen at the end of
three years. But a lot of people behind
Butler are not serious.
A Westralian Labor politician named
George Lambert has come out with a
declaration that if the effete East does
not “acknowledge Westralian difficul-
ties” he will be for “seizing the customs
at Fremantle,” even if he has to “march
behind the Nationalist member for Ned-
lands, Mr. Keenan.” Mr. Lambert is
elderly, and so is Mr. Keenan ; so also
is Mr. Craven-Griffiths, who is in favor
of “taking the best possible means of
giving effect to the decision of the people”
on the separation issue, “without any
further delay.” If it really comes to a
fight Diggers will be charmed to see belli-
cose old gentlemen in it, instead of egg-
ing on young fellows to do it all.
George- Lambert was Collier’s secre-
tary in Collier’s last period as leader of
the Opposition. It would do George no
harm to recall what happened in the end
to his Confederate exemplar, Beauregard.
The way of the secessionist who seizes
customs houses and the like is full of
bunkers.
Creswell O’Reilly, the Commonwealth
film censor, has himself been censored
by the ratepayers of Kuringai, of which
he is Mayor. He and his brother-alder-
men coolly proposed to add £50,000 to
the municipal debt, which in the last
annual report of Waites, the Government
Statistician, was given at £424,652; of
the Sydney suburbs only Willoughby
(£512,653), Waverley (£468,040) and
ELECTION CANVASSER: “Is your wife a Feminist?”
THE W ORM: “S-sh; have a screw at me.”
Randwick (£446,856) owed more. Pro-
testing ratepayers demanded a poll, and
the loan was rejected by a great majo-
rity. A most just and wise exercise of
a censorship.
N. S. Wales Parliament is open for
business again. It is to struggle with
bills “to amend the company law” (pro-
mised ever since the war), “to provide for
the privileges of retiring members of the
Leg. Council” and “to prohibit disloyal
organisations” ; bills for reorganising the
Metropolitan Water Board, protecting
the public against dishonest lawyers,
“giving effect to the Government’s trans-
port policy” (whatever that may be), and
heaps more—so many that Cabinet will
be glad when the Christmas holidays
arrive. Lang, of course, will not make
its path easy. And if the rank and file
of the U.A.P. and the U.C.P. are not
mere dummies, “retiring members of the
Leg. Council” will not have their “privi-
leges” voted to them with three hearty
British cheers.
Queensland’s Parliament faced a stag-
gering list of proposed bills when it met
again. One, reckoned the most import-
ant, is to implement the Government’s
scheme for settlement in the North ; pro-
vision is made in it for “acquiring” free-
hold land in the coastal belt which has
lain “idle” (“idleness” is to be defined
later) and for cutting it up into lease-
holds. And there is to be a marketing
bill by means of which it is hoped
to revive the pooling system, de-
stroyed by a High Court judgment, to-
gether with bills for the control of
tobacco, butter, bacon, milk and other
commodities. And the City of Brisbane
Act is to be amended to restore adult
franchise and popular election of the
Mayor, and day baking is to be provided
for. And all these measures and many
others are to be shot through the legis-
lative machine in one session.
Details of the Forgan Smith measure
designed to take over unused fertile land
in Queensland and subdivide it for closer
settlement are being kept secret. There
is no precedent for such legislation in
Australia, but a Maoriland enactment,
41 years old, gave a board the right to
resume land compulsorily and to fix com-
pensation for its own action. This bill
was for a fixed period only. In Queens-
land no limit is proposed.
Looking as if he had stepped out of a
bandbox, Parkhill, the P.M.G., bobbed
up at Hobart the other day and went
along blithely to a C.T.A. dinner. There
verbal thunderbolts fell on him. “Your
sales tax is the most iniquitous impost
ever inflicted on a long-suffering people,”
said Mallison, the president. “Since we
federated,” shouted Johnson, a vice-pre-
sident, “Tasmania has lost 53,000 people,
and your Navigation Act costs it
£lOO,OOO a year.” Parkhill caught an
early boat back to Sydney.
Holland and Barry, M’s.L.A., who
pegged out as a gold-mining claim the
Parkville land proposed to be given to
Melbourne Uni. women students for a
hostel, have had to submit to no end
of banter at Vic. Parliament House. In
their hearing in the dining-room a vet-
eran revived the story of Crick’s denun-
ciation in N.S.W. Assembly of the under-
taker-member who had criticised a min-
ing bill. Crick said the only shaft the
undertaker-member had ever dug was a
grave, the only cradle he had handled
was a coffin, and the only gold he had
studied at close quarters was that in the
false teeth of the deceased he was about
to plant. The Holland-Barry claim skirts
a cemetery.
Recognising “a moral obligation” to the
300-odd British migrants who went broke
on overboomed Victorian land, “but not
a legal responsibility,” the Argyle Gov-
ernment is offering compensation, to cost
£300,000. Those who want to quit
are to get £2OO to £5OO in cash ; those
who wish to take a second chance are
to receive the equivalent in liabilities
written down. An arbitrator is to deter-
mine. whether the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment is liable for the whole or any
part of the £lOO,OOO cash estimated to be
required ; in any case, its ear is to be
bitten for the £lOO,OOO. Britain accepts
the scheme, but the migrants are dissatis-
fied, though not more so than the tax-
payers.
The zeal of the Melbourne policeman
was badly overdone in the case of a girl
who was trying to cross an intersection
against the red light. She argued the
point, and the cop put her in a taxi and
took her to Russell-street. There her
fingerprints were taken. This was in
accordance with a general order. At
Minister Macfarlan’s instance another
general order has gone forth that in
future the police are not to make such
fools of themselves.
If Hitler knew his history he would
leave Austria alone. Austria has been
the birthplace of carnage and the death-
bed of reputations and ambitions. The
French in the mid-eighteenth century
played with it and found themselves in-
volved in the wars of the Austrian Succes-
sion and the Seven Years’ War. Napoleon
beat it in many battles —and went to
Elba because he wrongly judged that the
Emperor, his father-in-law, would not
fight against him. Bismarck picked a
quarrel with Austria as a preliminary to
founding the German Empire. The re-
sultant moves wrecked first France and
then Germany, and nearly wrecked the
world within half a century. Vienna is
a fine place to leave alone.
Scullin had a rough time in Queens-
land, which does not think as Rich-
mond (Vic.) thinks about such mat-
ters as increasing the price of sugar.
And there have been lions like J. A. J.
Hunter in the path. Every time the hope
of Federal Labor shouted “We must have
our war debts cancelled,” these animals
growled out that in 1932 war-debt obli-
gations represented only £286,000,000 out
of a total Australian national debt of
£1,187,000,000; that of this a mere
£80,000,000 or so was owed to the British
Government, and that we have paid
neither interest nor redemption on the
amount for three years. Also that we
won’t have to pay another stiver if
Scullin can persuade Roosevelt (who, it
seems, has borrowed the Federal Labor
programme) to accept the terms of the
Balfour Note.
More pliant or less suspicious than
when the Trades Hall was ruling, Vic.
Uppish House is passing out Govern-
ment measures without a murmur. Thus
Jones is finding it easier to lead for the
Argyle Ministry than for the Hogans,
and he gets more help from Harold
Cohen, the Assistant Minister, than he
did from McNamara, Disney or Williams.
Fathered by Labor, the bill permitting
more latitude in street political meetings
would have had a poor chance ; handled

Thomas Glassey, doyen of ex-Senators,
was told 40 years ago that his heart beat
irregularly. He was refused an insurance
policy by a big company.. Now, at 89,
Glassey’s sight is almost gone, but he
still has a kick in him, and takes a keen
interest in public affairs.
Vale, T. J. McMahon, one of the most
travelled freelance journalists of the
Pacific. He was born at Mt. Abundance
(Q.), and, beginning work as a station
tutor on the Upper Burnett, gradually
drifted into journalism. He travelled all
the Eastern Pacific routes extensively
before he settled down as a member of
the Brisbane “Courier” staff in 1923.
Few men knew Queensland better.
The urbane J. W. Davidson, who has
been reappointed Commissioner for Rail-
ways in Queensland for a further three
years, looks like setting up a record for
permanence in the job. He is a Glas-
wegian who has risen through all grades
of the service from a junior clerkship,
secured 43 years ago. He was general
traffic manager for many years before
his promotion to the Commissionership
in 1919, when, after a tour of America,
he remodelled the managerial system.
His faculty for getting along with every-
body is his strong point.
There’s nothing doubtful about our
agricultural future while we breed lads
like young George Padman, of the Albury
Junior Farmers’ Club. He has won five
State championships in junior trials, and
at the last Albury Show secured the sash
for the best-reared calf' and the blue
ribbon for export lambs in the open
classes. Recently, he cropped 150 bushels
of maize off an acre in a year when
the best adult records in the State com-
petitions were 120 bushels in the north
and 140 bushels in the south. Though
still in his teens he is one of Riverina’s
experts in land fertilisation.
Only one of the original pioneers of
the Normanby (Q.) goldfield now sur-
vives, Mrs. William Sinclair, her hus-
band having died last week. He was a
descendant of Captain Sinclair, the dis-
coverer of Port Denison. The pair went
to Normanby over 40 years ago.
ERNEST FIELD, president of the N. S.
Wales Farmers and Settlers.
Alexander Samuel Adams, who has
retired from the M.L. Supreme Court
Bench at 72, is a native of Taieri, Otago.
For over a decade he has been dispens-
ing justice at Christchurch, in succession
to Edward Denniston, like Adams of
Scottish parentage. Adams came to
the Bench as one of the three most
notable advocates of Prohibition his
country has produced ; but he had, for so
staunch a Puritan, a wide tolerance of
human weaknesses. The legal frater-
nity liked him—he was strict on rules,
but not half as pernickety as Denniston
—and on his retirement they paid for a
portrait of Adams which is to deck the
cold granite wall of the Christchurch
Supreme Court.
Captain Lyn Maplestone, who runs the
Federal Government’s cinema branch,
has done more to put Australia on the
world’s screens than any other man. He
prepares all the industrial films now being
shown overseas,; some are exhibited at the
two njost exclusive theatres in the world—-
the Roxy, New York, and the Haymarket,
London. His masterpiece, just completed,
Capt. LYN MAPLESTONE, who makes
the Commonwealth’s official movie films.
is the prizefight between Cactoblastis
and the champion agricultural heavy-
weight, Prickly Pear. Cactoblastis won
by 8,000,000 acres. The star of another
of his opuses was a magnificent rooster
which was billed to crow over a record
lay of Australian eggs. Under the light of
the studio arcs the bird went to sleep.
Another rooster was introduced, and pro-
duction was held up by a 20-minute
scrap. Maplestone was head of the motor
transport division on the Western Front,
and was the last A.I.F. officer to leave
France.
Brig.-Gen. Jess, the new organiser of
Melbourne centenary revels, is respon-
sible for a tentative design for a sym-
bolic badge to commemorate the shivoo.
It consists of a naked rider (young Vic-
toria, grown to vigorous manhood)
mounted on a horse (the spirit and
energy of the past, with a sidelight on
Australia’s deification of the animal),
holding aloft a torch (denoting the thanks
of the people reviewing the past). Jess
is an amateur draughtsman whose hobby
is making a record of military costumery
through the ages.
One of the two or three pure-blooded
white men at Tristan da Cunha is Rev.
A. C. Partridge, who is Governor,
Premier, Judge, teacher, preacher, Arbi-
tration Court, policeman, doctor and
dentist. Over 160 (chiefly descendants of
British soldiers who married native
women long ago) live happily under his
kindly rule. Partridge is the fifth resi-
dent parson on the island. He is fre-
quently annoyed / by outside welfare
workers who send him Bibles; Tristan
contains more Bibles per acre than any
other country in the world.
The members of the Oxford University
Expedition which, under the auspices of
the R.G.S., is en route to the New Heb-
rides include J. R. Baker, T. H. Harri-
son and T. F. Bird, who are among the
world’s most experienced men in zoolo-
gical exploration. Baker, a first-class
honors man in Natural Science and a
Trial Eights oarsman, has been to the
Hebrides before —in 1922-23 and 1927,
when he surveyed the highest peak yet
topped there by man. Harrison organ-
ised a recent expedition to Borneo for
his university and is an authority on the
bird and animal life of Lapland and
South America, while Bird’s field has
been the Congo.
Two men working at Cambridge on
the structure of the atom are Maori-
lander Lord Rutherford, the greatest
living authority on modern physics, and
Dr. Harrie Massey. Massey is a former
student of the Melb. Uni. High School
who went to England four years ago
with a research scholarship in his pocket,
and has been revisiting his home town
before he continues his work at the Uni-
versity of Belfast.
Sergeant Bob Gibson, winner of the
Melbourne police revolver - shooting
championship, is a crack shot with pistol,
rifle and sporting-gun; an expert fisher-
man ; a swimmer, bowls-player, golfer; a
bushman, rough-rider and boomerang-
thrower, and a musician. Few marks-
men are expert with both rifle and
pistol, for each has a different tech-
nique, but Gibson has made a great suc-
cess of both. As a former mounted
trooper, Gibson is known in pretty well
every part of Victoria. These days he
is chief of the bicycle patrol at Prahran.
Sir John Ellerman, who died the other
day leaving a cool thirty millions, half
of which is an involuntary legacy to the
British Treasury, had a short entry in
“Who’s Who” for a man of his wealth —
one line for every three millions. He
seems to have done nothing except be
born, get married —perilously late —own
shipping lines, become a baronet and a
fellow Companion of Honor with S.
M. Bruce, and die. He wasn’t even a
J. and he doesn’t seem to have be-
longed to a club. His one grand ges-
ture was occasionally to take a liner with
a crew of a hundred or so and go off on
a solitary cruise.
Major Bolingbroke, described by lon
Idriess in “The Desert Column” as an
“officer of outstanding courage and a
popular stickler for the rights of his
men,” now divides his time between golf
and handling the cockies’ mail at Woom-
bye (Q.), where he is stationed as post-
master. At Brisbane on the occasion of the
Russian riots in 1919, he was responsible
more than any other man for averting
bloodshed. He has only one bellicose
passion in life these days (which is shared
by all Diggers who took part in the
Desert Campaign), and that is to slowly
strangle romantic poets who write such
things as the “Bedouin Love Song.” The
Major got his D.S.O. after Gaza.
J. H. Hall, who succeeds Charlie Earle
as editor of the Wellington (M.L.)
“Dominion,” has found the Inky Way
a plush carpet. Born in Southland, where
his dad was a farmer, he joined the
“Southland Times” in 1916 as a copy-
holder. He was then 18. Within a year
he was chief reporter, and Christchurch
“Sun” then acquired his services for the
Press Gallery at Wellington. After three
years of that he decided that he needed a
University education, and took a scant
three years off to get it, emerging with an
M.A., with honors in Economics, a
Diploma in Journalism, and various
prizes. He returned to the “Sun,” after
two years in control of a country paper,
as its editor. An intensely serious young
man.
Herbert Nicholls, who is resigning the
Lieutenant-Governorship of Tasmania, is
a son of the inkwell—his parent edited
the Hobart “Mercury” for 29 years. He
held office in one Speck Ministry 20
years ago as Attorney-General and Min-
ister for Education, was for a tirpe leader
of the Opposition, became a Judge in
1909 and graduated to the Chief Justice-
ship in 1914. In 1916 he was made a
K. and two years later the letters
K.C.M.G. were pinned to him. As Lieut.-
Gov., he will be succeeded by Elliott
Lewis, who, 10 years his senior at 75,
is also a leading light of the law, an ex-
Premier and ex-Attorney-General, ex-
Chancellor of the Tasmanian University,
and with Isaacs, G.-G., alone surviving
of those who framed the Commonwealth
Constitution of 1897-98. Two of his sons
are in practice at the Bar.
The Reverend Robert Dey, D.D., is
one more warning to the Fourth Estate
that total abstinence means long life.
His strict temperance principles and
serene outlook have enabled him to
weather the storms of 85 years, during
half of which he has held a pen in his
right hand as editor of the “Australian
Christian World.” He is still hale enough
to take his annual holiday m North
Queensland, from which he has just re-
turned. He cannot, however, beat the
unique record of a fellow-journalist, ex-
Wesleyan parson F. W. Ward, who,
now 86, edited four metropolitan Aus-
tralian newspapers —Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph” (twice), Melbourne “Argus,”
Brisbane “Courier” and Brisbane “Tele-
graph,” as well as fighting in the last
Maori War.
The determined face in this picture
is that of Captain W. C. Schrader, one
of the best-known cargo captains trading
from Australia to Asia. He belongs to
a line which has developed an extensive
trade in flour to China. His father was
one of the best-known legal identities in
Captain W. C. SCHRADER, well known
on Asian cargo routes.
Sydney, and he himself passed through
Sydney Grammar School. During the
war he served with the Royal Navy and
took out the first of the flat-bottomed
ships which did .service on the Tigris and
Euphrates.
A. E. Morgans, who died in Perth the
other day, had some queer friends. One
of them was Zelaya, a Central American
dictator in pre-war days—a ferocious-
looking greaser with a flowing mous-
tache. To him succeeded Hoover, a mild
mining engineer on the Bewick, Moreing
staff, who was to become President of
the U.S.A. Morgans was Hoover’s con-
fidant when the young Quaker sent a
cablegram from Perth to a certain Miss
Lou Henry, of California, inviting her
to become Mrs. H. C. Hoover. After
Hoover came Tommy Walker, a Lanca-
shire Freethinker, who ran a Perth Sun-
day newspaper which Morgans backed
until it acquired too many libel actions.
Then Lovekin, who had been a circus
ringmaster, persuaded Morgans to finance
his Perth “Daily News” until he made a
fortune in newsprint deals; then he
availed himself of a clause in the partner-
ship agreement to force Morgans to a
disadvantageous sale. Stirred to anger for
once in his life, the ex-Premier sought out
a Bulletin man, who had been associ-
ated with a Perth weekly, to offer him
backing for a newspaper which was to
knock the Lovekin organ into smither-
eens. It came to nothing.

More than two-thirds of that profit re-
presents returns from investments; which
indicates how susceptible are institutions
such as this to interest-reduction. For
many years income from outside the
business practically paid the dividend,
and underwriting surpluses were left
to swell investments and the returns there-
from. But recently underwriting has been
much less profitable, additions to re-
serves have shrunk, and thus the snow-
balling process which was responsible for
the addition of £1,200,000 to the present
capital out of reserves has been slowed
down very perceptibly.
Though gift issues promise to be much
wider apart, it is a very solid investment
otherwise. Reserves are within £338,069
of capital (£1,500,000). The co. is very
carefully handled, too, as this compari-
son of underwriting results shows:

•General. tSan Francisco disaster.
Last term a more cautious policy was
adopted, insurable values shrank, and
there was a drop of £41,821 in the net
premiums. The co. knew what it was
doing ; losses were £48,675 lighter, and
exes, were cut £15,944. Thus the under-
writing surplus improved to £53,104, as
against £30,306, £51,573 and £99,386 in
the three preceding years. Interest and
rents (£120,044) were £6411 lighter;
altogether net profit for the year was
£18,214 stronger at £174,975, the margin
over the usual 10 p.c. div. increasing to
£24,975. Earnings were equal to 11.6
p.c. on capital, as against 10.4 p.c. in
1932.
The solid nature of . the backing for
policy-holders and shareholders is seen
in this table:

In 1932 £20,748 was written off security
values out of reserves. There is only
£52,000 held over broad acres. Public
securities moved up only £9656 last
term; the biggest movement was in
shares in other cos. (up £27,646). Gov-
ernment stocks are mainly British, M.L.
and Australian, but the spread is nearly
world-wide. Net tangibles were equal to
264 p.c. of last year’s net premiums.
Business in hand in the trustee branch
aggregated £6,157,848 at balance-day.
The market prices the scrip at 525., the
return being 3.8 p.c. on a 10 p.c. div.

Helped by its farmers’ co-operative
affiliations, this co developed a large
turnover soon after it started off in 1917.
A year or two later, on a capital ot
£41,452, it swallowed the N.S.W. busi-
ness of John Bridge and Co., at a cost
of £210,847, of which £24,100 represented
goodwill. After that it wasn’t long be-
fore the Co-op. was the largest handler
of primary products in N. S. Wales.
But the phenomenal growth of the
business has been a bit of a headache
for the board at times ; finance was otten
a problem. For the 11 years to 1929
profits aggregated £439,235, of which
£183,896 was paid in divs., and £140,611
in bonuses to clients. Then came the
crash in prices, and the co.’s resources
were strained to assist suppliers ; but alter
fading out in 1930 divs. and bonuses
bobbed up again in 1931. Since then
5 p.c. has been paid to shareholders
they cannot look for more than 8 p.c.
under the co.’s constitution.
Oh all Sydney floors wool sales were
approximately 100,000 bales heavier dur-
ing the year to June 30 ; proceeds were
up £1,630,000. The F. and G. handled
a record quantity of wool and livestock
over the period:
Wool, Wheat,
Bales. Sheep. Cattle. Bushels.

1933.. 178.750 1,024,171 4,500,000
N.S.W. wheat yield was 77 million
bushels; the proportion handled by the
co. is shown in the table. Owing to
lower selling charges gross earnings
(£198,729) were £11,298 lighter, but be-
cause of a cut of £9372 in exes. (£169,365,
including £8250 set aside for taxes) the
drop in net profit (£29,364) was reduced
to £1925. On wool commissions 20 p.c.
was rebated ; on other lines, 10 p.c. After
handing shareholders a 5 p.c. div., £3060
was carried to general reserves (now
£64,355 in excess of goodwill), which also
benefited by £2798 from the Insurance
Department.
When the outlook was blackest the
co. borrowed heavily to lend:

The working-down of the debt since
and the reduction in amounts owing has
been a surprising performance. Even
so, there,was 16s. Bd. of outside money
in the business at balance day for every
£1 belonging to shareholders, including
insurance reserves. Fixed assets alone
are in excess of capital and the general
lay-by. More or less liquids exceeded
the debt by £76,762, an improvement of
£7BBO during the year.
Production of wool in N.S.W. during
the current season is estimated at 1\ to
10 p.c. less than last year. Wheat prices,
though very low during the co.’s past
term, were much brighter when the
accounts closed. Obviously the strength
or otherwise of the financial position, as
well as future profit-earning, will largely
depend upon world prices and the sol-
vency of farmers.
The insurance section of the business
showed improvement:

The Dimboola, the co.’s only passenger
vessel, was brought back on to the West-
ralian run during the year; in the
summer, holiday excursions were carried
out by the same vessel, which had been
laid up for some time. Shipping activity
showed a loss in 1931. For the year to
June 30 the co. reports greater passen-
ger and cargo bookings, and earnings
have benefited. The profit claimed was
£6932 better at £25,669 ; taking reserve
movements into account, the showing, as
written in the introductory table, was
£12,398 stronger. On this basis enough
was earned to show 13.2 p.c. on ord.
capital, after allowing for pref. require-
ments. But it includes an unspecified
depreciation allowance, and to that ex-
tent is not genuine profit. Reserves in
the table are labelled nominal for the
same reason. The all-round 6 p.c. div.
took all but £3709 of the profit as
claimed by the board.
Earnings are assisted by returns from the
co.’s large investments, mostly accumu-
lated when times were flush. The lot figure
at £344,441, and represent Consols
£120,688, fixed deposits £142,000, deben-
tures £40,573, and shares in other cos-
£4l,lBl. A net return of 3 p.c. from these
holdings would pay the pref. div. and 2\
p.c. on the ords. Prospects of last year’s
div. rate being maintained or improved
upon therefore depend on cargo and pas-
senger traffic.

Fixed assets show little upward move-

value of investments, which include the
Hobson’s Bay Dock, thrown off as a
separate concern in 1926. Though slack,
the pup showed a small profit last term.
The market, quick to capitalise the
co.’s improved earning power, prices the

Drought wiped out most of the crop
in the Bundaberg district, Millaquin’s
crushings being a mere 27,632 tons. The
refinery—it usually handles about 4 p.c.
of the total sugar refined in the Com-
monwealth —did not earn very much, and
owing to fixed charges at the mill and
cultivation outlay on plantations (which
returned very little during the year) a net
loss of £6627 showed up. That was after
striking off £17,946 for depreciation, as
against £21,649 in the previous term. But
finances are exceedingly comfortable, so
a 6 p.c. div. was paid. Altogether, re-
serves were tapped for £36,627 during
the year.
The co. took over the sugar interests
which fell into the Q. N. Bank’s hands
in the ’nineties. It is well equipped to
take advantage of any improvement in
seasons and prices. Good rains have
fallen, and during the current year the
co. hopes to crush 130,000 tons. Last
term the average price (£l9 6s. Id.) per
ton for raws was nearly 19s. 7d. higher,
but it was actually due to the failure
of this and other cos.’ crops in the Bun-
daberg district; the proportion of the
Commonwealth’s output used in the
more remunerative home market was
65.5 p.c., as against 51 p.c. in 1931.
It is the export surplus that brings the
price down, and if good crops are har-
vested throughout Queensland this year
the average price will be more susceptible
to world-price movements.
Now look at the finances:—•

The year’s loss and div. payments are
reflected in a drop of £29,337 in the
more or less liquid surplus (£310,050).
But it is still a very comfortable position,
as witnessed by the investments of sur-
plus funds outside the business. At
balance-day there was £191,543 in Con-
sols, £67,174 shares in other cos., and
£46,905 in the bank. Fixed assets showed
a drop of £17,288 during the year.
The fact that it paid 6 p.c. during a
year of loss has enhanced the reputation
of the shares, which now stand at 275. 9d.
on ’Change. Return at that price is 4.3
p.c. on a 6 p.c. div. basis, or 6.5 p.c. if
the distribution recovers' to 9 p.c. Net
tangible backing amounts to 295. sd. per
share, 12s. sd. of it in surplus liquids.

Though it has never been really a
money-spinner—not since the public be-
came interested, anyway —this corset-
manufacturer has been a remarkably
steady performer, earning satisfactory
profits in good times and bad. Helped
partly by tariff, exchange and the change
in women’s fashions a couple of years
ago, more trade came the co.’s way in
1931 and 1932. But taxes and exchange
on imported raw materials offset much
of these benefits, and the co. has had
difficulty in reducing its selling prices.
Last term, thanks to the research which
has made the co.’s product a scientific
garment —it is now competing success-
fully through a subsidiary co. on the
English market —turnover was only 3
p.c. less than in 1932, and gross profit
was better. But bad debts were heavier,
and service expenditure also took more ;
thus, after handing £1645 to the staff, net
profit (£14,675) was £975 lighter, but
enough to pay the pref. div. and show
8.2 p.c. on ord. capital, compared with
8.7, 10.9, 7.4 and 11.2 p.c. back to 1929.
The 8 p.c. to the ords. was repeated, but
only £323 was left for reserves (£37,789),
which showed an unexplained reduction
of £2300 during the year.
The Vic. subsidiary earned less owing
to heavier sales-promotion exes.: the
Maoriland pup made further progress —
it is now manufacturing for another well-
established firm —and maintained its div.
Berlei (U.K.), Ltd., again made a loss,
but the high-class product is selling
better, and profits are expected shortly.
Laddaloc (in liq.) will pay a final div. of
about 3s. this year.

It’s a hard life just now, this job of look-
ing after deceased estates. The shrink-
age in capital values has meant smaller
commissions, and the lifeless property
markets have deferred the winding-up of
many estates, and profit thereon cannot
be taken into account. There is also
additional worry attached to investments,
both as regards the co.’s own and clients’
funds.
Australia’s oldest trustee co. last year

But the growth of £6059 in gross earn-
ings suggests that a bigger proportion of
the assets was distributed to beneficiaries.
The benefit to net profit was cramped by
a growth of £4769 in exes. (£59,378, in-
cluding £lOOO set aside for taxation);
thus shareholders were shown £9882 (up

Assets that have not
DEPRECIATED
UT HERE is comfort in looking at my A.M.P. policies in
these days of depreciated assets,” writes a member
of the Society. “Alone of all my investments, my
two A.M.P. policies are worth their face value and a good deal
besides.”
How true that is! How fares to-day the widow whose hus-
band’s savings were put into land and buildings with no ready
sale, and with rents barely covering rates and taxes? Or in
companies paying no dividends and the shares quoted at a
discount ?
When, for the protection of his wife and family, a man
assures in the A.M.P. for £lOO, or £l,OOO, or £lO,OOO, the
amount stated in the policy is paid in full (with all bonuses
added ), whether he die the next day or in the fullness of time.
This promise to pay is backed by 90 millions of assets.
Send to-day for a copy of “Investing in Happiness.” It tells
how to use the A.M.P. to win comfort and security; better
still, let an A.M.P. representative explain how easy it is.

Tullamore Gold Development. N.L.
(N.S.W.), has had geologist G. C. Gibson
run the rule over its property. He says
that “as there is every reason to expect
some continuation of values beyond the
present limitations of development, exer-
cise of the present option should be com-
pleted.” The directors concur, and have
made arrangements with the vendor to
spread the cash payments over a period
of 18 months.
The board reports on development up
to 15/8/’33 as follows:
The main shaft has been sunk to 250 ft. cm
the lode; work in the south drive has been dis-
continued for the present at about 175 ft. from
the shaft, owing to values becoming poorer;
the north drive has advanced to about 180 ft.
from the shaft, where the lode appears more
promising, both as to size and value, than at
any place in the mine. The north shaft, 150 ft.
north of main shaft, and 23ft. in depth, has
proved that the lode does not continue in that
direction as anticipated, but is in a more east-
erly direction. The south shaft, 300 ft. south of
main shaft, and 52ft. in depth, reveals a lode
about sft. wide, from which a sample taken by
Mr. Gibson assayed Bjdwt.
The shares, paid to Is. 6d., stood at
7s. 6d. last week-end.

Adelaide-controlled Bega Mines, N.L.
(N.S.W.), continues to issue doleful re-
ports. During the week to August 13 the
north drive advanced 20ft. to 65ft. ; the
face is chiefly slates, with a few half-inch
veins of quartz, which dolly “a fair quan-
tity of iron pyrites, but do not show any
other values.” The new shaft has been
deepened to 19ft.; the reef is nine inches
wide, and the dish shows a little fine gold.
Some Sydney shareholders are wonder-
ing whether local control mightn’t have
better success.

For July New Guinea Goldfields
reports that on location No. 3 the west
drive on No. 3 level was advanced 35ft.

location (No. 3 level) the drift was ad-
vanced 65ft. in ore averaging 7.2dwt.
gold and 17oz. silver over width of 30in.
Production for the month was 27030 z. of
bullion, the mill output of fine gold being
10450 z.

In July Wiluna treated 38,510 tons for
bullion estimated to contain 10,128 fine
ounces, worth £62,794 sterling (gold at
£6 45.), equal to £78,022 Australian cur-
rency. Working surplus is estimated at
£40,612 (Aust.). Working costs, 19s. sd.
a ton, include 2s. 6d. a ton for extinguish-
ing development account. On the 450 ft.
level development continues to expose
low-grade ore ; values (gold at 855.) on
other levels were as follows: 860 ft., 345.

believed to be distinct from the No. 2

tially reduced the number of Lake View
shares on the Australian register. In
November last the total was 490,734, in
March 391,932 and in July 322,315.

F. G. Brinsden, in his address at the
meeting of the Aust. Institute of Mining
in Kalgoorlie the other day, said that
while some of the lodes on the Golden
Mile did not live in calc schist, others,
notably in the Croesus Proprietary, did.
He added that success in many of the
properties had resulted from lateral pros-
pecting, and by the further development
of lodes which had been abandoned
because of their grade. Extensive driving
in a well-mineralised lode channel was
justified, because, although very low
assays might persist over a long length, a
profitable gold carrier was often discov-
ered. The number of parallel lodes in
many of the mines accounted for this.

North Kalgurli shareholders have sanc-
tioned the issue of 250,000 new 2s. shares,
increasing the total issue to 1,000,000.
This additional scrip is being offered to
shareholders in Britain at ss. (sterling) a
share ; in Australia the price is 6s. 3d.
in local currency. New capital will be
used in erecting treatment plant and in
development. Shareholders have also
cheerfully agreed to a sixpenny div.,
less English income tax. Co.’s Kalgooriie
property is making good headway, and
before long will probably rank next to
Lake View as the most important on the
field. Its plans show total length o f
lode more than 2000 ft., of good width
and value. The property appears to have
the makings of a really fine mine. Pre-
sent ore reserves equal in profit nearly
three-quarters of a million sterling. Gold
deposits in the co.’s Croesus leases, which
for the next five years will continue to
be worked on a profit-sharing basis with
the South Kalgurli, are daily increasing
in importance. At one point (1200 ft.
level) ounce ore is being stripped over a
width of 12ft. A Bulletin man recently
on the spot sees important discoveries
pending in both the North Kalgurli and
Croesus Pty.
Three gold-mining ventures well spoken
of in the West are Norseman, Ora Banda
and Ml. Jackson. The first-named is the
biggest of the three, and its gold car-
riers are said to be the best at present
visible outside Kalgooriie. Returns and
further developments should soon give a
good idea of the show’s real capacity as
a producer, profit-earner and permanent
venture. Ora Banda has a high-grade
cross-reef, which for its size looks impres-
sive, but the locality where it is situated
has not yet won a gold medal for per-
manency at depth. The reefs at Mt. Jack-
son are small, and have not been suffi-
ciently opened up to hazard an opinion
as to values at depth. So far prospects
are attractive.

At the Sons of Gwalia meeting a share-
holder moved and the rest applauded a
resolution that the general managers,
B.M. and Co., be handed 2000 guineas
“as a mark of appreciation of their suc-
cessful negotiation of a loan of £70,000
from the Westralian State Government in
1927.” But nothing was said about
the efforts of the present Minister for
Mines, Munsie, who, by inducing Cabinet
to agree to the loan, practically raised the
mine from the dead. Recent reports in-
dicate that the appearance of No. 26 level
justifies the belief that developments at
greater depth will be satisfactory. The
property could be worked efficiently with
the present steep underlay shaft down to
perhaps the No. 30 level, but to mine and
raise ore from below that point a new
vertical shaft would be necessary. The
cost of this work would probably amount
to £200,000, but the co. is not unduly
concerned about it, as funds are plenti-
ful, and wealth in sight is considerable.

Exemptions are in the air for most of
the leases on the Great Northern area,
Gympie, while finances are being con-
solidated and plant secured. But preli-
minary arrangements are already under
way to start sinking on one of the leases.
In the meantime another part of Gympie,
the Inglewood area, is being closely in-
vestigated, and has been reserved for
the time being from mining tenures.
There is an evident desire to secure leases
about Inglewood in addition to the Great
Northern. An air of optimism prevails
at Gympie that has been absent since the
Scottish closed down.

The old Oaks (N.Q.) field, now known
as Kidston, is having a good run this
year, the 15 head of stamps being kept
in full swing on two shifts. The best
month was March, 614 tons producing
2230 z. gold, averaging 7dwt. The aver-
age recoveries for years back were 4dwt.

per ton for 211 tons, and as most of the
ore is from open cut the profit has been
considerable. This was one of the main
shows in an option turned down last
year by a big southern co. But that par-
ticular co. likes its propositions gilt-
edged.
The Australian Mining Trust is get-
ting busy testing its concessions on the
Etheridge (N.Q.), where two of its chief
strings appear to be the Queenslander
lode, already considerably worked, and
an enormous crop near Forsayth known
as the Big Reef. This is a spectacularly
wide outcrop, reputed to test for sdwt.
gold, but formerly considered too low
grade at standard gold price. A mill is
to be erected somewhere close to For-
sayth, and is badly needed.

“R.R.L.”: Mulhall and party have un-
covered a rich lode about a mile east
of Cracow township, on ground pre-
viously worked and thrown up as unpay-
able. A shaft has been sunk five feet,
and is four feet in width without either
wall being disclosed. Assays show 520/..
to the ton, a very rich tail of gold being
obtainable in the dish from prospects
taken over 100 feet.
“N.T.8.”: One dowser at least has
enough faith in his rod to back it with
his own money. E. E. Tyler has been
boring for oil at Bargo (N.S.W.); a con-
siderable amount of gas has been met
with, but at 2300 ft. funds have run out.
Comment of experts on the venture has
been somewhat caustic.

SHADOW SHOWS.
The director of “It’s Great to Be
Alive,” at the Regent, has employed
the tabloid device of offering some-
thing for all classes and mental ages.
Raoul Roulien, the hero, is a Hebraic
crooner with a Bowery accent. He
begins in the polygamous Chevalier
manner, with a crowd of cuties com-
peting for his favors. The audience
is resigning itself to another Society
comedy after the usual drunk and under-
clothes-in-the-bedroom scenes when the
film suddenly goes phantasmic. A plague
has wiped out the men, and a matriarchy
under Edna May Oliver is in charge.
The ladies try to create a synthetic man
(introducing a skit on “Frankenstein”)
and then learn that Raoul is alive on a
distant island. The rush to secure him
enables some naval and air film sequences
to be dragged in ; the island shots are
out of a jungle film, and skits on a gang-
ster film and the world conference fol-
low. Finally there is a sort of back-stager
with ballets and armies of pretty girls.
The equivalent of a Ginger Meggs page
is lacking ; on the other hand the whole
show is infantile.
Bob Greig and Herbert Mundin are
servants, their cultivated voices contrast-
ing oddly with the tortured nasalities of
Mr. Roulien. Gloria Stewart plays prin-
cipal odalisque as if she hated it.
“Hold Your Man” is interesting so long
as it remains sordid. Jean Harlow,
as a lady of joy, and Clark Gable, as a
thief whom she saves from the police,
look, talk and behave like congenital
gaolbirds for the first half of the pic-
ture. Then Gable kills one of her ad-
mirers with a movie punch, and, for some
reason which the writer couldn’t fathom,
she is arrested and lodged in a cross be-
tween a gaol and a girls’ boarding-school.
The sentimentalists of the establishment
go to infinite trouble to engineer a wed-
ding between Jean and Clark in the chapel
of the seminary, or whatever it is. Girls
rush about passages and garden paths
hoodwinking the mistresses, as in a col-
legiate ; and when Clark has been
smuggled in and stands up before the
kindly nigger parson (who has providen-
tially called to pray with his wayward
daughter) and utters a resonant “I will,”
and when Jean, her whole soul in her
adoring eyes, breathes the same sacred
words, hardened movie-fans break down
on all sides. Clark, who is arrested a
few seconds later, will presumably pay
for the ceremony with his life. But what
matter? The baby will be born in wed-
lock.

“Stamboul,” at the Haymarket, is in-
troduced by some atmospheric shots,
dreamily, mistily beautiful or just badly
developed, according to the height of the
observer’s brow. It has the makings of
an unusual film of love-intrigue, but there
are so many periods of paralysed anima-
tion that the beginning is practically for-
gotten half-way through and the end
doesn’t matter so long as it arrives at
something over 4 m.p.h.
A German financial magnate, intend-
ing to do the right thing by his mistress,

attache (Warwick Ward). This scheme
fails, so he gets one of his debtors to
compromise her. The attache thereupon
murders the German, and the blame is
fastened on to an assassin, who’was about
to be executed for a couple of other
murders, anyway. The widow and the
attache confess their love —and, part !

seems more than usually exhilarating. It
is a modern-dress-and-dialogue version
of the one about the cowboy stranger
who helps the heroine to regenerate her
weakling brother. The brother has com-
mitted a robbery and is suspected of hav-
ing murdered Nigel de Brulier. Nigel
portrays an unusual and interesting char-
acter —a patriarchal evangelist, riding,
crying and painting up fiery texts all over
the wilderness. At the gang-leader’s
Border pub, where the kidnapped heroine
is dragged, the heroes and villains gain
and lose the upper hand with such be-
wildering rapidity that certain connois-
seurs in the under-12 division became
audibly derisive at Saturday’s matinee.
However, all was forgiven when the
sheriff rode up to finish George’s gallant
work in the good old way.

In “King Kong,” at the State, Robert
Armstrong has fulfilled his long-standing
ambition to introduce passion to a film of
the “Bring ’Em Back Alive” type. Fay
Wray, a down-and-out N. York maiden
who has got into trouble for stealing
fruit, is his chosen medium. On board
a steamer bound for a mysterious island
she meets and learns to love Bruce Cabot,
ship’s officer and woman-hater.
The expedition reaches its destination
as the natives are preparing to offer a girl
as bride to the god Kong. This is an
annual affair and quite a holiday for all
except the girl. Kong is an ape, 50 feet
high, who lives in a jungle which is cut
off from the village by a wall. The natives
offer Fay to him instead of the other
young lady, and her friends set out in
pursuit. Kong carries Fay in one hand
and fights dinosaurs and pterodactyls
with the other, but while he has his back
turned Bruce rescues her. Justifiably en-
raged, Kong shows fight, but the white
man’s brain is too much for him ; he
is gas-bombed, captured, yanked to N.
York and then exhibited as the Eighth
Wonder of the World. His escape and
climb with Fay in his arms to the top of
a skyscraper is a marvellous bit of photo-
graphy-faking. The finale shows his dis-
lodgment by the U.S. Air Force and the
return of Fay, permanent wave intact,
to Bruce’s arms.
It’s advertised as “only suitable for
adults.” A pity. The little ones would
love it for its healthy violence, and it has
points as a moral lesson stressing man’s
inhumanity To dumb animals.
James Cagney, in “Hard to Handle,”
at the Capitol, is a crook who suc-
ceeds on “Get-Rich-Quick Walling-
ford” lines. The general impression to
be gathered from the panorama is that
the sort of financial dodger he represents
only requires a dollar gilding to be recog-
nised as a hero. The ladies are horrible,
and the attempt to represent one of them
as the possessor of the softer domestic
emotions brings the production into the
realms of irony.
“Supernatural” is an attempt to drama-
tise a cheap thriller on the lines of the
higher film technique. A woman con-
victed of strangling three of her lovers
goes to the chair cherishing notions of
vengeance against lover No. 4, a spurious
spiritualist who betrayed her to the police.
By the agency of a psychologist who
temporarily restores her to life, her spirit
is released to inhabit another female body
and with that body’s fingers to strangle
her betrayer. Some extra horrors, such
as the murder of the spiritualist’s land-
lady with a poisoned ring, are thrown
in for good weight. The maidens who
represent the two principal characters
weren’t equipped by nature with the
qualities that make great tragediennes.
The mechanical effects are remarkably
clever.
Sundry Shows
A Bulletin man met Melba at the
Bijou Theatre, Melbourne, the other
night for the first time. It was her
counterfeit presentment in Beverley
Nichols’s novel “Evensong,” adapted for
the stage by Edward Krioblock and the
novelist. But as The Bulletin man
didn’t know Melba he can push that
lady right out of his mind and consider
Nichols’s Irela—that is Melba’s name in
the play—on her artistic merits alone.
Does she live? Yes, up to a point. She
is impulsive, downright, expansive, also
cunning, bad-tempered, greedy, head-
strong, avid of power, afraid of her rivals,
jealous, mean, romantic, realistic, senti-
mental and not in the least profound. In
short, she is a quite probable sort of a
woman, even a woman who might have
been possessed of such a voice as Melba
owned, for a singer is only an executant,
and a great executant is not necessarily a
great artist, and even great artists some-
times have, feet of .clay.
No doubt Melba had feet of this mat-
erial, like the rest of us, but the interest-
ing thing about “Evensong” is that it
is in the feet that Nichols is exclusively,
and even maliciously, interested. In
short, whether “Evensong” is a partial
portrait of Melba or not, it is certainly
a portrait of Beverley Nichols, and a
full-length one. No man is a hero to his
valet, and Nichols was at one time a
sort of valet to the Dame. He seems
to have studied the lady’s extremities
thoroughly—in fact, from that point of
view Irela is very much alive. But for
the rest the play is a dud. It has no
artistic beginning or end. For the most
part it just drivels along. It has no de-
velopment, no crisis, and the one im-
portant motive, the diva’s clayey extremi-
ties, crops up over and over again with
quite undramatic intensity. When Nichols
is studying Melba’s' feet he is more or
less a realist, but otherwise he reveals
himself as a purveyor of theatrical Brum-
magem. The performance of the Un-
named Players was artlessly funny and
generally crude. Wyn Breheny, who took
the leading role, has a monotonous
parrot-like delivery, but when she broke
the crockery and threw things about she
was vigorous enough. George Walton
acted impressively and wrung the emo-
tion out of Kober, the manager, to the
last drop. The crowd of assorted Eng-
lish and Continental aristocrats bore the
“On Our Selection” brand.
In the Great Lover type of play
there is always a fake seduction
which never comes off. This is usually
the highlight of the play. In “Fair Ex-
change,” by Bruno Frank, at Melbourne
Palace, it is a snail-like affair owing to
Theo Shall’s passion for playing over-
elaborate variations on slender themes.
Mrs. Shall was artistically in place in
this scene as the hesitating wife. A veil
of mystery is thrown over the proceed-
ings by a masked burglar who lures Mrs.
Shall out of her bedroom by playing on
a flute and then steals her pearls. This
gives William Ralston the opportunity of
introducing himself as a private detec-
tive in some excellent but extraneous
character-work. The play has some of
the elements of popularity and wouldn’t
suffer by a good deal of speeding-up.
In Melbourne, where good news travels
with the breathless speed of a cable tram,
the Spivakovsky concerts at the Town
Hall were better attended at the end
thereof than at the beginning. This fact
no doubt moved the management to break
all precedent by giving a final recital in
Melbourne’s most musical suburb, Mal-
vern. If the virtuoso business continues
to decline we may yet see Paderewski
doing the smalls and discovering that
Mum, Dad and the kids are at least as
good judges of music as the city intel-
lectual.

Peter Dawson brought his tunefulness
to a hungry market at Melb. King’s on
Saturday night. A full house asked for
more, both from the vocalist and from
his fellow-conspirator, pianist Tapia-
Caballero, and went on asking until the
latter’s polished grin and the former’s
bow were in danger of wearing out. With
fine impartiality Dawson hangs Old
Masters and potboilers together on the
line in his musical Royal Academy, and
there were no complaints against the
selection committee on Saturday night.
Caballero gave a distinguished perform-
ance of Beethoven’s sonata, op. 31.
* * *
The Alliance Franfaise put on
Moliere’s “L’Avare” for a couple of
nights at Melb. Garrick, in French, and
with a mainly Gallic cast. No attempt
was made to memorise, each character
(in costume) simply reading his part and
acting as far as was possible to an actor
with a book in his hand. Vanderkelen
made a good Maitre Jacques, but Cleante
seemed a trifle more concerned with the
suavity of his diction than with his ama-
tory and financial complications. Last
year’s staging of “Le Bourgeois Gentil-
homme” was in grander style.

Sydney’s memories of singers Maggie
Teyte and Tudor Davies, it seems, will
have to be filtered ones. As a proper
test of a vocalist there is nothing that
can be substituted for recital in a large,
well-filled hall. Present critic heard Miss
Teyte and Mr. Davies on one night in
A.B.C.’s broadcasting cubicle, on the next
over the air. The studio experience should
have come second, for these singers have
engaging personalities, and judgment of
their art cannot be divorced from con-
siderations that are not purely musical.
However, it may be said that in both
tests, the newcomers passed with honors.
Both have pleasant voices; both are
accomplished musicians, and they use
their notes with rare judgment Their
performance of the principal arias in the
first act of “La Boheme,” an event of
the second night, was memorable, and
Mr. Davies’s deliverance of “Celeste
Aida” was a revelation. If Australian
entrepreneurs meditate another season of
stage opera they might bear in mind that
the~ art of intelligent singing seems to
flourish better in London than in Milan.

THE “S. M. HERALD” REVIEWS A
NEW FILM AT “RUO EMOH.”
“Bubsy” is the fifth picture made by
Mr. Fred Wobble, of Killara, since the pur-
chase of his new camera,
the “Homovie Fan.”
Other films in the same
genre, of varying artistic
merit, have been “Ickie
Girlie,” from the Hornsby
studio of Mr. Woppledon-
Broun, and the Snail’s Bay
half-reeler, “I Love ’Oo,”
which was produced
under the joint direction
of Mr. and Mrs. Glubb.
The star of “Bubsy” is
again the producer’s tal-
ented three-year-old Eric,
the support being in the
hands of Miss Mary Bran-
nigan (nursemaid) and
Wowser (Airedale). One
might have wished for a
more impressive cast as
regards size. It will be
recalled by members of
the Better and Better
Home-made Films Club,
who attended the premiere
of “Ickie Girlie” in a body
that, in the opus in ques-
tion, there were no less
than 27 featured players,
including the veteran mime
Mrs. Glubb, sen. (aged
87), Rev. Smither and his
Sidesmen, and the School
of Arts Cocktail Girls —a winsome if
not altogether refined bevy.
But to one’s muttons! The initial
sequence of “Bubsy”'—incorporating a
delicious pastiche of the “Ruo Emoh”
lawn, in which the shadows cast by the
props and washing next door are handled
with dexterous reticence and an exquisite
and sure sense of subjective values —re-
veals Master Eric striking the slumbering
Wowser on the head with a spade. All
is instant action, recalling, in some sense,
the spirited effects achieved by the
Russian Eisenstein in his epic silent
“Potemkin.” Wowser gyrates in agony ;
Miss Brannigan rushes forward, cashing
aside her knitting en route ; Eric, greatly
daring, poises his spade for another blow.
One gets here, in an acute degree, the
atmosphere of brooding suspense, of fate-
ful waiting, which is to be found in the
more thoughtful Czecho-Slovakian films,
and notably in those of Imshi-Imshi.
Would that such works were screened in
Australia, from time to time, in place of
the vulgarisms and ineptitudes of Holly-
wood!
Wowser, as has been said, is in immi-
nent peril of another blow ; his teeth are
bared in the manner«of
one whose patience is at
an end; the devoted
nursemaid is rushing to
the rescue of her reckless
charge—when the action
comes to a dramatically
sudden end. One under-
stands that at this stage
the operator fell over the
instrument in his excite-
ment.
The star acted with his
customary naturalism, and
Wowser provided a sin-
cere if somewhat over-
emotional study. By com-
parison, Miss Brannigan’s
interpretation was gauche,
stiff, amateurish. “Bubsy,”
a Fred Wobble produc-
tion, was screened for the
first time in the dining-
room at “Ruo Emoh” on
Sunday night, immediately
after the Vicar had been
got rid of.

With puzzled mien and corrugated
brow he pondered his problem. Was ever
man caught on the horns of such a mad-
dening dilemma? Yet he could not debate
the problem indefinitely. Even now his
chance of acquiring a fortune might be
slipping away. His decision must be

ABORIGINALITIES
“O. W. Waireki”: “Never go to out-
back Queensland unless yer understand
abo. superstitions,” remarked Fretful
Fred. “I was there once an’ lost a good
job in a butcher’s shop through a timid
old black buck. He comes in an’ asks
fer some beef. ‘A roast?’ I inquires per-
litely. He nods. ‘Here’s a beaut.,’ says
me. ‘lt’s boned.’ ‘B-b-boned?’ he
squeaked, an’, with a bound that butted
me boss clean over the block, he made
fer th’ door.”
* * * *
“Asinorum”: Who says donkeys have
no sense of humor? One of the features
of Auckland (M.L.) Prosperity Week
hilarities was a Donkey Derby in which
the competing mokes were labelled with
famous names and ridden by dinkum
jockeys. Peter Pan, Silver Scorn, Veil-
mond, Bronze Eagle, Pillow Fight and
Ammon Ra lined up for the start. Veil-
mo nd won, but —and this is where the
donkeys have the laugh—he was the only
one to leave the starting barrier. The
rest gave a fine imitation of Gandhi, non-
co-operating.
* * * *
“34K”: The A.W.U. organiser landed
at our station a couple of weeks ago,
and had a grand time enrolling men.
As the poet says, “Counting jackeroos
“Had he been an inch taller the burglar’s bullet would have passed through
his heart.”
“Serves me right, p’liceman, fer marryin’ such a little squib.”
and niggers, he knocked up double
figgers.” Included in the tally was old
Ted, who’s been pensioned off 10 years or
more. After a lot of talk—on the organ-
iser’s side—Teddy took a ticket, twenty
five bobs’ worth. Now Ted’s trying to
find out “when is this ’ere sweep what
the feller sold me a ticket in gointer to
be drawn?”

“Wang”: The bridegroom, responding
to the toast of the newly-weds, warmed
to his theme. “I first met Beryl, ’ere,” he
said, “at th’ picnic before last up at
Glasstree Gully. We wus playin’ one
of them ring games where y’ hold each
other’s hands. Beryl wus next t’ me,
an’ she got holt of one of my fingers,
an’ hung on tight,, I sed t’ meself, ‘that
girl’s got th’ real milker’s grip! ’ ”
* * * *
“Endiadere”: Some of these modern
“explorers” make one wonder whether the
tales of older travellers are all they are
cracked up to be in the matter of vera-
city. One gentleman who is leaving for
Papua to do some movie stuff has
announced dramatically in the Sydney
press that he will
enter the unknown
regions at Buna
Bay, “the home of
most warlike
tribes,” and though
he will not flaunt
firearms “will have
his service revolver
handy.” Buna Bay
is now a Govern-
ment station, and
they grow sugar
close by. Thirty
years ago writer
and one or two
others laid out a
road from Buna to
Kumusi crossing
for the benefit of
the Yodda gold-
field. Not an hour passed but we
were accosted by hands of savages,
but they were soliciting tobacco and not
thirsting for our blood. I doubt if the pre-
sence of the Government or the mission-
aries have since changed their natures
for the worse.
* * * *
“M.M.E.”: I made a short stay in
Wyndham (W.A.) last year, and found
that almost every household there retains
the services of one or two dusky maids
with their “boys,” as their husbands are
termed; but not one has a piccaninny.
Gins realise that their services would not
be required had they a family. I ques-
tioned a talkative lubra as to the matter
—I thought Marie Stopes might have
something to do with it—but her reply, in
a somewhat disdainful manner, was “You
bin see ’em plenty fellow piccaninny if
you go longa missions!”

“Searchlight”: A chap on the N.S.W.
South Coast thought he had struck a good
thing when he produced some black- and
red-grained maize which appeared to be
immune to weevil. He introduced it
to the Agricultural Department with
honest pride, but the savants there would
have none of it, and frankly sniffed at his
yarn that the seed from which the stuff
was grown was reared by Luther Bur-
bank, and had been forwarded by a
friend in America. Disappointed, the ex-
perimenter fed the stuff to the chooks,
who walked around it surveying it from
a distance. In the morning it was all
lying around where he had thrown it,
and the fowls were showing signs of
famine. When he offered some to the
parrot that bird used dreadful language.
Then the grain was tried on the family
as porridge meal, but the innovator had
to eat it all himself, as his wife and off-
spring objected to zebra-colored mush.
He now says the world is hopelessly
conservative.
* * * *
“Shellback”: The theory that the Japs
were once the world’s worst seamen
(B. 9/8/’33) should take a lot of proving.
Baelz, one of the leading investigators
of Japanese origins, has established that
the dominant strain in the Nipponese is
Malay. The Malay element came north-
east from the archipelago on the kuro-
shiwo current, and brought with them the
Malay-like fishing-boats the Japanese
use to-day. Records show that in the
fourteenth century China entered a for-
mal protest against Japanese piracy, and
piracy calls for good seamanship. In
the sixteenth century, when the Japanese
were overrunning the Korean Peninsula
“Two Alsatians are being used by the N.S.W. police.”
“Nit, here's one uv th' new Johns!”
“A dog ought to pass him one.”
and the Yangste coast, a huge armada
was destroyed by the Koreans in Fusan
Harbor, the victors employing the first
ironclads in history, their junks being
sheathed with iron from stem to stern,
The existence of the Japanese armada
argues a number of competent seamen
to work it. Further, the sea sense shown
by the Japanese since they took up the
mantle of “civilised” warfare at sea and
their competent and extending mercan-
tile marine inevitably indicate early mari-
time origins.
* * * *
“Sam”: “Waranbini” (B. 2/8/’33) says
very few people have seen a red snake,
I’m one that has. In 1906 I was driving
a mob of wethers across the soft downs
in what was then known as Malakoff
paddock on Katandra station, N.Q., when
a bright scarlet snake I judged him to
be a few inches short of six feet—
appeared on the ground at the tail of
the mob. He was a very angry snake,
evidently having been well trodden on.
He came straight at me, and as I hadn't
a stockwhip I beat a hasty retreat at a
gallop, turning after a few strides to
have another look at him; but he had
disappeared. I reckoned it must have
been a tiger snake that had just shed its
skin. I’ve never seen another, but I know
I did see this one. The nearest pub was
70 miles away. * *
“San”: A reference to Phil McCooey
reminds me of his habit of sending The
Bulletin flora and fauna to prove dis-
puted contentions he had made on this
page. The posies he sent were all right, but
the animals usually arrived in an advanced
state of decomposition. Later in his day
McCooey paid a visit to The Bulletin
office to search the files. Someone let
Phil have a half-yearly volume, bound in
choice leather especially for editor
Archibald. McCooey couldn’t stand being
indoors, so he took the precious volume
downstairs and sat on the pavement in
George-street with his back to the wall
and his legs sticking out for passers-by
to fall over. Archibald spotted the sacri-
got ins™e is
“is eloquence when he got insme is sun
remembered. ( ,
“The Walrus”: There is a move in
Queensland to help aboriginals at salt-
water settlements like the Palm Islands
to help themselves by undertaking the
culture of the edible oyster. N.Q. coastal
aboriginals are pearl-shell and beche-de-
mer divers of the best; numbers of
them, with a considerable fleet of their
own boats, are employed in fishing for
these commodities and for trochus, the
catch being marketed by the Aborigines
Protection Department at Thursday
Island. It is hoped by the advocates of
edible-oyster culture that it may afford
an interesting and profitable employment
for the many inland natives in thb settle-
ments who are not accustomed to diving
conditions. The department is not en-
thusiastic. It considers that ex-stockmen
used to rounding up scrub cattle would
not take kindly to the job of encouraging
the sedentary oyster in his native mud.
Further, it says that whatever profit there
may be for the Dago dispensing oysters
at Is. 6d. the small plate, the farming
and gathering of them is a starvation
job even for a Government-aided Binghi.
* * * *
“Spug”: I note that Professor Navratil,
of Budapest, has suggested a scheme for
dealing with the millions of sparrows
which are infesting the public parks. He
suggests an apparatus for spraying them
with liquid air. This would freeze their
wings to their bodies, and when they
dropped to the ground they could be
gathered up and used to make soup for
the deserving poor. The idea might be
adopted in Australia to deal with crows,
blowflies, politicians, prickly pear and
kindred curses. But none of these could
be used for soup, and where are we going
to get liquid air? Hot air is plentiful,
but the politicians would be as immune
from that as snakes are from their own
venom. There’s always a catch in these
brain-waves.
* * * *
“Samoyede”: Even accustomed Aus-
tralians would be dubious if one told
them that mails are run in Australia by
dog trains, such as are used in Northern
Canada and Asia. Yet it is a fact, though
there is only one such service, that on
the Kosciusko Plateau, where a daily
dog-mail plies over the 11 miles between
the hotel and the chalet at Charlotte’s
Pass, under the charge of Ray Adams.
The team is not made up of pure-bred
sledge dogs, but is efficient enough, for
more than once it has been utilised as
an ambulance to transport incapacitated
human passengers.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: “Akeake” (B. 9/8/'33) re-
fers to the Chathams as a favorite
nesting-place of the white-capped or
“shy” albatross. There is an island near
the Hunters in Bass Strait, known as
Albatross Island, which is also a haunt
of these birds, often called mollyhawks
by seamen, but really a smaller species
of albatross. On this island there is an
almost perpendicular hollow leading to
a cavern strewn with the bones of thou-
sands of ulbatross. It is thought that the
birds when sailing over the depression
would sometimes fly too low and lose
all the wind on which they were relying,
and so would flutter helplessly to the
ground, imprisoned by the steep rocks
as in a trap. The albatross cannot rise
from the level ground. It prefers to take
a swooping downward flight from the
edge of a cliff unless it can rise against
a strong wind from the point of a rock.
Clumsy on land and never seen to swim,
the larger species of albatross, measur-
ing anything up to 13|ft. from tip to tip,
may be found a thousand miles from
land. The secret of its strokeless and
apparently effortless circling flight was a
mystery till men on motorless gliders
found it possible to stay in the air for
hours on end by taking advantage of
momentary changes in wind.
BALLADE OF BUMMERS’ CREEK AND
BANGEMALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The other side the land, on fields afar,
Old camps are reawaking, week by week,
To long-forgotten sounds that never jar.
The lingo that the pick and hammer speak,
The drone of windlasses, the sob-and-squeak
Of 'shakers —once again they rise and fall.
Is anybody back at Bummers’ Creek,
It sets me wondering, or Bangemall?
By potholes sunk long since once more they,
are;
Again for what their fathers sought they seek;
Their beat’s from Higginsvillc to Marble Bar,
The Feather to the Horseshoe or the Peak.
I glimpse retrodden Hampton Plains, and eke
The saltbush claims where ’finches used to call.
Do pegs go in anew at Bummers’ Creek?
Is anybody back at Bangemall?
Alluvial patches, seamed with gash and scar
A generation back, fresh trial bespeak;
They hitch their waggons to the same old star
As in those roaring days when strong and
weak
By tracks circuitous and ways oblique
Won to the goal or drifted to the wall.
Is there new life again at Bummers’ Creek,
It sets me wondering, or Bangemall?
Across auriferous belts once more they streak,
But in the finds re-found they overhaul
I find no mention yet of Bummers’ Creek,
No passing reference to Bangemall.

OLD0 LD Bulletin and Lone Hand readers cannot think of “Kodak” without a chuckle—his arguments
with Jimmy Pannikin” were once a feature of the Abo. page, and his BULLETIN and “Lone Hand”

“The Automatic Barmaid,” “Force of Habit,” etc.—is a laugh from beginning to end.

“Healesville”: Victoria is thinking of
establishing a zoo in the Dandenong
Ranges for native fauna only. There are
unused aboriginal reserves which might
be utilised most fittingly, since, having
practically extirpated homo sapiens Aus-
traliensis, it is up to us to try to pre-
serve other branches of our ferce natures.
Other States may be asked to contribute
characteristic specimens of their local
fauna, and the writer suggests that N.S.W.
might furnish some fine specimens of the
tin hare and that curious insect the ear-
biter.
* * * *
“Ped.”: According to Sydney’s Police
Commissioner, the number of motor fatali-
ties in N.S.W. is decreasing every year.
He gives no reason for this, but
writer is of opinion that Aus-
tralians are developing a kan-
garoo complex which assists
them to leap incredible distances
at a moment’s notice. I can
visualise the inhabitants of the
Mother State developing in the
future greatly extended and
more powerful lower limbs. I
have tried to envisage a pouch also, but
in vain. The average Australian is never
likely to have any need for a receptacle
of the kind, unless there’s an open season
for Income Tax Commissioners.
* * * *
“Corby”: The P.M.G.’s Department,
which always seems to be ready to try
anything once, is launching out as a
builder of excl. fits., e. 1., h. & c. w., all
mod. con. for magpies, believe it or not.
The magpie has a passion for building
nests on telegraph- and telephone-post
cross-arms, with the result that wires
are short-circuited and services upset.
A genius in the department has evolved
the idea of building special nests for the
fowls and placing them in such positions
on the cross-trees that they will not touch
the wires. Tentative experiments at the
expense of the inventor have proved that
the magpies greatly appreciate the
courtesy, and the department has re-
solved to build nests on a wholesale
scale. Of course, specifications will have
to be drawn up, sealed and approved,
and then made available for tenderers.
By the time the tenders have been sub-
mitted and accepted and the contracts
drawn up and let the nesting season will
be over, but what odds?
* * * *
“Dohori”: In these days of universal
anthropological lore I feel myself doubt-
ing whether primitive man differs at all
from the allegedly civilised variety. De-
scribing the ways of a New Guinea
tribe, a lady anthropologist dwelt on the
sufferings of the women, who, it seems,
are accustomed to be away all day from
their homes, and when they come home
tired and hungry are expected to cook
meals for their menfolk. Our own
womenfolk are in exactly the same posi-
tion when, after a long day’s golf or
bridge, they find a brute of a husband
howling for his dinner ; but no one holds
them up to pity in lectures. Further,
the “privileged men” of this tribe are
allowed “to stamp their feet and speak
loudly to their inferiors.” Substitute
“union bosses” for “privileged men” and
the ordinary Australian citizen and the
N.G. cannibal are brothers under their
skins. There is, however, one noticeable
difference. In New Guinea a man has to
be married and have four children be-
fore he is allowed to eat meat. In Aus-
tralia, a man in that predicament can’t
afford to eat meat.
* * * *
“Meat Preserver”: Seaweed jelly, men-
tioned as a Maori invention by “Akeake”
(B. 2/8/’33), is used for canning sheep’s
tongues. Best-known variety is a French
product known as agar, imported dried
in bales. There is a big market for it
at from 4s. to 6s. per pound, and if kar-
engo ( Durvillaea sp .) is a hard, white jelly,
as stated, it should be eminently suitable
for this purpose.
* * * *
“Macropus”: Victoria, which pretty
nearly succeeded at one time in extirpat-
ing the kangaroo, some years ago put
the remaining animals under strict pro-
tection. It has been found that in a few
years the hoppers have increased to such
an astonishing extent as to be a menace
to farming, and a system of district per-
mits to destroy them is now in force. Last
“ ’Struth! I seem to have put my foot in it!”
year some 25 of these mapped districts
were opened under careful restric-
tion. A limit is placed on the period of
destruction and the number destroyed.
Skins must be removed and marketed
at public auction by approved firms. Of
the proceeds 75 per cent, goes to the
man sending in the skins and the balance
to the Game and Fisheries Department,
which runs the show. Thus the farmer
profits both ways, by the removal of the
nuisance and the price of the skins.
* * * sjc
“Argee”: In the early days of the Ma
State it was an offence to strip stringy-
bark trees for building material, the
penalty being £1 per tree. The bark
made good roofing, and the settlers had
to have it. The law reserved the privi-
lege of bark-stripping to black brother,
so by bartering tucker and booze to
Binghi supplies were obtained. Naturally
liquor commanded the longest and widest
sheets. In the late ’seventies in southern
Queensland licenses to strip stringy-bark
had to be got from the police. Some-
one in authority believed that the white
fibre inside the bark could be used in-
stead of flax for the making of linen.
Two consignments were sent to Belfast
from Brisbane, but proved useless, so
the embargo was lifted.
* * * *
“Yacko”: “Mulyan” (B. 2/8/’33) in
his par. on early Murray navigation im-
plies that Randell’s ship, the Mary Ann,
lost the S.A. Government bonus to Cadell’s
Lady Augusta in a race to Swan Hill.
Randell missed the £4OOO premium by
not fulfilling conditions. A 40-h.p. en-
gine was specified, and Randell’s regis-
tered only 7 h.p. The turning point was
to be beyond the junction of the Darling
(551 miles from the Goolwa). Both
vessels exceeded the specified mileage.
The Lady Augusta turned at Swan Hill;
the Mary Ann 200 miles further on, at
Maiden’s Punt. The Government gave
the Randell brothers £3OO, and the pub-
lic subscribed £4OO ; but the Mary Ann
cost £lBOO to build.
* * • * *
“Mulyan”: Of the eight species of
white ants found around Sydney, only
one, the milk termite, is destructive to
wooden buildings. The hard, domed nests
of this pest, standing up to five feet above
the ground, were once numerous about
the Hawkesbury and its neighborhood,
but are now scarce. The disappearance
has been caused by the use of the
nests for tennis courts and the floors of
sheds, as the material sets like cement.
Similar use of the termites’ masonry is
made in other parts of the State and in
Queensland, and this continual interfer-
ence with their domestic arrangements
is tending to wipe them out. Closer
settlement in the far North, where the
magnetic nests, ranging from dumplings
to miniature Matterhorns, are in thou-
sands, would doubtless do the same.
Wherever the nests are handy they have
a value, and the future may see the count-
less piles of the North bagged and loaded
into trains.
*** . *
“Sailor”: While recruiting in the Sulka
country, New Britain, I remembered the
request of an anthropological friend for
a skull from that area. After coming
on a village and plying my legitimate
trade without success I decided to sound
the luluai about the skull, but he’d gone
religious for a while and was loafing
down at the mission. His deputy, the
tul-tul (limb of the Territory law), a
shady-looking old hound, minus a hand
(an accident brought about by the illegal
use of dynamite), seemed the meet in-
strument for this transaction. When 1
offered him payment in tobacco he didn’t
know that such things as skulls existed,
but by the time I had reached three
shillings his memory had taken a big
sweep. With a lot of mysterious wink-
ings and noddings, and binding me to
secrecy as concerned the members of his
tribe and the kiap (the district patrol
officer), he went off into the bush. He
returned about a quarter of an hour later
with the grisly object in a bon-bon bas-
ket. I asked him whose grave he had
robbed. Without a blush on his cun-
ning old mug he told me it was his
brother’s, and that I could have the rest
of the bones for another bob. I assured
the old ghoul that what was left of his
brother’s frame could rest in peace.
* * * *
“Frig.”: An animal hideous enough to
cause nightmares has been sent in a
bottle of spirits to the Queensland
Museum from Camooweal. He is Mac-
roderma gigas, also known as the false
vampire bat, a combination of vice and
malice that preys on his near relatives,
young frogs, birds and insects. He has
long sharp teeth in a camel-like mouth ;
his ears are about 2in. long, white and
ghostly. His smelling apparatus is on
top, looking like soft bone. His wings,
whitish in color, span a foot when
stretched. The creature is found only
in Centralia and Central Q.
* * *
“Übique”: “Cooramin’s” theory (B.
9/ 8/ ’33) that brumbies originated from
the settlement at Port Essington in 1840
is open to question. When Captain
Barker evacuated the military settlement
at Raffles Bay in 1829 because it had
failed to encourage trading visits from
the Malays he abandoned “for the bene-
fit of future settlers” a Timor horse and
a mare in foal. Searcey, who, some 50
years ago, was captured by and lived
with the blacks of the Northern Territory,
reports having come across a glade where
he discovered a herd of about 50 wild
ponies, undoubtedly of Timor origin."
* * * *
“Homfrey Beale”: A palatable damper
was made by the old-time abos. from
seeds of the wild orange. This tree (Cap-
paris) is plentiful in north-west N.S.W.,
and in my kidhood days I often sampled
with relish the pastry made by the lubras
from the crushed seeds of the fruit. Later
on I tried it a couple of times round
Pine Creek, near Darwin, where the tree
grows nearer to perfection and the fruit
seeds are consequently more juicy and
highly flavored. The taste of the cakes
round there was faintly sweet, with a sug-
gestion of aloes thrown in. The gins
crushed the seeds between flat stones,
made a dough by adding water and
moulded it into little flat, circular cakes.
These were laid on a piece of bark and
left for a couple of hours in the sun,
which made them rise a little. Finally
they were baked in hot ashes for about
half an hour.
* * * $
“Barangkali”: The nests from which
birds’-nest soup is made are those of the
swifts, and are obtained from limestone
caves in Malaya and Borneo. During
the nesting season the birds have a plenti-
ful supply of glutinous saliva that dries
hard and quickly when being worked into
the shape of the nests. The Malays have
a superstition that the saliva is dried sea
foam, and is collected from the surf when
the swifts skim their way over the
breakers returning from their yearly
migration. The smaller swifts weave
moss and down into their homes. First-
quality nests bring about £8 a thousand,
and last year the trade was worth £25,000
to Malaya.
THE OLD HAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenever I take a trip to town
I make a point of going to see
Some old mate who has settled down,
Cobber who worked in the bush with me;
One who reckoned a country life
Only fit for an anchorite;
Wanted a “city job,” “a wife,”
“Somewhere to spend his time at night.”
Talk of old times makes the minutes fly
Until I finish with “Getting late;
Time I went, so I’ll say good-bye.”
Then, as he stands at the garden gate,
Fumbling awkwardly with the latch,
After saying the night is fine,
Comes a whisper I barely catch,
“Ever see that old girl of mine?”
Always sorry to say good-bye,
He shuts the gate and goes back inside.
What he asked for he got, but I
Wonder whether he’s satisfied.
Clang of hurrying tramcar’s gong,
Strident clamor of motor-horn —
Are these as sweet as the bushbird’s song
Al ter rain in the early morn?
Back in the bush, my day’s work done,
Sometimes on soft, warm moonlight nights
Round my hut on a western run
Beckoning come the city sights.
But when the faces of friends who stare
Wistfully into mine draw nigh,
Closing the door, I whisper “There
But for the grace of God go I.”

This is the cause of your
Backache
U H! OH! my back—it’s nearly breaking! I can’t get straight again
M once 1 stoop down. It seems just as though an iron hand is
I gripping me, wrenching the muscles, making me just sick with
pain. ...” That is the daily story of a host of people just crippled
with pain. Thousands of women—and men, too —suffer for years
with chronic pains in the back, and believe it is due to sudden cold, a chill or
too much work or fatigue. As a matter of fact, the stabbing, weakening,
lowering backache, that dreadful down-dragging weakness is almost certainly
due to hidden kidney trouble.
There are thousands of men and women suffering daily "untold agonies
because of kidney trouble in one form or another. It is no use doping the system
with drugs. The only possible means of ending your trouble is to cleanse the
body of pain-giving poisons, and that is a function the kidneys must carry out.
It is the testimony of not one but thousands of one-time sufferers, backed
by our own 40 years’ experience, which enables us to state that if. you will
commence a course with a simple straightforward remedy, De Witt s Kidney
and Bladder Pills, your pain and weakness will be ended.
In 24 hours you will see results. Persevere and your pain goes for good.
Why forego the pleasures of life? Why continue in constant nerve-destroying
pain? Why be weak and ailing when you can, at such little cost, start once
again building up full vigour and vitality?
No extravagant claims are made for these pills. They do not represent a
cure-all, craze-of-the-moment find. Solid testimony proves their efficacy in all
complaints which
ate caused by weak
or sluggish kidneys,
especially backache,
rheumatism, bladder
trouble and general
weakness.

What were the circumstances of the Tich-
borne case ? —7502.
On May 11, 1871, Arthur Orton, who claimed
to be the missing Sir Roger Charles Tich-
borne, commenced proceedings to establish his
right to the Tichborne estate. The hearing
lasted until March 6, 1872, having occupied 103
days, when Orton’s counsel elected to be non-
suited. The cost to the estate was £90,000. The
claimant was arrested and tried for perjury and
forgery. The trial began April 23, 1872, and was
not concluded until February 28, 1874, when
Orton was sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment.
He was released on ticket-of-leave in 1884 and
some years later made a written confession,
(1 ) Is a girl of 14 who is diabetic and under
insulin treatment eligible for the invalid pen-
sion ? (2) Does the granting of the pension
depend on the parents’ income ? If so, what
is the minimum parental income that would
debar the granting of the pension ? —7346.
(1) No. A qualification for the invalid
pension is that the claimant must have attained
the age of 16. (2) Section 22H of the Act pro-
vides that no person shall receive an invalid
pension unless his relatives do not adequately
maintain him. Circumstances of parents are
taken into account. Each case is dealt with on
its merits.
(1) When was the “holey dollar” in circula-
tion in New South Wales ? (2) What was the
value of the “dump” and the other part of the
coin ? —7494.
(1) On Nov. 26, 1812, the sloop of war
Samarang arrived at Sydney from India with
£lO,OOO in dollars for the Government. To
prevent their being taken away a circular piece
was cut out of each coin; known as the dump.
(2) The value given to the dollar ring was ss.
and to the piece removed Is. 3d.
In view of Douglas Maw son’s advice to Aus-
tralia to develop Antarctic whale fisheries, what
has the industry been worth to Australia ?
7497.
In 1826, the earliest year for which returns
are available, the value of whale oil, etc., ex-
ported from N.S.W. was £34,850; in 1840,
£224,144; after that date the exports steadily
decreased until in 1860 (where the records stop)
the value was down to £136.
I have a large deposit of red ochre about 23
miles from Melbourne. It contains 55 p.c. of
ferric oxide and 25 p.c. oxide of silica. Has
it a marketable value ? —7218.
The value of ochre for use as a pigment in
paint manufacture depends mainly upon ferric
oxide content, color and condition. It may
contain 55 p.c. ferric oxide and yet be unsuit-
able as a pigment owing to hard condition or
an unfavorable tint. Submit a representative
sample of about 101 b. to the Mines Department,
Melbourne.
(1) If a thin wire is anchored vertically on
a horizontal surface, and the position of the
shadow thrown by this wire at noon is marked
on the surface by a line drawn from the bottom
end of the wire along the shadow, will it
always be exactly noon when the shadow co-
incides with the line ? (2) If not, will there be
a regular variation, which can be allowed for
in order to calculate noon on any day ? (3)
What amount of variation would there be in a
year ? —7183.
(1) No. (2) The variation will be irregular
from day to day, and no short formula for
correction can be given. (3) About 31 minutes.
(1) Cost and length of a course in dramatic
art if taken at some good academy in Sydney ?
(2) Would removal of tonsils impair or improve
a baritone voice? —7304.
(1) Depends upon previous training and
aptitude. A personal interview with an experi-
enced teacher is suggested. (2) Impossible to
foresee what the effect of such an operation
would be.
(1) Nearest portion of the Barrier Reef from
Sydney and how reached by road from Sydney ?
(2) Any drinking water available on the Reef ?
(3) Fishing tackle required for a short stay ?
(4) Do fish caught there keep longer than in
other parts ? —733Q.
(1) Heron Island, reached from Gladstone,
is the nearest portion. N.S.W. tourists have
the choice of coastal and inland routes. From
Brisbane to Gladstone the best road is via the
inland route, through Ipswich and Nanango.
(2) The only fresh water on Heron Island is
in tanks belonging to Barrier Reef Tours, Ltd.,
Gladstone, and their permission would have to
be obtained before water could be used. (3)

(1) What were the total expenses for an adult
Boy Scout to go to the jamboree in Hungary ?
(2) Length of absence from Australia ? (3)
When and where is next jamboree to be held ?
(4) Does the Education Department of N.S.W.
allow a teacher leave to go to the jamboree ?
(5) Qualifications for Scout to attend ? —7443.
(1) £125, excluding pocket money. (2) The
contingent left Sydney on June 24 and is ex-
pected to return late in November. (3) Loca-
tion and date are decided by the International
Bureau, and such decision is not made until
the year previous to the holding of the jam-
boree. (4) The granting of leave to a teacher
is entirely a matter for the Education Depart-
ment. (5) Qualifications for the present jam-
boree are: Scouts of the age of 15 years or
over and of first-class rank; parents’ sanction
and medical certificate required.
(1) Was Woolloomooloo the original name for
Darlinghurst, Sydney ? (2) Is the present spell-
ing of Woolloomooloo the way the aborigines
pronounced it ? —7500.
(1) No. (2) The native name of the cove now
known as Woolloomooloo was “Wallabah-
mullah,” meaning a young male black kan-
garoo. Another name was “Wallamullah,”
meaning a place of plenty, or where fish were
caught.

ture in the 20- to 60 -h.p. range; h.p., weight
and type in each case; also names and
addresses of Australian agents ? —7354.

A.D.9, 46 to 48 h.p., 1601 b.; agents not known.
What is the history of the old dismantled
fort which stands on the northern head of
Botany Bay ? —7263.
It was built on Bare Island in 1881 on the
recommendation of Sir William Jervois. In
1891 a Royal Commission found that the work
had been carried out “in a most disgraceful
way.” The place was converted into a home
for veterans in 1912.
Is tar a good preservative for galvanised-iron ?
—7004.
No. It contains acids which corrode iron,
and almost any sort of paint is a better pre-
servative.
What was the first attempt made by any Gov-
ernment in Australia to educate the aborigines
in schools? —7sl6.
In December, 1814, Governor Macquarie
established a school for abo. children at Par-
ramatta. About 20 attended. Later the school
was used for the teaching of white children,
and complaints by their parents of the un-
pleasant habits of the native youngsters led
to its being closed.
(1) In what year did the big gold-rushes com-
mence in Australia ? (2) What increase in popu-
lation followed as a direct result ? —7520.
(1) In May, 1851, the first disclosed goldfield
caused a rush in New South Wales. In July of
the same year gold was discovered in various
parts of Victoria. Towards the end of Oct.,
1851, there were 10,000 men on the Ballarat
field. (2) Can’t say as to direct consequence.
In 1852 nearly 100,000 persons arrived at Port
Phillip, 92,000 in 1853, 150,000 in 1854. In
less than four years a Vic. population of 80,000
people had increased to 420,000.
(1) When did steam ferries start running in
Port Jackson, between Sydney and the North
Shore ? (2) What class of vessels were they,
and what were their names ? —7527.
(1) In March, 1841, when a wooden steam
punt began plying from Windmill-street, The
Rocks, to North Shore. Fare, 3d. This ser-
vice lasted for 15 months. (2) The first punt
was named the Princess. It was followed by
Ferry Queen, The Brothers, and the Agenoria,
in that order. All were paddle-steamers.
Why, and in what year, was Matthew Flinders
imprisoned by the French Government ? —7533.
He was on his way from Australia to Eng-
land in 1803 after surveying unexplored shores
of this continent when he was held at the Isle
of France (Mauritius) by General de Caen,
apparently acting under orders from the French
Government, which claimed, by right of dis-
covery, certain portions of the southern coast
of Australia. Flinders was held prisoner for
seven years.
(1) Was Seymour Haden a doctor as well
as an artist ? (2) What was his connection with
Whistler ? (3) Anything more of interest about
him ? —7514.
(1) Yes. (2) He married Whistler’s sister.
(3) He was founder and president of the first
Royal Society of Painter-Etchers; received his
knighthood for services to art in 1894 and was
a Foreign Member of the Institut de France
and of the Academie des Beaux-Arts. On two
occasions he was awarded the Grand Prix.
Why is the ace of spades called the ace of
trouble ?— 7484.
Exact origin of usage is unknown. It is the
symbol of death or misfortune in almost all
systems of fortune-telling by cards, and there
are many instances of the employment of “Black
Jack” as a symbol for trouble in fact and fic-
tion.
How to grow Christmas-bush from seeds, and
when to sow ? —7538.
Sow the seed in deep boxes in bush-soil
(preferably sandy loam which contains much
wood-ash). Seed will germinate at any time
of the year, but best results are obtained if
sown in January. A glass frame will help the
young plants. When the seedlings are in their
second leaf prick them out into small pots
and shelter them with hessian until they are
established. Don’t be alarmed if the shrub
makes very slow growth.
Crank-shaft speed of an Austin 7 engine,
1927 model, when the car is travelling at a road
speed of (a) 20 m.p.h,; (b) 25 m.p.h.; (c)
30 m.p.h. ? Standard tyres are fitted. —7489.
(a) 1333 r.p.m.; {b) 1667 r.p.m.; (c) 2000
r.p.m.
How to make a frame to protect seedlings
from cats ? —7558.
Bend |in. iron in a half-circle the width of
the seed-boxes and cover it with |in. mesh
wire-netting. This will allow the rain and drew
to fall on the plants. If the boxes are placed
on a frame 3ft. off the ground slugs and snails
will be kept off.
Best method of watering pot-plants ? Should
fertilisers be used when doing the work ?
7550.
Place the pots in a tub or cask with the
water just to the brim of the pots and keep
them there until the air bubbles cease rising
to the surface. Although it will help the
plants to add a teaspoonful of sulphate of
ammonia to each gallon of water it is prefer-
able to use the special pills and powders, which
are mixed scientifically.
(1) 1 have two pen drawings and etchings by
W. N. Utwick. The scenes are English, and they
have been in my possession for 25 years. Is
this artist well known and what is the value of
the drawings ? (2) How can a pen-drawing be
distinguished from an etching? —744l.
(1) Unable to trace any reference to him.
The value would be slight. (2) An etching is
printed from a metal plate, and is formed of
slightly-raised lines. A plate mark, consisting
of a sunken line right round the print near the
margins, will also be apparent. Pen-drawings
as a general rule both look and feel quite flat
on the surface.
Is William Muldoon, once heavyweight cham-
pion wrestler of the world and manager of John
L. Sullivan, still chairman of the New York
Boxing Commission ? Can you tell me some-
thing about his later years ? —7384.
He was chairman until a few weeks before
his death on June 4 last. He amassed a for-
tune with his “good health” farm at Purchase,
N.Y., and died of cancer at 89.
Imports, exports, net imports, quantity on
which excise duty was paid, and total for home
consumption of petroleum and shale spirit, in-
cluding benzine, for (1) Australia and (2) West-
ern Australia for the years 1931-32 and 1932-33 ?
—7OlB.
(1) 1931-32: Imports, 156,026,719 galls.; ex-
ports, 162,935 galls.; net imports, 155,863,784
galls.; quantity on which excise duty was paid,
19,044,324 galls.; total for home consumption,
174,908,108 galls. 1932-33 : Imports, 180,966,726
galls.; exports, 1,751,682 galls.; net imports,
179,215,044 galls.; quantity on which excise duty
was paid, 20,130,000 galls, (estimated); total for
home consumption, 199,345,044 galls. (2)
1931- Imports (net, no exports), 12,935,057
galls.; total for home consumption, the same.
1932- : Imports (net, no exports), 15,554,407
galls.; total for home consumption, the same.
Has there been any period, since the United
States were formed, when the republic has been
without a President ? —7557.
Yes, as many periods as there have been
Presidents, since it has always been the custom
that a retiring President’s term ends at mid-
night, and that the incoming President does
not take the oath till 12 hours later.
(1) Is there any record of the preferences of
Beethoven among the composers ? (2) Is there
any evidence that he closely studied the works
of his contemporaries ? —7257.
(1) Records are fragmentary and of doubtful
authenticity. Best authenticated is that of
Stumpff, a harp-maker, who held a conversa-
tion with the composer in 1824, when Beet-
hoven was stone-deaf. According to Stumpff,
who says he wrote his questions in “very dis-
tinct letters,” Beethoven placed Handel above
all other composers. Of Mozart he said “He
is good and admirable.” Beethoven’s reply,
in response to an interpolation by Stumpff
that J. S. Bach was dead but would return
again, was “Yes, if he is studied; but for that
there is no more time.” Stumpff records that
the only Handel scores Beethoven had seen
were those of “Messiah” and “Alexander’s
Feast.” On his deathbed Beethoven, visited by
Schubert, said of the latter “You, Franz, have
my soul.” (2) No. Beethoven’s continual com-
plaint in his latter years was that he was unable
to afford music.
How does a player-piano work ? —7454.
The process is pneumatic. Corresponding to
each note on the instrument there is a narrow
tube whose aperture is uncovered when a per-
foration passes over it. Each tube communi-
cates with a chamber in which the air is at a
pressure below that of the atmosphere. The
uncovering of the aperture allows atmospheric
air to rush into this chamber and set in opera-
tion a lever that causes the hammer to strike
the note. Air exhaustion is affected either by
a pedal pump or by an electric motor.
In a book about the London waterfront l
came across a reference to a place called “The
Queen’s Tobacco Pipe.” What is meant ?
7468.
It is a kiln situated at the London Docks,
in which tobacco and other contraband goods
are destroyed.
(1) Where and when was Jack Carroll, welter-
weight champion of Australia, born ? (2) How
long has Carroll been boxing and is that his
correct name ? —7463.
(1) Kensington, Vic., 1907. (2) He began
boxing in 1924. His correct name is Hardwick.
Information concerning John Constable, the
English painter ? —7467.
Born 1776, died 1837, he was son of a
Suffolk mill-owner. He excelled as a landscape
painter. First exhibited at the Royal Academy
in 1802. Associate of Academy 1819. In
1821 he gained a gold medal at the Paris Salon
for “The Hay Wain.” He is specially noted
for his skies just before a storm. His most
important works are “The Leaping Horse”
(1825), “The Cornfield” (1827) and “Dedham
Vale” (1828).
How is iron galvanised ? —7451.
The iron is pickled for six to eight hours in
water containing 1 p.c. sulphuric acid, and then
washed and kept immersed in clean water in
which a little fresh burnt lime has been stirred.
It is then immersed in chloride of zinc for one
or two minutes until a skin of fine bubbles has
formed on the surface, dried on a heated iron
plate and dipped in a bath of molten zinc (not
glowing) until the metal acquires the tempera-
ture of the zinc bath. The surface of the zinc
is protected by sal-ammoniac.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S MEAL
A NEW SORT OF FIELD DAY.
“Argee”: A new way of arousing in-
terest in pasture improvement, invented
by Clothier, the agrostologist at the ex-
perimental farm at Glen lnnes (N.S.W.),
takes the form of a field day at one of the
many farms in his district where experi-
mental pasture plots have been estab-
lished.
There are five such farms near Tenter-
field. To these machinery firms are in-
vited to bring suitable machines for de-
monstration purposes, and to send their
own representative to lecture on the
work. A suitable paddock having been
chosen, each machine works a strip of
ground sufficiently wide and close
enough to the others for the different
results to be readily observed.
So as to reduce to a minimum the
transport of machinery and save the time
of the demonstrators, each town is
worked in proper order to a schedule.
Mr. Clothier organises the transport
of the machines from place to place, so
that the demonstrators have only to
appear at the various farms, where they
find everything ready for them. Local
teams are hired to haul the machines.
Proof of the interest this new method
is arousing was seen at Tenterfield
recently, when five machinery firms de-
monstrated 30 machines, and a large
number of landowners, big and small,
assembled from within a radius of 40
miles to listen to lectures on pasture im-
provement by the leading agrostologists
of the Agriculture Department.
PASTURE IMPROVEMENT.
“Lion”: With wheat prices so low it
would pay the grower to put a portion
of his cultivation paddocks down to suit-
able grasses, and carry and fatten all
classes of stock. This type of land has
for some years been a repository for all
manner of weeds, which have gradually
increased. It needs far more care and
preparation than virgin land.
Sow grasses before local weeds get
going. This gives the young plants a
chance to smother the weeds out. Your
Agricultural Department will give all
the information you require as to the
most suitable grasses for your own class
of country.
Do not be in a hurry to stock heavily,
but rather stock just enough to “prune”
the growing grasses and allow them to
stool out well. Allow the grasses to seed
down themselves. It will pay you hand-
somely in the long run. How much, or
how little, you can stock depends on the
season and the growth ; but always stock
heavily enough to beat weed growth.
Get a good strong and pure sample
of seed, even if you have to pay more.
Sow the grasses at the time that suits
them best, and don’t stock before they
are thoroughly established.
Some grasses can be sown in conjunc-
tion with wheat, and if you could not
afford to lose a crop this might be done.
It is not as satisfactory as sowing them
on their own. The wheat plant tends to
starve the grasses.
If unlucky enough to get a bad ger-
mination, plough it up and sow again.
LIME YOUR LAND.
“B. Ware”: Farmers and graziers still
argue about spreading lime on their pro-
perties. The question for the most part
is little understood and therefore is not
tackled in a proper manner.
There are many farmers and graziers
all over Australia who make it a prac-
tice to lime their pastures prior to apply-
ing the usual hundredweight dressing of
super., but the dressings of lime applied
in these cases are light, and cannot be
regarded as liming in the true sense of
the word.
Even then does it pay?
Good grade agricultural lime is now
available in Victoria at 12s. 6d. per ton,
f.0.r., but it costs considerably more than
this to freight the stuff 300 miles and
over.
Some say agricultural lime should be
in a very fine powder so that it will dis-
solve readily, and therefore in permeating
the soil it quickly neutralises the acidity.
This may be so —I don’t know —but one
thing is certain: a dressing of lime in mild
form improves the quality and the digesti-
bility of the pasture, and all the good that
thereafter flows is due to lime irrespec-
tive of whether the mild lime be in the
condition of sand or icing sugar.
Lime, when in a very fine state, sails
away in the slightest wind during spread-
ing, and washes through and away out
of the soil during heavy rain, so that the
cocky need not be as fussy about the fine-
ness of the agricultural lime he wishes
to buy as he is about its cheapness.
Instead of trying to calculate whether
the liming operation is an economical
proposition per medium of crop yield
or beasts carried per acre over a period,
let him observe the general health of his
herd or flock, the improvement in his
young stock, the insistent demand at im-
proved prices for his springers and the
greatly-enhanced value of his holding,
due not only to the facts enumerated, but
to the general appearance of the various
paddocks, to soil improvement and fac-
tors associated therewith, following the
admirable and all-too-scanty practice of
applying agricultural or natural lime to
the soil.
The quantity recommended per acre?
As much as you can afford. Make a
job of it, and apply tons per acre so that
first cost is last cost.
There are holdings in Victoria which
were limed 35 years ago with 25 loads
of chalk per acre, and on which the bene-
fit is still pronounced, even although lime
in any shape or form has been withheld
from the paddocks ever since.
BURYING PRUNINGS.
“P. Aitch”: Vine prunings—or any
prunings—have a fairly high ash (min-
eral) content, which consists mainly of
potash and lime, associated with every
mineral element that the plant has ex-
tracted from the soil.
The ash of prunings is, therefore, of
value to the M.O.L. The usual thing is
to burn them, collecting the ash and
spreading it broadcast around the trees
or vines.
“Woorinen” (B. 14/6/’33) tells of a
system under which prunings from a vine-
yard are buried in trenches 2ft. deep
which are dug between the rows of vines.
I well remember in the days of my
youth watching the men employed by
the hardy pioneers of Gippsland digging
miles of drains 3ft. deep, which were
immediately half-filled with brushwood
and then covered in with soil.
The idea was to improve drainage.
Never a thought of the value of the de-
composed brushwood or its ash content
acting as a fertiliser or soil-improver.
The brushwood drains worked like a
charm for several years, and then gradu-
ally became more or less blocked, until
finally it became a case of “as you were.”
In those times a man was lucky to get
a pound a week and keep, and therefore
the cost of the brush drain was not a
big item.
Whether the policy of burying prun-
ings, as suggested by “Woorinen,” is
advisable or not will depend upon the
cost and the soil type. It certainly would
not pay any vigneron to plough a trench
2ft. deep to dispose of his prunings when
the sole consideration was manurial
value. On the other hand, while it is
admitted that vine prunings are far in
advance of brushwood for use in under-
ground drains, my own view is that a
permanent tile drain is better, the prun-
ings being burnt and broadcast.
KINDNESS AND HORSES.
“H.C.M.”: Kindness pays with horses.
Of the many different ways of taming or
quietening a prad,- from starving him in
a yard to galloping him to a standstill,
I have proved the following to be
unfailing:
Be gentle with the animal when
caught; be quiet when handling him.
Even if he has led you a dance before
yarding him, don’t lose your temper
when you have caught him and flog him.
This will often spoil an animal for life.
At first, whilst he is hard even to
approach, feed him on “choice morsels”
such as a bit of bread, handfuls of bran,
wheat, oats, or anything a horse likes
especially. Take the trouble to fondle
him and speak to him so that he knows
your voice. Exercise patience and
commonsense whilst riding or driving
him. Don’t be unduly harsh, yet show
your mastery of him.
Later on approach him in the paddock
when you don’t wish to use him, and
again give him something to eat. This
is very little extra trouble and makes all
the difference. Kindness, patience and a
little bread, etc., will work wonders; per-
haps I should add perseverance as well.
I have quietened horses that took two
men to yard and saddle by this method;
I got them so that if I whistled they
would whinny and come up to me day
or night.
DINGO POISONING.
“H. de WHere’s how I used to
destroy dingoes when I was out on the
Paroo.
Cut sheep-liver into pieces about
an inch square, put into a 71b. “cocky’s
joy” tin, and three-parts fill with
water. Close tin till contents ripen
(usually in about 10 days or so). When
ready, make up 12 or 15 baits —usually
kidney fat and strychnine, say, 2in. by
approx, lin. square. Put a nail hole
in the side of the tin about lin. from the
top and drip the “decoy” over the back
of the sulky. Then drop a bait—prefer-
ably near- a grass tussock —and, without
getting out of the sulky, make a mark
on the track with a stick and carry on
until all the baits and decoy are used. I
never missed a catch with this method.
If after foxes, use galahs or cockatoo
parrots (Quarriaus) for baits, and only
put the powdered strychnine in their
heads ; but use the same decoy.
In the cow-cocky country three or four
rabbits well singed and trailed from
horseback will serve as a decoy, and I
use lin. cube baits dosed with powdered
strychnine.
1934 SYDNEY ROYAL SHOW.
Several changes have been made in the
prize schedules and conditions for the
1934 Royal Show by the sectional com-
mittees of the R.A.S. The district com-
petition will in future have six competi-
tors, the Hunter River and Northern Dis-
trict being the new one, and the scale of
points has been revised. Five points have
been deducted from lard and edible
fats and added to eggs ; 10 points have
been taken from dried fruits and added
tp fresh fruits; 10 points taken from
barley will be divided between culinary
vegetables and sweet potatoes. The num-
ber of varieties of potatoes will be limited
to 10. Broom millet and sugar have
each lost five points to grasses and merino
wool.
Wheat judging will also be carried
out on a new basis, 100 points being
allotted on quality and 100 on milling.
As a result of experiments by the De-
partment of Agriculture a new classifica-
tion of wheat strengths will appear in
the prize schedule. Dogs will also re-
ceive the benefit of some new ideas.
There will be four one-day sessions, in-
stead of three sessions of two days each,
and on Easter Monday challenge and
first-prize winners will compete for higher
honors.
Score-card judging competitions for
Clydesdale horse, dairy cow, bacon
pig, wheat, maize and potatoes, open
to students of agricultural schools and
colleges, will be conducted. In the pig
section a number of new classes have
been provided for Large Yorkshires. The
classes for Welsh cob stallion and hack-
ney pony or cob mare have been deleted
from the horse section, but additional
classes have been arranged for ponies
not exceeding 11 hands. The Show will
begin on March 26 and finish on April 4.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
How to eradicate Cape tulip? —7l33.
The eradication of Cape tulip is diffi-
cult. If conditions permit, good tillage
will keep it in check, but otherwise spray-
ing with a sodium chlorate solution is
the only effective treatment available.
And it is expensive.
My cow has commenced to drink lub-
ricating oil. Is this due to a lack of some-
thing in her diet ? If so, what do you
suggest should be given to her ? —7426.
Possibly due to a lack of mineral sup-
plements in the diet. It is suggested that
the following lick be made available:
Salt 611 b., bone flour 301 b., sulphur 51b.,
magnesium sulphate 31b., sulphate of iron
(fine) lib., potassium iodide loz. and
manganese sulphate loz.
A calf nine months old suffers from a
complaint the symptoms of which are
short muscular spasms, grinding of the
teeth ( pronounced ), losing hair in patches
on the shoulders and general debility.
Cause and cure? —7471.
From the above meagre information it
is rather difficult to diagnose definitely.
Some of the symptoms shown are sug-
gestive of mineral deficiency, which may
be corrected by allowing the animal
access to a lick consisting of bonemeal
and salt equal parts, or supplying two
ounces of bonemeal in the daily ration.
(1) Does corkscrew grass reduce the
carrying capacity of a property ? (2)
What is its feeding value (a) before com-
ing into seed, (b) when dry and seeded in
February ? (3) What effect would top-
dressing with lcwt. superphosphate to
the acre have on it? Would it encour-
age other grasses to come, or increase
the growth of corkscrew ? (4) What
method of treatment would eradicate
same ? (5) Would Wimmera rye-grass
or lucerne grow in the Deniliquin
( N.S.W .) district; and, if so, what quantity
of seed of each do you suggest per acre,
when to plant and quantity of fertiliser
to use ? —6844.
(1) It does if it takes possession of
grazing land. When this grass is in seed
it causes considerable damage to animals
grazing through seeds entering their
flesh. (2) In its young stages of growth
corkscrew grass provides good-quality
feed for sheep and cattle, but when
in seed and at a later stage of
maturity is innutritious. (3) Top-
dressing the area with lcwt. superphos-
phate per acre in the autumn of every
second year will encourage the clovers
to thrive, and by seeding profusely a
gradual thickening up of these plants and
the softer grasses will result. Perennial
native grasses, such as corkscrew, do not
respond as readily to superphosphate as
annual herbage plants of the nature of
clover burr, crowfoot, Wimmera rye,
etc., and, as only a small dressing of fer-
tiliser is recommended, the growth of the
corkscrew would not be increased to any
great extent. (4) Ploughing is the best
method to adopt. (5) On friable, deep
soils a mixture of Wimmera rye 31b. and
lucerne 21b. per acre should be sown in
the autumn with fcwt. to lcwt. super-
phosphate per acre.
The best way to destroy lice on cattle ?
—7359.
Dip the animals (if in a tick area) in
the ordinary arsenious dip fluid. If not
in such an area, use cottonseed oil and
kerosene in equal parts or spray with 10
per cent kerosene emulsion. Kerosene
emulsion may be prepared as follows:
Cut into small pieces one pound of hard
soap. Add one gallon of water and
simmer over a slow fire until soap is dis-
solved. Remove from the fire, and, while
hot, add one pint of kerosene. Stir
thoroughly until the dressing becomes of
a creamy consistency.
Would tobacco grow in the Maranoa
( Q .) district by irrigating from a bore
drain, and does frost affect it? —7126.
Climatic conditions in the Maranoa dis-
trict would probably not suit the cultiva-
tion of tobacco. The crop is very
adversely affected by frost.
(1) How to obtain nicotine from
tobacco-leaf ? (2) Is there a market for
nicotine ? (3) Price ? (4) Quantity of
leaf required ? (5) Would one be able to
pay for the leaf, say, 2d. or 3d. a pound ?
(6) I am able to get a few tons of leaf
and would like advice re the marketing
of the nicotine. —7214.
(1) By boiling the leaf and stalk and
reducing condensation from 40 per cent,
to 45 per cent, nicotine. (2) A limited
market; A.C.F. and Shirleys, Ltd., Bris-
bane, and Buzacotts, Ltd., Sydney, are
buyers. (3) Suggest that you get in touch
with the firms mentioned, but the price
would, of course, depend on the quality
of the product. (4) This depends entirely
upon the class of leaf used. Naturally
rank-growing tobacco leaf would yield
more than the cigarette type. (5) No.
(6) Refer to information given under (2).
Speaking generally, experts consulted
think that your idea of using practically
waste leaf of light types of tobacco is
not possible.
Could turkeys be profitably run on
about 25 acres of good grassland on the
coast of N.S.W. ? How many birds are
required for a beginning? Where could
information be obtained ? —7342.
Twenty-five acres devoted solely to
turkey-raising would be unlikely to pay,
because most of the .feed would have
to be purchased. Turkey-raising is a good
adjunct to wheat-farming or grazing,
where unlimited free range is available.
Drier inland districts are more suitable,
but turkeys can be raised on the coast.
The best way to start is with one or
more breeding pens, according to the
number of poults it is desired to raise.
Leaflet on turkey-raising is obtainable
from N.S.W. Agricultural Dept.
Does the Q’land Agricultural Depart-
ment recommend the use of crude oil as
a spray for citrus pest control ? —7057.
No.
What should I do with lemons which
are hard when I pick them ? —7249.
The hardness may be due to the fact
that the tree is of a poor type or the
fruit may have been left too long on the
tree. The fruit is best picked not later
than when it is just commencing to turn
yellow ; the stalk should then be trimmed
back flush with the button and the fruit
stored in a humid, airy place, where the
skin will lose its turgid condition and
acquire color. If not then used at once
ventilation should be reduced to prevent
excessive drying. Where only one or
two trees are grown, it is sometimes satis-
factory merely to pick and trim the fruit
and place it in a tray on the ground under
the shade of the branches.

Two Certain Stand-bys
in a Country of Uncertain Rainfall
In good seasons and bad, Meggitt’s Linseed Sheep Nuts
and Meggitt’s Linseed Oil Meal, with their content of
laxative medicinal linseed oil, prove their value to the man
on the land.
In times of drought, thousands of sheep are supported on
Meggitt’s Linseed Sheep Nuts—while stud breeders use
them at all times. (Practically all the sheep at the 1933
Sheep Show, Sydney, were fed on Meggitt’s Linseed
Sheep Nuts.)
In the dairying field, not only are such world-famous cows
as “Wagga Gladys” fed on Meggitt’s Linseed Oil Meal,
but also ordinary grade herds, the owners of which find
that the consequent increase in production pays them a
handsome profit over feeding costs. (94% of the dairy and
beef stock at the 1933 Royal Agricultural Show, Sydney,
were fed on Meggitt’s Linseed Oil Meal.)

WHEN LIVING WAS CHEAP
YEARS ago, when living was cheap, many men assured them-
selves for sums that seemed adequate—then! To-day
those sums are quite insufficient. The cost of living has doubled
itself. Amounts that would have kept your dependents years
ago would mean penury to-day. Protect your dependents
to-day as you did years ago. Increase your policy to meet the
new conditions of to-day and to-morrow.

MARKET SECTION
Wheat Restriction
The best of Australian opinion seems
to be against the reported terms of the
provisional wheat agreement which Aus-
tralia, Canada, the U.S.A. and Argentine
are alleged to have adopted. It provides
for reduction of output by 15 per cent,
and adjustment of exports to effective
demand in 1933-34. It is pointed out
that the scheme gives a free hand to
countries like France, which is putting
wheat on the British market at 19s. 6d. per
quarter with the aid of an export bounty,
and Russia, which can range the world
at will in competition with the concerters
of wheat policy, pushing their plans awry.
In most countries outside Europe, how-
ever, the climate has caused appreciable
natural restriction. In Australia a 15
per cent, reduction would have little
effect on export this year, as everybody
realises; but the principle involved in
artificial reduction is bad.
* * * «c
In America the tendency universally
seems to be to peg and bolster wheat
markets. The U.S.A. final estimate of
the harvest is the lowest for 40 years—
-517,000,000 bushels, which is 210,000,000
bushels below the actual harvest of 1932.
The President is playing with the idea of
an export bounty to capture Asiatic
markets with existing surpluses held over
from previous seasons. The scheme is
contingent on the failure of the Wheat
Conference. Winnipeg, on the other
hand, has fixed a minimum price level
on the basis of ruling figures on August
14: October delivery, 2s. ll|d.; Decem-
ber, 3s. o|d.; May, 1934, 3s. 2fd.
Canada, in contrast to the U.S.A., is in
favor of a quota system of supply con-
trol between producer and elevator.
* * * *
In any case the Orient seems to be a
danger area, though some fear the dump-
ing in Britain of Russian and other
foreign wheat competitive with Aus-
tralia’s supplies, at rates which would
nullify our preference of 2s. per quarter.
The manager of the Victorian Wheat-
growers’ Corporation remarks that Aus-
tralia must look upon China and Japan,
which are steadily increasing their con-
sumption of cereals, as her natural wheat
market, and must do everything she
can to develop the trade.
* * * *
Bulk-wheat handling is having a rough
passage in S.A., where a Public Works
Committee is inquiring into the matter.
McAlees, secretary of the Watersiders’
Federation, told the committee that Wal-
laroo would be ruined by bulk handling,
and that about 1500 men would be
thrown on the dole. A farmer, W. U.
Wall, said that he had seen bulk hand-
ling in America, England and elsewhere,
and it was no benefit to the farmer. In
England 5 per cent, of bulk wheat had
to be rebagged to be delivered from the
ship. Another witness said that it would
cost the farmer Id. per bushel in spite
of reduced freights and the cutting out
of bag costs. Where these ideas come
from—apart from those which deal with
reduction of labor —it is difficult to
imagine. England’s.circumstances in re-
spect of handling are far different from
Australia’s. Where the ports feel that
bulk handling is an advantage, as at Hull
and Liverpool, they have bulk handling
up to the limit of their needs, though in
all Britain there certainly is nothing to
match White Bay (N.S.W.). At the same
time, England is the delivery end. She
has not to take care of large surpluses ;
bagging and pests are different problems
with her. In S.A. the matter boils down,
as it does in other States where it is a
problem, to whether security from wee-
vils and mice and the cutting out of bags
and freight-whittling are worth the re-
duction of staff, etc., in a period of
depression. As a matter of efficiency it
should be said that bulk handling has
largely become standard export practice
in Anglo-Saxon countries. In N. S.
Wales silo construction is being pushed
ahead vigorously. Four new plants will
be available this season, and contracts
have been let for more than 30, which
will be functioning in 1934-35.
The Wool Shortage
“Kamilroi”: The Australian wool in-
dustry continues to live up to its eccen-
tric reputation, while the grower still
gropes helplessly in the dark.
The 1932-33 record wool clip was
sold at a level of values which, on the
realisation figures of the 1931-32 clip, is
estimated to show a capital loss on pro-
duction of approximately £7,000,000. Yet
this result was achieved at the moment
when we found ourselves face to face
with one of the greatest shortages of wool
textiles ever recorded. Its approach
was a secret in which the grower was
not invited to share, although it was
apparently well known to the organised
buying side of his business many months
before, if the following translation of a
reputable Continental monthly wool
trade report issued last January is evi-
dence of fact: —
So everywhere emptiness, the clearance of
stocks. So machinery is working faster and
faster, and the. manufacturer buys, is forced to
buy, keeps on buying, and cannot do other-
wise if he is to execute his orders. And the
orders arrive, in large quantities. What is
being bought is for current needs only. What
would it be if, as it is said, the present season
gave; besides the deceiving yields from Aus-
tralia and South Africa, a reduced production
from these two countries?
What would it be if Nature, after being
generous for four years, would decimate the
flocks through drought or other calamities?
There is no need, however, to dream of wars
and strife; no need for sedition among the
sheep to believe in an outstanding wool con-
sumption. For it is there already.
* * * *
If this report, issued by a well-known
woolbroking house of Belgium, reflects
the actual position of the wool industry
as it was eight months ago, when two-
thirds of his record wool clip was still
unsold, the Australian woolgrower has
grounds upon which to establish a charge
of neglect of a national character against
the organisations, political and otherwise,
upon which rests the responsibility of his
protection.
* * * *
There is no get away from the fact
that throughout four successive wool
seasons, whose operations aggregated an
estimated capital loss on production of
£30,000,000, a large section of the Aus-
tralian press, the politicians, from Prime
Minister and Premiers down, and direct
representatives of the wool industry have
repeatedly stated —ad nauseam —that no
relief could be looked for until trade
revived abroad.
* * * *
What the woolgrower, after suffering
incalculable loss, wants to know now is
why the Australian market was permitted
to gradually drop to its lowest recorded
level (March, 1933) three months after
the arrival of a Continental trade activity
described in the foregoing report as “an
outstanding wool consumption” and re-
main on or about that level until a record
clip had been disposed of.
* H= * H=
A world-wide depletion of stocks can-
not happen overnight. It is a coming
event which casts its shadow before.
Statistics should be made to reveal its
approach in the Interests —equally—of
every section of the trade. Sir John Hig-
gins realised this when he said:
The pressing necessity of the wool trader—
particularly in Australia, because Common-
wealth production is the controlling factor in
the. world's wool industry —is the organisation
of a system for the collection of comprehen-
sive, reliable data as to the quantities and
qualities of raw and semi-manufactured
materials available, or prospectively available,
in all wool-producing and wool-using coun-
tries. This would guide woolgrowers when mak-
ing arrangements for the disposal of their clips.
It would be interesting to know what
those who sell our wool have to say
about it all. '
Standardise Our Butter!
It is not only in meat that stand-
ardisation is wanted. Next week butter
factory managers and district officers
of the N.S.W. Agricultural Department
will be awakened by an S.O.S. message
from the Director of Dairying (L. T.
Maclnnes) stressing the need for stan-
dardisation of N.S.W. butter output at
choicest-grade standard. The reason why
Australian butter sells at 82s. a cwt. and
Danish butter at 102 s. a cwt. on the
English market is simply that Danish
butter is uniformly choicest quality ; ours
isn’t —a leaven of poor butter destroys
our chances. In. practically every dis-
trict of N.S.W. there has been a falling
off in quality, in some cases as much as
14 per cent. Taking the State as a whole
the choicest, grade marketed during the
five warmer months of 1930-31 was 92.6
per cent, of the whole output. In 1931-
32 it dropped to 88.7 per cent, and in
1932-33 still further to 86.6 per cent.
* * * *
This year N.S.W. has sent London
20,000 tons of butter, 16,000 tons of
which was superior in quality to Danish
and Maoriland butter, but it did not
realise what might be termed Danish
pastry-quality prices. Why? Because
it was mixed with inferior butter, par-
ticularly from other States. Less than
30 per cent, of Q’land’s 35,000 tons ex-
ported was choicest grade, while only 50
per cent, of the Victorian. export of
38,000 tons was choicest. Other States
beside N.S.W. would do well to send out
the “Save Our Sales” message; It must
be remembered that overseas Australia
is regarded as a whole, and any special
efforts to readjust quality in New South
Wales is nullified by the inactivity of
other States in this respect.
* * * sje
Actually, of the 102,000 tons exported
last year 50 per cent, was of low quality.
Even on the home market the poor
quality of the butter is reflected in the
sales. N.S.W., because of its higher
quality, now unfortunately being dragged
down by other States, has a consump-
tion rate of 33.61 b. per head. The other
States average 231 b. per head, the average
for Australia being 281 b. per head.
Maoriland faced the position some years
ago. Through quality and price it has
increased its annual consumption rate
from 231 b. to 401 b. per head. If the
Australian consumption per head could
be increased from 281 b. to 401 b. the home
market sales would increase by 45,000
tons, i.e., from 70,000 tons to 115,000
tons a year. If manufacturers do not
standardise their outputs at the highest
grade quality marketing, both overseas
and locally, will become increasingly
difficult.
Chilled Beef at Last
The Mooltan shipment of chilled beef
sent home last April marks an epoch and
establishes the carbon-dioxide process.
The days of our having to meet Argen-
tine competition with frozen supplies is
over. The shipment was described as
“equal to Argentine chilled,” and all the
P. and O. ships trading to Australia, as
well as some of the Orient, C. and D.
and Federal boats, are being equipped
with the new facilities. It remains for
Australia to deliver the goods. For the
first time she is on equal terms with the
world in the beef trade, but “quality”
will have to be the watchword if the
opportunity is worth anything. It is no
use the politicians shouting on the
strength of one delivery that we produce
the best beef on earth. There will have
to be a good many thousand stud and
herd bulls bought before that comes
about.
* * * *
If mutton supplies are any good, it
should be an excellent year for exporters.
The London market is better than it was
a twelvemonth ago, and the rise in the
price of wool and skins has had a bright-
ening effect. Some killing-works are
already on the job—Port Lincoln (S.A.),
for instance, will open so soon as suffi-
cient lambs are forward. There the
Government Produce Department fin-
ances the growers to the extent of
75 per cent, of estimated values a
fortnight after killing and adjusts to net
price after actual sale. It also arranges
shipments. The full benefit of new con-
ditions will not, however, be felt until
fat-lamb raising becomes a real business
and until it is organised as a Common-
wealth affair, based on certain fore-
knowledge of quantity and classes of
supplies. Moreover, we have yet a lot
to learn in the delivery of undamaged
carcasses, which sometimes arrive at
Smithfield marred by every kind of
bruise. The secret of success is stand-
ardisation and again standardisation. It
would not be a bad idea for the autho-
rity now in process of constitution to
develop meat export to arrange the
breeding of standard lines ideal for the
British market and seek co-operation
from the railways—aid in having them
(both alive and dead) exhibited and lec-
tured upon in all the chief lamb-breed-
ing centres.
The Citrus Slump
“Gospodin”: Overproduction of citrus
fruits in south-eastern Australia is seri-
ously upsetting the market. Growers
have been hawking mandarins in the
streets of Sydney at 9d. per bucket, which
seems a shocking state of affairs. Surely
there must be uses which enterprise can
make of the mandarin in the way of
crystallised fruit, liqueurs and scents
which could improve matters. And there
should be a vigorous effort to use more
modern processes and the facilities
offered by the British ports to get some
of the trade which Jaffa has built up
for itself in Europe. H. M. Ford, com-
mercial manager of the Clyde Trust, when
he was here in 1929 visited Gosford and
impressed what could be done on local
growers, but apparently the bulk of the
export genius in the orange trade is
centred in the port of Jerusalem. One of
the troubles is that primary producers
are averse to submitting to the most
trifling levies for their own advancement
The tea men of Ceylon and the fruit
men of California have kept themselves
above water on many occasions by co-
operative or concerted marketing plans
financed by levy on output. There are
no finer oranges grown anywhere in the
world than in Australia, and the best
of our lemons are unexcelled, but
we have none of the lemon trade of
Europe, and only a trifle of the orange
trade. The same old story —we won’t
standardise. We won’t grow the right
size and the right type until somebody
takes us by the neck and makes us do it.
And even then we grumble at paying
for our profits.
Super. Comes Down
Australian Fertilizers, Ltd., have an-
nounced a reduction of 7s. 6d. per ton
in the price of both Shirley’s and sul-
phide super. (22 per cent, grade). The
price will now be £4 2s. 6d., which
will be reduced on all fertiliser (other
than for wheat crops) purchased before
the end of November to £3 7s. 6d. by
the Federal subsidy of 15s. per ton.
Super, is now at a record low price in
N. S. Wales.
“Granova”: If you can’t find a decent
“killer” among your, wethers look among
your crossbred ewes. No matter how bad
the drought there will be a few dry
ewes fat enough to make the cook smile
again.


SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Racing at Moorefield on Saturday
threw no light on the Epsom or Metro-
politan. Ranchero, who is in the mile
with 7st. 71b. r caused a surprise (he was
14 to 1) by mowing them down in the
Moorefield Mile after-being last at the
half-mile. He had failed his party badly
at Warwick Farm over 10 furlongs, and
it would appear that he is better at a mile
—be was beaten in the Grafton Cup,
where he appeared to be a racecourse cer-
tainty. Trainer G. Price, who races
Ranchero, also has Kuvera and Shakuni
in the Epsom.
After the Moorefield Mile it was
announced that old Greenline, who was a
starter, had run his last race. Unfor-
tunately his fine performances have been
dimmed by many failures, the inevitable
,result of his being kept at the game too
’long.
Fortune still smiles on pastoralist J. J.
Leahy and trainer M. Webster. The little-
known Comedy (5 to 1) took the first
division of the Kogarah Stakes after prac-
tically leading from barrier-rise. He is
in the Epsom with 7st. 51b. A stable-
mate, Blitzen, who is also in the mile with
7st. 71b., was beaten by the Warwick
Farm-trained Segovia (4 to 1) in the
second division. Blitzen was slow to find
his legs, and kept lugging out most of
the way. Segovia is by Magpie, and being
BertC'lm very hot at pinq-pon^.

a five-year-old has been given plenty of

in the Epsom.
' * .
Randwick trainer J. Abbs ran Intombi
and Parmint in the third division of the
Kogarah .Stakes. His choice was In-
tombi, who was fairly well backed
at tens, while Parmint was allowed to
go out at 20 to 1. Parmint won in good
style; Intombi, after showing pace, could
only run fifth. The even-money favorite
Bombastic appeared to be troubled by the
turns..
Tr * . ' ' ,
Veterinary surgeon V E. H. Davis and
Earner *7 lt c^e , were d ,s^PP°'nl. e 1
Measure s run at Warwick Farm. Simp-
son who rides the colt in most of his
work, was given the mount in
year-old at Moorefield, and so kindly did
Measure go for him that the son of Mag-
p,e who is a Derby c and.date won easily,
at 9 , Vb T K e tav ’
mate of Ranchero, gave an mglonous d s-
ptay. He was u.i er P, . ,
mile and merely plugged along in the
stratght. He is a long stnder, and evi-
dently needs plenty of room. t
Frank and Claude Moore, owners of
Wicklow, who won many races with
Caved well er, were sanguine that their
gelding would be hard to defeat in the
Moorefield Handicap. The result was
that the paddock bookmakers always kept
him inside double figures (sevens at the
finish), though in the Leger as much as
15 to 1 was laid Wicklow made his run
at the turn, where Cavedweller stole many
events at the Kogarah track, and lasted
long enough to beat Ramrod and Confab.
Wicklow has now won three races at
Moorefield, where he is trained.
* * * *
Topical’s success in the Flying Handi-
cap at Rosebery, and Rogilla.’s dead-heat
with Loch Garry in a race with the same
name at Newcastle, demonstrated—if any
demonstration were needed- that these
horses will have to be considered in the
big events of the spring. It is quite on
the cards that Topical will develop into a
weight-for-age horse. Second to him was
Dermid ; Limarch and Ammon Ra were
third and fourth. All three were backed,
but the Windbag gelding went out at 33
to 1.

Jumping accidents have been numer-
ous on Melbourne courses this winter.
Several good horses were either killed
outright or had to be destroyed. That
occurs season after season, but the toll
of human injury has been unusually
heavy. Stubbs, the Tasmanian jockey,
died as the result of a fall at Caulfield on
August 12. In the following week Shel-
don received spinal injuries when West-
lock came a cropper in.the Brush Steeple
at Epsom. At Flemington on Saturday
Jnkson, the premier cross-country jockey,
joined the unlucky band. He weighed
out for Redditch in the August Steeple.
Even with 13st. 81b. the Grand National
hero seemed unbeatable, and he started
at 9 to 4on in a field of four. He made
more than one faulty jump before turn-
ing a somersault at the second of the
abattoirs treble. The horse regained his
legs and galloped away unhurt, but Ink-
son lay motionless. “Concussion,” the
doctors said, and at time of writing the
jockey had not regained consciousness.
......
Hall Mark justified his position as
Derby favorite by a splendid perform-
ance j n the first division of the Three-
year-old Handicap. The Heroic colt had
no t raced for four months, but, though
handicapped at 9st. 101 b., he shared
f a voritism with Brutus. Latter is trained
by Lou Robertson for A. G. Hunter (who
bought him privately as a yearling) and
J. Fell. Heather, the rider of Hall Mark,
daimed ?]b apprentice a n oW ance. Hail
Mark even then was conceding Brutus
near ] y 2st. Brutus scored by a head after
an intensely exciting finish. He lost a
little ground at the start, and, when mak-
. j near the six-furlong post,
so y badly that his
nose almost
h d the grou ’ d . xhat appeared t 0
have settled the chance of Brutus, but
as soon as (he straight was entered he
came through the field at whirlwind speed
d joined fc issue with Hal , Ma rk a fur-
, ’ f| . om home . The manner in which
Hall Mark fought on with his heavy
burden was highly commendable ; yet the
honors lay with Brutus, who gave his
illustrious rival a long start from the turn
into the straight.
‘ ’ c
. Owners of Brutus gave him plenty of
time to matuie. He did not race until
January. After tour unplaced outings the
Windbag colt created a surprise by run-
ning second m the Two-year-old Mile
at the V.R.C. Grand National meeting,
His dam, Scarlet, won the Sydney Cup
of 1924 for J. I. Winter-Irving, of the
V.R.C. committee, who bred Brutus.
Weighted at 7st. 21b. in the Caulfield Cup
and 6st. 121 b. in the Melbourne Cup, this
colt will have to be reckoned with. Hall
Mark, though not massive, has furnished
into a very handsome thoroughbred,
* ' . ‘ ‘
Second division of the Three-year-old
Handicap went to Excelic, a gelded son
of Heroic. He may have been lucky to
defeat Dick Devon, the favorite, who
came on the scene too late. Dick Devon
cost only 30gns. as a yearling, and was
not considered worthy of being entered
for the Cups. Devonshire, the sire of
Dick Devon, was represented in the
Apprentices’ Handicap by Ogwell, who
never gave the opposition a look-in, and
registered his fourth successive victory.
Casque d’Or, trained in Sydney, was
favorite, but gave a poor display. The
spring mission of Ogwell is the Mel-
bourne Cup, in which he has 6st. 91b.
Eric Connolly, who won with the Night
Raid colt Wheriko on Australian Steeple-
chase day, was again in the limelight on
Saturday, when he took the August Han-
dicap with Dark Man. The Ethiopian
gelding has been difficult to train, and
Connolly did not enter him for the Cups.
Made the medium of a big betting coup,
he scored stylishly from Purveyor and
Mural Crown. Good form has been
struck by the Spearhead stallion Prince
Leo, but the field he defeated in the first
division of the Highweight Handicap was
merely moderate.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Encouraged with cries of “Go on, Aus-
tralia!” Muir bothered Lurich in their
wrestle at Leichhardt on Saturday night,
and the Russian was often bowled over,
though not for an official fall. In the
fifth Muir tossed his man over the ropes.
Unfortunately for the Victorian, Lurich’s
arms were wound round his nefck, and,
himself dragged over, Muir shot head
first to the floor. He lay prone, blood
pouring from a gashed eyebrow, and
could not continue. Lurich, who had
crawled back to mid-ring, was declared
the winner.
FootbrawJ
After his fortnight’s rest the barracker
turned up to Melbourne’s League games
in full force and rare fettle, some 25,000
roaring approval at Fitzroy as the
Maroons avenged their first-round lick-
ing by Geelong. The Hubbites notoriously
play an uncertain game away from home
and on Saturday their forwards were
lamentable, fooling away chances and
wasting themselves in hopeless efforts.
Also they missed captain Reg Hickey,
who retired early with a broken collar-
bone. So ’Roy stepped up to third place
by scoring 98 points to 86. Another 25,000
made a big noise at the Carlton Oval
while Collingwood, playing like cham-
pions now that it is too late, out-
manoeuvred the Blues and won by 101
points to 92, Regan outmarking Vallence
and proving himself ’Wood’s long-wanted
full-back. South Melbourne kept its place
by waltzing over Essendon to the tune
of 82 to 40 ; and Footseray did ditto by
piling up 124 to Melb.’s 94. Hawthorn,
as usual, kept well ahead of Richmond,
up to half-time, then faded away to lose
with 60 points to the Tigers’ 83. North
Melbourne beat St. Kilda by 107 to 72.
So welt matched are the leading teams
that, with two rounds to play, any of six
may get into the final four ; even Rich-
mond, on the top rung, may yet be
ousted, though that is hardly likely.
* * * *
The Wallabies won the nineteenth
match of their tour against Eastern Pro-
vince on Saturday by 18-3, or four tries,
one converted, and a dropped goal by
Malcolm to a try. The game was at Port
Elizabeth, the scene of the fourth Test
this week-end. Changes were made in the
Australian back division during the game
with a view to the Test. Malcolm has
regained his form, but Ross still felt the
result of his operation, being much slower
than of yore.
* * * *
The last round of the Rugby Union
grade competitions in Sydney saw North-
ern Suburbs upset Manly’s pot for the
minor premiership, the Villagers suffer-
ing defeat on their own ground by 11-21.
The Northern forwards played a magni-
ficent game and swept the opposition off
its feet. The winners scored five tries,
three of which were converted by
Mitchell. Manly crossed twice, Sheldon
converting one try and adding a penalty.
As a result of this, Manly and Western
Suburbs must play off for the minor
premiership, while University and North-
ern Suburbs will have to play an extra
game to decide the team to take fourth
place in the semi-finals. University’s re-
serve grade side —the first was engaged
in the inter-State Universities tourney—
went down to Western Suburbs by 3-19.
W.S. scored three tries, Barnes, as usual,
converting them and kicking three penalty
goals. Drummoyne, on its own ground,
beat Randwick 24-16 in a match full of
injuries. Eastern Suburbs went to Hurst-
ville and there scored its first win of the
season by downing St. George 8-0.
* * * *
The inter-Universities matches during
the week saw Sydney definitely ahead,
though the home team was fortunate to
beat Queensland on Saturday by 19-17,
a snap try in the last minute doing the
trick. Melbourne and Adelaide, the
latter making its first appearance in the
series, aroused much interest with their
match. The Victorians knew too much,
winning 28-6. The Adelaideans are
naturally rough in their first season, but
the material is good. In Porter and
O'Connor they have two likely three-
quarters, and Edmonds and Lyons are
excellent forwards. The team’s fault
generally is high tackling, only natural
since most of them are ex-Australian
Rules players.
The big game of the week, Combined
Universities v. Metropolis—practically a
N.S.W. side—saw Metropolitan win
20-13. For the first time, players from
Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria and South
Australia figured in the combined side.

In the Rugby League grade matches,
Newtown won the minor premiership by
beating North Sydney 9-4, a try and three
goals to two goals. The club has now the
right to challenge if beaten in the semi-
finals or final. Newtown has 18 points
to 17 held by Eastern Suburbs and South
Sydney. With St. George, the four meet
in the semi-finals. Of the other matches,
South Sydney managed to beat Balmain
16-13, Christensen scoring all Balmain's
points with a try, which he converted,
and four penalty goals. St. George won
from Western Suburbs, 31-10, at Pratten
Park, and Eastern Suburbs easily disposed
of University at Marrickville by 29-8.

The Kangaroos are now at their train-
ing quarters at Ilkley in Yorkshire after
a royal welcome from the Northerners.
Their Northern Union rivals are already
hard at their competitions, and the tour-
ists had a new experience in seeing a
game started at 6.30 p.m. and played out
in the twilight, between Bradford and
Keighley.

“Outside Right”: The Australian
Soccer football side which recently in-
vaded Noumea got the shock of its young
life in the first Test with the New Cale-
donians, winning by a mere two goals to
one. A public holiday was declared and
the local potentates attended in full re-
galia with a third of the population. The
Australians were welcomed by a band
which played the National Anthem, “The
Marseillaise” and “Advance, Australia
Fair”' straight off the reel, a happening
which probably unnerved them.

Two Australian road cycling cham-
pionships changed hands at the week-end
in Queensland. In the 100 kilometres,
J. Buckley, of N.S.W., defeated the title-
holder, E. Milliken, of Victoria, in 2hr.
46min. ssec., a new record. The junior
championship of 25 miles went to E.
Berg, of N.S.W., who beat his fellow-
Cornstalk, S. Brazier, in Ihr. smin. 41sec.

PERPETUAL TRUSTEE COMPANY (LIMITED)
The Chairman (Mr. T. H. Kelly’s) Address to Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
held at the Offices of the Company on the 1 7th August, 1933.
Notwithstanding the fact that the New Business entrusted to us
during the year was very satisfactory, resulting in a net increase in our
figures of no less than £1,546,331, our net profits are somewhat lower than
those for last year, but, nevertheless, we feel justified in recommending
the payment of a Final Dividend of 4%, which, with the Interim Dividend
of 3% paid in January last, represents a return to our Shareholders of 7%
for the year. In addition, we have been able to apply £l5OO to the Invest-
ment Fluctuation Account and £lOOO to the Officers’ Provident Fund,
leaving £3252/13/1 to be carried forward.
Our Reserve Fund remains at £120,000, but, although our mortgage
investments showed a large margin of security at the time the moneys
were advanced, there has been such a heavy decline in the value of real
estate that we have decided to add another £l5OO to the fund, held as a
reserve against depreciation of our assets. I should, however, state that by
making this extra provision I do not wish to imply that there will be any
material loss, on these investments, but we prefer to act on the side of
safety.
I feel that no explanation is really necessary in regard to the slight
reduction in our net profits. It should, however, be noted that our figures
have been prejudicially affected for the whole of this year by the Reduction
of Interest and Rents Acts. This legislation only affected our income for a
portion of last year. Also, during the first half of this year, there was not
the improvement in the revenue of our Trust Estates that we would have
desired, so that from this source there was no material addition to our
income commission.
During the past six months there has, however, been some improve-
ment, and I speak with a certain amount of confidence, when reviewing
the present outlook generally, in predicting that the worst of our troubles
are really over. There is a more hopeful feeling in evidence regarding the
future than has been apparent for some considerable time. In support of
this statement I might say that during the past six months we have
succeeded in securing tenants for a number of premises belonging to our
Estates which had been vacant for a considerable period; our rent collec-
tions are improving, and the number of Mortgagors who cannot meet
their obligations is steadily becoming smaller. These are experiences of a
personal nature, but, in addition, the recent increases in the values of wool,
metals and other products are obviously creating a more hopeful spirit in
the community. I quite' realise that the destinies of this country are, to a
great extent, dependent on conditions ruling in other parts of the world,
and that a considerable period must elapse before we can return to pre-
depression conditions, if, in fact, in our lifetime we shall ever do so,
but, with sound government and no serious droughts to contend with, we
should be able to face the future with renewed optimism.
Speaking of sound government, our Parliaments can, and should, assist
the efforts of private enterprise to bring about a return of prosperity.
Economic and commercial authorities of high standing agree that further
reduction in the cost of government is not only desirable, but possible, and
that a reduction in taxation has become imperative. I can quite appreciate
the enormous difficulties that Australian Parliaments have had to contend
with during recent years. Excellent work has been done no doubt, but much
more remains to be done. We should, as a community, work steadily towards
a less extravagant system of public administration by the elimination of
unnecessary public activities and the co-ordination of those activities which
are really necessary.
As a field for the exercise of judicious economy I would refer to the
collection of duties on the estates of deceased persons by both the Federal
and the State Governments. These duties are assessed and paid on the same
assets; why, therefore, should there not be one collecting authority? It seems
to me that the various State Treasurers should be able to collect these duties
and hand cheques to the Federal Government for its share at the end, say,
of each month. We are told that this cannot, for technical legal reasons,
be done, but I am satisfied, gentlemen, that with co-ordination of legislation
(which could be simply effected), it could be accomplished without difficulty
and be the means of saving thousands of pounds per annum.
As far as taxation is concerned, whilst aware of the fact that there
have lately been some remissions, especially by the Federal Government,
I am sure I am on safe grounds when I say that, taking all the taxes we
have to pay into consideration, the burden has become almost unbearable,
and that far too large a proportion of Australia’s Income is absorbed in
this manner. Over 28 per cent, of this Company’s own net income is applied
in payment of Income and Family Endowment Taxes, apart altogether from
the exceedingly heavy impost we have to face in the shape of Municipal,
Water and Land Taxes, etc. The Beneficiaries of our Trust Estates have, of
course, suffered in more or less similar manner. Some of this money would,
I am sure you will agree with me, be more profitably utilised in other
directions for the benefit of the community.
There is another subject on which I would like to make a few remarks,
and that is the question of investments on mortgage. When our State
Legislature passed the Moratorium Act, I am sure that they had in mind
(and quite rightly so) the amelioration of the position of numerous mort-
gagors who, through no fault of their own, were unable —perhaps only
temporarily— to meet their obligations. They could not, however, have
anticipated that the result of that Act would be that many mortgagors
would seize upon it as a heaven-sent opportunity to dishonor their obliga-
tions and that mortgagees would be branded as people without principle or
sympathy. I have never heard of a mortgagee forcing a loan on a mort-
gagor ; the advance is invariably made on an application for financial
assistance by the borrower. That being so, surely the mortgagee is not
exceeding his right in asking for payment of his interest, especially in
cases in which he is a Trustee and the interest is payable to a beneficiary—
perhaps some person who is in greater need than the mortgagor himself.
I speak with some feeling because of our knowledge of several cases in
which mortgagors have collected rents from the security greatly in excess
of the interest due and still refuse to pay it. Then, again, we are told that
a mortgagee should share with his mortgagor any loss on the realisation of
the security. I must admit I cannot follow this argument. If I had bought
a property some years ago and find I can now only realise at a loss,
what sort of a reception might I expect from the vendor if I asked him
to share the loss with me? Again, people who, before the depression, had
purchased shares or other assets —such as debentures —on the Stock Ex-
change would, I am certain, receive a merited rebuff if they now asked
the seller of those investments to share with them any subsequent loss.
Why, then, should an unfortunate mortgagee be selected for arguments of
this nature?
Mortgages are essentially a trustee form of investment, and trustees
invest money in mortgages largely on behalf of widows, orphans, invalids,
aged and infirm persons, and also on behalf of provident funds from which
retired employees derive their pensions. The life insurance companies are
also large holders of mortgage investments. On the other hand, mortgagors
are very often business men or companies in a large way of business who
find it convenient for reasons of finance to mortgage their property.
It is quite a mistake to imagine that mortgagees as a class are any
less deserving of consideration than mortgagors. There are many genuine
cases of hardship amongst mortgagees and, on the other hand, there are
cases of dishonest mortgagors taking unfair advantage of legislation in order
to evade obligations that they are capable of fulfilling.
There are many mortgagees on whom this legislation has pressed
unduly, most of them fairminded persons who require no compulsory
legislation to compel them to deal leniently with their mortgagors. It is
very unjust that these people should have been victims of sweeping
legislation and popular misconception deserved only by that type of
mortgagee who refuses to listen to any appeal for consideration.
No sensible mortgagee will unduly harass a decent mortgagor who is
doing his best to meet his obligations, just as no decent mortgagor will
seek to evade those obligations and damage his own reputation.
In business reasonable consideration, like honesty, is good policy.
These remarks about the unfair effect of legislation regarding mortgages
are also applicable to the legislation affecting landlords and tenants.
It is interesting to notice that in the columns of the press, social workers,
clergymen and others have been recently acknowledging the long-ignored
fact that very often landlords are in more pitiful financial difficulties than
their tenants. I hope that recognition of this truth will in future lead to a
more just attitude towards owners of house property.
It is impossible to provide for all hard cases and dishonorable behavior,
and I submit that much harm is done in the community when legislation
fails to consider a matter in its broadest aspect. Our legislators and also
the public should constantly bear in mind the wise proverb that “Hard
cases make bad law.” The one paramount consideration in legislation
should be not its effect on individual cases, but its effect on the general
welfare of the community.
It is desirable that money should flow freely in the community for the
benefit of its innumerable activities, and this free use of money will be
hampered unless the rights of.both lender and borrower, as well as land-
lord and tenant, receive proper consideration.
It is apt to be forgotten that, if a community is to progress, new capital
must be continually provided for new enterprise. This new capital is saved
in relatively small amounts by very large numbers of thrifty people in all
walks of life and it passes into use through the agency of the financial
institutions, who are responsible to the real owners for investing the money
prudently.
Anything which discourages the saving of new capital and which renders
its investment unsafe or unprofitable is detrimental to the whole community.
One always finds stagnation and poverty in countries whose Governments
have failed to protect and encourage thrift and enterprise. On the other
hand, the highest standards of living and the greatest general well-being are
to be found in those communities where capital accumulates and finds
profitable investment.
You will have observed from our report that the notifications of the
appointment of the Company as executor under wills were substantially
greater than those recorded during a similar period for the past three or
four years. This is, of course, very satisfactory, and I hope you will pardon
me if I again draw attention to the necessity for testators generally to
review the provisions of their wills unless they are of recent date. Owing
to the fall in value of practically all investments, a will made four or five
years ago might to-day prove to be entirely unworkable and probably unjust
if in it provision were made for payment of legacies or other gifts in priority
to dispositions in favor of the family of the testator. I have no hesitation,
therefore, in once more urging those who have not done so to consult their
solicitors without delay and arrange for a review of their testamentary
dispositions.
These years of depression have been particularly trying ones for our
staff. Clients naturally are anxious to know why the returns from nearly
all classes of investment have diminished, and also the reasons for con-
siderable reduction in income caused by the Moratorium Act and by legisla-
tion affecting interest, mortgages and house property—as well as by new
taxation. Much time has been taken up answering inquiries of this nature,
especially from clients overseas, who have suffered further reduction in
income from the adverse exchanges, and, of course, much time has been
absorbed in ascertaining our position and duties as a trustee under this
new legislation. Our staff have handled the situation with energy, patience
and tact.
We look to them not only .to carry out the detailed duties of their office
work, but also to uphold the honorable traditions which should at all times
be associated with a trustee company such as ours. I am glad to say that
they continue to prove themselves worthy of our confidence in these as in
other respects.

“Gate”: The heavy loss over the Aus-
tralian football “carnival” has caused the
National Football Council to revise the
proposed allowances to teams and pay
against actual expenditure, £1468 being
allotted for claims amounting to £2762.
Only N.S.W., Canberra and Queensland
will be paid in full, Westralia, South
Australia, Victoria and Tasmania re-
ceiving only Bs. 6d. in the £ on their
outlay. It is hoped to get the money
back by a three-sided contest between
Westralia, Victoria and South Australia
at Perth next year.

“Rover”: Even the most ardent sup-
porters of the Australian football code
will realise, after the loss of over £lOOO
on the inter-State matches in Syd-
ney, that it is hopeless to attempt
to establish the game as a rival to the
Rugby Union and the Rugby League
codes in Sydney or Brisbane. It is not
that the game is not an attractive one
in all respects. Its greatest handicap is
that it is confined to Australia and can
never hope to find favor out of it. To
the aspiring young player in the Rugby
States the prospect of a free trip abroad
to see new lands is an irresistible incen-
tive to join the codes that give oppor-
tunities of doing so. This year alone
the Rugby Union and the
League have teams touring
South Africa and England,
while a combined Universi-
ties Rugby Union side is
packing up for a trip to
Japan. Soccer lads also go
abroad and entertain over-
seas visitors. All the Aus-
tralian player can look for-
ward to, apart from club
games, are desultory inter-
state meetings.
* * *
“Stand Off”: The Sydney
G.P.S. competition, which
generally furnishes the most
attractive exhibitions of
Rugby Union in N.S.W..
closed this season with
Church of England Gram-
mar School and St. Joseph's
tied in the first place. There
is a foolish rule which pro-
vides that in such an event
each school enjoys premie-
ship honors for six months
instead of playing off. As
a result this season we saw
two matches of “Premiers
v. The Rest” instead of one.
C. of E. was defeated ; St.
Joseph’s won. Joeys have
a wonderful record: pre-
miers for four years and never once
beaten in a match.
* * * *
“Slim Kerel”: The Wallabies defeated
the South-West Province at Oudtshoorn,
of ostrich-farming fame, by 21-14, scor-
ing five tries, three converted, to a try and
three penalty goals. Chief interest to
Australians was the reappearance of Mal-
colm and Ross. If they can figure in
remaining Tests our prospects arc good.
Not only will the team’s two best key
men be back in their positions, but Ross
will relieve the sparkling Steggall from
full-back to take up his proper place at
five-eighth, a possie which has been a
weak link in the side.

The Rugby League Kangaroos have
landed safely in London and have re-
ceived a welcome hitherto not accorded
there to players in the North of England
code. The organisers of the reception,
headed by Sir Noel Curtis-Bennett, were
mostly people interested in Wembley
Stadium, where it is proposed to stage
a propaganda match between the visi-
tors and “Wales” at the end of the season,
as well as another against a team to be
brought up from Lancashire on Novem-
ber 22. The side opens its North of
England programme of 33 matches
against St. Helen's Recreation Club on
August 26.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Fore”: A deputation of immense im-
portance to golfers waited on the N. S.
Wales Minister for Justice the other day
to ask for an amendment of the licensing
law to permit clubs, formed since the Act
of 1905 debarred the issue of new licenses
to such bodies, to sell liquor to mem-
bers. There can be no doubt about the
justice of the request, and under proper
safeguards the change will probably be
made.
“Shore”: At Killara’s annual war-
service dinner a christening cup is pre-
sented to all ex-Diggers who have become
the fathers of sons during the year —
there seems to be no provision for re-
warding associate members in these cases
—-and for some years there have been
anything up to half a dozen lecipients.
This year there was only one solitary
applicant.

“Sandringham”: Victoria’s amateur
golf championship opens at the Metro-
politan club’s course on Sept. 26. The
event is open to amateurs with handicaps
not exceeding 6 strokes, and begins on
September 30 with two qualifying rounds
BARRACKER: " Don’t drop it, Jacky.”
JACKY: “No fear! Possess'n nine poims: three plurry tries."
of 18 holes stroke. The leading 16 play
off 36 holes match play on the knock-
out system on October 2, 3. 4 and 5.
The men’s foursomes, 36 holes stroke,
comes off on October 6. Mick Ryan,
holder of the Australian open title, is
the State singles champion,
“Ornis”: Crows aren't the only birds
to harass worried golfers. Several of
the Sydney clubs have lately been suffer-
ing from visitations of various types of
fowl. At Concord the associates and
their friends have had to shift their tea-
drinking activities to the lounge, the
usual room having been invaded by a
coarse and obstreperous sparrow which
bites pieces out of the cakes. At the
Australian club there has been a lot of
trouble with a minah. He butted into
the lounge-room and gave members a
hot time getting him out after he had
sampled the contents of a whisky and
soda.
* * * sis
“Lakeside”: Gene Sarazen won the
professional championship of America
for the third time at Milwaukee, where
the beer again comes from, last week.
Last year he won the British and Ameri-
can open championships, but went down
in the Yankee professional meeting to
the giant Dutra, who this time early van-
ished from the picture. W. Goggin, a
Californian golfer, was the runner-up,
Sarazen winning 5 and 4, his first suc-
cess in the event being as long ago as
1922.
Car and Cycle
"Whizz”: Malcolm Campbell and the
folk behind the Lake George (N.S.W.)
speedway project continue to keep up an
animated correspondence. Campbell still
seems dubious as to the hardness of the
going : he mentions that his car weighs
close to five tons, and that the track
should be hard enough to lake no
impression from this. He advises the
Georgians to make a temporary speedway
and try it. The lake's occasional ten-
dency to fill up with water is also a
drawback, but the enthusiasts are deter-
mined that in that case they will switch
the offer over to Kaye Don and his new
speedboat.
* * * *
“Formula”: R. A. Railton, designer of
Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird and
Cobb’s Silver Streak, has a new car on
the way which will eclipse both. It will
be shorter than the Blue Bird, and
will have the smallest body of all the
record-breakers yet seen. To obviate
the loss of power by side-slip the new
car will have a drive on all four wheels,
and the designer guarantees an average
speed of 300 m.p.h. for his 2000 h.p. job.
which is to cost about £15,000.
“Kick Starter”: Dirt-track motor-cycle
racing is catching on in the United States,
and California alone expects to have 10
tracks in action before long. Frank
Arthur, who returned from the States
recently with a team he took over there,
found the sport drawing good crowds.
The team had no trouble in getting en-
gagements and the money was quite good.
Racquet and Bawl
“Milton”: Queensland has been hold-
ing a special tennis tourney in connec-
tion with the annual Show in Brisbane.
Hopman beat Moon, who has been back
to his best form, in the final of the
singles. The star turn, however, was Mrs.
Molesworth, for years one of Australia’s
best women players. She followed up her
victory over Australian champion Joan
Hartigan in the inter-State match with
N.S.W. by again defeating her in the
singles semi-finals and then outing fellow-
Queenslander Mrs. Westacott in the
finals. With Mrs. Westacott, she also
won the women’s doubles from Misses
Hartigan and Hall.
* * * ' *
‘‘Rev. Knucklebone”: The A.L.T.A.’s
annual report shows that it is far from
being on a bad wicket, though owing to
the ‘‘heavy personal expenses” of the
American visitors £493 was lost on the
tour. The cash allowances made the
Yankees and their wives were commented
on at the time, and if the A.L.T.A. had
been a public company shareholders
would have been vociferous on the sub-
ject. These came to £2904, together with
travelling expenses, for the men, and
£1460 for their wives. All the same the
Association has close on £6OOO socked
away in investments and the Davis Cup
account, with a certain profit in sight
from the European-American tour of the
Davis Cup team.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: The Australian tennis
heads are again at odds with the State
organisations. In the past the practice
in Australian championship tourneys
has been that one-third of the net
takings went to the Australian body, a
third to the State holding the champion-
ship, and a third to the remaining
States. Now the Federal body proposes
that it take all the profits, allowing the
State in which the tourney is held 15
per cent. A yell has gone up from
N.S.W., South Australia and Victoria,
the three States which hold champion-
ship meetings. Queensland, Tassie and
Westralia, which have to date not been
allowed a bite of the apple, are enjoy-
ing the wrangle.
* * ❖ *
“Whitewash”: What looks like a
world’s record in tennis went up recently
in Sydney when the Cambridge club met
the Kit Cat in the Sydenham-Bankstown
area competition. Cambridge won with-
out losing a point, there being four sets
of doubles and four of singles.
Miscellaneous
The West Indies flopped again in the
third and final Test with England at the
Oval. They had lost the first and drawn
the second. They got England out for
312, but could only manage 100 and 195
in reply, Marriott, a Cambridge and Kent
amateur, taking 11 for 96 in the match.
The team for India under Jardine looks
like being a frost, eight of those origin-
ally chosen having decided not to go.
Most of the abstainers, including Wyatt,
Sutcliffe and Ames, were with Jardine in
Australia.
* * * *
“Blade”: S. A. Middleton, who re-
turned to his native Australia last week
after 19 years’ absence in England, was
one of the finest oarsmen and Rugby
forwards this country has seen. After
the Armistice he left the A.I.F. to take
up a London billet, and during his years
in England he was this country’s rowing
representative. He rowed for N.S.W. in
1910-11 and in the Australian crew which
won the Grand Challenge Cup at Hen-
ley in 1912. In football he was a mem-
ber of the first Wallabies team in Britain
in 1908-09.

“Amateur Pro.”: Bobby Pearce makes
his first appearance as a professional
sculler on September 1, when he rows
Ted Phelps, the world’s champion, in a
special race on Lake Ontario at Toronto.
The course will have a turn, and Pearce
is accustoming himself to the conditions.
The race is not for the championship,
but one is sure to follow should he win.
If Pearce has kept his form he should do
this, for, rowing with Phelps in his Olym-
pic training at Amsterdam, he was always
too good for the Thames sculler.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
By the Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon.
Bonnie Doon had its beginnings in
1901, when a party of friends founded
it as the Marrickville G.C. Among the
originals were E. W. Boake, Dr. Pat
McArthur, Trevor Jones—now of the
Australian —J. E. Stokes, F. W. Barker,
C. A. Richardson, and the late Frederick
Gannon, solicitor, with his sons, one of
whom, Leslie Gannon, is vice-president
to-day.
There were then no subscriptions and
no green fees, the land played over
belonging to Frederick Gannon, who
gave free use of it. It was an 18-hole
course at Tempe, and the bunkers were
post-and-rail fences—a real steeplechase
course. Meetings were at first held at
the home of A. T. Jones in Way-street,
members doing their own catering.
As time went on an hon. sec. and a
caretaker were appointed, and the first
subscription reared its head in this Eden
—£l Is. for members and 10s. 6d. for
associates. Then with the help of a
surveyor member, C. E. Caswell, the pre-
sent area was taken over, and the club
was renamed at the instance of the late
Dr. Gordon Craig.
At Arncliffe there is a modern course
of 6165 yards. On this in 1928 the
present clubhouse was erected at a cost
of £16,000. The course, laid out by Dr.
Alastair Mackenzie, is on the flat side,
with excellent greens but a tricky fair-
way. It breeds a solid type of golfer,
as may be seen from the fact that the
club won the A-grade premiership last
year. There are about 250 members,
100 associates and 20 non-playing mem-
bers.
The club has a notable string of tro-
phies nowadays. These include the Shen-
stone Cup, in memory of an ex-captain ;
the Drummoyne Cup, presented by E. W.
Goodwin to mark the amalgamation with
Bonnie Doon of the old Drummoyne
Club; the Bonnie Doon Shield ; the
Saywell Shield ; the C. M. Harris Shield,
in memory of the donor’s son, also a
member, who fell in the war, and the
Wayland Shield. Among notable players
who have figured with Bonnie Doon are
Tommy Howard and D. G. Soutar. The
present captain is Frank McMullen, head
of Sydney Technical High School, and
known in Sydney cricket in an earlier
day.
Leading the vision of manly beauty
spread before us is P. Meyer, who is
interested in the motor industry. As be-
hoves his comfortable contours, he is
of a merry temperament and never
upset by the fluctuations which are not
infrequent in his golf; nevertheless, he is
a very useful player. R. T. Kelly, who
follows on, is a printer, and used to play
cricket with Waverley before golf swal-
lowed him, hook, line and sinker. He
plays a steady game from the 12-mark.
E. M. Kelly, who is, of course, invari-
ably accosted as “Ned,” is a son of R.T.,
and an ex-A.I.F. man. He plays off 13,
but is a bit erratic. Frith has drawn
him leaping in the air, so he has pro-
bably just missed a six-inch putt. H.
Boardman is head of the Sydney lino-
type service which bears his name. He
is a member of the committee, and is a
sound player on the 11-mark and the
stylist of the club. He is secretary of
its A.I.F. association.
No. 5 is Fred Gawler, who is con-
nected with Union Theatres. He is apt
to carry a spirit of levity into his
game, but when he likes can turn on an
uncommonly good brand of golf. He
won the Vicars Cup last year.
C. G. Orreill is in the Telephone De-
partment. He is an A-grade player and
a keen one, though he likes to assume a
dilettante air with it all. He is an en-
thusiastic committeeman, but it is as the
club’s glass of fashion and mould of
sartorial form that he stands out.
George Thompson, who is seventh on
the film, enjoys an equable temperament
that nothing can shatter. He is with T.
Playfair and Co., and is one of the best
of the State’s veteran golfers, with a
special weakness for foursomes. He and
Jim Ferrier won the N.S.W. champion-
ship this year. He is club champion.
W. G. Brown is the No. 8. He is a
chartered accountant and an A.I.F. man,
wounded on Gallipoli. W.G. is trea-
surer, an A-grade player and a strong
fancy for the club championship this
year.
A. N. Brown, who is anchored on
No. 9, is editor of “Golf in Australia.”
Frith has caught him wondering how he,
an ex-Light Horseman, came to duff that
last approach and trying to remember
what they used to say in Sinai on such
occasions.
Richard Harris is a new member, but
an enthusiastic one. He is an estate
agent, imbued with the idea that the
game is an easy one, an opinion that he
will alter with time and experience.
At No. 11 is Frank McMullen,
the industrious captain. He carries the
schoolmaster’s forthrightness into his
game, his place being among the middle
handicaps. Knight William Vicars is pre-
sident, and one of the oldest members,
His name is a household word in Aus-
tralian industry if not in Australian golf
—as a player, let it be added, for he has
done much for Bonnie Doon and other
clubs. W. Yates has drawn No. 13
marble. The artist has limned him faith-
fully, though he has failed to note the
alleged fact that his subject is always
in a hurry.
H. Cooper is No. 14. His bright
smile haunts the clubhouse during his
absences in Queensland, where he has
business interests. He plays a pretty good
game.
O. W. Beck, who is next on the line,
is a printer, and an associate in the busi-
ness of George Patterson, whom w©
shall meet presently. Beck is another
Digger, but business keeps him from im-
proving his golf. He plays a good deal
for the fun of it, but is chary of handing
in a card.
L. S. Watts is a son of Spencer Watts,
president of the Sydney Chamber of
Commerce. His trouble in life—or,
rather, in golf, which is much the same
a flat swing,
On No. 17 behold T. C. (“Tom”)
Seage, who is a retired railwayman. He
is a week-day player, and is here evi-
dently recalling how many strokes he
took in that last bunker.
Colonel E. M. Logan is No. 18. He
was a member of the Australian Staff
Corps, and commanded a battalion on
the other side, having fought in Africa
before that and done a term with the
regulars in India as a special service
officer. He was for some years secre-
tary of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squad-
ron. As a golfer he is unrivalled in the
theory of the game.
G. H. Adams is a chemist in the City
Council’s electrical branch. He is a con-
scientious handicapper, and can be seen
here piping off someone or other to see
it he isn’t running a bye. A good player
himself, he is a well-liked personality.
No. 20, George Patterson, gives pro-
mise of becoming a good golfer, but
often pays less attention to “birdies” and
“eagles” than to his aviary. He is an
efficient committeeman and a Digger,
A. H. Hallett, on 21, is a dentist, tall
and willowy and well coiffured, as his
likeness shows. He can play a good
game off the 12-mark when in the mood.
J. H. Peters, last in the procession, is
a builder with a bent for invention. He
is an optimist as regards golf, but admits
that he plays it as much for healthful
exercise as anything else. Indeed, there
is a hint of “what the doctor ordered”
in his expression as Frith has drawn him.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
“Chevroford”: Visitors to Melbourne's
next agricultural show will be able to
feel the points of Australia’s first auto-
mobile to be built on mass-production
lines. Body is now being fitted to chassis
at a local factory. The Buckingham
Ward Motors people are so confident of
the permanence of the tariff wall that
they are expanding their capital from the
£lOO,OOO first contemplated to a million.
* * * si:
“H.A.L.”: The community-owned
hotel at Renmark (S.A.) reports net profit
of £5719 in the year just closed. It is
to be shared by the council (for road
and garden maintenance), the hospital,
the Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and the Sal-
vation Army among others ; and £3OO has
been set aside for a swimming pool. The
way in which this hotel is run is an object-
lesson. Queer that no other Australian
towns have copied the idea.
* * * %
“H. 8.”: The curse of trade in the
suburbs of Australian cities is the side-
line. The florist runs a lending library,
the newsagent sells cigarettes and to-
bacco, the grocer stocks stationery. Tak-
ings go up a few shillings a week, but
the other fellow’s business is cut to rib-
bons. Make every shopkeeper stick to
his own line and cease pinching his neigh-
bor’s customers, and things would be a
sight better in the suburbs.
* * * *
“C.H.F.”: The M.L. Government is
lifting the embargo on Australian oranges
to the extent of admitting South Aus.
fruit. Californian oranges have been
realising up to £2 per case, shop prices
being about three or four a shilling;
very small ones at that. In pre-embargo
times high-grade Australian oranges
could be got for 12 to 16 a shilling.
Maorilanders have discovered that the
Australian navel is immeasurably
superior to the article from California.
* * * *
“Cauboy”: There are rejoicings in
Melbourne musical circles now that the
Arbitration Court has exempted the pro-
posed professional and permanent sym-
phony orchestra from the award on the
ground that it is to be non-profitable and
cultural. The musicians who fought for
reasonable remuneration for rehearsals
have lost the sympathy of music-lovers.
It is true that when they gave excel-
lent Sunday concerts at St. Kilda, admis-
sion by silver coin, 95 p.c. of the music-
lovers turned up with only threepenny-
bits in their pockets; but this was an
unfortunate coincidence.
* * * *
“Old P.”: Tas. growers and shippers of
apples are after a Commonwealth sub-
sidy “to save the industry from extinc-
tion." The demand is for a guarantee
of 4s. 6d. per case f.o.b. port of ship-
ment ; it is not to be paid if the price
realised overseas is 4s. 6d. a case plus
transport and selling charges. But unless
apples fetch about 10s. a bushel in Lon-
don, the Australian taxpayer will have
to throw something into the orchardist’s
hat. If the overseas price drops to Bs.
(much of this year’s export realised less)
the taxpayer’s contribution would be 2s.
a case on, say, a normal Tas. export of
2,500,000 cases—£2so,ooo. And three
other States are in the apple-export trade.
* * * *
“C.W.C.”: A lad in my Perth office,
drawing 12s. 6d. a week (the commercial
award rate is 12s. 2d.), applied for a job
in the P.M.G.’s Department. He sat for
his exam., passed, and one morning got
an urgent telegram instructing him to
report for duty as a telegraph-messenger
boy ; wages, 30s. Next day another tele-
gram arrived advising him he was to be
attached to the Taxation Department at
355. 6d. On the third day came a letter
countermanding the second telegram and
reappointing him to the telegraph-mes-
senger service. How does the P.M.G.
expect to make ends meet when he pays
messenger boys so much more than the
everyday commercial house which is hard
put to it to make ends meet?
* * * *
J. W. Fletcher, for the defence:
Chiropractic, slated by “Gen. Prac.” 43.
16/8/’33), is a recognised form of manipulating
healing. Forty-one of the forty-eight States in
U.S.A. have passed laws giving chiropractic legal
recognition. This could never have been obtained
without results. The professional education
required is from three to fours years’ tuition at
a recognised chiropractic college, and before
one can obtain a license to practise one must
also pass a State board examination. The M.L.
and Australian Chiropractors’ Association admits
to membership only those who have a diploma
from a reputable chiropractic college. The
person referred to by “G.P.” is not a member.
In the 1932 telephone directory, he classifies
himself as a naturopath. Because this person
has been indiscreet it is hardly fair to fully
qualified chiropractors that ridicule should be
thrown on their profession. An article in (he
British “Medical Journal” of October 24, 1931,
by Thomas Marlin, M.D., endorses spinal mani-
pulation-in other words, chiropractic. I do
not think the “Medical Journal” would sponsor
quackery.

Oscar Asche, who has stepped into the
limelight over the bodyline business,
was famous in his younger days for his
culinary fastidiousness. He invented a
patent portable cooker which accom-
panied him on all his travels. Once he
demonstrated its talents to a Victorian
school, and when he attended the Royal
tennis courts in Melbourne his private
chef always went with him, carrying the
inevitable cooker. Oscar has grown no
thinner with advancing age and would
be a problem for any bowler who
honestly wanted to hit the wicket.

Bengal’s Legislature has at last steeled
itself to clean up the Calcutta Corpora-
tion, which for ineptitude and corrup-
tion has for years been a byword even
in India. In addition to working muni-
cipal “jokes” which made even the Syd-
ney Tammany regime of other days seem
an aldermanic kindergarten, the Corpora-
tion has been a harbor for supporters of
terrorism and civil disobedience. The
“right” people never paid taxes, and
money that did come in was thrown to
the four winds. The Corporation was
largely Hindu in composition, and has
been an eloquent illustration of what is
waiting when the Government of India
by Indians for Indians— some Indians —
becomes an accomplished fact.

“Chevroford”: Motor manufacturers
are now building radio sets in their
new models, and have conducted ex-
haustive investigations into the question
of whether listening to meditation music-
while speeding home from a party will
cause drivers to have accidents. Psycho-
logical experts report that the subcon-
scious mind concentrates on the radio
and leaves the conscious mind free to
pay attention to the traffic. One can’t
help wondering, however, what view a
Judge would take of a plea that the
driver of a car was listening-in at the time
of the accident. One result of installing
radio in cars is improvement in construc-
tion owing to the necessity for eliminating
vibration, noise and interruption from
the electrical circuits.
“Larrapinta”: The latest stunt of the
Flying Mollisons may have been with-
out an atom of practical value (B.
2/8/’33), but some go’od could be done
by these limelight artists if they were to
carry a light but valuable cargo of birds,
of species which cannot stand a long
sea voyage. Maoriland, for example, is
only occasionally visited by a few odd
specimens of the swallow tribe ; the next
trans-Tasman flier could take over a few
hundred pairs of the most useful of all
feathered creatures and thus establish a
bird there which has defied all attempts
to acclimatise it in the ordinary way.
The next man who crosses the Pacific
from America by air could bring to Aus-
tralia a few hundred of the most beau-
tiful and harmless of all things—-the
American humming birds.

Dr. E. P. Metcalfe, Vice-Chancellor of
Mysore University, who is in Australia
on a holiday, controls one of the most
dispersed universities in one of the most
thickly-schooled States on earth. The
29,469 square miles of southern India
which Cornwallis and Harris took (with
the modest aid of Captain Lachlan Mac-
quarie and some other officers afterwards
well known in Australian history), and
which Wellington afterwards governed,
boasts 6871 public and 1131 private
schools to serve its 6,000,000 people —
one to every 3.68 square miles and one
to every 732 of the population. The
university includes the Engineering and
Medical Colleges at Mysore, as well as
the Royal Colleges at Mysore and a
matriculation High School. Who can
deny that intensive education is needed
in a country where two members of the
Council recently were Sri Kantirava Nas-
imharaja Wadiyar Bahadur and Rajkar-
yaprasakta Diwan Bahadur?

R. J. Tillyard, one of Australia s world
figures in science, nearly had the unplea-
sant experience during his recent visit
to America as a delegate to the Pan-
Pacific Science Congress of being per-
manently tucked away by one ol
America’s million-odd ornate morticians.
Tillyard is Chief Commonwealth Ento-
mologist, F.R.S., Fellow of the Linmean
Society, D.Sc. of Cambridge and D.Sc.
of Sydney. Until he was 32 years old
he was a science and mathematical master
at Sydney Grammar School, but, develop-
ing an interest in entomology, he
secured a research scholarship at Syd-
ney University, and within seven years
was Chief of the Biological Department
of the Cawthron Institute, Nelson (M.L.).
He has published two important books
and about 150 scientific articles on all
orders of insects in journals throughout
the world.

“Manuka”: The erection at Patea
(M.L.) of a memorial to the Maori navi-
gator Turi (B. 9/8/’33) has unleashed a
lot of history about the 500-years-dead
seafarer. He left his first home in Tahiti
owing to domestic troubles, having mar-
ried a second wife with whom the first
didn’t agree. Removing himself and the
second Mrs. Turi to an islet of the
Friendly group, he fell foul of a power-
ful tohunga (priest) of that locality, and
felt his life was in danger. So he built
the great seagoing canoe Aotea, and,
with his second wife, sailed to Maoriland,
so tradition says, “without incident.”
There is a legend that in his old age he
“went back to Hawaiki.” Whether that
be so or not, no man knows his burial-
place. There’s a controversy as to
whether the name of Turi’s canoe was
Aotea or Aotea-roa, but the authorities
are all against the latter reading. Aotea-
-1 roa, by the way, though used by W. P.
Reeves as a synonym for the whole of
Maoriland, refers only to the North
Island.
Switzerland celebrated the 642nd anni-
versary of its confederation on August
1, which shows what can be done in
a country which does not take politics
and politicians seriously: The population
of 4,000,000-odd manages with a Federal
Parliament of 242 members and an
elected Ministry. The President gets
£l4OO a year, and each Minister £l2BO ;
there are only seven Ministers against
the customary 12 in N. S. Wales. In the
local cantonal councils, which are glori-
fied municipal bodies, service is hon-
orary. However, you could scarcely call
the place a country by our standards—
its national debt, including that incurred
to build a magnificent all-electrified rail-
way system, was last year a little less
than £300,000,000, which is about a third
less than the combined Federal and
State liabilities of N. S. Wales; and its
annual revenue is £24,000,000. About
£20,000,000 comes from Customs and
excise, the remaining £4,000,000 embrac-
ing every form of tax, license lee or fine
in vogue.

“Spasebo”: Like all demagogues, Hit-
ler gets most of his alleged wisdom at
second-hand. His anti-Semitism is a
crude reflection of Nietzsche’s hatred of
the Jews for being the creators of Chris-
tian “slave-morality.” His anti-feminism
is a caricature of Nietzsche’s horror of the
Brunhilde type of women who subjugate
men through their weakneses. His cam-
paign for giving jobs only to alleged
“Aryans” is a pale imitation of Nietz-
sche’s notion of the superman who can
only be achieved by a racially pure aris-
tocratic stock breeding for excellence.
(The Germans are anything but racially
pure, in any case.) His demand for the
return of the ex-German colonies (whose
trade with the Fatherland was never more
than two per cent.) is a practical expres-
sion of Nietzsche’s recognition that the
Will to Power implies expansion at the
expense of others. His latest pronounce-
ment, “Strong men are our protectors,
not strong philosophers,” derives from
Nietzsche’s contempt for academic adu-
lation of the old, as against courageous
affirmation of the new. Nietzsche is
a mine for the quotation-seeker, and you
can find anything in him to suit your re-
quirements. But he despised the herd
and the herd-leader, and above all he
despised his fellow-countrymen.


NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
In Memoriam
“El V.”: On August 28 the Brisbane
“Courier” and Brisbane “Daily Mail” will
become Siamese twins—the “Courier-
Mail.” To me, who was bred on the “Mail”
and worked later on the “Courier,” it
is a sad sight to see these rivals arm in
arm. The old “Mail” deserved a better
fate, for it was a brave rag, never
daunted by vicissitude nor appalled by
the sight of death, which, of old, seemed
always imminent to it. When I shared
one of three rickety tables on the un-
stable first floor 25 years ago, it was a
gloriously Bohemian office.
True, one of our many editors, Asher,
would turn up in a silk hat on garden-
party days, and there were about half
a dozen leader-writers fairly shimmering
with university degrees and bristling with
hatred of the Government; but the staff
of reporters were a romantic lot. Par-
liament was done by a cousin of Rud-
yard Kipling who wrote light verse as
other men write business letters. With
him went a son of Barbara Baynton who
afterwards became renowned as an in-
ternational fencing champion ; and there
was a cable editor who lived in a cup-
board under the stairs with a lot of news-
papers and a past that included service
with the London “Times.” The rats used
to eat his “lunch” every night till I pre-
sented him with a carpet snake, which he
took at first for an act of God.
We had a man who had been sacked
from a theological college for swearing
at an archbishop, and another who after-
wards went into the beauty-cream busi-
ness and made a fortune. Our one
concession to feminine weakness was
Marie Irvine, who did three men’s work
on the sort of salary they pay an office
boy these days—the chief-of-staff, by the
way, earned £5 a week.
And work.... Our hours were seven
days a week —“You can go when
you’ve finished.” We did not know the
meaning of night off, much less of day
off. Listen, you A.J.A.-ites of 1933, to
this record from the “Mail” annals of
1908:
“Monday, 9 p.m.: Left for Blackail
Central Queensland, 800 miles away, with
four Ministers to see railway opened.
Tuesday, 4 p.m.: Arrived Rockhampton.
Telegraphed and mailed four columns of
speeches and deputations before 11 p.m.
Wednesday: Spent day helping expert
driver of party’s motor-car to find out
how to drive it, at the same time send-
ing away another three columns. Left
at 6 p.m. for Blackail with party and all
the champagne that could be bought in
Rockhampton. Thursday: Arrived in
pouring rain. Sent off a few more
columns and attended ball. Caught
dengue fever.”
After a lot of motoring and lorry-
riding I arrived back in Brisbane
on Saturday at 6.40 a.m., having
written 14 columns since leaving
and travelled nearly 2000 miles. Found
myself detailed for a funeral (they
were funerals then —it meant collecting
a couple of hundred names and writing
them out) and a sporting fixture and a
theatre, with the laying of a foundation-
stone by Cardinal Moran next day. There
was a record crowd at the last-named
show and the platform, being rushed, col-
lapsed. We reporters had literally to sit
at the feet of his Eminence straining
our ears among a sea of Hibernian legs
to catch the flying words of one of the
fastest speakers on the continent.
Going home to get a bite of tea before
writing a couple of columns, I collapsed
and knew no more till I saw the paper
next morning and found that my two
rivals, Firmin McKinnon (now “Courier”
editor) and Flynn, of the “Courier,” had
supplied my report for me, in addition to
doing their own job. The chief-of-staff
was very angry—he seemed to think 1
had collapsed on purpose and he said I
would never make a journalist.
They paid me 355. a week, to do that
sort of thing!
“Wen”: Kangaroos are learning to be
as wily as their compatriot the dingo.
At Pickanjinnie (Q.) a station-hand
named Weir shot an old-man kanga-
roo. The animal appearing to be dead,
Weir approached to skin him, when the
’roo kicked upwards, hitting the rifle
stock and exploding the gun. The bullet
entered Weir’s stomach, and he had to
spend a long while at Roma hospital.

“Wyara”: One of the Queensland
Government correspondence scholarship
winners last year was a pupil living on
an island off New Guinea. Another pupil,
grandson of a Queenslander, lives in
China, and others are in the New Heb-
rides and Northern Territory. One pupil,
at Windorah (Q.), 650 miles in a direct
lines from Brisbane, receives his lessons
by post through Adelaide (S.A.) —a 2500-
mile journey.
* * * *
“N. McA.”: Queenslanders share the
sorrow fell in Sydney at the death of
little Mrs. Niau. As a young bride
she came to Australia, her husband
caught by the glitter of the New
France scheme of the Marquis de
Ray. But the two were made of the stuff
of pioneers ; they went to N.Q. and were
among the first little group of sugar-
growers on the Daintree River. Then
came the death of her husband, and the
tiny Frenchwoman with the great heart
set herself to the bringing up of a son
and daughter by means of teaching and
writing. The son was killed in the Great
War ; the daughter, Miss Niau, one of
MRS. MAGGS: “Do yer still love yer ’usband in spite of th ’ two black eyes
’e gave yer?”
MRS. DAGGS ( sentimentally ): “Yes, dearie. I only wish I ’ad a few more eyes
to offer 'im."
Sydney’s brilliant teachers of French,
survives the mother to whom she was
devoted.
* * * *
“J”: The pioneer spirit is not dead.
A story of remarkable endurance and
determination comes from St. George
(Q.). Ted Jackson was rounding horses
in heavily-timbered country, when his
horse fell and threw him, kicked him and
broke his leg. To relieve the excruciat-
ing pain he crawled 200 yards to a dead
tree. He tore bark into strips for splints,
which he bound with cloth from his
trousers. Guided by the setting sun, he
crawled more than a mile to a bore-
drain. Darkness fell, and he spent the
night with only the meagre warmth of
a burning stump to shield him from the
bitter cold. After a further crawl of
200 yards in the morning, he was found
exhausted by his brother. Brother,
unable to move him, went for the bush
sister at Bollon. They hired a car and
returned—ten miles by car, then a walk
of six miles through heavily-timbered
country. From saplings and bags an
improvised stretcher was made, and they
carried Jackson to the road. They were
met by the St. George ambulance bearers.
Jackson said it would have been easier
if he had not been out of cigarettes.
“El V.”: If somebody at the Resurrec-
tion shouts “Does anybody here know
Arthur Sharland?” there will be a sudden
elevation of axe-chapped fists which will
shut out the sun, and a shout of “My
oath!” which will set every harp-
string in Glory vibrating. For this young
man —he is only 61 and a carpenter —
has done the work of setting up the
blocks for the woodchopping contests at
the Brisbane Show for the past genera-
tion. The axemen cheered him the other
day when he was presented with an axe.
“Woodchopping,” he said in an oration
—wives, please note! —“is a fine, healthy
and manly sport.” And so said Henry
VIII. and George Washington!
* * * *
“Pomona”: Rickets, a disease believed
to be peculiar to cold, dark countries, is
in Brisbane, and not in the children of
the poor only. This leads to two conclu-
sions—sunlight alone is not a preventive,
and popular dietary is seriously defec-
tive in quality. Where food is abundant
and cheap, boils, constipation and rotten
teeth are very common, while scurvy and
rickets occur. The outlook for the health
of young children receiving relief food
in Q’land is very serious. The right fresh
foods are relatively dear. The number of
people who take their meals out of paper
bags and tins is tragic. People who
should be producing fresh food are on
the dole. The quantity of milk consumed
in Brisbane per head per day is only
about one-eighth of a pint. If everybody
consumed a necessary quantity, produc-
tion would have to be increased at least
fourfold; if children got all they really
needed a tenfold increase would ensue.
Lack of statistics prevents me from com-
puting the consumption of eggs, fresh
fruit and vegetables, but from inquiries
I should say it is deplorably low. And
as to meat, the best parts of the animals
are called offal. England succeeded in
producing a C 3 population on beef, beer,
bread and margarine. Australia looks
like doing the same on tea and bread and
jam.
* * * *
“Wai-Hoi”: Area of cattle stations in
North Australia? I’ll nominate six tidy-
sized holdings. Victoria River Downs,
with 12,686 square miles, is a world-
beater, with Wave Hill runner-up with
10,712. Alexandria, on the Barkly Table-
land. having 10,512; takes third place.
Bradshaw’s, on the Victoria River side,
has 6800. Brunette Downs, on the table-
land, is close up with 6087, whilst the
Macarthur run, nearer to the coast and
off the tableland, takes the booby with
a niere 3904.

“Billy See"; Ringhi in his semi-civil-
ised state taking to clothes and tobacco
is commonplace, but even in a condition
of savagery he is not entirely unadapt-
able to innovation. For untold ages the
North Australian black used spear-heads
cunningly chipped from a splinter of
quartz. Then came the white man with
his glass bottles and porcelain telegraph
insulators, and at once Binghi adapted
himself to the superior material, chipping
marvellous glass points, some over 6in.
long. Now, however, he has taken to
metal, grinding deadly shovel-points out
of the fence-droppers which Vesteys and
others have so liberally spread over parts
of the Territory.
* * -Y~ tt
“Beefo”: Nature's transformation of
the claypan country about the Diaman-
tina and Georgina (s.-w. Q) after periodi-
cal floods shows what natural irrigation
will do. In that remote cattle country, in
certain periods some of the finest fat-
tening land in Australia, millions of tons
of water run to waste, when the rivers
flood, through soakage and evaporation.
There are times when a thirsty galah
wouldn’t get a drink where six months
previously flood waters were 60 miles
wide. A scheme for the conservation of
just a little of this wasted water would
bring something more than settlement to
an area where at present isolated cattle-
men are just gambling on the seasons.
* * * *
“Coolibar”: Black Brother of the
Northern Territory can be a pretty
elusive member when wanted by the
police. Late in September, 1932, a Cale-
don Bay (Gulf of Carpentaria) tribe
wiped out the Jap crew of a beche-de-
mer lugger, with the exception of one
survivor who brought back the news.
Nov. 3 of the same year saw Mounted-
Constables Morey and Mahoney starting
out from Darwin to arrest the murderers.
That was nine months ago, and accord-
ing to the latest advices the sole result
to date has been the fatal spearing of
Constable McColl, who was called in
later to help in the chase. Mahoney also
had a narrow escape, a spear passing
through his hat. Morey and Mahoney
are the two constables who cleaned up
the “Ouida” affair, in which three Japs
were murdered by six Treachery Bay
natives over the usual gin-and-tobacco
argument. That crime, which occurred
at the W.A. side of the Territory, took
over a year to clean up, the Japs last
seeing the light sometime in July, 1931,
while it was not until September of 1932
that five of the murderers were brought
into Darwin. And it was not until Feb-
ruary of the present year that Nimaluck,
the ringleader, was finally arrested.
Gals’ Gossip from Brisbane
Although Show week was over, there
was one more event —the Convoy Ball
at Lennon’s. The Canberra had left,
but some of the Australia’s men were
there, and the dance went with a swing.
Sir Leslie and his lady, who wore gold
satin, were present; they brought Mar-
jorie and Amy Smith with them. Mar-
jorie wore blue. Mrs. J. C. Macfarlane,
whose husband, Commander J. C. Mac-
farlane, stood close by, was official host-
ess. She was in bright red georgette.
The president, Mrs. A. E. Moore, wore
black (lace and mariette mixed). Among
the dancers were Commander and Mrs.
Farncombe, she in brick red, Captain
Macleod, Mrs. N. G- Roskruge, whose
lace frock was of foxglove pink, Miss
Shirley Lloyd (Harrow), with sweet-peas
giving a splash of color to her black
frock, and the Mayoral Greenes.
With the usual color pageant, the 1933
Parliament was opened by his Ex., who
wore a gorgeous uniform—he is a Privy
Councillor. Women dressed in their best
stood two hours waiting for the guns to
go off. Frocking was wintry. Mrs. Forgan
Smith was in Vandyke brown; Mrs.
Pease and Mrs. A. E. Moore were both in
black and white; Mr. Reg King’s wife was
in navy. There were not the usual num-
ber of after-ceremony tea parties. It is
whispered that prices were raised.
For the first time at any opening of
Queensland Parliament a Victoria Cross
winner, Sergeant H. Dalziel, took part.
In 1918 he won his medal; in 1933 he is
one of the unemployed.
In the Carlton Cabaret the old South-
portonians’ Association held a dance. lan
Grant was secretary, and president Wyn
Pike gave a hand of welcome to Bishop
Dixon, a former principal of the school.
All our very nice people turned up at
a Government House meeting to show
their interest in a dance to be held on
the Cathay next month for Sir Leslie
Wilson’s Boy Scout Fund. Anything
with the vice-regal patronage is sure of
success. In a few weeks this fund reached
£6OO. Mrs. Ross Philp is chairwoman,
and Jock Burchall will act as secretary.
If there are any more debs, left in Bris-
bane, the Glasgow lady has promised to
look after them.


LIFE—A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethought
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
The eisteddfod is in full swing, and
in the breast of juvenile and grown-up
the spirit of competition rears and bucks
and snorts “Come on, mount me. I’ll
carry you flying past the winning post.”
And even if individual nags aren’t up to
scratch in this year’s race, they’re all
stayers and will probably do better next
time. At the opening last Saturday, little
girls in white and small boys in slicked-
back hair unleashed pianos and fiddles
in the Railway Institute’s Hall and
carolled at the Town Hall in the evening.
Place and Power behind the micro-
phone launched the eisteddfod on a sea
of words as stodgy as a Sargasso ; the
only real ripple came when knight Sam
Walder pointed out a quiet gentleman
on the platform as the winner of the bari-
tone solo at the eisteddfod of 41 years
ago. The Premier, Lud Mayor Hagon,
Roland Foster and Charlie Lloyd Jones
were among the speech-makers. C.L. was
brief and as to the point as a balance
sheet, but poor Roland Foster couldn't
help being last on the bill, and it was
hardly fair that the audience at the back
of the hall whenever he paused should
have demonstrated by stamping that their
appetites were jaded.
The eisteddfod has assumed such
dimensions that you forget it is only a
sideline of Music Week and that other
activities of charm and culture are nearly
lifting the roof off many other buildings,
besides the seven halls where the 5000-
odd competitors meet in daily combat.
One of the most joyous and colorful
happenings was the Russian concert
arranged by tenor Charles Nicis, who
sang with sweetness and power the songs
of his native steppes in an outfit of red
Cossack boots that held in tether blue
satin breeches. These were topped by
a buff Russian blouse girdled with a sash
of gold and blue. Behind him for several
numbers were grouped a Balalaika
orchestra. This was composed of Rus-
sian stringed instruments played by a
group of musicians in peasant costumes
of pink, blue, green and gold, the girls
wearing high gilt hairdresses. Wild Cau-
casian and Boyarina dances were demon-
strated by members of the Burlakov
Lightfoot ballet and the whole thing was
as exhilarating as a samovar of boiling
tea laced with vodka.
The Troubadour Ball was not, perhaps,
as spectacular as the organisers intended,
but it had a few smiling and colorful in-
terludes that lifted it well out of the ruck.
The first was when the minstrel, in green
and gold doublet, green hose and the long
peaked soft leather shoes of his day,
stepped slowly down the staircase from
the gallery to the floor of the Blaxland
Galleries after a golden voice had pro-
claimed itself the eternal Troubadour. The
minstrel’s arrival was followed by a flight
of young ladies who skimmed across the
polished floor in butterfly-hued velvets
and satins. Their high-peaked head-
dresses were of lustrous white satin, and
from the peaks flowed white veils, accord-
ing to the spring fashion of Italy around
about the year 1200. They surrounded
the Minstrel in a ring of bubbling, laugh-
ing girlhood, and very naturally enacted
a scene from D’Annunzio’s “La Fran-
cesca da Rimini.”
A voluble, vivacious young son of Italy
named Desto later strolled on the floor
and by gesture and picture (he set up an
easel with illustrations) told stories from
the “Orlando Furioso” of Ariosto, whose
fourth centenary the ball honored.
Around the red lacquer tables young
Italy sat with Australian friends ; one
table, that presided over by Mrs. Fiaschi,
was entirely surrounded by Queenslanders
—this was a gesture of recognition of the
funeral honors paid by Italy to Bert
Hinkler. Mrs. Fiaschi, a Bundaberg girl
herself, was one of the belles of the ball.
With her straightly-drawn-back heavy
brown hair and girlish figure .she re_
minded one of a grown-up Alice-in-Won-
derland. Her frock was of grey and
black glazed chiffon and was girdled by
a black cire ribbon sash. The arrival of
Italy’s Consul-General and his Marchesa
was heralded by the Italian National
Anthem and the not-very-inspiring
Fascist Hymn. The Marchesa went
richly clad in white satin and sables ,
black velvet was worn by ihe French
Consul’s authoress-wife. Mungo MacCal-
lum and his tall lady (in flowing lilac
laces), Dr. and Mrs. Baccarini and the
Brigadier-General Mackays were others
in the official group.
At a nuptial mass at St. Christopher’s,
Canberra, two old Territory families were
united. The bride was Eileen Corkhill,
and the ’groom was Ted Morrison, of
Tralee, Tugranong. The Morrisons
have been leading lights of the Quean-
beyan and Territory districts for many
years, while the Corkhills occupy por-
tion of the grant given to John McPher-
son in 1831. Four priests, including the
Rev. Father Morrison, brother of the
bridegroom, made the knot secure.
The really fashionable spot last week
was the Savoy Theatre, when the girls
from Doone put on “Nine Till Six in
aid of the Bush Book Club. Audrey
Nicholson as Mrs. Pembroke held the in-
terest from the first till the last curtain,
and her severely-cut and yet very feminine
dove-grey frock evoked the long ah! of
admiration. One thrilling moment for a
girls’ school was when all the manne-
quins changed their frocks in view of the
audience and stood in cami-knickers.
Although those worn by Anne Gordon
(she was a poor little Cockney) were only
calico, she managed to look just as sweet
as her satin-clad sisters.
Sydney’s just-discovered coloratura
soprano Grace Simpson gazes into a smil-
ing future from this Bulletin photo.
Grace has a voice that goes mounting as
easily as a lark’s up to top G and be-
yond. The voice is very true and Grace
is - quite a good musician. She sang the
“Lucia” arias and “Caro Nome” at the
Institute of Journalists’ party last Friday
in the Education Department’s Gallery,
accompanied by teacher Leslie Mac-
Callum’s flute and Ernest Woodgate
at the piano. The Lane Cove girl goes
to Europe next year with her eyes wide
open to the hard work ahead. “What
other Australians have done I can do.
I suppose they all felt frightened in the
beginning,” she confided.
Mary Gilmore, 68 last week, has
attained the distinction of being Aus-
tralia’s oldest and foremost woman poet.
Certainly she is the continent’s most
active poet of her sex ; and when the
Fellowship of Australian Writers gath-
ered around her with a birthday party
there were loud cheers from everybody.
The affair filled the Lyceum Club, and,
after happy song and speech and reci-
tation, Mary emerged a life-fellow of the
F.A.W. She also carried off a fountain-
pen and a radiator as earnest of her
fellow-members’ goodwill. President
George Mackaness and secretary Mar-
jorie Quinn arranged the flutter, which
was perfect in every detail, even to the
beautifully-iced birthday cake which
Mary cut at the long table at the head
of the room. This was then distributed,
and you could take a slice home to
dream on. Mary’s little speech was a
thing to be remembered ; so were the
hearty singing of “She’s a Jolly Good
Fellow,” and the mountain of telegrams
and letters, from not only every corner
of Australia, but from England and
America.
When the Macdhui leaves for the Solo-
mon Islands to-morrow week, Sister Amy
Richardson will sail back to the hospital
she founded at Burnuotui in the island
of Buka. For two years this lion-hearted
nurse has run the hospital, single-handed
except for the periodic visits from the
Government doctor, who is 150 miles
away, and the medical assistant, 30 miles
distant in Buka Passage. There’s no vil-
lage around the hospital: therefore the
natives from all villages make for it, and
sometimes there are as many as 40
patients in the palm-leaf structure. A
wood deal of the work of the healing
station is directed towards infant welfare,
though malaria, tropical diseases and T.B.
are not neglected. The hospital is
attached to the Marist Mission, and
Bishop Wade, of the northern Solomons,
the youngest bishop in the world at the
time of his consecration, takes a special
interest in it. Sister Richardson is a
Turnut girl; her father’s station was Bil-
lapalap in Adelong. She is an ex-pupil
of Rose Bay Convent, a trainee ot St.
Vincent’s, and is well known down
Wagga way. Her work is one of love, as
will be that of the two volunteer nurses,
one from Tasmania, one from Victoria,
who travel down with her this trip. Photo,

Another young Osborne changed her
name last week. She was Marjorie, the
younger daughter of the Seppie Osbornes,
of Latimer-road, Rose Bay, and she be-
came Mrs. Arthur Cobcroft on a sun-
washed afternoon. Her frock was a
priceless affair of real ivory Mechlin lace ;
the tube veil was only waist-length and
was banded with a silver ribbon finished
off with a knot of orange blossom, ihe
vows were blessed in the Osborne home
by Father Loughlin, rector of River-
view, the ’groom’s old school. Although
the wedding was on a subdued note as
far as the number of invitations was con-
cerned, the decorations and the clothes
of the guests bore that price-regardless
look that is the hall-mark of the swagger
knot-tying. The display of orchids could
hardly be excelled by the Botanic Gar-
dens. The bride carried them in white
and gold tones, and all the guests had
sprays, the expensive blooms having
been brought from Tasmania, Victoria
and Queensland for the great day. Bride’s
sister Beryl, who ’maided, struck an
almost revolutionary note by carrying a
posy of primroses.
This Letter blew into the Broadcast
House to see as well as hear Maggie
Teyte and Tudor Davies in the immortal
meeting of the poet and the flower-girl
in “Boheme.” Maggie, slim, seductive
and as fresh of cheek as of voice, trailed
a peach-pink lace frock that flashed
golden under the lights, and acted as
vividly as though facing an audience as
large as the one she was singing to.
Student of De Reszke and protegee of De-
bussy, who chose her to create the part
of Melisande in his opera, the lady’s
enunciation is perfection, her vowel
sounds a joy to the ear.
A black frock with a narrow white
scarf neckline and a black droop hat
dashed with white were worn by Miss
Teyte when she faced three or four hun-
dred business girls at lunch in David
Jones’s auditorium. The frock was
shorter than we are wearing them, and
you mused whether this is fashion’s latest
decree or just that Maggie Teyte’s legs
and ankles are adorable. She told the
girls that 50 per cent, of success is seri-
ous work. But she failed to add that the
other 50 per cent, is a master-key to the
door of opportunity.
Elliott Napier, the Institute of Journal-
ists’ new president, was toastmaster at
the P.E.N. dinner last week. Knight
Robert Garran brought his six feet four
and a half to the presidential chair, and
Polish poet Melech Ravitch made two
speeches, one in Yiddish, one in German.
The first was translated by Mr. Sted-
man, author of “Bread,” which the
Players’ Club produced some weeks ago ;
the second lost nothing in Lute Drum-
mond’s vivid presentation. There was a
great roll-up, and John Dailey brought
his fair-haired wife and Mr. and Mrs.
Ashton-Johnson, the last a cousin just
arrived from England. Gertrude Mack
came with sister Amy, and another
newly-returned was Jeanie Ranken. Jack
Abbott and lon Idriess were two of Aus-
tralia’s novelists present.
Full of dash and color was the ball
given by the officers of the St. George
Regiment. Hordern’s ballroom presented
a scene of spirited action when the band
beat out the regimental march, swinging
over the polished floor in fine style to its
own rhythm. There were fanfare
of trumpets and roll of drums, several
times repeated, as the great ones of the
evening were announced ; there was the
blaze of uniforms, the glitter of electrics
on medals and on a table full of trophies ;
there were the rich hues of many flowers.
Particularly lovely were the tall baskets
of pink camellias on the official table,
where Lieut.-Col. Douglas and Mrs.
Douglas, whose pink frock was caped in
gold sequins, did the honors. Here were
Brig.-Gen. Herring and daughter Diana,
Lieut-Col. Jackson and his wife, the A.
S. Allen couple and other uniformed
brass-hats and their ladies. On the table
of Lieut. Duffy St. George in replica
conquered his dragon, while a machine-
gun held the fort of the table of a fellow-
Loot. It was a good party, and a happy
memory for Lieut. D. D. Pitt to take
off next month —he goes to India.
“Burdekin the Less” is the title of the
Prince Alfred William Eppses’ new home
in Macquarie-street. It’s a tall, thin slice
of a house with a green door, and inside
it is furnished and decorated in the
French manner. In the front room on
the ground floor you can have morning
tea or afternoon tea at the gilt tables,
and coffee in the room at the back, where
a tall Chinese Madonna meditates on a
corner table.
Audrey, the second daughter of Mrs.
and the late Norman Macleod, and a

letin, has attained her majority, and is

Chatter
At Flemington on Saturday the only
forecast of the coming of a new season
was the appearance of a few sailor-shape
straw hats. The rest of the dressing
was wintry. Mrs. Finkelstein was there
in mink coat and a ruched toque of
velvet, of chocolate hue. With her was
her daughter Peggy, in tailored cloth suit
and black felt hat. Orchids nestled in
Mrs. Ross Grey Smith’s coat of dyed
squirrel fur. Mrs. Len Buxton, just back
from the U.S.A., sported a turban toque
of plaid tonings with her sulphur-colored
woollen frock. Several hats of soft
feathers were worn. Among those who
chose such millinery were Mrs. W. Bates,
feathers of wine-color being blended in
her largish model, which harmonised
with her garnet-red georgette gown, worn
beneath a fur coat. With Mrs. J. J.
Daly was her sister, Dr. Dora McMahon,
from Sydney, whose coat-frock was light
brown corduroy velvet with darker-toned
hat. A kolinsky wrap covered Mrs. Harry
Henty’s black frock.
A pleasant interlude between the last
race and theatre time was a tea-party at
No. 9 Darling-street, at which Mrs. D.
Stuart Murray and her daughter, Mrs. G.
Patrick Fairbairn, a recent bride, were
hostesses. Mrs. Murray’s gentian-blue
georgette gown was of tunic mode with
a coatee, and was topped by a small hat
of velour of the same shade; a sable
wrap was added. Beneath a coat of light
brown summer ermine, decorated with
a spray of orchids, Mrs. Fairbairn wore
a petunia-purple flat crepe frock, and her
hat was of velvet of deeper tone. Mrs.
Charlie Lyon’s three-piece suit of palest
grey-green blended with beige fur, and a
matching toque. Mrs. Robert Knox,
who sported millinery of black built on
the smoking-cap lines, was wrapped in
a velvet coat of putty hue. Mrs. Fred
Thiel had a biscuit-tinted gown beneath
a black caracul coat, allied to a black
velvet toque. A pierrot ruffle of black
coque feathers gave an original touch to
the all-black turnout worn by Mrs. Simon
Fraser. Mrs. Leslie Macdonald bright-
ened her black tailored suit with a coat
posy of primroses. The Lauchlan Mac-
kinnons, Mrs. Sydney Gullett, the Ted
Yenckens, Mr. and Mrs. Trevor Oldham,
General Chauvel and his wife, Mr. and
Mrs. Harry Whiting and Mrs. R. G.
Casey, sen., were in the throng.
A late afternoon sherry party was
given by Captain and Mrs. J. R. Stewart
at their new flat at Mandeville, Park-
street. Mr. and Mrs. Percy Blackbourn,
who are shortly leaving for a lengthy
stay in Maoriland, were guests of honor.
A flower stall made a glad showing
at the bridge party for the D.N.S. on
Thursday afternoon. Camellias, snow-
drops, daffodils and peach blossom were
sold by Mrs. P. E. Neil, Mrs. Loudown
Shand, Mrs. Leo Quick and Mrs. Fred
Krcrouse. Secretaries were Mrs. H. M.
Ramsay and Mrs. F. G. Cresswell. Vice-
Admiral Hyde’s wife was the organiser.
Mrs. Guthrie Robinson, a sister of Mrs.
Hyde, who is on a visit from Sydney,
presented a travelling rug, which was
raffled. Mrs. W. Seymour, Meta Power.
Barbara Lyon, Elaine Knox Knight and
Margery Stephens were amongst those
who handed round tea and cakes.
Mrs. Lindsay Mildred gave a late-
afternoon party at her Malvern home the
other day. Lovely flowers and glowing
fires made the reception-rooms cheery,
the hostess greeting guests in a floral
chiffon gown. Mari Macfarlane, a visi-
tor from N. S. Wales, who is on a visit
do Mrs. Mildred, wore draperies pat-
terned in green and beige tints.
; Past pupils of Kilbreda Convent, Men-
tone, put on their hop at No. 9 Darling-
street. Dorothy Cass, who was in
geranium-pink flat crepe, was the hon.
sec., with Nance Bannon, whose frock
was turquoise-blue velvet, as her lieu-
tenant. Pattie Drake, the only deb., wore .
white chiffon, and made her bow to the
president of the association, Mrs. J. A.
Cahill, whose black velvet gown was cut
jon princess-robe lines.
There were some frocks a little out of
the ordinary at the dance at the Rex in
bid of the Loreto Free Kindergarten.
Valerie Wallace Smith wore a model on
tunic lines of cerise angel-skin that had
a deep rucking of leaf-green velvet
'around the hem of the skirt. Lena Hope
trimmed a gold lame robe with a berthe
of black velvet; Merna Connell’s striped
crepe gown blended shades of orange,
white, black, brown and green. Hon. secs,
were Jill Ryan, whose white crepe de Chine
had a dash of emerald-green at the waist-
line, and Mary Fanning, whose white
satin gown flowed from beneath a long
coat of ivory chiffon velvet that had
a toga-like cape. Loma Boyd, who was
in black chiffon, Peggy Le Plastrier, whose
princess robe was of fuchsia hue, and
Pat Lightfoot completed the bunch of
organisers. In the throng of 300 were
Mrs. J. J. Daly, president of the kinder-
garten, whose black gown had a touch of
turquoise blue on the corsage ; Mrs. T. J.
Ryan, in draperies of mist grey georgette ;
Mrs. Fanning, Dr. and Mrs. J. Hamil-
ton, Mollie Warden and Mr. and Mrs.
J. B. Connell.
The ball of the 24th Battalion, Koo-
yong Regiment, was in Camberwell
Town Hall, decked for the occasion.
Twelve debs, in fluffy white gowns car-
ried posies of crimson blossoms and were
escorted by officers in mess uniform. The
wife of the C. 0., Lieut.-Col. S. G.
Savige, sported a chiffon frock of scarlet
with a touch of white satin about the
little cape.
The matinee performance at the
Athenteum for the D.N.S. on Friday
afternoon filled the house, and Society
(with a capital S) was well represented.
Lt.-Governor Irvine’s wife was there, and
received a posy. Compliments and con-
gratulations were bestowed upon the
organiser, Mrs. Colin Fraser, with whom
were associated Mrs. F. W. Thring and
Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Rolls. Mrs. M. M.
Phillips said the thanks of the Nursing
Society for the assistance given. The
programme included songs from John
Brownlee, an interlude from “The
Quaker Girl” by Cyril Ritchard and
Madge Elliott, sketches by “Tout Paris”
mummers and some dancing turns. At
the interval G. J. Mackay, Cyril Ritchard
and Clarkson Rose conducted an auction
sale. After the show the artists assembled
for tea at the Quamby Club at Mrs.
Fraser’s invitation.
A very tony affair was a mannequin
display, at which mummer Cyril Ritchard
announced the various creations. Dances
were stepped by Les Raphael and Pat-
ricia Nelson, and Margery Stedeford
warbled. Muslins, plain and crinkled,
fashioned into sleeveless frocks, all
flounces, frills and kiltings, with fussy
capes and sashes figured in the parade,
with millinery of the ethereal order.
Among the amateur mannequins were
Dorothy Parnham, who lately made her
debut as a talkie actress, Mrs. W. Ten-
nant Hunter (Phyllis Holmes Hunt that
was), Mary Guy Smith and June Baillieu.
Here is a very recent Broothorn pic-
ture of the wife of Vice-Admiral G. F.
Hyde. The lady, who hails from N. S.
Wales, is greatly interested in the R.A.N.
Friendly Union of Sailors’ Wives and
Mothers, an organisation that has under-
taken the making of garments for the
District Nursing Society’s After-Care
Home. Mrs. Hyde was organiser of last
week’s big bridge party at the Green
Mill, which provided funds for the union
to carry on its philanthropic work.
The “Voice That Breathed” was sung
at eventide at All Saints’ Church, St.
Kilda, for Margaret, otherwise Peggy.
younger daughter of the S. A. Clive
Kings, of East St. Kilda, and Harry, elder
son of Mr. and Mrs. A. M. Oliphant, of
Hawthorn. The bride’s ivory-tinted satin
gown, with its court train, blended with
the mellow tone of a long Limerick lace
veil. The daffodils that were mixed with
orchids in the sheaf she carried were in
harmony with the color scheme of the
setting. Nell Wimpole, Grace Oliphant
and Phyllis Mein were attendant ’maids,
with a little trainbearer, all in white chif-
fon frocks topped by wreaths of leaves
and yellow daisies. After-rejoicings were
at No. 9.
In the beginning of the war years Mrs.
Colin Fraser, a Canadian by birth, pic-
tured here by Broothorn, came to Mel-
bourne with her husband, and they liked
the city so well that they decided to stay.
Mrs. Fraser, who is a vice-president of the
N.C.W.. an active member of the S.P.C.A.
and a worker for Ihe Renown Free Kin-
dergarten, was recently elected president
of a committee to garner funds for the
District Nursing Society. Assisted by
Mrs. Thring and Mrs. Ernest Rolls, Mrs.
Fraser organised a very successful mati-
nee at the Athenaeum.
Looking upon a gown of the latest
build, the Chatterer was surprised to
note that it featured a great deal of
smocking, a form of stitchery that has
been out of vogue for years. The honey-
combing formed a yoke, and was also
used upon the puff sleeves, being the
only trimming the well-cut black flat
crepe gown boasted. On a one-piece
dress this embellishment is. most effective.
Perth’s winter gaieties:—■
Red coats, blue coats, red stripes, gold braid
and rainbow-ribboned medals almost outshone
the women’s frocks at the Naval and Military
Club’s Ball. Government House ballroom, be-
decked with flags, housed the cheeriest show
of the season. At the roll of drums Com-
mander Griffiths Bowen and Brigadier Martyn,
with their respective wives, stood by to receive
his Ex. and his lady, who was in soft beige
lace. Mrs. Martyn’s hovea silk crepe was
topped by a capelet; Mrs. Griffiths Bowen’s
georgettes were kingfisher blue; goffered pink
chiffon and lace clung to Mrs. Athol Hobbs’s
trim figure; Mrs. Lyon Johnson combined gold
tissue with ivory lace; Barbara Nairn’s milky
taffetas were sprinkled with pastel flowers; Mrs.
Doy Forrest gleamed silver and white; scarlet
touches appeared on Mrs. Cam Milne’s gold
crinkle crepe: feather trimming fluttered on
Mrs. Baxter Cox’s hyacinth-blue ninons; and
Mrs. McWhae, Helen Vincent and Flower
Southwood chose royal blue drapings.
The Claremont Yacht Club opened its doors
and closed-in its verandahs for its dance. Bunt-
ing, flags, palms and colored lights played their
parts, and the billiard tables carried supper
set mid bowls of Iceland poppies. Commodore
Lantzke kept a place of honor for the Royal’s
Commodore, Felix Levinson, who brought his
wife in floral maize taffetas. Mrs. Reg. Long
was smart in black and white; Mrs. Stan Bur-
ridge’s almond and olive greens were intricately
vandyked; Maude Mitchell’s flame flowers were
allied with mimosa taffetas; Ariel McGhie
danced in black flowered taffetas, and Jean
Moullin in sombre lace.
Two am. dram, performances served to the
public on the same evening were the Five
Arts Club production of “Tilly of Blooms-
bury,” with Melva Bartlett and Ned Zeisler in
leading roles, and the Perth College O.G.D.S.
in Noel Coward’s “I’ll Leave Tt to You.”
Ralph Stoddart was mirth-making as the
uncle, and Jean Hemy and Viola Bathgate made
admirable middle-aged mothers.
Mrs. Cecil Mason, wrapped in ivory satin
and beaded lace, presided over the L. A. B.
Club’s gathering in the Karrakatta Club hall,
with Dr. Borland, examiner for Trinity College,
as the lion of the evening. There was a con-
cert programme, and ten-minute papers on
modern music were read by Florence Hodd,
Ethel Ewins, Edward Black and Keith Devenish.
The glowing fire in the big open fireplace
at King’s Park Pavilion was the popular spot
during the Tennis Club dance; even the orch-
estra, half hidden by palms, was ensconced as
near as possible. Athole Clifton warmed her
toes in sherry lace; Gladys Hadley’s floral
taffetas were seen close to the flames; Mrs.
Len Spencer was alongside in maroon crinkle
crepe, and Dorothy Fallowes’s Egyptian-blue
laces caught the rays.
Erica Chandler, who toured the Common-
wealth to debate for the Uni., was given a
new motion to consider: “That she plight her
troth to Dr. Eric Underwood.'’ Carried, by
two votes to none.
A few lines from Adelaide:
flic Flying Corps Association’s Ball at the
Palais Royal was a bright affair. His Ex.
was unable to be present, but Lady Flore-Ruth-
ven, in sapphire-blue satin, and Rosemary
Fleischmann, in tango satin, were there. The
vice-regal party was received by Lieutenant-
Colonel D. V. J. Blake and Flight-Commander
Macdonald Moore. Mrs. A. M. Cudmore,
assisted by Mrs. F. Harcus, arranged the deco-
rations. There were about 600 present.
A committee of young matrons organised a
dance in St. Andrew’s parish hall, Walkervillc.
About 200 danced. Mesdames J. R. Bennett
and Ross Moncrieff were joint secretaries, and
14 other members split up the responsibility
for refreshments and decorations with admirable
results.
The Palais Royal was crowded for the Big
Store Ball. A fashion parade—men dressed
as women—occasioned much laughter. A
prominent Toe H worker, built on large lines,
appeared as Dame Fashion in gold satin, with
a train seven yards long and a Gaby Deslys
head-dress. There was a balloon stall, the
sellers wearing early-Victorian frocks and poke
bonnets.
Mr. and Mrs. A. F. Harding-Wilson and
their daughter, of Brisbane, who arc making an
extensive motoring tour, have arrived in Adel-
aide, and are staying at the Oriental Hotel.
They are accompanied by Mrs. A. E. Wilson
and Messrs. R. H. Wilson and W. A. Green.
The Speck continues to welcome the
vice-regal Clarks:
The Mayoral Ball in the City Hall was a
swanky affair. The decorations were a work of
art, with ropes of ivy between the pillars of the
lounges and hanging baskets of lovely early spring
blossoms. The pillars themselves were covered
with moss and had fern fronds topping them.
About 2000 dancers gyrated, and the galleries
were packed with onlookers. Twenty debs.,
like a flock of white pigeons, made their bobs
to vice-royalty. Lady Clark wore midnight-
blue chiffon velvet; the C.J.’s lady was in
emerald-green georgette and Mayoress Wignall
sported beige angel-skin lace. Mrs. McPhee was
in pale beige georgette, worn with a short
chenille velvet coatee in the same shade. The
Mayoress of Launceston was in black, as was
also Elliott Lewis’s lady.
Their Exes, must have thought Tasmania’s
population had been much understated when
they faced the public reception in Hobart Town
Hall. The crowd that streamed past the v.-r.
dais seemed unending. Music was played dur-
ing the afternoon by McCann’s orchestra, and
refreshments were attended to by an earnest
committee.
The Midland Hunt Club ran a point-to-point
steeplechase on the estate of the deputy-master,
George Gibson. A hill on the property made a
grandstand commanding a view of the whole
course. A strong field was out, and the race
was won by Mary Littlechild on her own marc,
Cinders. Trophies were given by George
Gibson, Jim Melrose and Arthur Crosby.
Rupert Agnew took a nasty toss, and there
were several minor mishaps.
Mrs. E. A. Peacock handed over her billiard-
room and drawing-room for a bridge party in
the interests of the Free Kindergarten. Masses of
prunus and almond bloom in bowls decorated
the rooms. A tea-committee served hot drinks
and toothsome eatables. * Mrs. Peacock and
daughter Margaret are spending the rest of the
winter in Melbourne.
The Art Society's winter exhibition is an
interesting one. Prizes have been offered for
paintings of Tas. landscapes and black-and-
white work, the judges being Mrs. Paterson,
Ethel Nicholls and W. J. Connor. Dorothy
Stonor and Mrs. Jones tie in the landscapes, and
Dorothy Stonor and Mr. Webb come level in
the black-and-white section.
Sybil and Rupert Lyons are still in ’Frisco,
where they arc enjoying themselves hugely.
They speak of returning next month on the
Monterey.
Douglas Caddy produced “The Ghost Train’’
in Launceston with a very capable company of
amateurs, and filled the house both nights.
Doris Eastbairn in the chief feminine role was
excellent.

Motherhood.
BY E. MARY GURNEY.
ALL the world was bedecked with
diamond dew when to Rachel, the
little red Shorthorn heifer, her first
calf. Ruddy, was born. As she licked
and suckled him shafts of gold light, like
fingers in a loved one’s hair, were run-
ning, richly tender, through the shining
green of grass and tree.
The calf was a big one, red like her-
self, thick-limbed and husky, filling her
heart with pride and anxiety, for he was
showing signs of wilfulness that boded
no good for his future.
He dragged at her tender little bag,
greedy, but in a ferment to explore the
immediate vicinity of this vast new world.
With a last savage bunt to make sure
that there was no drop of the rich yellow
milk remaining, he floundered past his
anxious little dam’s quarters, and stood
with his long legs propped out, sniffing
luxuriously at the clean morning air.
Rachel twisted about, mooing softly,
and nosed him, whereon he shook his
blunt, ugly head and floundered away
ill-temperedly towards the deep creek.
Rachel, gifted with an intelligence rare
in a beast, went after him, shouldering
him away, so that after one or two abor-
tive attempts to pass her he went stag-
gering and blundering off in the opposite
direction, emitting hoarse “blahs” of
frustration as he went.
Rachel followed helplessly, answering
his “blahs” with muffled moos, of which
he took not the slightest heed. On the
softly-swelling green hills that surrounded
her paddock the morning light was grow-
ing so that the dew glittered.
Beyond the green hills rose steeper
hills, sad with bracken ; behind them,
again, were hills sombre with virgin
bush.
Through the far end of the valley in
which Rachel’s calf had been born, she
could see the homestead and the group
of red outbuildings ; and from behind
the great, tremulous poplars rose a
clamor of dogs.
The sound of it filled Rachel’s heart
with dread. Hers was a sheltered, ordered
existence, guiltless alike of pain or fear,
save the recent pain of her travail and
her unreasoning terror of dogs.
A lapdog could stampede her. The
boy’s terrier could send her into head-
long flight. As for the sheep- and cattie-
dogs, when they appeared neither fence
nor stone wall could stop her.
Frantically she strove to stay her off-
spring’s blundering progress; but he
would none of it. If she headed
him in one direction, he merely floun-
dered off elsewhere, adding his indig-
nant infant bellowings to the myriad
sounds of the morning—the harsh, quest-
ing calls of Shogun, the great bull ; the
neighing of the distant horse; the
raucous crowing of a cock, away back
at the farmstead, mingling with the bark-
ing of the dogs and the waking bleat of
sheep that drowsed on the round hills.
Panting but undefeated, Ruddy pre-
sently staggered into the fence that sepa-
rated the paddock from the road. Con-
tact with the wires, so far from daunting
him, seemed to rouse in him a very tem-
pest of mulish obstinacy. At first he
simply banged himself along it, ripping
out a staple here and there, and knock-
ing the battens askew ; but presently he
got his head through, and, brought up
against a post, heaved and pushed until
his shoulders and forelegs followed his
head.
A moment later he was standing in
the middle of the road, blaring with in-
dignant fright because his distracted dam
no longer sniffed and slobbered at his
quarters.
Rachel pawed at the turf, snorting and
bellowing in an ecstasy of apprehension,
but the calf merely stood stolidly in the
middle of the white road and insisted
that she come to him.
Panting and frothing at the mouth,
Rachel blundered along the fence, reared
suddenly against it, and heaved herself
over, breaking a post and two wires, and
cutting herself sorely about the udder
and hind legs. In her anxiety she
did not notice the sting of the cuts, until
Ruddy, idiotically overjoyed at their re-
union, turned and tugged at her torn
teats. Then, instinctively, she kicked,
catching him squarely on the nose.
Blowing with surprise, Ruddy backed
away, shaking his head and prancing
awkwardly at the pain of it.
Rachel dribbled over him feverishly,
and he, satisfied once more, staggered off
up the road, tacking here and there in
short, uncontrolled bursts, but covering
the ground with surprising rapidity.
Rachel, in an agony of disquiet, trotted
desperately after him, standing beside
him and nosing him anxiously whenever
he paused to investigate the odd, intrigu-
ing things that cropped up under his
nose.
The road went over a rise and down
into a valley ; and there, where the bush
ran down to the road, was an open gate.
It led away to a hill that was covered
with virgin bush.
Through the gate blundered Ruddy,
nearly spent now, and after him stag-
gered his dam.
After one or two attempts to force
his way in at the sides, Ruddy followed
the narrow cattle track that twisted away
down the hill, plunging straight into the
heart of the bush. In shuddering trepi
dation Rachel followed him.
Half a mile away, near the bottom of
a deep, gloomy ravine, the calf, with
unpremeditated suddenness, sat down,
and then rolled sulkily on to his side,
panting and exhausted. Rachel, parched
with thirst, hovered anxiously over him.
licking his sweat-damp flank and trying
to coax him to his feet again so that
they might go down to the water that
she could hear tinkling through the fern
a few yards below; but Ruddy, find-
ing himself unexpectedly hot and weary,
lay perversely supine, with his eyes
tightly closed, finding comfort in the
rasp of his mother’s wet tongue.
Presently he sighed deeply, stretched
his head back and slept luxuriously in
the damp mould.
Here the tangled undergrowth twisted
all about the track, so dense on either
side that even had she wished the little
cow could not have forced her way into
it. She could go either forward or back ;
but though the curious silence weighed
on her she had no thought of retreat.
Now that she was here, standing with
head drooped and heaving flanks above
her sleeping calf, there was a strange,
new tingling in her blood, as though an-
cestors long-forgotten spoke, calling her
away to a life of primitive ecstasy where
man and man’s works could no more
concern her.
Ruddy lay,in the narrow track between
her and the bottom of the ravine, but
presently she stepped over him. and went
on, leaving him there,'feeling that he was
securely hidden from all prying eyes.
To reach the water she had to slide
down a rotten peaty bank, through
breast-high fern and the decayed limbs
of trees ages old.
Above her head as she drank a fan-
tail fluttered, chattering and scolding, and
a little rio-rio hopped silently from
branch to branch of a graceful lacebark ;
but of other life there was neither sight
nor sound.
Sighing gratefully, she lifted her drip-
ping muzzle and stood awhile knee-
deep before she climbed back up the
bank into the narrow track, which twisted
tortuously round dense thickets and
fallen trees.
Following it leisurely, she nosed here
and there in the undergrowth, but fodder
there was none. Suddenly, just round
the bend where she had left her calf,
there rose a horrible babel —Ruddy’s
frantic bawlings mingled with the yab-
bering of a dog.
With a roar that shattered the still
heart of the bush, Rachel lunged for-
ward ; she met Ruddy flying round the
bend with a large black dog close on his
heels.
So wildly was the calf travelling that
he drove straight between Rachel’s fore-
legs and out behind her; and Rachel
and the dog met face to face.
Had there been room to turn she would
have faced about and followed her calf
in headlong flight, but as it was, with a
dead tree flanking her on one side and
a sheer drop through the tangled under-
growth on the other, she had no choice
but to stand her ground and fight it out
with her dread foe.
With a little bellow of despair she
lunged forward. The dog, old in the
strategy of fighting cows, endeavored to
slip aside. He brought up against the
fallen tree, and howled once as, with
her full weight behind them, the little
cow drove her sharp horns home.
She stumbled forward over him, be-
yond the dead tree, and twisted round,
with no thought of flight in her now that
the foe was between her and her calf.
The black dog lay quite still, no longer
caring whether she went or stayed.
Head down, tail high, eyeballs star-
ing from their sockets, Rachel tore past
and away down the track, and as she
went she bellowed hideously with fear
of the thing behind, with anxiety for the
calf she could neither see nor hear.
It was half an hour before she came
up with him, far up the track on the
opposite side of the ravine. Calling deso-
lately, he was standing in the middle of
a natural clearing, where coarse grass and
tussock grew rankly on the fringe of a
turgid pool.
Rachel grazed hungrily, while Ruddy
tugged with vicious eagerness at her limp
udder; and presently she sat down in
the speckled shade and began to chew
her cud, in no wise disturbed by his
aggrieved complaints.
The sun went down and night shrouded
the bush, cold and impenetrably dark.
Ruddy, hungry and exhausted, slept fit-
fully, snuggled against her warm side ;
but all through the night hours Rachel
stayed awake.
The rest of the world was light a full
hour before day came clipping shyly
down among the trees. Rachel rose
stiffly, and Ruddy drank his fill from
her bag, distended again now and full
alter her rest and the coarse fare of
which she had partaken overnight.
Now that he was fed again the husky
red calf lost his inertia and set out on
his explorations, no longer uncertain on
his feet.
He would have taken the track back,
but Rachel would have none of it. She
headed him determinedly up the hill,
where the bush gradually thinned to
scrub and the tussock grew more plen-
tiful. Here and there rabbits sat on
their haunches, staring stupidly, and
numerous birds, uncannily silent, fol-
lowed their progress on wings that made
no sound.
Rachel, with a new determination that
lent her dignity, went her own way, and
after a while Ruddy, though he resented
it bitterly, learnt to follow; so, alter-
nately grazing and wandering, they came
out on to the hill’s crest and saw far
away over the waving treetops the long
green sweep of the plains. Rachel eyed
them with mild curiosity, for into her
life as yet had come no flat land.
But. in the heart of a beast distance is
no enchantment. For them the here and
the present is all-sufficient, and Rachel,
her curiosity appeased, sought a sheltered
spot in the sun, where, with many a
gusty sigh, she sat herself down to chew
her cud, while Ruddy, blinking in the
strong light, wandered hither and thither,
aimlessly exploring.
The noontide sun was high before they
were disturbed by the rattle of hoofs on
stone. Against the sky n gaunt red cow
with wide, red-rimmed eyes and saliva-
covered muzzle stood gazing down at
them.
Rachel scrambled to her feet, filled
with a vague terror. She called to Ruddy,
who, a hundred yards below her, gave
an idiotic “blah,” and ran straight at
the awful apparition, which promptly
lowered its head and charged.
Rachel emitted a choking roar and
charged, too, at right angles.
Though she must have weighed at least
two hundred pounds less than the
stranger, she caught the big cow fairjy,
knocking it flying down the hill, and be-
fore it could regain its feet she had
herded the indignant Ruddy in front of
her, and away over the hill, back to the
shelter of the bush.
All that afternoon they travelled, wind-
ing up and down narrow tracks, through
the dim silence of the bush : but towards
evening they came out on the edge of it,
to the first grass that Rachel had eaten
for 36 hours. All through the dusk and
far into the night she grazed, nosing
among the blackberry and tangle of
brush and bracken ; then, bedded down
with Ruddy beside her, she slept as she
had not slept for many nights.
In the red riot of a wild dawn a sound
wakened her rudely—the harsh staccato
bark of a dog.
With Ruddy beside her she fled back
to the fastness of the bush.
At first, though she travelled swiftly,
she did not realise that the hunt was
hard on her heels. Here the trees were
set far apart, and the undergrowth was
not thick enough to bar progress. For
half a mile she kept on—then stopped
and gazed back fearfully, eyes staring,
ears twitching nervously.
From the leafy gloom came the sound
of following hoofs, of muffled voices and
the occasional whine of a dog.
Snorting with terror, she sped on, with
Ruddy, no longer self-willed and obdu-
rate, but faint-hearted with the con-
tagion of her terror, scampering against
her shoulder.
Presently the bush grew denser, im-
peding her progress, until she came sud-
denly on a track that wound above a
deep ravine: but now the hunt was
almost upon her, and as she labored
along the twisting trail a dog gave tongue
no more than a few yards behind.
Half-crazed with terror, yet fierce with
the sublimity of her motherhood, she
pulled up and faced about.
A tan dog, monstrous in the green
gloom, raced straight at her. Away
through the bush was new sound —crash-
ing as of some heavy beast forcing its
way through the undergrowth. That
sound stopped suddenly.
The hound closed with her, but she
fought him off with frantic sweeps of
her lowered head. There was a sharp
snapping sound, and Rachel, conscious
of a searing pain in her shoulder, slipped
sideways and went crashing down into
the ravine.
Above a triumphant voice shouted
“Got her, boys!”
Rachel lay* as she had fallen in the
dense mass of rotten tree and fern at
the bottom of the ravine. Over her
head the tangle of creeper had closed
back so that none could see where she
had slipped through.
Overhead a dog barked excitedly, and
the sound of new arrivals kept breaking
the snatches of conversation.
One said, “I wanted dog tucker, but
I'm not going down there after it!”.
The sounds moved further off.
From Ruddy, suddenly immensely wise
in the laws of the wild, came no sound.
Rachel rolled groggily to her feet and
stood swaying and gasping.
Through a tiny hole in her shoulder
blood oozed in frothy bubbles, and she
found that she could scarcely put that
hoof to the ground. With infinite care
she began to force her way along the
ravine. Her progress was painfully slow,
and presently the froth on her muzzle was
tinged with red, for the bullet had
touched her lungs. But somewhere on
the ravine top her calf waited in frozen
silence, and the urge of her motherhood
drove her relentlessly on.
A hundred yards from where she had
fallen the bank shelved back through
the tangle of creeper, and up it Rachel
dragged her agonised way back to the
hidden track.
With a sobbing cough in every breath,
and trailing her wounded leg, she made
her way back to the spot where she had
been parted from Ruddy. Presently, in
response to her low, anxious calls, he
crawled out from a thicket and drank
thirstily from her inflamed udder.
Then, driven by some blind instinct,
Rachel continued along the track.
In the cool of the evening they emerged
suddenly, close to the gate through which
they had entered a bare two days gone ;
but now it was closed.
With a little heartbroken sigh Rachel
collapsed beside it.
One by one dark horsemen debouched
from the bush. A dog ran up to Rachel,
sniffing at her blood-caked shoulder, and
she floundered to her feet, her bloodshot
eyes staring with terror, but she could
not run.
Startled voices called the dog off. He
went reluctantly, and a man came and
stood beside Rachel, staring at her in
puzzled silence.
“John, did you see that cow?” he
asked.
“Saw red!” answered John laconically.
“That was enough for me! Ain’t too
keen on gettin’ close to a mad cow in
that tangle of bush!”
“No more am I,” answered the other
dryly. “But I like to be sure. And this
is Mac’s little pedigree heifer, and there’s
a bullet hole in her shoulder!”
From behind her Ruddy lurched for-
ward with sudden determination, and
began to nose him solemnly.
The Clippers.
When .the clippers came to port
After long, long leagues of sea,
Movirig up past cove and fort
To the Quay-
Gallant rovers, stately rovers,
Of the laughing days of yore.
With their skippers and their sailors.
Salted, tanned by wind and weather—
How we urchins of the Quayside
Watched and waited them together!
As we saw them slowly creep
O’er the harbor’s blue expanse,
Seemed they to us freighted deep
With Romance;
Freighted deep with yarns and chanteys
Sung and told in distant climes;
Freighted, too, with golden ingots,
Silver, gems and fine apparel,
Telling of the wealth and glory
Of far towns, renowned in story.
Lying snug beside the Quay,
Hawsers stout at stern and stem,
Not a moment wasted, we
Boarded them.
Happy urchins, Sydney urchins,
Urchins of the harborside:
Never ships had such a greeting
Homeward come from great adventure —
Laden deep with foreign plunder--
As we gave them, wild with wonder.
Though the tides still ebb and flow
Night and day around the Quay,
While the salty breezes blow
From the sea,
Gone is much that I remember,
On the ebbing tide of time ;
Gone for aye and gone for ever
Are my mates, the Quayside urchins,
And their old-time ships, the clippers,
With their bearded crews and skippers.

Sins of Commission.
BY HAROLD MERCER.
4£TMND a suitable place, and you’re
p on half the commission,” said
* Biggar, with the air of one who
was giving me the world.
Biggar had frequently made me fine,
large offers like that. I was no richer for
them. The search for commission has
small appeal to me ; it is the breath of his
nostrils to Biggar. He can smell commis-
sion in almost anything, even in the
flowers for a funeral, as was shown when
Mrs. Biggar’s uncle died and the
arrangements for his burial fell upon
Biggar. Posing as a stranger who could
influence the family’s custom he levied
tribute on the unsuspecting florist.
“I want a dollar, old chap,” Biggar
went on. “It’s imperative. I’m meeting
Lord Rathermore in half an hour; and
I must have a little loose silver to keep
my en H up.”
“I thought you were doing pretty well
with your dole guide-book,” I said de-
fensively.
“It petered out,” Biggar replied with
his usual roaring laugh ; “and I passed
the whole business over to the printers.
You see, I hadn’t paid them.”
I handed him four shillings. "You’ve
always been a friend,” he said grate-
fully ; “and this is just where I need a bit
of help more than any time in my life.
I’m selling shares in a couple of com-
panies ; but nobody seems to be buying
shares just now. There is a chance of
getting substantial commissions from the
things Lord Rathermore will want; but
I’ve got to keep my end up.”
Biggar had told me all about his meet-
ing with Lord Rathermore. I had not
taken particular notice at the time, but
I recalled'it now. He had wandered into
the Hotel Magnificent in the hope of
running to earth a prospective buyer of
shares in Seaside Sites, Ltd,, and, called
over to a group of friends, had suddenly
been introduced to Lord Rathermore.
His lordship was a likeable fellow;
a globetrotter with a fund of good
stories. Biggar treasured the possession
of the peer’s card with the simple address,
Horder Grange, on it; he treasured even
more the wanderer’s remark that he had
a notion of buying a little place in Syd-
ney, “the most charming city in the
world, my boy!” There was obviously
commission in that.
He had found Rathermore most affable
when he promptly declared that he him-
self could provide the peer with the
fairest house in Sydney ; furniture, too.
“And if you’re thinking of buying a
car ~~ 55
“I should like to see you to-morrow,
Lord Rathermore said. “What about
meeting me here?”
Such was the story on which Biggar se-
cured from me the loose silver I had
vowed half a dozen times never to give
him again. His optimism about the
possibilities of commission overwhelmed
my resolution. ,
“I’ve got time ; what about a drink/
he suggested. As we were standing be-
fore the Hotel Splendid it seemed fair
that he should spend some of my money
on me.
Carruthers, who works on the Mer-
cury,” was standing lonesomely in the
bar. He signalled to. me ; and I intro-
duced Biggar.
“I’m glad to meet you—particularly
glad to meet you,” said Biggar. “On the
‘Mercury,’ eh? How much is it worth
to give you a story about a lord who is
in Sydney now? A couple of quid?”
Carruthers laughed. Biggar seemed
pained to learn that the information
about his lord had no commercial value
to a newspaper.
“It might be worth a ‘stick,’ ” Car-
ruthers said ; “so I’ll buy an extra round
of drinks. But it beats me how this lord
arrived in Sydney without our fellows
who do the boats getting a line about
him.” .
“He’s the sort of chap they might
miss,” Biggar explained. “There’s no
swank about him. He’s interesting, too ;
travelled a lot. Likes to move about
from place to place just like—like an
ordinary man.”
“Sure he is a lord? There was a
pommy who put it over well a couple
of months ago till somebody discovered
that the title he used didn’t exist.”
“That isn’t possible in this case!” pro-
tested Biggar, considerably dashed by
the suggestion.
“We can easily make sure of that,” said
Carruthers. “The office is only a block
away; ‘Debrett’ will give us the infor-
mation.”
“We’ll go and see, if you can spare the
time,” said Biggar. “But I was going to
buy a drink first.”
“Have this with me,” said the manager
of the Splendid, who had been lingering
on the other side of the bar.
“The landlord shouts! ” proclaimed
Biggar. “I say, Payton, I’ll bring Lord
Rathermore over to see you. A fine
chap! Free spender, too. It would be
a good thing for the Splendid if he
stayed here, wouldn’t it?”
“I’d like to meet him,” Payton said,
obviously impressed.
I was sufficiently interested to go with
them to the “Mercury” office. Biggar’s
big laugh showed his relief when “De-
brett” revealed that Lord Rathermore
actually existed, and that there was an
earldom in the family.
“I wish I had this,” Biggar said, point-
ing to the volume. “No chance of bor-
rowing it, is there?”
Carruthers looked round cautiously.
“Tear the leaf out,” he said. “It’s an
old copy, and there’s another somewhere
in the office. Nobody will miss it.”
A breezy half-column in the next day’s
“Mercury” showed that Carruthers had
been impressed by Biggar’s noble friend.
A night or two later I met Mrs. Bigga
surrounded by her flock of little Biggars.
They had just left a picture show, and
Mrs. Biggar’s face was glowing with hap-
piness. The lady’s unshakeable loyalty
to her erratic partner gave me always a
great sympathy for her.
“Have you heard about Tom’s good
fortune?” she asked. “Fancy my Tom
having a friend who’s a real lord! And
a real friend, too! Have you met Lord
Rathermore?” she asked.
“f haven’t actually met him”
“You’ll be delighted when you do.
What a gentleman he is! So easy in his
manners; and not at all stilted. You
know what I mean. When Tom told him
about us he made him bring us all in
and put us into a picture-show.”
“The pictures were fine,” little Billy
Biggar broke in. “There was a lion
tearing a man to pieces!”
“The love picture was the best,” little
Edna said.
“Isn’t it grand that Tom should have
met him? Just when things seemed to
be going wrong again. His lordship
even thinks of young Tom, who’s doing
so well at his work ; and he’s going to
order young Tom a new suit. It looks
as if Tom will get a regular position as
his secretary. It’ll give him a standing;
secretary to a nobleman!”
“At four pounds a week?” I asked
whimsically. In spite of all the grand
terms in which Biggar often spoke of
money, £4 a week remained, with the
lady who clung to him so loyally, the
acme of human happiness.
“That will be splendid, won’t it?” she
said, as if she accepted my jesting sug-
gestion as a fact.
Apparently the secretaryship was only
in the air, yet Mrs. Biggar gave the im-
pression of one from whom financial
worries had been removed. Biggar must
have been very quick off the mark if he
had gathered commissions already.
Biggar blew upon me like the south-
erly buster he usually represented. I
managed to avoid the second thump on
the back; one was enough.
“Come to the Splendid! ” he com-
manded, and, as if moving before a gale.
I found myself half-way to the door.
“Lord Rathermore is staying there; did
you see the par. in this morning’s ‘Mer-
cury’? Payton is as pleased as Punch
about it. It’s a dashed fine ad. for the
Splendid, and a good thing for me.”
“How?” I asked, though I knew what
was coming.
“I’m to get commission on Lord
Rathermore’s bill,” Biggar explained;
“I’ve already tapped Payton for a bit on
account, and he paid up like a toff.
That’s Lord Rathermore’s car,” pausing
on the step to point to a magnificent
vehicle parked before the hotel. “I had
to share the com. on that with Diver, of
Sedan Sales ; he gave me some of it.
There’s more to come.”

“Everything going well?” I queried. I
was beginning to see the reason for Mrs.
Biggar’s happiness.
“Well, I should say it was!” said
Biggar with his roaring laugh. “When
I first brought Rathermore to the hotel
in that car, Payton looked hard at it. I
think I’ve a chance of getting com. on
the sale of a car to Payton. But that’s
merely a side issue. Rathermore —a great
chap!—seems inclined to leave every-
thing to me: house, furniture, every-
thing he wants. He suggested the other
day that he ought to give me a salary ;
but there’s more in commission, old
chap—much more in commission!”
We turned away from the contempla-
tion of the car.

stantial bundle on his own account when
his draft comes from England. Even
a wealthy man, when he goes on a board,
wants his commission ; but it’s worth it
to us.”
He held my arm as we entered the bar.
“There he is, and that’s old Money
Sanders with him. I introduced them
to-day. I’ve been after Money Sanders
for Seaside Sites, but he’s tough as nails.
See if I don’t get him now ! He’s tickled
to death with the idea of sitting on the
board with Lord Rathermore.”
Lord Rathermore I found as affable
and unassuming as Biggar had de-
scribed him. I may have liked him the
more because, when I offered to shout,
he interjected “No! No! I’m the host.”
At his nod the glasses were filled; he
signed a chit for them without glancing
at the amount.
His title seemed nothing to him. It
was Biggar who spoke about it, as he
must have done to Illingworth before he
brought Illingworth into the group.
“Lord Rathermore, this is a friend of
mine, Mr. Illingworth. Illingworth tra-
vels for a wine and spirit firm ; and I
was thinking that when you get that
house—well, you’ll need a cellar.”
“Of course I shall need a cellar. Have
a drink, Mr. Illingworth? If you’re a
friend of Tom’s you’ll get the order, of
course. I leave all that to Tom. He
knows more about Sydney than I do ;
my counsellor and guide, you know.”
As I was leaving Biggar came with
me to the door.
“Do you want that four bob?” he
said. “I’ve just collected ten bob from
Illingworth—advance commission.”
So Biggar had dropped on a good
thing at last. He had apparently
taken complete possession of Lord
Rathermore, and was collecting advance
commissions on purchases for his patron
with surprising success. I happened
to meet young Tom Biggar, whose earn-
ings had at times been the sole financial
resource of the family ; he was resplen-
dent in a new suit. “Lord Rathermore
got it for me at the shop where Dad
opened an account for him,” he proudly
explained.
But I heard something more about
commissions when I met Rabone.
“Hey, when you meet that friend of
yours, Biggar,” he said, “tell him to
bring Lord Rathermore along about that
wireless set.”
What’s wrong?” I asked. From his
manner there was something wrong.
“Biggar collected some commission
from me, and 1 had to borrow it from
the firm. What’s become of this lord?”
“Why not call at the Splendid?” I
suggested.
“I have called. He’s gone. The people
did not seem pleasant.”
I was alarmed. If Rathermore was a
fraud, Biggar, who had got goods and
credit for him everywhere, might be in
trouble. Good enough for people like
Money Sanders —how he had fawned on
the supposed lord!—but I felt sorry for
Biggar, and more sorry for his loyal ladv
and the family.
But Biggar, when I met him, was as
buoyant as ever.
“You'll have one with me, of course."
he began. Then he stood still and gripped
my arm. “I’m going to dive down here,”
he said, indicating a side lane. “Here’s
Bobkins coming, and I don’t want to
meet him. I’ve had some advance com-
mission from him. See you at the Majes-
tic at three.”
He was gone. It was not my first
experience, by any means, of the sudden
vanishment of Biggar when creditors
loomed. It was almost a habit. Bobkins
—whom I did not know—glared at me as
he passed.
A little later I met Rogers, a tolerant
friend of Biggar’s. He told me the
story of Lord Rathermore as of a jest
that I did not know, laughing as he
did it.
“I hope there’s no prosecution,” I said.
Its amazing there isn’t. This oogus
Lord Rathermore”
“But he is Lord Rathermore,” laughed I
Rogers. “ I knew him at the war ; a fine j
soldier he was, too, though he would
swank.”
“In the A.1.F.?” I asked, astonished.
“Yes. He’s Australian, though he’s
seen a good deal of the world since the
war.”
"Then he isn’t Lord Rathermore,” I
said triumphantly.
“He is. He was born in a place called
Horder Grange in Queensland. This
chap’s grandfather, who 1 settled in
Queensland, named his farm after some
place he knew in England. And his
mother probably thought it would be
nice to christen him ‘Lord.’ ”
“Christian name!” I blurted out.
“That’s what it is,” Rogers said,
“and I suppose it accounts for a lot of
the fellow’s swank. But if he were brought
into court nobody could swear that
he made any representation except that
he was Lord Rathermore, of Horder
Grange—which he is. And it’s not worth
while going for Biggar, who acted in
good faith. His commissions are civil
debts, anyway.”
* * * *
Biggar seemed safe, but I was still sorry
for his family. I need not have been.
I found him outside the Majestic with
Mrs. Biggar. She looked quite tranquil.
‘‘Well have that drink —you won't
mind, mother, will you?” Biggar said.
“Seaside Sites are going big since Money
Sanders went on the board. And he
wouldn’t have gone on but for Lord
Rathermore.”
“They’re giving Tom a salary of four
pounds a week,” said J Mrs. Biggar
proudly.
"And commission,” Biggar added.
Java Magic.
BY FENG-SHUI.
1 SAILED from early morning in one of
those weird, spidery-looking djukongs.
The skipper of the craft was one
Min. He had a head as round as a
bullet, deep-sunk eyes, with a twinkle
in them, and big negroid lips which,
when open in a. smile unusually frank
for a Malay, showed a dark gap filled
with perfect teeth, blackened, however,
by betel-nut chewing. His chest glowed
golden-brown and herculean above his
soiled white pants.
Min was immensely delighted to learn
that T was a seaman myself, albeit a
smooth-water yachtsman, and he took
great pains to initiate me into the mys-
teries of djukong-sailing. I took the tiller,
luffed, paid off, jibed—jibing being the
only way of going about known to a
djukong. Presently l learned about the
tali jampang, which is the mainsheet, and
the tali klat and the tali ban, and about
the pengeling, which is the main boom ;
and when I had learnt all there was to
learn I got into trouble with the chelaga
(the tiller), the tali jean pang, the tali baa
and the tali klat flew wide, and the sail
thundered round the mast. 1 was igno-
miniously dismissed from the poop and
sent back to the fo’c’sle.
I was surprised to see how well the
queer little craft held her wind, despite
the two great bamboo outriggers on
each side and the shape of the sail, which
is like a jib hoisted foot upwards. She
slipped along in what seemed a dead
calm in the speediest fashion. It was
fine lying on the little half-deck forrard
hearing the gentle flap-flap of the out-
riggers, and watching Bali peaks slip by
on one side and Merapi and its sisters
stalking more slowly along on the other.
For some hours we crept from one
eddy to another along the coast, making
for some fish-traps which Min wanted
to examine. These fish-traps seemed to
me marvels of industry and ingenuity.
There were miles of them lining the
foreshore, making the sea look like a
suburban subdivision that had been cut
up into allotments, fenced in diverse
manners by their owners and then sub-
merged in some tremendous subsidence.
Some of the traps were composed of
long converging lines of stakes, that
furthest from the set of the tide being
shorter than the other. The fish, meet-
ing this obstacle, make towards the oppo-
site fence and, working their way shore-
wards enter a second enclosure : this,
converging further, forces the shoals
into a still narrower enclosure, until
they are driven into a trap topped by
a platform from which the fishermen
dip them with seines or nets on the ends
of poles. Sometimes a submerged screen

is laid along the bottom and periodically
lifted, bulging with its struggling freight,
composed of a bewildering variety of
fish, edible, inedible, often poisonous and
to be avoided.
Another kind of net forces the fish
into diminishing compartments until
they are in water so shallow that at
low tide they are left gasping on the
black volcanic sand which has framed
the green island of Java ever since the
eruption of Krakatoa.
Min examined several kinds of trap
which were automatic, the stakes being
set inwards so that the fish enter it with-
out suspicion but are frightened when
they attempt to escape; they are then
easily captured by means of a landing
basket. He inspected a small trap whose
door is closed by the fish themselves.
They tug at baits which release a catch,
causing a door of bamboo strips to close
upon them.
Min worked the traps with expert and
practical industry, talking not of fish,
but of the wonders of hunting in the
jungle. The creatures of the jungle, he
said, were not as simple as the denizens
of the ocean. The skill of the huntsman
has to be supplemented by the akal, or
occult knowledge, of the witchdoctor.
In fact, to be a successful hunter one
must be a combination of woodsman and
witchdoctor.
One must know what name to call
an animal. A snake is not a snake, but
a “living creeper.” A tiger has host
of honorific names, from “shah” to
“grandfather.” If you meet its tracks
in the jungle you must cover them with
leaves so that it cannot retrace its foot-
steps.
If you want to catch a deer, you must
first make an image of it out of wax
and then rub a certain juice on the eye-
balls and stuff the nostrils up with clay,
so that your quarry will neither be able
to see you nor smell you coming. If you
hunt with dogs you must stimulate their
zeal by reminding them of their kinship
with the animals they are seeking. A
further inducement is to promise them
marriage with their quarry. Most of
the wild animals have allies in the spirits.
You must subjugate the appropriate
spirit by incantations, and induce it to
enter a bottle, where you feed it with
blood pricked from your thumb ; out of
gratitude for this friendly treatment it
will betray the animal you are after.
Pointing to the forest clothing with
deep indigo the slopes of Badjoel Mati
on the Java side, Min told me of the
were-tigers—really men who have the
faculty of turning themselves into tigers.
When night comes on the tiger-man
leaves his wife’s side and slips into the
jungle. He sheds his clothes, drops on
all fours and, invoking the name of
Allah, makes a leap along the ground.
At the first leap the last joint of his
spinal vertebrae grows into a tail. At
the second his feet and hands become
claws. At the third his skin turns striped
and hairy. At the fourth his head be-
comes the head of the terror of the
forest. At the fifth his voice becomes
a roar and he turns, a tiger, to prey on
the poultry and cattle of his neighbors
in his own village.
In his human aspect the were-tiger is
known by a slight limp of the left Teg,
which he succeeds in concealing except
in moments of excitement; or perhaps
he forgets when he thinks he is unob-
served. At times, when he changes back
to his human shape in a hurry, feathers
or blood are left on his lips. Waking
beside him in the morning, his wife per-
ceives with horror these evidences of
his double nature. With trembling hand
she wipes them from his face —and says
nothing about it.
We beat up against the tide, which
runs through here like a river, making
for Gilimarnok, which is on the Bali
side, where there were more fish-traps.
But you can be quite sure of never get-
ting to the place you are aiming at in a
djukong. The tide was coiling itself into
all sorts of curious and violent whirl-
pools and eddies which swept the boat
about as if it were a cork, so we gave up
the attempt and made for Kampong Pan-
dean, on the Java coast.
The name sounded classical. It was
a little fishing village, some stranded
djukongs, like dry shells of grasshoppers,
straddling on the beach and, behind, a
few grey atap roofs showing amongst
the vivid green undergrowth. Above
them, cocoanut palms, a less brilliant
green, and in the background the great
slopes of Merapi and Rante, rising from
deep-blue foothills to grey, sunlit sum-
mits, the Raoen still further back, its
lava cap shining through a rainy mist
like a coronet of steel.
From the kampong came the sound of
a reedy music—Pandean pipes. A dark-
browed shepherd boy emerged on the
black beach leading two golden-colored
oxen ; on the edge of a brown rushy pool
we found a youth fishing, who fled at our
approach. Then Pan appeared; Pan,
bearing his dinner in a banana leaf-
some rice, curry and a plucked fowl.
“A pa khabar, tuan?” (What news?)
“Khabar baik !” (Good news!) This is
Pa Bakea—truly Pan, though lacking his
pipes.
Min introduces us. Old Pa Bakea is
a noted shikari. Everything tftat goes
on four legs in the jungle he has trapped
and everything that flies he has shot. All
things succumb to his art, but he makes
light of it. He goes into the jungle un-
armed or with a rusty long-barrelled
muzzle-loading weapon which has been
innocuous these forty years; he returns
with some sleek skin or so, and lays it at
your feet. If you ask how he got
it he gives an explanation that is common-
place enough, and he has no objec-
tion to initiating European hunters into
the simple first course—the fringes of the
mystery.
He makes a fine, sturdy, tattered figure
of a man, with his ragged Birmingham
sarong looped round his hips and his
muscular brown legs set solidly apart,
his square, kindly face alive with intelli-
gence and rendered venerable by a tuft
of white beard of which he is inordinately
proud.
Pa Bakea squats at my feet while Min
goes off to inspect one of his river traps
set in the estuary on which Kampong
Pandean stands. He nods after Min’s
retreating figure. There goes a man who
knows something about fish. The deni-
zens of the ocean, it seems, are not to be
as easily caught as the creatures of the
forest. To catch fish a man must know
its asal, its origin, or he will go empty-
handed. Was not the dugong created
from the remains of a pig off which in a
weak moment the Prophet dined? Is not
the sole the half of a fish which Mahomet
threw back into the sea? And there is a
fish with fine white bones which squeals
when you spear it. It is the incarnation
of a cat. And the eel, what is that but
the stem of the long and sinuous gli-gli
plant?
These things the fisherman must know,
and he must know the correct words to
say over a handful of mangrove leaves
that, if flung into the water, will there-
upon turn into a shoal of fish, easily to
be caught in the jala jet. And he must
know how, by poking out the eyes of a
fish, to cause all its mates of the same
species to swim blindly into the kelong
trap.
Pa Bakea tells me many strange things
about the sea. There is the berubur-rubur,
the tiny jellyfish that, creeping through
the cracks in a vessel’s garboard strake,
melts and expands until the vessel sinks.
There is the ikan putch, which was cre-
ated out of the shavings from a boat-
builder’s bench; after seeing the ikan
putch one must preserve continence for
seven days or one’s wife may give birth
to a child which is half-man, half-fish.
He starts to tell me of the hantu sam-
bar, the ghostly crab-fisher of Tanjong, but
suddenly stops. Min is approaching with
a basket of fish on his back. Pa Bakea
drops his voice to an undertone while he
tells me about how the hantu sambar
fishes only on the 15th of the month,
when the night is so dark that you cannot
see anything but his torch, which burns
green, blue and white; how he plucks out
the entrails of any man who disturbs his
sport, leaving him empty like a crab shell
on the beach, for the tide to sweep away.
The sea breeze had come irt strongly,
and we swept swiftly home over the
sparkling strait, our outriggers clip-
ping the waves as lightly as dancers’ heels,
and the great triangular sail swaying
slowly and rhythmically from side to side,
like a Malay dancer dancing from the hips.
Min made a gesture backwards with
his chin. “Did you notice, tuanV ’ he said
gravely. “When Pa Bakea walked up
from the beach, he limped on his left
foot.”
Unforgotten.
We spoke, one glorious night of old,
Of worlds beyond us set,
When sighing seas of pine and gum
Grew calm and hushed and wholly dumb.
Do you remember yet?
You said “The real death has come
When all the loved forget.”
And so my message goes to-day,
From that bright land you knew,
For even in the realms divine
I dream, at times, you wait the sign
That human love is true.
If this be death,' O friend of mine,
There is no death for you.
The scenes that we two loved and knew
Are ever haloed round; . , ‘
The songs you loved can thrill me through,
And waken memories anew
With every magic sound;
The very streets I trod with you
To-day are holy ground.
A voice like yours, a laugh, a word,
Can stab with sudden pain,
And in the street a chance phrase heard
Can make the skies grow dim and blurred,
For I shall wait in vain,
Through all the years, with heart unstirred
By your own voice again.

“Writing to Win”
Bernard Cronin’s
Course
STORY-WRITING,
PARAGRAPHS,
ARTICLES.
The training Bernard Cronin gives
is the most helpful that can be given
because its foundation is the pupil’s
own work, his or her own thought,
expression and presentation.
“FRIENDSHIPS.”
“Friendships” is a little document of
extraordinary human interest. In it
some of Mr. Cronin’s pupils say what
they think of him and why they think
it. Copies of “Friendships” are sent
post free with copies of “Writing to
Win,” also post free, on request.

Welford Pty., Ltd., 398 Flinders
Lane, Melbourne.
Mr. Cronin’s latest novel, “The Sow’s
Ear," is having a remarkable success.
PELMANISM
A Practical Course for
Practical Men and Women
PELMANISM is concerned with personal attributes and quali-
ties, which are fundamental. They may be sleeping or only
partly developed, but they are in every normal individual.
Pelmanism develops them, separately and together, so that amongst
other things concentration is made easier by quickened perceptions ;
natural energy enormously increased by interest, and prompt
decision justified by soundness of judgment.
Amongst these attributes and qualities are:
Concentration
Judgment
Decision
Will-Power
Initiative
Self-Confidence
Presence of Mind
Organising Power
And a Reliable Memory.
The development of these strong, positive, vital qualities contributes
to one’s earning capacity, makes for security, and so makes it
possible to live intelligently and strongly.
The People Who Take the
Pelman Course
There is only one kind of man who takes the Pelman Course,
but he is found in every calling and in every walk of life. He is
the man who wants to excel, who will not be deterred by circum-
stances, who will live intelligently and strongly, the man who will
reach out and take the good things that every age and every
occupation offer to him who has the wit and courage to take them.
AN ACCOUNTANT states that Pel-
manism has shown him “how to
overcome that paralysing feeling
of inferiority.”
A SHOP ASSISTANT reports that
he has secured a better position,
and attributes this to Pelmanism.
A FARM-WORKER writes: “Thanks
to Pelmanism, I am feeling more
confident and more alive.”
A MANAGER reports an increase
in Self-confidence, “which has
brought me the respect of my
colleagues.”
AN ENGINEER writes: “I feel
especially an increase in Self-confi-
dence, which gives professional
status.”
A CLERK writes that he has im-
proved in memory, concentration
and will-power, and that his mind
is quicker and more alert.
A WOMAN CLERK writes: “I can
concentrate for quite a long period
without my mind wandering. I
observe things far more quickly,
and have ever so much more confi-
dence in myself and my abilities.”
A TEACHER writes: “This Course
has had a remarkable effect bn my
physical and mental health. What
pleases me most is the certainty
that ' 1 have lost my fear. My
Self-confidence has returned, and
my whole outlook on life seems
to be reconstructed.”
A BANK CLERK writes: “This
Course has enabled me to see
clearly what I want in life and
how to get it. It has taken me out
of the rut.”
Thousands of similar letters from all
over Australia and New Zealand
could be printed did space permit.
“PEL MAN I S M,”
says D a m e
Sybil Thorndike,
“gives mind-exercise
scientifically. It not
only improves, but
actually discovers,
qualities that would
otherwise have re-
in a i ned dormant.
Pelmanisin gives a
mental clarity and
alertness that sees
opportunities an d
uses them rightly.”
h
Dame Sybil Thorndike.
Lord Riddell.
“Pelmanism,” says
Lord Riddell, “is
rapidly becoming
part and parcel ol'
onr daily lives. - ’
Lord Riddell did
splendid work for
England at tlie
Peace Conference.
His War Diary, just
published, is excit-
ing great interest.
“Pelmanism,” D r.
Norwood, of the
City Temple, Lon-
don, says, “is sound
Psychology and an
admirable system of
Mind-training. Pel
manism teaches that
man has the key to
his own career and
enables many to
find the: key itself
which, for want of
self-knowledge, had
lain undiscovered.”
h
Dr- A'’- VV. Norwood, D.D.
