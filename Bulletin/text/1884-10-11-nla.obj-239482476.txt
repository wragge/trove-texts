Indecent Literature.
The recent seizure of books alleged to be
indecent opens up a curious question, which
in singularly emphasized by the Daily
Telegraph. That journal heads its account
of the affair: “ Seizure of Pernicious Litera-
ture.” Now, there seems little question
that the spirit in which the seizure of the
books was made corresponded exactly with
the aspect in which it struck the uncon-
sciously discriminative Daily Telegraph.
The gist of the proceedings lay in the fact
that the ordinary Police Court Justice was
converted for the time being into a censor
of literature. The charge made by Police-
Inspector Anderson —who is well-known to
be a very strong sectarian—against some of
the, books was not that they wei e merely
indecent, but that they were, as the D.i>
puts it, pernicious. Mr. Anderson, besides
reading detached passages—a method of
demonstration which would equally justify
the conviction of a dealer in Holy Bibles—
alleged that, if the principles of some of the
works were cairied out, “ the present con-
stitution of society would be overthrown.’’
Well, what of that ? The allegation was
quite beside the mark. The present consti-
tution of society is no part of Divine revela-
tion, and to seek to alter or subvert it is no
offence against either law or religion. But
it may be said, the plan suggested in these
books would not improve upon the present
constitution of society. Perhaps not. That
is a matter of opinion. And of a surety
there is no indecency or illegality in pro-
pounding in good faith a philosophical or
social system which fails to penetrate the
iatelleot of a Methodistical Inspector of
Police. “The constitution of society ” has
been overthrown repeatedly, and by every
successive change mankind has been in the
long run the gainer. Among the books
seized were “The Fruits of Philosophy ’’
and “The FJements of Social Science.”
Now, neither of these books is what may be
termed essentially indecent. They both
treat, indeed, of very delicate, or—as some
foul-minded people would, perhaps, prefer
to say —indelicate subjects. But both books
deal with these subjects philosophically, and
one of them treats of them medically, and
in a very competent fashion. We don’t
expect Inspector Anderson to comprehend
our line of argument, of course. But
happily the readers of The Bulletin can
mostly be regarded as having intelligence
adequate to follow abstruse demonstrations.
* * *
Our readers will understand our position
when we show that, while we disagree with
the philosophy of both these books, we con-
sider the punishment of any man for selling
them a piece of infamous stupidity. The
whole matter as regards these two books is
extremely recondite, and hinges upon the
verity or falsity of the Malthusian doctrine
relating to population. The author of “ The
Elements of Social Science” is a pronounced
disciple of Malthus; so also is the author
(Dr, Knowlton, if our memory serve us,)
of the work from which the excerpts pub-
lished separately under the title of “The
i ruitsof Philosophy” aretaken. Theeditors
of the last named book, Mr. Bradlaugii and
Mrs. Besant, are also strong adherents of
the Rev. Mr. Malthus, whose theory, by the
is practically incorporated in the or-
hodox beliefs of the age. Now, that theory
is admitted on all hands, even by its most
evoted adherents, to be an infinitely dis-
ressing one. Although it is endorsed by the
orthodox, and constitutes a vital portion of
the political religion ;of all the propertied
and otherwise fortunate classes, it is a theory
which directly tends to atheism. So strongly
is this the influence of its teachings, in fact,
that it seems but natural that atheists like
Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs.” Besant should
credit it. One might almost conceive that
they owe their atheism to their Malthusian-
ism. But that people who profess to believe
that human affairs are governed by the
direct control of a God, omnipotent, omni-
scient, and, above all, loving, should be able
to reconcile a belief in the teachings of Mal-
thus with their theological faith, is a pro-
found mystery.
Orthodox religion inculcates the theory
that an all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-
loving God created man, controls human
affairs, and regulates existence. The Rev.
Mr. Malthus, a beneficed clergyman of the
Church of England, taught that the con-
ditions of human existence are so discord,
antly arranged that misery is the fore-
ordained and inevitable lot of a large
proportion of mankind. Now, no person
competent to reason logically can believe
both these propositions. But it is the vi#e
of dogmatic theology that it not only dis-
regards logic, but absolutely cripples and
disables theminds of its students for coherent
reasoning. A contradiction of ideas or of
terms, of which the foregoing is an example,
is not, in the theological system of reasoning,
an evidence of essential error. Whenever
the incredible stops the way in dogmatic
theology, it is promptly and adroitly leaped
with the assistance of a miracle, or scram-
bled over with the help of a convenient
present moment crowded by a mass
of, without exception, starveling human
beings is that the strongest—as in the case
of a shipwrecked crew—have snatched the
share of the weakest, and, while .thus pre-
serving their own robustness, have driven
the others to destruction. The simile of a
shipwrecked crew alloat with inadequate
provisions almost exactly illustrates Mr.
Malthus’ argument. The unhappy wretches
are driven by their miserable circumstances
to struggle with each other for existence.
Some, overawed by the habit of obedience
to authority, submit to see their officers ap-
propriate to themselves the garments requi-
site for protection from the inclemency of
the weather and the food necessary for the
sustentation of life. These docile victims
languish and die. Others, less tractable, fly
ladder called Faith. By this plan it becomes
possible to theologically trained people>
who have not independently worked out
the emancipation of their own minds,
to believe that contradictory propositions
may both be correct, and that a statement
may, at the same time, involve an impos-
sibility and embody a Divine truth. The
capacity for believing equally two irrecon-
cilable propositions is one definite result of
a theological training—a system generally,
butquiteimproperly, designated “religious”
teaching.
♦ • •
The theory of Malthus is that population
naturally tends to increase more rapidly
than the means of subsistence. Accord-
ing to the reverend economist, the only
reason why the world is not at the
at the throats of the monopolists, and fight
them at any disadvantage — desperately
ready to sacrifice their own lives, provided
they can drag one of their selfish antagonists
overboard with them. The stronger party,
on the other hand, aware that, owing to the
insufficiency of supplies, all must perish if
some are not sacrificed, quiet their con-
sciences with the argument of necessity,
seize upon all the provisions they can secure,
and, hardening their hearts, throw the re-
sponsibility upon Providence ; arguing that
the fact that they are strong and armed, and
the others weak and weaponless, is ample evi-
dence that the Almighty designed that they
should live and the others die. Sometimes one
more callous, more cunning, or more devout
than ordinary, recognising early that a
struggle is inevitable, schemes to precipitate
it, and incites one party of the less knowing
to engage in a destructive conflict with an-
other party of the same sort. So, in like
manner, Malthus teaches that sufficient
food for comfortable subsistence is only re-
served to the few by the destruction of the
many. Population would, he alleges, have
long ago exceeded the means of subsistence,
and the human race would have been ex-
tinguished by universal famine, but for the
operation of certain checks to increase, and
certain processes which operate to sweep
away human superfluity. These checks he
defines as all those customs and all those
diseases which seem to be generated by a
scarcity of the means of subsistence. First,
the preventive check, which includes in
various forms all processes or considerations
which induce human beings to abstain from
reproduction. Mr. Malthus, under this
head, distinctly reviews the effects of prosti-
tution, but dismisses that as immoral, and
founds his entire proposals of remedy upon
an abstinence from wedlock, or, at least,
fronp procreation, to be observed.’in obedi-
ence to moral obligations. But the vice of
his system is that he recommends that this
abstinence from the joys of matrimony and
the delights of paternity shall be imposed
solely upon those classes of individuals
whose circumstances are most narrow. In
other words, he advises that when a man
has been denied the ease, dignity, and con,
sideration which wealth bestows, and when
he has already to suffer from straitened
circumstances and small|regard, he shall put
the climax upon his ill-fortune by passing
through existence in a condition of celibacy,
never to know the sweet delight of having a
child of his own smile upon him. These
joys, Mr. Malthus proposes, should be re
served as an addition to the pleasures of the
well-to-do. It is easy to understand that the
theories of MALTHUshave been most heartily
endorsed and approved in the most distin-
guished and respectable quarters. Failing
observance of the preventive checks, Mal-
thus warns mankind to expect the positive
checks. These comprise misery in every
form; war, pestilence, and famine, against
which the English clergy pray every Sunday ■
but which, according to Malthus, are Pro-
videntially ordained so [long as poor people
are not restrained, either by moral consider-
ations or by other force, from mating.
• • •
Malthus, as a priest, regards all connec-
tions not sanctified by the sacrament of
marriage as vicious; and while he recognises
promiscuous intercourse and prostitution as
being potently effectual checks to popula-
tion, and therefore in a sense useful to the
human race, he dismisses them as inadmis-
sable on moral grounds. His disciple, the
author of “ The Elements of Social Science,”
parts company with him at that point, and
contends that in view of the frightful doom
of the human race if procreation be general,
and of the absolute impracticability of re* i
straining mankind from indulging m the
most overwhelmingly potent of all natural
instincts, prostitution is, although a deplor-

In “The Fruits of Philosophy,” the
Authors, whose vieWs have been adopted by
thinkers of the Biiadl,auoh and Besant
School, While admitting the accuracy of Mr.
Malthds’ diagnosis of the fate of humanity,
spurn the suggestion that prostitution is ex
cusable, and recommend what may be
termed restricted procreation in wedlock.
They argue that any form of prevention,
not physically injurious, is better than that
myriads of the world's population should
only come into existence to languish in un-
speakable misery, to die of premature de-
lay for lack of sustenance, or violently in
wars and convulsions due to the constant
struggle for the survival of the Attest. In
simple language, they explain to their fei-
low creatures a means of limiting popu-
lation.
• • *
Thus, it will be recognised, it is a far-
reaching philosophy, not an ebullition of
filth for filth’s sake, that Inspector Ander-
son and the Sydney Bench have in their
superior wisdom ruled shall not be revolved
by the people of this colony at any rate. It
is nothing to them that “The Elements of
Social Science ” has already passed through
a dozen editions, has been translated into
both German and French, and may be found
in the library of probably nine out of ten
studious meu all over the world. There is
really nothing marvellous in this superior
sagacity on the part of a policeman, when
we consider that in the time of the Common-
wealth sundry inspired cobblers, butchers,
and brewers, would fain have suppressed
every copy of the works of Shakespeare;
and that when the Pope was a temporal
sovereign, any earnest mouchard in his
dominions would have felt it incumbent on
his conscience, and found himself supported
by legal authority, in seizing every copy he
could lay his hands upon of “ The Pilgrim’s
Progress,” or the works of Sir Isaac New-
ton.
* * *
It is about time that the laws with respect
to indecent publications were placed upon
an intelligible basis. Of the works seized by
Inspector Anderson, two, as we have shown,
are philosophical treatises, written with
serious objects, and really valuable as mate-
rials for very important reflections. We
disagree with the systems of both, utterly
and entirely. We challenge the accuracy of
the theories upon which both base their de-
ductions. That is to say, we dispute the
accuracy of Maethus’ system. But we re-
cognise the harm fldes of the authors, while
we differ from them, and we admit that no
Malthusian can reasonably complain of
these deductions or can hope to controvert
them. Amongst the other books seized we
observe that extraordinary creation of M.
Zola, “ Nana.” This work, the precursor of
a school of fiction—the realistic—is a work of
absolute genius. It presents no spurious
concoction of impossible immorality, but
pictures aspects of actual life which it is
probably useful should he reco.nistd and
fairly faced. “Nana” has been read all
oVer the civilised world, and is freely sold in
every part of the globe, except the Russian
Empire, Sydney, New South Wales. In
Russia, by a decree of the 5th January of
this year, the following works are not to be
allowed in the reading rooms and public
libraries, viz., translations of works by
Agassis, Bagehot, Huxley, Zola, Lassalle,
Lubbock, Lecky, Louis Blanc, Lewes, Lyall,
Marx, J. 3. Mill, Reclus, Adam Smith’s
“ Wealth of Nations,” and “ Theory of
Moral Sentiments,” and Herbert Spencer’s
works. * If in Moscow there were an In-
spector Andersonofe of orthodox tastes
wider scope for indulgence in these, under
cover of legal sanction and the approval of
“all right thinking people,” would be his
than is enjoyed by our own ToRguEMADA
lu blue But neither Germany, Great
Britain, France, Italy, nor America en_
joys the benefits of having an Inspector
Anderson to treat their population as chil-
dren required to be docile in presence of his
magnificent discrimination in literary mat-
ters. None of the works seized are proper
reading virglnihus puerUsque— words which,
we presume, Inspector Anderson’s vast eru-
dition will enable him to understand convey
no aspersion on his moral character, how-
ever indecent they may look in print. We
have no desire to asperse the active and in-
telligent Inspector by describing him as an
oblate spheroid or a regular parallelopipe-
don. There seems little doubt that the
treatises he seized as being beyond his com
prehension, were in very bad hands and in
very bad company, and that they were be-
ing purchased by persons who, like himself,
comprehended nothing in them except tfce
passages susceptible of being perverted to
pruriency. We have not any knowledge of
“ Paris by Gaslight,” “ Dark Deeds Un-
ravelled,” or “The Disclosures of a Barris-
ter,” but we daresay they were very proper
for seizure, and quite in keeping with
Ovid’s “Art of Love,” “Maria Monk”—a
work highly esteemed in Wesleyan circles—
“The Decameron” of Bocaccio, the Me-
moirs of the Count de Qrammoxt, and the
“ Heptameron ” of Queen Margaret of
Anjou, cr the works of Rabelais— a
seizure of copies of which last-mentioned
four might probably be accomplished were
the zealous Inspector to make a descent
upon Government House or the residence
of any of their Honors the Judges of the
Supreme Court. The plain fact is that the
height of absurdity is arrived at in placing
the grown men of the community under
the literary censorship of a pious peeler.
There are literary treatises which, like
strong waters, should not be sold to chil-
dren. And if a censorship of books be
needed, common sense demands that some
person of competent knowledge should dis-
charge the functions.
♦ N u —We suggest that this list will be con-
venient for committees of schools of arts and

tion in Russia of the works named, distinctly

thing effective towards the emancipation ot man-
kind and the dissemination of progressive ideas.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Champion of Truth.
A conference has recently been held in Sydney
by persons claiming' to represent the Secularists of
Australia. We have not read the reports of their
proceedings with any care, but we are disposed,
apart from any considerations based upon the
quality of the utterances at the meetings in ques-
tion, to agree with the Rev. Mr. Jeffekis that
these meetings did not represent the strength of
Secularism in Australia. The strength of Secular-
ism or of Freethought in Australia has, we believe,
a personnel quite distmct from, and infinitely more
numerous than the few thousands who crowded
the meetings under the leadership of Mr. Joseph
Symes. The majority of Freethinkers are cool and
philosophical persona, who act upon their favour-
ite motto that “ truth is great and must prevail,”
and hold aloof from agitationsand demonstrations.
The churches are full of Freethinkers, who pay
their pew-rents, and, at least, send their women
foil s and children—content with the national pro-
gress of liberal thought, and comfortable in the
conviction that the teachings of Dogmatism aro
rendered innocuous by the overwhelming iniluence
of the spirit of the age. The philosophic Freethinker
when asked whether he is not concerned lest his
youngsters should be indoctrinated with dogma,
and suffer injury to their powers of reasoning by
being dosed with miraculous stories—such as
those about Jonah and the whale, and the she-
bears which gobbled up ancient larrikins-opines
that he can afford to smile at the question. For
every ten men who care to disturb their social
connections by announcing their divergence from
ideas and systems, tacit compliance with which
yields still many advantages, there aro hundreds
who shrug their shoulders, and ask what’s the use
of fussing ? The leaven is working. No one is so
ignorant of the real condition of the public faith
as clergymen, who occupy, in this respect, a posi-
tion analogous to (hat of a cuckold husband. For
our own part, wo like “the other side” to be
heard on all questions—political, religious, and
social—and, as the Secularists have had a consider-
able space allotted to their views lately in the
daily Press, we can't do better than select the most
striking and powerful passages from the best de-
liverance ofi the most pronounced of their critics,
for the information of readers. We select the dis-
course of the Rev. John Osborne for this distinc-
tion, and would willingly give the reasoning of
his sermon of Sunday last. Dut after reading
carefully the synopsis of his discourse as for-
warded (probably by himself) to the daily
newspaper to which '.he is attached, we observe
that the rev. gentleman has preferred—no doubt
for reasons satisfactory to himself—strength of
language to strength of argument. It will be but
just, therefore, to draw upon the department In
which his best strength seems to lie, and to give a
series of his most trenchant points. Thus we find
that Mr. Osborne remarked that—
“Just as the political term ‘sansculotte’ under-
went a terrible transformation, and from being an
honourable though an unfashionable designation
became a synonym for ignorance and Infamy, so
it was with the term secularism.”
Then, with regard to the lectures of that opposi-
tion professional, Mr. Syme, the rev, gentleman
states that
“As an intellectual performance, each lecture was
an Insult to human intelligence, and a travestie on
the art of reasoning. No one but a hopeless fool
would, in these days, dogmatise on the inrerut-
ablo mystery of the origin and ultimate issue of
life. . . . The lecture on heaven was a tirade of
vulgar abuse; and the lecture on secularism was
an undigested mass of stupid dogmatism. . . The
rubbish that wss uttered was in keeping with the
general performances of the secularist platform.
... It was the apotheosis ot tlunkeyism, and
stupidity, and charlatanism, and the performance
stamped secularism as a religion of ignorance.
But the system was also the religion of malice.
There was, probably, not another system in the
world that was more vindictive, and its existence
was almost an d priori proof of the existence of
the devil.”
Next:—
“ The literature of the sect was another proof.
The ephemeral publication?of the secularists were
a disgrace to our civilisation, not chielly for their
suggestions of the grossest impurities, although
they were a prominent feature, but for the devilry
and malignant hatred of mankind with which they
were charged.”
Then Mr. Osborne asked his congregation:—
“ Did they not know very well that if thosecular-
ists got the upper hand in Australia they would
repeat in this lair laud the horrors and crimes that
wore enacted during the Reign of Terror ? ”
He went onto inform them that
“The antiquity of secularism was very great
. . . and it attained its full development in the
old world in Sodom and Gomorrah.”
Also that
“A prostitute for a goddess represented the eter-
nal fitness of things so far as secularism whs con-
cerned. It is a religion of filth and infamy.”
What we admire about these utterances is their
dispassionate and philosophical calmness, and the
fine elevation of morale which they evince. No-
thing can be nobler, for example, than Mr. Os-
borne's denunciation of “a tirade of vulgar
abuse,” and nothing could be more effective than
the contrast afforded by the repose and cour-
tesy of his own style, as illustrated by the above
quotations, which constitute about one-fifth of his
address as published In his paper. We regardjthese
deliverances as bold, and elevated, and powerful;
or, in other words, we may put it that they are as
high and strong as game.
Bees and Wasps.—Roney and Sulphur.
We read that “at the parish church of Stovr-
xnouth, Kent, a swarm of bees some time ago
romantically settled in the roof of the chancel.
This came to the knowledge of the Vicar, but he
would never allow the sanctity of the bees' retreat
to be disturbed, and so they were left alone, no
idea being formed as to the extent of the hive.
Recently, however, the Vicar died, the church
underwent repairs, and the bees, no longer
destined to remain in possession of their quarters;
were destroyed by .fumigation. On the honey
being taken, there was found to be nearly two
hundredweight of it, and the bees filled two
moderately large barrels. It is stated that during
hot weather the honey used to drop down into the
church.” No wonder. The bees, in gratitude,
still further sweetened the words of peace which
Tell from the faltering tongue of the kind old
clergyman. The swarm, we believe, was the same
which fed our ancient friend ’Peter CampbeIjO,
when he dieted on locusts and wild honey and
preached the Gospel in the Barcoo and Tambo
wilderness. And, by the way, were this bee-story
not given as a fact, we should have read it as a
parable. In some churches not far from Sydney
swarms, not of bees, but of clerical wasps, build
their nests, and scorpions crawl along the floor.
And when, in the Stourmouth case, the peaceful
Vicar died, and the old order gave place unto the
new, the ascending sulphur-fumes which killed
the bees and robbed the congregation of the de-
scending honey, may possibly have typified that
hate of the professors of alien faiths and that wor-
ship of respectability and love of luxurious
material comfort which, In this nineteenth cen-
tury, characterise too many of the clergy, and
renders our so-called Christianity a mere carica-
ture of the grand religion founded by the Man
who had no place in which to lay his head.
Civilising the Nigger.
The other day there came before the House of
Commons a paper referring in an incidental kind
of way to the complaints made in reference to the
treatment of aboriginals at Rottnest Prison,
Western Australia. It seems from the British
Parliamentary reports that this trifling affair has
been cleared up to the complete satisfaction of
the colonial officials; that there have been a few
slight informalities and small irregularities—but
that the matter has been “ duly seen to,” and that
—ah, yes, aw—His Excellency the Governor of
W.A. will shortly be in London and will have a
quiet chat with the Secretary of State for
the Colonies. From all this, one would think that
Rottnest Prison had not for years past been a hell
upon earth—that the wretched aborigines en-
tombed therein had not been dying all the time
like fluky sheep—that they had not rotted in
chains of fever generated by filth and overcrowd-
ing and bad food. And for what offences ? Killing
a sheep or a bullock on land of which they had
been deprived by the whites, or trying to kill a
white man who had outraged their women. Let
no one Imagine for an instant that In Western
Australia a blackfellow who had killed a white,
under whatever provocation, was ever allowed to
go unhung if he could be caught. How often
have we read in the S.M. Herald a telegram
something like this The Sheriff and his assist-
ants to-day proceeded to , to prepare for the
execution of Jacket and Tommy, who are to be
hanged on the 20th instant for murdering a stock-
man in the employ of Mr. Broavn, J.P., of Jones’
Plains Station ?” If the blacks of Western Aus-
tralia are human beings and have souls, then
those who are responsible for the treatment they
have received are murderers as base and brutal as
any who ever were throttled by the hangman.
The history of the Black-hole of Calcutta, in which
a few whites were smothered by a blood-thirsty
and tyrannical Indian despot, is written in let-
ters of blood, and known to every school-boy.
But what English schoolboy knows of the hideous
cruelties which in the name of law and of justice
have in modern days been wreaked on the unhappy
natives of Western Australia and Queensland ?
We don’t say anything about those of N.S.W. and
Victoria. They have gone down to the pit. The
following will suffice to show the iniquities which
can be perpetrated under the British flag by
irresponsible officials of Crown colonies. In 1881
certain Forest laws were ” ordained” in Mauritius,
and at once became a means of inflicting great
injustice on the Indian population. Governor
Hennessy states that he found that an Indian for
having in his possession a piece of brushwood a
few inches long, which he used as a toothpick, had
been fined 50 rupees, or ten days’ imprisonment.
This was far from being an isolated case. The
word “tree” in the ordinance was so defined tnat
the possession of a single twig involved an Indian
in a fine of 50 rupees; and in one instance cumula-
tive penalties amounting to 1000 rupees—with the
alternative of two hundred days’ imprisonment—
were imposed upon an Indian who had about him
a small bundle of twigs, not worth a shilling.
“I found,” Sir John Pope Hennessy says, “that
this legislation had come upon the Indian popula-
tion like a sort of social hurricane, breaking up
homes and families, and sending men, women, and
children to prison who had been well-conducted
and industrious.” In the year 1882 the aggregate
lines inflicted for offences of this nature amounted
to 108,544 rupees, and the amount of imprisonment
served in lieu of the unpaid fines was 21,741 days.
Hell can only have been invented for the authors
of cruelties such as this. The missionary and Jack
Ketch often keep step well under the “ flag that’s
braved,” &c.
Mr. Stuart’s Illness.
We believe that the tidings of Mr. Stuart's severe
illness will be received with genuine concern
throughout the colony. Up to the present time,
the manner in which the hon. gentleman has con-
ducted the affairs of the country has been,
although not illuminated by the flashy sensation-
alism of some of his predecessors, straightforward
and conscientious, Mr. Stuart, as Premier, has
already done much to rehabilitate the confidence

(“Plain English,” continued from page 4,)
of colonists in their system of Government,
which had, in perhaps abler hands than his,
begun to stink in the nostrils of the public, as a
system from which constantly emanated an odour
of corruption. During all the period of Mr.
Stuart's Premiership, up to the present time, his
integrity of purpose has never bten suspected;
his name has never, even in vulgar rumour, been
connected with allegations of self-seeking or
trafficking. The public seem to have been breath-
ing more freely than at some other periods, when
the air was heavy and oppressive with first one
political scandal and then another. We trust Mr.
Stuart will speedily recover his health suffi-
ciently to resume his public functions, and we
believe that this wish will be re-echoed through-
out the colony. We have constantly criticised the
course of his administration without favour or
reserve, and we ask nothing better than the oppor-
tunity of continuing to offer criticisms on details,
while being able, broadly speaking, to concede
respect.
Eight Hours.
n his speech at the banquet in connection with
0 ei 8ht hours’ demonstration, the Colonial Trea-
surer dwelt with obvious appreciation upon the
act that eiaht hours is far short of the ordinary
one devoted to labour by men who make their
Wa y in their world; and he instanced, with ap-
proving emphasis, one person in this colony who
“ had had the highest honours bestowed upon him,
and had been the guest of Royalty in England,
and yet had started as a working man, toiling for
twelve hours dally till the blood shot from .his
fingers.” It is quite usual for such examples tube
held up before working men as exemplars of what
they should strive to be. But we hold that the sug-
gested principle is essentially vicious. Mr, Came-
ron hit the nail on one of its heads when he re-
marked that if a man worked an unlimited number
of hours for mere greed, he was not so admirable
after all. A nice world this would be were all
working men to strain every nerve to see who
could by working longest get ahead of his fellows I
Life would be absolutely unendurable, and intel-
lectual progress would come to a full stop as
regards the labouring classes. There is too much
deference paid to ancient and fraudulent ideas
that the grasping drudge or greedily ambitious man
is the estimable one, and that thrift and abstinence
leading to the accumulation of capital are among
the cardinal virtues. AVe, for our part, believe
that moderation is beat in these, as in most other
things, and that what the average man is capable
of in the way of cheerful exertion is the quantity
which should be exerted to secure the maximum
of comfort and happiness throughout society. As
Mr. W. H. P. Campbeud writes, abstinence and
frugality may just as well be a vice as a virtue
when carried to excess. “It may spring not only
from virtuous self-denial and restraint, and a
desire to live frugally and simply, but also from
rapacity and cunning.” Plenty of Mr. Dibbs’s
hearers knew that this is true, and that the strenu-
ous worker and narrowly thrifty workman is not
generally Impelled by virtuous unselfishness, but
often develops into the grinding master and osten-
tatious parvenu— too proud to remember his old
associates, but not too proud to fawn or cringe in
pursuit of what are ridiculously termed “ the
highest honours.” AVe assert that no human being
can confer honour on another. Honour is a virtue.
Even a monarch can no more confer honour upon
a grasping Gbadcjrind than he could confer virtue
upon a retired courtezan.
Jack on the Bench.
The sudden apparition of John Davies, C.M.G.,
J.P , on the Bench at Campbelltown, charged ap-
parently with the mission of “taking no part in
the proceedings ” instituted by Sir Henby Parkes
against Mr. Webb, of the local paper, for alleged
libel, was almost as phenomenal and unexpected
as though the Kiama Ghost in person had ascended
the judgment-seat, and thrown the weird terror of
its countenance upon the magistrates who did
take an active part in the proceedings.
On the Bench, on that occasion, Mr. Davies
much resembled the proverbial fly in amber,
so far as the exciting curiosity as to how he got
there is concerned, although there will be little
doubt as to why he popped up. Considering, also,
that Mr. Webb was known to be a probable can-
didate for the constituency, in an antl-Parkbs-
Davies-Kidman sense, at the first opportunity—if
the Mr. Kidman who helped Mr. Davies to "take
no part in the proceedings ” be identical with Mr
Kidman, member for the electorate, it certainly
appears that decency would have been better
observed by his absence.
Sib Henry Parkes has opened his mind to the
inhabitants of Cudal, a village which is said to be
somewhere towards the Western border of the
colony. Tenterfleld is on the Northern boundary.
Sir Henry's habit of going to extremes, and
dodging out of the way of the main centres of
population, is very significant. He has of late so
much favoured the outskirts of civilisation, that
it would be appropriate to consider him one of the
colony’s hangers-on.

General Brine safely crossed the Channel

Several young ladies in Sydney will be de-
lighted to hoar that Prince George of Wales took
almost the highest marks ever yet awarded to a
midshioman passing for acting sub-lieutenant—
viz., 975 out of 1000. A home paper “wishes his
examining officers had given i im the remaining
25, and then everyone would have had the proud
satisfaction < f thinking that our young sailor
Prince has a perfect repertoire of knowledge i
nautical matters. Seriously, Prince George is a
bright, clever boy, with abilities neither much
above nor below the average, and no little sur-
prise and amusement have been caused in the ser-
vice generally at the action of his examining offi-
cers in awarding him almost full marks.”
Parkes, like the girl in the story whose
idiotic fringe hung over her forehead, is, when he
is good, oh! so very good; but when he is bad. ho

ally) when he pointed out Stuart’s departure from
the right and proper course in allowing a private
member on a Government day to submit a motion
for the expenditure of public money on an im-
portant matter, and then getting one of his col-
leagues to move an amendment. Stuart might say
that his error, b g as it was, wasn’t quite so big as
expending money on an important matter without
gettir.g the House’s consent to it either by a normal
or an abnormal course—tests; those statues, and
the Governor’s country house, &c. Yes: Parkes
can also be horrid.
Information has reached Liverpool (Eng.),
of the discovery in the bush at Lagos, West Africa,
of twelve skeletons, mostly of persons who had
mysteriously disappeared. Several were the re-
mains of the wives of leading- merchants. In
Australia and other properly civilised places, when
the wife of a leading- merchant mysteriously dis-
appears, he carefully keeps her skeleton in the
family cupboard. Tom Haughton, mining en-
gineer, late of Charters Towers, Queensland, has
just returned to London from West Africa, where
he had for several months been looking after cer-
tain alleged gold mines. Tom tells some wondrous
tales of Tong-burled cities, and corpses interred in
coffins holding countless thousands in gold. Ho
promises that he will give us his yarn in full.
There is a singular character going about
the country districts on a temperance tour. His
name is Willie Steel, and he is Scotch, but honest.
He travels from town to town wheeling his
worldly goods in a barrow—which, as we have seen
him, wo consider ostentatious, as he might very
well carry them in the toe of his boot. He wears a
plaid tunic with red and blue facings—a fancy of
his own, symbolising in some mysterious way to
him purity of purpose, we suppose. He sings
Scotch songs of a devotional and improving
character in a fiendish falsetto that fills the heart
of the hearor with ferocity and gloom. His ad vent
in a town is the signal for every adult citizen to
get dangerously drunk and smite his family with
the fire-shovel Willie Steel is, therefore, a very
popular personage among the publicans.
Layoock, who killed his wife and four
children at Sheffield by almost cutting their heads
off, has been sentenced to death. A surgeon who
hud attended prisoner said he considered Laycock
was, at the time, not in his right mind. It was
shown that prisoner's father and two brothers had
committed suicide; so, should he be executed, the
act of the Government will be on a level with
that of the N.S.W, Ministry when it ordered the
execution of the monomaniac, O’Farrell, who shot
at H.tt.H. the Duke of Edinburgh. Six of
O’Earrell’s near relatives are in lunatic asylums or
have suicided. Hy the way, how about the Kiama
Ghost now, and what is the name of the swell
Sydney club which refused to admit within its
sacred precincts the late Mr. Butler Cole Aspinall,
Q.C., because he was about to defend the miser-
able lunatic who shot at Prince Allred ?
Lots of good stories are told about Bobby
Byrue, of Queensland Punch, and among them
is one to the effect that, once upon a time, when
he wished, out of pure cussedness, to further
excite the demon of Jealousy within the breast of
a numbskull who had a pr ;tty actress for a wife,
he went with the unhappy husband to tho theatre
where the lady was playing. During the third act,
where the lover had to talk confidentially to the
lady, Bobby viciously dug his friend in the ribs
with his thumb, and exclaimed: “Look, old man 1
See there! That d — scoundrel of a is putting
his arm round your wile’s waisti Look at that
just! He’s squeezing her! His infernal impu-
dence! It’s not in the i erformance, 1 assure you.
See—here’s the book of the play.’’ And, as Bobby
had carefully posted on the other side of the hus-
band a fellow who. whenever the stage lover went
near the "missis’’ of the gentleman in the pit,
raised his eyebrows, and said, “Tut! Tut!! Dear
me! Dearmel! Humph!” they soon had worked
the actress’ husband into a condition of absolute
lunacy.
The “ moon-faced bookmaker,” Alfred
Joseph, has again been elected to a seat in the
Sandhurst City Council. He had a close run, but
was carried in triumphant on a tide of whisky. He
has long regarded himself as a worthy candidate
for the Mayoral chair, and to attain that exalted
post has gone to no end of trouble and expense.
But a canvass of his colleagues revealed the un-
welcome fact that they drew the line at book-
makers. They made no pretence to fastidiousness,
but the picture of Alfred one day on the judicial
bench and the next in the paddock at Flemington,
bawling “Three to one bar one,” was too much
glory even for them. The ambitious Alfred, there-
fore, to avoid the publicity of defeat, wrote to the
Town Clerk to the effect that if he (Alfred) were
appointed Mayor, he would be reluctantly com-
pelled at present to decline the honour. Why, we
should say so. What a pretty dilemma he would
be in if he were appointed, and half-a-dozen
Welsherswere brought before him for sentence!
Of course, he would have to convict them; but
how would it paralyse the Court if one of them,
after receiving sentence, were to turn round and
say to him, “All right, Alfred; wait till we see
you a headin’ of ’em again -we’ll put you away.”
Mr. J. P. Quirk, of Melbourne, writes to
the Standard that at Belfast, travelling with his
wife and sister, he was accosted on the wharf by a
policeman, who asked him “ Whether that was his
luggage ?” On being informed that it was, the
constable enquired where the traveller came from.
Mr. Quirk replied, “ From Australia;” and, having
further told “Robert.” in answer to a question as
to his business, that he had no business, and was
travelling for pleasure, it was intimated to him
that the portmanteaus would have to be opened.
“ While this conversation was taking place,” writes
Mr. Quirk (who, by the way, is a brother-in-law of
the eminent Doctor “ Pat.” Molony, of literary and
convivial celebrity), “a crowd of about fifty idlers
congregated about us, who evidently looked upon
me as a blood-thirsty Fenian or a returned in-
former, After turning the contents of my port-
manteaus out, and finding nothing that looked
suspicious but a bottle of hair-wash in a wooden
case, which the policeman opened very gingerly,
he wished me ‘ good day,’ and left me to pack and
strap up my things again. What I wish to point
out is—Would it not be better for intending tour-
ists to Ireland to obtain passports, which would, I
have no doubt, prevent them from going through
similar experiences ?” We contend that the police-
man was perfectly justified in regarding with much
suspicion Mr. Quirk’s “bottle of hair-wash,” as
such things often point to the proprietor thereof
as a person who has reasonable fears that he will
one day be abald-headed man. “ Hair-wash,” too,
is often a mere euphuism for hair-dye, and we are
sure that the people of this great Continent would
strongly approve of any Australian who carried
hair-dye being delivered into the hands of Justice.
Lily Evans alias “ The Liliputiau Wonder,”
said to be “ the smallest midget in the world,” has
died suddenly at Birmingham (Eng.), death being
attributed to excessive fatigue caused by numer-
ous “ performances.” The child, who weighed a
pound and a quarter, was only 9 inches in length,
the body, however, being perfectly formed. The
parents, who had previously had several healthy
full-grown children, hired out the “ Lillputian” for
30s. a week to a “showman of monstrosities,” who
exhibited it at a hall. The “ levees” commenced at
9 a.m. and continued until midnight, the midget
being shown to the audience several times an hour
by the wife of the showman, who would “challenge
the world to find so diminutive a midget, and for-
feit £100 if beaten.” The child had been born pre-
maturely. At the Inquest it transpired that the
wretched infant had been kept awake for exhibi-
tion purposes: that it had in attendance on it a
woman who—O tawdriness, what crimes are com-
mitted in thy name!—was engaged by the show-
man as dressmaker and attendant on the midget,
and had to make a new dress, silk, satin, and
coloured, every day for the child; that the mid-
get’s mother was drunk nearly all the time, “ as
she received a lot of money from the showman;’
and that when the mother was drunk the child was
fed on “ scalded biscuits.” In reply to the coroner
the mother said she intended to bury the body,
because she was now told it was “ too far gone;”
she spoke to the showman about it, who said she
could got £30 for the body: she would have sold it
if she taought she was alio wed to do so, but did not
understand the law. The coroner remarked that
the case was an extraordinary one: the mother,
not satisfied with killing the child, was anxious to
make money out of the dead body. The jury re-
turned a verdict equivalent to manslaughter.
As we pass through the wilderness of this

Some of them feared Apollyon who straddled
across the way, and had hoped that utter destruc-
tion might not be their lot. But the Bev. Tarring-
ton, who might bo mistaken for an angel of light,
except that he wears a black waistcoat buttoned
at the back to give fair play to bis four little meals
in front, has been proving concerning the Athana-
sian Creed “ that the damnatory clauses were fully
warranted by Scripture, and stated that he never
had any difficulty in accepting the Creed in its
entirety.” And the pilgrims are in the Slough of
Despond. He followed up the lecture by preaching
last Sunday on the Scriptural beauty of everlasting
punishment. For the benefit of our readers who
have forgotten (and most of them have) what the
Athanasian Creed is, we may state that it is an
affirmation that whoever does not believe what
some unknown and crack-brained dervish of a
thousand years ago maundered about, will, without
doubt, perish everlastingly. And the Bev. Far-
rington had “ never any difficulty in accepting
that creed in its entirety.” Should think not. Nor
a cure of souls that are incurable. His cure is a
blister, it seems. Never heard before of a blister
tor burns.—

Captain Armstrong may now haul down
his little flag for ever. His case has been taken up
by the Distress. And this reminds us, that the
journal in question is very angry with us, Indeed,
and lays for us in true holy fashion. When Mr. J.
G. O’Connor announced his “new departure”
(which appears to consist chiefly of a green cover
and a sporting [! I article), we wrote, as is our
cheerful wont, a mild little congratulatory par.,
in return for which we certainly expected to re-
ceive, instead of a vial of wrath, a quart bottle of
“cold-drawn ” holy water. The Distress, however,
treats us unkindly, and calls us The Bully tin,
and other cruel names, and crushes us finally with
the following indignant retort“ If Mr. J. G.
O’Connor wished to stop the publication of Sydnoy
Punch that was his business, and he knows his
own business best.” Of course he does, bless him I
In our par. we said that Punch was “brilliantly
successful,” and now (for the iron has entered mir
soul) we are willing to admit that J. G. squelched
that screaming publication in (as they say in the
playbills) “the highest tide of its success." The
reason for this was obvious: Mr. O’Connor had
conscientious scruples against acquiring opulence
too soon. This superfine self-denial on his part
inspires us equally with astonishment and admira-
tion, and we should be the last to scoff at his laud-
able endeavours to enter heaven by struggling
through the eye of the camel. We trust in future
therefore, that the Distress (in which, as J. U.
triumphantly points out, is incorporated the
Catholic Times !) will spare our feelings. Though,
perhaps, not exactly “soft,” we are, undeniably,
tender. The paper appears to be getting on very
nicely. It sports a full page ad., of a glittering
publication shortly to appear (which is to contain
a "thrilling story by the late Charles Dickens
never before published in Australia ”), and is illus-
trated in a style that is decidedly novel. Nothing
succeeds like success; and success, though pleasant
to reflect upon, is a bad thing to get drunk on. Id
is even better to get drunk on rum than success—
though it generally occurs that the man who is
wildly successful begins by getting nrunk on suc-
cess, and winds up by getting drunk on rum. So
far as Mr. O’Connor is concerned, we do not think
it probable that he will, during the remainder of
this century, attain intoxication on success, though
(since he belongs to a religious paper) It is impos-
sible for us, despite the sobriety of his past career,
to answer for the rum.
King Tawhiao’s artless farewell speech at
London Mansion-house was full of delicious double
entendre: —“ My Lord Mayor, Salutations. Here I
am speaking in your presence, in your own dwell-
ling, in the midst of your own people, where you
are living under the dominion of justice, with the
Houses of Parliament living under the same rule.
The thing which has brought us here I have very
much at heart. It was through my constant effort
that we came here. We had been here only one
month when New Zealand and all our lands were
lost to us; and now we have been here two months
and a half, and we have heard the words that we
are to return and Te Wheoro is to remain. I am
not at all condemning this. I think it is quite a
proper arrangement. All the things have been
brought together under one head, and th« whole
thing has been laid down at your feet. We have
left nothing whatever unsaid. It is quite right
that you should look after the affairs of New
Zealand, and that Te Wheoro should remain to
keep you enlightened in these matters. We have
come to this country, and our coming here has
been a cause of life again to New Zealand. There-
fore, we have said these words that the very
Queen herself should cherish and embrace us and
give us life 'again. Though you look at me and
see that my face is dark, yet my heart is, like the
‘ pounamu,’ clear and transparent, and there is no
warfare in my heart. Here I am, returning to my
country. I freely open out my heart to you,
knowing that our aifairs will be carried on here.
This is the greatest word of all—Love, love. It is
love which has caused us to be called to the* houses
of ladles and gentlemen. I wish to say a word
about a person sitting here (Mr. Hilton), whose
action has gone right to my heart. I will carry
back to my own people the work of a Good Tem-
plar. Remain you here to make things clear and
bright, and let your light be diffused abroad.
Great is your love; great is your kindness; groat
is your uprightness; groat is your charity: and we
thank you for cherishing us. We have come here
to bid you all farewell, leaving one of our number
while we go away and return to our own country.
Dwell oere in your place. May God help you.
Pater Tuhi (the King's cousin) and Major Te
Wheoro also spoke in similar terms. At the close
of the proceedings, tea and coffee were served to
the assembled guests. The King, on retiring,
grasped the Lord Mayor very fervently by the
hand, and said: “I shall ever keep you in remem-
brance. God bless you." This is from the Daily
News The London D. T. report, however, avers
that the King again wound up with “God hell
you I”—which, as he was addressing a Lord Mayor,
seems very probable indeed.
We really are doomed to be unfortunate

With regard to that splendid specimen of journal-
ism, the Cooktown Independent, this is especi-
ally the case. We have always taken a sad and
sympathetic interest in the worthy old journalist
who conducts the Independent, and have bad
frequent occasion to weep over his sufferings, and
mourn over his wrongs. And what, think you, is
our reward for the pity (unexpressed, certainly!
that we have felt for this poor, hysterical old alli-
gator? Abuse! He calls the members of this
stall “ larrikins,” and speaks of the editor (whose

must forgive him. No man who has the editor or

expect to be blessed with an equable tempera-
ment. No sooner is his paper out, than unless no
hides himself in a tank, or sandwiches hirnselt be-

proud of his teeth once, he has so little use for his
molars now, that he carries them in a chamois-
leather bag. slung round his neck with a piece of
shoe-string, un publication days you can hardly,
should he have ventured cut, visit any part of the
town without coming across some of him; and
two-thirds of his time is passed in the doctor’s
shop and the Police Court. Well, he’ll die soon,
poor old boy—and here’s his epitaph:—
Pause trav’ller, for beneath this stone
An editor does lie.
Who, when upon this bright earth, had
A permanent black eye.
Adolphus Picard is the name of a new
aspirant to the pewter of poesy. He lives a lus-
trous life in Launceston, a town of which the
exports have hitherto been principally barmaids.
We are glad of a fresh name in the world of song.
Our own bards are growing more and more disso-
lute every day, and keep us in a state of constant
doubt as to whether they will write an ode to the
Moon or break the office-windows. They are—wc
may as well be frank about it—in a continual con-
dition of oscillation between rum and rhyme, with,
perhaps, an infinitesimal extra bias towards the
rum side. We hope Adolphus Is respectable—and
we believe he is, judging from his verse, which is of
a kind that could only be written by one who had
been, from his earliest childhood, in the habit of
regaling himself upon the muffin of piety and the
ginger-beer of godliness. The subject of his poem
is a further proof of his piety. The title in full is
“ The Farewell to Mrs. Hampson, the Evangelistic
Lady.” The first verse opens with the touching
query:—
“ Hast thou realiy left us for good
And gone over to Victoria ?”
After some mental travail, the poet settles down
to the gaunt fact that she has left for good, and
gives himself up to memories sad and sweet. As
thus:—
“ So clear, so sweet, so mild, so true,
Were those words which flowed from thy lips,
Hid we not ourselves heard you.
We would never have believed it.”
And a very proper way to look at it, too. If Mrs.
Hampson had said nothing, it is very probable she
would never have been heard. But even then
Adolphus might still have written:—
“ Thou dost not seem like one of us,
Although thou art in woman's form.
Thy face so mild speaks thou art just,
Thou fearest not the wildest storm.”
The irresistible impression left on us by the last
line is that though Mrs. Hampson may be indiffer-
ent to the fury of the elements, vet she would
quake with terror if she saw the Picard poetry.
But, perhaps, the next verse would reassure her—
“ Bishops, deacons, priests, and parsons,
Cannot help but admiring thee.
Each one seems to say, • Mrs. Hampson,
Wilt thou so kindly instruct me ?’ ”
Ah, if we had only Adolphus’ gift of rhyme, what
would we do with it ? Well, now we put the ques-
tion to ourselves, we think we should give it to a
cat-and then drown the cat. We wish we had
more space for quotations from this astonishing
production, but we have not. But though we have
to conclude in a hurry, we can conscientiously say
that, in our opinion, if Adolphus Picard were
rewarded according to his merits, there would not
be sufficient blue-metal in Tasmania with which to
stone him.
MR, PEGLER.
Here is excitement for you It is from a
paper published in the fruitful West that we get
this information. Read it slowly, because it is sad:
—“ The other day whilst Mr. Pegler was driving
into town, the tire of one of his buggy wheels
burst. This might have proved an ugly accident,
but we are glad to say that no serious damage was
done.” There, now! That will tell you about
journalistic enterprise. Let us contribute one
little mite to Mr. Pegler’s fame. So:—
This is the rhyme of Mr. Pegler,
Who goes to take his airing reg’ler,
Whether the day be flne or muggy,
la his double-action patent buggy
With spider wheels—a pride and wonder—
And sits up straight and drives like thunder.
And what is the consequence of this reckless
charioteering? The consequence is that at any
moment Mr. Pegler mav plunge the Solar System
into despair by driving against a stump. He does
not consider that what is sport to him may be
death to us. What should we do if we got up one
marning and—while sipping our little straightener
—read that Mr. Pegler Had driven over a precipice
to Paradise ? We should probably go home in a
state of gloom and refuse to pay the washerwoman.
In the poignancy of our grief we should not stop
to consider whether there had ever been a neces-
sity lor the existence on earth of anybody of the
name of Pegler. He has fascinated us in some
mysterious way. AVe are in the toils of Pegler.
We shudder to think what would ensue if he
should burst another tire. A dread misgiving
haunts us that our sorrow would vent itself in the
destruction of a policeman's uniform. Therefore,
we feel compelled to anpeal to the pity of Pegler
in verse of a vacuous character. Void! —
To Mr. Pe o l e r.
(A Remonstrance.)
0, Mr. Pegler, sir!
Tnlnk of your precious life!
Why risk it thus ?
Think (if you have one) of your wife,
Think of her mother;
Think, sir, of us—
Think of our vista faded to a blur,
if aught unlucky should to you occur I
One Pegler gone, where should we find another ?
A man of daring and of dash,
Think of the Nineteenth Century gone smash—
these are no empty phrases)—
Gone smash to blazes
I f on a misty day and muggy
lou should smash up against a stump and knock
to everlasting sawdust your precious self and
your patent double-action buggy I
0 4£, rbymea ’ we own, sir, are not close
(This is a frail ode);
Gut, maybe, we should manage still io live,
though one day you were brought home in a sieve
ta a condition close akin to mince
t erhaps ice should not wince;
Perhaps prolific Nature has in store
borne Peglers more;
P raps she makes Peglers by the gross,
a a raps by tbe dray-load.
so—on second thoughts—we'd just as soon,
If Fate so planned it,
that, as you dro»'« out some flne afternoon,
tou and your blamed old moke should bite the
dust-
Wot that we wish you any harm, but just
fo see how we could stand it!

adher= Qt Creek, where he raised a few
rents, and lectured in the old Assembly
rooms. Yes, we remember the gay old time that
the ‘boys” had at that lecture. And when
Lambert had had his say, a Woslevan parson got
on the stage to denounce him as an impostor, the
fun grew last and furious, Konald Campbell, the
(at that time) elect of Crowlands, was grievously
assaulted by a female disciple of the immortal
Lambert, who got her lingers entangled in his
raven locks, and played sad havoc with his comely
features lor dissenting from some of the opinions
of the apostle, and several prominent citizens got
slightly damaged with the unsavoury missiles toat
were cheerfully presented to the leader of the
chosen few. Shortly afterwards, Lambert con-
ceived the brilliant idea that the time had arrived
when, surrounded by his faithful flock, he would
leave this sinful world and soar away to the realms
of bliss. S® he sti aightway gathered his followers,
and marched them off to a hill near Moyston,
bearing the highly euphuistic appellation of
‘ itood Morning Bill.” There they divest-d them-
selves of their ordinary wearing apparel, and
dressed themselves in “robes of spotless white”
(ninepenny calico, bleached), went to the top of
the hill, and watted for the coming of the Lord.
They expected to spring up in the air to meet
Him, and go cavorting round the heavenly regions
in fiery chariots and things, and so get the bulge
on those scoffers and unbelievers who treated the
matter with painful evity. But the Master |
didn’t put in an appearance, and the dis-
ciples didn’t spring up in the air worth
a cent; and as the night grew gradually
colder and colder, it became painfully apparent
that the ascension robes were j ust about too thin
for the climate. Then it was that the faith of the
enthusiasts began to waver, and, hastily seeking
their store clothes, they held a meeting and decided
that either le bon Dieu or his prophet had made a
mistake, and that they’d better adjourn their visit
to the land that is fairer than day until some
future date. The resolution was carried nem. con.
and the brethren and sisters departed to their
respective earthly homes. But the trouble was
not all over with them then. One female disciple, |
who had left her lawfully wedded lord and master
to join the celestial excursion party, returned to i
the bosom of her family before it was yet day.
She was about as cold as an iceberg when she
rapped at the door to demand admittance, and a
muffled voice came from under the bed-clothes,
after a while, enquiring who was raising tne
racket. “It’s your wife,” was the ready reply;
“let me in.” “No fear,” rejoined the sceptical
husband; “ r " , y wife is gone to heaven; she started
last night, and I’m not going to let any strange
woman into my house until clear daylight.” And
he didn’t. But, when he opened the door in the
morning and she gave him the length of her
tongue, he felt that, if she had been translated to
even a warmer region than that where Abraham
camps, he would not be in a violent hurry to get
her back. After that, the Apostle Lambert re-
turned to his farm a richer if not a wiser man.
Mr. William Beach and Edward Hanlan,
Bsq., are two persons with whom the world has
been much concerned of late, and both have been
olforded frequent opportunities of airing their
oratory. As a speaker, Mr. William Beach may be
written down only a partial success, his speeches
being generally as follows: —“ Mr. Gentlemen and
Chairman —er—I meat, ladies (applause) and chair-
man gentlemen (hear, hear), I—er—this occsion
is—[Deeble: That comes later, Bill]—Oh I I thank
you (applause) . . . reception (enthusiasm) . ,
Mr. Hanlan . . . proud . . . Champion (cheers)
. . . world. (Wild enthusiasm.) . . . Next row
. . . May the best man win.” (Continuous cheer-
ing.) Mr. Hanlan, however, is the possessor of a
flood of eloquence, which not only delights the ol
but instructs the young ; and he has also been
dowered by a partial Providence with a ready wit.
aw£ W the prizes to the youthful winners
of the sports at St. Philip’s Grammar School, Mr.
ttanlan was what the Bum calls “more than
usuaUy epigrammatic.” His flow of humour, too,
| u it astonished the few, delighted the many, and
ho was in such groat cue at Sc. Philip’s that it leads
one to the irresistible conclusion that Mr. Hanlan
must have, at one time, had (say) an aunt whose
intimate friend’s near relation edited a comic
papei. Mark, now, the scintillating sparkle of his
wit, as chronicled by a veracious Hum reporter;—
,‘Op e h°Jh a youngster who came in only second
best, he advised to be first next time. Another
prize winner he complimented on the self-com-
mand necessary for the success he had achieved,
and, after giving away a tine cricket bat, he
handed a ball to the owner with the remark that
usually the pall went first, though this time it was
the hat. Addressing a wee boy who -azed
with awe into his *ace, he said: My brother ath-
lete, I wish you to succeed, and In wishing
you to succeed, the only advice I give you—with-
out which you can never succeed—is to be a good
boy. Take all possible care of yourself, keep
away from had company, use no liquor of any kind,
and do not smoke.” These are our italics, of course;
but we do not grudge them—nor would we, in-
deed. grudge display type and a job-printing
border in order to the better honour such flashing
and resplendent wit. Mr. Hanlan supplemented
these brilliant remarks by again advising (nothing
like being emphatic) his brother athletes ” not to
smoke or get drunk, and concluded with the novel
piece of advice, “Always row to win.” Not even
the hyperoritlo can deny that any man possessing
such splendid attainments must be entitled to the
admiration of all who can lay claim to even or-
dinary intelligence; and, so far as we are con-
cerned, we have very much pleasure la congratu-
lating-, in a humble manner. Mr. Hanlan upon the
success of his educational discourse I But it must
not be thought that Beach, though shut out by
cruel fate from achieving glory oratorically, is left
entirely in the cold. By no means. Mr. Beach has
far too many friends for this; and one of them, a
great creature named James M'Gill. J P., rushes
into the breach, and, through the medium of the
influential columns of the Wollongong Argus,
elevates William to the very pinnacle of fame.
From the pen of the great M'Gill, J.P., we learn
that the champion was the son of William his
father (now with the angels, but whose earthly
immortality is secured from the fact that “He
was the first to introduce the seated shoe for
saddle horses in this part of the colony.”) Mrs.
B., young William’s mother (also soaring), is the
subject of an equally encomiastic notice. “ A finer
specimen of an Englishwoman,” writes, or rather
sings, M'Gill, “ never existed. She possessed in a
pre-eminent degree all the attributes that dignify
and ennoble womanhood ” Born of such illus-
trious parentage, it will afford the snorting public
unliquidated pleasure to be told that our William
“ has all the physical traits of his father, with a
number of the grand moral qualities of his mother,
and he is altogether a most worthy representative
of his race.” Possessed of a fearless nature, the
vanquisher of Hanlan wedded while yourg. His
choice was—but we will quote M'Gill, the immor-
tal: “Beach married an amiable and even-tem-
pered young woman named Sarah Duley. The
Duley’s are old respectable residents of Illawarra,
and Mrs. Beach is a credit to any family. She
seldom goes to Sydney, as she prefers staying at
her own home on the verdant banks of Mullet
Creek;” where, notwithstanding the splendid
fame her husband has acquired, she may still be
seen by the curious frying the humble sausage
and manipulating the family linen. Beach, we
learn further, is a blacksmith by tr-ade, but, as
will be imagined, has ceased to do the “ Old Clem ”
business entirely. It will be seen by this that
William is now a man to be envied. He has
acquired glory, and is on the high road to a public-
house.

1ST THIRTY SHILLINGS.
The Autophone!
THIS triumph of musical invention is acknow-
ledged on all hands to be the
MOST PERFECT, the MOST USEFUL,
and the
MOST ENDURABLE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT
of modern times.
It is a wonderful little instrument, which, while
1 ib weighs less than three pounds, has the
LUNGS OF A FULL-SIZED PARLOUR ORGAN
and executes its music with
ABSOLUTE PRECISION AND PERFECT
EFFECT.
It has 22 reeds, plays in three keys, and ail the
parts of most difficult music.
To Mr. H. B. Horton, the inventor, the world
was first indebted for the Organette ; but that was
too expensive to come within the reach of all.
After years of persistent effort and intelligent
study, he has been enabled at last to place before
the world this complete little triumph over all
the difficulties of costand crudeness.
It requires no skill to extract from it any sort of
music that may be required, the list of three
hundred tunes which it plays comprising selections
from Hymns, Oratorios, Operas, Waltzes, Polkas,
Marches, Popular Songs, &c., &c., &c. A child can
play any of these selections with perfect accuracy
The player requires no instruction fux-ther than
the few printed directions that are sent with each
Instrument, and are so plain that “ he who runs
may read.” It is best adapted to the kind cf musio
which suits an organ beat, in which chords pre-
dominate ; but it has also wonderful power in
executing very lively pieces. It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card-holder for convenience
in singing. It will be found Invaluable for Country
Churches, Sunday Schools. Family Circles, and
for Dancing. Every shanty in the bush should be
supplied with one ; and every household which
cannot afford a piano or organ should possess an
Autophone. It will afford greater and better
entertainment (han four times the price can pro-
cure if expended in any other direction. Since
they were appointed Sole Agents for this marvel-
ous little instrument in the Australian Colonies,
18 months ago,
THE ORIENTAL GOLD CO.,
OK
474 George Street, Sydney,
Opposite the entrance to the Fruit Markets,
have forwarded hundreds of them to different
addresses throughout the colonies. Orders have
come to us from remote stations in the far North,
from distant mining camps, from many a lonely
► hepherd on a far-off run, from farm-hands every-
where, from Sunday-school superintendents, from
clergymen, from residents of the cities—from
everywhere, in fact. And one of the best argu-
ments we can offer as to the genuineness of the
instrument, is the fact that, in all our corres-
pondence, we have never had a letter that spoke
disparagingly of it. On the contrary, we have
hundreds of letters on file from customers who
have written only to tell us how greatly they are
pleased with it, and that they will recommend it
to their friends.
It is conceded by a'l educators and moralists
that music is the great rwfining influence, and
especially with children, its effect for good is’
boundlets. The love for music which music in
the family engenders, is more potent in forming
dispositions and governing tempers than all the
treatises and lectures of the whole force of teach-
ers, pastors, and parents, and in conjunction with
these, is the oil or balm which renders sn other,
wise hard task an easy one.
The price of the Autophone Is 8«h„
and where good music can be procured for such a
trifle, it is criminal tor any parent (except, of
course, the absolutely poor) to let his household
be without it. With each Autophone for dOs. we
send three tunes of our own selection and a listed
catalogue from which the customer may choose
whatever tunes may suit his fancy.
All orders for music are sent post-free by parcel
post, on receipt of list price, and we make it our
business to see that all orders are promptly
attended to.
S?nd to us for catalogue of tunes at any time.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatre Royal—“Estrella” p. 8.
Opera House—“ The Busybody ” ib.
Academy or Music—Federal Minstrels ib.
The success of “Estrella” is such that if
Luscorftbe Searelle does not return home groan-
ing under the weight of his treasure, we may
fairly hope to see him leave these shores loaded
with peanuts In a mild and inoffensive way, Mr.
Searelle’s opera has most certainly caught on ;
and we have much pleasure in adding our own
mild congratulatory meed to the avalanche ot
felicitations with which the gifted compoeer
has been alreidy overwhelmed. Miss Santley,
who “created” the part ot Tartarella, has
been superseded by Miss Stanley, but other-
wise the cast is the same; Signor Carlo Modini, of
Teatro del Maccaroni (or something), still pur-
suing the uneven tenor of his way. As a matter of
tact, the Theatre Koval is too large for Signor
Modinu He is really only a miniature tenor, but
he would “ fill ” a band-box delightfully.
* * *
Miss Nellie Stewart is certainly very suc-
cessful as “Estrella,” and has been evidently
studying the arc of repose. It is a matter of plea-
sure to us to perceive this cleVeb young person
subduing (with a £reat effort, of course) gymnastic
tendencies whieh, if a little thoredeveloped, would
be fatal to even comparative harmony. In regard
to Fie Doge, ttrete is no evidence of the decline of
Day; and Wallace as Phylloxera (a rather rococco
Kocco v -y the way) reproduces the fooling that used
to delignt our ancestors with an air of conscious en-
joyment that does one good to see. Perhaps one of
the most pleasing phases of the performance is the
conducting of the talented maestro. It is a sight
to see the little man hold the cymbals with his
glittering eye, and petrify the flute with a mono-
syllable. Even Bass Hodge—a man of cast-iron
nerve—mouths his clarionet uneasily when the
great composer glances in his direction; and when
urged by dumb-show to further exertions, the
‘cubic-bass saws away with a tremulous hand
ntil he is enveloped in a halo of rosin. In older
to elev te Luscombe’s head above i he footlights,
t services ot two gin-cases had to be called into
requisition, and the carpenter has knocked up
quite a Llliputian staircase in order that the tune-
ful composer may the more easily clamber up into
his throne. In a word, there is a great deal that
will amuse in “Estrella,” and nothing that will
offend even [A truce to these bald-headed gags.
—Ed. B,] We are very pleased we have seen
'‘Estrella.” It is something, you know, to have
beheld “the most successful comic opera of the
time.” We are now, however, quite open to assist
at the representation of the second best.
* * * *
The Circus has left us for the North Shore,
Balmain, Newtown, and other Florentine villages,
but returns on November 9. This is a good hear-
ing, for the circus is a healthy source of amuse-
ment, anfi we own that the blandishments of a
certain lady are at times calculated to shatter the
■resolutions of even the most adamantine breast.
Any giddy notions we may have entertained, how.
ever, were scattered by awakening to the fact
that the ring-master invariably held her on a
string, ana that she infinitely preferred his nuts to
our diamonds. And, good-bye to Madame Wood-
year nie La Kosiere, whose smile we shall remem-
ber, and whose whisk—but we forgot, the
bottle was not for publication, though as a
guarantee of good faith, why, cert’nly. It
was a merry circus, that, anyhow* and everything
was diverting about it but the band. We see, by
the way, that Madame Woodyear has, in Monday’s
paper, an ad. offering permanent employment to
sober musicians. Well, all we can says Is, that It
the fiends in the red coats who have been manu-
facturing earthquakes of discord for the last
month or so were blue-ribbonites, we advise
Madame to secure, without delay, a trombone who
is an habitual drunkard, a befuddled flute, and a
Paralytic snake-player. As for the fiend who used
to manipulate the deep bassoon-he was a per-
fect telephone—with a miscreant at one end and a
rum-cask at the other. To get opposite to him
when he was playing “ Annie Laurie ” was as good
as having a drink—and cheaper.
it is long since there has been (within the
margin of our remembrance, anyhow) a company
whose efforts are more conducive to hilarity than
that at present performing at the Gaiety. All
those who wish (we are quoting Cabcoar Mary)
to enjoy “a hearty laugn ” should (some more)
"pay a visit to this chaste entertainment with-
out delay.” Alter another week, they will
be succeeded by Grattan Klggs, who opens in
“Grasp,” with Ethel odele as icadiog lady.
It would seem from the somewhat erratic
mode of advertising adopted hv the company
that they experience considerably more diffi-
culty in making up their minds than in making up
themselves; for while the Herald announced
that “ Oliver Twist” was to be put on throughout
the week, the management suddenly resolved to
let Miss Ellen Fergus Ogden (this is cloying) de-
pict the woes of the Lady Isabel instead. We were,
therefore, let In for “ East Lynne ” on a most
intolerable night, end condemned to listen to the
blandishments of Levison to the accompaniment
(not unappropriate) of a patter of rain-drops.
• •
It is astonishing the interest this morbid
mass of sickly sentimentality seems to Inspire
amongst the unsharapooed In the gallery the
coatless men and shaboy women, not content with
tollowing the artists with their eyes, followed the
plot with their tongues They could see no short-
comings, bless you I they took cognizance of no
stage waits; neither did the sound of a hiccup net set
down by the author reach them. No; iney were
too much wrapped up in the development ot the
table to notice any defects. No; Captain Levison
wa s a “ willin,” Archibald Carlyle a “ pore feller,”
and his misguided missus a “ sweet creeter.” Look-
ing at the intense interest the drama Inspires in
the breasts of the many, it is a question whether it
'Yould not pay some skilful dramatic author (Mr.
Lawis Scott, say) to confine himself entirely to a
class of drama which unquestionably draws with-
out the aid of scenic display. And, while on the
subject of scenic display, by the bye, we may state
Jaat Mr. Kincheia’s stage pictures are effective in
the Gaiety representation of “ East Lynne.” To
crack our “ wholesome ” little [joke, we may add
that Mr. Kinchela is successful in nearly all he
undertakes. Hem I
We have seen a good many Lady Isabel’s
■n our time-more than agreed with us; but the
tunniest one we remember was Joey Gougenheim,

ngden does not seem to have any bunions: but in
some parts of the piece, owing to the exaggerated
mRgih of her train, she is as funny as was Joey
nil . tlie car P et slippers. In watching Miss
wh 8 hUfformance one is puzzled to decide
vnether the lady has more to learn than she has
lorget, or vice versa. There can be no doubt
wnatever that Miss Ogden possesses ability in
« marked degree, but as, in this piece, she is al-
ways at concert pitch, the general effect is wean-
* “J 6 * and in the lio-long scene you really almost
mnpathise with Levison for getting “ Jack ”
oout the whole concern. As to the Captain
nil' 18011 ot Mr. Frea Meredith, this gallant
seemed to have a notion that he could do
u jl Dln F without an eye-glass; so, whenever he
rvo 6 f 88e d Lady Isabel, he would fix it in his left

inn of that of a cheap barber spooning the

* * *
arimi e J Jarfc Lord Mount-severn was en-
eQ by Mr. Harry Flynn in a suit strangely
suggestive of the coffin-shop, and a white how of
such length and stiffness that every time Harry
bent his head in acquiescence, the “ nearside ” end
threatened to poke his eye out, Richard
Hare reminded one of a phantom who was
unwell. Of the ladies, the best was Mrs.
D'Arcy Read (Miss Elise Sydney), who contrived
to extract some fun out ef an impossible version
of Miss Corney. but the Barbara Hare of Miss de
Glorlan was an impersonation that was steeped in
melancholy.
* * *
From what is underlined in the pro-
gramme, it would seem as though we are shortly
to i>e Badgered by this company in the “Streets of
London/’ Go it! Strike on, and spare not.
♦ * * *
In regard to its treatment of Miss de Grey
and her London Comedy Company, the public is
peculiarly paradoxical. At first the dress-circle
was more than ordinarily well patronised, and the
worrukin man carefully stayed away; but "The
Busybody” seems to have entirely reversed the
order of things, the horny-handed being to the
fore, and the patchoulied “ push ” being repre-
sented, on the night we went, by a score of
mashers (chiefly military) in the dress-circle, and
pretty little Grade Plaisted and the bloated pro-
prietor of the Temple facing one another in pri-
vate boxes. “The Busybody” is a rather funny
comedy by Mrs. Susanna Centlivre, who has
written more plays and married more husbands
than any woman has done in a life time, before or
since. She chiefly flourished during the reign of
Queen Anne, but she’s dead now. We say this
because a general impression seems to prevail
amongst the pitltes that she resides In Crown-
street, Woolloomooloo, and Is rather behind-hand
with her rent. Mrs. Centlivre’s first husband was
a Mr. Fox, who, in a fierce fight with usquebaugh,
was defeated with great slaughter; her second, a
Mr. Carroll, who had a hole drilled through him
In the second year of their wedlock; and her
third, Mr. Ceotlivre, who survived her. Of the
myriads of plays and adaptations of which Mrs.
Centlivre has been guilty, “ The Busybody ” is
undoubtedly the best, her Marplot—whether she
cribbed him from Moliere, or elsewhere—most cer-
tainly giving Goldsmith more than a hint for his
Tony Lumpkin.
• • •
The machinery of “The Busybody,” while
being crude and artificial, permits of many situa-
tions that are provocative of much merriment;
but the cutting to which the piece has been sub-
jected, though strictly in conformity with the pro-
prieties, militates greatly against the success of
the dialogue, while, as a natural result, the unities
and the seq lenee are occasionally broken to
shivers. We have, of course, to deal first with the
Miranda of Miss de Grey. A contemporary (with
whom we used once to play tip-oat) styles Miss
de G.’s Miranda an “arch performance.” And it
is certainly that, and a great deal more; for, in
point of archness in “The Busybody,” Miss do
Grey is a perfect rainbow! So far as her appear-
ance goes, this lady is positively bewildering; but
in many of her scenes—notably that when she
watches the first interview (masked) between Sir
George Airey and Sir Francis Gripe—much of the
effect is marred by extravagant gestures and ex-
aggerated by-play. In this piece, Miss de Grey
steps nearer to the mystic realms of art than in
any impersonation she has hitherto attempted—
and this is saying just as much as is honest.
• • •
The Sir Francis Gripe of Mr. A. T. Hilton
was a performance that was curiously conven-
tional. It was the eternal miserly guardian out of
the old, oldfarces, and was singularly void of light
and shade. Mr. A. T. Hilton has travelled a
long distance to show us what he can do; but
if he cannot a coroplish anything of more value
to the world of drama'.ic art than Sir Francis
Gripe, it seems rather a pity that he ever Jett his
native Poplar. Mr. Morton Selten presented, as
Sir George Airy, a stage picture of surpassing
beauty, though we doubt if the Carker-like smile
he so much affected was amongst the “ business ”
set down by the authoress. Curious mannerisms
actors have, to be sure I Creswick was always
conscious of his boots, Gougmheimof her bunions,
Defries of his sword, Bland Holt of his nose, while
Miss de Grey is as prominently conscious of her
gown as Mr. Morton is of the rdtdlier conferred
upon him by a smiling Providence. Mr. Morton
Selten is such a surprisingly picturesque young
party that, even had he made a worse show of
Airy than he did. he would have satisfied the
groundlings. Mr. Selten, however, was an “ agree-
able rattle,” and enlivened proceedings consider-
ably; which is more than can be said for Mr.
Matthew Brodie, whoso Charles had a depressing
tendency; while the Sir Jealous Traffic ot Mr. J.
P. West was stagey in an intolerable degree.
* • *
It had been considered among Mr. Mark
Kinghorne’s admirers (and there are several of
them) that the hit of his season, so far as he was
concerned, would be made in “The Busybody,'
since he is incapacitated from giving us his Touch-
stone (a chef d’oeuvre d cc—ao, it’s a weakness, we
own, but for once wo rise t-uperior to it!), the
management not being in a position to produce
“ As You Like It.” Well, weighing Mr. King-
horne’s Mai plot, according to our lights, we find it
wanting in many essential particulars. In the first
place, Mr. Kinghorne is painfully demonstrative,
and would seem to lack, in an eminent degree—so
far as this role is concerned—all knowledge ot the
art of conservation of power; but it is only just to
add, that while he may sin against the canons of
arf, Mr. Kinghorne’s Marplot is a comical perform-
ance, and appeared to be much relished
by a grinnning audience. The rest ot the
characters were mere shadows that came and
went; the young lady that enacted Bcentwell cer-
tainly conjuring up visions of a meat-axe.
• • *
In regard to mounting, the piece is all i hat
can be desired, though we have serious doubts as
to the furniture suppied by “Alexander Moore
and Co.,” being strictly appropriate to the age.
However

Billy Bent had something like a ben. last

of the road with a lighted torch in his hand. This
was supposed to be the lire. Then they played at
him for a long time, with exceedingly feeble suc-
cess. The rain came to the rescue at last, and put the
torch out. A final salvo of water was delivered
from the hoses, and the conflagration was declared
to be quenched. Then they went away, and
everybody said it was a very successful exhibition
of skill. It is said that there Is a secret under-
standing among the storekeepers that when a fire
takes place up there, the leaders of the brigade are
to be beguiled with 'beer into staying away until
the affair is over or the rain comes. But we do not
believe this. It would cost too] much to beguile
them.

We quote this item from the Modgse In-
dependent;—“The secret has got on the wing,
somehow, that our senior member has been sought
in marriage by two Sydney ladies with substantial
assets Both young ladies admire him as a politi-
cian, and have sought his hand through friends.”
The story is quite true, too, wo believe. Only it is
rumoured that the “substantial assets” in the
case of one young lady are represented by a
mangle. We don’t know what the other haft, but j
we think she goes out charing. We congratulate
our brilliant young friend upon whichever choice
he makes, and will be happy to give him our cus-
tom in his capacity of husband of either. N.B.—
Wq leave the key next door when we go fishing.

“ 1 was in such a hurry to catch the tiatn
ithat 1 couldn’t buy a ticket,” said the iauit-Specu-
ilator, offering money. “ Yes,” replied the railway
•official abstractedly, as he snipped the next man's
ticket, “ I notice that a Rood many like you are in
a hurry to catch the trains, nowadays." “ Well,
sir, you needn’t be insolent; here Is money to pay
my fare.” “ I know, but I can’t take It, sir.” “ Ah
1 see; the Government doesn’t let you officials
take money. ’Fraid you’ll steal It. 1 see.” “No
sir, tfcore is no rule against my taking it.” “ Then
whr don’t you take it?” “I’m afraid I’d be ar-
reted for receiving stolen property.”

This is a pretty story for fire-side reading,
when the children have gone to bed. It comes
from a Southern town. It seems that there is a
professional man there who has been in the habit
of losing sums of money from his table—though
why he should leave them on the table knowing
this, is, to say the least, mysterious. Well, he sus-
pected a girl to be the culprit. So be set a trap
for her by leaving some more mom iy on the table
one day, and then going out. Th« money was
gone when be returned. Now we quote;-“Ho
questioned the girl, who at first de nled all know-
ledge of the coin, but when threatened with a
prospect of seeing the police, she let down one of
her stockings, drew the silver from her foot, and
was then allowed to go in peace.” Pretty, isn’t it?
We should call it idyllic.

A TERRIBLE WARNING.
He was hammered, with a thud,
Until quite disguised in blood ;

He was held upon a saw:
He was bludgeoned, he was booted,
Execrated he, and hooted;
He was pricked and he was smacked,
He was thumbscrewed he was racked;
He was broiled beneath the sun,
He was shot at with a gun;
He was slashed at with a sword.
By a mad dawg he was gnawed; (oh I)
And, despite his suff'rings grim,
None had pity upon him!

Palmerston (N.T.), used to be a pretty fes-
tive place in the old days, when the Cable Company
boys were there. But whaf is it now ? We looked
through a copy of the local paper which came by
the last mail, and found the only interesting item
in it to be an account of an insane Chinaman who
tried to bang himself. Thiags must have come to
a somewhat sorrowful pass when even a Chinaman
would rather hang himself than live there.

Is worth in such a place. Well, one of the promi-
nent residents was distort ed the other night by
the miauling of a cat. He did not throw up the
window and blaspheme to the silent stars; he did
not fire away his boots. But he went to where it
was kept, and took his gun, which was loaded with
heavy shot, and then, chuckling grimly, he opened
the back-door, and, sighting the cat, gave her, as
he thought, the whole charge. But what were his
feelings when ho saw her rise up apparently unin-
jured and walk slowly away with a look which
| seemed to say “you have done your best to startle
me, but you see I am calm.” He had missed
her. Well, it wrs a fruitful subject for
profane language, but it couldn t be helped.
«o he went to bed and put his cold feet against his
wife’s back for revorge. In the morning, when
ho woke up, he was astounded to see the yard was
flooded. “By Gosh! a spring!” he exclaimed,
jumping out of bed in a frenzy of delight, and
waking his wife to see the splendid sight. She,
i good easy lady, arose nimbly at the welcome
words, and went out to gaze upon the waters.
| Yes, it was a spring—but a spring flowing out of the
tank! He had made a hole in this useful vessel
ihe night before when ho was shooting at the cat.
His wife turned round in speechless rage, and the
r .,ge of a woman is very bad when it is speechless
but he was gone. About a week after his friends
brought in to her a squalid scarecrow, with matted
hair and a frowsy beard, and asked her let him
down easy. It was the husband, and be had been

Up Silverton way, the gaol department is
rather unsettled. The other day a man was ar-
rested for assault, or something, taken to the
temporary lock-up: and, as a surer precaution,
chained with leg-irons. The constabulary then
wont off to bed. P arly next morning the barman
of the chief pub. there was surprised to see the
prisoner enter, chains and all, and demand his
“mornin’.” This having been supplied, the bar-
man said, “Why, how did you get out, Harry?"
“Oh, easy enough—through the bloomin’ root.
Give us another drop of the essence of lunacy.’ -
After this, and a few more, the prisoner departed;
but when he got back to his dungeon, what with
the rum in his head and the irons on his legs, he
was unable to effect an entrance. After trying
for a long time to climb to the roof, and after
many endeavours to pick the lock with a piece of
hooo-iron, he gave it up In despair, and went
mournfully in search of the constabulary. He
found that small but efficient body just coming
out of the Jumbuck Hotel, combing the curry out
of his moustache with the stem of his pipe.
“ Hullo! ” cried the constabulary, “what are you
doing hero ?” “ Why, sir, I got out to get a drink,
and 1 can’t get in again. Have you got the key?’’
“ No, and I forget where I put it. But 1 can 1 attend
to you now—I’ve got to be off to an inquest at
Nuggetty Gully.” Here he prepared to mount his
horse. “ But, constable ” cried the unhappy prl-
oner, rattling his irons. “Ask the warden’s clerk
for his bunch; there might be one there to fit it,”
and, putting his foot in the stirrup, the police force
cantered off. That morning, a strange sight pre-
sented itself in the township. Everybody who had
a key came down and tried to open the lock-up
door, the prisoner smoking his pipe, and taking an
eager and intense interest in the proceedings.
None fitting the lock, however, a ladder was pro-
cured, an aperture made in the bark roof, and the
prisoner waa thus once more enabled to place him-
self in lawful custody. After an absence of twenty-
four heurs, the constabulary returned, very much
perplexed, and with a saddle-bag full of papers.
He passed and re-pas?ei the dungeon several times,
until the prisoner, losing patience, at length cried
“Hi, sir!” from the roof of his dungeon. “ Whatl
that’s you, is it?” said the active and efficient,
reining up somewhat impatiently. “Yes, sir,”
cried the captive, poking his head further through
the roof; “if you please, when am I ” “Oh,
I can’t be bothered with you now,” cried
the constabu ary, setting spurs to his horse, “I'm
otf to collect the electoral roll.” The prisoner that
day sat on thereof of his [penitentiary, smoking
meditatively for soma hours, when he began to

two, then, borrowing some lumber and a few car-

SABBATH QUIET IN SYDNEY.
How sweet this Sabbath silentness 1
No sinful strife to day for pelf,
But solemn thoughts that come to bless—
(I want that pipe upon the shelf).
All things in meditation seem:
The soulless blue-fly meditates;
The blue policeman stands a-dream,
Like the blue crane on china plates.
This is the day whereon to sing
Much psalmody and hymns of cheer;
This is no day for picnlcing
On buns and godless ginger-beer.
This is the day for Bible-class,
Not whistling vain, and idle words—
Though in the trees I hear, alssl
The pert profanity of birds.
And now the bells begin to peal,
And hopeful throngs to church repair;
Their souls are filled with holy zeal,
Their hands with books of Common Prayer.
They portion out the week full well
And piously. Its days are seven:
Six days they hurry on to Hell,
And one they halt, and howl for Heaven.
The preachers now, in various way,
Through all their placid sermons creep;
It is a blessed day to pray—
A still more blessed day to sleep.
Sweet thought, that this one day we’re free
From trade deceits and swindles smug;
Sweet — Held beneath her apron see
Our Prudence coming with the jug!

There is a new feature in the Cakcoar
Maky. It is called “ Metropolitan Notes, by Bans
Collotte (sic).” We really don’t seem to think that
married life agrees with Mary. It doesn’t with
some people—Indeed, with a good many. The
realism of it is too glaring. We know that, so far
as we are concerned, It was heaven before the
ceremony to see her delicately trifling with the
wing of a chicken; but what were our feelings
when, two weeks afterwards, we caught her glid-
ing about the kitchen on tip-toe in her galoshes,
intent upon stealing the cold porridge. We are
uneasy about Mary. What we want is to see her
back in her old form; in the form she was in when
she penned this now historic period:—“ Out of un-
adulterated and commiserating charity we have
hitherto refrained from any reference to the unfor-
tunate and dependent journalistic position which
our contemporary occupies.” Ctla viendra!

The reporters in Dunedin (N.Z.) have the

Two boys were sparring in the office of the

The last new thing in journalism comes
from America, although the scene of operations Is
in Paris. It is the paper Le Matin, which Is being

a new political line every month, or every quarter,
according to the way in which " Government

Lavater once said (at least a Cobar paper

Says the Grafton Argus: “LinleyT.nm-

yet born, but probably soon will be, now that the
G.A. has invented him. By the way, we under-

you know what I would do if I had a piece of fresh

friend. “Well, I’d eat it,” was the savage re-
joinder ; “ I’d eat anything these times.”
We have received some verses headed

A wine merchant of Versailles neglects no
means of attracting customers to his shop, situated
about BOO feet from the ball in which the Congress

lowing sign: “ The noise of the Senators and De-

You can do a great deal for a sovereign in
England if you refrain from interfering with the

a bystander who came to her assistance, and bit a

of such magnificent privileges makes us long to
live in England. We especially long to bite a

A scientific contemporary says “ spirits

of the most famous Irish (and, of course, potato-
fed) regiments in the Army being called the
“Fusileers. ’ [We think it only justice to our

It was an ex-reporter in evil circum-
stances, and he called upon a charitable chemist
for assistance. “Yoi know me,” he said. The
chemist nodded. “ Well, I’ve had nothing to eat
for three days.” “Hem!” remarked the chemist
reflectively; “I don’t think there’s anything eat-
able in the shop, but .” “Oh, it doesn't mat-
ter," replied the ex-reporter with reckless despair;
“I’m not used to it—but if you’ve got nothing
else, I’ll take a cake of soap.”
One night, long after the pubs, were closed
—just, indeed, as we were going to press with the
last forme—a journalistic brother felt his way in
and demanded refreshment. We told him we had
given up keeping an amateur public-house; but
still ho clamoured. And the more we said we
hadn’t any, the more he clamoured. In the end,
we gave him half a tumbler of methylated spirits
and nair-oil mixed. He drank it up, and crept out
smacking his lips. He thought it was rum and
milk.
“A thoughtful hostess makes pretty sou-
venirs for her guests,” read a young lady in a
Bligh-street general-room to a graceful but impe-
cunious young gentleman, and then added reflec-
tively, “I wish ours would." “8o she does," mourn-
fully answered the young man. “What?” asked
the young lady with surprise. “ Bills,” gloomily
replied the impecunious young gentleman, as he
stuffed the “tenth account rendered” deeper
down into hfs breast pocket,.aud looked out at t he
gathering night.

Miraculous
I will now state that I made a miraculous cure
of one of the worst cases of shin disease known.
The patient is a man forty years old; bad suffered
fifteen years. His eyes, scalp, and nearly his whole
body presented a frightful appearance. Had had
the attention of twelve different physicians, who
prescribed the best remedies known to the profes-
sion, such as iodide of potassium, arsenic, corrosive
sublimate, sarsaparilla, etc. Had paid $500 for
medical treatment, with but little relief. 1 pre-
vailed upon him to use the Cuticura Resolvent
(blood purifier) internally and the Cuticura and
Cuticura Soap externally. He did so, ar d was
completely cured. The skin on his head, face, and
many other parts of his body, which presented a
most loathsome appearance, is now as soft and
smooth as an Infant’?, with no scar or trace of the
disease left behind. He has now been cured twelve
months. Reported by

the “marvellous Girards,” and we are really al-
most glad they go to Melbourne in a fortnight to
give some other unfortunate critics a turn, and
afford us time to commune with the most reliable
lexicographer. And a correspondent whose com-
munication does more honour to his heart than his
head, pelts us with the following scintillating item
which, whatever it may be, is certainly not “ perni-
cious”:—“The fraternity of Mutual Imps will hold
a matinee on Thursday, 16th inst., Mr Jas. Allison
having kindly tendered the use of the Opera
House for the occasion. The admission will be
entirely by invitation, and the event promises to
be a very swell affair.” We don’t know what they
are going to plav, but we should not be surprised
to see our old friend “ Checkmate,” and to hear
once more the bark of “ Slocum’s Dog.”

Thursday night saw a large and “ fashion-
able” crowd at the Exhibition. It was the Tur-
ner’s farewell, and Annis Montague was as plump
and pleasing as ever. Alice Rees also was there,
and Max-her mnri. Why do pianists wear long
hair ? There’s something in it, mind you, or you
wouldn’t And the practice so universal. Our ex-
perience has been that, as a man progresses in
music, his hair issuffered to get longer and longer.
The artist who wx - estles with the flute or fiddle in
the bar of a country public-house, is always closely
cropped. As he approaches the metropolis and
advances from horn-pipes to waltzes, and ulti-
mately to airs from opera bouffe, his hair becomes
more neglected. Should he pursue his studies,
and deviate into Mendelssohn and Beethoven, it
approaches frowsiness. What it will become when
he gets through Wagner, it is not pleasant to dweil
upon. Well, Annis sang and Rees sang as we
have seldom heard them before, and each had to
bend, now to the plaudits, now under the bouquets
tired at them from all parts of the house. The prac-
tice of heaving 101b. nosegays at artistes is a very
pleasing one—especially when they catch them in
their little —(not for worlds) I It is also nice to
know that these bouquets are never hired for the
occasion, but are always the offerings tp real
merit. (We got one once. The doctor’s bill was
£30). Fairfax, too, was there. Anni labuntur!
When w© heard him last, we were in frilled petti-
coats. There was a cornet solo, by a Mr. Gretz.
We like the cornet when the big end is occupied
by a mute, and the small by a cork. Yes; and
Charles roused us up with “ Sound the alarm,”
which has been ringing in our ears ever since.

As this paper would be incomplete with-
out a Langtry par., we will just slide in a few lines
about the Lily, trusting our readers will believe as
much of I his item as they can without straining
themselves. Mrs. Langtry recently loft New York
in the Arizona, and this is some of what took
place on that interesting occasion. Two American
managers—Stetson and Gilmore—were awaiting
her arrival, “rubbing tho sleep out of thoir eyes,
when she suddenly appears. We quote: "Accom-
panying her was her mother, Mrs. Le Breton, and
one or two friends, including Fred Gebhard, while
Charles Mendum, her youthful manager, hovered
in the roar, In answer to salutations. Mrs. Lang-
try says, 4 Weil, anyhow, I am very glad to see you
all ’ ” (sic). Suddenly she asks for Mo, her Chinese
boy H e has been photographed, she explains, and
of the pictures she says: “‘They are very good,
only they give him a cast in one eye. I amafraid,’
continued Mrs. Langtry, pensively, ‘that the poor
boy really has a slight cast in one eye.’ ” Paw
thing! Well, the bell rings, and “ Messrs. Stetson,
Gilmore, and Mendum walked down the gangway,
and stood a disconsolate trio on the landing stage.
After a pause, a young man in a light grey suit
and a Derby hat followed them. This was Fred
Gebhard.” When the steamer is moving off, the
Lily is made to cry, “ I don t want to go! I think
New York is good enough for me, after all!”
while her Chinese boy, Mo, stands beside her, his
eyes “ perfectly glittering with delight.” There la
a lot more of this, and, if you are so enthralled
with the narrative that you would like another
slab of it, you have only to let us know, and we
will deal you out a powerful dose in a “suckin’’
edishun.
" THE POOR PLAYER.
Correspondence is invited from [?] of the
Theatrical Profession .
“Poor Player ? ” Of course— any amount
of it; and this column shall have prominence, for
we adore the “ porfesh. ’ It’s a weakness, we own;
hut, like Mrs. Snagsby. “ we are a little liable to It.”
All right, then. At the Melbourne Royal, they
have fallen back upon “ The Silver King,” with a
cast that is exceptional, If only from the fact
that the illustrious “Kyrle Daley” plays a con-
spicuous character. “ Romeo and Juliet has, we
are afraid, turned out a “fr«>8t” at the Opera
House; and this must be a nasty knock for the
lovely twins, Handsome George and translucent
Jim. In this speculation the proprietors evidently
considered that they could travel on “ stage-
pictures” alone, and were under an impression
that the acting powers of the cast formed quite
a secondary consideration. The fallacy of this
absurd notion is now apparent. In the first place,
the engagement of Frank Cates to play Romeo,
was, for many reasons, suicidal. Not that Mr.
Cates is not a good actor—far from It; he is a very
good actor; but beyond having the physical
requirements necessary for the part of Mr. R.
Montague, he is totally deficient In the matter of
“grasp” necessary for the part. We understand
that ‘ Romeo and Juliet” is to come to Sydney
shortly; and as Sydney audiences are notoriously
less tolerant than those of the Cabbage Garden
metropolis, it is to be hoped that the cast will
be stringently amended. But the Melbourne
nows that pleases us most is that Mr. Alfred
Dampier has opened in an entirely new drama,
“written by Frank Harvey, Esq.” presumably
“especially for the gifted Alfred, who appears
nightly as the ill-fated worrukin-man who “ earns
his living by the sweat of his brow ” until it pours
down like rain. Dampier is supported, of course,
by the two little hammer-headed fairies whom we
have loved so well and loved so long —And. to
go merrily on, we may state that “ Fun on the
Bristol” is a bit of a go at what James calls the
“ Bijow ” Theatre: and a new Rip Van Winkle has
uprearod himself before an Auckland audience.
His name is Wilkinson.... And, before we forget
it the Sydney Amateur Comedy Co. showed
on Tuesday, for the benefit of the School of
Arts, when Byron's “Partners for Life” was
successfully attacked, and defeated with great
slaughter. This is the comedy, it will be remem-
bered, in which the following pretty quip occurs :—
She: Its no good crying over spilt milk.
He (gloomily): No. For that would only make
it the more watery.
Subsequently, “Nelson” died to slow music in
great, agony, and the unfortunate “ Village Black-
smith” was depicted under a spreading chestnut
■ ree with much effect; the singer, in the exercise
of a wise discretion, concealing the fact that his
immortalisation only commenced after his six-
teenth feint. . . Oh, and here’s a good joke. The
following letter (which speaks for ItselD has been
received by the editor of the 8 P. Argonaut,
certainly one of the smartest papers in the world;
-‘ New York. August '3, 1884 Editors Argo-
naut: In October Mr. Joseffy [violinist] a ill visit
your city. Oblige me by using enclosed notices,
off and on, in you valuable paper. With many
thanks. Very respectfully, Henry Wolfsohn,
manager for Mr. Joseffy.” Nice assurance!
Appended is the editor’s reply;—” We are very
touch obliged to Mr. Henry Wolfsohn for his
courtesy in sending us the 30 notices. We shall
use them ‘ off and on ’—especially off.” Wholesome
gruel, t’l'H . v id this re uinds us (we don’t know
why) i il gi.Vs “Buffaloes” are at Charters
Towr - , , „<* h. re is a specimen of the veracity of
the Bd"U,iMe Era’s theatrical news:—“A. R. (sic)
Hallilax, who used to manage Dunning’s business,
has joined South in an operatic venture. Their
company, headed by Edith Pender and Alice
Johns, opened in ‘Girofld Girofla ’ at Mudgee,
N.8.W., on the 15th instant.” Grattan Riggs,
who has done good business in Brisbane, opens in
Sydney on the 18th, with “Grasp.” In conse-
quence of his health, which has not been proof
against the heat, he has been compelled to relin-
quish his projected Northern tour, hence his re-
turn to Sydney. . .Would you believe the Kiama
Reporter says that Mr. South’s acting of
Dare-Devil Dick a bushranger, in “Life in
the Sunny South,” was “ faultless.” This is
“ praise from Sir Hubert Stanley” with a
vengeance. We wonder, by the way, what
a Kiama reporter gets for splitting wood a cord,
when he is not writing dramatic criticisms — It
was generally thought that when Tommy Hudson
(now in Adelaide) seduced Miss Dora Brown (don’t
start) away from the Hugo Minstrels, that troupe
would go bung: but the Hugos are still pegging
away in Northern Queensland—Charters Towers
and Townsville Oh, and Mrs. Clarence Hannell
has taken Newcastle by storm in a recitation—
Henry V.’s address to his soldiers—at a show given
in the theatre there in aid of the hospital. After
this came the “ Lady of Lyons,” with, so far as we
can gather, J. F. Keogh as Claude Melnotte to Mrs.
Ned Holloway’s Pauline! ! I I Talking of the
“ Lady of Lyons” reminds us that the late H. J.
Byron once wrote a burlesque called “The Very
Latest Edition of the Lady of Lyons,” which was
very funny In the scene where Claude comes
home with the rifle he has won, he is made to sav.
“Look at this gun, mother; ’twill carry 5000
yards.” Upon which the Widow Melnotte retorts:
“Nevermind how far it will carry, love; the ques-
tion is—what will it fetch}”.. The Clark and
Rymans (whom, apparently, no beetle-poison can
injure) have arrived at Wellington; and also
Wehlo’s Marionettes, piloted by the equally im-
mortal Santly And Tom Buckley, the slim May

A few days ago Arthur Vivian left for Adelaide
with Mrs. Helen V., Jennie Horan, and a choice
selection from the ranks of the histrionic unem-
ployed. They opened at the Academy of Music in
“Leah,” last Saturday, and Arthur hopes to scoop in
bullion by starring the Missus. We hope he may. .
South's Opera Company are at Orange. James
stars his Missus, too, and declares there is nothing
like it. We see that Theresa Horan sings parts in
tights—once more pleasantly deluding a lascinated
public Ashton’s circus (we would write this
item on our death-bed) is (or was) in Kempsey, and
gave a “ ben.” to the hospital. We understand
that James went to the cemetery and shed a tear
on poor old Deaso’s grave. The nearest thing to
the botanic about James being a chew of tobacco.
he solemnly planted the weed beside a pansy A
whole host of celebrities are in Sydney now.
There is Harry Santly, who, finding his innocent
advances towards the premiere danseuse of his
late troupe prove completely futile, has resigned
in utter despair, and someone else now pulls
the strings of that fair but ligneous facinator.
Then there is the translucent Wacksmuth, who
goes away to Newcastle ahead of Jennie Lee, and
we couldn’t tell you how many more. Lawton has
arrived also, and Minnie Hope—which is a good
hearing, as she lights up the city. And agents!

corner for thirty “bob ’ a week, and a “booze
after the show.” We know seven or eight of the “in-

later on, and knife-burnish after midnight in the
"dim religious light” of a tallow candle ...The

A CRICKETI8M.
Of the poems just published,
It cannot be doubted,
Though the author is “ Fielding,”
The verse will be ‘‘scouted.”
A fashion-writer in a contemporary says
that ‘‘the bridal veil originated in tne custom of
performing the nuptial ceremony under a squa’e
piece of cloth, held over the bridegroom and the
bride, to conceal the blushes of the latter.”
Humph! We have changed all that since then.
Now, if the average bride blushes at all, it is be-
cause art has triumphed over nature. The mantle
of modesty has fallen on the bridegroom in these
days. We have often seen a bridegroom requiring
to be supported into church.
He was a colonial novelist dear to the
heart of Alfred. He was so humble—and so cheap.
Well, one morning when seated in his attic, rolling
off an Australian story by the mile, a boy entered
and hande i him a letter and a parcel. It was as
follows: “Want small tail to fit blocks; saim
prise.” The author then handed back the parcel
to the boy, and said “ Tell your master I am very
much obliged to him for past favours, but 1 can-
not, J really cannot, write any more complete
Australian stories under eighteenpenoe.”
The Germans, who have run up their own
flag at Angra Pequena, West Africa, and pulled
down the British ensign, are jubilant. But they
have yet to find out the danger of the prac-
tice of “ complete occupation ” by means of a
flag. It is aggravating for the homeward-
bound hero who has added a new wing to the
Empire, when he looks back fondly through a
telescope at the flag his patriotism planted on a
savage strand, to observe it converted into a pair
of pants for the chief of the neighbouring tribe.
Dr. Riggs writes in the Contemporary
that “ the native-born American hates drudgery.”
The native-born Australian is a perfect glutton
for it. Give him the choice of a Tommy-Dodd
suit, high-heeled sharp-pointed shoes, a sovereign
in his pocket, and his “girl ” waiting for him at the
Quay to go to Clontarf, and at the same time of
skipping out of bed before nine, and taking the
axe from his grandfather, and watch him peel off
his coat. And just keen on watching him—smoke
in bed, and howl for his mother to bring up his
breakfast and a clean shirt.
An old resident of Tamworth attributes
the hitherto unaccountable risings and fallings
and disappearances of Duncan’s Creek to the
action of the moon. It is a strange theory; but
as the author of it is generally credited with
having had more opportunities of watching the
moon than any other man of his age and size in the
district, his observations are not to be lightly set
aside. The moon has done some curious things in
its time, and looked down upon some curious
sights. What a comic paper the man in the moon
could edit if he could come down on earth and
there were no libel law 1
The Australasian— a paper published iu
New York for the furtherance of American com-
merce with Australia—says, speaking for Austra-
lian potteries. “We are a long way behmd Dres-
den or Pallisbury." Are we now ? But what is
Pallisbury ? We have heard of Palissy ware.
Perhaps that is what the Australasian means.
Judging by its knowledge of ceramics, we should
say that the journal in question must be edited by
a cat. Why ? But you see it, of course—what but
a oat eould be such an authority ■ on the tiles!
Abject this, we know—but you can’t expect us to
sparkle all the time on oatmeal and water.
The Mount Morgan mine, near Rockhamp-
ton (Q.), is simply a mountain of conglomerate,
which can be quarried, the stuff yielding ounces
to the ton all through. The owners have already
had an offer of a million for the property, and the
expert sent up from Melbourne to report on the
value of the claim estimated it (if it maintained its
present rate of production) at ninety millions stor-
ing!
Great display of lire works by H. M'Quade

yet seen—about H. M'Quade.
There are many who want to spot the

realised their most sanguine expectations regard-

There is on view at Paling’s in George-
street, a large frame of photographs executed to
the order of the Mayor. His Worship forms the
centre and around him are grouped the Aldermen
and officers of the City Council. It is from Boyd's
New Palace of Art, 354 and 356 George-street, and
is arranged in a most artistic manner. Photogra-
phically, it has never been excelled in the colony,
and Mr. Williams, the manager, and the entire
establishment are entitled to kudos for this piece
of work.*
Income, one hundred pounds; expendi;
ture, one hundred and one pounds; result, ulti-
mate ruin and despair. Income, one hundred
pounds; expenditure, ninety-nine pounds; result,
independence and happiness. It was the late Mr.
Micawber who put forward a proposition identical
with this; and though that gentleman was rather
theoretical than practical in his notions of thrift,
still in this case his theory holds good. Now, we
are not like Mr. Micawber, preaching what wo
don’t practice: we are intensely practical, and
while we give sage advice, we set a good example.

Did any of our readers ever hear of a foal
that was not “ very promising ?”
'"The owner of Leporello was offered £600
for his colt a few days ago, but refused It.
The 22ft. flyer that Reid the boatbuilder
has In hand is being built for Messrs. M. R. and H.
Longfleld conjointly.
For the English one-mile bicycling cham-
pionship, Howell beat Wood by four clear yards
in 3 min. 47 4-5sec., after a grand race.
The win from Middlesex puts Nottingham
shire at the head of the first-class cricketing coun
ties for the second year in succession.
Professional rowing in England is still at
very low ebb, and Bubear has Joined the ranks oi
the ready-money bookmakers on the turf.
Thomas Stevens, an English bicyclist, has
just completed a journey on his bicycle of 3500
miles right across the American continent.
The Italian nobleman who undertook to
ride 31,050 miles on French railways la 30 days has
won his wager. He is said to tremble like a palsy-
stricken old man.
The programmes are out for the Balmain
and Double Bay regattas. Things aquatic will bo
very lively now for some time to come. The Roya
Sydney Yacht Squadron had their opening day on
the 4th October.
“ That corpse that Hanlan rowed against
In the Yarra was an evil omen,” says an English
paper. But it wasn’t the corpse that did it. O, no
Edward didn’t row against a corpse in the person
of Beach on the Parramatta.
Fennelly has gone overland to Melbourne,
and taken the following string of horses with him
all belonging to the Hon. James White:—Bargo,
Salvo, Tremando, Martini-Henry, Tempo, Despot
Uralla, and Monte-Christo.
The backers of the mounts of the great
English jockey, Archer, have had a bad time
lately. In a week Archer only increased his wins
by two, out of eleven mounts. Wood has won
seven races out of nineteen.
The Thames has become so low from lack
of rain, that a bicyclist rode from the mainland to
Eel Pie Island on his machine. It is a long time
since anyone has seen the river so low, or experi-
enced such a long run of really fine weather. The
cricketers all say Australia “ isn’t in it” for boat.
That was a funny performance of the phe-
nomenal English amateur, W. G. George, at
Gloucester—to run a dead heat with Snook in a
level mile (time, 4 min. 33 4-5sec.), and then to win
the mile handicap from scratch, over the same
course (grass), in 4 min. 213-5sec., doing thereby a
best on record. .
A remarkable bowling feat was accom-
Elished at Ashfleld last Saturday, during a match
etween two juvenile clubs. A youngster, bowl-
ing aaainst bigger hoys than himself, took four
wickets in four successive balls, and, after one
blank ball, finished the over by taking a fifth
wicket; middle stump each time.
Granny is getting quite smart in sporting
matters. Why, the North Shore Regatta that was
held on a Saturday was actually reported on the
following Wednesday. Not bad for tne “old lady;”
and then you know it comes so much cheaper to
wait for a day or two, and copy from an opposition
paper that you will not even recognise.
On 18th August, James Finney, holder of
the one mile swimming championship of England
and 600 yards championship of Scotland, met J.
Haggarty, 100 and 300 yards champion of the world,
to decide who should hold the 500 yards profes-
sional challenge cup of Lancashire. Finney won
easily by about 53 yards. Time, 7min. 26}^sec.
Some grand shooting was done at Dubbo
in the pigeon matches got up by Mr. Muller, hon.
sec. to the races. Mr. F. Gannon took first prize,
killing his nine birds, and Messrs. Cameron and
Ellis divided second and third prizes, after killing
37 birds each of out 39. The shooting all through was
simply grand, there being originally 13 ties at eight
birds each.
The only bet known to have been won on
Beach in Loi.don was a “century” pocketed by an
Australian gentleman who has had an investment
upon his countrymen every time they have rowed.
Including Layoock for the Sportsman Cup, and
who took four to one on Hanlan. The English
papers refuse to believe that Hanlan could have
been in form.
A cock-light took place in Queen’s County
(Ireland) lately, the stakes being £500. Some of the
birds came from America. The contest commenced
at 6a.m,, before an immense crowd. The final
battle lasted two hours and a half, until both the
hirdslwere almost dead. The Stradbally birds were
declared the victors as against those representing
Maryborough.
“ The Australians’ performance at the Oval
makes us sing small,” candidh observes the Lon-
don Sunday Times. “ What a pity it was that the
three contests were not all fully played out, as
England has admittedly won the rubber under
false p retences, scoring the victory against a couple
of defeats, which were recorded through lack of
time as * drawn games.’ ”
Jay Eye See’s great trotting performance
must have been a most interesting affair, for, im-
mediately after the 3min. 10J4sec. record went up,
the owner, we read, “went on to the stand and
kissed his wife.” When a man wins a lot of money
at the races, he often kisses his wife. When he has
lost a lot of money, he never kisses her—that is to
say, if she only has the faintest idea of what’s been
going on.
The first heats for the Cup valued at £25,
presented by Mr. M’Sullea of Balmain, were rowed
on Saturday last, the course being from the red
buoy near Mort’s Dock round Goat Island and
back to buoy. The winners were, first heat: Brown
1, O'Hara 3. Second heat: Nicholson 1, Smith 3.
Third heat: Clark 1, Payten 3. The heats were
rowed light in skiffs, the best time taken being
llmin. lOsoo.
We missed “Timon’s” sailing notes in
Saturday's Evening Lyre. ‘ Tlmou ” evidently
understands what he writes about, aud it is to be
hoped that his pen will not be idle this season.
There is one man, at all events, who will not
sorrow much; he not only falls out with every-
body, but a little time ago “ fell in ” through fall-
ing out. Full particulars can be obtained in
Water view Bay.
We see by the Melbourne Sportsman that
Foley has offered to Pox Farnan for from £250 to
£1000, the match to take place in Sydney; and, to
prevent a recurrence of the blackguard scene
that occurred at the Farnan-Jackson affair, the
event to come off in private, each man to have a
limited number of friends present. If this comes
off, we intend to back Foley, and make the wife a
present of a silk dress.
The Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron held
thoir opening dinner at Cremorne on Saturday,
a grand muster of yachts being present, and a very
pleasant afternoon was spent. We noticed that the
genial Old Lady of Hunter-street devoted three
columns to the account of the opening festivities,
while other events that occurred the same day are
completely left out. Surely so much space was
not lavished because the Commo—.
The final heat for the M‘Sullea trophy
took place in Watorview Bay on Saturday after-
noon. The starters were Smith, O’Hare, Brown,
Clarke, and Nicholson. The result was a complete
boil-over, as Nicholson was looked upon as a sure
winner, but got swamped. The right man turned
up in Smith, who won by a lot; O’Hare 2, and
Clark 3. This race caused great interest in the
neighbourhood, where most of the men were well
known.
Poor old “ Pendragon ” has found out that
cricket is a great game of chance. We suppose
“Our Boys” doing so well brought this strange
fact under his notice. He says:—“The more we
look at the puzzle, the more are we compelled to
admit, that whatever cricket may be in regard to
its other claims on public attention, it is certainly
unique in regard to the claim that nearly 50 per
cent, of Its issues are such as would be simply im-
possible at any other game.”
Miller is very rough on Donald Dinnie in
the Melbourne Sportsman. He ridicules Donald’s
claim to the title of champion athlete of the world,
and says he is only entitled to be called champion
Caledonian athlete. He also challenges any man
in Australia to heavy dumb-bell lifting, for from
£350 to £500; or any two men at lifting, boxing,
Grasco-Roman wrestling, and sword-play, for from
£500 to £1000, the winner of most events, he or the
other two, to pocket the dimes.
Bair, the driver of Maud S., says:—“She
is not the timid, nervous animal some people
think. When she was six years old, and I was
getting her educated to noises, I hired an organ-
grinder to play in her stall, and when he ground
out * Home, Sweet Home,’ she put her head over
the organ and almost went to sleep.” We wonder
if Vardy would have startled her, had she heard
him in court when another man was drawing the
dollars for the job he thought he was engaged for ?
The sports in connection with the Church
of England G rammar School came off last Wednes-
day afternoon on the Association Ground, and
proved very interesting. There were twenty
events on the programme, all of which were
closely contested. A. Roberts won the champion
100 yards rather easily, and W. H. Chapman the
bicycle race. The prizes were presented by Mr. E.
Hanlan at the schoolroom on Tuesday morning
last, who gave the boys some good and wholesome
advice.
After her great performance in beating
her previous records, Maud S. changed hands, Mr.
Vanderbilt selling her to Mr. Robert Bonner for
40,000 dollars, or £8000, a nice little sura for a
trotter. In Mr. Bonner’s hands she will never be
trotted in a public race, and it was this which
induced her late owner to part with her. From
the professional trotting men of New York he
could have had double the money for her, but he
refused, so it is said, 100,000 dollars from some of
them.
W. G. Grace’s one ambition, after the very
favourable draw recorded in favour of his county
against the Australians in their first match, was
that Gloucestershire should win in the second.
But, poor Gloucestershire—what a holy show!”
Seven men out for 38! “ E. M. Grace was bowled
* round his legs ’ ” (a crime committed by Mr.
Palmer) ; W. G., “ caught for two at cover-
point by a false hit.” The drying wicket “ just
suited Spofforth and Palmer.” No doubt our boys
had the luck of it.
The Grand Prix de'Deauville was run for
on a recent Sunday, and Tristan won it for the
third time in succession. As usual, he showed a
lot of bad temper, at the post more especially;
but he finished gamely enough, as he only got
home by a short head from Fra Diavolo.
He was ridden by F. Webb. The performance
was a great one for the six-year-old son of i he
Hermit, and Thrift carried the crusher of 10at.
131b. Tristan ran third for this race in 1881, and,
as above stated, won it in 1883,1883, and 1884.
The Otago Witness says “ It is seldom
that honours are so equally divided amongst the
sires as was the case at the late A.J.C. Spring
meeting. Three races, Including the Derby, were
won by the progeny of Maribyrnong; two—the
Metropolitan Stakes and the Craven Plate—were
crrdlied to Traducer. throtirh Sir Mo lred; two to
John Bull, aqd a bke Humber to Express and
Empress, It will be remembered, won the Hawkes-
bury Autumn Handicap, and ran second for the
Sydney Cup, giving: the winner, Favo, 171b. She
was alter wards sold to go to India, and la losing
ao good a mare her owner was deprived of the
services of an animal that could hardly have failed
to win races had all gone well with her. Mr. Mait-
land states that Masquerade and Gudarz are all
right, but Steersman has been suffering from an
ailment peculiar to the country.
Our name for British fair play seems to be
going faster and faster. A fight for £10 took place
at Birmingham, and after fighting several rounds,
lasting over an hour, the police appeared upon the
scene, and the combatants, together with their
seconds, and a crowd of about 300 persons made a
stampede. Later in the day a disorderly gang as-
sembled, and several brutal assaults were com-
mitted. One old man, named Green, was rendered
insensible by being beaten with a stick, and was
conveyed to the general hospital. Another man
was also severely handled. Bravo, England I It
only wanted the introduction of some slung shot,
bowies, sand-bags, t nd revolvers to have rivalled
a fair fight in America.
The Sydney Turf Club meeting was held
on Saturday; a dull day, cold, damp wind, and no
music did not tend to enliven proceedings The
racing as a whole was not very exciting, and no
less than three horses came to grief. The Hurdle
Kace was won by Warrlgal, with Garnet second.
Spring Handicap was nearly a walk over for Sara-
ha ida, Councillor finishing second. The Sapling
Stakes fell to Burrllda by just a head from Evie.
The Selling Plate was a gift to Bryan O’Lynn, with
Burraneer nearest. The September Handicap
made a good wind-up of the day, the finish result-
ing in a grand rush between Merlin, Here’s Luck,
and Sarabanda, there being only half a length be-
tween first and second, second and third.
The English one-mile amateur swimming
championship—which is really the championship
among swimmers—was won by G. Bell, the hnlf-
mlle and long-distance amateur champion; C. Da-
nells, the holder and 500 yards amateur champion,
second. About seventy yards from the finish of
the three-quarters of a mile, Bell at last got level
with Daneils, who had led throughout, but the
latter stuck to him, and for 350 yards they swam
neck and neck. At last, however, the better con-
dition of Bell began to tell, and, getting his head in
front, he, in spite of another spurt from Daneils,
swam home the winner of a finely-contested race
by ten yards. Time: Quarter-mile 7m. 31s., half-
mile 15 m. 23)dj s., three-quarters 24 m. 45 s., mile
31m. 42Me.
Says Lloyd’s Weekly:—“ Although they
ere not superior to the remarkable fluctuations of
the game, the Australians seem to exhibit more
Somnus; while the following 1 sires had one winner
each: Grandmaster, St. Albans, Qoldsbrough, The
Tester, Glorious, Malta, King Cole, Kelpie, and
Warlike.
We notice that Bell’s Life in London in-
tend republishing their original accounts of big
events in the “square circle.” Authentic accounts
of old fights are hard to get, so these should be of
interest. The first one ia to be the battle between
Bendigo and Gaunt, and after that any others that
are asked for. We hardly think the one chosen to
start with is a good selection, as Bendigo knew it
was all u p if Gaunt once got him, so played the
hit and drop game. There are scores of battles
between men more equally matched that would
be far more Interesting.
Some desperately heavy scoring took
place at a match on Moore Park, last Saturday, the
players consisting of Fiji Islanders. The match
ended In a draw, each team averaging exactly one
run per man. James was top scorer on his side
with half the total, and half a run thrown in.
which amounted to exactly six. Mungaro topped
1m crowd with the respectable total of four runs.
It was intended at first to play with thigh-bones
for stumps fingers for balls, and blade-bones for
bats, Just for Auld Lang Syne, but the desire was
crushed out of respect to modern prejudices.
"The New York Spirit of the Times of
23rd August says:—“Since his appearance in the
Centennial Regatta at Philadelphia, in 1876, Hanlan
has lost five races in America, but in no one of them
was fairly out-rowed-his defeats being due to
accident, illness, or fraud. Possibly, when we
receive by mail full details of the Australian race,
it may be found that Hanlan was unwell, or met
with some mishap; but, if be was fairly beaten
seven lengths, and has no valid excuse, it only
remains to acknowledge that William Beach is the
Champion of Champions—the greatest sculler in
the world.’’
Judging from the following, cycling must
have gone ahead in America like a house on fire:—
The bicyclists form a fraternity of their own, and
find friends wherever they go, each town of any
importance now boasting a bicycle club, and an
interchange of hospitalities between them being
universal. There are two magazines absolutely
devoted to their interests, and in many papers
there is a friendly column. At the last parade at
Washington, D.C., there were no less than 1100
wheelmen on the ground, and their evolutions
were very taking to the eye, and altogether novel
to the imagination.
Mr. Maitland, writing from India, says
that the mare Empress, purchased in Australia for
a wealthy rajah, died in India soon after her
arrival, climatic changes being too much for her
even play than our own picked teams. An ex-
! ample of this is shown by the play of the English
team In the second and third ef the test matches
In the one case Ulyett and Steel carried all before
them, the former by his bowling, the latter by his
batting, and those two undoubtedly won the
match for England. But where were they at the
Oval? Ulyett failed to come off, and Mr. steel
made a small score. We mention this only because
it appears typical of our English play, whereas
a difficulty there is scarcely one of the Australia!
Eleven who cannot bo depended upon to disti
guish himself.”
George Fordham, who, according to ru
mour, had made his last appearance in the pigski
®f e ™s not quite done with it yet. He bad a moun
at the last Lewes meeting, and the old origins
Demon ” was received with great enthusiasm
according to all accounts. Even the glory of Fret
Archer has not quite overshadowed Fordham'i
long-standing reputation, and plenty of old stagen
think that the latter in his best day was unsu
passable as a horseman. At any rate, unles
Archer can keep his weight down for some year
to come, Fordham will still have more wins to h
credit than his young rival when they both “ pasi
toe, Judge ” for the grand post mortem even
Old George ” was pulling off big handicap
before the renowned Fred was born.
Bell’s Life in London is pretty rough o
Granny’s weekly, and says:— 1 ' One must go awa
from home to learn news, and we therefore cli
the following from the Sydney Mail; ‘On May;
at Birmingham, in the scratch 100yards race. J. A
Cowie, the champion sprinter, and H. A. Fife,
dark ’un, met in the final heat. Long odds wer
laid on the champion, but Fife never gave him
chance, winning easily by nearly two yards i
10 2-5sec. Now Richie is dead, who will be 100 yard
champion of England ? ’ Fortunately, the ‘ news
Is incorrect. Richie is alive and well. And in de
scribing Richie as a dark horse, the writer show
that he has not studied English athletics much
the Blackheath Harrier being almost as well knowt
as the champion himself.”
Writes “William of Cloudeslee,” in Tb
People (London):—“I believe there is very littl
to choose between the Australian and our besi
proem able eleven; and that it is marvellous how
they, with only thirteen all told, can work as they
do, and hold their own, when we bring again?
them whatever cricketers are at the time showing
the best form, we having some 40 flrst-class me
from which to draw, and any number beside
quite as good if given opportunity. Murdoch’s
defence was most stubborn, and his judgment am
patience perfect. On the off-side he is as dan
gerous as ever, but it is almost tedious to see how
many balls on the leg-side he lets off. His 311 was
not equal to his 153 made on the same ground flv
or six years back, but that was one of the grandes
innings on record.”
Cootamundra Cricket Club. The office
bearers for the ensuing season are:—E. P. Barnes
J.P., president; H. A. O’Donnell, vice-president
E. H. Finch, hon. treasurer ; H. Stafford, hon

diets v. Bachelors, captained by Meyrick ant
O’Donnell respectively—was commenced o n Satur-
day. The latter team went first to the wicket, anc
scored 127, out of which Julian made 71 not out
O’Donnell 16, and J. P, Duhigg 15. At the call ol
time the married men had lost six wickets for nine
runs. A nigger minstrel entertainment in aid of
the funds of the Club will take place the latter end
of this month.
Cycling is evidently all the go with our
Queensland cousins, judging from the grand meet
tney had at Toowong, Brisbane. There was any
amount of racing, and some of the events were
very big ones; among others, the two-mile race
for a silver cup, value £50, presented by the St
Jacobs Oil people. We don’t know whether you
ever heard of the oil before or not. We have; we
dropped on an advertisement in a foreign paper
quite by chance. But to return to their Cup, it has
to be won three times in succession; and C W
Bennett got the leg in this time In 6min. Isec,
There was also a five-mile intercolonial champion
race, which was also won by Bennett, Attwood of
Sydney being second; the time was 18mio. 13Usec.
Some foot-races were thrown in to vary the per-
formance, and the half-mile champion foot-race
was won by T. Bond In Imin. 58sec., W. Gibson 2nd,
W. Telford 3rd.
A letter from Mr. Joseph Thompson an-
nounces that, all going well, he wilt arrive in Mel-
bourne on the 25th of October, and no doubt the
“ leviathan ” will enliven proceedings He has not
had a very good time at betting lu the old country
but otherwise he has enjoyed himself immensely.
Among other places he visited was the Duke of
Westminster’s estate, which he, in his extraor-
dinary vernacular, denominates “the Duke’s
‘drum,’ ’’ and he speaks in glowing terms of
everything he saw, including the two Derby
winners, Bend Or and Shotover. Paris he con-
siders the finest city in the world. Of course, he
went to see the Grand Prix, and was bursting to
lay a wager; but, as he couldn’t parlez vous, he got
but one bet, 600 to 400 against Little Duck He
couldn’t see anything of the race; but when ho
beheld the excitable Frenchmen throwing their
arms round each other’s neck, and saluting on the
cheek, he know his money had gone, and drowned
his sorrow in a bowl—he terms It “ booze.” It is
wonderful, he says, to see the ladies betting, and
the manner in which six Circassian beauties put
down the pieces made the prespiration pour off
their lord and master, a fat and greasy Turkish
swell, who saw his money melting away in a most
alarming fashion.
The first heats in the running and walking
contests came off last ISaturday at Kelly’s new
running grounds. Botany. There being three
quarter-mile heats for the running, and two
seven-mile heats for the walking handicap. A
very large attendance was on the ground, as was
to be expected from the men entered, and, of
course, any amount of interest taken in the
events. For the quarter-mile the .following have
a leg in for the final, to be run on the 11th; - First

The Dempsey and Fulljames glove-fight*
for 2000 dols. and the light-weight championship
of America, took place on July 30 at a noted fish-
ing resort on Staten Island, about twenty miles
from New York city. Dempsey is an Irishman,
twenty-one years old, 5ft. Sin. high, and weighing
9st. 41b, in condition. Fulljames is an Englishman,
rising thirty-two. He stanus 5ft. 4J£in ,and weighs
8st. 101b. Only about twenty persons, it seems,
received “the tip” as to the locality of the con-
test. Dempsey was seconded by Arthur Chambers
and Professor Watson; Fulljames was looked after
by John Flood and Barney Aaron. A man named
Maliahan was chosen as referee, and umpires,
time-keeper, bottle-holder, and other function-
aries were duly appointed. The men wore ordi-
nary driving gloves. The combat was a desperate
one. Dempsey gained first blood and first knock-
down blow, and finally won in twenty-one rounds
lasting thirty-five minutes. Dempsey’s umpire
claimed several fouls for his man, but Maliahan
declared that he was there to decide the fight on
the merits of the men, and that he was going to do
so. Fulljames fought a game, uphill fight, but it
was no use, for he was over-matched. After the
fifteenth x-ound it was 2 to! on Dempsey. In the
twenty-first round, Barney Aaron, who said it was
no u?e, threw up the spong’, and Maliahan de-
clar, d Dempsey the dinner. Fulljames protested,
swearing he could fight an hour yet, but his

August Fuowjsr. —The most miserable
beings In the world are those suffering from Dys-

five per cent. of the people are afflicted with these
two diseases and their effects : such as Sour
Stomach, Sick Headache, Habitual Costivenoss,
Palpitation of the Heart, Heart-burn, Waterbrash,
gnawing and burning pains at the pit of the

greeable taste in the mouth, coming up of food

hackers insisted upon his retiring. After the fight
TJemnsey walked over to Fulljames and handed
him 50 dols. Both pugilists were badly punished,
hut Dempsey was not marked about the face.
According to one reporter, Fulljames “took his
medicine like a Spartan, and displayed great
courage from start to finish.” When all was over
Mart Malone, Fulljames's backer, offered to match
a pugilist inside 10st. against Dempsey for 2600
dole. This offer was held over for consideration.
The Australian says: “Steps are about
to be taken to revive the Public Service Challenge
Cun races. A few years ago a fifty-guinea trophy |
was purchased by subscription, and, after a series
of good contests, was carried off by the Treasury
crew for tho third time and passed into their pos-
session. Contributions are to bo gathered from
the Government ofilcers for the purchase of
another cup, and then the various departments
■will be requested to send representative crows to
compete lor it.” Could not our Government
officers take a hint from this and get something of
the same sort started ? Contests like these bring
the officers together and promote good fellowship,
besides very probably developing some good oars-
men, as many will go in for an office race who will
not tackle a club contest. “ Crews are now form-
ing for the annual competition for the Warehouse-
men’s Challenge Cup. Messrs. Watson and Sons
are the present holders, and representatives from
M‘Arthur and Co. and Messrs. Paterson, Laing,
and Bruce intend endeavouring to wrest the trophy
from them.” This is in great contrast to our Cup,
which, if our memory does not deceive us, only
produced a walk over last year, and is to result in
another this year. Certainly our warehousemen
have exhibited great courtesy to tho donor of the
handsome trophy.
The East Melbourne Cricket Club intend
to make their ground at Jollmont as complete as
possible. Plans of the proposed new pavilion,
which will be constructed of brick, are now in the
hands of the East Melbourne committee. The de-
sign, which is very handsome, is by Messrs. Grain-
ger and D’Ebro, the well-known architects. These
gentlemen have given their services gratis, not
only in preparing plans of the pavilion, but also in
supervising tho erection of a 9-ft. picket fence
already up. It is hardly necessary to say that the
Jolimonters feel much indebted to these gentle-
men for their kindness. Judging from the de-
scription of the plans, the new pavilion will bo a
commodious, substantial, and well-arranged build-
ing; handsome, but unpretentious in appearance.
The ground floor will contain a committee-room,
a bar 42ft. by 17ft. 6in., a skittle alley 36ft. by 30ft,
and there will be also ample accommodation for
the curator. On the upper floor there will be a
large meeting-room, three comfortable dressing-
rooms (one of them 52ft. by 17ft. 6in.). a small bar,
a reading-room, and three bath rooms with double
showers in each. There will be a neat balcony
above, and a spacious verandah below, aod seats in
each that will altogether give sitting room for
about 350 persons. In short, every care has been
taken to see that adequate accommodation will bo
provided for members. The cost of the pavilion
will be about £1500.
The North Shore Rowing Club had their
fifth annual regatta last Saturday afternoon, and
had a good muster of visitors. The fast and
powerful steamer Cammaray followed the races —
we may safely say she followed, tor she was unable
to come near the pullers, the only thing she did
beat was a lad out practising in a tub for the Bal-
main regatta, and that was after a desperate
struggle. The Marine Board might very fairly, In
her case, remove any restriction about going over
half-speed above Bradley’s Head. Five races were
got through, the first being maiden fours—New-
man, Cad ell, Lord, and Obery winning by three
lengths from Carniegie, Eaton, Scott, and
Brown. Maiden sculls: W. H. Brown 1, A.
Eaton 2, G. M’Farlaue 3. Junior clinker out-
riggers: N.S.R.C. Connolly, Creswell, Banks, and
Rich, 1, M.R C. Grace, Warne, Taylor, and
Brindley, 1. This race was a good one, the Mer-
cantile men making a big mistake in the
course they took, which put them into a lot of
rough water. The winners came in a length and a
half to the good. Senior double sculls: Lord an<l
Oberg 1, Robey and Robey 3, Eveston and Crowley
3: won by five lengths. Scratch fours: Dawes,
Davies, Oberg, and Rich, 1; Robertson, Lord, S. G.
Robey, and Burke, 3: Gilflllan, H. H. Robey, Tre-
beck, and Conolly, 3. This was a very hot race,
and only won on the post by less than half a
length. The club were unlucky in getting a
southerly wind, as it was the very worst for their
course.
As the following story mentions dog-
fighting, there is no doubt that it is entitled to a
place in our sporting columns:—In a lecture by
General Sheridan in Melbourne on President Lin-
coln, he is reported to have said: “ Lincoln himself
was fond of a story, but it was a notable thing that
he seldom related one unless with the object of
giving added point and strength to an argument.
On one occasion Lincoln was pressed by some
abolitionists to let the negroes fight on the side of
the North, but he replied, ‘No: the negroes don’t
understand that. Lot me Illustrate what I mean.
I asked an old darkey the other day if he loved his
country. He replied, ‘ ’Spec’ I do, boss.’ ‘Would
you like to fight for it?’ ‘ Whatl go’n fight de
rebs whar dey fire de big guns and stick der bag-
nits into yer? No, sahl I like dis place mighty
well. I’m goln’ to stay right he-ahl’ ‘ Well, you
know that tho war’s all about you, don’t you ?’
‘ I dunno. Dat’s what dey tell me. But, boss,
did you ever see two dogs flghtin’ for a bone ? Did
you ever see dat bone tight any? No, sahl Dat
bone keep mighty quiet. Don’t make no diffunco
to de bone which dog wins. Bone git chawed up
jus’ de same. S’pose dat bone get up and fight de
wrong dog, de dog dat’s goin’ to win, I ’spec dat
dog make it mighty lively for dat yer bone when
he get him all Tone by heself. Jus’ same, de old
niggar’s de bone in dis yer war, and he ain't goln’
to fight.’ ‘And,’ said Lincoln to the abolitionist
deputation, ‘there was mighty good sense, under
the circumstances, in what the old negro said.’ ”
By the American mail full particulars of
the great feats of Jay Eye See and Maud S are to
hand, and, after perusing the Spirit of the
Times, there can be no question as to the mare’s
being a good deal the oetter performance. The
gelding, Jay Eye See, beat the mare’s record of
3mln. lOMsec. on the Providence track, and, on
the same day, Winship, having a running mate to
draw his sulky, trotted a mile in 3min. 6sec. In
Jay Eye See’s effort he drew a sulky himself, but
had a running horse to keep him going. Jay Eye
See never made a mistake until a lew yards from
the wire, but his time was given lOsec.
Private watches, however, held by men like Dan
Mace, made It 3min. lOXjsec. and 2min. 10j4*cc.
On the following day Maud S. made her
effort on the Cleveland track and she had
nothing to assist her on the home stretch
The following in her driver’s (Bair) account of
the race:—“Now, i s to our movements after 1 got
on the sulky. You saw I jogged her the reverse
way of the track and opened her up from the
quarter pole. As she moved past the grand-stand
I saw she was a great mare, and said to myself,
‘You are yourself to-day.’ Then I jogged her to
the head of the stretch and turned her slowly
around as her custom is when about to do a great
mile. She stood a moment or two, and walked,
say, 50 yards, and then she started up of her own
accord, and seemed to say ‘ Now let me go, 1 see
all the people, and will show them something
they never saw before.’ It does appear as if a
public day and tig crowd stirred her up
to do or die. for she did just break loose
herself. I did not mean to give her such a
long score, but then she was so willing 1 hated
to bother her, so away we went on the first
score. As we passed the wire she was going
just about right. I coaxed her back a little,
and at the quarter noted we were going at the rate
of 2min. llsec.; fast enough. 1 chirped to her once
just after we left the quarter, as 1 desired to get to
the half in Imin. 4sec. I got there in Imin. 4}4sec.
Along the back stretch I met Hayes with Caicbtiy,
and hailed him with a ‘How do you like that move-
ment?’ for we were sailing. He seemed astonished,
and afterwards told the boys 1 was going easy. I
aimed to reach the three-quarter pole in Imin.
36sec., and then we would have 33BjSec. to come
home in. She entered the home stretch very re-
solute, and at the band stand spurted, but did not
carry It quite to the wire; then I tapped her
lightly with the whip, and asked her for one more
effort. She finished without lifting, shaking, or
swerving, and I stopped my watch under the wire
in 3:9 3-5. Here It is; I’ve not started it since
That’s all.” The watches of the official time-
keepers made it 3min. 9%sec., Smin. 9 3-5sec., and
3min. and they decided upon the longest—
Smin. 9-Msec. Although the private watches made
it Smin. 9*^sec, the holders waited until the offi-
cials declared Smin. 9%sec., and then gave a ringing
cheer for the gallant little queen of the trotting
track. She was driven in a sulky weighing 451b.,
and her bit was a plain bar with overdrawn check
and bit. She wore bar shoes all round, those being
considered best to save the feet and legs of trotters.
They weighed 9oz. behind and 14oz. forward, and
she carried a toe-weight. At Belmont Park,
Philadelph’a, on the 15th of August, Jay Bye See
essayed to beat Maud S.’s record of Smin. 9%s c.,
but although ho had two trials, he failed, the first
being Smin. llsec. and the second Smin.
On the same dav Phallas tried to lower his own re-
cord of Smin. 13%sec., but in these trials he could
make only Smin. 15sec, Smin. 14)4sec., and Smin.
15kjsec. Edward and Swiveller, the famous team
of Mr. Work, have beaten their record by trotting
a mile in a skeleton waggon in Smin. lessee.

A leading actress was one recent day en ]

A young lady in Ulster County, N.Y.,
called at a lawyer’s office in Kingston, the other

lover for breach of promise. “He promised to
marry me four times, she said, “ but ho hasn’t
kept his word, and my affections are all blighted.”
“ How much damage do you wish to claim ?” said
the polite lawyer. “Well, I was blighted four
times, and I think $100 a blight is none too much.”
So suit was entered at $400 damages for four
blights.
French mothers-in-law owe a debt of
gratitude to M. Naquet, the author of the Divorce
Bill. One of the grounds on which a divorce can
be claimed is Vinjure— that is, giving offence to
any member of the petitioner’s family. If a man
gets into a rage with “mamma” he may expect
to see his wife march out of the door on her way
to the Divorce Court. There will henceforth bo
no such thing as saying, when you have quarrelled
with your wife, “Yes, my dear, you go to your
ma, and I’ll go to my ma.”

ful lover begins to get jealous printed in green,

deep red, with some blots of gore on the sides of
the page; and the place where the hero’s mother-
in-law comes to stay with him for a week will be

A divorce case was recently heard in which
the respondent was the wife of a London mer-
chant, and the co-respondent the butler of the
establishment. One of the witnesses called was a
lady’s maid, when the following colloquy took
place:—Counsel: “Have you ever observed any
undue familiarities between your mistress and the
butler ?” Witness: “ Yes, I have, sir, frequently.”
Counsel: “Oh, you have, have you? And, pray,
what was the nature of those familiarities ?” Wit-
ness: “Well, sir, missis and the butler used to
quarrel like man and wife. ’ There’s a world of
meaning in that little phrase.
She was fifty-eight, and still had the
neatest of figures. But her face was terribly
wrinkled, and she wore a thick veil. It was need-
less to say she was a Frenchwoman. She was in
the habit of visiting all sorts of out-of-the-way
shops in search of bric-a-brac. A venerable masher,
with elaborately-dyed whiskers and a wig, was at-
tracted by her figure. He got to know her haunts,
and persistently followed her about. For a long
time they did not speak, but one day she suddenly
found him standing behind her at the window of a
picture-dealer’s. Said he: “ You seem, madame, to
be a great lover of eld curiosities.” Quickly she
lifted her veil: “ And you also, monsieur.”
A young woman from the country was sue-
ing her ex-8 «eetheart for breach of promise, and
the lawyers were, as usual, making all sorts of
inquisitive interrogatories. “ You say,” remarked
one, " that the defendant frequently sat very close
to you?” “Yes, sir,” was the reply, with a hectic
flush. “How close?” “Close enough.” “And
you say he put his arm around ?” “No, I didn’t.”
“What did you say, then?” “1 said he put both
arms around me.” “Thenwhat?” “He hugged
me.” “Very hard?” “Yes, he did. So hard that
I was near screaming out.” “ Why didn’t you
scream?” “’Cause.” “That’s no reason. Be ex-
plicit, please. Because what ?” “ ’Cause I was
afraid he’d stop,” was the reply.
Anna Judic, who has been engaged to go
to America, has been for years the queen of opera
bouffe in Paris. That means a good deal. It does
not mean that Judic would be specially qualified
to teach in a Sunday school. In fact, strict people
might even call her naughty. It was when the
Germans raised the siege of Paris, that Judic was
first heard in her dainty singing and risqui saying
of songs in a cafd c hantant. She was a mere girl
then, but the had the loveliest arms, the shapeliest
ankles, and the most luxuriant of dark tresses.
Yet the talent far outweighed all other attractions.
It had a stamp of Its own—a mixture of sensuous-
ness, piquancy, and delicate refinement. When
she had a risqui verse to sing, she made it seem
tenfold as improper as it really was, by under-
lying it with gl mces, sighs, and heavings of a fair
white bosom. Judic does not fall into vulgarity—
she produces effects by subtle shades, coy, yet
wicked, half unvelllngs, and her by-play Is the
best on the stage of Europe—hence the upper
world and its women crowd to see her. Judic is to
receive £300 a night in New York.
In lolliffe v. Gossem—an English case, in
which a domestic servant sued a carter for breach
of promise—plaintiff said that defendant, in break-
ing off bis engagement, complained of her very
violent temper; temper, sbe admitted, was a weak
point with her. In August, 1883, plaintiff appeared
to have gone to defendant’s office, and asked for
an explanation. A quarrel ensued, in which plain-
tiff struck him with her fist in the face, and gave
him a black eye; and when he tried to getaway
from her, she followed him and struck him with
an umbrella he had made a present to her shortly
before. In plaintiff’s cross-examination, she said
that during the courtship they had frequent quar-
rels, but not so many as two every ween. Plaintiff
got a verdict for- £75 damages. He was lucky to
get rid of her at the price. In this case are exem-
plified two things: firstly, that, as Rochefoucauld
has declared, the joy of love is in loving, as we are
much happier in the passion we cherish than in
that which we excite; and, secondly, that once a
promise to marry is made, there is no possible
escape from the provisions of the existing state of
the English and colonial law relating to such con-
tracts, if the matter is brought into Court. The
quarrels of lovers are no longer “the renewal of
love.”

SOCIAL
Two happy hearts were linked in the par-
lour at Warreston, Hedtern, on Wednesday week,
when the Rev. T, J. Curtis performed the marriage
ceremony between Mr. John Serisier, of Dubbo
Sldest son of the late Jean Emile Serisier), and
iss Constance Alexandria Bayliss (youngest
daughter of the late Joseph Bayliss, of Sydney).
The young bride looked lovely in a long-trained
white satin dress, with flounces of Stephanie lace,
artistic draperies, and trimmings and wreath of
real orange-biossoms. Her sisters, Misses Emsie
and Lily Bayliss, were bridesmaids, wearing pretty
terra-cotta satin dresses trimmed with silk Valen-
ciennes lace, and berry wreaths to match. A num-
ber of very handsome costumes were seen amongst
the relatives and friends who gathered to grace
the happy occasion. Mrs. Bolger (mother of the
bride) looked happy and handsome in a green
broche dress trimmed with honlton lace; and Mrs.
Bertaux (mother of the bridegroom) wore a mag-
nificent navy-blue velvet with satin front and long
train, the dress being beautifully trimmed with
Brussels lace. Mrs. G. J. Hayliss wore a fine brow n
satin, decked with coltee lace; and Mrs. Goodwin,
a green broche trimmed with fine honiton. Mrs.
Pitz-Boyd wore a crimson spotted tunic over skirt
of cream nun’s veiling; and Mrs. G. Brook, a fine
fawn broche and brown satin. Madame Keller-
mann wore an elegant toilet, consisting of trained
dress of sky-blue broche with Mechlin lace trim-
mings, and feather coiffure' to ’match; Mrs.
M’Donald, darkest green broche; flttiss Strachan,
a cream nun’s veiling and brown pompons;
Mrs. M‘Coy, slate broche and ottoman dress.
Miss Davenport looked bright in a toilet of brown
satin and grey broche, Miss Eva Davenport wore
straw-coloured madras muslin with lace, and Miss
Dolly Davenp;rt, a grey silk tunic with white
spots and lace trimmings. Miss Parker was ex-
tremely pretty in cream cashmere; Miss M’Coy, a
nice dress of brown corded silk and broche, coffee
lace trimmings; Miss Lippman, dove cashmere and
lace flounces; Mrs. Hayes, dark-green ottoman and
broche; Mrs. Davies,, dark-blue velvet, watered
silk skirt. Sixty guests sat down to a Compagnonl
breakfast, when merry speeches were made, the
Rev. Curtis being particularly facetious on the
subject of matrimony. Mr George Brock pro-
posed the “ Happy Couple,” and Mr. John Davies,
the “ Host and Hostess.” By the afternoon train
Mr. and Mrs. Serisier went to Katoomba, and
thence to their new home at Dubbo. A large
number of handsome presents formed the subject
of much critical admiration. In the evening, Mr.
and Mrs. Bolger gave a party, and a cool night
and splendidly large rooms enabled all the guests
to enjoy themselves thoroughly. Elaborate de-
corations adorned the walls, the garlands and
flowers being especially pretty. The floor was in
the best condition, and Mr. Hall and violinist pro-
vided music in first-class style, while numerous
little intervals were devoted to the devastation of
the supper-tables, which were richly spread. It
was late in the morning when the last of the guests
took their leave, after spending, as all agreed, a
splendid night.
* * *
Seventy guests sat down to the banquet
provided by Crlpps, in the rooms of the Secular
Association, last week, to mark the second annual
conference of Freethinkers, and to welcome the
delegates from Melbourne, branch associations,
&c. Mr. Thomas Walker, President, occupied the
chair, supported by Messrs. Joseph Symes, Charles
Bright, and a number of ladies. The toast ot the
Queen was carefully omitted, as not being con-
sonant with the Republican tendencies of Secu-
larism. Mr. M’Cormlck proposed the cause of
“ Freethought,” and Mr. Bright, who has devoted
the last ten years of his life to its interests, replied,
alluding to the fact that some men had to suffer
socially because they could not honestly think as
others held they ought to think. Another unusual
toast was “The People and their Homes, by Mr.
Kelly, Mr. Ross replying. Most of the history of
the world has been written about kings and wars,
or, as Green has it, a " drum and trumpet history;
but it is the people make a nation great, not
their puppet kings. On the pageantry of war
has sympathy been wasted, but it is in humble
homes that most real heroism is shown. Yet
the homes of the struggling poor in Great
London to-day are of less interest to the rich than
the housing of their dogs and horses Next, Mr.
James Finch, hon. treasurer of the A.S.A., was
presented with a handsome and costly silver
tankard and stand, and that gentleman having
acknowledged the gift, the silver wine cup was
passed round to the ladies. Several recitations
and songs were given during the evening, but the
most interesting feature was the speeches made
by ladies. Mr. Skinner toasted them, as the source
cf our hopes, honours, and successes, and Mrs.
Bright, in replying, regretted that ladies were not
oftener present on such occasions. 1 he first time,
she said, “ I was asked to go to a banquet was not to
take part in it. I was kindly invited to go to the
gallery, and see the gentlemen teed (laughing).
I was pretty independent then, as I am still, and I
Indignantly refused. (Hear). The next time was
to take part in the Conference banquet, at Dunedin
In March; and when I was asked to come here to-
night, I was glad, because it is a step in the right
direction, for there will be no social progress so
long as men take their pleasures by themselves.
I should also like to see ladles take active
part in the debating societies; both sexes would
make progress by the contact. Mrs. Attwater
next rose, saying, I, too, am glad that gentlemen
recognise that it is right for ladies to sit to,a ban-
quet with them, and enjoy it with them; and hope
that the time is not distant when we shall join, not
only at banquets, but in our club-rooms togethei,
and go to the polls and vote together, without at
all undoing our true womanhood. Tms disputed
point of woman’s rights is not fairly understood,
even by Liberalists. We do not ask to step into
your shoes and do your work. All we want is that
you will allow us to do what Nature has designed
us to do, and to reoelve the wages of man when we
have done work as well as he. (Cheers.) Another
thing—and perhaps some of you will not coincide
with me—I hope the time will come when ladies
and gentlemen can sit to a banquet to/Jgther with-
out any intoxicants on the table. (Ohl ah I and
sighs.) I see the hands don’t clap quite so readily
at that. Well, I didn’t expect it; you have a right
to think otherwise -but 1 hope the time will come,
because when a thing has been proved to have
done more evil than good in the world, it should
not be countenanced. (Hear.) Miss Stone and
Mrs. Cockerton also spoke. Mr. Walker proposed
“ Our Guests,” and other speeches followed, the
company not breaking up till midnight. A string
band gave the musical accompaniments, and the
walls were adorned with banners bearing the
names of men specially reverenced by Secularists.
* * *
Whoever may have been to blame, the
fact remains that the Freethinkers’ soiree did not
commence till the extraordinary hour of a quarter
to nine. By that time there was a good audience
in the Masonic Hall. The concert programme was
short, Mr. Boyle leading off with “The Boll Call,
and Mr Wenban following with “The Gauntlet.
Mr. Coll, who has an excellent enunciation, gave
with some power a recitation entitled ‘The Jewish
Maiden,” composed by Mr. Thomas Walker. Its
sentiments are hardly orthodox enough to render
it a favourite in ordinary Sunday-schools; as a
piece of declamation, it has strong merits.
« Jessie’s Dream ” was contributed by Miss Saun-
ders: and Mr. H. Ward’s singing of “A Friar of
Orders Grey ” was encored. An excessively vul-
gar niece, called “ Aaron and Moses,” amused
those people who liked it; and “ Wili-o -the-Wisp
was contributed by Mr. Barnett. A duet by Messrs.
Finch and Stewart closed the list, and the alacrity
with which chairs were moved showed that there
was no deep desire to have it lengthened. Dancing
started before ten, Mr. Josepu Somers doing well
at the piano, assisted by four others. The supper
tables were spread by T. Crlpps, and well
patronised. Round the wails were the names of
celebrated Freethinkers—Voltaire, Volnoy, Holy-
oake, Bradlaugh, Tyerman, Cooper, Bruno, Paine,
Spinoza, Besant, and Ingersoll, each of these
renowned gentlemen being neatly mounted on a
shield or banner of pleated satin. These were lent
from the Lyceum, to which Institution the gentle-
men in question (Mrs. Besant, however, beluga
lady) have apparently “lent their patronage.”
While the more staid and elderly parties exercised
that glorious privilege which is inscribed on their
banner, “Liberty,” by choosing to sit still and
deal with fruit and pastry, the young ones added
dance on to dance in quick succession, and, though
the floor was rather gritty, enjoyed themselves a
good deal. Though full dress was not universal, a
number of pretty toilets were seen. A smoke-
coloured tarletan was one of the nicest, charm-
ingly made, and in geod taste. A particularly
lively girl was as green as a toy tree, and she came
from Palmer-street. A costume all of flowing
white was also nice; and a small brunette pretty
in all pink. A tall Melbourne lady wore a simple
slatey-blue lined with red; and a young lady in
figured ruby velvet was very favourably looked
upon. But the honours of the evening were cer-
tainly divided between a pretty girl from Castle-
leagh-street in orange sateen and blue garland,
and a handsome married lady in a cream corded
silk dress with a train—the wife of an orator.

We are glad to announce that Mr. and
Mrs. Percy Jones have arranged to give a grand
concert in aid of the Balmain Rowing Club, on
Friday, 24th October, in the local School of Arts.
It is as thoughtful as it is liberal of these clever
musicians to thus assist their local club, and many
others who have it in their power might do like-
wise. But they seldom do—perhaps because they
don’t think. Most of the leading residents have
already booked tickets, and, as a splendid pro-
gramme is promised, it will probably be one of the
most fashionable affairs yet seen of the kind in
Balmain.

One of the cheeriest little balls of the sea-
son was that on Friday, which closed the Socials
held through; the Winter at Tattersall’s. The
closing ball, however, for which Mr. W. Dickson
was honorary secretary, was held in the bright
rooms at Nlthsdale, and it produced an array of
nretty toilettes which is not often excelled. It is
Impossible to detail all the good ones, but the fol-
lowing are a few of them. A married lady, whose
pleasant face is always wreathed with a smile of
content, wore old gold satin draped with large
tabs of ruby velvet, and round the skirt were rows
of sunflowers. Her sister wore another excellent
costume, the body being cardinal broche, and the
skirt, which was of cream veiling, was livened
with long narrow panels between the pleats, bear-
ing green sprig-work crewelled in silks. Crushed
strawberry was chosen by a handsome blonde; and
cardinal by a smaller and blonde maiden. A young
lady with a very sweet and gentle face wore a neat
erf am veiling with spangled muslin flounces; a tail
brunette from over the water wore pink flowered
sateen, and was distinguished for dancing; but a
young lady in three shades of mauve and lavender
was also pre-eminent for that accomplishment.
Beaded black velvet bodice and cream veiling skirt
were worn by a fair flutterer; white satin bodice
and three muslin flounces gave an air of substan-
tiality to a really fragile young lady, whose general
demeanour was decidedly flirty; while a pretty
girl from down South wore a pretty dress of pink
over ruby velvet underskirt, and her Woollahra
companion was delicious in white and cream. A
graceful girl, whose set smile seemed to indicate
that she is satisfied with the world in general—or
with some one in particular—looked nice in claret
velvet bodice and small white flounces. Itjis rather
unusual to see ball-room bodices laced in front
now, but one looked ever so pretty on a slender
brunette, worn with plain net skirt bound with
satin ribbon at the hem. Except a faint pink
wreath, the whole dress was white, and was one ef
the prettiest in the room. Another all white cos-
tume, that was a treat in the way of good taste,
was satin bodice cut low, with a tuft of green
plumage on the bust, a light flounced skirt; the
sparkle of silver in the wearer’s black hair com-
pleting her prettiness. There were 24 dances on
the list, and several extras inserted, the music by
Mr. Ernest Needs’ band being first-class. Messrs.
A, W. Pearce and D. H. Heaton saw to the com-
fort of everyone on the Moor, and from the plea-
sant way the Social’s first annual ball passed off,
there is no doubt it will be repeated next year.

One of the most successful Masonic balls
ever held at Emmaville came off in the local
Music Hall on the 28tn ultimo. The hall was
splendidly decorated for the event. About forty-
five couples assembled. Including visitors from
Glen Innes, Tenterfield, and Inverell. A pro-
gramme of twenty-four dances was commenced at
nine o’clock sharp. A fascinating young lady in
fdnk and Ivy-leaves danced admirably; two sisters
ooked well, one in cream, the other in black
broche trimmed with real white Maltese lace; a
cream dress with sky-blue satin trimming was
greatly admired. The belle was a handsome
brunette dressed in cream Madras Imuslin with
cardinal body.

Honour to whom honour is due, and it is
fair to say the Gundagai ladies recently eclipsed
all previous records in their return ball to the
gentlemen of the late assembly. Decorations,
music, and supper were all splendid. The cham-
pagnes, wines, and fruit were only equalled by the
ladies themselves, their dresses, and their smiles.
And the variety of both and all would satisfy
every taste. Though the characters at the last
fancy dress affair also figured at this, one or two
fresh costumes appeared. A lady from Edwards-
town, representing Germany, won many admirers
by her step and style; one of four sisters was
charming as the better half of a Pinafore sailor;
“ Gundagai Times ” was a character in a suit made
of several copies of that journal printed on linen.
Several evening costumes looked well; especially
those worn by a lady from Adelong Crossing, by a
Yammatree lady, and by the daughter of the C.P.8.
Dispersed at 4.30 a.m.

The Eight-hour procession on Monday was
a very large affair, including 18 different societies,
each with banners differing from one another in
glory, and each with a band. The bands differed,
too After processing through the streets, they
went to Parramatta, and had sports and speeches,
and drew the art-union. All was conducted with
vigour and punctuality by the committee, but the
continual rain spoiled all pleasure. The train ar-
rangements were what the Secretary described as
“ very, very far from perfect.” In the evening, a
banquet was held in West’s rooms. Mr. B. H. Brown
in the chair, supported by the Mayor and the Trea-
surer. There were present the following members
of Parliament, Messrs. Cameron, Sutherland, S.
Smith, Luscombe, Garrard, O’Connor, Burdefcm,
Hammond, Abigail, Griffiths, Merriman, Olllffe,
and G. Withers. A late start was made at half-
past eight, and grace having been said no time was
lost in vanquishing the victuals or loitering over
the loyal toasts. The “ octo r horal gents ’(as Gar-
net Waloh calls them) freely »xDressed their con-
currence or dissent, as the dill rent speakers ex-
pounded their views; and certainly their views
were not all alike. Mr. Dibbs considered the Gov-
ernment ot this country had done more tor the
working men than in other countries; Mr. Dan.
O’Connor emphatically announced that the Go-
vernment had done nothing for them. Mr.
Dibbs said that if men enjoyed the privilege
<>£ only eight hour’s labour they must not
forget there was a deep obligation on tbem to
put a portion of the remaining sixteen hours to
good use —a man who would rise above his fellows
must exercise his mental powers ; and a few
thoughtful “hear-hears” greeted ms words. All
the Treasurer’s observations were not approved;
but he said: “lam going to speak plain to you; 1
don’t intend to tone my remarks to make them
popular.” Mr. Angus Cameron, in a long speech,
told the horny-handed all he had done tor them;
but, still, there were decided groans, though
low, when he sat down—and bis reception al-
together was not a particularly warm one. Mr.
John Sutherland’s was. He proposed the Trades
and Labour Council of N.8.W., in lieu of
Mr. Copeland, who was absent. Mr. W. lender,
the secretary, strongly urged that the day of the
eight-hour demonstration should be a public holi-
day; and others were equally pressing as to that—
notably Mr. Douglas, from Melbourne, who sbIA
the day was made much more of in Melbourne,
where it received an official, as well as almost
national, recognition; and be pointed out that
women should also be emancipated from their
terribly long hours of labour in shops- Mr.
O’Connor asked his audience to realise that on that
day they celebrated one of the greatest triumphs
of an age of civilisation —the enfranchisement of
human labour; nor to forget the memory of one
who had done so much for them, the late Irancls
Burdett Dixon—to-night, he hoped, enjoying the
blessings of heaven. This day must, said Daniel,
it shall, be a public holiday. Toasts were
numerous, and the whole banquet of an easy and
genial kind. While the cigars were puffing, it was
announced that the proprietor of the rooms had
stipulated there should be no smoking, and he re-
quested that they be put out. The idea of a
banquet where it is forbidden to smoke a cigar
would hardly meet with favour.
• • ♦
On Tuesday, 30th September, the School of
Arts, Burwood, was gaily decorated with flags and
evergreens, to welcome the guests of Mrs. Edward
Griffith and Mrs. Fred. Broughton, who, anxious
to afford the young people a treat, gave a fancy
dress ball. It was the first private juvenile fancy
dress dance given in the Western suburbs, and
was in every way an eminent success. It gathered
in its brilliant galaxy some of the fairest young
faces New South Wales can boast of; it produced
a display of dresses that were, many of them, as
exquisite as art and taste could make them; and It
afforded such a glorious night’s enjoyment to the
youthful throng as will long remain a bright page
in their memory. And children do treasure up
these memories. Dancing commenced at 8 p.m.,
to music rendered by that highly appreciated
musician. Professor Sauerbier, and was kept up
spiritedly till after 12 o’clock. The guests num-
bered about 170; and, as the party was a novelty In
Burwood, a host of parents and friends witnessed
the pretty scene from the stage. One of the most
charming dances of the evening was the cotillon,
which was much admired. The M.C. wore a hand-
some fancy costume as Faust, and through his
energy and courtesy the young folks were kept
well going, and wasted no time waiting for part-
ners. A Venetian Lady of 18th Century was very
beautiful, and the attire suited the wearer
excellently. Mary-Mary-quite-Contrary was a
lovely dress and well carried out. Two little
gentlemen—one as Courtier of 18th Century, and
the other as Bambini—were perfection, as was also
a dark young gentleman as Prince Rupert, whose
dress would have shown better had he danced a
little more. One little picture was Snow, a dear
child, admired and caressed by old and young.
Old Mother Hubbard was splendid, both in looks
and acting her part. My Pretty Maid and Coming
thro’ the Rye were both nicely costumed and very
successful. A little brother and sister as Hunter
and Huntress, who moved about with youthtul
abandon among their older friends, were capital.
Mascotte was excellently got-up. A fine and
striking-looking girl of about ten summers was a
delicious Cherry Ripe. Flower Girls, Spanish
Ladles, Air, Music,Night,Five o’clock Tea, Patience,
Good-luck, and a host of other young ladies were
kept circling in the jocund dance by Admirals,
Captains, Fishermen, Courtiers, Jesters, and other
fantastic but fond young gentlemen. A pretty
programme of 20 dances was supplied, and the
hostess of Emlyn and Leicester House can
look back on their happy children a hop as one
of the most successful affairs of the kind Burwood
has ever had.
* * *
A vBfy enjoyable dance was given by Mrs
Lomer on Friday, atChesney Wold, Glebe Point.
Guests were numerous, and arrangements flrst-
class. The hostess wore black, with long, tight
gloves; and her daughter, in white, with pale pink
roses, was the best waltzer. A late bride, in white
satin and pompon fringe, delighted with her ex-
quisite touches upon the new grand piano, and her
younger sister was also charming in white. A
lovely, soft-looking dress was worn by a widow-
skirt flounced with white eldelweiss laoe to the
waist and looped with black velvet, white broohe
body. A married lady looked well in cream satin
and laoe, with trimmings of pearls and roses; and
another equally so in purple and black satin, pearl
ornaments in hair. A graceful young lady in blue
and white was a favourite In the ball room; and a
fair young lady, with pretty dimpled face, was ad-
mirable m cream satin skirt and ruby velvet
bodice. Pale blue and pink roses were very be-
coming to a sweet-faced girl. The night was all
one could wish, and the new conservatory well
patronised, as well as the grounds.

Among the attractions at Tamworth
Agricultural Show were a skipping contest and a
baby display. The infants were of absorbing
interest, hut most young men liked the skipping
best, because the girls were bigger, and—oh, for a
lot of reasons. The judging of the babies was
done by gentlemen; all specially selected for their
large experience among such exhibits. The babies
were models of vivacity, beauty, and symmetry,
and. the Tamworth paper innocently observes,
“the same may be said of the skipping.” First
prize was taken by Baby Bissaker, alleged to be a
very beautiful girl, strongly resembling its
parents. According to the local paper, “ Mr. Bus-
sell’s baby came second.” Mr. Bussell! Sainted
mamma, this is too l»ad I Baby Bussell seems to
have come to the front chiefly on account of
solidity, weighing, at nine months old, 291b. We
don’t know what sex this plump specimen of a
mother’s pride is supposed t> be; but, if its a
girl, what a weight she will be on the knee by and
bye!

On 1st instant was the annual picnic of
Nimrod Fishing Club at Frank Smith’s pavilion.
Botany. Nearly 300 were there in all, and the
Mayor chaired it at the banquet, at the close of
which the season’s prizes were presented. Dancing
then went on, and the company returned to Sydney
at dusk. The fish will now have a little rest.... At
the Secularists’ soiree, a graceful feature of the
evening was the stage waltz danced with castanets

Last month, at Emu Vale, Goulburn River (Wes-
tern District), a line bachelors’ ball was given.
Mrs. Simpson managed capitally, assisted by Miss
Buchanan of Edina. Some guests came long dis-
tances. Miss Fannie Simpson looked very charm-
ing in a rich black velvet, broche, and cream laoe.
Miss Lucy Frost and Miss Maud Tindall of Mudgee,
also Mls« Alice Thompson and Miss Morns of the
Goulburn, were attired with special beauty. Miss
Harpur, of Emu Vale, proved an amiable as well
as clever pianiste; and at twelve o’clock a fine
supper was besieged by the hungry dancers, who
then flitted round again till sunrise—Byde C.C.

Brisbane, Monday.
My Dear Belle,—True to my promise, you see
I am sending you a few lines from this pretty but
dusty city before my return. Do you know, the
people here are far more civilised than I expected
to find them? For example, on Mondays, when
the Sydney post is in, there is hardly a respectable
man to be seen without his pink-covered Bulle-
tin. But they are more wicked than we are in
Sydney—more openly wicked, I mean. They play
tennis on Sunday afternoons, and have secular
music at nights. Dreadful, isn’t it ? And they are
so well posted up in each other’s concerns, that
they are for all the world like one big family. But,
on the whole, they are such a hospitable and kindly
lot of people, that one can almost forgive them
their gossiping propensities. The Musical Union,
under the conduct >rship of Mr. R. T. Jefferies,
gave the “ Redemption ” one night, and, taking it
altogether, it wasn’t a bad production. The
soloists were weak, it’s true; but the orchestra was
astonishingly good—for Brisbane. All the ilite
were there, of course. Lady Musgrove, who
walked into the hall like “one of the people,”
struck me as being a very nice, gracious lady, and
sat out the whole performance. Pretty Miss
Sutton was with her, and wore a soft cream dress,
with trimming of cream feathers. Oh, yes I they
nave some idea of style here, I can assure you.
And then we have been having Grattan
Riggs at the Theatre Royal, whose picture
in his various characters is in every shop window,
and posted on every inch of spare wall about the
town. “Just look at his noble Oirish counten-
ance,” I heard one Italian say to another the other
day, and the fun of it is, you know, he isn’t an
Irishman after all. Of course it’s hard to believe
this after seeing him in the “ Irish Detective,” but
it's quite true.
The Bicycle Sports were held at Toowong one
baturday, and I think all Brisbane must have been
there, besides country people for miles around.
Before we could reach the ground, we had two
fences to climb or squeeze through, the latter
being rather inconvenient for those wearing crino-
lines. Rut it was fun—great] fun—and novel, be-
sides. The amount of suffering we endured before
reaching the sports was wonderful; but surely it
was worth it to see Bennett ( our Bennett, you
know,) beat the long-limbed Brisbane boys as
often as he chose, The train which was to take us
to Toowong was to leave the station at 2'36; so
when it was live minutes past the time, I thought
something must have happened, but upon giving
expression to my fears, 1 was assured that there
was no cause for alarm, as they weren’t particular
to naif an hour or so in despatching the trains
nere. This also was novel to me, being accus-
tomed to our splendidly-managed Sydney lines; at
tne same time I fancy my informant rather ex-
aggerated matters, for we had only fifteen minutes
to wait, after all. But what with waiting for the
tram jumping down a four foot embankment, and
oambiDg fences, 1 can ted you when we got there
we felt that we had honestly e rued our after-
noon a amusement.
Now, for a word about theidresses. I like as
weu as any a white muslin, adorned with plentiful
ounches of amber ribbon and white lace. A most
peeuiiar hat I saw was a large grey felt—some-
tning like a man’s slouch hat—with a coloured silk
Pykga/ec twisted round, and a double brim, which
looked just as if the wearer had donned two hats
mistake. And under this mannish headgear
was a sweetly pretty face, which attracted almost
ns much notice as the hat. An elephant's-broath

Jf" om hath. But I suppose one gets used to
these tntlea in time;
I have heard a little Sydney news by each mail
since my arrival, and conclude that they are hav-
a time down there, what with Rita-
Radclilf concerts, Madame Marius and Miss Eva
-Lhompsons matinees, th« new opera “Estrella,”
and musical parties innumerable. Just read what
one ot the Sydney correspondents to one of the
Papers here says of the Rita- Ratcliff concerts:
me Ratcliff and Rita entertainments are im-
mensely popular; and they deserve to beso, tor they
are really wonderful. Toe keenest judge would
be puzzled to say which of the two is the more
wonderful—the performance of Ratcliff on the
flute or the singing of Madame Rita. And what is
more, when the two are heard together, it is not So
certain to an unprofessional ear which is the flute
and which is the voice. There is still another pro-
blem—viz., whether one is listening to birds or a
human voice and a wind instrument. Should these
talented performers come your way, they should
receive a warm welcome. The enthusiasm which
they evoke is something to hear. If possible, the
flute piaying is better heard in private. I have
had the opportunity to hear Ratcliff at a private
concert, where about two hundred persons were
present in the music-room of one of our city man-
sions. It was exquisite.” Which proves what I
have told you before, dear-viz., that they only
need to be heard to be appreciated; but it appears
to me that they are doing too well in Sydney to
think it worth their while to come here.
We went to see the pretty Gardens one day, and
I must say the flowers are something exquisite.
They make a speciality of pansies, ana have them
in greater variety than I have ever before seen—
the ‘coalblack” and “lily white” being: particu-
larly quaint-iooking. I never knew before why
Brisbane girls had such a *■ washed out” look; but
when they go to balls four nights in a week, and
play tennis all the afternoon, it is little wonder.
The climate won’t allow them to lead such gay
lives with Impunity, I remonstrated with some of
them, but they replied that “it was all very well
for us in Sydney, where we have so many theatres
and other amusements, but in tneir case, without
their balls and tennis, life wouldn’t be worth
having:.” Friday is their fashionable theatre night,
when the Governor ana suite are generally present.
But this is enough about Brisbane, I am sure;
and by next week I hope to send you a long letter
from Sydney, which, I have no doubt, will be more
interesting to you. Till then, good-bj e.
Yours, ever.

“ Campbell Hospital, Sealdah, Calcutta, March 16,
1884:—Having: heard of the healing: and curative
powers of ST. JACOBS OIL in cases of sore
throats, pains, &c., and suffering while in this in-
stitution with a sore throat, I obtained the per-
mission of the medical officers, who attended me
for small-pox, to use it, and have much pleasure in
stating that a single application gave me much
relief, and in three days, using the oil twice daily,
I felt rid of the sore throat. I have no hesitation
in recommending the use of the same to ethers,
and feel sure they will find the oil give instan-
taneous relief. I would also here mention that
with the sore throat I had a severe pain in the
jaws, which was removed after only two applica-
tionsot ST. JACOBS OIL.—(Signed) E. A. Pereir a
Head Inspector of Post-offices.” *

Dunedin, 9th May, 1884. Messrs Neiil Bros., Dune-
din. Dear Sirs,—I have great pleasure in testify-
ing to the eflicacy of St. Jacobs Oil in a severe
case of neuralgia in the face. After trying manv
so-called remedies without obtaining relief
nothing did me so much good. After two or three
applications the pain entirely disappeared, and am
glad to state I have had no return of the trouble
since. 1 cheerfully recommend it to others suffer-
ing from the same painful ailment. I remain
dear sirs, respectively yours, Julia Montague. ’

my testimony may be of some value to you. Last
week I suffered acutely from severe contraction
of the nerves of the neck and shoulder. A friend
laughingly suggested St Jacobs Oil, and I invested
in a bottle, rubbing it well in at i ight before re-

tion I experienced almost immediately was very
strong. And I am pleased to state that I awoke

Political Points
It is a cheering sign when we find such a
paper as the World saying that, in an article in-
tended to be denunciatory of the rough-ton* ued
Radical, Thorold Rogers, “Oxford, the traditional
home of Tory and aristocratic ideas, has latterly
become the nursing mother of the most virulent
school of Democratic levellers and iconoclasts.”
“All modern Democracies,” writes the
London Standard, “lean to Protectionism, more
or less, from the mere fact, perhaps, that their Go-
vernments have to live by pandering to class in-
terests, and Protective tariffs are In favour because
the notion exists that they benefit the poor.” Ac-
cording to this, then, wo are in N.8.W. not going
to have a democracy but an Aristocracy (with a
big A, please). We have , made a precious com-
mencement.
The “suppression-editor” seems to be as
common an institution in the great English dailies
as in a Sydney daily we could name. In Lanca-
shire, a regular agitation, amounting to a popular
revolt against payment of tithe-rent, has sorung
up and formed the subject of a question in the
House of Commons. With the view, probably, of
keeping up the idea that true-born Englishmen
are too “respectable” to actively resist the most
flagrant wrongs if by law established, neither the
Times, Standard, Daily News, Daily Chroni-
cle, nor any other capitalist print, made the least
allusion either to the occurence or reported the
question in tne Commons.
The S. M. Herald, and other Conservative
pleaders who wanted the Government to prevent
the free use of the Donum for popular assem-
blages. should note tlrs fact, reported by an
English paper:—” Once more Conservatives, under
the present distress, are attempting to seduce ‘ the
working man ’ to their ranks. Private parks for
Conservative picnics are being everywhere thrown
open both round London and in the country.
These picnics are to be the means of spreading
Tory principles.” Thus, if mass meetings or petty
meetings In the public parks were ’’regulated ’’
(i.e. prohibited), only the advocates of ideas which
were favourably regarded by land-owners would
be able to hold political mass meetings at all
The Christian Socialist says:—“If the
underkept human labour machine be a woman,
she has one resource left—one prerogative of her
sex. She may work at policemen’s great-coats all
day, and, because they are not paid for at living
prices, she can spend the night in endeavouring to
wring the odd shilling or two from the pockets of
the profligate or the drunkard. Wonderful supe-
riority of the human labour-machine I Whoever
heard of a steam-engine, when slack of steam,
hiring Itself out for a few hours to the devil, for
the sole sake of making cheap cotton for its first
employer! Yet this is what human labour machines
do, every night, every hour of the night, in this
vast London of ours. Women who might be our
mothers, our sister*, sell themselves to the passers-
by, in order to make cheap clothes for soldiers,
postmen, policemen, and convicts."
The English Socialist writers sometimes
show how extremes meet. In their crusade
against trading and manufacturing capitalists they
occasionally state almost a preference for heredi-
tary land-owners. Thus one of these writers asks:
—“ How many times, I wonder, has Mr. Bright
dilated on the iniquity of the five hundred Peers
of England holding one-fifth of the land ? His
figures are absolutely wrong and misleading; but
that is a matter of very small consequence. What
I should like to ask him is, if it be wrong for the
Peers to possess land, how he can reconcile the
possession of great amounts of personal property
such as he and his colleague in the representation
of Birmingham possess ? What is right in one
class can scarcely be wrong in another, and the
smart tradesman who piles up a colot sal fortune
by keeping down the rate of wages is perhaps a
not more estimable member of society than a
wealthy Peer, who Is content with a very small
return for his capital, and who expends a large
proportion of his income in improvements.”
The Loudon Echo says it cannot under-
stand the English Government’s “ cold-blooded
neglect of its own thriving colonies,” coupled, as
it is, with ceaseless opposition to the extension of
the Colonial empire of other nations. “There is
hardly,” remarks the Echo, “a coaling station
that has defences strong enough to protect it from
the attack of athlrd-rate man-of-war. The Austra-
lians are building a considerable fleet, and they ask
to be allowed to fly the British Ensign; but this
request, which would te eagerly responded to if
the people in power were really anxious for a
federation of the Empire, is refused.” The Glad-
stone Government, which entered office pledged
against further annexation, has taken over
part of Borneo, and New Guinea; has warned
off other Powers from ether Islands in the
Pacific; has annexed large tracts in West Africa;
has pushed forward the Indian frontier; has sub-
sidised the Ameer, and made itself responsible for
Egypt. It ought not to be expected toat other
nations will acquiesce in English seizure of enor-
mous tracts of fertile land, when England already
claims a fifth of the earth's surface. And yet
there is impotent snarling and growling whenever
any otk®r nation picks up a miserable sliceof land,
no matter whore situated.
This is the way the Socialists talk in their
organ. Justice:— “On Friday in last week, a grand
Jubilee me' ting was held to commemorate the
abolition of slavery In the British dominions. It
was worthy of celebration. But we wish someone
present had pointed out the accursed wage-slavery
which still exists in this country. The Prince of
Wales, for instance, delivered a long speech In
honour of the occasion; yet, as we pointed out
last week, the rural wage-slaves on his estate get
about 10s. to 14s. a week for 16 hours’ work a day,
or 98 hours’ work a week. The black slaves' work
was regulated by law at 45 hours a wO'W, and they
were far butter lodged and fed. It didn’t pay a
planter to overwork and starve them; fur he had
to buy more. No slavery that ever existe i in t he
British dominions could be more horrible than the
slavery in the coal and iron regions which Miss
Taylor and Mr. Hyndman have lately visited on
behalf of the Democratic Federation These men,
women, and children arc ground to the very earth
under capitalist tyranny. Women working In the
nail trade cannot earn enough to keep them In
health by twelve hours’ exhausting toil each day.
or 72 hours a week. So it is all round. Whonshall
we be able to celebrate the downfall of white
slavery? Within the ten years, if Socialists
make way at the rate we are doing to-day.”
Here are a couple of paragraphs from an
appeal to the people of England just issued by the
Scotch CroftersThe Highland Crofters are poor
peasants, cultivating small plots of land in the
north of Scotland and in the Islands thereabouts.
Many of us are threatened with eviction because
we cannot pay our rents in full. We cannot pay
as we have been rack-rented for generations, and
thus prevented from accumulating savings and
capital. We have also been gradually deprived of
the use of peat and turf for fuel; heather, rushes,
ferns, and stone for building purposes and for
repairs of our huts; seaweeds for manure; and
grazing for our beasts. All these we Crofters had
ooked on from time immemorial as our rights for
enjoyment In common. No one interfered with
us in the old days, but, s land became more valu-
able the landlords laid claim to all these things;
our fathers were too shamefaced to go to court;
and where could paupers, like us Crofters, get
money to defend our rights ? And without money
who can get justice ? Had not all our money
already gone to the landlords ? So, in the eyes of
man and under his laws, we lost our rights. But
in the eyes of God we have them still. Besides the
sufferings we have already told you of, we suffer
greatly, as we have been driven from our fertile
lands and made to settle on barren soils, as rich
farmers wanted the good soils and the sheltered
sites for their south country sheep. There are
very few of us Crofters left, so we ask you, our
brothers In England and in the south of Scotland,
to save us alive, the remnant of an ancient race,
and to look on our cause as yours.”
An observant working man visited Sand-
ringham, the estate of the Prince of Wales, the
other day. He has communicated his observations
to Justice, in the following terms:—“The Prince
I found has the reputation of being a go-a-head
land-owner (the estate was purchased for him on
his coming of age, at the cost of £220,000 to the
nation). There is not the least doubt the estate
has been marvellously ‘improved ’—from the land-
lord point of view. On every side, as you ap-
proach Sandringham, you drive along well madff
roads, bordered on each side to a depth of 20 or 30
yards with plantations of fir trees, and as you go
along you see the whole place, roadside, copses
and fields, alive with game of all sorts. Royal
cock pheasants, indignant at being disturbed by
aught loss than a Royal shooting party, rise ma-
jestically at your feet, while partridges, hares,
raboits and other game scuttle away in hundreds.
But though the estate has been so much improved
that there is probably more game on it than on
any other in the three kingdoms, yet you may
walk for miles without coming across a cottage.
The labourers have been ‘ improved ’ off the es-
tate altogether. Here and there you do come
across a charming cottage, creeper covered, and
you fancy you have found the ideal dwelling of a
labourer in Aroady, for it is surrounded wltn vege-
tables and flowers, and in a field behind you see
100 to 150 hencoops. But on enquiry it turns out
that the cottages are Inhabited by the Prince's
rural police in the shape of gamekeepers, while
the hencoops are tenanted by pheasants which are
being brought up by hand to afford presently what
is humorously termed ‘ sport ’ lor Royal guns. All
the labourers who work on the estate have to walk
four or five miles to and from their work, which
necessitates starting at 4 a.m. and returning at 8
p.m., a fair day’s work I The Prince considers the
fair wage to belOa. to 14s. a week 1 If the labourers
lived on the estate they might disturb the game,
to which the land is given up. There is reserved,
however, some 20 acres of kitchen-gardens and
hot-houses with numerous walls, built especially
for growing peaches and apricots. But our Prince
has a comprehensive mind; not only does he love
game and grapes and peaches, but he likes to have
foxes for hunting in the neighbourhood. But
foxes eat game, so they have to be preserved by
the farmers at the expense of their fowls and
geeso; and between foxes and game, nice Inroads
are made on their produce.”
With that disingenuousness in the matter
of wresting a quotation from its context for which
the S.M. Herald is noted, a recent “leader” in
that Conservative organ absolutely bristles. It
was a leader on the land nationalisation question,
“the opinions expressed by Mr. W. S. Blunt on
his recent visit to India” being drawn upon to
illustrate the Herald s favourite position that
State landlordism must necessarily be a mockery,
a delusion, and a snare. Now, Blunt’s opinions (by
the bye, the before-mentioned leader never gave
the information that these opinions were to be
found in Blunt’s ‘ ‘Ideas About India” in the August
number of the Fortnightly) do not make so much
against State landlordism as against bad State
landlordism. The Herald didn’t quote quite
enough of his opinions for truth's sake, though
sufficient for her purpose. For Instance, it would
have jarred on her conservatism to have quoted
Blunt’s blunt opinions that It Is the British Gb-
vernment in India which is ruining that country,
crippling It with debt, .and grinding down the
masses into a state of misery and bondage as bad
and hopeless as that of the Egyptian fellah. Here
are one or two of Blunt’s remarks on those points;
—“ The modus operandi (of working the Forest
Laws) seems to have been needless, violent, and
most injurious to the people. . . . The salt-tax
is the one groat theme of complaint, the one that
touches the people most nearly, and is most inju-
rious in proportion to the poverty of the sufferers
by it. . . flhe peasantry is deeply, hopelessly in
debt. It is curious to find this prime cause of the
Egyptian Revolution faithfully reproduced in India
under our own paternal and enligntened rule. . . .
There is surely no country in the world where in
the midst of such starvation there is so much
waste; certainly none where the expense of it all
is borne so wholly and directly by the poor. I
wonder whether anyone has calculated the
number of miles of macadamised road in the
various Anglo-Indian cantonments, not a yard of
which has ever served any purpose beyond that of
enabling the officers' wives to pay each other visits in
their carriages. I wonder whether anyone has
calculated the numbers of absolutely useless
clock towers and Gothic memorials erected by Sir
Richard Temples to Sir Bartle Freres, and Sir
Bartle Freres to Sir Richard Temples in the various
Presidencies. I wonder whether anyone has cal-
culated how many hogsheads of champagne the
water-drinking ryot has paid for in the last half
century as an unaccounted item of his yearly
budget The Government oi India, as
landlord, does practically nothing for tho land. All
is squandered and spent on other things; and the
people who till the soil are yearly becoming poorer
and more hopeless.” Between State landlordism,
where the State is an alien bureaucracy living in
splendour at the expense of conquered masses,
and State landlordism, where the State is a demo-
cracy, there may, peradventure, be some slight
difference, dear Granny; but Blunt’s opinions
simply tell against the accursedness of State land-
lordism where the State is a tyrannical and
“ foreign ’ oligarchy.
His Grace the Duke of Westminster re-
cently sent round a touting circular for subscrip-
tions in aid of the funds of the Sunday Society,
which is in need of £1000. On the preceding Satur-
day the papers announced that the Duke had paid
1600 guineas for a racehorse Under the anti-
Soclallstlo law the Berlin police have forbidden the
sale of the portraits of the late Socialist agitator,
Lassaile, the proceeds of which were intended to
be used in carrying on the propaganda during the
approaching elections.... It seems that at last the
labourers in Ireland are beginning to discover that
whatever the Irish Land Act may have done for
the farmers, it has not in any way bettered their
condition. A Land League meeting at Ohabullayne,
on a Sunday, was disturbed by the labourers, who
afterwards held a counter demonstration, at which
resolutions were passed against the farmers
Tne London hospitals are all in financial straits,
owing to the falling off in voluntary contribu-
tions, while the luxury and extravagance of the
monied classes is becoming more monstrous every
ytar. In London last year, Univers ty Hospital
closed its accounts with a debt of £8500, while for
two years or more King’s College Hospital has
been existing solely on its capital, and these are
only examples of many other similar cases
Lord Rosebery is above all things a Democrat, he
loves the people so. Thus, when he unveiled the
statue of Burns, the people’s poet, he was careful
they should be kept at a safe distance by tickets...
The probabilities of the unlucky fallabeen of
Egypt getting any relief from the blood' sucking
policy of squeezing them for the benefit of
usurious bondholders, may be estimated by con-
sidering that Lord Northbrook, who has been sent
by the Government as special commissioner to
report on the condition or Egypt and advise as to
its future treatment, is connected with the financ-
ing firm of Baring. A London paper, commenting
on Lord Northbrook’s mission, remarks with truth
that “the bombardment of Alexandria, and sub-
sequent massacres of Tei-el-Keblr, Tamanieb, and
others, were preceded by just such professions
of solicitude for the welfare of the people
of Egypt as now flow in profusion from
the lips of the Prime Minister and others.”....
Agrarian discontent is active in Scotland. In one
* , 8 three agrarian fires took place, one at
Arbirlot, near Arbroath; another at Ballochallan,
In Perthshire, and the third near Falkirk. Now a
large robbery of dynamite is reported as having
taken place from mining works in Lanarkshire.
I he police have been unable to discover the per-
petrators, and there is great fear some outrage
“ay be in contemplation.. .To add to the popu-
larity of landlordism in the Scottish islands, the
police of Lewes, under a Sheriff’s officer, one John
Eraser, arrested two poor women one night last
week while in their beds. Their offence was re-
sisting the police while attempting to puli down a
spall house erected by Roderick Graham, the son
ot the elder woman, which he had put up without,
it was alleged, the consent of the estate manager.
The old woman, seventu years of age, was sent to
prison for eight davs; the younger was cautioned...
Lord Cranborne, eldest son of the Marquis of Salis-
bury, has been accepted as Conservative candidate
for King s Lynn at the next election. Tnis young
gentleman, aged 23, but a few weeks earlier
had taken a third class in history at Oxford. Just
escaped ‘plucking.” ...Michael Davltt at several
meetings in Ireland has been urging the Irish to
Join the English Democracy in their attack on the
House of Lords. They may then trust, he says,
the English people to aid them in putting down
the Infamous Castle rule.
“One of the Loard’s Anointed” is the
Rev. J. A. Nicol, a Free (painfully free) Church
minister of the Presbyterian stamp, who has been
banging round Satan on the fruitful plains of the
Wlmmera (Vic.) for several years past. It appears
that the stock of this particular style of parson in
Victoria is limited to five; and, if we may judge
them, by their fruits, the stock would bear reduc-
ing by about the same number without hurting
the morals of the Cabbage Garden tillers. The
Rev. Nicol undertook to preach the glad tidings in
the far north-west, his hunting-grounds reaching
from Rupanyupto Warraoknabeal, even unto the
border of the Mallee scrub; and his ministrations
would have been productive of great good among
the simple wheat-growers in that region had “ his
brethren in the Loard” not persecuted him, and
formed vile conspiracies to ruin him. At least, so
the Rev. Nicol says, and he ought to know. But
in an evil hour one of the sanctified quintette of
parsons became the editor of a religious sheet
called the Presbyter, and with that charity
which “covereth a multitude of sins” he be-
gftu to point out some of the shortcomings
of bis brother in the Loard — shortcomings,
in fact, of a decidedly giddy nature. Then this
pious pair commenced slangwhanglng each other,
the one In the Presbyter and the other in the
Dunmunkle Standard, until the fun culminated
in the County Court, Melbourne, where the Rev.
A. Paul, the editor of the Presbyter, sued the
Rev. Nicol for £99 damages for libel. The libel
consisted of a couple of letters written to the rev.
editor by meonister Nicol, in which the latter
cheerfully remarked that he would “stop the
mouth of liars ’’—referring, of course, te the men-
dacity of brother Paul in particular—and also in
sending post-cards to the pious scribe which were
the reverse of complimentary. Parsen Nicol
pleaded justification, relying on the articles pub-
lished in the Presbyter; and evidence was taken
which enabled the unregenerate to have a peep
behind the veil of sanctity and get a glimpse of
the doings of the “ unco guid.” The weak point of
the Rev. Nicol—if weak point it be—was his par-
tiality for ladies’ society, a weakness thus referred
to by one of Erin’s greatest bards —
“And if I be fond of the girls.
Sure that’s no bad sign of a man.”
It was alleged, Indeed, that when returning from
church the reverend and amorous Nicol would
squeeze himself into an already over-crowded
buggy, and then sandwich himself betwf en two
of the nicest of his female parishioners, with the
laudable desire of keeping them warm; but that
was explained away by another of the quintette,
who said, “ I can understand, in the country, that
people going home from church will very often
crowd into vehicles, and it will happen that. If the
vehicle be the clergyman’s, he may pack in more
than ho should.” Certainly, and why shouldn’t
he ? Now, when we used to drive to church
[Enough of that. We want facts —Ed. B.] And
then, again, the Rev. Nicol was accused of taking
more than a fatherly interest in someO f the matrons
of his flock. It was broadly asserteu that on one
occasion he called on a certain lady residing near
Rupanyup, during the temporary absence of her
lord, wnen his endearments had such an amatory
tendency that the lady was charitable enough to
impute hla vagaries to affection of the brain.
However, she repulsed his delicate attentions,
whereupon he knelt down and prayed, and after-
wards proceeded to read a chapter from the Bible
for her edification. Then, in the Innocence of her
heart, she thought that “ when he took God’s boov
out of his pocket that all the evil was over, if
evil he meant.” But this gay parson was not
to be put off so easily, and again, according to
evidence, he repeater his giddy conduct, but with
no better success. Then finding his little game
was up. he said, “ I hope I have not offended you,”
and afterwards went whining to her irate hus-
band, to apologise for his carryings-on. Of course,
we cannot give the grimy details of the case-they
are only fit for papers of the Nooze pattern-hut
sufficient is given to show what a distance separ-
ates these followe rs of the Loard from their pre-
tended Master. The case lasted some three days,
and the Intelligent jury brought in a verdict for
the plaintiff, awarding him one farthing damages—
not by any means a princely sum, but perhaps,
after all, a fair estimate of the value of the char-
acter of a Free Church Presbyterian meenister,
judging by the evidence adduced. The Rev. Paul
can now wear his worth on his watch-guard. The
Rev. Nicol still preaches the Gospel. Hallelujah!
WONDERS OF THE AGE.
Why is it so many people are never satisfied ?
Their homes are marvels of comfort and luxury,
friends are generous and affectionate ; they are
educated and refined, capable, not only of enjoy-
ing, but of imparting happiness to others; yet
they are dissatisfied, miserable, and, really without
Intending to do so, make others miserable. Their
blood is impure, they have taken a heavy cold, or
they are bilious. A few doses of Emil Prese’s
Hamburg Tea would remove all obstructions, and
enable them to enjoy, with renewed zest, the plea-
sures they are now compelled to forego.

Gentlemen,—Some few weeks since I was so

rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
pain on account of severe pains in the hack; and
it had just become necessary for me to take a holi-
day from my work, for the performance of whicn
I was by no means fit, when a friend mentioned to
me the benefit he derived from the use of Ham-
burg Tea. In the hope of getting some relief, i
used It myself, the result being that I was myself
in three.or four days, and have not suffered sinee.

During the Spring
THE misery, shame, and suffering, often be-
queathed as a sole legacy to children by
parents, is neglected Scrofula. To cleanse the
blood of this hereditary poison at this season, and
thus remove the most prolific cause of human suf-
fering to clear the Skin of Disfiguring Humors,
Itching Tortures, Humiliating Eruptions, and
Loathsome Sores caused by it, to purify and beau-
tify the Skin, and restore the Hair so that no trace
of the disease remain, Cuticura Resolvent, the
new Blood Purifier, and Cuticuka and Cuticuka
Soap, the great Skin Cures and Beautlflers, are in-
fallible. The spring is the time to take them.
“ 4 FTER THREE MONTHS’ use of CUTICUKA
and twelve years of as constant
suffering from Humor of the face, neck and scalp
as was ever endured, I can say that I am cured,
and pronounce my case the most remarkable on
ecord. I have been so elated with my success, that
I have stopped men on the street who were afflicted
and told them to get the Cuticuka Remedies
and they would cure them. This is why I am so
grateful to you, for I believe them to be the best
and greatest discovery of the age, and that they will
cure all who are suffering with these diseases.”

Gentlemen, — I have
never before given a tes-
timonial,but am willing
to encourage the use of
an honest remedy. I
am so pleasedwith your
hair brush that I deem
it my duty to write you
recommending it most
cordially. My hair,
about a year since,
commenced falling
out, and I was rapid-
ly becoming bald ;
but, since using the
brush, a thick growth
of hair has made its
appearance, quite
equal to that which I
had previous to its
falling out. I have
tried other remedies
but without success.
After this remarkable
result I purchased one
for my wife, who has
been a great sufferer
from headache, and she
finds it a prompt and
infallible remedy.

VARIOUS VERSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Hymn to Humbug.
VERSES UNTO VICE.
PROFESSORS OF LITERATURE AND THEIR
LITERATURE.
Sladen has gone; but yet we can endure
His loss, and that of all his literature,
If he will but renounce in other climes
The name he borrowed hero to sell his rhymes;
And publish wide through England’s crowded
space
That New South Wales was not his native place.
’Twas bad enough when, week by week, he
showed
Stupendous ignorance, by song or ode:
Each song a slice of motric-sausage-raeat,
Made up of lines of ever-varying feet,
Contained each metre Byron ever used,
Together jumbled up in style confused.
His lofty spirit scorned with high disdain
The measured cadences of Milton’s strain:
His wholesale genius in its mighty scope
Scorning the style of Goldsmith, Gray, or Pope, ]
Whose verse unvaried to one measure chained,
From first to last the same true ring maintained,
With bolder effort strove to intersperse
All Kinds of metre in the self-same verse:
And, failing to invoke sweet concord’s aid,
A string of discords in each line displayed,
While here and there a seasoning was thrown
Of ghastly rhyme, peculiarly his own.
Yes, truly, this, per tse, was bad enough:
That he should write and Alfred print such stutf.
Vile as it was, perhaps we might excuse
His verse, had it but praised the Evening News
Or eulogised the weekly Bennett’s page,
And hailed its Alf. as wonder of the age—
Extolled its scribes, those foes to “counter
lunch,”
And howled an elegy for Sydney Punch.
For, had he sung of these, we then should deem
The bard well suited to his chosen theme,
And gladly note that by the Muse's aid
Union of kindred spirits had been made.
But, not attempting subjects such as these.
He needs must write on ev’ry place he sees;
With limping line describe the frantic joy
Which filled his soul when he reviewed FItzroy;
Tell what he felt of rapture and amaze
When Govett’s Leap first met his wondering
- gaze;
And with but poor results invoke the Muse
To tell of Rose Hill’s oak-fringed avenues.
Thus, like the snail which leaves its track of
slime,
Whate’er ho saw he marked with nauseous
rhyme;
Bestowed some metric struggle on each scone
And threw iambics at each dark ravine
(The name iambics won’t describe them quite,
But it was thus, I’m told, he meant to writeL
And with success he laboured to defile
Each mountain peak with verses worse than vile!
That made us squirm; but still the heavier blow
Was dealt by him when he essayed to show
That under far antipodean skies
A Southern sun could bid a Byron rise.
Two crafty libels thus assailed our fame—
The first, that New South Wales esteemed his
name;
The second—and this merits deeper scorn—
That ip thlaland the Bard was bred and born.
High Heaven forbid—the thought is clothed with
That men should think we love such poets here I
What streams of drivel then would flood the
town
From those who burn to win a like renown I
What reams of ravings then each English mall
Would bring consigned to Bennett or to Traill I
And grammar’s laws be slaughtered week by
In pTaise of Pinchgut, Ryde, or Tarban Creek I
Thrice Happy Sydney 1 to her shores to lure
Such mighty master of her Literature.
What shoals of Hallorans and Wyldes should
rise
When Alma Mater such a guide supplies;
So deeply skilled in all the arts of speech.
And so well fitted laws of verse to teach I
A king of Grammar heedlessly hfl rode
Rough-shod o’er all the rules of Murray’s code.
Some Latin bard or someone somewhere sings,
“ Kings rule their subjects, Jove rules even
kings;”
So here, though Syntax binds the meaner crew,
Great Sladen’s genius governs Syntax, too.
Kovolting verse, and more rebellious prose,
His rule o’er laws of language plainly shows.
It may be asked, “ If he did thus disgrace
The poet’s name, what paper gave him space ?
What Editor would willingly allot
The smallest space to such internal rot ?
Should any wish to “ know the reason why,”
The truthful rhyme can furnish this reply:
Some editors, alas! but seek to know
Whether the Bard requires a quid pro quo.
Jf he expect his song to yield him cash
At once, ’tis seen his verse is vilest trash;
If he do not, why, then, ’tis understood
That his productions must, of course, be good;
No matter what the theme or strain may be,
’Tis worth inserting if he claim no fee.
Out in the suburbs, ono may often note
Some filthy pond, where dogs distended float,
While on a board such words as these appear:
“ All sorts of rubbish may be thrown in here
Just so these editors
[81x lines excised by order. We see no parallel,
and cannot allow insulting comparisons of muck-
holes and our contemporaries to be made. We
mean, of course, insulting to our contemporaries.
—Ed. B.j
But if an editor should chance to say,
“ For all 1 took of his he got his pay,”
Deep eondemnation follows the excuse,
Which proves one lunatic, at least, let loose.
Hoi A-blg-gail, raise up your voice again.
Nor cease till he’s secured with triple chain;
But lately you were mad with rage to see
One man immured Tyho safely might be tree;
But here a nobler theme your speech may find—
A man let loose whom waistcoat straight should
bind.
If you have blown before, let hurricane
Of Eloquence now sweep the human plain;
Oive him no “ Local « >ptlou note his crime—
”Ti8 self-confessed: ‘‘ I purchased Sladen's rhyme.”

FAMOUS
NEVER previously did any piano win such a hold
on the public as the Miiraon has done since
Its introduction. Our competitors have no doubt
done their level best to rival ua-blazoning forth
their bald imitations with a tremendous flourish
of trumpets. What result have they to show,
excepting- to point to the gradual death of all their
offspring? The reason is soon found. Inferior
instruments, with showy exteriors, have been
brought forth and attempted to be foisted on the
public. But the right-thinking public will have
none of them. The consequence is that the
Sales of the Wlignon Piano
have Trebled.
THE MIGNON PIANO
has found its way into every town almost of all
the colonies—in Victoria and New South Wales,
from north to south ; to the tar north of Queens-
land ; in New Zealand, from one end to the other
of the islands. In South Australia and Tasmania
THE MIGNON
can be found, and its nafte is really a household
word.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the people’s favourite.
THE MIGNON PIANO
for its size defies all would-be imitations.
THE MIGNON PIANO
ieguaranteed to withstand any climate in Australia.
THE MIGNON PIANO
is the cheapest, because the best.
THE MIGNON PIANO
can be hadlon very easy TIME PAYMENT.
THE MIGNON PIANO
excels all similar pianos for first-class work and
richness of tone.

Rev. Father Wilds’
EXPERIENCE.
The Kev. Z. 1*. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows:
“78 E. rAih St., Xew York, May 10, 1882.
Messrs. J. C. Ayer & Co., Gentlemen ;
Last winter 1 was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor ail'ecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that 1 could scarcely bear any clothing
over them. I was also a sutfurer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and my system a gaud
deal run down. Knowing the value of
AVER’S Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. 1 feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
1 recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three times a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles. 1 place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
Yours respectfully, Z. P. Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of lire many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from impure or impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of the stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrofu-
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Rheu-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system.

Harper, a married man who a year ago
entered the service of a Waterford farmer, Richard
Dowly, and seduced his employer’s daughter, re-
cently returned, coolly asked for money, and
offered to take the girl away. Dowly seized a
hatchet, exclaiming, “ You villain, you have de-
stroyed her life, I’ll take yours,” and clove his
skull.
Captivity demoralises even the king of
beasts. At the Posen Zoological Gardens a fine
lion walked out of the door, which his keeper had
accidentally left open, and, instead of roaring
about to devour the spectators, jumped up to the
top of a tree. The branch broke, and the lion fell
and stunned himself. Then he was shut up again.
Prolonged imprisonment had muddied the poor
creature’s mind until he was not sure whether he
was a monkey or a bird.
The Echo blubbers for the preservation of
the peerage, the great nobility of England, in a
way that would draw sympathetic tears into the
eyes of Lord John Manners. “To destroy a great
institution, which is the growth of centuries, and
Interwoven with the fibres of the national exist-
ence and currents of thought, would be a world-
wide calamity,” says the Echo, in placid forget-
fulness (if it ever knew) that precisely the same
argument might be employed for leaving a cancer
untouched.
Culohaw is evidently on the spread, and
Oscar Wilde would feel at home, all over, in a
certain hotel in the North, where the high-
toned landlord moistens his hands before pulling
the poultry asunder by tho legs, and the aesthetic
landlandy, as tho breakfast plates are returned to
her, mops the gravy off each with a junk of broad,
and wrapping her alabaster jaws around the greasy
mess observes, in dulcet tones: “By Jorge, I likes
this. Gravy's the stuff wot sticks t’ yer ribs an’
fattens.” The cook up there wears brick-coloured
ringlets, and so does the butter.
“One March day,” said the venerable
Methodist divine, Bishop Pierce, of Georgia, “I
rode ten miles through a drenching rain to Flat-
rock Chapel, only to find two persons there, a man
and a boy. After waiting a few minutes, I said,
‘ We might as well leave here, as there will be no
congregation.’ But the man quietly responded,
‘ Through five miles of pelting rain I have come
to hear preaching.’ I saw my duty, and replied,
‘You are right; you are entitled to it.’ For one
hour I addressed my little congregation, and was
never listened to with more attention.”
The Economist, according to Reuter, refer-
ring to the proposals of N.S. Wales for the Issue of
fresh loans, “ ciutlcns the colony against excessive
borrowing.” How are the mighty fallen 1 Time
was when borrowing nations shivered if the Eco-
nomist frowned on their securities. Now, as the
last proved and as the present loan will do, when
Australia asks, the British capitalist pays down the
money. The caution this time is all on our side.
We could have thirty millions for the asking.
When Lord Clive was examined as to the money
he had made out of the opportunities he had in
India, and had to confess to only a moderate for-
tune, he said, “ When I think of it, sir, by God
I wonder at my own moderation.”
Why should we degrade humanity by
hanging criminals who can be painlessly killed by
anaesthetics ? At the London home for lost dogs,
Dr. Richardson has made many successful experi-
ments. A chamber was charged with carbonic
oxide, the gas having been previously passed over
a porous surfa e, from which it took up vapour
containing chloroform. Into this chamber was
introduced a cage containing so many dogs, who,
in a very short time passed from life to death in a
profound sleep, without evincing the slightest
pain or consciousness. Dr. Richardson has also
administered the same narcotising agent to sheep,
so as to allow as their being killed in a perfectly
painless manner.
When a bank clerk, who has knocked about
for years on pay less than a navvy, is “ promoted ”
to something nearly equal to that of a carrier, and
is going away, he is usually presented with a three-
und-sixpenny locket he doesn’t want, and has to
borrow bis coach fare to go up and take charge of
tens of thousands of pounds, and learn tho private
affairs of the bank customers. When a manager
loaves, they give him a purse of sovereigns ho
doesn’t need. It would be interesting, however,
to know how many of those gushing testimonialists
have tender recollections of si rained overdrafts
quietly winked at. No human being ever felt such
effusive admiration for a man as those addresses
imply, unless there had been a good many “quid”
pro quo.
Not long ago, a certain Irish militia regi-
ment was drawn up on parade, awaiting tho
colonel's inspection. One by one the companies
were brought to “attention” by their captains,
until it came to No. 3 Company, the captain of
which had had a serious misunderstanding with
his tenantry on the subject of rents. No word was
given, consequently the company remained stand-
ing “at ease.” Up rode the adjutant, furiously.
“Captain O’Ballyuoodle, why the deuce don't you
call your company to ‘attention?’” No answer.
“ Will you call them to ‘ attention ’ sir ?” screamed
the adjutant, now purple with rage. At this
juncture tho colour-sergeant solemnly stepped
out, and addressing the adjutant, said; “Av yer
plase, sorr, tho captain and his company are not on
sphaking terms.”
Our old friend, Mr. Richard Anthony
Proctor, has got hold of “a wholesale price-list
of some firm of distillers, which reveals a secret
of the trade. In this document occurs the follow-
ing passage, under the head of ‘Spirit Flavours’:
• The attention of consumers (surely they meant
‘sellers’) in Australia and India is particularly
called to these very useful and excellent flavours.
One pound jof either of these essences to fifty
gallons of plain spirit will make Immediately a fine
brandy or Old Tom, &c., without tho use of a still.’
This is followed by a list of prices of these
* flavours,’ and then follows a similar one of ‘ Wine
Aromas.’ This is decidedly a lively look-out for
travellers, ispecially for those who have a pre-
ference tor certain vintages.’’ But the English
spirit-dealers cun t teach much to tho back-block
and back-slum whisky-mill proprietors, who al-
ready know too well not only how to make grog,
but how to make it “ bite all the way down.”
Asks Bishop Barry ‘ Can anyone ima-
gine Jesus Christ sending his apostles through
Jerusalem so bedizened, or tolerating the kind of
testimonies and the scenes of uproar which are
permitted, and even encouraged, at many meet-
ings of the Salvation Army ? This question of
the above-named Right Reverend Father in God
raises a whole host of similar questions. This, for
exampleCan anyone Imagine Jesus Christ
sending his apostles through Jerusalem bedizened
in the garb of an Anglican prelate when got. up in
full fig, or tolerating those exchanges of acidities,
and those scenes of uproar which are the almost
invariable characteristics of the meetings of
Synods?" But ’tis the never-failing mark of the
hierarchs of all the so-called Christian sects, each
separate crowd for its own little ring, “ to be quite
persuaded that the apostles would have done as
they did.” If they cherished these delusions at
their own charges 'twouldn t be much harm; as it
is, ’tis (as regards mischief) about six of one and
half-a-dozen of the others.
This is in Christian London—London, that
for hundredsof years nas held innumerable mltr.d
heads, and whose highest monuments and most
magnificent pageants have been associated with
the sacred symbol; London, the centre from which
anti-slavery radiated, and from which to-day issue
the missionaries of peace ana good-will to every
land. Cardinal Manning, preicning for the Uni-
versity Hospital, said that "it would be believed
that Our Lord, who, in His pity and love, wept
over the city of Jerusalem, has abundantly wept
over the sin, the misery, and the death of London,
He could conceive no more ghasily vision than tho
amount of sin and mortality that is to be found in
the city where they dwelt. Every year, some
seventy or eighty thousands go up before the
Judgment Sear, and how many there are unat-
tended by priest or physician God only knows”
If we read the Christian code aright, and recall
the innumerable array of professed teachers of the
yeligion of Christ who have dwelt there, but who
now figure dimly down the long scroll as self-
seeking, gluttonous disturbers of the peace, the
unflinching opponents of human liberty of
thought and the grovelling upholders of ancient
abuses, and then finish the list with the names of
saints in our own day who roll in the ill-gotten
wealth that comes as rent from known tenements
of disease and vice, “a ghastlier vision ” awaits
tne Cardinal, if there be any Judgment. Other-
wise, wt see no purpose in holding it.
A large number of lives have been saved
at English fires lately by the “jumping-sheet,” a
piece of the strongest sail-cloth, about 10ft. by 8ft.
Its edges are bound over a stout rope, and at short
intervals round it there is a rope handle, or
“becket.” At the London fire-brigade head-
quarters there is a flrst-fioor window, the sill of
which is perhaps 30ft. from the ground, and from
this every recruit in his turn has to leap, while his
comrades hold out the sheet over the flagstones
beneath. Twenty feet, It may be thought, is no
great leap, but many of the men, all of whom, it
may be observed, have been sailors, find this leap
a really trying ordeal for their nerves, and this is
one of the exercises at which mishaps have been
most frequent. At the old head-quarters, a jump
of 30ft. used to be taken, but this was found to be
fraught with serious danger, and was abandoned.
Even with twenty feet some men are very ner-
vous. They get excited about it, and instead of
jumping into the middle of the sheet, they come
down near the edge, thus bringing the worst of
the fall on to one or two pairs of hands. Occa-
sionally men cannot overcome their nervous
tremours, and after repeated trials still betray ex-
citement. In such cases it is deemed inexpedient
to retain them as recruits, and they have to bo
dismissed. The object of this exercise is to give
the men practice, not only In the rescue of the
Inmates of houses in flames, but in escaping them-
selves, should they ever be in a position from
which they could be rescued by no other means.
It says a great deal for the elaborate care with
which every possibility of a chance of rescue is
provided for that this drill is kept up year after
year, and fire-escapes always provided with a
sheet, although, as a matter of experience, it Is
seldom in demand.
Laycock, who was hanged 26 th August for
murdering- his wife and four children at Sheffield,
said he “didn’t want a reprieve. His heart was
lighter then that it had been since he was a child.”
In a letter to his mother-in-law, he says:—“ I have
Placed myself in God’s hands, and look to Him lor
orglveness, and trusting that my fate will be the
cause of leading others in the right path. I with a
free heart forgive my wife for all her bad doings,
and I pray to God for her forgiveness, trusting
that I may also receive the same, that in a very
short time I hope to meet them all in heaven, and
my dear children, whom I dearly loved to my
heart. You must not fret about me. I am not
afraid to die. I am fully prepared to meet my
ray Maker in heaven. Oh, how happy it is to die
with a cheerful heart, but what makes it cheerful
is to bo prepared to meet our God, where there is
no more sorry, no more payne, nothink but happi-
ness. Oh, think of this; let it change your hearts
from evil ways, and take my advice for once, let
me beg and pray of you all. Well, I think 1 have
said all this time, trusting that you will come and
see me, and may God bless and protect you all
from the wickedness of this world.” Mr. Haycock,
who, being safely in gaol, has dared to speak
slightingly of his late wife to his mother-in-law
e vidently looks back on his career with satisfaction.
The view he takes of the awful crimes he has
committed differs only in degree from that taken
by many ocher culprits of very low mental organi-
sation. He has turned his home into a slaughter-
house for all who had any claim upon his affection,
yet now he assumes the office of an adviser during
his last hours in secular as well as spiritual matters.
He has butchered his own unoffending little ones,
but when his sister visited him in his ceil at Leeds
he thought that his advice as to how she should
treat her little boy would be valuable. “ Ho not
thrash him, but talk kindly to him ” he urged,
with an earnestness which was posssibly not simu-
lated. He cut the heads off his four infants, and
therefore considers himself quite an authority on
the proper way of treating children. He says not
one word about remorse. Ou the other hand, he
tries to justify the killing of his wife by stating
that she slapped him on the face in the street and
pulled his ears. He ventures to tell his mother-in
law “ with a free heart ” that he “ forgives his wife
for all her bad deed's,” and he will “pray for her
forgiveness” in another world. He evidently
thinks his murdered wife is by far the greater
culprit of the two, and he now expects for him-
self “nothing but happiness.” What a queer
world this is!
Everybody knows that the Melbourne
Daily Telegraph is a religious paper. Even
without seeing the editor on his knees with his
hands joined supplicating for the staff an enlight-
enment from above to make up for the short
supply of cablegrams the proprietary afford, the
religious character of the journal can be dis-
covered. It manifests itself by the way in which
it serves up and gloats upon any little giddiness
that goes on between the boys and girls in the
narks. That is always the test-point in a paper.
If it gives the item in a brief, newsj style, it is a
common secular rag; but if it puts the item
standing up, ogles it, licks its lips at it, goes back-
wards to scan it at a distance, steps near to
examine the joints, touches it, tickles it, walks
ar< und it, then sets it on its head and goes afresh
through the whole performance about the other
end of it, you may step into the witness-box and
swoar on the calf-skin that it is a truly religious
newspaper. Well, the Daily Telegraph had a
man with a juvenile face and a white hat in the
Town Hall gallery when the Victorian natives
met on the 23nd to champion federation and annex-
ation. This personage was not a mere reporter.
His duty was to absorb the spirit of the meeting,
to cjtch its enthusiasm, as it were, and return to
the .office primed to discharge a volleying leader.
That was enterprising onjthe part of the D.T., and
an admirable “leader” would probably have
been the result if the paper were not a pro-
nouncedly religious one. Under the guidance of
its religious spirit, hero is how he broke forth:
“If eonvictism produced such offspring as filled
the Town Hall last night, well, we should hug ov/r
ancestry in the face of the world.” ,Thinkof it!
Why Tom Moore gibbeted a youth who only hugged
his grandmother. But where can we get sarcasm
enough for the man who would set out to hug his
whole ancestry? Pooh! A man with such a
penchant for hugging is a menace to the commu-
nity. But, then, he is a religious man. And we
are used to wholesale hugging from religious men.
Here are some tiger stories for Mr. [nglis.
A tiger was, the other day, shot in an Indian tele-
graph office. To quote the official report of the
native clerk-in-charge, the brute, which was
“ three yards in length and about a yard and a
third or more in height, “had been prowling round
the office all day, and when his retreat was cut off
by men on one side and a train on the other, Mr.
Tiger “ all of a sudden jumped over the fencing
wire and entered my office, and jumping over the
ticket cupboard took his seat thereupon. I got
the doors locked up Immediately, not allowing
him to come outside again. The country gun was
ready again, and the post-office superintendent
took it; and, since there were no bullets here at
the time, four copper coins, broken into sixtee
pieces, were all oaded into the gun, with gun-
powder. During the interval, the tiger twice took
a walk over the booking-office counter, but, seeing
no way out, he again took his seat on the same cup-
board.” And here he was shot “ by the post-office
superintendent, with t-e gun prepared as afore-
said.” The clerk concludes his report with a pet -
tion for “two guns, for our protection from tigers.”
And, not Iona ago, a tiger wandered into a village,
and after spending much of the night in walking
about on the roofs of the houses, looking in at the
sleeping inmates, like another Dialle Boiteux, he
must needs jump down through a sky-l'ght into
an empty room. Unable to get out he began roar-
ing, to the prodigious consternation of the in-
mates, who thought the devil had arrived. By
and bye, his majesty of the jungle in his desperate
efforts at release, fell through the floor, and
“ cleared ” jby the front door. On another occa-
sion, a tiger hearing, for the first time in his life,
the voices of some ducks in a wicker-work ham-
per, must needs creep into the camp to investigate
the strange things that made such queer noises,
and, smelling that they were good to eat, forced
*ts head through the wicker-work and could not
withdraw It. The ducks, of course, lifted up their
voices with redoub'ed vehemence, and the more
the tiger shook his head, with the hamper fast
on it, the more the poultry clamoured. Dread-
fully bothered by the predicament, the tiger
tried to bolt, but with his head in a hamper
full of terrified ducks he could not see his way,
and, after blundering about among the tents
for a while, was ignominiously slain. Again,
near Calcutta, a scientific Baboo had put up
a rain-gauge. A tiger wandering into the neigh-
bourhood saw it, and went up in order to find out
what the mysterious thing might be. Finding
water in it, he began to drink, and as the liquid
sank he pushed his head farther and farther into
the funnel. A sudden noise startled him. It was
the worthy Baboo coming out to register the
rainfall, But what was his dismay when he saw a
tiger bounding about his garden with the rain-
gauge fitted on to its head. The unhappy animal
roared out, but its own voice, sounding so
strangely cavernous within the metal tube, was
enough to increase its terror, and, while the mad-
dened beast went bounding round and round,
“ with a hollow voice of roaring,’’ the Baboo got a
rifle and shot it. We ourselves have never seen a
tiger in a telegraph office. But we have seen many
tigresses. Just you try to hurry up a lady tele-
graph-clerk in London while she is talking to her
‘ mash.”
The burning question of the present day is
this. Will the coming man “smoke” his mother?
We rather thing he will. And for good, substan-
tial damages, too. Because, there comes a tale
from Yermont which tells of a boy, Peter Rass-
mussen by name, over whose bald head three
summers have barely passed, and who began his
journey through life on his hands, circus fashion.
Every effort to compel Peter to use his legs natur-
ally was made by his distressed parents, but with-
out success. When his rubber ring rolls away
from his grasp, Peter at once “ reverses his poles,”
as Professor Edison would say, hoists himself up
on his hands, and moves after his play-tov. On
reaching it, he grasps it between his feet, and
marches back on his paws the way he started. The
only explanation given for this eccentricity on the
part of Master Rassmussen is that of his mother,
who says she attended a circus about three and a
half years ago—shortly before Peter was born, in
fact—at which the wonderful acrobatic perform-
ances of a wall-eyed Mongolian contortionist by
the name of Kitchi Li Hung made an exceedingly
strong impression on her mind. So strong, in fact,
did her memory hang on to Li Hung that she was
continually dreaming about men walking round
on their hands, and upon several occasions she
nearly scared the soul out of old Mr. Rus-
mussen himself by some surprisingly wonderful
exhibitions of ground and lofty tumbling at mid-
night’s silent hour. What makes the trouble all
the more serious is that Peter’s complexion is de-
cidedly butter-coloured already: the heel part of
his eyebrows is gradually crawling up to the top
corners of his forehead, he talks in a foreign tongue,
has a morbid longing for stinking fish, and, in short,
is rapidly developing into a second edition of the
boneless Kitchi Li Hung himself. Old Mr. Rass-
oaussen can’t account for the thing at all. None
of his previous children ever acted thus, and he
has no theory whatever to fit the case- We are,
therefore, compelled to accept the circus account
of the phenomenon as given by Peter’s fond Mama.
\.nd this brings us face to face with the startling
fact that our future lives are entirely dependant
on the style of amusement affected by our mothers
before our birth. A child may be endowed with
the genius of a Shakspeare, but if his maternal
parent had a weakness for wild beast shows prior
co his introduction to this world that child would,
according to Mrs. Rassmussen’s theory, develop a
tail and spendlthe bulk of his existence following
hand-organs round the streets or squatting down
on the roof-tops for the purpose of studying ento-
nology in his various stages. If, on the other
hand, the misguided woman should be unduly
addicted to attending political meetings she would
undoubtedly give to the world a hatchet-faced man
who’d be continually nosing about to select land
along secretly projected railway routes, or trot-
ting round departmental back stairs to secure
Government billets for the whole of his dead-beat
relations. Then, again, the mother of the coming
man might have a weakness for the society of
uarsons of the extremely Free Church order; and
it would assuredly follow that her son, even
though he were a second Joseph by nature, would
still feel inclined to cry “ rest thee, rest thee,” to
every honest woman he met as he took her on his
knee and began to tell her all about what Paul
said to the Californians, even as the good Vic-
torian shepherd is alleged to have done «t Wim-
mera. Or, supposing the expectant mother had a
penchant for picnics, the result would be that—
well, parsons are bad enough, perhaps, so we’ll
draw the line at picnics. Enough has been said,
however, to show that the coming man’s prospects
in life are entirely ruled by the previous re-
creations of his mother, and, if it can be proved
that she exhibited malice, or undue carelessness
in the choice of her amusements prior to his birth,
he certainly has very good grounds for entering
an action for substantial damages against her. [As
we go to press we regret to learn that old Mr.
Rassmussen, after publicly declaring his wife’s
theory was all roseate “rot,” broke both Master
Rassmussen’s arms with a crow-bar, and is now
searching round for Mr. Kitchi Li Hung with a
double-barrelled howitzer.— Ed. B.]
A pretty toilet is here shown, composed of pale-blue silk with mousseline de-laine
top. The underskirt is made with three pinked out flounces, headed with a broad
gathering which is half hidden by the long drapery. The front part of the upper
skirt and the short basque at the back are trimmed with fine cream Spanish lace.
