The Lessons of Mount Rennie.
In choosing such a subject, and departing
from the stereotyped method of treatment,
there is always the risk of being mi r under-
stood. The person who raises his voice
against the operation of barbarous laws and
in favour of enlightened ones, must be pre-
pared to have his views questioned and his
motives misrepresented and caricatured, lie
is pourtrayed either as a dangerous visionary
or as an active sympathiser with crime, lie
becomes a target for the dull platitudes of
the great dunce family, a mark for the
clumsy ridicule of the self-righteous. Maud-
lin f sentimentalism,” “ mawkish philan-
thropy,” and similar well-worn catch-words
from the vocabulary of abuse are fired at
him from pulpit and from press. In this
connection we would seriously suggest to
those able persons who, in the daily leading
article, the weekly sermon, and the occa-
sional address from the Bench, say so rnuclr
that is not new when true, nor true when
new, that it would be judicious to choose
fresh adjectives to strengthen their argu-
ments, as “mawkish,” “maudlin,” and a
few more of that class have done such good
service in the cause as to be fairly entitled
to a little rest. Barren as our tongue is in
synonyms it is not so barren as to deny
appropriate, ones to those writers or speakers
who desire to give a well-earned repose to a
few words whose original vigour has been
sadly marred by long ill-use and over-woik.
Ever since the Times, many years ago, used
the word “maudlin” to designate the in-
decent squeamishness of those who considered
it iniquitous to force opium on the Chinese
at the bayonet’s point, these unfortunate
adjectives have not had a moment to them-
selves when savage laws had to be passed or
barbarous punishments inflicted.
♦ * *
Communities lose their heads like indivi-
duals. It is then that true citizenship is
shown in reasoning with wild national im-
pulses instead of blindly following them.
Twenty-five years ago a thrill of pleasure
ran through England as J efferson Dav is
drove home the wedge that was to split the
Union. The prospect of two jealous and
hostile Republics on the North American
continent was pleasant to those who watched
the growth of Democracy with no friendly
eyest No doubt the triumph of the South
meant the perpetuation of Slavery—its
victory the defeat of humanity. But wdiat
was freedom or humanity to the Times, the
Saturday Review, or the descendants of
those sprightly ladies the way to whose
chamber doors was as well known to the
handsome Jack Churchills of the time
as to the Stuarts ? When Bright
stood up to tell the English people
the true state of affairs, to explain to them
that the cause of the North meant progress
and of the South retrogression, he was be-
spattered with vituperative mud. Grave
prelates turned away their heads ; learned
judges frowned on the unpatriotic tribune ;
Tory editors shook their rattles in his face
and expressed fear lest some wicked people
might put him under the pump. It was
precisely the same when Romilly and
Brougham thundered against the penal
laws that were the scandal of Europe. The
Bench of bishops shot out the tongue and
damned in dainty English the proposals
to regenerate society by means of the
school-house instead of the gallows. The
progeny of the Cecils, the Churchills, the
Cavendishes, and the Fitzroys, could not
repress their laughter at the idea of govern-
ing without wdiipping naked women at the
cart’s tail. Even with us at this end of the
world the position of the reformer, or of him
who struggles against a burst of popular un-
reason, is not without its drawbacks. The
opinion is now all but universal that the N.S.
Wales expedition to the Soudan was “a
blunder worse than a crime.” But when a
citizen ascended a Sydney platform early last
year to explain how foolish, wicked, and
supererogatory the project was, the appear-
ance of his coat and hat after a short argu-
ment proved the impolicy of obstruction and
die strength of the popular voice.
* * *
And so to our text. The cry for blood
that went up from the Bench has been
echoed by the press. A perusal of recent
leading articles would lead one to suppose
that the crime of rape was peculiar to N.S.
Wales, and unknown beyond its borders.
Yet the offence, in its worst form, is scarcely
known in the colony. One never hears of
the forcible defilement of chaste and circum-
spect women. The Mount Ronnie case is no
exception. The outrage usually springs from
a drunken orgie participated in by lewd men
and women as lewd, N ewspapers spread the
opinion that the proper treatment for such
men is to wipe them out of existence. If
under such a regimen the offence disappeared
there would be nothing to urge against the
gallows. But the lesson taught by universal
experience is that neither this nor
any other description of crime can be
eradicated by such means. Indeed, advanced
thinkers have long since abandoned the idea
of putting down crime entirely, and now
content themselves with the humble task of
conlining it within the narrowest limits. On
one thing they are agreed it is the certainty
of detection rather than the severity of
punishment that tends to check wrongdoing.
It is not what he will suffer if found out, but
the chances in favour of escaping, that sways
the criminal. And yet so peculiarly are
some men’s minds constituted that even
when detection is certain and punishment
severe, given but the opportunity and the
crime will follow". With the assurance that
discovery must take place a clerk makes a
false entry, daily attends his office, and
chats daily with his fellows. So far as he is
individually concerned it matters little
whether the penalty extends over a week or
over a life-time. The chance comes in his
way and he takes it. It was the same with
the Mount Rennie satyrs and with the others
mentioned by the presiding judge. Would
the knowledge that death was the penalty
have had any effect ? Those know little of
human nature who think so.
* * »
Owing to the early circumstances of N.S.
Wales the feeling among the ruling classes
in favour of capital and of corporal punish-
ment is still strong. The idea that but for
the rope and the cat-o’-nine-tails society
would fall to pieces, has a firm hold on the
colonial mind. If it could be shown that
with the gibbet and the triangles we would
have ten murders and ten rapes in the year,
while without them but five of each offence
would occur, there are legislators and judges
among us who would prefer to hang and flog
and put up with the ten extra outrages.
Colonial judges are seldom men of wide
sympathies or of profound acquaintance with
subjects lying outside their profession. In-
deed, their views on some important matters
are rather mirth-provoking than otherwise.
This was well shown recently by the pam-
phlets of two Victorian Judges, and the
speech of a New South Wales one. Speech
and publications dealt with some of the theo-
logical questions which during the past 2000
years men have been in the habit of discuss-
ing when they had nothing else to do. To
the reader acquainted with the attitude of
the best European thought towards these
subjects, there was something almost gro-
tesque in the efforts made by the speaker to
infuse fresh life into the moribund beliefs,
and by the writers to attract attention to
their elementary scepticism. Judges cannot
learn too soon that when they choose to
circulate their views by means of words
written or spoken they must submit to
criticism like meaner citizens. Their posi-
tion gives them no right to expect the ac-
quiescence of thoughtful men in their exploded
dogmas,ortheirmildcoquettings with unbelief.
As for the Victorian Judges, their pamphlets
were about as interesting as a lecture on long
division would be to a class of Cambridge
Wranglers.
# *
Considering all the circumstances, it is
doubtful whether, outside of Australia, there
exists a country w T here such sentences would
be passed or such demands be made to carry
them out. It may be, of course, that Aus-
tralia is wiser than the rest of the world,
but then the opposite opinion is also tenable.
The wisdom of employing torture at all is,
after centuries of trial, denied by the leading
nations. The practice of combining it with
life-long imprisonment is peculiarly Austra-
lian. When the British army and navy w ere
at their worst, when on the barrack-square
and the quarter-deck, the swish of the lash
was heard from morning till night, corporal
punishment and penal servitude never w ent
together. Such a combination was seen to
be so meaningless and wanton in its savagery
as to find no advocates. But it is a favourite
plan with us. The regret of Judge Windeyer
that the wretch Sweetman was not in better
health that he might bo able to bear more
stripes is worthy only of Patagonia. It will
be remembered how Gulliver, placed upon
the King of Brobdignag’s palm, strutted
with pride as he bawded into his Majesty’s
ears of European conspiracies in the palace
and prowess in the field. We can imagine the
dwarfish traveller’s surprise when instead of
expressing admiration the king replied —we
quote from memory —“ From what you say,
friend Gulliver, I fancy thatyourpeoplemust
be about the meanest lot of vermin that ever
crawled on the earth.” Some years ago the
officials of the Melbourne gaol showed the
officers of an Italian man-of-w r ar through
their establishment and among other things
exhibited the scourges and explained the use
of the triangles. Instead of admiration the
foreigners—citizens of a country wherein
even Passanante, who wounded King Hum-
bert with intent to kill him, was not put to
death —were filled with loathing for a people
who could thus glory in their shame. On
their return to Italy a book was published
in which scathing allusions were made to the
Victorian method of treatment. At the last
elections, when a prominent member was
asked his opinion on flogging he naively said
that the punishment should be administered
when deserved. The answer was considered
satisfactory. Had breaking on the wheel or
crucifixion been in vogue the same reply
would serve the purpose.
* * *
Just as the decline of barbarous punish-
ments is the sign of a nation’s advance, so
their growth is a sure symptom of a people’s
decay. Much of the crime in New South
Wales is directly traceable to the ferocity of
former laws. To cure the criminal tendency,
then, by the very means that caused it, is
marvellous if only as an example of folly.
Next to the crime at Mount Rennie there is
plenty of cause for national humiliation to
be found in various parts of the address
from the Bench and in all parts of the yells
sent up by the newspapers for triangles and
blood. The manner in which the prisoners
were brought one by one before the unfor-
tunate woman did not give them a fair
chance for their lives. 1 hey should have
been in company with men who were known
not to have been present at the outrage.
Had some of the jury, or even the judge
himself, been treated similarly it is by no
means certain that the girl in her bewilder-
ment would not have fixed upon them also.
The manner of their trial, during which
judge and jury sat one day eighteen and a
half hours, and next day fourteen hours,
counsel rising to address the jury at 3 o’clock
in the morning, was a disgrace'to civilisation.
One thing at all events is certain. If this pack
of degraded boys are all hanged, or, in lieu of
that, flogged at intervals, murder and rape will
probably go hand in hand in the future.
And if, after the capital punishment or the
torture, one or more of them should be
proved innocent—a possibility far from re-
mote—the increase of crime may be looked
for with tolerable certainty.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Wrecks and Recklessness.
Wrecks are stock subjects of conversation in
these Eastern colonies of Australia. They are the
absorbing “Eastern Question” of Australasia.
The interest aroused by one disaster has barely
subsided before the telegram announcing another
gives an excuse for sensational “ special editions
lescribing a collision at 9 p.m. as “an appalling
midnight catastrophe,” and then the series of
narrative, inquest, inquiry, subscription, and
sometimes trial, has to be gone through: and be-
fore the facts of one wreck have lost their vivid
interest another chapter in the page of marine
disaster is begun. It may be said with absolute
certainty that although the coast between Mel-
bourne and Brisbane is the safest in the world,
both as regards weather and reefs, and the steamers
equal in seagoing qualities to any of similar size
afloat, the per centageof loss of vessels, and of lives
of passengers, are both higher than on any coast
under heaven. The reason of this is obvious.
Nine out of ten of the wrecks and disasters that
have taken place within the last ten years on this
Eastern sea board are directly traceable to the
gross carelessness of someone concerned with the
vessel’s navigation. And this carelessness is al-
most solely referable to the want of natural dan-
gers on the track. The cupidity of directors
prompts captains to do a lot of “ cornpr-cutting,”
and the depth of water round these “corners”
leads to fatal carelessness in presuming on the ad-
vantages which Nature has afforded. To a compe-
tent ’captain, navigation between Brisbane and
Melbourne is mere child’s play : he usually has
steam-stearing gear on his vessel, and the rocks of
the coast go do wnlike a wall. So,if conceited he shows
off his ability to gaping landsmen. He runs his
vessel close enough to the Seal Rocks to admit of
seal-shooting ; he goes through the South Solitary
passage when there is evident danger in the
act; and on rounding other points he is proud of
being able to do so, “ inside of a quarter of a
mile.” Nautical skylarking goes before a ship-
wreck, Some day a little less than the usual skill
is employed, and then a coroner finds the necessity
of collecting a j ury. Anyone who has travelled
much on the Australian coast is not surprised
that disasters occur so often ; his marvel is that
they come so seldom. It is only a few months
since a captain took his vessel through the South
Passage of Moreton Bay, although this had been
declared too dangerous for navigation months
before, in order to get to Sydney before a
faster vessel, which kept the safe track.
Three times his ship struck, but each time was
lifted off by the succeeding wave. Quite recently,
too, captains have sailed their vessels “ three
times round ” others in brutal exultation at pos-
sessing faster ships. These are the incidents
that precede murderous wrecks. It is too early
yet to assert the immediate causes leading to the
Corangamite or Keilawarra disasters, but it is
perfectly certain that human error, not the forces
of nature, was responsible in both cases. So with
nearly all the rest of that dreary and shame-
ful catalogue of wrecks. For a vessel to be
lost by stress of weather as in the case
of the Dandenong, is the rare exception ; the
rule is that, as in the case of the Cahors, or,
worse still, the Ly-ee-Moon, lives are sacrificed
and property lost at sea by gross negligence and
criminal carelessness. When human skill and
science are conquered by main force of the ele-
ments one can but grieve at the record of those lost
in the defeat, but when lives are thrown away by
the man to whose care they are entrusted grief is
forgotten in anger. The only remedy is in the
hands of owners and directors of the various com-
panies. If they retain officers on their steamers
who are known to be “flash” and careless by
turns, disaster will certainly follow. It is useless
to blame that useless sham, the New South Wales
Marine Board ; they don’t appoint officers and
have no control over them until a smash comes.
Hitherto the A. B.N. Company have had a mono-
poly of wrecks on the East Coast trade ; now
Messrs. Huddart, Parker, and Co., and
Howard Smith and Co. have followed the evil
example. If this is a sign that the directorate of
those companies have started to follow the policy
of the ill-starred Sydney company they would
profit by observing that company’s fate and that
of so many of their passengers.
Chief Justice Darley and His Model.
It is curious to note that Mr. Darley at the re-
cent s rearing-in ceremony discarded the idea of
folowing in the footsteps of Ids predecessors, Sir
James Martin and Sir Alfred Stephen, as a
perfectly hopeless project. “ When I contemplate
their careers,” he said, “my heart sinks within
me.” But his Honor was inspired by quite a
different sentiment when he came to speak of Sir
Matthew Hale, a Chief Justice who flourished
in the reign of King Charles 11. He quoted at
length the “ things” this jndge declared “neces-
sary to he continually held in remembrance,” ap-
proved of a dictum to the effect that these
“ things” ought to he inscribed in letters of gold
on the walls of Westminster Hall, and finally
promised to bear these rules of conduct perenni-
ally in mind and to pray for Divine help to obey
them. Nevertheless a perusal of Sir Matthew
Hale’s rules of conduct serves mostly to induce
a shuddering recollection of copybook exercises.
He begins by affirming that in the administration
of justice he was “ entrusted fjr Cod, the King,
and country, and, therefore, that it bo done up-
rightly, deliberately, resolutely.” He then lays it
down for himself “ that I rest not upon my own
understanding or strength, but implore and rest
upon the direction and strength of God.” This
sounds veil, but we cannot forget that our friends
of antiquity had a weakness for throwing the re-
sponsibility of their actions—bad, good, and in-
different —always upon the unfortunate Deity.
An Archbishop of Toledo is said to have fasted
and prayed three whole days and nights with the
view of obtaining “the direction and strength of
God,’’the result being a terrible auto-da-fe; andtheie
was a good deal of preliminaryprayingon the eve of
that awful Bartholomew’s Day. Even this very
Sir Matthew Hale showed by his performances,
that his pious assertion about imploring God for
direction and strength was vain and bootless.
Take one remarkable incident in his career. In
the spring of 1661 this judge went on circuit to
Bury St. Edmunds. There was great commotion
among the local ecclesiastics, and numerous
prayers were offered, asking for Divine aid in be-
half of the matters to be tried. It is d that
Sir Matthew Hale “demeaned with marvel-
lous devotion, and humbly prayed God to
graciously yield him insight of the business he
might have in hand, so to judge and determine
them as to lead to the glory of God, and the well-
being of the King.” The most important trial was
that of two widows who W'ere charged wit h witch-
craft. It was alleged that these women were re-
sponsible for certain ills that had befallen two
little girls, and that devilry was at the bottom of
it. The evidence went to show that the Devil was
remarkably subtle in his methods, and that The
children had swallowed some pins. Sir Matthew
Hale did not even go over the evidence to the
jury. But, as the historian soys, “ only this he ac-
quainted them : that they had two things to inquire
after. First, whether or no these children were
bewitched ; secondly, whether the prisoners at
the bar were guilty of it.” His Lordship then
proceeded to say : —“ That there were such crea-
tures as witches he made no doubt at all. For,
first, the Scriptures had affirmed so much ;
secondly, the wisdom of all nations had provided
laws against such persons, which is an argument
of their confidence of such a crime. And such
hath been the judgment of this kingdom, which
hath provided punishments proportionable to the
quality of the offence.” He then beseeched them
‘ strictly to observe their evidence, and desired
the great God of Heaven to direct their hearts in
this weighty thing they had in hand. For,” he
added, “ to condemn the innocent and to let the
guilty go free were both an abomination to the
Lord.” This was the charge'of Chief Justice
Barley’s beau ideal of a>judge. The verdict
was in accordance, whereat Sir Matthew was
fully satisfied,” and the were indue
course executed —probably burnt at the stake.
The narrator of this striking episode in the life
of Sir Matthew Hale does not neglect to tell
how a certain Serjeant Keeling, who chanced to
be present, “seemed much unsatisfied with the
evidence, and thought it not sufficient to convict
the prisoners.” “For,” Serjeant Keeling
argued, ‘ ‘ even admitting that the childmr.are in
truth bewitched, yet it can never be applfalt to the
prisoners upon the imagination only of the parties
afflicted.” However, thelearned Sir Matthew
thought differently, and simply urged the women
to confess their evil transactions with Satan, ad-
monishing them that confession and repentance
then and there might save their souls from ever-
lasting perdition. This is a typical excerpt from
the record of that Chief Justice whom Mr. Darley
has pledged himself to copy as nigh as he can.
The outlook is not very hopeful. 'I he same
pandering to vulgar prejudice and superstition is
presented to the mind as a by no means improb
able fulfilment of the promise avowed. The very
suggestion of a witchcraft prosecution in these
days is unspeakably absurd, but the Judge
who goes back to an age when such
fooleries were dominant for a pattern for
imitation is not likely to take thato-bfoad, en-
lightened, Nineteenth-Century view of analogous
matters so plainly demanded by the age. The N. S. W.
Criminal Law Consolidation Act provides punish-
ments in respect of numerous offences scarcely
less monstrous than the ancient method of dealing
with old women suspected of being in' league
with the devil. By virtue of that extraordinary
enactment there are nearly a score of crimes
punishable with death : while the lash can bejn-
flicted (even, in some cases, without trial by juryt
for comparatively venial infringements of the
law. In these circumstances the presence on the
bench of a Chief Justice imbued with respect, not
for the sapience that satisfied the good folk of
Charles ll.’s time, but for the most advanced
thought of this current era, would seem to be a
desideratum of the first magnitude. Possibly
when Mr. Darley discovers that his adoration
for the blind slave of a superstitious and ignorant
age is not shared by the public, he will cast about
for a new model. The sooner he does so the
better for the progress of the country.
Alger Bunyard, who was sentenced by Judge
Docker to ten years’ imprisonment, has had the
sentence commuted to three years. This result is
chiefly owing to the personal activity of Mr. J. M.
Curtis, who in one sense may therefore be re-
garded as a “Docker” of hard sentences. But
this is trivial and by the way. What we wanted
to point out to his Honor is that this commutation
amounts to a vote of censure on his own conduct,
and would most fitly be met by a request for
leave of absence. Judge Docker should go for a
long holiday. He should take the European trip
with Judge Win dryer, for whose society he is


admirably suited. Such similarity of taste an
thought is seldom seen, and a tour in compan;
would be a foretaste of elysium to each of them
They oould compare sentences and recapitula
the admirable, if occasionally tedious, advice the
have at various times given to prisoners whoi
juries have recommended to mercy, and migh
even work together in their spare hours for th
production of a book to be called—say, “ Feurtee
Years and the Cat as an Incentive to Holiness,
“Sinners I Have Sentenced,” “Sermons to Con
victs,” or “Mercy the Sign of Lunacy.” W
merely suggest these titles in a kindly spirit
others of a similar character will readily sugges
themselves. And if their Honors should decid
to exhibit their popular smiles under foreig
skies, we would further suggest that as trave
enlarges the mind they should travel as soon am
as far as possible. And as long.

That Cardinal Moran is unfit for his position
has long been abundantly clear to all except hi
own particular crowd. His zeal is bigotry am
his enthusiasm an offence. Just now he is pain
fully prominent in the daily papers. At first 1m
raised the green flag in an attack upon Mr. Goon
let, asserting that that gentleman, under the
garb of charity, was proselytising adherents of the
Romanist faith—alluring them to his own private
hospital by saying that it was a non-sectarian in-
stitution, and then refusing to permit them to see
a priest. This complaint having been proved to
be utterly baseless, he proceeds to make similar
charges against the Sydney Ueaf and Dumb
Asylum. Whether these latter charges are
true or not is still doubtful. The evidence
consists so far of bald assertions and flat
denials, but in any case the Cardinal does
not show well in the affair. His charges are
made in a manner calculated to arouse bitter
sectarian hatred, and are disfigured by vulgar
abuse indicative more of animus than of religious
emotion. Bigotry has been given a new lease of
life by the Cardinal’s action, and he
slaids discredited by the proved falseness of his
mat charge. If, instead of raising the green flag
of scctarianism’Jin this matter, he had employed
his spare time in explaining what has become of
the money subscribed for Archbishop Vaughan’s
burial it would have been better for himself, It's
Church, and his people.
A ROMANCE OF THE LASH.
This article is written not with the hope
of redressing an injury, nor with the purpose of
hoisting on the gibbet of public indignation the
individual actors who took a part in the very
commonplace tragedy herein related. For that
reason names of places and persons are altered,
and the description of occurrences so amended as
to preclude the possibility of recognition, save by
those who took part in them. Nevertheless, the
narrative is true from beginning to end. It is not
fiction founded upon facts, but the bare facts
unadorned, unexaggerated. Within the last seven
years, in a colony and near a city famed for its
exalted religious fervour —with the spires of its
churches visible from the warders’ watch-towers
—the swirling nine-thonged lash has stripped the
flesh from the quivering backs of convicts for
simple breaches of discipline, for offences so venial
that there is not a free man in Sydney from the
Premier to the pot-boy who can honestly confess
that he is not a sinner in an equal degree.

An English “ Divine,” as it is the fashion
to call our Church of England clergymen, Gurdon
by name, has written in the Times that “we
suffer from a general condition of unwhipped-
ness,” and with others would fain bring again
into operation all those delightful instruments of
torture which civilisation has relegated to the
chamber of horrors in the Tower and at the Wax-
works. The Mosaic Code is not stringent enough
for these wrathy mortals. They would prefer to
see the Indian code introduced. To catch a fellow
by the collar who Insults a woman or assaults a
feeble old man, and administer a thorough casti-
gation with any weapon you have handy would
be fair retaliation ; but in cold blood to tie up a
human being and administer deliberate torture is
debasing alike to those who inflict the punishment
and those who witness it—you brutalise them.
The rank and file of our soldiery was brutalised
when flogging was in vogue, and only since its
discontinuance has the standard of morality in our
army been raifteif.
* * *
But this is a digression I ought not to have
permitted myself. The story I have to tell is »f
the suffering entailed upon a man, Thomas Kane
by name, the victim of cruel circumstances in
which you or I, delicate reader, might have un-
happily been placed.
* ♦
This Thomas Kane was a hawker, the
owner of a spring-cart and pair of horses, and a
small stock of fancy goods (including cheap jewel-
lery), which he peddled about among the small
stations and farms in the interior of the colony.
He was accompanied by a woman, who might have
been his wife if she had not had a husband already
in existence. Ido not claim for this man that ho
bad an unblemished moral character. He may
have been a cheat and a trickster in his dealings
with the simple country folk ; he was certainly
given to use bad language ; occasionally he drank
more than was good for him ; was slovenly and
dirty in his habits; and, worst of all, he never
went to chapel, though now and again he 're-
sponded to the begging appeal of a clergyman of
the church to which he nominally belonged. During
one of his hawking tours he made the acquaintance
of a drover, Foley by name, who was then out of
employment. Foley happened upon the hawker’s
camp one evening at sundown, and, turning out
bis horse, boiled his billy at the Kane fire. In the
course of the evening Foley and Mrs. Kane dis-
covered that they had met in a previous sphere of
existence, when the lady was retailing liquor over
J oe bar of a small public-house in Castlemaine, and
me drover had been driving the butcher’s cart
Which brought the supplies of meat to the Dig-
ger’s Fleece. Foley camped next day with the
Hanes, and, according to the statement made by
the hawker, being hard up for cash, and having
n ° property but his horse, a silver watch, and Ins
SWa g, sold the watch to Kane for £2., The same
evening Foley gave Kane Bs. of this money to buy
a bottle of gin at the nearest bush public-house, a
b>ile from the next camp, and the liquor was con-
jmmed by the three friends that night. Foley and
cbo lady had now become more intimate ; and, as
me drover was not a bad-looking fellow —though
a rather dissipated appearance; and the lady,
hough approaching the forties, was not altoge-
her ill-favoured, it may be that each found in the
mer a magnet of attraction strong enough to

Early the next morning, while Kane was
coping off the effects of his over-indulgence,
c o!ey left the camp, and, riding to the nearest
police station, informed the officer in charge that
on the previous evening he (i.e., Foley) laid camped
near a hawker’s cart. After tea he had been in-
duced to drink some gin supplied by the hawker,
and had then fallen asleep. At daylight he awoke,
and, feeling for his watch, discovered that it had
been stolen from him. Some one-pound notes had
also been stolen from his trousers pockets. He
described the watch, having fortunately kept the
guarantee issued by the Melbourne watchmaker
who had sold him the timepiece six months before.
Ho did not remember the numbers of the notes
alleged to have been stolen. The police-
sergeant rode out to Kano's camp, made
a search and discovered the watch in
one of the boxes on the cart. I need
110 J’ 0 details of how Kano was ar-
rested. It may briefly be mentioned that he
was brought before the local bench at the nearest
township and a prima facie case having been
made out to the satisfaction of the magistrate
the unhappy prisoner was committed for trial at
the next District Court, which fortunately for the
speedy attainment of justice, commenced at this
town in three days. The prisoner had given into
the charge of his “wife” the small stock of
money they possessed (some £7O), but so confident
was he ol acquittal that he engaged no counsel to
d ° fend ' llm - The case came on for trial, and
after the constable, Foley, and the watchmaker
had gtven evidence, the Prosecutor called Honora
Oaflery into the witness-box. With much falter-
ing and many tears the estimable creature con-
fessed she was not the lawful wife of the prisoner ;
and it was not until much persuasion and many
threats had been employed to extract the evidence
from her that she admitted having seen Kane
take the watch from Foley while that unsuspect-
ing gentleman was lying on the ground in the un-
consciousness of intoxication.
* * *
Kane told me, long afterwards, that he
looked at this woman while she gave her evidence,
but all power of speech or even of thought
seemed to have deserted him. He asked no ques-
tions and answered none ; he heard as in a dream
the verdict of guilty, and the judge’s brief homily
prior to passing sentence—’twelve calendar months
with hard labour in Her Majesty’s Labour Prison
at Dismal Creek.
* * *
In 187 81 applied for, and obtained the appoint-
ment of warder at the Dismal Creek prison. My
discharge as an ofllcer from the Imperial service
with a certificate of merit from the colonel of my
regiment, were my credentials. The duties of my
new situation were not severe, but monotonous,
compelling one to stand with rifle loaded and
I bayonet fixed, keeping guard over a gang of from
31 to 40 prisoners while they worked in the quarric s
from early morn to dewy eve. I had been there
for about two months, when I was promoted to
inside duty. It was part of my work to examine
the cells while their occupants were at the quar-
ries to see that everything was secure. In one of
the cells I found two or three rations of bread
behind the prisoner’s bedding. The cell was
tenanted by Thomas Kane. The next day I ob-
served the whole of the 24 hours’ supply had been
untouched. Not to weary with details, I may
mention here that Kane deliberately refused all
food for five days and reported himself sick. He
was examined by the gaol surgeon, and ordered to
go out to the quarry. Kane refused and was put
into solitary confinement on bread and water.
Out of sheer hunger he ate his bread, but at the
expiration of his confinement sullenly refused to
w'ork in the quarry. He was a man who had
evidently been unused to hard manual labour, and
was as physically unfit to wield a mauling-hammer
upon a block of stone as any draper’s shopman.
He was labouring under the impression that he
had been unjustly condemned to his present
misery without having the common-sense to
understand that he must make the best of a bad
I job. It was at this time, and this was the only
occasion, when he spoke to me of his trial. After
two weeks’ of solitary confinement on bread and
water without bed or light, he came out emaciated
pale as a ghost, but sullen-looking and obstinate
as ever. He was then brought before the visiting
magistrate—a coarse, sensual, immoral old gen-
tleman, whose evil life has since been happily
brought to a close—and sentenced to 25 lashes at
the triangle. It was 8 o’clock of a cold winter
morning, the frost had not yet melted in the quad-
rangle where the triangle was fixed. When the
gaoler, the justice (just out of his warm bed and
impatient for breakfast), the gaol-surgeon, the
hangman, and the warders stood awaiting the
arrival of the principal figure in the piece, I and
another brought the unhappy wretch out into the
yard. Shivering he was, having been all the cold
hours of the long night in his bedless cell of stone
and as we drew off his coarse cotton shirt and
bared his white back to the morning air it
sickened me to notice how thin and woe-begone the
jaunt creature looked, as with bowed head he
flood awaiting further developments. Had it
seen the scaffold upon which he stood there would
mve been less for him to dread—only the mo-
mentary pain, and then—rest. But defter hands
man mine now seized the prisoner, and, drawing
urn to the triangle bolted into the stone-wall
ashed his wrists to the beam above his head, and
iccured his ankles firmly to a ring in the stone,
the stubbornfellowuttered never a word. The cold
dr seemed to strike through his thin frame and as
ic shivered and cast his eye hopelessly around upon
he stolid crowd, I felt as I have never felt
lefore, and shall never feel again, a desire at all
iazards to throw prudence to the winds and help
human being in the agonies of physical suffer-
yet powerless to move hand or foot to help
nimself. Another moment and the cruel whip is
raised and falls with hissing sound upon the
quivering flesh, curling over the shoulders and
around the ribs ; the purple and crimson stripes
spring out clear from the white skin and the drops
of blood are already oozing from the punctures
where the knots of the lash have pierced the skin
With a groan and a cry after each stroke, and a
brief exclamation to the God who created him for
mercy where men have shown none, the
miserable man receives his allotted punishment.
A coarse towel is thrown over his shoulders, he is
unloosed from the triangle, one of the warders
remarks that “the beggar is warmer now than
when he came out of the cell,” the justice is
driven home to his breakfast, a prisoner is sent
with a mop and a bucket of water to clean up, and
the performance is ever for the day.
* *
Is this horrible enough ? There is more to
add which I will shorten as much ns possible.
Kane still refused to work, and the gaol surgeonj
who was a moderately humane man—-for a gaol
surgeon—gave him 14 days’ release from work on
half-rations. At the end of that time the recusant
fool still objected to go to the quarries, and when
the gaoler remonstrated with him on his folly he
was ungrateful enough (or mad enough, call it
what you will) to pour out a torrent of abuse not
only upon the judge who sent him there, but
upon the gaoler who kept him there. The lan-
guage, I was told, overstepped the remotest

I Dear Bulletin, —Concerning the hang-

The Discharged Prisoners’ Aid Society is
an institution established by the Salvation Army
for the purpose of assisting discharged prisoners
and providing them with tools of trade, &c., till
they are able to earn their own living. It has
done a great deal of good work in Melbourne.
There are a number of discharged prisoners, how-
ever, who are very much dissatisfied with it.
I hey complain that they have been unable to
obtain tools of trade on application. Perhaps
tins is not so surprising, as the tools in
question were crowbars, “jimmies,” revolvers
and dark lanterns. As it happens this class will

An esteemed correspondent sends us the
following little idea :
In reference to the N.S W. Centennial, my suggestion is
that the colonists should celebrate the occasion by erecting a
bu,ldin .g t 0 hold from 3000 to 4000 people?
f site o h (? v h S improvements as regards health, on
a site ol (say) 2000 acres, which would accommodate our
surplus p-isontts for the present. It is my opinion that, if
crime takes the strides it has done lately, in less than five
years two or three such places will be inadequate to our
necessity. All the guests at this establishment should be
made to work, and this rule might be enforced by means of
the .Labour Bureau system used in Holland, wheie every man
who takes to permanent loafing is put into a tank with a
Pump, and if he will not pump he drowns. I think this will
be better than building an Exhibition and burning it down
again, or 14 days, hard booze and diinking all the beer in the
country, for we all know that drunkenness is the father of
crime and idleness is its mother, and N.S W will never be
prosperous while her politicians go boozing about the coun-
try or fuddling m the Parliamentary refreshment-mom.”
Justice has a leaden heel—and moves bu-fc
slowly. A t Camooweal Q.) she got her hoof by
mistake on Theodore Mirls and then she went to
sleep. Mirls was suspected of something and
was remanded for three weeks by a humane ius-
tice because he was too ill to be brought up, and
there being no gaol he was left to recuperate
chained to a post. Kind-hearted people came
along now and then to see what the animal was
like, and looking in at this bush temple of justice
would advise the prisoner to “ keep his pecker
up,” or would admire him from a distance as if he
were a dugong in an aquarium. He has since
committed suicide, and when he was dead he was
shoved into the tomb, boots, clothes, and all, with
a brief intimation above him to the effect that he
had been “ ordered up.”
A clue has at length been furnished re-
garding the old Bermagui mystery. Almost any-
thing will answer for a clue in N.S.W.—a stove-in
hat, a button, a flat-iron and a dream have all
been used for the purpose ; a smell of beer and a
dry bone have proved very serviceable in their
way ; and a yell, a dishonoured cheque, a disem-
bodied spirit, and the fragments of a man who had
been chawed up by a shark form a chain of evi-
dence that is almost irresistible. The present clue
comes in the form of a yell. The mate of a vessel
that was drifting into Bermagui harbour on the
night of the supposed murder remarked to his
captain that “ the sea gulls had been kicking up a
d d row this watch,” and his captain now re-
ports that the row in question must have been the
shrieks of the victims. He doesn’t say how he
arrives at his conclusion, but some men don’t
need to arrive, they are there already, In fact,
1 they were born there,

If there is any truth in the cable that
£lOO aside has been staked in England to bind a
match between J fanlan and Beach to row on the
Nepean for £5OO aside in June or July next, The
Bulletin contends that Beach has made a big
mistake in playing into Hanlan’s hands by fore-
going his long-stated determination not to row on
any Australian course but the Parramatta. On
the fresh, calm bosom of the Nepean, its waters
ever flowing with the scullers—perhaps a fresh in
the river—Banian will have a hundred to one
better show than he would on the tidal waters of
the orthodox champion course. With age, Beach
will, in the course of nature, further increase
in avoirdupois, and it is not likely he will
again row under the Jumbo weight of 13 stone
—a weight which it will take a big boat to
carry buoyantly in fresh water. Should Beach
bo defeated he can bet his bottom dollar he
will never again get a show of meeting Hanlan on
the Parramatta ; and it is to be hoped when it is
all over the champion will not have reason to cry,
‘‘Save me from my cabling friends !” That we
saw Hanlan —“gasbag ” though he be—at his best
on the Parramatta we never believed, and we do
not think Beach is justified in throwing a chancp
away. When in Australia, Hanlan held Beach
cheap, lived on chicken and champagne, and wor-
shipped freely at various shrines which he didn’t
oughter. Hanlan is evidently not yet by any
means smashed up, and we are heretical enough
to believe that, should he return to Australia and
train squarely for four months, the Canadian, with
youth and everything else on his side, except
brute strength, will beat Beach hands down.
There, now!

Wrestlers are rolling into Melbourne from
all quarters of the globe. The latest arrival is a
frail-looking Italian named Sali, who, with a height
of sft.' 6in., measures over 48 inches round the chest,
and weighs Isst. Sali has put up a deposit of £lO
for a match, Grgeco-Roman—chewing and gouging
strictly prohibited —with the winner of the Miller-
Cannon match. This match comes off on 18th
inst., from which it would appear the men have
not left themselves much time for preparation.
Cannon says he does not think much of a man who
cannot get into condition in a fortnight or three
weeks, which sounds very much as an excuse for
the early date at which the match is fixed. If
Cannon really wants some genuine work why
doesn’t he make a fixture with Connor ?

The unfinished races at Balmain Regatta
were brought offon Saturday afternoon in an easterly
breeze. 1 At the start the Sao came into collision
with the Poyen and brought the centreboarder’s
topmast and gear down by the run. The Sirocco,
scratch, finished five-and-a-half minutes ahead of
the Assegai, 6 minutes, so the Assegai secured
first prize. The 20 to 22 feet race was won by the
Guinevere from scratch, beating the speedy 20
footer Nereus by 2inin. Bsec. outside the time al-
lowance. The 22 feet and undes 24 feet open
boats proved a great race bet ween the Harold and
the Rosetta, the pair being sailed by the old-time
professionals, George Fletcher and Tom Colebrook
respectively. Neck and neck they raced through-
out, and Colebrook eventually brought the Rosetta
in first some ten lengths ahead of the Harold.

Poor Teddy M‘Grade may be said to have
died at his po&t, for when the last was seen of
him on the doomed ship Keilawarra he was stand-
ing at the horses’ heads on her deck. Many a
good “ tip ” wa* given by Teddy, and his lasi
word§ to a fellow jockey, made on leaving the
wharf were, “ I think Hfexham will win the Sum-
mer Cup ; I have backed him and advise you to
do the same.” M‘Grade was a general favourite,
and if the wagers were made known, racing men,
proverbial for their easy-come-and easy go in
money matters, would no doubt pay up and keep
the wagers good. In the event of a win it would
prove a help for his widowed mother. Ishmael,
by First King, dam Emily, one of the horses on the
Keilawarra, ran lately under black and rose
colours, but was not successful. He was bred by
Mr. Lee, and was one of the handsomest horses
seen at Randwick.

A bit of sport was brought off at Foley’s
Athletic Hall on Friday last, when Summer and
Winter met in the persons of Jack Molloy and
Sandy Ross, for a knock-out with the mittens.
Old Sandy has cultivated quite an aldermanic
bingey since we saw him last, and it looked so in-
viting that Molloy could not resist trying its
quality with a heavy stab from the left. This
roused Sandy up, and upon his leading, Molloy
stepped in and brought his right heavily on to
Sandy’s jaw, bringing the old ’un to the boards.
Sandy was knocked groggy, and within half a
minute of the men shaking hands the sponge was
thrown up in Ross’s corner. Poor old Sandy
looked more in training for a Mayor Riley’s feed
than a glove fight. King, a recent arrival from
England, then tackled Molloy, and suffered the
same fate as Sandy. Molloy is now possessed of
a good right hand that, given he is fit and well,
will put any hut the best of them in their little
cots.

Sir Joseph Banks Handicap on Saturday last,

idea that Trinder on a level track can run four

The best fight at Foley’s on Saturday night
was between the lads Willis and Potter, a couple
of light’uns. Willis shapes like a tradesman, and
when it came to real fighting brought his man
doWh with a cross-counter on the point of the jaw.
In the second round Willis was generous and eom-
menced to play light, but his opponent commenc-
ing to get rough Willis in self-defence brought
Potter down with another on the jaw. This com-
pletely demoralised him, and W illis had him at
his mercy for the remainder of the bout. Mul-

It seems a strange thing that Cyclist
Bennett, who has refused so many inducements
to re-appear upon the racing track, should seem
so anxious to take part in the proposed “ mixed”
match. We fancy the only good to be derived
from the affair will be a big ad. for a certain
make of bicycle. Bennett and Wood and the
Englishmen are representatives of the same make
of machine, so that whoever wins they can adver-
tise it as the winning machine of the celebrated
mixed mateh.

The fact that eight out of the ten of the
Englishmen were clean bowled on Saturday
is indisputable evidence of the excellence of
Turner and Ferris’ bowling. The English-
men are a strong batting team, there can be no
denying, and with a splendid wicket and glorious
weather their score might reasonably have been
expected to reach 300. Had it not been for the
phenomenal stand made by. Lehmann and Sher-
win, who even surprised their own men, the score
would have been very moderate indeed.

Much surprise was caused at the order the
Englishmen went in to bat in the match against
the N.S.W. Juniors, till the crowd found out that
the novelty of putting the names in a hat had
been resorted to, a little game we do not think they
will play when meeting a decent team.

America is looked upon as the home of the
centreboard boat, but if the J. S. Poyen, jr. (why
doesn’t Sir. Jewett change her name ?) is a fair
sample, Sydney has not much to learn from the
Yankees. When the J. S. P., jr., arrived in Port
Jackson she had a wooden board about the size
we carry in a 14-foot dingy, her heavy mast had
only one shroud, and to set that up the end was
rove through the eye on the shroud-plate and
seized on to the standing part of itself, a method
that made it impossible to set up the stays at all
taut without putting cm a strain sufficient to tear
the shroud-plates off the side of the boat. Her
sails were badly balanced, and Mr. Jewett soon
saw that to stand any show with the splendidly
equipped Sydney craft, he would have to refit her
from stem to stern. George Ellis’ wese the able
hands into which the craft was placed. The mast
has been put a foot further aft, the mainsail has
been cut down, two cloths added to iib, and a
steel plate 10 feet long and eight feet deep substi-
tuted for the wretched bit of wood which did duty
for a centreboard. It is also said lead has been
moulded to her keel, and that she carries shifting
ballast, but this we cannot vouch for. However,
one thing is very certain. She came with a repu-
tation for speed from America, where they are
supposed to know all about the centreboarder,
and showed herself little hotter than a tub, but,
having had her fitted up in Port Jackson fashion,
Mr. Jewett is now the possessor of a smart crafc.

Poor Fred. Archer seems to have been in
the saddle almost to the very last. On October
21st he won a race in Ireland, riding for the Lord
Lieutenant, and on the 28th he was only beaten
a short head for the Cambridgeshire, riding the
Duchess of Montrose’s St. Mirin. In this latter
event the “demon” nearly brought off a very
clever coup, as the stable had a warm first
favourite in Carlton, who finished third. One of
Archer’s last mounts was on Ormonde, probably
the best horse that he or any other jockey ever
rode. Talking of that, an English bookmaker
laid £3OOO to £5O on Ormonde—a pretty high com-
pliment to horse, jockey, and owner. There are
not many Australian books who would care to
risk that amount of money in a similar specu-
lation.

Since his financial affairs got into a queer
state, Cook, the billiardist, seems to have pulled
himself together and returned to something like
old form. At latest dates he was playing a‘ ‘ spot-
barred ” game with Roberts—receiving 3000 in
11,000 —and holding his points. During one
evening’s pi ay, Cook put in such breaks as 101,
154, 103, 147, and 313. In a previous match
against Mitchell, Roberts cut the record by totting
up 534 ii an “ all-round” break. And they once
talked of matching Weiss against the English
players!

Scott was out seven times l.b.w. during
the last English tour. Grace, Shrewsbury, Horan,
and a lot of other crack batsmen appear to find it
answer to cover their wickets with their fogs and
risk the l.b.w. Now, in the happy days ofchlld-
hood, when we played cricket, the juvenile bowler
would order a batsman off the wicket if he eheao.
It was the correct thing from our point of view.
The “demon” of that'period was supposed to be
bowling at three slumps, and he liked to see ’em
before he made a start.

None but red-hot Beachites will aceepfc
his statement that Australian amateur rowing is
better than the home article. The Americans
have tried conclusions with four-oar crews from
Oxford University and the London Rowing Clnb,
and on each occasion the Yanks were very badly
beaten. Professional rowing has fallen into dis-
repute in England, and its present exponents arc
men of poor physique and little intelligence.
There are but a few of them even at that. But
it must he remembered that there are at least
seven times as many amateurs in England (in fair
practice) as there are in Australia, and the average
weight of the University men is greater than that
of the N.S.W. and Victorian amateur champions.

Beach-poetry is making us very ill.
“H.E.” —we suppose it’s Lord Garington—is a
bard of promise, and when we find such stirring
lines as these we wish we were a poet, too, who
had died in the last century :
“ Your late career upon the Thaeaeg
Has opened the world’s eyes.
And left the Yankee* in a mess,
With sorrow in their eyes.”
Not to he outdone, Bard Halloran emerges from a
silence of several days and gives us something to
go and die on. We merely quote the last verse so
that the first may he guessed at: —
“ Nay, do not slink away,
All have not equal powers*
But where he holds the sway
His glory still is ours.
Give welcome gladly still,
And let our greeting be,
Welcome, brave-hearted Bill!
Australia welcomes thee.”
“ Brave-hearted Bill,” is nearly as good as “ Plain
EMU.” We now claim that we possess the “two
Bills ” of the universe.

Poor Donald Dinnie’s reputation for canni-
ness—based upon his well known caution in the
scattering of small siller—is irretrievably ruined.
Donald kept possession of somebody’s horse for a
disputed debt. The fiery steed grazed in a pad-
dock attached to Donald’s rural pub, at Alphing-
ton (Vic.), and for a time the braw Scot seemed bo
have the best of the deal. Then commenced a
long wrestle between Donald and the remorseless
law. After about six trials, sundry executions,
and a few summonses for assaulting bailiffs,
Donald had to part £4O odd of accumulated penal-
ties to keep himself out of gaol. At latest date
Donald was still guarding those bones of conten-
tion which constitute the horse, and another trial
was pending. The derned quadruped is valued at
£l3. That’s where the joke comes in.

After this who will say that the cornstalk
is not plucky ? Some time ago a tight-rope walker
exhibited in Yass, N.S.W. He asked for a boy to

but ewing to some mishap the two came to the
ground and the boy got his leg broken. Some
time after another ropowalker came. He asked
for a boy ; and without the slightest hesitation a
local youngster—a good heavy boy, too—came
forward and went through the whole performance.
Judge Giblin (Tasmania.)
Mr. Jus'EiCK Giblin, -whose portrait appears oh
page 9, is a man of many premierships and many
honours, having during his brilliant career at-
tained to the highest position with whieh a colony
oan reward its citiaens. His public life began
when at the age of 24 he, la partnership with Mr.
W. Dobson, entered into business as a solicitor.
Upon the death of this partner Mr. Henry Dobson
succeeded to the vacant place, and two years later
Mr. G iblin accepted office as Attorney-General in
the Wilson Administration. Upon Mr, Wilson’s
death the Ministry was reconstructed and con-
tinued under the leadership ef Mr. Chapman. A
further reconstruction upon Mr. Chapman’s re-
tirement made it necessary for Mr. Giblin to take
the office of Premier and Treasurer. Since
then his terms of office have been fre-
quent, and it was while holding the At-
torney-Generalship in his own Ministry that
he accepted the puisne judgeship which he
still regains. Subsequently the Chief Justiceship
was offered him, but he refused it, and used his
influence for the appointment of its present
holder, Sir W. L. Dobson. - Mr. Giblin recently
has been acting as Chief Justice during absence
on leave of Sir W. L. Dobson, and upon Sir
George Strachan’s departure was for a time
acting-governor. The sons of Judge Giblin would
seem to inherit his talent, one of them having
lately won the “Tasmanian Scholarship,’ an
honour worth £2OO a year, and tenable for four
years. Mr. Norman F, Giblin, the recently ap-
pointed manager of the Bank of New Zealand,

than Bailes taken up the case he might have made
the people of Victoria ashamed of their frantic
desire to invite out to this country a man of the
Wales class, but the miserable Dutch-couraged
grog-seller caved in when he heard that a pack of
his grovelling constituents were indignant at his
utterances—a report which, by the way, turns out
to be almost entirely a lie, Bailes now says he
didn’t mean to say anything bad about Wales,
and the lickspittles of the Victorian Assembly
pheered him as he made his abject apology.

“ Only Dust,” a eomedy of jalap, vanity,
and worldly shams, deserves better luck than it
is getting at Sydney Royal—but not much better.
There is no particular hero in the piece, for Dr.
Bolus, though the most prominent male charac-
ter, is not constructed that manner. He is an elderly
physician, a mild, fat, fussy, beaming individual,
whose only patient seems to be a dead bricklayer,
and whose assets consist of very little except his
second wife, his daughter, and his mortgaged
furniture. A good young man of the shaky, un-
easy order of architecture has his eye on the
daughter, and Bolus, backed by his' ambitious
wife, tries to act the mercenary father. This is
hard enough for an individual of his feather-bed
character, but when the young man’s parents a-
rive to take stock things get worse. Mrs. Bolus,
however, throws herself manfully into the breach.
She persuades her visitors that the 16 creditors
who are howling for eash downstairs are all
wealthy nobleman waiting for the physician’s ser-
vices, and only howl on account of their inward
agony ; she spreads £lOO which the doctor had
raised on the furniture all round the room, until
it looks as if the “ Man made of Money ” had
been wrecked thereabouts, and she passes off a
fifteen shilling chrome as a Correggio. The visitors
consist of a very full-blown lady, and her washed-
out lugubrious husband, who looks as if he wanted
to weep at the sight of his own legs, and this pair
of vulgar frauds get the blind staggers as they look
on all these e 1 lences fw e ilth. Finally Mr". Bolus
borrows a supernaturally pompous flunkey from
next door and sends him on to deliver to the
doctor a letter from a countess and to announce
the arrival of seven earls and a duchess who are
all supposed to be ill with measles down stairs,
and the work is completed. The ex-sugar-brokor
and his wife are convinced that from earliest
morn to nigh;, mounted couriers are spurring
from east, west, north, and south la rearch of the
learned and solemn Bolus ; and that in the street
below the Utter conveying the duke with the
broken log is raced by that bearing the marquis
with the dislocated spine, all speeding in reared
of the healer; and when they learn in addition
that the great man is writing a book on “ The
Inner Ipecacuanha of the Hippopotamus ” they
flop in silent awe.
** * .
The remaining two acts show a woeful
falling off. Mr Samuel Puddicombe the awe-
stricken sugar-broker tries to play the doctor's
own game, but he only succeeds in making 130
differed kinds of a fool of himself, and gats
laughed at by his ooal-heaving brother. His wife
whose intellect was shattered and blighted by the
“ Inner Ipecaeuanha of the Hippopotamus” re-
solves to show that she is also possessed of
scientific knowledge, and discourses learnedly of
neuralgia in the legs, and by way of outdoing
Bolus in the world of fashion she abducts a small
shoe-black and polishing his phis with his own
blacking, starts him as a negro page. She hires
12 flunkeys in order to crush her rival in one act,
wnd dresses them up like green goblins of the
Middle Ages—and then her brother-in-law bowls
the doctor out at the last moment by explaming
that he can’t pay for his coals. After this the
good : hnmourod ooal-heaver tips his long white hat
over one rakish eye, smites his yellow waistcoat,
and says he will give £20,600 to the young couple.
Bolus had just offered to settle £2,000,000 on them,
haring resolved in a frensy to go the whole hog,
but he utters a moral sentiment, and the curtain
falls.

Signora Majeroni was excellent as Mrs.
Bolus, and the other characters were well filled,

part of Samuel Puddicombe. We reserve the rest

James Ralston, alias “Jim ths Penman,”
dies nightly to admiring crowds at Sydney Opera
House. We once knew another man whose sur-
name Was Ralston, and his way of writing signa-
tures showed whole oceans of genius. They were
of his own name every time,but the waiting looked
as if it had been done by a Rotorua earthquake
operating on the business end of a flre-abovel. It
was file copyright joke in that office to tell a new
clerk that the signature—whieh no living man
ever read at sight—was that of Jonathan J.
Juggins, and the innocent youth would take an
early opportunity of raising a tornado by address-
ing the sigoator as Mr. Jtjuggins. But the signa-
ture of this worthy was not so bad as that of a
Sydney bank-manager who one day signed and
issued.a lot of now notes. Such an atrocious ap-
pearance did his writing bear that before mid-day
a man was in the lock-up for trying to pass one of
these notes, which an evening paper pronounced
to be “an exceedingly clumsy forgery, too bad to
escape instant detection. ’ That manager did not
sign many more notes; the bank rose tojan appre-
ciation of the fact that his writing was not suit-
able for exhibition purposes.

But it’s time we said something of the
show. Mr. Frank Cates seems to have infused a
lot mere of humanity into, and to have extracted
a heap of rigidity jfrpm, his Louis Percflval, who
uow really looks as k he had oooe lived and loved,
before his soul and body bad been played Bpen by/
a sere*© frost. As to the other characters it is
not possible that they could have improved much
on their first essay in this drama in Sydney.
Which is more than we have ever said in praise
of anyone since nurse first exhibited to our enrap-
tured gaze—but there, you know how it is your-
self most of you.

We desire above all things to be ehari- I

of dark malignity into the digestive organ of I
genius, and vve would like if we could to spread I
the perpetual fruit of the cow over the actor’s I
imtfln --but wo oan’t. Wc have witnessed “ Called
Barit at Sydney Gaiety, and wc regret to say I
that we are unable to lift, up our voices and do-
cln*>o that all is O.K. Mr. Sheridan takes the I
part of Maoaip, and makes that conspirator a pon- I
derous, beetle-browed desperado who is perpetu-
ally hanging on to a stiletto and saying in hollow I
assents, “Beware !” He commits the first murder I
in business-like style, and then Mr. Taylor, in the
ehamtaer of Gilbert Vaughan, walks in with an }
easy stride as if he were a policeman instead of a I
blind and helpless stranger who had stumbled
into a den of assassins, and kneels down alongside
th« body. In the second scone the conspirator is
heavier, darker, and looks more than ever as if lie
ought to be hanged at sight. He haunts Vaughan
remorselessly and sits about like a conundrum I
ended up, or an Egyptian hieroglyphic cocked in
the air, while that gentleman is making love to I
Pauline, till at last some faint of lois
villainous and depraved “mug" reach even her
clouded intellect, and she has a vision. It
is a gorgeous affair of the lurid, smoky order,
and prominent in the foreground is' Macari
dancing among an assortment of vegetables. The
natural result is that Pauline gets madder than
ever, iwid Macari becomes more and more unpleas-
ant. His voice gets raspicr, he grows depraved
and tells lies, and he champs his jaws when he is
found out, and tolls his enemies to “ Beware.” Ho
visits Vaughan, and muses in a whispered roar
while that gentlemen fetches his half-insane wife,
and from his language it is evident ho fears his
dire Italian apple-curt is in danger of being over- I
set. And so it is. The dramatist at this point
takes another liberty with the text of the story by
again introducing the vision of the murderer and
the vegetables, and as the result of this and one
or two other incidents Macari is bowled out on his
next visit, and retires with a haughty Guy Faux
stalk, and with his poisonous nose held high up in
the air.

sues, or whether he hauls down a dish of boiling water
over himself, or is poisoned by some tinned salmon,
or Rough on Rats Sandwiches, or we are unable
to explain. Vaughan goes on a journey to Siberia
and comes back to live happily ever afterwards,
and on his return, according to the programme.
“ Macari plays a bold game,” so it is possible that,
he takes it up and goes alone with an ace in fad.

Having already done justice to the chief
conspirator we have only to mention that Miss
Davenport took the part of Pauline with moderate
success. While watching her we came to the con-
clusion that she is the only lady we have yet seen
who can make her mouth a complete square. Mr.
Taylor, as Gilbert Vaughan, was a failure as a
blind man, and was still worse when he recovered
his sight Mr. J. A. Nunn made a decided suc-
cess in t he part of Arthur Kenyon, and deserved a
better character than any in “ Called Back,” and
the rest of the parts were moderately filled'— very
moderately.

Dr. Lynn, at Sydney Academy, plays there
for only a short season, as he is due at Melbourne
for Christmas week. He is a clever man ;he puts
half-erowns through hats where never coins went
before and never will go again ; he draws cab-
bages out of places where such articles, would
never be expected to hide; and, cleverest of all,
he Alls the Academy with an ecstatic assemblage
of humanity. The vanishing lady is still the chief
attraction. Dr. Lynn should extend this feature
of his show. If he could run it by steam and
vanish mothers-in-law, amateur singers, Abigail,
Dibbs, and the deficit, he would get a double
encore every time, so long as a mother in-law, a
Dibbs, and a deficit could be discovered in the
whole wide world. The vivisection show is less
clever khan horrible. The doctor shpuld leave
that work to the butchers, or olse do it a lot more

musical talent of that city. Mrs. Palmer, Madame
Christian, Amies Beaumont, Gordon Gooch, and
nearly all the other principal vocalists hold aloof,
on the ground that a bazaar is an undignified way
of raising the £3OOO necessary to secure Mr.
Ormond s £20,000 to endow' a chair of music, and
that in making the offer Mr. Ormond intended
that the money should be subscribed.

Melbourne worriers of the Divine William
have been discussing the question : “ Was Shake-
speare a Custom-House officer ?” There is reason
to believe he was, and that his wife assisted him
in the business. Mark what he said of Cleopatra,
evidently with Mrs, S. in his mind’s eye, “Age
cannot wither her nor mistom stale hiwSnflnite
variety. Again, it was evidently the seizure of
some very overproof rum which suggested Ham-
lets soliloquy, “ This spirit which I have seen
may be the Devil.” Yet again, the words “spirits
rrom the vasty deep ” evidently refer to certain
goods in transit. Oh, Shakespeare was in the
C ustoms right enough. Many and many a half-
sovereign must have been slipped into the hand
that wrote “Macbeth.”

A real rousing burlesque has taken the
place of “ Silver Guilt ” at Melbourne Opera
House. Which its name is “ Young Fra Diavolo.”
In this Mr. Royce plays his old London Gaiety
character of Giacomo, and Mr. Robert Brough is
Beppo, a lively coadjutor in crime. They keep
things moving from start to finish. Mr. Wardo
dances as no other man in Australia can dance,
and Miss Fanny Kobina—the dainty Diavolo—has
to do everything twice over and still leaves her
admirers hungering for more The rest of the
company have caught a little of the principals’
enthusiasm, and, Judging from present appear-
ances, burlesque is likely to be a thriving fixture
under the Brough-Boucicaulfc management. “ Vice
Versa” holds its own as a first piece, and
would go better than it did a month ago, if that
were possible. This is about as much jam as wo
over put on at one helping.

Horatio CGilbert Parker has gone to Tas-
mania, having failed to persuade R. S. Smythc to
bring him out in Melbourne. The much-travelled
probably docs not Indiovo in Shakesporian reciters’

play the smallest part well on the stage, yet do
not hesitate to attempt the entire cast of charac-
ters, male and female, tragic and comic, on the

Two years ago Mr. Francis Ormond offered
£20,000 for the endowment of a chair of music at
Melbourne University conditionally on the public
supplementing his cheque with another three
thou, within 12 months. The total amount of the
first year’s subscriptions was twopence and a littli
over, so Mr. Ormond gave the music-loving Vic-
torians another year’s grace. Now, in their last
extremity, they are holding a Grand Operatic
Carnival in the Exhibition Building. It is to
extend over three weeks, and considering that
£lOOO was taken on the opening day, in shilling
admissions and fancy goods, the Chair is in a fair
way to be set up. The Carnival is a somewhat
live affair, especially about the witching hour of
0p m. Then the 500 ladies and gentlemen who
bleed the gentle visitors march around the build
ing in costume. There are “lolanthe” fairies,
“Bohemian Girl” peasants, “La Sonambula’s ”
with candles, “Carmen” gipsies, and a lot more
of it. The dresses are above the average level of
oostumery at bazars, and if the ladies inside
them had new faces and figures, this procession
would be out-and-out dazzling. It is very evident
however, that the music enthusiasts of Melbourne
are a rmn-looking lot. Plenty of side-shows help
things along, and, take it altogether, the man who
gets in on the “nod” and doesn’t buy anything
has a fair evening’s entertainment for his money. |

The yam is told as new and original. A
Melbourne hatter sent round to the Theatre
Royal, requesting “the favour of complimentary
tickets.” He got his tickets and enjoyed the
performance immensely. Next day the Trium-
virate sent a delegate to their friend, requesting
“ the favour of a hat.” They had him for the
“tile” and also enjoyed the performance im-
mensely. It was a case of the hatter hit. This is
either a fossil fact, or a brand-new lie, we don’t
know which.

Carrie Swain, the latest American novelty
is selling freely at Melbourne Theatre Royal
“The Tomboy” is a five-act comedy drama
“ written expressly ” for Miss Carrie.” This is
what the bill says. Many are of opinion, how
ever, that Miss Carrie was expressly born, nur
tured and educated for this particular comedy
drama. It is a work which puts no strain upon
the spectator’s intellectual faculties. The threat
of the Narrative can bo dropped at 8.30 and picked
up again at 9 45 without marring the spectator’s
enjoyment. All he has to do is to “ plank hie
greed,” secure a seat, look at the lovely Tomboy,
and wonder what she’s going to do next. Miss
Swain may be said to drop upon the public like
hundred at bricks—
O ! make no blooming error,
This young lady is a “ terror,”
She is full of fun and frolic
As an egg is full of meat ;
Though merry, young and charming
Carrie’s very quite alarming—
She is sometimes on her head,
And she’s sometimes on her feet.
In a general way the Tomboy is kicking off some-
body’s hat, fondling her blind mother, jumping
out of a four storey window, dressing up in boy’s
clothes, singing gentle lullabies to a child, or
swimming across the Atlantic Ocean with said
child on her back. Any spare momenta are filled
in with somersaults and jigs. But there are two
styles of getting through this sort of work, and
Mies Swain has the style that takes. She sings
her songs as though they ©ame straight from her
wild untutored heart, and dances as though she
gloried in the job. She can be pathetic, too, and
bring the salt tear-drop to the gallery boy’s eye.
There is ail about and around her performance a
|w°. s P on fcancity, conspicuously absent from tha
kitteniahness ” of Miss Minnie Palmer. And yet,
and yet—well, there is only one Maggie Moore.
Miss Swain’s supporters at the Royal are mora
than equal to what they have to do. That isn’t!
much. As a blind and phenomenally credulous
mother Mrs. George Gordon deserves special com-
mendation. The piece is well mounted, and, as
the present season only lasts for three weeks in
all, business is bound to bo good right away
through. Three weeks is nothing to anyone like
Miss Carrie. She could “do it on her head, yec
worship.”

Life is short—and art is not very extended
—with the English music-hall artists. The “great
George Leybourne ” died a broken-down old man
of something under forty. In his case, perhaps,
the wonder was that he lived as long as ho did.
Hut within the last few months there have shullied
oIF two “ celebrities ” who might reasonably havo
boon expected to roach middle age. Most young
new-chums, expiating past sins with a spell of
colonial experience, ’’remember Prod Coyne and
Prod Albert. The former gave an admiring world
Mary Ann, Mary Ann, I’ll toll your mar,” and
‘ The Swing went a little bit Higher.” The latter
was the “renowned topical vocalist,” who com-
posed his own songs, so called, and talked them
at tlio audionce with a deal of inappropiate ges-
ture. Both men died from catching slight colds.
So, too, did Ixjnnard Charles, who assisted his
massive wife in singing duets, They were gone
to-day and here to-morrow, as the widow O’Brien
put it. Evidently the vitiated atmosphere in
which a music-hall star spends his evenings plays
the dickens with chest and lungs, and is a mora
deadly enemy than the drink supplied by in-
fatuated admirers.

Why Lord Carington failed to do the duty
for which the colony pays him, by refusing to ex-
tend his patronage to Mons. and Madame Pous-
sard is not exactly clear ; but it is certain enough
that his abstention from the show was the signal
for unmitigated condemnation by the Sydney
dailies. This censure in the case of the violinist
was so manifestly unfair as to escape (ho imputa-
tion of-malice only by its own inherent signs of
incompetency. As a violinist Mons, Poussard can.
play three times round lots of men who having
secured vice-regal patronage have also secured
the most extravagant praise from the daily press.
Toadyism infects even newspaper criticisms of art

Poussurd’s next concert is on Friday, the ITlhinet!
Those persons who love music will go there, those
who love to be w'hcre the Governor is will go else-

Mr. C. J. Buckland, who has been selected
to proceed to England for the purpose of putting
on to the London market certain well-known
Queensland and other mining properties, was
entertained at dinner the other evening by a'num-
ber of his fellow members of the A the minim Club,
the festive board being presided over by the Hon!
Edmund Barton. Should the present inclination
on the part of the English public to invest in Aus-
tralasian mining stocks be sustained, the colonies
will reap much solid benefit from Mr. Buckland’a
trip, as among the properties with which he lias
to deal arc undeveloped mines located on lines of.
reef which have secured North Queensland her
present pre-eminence in the mining world. It is
to be hoped, also, for the sake of the ultimate
reputation of Australia as a field for mining capital
that the same good fortune which has attended
many of the companies for which Mr. Buckland is
responsible will attend his present ventures. It
was lie who, in the youth of the N.S.W. silver-
industry made the first move in the direction of
importing from America the latest silver-smelting
appliances and Che best skilled labour ; and the
shares of the huge Broken Hill Co.—an enterprise
floated by him—originally £9, are now worth and
sailing at £7O to £6O.
As the public know, nine men aro now
under eon t cnee of death at Darliughurst prison
Sydney. The sjze of the present permanent gal-'
lows at that institution is such as only to allow
of the simultaneous execution of two men—and
there has for many many years been in Sydney no
occasion on which more than two criminals havo
had their necks judiciously broken at once. As it
would perhaps be rather too much for* the
stomachs of even the N.S.W. public to have the
hangman choking his victims and carrying their
coffins off under his arm two at a time for a
whole morning, it has been thought best to make
preparations which will permit of the execution
of the whole nine men at once, and instructions
with that view havo been issued to the Sheriff.
This latter official is already being worried night and
day by would-be spectators of the forthcoming
hideous orgie of dislocated vertebrae—by men
who would gaze on the horrid sight of a noseless
hangman slaughtering the sons of old women who
wait the while outside Die prison gates—men who
would feast their eyes on the hell-like spectacle of
the official man-slayer cutting down his corpses
and coolly humping them off, as a butcher humps
away the body of a slaughtered sheep. Such
is the civilisation of the so-called Nineteenth
Oentnry.

Merry Christmas is in hail, the season of
carnival and gorge, time of reckless revelry and
concrete cake. Now poultry is nurtured with
wondrous care ; the haughty turkey lives a life of
luxury and ease, the common hen and the lowly
duck are treacherously induced to eat, drink, and
make merry. But it is the staid old goose that is
the main object of popular anxiety. 'this in-
teresting feathered songster may be found in every
family to day, being feted and feasted till she
has inherited a kingdom ; but the contemplative
biped is of a perverse, stubborn disposition, and it
is interesting to note that, though every oppor-
tunity is given her to acquire an aristocratic
obesity, she grows more spare and spiteful every
day, becomes slovenly in her habits and neglect-
ful of her appearance, and developes into an ex-
pensive epicure, tickling her appetite with luscious
bits, eating only dainty, indigestible trifles, and
regarding wholesome food with royal scorn. The
restless endeavour to improve the condition of the
tame goose has failed, resulting only in disap-
pointment and regrets. We have had a gander
chained to a log in our yard, and surrounded by
the fat of the land, these many days. We hoped
to see him grow corpulent and contented, and
fostered him like a teething infant. We spoon-
fed him with farinaceous diet at regular intervals,
and watched his health with sympathetic love ;
but the wretched bird is waning away and waxing
thin like unto a consumptive kanaka. He came
to us a fairly handsome, healthy gander, but now
he is a wreck, a very monument of desolation.
His plumage has come out by the roots, his neck
is nude and knotted, and scurvy is pillaging his
sparse frame of its scanty juice. Three lank, in-
glorious feathers mark the spot where a tail once
flourished, and when he rears up you'd think he
was a worn-out hand-broom on crutches. All day
he mopes, gaunt and grim, brooding o’er his pris-
tine splendour We feel we can never bring our-
selves to slay the morose, dyspeptic fowl; we must
make him a present to our aunt at Dapto.

The various branches of the Geographical
Society of Australasia have received a communi-
cation from Lord Carington conveying the intel-
ligence that Her Majesty the Queen has graciously
permitted the Society to assume the title of
“Royal” : —
There are people who, if allowed to, would
paste advertisements on theirmother’s tombstones.
1-lead this from a Melbourne paper
" Fire! Fire ! Fire at Beeston Mills. Fifteen hundred
persons thrown out of employment. In consequence of this
terrible calamity we are enabled to offer job-lots of miLinery,
&c., &c., at prices ridiculously low.”
And so on, as though they gloated over the
calamity, and were only sorry it was not greater,
so that they could have got more job-lots to sell.
If, by any stretch of imagination these persons
could he pictured as angels remaining in Heaven
—they would have been sure to have been on the
side which paid best —after Lucifer and his fol-
lowers were cast out, then we might safely go on
to picture the celestial battlements as covered
with advertisements something like the follow-
ing ; —
“ ROLL UP ’ ROLL UP !
“Now is Your Time (On Eternity?).
“ In consequence of the eviction of the Great Archangel
and a third of the population of Heaven (from henceforth
to writhe in everlasting Sheol. Hosanna !) the enterprising
Angels Smarty and Hardasnails are enabled to offer at a
tremendous reduction from cost price a superb collection of
Crowns, Thrones, Harps, Shawms, Trombones, &c., &c.
(secured by them while the rest of the inhabitants of Heaven
were fighting). Remember these must be disposed of to make
way for a new stock of saints—expected to be created soon —
heavenly outfits.
“ Do not miss this chance. You may never have another.

A consignment of Bibles sent from Sydney
to Melbourne has, as the world already knows,
been confiscated by order of the Commissioner of
Customs on the ground that they are an American
piracy of the Revised Edition. The Commissioner
says he will not destroy them because of their
sacred character. Just think of it —a holy Ameri-
can steal! If this God-fearing official were to
distribute a portion of them among the various
police courts of his colony he would he doing a
good action. The use of directories and diction-
aries for swearing upon is considered to have de-
preciated the value of oaths about ninety per
cent, during the last two or three years. How-
ever, it can’t be denied that the Revised Edition
is not as good for Police Courts as the old-
fashioned Bible. The prospect of going to Sheol
if he prevaricate, doesn’t strike the same healthy
old terror to the soul of a ' haky witness as the
threat of Hell did. At the same time it must be
admitted that the Revised Edition is an improve-
ment on the Directory and the Age annual.

Henry Ward Beecher, in answer to a
question put to him concerning the Trinity, said
some time since to a congregation of ministers and
students for the ministry that “ He believed the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were separate per-
sons, but what was their mode '-of getting along
together ho did not know.” If we made such a
statement we would be called irreverent and de-
nounced in every little so-called Christian Hair-
Oil and Holiness Society in the country as blas-
phemers and sons of Belial. But, no matter—
what we want to know is why Henry Ward
Beecher, who is a shining light of his own variety
of religion, doesn’t know how the members of the
Trinity “ get along together,” when every little
bush-parson and bible-thumper throughout the
Australian group is acquainted not only with this,
but can tell you the division of labour among the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost —and what each
thinks of the other ! Mr. Beecher is behind the
times.
Two mates occupied the same sleeping
apartment in a Rockhampton boarding-house.
One was a Caledonian with a sentimental turn of
mind. This particular evening before retiring to
“ rust ” (Doric) he, with “ a voice of dolorous
pitch,” road for his friend Poe’s “ Annabel Lee.”
During the recitation the other man wept salt
tears. The next morning the reader could only
find his waistcoat in which to make his public ap-
pearance. The audience had also cleared. Tis
supposed he took this method of revenging him-
self for the agony he endured while listening to a
beautiful poem read with a Scotch accent.
Mr. Judge-for-a-short-time-by-special-com-
mission Stephen does not seem to be quite posted
up in his work, and, like Mr. Salomons, requires
a little information from Judge Windeyer with
regard to sentencing prisoners. When, for in-
stance, he sentenced Vere Hunt for his share of
the Sydney Lands Office frauds, he ordered him
“ three years’ hard labour.” “I am not able to do
any hard labour,” pleaded the prisoner, “ and ask
you to make it imprisonment only.” “Oh,” said
his Honor in a tone of evident surprise, “ I always
understood that ‘ hard labour ’ meant a mitigation
of the sentence.” Nice sort of young man Mr.
Stephen must be to try prisoners by commission
or any other way! Splendid chance a criminal has
in N.S.W. courts when Judge Docker thinks that
he is not able to give less than 10 years for embez-
zlement, and Mr. Stephen thinks hard labour a
“mitigation of the sentence.”
Tidings of joy for this lucky society
Through the good Governor came,
Now it can flourish, without impropriety,
“ Royal ” in front of its name.
Charming variety ! Proud notoriety
Can this Society claim ;
Rejoicing before in a sober mediety,
Now we are filled with a fearful anxiety
Lest all the savants renounce their ebriety—
That is the danger of fame.
Tidings of joy for this happy Society
Through the good Governor came —
Everything “royal” goes down with sassiety,
Grovel’s its end and its aim ;
Though this Society swells with satiety,
We, who are watching the game,
Must, in a spirit of cold contrariety,
Beg to express our disloyal dubiety
Whether this title (excuse our impiety)
Isn’t a prefix of shame.

The election of Alderman Riley as Mayor
of Sydney will be unpopular in some quarters.
The fact is that Mr. Riley is too confoundedly
aesthetic : he has never kept a grog-shop and he
has never stuck pigs for a living. He is generally
understood to look with favour neither upon the
Corporation ring which is “on the steal,” nor
upon that other ring which affects to believe that
a man can’t be tolerably honest unless he froths
at the mouth and invites such of his enemies as
happen to be about eight stone under his weight
to “ come outside.”
The new Mayor of Melbourne seems to be
something of a gusher. At the banquet a week
or two ago he said that “ if the Isle of Man were
called upon to elect a patron saint that saint would
be Lady Loch.” Humph ! The Isle of Man would
naturally make a woman its patron saint if it
wanted one. By the way, Mayor Cain is a Manx-
man. A suburban paper says this fact might he
made known to throw some light on the question as
to where the precious Cain died. Our own opinion
is that he never died, but flourishes in Australia
at the present day under another name —as a
Supreme Court Judge.
The Melbourne Age says in a leading

Chief Justice Way, of South Australia; was not
engaged to sit on the N. S. W. Bench, for we learfi
with regret that he also is “ wanting in dignity,”
and his “presence” is not what it ought to he.
Years ago he was a thin, plodding little party ; he
used to take down office-shutters in these days
and he didn’t look as if he was going to rise to
greatness. Now he is a stout, jaunty individual
who looks rakish except when he is hanging some-
body, and then he tones himself down till he only
looks gay, but though his intellect would fill a
barn he hasn’t been able to add an inch to his
stature. It was somewhere hack in the fifties
when Chief Justice Way took down the shutters
for the last time, and at iust about the same period
the present N.S. W. Premier, Sir Patrick Jennings,
abandoned his one-horse grocery store and his one-
dog post-office at St. Arnaud, and likewise took
the path that leads to fame, after having scattered
his little all in a wild* oat silvermine.
It may not be generally known that last
Monday was the anniversary of the day when
Smith, of Naseby, N.Z., disappeared with the
cash. Smith claimed to be the father of the
sluicing system employed on our alluvial gold-
fields, and many years ago he took possession of a
claim and a small waterfall at Naseby. Then he
got a sheet of galvanised iron and sticking it in
the middle of the fall he sent the water on to the
Washdirt below, and thus introduced genuine
sluicing in these colonies for the first time. The
claim, however, gave out after yielding ICO
ounces, but the local hanker was so impressed by
Smith's colossal intellect that he advanced him
£iooo. With this sum Smith undertook to introduce
a whole deluge of w*ater, and to put a square
mile of galvanised iron below at to sluice all Cen-
tral Otago into the middle of the Pacific. Then
be gathered up the £lOOO, together with his own
little pile, and did an alluvial skip into the wilder-
ness. Prom that day to this he has never been
heard of.
David Buchanan is permitted by the editor
of the London Times to relate in the columns of
“ the Thunderer ” the story of his life. David
says he landed in Sydney with a few shillings in
the year 1852, and lumped coal on the wharf —
"Year after year,” lie goes on, “I was engaged at the
hardest of work in Sydney and in every part of N.S.W. and
Victoria, such as stone-breaking, quarrying, splitting and
fencing, draj -driving, shingling, sawing, shepherding, hut-
keeping, sheep-washing, overlanding with sheep and cattle,
butchering, splitting logs for furnaces, hut-building, getting
the timber to do so, working in boiling-down establishments
and in soap and candle works, reaping, mowing and all farm
work, and an occasional voyage to sea, working my passage
wherever 1 went.”
He never found any difficulty, he says, in getting
employment, hut after a while he grew tired of
making a comparatively honest living, so he went
into Parliament, and then turned lawyer and
made a pile. He winds up by saying that every
man in N.S. W. can go and do likewise ; that be-
cause he got work 30 years ago anybody can do
the same to-day : and that Chinamen are never
oat of work. Bat it happens that in the days
when David was lumping coal there was no
Chinese competition worth speaking of, and when
Providence, owing to an awful mistake in identity,
took him from the coals and set him to defending
borse-thieves and extracting lines and costs from
tbe pockets of men who could get no coals to
carry, it did not intend that he should get inflated
and bumptious and stuck-up, and begin to rail at
other men who had not turned lawyers. David
should remember that ail fish can’t bs sharks.
John Maclean of Hawera (N.Z.), has
oceans of cheek. He had a grudge against a
neighbour, so he went and borrowed the latter’s
Run, and then he laid for his enemy for six months
till he got a chance to pot him with the borrowed
implement! John missed after all, however, and
the victim now sees the finger of Providence in
the circumstance that he lost all his cash in wild
cats years ago, for then the bailiffs levied on his
breechloader, and almost everything else, and as
he was too poor to buy another good weapon the
one he lent to Maclean was an old blunderbuss

“ How is it,” asks a London newspaper
correspondent, “that the two most important
British commands, naval and military, are at this
moment in the hands of Gormans ? Wo have the
ommand at the Noro, the gateway of the Thames,
leading to London, committed to one of the Lein-
ingens, whose principal sea service exploit was,
when in command of one of the Royal yachts,
running down the Mistletoe. The army in Ireland
is commanded by Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar,
who was the despair of the umpires at sham-fights
whenever he had charge of troops.”
Colonel Disney remarked proudly at the
Melbourne Mayoral banquet a short time ago
that “ in the event of war breaking out in Europe
he felt sure that they would look with confidence
to the men of the colony to shoulder a rifle and
fight for the country.” Of course. So would we.
But we would also look forward with the same
cheerful expectation to a small minority of the
men to shoulder their rifles —and pawn them.
Some of them would probably be even mean
enough to sell the enemy the tickets. But taking
it for all in all there is a lot of patriotism in Vic-
toria —at banquets.
Some paper or person stated a little time
ago that if England were to engage in a great war
she might have some difficulty in raising the
money necessary to carry it on. A warlike writer
in the Melbourne Herald points out that more
money was subscribed to buy Guinness’s Brewery
than w’ould be necessary for three wars, and from
this fact draws the patriotic conclusion that there
will be no trouble in getting money whenever
England chooses to fight. Gallant, but misjudged
enthusiast ! He forgets the radical difference be-
tween the two things—Blood and Beer. sou put
your money in blood, and probably lose it ; you
put it in beer, and it comes back to you increased
seven-fold. Patriotism is a very good investment
in time of peace, but when war threatens there is
nothing as sa'e as beer.
A few weeks ago there was but one royal
family in Europe—that of Russia —which seemed
free from the i aint of hereditary insanity. This
exception has now been wiped out, for the Czar
is mad. He has become so through suspense and
crazy unreasoning terror, but yet this man
coarse, insane and commonplace—is. as before, the
absolute ruler of a hundred million souls. All
night he walks about, muttering, thinking, dream-
ing, and looking round for imaginary enemies ;
not long since he shot dead an officer who ap-
peared with his tunic unbuttoned, because he
fancied he had unfastened it that he might draw
some weapon hidden underneath, but the life ot
an offioer does not count for much when the
Lord’s annointed ” is frenzied with ceaseless
fear. It is one of the joys of hereditary mon-
archy—and hereditary lunacy—to be ruled—and
shot on sight—by a man like this, who can t be

The Victorian Presbyterians have sent a
mournful petition to her Gracious, &c., beseeching
her in mournful numbers to so influence her
Government, that it will, without more ado, toss
the unregenerate Frenchman from the New

able missionaries, they say, have been destroyed
by the hungry natives, and a number more valu-
able lives lost by other climatic influences. God
has given them 9000 converts, and 50,000 so far
civilised as to wear some clothing—counting in

several tribes who have co’oured socks and brace

“ Bismarck s policy,” says a London

German subjects over which she stiil rules. The German
Chancellor has .already declared that Austria's centre o:
gravity is tho East. But Russia will make short work O:
Austria-Hungary in the interests of Panslavism when she is
abandoned by Prince Bismarck for a price. The price wi
he the annexation of the German lands held by Austria, and
tho completion of German unity by making the Empire co-
extensive with the German race, not excluding the Dutch
ports and a seaboard. To extend, complete, and round off
the German Empire is the dream of Prince Bismark’s ima-
gination. But he is not the man to dream dreams only ; be
converts them into living realities. To achieve this end, he
will allow Hutsia to have her fling in the South-East of
Mnroi e ; and, since England to-day counts for nothing, to
carry out the design and the dream of Peter the Great ly
establishing Russia’s seat of power at Constantinople
Allied with Russia, Prince Bismarck may then defy Prame

8o lung as tho laws of England are made
ami administered by tho rich for tho rich it is
vain to dream of any amelioration in the condith u
of the masses. It seems that a working man,
driven by destitution to the “ Union ” door,
breaks some statute or another in daring to put
his own price upon his labour. This we gather
from tho fact that Henry Shodd, a native of tho
“glorious o.’d country,” was sentenced to one
month's hard labour and 12 strokes of the cat for
refusing work offered him at three shillings a day
and electing to enter the workhouse. The magis
trate in this case was a lawyer and it is pretty
certain that his sentence was well within the
limits of tho law. It is also certain that Henry
Shedd was standing out for a principle in acting
as he did, and that the 12 lashes were intended to
convince him that starving labourers must have
no principles. It would be interesting to know
the very low-est wage which can be offered, with
the cat as an alternative. Perhaps one shilling
per week. But even taking the case of Henry
Shedd as it stands, we have the spectacle of the
British capitalist standing at a workhouse do< r
with a cat-o -nine-tails in one hand and 3 shillings
in the other, offering hungry applicants their
choice between the two.
The Germans are the 'coming race. In
London there are now 150,000 of them, and almi sfc

Half the members of the Stock Exchange and one
fifth of the great city merchants arc German?,
and these are almost without exception the richest
of the London plutocrats. Two thirds of the great
fortunes made in tho capital of late years are in
the bands of the Teutons, and the other third are
scrambled for by Jews, Americans, and Greeks.
Three Germans boss the iron, copper, and t'n
markets respectively, and if one of these says that
the price of his particular metal is to go down all
England cannot hold it up. They are graduaby
monopolising flic banking trade, too, and to al
appearance the only men who can really compete
with them are the Greeks. As for the EntlishtJ
men, their conservatism, their extraordinary
ignorance, slowness, stupidity, and conceit are
putting them out of the race. They got up their
mercantile reputation only when they were free
from foreign competition ; now they are being
beaten on their own ground. Even the English
journals reflect the wooden-headedness of the
nation. From the Times down to the humblest
provincial rag they bear the one character—
chloroform and lead, edited by a corpse, and you
couldn’t fire a Gatling gun into a graveyard vyith
out riddling a dozen gayer corpses than the
average English editor.
The balance-sheets of Guinness’s brewery
show that during the last four years the concern
has netted £150,000 per annum. The figures are

pocket over £lOO,OOO annually of not profits.
A ship’s name-board, evidently belonging

perhaps the fastest ship that ever sailed the seas
Twelve months ago the stocks of Indian
gold mines were quoted at an average of from

in Scotland, where small quantities of the precious
metal have been procured from time to time ever
since the days of James V., it is believed that
payable yields—payable anyhow to the brokers —
will yet be obtained, and there arc vague whispers
abouta great brokers’ —gold-boom which is about
to break out in Wales
The old lambing-down style is played out’
This is how they do it in Jabbaloo. A policeman
goes round the big sheds just before cgtting-out
and volunteers to take any cheques or money to
Jabbaloo and leave same in the banker at a store for
the shearers. Many jump at the offer, knowing the
temptations in the way. The shearers repair to
Jabbaloo, but the policeman is away on duty, and
the publicans tick the wool-choppers for a week
or so. In the dead of night the cheques are
handed to the respective publicans. Next morn'
ing the boys are primed with whisky before
boniface produces the little bit of paper, and—“ as
it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
be! Amen and amen.” Round ’em up again,

We rise to report that a Scotch doctor has
made a joke. He is employed on a contractor’s
camp somewhere in N.S.W., and is paid by a

other day the nasty man of the camp got drunk
and bailed un the medico, telling him he'd be

from his buggy and exclaimed in the paetic lan-

man. Let me see your tongue.” The lout looked
stupefied and solemnly rent asunder a huge pair
of jaws; a moment later he tried to close them
but the jalap-broker had got in a pair of pincers,
and when he brought them out again a large tooth
came along with them. “That’s ten shillings’
worth, so you’ve got the value of your money,”

and drove away, and the navvy, squatting on a

No doubt, so would we. But we think this was
an insult that Mr. Chief Justice Dailey has not
yet earned. When we consider that like the
Roman Quintus Cu-rtius he has leapt ihto the
gulf, and with a nobility all his own has accepted
a poor £B5BO per ahnilrn, a pension, of £2OOO, a
knighthood, and the Lieutenant- Governorship in
the distance, it will bo understood -what a truly
patriotic man we have in Australia. It goes to
show that the artificial state of society wherein we
live has failed to obliterate from the bun an heart the
best and noblest instincts of our nature. Given
the occasion, and the man of sacrifices comes
forth. Given £3500 a y-eur, and the highest dig-
nity in the land, and such is the splendid public
spirit of the day that a citizen can be found who
will accept the painful position. Nothing since
when Dan O’Connor stepped in and saved his
bleeding country by becoming Postmaster General
has been so done. We thought that when
Sir John Robertson accepted that £lO,OOO he tad
come as nqar the noble Roman as a man without
wings can get. But we were wrong. It still re-
mained possible to go one better, and accept the
Chief-Justiceship of N.S.W. When the present
shall have grown dim in the mists of ages,
when Dalley shall be a misty memory and there
are conflicting opinions regarding the Soudan
donkey, when Manly’s little boy shall be among
the cherubim, the travelled Ilotentot sitting on the
ruins of the Sydney Post-office carvings will muse
upon the glorious pastof that people who were able
to rear a man capable of the noblest triumphs of
self-sacrifice.

Speaking of Lady Carington’s last Thurs-
day “ At Home,” “Humming Bee” writes: “ Of
course everyone noticed the Marchioness of Staf-
ford, now a guest at Government House. Her
ladyship was gowned in white, with a brown
sailor hat trimmed with red ribbon.” Fancy that!
The Marchioness wasn’t dressed, dontchcrknow.
She was—ahem !—“ gowned.”

That illustrious bread-waggon officer, Sir
E. Strickland, K.C.8., who seems to have been
the real author of the Soudan Filibustering Expe-
difcioh, has got it into his head that Queen Vic-
toria wants a shield. The General does not say
whether the old lady is going to take an active
part in the next Zulu war or not, but we fancy
she “has it in contemplation,” and has given the
General the straight tip. The shield is to cost
£lOO0 —a good sum, but not too much when we
come to consider its many uses, and no one is to
contribute more than one guinea. The idea of the
shield is good whichever way you take it. It’ll
do for a cradle for little Bat. It’s not bad as a
foot-bath, and as a, pie-dish it will come in handy.
No doubt a soft-bottomed chair and a foot-warmer
would have been more serviceable to the Royal
consumer of the succulent peppermint, but a
shield is good. Probably £lOOO was never put to
a better Use i it might have been wasted in re-
lieving the sufferers by the late shipwreck. Money
is so dreadfully fooled away by some folks.

Another sample of cdrnstitlk politeness

New Zealand still goes in for ‘ nominated
mmigration, and settlers who send home for their
riends very often find that they have imported
rouble as well as relatives for themselves. A
sapier man lately nominated his brother, and on
ns arrival left him in charge of his house and
,-oung wife while he went up country on business.
Returning one night late and unexpected, he
iound that his wife and brother had taken his de-
mise for granted, and had consulted-with Moses as
Lo their subsequent duty to each other, and acted
accordingly. On making this discovery the en-
raged husband seized a poker and argued success-
fully therewith that the Mosaic dispensation did
not in this case apply. When he had convinced
them into a state of coma by the force of his argu-
ments he furthermore “grabbed them by the wool,”
and dragged them out of doors to cool their heads
while he went up to the garret to load his rifle.
Fortunately, however, some Maoris who heardthe
hubbub rescued the delinquents before he had time
to send them to Jericho in search of Moses.

The.two Scottish gentlemen who wrote
“ Populaire” have left their mark upon the sands
of time in a way they little expected, for those
who witnessed the production of this "comic” opera
at Government House, Sydney, last week, have hot
cten yet recovered from the shock. The authors
have crowded the piece with allusions to “ sweat’’
and “perspiratioh” and “ beef ” Until it reads like a
prtrody on a butcher’s shop, and when one of the
characters tells another that ho is short of
“lights” the impression gains ground that
“ Populaire ” is somewhat lacking in that high
tone which alone could gain for it the fatoUt
of Potts Point, For in 3 tali ce, the following
dialogue is calculated to demoralise a whole dearth
ing-school
Enter George, muffled up, preparatory to taking a sweating
walk.
Georoe : Daughters of ray native land, I salute you.
All ; And, champion of our shores, we return it.
Muriel : Are you cold ?
Georoe: No, I am not cold, but my trainer says I am too
beefy.
Muriel : What is that ?
Georoe : Too much flesh on me. It will all come off after
a 20-mile spin.
Am. : What 1 in pieces?
Georoe : No, ladies, in perspiration.
Ann :Oh !—oh !—oh !
George takes his spin, and on his return, while
his trainer io throwing water over him, the
dialogue goes on :
Muriel : lias he lo§t any btef f . .
SPAVIN; Well, Bliss, ,hfe was a trine beefy at thfc statt)
hut i real thdt he Mas pullbd Up a trifle groggy:
I’ll strip huh presfentiy, and rtih hlrti dowfi
before he gets his feed. ~ . ,
Muriel : You talk about him as if he were a horso.
From beef to grog appears only to remove tile
alleged satire from a slaughter-yard to a public-
house, and when the opera reached this point
there was sUch a look of froz'on meat about the
audience that Lady Caritlgton bbgan to fear they
were not enjoying themsWvOs. Ilbr ladyship wa? as-
sured, however, that refflly aristocratic Aiistralirtnfj
always looked like that when steeped in prbfotinQ
unfatnomable bliss, and the perforfnancO went dii
pretty smoothly until this remarkable uttcrahbS
came to the front :
Charlie : Perhaps pluck goes further than muscle.
Spavin: What’s the good of “pluck” without “lights.”
Why, you’re as narrow-i bested as a curlew.
Spavin goes on to sing the story of a narrow-
chested young man without “ lights ” who lost a
race and then—slaughter once more !- cut his
throat. He missed his mark, however, and got
three months for the attempt. After this there is
one solemn joke, but it is so long in coming that
it loses its point. George comes back laden with
trophies, and his trainer says poetically, “ Yes,
them's the jugs.” Evidently the two Scotch
gentlemen who wrote “ Populaire ” were too sad
for the work, and after enduring their parody on
Muscle it is a relief to hear that Beach is engaged
writing a lightsome satire on Brains, which is
also to be produced at Government House. Beach

Quiet, modest, unostentatious liberality
such as the following shoiild nothe allowed to pass
unnoticed ;
“ As an evidence of the thoughtfulness and liberality of
our citizens towards the inmates of our charitable institu-
tions, more particularly during the Christmas season, our
attention has been drawn to an advertisement, appearing in
the Herald, from the superintendent of the Kandwick
Asylum, notifying thereceipt of a very handsome donation
from Mrs, L. W. Levy, of Macleay-street. We are informed
that Mrs. Levy visited the institution yesterday and caused
the very acceptable gif's to be transferred from her carriage
to the superintendent.”
Need we say that it is the S. M. Herald which
holds up this touching example for imitation by a
purse-proud bourgeoisie?

This is a true bill. Up the country some
ladies drove over on-? day to visit a neighbouring
squatter. He was very anxious for them to stay
all night, and even w T ent so far as to say that their
horse was dead lame and could not take them home.
They said they must go, and that he would have
to lend them a horse. Now, being a man of ex-
perience and net being particularly anxious to
lend any of his horses to ladies, he got their horse,
the supposed lame animal, whitened his face and
three legs, and started them off with instructions
I not to spare the wTrip, as the horse was very lazy.
A woman will always overdrive a horse ; she will
extra overdrive him when he is borrowed, and
when the is told to heat him it is a case of Lord help
him. So they sent this moke along in style, whip and
umbrellas going all the time. When they arrived
homo they told the master of the house that “ Mr.
Johnson lent us a horse, such a lazy brute, and
told us to beat him well.” Then the boss went
out, and after viewing the distressed moke for a
few minutes, he recognised his favourite buggy
horse, and saw through the affair. Then he joined
all women, Johnsons, and horses in one fearful
malediction, and sent the nag round and had him
washed clean. There is a coolness now between
those families.

A squatter out West has a “ loan ” horse.
He lives near a fairly largo town, and when any
of his numerous friends are stopping there, they
always, ask him for “ the lend of a hoive” and he
always sends this one with a message that “ You
must be a bit careful getting on it.” The animal
has a trick of wheeling sharply round when any
one is getting on ; the result invariably is that the
would-be borrower returns him next morning
with a polite note saying that he has decided not
to go out. at present, and takes temporary quarters
in the hospital. Now this nag began to get old


and the squatter thought of selling him. He had
no sooner announced his intention of so doing
than the three medical men of the town sub-
scribed about double the horse’s value as an in-
ducement for the squatter to keep him, saying
that if he went they would lose their best friend.
As they remarked, “He is a very quiet horse—you
only have to be a bib careful getting on.”

The course of true love wouldn't run very
smooth if all the girls wore like Lottie Jackson,
Lottie —it came out in a London police court—is
an actress of jealous temperament and sleuth-
hound determination. We don’t know what a
sleuth-hound is, but the simile reads well. To re-
turn to our Lottie, however, it seems that she
“ suspected the fidelity ” of her best young man.
Not being one of those girls who are content to
chew the cud of suspicion and equalise matters by
hugging another fellow, Lottie put on male attire
and tracked hergiddy Augustus. Sho saw him enter
a railway-carriage with two sweet things in golden
hair and dress-improvers. She also entered the
carriage. And now, mark the inconsistency of
the sex. Lottie hit one of the girli, in the eye,
pulled off the other one’s bonnet, and-left the
faithless Augustus unscathed. It is positively
alarming to find that this exacting maiden was
discharged with a caution. Speaking as an en-
gaged young man, we think they ought to have
made an example of Lottie.

The London correspondent of the Canter-

lucubrations by “A Peeress, the Daughter of a
Powerful Duke,” which appear in tha Sydney
Town and Country Journal, and which have
excited so much derision in all quarters, are the
work of Lady Colin Campbell, who, by the way, is
neither a peeress nor the daughter of a duke. If
this statement is correct (and w r o see little reason
for doubting its accuracy in view of the facts that
Lady Colin has from time to time offered work to
more than one colonial paper, and that the letters
themselves contain internal evidence pointing to
the lady named as their writer), the lengthy and
s iggestive telegrams wdiich are now almost daily
appearing in the E. News re the progress of the
Campbell divorce case at once acquire an addi-
tional amount of interest. And so do the letters
given some time ago by “the Peeress” as speci-
mens of the private correspondence of the Prince
of Wale?, concerning whom, it has been broadly
alleged, Lady Colin knows a good deal more than

am 43 years old, so it must have been about ’63. I
had learned to drink “brandy-hot” and was
doing so in Birkenhead. Two turfites Were pre-
sent. They had each a horse in a selling-race at
Chester next day, and there were only throe
horses in the race. Mr. B. gave Mr. T. £lOO on
condition that he would let Ms jock, wait on B.’s
horse until within the distance. Ho then gave
his own rider strict orders not to pass T.’s horse
on. any account until within the rails. Tho third
horse, which belonged to a farmer and had no
show against the others if fairly ridden, came in
an easy winner whilst his opponents were trot-
ting at the back of the course. Mr. B. netted
£5OO by backing the farmer through a commission-
agent.
* * *
In ’O5 I was serving my Queen and country
in the shiny East at Allahabad. Captain U— had
(lie best “ W.aler ” horses in Indio. Two of them,
Prince Alfred and Bonnie Morn, were in tho big
race. Now, the betting in India in those days
was all done by tho lotteries held in tho clubs and
mess-rooms. D. had failed to buy Bonn o Morn
in the sweeps, as sho was bid up by a staff-officer
from the Hissar stud. My friend, Baron Bob, of
Port Jackson, knows that officers are commis-
sioned as “ our trusty and well-beloved Cham-
pagne Charlie, gentlemen, greeting.” No suspi-
cion of roping was attached to any officer in those
days, and D. was the best rider I have ever secn-~
i do not except George Fordham or Tom Halos.
He rode so well that Bonnie Morn lost 50 lengths
behind a tope (clump) of palm-trees at tho far
side of the course, and Prince Alfred, ridden by
little Collins, an English professional in the em-
ploy of Captain D., won by half a length. I regret
exceedingly to state that the Indian turf lost tho
patronage of the owner of the first and second
horses soon after, as he paid a visit to Coventry
on the recommendation of the Calcutta Turf Club.
Skipping the doings of commoners, I shall
touch on Royalty lirst, to cut out the paid Peeress
of Potts Point. Fitz-George is the name by which
the sons of tho Duke of Cambridge pass muster.
One of them was A.D.C. at Gibraltar in ’67. A
better fellow never lived. Ilis hobby was walk-
ing. I think he feared tho Hanoverian adiposity.
Every morning he used to struggle up the rock,
into the galleries, have a look with a field-glass at
the gallops on the neutral ground, up to the Rock
Gun, coffee with the keeper, and back to the
bathing-place at Rosia Bay. A few days before
the races a trial was got up for his benefit. A
barb called Rabat gave an Arab, Rothesay, a great
doing. They were actually started by a signal
(the dropping of a red silk handkerchief) from the
very embrasure in which Fitz-George was stand-
ing. A friend met him accidentally and accom-
panied him in his walk. Rothesay won the “ Barb
and Arab Maiden,” and our chip of Royalty dropped
£2OOO. A telegram to H.R.H. brought the money
and the loser gambled no more. If I were to meet
him in Sydney now he would trust me in prefer-
ence to Captains B and S , of the crack
Light Infantry regiment that was with him in
Gibraltar, and I am only a turf-tout,
* *
Thus you sec, my young friends, that it’s
better biz. to head-’em or to buy lollies, than to
back a horse, unless he is a certainty and you are
in the swim.

The National Permanent Building
Land and Investment Society.
The history of the operations of these institutions
of the people classed under the general head of
land and building companies is yet to be written.
But when that work is done it will ho found to
show almost a revolution in tho condition of the
people of this country, as by their moans we have
quietly being accomplished here what centuries of
political combat and oven tho conflict of arms
have failed to secure for tho old world—tho land,
tho common heritage of man, has here been par-
celled out so as to allow every man to become a
holder of the soil. Withina radius of 15 miles* M f
Sydney largo estates held intact frflm the first
day the flag was heisted tu the breeze at
Dawes Point haV e been broken up, and a thou-
sand families found roofs to cover their head
where previously little lords held their sway, and
bellowing herds proclaimed their sovereignty.
One company that has signally done its work
quietly, slowly, surely and solidly - a stylo that
alone permanently Axes the solid, slow going peo-
ple of Sydney—is the National Permanent Build-
ing Land and Investment Society. In its un-
pretentious ofllco in Park-street this company has
carried on a safe and going business, aiming and
securing in every instance an unchallengable solid
average—an average which gave just and legiti-
mate returns to the company, and at the
same time secured the public in the posses-
sion of land and buildings, to which were
not, by auctioneering or contract dodges, given
forced or speculative values. The National
all through its operations, has held to the one
principle of letting the public set their own values
on their estate —that is, the directors and manage!'
have steadfastly shut their faces against arranging
with contract-builders on the high percentage
principle, with whose aid the land is given a
fictitious, temporary value; consequently the
transactions of the Company have worked out
with signal success, less buildiugs or land pur-
chases being thrown back on their hands, than
was ever previously experienced. With this
solid, even success, the Company have been able
to erect splendid new offices in Pitt-street, a small
sketch of which is here given. The building is
like the company—solid and strong. The officers
will actually give free office accommodation to the
Company, and at the same time a return on the
capital. The dii ectors are Messrs. J. B. Gibbs, Mr.
J. Broomfield, Mr. F. A. Wright, Mr. Ellis Robin-
son, Mr. W. Hentsch, Mr. 11. Chapman, Mr. J.
H. Carruthers, and Mr. W. H. Paling, and the
manager is Mr. James A. Todd, a capable and re-
liable man of business. The company have just
recently secured a portion of the celebrated
Cooper Estate, a city property, and have resolved
on disposing of it privately. They have already
the plans out, and have resolved on asking only
50s. per lot deposit, and the balance at 20s. per
each £lOO, including 6 per cent, interest, virtually
ten years’ terms, with Torrens Title. This is vir-
tually Sydney city property, and is reached by
tram, but more particulars will be forthcoming in
a future article’
The Proposed East Perth Freehold
Land Company.
The fact of English and Australian capital con-
tinuing to flow into Western Australia —and
especially its capital, Perth—gives additional in-
terest to the proposed formation in Sydney of the
East Perth Freehold Land Company. The general
opinion among people visiting the capital of our
great Western colony, is that it presents at this
moment the same opportunities to land investors
and others which Sydney presented 50 years, and
Melbourne 30 years, ago. The West Australian
coast is nearest Europe, and at no distant day it
must be the first point of arrival of the great mail
and ocean steamers. This, together with the
great railway undertakings already in hand, must
give the place the impetus so long needed. Pri-
vate letters from Sydney people who have settled
in Perth say that the place is soundly prosperous
and must go ahead ; and that Freeraantle and
Perth must become great centres tf maritime
trade owing to the enormous stretch of coast-line
and the wealth of the newly-discovered coast
country and harbours, from which facts
the venture can be confidently recom-
mended. The projectors of the company
have decided on a solid, good programme
in forming a company to purchase the East Perth
Estate, consisting of 806 acres, and similarly
situated to the city itself as Newtown or the Glebe
is to Sydney, being only half-a-mile from the city
boundary. This estate is already a railway
suburb, as the Government railway line runs right
through the city and right through to the property
and connects with the Great Hordern line now
being built by English capital. The owners ask
at the rate of £25 per acre for this, while portions
sold have brought up to an average of £75 per
acre, the total of £lOOO being carried to the credit
of the company. 'Jhe terms are £BOOO in cash,
£6OOO paid up shares, and £6OOO to remain at 6 per
cent, for five years. It will be unnecessary to call
up more than £13,000 unless the company decide
on erecting buildings on the plan which has given
some of the Sydney building companies a huge
and vastly improving interest in all the suburls
of Sydney. The East 1 erth Estate has communi-
tion with the city by road, rail, and river, and is
consequently convenient to the city. Tire capital
of the company is £30,000 in £1 shares, payable*
on these very easy and very attractive terms, viz.*
Is. on application, Is. on allotment, and 1?., if rej
quired, at intervals of not le.-s than two month?.
The provincial directors are the following w r ell
known Sydney men, namely, Mr. John See,
M.L.A., Chairman ; Mr. W. Frazer Nor tor, J,P.;
Mr. J, G. Grifßn ; Mr. John Bennnet; Mr. R. 1.
Murray ; Mr. E. G. Barker. The Broker to the
company is Mr. Marshall Bayley, of 19 Bridge I
street, Sydney. The support accorded the com'
pany already ind’cates early operations.

The Autophone is a wonderful Kttle instrument
which, while it weighs less than three pounds has
the lungs of a full sized parlor organ, and executes
its music with absolute precision and perfect
effect. It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three
keys, and all the parts of most difficult music. On
it a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, which at present consists of ever
300 selections from hymns, oratorios, operas,
waltzes, polkas, marches, popular songs, &o. It
is best adapted, to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, but also- has wonderful power in exe-
cuting very lively pieces, m 1 It is pitched for the
voice, and has a little card holder for convenience
in singing. It is entirely well adapted for country
churches, Sunday schools, the family circle, and
also for dancing. The music is compact, and far
cheaper than that which is made for any organette.
The Autophone is like every other good thing, the
longer you have it the better you like it, and as
new music is being published every week it has an
endless fund of amusement in it.

The above is a faithful likeness of the man who
says that rheumatism is an invention of the devil.
He is a gentleman and a scholar ; speaks several
anguages, and has got the biggest foot in Aus-
tralia.
He is very wealthy and good-looking; has
plenty of friends, but his clothes don’t fit him,
He has completely used up every profane word
the Colonial and other languages, still he is not
nappy.
He says there is enough thoroughbred agony
and hellish torture in his foot to kill every sinner
n creation.
He has been a Member of Parliament, a Minister
of the Crown, and an Alderman, but does not re-
member having done anything to deserve his
sufferings.
He has always been devout; and at one period
of his life a government contractor.
He has tried all the doctors and nearly every-
thing under the sun, but the villain still pursues
him.
He tells everybody that trying to cure rheu-
matism is like trying to shovel wind off the roof.
Or trying to get a sinecure in the Civil Service
without friends in the House, or marrying into a
high-toned family.
He says that rheumatism cannot be cured. Hi 8
grandfather told him so. And he thinks that
settles it.
He is sadly mistaken. It is a fact that a remedy
has been found which relieves and cures rheu-
matism, just as sure as the sun shines in the
heavens. It is used externally. It conquers pain
It goes right to the spot. It cures when every-
thing else has failed. It penetrates to the seat of
the disease. It is simple. It is safe. It is cer-
tain.
Mr. James Marlow, merchant tailor, 11, Flinders-
street East, Melbourne, was under medical treat-
ment for rheumatism for months at a time, and
suflered severely both in health and pocket. He
tried all sorts of remedies without obtaining rePef,
until he got St. Jacobs uil, when “ the first appli-
cation gave me instant relief, and I am thankful
to say that I have not experienced the slightest
symptom of pain ever since.”
Edward Evans, formerly with Davey and Moore,
London, was declared incurable at three hospitals.
He was nearly crazy from rheumatism. The
doctors said he must die. St. Jacobs Oil cured
him. He says: “It saved my life.” William
Beach, champion oarsman of the world, writes :
“ I gladly endorse St. Jacobs Oil. It conquers
pain.”
Maurice D, Benjamin, Esq., importer and whole-
sale merchant, late of Brisbane, Queensland,
writes ;—“ I had my doubts at first of St. Jacobs
Oil eradicating rheumatism ; but as I have practi-
cally tested its efficacy, I can honestly state that
it has wonderful rheumatic healing qualities.”
Henry Ricketts, Westbury, Gloucestershire, was
pronounced incurable at Bath Hospital. His pains
were terrible. St. Jacobs Oil cured him. After
practical tests on invalids in hospitals and else-
where, St. Jacobs Oil was awarded six gold medals
in America, Australia, and India. It has cured
people who had been crippled from pain for over
20 years.
William Gitechink, a stoker, belonging to
H.I.M.S. Albatross, was compelled to remain in
Auckland when the Albatross sailed for Samoa,
on account of his dreadful sufferings from rheu-
matism. He says:—“I have now perfectly re-
covered, and it is entirely owing to the free appli-
cation of your wonderful remedy—St. Jacobs Oil.”
A CASH reward of £100 will be paid by the
CHARLES A. VOGLER COMPANY, of BALTI-
MORE, MARYLAND, UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, proprietors of St. Jacobs Oil, or by
their accredited local representatives, to any per-
son producing proof to the effect that the testi-
monials published by them in regard to St. Jacobs
Oil are not strictly genuine.

Sheep-Farming in N.S.W. —'Wool, which is the

the latest statistics, being sent away in larger

has considerable attractions. Formerly the pur-
suit was attended with a certain amount of risk,
and the great distance from the station that a
doctor could be found necessarily increased the
danger when illness occured. The introduction of
Freeman’s Original Chlorodyne has dispelled this
alarm, as the she ?D-f armors know this invaluable
remedy to be a compendious medicine chest in
itself, and a specific for all the diseases incidental

THE HALE WAS NEVER TOLD
Of the wonderful powers and virtues of that best of all medi-
cines, Dr. Bell's Bitters. It has been tried and proved. Its
cases are numberless, and the record of supposed incurable
cases that have yielded to its influence is astounding. If
you have trouble with your kidneys, liver, or bowels, if you
suffer from constipation or piles, if you are a victim of rheu-
matism or malaria, take Dr. Bell's Bitters. You will find it
the remedy you need.
THOSE TRAMS AGAIN.
To the Editor.
Sir, —No one can travel half an hour in our
clean tramoars without a grievance. Either
somebody tramples on his toes, or the conductor
is too surly or too fresh. If the car is crowded he
is obliged to hang on the platform and get
squeezed against the rail, all the time haunted by
the horrible suspicion that somebody is picking
his pocket. There is a certain class of citizens
who are very disagreeable fellow-passangera on a
street car. They are a loud-talking, grinning,
boisterous lot, one of whom will not hesitate to
bellow an anecdote of how he got the best of a
brother dealer in the matter of 50 cases of over-
alls over a stranger’s shoulders, and in regard to
■ pushing and jostling these ruffians are particularly
violent and forward. The only method of self-
vindication is to tramp on their toes. They are
nearly all martys at the corn and bunion shrine,
and when this punishment is properly administered
they will have no voice for anything but dismal
groans during the rest of the journey. The ladies
often distinguish themselves in the nuisance line.
If, when standing up and hanging on to the
straps, an unfortunate citizen chances to bump
against them they favor him with a ferocious
“ tell- my - big - brother - and - have - you - licked ”
glance, making no allowance for the awkwar4ness
of his position. Some read the papers and tickle
your ribs with their elbows, or suddenly choke
with laughter as they fall across one of the funny
advertisements of Summerflcld and Company, the
well-known tailors and great juvenile outfitters,

One of the leading bakers of Sydney
admits that he has lost £2O per week by the scan-

all loaves shall be full weight.
Mndgee Taylor writes : —“ Being confined
to my room through an accident to my foot, I have
been obliged to suspend the publication of my
political criticisms till I get better.” We al-
ways did think that with his feet.
Sarah Howard got three months for steal-
ing Father O’Meara’s vestments from a Melbourne
church. Rum and religious feeling were at the
bottom of Sarah’s trouble. She merely borrowed
those vestments to frighten away “ all the devils
of hell.” Unfortunately the one who took Sarah
in charge refused to be frightened.
The evidence of the Campbell divorce
case is said to be “ more repulsive in its un-
clean character than any ever given in an Eng-
lish court of law.” So far, Lady Colin has rather
the worst of the argument, and one of her wit-
nesses, a lady friend, who alleges that she saw
certain naughty things going on, has been clean
bowled out by the medical evidence.
There were some ghastly omens at the
Mount Ronnie trial. Firstly, the prisoners had
the hick to bo tried before Judge Windeyer, who
is not a “ soft ” man, and who, if he believes a
man to be guilty, generally manages to let the jury
see it. Noxtly, a certain very well known under-
taker was, during the progress of the case, con-
stantly and prominently en evidence. “ Nosey
Bob,” the hangman, bustled in and out of the
court a good many times, and for some hours ex-
hibited his hideous countenance to the assembled
Spectators.

to wait.” Stephenson (the informer) and Lambert,
the principal witnesses for the prosecution in the
great N.S.W. railway-fraud cases, have skipped
beyond the ken of the detectives. The Crown
has consequently applied for a further postpone-
ment of this interminable trial, which, after oc-
cupying the Police Court for a few weeks, went
into the Supreme Court, where, after making a
juror very ill, it helped to kill the presiding judge,
the late lamented Sir James Martin, C.J. It
would ha interesting to know the amount already
expended by the Crown in feeing counsel in this
monstrous legal juggle. The defendants, who at
this their second trial have put in a plpa of “ de-
fence,” contend that as the jury who sat before
Sir James Martin intimated, after the judge’s
death, that they were ready with their verdict,
and as that jury has never been formally dis-
charged, it is illegal now to proceed further with
the charges. A queer fact in connection with this
second trial is that a woman is at the bottom of it
—that, in fact, it has been in one sense brought
about by a buxom servant girl.
PREJUDICE.
Surry Hills, 364 Cleveland St. (Sydney)
N.S.W., May 1, 1886. —About the beginning of
last December I was taken with what some call
the Colonial Fever. I shook from head to foot,
accompanied with cold clammy perspiration, was
exceedingly nervous, and had aching pains all
over my body. My appetite failed, and I was
thought to be near my end. During this time I
was attended by medical men without the least
beneficial result. I was advised to try Warner’s
safe cure. My preiudice against proprietary
medicines was such that, although I had the best
evidence of the value of the medicine, I did not
for some time try it; when I did, however, I had
not taken more than two bottles when I began to
prove its value. Eight bottles taken and 1 was at
work again quite well.-
JOHN HAYES.
CURED THE BANK MANAGER.
National Bank of Australia, n,
S.A., July 27, 1886. —When I was a boy, I 1 . d
what Dr. Crooks, of Melbourne, staged t»'*„ a
severe attack of dropsy, and ever sinct, ■ L re-
cently, I have suffered from pain and wed. ness in
the small of my hack. A few months ago the pain
increased considerably, and I felt the same drow-
siness that I experienced before I had dropsy.
Seeing that Warner's safe cure was advertised &S
a remedy for kidney disease, I procured and took
one bottle, and then another I did not seem to
get much benefit from them, but being determined
to give it a fair trial, purchased half a dozen
bottles. Before I had finished the third bottle, I
felt considerably better, and after the fourth, was
completely cured, not having felt any pain or
drowsiness since. lam letting a friend have the
remaining bottles, for I don’t think I shall need
any more. —E. M’MICHAEL,
IN PRISON.
“ I see,” said an Adelaide gentleman who was
arrested, tried, and convicted a short time ago for
an offence which startled the whole community.
“ It’s terrible for a man to be in prison. I suppose
they are not allowed to have a cigar?” “No,
sir.” “ It’s hard. Not even a bottle of that
famous St. Louis lager Beer?” ‘No, sir.’ Just
see what I have lost—health, happiness, and a
good name.
The George Hotel, Market and Pitt-
Streets.
A grand and lofty new hotel, The George, which
has for many months been in course of erection at
the corner of Pitt and Market-streets and adjoin-
ing Her Majesty’s Theatre, has just been opened
by Mr. Harry Payten, the widely-known sports-
man and boniface of Goulburn. Great efforts
were made by the theatre syndical e to secure the
corner for the purpose of a grand theatre hotel,
but the owner, Mr. George Hill, declined the
figure offered, and as a result we have a fine new
hotel that really is of advantage to Sydney. The
George has a grand frontage to Market-street and
rises to a height of six storeys, having on its
summit an expansive promenade “Look Out.”
Deep excavations were made for the basement,
and vast and cool cellarage and store room have
thus been secured. At the corner is a grand
public bar of now design and very elaborately
furnished, and a fine private bar is likewise pro-
vided. On the street level, Market-street side,
is a commodious commercial and reading room—a
feature new to Sydney hotels. This the proprietor
mdans to conduct on a new stylo as far as Sydney
Is concerned, furnishing it with all the latest
newspapers and publications. Privacy, com-
fort, ventilation, and freshness must como
from the bedroom arrangements, and the
architects, Messrs. Rowo and Green, deserve
any amount of credit for the skilful manipulation
of the space available. Baths, &c,, are on every
floor ; lifts travel the whole building for the or-
dinary requirements of the hotel, and, in addi-
tion, there is a ground passenger lift, worked by
hydrajulics, which runs from basement to top-
most area with the greatest facility. On the
ground floor is a spacious dining-room elegantly
furnished, cool, and well lit, and here a first-class
luncheon, in addition to the ordinary table d'hote,
will be served daily. On the same floor, at the
opposite end of the building, is a grand billiard-
MR. HARRY PATTEN.
room fitted -with two of Alcock s best billiard-
tables and all the latest and newest billiard fur-
niture. The cooking is done on the barement,
with splendid ranges. The great feature of the
hotel will be the “ look out ” promenade on the
roof, separated from all other parts of the build-
ing. It commands a view over the house-tops of
all Sydney, of the parks, the harbeur, the ocean,
and the far-distant mountains. It is virtually a
glorious little garden in mid-air, and every breeze
that blow* from the ocean is enjoyed there. Most
N.S. Wales, Victorian, and Queensland people
know the proprietor, Mr. Harry Pay ten. He’s born
to the business, hospitable, yet a capital manager,
that The George will be a big hit in
his hands is simply a certainly. On the
Bth inst. the formal opening of the hotel took
place, and, despite the wet weather a goodly
number of friends were present an an enjoyable
luncheon. Among the guests were Mr. F, Tait,
M.P. ; Mr. D. O'Connor, M.P. ; Messrs. George
Thornton, F. Gann-on, James Allison, Mr. Green,
James Hunt, William Beach, J. Conroy, Mr.
M‘Arthur Webster, Mr. F. Smith, Skarratt,
J. Garling, H. Oxenham, C. Huenerbeiir, Glen-
ister and Ritchie, and Pain, Holdaworlh and Co.
Mr. F. Gannon proposed the health of the proprie-
tor of The George, and referred in very compli-
mentary terms to him both as a sportsman and as
a citizen, and he could not but succeed in Sydney,
seeing .that he was known not only in Sydney but
all over the colonies. Mr. Payton, who received a
grand reception on rising to reply, said his 10
years' experience in the business would enable
him, he thought, to make The George a big
success, and his friends could always count on the
same welcome as of old, After the luncheon the
party were conducted through the hotel, and very
high eulogiums were passed on all concerned in
the erection of the grand edifice.*
An “informer” was badly sold the other
day near Townsville (Q. )• He was a revenue
jackal and made his living by entrapping small
storekeepers into selling him a bottle of whisky
and then laying an information against them.
On his last public appearance he figured as a
bushman on the wallaby, and after laying in his
stores, he almost prayed for some liquor ; it might
save his life in the bush on an emergency, and it
could go down on the account as “ pickles.” It
did go down accordingly—“ one bottle picides,
7s. 6d. ” —and then with a triumphant grin the
snake-juice hunter said : “ My good sir, I have to
inform you that I am an official of the Revenue
Department, and it will be my painful duty to lay
an information against you for having infringed
the law by selling me a bottle of —what’s
this ?” “ It’s pickles, my good fellow,” said the
storekeeper, blandly. “ Seven-and-six ; pickles is
riz in price, you see. I knew your hang-dog mug
the instant you came in. But they’re awfully
good pickles and they’re worth the money any-
where. Got out, or I’ll cowhide you'down the
street.” The revenue man “got.”
