HASTINGS, SUSSEX.
r pHIS market town and holiday resort is one of the Cinque Ports,
and was known as a settlement in Anglo-Saxon times, becoming
a flourishing town in the Middle Ages. Its places of interest
include the remains of a castle built soon after 1066 when, near by,
was fought the famo.us battle between the Normans under William
and the English under Harold 11. Interesting old churches in
Hastings include All Saints (eleventh century) and St. Clemens
(thirteenth century). In the neighbourhood of Hastings there are
many delightful walks, and from the heights of Fairlight Down is
a magnificent panoramic view which commands the whole sweep
of the coast from Beachy Head to the South Foreland.

AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS.
Angus and Robertson have issued a
catalogue of “New Books and Reprints ’
to be published “between February 1 and
April 30, 1947.” There are 22 publica-
tions in the list, of which four are by
overseas writers, 18 by Australians.
New poetry includes Peter Hopegood’s
Circus at World’s End and Ethel Ander-
son’s Sunday at Yarralumla —which
might be, but presumably is not, a sort
of Coronation Ode for Mr. McKell.
Frank Clune has turned novelist and
written Ben Hall the Bushranger; Arthur
W. Upfield has his aboriginal detective
solving the Death of a Swagman ; and
Henrietta Drake-Brpckman’s The . Fatal
Days is announced as a novel about “the
dark days following the fall of Singapore
and the welcome invasion of Australia
by American troops.”
Among Australian reprints are Francis
Ratcliffe’s Flying Fox and Drifting Sand
arid Twenty Stories and Seven Poems by
Henry Lawson, a selection by Colin Rod-
erick. Mr. Roderick is also represented
by the second volume of his survey of
Australian fiction, Twenty Australian
Novelists. Juveniles include Susan and
the Bogeywomp by Lawson Glassop—a
work that will doubtless be studied
earnestly by Mr. Glassop’s admirers in
the police force and in Tasmania.
It might seem from the list that Aus-
tralian authors are doing well enough,
and that Australian publishing is flour-
ishing. And, up to a point, that is so.
Georgian House, of Melbourne, is adver-
tising two new Australian novels, James
Devaney’s Washdirt and M. Barnard
Eldershaw’s Tomorrow and Tomorrow;
Dymock’s will shortly be publishing Cecil
Mann’s Light in the Valley and Malcolm
Ellis’s Lachlan Macquarie.
But authors are still faced with inter-
minable delays in the publication of their
books. Throughout the war period and
the post-war muddle Australian writers
have been very lucky indeed if they could
have their books brought out in less than
two years after acceptance. At the
moment, because of an extraordinary
rush of novel-writing—stimulated to some
extent by the competitions run by Mel-
bourne “Argus” and Sydney “Telegraph”
and “Herald” —writers can consider
themselves lucky if their manuscripts are
accepted at all.
The publishers have “back lists” of re-
prints which, in fairness to established
authors, they must keep on sale if they
can; they have accumulations of “new”
manuscripts which have been waiting
their turn for publication for a year, two
years, three years. And so what might
be an exceptionally fruitful period for
Australian literature—a period certainly
fruitful as far as writing is concerned —
is likely to turn out comparatively barren
because of the difficulty in having the
works published.
When an Australian writer does
manage to have his book printed, his
troubles are by no means over. There is
the eternal problem of censorship; and
if a writer escapes being banned, he is
taxed in a way that the English authori-
ties have admitted to be unfair. We do
not tax lottery prizes; we do, it appears,
tax literary prizes. And, whether his re-
ceipts are from a prize or from royalties,
we do not take an average of a writer’s
earnings over a period of years, as they
do in England, but add his literary earn-
ings to his income from other sources and
tax the lot together. Obviously, the taxa-
tion anomalies could be corrected over-
night.
The publishing problem is more diffi-
cult. It will gradually become easier as
trade conditions return to normal; but
while strikes hold up supplies of paper
and machinery or—as happens whenever
the electricity supply is interrupted—
bring the printing-works to a standstill,
the publishers are helpless. Perhaps some
of those firms which publish only re-
prints of English and American novels
could include a few Australian books on
their lists occasionally. It will never seem
fair to Australian writers that firms
should specialise in overseas novels while
our own manuscripts go begging for a
publisher.
Writers and journalists who protested
recently against a newspaper report that
Australian books had been “banned”
from entering England were too hasty.
Anxious to conserve dollar exchange, the
British authorities had prohibited the
importing of American books except
under licence and, under the terms on
which the U.S. loan was granted, were
obliged to restrict the entry of Empire
books in the same way. There was no
attempt to discriminate against Australia ;
works of literature will be admitted as
before; and the only Australian pub-
lishers likely to be seriously affected are
those who had been exporting to Eng-
land'quantities of paperbacks, written by
overseas authors but printed in Australia.
But, if Australian books have not been
“banned” in Britain, it remains true, and
of very serious consequence to Austra-
lian writers, that very few of our books
have ever found their way to an English
market. If Stephen Spender or T. S.
Eliot publishes a new book of poems it
is reviewed in Australian newspapers,
sold in Australian bookshops; both
English and American novels are not
only imported into Australia, but, often,
reprinted here. A few Australian novels,
in return, are reprinted in America ; very,
very few in England. Poets of such high
quality as Robert Fitz Gerald, Kenneth
Slessor and Judith Wright are completely
unknown both to English and American
readers.
Judgment in the Solomons.
N’manga’s baby, it appeared, was too-
too-much small feller and bad, like a
devil-devil. So Sam, Mobe and Niola,
N’manga’s male relatives —the men of
her “line” to whom the child belonged
under the tribal-law of Utapua—took
away the infant and buried it.
As District Officer of Santa Cruz,
Hector MacQuarrie had to decide whether
or not this was a proper proceeding ; and
the case forms the central narrative of his
Vouza and the Solomon Islands (Angus
and Robertson). The position was com-
plicated by the fact that the District
Officer’s predecessor had already com-
mitted Sam for trial on a charge of
murder, and he had been sentenced to
death.
But Mr. MacQuafrie’s faithful native
policeman Vouza said “Mobe and Niola
no savvy kill baby,” which meant he
believed they were innocent. Examina-
tion of the accused and N’manga and
other witnesses brought out the state-
ments :
N’manga: The baby was close-up
dead. She objected at first when the
accused said they would bury it, but
eventually gave way, saying; “Yes, take
this piccaninny, for it is no good.”
Eka (a midwife): The baby could cry,
or make a noise. It was already “dead
finish” when taken to be buried.
Wari (a neighbor): She saw Niola wrap
the baby in calico and she heard it make
a noise. It was not the cry of a live baby.
She was sure the baby was dead when
the men took it away.
Niola : “It is work-belong-me to bury
this piccaninny and when I bury it, it
is dead finish.”
A doctor; “This is a lot of rot. That
baby” •
If the baby was dead when buried,
there was no case to answer. Disregard-
ing, so he says, an order from a superior
officer to commit the prisoners for trial,
Mr. MacQuarrie released them and peti-
tioned for the pardon of Sam. The
sequel, after much wrangling, was that
Mr. MacQuarrie was “shot out” of the
Colonial Service.
The author calls this case his “King
Charles’s head” and, up to a point, it is.
His desire to criticise 4he authorities, yet
to be fair and reasonable, makes his
style self-conscious and awkward ; trying
to “tell everything,” yet to criticise a
system rather than individuals, he fails,
at times, to tell anything. If a native
is to be kicked it takes a whole para-
graph of laboriously humorous circum-
locution to say so.
These faults of style are chiefly notice-
able in the early chapters, where the
author is, more or less, giving a general
survey of the system of government in
the Solomons at some (unspecified) period
before the war. Thereafter, when the
author gets down to describing what he
saw of native life, 'the book becomes
both enjoyable and informative. The
best story is of a native “criminal” who,
to celebrate his release, robbed the gaol
stores and ingenuously invited the native
police to the feast.
VARIOUS VERSE.
Miss Woods.
You would see violets and not her eyes;
All else of her a woman. Then her lips,
Most exquisite archer’s bow —and she ?
The rest of her all woman. The surprise
Of never finding what you sought —=
perhaps
The opposite, a woman —made you see
More than a goddess* when you saw Miss
Woods,
Which tricked emotions into longer
moods.
Godhead, you thought, was in her. —
violets.
And archer’s bow, alabaster, and a rose.
The poems had been written in her praise :
Dante, Shakspeare, and a thousand poets
Knew Miss Woods; and, after them, in
prose
All authors sought to limn her in a
phrase . . .
“Most beautiful woman,” was the best
they said.
Most beautiful woman in her face was
read.
So, all the names they gave her could not
mean
More than she was queen in her own time,
Sublime in beauty—How that wealth can
bring
Bitterness in wake, when all you glean
From its gold fields, is subject for a
rhyme ;
And all that you can hope is, too, to sing,
Swelling the band, assuaging moods,
Singing of this beauty, dear Miss Woods.
QUEENSLAND.
F. John Blight.
The Widow.
When Mrs. Lestrange moved up the aisle
of the church
Row after row of heads would turn to
gaze
And admire her stately progress, tall,
black-trailed
{Widows had Royal patronage in those
days).
Her long, proud face composed and pale
as marble;
She was their symbol of dignity and
grief—
Not the tear-stained vehement thing of
the burial day
From which tasteful eyes are averted, but
grief moulded
After the years have worn the rude mass
away
To the smooth urn beneath the sculptured
cypress,
Demanding no more from the passer-by
Than the tag from the classics, the
decorous sigh.
“Mrs. Lestrange turns queer at the full
moon,”
fThe whisper went, but the better sort
would douse
That flicker before it could take hold and
burn
The cherished picture, the tall, narrow
house —
Old-fashioned, yes, but still so elegant
You would never guess that the owner
had gone away
And the place was haunted. Only if,
passing by
In the street all white with moonlight,
you should glance
Up at the attic window, dark and high,
And see the face of a dead girl look out;
Only then would you know what was
hidden behind the wall
And listen behind you for the house to
fall.
Mrs. Lestrange moved over the bleached
sand.
Under the full moon to the roaring sea —
Oh, the wild, glittering, tossing surf,
spray-misted!
Heavy with salt the wind; funereally
Streamed her crape, dank as seaweed, as
she passed
Into the water, stately as though the loud
Long rollers were church pews, hushed
and devout.
A little while she showed above the white.
Black as a lighthouse tower, its lamp
burned out.
But lessened as waves climbed, dark
hollows deepened.
Till there was only bare beach and
brilliant foam
And the house was fallen and the ghosts
gone home.

In a Shaft of Sunlight.
In the sunlight among the rocks
Mica gleams and the thin red fox
c .Snaps and snarls and shows his teeth.
Stands erect with a hunter’s faith;
And the magpies stall and dive.
Bird must build and fox must live.
Ah, but see death. Ripple of ice
In sunlight. Where dead timber lies
Beneath the overhanging bough
The black snake is moving now.
His passing makes no noise.
Look; look now ! Death’s striking poise.
A river of wind flows through the trees,
Down the spine to shake the knees;
Shakes the gumnuts to the earth
To give the future forests birth
Where magpie, fox and shake
May hunt and die and men may quake.

DAVID CAMPBELL.
Topsy-turvy Land .
Rex Whistler’s Oho! (Bodley Head) is
about as crazy a book as one would ever
care to come across.
To begin with, it consists chiefly of
reproductions of Rex Whistler’s freak
drawings of heads and faces which,
looked at upside-down, make other
heads and faces. Mr. Whistler draws,
for instance, a caricature of an old man
with a beard and a wrinkled forehead;
turn the book, or yourself, or Mr.
Whistler upside-down and the beard-be-
comes hair, the wrinkles lips, and you
are looking at a caricature of a smiling
young man with wavy locks.
Similarly, Mr. Whistler draws a police-
man and, when you turn the book the
other way round, the copper has become
a sailor. A gay young chauffeur becomes
a sour old schoolmaster ; a whiskered old
nobleman becomes the Lady Cardigan
Fitzßaddley.
To make the confusion still more con-
fusing Laurence Whistler writes two little
poems on the page opposite each of Rex
Whistler’s drawings, one printed right
way up and the other upside-down-
light verses commenting on the drawings.
And then, to make the confusion
utterly confounding, the publishers have
presented the book with identical and
reversible covers, title-pages and end-
pages, so that it doesn’t make the slightest
difference whether you read the book
front to back or back to front, right way
up or upside-down. The present re-
viewer, not being accustomed to this sort
of thing, read it standing on his head,
with his feet. And has only one com-
plaint to make; that it’s a pity, when the
whole thing is so lighthearted, that Rex
Whistler lampooned humanity with
faces so brutally conceived and piggish.
Farnol at a Glance.
It is said, usually by disgruntled
authors, that some critics review a book
without reading more than the blurb: a
disgraceful allegation and sometimes,
possibly, true. The present reviewer pro-
poses to do something even more dis-
graceful with Jeffery Farnol’s Heritage
Perilous (Sampson Low; Robertson and
Mullens) and review it by simply look-
ing at the illustration on the dust jacket.
And that, it may be, will give a fair
enough notion of the book after all. For
this is Mr. Farnol’s 35th novel, and,
judging by the jacket, it is not likely to
differ very much from the previous 34.
A white bell-topper lies in the fore-
ground. It has been knocked off in a
death-grapple. Forgetful of his hat for
the moment, as well he might be, a tall,
dark, angry, hawk-nosed gentleman with
sidewhiskers, in a cutaway coat and rid-
ing breeches and boots, stands glaring at
a simple, square-jawed sailor who has
him by the throat.
On the ground, six feet away from the
belltopper, lies an elderly rustic of poor
but honest appearance, obviously knocked
down by the gentleman with the side-
whiskers. And, shrinking on the other
side of the illustration, timorous but en-
chanted, a young female of respectable
but dishevelled appearance watches the
combat. ,
Dark-haired and violet-eyed, the girl is
clutching her dress to her shoulder, from
which it has been rudely torn. And if
Mr. Famol has been running true to
form, the wicked-looking person in the
sidewhiskers has been attempting to
seduce this poor, trusting little thing and.
when her father has rushed to the rescue,
he has knocked the poor old man to the
ground. Virtue is saved, of course, by
the timely arrival of the simple, square-
jawed sailor, undoubtedly the maiden's
lover.
The only trouble about this forecast ot
the story is that the sailor looks alto-
gether too humble a person to marry the
violet-eyed maiden, who is obviously the
long-lost Lady Violet Wedderbum. But
that is all right. A glance at the blurb
confirms one’s suspicion, that Sam is, in
reality, the long-lost Earl of Wrybourne.
The blurb also says that the story is
set two years after the death of Nelson
and that Mr. Farnol—as is undoubtedly
the case —has lost none of his old magic.
It does not say, however, whether the
villain is named Sir Devilish Hawke or
Sir Jasper Murgatroyd.

mean more than MOULDINGS
THE term “Plastics” to most people suggests moulded articles, but these are only
one of the multitudinous uses to which Plastics can be put.
Broadly speaking, commercial plastics comprise upwards of a dozen different
chemical types.' Many of these are prepared in* a large variety of formulations and
forms.
Whilst most people can distinguish moulded plastics on sight, other forms escape
nptice, because they are combined with, or masked by, other materials. Plastics are, for
instance, largely used in “finishes” by the paint industry, in plywood manufacture, in
bonding gear wheels and abrasive wheels, in some kinds of paper and textiles.
Although comparatively expensive, a small quantity of plastics frequently secures
results out of all proportion to cost—results unobtainable by other means.
Plastics include some of the most lasting materials known to science. They are
non-corrosive and resist extremes of climate and most other forms of physical and
chemical attack.

Information Sought.
Australian shearing records for (1) hand
shears and (2) machine shears?
(1) The record for blade shears stands to the
credit of Jack Howe. In 1892 at Alice Downs,
Blackall, he shore 321 sheep in seven hours 40
minutes. (2) There are numerous claimants,
but variation in length of day’s work and
class of sheep shorn -render determination of
supremacy difficult. In 1893 Jim Power shore
315 sheep at Barenya (Q.) in seven hours 20
minutes. In 1909 Dan Cooper shore 316 in a
full eight-hour day at Bundooran (Q.). In
1946 M. Fisher shore 315 ewes and lambs in
seven hours 45 minutes at Bunda (Q.). Many
higher tallies have been claimed in New
Zealand in crossbreds. J. Hope shore 378
sheep in eight hours 54 minutes. The only
basis on which records should be recognised
should be for the full eight-hour day in grown
sheep and separate classes should be recog-
nised for Merinos and crossbreds.

Method of catching estuary perch ?
During warm weather rod and line are mostly
used. The bait varies according to the season.
Moths, crickets and grasshoppers form a very
attractive bait and are eagerly seized, the hook
being suspended near the surface. During the
flder months the hook is allowed to drop close
the bottom, the most successful bait in this
case being prawns, worms and the larvae of
wood-boring beetles. A fish bait or an arti-
ficial fly is sometimes used.

I have a concrete fishpond in Sydney the
water of which is rather muddy. How can the
water be cleared without harming the fish ?
Run a gentle stream of water through the
pond with a hose. This should clear it in a day
or so, but if it should become muddy again
clean everything out and plant it with aquatic
plants, such as Anacharis or Vallisneria, in well-
washed Nepean sand.

How to make a small quantity of office paste
that will keep?
Place one cup of water in a small saucepan
over fire, and add one teaspoon powdered alum.
Put one tablespoon flour or starch in a cup,
blend smooth with cold water, then pour into
saucepan when it boils, stirring well until the
mixture thickens. Let boil for a few minutes,
then whisk in one teaspoon oil of cloves as
preservative. Beat well, and pour into wide-
mouthed jars. A larger allowance of flour will
make a stiffer, lardlike paste.

★
Rn urgent and
important message
If you own War Savings Certificates
which are about to mature, don’t cash
them—hold on to them and they will
continue to pay you better than bank
interest.
If you lodged your War Savings Certifi-
cates with your bank for safe keeping,
with instructions to redeem them at
maturity, you should immediately cancel
that instruction and request your bank
to retain your Certificates. In that way
they will continue to increase in value
—at better than bank rates of interest.
If you lodged your War Savings Certifi-
cates with your bank and gave no
instruction about redemption at matur-
ity, you need take no action at dll. So
long as they remain with your bank,
they will continue to increase in value
each year.
If you are holding your Certificates
yourself, you should lodge them for a
further five years with your bank or
savings bank, which will hold them in
safe custody for you completely free of
charge.
Savings Certificates are now issued in a
new five-year series for face value, in
denominations of £l, £5, £lO and £5O,
which in five years’ time will be worth
£l/3/-, £5/15/-, £ll/10/-, and £57/10/-
respectively.
These generous interest rates will also
apply to War Savings Certificates, matur-
ing this year- —if you don’t cash them.
Every pound’s worth, for which you paid
16/- seven years ago, will rise further in
value to £l/3/- in five years’ time by
yearly steps.
There is no better place for your savings than in Savings Certificates.
So hold on to all you own, and buy as many more as possible of the
five-year series. They are cashable at any time, and the annual increases
in value are free from taxation. Regardless of holdings of War Savings
Certificates, everyone can own £250 worth of Savings Certificates.

GARDENER’S LUCK.
Gardening is an art remote,
Requiring one to doff his coat.
And bow his head like billy-goat,
As at the window of the tote.
His vertebrae thus curved in toil.
He rakes and smites his plot of soil.
And then he spreads “Blue Runners Royal,
Providing strings where they might coil.
The seeds explode at later date,
And shoots appear: “How are you, mate ?
We thank you for your kindness great,
But for support prefer your gate.”

LOUIS, COLORED HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF
THE WORLD, AND TONY GALENTO, JUNE 19,
1939, AMERICA.
Though staggered by Louis
By a right on the chin
He wagered fierce battle
With hope to win.
The formidable black
Dealt slashing blows
And made the blood ooze
From Galento’s nose.
But he battled heroic
With a savage frown
And twice in the fight
Had Louis down.
But the champion won
By his force and skill
And did frankly admit
He was no easy mill.
FORMS OF DAILY SERVICE FOR USE IN
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.
Let Us Peay:— I
0 Lord, grant that this day we come to no

Neither run into any kind of responsibility.
But that all our doings may be ordered to

New and quite unwarranted departments
For ever and ever.
Hymn :
O Thou who seest all things below
Grant that Thy servants may go slow,
That they may study to comply
With regulations till they die.
Teach us, we pray, to reverence
Committees more than commonsense,
Impress our minds to maae /v > plan
But pass the baby when wo fean.
And when the tempter seems to give
Us feelings of initiative.
Or when alone we go top far,
Chastise us with a circular.
’Mid war and tumult, fire and storms,
Strengthen us, we pray, with forms.
Thus will Thy servants ever be
A flock of perfect sheep for Thee.

THE BUSHRANGERS
No. 12 of "The Cookabundy Chronicles”
BY BRIAN JAMES
DARKIE Grey followed the dim
track through the box saplings
and ancient heaps of mullock. Its
gloom seemed appropriate to his
own blighted life.
Fourteen, lean, but well set-up, black
of hair and hard of face, and with the
large calloused hands of a grown man,
Darkie was just beginning his career as
a professional bushranger. “I ain’t going
back!” muttered Darkie to himself, “I’m
damned if I’ll go back!”
As a matter of fact, he had been driven
by society into the dark ways of crime ;
there was some mournful satisfaction in
that. Society was represented by his
father —armed with a stock-whip. Only
an hour ago he had been burr-cutting
on the flat among the ring-barked timber
when his father cantered up. There had
been “words” about “dawdling and loaf-
ing,” and a general summing up by his
father —“You’re a lazy, useless animal!”
That was no way to speak to a man ;
and then and there he had “cheeked”
his father. And
his father men-
aced him with
the whip, and
threatened t o
“cut the tail off
h i m.” There
had ensued a
disgraceful
scene, dodging
in and out
among dead
trees and fallen
logs, and one
chop across the “tail” that might have
been a lot worse if he hadn’t been wear-
ing the thick corduroys ; and then the
hurling of a lump of quartz that nearly hit
his father, and would have, too, hadn’t ex-
citement spoiled his aim a bit. Then
flight into the scrub, where his father
couldn’t pursue him with any chance of
success.
From the fringes of the scrub his father
had bellowed such threats of indignities
to come as put his home out of bounds
for ever. In any case, he had always, he
thought, hated his father ; and his mother
and the rest of them would have to put
up with it, now that he had been driven
to this. “But I’m damned if Til go back! ”
ON the far side of the ridge Darkie
came to Lost Lead Gully, a tribu-
tary of Noonan’s, and he headed along
the track in the direction of the distant
Hump.
At the second fence he came upon
Joey McMahon. Joey of all people in
this hour of the great need of consola-
tion! If only Joey would —if only Joey
might! For he and Joey had long been
sworn brothers in villainy and in bright
plans of complete outlawry. Joey looked
very cheerful.
“Hullo, Joey!”
“Well, Darkie! And are you clearing
out again?”
Darkie, full of rage and hopelessness,
was close to tears. He hoped his voice
didn’t quaver. “Too right, Joey. And I
ain’t going back this time. Not on your
life! I nearly killed the old man, caught
him with a gibber. Bet he’s feeling pretty
sore.”
Joey made allowance for pardonable
exaggeration, and knew well enough that
Darkie expected him to. He said “Good
on you, Darkie! Good on you! Serves
him right, and it has been coming to him
a long time. How did it happen?”
Darkie told him. A burning account
in which courage and manliness on the
one side stood firm against injustice and
brutality on the other.
“And where are you going to,
Darkie?”
Darkie’s courage was. returning. “Me?
I’m going to the bush. Bushranging,
Joey! And I’m damned if I’ll go back
any more.”
Joey was a handsome youth, and a
very limb of Satan, which handsome
youths often are. He was the same age
as Darkie, a few months younger perhaps,'
but taller and more neatly built. He had
curly brown hair, and a very clear face,
and very blue eyes, and a lovely voice
that made his biggest lies more convinc-
ing than the truth itself.
“I’m clearing out, too, Darkie.”
Darkie knew this wasn’t true, but he
believed it in spite of himself.
“Are you, Joey?”
“You bet!”
“Row?”
“Told the old man to go to hell. Well
make for the Hump, I reckon. There were
hundreds of bushrangers there one time.”
Strictly speaking there had been only
one bushranger at the Hump. And he
wasn’t so much of a bushranger either,
and he lasted only a week, and he had
labored under the frightful disability of
the name of Dirty Dan. That, as much
as anything, and the absence of spectacu-
lar crimes had given him quite a light
sentence when the troopers arrested him.
“They’ll never take us there, Joey.
Alive, I mean.”
“That’s the way* Darkie! ” Joey looked
approvingly at Darkie. But blast it all,
too, Joey was leader already!
“Now, Darkie, there are a few things
well be wanting. Revolvers for raids,
and some good shotguns to defend the
pass.”
“We haven’t any.”
“Soon get ’em, Darkie.”
“We’d better take a bit of tucker, too.”
Darkie had much of the practical in him,
and in any case he was hungry just now,
the row with his father having occurred
just on dinnertime,
“Well live off the bush,” said Joey.
“Fivecomers, geebungs, yams. We can
always get a fat steer when we want
one.”
THEY were following the track and
planning as they walked. Now they
came to the old side road that ran from
the main road to the few farms beyond
the Lost Lead Gully. The side road led
first to Shane’s place. Not much of a
farm now, if it ever was. Only “ould”
Granny Shane left there, and her son
Bartley who was simple. She was Joey’s
grandmother.
“We won’t call in there, will we,
Joey?”
“And for why, Darkie, wouldn’t we
now?” Unconsciously Joey was falling
into something of the brogue and the
idiom at the very sight of “ould” Granny’s
home. “And would it be the fair and
the decent thing to be embarking on bush-
ranging, no less, and never a word or a
blessing from ‘ould’ Granny, before we
start?”
“But—you—won’t tell her, will you?
“Never a word. But a happy memory
she’ll be having, and she seeing the very
last of us before we become the curse of
the whole countryside.”
Darkie didn’t like it at all, and said so.
Joey said “You leave it all to me, Darkie,
and the total management of it.”
“But she doesn’t know me, and what
are you going to tell her about me?”
“All that will come into the plans and
the mystery of it.”
They didn’t approach from the front,
but made a wide detour ..through the
scrub and came upon the house from
the rear, as it were, as though they were
really travelling from the Hump instead
of to it. That was Joey’s notion, and
Darkie conceded the brilliance of such
tactics. As they came through the back
sliprails a cattle dog roused himself from
beneath a kurrajong and rushed savagely
towards them as fast as his three legs
would carry him,
“Well, if it isn’t you, Soldier, you old
sinner!” said Joey, and Soldier immedi-
ately said it was all a mistake anyhow,
and he didn’t know it was Joey at first;
and he made various friendly noises in
his throat. Soldier was an institution all
to himself, and there was no dog in the
whole world quite like him.
> Ofginally blue perhaps, he was a dirty
sort of washed-out color,now, and ragged
and scarred all over. There were only
three legs, a front leg having been taken
in the last round or two of an oat crop
years ago when they were using the mow-
ing machine, and Soldier was chasing a
hare, and neither of them fully cognisant
of the deadliness pf this new-fangled
machine. There was only the one good
eye, the other a wall and very white at
that. There was only one ear, mostly
cocked up in a one-sided alertness; the
other disappeared in a fight long ago.
The top lip on the side had been shorn
off very neatly also long ago when
Soldier had come in the way of Bartley’s
axe —Soldier thinking, maybe, there was a
snake or lizard in the log. The loss of
the lip gave Soldier a very sinister look
on that side, and a perpetual snarl.
' But despite all his age he was a battler
still, and was damned if he’d give him-
self up entirely to a career of fleas and
flies. Now Soldier went in front to the
house to announce friendly visitors, woof-
ing greatly and waving his tail. He had
a complete tail,
“That’s a dog if you like!” said Joey
with no little pride, which indicated,
too, a respect and affection for Granny.
“He’s the sort of dog we well might have
to watch for the troopers, and we sleep-
ing after some hold-up.”
“Ould” Granny Shane
was seated on the
verandah, with her queer
old chair placed on the
part of it where
the boards were
not so broken.
Mostly an active
woman, she was
now dozing and
nodding in that
drowsy, sticky
heat that means a thunderstorm later in
the day ; as did the high white clouds that
were massing above the Cookabundy
Ranges.
There was something like an antir
macassar over Granny’s face —to keep out
the light and the flies, too, most likely.
There was a swaying to and fro, slight
and rhythmical, for the legs of the
chair had been set on staves from a
cask, an idea of Bartley’s entirely—-bless
his heart —and proving he was not so
silly at all.
“Quid” Granny left her rockers and
antimacassar and came round the side
of the house, and Soldier, having done
all that duty and hospitality required,
went back to his kurrajong.
“\\J ELL, if it isn’t you, Joey, now!”
VV Granny was very pleased and
kissed Joey. “And who would be this
fine boy, Joey?”
Joey’s brogue thickened considerably,
and his idiom set more firmly. “You
would be remembering the Maloneys,
Granny?”
Granny did —the Sugarloaf Maloneys,
the Maloneys from Yellow Waterhole,
the Ten Mile Maloneys, the Kilmarnock
Maloneys, the Two Rocks Maloneys, the
Mount Pleasant Maloneys—and numer-
ous other Maloneys. “And sure, wouldn’t
I remember, they being all related to me
or connected?”
“And this isn’t one of them at all.
Granny, and not a bit related to any of
our Maloneys, neither. This is a new
family, entirely, that have taken over
that place of Roper’s beyond the old
Riverside Sawmill.”
“Och,” said Granny, “and how would
I be knowing them, then?”
f ‘A grand family, too!”
“And I am glad to be hearing of it.”
With these satisfactory credentials
Darkie was duly welcomed. But by now
he was reduced almost to speechlessness
and confusion in trying to remember he
was not himself but one of the new
Maloneys. In a broad aside Joey in-
formed Granny “He’s bashful, maybe,
at first, and you call him Dame, which
is but the shortness for Michael Terence.”
Joey had calculated that “Maloney” was
a big enough load for Darkie, and a
further burden would spoil everything.
Granny took them into the dining-
room —the biggest room in the whole
house—to give them something to eat and
to get the news. She was a bright little
old woman —“Nothing to her at all,” as
people often said. A mere wisp, but
tough and springy in the fibre for all
that. Very straight, too, though there
was a suspicion of a hump behind her
shoulders. Just a little hard of the hear-
ing and a little short in the sight, which
made her peer through her steel-rimmed
glasses—very bent and battered glasses
from her sitting on them so often when
she had them in her pocket. The pocket
was nearly a yard deep.
But with all her grey thin hair and
wrinkled face and sharp nose, there was
something youthful still about Granny—
it may have been her quick movements or
more likely her keen interest in all that
went on. There was something beauti-
ful still in her face, a vague suggestion,
an elusive memory, of beauty once, like
fleeting sunshine on a showery day,
A learned woman she was, too, with a
store of information about banshees and
fairies and leprechauns and more know-
ledge of St. Patrick and Malachi and
Brian Boru than any history book could
ever give you. And she had, among
other things, read nearly all Shakspeare,
and “Father Oswald,” and three pages of
Rabelais when she piously burnt the book
—“And me not knowing at all it was like
that.”
She had had fifteen children, counting
Bartley and the three that died, and it
was no little pride with her that never a
one of the six girls had married “out of
her church nor her turn.” And she was
proud of Himself, and no one more
attentive to his “duties,” while he was
alive that was, and him taking the pledge
three times a year as regular as clock-
work ...
Joey got all this for the fiftieth time
at least, and Darkie for the first time.
Darkie couldn’t follow it too well, even
had his mind been functioning properly.
But he was glad of the slabs of cake
that Granny cut from “me last pound
cake,” which was about as big as a
tombstone, and a lot thicker.
Joey kept up a variety of pious and
soothing chatter, and made a dovetailing
of fact and fiction that was worthy of
the best cause in the world. And it was
necessary —to prevent that cross-examina-
tion of Darkie that he knew Granny was
itching to make. That Darkie was “shy”
and “bashful” was not sufficient, so an
affectionate auntie, recently deceased,
and a “second mother if ever there was
one” was invented for Darkie, ahd a
great grief and a sorrow were firmly
fastened upon him.
So Joey answered for him, always ask-
ing Darkie to confirm the answers:
“Now, that would be so, wouldn’t it,
Darkie?”
And Darkie, deep advanced in the
territories of idiocy, would mumble and
nod blankly. He was no longer aware
of who he was supposed to be, of what
his people were beyond a dim under-
standing that he was a great Catholic and
he had an older brother studying for the
priesthood.
None of the textbooks on bushranging
had even hinted at such difficult situa-
tions as this. He longed to be gone and
be a man again, and he tried to forget
that he was a Methodist, and strictly
brought up at that, and that his father-
blast him! —was a lay preacher. Still, his
terror —and the “great grief and sorrow”
didn’t prevent his devouring cake, for
he had been ravenously hungry.
BARTLEY came in from the long
paddock. His simplicity took the
form of a cheerful excitement. Whatever
Bartley saw or heard it sent him into
ecstatic interest with no known varia-
tions to it.
It rather spoilt him, for he was a nice-
looking man. He must have been forty.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.S. WORLD POLICY.
Naturally, President Truman’s import-
ant policy speech to Congress on March
12 has since been the world-affairs topic
most widely discussed both in America
and other countries.
In America its effect was to force a
showdown on the lately-elected Republi-
can-dominated Congress. There has been
a great deal of talk in support of inter-
nationalism by Republican leaders in
U.N.O. arid elsewhere. President Tru-
man’s speech demanded action in place
of words. The plain choice it gave was
between positive U.S; action in world
affairs or a proclaimed lapse into isola-
tionism. The isolationist Chicago
“Tribune,” of course, declared that the
outcome of adopting the President’s pro-
gramme “will inevitably be war,”
One definitely inevitable result would
be dollar cost. This is awkward to
Republicans intent on national expendi-
ture reductions and consequent solid tax
cuts. Action supportihg the much-pro-
fessed abandonment of isolationism is
even more awkward on other grounds.
A fine analysis of the chief implica-
tions of the speech has been made in a
London “Times” leader. Declaring that
the speech “is leading men and nations
in every continent to contemplate a
fundamental readjustment in interna-
tional relations and to re-examine the
foundations of world security,” the
“Times” points out that it raises the
question of “whether the United Nations
is enough.” American withdrawal from
U.N.O. is not suggested, but “new and
direct channels for the exercise of Ameri-
can influence may now be shaped,”
That influence is already being exer-
cised elsewhere in Europe where “war
and destruction.... sucked from so many
areas their former independence and
strength”; Mr. Truman’s speech now
extends “the prospect of American sup-
port to a new area, the Eastern Medi-
terranean and the Middle East”:
It is an area where America has hitherto
been reluctant to intervene with authority,
no doubt because it is, next to Germany,
the most critical area of the world today.
Here the great Powers observe each other
over open flanks; and the lesser States,
like a row of skittles, .threaten to topple
down one after the other when once the
first is struck. A poise so precarious needs
underpinning; and what Mr. Truman pro-
poses is to substitute in Greece an American
for a British prop, and to create an even
firmer prop for Turkey than she has
hitherto enjoyed. Were this not done, he
said, “confusion and disorder might well
spread throughout the entire Middle East.”
'This is true; but it may prove equally true
that American support and interest must
spread as far. In particular the United
States will hardly now be able to avoid
formulating a positive policy for expression
when the Palestine question comes before
the United Nations.
If, says the “Times,” America is “con-
cerned to maintain in the world at large
that way of life which President Truman
described, which is the British way of
life as well, then she must choose be-
tween exercising power herself and
criticising its exercise by others in a
different manner.” There is currently
being published in America every day an
enormous amount of such criticism of
Russia, as in other days British “imperial-
ism” was a favored target. The more
recent persistent criticism of Britain
over Palestine has sharply declined since
fed-up Britain embarrassed all parties,
including American Jewry, politicians
and press, by putting that thorny prob-
lem up to U.N.O. Action involves
responsibility.
Analysing President Truman’s speech
on its most vital implications, the
“Times” asks what, when all is said and
done, is revolutionary in it, and con-
tends :
Not the promise of economic help for
foreign nations; that, it may be thank-
fully acknowledged, is familiar. Not the
prospect of the political engagement of the
United States in a distant continent ; that
radical departure has already been taken.
Nothing subsequent to it could be as revo-
lutionary as the American offer, the accept-
ance of which Mr. Marshall has described
as his main objective in Moscow, to par-
ticipate in a four-Power pact of guarantee
against German ( rearmament. Even engage-
ment in a new area of critical strategic im-
portance can scarcely be called revolutionary
when America is so deeply involved already
in Central Europe. Yet for all that a revo-
lutionary element in the speech can be dis-
tinguished. It lies in the blunt readiness it
expresses to go ahead with a controversial
—Manchester (Eng.) “Daily Dispatch.”
UNDER THE COUNTER.
American policy, without preliminary great
Power agreement or discussion by the
United Nations. It is in this sense that the
question is raised whether the United
Nations is enough.
Another implication of the speech
pointed out by the “Times” is that it
questions “the basic doctrine of great
Power harmony”; the hitherto held
assumption that the great Powers could
agree on, and jointly apply, “the
measures required in areas of critical
contact.” The “harmonious equilibrium
of power” concept (Washingtonese for
the old “balance of power”) involved in
Mr. Truman’s proposals is in the “Times”
view “a concept that may well be fruit-
ful at this moment.” In this respect,
Mr. Truman’s initiative, by defining the
area of American interest, far from in-
creasing the tension of international politics,
may in the end prove to have opened up
an opportunity. It may even make agree-
ment more easy, for the Russians at least
prefer talking in real terms. Certainly
there can, be no stable basis for world
peace while the foundations of national
life in the Middle East are insecure, and
while that insecurity invites the develop-
ment of rivalry among the greater Powers.
In America at this writing the debate
was still raging. Republican leaders
have given signs of being considerably
discomfited, as shown in questions touch-
ing on war possibilities of the policy.
which they declared would have to be
satisfactorily answered before the policy
would be endorsed. So that there could
be no subsequent claim that they had
been misled, Acting-Secretary of State
Acheson bluntly told the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on March 20 that the
proposed aid to Greece would “con-
sist of supplies for the Greek army.”
Though the issue is decidedly a knife-
edge affair, the Republican leaders,
unless they have a Communistlike facility
at somersaulting, would seem to be too
deeply committed to professed inter-
nationalism not to move forward at least
in the direction, if not on the exact lines,
suggested by the President.
ATOM BOMB JUSTIFIED.
In B. 5/3/’47 “Uncabled Additions”
gave extensive information on the atom
bombing of Japan, an issue of much con-
troversy, especially in America, ever since
the bombs were dropped. That informa-
tion included references to a most im-
portant article by former U.S. Secretary
of War Henry L. Stimson in “Harper’s
Magazine,from which quotations had
appeared in the British press, but which
itself had not then reached Australia.
The Stimson article is a long, care-
ful account of the U.S. secret policy
moves leading up to the decision to use
the bombs, concluding with the follow-
ing general summing-up in which Mr.
Stimson justifies the use of the bombs
and gives further interesting items of fresh
information: —■
With President Truman’s warm support I
struck off the list of suggested targets the city
of Kyoto. Although it was a target of consider-
able military importance, it had been the
ancient capital of Japan and was a shrine
of Japanese art and culture. We determined
that it should be spared. I approved four other
targets including the cities of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.
Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and
Nagasaki on August 9. These two cities were
active working parts of the Japanese war effort.
One was an army centre; the other was naval
and industrial. Hiroshima was the headquarters
of the Japanese Army defending southern Japan
and was a major military storage and assembly
point. Nagasaki was a major seaport and it
contained several large industrial plants of
great war-time importance. We believed that
our attacks had struck cities which must cer-
tainly be important to the Japanese military
leaders both Army and Navy, and we waited
for a result. We waited one day.
Many accounts have been written about the
Japanese surrender. After a prolonged Japanese
Cabinet session in which the deadlock was
broken by the Emperor himself, the offer to
surrender was made on August 10. It was based
on the Potsdam terms, with a reservation con-
cerning the sovereignty of the Emperor. While
u 6 reply made no promises other than
those already given, it implicitly recognised the
Emperor’s position by prescribing that his power
must be subject to the orders of the Allied
Supreme Commander. These terms were
accepted on August 14 by the Japanese, and the
instrument of surrender was formally signed on
September 2, in Tokyo Bay. Our great objec-
tive was thus achieved, and all the evidence
have seen indicates that the controlling facto
m the final Japanese decision to accept ou
terms of surrender was the atomic bomb.
The two atomic bombs which we had droppec
were the only ones we had ready, and our rate
°f P r °duction at the time was very small. Hat
the war continued until the projected invasion
on November 1, additional fire raids of B-29’
would have been more destructive of life anc
property than the very limited number of atomic
raids which we could have executed in the same
period. But the atomic bomb was more than
a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psy
chological weapon. In March, 1945, our Ai
Force had launched its first great incendiary
raid on the Tokyo area. In this raid more
damage was done and more casualties were in-
flicted than was the case at Hiroshima. Hun-
dreds of bombers took part and hundreds ol:
tons of incendiaries were dropped. Similar suc-
cessive raids burned out a great part of the urban
area of Japan, but the Japanese fought on
On August 6 one B-29 dropped a single atomic
bomb on Hiroshima. Three days later a second
bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and the war
was over. So far as the Japanese could know,
our ability to execute atomic attacks, if neces-
sary by many planes at a time, was unlimited.
As Dr. Karl Compton has said, “It was not one
atomic bomb, or two, which brought surrender;
it was the experience of what an atomic bomb
will actually do to a community, plus the dread
of many more, that was effective.”
The bomb thus served exactly the purpose
we intended. The peace party was able to take
the path of surrender, and the whole weight of
the Emperor’s prestige was exerted in favor of
peace. When the Emperor ordered surrender,
and the small but dangerous group of fanatics
who opposed him were brought under control,
Japanese became so subdued that the great
undertaking of occupation and disarmament was
completed with unprecedented ease.
1 have tried to give an accurate account of
my own personal observations of the circum-
stances which led up to the use of the atomic
bomb and the reasons which underlay our use
°f it- To me they have always seemed com-
pelling and clear, and I cannot see how any
person vested with such responsibilities as mine
could have taken any other course or given any
other advice to his chiefs.
• Tw °c ® reat nations were approaching contact
in a fight to a finish which would begin on
November 1, 1945. Our enemy, Japan, com-
manded forces of somewhat over 5,000,000
armed men. Men of these armies had already
inflicted upon us, in our breakthrough of the
outer perimeter of their defences, over 300,000
battle casualties. Enemy armies still unbeaten
had the strength to cost us a million more.
As long as the Japanese Government refused to
surrender, we should be forced to take and
hold the ground, and smash the Japanese ground
armie's, by close-in fighting of the same desperate
and costly kind that we had faced in the Pacific
islands for nearly four years.
In the light of the formidable problem which
thus confronted us, I felt that every possible
step should be taken to compel a surrender of
the homelands, and a withdrawal of all Japanese
troops from the Asiatic mainland and from
other positions, before we had commenced an
invasion. We held two cards to assist us in
such an effort. One was the traditional venera-
tion in which the Japanese Emperor was held
by his subjects and the power which was thus
vested in him over his loyal troops. It was
for this reason that I suggested in my memo-
randum of July 2 that his dynasty should be
continued. The second card was the use of the
atomic bomb in the manner best calculated to
persuade that Emperor and the counsellors
about him to submit to our demand for what
was essentially unconditional surrender, placing
his immense power over his people and his
troops subject to our orders.
.. order to end the war in the shortest pos-
sible time and to avoid the enormous losses of
human life which otherwise confronted us, I
felt that we must use the Emperor as our
instrument to command and compel his people
to cease fighting and subject themselves to our
authority through him, and that to accomplish
this we must give him and his controlling ad-
visers a compelling reason to accede to our de-
mands. This reason furthermore must be of
such a nature that his people could understand
his decision. The bomb seemed to me to fur-
nish a unique instrument for that purpose.
.My chief purpose was to end the war in
victory with the least possible cost in the lives
of the men in the armies which I had helped to
raise. In the light of the alternatives which, on
a fair estimate, were open to us I believe that
no man, in our position and subject to our re-
sponsibilities, holding in his hands a weapon of
such possibilities for accomplishing this pur-
pose and saving those lives, could have failed to
use it and afterwards looked his countrymen in
the face.
As I read over what I have written, I am
aware that much of it, in this year of peace,

may have a harsh and unfeeling sound. !
would perhaps be possible to say the sa
things and say them more gently. But I a
not' think it would be wise. As I lo °*
over the five years of my service as Secretary or
War, I see too many stern and heartrending
decisions to be willing to pretend that war i
anything else than what it is. The face of war
is the face of death; death is an inevitable
part of every order that a war-time leader gives.
The decision to use the atomic bomb was a de-
cision that brought death to oyer a hundred
thousand Japanese. No explanation can change
that fact and I do not wish to gloss it over.
But this deliberate, premeditated destruction was
dur least abhorrent choice. The destruction ot
Hiroshima and Nagasaki put an end to tne
Japanese war. It stopped the fire raids, and the
strangling blockade; it ended the ghastly spectre
of a clash of great land armies.
In this last great action of the Second World
War we were given final proof that war is death.
War in the twentieth century has grown steadily
more barbarous, more destructive, more debased
in all its aspects. Now, with the release or
atomic energy, man’s ability to destroy himseir
is very nearly complete. The bombs dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended a war.
They also made it wholly clear that we must
never have another war. This is the lesson men
and leaders everywhere must learn, and I be-
lieve that when they learn it they will find a
way to lasting peace. There is no other choice.
ARMY EDUCATION.
While Canberra dithers about Aus-
tralia’s defence forces having to wait on
U.N.O. developments, Britain has not
only gone ahead and set up the complete
future establishment of its forces but in
the course of doing so has adopted a fine
innovation which Australia could well
copy in taking Britain’s defence lead.
In presenting the Army Estimates on
March 13. Mr. Bellenger told the House
of Commons that henceforth, as well as
special education for illiterate recruits,
there will be a system of civil education
all through the Army:
Two hours’ compulsory training a week
in general subjects would be given to every
man in the primary training centre, where
the period would be about six weeks. Every
man would receive four hours a week of
compulsory education during his corps
training period of about 10 weeks. Later
he would receive five hours a week com-
pulsory education training when he joined
the unit. At least one hour of that com-
pulsory training would be in citizenship and
current affairs.
This training of Tommy Atkins —in-
cluding technical training designed to
equip him to go back into civil life at
the end of his service far better able to
get a well-paid job—is to be given by
the Royal Army Education Corps. Mr.
Bellenger described the training as “some-
thing no peace-time soldier had had
before.”
EXPANSIONIST ENOUGH.
When U.S. Under Secretary of State
Acheson was reported to have described
Soviet Russia as “aggressive and expan-
sionist” it brought a Soviet Note of pro-
test, in which Molotov described the
statement as a “gross slander.”
Nobody in U.S. took much notice of
the Note (apart from General Marshall
having implicitly supported Acheson),
though, for what the difference might
amount to, Acheson’s actual words were
subsequently given a§ “expanding and
aggressive.”
By any other name the figure smells
as sweet —an expansion of Soviet boun-
daries since the beginning of the late war
by over 260,200 square miles, embrac-
ing 21,937,684 non-Soviet citizens.
That is actual grab, not mere control
by domination. Going into the details
place bjr place and listing Finland,
Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Czechoslovakia, Rumania, Tanna Tuva,
Kuriles, Sakhalin and Port Arthur and
Darien, the N.Y. “Times” Washington
correspondent points out that this record
of the Soviet grabbing “does not take
into account Soviet tactics at present in
Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Iran, Bul-
garia, Rumania or Greece ; nor does it
relate to Soviet occupation policies in
Germany or Korea ; nor does it refer to
the Soviet diplomatic demands for the
Turkish areas of Kars and Ardahan ; the
Soviet attempts to get Tripolitania and
Eritrea ; or the Soviet demands for bases
in the Dardanelles or on Spitsbergen. It
refers merely to expansion, past tense.”
Or, as the same paper commented edi-
torially, Acheson’s phrase “was not
slander, unless a statement of fact is
slander. It was a description of some-
thing that has happened.”
Some of the Soviet expansion has
been sanctioned by the U.S., but
that does not apply to the Baltic
countries Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia,
which seem to have gone more definitely
to the Soviet for keeps than perhaps some
of the other grabbings. “The U.S., stick-
ing to its policy of opposing aggression,”
a N.Y. “Daily News” correspondent
points out, “has gone right on recognis-
ing the three Baltic State Legations in
Washington as representatives of their
Governments, even though their
countries no longer exist in fact.”
According to this N.Y. “Daily News”
correspondent, when Lithuanian repre-
sentatives called on President Truman
just before the last Congress elections
they were assured that the U.S. “has not
forgotten the Baltic States,” that U.S.
policy towards them “has not changed
and will not change.” Also as a pre-
election item it was stated by the chair-
man of the Republican party that that
— N.Y. "Journal American.”
SMALL FRY.
party “would work toward the restora-
tion of the Baltic States’ stolen
sovereignty.” The interesting point is
made by William Henry Chamberlin in
“Wall-street Journal” that actually “Mos-
cow was ahead of Washington in recog-
nising the independence of Latvia, Lithu-
ania and Estonia,” so “the picture of the
Western Allies ‘tearing’ Russia’s western
territories away from it,” after World
War I, “is fantastically misleading.”
The “Daily News” man calls the ques-
tion of whether U.S. is going to do any-
thing about the restoration of those
States’ independence “one of the toughest
jobs facing General Marshall.” Still, the
correspondent does not give them much
hope, nor does anyone else.
ANTI-SEMITISM.
A curious feature of Palestine agita-
tion is the emphasis put by Jewish leaders
in America on widespread anti-Semitism
in Europe.
Dr. Brickner, of the United Jewish Ap-
peal, has stated: “Poland is not too bad
on the surface because there are compara-
lively few Jews left there. But in other
places, especially in Czechoslovakia, there
is a rising tide of anti-Semitism that is
frightening.”
Further, “it seems to me that Hitler
won the war. There is a distressing spread
of chauvinism, with each country intent
on cofnplete nationalism. There is no
room for anyone else, in their way of
thinking. It is for this reason that Jews
want to go to Palestine. They have
learned by bitter experience that no one
else wants them.”
Dr, Brickner also said that the
500,000 Jews in Rumania and Austria
“have a daily fear of the ‘iron curtain’
falling and preventing them from ever
leaving.”
Regarding Austria, Ira A. Hirschmann,
back in U.S. from a top position with
U.N.R.R.A., quoted “a high Army
official” in Europe as having told him he
“wouldn’t give a plugged nickel for the
life of a Jew when the American forces
are withdrawn.”
Nobody seems to ask why all this
should be so.
DRAGNET DIGEST.
Equality in Moscow. —Some time back a
N.Y. “Times” Moscow correspondent returned
to America because the Soviet censorship made
his job impossible. His successor, Drew
Middleton, manages to get along by the simple
device of frequent resort to irony; tor ex-
ample: “There isn't any racial discrimination
in Moscow, and the sexes are equal. This
morning, women were out chipping ice off the
streets just like the men.’’
* * * *
"Grassroots” Opinion in U.S. —An “opinion
poll” with a good deal more to it than the
usual lightweight variety was taken in America
when “the outstanding editors in 1000 rural
counties the so-called grassroots of the
U.S. population” were asked what they would
like Congress to do about various current
problems. The editors, with a total audience
of some 70,000,000, weighed in with a 92 per
cent, vote in favor of trade unions being re-
quired to “accept more responsibility than at
present.” In the same section there was “an
82 per cent, vote to compel unions to publish
financial statements —to tell the public where
they get their money and what they do with it.”
A 95 per cent, vote favored elimination of war-
time boards and bureaus; 84 per cent, favored
a “radical slash in the number of Federal job-
holders.” The vote on “Should Congress en-
courage a tougher policy with Russia?” was:
Yes, 54 per cent.; No, 23 per cent.; no
answer, 21 per cent. Voting on Congressional
support for U.N.0.: Yes, 89 per cent.; No,
3 per cent.; no answer, 8 per cent. Voting on
a firmer policy towards Communists and fifth-
column activity: Yes, 85 per cent.; No, 9 per
cent.; no answer, 6 per cent.

Big Red Cross Figures. —The U.S. liking for
bigness should be well satisfied by American
Red Cross figures for the latest year recorded.
These show that volunteer workers reached a
peak of 7,500,000, estimated to have given over
24 million weeks of time. The number of
paid workers, 2098 in 1941, has gone up to
14,368. “A membership record of 56,550,733
was established in 1945, when 36,645,300 adults
contributed $1 or more and there were
19,905,400 junior members in schools and
colleges.” For the last recorded year contri-
butions aggregated $784,151,800. Help was
given to “more than 75,000,000 overseas war
victims, including 27,145,400 children, in 40
countries.”

looks into the polemical dialectic currency:
“ ‘Democracy’ is one of the debased coins of
the language, so thoroughly debased, in fact,
that it can be properly used only by a knave
or a fool. The knave uses it with intent to
deceive, the fool because he has been de-
ceived.”

Jap Super-warships— The Japs, according to
a “Life” correspondent, actually constructed
those secret super-warships about which there
was a good deal of guesswork. Two of them
were completed, each displacing 72,809 tons
when fully loaded for combat, “or some
20,000 more than the Missouri, largest U.S.
battleship.” Also, “Each carried 18.1-inch
guns which could fire armor-piercing shells
weighing 32201 b., half as much again as shells
from the Missouri’s 16-inch guns.” Both the
Jap supers were sunk “before scoring a single
hit upon any Allied ship or coastline.”

U.S. Co-operatives— The spreading co-op.
business broke records in U.S. last year, a total
of over $1,000,000,000, some 20 per cent, above
the previous year’s record. “Christian Science
Monitor” reports that one of the largest
growths was in housing, including the organis-
ing of “more than 100 veterans’ (ex-service)
co-operative housing associations.”
Dean Inge Views Spain— Even among those
who, some of them almost certainly with tongue
in cheek, supported the U.N.O. “needling” of
Franco it’s now openly agreed that the only
effect was to strengthen Franco’s position, for
the obvious reason stated by Dean Inge in a
London “Fortnightly” article: “If there is any
country which must be left to settle its own
affairs, it is Spain, that land of proud iftdivi-
dualists.” The Dean added: “As for the
‘Spanish Republic’, well documented books
have been published describing the hideous
cruelties of the Spanish Reds, who murdered at
the lowest computation 200,000 innocent per-
sons, many of them with revolting tortures.
If this evidence is not enough, there are the
confessions of poor Krivitsky, Marshal Stalin’s
agent in Spain, who knew that his repentance
would probably cost him his life. He was
murdered in America by Soviet emissaries. 1
hold no brief for Franco, nor for political
Catholicism, but throughout the Spanish civil
war the public was deliberately misled by
mendacious propaganda, which cost the lives
if many misguided young Englishmen.” There
were ignoramuses enough even in Australia
who egged them on.

A Lesser "Workers' Paradise." —Under the
new law approved this year in Czechoslovakia
the Government, says N.Y. “World Telegram,’’’
“can assign workers to jobs and punish them if
their performance is not satisfactory. Concen-
tration camps are provided for habitual lag-
gards. The camps were requested by the
Czechoslovakian Confederation of Trade
Unions, Communist-dominated, on the theory
that a man who will not do the work assigned
to him is sabotaging the work of others. Once
assigned to a job, a man can’t leave it without
permission of the Government’s employment
bureau. Wage increases? They present no
problem. The Czech unions have adopted the
principle that increases will not be requested
except where there has been an increase in pro-
ductivity or a reduction in the costs of produc-
tion.”

Jap’s GI Scholarship Legacy. —“ Private John-
stone, who was killed by a Japanese on Luzon
in 1945,” says the “Christian Science Monitor,”
“carried $lO,OOO Government insurance. But he
carried more than that. E(e carried with him
into battle a vision of a world where under-
standing between nations would make war im-
possible. So he asked that his insurance should
be used to set up a scholarship for a Japanese
student to study in America after the war.”
The ones Pte. Johnstone asked were his parents,
and, though their son was killed, they have duly
set up the scholarship, which goes to a former
Kamikaze pilot who has said that he “natu-
rally wanted to kill as many Americans as
possible during the war.”
» * * *
No Early Push-button War. —General Eisen-
hower, for one, is no believer in any early war
having scientists sitting in concrete dugouts de-
ciding the issue. “If you talk of push-button
warfare,” he has said, “you are talking about
something in the future, something that is X
years away. The application of new weapons
to actual warfare is a long distance in the
future. We are not now in anything like a
super-blitz.” He holds that any war reasonably
near ahead “will pick up just about where the
last one left off.” Hence, in his view, the need
for keeping U.S. armed forces up to sound
strength. “The American occupation forces in
Germany and Japan,” he declared, “have been
reduced to such a level that we have reached
the point of danger.”

PEACE COMES TO INDONESIA.
“Formal Dutch recognition of the Indonesian 'republic’ was followed by a request from the Premier, Sjahrir, to the Communist-controlled Waterside Workers
for continuation of its ‘black’ ban on Dutch shipping in Australian ports. In complete contempt of the ‘Government,’ Roach, the assistant general secretary, said q
would be granted."

WAR—AND "PEACE."
Eight years after Waterloo there was
civil war in Spain and, from the same
motives that were to urge on the Ger-
mans in 1936, the French intervened,
though in their case with overwhelming
forces. A cry for another French war
went up in\ Britain and there were move-
ments of troops, pointed by a Canning
allusion to “the well-known heights of
Lisbon.” But the nation was sick of
war, especially war in the crusading form,
and the Government had to let events
take their course. They proved unfavor-
able to the French, failing to consolidate
the power of the restored Bourbon
dynasty, which had ordered the invasion ;
not at all unfavorable to Britain.
The sentiments of the average English-
man of the period were pithily ex-
pressed, in a letter, by Sydney Smith, as
wise as he was witty:
For God’s sake, do not drag me into
another war! I am worn down and worn
out with crusading and defending Europe
and protecting mankind; I must think a
little of myself. I am sorry for the
Spaniards; 1 am sorry for the Greeks; I
deplore the fate of the Jews; the people
of the Sandwich Islands are groaning under
the most • detestable tyranny; Bagdad is
oppressed; Tibet is not comfortable. Am
1 to fight for all these people?
The world is bursting with sin and
sorrow. Am I to be champion of the
Decalogue and to be eternally raising fleets
and armies to make all men good and
happy? We have just done saving
Europe, and I am afraid the consequence
will be that we shall cut each other’s
throats. No war, no eloquence;, but
apathy, selfishness, commonsense, arithme-
tic May the vengeance of Heaven
overtake all the Legitimates of yerona
[the Emperors of Russia and Austria and
the Kings of Prussia and France], but in
the present state of rent and taxes they must
be left to the vengeance of Heaven. I
allow fighting in such a cause to be a
luxury; but the business of a prudent,
sensible man is to guard against luxury.
There followed 30 years of peace, dur-
ing which the painful process of recovery
was completed and immense progress
was made in every field, in the home-
land and throughout the empire. Then
a war party arose again, and this time
it had its way, few voices being raised
against it. One was that of another
wise man —John Bright:
We are undertaking to repress and to
curb Russia How are the interests of
England involved in the question? This is, ,
after all, the great matter which we, the
representatives of England, have to con-
sider. It is not a question of sympathy
with any other State. 1 have sympathy
with Turkey; I have sympathy with the
serfs of Russia; I have sympathy with the
people of Hungary, whose envoy Lord
Palmerston refused to see; I have sympathy
with the Italians and with the three mil-
lions of slaves in the United States. But
it is not on a question of sympathy that
I dare involve this country or any country
in a war which must cost an incalculable
amount of blood and treasure. It is not
my duty to make this country the knight-
errant of the human race.
Twenty-four years afterwards the man
who had been right—and had been
punished for being right—could say, as
he did, that the Crimean War had cost
the lives of a million men, “now for-
gotten, except by their mothers,” and
that all the blood and treasure had been
squandered in vain, since Russia, the
“victors” acquiescing, had repudiated
every article of the peace treaty.
Between the Crimean War and the
Russo-Turkish War of 1878 it was urged
in the House of Commons that Britain
should fight Russia (and that meant fight-
ing Austria and Prussia, also) to secure
the independence of the Poles. This
particular crusade was proposed by a
Mr. Hennessy, M.P., but Mr. Hennessy,
M.P., found few supporters and none in
the House of Commons. Nor in other
years was there any movement of public
opinion for a war with Prussia and
Austria to preserve Schleswig-Holstein
for Denmark.
But the crusading spirit revived in the
mid-nineteen-thirties, and there were no
Brights or Sydney Smiths to arrest it.
There were men who held the same views,
but their influence was inconsiderable ; in-
deed, they were denounced as “Fascists.”
A New Journalism had arisen in Britain,
the Dominions and the United States,
and it appealed to a new and ill-informed
generation, The main theme Of its young
men, conveyed in signed articles and
columns, which were held to express the
Policy of the Paper even when different
opinions were expressed in the anony-
mous editorial column, was that Britain,
which had never recovered from the
effects of the 1914-18 war and the conse-
quent depression, should go crusading
immediately and everywhere.
War for the gentle Abyssinians, the
charming Spanish Communists and
Anarchists, the noble Czechs, the
romantic Poles, the delightful Albanians
and the worthy and undivided Chinese
was presented as a pressing Imperial
duty and obligation. The French were
pictured as hot for the crusade —at least,
in Europe. It was asserted, that the
“sacred union” of 1914 and 1918 had
been restored —the 1917 mutinies were
never mentioned and the pre- and post-
Munich industrial turmoil was equally
consigned to oblivion; the universal
sentiment of all Frenchmen, irrespective
of party, was summed up in the phrase
“We’ll settle accounts with the Boche
this time,” Radio announcers were just
as active in the cause, and there were
no more ardent crusaders than Sydney
writing boys. And from America came
unceasing printed and spoken declara-
tions that if Chamberlaip didrPt fight he
would go down to the remotest posterity
as a dotard and a coward.
These young lions of journalism and
the radio, British, Americans, Australians
and the rest, got their war. Had they
got it when they wanted it, the war
would have been lost. A 1937 inter-
vention in Spain by “H.M.S. Unriskables”
would have stopped supplies from South
America and rendered it politically im-
possible for President Roosevelt to bring
his nation in, as he eventually did. And
armed championship of the dear old
Czechs in 1938 would have been attended
with military disasters as bad as, or worse
than, those of 1940. Thanks to the
statesmanship of Neville Chamberlain
and his consideration for the unready and
reluctant Dominions, the war was delayed
until Britain was ready ; ready with Spit-
fires and Hurricanes and radar; with,
an invincible navy and a brave and
admirably-led army—though insufficient
in numbers and equipment jvhen the
French collapsed—to put up a fight
worthy of its fame. And that it did, the
greatest in its history and in all history,
and successful after six terrible years.
To the writing and spouting boys the
war was to have been, on our side, a
short and “sensational” punitive expedi-
tion, with the Russians coming in from
the first and finishing off the enemy in
jig-time with their irresistible Red Army
and girl “guerrillas,” all dead shots and
ravishingly beautiful. It never dawned
on any of these simpletons, some of
whom in Australia are asserting the
moral law by publishing starting-price
supplements, that the consequences of
victory might be almost as bad as the
consequences of defeat. Yet for most
of the winners, as well as.all the losers,
the continuing results have been frightful;
and not the least frightful for Britain.
On the hard road to victory John Bull
had to sacrifice all his overseas invest-
ments and go heavily into debt to all
his Dominions and associates in the
Empire, as well, of course, to the United
States. For post-war loans he has had
to draw on the U.S.A. and Canada and
his Chancellor of the Exchequer has con-
fessed that the nation is “living on tick,”
which is being rapidly exhausted. Since
the Germans laid down their arms,
Britain, being a Christian nation, has had
to support them with a large part of
the proceeds of its terrific taxes and with
huge food cargoes, which it needs itself.
And not gratitude but hatred has been its
portion, from enemies and from “friends”
—Russians, Yugoslavs, Albanians, Jews,
and Communists everywhere. During
the second peace winter blizzards and
floods have imposed new tests on the
fortitude of a people which would in any
case have been condemned to a meagre
and monotonous diet and a shortage of
fuel. No people has ever been more
highly tried. And all the English-speak-
ing peoples are having to contend with
a Russian-Communist conspiracy which
they will have to overcome lest it over-
come them.
Australia, for its part, out of
consideration for its own situation
ns well as that of Britain, has
had to resume trade with Japan, and
now with Germany. Because of the
terms of the American loan to Britain, it
is threatened with the loss of its British
preferences, if not of its whole tariff
against foreign countries. With Britain
giving up India, Burma, Egypt, the
Sudan and possibly Ceylon and Hong
Kong, and with Indonesia whirling itself
into a new and doubtful arrangement
with the Dutch, Australia has entered
upon a new age, inconceivable to the
writing and spouting boys of 1935-39.
Yet Australia’s duty is plain. It is to
support Britain all along the line—with,
in the first place, gifts of food to the
limit of safety; with a reduction of sterl-
ing balances and with steady partnership
with the British Government and the
Governments of the other Dominions at
all international conferences. There is
no longer any excuse for assumption of
“leadership of the small nations,” nor can
cavilling at the socialist measures of the
British Government be erected into a
policy. Australia should take its stand
beside Mr. Attlee and Mr. Bevin, and do
what it can to hold up their hands so
that they and their partners may save the
British Commonwealth.
"On the Way Out."
Throughout Australia political “Labor”
is feeling the draught. The electors have
awakened at last to the bluff of Mr.
Chifley’s “Golden Age,” to the failure of
the post-war reconstruction programme
(still a mere blueprint) and to the devas-
tation of industry under endless strikes,
preventible but never prevented, nor even
punished.
They provided “Labor” with ample
political equipment. The Chifley Gov-
ernment was returned to office, with con-
trol of the Senate, at the first post-war
election, and there were “ ‘Labor’ Gov-
ernments” in five of the six States. Com-
monwealth “Labor” was furnished with
unlimited power, this under extended
national-service regulations, as well as ex-
isting statutory authority under the Ar-
bitration and Defence Acts, for carrying
out the peaceful restoration of our in-
dustrial economy. And all the six
“ ‘Labor’ Governments” had and have
been offered every assistance by Opposi-
tion parties for maintaining of the law
against unreasonable strikes fomented
by Communists and bogus “moderates.”
“Labor” has completely failed. With
every political advantage to their hands,
its Ministers have demonstrated—not for
the first time—that they cannot govern.
All pretence that discontent in the unions
is the fruit of oppressive management by
capitalist bosses is utterly exploded in
the key unions—now without exception
under Government control through ex-
tension of war-time powers. The strikes
which are sabotaging the reversion to a
peace-time regime are plainly seen to be
aimed at the extraction of sectional ad-
vantages and the enhancement of unions’
status to the detriment of the community
and of a sovereign Parliament. The in-
ability or reluctance of “ ‘Labor’ Govern-
ments” to uphold the law or even their
own authority against defiance by these
freebooters is delivering the Common-
wealth over to anarchy.
There can be no peace anywhere in
eastern Australia while the present
“Labor” Governments remain in office.
That is the plain lesson w)iich the past
two years have impressed on the electors.
The A-L.P. realises the fact, and its
spokesmen on every side are registering
the party’s panic. South Australia has
confirmed its previous anti-“ Labor” ver-
dict ; Westralia has rejected the party
which ran it for most of the period be-
tween the wars and for all the period of
the war against the Axis and since, and
three eastern States are preparing to fol-
low suit, “Labor” reactions to the rising
popular resentment are unmistakable.
The “Labor” party will find itself on the
way out unless it deals firmly with the
menace of Communism. Today a man
will leave his job during a strike, not
caring how many others are thrown out,
and take another job in a factory not
affected by the dispute.— Mr. Rosevear, the
Speaker at Canberra.
The industrial disputes are causing the
Federal Government very great concern.
I don’t think we have seen the worst yet.
—Minister Dedman.
“Labor” lost 32 seats in 1932. You
have got to win country seats, and you
have got to stop industrial unrest in the
cities if you are going to win country
seats. — N.S.W. Minister O’Sullivan.
In no circumstances can the Govern-
ment tolerate the action of Communist-
led unions in extending the metal-trades
dispute.— Premier Cain (Victoria).
We must impose discipline.— N.S.W.
Minister Cahill.
These are current samples of the outcry
from “Labor” Ministers in eastern Aus-
tralia, provoked not so much by a state
of affairs before which they have hitherto
remained complacently impotent, but by
the awareness that their wastrel chickens
are coming home to roost.
These Ministers’ plea is that they can
do nothing. They have been content to
pass the buck to each other. Their stereo-
typed retort to protests against the supine-
ness of their executive authority with
every new strike is “It’s a Federal
matter,” or “It’s a State matter,” which-
ever the appropriate phrase; “It’s a
matter for the Stevedoring Commission”
was Federal Minister McKenna’s addi-
tion during the latest wicked wharf strike.
This sort of cowardice would be bad
enough if they merely held the balance
between disputing employers and em-
ployees. But when their “Governments ’
have themselves “taken over” industries
and services the plea of helplessness is
ludicrous and shameful.
Besides, the excuse is baseless, because
these “ ‘Labor’ Governments” have abdi-
cated what authority they possessed. They
might indeed have trouble within their
own ranks if they belatedly attempted to
use the powers long resident in statutory
and common law. Because they have
always been afraid to use those powers
they are less able to muster the courage
now. To adjure individual union mem-
bers subjected to vile forms of intimi-
dation to cure unaided the insurgence of
their leaders and mobs is as idle as to ex-
pect individual citizens to invoke legal
processes which Governments have
ignored. And at the coming elections in
Queensland, N, S, Wales, Victoria and—
perhaps in the Commonwealth, too, as a
consequence of rout in the States —it will
be useless for “Labor” to appeal for con-
fidence on assurance that it will put the
Communists in their place and eliminate
strikes. The electors have “had” that
sort of bunkum.
Mr. Truman has shown the way to
curb the arrogance of insurgent unions
and strike-leaders who declare war on
the community. With hot so much direct
control over U.S. coalmines as the Com-
monwealth “Government” has assumed
over shipping and the waterfront, he
ordered Lewis, the boss of the coalminers'
organisation, to call off a strike and his
miners to resume. When they refused the
President moved the law by taking out
an injunction restraining them from con-
tinuance of unlawful acts. When that
was defied he took them to a Federal
Court, where they were heavily fined.
Straightway Lewis became a pricked bal-
loon. His surrender at every point, one
being the proclaimed abandonment of
another strike heralded to begin on
April 1, procured an alleviation of the
fine imposed on his union, but not of his
own.
The effects of this successful invocation
of Federal law have not only been nation-
wide but international. In the process
Mr. Truman has added cubits to his Presi-
dential stature. Has the example he has
given no instruction for our Common-
wealth “Labor” Ministers? It has left
them as feeble in purpose and action as
before.
Said Minister Dedman at an A.L.P.
panic meeting in Sydney:
If you could find some way of dealing
with these strikes the Government would
be very pleased. We are limited in action
by the Constitution.
The same old alibi! And Premier Cain
trotted it out again. He accused the Liberal
leader, Mr. Hollway, of not making any
practical suggestions to end the strikes,
upon which Mr. Hollway retorted that he
had constantly suggested, and would urge
again, that the Victorian Govern-
ment should (1) introduce the secret
ballot as mandatory before a strike is de-
clared, and (2) prosecute industrial law-
breakers, and particularly those who in-
cite others to break the law.
Of course qll these Governments have
powers. The overwhelming responsibility
lies with Canberra, since the Chifley
Ministry has extended the life of its
national-service regulations; but even
without them, and leaving aside the
Crimes Act—mere mention of which
every “Labor” Minister regards as sui-
cidal —there are penal resources in the
Arbitration Act, emasculated as it was by
the Scullin Government in 1930, which
Mr. Chifley and Dr. Evatt have not
attempted to use. Section 56D, for ex-
ample :
The Court may order, at any stage of
proceedings in relation to a dispute, that
any matter upon which the Court thinks
fit to ascertain the views of members of
an organisation which is a party to a dis-
pute be submitted to a vote by secret
ballot in accordance with directions given.
Section 58B(A) forbids any officer or
servant of an organisation during the
currency of an award from advising, en-
couraging or inciting any member from
accepting employment or offering for
work —penalty, £2O. Section 78 provides
that any organisation or person bound
by an industrial agreement shall for any
breach or non-observance of its terms be
liable to a fine not exceeding £5OO on the
organisation, £250 on an employer and
£lO on an employee.
The Scullin Government knocked out
other penal clauses making any union
leader who by violence, threats, intimida-
tion or abusive language, or by declaring
persons or goods “black,” prevented any
person from accepting or offering for
work liable to a fine of £lOOO. It also
wrenched from the statute, as amended
after the 1926 wharf strike, clauses re-
quiring strict audit of union accounts,
the same to be reported regularly to the
Registrar. But even accepting the statute
as it is, with its disciplinary structure gap-
ing a half-empty jaw of teeth, the Cabinet
to which the bleating Dedman belongs
has never attempted to test whether the
disciplinary powers remaining are suffi-
cient. What would it do with the addi-
tional powers which, in excuse for inac-
tion, it complains of lacking? In all
matters in which Mr. Scullin is interested
it leans heavily on that gentleman for ad-
vice. And the Scullin Administration, of
which Mr. Chifley was a member in its
last phase, would not even retain the
powers the Latham amendment gave.
“We are limited in action by the Con-
stitution.” A mean and miserable excuse
for total and ignominious surrender.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Unswung Heroes.
“Ex-Gunner”: I was interested to read
the statement of the Sydney Watersiders
president, Coghlan, Coughlan, Coogan
or something, to the effect that if it hadn t
been for the wharfies’ efforts durihg the
war many ex-servicemen would never
have returned.
Till the leader of Coughlan’s Com-
mandos made his revelation propaganda
had blinded me to the great war work
of the wharfies. When I was in the
islands and we were howling out for
equipment and stores which everyone
knew were in ample supply in Australia,
we were told that the delay was due to
slow turn-round of ships through go-
slow policy on the wharves. This, I now
realise, was just sheer propaganda —the
stuff was loaded quickly enough, but the
boats went cruising round the Pacific on
pleasure jaunts. When our canteen goods
arrived, “ratted,” we used to be told
that wharfies had been knocking them
off. More propaganda; obviously the
seagulls had got at ’em on the way up.
In June, 1945, with an island sideshow
in progress, our guns were placed on a
restricted ammunition rate of 10 rounds
per gun per day. This kept infantry
activity down to patrol work only and
prolonged the campaign in a particu-
larly unhealthy area. At the time we
blamed the wharfies for that, too, but
apparently we were wrong.
Three years before that some of our
regiment, returning from the Middle East,
were kept back from home leave to un-
load ammunition at an Australian port.
The story told then was that the wharfies
had refused to handle the stuff unless
they received danger money. Obviously
another horrible libel.
Looking back now I can’t see how we
believed any of those stories because at
one stage of the war we put in three
months on the Sydney wharves ourselves.
We had come down from New Guinea
with a rather high malaria rate and were
given the wharf work as a kind of rest
cure. Of course we didn’t have to do
it for the miserable rates of pay the
wharfies slave for; we got our full Army
pay.
When I finally came south for dis-
charge it didn’t occur to me that I owed
my return to the wharfies. The troopship
was held up for three days at Towns-
ville —the authorities said there was a
wharf strike, but that was probably a
lie—and three weeks at Brisbane —she
was “black” by them, we were told, but
I suppose if the truth were known the
owners wanted her to stay in Brisbane
for a while. Still, on that occasion per-
haps we did have the wharfies to thank,
because we were sent down from Bris-
bane by train and everyone knows that
trains can go faster than ships, so we
got home a little earlier than we would
otherwise have done. Perhaps that’s the
sort of thing Coogan, Coughlan, Cogh-
lan or Coggin had in mind when he re-
minded us how much we owed the
wharfies.
How much do we owe them? It is
plain from N.S.W. Premier McGirr’s ex-
cuses for these worthies during their re-
cent 14-day strike and his denunciations
of their critics that he, at least, thinks
no end of them.
A Smashing "Labor" Defeat.
According to a Queensland People’s
party man, a 4 per cent, swing would
oust the Hanlon “Government,” and
there was one of 5.8 per cent, in Wes-
tralia. It was more than that in each of
the contested electorates, Albany ex-
cepted ; a great deal more in many. And
30 were contested. The “ ‘Labor’ Gov-
ernment,” now only a memory, won six
and was indebted to the returning
officer’s casting vote for a seventh —Pil-
bara; where there is certain to be an
appeal. In five of its 23 electorates there
are not more than 7000 adults. There are
more than twice as many in Nedlands,
Canning and Mt. Hawthorn and nearly
twice as many in Middle Swan, each won
by a Liberal.
Mt. Hawthorn was ex-Minister Milling-
ton’s electorate. In 1943 Mr. Millington
had a two-to-one majority, 7113 to
3549. His successor in the “Labor”
nomination was defeated by 287. Lost
to “Labor” also were ex-Premier Will-
cock’s constituency of Geraldton and the
other port electorate of Bunbury, each a
party stronghold for 30 years. In Can-
ning (15,357 electors) an absolute
“Labor” majority of 24 in 1943, which
might have been increased to 2000 had all
the votes been counted, was converted
into a minority of 1578. Liberal majori-
ties were up 700 in North Perth, 500 in
Subiaco, 1000 in Nedlands (though here
the “Labor” man was “unendorsed”),
1400 in Claremont, 1000 in Nelson and
1100 in Greenough.* C.P, majorities were
also up everywhere. As for the “Labor”
members whose majorities faded or
vanished, even Deputy Premier Hawke,
Premier Mitchell’s conqueror in 1933, saw
his surplus votes diminish from 1611
three years ago—2B2B to 1217—t0 480.
And Forrest, “Labor” throughout its his-
tory, was held by a beggarly 68 votes.
In point of fact, Westralian “Labor,”
which swept the Federal polls in 1943
and nearly did it again in 1946, when
only “Russia Is Always Right” Mount-
joy was left on the beach till that C.S.I.R.
job was ready for him, hasn’t had such a
doing since the conscription year 1917.
With everything in its favor, boundaries,
rolls and unopposed returns (15), except
the party’s State and Federal record, it
lost six seats (and that is giving it Pil-
bara), and two more or less friendly In-
dependents shared in the disaster. The
causes of its defeat and that of its part-
ner in South Australia are continent-wide,
and so will the rot be. Nothing can stop
it if the Opposition parties in other States
work together, as has been and is being
done in Westralia, and if a Liberal-
organisation man in Sydney and another

Allies of Communism.
Sydney “Sun” suddenly found itself in
accord with Mr. Rosevear the other day
and urged all good unionists to pay close
attention to what it called Mr. Rosevear’s
“attack” on Communists’ “new strike
technique”:
By this callously selfish process a worker
leaves one job declared “black” and ob-
tains another, not caring in the least
that hundreds of other workers may be
deprived of their living. In Mr. Rose-
year’s deliberate words, the man who
takes such an action is “as big a ‘scab’ as
the man who wants to work in a work-
shop that has been declared ‘black.’ ”
All very true, of course, but Mr. Rose-
vear’s discovery is belated.
Matching the target for the Speaker’s
scorn and that of an A.W.U. official is
a selfish and greedy type of employer.
No striker would be able to “leave one
job declared ‘black’ and obtain another”
unless there was somebody ready to give
him the other job. That there are em-
ployers only too willing to do so is evi-
dent. The Victorian metal-trades “dis-
pute” fairly reeks with such evidence, and
so do the histories of the dockworkers’
and 1.C.1. strikes in Sydney.
In the 1.C.1. affair, a body-snatching
row between unions resulted in the
Communists “pulling out” key men and
laying one of the country’s vital chemical
plants idle. Apart from other things,
this will result in additional losses of
hundreds of thousands of sheep, whose
owners relied upon 1.C.1. production of
drugs like carbon-tetrachloride and
phenothiazine to stand off the onset of
millions of sheep parasites. The strike
is months old ; the plant is still picketed
by unionists who get £7 a week from
their union for doing it; no drugs are
being made and the country is desperately
short of chemicals. Yet so - called
key men, as well as many of those whom
1.C.1. had to stand down, have jobs else-
where and are contributing to the pay-
ment of the pickets. Those who em-
ploy them also contribute, indirectly.
Another example turned up in Queens-
land, where the secretary of the Moulders’
Union got at apprentices at an engineer-
ing works and told them they’d be called
“scabs” if they did “laborers’ work” like
lighting ovens and sweeping floors. The
boys refused the work. The employer,
with permission of the Minister, stood
down the apprentices. A day or so later
he learned that the union secretary had
got them jobs in a shipyard as painters
and scrapers at almost thrice their pay
as apprentices.
There is no excuse for this sort of
thing. Employers may plead shortage of
labor and a hundred other reasons; but
so long as they find jobs for strikers from
other employment, so long do they make
the way easier for industrial anarchy and
the Communist conspiracy. The same
is true of the kind of employer wh©
assists the Communist conspiracy by
trading with it.
Moscow's Malignity.
That the insignificant Communist puppet-
State of Albania should deliberately use
weapons of war against Britain and defy
the United Nations Charter need no
longer be a matter for astonishment. The
Russian veto on the Security Council’s
decision in favor of Britain is the clear-
est indication of Moscow’s approval, if
not close abetting, of a calculated injury
to a Great Power, a leader in inter-
national efforts to establish world peace.
When the Albanians fired on British
warships in the Corfu Channel, an inter-
national waterway, and then mined it,
with the result that two British destroyers
were damaged and 44 British seamen
killed, the so-called Albanian Govern-
ment relied upon British pledges under
the U.N.O. Charter to escape the punish-
rrient which would unfailingly have been
visited upon them in “the bad old days.”
The new order requires the in-
jured party, great or small, to
submit any such hostile act to
judgment of the Security Council,
the operating arm of that international
law which exists so far only in the hopes
of idealists. The Soviet having once
again misused a privilege in order to
paralyse that arm, Britain’s further resort
can (according to the book of the words)
only be to the International Court of
Justice. It will be instructive to see
whether Moscow thumbs its nose at that
body also. By then the world at large
should be in a fair position to estimate
whether U.N.O. is anything but the
buffoon-ballet to which the Communist
Empire seems intent upon reducing it.
The acid test was bound to come, and
the Albanian case should serve well
enough for its application. The Soviet’s
sponsoring of these brigands’ insolence —
it would be flattering them to term
theirs a hostile act —is in no way dis-
guised. Its appointed nark at the United
Nations’ table, Gromyko, had the effron-
tery to suggest there that the British Navy
itself laid the Corfu mines. And at the
Foreign Ministers’ conference in Moscow
Molotov matched this gesture of con-
tempt by proposing that Albania, which
did no discoverable fighting except on
the Italian side, should be invited to the
Powers’ discussions on Germany, while
suggesting that the door should be
banged and barred against Canada, Aus-
tralia, South Africa and New Zealand.
Does it really do any service to world
peace to belong to this sort of club?

Bookmakers.
Though, with allowance made for the
difference in population, backing horses
is not such a craze in New Zealand as it
is in Australia, its incidence and its bear-
ing on racing prompted the Government
to set up a Royal Commission on
Gaming.
In N.Z. there is a swarm of illicit
bookmakers who pay “tote odds” with
self-set limits, and pocket the equivalent
of the 1 1-i per cent, tax whose proceeds
are divided by the Government and the
clubs. Some of these worthies may have
indulged the hope that the proceedings
would provide a case for the registration
of their fraternity. If so, they must have
been disillusioned when the evidence got
fairly under way.
The N.Z. Racing Conference came
armed with a host of anti-bookmaker
facts and figures, beginning with a sho r t
and pithy history:
Parliament decided in 1920, for reasons
it thought good and proper, that book-
making was a parasitical and anti-social
mode of earning a living. These reasons
still hold good in 1947. Bookmakers have
always been, and always will be, a corrupt,
or at least undesirable, influence on racing.
And there was a general reference to
“big punters,” held up for admiration
and emulation in Sydney prints:
Big punters are persons reputed by rea-
son of extraordinary skill or luck to be
able to beat down and break through the
almost impregnable defences of the book-
maker and thus win large sums —always
said to be over four figures, and sometimes
over five —from these unhappy people.
Big punters in New Zealand always have
the same end. After a time they vanish,
but their money has always gone before.
Surprise evidence was given by the
president of the N.Z. Jockeys’ Associa-
tion, who said his association was
“strongly opposed to the licensing of
bookmakers, on or off the course.”
It would bring about unpleasant things
for us and we would be asked to do
things we should not do. It would also
mean a return of big betting.
A report on betting in Australia, the
work of a Sydney solicitor, John Hickey,
was presented by counsel for the N.Z.
Racing Conference. Referring to the
position in N. S. Wales, the report stressed
the vogue of illegal betting in industrial
suburbs “where there is an illegal book-
maker to almost every street,” and the
“large proportion” done by telephone;
“the better-established betting houses have
silent lines.” For the spread of off-the-
course betting newspaper publicity
and broadcasting were blamed; if rac-
ing broadcasts were prohibited—as is the
case in Britain, except for half a dozen or
so races in the course of a year—“bet-
ting would be grea’tly reduced, but there
is little hope of this prohibition.” Too
true —while “Labor” is in.
In New Zealand bookmakers can be
and have been sent to jail without the
option, though juries generally let them
off. If the law is tightened up as a result
of the Gaming Commission’s report there
may be an exodus of these fellows to Aus-
tralia, particularly N. S. Wales. In
Sydney they would find themselves in a
bookmakers’ paradise.
They would be able to bet on almost
anything, football;, sailing and cricket
included. Betting has become an un-
savory element of Rugby League foot-
ball, even on Sundays, Sunday football
being permitted by the “Labor” Govern-
ment in pursuance of its ambition to
make the community “enlightened and
self-reliant.” Bookmakers gorging in the
sight of people eating modest lunches,
and others calling the odds on almost
every detail of the game, were members’-
stand features of the Test matches played
in Sydney; and bookmakers seem to be
able to hire the Cricket Ground for
private matches whenever they want it —
not the No. 2 oval, either, but the one
on which international cricket is played.
And such of them as have social ambi-
tions can count on being glorified in one
or other of the papers. Each of the
morning journals has recently presented
a favorite bookmaker (war record un-
stated) as the glass of fashion and, in
one case, as the mould of form.
But the Taxation Department would
strongly object to any immigration of
this sort. Examination of bookmakers’
income-tax returns and betting sheets and
ledgers (if any) constitutes no small and a
most difficult part of its work. In his
report tabled on March 7 the Taxation
Commissioner gave a list of .56 N.S.W.
bookmakers, most of them registered,
who had been charged penalty tax for
“understatement” of taxable income.
The “understatements” amounted to
£121,697 ; the penalties to £11,693.
The plague of betting and other forms
of gambling in Australia cannot be dis-
sociated from the plague of “industrial
unrest.” An investigation on N.Z. lines,
with this factor added, would be useful.
But scientific or philosophic inquiries
imperilling votes are not in Australian
“Labor’s” line.

N.S.W. Premier McGirr’s head has
been in a whirl since he came out with
clumsy championship of the striking
wharfies who held up food for Britain,
among many other things. Dimly con-
scious of public reactions, he announced
last Friday that he would take his mob
to the country on May 3—the date of the
Queensland Assembly elections —and that
the rolls would be closed on Saturday, a
non-working day for his departments. No
time for purification of the rolls, which
showed up very badly in September, or
for registration of new electors, many
of whom qualify in the course of a week.
A “good-as-Labor” journalist, ignoring
the legislative record of the “Labor ’
crowd in the last Parliament—the Sydney
Turf Club, Tied-House and Parliamentary
Pensions Acts —refers to the Premier as
“big smiling Jim McGirr.” Present indi-
cations are that the electors will wipe the
smile off his face.
Lang carries too many guns for his old
friend Calwell. Scared by palpable signs
of public hostility to his preference-to-
refugees “policy,” Calwell introduced an
alien-registration measure which drew
from J.T.L. the comment that it provided
for “an internal passport system ; the first
step towards a police State.” Losing his
temper, Calwell retorted that a certain
immigrant named Swindell had come to
N. S. Wales to introduce “fruit machines”
(tin-hares, really) “in association with
the then Premier, Mr. Lang” —‘‘and the
the Governor-General,” Lang interjected.
Trying to bustle his bill through, Calwell
found Lang ready with an objection that
the committee and third-reading stages
could not be taken at the same sitting.
And, to the Jews’-harp Minister’s
chagrin, Lang was declared Right.
Dozens of bereaved families in Sydney
have had their grief intensified and pro-
longed while their dead lay unburied as
a result of an inhuman strike called by
the Undertakers’ Assistants and Cemetery
Employees in “protest” against a decision
of the Full Bench of the State Industrial
Commission. The union secretary, one
Muir, was scathingly dealt with:
Webb, J.: The community is to allow
people to die and remain unburied while
your men, who work in an industry that is
a public service in the best sense of the
word, do nothing. Is that their idea of
their duty towards the industry and their
fellow-men?
Muir: The matter was considered by the
men at their meeting.
His Honor; If this is so it displays a
callous outlook.
Muir: The men considered that they
had no alternative.
His Honor: Did you point out the pos-
sible alternative? The men are taking part
in an illegal strike.
When Muir mumbled tfiat he did not
know how another approach could be
made to the Commission, Justice Webb
described the statement as “an abject con-
fession of lack of knowledge” and told
Muir that he was “incompetent in his
position and incompetent to deal with a
matter of great importance to the health
of the community.”
These “columnists”! A “Daily Mirror”
reference to the gravediggers’ strike
turned in the ghastly word “dinki-di.”
Not to be outdone the “Sun’s” young
man burbled “If the strike goes on much
longer, they’ll have to work with a
skeleton staff.” What aeons away from
the Elizabethan dramatist!
Call for the robin redbreast and the wren,
Since o’er shady groves they hover,
And with leaves and flowers do cover
'Tie friendless bodies of unburied men.
xnis is a barbaric age in many respects.
The warning of Jobbins, chairman of
the Victorian Electricity Commission, on
the state of his enterprise, which has been
living from hand to mouth for two
years, was followed by the threat of a
strike by engineers at Yallourn. The
Cains replied by promising a royal com-
mission—the invariable “Labor” expedi-
ent if buck-passing (“It’s a Federal
matter,” “It’s a State matter”) won’t serve.
These “Labor” Governments are
obsessed with the notion that any form
of distress can be salved with cash. The
Federal crowd, urged again and again to
make Britain gifts of food, asserted that
it had done enough by knocking
£25,000,000 off the British commitment
to Australia incurred in fighting Aus-
tralia’s war. Now it has joined the Mc-
Girr electioneers in N.S.W. in offering
drought-relief amounting to £1,500,000 to
wheatgrowers who lost their crops last
season. The money will be acceptable,
heaven knows, but much more welcome
would be some relief from “controls,”
taxes and labor “laws” which hamper
land production.
McGirr was not game to let Opposition-
leader Treatt’s motion for a Royal Com-
mission on sales of State bricks to come
on in the N.S.W. Assembly. He treated
the House with contempt by announcing,
not in Parliament, but to the Press and
on the day of Parliament’s adjournment,
that an inquiry would be undertaken by
the Public Service Board,
Warrnambool (Vic.), which has just cele-
brated its 100th anniversary, is a shocking
examplb of how decentralisation is not
practised, even in a small State like Vic-
toria. The natural port for a district
prolific in the production of wool, meat,
buttfcr, potatoes, etc., it sends all its pro-
ducts overland to Melbourne, 170 miles
away, and receives its manufactured
articles by the same means. There are
three or four local factories making
woollens and other things, and the biggest
milk-processing plant in the southern
hemisphere is there; yet Warraambool’s
jetties serve no other purpose than to pro-
vide seats for fishermen.
Under the new Queensland Transport
Act, to be administered by a single
Transport Commissioner, all private
operators of road, sea and air transport
within the State will have to pay a tax
of Id. per passenger and 3d, per ton
freight per mile. The Hanlons regard
the measure as “liberalising” transport,
but it still means that a truck going to
New England from Brisbane with
Queensland produce must return empty,
and trucks carrying fat lambs from the
Downs to Brisbane must do the same.
Who pays for the empty journey? The
public.
Queensland seems to be a pioneering
State in more senses than one. The first
to cast a union boss in damages and costs
for calling workers “scabs,” it has now
fined a baker £5 for not delivering bread
to a housewife, the magistrate—a Bris-
bane stipendiary—saying housewives had
been “packhorses” too long. Sydney
housewives, even when bread is de-
livered, have to put up with stale stuff
on Mondays because of the McKeil day-
baking measure.
Not only Truman has had enough of
Communists in Government jobs. Under
an Act of the New York legislature signed
by Dewey, who may be Truman’s oppon-
ent for the Presidency, strikes of “public
employees” are “prohibited under penalty
of instant dismissal.” Penitents, if re-
employed, “will be deprived of pay-
increases for three years and of security
of tenure for five years”; and during that
probationary period if they try any
monkey tricks they will be “discharged
summarily.” New York State has just
on twice the population of Australia.
A Communist, Williams, succeeds a
Communist, Wells, as president of the
Miners’ Federation. Williams is from
Wales, via Wonthaggi (Vic.), and he may
be the last Communist to hold the office.
The way things are going, Communists
will at no distant date be outlawed from
all Government and union positions. That
will certainly be the case if Fadden and
the Commonwealth and N.S.W. Country
parties have their way.
Two N.S.W. “Labor” Ms.L.A., Sweeney
(Bulli) and Horsington (Sturt), are not
going up for re-election on May 3. By
virtue of this “sacrifice,” enforced in
the case of Horsington, who was refused
another party nomination, Sweeney may
put in for a life pension of £5 a week
and Horsington for one of £6 a week,
with a £3-a-week reversion to widows.
Lethbridge, of Corowa, who was rejected
by two lots of electors last year, thereby
qualified for £5 a week, plus reversion.
The Country party is pledged by a con-
ference decision to repeal the McKeil
measure which provides for this legalised
and unheralded robbery of taxpayers,
with its implication that Assemblymen
who have voted in three or more Parlia-
ments have thereby established a claim to
a far greater share of the country’s
bounty than war-wrecked servicemen
and widows of fighting men. That con-
ference decision alone —and there were
other good ones—should bring C.P. can-
didates a vast amount of support,
Sydney is to have a Show-time Educa-
tion Conference, held, of course, at the
Town Hall, which sheltered war-
time conferences in aid of “democracy,”
to which unsuspecting heads of “anti-
Fascist” bodies were lured to identifying
themselves with innocent-looking Com-
munist schemes. Speakers at the Sydney
effort are advised to remember to leave
at home any ideas to which Communists
might be allergic. The Town Hall is very
near the Domain.
According to' Dr. van Mook, Lieut.-
Governor-General of N.E.L, the signing
of the Linggadjati agreement providing
for the de facto recognition of the Re-
public of Java, Sumatra and Madura and
the formation of the United States of
Indonesia under the Dutch Crown opens
a new era. H’m; a new era opened in
Japan in 1870 when feudalism was
ostensibly abolished. That new era came
to a violent end in August, 1945,
If, as strike-leader Coghlan main-
tains, the N.S.W. branch of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation has the
right to ignore servicemen’s preference
in admitting new union members, on
the argument that the union is not an
employer, then the new Commission to
“control” waterfront employment ought
to have a word to say. If that also
proves a blue duck, the ex-servicemen
may have no resort but to help them-
selves by setting up their own water-
front union and applying for registra-
tion.
It was scarcely anticipated that the
McKeil appointment would lead to the
publication of a Court Circular, but
“S. M. Herald” is getting one from Can-
berra. Chifley has formed the habit of
calling at Yarralumla every Saturday
morning to report, not necessarily with
his humble duty, so we get this in the
“Herald” on a Monday;
His Excellency the Governor-General,
Mr. W. J. McKeil, received the Prime
Minister, the Right Honorable J. B. Chifley,
at Government House, Canberra, on Satur-
day morning.
Last week’s entries were mostly to the
effect that “their Excellencies gave a
dinner party,” the guests in each
case being a large body of Federal
“Labor” politicians and their wives.
During the same period of grand demo-
cratic simplicity the British Farmers’
Union was completing the deadly arith-
metic of losses in the blizzards and the
floods —“1,370,000 sheep and lambs;
30,000 store-cattle; 100,000 acres of
winter wheat; 100,000 tons of potatoes” ;
and the President of the Board of Trade
was preparing a speech in which he said
“I wish food imports could be increased,
but we haven’t the dollars to do it.” How-
ever, a bit of food for Britain was mov-
ing, very slowly, from Sydney wharves
after the McGirr-defend.J fortnight
strike.
Dismayed by the threat of a Govern-
ment transport strike in Victoria, Chifley
went cap in hand to the private road
hauliers and asked them to pull him out
of the mess in which “Labor” has landed
the State. Bullyragged in “peace,” the
hauliers are now asked to rush into the
trenches. They want to know, in effect,
whether they will be treated by “Labor”
as they were after the last Victorian strike
of Government railmen and tram-men.
Spouting in Sydney on behalf of the
McGirrs, Senator McKenna said that the
aims of the Government could be crystal-
lised in one phrase; “Compulsory
Christianity throughout the nation.” Ap-
plications for the new Torquemada will
presumably be called forthwith.
Strange are the ways of the N.S.W.
Housing Commission. A Sydney man
who “drew” a house in a ballot last De-
cember hasn’t been able to find out yet
where it is, but a couple of weeks ago
he got a bill for unpaid rent. When he
protested the Commission had the de-
cency to admit that “there must be a
mistake.” Had it been the Taxation De-
partment it would have insisted that he
pay up and protest afterwards.
There has been a series of N.S.W.
“Labor” regional-council meetings at
which sundry agitated gentlemen, Rose-
vear the Speaker, and worthies of less
note, issued warnings and prophecies in
Cassandra’s vein. O’Sullivan, the State
Transport Minister, gloomily recalled
that his party had lost 32 Assembly seats
in 1932, and allowed that a repetition of
the disaster was possible if “industrial
unrest” went on. Nobody reminded the
gentleman that his “Government,” the
biggest employer in his State or any other,
had never lifted a finger or spoken a
word to check “industrial unrest”; but
for once the listening comrades seemed
tongue-tied.
Without forewarning the electors,
Queensland “Labor” abolished preferen-
tial voting, and the change served it
fairly well at the last Assembly election.
It didn’t reckon itself quite so clever
when Barnes, called “the Bundaberg
Bombshell,” announced that he had
formed himself into a party which was
nominating a dozen candidates, eight of
whom are to oppose pledge-and-caucus
men. Since he became a figure in the
Assembly “the Bombshell” has gone out
nearly as often as he has gone off, but
on all these occasions he has never failed
to give the “Government” a headache.
From a fed-up motorist:
Doubtless appealed to by his harried Supply
Minister, the P.M. has tried to tell motorists
and their organisations that, far from consider-
ing the abolition of petrol rationing, his Gov-
ernment intends a tightening-up, not by cutting
the ration but by refusing extra supplies to
people seeking them for various reasons. He
said further that unless Australia cut consump-
tion by a couple of million gallons it would
find itself short before long. Motorists and
their organisations remain sceptical, especially
as Mr. Chifley gave no figures of imports and
consumption, and made no reference to the
great quantities of petrol consumed in road
haulage because strike-dominated Government
transport has fallen down on its job.
Nobody now believes that petrol rationing
in Australia helps Britain in any way. Canada
and South Africa, which are helping Britain in
every way, have abolished rationing and N.Z.
has virtually done so—there consumption
actually decreased when the coupon system
was abandoned. The Government cannot really
believe that the private motorist would suffer
through abolition of rationing. Most private
cars are old and many are falling to pieces for
want of parts; new cars can be got only under
permit and the prices are prohibitive to most
people. Before long there’ll be thousands of
old cars off the roads—few people even now
will risk long, unessential journeys. A rationing
system which costs a quarter of a million a
year has long since ceased to serve any good
purpose and the blundering Government only
makes the position worse when it allows the
pool system to be abandoned while rationing
is continued. The suspicion remains that
“Labor” sticks to rationing because it would
otherwise oblige fuel-control employees to find
other jobs.


THE NOT-SO-GRAND PARADE.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Uco”: Biggest mystery in the case in
which T. J. Ley was found guilty of mur-
dering John Mudie lay not in the in-
volved Crime Club plot whereby Ley con
trived to get the unfortunate man into his
hands, nor did it concern the witness who
made a hurried trip from Switzerland
and back. On the evidence the case
seemed clear, and Lord Chief Justice
Goddard in his summing-up left little
room for doubt about his view of the
evidence. But the incredible thing is the
motive—jealousy. A crime passionel com-
mitted by a hot-blooded youth is under-
standable ; so, too, is a jealousy killing
by a man in the “dangerous” forties,
but Ley was a tough businessman and
ex-politician of 66, and his paramour no
young thing to dazzle the eyes of an
elderly lover, but a woman of his own
age. Yet insensate jealousy seems to be
the whole story. The trial recalls a
strange sequel to the election campaign
in which Ley, who had been M.L.A. for
Hurstville and St. George and Minister
of Public Instruction, Labor and Industry
and Justice, won the Federal seat of
Barton, now held by Dr, Evatt. His
opponent. Frederick Albert McDonald,
made serious charges against Ley, alleg-
ing attempted bribery. Ley replied with a
writ for £15,000 damages. Four months
after polling day McDonald wrote a
letter withdrawing and apologising for
his charges. A month later he disap-
peared and has never been seen since.

“Zake”: Wearing stilt-heeled shoes,
knee-length skirt and a flapperish hat,
she walked slowly down one of those
narrow one-way-traffic streets which
seem tb have been devised by some early
►Sydney town-planner while on a binge.
A car crawled past the row of parked
cars, but couldn’t pass the walking figure.
A toot on the horn moved her not. At
last a couple of vacant spaces on the
park-line allowed the driver to go round
her. As he drew opposite her at a crawl
he poked out his head and said “Hey,
sister, you want to walk on the road. If
you use the footpath you might get run
over.” The “flapper” turned on him a
dial that belonged to a mid-fiftyish woman
who had seen quite a bit of life. As he
cruised slowly by she reached over,
grabbed his hat and pulled it over his
eyes. “Look where y’re goin’, brother!”

“Ex-C.G.”: Warrnambool, the little

whence sprang J. F. Archibald of
The Bulletin, celebrated its centenary
last week with the usual carnivals and
speeches by visiting bigwigs. It’s a long
time since I went to school there as a
small boy, but I still remember the tele-
graph pole in Leibig-street up which three
of us climbed to investigate a pee-wee’s
nest —they had to get the police force and
fire brigade out to get us down again—
and the sandstone quarries up near the
old Anglican church which, in my time
anyhow, were haunted by the ghosts of
the sailors who were allegedly drowned
when the ship La Belle sunk off the
breakwater. Warrnambool, unlike other
Victorian cities, didn’t spring up quickly
from gold discoveries or other sudden de-
velopments. Like Topsy, it “just growed,”
a steady growth based mainly on spuds,
onions, pigs, sheep and milk. What
really put it on the map for Australians
was the Warrnambool -to - Melbourne
bike race, 165 miles, an event almost
as sacred to Victorians as the Melbourne
Cup.

“Ad Rem”: With time on their hands,
30 rare varieties of femininity recently
teamed up in Melbourne to form a
branch of the British Cat Protection
League. One dear admitted to maintain-
ing 43 stray moggies and 17 Of her own
—on a weekly tucker bill of £4 10s. “We
need all the little cats,” she said. “They
are useful, and if we go on destroying
them we will have a dreadful plague,”
The “Herald” pictured a member of the
household staff treating Mitty and
Mumphy to specially-prepared milk. -
Discussion was diverse and theories
often clashed, but there was one point on
which unanimity was reached: “When
your cat has kittens, destroy all the
females immediately.” Did somebody
say cats ?

“1.D.”; Two jobs were advertised in a
Brisbane paper, one for a qualified bac-
teriologist and the other for a Rugby
“ Don't you think you were silly knockin' back this Consolidated Steel
Company's offer?"
League player-coach. Applicants for the
first position had to be graduates in
science from a recognised university, and
would be required to work in the labora-
tory of Microbiology and Pathology of
the Department of Health and Home
Affairs. Femalfe applicants were offered
£235 per annum, a wage which “includes
the recent rise in the cost of living.” The
footballer was offered £2O a week during
the season, and an ensured job at £7 ‘a
week during the summer. No qualifica-
tions were required for the “ensured
job.”

“Curtain Raiser”: Lud Mayor Con-
nelly, of Melbourne, criticised about the
acoustics of his Town Hall, said recently
that any hall with good sound accommo-
dation was an acoustical fluke. Quite
so ; few architects would guarantee per-
fect acoustics, and there are examples of
good halls being copied down to the last
detail and turning out so bad that they
had to be completely altered. With even
a well-designed hall the acoustics vary
with the weather —and the fashions. If
a cold snap brings all the ladies in furs
and the men in overcoats the sound is
dampened down just as much as if some
absorbent material had been hung on the
walls and ceiling. There was a marked
difference to be noticed between the
acoustics of Melbourne’s civic hall in
pre-war days and during war-time.
Boiled shirts gave way to khaki, and the
bouncing back of the sound vibrations
was sensibly diminished.
* * ♦ *
“North”: Sydneysiders aren’t the only
ones with rent to worry about. Living
in the Flinders Ranges (with magnificent
scenery that trippers come from N.S.W.
to see) our landlord, too, has his
moments. The house isn’t a bad one as
they come these days; five stone rooms,
plus wash-house, bathroom, lobby and
verandah. There’s a stone motor shed,
and such privileges as use of a windmill
for a vegetable garden, free wood, a shed
for lumber and a fowl-house. The
plumbing is as primitive as that in
Sydney’s £l5-a-week seaside shacks. The
old chap was apologetic when it came to
terms: £l3. The other day he refused
to take the cash for the coming season.
“The £l3 more than covered the house
insurance,” he murmured, “and that’s all
I want out of it.” Yes, the £l3 is per
annum.
* * * *
“Jasby”: The old saying that it is
impossible to please everyone was exem-
plified in the Sydney press last week by
two news items coming from places half
a world apart. At Falmouth (Eng.) at
the funeral of a ship’s officer a Rev.
Thomas Elkington said:
I solemnly curse all those in this port,
and in every port, who deliberately use
such tactics as placing methylated spirits
in the beer of seamen to the damnation of
their bodies, and all those who incite those
weaker than themselves to inebriation.
He claimed that the metho was slipped
into the men’s drink to make them easier
victims for thieves. The other item was'
a local one —the proprietor of a Redfern
(Sydney) wine saloon was charged with
selling adulterated wine. It wasn’t
metho that had been added, but water
—a bottle analysed showed 26 p.c. of
the horrid stuff. The defendant’s plea
might have appealed to the Falmouth
padre, but it didn’t impress the magistrate.
When the defending solicitor claimed that
his client’s son had watered the wine to
prevent outbreaks of violence in the
saloon the magistrate commented that
such action was more likely to cause
violence than to prevent it. Quite right,
too. If that’s the sort of thing that goes
on in Redfern it’s no wonder one of
its best-known sons has moved to Yarra-
lumla,
“Bo”: Swaying on a strap, the drunk
in the next compartment had maintained
a ceaseless -chatter interspersed with
raucous vocal items for almost two sec-
tions before he fished from his hip-pocket
a bottle of beer. A cheer went up from
the male passengers in the compartment
at the rare sight, and the two lady pas-
sengers exchanged understanding nods.
Then, as someone playfully grabbed the
bottle from the drunk, who immediately
emitted a bellow like that of a bull calf
and demanded his sanguinary possession
back, one of the dames turned to the
other and said: “There! That’s how
strong drink maddens a man!” A fat
little cove opposite them leaned across,
tapped one of the women on the knee
and said “Y’re wrong, missus. It ain’t
the strong stuff that maddens a man —
its the stuff that’s so weak it collapses in
the glass as soon as it comes out o’ the
beer pump that gets a bloke that way.”
* * * *
“Spokeshave”: Harmonious relations
between Victoria and Tasmania have been
strained by the discovery that Rodondo
Island, brought into prominence by the
visit of a Geelong schoolmaster and his
pupils, belongs to the Apple Island. Pitt,
the Tasmanian Surveyor-General, has an-
nounced that a declaration by the then
Governor of Tassie, Colonel George
Arthur, on December 17, 1825, fixed the
northern boundary of Tasmania as lati-
tude 39 degrees 12 minutes. This not
only puts Rodondo but the small Hogan
Group near by under Tasmanian juris-
diction. A conference of the population
is now being held to consider the situa-
tion, and it is reliably reported that the
muttonbirds and penguins aie strongly
in favor of Mr. Cain’s administration,
while the seals prefer the more enlight-
ened rule of Mr. Cosgrove and his col-
leagues. A Communist minority, chiefly
composed of mollyhawks, is agitating for
complete independence, pointing out that
neither Mr. Cain nor Mr. Cosgrove seems
competent to deal with the housing short-
age, most urgently felt among the mutton-
birds, which have hitherto enjoyed the
individualistic privilege of one-hole-one-
family, but have lately been driven to a
crowded collectivism on a large scale.
The proximity of the islands to the main-
land has made the problem of defence an
acute one, and all scientists have been
mobilised for atomic; research work and
been compelled to take an oath of
secrecy. The Tasmanian Government is
reported to have despatched a gunboat
filled with tax-collectors and other
officials armed to the teeth with empty
files and red tape, to an unknown desti-
nation.

“Niloc”: After the Allies found that
by dropping bundles of metal foil from a
few aircraft at frequent intervals they
could persuade the massive German radar
stations along the French coast that huge
waves of planes were coming over, and
that by specialised “jamming” the Fritz
mechanical ears could be deafened to
any approaching force, they made good
use of the discovery. When the real in-
vading force set out for Normandy on
D-Day with a maximum of “jamming,” a
fake force of aircraft began dropping tons
of foil further down the Channel. Small
ships, towing a multitude of barrage
balloons, added to the German illusion
that a lot of trouble was cooking up in
that area, and it was not until the
authentic invading force was closing on
the beaches that Fritz realised that he
had been the victim of what must have
been the greatest hoax in warfare since
the Trojan horse.
* * * *
“Laetitia”: In the half-light of dawn
the official sighted his quarry and gave
chase. The man at the wheel of
the speeding van weaved a tortuous route
through suburban byways in an attempt
to shake off his pursuer, who drove with
the accelerator flat on the floorboards.
At last, in a blind street, the quarry drew
over to the kerb and pulled up. The in-
spector policing the extra-hours delivery
of bread threw open the door of the
baker’s van, to find it as bare as Mother
Hubbard’s cupboard. He asked fiercely
“What were you running away for when
you had no bread on board?” “I wasn’t
running away,” said the carter. “I often
go for a hell-for-leather drive through
the suburbs in the early morning before
I load up the bread for my rounds. I
thought you must have been another
bloke who liked the same kind of game.”
• * * •
“Hackshaw”: Unique in copyrighting
is C. K. Ogden’s assignment of the copy-
right of Basic English to the Crown for
£23,000. In Java there is one language
for the lower class and another for the
upper class; but that has been fixed by
custom. As far as I understand it, the
idea of B.E. is to make one word do the
job of 20 by the use of prepositions.
Thus go in, out, up, down, forwards,
backwards, round, etc., replace enter,
emerge, ascend, descend, advance, retire,
circumnavigate, etc. Most good speakers
and writers do this instinctively, using
the Latin-rooted words only when
they express their meaning better.
There are 850 words in Basic, that
figure being expanded to 1000 for
Ogden’s version of the New Testament.
After reading some of the most hallowed
passages in the Gospels in that version
I wanted to go after the professor with
a meataxe, not because his translation
was necessarily worse, but because it
violated my associations. Associations
play an enormous part in literary appre-
ciation.
* * * *
“Plop”: One of the greatest outlets in
the world for the highly peeved is the
Letters to The Editor section of the
London “Times.” Sherlock Holmes got
clues from it, and no doubt he could have
put a case together from the recent howl
of one irate gent., who has probably since
burst his boiler despite the “Times’s'
safety valve. This gentleman wrote that
during a 8.8. C. broadcast of “Madame
Butterfly” a soprano hit a particularly
high note and hung on to it until a thick
“unbreakable” tumbler filled with water
turned it in on his mantlepiece;
“exploded with a loud report into
a thousand pieces.... fragments were
scattered over my wife and self
and the greater part of the r00m....
I have tried the note since by tapping a
similar tumbler and found that it must
have been a high E or F.” The aggrieved
party ended with the inevitable warning:
“One of these fine days serious damage
may be caused, resulting in a possible
lawsuit.”
IN SEARCH OF A PEDIGREE.
“The Governor-General, Mr. MeKell, has written
to the Scottish Ancestry Research Council asking
that a complete investigation be made of hia
ancestry.”
Wanted —a well-attested family tree,
A signed certificate of pedigree,
By an Australian citizen of late
Promoted to proconsular estate,
Who feels he can no longer rest content
To know so little of his own descent,
And scanty solace from the thought can shape
We all go back to Adam —or the ape.
Wanted —a missing genealogy.
A warrant of authentic ancestry.
Who were his forebears? Warriors who played
Their part with Highland claymore and with
Made,
Stout fellows from the land of cakes and ferns
Who bled with Wallace or who drank with
Burns?
What clan is it whose fame he hopes to share?
What tartan, if he chooses, can he wear?
(And what an apt appendage one would be
To the regalia of a C.-in-C.,
You must admit). But' all these things must
wait
For Scottish experts to elucidate.
Say, what about a coat-of-arms as well
To add fresh lustre to your name, MeKell?
The Herald’s College, Queen Victoria Street,
Surely exists such needs as yours to meet.
There you may purchase, if you’re game to pay,
Enough armorial blarings any day,
From trotters rampant down to begging bowls,
To satisfy the most exacting souls.
And for a fitting motto I suggest
To show the why and wherefore of your crest,
No Latin tag could be more luminous
Than Labor Omnia Vincit Improbus.
N.S.W,
T. THE R.


“Dook”: It’s not only over this ques-
tion of giving up seats in trams that the
sexes join battle. A train in which I was
travelling stopped at a station where a
number of factory workers got on. One
young fellow, determined to reach the
door first, was pushing his way through
a group of girls on the platform. A
ringing female voice halted him just as
victory was in sight. “Make way for
the gentleman, ladies!” it shouted.
♦ * * *
“Eureka”; There’s a movement afoot
to raise funds to restore the tomb of
Lachlan Macquarie, who is buried on the
Island of Mull, and another agitation
to bring the tomb of Governor Bligh to
Sydney. Meanwhile many historic tombs
in this country are sadly in need of
attention; it is impossible to get near
many of them for weeds and rubbish. In
St. John’s cemetery, Parramatta, Camper-
down cemetery at Newtown 'and other
old burial grounds at Liverpool, Wind-
sor, Ryde and elsewhere in N.S.W. there
are dozens of really historic tombs which
are in a shocking state of neglect, but
nothing is done about it, except an agita-
tion now and then to close the grounds
and make them into parks or play-
grounds.
* # # *
“Spokeshave”; Every fresh batch of
city councillors in Melbourne wants to
preserve the beauty of the city, every
fresh batch deplores what its predecessors
have done and every fresh batch does
exactly the same thing. In the result
many a picturesque link with the past has
vanished, though not all. One of the ex-
ceptions stands to the credit of an insur-
ance company which, when it put up a
new building, designed it in such a way
as to preserve an old hostelry with
its hitching post still the resort
of artists, tired businessmen and even
“She struggled!"
of councillors who feel that nos-
talgic feeling we all feel for the past.
Bayside councils haven’t any architec-
tural relics they can put the axe to, but
they have the natural beauties of the
foreshores. Few of the Melburnians who
stream down to the beaches at the week-
ends know that the magnificent coastal
bush with its giant banksias, flowering
three and other characteristic flora, which
stretches from the Leeuwin almost up
to Brisbane, once flourished along the
foreshores of Port Phillip. Odd clumps
of titrees are the sole reminders of it
and even these will go when the £2,000,000
seawall has been built from Williams-
town to Frankston.
* * * *
“Wusslean”: One of the visitors to
the Boy Scout camp showed special in-
terest in the firelighting contest, in which
no paper was used and two matches
only were issued to each contestant.
When the show was over he offered to
do the job with a quarter of a match.
Producing a safety-razor blade, he slit
a match skilfully down the centre, bi-
secting the head, then slit each half in
two. Holding one of the pieces close
to the head, he was able to strike it
without breaking the stick, now reduced
to the thickness of a toothpick. “Did
you learn that in the Scouts, sir?” in-
quired one of the lads. The- expert gave
a wry smile, and shook his head. “In
Salonika, on the way to a German jail,”
he said.
* * * *
“Horsefeathers”: In a Perth suburb a
willy-willy swooped down the chimney of
a house and scattered the glowing embers
in the stove; and in a few minutes the
hessian-lined dwelling was in flames.
Everything was destroyed. When the
owner returned from work, did he sit
down and winge? Or go snivelling to
the “Gov’ment” for a handout? He did
not. He not only knocked back an
. offer of cash from an official, but,
salvaging some corrugated-iron, he com-
menced immediately to repair an old
shed to house his family. Such behavior
completely staggered the. neighbors. The
fellow must be a Pom or a Ding or one
of them blanky independent foreigners!
* sjs * at
“Melbn”: A woman who, after stand-
ing in a queue for an hour in Melbourne
and then being offered a small leg of
lamb for 12s. and objecting, was nearly
knocked down in the rush when the
butcher shouted “Who wants this leg of
lamb for twelve bob?” Another woman,
determined to get her husband’s dinner,
found a crocodile a quarter of a mile
long stretching along a city pavement.
Ignoring the queue, she went straight to
the door and started to work her way
through. The indignation she aroused
was terrific and the language from both
male and female queuers purple. Turn-
ing to her abusers she said, “There are
two policemen over there. I will call
them and have you all arrested on three
counts —obstructing the traffic, using
abusive language and forming a queue
in the street, which is illegal.” Dead
silence fell and she walked in and de-
manded to be served, quoting a regula-
tion that a customer can be served at any
part of a counter. Then she emerged
triumphant with her trophy. There is
nothing like a bit of legal knowledge—
if it was such.
» * * «
“Minto”: Those pars, about telegraph
operators call to mind the skill of the
ground radio operators who keep in
touch with aircraft. Apart from having
to sift out one particular aircraft’s signal
from the rest they have static to contend
with, and when static is at its worst dur-
ing storms they are always at their busi-
est. Returning from Darwin one trip I
had difficulty in raising Cloncurry
Aeradio, though our position in the air
was no more than 100 miles from the
station ; this was due to what is known
as “skip distance.” We had stretcher
cases on board and I was asking for a
meal to be ready on arrival at Clon-
curry. The operator at Townsville picked
■up my message, passed it to Cairns,
Caims passed it to Cooktown, Cook-
“No funny business , Madam — I've brought me own cards."
town y Karumba and from Karumba to
Gove (on the Gulf), Gove passed it on
to Daly Waters and finally Daly Waters
to Cloncurry within five minutes of my
original call. Cloncurry answered me
and a hot meal was ready for the sick
when we landed. But good as they were
I’ve never forgiven the Aeradio lads for
a comment on my own operating. After
trying in vain to read my message, a
ground operator asked me to “use the
other foot, please.”
* * * *
“Brier”: A “S. M. Herald” writer who
“discovered” two brand-new words is
sadly behind the times. The first of these,
“relaxative,” describing a week-end in the
country, has long been used by American
advertisers of patent medicines. The
second, “incomepoop,” is older still.
“Punch” .in 1883 used it to describe a
notorious spendthrift,
* * * *
“Flathead”: Dust at our local flea-
hatchery had just settled after a
comedy cartoon showing that quaint
creature “Goofy” learning to swim when
a secondary wave of laughter hit the
place. It was louder than the usual remi-
niscent chortles which go through an
audience after viewing Disney’s humor,
and just happened to coincide with an
announcement on the screen that we were
about to see the weighing-in ceremonies
of His Excellency W. J. McKell.
Walt’s preceding effort must have been
a classic, for, as this newsreel moved on
the roars grew even louder. When, with
other members, Menzies shook the
new G.-G.’s hand, he too was obviously
vibrating with suppressed laughter. I
still don’t know whether the mirth could
be attributed to Goofy’s performance of
a fish out of water, or whether the audi-
ence had somehow connected him with
a later character who, in their eyes, was
playing a similar role.
* * * •
“D.M.E.”: Revisiting Egypt for my
second war I missed one particular
Gyppo. Original Anzacs will recall Ab-
dul, the Manure King. To his discarded
Aussie tunic someone attached two
stripes, naming him “Captain” Manure,
which a slicker name later replaced. On
inquiry by the Officer of the Day “Why
the refuse had not been removed,” he was
told “It was kept there for Captain
Manure.” “Who is Captain Manure?” he
demanded. Out of the trench stepped
Abdul, who with toothy smile explained
“I Captain Manure. I very good.”
* * * *
“Lawnstob”: The peculiar terminology
of the army led to a quaint mistake in
the Apple Island. Launceston Fire
Brigade wanted particulars of some “fire-
control” apparatus offered for sale by
Army Disposals. It turned out that the
apparatus did control fire, but it was the
fire of machine-guns.
* * * •
“Exdig”: That “surprising to find
what a number of oaths had a religious
origin” (B. 19/3/’47) is surely a slip;
by the very nature of the word, an oath
should have a religibus start. What I
found surprising, however, was to hear
the most virulent torrent of obscenity in
my memory flow from a parson’s lips.
1 knew him first as a parson and 1 knew
he had preceded me into the ranks, but
when I got to France it was to find him
the bad man of the battalion ; his nerves
had not been able to stand up to his
good intentions and he was in such a
state of low morale that he had to be
compulsorily bathed. One night in a
strongpost he was missing from his post;
when found, groaning in a corner and
ordered back, he ,released the surprising
verbal stream. We were relieved that
night; while I was talking to the sergeant,
a kindly, understanding chap who had
already reported him as a man with
“nerves shot to pieces and fit only for
the horse-lines,” the ex-parson came for-
ward to apologise. The sarge said there
was no need to apologise ; he knew the
man’s nerves were gone. “Yes, sergeant;
but as a man of God I should never have
used those words,” he said. Too right he
shouldn’t! But where in the world did
he learn them?
“Findy”; Certainly those Japanese
four-line poems quoted by “Loc” (B.
5/3/’47) seem flat, but in the original
they may convey a picture of surpassing
beauty to Nipponese minds. Verse is not
meant to be rendered into prose, and one
of the most ridiculous practices in school
English is the question which asks the
student to “express in your own words
what the poet meant when he wrote the
following lines.” Shakspeare, Keats or
Tennyson has chosen from all the
language the words which alone can ex-
press the exact shade of meaning he
wishes to convey, and Jones Minor is
asked to express the same thought in his
own words! There are no other words
to express just that thought. Even Jones
Minor is dimly aware of this and the
knowledge probably influenced him when
a teacher with a mind dead to poetry
asked him to paraphrase the first verse
of Shelley’s “Hail to thee, blithe spirit.”
J.M.’s effort began: “Wotcher, skylark!
You never was a bird.”
* * * »
“QwertYuiop”: The quiz craze has its
uses in revealing the often uncanny in-
sight of modern youth into world-
politics. Asked “What is the Kremlin?”
a 12-year-old girl replied “The place
where Gremlins come from.” And for
most of the worst of them which haunt
us by press and wireless, that child was
perfectly right, even if they didn’t give
her the prize.
* * * *
“McGlum”: It is doubtful if you could
find one Eighth Divvy boy who has eaten
rice since his liberation. We did not
realise until our return just how much
we desired to hate this emblem of the
Jap way of living. Roger had been our
very good friend. We buried him on
the hilltop overlooking the paddy fields,
used his watch and clothing to buy rice
and reckoned we owed his mother £2O.
Back in Australia three of us arranged
to call on her. A widow, she had battled
to keep a small Gippsland farm going
and even now had no intention of quit-
ting. We sat down to the first meal of
a week’s holiday. The roast duck was
delicious. Then our hostess almost made
a speech. “Roger had a favorite pudding
and I was determined that he should
have it first meal home. We couldn’t get
the stuff during the war; and still can’t.
But I saved some for when he came
home. Now” She burst into tears,
rushed into the kitchen and came back
carrying a x huge rice pudding. The three
of us did the impossible. We ate it —
every grain!
A MOOT QUESTION.
Come, let us turn aside a mo.
From the delinquencies of Corns.,
From themes of war and want and woe,
From Bretton Woods and atom bombs,
And lend attentive ears to what
Distinguished scientists discuss,
The baffling problem whether or not
Our dingoes are indigenous.
Some hold them native fauna, true
Products of Austral ancestry,
Contemporaneous with the ’roo,
The platypus and wallaby.
They subtly hint that pride of place
Should fairly be assigned to us
As cradle of the canine race,
Where dingoes are indigenous.
Others as stubbornly aver
In centuries remote and dim
The abo. brought his faithful cur
Through northern seas along with him.
If so, it seems you can’t ignore
The inference presented thus
That man and hound alike are more
Exotic than indigenous.
Come, what a pleasant change ’twould be
From points for hot and high debate,
The functions of democracy,
Problems of Commonwealth and State,
Some interest in the theme to show
About which naturalists fuss,
The unsolved puzzle whether or no
Our dingoes are indigenous.

trar in Divorce.
THE SERVICE MAN
WHO SHOULD BE COURTMARTIALLED?
“Ek Dum”: In their present state of
panic and disorder Federal Ministers,
whenever they touch a service question,
lose their heads and give away their true
feelings.
There was no trouble about voting
appearance money to wharfies (especially
since somebody else was paying it), and
nobody on the Government side has ever
enlarged on the lavish treatment of the
mob of military-age‘young strikers who
loafed on the country to such an extent
that even a “Labor” Government drafted
them into the Army—that is into a com-
fortable work-free camp from which
they soon emerged refreshed arid with
pockets well-lined.
Comfort in the Tyrol
When Mr. Turnoull, himself an ex-
p.-0.-w., moved the adjournment of the
House to secure discussion of the pro-
posed payment of 3s. a day to former
prisoners of the Japanese as subsistence
money, Mr. Chifley remarked; “Some
prisoners suffered great hardship, but in
other cases, for instance in camps in the
Austrian Tyrol, the treatment was good.”
Good it was —by p.-0.-w. standards —
when the prisoners got there, though
not what Mr. Chifley’s ardent supporters
in the Miners’ and Ironworkers’ and
Wharfies’ Unions, all enemies of prefer-
ence to fighting men, and proud of their
own records of war-time strikes, stop-
pages and go-slow, would have called
“good.”
Before the men reached the Tyrol
camps they had been through bitter fight-
ing. They had endured cold, hunger, ill-
treatment and ignominy at the hands of
guards. They did not receive a penny
of the disgraceful blackmail called
danger-pay without which wharfies would
not handle a case of badly- and urgently-
needed .303 in. ammunition for the North,
to say nothing of “stench pay” at 10s. an
hour. They were not privileged to live
in their homes with their wives and child-
ren. They did not get special cigarette
issues, nor were the pubs opened for them
at special times. If they had enjoyed the
privilege of striking against their
country, which wharfies and coalminers
and ironworkers not only enjoyed but
were proud of, they would have been
shot for mutiny. And since “Labor”
apparently regards all these things as the
privilege of the non-fighting “worker, ’
the fighting worker should have them,
even if he was immured in a “comfort-
able camp.”
The Government would not have
dared to send off the pampered unionists
whom it transported to safe regions of
the North for light work during the war
without giving them double pay. If this
country had any sense of responsibility it
would demand an inquiry into the
manner in which money was flung round
to privileged unionists during the war in
order to placate them.
However, as Mr. Chifley admitted,
“some” prisoners suffered great hardship.
They did. “Some”—thousands of them
—will never be the same men again. All
these have been relegated to the specially
unprivileged classes, as they realised long
ago. Some are dead ; more are dying.
Following Mr. Chifley, Mr. Pollard —
Minister for Commerce and Agriculture —
came upon the scene. His contribution
was the more disgraceful to him because
he is one of the few returned soldiers in
the Ministry, which is probably why he
frequently has the air of wondering how
he got there. His contribution:
I say with great diffidence that Army
regulations lay down that to be made a
prisoner-of-war is a courtmartial offence.
I am not reflecting on any of the men
who surrendered at the capitulation of
Singapore, nor am I reflecting on the men
who were taken prisoner on the Malay
Peninsula before the capitulation. The
plain fact is military authorities say being
taken prisoner is a courtmartial offence.
This was very kind indeed of Mr.
Pollard, especially in the circumstances.
But he omits one very relevant piece of
information —the names of the “military
authorities” from behind whose shelter
he uttered his innuendo, which carried
the implication to the lay mind that there
was something illegal and disgraceful in
becoming a p.-0.-w.
The fact is that a courtmartial can be
demanded to determine almost anything
in military life which reflects on the
honor of a soldier.
Surrender, in proper circumstances,
however, is not only not a crime but it
is a course which any commander would
disgrace himself by not taking, since per-
sistence in a hopeless defence with no
way of retreat would involve unjustifi-
able slaughter. And if he takes it soldiers
are bound to obey him or be guilty of a
serious offence at the risk of their com-
rades’ lives.
If the commander in Malaya felt as
Mr. Pollard feels there would be no
problem of subsistence to war prisoners.
Like the unfortunate civilians of Rabaul
and the forgotten men of Sandakan,
they would all be dead.
The Law of P.-0.-W.
The fact that rigid and extensive con-
ventions —the Australian Government
altered its Constitution to allow this
country to become a party to some of
them in 1937 —prescribe modes of sur-
render and the manner of treatment of
prisoners proves that surrender in proper
circumstances is a recognised part of
honorable warfare. And any admission to
the contrary is a reversion to savagery. It
is especially monstrous on the part of a
Minister of the Crown, sjnce it is certain
that if we are pitted against a barbarous
and ruthless enemy in a future war, Mr.
Pollard’s words will be used to justify the
"Shut the door, sailor! There's quite a draught!"
foe in treating any of those captured as
persons in disgrace with their own
country. This view has not been held by
any modern nation save the Japanese.
The provisions under which surrender
may take place are basically set out in the
British Manual of Military Law, under
which our men were operating in Malaya,
since they were under overall British
Command —in Chapter XIV, iv (“Capitu-
lations”) ; and also in the Army Act,
Part I (“Discipline”), Section 4.
The section on capitulations states
that so long as the surrender is in accord,
with the laws of war, the recognised
leader of even a small party, even
if he is not an officer, may surrender his
men. “The senior of the party” or even
an “individual” in such cases may, “so
far as concerns the party or his own
person, do everything which a com-
mander might do with respect to himself
and the troops under his command.” The
rules for negotiation for surrender are
then described.
The Army Act, Section 4, says:
Every person subject to military law who
....shamefully abandons or delivers up
any garrison, place, post or guard or uses
any means to compel or induce any gov-
ernor, commanding officer or other person
shamefully to abandon [a place] which it
was the duty of such governor, officer or
other person to defend shall on convic-
tion by courtmartial be liable to suffer
death, or such less punishment as is in
this Act mentioned.
A note in the official Manual of
Military Law adds: “This offence can
only be committed by the person in
charge of the garrison, etc., and not by
a subordinate under his command.”
The terms under which surrender is
permissible are clearly set out —shortage
of provisions, of water, absence of hope
of relief, certainty that the enemy can
take the garrison and its arms and am-
munition.
All these operated at Singapore, and
there was no talk of surrender until they
were urgently evident.
It is added:
Particulars of a charge must deal with
some circumstances which make the aban-
donment in a military sense shameful.
The “Government’s” Shame
If this country had done its duty and
had not shirked its job, it would have
had three or four divisions at Singapore
instead of one. And it would have had
them equipped with their own weapons,
and with their own transport and air
support. That it did not have this force
there, a force which would have been
enough to hold the island, was largely
due to the policy forced on the country
by the party to which Mr. Chifley, Mr.
Pollard and Mr. Chambers belong.
Before 1939 “Labor” leaders were
opposed to sending men to “die in the
quagmire of Europe” (Mr. Curtin’s
phrase, uttered in 1938). Yet when it
came to defending Australia’s front gate,
Mr. Curtin and his followers were
all for Britain. And Britain spared
divisions even when her cities were
under fire and her civilians working uni-
versally 12 hours a day (and sometimes
doing Home Guard duty afterwards), to
“die in the quagmire” of Asia, so that
Australians could remain at home and do
useful jobs like wharflaboring (when in-
clined), and take advantage of the magni-
ficent opportunities so frequently pointed
out by Mr. Ernie Thornton, of the Iron-
workers, to join in blackmailing strikes
for higher wages. When Singapore fell
it was the Curtins and the Chifleys who
yelled for 25 divisions of British and
American troops to come and die in what
they expected to be the quagmire of
Australia, where, with the backing of
some leading members of the party, there
had just been a large-scale munition
strike to secure the release of two Com-
munist officials, who had been caught
working on the practical details of the
plan to sabotage munition work as a
preliminary to “something bigger in time
and space.”
This is the Government whose Minister
sternly points out that “it is a court-
martial offence to surrender to the
enemy,” and who fails to say:—-
(1) That the surrender at Singapore was
twice voted for by its accredited repre-
sentative at the conferences held before
the surrender took place.
(2) That the Curtin Government en-
dorsed the decision.
(3) That it afterwards, so far from think-
ing his action due for courtmartial, made
the general who represented it at the sur-
render-decision conferences its adviser and
promoted him.
(4) That any soldier who had refused
the order to surrender when given by a
constituted authority would have been
guilty of a very serious offence, in certain
circumstances carrying the death penalty.
Disobedience in breach of an agreement
could have led to wholesale reprisals, per-
haps wholesale slaughter.
There was actually in the Middle East
a case in which an Australian fired a
shot after his officer had surrendered his
troops. He killed an enemy soldier.
The enemy courtmartialled and shot him.
Mr. Pollard said nothing about the
thousands of Australians who died, many
civilians wantonly sacrificed through
Canberra neglect and dithering at
Rabaul. Nothing about the dreadful
deaths of the thousands of Sandakan,
whom the Government made not the
slightest attempt to rescue or succor,
even thdugh it had information that
something could be done, and though
it knew that the place was so
open that Filipino guerillas had
succeeded in penetrating to the en-
virons of the prison camp, and in actu-
ally taking some of their meagre arms
ashore to be planted for further use.
If Mr. Pollard and his associates think
that some courtmartials would be in
order, they should courtmartial those of
their own number who had the control
of the Rabaul, Ambon, Java and Singa-
pore affairs at the Canberra end. There
has been no inquiry into any of these
tragedies, though there were precedents
in the Gallipoli and Mesopotamia in-
quiries, to the first of which Mr. Andrew
Fisher was a party.
If anybody were punished for culpa-
bility in connection with the Malayan
campaigns, for the deaths of survivors and
the ruin of hundreds of homes and lives
of dependents and the leaving of mothers
and wives weeping and children father-
less, it certainly would not be members
of the Eighth Division.
A Non-party Matter!
To Mr. Pollard in the debate succeeded
Mr.. Chambers, the Army Minister,
author of the sneer which described the
unfortunate fighting men of Borneo and
the Siam railways as “these men” ; who
apparently found himself fairly cornered.
He pleaded that the matter should be
treated as “a non-party one.”
All through the war everything was
treated from a party point of view. When
the “Government” took office, having
known and publicly approved of every-
thing which the previous Government
had done, so long as it reduced the war
effort to a comfortable minimum, it made
a party issue of the war.
It admitted no good of its opponents.
Its consultations with them were as desul-
tory as possible. Anything brought for-
ward by the Opposition was Voted out
sedulously and, in open debate, howled
down as a matter of course. For consul-
tants the “Government” preferred a body
of trade-union secretaries, most of whom
had been involved in the wage strikes of
1940 and in the strikes on behalf of in-
terned Communists in 1941.
These were the men whom a “Labor”
Ministry met in secret session, while the
Oppositionists were raucously denounced
as the inventors of the “Brisbane Line,”
and Mr. Ward announced his regret that
he could not criminally prosecute them
for their neglect of the defence of the
country —which he himself had done
everything in his power to completely in-
hibit, even to bringing down a Bill to pre-
vent the sending of militia to defend
Papua, New Guinea and —yes —Norfolk
Island.
But now Mr. Chambers is suddenly,
when in a bad corner, imbued with a
“national” spirit in defence. He says it
is something that should be treated as
a non-party matter! In this particular
case it should be very much a party
matter. The men who most need the sub-
sistence allowances —not to speak of the
widows and dependants of the dead who
should benefit —are nearly all working
men. '
“Ek Dum”: After long cogitation and
observation of p.-0.-w. reactions to the
generosity which considered £3OO a fit
reward for all the dependants of those
executed for loyalty to p.-0.-w., the Gov-
ernment decided to improve its offer. It
has arranged, or is arranging, a carefully-
balanced pension system (which surely
must have been designed by Mr. Ded-
man) under which some of the widows
of the brave Asiatics will receive as much
as 305.-355. a week pension and some of
them allowances. And certificates of
thanks will be issued setting out the ser-
vices for which rewards are made. It is
all, however, being done without pub-
licity, as if Canberra were afraid that
the Waterside Workers’ Federation might
hear that it was rewarding Indonesians
who were not anti-European. These
good people whose breadwinners died
in Australia’s service should be invited
to send two of their number to Aus-
tralia at the public cost, to be thanked by
Parliament. If the boys of Sandakan
were alive there would be recognition of
them ; but only 30-odd out of 3500 came
out of the hell-hole in which Australia’s
greatest war-time tragedy took place.
What the dead would themselves have
done is now the country’s responsibility.

PERSONAL ITEMS
In appointing Mrs. Cardell-Oliver to
Cabinet rank, the first woman in Aus-
tralia to attain that distinction, Westralia
is continuing its tradition of a broad-
minded attitude towards women in
politics. When Mrs. James Cowan won
the West Perth seat in 1921, defeating the
then Attorney-General, she became the
first woman member of an Australian
Parliament. Four years later May Hol-
man won the Forrest seat, previously held
by her father. She retained it until 1939,
when she died soon after her re-election ;
her 14 years in Parliament established
a record for an Australian woman. Miss
Holman was succeeded by her brother,
who didn’t contest the recent election.
Another Westralian feminist victory was
recorded in 1943 when Dorothy Tangney
became the first woman Senator. Mrs,
Cardell-Oliver has been a member of the
Westralian Assembly since 1936, repre-
senting Subiaco. At the 1934 Federal
elections she stood for Fremantle and
gaVe John Curtin a very good run for his
money. Her new job will be Honorary
Minister in charge of Social Services and
Assistant Minister for Migration.
Paul Hasluck, who last week told the
Department of External Affairs that in
future he would be attending to affairs
external to the department, has been
around a bit since he left his desk in the
office of the “West Australian” in 1940.
He started on that paper as a lad of 17
and combined literary work with an Arts
course at the University, gaining an M.A.
degree, and giving special attention to
history. In 1939 he became part-time
lecturer in history at the Uni., and in the
following year took up full-time duties
there. Seconded to the External Affairs
Department 12 months later, he was a
member of the Australian delegation to
the I.P.R. conference in Canada in 1942
and accompanied Dr. Evatt to San Fran-
cisco. When U.N.O. set up shop in New
York Hasluck was appointed Counsellor
to the Australian Mission, and has lately
played a prominent part in U.N.O. de-
bates.
Two famous escapees of World War I
were Colonel “Tom” White, Federal
member for Balaclava, and Group-
Captain C. W. Hill, former commandant
of the R.A.F. in Teheran. Both got into
books —Hill was the hefo of E. H.
Jones’s novel Road to Endor and White
put himself into his own book Guests
of the Unspeakable. White made his
escape by studying Turkish history, cus-
toms and language, landed in Odessa
when that city was in the hands of the
Bolsheviks and found himself as much
a fugitive as ever. He ended up a free
man in Greece four days before the
Armistice was sounded. Hill was feign-
ing madness in Constantinople hospital
when White happened to be passing and
heard a coherent whisper from a man
the guards regarded as a raving madman.
It was to the effect that he wasn’t a
madman but would soon be if he had
to keep it up much longer. The two
met again the other day when the Orion
discharged its passengers in Melbourne.
Most Australians who criticise the
quality of their daily bread are content
to blame the baker, unless they happen
to be dough-wrestlers themselves, in which
case they pass the buck on to the miller.
Dr. D. W. Kent-Jones, a British expert
on the staff of life, considers the cause
lies further back still; he claims that
until our wheat is graded instead of being
marketed as f.a.q. there can be no hope
of getting standards in flour and con-
sequently in bread. Kent-Jones is visit-
ing Australia at the invitation of the
Bread Manufacturers’ Association and
has already broken bread in N.S.W., Vic-
toria, Tasmania and S.A.
Recently appointed manager of the
Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area is Hedley
Mallaby, a Digger of World War I.
Bom and educated in Armidale (N.S.W.),
he served with the 33rd Battalion, and
on his return began work in the office
of the Irrigation Commission. He was
subsequently appointed to the Research
Branch, and is well-known for his news-
paper articles and talks over the air.
A seagull just down from Mackay (Q.),
“Standby” stalked into The Bulletin
office on his long legs and sat patiently
while Dubois drew his beak. The men-
tion of fish stimulated him to conversa-
tion, and he revealed that he had written
62 stories and sold 50 of ’em since he
began writing three years ago. Dymock’s
published a book of his yarns, Little
SEA YARNS.
Known of These Waters, and another
collection is ready for whoever wants
them. As is a novel. Sailing Orders, which
took the second prize of £5OO in “S. M-
Herald’s” competition for a war story.
Aged 50 and born in Melbourne,
“Standby” was in the Light Horse in the
first German war, in the small ships up
New Guinea way in the second. He holds
a Coastal Master’s ticket, and has done
most of his seafaring off the shores of
Queensland. Name, R. S. Porteous;
usual nickname, “Skip” ; general appear-
ance, salty.
Lieut.-Colonel J. S. Grimshaw, of S.A.,
who becomes Chief of Police of Papua
and New Guinea, has some idea of where
he’s going, having previously been at-
tached to the civil administration of those
areas. He joined the S.A. police as a
mounted constable in 1927, later served
with the C. 1.8., and became Sergeant-
Instructor at the Police Training College.
During five years with the A.I.F. he
served in the M.E. and New Guinea
campaigns, and collected a M.C. in
Greece. He’s a boxing and wrestling
enthusiast.
Besides its spiritual function the Salva-
tion Army conducts business of such
dimensions that it has an International
Trade Commissioner —John F. Lewis, at
present passing through Melbourne on
a stage of a world goodwill mission.
Born in M.L., Lewis spent 20 years (n
Australia and then went to the Army’s
h.q. in London. He is chairman of
directors of the Salvation Army Trading
Co., which prints and issues all S.A.
propaganda, makes band instruments,
of which it has more experience
than any other organisation, and
manufactures everything for Booth’s
soldiers from the banners they erect at
street corners to uniforms and boots. Its
annual turnover is in the vicinity of a
million. Commissioner Lewis is an active
71 and spent all the blitz years in Lon-
don. He has a half-century of Army
work behind him.
In Melbourne for the Australian Auto-
mobile Association’s, conference is an
ex-lud mayor—Thomas William Meagher,
M. 8., B.S. He was Perth’s First Citizen
from 1939 to last year. Born at Menzies
(W.A.), he was educated at Perth and
Melbourne Universities and practised at
Perth Hospital and privately at Victoria
Park. He is president of the Austral ian-
American Co-operation Movement, has
done a lot of globe-trotting, was an
amateur boxer of some class and is in-
terested in motoring problems from the
public standpoint.
“Squizz” on a master of salvage;
To the Melbourne offices of a marine under-
writer’s firm the message came: “Wanganella
refloated 9 p.m. sixth stop now berthed at wharf
Wellington McDonald.” That cable was typical
of the man who had just added another success
to his achievements in marine salvage. Captain
George McDonald was born in the Orkneys 51
years ago, and first went to sea in a tops’!
schooner. During the first world war he served in
several ships, including the trooper Kyarra and
the Niagara—3o years later the object of a his-
tory-making salvage operation off the New
Zealand coast. In 1917 he joined Howard
Smiths and served in many of their vessels.
Followed a spell with Melbourne Steam —he was
chief officer of its Duntroon when in 1940 he
was appointed salvage officer to the Marine
Underwriters and Salvage Association o.f Vic-
toria. Seconded two years later to the Com-
monwealth Salvage Board, he took part in
salvage operations in Australian and Pacific
waters of which little has so far been heard.
After the liner Orungal ran ashore off Barwon
Heads in December, 1940, McDonald was be-
low decks assessing the damage when he was
trapped by the fire which was later to rake the
ship. He escaped through a porthole, but
spent some time in hospital recovering from
burns. The biggest ship McDonald saved for
the Allies was the Monterey, which wient
aground off Cape Nelson, in New Britain, with
5000 American troops aboard, during a volcanic
duststorm in July, 1942. By pumping out over
80 tons of fuel oil and fresh water he refloated
her in 24 hours. In Sydney Harbor is the
Dutch steamer Van der Lijn, of Batavia,
which went ashore off Saidor, New Guinea, in
September ’44. So high and dry was the vessel
that her cargo was unloaded on to trucks along-
side. A month later, under McDonald’s direc-
tion, the rocks over which the ship had been
tossed by the gale had been blasted away,
temporary repairs carried out and the ship was
on her way south to Sydney.
In July, 1942, the Liberty ship Rufus King
ran ashore near Stradbrnke Island (Q.). Her
£3,000,000 cargo included equipment for 17 U.S.
field hospitals, a deck cargo of ten bombers
and drums of aviation fuel. The ship broke in
two, the after part remaining on a sandbank
and the fore part drifting. The crew was taken
off, but several days elapsed before the salvage
party could board the ship. Almost 98 per
cent, of the cargo was salvaged, of which 90
per cent, was reconditioned and used; the ten
bombers were flying from airfields in Australia
a fortnight after the Rufus King struck. The
part of the ship which had drifted away was
rounded up, patched with timber and concrete,
and towed into Brisbane. Moved later to
Finschhafen, it became a repair ship.
For security reasons little publicity was given
to Captain McDonald’s war-time salvage jobs,
but no one who knew his record was surprised
when the news flashed across the Tasman that
the Wanganella was afloat again.
R, C. Wright has other things in
common with Federal Opposition-leader
Menzies than the facial resemblance
noticeable in Morrissey’s drawing. He is
a barrister, has a considerable reputation
as a platform speaker and is a Liberal,
being State president of the party. Born
42 years ago at Alberton, he studied law
at Hobart University. When the war
broke out he was in partnership with A.
P. Crisp, who had won his D.S.O. with
Third Brigade artillery in the Kaiser’s
war. Crisp joined up with the guns
again and before long his partner fol-
lowed him. Wright had three years in
the Army and for part of the time he
had the unique experience for one who is
now a Liberal politician of being a mem-

ber of Prime Minister Curtin’s body-
guard. After discharge, he resumed prac-
tice and lectured in legal subjects at his
old Uni. Last year during the Powers
referendum campaign he took a leading
part in the “No” campaign—Tasmania
was one of the States that rejected the
second and third proposals—and he fol-
lowed this up by winning one of the
Franklin seats at the State elections.
Depicted here by Heth, John Charles
Webb, Lecturer-in-Charge of the Coal
Mining Division at Sydney Tech., started
off to learn his mining the hard way. He
commenced work at the coal face in an
Abertillery (Monmouthshire) pit at 14.
By attending evening classes he gained
a colliery manager’s certificate and a
diploma in mining at Crumlin Technical
College and won a scholarship to the Uni-
versity of Wales, Cardiff. Here he studied
under Professor T. David Jones, now in
Australia investigating the problem of
dust in mines. Webb graduated in science
with first class honors and later won a
M.Sc. degree for research work on dust
suppression. Then, picking up other dip-
lomas and fellowships on the way, he
worked with Jones for three years, until
they had the satisfaction of knowing fhat
as far as South Wales was concerned
dust worries were a thing of the past.

Into the silence:
In Melbourne, Mrs. Elizabeth Bleazby,
daughter of Thomas Bent, one-time Premier of
Victoria. She was a Brighton councillor for 1.7
years, acting Mayoress, and one of Melbourne’s
philanthropic leaders.
In Adelaide, at 72, William Charles Brooker,
pastor of the Queenstown Church of Christ
since 1915, when he gave up business life to
take the cloth. A former Federal president and
State president of his denomination, he was
also chairman of the Port Adelaide Seamen’s
Mission and the South Australian Alliance.
At Atlantic City (U.S.A.), at 78, Arthur'Scott

him to the university bearing that name, where
he was organist till 1904, when he went to St.
Louis to instal the pipe organ for the World
Fair there.
On Phillip Island, Vic., George Barnard Lock,

the island. He was brought there by his father,
70 years ago, and served on his father’s vessel
trading to Melbourne. A sister was the first
white child born there.
In Adelaide, at 95, Miss Ellen Thornber,
last survivor of a family of educationists and
bankers. The girls’ school of the three Misses
Thornber was ones' of Adelaide’s chief ones,

Women’s letters
From Melbourne
The lovely sweeping lawns of the
Moffat Pender home in South Yarra were
dotted with well-stocked stalls when
Mary Chomley organised a fete on be-
half of the Victoria League to raise
money for food parcels for Britain and
to send reading matter to service per-
sonnel in Japan and to isolated settlers in
the outback. Fortunately the rain held
off until the Harry Hopmans and Mrs.
Nancy Bolton had displayed their skill
on the tennis court and most of the
stalls were emptied of their wares. Then
the heavens opened and drove the guests
indoors. It must be said that inside a
house is not the ideal place for leather-
lunged Scots to be let loose with bag-
pipes. However, people who speak with
a burr in their voices seemed to like the
din made by the Toorak Pipe Band.

Westralian pianist Oriel Seeligson enter-
tained. Air Vice-Marshal R. Graham,
R.A.F., and Mrs. Graham and Mrs. R.

kins, commander of the 34th Aust. In-
fantry Brigade, Japan, to whom books
are sent by the Victoria League for the
reading-room at Anzac House, Hiro,
came along. Mrs. Robert Hamilton, Mrs.
Rupert Greene (she is president of the
Victoria League Club), Mrs. Bowen Allen
and Mrs. Lance Moore gave solid-assist-
ance to Mary Chomley.
The Mayoress of Brighton, Mrs. C. W.
W. Turner, invited over 400 guests to
farewell singer Joyce Macartney, who
leaves shortly with her husband to sing
in Canada and America. The stage of
the Town Hall was arranged in a garden
setting, with tuberoses, begonias and
maiden-hair ferns predominating. Mrs.
Turner wore a burgundy crepe frock with
a pleated skirt and pastel-pink lace yoke ;
her stiffened net hat was trimmed with
burgundy and autumn-toned flowers. The
guest of honor chose a two-piece beige
suit and an off-the-face hat of brown felt
with brown accessories. The brown fitted
bag and make-up case presented to Joyce
by the Mayor on behalf of Brighton citi-
zens were a happy choice. The guest-of-
honor’s mother and mother-in-law were
present. During the afternoon Joyce
sang ; assisting artists were Etta Bernard
and R. White.
Having been fortunate in obtaining a
home in Toorak, Major George Maxwell,
who is A.D.C. to Sir Winston Dugan, his
wife Peggy, and Penelope Nettlefold (also
a member of the G.H. personal staff)
celebrated the occasion by giving a small
late-afternoon party in the new home.
Both Peggy and Penelope wore
black ensembles. Captain Tommy Tomp-
kins, U.S.A. Naval Attache, came with
Mrs. Tompkins, she in a tailored beige
linen suit; Elizabeth Clarke was in black
with touches of white ; Shirley Watts,
with whom Peggy and George Maxwell
ride in the early morning hours, wore a
ballerina-length frock of brown-and-
white-checked taffeta, Mrs. De Ranatz
(her husband is attached to the Nether-
lands Legation at Canberra) chose a
black ensemble.
The National Theatre was decorated
with large bowls of hydrangeas, zinnias,
dahlias and autumn foliage when the
Knox lady gave an At Home for Clarke
Scholarship winner Valma Lewis, who
leaves shortly for London for a three-
year course at the London College of
Music. The hostess, whose father
founded the scholarship, was dressed in a
black-and-white-patterned frock, a light-
weight black coat and a large white high-
crowned hat. Among many well-known
women at the party were Mrs. Norman
Myer, in a white jersey jumper-blouse,
navy skirt, white jacket *of nautical cot
and small navy beret trimmed with
matching fisher net; Gertrude Johnson,
director of the National Theatre, whose
large black picture hat set off her black-
and-white-patterned frock; Mrs. T. J,
Kiernan, wife of Eire’s Minister, who
wore a Gainsborough hat which featured
white and blue ostrich feathers
with her black outfit; Mrs. Frank Watts,
who highlighted her black ensemble with
a small natural-straw hat trimmed with
black riband and a pink rose. Edith
Harrhy entertained with her songs.
Saul and Ida Aarons—she looking re-
markably young for such an event —cele-
brated their silver-wedding anniversary
with a party at 14 Queen’s-road. The
hostess wore an ice-blue satin gown, the
skirt falling to the floor in graceful folds,
the modified off-the-shoulder bodice em-
bellished with gardenias. With Mrs.
Wallace Mitchell, in a black-lace gown
and wide sash of blue and mauve taffeta,
was son Robert, who with his sister Betty
sails for England next month in the
Orion. Mrs. Mitchell is busy with plans
for the Coral Sea Ball which she is or-
ganising. Mrs. George Haines chose a
candy-striped pink and blue taffeta frock.
Mrs. Bill McDermott’s frock was of
shocking-pink crepe, the skirt falling in
folds from a bustle ; the small matching
jacket was trimmed with tiny amethyst
beads and trails of silver beads.. Mrs.
Norman Spry’s white broderie anglaise
bodice was allied to a white sharkskin
skirt. The bodice was worn over emerald-
green taffeta, making it more striking.
Sophie Graves’s bodice was of deep-wine
crepe, trimmed with matching beads;
what appeared to be a full flowing skirt
was really a hostess gown featuring
wide trousers. Mrs. Arthur Crofts’s white
crepe tunic dinner gown was high-necked
and sequin-trimmed. • Betty O’Connor
favored a pastel-pink quilted satin frock
with shoe-string straps of burgundy velvet
ribbon ; Eileen Hattam was in black net
with gay flowers appliqued on the bodice
with its frill of net and also on the front
of the skirt; Maree Raymond’s white
satin gown was printed in sprays of pink
and mauve flowers.
Here is slim, attractive Joy Youlden,

musical-comedy star who forsook the
footlights to take up broadcasting and
producing. She hasi produced many stage
shows for the University and has covered
everything from revues to Ibsen drama.
Now she has joined the Uni. staff of
drama, which is under the direction of
Associate-Professor Keith Macartney.

Muriel Allen, who was a passenger on
the Orion, and has Been staying with the
L. L. Johnstons at their Toorak home,
came to Australia to keep a promise she
made to hundreds of airmen to come out
and see them and their families when the
war was over. This* Englishwoman, who
served as a transport driver in the
F.A.N.Y.S. in the 1914-18 war, was a
sergeant in the W.A.A.F. in the last one,
and was a grand friend to the men who
were attached to a bomber squadron at
Chipping Warden. In typical Aussie
fashion they christened her “Sergeant
Moo” when she dispensed hospitality in
a barn which was known as “The
Kennels,” and her guests became known
as the “pups.” Already Miss Allen has
met some of them again—several in
Perth and others in Melbourne. She will
go on to Sydney, and expects to spend
18 months travelling round the southern
States, Later Miss Allen intends to go
by horse-drawn caravan to Queensland.
Mention was recently made in this
letter of the work done by Mrs. Earl
Moser in organising the Frankston Junior
Library and Craft Centre. Now the
Centre has moved to its own home since
the Frankston Shire Council made avail-
able a £2OO grant and the use of a build-
ing at Cranbourne-road Reserve. The
new location was opened by Cr. J. L.
Pratt, shire president. It is next door to
the high school and close to the State
school, so the library and craft centre
will be of added value. Miss Celia
Wilkinson is the trained director and she
is assisted by voluntary helpers from the
mother’s auxiliary.
From Sydney
The Show on its opening day last
Saturday reminded of a dress-rehearsal of
a play—there was about it the same air
of really just getting into its stride. A
glance around seemed to prove that the
“props” were all there, but still you felt
something would go wrong. And, of
course, Saturday’s going wrong was the
catering. Prices Commission had fixed
grills with trimmings at 2s. 6d. And any
housewife would have raised the eye-
brow at that, when she added to the
already high cost of food the high cost
of service. So the caterers didn,’t serve
the grills, etc., and so the public munched
salad, or pies, or what have you, and
looked none the worse-tempered for it.
However, by now, that trouble has
been straightened out. This is a grand
Show, women have a hand and voice
in every part of it. The poor old turn-
stiles are churning around totting up
record attendances. The British Empire
display in the Commemorative Pavilion
is full of interest; so is India’s display
of silken goods. Devoted workers for
many charities run tea-rooms at the
Show, and there is a creche where tired
mothers can leave baby in the care of
trained helpers from Day Nurseries and
the Nursery Schools Association while
they do the sights. The Governor of
New South Wales, Lieut.-General North-
cott, went out to the doings on Saturday,
and daughter Marjorie went with him.
Mrs. Tom Kelly, of Box Hill, Minto,
and her horse Esk were in a beam of
limelight. Mrs, Kelly was the winner of
the Equitation test.
If you were a Randwick addict you
just went straight along to the old address
last Saturday, ignoring the Show. This
was the Warwick Farm Autumn meeting,
but the calendar seemed to have got
mixed, for the weather was hot and sunny
as mid-summer. Dressing was light-
.weight and hats were shady. Among the
very smart was Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere.
Her tailored suit was in a small brown-
and-white check design. Her white hat
had the fashionable side drape. Enjoy-
ing Randwick were Mr. and Mrs.
Stewart Taylor, from Johannesburg, who
plan to visit Maoriland next month.
Madame Lorna Sydney, the Westralian
mezzo-soprano, who is now a star of the
Vienna State Opera, arrived in Sydney
last week to give a series of concerts
throughout Australia under A.B.C. direc-
tion. Lorna, who came by Pan-American
clipper, is making her first visit to her
homeland since 1938, when on the advice
of Lotte Lehmann she went to Europe
to study. Her success has been assured
since her brilliant debut in “Carmen”
before a packed opera house in Vienna.
A fortnight ago Lorna was singing in
“Aida” in the Austrian capital, and on
Thursday of next week she will open the
A.B.C.’s celebrity season in Sydney Town
Hall. Lorna is only on leave, between
seasons, from the Vienna Opera House.
She reports that lovely city, one time all
gaiety, to be a pitiable place, its people
deprived of such strengthening foods as
eggs and meat. However, music and the
love of it still flourish, and its people
queue up nightly for the opera.
While the Herefords were ambling into
the Australia last Monday night, the
Aberdeen Angus with stately tread were
entering the Carlton. They both felt
they had rather got one in ahead of the
Shorthorns, who did not have their
dinner-party till Saturday. This year the
Aberdeen Angus fraternity for the first
time allowed wives to accompany their
husbands. Other years only women
allowed at the sacred feast were those
active in the business of cattle-raising.
Mrs. Rupert Wilson, of Oberon, who last
year wrote an entertaining menu for the
dinner, this year wrote a divertissement
—“Aberdeen Angus Recital” —which was
printed opposite the food list. She must
have been exercising her seeress powers
when she wrote the opening number:
“Overture,” by “Binge Gang,” played
by “Trangie Piper.” It was written be-
fore the judges awarded Bingye Gan
the championship ribbon. The Gordo
Munros, the Clifford Minters, the Ruper
Wilsons, Colonel White, the Huttons
Dingo (Q.), the Lyn. Sandersons, Col
Sinclair, Alexander Keith, of the Scottis
Aberdeen A. Society, Mr. Webb, fro
Maoriland, were notables among t
guests.
The Kindergarten Union of this Sta
has just concluded its 52nd year of gooc
work for the small Australian. La
Monday afternoon there was a gre
attendance at the annual meeting. Th
was in the Blue Room of David Jones
George-street store and president of tl
Union, Charles Lloyd Jones, was in tl
chair. Marjorie and Elizabeth Northco
the Governor’s daughters were at th
meeting.

her artistry that, bereft of the movemen

A group of Italian folk songs, beautifull
sung, again proved popular. Her asso

the State in connection with Empire Day

school child might have one.
One of the Greek Consular staff ex
plained last week that when Greece
celebrates her National Day she is
really celebrating the successful revol
long ago when the banner of liberty was
first raised by the Bishop of Patras. Last
week the popular Consul-General for
Greece, Dr. E. C. Vrisakis, and his
wife gave their eighth party in Sydney
commemorating the great day. The
Vrisakis home at Darling Point welcomec
about 200 guests, and “good-byes” were
said to Archbishop Timotheos, who goes
off to the Dodecanese Islands, after be-
ing head of the Greek Orthodox Church
in Australia and Maoriland for 15 years.
The verandahs and gardens of the
Maurice GulsonTiome at Rose Bay were
filled with animated groups of cocktail-
sippers last Thursday evening. Before
the party ended a bright and twinkling
new moon was adding its silver to the
scene. This pre-race cocktail party was
for the benefit of the Institution for the
deaf and dumb and the blind children.
Active on the committee were Mrs. Ted
Scorfield, Mrs. Hans Robertson, Mrs.
Sam McMahon, Mrs. Lewis Treweeke.
Mrs. Gulson, who donated the party,
wore an enviable black crepe dinner
frock.
The most unusual race of the Easter
meeting looks like being the Hobby
Horse Cup at the Easter Race Frivolity
at Rose’s on April 9. A full field has
been nominated, including Shining Night,
Grand Fils, Petulance, Havachat, Coro-
nation Lad, Quizmaster, Alderman, Sweet
Chimes, Mandova and other well known
horses. The committee, under Mrs. C.
T. Lorenz, is working hard for the suc-
cess of this function, which will benefit
the Food for Babies Fund and Good
Samaritan Association. After singing “In
Your Easter Bonnet,” Mrs. lan Jacoby
will present a floral Easter bonnet and
a silver sugar-basin to the lucky pair
holding the right ticket for the posy and
fan with which each lady will be pre-
sented on entering.
One of the reasons for its being, the
Savage Club declares, is O to foster an
appreciation of art, music, literature and
the sciences. As an earnest of this the
club every year presents a scholarship
valued at £5O to a young Australian
studying one of these subjects. A note
from secretary Adrian Ashton tells that
the 1946 award has been won by violinist
Isabelle Mallitt. Isabelle, still in her
teens, is a Junior Legatee. She is a
pupil of Florent Hoogstoel, and the com-
mittee was impressed by her musician-
ship and interpretation. Special awards
of £25 each go to pianist Marian Graham
Smith and tenor Paul Miskell.


BRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIR
LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM, MAY sth-16th. 1947
This is your first opportunity in seven years to
gee your old suppliers in Britain and to meet new ones.
Overseas Buyers are invited to Britain for the
1947 British Industries Fair. It will enable them to
establish personal contact with the makers of the
immense range of United Kingdom goods displayed
in the London (Lighter Industries) and Birmingham
(Hardware & Engineering) Sections of the Fair. The
careful grouping of exhibits will assist buyers to
compare the products of competing firms with a
minimum of time, trouble and expense. Special
arrangements to suit individual markets can be dis-
cussed and terms and conditions of business settled
direct with the manufacturer, since only the actual
producer or the sole selling agent may exhibit.
* For full details of the 1947 Fair apply to the nearest British
Commercial Diplomatic Officer or Consular Officer, or the
British Trade Commissioner in your area.

The trend of banking organisation in
Australia is toward concentration of
business into the hands of larger units,
and has been ever since the bank suspen-
sions and reconstructions brought about
by the financial blizzard of the early
1890’s. Among other things it makes for
added strength and prestige, creates
greater mobility of funds and provides a
more compact service over a wider field.
Seldom does every part of Australia ex-
perience similar seasonal and other con-
ditions at one and the same time. The
large banking organisation can use its
funds in one State or area to assist clients
in another State or area where condi-
tions are less propitious with greater
ease and facility than a much smaller
institution.
Latest and largest of its kind is the
proposed merger of the Bank of Aus-
tralasia and the Union Bank, two sturdy
Anglo-Australian institutions with head-
quarters in London. The ’Asia first set
up here in 1835 and the Union in 1837.
Each co. weathered the big financial
storms of the 1840’s and 1890’s without
mishap, and each has never failed to
make an annual distribution for the last
100 years. Their businesses are well
scattered throughout all the Australian
States and Maoriland, and they are of
approximately equal financial weight.
Firstly shareholders of each bank will
have to sanction the merger—date of
meetings yet to be announced. After
that the Union will exchange its own
scrip for scrip in the ’Asia, on the basis
of one Union share paid to £5 (with a
reserve liability of £10) for one ’Asia
share paid to £5 (with a reserve liability
of £5). Then the ’Asia will replace its
old nameplate with a new one, namely,
Australasia and Union Bank. The Com-
monwealth and Maoriland Governments
have approved the project, and Britain’s
Capital Issues Committee “will give
favorable consideration to the necessary
issue of shares when they learn that the
scheme has been sanctioned by the share-
holders.”
In size the new organisation will rival
the Bank of New South Wales, the first
bank to set up in Australia—it opened
its doors for business at Mrs. Reiby’s
House, Macquarie-place, Sydney, on
April 8, 1817. Capital structures com-
pare as follows:
Paid Capital. Reserves.* Total.
’Asiaf .. £4,600,000 £4,759,660 £9,259,560
Unionf .. 4,000,000 5,025,086 9,025,086
Total .. £8,500,000 £9,784,046 £18,284,646
Wales . . . . 8,780,000 6,498,721 15,278,721
* Includes currency reserve: ’Asia £2,000,000,
Union £1,600,000. t Sterling.
Dividends paid in their last financial year
were ’Asia 81 p.c., Union 81 p.c., Wales
61 p.c. The ’Asia and Union divs. are
subject to English income tax of 9s. in
the £, which makes 81 p.c. worth only
4.67 p.c. net in the hands of shareholders.
But it is paid in sterling, which at the
present rate of exchange makes 4.67 p.c.
worth 5.85 p.c. in Australian currency.
And, under the recent agreement with
Britain on double taxation, Australian
shareholders will be liable to Common-
wealth tax on the dividends, but if they
elect to be assessed on the gross or
nominal amount of such dividend, they
will be entitled to deduct the U.K. tax as
a set-off against the Australian tax. If
they do not so elect, the set-off of the
U.K. tax will not be allowed.
For the 12 months to end Oct., 1946,
the ’Asia netted £223,014, equal to 4.95
p.c. on capital. For the year to end
Aug., 1946, the Union netted £191,590,
equal to 4.78 p.c. on capital. On the
basis of these figures combined pet earn-
ings were £414,604, or 4.87 p.c. on
£8,500,000, which will be the paid capital
of the new Australasian and Union
Bank. The ’Asia and Union have
conservative boards, which have never
overstated the position in the past; in-
deed, each bank is known to have sub-
stantial inner reserves. So shareholders
need have no fears about maintenance of
the nominal 8| p.c. div., for the present
at any rate. The operations of the banks,
however, are now subject to a wide range
of restrictions and controls, and future
earnings will be related to the operation
of these controls. The recent cut in over-
draft rates from 4| p.c. to 4\ p.c. as
from the beginning of 1947 will largely
offset the benefit of any growth in ad-
vances.
Here is a comparison of deposits and
advances of the three institutions as
shown in the latest available official bank-
ing returns:

The new bank will be a very solid con-
cern indeed, and will be well equipped
to substantially extend its lending con-
nections as opportunity offers.

merger. Over the same period the Union’s
shares moved up from £8 13s. 6d. (ceil-
ing) to £l3 10s. The return at £l3 10s.
is 2.1 p.c. in each case on an 81 p.c. div.

The co.’s experience reflects the risks
of the business. It has been squatting
out west in N. S. Wales and over the
border in Queensland for the last 65
years. Drought and an anaemic wool
market left the co. with a capital de-
ficiency of £112,692 in 1930. Shareholders
got back into the picture in 1935, and
have remained there since, except in
1938, when seasons and prices were both
unkind. Over the last 11 years divs. have
averaged 6.6 p.c., and when the books
last closed the whole, of the capital and
£19,302 besides were represented by
things that could be touched with a stick.
During the war the British wool con-
tract stabilised prices, the struggle being
mainly against seasons and mounting
costs. The spring of £15,443 in last term’s
net earnings reflects the rise in the price
of wool and a slightly better clip.
Drought was experienced on all the co.’s
properties on which rainfall in inches
compares as follows:

Average rainfall on Thurulgoona (near
Cunnamulla, Q.) was 12.45 inches over
the last 45 years, on Quantambone (near
Brewarrina, N.S.W.) 14.8 inches over 52
years, and on Tondeburine (near Gular-
gambone, N.S.W.) 18.81 inches over
25 years.

end of 1946, an extra 14,769 passed over
the shearing-board:

The lift in wool prices was responsible
for most of the leap of £36,172 in gross
earnings from all sources (£94,011). In-
cluding an extra £15,443 for taxation
(£23,709), £4006 (down £449) for depre-
ciation and the new wool contributory
charge (£3351), exes. (£69,099) took
£20,944 of the gain. That left the net
result £15,228 stronger at £24,912, or
10.2 p.c. on capital as against 3.9, 6,
10.4, 10.1, 6.9, 9.8 and 1.2 p.c. back to
1939. The div. was lifted from 3.3 p.c.
to 6.6 p.c., making the average over the
last 11 years 6.6 p.c.
As for the current term, good rains re-
cently fell on all the co.’s properties,
assuring the seasonal outlook for months
ahead. In September last 41,100 acres
from Quantambone, held under Govern-
ment lease, were allotted to settlers, and
2082 acres freeholds from Tondeburine
were sold to returned servicemen. The
Government is now considering taking
over the rest of Tondeburine (freehold)
for closer settlement, and the co. is con-
sidering purchase of another property, de-
tails of which have not been broadcast.
However, with wool at its present price
—average is about 48 p.c. above previous
season’s appraisement figure —better than
last year’s profit is in sight.
Finances are healthy:

Edments, Ltd.
A proposed new issue of £25,000 by
Edments, Ltd., chain-store proprietors,
will bring total paid capital in this
eleventh year of the co.’s existence to a
figure more than six times the original
amount of £35,000. Within two years of
its registration shareholders received a
first dividend of 10 p.c., and that rate
has been maintained ever since, with the
addition of a 2\ p.c. Victory bonus in
1946. Business began in leased properties
at Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart and
Geelong ; now the co. owns freeholds in
every capital city, the most recent pur-
chase being a property in King-street,
Sydney.
As the following table shows, these re-
sults are due, in part, to the directors’
sanguine policy in regard to- distri-
butions of profit; and it should be re-
membered that so far the co. has lived en-
tirely in times of comparative general
prosperity:

$50,000 down and the balance from half
profits won. The mine has a “sub-
stantial” tonnage of developed ore, and
is equipped with a modern concentrating
mill. Production is scheduled to begin
in May. Bulolo, in which Placer holds
150,000 $5 shares, recently started up
some of its dredges again. When it gets
going, much is expected of Placer’s new

£72,500 in 10s. shares) is offered those
on the register at March 19 55,000 new
ss. ords. at par, 38 for 100. Also nominal
capital is to be increased to £250,000 by
creation of 300,000 new 10s. shares for
possible future issue. For the year to
June 30 last the co. netted £19,731, equal
to 27.2 p.c., and paid Is. a share, or 10 p.c.
An interim 6d. a share, half of it tax
free, is to be sent out. on April 1. Lack
of shipping space has recently stood in
the way of overseas deliveries. It is
hoped to double production before the
end of 1947. The co. treats beach sands
at Byron Bay (N.S.W.) for zircon and
rutile. Concentration by jigging is the
first stage of treatment, and sometimes
is the only concentrate produced. The
product is mostly sold in U.S.A. as a
mixed heavy mineral concentrate, usually
of not less than 98 p.c. pure mineral.
Zirconium metal and its derivatives are
now used mainly in the electrical and
ceramic industries.

Encouraging developments are re-
ported from Ora Banda Amalgamated,
Grant’s Patch (W.A.). At No. 7 level on
Mackenzie’s lease exploratory driving re-
cently disclosed 50ft. of ore, average
width over 20ft., from which 177 tons
assayed 6.3dwt. a ton. In following
leaders from this lode, a new make oV
ore was disclosed, assaying 16dwt. over
a width of 36 inches. The results of
driving on this new make have not yet
been broadcast. Interest in this develop-
ment is increased by disclosure of a
quartz ore-body on No. 6 level, assaying
25dwt. in the face over a width of 48
inches. For the fortnight ended March 1
138 tons oxides, averaging 12.1dwt., and
324 tons sulphides, averaging 5.7dwt.,
were raised from Nicholson’s shaft.

Knowledge is of two kinds, we either have it ourselves or we
know where to find it from others. Samuel Johnson.
A shrewd analysis from the lips of
the immortal Doctor-—true enough
in the calm of pre-industrial England
and of greater significance in these
days of specialised knowledge.
We at Babcock are specialists in our
knowledge of thermal engineering.
Our beginnings were rooted in the
pioneering days of the simple hand-
fed, low temperature and pressure
boiler. In the passing decades, our
engineers followed the path of world
industrial expansion, studied the
behaviour of fqyeign fuels, climates
and operating conditions, installed
Babcock boilers throughout the
world and, supported by the research
of chemists, metallurgists and en-
gineers in Babcock laboratories,
amassed the knowledge which en-

SUNDRY SHOWS
CIRCUS.
In a small, tent beside the main erec-
tion of Wirth’s Circus in Sydney it is
possible, for the moderate fee of six-
pence, to inspect a bull which weighs a
ton and has five legs. Ignoring any puns
on the subject, it is possible in the main
tent for a slightly larger fee to see even
more remarkable things which Mr. Phil
Wirth has brought to town. Without even
the bribe of a peanut five performing ele-
phants, under the guidance of Mr,
Frederick Schafer, dance an Irish jig as
well as a kind of “Swan Lake” ballet, sit
down tiredly when seemingly in need of
rest, walk and turn on a tightrope with
simian agility, and even form a human
or rather elephant, bridge while one
ponderous member of the act goes down
on its knees to crawl and wriggle under-
neath.
The “celebrated Winskills” ride bi-
cycles and monocycles, including one
that is little more than a ballbearing with
gears, and even a wheelless contraption
as yet unidentified by the Malvern Star
people or any other makers of veloci-
pedes. Their dog, Barko, ascends a
stairway on his hind legs, descends it on
his front members, counts, rides a scooter
and performs other stunts which would
be uncanny in any canine.
“Valento” juggles balls, bricks and
tennis racquets with His hands, feet and
mouth and in several different positions;
“La Frankie” gives a solitary aerial per-
formance, and, if the audience forgets to
applaud as much as it should, it also for-
gets to eat its ice-cream and peanuts
while gazing at her acrobatics as she
hangs and twists within a few feet of
the tops of the king poles, apparently
trusting her neck to a couple of ropes,
her own agility and an exceedingly
benevolent providence.
lan Westbrook shatters the evening by
cracking stockwhips up to 50 feet long,
and also guides the high-school horse as
it minces, waltzes, bows and performs as
though it would willingly dance a minuet
if permitted; the Flying Waynes toss
themselves from the trapezes with that
always amazing sureness and accuracy,
and then do the same again blindfolded
to prove jt.
There are some changes in the circus,
but nothing vital is missing—the French
clowns have gone, but Australians have
replaced them, and Mick and Edna Lane
and Jackie Wislang have an uproarious
time with a lump of dough,, some cook-
ing instructions and some boxing lessons.
The lion-taming act is on the ice while
Madame Kovar recovers from the attack
of one of her charges, but the band is
back —and what a difference it makes —
there are performing cockatoos; the
Myrons, “defying gravity while rotating
on a rolling cylinder” ; Miss Joy Falkiner,
whose “bending beauty and delightful
grace and artistry never fail to appeal” ;
the Walhallahs, “in unbelievable feats of
whirlwind acrobatics”; and there are
peanuts, ice-cream and the smell of saw-
dust and elephants, and through it all the
lively chatter and applause of an audience
enjoying itself immensely.
"Peter Grimes."
Messrs. Verdi, Puccini, Gounod, Doni-
zetti and Co. based their operas on the
quaint notion .that these works should
have woven through them arias which
would haunt the ear with their beauty,
overtures and intermezzi which would
impel those who heard to whistle them.
When they fashioned concerted numbers
such as the trio from the fifth act of
“Faust,” the quartet from “Rigoletto”
and the sextet from “Lucia,” they aimed
to combine harmonic perfection with
dramatic effect.
.How pitiable were their old-fashioned
efforts compared with those of the mod-
ernist musical giants has been ably
demonstrated by Benjamin Britten in his
“Peter Grimes,” which was given its
Australian premiere in concert version
by the A.B.C. and has been put over the
air.
Benjamin would possibly scorn the
idea that anyone would want to whistle
anything from his “opera.” They
wouldn’t. Not that they couldn’t—in
one instance, anyway. This is a recitative
early in the piece allotted to the title
role —for about 25 notes it is sung on
the one note. This makes it easy on the
singer and even easier on the composer.
It is the most harmonious number
throughout the work.
In his concerted numbers Benjamin has
ideas that don’t exactly square with those
of the old masters, either. In one case
he has 10 soloists beefing it out at once,
double fortissimo, in competition not
only with an orchestra seemingly engaged
in a tympani v. The Rest match, but
also with the chorus going full blast. If
some cow-cocky down near Ulladulla was
puzzled by the sound of distant thunder
on a late clear, starry night, he’ll know
what it was.
The plot, which derives from portion
of Crabbe’s poem “The Borough,” is
good “theatre,” though it is frankly
bellowdrama of the kind which gave such
fruity material for Stephen Leacock’s
Nonsense Novels. The soloists generally
made the best of the patchwork material
allotted them. Honors in enunciation,
so vitally necessary in a work in which
the words are the only things that count,
went easily to Raymond Beatty and
Stanley Clarkson.
The “opera”—or more correctly the
ordeal —was under the conductorship of
John Farnsworth Hall.
"A Stolen Life."
Now coming thick and fast from
Hollywood, the film? featuring identical
twins must be doing terrible things to
the liquor trade. However, even seeing
double can be pleasant when the con-
founder of one’s optics is Bette Davis.
In “A Stolen Life” (Sydney Century)
she has the difficult task of playing the
parts of twin sisters, as alike as book-
ends, and packing as vast a collection
of different ideals and principles between
them. Bette Davis’s acting throughout is
a classic portrayal of good and evil.
When the viper of the pair loses need for
shoes by drowning, her dove-like sister
tries to step into them, and finds spiritu-
ally that she is far too big for them.
By no means a raving beauty, Bette
Davis has managed over the past few
years to. gather a pleasing array of
Academy Award “Oscars” on her mantel-
piece, and after her performance in “A
Stolen Life” she may have to dump her
clock elsewhere to make more space.
Sharing the acting honors in her current
film is Walter Brennan, in par form as a
slightly sweeter lemon than he usually is.
Also in the blue-ribbon class is Glenn
Ford, who marries one of the Miss
Davises, but becomes increasingly be-
wildered as to which. Enlightened by
cries of “That’s her, ya mug” from the
Century’s lounge, he found her in the
end, clinched, and concluded an excel-
lent film.
Reviewed Briefly.
Stage and Concert
“Aida”: The A.B.C. put Verdi’s gigan-
tic melodrama —generally the traditional
curtain-raiser to a grand-opera season —at
the tail of its operas-without-action in
Melbourne. It also shifted operations
from the Assembly Hall to the
Town Hall, thus requiring conductor
Joseph Post to fill the larger audi-
torium with choral and orchestral uproar
and at the same time give soloists a fair
innings. They were occasionally
threatened with inundation, but, gener-
ally, it was a magnificent performance.
Even in their party dresses and boiled
shirts Sylvia Fisher, William Herbert,
Frederick Collier and Wilma Whitney
were impressive. The heady Verdian
draught was given a full body by the Mel-
bourne Philharmonics.
* * * *
“The Magic Flute!’: Weiland’s libretto
may be whimsical, mystical, nonsensical
and at times banal, but for delicate
beauty Mozart’s music in this is unsur-
passed in the whole range of opera. The
A.B.C.’s concert version with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra and chorus under
John Farnsworth Hall was an immediate
success. Joyce Atkinson projected her-
self into the front rank of Australian
sopranos, and Stanley Clarkson’s singing
was equalled only in artistry by William
Herbert’s. Renee Goossens, Mollie
Grouse, Lily Kolos, Alan Light, Edna
Todd, Phyllis Gillet and others contri-
buted to the success with sound inter-
pretative notions and fine voices.
* * * *
It was a pity the Sydney Theatre Guild
only had a season of three nights at the
Independent Theatre with Ferenc Mol-
nar’s “The Play’s the Thing.” It was
glittering entertainment, splendidly pro-
duced and acted. The entire cast —F.
Stewart Jarbo, Sidney Chambers, Alan
Poolman, Thelma Grigg, Adrian Bor-
zell, Charles W. Fisher and Denys
Burrows—left nothing to be desired.
Artbursts
The prints have gone from the main
court of the N.S.W. National Art Gallery,
being replaced by Australian pictures. In
one of the side courts there is a compre-
hensive exhibition of Max Meldrum’s
work with interesting comments by Mel-
drum. With some exceptions the artist
seems to be unnecessarily hard on his
early work. “Brittany Farm” is dated
1907, and Meldrum implies that his work
around this period is inferior to his later
and more typical paintings. But the
picture, a landscape, is lovely, with a
shadowed laneway and old, cold buildings.

showing, Fred Jessup has a slight and
lighthearted slum scene which, because
of its vitality and its light, is much more
faithful. Some of the rejects are extra-
ordinary ; but the public has not
suffered any great hurt by the action of
the trustees in culling them. Among
others, a portrait of J. L. Geraghty,
M.L.A., wreathed in smoke and with
a glass of beer in his hand, catches the
eye.

“Brief Encounter” (Sydney Esquire):
Some Noel Coward slightness with little
of his relieving brightness. The substance
concerns an unrequited love affair in
which an average suburban home is
shaken when the wife falls in love with a
doctor. Celia Johnson makes a quiet and
faithful portrayal of the uninteresting
wife, Trevor Howard does the same as
the uninteresting doctor, and there is a
thin vein of realism running through the
story. But realism alone isn’t entertain-
ing.

“A Perfect Marriage” (Sydney Prince
Edward): David Niven was meant for
better things than this matrimonial
Donnybrook which belies its title. It is
quite understandable that after being
married for ten years to Loretta Young
he should commence hurling mud instead
of the usual bouquets, for on Loretta’s
acting it must have been an exceptionally
dull decade.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
REP MILL RUM.
An attendance of 37,250 at Randwick on
Saturday was considered disappointing, the first
Royal Show for six years proving a greater
counter-attraction than had been anticipated.
For the first time the camera was in operation
and had plenty of use, first horse to win a
photo.-finish on the course being The Groom
(E. Fordyce) in the first division of the six-
furlongs two-year-old event which opened the
programme. The Groom showed great gameness
in stalling off the promising Brueghel filly
Shading under a disadvantage of 81b.; con-
sistent Cherson third. There was no need
for the camera in the second division, in which
Keewatin (W. Briscoe) clearly downed Valiant
Crown and Set Purpose.
Against those who maintain that two-year-old
form is hard to follow and that juvenile events
are traps for young punters, The Groom and
Keewatin were favorite and equal favorite for
their respective races and were the only favorites
to win on a day when older horses produced
some rather startling reversals of form.
When weights were first issued for the autumn
double this page chose Blue Legend and Rain-
bird as an early pick. Both had a run at
Randwick and their efforts gave no cause to
alter the selection. With topweight of 9st.,
Blue Legend tackled the seven-furlongs Liver-
pool Handicap, the result of which entitled
handicapper Wilson to a pat on the back.
Showing a vast improvement on his effort at
Rosehill the previous week, Native , Son (D.
Munro) led throughout, but a regular wall of
horses was descending on him at the finish.
Coming with the brilliant late run which is his
style, Blue Legend finished only sixth, but at
that was a bare length behind the winner.
Sandwiched in between in this thrilling finish
were Dutchman, Vermeil, Hiraji and Crusader.
For the Doncaster Blue Legend drops to
8.11, at which he is the best-handicapped horse
in the field. He has shown that he is ready
to do his best and the extra furlong of the
Doncaster will better suit his finishing style.
Hardest for him to beat should be the capable
and consistent Columnist, who has the rough
end of the handicapping with 9st. Weight may
be the fly in the ointment also with St. Fairy,
who has 9.7, but he’s a fine galloper and may
take a hand in the finish- Tamaroa’s recent
excellent form speaks for itself, and others
entitled to consideration are Prince Consort,
Dutchman, Native Son and Hiraji.
The camera was called in to decide the
Warwick Autumn Handicap of 12 furlongs, in
which Rainbird accounted for Darnley and
Courier. For those who may have specked
Rainbird for the second leg of the double it
was a most pleasing sight. It would have been
quite satisfactory had she merely run a place
or a decent race at her first start after com-
pleting the tiring trip from Adelaide. But
she won it and should improve further. For
the Cup she will drop 41b., going down to 8.5.
As a Melbourne Cup winner she is favorably
handicapped, and is certainly as well qualified
as anything else to see out the two miles.
Sydney racegoers possibly saw the last of
Flight in the 10-furlongs Chipping Norton
Stakes. Vigaro jumped out at the start and
tried to steal the race. O’Sullivan sooled Flight
along, passed Vigaro at the back of the course
and at the six-furlongs had a six-lengths lead,
setting a killing pace for a 10-furlongs race. Still
that far in front with three-and-a-haif to go the
Flight of old would have won the race at a
walk, but she simply folded up approaching tire
turn. Sweet Chime ran past her and put up
a game show, but was in turn beaten by
Vigaro (W. Briscoe), revealing a distinct con-
trast to his recent form. The New Zealander
Golden Souvenir was an improved third, fol-
lowed by Monogram, Flight and, last, the
Victorian filly Amelia.
Since he represents a light-betting stable,
Smooth Action is probably paying his way
by filling minor places, but only stiff luck has
kept him off the winning list. In the 10-furlongs
Cobbitty Handicap his rider, D. Munro, didn’t
sight an opening till they’d passed the distance,
whereafter Smooth Action finished strongly to
fill second place behind Paktong (G. Moore)
and ahead of Merry John. Paktong is a stable-
mate of Puffham and looks like doing as well
as the Lackham gelding in the right company.
Winding up the day Loyal March (G. Moore)
accounted for Debenture and Crispian in the
Welter.
* * * *
Caulfield on Saturday saw a continuation of
the protests and hairline finishes which have
been features of recent Melbourne racing.
There were two protests, both dismissed, and
four finishes which, but for the camera, might
have added to the string of deadbeats recorded
of late. The absolute maximum of suspense
is inflicted on punters when, as happened twice
on Saturday, a protest has to be decided on top
of a photo.-finish.
Incredibly, in view of the number of times
she has let backers down, Cherie Marie was
made favorite for the St. Kilda Handicap and
after having every chance again failed. Coming
round the turn she was presented with an
opening on the rails through which she could
have driven in a float. Badger took her
through to hit the front, but was tackled and
beaten by Glamis Star and Promise You, who
went over the line locked together. Glamis
Star (W. Richards) survived camera and protest.
It was the same story but with a more happy
ending in the Gordon Steeple, in which the
favorite, Wangaratta (R. Hall), was still ad-
judged to be the winner after the camera and
C. Morley, rider of runner-up Cimranda, had
had their say. A good effort on the part of
Wangaratta, who has scored at his only two
tries over the fences. The race was run in
a sharp shower, yet Wangaratta’s time was
only three-quarters of a second outside the
course record. Old Tente ran his usual honest
race to be third in another photo.-finish.
Doubles bookmakers operating on the two
jumping events didn’t have their usual success.
Earlier the Narong Hurdle went to the favorite,
Ruthless (G. Sholl). He ran a sound race,
jumping cleanly and proving much too good
for a bunch of moderates, the next best of whom
were gatio and Sun Eagle. A four-year-old
son of Roxborough, Ruthless was not raced
until early this year. He has had six runs, all
over the jumps, and been only twice out of a
place.
Favorite for the Orrong Two-year-old, Ment-
more, a son of High Caste and Miss Alienor,
did very well to win from number 21 alley at
the six-furlongs barrier. Ridden by A. Breasley,
Mentmore came into the picture as they rounded
the bend and finished a shade too well for
Fiorello, though the judge had to leave it to
the camera. A particularly handsome Dhoti
colt, Lungi, was third, making a good impres-
sion at his first public appearance.
Apprentice W. A. Smith gained a 51b. allow-
ance for the strongly-fancied Nestor in the
South Yarra Handicap, but trying to go round
“ Dive, Joe — he's got a bead on you!"
the leader, Hispano, on the turn, instead of
sticking to the rails, may have cost the race.
Hispano went wide, carrying Nestor with him,
and St. Razzle slipped through on the rails
to win the photo.-finish.
Bookies should have salvaged enough for
their fare home when Tilston, at 50 to 1, very
easily accounted for Noble Prince and Knockar-
low in the Welter. F. W. Hughes must need
an elaborate filing system to keep track of his
innumerable gallopers. On Saturday he won
with Tilston in Melbourne and Tithonus in
Newcastle, while his colors were seen in five
of the seven races at Randwick.

M.C.C.’s journey’s end:
In an endeavor to get finality, a fourth day
was added for the MX. v. M.C.C. Test at
Christchurch, but rain won the argument and
the washout ended with MX. 345 for nine
wickets .(closed) and M.C.C, 265 for seven
wickets.
Hammond top-scored for England with 79 in
no doubt the last match he was playing against
MX. He has had 11 innings in Tests v. MX.
for 1015 runs, av. 112.77. His two innings in
1933 —227 at Christchurch and 336 not out at
Auckland —gave him the remarkable average
for that season of 563.
M.C.C. packed away cricket gear on Satur-
day after defeating Auckland by an innings
and 65 runs—M.C.C., 240; Auckland, 85 and
90. Compton’s farewell effort was 97 not
out and 11 wickets for 49 runs. In four
matches in MX. Compton added 228 runs to
lift his batting aggregate in all matches to
2066, av. 54.36 —the highest by an English
player on an Australasian tour, the next-best
being Hammond’s 1641, av. 91.11, in 1922-23.-
Also, Compton’s 38 innings are the most since
W. Read had 39 knocks in 1887-88.
Smith (66) and Wright (65), who have carried
the bowling burden, Bedser (47) and Pollard
(40) were the chief M.C.C. wicket-gatherers on
the tour.
The tourists played 29 matches, of which
five were won —three of them not first-class;
the others against Victoria (Sheffield Shield
winners) and Auckland —three lost (all Tests)
and 21 drawn. The abnormal tally of undecided
matches suggests an qverhaul of tour arrange-
ments; fewer matches, with four days’ range,
would give more interest. The matches equalled
thos6 of Arthur Shrewsbury’s XI in 1886-87;
close up is the 27 of W. G. Grace’s side in
1891-92 —the band organised by Lord Sheffield,
who, to express pleasure with the visit, pre-
sented the Shield which is now the trophy for
inter-State cricket.
With only one defeat, Western Suburbs had
an easy win in both the Sydney club cricket
championship and grade premiership. Wests
previously landed the “double” in 1928-29.
Tfie selectors didn’t ask any of the successful
team to put on the pads for rep. cricket this
season.

Riverview has been off the winning list
at Sydney G.P.S. regattas for many
years, but everyone associated with the
sport would be pleased to see the school
turn up this year. It deserves a win for
fine work done for rowing in general.
The Riverview Gold Cup regatta on
Saturday was, as it always is, a model
of efficient management. For the second
time in succession Haberfield took the
Cup, winning the heat comfortably, but
extended to beat Shore in the final. The
G.P.S. regatta is to be rowed on the
Nepean on April 12. The unusually
early date caught some crews napping,
and all-round standard seems below past
years. Shore and Newington appear to
be doing best, and High scored in a club
regatta recently.
* * * *
Rowed in heavy rain after crews’ train-
ing had been interrupted by everything
from blizzards to ice-bound rivers, the
Boat Race was won by Cambridge. They
led from start to finish in very slow time
—23 min. 1 sec.

S.A. has surprised itself by naming a
woman in its best polo four for the State.
Miss Mary Teesdale Smith was in the side
which lately won the Bakewell trophy,
and is a lightweight, riding at a little over
7st. Her father, Paul Teesdale Smith, is
an Adelaide lawyer, and was a prominent
player not long ago ; he is now an um-
pire, after having been secretary of the
S.A. Polo Association.

April 20 will be N.S.W. Athletic As-
sociation’s diamond jubilee. Chief Jus-
tice Frederick Darley was the first presi-
dent, then R. Butcher and S’ Henry
Parkes. Afterwards Richard Coombes
looked like being there for ever; he was
president from 1893 until his death in
1935.

The Leichhardt bellman should have
been crying “O yeah, O yeah, a foul
night and all’s hell!” First Tommy Col-
teaux (12.3), who must have trained in
one. of thqse “underground” brigades for
his scrap with Doug Brown (12.6), planted
’em below the belt so accurately that
ref. Art Mawson eventually got tired of
telling him and disqualified him. That
wasn’t the end of the fray—they fought
on for a while harder than ever —but
it may have been an end to Colteaux
at Leichhardt, the management in effect
hissing “He’ll never darken our doors
again!” Also, Harry Stone’s Queens-
land lightweight Art Denham (9.7) beat
Bert Roach (9.9) by the foul route in
the supporting 12-rounder. Roach’s line
was too-accurate headwork. Anyway,
Denham always looked the winner.
* * * *
The scrap between Dave Sands (11.31)
and American Art Lind (11.33) at Sydney
Stadium was as much a washout as the
Patrick-Marcus affair. Lind was com-
pletely outclassed, and after he’d hit the
canvas a number of times ref. Wallis
gave it to Sands on a t.k.o. in the seventh
round. The butting was the envy of
every billygoat from Sydney Show to
Townsville.

Hailing from Queensland, Mickey Hill
(8.2-1) put up a clinking show in out-
pointing Mickey Carr (8.53) at Mel-

all the way; a dandy little fighter.

The Noble Art has been made to look
more artistic than noble in M.L. Court
proceedings over the ring meetings of
American cullud scrapper Willie Jones
and Bos Murphy, pride of the Dominion.
Alleging that Willie had told its secre-
tary the scraps were fixed at friendly
meetings of scrappers and trainers be-
forehand, the Boxing Council was given
the judicial O.K. for revoking Willie’s
license. Willie, the council alleged, spilt
the beans on a prior agreement that the
first engagement was to end —as it in fact
did end—with Bos landing one after the
bell closed the fifth round. The council
is seeking a similar ruling on its power
to out Bos.

Another Bank Merger
The proposed merger of the Queens-
land National Bank with the National
Bank of Australasia is a step in the right
direction. It is in keeping wijth the
modern trend in banking, which is to-
ward concentration of business mto the
hands of larger units. This benefits the
community by making for increased
financial strength, greater mobility of
funds and broader and better service to
a wider public. The merger should also
advantage both shareholders and staff in
each institution, especially the Q.N.
The merger has been approved by the
Federal Treasurer and Commonwealth
Bank, and is subject to acceptance by 75
p.c. of the Q.N.’s shareholders before end
May. The basis of the deal is that the
National will exchange five of its own
f.-p. £1 shares for each f.-p. £5 share in
the Q.N. The National has £5,000,000
of capital supported and assisted by
£3,460,957 of visible reserves, making
total shareholders’ funds £8,460,957, or
335. lOd. per pound of paid capital. Last
year the co. netted £354,563, equal to a
shade over 7 p.c. on capital, and paid a
6 p.c. div. Its present £5-paid shares
recently fetched £8 in the market. The
Q.N.’s £1,750,000 of capital is backed by
£884,806 of visible reserves, making total
shareholders’ funds £2,634,806, or 30s.
Id. per pound of paid capital. It netted
£91,681, or 5.2 p.c. on capital last year,
and paid 5 p.c. Before announcement of
the proposed merger, its f.-p. £5 shares
were at £6 11s. 6d. on the market.
Combined net earnings of the two cos.
was thus £446,244, or 6.6 p.c. on their
combined paid capital; and it can be
taken for granted that net earnings have
been conservatively stated in each case.
So maintenance of the 6 p.c. div. is not
threatened. By sanctioning the merger,
Q.N. shareholders can see a 20 p.c. in-
crease in dividend income, as well as
stronger net tangible backing and a sub-
stantial gain in the market value of their
investment. Those unable to convert for
legal or other reasons are to be paid
cash at £8 per Q.N. £5 share.
Here are balance-sheet figures of each
bank at last balancing date, together with
combined totals:
National. Q-N. Total.
Paid Capital £5,000,000 £1,750,000 £6,750,000
Reserves* .. 3,460,957' 884,806 4,345,763
Interminable
Stock .. 3,014,643 3,014,643
Notes .. 47,507 47,507
Deposits, etc. 88,483,684 22,039,480 110,523,164

Premises .. 1,658,024 567,365 2,225,389
Other assets 83,694 83,694
* After payment final div.
The Q.N.’s 34 p.c. interminable deposit
stock —a reminder of the 1890’s —will be
“ Mummie, try screaming until he gives it to you”
taken over by the National. Combined
net earnings, plus interest on this stock,
is equal to 3.9 p.c. on total shareholders'
funds, plus capital value of the stock in
the books. So on average the stock is
more than earning its keep. Of the
total figures, liquids are equal to 73.6 p.c.
of deposits, and advances only 37.3 p.c.
of deposits. The enlarged bank will,
therefore, be exceptionally well equipped
to further assist trade and industry as
opportunity offers. Before the merger
the National is to subdivide its present
f.-p. £lO shares into 10 shares f.-p. to £1
each, and its £8 shares paid to £5 into
eight shares of £1 paid to 12s. 6d. each.
The National first opened its doors at
Melbourne in 1858. It was not until 1918
that its progress became marked. Over
the next decade paid capital advanced
from £2,000,000 to £5,000,000 by six
share issues, which brought with them
£948,832 of share premiums. During the
same period the Colonial Bank (paid capi-
tal £439,280) and Bank of Queensland
(paid capital £450,000), itself an amalga-
mation of the Bank of North Queensland
and the Royal Bank of Queensland, were
welded into the organisation. Today the
National is third in size among the big
Australian trading banks, and is one of
the most energetic and enterprising of
their number. It has 410 branches and
agencies scattered throughout all the
Australian States—sB of them in Queens-
land —with an office in London. The
Q.N., which commenced business at Bris-
bane in 1872, has never moved far outside
its home State, where it does about 90
p.c, of its business. At present there are
22 towns in Queensland where both
banks: operate.
Two of the Q.N.’s five directors are to
join the board of the National, and the
other three are to join the National’s
Queensland board of advice. The whole
of the Q.N. staff is to be taken over, ex-
cept general manager D. S. Forbes, who
will be paid an “adequate retiring allow-
ance” by the Q.N. He will be long re-
membered in banking and commercial
circles in Queensland for the good work
he has done.
Tax “Concessions”
In addition to previously announced
cuts in income tax totalling £33,000,000
and in sales tax totalling £8,000,000, the
Federal Treasurer has announced further
miscellaneous but welcome “concessions”
amounting to £1,000,000, which will help
to partly iron out some of the more glar-
ing inequities long overdue for correc-
tion. The rebate for a dependent wife is
now to be calculated on £l5O instead of
£100; but the maximum rebate remains
at £45, an arbitrary figure. For depend-
ent children maximum rebate remains
at £45 for the first, but has been lifted
from £8 to £l5 for the second and after.
This is a cheeseparing “concession” to
citizens deserving of better treatment.
The “concessions” to the mining industry
are both overdue and inadequate. Allow-
ance of expenditure on prospecting and
development as a deduction from income
only puts Australia in line with English
practice. More is needed to revive and
liven the industry. This could be done
by abolition of the special gold tax, which
has made 4dwt. gold-bearing ore marginal
grade. There are welcome signs of a
bit better treatment for primary pro-
ducers, whose gamble with nature makes
net earnings essentially a question of
averages. Provision is now made for
spreading losses over seven instead of
four years, and for allowing expenditure
connected with soil erosion, dam con-
struction, irrigation, etc., as a deduction
from income.
Owing to the buoyant state of Federal
revenue and the Treasury’s inaccurate
budgeting, Mr. Chifley’s “concessions”
amount to little, if anything, more than
handing back to the people money he
never expected to receive. There is no
evidence of any economy in the cost of
government. The Treasury is pocketing
the unexpected rake-off to June 30, be-
cause the tax “concessions” do not oper-
ate until July next. For the year to end
June s 1946, total tax collections (Federal
and State combined) amounted to £5l
per head of population as against
£l7 19s. 9d. seven years earlier. And the
country has Mr. Chifley’s suave assur-
ance that Commonwealth expenditure is
unlikely to fall below £4OO million a
year, compared with about £B5 million a
decade ago. It is a high price to pay for
the new “freedom” to do as we are
told.
Two. reforms urgently required but still
officially ignored are reduction in co. taxa-
tion and abolition of the iniquitous
double taxation of dividends, from which
the Treasury takes a slice in the hands of
the co. and again in the hands of share-
holders. Co. taxes, including super tax,
war-time (co.) tax and undistributed-
profits tax, accounted for 57.4 p.c. of all
income tax collected in 1944-45.
Angling keenly for Maoriland trade,
France sees alluring opportunities as
Britain cannot cope with orders. Motor
cars, machinery, tools, electrical apparatus
and other outputs of French factories are
being offered in place of pre-war luxury
and semi-luxury goods now debarred
from the Dominion market. Apostle of
the new policy is M. P. Burthe Mique,
French Trade Commissioner, who has
been telling Maoriland businessmen that
France is entitled to a better deal in re-
turn for heavy purchases of wool and
hides —nearly £3,000,000 in value last
year. His best hope is that Maori-
land will turn to France for goods un-
obtainable from Britain in these days of
heavy demand. France, he says, offers a
better alternative than U.S.A., because
it’s in the sterling area. Chief obstacles
are the tariff and import quotas, and he
is banking on a reduction in the 20 per
cent. Empire preference margin, which is
a headache for foreign firms when they
try to compete. He doesn’t think Empire
preference is doomed, but he expects it
to take a few knocks. France has served
Maoriland with requests for modified
duties, to be discussed at the Geneva
talks, and Maoriland has countered with
demands for reciprocal concessions.
Import quotas will be similarly the sub-
ject of claims and counter-claims.
Negotiations for a commercial treaty be-
tween France and Maoriland are likely
to follow the international parleys.

Imagine, if you can, a metal surface so smooth
that irregularities can only be measured in mil-
lionths of an inch . . . defying discovery by all
but the most powerful compound microscopes!
Superfinish—this revolutionary new metal finish-
ing process—permits closer tolerances, reduces
initial wear, shortens the running-in period and
keeps performance quiet and smooth for many
thousands of miles. And Superfinish is standard
practice in every car of the Chrysler Dodge line—
Chrysler, Dodge, De Soto and Plymouth, and in
Dodge and Fargo trucks and utilities too.

St. George and the Dollar
It is said that the late Lord Keynes
protested sharply when he returned from
negotiating the American loan last year
and learned of new commitments Britain
had made. These included credits to
Greece, exchange moratoriums for
France, Belgium and Denmark and
assistance to Germans in the British zone.
To Keynes they were “Foreign Office
frivolities” that would fritter away too
many dollars—“grandiose ideas that we
cannot afford to put into operation.”
Though the economic aspect constitutes
only a part of diplomatic problems, it
deserved to be stated; and now the
British Government has been forced by
the problem of the balance of payments
to uphold Keynes’s protest.
Since 1939 Britain has not had to facd
this issue of balancing her accounts with
the outside world. She has lived by sell-
ing her overseas investments, by Lend-
Lease, by the method of frozen sterling
balances and lastly by the U.S. and
Canadian dollar loans. Since there will
be no other expedient to follow the dollar
loans it is necessary to estimate how
long those credits will last, and to
what degree Britain will have rehabili-
tated herself in that time. That it is
necessary to make such calculations,
rather than refer simply to conditions
before 1939, is due to the heavy war-time
sacrifice in British property and treasure.
Two-thirds of the pre-war income from
overseas investments has been foregone ;
over a quarter of the former shipping
tonnage is lost; disinvestments and
enemy destruction of property, including
industrial plants, amount to a quarter
of the estimated national wealth in 1939.
According to the recent White Paper,
some £950,000,000 (sterling) of the dollar
credits remained at the . beginning of
1947. The Paper’s estimate of Britain’s
overall adverse balance for 1947 is £350
million, subject to several qualifications
to be mentioned shortly. The following
table shows how this amount was
arrived at, with corresponding figures
for 1946 and for a representative pre-
war period. It reflects the rise in prices
since 1939, and shows how serious has
been the drop in receipts from invisibles
(interest and freights);
• £ Millions

Invisibles (net) .. 352 50 75
Total credits .. 848 950 1275
Adverse balance .. 43 450 350
But this £350 million is not the whole
story. The first difficulty is that the
drain on her dollar credits is not limited
to Britain’s own net adverse balance.
This is the “dilemma” referred to re-
cently by Sir Stafford Cripps: that of
necessity the United Kingdom buys
heavily from the dollar area, but cannot
use its favorable balances with other
countries to offset the adverse balance
with hard currency areas. A favorable
balance with France, for example, does
not earn dollars but only an increase in
France’s frozen debts. Further, many
countries within the sterling area
are running deficits with the dollar
area and call on Britain for addi-
tional supplies of dollars. Australia
is one of the offenders, and in her present
state of comparatively easy living
she has small justification. Calculations
of these additional drains over and above
f h f United Kingdom's own adverse
balance were not offered in the White
Paper, but one estimate, based on 'the
* in m 6 and confi^e d by the rate
draw j n g S s 0 f ar this year, is an amount
0 f £l5O million. This gives a total drain
of f5OO million for the year 1947. Even
without taking into account the pressure
that is now being exerted with some
success by Argentina and others for the
liquidation of part of their sterling
balances, it indicates that the dollars will
b e exhausted within two years, and that
the danger point will have been reached
•
Will Britain then be m a position to
maintain her present rate of imports?
Xhat bg ti enou P hto
afford them? Jt would hav? been a
colossal task in any case, and the time
allowed is less than had been bar-
gained for—largely because the inflation
<of U.S. prices by 30 p.c. since the
agreement was signed has reduced the
“spread” of the dollars. (This is not
compensated by higher prices received
fer exports to U.S. which are only one-
fifth of the corresponding imports.)
Again, America has been unable to
supply some of the raw materials, steel
in particular, which Britain requires for
the rehabilitation of her industries. The
scarcity of coal and the new five-day week
for miners, the power failures and up-
precedented flood damage to agriculture
are further contrary weights in the scale,
Coal and steel, which combined to make
20 p.c. of Britain’s exports during the
’thirties, are at present out of the picture
altogether.
On the other side there are still solid
bhses for hope. First is the gradual re-
cuperation of Europe. It is more natural
for Britain to trade with Europe than
with America, because such trade can be
on a bilateral basis. Britain depends on
a Continental revival for the un-
freezing of her own credits, for cheaper
and more accessible raw materials and for
balanced trading conditions. That re-
vival is slow but certain. Secondly, it is
reasonable to expect a fall in the costs
of British imports, including agricultural
products. A revival of the 1938 terms of
trade would improve the annual balance
by £225 million, and something approach-
ing , those terms may eventually be
attained when devastated agricultural
areas have beep reclaimed. The last
potential source of relief, and most im-
portant of all, is a rise in British pro-
ductivity. Despite all of fortune’s slings
and arrows to date, the export drive is
ahead of estimates, with further checks
still being removed. It may for a time
be necessary to yield ground and reduce
the few remaining non-essential im-
ports (films, tobacco). But no one will
doubt that Britons, with the issue clearly
before them, will respond to the occasion.


ABORIGINALITIES.
“E. 2”: Charlie had been working at
Mullins’s for three months before we
met him in the township. He was look-
ing for a new job. “Funny coot, that
Mullins,” he complained. “1 was gittin’
on real good there before he sacked
me. Why, he even reckoned I was a
reg’lar Ulysses —one o’ them Greek
jokers—about the place. Then he fired
me f’r spillin’ the skim-milk.” We didn’t
tell him that Mullins’s habit of
chewing his words before spitting them
out makes the adjective “useless” hard
to pronounce.

“B. A. Ker”; The engineer at our local
quarry started the machinery that sets
the conveyor belt moving on its endless
journey. Bringing blue metal from the
crusher to the loading chutes, the belt
rolls over a steel drum about a foot in
diameter before starting the return
journey. The speed of the conveyor
being at least 3 m.p.h., it is safe to say
that the drum revolves 4650 times in an
hour; therefore, when the machinery
was stopped at smoke-oh, two and a half
hours later, the roller must have made
something like 11,625 revolutions. And
the reason for this unwonted calculation
Well, when the drum ceased turning a
big silver-grey possum fell out, dropped
12ft. to the floor of the bin, and sat
staring Wearily into space. Yet, except
for the look in his eyes and a certain
baldiness about his person, the victim of
11,625 somersaults showed no sign of
injury. Ten minutes later he was still
sitting there, the most dizzy possum in
Australia; but at lunch-time he had
gone —presundably to find a good, stable,
old-fashioned log for a safe doss.

“Old-timer”: A mid-week day in
early March. Euston lay inert in the
bright heat, its color limited to the glare
of sunshine and the black blobs of
shadow. Nothing moved: not even a
dog was in sight, no wandering chook
explored the deserted road, the birds in
the timber line on the river were still.
A small cloud of dust appeared up the
Balranald-road and floated slowly to-
wards the old town, the topmast of a
swag and the upper works of its carrier
appearing and disappearing as the dust
rose and fell and rose again. Presently
the wanderer was through the boundary
gate and coasting for the shadows of
Medley’s pub. There he dropped the
swag to the verandah floor, peered
through narrowed eyes at the still village,
went to the bar, surveyed its emptiness,
padded down the passage, looked into
empty kitchen and parlor, gave the de-
serted yard a worried inspection, then
withdrew to the verandah and sat on his
swag. Nothing happened. Minutes
passed. Then the swagman sat up sud-
denly and stared across the road to
where, framed in the post-office door,
stood a figure naked to the waist, glar-
ing at the swagman through lowering
eyes and fingering a long butcher’s knife
whose steel was scarlet in the sunshine.
The swagman grabbed his swag and went
through the door like a crayfish. He
leaped as an awful groan sounded from
behind the dining-room door, caught a
confused glimpse of a body asprawl
in there and fled through the yard, along
the river and out on to the Tammit-road
with panicky visions of a murdered ham-
let and the killer on his track. Thus, in
their playful way, did the inhabitants of
the sleepy old place rid themselves of
Sid the Sponger, the most persistent
hummer in the Western Kaverina.

“Frank Mauri”: On the high, treeless
plateaus of Central New Guinea the
wind blows bitingly cold. During halts
on the march the native carriers squat in
a long line, each man sheltering behind
the one in front, After a little while
the front man, properly frozen, jumps
up and takes his position at the end
of the line. Thus each in turn has his
fair share of being windbreak.

“Atrax”: Despite the much-advertised
scattering of poisoned baits from ’planes
which will have already killed thousands
of useful birds, the dingo menace to

tinues to increase. Protective fencing is
ruled out by shortage of materials and
the high cost of any really useful type
of fence. Shooting and trapping are
the only effective methods of dealing with
the pest, blit expert knowledge and ex-
pensive outfits are required for these, and
the present rate of bonus is not sufficient
to make them attractive as a wholetime
job. An all-round Government guaran-
teed bonus of £1 per scalp would bring
.the dingo menace under control within
a few seasons, particularly if it were sup-
plemented by additional rewards for
killers of exceptional cunning.

“Jock”: We'had been spinning yarns
to Harry, a young friend from the city,
about the huge cod that were waiting to
be hauled out of the Gunbower Creek.
However, when he hooked one that was
large enough to bend the rod, we
witnessed a new technique for landing
fish. He let out a yell, raised the rod
above his head and headed bush with
the cod on the end of his line skimming
in like a motor-boat. When We eventu-
ally tracked him down, Old Bill’s only-
comment on unhooking the pulpy mass
was “Not a bad idea —catches, kills and
scales ’em all in the one action. Another
hundred yards and you’d have had it
filleted.”

“Colonel Bungstarter”: “Edjudina” (B.
12/3/’47) puts it delicately but correctly
in saying that “camels bite according to
season.” Mating season in particular,
for then a bull camel, moored by each
outspread hoof to a substantial stake,
pausing at intervals in his frantic bel-
lowing to blow out a bladder affair from
his gaping mouth and suck it in again,
will savage any stranger that he can
reach. To one such, anchored in the
camel lines of a Punjabi cantonment, 1
am indebted for the finest display of mul-
tilingual objurgation I’ve ever admired
on land or sea. From topee-strap-level
up the dear old O.C. was a polished bald-
ness, but a white fringe extended down
to his nape. “Disgusting brute, what,
he remarked as we came up to it, then
stopped to order the chief oont-wallah
to tidy up some rubbish on the other side
of the path. In a flash the bull shot his
head forward in an incredible neck-
extension and snapped at the back of the
colonel’s head. • A few inches further and
he would have scalped him, but only the
prehensile lips got within range to carry
away a substantial tuft of hair. With a
lightning swing round the old man laid
his cane across the animal’s nose, and
for five minutes thereafter tbld that camel
off in English, Hindustani and Punjabi,
omitting no slightest detail of its an-
cestry, anatomy, habits, character and
future. He fairly swore the cranky crea-
ture to a standstill. “Don’t stand any
nonsense from those uncivilised brutes,”
was his advice as we moved on. “Sets a
bad example to the natives if you let
yourself get annoyed with them.”

“Zake”: In the few hawk versus rabbit
bouts I’ve seen bunny has had no
answer to the beak-and-talon partner-
ship, but it’s different when the big flier
meets, or tries to meet, the hare in flat,
open country. There-the furred sprinter
adopts the same tactics as when he is
allowed a short flying start on the grey-
hounds, usually leaving the hawk to
gnash its beak in frustrated spite. But
where there is a hill the hare fails to
alter the tactics which invariably spell
defeat for the climbing dogs. This is
right into the hawk’s barrow. You can
almost see him licking his chops as he
drops behind and then swoops uphill.
Puss might pull off a few snappy sidesteps
with success, but the hawk will land his
one-course dinner in the end.

“D.R.H.”: The deadliest things in the
world and the most innocuous-looking in
appearance are bacteria —some bacteria,
that is; we couldn’t live without the
assistance of others of the tribe. Under
a microscope a drop of germ-laden water
looks like a glowing circle dotted about
with minute pieces of chopped-up hair,
the hair being ultra-fine. Which is why
I was surprised the other day when Joe
dropped in while I was messing about
with a milk sample, powdered cow-juice
that had been mixed up twenty-four hours
before and was feeling the weather.
“Struth! ” he exclaimed, looking up from
the eye-piece as I came back into the
room. “An’ that’s crook milk! Blanky
things swimmin’ about all roads —reg’lar
blasted zoo.” I knew there were no
motile bacteria present, and, in fact, that
the germs were by no means conspicuous,
so after the old chap had gone I had
another look. The slide was on the move,
all right, but the moving things were not
alive —in fact Joe had probably not seen
the germs at all. What he had seen were
tiny particles, probably of casein, wiggl-
ing about under the influence of Brown-
ian movement —so called because the
English botanist of that name was puzzled
by the movements of fine pollen grains
in water under his microscope. The
movement is explained by the theory
that the restless and invisible molecules
of water, elbowing each other, around
in the short-tempered way peculiar to
molecules, shove the visible particles in
suspension about like corks in a short
cross-sea.

. “Old Priller”: That yarn about, a
defiant cobra in the middle of a Malayan
road holding up the whole transport of
a brigade while n.c.o’s. and troops
searched round for a stick to clout it —
the snake being finally disposed of by
some bright spirit who charged it with
a utility truck (B. 19/ 3/’47)—fascinates
me. Wasn’t there a man in the whole
flamin’ unit good enough with a rifle to
shoot the thing?
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: “Hanko” mentions
immortelles (B. 26/2/’47). They re prob-
ably the flower which Westralians know
as everlastings, and which used to cover
the Darling Ranges within 30-odd miles
of Perth, flourishing in such profusion
early in the century that the Government-
controlled Railway Department organised
flower trains to the hills. The trains
left each Sunday morning crammed with
picnickers, who returned in the evening
laden with flowers. The jsight as they
bunched at the station barriers before
dispersing in the streets was one to re-
member. No flower trains now and
few flowers —just enough to indicate
what the hills must have looked like
long ago.

“Betcha”:. Sam ran into Lofty at the
crossing and pulled up. “Just bin talkin
t’ the old bloke up the road,” Lofty be-
gan- “Tells me our friend from over
yonder has bought a mob o’ ewes fro®
ol’ What’s-’is-name.” “Yair?” drawled
Sam interestedly. “Which ones? Them
he got in” “That’s them,” nodded
Lofty. “Coin’t’ breed from ’em.” “What
about rams?” was Sam’s query. “Aw,
he’s gettin’ some orf the old codger over
’ere. Y’ know; some o’ them
there” “Yair, I know. The ones he
bought about. ~ urn” “That’s right,”
answered Lofty. “Reckons he’ll breed a
line o’ lambs that’ll be just what he
wants.” “Gripes, he won’t, then,” Sam
scoffed. “Not with that cross. Them
ewes o’ old Thing-me-bob’s didn I
throw that way. Y’ remember?” “What,
the ones he got orf” “Yair. An I
bet these won’t, neither. But, cripes, y’
can’t tell ’em nothin’. ain’t
it, the way some coots work it out.”

“Mohu”: Birds only appear to be more
plentiful in settled, open country than
in dense bushland where the infinitely
greater number of perching places makes
for a wider dispersal of the feathered
population (B. 12/3/’47). Another rea-
son why birds seem to be scarcer in
dense, tree-clothed country is their silence
in gloomy surroundings, which exercise a
wet-blanketing effect on any form of life,
including even the echidna. Ive seen
in heavy forest gullies in the Otways
(Vic.) the brightest open-country song-
sters (magpies, butcherbirds, thrushes)
moving heavily from bough to bough as
mute and melancholy-looking as those
truly doleful residents of dense forest
country the green-throated and white-
crested wattlebirds.

“Wippegong”: Had met a couple of
cobbers from the old unit,- so a quiet
morning in the garden was indicated. I d
just lifted the lid of the drum where 1
try to hide the liquid manure when I let
out a yell and grabbed the fence for sup-
port. There, swimming and rolling about
in the brew, were horrible things. Like
great, corrugated maggots, they’d weave
along like seals playing at sea-serpents,
then roll over and change to backstroke
—and they had long tails. Armed with
a batten, I sneaked on them up-wind and
fished one out; they were real, all right,
so I sought my scientific friend—yes, 1
have one —and demanded the truth. It
was the larva of the “bee-fly” or “drone-
fly”—Eristalis tenax to you whose
amazing superficial resemblance to the
hive bee has deceived casual observers,
but which breeds in foul water and even
in decaying animal bodies. It was this
habit which tricked two foundation mem-
bers of the Council, Ovid and Virgil, into
stating that bees were generated in car-
casses. Possibly the same insect is mixed
up in the story of Samson’s claim to have
found a swarm of bees in what remained
of a lion with whifch he’d had a differ-
ence of opinion; personally, I’d like to
know what the ancient tough had been
up to the night before.

“Samuel Sawbones”: “Gravelsnatcher
(B. 12/ 3/ ’47) brings out a new one when
he gives the respiratory system of man
the credit for his beating the ants in the
race for animal supremacy, and revives
an outmoded error in crediting insects
with intellect instead of-instincts and
complex racial-conditioned reflexes. The
truth is, of course, that the ant has no
intellect and that his complicated seem-
ing civilisation has been evolved by the
continuous natural selection: of those ant-
which were best able to go through the
motions and drill without which the ant
and their community couldn’t survive. I
is a fascinating speculation that once
upon a time the ant had a thinking brain
and through it built up his complex wav
of life; that then a gang of pre-Fascists
or anti-Commos took control ms > tllle ,
the superdiscipline and liquidated all
those with wits enough to see the wav
they led and gizzards enough to oppose
them, and so bred the brains and initia-
tive out of the race to produce the organic
super-robots of their present perfect
Communist State. However, there still
lacks one primary distinguishing feature
of real intelligence. Though ants milk
and herd cows, mix and lay cement, fore-
tell the weather, build dams and lay
straight lines north and south, there is n
instance within my ken when an ant ha.
been known to devise or use a tool.

“Bo”: Old Bill Drayton had an ancient
steam-engine which he used for driving
the circular saw and the chaffcutter. The
new hand being shown around pointed
to the wooden blocks under the front
wheels of the engine which canted the
rusty boiler towards the back. “What’s
the idea of that?” he asked. “I thought
boilers were supposed to be dead level.”
“Aw, if yT pretty fussy I s’pose they
should be,” Bill replied. “But this one
goes awright. Y’ see, once or twice I’ve
let the water get below the gauge glass.
This type o’ boiler’s got a metal plug at
the back that melts when the boiler gets
too hot fer lack o’ water. Well, metal
plugs might be hard t’ get, so I tilted
the boiler back so that what water’s left
above the plates an’ tubes goes up an’
covers the plug an’ saves it from meltin’.”
“But, cripes,” exclaimed the hand, “ain’t
y’ takin’ a risk of either the plates bustin’
or the whole thing explodin’?” Bill re-
garded the hand pityingly, “Just work
out the risk for yourself,” he said calmly.
It’s an even-money bet, grantin’ yT
gloomy views of either the plates bustin’
or the whole works goin’ up. Now I’m
away from the boiler 10 times more than
I’m near it, so me charnces of goin’ sky-
high is around 20 to 1, ain’t it? Anyway,
the missus usually looks after this end of
it while I’m gettin’ up the log or the
chaff. Now, I bin livin’ just on 70 years,
an’ I never heard of a woman ever gettin’
blew up be a boiler, an’ I bet you ain’t,
either. So what’s there to worry about?”

“Esk D.”: Captain Twilight and his
two accomplices, having been in hiding
at their Lost Creek retreat after a daring
series of hold-ups, were riding down the
bush track on the way to a distant min-
ing town. Around a bend they came on a
small, ragged boy from whom they
gathered the tearful information that he
was lost. “We must find his place of
residence and take him there, bai Jove,”
exclaimed the gallant bushranger in
gentlemanly accents —it was said his an-
cestors were the most aristocratic crooks
ever hanged in the Old Country. “Ar,
eave the brat,” growled Red Harry.
‘His folk’ll find him some time, p’rhaps.”
“I won’t brook interference,” retorted
“ Aw , t’ hell with the book , Walter — I’ve done a lot of this!”
the leader. “This grubby urchin might
well grow up to be the oldest inhabitant
of these parts. And I say it would be
fitting if he could then relate firsthand
experiences of bushrangers.” With
that he swooped low in the saddle, picked
up the boy and galloped off to the selec-
tor’s homestead he saw in the distance.
Before placing his burden on the door-
step the captain whispered something in
the boy’s ear. A week later the bush-
rangers perished in a battle with troopers
at Sleepy Ridge. It was eighty years be-
fore Captain Twilight’s prophecy came
true and Tom Riddle became the oldest
inhabitant. One afternoon at the pub it
was seen that he was no longer wearing
his customary vacant expression. “I’ve
jist remembered,” he yelled in a thin
treble. “The exact place where the cap-
ting told me he’d planted that big haul of
gold they lifted orf the coaches.” He
then fell to the floor in a drunken stupor.
The bushranger’s hoard has never been
found.

“Fenelli”: Practical Standard Dic-
tionary (Funk and Wagnall, 1923) and
Everyman’s English Dictionary (1942)
both define “soom” (B. 5/3/’47) as verb
and noun (Scot); “swim.” Presumably
Kendall used the present participle of the
verb, i.e., “sooming.” Admittedly hard
to reconcile this with a “swimming sea”
or “swimmipg round the swooning
silence,” but perhaps he stretched a point,
and purely for alliterative aid used
“sooming” instead of, for instance,
“swirling.” The latter could fill the bill,
but would lessen the effect. Pardon my
ignorance, but was Kendall of Scottish
extraction?

“Mat’s Mate”: We were on a Sydney-
bound train for the Royal Show, cashed
up and slightly elevated, when the two
friendly gents entered our compartment,
discussed our wheat prospects and our
wool clips and their important friends
in the city, growled good-humoredly
about the monotony of train travel and
wondered l if a game of threepenny poker
wouldn’t break the tedium. Well, in a
battling and misspent life together we’d
lost things like that before, and I was
somewhat astonished when Mat agreed.
Of course, before long the game had
expanded and, of course, Mat and I were
allowed to win a couple of quid each to
bait us up. Then came the killing. Mat
received three aces pat, caught my eye,
went over the “blind” and sat back. I
pulled out. So did the other gent. Mat
bought two and turned them sufficiently
for me to sight a pair of “butchers.” His
opponent bought ope. The betting went
to a tenner and Mat called. “Afraid I’ve
got you beaten, old chap,” smiled the
dealer and laid down four twos, at the
same time reaching for the dough. “No
you ain’t,” Mat snapped. The gent, sat
like one shot. “Why, what have you
got?” he gasped. “A good fightin’ mate,
two good hands an’ a ruddy good mind
to tear you up!” roared the big fellow.
They didn’t even wait to see what time
it was.

“O’Took”: Noticing Inkbottle with his
foot coming around a bend and only a
few inches from a copperhead stretched
across the path, the boss pushed him
roughly aside and, swinging the length of
two-by-four he was carrying, caught the
snake squarely in the back with a blow
that would have felled a bull water-
buffalo. “You lucky fella that time, Ink-
bottle,” he said. “Might be,” the abo.
replied casually, turning the reptile over
with his big toe. In the hope of creating
some amusement at the expense of the
new hand, the boss took the snake home
and placed it conspicuously beside the
wash-basin. In half an hour the victim
of the joke came strolling along for
his pre-dinner scrub up; he stopped
suddenly, backed stealthily into the har-
ness shed and returned a moment later
wielding a hickory swingletree. Unaware
of the suppressed giggles coming from his
“We ’ad a good day, mum. Killed four an one got away.”
audience, he crept slowly upon his prey
and to the accompaniment of uproarious
laughter battered it to an oozy The
joke over and taken in good spirit all
round, Inkbottle summed up the situa-
tion with characteristic brevity. “ 'lm
proper dead fella now orrite.” “Yes,”
the boss chuckled, “Twice in one day.”
“T’ree time, boss,” Inkbottle corrected.
“Me killem first time longa sun come
up.”

“Tub”; “No, I wouldn’t bid on that
mob,” Ben said. “There’s a black poll
steer among ’em. Had one of ’em before
in a mob I was grazin’, an’ it got through
the fence an’ joined in with me neigh-
bor’s cattle. It was a new lot he’d
bought, an’ he couldn’t swear t’ any of
’em. Me eyes nearly popped out o’ me
head when I found two polls exactly the
same in the mob —brand, earmark an’
all. He challenged me t’ identify which
was mine, but they were so alike that f’r
the first time in me life Lcouldn’t swear
positively to a beast. At that the thievin’
old blankard told me t’ git me eyes, tested
before tryin’t’ claim his stock. It’d on’y
be once in a lifetime y’d strike two beasts
the dead spit of each other, an’ nothin’
short of a miracle’d produce three of a
kind, I wouldn’t have a black poll on
me place since.”

“Gryllus”: It is always a pleasure to
introduce a naturalist from overseas to
his first jumper-ant nest, particularly if he
happens to be wearing shorts. With gaze
fixed on the main entrance at the top of
the communal mound, he will be absorbed
in the saltatory antics of its guard. Mean-
while, tho real defenders will be pouring
out from the sally-port at ground level
to spring in all directions until they
locate the intruder. It is only polite to
warn the unwary victim before they
reach stocking-top level, though their
well-developed sting will probably have
already found its way through before
then. When the resulting acrobatics and
language have subsided, a peace offer-
ing of a tube-full of assorted bull-ants in
formalin will invariably assuage any an-
noyance. Bull-dogs and jumpers are of
unique interest to entomologists abroad.
Except for one New Caledonian species
the genus Myrmecia occurs nowhere else
in the world. In opening up communi-
cations with bug-addicts or institutions
overseas a properly-packed vial of them
is a never-failing introduction.

“Nagheer”: Even by old - timer
standards some really big timber is com-
ing out of the great tropical forests of
the Atherton district westward of Cairns
(N.Q.). A kauri pine from the Danbulla
forestry reserve measured 33ft. in butt-
girth, with a length of 70ft. to the first
main branch and a millable content of
around 33,000 super, feet. A cedar, still
standing in the Lake Barrine reserve be-
cause there are no available means of
transporting it, is 160 ft. high, with a
butt-girth of 37ft. and an estimated con-
tent of 28,000 super, feet of first-rate
cabinet timber. A profitable sideline is
the collection of gum from blue kauri
trees for use in overcoming the present
shortage of imported varnishes. Southern
manufacturers are offering up to £l4O
per ton, f.o.b, Cairns.
“Ex-Mister”; For sheer, cool, physical
courage displayed in the cause of science
it would be difficult to equal the per-
formance of Dr. R. A. M. Case, leader
of a research team aboard the British
whaling vessel Balaena. Information re-
garding the precise body-temperature of
whales, hitherto not accurately deter-
mined, was needed for investigation into
methods of preserving whale meat for
human consumption. Wearing a “frog-
man” suit. Case dived into the Antarctic
while a whale was making its last surfac-
ing rise after being harpooned, swam
uryier the vast writhing bulk and shot a
thermometer deep into its still - living
body. A last tremendous flurry filled the
suit’s breathing gear with water while
he was still deep down, and rescue came
only after he had; lost consciousness.
Nootka Indians used to jump on the back
of a wounded whale and finish it off with
knives, but that was kids’ play compared
with getting underneath the brute in its
death agony, and for purely scientific
purposes only at that.

“Blime”: Bill’s rabbit pack lacked a
runner or two, so when he heard that
Barney had a greyhound for sale Bill
went over to give the long-legged tyke a
tryout. Soon the hunters put up a rab-
bit, and the chase was on. Across the
flat they went to the division fence,
where the quarry dived through a hole
in the netting, the pack following over
the top wire in fine style—all but
Barney’s greyhound, which landed in a
sprawling heap and lost a lot of ground.
Bill said nothing, but scowled his disap-
proval as the runner again badly
op the next chase. More rabbits were
put up, but at every fence the perform-
ance was repeated. “Well, he runs well
enough,” Bill remarked finally, “but it’s
no good me taking him. He can’t
jump.” “Too flamin’ right he c’n
jump,” defended Barney indignantly.
“It’s like gettin’ orf a tram while she’s
goin’, I tell y’. Takes practice. An’,
cripes, y’ can’t blame a dog f’r bein’
extra keen. Streak ain’t one o’ them lazy
cows that sits back ’n waits till they
hit the ground. He starts runnin’ again
soon as he clears the fence top.. An’
surely it ain’t his fault if he mostly
strikes her while he’s orf his stride!”
* * * *
“D.R.H.”: Down at the creek below
the house a smooth, even ribbon of
purple slate sand sweeps round under
thirty-foot banks, mallee-topped on one
hand and past a cape-like park of blue-
green pine on the other. The rising moon
floods that street of sand at night, leav-
ing dense black shadow under the bank
and turning the pines into a glory of
silver, blue and black. And in the
morning, on the sand, I find tracks that
belong to no creature that I’ve seen in
20-odd years of knocking about in the
bush and in the scrublands. The tracks
are two parallel lines an inch or so
apart. The pairs follow each other round
the bend to the big sand drift in the lee
of the pines. There they mix up in a
tangle of similar marks, as though a
horde of little creatures came each moon-
light night to play in the sand. If kanga-
roos sat back on their hocks at each
jump one might believe that tiny, fairy
kangaroos played between the shadow
and the light. I suspect the track-makers
to be some of the little jerboa mice, and
it’s at least as good as the fairy tales of
my infancy to read the story of their
midnight parties on the sand and to
imagine the queer little beasties with
their huge ears and brush-tipped tails
dancing under the pines.
AN OLD MAID PASSES.
Lean cats prowl hungrily about the door
Of her who is no longer “on the shelf,”
Seeking in vain the morsels kept and given
When tea-soaked crusts were all she had her-
self.
Her poverty she struggled to conceal
With hints at stocks and shares she’d put
away;
But who could hide from some shrewd woman’s
gaze
Those furtive visits every pension day?
Disclosed now all the secrets she withheld
From prying neighbors’ eyes the long years
through:
The few bare sticks of furniture she had;
The bags for curtains and for mattress, too;
And smoke-stained portraits on the sagging
wall,
Her father and her mother, held so dear,
He bearded, she in crinolines—and each '
A target for the idle jest and sneer.
Not hers the Funeral Notices to make;
No relative regrets her, lone and poor;
If she is missed and mourned it’s only where
Lean cats prowl hungrily about her door.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Molybdenum in S.A.
“Jock”; In the Meadows Valley of
S.A. molybdated super, has been used
for three or four years. That the soil
was molybdenum-deficient was discovered
when Norman Brookman noticed the
growth response after throwing out pro-
ducer-gas ash. The Waite Institute
analysed the ash, and 20-odd constitu-
ents'were tried out. Well in front for
growth response was molybdenum, with
zinc and copper showing slight effect.
The next year molybdated super, was
broadcast in the district with amazing re-
sults, especially on the rubbly ironstone
hillsides. Molybdenum, being a heavy
metal, is extremely soluble, and it may be
that over the years it has been washed
out of the hillsides, leaving them deficient.
Where it was supplied there was increased
legume growth (that of native clovers on
an unimproved hillside to such an ex-
tent that it cut for meadow hay) and pro-
longed green period. This long green
period is important in this district, with
its cold winter, as it allows a late lamb-
ing to miss the cold and there is still
green fodder after Christmas for fatten-
ing.
All this is seen after one broadcasting
of about loz. of molybdenum (optimum
dosage Hoz.) with one cwt. of super,
per acre. Whether it will be necessary
to re-apply molybdenum in future years
remains to be seen. It would be a good
idea for the farmer to try a garden-sized
patch of molybdenum. The pure molyb-
dic acid can be bought from a manu-
facturing chemist for under 2s. an ounce,
and it can be hand-scattered or watered
in. If a response is seen, molybdated
super, will show a good return on the
extra cash necessary. At present this
super, is difficult to buy (in Vic.), but
when last available it sold for £7 7s. per
ton against £5 11s. for ordinary super.
On country which will give a double or
better response it means cheap grass.
A Jetting Mixture.
“Myrrhee”: Both for economy and
the length of time it protects (four or
five weeks against three weeks for arsen-
ite of soda), R. N. McCulloch, in the
N.S.W. “Agricultural Gazette,” recom-
mends calcium arsenite. Made on the
farm it costs, for ingredients, about Bs.
per 100 gallons. To make the mixture
put four 4gal. buckets of water on the
fire ; into each of four empty buckets
weigh ylb. caustic soda and 41b. white
arsenic. Weigh into clean buckets four
41b. lots of stone lime. Take the first
bucket of water that comes to the boil,
pour half the contents into a bucket into
which the soda and arsenic have been
measured, and place on the fire. Use
the remaining water to slake 41b. lime.
When the liquid in the arsenic-soda bucket
is clear, lift from the fire and gently
pour the milk of lime into it, taking
care that the mixture does not boil over.
Put the bucket of concentrate beside the
fire to simmer for lsmin,, when it will
be ready for use. Four buckets of the
mixture will make 40gal.* of jetting fluid
and can be prepared by one man- in an
hour. Plenty of buckets will be needed
“Salt, pepper, mustard, vinegar!”
—for instance, if 2000 sheep are to be
jetted, have two dozen buckets on hand.
Add water to the four bucketfuls of the
concentrate to make 40gal. of 1 p.c.
arsenic solution.
“ Victorian Wheats.
“Ben Cubbin”: My namesake won the
Mallee 'wheat championship this year,
though it had but a quarter-bushel
lead on yield over Quadrat, which filled
second and third places, Magnet being
fourth. The winning Bencubbin crop
was grown by F. J. Hofmaier, the Rose-
bery man who has been heard of in Mr.
Hogan’s erosion competitions and who,
it seems, has discovered the secret of
making Mallee farming pay.
Bencubbin, of course, is a tried per-
former with about ten years of success as
a good farmer’s wheat to its credit.
Quadrat and Magnet, both products of
the Mallee research station at Walpeup,
are apparently justifying the claims made
for them on release a couple of years
ago. There were 44 crops in the contest,
from Swan Hill down to Beulah. Hbf-
maier’s crop yielded 28£ bushels an acre
in a year which gave a moist seed-bed,
with fair rains up to August and a dry
spring. It went 651 b. to the bushel. Hof-
maiei*s method with it was to throw the
paddock out after the 1941 wheat, sow
it for grazing oats in 1942 and leave it
to grass until 1945, when it got a fairly
heavy discing in August, was worked in
November, February and late March and
sown in mid-May with 751 b. of seed and
751 b. of super, an acre.
Down in the Wimmera the victory went
to a Magnet and Quadrat crop of 53.8
bushels grown by C, H. Ghampness at
Kaniva. A Magnet crop at Kiata was
second with 50 bushels and the old stand-
by, Ghurka, won third prize for Drung
South. It was a good year in the Wim-
mera, and Ghampness, a young man,
produced a crop which made the judges
most enthusiastic, the yield being a record
for Wimmera contests. He grew it on
one-year-fallowed strong black soil which
had been under grass since 1939. It was
mouldboard-ploughed in August, .worked
seven times and sown in May with 751 b.
of seed and 941 b. of super. The Magnet
went 631 b. to the bushel and the Quadrat
64|lb.
Magnet—first, third and fourth —and
Quadrat second “cleaned up” the
Northern Vic. contest —the first of its
kind there —with yields of 50.15, 49.8,
38 and 42 bushels. T. Klemm grew the
winner at Londrigan, the others being at
Dookie, Springhurst and Yarrawonga.
Like the Mallee and Wimmera winners,
it was grown on had been out
to grass for some years, and it got good
rains ‘right through. Klemm had top-
dressed the paddock with super, five
times during the nine years it was past-
ure. It was ra.b.-ploughed in January,
worked thrice and sown in late April with
901 b. of seed and about the same amount
of super. Sheep grazed it lightly (one
day) during the winter.
Thatching Grass.
“E.H.S.”: Straw of wheat, barley, oats,
and rye is used almost exclusively as
thatching material in this country, as
supplies are usually on the spot. Rushes
provide a better and more enduring
material, but the indigenous bayonet grass
is far superior to any of them.
Although it is widely distributed
throughout the hilly and mountainous dis-
tricts of Australia, particularly on poor
granitic or gravelly soils, its value as a
roofing material is little known. The
plant attains a height of about 3ft, and
it is close and tough in fibre and practic-
ally non-absorbent. It is a perennial,
evergreen and ready for cutting at any
period of the year. This material, which
is readily available, may be had for the
cost of cutting; transport to site and
fixing in position entails a very small ex-
penditure in time or cash in the con-
struction of a waterproof and durable
roof. I save seen the roofs of buildings
thatched with bayonet grass in excellent
condition after 25 years.
The thatched roof is, of course, more
liable to destruction by fire than some
of those constructed of manufactured
materials, but it runs no more risk than
the more expensive shingle roof, which
is still used wherever shingle-splitting
timber is available. In view of the ex-
orbitant price of roofing material, and
the difficulty of securing it at all,* the
man on the land might find it to his ad-
vantage to use bayonet grass for thatching
out-buildings.
Country Garden Design.
“Pat O’Day”: The old English type of
country home lends itself to enhance-
ment by large grounds wherein native
trees may be retained in the garden lay-
out, and sweeping lawns (bordered with
neat flower-beds) show off the dignity of
the house. Stately white-box, glossy
privet hedges and hawthorn hedges
(which demand a lot of attention in fre-
quent clipping), large circular- and
diamond - shaped flower - beds with
massed displays of various flowers prove
most eye-arresting. Homes in the Spanish
or Moorish design suit the landscape in
hilly districts, where a great variety of
trees, shrubs and exotic flowers may be
grown—water usually being available
from springs and dams.
Grow junipers (a lovely conifer) and
cypresses— Sempervirens stricta —against
white walls, where the dark green of the
cypress is set off to advantage. A flagged
courtyard with rose and wistaria arches
is easy to design, rounded pillars being
best for the arches.
Plant a rounded or winding drive of
mountain pines ( Radiata ) leading to the
house. All types of pdims' may be grown
in the hilly districts, therefore a line of
Canadensis (hardy ornamentals) inter-
spersed with the willowy Cocos palms is
worth seeing.
Make a three-terraced lawrf, if sloping
ground allows. The third terrace being at
foot of garden will resemble a sunken
garden. Sink a rounded 4ft, lily pond
in centre of one of the lawns and grow
Nyntphcea (these water-lilies are available
in blue, pink, cream, red and white) and
water hyacinths ( Eichhornia crassipes).
AH types of cypress suit the architec-
ture of any home, especially the Spanish
type; Lambertiana, Lawsoniana, Macro-
carpa, Toruloca for outlining the garden
and for contrast.
Rounded stone walls on the terraces
can be the main beautification if they are
designed to hold various exotic flowers—
the geranium, though somewhat despised,
is very beautiful if grown in the soil of
the hollow walls. Pelagonium, the trail-
ing type, should be blended —magnolias,

Tomato Tips.
“Flea”; I find itj safer to prune
tomatoes by starting at the top of the
plant instead of the bottom. The reason
is that should a set or lateral be pinched,
out in error the mistake can be rectified
lower down the stem, whereas if these
lower laterals have already been pinched
out, you have nothing to work on. Never
touch a sickly-looking plant during prun-
ing, otherwise the hands may become
and the virus passed on to
healthy plants.
Use a piece of H-in. piping about 2ft.
6in. long, plugged one end, fitted over the
top of the stake like a sleeve, to drive
stakes home. They drive straighter and
easier than with a mallet or hammer.
Decomposed stable manure is by far the
best fertiliser, as it supplies plant foods
as well as humus. Apply it by hand as
a side dressing, first being sure all the
heat has gone from it. Not only does
this help the current crops but it improves
the soil for subsequent sowings.
iAnt Robbers.
“R.F.0.”: Wishing to establish an 80-
acre paddock of grazing lucerne, I broad-
cast 21b. of seed per acre in front of the
horse-drawn combine. The light harrows
behind did the covering. At midday
the share cocky fed and spelled his horses
for two hours. Before knocking off for
my qwn lunch I broadcast three rows
ready for the afternoon’s start. The re-
sulting germination was excellent, except
for the three rows. They were a com-
plete blank, A few weeks later I noticed
small piles of seed around ants’ nests in
an unworked paddock. It was easy to
figure out that, during our two hours’
lunch spell, the little black toilers had
gathered up the lucerne-seed before it
could be covered.
Crop Dusting.
“Bogan Joe”: This dusting of orchards
and crops from the air is not all
it is cracked up to be and may be the
cause of considerable trouble. For in-
stance, a dusting which might be ideal
for tomatoes in one paddock may be
sudden‘death to a peach crop next door,
since calcium arsenate dust for controll-
ing certain tomato pests is definitely
harmful to peaches. The same can be
said of copper dusts. On the other hand
sulphur is excellent to control brown rot
in peaches, but if it drifts into an apple
orchard recently sprayed with oil to
control red mite, the mixture will burn
the leaves and fruit.
D.D.T. is a splendid pest-controller in
many crops, but it can kill fish in the
creeks and rivers, and arsenic dusts set-
tling on pastures could kill stock. There
should be no aerial dusting without a
permit from the Agricultural Department
representative in the area concerned, and
it should be done under his supervision
until such time as the chemists produce
an all-purpose insecticide which will kill
insects but not affect plants or fruit.
Hints for the Farm.
“Bill C.”: A walk around the stock
paddocks straightening things up occa-
sionally takes up little time, but can save
a deal of worry. Look out for the seed-
lings of poison peach, nightshade and
similar pests. They can’t establish them-
selves if they’re not allowed to seed or
make strong root -systems from which to
sucker. Broken strands of barbed-wire
trailing away from an otherwise sound
fence are dangerous. Only safe fence
where young, active stock are held is a
tight one; they’ll try to pass loose fences
and may be tangled up. See that the pad-
dock used for newly-purchased stock is
well fenced and free from dangerous
objects.
“Sarina”: Overstocking is bad any-
where, but is particularly dangerous on
river frontages, for in such places • it’s
likely to ruin the stream as well as the
pastures. Constant eating back of verge
bushes and grass and trampling of banks
deprive them of cover and breaks them
down. The soil is washed into the holes
and shallows them, causing them to dry
very quickly in a drought.
“Re-tread”: Last season my Five
Crown apple-tree was absolutely alive
with codlin. I listened to the wise words
of a gardening friend and sowed nastur-
tium seed —Golden Gleam —around the
tree. AH through the spring and sum-
mer they made a great splash of color —
and this week I picked a fine crop of
apples without a trace of the moth. 1
am going to stick to nasturtiums and let
spraying go hang.
“Sundowner”: A phenothiazine drench
for worms gives much more lasting re-
sults than nicotine sulphate or copper
sulphate, but its cost of 2d. to 3d. per
sheep is largely restrictive. As drenching
is only a means of removing worms, it is
necessary to prevent infestation by a
change of pasture and better feeding con-
ditions. Drenching gives the sheep a
chance to recover and should be done at
ten-day intervals. As phenothiazine
stains the wool it is advisable to use a
cloth to wipe the mouth.
“Billjim”: Sulphonated oil on stems
and trunks will protect young fruit-trees
from rabbits. To make the mixture lin-
seed oil should be made smoking hot,
placed outside and flowers of sulphur
added, one part to nine parts of oil by
weight making a 10 p.c. solution. Sift
tne sulphur slowly into the hot oil and
stir. The mixture will become hotter
until alf the sulphur is dissolved. For
a spray it can be thinned with turpentine.
Copper, soap and cayenne pepper are
additional repellents, while strychnine
with the mixture will kill rabbits if they
eat the bark.
Selling of racing tips at a bob a time
was once a profitable business. The Law
has rightly wiped it out. Over a thousand
tips for a bob is good value anytime,
when the tips are such as those in “Handy
Hints for the> Farm,” from newsagents
or The Bulletin for Is. (Is. 2jrd. posted).

but he didn’t seem nearly that. He lisped
and was not over-quick in summing up
things. The new “Maloney” was explained
to him, and Bartley was delighted. He
looked at Darkie and regarded him as a
happy sort of puzzle: “I’ve theen thome-
one juth like you.” Darkie tried to brace
himself for the great exposure and looked
piteously to Joey.
“So you’ve been out Riverside way of
late, Uncle Bartley?”
“Riverthide! ” and that set Bartley on
a new tack. Darkie breathed his relief
and wished he were out of it altogether.
When were they going to start, he’d like
to know? But he daren’t say anything.
Then the threatening storm rumbled
and grumbled and broke with a wild rush
of wind and a swish of water. “And you
can’t go in that, nohow,” said Granny.
“And what will your poor mither be say-
ing and thinking?”
“It’s only the summer storm, and it
will be after clearing soon.”
But it didn’t. After exhausting its first
fury of thunder and lightning it kept up
a belting and drumming of rain on the
roof. Unfortunately, this seemed to im-
prove Granny’s hearing considerably.
Then Joey remembered that his mother
was more than half expecting them to stay
with Granny that night—if they were
asked to —and that she had always said
to stay where he was when a storm like
.that came on.
So they had tea. The only faculty left
to Darkie was that which governed the
consumption of food. And then .came
fresh terrors in the form of the Rosary,
Certainly Darkie had heard of the Rosary
■ —most disrespectfully referred to —but
he had practically no idea of what it con-
sisted.
“Have you your beads, Joey?”
Joey made a search of his pockets to
indicate that he never went about with-
out his beads. He looked blank ahd dis-
appointed : “Och, Granny, what will you
be thinking now —but they are in the
pocket of me other shirt —I’m only re-
membering now.” Darkie, it seemed, was
also wearing a different shirt.
“But I’ll be counting thim on the
fingers for this once, 5 ' Joey announced.
Darkie decided to do the same.
Those prayers went on for ever —when
the Rosary and the “Regulars” were
finished Granny took up a special lot of
“trimmings” on her own account: there
was Patrick up in Queensland —and God
only knowing what he was doing with
himself, but nothing very good unless the
prayers were being heard; there was
Cath —and she expecting shortly; there
was Joey’s mother —and she with worries
enough, too; there was poor Mrs.
Doolan, Amby’s wife, that is, and a re-
quest for a happy death for her ; there
was Miss Curnow and God in His
mercy stop her backbiting ...
And there were extra specials and
“topicals,” as it were: Joey himself, and
success in his undertakings in life;
Darkie and relief to his great sorrow;
Darkie’s brother going in for the priest-
hood, bless him; the storm, that it
wouldn’t bring down the creek in flood
and wash away the new fence.
Over at last, Granny kissed the two
boys and gave them night-gowns and put
them in the “little ind room” and
sprinkled them with holy water from the
font on the wall near the door ~.
The rain still poured—a steady, effort-
less eternity of rain.
Darkie spoke, “Joey, I’m clearing out
of this,”
“And where would you go to?”
“I —I don’t know.”
“So you want to go home. Isn’t that
it?”
The true spirit of bushranging had long
since oozed .out of Darkie. The past
hours and the storm had killed it,
“I don’t want to go home.
“But you want to give up bushrang-
ing ! ”
A ghost of indignation came over
Darkie. Only a ghost. He was a broken
man and he knew it,
“You’ll go to sleep now, Darkie, that’s
what you’ll do.” Joey said it persuasively
and tenderly. It
calmed the nerves.
They got into the
three-quarter bed
together. They
weren’t bush-
rangers any more.
In any case, what-
ever hurt there
might be to a
boy’s pride in the
wearing! of night-
gowns, these gar-
ments were too
ridiculous and incongruous for bush-
rangers. But wear them they had to—
Granny had seen to that. They slept.
THERE was a bright sun, a pale sky
with the color washed out of it and a
clean new world when they woke up. A
new world entirely, and yesterday but a
dream, and joining all the yesterdays,
which were dreams, too. Only the pre-
sent is ever real.
Granny was long since up, she always
rose early, and there was the smell of
bacon and eggs—and turkey-eggs at that.
And there were porridge and brown sugar
and creamy milk in the big blue jug.
Soldier barked savagely; there was a
clatter of hoofs through the sliprails.
Darkie heard fate and doom and retribu-
tion in the sounds. He was justified. It
was his father —come to take him home.
Only to get away from this place! He
sneaked out and said “I’m coming now
-—straightaway.”
And not a word said about “cutting the
tail off him,” Perhaps—■
“I must see Mrs. Shane first,” said his
father.
“I’ll wait for you at the second rails—
Dad.”
“All right!*’
Mr. Grey went into conference with
Granny. Bartley didn’t come into it at
all. It was a most enlightening confer-
ence. At last Granny stood on the veran-
dah —where the boards were not so
broken —and saw a dimming vision of
the father and son threading in and out
among the trees.
“So there goes your Michael Terence
Maloney! ” She shook a small, hard, bony
fist. Then she went to look for Joey. As
she might have expected, Joey was no-
where in sight—nor would he be for a
long, long time.

From the Diplomatic Front.
The Australian Ambassador was in
the middle of one of his important press
conferences at the Embassy.
“Yep, sirree,” said Norman, as he
waved a hand expansively at the ring of
Washington press boys, “we sure gaht the
industrial woiks sewn up down under,
and then some. No dodgasted union
bahss can push a gat in our Govern-
ment’s slats and holler for it to reach
for the sky like you-all allow John L.
Lewis and his soft-coal buddies to get
away with. Sand, that’s what our Prime
Minister’s gaht—an’ gaht a-plenty. Yep,
he don’t know his own moral strength.
In fact, boys, between you and me and
a downtown skittle alley it pahsitively
frightens him at times thinkin’ jest how
strahng he is. Hair on his chest lik'e a
dinner plate. Yep, one strong, stern look
from Ben Chifley and every' militant
union bahss cowers in fright. v Some of
’em heave ’emselves over the Gap—they
just kain’t take it.”
“We’ve heard, Mr. Makin, that he
can’t control the coalminers,” cut in one
reporter,
“Shucks, boys, that’s sure the bunk,”
replied Norman. “I’ll give you just one
instance of how he deals with ’em. A
bunch of Red bozos came from the mine-
fields to Canberra one day. Their big
shaht started to threaten a nation-wide
tie-up if they didn’t get free beer with
their crib and weren’t given the right to
sack the management. Ben steps forward,
his steely jaw set and his eyes a-blazin‘.
‘Back to the pits! ’ he thundered.
‘Pronto. An’ I won’t stand for no
paralysin’ the nation. Strike, an’ I’ll de-
register the union, freeze its funds an’
indict you for criminal conspiracy. Now
scram, an’ get this straight, you bunch
o’ hornswogglin’ hicks — I ain't gain’ to
crucify the wage-payers!” They slunk out
like mangy coyotes, flat beaten. That was
durin’. the war—they hasn’t bin one
strike on our coalfields since! In fact, we
got so much coal we don’t know what to
do with it all.
“An’ take the longshoremen. Sure we
had trouble, lahts of it, until ‘Biceps’
Ben came to power. Another Ivan
Skavinsky Skavar —that’s Ben. But when
the Sydney longshoremen steamed up
against Ben with their strong-arm stuff
he manhandled ’em until they snuck back
to their holds, cowed good and proper.
Now there’s never a pip out of' ’em.
Afraid to strike, they woik like mad and
ships are turned round right smarter than
any other ports in the world. And pil-
lagin’? Not a dime’s-worth a year!
“But you guys ain’t heard nothin’ yet.
Gahd’s own country down under is the
lowest-taxed country ever. The cost or
living’s way down lower than before the
war ; housewives have none o’ the worries
yous have got here. Production’s sky-
high, everything delivered to their doors,
no shortage of anything. Our Housing
Commission’s so far ahead of orders the
painters kain’t keep up with the demand
for ‘To Let’ and ‘For Sale’ Boys,
it*s sure a wonder country, an’ then
some.
“And another thing we’re mighty proud
of —we gaht the most popular Governor-
General we ever had. Only a small in-
significant section of the pahpulation
don’t cotton to him—bookies, jockeys,
pugs, saloon-lqeepers, and professional
footballers. For the rest, whenever he
leaves his mansion great cheering crowds
gather. An’ when he comes down our
Broadway in his Rolls, there’s always a
ticker-tape storm. And dignified yep.
I’ll say Vice-King Billy’s dignified—the
way he sings out ‘Hi-ya, Joe’ from his
Rolls whenever he sees an A.L.P. sup-
porter ’d rock ’em in the brownstone
mansions of Long Island. Why, our,
Sydney Bulletin refers to him as ‘His
Magnificence.’ Say, could you get a
more sincere tribute to a man who con-
tributed so much to our common war
victory by starting a Turf Club?”
“The criticism has been levelled at you,
Mr. Ambassador,” cut in a reporter,
“that yours is an overgoverned country. ’
Norman gasped. “Say, someone’s sure
been in there pitchin’ a phoney! ” he said.
“Why, boys, we gaht fewer politicians per
capita than any other goldarned country.
And, what’s'more, they’ve stoutly resisted
all efforts to get ’em to accept a salary
raise. And another thing—and this is
right on the record —we gaht no Tam-
many in Australia. No such thing as find-
ing for a defeated and discredited Minis-
ter or Cahngressman a specially-made
jahb at a fancy salary and perks. No,
sirree, we put our face against all such
tactics. And another”
The reporters during this last state-
ment bent curious looks on the Ambas-
sador. Now one of them held up his
notebook.
“Excuse me, Mr. Ambassador,” he said.
Then he pointed to a small, polished
ebony kangaroo on the desk. “Would
you mind telling us what color that is?”
Norman looked at it, then released the
fatuous grin that is his chief diplomatic
asset.
“Are you boys kiddin’?” he asked.
“Why, there must be something wrahng
with your eyesight if you kain’t see it’s
white.”
The reporters snapped their books shut
and as one man they chorused Pete
Smith’s famous “Good-bye, now!” and
departed, leaving Norman scratching his
head and saying, “Say, can you beat
that! Now, stone the coyotes, what have
I bin sayin’?”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4Jd. per linp; all others 2*d. per line.
The R.A.N.
As a legacy from the last two wars,
when Britain and the U.S.A. provided
command of the sea for us, most Aus-
tralians automatically think of an army
when defence is mentioned. They should
realise that Australia-is an island and that
its sea and air defences are more im-
portant than its land defence. Rocket-
borne atomic-bombs won’t make any of
the services obsolete —navies, armies and
air forces will always be used and ships,
particularly, are not an atomic target.
Australia’s naval requirements are:
(1) A naval force designed in balance with
the land and air forces, the whole conceived to
fit in an Empire scheme of defence.
(2) A navy capable of assuming local com-
mand of the sea on the outbreak of war.
(3) Sufficient naval units to provide efficient
training in all forms of naval warfare.
(4) A service capable of expansion to absorb
its full proportion of Australia’s manpower
when the country is at war.
The least force which can assume com-
mand of the sea locally is a task group
built around an aircraft-carrier. This
entails, in addition to the carrier itself,
four anti-aircraft cruisers and ten
destroyers, with a fleet train to maintain
the group. There must be at least two
submarines with their own depot ship,
eight frigates for minesweeping, escort
and anti-submarine work, a minelayer,
harbor-defence vessels and shore estab-
lishments, including “Seabees.” The
havy should assume its proper function
of providing sea transport for the army
and air force, so assault ships, landing-
craft and transports must also be pro-
vided. The aircraft-carrier, half of the
cruisers, destroyers and frigates, both
submarines and one at least of each type
of other large vessel should be in full
commission, manned by long-service pro-
fessionals. The remainder should be in
reserve, ready for immediate manning.
The idea of a large expansion is com-
paratively new in the Navy. Before the
last war the concept was that the R.A.N.
permanent sea-going personnel provided
a squadron while the Reserves filled in
the lesser parts. In future, it should be
the policy of the R.A.N. to expand by
using Reserves in all classes of ships im-
mediately war breaks out.
Men can be trained faster than ships
can be built, so it will be necessary to
build vessels locally in peace-time on a
long-term plan. As new ships are con-
structed they should be commissioned and
those paid off put into reserve. That
would ensure that dockyard facilities,
with trained personnel, would be avail-
able for accelerated construction after
war breaks out. Gun, torpedo, rocket
and explosive factories should also be kept
going.
No reliance should be placed on the
Merchant Navy for Reserves, as experi-
ence has shown that it needs all the
trained personnel it can get. Emphasis
should be on training personnel from
the shore, and this should be done on a
compulsory basis.
To achieve a successful expansion, a
change of heart on the part of profes-
sional officers is required—the Straight
Striper must accept the Wavy Navy fully.
For a start, why not abolish the wavy
stripe? Neither the Army nor the Air
Force uses it, or any equivalent. Con-
versely, a scheme of commissioning
ratings of the permanent sea-going forces
into the Reserve should be put into effect.
There should be other changes in the
permanent sea-going forces. Every
officer should be able to fly, and should
be trained in submarines as well as every
type of surface ship. Pensions for both
officers and ratings should be introduced
instead of the deferred-pay system, and
there should be retainers for retired per-
sonnel who are willing and competent to
serve in war. The status of the rating
should be raised, perhaps leaving the pay
of an A.B. on the basic wage, but pay-
ing highly for technical qualifications and
for good-conduct badges.— Also Ran
(Q-).
P.-0.-w. Subsistence
So Army Minister Chambers has
finally decided that ex-p.-0.-w. are to be
bilked of, their subsistence money. So
that this won’t be taken as the disgruntled
wail of a grizzler, let me state that I’ve
had a crack at both wars, have come off
second-best on both occasions and have
had a fair spin from Repat. each time.
But this 3s. a day claim is a very differ-
ent matter —this was money actually
owed to us. The “Labor” Government,
which claims to stand up for the under-
dog, allowed payment of daily field allow-
ance to the officers for the whole period,
hut now refuses the o.rs. their miserable
allowance. All soldiers know that these
payments are equivalent ones, taking rank
into account.
As far as Canberra is concerned Turn-
bull and Blain, who were with us, seem
to be the only ones fighting for us. No
members of any other party have made
any protests.
Apparently the Government, regarding
the matter from the election point of
view, considers that the ex-p.-0.-w. are
only a handful, and their adverse vote a
negligible quantity. But our friends and
sympathisers are legion. Re-Tread
(Vic.).
Withholding of subsistence pay, 3s. a
day, from ex-p.-0.-w. is “justified” on
the grounds that much has been
done for us already and that the
Japanese gave us food to the value
of Is. 2d. a day. I’d like to know
what special treatment we got from our
own Government worth £2OO. I’ll admit
we were trealed like kings when we
were released, but as far as I remember
“Gimme other arm a go—this one's getiin'
a bit tired.”
it was by (a) the. Yanks, (b) the British
Navy and (c) the Red Cross.
The special treatment we received from
our own Government included 60 days
less pay in lieu of leave than other units
with similar services. Also leave given
before our confinement in hospitals
normally counted as sick leave —was
debited against our accumulated leave.
And if Federal Ministers are paying
Is. 2d. for two pints of very wet rice and
a spoonful of radish tops, the matter
shbuld be reported to the Prices Com-
missioner.—Ex-N.X. (N.S.W.).
Victorian Housing
A visitor approaching Melbourne on the
airways could easily imagine that after all
a Jap bomber squadron had reached the
city and had been too successful. Roof-
less houses are visible in all directions.
Some of them have been waiting for
their lids for six months and over, and
are likely to rot before they get them.
The “Labor” Government’s latest mea-
sure to deal with this position is to
assume complete control of materials; a
typically bureaucratic procedure. There
are no materials to control, and there is
needed not more restrictions by hordes
of officials but more production.
One ex-serviceman faced with the pros-
pect of having to house his family in a
roofless dwelling through the winter took
his own precautions. He was on a building
construction job in New Guinea and was
short of galvo, so he had to let the
natives have a go. They knew more
about it than he did ; m a few days they
had put up excellent roofs of kunai
which earned him a pat on the back from
his C.O.
Obtaining oaten straw from a neighbor-
ing farmer, this Digger put up a strong,
thick, cool and attractive-looking thatched
roof impervious to water, as they have
done for centuries in England, The look
of the timber didn’t matter, as it was un-
seen, so he used rough bush timber. The
result was a thoroughly serviceable head-
piece which cost him next to nothing,
will last, looks nice and, although it
doesn’t fulfil the housing regulations, is
more suitable for the Victorian climate
than the materials which are prescribed
by authority and which nobody can get.
The Digger maintains that if the
authorities who have clamped down on
building weren’t so bound to conventional
notions they would sow crops of oats and
in a few months would have enough
oaten straw to roof all the lidless houses
in the country.— Bumpkin (Vic.).
White Man’s Burden?
The ancient wisecrack of “J.D.” “Leave
the poor devils [natives] alone” (B.
26/2/’47) is something that won’t work
in practice. “J.D.” should know that,
much as he might desire it, the native is
not left alone. The Dutch in 1623 had
instructions to explore the coast of the
“South Land” and “in places where you
meet with people.... by dexterity or
otherwise get hold of some adults, or still
better, young lads or girls.” The object
was, of course, to develop a source of
slave supply. Even as late as the middle
of last century there was an expedition
to Humboldt Bay in New Guinea for
this purpose.
Our own people encouraged the “de-
velopment” of the islands and New
Guinea in the search for pearlshell and
beche-de-mer, gold, sandalwood and>
other things which the native would have
no use for, and bartered bottles (both
empty and full), old guns, hoopiron and
hatchets, calico and other sundries in
their introduction of white culture.
“Blackbirding” was a popular and pay-
able pastime, but it required human
specimens of the inferior races, and hence
again the native discovered that he
couldn’t live in solitude in the South Seas.
When Bligh was assembling
his Tahitian expedition he was
snowed under with applications
for enrolment, the draw being
stories that had come in from
ships visiting that part of the
Pacific, stories of attractive
damsels who could be had for
the asking. And I’ll guarantee
that if a rich gold strike were
made or an oilfield discovered
on native territory “J.D.”
would be as eager as anyone to
develop the show with the
.“assistance of cheap native
labor.”
Admittedly missionary ac-
tivities haven’t always been of
the best, but some of our own
islands off North Australia
have furnished results that
brought tribute from occupa-
tion forces and opened the eyes
of a good many regarding edu-
cational policy of the right
kind. “J.D.’s” allusion to the
slight increase in numbers of
the Marquesans reminds me that in the
Torres Strait group the population has
increased steadily under missionary and
beneficent Government influence —on one
island alone it doubled itself in 20 years.
The native finds that in this fast-
moving world someone is sure to land
in on him, and the best thing is to train
and prepare him for European or other
contact. — Eborac (Tas.).
Wool for Japan
Although Supreme Headquarters ob-
jected to Canberra’s offer to supply only
faulty wools, an order for 7000 bales of
burry merino and crossbred types has
been given to Australia. We owe Japan,
through Supreme H.Q., £468,750 for
post - war shipments of 1270 bales of
silk, and it is presumed these credits will
be paid for in wool. Nippon is very
short of foreign credits, and General
Mac Arthur asked for 120,000 bales of
combing wool suitable for turning into
worsteds and yarns for export.
Ten years ago Japan, was the second-
largest user of Australian wool, and her
annual mill capacity is over 600,000 bales.
No other country has the machinery plus
cheap labor to manufacture at prices to
suit Asiatic pockets. As Supreme H.Q.
handles all transactions and income from
exports, the charge of trading with the ex-
enemy hardly comes into the picture. If
we are to make Japan pay for the costs
of the 8.C.0.F. and later to pay repara-
tions to ex-p.-0.-w. and their dependents,
we’ll have to allow wool to go to Jap-
anese mills. —K. Me. (N.S.W.).
Queensland Sheepmen
Judging by Stamp Office notations on
wool liens handled lately, not many sheep-
men in n.-w., Queensland have been able
to reduce the financial losses inflicted by
the drought of 20 years ago. Their most
disastrous, year was 1926, when the cost
of artificial feeding and other drought
relief put them heavily in debt. With
taxation at anything like present levels
they can never hope to get square out
of profils. Mortgage debts on sheep
properties well-known to me for a life-
time range from £6 (an- exceptional case)
to 225. 9d. per head of sheep which the
properties can normally carry over aver-
age seasons. In all but one of these cases
the properties were owned and run by
men of wide experience who were not
spendthrifts.
Government drought relief is usually
confined to reduction of railage rates for
starving sheep and (rarely) extensions of
leases. These don’t help the small man
much, as money is needed to make use of
the concessions, and he is usually flat
broke before they are offered.
1 know of no industry which calls more
for solid financial reserves than wool-
growing, especially in n.-w. Queensland
with its recurring droughts. Yet since
1915 the prudent grazier has been given
no chance to set aside those reserves. Go
to any of our pastoral towns and you will
find men who once owned pastoral prop-
erties, went broke in droughts and were
forced to take to droving and the like.
That is the fate of too many game men
who give their best yfears to an industry
in which the odds against them are too
heavy.
Surely an intelligent and sympathetic
approach by the Government to drought
relief could better things? A scheme
along the lines of the War Damage Insur-
ance Fund should be practicable. It
would be a huge undertaking, calling for
skilled handling, but We should have no
trouble in firtding the men for the job—
provided, of course, the Government
drops its penchant for appointing political
rejects to important posts. — X. Leckes
(Q-).
Slugged Again
In B.C. (before Chifley) woolgrowers
willingly levied themselves 2s. a bale for
research and publicity. Now they’re
arbitrarily slugged five per cent, on what-
ever the wool brings.
On four bales, part of a 10-bale clip,
the charge is £6 7s. Bd. The charge on
the whole clip will be not less than £l2.
That is not, as Mr. Chifley claimed, some-
thing the grower can well afford —in this
instance it is literally robbing tic widow
and the fatherless.
It is not as though there were the
slightest hope of a refund. We know
what happened to the wool profits a few
months ago. Yet whenever a country
representative tries to discuss producers
claims, the “Labor” Government at Can-
berra moves the gag. We cannot refuse
to pay this tax because we never handle
the money. Some woolgrowers could
afford to hold their wool in their own
sheds, perhaps, but the poor man cannot
do that. The wool is their security, and
it would be a trustful stock and station
firm that would advance money on it if
it were not available for sale. —J. H. W.
(S.A.).
Westralian Election
In an editorial entitled “A Swing” our
only evening newspaper querulously re-
marks :
There has undoubtedly been a substan-
tial swing against Labor. Why? No burn-
ing issue inflaifted the electors. The short-
comings of the Government were not such
as to create hot resentment in the minds of
the people.
Why ! The easy-going Australian has a
notoriously poor memory, but a spate
of misdeeds on the part of a power-mad
Federal “Labor” Government is too fresh
in the memory to be ignored, and Wes-
tralia has shown its metal and temper
at the expense of State “Labor.”
Can we forgive or forget Communist
control, strikes and larrikinism, or don’t
we remember Martens, Forde, Bryson,
Breen and Mountjoy? Isn’t McKell still
rankling in our memories? Are we to
countenance the continued indifference by
“Labor” to the plight of our British kins-
folk? Must we sit idly by in helpless wrath
while gag after gag is applied to every
proposal to send a national gift of food
to starving Britain? Unless the Common-
wealth Government takes full heed of the
writing on the wall it will go the way of
Westralian “Labor.” Black Swan
(W.A.).
Industrial Stagnation
“Hut 60” (B. 12/3/147) is a trifle one-
eyed in his assertion that public servants
generally stand in the way of production.
He should remember that there are thou-
sands of public servants who aren’t privil-
eged bureaucrats—those employed m
scientific, engineering and such branches
are producers in every sense of the worn
and receive lower wages than private
enterprise offers.
Actually, the lamentable brake on pro-
duction at present may be summed up
simply—though we can’t buy as much for
a pound as we could before the war, we
aren’t doing as much for a pound as we
did before the war. The sooner employer
and employee alike awaken to this sig-
nificant and disastrous fact the sooner a
fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay will
be done, and the sooner fair competition
and fair prices will prevail. P. O. Mc-
Cabe (N.S.W.).


T.B. Treatment
With due respect for “Jock’s” medical
knowledge (B. 12/3/’47), I can’t agree
that it is only lack of money that is
preventing the complete eradication of
T.B. from this country. All the hospitals,
sanatoria and pensions in the world
will not be worth two hoots unless we
have adequate medical ability to treat the
disease. Early detection is one thing,
competent handling is another; and are
we assured of that? Take my own case.
After six months’ treatment I was dis-
charged from the R.A.A.F. as a T.B. My
X-ray showed infiltration, and the skin
test was positive, though sputum and
gastric culture tests were negative. In
spite of these latter results I was assured
that after thorough investigation my con-
dition was considered to be tubercular
To confirm that finding I went to a State
clinic. There, upon being X-rayed, I was
told that there was no Pace of T.B. and
that the film showed nothing more than
vascular markings—whatever that might
have meant.
Bewildered by conflicting opinions, I
consulted an accepted authority by whom
I was told that my lung markings were
attributable to antrum seepage. Further,
I was informed that I had developed a
mania for seeing doctors which was not
in my best interests. An E.N.T. consul-
tation and X-ray failed to support the
antrum theory. Over the next six months
I developed the common “chest” symp-
toms of cough, increasing sputum, heavy
night sweats and general fatigue, where-
upon the authority insisted on an antr-um
wash. This was carried out against the
advice of the E.N.T. specialist and again
proved futile. All this was at £2 2s. a
time.
Two months later when my sputum
became bloodstained the authority still
declared that there was no tuberculous
condition, and when an eventual test
showed the sputum to be positive he in-
sisted that it was a recent infection.
Eight months’ further dithering revealed
that I have a large cavity in the area of
the original infection ; consequently two
of the last three years have been spent in
a sanatorium.
The scant knowledge of the average
general practitioner is another point to be
contended with. The number of patients
whose condition is finally diagnosed as
T.B. only after submitting to the tortures
of having their teeth extracted, antrums
washed and tonsils removed should be
ascertained.
There has been a turn for the good,
with chest surgeons returning to Australia
from abroad in reinforcement of thoracic
surgeons—all too few —and sanatorium
staffs, and with younger men, who can
initiate their own moves and know where
to get real knowledge, taking up the
prevention and cure of T.B. as life work.
Ad Rem (Vic.).
Taxation
Taxpayers outside the fixed-income
group have means of escaping taxation
which are not available to wage- and
salary-earners.
“Mixed businesses,” for instance, get
the major portion of the household’s
living requirements from the shelves. The
owner of one of these concerns with a
turnover of, say, £lOO a week, can
lighten his takings considerably and no
amount of investigation could pick it up.
Cafe proprietors, particularly where they
take an active part in the work, can ad-
just cash sales in a way that can never
be traced even by the most astute inves-
tigator.
Small dairymen and poultry-farmers can
sell a lot of stuff privately with no record
whatever of the transaction. The hus-
band often works while the wife and
family carry on this useful source of in-
come. Wheat-farms, too, often sell pri-
vately to buyers who are only too happy
to get the goods without showing their
hand to officialdom. Some graziers, too,
are not averse to trading wool, sheep and
other livestock in restricted quantities for
cash.
Small building contractors undertake
all kinds of jobs for cash, such as fixing
a door, hanging a gate, putting in a win-
dow or painting. The customer is in
many cases a private person who cannot
claim a deduction for the work when
compiling his taxation returns, hence the
transaction disappears.
Taxi-drivers and hotel-keepers have a
wonderful field for making a bit “under
the lap.” And so, of course, have book-
makers.
Any one of the above taxpayers when
submitting taxation returns can claim for
such things as travelling expenses, post-
age, stationery, telephone and other items.
These deductions are often for semi-
private work, and can only be associated
vaguely with the business enterprise. Yet
they become allowable.
On the other side, the fixed income-
earner finds his taxation deducted at the
source with no possibility of evasion.
Of course, there is an “outside” call for
labor, but this field is limited. As a bank-
manager, I know what goes on and feel
that the incidence of taxation has not
been approached in a commonsense way
to give a most-deserving section —the
wage and salary taxpayer—a more equit-
able deal in relation to other taxpayers. —
CB.M. (N.S.W.).
Cost of Education
“1.D.” (B. 12/3/’47) claims that parents
who give “children” over 18 a university
education are “penalised” unless they are
granted a special tax exemption for the
students during the full course. He
would penalise all other parents by mak-
ing them pay increased taxes for which
they would receive no benefit. The Gov-
ernment may “grant” such concessions,
but it is always the people who pay the
bill.
The problem could be solved if the
exemption were treated as a subsidy re-
payable at the end of the course. Such
a scheme operates elsewhere and includes
books and fees. In many cases the sub-
sidy could be advanced by the parents,
to be repaid in due season.
The idea that a student must be en-
tirely supported by Dad and Mum is
ridiculous. Thousands of them put their
long vacations to profitable use and earn
while they learn. I know of one who
worked his way through a medical course
and then through a theological course.
He cracked stones by the roadside during
summer and attended classes during
winter*
It seems only logical that if a “child”
of 18 cannot afford a scholastic dareer
“ Listen, cant you hear something going ‘tick, tick?’ ”
without impoverishing his parents he
should choose some other career which
will enable him to support himself and
at the same time help to balance the
family budget.— Spunk (S.A.).
Precious Dollars
On top of the report that petrol ration-
ing would “go on indefinitely,” a “news”
item from Canberra stated: “The
Government is now working closely with
the British Government on the dollar con-
servation plan, and has decided on the
tightening up of petrol usage in prefer-
ence to adopting, for the time being at
any rate, more dollar economies.”
By aspersion, the Government is
attempting to cast blame on the long-
suffering motorist for excessive dollar
usage. Yet, without the grace to blush,
the same Government has ordered five
spanking new 40-seat Convair 240-pas-
senger airliners from America, which
will cost many thousands of those precious
dollars each. That in the face of Britain’s
desperate struggle to retrieve economic
stability by exporting everything from
beef extract to aeroplanes.
The Government airline (Trans-Aus-
tralia Airways) has any one of half a
dozen British aircraft to chose from, in-
cluding the Handley-Page Hermes, the
Avro Tudor II and the Airspeed Ambas-
sador, which more than match the per-
formance of the Convair. Any of those
manufacturers’ names has an unforget-
table link with the Battle for Britain, and
their planes have proved themselves in
war theatres the world over.
Here is a chance to practice economy
instead of preaching it, and without
penalising the motorist —who doesn’t buy
more gallons of petrol at today’s prices
than he has to. —A. J. M. (Vic.).
Wheatgrower in Revolt
We recently received from the Wheat
Industry Stabilisation Committee a bunch
‘of instructions as to the various forms, of
various colors, which we are supposed to
fill in before being allowed to grow an
acre of wheat. Here is our reply:
On a visit to see what progress my
sons were making with their rehabilitation,
unaided by the Government, I was sur-
prised and disgusted to find that, after the
rejection of the referendum regarding
primary-products control, your committee
was still operating. In spite of Federal
legislation purporting to control these
matters, there has been a failure of the
States to support such control, and I am
writing you to know if you can inform
me on what authority you issue the per-
mits enclosed with your note.
I note you have various colored forms
and you won’t issue permits under certain
circumstances. It is my considered opinion
that the Government, through you, has no
longer any right to attempt to control the
sowing of any crop I or my sons desire to
grow on our property, and 1 do not pro-
pose to do anything further as regards per-
mits, nor to sell through you or the Wheat
Board. lam sick and tired of the as-
sumption of power by both this Govern-
ment and the upstart departments sup-
ported by it in the face of the expressed
disapproval of the electors. I intend to
grow what I wish, when I wish, 4he sea-
sons permitting. Your committee is only
another pest added to the many with which
I have had to contend through the years,
and I have no more intention of bowing
the head to you than I have done to
droughts, grasshoppers, rabbits, worms,
fluke, blowflies, footrot, rust, flagsmut and
take-all.
If you think that I intend either my sons
or myself to grow wheat for the benefit
of the present bureaucracy, who illegally
sell something which does not belong to
them to a sympathetic Government in
another ill-governed country at a price
ridiculously below world’s parity, you are
mistaken.
We intend to grow the amount of wheat
dictated by the probable price, the season
and our inclination, and sell it on the
open market. If you or the Government
or the Wheat Board or someone else of
whom I have not yet heard have the power
to stop us I suppose we will hear from
you in some form or other. No doubt the
powers will attempt to use coercion by the
railways and/or the Road Transport
Board, and perhaps the Shipping Control,
to prevent us from disposing of the pro-
ducts of our land and labor to a starving
European population, but that will be for
the future to determine.
As regards the crop harvested from the
1946 sowing, this has been placed privately,
without recourse to either your department
or the Wheat Board or the Government.
We can only hope that this may stir
public and farmers out of their apathy.—
G. O. R. (N.S.W.).
Pearling
“Yagoo” (B. 19/3/ ’47) apparently
views pearling conditions from a beach-
comber’s point of view and is unfamiliar
with the deep-sea industry. White men
do not act as divers as a rule; deep-sea
shell is not found on reefs ; work con-
ditions do not involve union hours for
labor, and operations are not subject to
tide conditions except when water is
clouded through sea movement.
A few years before the war pearling
was carried out under the control of
Australians, generally as a company
operating a fleet of luggers, with an
auxiliary schooner to supervise activities.
In every instance shell-opening was per-
formed by trustworthy Australians on the
lookout for occasional pearls. Other
members of the crew —six of them —were
all foreigners, mostly Malays, Manilla-
men and Japanese obtained under con-
tract from an agency at Singapore. Divers
were regarded as specialists and re-
ceived extra pay on the basis of shell
obtained in a season. It was called their
“lay” and usually amounted to about
£25 a ton. As a good diver could usually
bring up about five tons in the nine
months’ season he thus collected about
£125, as well as his wages and keep.
Some years ago it was estimated that
cost for wages, food and odd repairs to
a lugger amounted to about £360 for a
season, so that the whole amount, ip-
eluding the diver’s “lay,” came to only
£485. Present-day costs would be much
higher, but so also is the market value
of shell —now £6OO a ton. Even if costs
have doubled or trebled the season’s
profit is good and there is always the
chance of obtaining valuable pearls.
Control of the business should defin-
itely be in the hands of Australians, and
native labor should be arranged by con-
tract. The “opener” of shell is actually
the “skip” and manages the outfit. The
diver works to no specified schedule —
sometimes he toils from daylight to dark,
with breaks for rest and refreshment.
As a rule there is no work on Saturday
afternoons and Sundays. Frequently
a lugger is at sea for a whole month, re-
turn to shore being necessary at times
for water or fuel, though provisions are
generally supplied by the auxiliary
schooner.
For the white man the work is tedious
and lonely, though not necessarily ardu-
ous, and it would be even less attractive
if the lugger were operating on its own.
Government assistance for individual en-
terprise would not be feasible, but under
group conditions with suitable manage-
ment the scheme should be very lucrative
for a number of ex-servicemen—acting as
openers and controllers who are not’
afraid of adventurous life under rough
conditions. —C. Turner (N.S.W.).
Widows’ Pensions
“T.M.S(B. 12/3/’47) asks why there
should be such a difference between the
pensions of war widows and those of
civilian widows.
Jones and Smith lived in the same
street. Jones went to the front and left
his wife lonely and anxious. He was*
poorly paid and fed, constantly in danger,
often in pain, occasionally tortured and
starved. His one sustaining comfort was
the knowledge that in the event of his
death his wife would be supported by
his country. Fighting for his countfy and,
incidentally, for Smith and Smith’s wife,
he died a violent death, thus paying the
highest life-insurance premium possible.
Smith stayed at home and got a good
job with higher pay, because the absence
of Jones and thousands of others like him
had created a shortage of manpower. He
enjoyed the comforts of home life with
his wife for company. From some cause
he died a natural death, surrounded by
friends and receiving the best medical
attention. Neither he nor his wife had
sacrificed anything for their country be-
yond the common round and daily task.
Both these men may have been equally
brave and willing. Their wives may have
been equally virtuous and patriotic. The
fact remains that one man fulfilled a cer-
tain contract with onerous conditions,
while the other did not. Would the
civilian widow change places and condi-
tions as well as pensions with the war
widow?—A. S. A- (S.A.).
The Blue Lake
“H.A.L.” (B. 5/3/’47) makes some very
erroneous comments about the Blue
Lake at Mount Gambier (S.A.). No color
film of the Blue Lake has been an-
nounced, but a color film of the district
has been taken by the Una Daniell 16mm. ,
Productions, Ltd., and of course in-
cludes shots of the Blue Lake. This
production is a credit to the producer
and should please and interest all who
see it.
“H.A.L.,” by his own statements, has
only seen the Blue Lake in the dead of
winter, and in pouring rain.
The average tourist from overseas,
many of whom have visited this town,
is amazed at the marvellous color of
the lake. I could quote complimentary
remarks from tourists from various parts
of the world, including Iraq, China,
U.K., New Guinea, Thursday Island,
South Africa, Egypt, Maoriland, U.S.A.,
and from every State in the Common-
wealth.
The blue of this lake is unbelievable
and occurs every year without fail, usu-
ally at the end of November or the begin-
ning of December, although last year the
annual miracle did not take place until
December 26. This color only lasts about
three months —December, January, and
February. A reprint of an official des-
cription by an artist may give some idea
of the color;
Yesterday the Blue Lake became far
more beautiful than any tourist poster yet
painted. Perhaps the most beautiful view
was from the eastern side of the John
Watson Drive, where the sun gave the
sombre mount in the background a golden
sheen’and the s.teep banks of the Blue Lake,
olive green with touches of yellow, swept
down to the bright cerulean blue water, so
opaque that it appeared almost as a huge
block of blue ice. The edges were slightly
transparent and green. The only breaks
in the surface appeared when an occasional
wisp of wind broke the water into silvery
ripples.
If “H.A.L.” cares to supply his name
and address I’ll send or lend him some
natural color transparencies, and will also
wire him when the annual miracle takes
place so that he can see for himself. For
general information, the glorious color of
the first transformation does not last all
the year but gradually becomes a deeper
blue until the middle of winter, when
it changes to a deep steely-blue or a
leaden-grey.—J. M. (S.A.).
