The Red Page
The Next German War
The German didn’t wait to be beaten to
prepare plans for his next campaign. He
knew that, win or lose in the appeal to
arms, the second campaign was coming:
and by 1915 he was assured that be would
not be able to impose his will absolutely.
Therefore lie had to provide for overcoming
the bate which he knew was awaiting him.
To have hope for the future—r-that is, hope
of World Dominion —he knew that he must
devise means of maintaining a large popula-
tion in Germany; and that meant an export
trade partly in order to pay for raw pro-
ducts which the country had to import and
partly to pile up internal wealth for future
contingencies. How to secure a great export
trade in the face of the general hate was the
problem for the other campaigners—the men
who could not do their part in field-grey.
The Future of German Industrial Exports,
written late in 1915 by S. Herzog, a German
engineer, and now published in an English
translation, is one of the contributions to the
study. It comes with an introduction by 11.
C. Hoover and others from Doubleday, Page
and Co., of New York.
The writer is not troubled with any foolish
moral scruples. Germany has to be set on
top; and all is fair in that fight. As for
treaties—piff! “He who would keep treaties
does not need them ; he who chances them —-
takes his chances.” No matter what the
peace treaty might say, Germany must not
build upon it. She must trust to no scraps
of paper to make her sovereignty sure.
“They will hate us,” says Ilertzog in effect
—“what then? Shall our manufacturers
transplant themselves?” To that comes a
thunderous “No!” Transplanting, above ’all
things, Germany must prevent. Yet if the
manufacturer remains in Germany his out-
put will be shunned.
The usual way of making goods known to a
broader circle is to cal', attention to tile name of
the firm, location and its trade-mark. Such adver-
tising will have anything but a commendatory effect
upon the formerly hostile nations, at least for a con-
siderable time after the conclusion of peace. The
mere fact that the goods were shipped from Germany
will be a drawback if it is made known. We willj
of course, cease to give conspicuousness to the
German character of export products. Judging,
however, by various indications in hostile newspapers,
we must reckon upon the use of apparently harmless
but actually malicious tricks to discriminate against
German goods.
To prevent the Customs people adopting the
“malicious trick” of branding the goods with
the name of the gentle Hun, the German
State must arrange for goods to be sent in
vast quantities to some other national’s port
for shipment ; and Holland is very handy. If
that doesn’t serve, "then denationalisation of
goods should not be avoided.” Hertzog, as
he writes, hears some old Herr protesting
that this sort of thing is “incompatible with
the German character.” “My dear sir,” he
replies, “it is really not a deception at all.
German goods are so vastly superior to all
other goods that they ‘bear within them their
stamp of origin as clear as day to the experi-
enced user.’ ” And then, having finished giv-
ing his humbugging answer to the old Herr,
he takes his tongue from his cheek and is
his old self again. “Sentimental considera-
tions can find no place in mercantile life.”
In plainer English : “No lying, no dishonesty,
is to be jibbed at if it will help us to collar
the trade of Australia and other insufficiently
protected countries.” And besides, if Ger-
man manufacturers had any qualms about
lying and dishonesty, they must remember
that they could reform in time to escape
eternal damnation. “We must not forget
that, at the worst, we are only dealing with
a period of transition. After it has passed
dollars-and-eents reasoning will be superior
In the dictates of emotion.” He knows the'
importer pretty well. Yet he might go even
further. The Red Page sees the time coming
when, in certain shops, goods will be dis-
played : “German-make —At Special Reduc-
tions to Get Rid of Them.” And most likely
they will not be German goods'at all.
Meantime the Hun knows that for the big
trade of the world he will have to fight as he
never fought before; and not only because of
the hate, but because also of American com-
petition—and Hertzog would have mentioned
Japan too if he had written two or three
years later:
For the enormous ’profits which the American
factories reap through their unscrupulous production
of war materials, enable them to wipe out liabilities
in a way hitherto considered impossible. These
profits constitute reserves which they can fall back
upon with full assurance when striving to outbid
others.
The means to meet and overcome this com-
petition for the export trade to places like
Australia are discussed at great length.
The fight is to begin in the schools. “Then
in manufacture and industry we must take
care in future to use foreign languages in the
native way. Attention should be paid to
this subject in the schools.” If a State shuts
out German goods, then Germany must re-
taliate by forbidding export of those German
articles—it may be few —which are indis-
pensable to that State. (But our Hertzog
forgot that lesson he taught us about de-
nationalisation ! Must the boycotted State
buy 'the few indispensables direct from
Germany?) And on top of a State-organised
system of bonuses and subventions and
assistance in keeping plant up to date there
must be a guarantee fund. Out of this
guarantee fund are to be paid the costs of
killing any insufficiently-protected industry
in a foreign country:
The German industrial enterpriser will under-
stand how to turn out the surplus stock to the
amount demanded by the State without further
directions if the State gives him the necessary
guarantees of sale and assists him financially. . . .If
industries need the cost of their raw materials re-
duced, in order to enable them to sell at better
[lower] prices, the general guarantee fund could
take care of that. Even in that worst case of all,
where auxiliary industries had to supply materials
for this purpose at a loss to themselves, they would
still be supported by the general guarantee fund,
thus being assured a proper percentage of profit.
Export premiums, freight rebates, etc., in amounts
determined by the price difference to be equalised,
will suffice in most cases.
And so Hertzog goes on to set out and dis-
cuss the schemes that were in the mind of
the German generals who have the direction
of the new campaign which has precisely
the same objective as the old campaign.
Hoover and his colleagues in their foreword
remind us that just the same sort of litera-
ture was available regarding the old cam-
paign ; “but civilisation turned a deaf ear,
and is now paying the penalty.” They call
on the freed nations to be wiser this time
and apply the antidote. In Australia the
opportunity will come very quickly. A new
tariff, the only trustworthy safeguard, will
be under discussion during the session which
has just opened.
Repington of “The Times”
If you want to know something about the
British Army as it was in the years before
the great war you can profitably read Ves-
tigia, by Lieut.-Golonel Charles a Court
liepington (Constable .and Co., London).
You will find even the history of the family
there and a description of the mansion in
which it lived, so that you may the better
judge of the kind of man who became an
officer and the handicaps under which the
whole system moved. You will find in the
book, the story of the Kliyber Pass, of the
Omdurman campaign and of a portion of
the South African struggle. Seen from the
inside, with the eyes of a staff-officer, the
calamities of Spion Kop and the other fights
in the neighborhood leave the reader won-
dering at the amazing incompetence of the
G.O.C. This passage gives some idea of
the conduct of the war:
There was no plan except that we were to take
the hill and stay there. Some 1700 men were to
assault a hill 1740 ft. high in the centre of the
Boer position, and the rest of Buffer's 20,000 men
were to look on and do nothing. Spion Kop was
a perfectly-open dominating height, exposed to lire
from every Boer gun in the field, and though its
attempted capture as a part of a general plan of
attack was legitimate and perhaps necessary, this
was not true of it as an isolated act. Unable or
unwilling to launch their troops in a general attack
at dawn, which would in my opinion have succeeded,
our generals decided upon Spion Kop as a make-
believe of energy and decision. It was the old, the
fatal, story of “If we fail we can’t lose many men.”
The “generals” here really means Buffer,
for we read earlier that the position of
supremacy be occupied made protests diffi-
cult, and that lie lived apart from his staff
with his military secretary. The impres-
sion is given throughout that nobody knew
much about what was going .on, that when
great opportunities offered they were missed,
and that even when there was something
attempted it was half-hearted and pre-
doomed to failure;
The book contains three letters written
by the Kaiser, one the famous letter to
Tweedmouth in which he tried to influence
the British naval estimates, and two of a
more intimate character to Sir E. Sullivan.
The first of these two refers to the Jameson
raid:
Your society people and others do not know that
for the last two years Transvaal and the German
interests have been the cause of very intense-political
correspondence between Downing-street and Berlin.
Over and over again it - has been shown that the
large amount of German capital in Transvaal (over
300 millions) and nearly 20,000 German inhabitants
bad to be respected and were to be looked after
from here. This Downing-street never quite acknow-
ledged. Your people not knowing these precedents
took my dispatch for a nasty slap from somebody
who seemed their friend till now. Whereas it was
the thankful outcry that our men and money had
been saved from loss and ruin! The more so as
your Government and mine are quite d’accord about
what to think of Jameson and his marauders. After
all, the commandment “Thou shalt not steal” is
also written for Britons as well as for other people?)
Never did I fanny that Englishmen arid lots of
officers were among the people who refused to obey
IJ.M. commands to return. I thought that it was
a pack of gold-diggers, who generally are known as
the scum of all nations I
Another letter is concerned chiefly with the
sailing of ships. The Yampa, “one of the
finest, schooners afloat, which was built in
America and now belongs to my wife,” had
just made a record trip across the Atlantic.
The letter concludes:
The political outlook is on the whole not bad;
only your “Brummagem Joe” seems to take up “little
wars” by the dozen, and I venture to think that
Britannia has quite enough on heri hands with the
utterly useless Afridi war, which hasnot had the
effect expected, and a new Expedition to the Sudan,
where, she well may suddenly meet beside the Maluli,
Menelik of Abissinian “Connaissanee” and France for
ought that I know! Perhaps that your Press then
suddenly will find out that after all the German
Emperor is worth while thinking of?)
The capitals, the spelling and the punctua-
tion are the Kaiser’s.
No. one could pretend that Repington’s
book is a remarkable, contribution to litera-
ture ; but it is the honest record of the
life a.nd observation of a not undistinguished
Englishman. . Some of it is of value to the
future historian; much of it is of interest
to the ordinary student of affairs. In 1911
Eepington, in four articles in The Times,
gave definitely the reasons why Germany
would violate the neutrality of Belgium.
The line of argument made no impression
on the authorities; but the conclusions were
correct. A man who can make a forecast of
that sort deserves a hearing.
The Advantage of Being a Dog
P. Horne Macdonald, M. 8., Ch.B. (St.
And.), in a book on air-borne diseases
(Whitcombe and Tombs, M.L.), offers a
new cure for ’flu. About the success of his
system he has no doubt:—
Of the many nurses employed, though they were
mostly untrained persons, only one contracted the
disease, and she had candidly failed to appreciate
instructions. In type her illness was pneumonic.
The treatment is nothing more than the
cleaning of the back of the tongue with a
brush, That is the secret of avoiding air-
borne diseases and the way to get rid of
them even after they have secured a hold.
And the biological explanation looks con-
vmemg enough. The human diseases of
® kind would not occur if we crawled on
all-fours. Through the erect posture, the
tongue, the dust-catcher and protector of
the body, drains back into the throat in-
stead of forward to the tip as in the case of
animals. Nature, by the animal posture,
provided against air infection, while man
by defying nature and standing upright, has
made himself liable to them. The author
maintains that manv other diseases, such as
measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, diphtheria
ana infantile paralysis, can be avoided in

“We want facts about your roofing, not generalities. Prove that its use saves
us money and wb’ll ' buy it.’' That was the cry from shrewd men when
Adamax Pooling was first introduced.
We gave them FACTS —we told them that:—
ADAMAX ROOFING
Resists the Elements
that rain, heat, cold, wind, gases, chemical fumes or acids, etc., do not affect it:
that it is made from long-fibred felt, thoroughly impregnated with pure mineral hydro-carbon, and
finished by a process which makes it timeproof:
that it saves in the cost of roofing, because it can be laid flat, the edges being cemented with Adamax
Pooling Cement. This saves roofing timbers and time taken in roofing buildings, etc.
To-day Adamax Roofing is admitted “The Best that Money can buy.”
Learn the full facts. They are given in our FREE PAMPHLET. Send for copy now; also for a
sample.

Fellowship.
Who hath not walked abroad and, musing,
heard.
Deep in the shaded wood the piping bird,
Or turned and listened, silent, till it seemed
He felt the earth slow-breathing where it
dreamed ;
Who hath not seen new-webbed upon the
g-rqen
The spider’s silken knot, and touched the
thread
With reverent fingers and low-bending head.
Feeling that He with this frail thing had
been ;
And hath not felt Him in the quiet hour,
Nor heard His footstep where the wistful
tree
Answers the wandering winds in melody,
Nor marked the midgling utter forth His
power?
When He comes gathering in this scattered
host,
How strange will such one feel, how lone,
how lost!

Trees sleep; the moonlight’s breath is stayed.
The lock turns soft, the carpet laid

Glooms like the Pathway of Despair.

Returned.
Whispering winds in the starlight,
All sweet with clean scent of brown loam ;
Faint white of a tent ’mid the frondage
Of bracken like delicate foam—
Here in freedom from all save the bondage
Of nature, and under God’s dome,
We rest who have followed a far light,
And tracked it safe home.
The woe of the world and its w r onder
And horror, by dark and by day,
We have known, as sad France in her sorrow
New-moulded us, clay of her clay:
Sad France, the dawu-fiame of man’s Morrow
Flares bold, but her ashes are gray
O’er her sons, who sleep silent thereunder,
In stillness for aye !
Strained eyes that grow 7 heavy with horror,
Lean hands that are knotted with pain,
Sick hearts that seek only forgetting,
War-weary in body and brain —
We have turned from the grays of regretting
To the lights and the loves that remain,
And the Bush what we sacrificed for her
Will render again.
Shy. tender and mystical lover,
Whose love is the sw 7 eet of surcease.
By light youth as lightly forsaken
Till the years and the shadows increase;
When by shade of gray years overtaken
Her favors, grown fairer, we lease,
In the rose of her lips we discover
The petals of peace.
The silver of stars, and the quiet
Sweet breath of the tropical night,
With warm fires of eve’s pulseless planet,
Steal soft over senses and sight,
And, veiling the past, seem to ban it,
Far flame of a meteor’s flight,
To sink and be lost down the sky it
Made lurid with light..
Down the lofty bush aisles, the green bracken
Awakes as the vmnder-wind blows,
To murmur “Your roaming is over,
With its glories and glamors and woes” ;
And the faint airs breathe fragrant wdth
clover,
Past the slopes where pale wattle-flame
glows •
An! all pulses of life ebb and slacken
To Nature’s repose.
Our tents glimmer w 7 hite in the starlight
’Mid the bracken like emerald foam ;
Around and above us move flying
Frail night-moths, that circle and roam;
Here in peace, only stirred by the sighing
Of questing winds under God’s dome.
We rest who have followed a far light
And tracked it safe home.

Remonstrance.
When Love in virgin hopes was yonng
And all untarnished by life’s stress,
Our double nassion lightly flung
A melody of tenderness
Into our lives: it echoes yet
In cadences of soft regret.
Oh, we had days of blue and gold,
When ev’ry sunny hour was sweet
With ecstasies that would unfold,
Like fairy flowers, around our feet,
In that dreamland in which we moved
Together, love by loving proved.
’Twas here our loveland stood: here, still.
The prospect stretches sweetly fair.
A storm has passed beyond the hill
And sullen clouds still linger there.
But must we hold, with peevish tears,
The sullen thoughts of parted years?
The storm has passed ! Dear, do we need
To nurse the hurts its anger gave.
Since sunny hours again succeed?
Let the clouds go! From shore and wave
Nought that is beautiful has fled:
Your lips—your still-young lips—are red !
Still all our present joys may bless
The hunger of our hours of tears,
While kisses give forgetfulness
Of wrongs endured in darker years,
In joyous wisdom storm survives
To keep our love-song in our lives!

THE NATION THAT WORKS AND THE
NATION THAT ARGUES.
The Weimar correspondent of London
Daily Chronicle reported last week that
the orthodox Socialist revolution in Germany
had definitely failed. “Now,” he said, “it
is almost as though the November revolu-
tion had never been.... Germany is in-
capable of revolution .” All German history
supports his view. The upheaval of 1830
was a mild affair which faded out the
moment Saxony, Brunswick, Hanover and
Hesse-Cassel were assured of certain re-
forms : the riots of 1848 were more serious—
about as much so as the sgcent Spartacist
trouble. Germany was divided at this
period into two bitterly hostile parties, _ one
Austrian, the other Prussian; and yet within
20 years the nation was united enough to
defeat France —then, reputedly, the strongest
military country in the world. To-day Ger-
many is united by the firm bonds of present
humiliation and prospective revenge. The
war appears to have reacted on the orderly
and disciplined German temperament in a
peculiar manner. The Junker class has
become socialised, and the social democracy
nationalised. Every message which has come
to us from Germany since the occupation
points to the fact that the food which the
Allies are now pouring into the country is
the one thing needed to bring the Hun
worker and the great Hun cartels together
in "conciliatory frame of mind, and to
turn the eyes of all ranks in the direction
of a reconstructed monarchy. To work 'hard
and to be bossed, individually by an official,
collectively by a semi-lunatic who claims to
do it by Divine right—that is the German
way ; and a very effective way it is from the
standpoint of productivity and every other
form of national effort.
* * * *
What has Australia to set against German
unity and orderliness? The question is to
the point since the Commonwealth wfill boom
or burst as a manufacturing nation—in
other words, it will live or die- —according
as it is able to compete against strenuous
and highly-organised rivals. It has a so-
called Protective tariff which is doing little
or nothing to prevent the arrival of tons of
Japanese and Yankee goods now, and which
will ofesently let in a flood of German manu-
factures. The tariff may be raised. • But
there remains an industrial problem which
is less easy to dispose of. Before the war
Labor, generally, stood for State socialism;
Conservatism for the blessedness of private
enterprise. Labor was all for Parlia-
mentary government on the widest franchise,
and Toryism was understandably tepid on
the question. The War Precautions Act,
idiotically maladmrnistered in almost every
department, gradually satisfied even the most
passionate democrat of the pre-war school
that State interference was capable of being
overdone. The extreme Tory, on the other
hand, discovered virtues in the system of
which he had not so much as dreamed pre-
viously. In the opinion of the type of citi-
zen who is to-day represented by such papers
as Sydney Worker, the State is a maleficent
entity which, like “the exploiter” (or per-
son with money), calls ceaselessly upon the
community to nroduce —in plain, coarse lan-
guage to work. The war being over, a
number of folks who did nothing to help
win it seem to think that Australia should
now sit down and loaf on the proceeds.
This section, jettisoning the teachings of
such one-time idols as Sorel, has got back to
the exploded Tom Mann theory that the
way to make employment general is for each
man to do as little as possible. The em-
ployer naturally regards this view as the
equivalent of national insanity, and suicide —
which indeed it is. Extremists in both
camps are pretty well agreed on one matter,
and that is the futility of Parliaments. The
Conservatives always held the view that such
places were “talking-shops” at the best, and
institutions for the legalisation of robbery at
the worst. Our syndicalists now take the
same standpoint. Parliaments, as a matter
of fact, are opposed to the very basis of
their doctrine. They imply a reasoned
effort to get at the will of the majority re-
gardless of class; and without the “class-
war” battle-axe the syndicalist, campaigner
is weaponless. The Direct Actionists pro-
pose to get their requirements, not from any
Parliament, but by that which Germany “is
incapable of,” namely, Revolution. They
are individualists as intolerant and as pre-
datory as the capitalists whom they denounce.
* * ■* *
Such is one aspect of the aftermath of
war so far as Australia is concerned. Our
Junkers have not become socialised; many
of them have learnt nothing at all. And a
portion of the country’s social democracy
has abandoned nationalism in favor of a
form of internationalist anarchy. If the
Commonwealth is to nold its own against
outside competition it will obviously have to
reconcile these warring elements. More
State Socialism isn’t going to do it- State
railways and Commonwealth shipf? have
their obvious advantages, but the State can
be no more generous or considerate as an
employer than anyone else if it is to remain
solvent. Also, on the personal side, State
bosses can be as exasperating and as tyran-
nical as private-enterprise ones, as all who
had to do with a Government department
during the war will agree. Weak-kneed
pliancy in face of preposterous demands
made by agitators in the hope that they will
be rejected won’t help in the long run. The
first principle of syndicalism is to ask and
ask until the limit is reached, and then to
use refusal as a justification of violence.
The policy is being followed by the seamen’s
bosses at this moment. It is questionable if
arbitration, as it exists at present, will be
efficacious to settle the most delicate and
difficult cases. Arbitration Courts are
always liable to become distrusted by the
party which' has the bulk of adverse de-
cisions registered against it;-and, anyhow,
they suffer from the handicaps which all
overburdened central administrations labor
under. Probably the likeliest way out is,
while retaining all our existing institutions
for the minimising of industral unrest, to
foster wherever possible the adoption of
some form of the Whitley scheme, which
in N. S. Wales the Board of Trade has been
trying to popularise. The Australian worker
showed himself in warfare to be particularly
suited for it. He jibbed at nothing where
a feasible reason was advanced why it should
be done, and the essence of the Wtiitley
scheme is reasonableness. It is plainly a
good thing, in the case of parties who are
anxious for a fair deal, to have joint, discus-
sions, whether on wages or conditions or
anything else. It may be that nothing in
the world will entirely stop strikes and
industrial litigation, but frequent meetings
between employers and employed must do
a lot, if only by the agency of the human
touch. One certainty is that some addi-
tional measures will have to be taken to do
away with the industrial and social bitter-
ness which is menacing every form of in-
dustrv. A country that wastes its time
listening to, arguing with, and occasionally
prosecuting blitherers of the Le CoßNtr and
Walsh breed, instead of trying to devise
means whereby the ill-feeling on which such
men batten may be removed, can never pre-
vail under modern world-conditions. Its
place in the industrial race is back among
the lotus-eaters of Southern Europe.
MAKING WORK FOR THE PEOPLE.
Nothing is more unanimous in politics than
the unanimity about “the duty of the Gov-
ernment to find work for the people,”
especially the returned soldiers. Even the
agreement that it is the duty of the Opposi-
tion to organise strikes and stop work as
soon as it is found isn’t in the same street
with it, for there are dissenters from the
latter proposition, while the former is
carried nem. con. And it seems to be agreed
that a Government can find work only in
one way—by spending money, which is
borrowed money in 99| cases out of 100, on
some job which stops short as soon as it is
finished, and is finished as soon as the loan
money gives out. Premier Holman, as head
of the State with the biggest population and
the biggest revenue and the biggest debt, has
naturally the most plans on hand. One is
a gigantic water conservation scheme in the
North to supply power for secondary in-
dustries. When it is finished no one expects
that there will be, under the present order
of things, any secondary industries worth
mentioning to use the power. Sydney stands
in the middle and Newcastle stands towards
one end of the biggest known coalfield in
the Southern Hemisphere, and for many
years they have possessed the cheapest coal-
power in the whole world. Yet they have
failed even to run the secondary industry o c
making their own matches, thanks to the
insane effort to pay 70s. for a 48-hours week
and still compete under a low tariff with
people who are content with 15s. for an
84-hours week. Then there is a stupendous
project for building houses —millions and
millions of pounds’ worth of houses —to put
unemployed soldiers in. When they are
built the work will stop, and unless con-
tinuous and self-supporting employment is
found for the tenants the houses will put
things no further forward than the vast
hydro-electric works which are to furnish
power to drive the machines we haven’t got.
Next there is talk of building the long-
postponed bridge over Sydney Harbor, which
will furnish much honest toil for a while and
supply an urgent and long-felt want. But
the toil will stop short some day, and,
though the bridge will throw a few ferry
employees out of work, it will furnish not
one penn’orth of continuous or productive
job for the folk who walk over it. Likewise
it is intended, as a massive and courageous
move, to find works for a few clerks in a
new State office which will insure men
against being loose on the labor market and
pay them while loose. But this won’t pro-
vide the men with work. It is merely a case
of a few salaried clerks taking a middle-
man’s percentage off the dry bones of a land
in which jobs are few ; and the fewer jobs
there are the more clerks will be busy in-
suring those who haven’t got them.
» « * *
As a matter of course it is pointed out
that if the Federal capital is built with
great energy and much loan money at
Canberra, the building of it will engage a
lot of soldiers at good loan wages for a long
while. The same might be said of a pyramid
or the Tower of Babel, though they weren’t
built with loans. But when the Canberra
city is constructed the job will end —after
the fashion of the hydro-electric scheme and
the houses and the bridge. The workers
will be as workless as before. Nobody even
hints that the wonderful Capital in Two
Pieces has any manufacturing possibilities
to support it. .coal and iron and water-power
being ail lacking; or any agricultural, possi-
bilities, being sheep land in a region of
deficient rainfall; or facilities for land com-
merce, being on a branch line off a branch
line which doesn’t pay; or special facilities
for the small shore fragment
of it being 130 miles from the big dry frag-
ment. In other words, it isn’t expected to
supply permanent, productive, self-support-
ing vrork, but is to be a place that will have
to be supported. Following the same line
of thought, the leader of the Labor Opposi-
tion in N. S. Wales talks of creating 2000
miles, or some such immensity, of light rail-
ways at the cheap rate of £2OOO per mile.
The cheapest railway ever built by the State
Government cost more than that, and it
happened whep wages and materials were
cheap; and how the community could hope
to drag a profit out of a sudden addition of
50 per cent, to its mileage no one can say.
’There is no suggestion about creating any
industries to employ the lines. But like the
building of pyramids or temples they would
keep a lot of people busy while the show
endured and leave them older and more
unfit for a frekh start when it gave out.
All the State Governments propose, even
apart from extraordinary and heroic schemes
like John Storey’s, to spend very large
sums on public works generally. And behind
all is the stereotyped, invariable, inescapable
proposition that people shall be “put on the
jand.” Putting a person on the land is
getting rid of him for the time being. It is
sending him to a distance, and is another
form of shoving him out of the door. Being
on the land is no more a remunerative occu-
pation in itself than being in a hole or a
quandary or up a tree. Further, in Queens-
land, N. S. Wales and the Northern Ter-
ritory it is proposed to send soldiers out
prospecting for minerals, for which Aus-
tralia has been for the most part well
combed already. This employment will last
as long as the subsidies last.
* «• * *
Some energetic persons started the making
of hand-woven tweeds in a small way for
the benefit of damaged soldiers, and were
actually paying good wages and showing a
small surplus. It was suggested that the
Government should support the experiment
by getting it —for payment, not by way of
charity—an adequate supply of yarn, and
possibly advancing as much money as would
suffice to put six soldiers on dry farms.
The idea was scoffed at and discouraged on
the ground that it was a small business and
“led nowhere.” In the matter of being small
at the beginning it was in the same category
as the Bank of N. S. Wales, which started
in two wooden rooms, or the A.M.P. Society,
which commenced with the loan of a little
petty cash and not a solitary customer. As
for leading nowhere, there was no evidence
that it wouldn’t lead to big factories cover-
ing a dozen acres eaeh; for universal pro-
videries, run by importers, aren’t the only
things that are liable to grow. Measuring
things by its imports Australia has. even with
its present population, easily £60,000,000
worth of work to offer every year to re-
turned soldiers and others. This is work
that we know to be waiting. Also we know
it to be payable unless it is run by fools
and incapables. for other people make it pay
and we pay other people for doing it. That
insanity must be ended before there is any
hope for us. With the work available here
which we now send out of the country vote-
hungry politicians would find it no longer
profitable to offer poor muck-shifting jobs
on a colossal scale. And for such jobs as
they did offer there would be vastly more
justification than there is to-day. Holman’s
North Coast hydro-electric scheme would be
a perfectly good scheme if behind it were
the same sort of tariff that stood behind the
scheme for harnessing the power that roars
over Niagara. Even some of John Storey’s
railways would not be so conspicuously
foolish if there was a population here large
enough to do all the jobs which for want of
a sufficient tariff we now send away for
Others to do.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Various Kinds of Australian.
From the first day that the Australians
appeared at the battle front they won golden
opinions for their courage, tneir humanity,
their cheerfulness in the most cheerless cir-
cumstances, their tenacity, and, above all,
their resourcefulness. They were all “storm
troops.” They found out new ways of doiug
old things, and thereby achieved what looked
like impossibilities. On more than one occa-
sion they managed with little loss to take
positions which officers, accustomed to rou-
tine soldiers, hesitated to attack because,
though they had little doubt about success,
the prize seemed hardly worth the price in
human life. An uncanny gift for doing
wonders with inadequate materials was the
outstanding characteristic of the Australian
when he was under leaders like Monash,
and away from the deadening influence and
cast-iron discipline of his industrial bosses
and the poisonous atmosphere of loans and
Freetrade. In peace time and in his own
country he bears quite a different character.
He is above all things the man who can’t
do things. He has developed a nation which
believes it can’t buy its crust and butter
without the aid of loans; can’t makes its
own clothes out of its own wool; can’t make
its own ships, machinery, telegraph wire,
steel rails, rolling stock, telephones, matches,
pipes, pianos, tooth-brushes, thread, pins,
paper, women’s hats, or almost anything
else, and which thinks itself unable tq grow
its own cotton or sufficient sugar for' itself.
It imports many of its Labor-stopping
leaders on the principle that it can’t produce
even them. A fairly large part of it lends
an earnest ear to the theory that if it works
more than 30 or 36 hours a week its fragile
constitution will break, and if it doesn’t go
slow in working hours it will burst up.
Labor in Australia has done far less than
in many countries in the way of co-operative
industry—in fact, it has done practically
nothing in that line towards superseding the
capitalist, presumably because its ill-selected
talk-bosses have a profound lack of faith in
their own capacity to run even a petty shop
on solvent principles. Furthermore, the
Australian, of the class which supplied so
mudh of that army whose initiative and
individuality were its outstanding features,
when at home has a reverence for a certain
kind of authority which passes the sub-
missiveness of the Jesuit to his spiritual
superiors. At the beginning of the great
strike the seamen even allowed their right
to hold a ballot on the question to be taken
from them by two men of mouth-filling de-
clamation whose election to their positions
was said by many to be irregular. Hun
discipline could go little further. The Aus-
tralian who leads this sort of life and only
varies its monotony by clamoring to the Gov-
ernment to start new relief railway works
out of loans, doesn’t seem at all like the self-
dependent, independent, tireless and tre-
mendously resourceful man of the war
front; yet he is the same under different
chiefs and in a different environment. A
quarter-century ago the world cot a glimpse
of still a third Australian. This one had
all that the present-day leaders could ask—-
a rich grant of land free of taxes and mili-
tary service, elimination of the employer
and the capitalist, a carefully-picked society
from which all unfriendly persons had been
eliminated, a fair amount of money to start
with and freedom to work out his own
destiny. When his money had been spent
and his earning capacity got down through
much dissension to about 4s. a week, he
became a jest to even the poor unlettered
Indians of Paraguay. That was also a
matter of leadership and mental atmosphere,
and the leader in that case as in the sea-
men’s strike was imported because the Aus-
tralian lacked faith in his ability to grow
even his own false prophet.
The Pankhurst Woes.
If it was possible to put a prohibitive duty
on imported grievances Australia would be
an easier place to govern and a better place
to live in. So would any other decent and
well-ordered country. It is only decent
countries which suffer in this way—coun-
tries which allow the franchise to be used
freely and open their doors pretty wide to
all and sundry, and are easy in the matter
Earth Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mother and maker of us all,
The flags are down, the trumpets cease;
Dead war beneath its splendid pall
Has yielded place to living peace.
By all we wrought and all we said.
Make thy sons worthy of their dead.
We tore thy breast with steel and flame;
And in the hate that brimmed to flood,
Hard-smiting in thy holy name
We drenched the fields with brother-blood
By that wild tempest hot and red,
Oh, make us worthy of our dead!
The pain, the wrath, the shame, the scorn
Are passing like the clouded night;
The promise of the growing morn
Is golden in the people’s sight.
What thought is here that we should dread
If we be worthy of our dead?
There comes no challenge loud and vain,
No vaunting of unchastened pride;
No kingcraft fills a world with pain
That wrong of might be deified.
Oh, not in vain the millions bled
If we be worthy of our dead!
The little voices faint and fail;
A grander music fills our ears.
Only in dreams we hear the wail
Far-rising from the murdered years,
.While the new days lift up their head,
Worthy of us and of our dead.
Above the graves the grasses nod,
Below the fort the poppies bow.
Mother of all, to thee and Gon
The war-taught nations make their vow—
By stars that shone and hopes that led
We shall be worthy of our dead!

of naturalisation, and allow great liberty of
speech and action to the uninvited guest*
and are slow to throw the uninvited ntiis-
ance into the Bastille without trial or to
maroon him On an island. Strange irrecon-
cilables with a bitterness aghinst all the
weirlfl and a desire to destroy everything
didn’t take refuge in old Russia or old Tur-
key. Rather it took the local irreconcilableS
all their time to get out. Australia, be-
cause there is none in the world with more
liberal institutions, is a special sufferer.
Russians and Poles, whose whole natures,
as well as the natures of their fathers and
grandfathers, have been warped by the bru-
tality of Grand Dukes and Secret Police
officials—men who, in addition to being
warped themselves, are bringing up warped
and cross-eyed sons —rage at large, especi-
ally in Queensland, where their sort are
numerous. They once lived under the worst
kind of class government, and in their nar-
row, poisoned minds their little old corner
of the world is the universe, and all Gov-
ernments are the worst kind of class tyranny
and only fit for destruction. Even though
the most democratic institutions in the
world are all around them, they say that
such things don’t exist. They simply can’t
exist because they aren’t to be found in
Grand Duke Land. The Hun is a sample
of the same species. So, in a mild degree,
is the Irishman, whose way of running or
breaking things here is often very different
from what it would be if his own island had
received different treatment from parties
over whom we have no control. And in the
present frenzied industrial struggle to de-
stroy the arbitration principle which good
Australians toiled so long to establish, the
same old evil of the Imported Grievance is
manifest. The king-pin—the pope, dicta-
tor, tyrant-in-chief, small Robespierre and
boss brass-trumpeter in the movement to
obliterate the most valuable institution Aus-
tralian Labor possesses—is the imported
man Walsh. He is greatly aided and pro-
bably influenced by his imported wife, a
lady of the Pankiiurst family. This was
quite an ordinary middle-class family, which
Ranked along like any other family till it
took up the perfectly legitimate Women’s
Suffrage grievance in England. Then it
rioted, broke windows, got man-handled by
the police, was arrested, put in cold cells,
subjected to the indignity of bodily inspec-
tion by female warders, fined, imprisoned,
cat-and-moused under the Cat and Mouse
law, and otherwise irritated. It attained
that frame of mind in which every symbol of
the law, from the policeman on point duty
to Parliament and the Lord Chancellor, was
an enemy. The younger Pankiiursts were
brought up in that atmosphere, just as a
Russian might be brought up in an atmo-
sphere of Grand Dukes and the Third Sec-
tion. It may be generations before it will
Pank along quietly as of old or be fitted to
take a wholly sane view of public affairs.
There is no room for suffragette agitation
in Australia, for woman here has the vote;
but this avenue being closed, something must
be .done to the Government, all Govern-
ments being accursed because one of them
at the. other end of the world got into holts
with the senior Pankhurst lady. If the
Government here can’t be attacked as for-
merly for not granting arbitration because
it has granted it in the widest form, the
next thing is to raise sheol and riot and
misery and starvation because it won’t take
the thing away. No one ever heard of the
Pankhursts as social reformers before
they were soured by the suffragette mix-up,
but now they are probably ready to reform
anything, even to reform it backwards. The
strike against arbitration has exposed
women and children and babies to hunger,
has made them live in fireless rooms and
shiver through the lack of pawned blankets,
has made many of them wish they were dead
and has probably caused a good many to he
dead. And some part, however small, of
these horrors is probably traceable to the
fact that the well-fed Pankiiurst household
got a mental bias and turned Ishmaelite
because of something that happened to Ma
Pankhurst in England—something for
which no Australian woman or infant was
one whit responsible. When the memory
of old rows in London fades a little this
view of the case may possibly dawn on the
family; but that will be after the baby’s
funeral. The Importation of Grievances is
a curse.
Britain and the Menace of Inadequate
Production.
Sir Auckland Geddes (Minister of
National Service) said, in the House of
Commons, last week :—•
The outstanding fact is that the country’s work
is not being done. Profound and sudden industrial
changes are causing widespread disturbance, even
outside the trades where the changes are introduced.
If we hope to pass through the dark, anxipus days
ahead we must endeavor to renew the spirit pre-
vailing in war-time. The blame falls on those who
are not doing their best to increase production.
To impartial outside observers it seems that
the blame falls equally on the politicians
who have made no more preparations for
peace than they did for the recent war.
It is a platitude, nowadays, that the British
Freetrade craze for cheapness helped the
Hun to put up the fight he did. Britain
sold the Germans all the raw products they
wanted, and British ships humped German-
made goods over the world, to the prejudice
of British manufactures. The Germans
responded by granting subsidies to German
ships, and by allowing generous rebates on
freights on the State railways in the case
of goods for export. As an outcome of this,
added to an agreement which w T as come to
between the N.D.L. and the'English rail-
ways, it was actually cheaper to send goods
from Lancashire to Hamburg and back to
Southampton, than from Lancashire to
Southampton direct. At this period Britain
had the biggest unemployed problem in its
history; the smallest area of land under cul-
tivation in half a century (only 27,000,000
acres were being handled in England and
Wales combined) ; 40 per cent, of the popula-
tion of England were living two in a room ;
in Scotland one in 12 of the inhabitants
shared a room with four or more others;
and emigration was proceeding _ apace.
The old fiscal conditions still prevail, and
naturally the old social and industrial con-
ditions ate re-appearing. Nine London
papers out of ten talk complacently, almost
hopefully, of the British workers’ “emigra-
tion prospects.” Germany always has d.s-
eoUraged emigration, and now the Hun
Government will have the assistance therein
of most outside nations. Germany is start-
ing on What Muller (Foreign Minister)
described recently as “a 40 years’ march
through the desert.” But it is remarkably
well equipped for the journey. Its lands
are inviolate and its factories unharmed. It
has lost much, but its greatest assets were
indestructible —its organisation, its method 1 --,
its experience, its knowledge. If the
traditional Cobdenite policy of laissez-faire
is to continue in the United Kingdom, the
German indemnity may prove to be almost
as expensive as the war. The debt can only
be liquidated by the export of merchandise;
and failing a Protective tariff the stuff will
go chiefly, as in the past, to Britain. In
others words, the cheap goods of the Boche
will depress British trade, force British
capitalists to invest their money abroad, and
diminish employment at home. The United
Kingdom will find itself in the sorry position
Germany was in when France was paying
its debts with exports after 1871. Germany,
America and other Protectionist countries
have shown that the imposition of a tariff
is the most effective way possible to increase
production. And the United Kingdom could
do it without detriment to the Allies’, pros-
pect of recovering their share of the indem-
nity. The proper people to absorb German
goods, and to that extent shoulder part of
the burden of the war, are the neutral
nations. They made enormous profits out of
the carnage—in many cases by supplying
Germany with war necessaries. Their exor-
bitant prices helped to swell the Allies’ war
debt. And for the past five years they have
cold-bloodedly organised their industrial
rdants with the object of capturing the bel-
ligerents’ post-war trade. Let them continue
their association with the Entente, while
Britain, by a system of preferential tariffs,
buys and sells chiefly amongst its friends.
It is poor business to win a great war arid
afterwards sacrifice industries and risk
anarchy in order that the beaten party may
pay his share of the damages.

A Loan for Hats and Frills.
The local loan is an evil because it tends
to perpetuate a creditor class, and easily-
got money—even paper money—raised at the
charge of posterity leads to laziness, cor-
ruption and incapacity. Still, the local in-
terest bill is a mere taking of money out
of the community’s aggregate left-hand
pocket and putting it in the aggregate right-
hand pocket. The foreign loan has all the
evils of laziness, corruption, incapacity and
a dishonest leaving of the bill to the infant,
with the additional one that it means taking
money out of our own pocket to put it into
someone else’s pocket, and doing.this twice
a year for ever and a day. It is the per-
petuation and expansion of the Absentee
Curse about which Ireland has complained
so justly and so bitterly for many years,
though, strange to say, politicians of Irish
descent in Australia have been fairly active
in fastening their Native Curse on this
country. Premier Ryan of Queensland, with
his recent £10.000,000 loan proposition, is
a case in point. Anybody who has noticed
the difference between paying, say, £IOO to
himself and paying £IOO to somebody else
will see the point. Still, the big absentee
loan, or a whole terrace of them, is inevit-
able, if the policy of big imports and few
local manufactures and plenty of strikes is
to be kept up. The position may be set out
as follows: —
Australia recently owed £38,000,000, and the
amount is probably larger now, to the British
Government for the upkeep of our army at the
Front and other expenses. (In addition, of course,
there is the chronic interest liability.)
This has to be paid by sending gold from here or
by sending goods which will sell for gold. A local
loan might supply the money required twice over,
but it would be paper money—our own IOU pay-
able by ourselves to ourselves, very good for local
purposes Such as paying wages to Australian artisans
if we had them; but £40,000,000 of it wouldn’t
pay a week’s wages to the cheapest laborer in Eng-
land or even in China.
We can’t send the gold because we haven’t got
anything like the necessary amount. And we aren’t
likely to have it, seeing that the year’s gold pro-
duction promises to be only about £4,800,000.
As regards the goods, it is necessary to export,
quite apart from paying war expenses, a very great
deal more than we import, so that the difference
will cover the interest on foreign Federal
debts, State debts, municipal debts, private
debts (money lent here on mortgage and
otherwise by foreign financial institutions), dividends
to absentee traders (importers), and dividends to
absentee banks, insurance companies and the like.
The amount is largely guesswork, but £20,000,000
a year looks like a moderate guess.
And this country isn’t meeting its liability by a
long, long way. It exports less than it should do
because it doesn’t make things. Or (which is the
same statement in other words) it imports far more
than it should do because it doesn't make things
and yet won’t do without things. A new generation
of prophets and hot-gospellers and world-savers
preaches that work is a sign of degradation, though
servile begging for loans isn’t; that to know how
to do things for ourselves is a symptom of ignorance;
and that we should rather aim at being like the
French nobleman of the old regime, and have our
clothes and our breakfast coffee brought to us by
inferior folks, just as his were brought to him by
his valet. Also they hold that “the worker” should
be independent and at the same time the serf of any
capitalist who will advance money at his own (the
capitalist's) rate of interest.
Another foreign war loan is inevitable, also
a long indefinite procession of foreign loans
after that, unless the imports are made a
great deal less in proportion to population
and also in proportion to local production.
One way of putting the matter is that,
exports being insufficient to pay for imports
and for interest on old foreign debts and
a trifle towards war charges, money is being
borrowed to pay for interest and war
charges. The other way is that, exports
being insufficient to pay interest on old
debts, to reduce the war bill, and to meet
the account for women’s foreign hats and
frills, clothing of all sorts, ironware and
the other things we should make ourselves,
money is being borrowed to pay for the
hats and the other evidences of laziness and
luxury. The Bulletin prefers the second
version. It is the true one, for the country
must pay the interest and the war hill, but
it has no need to pay the other account.
The Sale of the Wool Clip.
“A.L.H.” ON the great wool deal: —
O. C. Beale’s lament (B. 10/7/’l9) would be
more convincing to the practical wool man were his
assertions and deductions more in accordance with
the facts. He commences by complaining that the
Australian Government is asking the Mother Coun-
try to take the raw material for at least another
year and possibly for several years at ludicrously
low prices. Surely Mr. Beale is not suggesting
that we repudiate a contract made during the
darkest stages of the war, on the ground that we
now find we have made a bad bargain and would
like to get out of it?
Mr. Beale reviews the comparative prices of raw
wool and raw cotton. One might as well compare
the price of wool and ’possum skins. Cotton is a
commodity which wastes on an average 12 p.c. in
manufacture, and even then the waste is market-
able, while wool wastes 50 p.c. in washing alone.
Besides which, the difference in cost of handling
and manufacture of the two raw products is very
considerable.
According to Mr. Beale, it is Australia that pays
for carrying the dirt in wool to Europe. I thought
that the British Government, which is purchasing
our wool on a f.o.b. basis, was paying the freight.
It was stupid of me.
The fact is, our woolgrowers are on a remark-
ably good wicket, and if a plebiscite were taken
it is doubtful whether they would express a desire
for any immediate change in the method of market-
ing the staple. Under the. terms of file contract
50 p.c. of any profits made from the re-sale of any
wools for other than military purposes are to be
returned to the growers. The amount of
Australian wool used for military purposes
during the coming year is likely to be
infinitesimal, so the growers will come in on the
profit of practically the whole of the present clip,
in addition to the unshipped portion of the two
previous clips. As far as can be gathered from the
latest cabled market reports, and after allowing
for freight and other charges, wool is selling in
London at about 75 p.c. above the local appraise-
ment price of 15Jd. all round. Now 75 p.c. profit
on 15*d. is llfd., 50 p.c. of which is 53d. Thus,
providing that world’s prices are maintained, the
ultimate guaranteed return to the Australian grower
for his next clip will be not 15|d. per 11*., but
something over 21d., or nearly three times his pre-
war price.
As to Mr. Beale's remarks concerning depreci-
ated currency, etc., he may be right or he may be
wrong; hut 1 am still in the dark as to what con-
nection the price of the Australian sovereign in Cey-
lon has with the price of Australian wool in either
Australia or Europe.
The Landlord.
It is just 126 years since France began to
establish the principle that the man who
worked the land might also be trusted to
own it. In other words, the idea got around
that he might rub along without maintain-
ing an overlord or cormorant who did no
agriculture himself and often knew none,
and who spent the tribute in keeping up
more palaces than any one human being
could live in, and frequently in divorce-
court and ballet-girl expenses. Over the
Channel the Buccleuch duke with his
400,000 acres, his seven palaces and his
much more than seven slums, was and is
a notorious case. The British system re-
garded the cormorant as essential and laid
itself out to preserve him in a most unusual
and extraordinary fashion. Until very re-
cently, when the rich manufacturer, finan-
cier or newspaper-owner was allowed to
break into the sacred circle, peers belonged
exclusively to the dirt-possessing class. Wh»n
an impecunious soldier like Churchill
had to be elevated the necessary land
and palace were found for him so that he
might qualify. A peer without much land
was only half a peer, and a really big
earth-owner without a peerage was an
anomaly that had to be rectified. The first
was akin to the Jew by religion who is not
a Jew by birth, and the second to the Jew
by birth who is not also one by faith, both
being misfits and very rare. As a peer who
lost or sold his earth was a fallen noble-
man, the tradition of hanging on like glue or
grim death to the big estates was very
strong. In Australia the great landed pro-
prietor isn’t an hereditary baron or duke,
which takes away one-half his inducement
to hang on. Besides, the graduated land-tax,
the special tax on incomes not derived from
personal exertion, and the landlord s
liability for rates do some damage to the
other half. (In England the tenant pa vs
all rates, and if a property is vacant they
lapse because there is no one but the land-
lord to pay them, and to make him pay
would be the beginning of a bad precedent.)
The English landlord has also most com-
prehensive rights to minerals, so long as
he doesn’t go down beyond the centre of
the earth: to foreshores and the whales and
wrecks cast up thereon by the sea; and to
running water. Britain and Russia between
them had the luck to annex most of the
empty habitable places of the earth, and
they sent hordes of disgruntled tenants
there, and helped them to settle as small
proprietors on conditions as unlike those of
the homeland as possible. Extra-disgruntled
tenants were sent to Virginia or Botany Bay
or Siberia as convicts, and afterwards turned
into settlers. This postponed a difficult
problem, but all the same the day of the
great landlord is past in its Russian strong-
hold and is apparently passing in the
British. Compulsory military service has
shaken the old humble Hodge 'of England
out of his groove; and the war bill has
brought it horpe to him that he can no
longer afford to keep any duke supplied with
seven palaces in addition to ballet-girls,
divorce expenses and the £13.000 fi year
alimony to an enraged wife. Britain may
be 126 years behind, but it - threatens to
catch up.
Enemies of the Australian Sugar
Farmer.
“Te Babakantiko” talks shop :
The Hambledon, Mulgrave and Babinda districts,
stretching from Cairns southward, and separated
from the Pacific Ocean by but a narrow
range of densely-wooded mountains, arc most
typical of the northernmost sugar-cane areas iir
Australia. In this low-lying, narrow valley, through:
portion of which the swift Mulgrave and the Russell
rivers flow, and sometimes overflow, covering the:
cane-farms for a couple of miles, conditions resemble 1
those of Fiji, most ideal of sugar-growing lands,
on the globe. When in winter the frost lies heavy-
on the lofty Atherton tableland which overshadows.
Gordonvale, centre of the Mulgrave district, the'
night, refrigerated by the inland breeze, is cool
and even bitter in this tropic valley. Yet frosts
are never known and the check to the growth of
cane is insignificant.
The land, mostly cleared in Kanaka-labor days,,
lies a broad band of beautiful green and smiling
wealth, dotted with prosperous-looking farmhouses.
Yet here and there a yellowing, brownish drying
of the cane-leaves is becoming gradually more con-
spicuous. Not infrequently the change of certain
fields from healthy green to the death-hue of yellow
is startlingly sudden. For the children of Lepidiota
albohirta, otherwise the larva; (the white cane-
grub) of the grey-back beetle, are busily devouring
the roots of the growing cane. Each female grey-
back produces up to 26 grubs (36 have been re-
corded) ; and, as every cane stool in the affected
area may have from a dozen to 70 large, fat,
gluttonous larvae among its roots, incessantly eating,
the roots are soon consumed and the cane dies and
falls over. Very large cane areas, among others
the Pyramid Estate, have been so badly eaten that
they are out of cultivation. The largest estate in
the Mulgrave district, Green Hills, an ancient vol-
cano whose wrecked crater stands in red volcanic
soil 75ft. deep and so rich that good crops are
continually produced without artificial manuring, is
being rapidly destroyed by grubs. More than half
of Green Hiils’ 900 acres is a pitiful scene of devas-
tation, the cane-fields brown, dead and dying, and
with large areas of cane fallen. Cutting this season
will barely cover expenses.
Infested areas are situated principally within half
a mile to leeward of scrub containing the beetles’
feeding-trees. The grey-back is a denizen of the
scrub; it feeds on the leaves of numerous varieties
of trees, but prefers the Moreton Bay ash, the blood-
wood and the fig family. F’rom these trees the
beetles fly haphazardly with the prevailing wind, to
lay their eggs in the ground. Blady-grass roots
suited Mrs. Albohirta very well until, to the beetles
unbounded delight, man supplied that most succu-
lent of all grub-diets, sugar-cane.
Lepidiota albohirta, though the most destructive,
is not the only beetle whose grubs devastate sugar-
farms. There is Lepidiota jrenchi, L. rothei, L.
caudata and others, in about that order of size
and cussedness. In the Gordonvale area in on©
year 22 tons of beetles and 9 tons of grubs Were
collected at a cost of £8000; Green Hills alone, in
1917, yielded 15 tons of beetles. Credit each
female beetle with the very modest family of six
grubs, and multiply that family by, say, half of
the 22 tons! Collecting the beetles and grubs kept
the pest in cheek without diminishing its numbers.
When beetle collecting—a welcome source of in-
come to residents—was discontinued the pesti
naturally increased.
Natural enemies assist in the grub-control, par*
ticularly the scolia wasps. The parasite wasp
stings the grub first in the mouth and next in the
body, in the centre of the bunch of legs, paralysing
without killing its prey. The egg is fastened on
end between folds on the grub’s belly; the wasp
larvae promptly enters its living host, feeding upon
him until ready to pupate, and leaves him dead and
but an empty skin. The muscardine fungus also
attacks the grubs. Another cane-enemy is the borer-
beetle, whose name indicates its activities; and its
grub is being placed under control by its parasite,
the tachinid-fly. And there is the army-worm, whose
favorite prey is young plant cane; and the noctuid
moth-borer, Pliragmatophilla truncata, whose cater-
pillar dines inside the shoot of young cane, killing
the central leaves, and on mature cane bores into
the stalks behind the upper leaf-sheaths, tunnelling
and causing the cane to shoot freely at the “eyes”
because of the injury to the terminal bud. Both
these have their parasites, as the scolia or digger
wasps mentioned have parasites in their turn, even
as the parasitic tachinid-fly of the borer-beetle has
its enemies in the jumping-spider and an ant, which
here are not quite so numerous as in Fiji, where the
tachinid-fly, introduced by Dr. Illingworth in 1913
from Hawaii, met with practical annihilation.
Of course some of these grubby sugar-farms are
for sale. Yet if the owners would but profit
by the information available, unremunerative grub-
farming might be transformed into lucrative cane-
growing. The average sugar-cane grower may dis-
miss definitely any idea he may have that a
beneficent Government may discover some magic fluid
a vial whereof will banish all the grubs his farm is
heir to. Such magic cures do not exist. By clear-
ing the scrub and killing the beetle-feeding trees
to windward of his fields, by ploughing sufficient
humus in the form of green-crop, trash, or mill-
refuse into the soil for the grubs to keep busy
upon instead of eating the cane-roots; where infes-
tation exists, by planting late to enable him to cul-
tivate the land assiduously during the beetles’ flight
and ovipositing (December to February), and by
breaking up the soil and thus discouraging egg-
laying beetles as well as disturbing eggs already
laid, so that the birds may dine sumptuously on
eggs and grubs—by doing these things, the cane-
grower will take a long step in the right direction.
Poisons, principally arsenic, are used sporadically,
and are generally applied in too large quantities.
The permanent benefit of arsenic is as yet doubtful,
though it certainly kills grubs. Poisons are
dangerous to handle, and arsenic in particular re-
mains in the soil for years with its activity unim-
paired. Further, insects may eventually become
immune to poisons. Almost certainly man’s greatest
aid in grub-destruction—birds—will succumb in
numbers to a diet of poisoned grubs, imgrane or
otherwise, during the time of cultivation. Until
definitely advised, poisons should, therefore, be used
only as a desperate remedy for a desperate farm
disease.
Los Angeles (Cal.) and Eden (N.S.W.)#
There is a proposal to start a direct steam
service between Sydney and Los Angeles
(California). This is interesting. Los
Angeles is, or was, to San Francisco much
what Eden (Twofold Bay) is to Sydney,
and is about the same distance away. But
it has this disadvantage compared with Eden
—it started life as an inland town. In its
ambition, however, it stretched till it nearly
broke its neck to include a harbor—and not
the best one in the world, either. But its
railway wasn’t bossed by San Francisco
politicians and importers in the sole interests
of the Big City. In fact San Francisco*

though for a long while it was the only big
Californian city, isn’t the State capital; for
the Yankees have a steady hatred of having
the State capital in the overcrowded haunt
where importers and financiers and land-
speculators can live on the Ministerial door-
step. California, with a population of about
3.000,000 against N. S. Wales’s 2,000,000,
has no city anything like so big as Sydney ;
yet its second, third and fourth places beat
Newcastle hollow. The metropolis, Sacra-
mento, ranks fourth. Los Angeles ranked
third at one time; but as any person or
company with money could build a railway
without the One Big City politicians either
inndering them or faking the rates after-
wards to prevent the line carrying trade
anywhere except to the One Big City, quite
a lot of lines came its way and were managed
in the local interest. So the place that once
was Eden, only without Twofold Bay quite
at its door, grew to be the largest city of
California, with San Francisco second, Oak-
land a good third and the capital some
distance behind. There is a certain vigorous
atmosphere and a great; deal of municipal
patriotism in a country where any village
has the chance to become the boss town of
its State. It is especially so where the seat
of government is almost always a respectable
minor town, so that politics will keep as
far as possible away from business, and
public buildings won’t occupy the most
valuable commercial sites in the country,
thus crowding the non-official folk into the
dens of Strawberry Hills and Camperdown
(Sydney) and Richmond (Melbourne). The
capital can then stand aloof from the
struggle to crowd and bloat, not being itself
in the bloating competition. And, as a
further advantage, the U.Si almost in-
variably has its capitals inland, away from
the importers. Australia may grow places
like Los Angeles instead of places like Eden,
■Geelong, Portland and Albany without the
Drawback of privately-owned railways, but
.only if the States are made much more
.numerous and laid out on different
'principles.
X ; *—■
From a Vic. gold-mining man : :
As to the value of the gold industry of Victoria
(B. 10/7/T9), where would the other primary,
secondary . and tertiary industries of Australia be
but for it? Bury your father, by all means, when
he is dead, but don’t hound him into an unhonored
grave; and above all don’t bury him before he is
'lead, because the old man might give an unexpected
kick. The Bulletin says that a good boot factory
has more enduring value than the Garden Gully cr
the Long Tunnel. Garden Gully produced 20 tons
of gold, supported some hundreds of men and their
dependants for half a century, and provided share-
holders with £1,000,000, some of which presumably
was spent in building, say, boot factories, which
might possibly otherwise have been absent. Long
Tunnel did twice as much as Garden Gully. Would
The Bulletin please submit a list of boot factories
showing better results for endurance and value com-
bined, as the writer is looking for lucrative invest-
ments of the money that he has made out of
gold-mining ?
, To which The Bulletin merely says:
If this country set up a laboratory to make
diamonds and produced gems which sold for £5
at a cost of £lO, we should go broke on the
business if we pushed it far enough. It is just as
■certain we shall go broke if we produce enough
.gold which costs us £6 an ounce.
• Gold-mining in Victoria is a wasting industry.
To continue to quote the millions that have been
•got out for the purpose of inducing people to put
millions in isn’t always dishonest, but often is.
This paper doesn’t know where the primary,
secondary and tertiary industries of Victoria would
be but for the gold industry. But it does know
■that nowadays, when it most often costs £5 to get
• £3 worth of gold, the secondary and tertiary indus-
tries would be better off if the £2 wasn’t wasted
■in valueless holes.
There is still room for some gold-mining and some
gold-prospecting - . But there isn’t much room; and
•the man who “invests” except on the very best
expert advice obtainable is unduly risking capital
'which this country badly wants for “secondary”
industries that will last as long as civilisation.
“Champagne” : Thera is a decided shortage
of French sparkling wines in- Australia, and
letters to hand by recent mails disclose that
the awful toll exacted by invading Huns
from Rheims and Epernay, the champagne
district, of France, is responsible. Ten years
ago a case of a dozen quarts of any fine
brand was' to be had in Sydney for 120 s.
In 1914 it was 1405.. and what limited stock
is for sale now is doled out by merchants at
2605., and retailed at 27s 6d. to 30s. a bottle,
vintage never being insisted on. The letters
referred to make it clear that the job of re-
organisation and rehabilitation is so vast that
it will be years before normal business is
resumed ; until then prices will he very high
and stocks limited and scarce. The. Bulle-
tin has recently given prominence to the fact
that Australian wines are at present in for-
eign demand/ to an extent which has no paral-
lel in the trade. The war taught many a
good Digger that Australian-made goods are
unequalled—ask any Aussie about boots,
khaki, canned fruit and jam. So with, our
wines. Without any deliberate intent to
profit by the war-burdens of a splendid ally,
the fact is that Australia for several years
has been steadily perfecting her experience
of manufacturing sparkling wines of high
grade. They are to be had from wholesale
merchants at from 60s. to 90s. per case
quarts, and are highly comparable with the
best French wines ever shipped here. Cham-
pagne at 30s. a bottle is for princes and cattle
kings; at six or seven shillings no self-
respecting suburban father of the bride need
he without it. There is no reason why its
fame abroad should not equal that of our
“still” wines, the abnormal demand for which
it is now practically impossible to supply.
An opportunity arises from France’s simple
commercial inability to fill orders. In N. S.
Wales the Hunter River Valley, Rooty Hill
and Mirrool undoubtedly produce a sparkling
wine of quality equalling any made in South
Aus.; and some knowledge of a little-known
industry which is thus offered a great chance
will be no burden for any Australian to
carry.
♦
Australia has many other signs of megalo-
mania besides the habit of keeping seven
imported Governor’s on its pay-sheet. Its
big ideas are based not on its earnings, but
on its earnings and borrowings combined.
It now proposes to “do the thing properly”
in the way of war memorials. A great
central museum at Canberra and subsidiary
museums at State capitals are projected.
PONTIUS GARDEN WASHES HIS HANDS IN ADVANCE.
“Mr. Garden, secretary of the O.B.U., warned the public that, if a general strike happened, the
leaders would not hold themselves responsible for anything it might lead to. At a point the rank
and file would take matters into their own hands.” —News item.
J. S. GARDEN : “Now, mind you, I shall not he responsible if this blows up. You fellows
stay here and have the credit — I’ve got a pressing engagement up the street."
In them are to be housed a collection of
some 3000 captured Hun machine-guns and
700 big Hun guns, and all manner of other
trophies. They will require acres of house-
room with domes above it; also cutators,
polishers, floor-washers, dust-flickers, fly-
removers, armed guardians to prevent the
I.W.W. stealing the trophies and holding
an insurrection, and probably a Board of
Trophies and a High Commissioner. Yet
while one gun or one pyramid may be a
curio, 3700 guns or 3700 pyramids are
likely to be as monotonous as 37,000 aider-
men. On top of the trophies it is sug-
gested that Australia should be garnished
with photographs of everybody who went
from here to the war, and those who tried
to go but were rejected, and those who live
here in a general way but enlisted else-
where, and those who died before embarka-
tion so that they couldn’t go, and those who
didn’t die but weren’t allowed to embark,
and those who served in the transport busi-
ness or any other business. And there are
to be volumes and libraries giving full par-
ticulars of everybody, and buildings to put
the volumes in, and people to dust them
and keep the silverfish out of them, and
to catalogue them and insure them, and
hose them in case of fire. Permanent com-
mittees of one sort or another will doubtless
hold meetings in permanent committee-
rooms. and gardeners will look after the
grounds attached to the books and guns, and
Kiosks and fountains and refreshment-rooms
will be a matter of course. The people who
built Australia House have a reputation to
live up to. And damn the expense!
•‘Solomon M.”: In view of the proposal
of Dr. Maloney, M.H.R., that the old age
pension, like the baby bonus, should be
paid to the rich as well as the poor, couldn’t
some * arrangement, be made by which a
lady could get the old age pension arid the
baby bonus at the same time? There are
plenty of affluent women who would gladly
accept them simultaneously, and they would
be handy to buy a big imported hat with.
Here’s another plum to pick —with “pre-
ference given to returned soldiers.” The
rich Melbourne suburb of Sandringham
wants an assistant surveyor “at a salary
of £2 10s. per week.” And lest anybody
might be tempted to offer somebody a hun-
dred or two for helping to land the prize,
the men for whom “nothing is too good” are
warned that personal or any other canvass
of councillors will disqualify.

The “coppers” are to have a competitor,
as the Melbourne Mint expects to be issu-
ing nickel pennies and halfpennies within
the next few months. Mint officials have
been working on the design, etc., for some
time, and specimen coins will shortly be
submitted to the Treasury for approval. The

idea that a ha’penny can buy anything these
days.
A number of thinly-attended meetings
have been held lately with a view, to getting
Canberra set up at once. No one is reported
to have said that a Capital in Two Pieces
about 133 miles apart is desirable. Nobody
said that Canberra is the best site in Aus-
tralia nor even the tenth-best site in N. S.
Wales. Other things which haven’t been
mentioned are (1) that the proposal that
a popular vote should be taken on the
selection of a site was refused by Parlia-
mentary log-rollers; and (2) that a Federal
territory, which, despite the expenditure of
£1,000,000 on it, was losing population at
the last estimate, even when Government
officials were counted, and could show-
less than humans to the square mile,
seems rather bare of natural advantages.
In fact, the only attitude of the thinly-
attended meetings is that the Constitution
will be outraged unless Can —berra, which
isn’t mentioned in the Constitution, is set
going at once. Nobody alleges that it has
coal or iron or water-power or special fer-
tility or much rain or any commercial advan-
tages or the popular sanction —only that the
world will never revolve properly without
the Metropolis of a Bit Here and a Bit
There.
His Ex. Davidson, of N. S. Wales, feeliin:
that he must do something—the usefulness of
State Governors being in question—sets out
to round up £lOO,OOO for Sydney Hospital.
It is a useful enough idea if not very bril-
liant. In fact, the only striking idea of
the sort that ever came out of an Australian
Government House emerged in Tasmania in
John Franklin’s day. Lady Franklin thought
it would be a great thing to banish snakes
from the Speck ; so, being a practical person,
instead of sending round the plate she
offered out of her own purse Is. per head.
In one year she got 14.000 heads. Then she
decided that it couldn’t be done on a
Governor’s salary.
The day before the Vic. Premier relin-
quished the Labor portfolio in favor of Mat
Baird, a dapper-looking man called at the
public offices, and told an official that he
desired to see Mr. Lawson about “a lift.”
The official, who had just got the tip as to
what was going to be done, said “No use;
you’re too late —Baird has got the job;
better luck next time.” Explanations fol-
lowed. The caller was really looking for
an obscure but useful ofhcer of th; Labor
Department, C. G. Lawson, whose job it is
to inspect elevators, and the civil servant
mistook him for a recently-elected country
member in a hurry to get a lift into a Min-
istry.
The returned soldiers’ congress held in
Adelaide has denounced the present system
of limiting to £l5O the advance given to a
man to start a business. According to most
of the speakers, it generally meant wasting
the £l5O, besides “breaking the hearts of the
best men.” A motion was carried declaring
that the maximum should be £625. McKen-
zie (Vic.) said they had been told in France,
and England that it would be £750. The
Congress spent a brisk hour or two in de-
nouncing an advt. appearing in an Adelaide
paper—“ Farmer, 36, like correspond with
Australian-German girl, aged 23 to 30.” The
same McKenzie introduced the matter, and
later had to apologise for attributing the
advt. to the Register, whereas it really
appeared in the Advertiser.
“M.A.0.” : I am a mother who wanted '.o
send a son to Duntroon to become an
engineer officer in the Australian Defence
Forces. Naturally I have studied and pon-
dered the matter, and have come to the
conclusion that in this alleged democracy the
rules have been framed to exclude all bat
the rich. After 35 years’ service to his
country the officer may get £5OO a year, and
at 58 be turned out without pension. Aus-
tralia, as far as I can learn, is the only
part of the Empire which provides no pension
to permanent soldiers and sailors. > Nor is
there any prospect of an officer being able
to make provision for his old age arid his
wife’s; for though the salaries are through-
out poor, there are no allowances or
quarters, as in India, England and elsewhere.
A great deal has been written lately about
the wisdom of inviting officers who dis-
tinguished themselves in the late war to join
our Defence Army. But what chance have
we of getting them when the conditions are
so illiberal? And if we could get them —
as we ought to —what right have we to call
on them to make such further personal sacri-
fices for their patriotism?
On the day of the opening of the Vic.
State Parliament, the building, owing to
strike conditions, was as chilly as in 1901,
when it gave S. T. Staughton the shivers
from which he never recovered. Staughton
was perhaps more missed than any other
rich man the House has since lost. He and
John Hancock, most genial of Labor mem-
bers, were boon pals. On a night when plenty
of latitude was possible in debate Staughton
told how he had offered John the freehold
of 50 acres of the best land at Staughton
Vale provided he would chuck his wrong-
headed politics, and go up and live on the
holding. Of course the offer had been re-
fused because, Staughton chuckled, John
didn’t have the requisite energy. The House
looked to Hancock for a counter, and it
came. It was true, said John, that Staugh-
ton had put' such a proposition before him.
and that lie had refused. But the refusal
was not for the reason given by the member
for West Bourke. It was because he
( John) had realised that if he took up the
land lie wouldn’t be on it six mouths before
he would be implored by requisition to re-
lieve the constituency of West Bourke from
the stigma of being represented by Staugh-
ton. To nominate would be base ingratitude:
so_ he had resisted temptation and thrust
aside the gift.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The S. M. Hebalb seems to be looking
for a new joss. After a long argument with
itself it recently came to this conclusion
with a long-drawn sigh:—
So there are dangers of exploitation by local
manufacturers if importation is prevented. Kcccnt
developments in the United States indicate the dan-
gers of exploitation by the importer. Which danger
are we to incur—that which we may control, or that
over which we have no control?
When a slow-going old lady talks like that
something ought to be looming in regard
to protection for Australian industries.
The Bulletin pointed out as far back
as June 26 tliat the Aliens Board was
the proper tribunal to handle the case of
Paul Freeman, the bogus hunger-striker,
who was then being held by the military
authorities. Last Friday Victoria Barracks
announced that the suggested course was to
he followed, and meanwhile Freeman goes
to an internment camp. He has one
legitimate grievance, anyhow-—that he was
kept in confinement long after a means of
dealing with his case had presented itself.
The man who declines to be responsible for
his wife’s debts is common enough, but the
man who advertises that he won’t be answer-
able for his own is rare. Secretary Garden,
of the 0.8. U., is one of the curiosities. He
explained in the papers lately that a
general strike- —not a mere one-trade stop-
page—is being prepared by himself and
others, and when once they get it started
they don’t know what will happen except
that anything may happen. “The fight will
be like the fight in England recently, when
it was taken out of the hands of the leaders
and the rank and file took control.” Pontius
Pilate lit the fuse and then washed his
hands. Pontius Garden is more circumspect,
lie washes his hands in advance.
Tt looks as if Irvine will have a long
innings as a temporary Excellency, Lawson
told the Vic. Parliament that he authorised
McPherson to suggest to Milner that he
should' not be in a hurry to appoint a
successor to Stanley after his leave, expires
in February, 1920. Milner concurred per-
sonally, and said he would await further
pow-wows on the subject. How McPherson
shaped as a diplomat is not known, but Law-
son declares, in effect, that if his Treasurer
went beyond his brief the Government is
not responsible. All that was desired, he
explained, was to afford ample time for the
Cabinet and Parliament to come to a de-
cision. after ascertaining whether any early
constitutional changes in the relations be-
tween the Commonwealth and the States
are likely. Toorak is dubious, and is won-
dering whether it is quite proper for its
member, Norman Bayles—a pillar of the
Melbourne Club —to act as McPherson’s
locum tenens in looking after Hawthorn
constituency affairs in his absence.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commiss’on has
reported to President Wilson upon the
“virtual monopoly, of international scope,
which has resulted from the co-operation of
five of the chief United States meat-packing
companies.” “International” inchides Aus-
tralia, of course. The George Washington
country has enacted very stringent laws
against trusts that operate inside the United
States. But it has a special law by which
anv trust, combine or pool may be organised
in the U.S. provided it operates abroad
say in Australia. In these circumstances
one gets tired of reading the speeches of
H. Y. Braddon, urging Uncle Sam to
renewed efforts to exploit this country. And
there is something unpleasant about the
recollection of that recent Amercian war-
rior who was allowed space in a Sydney
paper to say that his country thought all
the world of us and urged us not to build
a tariff wall round ourselves and keep a
yearning Meat Trust brother out.
The P.M.G. is being asked to look into
a little repatriation matter. Soldiers with
vocational training, it was alleged at a
recent committee meeting of the R.S.S.
League, are faced, on applying for specified
jobs in the Postal Department, with “tests
so increased in severity ,as to be almost be-
yond the limit of possible success.” It has
been suggested that this super-keenness in
selection, rather unusual in the appointment
of the rank and file of public servants, has
been prompted by, a postal official who
objects to the presence of returned ■ men
in his cosy nest of stay-at-homes. The s
charge calls for something more- from Web-
ster than 2000 words of indignant rhetoric
about the purity of his officers’ motives.
The mere fact that the soldier-applicants
have undertaken a preliminary training, in
the hope of getting placed somewhere, makes
out a prima facie case that they are willing
workers with some ambition. It should
be the business of the Postal officials to turn
THE SHOE BEGINS TO PINCH.
“The N.S.W. National Government proposes to deal with profiteering.” —Ministerial announcement.
THE MINISTERIAL BENCH : “ My dear sir , this profiteering of yours has become really
unbearable —it actually threatens to cost us our job!”
that willingness into efficiency. If they
'can’t do so, they should indicate plainly in
what way the vocational training has gone
wrong.
Even a belated application of the Whitley
principle knocked a very promising strike
on the head in Melbourne the other day.
Motormen on the Hawthorn Tramway got
the idea from some agitating wiseacre that
the reduction of the magnetic brake-power
from seven to four notches spelt disaster,
and refused to take out cars thus equipped.
Then they were invited to make a track
test of two vehicles, taken haphazard, and
did so. That ended the argument; the new
brake was better than the old. But of
course there should have been a workshop
committee to refer the question to immedi-
ately it arose. Prevention is better than
cure.
It is gleefully recorded in the Labor Call
that “the infuriated populace in Prague
erected gallows and threatened to hang 57
food-profiteers unless they took the oath
that they would sell their wares at reason-
able prices.” All profiteers took the re-
quired oath, and the Call remarked happily
that “evidently direct action had the desired
effect in this case.” Also enough infuriated
populace could be found in any Australian
city to take a Walsh or two tow ards tne
nearest lamp-post. And no doubt such a
course would have the “desired effect. ’
Still, the Labor Call wouldn’t be at all
happy about that.
“Importing Disease” should be included
among the causes of death. With many in-
fluenza and other patients the one hope lies
in keeping the heart going with compressed
oxygen. It is supplied in little cylinder's,
but there are only about 650 of them in
N.S.W. —say one to 500 square miles.
The" simple things aren’t made here and they
aren’t arriving from abroad because the
countries that make them have patients of
their own. So people die quickly—of Free-
trade. It is a beastly complaint.
ilad a little foresight and a pinch of tact
been used the batoning of decent citizens,
temporarily hard-up because of compulsory
idleness caused by the strike, might have
been avoided in Melbourne a few days ago.
It was apparently beneath the dignity of
Ministers, who knew that the unemployed
had gone to Parliament House, to telephone
somebody to pass the word to the crowd,
through the police inspector, that no ap-.
nointment had been made for a deputation
till next day. The result was a row, some
sore heads, a growl in Parliament, and the
suspension of Solly, who got the ad. that
properly belonged to Tunnecliffe.
From the .Federal Gallery :
A handful of members registered a pious aspira-
tion last week in favor of shifting the capital to
Canberra ; and that was their total response to the
agitation that has been at work in Sydney for the
past six months. The fact is three-fourths of the
N. S. W?les members will not go to ’Berra until
and unless they are dragged there.' They like Mel-
bourne well. Some approve of it as a place to
escape from their wives; others as a place where the
evanescent flirtation is easily begun and almost as
easily hidden from public view. The clubs and
pubs are comfortable, the entertainments many,
and the pomp and circumstance of the life consider-
able. The idea of exchanging it all for existence in
the rabbit-haunted wilderness is horrifying, even
to those members who originally won their seats on
the State Rights cry. And can anyone who knows
Canberra blame them?
Carson is De Valera’s best argument. The
swashbuckling old lawyer, who lives <; in
London and only spends a week-end in Bel-
fast when there is a c'hance of making
trouble there safely, has for quarter of a
century opposed every attempt to settle the
Irish question equitably and amicably. Be-
fore the war he had a sort of justification
on Imperial grounds for his opposition to
any form of Home Rule. But with the
German fleet gone Ireland becomes strate-
gically of far less importance. So much
so that, at a point, Downing-street ma^-
decide to let the uproarious place go. If
Carson’s blither on the 12th July last about
“calling out the Ulster volunteers materi-
alises and thus fosters a rebellion, and
if the British Government decides to get
from under and agree to separation, his
faithful Ulsterites will experience treat-
ment they would never have known under
Home Rule. The property, possibly the
lives, of many of them may be forfeited.
But Carson’s lucrative London Bar practice
will go on and his property —all of which as
in England—will be safe.
Auckland Geddes, speaking at W. M-
Hughes’s farewell in London, declared his
belief in Germany’s commercial formidable-
ness —that’s the way the cable put it for
she had now a depreciated currency and was
in an unrivalled position for commercial com-
petition. The U.S. viewpoint is much the
same: American commercial opinion is under
no illusions. Samuel Crowther, financial
editor of System, after a careful examina-
tion on the premises of Germany’s economic
condition, declared: —
The German trade of the future will not be as
dramatic as it has. been pictured. It will not be
dramatic at all. But because her merchants, bankers
and manufacturers have both feet squarely on the
ground and are prepared to go after profitable busi-
ness anywhere and on sane lines, Germany is to-day,
potentially, after the United State's, easily the big-
gest trade factor in the world. There is practically
nothing to undo anywhere in Germany in making
plans for the future—they do not have to go on a
peace basis, for the country, as a whole, has never
gone on a war basis in the manner of England,
France, and to some extent, the United States. Ger-
man labor costs are not as high as in other countries,
a wage of 20 marks a day being wholly exceptional
among skilled men.
Twenty marks is, on present exchange
values, equal to about Bs. In the absence of
an effective Commonwealth tariff, all this
is cold comfort to Australian manufacturers,
though it may be glorious news to certain
industrialists who are endeavoring to get
the stranglehold on Australian production.
Wilson’s capital, Washington, went dry
over a year ago. It has just registered the
biggest crime-wave in its history—lB7
criminal indictments in one week, 1G of
them for killings of the most •brutal type.
Several persons were beaten to death with
lead pipes. “Crimes involving violence are
invariably laid to intemperance by the Pro-
hibitionists,” says the New York Times. “If
the assaults and murders committed in sight
of the Capitol are to be thus accounted for,
it must be concluded that intemperance is
on the increase in Washington since the dis-
trict was voted dry, and Prohibition at the
very citadel of the Republic has proved a
miserable farce.”
N. S. Wales Government has got this far
with the big, vague idea of harnessing up
the Clarence River —Butters, general mana-
ger of Tasmania’s hydro-electric enterprise,
has been engaged to report. After which
he will go on to Europe to spend another
half-million on machinery for his own
show.
Though the Labor edifice in ‘ Victoria was
built upon craft unionism, the modern
Laborite has his own ideas about the
unionist’s claims to political consideration.
Under a rule introduced at the last State
conference, though a man belong to half a
dozen unions he can’t be elected to contest
a seat in Parliament unless he also has a
ticket in the A.L.P. But, unionist or not,
the man who pays 2s. a year to the A.L.P.
may put in for selection as often as he
likes, though that 2s. may represent his
whole contribution to Labor. In the old
days unionism sat tight at the Trades Hall
and did "its best to get an occasional rep.
into Parliament. By and bye the Political
Labor Council, its membership consisting
of anybody—man, woman or child —who
chose to sign a pledge and put down the
necessary contribution, came into the nest
and helped the unions to pick the Labor pea.
The possession of a union ticKee was then
enough to guarantee a candidate’s good faith
as a Laborite. Now the A.L.P. cuckoo is
political boss and the union-bird isn’t.
THE FAITHFUL PARTY MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
His virtue was a fealty strong,
A faithfulness like any dog's;
Although he often thought him wrong,
He always gave his vote to Bloggs;
One plain fact ever could he see—
That Blithers was flic enemy.
Whatever Blithers might propose
Would find him in his constant mood ;
With scornful bitterness he rose
To say the thing was no dashed good ;
And yet he praised it from his goul ‘
When Bloggs the thing from Blithers Stole.
It did not matter what was right .
Or what he’d promised to support;
For Bloggs obsessed his mental sight,
And everything beside was naught.
One creed possessed him, firm and strong,
That Bloggs was right and Blithers wrong.
Some people said that he had helped
Reform much needed to delay;
And like his leader, others yelped,
He changed hi's ideals in a day ;
But we who love the party plan
Esteem him as an ideal man.

PERCY PAWNTICKET.
STANZAS EMBODYING A SUGGESTION TO
COUNTERACT PREVAILING DISLOYALLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Protesting against the idea that we might get
along without imported State Governors the Argus
asserts that this would “weaken the chains that
bind the Empire.”
Let us, dear friends, be circumspect;
Disloyalty its fell trade plies.
Herein ’tis easy to detect.
A i wish to snap the Crimson Ties —
Six of the seven ties which keep
Us yoked with Bull across the deep!
Our fealty ’twere meet to show
By strengthening these bonds beloved ;
Old England would rejoice to know
That we, by loyal fervor moved,
Are willing, lest the Empire sway,
Six more State Governors to pay!

The I', and L. account shows a balance of
£160,544. This is reconciled with the figures
in the last line of the table as follows :
Balance as per P. and L. Account . . £160,544
Add Debenture interest paid . . . . 68,338
£228,882
Less Provident Fund grant .. £2OOO
Less Bonus to staff . . .. 3932

It is thus assumed that the bonus to staff
will this year amount to the same as in
the previous year. In fact, in the table the
bonus is charged to the year in which it is
actually paid.
In common with all other cos. in this
pastoral-agency business, Goldsbrougii Mort s
have had a rattling good time. The wool
clips have been bought by the British Gov-
ernment ; hut these cos. were much too
influential to be allowed to suffer on account
of a little thing like that. They made their
money as usual, helped thereto by the ex-
ceptional price paid for the clips. And it
looks as if still higher prices will be paid.
Meantime in other lines the commissions
have been just as sweet; and the profits on
the co.’s own properties must have gilded
the lily—or greased the fat pig, whichever
you like. The co. seems also to have sold
some more of its station property ; and it
can hardly have made a loss on that either,
or on the re-purchase of a little more of its
own debenture stock, seeing that the bulk
of it carries only 4 p.c.
The movements in the grouped balance-
sheet items are shown in the next com-
parison :
1908. 1918. 1919.

Premises, etc. . . 300,388 266,024 264,653
Reserves there, along with other items, are
as at March 31, before the annual appro-
priations, but after paying the interim
dividends at the rate lately of 10 p.c. p.a.
The most excellent feature of the finance is
the very small amount of “other liabilities.”
What money other than its own the co.
uses in the business is almost all fixed-
the only safe plan in a concern which
finances an industry liable to such quick
changes of fortune as stock-raising in the
droughty parts of Australia. It was be-
cause the co. was not in a good position to
argue with its creditors that it got into
very serious trouble in the ’nineties, and
incidentally made many enemies in its
struggle to put itself right. And this fix-
ture of capital is a good thing for clients
as well as for shareholders: it at least
gives a desirable borrower a chance of -hold-
ing on and letting the turn of the seasons
help him back on to his feet.
All is fish that comes to Goldsbrough-Mort’s
net: and it has had for many years rn
interest in minerals as well as merinos.
Sometimes it hasn’t been easy to say where
it left off and Mt. Morgan started. But the
copper business hasn’t been as easy as the
wool. That, however, is due mainly to
bungling on the part of the Commonwealth
Government - , whose other name is Hughes.
There is no big copper producer in Aus-
tralia which hasn’t at least six months’
metal on its hands'; and every one of them
tells the same story—they haven’t been able
to place their product. This can be set
down at once as plain nonsense. The whole
of the stocks in Australia could be disposed
of inside a month if the Government took
its hands off. To suppose that there are
not men in the world who would be pre-
pared to speculate to the extent of 20 or 30
thousand tons of copper is absurd.
Early last year this co. issued, one bonus
share for every 10 old ones, being careful
to say that they were paid for out of profits
made prior to" June, 1914. There may be
something else in the wind. At any rate,
power has now been taken to increase the
nominal capital from the present £798.565 in
£l, shares to £1,000,000 by the creation of
201.435 new £1 shares. The present sub-
scribed capital is £773,010, so there wasn’t
room for another bonus issue without
this increase. And in these days the
co, which has large reserves and in
consequence pays what looks like an ex-
cessive rate of dividend is courting trouble.
In this case the 15 p.c. div. is equal to only
about 8 p.c. on capital and reserves com-
bined. Nor can it be said that the reserves
have been made out of the public; for a
considerable part of them came from the
sale of properties which were written down
when the old capital was reduced.

Note first that the last line covers a year’s
trading as against a half-year in previous
lines; and then glance down at the next
table to observe a considerable change in
the shipping item. The co. has been run-
ning a swarm, of mosquito boats to the
North Coast, mostly for its own trade, but
not wholly. The North Coast S. N. Co.
was glad to see a competitor out of the
way: and possibly this co. was glad to get
a worrying business off its hands. Any-
way, it sold three of its old cockles and
a new one to the North Coast Co.; and
how much of the profit shown for the year
comes from this deal The Bulletin doesn’t
know. The balance-sheet figures compare
with their predecessors this way:—

If has always been understood that the co.
kept its assets written down pretty hard;
and even coastal ships cost probably 80 p.c.
more than they did seven years ago. Thus
nearly half of the profit shown as made
during the year might easily have flown
from this deal; but no I\ and L. account
is published to guide one in the matter. No
doubt, thanks in part to the State timber
yard, which is reputed to have actually
taken the lead at times in putting up prices
of building timber, this trade has continued
wonderfully profitable; but nobody is just-
ified in assuming that this co.’s normal
profits have lately almost doubled. Then,
assuming that profit has been made by the
sale of assets, and that this profit has been
included in the total, a further point has to
be considered: the North Coast Co. has
“undertaken all our freight requirements
from northern ports previously served by
these steamers,” but presumably the price
will be based on the sum paid for the
vessels. So it may easily happen that future
profits have been prejudiced by the sale.
However,- one needn’t look for any slump
straight away. The world is much too mad
to realise the position it is in. This country
certainly is; and England is far Worse.
Until it recovers there will be extravagances
of all sorts and in all sorts of places; and
an extra shilling or two on a stick won’t
matter. But it is going to matter by and
bye.
Bes'des the liquid assets shown in the
second comparison above, the Allen Taylor
Co. has £32.500 to credit of an insurance
and reserve fund. This is all invested out-
side the business, and all but £4250 is in
deposits or public securities. The £4250 is
all or mostly in the South Coast shipping
co. Taylor’s now have a finger in the cos.
trading both ways out of Sydney, though
apparently it gets its seat on the Board of
the North Coast Co. without making a pur-
chase of shares.

Five years ago Sydney Chamber of Manu-
factures decided that the insurance cos.
were on too good a wicket so fat- as work-
men’s compensation policies were concerned,
so this little mutual office was formed to
hold on to some of the profits for policy-
holders. The table indicates how successful
the , enterprise has been, though it tells only
mart of the story. For workmen’s compen-
sation isn’t quite- as sweet a thing as it used
to be. To begin with, two years ago a new
Act providing considerably increased advan-
tages superseded the old one. At the same
time the proprietary concerns, instead of
increasing their tariffs to meet the addi-
tional risks, got cold feet, partly as a result
of the Government monopoly created by the
Queensland Act, and partly because of the
operations of this and other mutual cos.,
and rates were actually reduced by about
one-third. The Manufacturers’ Mkitual
also adopted the new standard rates; and
the result has been a higher loss ratio and
a smaller margin of profit-

Gross income in 1917 was £I6,S!)S and pro-
fits £10.641, equal to almost 63 p.c. For
the past year premiums and interest brought
in £27,602, but profits (£11.330) had been
shaved to 41 p.c.
Incidentally, these profits are shown after
giving the Chamber of Manufactures a cut
for standing fairy godmother to the scheme.
The Chamber gets £3OO this ..year; and so
far the parent body’s funds have benefited
by £750. Of the past yeai-’s surplus of
£11,330, £4OOO has been tacked on to con-
tingency reserves (making them £8200) and
£lO4O has been added to the reserve for
unexpired risks (now £10,588). Even then
there was sufficient profit remaining to pay
the usual 10 pm. dividend, to rebate some-
thing like. 4s. in the £ of premiums and
leave over £9OO of profit untouched. Dur-
ing its five years the office has collected
£84,700 in premiums anu made a profit of
nearly £48,000. Of this about £28,000 has
gone back to jpoliOy holders and iinfco
Chamber funds, leaving the £19,601 of re-
serves shown in the first table.
At April 30, apart from £4097 of unad-
justed claims, the office owed only £1593.
As for funds, they are excellently placed.
Of the £36.304 of assets no less than
£34,939 is represented by War Loan, de-
posits and cash.

Still dry, the profits being required for de-
veloping the estates; and the directors, not
being of the market-making sort, can’t see
much in paying dividends and making calls
simultaneously. The profits don’t, in fact,
meet the bill for development. Last year
£7 10s. per share, equal to £7500, was
called; this current year it is intended io
get in a similar amount, which will make
the £lOO shares paid to £B5. The co. now
owes about £5 10s. in excess of more or less
liquid assets, and has only £22 10s. more
to call up per share; and probably with a
view to keeping a bit in hand the manage-
ment has come to the conclusion that
development had better stop at 4000 acres.
There are 3959 acres already under crop,
3769 acres carrying cocoanuts and 190
acres rubber. The co.’s total holding is about
50,000 acres, some freehold, some 999 years
lease; and 4000 acres don’t make much cf
a hole in that lot. But labor is the trouble.
The Solomon Islander might be the model
which the I.W.W. keeps before it. His
motto is: “Why work when you can loaf
and still live?” At one time the co. had
hopes of being allowed to bring in labor if
it couldn’t convert the local population; but
the Government won’t hear of it. Even to
maintain the present force of about 355
laborers calls for a good deal of exertion;
last year, for instance, 225 completed their
time and were paid off, and 223 were en-
gaged. The unexpired proportion of engage-
ment expenses stands among the assets at
£3l39—over £8 per head of the present
labor force. The management confesses at
last that the difficulty “appears to be per-
manent” ; so the 4000 acres stands as the
present limit.
Presuming that the co. will be able to
get enough labor to work the 4000 acres—
and in the job of keeping the plantations
clean it has the help of a gradually increas-
ing herd of cattle—shareholders should soon
be handling moderate dividends. For four
years past the crop has been as follows: —
Copra. Rubber.
3 91« .. 192 tom) 4171 b.
1917 .. 274 ~ 1414,,
1918 .. 301 „ 2389 „
1919 .. 476 „
Last year it didn’t seem worth while tap-
ping the rubber trees at the price offering;
though no doubt if suitable labor had been
available the case would have been different.
This current year they may ship anything
up (o 000 tons copra ; and with the freight
difficulty easier the co. might, with reason-
able luck, show £lO,OOO to the good. In
1914, when it showed £4871, and paid a 10
p.c. div. on the then capital, it harvested
only 101 tons. Still that proportion can’t
be maintained. For one thing it used to
cost about £5 to recruit a “boy” on a three-
year indenture: now it costs £lO to land
him for two years. And there are fewer
boys to make “trade” profit out of.

The high cost of starched collars, and the
slow recognition on the part of managements
that even a clerk is the better for three
meals a day, has at last driven bank staffs
to try a little co-operation. The prospectus
setting out the objects of the United Bank
Officers’ Association is a timid little docu-
ment, almost apologetic because it is “neces-
sary under the Arbitration Acts of this
country to register as a union.” However,
the money-jugglers have decided that it is
good enough to get in the procession with
public servants, journalists and others who
have tasted the sweets of unionism. All the
grievances which have been stored up for
years are to be given an airing at an early
meeting of bank-men. For a start the
Association hopes to see what can be done
with the managements by the Whitley
method; failing that, the Arbitration Court
is certain to be asked to make an award.

Besides the old-established enterprise at
Marino and the projected enterprise on
Kangaroo Island, S. Aus. has cement works
at Birkenhead, close to Port Adelaide, on
which the Adelaide Cement Co. has spent
about £120,000. The co. is now about five
years old, and, although the works will
presently be capable of doubling their out-
put, the turnover is already about £50,000
a year, of which nearly four-fifths is paid
out for labor of one sort and another. New
plant which cost £56,000 is only awaiting
a power unit to get into action. The co. is
in 105,745 £1 ordinaries, and £5OOO 10 p.c.

“W.C.M.”: As an accountant I have
numerous income-tax returns to prepare,
particularly those of graziers and farmers;
and again and again I find my clients called
upon to pay tax on income which is not
in their possession. Natural increase of
livestock has to be included as income; yet
the record of any three years includes
almost always at least one year in which
a big loss is made owing'to drought or the
ravages of flies or floods. A grazier has
on hand at' the end of one year 10.000
lambs, which reckoned at 9s. per head show
him a profit of £4500. On this he has to
pay tax. Next year or the year after, when
these lambs should be income-producers, a
drought or a flood or somethirig else kills
most of them, ' while he has no natural
increase that year to balance the loss. This
loss of income is not allowed as a set-off
against the 'previous year’s profit. Thus
he has paid tax on profits which he never
realises. The same thing applies to the
cattleman, whose calves are not revenue-
producing until they are at least three
years old. The Queensland Income Tax Act
permits graziers to be assessed on their
receipts and expenditure only, should they
desire it; but the Federal Act makes no
such provision. The British system is to
base the tax on a three-years’ history; and
that is infinitely more equitable' than our
own.


The advantage of having battery charging current
on tap in the home garage is now within the reach
of every motorist. The G.E. Mercury Arc Battery
Charger makes any ordinary lighting circuit a source
of energy for starting, lighting, and ignition bat-
teries. Its cost is a mere trifle compared with the
convenience and economy of home charging. An
overnight boosting charge every few weeks will not
only increase the efficiency of a battery, but will
also lengthen the life of the plates. You should

From Cloncurry (Q.) : Owing to the
cessation of all smelting and the curtailment
of mining operations, extreme depression
prevails throughout the district. Further,
it is exceedingly difficult to forecast when
smelting is likely to be resumed. Any con-
siderable revival in mining depends a good
deal on the extension of the railway to the
Gulf, with a branch line to Mt. Oxide.
Mt. Elliott, Ltd., has offered to advance the
State £300,000 towards the construction of
this line. Elliott would almost certainly
proceed with a policy of vigorous develop-
ment simultaneously with the railway ex-
tension, and probably also erect large treat-
ment works in the vicinity of the town of
Cloncurry, scrapping the present plant at
Selwyn. The co.’s smelting operations last
year were principally confined to, ascertain-
ing whether the vast tonnage of lhw and
medium grade ores available could be suc-
cessfully treated. This was clearly proved
beyond all doubt, notwithstanding the ad-
verse conditions of the campaign: small
tonnages, war cost of materials and labor
scarcity. For the 15 months to the end of
March the grade of ore put through the
smelters averaged only 4.6 p.c. (extraction),
compared with 10 p.c. and over in all pre-
vious campaigns. All the co.’s mines with-
out exception have responded to develop-
ment, and Mt. Oxide, practically a virgin
mine, now shows over 300,000 tons 10 p.c.
ore available for immediate treatment, with
every prospect of the reserves being in-
creased to millions of tons when develop-
ment has been advanced.
* * * *
Recent developments in the Kalkadoon
have changed the whole outlook for Mt.
Cuthbert (Q-) - Prior to these discoveries
the prospects were anything but bright,
and Cuthbert could be classed merely
as a low-grade show, with treatment works
quite inadequate to ensure financial success.
The latest official estimate of the new make
in the Kalkadoon is 2500 tons copper*above
the 150 ft. level. Ore up to 20 p.c. has been
raised. Meantime at the Little Wonder the
No. 1 level at 100 ft. has been driven about
70ft. on the lode, which is from 3ft. to 4ft.
wide. The Orphan is opened up a length
of 340 ft. at the 175 ft. level, giving an esti-
mated 800 tons copper.
In the last 28 years gold dividends
amounting to £27.500,000 have been pa:d in
Westralia. Eighty-nine cos. shared in the
distribution, the record year being 1890,
when over two millions were handed out.
Kalgoorlie’s contributors number 13, and
their return to shareholders aggregates over
£21,000,000. or more than three-fourths of
the total. Only about 10 of the aforesaid
89 are left, and more than half of them are
at Kalgoorlie. Four or five of these have
many years of profitable life ahead of them.
There are several mines in the West that
are calling loudly for reports by independ-
ent experts. Ohe is the Riverina South.
In the last four years promise after promise
made to shareholders has been unfulfilled.
Calls have been swallowed up, liabilities
have steadily mounted, while assets have
shrunk into invisibility. Yet despite the
show’s dismal record the Board is still pro-
phesying a brighter future and again appeal-
ing for funds. Another doubtful proposition
is the Mararoa’s Light of Asia show at Cue.
It had been worked almost to a standstill
when the Mararoa got it, and the ■ ground
since opened up does not anoear to have
revealed anything of much value. Moreover,
recent returns from the residues indicate
that the latter are not as valuable as. antici-
pated. It is time that shareholders insisted
on some independent expert telling them
what their holding is really worth. The
same remark applies to Battler’s option
near Southern Cross, and particularly as
to whether the erection of a mill to crush
the short shoots of ore now exposed and
which the co. hopes to expose would be
warranted.
* * * *
One by one the old familiar Westralian
gold-mines are passing into the hands, of
tributors. Last year Gt. Fingall, Boulder
Perseverance, Associated Northern, Oroya
Links and Ida H. were added to the list,
and for some time past portions of the
Associated 'and Lake View have been handed
over. Some tributors have done so well that
irate English shareholders are demanding an
explanation as to how their managements
came to overlook these rich patches.
* * * *
As usual, chairman F. A. Govett dealt
with many things at the Ivanhoe meeting.
To begin with he rejoiced that, despite the
sickly appearance of the bottom workings,
reserves were still four years ahead of the
mill, and, besides, there was a lot of pay-
able rock in sight which had not been taken
into account. Then there were the more' or
less valuable residues with which the slopes
were tilled in the early days, and the ore
left behind in the walls of the stopes in
rimes when only high-grade stuff was
wanted. He read letters of recent date
from the manager stating that some of the
old fillings taken out had assayed from 11s.
to 60s. per ton, that ore worth 455. per
ton had been found in the old stopes, and
that some assayed up to 180 s. Reference
was also made to one block of ore con-
taining between 40 and 50 thousand tons,
and estimated to be worth from 30s. to 355.,
which had never been included in the re-
serves. Having cheered up shareholders
with these prospects, Govett proceeded to
praise the past year’s developments on the
east branch lode, which he declared made a
very substantial addition to the mill’s
sources of supply. He, however, confessed
that in order to maintain the present profit
ore of a grade above the average of the
reserves was being treated. Dealing with
the industrial strife common in most .coun-
tries, Govett confessed that a lot of the
trouble would have been avoided if employers
had only taken labor more into their con-
fidence and given it a bigger cut out of their
earnings. Unfortunately at this late stage
in the history of Kalgoorlie little could be
done in this direction, for profits were
steadily dwindling, and in most cases there
were none at all.
Fred Tricks, after specialising at West-
onia, is going strong around Southern
Gross (W.A.). After picking up the Old
Trafalgar for the Edna May Battlers when
that show had given Westonia best, he has
landed the ill-fated Empress from Mt. Mag-
net to the Desert Gold lease, eight miles
from Southern Cross. Dick Williams does
the paternal here as well as for Battlers,
being known as the supervisor—beautiful
word that! He has bumped three shallow
potholes down to an average depth of about
60ft. to find that his pan samples go about
SdVvt.; and-at the bottom of the shafts he
testifies to some of lOdwt. This is good
enough if the battery cracks stuff up to this
average. But will it? So many Westonia
pan-tests looked silly when the stampers
spoke that it is early yet to whoop.
Looking at the average of the ground
treated by both Nos. 1 and 2 plants at
Adelong Creek (N.S.W.) last half-year, the
wonder is the co. did not do better finan-
cially. Even Nd. 1, which was supposed to
have hunted in poor dirt, was in 6jd. wash,
while No. 2 at times switched into lOfd.
dirt, coming out with an average of Sid.
for the 257,200 cubic yards it handled. What
clipped profits was the.soaring price of iron
and steel. Result, No.-l plant’s costs aver-
aged 4.9 d. per cubic yard and No. 2’s 41d.
Repairs and maintenance swallowed £4664,
against the actual working outgo of £4072.
Two-thirds of every ounce won was required
to keep things on the go. In all £4474 was
netted for the term ; and instead of splash-
ing this up in divs. Gordon Lyon liquidated
debentures. That debt is now down to
under £4OOO. With No. 1 dred? o ; n b°r<-«r
ground shareholders may expect divs. again.
* * * *
White Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), had
a bank balance of only £2966 left at the end
of the financial year ended June 7 out of
all the call money got in for the previous
12 months, as well as £3616 received for the
28 tons concentrates. A fair sum was spent
on development, and the management now
claims that sufficient ore is in sight to
keep the stamps going three shifts. Since
the end of the year another parcel of con-
centrates has been sold, and a further parcel
will be ready soon. There is a whisper of
a dividend, but though shareholders cer-
tainly deserve some return for the calls they
have paid into the Co . through its various
reconstructions, a distribution at this stage
can serve no other purpose than to prop up
the market. Supporters s*e some promise
in Crosby’s Hill, which attracted geologist
Harper’s attention, but that is a gamble.
A nearly empty dam at Ardlethan, ’flu and
no outlet for its-ore except the obsolescent
Barmedman battery, are some of the
troubles that the Carpathia has had to face
lately. The Ardlethan plant is laid up by
the general thirst, and the Sydney Export
Co. has not treated the parcels of roasted
ore which it has on its floors. The ’flu is
blamed for this delay as well, but the ques-
tion of getting molybdenite concentrates up
to 90 p c. has probably given the Svdney
Export Co. more trouble than the eirdemic.
Meantime additional plant is being installed
at Ardlethan.
* * * #
Concerning a gold “flotation” project:—
1 Shoalhaven River (N.S.W.) alluvial deposit is one
of the most extensive in the world —miles of river
flats with great depths of wash and of wide ter-
races with clean wash from top to bottom, in some
places 200 ft. The whole mass is gold-bearing. It
is very poor, though, and all attempts to work it at
a profit have failed. Yet in California and -M.L.
poorer deposits have been made to pay. The difficulty
ia in saving a reasonable percentage of the gold.
By attrition the metal has been flattened out and
broken up into small particles of the finest gold-
leaf. Were it granular, no matter how fine, there
would have to be something radically wrong with
the mechanical treatment if a payable proportion
of it could not be recovered. For over 50 miles
along the course of the river there are relics of
plants of all descriptions mocking man’s efforts to
make the “float” gold sir.k.
The most ambitious attempt to deal with the
proposition was that engineered many years ago »y
J. C. F. Johnson and Tom Barnfield, of Adelaide.
With races around the terraces and fluming across
the ravines they brought the water to a favorite
point over 200 ft. from bedrock. Giant nozzles carry-
ing high pressures dislodged the wash in enormous
quantities, and an auxiliary water supply of large
volume dashed on to this and washed it into
the races leading to the river. Everything in
the way of facility for cheap working was
there; but after a few weeks’ run the scheme
vanished like the mists from the nozzles. There
was no report as . to what the first and only
clean-up returned. Johnson admitted that it .vas
the disappointment of his life; but in a book pub-
lished long after the failure of his syndicate he
expressed a high opinion of the possibilities of the
place—these “truly enormous drifts must in the
near future add largely to the world’s gold supply.”
The next big effort was made by a syndicate
which had for its engineer no less a mining per-
sonage than “Black Jack” Collins—he who was
politely recalled from Lucknow (N.S.W.) because
he produced over a ton of gold in a month without
thinking it necessary to give a preliminary hint
to the directors that such a sensational return was
likely. He claimed to have had special experience
“down Sacramento Valley” in handling float-gold pro-
positions, and benighted Australian mining men
were to be taught much-needed lessons. He con-
structed his races with a series of short drops, and
in holes at the bottom of these he placed quick-
silver, of which it was said at the time he used
over five tons. Theoretically this was a most
feasible scheme. Everything went smoothly in the
dislodging and washing down of the drift, and a
big yardage was treated. The. first clean-up ended
the venture.
Despite the consistent record of failures there is
always some genius anxious - to demonstrate that he
has tf the secret which will save the gold. It may
be that that genius has now arrived. At any rate,
a company is being, formed in Sydney to make an
attempt to deal with the proposition; and if it
can save 60 p.e. of the gold at 50 p.c. advance
on its estimated costs, it will make a profit. “Mac-
quarie-street” is speculating largely in the enter-
prise. The doctoi'3 have, as a class, been the
pluckiest and least lucky of mining speculators in
the State and they have been the most cheerful
of losers. They deserve all the! luck this time.

The Golden One, Bendigo, was about as
flattened out as the saddles in the country
it was prodding for anticlines and synclines,
so Sam Barnes has come to the rescue with
£5OO of Mines Department money. This is
to go in shaft-sinking on the Christmas side-
line and on the Don claim. Named after
Lady Don, who entertained the early dig-
gers, the mine has had many downs and
ups. Billy Oundy’-s history narrates that
19.4 r T> tons were shot out of workings down
to 330 ft. for 6988}0z. gold. To the ever-
recurring inquiry as to why the old hands
chucked up the sponge at 330 ft., Cundy’s
reply is that divs. were soaked up then as
eagerly as they are to-day; and wdien
progressive work was needed the necessary
was not forthcoming. The last flutter in
the Don was when Bendigo broker Harri-
son. chairman of the co., and now a staff
officer somewhere, went to work under-
ground to. prove that he was as able-bodied
as any miner on the field. As he returned
to the Mall the toughs of those days sar-
castically remarked that there couldn’t be
much gold below or he would never have
left the mine. So the co. dr’fted to the
hammer. On the reef 650 ft- of sloping on
Tdwt. dirt shows that there is a fair snort-
ing chance for the Golden One if its props
are able to bear the strain of putting in a
couple of lifts of 80ft. each.
* * * •
New Ruby Flat, Bradshaw’s Creek
(Tas.), had a parched run during the half
ended May 31, and bagged only £1507 worth
t n. After paying exes £231 remained, so
divs. also dried up. There are 24.370 paid
£1 shares, and the 30th sixpenny was passed
out in September last. After the accounts
closed the show became moist again, and
manager John Auton was able to get his
newly-installed blower at work. With a
healthy market and payable ground ahead
divs. should show up again soon if there is
sufficient water to feed the nozzles. -The co.
has no financial worries; at May 31 it owed
only £"0 and coiOd write a cheque for £lBl.

Arba (Tas.) thinks it has secured a new
lease of life on its area near the cemeterv.
The channel has apparently turned abruptly
to the right, and some first-class tin drifts
have been exposed. Still, only one chain of
ground has been opened up, and more work
is required to make certain that the lend is
continuous. The Arba has only 60,000
shares of Bs. each, and has long since re-
turned shareholders’ capital.

Andy McKissock, who fell in the fight he
put up against flumonia at Ballarat, was one
of the best-liked of the Labor men who have
sat in the Vic. Assembly. He was in that
House as member for Ballarat West from
1908 till 1911, coming to the green benches
from the lino, at Ballarat, and was already
regarded as one of the reasonable bunch
who own a thinking apparatus and not
merely a parrot tongue. From 1914 till
1917 he was a Senator, and latterly was a
leader in the Vic-Riverina branch of the
A.W.U. He was only middle-aged, and his
career was apparently not all behind him
when ? flu made its attack. Indeed, he stood
an excellent chance of being selected by
Labor to run for the Senate at next elec-
tion.
“Bunbury”: The south-west of Westralia
is the place to grow old in. Before Bunbury
was, M. W. Clifton founded Australind for
the old W. A. Company. The third or
fourth immigrant ship to arrive was the
Diadem, on April 10, 1842. That is 77
years ago, and five of the passengers are
still living here, or, at least, were a few
days ago. One flickered out on July 6.
He was William
Jenkin Roberts,
who came from
Cornwall as a
boy of 15, and
lived to celebrate
his 91st birthday
in March last.
His fellow-pas-
sengers still liv-
ing are his sis-
ters, 87 and 85 re-
spectively ; Mrs.
Thos. Marriott
of Brunswick,
96; and Mrs.
Jackson, of Yar-
loop. There are
half a dozen other
people in the dis-
trict who are
verging on the
100 mark. Octo-
genarians are not
so frequently met
with. Most of
them enlisted.
GENERAL
RICHARDSON,
newly appointed
officer in charge
of Maoriland
Defence Adminis-
iration.
To enable the congestion of business in
Vic. Supreme Court to be coped with
W. J. Schutt and F. W. Mann have been
appointed Judges at a salary of floOO each.
Mann has had a phenomenal rise. A few
years ago he was an officer with a small
salary in the Crown Law Department; but
he is both able and industrious, and de-
serves all his success. Schutt’s late father
was librarian in the Supreme Court library,
and Bernard O’Dowd (before he took up
drafting bills) served under him. The new
appointments were considered urgent, as
Hodges is very ill, Irvine will not be able
to take any Criminal Court work while he
is Acting-Governor, and Cussen has to finish
the consolidation of the Statutes, and when
he gets through that work is to be given
extended furlough. Schutt and Mann have
shaped well in Supreme and High Court
practice, but it was hardly thought their
promotion would come so soon, as they are
comparatively young barristers.
Death notice from London Times
(2/5/’l9) : —-
TUCK. —On the 12th Anril, at Sydney, Australia,
after a short illness, Hugo Tuck, voungest son of
the late Kaphael Tuck, in his 58th year. Deepiy
, mourned. (By cable.)
“D.F.”: One of the men who made the
wonderful boat voyage from Port Jackson to
Timor in 1791 (B. 10/7/’l9) came back to
settle in N. S. Wales. This was John Butcher,
who was allowed to enlist in the N.S.W.
Corps, and in September, 1795, was granted
25 acres at Peter-
sham Hill. In a
letter ,to Secre-
tary Dundas,
written in New-
gate Gaol on
January 23. 1793,
Butcher said that
if he were allow-
ed to go out as a
settler he could
show the colony
some points in
raising wheat,
maize, rye, bar-
ley, beans and
grass. The of-
fence for which
he was given his
first trip had an
agricultural fla-
vor —stealing pigs
at Shrewsbury.
T. WALSH,
General Secretary
of the Federated
Seamen’s Union.
From the Federal Gallery:—
Michael Patrick Considine, who is alleged to have
spoken disaffectedly the other day, was originally
intended for the Church, but a craving for argument
and a wider world pushed him into the Labor move-
ment. Reps, on both sides know him as a devout
family man and a very good fellow, and I have
even heard the eminent Jowett declare that Mick
was “not half a bad chap at heart.” In this sort
of apologetic reference one detects an implication
that radicalism is usually associated with bigamy,
arson and embezzlement in private life, though, as
a matter of fact, social rebels like Considine are
generally unimpeachable citizens. Among all the
Federal politicians I have encountered, Michael is
the politest and most uncommon. His relentless
hatchet face, curious gliding walk, and suggestion
of having learnt his hairdressing in Fiji hardly com-
mend him to people who like undistinguished noses
and ingrowing chins. All the same, he is an in-
herently refined young man, with a large quantity
of valuable knowledge waiting ready for use. With
fine irony the alleged Bolshevik selected for his
place of residence Culshaw-street, Toorak.
Frank Paton, just elected Westralian
M.L.C. for Fremantle and thereabouts, is
a youngish old-warrior who has done many
public jobs. Born in 1877 he left his native
Creswick (Vic.) in the ’nineties, and when
the Boer War started was one of the first
from Australia to be there. He settled in
Fremantle on his return, and for years took
a prominent part in union matters at that
port. He faced the Huns for two years
in France, and then brought home several
wounds and bits of shrapnel. When in
France he was put up against Fowler for
the Perth Federal seat, but Fowler won
easily. He is president of the State Labor
Federation.
“Adah” lets down the shutters: —
The antiquary is a rare bird in Sydney ; yet dusty
old Phillip-street had two blood-brothers and twin-
souls. Nominally only one, the younger, kept “Ye
Olde China Shoppe” in the little old house at No.
58 ; but actually both were bound up heart and soul
in the love of everything old. Things that found
their way into their shop did not have to be rare
and exquisite to give them a place in the old men's
affections. Anything and everything was welcome
so long as it bore the cachet of antiquity. But the
“Shoppe” was, after all, only the business side of
their lives. Their supreme treasures filled every corner
of the house they called their home. Its presiding
deity was a sixteenth-century china figure of the
Chinese goddess Kwan-yiu, placed in the inner sanc-
tuary of a room dedicated to relics of the Orient.
There were sacred lamps of brass, cabinets inlaid
with faded ivory, curiosities beautiful and unbeauti-
ful, but all interesting. No woman was thought
worthy to look after these treasures. Rather than
trust them to the careless hand of womankind, John
and William did their own housekeeping. Sunday
morning was devoted to dusting the collection, the
numberless pieces of china, the Sheraton furniture —
including the sideboard much coveted by Dame
Melba to hold her collection of jade-handled knives,
as William was fond of explaining as he showed off
this very handsome piece. And never was there a
more hospitable pair. To show their old china, to
Jell the dates and the marks and the history of each
item with a little set ritual of action and word, was
the greatest pleasure of their lives. They never
tired of handling the things and telling the history,
and when the showing was over the hospitable old
fellows would have an inviting supper spread in the
dining-room with a truly feminine attention to de-
tail, as if the genius of the house had been a capable
housewife and not a china goddess 400 years old.
The brothers are gone now. No more will John and
William Biggs show their treasures. John, the anti-
quary of Phillip-street, without forewarning, died in
his sleep last Christmas night; and William, the
elder brother, was as one who had lost his other
half. Nothing could fill his brother’s place in his
life, and last week he followed into the shadows.
Art collectors will miss from the little Phillip-street
house the gentle, simple old men who literally lived
and had their being in the handicrafts of other
times.
Stricken down with paralysis—it is
officially described as a slight cerebral seizure
—the knighted Justice Ilodges is compelled
now to take the rest to which he was entitled
but which he denied himself. He is 75', has
been 30-years on the Vic. bench, and is well
endowed. If only for three months, he would
have liked to be Chief Justice, but the fates
were against him. Still fresh in the
memory of the older members of the Bar
is the scene between his Honor and J. L.
Purves, in the Criminal Court. J.L. would
not bend the knee when he ruffled the Judge’s
plumage, and the Sheriff was sent for. But
with tears in their voices Judge and bar-
rister settled their difference without the jo-
operation of the demander of bodies for the ,
gallows.
A. C. Willis, czar of the Coal-miners’
Federation, appeared in two characters one
day last week. As a revolutionist he was
expelled from the Labor party; as a capi-
talist he was fined for not sending in an
income-tax return.
McKinstry, one of the lately-appointed
Vie. Electricity Commissioners, has thrown
up his job, as he has better fish to fry in
England. He sailed on July 14. The West-
inghouse Co.’s representative in Victoria,
he did some good work on one of the tech-
nical boards for the Federal Government
during the war-time. Lyle and Swinburne;
the other two Commissioners, are running
the show for the present, and incidentally
warming their offices with primitive kerosene-
heaters.
The latest to be pushed into the limelight as
the most ancient living Melbourne native is
81-year-old Henry Kettle, whose claim is sup-
ported by an entry in the Family Bible,
certifying that the infant was born on July
14, 1838. at “the town of Melbourne, New
South Wales,” the item being signed by
William Waterfield, “Protestant Dissenting
Minister.” The old inhabitant now lives
at Gisborne, over to the north of the Keilor
Plains.
Passed out at 68, Charles Krushka. Born
in the Speck, as a youngster he went witli
his brother to the gold diggings at Mathin-
na. From there they trailed to the East
Coast, prospecting for tin, and did very
well out of a claim at Main Creek, which
they called the Black Bay. A little later
they discovered The Brothers Home, which
returned them 4000 tons of tin and a profit
of something like £400,000. They sold out
to the Briseis Co. for £35,000. Krushka
then took up some of the rich Eingarooma
land, calling it the Pleasant Banks estate.
He died there. For many years he has
usually had a racehorse or two in training.
’Flu left some harrowing domestic
tragedies behind it in Sydney. There was
the case of the Hills household. W. E.
Hills, a highly capable office-organiser, was
secretary of various mining cos. of which
the Freemans have control. Fie died first.
Within ,a week his young wife and their
first-born infant were being mourned for,
too.
Died last week, aged 82. F. W. Webb,
formerly Clerk of N. S. Wales Assembly,
who retired in 1904 to potter about among
his beloved native flowers and bushes at
North Harbor. The son of an old civil
servant —the father was at one time Super-
intendent at Norfolk Island —he moved for
some years between Parliament House and
the Post Office before settling down among
the politicians. He was a model of urban-
ity in even the stormiest conditions.
William Smythe, of the Customs Depart-
ment. who has died in Sydney at 83, was
probably the last living witness of the
execution of John Knatchbull, in January,
1844; he went to see the hanging when he
should have gone to school. Around the
sordid story of Knatclibull, a member of
one of the oldest families in England, fic-
tionists have built many stories but the
murder of the widowed shopkeeper was
really the meanest sort of crime. Robert
Lowe, afterwards Lord Sherbrooke, defended
the murderer and worked hard to save his
neck, but without avail. Though Lady
GinDS was a connection of KnatehbuH’s and
supplied him with the suit of black broad-
cloth in which he was hanged, her hus-
band, the Governor, signed the death-
warrant.
THE LAST PROFITEER.
“The price I paid for a double grave seven
years ago was £3 2s. 6d. Last week when I made
'inquiry for a similar lot I was informed that the
price would be £22 5s.”-t— Sydney Telegraph
correspondent.
SHADE OF JONES : “Yom here, too! I thought
I had escaped at last!”
South Aus. is to lose Capt. Clare, its
Naval Commandant. Born at sea 00 years
ago, he has been in Australian waters since
1880. At first in charge of the official picnic
boat Governor Musgrave, he succeeded Cres-
well as Commandant, just in time to take
the S'.A. “fleet” —the gunboat Protector
to China for the Boxer rising. Bracegirdle,
who is to replace him in Adelaide, is a
sailor of 38, Sydney-born, and with a war
record embracing China, S’Africa, New
Guinea, Gallipoli, Suez and Palestine.
S. Australia still takes pleasure in the
company of an old lady who arrived in the
province six weeks before the Buffalo, which
brought the man who “proclaimed” the
colony. She is Mrs. Helen Mantegani, the
youngest daughter of Robert Thomas, who
was the founder of the press in S. Aus.
Actually, in fact, the .Register was first
produced in England, and circulated among
the people who contemplated emigrating to
the new colony. A grandson of the founder
—the old lady’s nephew—is the representa-
tive of the original family in the present
firm. Mrs. Mantegani is 94.
Just-dead Lieut-Col. (Dr.) Perkins.
D. 5.0., of Sydney, was nearly shot west
19 years ago-during the Boer War. Whilst
on a trek he got separated from the column,
was cut off and captured. On reaching the
Boer laager his ambulance was searched
and they found a rifle and ammunition.
This angered the capturing Boers so much
that they clamored for his prompt execution.
Fortunately one of the captors recognised
him as the doctor who had treated his
wounds after a previous engagement. He
pleaded hard for the Australian, and ulti-
mately won. Perkins was released and re-
joined his column. His own explanation
(certainly true) was that he had hoped to
get a shot at a passing buck. But it was
a horrible risk to take.
Major Richard Gibbs, who last year left
his ancient medical practice at Colac to
run the McLeod Military Plospital, died ten
days ago in Melbourne as the result of a tram-
accident. The Western District thought the
world of him ; and he had every opportunity
of knowing it long before he died. Two of
his sons were with the A.1.F., and both
went west, one of them returning home only
to die of phthisis. The family had a high
sense of duty, the late Dr. Martin Gibbs, a
brother of Major Gibbs, having met his
death through postponing a necessary oper-
ation for appendicitis sooner than leave his
patients in the lurch.
The Adelaide bookselling and stationery
firm of E. S. Wigg has been celebrating its
70th birthday, and is inclined to think it is
the oldest of its kind in Australia. But
there is no Wigg in it now, and hasn’t been
for years.
A WOMAN’S CRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is joy across the way ;
Flags about the door are flying;
Lips frame out a sentence gay—
“Welcome Home!” I hear them crying.
In that wide verandah’s shade,
’Neath the Chinese lanterns burning,
War's grim terrors swiftly fade —
Someone’s soldier lad's returning!
In a cottage down the street,
Where a Cloth of Gold is clinging,
Lives a woman slim and sweet;
Often have I heard her singing
As I passed her doorway by;
Crooning to the son she cherished,
She is luckier than I,
Though her soldier-husband perished.
Far in France there is his grave,
With a little cross beside it;
There the valiant poppies wave
When their scarlet petals hide it.
Some there be whose lads come back ;
Others’ sons are soundly sleeping;
But the folk who tidings lack,
What is there to ease their weeping?
Man of mine, who sailed away,
Where you be there is no telling ;
So for me the skies are grey,
Though my scalding tears I’m quelling.
Weary, I am waiting yet,
Husband whom I would be kissing,
With a hungry heart I fret,
Knowing you are Missing—Missing !

MINCHINBURY
“Duglio”: A Yank told us this. A party
of them went over on a raiding stunt, and
as information was wanted, stress was laid
on the value of prisoners. Three of them
came back with a “bird” each. “Guess we
got ’em cheap,” said the first man in to his
lootenant —“got ’em from the Aussie guys
for five francs apiece.”

“Sam-Major”: One night a Digger,
coming out of the rear of a .quartermaster’s
store with an 801 b. bag of flour on his
shoulder, was surprised by an officer who
demanded his name, number and unit. These
were supplied without any hesitation. Then
the inquisitor asked him where he got the
bag of flour. “Strewth!” exclaimed the
Digger, slightly turning his head —“now I
wonder who put that there?”
# * * *
Reform is sighted in our Navy:—
A big step in the direction of democratising the
R.A.N. has just been taken by the Naval Board. A
committee of officers-is to be formed, to which will
be attached, in an advisory capacity, representatives
of the p.o.’s and men. Questions of accommodation
messing and canteen systems, pay, and so on will
be discussed ; and—most important of all from the
R.A.N. standpoint—the matter of promotion. This,
as The Bulletin has repeatedly pointed out since
the censorship was lifted, is the foundation of a
contented sea-service, so far as Australia is con-
cerned. The R.A.N. is satisfied, broadly speaking,
with its pay and living conditions. It has two chief
grievances. The first is that the ■ depots and the
home-service ships have been filled for years with
pensioner chief and petty officers and R.N. ratings.
The second touches the average young Australian's
faint prospect of ever becoming an officer. The boy
who joins the seaman branch has nothing like the
opportunities that the lad who goes to Jervis Bay as
a cadet midshipman is offered. The proposed com-
mittee will certainly have these questions brought
before it by the representatives of the Lower Deck
at the earliest possible opportunity. It will depend
a great deal on how such problems are handled
whether the R.A.N. of the future becomes really
Australian or is operated by R.N. officers and men
who, for whatever reason, prefer it to their own
service.
*■* * •
“Tin Hat” : July 19 needs no Peace cele-
brations to make it a well-remembered day
in hundreds of Australian homes
; —it is the anniversary of what
is known sadly to all Diggers as
“the Fleurbaix stunt.” Every
man in the division (the sth)
knew about the hop-over two
days before it came off. So did
Fritz, and his perfectly-timed
barrage and seemingly innumer-
able machine-guns sent thou-
sands of good men west before
they got across the 400 yards be-
tween the two lines. The few
Australians who were left fought
their way through to the third
German line, only to find that
they were out off and had to
fight every inch of
the way back. Was
ever an inquiry made
into that butchery?
Were the people re-
sponsible for it ever
pilloried? We have
seen in orders that
men have been pun-
ished for trifling
breaches of “discipline.” We have never
seen any reference to even a reprimand for
this cold-blooded sacrifice.

“Beer for Me”: When the Australian
wants to celebrate he shuts the pub. Pro-
hibition will seem like one long festival.
“William James Digger” : There is some-
thing to be learned from the cook who was
“crimed” for allowing fl ; es to congregate
round his cookhouse (B. 26/6/T9). On Gal-
lipoli this was almost as great an offence
as going to sleep while on sentry-go. By
either act the lives of comrades were en-
dangered. Scraps of meat, etc., thrown
about meant flies, and flies meant, disease.
Until the m.o.’s and regimental officers got
busy the pests, many of them fat green fel-
lows that had risen from the dead between
the lines, were in millions, and practised
massed attacks on the dixies at every cook-
house. Notices such as, “Bury that meat-
tin !” and “Why don’t you keep your jam
covered V” were posted in every trehcln A
company sergeant-major devised many quaint
warnings. “WHY feed the fly and KILL
the man?” was one of them. It’s worth
remembering.

A while ago there raged in Melbourne a
feud between two pushes which culminated
in one bloke shooting another bloke in Little
Collins-street, not at midnight, but at mid-

day. The wounded man was last week suf-
ficiently recovered for his assailant to be
tried for the indiscretion. The shooting
had been admitted by accused, though he
didn’t know he had fired as many as four
bullets into the other bloke’s body as well
as one into his forearm. The charges against
him were of shooting with intent to murder
and shooting with intent to do grievous bodily
harm, and concerning the harm there
was no possible doubt whatever. After a
brief retirement the jury brought in a ver-
dict of not guilty on both counts. If the
same case and the same verdict were
reported from a South American republic,
this country would be expected to thank
Heaven that it lived where Law and
Order prevails and the jury system is a
bulwark of the people’s liberties, etc.
* * * *
The Sydney police complain of an aston-
ishing outbreak of crimes of violence, and
declare that in this generation at any rate
“gunning” was never before so popular.
They have themselves to thank for it. Re-
cently a Yank from Arizona jumped into a
disturbance which the police had well in
hand and shot the demented Chinaman who
had made the trouble. Instead of telling
this flash Yank that civilians are not en-
couraged to be handy with “guns” in this
country, the papers whooped about his
courage and actually the Chief Secretary,
who controls the Police Department, paid
him £5O out of the public’s funds for his
bit of unauthorised and probably quite un-
lawful gunning. It was a case of pandering
to the vote of the push and the people with
push instincts; and the public will have 1.0
pay for it.
* * * *
“Naming”: A Sydney Sun cable says that
the American Anti-Saloon League has
launched a huge Prohibition campaign in
England, and that “snectacular methods”
are to be employed. Here is one of the
“spectacles” seen frequently in the States
last year. A man or woman—sometimes
both—of obviously genteel but battered ap-
pearance, noisily withdrew from a hotel bar
into the street in a condition of gross and
offensive drunkenness. The usual crowd soon
collected. Amidst shrieks of despair the
offender would finish up with the usual
arrest, wailing that drink had ruined home,
family and all the rest of it. Such scenes
undoubtedly effected a great revulsion of
feeling against drink among people with
moderate views on the question. What was
rarely if ever disclosed was that the
“offenders” were actors and actresses who
accepted fat fees from the League for per-
forming the unprofessional job. A police-
court appearance rarely followed, for there
was always someone ready with bail* which
was usually forfeited.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The knntial
meeting of subscribers to the Industrial
Institute for the Blind reminds me that
dawdling is an old habit in Sydney. Half
a century or so back a Glebe man thought
he would see if he couldn’t get a move on
something. So he left £5OOO to build an
Industrial Institute for the Blind, on con-
dition that the work was started within a
certain limited time. It was nearly fatal.
Somebody who should have pushed the will
through probate went fishing or something,
and at the last hour there had to be an
awful scramble. Old John Robertson cut
a slice off Phillip Park for a site only just
in the nick of time.
* * * #
The other day the quarrels of yet an-
other Parliamentarian and his missus were
given an airing in a Sydney suburban court.
The wife of a State M.L.A., who one day
attempted to destroy herself and her chil-
dren, wrote to the Sydney press a letter —
of course it was not printed—in which she
declared that before a man married he
should be made to counter his wife’s pro-
mise to obey with a vow .that he would
never enter politics. Many politicians’
wives probably agree with that sentiment.
Parliamentary messengers can tell curious
tales about the matrimonial troubles of quite
a large number of members.
THE LEISURED CLASS.
CLERK (to worried cartoonist): “By Jove,
old chap, if I could draw like you I’m
blowed if I’d work.”
It is easier to find a baby than a house
in Sydney now. Writer knows a young
bride who went to live with her mother
pending the discovery of a suitable residence.
She has two infants now and is still living
with her mother.

ANOTHER DOMESTIC TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Hopeful Sufferer.—Your husband is insensible
to the beauty you put into your home. Dainty
table appointments are wasted on him. He has no
soul above the sordid grind of business. He gnaws
bones. His manners destroy your appetite.. He is
coarsening in every fibre. What shall Vou do?
That tragedy may not be eternal, but it is very old.
The time will come, of course, when refined women
will not marry that sort of man; but the taint of
the harem lingers, and in 1919 many women find a
certain attraction in the human brute. There is no
known cure for sordid coarseness and insensibility in
a man. You may strive by your own example, by
the constant delicate mute reproach of your own
delicacy and tact and good taste; but you mustn t
expect immediate result. Such cases are very obstinate
and difficult.” — Triad, Correspondence Column.
She laid a fair, sweet woman-mind ;
Her name was Araminta Jones.
Her husband was the loathly kind
Who, during dinner, gnaws at bones;
Then, coarse in ways as in attire,
Sets an ill-smelling pipe on fire.
All know the low, revolting type:
It toils in town from nine to five,
Then hurries homeward bearing tripe,
Oy3ters (some dead and some alive),
And beer in small brown bags which tell
Their owners’ habits all too well.
Such men wear thirty-shilling shoes
And rather bashed and dusty hats:
They talk of alcohol as “booze,”
And each and all are breviats
Of knowledge about golf and bowls,
And none of them have any Souls.
Imagine Araminta’s plight!
A girl of taste and intellect,
And Most Genteel —yet every night
Her dreadful spouse would resurrect
Old puns and riddles long, long dead,,
And hurl them at her cultured head.
In desperation she embarked
Upon a scheme which all must praise.
THE IMPORTANT POINT.
NEW WED : “I always invite my husband's
old flames to dinner.”
LONG WED: “ That's all right. But don't in-
vite the new ones.”
With tactful firmness she remarked
On his uncouth and boorish ways.
Repeatedly she rallied Jones
About his trick of gnawing bones.
She talked to him of Tacitus,
And racked his dull suburban brain
By quoting from Petronius,
Mill, Browning, Spencer and Montaigne,
Until, with aspect desolate,
lie dropped his bones upon his plate.
He talked of “stoush” when she had donis,
And aired his vulgar racing views.
He quoted poems from the Sun
And leaders from the Evening News.*
She winced, then sadly, faintly smiled —
Which used to make him very wild.
One night, as she was reading him
A charming thing by Yeats —in Erse—
He rose, his visage pale and grim,
Emitted an appalling curse,
Dashed furiously through the door,
And never came back any more.
He has become an M.L.A.
In Glubbe (Bananaland) afar;
While she, from ten to six each day,
Controls a leading city bar.
Him the insensate voters cheer;
She hands out Culture mixed with beer.

BEFORE the GRADUOLA, the in-
genious patented tone controlling de-
vice in the AEOLIAN VOGALION
was invented, it was hitherto unknown
how to mechanically imitate the voice
perfectly.
The GRADUOLA achieves the seem-
ingly impossible. Like a singer’s throat,
it perfectly controls tone

Similar to the vocal chords the GRADUOLA
is elastic in nature and of great flexibility. Like
the throat it expands and contracts and can di-
minish or increase a tone slowly or rapidly and
by imperceptible degrees. The
AEOLIAN
VOCALION
is the only phonograph that can accomplish this.
Even if the VOCALION did not possess
other outstanding features, this one overwhelming
attribute alone, namely, the GRADUOLA, would
be sufficient to make your choice a VOCALION.

384 GEORGE STREET,
SYDNEY,


A Modern Philosopher, Lecturer and a Great Student writes that Clements Tonic
is certainly a Medicine for the Tired Brain.
Hi
V
Clements Tonic Ltd., Rozelle, Sydney, N.S.AV.
THE REVEREND GEORGE WALTERS has had a long and active career as a
Minister of the Unitarian Denomination, as a student of modern philosophy and
Science, and as a literary critic and dramatist
Ilis church work extends from Lancashire and Aberdeen, United Kingdom, to
Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. He is author of the dramatic works,
CLEfIENTS TONIC LTD.
Joseph of Canaan,” “Thou Fool,” and “Empire,” or the “Tragedy of Maxi-
millian in Mexico.” He has also been President of the Shakspeare Society of
New South Wales, and is an active member and vice-president of the Dickens
Fellowship.
The following letter should be read by all students and members of the Literary
Societies of New South Wales with exceptional interest:—
“ I have much pleasure in testifying that I have, at various times, derived much benefit from taking
Clements Tonic.
“ When feeling 4 run down ’ and in need of 4 winding up,’ or when suffering from brain=fag and nerve
strain, a short course of Clements Tonic has invariably brought relief and consequent re=invigoration.
44 It helps one to say (with little 4 Pippa,’ in Browning’s poem):
“‘God’s in His Heaven; all’s right with the World.’”
-“Mosman, Sydney, September, 1918.” “(Signed).
If any greater proof is required of the powers of this splendid medicine, the testi-
monies given afford it, written by those who can well afford by experience to judge of
its merits. For the general good of the public they are published, and are well worth
reading by everyone.

“Red Tape”: There’s a proposal to cele-
brate peace by putting a clock and a peal
of _ bells in the tower of the Lands Office
building, Sydney. The Digger asks for
bread and It recalls a somewhat similar
experience of the very early days. In 1795.
when the new settlement of Sydney was
very hard up, three ships were to arrive.
The citizens “learned v r ith infinite concern,”
says Collins, who was there, “that the store-
ship Young William, from being too heaivily
laden, had been compelled to return... .and,
further, that by the two ships now arrived
they had gained onlv a few barrels of meat,
a town-clock and the principal part of a
large windmill!” That was how Australia
got its first town clock.
* * * *
“Dartford”: There were some rules of
war which, though never framed by
generals, were pretty commonly followed;
and any infringement was severely punished
by the rank and file. Last May the old
Blue Brigade came out of the line at
Villers-Bretonneux for 10 days’ spell. The
Blue and Gold battalion (Jacka’s) was
camped in Allonville, the main billets being
big sheds owned by *** Hennessey. On this
battalion’s last evening in the town, after
lights out, there were two violent explosions,
and 125 men in those sheds were casualties.
This wasn’t reckoned a fair go; after lights-
out there should, by the unwritten law, have
been no such attack on billets. Three days
later we were in a stunt; and before the
word was given “Allonville” was passed
from mouth to mouth. Everybody knew
what it meant. If the Hun will compare
TOO MODEST.
“Of course, you know I paint merely for my
own amusement.”
“Nonsense! They tickle me to death, too!”
the number of prisoners taken by the injured
battalion with those brought in by others
he will also know what it meant.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” remembers: —
Ross River, Townsville, now in the public eye,
came by its name this way. At the close of 1860
the old Princess’s Theatre, Melbourne, was in the
hands of George Fawcett, who later added Rov'e
to his stage name. He had three brothers with
him —Tom, Sandford and Charles. Tom was an
actor; the other two were employed in the front of
the house. The bars were leased by William Alfred
Ross. About this time glowing accounts reached
Melbourne from Cleveland Bay (N.Q.). It was said
that the interior of the country was covered with
gold ; no mention was made of the alligators. John
Black (who had made money as a teamster in the
roaring ’fifties ahd .built thy Theatre Royal),
William Alfred Ross' and Capt. Robert Towns
(Sydney) formed an expedition to set out secretly
and explore the wonderful country,if;The Fawcett
brothers were very intimate with l Ross, and to
them he confided the secret. Charlej' Fawcett, the
youngest of the four, a very handsome fellow,
begged leave to accompany the party; and it was
so arranged. Ross sold out of the bars to Spiers
and Pond, and off - the part}’ hurried, in dread
lest some other party might get ahead. After
the usual trials of a long voyage they arrived at
their destination. They succeeded in landing at
the mouth of a river in the bay, and pitched their
tents. The country looked a wilderness. The river

or you'll have to cut out some of the gay life
or you’ll he old .before your time.”
“Very likely. But look what a time I’ll have
before I’m old!”
they named Ross, after the ex-Melbourne publican.
Out of the expedition came the Ravenswood diggings.
Ross secured some good building sites and a street
was named after Black. Ross afterwards erected
a good hotel with a small theatre- attached. The
township had come to be called Townsville. Charles
Fawcett did not’ make the fortune he started out
to gather. Some years later he was keeping an
oyster room next the theatre.

“Exile”: I have just been visiting Stan-
ford University, established and endowed by
Governor Leland Stanford at a cost of five
million pounds, made out of railways and
silver-mines. The buildings are,
of course, modern and mag-
nificent, the laboratories and
lecture-rooms properly equip-
ped. In comparison how poorly
provided is the collection of
cubby-holes known as the Mel-
bourne University for giving a
proper training to its students
in arts or- science! The late
Thomas Stanfoi'd, who made a
fortune in Melbourne out of
sewing machines, sent his whole
fortune here to be spent on his
brother’s University. Over
£250,000 of Australian money
went that way before his death,
and neai’ly another £200,000 is
being spent now. “We’re much obliged,”
said my American guide; “but, say, aren't
you people pretty soft?” I agreed that we
were.

“Copy Boy”: Victoria reckons that if it
is to give its John Hops higher pay it must
obtain more Hop for its money. Formerly
it was considered that 68in. was enough to
preserve law’n’order, but the new chief
thinks it can’t be done properly und ; 69in.
The educational test is also to be rai fd, but
whether in the direction of insistii ; upon
candidates being able to conjugate Greek
verbs or repeat the names of the K xgs of
England from Egbert to Northcliffe h s not

According to Surgeon-General “Plevna”
Ryan, this was the queerest casualty of the
war. There were some very dead Turks
lying near an Australian trench; and one
day a shell lighted on one of them and scat-
tered it over the landscape. Unluckily for
an Australian medical-officer, he had his
mouth open at the wrong moment, and a
bit of dead Jacko went in and down. He
was soon on the sick list, and eventually
had to be invalided home.
* * * *
“The Honest Burglar”: Even house-.
breakers have their hobbies. Mine was the
collecting of autographs of people I met in
gaol, and I prided myself that I had a fine
lot. But I was disillusioned. “Flash
Dave” found me out a year or so after
my retirement from the profession. He
knew of my hobby and offered to sell me a
secret for a pound,
saying he knew I
wouldn’t like to wend
my way through a
new life under false
pretences. He made
me so Curious that at
length I paid the quid,
reouesting a receipt to
add to my collection of
curios. He asked for
my book of autographs
and I handed it to
him, all the burglars,
garrotters, warders
and etceteras neatly
arranged under their
various headings. The
flash one ticked off
about a hundred ana
twenty names, among
them those of a brace
of murderers and a
hangman in which I
had taken pardonable
pride. “All those,” he
said at length, “are
forgeries,” and pro-
ceeded to explain.
“Remember when you
were in Gaol? 1
was in the kitchen and
you asked me to collect
signatures for you. T
tried a few, but they
got suspicious and
wouldn’t sign. I didn’t
want to disappoint
you, so I wrote ’em
myself. v After he’d
gone with my quid
I looked up Flash
Dave’s own immacu-
late signature and
compared it with the
one on the receipt. They were totally un-
like, and under the old one was my pencilled
memo: “Three years’ forgery.” I’d been a
rotten picker.

“De Facto”; The wattle got on to Aus-
tralia’s coat-of-arms by accident. When the
thing was devised it had a nondescript kind
of grass background for the kangaroo, the
emu, the black swan and the magpie. E. E.
Pescott happened to see it, and suggested to
Fisher, then Prime Minister, that lie might
as well put the wattle there as something
distinctively Australian ; and the design was
altered accordingly.
* * * *
“Bill o’ -Costs” tells of a delayed triumph:
If the ghost of the late John Madden, C.J. of Vic.,
can cast a spectral eye over the English Official
Law Reports for 19i$, it must rub its hands and
caress its moustache. About 16 years ago, when
the new High Court was beginning to make State
Judges sit up; a lawsuit, Marshall v. Colonial Bank,
attracted considerable attention, especially in
banking and shark circles. The plaintiffs, having
an account with the bank, were in the habit of .
leaving to a third party the sordid job of making
out cheques for signature and paying, them away,
while they merely signed them with a fine indiffer-
ence to matter's of mere detail. The third party, seeing
his opportunity, tendered them cheques with con-
venient blanks left in the words and figures, which
he himself filled in afterwards, so that “ten
pounds” became “one hundred and ten,” and so on.
The paper being perfectly good on the face of it,
the. bank paid on presentation by the forger and
debited the customers’ account. When the frauds
were discovered, the latter insisted that the bank
must bear the loss. It seemed to laymenf, and even
to the average lawyer, a brassy claim, since the
bank had not been guilty of any negligence occa-
sioning the fraud, whereas the cheque-drawers cer-
tainly had; and so Madden directed the jury, which
returned a verdict for the bank,' with costs. The
case then became the subject of three appeals, and
Costs gave three cheers. First appeal was to the Full
Court of Vic. Result: Verdict upheld, with more
costs. Second appeal was to the High Court. Re-
sult: Vic. Full Court and Madden verdict reversed,
with still more costs. Banks broke into a cold
sweat and looked with confidence to an appeal to
the Privy Council to put the presumptuous High
THE CONNOISSEUR.
CONSTANCE (to unduly familiar stranger) :
“What do you take me for?”

start.”
Court in its place; but there the luck was no better.
The appeal met four elderly gentlemen, headed by
the brilliant llalsbury, who upheld the High Court
—with more costs. Bankers groaned, but shouldered
the liability, which recurs oftener than most people
imagine. Now, however, arises the cause of the
old Chief’s ghostly joy. Practically the same ease
has come before the English Courts and found its
way to the highest tribunal of all, the House of
Lords. In this case a clerk found that the moment the
boss was hurrying off to lunch was a favorable one
for getting him to sign cheques, with vacant spaces ;
and the usual thing happened. This Court, without
much hesitation, threw the loss on the negligent
cheque-signer. As for Marshall’s case, after refer-
ring to it with an ominous “very greatest respect,’’
they gave it a disrepectful kick, adding: “It is not
binding on any English Court,” and one and all
declined to follow it. But the House of Lords'
decision is binding on our court’s, and that Privy
Council judgment and High Court ditto must, though
not expressly over-ruled, go to the legal dustbin —
this time, without costs. But poor John Madden is not
alive to enjoy it. It looks as though it would be a
graceful act for a delegation of relieved bankers to
place a bunch of violets on the much-overruled
chief’s old judicial seat.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Tiie Bulletin, reviewing
poor Oliver Hogue’s “Cameliers,” speaks of
the lack of an official correspondent “with
the Light Horse while it was doing good
work as a Camel Corps.” Queerly enough,
the Cameliers were not all Light Horsemen.
Actually some of them were infantry. The
Light Horse brigades—lst, 2nd and 3rd —
never worked as Camel Corps, though they
were infantry on the Peninsula. The
Cameliers were drawn from details which
had not been absorbed by their regiments.
The three Light Horse brigades above men-
tioned, with the M.L. mounted regiments,
formed the famous Anzac Mounted Division.
Afterwards, when the Maorilanders were
transferred to another command, the three
formed the Australian Mounted Division.
Later still, when horses became more plenti-
ful, the Camel Corps were formed into Light
Horse regiments. Hogue finished his time
in one of these, under Colonel Arthur Mills,
originally of the Ist Light Horse and sub-
sequently a Camelier. Of course, the small
man is inclined to over-rate the importance
of his own little section in battle. Still,
looking back, I cannot visualise the Turk
smashed as he was at Romani had the L.II.
not been there, nor the way made clear to
El Arish’ without the mounted arm’s vic-
tories at Maghdhaba and Rafa. Further,
Allenby himself said the other day that a
mounted charge by an Australian regiment
on the Turkish trenches at Beersheba (the
■ 4th L.H.) decided the day in our favor.
And Beersheba was the turning-point in our
fortunes after two set-backs at Gaza. All
honor to the men of France; but the open
mounted work qf Sinai and Palestine has
not had the advertising it has merited.

“Lieutenant X.” : One boiling night in Cairo
two Diggers were painting the town. About
10.30 they lurched into an oyster-joint run
by a fierce-looking little Gyppy. After
supper the boys «felt fresh enough to pull
Pharaoh’s leg, so one of them drawled:
“Allah be praised, ol’ sport, but we can’t
pay you. We’re broke—savee?” and Bill
offered to shake hands. “Dog!” snapped
the angry son of Mahomet. “You me no
pay? I take it oud in keeks!” “Right-oli,”
said Bill, turning his back on him, “fire
away —take -for iwo!"
’FLU FANTASY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Someone has placed an anvil on my head;
A heavy hammer strikes it blow on blow.
Upon a heaving ocean rocks my bed;
A shark has bitten off my little toe;
The nurse upon the bridge has clanged a bell,
And on our starboard glow the lights of II —1!
The stench of fruit floats upward from the hold,
A nigger plays a fiddle on the deck,
And from the yard-arm, looking glum and cold,
A Chinaman is hanging by the neck;
A sad wind from the shore of Sheol wails,
And Lost Souls sit a-biting of their nails.
Beneath my head someone has lit a fire;
My frozen feet are dangling in the sea.
The nigger oh the deck declines to tire,
But scrapes away “Come back to Marjorie.”
And all the time I’m striving to remember
Some lines that Kendall wrote about September.
A chart above each bed gives useful hints -
To help the nurse to steer us into H—l;
She has a most unseemly nose and squints,
And, though I’ve asked her twice, she will not tell
Me what it' was that Henry Kendall said
About September ere I went to bed.
<4 Grey winter’s gone, come back to Marjorie”—
1 ask her if ’twas thus the poet wrote?
She grabs my legs and draws them from the sea,
Then pout's a dose of brandy down my throat.
The Chinaman swings sadly in the breqze;
I've waited hours expecting him to sneeze,
I wish the noisy nig. would go below
And eat the stinking- fruit that fills, the hold 1
Now from the shore there comes a brighter glow:,
The swinging Chow appears no longer cold;
Against the wharf of Tophet bumps my bed—
Somebody here may know what Kendall said!

“Pongo” : Out Coolgardie way a couple of
hard-doers and myself were on a frizzle some distance
from the camp. We were on our uppers, and had
barely enough money to keep us in water and grub
for a week. We hadn’t had a decent wash for
months. One morning we were delighted to find
the firmament heavy with dense black clouds, and,
wonder of unexpected wonders, it began to sprinkle
rain. “Come on, lads,” I yelled, “what about a
bath? Get your togs off and we’ll stand out in
it.” Robbo, the shrewd egg, came out of the tent
with a tin of soft soap, contents of which he
liberally spread over his Impressionist carcase. Then
he stood in front of the tent —and watched the clouds
roll by ! It didn’t rain more than that first sprinkle.
Before the last black cloud had departed it started
to blow a sandstorm. We were bad enough; but

“Egdix”: I’ll back this against every-
thing to keep a pipe from burning and cracking.
Rub a few drops of olive oil well inside the bowl
and slide a drop through the stem. Allow the
pipe to stand over night; run a cleaner through,
and she’s right. Do this before the pipe has been
used—but don’t try it on a Japanese pipe.
THE PROGNOSIS.
“Tell me the worst, doctor .”
“ Certainly. Your wife’s going to get letter.”
“Barcoo” : “Werrimee,” in a recent Bul-
letin, asserted that drovers’ waggonettes are con-
traptions mostly fit only for the scrapheap. That
may be true of the cocky outfits he has struck, but
in Bananaland, the Territory and N.-W. Westralia,
where the real overlander is found, that class of
vehicle would be quite useless. With the average
cattle camp the cart in use is mostly a specially-
built waggonette, capable of carrying a couple of
tons, to which are attached five and sometimes six
first-class horses. The sheep-drover of from 12 to
16 thousand usually has a specially-constructed
spring dray, with light wheels, drawn by three
staunch, actionable draught-horses. The vehicles
have to be capable of transporting the kit of from
eight to 15 men. The kit includes a large tar-
paulin, which is pitched on arrival in camp over the
ration cart, the swags of the members of the camp
(they are usually pretty bulky), water-tank or cask
full of water, the babbler’s cooking utensils, tents,
and, as a couple of hundred miles or so may inter-
vene between the shanty-stores, a full supply of
rations. Incidentally, in the sheep-droving outfits
the rationing is, as a rule, more liberal than in
the cattle camps, and better cooks are generally
employed. The tucker for dinner (at night) is
usually soup with boiled mutton (corned), roast
mutton, sea-pie, stuffed mutton, Irish stew, meat-pie
and stewed mince. Two of these dishes are served
every evening. For breakfast there may be sausages
(made on the premises), cutlets or fried chops,
•lamb’s fry, rissoles (always), curry and rice, curried
mince and sheep’s-head stew. Two, and sometimes
three, of these dishes’ (depends on the babbler’s
liver) are served each morning. Sweets are plum-
duff and rice sago or tapioca (alternately).
* * * *
“J.G.”: Dunno about the suitability of
the native-cypress or Murray pine as a building
timber; but as a fencing timber it has no equal.
There are fence posts of the pine (called cypress
there) standing in the Northern Vic. plain country
40 and 50 years old, and they are as sound now
as the day they were put in. Box, red-gum and
ironbark posts put in at the same time have long
since decayed or been eaten by white ants. Some
people who have seen what excellent timber the
cypress pine has proved to be for fencing in the
north jumped to the conclusion that the imported
pine (Finns insignis) would be just as good for
Southern Victoria. Near where I am now living
a lot of big P. insignis was cut down less than five
years ago, sawn into Bft. lengths and used as
straining posts. Some of them were over two feet
in diameter, but of all rotten stuff they were the
limit, and were masses of decay in a couple of
years, and had all to be replaced by hardwood. I
don’t know a timber that decays faster, especially
where it gets wet pretty often.
* * * *
“Gleniris”: The trouble with horti-
cultural advisers like “Te Whare,’’ who urges
(B. 26/6/’l9) “the cultivation of the Cape goose-
berry on a large and systematic scale,” is that
their remarks are rather too general—just like
the Seed-catalogues. For instance, the Cape goose-
berry will grow in my back garden into a big
bush, loaded with plump fruit of quite remarkable
size; but the goods drop off before they are ripe.
This happened to me after I had raised a mob of
the plants in a hot frame and spent a lot of time
rearing them to full growth. Mine is a “coastal
district,” as recommended by “Te Whare,” but
evidently not the right sort.
* * * *
“Azac”: Ever seen the dingo deliver the
knock-out to the emu ? The thick feather overcoat
of the bird is very effective as a protection against
the bite of the native dog, so he proceeds as follows.
He chases the emu to a standstill and then attacks
with his claws, scratching hard at the feathers until
enough are plucked away from the spot where he
makes his fatal bite. He’s a rotten Australian is
the dingo.

“Jacob’s Ladder”: That track from
N. S. Wales into Vic. which runs from Jindabyne to
Gelantipy isn’t used a dozen times a year now, but
in the old days it was one of the main routes from
the Monaro country into Eastern Gippsland. In
the bad old days of interstate tariffs there was a
tax-collector on it, and in one year
he raked in revenue on 28,000 head
of cattle passing down into Gipps-
land. From Jindabyne the track
keeps up towards the top of Aus-
tralia for a while, then zig-zags down
2000 ft. into the Snowy River Gorge in
about two miles. After twisting about
along the river for 15 miles it climbs
out over another mountain, through
forests of pine, then drops down
another 2000 ft. into the Suggan Bog-
gin valley and crawls up nearly
3000 ft. to the top of , the Black Moun-
tain, all in less than 10 miles. From
the Black Mountain there is a long,
gentle slope down to Gelantipy and
Buchan. It never was a carriage-
road, but the old-time Monaro men
didn’t trouble about that. There are
cattle-stations in this wild country
which have never had a wheel near
them; packhorses did the carrying.
At one station down below Ingegoodye
they used to wait till there were
two youngsters to be christened, and then carry
them out, one on each side of a packhorse, to have
the job done in good order.

“11.E.P.”: “T.0.M.” (B. 3/7/’l9) asks
for a remedy for a pipe that has got too strong
to smoke. Remove the mouthpiece, fill the bowl
with methylated spirits, let it stand for 24 hours.
Empty spirits out and put it on the shelf till it gets
dry. If that won’t cure it buy a new pipe.
* * * *
“Amalekite”: This is the record for
“putting in the peg’’ that I know. In a little
township on the Victorian western plains a local
identity was one of the best customers that the
only pub in the place had. Practically all his
earnings went over the counter. One day he walked
into the lubricating establishment and called for a
long sleever. “Wait a minute, Joe,” said the beer-
hoister; “I’m serving some gentlemen in the par-
lor.” “Ain’t my money as good as theirs?” roared
the old chap—“no, 111 be blanked if I wait. I’ll
go out to the pump, and I’ll never take another
blanky drop of your or anybody else’s beer.” And
he never did.
“Jackar”: Diggings-days justice was
prompt and drastic. Tar and feathers were not in
vogue at the time of which I write, because tar was not
then available. The “slum dam’’ was the favorite
place for inflicting punishment, particularly with
the Cousin Jacks. I remember a Chinese being caught
red-handed slaying a kid which he had stolen from
a Cousin’s camp. He was dragged to a tailings
dam. Two ropes having been brought, one was
fastened under his armpits and the other around
his ankles. Then he was hurled into the “slum,”
and with a stalwart C.J. on each rope he was
tugged to and fro until he was well-nigh smothered.
"BIRDS OF A FEATHER.”
BOAT PROPRIETOR : “No, I ain't ever hard on the cloth. You and me, I says to meself , is
in the same boat —the on’y day o' the week we yot a real chance to pick up a bob
or two is Sunday.”
When he was dragged out and the ropes detached a
mighty propulsive force from a No. 13 boot sent
him about his business. The Chinese had a Com-
mittee of Morals, and barely half an hour elapsed
before the boss Chow informed the boss Cousin:
“Him Ah Kim no welly-good; we talkee him go
along Jim Clow”—and he was soon on the trudge
to Jim Crow with all his belongings. Another
Chinese was captured at night while robbing the
sluice-box. The slum dam was too mild a course
of treatment for him, as the game at which he
was surprised had become popular among the Chows.
He was lashed to a post in the ash-heap a few
feet away from the end of the boiler blow-off pipe,
but not quite in direct line with it. The ashes
were piled up at the orifice and at intervals the
blow-off was worked. The Chow was thus enveloped
in steam and ashes —and then washed down with
cold water from a hose! At daylight all the Chows
in camp were rounded up and marched to the douch-
ing-post, and the steaming process was again applied.
This was over 50 years ago, and I can still hear
the yell of “Hi-yah!” The sluice-boxes were not
interfered with for a long time after that. I have
seen the slum-dam treatment applied by Cousin
Jacks to their own countrymen and to other Euro-
peans, but in such cases it was not resorted to
except on a majority vote and after much
“argifyin’.”
* * * *
“ J.G.” : Let me whoop for two gum-trees
as the best duo for shade and beauty for the hill
country south of the Great Dividing Range. The
trees are the peppermint-gum and the bloodwood.
Beth are natives of Victoria, and two more hand-
some trees would be hard to find. The peppermint
is a narrow-leaved vegetable of semi-drooping
habits; if it is pollarded when about 15ft. high the
new growth will droop like the willow. The blood-
wood is broader-leaved, with so dense a head of
foliage, in shape like a gigantic egg, that it is
not possible for the sun to penetrate it. The timber
is claret color and should be more used for furni-
ture- and cabinet-making. So far it has been
merely given over to the firestick.
• # * *
“Machete”: A mustard-plaster on the
finger to cure toothache can be improved upon.
Let the sufferer apply the plaster on the inside of
the wrist, just above the hand, and I will guarantee
no more pain in the jaw. Rub a little oil on the
skin before clapping on the mustard to prevent
blistering. The remedy, a counter-irritant, is very
old, and can be found in many of the ancient
medical works. Another point to be remembered is
to apply the plaster on the same side as the aching-
tooth. What would be advisable in the case of
a middle front tooth I can’t say.
* * * *
“D.F.” : According to E. J. Eyre, the old-
time overlander and explorer, the roots of the
mallee-gum were meat as well as drink to black
brother. After describing how the natives got
water from the roots, Eyre says that the bark was
peeled off and roasted crisp in hot ashes. After
this it was pounded between two stones and had a
“pleasant farinaceous taste, strongly resembling
that of malt.” Eyre says he had frequently eaten
small quantities of the bark, but guessed it was
only used when other tucker was scarce.
“Murkah” : A greyhound following a cart
has a peculiar method of knocking up. When he
first begins to feel the strain he lies in the shade
till the vehicle is a quarter-mile or so ahead. He
then resurrects himself, and at nearly full speed
closes the gap and keeps going for about another
quarter-mile, when he again flops down. With mourn-
ful eyes he watches the conveyance go by and spells
till there is a gap of nearly half a mile. Wearily
upending himself he again overtakes the trap and
puts another (say) 200 yards to his credit. Re-
liable 6-knot Dobbin soon removes the advantage.
Each time the dog drops he takes a longer spell,
which, of course, means more distance to jnake up.
Also, each time he spurts he leads the conveyance
by less and less, till pretty soon he merely catches
up and collapses. Then he takes to catching up
by instalments, but soon throws this scheme up.
Then, if you want that dog any more, it is a case
of wait till he slouches up to be put in the cart.
In long drives about Riverina and Northern Victoria
I have seen every kind of dog knock up except
fox-terriers. They will chase every available rabbit
in the 'paddocks each side of the road right
home, barking like a machine-gun throughout;
they’ll fight everything that is willing, and they'll
finally finish ahead of the trap and look surprised
when you commence to unload a pack of depressed
mongs. The most easily knocked-up hound of my
acquaintance is the bulldog. He wants a good drink
every half-mile or so, and on an ordinary sunny
day 10 miles is his limit.
APPLIED MILITARY TERMS.
CIVVY: “Got it from the wife for being late
home last night, eh?”
DIGGER: “Did I! Devil of a stunt! Zero
time she starts sending in salvoes. Sur-
vived it all right until she laid down a
creeping barrage. That put the wind up
and I retired on my base.”
“Searchlight”: The scrub-leech is as
wicked a bloodsucker as the profiteer. Out on tire
Eastern Dorrigo (N.S.W.) the other day I was
struck by the erratic movement of a small grey
bird which was battering its wings on the side of
the road. The little thing was dead when I reached
it, yet at first I could not find an injury. Then T
Spotted the murderer. It was a scrub-leech, which

“Mrs. Lance Rawson”: Recently in the
Abo. pages “Jim Carew” wrote that specimens of
the now almost extinct eeratodus, or Burnet salmon,
or lung fish, were taken to England in 1898, and I
gather from his par that, with the exception of
TAKING NO CHANGES.
"How dare yon come here like that? Go away at once!”
"By Gripe, Missus, I only been take it trousis off ’cause mine tink it that pfeller dog
tear ’em.”
some ova sent to the Cold Country in 1892 and
hatched, these were the first to leave Australia,
that is wrong. In 1877 a German naturalist and his
wife, Dr. and Mrs. Grutt, stayed at Kirkcubbin Sugar
1 lantation ( Q.) with our family. They were here
to get specimens of and to study the ceratodus and
platypus. They sent a number of eeratodi to muse-
ums in Germany and England. Dr. Grutt told me
that he received £lO for each ceratodus that reached
the museums in good condition. Both these strangers
\v ere ■ past-masters in the art of preserving and pre-
paiing specimens. Besides sending the fish away in
tins,. numbei'3 were skinned, dissected and preserved;
every bone was numbered and a description written
of each specimen. Platypi were treated exactly
m the same way. The doctor was very disappointed
at not being able to get a platypus egg. He said
one day when he had dissected several females: “I
have not yet got me the egg, but—well, I have
gotten the place where the egg should be”—mean-
ing, no doubt, that he had found the oviduct. “Jim
Carew”' is wrong, too, about the size (6ft., he says)
the eeratodi grow to. I don't believe they ever reach
more than 3ft. 6in., and I have seen dozens caught
by the Kanakas and blacks in Tinnana Creek, the
Mary River and the Burnet. The Grutts came
again to Queensland in 1881. Then they were after
our gums, barks, trees, etc., and. always birds.
Mrs. Grutt skinned and preserved 109 specimens
in the weeks they were at Wide Bay. She had her
own special rifle, and used just one or two pellets
to Shoot a bird. I saw her one morning kill an
oyster-bird with a pearl bead from her shoe.

Taipo ’: Henare was talking to the taxi-
driver who had just remarked that influenza was
a rotten thing. “Yes,” said the Maori, looking
very wise; “but te epidemic he plurry sight worse.”

“Mttnga Munga”: The north-western por-
tion of the Sudan, away from the Nile, is a
sterile, waterless country, except in the brief rainy
season, but it possesses a wonderful water-storage tree
called the tebeldi. The trunk resembles that of a
Moretorr Bay fig, while the branches are like those
of the Australian bottle-tree. These tebeldi trees
retain, after the wet season, an average of 340
gallons each, and the native owners are absolutely
dependent on them for water during the dry
season. Cattle-and sheep are watered only once
in every _ two or three days, with a limited allow-
ance of six gallons for Strawberry and three for the
bleaters. Both cattle and sheep are inured to
thirst from bi rt,Ti and are possessed of abnormally
long legs, which combination enables them to travel
over tremendous distances without water. The cattle
mortality from disease is fearfully high, while wool
and beef are of such inferior quality that the only
export beyond Egypt is in sheepskins and hides.
“S. Davies”: Olci Jim and his boss, Joe
Thompson, were falling scrub up north, and had
just finished a quarrel as ...to how the job should be
started. 'Although Jim was in the right, the. boss,
as usual, had his way. Thompson started dh a
tall tree with a large fern growing on top of it, and
warned his offsider to tell him if the decoration
showed any sign of falling. After a while, down
came the fern wallop on Thompson’s cranium, knock-
ing him to the ground half senseless. “Why in hell
didn’t you tell me it was going to fall ?” gasped
the boss. “Well,” drawled Jim, “to tell yer the
flamin’ truth, I thought it would knock some blanky
sense into yer head!”

“Garrajung”; Jim, with over four years’
service, three lots of wounds and 27 months a
prisoner of war, was enjoying a well-earned rest
at the home of the best girl. A fishing jaunt had
been decided on, and, as usual on such excursions,
mighty were the preparations. Two of the girls
were busily employed cutting and packing cribs,
while Jim’s choice had been induced to hie forth
to the garden and dig worms for bait. The giddy
young things were demanding payment for various
duties performed. “Sixpence, please,” says the
youngest, after sorting out a weird collection of
knots from Jim’s fishing-tackle. “Sixpence, please,”
says the other, “for filling your pipe and rolling
your puttees.” Jim smilingly complied, when a
soft, coaxing voice broke in: “And what are you
going to give me for the worms, Jim?” Like a
flash, Jim, with a world of tenderness in his voice,
replied, “Bluestone! ”

“Petramos” : This is the story of Horace.
He was the keenest constable Glue Creek had ever
known when he first went there, a stranger to all.
He half-ruined Casey, of the Bridge Arms, by
completely abolishing the Irishman’s vast Sunday
trade. Then, in a moment of weakness, he married
Kate Hourigan, the widow of Casey’s oldest friend,
arid the town breathed again. But Horace con-
tinued to be a terror to Glue Creek, though he was
no terror to his wife, but rather a cringing futility
camouflaged by the helmet of authority. The P.C.
at this period spent most of his time out of doors
making a storm-centre of himself in defence of
liis dignity. His wife, however, sternly forbade
him to interfere with her old friend Casey and his
thriving industry, and for a while he obeyed her,
with the result that thirsty residents filled the
Bridge Arms every Sabbath. Leaving home, de-
jectedly, one Sunday afternoon, Horace roamed the
deserted streets seeking whom he might arrest.
His wrath arose as he stood under Casey’s pub
verandah and heard the murmur of beer-stained
voices, every hiccup coming to him as a challenge
and an insult. He remembered that his wife was
at home with his son and heir, and future Inspector-
General, and with a firm tread he entered the hotel
and strode among the roysterers. “Casey,” he said
to the aghast landlord, “you’ll be summoned in
the morning. And now, gentlemen, your names.”
He drew forth paper and pencil and wrote all down
carefully. “We’ll see,” he said, “who’re in the
parlors.” He strode inside, and at the first try
unearthed his wife and Casey’s missus. The lis”c
fell from his hand. Kate picked it up. “What
have we here?” she asked. “’Tis the names of
the folk in the big parlor,” cried Casey; “y’r
husband’s arrested the whole town.” Mrs. Horace
put down her glass and stood up. “Constable,”
she said, look at this list and repate these words
afther me: ‘I niver wrote it.’” He obeyed. “Now,”
she ordered, “follow me.” They went into tlrn
big parlor among the stunned revellers. “This,”
she said, touching one, “is George Jinkins. Look
well at him. He is out f’r a walk along the crick.
And this,” indicating another, “is Toby Davis, who
is at home takin’ his bicycle to pieces. And here
is Mike Muldoon. Do ye note he is drivin’ his
ould mother to visit her married daughter.” And
so she provided alibis for all. When the man
nearest the door was reached she pointed to the
publican. “Look at poor Casey,” she said,
“shleepin’ like ,an innocint child in his upshtairs
bedroom, takin' his haird-earned rest.” She tore
the list into fragments and turned fiercely on the
constable. “Go home, you dreamer,” she said,
pointing to the door. “Co home and put v’r little
baby to bed.”

Lddysou : Joynt had bought tlie milling
rights over Doyle’s 300 acres, second-class land, at

a state of perpetual torment because of what he

roots for a couple of hours or longer, and take a

With a wide, unhurried flow
Quiet clouds are sailing over,
And through dust-haze drifting slow
Mobs of travelling cattle go
Stringing out before the drover.
Song of rippling water steals
Through the wattles on the ridge,
Till like muffled thunder-peals
Comes the echoing of wheels
Rolling- on the low, white bridge.
Someone in an old spring cart
Jogging homeward from the station,
Elbows propped on knees apart,
Shoulders rounded, in the heart
Of an endless meditation.
Horsemen pass in twos and threes,
Stockwhips coiled at saddle bows;
Parrots chatter through the trees.
Leaves a-rustle in the breeze
Murmur to it as it flows.
Breathes a peace no hoof or wheel
Can disturb ; they pass, just seeming
AY ith their stir of human zeal,
Things the space can scarcely feel,
Shadows in the long day’s dreaming.

the same simple manner. As the process
costs nothing and can do no possible harm,
it seems to be at least as well worth trying
as anything else suggested. Dr. Macdonald

made a tremendous discovery.
A Satchel of Books
Aristophanes and the War Party, by Gilbert Murray,
is an interesting scrap of literature in which the
author draws a parallel between the Peloponnesian
War and the recent annoyance. He holds that the
sea-power of Athens and the land-power of Sparta
represented Britain and Germany, and that victory
went to the land-power because no big - unexpected
ally like the U.S. joined the sea-power just when
midnight was about to strike. Otherwise he thinks
the two stories would have been the same. There
is, of course, a leakage in the resemblance, for
Athens had the same drawback as Phoenecia, Carth-
age, Byzantium, Portugal, Spain, Holland, Venice—
they were all sea-bosses with a land frontier to
defend, so they had to be supreme on two
elements to keep their status. In six of the seven
cases infantry took the fleet in the rear and knocked
it out —in fact, the frozen-in fleet of Holland was
even attacked by cavalry on the ice, which was the
last straw. Britain, until airships and Big Berthas
were invented, was the one mistress of the sea who
could only be attacked on her own element andi
in a defensive sense could stick to her job. The
Peloponnesian War, in Gilbert Murray’s view, left
Athens dead and Sparta dying, and he implies that
Britain and Germany might have been similar but
for the unexpected Power that chipped in. The
theory isn’t convincing. Both Athens and Sparta
might have recovered only that the big outsider
(Macedon, not the United States) chipped in and
finished them both. Big outsiders are a variable
quantity and there is still time for developments.
Murray’s book is ostensibly about Aristophanes, and
he deals agreeably with that old playwright as a
side-line. (George Allen and Unwin, London.)
Bartholomew’s Touring Hap of Maoriland is one
of the most complete The Bulletin has seen. On
a sheet measuring 30in. x 22in. there is presented a
clear view of the orography and topography of the
three islands, as well as a chart of the principal
steamer routes in the South Pacific. The latest
railway extensions are shown, and the map is colored
to indicate the height of land. Inset are maps of
the principal towns and harbors. The publishers
(at the Geographical Institute, Edinburgh) claim
that this is the first orographical map of M.L., none
such being published by the local Survey Dept.
The Anzac Memorial, published for the benefit of
the U.S.A. of N. S. Wales, has more than a senti-
mental value. It repeats lan Hamilton’s despatches,
althoisgh they don’t make things as clear as Austra-
lians (to sav nothing of Wells’s Mr. Britling) would
like. With the beautifully-bound book is a map of
the scene of the disasters and the glories—an addi-
tional inducement to help a good cause.
The Inky Way
The eucalypt family is to have a good run
when Russell Grimwade, president of the
Vic. Forest League, brings out a book on
which he has been working for a long time.
He has the finest collection ever made of
photographs of species from Cape York to
South Cape and from Smoky Cape to the
Leeuwin, and the book ought to be some-
thing special in the way of illustrations.

The book “Historic Trentham” which was
published by Colonel Potter, Commandant of
Trentham Camp during the war, has proved
one of M.L.’s best sellers, 1.3,000 copies hav-
ing been exchanged for dollars. The original
idea was just to record the daily life in
Trentham ; but when profits began to come
in, they had to be put somewhere. Neither
AN ill Lawson (the .writer of the book) nor
the Commandant wanted to pocket them, so
a fund to provide for the education of
children of fallen soldiers was started. About
£lOOO was the nucleus made by the sales of
the book. To this has been added an army
of figures which can form fours several
times; and the sale of the book goes on
steadily.
After more than 400 days’ service, during
which it went to press 13 times, The Bul-
letin’s bright khaki contemporary, Aussie,
has been demobilised. A complete set is to
be preserved in the Commonwealth War
Museum, so that future generations will
have evidence of how Billjim laughed in
danger’s face and “pulled the leg” of Death.
In a valedictory message “Birdy” mentions
that the magazine, “like the members of the
A.1.F.,” did its bit and can be given an
exemplary discharge.
“Guilabong”: Apropos the recent high-
priced sales of Hilder’s water-colors, in
contradistinction to the few guineas the
painter received for them, “Narrung” (B.
3/7/T9) fires the right ammunition at the
wrong target. The responsibility for cases
like Hilder’s rests, not with those who buy
Australian pictures, but with those who can
afford to and won’t. It’s a depressing fact
that the average well-off Australian has no
appreciation for art, and least of all for
Australian art. A. J. Daplyn. one-time
secretary of the Royal Art Society, in a
booklet published in Sydney a few years
ago, “Landscape Painting from Nature in
Australia,” declared that the Australian of
means sits in a chair worth 20 guineas
gazing admiringly at a garish oleograph
worth half-a-guinea.
“Gleniris”: I note (B. 10/7/’l9) that
Spurgeon, director of the British publishing
firm of Cassell’s, has been given an appro-
batory dinner by the joyous shareholders of
that prosperous co. I hope their turtle dis-
agreed with them. The only good 1 ever
got out of them was seven guineas,
and they took 9000 words out of my type-
writer in exchange for the cheque. Nowa-
days I keep my goods, such as they are. in
Australia, and am able to buy myself a ban-
quet when I want one.
Ted Colles, whose political cartoons had
begun to be a feature of - The Bulletin
before he went off to the war, has been tak-
ing a course at an art school in London ; and
another young khakied Australian, Vivian
Brodsky (whose father was also the parent
ot Melbourne Table Talk), is improving
the foggy hour in the Cold Country with six
months non-military employment on a color
magazine.
: ,The Pi'ess was a power to reckon
with long before Northcliffe got interested in
iIMES or Newnes published Tit-Bits
Ihere was ; for instance, the case of the brig
Cyprus, seized by convicts in 1829 at Recher-
che Bay while on the way to Macquarie
Harbor, through “Hell’s Gates.” When they
ran up against the Sydney vessel Elizabeth
and Mary at Port Underwood (M.L.) they
had already repainted the Cyprus and gave
her out as the Friends of Boston, a Yankee
brig bound from Manila to Peru. However
one of the crew of the Elizabeth noticed that
some fish-hooks which he got from the Cyprus
were wrapped in a bit of a Hobart Town
newspaper, and that gave the show away.
Swallow (the leader) and his crowd got as
tar as Canton ; but there they were nabbed

.. J HE Bulletin gives greeting to another
little brother— lmshi, a souvenir of the
voyage of _ the trooper Karoa. The small
volume, printed in Australia (it was typed
on the ship), echoes the voice of all Diggers
—home for us! And when you come to
think of it, despite the pommies who are
running strikes Australia isn’t too bad.
Hamer puts it in the first' issue of Imsiii :
But we have learned from other scenes
How sweet is home—and all it means.
The _ Bulletin’s copy goes to the Sydney
Municipal Library, for C. 11. Bertie is
making a collection too.
/ T^ e . Question for prudent editors is—when
.(and if) Edmund de Valera vists Australia,
is he to be called the “President” of the Irish
Bepubhc” or the President of the Irish Re-
public . It is all a mater of capsized
commas.
“Kaylee”: In his young editorial days at
Condobolin T. M. Shakespeare, of the
Gountry Press Association, had more writs
than years. One aggrieved gentleman of
last wealth, observing that his enemy
seemed to flourish on libel suits, offered to
fight him to gain satisfaction. Shakespeare
agieed, and half the population turned out
to see the battle in the moonlight. The
other fellow eventually agreed that Shakes-
peare was probably right.
The feat of putting on the stage a press-
man that isn t a caricature has been accom-
plished by a new writer, Harry Wall, who
won a £lOO prize offered by Grossmith and
Launllard with “Ruts.” It is a repertorv
play of the rather drab North Country
style, and did not have much success when
pioduced. But a minor character, played
by Reginald Dance, was (says the London
Referee critic) “the first journalist I have
seen on the stage for years who has betrayed
any sign of knowledge, either in playwright
or actor, of my profession. He contributed
a really fine satire on the Manchester
Guardian method.”
The Pan-German agitator Count Hoens-
broech s summing-up in his new book. “The
Abdication and Flight of William II.”:
Superficial, frivolous, faux bonhomme, vain, auto-
cratic, a lover of pomp, proud of his money, void of
seriousness, wholly devoted to externals, a despiser
of men, friendless, resentful, a petty worshipper of
his own petty self, without one trait of greatness* a
poseur, an actor, and, worst of all for a ruler’ a
coward- into the bargain, without personal courage
—that is IViliam 11. b
Evidently Hoensbroech doesn’t like actors.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Ziz-Zac”: This is the Australian skin-
hunter’s harvest time. The Yanks have run
the price of ’possum-skins long past any
previous record. One shooter in South Bur-
nett (Q.) has made £lOOO to date, with
half the season to run. Two schoolboys got
away with their father’s gun the other
night, sauntered out, and brought home skins
worth £4 7s. 6d.

“Plain Bill” ; Any ancient Sydney folk re-
member the little sentry-box which did duty
as a toll-bar near the south end of the Deaf
and Dumb Institute on the Newtown-road?
In those days vehicles paid so much per
wheel before they were allowed to pass, On
one occasion the toll-bar suddenly amassed a
small fortune by a remarkable influx of con-
veyances loaded with eager passengers. The
responsible party was Jimmy Richards,
owner of the waggonettes and licensee of the
old White Horse Plotel on the Cook’s Itiver-
road. One afternoon Richards and two
friends were strolling about the paddock at
the back of the pub when one of the trio
spotted a small nugget. Then the two others
saw gold. The news was not suppressed, and
the rush from Sydney began. Up went the
fares on .Timmy’s vehicles 150 to 200 per
cent. Shakedowns appeared everywhere.
Even the stables were occupied by city pro-
spectors. For about a month cash flowed in.
Then the supply of fools gave out. But
Jimmy had sold while the going was good.
“H.P.”: “U.P.” (B. 26/6/Y9) is wrong
when he asserts that Adelaide has the largest
motor-body factory in Australia —Holden and
I rost’s. The motor-body works of Tarrant
Motors Pty. Ltd., Melbourne, are bigger. The
factory occupies more than 100,000 square
feet, and gives employment to over .250 men.
No other bodyworks in Australia employ any-
thing like that number.
*.* * *
, "'Glenms'’ : The potato-thieves mentioned
by Polstan” (B. 26/6/’l9) as having
cleaned out a farmer’s paddock and re-
placed the green tips, which presently
wilted, did a clumsy job. An up-to-date
spud-robber would have known that it is
possible to remove half the tubers from be-
neath the potato-plant when it is well
grown, restore the earth, and still presently
harvest an excellent crop of potatoes—
nearly as great, if conditions are favor-
able, as would have been garnered if the
plants had remained untouched. This sounds
almost too good to be true, of course; but
the farmer of whom “Polstan” wrote might
try the scheme on a few rods of his next
crop, and see if he can’t overtake his losses.
* * * *
“Homo”: “Country Ped” (B. 5/6/’l9) is
too pessimistic about the penny rulers and
set-squares used in elementary' Vic. schools
for instrumental drawing. Apparently his
school only once got the good Australian
article, and then had Jap rubbish forced
upon it. But the Australian rulers and
squares are still being made. For the past
years Smith Bros., of Ivew (Vic.) have
been turning out the goods at an ever-
increasing rate. But, notwithstanding re-
peated representations, a wretched 5 per
cent, tariff wall is the highest barrier they
can get raised against the rough and badly-
gauged things which Nippon shovels over
*
Hobart shipyards got a good advertise-
ment the other day when the locally-built
mosquito steamer Maweena, built to run up
the river to New Norfolk, cut out the 477
miles from Melbourne to Hobart in 46 hours,
in spite of a heavy cargo and bad weather,
incidentally she and the Dart, which blew
m the same day, brought the first mainland
mails to reach the Speck for 13 days.

“Homan Dry”: We are waking up slowly,
lor years our meat cos. have sent their
extract to Europe in chunks at about 6s.
per lb. There it was thinned down with
water, put into a fancy bottle under a fancy
name, and ferried across 12,000 miles more
water back home. We paid 2s. for a couple
ot ounces of our own beef juice, and thought
we were lucky. Now we add our own water
put it under our own labels, and keep the
money in the family ; and analysis finds that
the local extracts contain from 5 to 12 p.c
less water than their peregrinating brothers’
with a corresponding extra quantity of
gravy.^
“Exile” (from U.S.A.) : The rush to
imirope ot Europeans of the working class
has assumed serious proportions. Literally
thousands of foreigners are leaving the
Lmted States daily, for Italy, Greece and
Scandinavia chiefly, taking with them, it is
stated officially, an average sum of £6OO.
while some Greeks and Italians carry as
much as £looo to £3OOO. Three reasons are
given for ieaving America: (1) Prohibition
of liquor; (2) homesickness; (3) better
?T7? nceS now Europe of making money.
Whatever the real reason of the exodus, it is
a serious thing for the United States, and
will cause a shortage of menial labor.
* * * *
Azac”: While meat is so dear, why not
turn to dugong (sea-cow)? The bacon is
excellent—about even with the best of the
hog s. The beast is in thousands in the Gulf
ot Carpentaria. Years ago A. C. Franklin,
owner, ruler, prime minister, etc., of Sweer’s
Island, in the centre of the gulf, offered free
sites for curing-houses to anyone who wished
to tackle the industry. But the job must
.have .been considered too far. from home;
besides, a mutton-chop didn’t cost a bob, then.
PICK-ME-UP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Buck up, old son! Don't give it best,
Though life should seem all toil and sorrow ;
For all of us there’s joy and rest—
Perhaps the luck will turn to-morrow.
Fight on! Hope on! A merry heart
Keeps off the cares like dingoes slinking;
Strike camp and make another start
While overhead the stars are winking.
There’s joy in marching. Fling behind
The weary stage that you are hating,
And ere you’ve walked an hour you’ll find
Good Fortune on a milestone waiting.

First of all, it’s a REAL Raincoat, that will
keep you dry and comfortable in a downpour.
But it doesn’t appear a Raincoat, because it
has the fabric look.
Between the outer fabric and inner lining there’s
a film of rubber which makes this coat
thoroughly waterproof. Seams are cemented,
sewn and overlaid with tape.
The wearer of this coat will never experience
any “stuffy” feeling. It’s as free in ventilation
as tweed, and as waterproof as rubber. Smart

Wrinkles, and How to Remove them.-— Worry,
late hours or the passing of old Father Time
mav cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s face; but the cure is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin leod, which,
while nourishing the fatty tissues, will not
coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon the
face, as so many inferior creams do. lo
remove the wrinkles, bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it dry, then, while it is still
warm! smear a little mercolized wax over the
whole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the fingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any supeifluous
wax, leaving a little on the skin all night.
In the morning wash off with warm watel
and Pilenta soap. The use of the wax not
onlv feeds the skin, but removes the dead
outer cuticle, giving the fresh young skia
beneath an opportunity to breathe and show
itself.
Beautiful Hair—How to Shampoo.— Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once. in
every two or three weeks. Before, shampooing,
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules in a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual nay.
Kinse and dry by fanning with a palm fan, or
in the open air, if the weather permits. Should
the hair be naturally very greasy, the oil
massage should be omitted, fetallax can be
bought at any chemist’s in quarter-pound
sealed packages; it keeps and one
package contains sufficient for 2o or ou
shampoos.
A Greasy Skin and Blackheads. —Blackheads
are absolutely fatal to beauty, for they give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos-
metics can ever hide. The way to ren jJ°
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years those
who suffered in this way were restricted in
their diet, denied sweets and had to suffer
other privations. Modern science has, how,
ever, provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one stymol tablet in a
glass of hot water, and when the effervescence
has subsided, dip a small, soft sponge into the
liquid and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin bathe
the face three times a week with stymol ana
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Improve the Eyebrows and Eyelashes.—
Long, curling eyelashes make the most in-
different eyes look attractive, and while no
one can alter the color, shape or size of tne
eves, all may possess luxuriant eyelashes ana
well-shaped eyebrows. To increase the growth
of the eyelashes rub a little, m™ ll '' "
the roots very gently every night. Mennaune
is a perfectly harmless and delicate pomade
like substance which may he obtained at an.
chemist’s. For the eyebrows smear a little oi
the mennaline on a small soft brush, and

! arched direction, according to how you.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CAIRO.—No, I am not surprised at hearing
from a reader so far away, as 1 get letters
from everv part of the world. I expect it is
the heat that 1 has caused you to put on weight
so rapidlv. and can quite understand how
much it adds to your age. Get a small quan-
tity of clvnol berries and eat one alter each
meal They will permanently reduce your
weight, are quite harmless, and you need
make no alteration in your diet.
QUEEN BESS— Thirty is far too young to
have grey hairs, and you must not allow the
trouble to increase. Get two ounces of tamma-
lite. mix it with three ounces of bay rum, and
apoly to the hair with a small, soft sponge.
This will restore the grey and fading hair to
its original color.
EMMELINE. —For your muddy looking skin
get a tin of mercolised wax and rub a little
well into the face and neck every night. Leave
on till morning, then wash off, using PUenta
soap and warm water. This will remove the

JESSIE.—To remove the hairs from the hP
and chin get an ounce of powdered pbemino
and use as directed Then apply tekko paste
several times daily for some weeks. This com
bined treatment will permanently remove an
trace of hair from your face.
FRECKLED LASS.—To prevent the freckly

ounce of cleminite and mix it with four o ° u “ „ r
of warm water, allow to cool, then dab over
the face This will not only protect the ski

dainty fresh look far superior to the bloom

“Fax”: Seems to me that the combined
brewers are the truest Friends of Temper-
ancT“fter all. When the first lager was
brewed in Melbourne it was sold in shops
at ss. 6d. a dozen. To-day the same brand
is 10s., and mine is water, please.
There was no sense in looking for the
owner of one lot of money that was found
bv Aussies in France. A party diggmg-in
near the site of ah old Roman camp on the
Somme turned up over 40 coins with the
heads of Nero and other emperors of the
Ist century a.d. on them. .P 1
iim Cincinnatus had planted them there
after cleaning out the two-up school; and
Billjim Parramatta reckoned the silly
blighter had gone to the estaminet then and
forgotten all about it.
The Melbourne Mint was established in
1872, and, according to latest returns,
37 300,1200 z. gold has been received, and
gold coins have been turned out to the value
of £146,628.219. Of the gold 27,588, nooz.
was raised in Vic., and the rest came from
Maoriland and Westralia. Of sovereigns
134 813,500 and of half-sovs. 1,593,5.>9
have been struck off. The Mint commenced
coining silver in 1916, when Governor Man-
lev struck the first piece—on January 10
and since then 31,484,806 (joins have been
put into circulation, with a currency value
of £1,842,150. ' ,
“Willie Woodbine” : Of course the Yanks
have found in their own lines the “bravest
man of the war.” It’s all rubbish! Nobody
will ever know who was the bravest man
of the war. Probably he was killed before
lie did a thing. A “hero” must have luck
(1) in getting an opportunity to display his
heroism, and (2) in remaining alive long
enough to seize the opportunity. Think ot
the men who were killed in the Landing.
Who can tell what_ heroes were amongst
their number? The Yank may be the
bravest man of the war; but it s about a
million to one that he isn’t.
“Devilfish”: Australia has done its bit of
sea-raiding, too: the Sea Adler and the
Wolf were by no means the first ships that
went privateering in the Pacific. There was,
notably, the Cornwallis, commanded by Cap-
tain Charles Johnston, a cousin of > the
nominal leader of the “Rum Rebellion,
which left for a cruise on the Spanish Main
on April 23, 1807. In October Thomas
Graham and a prize crew brought in the
Pegasus, which had been captured on the
coast of Peru, and informed Governor Bligh
that when they left the Cornwallis on August
2 she had already captured 14 Spanish
vessels.
“Briar P”: This is how the grant to
N.S.W. municipalities for the employment
of returned soldiers is to be spent in our
district. A main road carrying heavy traffic
from an agricultural district is in need or
repair j but as the Council has to find all
the necessary material used in this repatria-
tion scheme it cannot afford to have the work
done. So the men are to be employed
shovelling dirt about on an unmetalled side
road which is used by less than half a dozen
ratepayers and as a cattle camp before sale
days. The first heavy rain will wash the
earth back to -where it was before the money
was wasted.
“Dea”: Centuries ago the Magyars had
got the measure of the Germans, and had
expressed it in the following then popular
song:—•
Magyars, trust not the Germans,
No matter how or what they protest;
Naught is the parchment they give thee.
Though it be as large as thy round cloak,
And though they set a seal on it
As big as the brim of the moon;
Spite of all, it lacks all virtus.
Confound them, Jesus Christus!
When I was in Hungary in 1905 everything
German was anathema. The German names
of the streets had been taken down and
questions addressed in German to conductors
of trams, etc., though understood, remained
unanswered. No wonder Hungary cut
adrift as soon as the opportunity offered!
“W L” • The lonely Tarndale-road
through Wairau Gorge in Marlborough, the
most lofty inhabitated country in Maori-
land, holds a record for condensed human
tragedy. At one place a station-manager m
years gone by fell in love with a girl who
lived miles away. He sent a letter to her
by the hand of a German named Charlie.
The Hun could not read. But he had the
letter read aloud at every pub and station
that he passed; and the names of the man
and the girl became bywords. The lover re-
signed his post and set his affairs in order.
Then he rode over to German Charlie’s hut
and presented a revolver at him. “Here’s
another letter for you, Charlie,” he said, and
shot the man dead. After which _he rode
eight miles, hung his saddle and bridle on a
tree and shot himself.
“X 49”: “Baton’s” summing-up of the late
Edmund Fosbery, erstwhile Inspector-
General of Police in N.S.W. (B. 10/7/T9),
is certainly not endorsed by many of his col-
leagues of the Fosbery period. Fosbery pos-
sessed far greater commonsense and adminis-
trative capacity than any of his successors.
He was a strict disciplinarian, and had no
time for the leadswinger or casefaker; but
the man who was in trouble or deserving
of recognition could always rely upon getting
a fair deal. Moreover, he was a gentleman,
and consequently incapable of the mean,
petty acts that have characterised so many
pf the professional John Hops. His oppo-
sition to a number of changes, since adopted
by the Department, was controlled entirely
by circumstances. In some instances the
time was unfavorable or the political pres-
sure too great to permit him to endorse
their adoption; whilst in others, he was
unable to reconcile the introduction of demo-
cratic innovations with the strict discipline
then considered necessary to preserve the
efficiency of this semi-military body. Now,
however, democracy has become a habit in
the service; but it has yet to be proved
that the fundamental principles of the
service have not been impaired by the grant-
ing of some of the concessions which are now-
being held up as examples of perfect adminis-
tration. Fosbery was not exactly beloved
by his men; but he was admired and
respected always for his strength of
character and his straightforward and im-
partial judgments.

Goodyear Transmission Belts
Product
Goodyear Transmission Belts have
completely exploded the old belief
that extraordinary tension is the only
way in which a belt can get an
adequate pulley grip. And by the
abolition of this false notion Goodyear
Belts have greatly benefited users,
for extreme tension shortens the life
of belting.
Belts constructed on the theory that
the belting material must be either
perforated or dressed in order to grip
pulleys have yielded place to the
Goodyear System. Goodyear Belts
need no dressing and hug the pulleys
without being “stretched on”.
Goodyears have a friction surface
which masters the air-film evil and
have a maximum pulley contact
because of their superior pliability.
They grip the pulleys and save
power and in consequence give a
much longer and a much better
service.
Service
Two factors contribute to secure
maximum service for users of Good-
year Belting and other Mechanical
Goods. There is the intrinsic merit
of all such products as bear the
Goodyear brand and name, to which
is added the knowledge proven by
experience of what type of equipment
will meet each particular call for
service.
The Goodyear Technical Man is at
your call for just this service. His
specialised knowledge and continuous
experience of results will assist you to
secure not only the maximum service
in belts, and consequent economies of
factory operation, but will ensure the
effective transmission of power with
its accompaniment of maximum out-
put of machines or plant.
Our specification of Goodyear Belting
carries with it the acceptance of re-
sponsibility for its satisfactory service
and wear.
Stocks of Goodyear Mechanical Rubber Goods are now carried throughout Australia by

“P.A.”: Add to the roll of young Aus-
tralian Generals E. A. Drake-Buckman, who
was only 34 when he got his crossed swords.
Bar silver touched 4s. sd. in New York
recently, and the United States mint is
busy melting down the vast mass of silver
dollars stored for 40 years in the vaults.
It is a fine chance to make big profits by
selling bar silver, chiefly to Britain on
account of India, where the demand is in-
satiable and no check on hoarding by the
natives has yet been applied.
When Diver Frank Hughes went out to
’flu in Brisbane a haixl battle against rheu-
matism ended. The Muckadilla bore waters
were tried, but vainly; and towards the end
the brave old chap, feeling that the burden
of home-nursing was too great, went per-
manently into hospital. “If all my medals
represented only £5O a year, I would be much
happier now,” he said a few days before his
death.
The surprising King O’Malley, getting
back to his old haunts in S. Aus. to look
for a Labor nomination, tells an interviewer
that -he would have returned to his real
home in U.S.A. soon after he first landed
here had not Gregor McGregor said to him,
“Ah, man, don’t be a fool! There are
millions of King O’Malleys in America, but
only one here.” Which, if true, was probably
the only unkind thing McGregor ever did to
Australia.
Colonel Bettington, of the R.A.F., who is
reporting on the best places to have aero-
dromes and landings for aircraft in Maori-
land, is not at all what the flappers ex-
pected a birdman to be. He is heavily built
all through, with a monocle and a sweet
smile to brighten the picture, and he just
travels in a motor-car with a civilian chauf-
feur. Joe Ward has impressed on him that
an air service across the Tasman is one of
the things he is going to introduce very
soon.
Sydney’s first beer was brewed in 1796
from maize “properly malted,” says David
Collins, who may have sampled it, “and
bittered with the leaves and stalks of the
love-apple, or Cape gooseberry.” The brew
was found so good that “a building proper
for the business was erected by an individual
at a considerable expense.” The liquor was
sold at Is. 6d. a bottle. At the same time
rum was ss. a bottle and Cape wine 3s. As
tea cost 245. a lb., even Archdeacon Boyce
might find it in his heart to forgive them
that turned to malt.
“Bally Who”: I heard cats sing in vaude-
ville at Dover (Eng.). Two unfortunates
were strapped in upright positions, with tiny
pieces of music before them for the sake of
effect. A performer then intimated that the
animals would join in the chorus of his song.
When the chorus was reached an electric
current was switched through the stands to
which the cats were attached, and the shock
the Sisters Puss received produced an opera
of roof-top excellence. It really didn’t hurt
the cats, but it caused them no end of an-
noyance, and a wideawake S.P.C.A. stopped
the show.
McCawley, President of Bananaland Arbi-
tration Court, whose appointment 18
months ago caused an explosion, lately told
the A.W.U. that preference to unionists
would be a fine thing if it were supported
by an undertaking on the part of the union
to carry out the work, but that “while even
a minority of the workers preached a nega-
tion of the principle of a fair day’s work for
a fair day’s pay, preference might be made an
instrument of oppression.” The people who
exploded are now wondering whether the
young president may not be “temperamentally
fitted” for his job, after all.
“Bally Who” : Australia waits for a wax-
works that can take a joke. The shows here
lack humor, the fault also of Madam Tus-
saud’s collection in London. Patrons walk
round talking in whispers, and there is a
morgue-like hush where conversation and
laughter should resound. It is different in
some parts. At Bremen I saw a waxworks
that had interest from the first turn in the
stairway you ascended on entering. As you
rounded the curve you came on a vision of a
young thing with her shapely leg resting on
the balustrade while she adjusted a ver-
milion garter. The lady was only wax, but
she set many a heart fluttering. Further
on there was excitement for the flappers. A
beautiful young man stood fixing his tie be-
fore a mirror. Girls would take fleeting
glimpses'and the reflection would wink back
at them. The wink was automatically con-
trolled, but it kept the flappers guessing.
There was a gruesome side to this show in
addition to its lively chamber of horrors. In
a room “for adults only” was a big array
of realistic representations of physical de-
fects caused by venereal diseases. Men and
women viewed together the best argument
for the narrow path that I’ve ever listened
to.
“Glen Huntly” : Even in the most simple
matters the Law’s delays are calculated to
drive a citizen to direct action. A Mel-
bourne man, holidaying in Sydney, con-
tracted ’flu and was removed to a private
hospital. Later, the cobber with whom he
had shared a harbor-side flat paid their
joint account, and, packing his friend’s
clothes and instructing a carrier to call for
them, returned to Melbourne. The ’flu
patient was subsequently informed that his
property would not be delivered until what
he (and eventually an S.M.) regarded as a
bogus account for £3 19s. 6d. was paid.
Failing to obtain the haberdashery with a
magistrate’s order, the Melbourne man’s
wife summoned the proprietor of the flat.
Followed a wait of seven days before the
case could be heard. Half-way through
this period the Melbourne man was in-
formed that he could leave the hospital, but
lack of pants and other accessories com-
pelled him to linger (at 28s. a day and
sundries) until the'Law got a move on. A
magistrate dismissed the claim for debt,
described the action as one of the most un-
just he had encountered, and ordered the
restoration of the clothes, with 375. 6d.
costs, about half the plaintiff’s legal ex-
penses. Since the detention of wearing ap-
parel, even for a just debt, is illegal, surely
there should be some swifter and less costly
method of restoring a kidnapped shirt to
its owner!

Australian Branch: J. A. BURKE. 5 Primrose
Dick Whittington's record » has been
knocked badly by William Webb, who went
west at Port Fairy (Vic.) the other day.
He had been seven times mayor of hi*
town. Of his 89 years, 67 were spent at
Port Fairy, and for 40 of them he was on
the borough council.
“Herbstantliu”: We live in Gyrnpie (Q.).
Yesterday the fruit vendor, whilst making
his usual professional call at the pantry
door, got off his bit of gossip. "Some say
Bill’s wife looks fatter than when she left
Australia and that Bill looks older. But
/ don’t see no difference in ’em at all.’
‘‘Bill” was Major-General T. W. Glasgow,
K.C.8., D. 5.0., etc., just returned from
various victories to his home town and the
people who know him by his first name.
T. 11. Hiley, ex-general manager of M.L.
railways, stepped off the Auckland wharf on
to the Remuera a few hours before the news
was let out of the drastic cut in the train
services to meet the shortage of coal. Hiley
came to the islands full of new ideas which
would have made tile old hands sit back if
they had come into effect. But a war came
close on Hiley’s heels, and he divided his
ingenuity between railway reform and camp
construction. A highly-paid billet awaits
him in the land he belongs to.
“Orallo”: It looks as if we are to have a
by-election in the Maranoa (Q.) soon.
Present-member J. M. Hunter is expected
to go to London as Agent-General. T. A.
Spencer, ex-M.L.A., is on the war-path in
the interests (he says) of the primary pro-
ducers. He is an auctioneer, undoubtedly
popular, and J. Hr A. McDougall (late of
the pulpit) will have to go his hardest to
beat him. McDougall bails from Toowoom-
ba, and came into prominence through
urging Australia not to vote for conscrip-
tion.
Westralia’s gold production shrank last
half-year another 33,5000 z., and is now less
than one-eighth of what it was in the days
of boom. On the areas of misery known
as the dry wheat belts cocky gets a suste-
nance allowance’ from the State as an induce-
ment to carry on and get further into debt.
But the gold prospector who pegs a block
has to battle on his own or go under; and,
if he is lucky enough to strike anything,
the reef must be of dollying grade to enable
him to hold on. The famine prices charged
for stores, steel, dynamite, etc., settle him
otherwise.
From the Gallery : —-
Watt has lately developed an almost Hughesisli
tendency to juggle with simile and metaphor. While
holding forth on the no-confidence interruption by
Higgs, of Capricornia, he alleged that his enemy had
“ransacked the dustbins of rumor and gossip” ; had
“blossomed only in Opposition and failed to bloom
when he was occupying the Treasury benches”;
and had “shown himself in all his stark nakedness for
the first time.” Poor Iliggs, too, “had got into a
morass of contradiction,” and was '“like a bullock in
a. bog.” All of which was quite entertaining and
emphatic, Yet, when somebody expresses a lack of
confidence in Australia’s ability to produce' all her
own requirements, Watt is by no means* perturbed.
When it isn’t Nationalism but nierely Australia that
is sneered at, he can hardly raise enough spirit nowa-
days to say “Rats!”
“Flinders”: Labor-Opposition-leader Phil
Collier’s stock is slumping in Westralia.
The elect of Boulder is a good debater, with
an', attractive personality, but he lacks
“guts.” During the Fremantle wharf
trouble he played down to the red-rag crowd,
*-and more recently he cut a shifty figure in a
debate with Senator Paddy Lynch over the
Westralian Labor party’s original attitude
towards conscription. It is on the cards
that W. C. Angwin, one of Fremantle’s reps,
in the Assembly, will displace him. There is
nothing brilliant about Angwin, but he is
a fighter, a straight (if narrow) goer, has
a prodigious memory, and knows the Par-
liamentary game from A to Z.
From an Australian in New York :
Here’s a tale of mismanagement or stupidity.
W. J. Phelan, late 58th Battalion, Canadian
Forces, is an Australian, and for many
years worked at Melbourne Government Printing
Office. In the second year of the war he crossed
from New York to join the Aussies in England. On
arrival there he’ was informed it couldn’t be done.
If he wanted to join the A.I.F. he would have to
go to Australia! Disgusted and disheartened he re-
turned to New York, and after a time joined up
with the Canadians. On his discharge the Canadian
Govt, offered him ICO acres and a loan on very
liberal terms. But he still wanted Australia. So
he dropped into Australia House —to learn that no
inducements were offering to Australians who had
fought with the Canadians! What does it matter?
AVasn’t it a common cause? Isn’t he an Australian?
The Queensland Bureau seemed to be a little better
disposed to listen to him, but could not promise
anything definite. So he has come back here. I’m
not “knocking” the old place. I love it. I’m
merely trying to help correct these awful blunders
and stop other people “knocking.”
“0.K.”: Wonderful how actors ean pre-
serve in old age an appearance of their
youth! The average man arrived at the
sixties is not recognisable by a photo, of his
early twenties, whereas the face and figure
of an elderly mummer present their leading
juvenile lines, hardened and deepened.
Forbes Robertson in a recent picture-show
was to me a startling reminder of the lean,
angular original I saw at the London Olym-
pic more than 40 years ago. I would have
picked him at first glance out of 100 photos,
of hard-faced, scholarly men of the same
type. Young Robertson played only a
secondary, colorless part in Frank Burnand’s
“Turn of the Tide,” nor did I see him more
than that once. Of the more important
characters I remember only the late Henry
Neville and Mrs. John Wood and Alma
Stanley, who came to Australia many years
back as leading lady with Harry Paulton.
Alma Stanley couldn’t have been any older,
to speak of, than Forbes Robertson when
they played in' Burnand’s comedy; but,
though she was a tall woman of striking ap-
pearance. I could hardly identify her at Mel-
bourne Princess’s as the girl I had seen at
the Olympic less than 20 years previously.
Actresses in general don’t retain the same
striking semblance of their bygone selves as
actors, do.


Stop Torturing
Toothache Quickly.
Stopain Toothache Gum
Instantly Ends The Ache
And Helps Save The Tooth.
Don’t put up with toothache a minute. You
don’t have to. Just put a little piece of Stopain
Toothache Gum in the cavity, or around the
tooth and all pain is gone as if by magic.
1W
sj
Let STOPAIN Stop That Boring; Pain.
It fills up the cavity, excluding the air, and
stopping the mouth acids from acting on the
frantic, jumping nerve; hardens quickly, and
forms a serviceable filling that will last for a
long time—until you are ready to have a per-
manent filling put in.
Why punish yourself ? Why endure the
agony of toothache when a shilling box of
Stopain Toothache Gum will quickly restore
your peace of mind ?
Keep it on hand for emergencies.
Stopain Toothache Gum is sold by most
medicine vendors at a shilling a box, or sent

Diarrhoea.
Take It With You.
Tse Firm.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
gave suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
dme and money.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
toay be avoided.
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

The four tame bachelors who adopted war
orphans at Melbourne King’s on Saturday
caused profound speculation as to the time
they would require to develop the necessary
warm interest in their new belongings. As
a matter of fact, it takes the least amiable
of them four acts to discover the appro-
priate paternal feeling, but the process by
which this desirable result is achieved is in-
dicative of the degree of sentimentality to
which the kindergarten drama can be carried
on the stage. Poor old Crocket, the afore-
said least amiable, is a pathetic celibate who
staggers around at the whim of a precious
infant; in fact, the only relief from the
lingering agony of the business is afforded
by bachelor Audrey’s blameless affection for
his own special charge. Through an error
Audrey has acquired a damsel of marriage-
able age, and the story is delayed to pro-
vide some pretty tableaux of maidenly coy-
ness slowly succumbing to masculine brains.
Beyond those tender diversions there is
nothing in “Daddies” .to cause violent ex-
citement. In its radiant nursery innocence
it will delight the children of all ages, but to
many other people it will probably increase
a demand for solids.
. . .. * * *
Jerome Patrick is the Audrey of Ruth
Atkins’s dreams, and no finer promise of
connubial happiness can be offered than in
Jerome’s sweet, insipid utterance and nice
curly hair. Patrick is the American-maga-
zine hero incarnate who produces, an en-
chanting suit for every situation. Ruth,
who is almost half confectionery, becomes
molasses in Margaret Nybloc’s hands, and
often a spoonful of Margaret is enough. All
the same, there is evidence, of sincerity and
care in her rather difficult work in the third
act. Greta Brunelle, as Bobette, isn’t
amazingly winning or girlish, and all that
is demanded of Tal Ordell, Kay Souper and
Iteg Wykeham as the rest of the bachelor
party is a stereotyped effusiveness which in
Wykeham’s case is given an unsuitable vocal
affluence. George Bryant has a certain
gloomy affinity with a part like Crocket, but
the job of arriving at his full social stature
as an impromptu father calls for soothing
cadences of tone which are pure misery to a
man who must roar to be powerful. The
strain on the actor’s voice is shown by the
fact that his lightest pianissimo always con-
“DADDIES,” AT MELBOURNE KING’S.
Jerome Patrick, as. Robert Audrey, in love;
and Roland Rushton, as Parker, who
loved children.
veys a threat of uproar to come. Roland
Rushton is not found inferior for the duties
of Parker, and Beatrice Esmond supplies all
the comfortable comeliness necessary for the
character of Mrs.. Audrey. The small child
Lorry, allotted to Lola Darling on the pro-
gramme, was played with the requisite
babyishness by Elya Powie on Saturday
night. The action of the play occurs In the
Aubreys’ smart home, wherea couple of old
English bell-cords are flourished, presum-
ably to accent the ultra-modernity of the
other appointments.
All’s well with “Going Up” at Melbourne
Majesty’s. Saturday (Peace Day) was
specially remembered in a series of patriotic
tableaux for which Victor Champion sup-
plied the necessary music. All the pictures
were impressive, and the big house handed
each one three cheers.
“The Officers’ Mess” is now six weeks, old
at Melbourne Tivoli, and there is every pro-
spect that it will be twice as old before it is
removed from the active list.
At Melbourne Royal the Tailor-made
Man is still reaching the pinnacle of
affluence with the help .of another man’s
suit of clothes. The hero’s success in
society shows the enormous influence
wielded by a fashionable tailor. Possibly if
Figman had arrived at the Stanlaws’ man-
sion with his coat badly cut or a crease
mislaid not even his colossal effrontery
would have carried him past the first line
of servants. He would most likely have
been held up on the doormat and turned
over to the household’s fiercest Fido.
Enid Bennett is doubling the crush around
Hoyt’s payboxes in
Melbourne this
week. She is fea-
tured in “The
Marriage Ring,”
which holds her to
a crook when
neither profit nor>
pleasure can be de-
rived from the at-
tachment. “Private
Peat” is the war
feature. Virginia
Pearson, the suf-
fering siren, is
again paying “The
Price,” and is once
more charged full
interest for' the
usual arrears. In
“Woman,” at the
Majestic, the film
discloses the femi-
nine capacity for
allurement in four
or five episodes, in-
cluding the first
one in Eden, where,
according to the
producer, the lady
had a pretty taste
in dressmaking. In
“A Lady’s Name,”
on the same pro-
gramme, Constance
Talmadge is a
novelist who ad-
vertises for a hus-
band to provide raw
material for a story.

A one-woman show in Melbourne: —
The Arts and Crafts Society is the. present address
of nearly 100 water-colors by Mabel Withers. The
young artist has painted various bits of the Com-
monwealth, but the absence of a selective vision has
led to the ac-dumulation of pretty, commonplace
scenes which might well be left to the amateur
photographer. In exceptional instances she is deli-
cate and tasteful, and is most becoming when
she tries for a sort of spontaneous lyric impression
instead of a literal transcription of natural effects.
Efforts like “The Barron Falls” and “Mt. Welling-
ton from Bridgewater” fall into the latter category
by the obviousness of their treatment. They might
have been done with a kodak and stained with ihe
necessary colors to catch the eye of the tourist.
But there are little, unaffected studies of Croydon
and other Victorian spots which are lively and
individual enough to hold the promise of a stronger
achievement. Miss Withers will do better when she
develops a richer palette.

Jack Waller, back at Sydney Tivoli with
another “Look Who’s Here” show, offers a
hatful of good music, enough' humor to keep
the entertainment bubbling, and a first-class
acrobatic turn by Archie and Gertie Falls.
The lady partner hangs herself by one foot
from the flies, and shows off her figure in the
Japanese manner while risking her white
neck on the slack rope. When she has
finished stunting she slides down gracefully
nose-first without even disturbing the pow-
der. Strong-man Archie then throws him-
self around in a dazzling solo act, and finally
lifts himself and his partner over a table.
Samson would have retired to the private
hospital at Gaza after trying to imitate it.
Nell Fleming, an American comedienne, first
makes a cheerful clatter and then tries to
put her audience to sleep with a musical
draught with “soul” in it instead of opium.
Arthur Aldrige tenors so sweetly that he can
only be compared to a sugar-bowl in a rose-
arbor. Other members of the co. who will
be remembered and welcomed are Ivanoff
‘ violinist), Wylie Watson (’cellist), Ada
Smart, Howard Hall and Cecilia Gold.
George Welch, Billy Rego and Jack Waller

Harry Lauder is celebrating Peace with

private secretary took a cable form, he did,
and replied in the usual official way that
sounds like a plate of cold porridge falling
into a moat. Muriel Window didn’t cable
her congratulations, being too busy at a
sewing circle.
At Sydney Majesty’s “The Silent Wit-
ness” continues to influence the jury behind
the scenes to bring in a verdict of “Not
Guilty” to the murder charge against Bud
Morgan.
Sydney Criterion was due to reopen with
a revival of “Ivatinka” as this issue of The
Bulletin was going to bed. If nothing
untoward happened Gladys Moncrieff looked
sweet and sang divinely in the principal
role, while Phil Smith, Florence Young and
Reginald Roberts were all up to standard.
At Hoyt’s Sydney house and the Hay-
market Enid Bennett points the vital ques-
tion, “When Do We Eat?”—a story of the
honest and therefore poor little acting girl.
On the same programme the beauty and
grace of Lina Cavalieri fascinate the eye
and vindicate the purity of womanhood by
a dagger kept ready for such emergencies
in the depths of her rich tresses. At the
Australian and Piccadilly William Farnum
goes Mormon-hunting. Robert M. Chambers
collects the royalties on “The Girl of To-
day,” the Lyceum drama’; and South Afri-
can Cynthia Stockley does the same by “The
Claw” at the Crystal Palace and the Strand.
Denis Kohoe having moved on from
Adelaide Tivoli, taking his gentle and at-
tractive Irish show in the direction of Perth,
the spoken drama is having a rest in South
Aus. The Majestic has a ' monopoly of
variety, with the Harry Burgess “revue,”
Villiers Arnold and Miss Ladd, and Jennings
and Gerald, the last a returned soldier in
a military burlesque. In pictures, Wonder-
graph has had Enid Bennett in “Happy
though Married”; and Shirley Mason in
“Come on in” is a good successor. West’s,
showing at the Royal for a fortnight during
renovation of the old Olympia, puts up
Norma Talmadge in a romance of Lo, the
Poor Indian. Pav. and Grand are open all
day, and are a heavy draw to the Peace
crowds in Rundle-street.
“The Looking-Glass” is the latest name
for a theatre in London. It is the old Little
rechristened.
Good little Dr. Maloney, M.11.R., recently
proposed the abolition of the useless State
Governors “in order that the huge debt of
the country might be lessened.” The idea
of Doc. Maloney, who wants pensions for
the aged rich as well as the aged poor, re-
ducing the huge debt of the country is be-
wildering.
T. Smith, of the Melbourne Trades Hall
Disputes Committee, went all the way to
Port Adelaide to tell the local Labor Council
that “the seamen were justified in refusing
to place their case before Mr. Justice Hig-
gins. after his statement that the employers,
if they conceded the men’s demands, would
rue the day.” What Justice Higgins said
was that if the dispute were settled by a
concession to the men outside of the Court
the Government and the community would
rue the day. But truth mustn’t be allowed
to matter when you’re frankly out to make
trouble.
From Sgt. W. J. Stephens, “spruiker to
returning troops” at Adelaide:—
“Butty” (B. 3/7/’l9) criticises an address I
made to returning soldiers. It is correct that I
said we want men to join the R.S.A. ; but I did
not say that we soldiers want to send our own
men to Parliament to dominate the Government. I
never advocated polities in the R.S.A. ; in fact,
I have always fought against politics being brought
into the. Association, As for the Army Reserve,
that is the work I am paid for and if “Butty”
looks up the figures he will see that for June, the
first month I was engaged on this work, I lifted
S. Australia’s record from 300 to 1100.
“Ike Pagliacci”: The sins of pirates some-
times come home to roost. An Australian
comedian consistently pinched the songs of
English performers, and when one or two
came here and found their property stale
they reported the matter to fellow-perform-
ers in London. The Australian presently
went to London, and when he got there
found himself locked out because the chief
vaudeville song and patter writers had been
notified by all the comic men of repute that
if they wrote anything for the newcomer
they need not call round any more. Result
—the comic pincher in an unsympathetic
London, with naught to sing but the songs
greater men than he had already sung to
shreds.
“Glen II.”: “I Lost My Heart in Maori-
land” is the title of a song-hit in the Lon-
don revue “Buzz Buzz.” The ladies who
intone the ditty affect costumes like Car-
men’s, except that they are without hats and
allow their hair to hang. The Maoriland
atmosphere is further accentuated by a
scenic set which depicts a number of hideous
figures that might have come direct front
an Indian temple.
MORE OF 'EM, THANK GOD!
THE CANDID CRITIC: “ Do you mean to tell
me people buy things like this?”
THE ARTIST: "Some of 'em do. I’m. not the
only d — fool in the world!”
This was the war output of one big
English firm (Sir W. G. Armstrong. Whit-
worth) :
13,000 guns and mountings.
14,600,000 .shells.
18,500,000 fuses.
21,000,000 cartridge cases.
12,500,000 complete rounds of field-gun ammunition.
6,000,000 projectiles, completed and filled.
1,075 aeroplanes.
3 airships.
47 warships.
22 merchant ships.
583 merchant ships, with submarine guns and
gear.
100 tanks.
The big English co. knew that the war had
to finish some time, and had its reconstruc-
tion programme all ready. As soon as the
armistice was declared the acres of machines
stopped making shells and the engineers got
to work reorganising the shell shops to build
locomotives—3oo or 400 every year, with
innumerable narrow-gauge and yard locos.
The riverside shops where the naval guns
and mountings were made turned round to
make marine engines and boilers. And so on
right through. That is how England is get-
ting into her stride again. It is calculated
to make an Englishman feel proud and an
Australian—well, thoughtful.
“Bill the Bolshie” tells his secret

Wanted, at Government House, an experienced
Butler. Personal references required. Apply, etc.
Wanted, at Government House, a reliable, steadv
Kitchenman. Apply in person, etc.
Our forger is now at work faking up references for
me from various ducal houses. I nave bought a

course in menu French and sideboard manners from
two brothers who would still have been eminent

their hobby. Meanwhile my off-sider is learning
the kitchening game from experts temporarily under
a cloud. He, too, will have an irresistible set of
forged testimonials when we present ourselves at
the . side-door of Government Hobse. Sir Walter
Davidson will be charmed with us. The A.D.C.’s
will thank God that two trusty retainers are still
left to save the Empire in a time of crisis when
the air is full of banquets. After singing one
verse of the Red Flag in the cellar we will go to
work for the Cause. On the first suitable night
(preferably an 0.8. E. investiture) the soup will be
doped. There will be a dash of chloroform in the
champagne. When nobody is able to protest I
shall mount the table and deliver an impassioned
address on Bolshevism in the Home. They will all
have to listen. The menials, their loyalty under-
mined beforehand, will surge up from the. lower deck
of Government House and cheer. “Comrades!” I’ll
shout, here is a Governor who found his salary
inadequate because of the high cost of living. He
is one of us. He must join us!” (Deafening
applause.) Then we will hoist the red flag and
enrol his Ex. and all present as members of the
First X. S. Wales Soviet. Red rosettes will be
pinned to every coat lapel. After which there will
be no more State Governors, and the supply of
small vice-regal advts. in the dear, old, unsuspicious
S. M. Herald will end.

“W. J.H.”: The late Father Robinson
helped to put more than one singing star in
the musical heavens. When John McCor-
mack was on his concert tour in Sydney be-
fore the war the musical priest was over from
Melbourne, and attended all the songbursts.
One night during the interval I asked him
what he thought of the great tenor’s voice.
“Well, he replied, “I think I liked John
better the first time I heard him.” I scented
a story and got it. While on a visit to
Europe some years before he delivered a
lecture in Dublin on “Ireland.” The show
had the usual musical trimmings, one r.f
the assisting artists being his famous protege,
Amy Castles, who had run across from Lon-
don for the occasion. During the interval
a pleasant-faced young Irishman who gave
his name as McCormack came round to the

SERIO: “ One thing about the s’.age—if ever
you're in trouble you'll always find
someone to take your part."
back of the stage, and requested the Aus-
tralian priest to allow him to sing a song
in the Second part of the programme. The
stranger said he had won a competition prize
and had sung in church, but had made no
other public appearance. Robinson took the
young singer at his word. He was allowed
to sing, and won a heavy shower of applause
with “Kathleen Mavourneen.” Robinson was
charmed by the quality of the stranger’s
voice, and invited him to supper, when they
had a long chat. mcCorinack was eager for
advice, which was enthusiastically given,
i ather Robinson urged him to immediately
go to Italy for study, which McCormack did
soon afterwards, returning three years later
to make his memorable operatic debut at
Covent Garden in “Cavalleria Rusticana.”
“Fax”: The vast and effective khaki-
colored curtains which dress the platform
at Melbourne Auditorium have lost two
features of historic interest for concert-
goers. The curtains were introduced to Aus-
tralia by Bauer, the Bavarian pianist, at
about the time the war broke out, and the
central decoration of each of them was the
figure, in heroic size, of the Bavarian Lion
rampant. The Bavarian beast may have
been intended by Bauer to express defiance
of the British ditto; but the pair of raging
animals were objects of shocking interest
only on account of their extreme indeco-
rousness. Nothing but the antiquity and
national significance of the design could have
saved those emblems from a charge of in-
decency. The curtains remained with the
Taits after Bauer’s departure, and for years
they have been identified with the Audi-
torium, hanging there a long time before the
management was struck by their double
objectionableness. By the young and giddy
they are much missed.
“Bally Who”: In Australia the clown
doesn’t get his fair share of the circus.
European (Conti-
nental) shows hare

values, and main-
tain that only
through the clown
can the right spirit

and an inventive clown rapidly becomes a

“Roland Foster” : Walking along crowded
Broadway on our first evening in New York
I heard my name called, and, looking round,
saw Malcolm MacEachern, our burly basso,
and his petite helpmate, the Hazel Doyle of
yore. Last encountered them in Collins-
street, Melbourne, on the eve of their de-
parture for S’Africa 15 months ago. The
MacEacherns have survived the ’flu —
although Malcolm’s death at sea was re-
ported in S. African journals. He is sing-
ing at the Strand Theatre on Broadway, but
will shortly be leaving for London, having
had a good offer to transplant himself. Also
playing on Broadway are numerous mum-
mers hailing from or known in Australia —
Cyril Keightley and his wife (Ethel Dane),
starring in “A Little Journey”; Harry
Sweeney (of “Within the Law”), Bert
Levy (still at the Hippodrome) ; Leon
Erroll, who goes hence to the London Hippo-
drome at a salary of £150; Irby Marshall
and Leonard Willey, playing together in
“The Burgomaster of Belgium”; charming
Dorothy Camming, Tom Bradon. John B"ck
and Stapleton Kent (“Turn to the Right”).
“Petramos” : It isn’t true that the clever
stage kid seldom becomes a clever stage
adult. Most often it does, and there are
dozens of famliar Australian names .to
prove it. W. S. Percy. leading comedian
with J. C. Williamson till he went abroad,
starred along with Charlie Albert at such
an early age that occasionally the pair had
to be carried home to bed after the show.
Maude and May Beatty and others of the
Pollard combination were expected to and
did do well in later life. Nat Phillips and
Roy Rene (Stiffy and Mo), possibly the
bige-est individual dividend-payers in Aus-
tralia at present, were kid performers.
Ethel Bashford was thought so highly of
at seven that Maggie Moore took her off
to America. She is a leading lady ndw.
Nellie Fallon was a baby artist. She was
recently selected by the S’African Theatre
Trust to take a co. of girls to that continent
and later tour the world. Eileen Boyd was
a smart dancer at eight, Lizette Parkes a
brilliant kid in vaudeville, and Walter
Cornoch “the wonderful boy soprano” at
seven. Though all can go further they are
now doing better than well. No, the kids of
yesterday have mostly arrived, and some
more will be here to-morrow. Latter
include Gerty Cremer, Olga Agnew, Cecil
Haines, Linda Foy, Dorothy Seacombe and
others who are at the awkward age when
they neither fit Fauntleroy’s pants nor
Camille’s deshabille. Certainly some clever
girl kiddies are missed from the stage
when they grow older, but that’s because of
their preference for a home and a husband.
“Vaudeville Veteran”: Daisy Jerome could
handle a matinde audience better than any
other performer I know. Whenever a baby
cried and the mother started up the aisle in
order to get out of earshot, Daisy would
stop the orchestra and call out, “Don’t go
out, madam. I don’t mind the little dear,
and if I don’t mind I’m sure all these good
folk here don’t. God bless the little babies !”
I believe the first time Daisy got this off
it came from her own good heart. It went
so well, however, that ever after she
hungered for at least one crying kid per
matinee.
“ Jeune Premier”: “The most beautiful
woman in Melbourne”—so Lolita Robertson,
the imported leading lady of the Fig,man
Company, is advertised by the J.C.W. firm.
Which seems to show that mere man, tailor-
made or otherwise, cannot, after all, be
depended upon to draw like a professional
beauty.
“Protection”: Re “First Old Man’s” par
(B. 10/7/T9) on the work provided local
mummers in “The Tailor-made Man” cast,
here’s the other side of the picture. The
Williamson advance paragraphs prepare
them for eight imported people when the
latest American success, “Lightnin’,” strikes
this crazy continent.
“Fax”: Died at Glenferrie (Melb.) the
other day, old Mrs. Matthews, sister-in-law
of once-famous Julia Matthews, at whose
feet the gilded youth of Australia knelt in
the long avo. Florrie Matthews, daughter
of the vivacious old lady just deceased, went
to England a few years back and married
Fred Duprez, well known on the vaudeville
stage. And only last month anotlu* daugh-
ter, Sadie, set out to join her sister Florrie.
Sadie Matthews was a teacher of dancing
and elocution at Glenferrie for 20 years,
and she left a class behind her.
Taken his last curtain, Sydney James, one
of the most entertaining showmen that Aus-
tralia has made merry with. About six
years ago he arrived from England and in-
troduced his Royal Strollers. The sparkling
show, led by James and his famous dummy
“Billy” and Madeline Rossiter, the re-
markable dancer, caught on at once. The
public never tired of Sydney James’s ven-
triloquial turns, but probably nobody got so
much fun out of them as the ventriloquist
himself. He had an amazing affection for
Billy—had made his reputation with him—
and when, during a season in the Little
Theatre (Sydney), Billy had to be fitted
with a new head his boss took it very re-
gretfully. He was touring in India when
peritonitis blacked him out at 40.
“Ancient Prompter”: A showman on the
grand scale was Imre Kiralfy, who died at
Brighton (Eng.) recently. In ’6B he or-
ganised a big fete in Brussels, including a
snectacle in which 4000 soldiers were em-
ployed. Thus early in his career he proved
facile princeps at handling big crowds. The
much-bcomed German, Max Reinhart, who
took the stage 30 years or more afterwards,
wasn’t in it with Imre. In ’69 Kiralfy
went to America, where he remained 25
years. In conjunction with the one and
only Barnum he produced “Nero” in New
York with 1500 performers in the cast,
afterwards staging it at Olympia, London.
“Columbus” was another of his tremendous
spectacles, employing hundreds of mute
mummers. In 1895 Imre became Director-
General of the Earl’s Court exhibitions,
London, where he remained till 3912. He
was 72 when he passed out.
“Snoilt Actor”: Why does “Glen IJunt-
ly” CB. 10/7/’l9) include “The Way of
the World” amongst Wycherley’s “gross
and immoral” comedies? Alas that the
brilliant Congreve is so little known that
his famous play should be ascribed to an
inferior dramatist!
“Emdoe”: Pirie Bush, of the “Nothing
but the Truth” Co., was an aviator, and had
a narrow escape from being killed through
his machine falling. Bush is too modest
to talk about it. and apparently his press
agent has forgotten.
Allan Wilkie will break a Maoriland
dramatic drought that has lasted since he was
in that country with “Seven Days’ Leave”
14 months ago. During that period M.L.
has had plenty of comedy and high-kicking,
but no solid fare. Wilkie has a repertoire
including Shaw’s “Candida” and the reper-
tory gem “Hindle Wakes,” with in-between
“Trilby” and a sure-fire “Silver King,” Wil-
liamson’s usually jealously-guarded melo-
drama.

Peter Dawson thinks his voice has had
enough rest, so he has left Adelaide for
Melbourne under engagement to the Firm.
The semi-new Grand Opera Co. will probably
absorb him. The latter was to open in
Adelaide on the 19th inst., but the latest
information is that the date will depend on
the duration of the strike and the ’flu.
Cecil Brooking, who was persuaded
ashore at South Africa while on his
to England, has played Sir Dennys Brough-
ton in “General Post” and George B. Nettle-
ton in “A Pair of Sixes” since he landed at
Durban last March. He is now support-
ing Dorothy Rundell (Doris Keane’s under-
study) in Margaret Mayo’s adaptation of
Salisbury Field’s “Twin Beds.”
“0.K.” : Fred Leslie, who made his mark in
London as Ivy Shilling’s partner, has scored
now as a comedian. His part in a musical
medley is a character sketch of “a fatuous
English general who tells his German wife
all his campaign plans”—which, by the way.
indicates a healthy English irreverence where
the intelligence of English generals is con-
cerned. English critics find him not merely
a dancer, but a most versatile and resource-
ful comedian. With Leslie as with little
Percy, h,ard work and extravagance seem to
have found keener admiration in London
than they did in Australia. He was hardly
thought of as a “resourceful comedian” here.
His success in acting parts was based on his
agility, supported by his raucous, incisive
voice and his brisk mechanical style. He
never rivalled Lauri in public estimation,
any more than W. S. Percy did. One re-
members him in “The Orchid” as the man
who returned from the “wilds of far Peru-
oo-oo” chiefly because of his somersaults
with the aid of a walking-stick.
“Jean S.”: “Ox” says (B. 10/7/T9)
that “Hindle Wakes” has “never had a
lust-class professional production in Aus-
tralia.” At any rate, the little drama was
fairly well done by a professional co. at
Melbourne King’s in December, 1916. lan
Maclaren and G. Kay Souper were respec-
tively Jeffcote and Hawthorn; Pearl Helm-
rich’s blonde affability seemed positively
dashing in the part of Fanny, and Nan Tay-
lor had all the necessary vinegar for Mrs,
Hawthorn. I am sure Allan Wilkie will
find a livelier Lothario than Plumpton Wil-
son was, but I doubt if otherwise he will do
any better.

Sir Harry Lauder, speaking on industrial matters

And bush banks for the tiller,
And every bankie would be chook
Wi’ Harry Lauder’s siller. f
From Circ'lar Quay tae Hunter-street
In Pitt-street there’d be twenty,
Wi’ fixed deposits a’ complete,
And payin’ ten per centie.
I’d ha’ a bank next every kirk,
Wi’ a savin’s bank for sonnie,
Where one might bide when free fra work,
And play wi’ bits o’ money.
They’d stand wi’ bulgin’ roof and tower
Tae be a joyous surety
Tae all men o’ the earth o’ our

I’d ha’ a toon o’ banks, I wud,
As full as you could stick ’em,
So they’d spout sovereigns red as blud
If wi’ a pin you’d prick ’em.

Whatever truth there may have been in
the theory that Jack Rice used to feel the effects
of some old injury to his shoulder when he raced
the Melbourne way of the course, it seems pretty
certain that. he has grown out of the weakness in
his old age. Last year Jack ran second for the
Australian Steeplechase at Caulfield, and this year
he did well, under his weight at Flemington. Or
perhaps it H only hurdle-racing, at the faster pace,
which he objects to when his left side is next to
the rails. The handicapper has offered a big induce-
ment for the Sydney horse to have a go at the Caul-
field little sticks next month. Ten-ten looks a
luxurious weight for the renowned humper of heavy
burdens.
*• * • •
Early punters may be fairly safe in pick-
ing Molly’s Robe for the Caulfield Cup, but they
probably take a bigger risk of a breakdown in
backing Menin for the Melbourne Cup. Menin,
.imported, shaped promisingly in the autumn, when
he ran third for the Australian Cup. There was
a whisper about his soundness, however, and these
English horses' are not furnished with iron legs, as
a rule. Last year King Offa was not quite sound
when he won Caulfield Cup, and after his failure
at Flemington he was a clean goner. Had the ground
been hard in Qctober the English good thing might
have been missing from both events.
*,* * »
“0.K.”: The S’Australian crowd reckoned
(before the event) that the handicapper had greatlv
under-estimated Mount Miltsin for the G. N. Hurdle.
They reckoned their champion “thrown in.” Again,
when Tinana was asked to give a stone to Miltsin
in the Doutta Galla Hurdle, the hopeful chaps from
Adelaide thought their fancy had all the best of
the weights. ,What, must they think of the Aus-
tralian Hurdle Race "assessments,.-Tinana being raised
to list. 81b., whereas Miltsin is down to 9st. 81b.?
This time the S’Australian gee would be really well
in—if he were not so bold a jumper. As a rule, he
takes off too soon, and thereby runs an extra risk
of smiting the timber. They are very apt to be
over-rated, these jumpers who make too much (or
too little) of their job. Apd Miltsin is not dead
sure of clearing the obstacle he rises too soon at.
Only the greatest jumpers can afford to add a bit
to the contract. Leah Kleschna; the steeplechaser,
was the safest bold jumper the writer ever saw.
The mare would sometimes take off at a seemingly
impossible distance, but she then put a trifle more
ginger into her spring and got over. No nag
nowadays gets the rounds of applause for individual
leaps that Leah used to wring from the spectators.
Nobody keeps a record of the proportion
of falls in jumping races that happen after the nag
has safely landed and run into a fallen comrade.
Sometimes one mishap makes another two or three,
as in the case of Vanitor, in the G. N. Steeple, who
brought Doiran and Gladful to grief. A jockey may
beware of following near behind a notoriously doubt-
ful fencer, but he cannot greatly minimise his risk
except by taking the lead. When his mount isn’t
one of the rush-ahead sort he never knows his luck,
and the best of the willing pace-makers is usually
beaten at the finish for want of a reserve effort. The
late Booligal, perhaps, went through a long career
without stumbling over a fallen brother, but he
never quite succeeded in staying in front to the
bitter end of a classic steeplechase.
Imported Urney’s past persistence as a
money-waster, coupled, with his present consistency
as a winner, makes him about the most sensational
performer seen on Sydney tracks for many a year.
On Saturday at Rosehill he had his fifth win and
fourth suburban handicap from seven successive
starts. As he was at 6 to 1, the shortest price in
the sequence, and was determinedly backed by lhe
little bunch which has all along had faith in him, he
has now probably recovered a heap more cash than
was ever lost on him. That his past failures were
due to roguishness becomes unbelievable. The fact
is that for the first time a fairly good horse was
got into condition, and it happened in a month
when the opposition chanced to be of poor quality.
Also the 71b. allowance for apprentice riders acted
as a special dispensation of Providence in his favor.
For Saturday he was handicapped at Bst. 101 b., but
as no one can get as much out of him as young H.
Lillyman, and as trainer Tomlinson would'no more
think of putting another jock aboard than of start-
ing the nag in trotting hopples, the handicapper’s
assessment was turned into a jest. Instead of Urney
giving weight to Karanaud King, for instance, that
disappointing animal had to concede him 41b., and
Varico had an advantage of 16oz. instead of 81b.
It is right, of course, that apprentices should get
encouragement to ride—when they can ride. But the
proper place .for it is in races confined to their
division. If they are good enough to compete with
the veterans the handicap should stand. A system
which allows a horse half a stone for carrying the
passenger he appreciates more than any other is
obviously fantastic.
*** ; *
Talking about handicapping, an agitation
is in progress in favor of the A.J.C., when appoint-
ing a successor to John Daly, handing over the job
to a committee of three, or, what is the equivalent,
giving the handicamer “the assistance of two repre-
sentatives of owners.” It is a fool-suggestion. Han-
dicapping is essentially a,one-man job. It requires,
first, a capable man. That is to say, one Who is
observant, judicial and fearless. All of these qualities
may be discounted by ..bringing the influence of
others to bear upon his work. And in any case a
racing' club committee always has the right to call
for explanation of the weight given to particular
horses —and to get another handicapper.
It is no use expecting more from a handicapper
than a handicapper can possibly give. The system of
weight-fixing carries its own particular curses. One
of these arises from the habit some owners have cf
running byes; another springs from variations in
the condition of horses; a third from the varie-
gated performers entered for the various events.
But the greatest of- all curses is the theory that a
handicap must be : framed to “give everything a
chanCe.” The interpretation put upon this is dis-
astrous, for it implies that the good sorts must
be anchored for the assistance of the other sort.
On some men this acts like an obsession; taking
Australian handicaps generally, thev are blighted
by the anxiety of the handicappers to heavily load
the good horse. In a race like the Epsom more
than half of the nominated animals have no more
chance of winning than they,have of sprouting wings.
They arp of the Park Stake variety. Yet to give
them an apparent show they are dumped in at under
7st., and the burden at -the other end of the scale
is correspondingly Increased. It would do good to
racing under handicaps - if for the more important
of these events no nomination could -be -made except
of a nag that had won-once or. twice in a lower
grade before the weights were allotted.

Amberdown ran bis best race since leav-
ing Bananaland on Saturday at ‘Rosehill. Carrying
list. 31b. in the Carlingford Mile, and running with
the leaders to the distance, he was just touched off
in the last stride by the Tressady mare Tressfoil,
who happened to be the more judicially ridden.
Last year’s Epsom boom Amadis was in ‘ the also-
ran division.
* * * *
Word comes from the Saint-Pair-du-Mond
stud of the death of ’Kizil Kourgan, one of the most
noted of French mares and the dam of imported
Kenilworth, sire of Wolaroi and Kennaquhair. She
was remarkably successful in her own country, win-
ning, among other races, the French One Thousand
Guineas, Oaks and Grand Prix de Paris. ’ She
passed on her staying powers to Kenilworth, and
he is siring a line of stayers himself.
Melbourne dailies never .tire of bemoaning
the bad luck of the poor bookmaker. “The book-
makers were very unlucky in the Footscravy Steeple-
chase on Saturday,” says the Argus. Were they?
They got out of paying a Whole heap of money
wagered on Lumut, because hacker's, not being aware
that the horse had not started (rain was approaching
ami the course was in semi-darkness), threw, away
their tickets when the numbers went up. When ail
intimation was hoisted dozens of bettors were ob-
served making diligent search for the discarded
pasteboard; but a Flemington crowd on a muddy
day is not merciful to things placed where they can
be trodden on.
Whitmore Carr, chairman of Adelaide
Racing Club, has surprised it by announcing that he
will stand for the vacancy (caused by the death of
George Bagotl on the committee of S.A.J.C. The
two clubs are practically level in their resources,
meetings and stake-money, the chief difference being
that the A.R.C. gets the bigger crowds, through its
course being on the parldands of the city, and con-
sequently having a flat free to all. But the S.A.J.C.
is the ruling body in the State, and to it (for
example) all disqualifications have to be referred.
Carr should add strength to any committee. He was
sporting editor of the Register at one time, and for
years past has been chairman of the Adelaide Stock
Exchange as well as of the A.R.C.
* * * *
Port Adelaide Racing Club has had to
stand a heavy loss over its recent action in stopping
a race-meeting which had just begun. At its mid-
winter meeting it was obvious . to stewards and
jockeys alike that the running in the first race was
dangerous, on account of recent rain, and proceedings
were promptly adjourned for a week. During that
time the “law officers of the Crown” got to work,
and found in the Totalisator Act that no one club
may use the machine more than seven days in a
year. Till quite lately this would not have affected
the Port club, which was not taking its full allow-
ance : but recently it has prospered, and now uses
all its seven days. The one-race meeting had to
count as a day, so conclusion of it was impossible,
and the club is returning all fees and gate-money as
far as it can. t
Where are the “coming” English cham-
pions? Consider their tennis team to meet
S’Africa in the first round of the Davis Cup. It
consists of Lowe (who won the Covered Courts
Championship of England in 1910, and who had
been playing in first-class company for seven years
before that). Roper-Barrett, IvingscOte and Mavro-
gordato, winner of . the Welsh Singles as far back
as 1905. Every one of them is a veteran, and
all but Kingscote are middle-aged or close up. It
is the same with cricket. England doesn't appear
to have any Kippax.es or Punches coming along ; it’s
all Hobbs and Hirst and Rhodes.
Ron Thomas, w!ho with P. O’Hara
Wood won the doubles Championship at Wimble-
don, beating Lvcett and Heath in the final
after putting out the “certainties” Brookes and
Patterson, was horn at Caltowie (S.A.), 30. years
ago. He started playing tennis with the Hyde
Park Club, and it was not long before he worked
up to Inter-State honors. He was considered a
second-grade player in Australia. Yet when the
British Isles team visited South Aus. in 1913 he
showed better form than any of the other local men.
Prior to enlisting he had an electrical-engineering
business in Adelaide. He is rather delicate looking,
but has remarkable stamina. He is a clever boxer
and was featherweight champion of his troopship
when going to the Front. His father, by the way,
was in the Indian Army and was a noted swords-
man. He is still living.

The N.S.W. v. Q. Rugby League tussle
occurred at Sydney on Saturday. In the first half the
slippery N.S.W. backs—although their forwards were
defeated regularly in the scrum—made hacks of the
Queenslanders; and gave the home team a lead of
23-5. In the second N.S.W. rested, and Q. piled
up 13 points to A At the final whistle N.S.W. led
33-18, and the total about represented the play of
the teams. The bright spot was the left-foot kick-
ing of A. Oxford (N.S.W.), who converted six out
of the seven tries. Two/kicks from near the touch-
line were equal to anything seen on the ground.
The try-getters for N.S.W. were the elusive Les A.
Cubitt (three), Harold
Ilorder, who fractured
his collarbone (two),
C. W. Prentice and
R. Vest (one each).
On behalf of Queens-
land the nippy half-
back, D. Thomson,
played the best game,
with little support
from most of the
other backs; while by
kicking two goals he
added glamor to his
chance of a jersey in
big football. N. Pot-
ter —a very fine for-
ward, especially near
the line—was the pick
of the Northern scrum,
and scored two tries;
and C. Thoroughgood
and M. Johnson scored
one each.
D. THOMSON,
late A.I.F.,
Captain
Queensland Rugby
League Team.
The worst phase in this season’s Rugby
League big football matches -at Sydney has been the
weak high tackling. The Maorilanders were especi-
ally feeble in this respect'in the early matches; and
Q. was close up. It is one explanation of the fact
that in five games N.S.W. scored 104 to 77 v. M.L.
and 33 —18 v. Q.
* * * *
The A.I.F. Rugby Union team downed
the Bananalanders at Brisbane on Saturday (after
a fairly even struggle, up to half-time) by 38 —7.
The Ryanites have —with exceptions, of course—
always been lacking in the finer points of the game.
They trust to brawn chiefly, and it has proved a
frail reed, not a single game having been won by
them v. N.S.W. up to date. But the mild and
gentlemanly touch is by no means always success-
ful. Thus the Y.M.C.A., who-,stand on the bottom
rung of the N.S.W. Union Rugby Premiership ladder,
are noted for their very correct play, sporting spirit
and absence of “dirty work.” And they have so
far registered but two points against ’Varsity and
Glebe-Balmain, who lead with 16 each.
At football Souths over-ran Melbourne
(94 —27) on Saturday, and they now stand at the
top of the Leasnie ladder, with 32 points, as against
28 amassed by ’Rov, ’Wood and Richmond. ’Wood
gave Saints a bad iieking (91 —39), Curtis and Lee
playing a great game for the winners. Incidental
to the routine work of outing Geelong, Richmond hit
up the remarkable score of 111—16 goals and 15
behinds. Melbourne, the club which didn’t play
during the war, continues to be rewarded for its
patriotism with a points total aggregating nil.
* * * *
Adelaide Police Court has been consider-
ing whether a policeman’s work is more strenuous
than a footballer’s. Constable Dayman was charged
with having left the force without giving the full
month’s notice required. He pleaded that he had
acted on doctor’s advice, apd had not worked since
he left ; to which “the Crown” replied that he is
still the star of the North Adelaide team, and
played in the recent inter-State match. The P.M.
called it “a distinct breach of discipline.” Fined £2.
Football in Adelaide is particularly in-
teresting this season. There have been many close
finishes, a straight kick or two extra making all
the difference between a win and a loss. Sturt
is in the lead, with only one defeat, and it is
significant that, in the. whole list of League goal-
kickers, four of the first six are Sturt men. The next
clubs in order at present are West Torrens (much
improved lately) and North Adelaide, equal; Port
a close fourth.
11. K. Foster, against whose team the
A.I.F. played a draw at Hereford (Eng.) last week,
is one of the famous family who learnt their cricket
at Malvern School, where their father was a master.
The best-khown is “Tip” (R.E.), who made the
record score of 287 for a test match while here in
1903. He died a few months before the war began.
There remain six others, all of whom play for
Worcestershire. Nevertheless the Diggers made a
show of the county on Saturday, Gregory taking
seven for 56 and Lampard two for 24 in the first
innings—the whole side being out for 120. The
Fosters, by the way, are all first-class Soccer players,
and they are even better at racquets than at other
games.
*■ * * *
The Yillers-Bi'etonneux . Handicap at
Victoria Park (Sydney) on Saturday was won by
Sylvanell. This mare has the curious yet profitable
habit of striking form whenever there is a big race
on. Some time back she wSri’hi division of each
of the thousand-pound handicaps at Victoria Park.
Yet up till the meeting at Ascot on Wednesday of
last week, when she took the second division of the
Flying, her form had been poor. She is aristocrati-
cally bred, being by Sylvaiiite—Pretty Nell, and
consequently a half-sister to ntivless a celebrity than
Cctigne.
For the last couple of seasons there has
been a remarkable dearth of good dogs, both in
N.S.W. and Vic. At the Vic.' Waterloo Cup meet-
ing last week only 52 nominations were received,
and three of the last four left in—Banjo Girl,
Benjamin and Taluban —were- puppies. The winner,
Banjo Girl, is a nicely grown bitch by imported
Thrilling Deed—Lady Banjo. Her sire was sent
to N.S.W. by whisky-man Thomas Dewar as a
present to Messrs. Keighery and Bateman, a couple
of eminent local pub-keepers."
The Metropolitan Coursing Club ran off
a two-days’ meeting at Liverpool (N.S.W.) ’ast
week-end. The principal event was the Fairfield
Stakes for maiden puppies. Twenty competitors
faced the starter, and the winner turned up in
Peggity, a brindle bitch by The Dickens (imp.)—
Bride’s Veil. She is a litter-sister to Micawber
and is the property of a well-known Liverpool
identity who wears a good-natured red face above
a clerical collar. The winners of the other stakes
were Green Leaf (London Swell—Green Rose, lhe
latter being litter-sister to the famous Beauty Spot) ;
young Corsair (Corsair, imp.—Daisy Dell) and one
aptly named Dire Disaster (White Hope, imp.—
Darling Downs).
Buchan, winner of the classic Eclipse
Stakes at S'andown (Eng.) last week, is the Sunstar
colt who ran second in this year’s Derby. His
dam was bought in foal from the Bass stable by
the Anglo-American sporting M.P., Waldorf Astor.
Buchan's dam, llamoaze, is a Musket, her sire, Tor-
point, being by Trenton.
*** . *
Billy Tingle (Sst. 41b.) and Jack Brown
(Sst. sAlb.) boxed a 20-round draw at Brisbane
Stadium on Saturday night. A big crowd received
the decision in a comparatively amicable spirit.
Georges Carpentier knocked out Dick
Smith, the English “heavy,” last week in the eighth
round. He has been disastrous to the great Smith
family in his time, having previously knocked out
“Cyclone,” beaten Jeff on points and won on a
foul from the Irish-American “Gunboat.” Car-
pentier’s last big fight, previous to this, was with
Kid Jackson, at Bordeaux. He won on a foul, and
it was five years ago, almost to the day.
* * * *
Bob Gray won from Dave Hall on a foul
at Sydney Stadium on Monday night, the paper-
weight championship of Australia being involved —
for what it is worth.
Ern Waddy and Albert Lloyd (heavy-
weight champion of Australia) drew at Adelaide
Wondergraph on Saturday night. Harry Stone, the
Yankee welter, organised the affray, and proclaims
his readiness to stage profitable high-class bouts
at all weights, the inhabitants of the saintly S. Aus.
city being allegedly boxing, as well as dancing,
mad.
Sergeant Loveday, of M.L., won the King’s
Prize, which is the Blue Ribbon of rifle-shooting,
at Bisley this year. It is the first time a Maori-
lander has lifted the event, though Addison did the
trick for Australia in 1907. Loveday put up the
useful score of 253.
The race between Alf Felton (of Aus-
tralia) and Ernest Barry for the world’s sculling
championship should be a fairly good thing for
Felton, if he is up to his Parramatta form. Barry
has turned 35, and although a rare Bill Beach
may be in his prime as an oarsman at that age, the
English champion is now a veteran. He won the
title in his early twenties, and was then said to
have formed his style when he was a youth.

The aeroplane joy-ride lias arrived. At
Hendon, outside London, a youth took an impromptu
flight in a machine that didn’t belong to him. The
magistrate charged him £lO for the fly.
“S.A.R.” : I think Australia’s most versa-
tile athlete must be Vic Richardson, an officer of
the S.A. Agricultural Department. He plays inter-
state football and cricket, battles for Sturt in first-
class club football, is the leading member in Adelaide’s
premier baseball club, and represents Sturt in first-
grade lacrosse. When he has time he is a top-
notcher at tennis, and heads Unley’s gymnasium,
where he plays basketball or boxes.
WALSH—CHAMPION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Men play at cricket, cards or bowls:
Some bet while others won’t:
Some hasten where the ocean rolls
And fish or swim. Some don’t.
Some clothe their fists in gloves ai.d fight.
Tom Walsh’s only game is Skite.
He plays in Singles on his own,
Wherever crowds are rife;
And now and then his skill is shown
In Doubles—with his wife.
There is no risk to life or limb —
A feature which appeals to him.
To Skite you simply mount a box,
In park dr street or hall,
And curse at what is orthodox,
And vehemently bawl
Defiance at existing laws,
And claim to represent a Cause.
A bobby’s threat counts twenty-four,
Arrest afurther ten,
A Court conviction thirty more,
While “Game” is chalked up when
A magistrate—some bourgeois clod —
Supplies you with a term in quod.
The man who plays at Skite aright
Achieves a lot of fun:
The crowd applauds him day and night
And (vital this to one
Like Mr. Walsh), in .many ways—
Financial and the like—Skite pays!
\ 1 y - - V . . /
Wives weep, that Walsh may win his game
(But not the wife lie owns),
And childfen starve. (He feels no shame;
IHs have no cause for groans.)
He is a wonder, of a ■, sort,
A champion at his brand of sport.

From time immemorial rare jewels have ever exercised their fascination and
made appeal to the love of beauty latent in every personality. To-day
Rhoda Wager strikes the note of perfection in this art of personal adornment.
Out of the mists of antiquity this jewellery gathers a tribute of barbaric
splendor, while modern ideals of dignified simplicity and exquisite taste
are modified and blended by a master mind, for every examplq is separately
designed and wrought by hand, so that each piece is delightfully exclusive.
A tribute by Julian Ashton: —
“Their spontaneity, freshness of design, and excellent workmanship, the
certainty of taste with which the color of the gem is matched by an appropriate
setting, conspire to place these works on a high plane of artistry....”

State Governor Stanley got rid of his
doctors early this month, but developed ’flu
soon after escaping from his sick room and
had to go back. He steams off to his ances-
tral acres next month to join his wife, who
has not been very well herself.
The owners will feel sad if the State Gov-
ernment decides not to retain Stonington as
a vice-regal residence. It is out of the way
as an official residence, and was so small for
its purpose that a second house had to be
rented until a fresh batch of buildings were
erected for the genthelps.
Melbourne celebrated Peace Day with a
procession of khaki and captured artillery
under a heavy, ominous sky. State Excel-
lency Stanley took the salute at Federal
Parliament House, and politicians, mayors
and other unimportant dignitaries and their
ladies were stacked in gloomy tiers behind.
It was a raw day for a sick Governor, but
his duties were not specially onerous, as the
last leg of the not over-numerous contingent
flashed past 40 minutes after the first had
reached the Cocked Hat. Mostly skeleton
details endeavored to make a brave show,
but the crowd was more fascinated by five
big ’planes that gambolled daringly aloft.
Later on hoodlumjsm made an extended
matinde appearance, and boys led by louts
derailed tramcars and made mostly ineffec-
tual attempts to invade restaurants and
theatres. One party charged the Grand
Hotel, and being ejected passed a resolution
of no-confidence on the doormat.
The threat of another mob of youths
compelled the Taits to borrow a squad of
bobbies in the evening. Helmets clustered
round the one door of the King’s which was
opened for admission; but, despite the dis-
turbance and the lack of trams, first-nighters
must.. ed in full force. Circle and stalls
were remarkable for a revival of swallow-
tails and chic feminine toilets, cerise, blue
and green clamoring in conspicuous cases
for notice. The show of “Daddies” brought
out whole Tait clan, who are all inter-
ested in children, and the eye could hardly
travel anywhere without tripping over a
Tait or some other treasured appurtenance
of the family. Other celebrities found some
memory of their own kids awakened by the
nursery on the stage. Ex-Gaud Mayor Hen-
ness.v was well up in front, and his lady’s
ermine cape kept envious shes in the throes
of mental arithmetic. In a downstairs box
Beatrice Holloway, pink and smiling, got
the loud hand from an affectionate house.
On Friday night the Melbourne Club
started its Peace rejoicings with a dinner to
returned-soldier members. Several of the
invited were unable to attend owing to
family mourning. The club’s honor-roll in-
cludes the names of Lauchie Mackinnon.
Reggie Power, Gordon Landale. Rupert
Clarke, Arthur Staughton. Russell Clarke
and Grammar headmaster R. P. Franklin.
It wasn’t Peace Day but Hunger Day.
There was hunger and cold in Melbourne
and Adelaide and Hobart and .uaunceston:
hunger without the cold all the way round
the coast from Townsville to Fremantle;
hunger even in Papua. It was a sample
day of Bolshevik government; in fact, it
was a foretaste of the Bolshevik paradise,
mostly brought about to gratify the diseased
vanity of Tom Walsh and his Pankhurst
wife, two birds of passage who can flit from
among the ruink which aren’t their ruins in
any case.
One of the most debonair men on parade
for the Peace Day march was recently-
returned Lieut.-Colonel h?t. Clair, D. 5.0.,
of the gunners. Anyone with a name like
St. Clair ought to be a matinde idol or a
Harrison Fisher hero, and the tall and
youthful warrior is just like that. He left
in 1915 with Grimwade in the bi’igade that
contained so many other old boys of Mel-
bourne Grammar. A long-waiting and
anxious mother died a few months before
he got back safely.
The sale of the late Albert Miller’s fine
old crusted dinner-waggons and other an-
cestral belongings brought a fleet of motor-
cars to Whernside last week, when there
was a two-days’ auctioning of a mellowed
collection of all sorts. To the casual
dropper-in much of the substantial furni-
ture was quite uninteresting when com-
pared with the bits nowadays produced by
Melbourne’s up-to-date furniture-builders;
but the cash results showed that there are
still people who don’t mind a cobweb or two
when there is something good underneath.
Because he is a good sort, Capt. J. G.
Little, retiring Melbourne manager of
Howard Smith Ltd., was asked to dinner
by the floating staff of masters, officers and
engineers of the co. the other evening at
Carlyon’s Hotel. The guest of honor took
home a permanent reminder of the occasion
in the shape of a gold watch, chain, locket
and matchbox.
There was bitter disappointment in the
Chirnside family at the inexplicable failure
of Mrs. Audrey Harold Pape’s dog to win
the Waterloo Cup on Saturday. The un-
worthy animal was beaten for the event by
a short head. Mrs. Pape is a compendium
of information regarding dogs—as on all
other sporting matters —and so is her hus-
band. His particular line, however, is
horses. His performances in the saddle
have been such as to make Melbourne gasp
with admiration this winter. Before the
war he was rather a well-known English
steeplechase rider.
London Bank manager Morrice Williams
leaves next month for Sydney, where he
will reside permanently, thus breaking at.
association with Melbourne of over 50 years
Throughout the war he did valuable work on
the State War Council, War Savings Com-
mittee. and as treasurer of the Red Cross.
One of his sons, Charlie, went through Gal-
lipoli, won an M.C. and was killed in
France. His other son, Clive, a bachelor
of laws, also served as a lieutenant.
Mrs. Collins (widow of the late doctor),
a well-known figure at Federal Parliament
House, where she takes an unaccountable
interest in the debates and listens to the
views (if any) of members over a cup of
afternoon tea, is in hospital with ’flu. Latest
reports were that she was progressing satis-
factorily.
Both of the new Vic. Supreme Court
Judges are mild-mannered men who had a
habit of addressing ’s Honor as though they
had hold of him by the laoel and were tell-
ing him something for his own good. But
in apnearance they are poles apart. Schutt
is big, grey-haired and genial ; Mann, small,
dark-haired, keen-faced, and with a parch-
ment-like complexion. Sc'hutt, a son of the
late Supreme -Court librarian, is 51, and in
his young days was a hefty Essendon foot-
baller ; Mann, who is 50, took a hand in the
S’African unpleasantness.
The courage that held Sister E. M.
Donaldson to her job when h.e. was spell-
ing a warmer word
all round has been
duly rewarded with
the Royal Red
Cross. Sister Don-
aldson was seven
months in field hos-
pitals,, and often
within gun-range,
before she was
transferred to the
13th General Hospi-
tal at Boulogne.
After helping to
mend damaged Dig-
gers in France, she
went on to Netley
Hospital, and to-
wards the end of her
term she was one of
the special angels
on the ambulance trains running all over
England, Scotland and Wales. Sister Don-
aldson is a St. Kilda girl, but it was the
Geelong Hospital that made her fit for her
four years abroad.
So the Savage Club again acquires a
Supreme Court Judge for its president, and
can hold its head up when it meets the
Athenaeum, which has been preening itself
on the recent elevation of one of its mem-
bers —popular “Billy” Williams —to the
Bench. Having a president who wears
horsehair threatens to become a habit with
the Savage: it has had John Madden, and
before him Edward Holroyd, and now it is
good-natured William Schutt. When Schutt
reached the Club to preside at a Peace
Night smoke-concert, 24 hours after his
appointment was announced, the Savages’
roar of welcome threatened to lift the roof
off, and must have proved very distressing
to membei’s of the staid old Yorick, which
is in the same building.
Lieut. Reg Raleigh got back last week.
He is Mrs. Jo Raleigh’s only son. Her son-
in-law, Medical-Captain Percy Webster, is
steaming home again after nearly three
years in the field.
Archbishop Mannix’s former private sec.,
Father Oliver O’Ryan, who served under
him at North Melbourne when he was co-
adjutor to Dr. Carr, is to succeed Father
Robinson, temporarily or permanently, in
the Camberwell parish. The new man will
get a broad hint that in future the whole
of Catholic Australia must not be taxed to
keep things going at Camberwell.
The Rajah of Pudukota and his wife are
to hurry back presently and see that every-
body is paying the elephant tax as usual.
As soon as that tiresome duty is done the
potentate will resume his ultna-British
tailorings and move on to the south of
France. Mrs. Pudukota has told her pals
to look out for sister Ida Fink on the films.
Ida is now playing small parts in Cali-
fornia.
The Mermaid Society for the production
of Elizabethan plays is being heavily sup-
ported by the Best People. Culture is now
more important socially than chiffons. The
first lot of dramas will be staged in Merton
Hall, an adjunct of the Church of England
Girls’ Grammar School, and it is hinted
that professional stars will give the fine old
plays a chance. Amateurs would probably
blight them. Artist Mary Allan has been
commissioned to paint the Mermaid posters.
Humphrey and Co.
supply this study of
Lieut.-General C. B.
B. White, who, as
C h i e f-o f-S t a ff to
Bridges and Bird-
wood, worked hard
with the Diggers
from the first days
on Gallipoli to the
last minute in
France. In several
stunts shells started
following him about,
and on one occasion
a huge missile
dropped on to his
motor just after he
had left it, and blew
a horrible vacancy
for a car and chauf-
feur. White comes from St. Arnaud (Vic.),
which has produced a quantity of expert
riflemen, but he began his military life m
Bananaland and had his initial whiff ot
war in S’Africa. Now only 4.2, and charged
with advising on the organisation of the
future Australian army, the General has a
restless life before 'him. Soon he will be
needing a dray to haul his decorations,
which include, beside the inevitable
K.C.M.G. and C. 8., the D. 5.0.. M.C., Bel-
gian Croix de Guerre, and Gold Medal for
Merit from little Montenegro.
Adelaide hears dance music again:—
After being dormant since 1914 the ’Varsity Ball
has been revived, and about 700 turned up at the
Elder Hall to enjoy it. The Chancellor and Miss
Murray and Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Wallman (he is
President of the Sports Association) served as hosts
and hostesses, and the Governor arrived in time to
see the march of debutantes (64 of them) and dance
in the first set of lancers. Neither lighting restric-
tions nor absence of suburban tranjs and trains makes
any difference: private and semi-private hops are
occurring at the rate of dozens a week.
Our Navy League report shows that the member-
ship has increased by about 35 per cent, in the year
and over £lO,OOO has been raised for various sailors’
funds. And our Cheer-up Society’s balance-sheet for
the half-year shows an expenditure of over £lO,OOO
—most of it spent on entertainment for the homing
Digger.
On Tuesday the Governor opened a three-days’
“Japanese” Fair at Unley, the proceeds for that
suburb’s memorial garden. A Queen Competition
put Mrs. Villeneuve Smith (Queen of Law) at the
head of the list, but she renounced her title in
favor of Mrs. Jagoe, who was Queen of the Red
Cross and has herself made more than 2000 gar-
ments for soldiers.
A f6te in aid of the .Society Maternelle was
opened by Dolores on Monday. Her speech was
brief and eloquent. Afterwards, in the Downer-
Hackett music room, she sang the Marseillaise,
looking very pale in her long black cloak and
close-fitting toque with its floating veil.
The projected Methodists’ Hospital is assured;
more than £20,000 has already come in. The
first step was buying the Simpson Newlands’
house on Avenue-road; to that they have now
added the W. A. Magareys’ house next door ami
Ru Rua Hospital. The two last-named properties
they take possession of at the end of the year, when
they will own more than half the big block next
to the Children's Hospital.
The Teachers’ Conference unearthed some figures
that should stir up educationalists in this State.
All grades of teachers are underpaid. Junior
teachers in S. Aus. get from £24 to £6O a year
if they are men, and from £lB to £4B if they
are women, with a boarding allowance of' £2O:
as against £72 for both sexes -in N.S.W., with a
boarding allowance of £3B. Headmasters in the
other States get from £530 to £550 ; in S.A.,
£475. First assistants (men) get from £3OO io
£350, and (women) £2BO to £350; as against
£240 and £2OO here.
The Returned Soldiers’ Conference brought us
returned Diggers from all over the Common-
wealth. On Thursday they lunched at Government
House and were tendered a civic reception. A
suggestion was made that Miss Campbell, the girl
who has done so much for the Diggers in Durban,
should be asked to visit Australia; but as she has
already explained that it is impossible for her 1o
come, it was decided to send her a photograph of
the Congress and a letter of thanks.
Ex-Flight-Lieut. Freddy Grimwade took
Jo Askin Foster for better or worse last
Thursday, and the Toorak Anglican Church
overflowed with guests and spectators. The
bridal gown was of white cr§pe de chine and
silver lace, and the train of silver brocaded
ninon. The veil, lace yellow with age, is
an heirloom in Mrs. Norton Grimwade’s
family, the Whittinghams. The three brides-
maids were Poppy and Doris Foster and
General Grimwade’s girl Gwenda. They
rustled along in carnation-pink topped by
hats of transparent black tulle banded with
silver, and silver flower belts. Captain Faulk-
ner, M.C., M.M., was best man in place of
Naval-Lieut. Grimwade, who could not get
across from Jervis Bay for his brother's
marriage. Little Gordon Grimwade, in a
white sailor suit, and the Tommy Grant-
hams’ small daughter, in rose pink georgette,
held up the bridal train. Geoff. Straehan
was groomsman.
After the ceremony Mrs. Foster hostessed
the health drinking at the Grimwades’
Toorak house, Homeden, which was gar-
landed with pink flowers. The newlyweds
finally hurried through a bombardment of
rose petals. The bride’s going-away costume
was blue jersey cloth and a silver tissue hat.
The male principals all wore khaki, and a
guard of honor lined the church steps under
the command of Colonel Crowther.
The wedding 0 f Colonel Carre Riddell’s
younger daughter, Winona, with Anglican
cleric Potter, of Romsey, was a morning
event. The bridegroom’s father, Archdeacon
Potter, made all fast with the assistance of
Canon Snodgrass. The bride, who is a
grand-daughter of the late N. S. Wales Chief
Justice Stephen, fluttered in white embroi-
dered georgette with a satin train. Her held
was shrouded, in the tulle veil worn by
cousin Beatrice Madden-Baillieu on her
wedding day. The bride’s sister and a brace
of cousins, Nita de Fergely and Alison
Stephen, bridesmaided in blue, with black
hats l'osetted with blue set with pink roses.
Captain Brian Armstrong, M.C., was best
man and Lieut. Consett Carre Riddell
groomsman. In the afternoon Colonel Carre
Riddell and his daughter held a wedding-tea
frivol at the old Elsternwick home of the
family. A fine selection of the Very Best
assembled for the confetti throwing.
“Buck” Knox having been temporarily
disabled by ’flu, his wedding with Mildred
Syme, which was fixed for last week, stands
adjourned for a fortnight.
Her young hero having returned from the
war, Miss Gertrude Anderson, who recently
resigned her post as instructress in physical
training in the Education Department, is
on her honeymoon. The bridegroom is
Lieut. A. M. Gillies, 8.A., relieving State-
school teacher, who will probably blossom
into an inspector in the near future.
The pretty little Melbourne girl with the
bobbed coiffure who started life as Doleen
Robb, and is at present Mrs. Crompton
Forrest, is healing the divorce-court scars
by marrying . Captain Tommy le Bart.
Doleen, to fill in time, strutted the stage for
a little while with Muriel Starr.
The dental dance in the St. Kilda Town
Hall was a success in spite of the stoppage
of evening trams. The hall was a maze
of khaki and chiffonery under festoons of
autumn leaves, with a storm-burst of crystal
beads from the .middle of the ceiling. A
flag decorated with a mammoth molar (the
dental students’ trad„e-mark) hung from the
end gallery. The jazz had been barred by
the programme committee, and the fox-trots,
one-steps and waltzes were varied by
lancers, through which six debutantes flut-
tered blushfully. None of the young things
knew the figures of this ancient dance.
Medical-Colonel Springthorpe and his hand-
some wife took part in it. The supper-
room, as usual, suggested a football scrum
or a distribution of famine-relief. The pro-
ceeds will drop into the scholarship memorial
fund.
The other day the non-clerical staff of
Federal Parliament House begged for a
little more cash to enable them to keep
level, with the high cost of living, and didn’t
get it. The Australian Parliament still
suffers the scandal of married officials with
families trying to struggle along on about
£3 a week; and while the matter of a rise
is left to the unsympathetic consideration
of the Speaker and the President of the
Senate, who are usually ardent economists
in the lower, grades, the little extra that is
asked for will not be readily conceded.
Spurred on by Father Claffey. the parish
priest, the Catholics of Hawthorn have de-
termined to complete the beautiful Church
of the Immaculate Conception—all but the
towers. _ There is £2500 in hand, and the
other £4500 is to be raised in the practical
fashion of planking down a fixed sum
monthly till the total is reached. Hawthorn,
by the way. topped the list of district con-
tributions for Newman College.
Neuritis has temporarily removed Fred
Young from the command of Her Majesty’s
stage. Fred, who is a brother of Florence
and Mrs. Tallis, has been one of the J.C.W.
stage-managers for years, and many friends
will be sorry to hear that his smile is not
on view at the old address.


DEWARS
Resolution and
Stimulants!
There is, as is well known, a strenuous effort being- made at the
present moment, to persuade people to form various kinds of
resolutions in the matter of alcoholic stimulants. That those en-
gaged in this endeavour are actuated by the best of motives there
is no doubt. At one time the people are asked to abstain from
stimulants in any shape; at another to take stimulating beveiages
only with food. But, marvellous to relate, not one word is uttered
about the quality or class of the stimulant to be taken 01 abstained
from. The fact that there are wholesome, beneficial, exhilarating
beverages which may be taken in moderation with profit to health
and welbbeing. seems to have greatly escaped recognition.
If the consumer of stimulants would but resolve to take nothing
harmful, then perhaps the world would go very well. Investigation
and analysis have proved that alcohol in beveiage fotm is either of
assistance to mankind, or it is injurious in the fullest sense of the word.
The distinction between good whisky and its deleterious imitations
is referable to the constituents employed in the preparation, the
method adopted in the manufacture, and the treatment to which the
product is afterwards subjected. Unless pure specially selected
materials are used it is impossible to produce anything worthy of the
name of “Whisky.” The product may have all the appearance of
whisky, and by a process of artificial coloring and flavoring may be
made to resemble the real thing. But the imitation is nothing less
than a source of the gravest danger to health. In place of being
pleasantly and harmlessly refreshing, it for a moment only, produces
a feeling of exhilaration, but it is an intoxicant merely, instead of
being what true whisky really is, a healthful sustaining' beverage ; a
nutrient as well as an exhilarant.

COUGHS ARE DANGEROUS.
USE TAR AND SUGAR TO GET
QUICK RELIEF.
Coughs and colds are dangerous because,
if neglected, they so frequently lead to more
serious complaints. Pneumonia, bronchitis
and lung trouble would be almost unknown
if coughs and colds were taken m hand in
time. To be sure of getting prompt relief
and to prevent danger of your cough becom-
ing deep-seated, you should always keep on
hand a supply of bitrate of tar cough syrup,
which can easily be made at home for a
nominal sum by dissolving half a pound of
sugar in half a pint of hot water and then
adding 2 ounces of bitrate of tar. Stir
thoroughly, pour into a pint bottle, and when
cool it is ready for use. One or two tea-
spoonfuls of this simple, inexpensive home-
made cough syrup taken every hour or two
will quickly relieve coughs and colds, loosen
the phlegm and clear out the head in a
most astonishing manner. Tickling throat
coughs, may usually be stopped by slowly
dissolving in the mouth a lump of sugar on
which you have first put 15 to 20 drops of
bitrate of tar. Be sure to ask your chemist
for the bitrate of tar, as this is a most suit-
able form for use in cases of coughs or
colds, and is also very pleasant to the taste.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
FOR
SMART
MILLINERY
Roof and window and doorstep and every
available inch of space along the route of
the Peace Parade was black with humans
on Saturday morning; and on every second
face was the determination to show the
proper spirit, and rejoice at the proper
moment as scheduled by the Powers in the
land.
Of all the decorated avenues none other
had the dignity of Macquarie-street. From
the Arch of the Allies the wide, sunwashed
way sloped down, flashing the green glad-
ness of Domain and Gardens to the faces
of holiday-makers, with bedecked buildings
for their background; and in the distance
the harbor waters dimpled radiantly.
Where Bent-street curves into its aristo-
cratic sister the Munro Ferguson took the
salute. He arrived on the magnificent
charger that lan Hamilton bestrode on his
visit to the Commonwealth ; and Sir Ronald
sat his saddle with a great deal more ease
than one of the staff sat his nag. State
Commandant Lee had an anxious look in
his eye, as though he were calculating train
time-tables.
Suddenly came into view the splendid
rainbow formed by the flags of the Allies.
Then the Soudan veterans followed the
waggle of the kilt as the Scottish pipers
played them on their way. Owing more to
the limitations of the human throat than
to set design, the cheering was spasmodic.
When favorites came along there would be
a burst of hand-clapping and some cheers;
then a portion of the parade would salute
and pass on in almost complete silence, to
be greeted lower down the line by their
particular barrackers. “Fighting Charlie”
and Airman Watt got a loud hand ; the blue
and gold of the Navy fitted snugly into the
color scheme of the day, and the sailors
from the New Zealand were got up in
irreproachable marching kit, hats and all;
the South African veterans, mostly in
civvies, raised a yell of welcome; and the
peaked hats of the Maorilanders were greeted
with cries of “Kia-Ora!” The men who
had stood behind the guns rumbled past,
and found that their work had not been
forgotten; but the Infantry, the foot-
sloggers, got the fullest throated cheer of
the day, as they went past in their long
easy stride to the strains of “Boys of the
Dardanelles” and “Australia will be There.”
The Y. Emma brought a grateful cheer in
memory of many wets and eats, while a
spotless mile or two of V.A.D.’s staggered
the housekeeper with suggestion of per-
petual washday. One woman exclaimed:
“Heavens, they’ve just reminded me that
there’s something wrong with the electric
iron!” But the pets of the whole pro-
cession were the bulldog, with his red, white
and blue favors, apd the demonstration
horse bearing his bandages with meekness.
Suddenly there was a hush. The notes
of the Last Post rang out, and Anzac
Bugler Ivirley sounded Sydney’s In Memor-
iam for its soldier dead.
On the higher seats of the gaily-decorated
stand the maimed soldiers and the nursing
sisters watched the flash of sunlight on
bayonet and listened to the tramp of march-
ing feet and the rumble of the gun carriages.
In the lower enclosure officialdom and its
friends preened themselves. Here it was
that Premier Holman greeted allcomers on
behalf of the Government. Lady Helen,
with a new toque for the occasion, arrived
with Captain Finch Knightly; their State
Exes., with an aide apiece; all the Allied
Consuls (what horrible complications might
have arisen if the .Consul for Greece, say,
had been overlooked!) ; the whole Fuller
family; Dumaresq, of the Australia, and
enough gold rope to moor a battle-cruiser;
the mayoral Richards; all the Ministry and
his wife.
xYnd at home many a wife and mother
sat waiting for the fifty or sixty thousand
boys who have not yet come home, and for
the greater number that never will come.
The city was not all rejoicings.
Commodore Dumaresq held a huge At
Home on the Australia in the afternoon
while the regatta was in progress. The
women walked the decks in narrow sil-
houettes (thank goodness the bunchy petti-
coat is going out!) and some of the men in
high hats. It was a homely gathering; no-
body was fussed over. The G.-G. and the
State Ex., with their ladies; Mr. and Mrs.
Holman, with Portia imposing in black
velvet; and the gentry lunched on the Oster-
ley, which was the official flagship, but later
retired to the comparative seclusion of the
Australia. Lady Helen was quite magnifi-
cent in sables over warm-toned wool and
silk frocking. The quiet elegance of black
velvet clothed Lady Davidson. Other titles
aboard were well frocked by the Coghlan,
the Cook and the Fuller dames. Comedian-
reformer Lauder’s little wife walked about
in smart tailorings, accompanied by John
Tait and Dr. Arthur. Consul Segaert
sported a naval cap; Mrs. Henry Hill
Osborne deprecated a brigandish cloak with
a picturesque hat; the Consul for Finland
was in the most correct calling kit. And
the joyousness of nations was added to by a
pair of red, red stockings worn by a tall
lady in navy tailorings,. There was fancy
craft afloat, the full-rigged Victory drawing
all eyes; and the Tingira boys’ decorated
boat won great admiration. But, on the
whole, the crowd was lazily content to just
rejoice in the warm comfort of the after-
noon.
At night the city made glad eyes at the
stars. Tall buildings aglitter with thou-
sands of electrics flashed out the word
“Peace,”' and the dove (in many cases so
plump a dove that you knew there had been
no wheatless day for her) brooded above
high doorways and cooed the lesson of
humanity to all who have the listening-
heart. Then the bonfires blazed around the
harbor; the searchlights sent out moths of
light that beat their silver wings against the
velvet of the sky; the waters of Port Jack-
son acted as reflectors for the glory of the
warships. Other magnets were the Com-
monwealth Bank, with its dazzling flags;
the Allies Arch ; and the tableau of Peace
in front of the Customs House. Crowded
street and clanging tram; confetti-thrower
and the reveller with his tickler —on them
all the stars looked down serenely; and
later, towards midnight, quietness fell upon
the city; and the stars were left to beacon
the world.
The big function of the evening was Mayor
Richards’s stag party. Over 500 men
fathered to absorb the mock-turtle and cham-
pagne in the vestibule of the Town Hall,
brilliant with bunting, masses of sweet pea,
and the glittering brilliance of the five-million
candle-power crystal candelabra that by day
suggests a decollete female walking the
streets in sunlight.
Helen Maearthur Onslow, elder daughter
of the Colonel of Gillibulla, Menangle, will
say “I will” to Captain Stanham, at the
Parish Church, Menangle, next Saturday
(July 26). The following Wednesday the
couple will leave for England, where the
bridegroom expects to rejoin the Army.
Frank Lamb, of Dalgety’s, succeeds Captain
Stanham as private secretary to His Ex.
On France’s Day St. Patrick’s, on Church
Hill, was thronged with devotees to hear
the Requiem Mass for the fallen sons of
France. Father Picquet made the address,
and it was on a wave of exaltation that his
people passed into the streets where at
every second turning the tricolor billowed
in the breeze. Consuls and much wool and
several Ministers were at the luncheon at
Paris House, with as many good Frenchmen
as could squeeze in. But for the concert in
the evening there was an almost deserted
Town Hall: and the combined court of the
Munro Fergusons and the Davidsons was
assailed by a Bolshevik cold that the most
exclusive English aide could not repel. The
programme was under the Verbrugghen
baton. Lady Helen raised an ear from the
depths of a blue-and-gold coat; Governor
Davidson’s wife wore her Newfoundland
furs; and Mrs. Holman listened in an ivory
satin coat that had yards of fringe trim-
ming. French Consul Campana heard the
Marseillaise with a flashing eye; and the
new Belgian consular party were among the
front-sea ters.
Ex-Agent-General Coghlan’s lady says
the most notable thing after the Armis-
tice was the burgeoning of the shop win-
dows with magnificent materials for evening
gowns. Heavy brocades -were soon worn
by young and middle-aged; cloth of gold
and cloth of silver; chiffon velvets so fine
that they were transparent, yet heavy with
small fortunes in bronze, silver and gold
thread. Evening frocks immediately became
excessively decolletd. Within a week or two
Paris had regained her sway as dictator of
London styles. Hairdressers spoke to clients
of the mode of the coiffure, suggesting a
curl here or a puff there, because “they are
wearing it so in Paris.” The pre-war nar-
row-and-tight skirt came back, worn with
shoes and impeccable hose. Up to the time
the Coghlans left London no bootsmith
would undertake to deliver a pair of shoes
under three months, and the price of ordin-
ary Oxfords was £5 12s. Gd. Yet “I think
we’ll return in September,” the little lady
adds.
. Northward bound, aboard a Japanese
liner. Mrs. J. C. Williamson and daughter
Tootles. They will step off at Yokohama.
Walter Swinson, whose clever pianist-
wife is known to London and European
audiences as Beatrice Griffiths, has been
aopointed legal adviser to the British-
Australasian Tobacco Co. Mrs. Swinson
was the brilliant pupil of Henri Kowalski,
and as a young girl went to London with
her mother and two sisters with a view to
furthering her musical education. There
she soon took her place in the first ranks
of musicians. One sister is Mrs. Simpsou,
whose husband is a light in Westralia’s little
scientific world.
By the Orontes Sydney loses Mrs. Stacey
Waddy and her family. Their destination
is Jerusalem, where the old King’s School
headmaster has received an appointment as
canon.
One of the cheeriest dances of last week
was given by the Playfairs to welcome home
son Jack. He went away with the Artillery
and was at the landing at Gallipoli. As
“spotter” for the Queen Elizabeth he was
blown out of a tree, and had his classic
features severely damaged. After a spell
in hospital he went to France, got a D. 5.0.,
and became Brigade-Major.
One of Sydney’s artistic dressmakers
passed out lately in her prime, a victim to
the fashionable scourge. She was Miss
Kelly, of Dixson’s Buildings—in private life
Mrs. Greville Holmes, a vivid personality,
clever and kindly. Miss Kelly was trained
by the late Madame Beatty, the old Czarina
who used to create clothes for smart grand-
mothers and smarter mothers of to-day’s
jazzing younger-set.
To the Peace dinner at the Wentworth on
Friday night young men brought their best
girls, and the girls brought their best frocks;
and with the ices came a burning desire lo
fling tricolored streamers from table to table.
Everybody wore the little paper caps at
rakish angles, and the only thing left undone
was the drinking of the toast of the fair
one from the fair one’s slipper. The cost
of footwear puts an end to this ancient
custom. The Philip Mortons added their
frocking to the sea of color; and Mrs. Tom
Dixsou emulated the first lady of America
and carried a beautiful feather fan to tone
with the gold leaves on her tulle frock.
This is a May
Moore presentment
of the laugiuug,
rosy-cheeked wife of
new Belgian Consul
Seguert. . Madame
has at least one ad-
venture to her credit
—a journey in war-
time from Brussels
to Flushing on a
false passport! Be-
fore coming to Aus-
tralia Consul Se-
gaert was in the
Congo. Madame and
the four children
were there with him,
and made their head-
quarters at Katan-
ga, where the atmo-
sphere, though hot, is dry and healthy. Here
there was no need of carpet sweepers, be-
cause the floors were of mother earth,
iuadame laughs as she tells you “it was
easy housekeeping.” She was the only
woman, and queened it over a little court
of 20 men. Walking and cycling were her
two recreations. One walking tour lasted
eight days; and she claims to know the
Congo from the coast almost to German
East Africa. The Segaerts have gone into
temporary quarters at Pymble.
There was no prettier girl at. the Peace
Ball than Tiki Cameron, the pink-and-white
niece of the Ministerial Fullers. The shoes
which matched her frock, and which she had
such difficulty in procuring, danced right
through the programme. A few days later
the little girl was down with ’flu. She
pulled through that, but a subsequent slight
operation put too great a strain on her
strength; and a few days ago the petals
folded themselves. She was buried in
Kiama, where her father and mother, the
Charles Camerons, are well-knpwn land
people.
People, irrespective of age and weight,
are learning the new steps with profound
earnestness. As a matter of fact, the jazz
is an elderly nerson’s dance —always pro-
vided the E.P. is not handicapped by a
sense of the ludicrous. The jazzer can
either make the pace a w T elter or move
ponderously round, against the music, at a
walk. The latter is the manoeuvre favored
by Society’s 15-stoners, and by the 50-year-
oids and over. The younger division can,
of course, even make the jazz look beauti-
ful. The Levy bovs, young Merivale, clever
little Toto Beith, the Laidley, Morton and
McArthur girls, and practically all the
noddies and sub-lieutenants from the war-
ships are as exnert as professionals. Mrs.
Henry Hill Osborne, Mrs. Clayton (recently
recovered from a serious dose of the ’flu)
and Mrs. Metcalfe Jackson are among the
most graceful of the young matrons.
A belated notice tells of the passing-out
of tall, silver-topped Lilian Spark, from
influenza, contracted during the Paddington
election. Iler record of nearly eight years
on the National Association organising staff
and a great gift of goodfellowship gained
the regard of electors on both sides of the
fence. To her political work she added
much loving toil for the War Chest and
Women’s Hospital.
The widow of that fine old North Qheehs-
land milling pioneer, John Moffat, survived
her husband only a year: she died in Syd-
ney a few days ago. She went north with
him when he took his knowledge of tin frdm
Stanthorpe to Irvinebank, and gladly sup-
ported him in all his patriarchal schemes.
There are not many mining men north of
Capricorn who haven’t a benediction for the
kindly old couple.
Clouds and misty mornings and sparkling
sunshine are the subjects of the Muir Auld
show at the Artists’ Gallery in the Royal
Exchange. The paintings strike a note of
sincerity in tone and color. Mr. Auld’s trees
flash and gleam in the sunlight; his sea-
scapes reflect the blue that is our sky for
at least eight months of the twelve. Especially
charming are “The Top of the Ridge” and
“The Misty Coast.” But perhaps what
pleasures the artist most is the glow of
the red seal on so many of the canvases.
The Paquin of Melbourne is at the
Carlton. In other words, Shave of Mel-
bourne is in town. One tailor-made in navy
cloth with a green stripe, the coat opening
on a vest of emerald green charmeuse, will
content the soul of some Spring racegoer.
Another model carries buttons right up the
front of the coat to a collar that can be
buttoned under the chin. Sleeves are to
be short, so that means long gloves o* after-
noons. The most charming effects for out-
door wear are the jumpers, one of knife-
pleated cr&pe de chine; another the top
piece of a pink turn-out would make any
girl look like Dobson’s Phyllidia who wore
buckled shoon.
Jack Cannot’s cabaret at Coogee had a
big success on its opening night. The floor
and orchestra are good, and the promoter
and his associates made things hum on the
entertainment side. It is going to be a big
success if the jazzing craze or lunacy lasts
over the summer. Surf-bathing, music, re-
freshments and the jazz make a strong com-
bination.
Dear, dear, there’s no telling who isn’t a
revolutionist these times. Hobart World
the other day announced that even our late
G.-G.’s wife, Lady Northcote, had been
made a Dame of the 0.8.TJ.
According to a cable last week Dorothy
Brunton has made her predicted success out-
side musical comedy. If she never returns
to the song-and-dance side of the business
it will only be in accordance with precedent.
Ethel Irving, now England’s most finished
emotional actress, started with small parts
in “The Geisha” and similar productions.
Dorothy lives with her mother and
wounded soldier-brother in a flat in Hanover-
souare. Before demobilisation set in vigor-
ously a stream of Digger visitors, ranging
from generals to privates, poured through
the tiny drawing-room of the place. As no
flat ever owned as many chairs as Dorothy
required, it was common to find field-officers
sitting on the floor, the rule of the estab-
lishment being that the seating accommoda-
tion should go to the injured. The hostess
herself mostly crouched in the fireplace.
H. K. Foster, whose cricket .XI played
the A.I.F. at the end of last week, is the
eldest brother of the late “Tip,” who brought
his wife here with P. F. Warner’s team.
She was a pretty little thing with a passion
for bridge, which was shared by Mrs.
Warner. Poor young Foster was threatened
with consumption at the time, and it
carried him off a year or so later. The
valetudinarian Warner, who with his bald
head and harassed countenance looked '5O
when he was 30, is still going as strongly
as ever—which is a way valetudinarians
have.
A recent Daily Mirror recalls at least
three old Sydney friends. There is a photo-
graph of the Hon. Mrs. Michael Scott, wife
of the well-known golfer; she is a sister of
Mrs. Helen Jerome and was a J.C.W.
girl. The Parker divorce brings to mind a
vision of the sparkling, well-dressed little
American lady who was so popular in Syd-
ney while her husband, Robert Kent Par-
ker, was establishing another record as a
Wagnerian singer. Still another photo-
graph is that of Mrs, Prideaux Brune.
whose dad is Sir Philip Grey Egerton, and
whose stepmamma was S’Rupert Clarke’s
first wife. A woman just back from Eng-
land describes stepmamma as still combining
the charm and beauty of Lady Curzon and
Maxine Elliott, and says that her diamonds
by her first marriage are among the notable
gems of the London season.

These Angle Rings were made far quicker and cheaper with the Oxy-
Acetylene Blowpipe than by Are welding, and the work is accurate, which
is a very important feature.
Metal goods are made easier, cheaper and better by
the OXY-ACETYLENE Welding Process.
CCORES of metal articles made in Australia to-day by old-fashioned
processes like seaming, brazing, riveting and fire-welding can be pro=
duced easier, cheaper and better by the Oxy=Acetylene Welding Process.
Oxv-Acetvlene Welding is used by the greatest metal-goods manufacturers of the world because it not
only increases production and lowers the cost of the article but produces an art.cle of higher selling value.
r>r.P <rreat ad vantage of the Oxy-Acetylene Process is its adaptability. You don’t need to drag the work to the operator if it suits im
better to take the outfit to the job, it is easy to do so. He can work in any position, in any direction, and the Oxy=Acetylene Out it is
entirelv s«lf-conta?ned. Whatever your metal work, from the sheet, bar or pipe, let us show you how to swell your profits and produce
a better article for less than you are doing. You can’t buy an Oxy=Acetylene Welding Outfit unless you need it. Send particulars o
your work to us; we give you expert advice without obligation.

G.H.P.: “The Old Bush Track” suffers
from as many bumps as the man who tries to gell
gridirons in Gehenna Gilbert P. M.: “Monotony”
—has the right heading, at any rate.... Portia: No;
the point is too strained It. Elliott: Your bush
verses are suppressed in accordance with the Peace
terms... .Walnut: If they were as awful as the last
lot, no wonder you heard no more of them.... Quivis ■
Good topical idea spoilt Jim C.: No good with-
out the name of the magazine.... Bellerive: Ah, thb
one has them gasping:—
There was a scene of consternation in the alley,
When a ruffian grasped he’s helpless little son
And exclaimed, “You’ve got the temper of your
mother,”
And threatened for to kill the little one.
Two constables were hurried to the alley,
Prepared to use the power of the law;
Urged to action by the neighbors of the alley,
lloughly they forced open the front door.
Smiling sat the urchin of the alley,
With a towel around his neck upon a chair.
While awkwardly the terror of the alley
Was struggling to cut the nipper’s hair.
....G.R. (Mclb.) : “Winter” vigorous, but neither
fresli nor very interesting. .. .E.W. (Leichhardt):
Heavy fooling. .. .Good Sport: Don’t care for “Phoebe”
... .Sol: Not enough in it. .. .Swarm of Bees: No in-
terest.... Sylvia W.: You want more rhymes, more
thought, fresher ideas... .E.D.T.: Not up... .C. 8.:
You must have had a bad experience... .R.S.:
Don’t hanker after remarks about another day nearer

weighs in short... .Gidya Bill: What is “sheer
disgust,” anyhow? The little shop next door to
The Bulletin says it doesn’t stock it... .Gib-spring:
Returned with compliments—of a kind....K. Sliep-
herdson: Did you ever read “Gunga Din” ?.-...E.D.:
Agree with you this far :■—
If you’ve never tried tobacco smoking,
Take my advice, just get a pipe and try.
It seems to ease your mind of things provoking,
And puff your little troubles to the sky.
Returning the copy. Dress it up... .S.P.T.M.: Don’t
understand it....X. Sapper: Not a point in it
that hasn’t been made before.... Iota: That mystery
of she.ep and lambs is beyond us 1.M.D.: Promise
in them; but they don’t quite do it. ...de B.: Un-
suitable... .C.D.C.: That school yarn has a good
point, but the detail needs to be made more con-
vincing... .A.D. (Coogee): Gloat in more attractive
verse.. .Neta W.: Send us some verse when you’re

cheap verse.... E. S. East: Sorry, but “My Country”
won’t do. . . .L.C.R.: That mad American stuff is no
use here... .Gedry : Too flimsy.... Facetus: You
say the obvious things about Shakspeare as an
excuse for tearing up a photo. Doesn’t seem a sky-
scraping theme for verse. ...P.C. (Chatswood) : Too
thin....K.W.C. :Not for u 5.... Bendig: Doesn’t get
near... .L.C.M.: Poor attempt... .W.J. (Cunna-

school essay... .E.J.F.: Ineffective. Get away from
imitation, and look for a new thing to say. .. .Nemo:
The}' fluttered softly, into the basket... .Doris May:
What does it say that hasn’t been said better 10,000
times?....A Query: It isn’t verse; and as prose it
is shocking J.H. (Q.) : “Himalayan” is spoiled by
the last line of the octet.. ..1.5.8.: We don’t publish
books. It is not well written.... Tic-ta.c: Deserves
more thought and belter craftsmanship C.D.C.:
Don’t care for “Deadmen’s Tales.” “Fire” is one
syllable, unless you’re very tired... .J.M.C.: Com-

well enough done.. . .Kemo: “Walkin’” misses....
M.: Get more initials or a name; there are thou-
sands of M’s.” Verse not up.... Sapphire Smith:
No grip in it.... J.R.M.: Not good enough... .L.F.
(Redbank): Fair verse, but without iriuch in the
way of force or feeling. .. .A. Lane: Poor yarn....
J.A.W.: Ah, now, this is something like:—
A wistful old Wizard away in a cave
Did desp’ratelv ponder his life for to save;
By nine the next morn, he had sternly been told,
A large copper vase he must change into gold!
“If not,” the irrational Caliph had said,
“Artistical torture until thou art dead!”
A dry, yellow parchment he caught from a cran,
Whose weird hieroglyphics to frenziedly scan;
When a Wild roll of thunder the cavern did rock,
Which caused the Wizard to looseth his block ;
Then, fleeing the cave in a maddened condition,
Was o’er a precipice plunged to perdition!
. ...E.J.G.: The day after makes dull reading....
J.W.G.: No use to us. Should sell elsewhere.. .K.W.
(Murra) : Both far below standard... .E.M.L.: “The
Major’s Souvenir” misses in the telling. Try again
.. . B.PAV.: Verse not up.... General: Bumps too
heavily... .M.G.J.: That small domestic row doesn’t
make a yarn.... J.M.D.: You have the material; cul-
tivate a sense of rhythm. .. .B.M. (Oamaru) : Fined
for short weight ... .Deirdre: Idea worked too often
..,.Ivhat Soo: Not nearly enough there... .G.H.J.:
They both miss.... Poor House: Product ditto....
Hopeless: Verse fairly well done; but you must get
out of old tracks... .K.A.E.A.: Horrible, but doesn’t
make a yarn... .5.0.5.: Mad fragment... . J.W.G.:
Misses.. . .M.F. (Maitland) : No use to us.
“Homeless”: Lord knows why they are
doing it, but as I write Goths are tearing
down what must be the only unoccupied
house in Sydney—the elaborate recruiting
stand in Martin-place. Nice central position,
too.
The complaint about the vanishment of
some 6,000,000 bushels of 1916-17 N.S.W.
wheat is rather ridiculous. So many bushels
went into the pool; so many were sold:
therefore, says the animated subtraction
table of the Department, the rest should be
there. But the mice and weevils in the
infested districts ate the stuff till the bags
evaporated and the stacks sagged down.
Then the cats ate many of the mice. Then
the stacks sagged some more and smothered
the cats. As far as possible the weight was
made good by shovelling in the mice, but
the line was drawn at shovelling in the
cats. As for the weevils, they mostly blew
away—tons of them.

There is one thing that cannot he done without in the home —except by
great, and really unnecessary, sacrifice —that is, Music.
The BETTER the music, and the greater VARIETY possible—the more
valuable is the instrument providing it. Therefore
The NEW EDISON
is the ideal
musical instrument.
It provides, not only the best music, but is the only instrument
in the world that Re-creates it.
By Re-creation is meant that the playing or singing of the
artist, cannot be distinguished from the Edison reproduction of it.
(“Reproduction” is too loose a word to apply to the exact, perfect
Edison Re-creation.)
Great artists such as Anna Case, Marie Rappold, Elizabeth
Spencer, Albert Spalding, Arthur Middleton and Dame Melba’s
great Australian protegee, Madame Stella Power, have all stood
before large audiences and, in actual comparison with The NEW
EDISON, proved that it Re-creates a voice or instrument with
perfect fidelity —not even the slightest shade of music, or overtones,
being missed.
Enquire about this unique instrument at once. Learn what
it will mean to you and your family, to have it in YOUR home.

Mr. JOHN BYRNES in Wandsworth No. 3 Hospital, England (from a photo).
REXONA HEALED A SEPTIC LEG
AFTER OTHER TREATMENTS FAILED
Having been wounded at the Front in Gallipoli in 1915, and in hospital at
Alexandria, and transferred to Wandsworth No. 3 Hospital, England, with a
septic leg, I was suffering from 17 wounds, but no treatment that I tried would
cure this leg, and I was four months in bed, and finally discharged in Sydney
with my leg an open wound. Nothing seemed to have any effect on it, and not
iretting any relief from the various private treatments I was advised to try (1
was at a loss to know what to do) until I was advised to try your famous
that the results I got were of the best, for it seemed to
benefit me from the first, and entirely cured this bad wound, which had been
troubling me for so long and which had resisted all other treatments. I am pleased
to say that I am now following my usual occupation without any disability, and
1 believe I owe it to Rexona, so I am writing to tell you all about it. I am also
sending you a photograph of myself taken in bed in the Wandsworth No. 3
Hospital, England, where I lay for four months. rvbnf«s
Sincerely yours, (Sgd.) JOHN BARNES.

WHY SUFFER WITH STUBBORN SORES?
A bad leg or chronic sore of any kind generally has two phases; the local
inflammation and soreness and the impurities existing in the blood. If you
suspect that the system Is out of order or the blood impure, take a course of
Raxo-Tonic Pills to clear all poisonous matter out of the system. Next treat
the sore by frequent washing with Rexona Soap, the pure medicated soap that
reduces inflammation, destroys septic conditions and cleanses the wound of
dead and discharged matter. Apply a soothing dressing of Rexona Ointment,
the Rapid Healer; it'soothes pain, builds new flesh tissue and renews and heals
the skin. Rexona the Rapid Healer is sold only in triangular pots at 1/6, or in
large- bolding nearly four times the quantity, at 3/-. Rexona soap u-
per tablet, and Raxo-Tonic Pills 1/- and 2/-.

A Lay of Surplus Blessed

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MASKED to my eyes beneath a tree
I watched the waters at their play.
The moon was dancing on the sea;
Her gold, too fairy-light to stay,
Sank in large flakes as, two by two,
Their elfin pipes the breezes blew.
One breeze blew south and one blew west
About the corners of the land.
I liked the southern one the best
And stroked it with a kindly hand;
For winds, like little kittens, purr
To feel your fingers in their fur.
The south wind found a little boat
And brought it softly up the tide.
Moon-kissed, I saw it bob and float,
Its sail the veiling of a bride;
And when, at last, it reached the shore
I sprang on board and grasped an oar.
“Where shall we go?” the damsel said.
Her presence there surprised me quite.
A moony glory on her head
Was set for my express delight;
And when she furled the shining sail
Her hands, I saw, were lily pale.
Pale hands; but, oh, her lips were red!
She wore no mask to hide the view.
A poppy, flaunting in its bed,
Glowed never more in morning dew.
I said, “Dear heart, let us go far
To where the moonbeam weds the star.”
“Right-oh !” she cried. I gripped the oars;
Our keel went through the lane of moon.
Oh, ocean has a thousand doors
That open to a golden spoon.
I pulled away my choking mask
And bent my shoulders to the task.
Out, out we went across the sea,
Beyond the reef where breakers foam.
The little south wind seemed as free
As kings in their ancestral home;
It becked and bowed and kept polite
As waiters seeking tips at night.
I dropped the oars; I set the sail.
I heard the sweetest, softest sigh;
I grasped her fingers lily-pale
And very gently asked her why.
She said: “I sighed in maiden fear
Lest we perchance should drown out here.”
“Drown!” I replied. My tone was proud.
“The sea is like a bowl of milk.
I see no sign of mist or cloud;
The very breezes feel like silk;
And I am sure the wisest way
To joy is straight across the bay.”
I felt her breath upon my cheek,
Intoxicating, scented, warm.
’Twas fated that her waist should .seek
The curving shelter of my arm.
Dear heart! Her eyes appeared as blue
As periwinkles in the dew.
The little fish went round and round.
She laughed like apples on a tree
When summer makes a pleasant sound
And milkmaids skim the cream for tea.
She laughed; and then I quite forgot
What some things were and some were not.
But in that pause a cloud arose,
Black-winged about the western sky,
A ready tempest in its nose
And darts of lightning soon to fly.
She saw it first, and then I knew
Exactly what we ought to do.
I turned the vessel’s head to land.
I pulled two oars with all my might;
And then the storm-fiend took command
And all the sea was wrapped in night—
A nigl so black and loud and thick
It made my five swift senses sick.
“Dear heart,” I cried in accents clear
Above the roaring of the gale,
“I fancy that we finish here.
Observe the fitful lightning pale.
But, down below or up above,
One thing remains to us—our love.”
“Yes, love is love,” I heard her bawl,
“But, oh, the sea is very salt!”
The water rose, a night-black wall,
Above our heads —then seemed to halt.
It halted —shuddered —curved and fell;
And smothered our despairing yell.
The little boat went round and round
Full of cold water to the brim;
And there I sat till I was drowned,
Watched o’er by heedful seraphim.
The girl was quite a minute gone
Before I put my new wings on.
But I got quickly off the mark
And climbed the steeps of yielding air.
Behind I heard the tempest bark
And noticed that its teeth were bare.
Yes, lightnings flamed and thunder rolled
But I was snugly aureoled.
I found the girl a million miles
Beyond Orion’s sloping belt.
She cast me down a wreath of smiles
To let me know the way she felt.
And up we winged and found the gate
Where the best Christians have to wait.
Peter was stern of beard and e-ye;
But Mabel gently fluttered past
(That was her name as far as I
Remember whispers at the mast
Before the cloud of doom grew large
And all the winds and seas took charge).
I bowed my halo and stepped in
As meek an angel as might be;
And then, for unremembered sin,
A lady stood in front of me.
“Dear George,” she said, “I waited long
For you to join the Heavenly song.”
And as she spoke I heard a cry
Of rapturous delight from one
Who had a green and gentle eye
And tresses brighter than the sun.
“George! It is George at last,” she said.
“O Love, in yonder shrine we wed.”
And then I heard a laughter shrill
And a soft sound of running feet.
Oh, heart of me,_ keep still, keep still!
’Tis Edith joyous and complete!
And ere I well could get my breath
She almost hugged my soul to death
Ah, well-a-day! My eighteenth love
Had rushed upon me from a cloud;
And looking round and up above
I saw them in a holy crowd —
Dear girls as thick as stars of night
In dazzling robes of bridal white.
Had I loved these? Dear dusks of eve,
Dear dawns on beaches by the sea,
I could but falter, pause and grieve
At loss and lapse of memory;
Edith I knew and Jane and Kate,
But there were hundreds at the gate.
Breathless, I climbed a crystal spire
A thousand feet in Heavenly air;
But those soft pinions of desire
Could chase and catch me anywhere.
Far over Heaven’s high wall I flew
To where the dim star clusters grew.
A thousand years I waved my wings
Across the glory of the light;
And star to star in wonder sings
The tale of that stupendous flight.
At last I thought I beat them all
And landed on a planet small.
Dimly I seemed to know the. place;
And, tenderly, I watched it grow
Familiar as some friendly face
That once in dreams I used to know;
I noticed then the outline free
Of ancient Pinchgut in the sea.
I paused. I breathed the smell of home;
But short my pleasant respite proved.
Above me, fair as rainbow foam,
The glittering girlish phalanx moved;
And, shouting down the air they ran,
With Edith shining in the van.
Then, in despair, I stood my ground
And parleyed ’neath a spreading free.
My argument was strong and sound:
But one of them could marry me:
For Heaven, as all the saints have sung,
Dislikes to house a Brigham Young.
I set myself as holy prize
Of a celestial, starry race —
Nine times around the Milky Way
And back again to Martin-olaee.
They’re off! That simple task will keep
Their sweetness busy while I sleep.
But little doubts assail me now
Of what it all perchance may mean.
The perspiration on my brow
I know has an angelic sheen;
But this I wish some friend would tell;
Are many loves of mine in Hell?
For while, like flocks of homing doves,
Those ransomed, panting bosoms fly,
I wonder if my mob of loves
Can really keep my soul on high,
Or if, for all that radiant show,
The best and sweetest waits below.
N.S.W.
GEORGE STREET.
Between Expresses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
«-|~TURRY on, please!” cried the porters.
Everybody hurried on.
The express, filled to overflowing,
was almost due to leave. Even the exit-
porter was fingering the bell, much as a
poulterer fingers the cockerel he intends to
strangle.
Through the entrance came two girls of
slightly uncertain ages, but eminently
spankers, not to say dashers. In their hands
they bore glad-rag bags of aggressive new-
ness and moderate size, without label and
without direction. .
“Oh, Ethel, where shall we sit? lhe
train’s full!”
“Oh, rats! Come on!”
Up the train they ran, and the attendant
on the forward first-class carriage gallantly
hauled them in, just as the exit-porter
swung the bell. But suddenly the station-
master turned and waved vigorously, almost
denunciatorily, at him, and the exit-porter
skilfully stifled the clapper.
Then the stationmaster, backing convin-
cing action with unconvincing words,
cried: “Hold her, Jim! The Minister’s
still inside!”
And Jim, the guard, put down his whistle
and glowered savagely at the door of the
refreshment-room, then looked at his watch,
and finally stepped hastily towards the
victualling department. He almost cannoned
into the Minister, who was pushing past two
fervent supporters bursting to shout for
him. Excusing himself, the great man retired
in more or less disorder, pursued by a small
secretary, the guard, the stationmaster, a
local reporter, a policeman and a man selling
. the Banner under depressing circumstances
’ of rush and general inattention.
The great man hurried along and was just
about to step on the train, and the guard
and the exit-porter were within an ace of
their whistle-and-bell duet, when a window
of the first-class forward carriage went up,
and an aged, top-hatted head was protruded,
pink and white with indignation and
whiskers.
“Hi !” called the apparition in a shrill,
semi-feminine voice vibrating with sup-
pressed fury. “Hi! Porter! Guard! Where’s
the stationmaster? Hi!”
Inside the compartment whence the angry
head had burst into sight, sounds of mild
recrimination reached the ears of those on
the platform. It seemed that when the two
girls reached the carriage they bad found
all the compartments save one filled to the
lim’t. The unfilled compartment was a
smoker, and most of it was occupied by a
stately old gentleman with innumerable
traps and comforts, who was indulging in an
excellent cigar and reading the papers at
leisure. Having carefully tipped the attend-
ant, he calculated upon a luxurious ride in
private—at the worst the sharing of his

an embrocation for deep-seated pains, such as Rheumatism, Sciatica, Lumbago,
Neuralgia and other affections of the fibrous tissues, Zam-Buk possesses many
superior merits. The refined juices and essences of which Zam=Buk is composed
penetrate right through the tissues, get at the very root of the trouble, and once there
simply drive the pain out. Rub well in to remove stiffness or to get at the root of any
deep-seated rheumatic or sciatic pain.
Zam=Buk has been proved to possess unique virtue as a remedy for cold in the throat and head. Rubbed
well into the throat, chest and back Zam=Buk soaks into the tissues, soothing pain and removing that
“tightness” which is such an annoying symptom of a cold on the chest.
Great benefit is often derived by rubbing Zam=Buk between the palms of both hands and then inhaling the pleasant
odor of the evaporating balsams. This loosens the stuffiness in the nose, clears the head and relieves that dull, heavy feeling.
By using Zam=Buk in this way many a cold and sore throat has been prevented from developing into a more serious trouble.

CRIPPLING PAINS BANISHED.
Mr. Marsh, of Adelaide Street, Brisbane, says:—“l caught
a chill which extended to the muscles of the back and
developed into a severe attack of lumbago, almost crippling
me with pain. A friend, who from personal experience had
great faith in Zam-Buk, induced me to try it. I had it
well massaged into the affected parts, and the result was
immediate relief. This treatment was continued until the
attack passed off, and I have not been troubled with lum-
bago since.”
RHEUMATIC PAINS AND STIFFNESS.
Mrs. M. Martin, of Brisbane Street, Mackay, Q., savs:—
“For sprains, stiffness and rheumatic pains, both myself and
husband have found Zam-Buk a - splendid embrocation for
rubbing in. I also find Zam-Buk especially useful on wash-
ing days, as, after a day’s washing, my hands sometimes
become very sore through the rubbing; but an application
of Zam-Buk at night makes the hands smooth and well by
the morning. As an all-round remedy Zam-Buk cannot be
excelled.”
Zam-Buk is proved unexcelled for chilblains, chapped hands, raw skin, cuts, bruises, scalds,
burns, sores, bad legs, ulcers, abrasions, pimples, blisters, children’s sores, abscesses, ringworm,
barber’s rash, scalp troubles, sore feet, beat rashes, boils, sunburn, festering sores, piles, sprains,
scabs, barcoo rot, insect stings, sore heels, eczema, poisoned wounds, stiffness and injured and
diseased conditions of the skin generally. From all chemists and stores at 1/6 and 3/6 per pot, or

SOOTHES AND HEALS
compartment with one other man—but he
ha<l reckoned without, the spanking Maud
and the dashing Ethel. They-burst in upon
him like a petticoated whirlwind, and be-
fore the Minister had finished his drink at
the bar and had waved off the two enthusi-
astic supporters, a metamorphosis had been
worked in that suug compartment. It was
Maud who threw the old gentleman’s dress-
ing-case into one corner, but it was E'thei
who tipped his luncheon-basket and packet
of books under the seat and put up her two
well-shod feet dangerously near his shining
hat. Only by very great speed did he save
the glorious tile from profanation. Snatching
it up he put it ou, glared at the girls and
remarked gratingly: “Excuse me, madam,
but this is a smoking carriage.”
He waved his shilling cigar emphatically
before replacing it in his mouth. The spank-
ing Maud opened her vanity-bag and mopped
her hot face with a dainty lace trifle, The
dashing Ethel leaned forward and adjusted
a stocking.
“Er —this is a smoking carriage, I said,
ladies.’ 1 ’
t Maud handed Ethel some chocolates.
Neither spoke, nor gave the least sign of
having noticed anything else alive in the
compartment.
The old gentleman’s glare became more
pronounced, and his face reddened visibly, as
lie tried for the third time—and failed.
“You cannot stay here, ladies. This is a
smoking carriage.”
A pause.
"Then I must call the conductor.”
Another pause.
At this moment the attendant looked in
to see that all was right with his prize
traveller. .The old gentleman hailed him
joyfully. “Oh, guard, please tell these ladies
that this is a smoking carriage!”
The attendant, with one half-crown in
his pocket and a second in prospect, man-
fully sized up and seized the situatiou.
Quite right, sir. Ladies, this is a
smoking carriage. I’m afraid you’ll have to
get another seat.”
Ethel and Maud were apparently fathoms
deep in Charles Garvice and W. ,T. Locke.
As far as they were concerned the attend-
ant might have been a blowfly buzzing in
the corridor. The attendant waited a
moment. He, following the old gentleman’s
example, began to glare and grow red in
the face.
“Sorry, ladles, but this is a smoking com-
partment. You cant stay here. The regu-
lations are very strict.”
Maud nut down her book, opened her
pqrse.. and, with a winning smile, held out
her ticket. Ethel followed suit.
The attendant was nonplussed, but he
stuck gallantly to his benefactor in esse and
in posse. “Tickets are all right, ladies, but
this is a smoking compartment. You’ll have
to get out.”
“Well, we won't!" snapped Ethel.
“Oh, won't you? I’ll see about that!”
The attendant was very angry.
“Fetch the stationmaster, guard!” cried
the old gentleman.
“A policeman will dd,” said the attend-
ant. “I’ll have them removed, now, just
to show them.” And he vanished down the
corridor.
The old gentleman put up the window and
stuck liis head out with the effect already
narrated.
At his agonising call the stationmaster,
the guard, the exit porter, the Banner-
seller and all the onlookers turned their
heads like a comic-opera chorus. In the
background a majestic policeman loomed
up in all splendor. His eye caught the
beckoning hand of the train-attendant, and
he bore down in response to the signal.
With him went the stationmaster and all
the cohort of officialdom, while the engine-
driver and the stoker and everybody near
a window garnished the side of the train
with inquisitive heads.
“Constable!” shrieked the furious old
gentleman.
“Officer, there are two young women here
I want removed,” said the attendant. “I
warned them, but they won’t go.”
“What’s the matter here?” asked the
stationmaster, swelling with importance and
indignation. The train was three minutes
behind time.
“Where are they?” asked the constable
laconically.
The attendant led him into the carriage,
followed by the stationmaster and the guard.
As they turned into the corridor a sort of
snorting bellow, or bellowing snort, came
from the compartment they were bound for.
It was the old gentleman who on dropping
heavily back into his seat had seen a sight
that almost paralysed him.
The attendant stopped at the doorway
and looked in, and the policeman looked
with him. The stationmaster and the guard
hovered behind.
“These are the —well, I’ll be !” cried
the attendant stopping short.
Ethel and Maud, two pictures of inno-
cence, sat reading calmly, each smoking a
cigarette.
Maud looked up. “Oh. guard,” she said,
sweetly, “this is a smoking carriage, isn’t
it?”
O. C. CABOT.
Yo the Dog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
II DICK, the cook, watched Scotty
k Saunderson from his galley with the
eye of hate. He could have forgiven
him the bagpipes, though he detested them }
but to steal the love of Yo the dog was a
different matter. Scotty would have to pay
for that.
Standing on the stern of the Donga, Saun-
derson’s body was a black shadow against
the velvet of the sky. The Murray was up
and the flood-waters swirled away for a mile
through the trees on either side of the chan-
nel. Down the long aisles the ducks' fled
from the thrashing paddle-steamer, and after
them crept the eerie echoes of the bagpipes,
like alien things amid the. silent trees.
Though he knew only five tunes Saunder-
son played them with zest while Yo the dog
lay curled up at his feet. The “good li’le
pup” whs his only audience to-uight, for it
had been a long day. There had been many
bales of wool to trundle up the plank from
landing-places to the deck of the Donga. All
the hands who could get to their bunks were
asleep. As the next stop was not due until
early morning he decided to turn in also.
Li Dick watched him go, with Yo the dog
trotting at his heels, and his eyes glinted like
the oilv shafting which drove the paddles.
The black walls of the trees w’ound past,
shreds of clouds hurried across the sky like
homing ghosts, and the engineer dosed on his
perch by the furnace. Gn the bridge the
skippet„was yarning with one of the hands
as he spun the wheel, keening the bows
on the winding, night-wrapped course.
As he sat there and the miles floated by it
seemed to Li Dick that the paddles were sing-
ing a chant which he had never heard before
and yet was strangely familiar. It was a
monotonous, throbbing thing, like the beating
of a drum, heard afar off ou a hot night. It
was insistent, urging, sullen; a song which
had sounded in the ears of Chinese in many
times and places. It was a Chant of Death.
There was a sudden rattle of iron as the
engineer awoke, glanced at his gauge and
unclamped the iron bar of his furnace. lie
tossed some logs in, and a shower of sparks
leapt out of the red hell within. The glow
shone on the pots and pans in the little open
galley, and it seemed to kiss the knife stuck
above the shelf. The red light flickered and
played upon the steel, and Li Dick wondered.
Two hours had passed since Saunderson
had gone, and it would be safe now. He
waited till the engineer’s head fell to one
side as though the neck would break, and
then he took the knife down very gently.
His bare feet made no sound on the deck,
and, sheltering close in the shadow of the
wool-bales, he was out of the view of those
in the wheel-house, though the headlights
stared out over the deck.
The top was off the entry to the tiny
fo’c’s’le, and he lay full length beside it.
Saunderson was sleeping down there, a foot
below him, in the top bunk. He knew just
how he lay, a little on the near side of the
bunk. He leant down into the opening and
stabbed quickly. The knife sank into soft
flesh. Yo the dog, which always slept on
the end of the bunk, yelped in terror, and Li
Dick was gone.
“What’s the matter down there?” yelled
the skipper from above, and the engineer,
cursing, went stumbling along to find out.
Shouts and cries poured from for’ard.
Li Dick reached the stern, pulled the
dinghy up. fell into it and cast free. The
water rushing from under the Donga swept
the boat away into the darkness like a straw,
and the strong yellow river carried it evbn
further astern. Li Dick saw the steamer
pass round a bend, the sparks pouring from
the funnel and the water churning away from
it. Loud voices came to him, muffled
inrough cue web of n.gnt.
In the sweep of water the cook Was power-
less to row, but he steered for the curtain
of trees. The current gradually carried him
into their shelter and he laughed. He was
saved: —saved!
Up above the boughs grated and the leaves
cried. A great swan went splashing away
from within a foot of film boat, and the fitful
moon silvered the water. The clouds hurried
high, and the liquid floor of the lone place
went sliding by. Burnt tree-trunks paced
up to the boat and looked in at the huddled
figure. The oars, had floated away and the
stumps buffeted the dinghy. Frightened
birds went scurrying from it.
Li Dick knew the meaning of these things.
The whole world hated him, and all this
waste of water and tree was toying with
him before it killed. Two stumps held the
boat for a second and nodded against the
sky, hesitated, and let it go. A bough, stooped
down and beat him on the head, and the
water round his ankles chuckled to all the
other blaek-and-silver water which was
watching him.
Then a jagged log seized the tiny craft
and turned it over. The waters leapt at.
him. He struggled with them and floundered
to a great log which seemed almost friendly.
His fingers clawed its sides and then, as lie
made a desperate effort to clamber up, a
ghostly dog ran along its top, paused and
ran back again, like a sentry.
Li Dick screamed, for it was Yo the dog!
He splashed away and the flood-waters put
its arms round him and pulled him down.
The skies and the earth were swept away.
The flood-bound 'fox on the log sent a
frightened bark to the scudding clouds.
* * * *
On the Donga Saundersoh gave the body
of Yo the dog to the river and threw the
knife after it. He was wondering what had
suggested to him to sleep on the bales instead
of going below.

When I Am Dead.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN I am dead wear no sad weeds
for me;
Dim not the lustre of your shining
eyes
With tears in dutifulness shed for me.
Dig me no grave; no„ flowers plant for me.
To bloom in mockery of my decay.
Give this my body to the cleansing fire
And scatter my poor dust to the four winds
To blend again with elemental things.
Mourn not for me on anniversaries.
Write me no epitaph save on thy heart.
And if a soul I have that sentient lives
When this poor husk of me is stripped away.
It will, contented, drift in infinite space
And join the chorus of the singing stars.
