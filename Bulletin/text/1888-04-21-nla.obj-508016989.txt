“The Bulletin” votes for Wittwraith
The natal clay of anew nation is dawning in
Australia, and except for an occasional ob-
scure paragraph in the Press, three-fourths
of this Continent pays not the slightest heed
to the event. The approaching Queensland
election has resolved itself into a question of
Australian Nationalism v. Imperialism, and
the victory of the MTl wraith party will be
virtually a demand for independence in the
near future—the united protest of a great
colony against Imperial servitude. And at
present the signs are that the national party
will win. There is practically no fiscal issue
before the country, for both the political
leaders have gone for Protection, and the
Freetrade faith:— the great prop of Im-
perialism —is not only dead, but buried and
forgotten. The infamous Naval Defence
Bill marks the line of demarcation -between
the parties in the contest, and tire
< ; loyalists ’’ of Queensland have staked then
political existence on the resurrection of that
measure from the dishonoured- grave to
which an angry Parliament so recently con-
signed it. On both sides the cry Is raised,
“'Australia for the Australians !’’ but Grif-
fith's insolent assumption of his opponent’s
battle-cry deceives no one. He and his
party are pledged to make Australia a tribu-
tary of England, to postpone, if possible for
ever, the birth of Australian independence,
to prop up the old regime by which this
great Continent is ruled by a set of sleepy
and ignorant clerks at the Colonial Office,
and by which the cast-off dudes and. club-
loungers of London are sent out to»serve as
the heads of the Australian States ; and un-
less every act of las administration is a living
lie he can no more lead an Australian
National party than An Chew can head an
anti-Chinese crusade.
. - *
The creed of such politicians as Parkes
and Gillies and Griffith is that every man
has his price, but it was only when the Im-
perial authorities undertook the purchase of
Griffith that the overwhelming weakness
of his character was revealed. The A olsli
Samuel was for political sale too cheap.' In a
shadowy, uncertain way he once figured as
the Tribune of the People ; like D alley and
many another bogus Australian, be vapours
even now at patriotic celebrations about the
glory of Washington and his compatriots ;
yet the Naval Defence Bill on which he
staked his political existence in return for
the meanest and cheapest pewter degrada-
tion which the Queen can confer —the de-
gradation which he shares with successful
British grocers and cheesemongers and with
apoplectic mayors without sense or gram-
mar —is a distinct attempt to perpetuate in
Australia the system of taxation without re-
presentation which awoke the less seivile
Americans to fierce'revolt. All through his
career Griffith has led the parQ w huh
holds that Australia was created for the
Englishman, and that the “ blasted colonial ”
was made that the Englishman might rule
over him, and even when he attaches the
Republican motto to his Imperial ban-
ner he commits, himself to no single
act 'that bears any trace of Republi-
can sentiment. He hints, it is true, at
shadowy socialistic reforms if England does
not object ; he suggests that the Chinese
influx, which owes its strength entirely to
his eloquent and impassioned defence of the
Mongolian “brother” some 12 years ago,
should have something done to it ; and he
thinks that Australia should be preserved for
the Australians, and that as a means to such
preservation it should be dominated by a
foreign fleet, and bossed by foreign military
officers, and should pay tribute to a foreign
government. No sadder, weaker, sham-
democratic programme was ever published
to a disgusted world. ,
t * *
The National party in Queensland has
rallied unanimously round M ‘ 1 1. wraith s stan-
dard, and already the “square'’ man of genius
overshadows the insincere man of tawdry pre-
tence and bogus patriotism. The central point
of M’ll. wraith's creed is that Australia was
meant not only to be peopled but ruled by
Australians, and in his eyes the Naval De-
fence conspiracy is merely a scheme by which
this country is to pay for foreign ships and
foreign guns to suppress its aspirations for
independence. His programme of internal
reforms is almost identical with that of
(Griffith a circumstance which is readily
explained by the fact that the versatile.
Samuel of M ales has borrowed his policy in
almost every detail -but while he commits
himself boldly on'every point of the National
programme, his rival merely hints and shuffles
and spreads himself over whole columns
of literary and political garbage without
uttering one word which implies an absolute
promise of any kind. Moreover MTlavratth
stands conspicuously before Australia as the
one politician of this continent whose word
has always been held sacred, while Griffith
holds the proud position of premier shuffler
in a land where statesmanship is synonymous
with mendacity and deception. Vet (! riffith,
like Washington, might claim to have never
told a lie ; in fact, he never required to tell
one. Almost everything he ever promised
to do has been left undone, and almost
everything he promised not to do he has
done over and over again, but he possesses a
potent gift of explanation by means of which
he always shows that nothing he ever said
meant what it appeared to mean, and that
nothing he ever did was what it seemed to
be. His talent has been carefully cultivated
until he ranks as the leading optical illusion
of the Southern Hemisphere, and the head
apologiser and expounder of the age; he is
a creation by himself and has nothing in
common with the elephantine ignorance of a
Parkes, or the coarse stupidity of an Abi-
gail, and he is so far above either that he
could borrow money from the latter without
interest, and could make the former pay
a bill at the first time of asking. In
politics Griffith is the living embodiment
of the poet’s idei that tilings are not what
they seem, and in this lies the secret of his
approaching downfall. For live years he
has abjectly grovelled to England from
motives of pure Australian patriotism ; for
12 years he has been the prop and stay of
the Chinese because, he wanted to keep Aus-
tralia for the Australians ; and now the
country has grown tire (I of this anomalous
ruler, and wants to be governed by someone
who moves in a less mysterious way his
wonders to perform,
• • «
The establishment of an Australian Re-
public is the ultimate goal towards which
MTlwrvith’s policy is directed, and his
name will be handed down in undying glory
to future generations as that of the first
Australian Premier who dared to pledge
himself openly to the National cause.
While Griffith and other politicians of
similar calibre are engaged in drafting-
abject petitions to the British Sovereign that
the latter as our suzerain should be pleased
—if it suits her —to beseech the Chinese
Emperor to restrain his subjects from eating
up the white man’s heritage in the Pacific,
he proposes to boldly assert our right as a
nation to preserve ourselves from ruin and
contamination —-to close the ports of Queens-
land against the leprous host who come as
British subjects under the protection of
British treaties, and to defy the mercenary
British nation to champion—if she dare —
the cause of the unclean myriads to whom
she sells the rights of citizenship at so much
a head. He has recognised the fact that
the southern Commonwealth will only be
established when Australia learns to act as
becomes a free nation, and Australia will,
for the first time, claim her right to be a
nation when she drives the Mongolian from
her shores, and refuses to regard him as a
white man by virtue of a British Act of
Parliament. The expulsion of the Chinese
is an essential part of the great Republican
movement—-the movement which now dwarfs
all other questions in Australian politics. So
long as this continent is dependent on the
British Empire internal reforms only tend to
enrich and improve a land which is not our
own-, —to strengthen a people who are for-
bidden to become a nation and whose
energies——if Griffith and Dalley are to be
believed—are to be for ever employed in
propping up a rotting monarchy on the other
side of the globe. Australia as flic
hanger-on of a foreign Power has no
national ideal to realise, and M‘In wraith
is one of the very few Australian statesmen
who comprehend that this servitude cannot
be maintained that a new race must belong
to itself if it is ever to achieve greatness.
His annexation of New Guinea - though The
Bulletin did not and does not now recog-
nise the necessity of tire act—was a bold
attempt to make that island a part of Aus-
tralia in the present and of the Australian
Republic in the future, and had his op-
ponents chosen for once to sink politi-
cal differences and give him their
support (in patriotic grounds, he would
probably have succeeded in his endea-
vour. As it is, Griffith’s after-representa-
tions have merely resulted in New Guinea
or a fragment of it - becoming an outlying
bit of England instead of an integral portion
of Australia, and this distinction is typical
of Griffith himself. Griffith is an out-
lying section of England ; in his eyes the
Australian must ever be an Englishman, and
he adopts the watchword of ‘' Australia
for the Australians” because to him it is
the same as -“Australia for the English-
men,” and it promises to do better service at
a political crisis. To this shuffler from
Wales, patriotism -apart from Imperial
patriotism- is impossible and non-existent,
and even to this day he is unable to compre-
hend why the people whom he endeavoured
to sell should object to being sold. The
Bulletin opposes Griffith because he is
the .enemy of Australian Nationalism, and
because his intellect is of that kind which
makes it all but impossible that he can ever
he other than he now is, It supports M'l L-
wraitti because he is now almost the only
genuine statesman and patriot that this
continent possesses, because he is the
only man in our political world who is
at once willing and able to lead the
National party and stand or fall with-it,
and, above all, because lus past career makes
it certain that lie is beyond the reach of cor-
ruption, and that he will adhere to the last
to the cause he has adopted. Under lus in-
fluence Queensland, the youngest of the
Australian colonies, has taken the lead in
endeavouring to assert her right to be a
nation, and the old, stagnant communities of
the South are anxiously awaiting the issue.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Regina and Pruchard Morgan.
The Pali. Mall Gazette considers that the
attitude of the Salisbury Government in. re the
Trafalgar-square disturbances necessitates the
General Council of the Law and Liberty League
calling a meeting in the prohibited square with-
out delay. It considers that the claim of the
Crown to regard a public place, created by public
money for public purposes, in which the public
have had uninterrupted right of user ever since it
existed, as if it were the private garden of the
Queen, is so preposterous that it needs but to be
stated to excite a roar of contemptuous indigna-
tion in any public meeting in London. “It is
possible to defend the prohibition of public meet-
ings in the Square on other grounds. It is not
possible before a popular audience to defend it on
the ground that the Queen lias a right to warn her
subjects off the Square as trespassers.” This is
the simple theory of all property in England.
Everything which is'not held in fee-simple by a
private owner is held in right of divine authority by
the Crown. The very highways and byways, the
foothpaths, the ' moors, the commons, the waste-
lands everywhere belong to the Crown. People
walk down a thoroughfare on sufferance-
The very air belongs to the Crown, unless it is
attached in the form of chattel atmosphere to pri-
vate park-lands or rented along with the moors
for grouse-shooting. Not long since a man who
had for weary years toiled and digged and specu-
lated- risked sometimes his life and sometimes
ids fortune in the scientific and practical search
for gold ; a man who had dearly purchased and
rightly held all his knowledge regarding the ex-
ploitation of the rocks for their treasure, went to
England- He held locked in his brain the multi-
farious experiences of a lifetime of toil on
Australian "goldfields. His trained and practised
eye recognised a formation of an auriferous char-
acter in Wales. He had found gold ! But this
practical knowledge, without which the discovery
would have been impossible, is not recognised in
cockle-grown, barnacle-covered England. Great
Britain is not a goldfield, and a recent cable
informs us that the Crown has claimed the gold
found in North Wales, and demands also an
account of the quartz crushed. That gold is the
property of the Crown just in the same manner
that everything else is, including Trafalgar-square,
which is' not owned by a private person. The
gold had lain hidden from the lustful eyes of
men for ages. The old Cymri mayhap had
crossed and recrossed the spot; the legions of
Rome may have camped upon it: the naked war-
riors of Strathclyde may have trodden its surface
under foot, and Saxons, Danes, and Normans,
fierce Gascons and facile Angevins, may have
passed it by in their forays on the Marches ; Red
and White Rose may here have struggled for
supremacy, and stained the little rill which
trickles down the rocks hard by with red blood
and* white corpses —shed and withered petals ;
Puritan, Cavalier, Roundhead, follower of Mox-
mouth or of Orange, Hanoverian or partisan of
the Pretender ; all have missed the discovery of
what all were eagerly looking for, and at the end
of a bead-roll of centuries an Australian, with an
eye for “the lay” of a geological formation,
changes his experience into gold, The English
Crown is so grateful that it , lias claimed the
“fip’ds.” It further “demands an account of
the quartz crushed ! ’
+
barren’s ISIU <’lause,
A determined stand lias been justifiably taken by
the New South Wales Assembly against the pas-
sing into law- of the 18th clause of G,\ krett’s
Amending Land Bill. Any country which .would
stand supinely by and allows any Minister to arro-
gate to himself the Czarish powers in settling the
assessment of run-rentals, now claimed by Mr.
Garrett—a man found guilty of flagrant corsup-
tion by a parliamentary commission, and whose
expulsion from the House was prevented by only
the narrowest of narrow majorities—any country
which would stand supinely by,-we say, and allow
such usurpation of autocratic omnipotence, is not
the country which could be relied on to grapple
with the Chinese trouble. .Should the New South
Wales Government even permit its Minister of
Lands to gratify his lust of power to the extent
proposed, it would miserably and effectually
stultify itself in regard to other measures it talks
vaguely of presently introducing. It is proposed,
for instance, to remove the departments of Public
Works and Railways from the active- control of
Parliament, and from the personal administration
of the Minister of a party, and to place these de-
partments under the management of a com-
mission which shall act independently both
of Parliament and party. And this is to
be done, mark well, in the interests of purity
of administration as it is more than a matter
of grave suspicion that the present system
of ministerial control and parliamentary patronage
is open to charges of the grossest corruption and
departmental manipulation. Why then should so
far superior a matter as the administration of the
Public Lands department—unquestionably the
most seriously important to the country of all
departments— continue, while these great changes
are being effected in other directions of minor
consideration, to be autocratically dealt with by a
Minister who would lie practically irresponsible ?
When it is considered, the almost illimitable
power for pecuniary peculation surrendered to
one of whom the most that can be said—be he
who he may—is that he is but mortal, the possi-
bilities for gigantic fraud are simply appalling.
Not that we claim that Mr. Garrett desires to
hold this power to use it to his own monetary
advantage —far from it. But compute the enor-
mous facilities that would be placed at his disposal
and take into consideration the advantages to be
reaped, not alone by the Minister for Lands
at the time being, whoever he might be, but
also by the squatters who would think it
worth their while to try and bribe a high official
to fix rentals on his exclusive ipse dixit for their
peculiar benefit! If a sinless angel from the
mythic realms of innocence and purity could be
obtained to fill the onerous and responsible posi
tion of Minister for Lands, even then should we
hesitate to place in his immaculate and spotless
hands such unbounded and despotic power. But
in the present case we have not to deal witli an
angel of light ! We must not forget that it is Mr.
Garrett who claims this autocratic authority
—a man denounced by his present political chief
with a stinging indictment in which his (Mr. Gar-
rett’s) retention in the House of Representatives
was described as a “red-hot, burning brand of
shame ” stamped on the forehead of this fair land;
and his possession of a seat was characterised as a
disgrace and a menace to the purity of public life
iu N. S. Wales. This stigma has never been,
retracted, has never been apologised for. Mr
Garrett, however, now sits in that House to
which his presence was denounced erstwhile as a
disgrace; he holds office in the Ministry of his
accuser; he draws a salary beneath the sanctified
icgis of his pitiless and brutal foe; he sits cheek by
jowl with another bitter defender of public
morality who found him guilty, and who, too, has
neither effaced his judgment nor apologised to the
judge. The outraged House by a special vote has
refused to expunge the scathing words from the
records of its proceedings, and Mr. Garrett is
under the permanent cloud of disgrace which must
ever hover over the head of one whose own
colleagues have publicly testified to their disbelief
iu Ids political honesty. And they have never
taken back their charge, or palliated it by a single
word of remorse or sentiment. This power now
claimed by Mr, Garrett would be a terrific
weapon to place in the hands of a man as pure as
Aristides ; under the circumstances to pass into law
the 18th clause of the Land Bill now before the
House would be an act of legislative suicide and
national disgrace.
Frce(i*a«|e England,
The following wholesale indictment of the. pre-
sent Governmental policy of Great Britain must
be particularly interesting to the Foreign-trade
journals of Sydney. The Weekly Bulletin
(a paper the editor whereof tells us that it was so
named as a compliment to the success of the
Sydney Bulletin) thus sums up the present con
dition of Freetrade England
“ Our lane) is fast going out of cultivation, and the
beggars in our big' cities are increasing by thousands.
Our workhouses (town ones—the country ones haw
mostly sent their tenants to headquarter) are so full that
extra" accommodation is everywhere a necessity. Our
agriculture has practically ceased or is ceasing, although
our importations of cattle, of meat, of flour, or of grain ar e
yearly increasing. We import eggs by the hundreds of mil-
lions,"and English cheese and English butter are becoming
so rare that specimens will soon be on exhibit in the dif-
ferent museums. We import our furniture and our beer,
our metals and our wood ; even our garden produce and
our apples or fruit—tinned mostly, at that. We buy pre,
served fruits, whilst we allow our plums and strawberries
to wither away upon the trees or plants. Several lines of
steamers now "run regularly from the ports of .Japan and
China, laden with wares of every description made
hy the inhabitants of those countries. We am
nually buy from them hundreds of thousands of
pounds’ worth of lacquered goods, of carpets,
rugs, tea-services, trays, or slippers, ornamental
crockery, curtains, wicker-work, screens, embroider}’, &c.
We have in London many shops which sell scarcely anything
else but these things. Our own trades are fast leaving ns.
Our artizans prefer America, Germany, or France, where
they can put the profits they make into their own pockets
instead of being mulcted for a Government whose short-
comings they are daily learning to loathe. We use foreign
watches, foreign tools, and foreign machinery. Only a
day or two ago we saw carts painted the ‘ Belgian Coal
Company' 1 in the streets of London I”

Why Oiiffierlu Resigned.
Dufferin's resignation of the Indian Governor,
ship is assigned, in the daily press, to the depre
elation of silver and the consequent reduction of
his salary from £20,000 to £12,500. This is non
sense. Due fee in knew the exact amount of his
salary before he took the post, but he did not
know —or at any rate did not realise the pitiless
Ixmdage of the Indians and the appalling ruin
which the British high-toned Civil service and
army officials are working on the wretched people.
He held office about as Jong as Ripon, and re-
signed for the same cause. Ripon in his Ilbert
Bill attempted to give the Indians this petty
modicum of Home Rule—that such as were
qualified by wealth and special study to pass into
tlie Civil service might do so and hold the office
of magistrate. Russia has granted thrice as much
to every eastern nation she nas conquered. Alik-
hanoff, the conqueror of Bokhara, was once simple
Ali Khan, Armenians have risen to the highest
posts, not excluding the Chancellorship of the
Empire. Ripon resigned because he found the
British gentlemen of the two services were in open
rebellion agains,t him to a man, arq ; the merchants
with them. Once the Indian cities were full of
native artisans. Now every native industry is
crushed out of existence by the /i°) v of Freetrade,
cheap Brummagem import “imitations” which
have enriched the holy Englisl ll monopolist manu-
facturers, like John Bright t d Joseph Cham-
berlain, and their Calico-Jp ,n y agents. The
army and the Civil service ' 1 re v’ a °t as their
“ police.” Bufferin' had < a }*: this in Ireland,
and lie had seen the conv> e P Protectionist


Canada, and he couldn’t stand it. And this is
the sort of thing D alley and the Imperial Federa-
tionists want in Australia.

Freetrade in Print.
Rays Salmon’s Printing Trades Circular-(Lon-
don), dated January, 1888 ;
“ We have Just had brought under our notice a case of
extreme Gutting* in Httto. work. A firm asked for tenders
tor 250,000 oval labels for beer-bottles. They were to be
ib two colours, stamped, packed, and delivered. An
Englishman offered to take the order at Is. per 1000. He
was told that he was preposterously high—the firm has
before only paid BJd. per 1000 to a German house, and
now that has been" beaten by' another German, who has
agreed to deliver the labels at 6kl. per 1000. The neces-
saries of life ought to be cheap in Germany.”
Freetrade means free competition. Free inter-
national competition among master-printers
means free competition among journeymen
printers. And that ultimately means the desper-
ately necessitous working printer biting his
brother's larynx out in the struggle for the mere
right to live. The fight is hard enough, heaven
knows, between master and man and between
workman and workman when they all live in one
land and under as equal conditions as are
conceivable in the present state of society
but when it comes to the German fighting the
Englishman at every point on the Englishman’s
own ground, while poor John Bull has his hands
tied and is shut out of the German market, it
js .easy to see how the contest must end. It is
(blasphemy to argue against the sacred doctrine of
Fyeetrade— “Christ himself”—a writer was
allowed to say in a letter published with sweet
approval the other day by one of the Sydney
dailies, “ was a Freetrader, and would have
looked with loathing on the iniquitous doctrines
of Protection.” That being so we had better re-
gard the question as settled, and say no more
about it, as it is ungentlemanly to argue against
a man’s religious belief. Let us, therefore, bow
our heads in silence to the Chinaman, who might
just as well, so far as we are concerned, com-
pete with us by shipping his slave-wage
goods to this country as by working in our
midst. The only possible difference in any case
can be this: that the Chinaman who comes
to Australia and works, gets a portion of
the results of his own labour after he has finished
his term of slavery with his yellow boss, while if
he works in China for a boss who ships goods to
Australia the boss gets all the money and John
only a drink of water and two penn’orth of rice a
week. “ The employer naturally feels that so
long as he is plentifully supplied with immigrant
labour—or its results in the shape of cheap im-
ported goods —there is no reason why he shouldn’t
be deaf to the demands of the British workman. ”
An English paper applies this to the German in-
vasion of Great Britain. Australia can apply it
to the Chinese invasion of its own territory.
Jordan, the Queensland Minister for Lands,
makes a few observations :
“ Recurring to the subject of wheat-growing, he said it
cost Queensland something like £500,000 a year in hard
cash for flour. This was sent out of the country to buy-
bread, and another £600,000 for other farm produce Any
Government which did not determine to put a stop to
such a state of things as speedily as possible Would not
be worthy of the confidence of the electors. The £500,000
gent away for flour and grain meant about 2,000,000
bushels of wheat. Twenty bushels to the acre would give
100.000 acres in cultivation. With that additional mimbei
of acres under wheat, we should want about 400,000 acres
in fanning occupation. That divided into eighty-acre
farms would mean 5000 farmers, and calculating* their
families at five each would mean 25,000 more people
settled on the land. As every soul paid £3 per head in
Custom duties, the revenue would be increased by £75,000
per year from Customs alone, and that was nothing in
comparison to the value of the labour which would arise
from not sending this half-million away for flour.”
It is just possible, of course, that Puls ford, of
the New South Wales Freetrade League, can ex-
plain this away; we merely bring it under his
sleepless eye for consideration. As likely as not
he will be able to show how, with £1,000,000 a
year going out for farm-produce, and 5000 farmers
loafing round Brisbane with nothing to do, and
10.000 men bunting rabbits on 40,000 acres of
bush, and the extra £75,000 a year not coming in
by way of customs duties, the country is really
better off than it would be otherwise, and, per-
haps, even more so than could be expected, and
that the only real danger is that people may get
sunstroke while running to put their cash in the
bank. We simply invite his attention to Jordan’s
figures and ask him to construct a diagram brist-
ling with X and Z and let us see how the thing is
done. We are thirsting after knowledge and
hungering for facts about the political economy of
having nothing to do, and if Puls ford can’t
supply them who in all creation can ?
In the New South Wales Assembly last week
Treasurer Burns made a hideous effort to explain
away the half-million deficit in the accounts for
the first quarter of 1888, and having deliberately
knocked off £BOO,OOO from for the
three months he produced a paper surplus of
£300,000. From this his admirers gathered that
there will probably be £1,200,000 to the good at
the close of the year, and there is much jubilation
in the Foreign Trade camp. The £BOO,OOO in
question was struck off on general principles, the
reason assigned being that “it was not properly
chargeable to the past quarter.” Unfortunately,
however, the one bald fact remains that the money
has been spent. Part of it was “ properly charge-
able ” to last year’s account, but as it was not paid
last year it becomes necessary to provide for it
this year, or for the colony to go insolvent. Part
of it was also chargeable to the ensuing
quarter, but as the ensuing quarter will
probably be swamped with items which should
have been debited to the quarter just closed, and
with other items held over from 1887, there is
very small comfort to be derived from Mr. Burns’
assurances under this head. For many years past
there has been an average sum of £250,000 per
quarter to be paid on account of liabilities incurred
in preceding years, and when the national Micaw-
BER airily brushes aside more than one-third of
the quarter’s expenditure on the ground that it
should not properly be charged to that particular
Eeriod, the question naturally arises—what does
e propose to charge it to ? If part of it belonged
to 1887, why did he not pay it in 1887, instead
of holding it over in the endeavour to
produce a sham surplus, and what guarantee has
the nation that he is not holding over a similar
balance to be paid in 1888? Mr. Burns’ alleged
surplus of £300,000 cannot stand against the one
irrefutable fact that New South Wales has paid
away in three months half-a-million more than
she has received. Why she did it is a matter of
small account. The world is full of astute people
who are prepared to argue with a corpse and
prove to it by figures that it is not dead, but
somehow the proof is of very little practical ac-
count. The corpse goes on being dead just the
same.

846. Macquarie-street North, Sydney, April 18, 1888.
.My Dear Moorabixda,— ln the first place let me tell you
that that very handsome, not to say voluptuous-lookin
hospital-nurse, whose massive charms have made her the
envy of the women and the idol of more men than one
could count on all one’s fingers and toes, is at last going
be married. And to whom do you think ? To one of
Australia’s richest squatters, a venerable bachelor whose
cheque for £lOO,OOO would be honoured by any hank.
Notwithstanding the swain’s age she must be accounted a
lucky woman, for, my dear, I take it that she might just
as well nurse one man as a dozen.
And while I am on the subject of nursing, you will be
delighted to hear that that most charming of all talkers,
Mr. Dailey, whose little fish-dinners—how people do love
his divine cook’s oyster-patAs ! —are the greatest of Aus-
tralian culinary triumphs, is again well enough to write
letters—and physic-puffs ! He attributes the • vast im-
provement in his health to the persistent use of a certain
well-advertised “ safe ” patent medicine. The story goes
that the doctors had given his case up as hopeless, and
that their patient, on being* told of this, seemed to be
rapidly sinking ; whereupon a lady of much resource who
is attached to Mr. Dailey’s household bounced the
medicos out of the establishment and prescribed on her
own account for the invalid, bottle after bottle of the
remedy in question. The patent-medicine people are, of
course, jubilant, andare, naturally enough, making the very-
best use of the circumstance, but the doctors, when spoken
to about the matter, merely shrug* their shoulders and re-
mark that anybody who can thus he cured must be as
much a victim of hypochondria as of anything* else. For
myself, my dear, I believe these things are all matters of
bright smiles and careful nursing, and that at least as
much depends upon who pours out a sick man’s medicine
as upon what the medicine-bottle contains.
The other day I read a funny little item written by a
lady to a Sydney paper“ Emperor Fritz’s principal
nurse is an Irish ‘sister.’ The Empress rarely leaves the
room.” I am much afraid that my sister of the quill must
herself be an Irish lady.
1 wonder what fresh atrocity the more foolish of the
members of our sex will next commit in the matter of
dress ! As you know, it is now the fashion to wear in the
street loose-fitting jackets, d la Garibaldi, with a skirt of
different colour. Of all the frights I have ever seen the
greatest was a very well-known girl, who last week “ did
the-Block” in a loose-fitting white jacket with puffed
sleeves and a tight black skirt. Her figure, not to use too
cruel a word, is at the best of times very* attenuated
looking, so just imagine the effect she managed to pro
duoe by thus making* the upper part of her body seem
very very fat and the lower part even thinner and more
pipey and more kangaroo-like than ever ! Tam far from
disliking costumes of this sort when they are worn by-
people who can carry them off, though I must really con-
fess that the effect produced by' the sharp contrast be-
tween a dark skirt and a light jacket, or vice versa, was at
first rather startling*. It looked as if .the girl who had
assumed it had forgotten to fully' dress herself before
leaving her room. lam sure this was the general mascu-
line verdict, for at the gate of a house in Woollahra, the
other evening, one girl so attired said to another that
“she thought it was time to go to bed.” “Yes,” said
wicked little hoy T , who had seemingly never before seer,
such a dress, “but you’d better wait till you get home,
lady. Don’t take off any more of y r er clothes here,
please.”
You asked me the other day who Lord and Lady—l
think I had better say Lo.rd and Lady De Brown-Browne,
now on a visit to Australia, are. Well, lam now told on
very good authority that her ladyship was, only a year or
two age, a dark-eyed, graceful sylph known to the
mashers as Miss C , and that, at various times, she
dispensed fiery and other liquids at an Adelaide hotel and
at the Bijou Theatre and other places in Melbourne. My
informant, who is a man, say's he is not sufficiently ac
quainted with the peerage to tell me anything about her
lord, but he adds that if he is half as good in his way as
he is in hers, he must be a cut above ordinary sprigs of
nobility'. How barmaids do fascinate men ! I suppose it
is because wine and woman when allied are irresistible.
Hebe is certainly the hHe noir of us women—all the more
so because we rarely have a chance of gratifying our
curiosity by watching her at work. The unknown Is
always very terrible.
I was glancing over one of the morning papers when
my eye lighted on a long letter on the subject of flowers.
It was a gushing epistle, and in the last paragraph the
author expressed a desire to foster “ a love for these pretty
and sweet and dear gifts of the Creator.” Then I said to
myself that the writer was a woman—none but a woman,
as a rule, can pile up these nicey-nicey little adjectives—
and I added mentally that this woman was a duck. I
confess it was a shock when I ascertained that a clergy-
man had done it. I don’t know this particular one,
but I ventured to draw a mental picture of him right off,
and if he isn’t a roley-poley little shepherd 1 am further
astray than I ever was before.
Barbarism isn’t yet quite extinct. I was passing the
door of a Sy'dney jeweller’s shop the other evening* when
I was attracted by a faint scream from a lady inside, and,
looking in, I saw a patient sitting* in a chair in full view
of everybody who went by. She was getting her oars
pierced. The jeweller had a firm hold of one of her
organis of hearing—it made quite a good handful, by the
way* —and was driving a needle through it, while she shed
tears, and held herself down in a chair, and devoutly
wished that it was all over. She was young—say about
20—and tolerably good-looking, and she was accompanied
by an elderly relative with six grey curls, who tittered
over the proceedings, while a little crowd outside guf-
fawed. The victim didn’t wait to have her nose bored,
though she might as well have done so while the job was
in progress. I would —just to show the crowd outside
that I didn’t care—well, a bit.
The very latest invention of fashion for the benefit
of womankind is a handkerchief with a little buttonhole
in the centre, through which a powder-puff is attached.
No more dropping this so necessary contrivance of com-
fort and beautification ; no further necessity' for searching
pockets and reticules, no anxious waiting for opportune
moments. It will always he ready—a trusty friend, in-
deed. And what a lot of grateful patrons the contrivance
will have in Collins-street !
You have, perhaps, not heard of the very latest slips of
our own Mrs. Malaprop. She says she likes old china,
and that she gets her taste tor it from her poor
father, \\ ho simply doted on iniquities. And in recom-
mending* the attention of a friend of hers to a particular
dish at table, a little while ag*o, Mrs. M. said, “ You really
must try it. I assure you it is quite rechauffe.” How-
ever, I believe these stories to be mere inventions, as the
poor woman surely can’t always be saying good things by
mistake.
1 hear, on excellent authority, that the aides-de-camp
to colonial governors are never happy until the “old
gentlemen ” have gone to bed. Mr. , who used to
be A.D.C. in New Zealand years ago, once told me that,
so far as his experience went, aides-de-camp and private
secretaries were often treated only as upper servants.
Ml *. used to be private secretary, and old Sir
used t( > actually make him light his bedroom
candle when the time for.retiring had arrived.
How rude are some of the occupants of Sydney theatri-
cal boxes ! For instance, when Leonora Braham and the
two other little maids from school came tripping on the
stage, hand-in-hand, during the recent “.Mikado” run at
the Sydney Loyal, a dreadful person threw a superb
oouquet indiscriminately at the trio. As none of the
three little maidens possessed presumption enough to
claim it, for herself it had to lie gently moved behind the
scenes by gradual and delicate application of the too of
one of the male actors’ boots. But don’t you think the
time has arrived for abolishing for ever the 'custom of
oouquet-throwing, which, as at present conducted, in 00
cases out of a hundred only serves to interrupt the per-
formance ?
A friend of mine, the other day, gave me, as her idea of
absolute happiness to live in a good climate —to have lots
of lovely dresses—-and to own a husband who wouldn’t
beat her. 1. really believe that this is often just about a
girl’s idea of perfect bliss. Throw in a hopelessly zealous
female ‘ friend, a pug-dog, and an introduction to a
popular actor, and many a Sydney girl will not require a
heaven. By-the-way, one “ popular acto *,” about whom
1 have heard hundreds of girls rave, is a married man,
with a daughter quite flve-and-tvventy. However, his
daughter isn t here, and he shaves his face clean. So long*
as a man displays plenty of “cheek ” it doesn’t seem
much to concern women whether he is young or not.
Somebody once said that nothing* was ever lost by
politeness. I red, who, as you happen to know is most
polite, tells me that during the last three months he has
gi\ en his seat in the tram-car to a dozen or more women
and girls—pretty girls, ugly girls, shop girls, ballet girls,
tobacco-factory girls, young women, washerwomen, old
women, women wearing golden hair and diamond lockets,
and our sex in general. They were all grateful to him’
one poor old soul gave him a sour apple ; several held his
umbrella and bag while he stood ; and yet another told
him what to take to get rid of influenza.
A well-known Sydney lady, en mute by the Ormuz for
Italy, writes me a marvellous letter from Adelaide, in
which she dwells chiefly upon the subject of -her appetite!
She tells me that so invigorated is she by the sea air that
she is actually absorbing seven meals a day I ! lam glad
she isn’t going* to ’Frisco.* After such dieting she could
never manage to get through the Golden Gate.
A very good story I heard about a youthful curate of a
certain church, who was acquainted with a young* lady
for several years, and merely greeted her as tepidly as he
did everyone else. By-and-bye an old and unknown relative
of hers died and left her mistress of a considerable fortune.
The curate then suddenly became aware that his whole
being was aflame with Love, chaste, unworldly love, for
her, and her only, and off he* started on matrimony
bent. Having ,a “duck of a moustache” and long-
legs, of course he, succeeded, and she became his affianced.
Desiring to breathe theiiewstohis parishioners, he attended
an afternoon tea, where there was a crowded house, and,
as he was handed his Bohea, he said, oilily; “Aw-did
you know Miss Mary is engaged?” “No,” snapped the
vieille terrible of the suburb ; “ some fortune-hunter, I
suppose, after the poor girl’s money!” Such a facer
would have utterly routed anybody who was not
thoroughly Good—with a big, big G—but the pious
young saint was equal to her. “ Not on this occa-
sion,” ho said sweetly and triumphantly, “ for the flanede
is—myself ! ” Nobody dares to question his motives now,
and the wedding preparations are rapidly going forward.
The above curate's flock have a firm nineteenth-century
grip of the beauties of faith. They recently gave £2
for a monogram for their altar-cloth and £2 7s. fid. for the
relief of the poor and suffering. This left the halt 7s. 6d.
ahead of the altar-cloth, and so no one can accuse them
of neglecting flesh and blood in favour of gold-thread and
plush !
The fashionable girl of this winter will find it unhealthy
to cross a paddock where a bovine specimen happens to
browse, for red—glaring, butchcr’s-shbp red—is to be “ the
go.” This is the last, worst, and most awful of all the
Jubilee inflictions, and it seems to stick closer than a
brother to us. On Saturday a Sydney fashionable came
out iii it from head to heel—her hat being fearfully and
wonderfully made of Ted velvet with a huge bunch of
cock’s-red feathers at the side ! She looked murderous
and martial, and, as she swished down Hunter-street,
somebody softly whistled a bar of the “Boulanger”
march. Some of the winter novelties are quite nice this
year, though. The “ Fedora ” boa, which has a little hag-
muff cunningly attached in front, is particularly fetching,
especially to those whom fur becomes.
As everybody knows, a certain up-country Croesus is
virtually separated from his wife —he residing* in England,
she (just now) at one of the Points. The trouble came
about in this way. She liked the society of handsome
men. Hubby became jealous—objected—and remained
semi-volcanic until one evening, when he announced over
the dinner table (where two or three cavaliers were ab-
sorbing the attention of His better-half) that he was going
to Melbourne for a week. “Must you?” said the lady,
plaintively ; “oh ! don’t go.” And then she made a side-
.grimace to the handsomest dude. That grimace cost her
her husband, who has never lived under the same roof
with her since.
The gaitered Primate was at home last Saturday to any
Episcopalian sheep who had decent wool and the price of
a cab about him. The afternoon being* Weak, Bishops-
court (with which our spiritual leader is much dissatis-
fied) was colder than a parvenu’s nod to a former crony,
and very few notables showed up.
The Raster encampment has faded into the remote, and
we have bidden a regretful farewell to those impromptu
little four-o’clock teas iu the snowy tents of the gallant
officers. What a charming time we had! A smart ride to
the encampment—a rest iu the grateful shade of canvas—
and some of the most agreeable men in Sydney to hand
one one’s tea and to flirt with one! Some people found
those visits too agreeable perhaps. I know for a positive
fact that one family visited the encamped seven times!
But, never mind ! No officer, so far as I have heard, is
hkely to he drummed out on this occasion for introducing
his wife somebody who wasn’t.
Vice-regal “ Sophia,” last Thursday, was a frost for
those who like to speculate on Lady Carington’s dress.
Her Ladyship was not present, and the pretty comedy'
eventuated in the light of U.K.’s unaided smile. The house,
course, was a bumper, and the stage-boxes were well
patronised. The manager’s box held a party of four. A
popular Sydney citizen and his amiable wife, iu rich
black lace and jet, and two visitors front Maoriland, one
of whom, in white silk and pearl and diamond ornnmenti
iu her blonde hail- and at her throat and arms, looked
pretty enough to eat. New Zealand women run awav
from the Sydneyites pour le regard. It’s their bright
colour does it.
Some lucky people, belonging to our first families, went
“ home ” from Sydney the other day. They have stayed
out here quite a long time because 'they didn’t think their
income sufficient to make a splash with in London. They
draw from their N.S.W. proper!y over £70,00(1 a year '
One, of the newest things in hall gowns is the poppy
f less. The whole front of the robe is covered with enor
mous petals, several times larger than in nature, made of
the thinnest silk, and crinkled to imitate the flower.
Monotony is broken by interspersing the petals with here
and there poppy seed-balls hanging down upon long, soft
stalks.
One of the prettiest social sights of Sydney now, clear, is
the nicely bartered author of a badly-barhered plav, who
may be seen any time during exhibition hours, seated on
a violet velvet throne, his pale forefinger upon his pallid
brow, gazing mystically into farness while receiving the
adoration of beauteous women. Another pretty “social
show is that afforded by a well-known masher who plays
the part of tame cat to an equally well-known married
“society” woman, and who sits stock still in the theatre
for three solid hours, and never once leaves off sucking
his stick allthe time.
1 wonder how Sir Henry Loch now feels about the hand-
some Mrs. Gordon-Baillie, two of whose pretty children
he once ostentatiously nursed at a public concert in Mel-
bourne? But how soft all men are ! How soft with re-
spect to this very same dashing Mrs. Gordon-Baillie, were
a well-known Macquarie-street doctor—and bachelor
*-’ > an( l bachelor D , and widower B— I and all
the rest of them, from old imbecile Sir Richard Buck-
worth King, who used to sit and drivel in a corner of her
splendid London drawing-room while he was spending’ his
thousands upon her, down to the gilded swell who, when
she was in Sydney, supplied her with horses and rolling-
stock ! There are, in Australia, many people who knew
her in London ; for a year or two prior to her advent hero
she quite haunted the agencies of the various Australian
papers, in quest of bold advertisement. She used to live
in Bryanston-street, next to Mr. Broadley, the barrister
who defended Arabi Pasha.
The harp is rapidly displacing the piano in Melbourne,

And now, just as I write good bye, let me tell you that
you have to congratulate Sydney on the approaching de-
parture of its chief social pestilence, the hulking* person-
age who for years has glared like a wild beast at every
jnetty woman whom he met in town. He is going to
where he will have plenty of women to glare at. How
popular he will be to-he sure ! Yours affectionatelv

The Argus, with smug complacency, echoes
Charles Kingsley’s babble about the predestined
settlement of Australia. Thus snuffles the two-
penny organ : —“ In the wisdom of Providence
this isolated and unique continent, remote from
the centres of population and from the sounds of
their strife, with many advantages and few
drawbacks, has been reserved for the British race.
No other people has received such a gift. And
the question is, What will we do with it ? ” What
a solemn question for our consideration, dear
friends! Providence might have given this con-
tinent to the Rooshians or the Prooshians, or the
I-talians ; but the gift was set apart for the
blessed British race, by the grace of Captain
Cook. _ And what did we commence to do with it,
dear friends ? We first utilised it as a “ convict-
tip,’ and then we allowed a handful of squatters
to grab the best part of Heaven’s unique blessing
for themselves. Then Providence began to get
full up of the British race, and reserved the Kew
Hebrides for the French and half of New Guinea
(a most thoughtful arrangement of Providence
that!) for the Germans. And if we don’t keep a
smart look out Providence will transfer the whole
bag of tricks to the slant-eyed leper.
Why has the New South Wales Attorney-
General refrained from taking proceedings fin-
forgery, or false pretences, or perjury, on
one side or the other, in the matter of the
case Pom baht v. Australian! Banking Company,
Limited ? During the hearing of that case it was
deposed that some official of the politician-bossed
pawnshop in question had obtained two guineas
from the plaintiff, Pombart, by affixing to a bill
of sale a stamp (subsequently erased) purport-
ing to be that of Mr. J. M. Curtis, solicitor, of
Sydney—who then got into the box and swore
that the document had never come through his
office, that he had never been paid any money on
account of it, that he had never authorised any-
body to use a stamp on his behalf, and that he
was utterly unaware of the existence of the
stamp in question until he was subpoenaed in
connection with the case. And if the Attorney-
General so grossly neglects his duty as chief
public _ prosecutor as to allow a colossal scan-
dal with which the name of his colleague,
Abigail, the Minister of Mines (a director of the
“ bank ” aforesaid) is connected in a secondary
way, to remain uninvestigated, may we be per-
mitted to inquire what the Law Institute of New
South Wales mean to do in the matter ? The
affair is a very simple one, and needs treatment
with a knife.

The Lite Judge Fellows, Victoria, when
at the bar, was generally supposed to hold in
Contempt the minor courts or “ courts below.”
The present Judge Quinlan, whose practice prin-
cipally lay itl the “courtsbelow,’’once appeared ih
the Supreme Court to prosecute an appeal from
the County Court, and, in opening, said ; “That
there had been a very learned argument in the
court below over the case.” Fellows, who
happened to be in a surly mood that morning, in-
terjected with a loud laugh : “ A learned argu-
ment ! Think of a learned argument before
Judge Cope! ”

The other day a

which the public rushed

less, and has now made
out of it £50,000! What

James Stewart Johnston,
who, in the early forties,
kept an hotel in Mel-

the trustees of the Mel-

the Hon. Joseph T< ik - -
who, by the way, matri-.

“Lady Brassey,” says a London paper,
“ made a special request before her death to her
daughter, the Hon. Mabelle Brassey, that when
she was married—as she is to, be shortly, to Mr.
G. A. Egerton—she would obtain the whole of
her trousseau from, the Donegal Industrial Fund,

Sydney D.T. claims for N.S.W. proud
pre-eminence' in sculling, cycling, cricket, foot-
runnhig, turf-winners, jockeys, sailing, swimming,
and boxing 1 , iii each of which departments of
sport she holds' the championship of Australia.
This is very good, but, by the way, N.S.W. has
also the champion “red : hot burning, brand, of
shame, ” the champion usurer in high places, the
champion insolvent in high places, the champion
tippler in high places, the champion shallower of
little gjrls round dark corners, and she also , takes,
the cake for drunkenness, ignorance, the hanging
of boys of tender’years, disgraced solicitors, sus-
pended officials, ferocious judges, stupid juries,
corrupt police, fighting politicians, religious rene-
gades' who make political capital out of their
apostacy, sensational.parsons on land-jobs, a pan-
dering press, and a looney Governor,
The Patriot Ah Haynes.
The other day The Bulletin pointed out the
intense parochialism of the Australian Natives’ As-
sociation, a “National” organisation which
excluded from its ranks Australians born
in old-world lands. Thereupon a little clique
of discredited political job-grubbers and rouse-
about demagogues now pretend to recognise
this, and, headed by Mudgee Haynes, they
loudly denounce the “contracted provin-
cialism of the Victorian Purvks’ proposal.”
They announce themselves per medium of the
little man from Cork to be adverse to the resolu-
tions submitted by the Victorian deputation at
the recent Sydney meeting, “it being the
opinion of those identified with the present move-
ment that the idea of an exclusive Australian
Natives’ Association is small and unworthy of
support.” They consider that it “perpetuates
racial distinctions,” that it is “ unjust to men not
Australian-born, who founded the Australian em-
pire ” —these men, after all, are only Imperialists
—“ and help now to give it character and strength
before the world,” and, finally, that “ the cultiva :
tion of an Australian sentiment must be attempted
on a wide, statesmanlike basis.” After reading this
generous and far-reaching statement of principles
yoll might think that the present movement
really had a broad basis. But not so. The last
sentence cooks its goose entirely. The real fact
is that the present stump-orators desire to
hiake it a “ .Sydney-side ” movement, and are too
narrow-minded and too jealous to take a hint
from another coldny. This sentence kills com-
pletely all their liberalism :
“ The speakers, whose names will be Hilly ahnounced,
ivili be all Australian horn, and the chair thill be taken
by an Australian."
But, apart from this, it is sufficient for Young
Australia to know that the greatest political
shuffler who ever stepped in shoe-leather is the
presiding Mephistopheles in this movement, to
shun it. He is a noxious wriggler, who shame-
lessly makes political capital out of his religious
apostacy —he has on every possible public ques-

tion, except one, turned and twisted, squirmed,
and bounced, and grovelled. He ran a paper to
support Jennings and abuse Parkes, and started
with Dibbs as a deity, only to drag his idol
in the mud when he could no longer secure adver-
tisements through the use of its Shibboleth. The
unutterable degradation of his position can be
faintly appreciated when it is remembered that
when Parkes the man whom Haynes had
formerly ridiculed and traduced —told Mudge£, in
scalding and scathing, terms of contempt
and disgust, that he (Parkes) “ wanted neither
Mr. Haynes; support in the House nor his ac-
quaintance outside of it,” this new champion of
Australian Nationalism dropped down on his pitiful
knees and fawned and cringed and frantically
hung on to Parkes’ tattered political robe. And
this is the man who, with his confederate Down-
ing, another hireling bummer of the York-street
shoddymongers, aspires to lead Young Australia !
At latest advices, 170 Protectionists and ten
Foreign-traders were in the field in Queensland.
The North is a live country, and has made up its
mind not to settle down into the petrified, grass-
grown state of premature old age which is the dis-
tinguishing brand of New South Wales. It wants
to lay the foundations of future prosperity—not
the artificial prosperity whiqh comes of big loans
expended on unprofitable railways in order, to
keep the population from mutiny, and which col-
lapses like a house of cards when the last loan is
spent and only the interest remains, but the pros-
perity of a country which has biiilt up manufac-
tures and developed its, internal fesourqes, and is
no longer dependent on the outside world for the
necessaries of existence. In a land where, such a
sentiment prevails there is.no room for a Foreign-
trade faction; and, consequently,' both of - the
political leaders have gone for Protection. The
attempt to build up a third party for
the purpose of running Queensland in the
interests of the large Brisbane importers
has broken down miserably, and the eternal
Terewth as expounded by the greedy ring of Man-
chester is supported by only ten forlorn and
hooted candidates whose alleged principles are an
object of derision throughout the colony. After
the Queensland election New South Wales will
stand alone amid the States of Australasia—the
solitary supporter of a bowled-out faith—a land
which is dying that the German and Chinaman
may live and when the dissolution of her exist-
ing Parliament sends Parkes into private life,
there to live on the interest of a public charity,
she also will go for Protection, and the foreign
manufacturers who have so long lived upon Aus-
tralia must look for other worlds to exploit.
A Song of Protection
IMPORTED, YOU KNOW.
(With Apologies to N.Y. LIFE.)
Oh, why is the Artglo-Australian proud ?
His style is imported, you know.
But why is his manner irisuff’rably loud ?
That’s also imported, you know.
With “ Lunnun-made” raiment lie cuts a great
dash ;
For everything “ Hinglish ” he shells oitt his cash ;
No matter the value, to him all is trash
That is not imported, you know.
His wines and cigars are the best to be had
They’re freshly imported, you know.
He makes it a point to adopt the last “fail ”
That has been imported, you know.
With a little round window stuck into his eye,
He ogles humanity as from on high.
An asinine figure to cut he doth try—
The notion’s imported, you know.
It makes a plain Cornstalk excessively tired,
To see things imported, you know ;
Placed up on a pedestal to be admired,
Because they’re imported, you know.
And this Anglomaniac with his odd ways,
Who spends time and Wealth on some imported
craze,
Assuredly should, for the rest of his days,
Be quickly exported, you know.
The Land of Goschen—-the British Isles.
Mr. Haynes has not been editing the
Evening News quite so much this week.
A Queensland paper says This is the
year when the girls leap.” Not so. It is the year
when the girls are fly.
Why is the N.S.W. State House Bill like
the letter “ H,” as manipulated by ’Enery
Parkes ? Because intelligent people don’t like it
in (H)Australia, and Sir ’Enery is sure to drop it
in the ’Ouse very soon.
An alleged golden venture in the Armidale
(N.S.W.) district is known as the “Warm Corner
Mine.” Three parts of the gold-mines in N.S.
Wales have a good case against the owners of that
claim for pirating their just title.
Groom, the notorious Queensland As-
sembly Speaker, has a clear gift of the gab, but
he talks of his own and other people’s “ ’ands and
’earts,” and his wrath over the Land Grant Rail-
way Hact is thoroughly Parkesian.
The testamentary arrangements of Mr.
Ben. Hepburn, a Ballarat sporting identity, are
regarded as somewhat peculiar. He (so the papers
say) left his wife £5OO and a yearly income of
£7OO, and to Miss M'Kissock, of the Club Hotel,
“a perfect stranger,” he bequeathed just double
that amount.
Nicholas B. Downing (late of Penzance,
England), the N.S.W. Ereetrade spouter, was
neatly cornered by Protectionist Rose at Bathurst,-
the other evening, by means of these questions ;
“ 1. As Freetrade teaches unrestricted competition in
commodities, must it not also teach unrestricted competi-
tion in labour, considering that commodities are the re-
sult of labour? 2. As Trades Unionism is formed for the
purpose of restricting competition in labour, is not
Trades Unionism a violation of the principles of Free-
trade V 3. If high wages need no protection from low
wages, explain why our iron-workers at 11s. per day can-
not make railway locomotives against the F.nglish labour
of 6s. per day ; also why the better-paid Australian labour
cannot compete against the low-paid Chinese labour en-
gaged in cabinet-making ?
Dear Bulletin, —I read in the papers that
last Sunday morning “Archbishop Dunne blessed
the bell of St. Stephen’s R.C. Cathedral at Bris-
bane.” Now, it may interest your Queensland
readers to- know that every Sunday morning I lie
in bed at the Oxford Hotel, Sydney, and curse all
the church bells that ever rang since the founda-
tion of the world. lam a sick and sleepless man,
and the unceasing row of the clergy’s bullock bells
deprive me of my rest. I cannot move away I
am compelled to. stay in, my present otherwise
comfortable quarters, for my doctor, whom I have
constantly to see, lives round the corner. Church-
bells are a relic of barbarism, utterly unadapted
to the high-strung civilisation of the present day,
and should be suppressed. You cannot, however,
expect the parsons to tie up their clappers in
stockings, for the stockings of the priests and
deacons and elders are too full. Nor can you hope
that the clergy will abolish bells, for bells are
part if the machinery, part of the pomp and
circumstance of their trade, just as are black
coats and pious smiles and magnificent churches
wherefrom poor women are dragged if they wil-
fully or ignorantly sit down in the cushioned
front seats instead of humbly taking their places in
the back. In these days, when a striking clock
can be bought for four-and-sixpence and a watch
for five half-crowns, no man or woman who really
wishes to pray needs a savage row to remind
him or her that there is a God. Church-bells don’t
remind people that God exists ; they only serve
to recall the fact that the parson is on the warpath.
And yet the very men who wantonly and callously
deprive me of my hard-earned rest and inflict the
utmpst m|sery morning and night on every sick,
woman or man who happens to be —and who is.
not?—within sound of their cracked lumps of
gun metal, are the people who, prosecute news-
paper-boys for disturbing the Sabbath calm, by
shouting out op Sunday morning ! I don’t;,
believe in the noisy news-vendor, but, being
logical, neither dp. I believe in the holy
cow-bell. Spme of these days we shall have
a level-headed parson who wants to, keep up,
the sensationalism of his show and declare fat
dividends and amass a reserve-fund, putting up a,
steam-foghorn at his tabernacle. 'And why
shouldn’t there be steam-whistles at the churches ?
Is it not merely because the steam T whistle on the.
steeple would he an innovation, whereas the moss
of antiquity ha? grown over the cow-bell ? Yours
truly, Walter Greenwood.

The attendance at Sydney Royal was dis-
hmrred by spots of baldness on the second night of
1 nncess Ida, from which we gather that a
sheep-headed branch of the Aryan family Iras not
fully caught on to the beauties of that opera. The
tun of Princess Ida ”isof a subdued and hidden
descnption, like an elephant’s-breath ball costume
at the bottom of a coal pit, and most of the people
vho saw it on the first night are now lying on
their faces endeavouring to think out the jokes.
.Many of these belong to the smothered order of
architecture, and are not immediately visible
t° a1 ™ e ( n f? d eye of citizens in the lower
a Iks ot .h fe, but the opera appeals strongly
to the intellect of the upper classes, and
I should receive the warmest support from car-
dinals, betting-men, and Broken Hill share-
holders. The story is lovely in its simplicity,
and can be bought from the boy at the door for a
S dung. (Tama, a bandy-legged king, who seems
to have been lifted in the course of some rock-
blastmg experiments in early life, comes over the
lull at the back of the stage to explain to Hilde-
brand, another king—there are slathers of kings in
his opera and princes are as plentiful as gum—that
us daughter has made up her mind to repudiate
the marriage ceremony which was performed over
her at the early age of one, and will see Hilde-
brand s heir-apparent blessed first. The lady it
appears, has shut herself up in a castle surrounded
with cactus, nettles, bull-pups, and broken bottles,
and, along with 100 other girls, she scorns the
object winch is made by nine tailors, and devotes
herself to the study of obscure science. The two
kings roar at each other for awhile after these
facts come out, but ultimately Gama is
shut up on bread and water along with
his three quarrelsome sons, and Hildebrand
publishes a fierce yet grammatical howl for troops.
n the next act a young man disguised as a
woman gets drunk in a ladies’ seminary, and Ida
fads into a brook, out of which she is hauled by
the back hair. Before she has time to dry herself
a quantity of troops get over the wall, and the
I nncess has to hang about, at the risk of rheu-
matism, to argue with them. Ultimately, how-
tSvfr, J gets away and shakes herself and has a
rub-down, and after a considerable display of
military ironmongery the Princess surrenders just
in time for the last tram home.

< amount of dulness disfigures
Princess Ida ” in places, but when the audience
have struggled through the wastes of the first act
a moderately cheering prospect lies before them,
ibe scenery belongs to the gorgeous order, and the
orchestra is of a most satisfactory description. Miss
Hsonora Braham as Ida looks every inch a prin-
cess—not the princess of real life, who is generally
lame, and fat, and haunted by a cold, but the
regal animal as she ought to be. Her voice is in
especially goodjeondition, and the song “I built
o P 'fxi a rock >” is a marvel of plaintive melody,
nut the success of the piece is Miss Aggie Kel-
tons song, “A lady fair of lineage Mgh was
Joyed .by an Ape in the days gone by,” and as she
finished tears of joy trickled down the audience.
Miss A lice Barnett is larger than ever in a rather
unhappy part, and Miss May Pollard helps
he.r in a way that promises well for her
future if she lives long enough. Gama,
a king —who, like a certain viceroy we wot of—
lias space for a wheelbarrow between his leo-s
and is afflicted with a cheese-coloured counten-
ance, is run with a great fund of humour by Mr
Vernon. Mr. Duncan Young is a high-class
'if avion, though the part seems to try his voice
and he looks now and then as if he were swallow-
ing something large; and Mr. Edwin Kelly is a
pretty dull old monarch, who isn’t of very' much
account. Mr. Woodfield is held over for con-
sideration,

Afc Sydney Gaiety the departing D,ampler
»s running a race against Time in the effort to
•'eproduoe a larger number of plays before he goes
man any other Caucasian citizen ever produced
before. On Saturday night his exertions iu this
direction led to the reappearance of Pettitt and
Conquests “ Royal Pardon,” an incoherent drama
m several screams, in which gilded Vice spends
years on a tearing burst of prosperity, while
y irtue is wrecked on a barren coast and has to
dodge gorillas and chimpanzees. The wicked
loan marries the good man’s wife, and flourishes
like a green-bay tree, while the unjustly ac-
cused individual whose public-house used to
stand by the sea-shore in the old happy
idays, is living on clams in a heathen land.
But towards the end the bad man’s pal loses his
pocket-book, and then Nemesis follows. The de-
praved sharebroker is digging a hole with a tall
hat on, and gets locked out, and when he returns
he falls out of a window, leaving behind him the
evidences of his sin tied up iu a red pocket-hand-
kerchief. The “ Royal Pardon’’has since given
place to “ Life in the Goal Pits,” a drama which
includes an Underground explosion and various
other moral influences; and behind this conies
“Othello ’ and other variations on the gamut of
human woe,

“ King’s Congress of Specialists,” who uovv
tufest Sydney Academy, are a crowd who require
to .be seen to be believed—in fact we incline to
think that they require to be seen twice over.
And we are not absolutely sure that they
would be believed even then. The show
commenced on Saturday with the funereal, moss-
grown hat trick —the old, time-crusted, lichen-
covered dodge of our childhood, and when this
was finished the “ Professor ” hid himself behind
a table, and put a cannon-ball in the bell-
topper, which ammunition afterwards dropped
out on to the floor amid screams of sur-
prise from the audience. The hat was reason-
ably suspected of being Manager Hiscocks’ own
orivate chimney-pot, lie being the only individual
yho was seen to enter with a tile of that descrip-
tion. Some awkward fooling with an intelligent
ooy and an umbrella followed. Later on, the
same Professor, as the Fakir of Oolu, exhibited a
ady standing on a stool and propped up with a
ong stick on either side, and, having mesmerised
icr, he took away the stool and one of the sup-
>oris. Consequently she was left floating in the
,ir on one stick. If the Fakir had absent-
iiindedly removed the other stick, the
udience would have seen that the lady
wasn’t attached by any mechanism to the
op of it, and that her sleeve didn’t hang down
/•here it did for the purpose of concealing the con-
nection ; but luckily the man of magic spells re-
adied his presence of mind and saved her an

and is more or less identical with Rigoletto—djut
he is a trifle heavy, and prone to gasp unduly.
Moreover, he is too tall on the leg for this pictur-
esque part; his inches being incompatible with a
hump. Miss Grade Warner, as the jester’s beloved
ewe-lamb stolen from the family fold to feed the
licentious appetite of a naughty Italian lord, acts
prettdy so far as in her lies. The remainder of
the cast wear rich raiment and move amid liberal
surroundings. “ Old Heads and Young Hearts ”
to follow. There has been little merriment about
the brief careers of Alexandra drammers, under
the present management. The first two were loom
in sorrow, with the undertaker shadowing their
early footsteps. But on Saturday, when the
‘•Ring of Iron” was rung in, an attenuated
attendance expressed its satisfaction with an em-
phasis which shed a gleam of hope upon the
proceedings. The “Ring of Iron,” as may be
remembered, is a story of suffering virtue put
into a lunatic asylum, and also contains a
good deal of honest working man, together
with a sawdust baby and other matters. Miss
Blanche Lewis diffuses a lot of Ellen Terry-like
grace and considerable pathos over the female
lead, while Miss Emma Fischer makes a nice
sassiety girl. Augustus Glover villainises in a
robust voice, and the poor but honest business is
woll sustained by Geo. Carey, Harry Taylor, and
Miss May Hill. With liberal scenery and a low
scale of charges this show deserves a leg up. The

ominous name for little Kyrley !
The story of Mrs. Gorion-Baillie’s alleged
adventures is as strange as anything in romance.
If it is true, there surely was never before such a
wonderful washerwoman’s daughter. Whatever
and whoever she may be, Mrs. Gordon Baillie is a
remarkably handsome woman. One who has met
her many times gives the following description of
tal ’ & ood -looking woman, of the type
which the woid elegant seems best to fit. Her
beauty struck me as the beaute du diable , the
eyes being rather sly when not full of any
other expression which circumstances might
call into them at tln moment.' A graceful
figure, claci in a .superbly handsome dress
worthy of Worth at his best, and an midu-
fating grace of movement that might well be con-
sidered fascinating by the susceptible sax—by
whica Ido not mean my own. I confess that t
envied her her dress, a lovely black silk with an
exquisite arabesque design in front from waist to
feet but iier hands were large and thick—one
would have considered them clumsy if the face
and figure had not taken off one’s attention. A
rather large mouth, and a rather earnest expres-
s' 11 also strike me as among my recollections of
Mrs. brordon-Bailhe, who I can well believe
IS a remarkable woman, whether the allega-
tions against her are true or the reverse.
.Her feet were also rather large, so perhaps there
is something in the washerwoman story after all
—not that a woman need be the worse for that
only washerwomen’s daughters are not often dad
as gorgeously as Mrs. Gordon-Baillie wa i as ! re-
member her. Her handwriting was hold and
masculine, but without that indescribable sour-
thing which we call style. lam glad to see that,
at all events, some of her charities were genuine’
and I would willingly believe that although her
career may have been romantic, she is by no
means so black as those allegations paint her.


Pepper
And
Salt
One Sunday last month an old lady in low
circumstances endeavoured to worship the Lord
in St. Mary’s I!.C. Cathedral, Sydney, and was
biffed out by the descendeuts of- St. Peter. .Being-
in an obfuscated state of sin she endeavoured to
adore the penniless Carpenter's Son from one of
the cushioned seats which are reserved for the
golden dustmen of the earth, and she positively-
declined to move when ordered to knock and it
should be opened unto her in one of the cheap
wooden pews at the back of the establishment.
Much powerful exhortation followed from the ap-
prentice-bishop in charge, but the searcher after
Terewth concluded that she would seek regenera-
tion by faith where she was ; and then the Church
got riled and resolved that it would see her
darned before she should regenerate among the
swell brethren, and she was carried forth from
the sanctuary. She hung on to bits of the taber-
nacle as she went, but after much vicious hauling
the toilers in the vineyard got her out in her state
of original sin, and the spirit having thus prevailed
over the flesh she was heaved out of the presence
of the Lord. It was generally concluded that her
conduct in jumping a front seat among the followers
of Him who was poor in Palestine was highly
reprehensible, and notice is hereby given that when
a lady in broken boots wants to find the track to
heaven she should do it without intruding hex-
presence on the saints who wear jewellery and are
able to put on a fresh shirt twice a day. Of such
is the Kingdom of Heaven, Amen.

Bismarck, on bis 73rd birthday, received
greetings from “2000 distinguished personages,
besides many thousands from other people.”
Please observe that the difference, between people
and personages is distinguished :

You can from this assertion gauge ;

But facts are facts, as all,agree—
A “ person ” must distinguished be

And then he is a “ personage.”
Senior-Constable B (we will be
partially merciful), of Melbourne, has sad reason
to bemoan the iroffy of Fate. Dressed in the
jumper and helmet of authority B can run
in, for “insulting behaviour ” the first boy who
sneezes at him. While on duty he makes mad
the guilty and appals the free with a word —a
gesture—a glance. But, off duty, poor B —-
can’t strike terror even to the, gentle soul of Mrs.
I>, The other Sunday, for instance, his wife
threw the joint into the tire, slung a roast chicken
at his head, sent a knife in the same direc-
tion, and then threatened to “stab him
to the heart ” with a carving fork.
Against this particular form of insulting-
behaviour the Wretched senior-constable can
do no more than meekly protest to a magis-
trate, like the very meanest among his subjects.
So great, and yet so little—it is a cruel situation
for B . On the one hand, strong men trem-
bling at his frown ; on the other, a scornful female
1 humping him with a fowl. And he has made all
his property over to her, by the way. Don’t let
us be too severe on police arrogance. Many a
constable who takes it out of an inoffensive
citizen with his truncheon is smarting under a
deep sense of domestic wrong. The missus, per-
chance, has just been stirring up his angry pas-
sions with a carving fork.

All the great circus of cranks is now con-
verging upon Sydney with a view to collecting
Minister Abigail’s official £25,000 reward for the
extinction of the “rabit.” Abigail himself is
snowed-up with letters from people who enclose a
new patent club for dashing the animal’s brains
out, and want a cheque payable to bearer by re-
turn, and when he comes to the surface to breathe
lie is met by gentlemen with contrivances for
stinking the rodent out, or for luring it away so
far from home that it can’t get back again, or for
« wing it to death, or otherwise discouraging it.
Among the crowd "f people who have shoved
Abigail up into a corner, and then talked him into
premature old age, is an exciting specialist named
Taylor, who carries with him a bloodthirsty dust
which remorselessly slays any rodent that chances
to sit down on it. The process is said to be re-
liable and awful in its .suddenness. At one
moment the rabbit is bounding joyously over the
works of Nature ; then he stops for one second of
hideous anticipation, and the powder rises up like
a thief in the night and welts him with paralysing
force over the brains. The preparation also lays
waste the cat of every-day life, and
seduces the kangaroo to his latter end.
Furthermore, if a few grains of the compound
are inserted in the animal by persuasion, or false
pretences or a pile-driver, it petrifies the unhappy
zoological specimen and turns it into a stony sub-
stance which can be used for building houses or
museums or fortifications, and which can also be
turned into cannon-balls or else filled with dyna-
mite and sewn up and then placed under a heredi-
tary throne with a view to discharging a monarch
into the air. The inventor carries about with him
a number of dried and stiffened wallabies which
have succumbed to the preparation, and he
dumped these down on the table in the Mines
Office, while Abigail backed off into a corner, and
invited the attention of the Government to- their
condition. Francis ultimately got rid of him by
suggesting that he should call again with some
samples of dead pussies, and Mr. Taylor is now
skirmishing after the back-yard cat with a view
to leading that household pet to its doom.

AVe start with a joyous snort to tell the
tale of the Chow that was left—the Mongol who
was cut off in the flower of his prosperity, and
whose sorrows were strewn like autumn leaves
upon the stream of life. At Wellington (N.Z.),
John Smith, journalist and greengrocer, wages
deadly war against the Chinkie host and camps
/
CANDID GRATITUDE.
SMITH (proprietor of the rickety umbrella) : “ GOOD BYE PYNE, OLD FELLOW, I
WOULD LEND YOU THIS GAMT, BUT TON MY SOUL IT BELONGS TO
MY SISTER.”
PYNE: “NEVER MIND, OLD MAN, I AM WET ENOUGH ALREADY.”
daily on their trail hungering after scalps. He is
a patriotic and ambidextrous citizen, and when
he is not vending the wholesome carrot he is edit-
ing the Anti-Chinaman, a paper whose mission is
to haul the Asiatic into the dust and make tue
leper even as the worm of the earth. Naturally
enough, therefore, the heathen view him as a
loathsome excrescence upon the face of nature,
and having put their tails together in solemn con-
clave they resolved that Smith should be ker-
rushed—“hung-ye-hookee,” we believe, is the
Chinese name for it. Then an astute
heathen, whose intellect was so deep that
he could saw up a tubular- brass bed-
stead and sell it for telescopes to the leading
astronomers of Europe, rose and explained how
the oppressor was to be exterminated, and when
he closed his remarks there was a sound of
Chinese applause in that back lane, and the cheers
of the heathen rang through the adjacent pur-
lieus. Next day, at the fruit and vegetable auc-
tions, the Chows ran up the prices against Smith
till he reluctantly withdrew from the contest, and
the same thing happened the day after, and
the day which ensued after that again, and.
each day the Asiatics looked cheerfully into
Smith's empty shop and hoorayed in their own
silent hieroglyphics at the approaching ruin of the
white enemy. All through that week and the
next they came round and gloated outside the dis-
mantled emporium, and asked Smith how he was
getting on, and how he “catchoe him licce," but
still the European nfau only stood and smiled
deep, dark, fathomless smiles in his deserted
premises, and at the end of a month the Chows
began to suffer from optical illusions and phantas-
magoria through buying vegetables for three
times as much as they were worth, while
their hated foe moved in a mysterious
way to make money and seemed to
lie living very satisfactorily on nothing
in particular. Three times a day he incurred
the risk of horned cattle while running
to put his money in the bank, and yet every
morning he made frantic efforts to buy bananas
and cabbages at auction, only to go away with a
melancholy aspect when he saw them knocked
down at a stupendous figure to a yellow “ slindy-
kit.” And all this time one or two white men
who were in the secret thought it rather a lark
that Smith should viciously incite the ignorant
sons of Confucius to pay such a tremendous figure
for his own vegetables, and that he should be so
aggravated when he couldn’t got them himself at
a price which would utterly ruin any horse that
tried to live on them, but they concluded that it
wasn’t any concern of theirs, and let things slide.
Finally, however, the “slindykit” burst through
trading'in “ tulnips ”at a heavy loss, and just then
they accidentally learned that Smith had been doing
a large wholesale trade in the market, and that they
had been trying to wreck him through buying
moist, malarious vegetables from his agent at an
appalling cost. Then there was another meeting,
but this time the chairman was damp with tears,
and the astute Chow whose towering intellect had
put up this great unwholesome game snuffled in all
undertone. A resolution was passed that, Smith
was the devil, and the company went into liquida-
tion and opium.
Once again the pietists of Geelong have
assembled and met together to solemnly curse
Sunday steamboat excursions to their one-horse
village. Some few years ago Messrs. Huddart
Parker tried to introduce the thin end of the
wedge of wickedness, but local influence frustrated
the firm’s business enterprise. The present in-
vaders have no stake in Geelong, and don’t care
a brass halfpenny for the natives’ immortal souls,
so the parsons are about to seek 1 bincan Gillies in
prayer, and ask him for a protection order against
the sons of Belial. If Duncan can do nothing, the
Board’s anointed will put on the breastplates of
righteousness, and muster on the wharf to pre-
vent excursionists from landing. Ne’er a sinner
wall get ashore while there is one family Bible left
to hurl at him. To preserve Geelong in its
dreary purity is a matter of supreme moment to
local Gospel-dealers. .The whole trade of the
place is in the hands of a little hallelujah ring,
who say their prayers and file their shovels with
pious regularity. And if the heathen get
a footing in Geelong they will sweep away the
cobwebs of cant, cut down prices, make the theatre
hum as it did in former times, spoil collections,
and knock all the stuffing out of the blessed
terewth. But if they can be kept away on the
Sabbath, then is Geelong safe. No stranger goes
there on week-days except to die.

WHY MOVE THE POET’S BONES?
Mr, Daniel O’Connor, M.P., and others
are still engaged collecting subscriptions for the
purpose of placing over the remains of Daniel
Henry Deniehy a monument which shall show
how much they think of him now he is dead :
Why move the poet’s bones ? Doth he unquiet
rest,
Where he by loving hands was laid ?
Hath ever mortal been complainingly addressed
By Deniehy ’s sad wand'ring shade ?
Great Shakespeare, lying in that state which
boastful stones
On lesser men can ne’er bestow,
Invoked a curse upon the man who moved his
bones,
From sound of placid Avon’s flow.
Dear to the poet’s heart the rest oft vainly sought
In life’s long pitiful fever here,
And death, which hath to others terror in the
thought,
For Deniehy had scarce a fear.
Why move the pfiet’s bones? For Deniehy sleeps
well,
Though rude the stone that's o’er him laid.
The page his mind inspired, the dead man’s frame
shall tell,
And not a monument, man-made.
Oh, then, may public scorn the impious hands
restrain
Of would-be patrons of the dead,
And still may Deniehy in peaceful sleep remain
■ln his obscure and lonely bed.

Prince Bismarck’s income from one source

The N.S.W. Commissioner to the Mel-

Mr. Smeaton, for some time editor of the
Goulburn (N.S.W.) Argus, has turned his back

The Argonaut courteously calls young

£30,000, and is considered a great “catch” in
society.
The butter of that professional butter-

“ Rimey grass ” is good, but they probably meant
“ rhymey.”
The Rev. Dr. Hay said, at the late meet-
ing of the Presbyterian Federal Assembly in Mel-
bourne, that “ Another ten years would probably
see the last of the blacks in Southern and Central

“It is true,” says Salmon’s Printing

The members of the* Victorian “ foorce ”

Waikato Regiment in the Maori War.
Mrs. Langtry, we read in a reliable
American paper, is not the sensation she was.
She has stained her hair a muddy sort of red, her
complexion has almost gone, and she rouges
clumsily. Take most Englishwomen of large
frame, she is becoming bony and angular, now that
she has passed beyond her thirtieth year.
“Oscar Wilde,” says Marion Crawford,
“ came into my study one day and sat down at a

Miss Mary Anderson (says a London

said to be Mr. Brinkworth, who is something in
London City. After her season at the Lyceum
is over, Miss Anderson returns to America pre-

fixed. At present she is living very quietly at
Hampstead with her mother.
Hon. C. J. Pharazyn legislates in the

Anna Kingsford, M.D., is dead—of con-
sumption. She it was who, in the Lady’s Pic-
toiuaj., used to tell the women to wash their faces
in kit virginal and emulsion of cucumber. Reading
her long-drawn pages of advice to the sex caused
us to mistrust woman doctors. It forced us to
the conclusion that no man would be safe in
marrying unless he owned a chemist’s shop.
r Pastor Tommy Spurgeon, of Auckland,
N.Z. (son of old preacher Spurgeon), is engaged
to be married to a Dunedin lady, and, as it is an-
nounced that he is about to visit Otago, the re-
ligious public of N.Z. is exercising itself as to
whether the trip has anything to do with “ The
J >eadly Cobra of Modern Thought, ” or whether
the youthful Boanerges is merely off to see his gal.
How unequal is Fortune in the distribu-
tion of her favours ! Eighteen years ago Sully and
W ardell was the name of a firm of mining-agents
in a N.Z. town. Walter Sully, the senior of that
partnership, is now one of the largest holders in
Broken Hill, while Frank Warded, the junior,
died recently in Auckland, in absolute penury,
and his wife, who married again, is (without
going into details) in much trouble.

Tlie N.Z. Premier has developed, into a
K.C.M.G., but he is already “full up” of the
“ honour,” as the messengers about the public
offices persist in calling him Sir ’Arry. Audacity
and love of office are the key-notes of Atkinson’s
character. ' It has been written of him, as of some
one else, that he would, with equal confidence,
take command of the Channel fleet and perform
the operation of lithotomy.
Tiger Inglis, the N.S.W. Minister of
Education, in replying to a cruelty-to-animals
deputation in Sydney the other day, said ;—“ 1
have noticed with pleasure the efforts made in
trying to foster a spirit of tenderness and mercy
in the hearts of our young towards our dumb
brethren in the lower order of life.” “ Our dumb
brethren,” &c., is good, for it includes goats and
mules, and sounds like Parkes talking about his
colleagues.
Rather a curious libel is shortly to come
off before the Court of Queen’s Bench, brought by
a solicitor against the editor of .St. Stephen’s Re-
view. The libel consisted in the solicitor having
been accused of dropping his h’s. This points to
a capital chance for supplementing the Parkes’

When Bishop Potter heard of Mrs. Brown
Potter’s intention of adopting the stage as a pro-
fession, he called and remonstrated with her on
the subject. He found her obdurate and deter-
mined. “At least,” said the distinguished divine,
“ adopt a stage pseudonym, and do not drag the
name of Potter before the footlights.” The only
American rival of the divine .Sarah drew herself
up proudly. “What,” she replied, “renounce
the name that I have made famous ? ” The bishop
retired in good order.
The present Crown Prince of Germany
attributes his withered arm, and his ear abscesses,
to a taint in the Guelph blood of his mother —the
Queen’s eldest daughter—and views her with
growing dislike. As bearing on this, we must re-
member that Bismarck always strongly opposed
any alliance between the royal families of Prussia
and England. He maintained that the latter is
scrofulous right away through. Consequently,
Bismarck and the new Empress of Germany don’t
exchange compliments except before company,
A late cable from Germany states that fresh
swellings have appeared in the throat of the
Emperor, who is now much troubled with a
cough. This looks very like laryngitis, and por-
tends evil. It looks improbable that Frederick will
be crowned in July, Another cablegram says that
the Emperor will die within six weeks. Bismarck
will probably live more than six weeks, and if he
does then Battenberg will have to go and look
after his “ morganatic ” wife and her numerous
children instead of making love to an Imperial
Princess.

JACK RABBIT: “LOOK-A-HERE JOHN, WITH O LD PASTEURS NEPHEW IN
Of 8447 arrests made iu Edinburgh during
the year 1887, only 24 of the culprits had received
a good education. Education often refines.
Bismarck, it is cabled, is bent on resign-

T Premier Parkes can do nothing for the
N.S.W. liquor-prohibitionists without consulting
his colleagues. He-will doubtless ask the opinion
of Roberts —and Garrett.
There are a million superfluous women in
England as far as the market is concerned. The

The "Victorian tobacco-industry is being-

Parnell has followed Justin McCarthy,
and given the lie direct to Carnarvon’s denial, 'in

Parnell goes further, and says Carnarvon saw that
Ireland would require Protection as well.
Parkes stated recently at Wagga that
“for the last thousand years every country in the
world had tried Protection and had found it a

Freetrade, what an appalling failure this world
must be !
Griffith has admitted in private that he is
sorry now he ever took up the Naval Defence
project as a Government platform plank. He

The S.M. Herald having taken to calling
the Gladstoniau Liberals “ Separatists ”(a London
Times expression), the Melbourne, Brisbane, and
Adelaide stupid papers have followed suit. But
the Herald hasn’t the pluck to directly attack
the Irish and their friends here, because of their
ads.
Says the Burraugoug .-Vanes (N,S, W.) :
“ What a blessing it would be to pick up a S.M.
Herald and read the obituary notices of Sir
Henry Parkes, Sir John Robertson, and a few
more Parliamentary, curses ! We don’t want any
of these tricksters, deceivers, but a new lot.” “ A
new lot ” is excellent.
M l '- Curves, Q.C., president of the Aus-
tralia Natives’ Association, is going to try and g - et
into Parliament again at next election. His first
and only constituency, when he was in politics,
was Mornington. When a general election came
round he didn't stand again. Afterwards he tried
to represent Pootscray, but failed.
If you get your living by selling tracts and

it distresses you deeply when a brutal person
stands up at an election meeting and says you
never let your servants out on Sunday night be-

dinner, even on the blessed Sawbath.
Says the S. M. Herald scribe :—-“If the
unemployed are to become an institution in the
colony let us recognise the fact, and pass some
kind of Poor-Law to deal with them.” That's the
way to size up the result of the Herald’s Foreign-
Trade gospel. The Herald Office looks as if the
architect had designed it for a poorhouse.
The English taxpayers, in order to hold
Ireland, spend yearly for soldiers and military
police £4,480,000. In the eighty-seven years

rack-renters in their exactions. — Reynolds.

yond the possibility of shuffling out, that he does
not at all sympathise with the idea of “ Australia

easy to see that Mr. Dailey considers “ the coun-

feelmg profit-mongers who regard the people as a
mere gold and silver mine. Australia for whom ‘‘
The cry of “Australia for the Australians” is
strictly synonymous with that of “Australians
for tlinuselves The only inference to be drawn
is that Mr Dailey means “ Australia for the Eng-
lish and “Australians for the English.”
Ai I ralee (Ireland) tlm other day two
young farmers were tried for smiling violently at
sergeant Clarke,- a riprisintative of the law, and
thereby endangering the peace of the country.
Ihe sergeant deposed that the prisoners “booed ”
at him as an aggravation of the original offence,
and a full and complete constable who backed him
U P, saic | the sound was something between a boo
and a laugh. Two respectable witnesses swore,
on the other hand, that the accused only laughed
in a general sort of way, and that it was doubtful-
it their mirth arose from the sergeant or from
some other cause. Ultimately the two citizens
w;ere taken to the county gaol for a month with a
' ’f.V to teaching them that a policeman was not
a thing to be amused at, and a large force of con-
stables escorted them to their destination, for fear
they might break loose.
According to common report, says a
Loudon paper, the M r. Sievier (bookmaker Sutton
of Ale]bourne), w hose presentation at a lever, last
year was cancelled on February 18th, has had an
adventurous career. Originally, he assisted his
mother uithcjuanageiiieutof a governesses’agency *
he then emigrated to South' Africa, where he
served m the Cape Mounted Police. Returning,
he took to the dramatic profession, and performed
at the theatre Royal, Dublin, in 3878-!>. Next
he took to coursing, without much success, and in
88+ wended his way to New South Wales. Here
he tried bookmaking under an assumed name
wws privileged to meet “the Jubilee.” and re-
turned to_ England m 1887. Pigeon-shooting at
the Sporting and Dramatic Club, and election to
Boodles, paved the way to his appearance at the
Court of St. James, the result of which is com-
mon history. ,

A Slight Mistake. —lt turns out the person charged
with personating a detective was innocent. At the time
the constable arrested him he was busy in his garden
sprinkling his flowers. After some conversation, the con-
stable asked him his name, and the person thinking he
asked, “ What is the name of that?” meaning the liquid,
replied, “Detective Soap.” Hence the arrest. The
prisoner was discharged. The S.M. remarked on the value
of Detective Soap, and said no doubt the insects and grubs
were arrested in their ravages on the flowers. 1 '

Twelve months ago Melbourne sassiety
Smacked its lip's o'ver the spicy story of Dr. Rose,
M.L.A., and Mrs. Weeding, the giddy wife of a
Willianlstown baker. A divorce court jury found
that Dr. Rose, an ex-methodist preacher, had
erred and strayed from the right way in conjunc-
tion with his friend, yet the judge refused a
decree nasti on the ground that the baker himself
didn’t wear the white flower of a blameless life.
During the hearing of that suit poor Mrs. Rose
paraded her confidence in the ex-preacher by sit-
ting next to Mrs. Weeding arid soothing her inno-
cent distress. It was a pathetic picture of mis-
applied faith. But in July next there will be
another shuffle of the soiled cards, and Mrs. Rose
Will, it is said, be prepared to sWear that her
doctor is a cruel, cruel man, arid that the baker’s
lawful wife Is no better than she ought to be. A
jury decided this question in the affirmative 12
months ago; however, as Mrs. Rose has Cohabited
With her hilsbarld since then, she must needs prove
fiocerit caiise and.reason for her suit. And if she
cannot, this unfortunate lady must remain as
satisfactorily married as the baker must remain,
until death do him arid Mi's. W; part. Srich Is
the divorce law which her Majesty’s Goverrt-
irierit desires to’ preserve ini its integrity. Dr.
Rose, by the way, appears to' lead a Jack-in-the-
box kind of.life, with a house in MelboUrne, a
sanatorium at Box Hill, and a farm at Mitcham.
In her petition Mrs. Rose states that, when she
was at one place, the doctor and the other lady
bobbed up serenely somewhere else. Which re-
minds, us that the medical, ex-preaching legislator
is said to include mesmerism among his many ac-
complishments, and can put ladies to sleep when
they feel so disposed.
One of the things we see in the S. M.
Herald when we come out without our gun
“Sir,—My attention was called to a letter on ‘ Boarders’
Requirements’ in your columns, and having bought a
copy of the ‘ Year (took of Australia,’ therein recom-
mended, I was horrified to find a relative’s private salary
given as well as that of other clergymen. If there be any
valid excuse for this, why are not the salaries of all the
doctors and lawyers given, whose names appear in the
book ? Why confine such questionable information to the
clergy and Civil servants? I am, &c.,
“O. Arciidalb Hall.”
We rise to suggest to this horrified gentleman that
possibly the information is given for the protection
of the tradesmen who give credit to parsons and
sich. We offer this idea with a certain amount of
hesitation, however, never having attempted to
collect any money from a parson, and we trust,
therefore, that the gentleman whose relative’s
private salary was so indecently exposed to the
carnal eye will not tear round and break things
when he reads it. For our own part, we object to
the system in toto. Few Australian citizens have
more salary than one man can look at comfort-
ably, and the idea of inviting the whole nation to
contemplate an annual income which is so small
that the owner can himself do air the contempla-
tion that is required, without sitting up at night
to overtake arrears, seems eminently absurd.

The perennial driveller continues to per-
vade the land. He raises up the temple of Lis
ho’nvash in the wilderness, and his slush is heard
in the desert afar off. Instance the following
little item on Art from a N.S.W. paper :
“On another easel was a type of work singularly
original, from the brush of Mr. Arthur Collingridge.
What do you think the subject is? No less a personage
than Lord Oarington's French chef painted in black and
white, on the hack of a real gold frying-pan ; such a
handsome face as he has, resembling the Prince of Wales
when 10 years younger”
And this is Art! Two centuries ago the greatest
painters of the age were employed to illustrate
the soles of Louis XTY.’s boots with sketches
commemorative of his campaigns, and now, in
place of producing diagrams of a monarch on his
boots, we have an artist painting the portrait of a
monarch’s assistant’s cook on the bottom of a fry-
ing-pan. And on top of this a newspaper man
goes into raptures over the cook on the ground
that his face on the base of the kitchen utensil
reminds him of the pompous commonplace of
Tummy’s countenance as it appeared 10 years
ago on a kettle, probably. This subject wants
to be treated in verse, and tenders are hereby in-
vited for an “ Ode to a Cook on a Frying-pan.”
“ Lines inspired by seeing an Emperor on a Sar-
dine-tin ” will not be eligible for this competition.
All parties endeavouring to compound a hymn are

A curious wedding came ofl in A ictoria
the other day. An attorney who had been staying
in a country town while proceedings for divorce
in which he was to be made a co-respondent were
being stopped by the interposition of friends,
became “sweet” on the servant in the hash-foundry
where he was staying, and arranged to marry her.
A male relation who was shepherding the lawyer
in his seclusion, heard of the projected union
with the housemaid and forthwith went to the
local registrar wiho was to he asked to do the deed
and told him that the bridegroom-elect was mad
as a hatter, and if he married him to the chamber-
maid after that intimation he was safe to get into
a blanky row. The registrar funked, and when
the bridal party of four came along in a cab lie
said he was somethinged or other if he d marry
that there lunatic. The lawyer, however, was not
to be baulked thus, so he went straightway to a
Methodist parson in the town and had the wedding
fixed up for a fiver, and now the young woman
who used to make the beds and fill the water-jugs
in the up-country boarding-house holds sway over
half-a-dozen slaveys in a mansion near Melbourne.
From London Figaro ;
“ On January 30, as I learn ,by letter front Sydney
(Australia), the Centennial cantata, which was the chief
feature of the Centennial celebration, was produced. The
words were by Mr. John Plummer and the music was by
Mr. Hugo Alpen. The cantata”
And so on for half-a-coluimi more wherein are
given copious slabs of such stuff as this :
“ In the gathering strength of a hundred years,
By the light of a future grand,
One tribute we bring, and triumphantly sing
The song of our beautiful land.”
Now, who wrote that letter? By the way, Mr.
John Plummer, we believe, claims to have
founded, or helped at the foundation of London
Figaro. Alas for the Land of the Bounding Kan-
garoo ! What have we done that she should be
saddled with the driveilings and be afflicted by
the adamantine impudence of such “representa-
tive ” literary men as Douglas Brooke Wheelton

At the Indo-Colonial Exhibition the
N.S.W. Court was graced with a lovely statue of
Hebe, valued at 90 guineas, and round it were
piled up samples of wine in successive tiers until
the marble female occupied a perfect bower of
liquor. This exhibit did duty also at Adelaide,
and when the Adelaide show closed the Hun who
was on deck at the time sold Hebe for 20s. to get
rid of her. He succeeded in this endeavour, and
she hasn’t been seen since. It is rumoured that
the distracted female was bought by a politician.

The attention lately devoted by the
“ Bumble Bees,” “Gushing Grasshoppers,” and
other lady-scribes to the art of fixing up “ rekerky”
sitting-room nic-nacs out of cast-off house-
hold materials induces us to here offer a fevy sug-
festions in the same line. A pair of Pa’s old
oots, touched up with gold paint, make very
pretty wall-ornaments. To add to the effect, put
patches of cotton wool on the legs to imitate
snow. An old pair of corsets, fastened round a
zinc bucket, and ornamented with creeping vines
and pretty designs in leaf, makes a very elegant
ornament to hang behind a bedroom door, for the
purpose of holding sewing and crotchet-work
materials. As an ornamental design for a front
hall, take a dozen tomato-tins and paint each one
a different colour. Tie a bow of pretty satin
ribbon of various shades about each tin, run a
clothes-line, covered with Berlin wool, through
the lot, and hang them on the wall close to the
ceiling. One can hardly imagine bow sweetly
pretty the effect of this exquisite collection is,
especially if the tins are filled with broken red
bricks, and hung so as to allow them to rattle
when agitated by the wind. An old bustle topped
with a halo of gilt stars and covered with the
caricatures of public men clipped from the Down
AND Gumtkee Jernil makes a most lovely fire-
screen. Of course, this refers to the wire bustle
only, but the rag-and-sawdust-stuffed affair can
be ornamented with strips of coloured silk and
suspended from a parlor chandelier.
At Auckland, N.Z., a man bought six jam-
tarts, covered them with “Rough on Rats,” and
then coolly and steadily surrounded the lot.
Verdict— tarts, accelerated by arsenic.

You will hardly believe this, but it is a sad,
sad fact, for all that—if any facts remain in this
world of villainy and Chinese furniture. There
is a parson in one of the suburbs of Melbourne,
who—we shudder and turn cold to say it —is so
given over to sporting in secret that—but this
must be a hideous calumny, still we tell
it as we heard it—he (pull yourselves together,
like men) actually bets on the results of his
collection-plate every Sunday! And calls it in
sporting-phrase “ The Parson’s Plate.”

A popular preacher orates re “Our Girls:” —
The buxom, bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked, fult-breasted,
bouncing lass —who can darn a stocking, mend trousers,
make her own frock, command a regiment of pots and
kettles, feed the pigs, chop wood, milk cows, wrestle with
the boys, and lie a lady withal in “ company,” is just the
sort of a girl for me, and for any worthy man to marry ;
but you, ye pining, moping, lolling, screwed-up, wasp,
waisted, putty-faced, consumption-mortgaged, music-
murdering, novel-devouring daughters of fashion and idle-
ness—you are no more fit for matrimony than a pullet is
to look after a family of fourteen chickens.

Cold world this for genius. Across the
seas from the mountainous Land of the Moa came
a youth to ‘ ‘ marvellous Melbourne ” with half-a-
lumdredweight of poems and a change of paper-
collars in his trunk. Well, he—in fact he went to
an hotel and boarded. Even genius must eat —
sometimes. But whether the poems didn't capti-
vate the booksellers, or whether —but anyhow, he
pawned five sheets and was “lumbered ” for the
same. We had a dim hope at first that they were
sheets of manuscript—but no, they were legiti-
mate linen sheets belonging to the hotel. This
reminds us that a well-known literary man in
Melbourne actually did, upon one occasion, try to
raise money on one of his stories—half-written—
and found a man to lend it! But on the whole
linen sheets -or even calico—are better than
sheets of poetry with the public—who. are mostly
pawnbrokers.

A story, gruesome in. its ghastly waggish-
ness, comes from Milan. There has been ice and
snow in that city, too, and the pavements ha\e
been slippery, though Italiali skies were above
them. And so —thus runs the tale—an amiable
bridegroom, who had just taken to himself a
second wife, wished to prevent his new partner
from slipping down outside the door of her dwel-
ling on the first day of wedded bliss ; and he took
the ashes of his former wife, who had been cre-
mated, and sprinkled them on the threshold for
her successor to tread on !

Ai yropos of the pre-
sent N.S.W. mining
boom, we are reminded
of the big Thames (N.Z.)
mining boom of 1870 and
’7l, in which Melbourne
and Ballarat investors
were so largely interested.
The Caledonian mine
was turning out 20,000
ounces of gold a week,
and had paid over half a
million in dividends,
when a mixed syndicate
of Victorians and Auck-
landers secured the ad-
joining ground, the T(Hi-
key’s, out of which the
rich shoot was supposed
to run. When the
Caledonian drive was
within 50 feet of the
1 rjundary, Took ey V
shares stood at £4O, cn
the prospect of the reef
continuing. But it didn't,
and the moment the
news reached the Auck-
land shareholders that
the lode had “pinched '
out, three or four of the
smartest of them char-
tered the s.s. Coomerang
there was no cable in
those days—s 1 i p p e d

Cornwell —who, by the way, is a very handsome

which sets us wondering how the Sunday paper is
getting along meantime, and what the editor
wants in Australia. We take a tender interest in
Phil. Robinson, partly because of his Jove-like
front, but chiefly because lie left us in such a hurry
last year to attend his invalid offspring. It was
so touching to think of the great war-correspon-
dent—a man who had quietly smoked his cigar on

THE TALE OF THE TRUNK.
Nellie S. was sweetly sleeping,
Sleeping in her cosy bunk,
When into her bedroom cheeping
Burglars cairie, and saw a trunk.
Night it was ; ’neath the horizon
Bong the golden sun had sunk —
Biit they quickly clap’t their eyes on,
Oil that Saratoga trunk.
Still she lay and never shifted—
Ne’er an eye the goddess wunk ;
So the bold marauders lifted
(In a double sense) that trunk.
’Mid the silence quite unbroken
Out again those villains slunk;
Leaving not a single token
Of that Saratoga trunk.
Nellie no such crime suspected
(She was slumb’ring like a monk
After meals), and undetected
They departed with the trunk.
Had they dared to gaze upon her—
Then, with admiration drunk,
They’d have seized the prima donna,
Taken her—and left the trunk.
Yet, with some dull sense of duty,
From that sacrilege they’ve shrunk ;
We have still onr peerless beauty,
Though, alas ! she’s lost her trunk.
Oh ! we tremble like a jelly
(Shake and shiver in a funk)
At the awful thought of Nellie
Being snavelled —like the trunk.
In conclusion, may our curses,
Curses rest 011 every skunk,
Who inspired these touching verses
By purloining Nellie’s trunk !
ABORIGINALITIES.
A Western N.S.W. sheep-breeder, whose
wool is fanious, was very anxious that his last
year’s clip should be done carefully, £0 he selected
the best shearers of the district and paid them 25
per cent, extra; The old man soon began to
f rumble—his men worked too qtlickly and hacked
is flock so outrageously that more than half the
hailds were discharged the first wfie’e. The
boss watched every stroke of the shears and
cursed furiously every time that “ tar ”
was called. One day he for a few minutes
left the shed to turn out the shorn sheep; in-
stantly the speed of his men was doubled. A
fine pedigree iam was vety “ lumpy ” about the
heck and a careless stroke severed its windpipe. Here
was a situation eminently calculated to make a
holier man than a shearer blaspheme. In two minutes
the boss would be inside the shed, and -well,
the consequences were too awful to dream of ! A
happy thought, the flashing of a mdment !
Throwing his shears aside, the ram-slayer re-
covered the animal with its great fleece and de-
posited the whole in the halLfilled wool-sack. In
came the squatter as the shearer went out to
bring inanothersheep. A little while and theheavy
weight of the wool-press jammed down the body,
blood and bones of a 50-guinea ram, and in a few
weeks a bale that was not all golden fleece was
being carried over the bright Pacific to the best
London market.

Away out in a Riverina paddock some
rabbits were lying under a saltbush discussing the
situation. “Things are getting pretty sultry,”
said a young rabbit. “This carbonic acid gas
makes it cpiite unsafe to go down a burrow at all. ”
“What do you want to go down burrows for?”
retorted an old graybeard, as he languidly kicked
some poisoned wheat out into the open, where a
wild pigeon ate it; “I don’t see any necessity to
burrow in this climate. Camp out, man, camp
out!” “What about this rabbit-proof fence?”
said the young one. “ Dig under it,” replied the

old fellow. “ Then there’s one of those infernal
cats they turned out has made his appearance out
my way, ” said another. “ Oh, he’ll soon drop down
to living on the young lambs,” said the old boy—
“ young lambs are a lot easier to catch than rab-
bits. ” The conversation died out for a while until
one spoke up : “X see Pasteur has offered to give
that £25,000 to a hydrophobia hospital.” “ I
wouldn’t be in any hurry, if I were Pasteur, ”
said the old rabbit. , “ To begin with, he might
neVer earrt it; and if He did I don’t think the
Cornstalks are shell fctdls as to hand over £25,000
to a Frenchman. They’ll chouse him out of it
some way, you see. Besides, I think I know
enough to deal with any microbe that ever was
foaled.” “In what way? ” asked the others. The
old rabbit looked round his audience before he
answered. “You know the working of this
microbe caper ?” he said. “It is to give us a
kind of rabbit-smallpox—something that will
spread all through us. But there is a simple
remedy- compulsory vaccination ! Let them bring
along their microbes —our troubles ! ”

Not long ago the death of a Wealthy
Scotchman was announced by the colonial papers.
He had a large run on the Murrumbidgee, and
believed in cheap servants. Once he engaged two
runaway sailors to shepherd his rams, and his
only instructions were, “Look out for the old
blackfellow’s flock, and keep the rams from box-
■ ing. ” A week afterwards he rode out to see his
shepherds, and found them running through the
flock, chasing first one ram and then another. With
a “ Hey ! what the highest Fahrenheit are you
at ?” he was soon with them. The nearest sailor
said, “ To Davy Jones’ with yon and your rams !

Dear Bulletin,— 1 suppose you*receive
hundreds of letters on the Chinese Question. Now,
] Jus one. In the little town of Coonamble, N.S.W,,
10 arrived at one pup, and they went to a den
already crowded. The local (chief) paper spoke
manfully on the subject. Last night I was talk-
ing to four natives on the same. They all swore
and that was all. They would not. promise to
join an Anti-Chinese League. One of them said
Chinaman did not affect him because he was a
horse-breaker. He could not even see that if a
Chinaman was placed as* (say) groom, where the
-groom, whom he had ousted, was a horse-breaker,
that then there Would be opposition in his trade.
Again (here I must enunciate an axiom), all
Coonamble men are, in theory, fighting-men ; but
these four fighting youths were afraid to go up to
the woolwash and—well—wash the yellow off the
bosses who employ Ohinkles. As I have often
written to you concerning the young bush native,
he does not care much for his country. Given
horse, smoke, full belly, and red necktie, what
' does the future matter to him ? Of course the
educated native is a different article, and even
here I find many of them say ; “I’ll employ whom
1 d well please.” That is, if they see a quick
pound or two. There are worse men than even
Irish dynamiters. It is horrible to think that I,
brought up in the fusty Cqlvinistic Scotch Church,
should, in my old age, begin to believe in a mix-
ture of nitre-glycerine and clay, instead of sound
doctrine from the pulpit. The Legislature has
not consulted me as to the new Mongolian Bill. I
should only have two clauses! L Every employer
of a Chinaman to pay £5O for every year or part
of a year for each Chinaman (or Kanaka) em
ployed. 2. Every Chinese trader to affix a £1
stamp to every article sold by him. That would
meet the case.- Yours, Scotty the Wbinklek.

A story from the Far North. A party of
three—two old hands and a very green and sappy
now-chum—started out from a station to round up
stray cattle. The day was hot enough to freckle
the complexion of a stone god, and the new-chum
was almost fried in his saddle, but he peeled off
most of his raiment and leaked grease till sun-
down, when a halt was called, and the party
camped by a small but swift stream. Suddenly
the new-chum’s mates heard a yell and a splash
and, making for the river, they discovered
Johnny-Come-Lately floundering in mid-stream
spouting like a whale and imploring to be assisted
out of the wet. His mates were aware that lie
could not swim a stroke, and conjectured that all
was over with him, but as lie continued to float
and yell they followed him down, and at last, by
careful engineering, reached him with a hooked
stick and towed him ashore at a bend, after he
had been 15 minutes in the water, floating all the
time as buoyantly as a cork. This was a mystery
but it was explained when he landed—-he had been
so dreadfully sunburnt that the'blisters wouldn't
let him sink!

i’HE HAPSBURG DOUBLE IRON-FRAMEL
PIANOS
Possess the following advantages
Ist. The WIRES are of a very high quality, anc
intensely sensitive ; their vibrations, reverbe
rated by a sounding board of special construe
tion, are clear and bell-like, instead of the
muffled, or tinkettly, or metallic sounds so
common im cheap English or French pianos.
2nd. The action is perfect check repeater.
3rd. All the Hapsburg Pianos are Trichord.
4th. They are all Seven Octaves.
sth. They have consolidated Iron Frames of great
strength, thus resisting the rapid mutations of
a humid tropical climate, and requiring tuning
only at long intervals.
6th. The Felts are Clinched on the Hammers, in-
stead of being fastened by glue, as is the case
with nearly every piano except the Hapsburg,
7th. They have Brass or Nickel-faced Rest Planks,
w bM instead of the old-fashioned perishable style.
Btn. Rust is guarded against, wherever possible,
r jby the substitution of bronze for other metals.
9th. The outer cases are handsome in design, and
of durable and beautiful woods ; they can be
had in Walnut, or in Walnut and Gold, or in
Ebony and Gold.

The cost of a week’s washing by the Beale Patent
Washer is about One Shilling.
Beale Patent Washer, Wringer and Mangle.
The Beale Patent Washer may be simply de-
scribed as follows, and we ask you kindly to refer
to the illustration. The vertical tub is very care-
fully made, with fluted sides. It is stationary, only
the water and clothes being agitated by an accu-
rately shaped dolly, which is worked by a fly-wheel.
The clothes are simply dropped in, no arrangement
or packing being wanted. The special reversing
gear moves this dolly s'wiftly backwards and for-
wards, and a very small expenditure of strength
suffices to lash the water into a mass of foaming
suds. In the process the clothes are floated to and
fro, up and down; currents and cross-currents of
water are formed which meet and are forced through
and through the fabric, carrying away every particle
of dirt and stain. The linen being merely sus-
pended in the water, is not rubbed and scrubbed
as in hand-washing. Neither has anything to
submit to the hand-wringing process which in-
sensibly rips, tears and wears the clothes. Thus,
the most delicate fabrics cannot be torn by our
system of washing. Everyone lias noticed that
their clothes seem to be as much worn by washing
as by use. This is caused by the fierce rubbing
they get upon washing-boards, or by the hands.
With the Beale Patent Washing Machines this
friction is done away with. Therefore, the clothes
will last far longer than by hand-washing, however
careful When the washing is done, the tub should
be wiped out, so that it be always sweet and clean.
There is no false bottom, and nothing to accumu-
late greasy sediments.

HON. SECRETARY (pro tern.):
J- J- Slade, Esq., 303 Pitt-street, Sydney,
This Company is formed for the purpose of
working, for Silver, Gold and Lead) thirty acres
of absolute freehold, acquired direct from the
Crown in 1882. It is situate on the Star River,
Kennedy district, about 50 miles from Townsville
(the proposed capital of Northern Queensland).
The mine was discovered by a Greek prospector,
named Koledas, in 1881, and, under the existing
land law in Queensland at that period, Koledas
made application for the purchase of the freehold
at 30s. per acre—the ruling price for mineral
Crown lands. Through some informality, his ap-
plication was refused. The Mines Department,
however, caused the land to be put up to public
auction. At this time Silver Mining was com-
paratively unknown in Australia, an impression
prevailing that nothing under 150 oz. per ton would
pay for the erection of smelting works. How
mistaken this view was is best demonstrated by
the fact that--as in the case of the Broken Hill
mines, ores yielding an average of 350 z. to the
ton give enormous financial returns, placing a
market value on the Proprietary Blocks alone, of
upwards of SIX MILLIONS STERLING.
Rumours appear to have circulated that Koledas
had in his prospecting operations exposed ores of an
exceptionally rich character, assaying many hun-
dred ounces to the ton. Owing to these reports the
30 acres of land realised at auction £l5OO, or £1455
over the upset value. Koledas, notwithstanding
the sale, took possession of the land, and before
his ejectment could be accomplished, took out 12
tons of ore, and shipped same to England. It has
been ascertained he obtained a return of over £7O
per ton net (or about 500 oz. of silver to the ton).
The preliminary trouble with Koledas, and the
deaths of some of the original proprietors, have
up to the present time retarded the proper de-
velopment of the property. The title now is un-
questionable.
REPORTS ON THE MINE.
The directors possess reports from such recog-
nised scientific authorities and mining experts as
the late Professor Denton (the eminent geologist),
Mr. Robert L. Jack (Queensland Government
geologist), Messrs. Bennett and Gamble (mining
engineers), Mr. Richard King (managing director
of the Ravenswood Silvermining Company), and
Mr. E. J. King; and these reports, by the facts
and statistics stated therein, will give more con-
vincing evidence of the value of the property than
anything which can be written in an ordinary
prospectus. It will not be out of place, however,
to mention that isolated masses of ore, consisting
of carbonate of lead—some weighing nearly 7cwt.,
containing 500 oz. of silver to the ton —have been
found near the top of the Hero Hill. The property
is situate in mountainous country, and forms the
greater portion of a high hill. A tunnel driven
near the base of the freehold would cut the main
lode in the settled formation, and thus permit
stoping from the higher levels. Many of the sur-
face indications have been followed in a desultory
fashion with most gratifying results. Twelve tons
of “first” were raised, realising over £7O per ton
net; 597 bags of mixed ores, in all weighing 25
tons 9cwt., were also shipped to London per
steamer Merkera, and returned 62£ per cent, of
lead and 1540 z. of silver to the ton. The net pro-
ceeds amounted to £875 15s. Four tons have
within the past fortnight been forwarded to Ade-
laide for smelting.
These statements, backed up by the sterling
and reliable reports referred to, will be, it is con-
sidered, sufficient testimony to the genuine worth
of the property, and its value as an investment.
REPORT OF RECENT WORKINGS ON THE
HERO MINE.
N. and S. Lode. —A cutting has been put in
27ft. 6in. long, lift, deep, and lift. wide.
A drive has been put in at the end of cutting,
16ft. on the course of the lode. A winze has been
sunk on the drive 4ft. deep, and a barrow road
20ft. long and sft. deep has been cut at the bottom
of the cutting to take stuff from drive.
A cutting has been put in further south on the
lode, Bft. wide, Oft along the course of load, and
6ft. deep. Cleaned out tunnel E. W. lode, and
timbered same ready for stoping.
An assay from this tunnel gave the following
result: —Lead, 66 per cent. ; Silver, 6320 z. 2dwt.
per ton of ore.
EDWARD JAMES KING,
of the Ravenswood Silver-mining Co.
ASSAYS FROM VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
FREEHOLD.
Mere fire assays alone, unsupported by the
smelting of a bulk mass of ore, are not to be de-
pended upon as indicative of the true commercial
value of a lode. Fortunately the shipments to
England of so many tons fully bear out the
appended assays. Forty-one tons of average ores
have now been smelted, yielding over ll,ooooz. of
silver, 50oz. of gold, and 18 tons of lead.
ASSAY BY PROFESSOR DIXON.
The following are the results given by the sam-
ples of silver lead ores, &c., sent to me. The
sample marked “ Hero ” contains ;
No. 1.
Lead 46.64 per cent.
Silver 5200 z. Idwt. Ogr. per ton.
Gold Ooz. sdwt. sgr. per ton.
The silver in this sample is present as chloride,
whilst the lead exists as carbonate and sulphate of
lead with traces of galena.
No. 2.
Marked “Hero ‘seconds,’” contains :
L ea d 8.71 per cent.
Silver 2310 z, 17dwt. Bgr. per ton.
*T T? ? oz± 13dwt. 14gr. per ton.
In this ore the lead is present as carbonate only
and the silver as chloride.

GENERAL REMARKS.
With the exception of £5OOO to cover genera
expenses, together with the cost of floating the
Company and brokerage, the present proprietors,
in evidence of their thorough belief in the richness
of this property, accept paid-up Shares in pay-
ment thereof.
In the beginningof April it is intended to adopt
the course indicated by the late Professor Denton,
and commence the tunnel at base of Hero Hill.
At the same time a body of men will be kept at
work following the rich ore in view. A special
feature of this mine is the uniform distribution of
gold through the property. The entire hill carries
gold, and steps will be taken to make a trial
crushing of the “gossan,” with a view to the
profitable extraction of the precious metal on a
large scale.
The gold which is proved by assay to be in the
ore, forms an important factor in its value, and
should more than pay the entire expenses of rais-
ing and smelting.
Although very rich patches of chlorides have
been discovered, no sensational assays are pub-
lished, as more reliance can be placed on the solid
fact of 41 tons of average ore being smelted for a
return of 11,0000 z., or over 2500 z. of silver to the
ton.
Should a concentrated lode mass be cut by the
tunnel, thousands of tons could be quickly raised.
An output of merely 2000 tons would return the
whole capital, even if Called up, which is impro-
bable.
SPECIAL NOTICE.
The Contributing Shares available were over
applied for on MONDAY , 9th instant, before
12 o'clock, and the Share List is absolutely closed.

A Special Invitation.
Wc especially invite a tr'al by all those sufferers
from kidney and liver complaints who have failed
to obtain relief from other remedies and from
doctors. aturo’s great remedy, dr. bell’s
bitters, has effected cures in n any obstinate
cases. It acts at once on the kidneys, li ver and
bowels, cleansing the system of all poisonous
humours and restoring a healthy condition to those
important organs. Do not be discouraged, but
try it.
Ik tub Sufferers from Consumption, Scrofula, and
General Debility, will try Scott’s Emulsion of Puke Cod
Liver Oil with Htpopiiospiiitbs, they will find immediate
relief and a permanent benefit. The Medical Profession
in the various countries Of the world, universally declare
it a remedy of the greatest value ; and as it is very
palatable, it can be readily taken by the most sensitive
stomach, and will never fail to give relief and comfort to
the sufferer. Any Chemist can supply it at 4s. 6d.*
Old Port, Claret, Hock, Sherry, Rousillon, Madeira,
Muscat, Tokay, &c. Unequalled High-class Wines are
only to be had from Hookings of 410 George-street, under

A Lovely and Delicate Complexion.— This is ob-
tained by using Rowlands’ Kalydor, an emollient and
harmless milk tor the face, hands, and arms ; it removes
sunburn, tan, freckles, redness and roughness of the skin,
cutaneous eruptions, &c., and produces soft, fair, and
delicate skin. Avoid metallic and greasy cosmetics, which
ruin the skin. Rowland’s Odonto, a non-gritty tooth-
powder, whitens the teeth. Ask chemists for Rowlands’
articles.
MO MORE HARD TIMES.
If you will stop spending so much on fine clothes, rich
food'and style, buy good, healthy food, cheaper and better
clothing, get more real and substantial things of life
every wav, and especially stop the foolish habit of em-
ploying expensive quack doctors or using so much of the
vile humbug medicine that does you only harm, but put
your trust in that simple, pure remedy, Dr. Soule’s Ameri-
can Hop Hitters, that cures always at a trifling cost, and
you will see good times and have good health. —
“ Chronicle.”
GUILTY OF WRONG.’
Some people have a fashion of confusing- excellent
remedies with the large mass of “patent medicines,” and
in this they are guilty of a wrong. There are some
advertised remedies fully worth all that is asked for them,
and one at least we know of : Dr. Soule’s American Hop
Bitters. The writer has had occasion to use the Bitters in
just such a climate as we have most of th6 year in Bay
City, and has always found them to he first-class and
rehab!o, doing all that is claimed for them. - “ Tribune.”
The Happiness of Millions.— On what does the hap-
piness of populations or individuals depend? On that
inestimable blessing—-Health. Ought it not then to be the
study of every Colonist to ascertain foi -himself the best
means by which this priceless boon, once attained, can be
for ever preserved ? The p nswer must be in the affirma-
tive. A large number of Colonists in New Zealand are
aware that there is a medicine which not only wards off
Disease, but rapidly cures all maladies that occur there,
and actually prolongs life. This invaluable medicine is
Freeman’s Original and Genuine Chlorodyne, which cures
and arrests, in their very earliest stages, all the Diseases
that happen, not only in New Zealand, but in all the Aus-
tralian Colonies.—Sold everywhere throughout the
Colonies. Insist upon having “ Freeman’s ” only. Reject
substitutes as they are worthless. Trade Mark, an Ele-
phant *
William’s Australian Insecticide is death to all insects.
Simple in application—sure in effect. This is the only
genuine Insect Destroying Powder, being certain death to
all kinds of insects, while it is perfectly harmless to animal
life, and therefore may be used without the slightest
apprehension. For the extermination of Mosquitos
especially, the Insecticide has no equal—as the fumes of
the burnt powder, while throwing off a pleasant odour,
are at the same time most destructive to them. Sold in
Is. boxes by all chemists and storekeepers. Manufactured
only by W." Williams, Pharmaceutical Chemist, 257 King-
street,'Newtown. Wholesale from Messrs Elliott Bros.,
and E. Prosser & Go.

Gentlemen,— I have great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s Dandelion B.ttera. I have been
suffering for several years with liver complaint,
and been under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a diffe r ent
man. I can, therefore, with truthfulness, advise
all who suffer from liver comp’aint to try then?,—*

depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change in
my system, and has removed from my mind the
honibly depres:ed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known

THE GREATEST CURATIVE SUCCESS OF
THE AGE.
"VTO medicine introduced to the public has ever
-t-’ met with the success accorded to bell’s
bitters. It stands to-day the best known cura-
tive article in the world. Its marvellous renown
is not due to the advertising it has received. It
is famous by reason of its inherent virtues. It
does all that is claimed for it. It is the most
powerful, speedy and effective agent known for
the building up of debilitated systems and general
family medicine.
Ophir, N.S.W., Dec. 9th, 1886.
Bell’s Bitters Manufacturing Co.—Gentlemen —
I have been a sufferer for seventeen years from
the effect of a cold I contracted while at work
under ground. I have tried almost everything, I
have also been to several doctors and have not re-
ceived any benefit, at times I am able to work for
a few weeks then get bad and for as many months
am confined to the house. I got a bottle of your
Bitters last week from Orange, and took it within
a week, for every i irae the cough was trouble-
some I took a little, and I am glad to say I am
greatly improved, for I am able to do a little
mining since.
Ed. McConnell.
Ophir Diggings, via. Orange, N.S.W.
Bell’s Bitters has been before the public but
a few months, yet the remarkable success which has
attended its use in the many hospitals and asylums
where it has been tested, has resulted in its being
placed on the list of regular supplies needed for
the da.i’y use of the institution.

One out of every 105 mothers who added

Among those who took degrees at Mel

Country husband to his city bride : “ Mary

Citv bride : “Why, dear, I locked her up in the

A retired tradesman as illiterate as a
Bosjesman and as rick as Crresus, says that the
only way to keep a hat is “,"to put your entrails
inside of it.” He means initials, but it makes no
difference.
They were very happy. His name was
Smith. He was married to his third wife. Each
lady had brought him a fortune, which he hus-
banded judiciously. People spoke of him as
Goldsmith. It was very unkind.
Some substantial stone hotels are going up
at Broken Hill, and the proprietors of the early
gin-case and kerosene-tin erections are now not so
haughty in their demands of two and three thou-
sand pounds for the goodwill and furniture of
their businesses.
Here is a specimen slab of the silly nonsense
which the Sydney Morning Herald prints in rc
the operations of the late local annual military en-
campment :
“ Just as the crew were about to fire their fourth round
they were signalled to return to the Wolverene, as Captain
Hixson had come aboard and wished to see Captain Lee.
The latter having- returned went across to Middle Head
with Captain Hixson and lunched with Colonel Roberts.”
As we have not yet a king or queen in Australia
to grovel to, we are beginning to bow down before
Hixson and Lee and Roberts and their corned
beef and cabbages !
Some four-and-twenty camels are grazing
near the railway line between Silvertou 'and

joyfully hails them as kangaroos.
There are already somewhere about 12,000
people at Broken Hill, the N.S.W. silver city,
1 an d yet the present Post-office is scarcely as large
I as a (log-kennel, while the one approaching com-
pletion is not more roomy than a fowl-house. -
The following official notice was posted at
the recent Middle Head (N.S.W.) military en-
campment “ All l>ottles to be buried or carted
away. Officers’ and sergeants’ messes are espe-
cially cautioned with regard to this order.” Com-
ment would be cruel.
Tennyson Smith (son of James of that ilk)
for some years on the editorial staff of the Bris-
bane Telegraph, and who is well known also
| in Sydney press circles, passed through Sydney
| last week on his way to Melbourne. The
j newspaper world of the Queensland capital
| is not distinguished by good-fellowship, but
on the occasion of the genial Tennyson’s de-
parture rivalry was forgotten and he was wished
God-speed by a trio of editors, a sub-editor and
reporters galore, who presented him with a hand-
some gold chain and locket.
The Toowoomba (Q) Chronicle the other
(lay reached for the hair of its loathsome contem-
porary, whose ignorance, it remarked, “could only

victory created a sensa-

ing last season that the
Earl of Durham brought
certain charges against
Ohetwynd, which charges
constitute the Jockey

Dear Bulletin,—l read your comments
on the objects and principles of the “Australian
.Natives’ Association” with infinite pleasure.
British born and bred, 1 love this, my adopted
country, the birthplace of Iny children, with an
intensity far exceeding that which I, at any time,
felt for my native land. No Australian can love
Australia more than I do. Few Australians can
possibly be so fully apprised of the advantages
they enjoy, so conscious of the dangers to which
they are exposed by their own apathy and the
unholy alliance between earth-grabbing scoundrels
without and title-hunting traitors within, as I am.
I have endured the follies, burdens, and miseries
of the older lands, consequently enjoy more fully
the freedom of this, the newer world, therefore I
object strongly to the narrow-mindedness that
prevents me joining - a body whose professed
object is the fostering of national sentiment,

A CASE FOR MICROBES.
N.S.W. (to Pasteur): “OOH, I’M SO BAD. TOO MUCH RABBIT IN MY INTERIOR,”
the paving of the way towards the formation
of the “United States of Australia,” while
it admits my son, who possesses not a tithe of my
experience and ability, and is more concerned
about cricket-bats than political or economic
questions. One sentence in your article, only one,
1 object to. In it you state that the “ Australian
Natives’Association ” is the only body “on the
face of this continent which pretends to phrase
that sentiment,” i.e. Australian Nationalism.
This is misleading—l will not use a stronger epi-
thet. Have you forgotten, or if not, why do you so
persistently ignore the Australian Republican
League? Tis true it’s president is not a Q.C. ;
’tis true that most of its meetings are held in the
Domain, or at the Queen’s Statue; ’tis true that
none of its members are wealthy, or respectable;
’tis true that its propagandists work is done by
working men among working men; but surely
these are the very things that should
above all _ others recommend it to a jour-
nal professing advanced democratic principles.
I ask you in this matter to be consistent as you
were wont to be. Members of the league have
recently visited other colonies for the pur-
pose of promulgating their views, and have there
received lengthy notices and kindly encourage-
ment from the Press. It is, therefore, all the
more discouraging to find their unselfish, disin-
terested labours so slighted by the paper whom
they regard with love and admiration as the chief
mouthpiece, of the principles they venerate. Con-
temptuous indifference from friends is assuredly
more galling than the loudly-expressed aversion
of foes. —Yours, Geo. Black, Broken Hill,

Vulapiik is a universal language which

Seven weeks ago we cut the following tele-
graphic item from the Sydney E. News. We
have been waiting ever since for further develop-
ments, but nothing having been heard up to date
which is calculated to throw light on the circum-
stance in question, we offer it to the public in all
its majestic baldness :
“ London, February 19; —Mr. Balfour, Chief Secretary
for Ireland, emerged from a meeting of the Cabinet
Council on Saturday, mentally excited. He walkedabout
in the bitter cold dir, hatless, and with his hands clasped
behind his head.”
The outlines of this picture have been drawn by
' a master hand. Details, it is true, are wanting,
btlt the impassioned fervour of the affair
and the salient features of the other thing are pre-
sented in a way which is calculated to appeal to
the meanest and most commonplace understand-
ing. There had been a Cabinet Council that day,
and the pig-rearing squires who form the bulk of
the Tory Government had been sitting with their
mouths open, in the agonies of an unaccustomed
endeavour to think, while the two or
three dudes who lend tone to the assemblage
had stated that in their—-haw—opinion, dontcher-
know, something ought to be —haw—done
to those beastly low Irish fellows. Then
all of a sudden the door opened and Balfour flew
out in such a hurry that he either forgot his hat or
didn’t think it safe to stop to get it, or else some-
body had promised to throw it out of the window
after him, or possibly he had come with the hat
on that somebody else had lost on the last occasion
when they met together and the other man had
foreclosed on it and told him what he thought of
him. Anyhow he had no hat on, and he was
mentally excited. He wasn’t morally astounded
or physically flabbergasted or intellectually
floored ; he was simply staggered in the thinking
organ. And he was so much paralysed that he
walked about clinging to his own back, hair, in-
stead of mounting a 200-guinea horse, or getting
into a gilded chariot, or even calling a cab. He
wore the outward aspect of a man who had
been kicked in his tenderest feelings and grassed
on the _ field of human sympathy, and while he
was waiting for the arrival of a gilded flunkey
clad in purple and fine linen with his hat, the
Bennett family took down a few particulars about
him and offered them to the gaze of a soulless,
ignoble public.
Says the London correspondent of the S. M.
Herald ;
“ Earl Russell, grandson of the famous Lord John
Russell, took his seat in the House of Lords this week.
Some curiosity has been expressed as to which side the
noble Earl would take in politics. I believe, however, he
will be a Liberal Unionist. Inasmuch as all the land he
owns is in Ireland it is difficult to see how he could he
otherwise. When Lord John Russell was made a peer
the Duke of Bedford settled an estate of about 3000 acres
in County Meath and 1000 acres in County Louth upon
him. Land in Meath is about the best in Ireland.”
From this it would appear either that the Herald
is deliberately becoming ingenuous, or that it now-
a-days doesn't know enough to come in out of the
rain. “It is difficult,” &c. Of course it is. Of
course he must be a Unionist! It doesn’t matter
a curse on which side are eternal justice, truth
and right. The idea that an absentee landlord
descended even from Lord J ohn Russell should
be anything but a Coercionist, is too absurd for
even the consideration of a Herald writer. The
moral is plain. Take away the 4000 acres from
his “ lordship ” and lo ! we shall behold a Hynd-
man, a Henry George, or a Michael Davitt.
Then, and not tilt then, will landlords cease to lie
as a class upholders of tyranny.
It is a melancholy fact that Chinamen

will reward his exertions.
In Mount Morgan, Queensland has the
greatest of the world’s gold-mines; in Broken
Hill, N.S. Wales possesses a peerless silver-mine,
ho far, each colony has been pre-eminent in its
own speciality, but Queensland is now entering-
-Ihe lists in the silver-field, and puts before the
N.S.W. public to-day the prospectus of the Hero
freehold Silver and G. M. Co., which is well
worthy of consideration at the hands of the in-
vesting public. The Hero is the mine a trial of
40 tons of ore from which yielded half-a-ton of
silver.
The Sydney Sabbath Observance Associa-
tion, a trades-union of clergymen and deacons,
have threatened Editor Ellis, of the local Sunday
Times, with an action at law under an ancient
“ Hinglish ” statute, for publishing advertise-
ments relating to Sunday concerts. Mr. Ellis
replies that the other Sydney papers do exactly
the same thing, and that, as the concerts are
authorised by Government and conducted in
places of entertainment licensed by Government,
lie must assume them to be perfectly legal. He
further cheerfully reminds his pious critics that
the so-called “ services ” held in the churches on
Sunday evenings, are nothing but “Sunday con-
certs, in which paid choristers sing, and paid
parsons recite stolen sermons and read passages
from a sacred book, which their daily lives out-
rage. ”
Mr. F. M. Clements, 111 King-street, New-
town, Sydney, has sent us a copy of “ Clements’Dic-
tionary of Diseases and Family Guide,” a most useful
work of 40 pages, and now in its 70th thousand, which
he supplies free, on application, to every householder.
The information and recipes contained therein appear
most reliable, and the instructions given for the home
treatment of the different ailments which afflict mankind
are most full and complete. Mr. Clements is also the pro-
prietor and manufacturer of Clements’ Quinine and Iron
Tome, ra phosphated preparation of ferrous salts with
the principal cinchonic alkaloids, a remedy of the
highest value in all debilitating and anaemic diseases,
as it supplies the body with its natural chemical foods,
iron, lime, &c., which are present in quite inadequate
quantities in nearly all foods raised and grown on Austra-
lian soil. Thus it is absolutely necessary for every person
to occasionally supply the animal organisation with its
essential mineral elements by artificial means ; otherwise
sickness, disease and premature death must ensue. Mr.
Clements is also the originator of various other medicinal
preparations well worth the attention of the suffering
portion of humanity, and it is by the encouragement of
such enterprising local men that Australians will best
serve Australian interests.*
