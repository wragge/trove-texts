THE RED RAGE.
Some Jingo Literature .
DOES the Jingo possess any sense of humor ?
Judging by his writings and his speak-
ings, he does not. Jingo literature, in
the main, is as stodgy and as ridiculously
deadly in its earnestness as the catalogue of a hide
sale. In this respect, of course, it is on a level
with other strenuous creeds and beliefs. Most
persons who are in grim earnest about anything
—bi-metallism, stamp-collecting, Methodism,
Jingoism, spooks, or rushing with a green bag
after blue beetles —become bitterly serious. Some
of them become only serious, and some become
ridiculous. The Jingo mostly becomes ridi-
culous.
<* * * *
For instance, consider this “poem,” which was
read by a full-grown citizen, said to be in his
right mind, to many other full-grown citizens
without visible straws in their hair, at the
great banquet given to Premier Seddon, of
Maoriland, just before his departure for England
to walk on tne first button of his waistcoat,
like the Serpent of Genesis, at Edward Vll.’s
Coronation. Here it is in all its glory
TO THE RIGHT HON. R. J. SEDDON, P. 0., LL.D.,
On his Departure to Attend the King’s Coronation.
(Read by Mr. A. L. D. Fraser, at Mr.
Seddon’s Farewell Meeting at Napier.)
Alone the grand Old Country stood
Battling her righteous cause,
Shedding her best and noblest blood,
Defending her just laws ;
While kindred nations look askance
With envy, hate, or fear,
Knowing they dare not break a lance,
They vilify and sneer ;
Though nobly Britain treats her foe,
Is gen’rous and humane,
Relieving hunger, soothing woe,
Among the friends of slain ;
Yet do the lying, sland’rous band
Their baseless charges make,
While traitors in their dear Home-land
Would British prestige shake.
Down in the sunlit southern seas,
Far from the sounds of strife,
Where honest toilers earn their ease
And lead a manly life,
A voice is raised, a mighty call,
’Tis heard throughout the land—
“ Shall we see men of England fall
And never lift a hand ?
Let us go forth and share the fight.
And show,these foreign churls
They little know old England’s might
Where’er her flag unfurls.”
Such was the call; full well we know
The answer that was made,
And history has a page to show
How earnest was our aid ;
How time and oft our men went forth
And rode, and fought, and fell
Beside their comrades of the north,
So valiantly and well.
A nd now we bid God-speed to one
Whose patriotism keen,
With strongly moulded will has done
The great things we have seen ;
Already honored by the Throne,
Respected far and wide,
His boundless energy has thrown
All obstacles aside ;
New Zealand, deemed a place remote,
Scarce known across the sea,
Has prestige gained which must denote
A greater destiny.
In loyal tribute to your worth,
Sincere farewells we bring
To you and yours, who now go forth
As guests of England’s King.
And nobody laughed. There wasn’t a single howl
of merriment. The Jingo’s sense of humour is
apparently as dead as Jeroboam of Israel, the
Cow-worshipper.
* * » »
The British empire musters a population of a
little over 400,000,000. It is the biggest empire on
earth, and the Jingo says that in their adherence
to headquarters in London all these millions are
as solid as a rock. It contains more than a quarter
of the world’s population. In sheer brute force
of numbers it weighs far more than France,
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Italy,
Spain, Portugal, Russia, Turkey, Switzerland,
the Dauubian States, Norway, Sweden, and
Greece all put together. It should be able to
down any five of them, almost with one hand.
This Empire is at war with almost the smallest
white nation on earth. The Boers, all told, wouldn’t
make, in point of population, a city anything like
the size of Sydney. They would be almost lost
in an average London suburb. They amount
to less than one-third the number of passengers
that the railways of little Victoria carry in a
week. No question about the merits of the war
can alter the relative sizes of things. Yet Jingo
literature reeks with tear-sodden allusions to the
fact that the British empire stands alone against
this enemy. The Jingo has a choke in his voice
when he tells us this. He pictures the desolation
of the Grand Old Mother, weighing 18 stone,
stepping on a butterfly, with no one to help
her—no other 18-stone person to get on the
insect along with her. It is sad ! It is even
heart-breaking ! And it opens up new vistas of
thought. When Prussia and Austria combined to
squash microscopic Denmark between them in
1864, we can understand how their Jingoes
must have felt, because the other Great Powers
didn’t help them and they were left to flatten
out.their baby antagonist all on their own. Also
we begin to realise the feelings of the push when
18 pushites start, however j ustifiably, to kick one
small boy, and the callous multitude doesn’t
assist them worth a copper.
• * * *
And all this time the stupendous empire isn’t
alone at all. It has a friendly understanding
with the United States (population 78,000,000),
and the Jingoes assure us all the time that the
U.S. is a durable friend—so durable that the
re-union of the Anglo-Saxon race is quite a pro-
bable circumstance. It is on terms of friendship,
almost amounting to alliance, with Italy (popula-
tion, 33,000,000). It has a long-standing alliance
with Portugal. And it has a definite offensive
and defensive treaty with Japan (population
44,000,000). If the stupendous empire of 400,000,000
souls is attacked simultaneously by Denmark and
Bulgaria, this huge ally, bigger in itself than
France or the Austrian empire, is bound to assist
it. All this makes it difficult for any sane citizen,
with a shred of humor in his composition, to weep
in the same bucket with the Jingo, whose heart is
moved at the solitariness of that pathetic figure
which stands up at the left hand end of the map
of Europe, about longitude 0.
* * » *
And a few German, French and Austrian
newspapers have spoken unpleasantly about the
Empire, which was very like David cheeking
Goliath and all his big brothers at the same time.
And the humorless Jingo has published about 70
pamphlets, and 700 poems, and 70,000 speeches,
and 140,000 newspaper articles, stating that he
treats these jibes with the silent but d afening
contempt which they merit. The pathetic figure
of Poor Old Mother, 400,000,000 strong, being
basely and brutally trodden upon by some obscure
gutter journalist named Schmidt in a back street
of Berlin or Hamburg has been depicted, till the
figure whirled before our aching vision like a pano-
rama full of beer, and for weeks the Australian
and Maoriland public could hai'dly hear itself
think for the row that was made in coldly ignoring
these attacks.
* * * •
Truly, the Jingo at this end of the world is a
person who hasn’t a joke in his composition. His
depicting of the empire as the mightiest and most
durable and solidly-united concern that the
world ever saw; and his tears of pathos because
it hasn’t three or four more empires to help
it against a nation about the size of 2d. in
coppers; and his grief about its isolation ; and his
assurances that the U.S., 78,"000,000 strong, is
with us heart and soul in the cause of Anglo-
Saxon unity, and that our Jappy ally, 44,000,000
strong, is all there when he is wanted and can belt
the immortal soul out of anything his own size in
this globe ; and his proud cold indifference at the
top of his voice to the hostile criticism of base
parties who are beneath notice and who are actu-
ated by the worst motives—are all very amusing.
At the same time they are difficult to disentangle,
and suggest that persistent drinking of the Union
Jack is as demoralising as any other liquor.
J.E.
Bret Harte.
HAD Bret Harte died a decade or two ago
the event would have challenged world-
wide attention, for he then .stood as the
characteristic, representative American
writer. But he lived to lag superfluous on the
stage, and to see his fame eclipsed by, and for-
gotten in, the admiration of a new school of
letters. Harte was not one of those writers whose
work is “broad as the world,” touching the fun-
damental in human nature. If America has pro-
duced one such it was Nathaniel Hawthorne;
certainly the “Scarlet Letter” marks the pinnacle
of her literary achievement. Bret Harte was a
clever painter in genre, a bright describer of a
most interesting phase of human life. Because
his purpose was thus limited, his scope thus
narrow, he could never hope for immor-
tality ; the memory of his work was in-
evitably doomed to perish with the memory
of the temporary phenomena of human life
which he limned. And an unkind Fate shortened
the days of Fame which he might reasonably have
expected. A. new, more polished, more skiiful in
details, more broad in scope, race of writers
sprang up in America— genre painters also, but
with more cleverness in the use of their media if
less favored in their subjects—and the writer of
“ Roaring Camp ” was forgotten. As to whether
Bret Harte’s mining stories, or such books as
“ The Choir Invisible” and “David Harum” are
the better valued is purely a matter of individual
taste. They stand on the same plane as regards
Art—not the loftiest, still an exalted one. But
in 1902 there was no question as to relative popu-
larity : Bret Hart was a poor second. In liis
branch of achievement novelty is of great value.
The estimate of Harte’s worth as a writer was
more than generous 30 years ago : to-day it is less
than just, though it has not vet reached the depth
of depreciation in which Mark Twain openly
plunged Harte’s works. There is not likely to be
at any time in the future a corrected and truly-
balanced view. Harte has had his day, and will
quickly be lost in the darkness which envelopes
all writers except those of absolutely the first
order of genius. But in his time he amused many,
inspired many with love for a fresh, vigorous,
breezy, manly life, degenerating often into mere
vagabond lawlessness, but generally ennobled by
its love of liberty. There are many writers
who, with greater talents, did not so much.
England’s New Ally.
“ Japan, Our New Ally,” by Alfred Stead ; Fisher
Unwin, London.
“Japan,” by Mortimer Mempes.
JAPAN is now in everybody’s minds and
thoughts. As a feat in journalistic book-
publishing Fisher Unwin has, on sale in
Australia, in April, 1002, a book on Japan
written after the treaty of January, 1902. Mr.
Alfred Stead is the author, and his work is decent
journalism, giving a good idea of Japan’s political
and social life.
Mortimer Menpes’ work is more interesting,
shows closer observation, and touches the indus-
trial life of Japan, which is of more moment to
Australia. Some extracts
It was with a view to decorating my newly-built London
house that I paid a second visit to Japan, being convinced
that it was possible to handle labor there at a cheaper rate
and with finer results than in Europe. ... It was a
revelation to me, after my experience of British workmen,
to see the way these little Jap fellows toiled, how they
would talk and plan out schemes of decoration for me
among themselves, studying peony flowers, for instance,
in some celebrated temple-garden, in order to introduce a
new and more natural feeling into their modern ones ; and
then the joy with which they would think out every little
detail, flying around to my hotel at all times of the day to
inform me of some new departure, surprised and pleased
me greatly. . . . These men were all brilliant crafts-
men and designers, creating work that could not be
surpassed in Italy or anywhere else for beauty. Yet the
bulk of them were poorly fed, receiving only sevenpence
or eightpence a day. Too poor to buy meat, they lived
on rice and on the heads and tails of fish twice a' week,
being unable to afford that which was between. But,
although the Japanese workman is very poorly paid, it
must also be remembered that his necessities are few and
simple. This is roughly the way a workman in Japan
lives: He has one meal of rice per day of the poorest
quality, which costs him two sen eight rim. A sen is a
fractional part of a penny and a rim a fractional part of a
sen. For a mat to sleep on at night he pays one sen fifty
rim. Three sen he pays for fish or the insides of fowls,
drinking water costs him two rim, while two rim per day
pays for the priest. The total cost of his daily living thus
sums up into about five sen three rim. But,
although the coolie and workman in Japan live
on next to nothing, the rich man spends very
lavishly. If he entertains you, he gives you a dinner
which, although you seldom appreciate its splendid
qualities (for it does not appeal to the Western palate) is
from the Japanese standpoint truly regal” . .. .
“ Why in the world we do not use Oriental labour in
Europe is a marvel to me ” (p. 164).
And there will no reason in the world why greedy
capitalism shouldn’t employ it in Australia when
Mr. Barton has—under the influence of Mr.
Chamberlain—reduced his Aliens Immigration
Restriction Act to an absolute nullity.
Wordsworth on War.
The power of armies is a visible thing,
Formal and circumscribed in time and space ;
But who the limits of that power shall trace
Which a brave people into light can bring,
Or hide, at will—for freedom combating,
By just revenge inflamed ? No foot may chase,
No eye can follow to a fatal place
That power, that spirit, whether on the wing,
Like the strong wind, or sleeping, like the wind.
Within its awful caves. From year to year
Springs this indigenous produce far and near ;
No craft this subtle element can bind,
Rising like water from the soil, to find
In every nook a lip that it may cheer.
'A released British prisoner having stated that he
leard Gen. Botha recite this sonnet of Words-
worth to his officers, a “patriot,” whose two
sons have jobs in the Remount Department,
writes to an English paper urging that a stricter
censorship should be exercised over books going
to South Africa likely to encourage the Boers in
“ their futile and criminal resistance.”]
+. -
Nobody has yet explained why Australia should
get up on a rock in Sydney harbour and “ face the
dawn.” Her business lies the other way about—
right west. There is her duty to be performed,
there her obligations to be taken up, there her
destiny to be wrought out. And if any true
interpretative genius of sculpture should be dis-
covered iu the land, how absolutely would its con-
ception be opposed to the hackneyed idea of Mr.
O’Sullivan ? It would be of the Laocoon type.
Gigantic strength, limitless possibility, coiled
about and bitten into, fearfully constricted, hor-
ribly menaced. Yet, unlike the Laocoon, hopeful,
aye, confident still. Who knows not the serpents?
—drought and imported vermin ever tightening
their hold, ever-increasing landlordism, and mort-
gage bonds; hunger after slave labor, slavering
adulation, and hankering after old world curses
and frauds. They grip to the point of strangula-
tion ; they menace with a forest of forked and
slimy tongues. Yet the mastery is with Aus-
tralia if we fight on understandingly. Australia’s
hands are free yet, and keeping her head clear,
her eye clear, and her brow stern-set, she may
shake her whole body free within a generation.
But in that struggle she will gain nothing of help
or inspiration outside her own coasts.
Woman-missioner Balgarnie, now touring Aus-
tralasia, spoke to some purpose in Sydney the
other day :
She warned women against accepting lower wages than
men where they did the same kind of work. There were
women who were doing great harm to men and to women
by going but into the world and Working for a pittance,
which they used as pocket-money. That was the reason
why there was so much misery, and sometimes worse,
especially among girls themselves. If there was one
thing more than anothter which she sought to impress
upon young women it was that, in going out into the
world, they should remember the spirit of comradeship in
the whole body politic.
If those of her own sex would but take Miss
Balgarnie’s advice, there would be an enormous
increase in man’s respect for the “new woman ”
i.e., the woman who works as clerk or in some
other sphere once occupied by men only. For
man’s chief grudge against the woman, who doesn’t
want as an occupation to be a wife or mother, but
who aspires to an “ independent ” life, is that she
is a bad citizen, and a bad comrade. She works
longer hours for lower wages than her men-rivals,
and thus brings down wages, Then she in turn is
made the victim of the woman who doesn’t abjure
matrimony as a life-end, but, whilst she is waiting
for a husband in her father’s house, goes-out to
work of some sort just “to keep herself in
clothes, ” and is willing to accept a much lower wage
even than her independent sister (who must earn
food and clothing) can afford to accept. Woman,
in fact, comes into the industrial market willing to
sell herself cheaply, and absolutely careless of the
misery in which she involves her competitors by
cheerful submission to the sweater. She is man’s
enemy, as well as his victim, in that regard. Let
her brain learn to appreciate the laws of good
citizenship, of which the first and most important
is: “ Thou shalt not steal thy neighbor’s job,” and
man will welcome her as a fellow-worker and, in
time, perhaps relegate to her many employments
which now in male hands appear ridiculous. His
present objection is not to the working-woman,
but to the “blackleg” female friend of the sweater.

Some correspondents
J.R. : All right.
Reynardo : Morgan verse not of enough Austral
interest.
E.F. : Decide next week.
Monowai : Something was said in a recent Bulletin
(by Ambrose Pratt, 1 think) of the difficulty or futility of
sending Australian M.S. articles direct to English jour-
nals. Since February twelvemonth I have sent 15 or 16
articles to English editors (all quite unknown to me).
Macmillan’s accepted one, and sent me cheque for £7los.
I had courteous refusals from Longman’s, Cornhill, etc.
I then submitted several subjects to the editor of the
Nineteenth Century, who wrote selecting one. I wrote
the article, and after some months have just learned its
acceptance. Another article has been accepted by the
Spectator. This is enough to show that Australian
“ copy ” can find a market if one “ pegs away ” ; and
that the agent, however desirable, is not necessary to
salvation.

It signifies that Nature is crying
aloud for help, and saying
“ Your Liver is out of
Order.”
“Your Kidneys are not
doing their work.”
“Restore them to health or
your suffering shall not
cease.”
Nature invariably keeps her
word. She will not be outraged.
So long as the Urinary and
Biliary Poisons which cause
these diseases remain in the
system, health cannot be re-
gained. When the kidneys and
liver are fulfilling their ap-
pointed functions, the poisons
which cause these diseases are
expelled in a natural manner.

manently cure you, and one

The Case of
Mrs. E. WILLIAMS.
(by a special reporter.)
Our special recently saw Mrs. Emily
Williams, of No. 4 Yurong-street, East
Sydney, with reference to a matter of con-
siderable importance to the public. On
Mrs. Williams announcing that she had a
few minutes to spare, the following con-
versation took place :
Reporter : “ I desire to learn the exact
particu’ars about the troubles you ex-
perienced some years ago.”
Mrs. Williams : “ That is about the time
that I was so ill. Well, I hardly know
what to say to you, because my sufferings
extended over three years, and I could not
explain them in a few words.”
Reporter: “ I shall be all the more pleased
if you will go into detail.”
Mrs. Williams : “ Very well, then, I will
give the history of my case from start
to finish. r When my health began to fail I
noticed myself getting very languid and
drowsy, with a feeling as soon as I got up
in the mornings that I wanted to go back to
bed again, and not caring to do any work at
all. I thought that perhaps I was run
down through overwork, and that all I
required was a good rest, but after taking
matters very quietly for a while I found
that I was no better. The weariness was
still upon me, and my spirits were be-
coming more depressed every day. I did
not want to go out shopping or picnicing,
neither had I any desire for any amuse-
ment. There was no vitality in my body
to enable me to do anything, and many a
time I felt as if I could simply lie down
and die, as every pleasure in life went away
from me. Even the privilege of enjoying
my food was denied me, for my mouth was
thick with a bitter substance, which was
especially noticeable on my tongue, and
everything had a sickly taste. Besides, I
had no appetite worth mentioning, a couple
of mouthfuls always proving sufficient to
turn me away from the table in disgust, yet
in spite of the small quantity I had eaten
the pains I felt were something cruel.
Spasms of wind often bent me double, and
I felt as if I was smothering through
a heavy feeling in my chest. When the
food had been in my stomach a little while
it became sour, for I could taste it in the
wind which rose up and caused me to belch,
and soon afterwards I started to retch and
retch till everything was vomited back
again.”
Reporter : “ Those ailments were the real
secret of your weakness.”
Mrs. Williams : “ Beyond all doubt; and
1 did get miserably weak and thin, I can
tell you. From nine stone two pounds I
fell away to seven stone, so you may believe
that I was nothing but a living skeleton,
and my skin was quite shrunken and nearly
yellow. Such a drawn and haggard face I
had, too, clearly showing that I passed
many nights in sleeplessness and agony,
with my head aching incessantly till I
was nearly driven out of my mind. It
would not be correct to say that I never
slept, as I sometimes slumbered for three
or four hours right off; but what sort of
deep was it ? It was like an ugly night-
mare right through, for the dreams I had
actually frightened me when I thought of
them in my waking moments. How
wretched it was to be everlastingly think-
ing of some undefinable misery that was in
store for me—that I would never be well
and happy again. Why, my feebleness had
so far advanced that if I walked a few yards
I had to stand and rest till I felt able to go on
a little further, and frequently giddiness
overtook me so that I staggered as I walked.
Often and often my sight was almost gone,
as there was nothing before me but a black
mist which hung before my eyes, and when
such experiences were made all the more
terrifying by my heart palpitating and pain-
ing me I was afraid to walk any further
for fear that I might drop down dead. The
palpitations were so violent that I could
hardly get my breath, and my gasping was
always accompanied by excessive trembling,
for my nervous system was broken down
completely. Right under my shoulder
blades there was a sharp pain which hurt
me greatly, and about my loins there was a
never ceasing ache. Death would have
been welcome so that my privations could
have ended, but it was not to be that I
should die.”
Reporter: “You say you were lingering
for three years ; but surely you got some
relief occasionally ? ”
Mrs. Williams: “ The only relief I got was
when I bought my first bottle of Clements
Tonic, for when I had finished it I imagined
I felt somewhat comforted. It was a strange
sensation which came over me, and one
which left me in a state of doubt. I felt
slightly easier, but not sufficiently so to
make it clear that Clements Tonic would
save me, and I hesitated about getting any
more ; but when I remembered that the
advice and medicine given to me by four
doctors were ineffective, and that I had
taken numberless other medicines and
pills without my condition being improved,
I thought the only sensible thing I could do
was to get some more Clements Tonic. Be-
sides, I had read in the papers about a lady,
who had been an invalid like myself, having
been cured by Clements Tonic, and I
thought if it would cure her it would cure
me. And that is precisely how I was trans-
formed from a weak and dying mortal to a
strong and happy woman. It did not take
Clements Tonic long to arouse in me a feel-
ing of hunger, although I did not feel too
easy after my meals for several days, but
then the food commenced to digest, and my
tortures began to disappear. My chest felt
lighter, and the smothering sensation passed
away ; my stomach did not pain me with
spasms of wind, and my mouth was tho-
roughly cleansed. There was also some-
thing missing that had caused me a
great amount of anxiety.”
Reporter : “ What was that ? ”
Mrs. Williams: “The palpitation and
pains in my heart; and I am sure it is nob
necessary for me to say how devoutly thank-
ful I was to Clements Tonic for having done
me so much good already. It gave me such
sound sleep, too; for, with the removal of
my headaches, there was very little else to
keep me awake, as the pains in my shoulderß
had gone, and the aches which resulted
from weakness were driven out by the
strength which Clements Tonic infused into
my system. Such things as retching and
vomiting were soon remedied by Clements
Tonic, and my nervous system was bene-
fited by each dose of that medicine. The
purifying qualities of Clements Tonic were
demonstrated by the clearness of my com-
plexion, and its ability to mitigate pain was
really marvellous. All I have to say is, that
I owe my life to Clements Tonic; and, as
there are many sufferers who do not know
how to cure themselves, you can publish
this account of my recovery in any way it
pleases you.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Emily Williams, of 4 Yurong-street, East
Sydney, in the State of New South Wales,

Building Up
“Fortunately for me I was advised
to try Scott’s Emulsion ”
For those who have to fight against weak-
ness after disease, to fight against any form
of feebleness or ill condition of the body,
there is an ally to be had that wins the
struggle, no matter the odds :
“ 143, Waterloo Road, Lambeth,
“ London, England, April 15th, 1901.
“Dear Sirs,—Last December I had a
severe attack of hemorrhage of the right
lung, which lasted for several days. It was
necessary for me to keep very quiet and
still, as the least movement or exertion
brought on the hemorrhage again. I was
unable to take anything solid, and naturally
fell away very considerably. The prepara-
tions that were given me seemed to have
little or no effect, and I made scarcely any
progress towards recovery. Fortunately for
me I was advised to try Scott’s Emulsion,
being told it was one of the best things to

be had to build up the system. Wishing,
of course, to get strong again, I commenced
to take your preparation, and with the most
satisfactory results, for I soon began to gain
in both flesh and strength. Unlike plain
cod-liver oil—which I cannot take easily—l
found Scott’s Emulsion very agreeable and
palatable, and what is more, highly bene-
ficial. —Yours very truly,
“ (Signed) Charles Osborne.”
It is one of the prime qualities of Scott’s
Emulsion that it immediately enriches the
blood—thereby stopping all wasting ten-
dencies. You will understand how im-
portant this is when you remember that
waste is continuous in a state of disease and
must be stopped if there is to be a return to
health. Scott’s Emulsion promptly puts
an end to the wasting, and then begins the
work of rebuilding in the blood, in the
tissues, in the hones.
This it does with the cod-liver oil —blended
in our way with hypophosphites of lime and
soda. These elements apart or blended by
some process less matured than our own
will not procure you the same result. It
is for this reason that doctors recommend
Scott's Emulsion. It is obvious if any
kind of emulsion would do doctors would
pot, as they do daily in their practice,
prescribe Scott’s Emulsion !
When, therefore, it is a question with you
of building up after illness o f any kind, but
particularly after every sort of fevers, lung
troubles, and other exhausting illnesses, the
answer is as sure as the remedy—Scott’s
Emulsion. It upbuilds perfectly, man,
woman, or child.
To secure it, note that there is a picture on
the wrapper —a man carrying a big codfish.
If you have this picture on the wrapper of
the bottle you have the remedy you need.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

"Lil of the Creek.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hair as soft as the shiny silk crowning a dead old
fern,
Cheeks as pink as the bramble buds kissing the
brink of the burn :
Lil they call her, pet of the Creek. Her eyes
were ’possum-grey,
But never a spark of their leaping light came in a
sweetheart’s way.
Dashing Dick from the Midland runs, one golden,
windy day,
With eyes as bold as an eagle-hawk, came riding
coastward way.
He was straight in his saddle, and people turned
at sight of his handsome head,
“Got any good-looking girls to Jim,
his mate, he said.
“ Any girls ! ” Jim Connor laughed, as they can-
tered side by side,
“I’ll show you the prettiest girl on earth, albeit
the world is wide,
But she’s got a heart like a ten-inch nail; she’ll
neither love nor wed.”
“ Show me a girl who will not love; I’ll soon make
1 er ! ” Dick said.
Winds, all balmy with almond scent, blew from
the Tea-tree Creek,
Mists all purple with bush-fire smoke clung around
Roland’s Peak.
Over the tracks grey ground-larks skirled, clou' s
slept over the hill.
Gum leaves shivered away on the range ; magpies
sang with a will.
Lil walked by as they crossed the creek, first of a
chattering band,
A splashing pail of water held in each brown,
curving hand ;
They raised their caps; Dick’s eyes grew bright
as the gay group onward sped :
“May I have a drink from your pail, my girl ? ”
to Lil he softly said.
She steadied a bucket in either hand, and took a
backward pace, /
Smiled at Connor, and looked at Dick, and the
smile died from her face—
Her voice was sweet, her laughter clear, as she
opened her lips to speak :
“ There’s plenty more, my man,” she said, “ just
over there in the creek.”
They cantered on, Dick’s handsome face turning
a sullen red;
His voice was quick as he rode along; once he
turned and said,
“Is that the girl ? Upon my oath, she’s got a
pretty cheek ! ”
“Yes, that was Beauty,” Jim softly said. “Yes,
that was Lil of the Creek ! ”
Weeks went by like a flash of sun ; green haulms
yellowed apace;
And Dashing Dick, of Midland Runs, sickened
for Beauty’s face;
He who’d broken a hundred hearts, laughing,
then rode away;
Chained himself to a creek-side farm for a girl
who said him nay.
Her eyes showed never a trace of the love he’d
fain have had them show,
She did not want him, nor yet his love; she
laughed and told him so.
He hated her often, then loved her more, until
one glorious night
He took his horse from Connor’s sheds and rode
thro’ the waning light.
She was only a girl, and he a man, fine and stalwart
and tall,
Many a woman down there in the South gladly
came at his call;
His hope was high as he stretched his hands to
touch her curly head,
“I want you, Lil, I love you well —come to my
arms ! ” he said.
She stood upright in the open door; mopokes
mewed thro’ the night,
Above the gums on the dusky range the moon
rose full and bright;
“But I don’t want you nor your worn-out love;
ride home and right the dead,
There’s a girl down South with a boy of yours,
who was buried to-day,” she said.

The Drover’s Toast.
There is one long toast that the drover drinks
Whether fleece he drives, or hide,
And the toast he gives as the glass he clinks
Is the good dog at his side.
He’s the best of mates, and he’s worth two men,
And the drover knows full well, •
He’ll go till lie drops and then—well then •
He’d trot at his heels thro’ Hell.
So a health to the dog, and one for the pup,
(He sleeps in the trap just now)
Not a heel-tap, my lad, tip your glass right up
To the drover’s pal—Here’s how.
He is built all shapes and he’s called all names,
(And oft as not he’s a she),
And what he knows of the sheep and their games
Would fill a dictionary.
And whether lie’s Toby, or Toss, or Nell,
And whether it’s wool or meat,
He will work all day—and at night as well,
Till the pads wear off his feet.
So a health to the dog, and one for his mate
(She has pups to mind just now);
To a good trip back, and the homestead gate ;
To the drover’s pal—Here’s how.
ENVOI.
And perhaps when we cross the Great Divide
(Where the tracks are green alway)
We’ll find at our heels old Kitty and Clyde,
All ready for mustering day.

SATURDAY, MAY 24, 1902.
Factory Legislation.
This coming session, New South Wales is
promised an improved Factory Law. In
addition to many valuable provisions for
ensuring the health and comfort of em-
ployees, the proposed Act contains the germ
of the legal minimum wage principle, inas-
much as it prohibits the employment of
boys and girls without remuneration, under
pretence that they are learning a trade. It
is so far a minimum wage Bill that it specifies
2s. 6d. a week as the lowest rate to be paid
to the boy or girl employee. Also, as
regards women, boys and girls, it fixes 48
hours as a week’s work, makes provision for
overtime, and otherwise tries to do good in
its day and generation. It is not a minimum
wage law in the comprehensive sense of the
Victorian statute, which the Turner
Government enacted, but, in combination
with the Early Closing Act and the Con-
ciliation and Arbitration Act, it is a solid
and valuable evidence that the workers are
gaining ground. In Victoria, the temporary
Factory Act—the one which embodies the
minimum wage provision—expires this year,
and the Peacock Government is pledged to
secure its re-enactment. It will probably
carry out its pledge—there are some things
that even a Peacock Government dare not
leave undone. Moreover, the Victorian
Act has put up such a good record of general
usefulness, and there has been such a
remarkable growth of manufacturing in-
dustry during the years it has been in force,
that even the House of 48 Rich Landlords
has a difficulty in inventing plausible reasons
for its non renewal.
• • * *
Yet, while all these progressive measures
nan’t be too highly commended, the Labor
party in Australia is missing its opportunity
in a most regrettable fashion. It is missing
its opportunity so badly that most of what it
is now gaining will probably be lost again—
the minimum wage and the eight "hours
system both included. They are built on a
foundation of sand, and all present appear-
ances are against their permanence. The
Labor party tights valiantly enough against
its visible enemy—against the palpable Fat
Man of the land ; but meanwhile a much
more dangerous enemy is growing up, not
only without any attempt at resistance on the
part of the Laborists, but with their actual
connivance. And the apparent impossibility
of arousing the party to a knowledge of the
situation is the most gloomy feature of the
case.
* * * •
Last year the Commonwealth exported to
the outer world some £46,000,000 worth of
goods. It did this partly to pay for its
imports ; partly to pay interest on its foreign
debts, public and private. If it hadn’t bor-
rowed an immense amount more money
abroad it would have had either to greatly
reduce its imports or to export about
£56,000,000 worth. A country which is
deeply in debt to foreign creditors, and which
imports largely under the influence of a
Freetrade or insufficiently Protective system,
must export enormously to pay its interest
bill and to pay for its imports. And almost
everything it exports must be prod'iced so
cheaply that it can sell abroad in competition
with the cheapest rival producer. Wool is
mostly grown for export, therefore there is
no eight-hour system and no decent mini-
mum wage for the regular station employee,
and there is never likely to be. Dairy pro-
duce is largely raised for export, and the
dairy-farmer's employee works long hours
for short wages. Wheat is partly grown for
export, so the cookie's laborer works from
the rising of the jackass to the going down
thereof, and the domestic fowl is not awake
when he goes to his toil and is asleep when
he returns home again, and his wages are as
short as his hours of recreation. The man
who pursues the bullock that is frozen and
sent to London is not much better off. Among
these toilers the wool man has hitherto been
about the best remunerated, because for
many years the demand for the article he
produced was in excess of the supply, but
with increased competition wool prices have
diminished enormously, and his prospects
with them.
• * * •
The Labor party makes no very serious
attempt to deal with the hard case of
these workers. It can’t do it; by reason
of the country’s foreign debt, and its
large imports, their wages are ruled
by causes that are, to a great extent,
beyond its control. The same applies in a
less degree to coal, silver,, and gold-mining.
The coal-miner competes in the export market
against the cheap foreign miner, with his long
hours. Thesilver-miner is producing anarticle
of which the value abroad has dropped one-
half in the last 17 years, and in addition the
local mines are becoming less productive
year by year. The gold-miner at Bendigo is
dragging out for export purposes stone worth
6dwt. per ton, where he used to get out stone
worth 20dwt. Factory legislation is doing
much to ameliorate the condition of the com-
paratively small body of artisans who make
things for local consumption. As regards
the large body which makes things wholly or
partly for export, it can only help them in
matters which don’t seriously increase the
cost of production. High wages and reason-
able hours do increase the cost of production.
The man who gets 7s. a day may do half as
much work again as the man who gets
3s. 6d., but he can’t be relied upon to do
twice the work. In hardly a single instance
has the minimum wage law, or any other
measure which very materially assists the
worker, been applied to the man who makes
goods for export.
* * * *
This country’s foreign debt is increasing
much faster than its population. Con-
sequently, the interest is increasing, and
unless imports diminish steadily, which they
are not doing, the amount of goods produced
for export must increase. That means that
the proportion of low-wage toilers must in-
crease. It means that minimum wage laws,
and anti-sweating laws, and eight hour laws
must apply to a smaller and smaller propor-
tion of the population. If foreign debts and
the necessity for exporting interest continue
to grow at the rate they have recently main-
tained, a time will come when all these
beneficent laws will apply to such a small
proportion of the population that they may
almost as well be dropped in disgust. That
is what The Bulletin means when it says
that these beneficent ideas are built on sand.
A good deal may be done temporarily by
wise land laws and other means, but these
can only slightly diminish the cost of pro-
duction, and all the exporting industries
bring up finally against the great fact that
they have to produce as cheaply as their
cheap labor rivals, or else go under. And
what that kind of production means the pre-
sent state of many of these industries fully
reveals.
• * * *
Of course, the example of the United
States will be quoted as a proof that export-
ing industries may pay good wages and work
reasonable hours and so forth. But the
United States farmer gets nearly twice as
much produce out of an acre of soil as does
the farmer in barren Australia. The United
States manufacturer makes economies by
working on an enormous scale, and he can
only do that because he has the local market
strictly reserved to him by his tariff. And
the United States is not a case in point,
after all. If Australia imported nothing it
would still have to export more, proportion-
ately to population, than the United States
does, to pay interest on its public and private
foreign debts alone. Of all the countries in
the world, Australia is the one which is com-
mitted to grind hardest at producing cheap
goods for the foreign market. So far, it is
getting over the difficulty by constant bor-
rowing, and doesn’t produce all these cheap
goods. But if it continues raising loans at the
present rate for another dozen or twenty
years it will probably by that time have
worn out its welcome in the British money
market. Then it will have to settle down to
pay all its liabilities in low-wage products,
and its liabilities will be much larger than
they are now.
• • • •
The Labor party should be, above all
others, the anti-foreign-loan party, for every
£5,000,000 that is borrowed abroad is an
undertaking on the part of the Common-
wealth to pay some £165,000 more a year in
low-wage products. It should be, above all
others, the anti-importing party, for every
£5,000,000 that is imported is a pledge to
send away another £5,000,000 worth of low-
wage products in exchange. When the
agriculturist or pastoralist works for the
local market, the Labor party can compel
him to pay decent wages ; it only means
shutting out foreign low-wage imports and
making the population, in which the Fat
Man is a considerable feature, pay a little
more for its goods, and there is no reason
why the Labor party should grieve if the
■ Fat Man’s goods are a fraction dearer. But
supplying the foreign market, in payment of
interest on foreign loans, or in payment for
imports, means taking exactly the price
which the goods will bring, and they bring
just the price which the similar goods of our
cheapest nigger-wage competitor bring, and
the wages at thisendfix themselves according-
ly. If these wages are increased by any legal
process beyond the competition line, then the
export industry stops, and that means stop-
ping payment, and that means the beginning
of a smash of which no one can see the end.
The end might be the suspension of our Con-
stitution at the urgent demand of our foreign
creditors, and our reduction to the status of
a Crown colony with no Labor party and no
Labor legislation. And by reason of these
things the Labor party should be above all
others the Protectionist party in Australia.
If it can, by a tariff, shut out £20,000,000
worth of imports and manufacture these
£20,000,000 worth of goods locally in locally-
owned factories, then there is £20,000,000
worth more industry which it can control
—to which it can apply its minimum wage
law and its eight-hour system, and its
other beneficent legislation. And there is
£20,000,000 less of the kind of industry
that it can't control—£2o,ooo,ooo less of the
compulsory exporting industry in which
hours and wages are regulated by the hours
and wages of our competitors in outside
markets.
♦*• • •
Further, the Labor party should be above
all others the party which makes a heavy
absentee-tax an essential feature of its policy,
for rents and profits that go abroad are all
part of the great mass of outside liabilities
that have to be paid for with low-wage
exports. It should also be the party that
demands the establishment of a sinking fund
to repay the existing foreign debt. It wants
“Socialism in our Time,” and if this country’s
£200,000,000 worth or so of public works
belonged to the people instead of to the
British mortgagee, that would mean that the
share of every citizen would be £54, and of
every family of five £270. That would be a
good beginning of Socialism, especially as
that kind of wealth can’t be packed up in a
bag and taken away by the fat absentee, as
Government securities can. It is good to
keep an eye on the local Fat Man, who has
our house and our back-yard in pawn, but it
is much more essential to keep an eye on
the foreigner who has a mortgage on every
yard of our railways and telegraphs ; on our
roads, schools, gaols, public buildings, docks,
harbors, and all our properties. It is good
to legislate against the local sweater who
incites a girl to make. 565. worth of shirts
for a miserably inadequate wage ; but the im-
porter and the foreign money-lender compel
Australia to produce some £56,000,000 worth
of goods, mostly at sweating wages, for this
barren land can’t pay good wages, and still
send out any great mass of material that
will compete in the world’s markets
against all comers ; and they want much
closer and more anxious inspection. It
is a wise thing to pass legislation
tending to a more equal distribution of
wealth, but there must be wealth before it
can be equitably divided, and, by reason of
the great loan policy, there is very little
wealth of our own in Australia to divide
now.
* * * *
And if the Labor party can’t see these
things, then may the Lord help it, for all
its reforms are built on sand, and its policy
is written in water, and there is no per-
manence or stability in it, and it doesn’t
know when to come in out of the wet.
Australia’s Nobbled Son.
~ , . ~ _ . . .
Ihe other day certain respectable Greek mum-
grants—respectable so far as the possession of cash
guarantees anybody’s respectability—were turned
back at Aibury for not bemg acquainted with the
English language. Wherefore, it would seem that
Pekicles is at a discount in Australia, and
Demosthenes is off, and Epaminondas is not
what he is cracked up to be. Recently a Portu-
guese sailor at Newcastle received an utterly
brutish sentence of six months hard labor for not
knowing English, and the ghosts of ttie old
Portuguese sea-kings who mapped out the coast
of this unknown land in the dark ages must have
sat up in their graves when they heard the news.
Certain Italian immigrants, whose ancestors,
carrying the eagle of the Tenth Legion, landed in
England without any language test 1950 years ago
have also been in trouble recently for not knowing
English. Meanwhile every oily and blastiferous
nigger who does know English is allowed to
come in freely, and it is time Australia knew the
reason of this. Premier Barton— Australia’s
Nobbled Son—who is the responsible party, lias
gone to England, but his locum tcnens, Attorney-
General Deakin, is here to answer questions.
And if Parliament does its duty there will either
be a great and sudden change in the order of
things, or else a cablegram will overtake Premier
Barton before he reaches London telling him
that he needn’t go on to the Coronation for he is
Premier no longer.
• • * *
Everyone knows that the Aliens Restriction
law was passed to keep out black and brown immi-
grants, with whom the white Australian can’t
intermarry without mongrelising his race. That
fact was emphasised sufficiently to make it quite
certain that no member of the Ministry is unaware
of it. The Act does not profess to shut out black
men, but men who can’t write 50 words in some
European language—this at the instance of Joe
Chamberlain, who urged Australia, while reserv-
ing power to shut out colored races, not to openly
cast a slur on the niggers of the empire. He
urged Australia to consider the feelings of the
survivors of the Sepoy mutineers and of
their descendants, and to exclude them surrep-
titiously, and he broadly hinted that no other
measure would be allowed to pass. The law, if
honestly administered by a reliable statesman,
which Premier Barton is not, is comprehensive
enough to answer every purpose for which it is
intended. All it wants is proper administration.
Premier Barton has turned it, or allowed it to be
turned, into a shameful deception and an engine
of tyranny which promises_ to make Australia a
bye-word. Under his administration it has become
a means of letting black men in and keeping
white men out. The British have been the
dominant race in India for nearly 150 years; their
language is known to some millions of the popu-
lation of India, and the proportion which knows
it is constantly increasing. By selecting English
as the European language which is to be used as
the test, when there was no legal need to do so,
Premier Barton deliberately threw Australia
open to enough niggers to swamp its white
population three times over. And by mak-
ing English the test European language when
there was no legal need to do so, Premier
Barton deliberately shuts out the bulk of the
white men of the globe. He calls on the
black man to pass a test in what, in many cases,
is almost his own language—and he gets in. He
calls on the white man, not only to pass a test
which is not compulsory, but to pass it in a foreign
language, and the white man gets into gaol for six
months !
* * * *
The black and brown men can be kept
out without any semblance of injustice by
sending an intimation to the Indian and other
Asiatic authorities, and to all shipping com-
panies trading with Asiatic ports, that it is
no use for colored immigrants to. come here, as,
under the Act, they won’t be allowed to land—in
other words, that the Act will be so interpreted
as to shut them out every time. That has cer-
tainly not been done. Nor has any intimation
been sent to the white nations of Continental
Europe that their subjects are going to be tested
in a foreign language, and either sent back or put
in gaol if they don’t know that language. There
are probably six times as many English-speaking
black and brown people in India and Japan as bn
the Continent of Europe, and in the way Premier
Barton has chosen to administer the Act, it will
probably shut out six white Europeans to one
nigger. This is not saying that Julius Peanut
Caesar and Miltiades Corinth Phriedfish are
necessarily desirable immigrants—but they are
white at all events.
* * * *
It is openly declared that this amazing line of
action was adopted out of regard to the secretly-
expressed request of Joe Chamberlain, or is
done in obedience to his known but unexpressed
wishes. Australia gave way to the wishes of Joe
Chamberlain before, for a price. It reckoned it
wa3 better to accept the present Aliens Restric-
tion Act, which can be made to fill all require-
ments, than no Act at all, so it got the present
Act as the price of its surrender. But it gets
nothing as the price of this new surrender. If
Premier Barton gets anything—a title, or some
similar trash—he should pay for it himself, not
pay at Australia’s expense. Australia has some
claims on Premier Barton. It found him. a tired
and none-too-successful lawyer, and a. desperately
unsuccessful politician—a man who had never
even risen to a State Premiership, who
had wandered round four constituencies seek-
ing a precarious Assembly seat, and whose
whole Ministerial experience covered a period of
a year or two all told. It gave him the highest
office in the Commonwealth, over the heads of
such tried and veteran democrats as George Tur-
ner and C. C. Kingston. It has found him
weak, wavering, futile, incompetent—and ap-
parently a traitor to boot. No one knows better
than Australia’s Nobbled Son the aspirations of
this country after a purely white race in a white
man’s land. The black influx leads to only two
alternatives; either the two races must inter-
marry and the white man become a mongrel and a
thing for Kipling to jeer at, or else a scorn and
loathing of the black race must arise strong
enough to keep the two communities apart —as they
are kept apart in the Southern States of America
by lynch murder, outrage and lawlessness. Aus-
tralia wants none of this —not even to get Edmund
Barton Imperial favor. Therefore it is time
Australia sent him back to private life —this time
for good. Apparently he is doing Chamberlain’s
work, not Australia’s, and Chamberlain should
pay him. As head of the Commonwealth he
grows a worse failure every day. And every day
The Bulletin is more and more pleased to recol-
lect that Kingston was its nominee all the time
for the Federal Premiership, and that the eleva-
tion of Australia’s Nobbled Son was none of its
doing.
The Sabbath Banana.
The Sabbath banana, after many vicissitudes in
N.S. W. is at last to come before the court of Parlia-
ment for a definite verdict. For years this fruit
has been a stumbling-block in the way of poli-
ticians. It has been feebly abolished for a week
or two at most, when a Cabinet thought the
placation of the sourly-religious a necessity, and
again it has triumphantly flaunted itself in the
face of the Evangelical Council, and given refresh-


ment to the Sunday tripper unabashed. Its title
of “Sabbath banana” it owes to the Evangelical
Council; as a matter of actual fact it is the
Sunday banana, and on the Sabbath (Saturday),
which the Jehovah of the Old Testament ordained
that the Jews should keep as a day free from trade
and labor, the humble fruit has always been sold
without question. But it is part of the policy
of the extreme Sabbatarians to confuse the
Jewish Sabbath, and the ordinances relating
thereto, with the Christian Sunday, about the
observance of which the Scriptures are silent.
Whether it be Sabbath banana or Sunday banana,
however, it is to come, so Premier See promises,
before N.S.W. Parliament for review early in the
approaching session.
* * • •
The decision of the legislature, it is to be hoped,
will be arrived at, without reference to the preten-
sions of little groups of pietists to dictate rules of
conduct for the general community, and solely
with a view to public convenience and public inte-
rest. Moses, the Solon of Israel, was a wise
man, who had had experience in Egypt of one of
the most soulless sweating schemes of the world’s
history. He had seen his Jewish compatriots
ground to the very dust that they might rear
Pyramids for the ruling caste on the banks of
the Nile. Moreover, he had been familiarised
with the great religious holidays of the
Egyptians, in honor of Isis, Bacchus,
Artemis, Minerva and other gods, holidays the
frequency of which Herodotus comments upon.
And, in the light of his experience and of his know-
ledge, he instituted the Sabbath, ostensibly for
religion’s sake; probably, in his secret heart,
actuated solely by considerations of public health
—physical and mental. It was, anyhow, a noble
idea—that of fixing a rest-day from labor, when
tired muscles might find relief and fagged Nature
recoup herself. Christianity, whilst showing a
marked hostility to many Jewish observances, was
either unwilling or unable to abolisli the weekly
rest-day, but changed its incidence from Saturday
to Sunday, and relaxed somewhat the rigor of the
rules against work of a recreative character. With
the 18th and 19th centuries the Day of Rest came
into conflict with the development of modern
civilisation. People found it necessary to travel
oh Sunday ; certain machinery had to be kept
going ; a thousand and one of the processes of a
complex social organisation could not be stopped
for the sake of a general holiday. But the
idea was still tenaciously held of one day’s rest to
follow six days’ labor. Religious sentiment
ordained that, as fa r as possible, the rest day should
be Sunday, and humanitarian sentiment decreed
that for those who had to work on Sunday there
should be some other holiday.
* * • •
With that, the attitude of reasonable men, there
can be no quarrel. It would be deplorable if the
Rest. Day should be abolished entirely, and
deference to the religious views held by the
majority of civilised white men suggests that, so
far as it is reasonably possible, the day of relief
from labor should be Sunday. But when the com-
munity interest demands from some section of
workers toil on that day for the benefit of the rest
of the people, the “Sabbath ” of that section must
be some other day than Sunday. That principle
defines the range of Parliamentary inquiry into
the Sunday labor question. If the public good
demands that there shall be Sunday trams, trains,
ferries, cabs and busses, that certain shops and
institutions shall be open for the community’s
refreshment or education —and it is generally con-
ceded that such is the case—then the servants of
travel, the keepers of refreshment shops, the
attendants of libraries or art galleries, must be
given the same permission to work on Sunday as
is accorded to the man who preaches and the man
who passes the plate in a church. Community
interest, and that alone, should decide in each
case. The “ religious argument ” must be put out
of court.
• * * *
It cannot be otherwise. So soon as the
“religious” advocate admits the propriety of the
Sunday tram and the Sunday cook and coach-
man, and the Sunday collection, he strikes his
colors, abandons any possibility of appeal in
the matter to a Divine authority, and con-
demns himself to come down to argue on
the plane of pure reason. And on that
plane his opposition to the Sunday banana
cannot but seem to be mere cantankerousness—
that malicious desire to be unpleasant to fellow-
mortals which has been noted as a characteristic
of pietists by many historians in addition to
Macaulay. Therefore let the Evangelical Council
declare for a Jewish Sabbath, if it honestly
believes that the Lord ordained a day of absolute
rest and ordained that it should be Sunday, the
first day of the week ; let it declare for a Sabbath
on which no fire shall be lighted and no food
prepared, which no man shall violate by a journey,
no physician by a healing, no steamer by a piston-
throb, no gas-works by a jet of light—a Sabbath
of darkness, of hunger, of stagnation and of
prayer. That is what God ordered if He ordered
anything. If He didn’t order anything, and the
day of rest is a human institution, only Divine in
so much as it tends to the elevation and ennoble-
ment of mankind, the law should consider the con-
venience of man, and that alone, in regard to
Sunday labor.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The British Uni-Cameral System.
This brilliant remark is taken from Launceston
(Tas.) Examiner :
The bicameral system of Government has stood the test
of centuries. It is adopted in nearly every civilised coun-
try, and only in a few American States has that of a single
House been tried. It has not proved a success in those
instances, and therefore it would be imprudent to rush
into an experiment which is risky and which is not
required. The Legislative Council in Tasmania has done
good work, and while it may sometimes have stood in the
way of progress it has, on the other hand, prevented the
passing of much hasty and ill-digested legislation.
This grotesquely-ignorant paper makes a slight
mistake —it is in a few Canadian provinces, not
American (which term always means U.S.) States
that the one-House system has been tried. And
it has answered so well in one respect that Ontario
and Manitoba are almost the only two provinces
in the whole British dominions that have no debt.
The principal sections of the British empire which
are governed by one House of Legislature only,
are six of the Canadian States, Malta, Ceylon,
Cyprus, Hong Kong, Mauritius, St. Helena, Gold
Coast, Lagos, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Falkland
Islands, British Guiana, Honduras, Jamaica,
Trinidad, Grenada. St. Vincent. St. Lucia, India,
. and the Straits Settlement. The fact that in most
cases the one House is nominee, or mostly
nominee, makes no difference in the fact that the
uni-cameral system is by far the most common
throughout the Empire. It also prevailed for a
long time in Australia, and the extreme Tory
party fought hard to retain it. The extreme Tory
party has always believed in government by one
House of Legislature only, so long as that House
was exclusively a House of rich property-owners.
It is certainly a bitter opponent of government by
one popularly-elected House, but when it is
in exclusive possession, its faith in the allegedly
non-British uni-cameral system is such that it
couldn’t be dragged away from it by a team of
bullocks. As regards the merits of Upper Houses
in preventing the passage of ill-digested legisla-
tion, it is equally true that they have, by their
sloth and incapacity, prevented the repeal of much
ill-digested legislation, some of which has refused
to digest even after being on the statute-book for
50 years. _ On the other hand, the list of hasty
and ill-digested Loan Bills which the Upper
Houses of this country have passed is terrible to
contemplate.

Exit Hopetoun.
The resignation of Governor-General Hopetoun,
who abandons his post because the salary of
£lO,OOO a year is utterly inadequate, and because
the Barton Government’s proposal to add £BOOO
to it fell through, is another example of Australia’s
tendency to do things on too large a scale. The
inflated idea of its own wealth, which it acquired
among the easily-made fortunes of the gold-boom
days, and the land-boom days, and the early lo in-
boom days, and the inability to realise that in the
way of permanent resources it has very few,
prevent it cutting its Governor-General according
to its cloth. Also, foolish little parochial
jealousies get into the road. The Governor-
General has to be in Melbourne while Parliament
sits there, and, when Parliament shifts to the
permanent capital, he will have to be in Bombala,
or wherever that capital is. He dqgs no good to
Melbourne while he is there, nor would he do any
good to Sydney if he were there, but he has to be
in Melbourne. Therefore Sydney has now a
chance to turn a very expensive Government
House to some practical and profitable use, as a
building that is too vast for a mere State Gover-
nor, and to get rid of a very costly incubus. There
is no reason why a palace should be maintained
for the Governor-General at every State capital,
any more than there is why Edward VII. should
have palaces at Liverpool and Manchester and
Belfast, and all over the place, or why the U.S.
President should have a separate White House in
each of the 44 States of the Union. There is no
reason, either, why a poor, limp, pale viceroy
should be expected to make regular progresses at
huge expense over a great part of this big con-
tinent, taking with him his suite and his brass
band. Sydney may be indignant that he should
stay all the time in Melbourne, but still there will
be a long line of Governors-General in New South
Wales, and it is foolish to cry for the moon and
expect it to be delivered immediately. When it
is enough for the United States, with its popula-
tion of nearly 80,000,000, that its President should
have one official residence in a second-rate city,
and should do any necessary entertaining there,
and New York and Philadelphia and Chicago
pull through, even if he doesn’t wander
through them periodically, ; and when Canada,
with over 5,000,000 people, is content that its
Gov.-General should have one official residence at
Ottawa, and hardly even call in at the big cities,
and do no entertaining worth speaking of—Aus-
tralia, with its 4,000,000 people, should be
able to do with the same kind of arrange-
ment. At present the Governor - General
is a miserable person, torn by conflicting
emotions. The Labor party rightly blocks
any increase of his stipend, holding that
£lO,OOO a year is more than ample for all
business purposes, and it only wants him for
business purposes. Certain other parties, how-
ever, demand that he shall be a circus and a
travelling show, humping at enormous expense
the pomp and glory of his establishment round
the continent, and entertaining at various cities;
and anyone who likes to consult Fitzgerald
Brothers as to the travelling expenses of a circus,
including feed for the animals, will find that it
can’t be done for the money. Australia has not
much more population than Switzerland, and a
section of its governing class wants to do things
with the pomp of the Russian empire and twice
the pomp of the United States. Hopetoun’s
departure makes no difference to Australia. It is
merely a case of exchanging one pale and amiable
rubber-stamp for another. But the country
doesn’t want a long series of foolish, squalid rows
with its official rubber-stamps, because the
haughty clique which dines and dances at
Government House clamours for the introduction
of a circus element into- the gubernatorial office,
and is mad in its paltry little soul because one
city sees more of a certain ordinary-looking man
than another. If the clique which insists on the
Governor-General travelling round to give it
dinners at the various State capitals won’t pass
the hat and make up the necessary amount itself,
it deserves to dine at a sixpenny restaurant. If
it makes much more trouble, it will deserve to
dine at a fourpenny restaurant.
The Governor-Generalship.
The chief regret arising from the resignation of
Lord Hopetoun as Governor-General of Australia
will be because of its reason. Some three months
ago His Excellency assumed to his office powers
and privileges which in no wise belonged to it, and
which he could only exercise in defiance of the
Federal constitution and of every tradition of free
representative government. Parliament then
made a protest, a feeble protest it is true, but
still a protest, pointing out to the Governor-
General that it was neither within his privilege to
act as a public apologist for his Ministers, nor
within his power to usurp the position of a consult-
ing member of a small Cabinet junta to shape the
military and foreign policy of the Commonwealth.
The occasion of that protest should have been the
occasion of Lord Hopetoun’s resignation. The
refusal of the powers he then claimed was of
infinitely greater importance than the refusal of a
salary-increase of £BOOO or even £BO,OOO a year.
But the timorous fashion in which Parliament
made its protest gave Lord Hopetoun an excuse for
ignoring it, of which excuse he availed himself. The
refusal of a salary accretion has now been made
boldly and definitely, and Lord Hopetoun “gives
notice” boldly and definitely. He would have
consulted his own dignity better, and the interests
of Australia would have been better advanced,
had the resignation come hard upon the first
rebuff. The Governor-General would have cut a
better figure resigning on constitutional grounds ;
and Australia would have been better served by the
next Governor-General having it made quite clear
to him that no active interference on his part with
the Government of Australia will be tolerated.
As things stand, the chief point impressed upon
the new-comer will be that he is not to expect
more than £lO,OOO a year. United with regret
that this point, and not the constitutional one, is
the reason of Lord Hopetoun’s resignation will
naturally be some feeling of disappointment at
losing the services of a gentleman who, as a
figure-head, was always amiable and dignified,
and as well fitted as anybody that could be
imagined to act as the ornamental rubber-stamp
of the Australian legislature.
The Pomp of War.
Commonwealth Defence estimates are to be
cut down from £960,000 to £820,000, and the
absurd Victorian navy with its antiquated Cer-
berus and obsolete guns (or whatever they are
called) is to suffer £15,000 of that difference. Not
a day too soon, either ! The Cerberus was origi-
nally “lent” by the Admiralty to Victoria on
condition that the old tub was to be returned as
soon as it was pronounced inefficient by the
admiral on the station. For years successive
admirals have annually inspected it and reported
it efficient, though not one of them would have
ventured to take it into a fight of the very smallest
kind. Victorian politicians have come to regard
the Cerberus as a sort of fetish, and have stuck to
it, though they know, and have known all along,
that it is no better than a useless and expensive
toy. But that .£15,000 will be a mere drop in the
bucket. The Dept, has also stopped recruiting
for all the Commonwealth army—at any rate the
part of it that is paid. What is to be done about
the huge overpaid staff does not appear. As an
example of what that is like, here is Brigadier
Finn’s staff in Sydney: -
1 Assistant Adjutant-General, 2 Deputy Assistants, 1
Assistant Quartermaster-General, 1 Officer Commanding
Artillery, 3 Staff Engineers, I Military Secretary, 1 Chief
Clerk, 1 Commissary-General of Ordnance, 2 Aides-de-
Camp.
Now here is the staff an English Brigadier would
have:
1 Brigade Major, 1 Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-
General, 1 Commanding Engineer, 1 Officer Commanding
Artillery.
That would be all, and no aide-de-camp allowed.
The army in Australia is a mere pretext for giving
military titles to a few socially influential persons
and allowing them to dress in gold-laced clothes.
If there are only 10 men and a bugle-boy to a regi-
ment there will be just as many colonels and
majors as if there were 1000.

The Logic of Politics.
Mr. Bruce Smith, M.H.R., has been lecturing to
a Sydney suburban School of Arts on “The Logic
of Politics,” giving his hearers a rehash of Her-
bert Spencer—with all the meaty bits left out.
In his first and most vigorous work Spencer de-
clared for pure individualism, compulsory
nationalisation of the land and republicanism.
The Tories who use the great philosopher’s brain
to buttress up their cause nowadays ignore all the
inconvenient parts of “Social Statics.” A slab
of Mr. Smith’s emasculated Spencer :
The legislation of to-day, instead of teaching people to
rely on themselves, to be independent of others, to
grow up self-reliant and in the self-helpinir spirit of our
forefathers, endeavors to satisfy every whim and fancy of
the thoughtless who cry out like children to be provided
for. The English Parliament originally guaranteed every
man his fullest liberty, so long as he did not interfere
with that of others. Now it transgresses our liberties by
such laws as early closing, Sunday restriction, compul-
sory arbitration. Again, Parliament secured to everyone
his own legally acquired savings or production ; but to-
day it enforces contributions or taxes from about one-
third of the population, and uses them not for the legiti-
mate purposes of security from outside aggression in
army and navy, and not for securing the peace of the
community by judiciary and police, but by giving away
to men who do not contribute to the taxation a higher
wage than they could possibly earn in the open market,
by carrying out public works by day labor, instead of
contract, at the cost of the taxpayer, by paying out of
the people’s taxes the price of old-age pensions. All the
taxation that is necessitated by these forms of charity is
to that extent a transgression of the principle of securing
to everyone the free use of his own belongings.
Mr. Bruce Smith’s knowledge of constitutional
history is simply deplorable. The English Parlia-
ment has in past ages interfered very remarkably
with the liberty of the subject—by, for instance,
laws keeping the wages of agricultural laborers at
a low limit and forbidding workmen to form trade-
unions. So long as the rich kept the political
power in their own hands they used it freely to
prevent the poor from having any industrial free-
dom. It is only now, when the poor have gained
some political power, that the rich find it is against
“ the logic ” of politics for Parliament to interfere
as regards wages and hours of labor. When the
Black Death made workmen scarce in England
the landlords’ Parliament punished with torture
men who tried to take advantage of the prevailing
scarcity to demand higher wages. That was
guaranteeing “the fullest liberty.” But a Fac-
tories Act to prevent the murderous sweating of
the poor is “against logic.” Similarly, when,
during the Bank crisis in Australia, the N.S.W.
Government rushed to the rescue of tottering
capitalists, the fatted Tories uttered no word of
protest; they had forgotten all about their “ indi-
vidualism,” but now calmly revive it to utter a
solemn warning against granting 10s. a week to the
decrepit poor who have outlived their work-use-
fulness. It is a poor sort of logic that won’t work
both ways, and that’s the Bruce Smith sort. To
help the undeserving rich is statesmanship ; to aid
the struggling poor, socialism and tyranny. That’s
the Smith “ logic ” in a sentence.
4 —:
The Tory Person’s Cheek.
In political matters the Tory person has no grati-
tude, and not much truth, and exceedingly little
sense, but he has enough cheek to make up for all
other deficiencies. For instance the name and
address of A. W. Pearse, of Spring-st., Sydney,
appear under this in Brisbane Courier :
The result of all the so-called social legislation has been
an unmitigated failure ; instead of bettering the condition
of the whole of our working-classes it has benefited a few
to the ruin of thousands. The one fact alone of Govern-
ment railways, and refusals to grant concessions to pri-
vate persons, has closed the largest avenue for employ-
ment. It has led to one large monopoly of an out-of-date
railway system, and has blocked the opening! up of the
country. It has handicapped our producers with high
rates, and has saddled the community with a so-called
asset which, unless a similar monopoly were granted,
would not bring two-thirds of its cost in the open market.
Fancy any sane man propounding, and professing
to believe, that Government railway-building has
“ blocked the opening up of the country ”!! Ye
gods !! And the Australian Governments have
opened up the country with State railways so
liberally that, in proportion to population, Aus-
tralia has more railway than any other land on
earth. It is better supplied with railways per
head than even the United States, or Canada, or
Argentina, and they did not get even the
much smaller supply they have through
private enterprise, but because the U.S. Govern-
ment aided the companies with 212,000,000
acres of land-grants and much cash assistance as
well, and the Argentine and Canadian Govern-
ments were quite as lavish. In the liberality of
its opening up Australia is miles and miles
ahead of every country where Private Enterprise
was not bolstered up by State aid, and it
is far better supplied than any country where
Private Enterprise received State aid. Its lines
were built at a less cost per mile than
those of any other countries in the world bar
Scandinavia, Chili, and possibly Brazil and the
Transvaal. As regards the alleged refusal to
grant railway concessions to private companies,
where are the private companies that are
willing to build railways unless the Govern-
ment pays practically the whole costinland-grants?
Westralia couldn’t get private enterprise to build
a mile of line except by enormous bribes in land
and cash assistance on top of that. Then it got
high fares, ramshackle lines and slow trains, dirty
carriages, and a policy of locking up the co.’s land
grant which blacked all settlement. The
Tasmanian Main Line, when in private
hands, had enormous fares and rolling-stock
that smelt like Chinatown. The privately-owned
Emu Bay line doesn’t pay, and it charges about
three times the rates charged by Government.
The Wellington-Manawatu line (M.L.) lives
chiefly on its State land grant. S. A. has just
taken over the private Glenelg railway, and given
an improved service at a third less cost. Queens-
land offered immense land grants tp private
capitalists if they would build railways, and
nobody came forward. Tasmania has been
waiting six years or so for its great
Western syndicate to really start building
that line, and Private Enterprise won’t
move. Private Enterprise evidently doesn’t feel
in the least like building railways in a thinly-
peopled and barren land such as Australia is
—excepting in a very few favored spots. In
fact, State control only began in Australia because
Private Enterprise, which had the first show, gave
it up. It was always a poor, cadging impostor
crying on the State door-mat for land-grants and
assistance and concessions. And it was dirty and
extortionate as well as an impostor. What old
Melbournian doesn’t remember the Hobson’s Bay
Railway Co., which had the most thickly-peopled
section of the State to work upon, and charged 50
per cent, higher fares than the State, and supplied
carriages that looked like the State’s cattle-trucks !
♦
Senator Millen, of N.S.W. presented the
Parliament with about the most ludicrous reason
yet invented for not paying our debts. He said
that it was foolish and wasteful to attach a sinking-
fund to Federal loans, because “for every £1
raised towards the sinking-fund, it was necessary
to raise £4 by taxation.” The much more valuable
idea that the Federal Government should pay its
way out of taxation and have no loans at all,
because “ for every £1 raised to pay interest on
loans it was necessary to raise £4 by taxation,” of
course, didn’t get a mention. Also Mr. Millen’s
statement was quiteuntrue; if the Federal Govern-
ment wants to raise an extra £1 by customs and
excise taxation, over and above the £2,200,000 or so
which it has already, it will certainly have to levy
£4 extra, and give back the other £3 to the States ;
but it can raise money by any other form of tax
and keep the lot. In any case, the Braddon
clause is only fixed for 10 years. Among all these
matters, Mr. Millen’s reason for not paying our
debts ought to be sent to Callan Park Asylum, or
to the Home for Aged and Decayed Superstitions.
-*•
Adelaide Advertiser, the organ of the wealthy
S’langdon Bonython, has now definitely turned
dog on the workers. When Kingston was at the
height of his power in S. A., and was bitterly op-
posed by the Tory gang and The Register, Bony-
THON’s paper made itself immensely popular with
the masses by barracking for Kingston and his
followers. In those days there was a Liberal
majority even in the Leg. Council, and such
measures as Early Closing, Household Suffrage,
Factory Law Reform, and Closer Settlement were
main planks in the Advertiser policy. Eventu-
ally Bonython—owing entirely to the persistent
worrying of Gov. Buxton and the Colonial Office
by Kingston and Agent-General Cgckburn—was
knighted. With Kingston’s translation to Federal
office the Advertiser made a marvellously rapid
right-about-face. It was an enthusiastic sponsor
for the Snow tram-grab from beginning to end,
and last December sided with the Tory crowd in
the effort-—only too successful—to place a majority
in Adelaide municipal council in favor of that
monstrous job. The climax was, however, reached
at the recent S. A. elections. Whilst the Tory gang
was lavishly spending money to secure the elec-
tion of Ass. candidates, and the Register was
daily slandering the workers, the Advertiser
remained dumb as an oyster. Such Liberal pro-
posals as early closing, closer settlement, wages
boards and household suffrage were never even
mentioned by Bonython’s treacherous print, and
the Labor party was left to battle on its own.
S.A. Leg. Council now contains 13 Tories in a
House of 18, and only three Labor men were re-
turned on May 3. The defection of the Adver-
tiser and the rail-sitting attitude of the Jenkins
crowd have had much to do with this result.
The return of a travelling Australian Commission
with the report that, in Maoriland, it found, for
the first time in its life, a country with no unem-
ployed, has set the Tory press explaining very
hard indeed. Its great anxiety now is to make it
quite clear that the State land bank, the graduated
land-tax, the absentee-tax, the labor legislation,
the breaking-up of big estates to make room for
small proprietors, the perpetual lease system, and
other such things, have nothing at all to do with
the matter, and that it all arises out of frozen
meat. There is a really wonderful unanimity
about this meat explanation. For instance,
Adelaide Register makes everything quite clear
in this wise :
In the great Southern colony (Maoriland), prosperity is
peculiarly due to a marvellous development of an export
produce trade.
Yet, with all the marvellous development of the
produce trade, Maoriland exports less, in propor-
tion to population, than Westralia, S.A., New
South Wales, or Queensland, which latter is in a
ghastly state of poverty. It exports less per head
than the Commonwealth taken as a whole. It
exports less per head than it did 30 years ago,
when it wasn’t feeling at all well. Maoriland is
a country with practically no unemployed, and
one which is attracting more immigrants than the
whole Commonwealth put together; and it is
also the most advanced country, in the socialistic
sense, in the world. The struggles of the Tory
press to put this all down to meat, and to prove
that there is no relation at all between Maori-
land’s prosperity and its legislation, are uphil
work.
Another man from the North :
The pearling industry of Torres Straits will not be
ruined by the removal of the floating stations owned by
one or two syndicates to Merouke, in Dutch New Guinea;
and, what is more, this matter of removal by these very
same floating stations will not have a disastrous effect on
Thursday Island. What it will have, will be the very
best thing that ever happened, or could happen, to
Thursday Island, and in the interests of Australia as a
whole. These floating stations cannot work the Torres
Straits shell-beds from Merouke under any other laws
than those of the Commonwealth. I invite your atten-
tion to the geographical position of these vast shell-beds.
They extend from Princess Charlotte Bay to Cape York,
and from there to British New Guinea. You will, by the
careful perusal of a really good map, see that the three-
mile limit prevents anyone but licensed pearlers under
Commonwealth laws from fishing or diving and procuring
shell from the sea-bed. This three-mile limit applies to ail
islands under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth;
and all those islands across from Cape York, along the
Barrier Reef, and right over to British New Guinea, i re
Commonwealth territory, and within the meaning of the
Act. All the pearl-shell that will be obtained from the

purely a white man’s, with splendid wages attached
th reto, and should be conserved for white men, and white

deal with Thursday Island for their supplies—supplies are
mostly imported from abroad, with Lhe exception of flour
and beef, and very often flour is imported from America.

community, at this rate.

The ladies who bound over the hurdles on
the bright shores of the Mediterranean are still
bounding at Sydney Royal, though it is under-
stood that their season is drawing near a close.
It is as well that the “Runaway Girl” should
depart while the sun is still ashine on Brother
Tamarind’s tonsure and while the mild idiot is
still fishing gently in the early morning, for it is
a slender though cheerful little item, and not the
kind that should remain until the public begin to
analyse it. The comet that travels fast is an
impressive object, but if it stopped some one
would put it into a bottle and prove that there
was practically nothing in it. The “Runaway
Girl,” being also a bright, gassy object, needs to
get away while its tail is unimpaired. The
frenzied gyrations of Lord Coodle, and the tem-
porary appearance of Lauri and Carrie Moore in
grand opera, and Florence Young’s dimple, and
the fishing lunatic, and a good deal of the music
can be cordially recommended, but the haste
and velocity and whiz of the people concerned
disguise a good many things that might
be a good deal less recommended if anybody
had time to notice them. Some of the songs in
the “ Runaway Girl ” will linger after the Girl
herself has fled—perhaps Miss JPalotta’s “Listen
to the Band ” will linger as long' as any of them.
Also the “ Man from Cook’s” and the hurdle race
will be remembered awhile, especially as many
girls have seriously barked their shins trying to
do likewise. Some of the largest ankles in Sydney
just now are solely owing to bandages caused by
the “Man from Cook’s.”

“Boy Jim,” at Sydney Criterion, con-
tinues to put modern touches into its version of
“Rodney Stone.” Microbes, co-operative stores,
&c., are alluded to by characters who should know
nothing about them, and modern photographs
adorn the early nineteenth century drawing-room
of actress Margaret Trevellion. The characters
remain very much as before, except that Mr. J. P.
West falls badly when enacting valet Ambrose.
It is surprising that so good an actor in certain
lines as J. P. should tumble so ineffectively.
Miss May Hesford, as champion Harrison’s wife,
acts too heavily. One wants to see her encounter
a stray tack on the Criterion flooring, so that site
may get excited for even a minute or so. Billy
M’Carthy’s ball-punching exhibition is generally
encored, and the encounter of that pugilist with
Alf. Woods, in Act 111., meets with universal an-
proval. Miss Williamson’s version of “The
Christian” is billed for next Saturday. Sydney
has already seen Kingston and Tyrone Power in
the part of that gloomy gospeller, and it awaits
the third man with carefully-concealed excite-
ment.
** * *
“In Sight of St. Paul’s ” does excellent
business at Sydney Lyceum, the reason thereof
being less obvious than it might be. The good
brother acts with his usual imbecility, and the
scenery with its customary precision. The fire
scene and the Cathedral scene keep well up to the
mark, and cab-horses come and go with the grace
and vigor usual in Bland Holt’s dramas.
** * *
The World’s Entertainers are drawing
their Sydney season to a close, and some gigantic
programmes are promised for the concluding per-
formances. There have been this week some minor
changes of programme—Bunth and Rudd giving
an exhibition of eccentric dancing, and “the
merry World ” being brightened with new songs.
Ada Willoughby’s “Domestic Incident ” is a
charming little bit of work and shares with
Salerno’s feats the palm of merit in a fine variety
show. But the World’s Entertainers’ manage-
ment should remember for future seasons that a
variety company, however excellent, can never be
relied on for a more than two or three weeks’ run.
Only by constant changes can a music hall be kept
filled.

Victor J. Daley’s Bohemian Night hap-
pened to a fairly full Sydney Town Hall on
Thursday. The programme had three intervals,
which seems the correct thing on Bohemian
Nights, and the items, as usual, got mixed. It
was a generally good programme. Harry Wilkie
and the Permans made entertaining light items.
Some other people mentioned on the list would
almost certainly have been brilliant if they had
turned up. The rendering of the hackneyed
“Where is Now the Happy Family?” was an
artistic triumph. A good many things got mixed
besides the programme. There was trouble about
the liquor department in the early part of the
evening, the license, or something to that effect,
not having been obtained in time. The muddle
about the tickets also bade fair to rival the
famous Beauchamp trouble re the blue card
and the pale one. First they were to be
Is.; then it was decided to make them
2s. Later on someone remembered the
drought and bad times, and brought them down
to Is. again. At that figure they fortunately re-
mained, though the recollection of another person
that the cause of Art and Literature was at
stake nearly sent them up to Is. 6d. or half-a-
crown. As usual, a large number of conventional
people thronged the front of the hall, while the
geniuses kept to the back, or wandered about
behmd the scenes. During the First Part a loud
C j. er ‘ u ‘ voice was heard from somewhere, and
the ordinary people pricked up their ears and said
it must be a genius broken loose. However, it was
discovered later on to be a human being, and was
put outside. This writer thinks it would pay well
at future Bohemian Nights if a collection of
typical geniuses were put in cages, with the
necessary refreshment, so that the awed grocer
and Philistine could inspect them. They could
be labelled as poets, artists, sculptors, musicians,
authors, People Who Have Great Thoughts, and
miscellaneous. The latter crowd would include
those who h.ave never done anything in particular,
but who are liable to break out at any moment,
and who, in the meantime, have long hair and a
grnat thirst, and a bulging brow like a tombstone,
and a remarkable threepenny collar, and a habit
of being suddenly petrified with inspiration at
street-corners, to go on with.

tt ec t. ure( l at Sydney Queen’s
Hall last Saturday, in accompaniment to some
extra wngglesome cinematographe pictures of the
Oberammergau Passion Play. Most of the New
lestament was presented to the small audience
during the evening. Adlam did not command his
cinematographe following as well as Snazelle
did. Whenever Adlam said that Peter or
someone would now arise and do such and
such a thing, there was always a fair ohance
that Peter either remained down or got
up and did something quite different. The
Betrayal took place just outside the Last
ouppm Room, sonie of the disciples sitting still
evidently to finish the feast, while the others
trooped outside through an unstable doorway.
Pontius Pilate, as an excited, nervous little man
running up and down the steps of his throne, was
a realistic character. Judas, as a Domain loafer
with disordered hair, stayed on the sheet some
time, and did whatever the lecturer told him. He
was the most orderly and best-regulated disciple
present, and a strong contrast to the unreliable
1 eter. Ihe entertainment was billed for
nigl T° re performances > the final one this Saturday

A wanm welcome was given to the net-
ball players on their return to Sydney Tivoli this
week. Ihe two teams are now supposed to repre-
sent, not England and Australia, but Victoria and
New South Wales, and the strength of our Federal
love is shown by the fact that there is a 10 times
more eager desire that N.S.W. should scruff Vic
and knock her wind out than there used to be that
Australia should carry out these kindly offices
towards England. Newcomers at this theatre are
a „ a T r(l1 ’ a Pleasant Australian serio-comic,
and Professor Fred. Harcourt, a magician, who
talks more than any magician we have yet met.
Harris and Walters take well with the public—
which fact doesn’t modify a previously expressed
opinion as to their merits, or want of them.

Amy Castles and Daui will give two fare-
well concerts at Sydney Town Hall to-night
(Saturday) and Monday afternoon. Miss Castles
is making back for Europe to have her voice
further improved, and Dani also departs shortly
presumably for his own boot-shaped country
Misses Maud Dalrymple, Una Bourne, and Nora
M Kay are likewise on the bill, and these three
ladies would make a very respectable concert by
themselves, even if the two stars went amissing.

Mr. Fred Clutsam’s Orpheus Society had
a field night at Melb. Town Hall—its first
appearance outside of the suburbs—on Tuesday,
the 13th. Once again the wisdom of the modern
Invitation Concert system was proved by the
result, something like 2000 seats being booked
It is an excellent system. The amateur chorus
and the mostly amateur orchestra number 200
performers, and a generous distribution of
invitations among their friends is followed by a
pretty general rush to book seats at one shilling
each (booking fee,) lest there be no free seats
available when the event comes off. It is all the
same thing as a “ shilling pop ” concert with a full
house guaranteed, but the Invitation gives it an
air of social and musical superiority, and the seat-
bookers, as a rule, enjoy their money’s-worth in
evening dress. For that matter there is a good
deal of ‘ class ”in the orchestra and chorus, so the
Orpheus may be expected to go ahead. All
things considered clever Fred Clutsam has done
very well with his amateurs thusfar. The
unaccompanied part singing is effective, and the
orchestra, can play Beethoven’s “Prometheus”
Overture and other things in pleasing style.
Choir and orchestra together gave two numbers
the other night ; a rather long, dull concerto,
buU cello and orchestra got pardoned for
±lattenbach s sake. Judging from the rustlo of
expectation when she made her first appearance,
and the encore at the end of her “Ah! fors’ e
lui, Albertine Gay must have been
boomed in Orpheus circles. But the new prima-
donna-a tall lady (Swiss) with reddish fair hair
and no deportment to speak of—was a disappoint-
ment to many people. She didn’t sing the Verdi
air, or the Valse-Song from “Romeo and Juliet”
like a bird, or an angel. A fairly strong and well
trained voice, not particularly sweet in any of the
notes. Perhaps she will be happier in less florid
music.
** * M
Coming after a colorless “As You Like
It, and an uneventful “Romeo and Juliet,” the
recent production of “ Twelfth Night ” at Her
Majesty s (Melb.) was a comparatively brilliant
achievement. Probably few people in the not
very numerous Saturday-night audience knew the
possibilities of the comedy they had come to see.
It had not been played for 14 years, nor did it get
a good all-round interpretation from the Essie
Jenyns Co. m ’BB. Hence the pleased astonish-
ment of the majority at discovering that
Shakespeare, under favorable conditions, can be
quite as funny as the author of “Jones.” They
came to suffer the entertainment for the sake of
its respectability, and they remained to revel in it.
ar .? s , P resenfc scribe’s experience goes, the
Twelfth Night ” that happened last Saturday is
the most enjoyable and easily digested bit of
classic drama on Melbourne record, and if local
Culture doesn’t demand more of it ere the season
terminates Culture is just about too tired to
live.
* • •
“ Twelfth Night ” has no famous “ star ”
parts, or test scenes, in which leading artists can
expect to score great reputations. Fashionable
mummers avoid plays that put several characters
on almost equal terms. Another reason why
“ Twelfth Night ” seldom pops up is the difficulty
in getting a Viola who will look so much like a
young man that she may be duplicated in a
reasonably convincing manner by a male member
of the co. When Essie .Tenyns played Viola
young Greenaway was only a passable imper-
sonator of the twin-brother who gets mistaken
for her—that is to say, the plot barely
escaped ridicule. The resemblance between Miss
Waldorf and Frank Green is sufficiently striking
in respect to the faces, figures and voices of the
alleged twins. Moreover, they act up to one
another’s identities, and it is conceivable that
Olivia (handsomely and amorously played by
Miss Mackay) can, by a stretch of red-hot imagi-
nation, mistake “ Sebastian ” Green for the boy
she had originally coveted in the form of his
sister, “ Viola ” Waldorf. The graceful feminine
manliness of Miss W. makes her a natural Viola,
and when she comes to fight her duel, the little lady
seems to live in the character. With one or two ex-
ceptions, the co. at Her Majesty’s might have been
carefully selected for their places in this passing
production. Atholwood, as Sir Toby Belch, is a
fine study of alcoholic knighthood, humorously
and Shakespearianly drunk and riotous. A rare
old brand of Atholwood, fortified with early 17th
century spirit—a red, roaring reality. Lawrence
Hanray presents an amusing Andrew Aguecheek
on a pair of phenomenally thin legs, Edmund
Gwenn is the clown again, and Norval M‘Gregor
suits himself cleverly to the part of Malvolio.
An unctuous comedian might be more
effective, but Norval is a good dry joke, any-
how. Miss May Chevalier, as Maria, helps
the success ; also, Melford is a strong, impressive
sea-captain, and the Dook of Illyria nurses his
hopeless passion for Olivia in a deserving way. If
all the characters enunciated their words more
clearly the admirers of Divine William would
have less trouble in appreciating that gentleman’s
immortal lines, but they could hardly expect any-
thing better in “legitimate” extravagant comedy
than the duel between Viola and Andrew, or the
scenes of Toby’s awful insobriety. The play is
neatly mounted and excellently stage-managed.
* * * *
For to-night (Thursday) and to-morrow
the advt. promises “Camiile,” and unless the
managerial arrangement changes its mind during
the week “A Royal Divorce’’ will transpire on
Saturday (24th), and the Napoleonic countenance
of H. H. Vincent will be seen in the foreground
of the Waterloo disaster. Meanwhile The Bul-
letin hopes for some more “Twelfth Night.”
When you have caught your Shakespeare in his
merriest mood he is a Bard to be encouraged, not
a person to be shoved aside after four nights by a
mawkish melodrama.
** # *
To-night (Thursday) is the last of “ What
Happened to Jones,” at Melb. Bijou. “Jones,”
preceded by the narrative of the parrot that made
awful revelations to the sailor’s wife, was staged
on Saturday, and the multitude rolled up, as of
yore, until the house was more than full. With
the exception of Frank Jenton, the original thin
young man of the company, all the people con-
cerned in “Jones” nowadays are new to their
characters. George Willoughby, formerly the
long-lost brother from Ballarat, takes Charles
Arnold’s place as the man who picks up Ebenezer
at a boxing-match, and puts the sound commercial
impudence of the bagman in a different light.
Tom Cannam is an active, distressful Ebenezer,
married to Miss Lillie Bryer. The policeman has
expanded into George Leopold ; the cap of the
stolid maid-servant sits lightly on Miss Merton’s
brow ; Miss Watts-Phillips is an appalling relic
of the past; whilst Roxy Barton, Ethel Appleton
and Minnie Ascoli appear as three nice girls, Miss
Barton being the. picturesque spinster who con-
ceals somebody’s trousers in the piano. Judging
from its trial revival on Saturday night, “Jones ”
is going to be of considerable value to the
Willoughby co. on tour.
*m * *
Thornton’s three weeks’ stay at the Prin-
cess’s ends to-morrow (Friday), and on Saturday,
it seems, George Musgrove will have, great plea-
sure in introducing a new comic-opera season with
a first local production of “ The Thirty Thieves.”
Fiye male principals of the new.co, are from Great
Britain and America, whereas the ladies are
Australian in some instances, and will be none
the less acceptable on that account. Besides, they
are all strangers to Melbourne, barring Miss May
Beatty, late of the “Runaway Girl ” co. Also,
the list of non-principal performers includes many
attractive names, and the fact that Slapoffski and
John Wallace are respectively conducting the
musical and dramatic arrangements is a guarantee
that “ The Thirty Thieves.” will get a fair start.
** * *
At the Royal they are about to withdraw
The Favorite, ■’ and set up “The Mariners of
England,” which profoundly patriotic drama
bears the respectable name of Robert Buchanan
on the title page. This is a point to be carefully
noted and remembered by recent patrons of the
Royal, who took exception to the lively foolishness
of Anderson’s shows and refused to find any consol-
ation in the scenery. The late Buchanan couldn’t
write a flagrantly unreasonable or inartistic
drama. “ The Mariners of England ” may exag-
gerate the British Lion in his private and public
capacities, _ but it will never permit the leading
villain to tie his aunt to a mill-wheel or anything
of that sort. 6

The Broughs, very doubtful of the effect
of their comparatively quiet comedy on a purely
mining-town audience, went on to Broken Hill
after farewelling Melb. The result was just
middling. The “Village Priest” brought the
most money; then“ Niobe.” “The Tyranny of
'.fearswas struck out of the programme, after
the crowd’s temperature had been taken, as being
too quiet. Largely-Cornish Broken Hill loves
best of all, though, something with a song in it.

Adelaide Royal has had “The Sorrows of
Satan” played by the “Sweet Nell” co. Lucy
Wilson replacing Nellie Stewart; one way or
another, this house has seen a good deal of the
Devil lately. Acting and mounting both splendid
the play itself is about what one might expect from
a tragic writer who calls a female character Delila
Dragnette. The Broughs, always very popular in
Adelaide, have started farewelling strongly with
“ Lady Huntworth’s Experiment,” for winch the
alternative title of the “Cook-Ladies’ Union” is
hereby respectfully suggested. Darkness has
descended on the Tivoli, which has been a bright
spot for practically two years without a break.
Ihe Graggs have gone to London, and the rest of
the co. to Perth (to return later on with Sandow)
while “The Wrong Mr. Wright” does not
materialise for a week or two yet.

The assurance funds now total £17,864,514, and the
reserve for possible depreciation of securities stands at
£247,735.
The expense rate, which is always very low in
the A.M.P. office, has diminished considerably this year
and is even lower than usual. The record since 1892 is as
follows:
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1893 .. £8 15 4 per cent. 1898 .. £9 4 0 per cent
1894 .. 8 7 0 „ 1899 .. 919 8 ..
1895 .. 8 8 8 „ 1900 .. 9 0 6
1896 .. 818 1 „ 1901 .. 810 0
1897 .. 8 12 3 ”
These figures differ somewhat from those published in
this column last year, inasmuch as amounts spent on
improvements to premises were formerly reckoned as
expenses, whereas it has been deemed a fairer statement
of the case to include them among sums written off.
Assuming that they were wholly improvements and in no
sense repairs, then they might have been added, under
less scrupulous management, to the book value of the
properties, and that not having been done the amounts
may fairly be regarded as a writing-off.
The rate of interest realised on the average
funds has again dropped, though the fall this year is
microscopic. A good deal of the recent decline, too,
arises from the fact that the assets now include a much
larger proportion of State securities than they did a few
years ago. The record is as follows :
Interest Realised on Average Funds.
1893 £5 13 6 per cent.
1894 511 10 ~
1895 5 5 2 „
1896 5 0 5 „

1898 £4 14 10 per cent.
1899 411 10 „ -
1990 497
1901 4 9 6 „
As a partial set-off against this there is a great
improvement in the method of investment, and the
assets held to-day are a much better lot than those of
nine years ago. They may be summarised as follows :
. . 1893. 1902. Increase.
State securities .. £381,230 £3,008,187 £2,626,957
Mortgages .. .. 7,230,750 8,533,924 1,303,174
Loans on policies .. 3,110,498 3,992,420 881,922

Cash, &c 906,379 860,258
£12,280,862 £18,297,032
Mortgages and property form a mucn smaller percentage
of the assets than they did nine years ago. In case of
depreciation there is still £247,735 at the credit of depre-
ciation fund, out of the sums set aside at different times.
And it would be much better if there was £500,000 at the
credit of this fund ; better still if there was £1,000,000.
lor in spite of the great fall in property values,
these values, especially in Sydney, are still under a dark
suspicion of being inflated by the ridiculous loan boom
and wholly untrustworthy. At the latest computation,
about two years ago, the paper valuation of Sydney in
proportion to its population, was the highest in the
British empire—almost exactly twice as high per inhabit-
ant as that of Glasgow, Manchester, or Liverpool, and
over three times as high as Belfast, Hull, or Nottingham 1
There seems to be room for a big fall on these figures.
Making all deductions, however, the A. M. P.’s
balance-sheet is a splendidly prosperous document. One
curious feature about the institution is that it is gradu-
ally ceasing to become a Sydney institution, and is
steadily gravitating Melbournewards. Within the last
nine years the number of policies held in N.S.W. has in-
creased by 12,555 ; those held in Victoria by 16,978, In
the same period the amount of insurance in force in
N.S.W. has increased by £1,983,001; in Victoria, by
£3,244,891. There are now more policies held in Victoria
than in New South Wales, and in a very few years, at the
present rate, there will be a larger amount of assurance
held there also.
The report states that, in view of the difficulty
in finding profitable outlets for money, it is proposed to
apply to Parliament for power to extend the Society’s
range of investment. In what direction it is proposed to
extend it is not stated, but if it is intended to acquire
power to invest in city properties the idea is an excellent
one—with strict limitations. Property is a violently
fluctuating asset, but if an assurance society invested in
it largely and judiciously, kept its property accounts
separate, took into account only sufficient of the rents to
yield at most 4* per cent, on the amount invested,
and appli d the rest to writing down the
book value of the properties, it should, in a few
years, be safe from all risk of sudden deprecia-
tion. In fact, a time might come when it would
own one or two millions worth of property, the value of
which had been wholly written off. In that case the
property would constitute a splendid reserve fund ; the
rents received from it would be clear profit, and this
would have been accomplished without any loss to the
policy-holders while the writing-down process was in
progress. On some such basis as this careful investment
in city property should be worth considering.
Apropos of that frequent bush yarn about the
ancient inhabitant who dies at the age of 103, it is notice-
able that the A.M.P. Society, in its records for the last nine
years, out of about 200,000 carefully selected policy-
holders who have been on its books during that
period, seems only to have once possessed a policy-
holder as old as 96 years. He is alive now, and is a soli-
tary specimen. It has also one aged 95, one of 94, and
one of 92.

containing pyrites, carbonate of copper and tin. Like all
tables, the best work is done on “ fines,” and more espe-
cially when the product is properly classified. The

sole agents in the Eastern States. The table has a capa-
city up to 30 tons per day.*

The large sewerage pumping engines for the
Metropolitan Board of works, the contract for which was
secured by the Austral Otis Engineering Company of
South Melbourne, have just been complete;!, and' are
being erected at the Spottiswood Station. These engines
are vertical, triple expansion, and condensing, with
equilibrium trip valves, designed on what is known as
the Sultzer type, the engines are fitted with a massive
three, throw -crank and fly-wheels giving a positive
stroke to the sewerage pumps, which are directly con-
nected with the steam pistons and placed some 50:feet
below the surface. The air and auxiliary pumps are
worked by levers from the main engines. These engines
are the largest that have yet been constructed in Australia,
the total weight being nearly 220 tons, were designed
in the office of the contracting company, and the work-
manship and finish reflect the highest credit on them as
builders. Much opposition was shown to entrusting this
work to the Australian firm, who are to be congratuied
for showing that Australian engineers can both design
and build such high class engines.*

on the shareholders’ funds as at the beginning of the
half-year, or C:H 16s. 7d. per cent, on capital—the sort or
percentage that is not met with every day. The business
shows a material increase all round during the half-year.
One most conspicuous feature is that debts due to the
public (deposits, notes, &c.)are £2,013,687, while the re-
serve of cash, bullion and State securities is £1,166,436,
equal to no less than 57 per cent.—probably the strongest
reserve in Australia. Of this large amount only £64,000
is in State securities. Perhaps the VVestralian Bank in-
vests only in the securities of its own State. And per-
haps it has seriously considered the securities of its own
State, and decided that it is best to leave them alone.

The Conference of State Premiers has suggested
that the Federal Government ought to pay for State
properties taken over by taking over a corresponding
amount of 31 per cent. State debt. Solomon could not
have come to a wiser decision than the State Premiers
have done in this matter. Among other advantages, the
arrangement opens up a way by which all dispute re
valuations may be avoided. If any State objects to the
Federal valuation of the property to be handed over,
the Commonwealth can get out of the trouble by
offering all the States as much over and above the value
of the property as will represent £1 or 12 or £3 per in-
habitant. So long as the overcharge is arranged, so that
all the States will swindle the Commonwealth in
the same proportion, it doesn’t matter much if the
Commonwealth pays three, times the valfie of
the property—so long as it pays by taking over State
debts. It only means that the people will pay the inte-
rest in Federal taxation instead of State taxation. The
larger the swindle the better a beginning is made of the
important work of taking over the State debts, and as
the Commonwealth is much more likely to take measures
for the repayment of these debts than the States are, the
more debt it takes over the better. The case is one in
which the Commonwealth can afford to buy the State
properties at the States’ own price, or even more—in fact,
ft is a chance of being liberal such as a Commonwealth
only meets with once in a century or so.
One most essential point is that, wherever pos-
sible, and as far as possible, the Commonwealth should
pay by taking over State debts contracted since Ist
January, 1901 —the date the Federal Constitution came
into force. All debts existing before that date can be
assumed by the Commonwealth merely as part of a gene-
ral scheme of consolidation, but the clause dealing with
consolidation gives no power to take over any later lia-
bilities. It seems to be beyond a doubt, however, that
debts incurred since then can be assum 'd by the Common-
wealth in payment for proper ies surrendered. And, as
it is most desirable that all the State debts should be con-
solidated under Federal management, the Commonwealth
should take over the old debts—or as much of them as
possible—under its general powers, and seize this oppor-
tunity to assume the new ones.

The Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Co.
(Sydney) concluded another splendidly-prosperous year
on 31st March, 1902. In the table given below, capital
and reserves are added together for the reason that the
Australian Mutual Fire Co. is perpetually transferring
portions of its reserve to capital, hence the two become
inextricably mixed. The paid-up capital (originally
£6250) has increased in the last dozen years from £12,500
to £50,000, solely out of profits, and, at the same time,
the reserves have grown from a little over £75,000 to
about £lll.OOO. The rates of dividend shown below are,
however, the rates paid on the capital actually put into
the co. (£6250) oy the shareholders—the rates which origi-
nal shareholders receive. They are a lucky crowd, those
original shareholders: —

According to the balance-sheets the rate per cent, of the
dividend keeps diminishing. This is through the constant
capitalisation of profits, but the real return, based on the
amount which the shareholders actually invested in the
business, has kept rising till it reaches a gorgeous figure.
The Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Co. has
now £56,000 paid-up capital, and £111,533 of reserves.
The income from investments alone is £6237—almost
enough to pay 100 per cent, dividend on the original paid-
up capital of £6250, and more than enough to pay 12 per
cent, on the present nominal capital of £50,000. The
co.’s good fortune depends mostly on an intensely careful
selection of risks. For the year just closed its net
premium income was £34,961, and its losses only £9356,
and this is quite a common and ordinary state of things
with it. At the same time, while it is a splendid spec,
for the proprietors, this kind of co. doesn’t amount to
much in a fire insurance sense. If all companies worked
on the same principles probably three-fourths of all exist-
ing property would be refused as a risk by every office,
and the only place that any co. would insure would be
the one where fire was almost impossible.

There have just been received at this office two
copies of the Forester, a monthly publication issued by
the 1.0. F., that bumptious, cheap-jack Canadian assur-
ance concern which, through the lack of a decent life
assurance law, has lately been able to take up its quarters
in Australia. There is an immense amount of literary
bunkum in these two numbers. But while the 1.0. F.,
whose chief boast is its cheapness, has time to write on
almost every subject under the sun, it never seems able
to spare a second to explain why its policy, going by the
most recent balance-sheet that the writer has at hand,
as compared with that of the A.M.P., has the misfortune
to pan out like this :

Premium £1 13 7
Less all expenses and sums written off assets.. 0 6 0
Leaving to accumulate for payment of policy.. £1 8 7
What The Bulletin desires to say once more
is just this :
(1) As regards the small policy-holder, who is also by
far the most numerous class of policy-holder, the 1.0.F.’s
alleged cheapness is a fraud and a sham. It costs more
to insure for £lOO in the 1.0. F. than in the best Aus-
tralian offices. The 1.0.F.’s premiums are less, but the
additional charge of court dues makes the total more.
(2) The 1.0. F. spends more in expenses, partly dis-
guised as court dues than the A.M.P.,so that while it
charges more there is less left to accumulate to pay the
policy at maturity. Therefore the policy has less chance
of being paid.
(3) While its policy costs more, there is no surrender
value attached to it.
■ (4) The only chance of the 1.0. F. being able to pay all
its claims lies in a large number of its policy hoiders
dropping out and losing everything they have paid. The
A.M.P. and every other decent Australian office can pay
in full even if every policy-holder hangs on till his policy
becomes a claim. The 1.0. P., if all its policy-holders re-
mained with it, doesn’t seem at all likely to be able to pay
ss. in the £.
Among all the 1.0.F.’s literary slush concerning its
alleged cheapness there is a dead silence about how it
comes to pass that it charges the small policy-holder so
much more than any decent Australian office would
dream of doing. It dodges this urgent point by stating
haughtily that the attacks made upon it arise from envy
of its great success—or its great deficit, or something. It
is particularly strong on the fact that the hostility of
what it calls “ the great Australian companies” arises
from this source. The 1.0.F.’s publication doesn’t even
seem to know that the great Australian institutions are
not “companies,” but mutual societies. Also it makes
great capital out of the names of “Brother” Edmund
Barton and “Brother” John Forrest and “Brother”
George Leake, and other brothers. If these men have
lent their names to the concern it is so much the worse
for their names.

The N.S.W. Treasurer denied with some energy
last week that his Government was thinking of another
£4,000,000 loan. No doubt he spoke quite truly, but he
will almost certainly be thinking about it, or something
very like it, in another week or two. Westralia is also
said to be thinking of the same subject. It is several
weeks now since an Australian loan of any size was

The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Co.
(Wellington, Maoriland) shows a respectable profit for the
year ended 28th February, 1902. The land revenue item
is the amount received from the splendid Government
grant with which the co. was endowed when it commenced
business, and the interest on reserves accumulated out
of that revenue :
~ , Railway Land tv,,;,) Total
Feb - Profits! Profits. Dividends. Reserves.
1898.. £63,124

1902 .. 7,969 3,624 6 „ 10,200 78,256
When the Wellington and Manawatu Railway is quoted,
as it often is, as an example of the excellent results
achieved by private railway management as against the
State variety, there are various things to be considered in
addition to the above. The land earnings (which include
for the year just finished £llO3 interest from investments,
these being the accumulation of past earnings from the
co.’s land endowments) are a very large item in the
revenue, and if the State epdowed its" own railways
with equally liberal land-grants they would probably
show up as well. Then the railway profits themselves are
not wholly derived from private enterprise. In ad lition
to the magnificent land-grant, the Government built a
portion of the line itself and made the 00. a present of it.
The co. values this present at £sl,B3B—roughly, one-
fourteenth of the whole value of the line and rolling-
stock. This reduces the earnings from that proportion of
the railway which represents purely private enterprise to
£74,000, equal to £4 7s. per cent, on capital. And if the
State charged as heavy rates on its lines as the Wellington
and Manawatu co. does, the probabilities are that it
would earn £4 7s. per cent. also. Private Enterprise
which lives so very extensively on State aid is not Private
Enterprise.

The cable mentions that a co. has been
floated in London for the purchase of “Buckley and
Nunn,” the Melb. drapery business—capital £390,000,
including £130,000 of 5 per cent, debentures, which is
practically all the cash vendors are asking for. Years
ago, just at the end of Melbourne boom-time, Mars Buck-
ley (whose partner, Nunn, had previously died) sold his
business to the Robt. Reid syndicate for £250,000 or more,
and, 12 months later, when the local slump was not to be
denied, the purchasers offered to transfer their bargain
back to Buckley for £lOO,OOO less than his sale price, it
was said. But the lucky ex-draper had wiped the dust of
the shop from his boots, and this “alarming sacrifice"
didn’t tempt him. Since then, the old and classic busi-
ness has seemed to move with the times, and its appear-
ance on fine afternoons is most healthy.

The Ashton magazine rifle is cropping up again
in newspaper pars. Ashton years ago got a Melb. syndi-
cate to put some money into his patented firearm, and!
with the invention and the money he went to England,
Germany, and other likely places of business, trying to
sell the patent rights. A dozen reports of success have
bfeen published, but the rifle didn’t seem to go off in real
earnest. Now it is said that a London syndicate has come
to terms with Ashton, and will take over the patent, pay-
ing £2500 cash and one-fourth of the issue of shares in a.
prospective company, provided that the inventor will
rectify two defects in the rifle. Seems rather late in the-
day to talk about defects.

Cobarite : “ Drought is not the worst affliction;
here. A newlv-appointed inspector of mines is doing
more to paralyse the field. Systems of mining which
have been approved by previous inspectors—some of
whom have been practical miners—are condemned by this;
gentleman, and mineowners are called upon to do most
expensive and quite unnecessary work. Occidental 00.
told that it must timber its open-cut. Timber is a costly
item here, and it would deplete the biggest forest within
100 miles to brace the Occidental excavation. If done it
could serve no useful purpose regarding it as a protection
to life. On the contrary, it would create greater dangers;
than exist. A sense of false security would lead to-
neglect of the every-day precautions now observed. As-
things are, everything is exposed to the garish light of
day, the risks stare managers and workmen in the face ;
if a rock-slip occurs they have a chance to get out of the
way. But with a timber covering there will be no such;
safeguard—a falling rock might dislodge the key-piece
and, without warning, the men working underneath
would be buried in a network of timber. Great Cobar
trihutors have been notified that they must fill in their
bigstopes. Economy would prompt the owners to do
this were suitable filling material available at reasonable
cost. Local conditions favor the pillar-system, but the-
inspector will have none of it. Iron-slag, which is to be
dumped into the mine—positively the worst filling that
could be used, as it does not bind—will have to be hauled
out again in years to come to flux the siliceous ore from,
adjoining mines, and then—look out for human sacrifice I
The worst feature about the Mines Inspection Act is that
it makes the officials supreme in their arrogance, and
sometimes, ignorance. Their word is law, no appeal
against it. Writer is confident that if 10 unprejudiced
practical men were asked to report on this Cobar business-
they would unanimously endorse his opinion." Is there 1
another side to this matter ?

Sydney dailies used up all their stock of super-
latives to enthuse over the cabled news of the formation;
of a co. to run Sandford’s Lithgow iron-works. At last,
said they, N.S'.W. iron deposits, “perhaps the richest in
the world,” are to be turned to account. The gush was-
seriously discounted when Sandford’s Sydney manager
had his say. It is not certain that the co.’will use N.S.VV.
ore. The manager talks about the large deposit of ore at’
Oarcoar, but adds—“ It will be a question of experimenting
at first to see if it will be suitable. We might possibly want
Tasmanian ore.” It was in the interests of Sandford
Lithgow and Carcoar that the State Govt., backed up by
the Sydney dailies, blocked the project to establish exten-
sive works on the Parramatta River to smelt Tasmanian;
ores. It is also clear that the Lithgow Co. does not intend!
the manufacture of steel rails, which was to have been the;
leading feature of the proposed Ryde works.

“ J.A.” (Canbelego, N.S.W.) takes exception, to
a par. (3/5,”02) in which it was stated that, outside the
established mines at Mount Boppy, the prospecting shows;
were worth nothing. He has been prospecting in the
locality for six years and has had assays from 12dwt to-
22dwt. from a depth of 150 ft. He does not state what-
have been the results of crushings from 150 ft. of sinkiri"
The battery-box, and not the assay-pot, is the test of
value.

stampers for five shillings; for two days’ work he got

cate, while the probably inexperienced person, who, on
the passing of the Act, was in charge of a fossicking
claim employing 20 men, gets the paper.

Cobar Chesney : Half-yearly report shows that
during term of Mr. O’Gorman’s option, 6000 tons ore
assaying about 4 per cent, copper, with gold varying up
to Sdwts. per ton, were treated. Bottom level north
proved to be richest section of mine ; 458 tons broken in
driving level 114 ft., averaging 4| per cent. Manager
Woolcock reports that for a length of 800 ft., lode averages
over 30ft. wide. In a trial run of 99 hours, concentrating-
plant treated 460 tons ore assaying 3'62 per cent, copper,
the product being 78 tons concentrates, assaying over 13
per cent, copper, and up to 7£dwts. gold. This means a
recovery of only 621 per cent, of assay value, yet directors
and manager consider it “satisfactory.” Mr. Woolcock
is of opinion that—“ Given proper smelting equipment,
with economical and judicious supervision (time-honored
stock-phrase) the mine will eventually prove to be a
remunerative one even at the present price of copper.”
Directors are seeking the advice of skilled metallurgists
on the best method and cost of converting concentrates
into copper. More fat fees to experts for indefinite
“ ifs and ands.” It would be intere-iting to know how
many thousands of pounds have been paid to experts for
reports on the property. A common-sense report would
be—“find an iron-mine and concentrate by fire.”
Balance-sheet shows that at 31st March bank balance was
£489 and sundry creditors £1360; debentures issued,
£19,150 ; uncalled capital, £11,250. Further calls will be
necessary to carry on ordinary work. Oo.’s position hope-
less unless shareholders are prepared to take up portion
of the unissued shares and, considering that only a few
ventured to take debentures, there is not much chance
of that. It seems inevitable that property will fall into
hands of debenture-holders, and what a “ soft snap” they
will have in getting such a mine for £20,000 1

Further evidence that Mt. Lyell can assimilate
the N. Lyell property to advantage is shown by manager
Sticht’s announcement that the big mine’s smelters can
do double the work required of them at present. Five
smelters (No. 2 plant) are enough for the eo.’s own out-
put; six smelters (No. 1 plant) are practically idle. The
assumed capacity of each of the No. 2 smelters was 120
tons, but 370 tons have been through one of them in 24
hours, and the management claims that experience has
taught them that the greater the blast the better the
results. The inability of the present mining plant to
supply sufficient ore for all the smelters is a serious
matter for Queenstown, owing to the reduction of hands
threatened.

Generally stated among mining folks that Mr.
North Mt. Lyell Trent and his reverberatory smelters
were condemned without trial because of the .yelping of
certain N. Mt. Lyell pups. Said pups, mostly flux-shows
and held by “ the Melbourne crowd,” would have been left
out in the cold had the reverberator been proved a success.
But there are wheels within wheels, and the man who
thinks he knows the peculiar ways of the gentle mining
expert is a vain person indeed. That ex-manager Trent
should have gone off quietly without showing open fight
(and allegedly under bond of secrecy) is a matter that
seems to call for explanation. Next shareholders’meeting
should prove interesting.

Hobart Mercury ponderously and persistently
barracks for an amendment of the Mining Act in the
direction of giving greater “security of tenure” than at
present obtains. The paper complains that flotation in
London is often made difficult owing to the possible
jumping of the show during the floater’s absence. It is
claimed that Private Enterprise is thus interfered with,
and development of mineral deposits unduly retarded.
It wants a speculator to have unlimited time and oppor-
tunity to hawk the show about looking for London capi-
tal, and urges that payment of rent should give absolute
security of tenure —the labor conditions should go hang.
What syndicate is pulling the strings this time ? Of all
the States, Tasmania has suffered most by the suspension
of labor conditions in mining.

On the strength of a report from Mr. Weinberg
(who retires at the end of June) Chillagoe shares have
improved in value. “As an industrial enterprise,” Mr.
W. considers, “ the Chillagoe should be a success, as the
properties are centrally situated in an extensive mineral
belt, which has not yet been thoroughly prospected, but
which presents every inducement to those desirous of
breaking new ground.” Surely, without reading between
the lines, that means condemnation, which is more than
confirmed by the details —the best prospect referred to
being 4 percent, ore in the Ruddvgore winze. Smelting
not likely to be resumed for three months, when another
manager will have to run the mines with the promised
“ advantage to shareholders.” What has become of the
might}' Stewart? Has he gone to the Continent to share

Richard, of Mount Morgan G.M., has been gas-
conading. “ Generally, I think we in Australia are ahead
of the Americans in gold-mining. We have taught them
about dredging, and we are in advance of them in the
treatment of refractory ores, and, if ever they get deep
mines like Ballarat, they will have to go there to learn
the business.” It will be news to Australians that deep-
mining is carried on at Ballarat. Surely Mr. Richard
must know that the Comstock mines were worked to
nearly 4000 ft., and that some of the Lake Superior copper
mines are drawing ore from nearly 5000 ft.
The Vic. Miners’ Association brought several
things under the Minister’s official nose, t’other day,
among them its idea that in the interests of the industry
co’s should be compelled to put a percentage of profits to
reserve for use in exploring new ground. The Minister
answered that it would be a tough morsel to deal with in
Parliament on account of the feeling that it would be “ a
dictation to investors.” But the investor will not mind ;
the trouble will come from the speculator—the man who
cares little or nothing about divs., but makes his money
by putting the market up and clown, and who, therefore,
gains by having bloated divs. to-dav and a reaction to-
morrow. It isn’t Sailed dictation when a private land-
lord requires that his farm shall be fallowed one season in
three or four; and it fe not called dictation when the
Crown requires a paistoral tenant to keep down
rabbits and cultivate native edible plants. Yet the
same principle applies, only more so, in the mining ease
because an undeveloped mine gives, not a poor crop as
unfallowed land _ does, but no crop at all. For a start,
anyhow, there is no reason why a reserve-percentage
clause should not be put in new leases. As for the work-
ing miners the curse of their calling is the irregularity of
their employment. When a slump comes and they crowd
around for a job, wages are cut cruelly fine, and mostly,
after a few months of that, they haven’t the pluck to stick
out for better pay when the tide has turned and the divs.
are coming in. A percentage compulsorily put to reserve,
and invested in, say, the State's stock," would even-up
things a bit. v .

A Bulletin correspondent :r-“ * At Coal Creek
1 (Korumburra, Vic.) coal mine a new seam of coal is just
being opened out. The seam averages about 4ft. 6in.
thick, and is of splendid quality.’ That, or something
like it, has been the stock notification of the Vic. coal
' mines for the last 10 years, and has largely helped to keep
orumburra going. At present things are admittedly
dull, caused by the recent trouble between the Railway
Department and the Coal Creek Co. But the old tale
about a ‘ new seam ’ is on hand, and ‘ things are going
to boom directly.’ The coal from the ‘ new seam ’ is sus-
piciously like the original seam worked by the co.—long,
slatey, dull-looking stuff. It appears to have been formed
of forest growth similar to present day Gippsland timber,
and to have been disturbed a few thousand years before
its time. The Gippsland coal industry is worked on very
temporary lines. The surface buildings, machinery, etc.,
are all cheap and flimsy. And the miners largely live in
the same miserable huts (locally called 1 humpies’) that
they did in the infancy of the mines.”

N. S. W. Govt, is capable of being dog-mean in
its relations to municipal councils. For the Parramatta
Hospital for Insane, the local council is allowed 10s. 6d.
per patient per annum (for all municipal services and
supply of water). The subsidy last year reached £585.
The institution in three months used 7,420,000 gallons of
water. The Council purchased this water from the
Water and Sewerage Board (practically the Government)
at Is. per 1000 gallons, so the water cost it £371 per
quarter or £1484 per annum. Parramatta Council is, in
short, buying water at Is. per 1000 gallons from one Govt,
institution and being forced to sell it to another at about
sd. per 1000.
The sort of humanitarians the foreign-Jew gang

Among the mines of Great Britain the rate is 1.41 ; in
N.S.YV., 1.14. These are English Home Dept, figures for
1900.

Though concentration by oil has, so far as the
writer knows, never given satisfactory results when tested
in Australia—the Broken Hill co.’s investigated it—the
President of the British Mining Association spoke very
hopefully of it in his recent official review of modern
metallurgical'processes.

In Maoriland, an Auckland directorate, con-
sisting of business men who had never seen a mine,
controlled the destinies of a g.-m. syndicate. After the
mine had been-worked for some time it was found that
the claim was not large enough to deposit the mullock
(the surface area being only about 40 acres). The
question arose, “What shall we do with it?” One
director, a linen merchant, suggested, “ Why not dig a
hole and bury it?”
With reference to a statement which lately
appeared in a number of Australian papers (in-
cluding, we regret to say. The Bulletin), to the
effect that Mr. Charles Tilbury, the well-known
operatic singer, had died under somewhat painful
circumstances during the voyage to England, we
are glad to hear, on the authority of an officer of
the mail-steamer in which Mr. Tilbury travelled,
that the basso is not only alive, but reached Eng-
land in much-improved health.

SOCIETY
Lord Hopetoun seems to have thought
that the mental condition of Australians was
akin to that of Hindus, and that respect could
only be won for the office he held by a display of
gorgeousness on his part. Hence his great teams
of horses, his State coaches, his out-riders and
postilions, his armies of flunkeys in padded calves
and plush pants. But let us hope that Australia’s
ultimate pattern will be that Andrew Jackson,
who was his own postilion and his own out-rider
and who, when installed President of the United
States, rode up to the White House on his old
white horse, hitched it to a fence, was inaugurated,
a untied his moke and rode away.
Society ” folk in Australia may expect from the
Governor-General a show of barbaric state; the
mass of the people don’t call for it and would be
more than content with a Governor whose dignity
was buttressed by the lofty personality of a Higin-
botham or a Grey. One of the most respected
and beloved rulera of the day, and one of the
greatest is Diaz, of Mexico, who doesn’t even
occupy the Presidential palace, and runs a State
of 13,000,000 people in his private house.
Prime Minister Barton, leaving Australia', had
a face as long as a horse. He was sorrowfully
conscious that he had played a paltry part in the
Governor - General incident. Lord Hopetoun
mistaking the huzzas of street loafers and the
kow-tows of distinguished citizens for the voice
and the feeling of the Australian people, was
quite certain that Parliament would rush to vote
him an increase of salary. Mr. Barton knew
T^£ r ’ hadn’t the courage to say so, and
Ruffled on to Parliament the duty of saying
-No. It was not a fair thing to the Governor-
General, who can’t be blamed for so foolishly
JUDICIAL SYMPATHY.

Wearily wagging his reverend head he told a

The Old Age Pension business as it is
done in Victoria :
. Dear Bullbtin.—The applications for old age pensions
in this State are now heard in public, ostensibly with the
object of shaming the applicant’s relatives (if he has any)
into a sense of their moral obligation. Sometimes they
shame and sometimes they don’t, and the latter times are
more frequent than the other times, at least that is my
impression after attending a Court here the other day.
An old chap who applied has three brothers in the dis-
trict, each of whom is possessed of at least five figures’
worth of real estate, and yet, in reply to the P.M.’s usual
querv, he had to announce that he was earning 7s.
a week “ rabbiting,” and had to keep his wife on that.
The P.M. refused the application, and told the ancient
that his brothers ought to be ashamed of themselves.
True, no doubt, and well-deserved, but it doesn’t give
much satisfaction to the man who is still “ rabbiting ” to
keep his wife on 7s. a week. The compulsory clauses of
the Act do not include brothers, however wealthy.
Another applicant had a married son, who was “ not
doing too well ” and could not help his father. “ Any
children,” queried the P.M. “ Not yet,” said the old
man hopefully ; “ but they’re both young.” His case was
recommended. The best “piece” of the day was pro-
vided by an old negro, who had been in Australia
since ’57. “Where were you born?” asked the
P.M. “In Jamaica,” said the darkey. “Ah! let
me see! ” (running the magisterial forefinger down the
clauses of the Act). “ Asiatics are not entitled
to a pension, but I’ll make inquiries. Your application
will be postponed for a month.” The colored fellow-
subject walked out of the box without a word. He was
completely flabbergasted. The clerk leaned over the
bench and volunteered the information that Jamaica was \
in the West Indies. The P.M. was equal to the occasion.
He recalled the darky from the door and asked him was
he naturalised. “ I was not aware,” said the ancient
mass of ebony with dignity, “ that it was necessary for a
man to be naturalised who was born under the British
flag.” “ Hum I’’ said the Bench; “well, there are cer-
tain complications connected with your application which
make it impossible to decide it to-day. Adjourned for a
month.” And this was a P.M. not a J.P.—Albar.

The Victorian old age pensions law, which
gives the courts power to order children to con-
tribute to their parents’ support, is bringing out
some queer instances of luck. One son was shown
to be earning Bs. a day on the railways; also, he
had three blocks of land, all bought at boom
prices. But the land proved quite unsaleable and
unrentable, also his wife bore twins, and then
trq.'ets, and was now expecting another interest-
ing event, which, with her enlarged experience,
might result in something even more comprehen-
sive. He was excused, pending developments.

A correspondent:
Couldn’t something be done, by public discussion or
otherwise, to devise an alternative to the cruel custom
which obtains in very many hospitals of rousing up
patients of all kinds and degrees of suffering and sleeping
ability, at 4 or 5 a.m., for bed-making and other pur-
poses ? Who can say how many chances of life have not
been extinguished by the denial of an hour’s sleep to
patients who have been tossing, perhaps in agony, all
night, and have just fallen into slumber as the ear-crack-
ing gong sounds ? Surely arrangements could be made
to obviate such cruelty, and at the same time enable
cleansing requirements to be carried out just as
efficiently.

A. N.S.W. poor-asylum incident : A
Chinaman, after a long illness, apparently gives
up the ghost—a victim to “senile deKiy”; and
his body is swabbed and carried off to the dead-
house, awaiting burial next day. Time, 2 a.m. :
Another corpse is being deposited in the morgue
when the panic-stricken bearers see the defunct
Chow sitting up and glaring at them. The celes-
tial declares indignantly : “ What fph here ?
Where me baccy ? ” He was pacified with a whole
stick of ’baccy, and dicer in regular fashion two
days afterwards. Asylum authorities now care-
fully prod all alleged Chinese corpses.

When Maoriland’sCommander-in-chief was
reviewing the 10th contingent on parade, he
noticed that a sergeant in the position of marker
—for the squad to dress by—was all adrift in his
drill. Turning to the lieutenant in charge, he
roared, “ Here, sir ! Why is that marker not in
his place?” “.Because he’s a fool,’’coolly
replied the lieutenant. Collapse of the gold-

“M.S.” writes
concerning a
“kitchen tea ” :
Was asked to “ A
Kitchen Tea ” lately.
Went with the notion
that owing to the
drought and high prices,
tea and scandal were to
be served in fat stone
cups in the
quarters. Was put into
the ordinary stuffy draw-
ing-room where the fur-
niture was sitting upon
itself and the pictures
jostled each other on the
walls. Presently a
woman arrived and ex-
humed out of brown
paper a patent steam
ironer, one of those
heavy missiles used
against burglars, with a
sort of spout to heave it
by. “Set it here,” said
the hostess, clearing a
space between some pho-
tographs and bead mats ;
“it’s very heavy”— ad-
miringly. Another iron
was soon put alongside.
“They make a sweet
pair,” and she seemed
pleased. Monotony set
in when'six other guests
brought steam irons, and
the smile became a little
frozen. But her face
cleared up when rolling-
pins arrived alternating
with spice-boxes, nutmeg
graters and gravy-
basters. What with the
guests and kitchen
weapons there was no
room for tea to be served.
“Is she stocking a
shop?” I whispered.
“ Oh, no ! her nephew’s
to be married next week
and she promised to give
them their kitchenware.”
Then I knew what a
Kitchen Tea was.

“J.ELM.” on a
municipal matter: —
Sydney Oily Council’s
proficiency in the art of
“ how not to do it” is
shown in the running of
the elevators at that
glaring white elephant,
Queen Victoria markets.
The two lifts at the
Market-st. end are
usually in charge of
youths of very tender age
indeed, who are imbued
with a spirit of “ healthy
rivalry ” in the matter of
“ dodging ” those who desire to use them. I recently saw
one of the youths hang a card—“ Take the other lift ’’—on
the door of his particular lift-well, so that the other got all
the “ calls.” When the trick was detected there were wigs
on the green. The youths have great fun giving “ rides ”
to all the girls of their acquaintance— great fun. In
fact, these juvenile officials have so many distractions
that a passage in their lifts is a matter of great hazard.
The really dangerous system of placing giddy, thought-
less youngsters in charge of the elevators will come to an
abrupt close one of these days—when it has been the
means of an alderman hurting his finger, or a common
citizen being “elevated ” to the world beyond.

For 10 vacancies in the Victorian foot
police 149 ex-cohentingenters lined up, .t’other
day. A cursory medico knocked out 38 ; two
were over age and one under; 26 were under-
sized, and 31 failed at an exceedingly simple
examination in dictation and arithmetic ; while 29
faded away at various stages, mostly owing to
faint-heartedness or having to see a man about a
dog. Only 22 reached the standard of the common
or mediocre “copper.” The other 127 are under-
stood to be now pursuing the billets that Jingo
employers swore they would keep open for them
when they returned from burning farms for the
Empire.
This wholesale rejection of men already more-
or-less picked (in that they had been accepted as
soldiers) recalls the story of the servant-girl at
whom her mistress was jibing for having engaged
herself to a policeman. “ Indade,” replied the
indignant Bridget, “ your husband couldn’t pass
for the polis. My boy did, and a gurrl who gets
a man who’s passed the polis doctor has a guaran-
tee that she’s marrying a rale good man.”

Victorian Railway authorities have been
gradually inquiring for some months into an
alleged sensational assault on an engine-driver by
his guard, while on a moving train ; probably the
result will appear in a year or so. Victoria’s
casual or temporary railway -servants are a queer
lot, and when the engine isn’t running down a
steep place or taking a short cut across a paddock,
or the signalmen playing two up, the train-crew
have fights on the top of the coals in the tender.
There’s a legend in the department of a train
having been once stopped on Keilor plains while
the train-men settled a slight unpleasantness in
six rounds, and the passengers saw fair play and
betted on the result; but that was before the
boom, when people had more time and the roads
were good and a lost hour could be made up.
Nowadays it can’t. Neither engines nor lines can
stand it.

“ F.C." writes : *
The usual holy calm of Melbourne’s Sawbath has been
sadly disturbed of late. The other Sunday half-a-dozen
free entertainments combined with the lovely autumn
weather to seduce people into enjoying themselves. The
May Day movement was one. Then thousands put them-
selves into the hands of little brown mannikins to be
shown over the Jap training-ship. The pale-faced
Scottish regiment went to church in the afternooon in its
kilts—l think it had its kilts on—and it was beautiful,
strolling down Collins-st., to see the House of God
guarded by a couple of sentries with bayonets fixed—it
was so typical of churchianity. Then down at Victoria-st.
Bridge they were fishing for a person in low circumstances,
who had dropped himself over the previous Thursday.
The considerateness of suicides who. take the iong leap
towards the week end, so as to provide fishing exercise on
Sunday afternoon, cannot be too strongly commended.
A large, expectant crowd attended, and the damp and
muddy defunct was duly' recovered at 5 p.m. A pleasant
day finished up with Torrey and “ Guile ” at the Exhibi-
tion. Writer got in early on a ticket issued to non-
church-goers only—most of whom looked it—and, when
the main doors were opened at 7, the rush was like a
stampede of bullocks playing Rugby football. Torrey
and Geil have to thank the papers for their present
boom. Geil is a mass of wearisome reiteration and
hideous repetition ; while Torrey possesses naught but the
painful whine so typical of the man of the monkey shave.
It’s not easy' to see where the profit comes in. The plate
that reached the writer, after passing fully 200 persons,
carried seven threepennies, all told.

N.S.W. District Court Judge HeydoTi has
been guilty of another marked “contempt of
jury.” A man having been found not guilty at
Port Macquarie on a charge of stealing some logs
from a Mr. De Fraine, Judge Heydon said (news-
paper report, which Judge Heydon, since there
was a row, says is inaccurate without specifying
in what particular):
Though the accused had been acquitted, he felt no
reasonable doubt that the logs had been stolen; he was
as certain as a man could possibly be that accused had
stolen them from De Fraine. He ordered, therefore, that
the logs be returned to De Fraine. The verdict of the
jury had helped him to a decision to recommend the
abolition of the Quarter Sessions at Port Macquarie.
Judge Heydon had better give some more con-
vincing explanation than a vague allegation
of inaccuracy against the press, for this
was really a graver “contempt of court” than
any newspaper comment seeking to influence a
jury verdict would be. The jury is an essential
part of the legal system, and the sole judge of the
facts in every case. Mr. Heydon—in brushing
aside a jury verdict and ordering the handing
over to De Fraine of property which was not, in
the eyes of the law, stolen from him, and did not
therefore belong to him—puts himself in a position
which makes Cabinet action a necessity if the
whole legal system i 3 not to be brought into con-
tempt.
THE CASUAL AUS-
TRALIAN: COMING
HOME FROM THE REGISTRY.
BREDE (to bridegroom, whom she has
married on very short acquaintance): “And
what may my name be now, please?”
It is proposed, by a Melbourne newspaper
that the vacant chair of English, French and
German at Melb. University should be handed
over to the present Professor of the dead
languages. The gentleman in question has written
to the press a letter, in which, with much
modesty, he expresses the view that, everything
considered, he must reluctantly admit that he is
a good man for the position, and is willing to
accept it. But the absorption of so many large
and important subjects by one man is surely un-
desirable. Until the University is in funds, the
S resent arrangement is about the best—lectures in
inglish, French and German and a vacant qhair
of modern languages.
Commandant Hutton has damped the
blue-and-gold splendor of Melbourne’s haw-
haw Cavalry Brigade by expressing an authori-
tative hope that the swanking young warriors of
that genteel clan will in due course abandon their
swords and their European notions, and merge
themselves into “the future system of Light
Horse.” From a military point of view Hutton’s
rebuke to the would-be Dragoons is all right
enough, but, if The Bulletin had its way, those
superior creatures would be left alone in their
glory. Now that the vanity of militarism is
seeking concealment under a plain kharki
exterior, Australia really needs a few blue-and-
gold illustrations of the truth to attract the
healthy ridicule of the male vote —and give the.
girls a treat.

The Presbyterian Church of N.S.W. is in
a bad way. Its new Moderator of Assembly,
Rev. John Walker, bewails thedearthof ministers.
The supply is inadequate to the demand. Up to
date there are 38 vacancies, and only 18 ministers
and a few students to fill these positions. Mr.
Walker suggests importing 20 young ministers
from Britain (the Assembly has now decided to
import 10), and shows what a very fine thing it
would be for these youngsters to serve a three
years apprenticeship in bush work before settling
in parishes in Scotland and England. Probably’
it is the dread of being banished to the bush
(coupled with hard thankless work, and small pay)
that prevents young men entering the unpopular
profession.

“Melb.”: The recent snatchmenb of a
£125 diamond ring from Benjamin, the jeweller,
Swanston-st., deserves a little topography for the
outside world. The mere snatching and bolting
is common enough, but I have not met with such
good engineering in this particular line before,
The Orient Hotel, N.E. corner of Bourke and
Swanston-sts., is Poverty Point, moved over there
from the Royal Mail, that being too busy. Next
to the Orient, northward in Swanston-st., is
Tozer’s bicycle shop. Next to Tozer's is Ben-
jamin’s, at the corner of a lane. Up this lane
there is a disused door leading into the Orient
bar. The thief had unlocked this door with a
skeleton key. He bolted therein with the ring,
shutting the door after him. Risky-looking, but
it all came off. Such things do.

The little brown Japs, spent quite a lot of
their Melbourne time at Cole’s Book Arcade,
where the officers, in particular, showed a pro-
found interest in Old King Cole and his genial
spouse. The monarch of the Arcade had ap-
pealed to them with his book of anti-White
Australia policy, also he presented them with
v medals bearing the touching sentiment—
“All men ought to be brothers,” or some-
thing to that effect. His brown brethren
took Mr. Cole very seriously; gave him and
Mrs. C. and daughter a private reception on
the boat, and returned the visit on the
Saturday before they left Melbourne.
Seems that the Japs. had a great time at
the Cole domicile, over the Arcade.
Their hostess and the girls lured them
on to ping-pong, and coached them in
the mysteries of that modern English
pastime until some of them could
ping-pong in the best Gussie style.
One captain sang Jap. songs, an-
other captain gave a Jap. recita-
S tion. Then several officers per-
formed a sort of dumb nautical
tragedy which ended in them
sticking their swords into the
dining-room carpet on the
understanding that each
thrust was effecting the quie-
tus of a Chinese or Russian
foe. The Japanese Night at
Coles’ lasted nearly four hours,
and the captains on leaving
invited their entertainers to
come over to Japan and stay
for six months.

Victorian State schools have been so
severely economised since the boom, that the State
is ruining the health of many children by over-
crowding. At Prahran, Collingwood, Fitzroy
and such places, thousands of children attend the
schools over and above the numbers the buildings
were designed to accommodate. Brunswick
school, built to hold 832 scholars, is daily attended
by an average of 1203, and the actual number on
the roll is 1826. And the state of affairs at Bruns-
wick is by no means as bad as in some other
suburbs. There is legislation to prevent the over-
crowding of theatres for three hours at night,
but the department which puts 1700 undeveloped
young persons to work in a badly-ventilated
building designed to accommodate only 850 meets
with no check from the law.

Whether Sydney Daily Telegraph should be corrected

haler” ? 2. Whether the “ pushing ”or too copious and
rapid administration of an anaesthetic in a closed inhaler
is not, in rare cases, responsible for initial syncope ? 3.
Whether the feeling of suffocation cannot be mitigated
by using chloroform, or by holding the inhaler a short
distance from the face, during the early period of adminis-
tration ? 4. Whether it is not desirable that the subject
be ventilated, even by the “ barking” of a lay woman up

Franklin Peterson, the orthodox person-
age who succeeded Marshall Hall as musical Pro-
fessor at Melb. University, begs to protest against
the error of thoughtless and ignorant people in
associating Beethoven’s Kreutzer sonata with
“Tolstoi’s nasty book.” This very popular error
is “little short of blasphemy ” against Beethoven,
it seems. Prof. Peterson remarks that “ the pre-
eminently healthy, sound sonata has no more to
do with Tolstoi’s book than it would have to do
with ‘The Second Mrs. Tanqueray, for example,
were one of the characters to play a few bars in
the course of .any scene in that delectable picture
of nineteenth century life and manners.” From-
which one may conclude that Prof. Peterson
severely disapproves of Pinero. And yet the
musical world is prepared to heap adoration on
any composer who could even faintly suggest the
changing moods and madnesses of Pinero’s heroine
in a Tanqueray sonata.

bringing the old man along from the Benevolent

The average widower M.P. does not take
kindly to single blessedness. Vic. Govt, whip
Bailes is the latest case in point. He lost his wife
during last session, and the other day turned up
among his friends in Melbourne and informed
them he had come down from Bendigo to marry
again before the re-assembling of Parliament pre-
cluded him from getting away to honeymoon. It
is also rumored that a much older member of the
Assembly has been again enmeshed by sportive
Cupid.

From a Woman’s letter from Broken
Hill
Broken Hill is much bigger than I imagined.
Our hotel is not the grandest, but very
spacious—60 bedrooms, and beautiful furniture
till the dust spoiled it. I cannot convey any
idea of the utter desolation of the sand-
hills —“ sand, still sand, and only sand, and
sand and sand again.” Yet in Spring, for a
few weeks, Sturt’s scarlet pea makes a
short-lived glory. And the dwellings of the
miners—such makeshift homes ! At their
worst a few kerosene tins and bags, which
seem to have been blown together by a
high wind, or a kind of cellar partly in and
partly out of the ground. And very often,
from the miners’ hall, a black flag flying at half-mast. This
means death ; and if a red one waves under it, accident
the cause. Death and fires are the only things that
matter at Broken Hill. A shattered arm or leg is a mere
detail. Already, unconsciously, I talk the miners’ slang,
and call lunch “crib.” Tne children will ask you,
“Where is she to?” Eyes, ears, and nose are in a con-
tinual state of irritation ; and my hair is nothing but a
sand net. All the folks here who are not civil servants
work in the mines. No, I was nearly forgetting. There
is a third community, which lives on “Convent Hill,”
and holds meetings to discuss which newcomer it will
call on. There are but few Cornstalks here -mostly S.
Australians, and proud, inordinately proud, of their “ no
birthstain.” Who could compete with such innocence?

Absorption in the work of one’s own par-
ticular “beat ” was well illustrated in the case of
an unstriped constable catechised lately in a
Sydney court by a heckling solicitor. The con-
stable admitted he did not know the name of the
present Premier, or what the Commonwealth is ;
he had heard of Mr. Barton and thought he owned
horses, but didn’t know what he did for a living ;
he thought he won the Melbourne Cup “some
time back”; he swore he never read a
Sydney daily paper; when he wanted
news lie took Tit-Bits ; he didn’t know
“ wan church from anither,” but volun-
teered the admission that he believed
most of them were “ dacint ”; he took
all his instructions from the “sargint”
t and didn’t bother about the Inspec-
tor-General or other ‘ ‘ great people. ”
He knew how many people lived in
every house on his beat, however,
and was ready to minutely describe the
length of their hair and the color of their
eyes.

Melbourne Herald makes a tremendous
fuss over certain damaged members of the later

mercenaries at the Imperial

the Imperial pension of Is. 6d.

in any case, Is. 6d. a day is

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ . Sydney, May 20, 1902.
Mt Dear Arini,—
Just when I was getting the Akenehi diamonds
reset, m anticipation of the ’Governor-General's
presence here during the winter, all hopes were
nipped by the frosty intelligence that he has
resigned. It is now unlikely that he will come
here at all before hi-s departure, for he has told
the Coronation ball committee that he will not be
in Sydney for that event. The Hopetouns will
keep Coronation Day in Melbourne, or at least
half of it; the other half, like Sunday, going to
divine service, which seems rather dreary for both
Melbourne and the Hopetouns. Australia flat-
tered herself that the G.-G. had taken his big
billet with a glad heart, had, indeed, chased it on
account of his health. But a certain Aus-
tralian, who is now back in Sydney, was in the
lobby of the H. of C. when Lord Hopetoun’s
appointment was announced, and Mr. Austin
Chamberlain coming in at the moment, the Aus-
tralian remarked upon the wise choice his father
had made. To which A.C. made answer that his
father had had great difficulty in getting Hope-
toun to take the billet. “He was proof against
all arguments,” said the younger Orchid, “and
only gave way to an outright appeal to his
patriotism.” But, of course, that is always the
story. A Governor is like a clergyman—never
runs after a job; is always “ called ” to it.
For refusing to bleed money to maintain an
Imperial style for the Hopetouns, Mr. Chamber-
lain, it would seem, proposes to flog the Common-
wealth with a Scotch thistle. Balfour of Burleigh,
named as a likely successor to Lord Hopetoun, is
a representative Scotch peer, in stature as burly
as his name would imply. A man who has
bumped against the Balfour in his travels tells me
that the latter is a dismal person, who affects
closely-cut mutton-chop whiskers, and as he in-
variably travels third-class in the underground
railway, when on his way to Parliament, he is
regarded as one of the “closest” men in the
Sided chamber. The aristocracy of Sydney and
bibourne will, my informant predicts, not be
spoilt by lavish hospitality if Balfour of
Burleigh, originally Robert Bruce, becomes
our gazetted Governor - General : “If the
said Bruce does not save at least a quarter
of his annual salary I, who saw something
of him and have heard a great deal about
him, will be much surprised.” The title was
attainted in 1715, and was only restored to the
present owner in 18G9. He is 53, and is married
to a daughter of the fifth Earl of Aberdeen.
About the future Governor-General’s salary
trouble, a way out seems to be indicated by the
fact that Society keeps its own census. Every-
body who is “anybody” writes his or her name
in the Visitors’ Book, thus signifying willingness
to eat, drink, dance and dissipate at the Governor’s
invitation and the public expense. Why not hand
the book over periodically to the’ Treasury
officials, and have the signatories called upon to
provide the entertaining part of the Governor’s
screw ? The people could then pay him, sav,
£2OOO a year for his public foundation-stone-laving
duties, and society add to it what sum society
pleased for entertaining.
The supply of well-known persons for matri-
monial engagement purposes seems to keep
up. I suppose it is because all mankind loves
a lover, that those who don’t even know the
engaged persons take a personal interest in their
engagement. What is she like and what—o
sordid world I—are his prospects ? As many
details of the accepted addresses as can be
gathered, then the commentators give their per-
mission, so to speak, and the pair may hurry up
with the settlements and trousseau.
Engagement of Captain Watt to Miss Muriel
Williams is a “popular” one. The bridegroom’s
family is interested in shipping and commerce;
he himself has some thousands a year, is an
A.D.C. to acting-Governor Darley, a lieutenant
in the Scottish Rifles, and an English University
man. The captain looks a clean, sane and mode-
rately brainy young man, with a profile that will
scan like a verse of moderately good poetry.
(N.B. If your profile is weak, or snubby, or gar-
goylish, never severely test it, as many do, by
outlining it against the curtains of a theatre-box
for a whole audience to criticise. Someone there
is sure to remark that your face would look better
upside-down.) Miss Williams, second daughter
of the Justice of that name, wears Gainsborough
hats with a Romney air, and is described by the
paragraphers as a handsome, “dashing” girl. I
would greatly like a definition of “ dashing,” also
its origin. It is a detestable word with which to
adjectivise a lady.
Another popular engagement is that of one of
the Osbornes of Currandooley (is that name
aboriginal or is it double-barrelled Irish?) to Miss
Anderson, eldest daughter of the steamship man,
Mr. David Anderson. So the two best-looking
girls in Victoria and this State will pluck their
orange-blossoms in the same season.
For the last fortnight Sunday church services
of all denominations have been better attended
than usual. Even on week days worshippers may
be found in the churches. As there is no religious
revival on here, the parsons are forced to the
conclusion that Mt. Pelee is the cause of the
increased devotion. A large number of quite
worthy persons become religious through terror,
and now that local geologists have told us that we
have quite a supply of extinct craters at hand
(there’s one at Hornsby, about nine miles from
Sydney), and that there is a possibility of these
going into business again, it may be that Sydney
will need to increase its church accommodation'
and _ reduoe its police foroe. Talk about diplo-
matic evasions: a Roman Catholic priest geolo-
gist, who was one of the interviewed, takes the
laya-cake. In reply to the Herald inquisitor, he
said: “Not long ago, geologically ” (italics mine)
‘volcanic fires dotted this country from Mt.
Tomah and Mt. Hay to the coast.” “ Can you
give that date approximately in years?” bleated
the inquirer. _ “It is not at all improbable,” mur-
mured the priest, “that when the latest of our ex-
tinct volcanoes were active on the continent—the
aborigines may have already come to the country.”
With that Biblical 6000 years story hanging over
him and the coadjutor-archbishop sitting around,
he had to be cautious. But one can almost see
the priest nudging the scientist.
Presbyterian General Assamblyite3, in dis-
cussing allotments in cemeteries last week, got off
several humorous tombstone anecdotes. The
Moderator told of a widow (probably Scotch), in
an Australian town, who had erected a valuable
monument over the grave of her late husband.
By-and-bye she asked for permission to remove
the memorial, as “she thought it might be turned
to more useful and practical account.” Her re-
quest vyas not allowed, but it would indeed be
interesting to know the widow’s real reason for
wishing to remove the marble pile. What had
she found out about her late Sandy ? Or was she
about to re-marry, and saw in the monument the
price of a second trousseau ? If widows and
widowers waited a year before planting the grave
of the departed mate with inscribed marble,
cemeteries would be barer than they are, and
inscriptions colder reading.
Every musician, .every music-lover, in fact all
artistic Sydney is mourning the death of Sydney
Moss; and hundreds who cared nothing for Art
liked the man himself. He was the greatest
musical force in this State; he was also one of the
most modest and unostentatious of charitable
men. Mr. Moss was 43 years of age and died
suddenly of a rheumatic affection of the heart on
Wednesday night week, perhaps at the very time
that the Amateur Orchestral Society, which he
founded, was playing the music of “Geuoveva,”
which he had loaned to it. When his sister, Miss
Moss, who lived with him, returned from the
concert she found her brother lying dead on the
floor. Mr. Moss, who studied his art in Europe,
was a son of the late Mr. Lewis Moss, who at one
time owned a large music warehouse in Hunter-
street, Sydney.
The Stygian Night in aid of the Victor Daley
Testimonial Fund was a great success. There
was a fine attendance of mourners, and an impres-
sive gloom hung over the scene. On entering the
hall one involuntarily looked for the coffin, on
leaving it one glanced about for the grim black
steeds. The poet himself was not present—for-
tunately. Had he been, his metrical output
henceforth would have been solely in-memoriam
verses. A Bohemian Night, when mismanaged
by persons with great talents for disorganisation,
always resolves itself into a successful Stygian
Night. In forgetting to take out a license for toe
bar, the hardworking honorary undertaker erred
mildly. But not having a private still secreted
somewhere in the building was a grievous error.
The price of admission might have been raised
and have included visits to the source of potheen.
Ihen tne “night’" would have been a financial
success, and as for its Bohemianism—there never
would have been such a night, Bohemian or
Florentine.
American vaudevillers who visit us seem to have
a strong leaning towards the widower as a theme
for pathos in song and screen-pictures. In fact,
no American variety show seems complete without
one whose darling has just passed away, leaving
him sad and lonely, and thinking in song (and
showing on the screen) of the places where they
met, and cooed, and lived. Mr. Neil M‘Cay, at
Sydney Palace, is the latest songful widower. He
sings against the background of his “lonely home,”
a mansion in _ Millionaire Row, with at least 150
rooms, all brilliantly lighted. No wonder “ Sue
from old Kentucky” died young; that house
would kill any blue-grass girl. By the way,
couldn’t the management of the Palace secure Mr!
Peacock, the Vic. Premier, for a laughing
“turn?” Mr. Peacock, whose laugh is to him
what its pearls are to the sea, was at the Palace
last week, and simply demoralised both enter-
tainers and audience with his jackass note.
The literary interest of those programmes
which Sydney Amateur Orchestral Society dis-
tributes at its concerts makes for rivalry with the
concerts themselves. At the first concert of its
11th season last week the “large and fashionable
audience ” had its finely-coiffed head buried in its
programme reading about ‘Genoveva,” the lady
whose Crusader husband turned her out into the
forest where a doe nursed her infant, whilst the
was playing Schumann’s orchestral
masterpiece, the overture to the opera “ Geno-
veva.” Instead of listening for the music to tell
the story of love and suffering, the audience pre-
ferred to read that the overture had these quali-
ties. Same studiousness was observable when the
“ soul drama,” Beethoven’s Symphony in C minor
came under the conductor’s wand. And if in the
finale, with its Niagarianroar of music, theaudience
did not discern the soul of Beethoven mounting
to heaven in a chariot of fire,” it was flattered to
think that the Orchestral Society, and especially
the gentleman who wrote the notes, thought it
did. Miss Sylvia Blackstone, the voealiste of the
night, in an amber gown with yellow baby roses
in her hair, trilled operatically in Italian from
Romeo and Juliet, and later, gave Coenen’s
Spring Song. A fifth of the applause she got
would have fetched Carlo Dani back four times
but the little contralto declined “another.”
The Aurania, with 1300 returned troops on
board, will arrive in Sydney about the end of the
month, and they will be entertained in Sydney
Town Hall at a smoke concert with free drinks
and other things. The politicians are running the
show ; they always run when they have to deal
with large bodies of men, before whom they can
patriotically posture in a full house. When the
men come back in dribs and drabs they get a cold
welcome—neither a cheer nor a drink.
Lieut.-Governor Darley has had so many re-
lapses since his serious illness in December last
that Dr. Fiaschi has advised a postponement of
the C.J.’s trip to England, so the passage taken
by the Sonoma for June 3rd has been cancelled.
Last week the C. J. was very ill, but since Sunday
his condition has markedly improved.
The confessions of a Potts Point young lady in
the servant-girl’s weekly suggests many' painful
The “Pointer” tells us how she spends
her £5O a year dress-allowance. She buys ten
dresses, besides blouses, skirts, and wrappers, but
only two “combinations.” When one is at the
wash, and she by any chance falls (say) off a ferry-
boat, or gets soaked through on a wet day, there
seems nothing for her but to go to bed, and this
would be a very cold solution, as she does not,
seemingly, buy even one nightdress. A “lady ”
who buys two evening-dresses and two “boas,”
and no night-gown, on a dress allowance of £5O,
is just the sort of lydy the organ in question
cater 3 for.
Wherever you take your suburban walks abroad
after 7 p.m. these nights you will hear male voices
singing in the boarding-houses, and the song will
be either the “Holy City” or “La Donne e
Mobile.” In a six-house terrace over the water,
on a recent night, four of the houses were being
“Holy Citied.” The way those North Whore
Danis let out the Jee-ru-sal euras and Hose
Annas spoke well for their own self-reverence and
their landladies’ self-control.
An American darkie formerly ran a restaurant
in Sydney, but now chases the Govt, minimum
wage of 7s. a day as laborer. Explains his downfall
thus : “ jfou see, 1 got sick, sold out, and went
up country. I was mighty ill, and women
wouldn t look at me because I’m black, except a*
widow, and she was kind to me, and looked after
me, so I married her. She had twelve children,
and that’s a mighty big handicap on a man.”
“It was a stately convent, with new and lofty
walls. It was also a fashionable Sydney boarding-
school. Nearly every girl there had a brother
boarding at a high-priced college nearer the city.
Someone suggested that the brothers ought to
visit their sisters one afternoon a week. It was
done. A regiment of youths filed into a big re-
ception room where their sisters sat in a hollow
square. A nun telling tier beads stood at the head
of the room. She clapped her hands, the girls
rose, and each indicated to her brother the vacant
chair at the side of her own. Brothers and sisters
were paired nicely. There was a low buzz
of chat, a nun telling her beads for an hour.
Next visit the youths turned up sharp to time
and the procedure was same as before, save that
no brotner took the chair his sister indicated. He
took the cnair near the other fellow’s sister. Of
course, some one told by-aud-bye, and the sweet
communion was stopped.
Do not forget that the Fresh Air League Ball
takes place on the 27th. New State Governor
Rawson will be present with wife and daughter.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent
“ Our golden iads and lasses are not feeling too
much cut up at the near prospect of saying ‘ ta-ta’
to the Hopetouns. It’s their pa’s and ma’s who
will miss the Gov.-General’s entertaining more.
Govt. House functions are chilly, elderly parties,
of which nobody is more tired than the host and
hostess. It costs £3O to light up Melb. Govt.
House ballroom for one night, so Lord Hopetoun
tola an interviewer, ana tne people thus expen-
sively illuminated are the same old push, who
face the music each season, coining up smiling the
same old stereotyped smile. Every year the high-
priced ’lectncs are turned on to show them up a
little older, a little greyer, a little more portly, a
little bolder, a little duller, a little slower than
they were the year before. How dreary Aus-
tralian society is ! An everlasting hunt after
free champagne and turkey oy the same set of
‘ wealthy lower orders,’ of over-paid officials, and
their over-dressed, over-fed, over-jewelled, over-
bearing wives.
“The Austral Salon now wears a halo on its
homely head. The Countess descended upon it,
and smiled, and endeavored to re-assure a fearful
and awe-stricken assemblage of members and
friends, last Thursday afternoon. The more
frozen the Salon became the more unbending
proyed the Countess, who congratulated songstress
Olive Kingston in her sweetest tone of interest,
and even said something nice about a sharp little
penwoman’s lecturette on some subject undreamt
of in our philosophy. In the evening a brighter
element feigned, and the Salon emerged from its
afternoon phill with.,kindling face to bask in the
light and color and sound of Miss Unie Russell’s
entertainment. The programme was really
attractive. Olive Kingston alone would have
recompensed one for any kind of oefore and after
items, and her deliciously-artistic number from
‘Lucia’ was helped by one of the most scintillating
and happy frock effects that tne Salon has seen for
many a day—shell-pink snimmering silk veiled in
silver-spangled net. Olive Kingston’s voice is the
daintiest and Frenohiest in the Commonwealth to
many people’s way of thinking. The quality is
soft, velvety, caressing, the range considerable,
and the method of production Marehesi’s own.
Walter Kirby was another warbler ready to make
amends for any flaws m the programme, but his
‘Silvery Bells of Shandon’were marred in their
delicate ringing by the accompaniment. The
young hostess gave the Mad Scene from
‘ Hamlet ’in luminous style. She looked Ophelia
m her fragile prettiness, with the palest of gold
hair, and she lived it absolutely. Again in
‘ Henry V.’ Unie Russell let the light of her talent
upon the part of Princess. Katherine with delight-
ful results. Mrs. Lewis swash buckled about as
Henry, but retained her petticoats, and Miss
Gillespie, as Alice, served as a dark foil to
Katherine the fair.
“ Sassiety didn’t seem to know that the Findon
Harriers’ meeting was taking place at Moonee
V alley last W ednesday. Two spacious tents yawned
hugely in the Reserve, and hardly a soul to stop the
gap. People point to the sad failure of this Findon
Hunt Club meeting as a sign of what the season’s
functions are going to do. It is said over and over
again that Society isn’t going to spend anything
on its chiffons when the most ornate flutterers are
off junketting at the Royal shivoo. It is going to
be a season of self-denial, of fast and abstinence
from dress-shows.
“ Alfred Deakin was ‘star’ spokesman at the
opening of that new wing of the Queen Victoria
Hospital, t’other day, by Guv’nor Clarke’s helpful
mate. Sargood, of the chiffons, who talks as a
tailor’s foreman writes, made one of his blotless
speeches in the style of ledger lucidity; then
Alfred the Orator sprang to his feet and rattled
off a flower-sprinkled monologue. He is so
nimble, is Alfred, the Acting Prime Minister.
The silver coin rolls off his tongue from the
mental mint more rapidly almost than one can
collect it. He often talks small change rather
than silver, but his words have a ring all the same.
The Governor’s wife was a fine figure. She had
given the eternal grey a rest, and made a sensible
bid for sartorial fitness in a deep claret-colored
cloth gown, and a velvet and lace toque of the same
bibulous hue. Miss Clarke was in black and white.
Attractive nurses with large collecting-boxes can-
vassed the silver-chain-pursed crowd.
“ Melb. women of all ages have developed lately
a painful craze for ‘ doing up.’ Louise Mack says
that Queen Alexandra’s make-up is the most
palpable thing about her. So our loyal citizen-
esses are building up their complexions on loyal
lines. Knowing ones say there’s an art that
conceals art, by massage and electricity, no rouge
or dye needed ; but that art hasn’t arrived
in this city, so far. At a recent high-toned bun-
scramble some of the women’s heads looked like
badly burnt-off paddocks, half sage-green, half
b'ack. One lady’s thatch was dull-red, like
the inside of an old iron kettle; another
sallow, dark-eyed beauty carried a tawny mane
which looked like that of a ‘ new ’ lioness, try-
ing to usurp the hairy privileges of the lion.
It’s a scientific touch, you know, to get a high
light on the nose, which attracts the eye of the
beholder away from the hollow cheeks,’ so some
geese chalk a white line straight down their noses
and another at right angles along the upper lip.
Lavender is the favorite face-color just now—at
least, it comes out at that, when the cold winds,
and the hot tea, and the tight boots, and the pink
paint all get in their deadly work on the victim’s
face.
“ A society charmer, who played the tyrant to
her adoring fiance, has suddenly been left lament-
ing. The gentleman, who follows the legal pro-
fession, took umbrage at last at her treatment,
and allowed himself to fall in love with a certain
fair, undowered angel, whom he snapped up
promptly and married. That pretty and cruel
society girl is merely left a sad memory and a fine
dose of chagrin for her undue coyness.
“Kindergartens, Kitchens and Clubs are
amongst the proposed distractions of the
coming winter evenings. During last week
I have been asked by daintily got-up circulars
to join all three. The kindergartners are a branch
of the Psychological Society, and study childhood
scientifically, as the above jawbreaking title im-
plies. Every infant in this enlightened twentieth
century is to be studied as a separate Soul. The
old vulgar days of correction with the maternal
slipper in the family woodshed are to be numbered
with the painful past. The distributing-kitchen,
which will trundle one’s dinner along, ready
cooked, in a motor car, seems to be filling a long-
felt want, for the idea is growing apace. The
writers’ ciub has now a local habitation in an
Elizabetb-st. tea-room, and seems to be doing as
well as can be expected.
“Two rival amateur shows are swelling their
sails for a voyage on the stage. The excitement
runs high, so do the dressmakers’ bills. Massag-
ing, manicuring, deportment lessons, private
dancing lessons, special singing lessons, are only
a few of the preparations going on in the mimic
mummers’ circles of sassiety. The Palotta fas-
cinations are in full rehearsal. The Blanche
Wallace hip-movement is being hourly practised,
the dimples of Florence Young and the fetching
eyes of Carrie Moore are being emulated by the
most diligent of the girls. The prunes and prisms
lessons of seven years ago are never heard of now-
adays, and girls must learn to bounce and swagger
to be successful in society.
“ Middle-aged men swear by the ‘ Wrong Mr.
Wright’—perhaps because therein beauteous
Roxy Barton loses her heart to a bald, double-
chinned wooer. When she declares she ‘could
never love a boy of 30 or 35,’ patriarchial counten-
ances present shine with satisfaction. Men can’t
be so conceited as they get credit for, or they
wouldn’t need a playwright to tell them, at this
time of day, that up to —say 55, all have a fair
field and no favor in Woman’s good graces, at
least so far as age considerations are concerned.

The United Typewriter and Supplies Co.,
one of the largest concerns manufacturing type-
writers, seems to be getting more of its share of
the world’s business. One of its machines, the
“Yost,” was favoured recently by the Indian
Government with an order for one hundred and
twenty machines. In addition to this their
Australian representative now reports the sale of
five hundred “ New Century ” Typewriters for use
on the Government Railways. An important
fact is that these two are record orders for the
world, and, what is more important in the eyes of
the Company, were obtained in competition with
all, the leading makes. Australian buyers can
obtain both of these machines from the Company’s

PERSONAL ITEMS.
Evang«,./st Geil says that “ Judas Iscariot
was a large fat man.”
Lord Hopetoun has just resigned in time.
Bun Tuck Seddon can now have himself appointed
Governor-General of Australia.
There is some betting in interested quar-
ters as to whether Cardinal Moran and Dr.
O’Haran will return to Australia from Rome.
Cardinal Moran’s name is mentioned in
connection with three or four different big Papal
billets, and an interview published in Sydney
Freeman’s Journal seems to suggest that he will
score one or other of them.
John See affects to be, and has been told
that he is, the most polished speaker at the head
of N.S.W. public affairs since W. B. Dailey
officiated as Acting-Premier. “ I abstain from
Reid’s buffoonery,” says Mr. See, grandiosely.
S.A. Govt, is trying to secure a Coronation
knighthood for millionaire Angus in recognition
of bis public gifts. Squatter Barr-Smith, who
has also been most open-handed with his money,
has intimated that he has no desire for a bauble.
Missionary Paton, the apostle of the South
Seas, will be 78 years old on Saturday of this
week (24th). Mr. Adye Douglas, of Tasmania,
will, on Friday, May 30, complete his 87th year,
and Senator Sargood will be 68 on the
Bame day.
The “baby” of new S.A. Parliament is
F. W. Young, a juvenile solicitor who captured
the rustic votes in the north with his eloquence
and powers of repartee. “ You are a representa-
tive of the National Ass,” said a Port Pirie
elector. “ Well,” said Young, “ that’s infinitely
better than being merely the local one ! ”
The late John Danks, the Melbourne
brass-founder, seems to have found plenty of
brass for the family. * Danks’ will and testament
was lately proved at £195,000 or so, the result of
“strict attention to business,” and a steady in-
disposition to live expensively. Danks was a
decent old chap in his evangelical way.
G. R. Dibbs is still fond of describing
how he was captured after he had been condemned
in libel costs to the tune of about £BOOO, which, on
principle, he declined to pay. The refusal
being contempt of court, the judges sent
him up for twelve months imprison-
ment in the debtors’ ward. Dibbs had
a town and a country house. He
cleared all his furniture, paint-
ings, &c., to the latter, at
Emu Plains. He was there
when a couple of court
bailiffs turned up one
night to “ take his
body.” As Dibbs stands
77 inches in his socks,
and then weighed about
18st., the bailiffs—
wizened old men and
weak—were lomewhat
taken back when the
big man coolly got into
bed and said: “Go on
and take me.” Dibbs
firmly declined to go
until he was “taken,”
but at last agreed to a
compromise. ‘ ‘ Look
here, men, there’s \
plenty of food
and whisky in
the house. You
stop here for a
few days and
help me hang
the pictures up,
and put the
house straight
for my wife and
family, and then
I’ll go down to
Sydney with
you.” The bailiffs
fell to willingly
enough, every-
thing was put
shipshape, and
the three went
off to gaol amic-
ably together.
The death of
George Anstey at
80 years revives
memories of one
of Australia’s bra Vest
pioneers. Anstey was
a Mitchell man in the
explorations of over 60
years ago. Pastoral
Queensland was literally
discovered by Mitchell,
and his name spots the
western country still.
He died at Darling
Point, Sydney, half a
century ago, but left
several of his “men ” to narrate
his exploits. Mitchell, possessor of many fine quali-
ties, was unduly addicted to treating his fellow-
workers as “men.” But the vice was amply
atoned for by a masculine independence in other
respects. He threw up his seat in N.S.W. Parlia-
ment of his day when the “classes” tried to tie
his hands. Three other of Mitchell’s “ men ” sur-
vive Anstey, it is said. Anstey had numbers of
good stories about the early days, but, like most
pioneer stories, corroboration is hard to get.
Sain. Winter, of Melb. Herald, erstwhile
Australia’s champion objurgator, not long ago
apologised at a carnival gathering for red-hot
ebullitions in the past, and accounted for his
becoming meek as a lamb. It was all through
getting properly fitted with spectacles, he said.
Archbishop Catr, of Melbourne, is, as
Cardinal Moran a couple of years ago hinted,
likely to get the next pair of red stockings sent to
Australia. Melbourne will, while the Federal
Parliament sits there, rank to foreigners as the
Australian capital ; and, besides, Archbishop
Kelly has yet to win his spurs as an ecclesiastical
administrator.
The plucky feat of chief officer Hayman,
of s.s. Boveric, and the three members of his
crew in voyaging 1500 miles in a lifeboat ap-
proaches Bligh’s famous 2000 miles open-boat trip
after the Bounty mutiny. Of course Hayman
had the advantage of being well provisioned; the
unfortunate Bounty men were limited to half a
biscuit a day.
Clever Arthur Streeton —who has been
taken up by that well-known picture-dealing and
publishing firm, the Agnews—is on the road to
success in London. Charles Conder, also formerly
of Sydney, has just had a most successful exhibi-
tion in Paris, where his painted fans are famous
and command great prices. And A. H. Full wood
is selling some pictures in London at decent
prices.
Sad, but true, that Lord Hopetoun, when
in Adelaide, practically denied the rumor that he
was returning to England, although the thing was
all arranged with Chamberlain before he (Lord
H.) went on his visit to that city. Joe evidently
wanted to bluff the Commonwealth into raising the
vice-regal salary and allowances, while Hopetoun
would probably have returned to England early
in any Case.
The burial at Watson’s Bay the other day
of Mr. A. H. Unwin (who died after a long and
gallant struggle with consumption) practically
closes the Governor Loftus chapter in the personal
history of N.S. W. Mr. Unwin was the Governor’s
private secretary and did much to make that
Eotentate look more gracious to “ society ” than
e really was. Sydney Govt. House was then a
hearthstone of cliques, and one of Lord Loftus’s
redeeming virtues was that he despised the cliques
as much as they despised one another. Lady
Loftus left everything to the judgment of Unwin,
who afterwards entered the Public Service.
A NEW SENSATION.
THE LANDLORD: “ Got the rent? ”
A RTIST: “ Yes, I have it to-day. Would you
mind coming inside and sitting down for
three or four hours —I want to gaze my fill
on a softened and satisfied rent-man.”
BRADDON OF THE BLOT.
It turns out now that the German mis-
sionary Hesse, on a charge of shooting whom
Morant and Handcock, of the Buccaneers, were
tried and acquitted, was not a German at all, but
an Africander and a British subject. Had this
been discovered earlier, probably nothing would
have been heard of the shooting of Boer prisoners,
and Morant and Handcock would be now wearing
D.S.O. after their names.
The Radical-Republican senators shock
many people in the Federal Parliament, but none
so much as ancient door-keeper Lennox. The
old man came out to Australia many years ago as
butler to a Vic. Governor, and has ever since
retained in full vigor all the instinct of an English
retainer of the aristocracy. If mental torture
were taken into account Lennox would have his
salary at least doubled forthwith.
Some lively figures have been published as
to what Australia has been paying for her
Governor-General. So far that small thin gentle-
man has cost £30,000 for 18 months—about £25,000
a year. This amount has been either paid over or
pledged and doesn’t include cost of repairs and
maintenance of the Government houses at Sydney
and Melbourne. And even then the Hopetoun
claims to be £ll,OOO out of pocket.
Manchester Guardian (judging from a
somewhat puzzle-headed cable) seems to think
that one cause of Hopetoun’s resignation was the
interference with his duties by the State Gover-
nors, who, at the suggestion of Mr. Chamberlain,
were “taking an active interest” in Australian
military affairs. The opinion has the color of
truth; the choice of military or naval men iovall
the State Governorships has surely an object.
Mrs. King, widow of Archdeacon King who
died a few years ago, aged 74, at “Rockville,” Stan-
more, Sydney, died last week in the same house,
also at 74. She was a daughter of James Raymond
who held the belt as N.S.W. Postmaster-General.
“Jimmy ” clung to the office from 1829 to 1851.
Archdeacon King was grandson of Gov. King of
the early days, and was a Sydney native. He
went to school to Dean Cowper, now awaiting
death, but afterwards studied at an English
University.
A Scotchman, Dr. M‘lntyre Sinclair, has
been selected as Resident Medical Officer of
N.S.W. Consumptives’ Home. The position was
largely advertised throughout the States, in
Great Britain, on the Continent of Europe,
and in America, and although 26 applications
were received not one came from an Australian, or
from any man holding Australian degrees. Sixteen
calne from Great- Britain, four from Germany,
four from the United States, one from Austria,
and one from Fiji. .......
Tom Durkin, who died the other week,
narrowly escaped being an inventor all the time
he was a black-and-white artist. During the last
years of his life, when he had practically ceased to
work for the press, Durkin had always got some in-
vention on hand which was going to make the
fortune of everyone who would put a pound or two
into it. The poor fellow found a good many
people to subscribe towards his fad of the moment.
Some of them believed, or professed to believe in
Durkin’s chance of success and helped him
accordingly. Faith, Hope and Charity are very
good friends to struggling “inventors”—but the
greatest of these is Charity.
London Times sees a difficulty in obtaining
competent men for the Australian Governorship
at the paltry rate of £lO,OOO a year. But what
sort of men have we had for far less than £lO,OOO
a year? What about old Hercules Robinson at
his best ? Or George Bowen in Yiotoria, standing
between hostile and impudent Toryism on the
one hand and Radicalism, eager to cut the
painter, on the other? Or Richard Bourke,
taking the old flogging, convict-owning gang
by the throat? Or George Gipps (ability
his only redeeming feature) beating Went-
worth on the floor of the Council Chamber
in a debate whose issue involved the destiny of
Maoriland ? Or Bligh, crushed at last by the
N.S.W. convict guard ? Hopetoun never was,
and never can.be, in the same category with
those men. The ability expected of a Governor
nowadays by the Times seems to be only ability
to “ grease the fat sow.”
David Syme has of late become quite a
social butterfly, and the name of the sombre
newspaper boss frequently appears nowadays in
paragraphs about official functions.
David even went so far as to enter-
tain Barton at dinner before the
“Noblest Son’s” departure for the island
of Chamberlain, and the Federal and
State personages who were there say that
he put aside his austerity for the nonce
and became quite genial and pawky.
But surely there is something wrong
when David forgets that his dictatorial
power in Vic. affairs was builded upon the
rock of a political hermitage, to which pil-
grimages could only be made by those who were
peremptorily summoned ! The contempt bred of.
familiarity is more likely to fall upon the Age
ruler, now that he is stooping with his years, than
in the old days when his mental acuteness was
allied to wiry and indomitable bodily strength.
An unpublished story of Australia’s friend,
the Jookoyork, during his first visit to this
country, in ’B2. He and his .late brother,
then midshipmen, were taken to the big
Hustlers’ mine, Bendigo. The frail Eddy
did not like the idea of venturing into the
bowels of the earth, and stayed on
top, but George went down, and wan-
dered through the workings under the
guidance of an old miner. Descending a
ladder at the end of a drive, George
thought it . would be a great joke to tread
on the fingers of the miner who was going
before him. The man stood it for two steps.
Then, satisfied that the action was inten-
tional, he stopped, and scandalised a long line of
loyal persons by remarking, “ Look ’ere, young
feller, if you tread on my fingers again, I’ll kick
” and so on. For the rest of the trip George
kept his humor under severe restraint.
In “ Bushman and Buccaneer,” a shilling
book just published in Sydney, there is thrown
much new light on the character and life of Harry
Morant (“ The Breaker ”). The writer, who has
had access to much valuable documentary evi-
dence, gives many new facts as to the doings of
the Bushveldt Carbineers. It is more than
suggested that the officers executed got much
less than a “ fair deal.” The allegation that the
Boer prisoners were shot by order of the English
authorities is now more than a mere rumor : it is
supported by very good authority. The whole
matter should be probed to the bottom.
The luck of J. T. Whelan, ex-Queensland
cohentingenter! He went to S’Africa as a private
with the first Queensland contingent under Col.
Ricardo. In 1900 he joined the Criminal Investi-
gation Dept, at Pretoria. Now he is chief of the
department and has married Mrs. Tjaard Kruger,
the widowed daughter-in-law of ex-President
Kruger. This will make him more than rich, as
Mrs. Whelan is the possessor of one of the finest
residences in Pretoria, and in addition owns ex-
tensive estates in other places. The happy couple
are just now honey-mooning in Europe. This
news should cause a fresh outburst of “dis-
interested patriotism” in Queensland, for there
must be other wealthy widows in S’Africa,
The Sangster episode in Victoria (Sangster,
Labor M.P. and secretary of the Seamen’s Union,
having a shortage of .£lB7 in his accounts, squared
tho matter with a cheque signed by Malcolm
M'Eacharn of all people in the world ! —proceeds
of the sale of scrip, Mr. Sangster says the cheque
was) is an unhappy echo of the Burdekin episode
in N.S. W. The official Labor paper, the Work-
man, was found to have “borrowed” =BlOO from
millionaire Burdekin on the eve of his contesting
an election. If Australian Labor parties wish to
keep their influence, they must avoid not only
evil, but even the appearance of it. Mr. Sang-
ster, whatever the rights or wrongs of his case,
should walk right out of the Labor movement.
James Dick, the Glasgow rubber and
mining millionaire (proprietor, among many other
things, of Mitchell’s Freehold Mine, N.S.W.),
left handsome legacies to all his Scotch employees:
cashier, £5000; clerks and managers of depart-
ments, £5OO each; women workers, 30 years’
service, £3OO each ; 20 years’ service, £lOO each,
and lesser periods, £5O each ; men workers, 40
years’ service, £lOO each ; 20 years, £75 each ; 15
years, £5O each, and lesser periods, £3O each;
cook, £2000; housemaid, coachman and gardener,
£lOOO each. Not known yet whether Mr. Dick
made any provision for his trusted officials and
advisers in Australia.

PREHISTORIC ’STRALYA.—OLD-AGE PENSION REFUSED.
Concerning certain Far Northern niggers,
“ The Wreck ” writes:—
Ed. Bulletin.— jße Roth v. “Trotter” (8., 12/4/’O2)
both protest too much. I sympathise with Dr. Roth.
It’s pure cheek for irresponsible travellers to have doubts
as to the benefit Dr. R.’s rule confers on a race who can’t
state their own case in the papers and are too pagan to
act as informers on those who supply their miserable
lives with that which a benevolent Gov't, declines to give
them— i.e., a taste of heaven. Seeing that Messrs. Meston
and Roth make periodical visits to Brisbane to explain
their views on the quality of their own work, irreverent
folk of the “ Trotter ” brand should be muzzled.
Judging from notes of a recent tour—coast from
Townsville to Cooktown, via Daintree River—along
Laura River, through Palmer, Mitchell, Walsh, Chillagoe,
Garnet, Kangaroo Hills. &c.—the blacks are very well
looked after. All young gins, barring the “ trooper’s
specials,” are kidnapped and sent to (allegedly) Bellenden
Ker—about which there are “ vague rumors and strong
beliefs ” —or supplied to squatters and other householders
as domestic servants. Cooktown takes the bun for black
domestics, and present writer saw there an aboriginal
suckling a white child (Australian, anyhow). No Chinese
camp is minus its gins. The unpresentable and decrepit
have to hustle for themselves. Govt, relief, comprising
an occasional dole of flour (somewhat less than 2oz. per
head per day, according to one Dr. Roth, and about half a
whiff of tobacco—same authority). Once a year some of
the blacks get half a blanket, if they’re strong enough to
travel long distances for it. The “ wallaby-shooter ’’ con-
duces to a plentiful supply of game, and any nigger who
takes a bit of damper from a swaggie, or miner, or navvy,
is a glutton. Also, said s., m., and n. are liable to'a
heavy penalty for “ harboring blacks not under agree-
ment.” Heard of a settler and beche-de-mer man
on a northern river who adopted a deserted half-
caste of two, fed, clothed, and schooled her till
she was 16 and able to look after his home dur-
ing his compulsory absences, but returned re-
cently from a trip to find that his—almost—
daughter had been forcibly abducted by the police—act-
ing under orders—and taken to Bellenden Ker. Sick,
half-starved blacks are plentiful during the rainy weather.
I’ve seen young mothers with children at the breast
shivering in the wet and not allowed into empty houses,
because Mrs. Grundy was in power ; in swampy country,
no fires, sodden tea-tree bark mias, and hardly one johnny
to a dozen of ’em. The Chinaman’s opium is better and
more truly humane than such “ protection.” In one, out-
of-the-usual-road-district, I met a well-upholstered, clean,
healthy, copper-colored tribe who didn’t cadge—
because they’re myalls. I refrain from mentioning
place, fearing they may be .“protected.” Would
ask Dr. Roth if all the gins employed as domestics
in Cooktown (“White girls wanted as dom. servants in
N.Q. Apply Q.F. Em. Dept., London ”), and other towns
are signed on ? How many half-castes are in the B.K.
and Fraser Island stations against their wills ? Why are
said stations and others so strictly guarded from all
visitors not accredited by the Govt, clique? What
becomes of the wages received ? Who gets the registra-
tion fees ? Recognising the vast scope of the Protectors’
work, I specially admire their superhuman energy in
being able to devote so much time to lecturing in Bris-
bane and elsewhere.
“ Yerax ”: Re Dr. Roth’s reply (B. 12/4/’O2) to
“ Trotter’s ” remarks (B. 15/2/’O2) about the blacks in and
around Maytown. “ Trotter ”is not far wrong. If 51bs.
of flour per day for 67 persons is not starvation, I should
like to know what is. Further, I have seen the blacks
given beef only once in the last 12 months. Dr. Roth, in
any case, has not been near Maytown for four years, and,
until a few months ago, the Chinese did employ aborigi-
nals. Less “frill” and more rations, especially beef,
would make happier the fast-decaying aboriginal race
hereabouts. «
“ G.T.” : Dr. Roth (B. 12/4/’O2) does not know nearly
as much about the N.Q. blacks as he thinks. Many of
them are diseased ; ana, as for opium, they can get as
much as they want. Also, as to Chinamen and whites
living with gins : in the Tate district alone five white
men keep gins, and on one of the Tate gold-fields I have
often seen a white man, a gin and a blackfellow sleeping
together in a 6xB text. These things are well-known—
even to the police.
* • • •
•‘Caledonia” : How’s this for a White
Australia ? A man struck the dust-cursed town
of Thornborough, (N.Q.) t’other day, having
journeyed over 90 miles with a black gin as ugly
as mud. Wanted her “bound over” to him;
couldn’t get it done so said he’d marry her.
Meant to keep her somehow, as “ she’d cost him
about £2OO one way and another, particularly in
grog.” C. P. S. refused to perform ceremony.
Lothario philosophically remarked: “P’raps
lust as well—she might clear out and I would
have to pay maintenance for the whole tribe.”
There’s a splendid opening for a Matrimonial
Agency in some of the far Northern towns.
An old sol-
dier’s story:—
Do you remember
Jack Souter who was
No. 3 on No. 1 gun ?
Well, he was the man
who was knocked out
by a dead man’s fist.
It was at the time of
the Indian Mutiny
and the 27th, 28th,
and 29th Regiments
of Sepoys were
drawn up, guarded
on the right and
left wing by our
infantry and covered
by the gun 3, to see
one of their chiefs
hanged as an exam-
ple. The chief was
standing on a wag-
gon with the rope
round his neck, and
when the waggon
moved away there
was the poor beggar
dangling and kicking
in the air. A sepoy,
one of his caste,
groaneff aloud, and
the Brigade - Major
thundered oiff;:
“Seize that man!”
The man was brought
to No. 1 gun and
strapped to the muz-
zle. As soon as the
. . . , gun was fired his
head and chest flew in the air and dropped behind the
gun, the lower portion of his body sank on the ground
and one of the strapped arms, being released at thi socket
and held at the wrist by the rope, swunar back and
knocked Jack Souter as flat as a pancake.

Maoriland Tourist Department’s latest
planned excursion liesthrough the sceneof the great
86eruption when the Pink and White Terraces were
destroyed and sundry persons buried, and includes
a trip over Lake Rotomahana, part of which is
boiling. . Down south at Lake Manapouri a
steamer is to be imported at a cost of £33 000
delivered on the lake. There is already a steamer
on Lake I’e Anau. But, in view of recent West
Indian happenings it is unlikely that the public
will rush any trips over boiling lakes just now.

“Wealsman”: Concerning mirages. On
a limited scale one may be seen every day in Pitt-
st., Sydney. Stand just below Bathurst-st. where
the hill dips, and get Pitt-st. on a level with your
eye. Look towards the Quay, and ’bus-wheels
and pedestrians will appear to be plashing through
a foot of shimmering water. Mid-day is the best
time to catch the illusion, which the writer has
seen scores of times.
THE WAY BACK ANGELS.
IST. BUSHIE : “ Good-bye , Billy, old, man; I'm
afraid it's all up with me—l can hear the
angels sing in’.”
2ND. BUSHIE: “ Nonsense, old man, it’s only them
blessed muskeeters buzzin ’ round.”
“W.J.”: Looks as if most of the jeon-
tractors on a certain Vio. irrigation channel are
going to “fall in” over their undertakings.
Teams are pulling out daily, and returning to the
farm ; and, whereas one man had 35 scoops en-
gaged at the start, there are but eight on his
sections at present. As long as there was surface-
working the diminutive “ noddies ” figuring in
cookies’ “ teams ” were able to hold out, but the
deep cuttings accounted for them promptly. If
the drays and shovel-men have to be called in,
which some of the contractors don’t doubt will be
the case, the latter will be in a truly miserable
plight.

“ W.S.T.” ■writes :
Minister O’Sullivan recommends selectors to take up
land on the N.S.W. North Coast, and says there is room
for millions of people. Will he kindly say where there is
1000 acres of good land within 10 miles of a road or
navigable river that is available for selection. There is
good land, but much of it is locked up as forest reserves
—rightfully, I think—and what is open to the farmer at
present could only have the crops or produce taken away
Eer airship. Dense forest and deep gullies intervene
etween it and the ports.

“ Bob R.” : More “ long arpi.” At Xmas
time I was going to Sydney by cheap train, and
at a wayside station a doctor and a chemist got
in. They were very chummy, and apparently
bent on starting a joint business. The foI-
lowing Easter I was on a similar trip,
whenilthe same medico got in. “Hello!”
I said, “ where’s your friend the chem-
ist?” “Oh!” he answered, “the
infernal swine is on this train some-
where. Fact is, I’m going to Sydney
to get a chemist to run him out of ,
and he’s going for a doctor to do ditto
for me ! ”

“ 8.R.” : Wm. Rodier is again to
the fore with his theory of rabbit ex-
termination, which simply is to intro-
duce a “ polybuckrous ” state of affairs
amongst the bunnies. If N.S.W.
Govt, adopts this plan, a rabbit inspec-
tor’s billet will be no sinecure, seeing that
one of his duties must be to carefully ex-
amine the rabbits on a holding, to discover
if the owner is complying with the Depart-
mental regulations! I quite agree with
Mr. Rodier in condemning the use of poison
in all shapes and forms—it is a doubtful check, and
will never exterminate the pest—it will, however,
destroy all the birds, and who knows what that
means? Rabbits are going to build up a big
industry within a few years, and therein lies the
solution of the rabbit problem !
* * * *
“Billy”: One view of the matter not
considered bjf the Commissioners under the
N.S.W. Western Lands Act in their report is the
utter loss of confidence in the Western wilderness.
With hundreds of miles of sand-buried fences now
quite done for, la ge and expensive tank-excava-
tions full of silt end practically done for also,
enormous sums of money clean gone out of sight
for ever—literally under the dust —and a record
of eight years’ drought, would it be possible
to ever induce any people short of lunatics to risk
any fresh outlay there, even under greatly im-
proved conditions? The sun-dried specimens
of humanity who are still there don’t enter
into the argument, as long before anything can
be done for them they will have passed into that
land where drought, mortgagee co.’s, rabbits, and
scrub-cutting trouble not.

“Trotter”: Premier Philp talks of im-
porting 20,000 Germans from South Australia to
cut cane in Queensland. He need' not trouble.
This year the white man in Queensland will cut
all the cane, and Tommy Tanna can shift to his
island as quickly as possible. Hundreds of half-
starved, desperate men are making North; you
meet them along the coast track from Rockhamp-
ton in threes, fours, fives, and tens—strong, able-
bodied men; Australian men, not loafers; men
who are ready to cut a slice out of hell itself, let
alone sugar.

Although April had been torn
off the office calendar a coupl*

hot, with not a breath of air
stirring, and never the slightest
sign of the long looked-for rain.
The dust, dry and fine, as
only mallee dust can be, was
ankle deep, and squirted from
under foot like hot ashes. The
street drains threw up a stench
that could be felt. I could
almost see a phosphorescent
map of the town hanging in
the air over the real town, a
long row of stench representing
each street. Typhoid is so
common that it has come to be
regarded as being part of the
year’s duty to have it. The shops
all have big sign-boards, little lights,
and no stock to speak of. The
buildings (mostly wood) are parched

Maryborough (Vic.)is a most discontented
town, and is abusing its luck with much clamor.
The town succeeded in securing the finest pro-
vincial gaol in the state, a gaol that is tl)e pride
and ornament of the town, but now it can get no
one to put in it. The Bulletin suggests without
prejudice that the town council be given six
months without the option. This paper, doesn’t
know Maryborough council, but, calculating on
averages, it concludes that this wouldn’t,do any
special harm ; and it would give the gaol a show.

“ T.” : On the W.A. goldfields there are a
few aboriginals. One, said to be Queensland-
born, can sing a good song of the “coon ” variety,
plays his own accompaniments, and is a capital
step-dancer. He is also above the average as a
billiard player, and can “ screw in off the red ”
from “baulk ” oftener than not. Another affects
stump-oratory and writing letters to the news-
papers, and has a bank account. But he travels
with his tribe and takes part in an annual corro-
boree near Kalgoorlie. He is sweet with the
churches, and a biography of him was printed in a
goldfields religious paper not long ago.

nies got none. The grounds for refusing the poor
ficaninnies a blanket were a credit to humanity,

IT’S GRAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s grand to be a squatter
And sit upon a post,
And watch the little ewes and lambs
Giving up the ghost.
It’s grand to be a cockie,
With wife and kids to keep,
And find an all-wise Providence
Has mustered all your sheep.
It’s grand to be a Western man
With shovel in your hand,
To dig your little homestead out
From underneath the sand.
It’s grand to be a shearer
Along the Darling side,
And pluck the wool from stinking sheep
That recently have died.
It’s grand to be a rabbit
And breed till all is blue,
And then to die in heaps because
There’s nothing left to chew.
It’s grand to be a Minister
And travel like a swell,
And tell the Central Pastoralist3
To go to Inverell.
It’s grand to be O’Sullivan
And lead the bold array
That marches to prosperity
At seven bob a day.
It’s grand to be an unemployed
And lie in the Domain,
And wake up every second day
And go to sleep again.
It’s grand to borrow English tin
To pay for wharves and Rocks,
And then to find it isn’t in
The little money-box.
It’s grand to be a democrat
And toady to the mob
For fear that if you told the truth
They’d hunt you from your job.
It’s grand to be a lot of things
In this fair Southern land ;
But if the Lord would send the rain—
By Jove I that would be grand.

“ Dareel ” on a Wayfiack
police-trouble: —
Police authorities in the “ mirage sec-
tion" of Australia have had a weary
time during past 16 years dodging a
curse that has persistently dogged a
desolate police-station on one of the big
runs. A bush worker, winning £9OO in
one of “ Tatt.’s ’’ sweeps, started to see
city sights, and resolved to stay “ for
one night ”at an adjacent pub. He con-
tinued to stay, graduating from being
king in the parlor to being dead in an
outhouse, minus his winnings, and grate-
fully willing his horses and trap to the
hotel lady. The affair made a big row
at the time, and at next licensing court
the lady’s license was cancelled. But
she remained there, and the district
thirst was assuaged as usual. The dead
man’s ghost seemed to have got an edge
on the police, either for not interfering
earlier, or for harassing Mrs. Public-
house. The sub-inspector who opposed
the license died suddenly when next
visiting that station ; then, for years,
no trooper sent there on duty escaped
disaster. One, a noted athlete, was found
paralysed and speechless, dying from a
gunshot wound —an alleged suicide.
Another was violently sacked for con-
veying the enemy’s grog per Govern-
ment pack-horse, and joining in a wild
jamboree, whilst, for two days, a much-
hunted escapee rested at the police-
station, rationing his horses and reading
reports as to his supposed whereabouts.
One trooper kept the curse off well
enough to have the lady fined for sly-
grog selling, and hardly had the dis-
trict super, noted the victory than he
had to send his trooper south, a sunstric-
ken wreck. Then, after a long spell of
trouble, the force got a big haul of grog,
and next night the police-station caught
fire and was destroyed. Department
rebuilt it and stationed an extra man
there, and shortly scored another fine,
so heavy that the lady decided to “ do ”
the 12 months option. Returning to the
station one of the victors got badly
smashed in a coach accident. Finally
the department has shifted its station
some miles—“ to be nearer the telephone
office,” the supt. said —but the chances
are he w r onders whether the curse can
be dodged that way.

A Melb. Age correspondent
on a Western field: “ There are a
great many Scotchmen here.” And
lower down: “We are suffering an epidemic of
sandy blight.”
* * • •
J. D. Moore, an old chum, who in his day
has done some rough pioneering in Queensland,
writes thus re the Kenniffs :
Some 40 odd years ago I made one of a party of whites
and blacks—mostly native police or commissioned
butchers—that went in pursuit of the niggers who
slaughtered the Wills family at Cullinaringo station, in
what is known as Springsure district. In the pursuit
none of the party asked, when some myalls were over-
taken, whether or not they had a hand in the butchery
business. Their color was deemed a sufficient passport.
No matter what the age or sex was, they were tried by
Jedburgh justice and put out of the way to prevent them
going astray in the future. On the occasion mentioned,
the blacks took to the broken scrubby country lying
between Cullinaringo, the Meteor and Nagoa, where they
were followed. Across the Springsure Downs, in a
westerly direction from the Wills station, stands a high,
flat-topped group of mountains, named by explorer
Mitchell the Buckland Tableland. From that group a
series of ranges radiate, and there several streams
have their sources, the Meteor River among the
number. The Mitchell Range, a spur from the
main chain, stretches from the head of the Nagoa to the
Buckland. The country intervening is covered with
dense scrubs of brigalow, black oak and gidyah, filled in
with prickly shrubs, inhabited by dingoes, snakes,
boomers, scrub turkeys (plenty of eggs in the season),
blackfellows, and wallabies. Over the eastern side of the
Springsure, towards the Dawson, the country is much
the same—to the north scrubs, spinifex, and ranges ;to
the south, ditto, bar the spinifex. The blacks about
Springsure were bad from the jump. It was some of the
Dawson tribe that slaughtered the Fraser family at Hor-
net Bank, and the Nagoa tribe, a bloodthirsty lot, joined
them. The combination made the district Sheol. To keep
them a bit within bounds a detachment of native police,
under George Murray, was posted at Springsure; another
on Wealwandanjee adjoining Cullinaringo, under J. B.
Nutting. They dealt out stoush wholesale, and, as the
officers in charge reported, “ dispersed ” them. When
they dispersed a native in those days he wasn’t reunited
till the Day of Judgment. Somewhere about the time
the Wills family camped, John and William Kelman,
natives of the Hunter, at Branxton, took up
Meteor Downs. They, or one of the banks, sold
to James Tyson. Between them and the Wills’ station
Bqchajnan took up country for the Scottish Squatting
, and Investment Co. Next was Springsure Downs,
' taken- up by Busby of Cassillis. W. and Charlie
Thomson sat down at Orion Downs, adjoining
Meteor Downs; Richards at Springwood, where the
township now stands. Lower down the Meteor one
Paton, named by the nigs. “Cobborn Debbil Debbil,”
squatted ;he was a terror with the carbine. Surrounding
the stations indicated the country is rough and scrubby
in all directions for many miles. On the north-western
boundary of Meteor Downs the Buckland tableland is
deeply indented with gorges, something like those of the
Cox and Grose valleys in the Blue Mountains, strewn with
boulders varying from the size of a church to a hansom
cab, with precipitous sides full of caves. Just here is a
bit of information gratis to the Queensland Govt. A
seam of coal lies underground at the base of the table-
land. Taken for granted that the Kenniffs are good
bushmen and have travelled the surrounding country,
following their occupation as shearers, they can get away
from the Meteor in any direction wit hout once showing in
the open. As for their making for Bunya Bunya moun-
tains, the man who offered that suggestion knows about as
much of the lay of the country as a wombat does of Pitt-
street. To make further west to the Barcoo, Alice,
Rodney and Thomson they have only to stick to the
Mitchell Range. At Mitchell Gap, head of the Barcoo,
by turning to the north, they get into broken spinifex
country that will lead them to Port Denison or Port
Mackay, or, by continuing north, to Townsville or
Charters Towers; or by taking the Coxon Range they
would come to the head of the Flinders. Following that
they would reach Hell’s Gates, and, further on, the
“ Dead Finish,” where they could remain in perfect
safety for the term of their natural lives. If they wanted
a shift they could make further west to the Diamantina,
from there to the Roper, and camp with the buffalo
hunters —mostly “ wanteds.” They could make south-
east, still keeping strictly to the mountains, to Roma,
Donnybook, St. George, or Brewarrina ; or, on the ranges
all the time, to the Nive, Maranoa, or Warrego, and from

thence to—well, blazes. They are perfectly safe on any of
the back-blocks. A bobby out that way is no account.
He has to keep a civil tongue in his head or
gets a knock if too inquisitive. In all my experience I
never met a constable worth a tinker’s anathema as a
bushman. Take one of them off the road and turn him
round twice and he would not know where ’e are. Like
the Gardiner gang, the Kellys, Thunderbolt, Morgan and
the Governors, the Kenniffs should provide good times,
extra pay and picnics for the police force for some time to
come. The police shine where there are plenty of tips
given by publicans, Chows, fences and flossies —not in
pursuit of the bush offender.
In Memoriam.
BRET HARTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cometh the summons, and the man obeys—
To him a long farewell—
Who told the story of the Roaring Days,
And told it well.
A sorrow sighing through the Western pines ;
A long-drawn sob of grief ;
Fate’s finger trembles on the page it signs,
And turns the leaf.
Yet why be sad ? His pictures rise in throngs,
Up through the mists of years,—
Sweet, living pictures, singing hearty songs
Of pioneers;—
Those reckless rovers of the Outer Fringe
Who blazed the Nation’s track,
Whose stubborn arms made stubborn forests cringe
And hurled them back ;
Of these he wrote and sang; a nobler task
Falls to the lot of few ;
A nobler, truer artist none might ask,
Because — he knew.
He knew and felt, and etched with master hand
His pictures grave and gay,
Within the great heart of his native land
To live for aye.
And now he sleeps; his toil is o’er, and rest
In honored grave is sweet;
His camp is pitched within that further West
Where all friends meet.
Here in the other Land of Pioneers
We pledge his land anew,
Our bond of kinship stronger for its tears—
We loved him, too.
Our she-oaks listening by the long lagoon
Catch the Pacific’s hymn,
And, with the swaying gum-trees, seem to croon
A requiem!
His country, greeting ! Kin with us for aye,
On his grave spare us room,
Among the teeming tributes, for a spray
Of wattle-bloom.
He told the stories of the Roaring Days,
And told, them passing well;
Cometh the summons, and the man obeys —
And so—Farewell /

You are the two thousandth-odd person who has asked
that question. A person who can’t see a simple thing
like that shouldn’t have a vote... .A. : You say “if Gov.-
Gen. Hopetoun had got the proposed extra £BOOO a year

your characters are or what happened to them....
K.P.W. : Kahler’s picture of “ Australian Society at Mel-
bourne Gup ” was a purely commercial fake : if you paid
so many guineas you could get your portrait, or that of
your best girl, into it, and the more guineas you paid the
better the position your portrait got in the picture. That
sort of enterprise is not altogether unknown even in these
days R.S. : Some good work spoilt by blotches, such
as cormorants “shivering” and “the wary frog and
mussel.” Not for the most pressing metrical reasons can a
cormorant shiver or a mussel be wary in these columns
The Other Fellow : Intentions much better than verses
.. ..R. J.B. (Armadale) : You enclose no newspaper cutting
by way of verification, and we fail to find the item in the
news reports... .Reader : You send your own bald asser-
tion to which you are not game to even append your
name and address, and say that you will wait to see if
The Bulletin is sufficiently “fair-minded ” to publish it as
a fact. As regards this paper’s readiness to believe “ some
hysterical female’s” statements about the concentra-
tion camps, when these were backed by a child mortality
officially given at the rate of between 400 and 500
per 1000 annually (and it once reached as high as that)
the hysterical female has good evidence behind her
O.VV. : Slave rates paid to some B.H. mine-contrac-
tors noted ; the rest would take too much trimmigg. For
instance, you say the B.H. Prop. “ used to be a silver
mine but is now practically a lead mine. Well, last half-
year the silver was still worth £295,000 of the total of
£650,000 realised Mine Manager: So stated in the
annual report of the goldfields Chamber of Mines
Peroo : Aren’t taking any words of wisdom written by
boys of 13 years. Send' them to the Sydney weekly
which cherishes the productions of servant-girls and
bladder-headed babies Cary-street, L. : No signature
to your letter. Also, we get so much matter that it is
impracticable, save in urgent cases, to give prompt
replies.. ..W.R.W. : No sentences on the deserters yet;
Australian military law is in a chaotic state just now,
and it is questionable if any legal military tribunal can
be set up, pending Federal legislation J.G.D. : Again
—don’t swallow whole the Ketchener version of the Buc-
caneers ; it is mighty convenient to shift on to the Man
who is Dead all the awkward things that call for ex-
planation Lerli: Apparent moral —The girl who objects
to her dad getting drunk is liable to be a faithless wife...
S.H. : It was all in the papers at the time A.M.D. :
Those aren’t Bulletin sentiments. Send your verses to
some Jingo paper Country Greed : We’ve called atten-
tion to illiberal University franchise conditions before....
H.P. : What the girl did was simply what any girl would
do in the circumstances.... C. A. B.: “Kenny” is ill-done
and over-done Cherub: Smartness strained R. W.P.:
Pretty good idea —inadequately worked out E.F.N. :
“ Sarah ” smart, but too flimsy.... .L.M.D. : Well-versed,
but too common-place of sentiment Nemesis : Good
idea, dressed in hopelessly bad verse Ironbark : Pretty,
but rather feeble.. ..F.F.T.: Verse flops around too much.
....D.R.E.: Foolish little'varn R.8.D.: Would gladly
owe twopence to know what the mystery is all about.
A.D.L. : Plain and ordinary Pookey : Of course it was
a lie—that the wheels of a waggon carrying four tons
passed over a hedgehog without damaging the spiky one !
The ’hog might have been down a hole when the waggon
passed over him. Writer’s father has seen scores killed
by blacks with one blow of a waddy P.W. : There are
some extinct volcanoes in Australia—-among them Mounts

they may patronise the “ city of statues,” with its fine

duce a draught to carry the smoke away ? Hot air moves
upwards, not downwards. A flue with a downward
tendency simply wouldn’t “draw.’....A.8.: Impres-
sions ” not bad, but that sort of thing needs to be very
well done indeed E.G.H.: Not up to mark Izelle :
Trite Glenara : Good subjects, but verses too rough.
... .8. Ten. : But The B. has to be more careful than an
ordinary publishing-firm; what would be eccentricity
in others would be crime in us. That’s the penalty of not

Tram co. ran a Id. section, and ljd. and 2d. tickets cn
some lines, for years previous to the starting of the ’bus
opposition, which is a very limited opposition, anyhow—
W.A.8.: On principle, we don’t care to “ butter up ” our
own people in our own columns ; let the paper speak
for itself Sigma: We don’t actually hanker after
“ birthstains ” poetry Rex : Bulletin rarely reprints

GIRLS AS “ OUR BOYS.”
TO TUB EDITOR.
Sir.—Can you inform me why they do not send girls as
soldiers? I have a daughter who is very anxious to en-
list, if there is the shadow of a chance. She does not
want to go as a teacher, as she dislikes children. She is
a good shot, and looks well in her brother’s uniform, and
I am sure she would give every satisfaction at the front. —
I am, May.

of her daughter’s accomplishments is correct, she
has specified the place where her daughter might
possibly give every satisfaction.

The blame does not rest on the N.S.W. Forestry Depart-
ment, fpr there is none—only a branch of the Lands
Department, which deals not in any way with the land
upon which timber grows, but merely with the cutting
and removal under licenses of the timber on Crown lands.
As far as administering the land with a view to conserva-
tion of timber is concerned it has no jurisdiction, the
conditions under which land is leased for settlement, or
under which permissions to ringbai k timber are issued,
being under the jurisdiction of the local land boards. Mr.
Bennett is now, under the authority of the See Govern-
ment, endeavoring to place the administration of Forestry
on a basis that will vest in the department all control of
dealings with the timbered lands of the State, and it is
proposed during the coming session of Parliament to
introduce a Forest Bill for the regulation of these matters,
and for,the appropriation for forestry of the
valuably-timbered lands of the State.

WHAT PIERPONT MORGANISM IS COMING
TO—“ How MUCH FOR THE LOT 1 ”
THE SOCIAL GIMLET IN THE PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY
Dr. Harper thought it probable that the Lord did not favor divorce
at all. The whole basis of marriage rested on the one original, natural tact,
that the persons married became one flesh, and what God had joined let no
man put asunder. He could not conceive how a Christian Church could
accept persons not prepared to live up to Christ’s standard. The cause of
social purity was doomed if the church did not take the lead in this matter.

PURVEYORS BY SPECIAL APPOINTMENT TO HIS MAJESTY THE KIN®.
My Melbourne correspondent continues :— 1
“ A youthful Senator was guilty of a social
lapse at the Sargoods’ shivoo. He was contem-
plating the brown foreigners, thoughtfully, when
bis hostess happened along. ‘Looking at the
Japs?’ she queried. He said ‘Yes; these are
the fellows we are striving so hard, in my part of
the country, to keep out of Australia.’ Madame’s
face sharpened suddenly: ‘ I have never had
such easy guests .to entertain,’ she said for
answer. Then the Senator bethought himself, and
did a side-stroke out of the sea of politics and
perilous sentiments. The Sargoods are evidently
aiming for a big Commonwealth trophy. And
they deserve it, if only for the wear and tear their
house and lawn and gardens, and patience,
undergo in the cause of lavish hospitality. The
mistress of Rippon Lea is a person of individuality
and decision of character. She has the temerity
to do what no other hostess attempts, and that is
to print on the programme a conspicuous request
that guests will refrain from talking during a
musical number. Of course, they don’t. Many
don’t read it. Those whfe do, laugh. The hostess
stands by with a grim countenance —the only
silent listener.
“The ‘smart’ world flocks in large crowds to
both our leading hostelries. One sees as many
Melb. folk therein, almost, as visitors, for Melb.’s
moneyed people nowadays are given to shunting
house-keeping worries, selling off their sticks, and
putting up, for a long or short time, at a swell pub.
The merely fashionable and frivolous mostly
flock to Menzies’, while the Grand, at the other
end of the penny section, is the home of political
and theatrical stars and others, who are in
society with a purpose. At lunch time the grand
dining-room looks like the precincts of the
Federal House. Here are the Forrests, Downers,
Kingstons, Braddons, and other magnates.
The Reps,’ womenkind are much given to the
handy blouse-skirt, with long coat, easy to don
for outdoor rig, and justmow fancy flannel is the
only wear for blouses. The men’s togs are more
hard-worked. The Forrest tweeds grow baggier
daily, but stout men do wear out their clothes.
Also our only Bart, shows up at times in pants
quite threadbare about the hems.
“Yankee Missioner Geil makes no pretence,
even, that the religion he preaches makes him
sympathetic or courteous. A lady asked wag she
to blame for playing cards to keep her husband
at home ? Geil’s answer meant a lot to her, poor
thing, so it wasn’t very kind of him to advise her
‘ next time she got married, not to choose an in-
tellectual blank.’ What sort of an intellectual
blank, anyhow, does Mrs. Geil have —if there is a
Mrs. Geil ? In one suburb, same missioner yarded
in 21 school girls as converts. He’d just remarked
with a sob in his voice * I can do no more,’ mean-
ing that his convert-catching tactics were done
pro tem. The 21 soft ’uns felt so sorry to see ‘ poor
Mr. Geil nearly crying,’ that they made for the
penitent form en masse. Soon as the college boys
present saw what the girls were about, 21 of them
i followed suit.”
“The lace-working craze has got such a hold in
Melb. that it is quite usual to see women, directly
they enter tram or train, haul a little heap of
material from a basket and commence looping it
together as though their lives depended on the
thing. In the shaky cars this must mean havoc
for the eyes, but, so long as the Fashion’s on, the
average woman doesn’t care a straw for conse-
quences. It isn’t so long since the sex would have
considered it the height of vulgarity for anyone
to occupy tram tedium in this temporarily pro-
fitable way.
“A romance just ended dates, for its beginning,
back about 15 years. At that time a girl had a
young lover in a gallant sailor boy who loved and
sailed away. Now, the romance is that after all
these years the divided pair met again suddenly
and unknowingly, and, the lady being endowed
with an income and good temper, or rather a for-
giving spirit, consented to wedlock.
“Conspicuous in a recent theatre audience was
a Toorak heiress, who showed her newly-darkened
locks in their latest form of coiffing—a mighty roll-
back with a firmly-twisted figure snuggling in the
hollow of the neck. The intense black hue has
been adopted because the soil-brown color has
been vetoed by a skilful costumier. It is so much
easier to dress up effectively to a black thatch,
while the wave-swell of inky tresses, from a dist-
ance in theatre or ball-room, strikes the eye in-
stantly.
“Mrs. Maesmore Morris, who takes beauty-
prizes, seems to have sprung into London fame
since the new year. Many recent journals of the
Big Smoke give full-page portraits of the Mel-
bourne beauty actress. The latest gossip retells of
a present of game from a Royal admirer. Extrava-
gant rumors are rife of the great style she affects,
and the reputation, even among the dressy divini-
ties of Stage-land, of Mrs. Morris. All pictures
portray the aesthetic pose ever favored of the
languid beauty. Her eyes look dreamily out to
you. Flowers droop at the waist and fill her long
lazy hands. The figure appears unchanged, the
form still slender. An absence of effort, they say,
is a pleasant feature of her acting. Her voice,
always sweet, has grown stronger; it is now
reckoned one of her most charming possessions.
“A silvery tenor of a foreign land had to secure
the help of an interpreter to translate into his
own tongue the love-letters of Melbourne girls.
They arrived at his hotel and the theatre from
which he gravitated in shoals, and by this time
the Lothario who has had greatness and love
thrust upon him in this land, can conjugate the
whole of the verb ‘to lofe ’in English. A watch-
ful wife and the interpolations of an interpreter
have, so far, it is understood, kept the fat tenor
unscathed from the hands of Melbourne’s foolish
virgins.
‘ ‘ Talking of foolish virgins. There are some—
though not many—who cut wisdom-teeth late in
life. There has just been an instance of this
truth. A Victorian lady, of advanced years and
a large fortune, recently plighted her troth to a
clever young man of the lancet profession. Con-
gratulations poured in—and only then did the
elderly fiancee begin to consider the situation.
Her meditations bore fruit. The lady reckoned
up her fortune and the bridegroom-elect’s years—
and perhaps his hopes. Then she summarily
broke off the engagement and feels like living
happily ever after.
“One of the tallest Phyllises of the Melbourne
tea-rooms is the promised matrimonial partner of
a very diminutive bachelor. It is always the little
suitors who slip in under one’s elbow and carry off
the prizes. The benedict-elect of the present
instance is about half the beauty's height, but the
friends of both say a thumping big heart makes
up for a brief body.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Twenty of the 42 new Members of the S.A.
Assembly polled less than half of the votes cast.
Speaker Coles topped the list with 66 per cent,
lhe only Minister who got a majority was
ireasurer Butler, 58 per cent. The Jenkins’
figure was 49.
More than one Federal member is in
serious straits owing to the inadequacy of the
salary allowed—£4oo a year.' Just now—with
Kyabram yelling in the distance and Hopetoun’s
allowances causing much trouble—the movement
for an increase is “ off.”
Adelaide Register crows over the result
of the S. A. elections, but, as a matter of fact, the
new Assembly, consisting of 42 members, contains
22 professing Liberals, five Laborites, and only 15
Tories, all of whom are not willing to acknow-
ledge the National Ass. as their mother.
The dismissal (under the guise of retrench-
ment) of certain prominent officials of Q. Mines
Dept., is equal to anything yet perpetrated by
the Boodlewraith. Considering the Tartana
rumpus last year, knowledge sometimes spells
d ismissal, unless the right ear is whispered into.
Averred in the Federal lobbies that ruc-
tions have occurred in the caucus meetings of the
Senate re venue-tariffists. Josiah Symon, so the
story goes, aspires to absolute dictatorship, and
his superior air offends N.S.W. Senators, two of
whom have declined to attend any more meetings
of the party. *
THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.
A New Guinea Missionary writes “ When I first came to the island I turned the scale at
I[?]st., but now, owing to the athletic exercises we indulge in here, I have reduced myself a good
deal in weight.
In the S.'A. elections the Opposition—
which forms the most resolute Tory element in
the Assembly—lost its secretary, poet Caldwell;
its whip, Col. Castine—the hero of the nine-hours’
stonewalling ■ speech against the granting of a
trades hall site 10 years ago ;* and its ex-leader,
Copley, a perverted Liberal. All three first
entered the Legislature in ’B4.
Premier Peacock might have expected it:
the Melb. dailies, now his deadly enemies, have
started to jibe at him for his paltering and weak-
ness in connection with the Tocsin “sedition.” He
is accused of not having shown the courage of his
own opinions. This is the reward of the truckler.
The boots you lick will inevitably kick you sooner
or later.
Canadian Premier Laurier states defi-
nitely that he is against any proposals to drag
Canada “into the vortex of that militarism which
is now the blight and curse of Europe.” Another
set-back to Chamberlainism ! It seems as
though Seddon will be alone in his gory at the Im-
perial Conference.
If the nigger-employing pearl-fishery
monopolists of N. Queensland carry out their
threat to settle at Merouke and become Dutch
subjects, they may get a bad shock on their
next visit to Australia to find themselves shut
out under the Aliens Restriction law for not
being able to write 50 words in a European
language—say Polish.
Melb. Argus abuses Minister Kingston
and accuses him of espionage for visiting the
Custom House, demanding to see the duty-books,
and insisting on employees commencing work at
the specified time, and working up to hours. The
Argus is the paper that shrieks loudest for econo-
mical reform in departments. It howls with the
reformers and-screams with the reformed. The
Argus is one of many papers that know what
they want and always object to getting it.
Secldon’s Maori war-whoop had hardly
died away, and the old dead democrat with his
10th (or is it 20th ?) cohentingent was still almost
within co-ee, when his usually faithful henchman,
Ward, declared at a festive gathering of Otago
Scots that he was opposed to a colonial standing
army and deprecated the spread of militarism.
Apparently, Ward, having got his bauble, wants
to show before election time that he is a democrat
still.
It seems curious that Alfred Deakin, who
never attained top place in a State Cabinet and
who never achieved any really great success in
politics, should be made Acting-Premier in
Barton’s absence. Deakin is a scholarly man of
the classical variety, an eloquent speaker, and he
has no enemies, but he isn’t one of the strong men
who Do Things. The impression gains ground
that Premier Barton dislikes strong men who Do
Things.
S.M. Herald, commenting on N.S.W.’s
foreign trade, says (12/5/’02): “But for the first
effects of the minimum-wage policy, and the
higher duties of the Eederal tariff, no doubt the
export of domestic produce would have been even
greater than it was. ” The export of the State’s
own produce in 1901 was the largest on record,
save that of 1891 (when also a Protective tariff had
just come into force). And instead of seeing in
this boom a proof of the blessings and advantages
of the new tariff and the “ minimum-wage policy,”
the S.M. Herald gives us its unsupported assur-
ance that but for these things the best record for
ten years would have been better still. What is
the exact value of the Herald’s unsupported
assurance ?
Seddon s latest and most terrible bang on
the Jingo drum before quitting Maoriland:—
Mr. Seddon urged the men to observe strict discipline
and obedience, without which there would be short-
coming in duty. What he wanted was to see that when
the war was over, our colony came out on top. He
referred to the letter written by him to Lord Roberts in
1901), recommending the use of blockhouses, and it was
pleasing to know that the advocacy of such a system sug-
gested from this colony had been adopted.
The present writer had a lot more to do with the
success of the war than Seddon had. In 1899 he
wrote to Chamberlain urging that the British
army should take food and weapons with it, and
Chamberlain was so struck with the idea that he
adopted it at once. A great deal-of the British
success wag due to this far-seeing suggestion.
The elections will make no difference in
the officials of S.A. Parliament. Lawyer-squatter
Stirling will again be President of the Council.
Ex-auctioneer Jenkin Coles will be Speaker, and
retired-storekeeper Catt will be Chairman of the
Assembly. The President and Speaker each draw
£4OO a year, and the Chairman £2OO, in addition
to the £2OO received by each as M.P.
Freetrader S. Smith told the Senate
in lugubrious tones that in the United
States 9 per cent, of the people owned
71 per cent, of the wealth, which was,
as usual, one of the evil consequences
of Protection, and showed, &c. Mul-
hall, the English statistician
(“ Industries and Wealth of
Nations,” page 100), reckons
that in jTreetrade Britain 1|
per cent, of the adult popu-
lation, which is less than 1
per cent, of the whole popu-
lation, owns 80 per cent, of
the wealth, which is about
ten times worse; but in the
bright lexicon of Smith that
fact isn’t entered. Senator
Dryasdust Pulsford, a lost
figure tottering over a shift-
ing Sahara of statistics,
asked the Senate, on tihe
second day of his great
speech, to look at and
marvel upon the wonderful
fact that Freetrade Britain,
with 5 per cent, of the
world’s population, produced
20 per cent, of the world’s
manufactures. It has really
about three per cent, of the
population, and produces
about twelve per cent, of the
manufactures still, the
figures were reasonably ac-
curate for Pulsford. The really surprising affair,
however, is that Pulsford doesn’t seem in the least
degree affected by the spectacle of the United
States, with 5 per cent, of the world’s population,
turning out about 30 per cent, of the world’s
manufactures. That is a much larger shock than
the other.
The anomaly is seen of Senator Symon,
representing a State (S.A.) in which Freetrade
has been dead for years before the Federal elec-
tions, leading the Foreign-trade assault on the
tariff in the Senate. Kingston battled hard for
Symon during the Federal election contest, and
his position at the top of the poll had absolutely
no connection with his fiscal views. The National
League ostentatiously threw Symon over, too, be-
cause he had helped Kingston so vigorously at a
previous provincial contest.
A statement made by J. A. Heath, an
ex-trooper of the Bushveldt Carbineers, to the
Melbourne Argus (6th inst.) gives facts as to the
shooting of Boer prisoners before Morant reached
the Spelonken district. This was when the de-
tachment was under the orders of the “un-named
officer”—Ketehener’s confidant. The very im-
portant statement of Heath has found no place,
as yet, in the Sydney dailies.
Federal P.M.G. Drake is having a lively
time. Melb. papers are howling for universal
penny postage (which will cost £BO,OOO a year) in
one breath and “ economy ”in the next. Sydney
papers cry out against postage on newspapers.
The Federal Parliament sacrificed a big slice of
revenue by knocking out “Tattersall;” has enacted
a minimum-wage clause that will cost £40,000 a
year, and an anti-colored-labor contract clause
which will cost anything up to £50,000 a year ;
and it did all these things without even a hint as
to where the money they cost was to come from.
Australian Star (Premier See’s paper)
on March 2, pleading for a coalition, says :
Last year the State Premier made advances which were
rejected without any particularly sane explanation, and
now, if there are a sufficient number who have arrived at
a just appreciation of the position, it is their turn to
make an overture.
John See is said to be very anxious to “dish ” the
Labor party and to get rid of a few colleagues,
both of which objects a coalition would serve.
Westralian Freetrader Matheson, in the
Senate, when backing up Symon who wants a
“low tariff to encourage imports,” said that the
tariff is prohibitive; therefore destructive to
revenue. In the next breath he wanted to know:
“ On what grounds the tariff was characterised as
a compromise ? The tariff gave more revenue than
was asked for by £400,000.”—(S. M. Herald,
5/10/’O2 ) The Foreign-trade party has fallen over
this snag so often that it should recognise it by
now.
Does Kingston know that the resolution
(adopted at his suggestion by the Federal House)
to “admit all M.L. pine undressed free,” may be
construed to apply to all Maoriland timber.
Mafcai, rimu, kauri and kahikatea are all known
as pines, and totara, though not called a pine,
belongs with the others to the conifer®. In other-
words, all the building-timbers, as well as the
butter-box timber of M.L., are pines of one kind
or another.
Senator Gould, of N.S.W. (S.M. Herald
report):—
It was remarkable that in two States in which a
Protective policy had been adopted there had been a
diminution of population.
Will Mr. Gould give the names of these Protective
States whose population has diminished ? There
are certainly no such States in this part of the
world. Possibly the silly little man is thinking
of Ireland, which has lost half its population since
Freetrade set in there.
A DIFFICULT FEAT.
THE CHEMIST: "Two tablespoonfuls
every four hours, and put your
feet in hot water and mustard
before you go to bed”
The Adelaide Labor members now wail
over the departure of Kingston from local politics,
for they look in vain for a strong Liberal leader.
Yet when he was in Adelaide they were always
attacking him. Once they almost decided to run-
a.man against him in his own constituency, and it
was only because two Labor members ratted on
the Kingston Govt, that it was thrown out of
office in Dec. ’99. Had he been retained in power
he had pledged himself to stop in the State Parlia-
ment till Household Suffrage for the Council was
passed.
The points on which the Foreign-trade
gang in the Federal Parliament is quite solid are
that the tariff is prohibitive, and, therefore,
destructive of revenue ; that it will produce about
£9,500,000, which is a lot more revenue than is
wanted, and amounts to grievous extortion ; and
that if the duties were reduced, as they ought to
be, the great influx of imports (when we can’t pay
for the imports we have already) would cause
them to yield more revenue, and make the extor-
tion still worse.
N.S. W. Lands Minister Crick sees need
for but one amendment of his Western Land Act
—provision to allow the State to pay a squatter
for an improvement wanted by a selector, the
selector repaying the State by instalments. But
it’s early to talk until the land sharks get to work.
For instance, there is no provision making resi-
dence a compulsory condition of a homestead lease
or other selection ; and if without such a condition
the Commissioners can prevent wholesale dummy-
ing they will be worth all their salary.
Premier Peacock, when he presented his
last financial statement, announced that he
expected Victoria to end the year with a deficit,
but l.e didn’t mean to do anything special—just
let things slide. At Clunes, t’other day, he said
he expected the deficit by the end of June to pan
out at about £229,000, but still he wasn’t doing
anything extra to meet the case—just letting
things slide. Unless some special good fortune
comes he anticipates a shortage next year also,
but he means to let that slide too. In Queens-
land, South Australia and Tasmania large deficits
are also expected, and they are all being let slide.
Something will have to be done with this sliding
paralysis. *
The first act of the Senate in the Tariff
debate was to recommend a large reduction of the
duty on foreign beer on the ground that the
reduction would lead to so much more beer being
imported that the low duty would produce more
revenue than the high one. It didn’t profess that
more beer would be drunk—simply that people
would use less local beer and more foreign, and
some local brewers would suffer, and their em-
ployees be, thrown out of work. The insensate
hatred of non-producers like Neild and Pulsford
for anything in the shape of an Australian
industr}' is like the remarks the devil made when
he saw the bucket of holy water.
Not only is Premier Barton’s word not as
his bond, but even his explicit statement on easily-
verified matters of fact, seems of little account.
On April 22, Barton told Labor leader Watson
that “the Government would be responsible for
any promises it made to the House. Less than 20
permits for the admission of Chinese, for the
whole Commonwealth, were then outstanding.”
(Age report.) Since then, at Melbourne alone , 25
Chinese have been landed on exemption permits,
viz. : By the Kumaru (30th April), 4 ; the Ching-
tu (6th May), 12: and the Airlie (9th May), 9.
Probably the arrivals to other ports equal, at
least, as many. What has acting-Premier Deakin
to say of his chief’s word ?
Editor Bulletin. —N.S.W. seems to be
passing through a serious crisis, what with
drought, plague, unemployed, debt, and stagna-
tion. Political and sacerdotal methods having
failed to give relief, I propose that the following
gentlemen form themselves into a scientific,
philanthropic, and philosophic oligarchy and set
things right: Messrs. John Dwyer, Larry Foley,
Harry Foran, George Perry, S. A. Rosa, John
Norton, Brother G. E. Ardill, J. Randall Carey,
David Walker, R. D. Meagher, Tremayne Dun-
stan, T. M. Slattery, German Charlie, Quong
Tart, and the editor Sunday Times. I reckon
they would about fix things.—-Yours, &e., W.J.S.

The After-Effects of
Rheumatic Fever.
To Mr. W. WEBBER, Proprietor of
VITADATIO
AND
Indian Oil of Cream.
Dear Sir,—lt is with profound gratitude that I feel it
my duty to inform you of the great good derived by the
use of your VITADATIO and OIL OF CREAM.
To begin with, let me say my trouble was what doctors
called paralysis of the legs, and especially the knees,
which left me quite powerless to walk ; this I must also
say was the after-effects of Rheumatic Fever. For
upwards of six months I was in a deplorable condition—
two months of this time I was in the Launceston Hospital,
and about four months with Mr. J. Irvine, Glenfield House,
Brisbane-street, Launceston. The doctors finding they
were unable to cure me, said I would never again have
the normal use of my affected limbs. ... I had often
heard of your VITADATIO and INDIAN OIL OF CREAM,
but had no faith in it as a remedy for my disease.
However, I was urged to give it a fair trial, and consented
to do so. Seven bottes of INDIAN OIL OF CREAM were
rubbed faithfully intomy limbs and spine, and five bottles
(large size) of your VITADATIO taken internally with
the result that I now have once again the full use of my
limbs, and thank God I ever heard of you and your great
remedies.
Yours truly,
August, 1896 FRANK TIBBETTS.

to the Wide World
THERE ARE MANY REASONS why we pose before the public of Australasia as the Leading?
® Pathologists and Medical Experts of the Day. One of them is because we do more
practical good and create more permanent physical benefit than any other association of
medical men in Australasia. We are not bound down by any specified rule, our views and our
principles are as wide as the Continent over whioh we practice. Our systems, methods,
practices are new; there is no room for obsoletism in an Institution whose patients are
as the sands upon the sea-shore.
EMINENT PHYSIOLOGISTS from the World’s scientific laboratories admit Electricity is the
source of Life. It is the creative and sustaining: element in all animated things. Our new
methods prove that Electricity can be applied judiciously, but to be effectual the system
must be prepared by a course of special renovative medicines. Then a great and remarkable change
occurs. The worn-out, physically enfeebled system becomes strong in strength, palsied
reproductive systems become obedient to the powers of volition and sensation, functional
disordersare remedied, the nerves strengthened, the circulation equalised, and Health
is assured.
Remarkable Results from
Remarkable Persons.
WE CAN OFFER PROOFS that will convince everyone
that our new systems of ELECTROPATHY, orthe judicious
use of Electricity and Medicine, will cure certain classes of
disease which the medical faculty has signally failed to relieve.
Facts are stubborn thing's. Men like Mr. Joseph Megson,
Champion Cyclist of N.S. Wales; Mr. J. Johns, Champion
Light-weight Pugilist of Australia ; Mr. Rd. Cavill, Champion
Swi nmer of Australia, and holder of many World’s Records,
together with many other well-known professionals in the spheres
of Sport, Art, and Music, would not say the ELECTRO-
MEDICAL TREATMENT did them incalculable good if it did not.
But we have given them “ nerve power and strength, of which
they have despiired.” The copies of their original Testi-
monials will be posted to any person for perusal. The
Specialists of the FREEMAN and WALLACE Institute assures
anyone of long suffering that they will ensure a new physical
change in them by a few weeks adoption of their new treatment.
Specialities.
Diseases which will yield readily to the Electro-Medical treat-
ment are Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Sciatica, Nervous Heart
Troubles, Epileptic Affections, Lumbago and Rheumatism,
If you suffer from any of these try an “ Invigorator ” with our
medicines. You will be cured.
Don’t Miss this Medical Work.
Everyone in New South Wales who have sent One Shilling; in
Stamps to the Specialists for their new work, “Clinical Experi-
ences,” are surprised at its usefulness. It is worth a pound a
page to persons living in the far country parts. It contains 550
pages of medical literature, 150 full and half-page medical illustra-
tions, and contains 31 chapters on various diseases, epidemics,
their growths and treatment. Love and Marriage, Fevers,
Plague, Sunstroke, Burns and Scalds, Insomnia, Piles, Dropsy,
Asthma, Diabetes, Snakebite and Oure, Fractures, Broken Limbs,
Wounds, etc., etc., are treated exhaustively. One Shilling in
stamps posts it free to any address. Its literature is clear, concise
and useful, its illustrations graphic and entertaining.

Champion Testimonials from
Three Champions.
We want all the people of the Commonwealth to read these
grand testimonials from men magnificent of record in Australian
Sporting Spheres.
Mr. J. MEGSON, Champion Cyclist of N.S. Wales, says :—“ I
suffered keenly from nervousness. I was on the point of a con-
stitutional break-up more than once. Your treatment restored
me to a strength of which I had despaired. The merit of
your Electric ‘ Invigorator ’ is beyond question.
“ (Signed) J. Megson, March, 1902.”
Mr. G. JOHNS, Champion Light-weight Pugilist of Australia
affirms :—“ I have worn one of your ‘ Invigorators ’ during train-
ing for contests in Sydney, and have found it most beneficial to
my nerve and physical systems. Your Electro-Medical treatment
has done me undoubted good, both in training and actual
contests. (Signed) G. Johns, April, 1902.”
And Mr. W. CAHACAN, ex-Champion Cyclist N.S.W. League
of Wheelmen, declares :—“ I have worn your Electric “ Invigor-
ator” during training for my principle bicycle matches, and
always found relief through its application. It has a most
strengthening effect upon the nervous and muscular systems. I
attribute much of my success to its immediate use.
“(Signed) W. Gahagan, March, 1902.”
(Don’t these TESTIMONIALS ease your hearts ? What we
have done for them we can do f:r you.)
Our Postal Systems.
The world to-day with its net-work of electric cables and tele-
graphs has been described “as a mere bundle of nerves.”
Messages can be sent to the ends of the earth in a few minutes.
We have a perfect postal system. Any patient will receive a
reply to his or her letters in a few hours. All letters are treated
with privacy’, and medicines are forwarded free from observation
to any address. For opinions upon any case the Specialists do
not charge. The rich and poor are treated alike. A faithful
diagnosis of any complaint will be given, but the symptoms and
direction of it must he correctly described. The Specialists’ ser-
vices are given in the interests of suffering humanity, their fees
are moderate, and their methods effective.
How We Restore to Health and Happiness.
After reading the above testimonials you will reflect upon your own condition. In order to be com-
pletely cured of a disease, proper treatment must be adopted. Our special medicines taken correctly, whilst
one of our marvellous Electric “ Invigorators ” are worn, will cure the most obstinate case of Physical
Weakness in a few weeks. Enfeebled constitutions are one of our Specialities. Persons about to marry, or
about to take long journeys, should consult us. The Prices of our wonderful health-creating “ Invigorators ”
are Copper-Plated, £1; Silver-Plated, £1 10s.; Solid Silver, £3; Solid Cold (stamped), £lO.
You should not pay any more for this wonderful instrument, which assists Nature in regaining her strength.
It will cure you when all your doctors fail. As a renovative agent in cases of Vital Weakness,
Insomnia, Palpitation, Disordered Functions, Sciatica, Nerve and Brain Complaints, it has no equal. Our
20s. Belt is better value than Belts sold at £lO elsewhere.

AN OPEN INVITATION.
UST because we have a Splendidly Stocked and Handsome Shop, and because we have sense enough to
know that well-made and well-fitted Windows and Show Cases serve to keep the Stock in A 1 condition,
is no reason why you should think that our prices must be high. Don’t for a moment think that our
shop is too grand for you or that you can get more for your money in a smaller place. If you do think so you
make a big mistake, and the sooner you give us the opportunity to prove that this is so the better will it be for
you. Does it not stand to reason that we, with our six popular Australasian stores (two more will be opened
in a couple of months, one in Brisbane and the other in Dunedin, N.Z.) can buy in larger quantities and sell at
lower prices than single shops ? Is not the possession of these six stores proof that our prices please the public?
Next time you want anything in our line, come in and see how well and how cheaply we can supply your
wants. It will cost you nothing to look round and get all the information you want, and even if you don’t buy
we won’t be offended. Let the purse be fat or lean, the same careful and courteous attention is given to all.
If you are out of town your name and address on a post card will bring our 1902 Catalogue, and you will see
that we can serve you just as carefully by post as if you were standing before the counter.
Watch
to depend on.
rpHAT is the only kind we stock, because we know
that a Watch that does not keep time is much
worse than no Watch at all. We quote a few prices
and our Watch Catalogue tells of the others. You

Indigestion and Kidney Troubles Cured—

Sensation.
When the doctor leaves, and says the case is

I
hopeless, what remains to
be done? Nothing, if
the doctor’s word is final.
Much, if you will listen
to men and women who
were once “hopeless
cases,” given up by doctors,
and who were perfectly and
permanently cured by the
use of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. This is the
strong and reliable evidence
of Mr. J. A. Anderson,
who resides at 193 Kent-
street, Sydney. The facts
are well worthy of publica-
tion, for they have the ring
of truth so clear and
positive as to be unmis-
takable. “I have been a
great sufferer from indiges-
tion and kidney troubles.
In fact, my case was so bad
that I was compelled to
remain in the hospital for
four weeks. And, previous
to this, I consulted many doctors, and tried
many remedies, but nothing did effect a cure.
1 saw Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills advertised
in a paper, and as a last resort decided to give
them a trial. The change they effected was,
remarkable ; they restored me to health and strength
when other so-called remedies had failed. I can
and do recommend them as being a medicine
without equal, and, furthermore, believe they
will do all that is claimed for them. You are at
liberty to use my testimonial as you think fit,
and I shall always take pleasure in recommending
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills to my friends as an
honest medicine, one that will do all that
is claimed for it.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills are a perfect blood purifier, and positive
cure for biliousness, indigestion, constipation,
headaches, sallow complexion, liver and kidney
troubles, piles, pimples, boils and blotches, and
for female ailments. Sold by chemists and
storekeepers, Is. per bottle, or six bottles

SPORTING NOTIONS.
ordenfeldt—Golden Fleece mare Argo made
hacks of her field in the big thing of Sydney Tatt's.
meeting, Saturday, when she cantered home six lengths
ahead of Oxenham’s T.M.S. who has heaped up quite a
record of seconds. A peculiarity of the betting was that
Argo opened up at threes and never shifted from that till
flagfall, which fact made many cute punters, not behind
the scenes, hesitate, where they would have had a big
win otherwise. Though the prize value of the race
exceeded that of any other on the programme by £5O, the
line-up was much poorer in quality and numbers than
has been seen in an important event at Randwick for a
very long time.
* • * *
Success of Transvaal in Welter, at Randwick,
Saturday, caused a hostile demonstration. He previously
started first favorite in Tatt.’s Stakes (6 furlongs), with
F. Kuhn up, and, after running well forward into the
straight, faded away to an indifferent third. Welter was
2fur. further, but there was no fade in that, which may
have been due to Bardon’s superior riding, for, though
the stable put the money down freely for the 6fur. event,
it had little or nothing on in the mile—the nag started
at 10’s offered. Transvaal is a big upstanding gelding by
Fusileer from Maggie Moore, and is said to be an excel-
lent performer in private.
* * * *
Flying Handicap (6fur.) field of seven at Tatt.’tf’
meet, Saturday, made Mo.’s volume a picture through
the amount of betting they caused. Alfonso, coming
from Richmond and endorsed a “cert.," lined up favorite
at twos, but loads of coin went on Ferryman and Suivre
(fours), Canadian and Alannah (fives), and fractious Rose
Petal (eights). Canadian won cleverly in 1.16, and
gathered in a big parcel of wagers totalling over £12,000
for owner “ Teddy ” Knight alone, who got all his at 5£
and, sixes—an exceptionally good price considering the
nag’s form of late. Canadian’s recent performances
include winning Canterbury Park Shorts Handicap last
month, second to Whirlpool in S.T.C. May Stakes, and
second to Argo at Rosehill Saturday week. Canadian is

some big bets each time.

J. Barden’s horsemanship on Transvaal in
Tatts. Welter Handicap, Saturday, stamped him the best
rider this State owns- His great rival, F. Kuhn, was up
on Whirlpool, and at the distance looked to have the race
to himself, but Barden, coming with a well-judged run,
drew up level 100 yards from home, and struggling
gamely on despite Kuhn’s response, won cleverly by three
parts of a length, amid intense excitement. Kuhn was
palpably outridden in as fair a set-to as could be.

Lord Bundoora—Sunbeam six-year-old nag Wol-
logorang jumped brilliantly at his first public appearance
at Tatt.’s Randwick meet, Saturday. Chevally, recog-
nising that Wollogorang was a hard puller, gave him his
head, and he flew the jumps like a bird, and finished
with a big margin to the good. Strong and fast, Wollo-
gorang should shine at the “illegitimate ” game, and is a
decided acquisition thereto. Was bred by Mr. H. Chis-
holm, and gets his name from that sportsman’s estate, in
the Goulburn district.

“Ichabod”: Whilom leviathan Mo. Oxenham
went Englandwards for the third time Monday; future
movements very uncertain. After the English racing
season, he’ll probably shift to S’Africa for a time, if fight-
ing ceases ; and then to Australia or England, according
to circumstances. It’s an open secret that fortune hasn’t
favored “ Oxy” too much lately, and, being debarred from
“ fielding ” through running a “ shop,” he has “ punted,”
with the inevitable result. Australian Mo-dom will miss
him, as he led every move for its benefit, and could work
a powerful lever when necessary. There was no “ send-
off ” this time. Previous two departures were marked by
big champagne sprees, at Sydney Town Hall and in Tatt.’s
club-room.

The world has not yet done with “ Tattersall ”
Adams. His sweeps are still in full blast, he is starting
a brewery at Hobart with the idea of doing a big export
trade, and he is exploiting the smokeless coal from his
big Bulli colliery.
N.S.W. nags Lucknow and Rabato ran first and
second in Q.T.C. Queen’s Plate (a w.f.a. race) Saturday.
The money was a gift to Lucknow who went out 2 to 1
“ on.” Same prad is in Brisbane Cup (2m.) with 10.4 and
Moreton H’cap (lfin.) with 10.6. Now denied that brother
and_ sister Lucknow and Bother were bred from a
“Kingston mare.” And said that origin of the pair can
be traced to a mare, owned years back by Mr. Iceiy, of
Coombing Park near Carcoar (N.S.W.), who possessed a
filly foal by an unknown sire ; said filly, later, threw a
foal to an Arab horse named Trojan, and Lucknow and
Bother are both out of that mare, which is more con-
fusing than ever.

Said that three horses could have beaten The
Idler in the Adelaide Cup but for foul riding. Every
big event brings another outcry against cronk jockey-
ship, without leading to any practical suggestion for the
cure of the evil. The mannikin perpetrators of daylight
robbery and ruffianism under the name of “-sport were
never more defiant in their attitude to the turf authori-
ties than they are to-day, which is tantamount to saying
that racecourse management in general has gone from
bad to worse of late years. The stewards of the two
ruling clubs—the V.R.C. and A.J.G.—seem incapable of
a serious effort to protect the interests of those few
owners, including stewards themselves, who ask for
nothing but a fair “go” for their horses every time.
Foul riding has come to be spoken of as one of the in-
evitable risks in the race game, and “ mulling” is referred
to as a comparatively venial offence which enhances the
value of a straight jockey. For he, whatever his artistic
demerits, can at least be depended on to do his best to
win. Honesty, rather than skill, accounts for the recent
success of one very notable Australian horseman. He
got first-class mounts because his character was good.
The “ books” couldn’t stiffen the animal he was bestrid-
ing, consequently he was a more desirable sort of duffer
to entrust with the control of a genuine favorite than if
he had been a member of the rascally “ jockey ring.”

The Leslie Macdonald clan is said to have re-
fused an offer from England of £3BOO for Wakeful. The
value of Wakeful as an Australian racer, now that she is
doomed to “crushing” weights in handicaps, would
probably be fixed at something less than £3OOO by an
arbitrator, though there are several £5OO w.f.a. races open
to the little mare between Oct. and April next. On the
other hand, £3BOO seems a poor price for an English
speculator to offer for a mare of Wakeful’s speed, stamina
and breeding. Given a year of racing life on the other
side of the water, she would probably get back all the
purchase-money before starting to yield valuable off-
spring. But Australia would be sorry to lose its noblest
equine daughter.

“G.”: A Saturday afternoon scene in Ade-
laide : Crowds of all sorts and conditions of people in
front of the newspaper office and reaching across the
broad street to the expectoration swamp on the opposite
pavement, where stand knots of bookies, ’Arries, cabmen
and policemen. For 100 yards down street scores of
women, old and young, respectable-looking or otherwise,
either hang about in groups, talking earnestly, or stand
or squat on the kerb, waiting patiently for the racing
results. As soon as the news is posted a blind rush by
the winners to the place tote. The ‘’coppers" stand
around and smile complacently. Saw a youth go up to a
policeman and remark, “Now’s the time to catch 'em,
old man ! ” “No fear,” replied the “ cop” ; “ there’s a
bloke in there collecting for me on this race I ”

In the Australians v. Surrey match the
feature was Bilowell’s bagging 11 wickets for 56,
which recalls that last tour saw him get the whole of
Surrey out for 28 in one innings and 5 for 29 in another.
Then Australia beat Surrey by an innings and 71 runs
(this time by an innings and 78 runs).

Australians opposed Essex, Thursday, last week,
but rain again interfered. First day’s play resulted in the
downfall of eight English wickets for 157 on a wicket not
at any time difficult. Second day saw all out for 178. One
Australian (Trumper, 9) had been secured for 59 when
rain stopped further proceedings. On the third day,
when eight Australians had notched 249 and declared their
innings closed, and two Essex men were out in the second
essay for 13, more bad weather blocked further progress
and the match was drawn. Clem Hill (104), in Austra-
lians’ second innings, supplied the third individual
century of the tour. It was a coincidence that on this
occasion, as when the innings was declared closed against
Surrey, Noble and Armstrong were the not-out men.
Being denied the opportunity to play the game out un-
doubtedly deprived Australia of a chance of avenging
that sensational defeat by Essex on the occasion of the
last tour.
* * * *
Up to and inclusive of the Essex match, Kelly
headed the batting averages of Australians with 74-00 for
three innings and twice out, but Darling’s achievement
(54'20 for five innings, and once out) is considerably
better ; he scored 128 in one effort, and aggregated 271.
Howell tops the bowling—3o3 runs for 20 wickets, giving
an average of 15-15. Vic. Trumper ranks next with 123
runs for 8 wickets ; averaging 15-37.

Australia-Leicestershire match progresses as
Tire Bulletin is being printed. Of 15 first-class counties
engaged last season Leicester ranked twelfth at the
close. Bowling was its special weakness, but later it
unearthed a promising man in W. O’Dell, from whom
m ich is expected. The ’OO Australian invaders squelched
Leicestershire by 248. Rain prevented anything being
done on the first day, but the finish was sensational.
Starting their second essay at 12.5 Australians accumu-
lated 177 (for 3 wickets) by 2 o’clock, and then declared
the innings closed. Following upon this exceptional
hitting came some extraordinary bowling by the visitors,
they had all the home team’s wickets scattered before
four, and for 28. At one stage there were 7 out for 4.
Worrall contributed 100 of the Australians’ second total.
It was against Leicestershire (24 years ago) that old-timer
Charlie Bannerman piled the first century (133) off Eng-
lish bowling in England, by an Australian.

An amateur the real lily-white English
cricket-team will probably tour Maoriland. Lord Hawke
has Written asking what expenses could be allowed and
remarking that “ amateurs travelling with my team have
had passages, out and home, and hotel bills paid— we pay
for our own wine and cigars.” Hitherto “ our wine and
cigar” exes, have amounted to about one smoke and two
hocks a,nd sodas in a week : all the rest included in the
hotel bill. Maoriland Cricket Council will have to find at
least £2OOO, which it is proposed to raise from the pro-
vincial districts according to population. The tour will
probably embrace 11 matches extending over two months.

Sydney football season proper started Saturday.
Among the first flights Eastern Suburbs succeeded
against North Sydney by 3 points (a penalty goal) to nil.
’Varsity, with brilliant passing, made light of South
Sydney, which went under 24 to 6. Western Suburbs had
Glebe all out, and was defeated by 15 to 12 only. Glebe
tied with ’Varsity for last year’s premiership. Newtown
fairly romped over Balmain, accumulating 20 to 3.

Melbourne football season opened t’other day
in a revived odor of sanctity—almost of boom-time
appreciation. Biggest crowd rolled up to see last year’s
premiers—Essendon—wipe the turf with Fitzroy (which
they didn’t), but the best value for money was provided,
as usual, at the Junior, or Association matches. These
don’t play the game too strictly but they make it more
willing. “ Ports,” who have an unenviable reputation
for roughness, took half a hundred barrackers to help
them lay out Richmond. They also failed. Kicking of
grounded players—-accidental, of course, but suspiciously
frequent—was the rule and several \yere cautioned.
The half-hundred barrackers began “slinging off”
at “ Dirty Richmond ” and were promptly bundled into a
corner and pelted with clods, whereupon one whipped
out a revolver and threatened to perforate the first man
who touched him. Someone slipped behind him and
snatched the unloaded shooter and ere he realised what
sort of an earthquake had come to pass he was bundled
over a 6ft. fence with barbed- wire entanglements,
arriving in the street in a damaged condition. After
which there was peace awhile. At the finish Richmond-
ites rushed the ground with intent to “ deal with ” the
Port players, but latter’s opponents and a few police
managed to get them into the pavilion untouched. A
tidy crowd waited about till dark—over an hour—then
broke up disgusted. As for the umpire, the poor man
did his best and was fairer than most, but writer wouldn’t
take his billet under £lO,OOO a year with a heavy life-
assurance thrown in.

‘ I Crab ” : N. S. W. ’s very much rearward position
in inter-State 8-oar race was discussed at last week’s
meeting of the Rowing Association, and a suggestion
made that the amateur definition be liberalised so as to
bring in manual laborers, and thus improve and widen
the scope of selection. The root of the matter ; for the
very/section of the community which, by reason of its
physical advantages, should make the best showing is
completely shut out through the silly snobbishness of
drawing a line between the counter-jumper and
office-clerk and the man whose hands and arms are the
major part of his stock in trade. Victoria has
welcomed the manual-labor man for years past, and
Victorian oar-rowing has consequentlv prospered and
transcended that of N.S.W. considerably. N.S.W.’s
champion scullers have always come froni the manual-
labor class, and never since the days of George Brett (who
belonged more to the tabooed section than the others)
has one of that State’s top-notch, lily-white amateurs
been able to row alongside a front-rank professional—not
because they haven’t as good a grasp of the business, but
because they are, as a rule, without the physical essen-
tials. That absence of thew and stamina liad all to do
with the poor display made by New South Welshmen in
Adelaide last Saturday week.

Returned members of N.S.W. 8-oar crew explain
that there was nothing wrong with them bar lack of pace
though they rowed a faster stroke than the others. Said
that the crew did a trial over the full course on the
previous Wednesday in 16.45—225ec5. better than the
time of race put up under similar conditions bar
the excitement which probably made'N.S.W. work
“ scratchy.” Q. men opine that N.S.W. rowed too short
and too fast to be effective, which is probably correct.

Bruising match last week between old man
black “ Starlight ” and youthful Melbourneite Jack Willis
was mostly scuffle, and both fouled often—the negro
offending most. Entering the 20th and final round it
looked a sure draw, but during the last minute Willis
landed on Starlight’s carelessly exposed jaw with the
force of an ostrich kick, and the ebon}' slept out the
lOsecs. It was a beautiful knock-out, and a complete
surprise for both bruisers and the howling audience.
Starlight, though over 50, is tricky and active enough
to baffle most of the weedy present-day boxers, but Willis
caught him napping. The black avers that during 17
years of active fighting in England and Australia he had
never previously been knocked out clean. One-time
Australian premier middleweight Jim Hall was credited
with having sent the lathy West Indian into slumberland,
but Starlight explains ’twas only a “count out,” he being
too exhausted to continue.

The forthcoming mill between lank Peter Felix
and Westralian Bill Doherty will be the first appearance
of the latter boxer in Melb. since the days when he fought
as a middle-weight. Ere entering the ring, Doherty, a
Footscray quarrvman, was well-known in athletic circles
as a member of the famous Footscray eight-oar-crew that
swept all before it. Perhaps his best-remembered fight
in Melbourne was against Tom Duggan for the m.w.
championship. Though the decision was against Doherty,
the prevailing opinion was that he won.

Fight between crack N.S.W. 9st. 31b. man,
Bob Turner, and Westralian middleweight, Tom Dunne,
at Sydney Golden Gate A. 0., Saturday night, was sized
up soft for Turner. Tens were laid on the Sydney lad,
and fives freely offered, so good did it look, but Dunne’s
clinching, gripping, and “ smothering ” methods com-
pletely baffled Turner who hit uselessly at arms and
elbows instead of getting home on the body. Turner is
not a punishing fighter, nor is Dunne a stiff thumper,
and the latter was so deficient in stamina that the gong
sound frequently saved him from sinking down, and
dozens of times, he hung tenaciously to Turner’s shanks
to recuperate some. Though willing and vigorous
enough the show was flat, neither landing a clean blow at
any stage and both looking as helpless as calves. Ulti-
mately the referee declared the match a draw, because
the principals had covenanted for that in the event of
both being prepared to go on at the close of 20 rounds,
otherwise Turner might have got the decision.

The secretary of the National Rifle Association
writes to remark that par. (B. 10/5/’O2) as to the Bisley
rifle-meeting puts “an entirely false construction upon
the action of the N.R.A.” He points out that there is
none but entirely amicable feeling between the N.R.A.
and the Defence Force Rifle Association. The N.R.A.
“ had a voice—such as it was—in the selection of the
Bisley team. The D.F.R.A., not having been connected
at any time with the Council did not have any such
voice.” All of which neglects the point at issue : what
was the reason for the N.R.A, opposition to the Bisley
scheme ?

It seems that the heavy “ squaring ” of certain
noble sports who started in the Austral final (not to
mention Bill Martin’s preliminary heat) was conditional in
every case upon the ultimate victory of William the
Plugger, though one or two of the neediest men stipu-
lated for a little cash before the event —a restraining fee,
so to speak. Four only—apart from Martin—were honest
triers. The others divided £3200 among them, in
unequal proportions, when the coup had been duly
accomplished and the “books” had settled with the
Wren-Martin stable. What does the League of Wheelmen
say to this ?

“D.W.”: Sport is no sooner born than the
gambling bacillus gets in its mandib es. Dropping in to
witness Rickards’ girls play net-ball at Melb. Opera House
t’other night, I overheard a couple of horsey-looking per-
sons cursing at the progress of the game. “ Just my
luck ! ” said one—“ I dropped two quid on the Blues last
week, and I reckoned to get even to-night. Holy wars !
look at that now 1 I’ll swear that girl’s not a trier.
D’you think she could miss a shot like that. My Gawd !
it’s awful the way things is goin’. There goes another

ended the game.

That the failures of Maclaren’s team in Aus-
tralia are doing well against the Australian Eleven now
in England shows again that a successful cricketer in
England is not always ditto in Australia, especially in
batting. This fact is urged against the exclusion of
Worrall from the present team. Jack W. might not be
the best on averages in Australia, but he is about the
only man available who might turn a losing game into a
winning one on English wickets.

Burly Redfern (Sydney) blacksmith, Tom
Taylor, after years at his trade, wants to fight ’Murkan
heavyweight Jim Scanlan. Tom was good in his time
and plucky, but it doesn’t seem possible for him to shape
fit now. However, he swears he can, and has friends
who’ll back him. He has never been completely away
from the business, as he runs a boxing school which turns
out no duffers and some real fighters. In the later stages
of his teaching he makes it very willing, and insists upon
the youngsters punching him hard, and one or two of
them have knocked the old war horse out occasionally
and badly shaken up a twice-broken jaw. When Peter
Jackson gave lessons at the old “Lighthouse” Hotel in
Bathurst-st., Sydney, and had the biggest muster of
pupils a champion pugilist ever got together, Tom Taylor
was his pet as a forceful, hard puncher and glutton for
thumps. In those days Billy M‘Carthy, Billy Smith,
Steve O’Donnell, Bob Fitzsimmons, Tom Meadows, Dan
Hickey, Martin Denny, and others who shone since sat
round the room waiting their turn.

Road-racing in Sydney is likely to boom during
the winter, especially in amateur circles. The Dunlop
Tyre Go., Sydney, is instituting a series of amateur
inter-club road contests, which will be carried out by the
N.S.W. Union. As this body has a very large number of
Sydney clubs affiliated, the competition, for which the
Dunlop Co. is offering a £2O trophy and four gold
medals to the winning team, is likely to lead to a series
of keen contests and healthy rivalry between the amateur
clubs during the winter months. Fur her details of the
proposed club competition will be available at an early

The pawky Mr. James Ashton, M.L.A.
(N.S, W.), has passed the final Bar examination.
Nearly every N.S.W. M.P. seems nowadays to be
reading for the Bar. One of them, when he first
struck Euclid, was so astonished by its logical
beauty (he had never seen anything logical before)
that he used to button-hole fellow-members and
try to bring to their minds some glimmer of the
great truth that “ things which are equal to the
same thing are equal to one another.”
Brisbane Courier and other papers declare
that the conduct of the Postmaster-General in
allowing Cobb and Co.’s mail services to stop (they
have now resumed again) was another horrible
example of Government incapacity, &c. The
stoppage came about because, through drought
and other circumstances, it costs more to run the
services than Cobb and Co. had agreed to accept.
The P.M.G. could only have interfered earlier by
paying Cobb and Co. a lot more money than was
specified in the contract. Of course, he may have
to do that now, but now he has the collapse of the
old contractors to point to as proof that he didn’t
begin to splash money about till it was unavoid-
able. If he had averted that collapse the same
conscientious papers would have declared that
there was never going to be any collapse; they
might even have insinuated that his conduct was
another degrading conspiracy to shovel out the
public funds to favored parties, who gave him 10
per cent, commission on the steal.

George Alexander, manager of St James’ Theatre
(London), lately announced his intention of legislating
against late-comers, who stroll languidly into the reserved
stalls long after the curtain has gone up, and annoy the
audience behind them as much as they damage the
dramatic feelings of the actors on the stage. Nobody
will be allowed to enter the auditorium whilst
an act is proceeding —if Alexander has the
courage of his ukase. Late-comers at the St.
James’ will have to wait in the corridor until the
“number” is over, like the after 8 o’clock arrivals at a
classical concert. But seeing that even a sonata is not so
long as a section of a play, and the “plot” of a sonata
doesn’t amount to an interesting fact, the concert rule
seems a hard thing to put into practice at theatres.
If George Alexander, the West End manager, is
a smart tactician, he will adopt an East End cure
for the complaint. Nobody annoys the audience a second
time by swaggering into an East End the-a-ter whilst
the “drammer” is under weigh. To do it once is to he
crushed. A couple of voices in the gallery suffice to make
the delinquents sorry for their indiscretion, and the same
voices could he laid on at Alexander’s house. When
Lord and Lady Languid came along to disturb the show
voice No. 1 would say, “ You’re a hit late, Pussy. Muvver
was took bad just as you was startin’ and you ad’ to
poultice her till you missed the ’bus, I suppose.” Then
voice No. 2, “Uv course ’e did. But w’y ” (this is a tone
of pained astonishment) “did Liser tear ’erself away from
the old gal ? Liser, you ought to be ashamed of yerself
for leaving the inverleed. You can’t enjoy the play,
knowin’ that Pussy’s muvver is korfin’ her ’eart up.” A
few doses of cockney badinage would put the “bloomin’
kybosh ”on the late-arrival nuisance. A Duke and
Duchess will bustle up to avoid the penalty of being
chaffed by the lowah ordahs, bai Jove !
Not generally know that the first chapter of Brough-
Boucicault management in Australia was very gloomy,
in a financial sense. What time Harwood figured as
“associate-manager” in the young firm, and they ran a
composite comedy and burlesque co., with their head-
quarters at Melb. Opera House, their operations resulted
in a loss of £lO,OOO, it was said, to the squattah who was
financing them. The deficit was rapidly recovered after
they got fairly going at the Bijou towards the end of
’B7, and the capitalist saw all his money back during the
B. and B. golden time, which concluded with the burning
of the Bijou on Easter Monday, ’B9. A year later the
partners, who had been going strong at Sydney mean-
while, opened the new Bijou. Their luck was out at first,
then came a long run of success, which slackened until
finally, on Dec. 17, ’92, they gave up their lease and
took a “ farewell testimonial benefit.” The Bijou saw
Boucicault no more after that, the firm’s subsequent re-
appearances in Melbourne being confined to occasional
seasons at the Princess’s. But in Nov., 96, and again in
’9B, Brough came back to the Bijou “ on his own.”
Said that King Edward jibs at the idea of making the
London theatres and ’alls free to the public on his
Coronation night. There are now some fifty houses, so
the claims of all the managements would amount to
about £lO,OO0 —five times as much as Queen Victoria was
called upon to pay when she gave the cockney populace
the usual Coronation treat. The King reckons that
£lO,OOO distributed in any other way would seem more of
a “ royal bounty,” and that fairly intelligent monarch is
probably right in his reckoning. On the other hand,
there is Precedent to consider. It is dangerous for kings
to make light of precedent. Thrones are based on pre-
cedent. All the good things that Ned has ever enjoyed
in this world were the privileges of his precedented billet,
and, considering how many ridiculous precedents are
attached to a Coronation, H.M. might as well approve of
the one and only theatrical item on the programme which
is not very absurd.
The English law' of copyright for dramatists seemimrly
can’t touch a compound piracy of titles. A flourishing
farce, suggested by the awful popularity of “ Jones ” and
“Smith,” is called “ Why Jones Left Home.” Presum-
ably “The Wrong Mrs. Wright” would be beyond the
reach of an injunction.
When Brough and Boucicault visited Charters Towers
some years ago two of the co. were having a glass of beer
after the show, when they were joined by a friendly
native. “ ’Ullo, Mister bianky Brooginbookicalt 1 ’ave
a drink along o’ me.” “ No, thank you,” said one of
them, a very stately personage. “We have just had
one." “ Well, ’ave another,” continued the affable
savage, “I don’t mind. I’m used ter messin’ around
with theatricals.”
Chief Justice Madden of Victoria did an
unusually business-like thing the other day. A
t'uror failed to turn up, and it was explained that
e was dead, but the evidence on the point being
insufficient the tC. J. fined the corpse £2 2s. as a
precaution. If he is dead lie won’t pay, and if he
is alive it will be a warning to him not to be so
dead next time.
Before Judge Edwards (M.L.) recently, a
youngster of sixteen was brought up for sentence.
On being asked whether he had anything to say,
lie broke into tears, and asked to be let off,
as “he wanted to go to the races to-morrow.”
The unsympathetic judge gave him two years—
and took the next day off to go to the races him-
self.
Chief Justice Way had to emulate
Solomon’s judgment at Adelaide, t’other day.
A casual S.A. girl had a casual baby, some years
ago, and left it with a friend while she went West
to look for a husband. It took some time to find
one who would not object to the ready-made
family, and when the nine-year-okl child was sent
for, the foster-mother refused to give her up. So
a writ of habeas corpus brought all parties into
court. The child was found not to know the
alphabet or “Our Father.” There was a certain
grim appropriateness about the latter point, but
the indignant C.J. at once handed her over,
screaming, to her original mother.
“A Lady Passenger” tells an almost
incredible story to Melb. Age as to what may
happen to a mere ordinary paying traveller on the
Vic. railways. Returning from Geelong to Mel-
bourne by an evening train she was politely desired
by the stationmaster to get out of the lst-class
non-smoking compartment, where she had taken
her seat, in order that “ a Minister and some of
his departmental officials ” might have it to them-
selves for smoking. When she got into another
carriage “a lady occupant said that on four
occasions the same thing had happened to her,
and once she had been turned out of a ladies’
carriage to make room for three officials who
wanted to smoke.” The Vic. railways seem to
be run for deadheads simply.
The constant demands of a section of the
Westralian Federal members for reductions in the
tariff reveal a very bad weak spot (only a tem-
porary one, happily) in the Constitution. Wes-
tralia is allowed, for five years, to levy duties on
imports from the other States as well as from
outside, and it is the only State so situated. In
other words, it levies duties on all its imports—
the other States on a little more than half theirs—
therefore, it can raise its revenue with lower duties
than its neighbors, and with a brutally-selfish
disregard of any interests save their own, the
majority of its representatives stand by the low-
tariff interest. Said low tariff, when the period
of inter-State duties expires, will probably leave
Westralia itself in a spacious and well-deserved
hole.
There has not been a more interesting
Australian book published for a long time than
“Bushman and Buccaneer”—giving the life and
writings of Harry Morant (“The Breaker”).
Every bushman will want to buy a copy for the
sake of the complete collection of “The Breaker’s”
verses which it contains. The book gives a photo-
graphic reproduction of the “ copy ” of Morant’a
last verses, written in gaol, and many illustrations,
from authentic photographs, of the Bush veldt
Carbineers’ operations. Price one shilling.

Tom Kennedy, the sorely-afflicted secretary of the Dis-
tressed Actors’ Fund, is to have a matinee-benefit at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), on Friday, the 30th. For many years,
Kennedy was a busy administrator of the Fund’s boun-
ties, and his claim for a benefit was admitted long before
he met with the accident which led to his present terrible
plight. A big programme is promised.
Janet Waldorf’s not unnatural pride in her shapely legs
is rather a handicap on “ As You Like It.” The fair Yank
never lets a chance pass for displaying her beauteous
form, and the cloak she wears is held constantly behind
her for fear it should interrupt the view. That much is
all right, but the contrast of Janet’s plump and symmet-
rical understandings with the misshaped spindleslianks of
the male supers turns the latter into grotesque degener-
ates, who excite laughter instead of being attributes of a
comprehensive picture. Either a precedent should be
established by playing Rosalind in skirts throughout, or
else the supers should be enveloped in several Dales of
padding.
"S.S.”: Where on earth did Williamson collect his
male supers for the Janet Waldorf season ? Was ever
such a procession of wretched legs put upon any stage ?
Had the sole aim of the management been to bring into
prominence the excellence of the female legs employed
on this job, it could not have collected a more miserable
bundle of props outside the Benevolent Asvlum walls ;
and yet the supers were young men. Surely it cannot
be, as has been whispered, that the desire was to prevent
Romeo’s legs appearing to great disadvantage ? Romeo's
legs were about as fat as a match, and apparently no
expense was spared to discover a dozen sets that
resembled so many lengths of chewed cord.
Yankee clipping (N.Y. World) Melba Discovers a
Fij’a.—Monaco, Dec. 14.—Mme. Melba, who is still pur-
suing luck at Monte Carlo, has just discovered a com-
Eatnot of hers, Muriel Mayston, who is extraordinarily
andsome and whose voice Melba claims is superior to
anything that ever issued from a woman’s throat. Miss
Mayston arrived here penniless, having sacrificed every-
thing for a voyage from Australia irv order to meet
Melba, The latter took complete charge of her, saying :
‘Within a year you won’t know what to do with the
money they’ll offer you.”’ Does anybody know “Miss
Mayston?”
“ E.": The truth about Lotty, at Melb. Opera House,
is just this. The city expected her to be a “ spicy ”
entertainment, and was prepared to applaud her
vehemently. It found her to be merely a mild and pretty
show, and felt disappointed. What is there in Lotty’s
lantern-lightings to call for a violent outbreak of applause
at the conclusion of the series ?
At Perth (W.A.) City Court, the other day, two mem-
bers of the Hawtrey Comedy Co.—Gregan Macmahon and
Miss Laura Nicholls—were charged with obstructing the
traffic at the corner of Hay and Barrack streets. The
inevitable constable told them to move on, and Mac-
mahon resented the officer’s insult to the profesh by call-
ing him “an offensive cad.” Evidently the impersonator
of Parker doesn’t live up to his character off the stage.
In the “Message from Mars,” he remarks “Splendid
force, the police 1 ”
Lucy Wilson, the leading lady of Musgrove’s dramatic
co. except when “ Sweet Nell ” holds the floor, is said to
be a more powerful actress than her clever sister, Dora de
Winton, who came to Australia awhile ago with her
husband, Charles Saunders, and played lachrymose
heroines under Holloway’s management. Another sister,
Agnes Wilson, is considered quite equal to Lucy. The
three girls represent the strongest combination of family
talent on the British stage, but they have not yet had the
luck to strike celebrity.
“W.G.,” from Auckland: “The much-boomed Amy
Castles opened here on the 12th, after a hurried scamper
through the South. Management auctioned the pews
and got up to 14s. for circles, front row. Father Paterson
the little Scotch priest of St. Patrick’s, took the first
batch at half-a-sovereign ; he drove out on Saturday to
meet the steamer, and took the singer to interview
the Bishop. Some pood local opinion places Dani and
Nora M’Kay before the Bendigonian. Ever since the tour
of the throaty lords of the Musgrove Grand Opera Maori-
land has been pinin'? for a good tenor of the light variety
and Dani fills the bill; he was encored six times for one
effort. The little Maryborough girl with the fiddle has
won all hearts here, and, when she comes alono- on a
starring tour later on, she will find plenty of “ followers
of early form ” to battle at the doors. In spite of over-
booming, Miss Castles leaves a good impression behind
her.
“ F.”: A recent Bulletin par concerning the Vic
Artists’ Smoke Night, in aid of the Victor Daley fund'
was particularly unfair to John Forde Paterson, who as
President of the V.A.S., went to so much trouble’ in
getting subscriptions from outside capitalists. The amount
of £l4 net, which according to theuntruthful paragraphist
came from “ the artists, not the hide-bound society ” was
mostly the result of Mr. Paterson’s personal endeavor
and influence, not to mention his own personal guinea.
The rally of artists at the smoke-night was not lar«-e
When it is stated that Councillor James Moloney, White
Knight Fitzgibbon, Fred. Sargood, Mr. Panton. P.M
Mr. Stanford, Dr. Mclnerney, tenor Gregor Wood, and
Henry Gyles Turner were accountable for £9 13s. of the
subscriptions, apart from J.F.P.’s guinea, enough has
been s&id.
“ H.G.” : Shakespeare is becoming expurgated beyond
even the limits of the W.C.T. U. According to the revised
version of “ Romeo and Juliet,” as produced at Melb
Her Majesty’s, every vestige of the foundation-story
(Boccacio s Nightingale yarn) has been taken from the
balcony scene ; and, instead of the lover pouring his
passion into the willing ear of Juliet, with their arms
entwined, he now stands on the ground and swops sweet
nothings with his mistress on a balcony 10ft. above his
head. Bytheway, why will someaotorsand actresses month
Shakespeare so? Miss Waldorf’s lines, as Juliet, could
be written according to musical notation, so exaggerated
is her inflection. One of the great secrets of Bernhardt’s
success is her natural, even modulation, which makes
every point tell without ever degenerating to monotony
The great woman never allows her sentences to fall into
the ooh-ah-ow-ee-ooh-ooh-aw ” pronounciation of the
average Shakespearian mummer.
The great charm of juggler Salerno’s work is its appar-
ent impromptu effect, as, for instance, his jugglin'* with
a top-hat, umbrella, and cigar ; throwing his handker-
chief across the stage into the pocket of his coat which is
apparently hanging carelessly on a stand, and, again his
feat of pulling a table-cloth off a fully-laid table without
displacing a single article, merely to wipe his hands
before doing another trick.
Miss Marguerite Henderson, the best Vic. soprano who
thusfar has come forth from Marshall-Hall’s Conserva-
torium, seems to have secured a musical footing in Eng-
land. At anyrate, a London agent talks of getting
engagements for her. To be booked by an agent is some-
thing, whereas the cable announcement that Miss Hen-
derson gave a concert at St. James’ Hall and “ achieved a
complete success ” means practically nothing worth
cabling about. Every singer who can afford to give a
concert at St. James’ Hall is an assured “ success.” The
trouble is to get a posiC -n as a recognised salaried artist
on the London concert-p.-jform, nowadays.
Truda, the well-known Brisbane violinist, was given a
farewell benefit concert, the other week, and the poor
fellow sailed for his native Italy in the worst of health.

Or its tones can be modulated to the soft, sweet tones of the German Zither,
In addition to its wonderful tone quality, the Harp-Zither has a great many
advantages over all other Zithers. It is the only Zither which may be played
while holding vertically like the Harp, or it may be laid upon a table, as is
necessary with the ordinary Zither.
Observe the diagonally crossed strings, almost the same as in a piano, the
melody strings passing over the chord strings. By means of this improvement
in construction the similarity in tone and volume of the piano is produced.
Beautiful in Design, Grand, Resonant Tone, Perfection in Every Point,
and it is the easiest to learn to play of any musical instrument in existence.
A. chi, ld can play it almost at sight. The reason anyone can play this instru-
ment on first trial, even though the person may know absolutely nothing
about music, or may not have an ear for music, is this : Each string is num-
bered, as is each note in the music, so all one has to do to render the most
difficult selections is to strike the strings as indicated by the numbers • hence
we guarantee that anyone able to read figures can learn to play. ’
The Harp-Zither is built on the lines of the large harp which sells at
£2O and upwards, and to the astonishment of all the Harp-Zither has the
louder tone of the two ; in fact, its tone is similar to that of a piano.

As a parlor ornament, the instrument, with its classical outlines is
unique. For the serenade, the musicale, or any class of entertainment, the
Harp-Zither excels all ofchfcr instruments of its class. Its Deep sympathetic

HERR RASSMUSSEN (HANS PETER RASMUSSEN),
The Celebrated Danish Botanist,
Proprietor and Discoverer of the World-Famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies,
which have been the means of effecting the most marvellous Cures for Blood,
Skin and Nervous Diseases ever heard of in Australia.
Herr Rassmussen’s Australian Career:
It is about Twenty Years since Herr
Rassmussen introduced his Herbal Remedies
to the Australian Public. At that time
he was only known to the public as a Botanist
pure and simple, having devoted almost his
whole life to the study of that most useful
and interesting branch of science. It how-
ever, soon dawned on Herr Ra.ssmussen that
immense virtues existed in many plants which
were entirely unknown to medical men, and
that it was his duty towards his fellow man
to bring these new discovered Herbal Remedies
within the means of suffering humanity.
Herr Rassmtjssen at once set to work,
and his entire energy was directed towards
extracting the medical properties from all
kinds of plants, and putting them up in the
most suitable and practical form, according
to the nature of the complaints which they
had been found a cure for.
Pills and Powders were found to be the
most practical form to administer these new
Herbal Remedies.
It is unnecessary to particularise here the
immense success Herr Rassmussen met with
in his venture twenty years ago ; suffice it to
say that in less than twelve months the
great and wonderful cures brought about by
his Alfaline Herbal Remedies were known
throughout Australia, New Zealand, and many
other parts of the world. Testimonials and
Honors arrived from all parts. Gold Medals
from Paris and other plac< s were awarded, and
Herr Rassmussen’s name has been a house-
hold word ever since. (Sydney Press.)

Fitzgibbon, the Melb. Bard of All Works,
is hard on the heels of O’Sullivan with a scheme
to raise a great structure fronting the dawn on
Eastern Hill, in which to house the Metropolitan
Board and all its encumbrances. But Melbourne
takes much more kindly to the idea of a mausoleum
tor the Metropolitan Board. Fitz., who has the
honor of being about the most expensive man in
ab things considered, wants to spend
fcz4,ooo on his new den.
A yarn with a grim poetic-justice touch
about it is that the plague was first introduced
here by “the climbing mice.” This ingenious
Asiatic cruelty was first brought to Australia in
1899, and was a popular advertising feature in
some city shops. The “climbing mice,” little
white creatures, were imprisoned in a cage, which
hold a circular plane fitted on a loose swivel.
Attempting to climb up this plane to liberty they
would set it revolving, and be kept galloping
hour after hour without getting any “forrader”
(on the same principle as the horse “ galloping ”
on a revolving barrel for the stage race), until
they fell exhausted—to renew their vain efforts at
freedom with the return of strength. It was a
most, cruel affair ; but, like many other cruelties,
was highly popular.

HIS RUPTURE
CORED.
Engineer on the Midland Railway
Restored by the Wonderful Rice
Method.
One of the well-known engineers on the Midland
Railway, having been in their employ a long time,
relates some very interesting facts about how he
cured himself of a bad rupture by the Rice
Method. His name is George Jordan, and is in
good standing, so what he says for the benefit of
other railway men who are ruptured can be relied
upon as truthful and of value.
iglliiljllii
m
27, Bishopstone Boad, Gloucester,
Dr. W. S. Bice. July 21,1901.
Dear Sir,—l am very pleased to say that 1 am
cured of Rupture after using your treatment for
three months, having been ruptured for seventeen
years.
I have already spent a lot of money on treatment,
having paid one doctor sixteen guineas without
getting much good, and I had lost all hope of being
cured until I read your advertisement in Lloyd's
Newspaper.
I acted strictly on your advice, and I have not been
troubled with my Bupture since the first week I tried
your treatment, and although I get a lot of shaking
about (being a locomotive engine driver on the
Midland Bailway), I have not worn a Truss forabou'j
two months, and I do not feel the slightest weakness
now, and am enjoying better health than I have
had for seventeen years. •
You can make what use you like of this letter, as
I am anxious for all sufferers to know of your treat-
ment; and I shall advise all my friends affiicted with
this complaint to use it, as I know it will cure per-
manently.—Your faithfully, George Jordan.
The BICE Method of curing.rupture is as near
perfect as anything could be, and a great many
-remarkable cures have been effected. Every
rur>t' iT '°d railway man should write Dr. W. S. Bice,
9d stonecutter Street, LONDON, E.C., who
will 'send a FREES AMPLE of his method, also
a complete and -illustrated series of pamphlets
showing conclusively that his method cannot fait ol
a cure. It is a home treatment at small cost, with-
out pain, danger, operation, or an hour's detention
from work. Do not fail to write for either yourself
or someone you know to be ruptured.
Unaccountable chip of sense from a church
paper, Yic. Catholic Tribune :
Our devout beliefs are not built, as we suppose, upon
the dry sand of reason, but rest upon the floods of our
affection.
And a flood is a very unstable and washy thing
for any structure to rest upon.
“ ‘Hanged by a knife,'” writes The Bulle-
tin’s London correspondent, “should be the
epitaph on our latest suspended subject. It is not
in main details a new story —just the half-brute,
half-human youth, too common in bush or country
away from towns —a little girl, outrage, murder.
Not a particle of direct evidence except a blood-
stained penknife, caught in the victim’s hair.
He had borrowed the knife to kill rabbits; the
child’s throat had been cut as would have been a
rabbit’s. ‘ Guilty’*—* death ! ’ and the most un-
disturbed person in the court, this beast-boy, ran
gaily out of the dock to the cells. How is it the
country and the bush, far from the ‘city’s crime,’
more often produce the acme of brutality ? ”

A BAD CASE.
Launchley, Uralla, N.S.W.
Dr. McLaughlin supplied me with one of
liis high-grade Belts in February last, and
1 have worn it according to its directions.
The first night or two I felt much worse,
and felt inclined to throw it away, having
used before some of the so-called Electric
Belts, and derived no benefit from them.
Persevered with the Dr. McLaughlin Belt
for one week, and derived the greatest
benefit from it, and consider that it has
ibsolutely cured the Lame Back from
which I suffered for many years, more or
ess.

The Dr. McLaughlin Company,
Dear Sirs,—ln answer to your letter just
received, when I ordered a Belt I had a
bad back, and also weariness in the morn-
ing. Now, after wearing your Belt about
four hours a day, my back is all right, and
I feel quite fresh in the morning. The
weariness has also left me, and the Belt
has done me a great deal of good, con-
sidering I am 72 years of age.

In addition to their national “ smartness ”
Yankee missioners lately exploiting
Melbourne seem to possess an extra allowance of
shrewdness. Local churchians put up their pence,
local parsons gave their gratis services and the
local press boomed the first week’s Simultaneous
Mission -at which there was a pleasing absence
of the usual ‘ plate.” Then the Yanks, having
worked up a boom on the cheap, chipped in
on their own and at the plate for all it
was worth—which, truth to tell, wasn’t much.
And, as a result of all this, the “conversions”
have been so deep and frequent that the city is
now suffering an extra violent attack of burglary
and assault, while the beer-consumption appears to
have rather increased than otherwise.
“Cockney”: “Speaking from a fairly
strong recollection of Moody and Sankey, ]
would say that the “Simultaneous Missioners’
from America, now performing in Melbourne, are
barefaced mummers by comparison with the more
or less religious Revivalists of yore, although
Moody and his mate in their time were more
startlingly unusual than are Geil and his mate to-
day. Times have changed. Booth and his big
drum have happened since the first publication of
Sankey’s Hymn-book. We are advancing. Geil,
after all, is only the far forerunner of some
Gospelic mountebank who will take the stage in
motley and call himself God’s Own Jester, and
stand on his head to deliver a “ prayer.”

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure.
THE FAMOUS REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OP ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain o
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com
foi ling in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption ha
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken a e eginnmg, a ose is generally sufficien
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BEWARE OTP COUGHS!
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

fours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
Irst dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
uu a. different man, and the cough has vanished. You
nay depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
votiderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.

Formalin, the fashionable disinfectant,
comes, like much wisdom, from the ant. When a
bull-dog ant bites you he instils the active
principle of formalin into your tortured skin. It
is said that scientific attention was first drawn to
“ formic acid ” as a germicide by the fact that the
ant is able to store up food for an indefinite time
beneath the earth, killing even the germ life in
seeds, by the use of this secretion. The result was
formalin— said to he more destructive to low forms
of life that any other disinfectant, whilst compara-
tively innocuous to human beings and other highly-
organised animals. A form of it is boomed as
being, when injected into the blood, a cure for
tuberculosis.


THE
/EOLIAN.
“ It seems too good to be true ”
is what one woman writes about the performances of an
she has recently purchased.
She could not believe it possible that she could have in her
own drawing-room an agent through which she could produce
any piece of music ever written, at any time, in a truly
artistic manner with discriminate emphasis and the most
refined expression—thousands of pieces which she could never
otherwise hear; music of all masters, ancient or modern,
of every style and grade of excellence, from a
Palestrina Motet to the latest popular song.
The Quartets, Symphonies, and Sonatas of Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven, Brahms ; the Chorales, the Fugues,
Suites, Sonatas of Bach.
The entire orchestral scores of the music-dramas of Wagner.
The marvellous musical poetry of Schumann and Chopin.
The exquisite songs of Schubert, Franz, and Brahms.
The Overtures of Weber, Rossini, Verdi, Meyerbeer, Donizetti,
Auber, Supp£, Balfe, Thomas,
Gounod, Bizet, Goldmark, Humperdinck.
The fascinating Gypsy music of Hungary—
The Rhapsodies of Liszt.
In short, the whole world of music.
An impression prevails that yEolians are very expensive instruments, and
can only be afforded by the very rich. This is a mistake ; you can buy a good
yEolian for less than you would pay for a piano, and on easy payments. The
cheapest yEolian plays more than five thousand compositions —and plays them
well, too.

Oct. 27th.— This is a 20-knot ship, and ran 1910
knots at her trial—yet we have not averaged 14
knots. At 11 o’clock the ship was doing 17 knots;
four hours later, that is at 3 o’clock this morning,
the speed had gone down to 8 knots. It appears
that the Arabs hate the engineer, and refused to
work. The engineer tried to turn the hot water
hoses on the strikers, but the Arabs had fastened
the valves somehow. Finally the captain went
down to the stoke-hole and drove the Arabs to the
furnaces at the revolver point.
Yet the Tory capitalist of Australia will tell you
of the cheap reliable nigger who thankfully stays
in that position to which it has pleased God to
call him and the British India Steam Navigation
Co. to appoint him. The nigger works for little,
just as the camel drinks little. But give the camel
water every day for a month and he loses his old
ideas of abstinence and wants water every day lor
ever after ; and give the nigger wages as well as
his food and soon he wants more wages, ihe
cheap nigger isn’t cheap, the reliable nigger isn t
reliable. He can do a few things the mediocre
white man can do and the best of him can t do
anything better than the mediocre white man.
28th.— The Red Sea heat is upon us—many of
the passengers, who are supposed to be male, are
comforting themselves with air-pillows and silken
cushions. They seem to be as limp as the Anglo-
Indian women at Colombo, and as childish as if they
still were used to drivel-bibs and spoon meat. A.nd
the way of a man is not to stay pink and soft;
his color should be the redness of Edom and of
Bosrah at birth, and then the ruddy whiteness of
a boy’s life, and so to the mottled strength of
manhood. But the product of an old civilisation,
further weakened by the climate of the East,
seems to be- like no type of man we know in whole-
some Australia.
I found a fine human woman to-day—the wife
of an Army Commissariat man from the French
possessions in the East. He is worn to a
shadow by illness, and his Government paid
a second saloon fare on this ship to Mar-
seilles. They didn’t give his wife a pass, and,
as they couldn’t afford a second-class fare
for her and she refused to stay in the East and
await her husband’s return, she travelled in the
steerage—a shocking place for a woman. If the
positions had been reversed the husband, in most
cases, would have allowed the invalid to go alone,
although he would do anything heroic in her ser-
vice, provided it was sudden. There’s nothing
surprising in women—even the most unexpected
thing—good or bad And you can say that of a
man also.
Was awakened this morning at 3.30 by a hose.
The French boats start washing down decks
about two hours after midnight, and finish some-
where in the neighborhood of 9 a.m. On an Aus-
tralian ship the morning watch wash decks in an
hour or so, but these French crews are luxuriously
slow, and every night I slept on deck the hose
awakened me gently and moistly to enjoy the
heat two or three hours before daybreak.

turies of suddenly recurring high seas, evidently
suggested models to the builders of the Pyramids.
There must have been sharp and shocking storms
here in this funnel-shaped sea to account for
the marvellous weathering of the rocks. You can
see the inspiration of the Bible all along the Gulf
of Suez ; there are thousands of places that might
have been the place of suicide of the Gadarene
swine. You begin to understand in this impetuous
little gulf, that is so easily whipped into fury,
what Job meant (or is it Solomon’s wisdom in the
Apocrypha) by “ seas foaming their own shame.”
A surf-break here brings a suggestion of a drunken
man roaring ou f his secrets in public and giving
himself away. .
On the starboard hand is Mount Sinai, where
Moses built his moral code. The mountains on
the Palestine shore are high, majestic and full of
mystery. Imagine the addition of Arabic and
Coptic color, and you get an idea of what the
moving camp of the Jews in the Peninsula of
Sinai looked like. .
There is a proposal now on foot in England to
deport some thousands of starving London and
Continental Jews to Palestine. But what can
they do there for their support? Even if they
were fit for agricultural or pastoral work—which
they are not, having starved in big cities for
generations—the agricultural and pastoral possi-
bilities of the Promised Land, a part of Arabia
Petraea, by the way, are not very great over a,
large area. If it ever was a land flowing with
milk and honey, the milk was goat’s milk, and
the honey was the honey of wild bees. Why., in
one feast described in the Bible, we are told in a
bated breath that the king had on his table
“butter of kine.” And that is the only place m
the Bible where butter made of cows’ milk is
mentioned. So it must have been a great rarity ;
and if land is not fit for dairying, as we under-
stand it in Australia, it isn’t fit for agriculture,
nor for much else than goat-walks. It is, how-
ever, a good olive and grape-growing country, and
that best describes it. Any man who has seen
the French peasant growing wine-grapes on stones
and heaps of small road metal, knows the
soil of Palestine and knows the. enormous
established competition Palestinian wine-
growers would have to face. The vintage this
year in France is so greatly beyond estimate
that good wine can be bought at the buyer’s price
in many vineyards. And when Australia begins
to make wine in earnest the wine-growing people
of Palestine will find little market for their pro-
duce. But there are 11| millions of Jews on the
earth, and six millions of these are in Russia, and
the horrible poverty of the Jew in Russia must
find any change beneficial. . ~ ,
Yet Palestine is a “land of promise” for the
man hunting for minerals. There are many
petroleum and bitumen deposits, and the phos-
phates of the Dead Sea are said, by a German
engineer who has examined them, to be of good
quality and of almost illimitable extent. There
may be great undiscovered mines in the Holy
Land, and if these starving millions could be
brought out of Europe and into Palestine, even at
the cost to religious tradition of having 100 heads
of stamps working three shifts on the site of the
Temple of Jerusalem, with a 6-inch pump drawing
water from the pool of Siloam, Palestine would
become a more Holy Land than ever it has been.
The French soldiers aboard—some from Noumea,
some from Saigon —seem to be conceited above
the conceit of ordinary men. Each of these
soldiers is armed with a pocket mirror and comb,
which must have cost him half a week’s pay, and
they comb their immature beards and grimace and
attitudinise in their little mirrors for the best part
of the day. But they are honest enough to dis-
play this personal pride of carcase quite publicly.
The anchorage at Suez brought to us a flotilla
manned by Copts, Nubians, Arabs, and -Lurks
dressed in reds and greens and rainbows—their
boats carrying immense leg-of-mutton sails, w e
left Suez at dark and crept along the canal all
night. The canal shores and the surrounding
country—especially near the Bitter Lakes—is very
like the country at the head of the Great Aus-
tralian Bight, between Esperance Bay and base-
man, which is good for neither man nor beast, but
only sandal-wood getters. The outlook s “ ow ®
salt lakes and clay pans, with an occasional Arab
village—dirty, dog-infested, camel-haunted, and
strangely like the Afghan quarters at Coolgardie,
if there were only a glaringly new galvanised-iron
mosque. The only gracious sights were the white
settlements at the canal stations—red, tile-roofed
houses half-hidden by ponciana trees.
We arrived at Port Said before noon, and found
a dirty Eastern Venice with little of the absorb-
ing color of Colombo. The place is inhabited by
thieves, and visited by people who don’t want to
go there. We found chairs in the cool verandah
of a cafe, and had drinks. The German who
served them demanded ss. 6d. “ What! said I,
“ five and sixpence ! You’re a lubber ! All
right, all right,” he replied, “give me two
shillings.” The worst mandolin party on earth
began to perform for us, and all the Incapables of
Port Said came along to do nothing for our amuse-
ment. Nobody hides his light under a bushel
here ; nobody wastes the talent he hasn t got.
A lanky wretch —yellow on the soles of his feet
and lamp-black everywhere else —threw two shock-
ingly bad attempts at handsprings, and demanded
a franc. I refused, but repenting me as he walked
away in great melancholy, and with his filthy
performing-mat in his hands, I threw him
25 cents, and have been ashamed of myself
ever since. By this time I had discovered that
the mandolin party owned the two worst singers
on earth —barring John de Baun and Ignatius, the
horse of Troedel. I left my people to walk about
while I visited the free concert at. the Eldorado,
a concert of loud and strummy music-hall marches,
each note as relevant to the other as human in-
terest is to the themes of Mr. Wagner. Ihe
strings and wood-wind of the Eldorado orchestra
evidently work three shifts.
I drank lager out of a narrow glass nearly two
feet deep—it might have been the glass of the
crow and pitcher fable —and,. not wanting any
more orchestral concert, I paid my shilling and
left. I was half-way down the stairs when the
waiter discovered the shilling to be a half-rupee.
There was much howling and excitement, and the
full strength of the company came down the stairs,
calling loudly for justice. I shall never manage to
get rid of that half-rupee. .'
The chief article of export at Port Said is inde-
cent photographs. ■ . • , .
“ Hey, M’seer,” say the hawkers of dirty photo-
graphs to the man their eagle eyes tell them is a
Frenchman. “ Bon photographe. Anglais .
And to the man who looks Hey,
master ! good photograph, French lady.’
I had been badgered along the street by a score
of Egyptians and Arabs, all wanting me to adopt
them, and when these photo, hawkers came along
I wearied of my retinue as a tired man becomes
angry, and weary also, at being the long sport of
flies. So I turned on them with large, Australian
oaths, and they left me.
Every one of these niggers has a wonderfully
quick eye, and an intuitive knowledge of a
stranger’s nationality and habits. A Frenchman
and myself—neither of us was smoking —passed a
tobacco bazaar, and were hailed by a tobacconist.
“M’seer bon tabac cigareet,” he called to the
Frenchman ; and to me : “ Captain ! Good Cap-
tain ! Strong English tobacco for man’s pipe.
Further on again a beggar whined: “Mseer
donne-moi cinq centimes.” And then to me:
“Gimme penny, Captain ! Me Scotchman, too .
The ship got away from the anchorage before
dusk, leaving a Turk, who did conjuring tricks
with a new-born chicken and an egg, distraught
with anguish because the steamer began to move
before he could collect largesse.
At dinner the worm turned. The worm was a
steward. The French have, as a rule, a sixth
sense—the sense of politeness; but often you meet
at sea Frenchmen priggish enough to insult
stewards and men in m»nial positions—-which is
of all rudeness the most cowardly. At dinner
to-night the hypochondriac, who had, probably,
had an overdose of whisky or pork or strychnine
or all three, cheeked the steward continuously on
the quality of the menu, which was. assuredly not
the steward’s fault. At last said the baited
garcon, “jeboxe a l’Anglais.” The hypochondriac
threw his napkin-ring violently at the bananas and
then collapsed. . . . , . „
What a lot of character there is m a wrist! *ou
can judge by it of the brutalism of a man and the
indelicacy of a woman. Opposite me is a big
Frenchwoman —middle-aged and hard, the kimono
she wears at table exaggerating her masculinity.
Her face is womanly enough—the proof of her
manliness is contained in her short, broad, thick
wrist, like the wrist of a navvy.
For two hours of the two meals of the day a
stolid Mauritius man pulls the punkah ; and,
after the first half hour, the engine beat obsessed
him, and the punkah swayed to the rhythm of the
machinery. Wben, after two hours of the punkah
habit, the machine stopped, the change was almost
the shock a man feels on stepping out of the cage
of a deep shaft into the glaring sunlight.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Andrew Carnegie, who ought to knovf
whether the Open Door or Protection most bene-
fits struggling local industries, puts it this way :
At first, European makers could “ dump their surplus ”
(of steel) upon the American market and force American
makers to accept for their entire output the extremely low
rates which had only to be taken by the invader for a
small part of his. The party in control of a profitable
home market can most successfully invade foreign mar-
kets In recent times it is the American manufacturer
who is “dumping his surplus” in foreign territory.
“ First conquer your home market, and.the foreign
market will probably be added to you,” is the rule with
manufacturers for international trade.
“ A.C.” on Australian freedom :
Australia has ever boasted of freedom of thought and
freedom of speech, hut there is really no such thing m
either Australia or Maoriland. When the S African war
began, many country newspapers tried to place the
then known facts before their readers. In most of
those cases the editors shut up like oysters after
the first issue. A few reached into the second
week’s print, but very, very few went further than
that. In my district two of the four papers were
against the Rhodes gang at the opening of the war They
became Jingoes because it meant bread and butter for
the editors and their families. Had they continued to
denounce Rhodes, Beit, Eckstein and co. their miserable
livin" would have disappeared, and they would have been
hounded out of their towns. At that time no outrages
were too low for the Jingo. One unfortunate newspaper
man, who went to the expense of paying for daily wires
relating to the progress of the war, had his office windows
smashed because he posted up the Magefontem disaster
under the heading of “ Another British Defeat. The
Jin-o mob, headed by an imported bank-manager, after-
wards explained to him that it was not a defeat, only a
reverse, and that he could thank his stars they d.d not
smash his printing plant. Australians say they live in a
.«f ree » country. That is a sorrowful delusion.


De la Rey, according to one of his former
officers, vigorously opposed Kruger and his
policy before the war. When asked whether he
thought the Boers could fight England, he replied,
“No, I do not; and I am equally uncertain
whether England can fight us, because we can
keep on for five years. It will cost England
100, 000 men and £500,000,000.

RELIEF
AT LAST
FROM
The Dreaded piles.
T
HE immediate cause of Piles
may be briefly given as
anything which tends to
irritate or unduly heat the
anus or rectum. Constipation or
diarrohea are equally accountable
for many cases of piles. Now
Bile Beans for Biliousness
do not treat the complaint locally,
but they go to the fountain head
with a result that in their search
through the system they bring
about regular and healthy actions. Half
the battle is over then ; but Bile Beans for Biliousness do more. In that particular search
mentioned they visit the liver, and, succeeding in putting it in its proper working order, are
the means of infusing new and rich blood into the system, and, as a result, bodily strength
follows. Under such circumstances it is impossible for Piles to exist.
Mr. WILSON', of Albury, N.S.W., gives the following convincing testimony: “ I take this opportunity
of informing you of the benefit I have derived by using your well-known medicine. For about ten years I
suffered untold agony from Piles, sometimes losing two or three weeks’ work at a time. I spent pounds
upon pounds for doctors’ treatment. They all advised me to have them cut out, but I could not accept the
idea of being operated upon. One of my children picked up one of your pamphlets which I carefully read,
and then I got a box, tried them, and felt great benefit. I continued with a couple of boxes, arid I am
thankful to say lam now a different man. I keep them in the house, occasionally taking a couple, which
keep me all right. I always take pleasure in recommending them to fellows sufferers, and I can safely say
there is no medicine like Bile Beans for Piles.”
BILE BEANS cure biliousness, headache, Indigestion, debility, female ailments, liver trouble,
oostiveness, piles, bad blood, pimples, and all skin eruptions, and as a preventative of coughs,
colds, and influenza they are unequalled. Obtainable at all chemists, Price 13£d. per box, or
direct from the Australian Depot, 39 Pitt-street, Sydney. Be sure you get the genuine

Witchery’s Ride: A Fragment.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“May I try him?” asked Witchery, pleading
with eyes
That were truer than Truth and as blue as the
skies;
For eyes such as these, when they glisten and
plead,
There is only one answer; I brought her the steed.
For a moment her foot, like a little brown bird,
Lay at rest in my hand—then it fluttered and
stirred,
And she smiled in my face over Pegasus’ mane
As she gracefully gathered the whip and the rein.
Then old Pegasus wheeled, took the rails in his
stride,
And landed light-footed on Fairyland side.
And I watched them sweep down through the
bars of the moon
To the pathway that leads to the lotos lagoon;
And I turned to the world, to its labor and play,
As the footfall in distance died softly away.
* * * *
Hark ! The musical whisper of hoofs on the
track !
And a silvery “ Cooee ! ” ’Tis Witchery back !
And old Pegasus, stumbling, goes short in his
stride—
There is foam on his shoulder and sweat on his
side.
When I took her white hand she made never a
sign,
And I looked in her eyes, a sad question in mine.
“Ah ! Yes ! It is beautiful! ” Witchery said,
“And beside it our world seems a world of the
dead ;
“ For the fern leaves of Fancy grow there by the
moon,
And sad was I, sweetheart, to leave it so soon !
“Do they always come trooping—your Fairyland
folk—
With their lotos and lilies your pathway to cloak ?
“And old Pegasus!—tell me—does always he clear
The dark shadows with you as he did with me,
dear ? ”
“Ah ! No ! ” said I. “Witchery ! I, when I ride,
Find the shadows lie under-me deeply and wide ;
‘ And they gather and chain us with chains as
we go,
Till the light feet grow heavy, the swift become
slow,
“ Until sometimes I think I shall never ride back
To the lotos moon-meadows down Fairyland
Track.”
WILL OGILVIE.
The Bull-ants.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We had finished the meal of chops and damper.
Peace filled our souls, and we filled our pipes.
Bill Taylor lit his pipe and took off his boots.
Then he stretched himself at full length, and upset
the billy of hot water on to his unprotected feet.
It took Bill some time to find words appropriate
to the occasion ; which said, he turned his atten-
tion to a bull-ant that had fastened on his ankle
when he removed his socks.
Having dispersed the ant, he felt better, and
returned to moderate English ; but the iron had
entered his soul, and the conversation took a
pessimistic turn.
He remarked that whereas, from time immem-
morial, ants had been held up as examples to
grasshoppers, crickets and sluggards, ant-life was
the rottenest system on earth, and the ant the
most culpably foolish of all God’s creatures. Inci-
dentally, Bill said that if you cut a bull-ant in two,
one part will remain to do battle while the other
runs off for help.
He made a practical demonstration of his theory,
but, as it didn’t work, he spitefully drove a crust
into the ant-hole, effectually stopping it up.
Then he distributed some crumbs, and awaited
developments.
Every ant in the immediate neighborhood
snatched a crumb and made for the hole. Then
there was a row !
The first ant dropped his crumb and mounted
the crust. Others coming up dragged him off,
and accused him of putting the crust there.
He protested his innocence, but was thrown
out, and a council was held. A big ant took the
floor, and waved his antennae passionately as he
exhorted his audience to rescue their brethren
entombed in the mine beneath.
They attacked the crust furiously, but they
might as well have tried to shift a boulder. Then
they tore little pieces off it, but that took too
long, and every moment was precious. So they
held another council, and it was decided to under-
mine the obstruction, for, without doubt, those
entombed were working that way.
How they went at it ! Presently a little earth
dropped through, then a head appeared, and an
ant ran out, followed by a long, angry stream that
soon blackened a space around the hole.
The rescuers fought bravely, but they were out-
numbered by twenty to one, and their cox-pses
littered the ground piecemeal.
It was then I noticed that the cloud had gone
from the high forehead of Mr. Taylor, and he
even prophesied that to-morrow would be a fine
day.
C.N.
Australians are always hearing that at
’Ome you don’t find the same corruption in poli-
tics as in Australia and America. Some facts
about the British war-horse contracts : £250,000
has disappeared altogether—simply can’t be
found ; one person obtained a contract from the
War Office to supply 3000 horses at £33 16s. Bd. a
head, and at once sublet for £22 a head, whereby
he pocketed rather over £35,000 on that one deal ;
to one shipping firm £lB a head was paid for the
carriage of army horses, whilst the rate for pri-
vate horses on the same route was £8 a head. And
th j British Govt, absolutely refuses to appoint a
It jyal Commission to find out who has pocketed
’•no boodle !
Johnson’s Goal.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The roads lay ankle-deep in mud and slush.
Johnson plodded on through stuff the consistency
of porridge with his dray-load of firewood, and
pondered with all the might of the material God
had given him to ponder with. The goal, by any
mental track, always remained the same—suicide.
Johnson was a village settler, the generality of
which class are the failures in every other walk of
life, thrown by a fostering Government on to the
primal resource —the land. From the land you
extract the scantiest reward for the greatest
amount of toil, and if you are imbecile, or only a
couple of doors removed, you get on your knees,
clasp your horny hands, and give thanks. John-
son was further off than that by a street, so he
was contemplating suicide with some negative
cheerfulness.
He remembered a comparatively young man
(the skin of his face felt puckered now in com-
parison) who twelve years ago uncomplainingly
tackled the task set by Fate. He had 50 acres—
an unusually large grant —and he meant business.
Physically fit for any amount of toil and any call
for endurance, he rooted out the tenth part of the
timber that stocked his land, burned it and
ploughed ujp the lot for the first year. Neighbors
pointed to him as an example of untiring indus-
try ; some gazed open-mouthed at the almost
supernatural intelligence he displayed when con-
versing on the prospects. Others, long buffeted
by life-storms, hopelessly-cynical, chronically-
tired, said “Wait! ”
Proceeds of first year paid the Government’s
fraction and raised an extra horse. Johnson
yanked out another tenth of the timber, and on
the strength of the lot fell in love with Sally
Thomas, a neighbor’s daughter. Their farm ad-
joined Johnson’s. Sally was “no slouch ”at out-
side work —could milk, use an axe, harness a
horse, load hay, and fit herself generally to any of
the exigencies of village-settling. She was also
no beauty, but young—and a female. That was
enough for Johnson.
Year 2 by the settlement calendar blew the
light out. Drought withered up the crop, and a
bush-fire in its wake completed the ruin. His new
horse died, and Johnson spent six weeks under a
doctor’s care. “Nothing radically wrong; sys-
tem out of gear,” said the sawbones. “ Why don’t
you get married ? ” He had his question answered
satisfactorily when he sent in his bill.
Years 3,4, 5, and 6 went by, and still the
position had not materially improved. Slaving
night and day alone, amid fearful monotony,
seemed to have knocked the heart out of Johnson,
but he pegged away mechanically, going his
rounds like a whim-horse, and fortune smiled at
last—a little. She doesn’t smile very loudly on
village settlers.
To-day he was in a position to get married. He
had paid off his debts at the local store, squared
the doctor, and had £2O in his pocket, wherewith
furniture and other necessaries might be pur-
chased. But he felt old, somehow—and doubtful
—and Sal —he didn’t like to think of her as she
appeared to him that morning. What a change
12 years had made ! There was no get-out of it.
She had waited for him. A dry, withered hag
now, with a man’s hat on, she offered no suggestion
of sex. Johnson knew what he wanted—David of
old could afford it—but—the settler passed his
rough hand over his toil-worn face—and felt the
wrinkles. —Bah !
And for this he had worked—and now that he saw
the accomplishment of his desire ahead there was
no joy in the thought of it —and no escape from
the doing of it. Well! well ! and his head sank
lower on his breast as the horse splashed away
methodically down the home road.
They found him hanging from the beam of the
hut next day. Sal’s xong-delayed ring lay on
the rough slab table. Coroner's jury said “Un-
sound mind.” But it wasn’t compelled to marry
Sal!
L.M.D.
His Martyrdom.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He was about 30, handsome, but miserable and
worried-looking. She was tall, scraggy and 45,
and obviously owned him and gloried in the fact.
She took her seat in the stalls with much rustle
and fuss, and talked loudly.
“ I can’t see at all, dearest; let me change seats
with you. Thank you, pet; and, oh, Charley
love, you forgot the lollies.”
He departed with alacrity to get some, and she
impatiently fanned herself and watched for his
return.
“Dearest, how long you have been !” (reproach-
fully). He writhed under the look of amusement
on the faces of those around.
‘ ‘ What are we going to have to-night, love, do
you know ? ”
“I don’t, Martha.”
“Martha?” (tenderly). “Why not ‘Mattie
darling,’ as usual, love ? ”
“ S-sh.”
“Why, pet? The lights haven’t gone down
yet.”
“ Don’t talk so loud ! ” (desperately).
“ Oh, my poor, dear boy ! Have you a head-
ache to-night, darling ? ”
“ No, no ! I’m all right,” and he buried himself
in his programme, to avoid meeting the eyes of
the two pretty girls in front. Then the lights
went down, and a soft darkness mercifully hid his
embarrassment from view, but it couldn’t hide the
tender whispers.
“ Wasn’t that good, dearest —clap that hard for
me, love ! Charley, love ! ”
“What?”
“Let me call at ma’s on our road home; she
would be so pleased ; wouldn’t she, darling ? ”
“Very,” he grunted.
He helped her on with her cloak, which was a
very exacting performance, and was lovingly
loaded with her fan, lolly-box, smelling-salts,
opera-glass, programme, etc.
“Well, what did you think of it, sweetheart?”
she said out loud over her shoulder as he meekly
followed her down the staircase.
