The RED PAGE
A Tuneful Quire
Gosse
Edmund Gosse, with six volumes of verses
to his name, proclaims himself a tired man
in his seventh. The Autumn Garden
(Hemeinann) contains slight verses
chiefly about flowers, with here
and there a passing phase of philosophy.
He writes with all the minor’s accuracy,
saying with precision little things that need
not be said. He writes verse simply because
it is the custom of English critics to write
occasional verse. It is a genteel occupation,
not to be taken too seriously. Yet here is
a pleasing impression of “ A London Fog ” :
In blue-gray fog, as in a sea, we drown ;
The unseen rain soaks down;
Like broken phantom pillars, from each roof
The chimneys soar aloof.
The sky, lost, like some ocean from below.
Melts in one general flow ;
Vague, dull, immense, splashed with the light of
tears,
The long dim pavement sheers.
And now, and now, across its sullied glass,
The blotted figures pass ;
Hope, poverty, ambition, lust, and pain
Glide, muffled, through the rain.
And she whom most we love, or that fell head
Our thoughts hate most, and dread,
Might cleave the blueness at our cheek, nor make
One sentry-nerve awake.
And his “Epilogue” is interesting less for
its poetry than for its fine personal outlook.
Grosse is a critic who does not think all the
poets are dead. He admits that probably
he, in his old age, will fail to understand
the newer poets, but still he will preserve
his faith in beauty.
Before my tale of days is told,
O may I watch, on reverent knees,
The unknown Beauty once unfold
The magic of her mysteries !
Before I die, O may I see.
Clasped in her violet girdle, Spring ;
May April breezes blow to me
Songs that the youngest poets sing ! ..,
New arts, new raptures, new desires
Will stir the new-born souls 6f men;
New fingers smite new-fashioned lyres—
And O ! may Ibe listening then. .. .
Change is the pulse of life on earth,
The artist dies, but Art lives on ;
New rhapsodies are ripe for birth
When every rhapsodist seems gone. ...
Nay, humbly, shrinkingly, in dread
Of fires too splendid to be borne—
In expectation lest my head
Be from its Orphic shoulders torn—
I wait till, down the eastern sky,
Muses, like Msenads in a throng,
Sweep my decayed traditions by,
In startling tones of unknown song.
So, to my days’ extremity,
May I, in patience infinite,
Attend the beauty that must be,
And, though it slay me, welcome it.
Benson
The Poems of A. G. Benson { John Lane)
consists of a selection from six previous
volumes, and betrays the same stodginess as
his quick-coming prose. Many of
his lyrics also are addressed to
flowers ; while others favor the toad, mole,
newt and similar fauna in a reverent Words-
worthian manner reminiscent of the “Lines
written with a Slate Pencil on a Stone, the
largest of the heap, after finding a Young
Tadpole while Walking with a friend on a
Wet Day.” In his “ Prelude,” Benson says
that at the temple gate :
Victim or minister
I dare not claim to be,
But in the concourse and the stir,
There shall be room for me.
Apparently there is room in England for one
who writes deftly on familiar themes, who
utters platitudes with portentous solemnity,
and whose polysyllabic murmur is full of
echoes : “the immemorial sea,” “the multi-
tudinous roar,” “reverberant wings,” and
“ shut of evening,” “ nipping, eager
weather,” etc. In the sonnet’s scanty plot
Benson’s culture produces fair results ; but
the only lyric with any force in it is “ Stand
Aside,” which is a variation of Browning's
“Lost Leader,” and is as mild as cold tea
compared with Swinburne’s “ Clear the
Way.”, He modestly admits that he cannot
sihg as sings the nightingale, thrush or owl :
But I can sing as sings the prudent bee,
As hour by patient hour he goes and conies,
Bearing the golden dust from tree to tree,
Labors in hope, and as be labors, hums.
Humming may be filled with sweet airs in
bee-land, but in mortal verse it is apt to be
monotonous.
Griffyth
Fairfax
J. Griffyth Fairfax proved in The Gates of
Sleep that he possessed a respectable lyrical
faculty. His volume of Poems (Smith, Elder
and Co.) contains work much in
advance of the earlier booklet.
He writes with ease and grace,
and has little to learn on the technical side.
Unfortunately he has not anything new to
say, and does not say the old things freshly.
Even if the quotations which adorn many of
the poems did not suggest it, the poems
themselves show that they are begotten of
books. Familiar fauns and satyrs, naiads
and dryads, Maenads and Bassarids flit
through his pages, and there is hardly an
original image, phrase, or mode of expres-
sion. Milton may not have any monopoly
of “the opening eyelids of the morn,”
but Fairfax, who also uses “the opening
eyelids,” gives us in addition “the eyelids of
the sky ” and “eyelids of the day.” “ The
Wind with amorous fingers ” turns over a
few pages to “ the slow dawn, whose pallid
fingers ” in their turn point to “ the gray
pale fingers of the wistful day.” “ Ariadne
in Naxos ” is a pleasant piece of blank verse,
and there are other things well done : but
somehow the silhouette frontispiece, by
Baron Cedercreutz, of windmills and their
reflection in the stream is symbolical of the
whole of Fairfax’s verse.
Arnold
Wall
Arnold Wall, a professor in Maoriland,
has a distinctive note although it is a low
one. His New Poems (Walter Scott Co.)
contain some characteristic blank
verse, but is more varied in style
than his first volume. The pro-
fessor’s place in the quire is that of “an
unobtrusive floating undertone ” (to quote
one of his own lines). It is intellectual rather
than emotional verse, quiet and precise in
style, but occasionally it bubbles with a little
playful humor. An experiment in “ Head-
Rimes ” is interesting :
Here in our shot-silk harbor rimmed with hills
Dear to the souls of men who marry yachts.
Bask little bays where truant breezes come,
Asking no leave of him who rules the winds ;
They quit th’ advancing column, brisk deserters.
Lay themselves down, sleep lightly, rise and
stretch,
Curl round the sides of the bay, look out to sea,
Whirl one another round in curious dances.
So with your beautiful face, my daily study—
No words can paint it, handled honestly.
Some of the poems are reprinted from The
Bulletin and The Lone Hand.
Psychic Fiction
PSYCHIC phenomena are fashion-
able in novels now-a-days. It does
not require a great deal of study
to get up a certain amount of “local
color,” but not many of the novelists have
visited the region itself, and they fail to
produce any really creepy weirdness.
Some of Stevenson’s short stories are the
best of the kind, and Henry James
achieves gruesome thrills in The Two
Magics. Charles Marriott’s The Happy
Medium and Other Stories {per Sydney
Book Club) includes one or two ventures
into the eerie, but most of the stories are
clever studies of domestic relationships,
with one amusing yarn in which a golli-
wog takes an active part in the punish-
ment of a foolish husband.
Algernon Blackwood’s John Silence
(Dymock’s Library), the adventures of a
psychic Sherlock Holmes, breaks new
ground and succeeds in realising an
other-worldly atmosphere. The • first
“ case ”is a particularly good one. A
writer of humorous stories resorts to a
powerful drug which lays him open to an
invasion by evil forces inhabiting his
house, stored there by a long-gone tenant
of atrocious character. The effect is that
his sense of humor is obliterated, his
rest is destroyed, and he becomes clair-
voyant. He hears sights and sees
sounds. Perhaps the invaded humorist
had read Arthur Rimbaud’s sonnet on
the colors of the vowels : anyhow, he
heard the red bindings of the books in
deep sounds, the yellow covers made
a shrill piercing note, the brown book-
case muttered, and the green curtains
kept up a rippling sound like the
lower notes of a wood-horn. But that
was the least of the troubles from which
Dr. Silence relieved him by removing him
to another house and meeting the ghostly
forces himself. The book is worth read-
ing.
Blackwood’s latest production, Jinibo:
a Fantasy (McMillan), is of a different
and more difficult order, for he attempts
in detail and on a larger scale what Kip-
ling merely suggested in “ They.” An
imaginative boy, who is full brother to
the happy muffin-seller in The Golden Age,
and first cousin to Canton’s W.V., peoples
a neighboring empty house with his
own cheerful creations. A practical
governess, acting under instructions from
a matter-of-fact father to knock the boy’s
silly notions out of his head, terrifies him
by putting an imaginary Monster into
the Empty House. Shortly afterwards
the boy is injured, and in the period of
unconsciousness his subliminal-self ex-
perienced many strange adventures in
the Empty House with its master, Bright,
and subsequently learns how to escape
back to the body by flight. It is a re-
markable fantasy, and could have been
written only by one who has keen
intuitions and intense sympathy with
children.
A Sociological Novel
A Man of Property and The Country House
gave the name of John Galsworthy a special
significance to fiction readers as that of an
artist in fiction to whom social problems had
not become the incubus of “a purpose,”
but were something more than a back-
ground. Fraternity {per Roycroft Library)
is the story of a couple of middle-
class families in London, cultured, refined
and fairly well-to-do, beginning at the time
when a group belonging to the lower-class
impinged upon them and caused grave dis-
turbance in their usually serene and scented
lives. Two brothers Dallison had married
two sisters, daughters of a famous scientist,
who was mentally deranged by an illness,
became detached from current life and
devoted himself with fanatical zeal to the
writing of a great book on Universal
Brotherhood. Throughout the story the
eccentric old idealist moves in and out,
like a Greek chorus, uttering oracu-
lar passages from his Book of Universal
Brotherhood. One of his remarks, that
“ each of us has a shadow in those streets ”
(of the slums) is the keynote of Fraternity.
Hilary Dallison, a novelist, is a sensi-
tive negative person, estranged from his wife,
who occupies herself with painting. Her
model is the principal agent in creating the
disturbances which make the story—primarily
by awakening “the social conscience” in the
artist’s husband, and finally by arousing the
latent animalism in his attenuated blood.
The other Dallison, a sardonic lawyer,
refuses to interfere with “the shadows,” in
whom liis wife is sentimentally interested —
“ It’s all very well up to a certain point, and
nobody sympathises with them more than I
do ; but after that it becomes destructive of
all comfort, and that does no good to anyone,”
Apparently Galsworthy wishes to show the
effect of the social conscience working
in the class represented by the Dallisons.
The sense of smell, according to the
author, is responsible for the im-
penetrable barrier between the classes.
The lawyer’s daughter, in whom the social
conscience had developed rapidly under the
influence of a male cousin, an uncompromis-
ing socialist and sanitationist, finds the
effect of the slums on her senses too much
for her philanthropy, and retreats in dismay.
The novel writer, just at the point where he
was becoming human in his relations with
the model, is driven back by his offended
nose.
The narrative is without a hero or heroine,
and without any definite plot. There is
much gentle irony in it, sometimes wrapped
in quaint symbols, such as “the perfect
dog,” made of sterilised wool, which was
discovered by Hilary’s lady-poodle. It is
written with great charm, but as a novel it is
vague and inconclusive. While the. theorist
on Universal Brotherhood is in the clouds,
the practical sanitationist becomes so
inhuman that he cannot kiss a pretty girl
who loves him —because she funked at
slumming. The author’s sympathy with
“ the shadows ” is evident, but the pictures
of the two classes have no coherency except
in so far as they show the essential fraternity
of both—which is a truism hardly requiring
elaborate statement.
A German-Silvery Discourse
The dialogue form looks easy, but is
extremely difficult; and Homer, Plato
and the rest of the ancients, being dead,
cannot protest if their shades are used by
a modern for the purpose of “ throwing
off” at his enemies or mankind in general.
Landor employed them and many living
persons in his incomparable Imaginary
Conversations, where they interpret them-
selves afresh and incidentally ventilate
Landor’s own views on various questions.
The dry radiance of the Conversations
comes from a more truly Greek spirit and a
greater mastery of English prose than is
to be found anywhere else in his time,
and he lived to be over eighty. Landor
has been unduly neglected, but it is
worthy of note that Nietzsche, in The
Gay Science, regards him as the only
Englishman of last century who could be
ranked as a master of prose.
There have been many Dialogues of
the Dead since Landor’s, and perhaps
the best of them were those in J. K.
Bangs’ light and airy House Boat on the
Styx. More serious efforts, such as the
late Marion Crawford’s With the Im-
mortals, have not been quite successful.
Dr. Emil Reich, a writer on Plato,
modern history and a multitude of other
things, indulges in a little relaxation in
some dialogues called Nights with
the Gods (T. Werner Laurie), which
is something like an attempt to
cross Landor with J. K. Bangs. The
immortals discuss affairs of to-day with
most elephantine efforts to be funny.
Vociferous and inextinguishable laughter
is stated to have followed their ponderous
sallies, which gives one a poor opinion of
the sense of humor possessed by Dr.
Reich’s gods. There is, however, some
shrewd criticism to reward the reader
who survives the bad puns. Diogeries on
Bernard Shaw is worth listening to, and
Caesar’s comment on a House of Com-
mons debate ends with this pronounce-
ment :
“The truth is that no nation makes itself.
It is made by itself only in so far as it reacts
against the powerful influence of others. If
these are feeble and second-rate, the reacting
nation itself will remain feeble and second-
rate. . . The English ought to welcome,
although co combat the rise of Germany.
They imagine that their principal force
comes from their colonies. It will come not
from their colonies, which is geographically
impossible, but from their perennial rivalry
with great Continental Powers. These
rivalries made England, made her colonies.
To give up these rivalries, to cease combating
great Continental Powers, will be the end
both of England and her Empire.”
Willis—and Crick
W. N. Willisjias written something which
he calls The Life of W. P. Crick. It
might have been more appropriately called
“ Memoirs of Willis, with Some Remarks
About Crick and Others.” As a literary
performance it is about as bad as it could
be. The style is tawdry, there is no order or
arrangement, and there is much tedious
repetition. It is stuffed with old anecdotes,
which are mostly spoilt in the re-telling ;
but shining here and there are poetical
extracts like diamonds stuck in mud. If it
is permissible for the Devil to quote Scrip-
ture, certainly Mr. Willis can quote Shakes-
peare, and he does so frequently and with
unction. But he does not do Crick’s
memory much good service*
The story of Crick’s life might conceivably
be written with advantage ,but if done at all,
it would be better if it were done some time
hence, when the heat and dust raised by the
recent land troubles had subsided, and the
man, W. P. Crick, could be seen in truer
perspective. And Crick, with all his faults,
was very much a man, courageous and gener-
ous, a good hater and a better friend. He
was remarkable for an abnormal develop-
ment of intellect in a nature which otherwise
remained primitive. He was an able lawyer
with a touch of the pugilist ; an astute
politician with a dash of the larrikin.
Civilisation has wrapped all the important
acts of life in elaborate ceremonial, and
fighting has its recognised rules ; but if a
young barbarian like Napoleon enters the
field and makes straight for his object when
he ought to be in winter quarters, the
highly-cultivated enemy is disconcerted and
weakened before the fight begins. In some-
what the same way Crick entered into party
warfare. He had unlimited pluck, no respect
for authority, and a hatred of ceremonial.
He acted on the ancient maxim—“Bold,
always bold ! ” —and the directness of his
methods soon made him feared as “ a first-
class fighting man.” As he grew older he
learned to respect the conventions ; but the
primitive instincts were often too strong for
him—otherwise his intellect might have
carried him to a very high place as a public
man.

A WONDERFUL CURE
FOR INDIGESTION
REDFERN TESTIMONY.
“Each morning I woke with the consciousness
that something was not right,” remarked Mr.
William Johnston, of No. 127 Eveleigh Street,
Redfern, to a newspaper representative, who was
making some enquiries. Continuing he said :“I
felt as if I was in for a spell of sickness, and, sure
enough, those misgivings foretold what afterwards
happened. You see, the heat was pretty consider-
able where I was, up at Mole, seventy miles from
Warren, 115 deg. in the shade for a week at a
stretch'being regarded as only a fleabite to what
could happen when the sun was in good form, and
too much of that sort of business gets on a man’s
nerves, and runs him down a bit, I tell you, and
I think I ought to know.”
“Of course, because you are speaking from ex-
perience,” interrupted the scribe.
‘ ‘ Exactly. There were a good few of us working
at an artesian bore, which ejected soda water—
without. I need scarcely remark, any whisky in it
—and too much soda straight is not good. In-
deed, it proved very bad for us, and as we never
got within reach of anything in the way of vege-
tables, it is only to be expected that the conse-
quences were very bad for the blood. Mine, like
the rest, was in a terrible state, sores breaking out
in all directions, and the flies were so troublesome
that we had to go away and sit ig the dark to get
a little peace. The remedies I tried to put myself
in order with were of no avail, and my sufferings
became unbearable. When I sat down to a meal
I would get half way through when an attack of
retching always occurred, so no wonder my strength
fell off like it did. I became as weak as a kitten,
and, the work being laborious, 1 could not keep
going. Matters were about at their worst, when
the overseer went over ,to Bourke, and returned
with some Clements Tonic for the men, and I give
you my word as an honorable man, that after I had
taken but one bottle I felt a different being en-
tirely. The headaohes that I had beforehand
were enough to destroy one’s happiness, without
anything else ; but, besides, I had most of those
wretched symptoms which usually accompany in-
digestion. To begin with, my chest felt quite
clogged up, as though I had swallowed a lump of
was c^o &B'i n g the breathing piassages
and about my loins. I felt as if I had been beaten
with a stick sore and aching. Again, under the
blades of my shoulders there were shap, pricking
sensations as if a needle were at work, and m
audition to all else, there was a perpetual feeling
of wearmess as if I had run myself to death.
When getting out of bed of a morning, I would
have to hold on to it to steady myself, the dizzi-
ness being so great that I would have overbalanced,
and all the time I was going down-hill fast. My
weight was disappearing in a most alarming man-
ner, and I dread to think of what would have
happened had not Clements Tonic made its timely
appearance, through the kindness of our overseer. ”
Me had probably used it himself on some pre-
vious occasion ? ” hazarded the writer.
. .“Hesaid so, and swore by it. Thereisnomed-
icine in the world to equal Clements Tonic, he
used to say, and, my word, he was right, for it
fixed us up splendidly. Its purifving effects on
my blood cannot be too highly spoken of. Enough
to say that the sores soon disappeared, after which
I rested better. I began to eat more freely and
regularly under Clements Tonic’s influence, and
the retching after meals became a thing of the
past. And if Clements Tonic cannot cure indi-
gestion quicker than anything else, I’m a Dutch-
man. It put me right out of touch with each
symptom belonging to that complaint in no time:
then it added to its wonderful work by steadying
my nerves, and giving me as much strength as a
mail could wish for. Whenever I meet a person,
either man or woman, suffering in any particular
bke i did myself, I just tell them what I know
Clements Tonic can do, as in my case, and if they
c l° n Ro find get a bottle or two of that remedy,
then all I can say is, they deserve to suffer. Pub-
lish this any way you please.”

“My daughter Ruby, 7 years,
was completely run down
through weakness and bron-
chitis, and the doctor advised
me to give her SCOTT’S
DOCTOR
Emulsion,
saying that it
was splendid
for building up the constitu-
tion. She liked SCOTT’S
and in a short time became
quite well and rosy; appetite
improved and she put on flesh
wonderfully.” (Mrs.) Agnes
Jarrett, il2 Buckingham
ORDERED
Street, Syd-
ney, N.S.W.,
1/9/08. The
doctor ordered SCOTT’S in
preference to any other emul-
sion because doctors know
that SCOTT’S Emulsion
always contains precisely the
same quantities of precisely
the same pure and powerful
SCOTT’S
ingredients,
manufactured
into a deli-
cious cream by the unchal-
lenged SCOTT process.
From this it follows that
diseases and conditions which
SCOTT’S has been proved
to cure (as above) will be
cured just as surely in other
EMULSION
cases, your
own child’s
for instance.

WHEN THE WIND BLOWS
from three or four directions at the same'
time it is quite natural to expect coughs
and colds—these should not be left to run
their course, but should be treated promptly
by taking
BONNINCTON’S
Irish Moss.
This splendid remedy acts like a charm
and will cure the most persistent cough
or cold.
The cost is so small that it is foolish to endanger your lungs and
perhaps your life by allowing a cold to run on.

The Pickle-Beauties’ Dance.
Staider hearts than mine would frown
On the sins of Pickle Town ;
Buckland-street and all its crew
Gulp a lot of mischief down.
Ye that lodge with Bacchus know
How the stacks of empties grow.
Belies of a hundred feasts
Once I gave a Bottle-Oh.
“ Yous er bonser bloke,” said he,
And straightway invited me
To “ Ther Pickle-Beauties’ Darnce—
Chewsday, ’All ov ’Armenee.
“ Don’tcher wear yer Percy clo’es,
Bet yer life ther Beauties knows
When er toff’s a-quizz’n’ ’em ! ”
Strange the ways of Bottle-Ohs !
“ Arst fer Plugger Bill—thet’s me ! ”...
’Mid the sounds of revelry
I was frankly introduced
Into Push Society.
In an atmosphere that swore
Fifty cobbers held the floor,
Eife-and-concertina band
Sweated beer from every pore.
Gowned in velveteen and fur,
Never maid looked comelier
Than the Pride of Pickle Town ;
I was introduced to her.
She was proper style and class ;
You could see the bits of glass
Glinting in her finger-rings,
And her bangles were of brass.
As we waltzed, a tragic youth,
In a manner moat uncouth,
Chewing cigarettes and beer.
Snarled across his one front tooth.
’Tween the dances on the stair,
Sitting out to get the air,
Once I kissed her silent lips
When it seemed no one was there.
Then she slapped my face and cried,
“Chuck it, mister, you’ve er nide ! ”
’Twas a wild anaemic youth,
Choked with frenzy at my side !
Oh, ye Lord of Stoush ! —a Thug
Swore he’d “ wipe me cross ther lug !”
“ Shut yer ’ead,” growled Bottle-Oil;
“ Me ’n’ ’im ’r’ pals, yer mug ! ”
Beauty smiled and said, “ This gent
Is me friend,” so argument
Ceased, and with the dance renewed
I was very well content.
And, lest there should be regrets,
Shouted beer and cigarettes.
The attenuated youth
Mouthed the quaintest epithets.
Harmony came after storm ;
It was blissful on the form
While the push swopped drinks and danced ;
Things were getting pretty warm,
When said she, “ I’m goin’ ’ome ! ’’ —
Smoothed her hair and fixed her comb. . . .
Never were two lips so sweet
Underneath the starry dome !
Youth is rash and Folly blind,
As immortal gods designed :
With an arm around my neck
How should I have looked behind ?
I was wakened by the crash
Of blue metal through the sash. . . .
’Twas a scared, anaemic youth
Took the palings at a dash.
N.s.w.
W. M. WHITNEY.
Unarmed: A Song of the Last Stand.
The North Sea holds our ships of war, and most
of the Empire’s men,
And the Empire’s batteries groan and roar, for
the Lion has left his den.
The rousing smell of the gun-gas drifts to a nation
about to die;
And, as the smoke of the battle lifts, we see our
foes draw nigh.
Our foes? Yes, we are about to snuff in the breeze
of the Mongol’s curse !
We’re doomed to death, and that’s bad enough—
but our women are doomed to worse !
So pass me my brick and my butcher’s knife, and
let me away to the fight,
And dear, indeed, will I sell my life* with my
bare steel gleaming bright!
The withering grass and the fading flower and the
clover the fat cow chews,
Like this we are—of a passing hour ; we’ll melt
like the morning dews !
But, ere the Mongol grabs my beer, and my good
blood reds the ground.
By the grace of my Brunswick brick I’ll smear a
splash of his gore around !
Ere yet the Mongol mounts my stair and seizes
the furniture,
Some of him shall lie stiffened where my blood
goes down the sewer !
So pass me my blade from the meatman’s block
and my brick, Australian made,
And when I’ve scattered my last, lorn rock, I’ll
face death, unafraid.
Oh, Ethel May shall wail and weep and worry her
golden hair,
And those who then our borders keep shall stare
at her, sitting there !
And though she smile on the foe, or shrink, her
future will be the same—
In heathen hovels she’ll shortly sink to the slave-
girl’s crawling shame.
So pass me out my final feed—the Mongol is
almost due.
Give me, in haste, the things I need—my sticks
and stones, my new.
Sharp axe wherewith, when death is near, to make
my final stand ;
And, for our poor, brave women—here, the
cyanide-draught’s at hand !
VICTORIA.

Correspondents to Tim Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor. Bulletin.” is the proper
superscription for “copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

return of MS. cannot receive attention. The Bulletin

ANOTHER BREAKDOWN IN VIEW.
It becomes increasingly evident that the Fisher
Government stands on a precarious foundation,
and —bar accidents —its days seem to be numbered.
Alfred Deakin, who used to rather despise
office, seems to grow hungrier for it with in-
creasing years, and the question of presenting
Britain with a Dreadnought will probably furnish
the excuse for another shuffle of the political
cards. Deakin, despite liis disastrous coalitions
of the past, could not join with that soured Tory
and traitor Joseph Cook on matters of ordinary
policy, even to compass Fisher’s downfall. But
the Dreadnought craze, or flicker, or whatever it
may be called, is a sort of neutral subject on
which a momentary Cook-Deakin alliance is
possible. True, there is no special reason to
imagine that Britain specially wants to receive a
Dreadnought—it isn’t polite to look a gift ship in
the mouth ; but, all the same, it is practically
certain that Britain would much rather that
Australia took on the steady job of defending its
end'of the Empire in a regular way than that it
should hysterically give its aged parent one un-
manned ship, without any fund to cover repairs
and ultimate replacement, and then give three
cheers for itself and go to sleep. And it isn’t at
all certain that Australia wants to give that ship,
though there is certainly a dribble of subscrip-
tions, partly from title-hunters, partly from
people who regard the gift of a solitary vessel as
an excuse for shirking the much larger matter of
general naval defence, and partly from other
people. Further, neither Cook nor Deakin ex-
plains where the money is to come from to liqui-
date this sudden spasm, for the money will evi-
dently be wanted at short notice. Cook is
against Fisher’s proposed progressive land-tax ;
Deakin alleges that the revenue to be obtained
from the land-tax won’t arrive in time to save
Fisher from a deficit, even if he doesn’t go Dread-
noughting. And neither Cook nor Fisher dares
to openly suggest that we should borrow money
from Old Mother at “ Home ” in order to pay for
Old Mother’s own ship. If they temporarily com-
bine to throw out Fisher on the Dreadnought
question, then they will presumably separate
again, for, except on this one matter, union seems
impossible. That will mean one of two things:
Either (1) Cook, .with a minority Government,
will be struggling to find cash to pay the cost of a
sudden and unprovided-for ironclad while he will
be faced by a hostile majority, part of which,
under Deakin, will declare that he is getting the
money the wrong way, while the other part,
under Fisher, will declare that he shouldn’t get
it at all; or (2) Deakin will be in a similar pre-
dicament. In fact, if Deakin gets into office
over this wretched affair his position will almost
certainly be worse than it has ever been before.
He will be back where he was with three differ-
ences ; he will be minus much of the support which
the Fisher party used to give him ; he will
be minus much of the support and confidence of
his own followers ; and he will be plus
a huge and immediate liability, which—unless he
throws local defence, or old-age pensions, or the
Northern Territory, or the transcontinental rail-
ways overboard—will make his disordered and
shambling finances look like a fleeing army after
a great defeat.
Certainly there is still the chapter of accidents
to reckon with. The Fisher Government, if
defeated, may obtain a dissolution, though that
seems eminently improbable —in fact, it seems
that it would be quite unconstitutional, seeing
that, until Cook gets a show at forming a
Ministry, the possibilities of the House haven’t
been exhausted. And even should the impro-
bable event come to pass, there is no proof
that a general election would make the situation
much clearer. Then, by way of another possi-
bility, Deakin is a worn and weary-looking man
these times, and his physician may any day order
him out of the political arena for a rest, and by
the time he comes back refreshed the Dread-
nought question may have settled itself. Finally,
Deakin may go the way Abdul Hamid went, and
find his own followers clamoring at his palace
gate in South Yarra.and refusing to be led by him
any longer—in other words, they may refuse to
join him in taking a chance which may prove to
mean political suicide. But the chapter of acci-
dents isn’t much to rely upon. In all probability
the Fisher Government will go down, and then
chaos will supervene for a while, and the people
• —the patient, ox-like people who only want to
Get Things Done—will be left again. There are
so many things to be done—the new military
forces to organise, the navy to build, the Northern
Territory to be acquired and settled, the two abso-
lutely necessary transcontinental railways to be
constructed, the progressive land-tax to be im-
posed and collected for the bursting up of the
awful big estate incubus, the apparently serious
shortage in the funds available for the payment of
old-age pensions to be made good, the State debts
to be taken over, the question of the transfer to
the Commonwealth of the control of all
industrial legislation to Vie dealt with, the
growing demand for unification and recon-
struction to be looked to, and a number of other
matters to boot. The country, with all this work
on hand, can’t spare time for the constant swap-
ping of portfolios, which threatens to be all the
business which will be done this year. At such a
time as the present no one is justified in hanging
up public affairs indefinitely over a matter of the
presentation of a ship by a country which doesn’t
want to give it, to a country which doesn’t care
twopence whether it gets the blessed vessel or not.
* * * *
The obvious fact is that Parliamentary Govern-
ment as now practised has broken down. It has
fallen over its own feet and got into its own road.
It is a failure, and a bad failure at that. Even
when things are being done, the procedure eats
its own head off through the innumerable multi-
tude of formalities. As an instance, a Sydney
morning paper once in a bitter mood explained
the procedure necessary to get any small Bill—it
may be a measure of one clause, and that clause
may be some old thing about dogs—through the
N.S, W. Assembly, and in this matter the N.S.W.
Assembly is no worse and no better than its
neighbors :
(1) Message is read from the Governor asking that
necessary provision be made ; (2) message is referred to
the committee on the Bill; (3) Minister gives notice of
motion for the House to go into Committee to consider
expediency of bringing in the Bill; (4) motion is con-
sidered ; (5) motion moved that the Speaker should leave
the chair and the House go into Committee ; (6) resolu-
tion is carried in Committee ; (7) motion that Chairman
leave the chair ; (8) resolution is reported to the House ;
(9) resolution is adopted ; (10) Bill is introduced and read
<6, first time; (11) motion fixing date of second reading;
(12) second reading debate ; (13) motion to go into Com-
mittee to consider the Bill in detail; (14) motion for
Chairman to leave the chair and report the Bill with or
without amendments; (15) motion that the report be
now adopted ; (16) motion to fix date of third reading ;
(17) third reading ; (18) Speaker reports that the Bill is in
accordance with the Bill as passed in Committee; (19)
motion that the Bill do now pass ; (20) motion declaring
the title of the Bill; (21) motion that the Bill be sent to
the Legislative Council for concurrence.
After all this is done the Bill goes to the useless
Upper House, which plods through much the
same course of procedure. And the amendments,
if any, made by the Upper House have to be
considered, with much formality and an intermin-
able crawling into committee like a caterpillar
and crawling out of committee like a beetle, by
the Lower House ; and the decision arrived at by
the Lower House has to be pawed over at great
length by the Upper House ; and sometimes there
is a lengthy conference between the two institu-
tions ; and very often the end of the session
arrives in the middle of the struggle, and all this
fruitless effort goes into the heap of unfinished
business and is lost.
* * * *
This is how things are when Parliament is really
working, with the addition that many of these 21
stages of procedure are commonly used, not merely
for the purpose of curnbrously considering the Bill—
which, as already mentioned, may be some unim-
portant old thing in one clause relating to dogs—-
but for purposes of obstruction with a view to
getting the other party’s Government out and get-
ting “our ” party’s Government in. In addition,
there is an incredible waste of time through con-
spiracies against the Government, counter-con-
spiracies on behalf of the Government, changes
of Government, adjournments to let the new
Government have a chance to formulate its
policy ; through needless dissolutions and elec-
tions, through long shuttings-up because a weak
Government is afraid to face the Legislature, and
through other tortuous intrigues. And all the
while thg people who Want Things Done, who pay
for Having Things Done, and who don’t Get Things
Done, are neglected and unconsidered. They are
so accustomed to not having things done that
they hardly seem to realise that anything is
seriously amiss.
* * * #
The Bulletin has said all this before, but with
the prospect of another long hiatus or interregnum
while politicians swap portfolios, and another
vast hanging up of public business, the time has
arrived to siiy it all again. Australia needs first
of all a simplification of Parliamentary pro-
cedure. Then it badly needs to make the Refer-
endum a part of its political policy, so that
the real opinion of the country on any urgent
question can be easily ascertained, and the ghost
of sham opinion which is raised by the daily press
can be laid. In the matter of the Federal capital,
for instance, the Sydney dailies declared so per-
sistently that N.S.W. wouldn’t have Dalgety at
any price, and that the State would sooner secede
than have the metropolis anywhere save at Can-
berra, that many foolish politicians really came to
believe that their only hope of political salvation
lay in making haste to join a movement that
didn’t exist. And in similar fashion the assurances
of the daily press that Australia would sooner fall
down dead than not present Britain with a Dread-
nought are driving foolish politicians to rush
headlong into a crusade which only exists in
the fervid imagination of that same daily
press. The Referendum would be a prompt
and simple means of clearing these gaseous
bogies out of the political path, and would
thus make politics much more workable than they
are. It is necessary to have the Second Ballot in
order to make Parliament a better reflex of popular
opinion. And,.above all, it is essential to at least
make an experiment with Elective Ministries,
appointed for a fixed term, in order to save the
ghastly loss of time which arises from the shuffling
around of portfolios, and in schemes, devices, con-
spiracies and cabals with a view to the shuffling
round of portfolios. On every question that can
possibly arise there must needs be in Parliament
a majority for or against. And if a system can be
adopted under which every question must be con-
sidered on its own individual merits, apart from
the side issues which now arise through the per-
petual desire to get the other fellow out of office
and to put our own fellow into office—if the fellow
in office is there for a fixed term whether his
measures are defeated or not then the
Parliamentary machine can hardly help
travelling at a greatly increased pace. It
is not necessary to make the experiment
of Elective Ministries a fixed and permanent de-
vice at first. If the community is nervous about
the result, the idea might first be tried for, say,
six years, things to revert automatically after that
time to the old party system, unless the Elective
Ministries law was re-enacted. Even the most
scared member of the community could hardly
object to a six years’ trial of the proposed policy.
* * * *
It seems a pity that there should be a stoppage
to grease the political machinery at a time when
progress is so essential. But there are so many
things to be done, and the old system seems so
pathetically incapable of doing them. Progress
has never been easy or rapid, because the anti-
quated political devices were always stopping to
fall over their own feet, always getting in their
own road, always coming to a dead stand in the
middle of the stream to change a blind horse for
a lame one, or a dead horse for an imaginary one.
And now that there are signs ahead of another
breakdown—the country hasn’t yet got started
after the last one—and another indefinite
stoppage, and another swapping in the middle of
the stream of a jibbing horse for a confirmed bolter
—well, if the community’s patience isn’t worn out
it ought to be.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
There is Only One Dalgety, and Carruthers
is its Prophet.
The Monaro district of N.S.W. (the table-land on
which stands Dalgety by the Snowy River, the
place that was selected, and may be again
selected, as a Federal capital site) held
its annual show the other day; and the
mere enumeration of the things produced on that
allegedly barren plateau and exhibited by the
allegedly non-existent inhabitants thereof filled five
columns in the local paper. There were sheep, of
course, also horses, pigs, cows, hens, and sundries
in great numerousness. In addition, however,
there were peaches, grapes, pears, and many other
kinds of fruit grown in the country which the
Sydney papers described as too bleak for human
habitation ; and the region where the infuriated
Teece, of the A.M.P. Society, declared vegetables
to be impossible, put 26 kinds of vegetable on
exhibition in large quantities, in addition
to wheat, lucerne, maize, etc., all of local
growth. The exhibits were very tine and large,
but the exhibition which N.S.W.’s ex-Premier
Cakruthers made of himself was the most re-
markable exhibit of all. After Wade’s Minister
for Agriculture had enthused over the splendors
of the district which Wade declares to be quite
unfit for the inhabitants of a Federal capital to
live in, and somebody named Miller had pro-
posed Carruthers’ health and made a touching
reference to the fact that a crop of Monaro wheat
had been known to reach as high as 40 or 50
bushels to the acre, Carruthers (the man who
originally declared a capital bn Monaro to be
beyond all possibility owing to the sterile and
inhospitable character of the country) upended
himself and spoke a piece. (Part of his little
oration has already appeared in The Bulletin,
but it is good enough to be worth printing twice): —
Mr. J. H. Carruthers thanked the gathering for the
reception accorded him. He noticed his old friend Mr.
Harnett, the “Man from Snowy River,” whom he
had seen in Parliament for 25 years past. (Applause.)
He thought that the way Mr. Harnett used to recite
that poem instilled him with a desire to come to the
“ roof of Australia,” and see the old place where they bred
the men from the Snowy River. (Applause.) Then there
was his old friend, Mr. Merrett, who with a bottle of
wine christened a peak which would for all time bear the
speaker’s name. (Applause.) He contrasted the life of
the man on the land, its freedom, and contact with the
bracing atmosphere, with that of the dweller in the city,
and expressed the belief that there was no part of Aus-
tralia that had such a splendid climate as Monaro ; and
not only for crops, but children. (Applause.) They
wanted an Experimental Farm in the district, which was
a good one for agriculture.
It might be reasonably supposed that the speaker
was quite a different man from the one who raved
for three years to the effect that bleak and barren
Monaro was wholly disqualified by Nature for the
site of a Federal city, but he was carefully in-
spected, back and front, by butchers and other
meat experts, who solemnly guaranteed that
he was the same Carruthers. Also he was iden-
tified by the police. Apparently the difference
lies in the fact that Joseph is no longer Premier,
and is no longer required, for the sake of his
billet, to sacrifice the interests of Australia to
those of the Sydney daily papers, which want the
Federal city planted so close to their own offices
that they will be able to command the circulation
and advertising business of the inhabitants. On
no other hypotheses can the amazing discrepancy
between the Joe that was and the Joseph that is
be accounted for.
»
Wade is Still Unsatisfied.
The latest news about the Federal capital is to
the effect that even now State Premier Wade
isn’t satisfied. Apparently W ade wili never be
satisfied. The Australian Parliament has done a
lot for the gratification of Wade, and it
has failed. In the first place it backed down to
him re the matter of the site, and agreed to put
the capital where he wanted it. Then it was
realised that if the capital of all Australia was to
have even the semblance of an occasional drink,
it must include those two notable trickles, the
Cotter and the Molonglo, and if they were both
included in a square bit of ground it would run to
about 2000 or 2500 square miles. So the bit of
ground was disembowelled, so to speak, and it
consists on the map of one long leg along the
Cotter, and another long leg along the Molonglo,
and the two legs are joined together at the top
by a bit of land like the handle of a carpet
bag. It is a ridiculous device, but it keeps the
proposed Federal territory down to 1000 square
miles—to oblige Wade. To further oblige Wadk,
who doesn’t want to give away anything valuable,
the land selected includes the most rocky and
barren stretches in the district. This is made
quite a feature of by the State Frights press ; on
April 21 the S. M. Herald dealt with it again in
a leader headed “Australia’s City,” and assured
all and sundry that the land—
however excellent for catchment purposes, is vert little
USE FOR ANYTH INS ELSE.
Yet, even though the fool of a Federal Parliament
has tried to oblige Wade by selecting, for the site
of the one city in all the world which is to be the
capital of a whole continent, a mass of dull and
useless rocks —even after that there is a dead bee
in Wade’s ointment. The selection couldn’t
avoid including the little town of Queanbeyan
with about 1200 people, and Wade says the
State can’t be expected to part with “an import-
ant place like Queanbeyan.” So now it is difficult
to know what can be done to satisfy the awful and
grumpy Wade. His views seem to be :
(1) The capital must be in New South Wales.
(2) It must be as close up as possible to the most
thickly-peopled section of N.S.W.
(3) At the same time it mustn’t contain any population
worth mentioning. It must be an empty area in the
middle of a fairly thick population.
(4) And as the Federal city must have some water, and
most watercourses of any size in fairly well-settled dis-
tricts have towns on them, and the sulky infant Wade
bars the surrender of towns, it seems that the only way
to please Wade is to make the capital perfectly dry.
And there is no guarantee that Wade would be
satisfied even then. In fact, the chances are that
he would find some excuse for being madder than
ever.

The Slump of Cook.
When Prime Minister Fisher declared his
naval policy Joe Cook, that weird political joke,
arose in great scorn and denounced the scheme as
straight-out lunacy. Anybody who knew any-
thing about the subject, Cook explained, was per-
fectly aware that a coastal defence scheme was
absurd ; and that destroyers were worse than use-
less. They could never hope to defend the coast
against those modern monsters of the Dreadnought
type; and “anybody who knew anything about
the matter” knew that the naval battle that
would decide the fate of the Empire and
Australia would be fought in either the North
Sea or the Pacific. The thing that
brought to an end the denunciation of
Joseph the Renegade was the giving out
of the English language. This modern embodi-
ment of Hannibal, Nelson and Julius Caesar
simply could not find words to express his derision
and contempt for the ignorance of Fisher and his
colleagues—especially one named Hughes, whom
he derisively described as “Admiral” Hughes.
There are occasions when it is better for turn-coat
politicians of the Cook stamp to trim, to hedge,
and to be vague and indefinite. And it is unfortu-
nate for Cook that the only subject on which be
let himself go and fluted to the top of his bent is
the one on which the Imperial representatives have
a right to give full utterance. Australian defence is
merely a part of Imperial defence, and on that
ground the Imperial representatives in Australia
are entitled to speak. At the recent annual
dinner of the N.S.W. Society of St. George in
Sydney, Governor-General Dudley and Admiral
Richard Poore both spoke on this subject; and in
doing so they biffed Cook and the Sydney Tele-
graph where they both lived. Admiral Poore
said that he had come to the conclusion that "a
torpedo flotilla and destroyers would be of tre-
mendous advantage to Australia. The moral
effect, in case of war, and the British navy
being withdrawn from these waters, would be
splendid, if an Australian squadron were ready
to defend the coasts. . . . The best defence
of the Empire lay in the power of in-
stantly taking the offensive.” And, of course,
the presence of an Australian coastal squad-
ron to beat off raiding cruisers or squadrons,
would make it easier for the Imperial authorities
to concentrate the big fighting ships where they
would do the most good. Them the Governor-
General proceeded to give Cook his finishing
stroke. Said his Ex. : “ Speaking personally, I
am entirely in favor of the formation of an Aus-
tralian navy. ... I believe that the time is ar-
riving when every part of the Empire must make
due contribution to Imperial defence. . . . How
are these provisions to be made ? Either by giv-
ing an adequate subsidy in money, or by a
contribution of ships and men of your
own. . . . To give an adequate contribution
you would have to set aside £2,000,000 or
£3,000,000. Is it likely you will ever be
able to get that sum without obtaining what is
impossible l —a voice in the management or control
of the policy. I believe you will get far more
from this country in the way of ships and men.”
Now the question is whether Joe Cook is pre-
pared to upend himself and denounce Admiral
Poore and Governor-General Dudley as men
who don’t know what they are talking about, and
to speak derisively of his Ex. as “Admiral”
Dudley ? Anyhow, after his cocksure howls of a
few weeks ago it is “up to” Joe Cook to either
do that fearsome thing, or admit candidly that he
is an ignoramus—a blatant skiter, who spoke em-
phatically on a subject of which he was entirely
ignorant.
■» - -
The Fruits of Industry.
A committee was recently appointed by the Labor
Congress of N.S.W. to think hard over proposals
for a Federation of Labor, and the committee
drew up an interim report and a draft programme
for the proposed Federation. Here is the beginning
of the report:—
OBJECTS.
That the objective of the federation shall be to obtain
for the workers the full fruits of their industry.
The thing stopped there, and left the matter as
undefined as Joseph Cook’s principles. For
what is “the full fruits of their industry?” How
much of the fruits is it proposed to set aside as
remuneration for the inventor, the man with a
genius for organisation, and the man with the
capacity for supervision. There is no talent
required to inherit and own land, <lnd let it out to
tenants, and raise the rents on every possible
occasion, and live on the unearned increment.
Any fool can do these things, and any fool does
them. The landowner isn’t industry; therefore The
Bulletin believes that land should be national-
ised, or else that the area of country land which
one man can own should be limited to the amount
which will furnish a good living for himself and
family, the area being varied according to the soil


and rainfall; and that, if the owner gives up
cultivating his own property and lets it, his tenant
should have the right of compulsory purchase at
a price fixed by the State. Again, there is no
talent required to inherit bank and insurance
shares, therefore The Bulletin believes in State
banking and State insurance. But invention, dis-
covery, the capacity for organisation and manage-
ment, must be paid for, and in many cases they
must be paid for at very high prices if the best
service is to be obtained. There is no reason why
the man who gets £lOO,OOO, or even £500,000,
for the discovery of a great mineral held, or
for a great wealth-producing invention, or a
man who gets £5OOO or £lO,OOO a year
for managing or organising an industry
should be allowed to invest his money in land or
in any other way that will give his incapable
descendants an ever-increasing lien upon the earn-
ings of posterity for all time. The reward
shouldn’t apply to incapable descendants, but the
reward of the man who actually does great things
should be magnificent. If there is no great
opportunity to invest the money at compound
interest then the fortune which the industrial
Solomon made will speedily dissipate in the
hands of the industrial Rehoboams who come
after, and will go back to the people from whom it
came; bqt Solomon’s own reward should be large,
otherwise Solomon will go elsewhere. According
to the Federal Statistician, the whole value of pro-
duction in Australia and Tasmania in 1907
agricultural, pastoral, mining, manufacturing, and
all the rest—was £107,000,000. If that were
equally divided it would represent nearly £4O
a year per inhabitant, or £2OO a year for
a family of five—father, mother, and three
children. If the useless landlord—not the one
who owns a moderate bit of land and works it to
the best advantage, but the mere superfluous col-
lector of rents—were eliminated, and all the
useless elements of the population were forced to
become producers, there seems no reason why
production should not represent £5O per head.
With new devices and new inventions there is no
reason why it should not in time reach £lOO per
head—equal to nearly £lO a week for every family
of five. And there is no reason why it should
not go on increasing indefinitely after that.
But if by ‘'the worker” is meant the
purely manual toiler, he can’t get the com-
plete fruits of all that production, for in-
vention and organisation must be paid for
at a handsome rate. Otherwise things will
get no further forward, and to go no
further forward is to go back—to the dogs and
the Devil. For though the invention and organ-
isation that we have to-day may be equal to pro-
ducing £4O worth of wealth per head per annum,
yet half a century hence they may be so obsolete as
not to be worth £5 per annum. There was a time
in Australia when, so far as history relates, the
worker did enjoy “ the full fruits of his industry,”
but for lack of invention and organisation he was
still a mere aboriginal, worth about ss. every 12
months, and followed by a lot of unregistered dogs
of the flea-bitten religion. Therefore, it is up to
the responsible parties, whoever they may be, to
more clearly define their position, which at present
is only a platitude. The mere land lord is superfluous,
bo is the mere usurer, bo are a host of mere com-
mercial parasites. But the inventor and the
organiser are indispensable, and they need to be
lavishly paid if the services of the best of them
are to be secured. Where do they come in, and
what is their share of the “fruits” ?
A Fleet and Its Tail.
A student of the Blue Water kindergarten sends
this :
Sir Edward Grey’s horrifying statement that Britain
needs to re-build the whole fleet should wring a wail of
protest from the British taxpayer, already tottering
under the mere cost of upkeep of and additions to the
floating ironmongery. The modern fleet is very like a
kangaroo—it has a long tail. But the Too has a big
advantage over the fleet, for his tail is his main support:
the fleet’s tail is an unreliable encumbrance which retards
its speed, but which has to be depended on more or less,
and trailed carefully across the oceans. The admirals
have to lose their sleep thinking out plans so that the
weak, slow old-timers may be. last into the possible row
and first out of it. Altogether the veteran ships are a
continual anxiety ; but, although Britain has an immense
number of them, the other nations also have their fair
share. In the official lists, the acknowledged tail of each
navy is called “older,” while the useful body part is
known as “ modern." The battleship anatomy of the sea
was lately set down as under; —
' Building or
Modern. Older. Laid Down. Total.
Britain ..41 13 6 60
Germany 20 4 7 31
France 16 5 6 27
Italy ..6 6 5 17
United States 21 4 8 33
Japan ..10 6 3 19
114 38 35 187
Of course there is now a suspicion that some of these
statistics are quite unreliable ; still they were latelv
accepted as correct. It is only the big, heavily-armed
and armored ships that count when two fleets that look
like two chains of smoky dots start to get within
five or six miles of each other. Then it is a
case of “Seconds out of the ring!”—and the sort
of things that are labelled “ Powerful,” but which are
merely “ Horrible,” scuttle clear of the impending crash.
So we get the battleship strength of the world as some-
thing well under 200 units—which estimate mav safely
cover the Dreadnought Maoriland threatens to borrow,
and the GotnothingN.S. W. is trying to beg. (Luckily, the
Yankee fleet got clear of Sydney Harbor before this craze
for collecting, battleships set in ; otherwise Wade might
have seized them even as his colleague Carruthkrs seized
the wire netting from the wharf.) Another standard of
comparison other than -the number of battleships may be
taken ; it is the total number of ships carrying guns equal
or superior to those of the Dreadnoughts. Only ships
aimed with these tremendously powerful weapons will be
able to penetrate, at a four-miles range, the llin. armored
belts that guard the vitals of the sea-giants. Ships whose
armament is not sufficiently powerful to pierce the Dread-
nought armor at that distance are liable to be hammered
to death—if they have the bad luck to engage one of the
modern fighting machines ; for their shells will be bursting
more or less harmlessly about the big brother’s ribs while
he is standing off and smashing them at his leisure.
Apparently, the only hope of the older ships is that, when
the great day comes, they may exchange shots with
equally decrepit tanks. On the gun-power test, Bull
does not show up so well; in fact, he shows up rather
badly. By 1911 he will have 12 ships fitted with guns
powerful enough to puncture a Dreadnought at four
miles; but Japan and the U.S.A. will both be on the
same mark with a dozen each ; France will be ambling
along with six or eight; and Germany will have collected
16—which will give it a lead of four on Bull, unless the
agitation in England forces the Government to
build four more; or unless Maoriland gives two
and bursts gloriously like a patriotic f -og, and
Australia gives two more and swoons ..way for
several years on Cohen’s doormat. But, although there
is a mad desire to rule out every blessed thing that isn’t
Dreadnought, it isn’t common sense to ignore the battle-
ships of the King Edward class, of which England has
about six times the number owned by William of Berlin.
All the scare naval estimates nowadays seem to be
based on the assumption that something very near
approaching perfection and finality has been reached ;
but, to the reasoning outsider, it looks the sort of ram-
shackle logic that is built for the political needs of a day.
The King Edwards and their near relatives (they
are of about the same age and gun-power as the
U.S. ships we admired recently) are sufficiently
well armed to argue with all the ships of the
pre-Dreadnought era at four miles range, and, as they
are in the proportion of six to Germany’s one, there
doesn’t seem to be any ground for nervousness on their
middle-aged account. If the big row ever does arrive, it
will probably divide itself into two parts. The first will
be a wild and awful struggle between the Dread-
nought pugilists or their successors ; and the second
will be a slightly less impressive conflict—or
series of conflicts—between the old-age pensioners.
The first is very likely to result in the ruination
of both sets of pugs, for they will probably be very
evenly matched in strength and numbers, and the victor
will most likely feel much too sick for further trouble,
but, whereas Germany has only a handful of old men of
the sea, Britain has a vast horde of them ; and, when the
mastodons have ceased their clashing, these will sally
forth with their whiskers streaming in the gale, and
the foreign venerables will fly appalled before them.
Britain certainly lias a long' naval tail, but there does not
appear to be any necessity to get hysterical about it. In
a world of tadpoles, surely it is an advantage to be the
fattest and longest tadpole of the lot!
An Evil that Toryism Mourns Over, but
Won’t Have Scotched.
Melbourne Argus handled the “ social evil ” in
gingerly fashion the other day, and wound up the
usual batch of grieved but strictly non-committal
remarks on the subject by saying, with a show of
decision: —
It is a matter that urgently-demands the attention of
the Government, with a view to new legislation being
proposed.
It is the sort of thing that papers like the Argus,
and that the people who follow the Argus’ poli-
tical lead, have been saying very firmly ever since
the oldest of us can remember. That they will
continue doing so till the Crack of Doom is quite
sure. It is also quite sure that if any Government
makes the slightest attempt to introduce legislation
to mitigate the said “ evil,” the Argus and those
who think with it will emit the same old shriek
of shocked disapproval which they set up when,
during the Dreadnought pother, someone
ventured to talk of Australian defence. The
most recent attempt which has been made in
Australia to legislate in regard to the evil which,
the Argus says “urgently demands legislative
attention,” was that of N.S.W. State Premier
Wade, who, some months ago, submitted a Conta-
gious Diseases Bill to the N.S.W. Parliament. It
wasn’t much of a Bill at best. All it provided for
was the treatment of apprehended criminals.
The step that was suggested wasn’t a particularly
revolutionary one—merely that no one who, on
admission to a State gaol, should be found to be
suffering from a certain appalling complaint,
should be allowed to mix with the world
again till he or she should have been
cured. Both the Sydney morning dailies had
written during the previous couple of months of
the horrifying results of the complaint which
Wade’s legislation was designed to check. An
evening paper had devoted a series of special
articles to it, and in the course of them had men-
tioned that Sydney was one of the half-dozen
most disease-accursed ports in the world. “ Fleet
week” was drawing near. The police were in-
structed to take action “for the credit of the
State,” and so hundreds of the better-known street
women were apprehended on trifling charges, and
locked up till the Yankee tars had gone. Every-
one appreciated the ghastliness of the trouble and
the desirableness of not merely tinkering with it,
but of dealing with it in comprehensive fashion.
And yet when Wade’s measure bobbed above
the horizon, which it did shortly after the de-
parture of the U.S.A. fleet, a scream of pious
dissent resounded from every corner of the State.
Christian Temperance Unions, Methody parsons,
Loyal Orange lunatics, local preachers, hot gos-
pellers, and a thousand other rabbit-brained
citizens and organisations sent petitions to Wade
and begged him, in the name of holiness, not to
interfere with the disease. The dailies started
talking uneasily about “ the liberty of the subject,”
and “experimental legislation,” and otherwise
poured chilled fluid on the measure. In the end,
Wade was constrained to give his measure to the
State under the harmless-sounding alias of the
Prisoners’ Detention Bill, and as such it does a
considerable amount of good work. It wastypicalof
whatalways liappenswhen Toryismand piety work
together. The complaint on which Wade desired
to make war is responsible for a goodly proportion
of the idiots, cripples, perverts, criminals and
other hopeless ones who afflict society. It is as
preventable as plague or the smallpox, and infi-
nitely more loathsome and deadly and far-reaching
in its effects than either. It strikes the innocent
even more than the guilty. Yet the churches
(the same religious element which labored to sup-
press washing many centuries ago) toil for the
preservation of the disease, and Toryism, which
is the Church in politics, is on the same side.

Again tlie Capital-Scaring Slander.
Sydney Telegraph weighed in (21/4/’O9) with an
unusually acrid assault on the alleged capital-
scaring effects of Labor in Australia. Its text
was supplied by Dr. J. Robertson, an amazing
Scotchman recently returned from abroad, and on
the strength of his remarks the papers said :
A good deal of truth is in Dr. Robkrtson’s statement
that British capital is not being put into Australian
enterprise, because the British capitalist distrusts our
Socialistic tendencies and Labor domination. London
can lend to the State Governments because the country
is pledged, but to Private Enterprise practically nothing
is coming. ... There would be many millions more paid in
wages in Australia annually, but that Labor implaca-
bility shuts it out. It is its own worst enemy, and de-
prives the working man of a large percentage of his
proper wages.
The Telegraph is one of those sheets that seems
chronically unable to understand that any country
can have capital invested in it, to its (the
country’s) advantage, unless the said capital has
been imported from abroad. A country, for ex-
ample, that is finding its own capital for its own
industries appeals to it (unless its printed words
belie it most villainously) as on the verge of dis-
aster. Whatever the invariably anonymous
British capitalist, whom purveyors of decayed
fish of the Telegraph and Robertson brand
consort with, may profess to think about the
local Labor menace, and whatever steps he may
say he is driven to take in consequence of it, the
fact remains that the indigenous capitalist (the man
on the spot, and the one, therefore, with the best
opportunities of knowing the correct state of
affairs) is by no means chary of sinking his cash in
Australia. The Bulletin can board a tram
outside the front door of its office, and
in a matter of six minutes can find itself at
the biggest warehouse south of the,line. In the
days when the Telegraph’s Tory and Foreign-
trade friends ran the §how in N.S.W., this estab-
lishment imported everything from abroad. To-
day its factories cover a larger area than its shop.
An immense fortune has been sunk in them.
They employ an army of white Australians at
white men’s wages. >And the owners are doing
well out of their venture, and don’t seem to worry
one iota about the Menace of Toil which keeps
the unspecified over-sea acquaintances of Robert-
son and the Telegraph in a constant state of the
jumps. It is but one example out of scores.
Everywhere in Sydney and environs, under Pro-
tection and advanced Labor legislation, tweed
and woollen and furniture and boot and pottery
and hat manufactures are springing up.
That is a fact that may be ascertained by
a cruise round the city and suburbs any
day of the working week. Capital (wherever it
has come from) has gone into concerns that have
lapped up the out-of-work so effectively that his
sort is probably harder to find in Sydney to-day
than in any other city of its size in the world.
The Telegraph buttresses its argument that the
British capitalist regards Australia as a doomed
country by the statement that London only lends
to its State Governments because “the country is
pledged.” And yet the London capitalist, who
lias already lent N.S.W. £88,000,000, and who
continues to lend further millions when
asked, is just as dependent for the safety of
his money on the integrity and sane behavior of
Laborites and Labor Ministries, present and to
come, as any investor in any private enterprise
concern in any of the States. The Telegraph
talks largely of the country being “pledged.” But
what is that likely to signify if its inhabitants and
administrators are the mad-headed Anarchists
that the anti-Australian section here and abroad
represents them to be. Nations and States,
mostly under anti-Labor Governments, have re-
pudiated their debts before; and, where their
Governments are the sort that Anti-Sosh says
Labor Governments are they will do it again.
Austria did it in 1811, and again in 1816. It
paid about 7d. in the £. The Russian Empire
declared itself bankruptin 1843. Spain and Turkey
have let their creditors in at different times, and
so, in the most impudent and wanton fashion,
have various States of theU. S. of America, whose
position under the Law of Nations is almost
exactly analogous to those of the States of the
Commonwealth. As Melbourne Age noted last
week :
Probably few people are aware of the immense amount
of money that has been lent to foreign nations that have
failed to keep faith with their creditors. British
investors, unfortunately, are largely concerned in such
transactions, and, in order to safeguard their interests,
an organisation, called the Corporation of Foreign Bond-
holders, was created in London as far back as 1868. Since
its institution, this body has helped in the settlement of
debts aggregating £1,000,000,000, and its report for 1908
shows that it has still under review a principal sum of
£16,000,000 owing by defaulting States, in addition to
arrears of interest thereon amounting to £30,620,000.
With that sort of object-lesson before him, the
knowledgable British money-lender, who is the
British capitalist, is unlikely to splash his
coin round in places where “Labor domin-
ation,” or any other domination, appears
to him to threaten catastrophe. The British
capitalist who was going to invest huge sums in
Australian industries, but decided ultimately that
he wouldn’t do it owing to “Socialism,” is a
nebulous person who is constantly mentioned by
the anti-Australian confidence crowd, but is never
produced. The British capitalist who is so sure
of the probity, decency and common-sense of the
Laborites, who are the coming administrators of
most of this continent, that he is prepared to add
to the already huge sum lie has sunk here by way
of loans, is a tangible flesh-ajid-blood citizen. He
stands as permanent proof that the people who
say that Labor domination and Socialism and
the rest frighten away the real Briton with real
money at the back of him are slanderous liars.

It is only about a week since N.S. W. State Insect
Wade inquired plaintively why the Australian
Parliament proposed to interfere in industrial
matters. All the States, barring Tasmania, had
machinery for the protection of the workers ; and
Tasmania, he was assured, would soon have simi-
lar legal gear to prevent sweating. It seemed to
Wade that the Australian Parliament was
really interfering where there was no neces-
sity. What did the Australian Parliament
want, anyhow ? Last Monday week a deputa-
tion from the Labor Congress waited on
Wade’s chief railway commissioner, Johnson.
The deputation requested that he would follow
the practice of the Public Works Department, and
insert a clause in all contracts insisting on a living
wage and prohibiting the practice of sub-letting.
Mr. Johnson said he was opposed to sweating, but
he would not insertany conditions into thecontracts
to prevent it. He would not interfere with Private
Enterprise. At the same time he would not encour-
age sweating. How he is to prevent sweating
if he will not interfere with Private Enterprise he
did not explain ; altogether, judging by his reply,
Mr. Johnson is a glorified example of George
Reid and his Yes-No. Johnson’s attitude
is that he was imported to make a com-
mercial success of the railways, and he
will not do anything that may inter-
fere with the process of lowering expenses.
If the men are not satisfied with the rates paid,
Johnson suggested that they should invoke the
Court; and if the Court ordered him to insert
such a clause as that suggested he would obey the
Court. Johnson gave them his word of honor he
would obey the Court. Johnson’s attitude was
somewhat of an answer to Mr. Wade’s plaintive
inquiry as to why the Australian Parliament
wants to interfere. The Commonwealth desires a
tribunal whose decisions shall apply to the whole
of Australia, and whose awards cannot be evaded
by shifting the scene of operations a few miles
from some metropolitan centre. Also it wants a
Court clothed with such powers that it will be
quite needless for Mr. Johnson to promise that
he will respect its decisions —a Court of such a
character that Johnson’s acceptance of its deci-
sions will be one of those obvious things which
nobody thinks of mentioning just on account of
their obviousness.
Premier Murray, of Victoria, bids fair to
be as bad a failure as Bent. During Easter
week he was spreading himself round his
electorate of Warrnambool, and certain land-
hungry persons drew his attention to the
Chocolyn estate, which has blocked the pro-
gress of Camperdown district since it was first
locked up to graze sheep. Chocolyn was sought
by Bent’s abortive Closer Settlement Board, but
the owners asked £3O per acre, and the Board
reckoned it was too much. But Murray
was told that, owing to Bent’s land-booming
policy, the estate would to-day actually bring
£33 or £35 per acre. Murray's interro-
gators hinted at some measure or policy
that would tend to reduce the Chocolyn
acres to their real value—based on their produc-
tive capacity —and remarked casually that, for
land-tax purposes, the place is at present valued
at £4 per acre, and pays £207 per annum ; where-
as under an honest valuation, Fisher’s proposed
land-tax would collect £2360 per annum. Then
the turncoat Premier roused himself and assured
the hungry settlers that “special legislation was
needed to deal with a case like this.” He didn’t
give any defails about this “special legislation” ;
neither did he hint at any intention to levy an
effective land-tax, and so save the Federal Parlia-
ment the trouble of doing his (Murray’s) work.
He merely notified the need for “special legisla-
tion,’’and fell asleep again.
From the “ Old Soldier ” :
The O’Sullivan told the people at gaud Mayor
Taylor’s Dreadnought meeting in Sydney what he would
do if he were Dictator in Britain. He would send the
British fleet to look for the German navy. In 70, when
the German navy consisted of only one ship of any
account, the French fleet went to the Baltic to look for
it, and also to bombard the fortress at Colberg. It could
neither find the fleet nor get within range of anything
worth firing at. Perhaps the O’Sullivan’s Admiral would
have better (or worse) fortune. Germany nowadays has a
fleet, and its coast defences are in order, so O’Sullivan’s
Admiral might not have the Frenchman’s luck.
After groping among the islands and mudflats
that line the whole German North Sea coast,
and getting half his ships aground, he might decide to go
round into the Baltic, only fo learn that the whole Ger-
man fleet had gone through the Kiel Canal into the
North Sea, and was working its wicked will in parts un-
known. Since the meeting, the O’Sullivan seems to
have been thinking things over, and has apparently come
to the conclusion that it is not quite good for his political
health to oppose the babor policy ; so he has written to
the Telegraph to explain that he is in favor of the Fisher
naval defence scheme for Australia, but he wants— OK,
so badly!—“ to present a Dreadnought to the British
Government as a testimony of the loyalty and good will
of the Australian people,” and “to increase (he fight-
ing strength of the British Navy when the crisis comes
with Germany in the North Sea or English Channel.”
O’Sullivan, like all the rest of the hysterical gang, evi-
dently sees visions of a “decisive battle in the North Sea.”
Battles are never decisive unless one of the fleets or armies
engaged is utterly broken and scatlered, and the other
has a reserve of force able to follow up its success. No
one can tell before it begins how a general action
will end, but it is pretty certain that both sides will
be battered into helplessness. That applies specially
to sea-fights. It is notorious that after Tsu-shima
all the guns of the Simian fleet were unserviceable ; and if
there had been only a small Russian reserve of ships
capable of putting up a fight, the tables might have been
turned. So well is that understood, that no prudent
commander will exert his full force, either by land or sea,
against an equal, or nearly equal, enemy if he can help
it. The more skilful commander can always refuse to
accept battle on terms that do not suit him. But now
the question is: If Britain goes on building Dread-
noughts, can it man them '/ German}’, with compulsory
service, and the marine population of the Baltic and
North Sea coasts to draw on, can hardly run short of sea-
men ; but Britain, with voluntarily recruited long-service
boys in its navy, and Chows and Lascars in its merchant
ships, is in a very different position.
The knell of Freetrade is being rung even in
the Chambers of Commerce throughout Britain.
A preliminary clang happened nearly three years
ago, when the Council of the London Chamber
called a meeting and took a vote on a resolution
which had been intended to prevent any discussion
of Tariff Reform. The Council put up one of its

While the British firms in Hankow are merely branches
of houses in Shanghai, their Chinese rivals, who have
driven them out of the import trade, are Hankow mer-
chants with branches in Shanghai. There are about 11
of these big native firms which supply the Hankow
market with British cotton goods, and which have risen
on the ruins of British competitors.—“ The Yangtze
Valley and Beyond,” by J. P. Bishop, p. 6k.
Sha-shih is the Manchester of China, the adjacent court-
try being the greatest centre pf weaving’ in the empire.
Cotton cloth and silk fabrics are the staple exports.
Enormous quantities of raw cotton arrive to be woven at
Sha-shih into a strong, durable cfoth, which I saw all over
Sze Chuan, and of which at least .20,000,0001 b. are ex-
ported annually. Samples of this make, and of English
cottons, were frequently shown to me in Sze Chuan
villages—with a scornful laugh at the expense of the
latter. ... A weaver’s wages come to about Is. 6d, per
week. Can Lancashire compete with this?— lbid., pp.

Vkry horrible to see is this Yellow industree—
Very sad indeed for Britain, where the Cobden
fetich dwells;
Our friend the gentle Chow
Starts to manufacture now—-
He can publish twills and cottons quite as well as
dreadful smells :
Hear the Briton at Shanghai—
As his rivals hustle by,
Hear him weeping o’er the ruins of his branch
importery ;
For his Chow competitor
Passeth onward with a roar,
Strewing China with the samples of his haber-
dashery !
Strewing China with his twills,
Made in “foreign devil” mills—
Sweating Hodge in distant Bury and in Bolton
far away ;
The merchant at Hankow
Preacheth “China for the Chow,”
And his junks go trailing westward crammed
with cotton goods to-day !
Hear the cursing lao-pan on the road to Sze
Chuan—
To the distant empire province up the broad
Yangtze Kiang ;
With the products of Sha-shih—
Towing onward earnestly,
Hear the howling of the trackers in the gorges of
I-chang!
See the bagman Chow a-sweat,
Tramping forward thro’ Tibet—
Selling hats and socks in Lhasa, where the Llama
folk abide;
He is loading up the yak,
P l l ing.softgoods on its back.
For the cheapness of his fabrics spreadeth daily
far and wide !
Paying one-and-six a week —
Growing fat and very sleek.
Thus the profits flow in torrents to the yellow
cotton man ;
Far away in Lancashire,
Bull is feeling very queer,
For the Chow hath rattled Cobden in Hu-Peh
and old Yu-Nan !
Very ominous indeed is this downfall of the
Creed—
The British creed of cheapness mouthed by
Cobden years ago;
If the Chow is cheaper still,
Woe to Britain’s loom and mill—
Woe to Chorley and St. Helen’s, woe likewise to
Clitheroe!
For the Chow is on the spot,
While the Cobden folk are not—
Yea, the Chow pervadeth Asia from Chi-Li to
Turkestan ;
When he knocks at India’s door,
Startled Bull will hear the roar
Of the Chow’s protecting partner, Brother Monkey
from Japan !
So the outlook seemeth blue
For the niddering Cobden crew—
And the joss of foolish Britain waxeth wet about
the feet.
If three tanners hire the Chow
For a week, then Bull must bow—

own members to move this obstructive resolution
in the character of an independent outsider, and
a German—one of many Anglo-Germans identi-
fied with the Cobden Club —seconded the motion.
It was defeated on a show of hands, and squelched
when the Freetraders demanded a poll. That was
in 1906. Last month there was a meeting (the
49th) of the Association of Chambers of the
United Kingdom, and it was moved : “That this
country should release itself from its present
rigid system of one-sided Freetrade by broaden-
ing the basis of taxation and reforming its fiscal
system, and thus enable itself to meet foreign
competitors on equal terms.” The hard-shell
Freetraders tried in the first place to shelve
the motion. The majority insisted on a vote,
and the Tariff Reformers scored 46 against
31, another 32 members perching themselves
on the “neutral” rail. Nothing came of the
resolution, I localise its actual supporters were not
;v two-thirds majority of the members present.
But if there are more Reformers than Con-
servative Freetraders in the Chambers of Com-
merce to-day, it seems pretty certain that Re-
form will be a straight-out policy of Protection
when it comes to pass in the House of Commons.
The almost immediate result of the great change
when it arrives will be a popular outcry that
“ Hingland is ruined,” and a dire defeat of the
Government at next election. After which Hing-
land will discover that ruin spelt salvation rather
than damnation.

Concerning a Man Named Cobden.
Ip Saint Cobden (who was certainly canonised by
the great commercial class of England about half
a century ago) could be resurrected, he would get
the shock of his life when he proceeded to read
some of the leading English publications of to-day.
With a large proportion of the upper and middle
classes, the Graphic, for example, is regarded
almost as reverentially as the Bible. Twenty
years ago this big weekly would have laughed the
laugh of A. Peacock at any proposal to depart
from the principles of Cobden, and would have
asked, indignantly, what England was coming to?
But, in its issue of February 6, this same news-
paper had a full page of scare-pictures, with
headings like these -
AN OBJECT-LESSON IN FREETRADE.
A Great British Contract that Went to Germany.
How a £109,000 Order was Lost to our Workers.
The story is an interesting one from many aspects,
and it is exactly the same sort of story, and
preaches the same truths, as several that have
appeared in The Bulletin of recent years. This
is it: —
The Loch Leven power company, of Scotland, wanted
10,000 yards of welded steel pipes, 30in. in diameter and
in 20ft. lengths. Tenders were called, and were received
from both German and English firms. The German ten-
der was slightly under that of the English firm, and was
accepted. The accepted tender amounted to £109,000.
Commenting on the transaction, the English firm
which was unsuccessful (Thos. PiGGOTT and Co.,
of Birmingham) state: “It makes us wonder
whether there may not be something in Tariff
refprm after all.” And the Graphic mournfully
adds :
What can one say of the deal, except that it resulted
in £109,000 leaving this country for Silesia (where the
German manufacturers are), when, if the same fiscal
policy were pursued here as in Germany, we should have
made these pipes in England ; and of the money paid for
them, say £25,000, or a quarter, would have gone in
wages to the working-man? As it turns out, 5 per cent.,
or some such figure, is saved by the Power company, and
95 per cent, is lost to us. This short object-lesson goes
largely to explain why there is so much unemployment
in this country, and why the British working-man, who
was, till recent years, recognised as an aristocrat among
the working classes, is to-day becoming a pariah in the
world of industry.
It is ail an incredible sort of thing; and nothing
but the bald, actual facts serve to make the
reader sure that he isn’t reading a romance.
Britain is just now straining every nerve to hold
its naval supremacy against Germany ; and it
calmly gives a £109,000 order for work, and good,
payable work, to the very nation it is competing
with, so that there may be more money in Ger-
many with which to build great ironclads for the
conquest of Britain. There is nothing more
topsy-turvy in the crazy Wonderland invented by
Lewis Carroll.

The Unspeakable Turk.
It seems to be mere waste of effort to put the new
wine of Parliamentary Government into the old,
immemorial bottle of Asia. The bottle was never
built for that kind of liquor. Japan, it is
true, struggles along with a comic-opera Parlia-
ment, but the Jap Legislature apparently sur-
vives for two special reasons : (1) hardly anybody
has a vote; (2) the august and deliberative
Monkey has no real power, the influence of the
Emperor being sufficient to decide the course of
events when the alleged law-making body threatens
to uplift its tail with a show of independence.
Persia had a Parliament for a day; then it had mur-
der and massacre ; now it has bitter and ferocious
civil war. Turkey has its second Parliament on
hand ; the first one met precariously in 1877, and
hurst in 1878. The new Turkish Parliament has
just assembled, and already a mutinous army,
doubtless sooled on by Abdul the Damned, has
been howling at its door, and another army has
come to its rescue, and it only lives by aid of the
friendly violence of armed men outside. This
Turkish Legislature was the product of the great
revolution engineered by the Committee of Union
and Progress, and it is really only the shadow
of the Committee and the Committee’s soldiery.
A section of the army- joined the revolu-
tion, for the army was ill-fed, its pay was so
far behind that even if the forces had marched
back to meet their arrears their boots would
have given out before they arrived ; and the
officers were shabby and disreputable from
sheer poverty—this while Abdul Hamid blewed
about £7,000,000 a year on his personal expenses.
When the troops rose, Abdul climbed down so
swiftly that he dropped the last 20ft. and con-
cussed himself severely. The bruise is still visible
when Abdul is in the nude. The worst tyrant
on earth became an ardent reformer. In fact, he
reformed so violently that he was almost qualified
to be a member of the Labor party. For a time
Europe took this Labor Sultan quite seriously,
and reckoned that even the incurable House of
Othman had reformed. Then while the Turkish
Parliament was busy wrestling with the intrica-
cies of its foolish job, the imperial wild animal
rushed out of his cage with a large piece of raw
meat in his mouth, and the counter-revolution
commenced. There was a horrible slaughter
of officers attached to the Reform party,
and the usual huge massacres of Christians started
in Asia Minor. The bush or outlying Turk always
massacres a lot of Christians when he gets any
surprising news from the capital. If the news is
good, he butchers many Christians ; if it is indif-
ferent, he slaughters more Christians ; if it is
bad, he wipes out most Christians. But Abdul
seemingly miscalculated his strength. To-day,
the Committee of Union and Progress seems to
be again on top, and the Parliament still lives,
and Reform is still in full blast, and the
Sultan appears to be virtually a prisoner. But
he has been allowed to live and, at time
of writing, to retain his throne—a pro-
posal to replace him by his brother, a feeble,
elderly person, blighted by 30 years’ confinement,
fell through—and anything is possible while
Abdul the Damned lives and remains on deck.
The Committee of Union and Progress might
have made things secure if it had wiped
out the House of Othman, root and branch,
man, woman and child, even to its most
distant relative, but nothing short of that is likely
to bring about permanent regeneration in Turkey.
The tyranny which certain “Christian” Powers
so long propped up at Constantinople was a fear-
some thing. Abdul Hamid was almost a world’s
record for tyranny, faithlessness, suspicion, great
villainies and petty persecution, wholesale and
retail murder, torture, extortion, and all the
other known sins. By comparison with him
the Duke of Alva was a fairly good Christian,
and Nero was something above the average. Some
day, perhaps, Europe will present this monster
of iniquity with his portrait, done in boiling oils, as
a faint expression of its views concerning him.
Yet 31 years ago Britain took a stupendous
war hazard for the purpose of propping up Abdul
Hamid’s power; those were the days when
Benjamin, the Horrible Hebrew, was Prime
Minister, and under his guidance Britain accepted
Cyprus as a bribe, and in return it saved Mace-
donia to the Sultan—in consequence of which
some hundreds of thousands of butchered folk lie
dead at Britain’s door—and then Benjamin the
Bought came back to London, and waved his plug
hat at the multitude, and said that he had brought
peace with honor. And Britain has propped up
Abdul ever since, and talked a good deal about
his possible reformation. There are rumors that
even the Devil has an occasional inclination to
mend his ways and become a respectable house-
holder, and possibly rise to the dignity of church-
warden ; but no such report has ever circulated as
regards the curious Iniquity who climbed over a
corpse and a lunatic to attain the Sultan’s billet,
and who has been climbing over corpses ever
since. And many of these corpses—the remains
of suspected reformers who had died horribly
after days and weeks of torture—were dreadful to
look upon. The sight of them was calculated to
put even a strong man off his food.for a week.

“Australian” writes: According to S. M.
Herald (20/4/’O9), one Coulls, delegate from the
Barrier (N.S.W.) branch of the A.M. A. to the
recent Sydney Labor Congress, spoke thus con-
cerning universal military service :
When this country becomes fit to defend I will be pre-
pared to defend it. I’d sooner be shot in the back than
be compelled to defend it as it is. My troubles if any
nation comes to Australia, to capture it. I don’t care
even if the Japanese take it. That is because we couldn’t
live under worse conditions if any other country owned
Australia (dissent). I repeat that this country has not
treated me so well that I am going to take up arms to
defend it.
It is indeed a grievous pity that the Barrier
miners allow themselves to be misrepresented by
persons of the T. Mann and Coulls species. The
individual who is willing, as Coulls professes to
be, that bis wife and daughters, and his mates’
wives and daughters, should become the play-
things of a horde of conquering Asiatics seems
hardly human. He may be a man, but the evidence
is all to the contrary. And there issomething pathet-
ically ignorant and childish about the cry of the
individual who says that conquest doesn’t matter,
for “we couldn’t live under worse conditions”
than in Australia. Broken Hill may be bad
enough, but it is hardly even the top storey of
Hell; there are plenty of possible conquerors
whose rule would make a man speedily regret
that he hadn’t died in the last ditch, even in
defence of a galvanised-iron, drought-stricken
shanty at the Barrier. The people of N.S.W.,
and in a Federal sense the people of Australia,
have complete self-government, and the only
possible meaning of the Coulls attitude is that
self-government is a failure now, and is always
going to be a failure, and that a foreign auto-
cracy is preferable. It is a lamentable attitude,
and for the credit of the Labor movement it is a
pity that Mr. Coulls wasn’t immediately pre-
sented with his railway ticket for home, and
urged to take his pro-Jap opinions off the
premises, and informed that a white man’s union
could do without him in future.
The Yictorian Public Accounts Committee
has reported, in effect, that Thomas Bent got his
dissolution of Parliament last year by falsehood,
inasmuch as the Governor granted the dissolution
o.n Bent’s assurance that he had enough money to
carry on with, and the said Bent hadn’t enough
money. Bent says he gave the assurance under
the impression that he could lawfully use certain
cash balances, and the Committee says almost in
so many words that it doesn’t believe him.
Therefore, the Committee recommends that any
future Minister who follows in Bent’s huge foot-
steps should be disqualified for life from holding
office, and that any officer who signs orders for
payments not authorised by Parliament, as Bent’s
officer did at Bent’s instigation, should be liable
to gaol. Meanwhile, it seems that nothing is
going to happen to Bent.

“ In the Ranks ” was revived at Sydney
Palace last Saturday night. Either the play has
changed or the writer has undergone an alteration
since he first saw it at London Adelphi a matter
of 15 years ago. Then it seemed to him a faithful
reproduction of contemporary life. To-day this—
the masterpiece of G. R. Sims—fails to stir in him
one responsive chord. It has been modernised
and otherwise hacked about by the present pro-
ducer and his fellow-actors. Many a superfluous
jest and banal patriotic outburst is there that was
not there before. But, anyhow, the drama is a
poor one, acceptable only to extreme youth or
ultra-Dreadnoughtism.
Ned Drayton is militantly upright, despite
the fact that his father was a forger. Colonel
Wynter, rich and good-hearted but obtuse to the
verge of idiocy, is Ned’s guardian and benefactor.
He quarrels with Ned over the latter’s resolve to
marry Ruth Herrick. This is where Gideon
Blake, villain, comes in. Later, Gideon walks
off arm-in-arm with the Colonel, and Ned’s
chances of inheriting the aged soldier’s estates
retire to an outside price in the betting. Enter
Richard Belton, a bald-headed tramp, who claims
to be Ned’s father, and “ proves it” by producing
a letter (picked up “in Australia”) in the hand-
writing of Ned’s deceased mother. Ned reels at
great length with horror, and arranges to meet
his awful-looking and bogus parent in Dingley
Wood that night. As it happens, a band of
poachers has arranged to operate in Dingley
Wood at the time specified. An oppor-
tunity is afforded the management to pre-
sent a picture of poaching as practised in the
Cold Country. The poachers slink on with
Lee-Metford rifles, and reconnoitre nervously.
They then retire out of sight and proceed to poach.
Ear-splitting detonations are heard, followed by
the crashing to earth of heavy objects—pre-
sumably pheasants, but apparently condors by
the noise. It suggests to the onlooker
that Britain’s poaching system is on a
par with its fiscal one. Colonel Wynter,
owner of the bombarded poultry, appears. Belton
follows, and, with the only bona-fide fowling-
piece in the company, shoots the Colonel in the
neighborhood of the midriff. As the old man lies
weltering behind a stump, Ned steps forward and
hands Belton a bundle of notes. Even as the
stakes change hands Gideon Blake arrives, and
accuses the totally innocent Ned of instigating
the assassination of his benefactor. And so Ned
gets six months for assault, and emerges from
gaol a disgraced man, and is, in consequence,
driven to take the shilling and begin life
anew as a “ranker.” Act 111. presents
Ruth’s lodgings. Ruth has married Ned prior
to his trouble, and is shown expiating her foolish-
ness in the all-black garb of penury. Belton —
still bald—blows in, borrows a sovereign, departs,
returns very drunk, drugs Ruth’s tea, and is leav-
ing when Gideon eventuates. Belton confides to
Gideon that he (Belton) is not really Ned’s father.
Gideon hardly has time to observe “Ha!” or
words to that effect, when Ruth, who has heard
all, totters up-stage, and in a doped tone of voice
says “Thank God ! ” Belton straightway falls on
her, but hereabouts Ned dashes in. The rest of
the play is mitigated by a stirring scrap under
scratcb-as-cats-can rules between Ned and Gideon,
during which the combatants rollsix times towards
the O.P. wings, and then reverse and roll six
times in the Prompt direction ; also, by an escape
from a guard-room, and by alarms and excursions
in a barrack square. The end of Act Y. allures
the entire company to the lodgings of Ruth. The
first to materialise is Ned, fresh from the barrack
cells, and obsessed with a characteristically insane
project of fleeing the country with Ruth. Gideon
is the next entrant. While threatening Ned with
divers penalties, he is confounded by the appear-
ance of the Colonel, looking fit and well in a frock-
coat and gibus bat. Hardly has the Colonel
finished tongue-lashing Gideon when the British
army surges into the room. The captain of it is
all for Ned. He mentions that the latter’s dis-
charge has been bought. “ But,” he adds warmly,
“You are too good a man to be lost to the ser-
vice. I hope to grasp your hand shortly in the
capacity of a fellow-officer.” Enthusiasm runs
high as the Colonel notifies that he has “ used his
influence” (in some direction unspecified), and
that, as a result, Ned will be given a commission
immediately.

Ifc is hard to say a kindly and at the same
time honest word concerning the acting in this
play. The two characters that most nearly
resemble human beings are the Captain Holcroft
of J. L. Lawrence and the Barbara Herrick of
Miss Rosemary Rees. George Cross (Ned Dray-
ton) and Miss Ada Guildford (Ruth) win applause
in virtuous rhles. The Gideon Blake of Wilton
Power is an undesirable whom we have met before
in a similar environment, and the same remark
applies to the Belton of Johnson Weir. As Joe
Buzzard, Wilton Welch supplies a mass of per-
fectly lamentable comic relief. Miss Maud Chet-
wynd is quaint as Mrs. Timmany, and others of the
minor characters are diverting.

Sydney Palace, on Saturday afternoon,
May 1, sees the first performance by the Play-
goers’ Club, of a new Australian play by J. 0. Lee,
entitled “Out on the Oastlereagh.” There is an
agreeable suggestion of the vast wilderness in the
title; and if the comedy-drama lives up to its
name, it should be a fair-sized success. The box
plan is open at Paling’s.

Time is rubbing the pristine gloss off “ An
Englishman’s Home” at Sydney Royal, and
in another ten days the building will be dis-
mantled and removed to Melbourne. Mean-
while, the shells of the foreigners remain in good
bursting order, and Mr. Brown continues to go
mad, and engage, on his own, the entire invading
army, amidst loud applause; nor do the British
volunteers omit to turn up opportunely in the
last act, and delight all but chronic Dingoes by
pointing their rifles at Prince Yoland and his
minions, thus conclusively proving the truth of
the old adage that Britons never shall be slaves.
Those who don’t want to be utterly out of the
conversational hunt at suburban tea-rallies during
the next few weeks will struggle forward and
view this play ere yet it is too late.
*# * *
A “curtain-raiser” is being rehearsed at
Sydney Royal. This is a brand of play that has
fallen into disuse here of late years. It is
a necessity in London, where food comes first
and the drama a bad second ; and stalls
and dress circle frequenters don’t start dinner
till the hour the average Australian play begins.
It has become a temporary necessity in this city
owing to the short dramatic measure that is sup-
plied by “An Englishman’s Home.” The public
has started muttering that it isn’t getting full
value for its money in this brief work, and when
the public takes that attitude it is as advisable
for a theatrical manager to placate it as it is for
the wanderer on the steppes of Russia to throw
his creditor (provided the latter is handy) to the
wolves that pervade those snow-clad regions.
* X st?
“10-2-4”: Sydney Telegraph, in a
second notice of “An Englishman’s Home,”
uses these uninformed words :
The extraordinary antics of the volunteer company
excite unrestrained mirth. The fact is, as has been
already pointed out, that the author has mistaken
caricature for satire, and has in consequence overshot the
mark. If, as has been urged, he meant to emphasise a
system of incompetency in drawing this picture, he has
ignored an elementary principle of dramatic art—namely,
that in aiming the barbed shaft of satire one should not
distort facts. This is a plain rule of controversy. The
British volunteer company at the Theatre Royal is merely
a group of helpless idiots w'ho cause derisive laughter.
There has surely been plenty of room for satirical com.
ment in the muddle of the British military operations,
as exemplified in the South African war, for instance,
without any necessity to rush wildly to the other extreme.
Such a caricature as Major du Maurier has contrived in
this scene of “An Englishman’s Home” might be all right
if the piece were burlesque, but, unfortunately, given a
place in serious drama, it detracts, to some extent, from
the value of the lesson he very properly wishes to convey.
To anyone who has met the British volunteer
personally, du Maurier’s picture appeals as in no
way overdrawn. It was accepted in England,
and it is still being accepted there, as a faithful
representation of a widely-known type. The
writer knew intimately, during three years
which he spent “eating dinners” at the
Inner Temple, London, members of a legal
(and therefore, presumably, more than ordinarily
brainy) brigade of volunteers. They were
capable enough at their own job which
was the law. But in the capacity of handy
men out of doors they were every whit as hope-
less as Captain Finch’s warriors now showing at
Sydney Royal. Two of these legal volunteers
stayed in the same house with me in the country
once. I found in the course of three days that
they could not harness a horse, and, in fact, were
hopelessly bewildered when faced with the
problem of putting a bridle on the animal’s head.
Neither of them had ever slept in the open in his
life. Neither was competent to cook a chop, to
build a presentable fire, to ride the quietest hack,
or to kill flesh, fish or fowl, unless the same
stepped forward, held out its head, and fairly
clamored for the happy despatch. This state of
things is pretty well universal among young men
of the British “middle class ” —the class, that is,
from which the volunteer must needs be drawn.
There is no analogy between his type and the
Australian, for the reason that practically every
Australian, no matter what his position in life,
habitually leads the out-door existence which
alone can give the non-regular soldier that self-
reliance which is required in the essentially out-
door game of war. Prominent Englishmen don’t
hesitate to acknowledge the utter uselessness of
the volunteer system. For example, an issue
of the London Daily Mail to hand last week
contained this: —
An influential meeting of the employers of London,
held at Harrods’ Stores yesterday, in support of the Terri-
torial Army movement, was enlivened by one or two
entertaining stories.
“ I am an old Volunteer," said Sir Melvill Beachcroft,
the chairman of the London County Council; “and I
have seen active service. The Fenian scare was on. I,
with some others, was set to protect the armory at Wool-
wich, on which the Fenians were supposed to have
designs. I had a rifle and several rounds of ball cart-
ridge.
“On a hedge near-by I espied the figure of a man. I
challenged him. No reply. I challenged him again.
Still no reply. I fired. The bullet grazed his cheek. He
got up then—and I saw that it was my captain, come to
see if I was doing my duty. Those "(added Sir Melvill,
provoking a roar of delighted laughter) “ were days of
enthusiasm in the Volunteer cause !"
Sir Edward Clarke, K.C., also became autobiographical.
“For twenty years I was in the Volunteers. I was
always a full private, more or less efficient. We went for
long marches, principally by train, to Wimbledon Com-
mon, and we fought sham fights at Nevvhaven. Although
we had our uses, I should not like to claim that we were
efficient according to modern notions.”
The British regular is still, in all likelihood, as
good a soldier as ever he was (which is to say he
is a very good soldier indeed) ; but the volunteer
is a howling joke, pure and simple ; and none but
papers like the Telegraph, which haven’t met
him, and live 12,000 miles distant from his
idiocies, dream of saying otherwise.

At Her Majesty’s (Sydney) “ Jack and
Jill ” still persist in their unscientific quest of
the element which is so scarce at the Canberra
capital site. In most places where people have to
go up hills and to other remote spots after water
typhoid is prevalent. Not so at Her Majesty’s.
Patrons will be glad to know that this resort has
a clean bill of health. Furthermore, the home of
Jack and Jill is a veritable riot of song and dance,
and leg and color and assault-and-battery humor.
“ Jack and Jill ” and the place they inhabit are
circumstances that should be encountered by all
citizens, other than Methody divines and deaf
and blind subjects, not once merely, but several
times.

Public interest; in the doings of “ The
Hypocrites,” at Sydney Criterion, does not wane.
The show has been running a month, and play-
goers still crowd to it in shoals, platoons and the
like, and indicate their approval in the usual
manner. An encouraging sign this, for indeed,
take it for all in all, “The Hypocrites” is about
the worthiest and best-acted dramatic effort that
Sydney has been offered in recent years..

The motor-theatrical-tour is a new thing: in England.
H. A. Jones’ play, “ Dolly Reforming Herself,” is running
round the “ provinces,” the whole company being carried
in a motor saloon car. Only one performance is given at
each town ; then the motor says “ toot,” and the show
hurries on its way with hope in front and a smell behind.
The Bulletin lias been sent an advance copy of
the Official Year Book of Australia for 1909. An
amazinv amount of valuable information is crammed into
its 1100 > and odd pages. Statistics are furnished for the
whole period of Australian settlement, viz., from 1788 to
190 S ; and for the years since Federation (1901-1908), de-
tailed figures are provided. Special articles deal well and
interestingly with such urgent subjects as the exploration
of Australia, the development of Australia’s trade with
Asia, the Customs tariff, and many more that the person in
the street and business house and office wants to have made
available in a form that admits of prompt reference.
There are ways in which this Year. Book stands head and
shoulders above any similar production in the world to-
day. Neither the United States nor the United Kingdom
possess such a work, and their statistics have to be chased
through a multitude of volumes. In some cases, too, the
chase is quite fruitless. For instance, so slipshod are the
statistics of the United States that there is no official
record of births, marriages and deaths for the whole
country, and the population estimates, except in the
census year, are mere guesswork. In fact, outside Aus-
tralia Private Enterprise mostly supplies the different
nations with the hard facts about themselves that they
need to know. This Australian Year Book is a sample of
what an enlightened up-to-date Government can do in
that line, and a better advertisement for Socialism could
hardly be imagined.*

Playgoers who are particular about the
quality of the goods are promised something up
to professional standard at Sydney Criterion to-
morrow in the matinee performance of Rostand s
famous play, “ The Fantasticks,” by the Sydney
Stage Society. Madge Mclntosh, who will play
Sylvette, created the part on the London premiere
of this romantic and humorous work. Special
attention is being paid to the accessories of music
and effects, upon which the atmosphere of this

The Welsh Male Choristers are going
melodiously and financially well through a
second season at Sydney Centenary Hall. The
units of this musical army are trained to a finish,
and the gentleman with the taffyish name of
William Thomas, who is responsible for their
unity and discipline, deserves medals on his chest.
Taffyland’s National Anthem, “The March of
the Men of Harlech,” part songs and popular
gems from operas, put the choristers and audience
on good terms at Saturday’s opening concert. A
change of programme nightly adds to the attract-
iveness of the season. Paling’s display the plan
for taking advantageous positions.

Bengough, the Canadian cartoonist, will
open his Sydney season at Sydney Centenary
Hall, York-street, on May Ist. Bengough is
said to combine rapidity of work with startling
realism, and to have the saving grace of humor (a
thing most cartoonists are woefully deficient in)
largely developed. His entertainment will con-
sist of a lecturette on “The Artfulness of Things
in General,” illustrated with playful sketches
that will show the advantage of possessing the
open eye in order to realise the unsuspected fun
that lurks in mathematics and other dry subjects.
Altogether, according to the advertisement,
Bengough is an entertainer out of the general
class of sketch artists.

Miss Millie Hughes, a soprano bird whose
warble is being trained by Mr. George Grimm,
will vocalise for the public on Friday next (April
30) at the Sydney Y.M.C. A. Hall. A group of
well-known artists will assist. Plan at Paling’s.
Also, and furthermore, Mr. Vincenzio de
Giorgio is a pianist of note who has
recently come to reside in Sydney. As a
foreblast of moderate fanfare he will give an
invitation musical recital on Thursday evening
next in the Y.M.C.A. Hall. His biggest piano
morsel will be Beethoven’s gigantic concerto in
C minor. Likewise, to continue the list of musi-
cal events, Slapoffski’s operatic proceedings are
coming along, and Sydney will shortly be treated
to a handsome production of Verdi’s tragic “Aida”
and Don zetti’s wailingly romantic “Lucia,” in
the Town Hall. Mrs. Slap, heads the women solo-
ists, and Andrew Black and Orme Darvall the male
contingent. These grand operas, with a chorus
of 200 and orchestra of 60, will be more than a
novelty to Sydney.

Wirfch I3ros.’ Circus is still booming along
in George-street West (Sydney), and ringing fre-
quent changes of programme on its patrons. It
takes a lot of ingenuity to show the lion and the
tiger and the bear in new r6les, but somehow the
thing is done. .Recently there was an unre-
hearsed comedy act (from the standpoint of
the bear and not the elephant). The useful
Indian beast of burden was standing with
his coat-tail brushing against the bear’s
cage, and his appendage waved gently to the
rhythm of the band. The bear became
interested. He protruded one soft paw, and,
catching the tail on the swing, gently drew it
into the cage, examined it, and then tried a bite.
A scream of anguish,from the elephant did not dis-
turb him. He purred soothingly, and went for the
tail still more. Apparently an elephant’s tail is a
tender part* and during the few minutes that
elapsed before the hot iron was applied to the
bear’s nose to make him release his hold, he made
quite a course. Now that elephant appears
with his tail in a sling; and the night writer
was there he heard one wise bumpkin explain-
ing to another bumpkin who was not so wise that
that was the spot where the ivory grew ; and he
bitterly denounced the cruelty and rapacity
of the Wirths for extracting ivory from
the living elephant. One of the finest circus
turns writer has ever seen is the “Diavolo”
musical act. The bull fight has been worked up
to a high pitch of perfection ; and the spectacle of
the small dog that, done up like a bull, tries to
bellow like one before he charges the trembling
toreador is a sight never to be forgotten. As
said before, the circus is quite up to the high
standard set by its proprietors. The only thing
that is not up to the standard is the band. It
has an imported sound about it.

Chung Ling Soo still holds the centre of
the Sydney Tivoli stage, and the rest of the shovy

On seeing “The Sign of the Cross ” for
the nth time—it has been running for a profitable
week at Adelaide Royal—one is struck most by
the skill with which the author has presented the
character of Mercia. She is not on at all in five
of the play’s 10 scenes. She is talked about much
more than she talks ; it must be One of the easiest
leading-lady parts on record—to learn. Yet it is
only on analysis that this is discovered, for she
seems to pervade the play, and fairly shares its
interest with Marcus, who has the centre of the
stage in eight scenes. In a strong cast perhaps
the most notable are Winter Hall—a fine
Moorish-looking Tigellinus—and Percy Walshe,
who makes Nero more of a Caesar and less of
a derelict from the Inebriate Retreat than is
usual. As for Julius Knight, he is always sound
and commanding. One takes him for granted,
which is, after all, the highest compliment. In
the Martin Harvey cavalier-drama, “ The Breed
of the Treshams,” he has another big chance as a
rather battered Bad-Man-with-some-good-in-him-
after-all—easily the most popular type of charac-
ter in fiction or drama. The Cherniavskis are
again at the Town Hall. They are fine musicians,
and even their affectations give pleasure to a
large section of the public, and pfesumably to
themselves; so why complain ? At the Tivoli,
two Japanese experts are showing (to adapt
Ichabod Bronson) what wrestling would look like
if it didn’t look like the way it does look.
“Diana of Dobson’s,” produced at Her
Majesty’s on Saturday, is both new and fresh to
Melbourne. Of manyromanticcomedies of English
“class” life and London senciment, which have,
or haven’t flourished in the foreign atmosphere of
Australian theatres, “ Diana ” is perhaps the most
originally and whimsically humorous. Also, in
the humor of its romance and socialistic sugges-
tions, it is charmingly feminine. It is the work of
an authoress (Cicely Hamilton) who is a practical
suffragette, and a student of shop-girl character
in a city where the term “sleeping in
is generally understood, and “sleeping out” is
a recognised penalty of poverty. Apart from
Diana, the first act presents five different types
of sleepers-in at Dobson’s, and although they aie
not all of them as convincingly presented as they
were in London under Lena Ashwell’s manage-
ment —the writer speaks from personal recollec-
tion of the scene—and the girl in the pmk
“nighty” doesn’t rise from her undergarments on
her bed as she did at the Kingsway Theatre, and
the exceeding width of the stage weakens the
illusion, the first act of “ Diana ” at Her Majesty’s
is nevertheless a very forcible piece of feminine
low comedy which sets the house roaring. It was
characteristic of the woman playwright that her
first care was to give the boys a treat in a picture
of girly dormitory life. In the Melbourne per-
formance of this scene the best sample of typemg
is submitted by Miss Edith Lewis as Miss
Smithers.
* * * *
The plot of the comedy is outlined in the
foregoing jingle. The entertainment is mostly in
the light didactic dialogue, and the three contrast-
ing phases of the extraordinary Diana rather
mar the characterisation. Only two persons beside
Victor Bretherton are seriously concerned with
the career of Diana during her fleeting hour of
luxury in Switzerland. Mrs. Brough, who
got a great welcome on Saturday, plays the
orthodox matchmaking matron with more
ease than subtlety; whilst Gregan McMahon
cleverly gives an air of truth to his
sketch' of the familiar titled shopkeeper and
vulgarian, a character that is commonly played on
extreme farcical lines. Thomas Kingston is the
chappie who suffers the rude awakening, and
changes from a professional fortune-hunter into
an amateur “ cab-chaser.” His is a likeable,
though feeble performance, marred in its effect by
an atrocious tweed suit. The plot demands that
he shall be chappily tailored for the enchantment
of the supposed widow, yet the suit he urges
must strike her as being worth about o2s. bd., in-
cluding an extra pair of pants. As regards
clothes, Miss Brune also is somewhat at fault m
the final scene, where her.outfit suggests that
she might have paid another week s ren.t
with it before getting ejected from her
lodging. Otherwise her playing of Diana—the
very British antithesis of “ Sunday ” and “ The
Girl of the Golden West ” —is a revelation of un-
expected restraint in the acting of Miss Tittell
Brune. True, she could do with a further in-
fusion of reposeful manner, nor is she less artificial
than usual in her lapses into sentimentality, nor
does she even nearly attain the dramatic height
of a Lena Ashwell when she scorns her Gussie,
but she is often remarkably effective in situations
where a keen dramatic sense of the character is
as necessary as a talent for stage business. Alto-
gether “ Diana of Dobson’s ” is a most interesting
show.

At Melbourne Princess’s, “Sweet Kitty
Bellairs” still pursues the sunlit path of effective
rendition and elegant drapery; and, as antici-
pated, is proving a most effec-
tive medium for the Nellie
Stewart boom which play-
goers could feel was in the
air. It is here now. The
Old World atmosphere of
beautiful but wicked
Bath, and the gorgeous
clothes thereof, have
taken quite 20 years off
the age of Melbourne’s
old favorite; and the
playgoer who sees her
after long separation,
arrives there to find
himself back in an at-
mosphere of long ago.
The atmosphere of long
ago is always effective
when it is set off by
good clothes and an
artist of Nellie Stewart’s
consummate skill. The
play may not be truth-
ful, and may make holes
in the history of morals ;
but that doesn’t matter.
It creates an atmosphere
of charm and beauty,
which should be the chief
end of all drama.

putting a streak of horror into his bellovvdramas,
and The Bulletin would suggest that when the
last week arrives the drama should be improved
more in accordance with the actual facts of the case.
Two fine, spectacular scenes might be introduced.
One would be Lady Hamilton’s well-known night
dance on the inverted punchbowl, with Nelson,
full to the neck of the original contents of the
bowl, gazing admiringly, as he used to do, through
the clouds of tobacco smoke at the rather plump
dancer, who was usually garbed only in her hair for
that act. The other tableau might represent that
weird scene in which the dead bodies of the
butchered Neapolitan patriots followed in the
wake of Nelson’s flagship, and nearly drove that
cold, determined man to drink. Altogether, it
seems to the writer that the author of “ The
Mariners of England ” has not made as much as
he might of such excellent material.

Mrs. Melba has cut Masterton out of her

that it is quite No-Licence and wholly public-
houseless, and if the soprano went there she

covery of a “remarkable contralto at Stewart’s

DIANA OF DOBSON’S.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Among 1 the slaves at Dobson’s (“ cutting ” draper, he, and
sweater)
Who slept upon the premises in dormitories bleak
Was Miss Diana Massingberd, who dreamed of something
better
Than a dreary life of toiling hard for two half-crowns a
week.
Now there came to Miss Diana in the ordinary manner
A formal lawyer’s letter, then she tilted high her chin,
And her world grew bright and sunny, and it flowed with
milk and honey,
For she’d got a bit of money, and a mind to “do it in.”
She bought some pretty dresses, like the folk of rank and
fashion,
Did Diana (late of Dobson’s) when she passed a month
abroad
As a wealthy widow lady ; and she raised a tender passion
In the heart of Victor Bretherton, the offspring of a
lord.
But when the month was ended, and her money all
expended,
And she told the languid chappie that she wasn’t worth
a cent,
He was glad he’d not embrac’t her, so she scorned him as
a waster,
And, mockingat his weakness, back to poverty she went.
Then Victor, thinking sadly of the girl who spoofed him
gladly,
Formed a sudden resolution to go working for a while,
With the hope that he might show her—for he loved
Diana badly—
That a toff can earn his living in a common manly style.
But he rarely earned a tanner ; it was even as Diana
Had assured him ere they parted at the Engadine Hotel.
On a bench by London’s river, where the night wind sent
a shiver
Through his liver, he was dozing when a funny thing
befell.
Diana, faint and footsore, came and roosted there beside
him ;
They recognised each other, and the bitter truth he toid
That he couldn’t earn a living ; but she didn’t now deride
him,
She let him squeeze her gently, for the night was verj T
cold.
He discussed his “ paltry income’’from the standpoint
of the gutter,
Though to marry not for money he had formerly been
loth ;
And her heart began to flutter when she heard her hero
mutter :
“Six hundred pounds per annum will suffice to keep
us both.”
With a bob the “copper” lent him, Victor bought some
bread and butter ;
O’er a loving cup of coffee, from the stall, they plighted
troth.
“A very far-fetched story,” says the critical fault-finder.
“ A comedy of morals,” says the writer of this rhyme.
If the rebel woman toiler left her wretchedness behind
her,
And played at wasting money for a gorgeous little time,
She was wiser in her folly than the creatures melancholy
Who slave and save their pennies till their sordid
course is run.
In the dull and cheerless present one may distil odors
pleasant
From the treasured recollection of a gambol in the sun.
And the idle, feeble chappie, with a chappie’s one am-
bition :
Shut out from honest sympathy for such as earn their
bread:
He learns from Miss Diana that a man in his position
Isn’t bound to be dependent on the woman he may wed.
There is matter in the story for each Democrat and Tory
Of ordinary intellect to swallow and digest—
For the sinner and the kirker, and the waster and the
worker —
In this tale of how Diana “ blewed ” three-hundred of
the best.
VICTORIA.
O.K.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ Sceneshifter” : “An Englishman’s Home,” if it does
nothing else, cruelly caricatures the volunteers of old
England. Some years ago (in 1897), when Harry Connor
was here with “ A Trip to Chinatown,” he put up another
piece called “ A Milk White Flag.” It was a very power-
ful satire on the weak points in Uncle Sam’s State militia.
The author, Henry Hoyt, held up to public ridicule the
“ clubbable ” phase of militia life on a strictly peace
footing. It was alleged that men really joined for the
pleasure of belonging to a fast club, and in order to get
among a lot of gamblers and be privileged to live on
fashionable principles in a whirl of cards and decanters.
The gorgeous uniforms, as compared with the plain clo’
of the regular soldiery, were bitterly emphasised, as was
also the amazing preponderance of officers over privates.
In fact, there was only one private, and he was the drink-
waiter. The officers were in scores and hundreds, and the
club had medical certificates ready for the whole lot of
them in case of war, declaring their inability to rush to
the field of battle. They all had fatal diseases, and some
of them had nine diseases. The only individual for whom
no medical certificate was kept ready was the private, or
drink-waiter. When the General presented these troops
with a white flag he told them it was one they should
never desert, “ even on the field of battle.” And they
said they wouldn’t. This cruel satire raised Cain in the
States, but nevertheless the piece was a great money
maker there. The joke was lost on this side of the
Pacific.
“ J.” : “An Englishman’s Home ” moves elsewhere
after next week. It hasn’t boomed in Sydney to any
extent. I think one of the main reasons is that the great
majority in every audience doesn’t understand it. Half
the allusions are caviare to those who haven’t lived in the
Cold Land, and a goodly proportion of the jests are not
accepted as such in this country because they deal with
matters of (to us) ordinary everyday occurrence. Take,
for instance, the familiar relations that are shown to exist
between volunteer Captain Finch and his men. That
would be regarded as screamingly funny in England, Ger-
many or Austria, where service discipline causes the officer
and the private to stand on different planes. Here where,
for the most part, no such distinction exists, the onlooker
finds it hard to grasp what the dramatist is driving at.
The satire contained in the mania of Geoff, and his.
friends for “ sport ” cuts no ice amongst us. Ninety per
cent, of Sydney playgoers would condemn the man as a
crank, a Socialist, and a speaker of subversive doctrines
who dared to decry cricket, racing or football, and the
amazing local interest that is taken in them. Above all,
Australians can’t accept the perfectly sincere picture du
Maurier has drawn of the British volunteer. They are
unable to believe that this much-boomed warrior is as
incapable as he is painted. Actually one of the
morning dailies ascribed du Maurier’s work in
this regard to the regular soldier’s “jealousy”
of his volunteer brother-in-arms—as who should
talk of Jack Johnson’s “ jealousy ” of the ban-
tam champion of the Undertow Beach Swimming
Club. In searching for a good word to give “An English-
man’s Home” last Saturday, Sydney Telegraph saidl'
“The Sydney audiences are laughing, forgetting that it it
meant to teach a bitter truth. However, Brown’s defend
of Myrtle Villa in the last act captures them, so perhaps
in the long run the play may have a sobering influence
upon the careless, pleasure-seeking Australian.” Surely,
in itself, an awful instance of incomprehension. Brown’s
coat-removing act hits the gallery where it lives, and
thus fulfils the object for which it was introduced ; but it
is the frankest sort of claptrap and humbug. Barring
the above, about the only genuinely rapturous “ hand ”
of the evening occurs when Finch says “ Damn. ’ But
then the tremendous and gratifying effect of the word
“ Damn ” on the stage is sure wherever Shakspeare’s
tongue is spoken.
“ Snell ” : I wish I could sell hams, or jams, or Ameri-
can boots as these theatrical managers can retail their
wares to a humble public. People who wanted to see
Nellie Stewart on April 10 prowled into town in the dark,
damp, drowsy hours of early morning a fortnight pre-
vious and stood sound a Collins-street door like a
drove of intimidated sheep till coupons were dealt
out to them. Then they stood round the door
ao-ain in a second version of the subdued and
simple jumbuck, till permitted to enter and realise on
their coupons. At which point, after hours of weariness
and waiting, about half of them found there was nothing
to realise, because all the sitting, standing and hanging-
on accommodation was already mopped up. Now', if the
public would only fall out of bed to rush for coupons,
enabling it to purchase my splendid poems, “ Crown Svo,
cloth gilt, gilt top, 55.,” it would go far to restore my
faith in the sanity of man.
The Bulletin’s Adelaide dramatic critic writes : “ Har-
rison O.” (in B. 15/4/’O9) has “caught me bending’’—to
use the latest London phrase for getting one in a
dilemma. He quotes with approval my remark that
“ The Girl of the Golden West ” has “ the most unneces-
sary fourth act ever seen on any stage ”; and then he
ones on to describe that act as containing the cowboy
kindergarten scene. But that is the third act at least,
it was ?n Adelaide, and the play is not likely to have been
structurally changed since. It is a long and important
act, foolish as the comic relief part of it may be, and the
play couldn’t exist without it. What I deplored w 7 as the
final act, five minutes of anti-climax, showing the hero
and heroine alone on the plains. “ Harrison O.’s” com-
pliment must therefore be regretfully returned to him.
Meanwhile, let me add to the collection of unnecessary
climaxes the king of them all. It is what naturalists call
a “sport.” It only happened once; still, it happened.
The Julius Knight co. was going to play “ The Darling of
the Gods” in Adelaide, but something went wrong and it
couldn’t be done. Yet the great Apotheosis scenery was
on hand, and it seemed a shame to. waste it. So, after
Marcus and Mercia had gone to the lions, they turned up
again in Cloudland, spectacularly reunited—they who
had never parted, unless they were eaten by different
lions—in a Japanese heaven 1
LINES INSPIRED BY A HORRIBLE RUMOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The continued success of “An Englishman’s Home at
the Theatre Royal, Sydney, has led the J. C. Williamson
management to send Mr. Priestly Morrison, the producer,
to Adelaide, to rehearse the Julius Knight Company for
the piece, which will be played in Perth by that organisa-
tion. Mr. Knight will appear as Brown. —News item.
Ah no ! Not that, my Julius.
Don’t do it, I implore.
Why should you ? Fine “ fat ” parts exist
Everywhere, by the score —
R6les that would give your beauty scope :
They’re to be found galore.
I could not stand your classic face
Rimmed with the whiskerings
That Mr. “Myrtle Villa” Brown
Affects. It anguish brings
To one who holds that you should sport
Not whiskerings, but wings.
I sit and brood how .you will look
If you decide to wear
That dreadful coat which Brown tears off.
His tie, his lack of hair —
And, Julius, the grief I feel
Is more than I can bear.
For years I’ve watched you, sword in hand,
Lay hefty foemen low ;
None fought more recklessly than 3'ou,
None struck a shrewder blow.
And shall those arms, that brain, descend
To learn diabolo ?
Shall you who loomed above the herd
Of mummers on the stage,
So that you seemed like some 3'oung god
Turn callously the page
Of youth’s bright lexicon, and don
The dun, drab garb of age ?
Pray Heaven not 1 There are some things
That set one’s teeth on edge.
(Reid in grave mood or Cook in gay
Are instances); I pledge
My word that you—if you play Brown-
Will do a sacrilege.

SOCIETY
After all, Providence is good—sometimes.
A bright example of this fact was in evidence on
Thursday morning last week, when a ferocious
fire gutted the Post Office stores in George-street,
Sydney. The premises are in practically the
same building as The Bulletin office, and
separated only Il3’ a brick wall, built in alcoves.
The stores were packed with clothing, insulating
material, sealing wax, much stationery, and many
highly inflammable chemicals ; and the four top
storeys of the building were a solid furnace. The
dividing wall in several places cracked under
the influence of the fervid heat; but the
Fire Brigade, with splendid .courage and
fine skill, made a good save, and con-
fined the conflagration to the Post Office stores.
The Bulletin rises to acknowledge its gratitude
to the officers and men. It also rises to thank
other newspapers in Melbourne and Sydney, and
the proprietors of many printing establishments,
who kindly telegraphed and wrote offers of
assistance with regard to publishing the paper and
the magazine. Fortunately, owing to the bright
example above mentioned, and the pluck and skill
of the firemen. The Bulletin and Lone Hand
machinery is intact. The proprietors also thank
the many correspondents who have expressed
their sympathy in this paper’s great loss, and
hasten to assure them that, for the before-
mentioned reasons, there is practically no loss.
All the same, it was as close a dodging of destruc-
tion as any well-regulated family newspaper and
magazine cares for.
REASSURING.
OLD LADY : “If I should insure with your com-
pany and die within a month, what claim
would I have ?”
LIFE INSURANCE CANVASSER : “My dear lady,
insure with our company, and if you drop
dead to-morrow you simply present these
papers at our office, and we pay without a
murmur.”
The Sydney lawyers had good pickings
in the two family Equity suits of the Horderns.
There were four “silks” and three “scuffs”
engaged, besides two firms of the lower branch of
the profession. As the arguments ran into days
the “refreshers” were numerous, besides the big
fee that went with each brief.
Most of the late Camperdown borough,
now absorbed into Sydney municipality, was
originally the historic Grose Farm (the holding of
Thomas Laycock), and the estate of Major
Foveaux. Governor Phillip leased 30 acres to
Major Grose, afterwards Lieutenant-Governor.
That lease extended to the site of Prince
Alfred Hospital. Thomas Laycock obtained
28 a.cres, running up to near St. John’s College.
Major Foveaux’s lease is now in part
occupied by Prince Alfred Hospital. After a
time the leases fell in or were resumed, and the
ground was set apart for an orphanage. The
orphanage authorities bartered it back to the
Crown, whereupon the Crown let it out in 30-acre
blocks for grazing, and on one of these blocks the
genial Dan O’Connor learned, as a barefooted boy,
how to handle sheep and chase cattle.
“G.” : Joe Ward’s munificent offer on
behalf of Maoriland to borrow the money for a
Dreadnought— “or two, if necessary” (frantic
cheers)—which has brought about a straightening-
up of the Civil Service, a feverish casting out of
the Government pumpkinologist, and the retrench-
ment of the Under-secretary for Post Holes, all in
the cause of economy, recalls that the Rainy Isles
have probably put up a record for experts during
the latter years of their financial Bacchanalia. If
anybody had skill in the making of pancakes, and
persistency enough to make himself a nuisance, he
was sure to be absorbed as a specialist in one of the
multifarious departments of the country. There is
a poultry department with experimental stations,
which leave a handsome deficit after paying the sal-
aries of the Professor of Hens, and the Commissioner
for Giblets, who is alleged to have started the wage-
earning game as a snake-charmer. Then there is
a fisheries department which has been dabbling
in fish ova long enough to have every drain-pipe
in the Dominion stocked with sea-serpents. Nor
does Ward’s Dominion lack inspectors of fisheries,
who put on green goggles and dive hundreds of
feet under the sea in pursuit of their duty. More-
over, the amazing place owns a tourist depart-
ment, the functions of whose experts are not to
he spoken of in a serious paper. Even the
primary schools were being converted into kinder-
gartens and hobby-shops and bear-pleasaunces, to
the destruction of the three “R’s”and the en-
ragement of the teachers. And now the want of
money has come down like a wolf on the fold and
a hawk on the fowl-run, and Massey, the leader
of Maoriland’s attenuated Opposition, is able to
crow and flap his wings, and say “ I told yer so.”
Meanwhile the number of departments has been
reduced from 34 to 16, and discharged experts are
spreading like a blight on the land.
* * * *
From a London exchange :
Indignation was the dominant note at the meeting on
Tuesday of the Drapers’ Chamber of Trade, when the
question of the charges made by the Rev. R. J. Campbell
as to the morality of female shop assistants in London,
and more particularly in the West End, was fully
discussed.
Campbell, who is one of those rarities, a tho-
roughly democratic cleric, had stated from the
pulpit as a new and hideous discovery a thing that
most people accept as a truism outside the pulpit—
viz., that a big proportion of shopgirls in the
Cold Land are driven to supplement their scanty
earnings with the (also scanty) wages of sin.
Further, Mr. Campbell said that girls in cer-
tain establishments were “encouraged to go
wrong to earn their livelihood.” No disin-
terested person with experience of London
life will question these two allegations. Two
classes of London millinery establishments
possess girls who have to keep themselves with
what they earn outside legitimate business hours.
The first class is made up of those comparatively
small shops which pay their hands inadequate
wages and close their eyes to what the damsels do
in their leisure moments. The London play-
wright who was responsible for “ Diana of Dob-
son’s,” recently produced here, handled this brand
of business house—albeit gingerly, as was necessary
for presentation before an English-speaking public.
Dobson’s “ young ladies,” who drew ss. a week,
“ less deductions,” weren’t shown in the process of
leading the gay life ; but it would be hard for any
rational person to get away from the view that,
perforce, most of them did lead that sort of life.
There is another class of London shop—the ultra-
“smart” establishriient, where a hat is apt to
cost ten guineas, and a fur stole a hundred or so—
that won’t touch the young lady assistant of
austere virtue with a 40-rod pole. To this estab-
lishment the male citizen of affluence repairs as
frequently as does his female relative. He comes
there to buy gifts and to approve any new female
“ find ” the management may have made. The
papers of the Sporting Times and Winning Post
type, which are faithful reflexes of life as it is
lived in their orbit, teem with merry references
to the girl from So-and-So’s, who visits Brighton
or Ostend from Saturday till Monday by way of
keeping body and spul together. Her wage is
often fairly high—sufficient in many cases to buy
the gloves she wears when off duty. But of
course it isn’t nearly enough to pay for the
state she is expected to keep up for the
credit of the house. The privilege of meeting
that liability appertains to a “gentleman friend,”
or two or three. The “indignation” above-
noted of the Drapers’ Chamber of Trade is flag-
rantly bogus. The drapers have to protest
against Rev. Campbell in order to save their faces
before the section of the public that doesn’t
understand modern business methods, or the
whereforeness of them. But they wear their
tongues in their cheeks even as they are protest-
ing, and the huge majority of Londoners know
it. And the huge majority of drapers know that
they know it.
"TAE BE PREECISE."
THE MACTACISH ( with interest): “ Yon stoukin’s ye're wearin’ are nae the real MacGregor
tartan. Hand up yere fut an’ I'll explain it tae ye.”
About the most down-trodden tribe in the
community—mercantile clerkdom is its only pos-
sible rival —is asserting itself slightly in S.A.,
where a Governesses’ Association is being formed.
The State’s own large staff is not complaining ; it
works pretty hard, but it knows its hours and its
duties. The wail and the kick come from the
household slaves of Mrs. Fatwoman (or Mrs.
Cocky, as the case may be). The incompetent
person, who professes to teach and can’t, will be
weeded out of the association. On the other
hand, there may be some redress at last for the
girl who can teach but can’t do washing; yet,
having hired herself out to do the former, is
bullied into doing the latter as well. But there is
never likely to be any adequate redress for such
cases as one now made public, where a refined
woman was sneered at and blocked in every pos-
sible way when she struck for an occasional bath,
and was compelled to sleep in the same room with
her four charges—two of them heavy snorers—
and all doors and windows closed. The criminal
law makes it impossible to fall adequately on an
employer of that character.
PATRIOTIC ASHFIELD.
What was the use of any toy fleet here (Loud ap-
plause) if the battleships of the Empire were defeated
where the fight. was thickest? (Loud cheers.) Our fleet
could then be beaten at the enemy’s leisure. (Applause.)
The motion was carried amidst a scene of wild enthu-
siasm.—Sydney TELEGRAPH report.
“Three cheers for Stinking Fish! Hip, hip
hooray! Hip, hip,” etcetera.
A movement for supplementing suburban
public libraries with picture galleries has been
started in Melbourne by Charles Atkins.
ex-president of the Australian Chamber of
Manufactures. Prahran is to have a loan
collection of pictures in a room at the Town
Hall, Mi-. Atkins having communicated his
enthusiasm to a number of other local resi-
dents with pictures worth exhibiting. Ihe
collection w ill be arranged by an artist and
introduced to the public in a duly impres-
sive manner, and the inevitable result will be
an all-round municipal rivalry in loan col-
lections if this pioneer display is a popular
success. . In wdiich case, of course, pictures
will be presented and bequeathed as W'ell
as loaned to municipal galleries as time
goes on. Also the unfortunate Australian
artists who pine for want of patronage will,
if they have any commercial instinct, hang
their unsold canvases in the nearest town
hall, instead of practically hiding them front
public view. The artistic section of any
community can be easily enlarged by giving
the people further opportunities to acquite
the habit of discriminating between respec-
table paintings and disreputable oleographs.
Melbourne thus far is mostly lacking m
even the low taste in art, which prompts
the small but hopeful householder to spend
half a crown in an art union. If the subur-
ban town-hall gallery idea should incite
the mayors and corporations to organise
a system of periodical picture raffles it will be
another little blow to unadulterated Philistin-
ism. The spectacle of a dozen fat councillors
coming to blows over the choice of Australian
pictures for their next art union would be
rather improving than otherwise. Their wrang-
ling at present, is wholly confined to questons of
drain pipes and such unaasthetic matters.

My Dear, when Grammar first I learned
(Yet dodged it on the sly),
One Pronoun in my vision burned—
A small, sufficing I.
Love danced across my youthful track,
A god of grace and glee ;
To 1 1 firmly set thy back,
And only yearned for Thee.
Time taught me altruistic lore,
Although in outlines dim ;
And quite enthusAily I swore
To think of Her and Him.
Now, Dear, upstairs, a little cot
Pour chubby limbs d-> fit.
Toe rest of Grammar is forgot—
I do my wmrk for ft.

Every Woman Should Know
That Sir Charles A. Cameron, M.D.,
ex-President of the Royal College of
Surgeons, has testified to the absolute purity
of the materials employed in the manu-
facture of Sunlight Soap, and declares
that he himself uses Sunlight Soap.
What every woman does not know is, that
in common soaps she frequently pays for
adulterations at the prices of oils and fats.
Try Sunlight Soap next wash day, and you
will see that Sir Charles A. Cameron is
right—he should know.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy has proved
itself, times out of number, to be an absolutely
safe and reliable remedy. Analysis has proved
that it contains no narcotics, and experience has
proved its unfailing efficacy in coughs, colds, croup,
influenza, and even in warding off pneumonia.
Doesn’t your common-sense prompt you to pur-
chase a bottle now and keep it in the house for
cases of emergency ? If it doesn’t it should.*
Gentlemen who wish to look smart should
pay a visit to Wild’s Hairdressing Saloon, where
six first-class artists are engaged. The establish-
ment is under Vice-Regal patronage. Address,

New Winter Vests.
CORRECT dressing- this season will include the
popular Knitted Vests, and at present we are
showing a very handsome variety. The
patterns exhibit warm, cheerful tones, and the
material being long-fibred wool will give more than
ordinary wear. The edges are braided, and the
button holes and seams strongly sewn. Each is fitted
with four pockets, the fit is neat without tightness
anywhere, and the general effect is indeed very
handsome. We invite inspection, but, if you cannot
call, we will choose for you with care, and exchange
if not just what you need.

The Deadhorse movement struck a very-
unresponsive audience at Newtown, Sydney. In
the town hall of that big suburb the mayor and
two other people gathered themselves together
one night last week to enthuse. They waited long
and earnestly, and two other people arrived.
Then the mayor closed the meeting, and these
five people went home, and the door slammed.
♦ * * *
It isn’t often a person has reason to re-
joice over being “shot in,” but a Melbourne man
is just now in that mixed condition. The other
day an elderly woman climbed into the box at the
City Court, and swore that the young man in
question, whom she had nursed as a baby and had
known all his days, had violently and shamefully
assaulted her that* day week. It was, she said,
dark at the time of the episode, but she was too
well acquainted with him to make any error. It
seemed a clear case for committal; in fact, the
accused didn’t seem to have a hope. But just then
a constable got up and stated that he had arrested
the youth on another charge early on the day in
question, and that he had passed the evening and
night in the North Melbourne lockup—and the
case collapsed. The assaulted ex-nurse hadn’t
even the manners to apologise.
“ D.” makes a few observations :
I see that Sydney’s returned wanderer, Dr. J. Robert-
son, says that in his travels abroad he found no ferry
services to equal those of Sydney. It makes me think
that this particular medico didn’t look very hard, or else
that, for some obscure reason, he is biassed in this regard.
I have covered a good deal of fluid in my time, and in
doing so have sampled a number of ferry-boats ; and
with a clear conscience I say that, barring the appalling
vessels that ply on the Thames (my acquaintance with them
runs to various trips between London Embankment and
Greenwich), and further barring a proportion of the Seine
(Paris) ferry-boats, there are no more expensive, uncom-
fortable and indifferently-appointed craft to be found
anywhere than those which carry passengers about Port
Jackson. The ideal ferry-boat plies between San Fran-
cisco (U.S.A.) and the towns across the bay. It is about
four times as wide as any similar vessel in Sydney harbor.
The seats are broad and absolutely comfortable. You
may get most modern necessaries, from a boot-shine
upwards, on board. Its cleanliness is amazing ; so is its
speed and absence of smell. Excellent boats are those
which are to be found on the Italian lakes. They supply
good wine, food, etc., at a ridiculously cheap rate.
The memory of provender supplied on a vessel that once
bore me from Como to Bellagio lives in my memory
yet. As to Sydney’s ferry boats, I will defy anyone
to sit for half an hour on their narrow and unyielding
settles and not feel anguished, and inclined for profanity.
They are insanely dear. A penny is about twice too much
for conveying one across the narrow strip of water be-
tween Circular Quay and Milson’s Point. Eightpence as
the price of a trip to Manly and back is extortionate.
These things are proved by the bloated and ridiculous
dividends of the ferry companies, whose monopolies en-
able them to demand what fees they will. As to con-
veniences on board, it is impossible for the mere male to
get so much as a decent wash and brush-up on the most
luxuriously appointed boat in the harbor. As to
cleanliness, the best one can say about the steamers is
that some are cleaner than others. In my view, the craft
plying to North Sydney constitute one of the strongest
arguments in favor of the immediate construction of a
bridge or tunnel between the city and North Shore. Also,
I hold that the sooner the State takes over the contract
of conveving citizens to the more distant harbor suburbs
the better it will be for the said citizens’ comfort and
banking accounts.
That humble individual, John Hop, seems
to be doing his duty by Australia in the matter of
increasing the population. A recent police depu-
tation to Premier Murray mentioned some
remarkable families in the Victorian bobby
force. Sergeant Arthur, of Warrnambool,
gladdened the Premier’s heart by remark-
ing that, though there were only six con-
stables in the potato district, they had
among them 38 children. Senior-Con-
stable O’Loghlen owned up to nine child-
ren, and another copper with a lot of
halfpence was Senior-Constable Brady,
who claimed no less than eleven Australian
natives. Premier Murray was so impressed
with these figures that he promised to see
what he could do about raising the police
salaries all round and handing out more pensions.
The Dead Letter Office has “ been there,”
and it vigorously scoffs at the perky man’s cock-
snreness, and calls out “ Liar” to the growler who
knows well that bad administration in Melbourne
is to blame for all the disappointments at the
letter-delivery windows. In Queensland alone,
last year, no less than 147,359 letters, 16,153 post-
cards, and 53,480 papers found
refuge in the Dead Letter Office.
In the letters and packets money
to the extent of £3816 16s. 3d. was
obtained. The office, having got
inside the envelopes, or read the
“ If not delivered, please return ”
instructions on the outside, was
able to right most of this busi-
ness. But no less than 916 letters,
containing £621, were so vaguely
addressed outside to “ Mr. Smith,
Australia,” or something of the
sort, and so conspicuously devoid
inside of even the writers’ own
names and addresses, that the
owners could not be traced. No
fewer than 1194 articles were posted
without any address at all, while
those wrongly addressed numbered
18,757. The office followed up a
number of the complaints. In 35
cases the missing letter turned up at
the writer’s home ; a nurse lost one
on the road to the post office; three
were found in the writers’ pockets
after a dust had been kicked up at
the p. 0.; one was unaddressed ; 55 were
wrongly addressed, and the contents of 19 were
found in the Dead Letter office in the same state ;
16 had been duly delivered, but had been mislaid
after deli very ; and a postal note —the contents of
aletter declared to be lost—was found in a book,
where presumably the addressee had left it. The
Department owns up to 64 cases of carelessness.
So it isn’t one-tenth so casual as the public which
complains of its alleged casualness.
* * * *
The early morning canter or sprint, with
a milk-cart in the lead and a motor-car in full
chase, is becoming a familiar feature of Mel-
bourne’s daily life, and is likely to continue so
until the law provides a stiff course of stonebreak-
ing, without the option, for frequent offenders.
Scarcely a day passes without milk adulteration
cases being heard at one court or other. Mostly
there are three or four a day, but the minimum
fine of £lO usually handed out by the honorarium
fails to stop the rascally trade. The cheerful,
noisy “Milk-oh!” used to reckon on getting caught
about once a year or so, but since the inspectors
took to using a motor the odds have been sadly
reduced ; so now, when the milk fiend sees a party
in one of these machines coming along in a hurry
and gesticulating to him, he swiftly drives up the
nearest right-of-way and capsizes his can of
ordinary mercantile milk in the gutter, or
heaves it into a backyard. That only means
a £5 fine for “obstructing the inspectors.”
One such youth miscalculated badly the other day.
Being hard pressed, he pulled his prad up along-
side a fence and heaved the can with its contents
bodilv over ; then he drove down the lane to meet
the inspectors, relying on the householder to
accept the “ milk ”as the price of silence. Unfor-
tunately, a woman happened to be just inside that
fence feeding her fowls. The can landed partly
on her foot and partly on the neck of her best
Leghorn pullet; consequently, while the “Milk-
oh!” was cheerfully passing the time of day to
the inspectors and assisting them to samples of
his “ good ” milk, his left ear received a visit from
a Leghorn pullet, propelled by a limping woman
in a bad temper. The explanations were con-
siderable, but “Milk-oh” was observed to smile
cheerfully as he departed. He had saved his boss
a fiver, less the cost of the fowl.
The career of an Armenian gentleman
named Terence Callaghan, of Richmond (Vic.),
should be worth watching. He lately scored his
seventh conviction for selling watered milk, or
milky water. His fines already totalled £33, and
as the added water this time amounted to 24 per
cent., the Court stuck another £2O on. There
might be some nice wagering as to which limit
Terence will reach first —the £lOO fine or 100 per
cent, of water. It is satisfactory to reflect that
he can’t go beyond the latter limit, anyhow.
UNRELIABLE.
“If you don't promise to marry me I'll shoot
myself.
“ It’s all very well saying that just now, but you
know what a fellow you are to change your
mind."
A very dead philanthropist has just been
heard from in Adelaide. In 1876 William Parkin,
M.L.A., and otherwise well known, endowed a
benevolent fund for Congregational- churches,
with the proviso that it was not to start active
benevolence till its annual income
reached £lOOO. At that time £12,000
or so would have been capital enough
for the purpose, and it seemed that a
very few years of accumulation would
get the fund to the point at which it
could commence distributing its in-
come. But interest fell, and fell,
and dropped, and tumbled. For
years the fund, despite accumula-
tions at compound interest, got
further away from its goal instead
of nearer to it. It was a stern chase
—the fund after the Congregational
Church —and at times the Church
was so far ahead that all hope of
overtaking it seemed lost. But at
long last the income has touched the
£lOOO mark, and the distribution
commences. And quite probably it
will hardly have commenced before
another fall in interest will make it necessary to
stop again and accumulate some more.

One of the private residential estates
which Bent doubtless would have purchased for
the Vic. Government went begging at auction
last week. This is the property (seven acres of
land with a mansion on it) situated at the corner
of St. Kilda and Domain roads. Melbourne. It
strikes the casual passer-by as being one of the
best building sites in the metropolis, but is appa-
rently too near town to be a tempting suburban
spec.' Bent threw out hints rc the converting of
this estate into a Government herbarium in con-
nection with the adjacent Botanical Gardens, and
but for the scandal attaching to his other land
purchases, this might have been quietly added to
the list. The Murray Government last week de-
cided not to spend the proposed £20,000 or so
as a first outlay on a herbarium ground. Two
days later the rejected property was put up for
sale by the executors of the late owner and passed
in again. The house which nobody seems to want
was built for Major-General Hutton of yore, and
the seven acres were the scene of some festive
garden parties.
“Johanna”: Nomadic as the Arabs—
so does the modern Australian threaten to
become. The tentmaker, that philosophical
soul, finds more and more work to do.
Tentmakers and • bootmakers develop a cyni-
cal philosophy all their own. However ob-
scure and poverty-stricken a cobbler you will
always find him a thinking man, and a cynical
one. The feet of men are clay, however godlike
they manage to appear to a coterie of worship-
pers. Until recently the tentmakers have been
comparatively few. But the sleeping-out craze
has gone far when it has induced the natty
suburban well-to-do to encumber his several
square feet of carefully-mown lawn with a
sedate toy tent. The sleeping out and the
week-end tent has been a strong institution
for several seasons. Now, at the sea fringe
all round the bay, are the lines of canvas.
Some enterprising boarding-house perpetra-
tors have given up stable dwellings and
have grown a mushroom-like colony of small
tents, with an immense canvas dining-room
as a nucleus. In the ti-tree scrub there are
streets and rows of stretcher-furnished tar-
paulin, let for weeks or week-ends. Easter
ended the summer crop of tent-dwellers,
and the owners count their gains. I heard
half-a-dozen girl shop-toilers (those in-
tensely coiffured and smart-skirted maidens)
tot up the “engagements” of the Easter go-
as-you-please. There were seven senti-
mental engagements, with every prospect
of matrimonial culmination, out of fourteen
tents —or fourteen engagements out of
seven tents, I’m not sure which. The surf
bathing that is thrown in with the tent
life has a strong lien on the market.
Plump, chic, sun-browned girls dabbling
about in hysterical fear and the cutest
thing in flimsy bathing dress, appeal
to the brawny, brave, masculine de-
fender. Melbourne suburban beaches
are many and of long stretches —the
councils, or protecting corporations,
here have not yet had to resort to
“regulations” in aquatic gear as
in the elbow-jostled surf crowds
on the comparatively few harbor
beaches of Sydney. Melbourne
maidens have scope for stronglv-
imaginative covering. Scarlet and
brevity are the favorite combina-
tions in the fancy of the plump,
nut-brown maid.

Under the Neitenstein regime,
prisoners in N.S.W. gaols receive
some very thoughtful attentions.
When he approaches the end of his
sentence, Burglar Bill is questioned as to
what sort of a billet he would like to
fill on getting out, and what part of the
country he would like best to live in. Then
Mr. Neitenstein exerts himself, and stirs up
outsiders to provide the suitable job. When
old Keck was Governor of Darlinghurst his
kindness took the form of allowing the prisoner
who was near the end of his term to go about
Sydney during the day, that he might, if pos-
sible, take a job by the forelock. It was very
good of Keck, but the results were poor ; a clob ■-
cropped citizen who asked if a billet would tie
available in two or three weeks’ time, and who
fled alarmedly in the direction of the gaol when
offered an immediate job, hadn’t much chance.
THE MIDDLE MAN.
In bubonic plague the intermediary, coming between
the rat and man, is the flea. Householders should clean
their houses of it.— N.S.W. Board of Health's chairman.
Maoriland has just had its attention drawn
to the fact that it has no legal machinery to pre-
vent a doctor who is hopelessly insane practising
his profession till he does something to bring him
within the grip of the law. In this case, a doctor
was tried for murder, and at the trial it came out
that his “ eccentricity” was well known, and that
quite a number of people had prophesied that
some day he would “shake things up.” But he
continued to practise till, one quiet evening, he
killed a lady and shook up the corpse, and now
Maoriland is inquiring whether any more mad
doctors are running: round among people who are
fully aware of their “eccentricities.” Some
people even propose that doctors should be
periodically inspected, like other cattle.
THE LAND OF THE GAY AND GRIM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
London is perhaps the spot where one can oftenest see
the extremes of poverty and economy, contrasted with
lavish expenditure.—Pall Mall Magazine.
It’s oh ! to be in London now, with the springtime scents
around ;
To sit in the dear old penny chairs, with your feet on the
greening ground ;
To 101 l in your dear old taxi-cab, or bump in your dear old
’bus,
And wolf in baste your farthing fish, or your early
asparagus.
It’s oh ! to lounge in the playhouse bars, with a earriage-
and-pair outside,
Or to smoke your fag in the sixpenny seats, with a long
warm beer supplied ;
It’s oh ! to see wild life in town on the shavings of half-a-
jim,
In the town where a thousand are glad and g'ay, and a
million are mostly grim.
It’s oh ! to savor the dear old slums, and gloat on the
dear old scenes
Where the housewife hargles for mouldy bones, and
judges the margarines ;
To drive to the gilded stoking-halls where they have
stuffed fowl for lunch,
Or the dear old crowded dining-dens where the sad scone-
snatchers munch ;
To back up your cart with your East End tart for a tup-
penn}' afternoon tea,
Or motor down for a five-o’clock to Brighton beside the
sea.
It’s oh ! for the bowl of London life, to lap at its
bubbling brim,
Though only a thousand are gay and glad, and a million
are mostly grim.
Arise, then, sons of Australian Fat, for the voice of the
Spring we hear ;
Strike camp, and make for the land of bliss in the youth
of the English year 1
Come on, we’ll gather our travelling-traps, and give
three cheers and go
To the lovely isle in the northern seas where the Free-
trade orchids grow !
We’ll leave our native shores awhile ; but, when the fogs
come down,
With a swag of suits and socks and ties, as worn by the
Court and Crown,
We’ll seek our sun-warmed South again, and murmur a
prayer for him
Who dwells where the thousands are glad and gay—and
the millions are gaunt and grim 1

The Queensland tick, after a battle royal
with Ma State’s dairy-inspectors, has passed over
the Tweed River and has put in an appearance on
the upper reaches of the Richmond River, where
the big Cow cheques come from. Nothing seems
to interpose between the tick and the whole of
the eastern seaboard, save its alleged dislike of
the climate and scenery further south. The tick
question is a subject of contention between
N.S.W. and Queensland, each blaming the other
State for its neglect and inefficiency when engaged
in shooing the animal off the premises. The Ma
State, indeed, is wailing at the inefficiency of
State quarantine in all its aspects, and is beseech-
ing the Federal authority to assume control of
quarantine matters. Which is singularly unlike
Ma in her general aspect.
“ Cict ” : The ignorance of some people
occasions me pain. Ido not refer, in the present
instance, either to Joe Cook or to the aboriginal
tribesmen of Outback who have not yet bumped
culture, rum, and the missionary. Rather do 1
indicate (1) “Flinderino ” (B. 4/3/’o9)—he who con-
tends that the pewit alias pevvee, is the most
frequent bush bird in Australia —and (2) “ Myrtlea
who alleges (B. l/4/’O9) that the leatherhead holds
the biscuit for numerousness. Where, I ask these
false-alarm naturalists, do they place the parra-
keet, the green-leek, and the grass-parrot ? In
fact, where, for that matter, do they place the
whole damn family of the parrots ? “ Myrtle ’ is
several leagues ahead of “Flinderino” in his
nomination ; and yet for every leatherhead that is
loose in any part of any of the Australian States
there’s at least 900 parrots. Moreover, while the
leatherhead is indeed a rara avis in Riverina, the
parrot is in divers millions in every corner of the
continent. Also the white cockatoo has a2oto 1
opportunity of pulling off the ribbon against
either the pewit or the leatherhead.
“ J.Gr.” : “Torkin’ erbout corpsus bein’
found in old shafts,” remarked Bill from Scotch-
man’s. “ Six of us wus oncet workin’ a claim on
the Durham Lead. We ’ad a ’ole down erbout
70ft. afore we struck the gutter. It was a dam
wet shaft, too; we ’ad ter keep balin’ erbout five
canvas tanks to one bucket of dirt. An’ from
Satiday till Monday the bloomin’ ole would get
erbout 40ft. of water in it. We ’ad driv along the
gutter a couple er hundered feet, when, one Mon-
day mornin’ we took er look down the shaft
an’ saw that some fool ’ad tumbled down an got
drownded, or sooisided, or been murdered an
pitched down. Any’ow, tlier ’e wus down our
shaft, only ’is boot-’eels erbove the water. We
told the boy who druv the horse in the whip
ter gallup like blazes into the township
fer Brown, the bobby. I says we’d better
git ’im outer the water, but the others said it was
no blamed use as the bloke was ded. Presently
Brown galloped up. ‘What's ther matter? e
says; an’ when we told ’im, he says we oughter
fished the ded-’un out. Brown got narked when
we says we left that job fer him. ’E says e
thought it wus sooiside, as the corpse must have a
stone tied to ’is neck. Brown took off ’is ’elmit
an’ coat, an’ said ’e supposed ’e ’ad ter go down,
an’ we lowered ’im. When he got down to the
water, ’e grabbed ’old of the corpsus’ leg. Then
’e dropped it like er hot spud, and yelled ter us
ter pull ’im up. When ’e landed, ’e swore at us
somethin’ awful, an’ said he ’oped we would all go
ter ’ell. It turned out that the stiff-’un wus only
our old wheelbarrow, which we left in the drive
on Saturday afternoon, an’ ’ad floated out on the
w&ter an’ riz up the shaft when the water riz, the
tips of its ’andles bein’ just erbove the water.
But they wus the ded ring fer a pair of ’eels
belongin’ to a corps of a sooiside or a murder.”

“Jimmie Pannikin Said Muttama Mick
to me : “ Yis, I’ve’ad some rare good fishin’ in

The Tweed River (N.S.W.) cow cocky is
feeling anxious about paspalum, the grass he

various kinds ; even buffalo grass couldn t stay its
progress over the face of the earth. He thought
that nothing in the heavens above or in the earth
beneath could make it fight hard for its existence.
But a weed, locally called Dunbible weed, is now
threatening cocky’s paspalum. This weed gets its
name from the fact that it was first noticed at
Dunbible, near Murwillumbah, during- the time
the Lismore-Tweed railway was being built. Ihe
seeds of it are supposed to have come there in a
consignment of chaff for the horses employed on
the railway construction works. The shire council,
five of whose six members are cow cookies, lias de-
clared it a noxious weed, and the whole population
is called upon to shoot it on sight.
OBVIOUSLY UNSUITABLE.
STOREKEEPER : “ We have no
quart billies just now.
This is the smallest in
stock.”
SWAGMAN: “ I'd look blanky
well, wouldn't I, arskin a
publican to fill that fer a tray?”
“ Mallacoota ” : A paternal Victorian
Government some time ago undertook a campaign
of extermination against the fish-eating cormorant.
Threepence a head bonus was given, and in some
districts cormorant hunters did well. The birds
have regular roosting places. What the average
shag really likes is a high tree at the head of some
creek or inlet, and where a shooter could get a
dozen or so in a line the hunting paid, lhis
satisfactory state of affairs continued until an
enterprising south-of-Gabo chap got a cutter and
went out among the islands with which the
Southern Ocean is dotted from Bass Straits to
East and North of Wilson’s Promontory, lhe
cormorants have their rookeries and breeding
places on some of these bleak islets, and the
hunter averaged about £l4 a day for a while.
Then the staggered Ministry withdrew the bonus,
and another promising industry was busted.
“ Tally walka” goes to a Dreadnought
meeting :
The latest in our township is the appearance of the
Dreadnought complaint. Five or six of the more badly
diseased requisitioned the mayor to call a public meet-
ing and he did it. After he had personally started the
ball’ rolling, a little old man mentioned something or
other about Ole Hingland in a very low, awe-inspiring
whisper. He became very badly rattled on account of
the audience helping him to forget most of what he
intended to say, and sat down amidst great enthusiasm.
Then a warrior, with moustache bristling*, said desper-
ately that an Englishman is worth two foreigners ; after
which he assured us he would lay down all he possessed,
and even his life, if it comes to war. He had a sale a day
or two later, which leads me to think that he leaves for
Germany immediately to tear a Dreadnought up by the
roots, and bring it home via Pooncarie and the Darling
River. Next a business man worked off some energetic
remarks about Germany, and he knocked some sparks out
of William before he sat down. He omitted to mention
that a great part of the contents of his store were im-
ported from Germany, and that a quota of the money
paid therefor is helping to build the German Dread-
noughts. He felt sure that when the Japs come along
Fisher’s three “Insect destroyers” will be about Port
Pirie or somewhere unhandy. It didn’t seem to strike
him that 23 (not three) “ Insects” at Port Pirie will any-
how be more useful to us in such a case than a Dread-
nought in the North Sea. The drunkest man in the
audience apologised for Fisher by interjecting pretty
often that we must make a start some time or other.
Our kid-banger followed with some well-worn yap about
sentiment and gratitude, and then produced his trump
card. He reckons we’ll save our necks by giving a
Dreadnought to England. This was a very diplomatic
argument for these dry and dusty parts, as the neck is
pretty well indispensable, and it went pretty close
to relaxing* the grip I had on my own bob.
Had he followed up this neck argument I believe
a quid would have been .collected. He very
unwisely side-tracked, and made a move for the door, say-
ing a couple of children would give us an item. It was
only a ruse to get away, because no item turned up.
Taking advantage of a painful pause which occurred
about this time, the second-drunkest man made a dive
for the platform and safely arrived. “ Mr. Chairman, 1
have much pleasure in proposing and seconding that this
town does the same as all the other towns have done in
the present industrialspute in Broken Hill and send
some money to the strikers.** (Loud applause.) His
Warship made clockwork-like motions with his
hands, and ruled the speaker out of order. The
strike-pay advocate made an adventurous journey,
back to his seat. A resolution was put to the
meeting by his Warship for a show °f hands in favor of
opening a Dreadnought presentation fund. Nineteen
out of the 87 present hoisted their beer-lifters, and his
Warship remarked desperately that the motion was
carried unanimously. It required a nervy man, but he
went there to do the job, and he did it. On an invita-
tion being made by his Warship for donations, two bob
was collected from an old chap in the front seat, so it s
to be hoped he .saves his neck. We finished up with
“Gor* Save,** and scooted hard for our groggenes at 10
p.m.
“Coda” (from Lawler’s, W.A.) : I am
late in contributing my quota to this kookargu-
ment, owing to the delay in the construction of
Australia’s transcontinental railway- Let me say
without preamble that I have known many Jacks,
and none of them cared a guffaw whether his meat
was dead or alive. The notable thing about the
kook is not so much what he eats as the amount
he eats. I had a young one once, and was accus-
tomed’to cut his meat up for him, being under the
delusion that if I didn’t he might get dyspepsia
or something. One day I took about a pound
of steak to his perch (half being for him, half for
my wife’s pup), and, cutting it in two pieces, I
put one piece aside while I divided the other
into what I considered negotiable chunks.
When I had finished, I looked around for the first
piece. Alack, it was gone. Jack, the bird whose
digestion I was protecting, had, scoffed it whole.
There was something wrong with the Jack that a
recent Bulletin contributor said he saw leavinga
dead cow the other day. My Jack would not
have left the animal. He would have swallowed
it. horns and all.
LIFE IN A BUSH TOWNSHIP.
Scene at intervals in main street. A most
valuable dog has been poisoned. The residents
are endeavoring to resuscitate it. It has been
dosed with salt, also tobacco. Its tail has been
removed, ears lopped, smoke blown up its nostrils;
and though there are still some 27 more remedies
to apply, grave doubts are entertained as to its
recovery.
SAW PIT GULLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By twilit jungles, where steep spurs ended,
All lonely and wild and strange,
Where songs of waters and birds were blended.
Ran Sawpit Gully through gorges splendid,
Under the Moonbi Range.
There came the teams with their jungle treasure,
Skidding from north and south ;
There swung the saws with a rhythmic measure,
And days of labor and days of pleasure
Were ours at the sawpit’s mouth.
Ripping the logs and the planks asunder,
Spitting out jets of dust,
From early morn till the sun went under
The steel fangs humm’d through the rich red plunder,
Torn from the hills august.
The dust made cushions—in bags we stuck it;
Our beds were of feath’ry fern ;
Our dinner bell was a leaky bucket,
We dropped our tools when the waddy struck it,
And carried up “ bits to burn.”
We fared full well on a long plank table,
Women and girls and men,
Under a roof with no wall or gable,
And never was better in fact or fable
Than tea in our pint-pots then.
The whispering nights in the firelight found us
Gathered before the camps,
While dingoes howled Tong the scrubs that bound us,
And here and there in the gloom around us
Twinkled the firefly lamps.
Then a jolly girl did enchantment render
O’er all did those hills enclose ;
And five of six did betimes attend her,
For her soft eyfes rivalled the bluebell's splendor.
Her mouth was a fresh red rose.
Some sought her hand ’neath the starry glory,
And one on a day of rain ;
All five at last told the olden story,
And four went forth when the glens were hoary,
Nor came to the camps again.
Ghosts of days that are long gone over,
Passing in dumb review,
At places linger where they discover,
Down the way of the reckless rover
His fairest of heart-flowers grew.
And long they linger on Sawpit Gully,
That only the thunders change,
Where nought is now that can spoil or sully
But phantom saws that at night sound dully
Under the Moonbi Range.

“ W.J.A.” tells about a Chow :
About eight years ago The Bulletin published a par.
concerning the most cheerful Outback funeral on record
—that of Ah Cat, an optimistic Chinaman, who be-
cpieathed £lO to the local band to play rollicking tunes
en route to the grave.
I performed on a slide trombone on that occasion, and
helped to blare out “ When Johnny Comes Marching
Home,” “The Girl ’e Left Behind ’im,” “The Cat Came
Back,” and suchlike inspiriting ditties. The temperature
was 109“, a cloud of dust obscured the procession, and
having blown ourselves as dry as Og’s bedstead, we had
sundry drinks at the expense of the estate on the way
home.
The other day came the queer sequel to the affair.
After all these years, a casual Chinaman blew into the
Never-Never (where he came from nobody knows) and
proceeded to collect the bones of the departed yellow
heathen for transmission to China, in accordance with
ancient custom. He fastened to a long-handled shovel
and got to work on the grave of Ah Cat, but he was dis-
turbed by an angry female—for it appears that the late
demented had left a white widow and family, who
strongly objected to any interference with the remains.
The authorities here stepped in and restrained the casual
yellow pagan—virtue being thus rewarded and the villain
discomfited.
These casual yellow men periodically turn up at coun-
try towns on the bone-accumulating business. The
practice is simple. The dry bones are gathered together
in a “soogee” bag and taken to the nearest billabong.
There they are scraped and washed. The bone-gatherers
are not particular where the washing is done. On one
occasion, at Brewarrina, we saw a couple of them sluicing
a bag of bones in the identical spot where we drew our
drinking water. As the Darling was low at the time, and
not flowing, we passed them along with great violence
and profanity, and shot the bones into outer darkness.
On another occasion, on the Lachlan, the washing was
done in a lagoon where a dairyman got his water supply.
The said dairyman didn’t seem to mind, and, before I
could persuade the local council to get a move on, the
offenders and the bones were back in China.

“ Wot I hobjeks ter about this ’ere tram trailin’

“ Huffin-Guffin ” : How some men will
struggle for a free and independent crust rather
than work for a boss ! This letter is from a miner
at Mount William (Vic.), where there was a rush
a few years ago. The miner has several times
attempted to get away, but after working on
wages for a while the call of the free life, the
bush, and the pure mountain air was irresistible :
lam still in the tunnel. The shareholders let us the
mine on tribute. I have not had a penny since January
[written 19/3/’o9]. We have our dirt stacked, and are
waiting for water. I have had rabbit every day since
February 6. We robbed a wild beehive, and so are living
on rabbits and wild honey. . . . I don’t get much to
read. Have not seen a Bulletin for a long, long time.
Wish I could see it. Will when it rains, and we can wash
our dirt.
So the circulation of The Bulletin will increase
by at least one when it rains.
AFTER THE SMASH.
SYMPATHETIC STRANGER: “Are you very much hurt, my dear sir?”
IRRITABLE VICTIM : “ How the devil can I tell till I find my glasses? ”
“ S.T.S.” : Did James Dee really build his
haystack over and around a hut (B. 11/3/’O9) ? It
seems an expensive kind of foundation, even when
one is going to sell the result by its estimated
tonnage. As James doubtless got the idea from
Lever’s “ Handy Andy,” an Irish novel once im-
mensely popular, he might just as well have used
it without trying to improve on it. Andy, who
was supposed to be a simpleton, sold his haycock
to the Squire as it stood ; and it stood mostly on
a rock, as the Squire’s men found when they tried
to cart it away. Andy’s defence was the best of
the joke. “ Sure,” said he, “didn’t the blessed
St. Pether found the Church on a rock ; and why
wouldn’t I be founding my cock of hay on a rock?”

“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : Dannie Arkins
often begged of me to go out to his farrum on the
Goodradigbee for a few days’ fishing. I never
could get the time. One day he met me in Bina-
long. “Now, lukit here,” said he, “th’rivir is
in splendid thrim forr fishin’. O’ive ’ad free
extree rooms added to' the place ; so there’s plinty
shlapin’ accommodation. Oi’ want ye to come out
this day fortnight widout fail. Oi’ll have tucker,
lashin’s ov whisky, fishin’ loines, hooks, sinkers,
baits, ivviry t’ing that’s wantid. All ye have
ta do is ta bring yirself an’ a couple ov yir
frinds along—the Police Magisthrate forr
wan ; he’s a foine fellow, tho’ he found me
two quid not long ago fer righteous behavior
last Show Day. Oi’ll have th’ fish yarded
up in a shtretch about haff a moile long.
Oi’ll put woire-netting at wan ind, and
fix up a narrer inthrance about haff a mile
up above. Now do coine an’ thry yir luck
an’ moi whisky.” I made all necessary
arrangements. Two days before the ap-
pointed date I got a letter from Arkins :
“ I am sending you these few lines hop-
ping you are well, as it does not leave
me at present. Three days ago the river
ran banker. It’s still running, being
yards higher in the middle than at the
sides. It carried away miles of me
fencing and drowned 200 weathers.
But come out with your frends, and
we’ll go shooting rabbits, looking for
fences, and drinking whisky. It’s a
poor heart that never rejoices. Glory be,
it might have turned out worse.” I did
not go. My fishing luck is cruel.
“A.H.8.” : Of all the thousands of
methods of starting a jibbing horse that have
come my way, the most effective I know is to
pour cold water on the stubborn equine’s rump.
I first saw it tried on the Mossman, in North
Queensland. The cocky who made the experi-
ment had the swiftest drive of his life during the
next ten minutes. Let some stuck-up Aboites try
this scheme, and report progress and the velocity
thereof.
* * * *
“ Bushie ” from a very far out part of
North Queensland: —
I have, just read your article on “The Northern Terri-
tory and other Large Matters ” (B. 4/n/’O9), be-
sides others in former issues. Keep right on, rub it in,
insist, insist. High Protection, compulsory military
training, Australian navy, immigration, and close settle-
ment. The damphools who run this show must be made
to see our danger as you appear to do. I live on the
verge of it. Twenty-one years in the Gulf and N. Terri-
tory, and I know the emptiness of this vast land. I never
heard “Gor’ Save” or “ Soldiers of the Queen ” once
during the Boer row. I have not seen a dozen men
together, or a railway line, or a steamer since 1896, nor
have I slept in house, pub, or shanty during that time,
and I’ve not stopped in the one place either by a long
chalk.
Those facts will help you to see the emptiness of the
country. Much of these wastes (?) would he excellent
rice-producing districts, and the Chow and Jap know it.
Any tropical plant would grow in many parts ; and the
mineral country is only scratched.
Go stronger ! Advocate free agricultural holdings for
a period of 100 years all along the coast country —with
personal residence. Get the population in the country
and we can hold it.
“ L’Fou ” : “ Huffin-Guffin ” writes re the
vanishing Glenelg (11/3/’O9), and has dark sus-
picions about the ffiling-up of other Australian
rivers. There is ground for those suspicions. A
stream under my notice (Tarwin River, Gipps-
land) seems to have the same disease. Years ago
there were many diving and swimming holes along
its course. Now you’ll strike sand or mud (if you
don’t strike a snag) at a depth of 3ft. anywhere
(summer level). As this trickle used to run
through dense forest (it is nearly all cleared now),
“ Huffin’’ is probably right in his theory about
the bank-binding virtue of the timber. The de-
cayed branches, etc., of slaughtered trees in the
river bed are also active agents in collecting soil
and debris and thus clogging the channels. Verily
the tree-murderer has a lot to answer for. By the
way, does “ Huffey ” know what becomes of the
lost water, anyhow ?
NON-COMMITTAL.
FRIEND: “Is it true, Jimmy , that you've signed
th’ pledge ?”
JIMMY: “I can't say till I know whether y'r
goin' to shout or not.”
“Henry Phelthafcfc ” : People who send
their nearly grown-up offspring into the world
without a knowledge of the relative values of
right and left bowers deserve to be smitten
heavily with the vocabulary. Moreover, it is
time that the information was imparted in our
public schools. Consider the awkward position
in which young men reared in ignorance of our
national game are placed. I remember once, at
the Black Plains Hotel, we could only muster
three. A stranger was lying on the couch. My
mate twisted round on his oil drum. “ Make up
the corner in a game of euchre, ole chap ? ” he
said. The poor fellow fidgeted uncomfortably.
“Can’t play,” he confessed feebly. My mate
was so taken back’at the man’s ignorance that he
forgot to choose his words. I’m sure he didn’t
mean to hurt the feelings of the young fellow.
“Can’t play?” he repeated. “Gawd love me,
where ’ave you bin dragged up ? ”
KEEPERS OF THE KEYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the scattered lights on the northern capes.
Where the tramps go to and fro ;
By the windy cliffs of the eastern gates,
Where the wild cross-currents flow ;
And the shifting sands of the southern bights.
Where the roaring tempests blow ;
By these, and the western scarps of stone.
With their waters white and green,
And the billowing hills of eucalypt
In the land that lies between—
We have made a pact with the white-skinned race
Whereby we shall keep it clean.
We are sworn to this for the white-skinned race.
At home and across the seas,
To keep the blood from a dingy taint
As we guard it against disease ;
Of a right we are strict at the seaboard gates
Of a right, for we keep the kej's.
We have brothers out where the four winds go
Brothers, and next-of-kin,
Of various speech and divers minds
Yet all of them white of skin.
They find no bickering at our doors ;
We nod, and we pass them in.
Of a right we shall keep our country clean ;
Of a right we shall keep it white ;
We hold it in fee for our clean-limbed sons,
From the Gulf to the stormy Bight.
We may not barter the future’s claims,
And if we must fight, we fight 1
So this is the pact from the Eastern gates
Across to the Western seas,
And through from the Gulf to the stormy Bight,
The pact that our race decrees—
That we shall be strict at the nation’s door
Of a right, for we hold the keys !

large areas at a nominal rent. (2) Private ownership may
be all right if there are rigid laws to prevent any owner
possessing more than a moderate area, and to give every
tenant the right to purchase at a moderate price. In
France, Belgium, and Denmark, despite private owner-
ship, the laws have created such a subdivision of land that
the process can hardly go any further and yet leave the
farmer a living area (in Belgium they have got the living
area down so fine that more than half the farms don’t
exceed 2£ acres). The Northern Territory is almost
entirely State-owned land, yet there you find stupendous
estates larger than a German principality', leased for two
generations at less rent per square mile than the
Belgian farmer pays in taxes for his 2J acres.

The two handles are connected with a pump
(not seen by the visitor,), which supplies water
for the Governor’s shower-bath. The above
illustrations explain the modus operandl more
lucidly than could a whole library of print.
The visitor, by a slight effort, gets a Vice-Royal smile
that will haunt him for months, anti at the same time per-
forms an act of real utility.
Intensely loyal citizen, who gave £175,000 to the
Dreadnought fund, has to be dragged away from the
handles after pumping 18gals. of liquid loyalty.
And instead of such a simple and business-like contrivance
as this, we have the Exs. shaking 1000 people by the hand,
and worn to rags at the end of the ceremony.

MR. H. G. WISE, A POSSIBLE FEDERAL
DEMOCRATIC lEADER OF THE FUTURE.
“ Jacq ” : Joe Bible was the appropriate
name of one of the bookmakers at the JJaylesford
(Vic.) Paster sports. It was hot and dusty, and
before the day was over all doubts about the per-
spiration of the sacred volume were set at rest.
Mr. James Harry Peacock, father of the
Victorian ex-Premier, Alexander the Kookaburra,
celebrated his 80th birthday last week. Alexander
didn t inherit the laugh from his parent. He in-
vented it.
The Himpenal things that British states-
men do live after them : the good is oft interred
with their bones—in a Marc Antony way of
speaking. On the tenth anniversary of Gladstone’s
death his statue in the London Strand attracted
just one little memorial wreath from an unknown
rememberer; whereas Beaconsfield, the father of
Jingoism, who died in 1881, draws more floral
tributes to his statue on every anniversary of his
death than a fashionable prima-donna on the first
night of a new opera. The one premier
Dia for the patronage of prosperous pos-
terity ; the other didn’t. Benjaman
rseaconsneld was a Jew whose foreign
policy was ever shaped in the interests of
Cohen, and whose home policy was directed
to the safeguarding of hereditary Fat.
All Jews admire his memory, and Fat
both Jew and Gentile, can afford to be
generous to it. Besides, he didn’t make a
special feature of his personal and political
integrity, like Gladstone, of whom
Babouchere said : “I don’t blame the old
fox for keeping an ace up his sleeve, but
I do object to his always pretending that
God Almighty put it there.” Now posterity
m the bulk refuses to canonise any poli-
tician who trimmed his own hat with a
halo.
Died in Paris recently, aged 85,
the Comtesse de Chabrillan, better known
as Celeste Mogador, who had been away
from the public eye for a very dragged-out
period. About GO years ago she was one of
the stars at the Bel Mamille, and after-
wards appeared in Parisian circuses and
music hails. In 1854 Lionel de Moreton,
Comte de Chabrillan, became infatuated
with her, and married her. When he was
appointed I rench Consul in jVlelbourne
she came out with him, and lived in the
Victorian capital for some time. Subse-
quently she wrote several plays and novels,
winch didn’t attract much notice, but when
she set about writing her memoirs the
1 ( rench Government interfered and pro-
hibited their publication. Celeste, appar-
ently, knew too much.
The town clerk of Temora (N.S.W.) has
resigned on the ground that the place is unfit for
an honest man to live in. Come to think of it
didn t the town clerk of Gomorrah resign for
much the same reason.
It doesn’t necessarily follow that the new
Archbishop of Sydney shall be Primate of lus-
tra la, as the late Snath was. Atone time Sydney
had a hen upon the Primate’s job, but now any
boss-prelate is eligible. There is an impression
that the contract may go to St. Clair George
Alfred Donaldson, who dries his gaiters before
the fire at Brisbane. He is a son of Stuart
Alexander Donaldson, first Premier under Be
sponsible Government,in N.S.W., and afterwards
-treasurer m the Parker Min.stry-the third of the
series. Donaldson’s Government lasted 80 days
Cowper followed and lasted 37 days, and Parker
came next and hungiout something over U months.
I - Brisbane churchman’s father fought a duel
m 1851 with Surveyor-General Mitchell. One
combatant had his whisker ploughed up, and the
other had a bullet through his hat. The spot
where the duel was fought is not disclosed. The
Archbishops father died at Calton Hall, Cumber-
land, m 1807.
H. P. Somerset, who represents Stanley
in the Queensland Assembly, is said to be a lineal
descendant of the second Marquis of
Worcester, who was one of Cuarles I s s
chief supporters during the worry or
anxiety between that .King and his .Par-
liament. In 1644 Charles sent the Mar-
quis over to Ireland to influence the
Irish in ins favor, but his three years 5
mission didn't meet with much success.
When he returned to England m 1647, he
found things had gone badly with Charles,
and he spent the next 13 years either as
an exile, or a prisoner in the Tower of
Condon or as a prisoner out on chronic
bail. After the Restoration, lie made a
request to Charles ll.’s Parliament for
l iK P nn? en c ? f , at least some of the
TJIb.UOO, which, he alleged, he had spent
m the service of the king who lost his
head, and who never nad any head worth
mentioning. He didnT get the money.

llie career of the newly-arrived.
Premier Morris, of Newfoundland, is akin
to that of Janies Martin, of New South
Ti a e #' !i? oth c W A? e of Irish extraction,
llie father of Morris emigrated from
V\ aterford, and the father of Martin
from the adjoining county of Cork.
Morris was born in Newfoundland • Mar-
tin came to N. 8. Wales as an infant.
Morris was originally a solicitor, then
le qualified for the Bar, was admitted
entered Parliament and became Premier.
And James Martin did exactly the same in every
respect. 1
Young Fair bairn, who 'had to drop out of
the Cambridge (England) eight at the eleventh
bour, is a son of George Eairbairn, M.H K (of
Victoria), who in his day filled one of the seats in
the University’s, boat; while his brother Steve
now of Queensland, occupied another. Had the
youngster’s health kept right, he would have
established a record. Since the inter-universitv
contests were started, there is no case of father
and son having followed one another in the boats
and son, father, and uncle would form a still more
remarkable combination. All the same, if the
Australian Parliament is good enough for Eairbairn
to enter and draw a salary from, and Australian
sheep are good enough for him to get his living
off, why shouldn t an Australian university suffice
to educate his son ? Judging by the speeches of
Fair bairn,- senior, in the Reps., Cambridge doesn’t
seem such great shakes anyhow.
“Easterner ” writes :
In a recent issue a certain “Westerner” supplies a par
about Isidore Emanuel, of Westralia. I suppose
“ Westerner” was just lying for the satisfaction of filling
space—or he may have had some other end in view. Any-
how, his description is amazingly absurd. Isidore doesn’t
waddle, and he doesn’t wear diamonds. He didn’t come
into the theatre either after or before “ a heavy feed ” on
the night when “ Westerner’s” episode happened, for the
episode never happened at all. There are other dis-
crepancies in “ Westerner’s” letter, but I mention these
few to go on with.
AN ARTISTIC FAILURE.
Mr. Cook has no conception of a national policy, nor
even of outlining a party programme.— AGE.
CRITIC: “But what does it all mean? Where’s

“Spoff” : If there were an election for a
Chair of Volubility in the Vic. State Parliament,
Martin Hannah, member for (Jollingwood, would
be returned unopposed. No one would dare to
nominate against him. If anyone did, he would
lose his deposit. Martin’s garrulity is an eternal
affliction. On every subject, at all" times, and at
every opportunity, Martin rises and has a sav as
long as the dreams of youth. He out-yells" the
average gale with ease, Martin has one rival in
loquacity in the place wherein the multitude of
councillors means muddle— i.e., McCutcheon, of
bt. Hilda. But though McCutcheon comes next,
the ship of his conversation is hull down on the
horizon in Martin Hannah's wake.
.Ramsay Smith, President of the S.A.
1 üblic Health Hoard, says there is so much work
waiting to be done in Australia that no
offer would tempt him back to Great Britain.
He expressed regret that Prof. Bragg, after
speaking so vigorously concerning the need
and the scope for scientific research work
here, should have succumbed to the first
big offer from an English Uuiversity. Ram-
say Smith is Premier Price’s great stand-
by ; the Government consults him about
numberless things. And Ramsay Smith
really does know a lot about numberless
things. At Edinburgh he took prizes in the
arts, science, and medical courses ; was pre-
sident of the University Philosophical
Society, assistant Professor of Natural His-
tory, and Examiner in Zoology and Geology ;
and he was' examiner for degrees in medi-
cine and surgery for the Edinburgh College
of Surgeons and Physicians. Also he is a
Colonel in the Army Medical Corps, a
Fellow of the Scotch Educational Institute,
a musician, and he sat as an expert on the
Scotch Fisheries Commission.
Detective Roche, Acting-Chief of
N.S.W. force, is a firm believer m football as
an aid to the detection of crime. Men who
are wanted may dodge detection for months
at other periods of the year—even big cricket
won’t bring them out. But with the foot-
ball season their caution and cunning relax,
and they emerge on a Saturday afternoon;
and presently they forget their disguises
and yell m their natural voices. Also they per-
spire so profusely that it is only necessary, at
the interval, to hand them a scrap of newspaper
with a football paragraph on it, and ask their
views on the person who wrote it, and a thumb-
print can be secured right away.
Mentioned that Bishop Pain, of Gipps-
land (Vic.), may succeed to the Archbishopric of
Sydney. Bishop Pain was formerly incumbent at
Cobbity (N.S.W.), then for some years he shep-
herded at St. John’s, Darlinghurst, and in 1902
he was elected to toil in the episcopal vineyard of
Gippsland.
The recent decease of William McCulloch,
of Melbourne, left an orihce in the directorate of
the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus' Co., and
W. G. Sprigg, secretary to the co., has resigned
his ancient job in order to-fill it. Sprigg has
been in the tramway business for about 40 years,
and was secretary to the old Melbourne Omnibus
Co. before he pushed a secretarial pen on behaif
of the present concern. Personally, Sprigg is
well preserved, dapper and irreproachable; he
affects the kind of glasses which balance pre-
cariously on the nose, and wears a sensational pair
of unbridled side-whiskers; and is altogether of
that type that does everything that is respectable,
and nothing that is “ un-British.” Years ago he
was said to be the idol of all tram men, but,
fortunately, the disgraceful libel was killed before
it had time to take root.
“ Westerner ” writes :
Staniforth Smith, of Papua, understands the gentle art
of advertising. When he isn’t dining with cannibals (in
the daily papers) he is shooting excessively large animals,
or diving for pearls. His latest advertisement relates to
some remarkable walking feat. The Administrator is a
bustling man of affairs who doesn’t believe in hiding his
light in a cellar. When he was Mayor of Kalgoorlie
(W. A.) he got more press notices than G. Reid or Tommy
Burns. Then he stood for the Senate in 1901, and flabber-
gasted his opponents with full-page advertisements in
every little rag in the West. It paid, too, for Smith
topped the poll, though he was the last man to take the
field. As soon as he became Senator, the enterprising
Staniforth proceeded to reach out for a better job. He
toured the outlying regions of the Commonwealth, where
the nigger grows wild, and in due course was rewarded
with his present picturesque billet. All the same, Stani-
forth is a smart fellow, and would have made a fortune at
book-canvassing if he hadn’t taken to politics.
Writes the Oldest Inhabitant :
A belated application for Letter’s of Administration in
the estate of the late Andrew Lynch, one time in the
long ago member of the Legislative Assembly for Carcoar
(N.S.W.), has just been made by the Perpetual Trustee
Company. Mr. Lynch has been dead a great many years.
Two ether advertisements alongside are remarkable. The
seventeenth plan of accounts is ready in the estate of
Wallace Arabin Smith, of Gatnboola, iiolong ; likewise,
the fourteenth accounts in the estate of Hon. James (sic)
Smith, M.L.C. The latter was really John Smith, also of
Gamboola, and father of Wallace Arabin. John Smith died
very wealthy, and left four sons, all wealthy ; and six
(laughters, all of whom married well. John Smith owned
Gamboola, Llanarth, Boree Cabonne, Boree Nyrang, Too-
gong, Narroogal, Dovedale Park and Rosedale, and was
hall-marked by the Union Club.
“ 0.K.” from Melbourne :
It was a staggerer to many people to read in The Bul-
letin (8/4/’O9) that “ Leonard Grim wood, who died in Mel-
bourne last week,” was “ a champion pigeon slaughterer,
a dabster at driving trotters, something of a boxer, and
more of a billiardist,” and “ one of the best-known
sportsmen in Murray’s capital.” As a matter of fact, tins
Len Grimwood, who, seemingly, is now dead, was known
to the sporting world of Melbourne as a curious old nuis-
ance. He haunted Kirk's Bazaar in Bourke-street, and
the pavement thereof. His claim to publicity lay partly
in the tradition of his having had something to do with
trotting horses in the long- ago ere he settled down to
chronic us< lessness, hut mainly in his relationship
to brother Sam Grimwood and their father before them.
His champion pigeon potting and other achievements
must have been performed in the writer’s mind. In short,
Len Grimwood was not even a has-been in sport. He can
be truthfully described as a never-was. The obituary
notice of Len was correct enough in its reference to his
brother Sun, who migrated from Melbourne to Westralia
some years back. Sam was a bookmaker in a large way,
and a horseouner in a small way during the ’Bo’s. His
personality commanded respect, and what time he was
chairman of Bowes’ Tattersall’s Club in Melbourne, he
ranked as boss billiardist at the Victorian Club. Sam, in
his prime, was an all-round sport as well as a bookmaker.
He beg-an as a jockey, and was earning a livelihood in the
saddle when his father, the original Tom Grimwood, kept
the Rose, Shamrock and Thistle tlotel in Bourke-street,
fully 40 years ago. The old man made a lot of
money as a building contractor in the first
place, and subsequently as a pub-keeper and
general speculator. P rhaps lie also lost some of it
in the roaring Ws and ’7o’s, hut, anyway, he was a man
of brains and enterprise, was Tom Grimwood, and a capi-
tal pigeon-shot in the days when ruthless murder of
trapped blue-rocks came under the heading of justifiable
birdicide. T"m did his best to start a new industry in
Melbourne. He discovered, or dreamed of discovering,
gold at Collingwood Plat, where his friend, John Ander-
son, had opened a pub. As promoter and chairman of
the Collingwood Plat Gold Mining Co. he labored hard in
flannel shirt and moleskins to attract a rush to Oolling-
wood, and for a time Anderson’s pub paid splendid divi-
dends on the capital invested. Collingwood Plat, how-
ever, was found to be non-auriferous country, and Tom
Grimwood’s mine fell into disrepute. It was shrewdy
suspected of being a delusion and a spoof.
THE RESERVE FORCE.
The Lord Mayor of Sydney said he was determined that
in this part of the world we should show our intention
to support the Empire.
LORD MAYOR: “By-an’-bye your pa will come
out of the pub; an’, remember, you’re got to
support him safely past that wicked man
round the corner.”

Thy kingdom, shall pass , Galilean ; thy dead shall go
clown to thee de&cl.—Hymn to Proserpine.
Dead earth upon dead clay !
The spirit passed away
Cares not what droning
Voice plies with nasal zest
Its trade above his rest—
Chaunting, intoning !
In coffin and in urn
The dead have naught to spurn
Nor mouth for laughter ;
Green bud and withered leaf
Bring neither joy nor grief
To him hereafter.
He is the Dead, who goes
Outward where leaf to rose
Blossometh never ;
But pallid Proserpine
Leans, and with lips divine
Ends all endeavor.
No need to chide or chafe
For him who now lies safe
From scorn or weeping;
Let the poor, zealous rite
Beat vainly on the night
Where he is sleeping.
Vainly beside this ground—
Bent to the scourge, thorn-crowned,
Your gods, time-smitten,
Themselves would need to pray ;
Are you more strong than they,
Rector of Britain ?
Out in the darkness far
That knows no sombre star
Nor failing paean,
Vainly your mumbled creed
Shall bid him now take heed,
Old Galilean 1
Ends in unending night '
All sorrow, all delight
Tasted, untasted ;
The hymn your mild mouth sings
Ends with all other things
Dried, spent and wasted.
He shall not start nor stare
For all the troublous prayer
Around him pleading.
Your tongue shall fall and rust,
Your lips be blown to dust.
He lies unheeding.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Tasmania, the smallest and sleepiest of the Six
Sisters, arrives last with its revenue returns. The com-
plete Commonwealth figures for the first nine months of
the past two financial years are as under :
Nine Months’ States Revenue.
N. S. Wales .. £10,660,402 £10,151,796 Dec. £508,606
Victoria.. .. 6,312,495 6,113,276 Dec. 199,219
Queensland .. 3,283,012 3,395,326 Inc. 112,314
S. Australia .. 2,705,789 2,576,926 Dec. 128,863
Westralia .. 2,485,396 2,343,706 Dec. 141,690
Tasmania .. 757,457 692,915 Dec. 64,542
Tasmania’s contribution to the general anguish is very
creditable considering its size ; it suggests that the Island
of Dreams and Dodery could do an impressive deficit if it
were a little larger. The figures for March show a shrink-
age of £8554 as compared with last year. Income Tax
returned £1224 less, and “Other Receipts” £7596 less
than in 1908. Land Tax panned out £1065 for 1909, as
against £5ll in March, 1908 ; and Railways earned £25,799
—or £lB6O more than last year. “Sale and rental of
Crown lands ” realised £4443—£573 more than 1908.
Commonwealth refund was £25,081, which is £1969 less
than the pocket money handed out for the corresponding
period of last year. The five Sisters surrounding solvent
Queensland make a rather low-spirited group.

The National Bank, which led a rather quiet and ordinary
life for a number of years, makes a great expansion this
half. The expansion seems almost too great to be quite
real, and the idea arises that in recent periods the insti-
tution has been applying some of its profits to the
writing-off of the last remains or final tail end of the old
depreciation, and that, having now concluded this pro-
cess, it is able to let its visible profits loose, after the
manner of a released balloon, and being let loose they
immediately proceed to rise. This, of course, is mere
conjecture, and is advanced as such. Sixteen years ago
(on May 1, 1893) the National Bank temporarily sus-
pended, through the sins of others, and it is interesting
to note some of the changes since then :
Half-year to Half-year to
March, 1893. Sept'., 1909. Increase.
Capital £1,000,000 £1,498,220 £498,220
Gross Profits .. .. 123,529 137,383 13,854
Net Profits .. .. 51,456 59,170 7,714
Addition to Reserves 1,456 21,715 20,259
Decrease.
Reserves .. .. 600,488 207,975 392,513
Dividend .. .. 50,000 37,455 12,545
It may thus be safely asserted that in every way the
National Bank of Australasia is stronger than it was
before the unmerited disaster of 16 years ago. Its
capital is larger. So are its gross profits and its net
profits; it is more cautious over its dividend, and it makes
a far larger addition to its reserves than it did in the old
times. Certainly the reserves are smaller on paper, but
there is some reason to suppose that they are real. Sixteen
years ago, by reason of insane public borrowing, and the
insane land booming of a multitude of bogus land banks
and other disreputable institutions, all values were so
hopelessly fraudulent that no reserves were wholly real.
As regards another aspect of the case, the
National Bank makes a good showing:—
Net Profits in Proportion to Shareholders’ Funds
(Capital and Reserves).

It is a very handsome increase, and taken into considera-
tion with the expansion in other directions, as shown by

months, it is still more notable :

The advance in liquid assets is worthy of special con-
sideration. The National Bank’s liquid assets now re-
present about 37 per cent, of all its liabilities to the
public, which is a guarantee which should satisfy even a
fairly exacting creditor.

Tne Colonial Bank had a hard row to hoe after the great
disaster of 1893. It was never a boom bank like the
Commercial of Australia under the Gyles Turner manage-
ment, yet it had to suffer for the sins of others. But
good and steady management brought about a great
recovery, and to-day the Colonial is one of the most re-
spected institutions in Victoria. Its profits are not exactly
sensational, but they are at least respectable.

The Colonial Bank used to be noted for cutting its cash
reserves rather fine ; it had a yearning to have the money
out earning interest, and seemed to regard the coin that
lay in the strong room to be security against a sudden
emergency as so much interest wasted. But just now
there is an uneasy feeling that the recent burst of pros-
perity may have seen its best days ; the slump in copper
and lead, the conviction that the drought must be almost
due again, and the hazy war scare that hangs persist-
ently around the premises, all point in the same direc-
tion. Therefore it is gratifying to note that the Colonial
B.mk has made a great increase in the amount of its
liquid assets as a preparation for any possible emergency.
The figures which follow are evidence on this aspect of
the case :

The rise of the Royal Bank of Australia has been a really
wonderful circumstance. It was a very small, young,
fresh bank —a baby bank, in fact —when the smash hap-
pened in 1893. It was then the only bank with its head
office in Melbourne which didn’t suspend, and brutal
people said that it only escaped because it was so small
that its flurried shareholders couldn’t find it. But the
Royal, which had only one office and was, as already
mentioned, quite a baby bank, only smiled and went on
the even tenor of its way. It paid no dividends for some
years, but that was inevitable. It also wrote off some
capital, but that was unavoidable at a time when boom
values were disappearing like smoke. But it pegged in
steadily; it might be said, without straining the truth,
that it bogged in. The management was excellent, and
the solidity' of the little institution came to be recog-
nised. When it issued new shares to replace the
capital that had been lost it got a big premium. Its
reserves are now a good many times larger than they'
were before the 1893 disaster —in fact, they’ nearly repre-
sent all the capital that was lost about that time ; and
the dividend is larger than it ever was in the old boom
days. Also the bank begins to reach out for business in
places where it was formerly unknown. Some further
particulars are appended :

The fact that the liquid assets have decreased and that
the advances have greatly expanded, shows that the Royal
Bank, in common with many others, lias found that there
is a steadily increasing demand for money, and has done
its share towards meeting the demand. Yet the liquid
assets represent some 42 per cent, of all liabilities to the
public, so the position of the Royal is unusually strong.
The profits, as compared with capital and reserve fund,
show a slight diminution, but for that the recent large
increase of capital may be fairly regarded as responsible.
It takes a little time for the returns from new capital to
show themselves.

than in the case of most banking institutions.

These results are exceedingly good in every respect. The
Bank of Adelaide, which was never among the recon-
structs, is now far larger, stronger and more prosperous
than at any previous period in its career. It has always
been a reputable institution ; even in the worst of the
boom days it side-stepped the breath of suspicion in a
marvellous fashion. And all the time it continues to
grow. The latest report shows one new branch and two
agencies added to its ramifications.
Some further details are as follows :

Deposits have increased considerably ; but advances
have bounded ahead a little faster, and are in front by
£132,582. The £73,741 addition to liquid assets is a good
way behind the £163,259 of the ’O6-7 comparison. Still
the liquid assets represent nearly 54 per cent,
of all liabilities to the public and the Govern-
ment, which is something so amazingly above
the average that any' further addition would be
superfluous. Part of these assets—“ money at short
call, £710,000” —may represent Government funds
which are liable to early withdrawal, but even if
this item were left out the position would still look
remarkably strong. The Bank of Adelaide holds
£724,920 in Government securities alone, which
about equals its paid-up capital (£400,000) and reserve
fund (£325,000) put together. The year’s profits repre-
sent almost exactly 10 per cent, on the average of the
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves). Upon all
these and various other matters the institution has every
right to congratulate itself.

The Bendigo Co-operative Society, rising again from the
sea of disappearance with its balance-sheet in its mouth,
has nothing very cheerful to relate. The latest accounts
cover only five months, which partly explains the
fact that it takes so much less money to pay a 5 per cent,
dividend than it did at August, 1906. The other reason
is that in the interval the paid capital has dropped from
£7635 to £7lOB. With a net profit of £7B, after paying
for depreciation, and the guaranteed dividend, the pay-
ment of the ordinary Is. in the £ bonus to purchasers
was plainly impossible. The following table shows some
things that have dropped and some that haven’t:—
August, January,
1906. 1909.

Owing to Merchants .. 4498 7,148 Increase £2650
Overdraft (less cash).. 14 1,384 ~ 1370

Due by Customers .. 3895 5,162 ~ 1267
Capital .v .. .. 7635 7,108 Decrease 527
It isn’t a good showing. There are less profits, less sales,
less bonus, less capital, more owing to merchants, more
owing to the bank, more stock on hand to eat its head off
in interest, more due by customers (which means more
liability to bad debts), and a stationary mortgage.
The main trouble seems to be that the co-
operators won’t co-operate. There are 1393 shareholders
in the society, yet the grocery department, with the
second largest tally of customers, had only 1067 —“many
of whom are not shareholders.” Bread attracts 1418 ; but,
with the grocery figures in view, it would be vain to
assume that the number includes all the shareholders.
The drapery, with 590 customers, and the boots with 593,
are the two places the shareholder seems to stay away from
most consistently. The chairman said he thought it was
“senseless folly that people should put money into a
society and then let it dry rot.” No reason appears to be
forthcoming as to why the shareholders withhold their
custom. The bread and boots show “fair profits”; the
grocery and drapery are on the debit side. It is the first
time grocery has shown a loss. Also £258, which the
society might have collected in discounts if it had had
the means to pay cash, was lost because it hadn’t the
means to pay cash. The bakery department, which is
still paying, is expected to be a losing concern next half-
year owing to the rise in the price of flour. If this
happens there will apparently be only boots to rely upon.
It is a sad story of co-operation gone wrong.

Of the half-year’s profits, £25,000 has been set aside as
provision for rebuilding and depreciation of securities.
This represents an increase of £lo,oooover the usual h ..f-
-yearly appropriation for this item; however, for t.m
period just ended the regular £lO,OOO addition to me
reserve for the equalisation of dividends has been
dropped. This fund now stands at the even £lOO,OOO,
and as the populace seem to be more enthusiastic than
ever about beer, and the profits show no signs of shrink-
ing, the directorate have put it aw'ay for the brick that
moulders and the stock that slumps. The total of
£279,080 is thus made up of plain ordinary reserve,
£lOO,OOO ; reserve for equalisation of dividends, £lOO,OOO ;
reserve for rebuilding and depreciation, £50,000; and
undivided profit, £29,080. The usual £5OOO has been
written off to provide for depreciation of plant and
machinery. The profits continue to climb upward, and
the present half-year is £3Ol above the previous high-
water mark of March, ’OB. Another view of the situation
is this :

As will be noticed, “profits on brewing, etc.,” has hopped
up £2272 since last year ; and, when you compare it with
the £132,377 of 1900, you are inclined to agree with the
hard-working comedian who remarked, “ Beer is money.”
No explanation of the tremendous increase is given—
simply the figures are produced. The co.’s debt to the
public has moved up to the extent of £9680, and “ proper-
ties, goodwill, plant, etc.,” have increased by j. 23,044.
The following comparison puts March, ’OO, shoulder to
shoulder with March, ’O9 :

The liquid assets have increased by approximately 50 per
cent, in the short space of nine years ; and all the time
the dividends have been falling out of the beer-pump
with a regularity beautiful to behold. The only peg
whereon the carping critic can hang his hat is the intangi-
ble thing in Table 11. called” Goodwill.” It is impossible
to gauge its size, as it is tangled up with properties and
plant. The amount ought to be (1) stated, (2) written off.

This co. seems at last to have arrived at the conclusion
that the game isn’t worth the interest. The’oB report
breathed a faint hope that the directors would be able to
“ make satisfactory arrangements for the works to be
revenue-producing during the coming season, although,
owing to the continued absence of rain, the prospect at
the present time is not encouraging.” Now the ’O9
report arrives with the information that the hopes of last
year came to nothing ; likewise it states “ the funds of
the co. being practically exhausted, arrangements have
been made with the debenture-holders whereby sufficient
money has been advanced by them to meet current ex-
penses until the works can be either leased for the
coming season or disposed of.” Judging by the co.’s
experience, the chances of the directorate doing
either are not rosy. The £15,000 worth of deben-
tures which constitutes the skeleton on the roof
of the unemployed works were originally payable in
1906, but were extended to 1909 ; apparently, the holders
are not agreeable to renew for another term, but will help
the co. to hang out until the possible purchaser happens
along'. The co. does not appear to have ever paid a divi-
dend ; of late years ic has earned half a crust now and
then by leasing the works ; but the nominal reserves have
been dwindling pretty steadily for about seven years,
until the management is now constrained to admit that
things have arrived at bedrock. An illuminating sentence
of the report is that wherein it is stated the interest on
the debentures for the year ending March, ’O9, has not be
paid ; you can’t induce the mereiy-human debenture-
holder to go away and call again in another three years
under such circumstances. However, itisdoubtful whether
there would be any profit in so doing. The record of the
last few years is mostly rust and decay ; and the outlook
—so far as can be seen—is more decay and more rust.
Tiie plain bald statement that they are going to try and
sell the concern would seem to indicate that those in-
terested are weary of sitting in the wilderness waiting for
a good season to send the flocks and herds clattering up
to the front door like the live stock of Noah immediately
prior to the Deluge. In the dim, remote future, the way-
back freezing works may be a paying business; but it is
a future too faint and far away for the man who has in-
terest to meet.
“ H.G.”: An eloquent commentary on the pre-
sent control of fish throughout the Eastern States is the
estimate of one authority in respect to the catches of the
Federal trawler. So far the Endeavor has done splen-
didly. The returns, considering the time the trawler has
been absent from port, have be. n equal to those of the
North Sea —the richest fishing ground in the world —but
so utterly crooked and badly organised has the fish supply
of Melbourne and Sydney become that it would not pay a
private company to start trawling even on this basis.
What, for instance, is the reason why the people of
Sydney do not obtain barracouta for a few pence each, as
do those of Melbourne? The'couta is a blessing to the
poor residents of the southern city, where a fish big
enough to provide a meal for a family of five may
be bought for 3d. or 4d. Granting that the
’couta is a coarse fish, still there are many who
like it. Even if the ’couta were retailed at 6d. it'would
provide Surry Hills, and Pyrmont, and Botany with cheap
food, and should leave a fair margin of profit after pay-
ing carriage from Melbourne, for it must be remembered
that 4d. is the maximum retail price on the hawker’s
barrows in Melbourne, and is charged only after much
middle profit has been paid. To start with, the Fisher-
men’s Union of Queenscliff, where the 'couta are mostly
caught, restricts the catch to a boatload a day. When
two members of the union have filled their boat
they have to knock off work, even though the
sea is stiff with the fish, the object being- to main-
tain a uniform price in the Melbourne market. This
restriction means a lot. In certain seasons the supply
of ’couta is practically illimitable, and 10 or 12
boatloads a day could be caught by each pair. On top
of this, the Queenscliff railway service does not suit the
times of supply, and the fishermen have to send their
catches to Melbourne by the bay excursion steamers,
which have a monopoly of the business, and charge mono-
polist freights. In the city, the union does its own
auctioneering, but it was shown a few years back that
when fish did not bring a certain price, the union office
had a way of destroying the surplus rather than allow
the price to come down in open competition. All things
considered, it is probable that ’couta could, at times, be
sold in Melbourne and made to pay at Id. apiece, while
the maximum should never be more than the 4d. now
charged. There are occasionally outcries about restraint
of trade; but, in respect to the ’couta supply of
Melbourne there is nothing but restraint of fair trade on
the part of everybody who handles the fish. Private
Enterprise could not inaugurate a system of ’couta supply
to Sydney, owing to the fear that one of the other links
in the chain would turn dog. The States of N.S.W. and
Victoria might organise a Fish Department, headed by a
Minister for 'Oouta, but they are too busy yapping at the
Commonwealth to trouble about the wants of their
people. Only the Commonwealth itself is left, and as,
sooner or later, the pqp er must be obtained to supply
the catches of the Federal trawler to the people of the
seaboard, it should at the same time consider the possi-
bility of reducing- the excessive cost of living to the
poorer residents of Sydney by bringing the r couta to their
doors. If the trawler itself happens across a ’couta
ground close to Sydney so much the better.

The recent Labor Congress showed no super-
fluous wisdom when it carried a clamorous motion for the
abolition of first-class carriages on the railways. The
reason assigned was that the second-class carriages re-
turn all the revenue, while the firsts are merely a non-
paying concession to the bloated rich, which looks a very
impressive statement until it is reduced to figures. Then
a certain doubt arises. For instance, during the year
ended 30th June, 1907, first-class passengers in N.S.W.
paid £503,555, and second-class passengers £984,124. To
earn this money there were employed 204 first-class and
411 second-class carriages ; also a miscellaneous welter of
special cars, sleeping cars, composite cars, and brake vans,
which last, in some cuses, are also partly passenger cars.
This welter it isn’t very easy 7 to sort out. But taking the
number of plain first and second class vehicles, it cer-
tainly seems that the first-class box on wheels earns its
bread and cheese quite as well as the second. As to the
story about first-class carriages being empty while their
less luxurious brethren are crowded, anybody who sees the
morning suburban trains come into Sydney' with even the
platforms of the first-class vehicles crowded, knows better.
Even if the first-class were used solely by the enemies of
the worker, there is no reason why these enemies should
not be permitted to pay for luxury in railway travelling
any more than for luxury in food or clothes or public
entertainment. To be logical, the Congress should pass
a resolution deploring the existence of any other than
sixpenny meals, and call upon Prime Minister Fisher to
reduce the accommodation at the Hotel Australia to the
level of the Salvation Army Refuge. Further, it should
demand that the theatre should be all gallery at Is. ad-
mission money. This idea of demanding that the bloated
capitalist should be compelled to travel cheaply so that
he may save money and bloat further seems an ill-judged
business.

Nowadays when Solemn Lee, N.S.W. Minister
for Works, is met bv a deputation which wants a railway,
he works off a dreary'gag to the effect that “pending a
settlement of the financial relations between the Com-
monwealth and the States ” nothing can be done. This
means, of course, that the Wade-Lee Government is
seeking to raise a g-reat popular clamor against the
financial proposals of the Australian Ministry, and it
begins by' refusing new railways (which it would probably
have refused in any case) and hinting that they would be
granted but for the Federal Government, and that they
may' yet be granted if the Federal Government proposals
are knocked out. It is a mean dodge, and a thin one.
When N.S.W. was a separate State with a small revenue,
it built its railways out of loans. When it become a
Federated State with a greatly-increased revenue, it
built its railways out of loans. Under its hard-borrow-
ing State Premiers revenue has nothing to do with
railways. And these people whose line was refused last
week on the strength of the old gag should note that the
Wade-Lee Government has undertaken to pay, if neces-
sary out of the State Treasury, about £1,000,000 for a
Dreadnought. If that matter didn’t require to wait
“ pending a settlement of the financial relations between
the Commonwealth and the States,” a little back-blocks
railway need not wait either.

P’ran (Vic.) Council is the hero of what a daily
paper calls “an adventure in municipal economy'.” A
while ago it erected a rubbish destructor for the disposal
of the local garbage ; and as the heat was all going to
waste, the council decided to have it turned into elec-
tricity. Thereupon the council erected the necessary
plant and turned out electricity', which, by a masterly-
stroke of diplomacy, it sold to a Private Enterprise
electric light co. at less than Id. a unit. Meantime, the
same co. sells back the same electricity in the form of
light to the council at something like four times the price.
So the council sells its electricity at, say, a copper
to show the intelligence of its municipal economy,
and buys it back at about fourpence—apparently to show
the economy' of its municipal intelligence.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing emploj’ed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best solid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Letnpriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
fine wet screen, and this is what all the mining world has
been seeking; it is also equally effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers, and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
The machine is fully protected V>y patent rights. For

dusty little township on the cattle plains of Ohinemun ;
to-day it is a prosperous city'. But, b.v the irony of fate,
not one of the surviving original prospectors of the pro-
perty retains a pennyworth of interest in it. When first
worked in the surface levels of Martha Hill the main ore
body was believed to be unpayable. There was then no
cyanide treatment, no method of dealing profitably with
low-grade ores, and the owners were finally glad to let
the mine on tribute. Even the tributers could not make
it pay, and the property was purchased by Thomas Henry'
Russell for £3OOO. To date this immense low-grade pro-
position has yielded over £7,000,000 worth of gold and sil-
ver, and paid £3,500,000 in dividends. All this in 16 years.
The distributions since 1893 have been on a regularly' in-
creasing scale, and that vear 3s. was paid ; next, 4s. ;
then Bs. till 1900, when half-a-sovereign w'as handed out ;
in 1903 125., 1905 135., 1906 155., 1907 165., and this year
with the bonus £l. The shares to-day are worth over £9
a-piece, and buyers of a few' years back have nearly doubled
their money'. Present annual distribution means £500,000.
Waihi is rapidly' forging to the front among the world’s
big bullion producers. There are six main shafts, and
some 16 lodes are being worked, among them the Martha
and branches (the original name of the mine), Empire,
Royal, Edward and Welcome. No. 9 level (1000 ft.) has
been responsible for the best recent developments. A
notable point is the large scale upon w'hich development
work is done. There is no necessity’ for the tallest man
to stoop in his passage through the labyrinth of drives
and crosscuts ; many of the former have been so widened
and ore has been taken down from such a height that
they’ look more like railway tunnels than anything else.
In some sections of the Welcome lode stoping is proceed-
ing on widths up to 120 ft. To show' how immense are the
principal ore bodies, it may be mentioned that in many
instances two parallel drives have to be taken along
the lode on the same level to facilitate working. In-
dications are that values persist with depth. The ore re-
serves are estimated at a million and a half. This is on
a conservative basis. Figures weary, but the Royal lode
for 1700 ft. averages 30ft. in width, the Empire the same
for 1200 ft., and the Martha reef is 90ft. wide for 1800 ft. ;
the distance in each case being the limit opened up. The
El ward lode in the south-west crosscut at No. 8 is 75ft.
wide, assaying £lO per ton from wall to wall. Gold,
curiously enough, is seldom seen in the ricoest Waihi
ore. The full crushing capacity at the three mills is 330
head of stamps.

A new tin-field (alluvial) has been lately dis-
covered near Pine Creek, in the Northern Territory. Tin
ore is found for nearly six miles along the creek, hut, on
account of excess of water, little can be done at present
to test and decide the capabilities of the field. At pre-
sent, some 15 or 20 men are at work, up to their knees in
water, stabbing blindly' with shovels for the wash, and
making up to £1 a day at the work. The tin ore
obtained is mostly black, with some brown, ruby', amber
and W'ood tin. There is said to be a bigger and better
find of alluvial tin made some six miles from this locality’,
at a place which is to retain its native name of “ Umbra
Warra.” It is recommended by the warden, who paid a
visit to the field, that the place be proclaimed a new
goldfield, as provided by Clause viii. of the Northern
Territory' Mining Act (1003), so that, for thre years at
least, it will he closed to aliens, and open only to Euro-
pean miners. Meanwhile, Chinese have been notified that
they'will not be permitted on the field. It is expected
that Umbra Warra will carry' at least 100 white men,
who will make wages and perhaps a trifle over. It is a
poor man’s field, but absolutely useless for the Southern
miner, as all claims will be pegged before he can arrive.

The Queensland Mines Department reports for
1901 a decreased mineral production. The total value is
£3,844,487, a deficiency of £287,677. Gold and silver
together show an improvement of £18,330, arid the above
drop is due to lower values of minerals “other than
gold." For example, the copper conten’s of Mount
Morgan ores were worth £9224 less than in 1907, although
the output was 1600 tons greater. The lower prices for
wolfram and antimony have played havoc with the pro-
duction of these two minerals, the latter being almost en-
tirely'neglected. Regarding the various fields, Mount Mor-
gan’sgold output was worth £640,879, outof atotalforthe
State of £1,975,554 ; while its copper, valued at £375,409
was also about one-third of the total. Copper from Mun-
gana was worth £104,102, and the silver lend ores from the
same place £L20,000. The silver lead and copper ores
from the Silver Spur Mines at Stanthorpeyielded £24,257.
Oloncuiry produced £36,624 more than the previous year,
the total being £94,737. The contribution of the Explora-
tion Co. towards this sum was the value of 916 tons copper,
1180 oz. gold, and 5050 z. silver. Mount continues
to ship small parcels of rich ore, and several other shows
are accumulating ores for future treatment.
Various statistics contained in the above report
arc of interest. Of 173 casualties 33 were fatal, 107
serious, and 33 of minor degree ; while in 1907, 15 were
fatal, 110 serious, and 16 minor. The death-rate per 1000
in 1908 was as follows: Metalliferous mines, 2'l (0'84);
coal mines, 1‘79 (0 - 00); all mines, mills and reduction
works, 1’61(0'70). The figures in brackets are for 1907,
which was an exceptionally good year. The Mt. Morgan
disaster and three fatal accidents in coal mines have in-
flated last year’s figures. During the year 16 new mines
were opened, 10 old ones were re-opened, and 43 were
closed down. The figures for development work are :
shaft sinking in gold mines, 12,797 ft. ; in copper mines,
10,571 ft. ;in other mines, 3305 ft. Drives, crosscuts, and
other developments were : In gold mines, 87,231 ft. ; in
copper mines, 27,771 ft. ; in other mines, 8415 ft. The
general result is a falling off, except in the case of
Cloncurry.
The affairs of the Queensland Copper Co. at
Mount Perry (Q.) are far from satisfactory, and it is more
than likely that the smelters will be temporarily closed
down before long: The deal in connection with the New
Anniversary mine at Herherton was not completed, and
the formation of a new company to work the mine is in
the hands of Lovedale, of Mount Molloy'; whose scheme
has been accepted by the syndicate. He proposes to
form a company with 40,000 £1 shares, 25,000 to be issued
at 2s. With a 10s. bonus, making them paid up to 12s.
The Mount Molloy' Co. is to underwrite 15,000 shares,
leaving 10,000 available for the public. The vendors
receive 12,500 full,v-paid-up shares only on the under-
standing that work is to be started forthwith. A number
of the smaller surrounding properties are included.

Good work is being done on the Glassford Creek
(Q.) mine for G. C. Wilcocks and partner, who have under-
taken the development of the property'. The work is
being carried out under the direction of Finlay, the
underground manager of the late company. At 70ft.
below the “ Blue Bag ” drives have been put in north and
south, and on the south end the ore exposed for a distance
of 25ft. has shown values from one to 10 per cent, copper,
and as high as 6dwt. of gold. The average is probably
between 3£ and 4 per cent, copper and 3dwt. of gold.
Development to date is at least encouraging.

From Charters Towers (Queensland) a chorus of
praise is sounded by sharebrokers, warden and State
Geologist on account of the Day Dawn reef, which, taking
the east and west shoots together, has proved payable for
5000 ft. Total dividends run into something like
£2,000,000. The eastward extension of this reef is a mat-
ter of great consequence to Charters Towers. There
isn’t, however, a scrap of proof to uphold so many fine
anticipations. The end of No. 7, which is the most
easterly extension of the Day’ Dawn, is in a barren face.
The end of No. 5 level, driven 300 ft. in the East Mexican,
is also barren. The Brilliant P. C. should have seen
something of the Day Dawn in its deepest workings, but
the formations met with were exceedingly poor. Poverty,
of course, doesn’t prove that these formations were not
the Day Dawn formations. There is a chance that in
sinking shafts something may be found, and quite a
ripple of excitement was caused when the Brilliant Block
and Brilliant St. George struck formations and small
quartz veins, and when Clark’s Brilliant shaft entered
likely-looking country'. But the latter is nearly 1900 ft.
east of the payable Day Dawn workings, and the distance
is a big jump, considering all the intervening slides and
crosscourses and changes.

Bonnie Dundee, Charters Towers (Queensland),
made enough profit during its last half-year to pay £6OOO
in dividends. It has now a small fixed deposit, and its
last crushing of 332 tons for £2060 having turned out
well, it is able to pay another sixpenny dividend. Some
of the stopes are getting exhausted, but the improvement
in the top level and No. 3 is prolonging the life of the
mine. All the same, shares do not advance much. They
would probably do so if the winze going down below
No. 4 met with heavy mineral. No. 4 is also to be ex-
tended eastwards, and may' possibly get better stone.

Silver Spur, at Texas (Queensland), is close
enough to the border to take its supply of coke from Ash-
ford (N.S. YV.). Few people know that there is a coalfield
at Ashford on the Severn River, so quiet does this old
settlement keep itself. Silver Spur is 30 miles from the
coal mine, and the coke is to he used to run a water
jacket furnace. The main shaft is down 420 ft., and a
large lode has been exposed in the south drive. Stoping
is going on at the 300 ft. level, and the old reverberatories,
which use up so much timber, are unequal to the task of
breaking all the ore. It is expected that 100 tons of ore
per day will be smelted.
•* * * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers (Queens-
land), has declared another sixpenny dividend, and has
£4OOO on fixed deposit. This mine has driven some of its
levels with fair average values of mineral stone, which is
generally split into hanging-wall and footwall sections.
On the other hand, it is well to remember the broken
and unpayable parts of this reef, which are the reason
why only nine dividends have been paid during the long
life of the mine. What used to be called the Deep
Levels (now Brilliant Deeps) also proved hundreds
of feet of wretchedly poor levels, and it re-
mains to be seen whether the rich patch met
with at a depth of 2413 ft. will develop into a payable
mine. The fact that this shoot of stone is many hundreds
of feet from any other payable reef makes it exceedingly
difficult to identify. From its general characteristics, it
has been called the Brilliant, hut, strictly speaking, only
one main fissure can be called by the one name, and
formations which are sometimes very' wide apart are
reallv separate reefs.

Queensland Exploration (Cloncurry) seems to
be forcing the pace, and only an exceptionally-rich mine
could withstand such a compulsory' system of produc-
tion. Nearly all the sulphide ore is coming from between
the 250 ft. and 200 ft. levels. Last month, (March) 2100
tons of ore and fluxes returned 213 tons of 58 per. cent,
matte. The ore seems fairly easy to smelt, because only’
323 tons of fluxes were used in smelting 1777 tons of ore.
Every effort is to be made to make up a good return for
Aprii ; furnace bottoms, flue dust, slag, etc., are to be
smelted in one of the reverberatories.
Developments of the Great Australia (Q.)lode at
300 ft. vertical are being anxiously watched. So far only
niullncky low-grade stuff has been met with. The winze
which is going down to meet the drive is also showing
poorer prospects. The rejoicing because some of the re-
fractory quartz gangue was replaced by lime —which
made the ore easy to treat—has given place to disap-
pointment now that the lower levels have become mul-
locky'. It is quite possible, however, that conditions will
change again. Bore hole prospects point that way ; but
they are not much to depend upon.
* * * *
At the MacGregor copper mine (Cloncurry,
Queensland) a good deal of importance is attached to a
seam of calcite (lime) passed through in sinking the shaft.
Because calcite replaced some of the refractory quartz in
the Great Australia lode (Queensland Exploration) and
made smelting tolerably easy', a theory is built up that
the excess of quartz and silica found in most Cloncurry
mines will, as depth increases, change into an easily-
treated calcite gangue. But there isn’t much to found a
general theory on, and the MacGregor, at a depth of
220 ft., has still far more silicious ore and
quartz than it likes. The shaft at 339 ft. is
in a hard quartzite bar, and the seam of cal-
cite overhead is only a fe.w inches thick. At
310 ft. along the north drive assays average 5 p.c.,
and the crosscut that was put in to the west to
prove the width of the ore body has passed through 17ft.
of low-grade silicious ore. No doubt the rich ore, as des-
cribed in the report, will help to sweeten some of the low-
grade stuff, so things are not so hopeless as they might
be. MacGregor had something like £30,000 a while back,
and some of it is invested in Etheridge railway' deben-
tures. This group of mines requires a smelting plant, and
there is much mine development to be done, so a good
deal of money will be used up. It rather staggers one,
however, to find that last year no less than £lB,OOO was
spent.
Mining matters at Wyalong (N.S.W.), which
have been in a depressed condition for some time, now
show signs of a revival. The True Blue Co. has again
struck excellent mineral ore at the 1200 ft. It should yield
from soz. to 12oz. gold per ton. At Neelds indications
are more promising than they have been since the firm
started prospecting at the 900 ft. level for the lost chute
that was worked down to 300 ft. with such satisfactory
results in the early days of the field. Mr. Pittman, Chief
Inspector of Mines, has been on a visit, and from an
inspection of the Blue, Neelds, and other properties is
satisfied that Wyalong has got a kick or two left.
* * * *
Kangiara (N.S.W.) talks of sinking the shaft
another 100 ft., and is working out a scheme to smelt its
lower-grade ore, to lessen the heavy cost of hand-picking,
bagging, carting, railage, and other returning charges
from the smelting works. So much has been said about
the richness of the ore that it is just as well to consider
some of the costs. Picked lots of ore have been sent away
to Cockle Creek and Port Kembla. A list of seven ship-
ments make up 346 tons, and the agreed value of this
ore, including gold and silver, is approximately £l2
per ton. In all, 110 tons of lead ore averaged
55 per cent., and gold and silver bring up the total value
to £l2, w'hich, by the way, is about the same as some of
the Broken Hill concentrates are worth. A more recent
shipment gave 58 per cwt. lead, 230 z. silver, and Idwt.
gold. Kangiara has only' to increase its shipments of
this rich ore to make substantial profits, but tonnage is
not a strong feature, and Kangiara doesn’t take outsiders
into its confidence and say how long it takes to get out
110 tons of picked ore. Obviously it wouldn’t take long
if all thfe 6ft. of ore mentioned in the reports w'as the real
article. A glance at the pay-sheet would astonish some
of those enthusiasts who fix their faith on assays.
Great Cobar (N.S.W.) produced 479 tons of
copper for month ending March 7, and this is easily a
record for the new' plant. Gold and silver output shqws
a considerable falling off. This company does not publish
tonnages, but the output of copper indicates something
over the 20,000-ton mark—which is about 3000 tons above
the capacity of the old furnace plant. Continued troubles
with the new furnaces are put down to weak foundations.
Initial breakdowns were contributed to by a habit the
settlers got into of bursting because the expansion
magnesite brick linings had not been provided for. The
evil has since been remedied, but as things still continue
to go wrong, the last published output is likely to remain
a record for some time.
* * * *
C.S. A. Mines (N.S.W.) have shut down for six
months. The company has developed a large quantity of
basic ore, but its copper values are too low'. Its
prospective value is due to the fact of it being a
suitable flux for the higher grade silicious ores of the
Cobar district, and in this respect it is unique. The
co. has still a fair area of ground at the southern end of
its lease to prospect, and has been hoping that Gardner s
Block would assist by driving north. However, the latter
has kept religiously away from the C.S. A. boundary.
North Kangiara (N.S.W.) has been successfully
floated, and a start will be made at once to prospect the
ground. Surface indications are similar to those on
most other pieces of ground in the neighborhood. The
particular virtue possessed by this area is that it blocks
off the northern end of the Kangiara mines, and may
contain a continuation of the lode worked in that pro-
perty. The boundary' is 500yds. away from the nearest
workings, quite a considerable distance where minerals
are concerned. Developments will be watched with in-
terest by shareholders in the parent company'.
* * • *
Harden Gold Mine (N.S.W.) is preparing plans
for a new mill, and should make a very considerable cut
in milling-costs. These have appeared rather high in the
past on account of the plant being out of date.
• * * *
The last crushing of the Carrington United
mine (Queensland) was 614 tons. It returned bullion
worth £1933, and 75 tons of concentrates valued at
£IIS6, w'hich facts explain the interest that is once more
taken in these shares. After the disastrous experience
with its smelting plant, this company' found itself left
with low-grade ore and an overdraft of £13,000, the latter
representing the price paid for an insight into the smelt-
ing business. The plant at present consists of an
inefficient set of reverberatories and a Huntington mill
equipped with Wilflev and Card concentrators. The dis-
aster was assisted by the fact that the shoot of rich ore
w'hich had been followed from the surface slipped across
the boundary into the territory of the Nos. 1 and 2 East
company. The latter has only' a small area, surrounded
by the big company’s lease, and, as the shoot continues to
bear east, there is now little reason to doubt that it will
once more enter the Carrington United Mines property.
This means mining at a considerable depth, hut the
Towers men will certainly be on the track of the
lode if values continue at all promising. Present
milling operations are giving fair returns, but the
amalgamation and fine crushing of a gold-copper ore is
never likely to yield any extraction to boast of. It has
been demonstrated that the values cannot be economi-
cally' recovered by bulk smelting. Excess silica will have
to be removed by concentration. Roasting matte to
blister is also a procedure which will probably be omitted
from future smelting campaigns. As the overdraft has
been wiped out some profit should be made in future,
always provided the company' does not have another
carouse over the first patch of ore that is above ordinary'
grade.

Very few almonds show in the toffee at Wal-
halla(Vic.). Long Tunnel is opening up a nice formation
at the two deep levels. But w'hile the Board is content
to be told that the stone is “ payable ” or carries “ nice
gold,” the battery' has to be waited on to ring out results.
Poor Extended, next door, has no luck ; 150 tons for
500 z., 120 tons for 440 z., and so on, are records of low'
dirt. The first stope at 2900 ft. has been rushed along, and,
with the second stope opened, better grade quartz may
be available. If it goes -J-oz. it will only just pay' expenses.
The future turns on the stone betw’een the two deepest
levels and what maybe cut in the 3000 ft. crosscut. The
Extended people build on the old North Long Tunnel
ground, but The Bulletin has again and again warned
them that the £120,000 spent on that mine in the past
only' gave calls and sorrow. There is talk about the
Board meeting the shareholders to discuss the situation.
The chances are that the shareholders will rather cuss
the situation. Still, it would be well to meet. And it
would be still better if shareholders get an outside
mining man to tell them how they stand.
Great Southern, Rutherglen (Vic.), paid its
sprat every month so regularly that there w'as a rustling
of gowns when the break came. When the width of a
gutter is given at 800 ft. or 1000 ft. most folk think the
whole of the wash is pay'able. This little fiction can be
burst. Most of the gold is on one or other bank of the
old river, and if there has been a swirl or a curl, or a
tributary coming in then—(l) the gold may be scoured to
be deposited farther away, or again, the gutter may be
enriched. At the Duke United the tributary near the
shaft saved the mine for a while. At the Great Southern,
above the north branch level, the bottom is uneven and
patchy, facts that account for poor returns. Generally, the
gold lias fallen down to l2dwt., against working expenses
lldwt. This is a shrinkage of 6s. per fathom in values,
leaving so small a margin of profit that divs. become
next, to impossible. The company has a reserve of £4500,
which isn’t half enough. Low-grade ground occurs in
every' deep lead, and as the public isn’t inclined to pay
calls just now' a certain proportion of profit ought to be
bagged for future fodder. Some excuse exists for
dividend paying) as only £47,000 has gone back to share-
holders, against £99,000 capital paid by them. Still,
business is biz, and the sensible men who run the mine
ouvht to know that a margin of under £5OOO is not a
sufficient protection against calls.
* * * *
Next door to the Great Southern, the Great
Southern Consols is posing as a horrible example of what
oughtn’t to be. Shares lost 33 per cent, of their value
and set the world wondering. That is, except those sec-
tions of the world which had know ledge that the mine was
in an awkward plight. The old trouble—hustling out
wash when it was green, heavy ground and costly work.
Shareholders cannot afford to let this last relapse pass by.
So many nice things have been said and written for the
last five years about what the Consols would do that
what the Evening Noose calls a Coronial Inquiry is
w'anted over someone’s carcase. Have managers been
pushed into a corner to get out wash, or have they
failed to let the Board know the danger of tackling wet
ground? These are two out of a host of questions that
need to be answered. What drew attention to the drift
W'as the anxious faces of a little coterie of deep lead men
who don’t affect the Stock Exchange except when things
are buzzing one way or the other—mostly the other.
New Long-Thought-Of mine, Rokewood (Vic.),
is going to be the Dashed-Poor-Thought-Of, unless some-
thing radical is done. According to the directors, the
legal manager walked off with the books. Although he
was hunted after till the morning by an anxious chair-
man, neither books nor man, it is alleged, could be
found. This is not mining of the right sort, and petty
cash cannot be expected to stand such an extreme strain.
The co.’s auditor has reported that, out of a total of £522
received from the sale of shares, £179 cannot be traced.
He also alleges that the bulk of the co.’s banking was
carried on through the late manager’s private account.
With the co. in such a hole it is not neces-
sary’ to go into the merits of the mine. But
it is necessary to ask how directors let a bank account be
operated on in such a way. There should he no private
accounts in company matters. The first thing a Board of
Directors has to do is to check up the bank, next to
check up the bank book, to see that the scrip ledger is
0.K., and that there is a proper record of calls. These
points settled, the watching of expenditure is easy’.

Gwalia South (W.A.) held its half-yearly
meeting at Kalgoorlie on the 15th inst. Chairman Yeo
expressed satisfaction at the outlook, and reckoned that
if the new makes of ore recently exposed out west proved
to be as good as expected, the life of the mine—which is
now endangered on account of the Sons of Gwalia getting
the main shoot at a shallow depth—would be indefinitely
lengthened. He asked the meeting to back up the
Board as regards its action in withholding the dividend
until May, and, as no one took an opposite stand, he was
entitled to assume that it did so. No questions were
asked, and the two retiring directors were re-elected
without opposition. On the day of the meeting the co.
had £5900 in hand, £1547 bullion reserve, and a fully-
equipped mine.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, April 27- 1909,
My Dear Arinl
Ernest H. Shackleton cannot be fully apprecia-
tive of the importance of being Ernest. He gets
bushels of letters asking for his autograph, and
nearly every person whose name begins with S,
or ends with “ton” writes to claim relationship.
Most of his interviewers and most of the people he
casually meets must be a trial with their trivial
questionings. Personally speaking, I led off
(when I met him) with these queries :—•
(1) Was it very cold near the South Pole?
(2) Is pony-meat nice?
(3) Did you bring back many penguins?
(4) Will you go down there again?
He chortled and showed some snapshots of penguins.
One was of the chesty bird standing with his bill
pointing skyward as he crowed for a mate. His
solo would presently fetch a spinster penguin, and
by-and-bye, when the pair set up nest-keeping,
Mr. Penguin would feed his wife as she sat on the
eggs. He brought her prawns and the like,
carrying them in his gullet, into which she dipped
her beak. “Are the birds monogamie?” asked
the naturalist present. “That we could not
determine,” replied the Great Iceman. “We
frequently saw a male penguin feed another bird’s
wife, but we could not say whether his motives
were absolutely disinterested.”
“Charity thinketh no evil,” murmured the
naturalist.
“True, And the bird he fed may have been
his widowed niece.”
Shackleton resents the “ delusions ” (the word
is his) that he is a hero and that time must have
hung heavy on the party in the long Polar night.
They were never idle, and earned every ounce of
their seal meat. There was somewhat of a
return to the primitive—he would not call it
retrogression, but as to pining for the absent dear
ones, well, the dear ones left in the centres of
civilisation did the pining. They had some time
to do it in, whilst the dear ones in the centres of
desolation, though they had all the time there
was, crammed it with work—manual or mental.
Three miniatures on ivory in one little case the
sea rover carries on him : a handsome young
woman, a jolly little boy of four, and a chubby
small girl—they are his dear ones. He starts his
journey homeward next month. On Friday he
lectures in Sydney, the proceeds to go to certain
hospitals; on the Sunday follovving he leaves for
Melbourne, where he also speaks. The Dudleys
have harpooned him for dinner, and on another
evening he will tear a bit of food at Admiralty
House.
What a first-grade pirate of olden times
Shackleton would have made. His clean-shaven
face, his low forehead with bulging brows, his
locomotive-fender jaw, and strong deep-chested
figure give him the look of the sea-rover of fiction,
especially if your imagination sees him in top
boots, a jelly-strainer cap on his head, and a
swathe of red silk around his neck. Odds Blood !
When, at his lecture on Thursday night, he
showed a picture of himself as he was after his
three months of flannel (the same flannel) next the
skin, that picture showed him with a sinister
beard, huge and curling. He was the real thing in
Vikings and nothing else doing. His name was
Garth or Balder some such. S’death !
Shackleton stays at the Australian Club, works
in strict privacy with his secretary or runs about
Sydney in Professor Pollock's motor-car. At the
Governor-General’s ball he escaped from the dais
after bending the spine to the Lady, and went
and sat in a corner by himself. He seemed moody,
but perchance he only gloated on the fair scene.
Gad’s head ! May not a man sit by himself and
gloat? His picture films, insured for £20,000, are
now on their way to London, where the Daily
Mail has first call on what the explorer has to
show and say.
As a speaker, our partially-frozen brother
Shackleton is somewhat hesitating, but he has
a voice that could be heard through the
roll of war-drums. He spoke for but five
minutes at his Town Hall receptfon, and
the whole show was over at nine. Other
members of the expedition were on the plat-
form, and the girls liked Lieutenant Mackin-
tosh best, chiefly because he was fair and carried a
superior type of moustache. It looked like a
pedigree moustache—not the mere hair that you
can pick up anywhere. He had lost an eye, and
Baronet Brocklehurst a toe. Mackintosh has a
glass optic, but whether Brocklehurst has a brass
toe, even as Miss Kilmannsegg haa a golden
leg—anyway the matter is of no concern except to
himself. Cheers were given for Mrs. Shackle-
ton and the two little Shackletons, and the
audience dispersed. But as nine o’clock was
much too early to go home, the receptioners
went next door to the Cathedral, and looked at
Archbishop Saumarez Smith lying in state. Two
clergymen in surplice and cassock watched and
prayed. Purple drapery drooped around the walls
of the church, and the gold crook lay on the oaken
coffin.
The Sir Philip Brocklehurst whom Sydney met
for the first time a fortnight ago, and who has
claimed of right a fragment of the bright lime-
light that beats on all returned Polar explorers, is
an unusual type. He is but 22, and is immensely
rich. The ordinary affluent young man of his
time of life prefers to do in his cash in almost any
other locality than the South Pole. Not so the
subject under discussion. The South Pole is
with him a hobby. Nothing, he avers, but force
majeure shall stop him being there when the next
effort is made to get to it. And, if nobody else
appears, he intends to fit out a South Pole expedi-
tion at his own expense, and lead it at his and
its own risk. When not Poling, he is a natural,
fair-complexioned, pieasant-looking person, and
even in the blubber-and-fur over-coating, which
is the dress garment of the Far South regions, he
is said to look as seemly as most.
The Governor-General’s two elder daughters—
the demoiselles Morvyth and Honor Ward-
started their Australian schooling last Tuesday, by
going to Miss Badham’s academy in Forbes-street,
Darlinghurst. The girls have their hair looped up,
a fashion that the Sydney girl of 15 or under will
now rush with all her might. Hitherto she has
let it float loose until she got into her coming-out
frock. The Ward schoolgirls reach their place of
cram in a motor-car.
Mr. Edwin Geach was married on Thursday, at
Neutral Bay, to Miss Willis, a young Maoriland
member of his company. Mr. Jeffrey Hill
propped up the nervous groom, and Mrs.
Bussell, the consort of one of the legal firm of Sly
and Russell stood by the bride while Mr. N.
Montagu gave her over to Edwin’s permanent
safe keeping. Two of the Geach girls were
present. The bride wore a navy-blue cloth
tailor-made and a shrill-green hat, and went off
for a South Coast honeycomb.
Mention of the South Coast reminds me that
the proprietor of one of the summer resorts there
has a grievance that deserves airing in these
columns —if only as a matter of justice to accredited
correspondents. A female person, by masquerad-
ing as a member of the staff of This Bulletin,
was enabled to live for some weeks at
the proprietor’s boarding-house free of ex-
pense. No money equivalent happened along
for the loss of his ham and eggs and
roast lamb, and for the use of his hammocks
and kapok mattress and surf-bathing towels.
Rumors from other coasts and quarters lead me to
suspect that the masquerader is liberalising the
education of other boardinghouse-keepers. There
are no female persons on the staff of The Bul-
letin save your “ Akenehi ” in Sydney, and
“Johanna” in Melbourne, “Rosna”in Adelaide,
and “ Mario ”in Brisbane. Four in all, and we
are all at our posts and writing with more vigor
than legibility. And we don’t act the rdle of
locusts. And if we stayed at a hostel, most likely
we would be the last to own up to such a disre-
spectable thing as work. When we are on a holi-
day we try to look as if we wouldn’t know what
work was if we saw it floating in the soup.
The Edwin Geach wedding cake, a presentation
cookie, stood 4ft. high in its sugar. Amongst the
vast array of presents from theatrical co-workers
was included a safety razor. With such it is, I
believe, impossible for even an infatuated bride-
groom to spill his vital fluid to such an extent
that death will necessarily supervene.
Hon. Miss Jane Gathorne-Hardy, who inhabits
Federal Government House on a visit to the
Dudleys, is a daughter of Lord Medway and
granddaughter of the Earl of Cranbrook. Visi-
tors of this calibre ought to be welcome to Aus-
tralians. They go back and tell their kind that
we are not black and don’t dress in ’possum skins.
Our old Commonwealth nobility has taken up
the bait of the Christian name as the mouse
goes for the toasted cheese. Persons on the
dais or close to the edge of the carpet
at the Garden Party, have heard Lady Dudley
address the chamberlain as “Dick.” Someone
else is “Sandy” to her consort. Happy is the
fashionable youth who is simply named, and may
now be called Billy or Jimmy. Reggies and Guys
are outside designations.
A curious combination menu and programme
was sprung on the guests at the Arthur Allens’
big dinner and theatre party last week. The food
and the fun were named on the same card, and that
was decorated with scenes from ‘ ‘ An Englishman's
Home.” The play is over at 10.15, and Lord
Richard Nevill, who came in with two ladies at
10 past 10, was in time to see the final curtain.
The trio looked as surprised and hurt as the
Brown family do at the foreign invaders.
Of the deceased Primate Smith’s big family of
daughters, Mabel, who is now in England, had
the closest connection with Australia. She
accompanied her father hitherward on his
appointment to Sydney, and went under the
musical tutelage of the late Miss Woolley. On
returning to England, she passed for the
A.R.C.M. diploma, and launched out as a player
and composer. One of her sisters, Ursula, is a
clever ’cello player, and another, Katherine, a
capable pianist. Music was the deceased
Primate’s chief recreation for many years past,
and his daughters supplied it free of cost.
Tickets for the Montefiore Home Annual Ball
are out. The worthy charity has its dance at
Sydney Town Hall on Wednesday, June 2. The
president is Mrs. Francis L. Cohen; the vice-
president, Mrs. A. L. Lion ; hon. treasurers,
Mrs. A. Diamond and Mrs. Nathan Jacobs ; hon.
secretaries, Mrs. L. Packer and Mrs. David
Blashki.
Mr. Ernest Brooks, trekking Vic.-wards on
Friday night last, left £l5OO worth of his wife’s
jewels in a Sydney cab. He only discovered his
loss when he had settled down in a carriage of the
Melbourne express. The train hadn’t started,
but your genuine man of fashion does not lightly
abandon a comfortable seat and start fussing round
after lost property ; and so Mr. Brooks merely
directed a policeman to keep a casual eye open for
the strayed hardware, and then leaned languidly
back, and, so remained till the train departed.
There is something rather magnificent in this com-
plete repose of manner in a situation that would
stir the normal citizen to frenzy. I remember
encountering a man on a ferry-boat who had inad-
vertently left a Jew-fish, or leather-jacket, or
prawn or something in the vehicle which conveyed
him to the Quay, and his grief was terrible to wit-
ness. And yet the marine product was quite
dead, and it wasn’t worth anywhere near £l5OO.
Mrs. W. H. Weston, back from seven months’
journeying on the face of the earth, is adding to
the frockiness of the city by wearing a white
cloth long-tailed tailor-made, heavily be-buttoned
and braided. Another returner is Mrs. Dick
Horsfall. And a Tobin girl (an heiress from Mel-
bourne), who has also been abroad, looks the latest
fashion plate in toast color and a black extinguisher
hat.
I see that Ballarat has decided its love-letter
competition, which has now been running since
some time in last year. Here are some extracts
from the winning screed :
You ask me to forgive you. What can you ever do,
sweetheart, which for one moment could make me forget
what you are to me? Or that love which has made earth
heaven, and my life a joy ? Have Ito forgive the sun for
lurking behind the clouds, when he has shone on my days
and made them golden, or shall I welcome him the less
when he comes forth to warm me again ? Beloved, if I
have aught to forgive, it is that yon I hold so dear have
asked the question. I have no desire to know anything,
except that vou have loved me, and love me still. Faith
is unquestioning, for have I not crowned you king, and
my king can do no wrong! These eyes of mine, which
have closed beneath your kisses, are sightless until vour
lips unseal them ; my ears are deaf except to the magic
call of the voice of my beloved, and my heart has ceased
to beat until it can throb on yours. lam sleeping, and
shall awaken but at the sound of your footsteps. You
say, “ May I come?” Dearest, I am waiting.
The second prize went to the unlooser of the
following
Dearest. —The garden is just a wilderness of roses to-
day, a running riot of color in every corner, and in a few
weeks, or perhaps only a few days, they will have drooped
and dropped. There is usually something so subtly sad
in the passing of flowers that my whole mind seems
steeped in the wistfulness of it all. But this year it is
different; I have counted away each long mont hof your
absence on the calendar of flowers, and as each blossom
breathes away, it means one day less—one whole day
nearer. Do you remember that day, that day of days,
for you, when I showed you my hands full of violets?
You stooped and kissed them ; you mistook them for my
eyes; since then my whole heart seems to have leapt into
the violet. Each morning I search the leaves for just one
tiny bud. When that comes, you come. I have loved
every different flower as it budded, blossomed, and then
crept into the past. They have been all my thought, my
love for you excepted. M.v love is undying.—Yours till
the violet’s good-bye, Eleanor.
They are very beautiful and intense productions,
but I diagnose them as emanating from some dear
old lady who has not loved since the nonage of the
late Queen Vic. —if then. Here is a love letter
which I did not enter for any Ballarat prize, and
yet I think it is superior, artistically speaking, to
either of the ones that scored, for it is genuine.
A girl acquaintance of mine suffered me to take a
fair copy of it before she sent it to her latest young
man :
My dear old thing,—What in the name of goodness are
you snorting about now ? What if you did see me in the
Oentralia Autumn Garden with Billy yesterday ? Did I
say when I told you I was going shopping that I
meant to swear off all sustenance for the day ? The
suggestion is too absurd. I wonder you, who, with any
sort of luck, are now competent to earn a full 10s. 6d.
per week at the Bar, should entertain it for a moment.
No; I certainly don't want,you to swear off drink. Alii
object to, as I have told you many times already, is your
habit of calling on mother after your 27th whisky, or
whatever it is, and sobbing all over the new chintz covers.
It is a banal practice at the best, and it is intensely annoy-
ing to my family and to the maids. I don’t exactly want
you to be a teetotaller, as experience has shown me that
Che no-liquor racket renders you morbid and suspicious,
and otherwise offensive. The golden mean would seem to
be the thing —i.e., when you find tearfulness supervening
resolve to hire someone to drag you away and put you to
bed. You ask do I love you ? Mow what an appallingly silly
question. Would I take all this trouble over your welfare
if I didn’t? About the flowers for Friday night, counter-
mand them ; the wretched things die as soon as one puts
them on and they cost a fearful lot, and, anyhow, Billy is
getting me some. With the money you save you can run
round and get me that diamond spray we were looking at
in de Smythe’s window last week. Chin-chin and be
very, very good.—Your adoring Arabella.

the basement .she milks a cow, and the presence of
a motor with a girl seated near it suggests that
the vehicle with the toot in front and the slain
hen behind may be another means of earning a
roll and butter. Elsewhere the daughter of the
land makes sweets, or paints china as exhibited by
Miss Richards. The exposition of the Norland
Institute will be as a magnet to attract the girl to
infant tending and training, or she may make
lace,, or bind books, or do lithography. Two nice
girls are ironing all the afternoon of every day
this week. The girl as a washerwoman js not
represented, but as a mender, darner, ai d
renovator she is all there. On Friday Lady
L>udle3 r , arrayed in pale heliotrope, the color
that is supposed to attract the highest spiritual
influences, opened the Exhibition, and the young
person from three years to 23 years has crammed
it ever since.
The question—“ What shall we do with our
girls?” is answered by scores of professions,
trades and hobbies. But there was no equivalent
at the Ex. for the “smart general.” Had there
been an exhibit of a girl doing the work of, say,
four rooms —parlor, bedroom, dining-room and
kitchen—with what eager, greedy eyes would the
women (who are not faced by any problem re what
to do with themselves) have gazed upon the all-
round house-workee. Of specialists in housework
there is really no acute shortage, but the general
has all but finished the disappearing trick. One
registry office here has 30 orders for generals. And
since Easter Saturday not one general - has ap-
peared to seek even a “ light place.” Woe to the
missuses ! One day there will be.,three years’
compulsory domestic service for girls, just as there
will be compulsory military training for men.
Certain of the race-week balls were sanctified hv
the presence of a divine. He ministrates aboard
one of the warships, and when not actually en-
gaged on the job of soul-salving hears scant out-
ward resemblance to the conventional theological
expert. At evening functions he is a plain
ordinary young man as to his coat and the things
they swathe the piano-limbs with in Boston, but
severely clerical as to his waistcoat, collar and tie.
I don’t know if this is meant to be symbolical in
any way—indicating, for example, that albeit
doggedly spiritual in certain directions he is pre-
pared to be worldly to a limited extent in others
—but there it is. If he cures souls as skilfully as
he dances, the heavenly prospects of Ed. Vll.’s
tars now in port should be bright.
There’s another James Cassius Williamson now
on the outskirts of “the Firm.” He is a son of
tffce.J.C.W.’s brother, and therefore a nephew of
Himself. A good-looking young man is the new
J.C.W. He greatly resembles Uncle in appear-
ance, and his measured speech is very Jonathanish.
All good Americans, unless they be Anglo-
maniacs, are proud of their distinctive accent.
Some of Mr. Dan O’Connor’s friends in Sydney
assure others that the rumor of his marriage to a
foreign countess is solemn fact, and not mere
rumor. “ Just prior to the wedding,” say these
friends, “Mr. O’Connor won a £5O prize for the
best set of whiskers at a competition.” If the
countess and the whisker stories are true, the ex-
statesman will surely' bring his two prizes back
with him.
A new use for a miniature of your grandmother
or other and older ancestor: Take its hinged
cover off, get a long pin affixed to the back of the
miniature, and use your ancestor as a hat-skewer.
Such a skewer sat opposite me| in a tram just
now—at least the skewerist did. Her decoration
was a largish beautifully-painted picture of a
lady of the powder and patches time, covered
with a convex glass, and rimmed with gold. It
secured the hat from the left front of the crown,
and a blackbird stared permanently at it from
the other side of the headgear.
Returned wanderers by the same liner that
carried a certain Earl and Countess and their two
grown-up sons tell of the aristocrats’ amazing
economy. The lads had two pairs of white pants
each, and these they would wash in their cabin.
Their lady mother wore no underskirts, only a
skirt and serviceable bloomers. When she
ascended to the bridge the occasion made one of
the side-shows of the day’s programme.
1 hewed this sad outcry from the Adelaide
Register (15/4/’O9)
From “ A Mot,her” “ I think it, is disgusting the way
the governesses are going on. I had five last year, and
all wanted to do nothing but teach, and never soil their
hands, though they had £26 a year and beautiful board.
Whatever do they want? Two had very good offers of
marriage. Of course these things and good homes are
not counted—nothing but grumbling and no thanks.
I hope other ladies will have a say, and put a period to
such nonsense.”
It conjures up a hopeless picture. One sees in
fancy the kindly lady-mother in her home, with
its “ beautiful board ” (from which five govern-
esses retired in disorder during a single
year), and its culture and opportunities
for physical development by means of
useful toil. On the surface, it is pleasing
enough. But look closer. Its bosom warms and
nourishes a viper in the form of the sixth annual
governess. This person—T cannot bring myself
to term her woman—draws the lavish stipend or
honorarium of 10s. per week. Yet is she
dissatisfied. Nay, more; she is rebellious.
Little Bill has had his music-lesson (piano,
harpsichord and oboe); his sister Martha has
been heard her French verbs; the twins
have hearkened misunderstandingly to the basic
principles of surds; the Greek and Latin compo-
sitions of the family have been corrected ; evening
approaches. The day’s work of the governess, on
its intellectual side, is over. What more natural
than that the pampered creature should be desired
to swing an axe on the woodheap for half an
hour, and bluestone the terra-cotta lions on the
front-porch as preliminary steps to cleaning out
the fowl-house. The suggestion is put to her by
the lady-mother. Lo! she side-steps it. She
says that she is weary, or has home letters to
write, or advances any other paltry excuse of the
kind that occurs to her contumacious mind.
And so the billet of seventh governess yawns
for another. The sort of thing—this seeth-
ing discontent, and arrogance and contempt
of constituted authority, that is becoming
so manifest among the lower classes —is
the direct result of Australia not taking Mr.
J. Cook’s advice and going in whole-heartedly for
Anti-Socialism. “A Mother” errs in thinking
that the fact of “other ladies” having “asay”
in the Adelaide Register on the governess ques-
tion is going to “ put a period to such nonsense.”
Nothing but the return of Mr. Cook to power
with a large majority will be of the slightest avail
to produce educated females who will train the
intellects of the young, and when not so engaged,
will cut wood and dig the garden, all for a fraction
Over one shilling per diem.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

Why not have a Dance in
Your Own Home?
Now that the weather is getting cooler, you will naturally
be longing for a homely dance—the most delightful and
healthful of all indoor, cool-weather recreations.
The trouble with home-dances generally is the lack of a
good accompanist. If you do have one, then that member of
the party is debarred from participating in the enjoyment.
The way out of the difficulty is to buy an Edison Phono-
graph, and have it play you whatever music is required. All
the newest dance music is available, as played by the best
bands, and there is an almost infinite variety.
You have the Edison, not for one night only, but for
always, and in between the dances it is ready to provide items
of entertainment that you will all appreciate.
Buy one now, for the winter will soon be here. We will
gladly send you a full list of records and machines, and the
name of the nearest dealer. You can then call on him, and
hear the Edison for yourself.
The Edison Phonograph
will Provide the Music!

The average Australian business firm is pro-
gressing hugely on the artistic side. A volumelet which
Arthur Rickard and 00. have got together to advertise
the charms of Greenacre, a new residential suburb of
Sydney, looks more like one of those ornamental works
that are displayed on drawing-room tables than the
trade circular which it rightly is. On the outside a
chaste color scheme in green suggests one of those bind-
ings which the cultured Bostonian female demands for
her Shelley or Keats, and inside the beauty spots of the
site of promise are shown in a fine series of photographs.
Taken for all in all, the book is a boshter ; and there are
indications that the suburb which it advertises is in the
same class.*

The MOST DESIRABLE TYRE
Reliability, durability and efficiency may be considered
as going hand in hand as the first considerations in the
manufacture cf the most desirable Motor Tyres and
in no tyres will this trinity of features be found more
pronounced than in the ever-popular Continental variety.
The Continental Co.’s interpretation of the word
“reliability” is “ability to get there,’ and not only
to get there, but to get there well; to be certain at the
commencement of a journey that the end is in sight.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, April 26, 1909.
Mr Dear Yarrie, —
Practically the first dance of the season among
the Very Best People was given by Solicitor
Stewart, of the Mallinson, England and Stewart
legal institution, for the coming of age of his
adored granddaughter. The event was of such
importance to the old gentleman that he actually
returned from Sydney in the middle of a bowl-
ing tournament for the frivol. Only a hardened
and incurable bowler, such as he is, could
appreciate the monstrous sacrifice. The ball was
as brilliant as a March meteor. It was given at
the Heyington house. The Stewart palace
hangs on the high banks of the Too-
rakian curves of the Yarra, in the parts
where the maligned river is beautiful and
willow-fringed, and tops the hill with the flat-
roofed effect of an old Italian pile. Wide veran-
dahs spread out on terraces to the very edge of
this abrupt precipice, which is tangled with
wattle and willow. A complete and unabridged
supper of old-time splendor was served at numer-
ous round tables, like the one at which King
Arthur drank his olden refreshment, in the
roomy spread of the terrace. Electric lights were
hidden in roses and strung overhead, and a bliss-
ful orchestra played to a “dream” of a floor.
Miss Debutante Stewart, in her ninon and pearls,
had the best “good time” of any spoilt maiden
in the golden cradles of this city, and all the
youthful guests followed suit with enthusiasm.
It is a recognised fact that none but the church
paper is capable of striking the truly lyric note
when up against dull, everyday things like mar-
riage announcements. As a case in point, ex-
amine this, which is from the East St. Kilda kirk
monthly for April:—
The congregation will be sorry to learn that they have
lost their sweet singer in Miss Elsie Dwyer. She has
gone the way of many' singers before her, and sacrificed
her art to her affection. In sunshine and marital hap-
piness she now drinks the dews of the morning and
listens to the singing of the stars by night. Ad multos
annos.
She or he were a churl who hesitated to describe
the above as sweet —aye, bee-yew-tiful. Withal, it
is misleading. lam willing to bet £8 6s. 4d. to a
deceased boot that it emanated from the slim
white paw of a celibate curate with about
as much knowledge of the ways of a modern maid
with her young man as he has of the effects of 17
Manhattan cocktails absorbed in quick succession.
The old-world pastime of early-morning dew-
swilling is stone dead amongst up-to-date brides.
None but the veriest back-numbers go in for it.
And as for listening “to the singing of the stars
by night ’’—well, unless they are imported by an
impresario of note so that they attract a large
mass of the cither cats’ frocks within their orbit,
the normal hubby needs grappling irons to chain
his female encumbrance within sound of them.
The marriage of Mr. Thomas Bent and his
widow ladylove is said to be definitely arranged,
and the wedding tour planned. They are to
honeymoon in Maoriland unless the earthquakes
get too demonstrative. The arrival of Victoria’s
terrible ex-Premier is pretty certain to produce
an earth tremor of more or less violence.
Miss Frederika Meyer, a sentimental young
spinster with strong yearnings stageward, gave a
recital within the respectable shelter of the
Austral Salon walls —she had engaged the Salon
for the occasion—to an absolutely and ultra-
“ correct ” audience in evening dress. Sprinkled
among the audience were samples of the dilettante
young man. That kind of young man is skilled in
social graces, and he is often garnered in by the
Salon because he “tones” with the feminine
paintings ot flowers and the portraits of beauty
mummers that adorn those chaste walls. The
audience was backed up strongly by soulful yearn,
materialised into maidens of a subdued and
“ correct ’’artistic bent. Miss Meyer, in ghostly
white chiffon draperies, waved her arms as
at a seance, and recited to slow music. She
boasts a pleasant voice in its low and whisper-
ing registers, but any Attempt at dramatic
force brought a thin and tinny wail that
heightened the weird seance-y feeling. A gentle
trio, Miss Coral Trennerv, Mr. Felix Petsch and
Mr. Hermann Morris, played a soulful extract
from Mendelssohn. Also Hermann Morris mur-
mured an impromptu of Schubert to the piano,
while the reciter expounded Tennyson’s beautiful
“ Day Dream.” Claude Hall contributed some
of his favorite small love songs, and Miss Wagner
sang pleasantly through the lengthy programme.
At a recent big theatrical first night, the Puck
of the booking office was unfortunate in the way
he sorted people out. A divorced male person,
recently arrived from abroad, had with him the
parted wifeof an Australian matrimonial difficulty.
The combination was bound to be dangerous, but
the concern of the two half-parted people was
serious when the usher placed them side by side
with the lady’s ex-husband, who was accompanied
by the vision who had caused all the trouble
between him. and his ex-wife. This sounds com-
plicated, but it isn’t a patch on the real disturb-
ance that arose. Things soited out eventually
through kindly-disposed acquaintances changing
£eats with the disturbed scarlet crowd.
A pal, writing from London, speaks of the
success of Victoria Beatrice Miranda, the sister of
Lalla of the golden throat. Miss Miranda has
been singing with the Carl Rosa company for the
last few weeks. For her Elizabeth, in “ Tann-
hauser,” she gathered in special press notices.
The same girl snorts at the billing in a London
daily of “Bertha Bird, the phenomenal Aus-
tralian soprano.” Moreover, she extra snorts at
the clingsomeness of a London audience to a
favorite. She saw Maud Allan, the vaunted
danseuse , and saw a played-out show. The fact
that Londoners keep a show going for much time
is not evidence of merit—it is only evidence that
there are an immense number of Londoners.
A “name” is all a mummer or dancer
or singer wants in London. One single
“hit” starts the ball rolling, and by the
time it ceases to revolve, that performer
should have much money in the stocking. It
takes some time for a fairly large fraction of
London, say 1,500.000 people, to go and see for
themselves what this talked-of wonder is like.
They need not repeat the dose. Even at 12,000 a
week it takes many weeks to exhaust 1,500,000.
Millions are horrible things to get thinking about
—they take so long to count. So do billions. A
mathematical master in my early school-youth
staggered me by announcing that, had Adam
begun counting a billion in the early rural days,
he n might have “got there” about now—had he
lived. It seems to me that it might have kept
that muddled progenitor out of mischief.
J. A. Miller, who directs the prosperity of
West’s Pictures in Melbourne, possesses a brace
of daughters who do him proud. There are three,
in fact, but the youngest is not yet “out.” One
has been so useful in the Pictures business that she
—the fair Miss Phyllis—is to depart next month for
London and a long, restful holiday trip, as the
guest of West. The other, Miss Molly, a blue-
eyed girl with a temperament, a tip-tilted nose,
and a few teens to her age, has just returned from
an 18 months’ riot in Manila, staying with the
Joneses.
Jones is an American of importance, who
undertook to sanitate Manila with up-to-date
American sewerage, and a point of hurrah to
Australia is that every inch of piping in the huge
Manila-cum-American contract is being made in
Melbourne, papa Miller looking after the ship-
ment. Whenever the Melbourne girl showed
signs of home-sickness the Joneses would drive her
past vast piles of her country’s newly-imported
sewer pipes, whereat the young Melbourne lady
would breathe the familiar air and be comforted.
Trippers from Manila usually indulge in stories
that are hot; but the “ nice people,” according to
Miss Molly, don’t go the glad and giddy pace in
outward whirling. The “ cream ” entertain Jtq.
gether in their own homes, and do the polite and
legitimate form of fleecing with Bridge parties.
Their everyday programme seems to be to ( get up
with the lark, or its tropical feathery-tailed
equivalent, and do anything that in that lazy
land might be called work., (The natives —lazy
beggars ! —do the chores, and a white has half a
dozen of them to wait on her for each finger of
each of her hands.) Then the white man hoists
the white man’s burden by having tiffin, and
droops qff to a siesta. At four o’clock everybody—
all-the-world—us—drive on the Luneta, a serpen-
tine esplanade gay with side parterres of tropical
shrubs and with a band playing. The natives
are most musical. Their music is on a higher
plane-than the average nigger melody. Like the
negro minstrelsy, it is weird and haunting and sad.
The constabulary band that plays on the Luneta
has since toured the States, and there it was
counted one of the best.
A woman’s chief servant in Manila is her,
lavateur or washerlady. She is much more
workable and more considerate and cheaper than
her Australian prototype. In Manila it takes a
whole complete and extensive room for hanging
the week’s white dresses, just on their snowy
lone.
Miss Miller did not return to Melbourne by a
direct route. She journeyed in a roundabout way
that took her to San Francisco and such places,
and dumped back by a Vancouver boat for
Sydney. One of the Fleet pressmen travelled on
the same boat, hastening to his paper in Los
Angeles (Cal.). Clotworthy was the man—that
well-groomed personage among the visiting Fleet
inkslingers with a bearing like an important
statesman and a face that might have meant 17
years or 70. Clotworthv spoke of the Australian
reception with enthusiasm, vowing that it was
very much the best in the bunch, and that officers
and men enjoyed it most. At Manila there were
restrictions about going ashore. The plague was
raging, and great was the rage thereof. That
plague was a terrible thing. Only the most
excessive cleanliness among the whites made it
possible to avoid the scourge. Dishes, plates and
cups were taken from the native servant with
gloved hands and plunged into an antiseptic bath
on the sideboard in view of the eaters before they
were used. One boarding-house matron was almost
lynched or convicted of bigamy with violence
because of the merest deviation from the Only
Way, her deviation having led to the death of
some of her boarders.
In Japan Clotworthy remarked on the wonder-
ful attention to detail throughout the country. At
his first dinner in Japan he refused wine, and
mentioned that he did not drink it. At every
subsequent dinner (in other Japanese cities) given
to Fleet followers, he discovered his glasses
turned down, and no attempt at wine service was
made. The small matter of taste and character-
istic fads of everyone of that American company
was studied and sent on ahead to other com-
mittees, or their prototype, in Monkeyland.
Accuracy and detail are strong points with the
wily Jap—except when he wishes (as he often
does) to convey an inaccuracy to outsiders.
From “ Rosna ” in Adelaide :
Mrs. William Campbell and her daughter Alice are back
after a year’s wanderings. They hastened across Spain,
climbed over Scotland, slipped through Italy, and saw
quite a quantity of the small isle on which Edward VII.
sits wearing his golden crown and upon his golden throne
in the Tower of London. The charming daughter’s engage-
ment was announced just after her return, the prospective
Benedict being Mr. W. Strachan. Both prospectives are
still very youthful, so the sacrifice will not occur for
some time.
David Mawson, Adelaide’s special Antarctic lion or
Polar bear, came home from getting up the Pole last
week, and the ’Varsity boys played “See the Conquering
Hero ”in his train all over the landscape. They invaded
the station in bulk, and kidnapped Mawson under tile
very eyes of the Faculty, took him up to North Terrace,
put him in a handcart, and trundled him with much
triumphant bump and noise to the University'. They had
a brand new jingle, which they sang at him diligently'.
Professor David, when he was associating with seals and
other meat, wrote reams of nice things about Mr. Maw-
son, who is quite young but a truly giddy marvel in the
matter of intellect. But for him the expedition wouldn’t
have got as far towards the Pole as it did. So there now !
Adelaide scores again.
We had an epidemic of weddings the other Wednesday,
and old Hymen was worked so hard that he was found in
a fainting condition on his front doormat afterwards.
Early in the morning Loudie Pizey was joined to her
cleric, the Rev. E. W. Hines, who has the cure of
Anglican souls at Quorn. The ceremony was quiet, but
at 11 a.ni. the little bride’s friends were bidden to the
' Lyric Club, to wish her luck, and devour the festive
victual. She was one of the club’s first members, and has
helped to spread mirth and melody over its countenance.
But now she goeth forth to the wilds of Quorn, and the
Club pipeth its eye.
On the same day, the Holden-Peacock marriage spread
much traffic over the region of Flinders-street, and the
church had a ton of vegetation about its ears. And on
the same day St. Peter’s College chapel was beauteousl v
arrayed when one of the Seppelt damsels was made the
wife of Mr. Tandy'. This pair has gone wandering among
the Blue Alsatian Mountains, the South Sea Isles, and
other far-off places on a long, long honeymoon.
Nigel Brock ran through Adelaide on his way' to
Westralia last week as forerunner to the three Cherni-
avski youngsters. He only stayed long enough to glance
at his people and say that he would be back presently.
The complicated Russian or Polish youngsters, with
their sundry melody', have arrived, and are giving us a
brief season at the Town Hall. Their new Exes, have
showered their patronage on the infants.
The Rowing- Club closed its season with a thud on the
17th, and closed it so well that we defy anyone to open it
for another six months. The occasion was coincidental
with the christening by Mrs. E. VV. van Senden of the
new “eight,” and there was tea in the boathouse under
idyllic weather circumstances. We couldn’t have had
' better weather if we’d had the first coupon and reserved
it beforehand.
Down at Narracoorte they are discovering caves while
you wait. It’s most exciting. Early next month the
Admiral has promised to go down and formally thrust
open the very latest discovery, which is to be called the
Alexandra cave. The whole neighborhood is going to
sound the loud timbrel to celebrate the occasion. But
the neighborhood is so hollow with caves that if it sounds
too much timbrel it may fall right through and be swal-
lowed up. ....
Rather chill weather blew over Victoria Park for the
Chief Justice Ways’great Masonic garden spree on Friday.
Still it was fine, which was more than any good Mason
had the right to expect, seeing that the country is going
to the dogs or the elephants or some other mammals for
want of rain. There were flags by the furlong in the
atmosphere, and there was a sumptuous afternoon coffee
to be had in the tea room or at little tables outside. And
scrambling and tearing of hair were not. The hostess was
decked in a smart fawn raiment with beauteous applique
bespread on it, and pale blue plumes in her toque.
Mrs. Edwin Thomas wore a charming tailor-made prune
cloth, and a prune toque with a queer-toned blue feather
in it ; and Mrs. Mayfield had a braided black coat and
skirt, with forget-me-nots in a pretty toque. It was too
dull as to weather for very resplendent chiffons. The
Lewis Cohens were there, surrounded by a clan of old
friends ; and there were the Walter Wises, from Tas-
mania, and the David Griffithses, from Victoria, to say
nothing of 2976 more. One Mason came in evening dress
and a bowler hat, but he seemed very happy about it !
The late W. Shakspeare’s birthday party occurred at
the Lyric rooms on Friday eve, when the University
Shakspeare Society (which is so called because it has no
known connection with the University) gave a perform-
ance of said William’s works in fragments. You were in-
vited to same and asked to pay a shilling, and besides the
drama there was music. The show included a scene from
“Cymbeline,” and a scrap from “Romeo and Juliet,”
and an excerpt from “ The Taming of the Shrew,” and a
slice of “The Merchant of Venice.” The dressing of
“ Cymbeline ” was of a truly gorgeous style. Some good
work was achieved, particularly by two damsels, Ella Jiirs
arid Muriel Craigie. The former’s elocuting of “Portia’s
Lovers ” was a particularly bright circumstance.
Something new and thrilling in the prodigy line has
turned up on this horizon. It is a ten-year-old composer
infant named Merle Robertson, whom pianist Willie
Silver discovered at Petersburg or somewhere. He intro-
duced her to his students the other eve, and the kiddy
performed a Wedding March, “ Spanish Dance,” and
sundry other things of her very own composition—per-
formed them moreover with wondrous skill for her brief
years.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.
Thus The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant :
The Star of Saturday, in an article on the early post
offices of Sydney, gave a portrait of Mr. James Raymond,
the third postmaster, as being that of Isaac Nichols, who
was the first gazetted postmaster. Ikey came out in 1791
in the Admiral Barrington, and in course of time became
clerk to the naval officer or collector of Customs, Robert
Campbell “of the Wharf.” As clerk, Nichols had the
duty of collecting all rnailsfrom ship captains and sorting
the letters, etc. Acting-Governor Foveaux appointed
him postmaster, and Macquarie confirmed the appoint-
ment. His house in George-street was the post office.
Nichols died in 1819 and was succeeded by George
Panton. On his death, the office of p.-m. was
left in abeyance; the mails being sorted on the
premises of the Colonial Secretary and distributed
at the back door of the office in Bent-street. In 1829 Mr.
Raymond was appointed postmaster, and he held office
until his death on May 29, 1851. If Mr. Raymond knew
that he was doing duty per portrait for Ikey Nichols, he
would turn in his grave in old St. Peter’s Cemetery, on
the Cook’s River-road. The same article stated that
Nichols’ house site was now occupied by the fire-station
in Lower George-street. The fire-station stands where
stood Mrs. Reiby’s house. Nichols’s was further north.
“8.A.” discourses on the habits of some
Governors :
Lord Dudley’s uncompromising remarks at the Sydney
Agricultural Show to the appalling little men who got up
and squealed in his presence about the alleged follies of his
(Dudley’s) advisers ought to have been made long ago by
former holders of his job. The abuse that the present G.-G.
took exception to has been a regular feature in the past of
every public function, from club dinners to kirk-founda-
tion stone-layings which vice-regality and Fat attended
contemporaneously. A chronic victim of it was Lord
Northcote. He was an amiable person,,well-meaning and
right-minded. But he lacked strength of character. It
caused him anguish during the Watson regime to have to
sit and listen while Fat, under the pathetic delusion
that it was winning his approval, abused his Ministers and
all their deeds. However, he never summoned up the
nerve to protest publicly. His method was to send for
the offending orator afterwards, point out the “ gross bad
taste ” of his conduct, and implore him never to do any-
thing of the sort again—an utterly futile proceeding, of
course, and one that would only have been adopted bv a
total stranger to the country, and one who was imbued wi th
a false conception of the sense of decency possessed by
local Tories. ’ The politician invariably said he wouldn’t
do it again, and hastened to go back on his assurance on
the next opportunity. Governor Rawson was similarly
plagued, but he was a good, easy man, who
didn’t worry much about anything. No Governor
in the history of the Australian States has
ever abrogated such functions as a Governor pos-
sesses under the Constitution in so whole-hearted a
fashion as the bluff mariner who is now on his way to
England. Sir Harry declined to think for himself on any
toi ic. He left every blessed thing to his Ministers. If
they thought fit, which they often did, to rail at the
Opposition policy in his presence—well and good. He
argued that it was their affair. He was in the embarrass-
ing position of apolitical neutral, and gentlemen would
respect that neutrality ; but if it was his bad luck to be sur-
rounded by folk who didn’t know how to play the game,
the only thing was to take it philosophically. That was
the way N.S.W.’s ex-Governor explained privately his
public attitude in this regard. Of course he was never
placed in quite the position tha,t Lord Dudley was the
other day, inasmuch as his Ministers were of the Tory
persuasion during the whole of his tenure of office, and
Labor comports itself socially in a far more seemly
fashion than Toryism. But in any event there is no
reason to think he would have kicked. He wasn’t that
sort. Lord Dudley’s vigorous talk was good business
from a tactical point of view. (The crowd likes a straight
hitter.) Also, it is going to make things more comfort-
able for him personally as a fair-minded and self-respect-
ing man. And it promises to save future G.G.’s of his
way of thinking the unpleasant necessity of speaking
out. All round it was a shrewd and commendable move.
What Sir Lucius O’Trigger would call a
very pretty quarrel is that between Attorney-
General Wade and Mr. B. R. Wise, K.C., and
ex .Attorney-General. When Mr. Wise returned
to Sydney Mr. Wade officially asked if he were
willing to accept Crown briefs. Like Barkis, Mr.
wll]ir , „ all d e-ot briefs Then Mr Wise
” , was Wllllng ’ and £ ot bnets - Then Mr. Wise
thought it necessary to pass certain strictures, in
a p ure ly political sense, on Mr. Wade’s admini-
stration, and especially on his method of dealing
with the Chief Justiceship. After that the Crown
. . ...
briefs and the accompanying guineas were with-
drawn, and Mr. Wise wants to know “Why,” and
, TT , . , „ „ , ~
Mr. Wade says that he well knows the reason.
This reply Mr. Wise considers evasive, and
be sa y g that he has heard a rumor as to Mr.
Wade's reason hut the rumor is so discreditable

to Mr . Wade that he is loth to believe it. That

the matter as between YVise and Wade, but
there is another aspect of the case. Mr. Wise
published the correspondence in last Monday s
Sydney TELEGRAPH, and it included this letter :

“ Politics are vulgar when they
are not liberalised by history.”
POLITICS MEAN MORE in Australia than
they do in England, where Sir John Seeley’s
memorable saying loses something of its
appeal, for the simple reason that in England so
many people do quite well without politics at all.
To the Englishman, “the man in the street,”
politics are a distant and confused spectacle, from
which the great issues seldom emerge unobscured.
In Australia, on the other hand, there is no “ man in
the street,” and the great problems are very present
•in the less encumbered perspective. They have
been described as
a series of contradictions.
Australia’s commercial existence among the
nations still rests primarily upon wool, and the position
of a world supplier of raw products may be argued
to entail the correlative of free imports ; but the
country is devoted to Protection. Wool, again,
marches well with large holdings and a sparse
population, with a society highly individualistic and
patriarchal; but the country is devoted to another
ideal. The claims of centralization are obvious ; but
state rights and suspicions die hard. Australia of
the “ colonial ” days set up its house in a hemisphere
so vast and unclaimed that thought of the future
might well lose itself in the immense distances. The
nearer distance, indeed, remains vast enough to a
population of four millions in a continent of some
three million square miles. But meanwhile, in the
twinkling of an eye, the further horizons have closed
in. The overflowing East, astir at last, seems all too
near to. a land devoted to whiteness. Japan, the
United States, Germany, factors in the game un-
dreamed of a generation back, have- swept forward.
Australia finds herself within the currents of a
possible new storm centre of world politics, and with
what equipment ? She is part of an empire, com-
posite indeed, but capable of that naval predominance
to which alone, for years to come, Australia can
fairly look for security. How far, then, may she
reasonably indulge an inclination to keep for herself
what must yet count, if it is to count much, as
a contribution to a common fund of strength ?
Where do you get your opinions ?
Here are problems that invite opinions, nay com-
pel them—indeed, the burden of entertaining opinions
is one that none think of trying to escape. But
where do they come from ? How are they formed ?
How should they be formed ? For upon the attitude
of each individual in the community the issue
depends, and not upon the wisdom and foresight of a
few. They whose gift or trade it is to express
political opinions are accustomed to do so with a
scorn that should make such as think differently
ashamed to be wrong where it is so easy to be right.
But in his own mind every man knows that he cannot
be sure of following his feelings, or his party, or even
his favorite organ, to a sound conclusion, and there
are moments when party moves and anything like
special pleading seem as poor as feelings are crude.
One greatly desires a finer basis —and this is where
Sir John Seeley’s sentence has its application :
“ Politics are vulgar when they are not liberalised by
history.”
The school of political judgment.
The experience of the human race—there is but
this one school of political judgment, for it is all that
we know. The commonest of sayings in regard to
history is that it repeats itself, and it is this sameness
under infinitely various guises which, in giving history
its surpassing fascination, renders it also the most
potent agent of enlightenment. Land tenure ; the
relation between the state and the individual, whether
as regards taxation, the fostering of industries, or the
adoption of measures for the inducement of personal
good conduct; the status of religion ; the move-
ments of trade; the attempt to “level-up” between
the poor and the rich ; the relations of states to a
federal government, and of colonies to a mother
country ; sea power and land defence —these things
are precisely the material of history throughout all
ages and in all countries.
The oldest complaint in the world.
To imagine that political problems here and now
are something apart and radically different from those
which have been wisely or unwisely faced in the past,
this in itself is the beginning of political error. If
the history published by The Times did no more
than relieve its readers of this blindness, the benefits
would amply repay the labor of its production. What
has a more “ modern ” sound than the complaint of
decadence in a civilisation which has already reached
its prime ? It is the oldest reflection that has come
down to us. The Historians’ History of the World
quotes from an Egyptian document known as “the
oldest book in the world,” written perhaps 4000 years
8.C., to show that thoughtful Egyptians of that time
regarded civilisation as being past its zenith. They
were tired of the degenerate days in which they lived,
and looked back to the good old days when the
Egyptians, as it seemed to them, were a great people.
Of Egyptian history as a whole—to single out the
most distant from ourselves —the Editor-in-chief of
the History says : —“ When one considers the ancient
resident of the valley of the Nile as a human being,
with desires, emotions, and aspirations almost pre-
cisely like our own ; a man struggling to solve the
same problems of practical Socialism that we are
struggling for to-day—then, and then only, can the
lessons of ancient Egyptian history be brought home
to us in their true meaning and with their true
significance.”
Socialism 800 B.C.
Amongst the earliest traditions in Greek history
are the laws given to Sparta by Lycurgus. Finding a
prodigious inequality in wealth, he had the old
divisions of land cancelled and new ones made, that
all might be equal. To the same end he practically
eliminated the use of money by changing the coinage
from gold and silver to iron, so that a yoke of oxen
was required to remove the equivalent of He
instituted public tables where all ate in common of a
meal determined by statute. Has the most advanced
Socialism ventured further ? The record of the
Greek states is one long commentary upon the
subject of federation ; and its central episode, the
thirty years’ war between Athens (who centralised her
power by accepting her colonial contributions in
money instead of in ships) and Sparta, is the struggle
between the imperial ambitions of a democratic naval
power and the disruptive forces of conservative
particularism. The accumulation of land in the
hands of a few is the central theme of Roman history
from the Carthaginian war to the time of Ciesar—and
similarly through all the ages, and in every country,
the reader sees the same humanity failing or succeed-
ing in the face of problems fundamentally alike, so
that the last event explained in the Historians’
History of the World, the passing of the Surplus
Revenue Act by the Federal Parliament last year,
sounds no very different note from what else the
reader may have seen chronicled in any of the six
thousand years during which the doings of mankind
are traceable.
Ignorance of history is a wilful waste of
experience.
It is not that one can “ look up ” a burning
question in even the fullest and best-arranged library
of history, and settle it as one may the gender of a
Greek noun by reference to the lexicon. The
political value of historical reading is by no means
limited to the discovery of actual parallels, instructive
though they be. But from the reading of history
comes the right attitude, the habit of historical
thinking, which is better than historical information.
A mind thus exercised is not a prey to shibboleths,
is not shaken by every gust that blows. An imagina-
tion fed upon history is filled with ideals that are not
illusions. The eye that has seen into the past can
look beyond the immediate present. To be con-
versant with what has happened in the lives of
nations gives a balance, a mellowness, not to be
derived from the most enlarged personal experience,
and a faith that can see without dismay many suns
go down upon hopes unfulfilled. To this end every
page tells, nor is one passage in the great epic to be
preferred to another. The glory of Venice is not the
less good to know because the readers’ lines are cast
in Coolgardie, nor the quarrel of the investitures the
less true because he puts his trust in neither popes
nor princes.
Germany and “world-histories.”'
The Times takes credit to itself for this, that in
the volumes of the Historians’ History of the World
it has, for the first time in 130 years, rendered pos-
sible for readers of English the entry into this common
heritage of mankind’s experience. This is a self-
conscious age. The future is uneasily canvassed at
every step. The business for each one now is to be
conscious with effect, constructively. It is conscious-
ness rendered effective by culture that has carried
Germany so far in the last half-century, and no one
who knows the country will under-rate the part that
has been played by the diffusion of historical know-
ledge—knowledge not of their own record only, but
of the experience of other nations also. Ever since
Schlosser, in the middle of last century, issued his
“World History for the German People,” the presses
of Germany have sent out a never-ending stream
of universal histories : Ranke, Weber, Rottock,
Bekker, Leo, Weiss, Oncken, one can easily count
eight of conspicuous popularity, many of which have
gone through numerous editions—-Schlosser’s is now
in its 20th (18 volumes).
•
Indeed, culture pays. The British mind the
world over admits the truth with somewhat of an ill
grace ; but history possesses this great recommenda-
tion that it affords such reading as surpasses all other
in interest. The most exclusive lovers of fiction,
once introduced to history of the right kind, must
find their allegiance waver.
A means of forming your own judgment.
A prospectus is necessarily concerned with a
recital of contents and authors, with descriptions of
plan and arrangement. The Times has endeavored
to make the prospectus of the Historians’ History
explicit in all such matters. Nevertheless it believes
that the specimen pages and illustrations included in
the prospectus, and the resume given of each volume,
will enable the reader amply to satisfy himself also as
to the enthralling interest of a history constructed
above all to be readable. This 84-page prospectus is
sent post free for the asking.
A material consideration.
In opening to the English reading public a realm
hitherto closed to all but the student, The Times
does not take credit to itself for offering with one
hand what it withholds with the other. Anyone who
wishes to do so can see the prospectus, and anyone
who has examined the prospectus will be able, should
he wish, to buy the History itself. For the printed
form of subscription sent with the prospectus shows
that the Historians’ History of the World is purchas-
able by a series of monthly payments of only 7s. 6d.,
the first of which secures immediate delivery of the
complete 25 volumes (with an oak bookcase to hold
them, if desire J). And the total price thus paid is.
less than a quarter of the price at which biographies,
travels, and other new books of general interest are
published. The Times intended the price to
register a record, and believes that the History is
indeed the cheapest new book ever published. If
you would be interested, however, to see the pros-
pectus, there is a good reason why you should write
for it at once. The low price and easy terms of pur-
chase apply only to the subscription edition, the sale
of which has already closed in London, and will now
shortly close in Australia also. You should therefore
use the attached form of inquiry at once.
This Inquiry Form, duly filled in, will go for Id. in an open
envelope, and will receive immediate attention at any of the three
offices of The Times [London] in Australia: Sydney, 7 O’Connell
Street; Melbourne, 75 Elizabeth Street; Perth, Forrest Chambers, St .
George's Terrace.
Please send me, post free, 84-page prospectus of
the Historians’ History of the World, with subscription
form showing temporary price and terms of payment.

BRIGHT EYED

AUSTRALIAN GIRLS
Are the Girls who keep their
Blood Rich and Red with
DR. WILLIAMS’ PINK PIKLS
FOR PALE PEOPLE.
Every Australian girl should be bright, active,
cheerful, happy. There is no reason why any
girl shouldn’t be who has enough good red blood
in her veins. She should sleep well, and take the
most out of life. There is not the slightest
shadow of a doubt that girls who don’t enjoy this
good health have the blood to blame. Anasmia is
the enemy of girls and women. A lack of suffici-
ent good red blood causes all those headaches and
sideaches, weakness, paleness and languor. To
become bright, well and happy, the blood supply
must be increasing, and to make new blood there’s
only one thing—Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They
represent the highest achievement in medical
science as a blood restorer and nerve tonic.
Take the case of Miss Mary Blakley, 91 Thomas
Street, Ultimo, Sydney; it’s so like hundreds of
others that scores must saj r , “ That’s just the way
I am.” She stated :—■
“When I was 17 I became anaemic. The mere
smell of food turned me sick. For months Hived
on bread and butter and water, no tea or meat.
I had black circles round my eyes. My face
hadn't a scrap of color in it. You could see
through my ears and hands. I had fainting turns
and my ankles swelled up a lot. I was afraid to
go out for fear a weak turn would take me in the
street. I grew so weak that I could hardly get
about. I had no strength whatever ; even to do my
hair was a trouble. If I tried to go upstairs I
had to rest half way, my heart thumped so that I
thought I was going to die. My people were
terribly worried about me. I had nasty dragging
pains across my back, and was nearly driven mad
with neuralgia. My hands and feet were always
as cold as stones. The doctor said I was on the
point of going into consumption. I took a lot of
medicines but I derived no benefit. Then I read
about Ur. Williams’ Pink Pills and made up my
mind to try them. After the second box I found
my appetite was better, and I began to take a
little interest in things around me. The third
box made my lips quite rosy, and a good color
came into my cheeks. My folks were delighted.
Evert' day saw me steadily improving. By the
time I had finished the fifth box I was quite
changed for the better. I was .able to work about
the house. The sixth box completely cured me.
To look at me now you wouldn’t think that I had
ever been ill.”
While so promptly effective these pills contain
no harmful stimulants or opiates. They are per-
fectly safe and create no drug habit.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are sold by chemists
and storekeepers, or sent by mail, post paid on
receipt of price, 2s. 9d. per box, six boxes 15s. 3d.,

POLITICAL
POINTS
S.A. is getting tired of being regarded
merely aa a wheat-growing State. The great
show of home-made goods lately put up in all the
shops by concerted agreement has set the Chamber
of Manufactures (which is in its 40th year) count-
ing things. It finds 1086 factories, employing
18,408 males and 4227 females. They use in a
year nearly £6,000,000 worth of raw material, pay
£1,750,000 in wages, and have an output of over
£9,000,000. Kather unexpectedly, metal and
machinery works (including those of the Govern-
ment) come out as the class of industry employing
most workmen—nearly 7000.
Sydney City Council, which sees no pros-
pect of converting the Queen Victoria Markets
into anything like a paying asset, has, as a last
hope, urged the Australian Government to
take over the whole thing and make a
general post office of it. Sydney’s G.P.O.
suffers from the same old curse which afflicts the
railway station and other structures—the builders
didn’t look far enough ahead. The only people
who seem to look far enough ahead are those who
build churches. But the idea of a complete new
G.P.O. is a very big order.
Under the N.S.W. Land regulations
administered by the Land Board of 1829 (the
Board consisted of William Stewart, Lieutenant-
Governor ; William Lithgow, auditor; and
Captain Dumaresque, engineer), a special grant
of land was made to every Australian-born woman
on her marriage. The concession ran : “ That to
every Australian-born lady, on her marriage, there
shall be given two square miles of land for farm-
ing purposes.” Few women applied for the land,
and most of those who did apply promptly sold out.
So, after a few years, that plan of settlement was
buried.
Ex-Premier Bent’s Victorian Gold Buyers’
Act, passed at the behest of the Judkinses and
certain mine-owners of the State, actually makes
it impossible for a private individual to buy speci-
mens, for keepsakes or for gifts, without break-
ing the law. Lately, Con Burrow, trustee of the
Balhausen Rifle shield, which the Ballarat team
recently won in competition with the Coldstream
Guards, wished to send to his old regiment, the
Grenadier Guards, a few specimens, but found
that to do so he would either have to buy a gold
mine or go fossicking and find the articles. And
he isn’t in the humor to do either.
Robert Lowe makes Lord Stanley impart
to his secretary in the Colonial Office this piece of
blank-verse description of N.S.W.’s early Parlia-
ment :
You have doubtless heard
That New South Wales has got a Constitution ;
Such .an Assembly as, I should think, never was
Seen since the time of Romulus—all thieves ;
Several who have not yet received their pardons ;
And Stephen says they voted it a breach
Of privilege to pick a member’s pocket
While in debate engaged.
The late Chief Justice Alfred Stephen did, it
appears, indulge his vein of humor to the effect
cited.
“Red Tape Junior ”
The N.S.W. Public Service had its annual conference
while its country cousins were in town. The chief
matter discussed was the right of appeal from the deci-
sions of the Public Service Board other than to the
blessed Board itself. Many of the leading lights of the
conference believe that Section 10 of the Act wasn’t
meant by Parliament to mean that the right of appeal
conferred by the section from the decisions of the Board
was to be only an appeal to the B ard which gave the
decision. It is the general view in the service that no
one in or out of it does really know what Section 10
means, and the P.S. Association is to ask :
(1) Will Wade, as Attorney-General, advise himself, as
Minister in charge of the Board, what Section 10 intends
to say ?
(2) Will he, as Minister in charge, instruct the Board to
be guided by his own advising as Attorney-General ?
(3) Will he, as Minister, take proceedings against him-
self, as Attorney-General, in the law courts to decide the
signification of good old Section 10?
(4) As Premier, will he pass a brand new No. 10?
So we ought to get something settled some way or other.
THE PROPHET.—(MODERN STYLE.)
Mr. James A. Fatten, the American grain speculator,
whp has been forcing up the price of wheat by his opera-
tions on the,Chicago and New York markets, prophesies
that “ before many months the people of Europe will have
to struggle for bread in famine-stricken queues.”—Cable-
gram.
Mr. Patten, who made a profit of nearly £1,000,000 by
his recent operations, is in fear of personal violence, and
has engaged several detectives to protect him.— T’other
Cablegram.
The London Spectator, not talking about
Australia’s Federal capital, but hitting"’ it very
hard by implication:—
Washington was chosen to avoid the jealousy of the
States ; Madrid, for a similar reason, and one might
think that in putting it on an arid plateau its founders
had thrust a pen on to the most central spot on a map of
the country, a,nd said without any further consideration,
“ There shall be the capital.” ... No city can have real
greatness unless it stands on a considerable river.
We learnt at school that Madrid was “o.i the Maii-
zanares,” and the conventional phrase lent, a certain
dignity, to the picture in one’s mind. But the Man-
zahares, when you come to see it in reality, is a wisp of
water trickling among wastes of sand, and husbanded by
washerwomen in the hot months, lest the raw material
of their industry should fail.
In fact, the Manzanares is the Cotter over again.

middle of the Lame Black Patch. is the Federal Cental. Those noble streams, the Cotter and

“ Oby ” writes :
New South Wales wastes a lot of good money over its
Circuit Courts. The ordinary District Courts and one
touring Supreme Court Judge could take up all the cases,
criminal and civil, that now disorganise the Supreme
Court Bench and absorb buckets of public money. Cir-
cuit Court Judges often go to places where no
work awaits them. They take with them Associates,
Crown Prosecutors, and other costly parapher-
nalia. Panels of jurors are also brought together
at mileage rates, and the Judge collects the offering of
white gloves and tells the jurymen that they are not
wanted. Crown Prosecutors who know their way about
and make inquiries have been, known to pocket their 50
guineas fee in Sydney without taking a single step to-
wards the place where they are supposed to prosecute the
prisoner that doesn’t exist. If they added a bill for the
travelling expenses they didn’t incur while going to the
place they didn’t go to, it is believed they would still be
within their rights. A lawyer has so many rights that it
is difficult to know where they begin and where they end.
In Victoria cockying is reckoned to be
less horribly uncertain than in most other parts of
Australia; yet if you cut
the 1908-9 wheat and oat
harvest averages of Vic-
toria in halves, you get
almost exactly tiie Vic-
torian averages for 1907-8.
In one case wheat shows
13T2 bushels ; in the other,
6’55 bushels. And the oat
crop averaged 26’5 bushels
in one year, and 1304
bushels in the other. Yet,
though the cooky never
knows whether he is going
to get 26 bushels, or 13, or
none at all (he didn’t
trouble to harvest his Mal-
lee lands five years ago),
the Foreign-trade crowd
hasn’t even now quite
given up the yarn that
Australia should stick to
the “great natural in-
dustry” of eoekving, and
never mind about the
“ artificial manufacturing
industries.” Neither wheat
nor oats are “natural” to
Australia, in the sense of
being natives of the
country ; but iron is. Still
a small leak like that
doesn’t trouble a Foreign-
trader when he is out on
the argumentative tear.
“ There’s a business-
like Government for you ! ’
said the delighted Fats of
the Commonwealth when
Maoriland’s Joe Ward
weighed out with a Dread-
nought ; “ it docs things.”
it does. For instance, it
did tins the other day
(Government Gazette) :
On and after the first day of February, 1909, the
maximum weight of any sack containing wheat, barley
or oats to be carried by the Railways shall be 2001 b. Any
sack of wheat, barley or oats containing a greater weight
than 2001 b. shall be charged for at four times the ordinary
freight.
It was the sort ot thing that the Australian State
Insects talked about for months and then didn’t
do, because Bat wasn’t willing, and thus they forced
the Commonwealth to try what it could do on its
own account.
There was a pleasant family party at the
Yic. Employers’ Federation the other night,
when Secretary Walpole read a paper on the need
for immigration. Walpole’s views were neither
new nor interesting, hut when he had waded
through his screed Senator Sledger observed that
the. stagnation was due to that party that
wanted to prevent borrowing. Then that relic of
the Victorian Four, F. E. Smith, discovered that
“ Australia was a fine country, but if her people
would not use it, some other people would seize
it ” —which was a nasty jar for the class to which
Smith belongs, the Fat Landlords. After him,
Fairbairn got off the bright remark that “nobody
is allowed to do anything”; and McKet'chup,
the loneliest Tory in the Cabbage Garden, assured
his hearers that what Australia wanted was “the
expenditure of two or three hundred millions in
development.” The report is sawn off here—
probably even the Tories were staggered by the
gorgeousness of McKetchup’s “remedy.”
G-. H. Reid told a Sydney suburban liter-
ary society, the other night, that in his youth he
was ridiculed by older men. But one day, he
said, the worm turned. “And,” he drawled, “it’s
—been—turning—ever—since.” This accounts
for George’s frequent changes of policy, also for
his giddiness.
THE LOGIC OF ANTI-SOSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Government should show that the telephones cost
more than the revenue before asking the people to pay
more.—President Fairbair.v, M.P., at a recent meeting
Victorian Employers' ( A nti-Socialistic) Association.
The advantage t > the people was held to counter-
oalance any loss, and the loss was spread over the
population.— Another Anti-Socialistic speaker at the same
meeting.
Mister Chairman ;—er—ah —when

Which—er—brings me to the subject of discussion, sir.
Regarding telephones:
The Labor party (Groans)
Seems to think it can oppress us with impunity.
But I hold, sir, it is plain
That the benefits we gain

As an Anti-Socialist,
Mister Chairman, I insist —
(If that gentleman who interjected recently
Will endeavor to restrain
His impatience, I’ll explain.
I’d remind him we conduct these meetings decently).
Mister Chairman, to resume.
When I look around this room
On the members of this—er—this great society,

For these benefits, I say
It’s —er—bordering on—um —on impropriety !

CONSTIPATION AND LIVER
COMPLAINT.
A Well-Known Grocer Praises Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills for His Restoration
to Health.
Mr. W. H. Jones, of 19 Rosser Street, Rozelle,
one of Balmain’s oldest residents, tells in liis letter
to the proprietors of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills how this wonderful remedy, by regulating
the bowels and correcting the liver, restored him
to health and strength. With his kind per-
mission we publish his photo., together with his
letter, which is as follows :
“Some few years ago I suffered acutely from
constipation, liver complaint and greatly impaired
Mr. W. H. Jones.
(From a photo.)
health, and my whole sys-
tem became deranged. I
tried many medicines, but
nothing was as good a cor-
rective as Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. They
put my bowels into perfect
working order, overcame
my liver troubles, and my
health became as well as I
could wish it. As a pur-
gative medicine I always
strongly recommend them,
and a dose occasionally
keeps me in the best of
health. I may add that the
most part of my life I have
spent in Balmain, and for 27
years I have kept this shop, and, therefore, I claim
to be one of the oldest residents of Rozelle, and
am, consequently, well known.”
Only about one manor woman in a hundred is per-
fectly healthy. The other 99 have some digestive
trouble, and perhaps more than 50 per cent, of
these could trace their trouble to that most pre-
valent evil—constipation. It’s a simple thing of
itself, but, like many simple things, it may grow
and become complicated. Constipation is the
root of nine-tenths of the sickness of man, and a
large proportion of the sickness of women. Nature
often requires a little assistance, and if this assist-
ance is given at the first indication much distress
and suffering may be averted.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Sydney Metropolitan Rugby Union started its
competition on Saturday, and some thousands rolled up
to see the first bloodshed. They went away disappointed.
Not a man was killed or even biffed. Play was humorous,
for most of the teams showed a hideous lack of condition,
and a Rugby team - out of form is a clownish thing. At
Hampden Oval Sydney met North Sydney, and fell upon it.
The hillmen from over the water were soft as butter, and
the Sydney crowd were at least as hard as cheese ; and
the spectacle was a sorrowful one for the Northern bar-
rackers. The men onlookers from the North swore and
some of the girls wept bitterly. Other girls, dazed at the
turn of events, proposed “police interference” while
gazing with dry, anguished eyes. When it was o>er
Sydney had scored 26 points to three.
The surprise of the day was the sudden collapse
of the Eastern Suburbs men, who were contending with
Glebe. At the start, the Easterns had a stiff wind right
in their teeth, but playing up in an amazing' fashion,
they more than held their own. With a pack that wolfed
the leather and a back division that seemed as sharp as
needles, they hemmed the Glebe crowd round the goal
and then stormed the line. Right through the half
Glebe was penned up in its own territory, breaking out
spasmodically only to be hurled back. Iri one of these
sudden charges Glebe scored, and the wind carrying the
ball between the posts, made the records five all. Eastern
Suburbs having held its own so easily with the wind
against it, felt confident when the gale was behind it.
But the stress of that first half had been too fierce.
Quite suddenly the condition of the team gave out, like
that of the one-horse shay ; and over the remnants Glebe
stalked to victory; winning by 24 points to five. An
amazing collapse.
For the rest, Newtown and Manly played a
draw with three points each ; and the fact that Manly
can face a team like Newtown on level term indicates
that this season will see fulfilled the prophecy of The
Bulletin that it was merely a question of time till the
surf-bathing town took its place among the front-rankers
of the Union. The way the Villagers fought their uphill
fight during the season when they were down under
showed the team to be composed of the right stuff.
South Sydney and University did some very level peg-
ging, which resulted in favor of South by 11 to eight. But
the defeat of St. George by Western Suburbs was a pitiful
business. West let loose charge after charge that swept
through St. George like fire through tussock, and the
hand on the scoring board showed 20 to three.
• * • *
The League had eight teams in the field, and,
take it all round, its matches showed closer finishes than
those of the Union. The only walk-over was that of
Eastern Suburbs when it stepped on the corpse of Glebe.
It was a cake-walk in which the East scored 38 points
to Glebe’s five. This was fairly decisive, even for
Northern Union rules. Western Suburbs also downed
Newtown by 10 points to three ; while South Sydney,
escaping defeat by the skin of its teeth on a dozen
occasions, managed to win out by four points to nil.
Never did a team so often get to the point of all but
scoring as Balmain. Newcastle had a joyous trip, and
broke up North Sydney by 13 points to seven. All the
real excitement was at the League matches, where the
casualties were one broken leg and a solitary fractured
nose.
* * * *
In the Sydney Soccer competition for the Raw-
son Gup, in which a level dozen teams are competing,
Rozelle and Pvrmont, each with two wins, head the list
with four competition points each. Sydney and Glebe
make the second line with three each ; Garden Island,
Ultimo, and Balmain, have a pair ; while Newtown, the
Powerful, and Granville have one. Northern and Western
Suburbs have so far failed to score even a draw, and are
still commencing life with absolutely nothing.
The fact that Garden Island and the Powerful
have each a team in the field puzzles some people.
But the explanation is simple. Garden Island does not in-
clude sailors or marines. It is a club strictly reserved to
artificers, engineers, and such like aristocrats who would
not be seen dead in company with a blue jacket. This,
in the community’s present state of mind, strikes one as
humorous. But, of course, there are good reasons for
the position from a football point of view. The ships are
often away, and to rely upon the crack sailors would be a
blunder. So the permanent hands at the Isle have their
own club.
* a * *
Appearances point not only to huge attend-
ances at Melbourne football matches this season, which
begins next Saturday, but also to an extra-fierce bogging-
in of the various League and Association players, and to
a reckless but sub rosa splashing round of capital. Of
the 10 League clubs, eight have scoured the Common-
wealth for new talent, men from Maoriland, N.S.W.,
Queensland, Westralia. and S.A. having been tried in the
practice matches. Carlton has sampled no less than 13
possible recruits, Essendon 18, St. Kilda 22, Collingwood
10, South Melbourne 12, Fitzroy 20, Richmond 28, and
Melbourne 15. Geelong has tested but six from
outside its own district, and ’Varsity, though it
has the whole Commonwealth to choose from, is
in effect a strictly “district” club, in that its
players are chosen from past and present students
only. The committee that manages the Carlton
Ground at Prince’s Park, and the Collingwood Council
which bosses Victoria Park, have put up gorgeous new
stands—which the takings are presently expected to pay
(or—and already the jingle of coin can be heard as the
heavy turnstiles swing. Collingwood’s city fathers, with
a nice concern for possibilities, have struck the brilliant
idea of constructing a subway with separate entrances for
each team, direct from the playing area to the ’bailers’
dressing-rooms, so that the ill-regulated bloke with the
handy paling and the hysterical Lizzie with the vicious
hatpin may be baulked of their prey. Also, the
umpire will escape assault and battery—unless the
Lizzies aforesaid swarm over the fence, and “ get
to ” him on the field of battle itself. The
said umpire also seems eager to qualify for the
stoush and the two guineas that mostly represent his
day’s pay—no less than 213 of him having applied to the
League for appointment, and 200 to the Association. The
majority want to be field umpires. The boundary and
goal umpires come in for more damage and less pay. The
Association clubs have acquired a number of League
rejects and many promising juniors. The latter circum-
stance has caused strained relations among the junior
bodies, which naturally, but unsuccessfully, object to their
best players being enticed away. Besides these numerous
organisations the resuscitated Vic. Rugby Union will hav e
six clubs mauling each other for a trophy, and the Socce r
enthusiasts are preparing a small fray among themselves-
Certainly, Melbourne won’t go short of toeballthis season,
though the lack of enclosed grounds will compel all but
the 20 League and Association clubs to be strict amateurs.
Which is good for the morals if bad for the pocket.
* « * *■
The remnants of the N.S.W. Rugby League
team scrambled back on to Australian soil last week with a
feeling of thankfulness. But for the charity of the
Northern Union the blessed team would have been
stranded in the Cold Land, owing to the paucity of gate
money. Several members of the team stayed on with
English county clubs at fair salaries, and they are the
only ones who did any good out of the tour. The
Rugby Union treasurer is also wearing sackcloth
and ashes,. for the tramp abroad of the Wallabies
has resulted in a loss of £1392 13s. 4d. Paucity
of gate money is again the trouble; but still,
there might have been enough to go round if the team
hadn’t indulged in such Babylonian luxury. First-class
travelling on all the railways, the best hotels, and the
finest and oldest of liquors are said to have been the order
of the day, and the prettiest of masseuses were employed
to remove the battle stains. The All Blacks brought back
a profit of £9500 a couple of years ago ; but the Wallabies
only raked in £7787 16s. 7d. altogether. The simultaneous
appearance of two Australian teams is blamed for the
disaster, bub that is probably bunkum. England is pass-
ing through an awful slump, and thousands of people who,
two years ago, had money to splash on football, to-day
haven’t got it to spend on food. Anyhow, there will be no
more English fifteens for some little time to come.
* * * *
N.S.W. Rugby Union showed signs of being
leniently inclined when it came to dealing with the cases
of T. Griffin and A. B. Burge, who were ordered off and
suspended in England. In the case of Griffin, it was
decided that the Glebe player had been sufficiently pun-
ished, and the whitewash was administered right away.
Burge was not so lucky, but the council decided to ten-
tatively remove the suspension, so that Burge can play
for South Sydney while the English Union is forwarding
further particulars. So presumably Burge is as good as
out of the wood.
* * * •
Messrs. Beeby and Moffat, the honorary solici-
tors to the N.S.W. Rugby League, having given an
opinion that Messrs. Giltinan, Trumper, and Hoyle were
acting as agents and trustees of the Rugby League in
their transactions with various ground proprietors and
others, and that their contention that they were acting
personally is leaky, those gentlemen are to be called upon
to furnish accounts. The League formally adopted the
advice, and issued orders that Messrs. Giltinan, Trumper
and Hoyle be promptly called upon to furnish such
accounts. This is generally regarded as being the signal
for the band to play.
• * * »
As champion, with the right of choosing the
water, Dick Arnst has decided that the Wanganui River
(M.L.) shall be the scene of the race with Webb, and he
will begin his preparation right away. In spite of the
crushing defeat he experienced, Webb has a numerous
following, which, strange to say, is prepared to splash its
money readily. Father Tuck is again the Wanganui
blacksmith’s chief backer, and the fact that the party is
willing to risk another £5OO suggests that it is satisfied
that in the former race Webb was not at his best.
Brother Jack will train the champion, and it is said that
Peter Neilson, who trained Arnst for the former race, has
been offered the job of getting Webb into shape. As he
has not heard from Arnst, it is more than likely the offer
will be accepted.
* * * *
Still they come : Hagney, the mighty cyclist,
spends his days struggling to discover the art of balancing
an outrigger down Middle Harbor way (Sydney); and
now Tom Larcombe, the champion road-racing cyclist,
has also taken to the water. Peter Neilson, who coached
Dick Arnst, will be his mentor.
* * * *
Big Jack Arnqt, the M.L. cyclist, got a large
share of limelight on April 14. At 5 a.ni. he left Christ-
church (M.L.) in hurried pursuit of the Christchurch-
Dunedin bike record. It then stood to the credit of
A. Humm, another prominent M.L. bikist, who some
weeks ago covered the 245 miles between the towns in
the remarkable time of 14hrs. lmin. This was considered
by some experts to be a superhuman performance, but
Jack Arnst didn’t think so. Paced by two motor bicycles
and attended by a car and attendants, Arnst covered the
old M.L. Dunlop Road Race course to Timaru in shrs.
llmin., which was 44min. better than Humm’s time.
Filled with hope and a large quantity of food supplied
from the car, he fled south, breaking all the between-
towns records as he went. At Palmerston (205 miles) he
was over an hour and a half inside the previous best
figures. Then he struck the hills that surround
Dunedin. One motor bike refused to go on with the job,
and the other could not travel fast enough for Jack, who
was hungry for work and bursting to get to the end of it.
The motor car, however, was equal to the strain, and
stuck to him. Three punctures came along, and delayed
the anxious cyclist for twenty minutes. But he mended
his tyres and rushed onward, reaching the Scotch
metropolis at 5.21 p.m. He had covered the distance in
the marvellous time of 12hrs. 21min., and clipped
lhr. 40min. from the previous best. Until a fortnight
ago, the snail train took 9hrs. Bmin. to do the same
distance ! Arnst broke twelve records during his ride-
in fact he broke everything except his neck.

The outcome of the Dunlop Military Despatch
ride from Adelaide to Sydney is that a certain number of
cyclists will be trained in each company of the Defence
forces for scouting and despatch work. The Minister for
War and the Military Board were much impressed with
the enthusiasm shown, and regard the mass of energy
and fervor represented by the aggregate cyclist through-
out the continent as too valuable an asset to be allowed
to run to waste. Meanwhile the Board is considering
how best to turn it to account.

Sydney Cricket Ground Trust is standing on
the verge of the biggest fall-in in its history. Both the
Rugby Union and the Cricket Association are kicking
against its scale of charges, and the 0. G. Trust shows a
disposition to prove the possession of a backbone. It ap-
parently has doubts about the earnestness of the Rugby
Union kick ; and is darkly suspected of being able to
exert a pull in the councils of that organisation. But the
Cricket Association is in very deadly earnest, and unless
the Ground Trust makes some concession, the chances
are that there will be no more cricket there for five years at
the least, and possibly for 10 years. The Association has
called for tenders from the controlling bodies of the
various public grounds in and around Sydney ; and it
is probable that the best offer will be accepted for five
years, with the right of renewal for another five. The
Ground asks for 10 per cent, of the gross takings, and
the Cricket Association retorts that, with about 3000
male ticket-holders and God knows how many female
ones doing the deadhead racket, it would lose money even
if it got the ground for nothing, as the Melbourne Asso-
ciation does.
The Bulletin would like to draw the Associa-
tion’s attention to Wentworth Park, which has been
improved enormously of late years. It is an ideal ground
from many points of view, and, with a little expenditure,
could be made first-class in the way of accommodation.
It is well served by trams, and the extra lines necessary
for the increased traffic could be laid down quickly. It
is in the centre of a big population, which under no cir-
cumstances would go to the Cricket Ground, for that
place, when you come to consider it, is right on the border
of nowhere. Quite recently the Cricket Ground Trust
donated £5OO to the Cricket Association. In the event of
the Ground refusing to come to reasonable terms,
the Association should loan the Wentworth Park people
that same £5OO with which to construct a home for
first-class cricket, at present being driven out of doors
by its grasping stepmother, the Sydney Cricket Ground
Trust. There is no reason why the Association should
have any compunction about using the £5OO donated by
the Trust to provide another ground. The money was
donated to foster cricket, and by releasing cricket from
the tentacles of the Ground octopus, the money will be
really spent to foster cricket. Again, considering the
wav the Ground has bled the Association in the past, the
“ donation ” was not really a donation, but merely a i
partial restitution. *
N.S.W. Cricket Association is firmly on its feet,
and finishes the season with a credit balance of £1336.

Club cricket in Adelaide, coming to a tardy
close, shows the batting list headed by Claxton, Caust,
Dolling, Hack, Pellew, Leak and Mayne (Gehrs was 24th,
and Clem Hill hardlv played at all). The top seven all
averaged over 50 (Claxton was 68). Biggest aggregate
was Dolling’s, the highest score Pellew’s 215 (but “ Solly ”
Hill, Clem's little brother, made 211 not out). In bowling
the leaders were Pretty, VVhitty, Reedman, Webb,
Coombe, Wright and Travers. O’Connor, who only rises
to big occasions, and has by’ the terms of his engagement
to play for the weakest club on the list, comes 34th.
Travers took most wickets, as he did continuously in the
seasons from 1900 to 1905. In fact, the one striking
feature of the season (except that S.A. won two Shield
matches, instead of its usually invariable single win) is the
success in Saturday games of Travers, Reedman, Hack
and Leak —all veterans who had been dropped from the
State XI.
* * * *
The appearance of automobile corps at the
Easter manoeuvres in N.S.W. and Victoria recalls the fact
that the German Government is just now building some
hundreds of armored automobiles for field work. One
Sydney newspaper expresses the opinion that autocars
will not be of much use in actual fighting, but this writer
begs to differ. The cars that the Germans are building
are bullet-proof as far as rifle fire is concerned, and are
made to accommodate each 40 men besides carrying quick-
firing artillery. For raiding purposes these cays will be
invaluable, and in attacking' positions will no doubt play
a prominent part. In armored motors it will be possible
to rush a small army of men across a fire-swept zone in
a very short space of time ; and the moral effect on
a force which is charged by a squadron of these
vehicles loaded up with rifles and machine artillery
worked by men behind armor will be fairly disastrous.
Properly handled the idea would enable a small attacking
force on anything like smooth ground, where there had
been no time to erect defences, to get to close quarters
and deal out fire at its own discretion till artillery
arrived. And, anyhow, at close quarters the rifle always
dominates the cannon ; so probably armored motor cars
would prove useful even for attacking artillery. The
trouble is that at present the cars that are being operated
in conjunction with our defence training are not military
cars, but costly and luxurious vehicles built only for
touring.

Amateur athleticism in Maoriland has
brightened. The newly-patched-together agreement
among five centres contained a provision that the
old M.L. Amateur Athletic Association must burst up
and cease to be; and the heads of the old body have
therefore thrown in their boots for the feet of the new
body to wear. There is more harmony in the new Associ-
ation than in the old—so far, at any rate.
* * * *
The hypocrisy of the N.S.W. Girls’Swimming
Association, which recently ukased that one of its cham-
pions must not have her photo, published in a paper, was
again displayed in respect to the public schools’ girls’
carnival. This event was attended by at least a dozen
male persons, in defiance of the Association’s rule. If
the Association had the courage of its protests, it would
hasten to disqualify each of the 700 girls who took part
in that carnival; but obviously it is a flabby concern,
and is afraid to tackleanything with the power of clawing
back. The girls who attend private schools are also
under the ban, for their carnival was carried out under
the direction of male officials. Consequently, if the
Association dared to be honest, it would disqualify every
girl of any aquatic ability at present attending school in
Sydney. This, however, would leave very few to carry
out the future programmes of the alleged Association, so
it thinks it best, like the crook policeman, not to see too
much. But the solitary girl in bathing costume, whose
photo, seemed likely to’ go into, the papers, was only one
girl, and the Association’s valiant attitude towards one
girl is very valiant indeed.

T. R. Allt, who died a while ago, left behind
ten shares in the North Coast S.N. Co. for the Balmain

struggle promises to be mighty.

As might have been expected, Tahmmy Burns is
breaking out in a fresh place shorty, if he has
not already done so. He is going to teach the
Australian the theory and practice of baseball
as it is balled in Amurka. Tahmmy was a mighty
’bailer before the Lord in the days when he had
not attained to the rank of a first-grade pug, but all the
same there are nasty Australian ’bailers who prophesy
that he will yet start out to instruct his grandmother in
the scientific method of extracting albumen from the ova
of the phasianus.

Among the contestants at the recent Wonder-
land (Melbourne) tournament was a half-caste Chinese
youth, who got as far as the semi-final and was very close
up to the lad who outpointed him. Though in one of
the lighter divisions, the Chow pug was a splendidly-
built fellow, and knew more of the game than
most of the competitors. So far, Chows haven’t shown
up much in the ring. A few years back Mick Nathan, of
Melbourne, put up, in the weird amphitheatre attached
to his British Lion Hotel in Lilly Buck-stleet, a scrap for
the alleged championship of the Chinese quarter; but
the Mongols who took part made it a sort of cat-scramble
before the end of the first round. A year or two later
San Francisco talked of the great things that were
expected from one Ah Wing ; but the first genuine white
pug who came into contact with him made him feel like a
Korean under Japanese protection. The Jap. pug hasn’t
appeared as yet, and it’s a matter for congratulation that
he never will be in the heavyweight division.
The latest inquirer after Johnson is Marvin
Hart,- the lengthy Yankee who walloped him on points at
their last meeting, and whom he side-tracked at Phila-
delphia some 18 months ago. Hart seems really anxious,
and is blowing off steam in the most approved Yankee
style bv declaring that he will just die of disappointment
if he can’t “get” Johnson for a bout of anything up to
100 rounds.
* * * *
That the Yankee is no sport is evidenced by the
way he goes about arranging his fights. A scrap in the
Sta'tes is 99 per cent, chin-wagging and coarse personal
abuse, and one per cent, scuffling in a ring. The usual
procedure is for some scrapper to announce that he is
just dying to fight someone else for love, honor, glory,
and anything up to a million dollars. The other
fellow, after listening disdainfully for a while, opens
his head to remark that when the “ ham ” that has
just spoken has proved his right to a fight he can have
it, for anything up to five million dollars. Also he can
have it for anything from one round to 1000 ; likewise he
can have it in a 10ft. ring after throwing the key away.
In addition to which, he will receive such a trouncing
that in the third round he will jump through the ropes.
Back whizzes the reply that the skiter who has talked so
big has failed to put up his splosh ; and that his mother
was a lady who indulged in habits peculiar to Thibetan
women of fortune ; and when the speaker gets to him he
will curse the day he was foaled. In the next stage the
interchanges of compliments becomes unprintable. Then
the fight. The last scene of all is the flourish of the
sporting papers, which have discovered indisputable evi-
dence that the fight was a fake and a pre-arranged affair
from start to finish.
* * * *
Choice sample of Yankee fight talk :
“ Me and me wife can lick a smokehouse full of hams
like Jim Jeffries ! "Stonewall Jackson Butt, colored,
fighter.
“Jim can do just what he thinks about fighting John-
son. I will not try to influence him either way. It’s up
to Jim. If he wants to sail into Johnson and beat the
life out of him, I want him to.”—Mrs. Janies Jeffries, in
a recent interview.
We have seen it in the Jingo dailies, time and
again, that the Yankee is our natural ally, and that in
the Empire’s day of distress the White Fleet will come
to the rescue of the reeling Titan in the North Sea. We
have been exhorted to look up to the Yank as a brother
and a last refuge, because blood is thicker than water ;
and slush will tell. But the Yank is no sport. After re-
ceiving our moral assistance in the war with Spain, and
being helped by the British with coaling facilities to take
the Philippines, and after having assured Bull that nothing
would be done to damage Bull’s trade in the islands, Bull
awoke the other day to find that the door of the Islands
had been slammed in his face. That was bad enough.
But this week a worse outrage comes to light.
All former iniquities are mere pin pricks compared to
this latest indignity put up by the Yankee. Our one
world-championship scrap is being filched from us. We
put up £6OOO for the Yankee Burns and £l5OO for the
other Yankee Johnson. We did them both proud, and
allowed Johnson to pose as a scientist, and to make re-
marks about Reid, Deakin and Bruce Smith. And now
the swindling humbugs are moving to ignore our cham-
pionship scrap by declaring that James Jeffries is still
boss fighter of the world, and that he has been challenged
by Al. Kauffman who will, if he wins, claim the globe’s
championship and draw the color line against Johnson.
He has deposited $lOOO with the challenge, so he means
business. Now, honestly, what use have we for these
Yankees after that? These ruffians who seek to deprive
us of our one little ewe lamb world-championship scrap.
No, the Yank is no sport.
* * * *
New Yorkers are resorting to elaborate dodges
to get round the law prohibiting prize fights ; and the
latest idea is the athletic club device. To become a
member of the club one has to pay an entrance fee and
be balloted for after the most careful inquiries have been
made by the officers of the club. When a scrap is on the
fighters are engaged as “ entertainers,” and paid as such.
There is no referee and no decisions are given, and
spectators decide to their own satisfaction who is winner.
Some of the salaries paid to entertainers are enormous.
To view the fight the member has first to produce his card
of membership, on the back of which is a solemn and
legal agreement not to transfer the pasteboard. Having
gained admission to the building, another fee has to be paid
to retain a seat in the club’s theatre where the “enter-
tainment” is in full blast. So far this dodge has mostly
prevented the police gaining admission, as all their
attempts to effect membership have been blackballed ;
but even where they' did gain admission by some ruse they
have heen powerless to interfere, as they have been un-
able to prove that the scrap was for a prize. Boxing
displays by hired entertainers are legal. But how willing
some of those boxing displays are ! It doesn’t strike this
writer as being a very new or original device.
* • * *
The lack of sportsmanship in the Yankee
character is appalling. For years the America Cup has
been kept in the States by the regulations and not by the
yachts. When a foreigner wrestles with a Yankee on
Yankee soil, the Yankee is allowed to indulge in eye-
gouging, nostril-bursting, and toe-breaking. No foreigner
dreams of fighting a Yankee at home for a championship
—it’s mere foolishness. And for years the horse-jumping
record of the world was kept in the U.S.A. by the simple
expedient of jumping the animals off springboards that
had been turfed over, and omitting to mention the fact
in the records of the jumps. At the Olympian games the
Yankees swindled and bustled hideously, and made them-
selves detested throughout Europe by their unfair tactics.
* * * *
The boxing world is perturbed in its soul on
the question of weights. It is widely felt that there
should be more grades to ensure more equal battles and
avoid the unpleasant spectacle of a little fellow like
Burns combating a towering mass of meat like Johnson.
As far as can be ascertained, the present weights are :
Bantam, up to 1181 b.
Feather-weight ~ 1261 b.
Light-weight 1281 b. to 1381 b.
Welter-weight 1381 b. ~ 1441 b.
Middle-weight 1441 b. ~ 1581 b.
Heavy-weight, anything over 1581 b.
The whole idea of dividing fighters into separate classes
on weights is to ensure equal contests, and it is argued
that there are so many men making their living by this
form of “industry” now that some more subdivisions are
required to ensure fair mills. So the following list is pro-
posed in Britain and Amurka, the real homes of the
game:—
Bantam-weights, up to 1161 b.
Light Feathers ~ 1221 b.
Feather-weights ~ 1261 b.
Light-weights ~ 1331 b.
Welter-weights ~ 1451 b.
Middle-weights ~ 1581 b.
Light Heavy-weight ~ 1751 b.
Heavy-weight, all over 1751 b.
If this classification comes off, Tahmmy will probably re-
enter the ring, and once more become a world-champion
while the days of his youth run swiftly away.
Sydney Grammar School continues to pickup
championships. Recently it gathered in the top honors
at cricket; and last week, by its defeat of three other
colleges, the Great Public Schools rowing championship
and the Major Rennie Trophy also went its way.

| A letter from “ Kay Ell ”:
How is it that the nastiest and most unfair things
said about England and the English are said by the
most bigoted Imperialists ? Only a few months have
passed since Manager Teeee, of the A.M.P., made remarks
about the English people which, had they been made by a
supporter of Australian national sentiments, would have
been execrated in every right-thinking assemblage as
rank disloyalty and “ Dingoism.” Now Colonel Burns
comes along with the bizarre assertion that one out of
every four Englishmen is a degenerate. If Burns’story
were correct, the sooner the Germans or somebody else
came along and annihilated the whole English nation the
better for the world. A country, even if it be an
island, containing ten millions of degenerates is nothing
less than a menace to all humanity, and, from a race
standpoint, it would be worth while slaughtering the
thirty millions of normal beings to stamp out such a
plague-spot. But, fortunately for the world generally,
anybody who has visited England knows that the Burns’
tale is so much flapdoodle; unless he accepts the rigid
definition of a degenerate which includes every man who
wears spectacles or who is bald at 40. Probably 99 per
cent, of the human race is degenerate in the physical
sense, if compared with its ancestors of the cave era—
assuming that our bone-seekers haven’t mistaken the
mammoth and the extra special gorilla for ancestors—
but the ordinary acceptation of the term does not class
the two Burnses—Tommy and the Colonel—as de-
generates. It regards as normal all men but those with a
mental or moral or physical kink, and that a kink of
larsrer dimensions than is indicated bv merely playing
golf or wearing weird whiskers or haviiig slightly handy
legs or impeaching a whole nation in an off-hand way on
insufficient grounds.
“ Bayonet ” writes regretfully :
I wish this universal training idea had been in force
when I started work, some 13 years ago. The first billet
I ever had was in a drapery establishment, where annual
holidays were not fashionable. I worked there for eight
weary years, and during all that time I neyer had more
than four days’ spell at one stretch. Occasionally a wild
longing to get out and away would come over me. I
didn’t want, either to rest or loaf. I would have been
more than content to sleep under canvas and to drill all
day. It would have been a holiday to me—a whole fort-
night or three weeks of sunlight and open air, away from
the idiotic worry and rush of a badly-run establishment,
where rats were always dying under the stairs, and the
boss’s temper depended on how much of the trading
capital he had lost at the races. (He was a rotten judge
of “form” in horseflesh; consequently his temper was
almost invariably the same.) If Australia had had the
boon of compulsory military training in those days, I
would have been forced— forced, mind you—to take every
year a splendid holiday away from the‘absurdities of that
excited establishment. I am sorry for Australia’s sake
that we did not have compulsory training 13 years ago,
for by now we would have had one of the best citizen
armies on earth ; but I am sorrier still for those lost lti
or 24 weeks of healthy camp-life that will never now lie
mine this side of Jordan.

fill the home with sunshine. When they become fretful
and out of sorts, it is generally because a mild laxative
is required —not a purgative, mind ! Nothing is so truly
beneficial in such cases as a dose of California Syrup of

corrects gently, naturally, comfortingly, overcoming the

“P. Richard”: I believe it would pay anyone to
hawk round copper in the shape of penny-pieces
in certain “working-class” suburbs of Melbourne,
where the penny-in-the-slot system for the supply of gas
is a household institution. Owners of “slots” would
readily pay 3s. 3d. in silver for dozen actual
coppers, such is the scarcity. Realise that a collector
averages from 15s. to 20s. at each house, and multiply
this by many dozens of houses,-and some idea can
be gained of the lock-up of coppers. In some
suburbs it is hardly safe for a man to go about if he is
known to have pennies on him. I was lately' in a sub-
urban bank on a Saturday morning, and I must have
struck it at the busiest hour, for the counter
was packed. I thought I had drifted into a penny'
savings bank when I heard the pressing and
repeated demands for “copper without half-pennies.”
I really expected to see the teller hea?e an ink-
stand at one or other of the applicants. The latter I
judged to be shopkeepers, who wanted the coins for their
own smaller fr.v of customers. “ I haven’t got any—l’m
cleared out,” .the teller exclaimed at last, in sheer and
final desperation. So I’m going to give the dodge a
trial, at any rate—that is, the hawking round of, say, £.5
of coppers (pennies, of course) as a first experiment,'ask-
ing one penn.v commission on every dozen. If the game
succeeds, I will order two tons of'coppers from adjacent
States, and take them round in a van.
* * * *
Those German manufacturers of razors worth
about Is. each, but put up in eases marked “ Price
10s. 6d.,” are evidently trying a new trick ; for the Cus-
toms have got hold of a consignment stamped, “Price
lj dollars.” .They were invoiced at the same old price as
tne 10s. fid. frauds, viz., 7s. per dozen (that is, sevenpence
each). Apparently the Commerce Act isn’t designed to
block this caper; though in a country' where commer-
cialism and honesty,were synonymous, the Police Offences
Act would meet the case.
* * * *
“Dandalup”: Westralia has a bundle of in-
dustries waiting to be developed on big lines. First-class
sponges—some of them much superior to the average
imported article—can be got almost anywhere along the
coast. A fine collection was recently presented to
Prime Minister Andy Fisher upon his visit to the West.
Cotton-growing is another industry that would flourish
with a little assistance. I have seen cotton plants, grow-
ing almost wild and blooming profusely, as far south as
Champion Ba.v. Over ,30. years ago a relative of mine
secured a diploma and bronze medal at the Melbourne
Exhibition for cotton grown in this district. A consign-
ment was sent to London, and realised top prices.
Tobacco also flourishes in the Western State’s sub-
tropical regions. Whaling, which some y'ears ago
threatened to be a sizeable business, has died an unnatural
death, although the coast waters, especially north of
Geraldton, teem with large mobs of whales at certain
periods of the,year. Only recently I counted over 40 near
Cape Inscription, during one day’s sail. Further north,
banana, date, cocoanut, rubber, pineapple, castor oil,
rice, tobacco, arrowroot, and half a dozen other sorts of
plantations will thrive under the white man’s care and
management; while some parts will grow ihe finest pota-
toes that ever wore a jacket. North and N. W. Australia
should be able to supply' all Asia with “Murphies” of
the finest quality if it had the population to grow them.
Yet we have in Australia politicians who tell us: (1)
That the white man can’t live in these parts ; (2) that, if
he can live there, he can’twork there ; and (3) that, if he

“Bon” : I wandered into a second-hand book
store lately', to discover that it takes all brands of books
to build a library, and all manner of men to sell them.
Questioned the proprietor re sundry more or less out-of-
date works, and wound up with a query' as to bis posses-
sion of an unexpurgated copy of Rabelais. The book-fiend
thought hard, then reluctantly confessed his inability
to oblige. Thought harder, and then queried : “ What
was he, anyhow—historian?” “Yes, some —likewise
humorist.” The bookman brightened up immensely,
and, diving into the depths of a huge box, emerged with
triumph writ large all over him. “ Why didn’t you say
so? Now, if you want something comic, this ain’t too
bad : ‘ Eliza’s Husband,’ by Barry Pain.” I advised him
to pet trampled on by a taxi-cab, whereon he called me a
“ bloke.”
THAT DREADNOUGHT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Slump !
Sudden slump !
Hear the Jingoes rave and jump—
All in vain the gush and blather of the Daily Pharisee :
Vain the howling of the Press—all is dust and emptiness,
And the grief of old Mayor Smiffkins is a sight that
gladdens Me ;
Mister Smiffkins, feeling ill, weepeth sadly in the till—
He whoyester-week was bawling for the Teuton’s distant
blood ; •
Mister Smiffkins isn’t well, so he furls his crimson yell—
Yea, the craze has fizzled, and its name is
simply Mud.
Slump !
Abject slump !
Wade and Co. have got the hump—
They are cursing Andrew Fisher; hear them howl and
wail and roar.
They had pointed out the way with a loud and joyous
bray—
Yea, the path that leadeth Pawnward to St. Cohen’s dis-
t int door !
But alas for Mister Wade and the blither-struck brigade—
Andrew Fisher would not hearken to the shriek for sudden
loans ;
He was obdurate and grim, hence the clods they heave
at him—
Hence the cursing and the raving, hence the bitter sobs
and groans!
Slump !
P'earful slump !
Stick their heads beneath the pump —
Wash away the gas and frenzy and the tendency to yell ;
For the story of the cow wraps the Dreadnought madness
now,
And the maffiik hath dsparte 1 from the leading article !
To the level of the drunk hath the fool proposal sunk—
Yea, no more the words of S.niffiains are proclaimed for
men to see ;
Gone the glory and the gush, ceased the streams of
“ loyal ” slush—
Yea, the sacred name of Smiffkins sinks in sad obscurity !
Slump !
Total slump !
Who the Devil cares a dump?—
Let us build a fighting navy for our own Australian land !
Uncle Bull is far away—lest the Ape this land should
sway,
Let us launch the ships of battle with a strong, deter-
mined hand 1
While the Smiffkins people moan, while the Wades and
Murrays groan,
Let Australia’s dockyards thunder with a large, incessant
roar ;
Ere the Monkey starts to jump—lest Australia’s star
should slump —
Let our forges flame to Heaven building armaments of
war !
VICTORIA.
GRANT HERVEY.

IN BANANA LAND.
Arthur Morgan, who was the first Queens-
land Premier who had the courage to attack in
real earnest the disastrous work of the Continuous
Government, is now Lieut.-Governor. He has
been Speaker, Premier, President of the Legisla-
tive Council, Lieutenant-Governor, and now
Deputy Figurehead, all inside six years. Morgan’s
father fought the squattocracy of Queensland with
a pen dipped in gall. And it was a battle in those
bad old days, when the great estates were being
amassed, when the small settler was hunted as if
he was an interloper or a rabbit, and when the
Big Landlord declared that the Darling Downs
couldn’t grow a cabbage. Arthur Morgan inherited
the fighting instinct, though he had seen his
father ruined financially as a newspaper pro-
prietor by the hatred and the malice of the
squatters. With Kidston as Treasurer, he un-
furled the no-borrowing flag (lately taken down),
preached and practised the gospel that Queensland
must pay its way, and passed many-measures which
the Philp crew declared would ruin the State. It
was an unfortunate day for Queensland when
Arthur Morgan was tempted to throw up the
Premiership for a dull, foolish job in the Museum
of Fossils.
HEMORRHOIDS.
You should be a dynamo of energy. Are you?
Probably some secret pain is sapping your vitality,
making work difficult. Thousands of sufferers from
hemorrhoids fail to realise that their ailment is
solely due to impaired digestion, that a strength-
ening of their stomach, a stimulating of the liver,
a cleaning out of the toxins that infest the intes-
tines, is all that stands between them and per-
fect health. FRANZ JOSEF Natural Aperient
Water is Nature’s remedy for hemorrhoids and all
diseases of the intestinal tract. Taken regularly
in mild doses, it works wonders. Begin to use it
at once, and see how quickly this trouble will dis-
appear. Franz Josef Springs, Budapest, Hungary.
Died in Brisbane on April 15, aged 66,
W. C. Brown, who discovered gold at Croydon,
now nearly defunct, and named the townshipafter
his birthplace -just outside London. When he
made the discovery he was engaged in squatting,
but he ceased to squat on the strength of his find.
Now a whole lot of Croydon people would be glad
to squat if they had anything better than their
debts to squat upon.
The judicial mantle of recently-retired
Judge Noel has fallen upon an unassuming person
in Townsville, by name A. W. Macnaughton. As
he has practised in Townsville since the inception
of the Northern Supreme Court, 14 years ago, it
is evident he can stand the climate. And as he
was a prominent member of the Philp election
committees, it is obvious that he is a deserving
character.
“ M.”: There is little doubt now that the
days of the Kilp-Phidson Government are
numbered. The nominal Premier went North
a fortnight ago and met heavy weather
and a chill blast that would have frost-bitten the
Shackleton party. Now Home Secretary Bell is
playing up. Denham, Redwood and Jenkinson
are rocking, and Maxwell is so out of friends with
everybody that there is little chance of his again
facing the music. The Government is talking
about getting a dissolution if defeated, and for
this purpose has further deferred the meeting of
the House until the Chelmsford family has de-
parted, and Morgan is in the Deputy-GovernoFs
chair. Chelmsford would hardly repeat his
former dissolution blunder, for so long as
Bowman hasn’t had a turn at the Premier-
ship, the possibilities of forming a Ministry out of
the present Assembly aren’t exhausted. That was
the point which Chelmsford obligingly overlooked
last year, but there is a limit to the overlooking
of things. The chances are that Morgan may
notice the point too, and that the postponement
of the meeting of Parliament may pay no dividend
after all.
AN ATTITUDE OF DISDAIN.
FIRST SUPERIOR ONE: “I say, dear boy, where do you get your hat ironed,?”
SECOND SUPERIOR ONE (with, contempt): “I don’t—I buy a new one.”
Bananaland has abolished the plan of
hiring private agents to sell its public lands. A
couple of them got a good deal of fluff into their
nests at the game. For a time the groups which
were yarded up from the southern States helped
to boom settlement, but anomalies (to put it
mildly) crept in and led to a flood of complaints ;
so for the future the Department will conduct the
business by its own officers.
Portmaster John Mackay, one of Bananaland’s
celebrities, gets an extension of official life, though
he has passed both the allotted span and the Civil
Service retiring age. The explanation is that it
isn’t worth while appointing a new State official,
as the Australian Government will presently take
hold of coastal administration ; but, as a matter of
fact, Bananaland doesn’tknow where it could get
a young man who looks any more durable than the
ancient warrior. He comes from the Mackays of
Strathnaven, who dragged their kilts through
centuries of-chronic Scotch bloodshed in the days
when Scotland was a blanky land, with red hair
bn its head, and a sword the size of a precipice in
its hand, and a bull’s-hide shield on its left arm,
and a howl in its mouth, and porridge and stolen
beef and illicit whisky in its stomach. It was to
a Mackay that an English soldier cried out
“Quarter 1” in a certain battle, and got a memor-
able reply. “I’ve nae time to quarter ye,” said
Mackay, “but I’ll just cut ye in twa.” And
having done that he fled into the thickest of
the battle again, and proceeded to shake things
up a good deal. The sea-adventures of old John
Mackay, of Queensland, would fill a volume, and
his proceedings on dry land during the early
stormy times of Bananaland were highly interest-
ing. He travelled overland at the head of a party
in 1860, and discovered the Pioneer River where
Mackay now stands. Twenty years later he re-
turned there and found a white population of
20,000 people, and much objectionable, smellful,
rum-drunken Tommy Tanna. Now he seems
likely to live to see the last of the Tommy Tanna
desecration.
The Day the Mailman Comes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Mabel puts her hair in trim.
And Sis her brooches wears ;
When Emma, in the firelight dim,
The floury scone prepares ;
And at the sliprails brother Jim
Across the gloaming stares —
These signs and portents knowledge bring
To all the Bush—and you,
That Expectation, bright of wing,
Young Fancy flutters through—
For—as the kettle seems to sing—
“ To-night the mailman’s due.”
In slop-made suit of dusty brown,
And greasy wide-brimmed hat,
He comes, a welcome guest from town,
Each week to Reedy Elat,
And brings the latest cables down—
A fortnight old at that.
A cheerful, slow, bucolic wight,
Bowlegged and saddle-bred,
With lank, oiled hair an auburn bright,
And nose a blistered red,
He smokes and gossips thro’ the night
Till long past “time for bed.
The cables and the market news
The Old Man in his chair
Absorbs, and ventilates his views
On irresponsive air—
They have no precious time to lose
On Balkan troubles there ;
When Sandy Scott, his local store
Of current scandal, chat,
In-gathered eighty bush miles o’er,
Unloads to glad the Flat,,
And fills his briar pipe once more,
And spits across the cat.
For Milly Jones will married be
In either March or May ;
Old Doctor Dunn’s been on the spree-,
Six months—so people say —
And Wilson’s dance was goin’ free
’Till after break o’ day !
His tale of marriage, death and birth,
The district happ’nings small;
Those things of tragedy or mirth
That tears or laughter call,
The human things from o’er the Earth,
Long Sandy stocks them all.
The pen-scrawled words of love and trade ;
The missives honey-sweet,
In seal across his saddle laid,
He bears with air discreet;
Why should the pathway not be made
More pleasant to his feet ?
Why should he not the best beds get;
His plate the tit-bits hold ?
And by his knife a serviette
Be placed in careful fold.
With something special “for the wet,”
Or else to “ cure his cold ” ?
A golden link he makes, between
The world and Reedy Flat.
In dusty suit, and necktie green.
And greasy, soft, felt hat—
But Emma, turning seventeen.
Could tell you more of that.
No wonder Mabel curls her hair,
And Sis a ditty hums,
And Bill, with neither ear nor air,
The old piano strums —
Romance is in the clear bush air
The day the mailman comes.
E. J. B.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 24, 1909.
Mr Dear Thargomindah,—
I told you so !
Our pale Governor has been having: the time of
his life in the Papuan wilds. I rather expected
that he would get up to some mischief, but his
frivolity has passed my wildest expectations. He
has been hobnobbing with pearl-shellers and
making friends with monkey men. who gave
wrestling displays, and I gravely suspect that he
joined in the corroboree that followed. Anyway,
he danced at a fancy ball (possibly in the State
costume of a Papuan diplomatist) given by the
juvenile whites of the island. Lastly, he got loose
on a pearling lugger, and had to be forcibly
restrained when Captain Verney donned a diving
suit and went down six fathoms deep with his
leaded boots foremost. Now our slender Ex. is
on his way home with a wild pig in each pocket,
which animals, if you don’t keep a close eye upon
him, he’ll be letting loose in the Domain one of
these nights.
The wily chauffeur! What havoc he wreaks
upon the heart of the susceptible 20th century
damsel ! Take it from me, ye mothers who aim
at good matches for your chicks, he is a snake in
the grass and a serpent amid the vegetables.
Long ago Jeames, on the box, used occasionally
to upset the family marriage cart, yet a coachman
was a coachman, and his status was recognised.
He was just plain dog, and to love him entailed a
loss of caste. But a nasty indefiniteness sur-
rounds the chauffeur. There’s no real satisfac-
tion about him, and no known description fits
him. He’s neither dog nor sausage, so to speak,
and his smart suit, dust coat, cap, and even his
goggles, lend him an air of “ prince in disguise ”
that is unsettling to the young person.
All this by way of prologue to a pretty game of
hearts that “ tuff tuffs ” past my window daily in
a big family car. And won’t the fat be in the fire
one of these days when ma discovers the dog-

Ivy Craig, a Junoesque damsel of this city, the
possessor of a voice, and gifted with the tastes of a
mermaid, is to wed a nephew of your late State
Governor, one Appleyard. Where she discovered
her new property I don’t know, but a sight of her
swimming, or a sound of her singing, would bowl
out any average man for «. duck.
The youngest Newton chick, who was suspected
of intent to marry a military man, now announces
her purpose of allying herself with the other, and

It didn’t rain last Wednesday—it was rather
that the bottom fell out of the heavenly tank and
all the contents dropped at once. It threatened
ruin to the heavy ciop of weddings that came due
on that date. The big pastoral De Burgh Persse-
Co’lins alliance, which was to have taken place
in Beaudesert, had to be done in the house,
because the bride couldn’t swim well enough.
The athletic young bridegroom and his merry men
arrived clothed in jack-hoots and oilskins and
slouch hats. At the homestead of Tamrookum a
sudden change took place, and in 10 minutes an
i mmaculately-frocked groom and best and next-best
men trooped into the pretty drawing-room, where,
amid a bower of chrysanthemums and under crim-
son shaded lamps (the day was as black as the
heart of a defeated political candidate), the deed
was done. Later on, De Burgh packed his bride
into a covered phaeton, and they departed amid a
cloud of mud for a neighboring homestead, cn
route for the South.
Another wedding of note was that of Miss Nina
Vidgen and Mr. C. Crouch, two popular young
people of this city, who departed for the seaside
in a flood of water, rose leaves and good wishes.
As I write comes the sad tidings of the serious
illness of Mrs. (Did) Harris in Sydney, which
caused husband and daughter Leslie to depart to

Melbourne.
On Saturday last Kangaroo Point was electrified

formed by the officers swords for the bride and
groom to pass under.

The latest ex-cohentingenter to distinguish
himself is (or was) Hamilton Dickson, of Dulaeca
(Queensland). There was a casual public-house
quarrel between Dickson and Pring, but the
matter apparently blew over, and they shook
hands. Yet, though Pring blew over, it seems
that Dickson didn’t. Pring disappeared off the
face of the earth. After many days people began
to remark his failure to turn up to meals, and an
earnest search revealed his horse (shot dead), and
the remains of a fire with some human relics and
Pring’s gun-metal watch among the ashes. About
this stage of the proceedings ex-contingenter
Hamilton Dickson cut things short by putting a
bullet through his military head, and there will be
no sensational trial after all. The result of all this
is that quite a gloom has fallen over patriotic
Dulacca, and the local right-thinking person is
deploring things so hard that his crop is being
worried by crows, and the moth is breaking into
the local Anti-Sosh League and eating its
prineiples-
The recently-completed Geraldton-Harvey
Creek telegraph line seems to be about the
toughest bit of wire-erecting done in Australia for
some time. Although the line is only 26 miles
long it took 11 months to put up. One of the
causes of this was the density and heaviness of
the scrub thereabouts. In one place a fig-tree
measuring 30ft. across had to be cut through.
Wet weather also gave considerable trouble. At
times the men on the job were working up to
their knees in water. Once their camp was
flooded out, and another time they were isolated
by flood waters on the bank of the Russell River,
and lived for a week on sweet potatoes. Yet they
stuck to the job for 11 months in a place where it
is alleged the white man can’t work.
One of the best razors that reaches Australia
from the home of the finest razor-making manufactories
in the world is the “Plum” at 10/6, for which Messrs.
Craig and Aitken, of 654 George Street, Sydney are sole
agents. The “ Plum ” blade is made of unequalled steel,
specially hollow ground, and finally trued to a particu-
larly keen edge, and is justly famed for satisfactory
results. Its growing popularity speaks for itself, and the
price, though not the price of the common stock razor, is
low considering its superfine quality. For 10/6 Messrs.
Craig and Aitken send the “ Plum ” to any address, post
free, and guarantee to keep the razor in shaving order for
two years free of charge.*
The walloping of offenders with a cane is
one of the duties of the Binghi king at the Yar-
rabah (N.Q.) Aboriginal Mission. The other day,
he had to flog four of his subjects for pilfering,
and did it cheerfully. As he can’t whack himself,
he has a special punishment when he goes on the
crooked path—the white superintendent of the
mission deposes him for a while. Recently, he
was relieved of his crown and orb and sceptre and
brass plate and cane for a whole week.

THE GOLDEN CROPS OF WHEAT.
By J. D. FITZ GERALD.
The farmer of Queensland, aided by that expert
assistance which the Government utilities afford,
is coming to a knowledge of the best use to which
his land can be put; so that, by the expenditure
of the minimum amount of labor and capital, he
may get the very highest results. Thus it does not
always follow that the land will be used for the
purpose it was first put to. It has been shown
that maize growing, in certain districts, was
superseded by dairying, as the distant markets of
the world became accessible by the growth of
shipping facilities. Cotton growing in other
districts gave place to more profitable crops
where the local conditions conduced to larger
profits as a result of a change of the product.
There are immense tracts in Queensland which
are eminently suitable for wheat farming. The
HARVESTING OPERATIONS.—TYPICAL QUEENSLAND FARMING LANDSCAPE, GALTON.
Darling Downs and the Western areas have great
spaces suitable for cereal crops. The march of
development so far has gone on other lines than
the growing of crops for market. The natural
pasture grasses are so luxuriant that it may be
said that, for pastoral purposes-—for cattle,.horses
and sheep—Nature has provided the crops with a
prodigal hand. The Canadian, British and Con-
tinental farmer will think it incredible that-Nature
furnishes all the fodder necessary for fattening
and sustenance purposes on the great territories
of Queensland, when he has to grow his crops to
provide winter forage for his beasts. We can
realise the nature of these immense Queensland
natural pastures from a short description by Mr.
Randolph Bedford (the well-known Australian
novelist)
HARVESTING WHEAT WITH REAPER AND BINDER, NEAR WARWICK.
“There are,” he says (writing to the World’s
Work on the wonderful results of Governmental
aid in saving £2,000,000 worth of wool and meat
by bringing the sheep from droughty areas on to
better country during one bad season), “ there are
200 miles of Flinders grass growing between the
tussocks of the Mitchell—dry—a self-made hay—
and the finest of stock-fatteners. The plains have
adapted their grasses at the cost of many centuries
of experiment; the comparatively rainless condi-
tion of the country is perfection for the Mitchell
grass; rain at the time of its self-conversion to
hay would blacken and rot it. Reaped and stacked
and roofed, it will keep as hay for five years; yet
few men trouble to make the plenty of the good
years the stand-by of the lean. That this is the
right course to take is proved by the fact that two
men at the 30-mile coach change cut one hundred
tons and sold it for £5 a ton in the last drought;
few, however, have followed that excellent ex-
ample in this season of spendthrift plenty.”
This is by the way. The amount of territory
ON THE ROAD TO MARKET, GATTON, SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
under all crops in Queensland in 1907 was 642,979
acres, or about the seven-hundredth part of the
territory of the State. In 1906-7 the main crops
were wheat, maize, hay, green forage (lucerne,
etc.), and sugar-cane. Qf these wheat covered
114,575 acres, and produced 1,108,902 bushels,
valued at about £180,196. The time for our great
“ Epic of the Wheat ”is not yet. Wheat growing
may be regarded as in its mere infancy.
Its prospects are illimitable —for this reason.
Queensland is the nearest of the Australian States
which are in any way developed, to the teeming
millions of Eastern Asia. It has been a matter
much noted by those who have travelled in China
of recent years that the Chinaman is beginning to
regard flour with more favor than rice. All
classes above the mere coolie are beginning to look
upon flour as a necessity, rather than a luxury.
The Americans developed the market from their
distributing centres in Hongkong and Shanghai;
but when their goods were boycotted by the
Chinese in 1905, Australian flour came into use,
and it should have an immense future before it m
these regions, where hosts of men exist pn a coun-
try given over to rice and cotton culture,
So far Queensland must look to the future for
the time when she will have her share m trie ex -
ploitation of the markets of Eastern Asia. lor
the present, she has not produced enough flour to
supply her own markets. Thus, in the year IJO7
she imported 253,550 tons of flour from other parts
of the Commonwealth. Queensland is in the posi-
tion now which N.S.W. occupied in the ’SO’s and
’9o’s, in which period the Mother State devoted
herself to the crudest of the primary industries,
Thus, in 1890-1 the wheat crop of N.S.W. was
under four million bushels ; while in 1900-1 it was
over 16 million bushels, and this was accompanied
by a wonderful development of dairying and
mixed farming. Queensland mis magnificent
areas in the Western Downs district which could,
in time, furnish the wheatfields, not only for the
home requirements of the State, but for export to
the ends of the earth. Queensland may yet be a
factor in stopping the representatives of preda-
tory capital from exploiting the people sfood, and
may intervene at the right moment and make it
impossible for men like Patten, exploiter of the
Chicago wheat pit, to run up prices of the staff of
life in the homes of the working bees of other
nations thousands of miles from the scene of
his dramatic attempts to control the world’s
wheat supply. It must be remembered that
Australian wheat brings the highest price in
the world’s markets. In 1906 the prices realised
for Australian wheat topped those of the best
wheat-growing countries in the world. A few
comparisons of prices are interesting :
Average Prices of Wheat in 1906 per Imperial Quarter
at Mark Lane, London.
Argentina .. .. .. .. .. 29/10
Germany 27/7
Russia .. .. .. ■ ■ ■ • 79/10
U.S.A 30/11
Canada .. .. .. • • • • 30/8
British India 29/4
Australia 31/2
In the year treated (1906) Maoriland wheat
brought the top price, 325. 2d. per imperial
quarter; but the year before Australian wheat
brought 325. 4d., while M.L. brought only 30s. Id.
This is worth noting. The Commonwealth
Statistician accounts for our pre-eminence in this
way“ Generally speaking,” he says, “Aus-
tralian wheat shows a grain of bright, clear tex-
ture, rich in gluten, and of fine milling quality.
Its excellence is attested by the high price which
it realises in the English markets.”
The average yield of wheat in Queensland is
relatively high. In 1907 the average of that State
exceeded that of either Victoria or New South
Wales. Taking it over a period of years,
Queensland’s average is 13'8 bushels to the acre,
which is the highest yield of the Commonwealth
States but one, that of Tasmania. Being
at the crude beginnings of the industry, it cannot
be said that, so far, Queensland farmers have
completely adapted themselves to their environ-
ment. They are experimenting continually, and
seeking perfection. And, meanwhile, all the
great improvements in knowledge, in inventions,
in chemical analysis, in appliances, which the
modern world has at its service, are equally at the
service of the Queenslander. Thus the disastrous
consequences of rust in wheat have been overcome
by the aid of cross-fertilisation of suitable wheats,
and this has practically stamped out rust. And
there is the home market open to the farmer,
which is more immediately advantageous to him
than the outer markets of the world.
The active Department of Agriculture does
everything in its power to develop the efficiency
of the wheat industry and the productivity of the
soils and the varieties of wheat. Last year it
THE CHEMISTS AT WORK ON AN EXPERIMENTAL WHEAT FARM.
approached 100 wheat farmers, in different locali-
ties of Queensland, and supplied them with a
bushel of wheat each, in order that tests might be
made as to the suitability of particular brands of
wheat to the soils of the various localities. These
“stud” wheats have been thoroughly tested by
the different recipients, who have reported to the
Department, and lacer on the knowledge acquired
will be turned to account. Rust-resistant wheats
are being evolved. Last year experiments in the
milling qualities of different sorts of wheat were
carried out by the State Agricultural Chemist.
That wheat growing is susceptible of improve-
ment by scientific treatment is proved in a hun-
dred cases. The experiments in wheat growing
at Rothamsted, near London, which were initiated
by Sir John Bennet Lawes, Bart, (the dis-
coverer of superphosphate manures), are now
known to scientists throughout the world. And
all that science can do in the known world to in-
crease the productiveness of the wheats, either by
discoveries in manuring, analysis of soil, milling
tests, or selection of special wheats, will be at the
service of the Queensland farmer, who will be kept
informed by the State agencies.
The English experiments by Mr. Gorton in the
cross-fertilisation of wheat are well known. But,
after all, the common-sense of growing from the
largest and best ears has been known to every
Australian farmer for years past. Mr. Gorton’s
cross-fertilising has strengthened the selected
stocks, until it maybe said that he has created
new plants. In fact, it is claimed for him that he
has “ brought new plants into being.” He has
cross-fertilised his plants by using fertilising
agents obtained from weeds and vegetable pests,
and has harnessed the “enormous vigor, mar-
vellous reproductive power, and adaptability to
their environment” which the weeds possess to
the service of the new wheats.
In the rapid roll of Queensland development,
the forest land of to-day may become the wheat-
field of to-morrow. But, as the late Mr. Traill
pointed out, and he had travelled extensively,
there is little or no difference in appearance
between the Western Queensland sparsely tim-
bered or treeless country and the “ prairie” land
of the United States and Canada, about which we
hear so.much. It is on these great plains that you
find the “bonanza” farms of which we read,
ploughed by great navies of ploughs and stripped
by moving landscapes of stripping machines. In
Queensland the huge bonanza farm is unknown,
and the distribution of the land for farming pur-
poses is more equitable than in the United States.
Queensland is the Paradise of the small farmer.
Those almost feudal conditions of settlement
and tenure which we discover in a perusal of such
books as the late Frank Norris’s “ The Octopus ”
and “The Pit,” as existing in the United States,
are absent from the conditions of Queensland
farming. A few words from the State Statistician
will show how small the areas of the farms were ;
and these will act as an encouragement to the
emigrant who is looking towards the Common-
wealth. Says Mr. Thornhill Weedon, Queensland
State Statistician: —
“The greater proportion of farmers cultivated
land in blocks between five and 50 acres in extent.
There were last year 6090 persons who farmed
68,143 acres, in areas of five acres and less than 20
acres, giving an average of 11‘2 acres to each. And
there were 5257 persons cultivating 164,422 acres, on
farms between 20 and 50 acres, or an average of
31 3 acres each, making altogether 11,347 out of
17,271 farms returned. Of small holdings of less
than five acres each there were 2454, aggregating
6327 acres. Farms with a cultivation area exceed-
ing 50 acres numbered 3470, with a combined area
of 404,087 acres, or 63 per cent, of the total culti-
vated area. This gave an average of 116'5 acres
to each holding.”
The reader was told in a previous article how it
is possible for a man to make a splendid living on
a few acres by growing pineapples. In Queens-
land it is impossible for the railway combines and
money kings to “commandeer” the wheat pro-
duct, as is done in the United States, if one is to
believe the picture drawn in Norris’s fine works of
fiction. In our Queensland “epic of the wheat,’
which will be written in the days to come, there
will be no story of predatory bankers, crafty rail-
way men, soulless mortgagees, or Stock Excnange
gamblers. The State of Queensland owns the
system of land transportation, and supervises the
traffic as far as the ends of the world.
Nor has the prospective farmer need to fear the
terrible consequences of such pests as those de-
scribed in Newman’s vivid picture of third century
life, “ Callista.” Chapter xv., of the “Loss and
Gain ” novel written by the greatest modern master
of English style, shows one Of the plagues which
render Africa, with its vast territories, an unde-
sirable place for the emigrant, even at the present
day. So horrid was the locust, which, in its
swarms, ate everything before it in its North
African invasions, that one imaginative writer,
quoted by Newman, described it as having
“ the head of a horse, the eyes of an elephant, the
neck of a bull, the horns of a stag-, the breast of
a lion, the belly of a scorpion, the wings of an
eagle, the legs of a camel, the feet of an ostrich,
and the tail of a serpent.” We have nothing in
the way of pests to parallel this scourge. lhe
“ Granary of Rome,” as Africa was called, was
eaten out in a week by these locust pests, and
reduced to famine.
Wheat cultivation is only in its infancy m
Queensland, but when we mark its progress in
the neighboring State of New South Wales with-
in the last decade, and remember how much
richer the soil, and in how many respects more
favorable the climate of Queensland is to all
others, we can safely predict that this is one of
the natural industries of the country which is sure
to grow by leaps and bounds. The golden crops
may yet prove as great a source of wealth, per-
haps, as either the golden reef or the golden
fleece.

“DAD’S AND DAN.”
The New Waybabk Book you are bound to read, Is.
The Inky Way.
A family of inkslingers are the Pratts, of Australia and
elsewhere. The record of the tribe was recalled by the
recent marriage in Melbourne of Arthur 0. Pratt, one of
the younger members. He began as a freelance in
Westralia, joined the Perth Morning Herald, passed to
the 8. M. Herald, and changed to Hobart Mercury. He
has two brothers, Fred and Byd, on the Herald, while his
father, for many years a prominent Sydney pressman, is
now on Melbourne Age. But this does not end the tally,
as two of the elder Pratt family push the fountain-pen in
London, and their father had the same failing in the
English midlands. It is not stated whether the infants
of the clan have started to cover themselves with blots in
their early attempts at literature, but the chances are
that they' have.

“D.”: The People, the Tory London Sunday paper
which has lately been cast in ±lOOO damages for alleging
that Lloyd George, the British Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer, had paid away good legal tender-to avoid being-
sued in a divorce suit, is the only journal I know which
was once edited by a person of royal descent. The late
Colonel “ Gussie ” Fitzgeorge, a son of the old Duke of
Cambridge, ran the sheet for a while about 14 years ago.
It was misconducted somewhat on the lines of the
Saturday editions of our evening papers—seven-
eighths being stolen from the current London
dailies, and the other fraction containing the paper’s
rabidly Conservative policy, expressed in an indifferent
brand of grammar. None who saw the Colonel (with his
brother “ Dollie ”) padding in intensely deliberate fashion
along Bond-street years ago would have taken the mili-
tary potentate for a journalist. He was a tall, vacuous-
looking person, with a beautiful figure, and unimpeach-
able clothes. His prevailing characteristic was utter
languor and indifference to the sordid details of life (which
are the things your day-by-day writer must be absorbed
in, or file his schedule). But perhaps the Colonel wasn’t a
journalist. Brooding on the awful sheet for which he
was responsible, I am fain to think he was not.

“J.W.” rambles about a printery : Edgerton and
Moore’s, the oldest business in Melbourne’s “inky way,”
went under the hammer lately'. Fifty-seven years
ago a pair by' the name of Trembath and Goodhugh
started a printing office in Flinders-lane. In those days,
a timber yard stood on the present site of Sargood’s ; just
round the corner, the Age had its modest publishing
office, whilst not far away, in a lane near the G.P.0.,
the Evening Herald crept furtively forth as soon as
it was dark. Trembath caught the gold fever, left his
presses, and made for the fields. His place was taken by
a party named Hough. Hi 1854 a strike occurred at the
Argus office. Goodhugh and Hough came briskly for-
ward and set up the embarrassed daily' in their establish-
ment. Later their premises were burnt down. Of course
the strikers Were blamed for the fire, but their
guilt was never proved. When the premises were
rebuilt, William Moore, an old Herald man, took over
the business. From then onwards, many' of Melbourne’s
best-known printers were connected with the firm.
James Fergusson (Fergusson and Mitchell), William Det-
mold, J. M. Tait (about the most ancient printer in
Melbourne), Stewart, Bird, McCarron, Brown, Prior, and
Watt all drew money from it. Other prominent citizens
who worked in this office were George Fisher, of
Maoriland, who was at one time an apprentice,
and the late Janies Munro, knight, who was a
pressman. In its palmiest publishing days the
office produced many important literary works,
and it was a common thing when doing business there to
bump into Henry Parkes, James Bonwick, F. L. Smvthe,
James Blair, Francis Ormond, “ Garryowen,” and other
litterateurs of the time. Almost every weekly' and
monthly in Melbourne has at one time or another been
issued from this ancient printery, from the Baptist to the
K. O. Advocate and Tribune ; from the sober S. S.
Teacher to the giddy Table Talk. Not only the Argus,
but the short-lived People’s Daily was at one time
helped out.
•* * * *
A Melbourne daily pressman tells this story of a
political pilgrimage. The party had come to the con-
stituency of an eloquent and pertinacious member, and
there was a sort of social shivooon. The member was chair-
man, and he called upon this person and that to enter-
tain the company'. It was noted that nobody refused,
although in many cases it would have been hospitable to
have done so. At length the eye of the member lit upon
the pressman. There was a gleam of exultation in that
eye. He called upon the scribe to sing. The scribe was
eagerly declining, when a sort of Bill-Jim resident edged
in behind and nudged him. “ For the love of Heaven,
sing!’’said Bill-Jim. “But I am a rotten singer,” ex-
claimed the pressman. “I dare say,” replied Bill-Jim,
“ but if you don’t sing he will, and no man on gorsearth
can sing as bad as him. Whenever any body refuses he
sez he must reluctantly fill the vacant place in the pro-
gramme himself.” Then the scribe got up and sang his
very' worst.
AUSTRALIAN SONG; A WHIT-HEN-AUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Shall we Whit Whitily ?
Pieaseth me rather to Hen.
Jingle of rime hath its place,
Measure of rhythm its charm,
But the measureless rhythm caught from the warm deep
bosom of things,
This is more—far more.
Haste of the steed fast driven with its clatter of hoofs,
Wash of the long waves curling and blanching in foam,
Golden effulgence of fading even,
Croak of the night-frog,
Hum of the droning bee,
Twitter of birds in the dew-light,
And the old, grey wonder of things
Shot with the old, old glamor of wizard gold—
Who knoweth these things may Hen.
He who would Whit
Must have his nose attuned,
Hollowed behind for all Yaukeeness,
His must be choice of all words
Harshest of utterance,
Skill to destroy
For the sake of a thought or of no thought
The music of things—
This is to Whit with a Whitman,
Pieaseth me rather to Hen with a Henley.
Yet, of a truth,
Were it not better to Aust with Australia,
Taking whatever of best all the gods may nave given
Before to all bards that have chanted,
Even from David, who sang to Lite wife of Uriah
Old Hebrew thought-rimes love-laden.
To Kipling, with phrases of jingo gold
Set stiffly in wooden-legged verses ;
From Omar to wonderful Austin,
The Alfred who singeth to Ned.
All that had strength to endure
Down through the years,
All that would glow transplanted
In a new clean air and soil,
All that glowing would mix with the new clean things,
This is Australia,
Yea, in spite of.the evil that cryeth,
And the liars that lie all day long,
This is the real Australia.
So let us take of all —
Let us Dave it with David,
Home it with Homer,
Shake it with Shakespeare,
Shell it with Shelley,
Goet it with Goethe,
Let us steal from them all with a skill that shall not
betray us,
Let us take of them all and enweave it with gum leaves
and sunshine—
This is to Aust.
Bosh ter the breath of the morning
Breathed through the bu-h,
Drink in its blanky glory,
Open your eyes and your heart,
Collar a bullock-yoke handy,
String it with greenhide, make music, and sing like the
Devil—
Aust with Australia 1
Aust!

Some remarks by a London weekly on
Britain’s new “Territorial” Army are worth the
consideration of young Australia :
The electors are taught to think, and they seriously do
believe, that the time which an occupied citizen can
spare from his business is sufficient to enable him to learn
the soldier’s craft. If the craft to be learned were watch-
making', engine-driving or navigation, everybody would
see the absurdity of such a notion. Continuous and de-
termined application for many months is necessary to
impart even the rudiments of soldiering to the most de-
voted and patriotic citizen. Seaside camps for a week or
a fortnight are not soldiering. Even the Druids under-
stood the seriousness of war better than our rulers. The
Druidical mobilisation system provided that the last man
rolling up to muster after being called to arms was
burnt It is not enough to glow with patriotism, or
to commend patriotism. We must do the things essential
to salvation. And now a word to the girls and matrons.
My dear ladies, you are the people who make or mar the
men. If skulking is fashionable, and “ rotting” national
service not disgraceful, you are responsible. Matron and
maid ! Keep your favors for those who accept the burden
of manhood. One girl may shame a dozen wasters into
national service.

WHY don’t you stop it? You are still doctoring, but changing doctors does not cure
you. You are trying one medicine after the other with the same disgusting disappoint-
ment. You are a “ medicine doser,” and the only change in your condition is for the worse.
Why don’t you stop this medicine habit ? Why don’t you avail yourself of
the modern remedy ? Proceed on Nature’s own lines. Use the life-giving, healing,
strengthening forces of Electricity ! This is the electric age. You can see on every
hand the wonders of Electricity. You don’t need doctors; you don’t need medicine,
for medicine gives no nourishment. You DO need Electric Life Force. Use it as we
apply it and you will be well, strong and happy.
Nearly every ailment which afflicts humanity, outside of contagious diseases, is due to the breaking-
down of some vital organ. When a certain part fails to do its allotted task the entire human
machinery goes to smash. The only way to regain health —even life —is to rebuild the weak part
which has caused all the trouble by obtaining a new supply of vital electric energy. This can
only be properly done with the new improved
dr. McLaughlin s electric belt.
There is no disputing the virtue in Electricity as a cure for weakness and pains. The brainiest doctors living now admit it, but there has
been a doubt that anyone had mastered the best way of applying it. The doctor’s battery is crude—shocks too much, and at best can only be
applied for half-an-hour at a time, which is not enough to do any good. Those other machines in a doctor’s office never reach the trouble. . .
Electricity, as applied by DR. McLAUGHRIN’S ELECTRIC BELT, is the modern, up-to-date method. No shock, no burning or
blistering, and you wear it for hours at a time while sleeping or during the day.
£,500 REWARD.
V7o guarantee every Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt sold by us to give a powerful current of
genuine electricity which can bo instantly felt, and we will forfeit £5OO to anyone proving
the contrary.
It is a quick and lasting cure for Debility, Weakness of all kinds, Varicocele, Rheumatism, Weak Back, Sciatica,

“Ak.”: A friend who was at the Show
lunch—Nyhesre His Ex. castigated our Anti-Sosh
politicians for abusing his Ministers to his face and
behind their backs—assured me that the most
diverting part of the business was a' study of the
countenances of the majority of the lunchers
before, during and after the painful affair. They
were all obviously panting to please the Governor
at any cost. Their loyalty was something stu-
pendous. At each mention of the Flag they
cheered wildly ; when the worn old Dreadnought
subject was banged on the table they yelled with
joy; and when words of rebuke and contempt were
spilled on the man Fisher they went fairly fanti.
And always they watched Himself, with dog-lik'e
attention, and strove to pierce the imperturbable
mask which is upon his face, and find what was
at the back of that sleek, well-coiffed head. They
weren’t left in doubt for long when he got on his
legs. And then it was a glorious sight to observe
swift change of attitude. Stout worthies,
who had applauded Mr. Wade’s angry references
to the way the Australian Government proposed
™ ) ™ rl S the States, frowned darkly when Lord
Dudley hinted it was a wrong thing on Mr.
Wade’s part to orate on such controversial sub-
jects in his presence. “Wade’s a fool,” they
muttered cholerically. “ A tactless blunderer.
Ought to be dashed well ashamed of himself drag-
ging politics into a function of this sort.” And then
Mr. Cook was condemned as a vulgar stirrer up of
strife, and hopes were expressed that the Lord
Mayor vvouldn’t get his knighthood after all for
his criminal stupidity in projecting himself and
his Dreadnought business into an atmosphere that
should surround nothing but cows and sheep and
mangel wurzels. The elderly gentleman who
cheered frantically on hearing Mr. Fisher assailed
as a confirmed State-betrayer, and then cheered
still more frantically on hearing the assailer of
Mr. Fisher put severely in his place, was a de-
plorable but quite common feature of the
gathering.

By this paper’s Stipendiary Chow
News reminiscent of the Japanese occupation of North-
erh Australia, as described in the Lome Hand story, “The
Commonwealth Crisis,” has just drifted this way. Some
14!)mjles north-east of Hongkong- lies the PrataS Reef—
an island belonging to China. Awhile back, some Chinese
fishermen engaged about the place called-loudly to,the
Viceroy of Canton for help, alleging that a party of
Japanese had driven them off, burnt their junks, de-
stroyed a temple, and hoisted the Ape flag over the ruins.
Official representations to Japan brought the reply that
the report was only a fish-yarn—there wasn’t a Jap with-
in miles of Nevertheless the Chinese Govern-
ment sent along a couple of gunboats under the command
of Captain Woo (the same officer whose capture of the
cun-running Japanese steamer, Tatsu Maru, led up to the
big boycott). Woo found the Jap flag on the island all
right; in addition he found depots, houses, piers, trollies
running on rails, tortoise-breeding farms, water-tanks,
shops, etc. ; also a couple of hundred Japanese removing
guano as fast as they could dig'it out. The Japs talked
big at Woo for awhile, but Woo pointed gracefully to
his two gunboats, and suggested the lowering of the
Japanese flag. The calico was lowered, and more palaver
happened. Jap remarked courteously that he owned the
isiand, and in proof pointed to a post inscribed “Dis-
covered on the eighth moon of the 40th year of Meiji,”
i e., about 18 months ago. Woo, with equal courtesy,
asked where was the Chinese temple that stood on the
island much more than 18 months ago. Jap didn’t know
'he whereabouts of the temple, but observed curtly,
“ The island was thrown up by a volcano just before we
found it.” “With 10ft. of guano-ready-made on top of
it,” replied Woo, politely. “Anyhow, we’re here now,”
quoth Jap. “You won’t be here much longer,” con-
cluded Woo. Then Woo took photographs of the
depots, etc., as evidence of the Jap occupation, and
hied him home. Thereupon followed more repre-
sentations to the Jap Government, which at first
flatly; denied that any Japs were on the island.
When Woo knocked the bottom out of that yarn
with his testimony, backed by his photographs,
the Jap authorities admitted that they knew their
countrymen were there, but declared that they had re-
garded Pratas as a no-man’s land, and sought to end the
discussion by announcing that they wouldn’t insist upon
the occupation. But the Cantonese wanted to know
about the estimated 5,000.000 yen worth of guano, pearl,
and tortoise-shell collared by the Japs ; and at latest re-
ports they were hinting loudly that a, revival of the boy-
cott wouldn’t be a bad thing if the Jap Government
didn’t say something satisfactory about the missing

Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery
for Coughs and Colds.
POST-MORTEM examinations of healthy men who have met their death by accident
nearly always disclose tubercular scars in the lung tissue, showing that the subject had
at some time or other been attacked by the germ of Consumption, but had been strong
enough to resist its inroads.
These healed-up places in the lungs afford indubitable evidence of the curability of Lung
Troubles in their earlier stages. At any time the Consumption Germ may lodge in the lungs
of the most healthy of us and commence to multiply ; but if our constitutions are sound and
unweakened by a cold or other chest trouble these germs are speedily killed by the blood
corpuscles, whose task that is, leaving behind nothing but a scar to show where their deadly
work was nipped in the bud.
Hence the necessity of dealing with a cold, sore throat, or cough, directly the first
symptom is felt.
Consumption only too frequently arises from a neglected cold, which depresses the system
and presents a favorable opportunity for the Consumption Germ to fasten on our lungs and
multiply.

A very instructive example of Consumption being cured in

persons, as well as by those whose lungs are threatened.
A WONDERFUL CURE .
Suffered Three or Four Years, Coughing- Day and Night.
Breathing So Bad, Could Hardly Speak.
A Remarkably Quick Recovery.
THE SHELDON DRUG CO., LTD., SYDNEY.
Dear Sirs,—
“ For three or four years I was very ill. During- this time, not for
a single hour did I feel myself. My throat was always itching and
tickling. I was coughing all day and all night. It was a dry, hack-
ing cough, and I could cough up nothing. My breathing was strained
and heavy, and people said I was going into Consumption fast. I
looked hollow-cheeked and haggard, and lost considerable weight.
All day long while at work I felt weary and depressed, and when I
came home of an evening I would have to go straight to bed. My
breathing was often so bad I could hardly speak. Sometimes I was
laid up for days at a time. Chemists’ and doctors’ medicines did me
no good, and I took them by the gallon. As the days went on I grew
worse and worse. The coughing shook me to pieces, and gave me bad
headaches. One day when I was lying in bed, feeling- very bad, I read
about Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery. I sent for a bottle, and obtained
an almost immediate benefit. It loosened the oough so that I could
get rid of a lot of phlegm. The itching in the throat got less and less.
I took five bottles in all during a period of about three weeks, and by
that time was absolutely cured of every sign or symptom of my cough,
and began to put on weight rapidly. I have never been ill since.
Considering I was ill for four years, to get cured in three weeks seems
to me to be remarkably quick work.”
Y'ours faithfully, A. W. COLLING.

Grand Dairying Country, indeed, is MOUNT
LARCOMBE ESTATE, which we are now
subdividing. To the dairyman, the most import-
ant question is one of water, and this is answered
most satisfactorily at Mount Larcomhe. The
average rainfall there is 43 inches, and every
block is permanently watered by running streams.
The flats are very fertile, splendidly adapted for
maize, potatoes, and lucerne. The hills are
warm and sheltered, and the whole Estate pro-
duces those rich luscious grasses that mean a
big butter yield.
MOUNT LARCOMBE

fares we pay from any part of the States.

SIX off, and still unbroken—
No fretting bridle bar.
No spur has left its token,
No girth has left its scar.
Free as the wind that follows
Its own unfettered will;
Free as the wheeling swallows,
He rests or revels still.
The Bush is stall and manger,
His grooms are wind and sun;
Dusk chieftain, pallid stranger,
He payeth toll to none !
The Bush is st- ’l and manger,
He snorts and stands aloof,
And flouts the face of danger
With rout of ringing hoof.
Heads low his comrades waddle
In weary ways of graft;
Galled withers ’neath the saddle,
Galled ribs against the shaft.
Where jocund kookaburras
Make merry on the bough,
Above the long brown furrows,
His playmates pull the plough.
On dusty road and dreary,
Or broken bridle track,
They wander far and weary,
And weary wander back.
No one demands his leisure.
From burden or from chain
He waits no master’s pleasure
To take the track again.
And only he runs idle
In pasture lands of Fate,
Unvexed of bit or bridle,
Or reekless rider’s weight.
Runs idle—who shall blame him ?
He flings the gauntlet down,
The man that dares to tame him
Shall take him back to town !
The sprites of earth and ocean,
The war of wind and flood,
Old Freedom’s rebel potion
Run riot in his blood !
Bold outlaw, reckless liver,
But by that dainty tread
And that red nostril’s quiver
Ye know him thoroughbred !
Six off, and still unbroken,
No saddle-mark shall stain
That satin coat for token
Of mastery and domain.
Dream no.t, your bondage leaden
That flashing eye shall blur,
Nor dream those flanks shall redden
And reek beneath the spur !
A monarch of the ranges,
A sultan of the plains,
A spirit that estranges
Fell Fear from his domains !
Wild as the wind of Heaven,
Fierce as the leaping flame,
He scorns your coward leaven —
And who shall gire him blame ?
VICTORIA.

The Tool and His Money.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Dan Brophy’s uncle died,
leaving a fortune of £5O to his
“beloved nephew,” Dan’s true friends
were appalled at the change it made in him. His
wife, who had expected at least the price of a
“daeint silk dhress ” from the lord of her pulse,
expected in vain, and Cassidy and Mabony, who
worked beside him in the drains of the “ Car-r-
-poration,” counting confidently on an era of
beer, were shocked to find that not one shout
came from the man they had trusted. From the
careless, genial, navvy soul, who, drawing each
week £2 Bs. from the “ Cir-rporation,” spent the
odd eight shillings on Saturday evenings at
Geoghegan’s Sewerman’s Arms, he became
cautious and sober. That was the worst sign—
SOBER!
“’Tis ahlwis th’ way—monney do be shpilin’
lots of dacent fellies,” said Geoghegan upon the
third Saturday evening, and Cassidy and Mahony
gloomily agreed. And on Monday they refused
to speak to Dan at his work, which made Dan
angry. So when Cassidy started telling Mahony
all about the incredible habits of misers, he
was rolled over in the good old way by Dan,
and discovered that wealth had not impaired
Dans physical powers, whatever' evil it had
wreaked upon his soul.
Dan had no knowledge of high finance. He did
not know the difference between a P.N. and a
current account. He had a vague idea that
“ Dr.” on the top of a ledger meant “ Docthor ”
and that “ Cr.” stood for “ Councillor.” He was,
you will please observe, a very ignorant fellow,
lacking enlightenment upon the subject of the
gods of Israel. Absolutely the only documents
which he understood were pawn-tickets. So,
when the cheque came, endorsed by Messrs. Pur-
chase and Costs, he turned it over and over, and
scratched his head, and, having lostall his friends,
took it to his wife. She showed herself full of
scorn at his simplicity.
“Ban, me mahn,” she said, “ye’ve bin done.
.They want ye to take thot little bit iv pa-aper
instid iv y’ure fifty pound. Oi’ve heard iv thim
thrieks befure.”
“But,” replied Dan, “here ut says: ‘Pay
Daniel Brophy the sum iv fifty pound ’ !”
.. , r °ight,” scoffed the wife of his bosom.
Take it to th’ ba-aker thin.”
bought was a good idea, and took it.
lhe baker was suspicious, and Dan, who had
heard a good deal about lawyers, and very little of
that to the credit of the profession, came back
nome, and, arraying himself in purple and fine
linen—a magenta tie represented the purple—
went into Melbourne to make inquiries. He
flamed into the office of Messrs. Purchase and
Costs like the archangel Gabriel, and threw the
cheque upon the table in front of a thin young
man in quiet, grey tweeds. The thin young man
looked up.
“ That’s a nice tie you’ve got on,” he said
gravely.
Dan paid no attention to the compliment. “Oi
want me money,” he declared.
“Ah ! I perceive you are an Irishman. Cead
viilhe failthe, colleen og,” replied the young man
suavely. “ Won’t you sit down ? ”
Dan sat down, cowed for a moment by the sheer
novelty of this strange young man. Then, a little
more civilly, “ Oi want me money. Oi s’pose
y’u’re th’ boss ? ”
“ Unfortunately, no, Mr. Purchase is at pre-
sent drawing and engrossing a brief for counsel in
a writ of Ji fa. Mr. Costs is up at the Divorce
Court directing a case for separation a mensa et
thoro. But I really must ask you where you got
that tie. It’s one of the brightest things I’ve
seen for years. We get so little of brightness, of
gaiety, in the grim precincts of the Law, Mr.”
—he looked at the cheque—“er—Brophy.”
“ Oi got ut fr’m a crimson Afghan,” said Dan,
nervously.
“It is very beautiful,” replied the other,
wistfully.
“Ut ought t’ be,” was Dan’s comment. “Oi
paid fourpince f’r ut.”
The clerk gazed dreamily at the tie. There was
quite a long silence. Dan shuffled his feet upon
the floor. Then his conqueror picked up the
cheque. “Pardon me, I quite forgot,” he said.
“ You wish to cash this ? Take it to the United
Federal Bank, just round the corner, in Collins-
street. I assure you it is quite in order.” Dan
rose. “Mind the step —good-day, Mr. Brophy.”
As the door closed the suave young man turned
wearily back to his “notice to produce.”
So Dan went to the United Federal Bank and
disorganised the business of that institution for
just over half an hour. By accident, or instinct,
be found his way to the paying teller. The pav-
ing teller was a long, slim youth with a languid
air of complete detachment from the institution
by which he was paid. His chief aim in attend-
ing the bank seemed to be the decoration of the
premises with his beautiful clothes and nicely
brushed hair. He wore a prodigious collar and a
very small pale lavender tie, which he was care-
fully adjusting before a little mirror when the
furious Dan blew in upon his peace. Dan leaned
over the counter, holding out his cheque. The
teller went on fixing his tie. Dan continued to
hold out the cheque. The teller continued to fix
his tie. Dan began to get annoyed. Just as he
was about to explode, the teller took the cheque,
and, giving his tie a final pat, tapped the docu-
ment thoughtfully with his manicured forefinger.
He handed it back to Dan. “Can’t pay on
that,” he said shortly, turning to the mirror
again.
Dan started to climb the counter. “ Oi t’ought
there was somet’ing cronk about ut,” he bellowed.
Alarm seized the Adonis as Dan’s big, red hand
reached out for him. “Thqre’s nothing cronk,”
he replied quickly. “Only—you want to take it
to the ledger-keeper over there.”
Dan looked over to the row of grinning ledger-
keepers. “Which wan?” he growled, sus-
piciously.
The teller told him the one at the end.
“Ah!” said Dan. “ Th’ wan wid the boss-
eye?” And the smile died from the face of one
of the row quite suddenly. He took the cheque
across—it was sulkily snatched from his hand and
endorsed. Then he took it back to the teller.
“How’ll you have it?” inquired the latter.
“In me hand,” said Dan, firmly.
“ I mean, gold or notes ? ”
Dan, with fortune so close to him, became a
little excited. He retained sufficient presence of
mind, however, to say that he would have gold.
He got it, and dropped two of the sovereigns on
the floor. The bank porter stooped to pick them
up for him, but Dan’s foot descended on his hand
just as it came down on oneof the coins. “Hands
off!” said Dan, stooping and collecting his own,
while the porter examined his fingers and swore.
Then Dan counted all the money carefully at one of
the tables, while all the bank officials neglected the
other customers to watch him.
The ceremony of counting complete, Dan took
the money back to the lavender tie. “Yous
moind monney f’r blokes ? ” he inquired. “ Loike
a sa-avin’s bank ? ”
The teller admitted that this was some part of
the purpose of the bank.
“Thin moind this f’r me,” commanded Dan,
spreading it out on the counter. “Y’see”—he
leaned confidentially across the counter, and the
teller shuddered at the smell of onions, “Av Oi
lave ut at home me ould woman’ll be bound t’
foind ut.”
“Take it to the next counter,” said the teller
faintly.
So Dan took it to the next counter, and was
sent on to the “New Accounts” department,
and, with his tongue hanging dangerously out,
scrawled his name in a large book, and became a
depositor with a current account. After which
he strode out of the bank with the air of a Pier-
Eont Morgan, and went home to show his pass-
ook to his wife. She was not impressed.
“ Take care iv ut ! ” she sniffed. “ Wance Oi’d
had it in me hand loike thot, ’tis Oi wud be
ta-akin’ care iv ut mesilf.”
“F’r Hiven’s sake, hould yer jaw ! ” answered
Dan. “ The yoong fellies at the bank tould me
Oi c’d have ut anny toime Oi wanted.”
“Av Oi was you, thin, Danny, me mahn, ’tis
mesilf ud be havin’ ut to-morry.”
Dan laughed, but the seeds of mistrust had been
sown. And so, that night, he lay awake and
thought of his fifty pounds aione and unprotected
in the hands of strangers. What a fool he had
been not to keep it when he had it. He
determined that he would look in at the bank
next day and see that they had not dipped into
his store. He looked in. The paying teller was
still adjusting his tie—a pearl-grey one to-day.
He explained to Dan that he would have to buy
a cheque-book. Dan, after demur, bought one.
Then, after having the method of drawing a
cheque carefully unfolded to him, he sat down,
and ten minutes later brought this to the counter :
The teller took it and began to laugh. Then he
showed it to the receiving teller, who also
laughed. The rest of the officials came and looked
at the document —more laughter. And when the
cheque had been taken in to the General Manager
(who had it framed as a curiosity), Dan had

Suffered Agony for Five Long Years—
Life was a Perfect Misery.
If you have indigestion, you may recognise it by these symptoms-feverish headache
and coated tongue on rising in the morning; heavy, dull, and listless feeling all day ;
sleepless nights ; feeling of fulness after eating ;
severe pain in chest and. hack after meals; pain
and distension of abdomen. There are innumer-
able other symptoms of indigestion, for digestion
begins the moment the food enters the mouth,
and continues until it is turned into tissue-build-
ing blood by the stomach and bowels. For all
forms of indigestion Bile Beans are a sovereign
remedy.
Mr. li. J. Tucker, a hairdresser, residing at
Franklin Street, Adelaide, says:—“For the past
five years I have been troubled with Indigestion
and Dyspepsia. I suffered awfully at times, but
could get nothing to give me relief. The Indiges-
tion made my life a perfect misery. I could not
attend to my work. I lost all appetite, and suffered
from vomiting and chronic headaches, and all day
long hot, sour water kept rising into my mouth.
Doctors’ medicines did me no good. One day I received
one of your pamphlets bearing on Bile Beans, and
reading of cases similar to my own that had been cured
by Bile Beans, I decided to give them a trial. It now
gives me great pleasure to state that I am completely
cured of Indigestion, the credit of which is solely
due to Bile Beans.”
1
BILE BEANS are the PROVED cure for BILIOUSNESS, HEADACHE,
INDIGESTION, CONSTIPATION, PILES, DEMiLITY, FEMALE WEAKNESSES,
NERVOUSNESS, BAD BLOOD, PIMPLES AN-D ALL SKIN ERUPIIONS, BAD
BREATH ANAEMIA, and, in fact, all ailments that ow# their origin to defective bile
.flow, assimilation and digestion. Bile Beans are obtainable from all chemists and stores,
at Is. and 2s. 9d. per box (2s. 9d. size contains three times the Is. l£d.).

Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
iia improving the beauty of the sKin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pear3* Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
skin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre-
eminent degree as

another filled up for him. He signed it, and
received his money. As the teller handed it over,
he asked Dan whether he wished to olose his
account. Dan counted the cash twice and handed
it hack. It was all there. His confidence in the
bank was re-established.
During the first week Dan came three times for
a careful counting of his fortune. During the
second he came twice; during the third, once;
and, for a long while, once a week was his tally.
His absolute trust in the bank at length made him
careless, and lie missed five weeks. In the
interval five shillings disappeared.,
He was not slow to notice the odd silver amongst
the gold, and. when he had verified theloss, his
remarks shook the plaster down from the gilded
capitals of the banking chamber. They had begun
to rob him—his wife had told him all along that
they would. Where, lie asked, with vulgar em-
phasis, was the missing “dollar?” He didn’t
want any of their jaw ; all he well desired
was his money. Would the bank give
it to him? In vain the teller sought to inform
him of the usual bank charge upon current
accounts. This open confession of the,robbery
maddened Dan. He put the remains of his for-
tune in his trousers pocket, and, calling upon
Heaven to abolish the scarlet bank, started his old
trick of climbing the counter. But the forces of
the bank had gathered. The porter, three clerks,
and a casual customer threw themselves upon
him, and, after a short but animated struggle,
fired him into the street with a threat of instant
arrest if he crossed the threshold again. But he
was satisfied—he had got his five-shillings’ worth
out of the porter’s uniform, and one of the bank
clerks sported a black eye for ten days. The feel-
ing of satisfaction was almost as keen as though
he had toyed with a policeman, and there was
not the aftermath of a belting in the cells, nor a
fine of two pounds and damages. Taking it all
round, it had been well worth,the money.
Wherefore Dan walked happily down the street
with his hand in his pocket amongst the gold.
For awhile he did not notice the Polite Stranger.
The Polite Stranger had been a witness of the
scene in the bank, and shepherded Dan down the
street while he formed his plan of attack. He
passed a friend, an irreproachable person in a
frock coat and a silk hat. “ Take off that
hat,” he said, rudely. “ This cove’ll shy at style.
Honest lago’s the dart.. I’m going to steer him
into Antonio’s. Fiji’s good enough for him.
Get!” The silk hat got.
Then the Polite Stranger stepped alongside,
holding out his hand, and beaming. Dan took
the hand because he couldn’t think of anything
better to do. “ Good-day, Mr. Brophy,” said the
Polite Stranger. And forthwith Dan had it all—
how the bank had. after all, decided to be honest,
and had sent the Polite Stranger to make restitu-
tion. Here Dan received five shillings. After
that it was all over.. Who could doubt a man
who gave one five shillings ? So the Fijian Uncle
worked like a charm, and it was not until Dan
had waited four hours in Antonio’s that the awful
truth dawned upon him. When it did, he threw
a bottle through a mirror, and ran yelling out
into the streets. Here he was collared by “Mad
Mick,” who, with the aid of a cruising plain-
clothes man, “shot him in.”
And lo ! next Saturday Dan’s two friends,
Cassidy and Malionv, fell upon his neck as he
came into the dusky haven of Geoghegan’s bar.
Dan’s loss in money was their gain in fellowship.
But the greatest gain was to Geoghegan. One
cannot have too many fools working for him.
HASSAN.
The Breaking of the Drought.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rnms is one of the things to remember
all one’s life—one of the small things, like
surveyors’ pegs, scattered here and there
in the years. This is the breaking of a drought,
not many years ago. For months the land was a
desolation of heat, dust, twanging wire fences,
and awful silences, embroidered with the gruesome
notes of the crow. For months the promise of
rain had come, and passed on. Over and over
again the sky had become pregnant, but had borne
no fruit ; and our hearts were weary as the earth.
I remember a Wednesday morn that burst
in intense heat from the hills, when nothing
moved on the face of the earth but dust gliding
to and fro—the wanton dancing girl of the drought.
That awful noon little ruffled bodies fell from
the pepper-trees to the path, slain by the heat,
and an old cattle-dog crept in on to the dining-
room oilcloth and died. It was too piteous for
tears, with the dying all around. As noon crept
past a terrible feeling oppressed us that we had
come to the end of endurance, while, outside, the
plains still rocked in the sun, in a terrible mono-
tony, save for a peculiar dimness on the horizon,
as of a blurring of the sight.
At four o’clock I crept from under the bed
(always the coolest place), and noticed that a
shadow seemed to have fallen over all. The one
hopeful being in a house of unbelievers, I made
for the verandah. Truly a shadow, or more as if
the shadow of a shadow, lay on the earth, and a
terrible stillness. And in the east, far away,
stretched an enormous cloud, as if millions and
millions of black feathers had been blown into the
sky. It gave the semblance of gigantic wings,
and as it grew, covering the heavens, it seemed as
if also a huge foot was speeding across the hills.
I caught sight of the Celestial cook sitting stolidly
beside the tank, but he only shrugged indifferent
shoulders in face of that fearsome sky. It may
have been seconds, it may have been hours, before
those terrible wings had gathered us up beneath
them. There was an un-nerving tension, as if
Nature were expectant of some coming horror.
Nothing stirred ! Looking to the hills, I saw the
gums leaning breathlessly against the sky.
' Suddenlv it came. The tension broke as a banjo
string breaks, and a great wind belched from the
heavens. As a knife slices a carrot, the stricken
gums went down before it. The dead creepers
were torn from the rocks, and stretched out like
tattered flags on the rushing air. It leapt upon
the plain, licking up the dust like a huge wave
before it, and even as I fled it was upon us. It
was quite dark and the house pitched and groaned
like a laboring ship. Noise ! If you have never
heard the maniacal scream of wind, you have no
idea of what noise is; and this wind rolled all
others before it. The roar of the blast shrieking
down the valleys, the crashing of trees, and the
thin squeal of sand on the roof made us think
those great wings were beating us to death in
some gigantic struggle.
It could only have been moments counted on
one hand, when suddenly, as the blast com-
menced, it ceased, and the silence that followed
hurt physically. Then into the silence fell heavy
drops as of blood. One by one, heavier, quicker,
till with a rush the rain was upon us ' -t renzieci. y
a year-old puppy sought refuge in my arm, wm e
out in the paddocks we faintly heard the choke
cry of the raptured cattle. I cried that nignt or
the poor old dog that died before the rain.
CARO.
The Cat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YES,” said the woman with the
sombre eyes, “ I hate cats ! You
know (or perhaps you don't know) I
was going to marry a man once (What! Oh,
don’t be funny !) —and I didn’t.”
“Your husband?” I questioned. Where
does lie come in ? ”
She tore another strip off the palm-leaf fan
before she answered. (The click of the balls came
from the billiard-room, and the sound of a coarse
laugh floated up from the stahles.)
“Kenneth? I married Kenneth, there s a
difference between the man you marry and the
man you don't. The other man was what I had
always longed for,” she went on dreamily, and
for a time I—l—thought Heaven must have been
over-rated.
“Some people asked me once what being in
love was like. I told them I loved the night, be-
cause it brought him. And I loved the morning,
because it brought another night. I suppose they
thought I was mad. It was a sweet madness.
(She went.on tearing the fan in silence.)
“But about cats?” I reminded her. You
said you hated cats ! But why?”
She straightened her hack in a way I remem-
bortid •
“This is why,” she said, throwing away the
palm leaf as she spoke, with a sudden passionate
gesture. .
“There was a woman lived opposite to us who
seemed to have everything in the world but a
human interest. But —she had a cat. She
seemed to run after that cat. All day and half
the night—and the tragedy of it was that the brute
did not want her. I used to pity her, I who
thought 1 had so much !
“ Then he went away. ... I was sitting out
on the verandah one night, and Kenneth came.
I was thinking, and it bothered me to have him
there, so I sent him out on to the lawn to smoke.
“ After a time a special messenger came with a
letter. I tore upstairs to my room. ... You
know”—her voice trailed off drearily—“l said
I had thought I was so happy that Heaven . . .
Well, after I had read that letter, I thought the
other place could not he worse than reading a
letter like that. I looked in my glass when I
could —it seemed ages; but I suppose it was only
half an hour or so, and I knew that a good many
things were over for me—for ever. I wanted to
see what a woman looked like when she had lost
— everything!
“I was so cold, so awfully cold (it was a hot
night, too). I went down to the garden ; it was
very dark under the trees. In the house opposite
the lonely old woman was wandering round with
a candle and a saucer, calling the ciit. The light
from the candle fell on her long thin throat and
anxious face. It suddenly came to me : ‘Perhaps
the time will come when I, too, will have only—
only a cat to care for ! ’
“And then I ran— to Kenneth—under the
trees. ‘Where are you?’ I called. ‘Are you
still waiting ? ’ It was so dark, I fell into his
arms. ' . ,
“‘Yes,’ he said, holding me tightly— waiting
for you ! - God, am I to wait for ever ? ’
“‘No,’ I almost shrieked. ‘No!’...and
then—he kissed me .. .
* * * *
“ And over the road the woman was calling,
calling the cat.”
BOH.
The Jewels.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JEWELS a-glitter in radiance rare ;
Costly and fit for a queen to wear ;
Jewels set in a fair maid’s hair.
Bedded in blindness the earth below,
Cruelly torn from her peaceful breast,
For this is the covetous orb of woe
Where the glutted queen it among the rest.
And we are as lovely as sun-kissed snow.
Ours are the tints of the sedge-fringed meres
Aglow in the glory of evening skies,
Or of sunshine mirrored within the tears
That well to the fount of a fair maid’s eyes ;
That sweet with the bitter that scalds and sears.
We are as pure as a crystal spring ;
The palm which held us was foul and red
With the life of that blenched and tumbled thing
So sorely smitten ; so strangely dead ;
With a finger severed because of the ring.
We have led pride to the feet of shame ;
We have found virtue, and left it vice ;
We have been by when Frailty came
And bartered her body to Avarice.
Lo ! We are pure and are not to blame.
Yes, we are pure without flaw or speck,
Pure above purity, e’en because
The pure have exchanged at our royal beck
The woman that is for the woman that was ;
So we might gleam on her bare white neck.
For us the galleon tall aflame
With her bloodstained decks and her rifled hold,
The men’s black torture, the women’s shame,
And tales that the waves to the islands told
Of deeds encrimsoned, without a name.
The wild-beast orgies, the reek, the din,
The women’s sobs that the drink-songs drown,
The plank, and the flash of a cruel fin,
And the smothered shriek as a man goes down.
And we were the price that bought the sin.
Jewels a-glitter in radiance rare ;
Costly and mete for a queen to wear;
Set in the coils of a fair maid’s hair.
