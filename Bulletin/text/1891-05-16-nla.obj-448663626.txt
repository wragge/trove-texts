or other articles of leather by means of a sponge, attached
to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used h>
anyone without soiling the fingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar
Oil, Kalydor end Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20.

necessary to buy no Macassar Oil, Kalydor or Odonto

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research t horoughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods hr which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, tram
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladde
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment il
the water, accompanied by slight burning 01
smarting sensation. Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
bdOa.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
YOU S DElilLlT Y. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All
communications should be addressed

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Board of N.S. W. Late Boon Sur-
geon to the Great Northern Hospital. London
1 am aware that I am not atrictlv following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Phrenic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Nor.
6th 7th and Bth, 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater Importance, their health Is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, vis., Advertising.
It is utterly Impossible for those who are suffering
from these diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike n blow at the Quackery which now exists, but I alto add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
Mr Qualifications I Invite the fullest investigation into. For some time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of obsento t the many phases of the Nervous and
Svstem and to become accjuain ted. with fclie most scientific methods of effecting thelt cure. _ .
8 Mv solfauention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me he Is Informed at the
can effect Ms cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

SATURDAY, MAY 16, 1891.
Nullification.
The Bulletin, in discussing the results of
the Federal Conference held in Melbourne
in 1890, urged the Australias to “go slow’' in
their progress toward the goal of Federation.
In almost every reference that it has since
made to the problem this paper has repeated
the counsel. It repeats it again. Apart
from the personal vanity and unscrupulous-
ness of certain delegates to the late Conven-
tion, there is absolutely no earthly reason
why the educative process should not be
continued until that underlying sympathy
and that essential mutuality of interest, which,
quite apart from politicians and so-called
political ties, now identitiy the several
“colonies” as being distinctly one in
character and one in aspiration, expresses
itself in an unmistakable mandate to the Par-
liaments of the Provinces to establish a
Federal Government. No such mandate has
yet been issued by the people of any single
province. The delegation to the Federal
Convention was in no sense a popular one
in, or with respect to, any one province, and,
in at least three of the most important
“ colonies,” was the product of iniquitous
cabals. The petty tricks with which certain
hucksters of political wares purchased their
seats in the Convention have, in these
“ colonies,” not been ratified by the popular
voice or conscience. Neither have the
people of other “colonies ” declared them-
selves definitely in favour of the Federal
principle. The question has never been
made a test at any general election ; it has
not been granted a supreme position in any
Ministerial programme ; in no case have the
electors of any province had the opportunity
to declare for or against Federation.
* '* *
The assertion that the Draft Constitution
Bill will be the creation of the people of
Australia, in the event of its adoption
by a number of Parliaments, would thus
be the idlest nonsense were it not of
the most mischievous tendency. In every
country and in every age, Authority
has been created by a class or classes by
clothing large and unjustifiable pretensions
with the sanctities of constitutional procedure,
and a congeries of democratic countries here
are not better protected from the danger of
having their liberties whittled away by such
delusiv o steps than are oligarchically-ruled
nations. In the former, as in the latter,
“ ther pried of liberty is eternal vigilance,”
and in the former, as in the latter, the con-
sciousness of the people, sent to slumber by
the assurance that their interests are safe in
the hands of their constitutionally-appointed
i epi esentatives, may but have been drugged
to its own death. More treasons against the
commonweal in England have been per-
petrated with the sanction of constitutional
toims than were over perpetrated in defiance
of them. Our would-be masters here have
not failed to learn the lesson. The one way
to show them that they have learnt it in
vain is for Australia to declare that, in this
matter of Federation, it is not going to be
hurried, but that it intends to 11 go slow.”
Tim declaration may hurt some politicians’
feelings, but it may be called for the more
urgently for that very reason.
# # #
The Australias should proceed slowly if
they wish to proceed surely. “ The Federal
Union,” says Paekes, “is a wedding of
States, and the experience of the world of
politics no more than that of the world of
domesticity fails to encourage indulgence
in the belief that a hasty marriage will not
be followed by a leisured repentance. The
marriage will be attended by more auspicious
auguries when it is preceded by the fullest
discussion of the new responsibilities and
by education for the new duties which will be
obligated upon its consummation. “If
there is to be no ultimate separation, let the
steps towards union be well and carefully
measured,” is surely an expression of the
commonest prudence. It is an unfortunate
accident of the situation that it is not also
an expression of our highest “ colonial ”
statesmanship. The leading “ Statesmen ”
of the several States are, with such gifts of
gab and lung as lies within them, urging an
immediate union. But tlm circumstance
that they are going in bald-headed into
the business is precisely why the several
peoples should refuse to go in blindfolded.
The Australian intellect is seldom doing
better work than when it is distrusting the
politicians.
* * *
If the judgment of our “statesmen” as
declared in the “Draft of a Bill to Consti-
tute the Commonwealth of Australia ” be
accepted, tacitly or directly, by the people of
the several provinces, then will the Aus-
tralias be committed to a Federal Union that
must, inevitably, sooner or later, be
violently ruptured. The Federal Union, if
constituted, should be regarded as indis-
soluble. From the moment the States
enter into the compact to erect a Federal
Government, should date an immortal
vitality. New interests will be then created
which ought to be as lasting as any human
institution ; new commercial, social and
political relations will be established which,
humanly speaking, should be perpetual. But
is this immortal structure to be built hastily,
without the fullest possible gauging of
the future, without calling to the aid of
the builders that subtle instinct of the
mass, that “ common sense of most,” that
popular sanction, without which no political
institution can stand ? The politicians say
Yes ; the laws of permanence say u No ”
emphatically “No !” The Constitution of
the Lnited States of America was the pro-
duct not alone of a few weeks’ deliberations,
but of ten years’ experience of a loose con-
federacy. It was, as framed, the most magni-
ficent monument of political wisdom then ex-
tant, yet it was not perfect, for it distinctly
evaded, and carefully excluded from sight, a
difficulty that was even then more moral
than political. W hat was the result ?
Because of that evasion, distinctly and
designedly made, within a century the Union
had to fight for its existence and to drench
its ai eas with blood. Now, if without any
previous experience of confederacy, without
the same informative and educative exigency
of circumstance which infused the Fathers of
the American Union, without the material
pressure of the British bayonet-tips, which,
though peace had been declared, were still
palpable to the American sight, without
cither the like purity of patriotism or the
like degree of proved political intelligence ;
if without these things, but with like diffi-
culties, of a nature at once moral and political,
facingthem with only a desire to evade them, our
Conventionists produce a measure that is
neither as consistent with itself nor as lumi-
nous in its insight as the American, what
then? Can w T e, in Australia, hope to escape
the visitation of civil war, of rebellion, of
the bloody coercion by the more populous
and financially powerful States of the less-
populated and weaker ones ? If every
confederacy known to history, from the
Achrean and Uycian Leagues to the Ameri-
can, the Swiss, and the Canadian, has had to
threaten if not to exert the force of the cen-
tral or the major power upon the individual
States, it is insane for the Australian people
to refuse to believe in the possibility of a
rupture of the union. And, in the nature of
the case, the process of disunion—the seces-
sion of a State or States from the whole-
can never be a peaceable operation. When
a State proceeds to nullify an act of the Federal
Power, the nullification will mean war.
* * *
The Draft Constitution forbids nullifica-
tion. Wo have already, in those columns,
pointed out that chapter V., clause 0 :
" hen a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the
Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former
shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid ;
embodies an insidious attack on State-rights.
In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred°this
clause will operate without any particular
injustice to the individual States, for in those
instances the point of “ inconsistency ” will
almost assuredly be of a nature in which
the matter involved is of a peculiarly
Australian importance as distinguished
from a merely State concern, and one
in which the good sense of the State’s
people will thus keep step with Australian
opinion. But in the hundredth case, say,
the dispute will turn upon a question which
both the Central Government and the State
will regard as essential and vital—the former
with relation to the interests of Australia as
a whole, the latter with respect to its effect
upon its own citizens. Which shall then
prevail—the Commonwealth or the State ?
Obviously the Constitutionalist will be com-
pelled to reply: “The Commonwealth.”
Equally obvious is it that the thick-and-thin
advocates of State Sovereignty and State
Rights will answer; “The State.” And
what then ? Coercion more or less dis-
guised—which it will require more con-
summate statesmanship than the Australian
politician, as we know him to-day, possesses,
to prevent developing into war. Peaceable
secession will be impossible, because, even
if secession be permissible on an equitable
adjuscmentof responsibilities entered into on
a State’s behalf by the Central Government, a
cool and rational settlement could not be
arrived at in the excited condition of feeling
which would necessarily be consequent upon
any conflict of the Federal and Provincial
powers. The State would feel oppressed
and would resent what it deemed to be an
a f?g ress ion j the Federal Executive would
have no option but to enforce the law by the
military arm. Is such a hundredth case im-
possible ? Let us state a hypothetical
difficulty which will only require the assumed
conditions, which must arise, to transform
the hypothesis into fact. It is only a ques-
tion of decades, perhaps of years, for
Northern Queensland to be erected into a
separate colony. Ask any North Queens-
lander, one who knows the country and
knows the forces at work or lying dormant
within it, and he will tell you that a
Northern Queensland legislature will enact
laws providing for the introduction of
coloured labour. Now, a Federal Govern-
ment dominated by the States in which the
agricultural, industrial and pastoral condi-
tions can be fed always and in every way by
white labour, will never legalise any such
measure. Here, then, we would have at
once a casus belli. Complicate the situa-
tion by establishing what must come, a
separate State in what is now called the
Northern Territory of South Australia, and
a third, and perhaps a fourth, State
in the tropical portions of Western
Australia, and there will be created
throughout those Northern States a
community of feeling and an identity of
interest diametrically opposed to the moral
sense and the political notiousof the Southern
States of the Union. We should have a
Mason and Dixey line in Australia, with its
inevitable resultants : the declaration by the
Federal Parliament that the States’ coloured
labour laws were “inconsistentthe passing
by the States’ legislature of acts rendering
“null and void” within their respective
boundaries the anti-coloured-labour acts of
the Federal Parliament ; secession ; con-
federacy between the North ; and between
the North and South—war. And—let this
be marked well —war in which the advantage
at the start will be with the Federal
Government, as the Draft Constitution
destroys the militia power of each State.
* * #
Conventionists of the Parkes - Munro
brand—the imbecilities of the Convention—
will dismiss this picture with a breath. From
Griffith we expect better things, and we
want to know what he says to it. He, of all
men, is aware that there is no falsity in the
perspective. He cannot fail to apprehend
that the North Queenslander, in defying the
power of the Federal Government, will
believe he is protecting, not alone the inter-
ests of his own pocket, but his dearest
liberty—the right to rule in those affairs that
concern himself. What does Griffith say ?
What doeslNGLis Clark, of Tasmania, say to
this t That in the conflict the Constitution
must prevail—that is what they will say. But
what will have become of the liberties of the
citizen of Northern Queensland which they
now declare are conserved under the Con-
stitution ? To deny the powers of nullifica-
tion to the individual States is to invite
secession and civil war ; to grant it, is to
render, on our hypothesis (which must
arrive), permanent union impossible. There
is a dilemma, but it is not of our making— at
is the creation of the Constitution-moulders.
And yet, to the present time, not a word
has been dropped by any Conventionist
that would indicate he has any sense of the
danger, the measureless danger, which lurks
within the clause we have quoted. There is
one way to avoid the danger. Crush the
dilemma. That can be done by informing
every elector of the Australias what he has
to expect when he casts his vote for the Con-
stitution. If he, voluntarily and consciously
realising the possibilities, abandons his nul-
lifying power, well and good—he acts within
his right and exercises his right. But let
him not be trapped by an insidiously-worded
clause into assenting to a Constitution which
deprives him of a liberty he now enjoys-
the right to legislate for his dearest interests.
What in the case supposed (which we have
purposely taken because The Bulletin’s
sympathies would be with respect to it on
the side of the Constitution) would be the
position of the North Queenslander —may, iu
other cases, be that of the citizen of every
other State. With that possibility before
the Australias, let them “go slow.”

“ The Southern States,” said Rufus
King, of Massachusetts, one of the
ablest, most temperate, and keenest-
sighted members of the Philadelphia Con-
vention of 1787, “ threaten to separate now
(from the Confederacy) in case injury should
be done them. There will be no point of
time at which they will not be able to say :
‘Do us Justice or we will separate. ’ ” King,
next to Franklin, the cleverest mouthpiece
of the most potent Northern States, placated
the Southern feeling, which even then was
prophetic of civil disaster, by these words.
But because the man who used them, and
his colleagues who applauded them, shut
their eyes to plain facts, such a noint of time
did arise. The Southern States, in 1861,
demanded what they regarded as justice.
With the exception of Bright, there was
scarcely a prominent Englishman who did
not conceive they rightly made the claim ;
yet it was refused, and they separated. The
world knows the issue. Let us, here in
Australia, not refuse to perceive the signifi-
cance of the way in which history falsified
King’s noteworthy assertion. Let us take a
full, steady view of facts and possibilities.
A Brutal Nation.
A few months ago the Pall Mall Gazette
started an enquiry under this heading, “ Are we
a Brutal Nation?” and after much investigation
and considerable raking up of mouldered
precedents and ancient information, it
resolved the question in the affirmative. Its
opinion was based on a long list of horrors—on
murders and premeditated homicides, and
sudden deaths—on that state of savagery which
relieves its overcharged soul by drunkenness
and wife-beating, and brutal assault—on that
strange, unfathomed instinct which leads the
lower-class Englishman to heave a half brick at
any stranger who comes in his way, and then to
kick him on the head—on prize-fighting, dog-
fighting, cock-fighting, horse-racing, pigeon-
shooting, hunting, and similar sports, and many
other evidences of a like nature. It considered
that joyous sentiment deeply rooted in the
soul of the cultured Briton, which makes him
find his chief pleasure and satisfaction in going
out with a gun and killing something—anything,
everything—he is not particular what it is so
long as he can make some miserable animal die
in torment ere giving it away; and which
enables him to snatch a fearful joy out of the
agonies of some wretched quadruped that is
being eaten alive by his dogs after being hunted
into the last stage of exhaustion. It pointed
out how the Anglo-Saxon cheerfully planks
down his last cent to see two illiterate char-
acters bang each other’s heads into an unplea-
sant mash, like a clubbed reptile ; and in view
of these and many similar characteristics which
mark that cultured islander wherever he goes,
it returned a verdict that the Briton in all his
home and foreign varieties is a brute. Probably
the verdict was correct, and yet the enquiry
hardly touched the beginning of the great
question, and it altogether omitted the most
reliable evidence of all. The Briton is brutal,
and coarse, and unfeeling in many respects, but
he is brutal chiefly in his utter inability to
understand his own deficiences. He has a
criminal code which is about as humane as the
average, but his administration of it is appalling
in its infamous pigheadedness, and callous, un~
feeling stupidity; and the difficulty seems to be
past remedy, for he is as incapable of learning
how to use his code in a reasonably sane fashion
as a hog is of learning how to use a telescope.
The telescope may be a fine instrument, but
with nothing but a hog to put at the end of it
it is useless. And the Anglo-Saxon criminal
law is useless for exactly the same reason—
there is a hog at the end of it also.
* # #
When a case of revolting cruelty is brought
before the law in any part of the British
Empire the hopeless inability of the Briton to
understand even the meaning of cruelty becomes
apparent. In Melbourne, a few days ago, a
free and enlightened citizen named Killin went
home and jumped on his wife with such vigour
that she only missed death by a hair’s-breadth,
and whether she will ever fully recover is a
matter of doubt. When he was interrupted in
his joyous performance his house resembled a
shambles and it was with difficulty that sundry
meddlesome and interfering inhabitants dragged
out the unrecognisable mass of blood and hair
and mangled humanity on top of which Killin
was bounding and gambolling. On this occa-
sion the law woke up with unwonted vigour
and energy, and the language of the Bench was
stronger than an elephant and louder than the
blast of the last trumpet. It heaved hair-
raising, soul-scorching expressions at Killin,
and hurled the whole dictionary of vituperation
at that degraded object; and rained denuncia-
tions upon him ; and then just when it seemed
that he was about to get years of penal servi-
tude, it climbed to the topmost pinnacle of
wrath and came crashing down with a sentence
of seven days’ imprisonment. The reason
assigned for this proceeding was that Killin' ’s
wife and children would have been left in want
had he been shut up for a longer period ; yet if
that offensive wretch had stolen ten shillings he
would have been duly committed for trial, and
would have spent several months in gaol as a
preliminary, and the law would have solemnly
informed him that his wife and children could
not be taken into consideration, and then,
instead of giving way to boiling-hot indignation
and seven days, it would have sent him to gaol
calmly and dispassionately for eighteen months
ov more. It is an essential part of the
inbred brutality of the Anglo-Saxon race
that it cannot even begin to realise the
meaning of cruelty. It is utterly incapable of
comprehending that it is a worse outrage to
maim and batter and disfigure a human being
than to steal 10s.—the fact is as far from it as
a hog is from the stars. And even though the
value of humanity, as compared to that of mere
property, were preached and taught and'ex-
pounded in every possible way with years of
ceaseless iteration, the result would be just the
same—the information is as hopelessly wasted
as if it were fired into the interior of a boiler,
for the magistrate and the boiler are equally
incapable of appreciating it.
* # #
This spirit of unconscious brutality accom-
panies the Briton to all parts of the earth.
England tne other day a “lady” named
Brown was convicted of a series of horrible
assaults on her pauper servant-girl, which ended


in the child’s death—in other words, she was
flogged to death in a slow, lingering way for
BboVn’s amusement, and that “lady” was
sentenced to six months’ hard labour. And, as
usual, the Court informed Brown that she was
a wretch who was unfit to live and not good
enough to die, and apparently it was firmly
convinced that it was wreaking a horrible
revenge on Brown, and coming down on that
alleged female with revolting severity. Yet,
two days later, a hawker who stole a halfpenny
was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprison-
ment, and in this case the Law was not aggra-
vated, as in the previous instance—it was in a
gentle and contemplative mood, and was rather
inclined to be humane than otherwise. Conse-
quently, it takes three murdered servant-girls to
make one halfpenny, even when a British Judge
is raving mad about the servant-girl and mild
and unbiased about the halfpenny; if the
position had been reversed, and the Judge had
bee'n in a wild frenzy over the halfpenny and in
a coldly-critical mood concerning the servant-
girl, it would probably have taken twenty-four
instead of three. The case of another woman
who shoved a red-hot poker into a child’s
mouth came up for consideration when the
British code was in one of its calmer moments,
and the sentence was,“ seven days,” on account
of the ‘ ‘ delicate condition of the prisoner’s
health and being refreshed by this incident,
the Law rose up and awarded five years’ penal
servitude to an individual who stole £2 25., and
nine months to another individual who killed
his wife with a poker. If this latter person
had destroyed a whole harem with the poker
he would probably have been allowed a reduc-
tion on murdering a quantity, but this point
was not sufficiently elucidated.
# * *
The species of insanity which administers jus-
tice in this manner excites little comment, for
in all Britain and North America and Australia
—in all the Anglo-Saxon world, in fact—there
is hardly one Judge or magistrate or other
judicial authority who knows any better. The
trail of the old Saxon brutality is over the
whole population, so that the savagery of
the law passes unobserved. The individual
who is convicted for the third or fourth time of
stealing a few shillings, and whose total
plunderings amount, perhaps, to £2 10s., spends
the best years of his life in confinement, and
the seasons pass, and the years come and go,
and find him still monotonously pounding rocks
or picking oakum, till old age comes upon him
and he is discharged, a useless, broken-down
wreck of no account. And even then his
punishment is only half done, for there is no
rest for him on this side of the grave. If he
tries to find honest employment, for want of
which he was driven to a paltry crime, he is
haunted by the clumsy, ignorant, and stony-
souled detective, who informs every possible
employer of his past misdeeds, and makes
reformation absolutely impossible. If he fails
to find employment—which he necessarily
does—he is arrested for “ vagrancy,” and
receives a fresh sentence of twelve months as a
hardened offender who is “well known to the
police,” and when his term expires the same old
experience begins over, again. If he is seen
anywhere he is arrested and sent to gaol on a
charge of “ being a suspected person frequent-
ing a public place for the purpose of committing
a felony,” and if he is not seen anywhere it is
presumed that he has quitted the district; and
information concerning him is sent to the adja-
cent provinces, so that he may be “moved on ”
if he stops, on the assumption that he has
stopped for a sinful purpose, and stopped if
he moves on under another assumption that
he is moving on for the purpose of
committing some fresh injury to property. And
if he cannot be sufficiently crushed by any or
all of these devices, he can always be reached
on the elastic charge of “having property in
his possession which is reasonably supposed to
be stolen j” and, in short, from the moment of
his first conviction to the last breath of his
miserable existence he is a slave of the most ab-
ject description, and his rights as a human
being are extinguished. It is not even neces-
sary to prove any crime against him ; he can
always be imprisoned on a mere charge of being
a “ suspected person,” and he can be suspected
as often as the most dunderheaded policeman in
existence chooses to suspect him.
* * #
But all this applies to offences against
Property only. The individual, who is
charged with pounding his wretched wife, or
some unoffending stranger, for the eighteenth
time, is fined the same invariable 40s.
or fourteen days, with which he started his
nefarious career, and in his case the cumulative
penalty falls through entirely. He is subjected
to no police surveillance, nor is he systema-
tically ruined and impoverished by the interfer-
ence of the “ force.” He is never arrested on a
charge of ‘ ‘ being reasonably suspected of
having assaulted some person or persons un-
known,” or sent to gaol on a general accusation
°t “being in a public place with intent to
commit a ferocious outrage.” The same blood-
thirsty spirit [(which leads the whole Anglo-
> axon race to put up its money for the pleasure
I see ing two low-grade animals batter and
each other into a muddy and offensive
squash causes it to sympathise with this offen-
ce object. He is a species of informal prize-
ghting exhibition without the gate-money, and
J 16 Pounds or disfigures a woman or a child
** ol ' a full-grown male antagonist, he is
t regarded with a sort of tacit sympathy as
' n artist who is engaged in an inferior branch
lie great science of brutality. The charge
0 sympathising with such an individual would,
0 doubt, be repudiated with boundless indig-
pV? 1 } by every administrator of the law in the
r .. ls h Empire, but the case is one in which
Tff lollB s P ea k m °re plainly than words. The
1 erence between a fine of 40s. and a term of
gi een m'onths’ hard labour sufficiently ex-
{. the feeling of the brutal law 7 -distributor
1 a .. fbe brutal law-breaker is more or less his
oiv i ler ’ as distinguished from the hunger-
Mcken thief who is not his brother in any
t f e whatever. The average Judge or magis-
n , c applies the criminal code—not for the
i ( . 10n °f the nation, but for his own nro-
..i, 1011 ’ an d for that purpose alone. It is
om that he is himself knocked down and
kicked by some brutal rowdy, for he usually
lives in a fashionable suburb where police pro-
tection is abundant, and where the rowdy is
scarce ; and therefore he looks upon the latter
merely as an individual who injures people in
whom he has little interest; but he descends
like an avalanche on the thief for the better
protection of his own hereditary spoons and
forks. And unless a very large number of
Judges and magistrates are violently assaulted
and much damaged it is not likely that the
judicial intelligence will ever awake to a sense
of its own stupendous, time-encrusted idiocy.
# # *
There are one or two exceptions to this great
law of brutality, but they are rather apparent
than real. The garotter is struck with the
biggest sledge-hammer in the legal armoury,
but he is sentenced to a long term of imprison-
ment and a long course of able and vigorous
floggings, not so much because he partially
strangled his victim and then trod on his head,
as by reason of the eighteenpence which he
removed from his pocket after he became insen-
sible. Moreover, the garotter plies his vocation
indiscriminately about the streets, and conse-
quently he is as liable to choke a Judge or a
politician or an archbishop as any other citizen,
and for these reasons the law descends upon
him with all that unobtrusive vigour which it
manifests when either property or the owners
of property are in danger. When this much-
harried offender stays at home and merely
garrottes his own relatives—these being persons
of no political influence, who can be damaged
without striking a blow at any “vested in-
terest ” —the ancient forty-shilling fine fully
meets his case. And in addition to the garrotter
the law falls with tremendous vigour on the in-
dividual who uses a revolver or a knife, even
when he only inflicts a trivial injury in
self-defence, and compared with the individual
who staves in a peaceful stranger or relative
with his fists and his feet, his situation is a bad
one. The reason of this is not very clearly
defined. Most probably, however, fears are
entertained that he might shoot a passing
capitalist by accident, and moreover, his con-
duct is contrai'y to the grand old prize-fighting
instincts of the Anglo-Saxon race. The same
craving which leads the cultured Briton to pay
for the privilege of seeing two men pound each
other till both are practically featureless finds
balm for its soul when somebody is hideously
mashed in a public house row ; but if the defen-
dant cuts the proceedings short, and thereby
defrauds and aggravates the spectators, he
touches the British race on a sensitive point.
The English-speaking nations in all parts of the
world feel towards such an individual much as
the Roman populace would have felt towards,
the person who stunned the tiger with a fence-
rail just as it was about to tear the first mouth-
ful off a promising live deacon, and, therefore,
the criminal code visits him with ponderous
ferocity. Probably the criminal code doesn’t
stop to analyse its own emotions, but that
makes no difference in the result.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The “Ant” Libel Case.
The libel action between an aggravated police-
man and the Melbourne Ant, in Avhich the
defendant newspaper Avas ordered to pay £lOO
damages in order to soothe the feelings of the
injured constable, casts an altogether neAV light
on the position of the press in Australia. The
circumstances out of Avhich the case arose were
somewhat surprising—or rather they would be
surprising if they were not of such exceedingly
frequent occurrence. One day, some months
ago, the constable in question dragged, carried,
humped, or otherAvise propelled a helpless and
insensible individual named Gange to the
police-station, and the customary charge of
“ drunk ” having been entered against him he
was deposited in a cell and left there. After
12 hours, however, it Avas discovered that he
Avasn’t drunk but suffering from fearful injuries
to the head, and about four hours later he died.
Possibly he might have died in any case;
possibly he might have recovered if he had
received immediate attention, mayhap Avas
killed by the long period of neglect to which he
was exposed ; on this point there seems to have
been no reliable evidence. When the medical
examination Avas made 13 hours had elapsed
since Gange’s arrest, and as the doctor’s were
of opinion that his wounds Avere from 12 to 15
hours old it naturally folloAved, either that the
policeman had arrested a dying man in mistake
for a drunk, and that neither he nor any other
official concerned in the case could tell the
difference, or else that he had arrested a com-
mon, ordinary inebriate, and that the injuries
were somehow inflicted while Gangs was in
custody. And here a surprising discrepancy
comes in. The Ant took the former
vieAA 7 , and railed at the officer on a
charge of general stupidity and incapa-
city, yet the officer’s . evidence consisted
chiefly of an impassioned delaration that he had
not battered, assaulted, or ill-used the deceased,
and as the defendants laid no such offence to
his charge this statement —though it must
arouse sympathy—seems to have absolutely no
bearing on the case. This point being disposed
of, there remained only the original accusation
that the officer arrested a badly-injured man in
mistake for an inebriate, and as Judge
in his summing up, declared that the plaintiff
had acted “in a most proper manner” the
damages appear to have been given on the
ground that such a blunder was rather com-
mendable than otherwise. No evidence was
produced to show that anybody except the
constable was to blame in the matter, and as
the court decided that the constable Avas not
to blame it naturally follows that nobody Avas
responsible. It also folloAvs that the death of a
common human being under such circumstances
is not a subject Avhich a neAvspaper can comment
upon Aviih impunity, or at all events it must not
use strong language about it, but should look at
in a quiet, indifferent, unimpassioned manner as
if it was a drainage item or a question of
paving. And the evident moral is, that a news-
paper should not give Avay to excitement about
anything that doesn’t pay, and that the libt?
law is badly in want of closer definition. For
apparently the only thing that the defendants
could have lawfully asserted in such a case was
that Gange was dead, and as everybody knew
that fact it wasn’t worth mentioning.
A “ British Seaman."
At Hobart (Tas.) the other day, half-a-dozen
seamen belonging to a barque then lying in the
harbour struck work and went ashore, contrary
to the orders of the monarch on the quarter-
deck, and, being promptly arrested, they were
sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment apiece.
There was nothing surprising or unusual about
this proceeding ; such events in the free land of
Australia arc more common than mud or cock-
roaches or unwholesome liquor, and it is a mere
matter of course that the seaman should be
regarded by the law as something about half-
way between a horse and a convicted felon.
Yet there is absolutely no more reason that the
mariner who knocks off work while in harbour
should be sent to gaol than that Parkes should
get 28 days’ hard labour for not turning up at
his office in the morning, or that any other
politician should be seized by a policeman, and
dragged through the gutters, and knocked up
against house corners, and bumped against
lamp-posts, and finally landed in a bruised and
dishevelled condition at the lock-up because he
failed to be in his place when the House met.
In fact, there is much more reason for arresting
the politician than the seaman, for the latter
draws his pay only when he is working, while
the former is paid whether he works or not, and
even a Chinese intellect can appreciate the
glaring injustice of a system by which one man
has his pay stopped and is sent to gaol
as well, while the other man commits
precisely the same offence without any
results at all. The seaman, in fact, is
one of the anomalies of civilisation. He is a
miserably-paid individual, who lives in a heav-
ing dog-kennel, and works long hours in fine
weather, while in bad weather he works inces-
santly, and subsists on horrible victuals, and
leads an existence as precarious as that of a
man who lives by falling over precipices, and
while at sea he is practically the slave and hard-
driven nigger of an autocrat who is beyond law
and out of the reach of justice. The last con-
dition is supposed to be necessary for the safety
of his vessel, but this theory falls through, for
even in harbour he is sent to gaol if he “ refuses
to obey orders,” or if he quits his vessel leaving
his wages behind him; and if he goes on shore
to lodge a complaint against a brutal officer, fie
is generally run in for being absent without
leave ; and yet the nation which regards these
things as a matter of course would rend the
heavens with its shriek of indignation if the
P.M. who tries the case were kicked into a
mouldy dungeon when he is “ absent without
leave,” or if some Civil Service official were
hauled away by the collar and the hair because
he left the office at lunch-time and neglected to
come back. The seaman, however, seldom has
a vote, and the foreign seaman, w’ho drops in
casually at an Australian port, and is punctually
gaoled for trying to get ashore to look for
justice, never has one ; and in this fact
lies the secret of his misfortunes. No poli-
tician cares one solitary cent about a man
who has no vote and no political weight. No
judge or magistrate cares a cent about him
either, for it is a dead certainty that no one
will take up his case in Parliament, and there-
fore any bald and unsupported assertion of an
officer is sufficient, in most cases, to outweigh
the evidence of an entire crew. No lawyer
cares about him, for he has seldom any money
to pay a lawyer, and an unpaid lawyer doesn’t
care even about an archangel. No consul cares
about him, for sailors are the principal bane and
trouble of a consul’s existence —in short, nobody
cares except a disinterested Christian, and there
fs only one disinterested Christian to every
thousand square leagues of the earth’s surface,
and when that rare individual is found he
has no money and no influence, and can’t do
anything, and labours under the suspicion of
being a lunatic. And therefore the seamen’s
position, taking it all round, is not a thing that
even a dog could afford to envy.

1“ Putting 1 Down ” Homicide.
The Victorian assassination boom still keeps
moving, and the Judges keep on passing
sentences and preaching solemn homilies, and
the hangman keeps on hanging, all just as
before. There is a woeful sameness about the
sentences and the hangings, but the solemn
preachments of the Bench are, perhaps, about
the most monotonous of all. The following is
a slab from the report of a recent trial at Sale,
on which occasion the Court delivered itself of
these memorable words :
In these days the colonies appear to be passing
through an epidemic of murders and manslaughters, so
that to-day human life is less regarded than at any other
time within my memory. It is absolutely essential that
this state of things should be put down.
It is only the same old flail pounding the same
old straw that has been pounded through all the
ages. Every man who is furnished with under-
standing knows that an effect cannot be ‘ ‘ put
down” unless the cause is also extinguished,
and as yet nobody really know 7 s and hardly any-
body cares to ask what is the cause of homi-
cide. It is not, as a rule, a matter of profit; in
most cases it pays not a single cent in the way
of dividend, and is one glaring, conspicuous loss
from first to last. In this respect it resembles
w 7 ar, which is ruin to the nation which wins
and still greater ruin to the nation that does not
win, and so long as war exists it is quite
evident that man will play at a game where
there is nothing to be gained and everything to
be lost. If murder can be “ put down,” then
war can be put down likewise, for in
each case it is only necessary to convince
anybody of the insanity of being killed
for no visible purpose. To extinguish war,
however, is much the easier undertaking of the
two, for all that is necessary to produce a
murder is that the nation should grow one
solitary individual who is sufficiently wanting
in intelligence to make an exhibition of himself
at the end of.a greased rope when there is no
profit in the transaction, while a war conducted
on modern principles requires 50,000 such
lunatics at the very least. It would take
28,000 hangings to do as much in the way of
eradicating this species of derangement as was
done on the single battlefield of Gravelotte, and
as Gravelotte did nothing whatever to lessen
the unaccountable tendency of mankind to go
out and be killed gratis, it is obvious that even
28,000 hangings are a very small and ineffectual
thing indeed. Under such conditions as these
a Judge only makes himself an object of public
derision when he puts on frills over one hanging
as a means of putting down anything, for ex-
perience has long since proved either that hang-
ing is no more the way to put down murder
than gunshot is to put down war, or else that it
wants more hanging or more gunshot than the
world has ever yet seen to make the slightest
impression on either disease. Moreover, the
man who undertakes to eradicate homicide by
execution is obviously beginning at the wrong
end. The first step should betoput down common
assault, for homicide in most cases is merely an
assault in which one party has hit rather harder
than usual. And common assault belongs to
the same class of grievances as Parliamentary
opposition, religious controversy, prize-fighting,
boxing, scientific disputes, riot, insurrection,
and argument generally, for they are all signs
and evidences of a combative instinct, which is
in itself unaccountable and which cannot be ex-
tinguished simply because of its unaccountable-
ness. Also strikes, -party processions, shooting,
clerical reform, horse-racing, patriotism, and
dog-fights, are all more or less dependent on
the same principle, and unless they can all be
wiped out homicide will still remain in exist-
ence. Therefore, the Judge who resolves to ‘ ‘ put
down ” manslaughter has undertaken the largest,
widest, and most comprehensive contract on
record, and has cheerfully entered on a job at
which a million archangels might break their
backs without making the first beginnings of an
impression. And, strangely enough, there was
no shriek of uncontrollable laughter when he
made his great announcement. The audience
heard this undersized fly declare his intention
of removing a ton of bricks at one lift and never
moved a muscle.
Baron Hirsch, who denies that he offered
£3,000,000 for the relief of the persecuted
Russian Jews, has apparently stopped Tummy’s
supplies, and that worthy, fearing to ask Par-
liament for pecuniary help, has fallen back on
“Ma,” who, out of her store (said to be 13
millions), intends to wipe off his liabilities. A
Sydney paper puts down Walks’ income at
£50,000, including the allowance of £lO,OOO to
his wife, but that is a long way under the mark.
For instance, he receives £16,210 15s. annually
as a perpetual pension from the Duchy of Corn-
wall for ‘ ! the loss of duty on the coinage of tin and
in lieu of ” —we smile—“ post groats and white
rents.” Then, again, he lias another small per-
petual pension from Cornwall for the loss of
“ prisage and butlerage on wine” imported
through that country. Furthermore, the average
net returns to his coffers per year from the
Duchy since 1864 have been £61,232. In addi-
tion to these enormous sums he draws salaries as
Field Marshal, as Colonel of the Tenth Hussars
(£1350), and sums from various other military
positions wdiich he holds. His travelling ex-
penses, when his movements can by any means
be put down as State ones, are charged to the
country, as are the repairs of Marlborough
House, wdiich average £5OOO yearly. It may
be forgotten that on Wales coming of age and
getting married he received a grant of £23,455,
and from the Duchy of Cornwall the accumula-
tions of his minority, £572,075 in the Funds and
£29,646 in the Bank. Poor pauper !
—-♦
Ex-Parson Cullen, who represents North
Sydney in the N. S. W. Assembly, was last week
fatuous enough to publicly disparage Grey in
favour of Parkes. ‘‘ If they only knew the
two men they would find Sir Henry Parkes a
truer Democrat than Sir George Grey.” Now,
Cullen doesn’t know Grey —he only knows his
lord and master and godfather, Parkes.
Cullen says that Grey “ lacks sagacity.” He
should have said that Grey lacks hypocrisy.
“Parkes is in reality a truer friend of One-
Man-One-Vote than Grey, for he has embodied
it in a Bill which they are about to pass.” Now-,
Grey has embodied it in a Bill which has
passed, notwithstanding that he submitted it
merely as a private member. “As a leader,
Parkes is immeasurably superior to Grey.”
As a party leader, perhaps. Grey was born,
however, not to lead a party, but to lead a nation.
From the manner in which Cullen attacked
Grey and glorified Parkes it can easily be seen
that the latter is cut to the quick by Grey’s
magnificent and unexampled reception in Aus-
tralia, where he is now the god of the Demo-
cracy. His action in agitating for One-Man-
One-Vote as the bedrock of the Federal Consti-
tution, and standing almost alone in so doing,
has secured for him that picturesque place in
Australian history which the shifty Parkes
would fain have occupied.

Jock Nimmo is Held to have been ignorant of
the fact that he applied for 500 new 7 shares in
the Premier Building Association, instead of 100
shares. And although he pocketed interest on
500 half-crown deposits, and not on 100, a
learned Judge has decided that Nimmo was too
utterly devoid of business capacity to know
what he w r as doing, or why he did it. Being so
uncommonly soft-headed, perhaps Nimmo
doesn’t yet understand that he still draws £6
per week as a member of Parliament, and used
for some years to draw a plump salary for
“managing” a ministerial department. Who
was it that said—“ Go forth, my son, and see
with how little wisdom the world is governed ” ?
By the w'ay, they say that even Nimmo requires
a change of scene, and when he clears out there
will be only Dow left to meet that £175,000 for
which the P.B.A. directors are alleged to be
jointly and severally liable “under the Act.”
There’s no getting away from the Act except by
mail steamer, apparently. Lumsden slunk
away before the trials began ; Gourlav and his
friend, Murphy, are enjoying themselves in
Europe ; Ferguson and .Stewart were not to
be found the last time they w'ere enquired for ;
and Jock Nimmo will have to travel for the
benefit of his health. Not that it can make
much pecuniary difference to the poor old man,
whether he goes or stays. It was the other
fellows who got hold of the half millions at a
time.


In Queensland now, if two men meet and fight
anywhere or under any circumstances what-
ever, it transpires afterwards in the daily
papers that the man who was knocked over
was a “free labourer,” while the man who
knocked him over was a unionist. This kind of
assault arid battery is getting so monotonous that
wo are moved to inquire why somebody
doesn’t infuse some variety into the matter. Is
wery blackleg so thin and helpless and gone at
the knees that he falls down when he and a
unionist start hitting each other? or do the
papers simply call the man who is on top a
unionist, from sheer force of habit; or are
the assaults mostly bogus? As matters
stand at present it would seem that, however
big and brawny the blackleg may be, and how-
ever small and old the unionist, the former
simply sits down on the pavement and weeps
when he sees the latter coming, and allows
himself to be walloped without resistance, and
naturally this circumstance looks improbable
as well as monotonous. Moreover, the non-
union shearer appears to turn up in the most
unlikely places, and everybody who is assaulted
or injured up North seems to be he. About a
week ago, for instance, a rowdy crowd looted
a pub. on the Warrego, and according to report
they emptied out the liquor and tied up the
landlord’s family to, a log by the wayside.
There ' was something refreshing about this
story despite sundry improbabilities in the
narrative, for the landlord was the only outside
party who seemed to. have been battered or
insulted in the North for some months ; and
therefore it was a woeful disappointment to
find at the tail-end of the telegram that even
he was a “ non-union shearer,” though why a
publican should go shearing while lambing-
down i§ so much easier and more profitable is, a
mystery. This sort of thing is wearisome. Is
there not one non-unionist in, all Queensland,
who, is large enough to hit somebody back ?
.
The latest rumour in British financial circles is
that all the. big finance houses in London, Paris,
Berlin, and Vienna, with the single exception
of Rothschilds, are in, a desperately tight
place over the foreign-loan industry, and if one
of them goes there will probably be an awful
smash and about 40 millionaires will vanish
bpneath the debris. It was so easy in the old
days for a banker to lend his own money to
some busted empire at the rate of £5O or £6O
for every £lOO debenture, and then softly un-
load on the idiotic public at £9O, that the
financiers hardly realised the situation when
the public stopped buying and left the last
batch of loans on their hands. About once
every year, these speculators used to lend every-
thing, down to their clothes and boots, to any
insolvent State that wanted money, and after-
wards pass the loss on to the nation generally
at an advanced figure. The process only
needed to miss fire once, and the syndicates
were left on the instant with tons of paper
securities and hardly enough ready cash to buy
a sandwich. When a bank buys up a
£20,000,009 loan and can’t see it again, it is
obvious that that bank is in a tight place, and
when it has to find another loan next year to
keep the borrowing Government from going
bankrupt it is still worse, for it can’t raise the
new loan through all its capital being sunk in
the old one, and if it doesn’t do it the old loan
isn’t worth anything, and all the capital dis-
appears there and then. This sort of thing is
unpleasant for the banker, but in the end it does
a lot of good to the world at large. When a
man has got about a hundred-thousand times
his fair share of the world’s wealth and tries to
keep on doubling his pile at short intervals, it
is obvious that he or his descendants must own
the earth some day and leave nothing for any-
body else unless a smash comes.
The same old giddy infant rushing miserably
into destruction has turned up once more—this
time at Dunedin (Maoriland). She was a small
female child of eleven, -with an old, old eye and
a look of ancient wisdom on her crinkled
features, and she called round in a calm, self-
possessed way at the police-station, and told
the inspector how she had been “ assaulted ” by
Andrew Manson, artizan. She was such a
parched, dried-up prehistoric-looking infant
that the officer was staggered, and though he
hardly believed her, she swore affidavits and
took oaths with such surprising fluency that
there was nothing for it but to run Manson in.
The accused appeared at the police-court next
morning, and tried in a dazed, astonished way
to find out what it was all about; but his
accuser climbed into the witness-box with a
considerable exhibition of white stockings and
undergarments and swarmed up on a chair so
that her head might appear over the top, and
talked the court nearly to death in about two
minutes. Then she danced down again, and
the bench committed Manson for trial, and
went home wondering at the prematurely aged
and blase aspect of the prosecutor. And finally
the Assizes came on, but by this time Manson
had recovered his senses sufficiently to hire a
lawyer, and that person drew the infant out till
she abandoned all considerations of time and
space, and made statements that were contrary
to the laws of gravitation and cohesion and
everything else; and then she burst into tears
and acknowledged that she had got the whole
story from another girl, and that the other girl
had got it out of a newspaper. Whereupon
she climbed out of the witness-box with
another exhibition of white stockings and
undergarments, and fled for home. The story
doesn’t go any further. If this infant with the
ancient eye and the old understanding had per-
jured herself over a case of petty larceny there
would have been trouble, but no one ever
dreams of prosecuting the girl who has faked up
an indecent story with a view to getting a man
—often a complete stranger—sent into penal
servitude. There are about three dozen such
girls loose in various parts of Australasia, and
they are mostly prospering.
A young man, from beyond the Alps,
turned up in Rome with such a perfect likeness to
the Emperor Augustus that the Emperor sent for
him. Emperor : “ Young man, was your mother
over in Rome?” The Stranger ; “No, sire ; but
tny father was.”

It is some years since “ Masks and Faces”
(by no means a very striking comedy) was seen in
Sydney, and, so far as we know, it has never pre-
viously been so well staged and played as now at
the Garrick. This sentence is penned, however,
more in condemnation of the past than in com-
mendation of the_ present, for, owing chiefly to the
weakness of Triplet and Pomander, the show
never gets, from start to finish, a good grip on the
audience. J anet Aohurch’s Peg is a very credit-
able and intelligent impersonation, but it lacks
vivacity and is more likely to please those who
see the lady for the first time than those
to whom her mannerisms items, uncertain
contralto voice, peaked - out chin, dilated
eyes, aiul colourless utterance of occasional
sentences—are familiar. Miss Achurch, however,
is at all times very much in earnest and
that is sufficient palliation for a multitude of
peculiarities. Chas. Charrington is a capable
actor, inside his limited range, and an intelligent
man, but nature never intended him to play
Triplet. He has no muscular adaptability, either
of voice or feature; his sobs are suspiciously like
guffaws ; his simulation of grief wouldn’t deceive
a sucking-child ; he habitually mispronounces his
vowels and invariably emphasises his consonants,
and, as Triplet, is a, well-meaning but melancholic
and monotonous mummer. In fact, the oast is
cursed with monotony of intonation. Eille
Norwood’s Pomander gabbles his lines with
an up-and-down inflection that suggests the
pitching of a row-boat in a tideway ; Emma
Bronton’s speeches flow forth with the smooth-
ness of soothing syrup, and Harry Power’s
Quin is simply a boor who has hardly a redeeming
feature. On the other hand, Herbert Flemming’s
V ane is finished and altogether lovely; George
Leitch’s Colley Cibber is a very clever character
sketch ; the Soaper and Snarl of Owen Harris and
William Holman are excel-
lently made-up, harmonious-
ly handled. In very minor
parts, Trent Adams’ Burdock
has a good dialect, and there
are no holes, in Charles
Westmacott’s Colander. We
nearly forgot to make men-
tion of the Kitty Clive of
Alice May, the lady’s first
big show. It is brightly
vivacious and easy, and
otherwise lacks nothing but
the height and vocal force
that nature has withheld.
The fair Janet got a
tremendous reception on
first night from, perhaps, the
biggest audience the Garrick
has yet admitted. Mr.
Wilson’s scenery deserves a
line in its praise, but some
of the furniture at Vane’s
house is surely not of “ the
period.”
sc- * sc *
“.The Bells of Hasle-
mere,” by Petti tt and
Grundy, like all the other
pot-boiling melodramas of
the period, is a mechanical
play, a mere medium for
sensational scene-shifting
and dramatic tableaux.
Perhaps its language is a
little less stilted and tauto-
logical than tli at of its
immediate predecessors on
Sydney Royal boards, but
its characters are even more
stereotyped and infinitely
less human. Some of its
villains are mere cardboard
silhouettes, who are villainous
without any apparent
motive except the will of
the author. Indeed, Thorndyke (W. H. Seagrave)
is the most unsatisfactory and inexplicable
scoundrel that was ever guyed by a gallery.
Silkstone (Albert Norman), the chief robber,
belongs to that variety of villain who sets his
heart on some other fellow’s girl or wife.
He doesn’t go the right way to win her ; he puts
the bailiff in her parents’ humble home, or that of
her friends, and occasionally drags her round by
the hair in order to arouse her dormant affection,
nevertheless is surprised to the staggering point
at each rebuff and never fails to take the gallery
into his confidence when he says : “Beware, proud
girl, the day may come when you will be compelled
to love me !” This sort of thing always reminds
us of an episode witnessed one night in Bourke-
street. AGeorgiaminstrel was fishinghimself outof
one of the odorous canals peculiar to Melbourneand
Venice. His bell-topper and gold-headed cane
were just disappearing under one of the numerous
bridges that crossed the stream, but, ere going in
pursuit, he shook his fist at the retreating form of
the fastidious nymph who had treated him to a
gratuitous wash and gurgled out with spouts of
gutter-water: “You daisy; I’ll hev you yit! ”
This piece has one peculiarity, it affords its
actresses little opportunity. Nevertheless, Norah
(the most human and understandable character in
the play), handled by Maggie Knight (she
hasn’t been seen in Sydney since she fell out of
Jennie Lee’s revival of “The Ticket-of-Leave
Man ’’ through illness), with a delicious brogue, is
the brightest and most interesting impersonation
in the play. Yore, the adventurer, ably repre-
sented by W. E. Baker (in striking contrast to his
Chicago Irishman) runs Norah a good second, and
is one of his best efforts up to date. Roberts’
Capt. Salem is fairly good, but no one else is more
than supportable, and Bland Holt’s Blacksmith
Armstrong is his worst on record, and even his
best friends in the gallery seemed delighted on
first night when lie scorched nis fingers in the
horse-shoe making scene. The big feature of the
show is Gordon’s scenery, and the manner in
which the numerous changes are made on an open
stage in full view of the audience. “ The Bells ”
are hung up for three weeks; it lias not yet been
decided what new piece they will ring in.
** * *
Contrary to first intentions, “The Silver
Shield,” by Grundy, succeeded “Imprudence,”
but is revived for six nights only. In charming
contrast to some of the sloppy work he has done
in melodrama, this is a cleverly-written, smartly-
conceived comedy, whoso failure to catch on
previously may have been due to the fact that
much of its humour is couched in stage-slang, and
is therefore not understanded of the multitude. It
seems to go better now than on the former
occasion, however, though not apparently better
impersonated. Cecil Ward has succeeded Percy
Lyndal (what lovely romantic names some actors
have!) as Tom Potter; Arthur Lawrence follows
Hilton as Sir Humphrey Chetwynd ; Geo. L.
Gordon, as Dr. Dozey, steps into the slippers and
night-cap of Geo. Leopold ; Frank Cates imper-
sonates Ned, formerly in the hands of “Bob”
Inman, and Lucy Preston, formerly played by
Miss Gilmore, is now assumed by Brenda Gibson.
“ Turned-Up,” preceded by “ Barbara,” will pro-
bably be put up on Saturday.
“The Corsican Brothers” will fade away
into the ewigkeit from Her Majesty’s stage on
Saturday next. All the machinery and the print-
ing for “The County Fair,” forwarded from
America, via Britain, to save trans-continental
freight, has not yet come to hand, so “Siberia,”
by Bartley Campbell, played at this house soon
after its opening, will probably go up in its stead
for a brief space. As this drama deals with the
persecution of Russian Jews, it will have peculiar
interest at present.

The skating season has been started at

bedrooms is shortly to be erected in the paddock

continental principles and floated into a company,
with a guarantee of six per cent, for four years on

Alf. Wyburd has been down to Melbourne

Bondi to the topmost pinnacles of prominence, at

The Majeroni benefit was, perhaps, the
most successful theatrical benefit that ever took
place in Australia. Her Majesty’s was crowded,
everywhere, even in the gallery, and the whole
areas of dress-circle and stalls were reserved long
prior to the rising of the curtain. Actors,
managers, theatre-hands, printers, bill-posters,
ushers, musicians, and representative theatre.
MISS MAGGIE KNIGHT.
goers, fairly tumbled over, one another in their
efforts to be of service, and one gentleman, Phil,
Glenister, the well-known metallician, actually
vvas responsible for the sale of 250 five-shilling
tickets. When such enthusiasm was displayed,
it is not surprising that tne sum realised should
have topped by £5O that (£400) obtained by the
benefit in this house for the Bourke Relief Fund,
albeit that was for a public calamity. Illness
prevented Signor Majeroni from attending, but a
tender and mournful letter of thanks and farewell
from this great artiste, generous and whole-souled
man, was read by George Rignold to a deeply-
interested audience.

Maggie Knight is a native of Maoriland
and went on the stage, as soon as she could lisp,
in Auckland. Since then she has travelled all
over Australasia and made one trip round the
world, playing in everything from burlesque to
tragedy. She impersonated Rosalind, Portia,
Ophelia, &0., at Melbourne Royal, and, with
Wybert Reeve, in Adelaide, we imagine, was the
first Kate Verity in “The Squire,” and Dora in,
“ Diplomacy.”
** * *
“The Middleman” has only been a
partial success at the Adelaide Royal, for Charles
Cartwright’s acting is considered extravagant,
and it has received some unpleasant criticism.
The Batty Todd of Tom Bolton is locally looked
on as the most ludicrous piece of acting seen for
many a day. One moment he may be considered
a Scotchman, at another a Jew, then an attempt
is made at the Yorkshire dialect. Olga Nether-
sole is excellent as usual, Edward Sass, Mary
Kingsley, and others render valuable support!;
but why import Cosgrove to play Captain Chand-
ler, and leave Laurence Cautley out of the cast?
“The Idler,” by special request, will be revived
ere the season closes. The Darrells will then pro-
duce “The English Rose,” supported by Lau-
rence Cautley and Mary Kingsley.
*m * *
“The Pickpocket” suffered another revival at
Me b urne Bijou on Saturday, but it was tolerably evi-
c'e it that sassiety, as represented by the dress-circle, is
crowing weary of the gentleman who wants to sit down,
and tired of even the immortal waiter. The welcoming
hack of Titheradge and Miss Emma Temple was the
feature of an uneventful evening. This Saturday (16th)
re-introduces “Comrades” to notice, and on the 23rd will
occur “The Idler,” with Cartwright and Miss Nethersole,
associated with the B. and B. company.
** * *
At the Princess’ there is still a wonderful de-
ni uul for "The Old Guard” and the beauteous bally
Therefore, Elton’s fund of merriment will be drawn upon
as usual until the 30th, when Sara Bernhardt comes along
to give them expensive lessons in French-polished acting.
Outsiders seem to think that the Star should be intro-
duced in “Camille” or “ La Tosca,” without running the
risk of playing an unfamiliar character in a strange
tongue.
The Royal is just now closed, awaiting the
advent of “Bridget O’Brien ”on Saturday. George
Darrell made his three last performances in “ Back from
the Grave,” but there was very little enthusiasm wasted
over his arrival, and the resurrection may be said to have
fallen flat.
** * *
“ Evangeline ” goes on at the Opera House in
spite of the Lone Fisherman and Catherine. Nevertheless
the time must be near at hand when Melbourne will have
learned the solemn truth about this glittering delusion,
and the management might do worse than introduce a
real novelty as soon as possible. A “Fashionable Ma-
tinee” is announced for Saturday.

Rev. Charles Clark opened a farewell season to
a crowded Athenaeum on Saturday last. It is late in the
day to sing any more praises of this accomplished lecturer
and ’twill suffice to remind admirers that there will not he
many more opportunities for hearing him on this side of
the line. The variety halls prosper) but the Albu girls,
not being in tights, attracted only the scantiest of aridi-
ences to the Town Hall.

A full notice of “ The Scout,” at the Alexandra,
before which piece of riotous realism dramatic criticism
bows its head and gasps, is held for next week.
It is better to be born under a plucky
planet than a lucky one.
The phylloxera invades the champagne
country, but there are 40,000,000 bottles in stock

While Messrs. Mitchell, of Brunambrong,
Upper Murray, were at the marriage of their
sister in Melbourne, some miscreant unknown
drove seven of their blood mares into a gully and
shot them with a rifle.
Johnston, the Ballarat man who slew his
wife and family, has been temporarily reprieved
at the instance of two well-known Ballarat
medical men who, on the night before the ap-
pointed day of execution, certified to his insanity.
How they managed to gain admission to the gaol
and the prisoner under the circumstances has not
yet transpired. On the other hand Wilson, the
obscure convict who was ordered to die for
criminal assault on a child, and who probably is
quite as mad as Johnston, duly died by the hand
of the executioner at the appointed time. A news-
paper-report states that on the scaffold Wilson
“looked round to see whether Johnston was
there.” No, dear friends, Johnston was not there.
The “ well-connected ” man is never there under
such circumstances. What a lovely satire ’twould
have been had Wilson remarked out loud to the
Sheriff ; “Where is my well-connected friend, Mr.
Johnston this morning ?”
The N.S. W. Department of Public Instruc-
tion has issued toits teachers a small volume of 150
pages, entitled, “Drink, and Strong Drink. ” From
a notice pasted inside we learn, first, that the
book is the property of the Department; next,
that the teacher is to mark, read and digest the
contents, but not to commit himself to any
extreme views when teaching—which is pretty
calm, considering that Dr. Benjamin Ward
Richardson, the gifted author, is nothing when
not a teetotal fanatic and that his book is from
beginning to end nothing but a never-touch-it
sermon. The Bulletin does not object to this,
for alcohol so eloquently sings its own praises that
it is just as well for every boy and girl to start out
in life with a prejudice against it. However, the
volume should be withdrawn from circulation at
once, as it embodies a deliberate lie which comes
in thus : at the end of the book that pure and
altogether lovely old man, Longfellow, who liked
wine, is dragged in as a total-abstinence poet,
three verses from a poem of his (the name of which
“Catawba Wine ” is artfully suppressed) being
quoted in praise of water and in denunciation of
alcoholic drink :
Now, of course, the inference sought to be drawn
by this bald quotation is that “ wine is a mocker,”
&c,, bub the truth is that Longfellow, when he wrote
the verses, was chanting, not the praises of water,
but of the wine of California, a province of his
native land, as witness the verse that immediately
follows the above in Longfellow’s poem, but which
is not quoted in the State-school book :
While pure as a spring
Is the wine I sing,
And to praise it one needs but name it ;
For Catawba wine
Has need of no sign,
No tavern bush to proclaim it..
And here are preceding verses, also carefully sup-
pressed
This song of mine
Is a song of the vine,
To be sung by the glowing embers
Of the way-side inns
When the rain begins
To darken the drear Novembers.
For richest and best
Is the wine of the West
That grows by the Beautiful River,
Whose sweet perfume
Fills all the room
With a benison on the giver.
Very good in its way
Is the Verzenay,
Or the Sillery soft and creamy;;
But Catawba wine
Has taste more divine,
More dulcet, delicious and dreamy. _
After all, considering that Australia is predestined
(“foredoomed,” the water-cranks might call U
to become one of the greatest of the world s
producing countries, it is doubtful whether, m
long run, the State would not do more good y
teaching its children to drink one part of non
native red wine with two parts of water at 111 ,
time than to cram them with teetotal poe >
under false pretences. Just read over the t
verses from Longfellow (apart from the con ,
as they are printed in the State school-book, .
see what a flavour of Moody-and-Sankey^
snuffle is imported into the whole affair by
mention of the Beautiful River—as thoug
referred to “the Jordan,” or a river runni
Heaven, or some other article of the pa
stock-in-trade !
There grows no wine
By the haunted Rhine,
By the Danube or Guadalquiver,
Nor on island or cape,
That hears such a grape
As grows by the Beautiful River.
Drugged is their juice
For foreign use,
When shipped o’er the reeling Atlantic
To rack our brains
With fever pains
That have driven the Old World frantic.
To the sewers and sinks
With all such drinks,
And after them tumble the mixer,,
For a poison malign
Is such Borgia wine,
Or at best, but a “ Devil’s Elixir.!’

A person named H. Bellyse Baildon, from somewhere in
Europe, has arrived in Australia and is going to deliver
lectures. If he knew the rage that consumes the Aus-

Baildon would probably have stayed away.
Melbourne Standard, evidently desiring to bestow
butter, referred to “that good, old-fashioned Adelphi
drama, ‘The Courier of Lyons.”’ After this, Dampier
may well pray to be saved from his newspaper friends.
“ The Courier of Lyons” is a work of art founded on his-
torical fact, and no more resembles the typical Adelphi
rubbish (of which “ Lights o’ London ” is'a modern imita-
tion! than ’Enry Parkes resembles George Washington. It
takes rank amongst the stage classics in France and Eng-
land, and will, no doubt, be supplying material for
plagiarists until the crack of doom.

Lawrence. Barrett did not take in London, where, despite

One of the Melbourne amateurs', a low comedian to

smoothed his hair, went on—and a bunch of carrots landed
right in the middle ot his smirk.
At a Melbourne amateur performance, Percy O’More,
the representative of the old miser, Soldering Solomon,
tinker, came on hugging his handkerchief full of “ Go-o-ld,
go-o-ld Oho!” but it burst, and scattered old china all
over the stage, amid universal derision A profound
moral in that, too.
While Barry Sullivan had the Melbourne Royal, Bick
Qox, the leading man par excellence, applied for an
engage merit, in the dog’-days, hot-wind going, 'k&ys
Barry, sitting in awful state: “Well, Mr. Cox, Lve
nothin"- worthy of your abilities, but if a matter of three
nounds per week” A long pause, broken by Barry
Sullivan: “Warm, Mr. Cox.” “Yes, too blooming hot
for me altogether,” and Cox was off.
Barry Sullivan caused “Box and Cox” to be acted, frohi
the text, for the first time in Melbourne. Bick Stewart
and Long Andrews began to rehearse, with the chain of
while Barry stood in front, with the book lying
tacVdownwards before him on the stage. Presently he
handed it over with “ Please, Mr. Andrews, show me that
passage you are speaking.” “Oh, sir, we always gag
‘Box and Cox.’” “Bo you? Well, you don tat my
theatre.”
Some obscure periodical has wounded the feelings of
Lance Lenton by announcing that he sings his own songs
at the Gaiety Hall, Melbourne, “with great success,
whereas he merely pleads guilty to writing some of them.
Lenton has, in fact, left the modern stage to its fate, and
swears that he will never return, except to play Macbeth
for a short season of farewell benefits.
Barry Sullivan—no matter what his Australian admirers
may say—never had anything of a reputation in London,
and his last engagement at Brury Lane, in 187 C, was a
black frost. Irving had been playing “Richard the
Third” at the Lyceum only a few’ months earlier, and
Whilst lie, with all his angularities and mannerisms,
looked like a Scholar born to command, Barry Sullivan
represented the old bellowing butcher-breed of Richard—
a penny plain and twopence coloured Crookback. The
most trustworthy record of Richard credits him with a
handsome face, polished manner, and cultured mind—a
great man, who had the Bevii mostly perched on his
deformed shoulder. Miln’s will be a fine performance of
Richard when he can be persuaded to shake off the Bevii
occasionally, and to act it throughout instead of reserving
himself for the big speeches.
The “Firm’s ” parting with Cartwright seems to have
been a friendly arrangement at the last, assisted to a con-
summation by the fact that W. & G. will have the Bivine
Sara and the Gaiety Company on their hands at one time.
Cartwright and Olga Nethersole have worked up a big
name in Melbourne, and are likely to have a very fashion-
able following at the Bijou.
It is proposed to give a benefit to Mr. R. B. Wiseman, a
theatrical manager of many years’ standing, who has
fallen on evil days and is threatened with the loss of his
eyesight; he is now an inmate of Prince Alfred Hospital,
Sydney.
Thus a New York critic on Bernhardt’s Tosoa: —“I
close my eyes for a second, and I hear a thunderous out-
burst. I start, sit bolt upright and see Sara, who has
entered the church and joined Mario. She stands and
bows, displacing Sardou’s verbal calisthenics for the sake
ot responding to the welcome of a ‘ brilliant ’ audience,
then drops instantly from Sara Bernhardt to Floria Tosca
—it is a leap that might almost fracture her bones—and
the play proceeds.”
Toole, who talks of starting an Australian museum in
London, says he thoroughly believes that Irving intends
to visit Australia. Henry will see how Sara gets on.
Nellie Stewart, it is cabled, has declined several British
offers of engagement, but will probably open in the new
opera at the Savoy, in the “ Nautch Girl.” Show for the

A swell dramatic club was acting “ Luke the Laborer - ’
in a Melbourne suburb, and a great disturbance took place
when Philip, the sailor, came on, whereupon he gagged,
“ I know who’s making this row—some of you chaps of
the tradesmen’s club,” and then he wound up by jumping
off the stage and pitching into a fellow in the stalls.
Brough and Boucicault adopt a curt style of advertising
which doesn’t entirely please their Co., who all have the
portico of their names chopped off : thus Anson_ loses his
CL W., Browne her Pattie, and so on. But business-like
Boucicault must needs announce “The Butler” as by
Herman Merivale, whereas Mrs. H. M. had the best share
in it, and, further, Bouoy gives Merivale all the credit for
the authorship of “ Forget-Me-Not.”

In an American western town lately, an Evangeline
sort of troupe stuck up its posters, with a plentiful ais-
play of nether limbs, and the local authorities. oraerea
that they should be coveted Up, whereupon the bili-postei
affixed something like paper trousers, but the rail
descended and washed them off. The manager was
accordingly summoned. The Bench decided that he na
complied with the order.
Little Musgrove has, it is cabled, reconciled Gilbert and
Cellier. Thanks, but we didn’t know they’d quarreheo.
Probably, the row arose over Gilbert’s latest opera, which
Cellier was supposed to work on during his Australian
trip. Alfred has the reputation of uncertainty. Ihe tact
is that ho is in Very ill-health.
Thanks to Mayor Manning, the padlock has been re-
moved from Sydney Town Hall organ, and Mr. Neville
Barnett, at the “Elijah” performances, was permitted
to show that local talent knows enough to handle the big
instrument without tearing its stops out by the roots and
kicking its pedals into its chest, as Mayor Burdekin feared
they would. Unfortunately, however, w'hile gaming a
player, Sydney lost a critic, for, unlike many of his
brother musicians, we do not believe that Mr. Barnett
would be guilty of administering to himself the unquali-
fied marmalade shovelled out to him by the S.M. Herald,
to the staff of which he is musically attached.

A new American theatre has been named “ The Colum-
bus.” That’s one big point in favour of Americans, they
don’t slavishly copy from older countries. We have
“ Royals,” “ Princesses,” Gaietys,”and “ Operas ” all over
Australia, and not one name for a theatre that has not
come down to us from our ancestors on a play-bill.
While Charles Mathews occupied London Lyceum, he
was playing a season to poor houses which one evening
he augmented by a liberal output of “paper.” That
night the gallery was very noisy and not a word could be
heard at times. At length Charles marched down to the
footlights and said: “ Gentlemen of the gallery, although
you have paid for your seats, you have no right to disturb
the comfort of the people in the stalls who have not.’

When the late Barry Sullivan was running a double
company at the old Melbourne Royal, and producing
first-class pieces, Charles Kean, under the guidance of
George Coppin and the patronage of Governor Sir
Charles Darling, was playing at the old Haymarket.
Darling was almost every night at Kean’s show, owing, it
was said, to a special tip from “ home.” Sullivan wrote
asking the Governor’s patronage on a particular evening,
and received the A.D.O.’s reply that “ Sir Charles could
not patronise any other theatre than the Haymarket
while Mr. Kean was playing there.” He enclosed, how-
ever, a cheque for the vice-regal box for the night. This
Sullivan promptly returned with the curt information
that he wanted the Governor's patronage and not his
money. A Governor’s money is worth more than his
patronage even to-day.
That is a smart retort in “Imprudence” when the
cynical gentleman who lives on his wits asks the ingenue:
“Do you wish to break my heart?” The reply, sobbed
out: “Stone-breaking isn’t woman’s work,” fetches them.
Sara Bernhardt and Co. propose very rapid changes of
programme at Melbourne Princess’—a new piece every
third night. “Theodora” is to be done if Gordon,
Brunton, Goatcher and Hennings can paint good enough
scenery. Cheeky this. The best scene Bernhardt carries
is one painted bv M. M. Rube, Chaperon and Jambon, of
Paris, for “Cleopatra.” Gamier followed her to New
York but doesn’t come here apparently. There was a fight
between Abbey and Arthur over the prices. Arthur
expounded the Toole disaster ; Abbey caved.
A New York doctor says: “In my opinion, there is less

It all depends on what he means by “ actresses.” If he

Upon relinquishing her post as matron of the Sydney

Frank Burgh and Emma Burgh, man and wife, ar e
simply making a fortune, by exhibiting themselves all
over Germany; they have already done Vienna and
Berlin. They are youngish people, and the attraction is
the amazing tattoo allover their bodies, of which they
show as much as possible, without shook, for tattoo has a
curious effect, as of clothing, and quite takes away the
idea of nakedness. Frank has the Crucifixion beauti-
fully tattooed on his chest, and Emma has the Last Supper
done with equal skill upon her back. One of her legs is
tattood all over with emblems of Ireland, and the other
with emblems of America. Frank has . a fine portrait of
Emma on his stomach. It would almost take a to
describe all the picture-tattooing. For the time being
this show runs away with the money. The Burghs are
Irish-^mericana.

Says the London correspondent of the Adelaide AdvER
I’iSKR t —“ Three years ago when Madame Melba came
home resolved to become a great priina donna she
separated amicably from her husband, Mr. Armstrong.
Matrimony must not, they resolved, burke her artistic
career. Now, however, that the goal has been reached,
and the fair Australian stands second only as a songstress
to Patti, there seems no further necessity to repress the
softer emotions, so when Mr. Armstrong arrived home
three weeks ago he was received practically as well as
metaphorically with open arms. The couple have re-
solved to live together henceforward, Mr. Armstrong
giving up his business in Australia to look after his bril-
liant wife’s affairs in Europe. He will take a run out to
sell up his colonial properties, and then settle permanently
in Europe. Melba is, of course, in the way of becoming a
rich woman.”
Colonel Henry Maplesoh, the once mighty entrepre-
neur, lately separated from Marie Roze, has married
Laura Schirmer Byron, the beautiful thirty-year-old
American priind donna, who, of her own accord, entered,
it is said, the Sultan’s seraglio at Constantinople,- but
somehow (assuming that she ever was in the harem)
escaped, married Byron, the British tenor, and opened an
opera-house at Constantinople. It failed, and Byron
drowned himself in a Hellespont of booze. Lord Lytton
assisted at the ceremony. He naturally would.
Nudity having reached its zenith in the stark bareness
of Sybil Johnstone as Ira in “The Cleraenceau Case,” a
reaction has set in against the wearing of tights through-
out America, and the majority of the leading burlesque
ladies have flatly refused to don anything but skirts in
future. It is to be hoped they’ll stick to the resolution,
for the ordinary woman, inkneed, big stomached, and
loose bosomed, is a hideously uninviting object when not
“fixed up.” The sculptors and painters are responsible
for the false ideas of feminine loveliness that permeate the
masculine brain. Your Venus of Milo, Power's Greek
Slave, the Aphrodite of Titians, the Chloes of half-a-dozen
painters, and the Dutch-built beauties of Rubens, are
symbols of feminine beauty—the perfections of a dozen
imperfect women skillfully pieced together—and by no
means truthful representations of feminine shapeliness.
In fact, select at random half-a-dozen men from any class,
and they will be found in point of shapeliness, individual
for individual, immeasurably superior to any similarly
selected six women of similar age and condition. As an
aesthetic spectacle, full-grown man is miles ahead of full-
grown woman, whose loveliness in 99 cases out of 100 is
a mere figment of the imagination.
Sarah Bernhardt’s proper (Christian) name is Rosine
She was born at Paris, Oct. 22, 1844, and is a Jewess of
French and Dutch parentage. Her early life was chiefly
spent at the house of her grandfather, an Amsterdam
optician. Entered Paris Conservatoire 1858, second prize
for tragedy 1881, and for comedy 1862. First stage
appearance, Theatre Francais, as Racine’s Iphigiinie and ,
Scribe’s Valerie. Failure. Acted burlesque at Gymnase
and Porte St. Martin. At the Odeon, 1867, made a mark,
culminating with Marie di Neuborg, in “ Ruy Bias.”
Returned to the Francais, and was thenceforward mighty.
The apex, zenith, and apogee of Christmas pantomimes
in London was reached 1862, when there were 21, all clever,
original, successful; Byron furnishing 4 splendid ones, the
Covent Garden, Adelphi, Strand, and St. James’s ! Nel-
son wrote 300 pantomimes, and Akhurst, of Melbourne,
fully held his own with the Blanchards, Broughs, Tal-
fourds, and Burnands. Why, they turned out Bvangehnes
by the bushel.
Julia Edouin is dead. Tire Edouin family, as before the
English and Australian public 35 years ago, consisted of
Charles, John, Eliza, Rose, Willie, and Julia, the last four
child-actors. Charles, puffy and genial, was manager,
and, some few remember him, an indifferent clown ; his
widow is Mrs. Edouin-Bryer, erstwhile Lizzie Naylor, and
their daughter is Lizzie Bryer. John, only good as
harlequin,Wedded Tilly Earl, but Eliza Edouin, genius of
the family, died ere reaching womanhood, and Rose took
her place, becoming a leading performer and manager,
even as Willie is in London. Julia was petite and piquant,
and the writer well remembers how he was embarrassed
once through having to kiss her, on the amateur stage, in
“ Time Tries All.”

Vague rumours about another revolution
brewing in Hayti. The population of this cheer-
ful State consists of a large number of assorted
niggers, a lot of mulattoes, and some whites, and
they run the Government turn-about. As soon as
the niggers have set up a Cabinet the whites
revolushe, and whenever the whites have started
an administration the niggers revolushe. If the
mulattoes get up anything both the other parties
revolushe. The Dictator generally leans up
against a post in the main street of the capital
with his head in a water-melon, and the Ministers
of State angle for catfish on the wharf. Some-
times there are as many as six Dictators at once,
and they have unseemly scuffles in the palace and
try to choke each other in the doorways. The
boss Dictator for the time being prints all the
paper money, and keeps no accounts. Hayti had
one period of transient prosperity, when a man
nearly seven feet high got.into power and remained
there for eight years, but one morning there was
the usual revolution, and since then all has been
general wreck.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
At a recent pony meeting a certain stable de-
cided to back their pony No. 1, but, not being able to ge >
a fair price, put their money- some £3oo—on their nexs
best, No. 2, at a long shot. The “stiffening ot No. 1,
however, was scarcely satisfactory. So soon as the stable
money went on No. 2, No. 1 went back to a low price,
whena jockey, also riding a pony in the race, thought ne
saw a good investment for a fiver, so put it on No. 1.
Approaching home No. 2 appeared to be winning com-
fortably, but the jockey who had backed No. 1 kept his
mount alongside that animal, and when the time armed
brought his whip down one, two, three on No. 1 s rump,
and before the latter’s jockey could understand matters
he had passed No. 2.and won by a head. Fact—as evi-
denced by the three stinging whip-marks which No. i
carried home on a spot where bis own jockey could not
possibly have reached him,

Davies, the first bookmaker honoured as “the
Leviathan ”—a title divided in Melbourne between Joe
Thompson and Billy Slack—was a journeyman London
caruenter, but in five years made £140,000, inventing
the list system at hotels. He shelled out £40,000 over one
race, all loss. The biggest bet on record was between
Lords Glasgow and G. Bentinck, £90,000 to ±30,000.
Both deserved to die in the gutter, but such people
never do.

The death of jockey Roger Davis recalls, after
many years, a racing incident—at present running in
mutilation through the Australian country press—wlueli
is worthy of authentic record. Twenty years ago Colonel,
a favourite horse of the late Mr. Robert Frost, of Orange
(N.S.W.) was matched at Dubbo to race Mr. Tarrant s
mare, Barmaid, from l)nbbo to Orange, a distance of 10c
miles, for £loo' aside, and in the early morn of the
appointed day the pair were started in front of the Dubbo
Post-office,-Davis riding Colonel, and Walter Hiokinbotham,,
of Carbine fame, taking Barmaid for the journey. After
passing Wellington, Davis took the Molong route, Hickm-
botham going vid Ironbarks, and at half-past four o clock
p,m,—nine and a-half hours after starting Colonel gal-
loped through Orange streets and pulled up for the first
time since starting in front of his owner’s residence in
Anson-street. Then followed a unique excitement that is
still unforgotten. The Orange I’ost-offioe, the appointed
winning-post, was round the corner a block away ; as the
horses had taken different routes, Barmaid s actual where-
abouts was unknown, but hoof-beats on the metal were
heard in the distance, and Colonel, having come 100 miles
to his own stable was not inclined to pass it, plunging and
rearing at each effort made to urge him on to the goal.
Another hundred yards would end the race, but ten
minutes of anxious time were passed before he yielded to
Davis’ perseverance and made a record that remains un-
beaten. Barmaid knocked up at Shepherd’s Creek, 30
miles from Orange, and did not reach that town until next
dav. Colonel was in such heart at the finish that his
owner offered to wager that Davis could ride him to
Bathurst, 35 miles further, in three hours without dis-
mounting, and two days after he himself took him to ride
to The owner, trainer and rider of the horse that
performed this memorable feat have all since passed
awav. The trainer, Charlie Bennett, died many years
ao-o ; the spirited owner, one of the whitest of white men,
had his honourable life ended by a fall from a horse in
sight of his own estate, Campdale, just three years ago ,
and flower Davis, the rider, was done to death at last
Molong° races. The gallant horse died in one of the pad-
docks of the estate 12 months after the death of the master
he had faithfully carried for many years.

About the saddest spectacle we know of is to be
found on the racecourse. We have watched it often, and
it makes us feel bad every time. The spectacle we allude
to is the horse-owner who is trying to look glad on an
up-hill track. His animal is a hot favourite for a big
race, and the public has laid everything on it right up to
its hair and its brains, and then the “books have squared
the proprietor, and he has made it right with the
iookey. He stands to win a tremendous sum it his horse
loses, and to win a lot more if another horse gets in
first • and just when everything is comfortable and
happy he sees something before his staring and in-
furiated head that makes him think lie must be dead and
in Gehenna —it is his thrice-accursed horse winning the
race in a 'canter after all. There is a wild yell of joy
from the whole meeting, and lie is expected to look as it
he were full of unspeakable happiness-and so he is; he is
as happy as a man who has sat down in the fire. He has
won a £lOOO stake and lost a £lO,OOO swindle, and some
sixty or more unhanged furies come round and congratu-
late'him, and he wants to be a centipede so that he can
kick them with a hundred clawed feet at once. He states
that he is profoundly gratified, and smiles a smile that
looks as if he had swallowed himself, and he thanks
them all in a subdued howl and is full of execration right
down to his boots. And when the jockey who sold him
comes by he has to express his admiration of the way he
won the race, when the thing he really wants is to teal oft
that youth’s head and throw it up into the telegraph-
wires. And then the “winner” travels serenely round
for a while receiving the congratulations of all hisfnends,
and goes away into a lonesome spot behind the refreshment
booth, and screams, and tears up great chunks of fi arth
with his nails.

“Dummy” Mace, pugilist, who was beaten by
Dawson the other evening in Sydney, is, as hit) nickname
implies, a mute. He had plenty of confidence prior to the
battle. “How are you going to get on f asked a friend
of his a dav or two before-hand. Dummy s face brightened
up and lie began to “ shape” at an adjacent circular-saw,
as if to say that he felt game even to'fight that. A Sydney
daily winds up the report with this: It was palpable
that Mace was beaten. . . . Dawson, with a look of
disinclination and sympathy, punched him in the jaw,

Though no names are mentioned, “Pendragon,”
in a recent number of the Referee, throws light on a
mystery of the P.R. This is the squaring of the Heenan-
King fight. The Benicia Boy was offered a bribe to take
a dose of poison the day before the fight. He took it but
disgorged the drug. The other side, not to be outwitted,
bribed his second, who did not appeal to the referee
when King was fairly knocked out early in the Amt, for
the simple reason that he had only just dosed Heenan
and was waiting until the poison operated. Heenan soon
became stupid, and King, who had fairly lost the fight,
then gave him an awful drubbing. In 1877 the second
wrote to Bell’s Life that Heenan sold the battle for
£2OOO, but all who knew the writer did not believe him,

ustrous gems the dewy, dilated leaves of a young
jelery-topped pine just inside of the western wall
if the stockade; beyond the high pales, a verdant
aspect which wanted but the lowing kine and the
□ox and hawthorn hedges to convince the spectator
;hat one of the countless beauty-spots of the pure
Me “set in the inviolate sea” bad been trans-
planted to this realm of lawlessness; beyond all to
she west, the yeasty surge with its mournful song,
“compassed within a single note;” to the east,
mute figures of destiny, “a thin red line of
soldiers ; in the centre of the quadrangle, flaming
and sparkling nobly, the Union Jack which
haunts its bravery at a height of 80 feet from the
tapered crown of a pine-bole —and, at the foot of
the flagstaff, the triangles. This is the scene.
And the occasion ? The infliction of punishment
on Jane Applegarth, legally convicted of an
offence against the person of Frederick 1 >. Lankes,
Captain in His Majesty’s - th Regiment of Foot,
Penal Commandant at Macquarie Harbour*, but
actually to be penalised for declining to include
herself in the number of the Captain’s concubines.
“ Wherever flies the British flag, declared Lord
Brougham, in a magnificent peroration which
brought tears to the eyes of his auditors, “ there
rule the immutable principles of British justice.”
* * *
A beat of the drums and a clanging of the
fire-locks as they are brought to the salute
announced the arrival of Captain Bankes. He is in
levee uniform, and the bullioned knots of his sword-
tassels gleam richly and the lucid steel of the
scabbard shines whitelyas he marches towards the
centre of the square. Half-way to the flagstalf
he stops, turns round and faces his quarters. At
least that is what the building was known as
officially, but, under the circumstances, it might
not inappropriately be termed his harem. And,
facing it, what does he do? Does he cast an in*
specting eye over the accoutrements and dressing
of the crimson row which proclaims the kinship of
Sarah Island with Windsor Castle and the Houses
of Parliament at Westminster? Not he ; British
Institutions are great, but Love is mightier. Cap-
tain Bankes flicks from the tips of his dogskin
gloves a kiss to a lady who peers curiously through
the open window of the Captain’s She
is late of rising this pleasant morning is Fanny
Cockburn (21), per ship Duke of Wellington, No.
518, and rather than lose the prospect of the
method by which a due perception of the
omnipresence of British Justice is to be engrafted
in Jane Applegarth’s blood (Jane was No. 513
by the same vessel) Fanny, Concubine-in-Chief,
appears at the window in a negligee costume.
Though her shoulders are not bare, they are so
thinly-clad by their laced frippery, that she
shudders slightly as the breath of the morning
nips them. She observes the Captain-Com-
mandant’s salute, and prettily returns it the same
instant as she calls to Perry, her fellow-transport
but lesser light of the seraglio per the Duke, to
bring her a warm wrap.
The care with which the Commandant furnished
the wardrobe of his ladies was only equalled by
his attentiveness to the duty of seeing that their
garments were properly paid for out of the Settle-
ment’s accounts. The stock of men’s shirts was
always deficient compared with the time record,
but the System was so perfectly organised that the
loss on that item was made up by a surplus of
ladies’ lingerie. Three “ration” shirts would
always purchase a finely-frilled chemise, and
though the male-convicts to whom the former
“ were issued ” never received the coarse things,
they would, doubtless, have grown warm with an
unselfish glow had they reflected that their shirts’
equivalent,, the finely-frilled chemise, was worn on
the chastely-curved shoulders of Fanny Cockburn
and those of her predecessors and successors.
# # *
The Captain, still in the first glamour of
an unholy love, is rejoiced at his Fanny’s return-
kiss, and, like a knight of the old chivalrous ages
who fought the harder when benisoned by his
ladye-love’s smile, he rushes the more impetuously
into the fray. In other words, he is so fortified
by the assuring glance of the principal of his fair
ones, that while he has entered the quadrangle
with a shrinking fear of what Convict Jane
Applegarth will say to him before the men of the
guard, he is now determined to go through the
whole punishment-routine, and to set the woman
at defiance. She has a pointed tongue has Jane,
and he has already writhed under it, but now he
is resolved, dauntless, and immoveable—in the
interests of Justice.
Thus the scene; now for the action.
* * *
“ Bring out the prisoner,” Bankes ordered.
And Jane Applegarth, 513, per Duke of Welling-
ton, was ushered from the cells. Behind her step
three or four warders and the sconrger. The last
is to be known to the present generation by the
cognomen of Wiry Ned. It cannot be said that
the appellation was peculiarly appropriate, looking
at his build, for, if anything, he was, notwith-
standing the superabundant exercise which the
System required him to take, grossly-bulky. James
Backhouse, the Quaker Missionary, wrote of the
punishment returns of two or three years later
that the number of lashes inflicted on 188
prisoners was 0280. Of course the good Friend
went solely by the records, and as Macquarie
Harbour Pumshment-book must have been a
model of the System’s unveracity (unless men like
Commissariat-Officer Lempriere and Under.
Sheriff Crouch lied, the average weekly “dose
would furnish good exercise to the official flogger.
When Backhouse knew him after he had wielded
many more round thousands of cuts he was still
fleshy, so we may presume he was peculiarly well
supplied with adipose tissue on this refreshing
morning. Why, then, he was called Wiry, is a
mystery, unless it was that ho was fond of assert-
ing that “he didn’t believe in no copper-wire
crackers to his cats, like Loo’ten’t Darrell, for
he’d lay Ms ’cad he’d pickle a man as neatly wi’out
th’ wire as wi’ it.” It was this connoisseur in
“cats” to whom Jane Applegarth was to be
handed over for what the historian Kusden is
accustomed to mildly term eccentric punish-
merits.”
Inoo V\ e - gir V P • J” arl^ 8, .
Dickson ” (this to the burgeon) there is no
reason why the prisoner should not be punished.
A squat figure, with eyes that spoke eloquently
of a long over-night debauch, stepped from behind
the line of the soldiers, felt Applegarth’s pulse,
bent its head to the girl’s bosom to listen to the
beating of her heart, parted with flippant fingers
the eyelids which would have shrouded the shame-
stricken gaze, and said —
“ Oh, she’s strong enough, sir, and can take her
c l o se.”
Wiry Ned laid his hand upon the girl’s shoulder
anc j pushed her with more show of rudeness than
was the fact towards the triangles. She moved for-
ward mechanically to the punishment-machine —
an q t be Union Jack.
Bankes followed her with his eyes, and then, as
THE NEW SOCIAL FUNCTION.
WRITWRIGHT (the Melbourne Solicitor): “Reprieve Johnston, sir? Absurd! Besides, I’m
promised six tickets for the execution, and the duty of the Crown is clear.”
she neared the whipping-post, saw a ray of the
new sunlight flash from one of the legs of the
accursed tripod. The shiny appearance of the
wood struck him as being singular. He put up
his eye-glass, looked at it a second time, and then
expressed a laudable curiosity to know what was
the cause of that glinting.
“ What on earth have you been doing, Seourger,
to the triangles ? What makes ’em shine so this
morning?”
Ned turned round with a grin ornamenting the
flabbiness which hid his criminal facial angle,
“ Oh, Comd’nant, I tho’t as how this bein’ a ’tic’ler
’kashun, I’d rub ’em up a bit, so I polished ’em
wi’ sand.”
Ob, the gay laugh that rippled from the upper
window, to melt into the boisterous merriment of
Captain Bankes and Surgeon Dickson. The girl
Cockburn thought the idea so funny !
* * *
Jane was triced up, and Captain Bankes
bethought himself as he was strong he would be
merciful. He would give the hardened criminal
at the triangle (not the choice of punishments—
they were already fixed by the Magistrate) but of
the order of her punishment.
“Pris’ner,” he exclaimed, an august condescen-
sion lending a pleasing tone to his voice. “ Will
you be shaved first or have the flogging first ? ”
She turned her head upon her shoulders and
looked at him. Nevertheless, answer she made
not, save for the look of stinging contempt with
which she scanned him.
Up to this time she had worn undisturbed her
upper garment. Possibly it was thoughtlessness
on Wiry Ned’s part that had permitted him to
allow her to retain unviolated by his hand the
flimsy thing which guarded her modesty from the
rude eyes whose slightest glance was an insult.
From what followed, however, we are inclined to
think that it was not thoughtlessness, but thought-
fulness. The look of contempt with which the
prisoner favoured the Commandant unloosed, so
to speak, that bodice. Officer—and Gentleman—
Bankes could not but resent the girl’s scorn, and
sharply he called Wiry Ned to order.
“Oh, you won’t speak, won’t you, you jade?
You talked too much before, and now your game
is silence, is it ? We'll fix the progression of events.
What do you say, Doctor?- shall we give her the
cat first? And by Seourger, why haven’t you
stripped her ?” . . ~
The Doctor was prompt in answering : W ell,
I should say, sir, shave her first, then flog her,
and then ”
Jane spoke now. This time, however, she flung
her words, with another look of vitriolic derision,
at the doctor. “And brand her,” she said, com-
pleting his sentence.
The Seourger was almost as ready as the Doctor
to speak. He had coached himself in his line of
speech and action, and said: “I didn’t think as
’ow yer’d want it, Com’dant —my leetle tools ’ll do
the work so well. They’ll bring the dress off with
the tail, sir, each stroke. Just yer see now, sir
—and the beggar affected a chuckle. Following
his words he stooped down, apparently to throw
round the limb another bight of the cord which
fastened Jane’s ankle to the cross-bar—he had so
far respected her sex that he did not “ spread-
eagle ” her, and had linked the two legs of the
tripod by a piece of pine-batten —and while thus
stooping he bade her in a whisper “not to be
afeerd ! I ain’t agoin’ to nick yer on’y a codger,”
The girl bowed her head. She heard the whis-
pered words, though as the Scourger’s humorous
reference to the notion he said he had of bringing
away her dress and her skin in the one stroke had
distended the laughter-loving mouth of the
medical man, it would not have been surprising
had she failed to learn that the Scourger’s
sympathies were to be directed in her direction.
The ankle-knot having been adjusted, the Wiry
’Un rose to his full height, saluted, and informed
the Commandant that he was ready.
“Got the shears?” queried the Commandant.
A leather-cased bundle lay at the far foot of the
triangles. In a second of time the Seourger had
the packet untied, and its contents exposed to the
gaze of everyone on, or overlooking, the square.
Some of the' articles that were in it fell clanking
to the gravel; they were not wanted just
yet; they were not yet red-hot; their function
was an hour in the future. But the “cat ” and the
shears were for almost immediate use.
“ Yes, sir.”
“ Then shave her.”
Wiry Ned in after years became rather a
favourite of Parson Marsden’s—whose admiring
contemporaries of tener spoke of him as “Old Flog-
>em by whom Ned was made an overseer at
Parramatta, and the ladies fair who there visited
the Factory for the purpose of being “ barbered,”
were, as often as not, dealt with by the ex-scourger
of the Harbour. Seldom in those Parramatta days
(so the Wiry Ned used to say, at least) had it ever
been his good fortune to handle and to scissor so
beautiful a mass of tawny hair as dropped to the
ground from Jane Applegarth’s head. It is a
digression, but we may as well remark that, when
Ned sold a batch one day of convict-women’s hair
to Foss, the chemist, of 18 Pitt Street, Sydney,
predecessor to John Tawell, Quaker and murderer,
he lamented that ho had never kept Jane’s hair.
“Lor’, Mr. Ambrose,” he said, “she’s a well-to-
do woman now, I b’heve, but she ain’t got no ’air
to equal that wot I snipt off ’er at the ’arbour nine
year ago. Lor’, sir, I’d ’a wanted a yellow-boy an
ounce for that wig of her’n.”
As it lay on the Macquarie Harbour soil,
there being no local market for such rubbish,
Jane Applegartlrs tawny mane was left to
be tossed by the pitying breeze, and to be
trodden upon by brutish feet. As the shears— ’
did we make it quite clear to you that the
Wiry ’Un was also Settlement barber—touched
her scalp and neck with their cold rims, she
shuddered, and looked piteously at the tonsorial
artist. The glory of her sex fell from her, it
seemed, as the locks shimmered through the sun-
shine in their descent.
“ Ready, sir ! ” cried Ned, as he stepped back
and ‘ ‘ combed ” the cats with the fingers of his
left hand, and nursed a stray strand back into its
place. “Ready, sir!”
The Doctor stepped forward, and looked at the
Commandant. The Commandant looked at the
Doctor —and nodded. And the Doctor said,
Now ! ”
# * *
The cats swirled, and the body of the
woman took a half-twist. But it must have been
from the shame of the blow, and not from its pain.
A strip of dress came away —no skin.
“ One ! ” cried the Doctor. In most settlements
the principal constable tallied the cuts, but at the
Harbour it was a privilege—may we hope a highly
esteemed one—of the medical men.
“ Two ! ” Another strip of the checked stuff
fell from the cats—still no skin; neither, any
blood.
“Three!” “Four!” “Five!” —the blows
fell quickly—too quickly to please the gentlemen
of the Old Regime. Of what value was punitive
discipline, if the Scourger was to make things light
by hitting quickly, when the slower blows inflicted
more pain ?
Thus thinking, Duty—“ stern daughter of the
voice of God ’’—bade the doctor interfere.
“ Here. I say, scourger ! What are you up to ?
You are codgering, man.” The subordinate
official of the Regime thereupon put a little more
vim into his next blow, but took the opportunity,
though, of making a slip in his step, so bringing
himself for the moment close to Jane. “ I’ll ’ave
to give yer jest one, me lass, so toe your chalk ! ”
By which whisper the treacherous fellow conveyed
his wish that she should brace herself for the one
or two torturing cuts that he felt called upon—in
the interests of one Wiry Ned, Scourger—to
administer. He might successfully “codger,”
say, 18 blows out of 20 ; but, if, by the time the
score was tallied, no reddish-blue wheals were im-
printed on her flesh, then by one of those sudden
transitions for which the System was famous, and
through which the hangman often become the
hanged and the scourger the scourged, he might
himself be the tied up to the tripod. Which was
not a pleasant thing to contemplate. And—so—
and so
Even Fanny Cockburn, concubine -in - chief,
clapped her hands to her ears as “Eight!’’was
tallied, and “ Nine !” was tallied, and the tally of
ten was called.
* # *
The doctor was by no means satisfied that
the second, and final, tally of ten was as well-
executed or not—as the first. He was satisfied
that the flogger had been “codgering,” and,
generally, making things easy for the floggee.
“ You’ve been codgering, Scourger !”
“ Beg parding, Doctor Dickson, I did me best,
s’elp me, sir ! Jest look at them stripes !” He
pointed with the cat-handle to a couple of weals
which thrust their vicious colour through the rent
.checks of the bodice. “ They all fell there, sir.
I ’adn’t no borders to mark ’er all hover, doctor.
Doctor Dickson was too old an officer to be
deceived by such reasoning. “Those are the
stripes of the first tally ? How do I know you hit
her the second tally at all ? You d d fellows
have almost as many tricks with the cat as you ve
had strokes with it yourselves.” ,
Ned protested his innocence of any design to
defraud the System. He called the Confidant and
other deities to witness he had “ ’it square•
Did they not hear the flesh “ sw-sw-oqge” at eacli
and every stroke? He would forfeit his soul
nay, even that precious privilege for which he had
oft bartered that perjured atom—his weekly dole
of ’baccy—if he could be proved to be speaKin o
falsely! i
Now, as in the nature of the case, the only
person present who could speak positively to tn
fidelitv of Wiry Ned’s performance was Jane ne ■
self; and as, on the same premises, Ja» e . L :™“

of her punishment, what was there to be cion

on prisoner Jane Applegarth, 25 lashes. (Signed) F. 13.
Rankes, Commandant.
The Muse of History occasionally makes slips.
The Harbour was a “ male ” penal settlement —no
women were supposed to be there; there is no
strictly official record of the women ever getting
there; no woman-transport was, in that en-
lightened day, held to be liable to flogging except
by the hand of woman ; and yet, in a
moment of forgetfulness, she permitted
this entry to be made by the hands of
the very wretch whoso peculiar interest it was
that the proceeding should be forgotten as soon as
perpetrated! Really, sometimes, the devil does
not take care of his own. And the Clean are not
always fo.
How the Wiry ’Un cursed those languishing
syes of the pretty Cockburn girl, which could see
so keenly, when he promptly followed Jane at the
triangles ! For the scourger, pro tern., had been
under his hands the month previous, and the
scourger, pro tern., had, oh, a remarkably good
memory, and such a lively vengeance !
“ There wasn't any funking over that dose, was
there, Ned ?’ laughingly interrogated the doctor,
is the flogger, pro tern., having gone leisurely
through Ned’s “dozen,” once more retired into
private life and the cell whence he had emerged
into temporary officialdom. .
“ No, sir. There wasn’t! Thank you, sir !”
“ Don't mention it, my man—you’re quite wel-
come !” And the doctor laughed at his own
aumour. Which wasn’t his humour at all; it was
Mr. D’Arcy Wentworth’s, of Old Sydney.
* # *
If Wiry Ned was nipped to the bones by
the cold air as he stood shirtless to receive his
punishment, it was not long before he was in a
position to warm himself— and Jane.
She had, upon her release from the triangles,
oeen permitted to stand unmolested for twenty
minutes or so - fo stand in the cold, biting atmos-
phere—to stand, with the agonised eyes of a dumb
animal in the trap—to stand, with cheeks that
now paled to the whiteness of the spumy surf,
and now flamed to the scarlet of the thin, red
line; and wait for what came next.
* * *
The brands were “next!” You will re-
member the settlement’s branding-irons? They
were
\ oii =
Heated in the tinsmith’s brazier, those irons, or
such of them as were necessary, were successively
impressed upon the gleaming white of her shoulders.
Above the welt that signified Ned’s devotion to
the duty of his scourgership, her flesh crinkled,
and crackled, and singed, as, with all the haste he
could, the Wiry Ned affixed first one iron and then
another till these outlines were marked on tho
outraged body :
W, 513.
Consider that the process took, for the “ W.,”
four stampings; for the “5,” three stampings;
and should have taken for the other figures one
and two respectively. And consider, further,
that the Wiry ’Un made a mistake in impressing
the “1,” because he took up the shorter iron
instead of the longer, and thus had to repeat the
stamp to make the height of the figures uniform.
Consider these things, and also the circumstance
that even at Macquarie Harbour branding with
hot irons was an “unusual” punishment, and
that, therefore, Ned was not an expert, and you
will not be surprised to learn that the last brand
burnt into a body that was nearer death than life.
Still, the decision of the Law had to be respected.
* * #
It was in 1878 that a Hobart Town convict,
under sentence of life-imprisonment, sketched for
us on the whitewash of his cell-wall, the rude out-
lines of the Harbour brands, and told us, in
garnished phrase, the gist of the story of Jane
Applegarth, woman-transport. We doubted him
at the time ; although he could neither read nor
write; we doubted him (your convict truth-
speaker was generally an illiterate); only when,
years afterwards, we bought, in the old bookshop
opposite the ship Jane, Hobart-town, a dim,
stained manuscript bearing an autograph yet to be
esteemed precious in our Australian archives, did
we recall the prisoner’s story, and believe it.
And the letter “W” on Jane Apple-
garth’s flesh ? Cannot you guess why Com-
mandant Bankes stamped her with that supreme,
that indelible insult ? It was because she was the
only woman at the Settlement who did not
deserve it!
And Jane Applegarth herself? We told you; a
week or two ago, what happened to her and to
Bankes, when, after her torture, he caused her
to be removed to Limeburners’ Point —to the hut
—and the embraces —of the lime-gang. We have
reason to think she met Fanny Cockburn in later
life, under very different circumstances.

even when the State is benefiting them, it is an-
nounced that in connection with a recently-
authorised N.S.W. railway, 52 claims were pre-
sented to Government for resumed land
amounting to £30,000. The amount ultimately
awarded was only £5OOO !
No, the exiled Russian Jews must not
come in a mob to Australia, which country recog-
nises that its urban population is already hugely
in excess of its rural. No further immigration of
the artisan class even is desirable. One salutary
lesson the Jews might teach the Australian work-
men—how to stick together.
Squatter Palmer, in retiring from the
Queensland Acting-Governorship eulogises the
services of the military in re the present labour
troubles. Squatter Palmer lately swore that he
could not ride round his estate in three days, or
eight days, or something. Under the circum-
stances, it is easy to enthuse about the military.
At the banquet given by the Ballarat
Trades and Labour Council to the labour
delegates, when the toast of “the Queen ” was pro-
posed, about 40 of the visitors remained seated.
When the toasters sat down, Delegate Macdonald,
of Queensland, leaped on his chair, and shouted
‘Not the Queen, the People!” and carried the
crowd with him.
The British Commons are expected to dis-
solve shortly. Is England going once more to
justify 7, Bisn arck’s saying, that there is a complete
veer round of the political weathercock every six
years : Gladstone 18G8—74, Disraeli 1874 —80,
Gladstone 1880—6, Salisbury 1886—92? Of course
it is Liberalism that gains, with what Christopher
North calls the “spangs” of the tiger.
Sydney will not be the federal Capital
of the Commonwealth. Tasmania, South Aus-
tralia and Victoria would vote for Melbourne ;
Queensland and N.S. Wales for Sydney. It could
be claimed no doubt that Sydney, in time to come,
with the development of Northern and Western
Australia, would be the most central large city.
But then, you see, “ the time to come ’ has not yet
arrived.
Peacock ana Kirton, two members of the
Victorian Native party, accompanied the Female
Suffrage deputation that waited upon Premier
Munro last week. The young men and matured
married women seem warmer than the old men
and maidens on this great question. This is un-
fortunate. As the young men take wives and
grow old the maidens will become married and
matured, thus preserving the balance of opinion
as at present.
The Pope’s latest encyclical on the labour
question “ denounces excessive capitalistic de-
mands and the unjust claims of the Socialists,
and holds that the strained relations between
capital and labour throughout Europe demand
State intervention, otherwise the labour problem
will remain for ever unsolved. Leo partially
grasps the situation. The labour party, by their
action in preparing for fair representation in the
legislatures, are now busy in arranging that the
State sha 1 l interfere.
We read that “Northumberland (N.fcl.W.)
is to have two working labour candidates nomin-
ated next election, and consequently there will be
a severe fight, as the three present members,
Messrs. Melville, Walker, and Greer will stand.”
The Labour Party can easily do without Mr. Joey
Greer, but The Bulletin would advise it to care-
fully consider the expedient of withdrawing sup-
port from Melville and Walker, who, so far as we
know, have been absolutely straight on all demo-
cratic questions.
From the Age (last week) :
In a letter received by a Presbyterian clergyman at
Ballarat from the private secretary of the Governor it is
stated that his Excellency will not be influenced by the
petition which is being prepared in favour of the con-
demned man, Johnston, and that the execution will
accordingly be allowed to take place on the date fixed.
That a Governor’s private secretary should write
such a letter is almost incredible, considering that
the Governor personally is the final court of
appeal, and that the Imperial instructions to
him are to hear the advice of his Ministers
but to act on his omi responsibility alone. The
Governor is never at liberty, until a criminal has
been hanged, to say that he is beyond the reach of
argument respecting the condainne’s case.
Dear Bulletin, —Allow me to make a
suggestion with regard to the future Federal
Capital of Australia. To avoid any jealousy or
ill-feeling between the peoples of existing towns
or cities, let us build the Capital in the wilderness
in a position picturesque and grand. Let it be a
dream of architectural beauty worthy of our
glorious country. It should be a model for future
surveyors and builders of cities, as we hope to
show the way to the nations in progressive and
enlightened legislation. As a balm to Repub-
lican feeling, as an incentive to rnaniy and noble
actions, and as a tribute of respect to the memory
of our most earnest and practical patriot, let us
call it—What? — Yours, Orb. Oakleigh, Vic.
Extract, Sec. 8, U.S.A. Constitution,
Article 1 to bo read in connection with our first
leading-article of to-day :
The Congress shall have power—
To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of
money to that use shall be for a longer term than two
years.
To provide and maintain a navy.
To make rules for the Government and regulation of
the land and naval forces.
To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the
laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel in-
vasions.
To provide for organising, arming, and disciplining the
militia, and for governing such parts of them as may be
employed in the service of the United States, reserving to
the States respectively the appointment of the officers, and
the authority of training the militia according to the dis-
cipline pi'escribed by Congress.
1 he flock of Melbourne ladies who flut-
tered round Jimmy Munro and chirped for the
suffrage was unable to keep off the grovel paths.
References to the revered occupant of the British
Throne crop up wherever a few petticoats are
gathered together, and the awful “loyalty ” of the
advanced female always manages to assert itself
somehow. One of James’ petitioners said that
“ woman’s capability intellectually was provf d by
her now having a position among doctors, lawyers,
pastors; by her university degrees, and by her
reigning in grace and wisdom as Queen of the
realm.” This last reason for giving votes to the
fair sex is sweetly illogical, because British
Queens date back to the days of Boadicea, and
there was a Bloody Mary at the head of affairs
at a time when women knew as much about
the law and senior wranglerships as a cow knows
about cannon-balls.
Premier Munro last week told a deputa-
tion who advocated woman-franchise, that “if the
extension were limited to rate-payers there would
be very little difficulty.” Delicious, this! A
lurid light is hero cast upon the real political con-
victions of the democratic Munro, one of the
makers of the Commonwealth Bill. He favours
one-man-one-vote, which lie sees is inevitable,
and yet he talks with complacency of set-
ting up another Tory class —of proper-
tied and well-to do women. The woman who
has to earn her own living comparatively rarely
has uroperty or pays rates. Wo are going
to have one-man-one-vote shortly and when
woman-suffrage comes along we shall enfranchise
every woman over the age of 21 years, whether she
be a retired publicaness, living in gilded splendour
at Toorak or Potts’ Point, or a twister in a tobacco-
factory. The Lord defend ns against a female
politically-privileged class !

“George Atkinson” writes to Sydney
D.T., apropos to the verdict passed upon the
“Young Lady of the Period” by Mark Guy
Pearse :
If I had been at Mr. Pearse’s lecture he would have
been instantly challenged by myself to produce in Eng-
land or elsewhere five females more competent in all
household duties than my own five daughters, born in
Sydney city.
After this good reclame, the end of the five Misses
Atkinson, as Misses, should not bo far off. It is
not often a man has such a chance of directly
advertising his gals. What price this style ?
-> * #
Amoosin’ little paragraph :
Lady Parkes, who has been indisposed for some days,
was slightly better yesterday. Lord Jersey on hearing
of her ladyship’s illness forwarded a letter of sympathy
to Sir Henry Parkes.
Either Old Man Parkes or Governor Jersey is a
better and more persistent advertiser than even
Mr. Atkinson. Apropos, which of the pair is the
awful snob who communicates such items to the
press !
* # *
have read the latest volume of Austra-
lian stories by the literary wives of several literary
men. _ The worst of the yarns is that they all seem
to be in the style of the ladies’ husbands.

It is whispered that a Sydney medico,
professionally acquainted with about half the
young men of N.S. Wales, is coming out on abso-
lutely democratic lines at next general election.
* * *
The election of Fitzgibbon to the Chair-
manship of the new Melbourne Board of Works
is a great blow to the Sir M. H. Davies’ clique,
whose nominee, Muntz, brother of the Birming-
ham Muntz, considered his selection cocksure,
thanks to the ramifications, pecuniary and social,
of Speaker and Syndicator Davies. Muntz was
one of Davies’ colleagues (lots of people use a
less complimentary term) in Prahran “City”
Council, which was the second stage —the first
was the Y.M.C.A. —to Davies’ “honours.” Be-
tween the Munro-Building-Sooiety-and-Banking-
clique and the Davies’ ditto-ditto-ditto there is a
bitter feud, all the stronger that it is disguised
’neath the brotherly love of the Saints, The
opportunity given to the Munro crowd of bestow-
ing a back-hander on the Speaker’s crew, per
medium of nonsensical old Fitz., was, therefore,
not to be lost by any means.
« * #
A particularly strong man was wanted for
the Chairmanship of a Metropolitan Board of
Works in Melbourne—and poor old Fitzgibbon’s
nomination has been made in utter disregard of
the public need. There could be little doubt that
the appointment of the bumptious boss of the
Melbourne City Council is a sop to the city
proper, and is a step which cannot help (Fitz.’s
antecedent views of suburban municipalities
being borne in mind) but prove disastrous to the
development of the outlying suburbs. The
appointment is a radically bad one. Fitz. has
seen his best days and done his best work long
ago, and as the executive action of the new Board
will rest mainly with him, the suburban members
will, from the outset, have to waste their time and
energy in fighting Fitz. ’s ineradicable tendency to
build up a monstrous centralisation, instead of
concentrating both on the work of the Board.

A Maoriland young lady was engaged to .
an apparently prosperous manufacturer in another
city, when, a few days before the date fixed for
their marriage, news was received that his firm
had become insolvent. A letter was at once
written and posted to the allegedly penniless
Romeo breaking the match off, but, ere the mail
had left, a telegram arrived from a relative stating
that rumour had lied. The weeping maid and her
parents swooped down on the post-office demand-
ing the letter’s return, but the official rule
admitted of no exception, and now the- blighted
bride is biting her lips, while the saved lover is
thanking his stars for a lucky escape.

We cannot help smiling when we read of
a certain N.S. W. Stipendiary giving six months’
to an habitual drunkard.

Quack doctors, remarks a talented Bul-
letin man, are so called because they make all

The Melbourne Corporation is beginning
to recognise that one of the sexes, at all events —
Man —is subject to depletion as well as absorption.
As for the poor women, it is this way : Byron
could not bear to see them eat or drink, and other
people will not believe they do anything else.

A dozen Chinese laundries can now be
counted in Melbourne. One Chow has his work-
shop in Russell-street in the front room of what
used to be a private house, and a gaping crowd
can generally be seen roaring with laughter at
John as he irons the shirts and flattens out the
women’s underwear.
Apropos , a squatter who, with his wife and
family, came down for a trip to Melbourne, put
up at a swell city hotel and entered upon the
pursuit of mild enjoyment. Passing down
Russell-street one evening, en route for the
Alexandra, the husband and wife were astonished
to hear the lady’s full name derisively shouted out
by a crowd of larrikins congregated round a
dimly-lighted window. Pushing towards the
tenement, and peering through the dirty gauze
curtains, the lord of several thousand head of
stock beheld a sprightly young Chinaman in full
dress, and cigarette en louche, hanging up a petti-
coat which certainly belonged to “the missus,”
and which he had evidently just ironed. He
then, with a grin, proceeded to grab a white vest
of the in-gazer’s, whereupon the alert mob once
more burst into a Greek chorus, while his wife
straggled frantically to obtain a view of the busi-
ness. Without a word of explanation the unhappy
man tore her away and hustled her home. An
alteration in the hotel laundry-department has
since been effected.
* * *
Dr. Bride, Melbourne Public Librarian,
was among the slain in the contest for the Chair-
manship of the Melbourne Board of Works. His
candidature was a marvel to many people, as he
was looked upon as a scholar, pure and simple,
whose heart was a bibliographical treatise,
delicately bound in superfine Russia, French-
tooled, gilt over red edges. The proceeding, how-
ever, is no surprise to those who know what Bride
has had to contend with, between his trustees on
the one hand, and the Public Service Commis-
sioners on the other. In the preparation of his
admirably-devised card-catalogue, which pro-
mises to be the superlative work of the kind

FINE ART.
A RTIST: “Good morning, but you have not brought your theatrical costume."
M ODEL: “Oh, yes; I have it here.”
thus we bar the Mercantile Library of New York
—he has had the assistance of practically nobody
except a lot of untrained cubs whose knowledge
of literature is made up by Matriculation papers,
“Jack Harkaway,” and “The Bold Bandit of
Bugaboo.” The principal assistants of the Insti-
tution, Dr. Gagliardi, Bowden, 8.A., Armstrong,
8.A., have their time monopolised in the work of
supervision in their several departments, and the
cataloguing, which should have given results of
importance to the whole world of book-lovers, has
been only saved from becoming a mere compila-
tion on the plan of booksellers’ lists by Bride’s love
for and devotion to his work.

The recently-cabled news that the detach-
ment of Victorian Mounted Rifles who have gone
to the English tournament are to be quartered
with the Life Guards at Windsor, is being much
gushed over in the Melbourne papers. To be
quartered with the Royal bodyguard may please
the Victorian Mounted Rifles and Co., but the
Australian democracy regards the alleged com-
pliment with supreme indifference. It views the.
class who now control the Australian military as
the sworn enemies of the people, and will make
things hot for them when Big Black Wednesday
comes along.

“ The Prince of Wales is practically bank-
rupt, and the Queen has arranged to liquidate his
debts, provision being made for a regular allow-
ance to the Duke of Clarence and Avondale.”—
(Cable .)
The appointment of Mr. Holtzeas Director
of Adelaide Botanic Gardens at £450 per annum
is another instance of relentless cutting-down in
the S.A. Civil Service. The late Dr. Schomburgk
received £6OO for the work, but in order to save
£l5O per annum the Government slices the position
down to a second-hand billet—and at the same
time agree to pay the picnic expenses of a so-
called ‘ * expedition ” by a notoriety-hunting
Governor.
* * *
It was made abundantly evident at the
cricket-match played on the Rushcutters’ Bay
Oval, Sydney, between the I. Zingari and
The Fleet that ladies don’t care a dump
for cricket. From the start they stood with
their umbrageous hats and parasols, and that
charming disregard for manners and other
folks’ convenience, which is woman’s prerogative,
in front of the males who were eager to watch the
game. Towards the close of the afternoon there
were several hundred ladies and not a few gentle-
men congregated in the vicinity of the vice-regal
carpet inside the playing ground, and it is safe to
say that not ten of them had an eye to the game
for a single moment. As Lord Jersey and
Admiral Scott scored three each the question of
precedence may be supposed to remain unsettled
in the latter gentleman’s opinion. Bishop
Saumaurez Smith was in attendance, giving His
Ex. a few points about bo vling. It was suggested
that the Bishop of Yorker would be a good title
for a man of his cricketing attainments.
* * *
The monomaniac, Wilson, hanged on Mon-
day for an offence that is no longer punishable by
death “at home,” spent the last fortnight of Ids
life in shrieking, groaning, and beating his head
against the walls of his cell in Ballarat-gaol. The
man’s hopeless lunacy was patent to all th<
officials, who would have regarded the “ turninj
off ” of paralytic Johnston from a stool as a
pleasant spectacle by comparison.
# # *
Another expensive, full-orchestra wedding
at Melbourne Anglican Cathedral is in the wind"
Next time there will be a strong body of police
engaged to protect the pot-plants and watch ovei
the prodigal display of cut blossoms. Any Toorak
lady who breaks through the line of defence, and
attempts to carry off a five-guinea orchid undet
cover of a haughty stare, will run a risk of arrest
by one of the plain-clothes officers stationed at
discreet distances within the sacred building.
Several Melbourne florists are fearful of lending
pot-plants on these occasions. They say that a
wedding gets the ladies’ blood up and that when
the female aristocracy do get their first-family
blood fairly up they will grab at anything.
* # #
A story of a very staid and solemn Aus-
tralian M.P. has been given us. Domestic dissen-
sions, mere or less serious, had determined the
“guid wife ” to leave the connubial home, and in
order to prepare for the journey she secured 500
sovereigns and placed them in charge of a feminine
friend. Husband and wife, however, made up
their little differences and agreed to wade through
the balance of life together. The wife immediately
waited upon the “friend,” who, however, had by
some extraordinary lapse of memory forgotten all
about the £5OO, and her memory has continued a
blank to this day. But a certain pub. in an inland
town had a new storey put on it, and the landlady
thereof flourishes.

Rumoured that Yerdi is composing a new
song for Melba, enshrining her birthplace with—
O Marvello Stinkopolo !

To give an idea of the interest felt in Sir
John Robertson’s funeral, it may be mentioned
that there were perhaps as many lookers-on as at
the funeral of Searle,
* * *
It is safe to prophesy that the cold trip at
Sir John Robertson’s funeral will shorten the
days of some of the old men in the procession.
Some took their after-dinner naps in public view,
some smoked, but the majority shivered.

Raise a statue to Sir John Robertson !
Bah ! Pay for tiie monuments you have already
raised, lest bluff old Jack return and kick you.

Lecturing to the N.S.W. Ambulance
Society, before Lady Jersey, Dr. Ellis started off—
“ Since Lady Brassey has come amongst us .”
“ Same old speech !” interjected someone, and it
evidently was the speech delivered when that now
deceased lady founded the society. The mistake
somewhat broke the doctor up, and his equani-
mity was not improved by the sotto voce remark of a
lady who said : “ So like a medical man to resur-
rectpoor Lady Brassey !” Moral : Editing is a
profession.
* * #
In Hay, N.S.W., there is or was a custom
among “the talent” of whistling “Pop goes the
Weasel” whenever anyoneon horseback proceeded
up or down the street, and the police have had
some of the young gentlemen fined for doing so
under the charge of “insulting behaviour.’ A
correspondent asks The Bulletin whether this is
law or merely bush law, and whether a person
can be given in charge for whistling it or any
other air; also if there is no appeal in law against
such a decision. In reply we can only say that if
such whistling is locally regarded as insulting it
is insulting and is punishable by law.

The N.S. Wales Presbyterian Assembly
publicly plume themselves on the good work done
by the church among the Sydney Chinese. Dr.
Andrew Ross, M.P., points out that in two of the
largest and oldest-settled counties of N.S.W. with
a population of 8000 souls, not a single Pres-
byterian clergyman is on hand to baptise, marry,
or even read the burial service. Molong, the
largest town of his constituency, has a neat Pres-
byterian church but no parson, and the people are
thinking of turning it into a skating-rink.

Mary Sharpies, of Northcote, in the com-
petition for the prize for the prettiest child at Mel-
bourne Baby Show, scored 456 votes ; her nearest
competitor only got 171. After all, there must be
some points about a baby. We never could see
any. All babies look the same to us, just as do
all monkeys, Chinamen, and green peas.

Crime is on the decrease to a remarkable
extent in South Australia. Naracoorte Circuit
Court, held twice a year, has only had one case
since October, 1889—eighteen months ! Sir George
Grey said to the writer that Adelaide was the
first Australian city he had visited where he had
not been accosted by a beggar.

Fitzgibbon is concluding his long reign
as Town Clerk with amusing onslaughts upon
the Early Closing Act. Fitzgibbon is at
least consistent in his generation. He has ever
been the champion of reserves and open places for
the people, and on the principle that shops are
some people’s places, he would keep them all open
until 10 p.m., anyway.
The coming K.’s mama, they state,
In spite of all estrangements
To wipe his scores from off the slate,
At last has made arrangements.
As bright and shining as a star
Our Albert Edward’s face is
For he can play at baccarat
Upon a firmer basis.
He’s not afraid of heavy bets,
He doesn’t fear the draper,
Nor settle incidental debts
With little bits of paper;
The “dicky ” dukes lie couldn’t snub
Regard him now with shyness,
And Hirsch’s shoulder mustn’t rub
The shoulder of His Highness.
E’en Tummy’s tailor breathes again ;
His jeweller grows frisky,
No more he looks with silent pain
At orders that were risky ;
The butcher’s visage doesn't drop
Because he has to trust ’em,
He never crys—“ The other shop
Can ’ave their bloomin’ custom ! ”
A fact is fact, in prose or verse,
And princes (who will doubt it?)
Can do, with money in the purse,
What none can do without it.
An Heir Apparent to the Crown,
Though fairly “ wide ” and knowing,
Gets better served for money down
Than when he leaves it owing.
So, blessings on the Royal Vic.
(Whose praises all the toffs sing),
She doesn’t like us giving tick
To any of her offspring.
She’ll settle Tummy’s debts herself,
To stop the people’s chatter,
And, as they find her royal pelf,
There isn’t much the matter.

Providence, as a rule, maintains a moral
average in humanity by supplying good wives
with bad husbands, and vice versa. Good women
love men for their faults, whilst bad, tricky
charmers lay themselves out for the respectable
Jugginses, the result being children of medium
quality. This proverb has been in the like
Federation, ever since our first parents left Eden,
but it remained for The Bulletin to establish it
on earth. And, by the way, the liking of the bad
man for the other fellow’s wife is always counter-
balanced by the good woman’s scorn for the other
creature’s husband.

Candidates for the Marlborough Club, to
which Irving was recently admitted, arc either
the nominees of Tummy or must be approved by
him before they are balloted for. The usual cus-
tom is to submit three names to the bald-headed
magnate. If he votes for one of the trio, the
favoured individual is elected as a matter of
course, but if Tummy neither votes nor scowls
ominously, then all three are put up, and the one
who finds most friends among the common or
garden kind of members gets the billet. There is
no “ pilling,” apparently.

Dr. Burke-Gaffney, of Bendigo, has been
sharply upbraided by a newspaper correspondent
through having two addresses to deliver on a cer-
tain night lately, one of them before a Sandhurst
branch of the A.N.A., the other before a football
club and giving preference to the football-club. It
would have been curious had he failed to do so.
Wo take it that he is a surgeon.

A Melbourne paper, mentioning that the
Mayoress of Oollingwood had been presented
with a silver cradle, went on to say that “the
lady Mayoress responded in suitable terms.”
Gentlemen mayoresses being unknown in these
parts, it is difficult to understand why the recipient
of the gorgeous baby-bunk should be distinguished
by the prefix “lady,” unless it was intended as a
special tribute to her superior breeding. One
might, with more justification, pitch a yarn about
the lady Countess of Jersey desiring her lady
heiress to run away and be good with the lady
governess.
* *
Dr. Strachan, in the Westminster Review,
states that consanguineous marriages are in
all cases nocuous, and must ever prove so in an
increased degree as civilisation proceeds. This is
untrue. In-breeding aggravates existing deformi-
ties, but augments established excellencies. The
subject is a complicated one, but for a rough-and-
ready rule the above is unchallengeable, remarks
“ Junor ” in a Southern paper.

The girl-clerks at Melbourne G.P.O. are
so confused by the recent open-counter innovation
of Postmaster-General Duffy that they can’t sort
out their letters half so fast as formerly. This is
tiardly to be wondered at when you consider the
[earful stare of the remittance-men who cluster
round on the arrival of each British mail.

Spagnoletti : —Saw a man in rags, in Mel-
bourne, to-day—haven’t seen such a thing—
there—for years. In the past a ragged man
walked the Block every day—a well-known Solon
Shingle sort of party, in a sun-baked suit, but he
took this means of annoying his old acquaintances,
for he was once a merchant on ’Change, and even
after the rags he recuperated once more into whole
clobber.

The vast and unprecedented number of

With the Queen’s'Birthday* at hand, one
wonders if Premier Parkes is going to dine the
Vernon reformatory-ship boys again. An amusing
anecdote has survived of the last feed he gave
them. After swallowing a plate of soup, three
plates of roast beef, six enormous potatoes, half a
plum-pudding, and as much fruit as you could
cram into an ordinary Chinaman’s basket, one
little chap, falling victim to a species of physio-
logical earthquake, addressed his diminutive
stomach in the following well-merited words of
contempt: “ TJmph ! so ye’re beginning to ache,
are ye! I’ll give you something to ache for
directly.” And accordingly passed his plate for
more.
There is a lot of food for thought in the
“Answers to Correspondents” in a fashion-
magazine. Here is a sample, quite typical of
srores of others addressed to more or less damaged
correspondents:—
Do not take potatoes, pastry, milk, cocoa, sugar, nor
coffee ; take plenty of out-door exercise, bathe frequently,
and practise with dumb-bell half-an-hour before break-
fast. It very stout try sea-wrack pills. (2) Take ’s
complexion-pilules. (3) You might try the use of
pumice-stone to remove superflous hair from your face.
(4) The redness is probably caused by indigestion. You
should not drink hot tea if it causes your nose to turn
red ; protect your nose from cold air ; take figs, prunes,
or oranges fasting ; wash your nose with very hot water
and apply the following lotion, &c. A piece of orris-root
held in the mouth will disguise bad breath. (5) lb is
impossible to reduce the size of the hands.
A correspondent like that is almost past repair.
She seems to suffer from nearly everything,
except that her feet aren’t mentioned, and nothing
is said about her ears standing straight out on
each side of her head. Any sane editor would tell
her to escape into a convent.

Over twelve months ago a man was arrested
in Newcastle (N.S.W.), for whose capture, so the
local police say, the firm from whom he had
embezzled, offered £5O; it is also claimed that
they promised to pay his captor 10 per cent, of
BROTHERS IN ARMS.
JONES: “John, are you,— hiC— superstitious— hic?— 'Cause my right ear’s—hic-burning some-
thing terri— hic— terrible!”
any money which might be found on him at the
time of arrest. The police say that the firm in
question appear to have forgotten their promise.

The old British nobility with the long-
pedigree —the nobility which wears a haughty
expression and two curly legs that go out at the
knees—is reported to be looking unusually seedy
this year. All the money is in the hands of the
new nobility, which is bow-legged instead of
knock-kneed, and short and fat, and which owns
public-houses, and banks, and property, and trades
in coal and beer, and similar things, and the old
dukes and earls look as if they were wearing their
last shirt. The scene outside Buckingham Palace
at the last royal function drew tears of abject misery
from the Argus’s society female, as she leaned up
against the gate and looked on the decadence of
Hingland. One stupendous flunkey, who drove a
duchess and her two bony daughters, wore a
bouquet made of three camellias and the paper
frill off a boiled ham, and instead of being a proper
flunkey he was a broken-nosed ruffian, evidently
cadged out of a coal-cart. Another peeress of high
degree had two coachmen, but they didn’t match
in point of size, and the correspondent felt that
the country was lost, for they were both smoking
short pipes. A third retainer got down and
hugged a girl from a public-house, while waiting
for his august lord to come out. Most of the
vehicles were one-horse traps of some sort or other,
and were obviously borrowed at 2s. 6d. an hour,
and the flunkeys, as a rule, were badly disguised
individuals from a livery stable or a gutter. There
was no deportment among them, no veneration,
no calves, and their clothes were a horrible misfit,
and they didn’t even know how to assist the
peeresses in or out ot the conveyance, but shoved
them as if they were sacks of beaus. Also, the
horses were a dispirited and broken-kneea lot ot
roarers, and the impression they all left behind
them was that the glory of the empire had de-
parted.

The Duchess of Albany’s father has just

the inevitable offspring of the union will be second
cousins to the sister-in-law of their step-sister,
likewise step-uncles and aunts to the grandchildren
of their mother’s cousin’s mother-in-law, besides a
lot of other things too numerous to mention, ine
giddy culprit, the Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont, is
G 1 years of age, and ought to know better than to
saddle Victoria Regina with another string o
mixed relations in her old age. All of which
reminds us that Sir Salmon Wilson, being
descended from Alfred the Great, is a sort ot dis-
tant connection of the Czar of Russia.

In London Divorce Court, in a case wherein
an Englishwoman applied for a divorce against
her drunken Irish husband, it was decided that
inasmuch as the standard of drunkeness was very
different in Ireland from what it was in England,
what might be called disgraceful insobriety in the
land of the Britisher need not be so considered in
the Emerald Isle. Decree refused accordingly.
Another injustice to Ireland !

It is currently rumoured that a certain
Adelaide paper gets many of its best leading
articles from the local Inebriate Asylum. We
always thought so.
The Goulburn (N.S.W.) Bench has refused
to take the evidence of Dr. Beytes, the Turkish
Consul for N.S.W., on the ground that he de-
clined to remove his skull-cap in court. The
doctor claims that, as he is a Mahommedan, to
take the oath with uncovered head would be
against his conscience and against his caste. He
has complained to the Department of Justice,
which, the facts being as stated, should certainly
see that the Bench apologises for a piece of
very bad manners. We don’t suppose that the
Goulburn Bench is able to force a Hebrew to
swear with uncovered head.

Another Great Win!
AN INVALID FOE 12 YEAES.
Mrs, Fanny Dent, wife of a gentleman employed
in the Lambton Collieries, kindly allows us to
publish the following facts of her interesting case
and wonderful recovery, which we gather from
her correspondence, and which we shall be glad
to allow anyone to peruse who wishes to do so.
Mrs. Dent had been in a state of extreme
debility for twelve years, frequently quite unable
to do any work, the lightest kind causing great
fatigue, with severe pains in the limbs, back and
left side. So severe was the pain that she would
have to sit or lie down frequently. Walking
exercise was very trying and site could only walk
very slowly. She had long seen Clements Tonic
advertised, but like many more people her husband
was prejudiced against “patent medicines,” but
(now we use her own words) “ I knew' some one
who had tried Clements Tonic, and I decided to
get a bottle on the quiet and say nothing about it
if it did me no good. The effect I thought some-
thing wonderful. I felt better after the first dose,
and by the time I had taken half a bottle I was a
different woman. My husband, friends and
neighbours soon noticed the change in me, and
they could not make it out. I had to tell the
truth that it was Clements Tonic that was making
me strong, I could not keep the secret, I was only
too glad to give the credit to Clements Tonic.
After finishing the bottle, work was no trouble
to me, but rather a pleasure, and after doing a
heavy day’s washing I could go for a walk instead
of having to go to bed, as always happened before
taking Clements Tonic. One of my neighbours
said to me last week, ‘ Why Mrs. Dent, you are
doing wonders this week, how is it you are so
strong now ? ’ She knew I had done more that
week than I had been able to do in 12 years before
(she had known me this time, for I am an old
resident of this locality, having lived here for 15
years.) I replied, ‘Yes, I feel a wonder to my-
self, so I’ll tell you the secret, I have been taking
Clements Tonic, and I cannot tell you the benefit
I have derived from it. You know what my
sufferings have been and now I have a genuine
taste of good health.’”
Mrs. Dent wrote us those particulars of her
remarkable cure in March. She wisely, however,
decided to continue the medicine to “clinch the
cure ”as it were. Some time afterwards she wrote
as follows :
Waratah Commonage, N.S.W.
Dear Sir, —It is with great pleasure that I pen
these few lines. I have been as you know a great
sufferer from weakness and debility for years. I
was under several doctors, but they never did any
good- I despaired of ever being better, but as I
stated in my last letter I saw Clements Tonic
advertised. I tried a bottle and its effect was
something wonderful. I felt better almost imme-
diately, and was a new woman after finishing the
first bottle. Before taking Clements Tonic it was
a great trouble even to do a little house-work, but
afterwards my work was a pleasure and my
friends and neighbours were surprised at the
change in me. I cannot say too much in praise of
it, and can only gratefully describe my case and
strongly advise all who suffer from weakness,
backache, pain in the side, ringing noises in the
ears and shortness of breath to take Clements
Tonic. I feel sure it will do them as much good
as it has done me.
Yours Gratefully,
Fanny Dent.
We have great pleasure in thanking this lady
for allowing us to publish the case. We con-
stantly hear of similar ones which people object
to have published through a false delicacy. We
only want to publish them in the interests of
suffering humanity. Surely it is not wrong for
people to acknowledge the genuineness and relia-
bility of an article, when they have proved it to
possess the properties we claim for it,
Consumption and the “Microbe Killer.”
Radam’s Microbe Killer Co. Gentlemen,—l
think it only right to let you know I am getting
on with your great remedy, the Microbe Killer,
and the great benefit that I have received from its
use. Having suffered for some time past from
bad hemorrhage, night sweats, and pneumonia,
the doctors said my lungs were in a very bad
state. I got very much alarmed as I lost a large
quantity of blood, and, like a drowning man
catching at a straw, I tried many remedies, but
with little success. A friend of mine knowing
how ill I had been, advised me to try the Microbe
Killer. I did so, and I am thankful to God, that
I did. After taking the Microbe Killer for about
a fortnight it made me feel very sick, but after-
wards I began to improve. I have now taken
four jars of "the Microbe Killer - two of No. 1, and
two of No. 2—with the result that my appetite has
improved, the night sweats have stopped and I
have had no more hemorrhage, and my health
has greatly improved, and I hope by God’s bles-
sing through the use of your great remedy, that I
shall soon be restored to my usual health and
strength again. I hope that I shall still have
better news to tell you later on. Gentlemen, I
write these few lines for the benefit of the suffer-
ing, believing that if they will give it a fair trial
it will restore them to health. Yours respectfully,

A Victorian non-unionist has written to
the Government suggesting that executioner Jones
should be sacked as he—-the writer —is willing to
do the strangulation and flogging at a reduced
rate. This is the ancient trouble—we are ruined
by cheap Welsh hanging and unprincipled blackleg
execution, and the same unhappy tendency to
sacrifice efficiency to mere economy, which has
already ruined so many promising industries,
threatens to invade this one also. Hitherto it has
been the recognised axiom that the thoroughness
and open-hearted lavishness of the flogging and
scragging business was more to be considered than
questions of mere finance, and when the Anglo-
Saxon race begins to go back on this great rule the
empire will be on the downward track. It is to
be hoped that the Victorian Government recog-
nises this fact, and will repulse the cheap applicant
with scorn. To do otherwise would be to east a
slur on the present energetic and painstaking
hangman, and then he would probably begin to
lose interest in his work, and wouldn’t fix the
knot under the left ear with his old enthusiasm.
Even a hangman has feelings, and when that
conscientious officer comes home at night, and
hangs up the noose in the boudoir, and stows
away the cat among the family archives, he should
be able to reflect that his country is not ungrateful
for his efforts. And when he is off duty, in a
manner of speaking, and resting peacefully on the
lawn among the overshadowing trees, while his
son and heir is playfully hanging the infant on
the knob of the front door, and his blue-eyed
daughter is passing sentence of death on the
kitten, or ordering the nurse to receive fifty lashes
and then be imprisoned with hard labour for the
term of her natural life, it is ungenerous that his
comfort should be marred by the fear that a cheap
scab executioner may presently jump his billet.
And when he dies in the fulness of years he
should be able to hand an unblemished gallows
down to his posterity, and if he be compelled, by
unprincipled competition, to hang below tariff
rates it is obvious he can’t do that, and must
perish miserably without even his own self-respect
to sustain him in his last hours. The writer of
this paragraph tried to end with a poem, but as
the nearest rhyme he could get for “hangman”
was “bang him” it has been held over for
farther consideration.

EVERY HOUSEHOLD—especially where
there are young cnilclren—should be provided
with Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the prompt use of
which has saved innumerable lives. Its effect
is immediate and certain. It stops coughing, pro-
motes expectoration, and soothes the irritated
membrane. The most famous and successful
Cough-Cure
in the world, it has no equal as a remedy for
asthma, bronchitis, inflamed tonsils, loss of
voice, whooping-cough, croup, and the sudden
pulmonary complaints to which children are
liable. Taken in the early stages of consump-
tion, it often cures that disease and always
checks its progress; and even at a later period
In the malady, it relieves the distressing cough
and induces needful repose. A safe, palatable,
and economical medicine, Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral should be always at hand in case of an un»
foreseen and sudden emergency.

Brown’s Buck.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Billy Brown is a Bogalong digger,
He has “followed the game up ” for years,
But his pile hasn’t grown any bigger,
And his luck would just move you to tears—
He has bottomed more duffers than any
Who have tackled the shovel and pick,
Since twenty-five years ago, when he
Went prospecting with Pigeon-toed Mick.
He has worked till he couldn’t be colder,
Belly-deep in the wettest of sludge,
But to find his way stopped by a boulder
That a dynamite-bomb wouldn’t budge;
Through both hard and soft sinking lie’s driven,
He has belted with hammer and gad ;
He has blasted, and sweated, and striven,
But his luck’s been invariably bad.
So it seemed, t’other day, quite surprising
That old Brown had, at last, a “ good thing,”
When he sold out a claim, realising
Just a tenner—’twas all it would bring.
In that claim he’d been sinking and sloping,
There were drives going through it all ways—
Till old Brown, in despair, gave up hoping
To be able to say—“ My claim pays.”
’Twas a claim a man’s feelings to harrow,
For the ground was the hardest about,
And the wash was but poor stuff and narrow—
She had “pinched,” and was near “duffered
out.”
So Brown jumped at the chance of resigning
All his right to the “ Enterprise ” block
To three “mugs ” who knew nothing of mining—
Men who couldn’t tell felspar from rock !
They had come from “the old country,” thinking
They would pile up a fortune with ease;
They knew less than a child about sinking
(They had not worn the skin off their knees !).
On the subjects of “ground,” “lodes,” “forma-
tion,”
They were just about equally wise :
Which accounts for this fool combination
Giving “ten ” for the old “Enterprise.”
And old Bill softly murmured—“ They’re had
‘ some,’
By-and-bye they will cuss it and me !”
And he straightway embarked on a gladsome
And a wildly hilarious spree.
And he bragged, till to listen was painful,
Of his deal he unceasingly jawed ;
And his words were sarcastic, disdainful.
“ Wish ’em joy of the bloominold fraud ! ”
But an end came at last, to the gladness
Of the man who had sold out his claim,
From the pub. he was fired out in sadness,
With not even a cent to his name.
He had “boozed up ” the whole of his ready,
He was sick from the rums he had quaffed,
As he zigzagged, with footsteps unsteady,
To the sold-out old “Enterprise ” shaft.
At the claim they were busily working,
And a whip horse was hauling out stuff
Just as fast as he could do—no shirking—
And at that wasn’t half quick enough !
For the men on the forty-foot level,
Had just only to shovel it in,
And they cussed that slow horse like the devil—
More than half of the stuff ivas pure tin !
’Twas explained to old Brown :—“We intended
To go on where you’d driven before;
So began at the place where you ended,
And drove her ’bout thirteen feet morej
And she opened out wider an’ wider,
Just as nice as could possibly be !
And there’s ever so much more inside her,
Would you like to go under and see ? ”
Thus those mugs made the greatest of “ splashes ”
There’s been nothing to equal it since—
And they now cut the biggest of dashes
(It is said one’s on terms with a Prince !)
If you search the swell newspapers’ pages,
You will see them named line after line;
And old Brown is now ivorking for 'wages,
T n the world-famous Enterprise mine!

Allen, and Allen, in a Melbourne letter, calls him
“one of the three greatest men in England.”
“Scratch,” &o.
The tallest public men about Melbourne
are Joe Symes, Panton and M‘Kean. Though
these people have all very long bodies, two of
them have very short minds.
Thus Andrew Lang : “In Stevenson the
striking quality is the buoyancy, the survival of
the child in him ; in Kipling, the swift and cer-
tain vision, his certainty in effects.”
Frank Stuart, by joining the Government
in a “no portfolio” capacity, became entitled to
a free-pass on the Victorian railways for life.
That's worth getting, in these hard times.
Acting-Governor Judge Boucaut (S.A.)
came in for £15,000 as son-in-law of the late Alex.
M'Culloch. The Judge has relinquished his idea
of re-entering politics, and will probably go in for
yachting.
They say that when Sir William Gordon"
Gumming brings his baccarat-scandal to court, h e
will be non-suited, on a technical point, before
Tummy and his friends can be put into the
witness-box.
Archbishop Carr (R.C.), of Melbourne,
quite abjures the dignity affected by Archbishop
Goold, billing himself simply as “T. J. Carr
D.D.,” and signing himself “ T. J. Carr,” instead
of “T. Melbourne.”
The late Charles Bradlaugh was once in
communication with R. S. Smythe for an Austra-
lian lecturing tour. If the Much-Travelled could
have brought him to terms, the great Liberator
might have been alive to-day.
Mooshouse has another chance for the
York Archbishopric, through Magee’s death.
Fancy Moorhouse’s excitement when he heard
the shocking news—why are such temptations
placed before poor human frailty ?
Mr, F. W. Ward, late editor of Sydney
Daily Telegraph and formerly editor of Sydney
Echo, goes to England to act as cable-agent for a
big Australian press combination, taking with him
the cordial goodwill of all pressmen.
Sir George Grey ; “ Broken Hill is the
eighth wonder of the world ’’—this is dangerously
near the style in which Lady Bowen used to kiss
the blarney-stone in New Zealand —“Auckland
reminds me of my beautiful Isles of Greece.”
Turning up London Athenaeum for 1862,
one drops on the first notice of Kendall’s poems.
He sent them in MSS., being then only 20, and a
generous three-column notice was given. Very
different to the Quarterly Review on Keats.
Phil. May (who, by the way, has of late
been very ill) is to be art-editor of the new London
comic, Big Ben, it is said. It is to be in style
something between N.Y. Puck and Paris Figaro.
Four pages in colours, eight in black and white.
“Trickettand Hanlan,” says Dr. Benjamin
Ward Richardson, “are equally emphatic about
the injury inflicted by the use of narcotics and
stimulants.” The point of the moral lies in the
application thereof ; Trickett and Hanlan both
kept pubs.
“On the 21»t ulfc. Sir Henry Parkes
received a letter, signed ‘ Harry,’ intimating that
he would be killed on May 17. The identity of
‘Harry ’ is suspected, and a warrant for his arrest
has been issued.” Old Harry, probably. The
Kiama Ghost again.
A certain member of the Griffith Ministry,
recently asked by a party of Sunday-school
teachers if he did not think that a man like Par-
nell should be kicked out of Parliament, replied
with more than Ministerial honesty; “No, my
friends. Consider where I should be then.”
Moltke’s romance, romance of the steel-
faced man. His sister married Widower Burt
(English) with a daughter 16, who fell in love with
Moltke’s letters, though he was 40 ; they had 25
years of happy married worship. Her memory
Moltke carried to his tomb, 23 years a widower.
If the Queen’s Proctor really interferes in
the matter of O’Shea’s rule nisi, with a view to
the rehearing of the Parnell case and the examina-
tion of Parnell and Mrs. O’Shea, his action, you
may be sure, will have the sinister object of
endeavouring to entrap Parnell on a charge of
perjury. That is the game.
The S.M. Herald says of the late Lord
Granville, that “he, the Prince of Wales, and
Earl Lytton are said to surpass everybody else in
making a speech in French. This reminds one of
a Bismarckism; “The Englishman who speaks
French is always a rascal.” Who, during his walk
through life, has not found this to be true ?
Mr. Tatham, a self-educated artisan of
Balmain, Sydney, claims to have cheaply pro-
duced a eoal-and-air-gas with an illuminating
power of eight-and-a-half times that of ordinary
gas. He has received so much encouragement
from the world’s highest scientific authorities that
he proceeds to Europe to deal with his patent.
Parson Scott, of Brisbane, says he hears
the voice of the Lord in the call to Pitt-street
Church, Sydney, where he is to get £3OO a year
more than he was getting in Queensland. They
all do it. Brisbane didn’t suit the pastor’s
health, but The Bulletin predicts that the atr of
Sydney will agree with him uncommonly well.
Sir George Grey may not sit in the Maori-
land Parliament after all. He has a great desire
to revisit England, and, moreover, the climate of
Wellington would, it is much feared, not improve
the lung-affection and bronchitis from which he
suffers. He will decide the matter on his return
to Maoriland, the W. Australian trip having been
abandoned.
It has been said that “Plon-Plon” is a
corruption of “ Craint-Plomb,” or “fear-bullet,”
but Archibald Forbes asserts that it was a boyish
nickname of Prince Napoleon’s, derived from
plonger, to pitch, to dip. “ Plon-Plon,” he says,
“ I take to signify a very waddling waddler; and
that is just what in the matter of gait Jerome was
through life.”
The present constituents of Duncan
Gillies are railing against him, the old Rodney
district has slipped from his clutch for ever, and
the next Victorian elections will probably leave
Duncan without a seat whereon to rest his
pompous fat. An idol humbled in the dust of un-
belief, who hasn’t so much as a wife to whisk the
feather brush over him once a week.
Among the moderate drinkers of modern
times may be reckoned J. E. Boehm, R. A.
Proctor, Mark Twain, W. E. Gladstone, E. A.
Freeman, J. A. Froude, Matthew Arnold, Charles
Darwin, Wilkie Collins, and our modest selves.
All profess or professed temperance both in wine
and smoking. Nearly all the great Frenchmen,
Germans and Russians are non-teetotallers.
Edmund Yates, for printing in the World
a paragraph imputing unchastity to a fashionable
lady, was sent to gaol for four months. Before
the hearing “ Wales ” was asked to intercede and
square the matter, but refused. Yates then evi-
dently declared a vendetta against Wales, and has
made things very hot for him —firstly in re the
baccarat scandal, and secondly by declaring
Wales’ insolvency.
Our favourite Wesleyanic literature just
now teems with John Wesley. His love was
Grace Murray, with whom he starred innocently
round Ireland. But Brother Charles intrigued to
break off the match, because she was a mere ser-
vant, and she was persuaded to immolate herself
on the altar of Brother Bennett, after which John
fell back on a Xantippe, hair-shirt wife, Widow
Fizelle—or Yazille.
London Truth says that George Eliot’s
hasty second marriage, inexplicable even to her
dearest friends, is now accounted for by the state-
ment that “circumstances came to her knowledge
a few weeks after the death of Lewes which froze
up her enthusiasm for his memory.” The lone
widow generally finds an excuse for marrying
again. The absent are always wrong, and there
are none so absent as the men in wooden over-
coats.
Beat this for impudence and cruelty. Old
Tom Keene, octogenarian, who rode in the
Balaclava Charge, applied to Prahran, Melbourne,
Bench last week for relief, having had to pawn his
medals. He wears a plate on his head where he
got a sabre-cut; he was also sabred on the
shoulder and shot in the leg. The chairman of
the bench said it was disgraceful for Her
Majesty’s soldier to pawn his medals, and packed
him off.
It is not generally known that the late
John Brown used to cuss and swear “ something
’orrid ” at the Queen’s favourite moke, when that
overburdened beast objected to carrying her round
the Windsor Castle grounds. At such times
Y.R. would look reproachfully upon the faithful
gillie and say, “Hush, John, I’m surprised at
you!” And John would reply, “Hech, your
Mojesty, it’s this domned dunkey ye ought to be
surprised at, I’m thinkin’.”
Tough old Burtt, aged 83, was to the fore
at Melbourne Eight-hour Demonstration. Not-
withstanding that he is a Munroic teetotaller, he
used to be absolutely unintelligible in the Vic-
torian Parliament, while men like Fraser and
Grant could speak straight sometimes. In 1866
Burtt proposed the Eight-hours resolution at
Queen’s Theatre, but it is disputed whether Gal-
loway or Stephens was the founder, though Gallo-
way got the monument.
Here are the facts of an affair which has
been garbled all sorts of ways. In 1863, when
Palmerston was an octogenarian, one O’Kane
proceeded against him, as co-respondent, in the
divorce court. Pam. being then Premier of England,
damages laid'£2o,ooo. Mrs. O’Kane pleaded that
she was never married, which upset the case, and
it was withdrawn. Palmerston did not plead, but
claimed further affidavits.
Little John Finnamore is a not un-remark-
able man, to be seen in Melbourne. Long ago his
tragedy of “ Carpio ” was warmly praised by
leading London periodicals, but the atmosphere
does not appear to have been favourable to his
poetic development. A departed genius named
R. R. Campbell put in a few touches to “Carpio.”
Campbell was drowned in a terrible Sunday boat-
accident, while a festive party was returning from
John Everard’s Schnapper Point.
Honourable old Macredie, Rip Van
Winkle of Melbourne insurance world, has taken
a safe A 1 risk for the other. He was concerned
in insurances on the Blockade Runners, at Ameri-
can Civil War time, and such business relations
partly accounted for the enthusiastic welcome
accorded to Waddell, and the sharky Shenandoah,
by the Melbourne Club. And handsomely did
England pay through the nose, for the Shenan-
doah’s Melbourne docking, in defiance of Consul
Sam Lord's protests.
When Sir George Grey was Governor of
South Africa, the Duke of Edinburgh, then
16 years old, was sent out to him for “ colonial
experience.” Sir George took Alfred on a hunting
expedition and they got lost, but ultimately struck
a Dutch settler’s hut. The settler’s wife had
nothing but some flour and some grease from the
fat tail of the South African sheep. Sir George
refused this with disgust, but Alfred, who had a
boy’s appetite, rolled the mixture up into a pan-
cake and swallowed it with zest.
The poet Holdsworth, when cashier in the
N.S.W. Treasury, once appeared as witness in an
embezzlement-case. Upon being asked by Frank
Rogers, Q.C., for the defence, if he remembered
certain entries in the cash-book, “Joe” appealed
to the Judge with “ Your Honor, it would take a
Simonides to remember each item.” “Eh, who,
what’s that?” said Rogers. “Simonides,” rolled
out P.J. in his most sonorous tones, “Si-monides,
the great—-Greek—au-thority upon mne-monics.”
“ Ah, ah,” said Rog.ers, “ I knew him well.”
For larcenous plagiarism nothing ever beat
Rev. Dr. Jobson’s steal, in his “ Australian
Travels,” from Frank Fowler’s “Lights and
Shadows of Southern Life.” Poor Frank, like
the “ Vagabond,” had crabbed the Wesleyans
somehow, and so was curious over Jobson, but
stood aghast at the wholesale stealing (the worst
bit being over a shark-story) which he fully ex-
posed by parallel columns in London Athenaeum.
Said Frank : “A whale appropriated a reverend
gentleman, and now one appropriates my shark.”
That dear, dirty, old Shah, over whom
England has twice gushed, is said to have lured
one of his escaped Ministers back to Persia by
false promises, and then to have ordered the poor
wretch to be sawn in halves. The late Persian
ambassador in London, fearful of a death with
“boiling oil or molten lead in it ” if he returned
to Ins beloved Sovereign, has retired into private
life in the Piccadilly district. Moreover, he has
written to the Times, explaining what a mean,
base, bloodthirsty beast the bejewelled Padishah
really is.
Litterateur James Smith, of Melbourne,
like all literary men, and actors not a few, thinks
his powers are quite misapplied, for while the
public gulp him on the drama, art, and aesthetic
cackle, he wants to dose them with the kind of stuff
housed to serve up in the Maryborough (Vic.)
Advertiser. There were vivid proclamations of
how near Doomsday is, with discursions on the
fearful increase of crime, wars, and natural con-
vulsions. If anyone wants an excursus about the
Blanco Encelada’s sanguinary bombardment of
Pisagua, followed by her blow-up by the torpedo,/
(James is on. /
The U.S. Government is still paying
pensions to twenty-three widows whose husbands
fought in the revolutionary war, despite the fact
that the American revolution just 109
years ago. The oldest of these females is 98 and
the youngest only 72, consequently there is a
difficulty about crowding the latter person in.
It is supposed, however, that her husband started
fighting along with Washington when he was 14,
and then lived peacefully as a bachelor till the age
of 73, at which period he married a girl of 16 who
has now grown into the widow aforementioned.
This is a tight fit, but the widow got in and
collects her pension regularly.

4th May. W. G. SPENCE.
Brisbane owes many prominent figures in
the present labour struggle to the incubating influ-
ence of the compositors’ frame. Buzacott, pro-
prietor of the Courier;; Moreley, editor of the
Observer ; Lane, editor of the Worker ; Hinch-
cliffe, secretary of the Labour Federation; Walker,
envoy extraordinary to the Argentine Republic,
and Crawford, all at one time earned their liveli-
hood as compositors. J. D. Fitzgerald was also a
compositor, and is now a proof-reader on the
Australian Star. Henry George began life as a
“ comp.,” and Mark Twain once set type on the
Golden Age, a San Francisco weekly of which
Walter Adams, son of the ex-Surveyor General of
N.S.W., was subsequently editor and part-pro-
prietor.
Reseigh Martin writes that the powerful
influence of the Synagogue has been exercised
from time to time in favour of the release of the
murderer, Bertrand, who has now been 26 years
in gaol, and not so long ago, at the close of Mr.
William Clarke’s term of office as N.S. W. Minister
of Justice, these efforts were so close to fruition
that he was dressed in a tailor-made suit of
clothes, his belongings were packed, and the date
of his departure fixed, when the veto of Sir
Alfred Stephen (the Judge who presided at his
trial, and certain of whose family, by the way, are
popularly believed to have been mentioned in
Bertrand’s diary) interposed, and the wretched
man was ordered back into convict’s uniform, and
told in effect to wait till the clouds roll by.
Martin also says that Wadham Wyndham, who,
while religiously mad, slew his wife and two of his
children, is now sane and at Darlinghurst.

Listen ladies ! “ Silver threads among
the gold.” It sounds very poetical, of course,
but was there ever a woman who didn’t prefer her
own golden or black tresses minus these silvern
streaks of time? Certainly not, therefore why
not call upon Mr. G. Von Brakkel, 32 King-
street, and procure some of his vegetable hair-
restorer? It is a wash of his own invention, and
although it restores gray hair to its original colour,
it has no evil effects like most washes. The most
becoming fringes to match any hair are always on
hand at this establishment, and they are made so
beautifully and look so natural that they can be
worn without the slightest fear of detection.

It is at Messrs. Cecil Hordern and Co.’s,
486, 488, and 490 George-street, that those splen-
did tailor-made ladies’ Berlin ulsters, cloaks, and
mantles are to be seen. These articles are genuine
bargains, costing little over 305., and are made
in the latest styles and finished off in a manner
which is usually only seen in the most expensive
cloaks. Now is the time to invest, as the cold
winds are beginning to be felt and bargains like
these are not to be met with every day. _ Messrs.
Cecil Hordern are also showing some choice opera
cloaks, and plush jackets with Astrakhan trim-
ming, from 15?. upwards.

It is refreshing to see how quickly ladies
tifke a hint. Since mentioning the fact that
/a, ladies’-room has been opened at the City Buffet
there has been no lack of the fair sex there for the
midday meal. The same faces are to be seen
repeatedly, which fact in itself speaks volumes.
Everybody is served in fir.-t-class style, and the
charges are precisely the same as in the gentle-
men’s room—a dinner can be had from one shil-
ling upward.

Messrs. Chas. T. Browne and Co. are

furniture. As this firm import their goods direct
the prices are invariab’y low. An elegant suite,
consisting of six chairs, all in different patterns,

seems incredible, but anyone calling at the estab-
lishment, No. 17 Hunter-street, can see for them-
selves—and seeing’s believing.,
Lovers of good and tender poultry and the
most delicious game, will be interested to know
that Mr. A. J. Harris, who was over 21 years in

street Markets, has started on his own account
at 69 Market-street, next door to Uhde and Co.
The best of poultry, etc., is always on hand, and
customers (both old and new) can rely upon having
their orders promptly attended to.

“A glass of Marie Brizard, come? ”

Dining With. Death.
The death of the United States Secretary of the
Treasury, Windom, was sudden and tragic.
Many of our public men have been stricken by the
hand of the destroyer at the post of duty; in
Windom's case the blow fell during a brief interval
given to social recreation—he was dining with
death. It is hard to make the people believe it,
but the man who accepts a post as chief executive
of any of the great departments of the nation, and
does his duty, is taking his life in his hands.
Many of these officials live through the ordeal,
but few come out of office in good health.
Folger, Manning, and now Windom, three
victims in less than a decade of devotion to the
exacting duties and immense responsibilities of the
proper care of the national treasury. What killed
them? Not solely over-work ; many men perform
as many hours of labour every day as did either
of these men, without impairing their vital
energies. It is the immense mental strain upon
men filling great executive positions that
gradually, but surely, saps their physical strength.
They feel themselves gradually giving way, but
they cannot pull up. There is no cessation of the
drain upon their physical powers, and finally
some fateful link in the chain snaps and the end
is reached. They might have been saved ?
Doubtless ; many a man has been, by a simple
process. When a man begins to feel the fatigue
and weakness of physical, combined with mental,
over-work, he should see that the great purifying
organs of the system, the liver and kidneys, are in
order for the work they have to perform—re-
moving all impurities from the system, so that
nature may not be hindered, but aided, in its
labour of restoring health and strength. The
notable victims of over-work we have named were
strong, hearty, healthy men, naturally. If they
had kept liver and kidneys in healthy working
order by the use of Warner’s safe cure, which
never fails, the great strain upon their natural
powers might have been much longer borne, at
least, if not entirely neutralised. Alfred Cutler,
of Surry Hills, Victoria, writes us:—“Having
been subjected to the trying climate of the North
of Queensland for a number of years, my health
gave way, and I suffered from liver complaint of an
aggravated nature. I tried a number of medicines,
but ray health remained impaired, and soon after-
wards I was taken with kidney disease. I now
procured Warner’s safe cure, and have no doubt
that had I hesitated I would have fallen a prey to
the dread Bright’s disease. With the use of a
number of bottles of safe cure, my health was
restored, and I was completely cured.”

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, May 13,1891.
Uv Dear Mooramnda,—
“ Society,” tapering down from Lord and Lady Charles
Scott to a curly white poodle in a plush jacket edged with
brass bells (certainly in the topmost wave of doggy style)
turned out in great force at the Rushcutters’ Bay Oval, on
9th inst., when the Zingari team (Lord Jersey, Lord
Ancrum, Goschen, A. Knox, S. E. Laidley, C. H. Hodgson,
“ Sid ” Cape, and one or two others) met the Fleet, headed
by Admiral Scott, and some sensational cricket ensued.
The leading feature of the field was Lord Jersey (wasn’t
it rather odd that His Ex. should play cricket with Sir
John Robertson’s exit ? The Caringtons put off a party
on the occasion of Hon. James White’s decease) who
looked limper still in a checkless suit of white flannej
braided in navy-blue, topped by a forlorn felt hat. His
score was three runs,-and his “fielding” was most in-
teresting, for every time the ball was struck His Excel-
lency would drop into a position of exaggerated watchful-
ness, no matter even if the leathern sphere were whirling
in quite an opposite direction. Some of the players, who
ostentatiously displayed their coats of arms on portions
of their wearing-apparel, gave quite an “ old family ” air
to the scene, though one youth who wore his crest on his
sash, handkerchief and cap, did not soothe, for the family
sign occurred too often and got to look like the brand of
his particular asylum. Afternoon-tea was served in a
striped tent, and as the invitations had not been issued
broadcast late comers were not confronted by tea-leaves
and emptied dishes.
As for the drapings on view, Lady Soott (who will stay
with her people in Melbourne until Admiralty House is
fixed up) wore a black gown embroidered at the foot in
dull crimson and gold, covered by a crimson cloak braided
in black and pinked at the edges; black hat trimmed
with black velvet, ostrich tips, and touches of crimson
velyet; Miss Nellie Hill, dark-blue with relSvements of
blue spot with white, black toreador hat trimmed with
black velvet; Miss M. Cox, fawn tweed and guipure with
scarf of pink chiffon, fawn felt hat trimmed with fawn
ribbons ; Miss Marks, dark slate-blue with vest of mush-
room SuMe, toreador hat trimmed with blue velvet.
Another nice frock was in dark-green cloth braided in
black and finished off in otter fur, wide green velvet hat
and feathers. But what can be said of the girl who
sported a glaring scarlet and yellow tartan aggravated by
a pair of old-fashioned velvet sleeves? Or of another
Vivid lady in light-fawn tweed with a tomato stripe over
a full Garibaldi skirt of red silk—and tan boots ?
The second day of the Lawn Tennis tournament on
Sydney Association Ground, was not largely attended, bub
all the women present were nicely dressed, and there was
a fair peppering of men. Lady Jersey was ushered in ab
8.30 to the strains of the National Anathema, wearing a-
dark-blue hard-felt hat, a size too loose, and buttercup
boots, so the small assemblage was vice-regal at any rate.
There doesn’t seem to be half the public interest taken in
tennis this year as was shown at the ’9O matches—perhaps;
because Victoria, abetted by English champion Eaves, is
making hay of the local cracks, and everybody doesn’t
like to fume on an Austrian chair watching the defeat of
one’s own tribe. Eaves (who plays a galvanic game) is a
short, muscular youth with a boarding-school-girl’s dream
on his upper lip and “ yaller ’’ boots. But he really
shouldn’t play as he does without a cap, not because of
the risk of un coup de soleil (you see I am polishing up-
for the Bernhardt), but because he is just a little bib
billiard-bally on the top. The ground was in perfect con-
dition, just as smooth as cloth, and the band and the
afternoon-tea were satisfactory—but why did they choose'
a boy-let with a contracting patch on his pants, the size
of the map of Asia, to go about head-first after the;
balls ?
Whilst the Jerseys were doing (Maitland, the leading-
masher of that township was seated at the inevitable;
spread, at the right-hand of His Ex., who was smiling a.
gracious smile which lured the unwary masher on to his-
downfall. Stretching out a very muddy boot for the-
Governor’s inspection, he chattily remarked: “ There’s a
state for a boot to be in after a ten-mile ride ! Could your
Excellency tell me what sort of a riding-boot is fashion-
able in England just now ?” But with a forbidding glare;
in his nearest eye, Lord J, answered, shortly, that he
“took no interest in boots,” and turned one sloping
shoulder on his now wilting tormentor.
Sydney Government House garden-party on 6th inst.
for which 1500 cards had been issued, was further-
augmented by a crowd of uninvited people who swarmed-
in under the delusion that “it” was a reception, and;
were politely allowed to infest the premises by Lord and;
Lady J., who received their lawful and unlawful visitants;
in the garden before the entrance. Lady Jersey—who-
always dresses better at home than abroad—wore a French-
grey reception toilet, made en basque, bonnet of gold'
straw, white chiffon, and front of pink roses With strings •
Lord Jersey, in an amethyst tie, of course; the little
Jerseys in pink-striped pongee, Leghorn hats and
feathers. The arrangements were the same as for an At-
Home—a band of music and unlimited lemonade. In
fact, it was a reception on a more “ select” basis than -
when all sorts of people are allowed to hurtle in and no-
questions are asked. If Government House is “society’’
or its Australian prototype), and the Town Hall “civic,”
(he lady in the crinoline and lasting boots ought not to
rage if she is obliged to keep her blue-and-purple bonnet-
in lavender Until the Mayoress is at home.
The gowning at the garden-party was resurrection as;
usual, and as the day was warm, diverse: for some were-
cold and some were hot, So some had furs and some had
not; and some were rouged and some were pale (but-
all were on the “cakes and ale.”) Glaring hues pre-
dominated—one woman in the new crimson with a spiky
hat fixed With gold almost giving one the eye-aohe when
(he iud caught her.
tt must be very dreadful to be st vice-regal person
addressing the average humble “loyal” individual, One
of the tribe who are afraid to say their Soul’s their own
if a coronet happens to be looking round the corner. I
was interested in observing the detneanour of one of these
the other day as she was “taken notice of” by Lady
Jersey. Really the woman looked as if she were a convicted
criminal on eight separate charges, for she hung hfer head
and blushed like a toihato, and hardly could put two
words together from sheer fright. She was so altogether
flabbergasted by the unexpected attention that, if I had
been Lady J., I should have been strongly tempted to say
“ Pray don’t be so afraid--I am not going to bite you.”
In the teeth of the winter, with its attendant blue-cold
noses and wrinkled brows, lovely woman rushes for pearl-
cream and rose de beaute, which get a slight reprieve
during the melting summer, when rouge and Whitewash
are too apt to mingle in one blotchy patch. Some of the
frescoes that I have remarked at recent social gatherings
are Very convincingly arranged, and one artist especially
had worked the carmine so carefully into her jawbone
(they mostly put it on in a round patch of unsoftened
dye, like a pantaloon does) that I really felt I needed the
advice of a male friend who confided to me his secret cf
how to discover whether a woman is naturally blushing or
not. His plan is (he is a bold and graceless boy) “to
touch their faces somehow”—as he puts it, for of course
he doesn’t tell me whether he does it with his moustache
or not. If her cheek is warm en suite to her cherry ripe.
Bess, he concludes she is genuine ; but if she is cold and
pink—like cochineal blanc-mange—then he views her
mantling hue only as an alleged improvement bought at
the chemist’s at so much a bottle.
Mrs. Bland Holt re-appeared at Sydney Royal on 9th
inst., in “The Bells of Haslemere” —an emotional drama
in which Walter Howe, as the good young man, exercises
his flighty back-stop hand-shake, as usual, and some o*
the dancing supes clutch at their clothing as desperately
as if they were holding it on. In the first act, Mrs. Holt
(who received a charming bouquet of ’mums, ferns, roses >
etc.) was girlish in a soft white gown, wide hat trimmed
with scarlet poppies ; Kate Bishop wearing grey with
yoke and cuffs of white embroidery, grey hat with touches
of crimson ; Blanche Lewis in pale-pink draperies and a
very pretty pinky hat. In act three, Maggie Knight
reappears, wearing a soft white muslin with full sleeves,
and sash, tied frontally, of spring-green. In act four, Mrs.
Holt wears a well-fitting gown in large brown and crimson
checks trimmed on a bodice with bands of black velvet 1
Kate Bishop, leaf-brown skirt and long brown velvet
jacket over a pale-blue vest; artistic brown hat with
touches of blue.
An all-wool d.c. assembled and gathered together at
Her Majesty’s Majeroni matinee on 6th instant, with
Lord and Lady Jersey and all the little Jerseys in the
red-satin enclosure dedicated to distinguished itinerances*
and a bevy of beauty and fashion in stalls and circle"
The frocking wasn’t altogether an unmixed blessing, for
one lady was frantically arrayed in orange-colour
surmounted by a hat in red and kingfisher-blue, and
another assault on chromatics was a sort of cabbage-
and-gravy mottle, relieved with gold braid and a hat
like a riot in a prism. Lady Jersey (who will scarcely be
the cause of a rush of the bong-tong to her couturifere’s)
wore a pinky heliotrope silk trimmed with bands of
velvet of the same shade, white bonnet with front of pink
roses and white strings, white fall and cream lace
parasol; the little Jersey girls alike, in cream frocks, flat,
leghorn hats and feathers. Other people present were
Mrs. Harry M'Quade (who sold 150 tickets) in a box,
with a white gown and black hat on ; Miss Nellie Hill in
dark-green and tartan ; Sirs. Victor Cohen in fawn cloth
and browm silk ; Mrs. J. H. Carruthers in black crepe
cloth ; Mrs. Bland Holt (who brought the Misses Coppin,
from Melbourne) in biscuit cloth and dragon-blue silk
trimmings ; Miss M. Windeyer in dark grey-blue silk and
flat white hat and feathers. The matinee realised £450
“ in round numbers.”
I want to find fault with the Engleesh as she is spoke
just now on the Sydney stage generally. One gang of
presumably educated mummers invariably speak Of
England as “ Angland the other day I heard a remark
that the “song was sang.” Piano is “piahno,” and
aitches are scattered broadcast. It really can’t be good
for one’s ear to have to listen to no matter how pretty a
woman remarking ecstatically, " 0 ow appy I am !”—can
It? And a thing that makes me doubt the book-learning
•of average songsters is that when a breach of Lindley
Murray occurs in a lilt they do not correct it, but blindly
warble on according to the printer.

TW - ANTED, Situation as Cook by respectable Girl,

•Open one week.
Respectable “girl ” of 80 is depressing ; I wonder when
a, single woman ceases to regard herself as a “Kittenish
creature standing with reluctant feet,” &c. ? One of the
greatest drawbacks to spinsterhood is that perpetual
friskiness which leads to tanned boots and tight corsets
at 50. A matron of similar age is content to bonnet and
cloak herself, but the unclaimed blessings pin a floral
hat on their skewbald locks and accentuate their bony
frames in skin-fit clothes to the verge of the tomb«
instead of recognising the years they have passed by.
At the second performance of “Masks and Faces ” at the
Garrick, there was a very full-fig circle. A Consul’s wife,
in black, wore a magnificent ruby necklace ; Mrs. B. R-
Wise was artistic in soft brown velvet with Vandyke
•collar, and a gown of pink chiffon, very daintily cut, was
nice enough for anything. A Lord was there, helping him-
self in a very unconventional manner to flowers out of the
■corsage-bouquet of a fair damsel; and two girls, in blue
plush cloaks with bordeaux of imitation diamonds, would
have looked more convincing behind the floats. As “ Peg
Woffington” Miss Achurch wears in the first Act yellow
satin skirt and sleeves with an over-gown of black, edged
with silver lace and bound on the bodice with orange
ribbons, black hat with mass of shaded orange feathers,
•ebony stick with “ diamond” head. In Act 2, an orange-
coloured silk underdress, with the train of blue chintz
pattern covered in spangles. In Act 3, blue brocade petti,
•coat with Dolly Varden polonaise in cream figured satin )
with ruches of cream and blue. Miss Bronton’s one gown
■of mushroom woollen (aren’t the pink chiffon frills
rather an anachronism ?) was beautifully draped on th e
•bodice.

The Girl Who’s Been “Betrayed.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We want a melodrama now —
A thrilling four-act show—
Devoid of her who beats her brow
And utters cries of woe :
Aweary are we of the “ tart ”
(By courtesy, a maid)
That always has a breaking heart,
Because she’s been betrayed.
The leading lady, as a rule,
Comes languidly along
To mention that she was a fool,
And went a little wrong;
Then staggers off, but soon returns
Her masher to upbraid—
And next the aged father learns
His girl has been betrayed.
Good Gracious ! how the story shocks
The old ’un —hear him rave !
It’s bound to bring his grizzled locks
With sorrow to the grave;
Such conduct fills him with disgust,
He screeches, “Worthless jade 1”
And curses (as we've often cuss’d)
The girl who’s been betrayed,
Or, if the “star ” be good and pure
And to the hero true,
Her foster-sister, to be sure,
Asks —“What am I to do?”
She wears a dark dramatic cloak,
She looks a bit afraid,
And groans, until we want to choke
The girl who’s been betrayed.
She tries to drown, in wadding streams,
Her misery and pain;
We brighten up, till someone seems
To fish her out again;
We fondly hope the tearful minx
Will die and go decayed—■
Alas ! she’s saved before she sinks,
That girl who’s been betrayed.
When villains throw her off a cliff
The “ funny man ” is there, _
And still she lives —in half a jiff
He grabs her by the hair ;
For ’tis her fate at last to come
Where wicked schemes are laid,
And strike the vile seducer dumb—
That girl who’s been betrayed.
She talks about her “ honour,” and
She speaks of “ ruin,” till
The simplest bard can understand
What makes her look so ill.
With playwrights she has been for long
A custom of the trade,
But O ! she likes to pitch it strong—
That girl who’s been betrayed.
Dear friends, that girl must disappear
From melodrama show;
She’s haunted us for many a year,
And now she’s got to go.
When next she starts her yarn forlorn,
Stand up—don’t be afraid,
And cry, “ Get out at once, begone !
We know you’ve been betrayed.”

Satan and tho Statesman.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
11 Of this broad land the brain and hand
Am I,” the Statesman said,
“ Where would it be—l’d like to see—
If ’Enery Parkes were dead ? ”
Then Satan sly, who sat hard by
His ear, made answer free —
“ Old Sack of Chaff, you make me laugh !
Just where it is,” said he.
“ You have the marks, Sir Henry Parkes,
Of pride, from crest to spur :
I had ’em all—they caused my fall,
O Little Lucifer!
“ Up there on high I thought if I
Just sulk and go on strike
Why I can do what I dam—phew !
Beatified well like.
“ Mistake, no doubt—they slung me out,
With nothing to my name,
A poor plucked bird, and since, I’ve heard,
Heav’ngets on just the same.
“ And e’en in H —l if I should swell
Around, with haughty air,
And put on size, why, dash my eyes,
They’d fire me out of there !
“ So take my tip—keep down your lip—-
Though you were thrice a King—
Don’t put on airs, for no one cares
A dam for anything. ”
Sailing Song.
(FOR “OUR BEAUTIFUL HARBOUR.”)
Across the sky the white clouds fly,
The breeze begins to blow ;
If you must stay on land, good-bye !
A-sailing I must go ;
A-sailing I must go, sweetheart,
A-sailing I must go.
Then kiss me, dear, and dry that tear,
If you will bide behind,
A maiden waits on Manly pier,
She is not so unkind ;
She is not so unkind, sweetheart,
She is not so unkind.
But come with me, the wind blows free,
Tis time that we were gone !
By Middle Harbour grows a tree,
Your name is carved thereon ;
Your name is carved thereon, sweetheart,
Your name is carved thereon.
With wings of white our boat takes flight,
Her wake shines like a sword.
Ah, well may she go dancing light
That carries Love aboard !
That carries Love aboard, sweetheart,
That carries Love aboard !
The moments run till day is done,
Till day is done, too soon.
We went out sailing with the sun,
We’ll sail back with the moon.
We’ll sail back with the moon, sweetheart,
We’ll sail back with the moon.

The Fate of a Missing Statesman.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The day is fast dying of a raging fever,
and slower and feebler become its gasps and its
throbs, until at length in one long-drawn breath,
which gently stirs the leaves, and for a single
moment fans the burning breast of Mother Earth,
it dozes off to rest. For a funeral-pall for
this latest born child of the sun, there is a filmy
gossamer of royal purple, with fine gold and
diamond dust, and for due solemnity nature
speaks only in whispers, the birds chirp under
their breath, the wearying monotone of the
cicada: is toned down to a diminuendo , and very
shortly all sounds are hushed, and all light—save
that of the stars—is gone.
* • •
Then the residents of the Australian
hamlet steal forth to fall into groups and talk
about the day that is gone, its joys and its
sorrows, its losses and its gains, but chiefly to
compare the readings of their various ther-
mometers. The resident constable and the pub-
lican lead the beau monde ; whilst the shearer
royally “ seeing through ” his cheque represents
Boheraianism, which looks with equal contempt
on all other sets, and ever regards itself —both in
town and in country—as the sole surviving
descendant of a long line of kings and usurps
regal prerogatives accordingly.
* • *
As the residents of a South Australian
hamlet were engaged talking over events and
swapping views one close evening, Senior-constable
Patrick Maher—who represented the Law of the
locality and bore on his own broad shoulders the
incubi of constable in charge, clerk of the
court, registrar of births, deaths and marriages ;
poundkeeper, dog - registrar, and inspector of
nuisances—was seated at his cottage-door—at the
rear of which stood the lookup —intently perusing
a week-old Adelaide paper. Seeing nothing that
either directly or remotely affected him in any
of his official capacities, he arose after awhile,
yawned, stretched his long legs, and cast his big
bottle-green eyes in the direction of the “ Golden
Fleece. ’ He had taken but three measured
regulation paces to the front, however, when he
suddenly stood to attention, and muttered
“blasht ’em !”
Whenever Constable Patrick Maher was dis-
pleased, his great face swelled and reddened, his
soulful eyes protruded from their sockets, and his
massive chest heaved and fell like an angry sea.
At such times, when the Majesty of the Law was
in the throes of labour, even his wife dared not
approach him.
The immediate cause of officer Maher’s dis-
pleasure on this occasion was the approach of two
men, bearing what the policeman’s practised eye
at once discerned to be a corpse. At once obey-
ing the constable’s peremptory order to carry the
body to the “shed beyant,” the two returned to
find Maher seated at a deal table, pen in hand,
ready to take down their story, which, shortly
told, was to the following effect.
They were commercial travellers, and when
within a mile or so of the village, had found
deceased lying on his face a short distance off the
main road, where, in their opinion, he had fallen
and perished from exhaustion. Constable Maher
made it a rule to administer a formal and compre-
hensive caution to anybody who came to impart
information to him in any of his official capacities,
and so, partly on general principles and partly,
perhaps, because the two men before him were,
like himself, in a somewhat “ fresh ” condition, he
performed his customary function on this occasion
with unusual solemnity, telling his two visitors,
by way of conclusion, that, being “ knowledgeable
min,” they ought to be aware that it was no part
of their duty as mere civilians to express any
opinion on the cause of death. That was for the
coroner to find out.
The two travellers were then bound over to
attend the inquest next day, and after the con-
stable had thrown some chaff-bags over the corpse
and locked the door of the shed which served as a
morgue, he wandered leisurely down to the tele-
graph-office to wire for the district coroner, who
lived ten miles away. This done, he went about
the task of collecting his jury, and for that pur-
pose repaired to the “Golden Fleece,” where,
during the evening, he had no difficulty in captur-
ing “ twelve good men and true ” in various
stages of intoxication, having meanwhile accepted
bribes in the form of drinks from many more for
the privilege of being “ let off.”
# * #
At ten o’clock on the following morning,
which happened to be St. Patrick’s Day, the
jury, many of them suffering a severe recovery,
were assembled in the parlour of the “ Golden
Fleece,” awaiting the arrival of the coroner, and
variously beguiling the time by sleeping, reflecting
and playing euchre for drinks. The only relief to
the monotony of the playing and drinking was
caused by an adipose and pompous German, who
happened unguardedly to propound the question
—“ Who vash dat St. Ba' rick, any vay ?” This
was sufficient to induce Con Dillon, another of
the intelligent twelve, to arise, take up three
holes in his waist-belt, spit on the floor, and
glower upon the speaker with rage and contempt.
“ And phwat the divil have ye to say about St.
Phadng, ye square-headed Yarman sausage?”
demanded the patriotic Con; “kirn out ye tub
o’ sour kraut, and Oi’ll teach ye about the glorious
sivinteenth of ould Oireland. Hooruo !”
What kind of a national celebration might have
ensued it is hard to say, had not Constable
Patrick Maher, in the full dignity of his office,
entered at that moment, and announced the
arrival of the coroner—a little, fat, bald ball of
humanity, who waddled in with the curt announce-
ment, “ Gentlemen, choose your foreman.” The
choice fell on the German, who was the soberest
of the party, not without a malignant scowl from
Con Dillon, who was the drunkest, by way of
protest.
The usual preliminaries having been arranged,
the doctor —whom the coroner had brought with
him —was requested to go down to the lock-up,
a distance of about a mile, and make a post-
mortem examination of the body while the Con-
stable’s evidence was being taken. Constable
Patrick Maher then, having kissed the Bible with
aloud report, straightened himself up, fixed his
ejes on vacancy, and bore testimony as follows,
in the sententious style peculiar to policemen,
watching the coroner’s pen the while to see that
he was not getting ahead of that fussy little
functionary : —“About tin p.m. on the aveningav
yesterday I was standing in front of me dhure —
at a distance, roughly spaking, of about foive
paces—and was nigligintly laning aginst a posht,
whin I was suddenly recalled to meself by the
appearance of two reshpectably-drissed men,
slightly under the influence of drink, bearing
betune them the corpse, which is lying beyant in
the lock-up. They enquired for a constable, and
I replied—which Oi am a saynyer wun—being in
plainclothes at the toime. The men described them-
selves as travellers, and deposed that they had
found deceased lying on his face, a moile or so out
of the village, I cautioned them in the usual
way, and bound them over ”
Just here the doctor burst into the room in a
stats of breathless excitement and red-hot fury,
and in answer to the Coroner, who said, “Well,
doctor, what do you make of it?” replied—banging
his hat on the table —
“ Make of it! I make it a d d wax-headed
dummy, belonging to some travelling show or
tailor’s shop, and if this mutton-headed constable
had taken the trouble to look at it, we might
have been spared a jaunt of ten miles in the dust
and heat.”
It then burst upon the dormant intellect of the
jury that at that moment there was an itinerant
wax-works exhibition, located in a barn a short
distance from the hotel, whence the voice of the
showman could even then be heard, inviting the
locals to “ roll up and witness the greatest collec-
tion of wax-figgers south of the line.”
The two commercial travellers when called upon
failed to answer to their names, and while the
inquest was proceeding two rakish-looking
objects, convulsed with mirth and with _ hats
pulled over their eyes, rapidly drove off behind a
pair of horses in a southerly direction. They
passed on their way a weird-looking creature of
dejected visage, in a pie-bald costume—who was
no other than the aforesaid showman—cursing and
perspiring over the task of nailing to a three-rail
fence a hand-written placard of which the follow-
ing is a copy :
WERE HAS last night the grand Hold man
Parkes was removed Out of His place in My
show and King solomon has his nose chipped off

God Save the queen.
By Order Jabez Waxman.
N.B. man and Money at the “ lucky dog ” Hotel

Within a month Patrick Maher was transferred
to another field of official usefulness, and it is
said that to this very day his successor never
takes over a corpse until he has probed it all over
with a cold-chisel.
HENRY O’DONNELL.
In a lecture on “ Municipal Socialism,”
Rev. Joseph Wood lately advocated the munici-
palisation of the tramways and electric-lighting,
and the establishment of free education, a public
gymnasium, a city band, and, above all things, the
purchase of an estate by corporations, on which
to build, as required, thousands of model work-
men’s dwellings, each provided with a garden and
the whole with public hall, free library, baths and
wash-houses, gymnasium, school, recreation-
ground and public garden—all communicating
with the centre of the town by a municipal tram-
way, a season-ticket for this tramway being
included in the rent.
Young Armytage, the little Victorian
M.L.A., "objects to the title “ Australian Com-
monwealth,” on the ground that there is “ nothing
distinctive in it at all.” The aspiring youth, after
careful enquiry into the matter, cannot discover
that the word expresses the relations existing
between himself (whose acres have come to him
with a double “ first family ” pedigree in the male
line) and the struggling “cockatoo” farmer with
no ancestry worth mentioning. This, however,
is merely the fault of private circumstances, and
in no way detracts from the distinctiveness of
“ Commonwealth ’as a political terra. Armytage
would prefer the word “Federation,” which is
certainly not distinctive, and would serve only as
a reminder that some An ralians- beg pardon—
are too well fed, whilst others go miserably short
of rations.
Prince Baldwin of Flanders, heir-pre-
sumptive to the Belgian crown, who died suddenly
a few months ago, has left the usual little story
behind him. The affair was hushed up at the
time, and it was vaguely rumoured that the
deceased had gone oft through a dozen different
ailments. He was seized with a mysterious pain
in his outside and had gangrene in the coat-tail
pocket —he had fallen up dead through corns in
the head—he had caught cold through being out
late at a meeting of the social purity society, and
he also fell and broke his neck coming from
church. But it has now leaked out that he went
the way of princes in general, and died through a
joyous spree and a woman. It was the old, old
story—he thought the husband was out for the
night, and the husband came home after all, and
pounded madly on the front door. Then the dis-
tracted prince looked out of the window, and the
man below saw him, and realised the situation,
and burst in, carrying the casement and all the
curtains along with him, and rushed up the stair
to wallop the intruder with the tongs. A dis-
tracted female went into hysterics among the bric-
a-brac on the sideboard, and leaped and gambolled
among the furniture generally. Then the prince
made a frantic effort to climb down a water-pipe,
but half way down his plentiful ear got hitched on
a nail, and his teeth caught on a projecting brick,
and he hung there howling and praying, with his
collar burst, and his hair standing up, and his hat
stove in, and all his shirt-buttons giving way.
The horrified lady inside grasped her enraged
husband and implored him not to bang the Lord’s
Anointed, and he asked sternly if it was the Lord’s
Anointed who was making the night hideous sus-
pended against the side of the house. Being in-
formed that it was, he got his gun, and then the
lady leaped in the air with a howl and fell in-
sensible under the grate. Outside, the Lord’s
Anointed was making a worse row than ever,
and swinging sadly up and down the wall. A
gun slowly emerged through the window, and the
prince shrieked out to the holder of it that he
would make him a duke on the spot provided he
didn’t shoot. There was no answer, only the gun
t came further out and a staring head came out
after it, and the heir apparent yelled that he
would make him three dukes —eighteen dukes —
would give him an estate—would lend him a
harem, ir he would—the gun went off just then,
and the billet of heir to the Belgian crown fell
vacant. This is the latest accout of how Bald-
win took his departure. We have added a few
interesting details to give thrill to the situation,
but otherwise it is correct up to the last available
advice.
Messrs. Hertzberg, Millingen and Co.
Brisbane.
The house of Messrs. Hertzberg, Millingen and
Co., General Merchants and Importers, Charlotte-
street, Brisbane, is able to supply most of the
wants of Queensland residents, not only with goods
of Australian make, but also in wares of European
and American manufacture. A glance through their
warehouse is sufficient to bespeak its importance.
A large, solid brick building of imposing appear-
ance, divided into five stories, it could not fail
to strike the eye of The Bulletin’s represen-
tative as one of the finest and most prosperous
importing houses in the city of Brisbane. Now,
a word as to the inception and origin of this im-
portant business establishment. Although started
but two and a half years ago, it has in the mean-
time met with pronounced success, and as it is
steadily advancing month by month in a safe and
profitable way its prospects are now well assured.
There are four partners in the business, all prac-
tical men and thoroughly conversant with the
various details of the departments which comes
under their immediate control. Mr. A. M.
Hertzberer, who has been in business in Queens-
land for 25 years, has charge of the office, counting-
house, and financial branch ; Mr. C. S. Millingen
(formerly with Messrs. Hoffnung and Co.) has the
management of the warehouse. Of the other
partners, Mr. B. Cohen—who, by the way, is
a son of Mr. S. Cohen, of Ulmarra, one of the
most respected residents of the Clarence district —
has charge of one of the important floors in the
establishment,, besides exercising a general super-
vision with Mr. Millengen. Mr. Abraham Hertz-
berg (brother of the senior partner) is the firm’s
chief travelling representative, and occupies a
forward place among the many industrious com-
mercial travellers of Queensland.
When the firm was organised early in 1888 it
was decided that Messrs. Hertzbergand Millingen
should visit Europe to make personal selection of
all goods required, and come in closer touch with
the merchants and manufacturers. One of the
most important features of the trip was securing
the sole agency for Queensland of the Victoria
Porcelain Works, Carlsbad, Bohemia, celebrated
for the beauty and delicacy of finish of its china
and glass fabrics. Messrs. H. M. and Co., in
accepting orders for special china designs, wish it
notified that, in addition to any particular design
selected, they can arrange to have photographs,
monograms, or inscriptions wrought into the
china according to the wishes of the purchaser.
A brief glance shows that one floor is devoted to
crockery, china, glassware, including all the most
useful, delicate and fanciful goods made by the
hand of man. Another floor contains a large
assortment of ironmongery of all descriptions, in-
cluding electro-plased ware, cutlery, American
hardware, guns, rifles, revolvers, large, strong
safes (by the Midland Safe Co., Birmingham),
also a very fine collection of English saddles and
saddlery goods. On another floor is on view
pianos, billiard-tables, Austrian bentwood furni-
ture, writing-cases, portmanteaux, travelling-bags,
brief-bags, and innumerable other goods. Next
comes the tobacconist and perfumery department,
to which is attached the Queensland agency for
David Dunlop’s Columbia and Derby Tobaccos
(an imnnnse success), Kinney Bro’s, Sweet
Caporal Cigarettes, Motley’s King of All Cut
Tobacco, Virginia, La Divinidad Cigars and
A tlantica Cigars. As to perfumery, the supply
is legion, including all the distillations and col-
lections of the choicest flowers. A special feature
of the perfumery department is the sole agency for
Queensland of Jas. S. Kirk and Co., Chicago,
prize brands toilette soaps, now new to the Aus-
tralian colonies. The stationery department con-
tains account books, ledgers, novels, &c., in al
bindings, writing-paper, and many other items.
The top floor is reserved for the toy depart-
ment-hobby-horses, jumping-jacks, toy games,
bagatelle boards, and every class of game.
On the basement floor, all goods are packed
and despatched to the order of various consti-
tuents. Messrs. Hertzberg, Millinger & Co.
employ thirty-two hands, whilst six commercial
travellers are doing business over the length and
breadth of Queensland. They have agencies at
New York, Paris, Vienna, Hamburg, Bohemia
and London.

The. Labourer.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Laborer rises at the break of day,
To groan out life in toil for paltry pay—
Pay that scarce feeds and covers him with rags,
And, captive to the Rich, his chain’d soul drags
One woe of sweat, yet counting toil a boon,
He bends his patient back from dawn till noon.
At noon, by leave, he lights his sullen eye,
And curses God and man and earth and sky._
His grudged brief breathing-respite o’er, again
He bows his manhood to eventless strain,
Nor pauses, watched with rigorous intent,
Till, equally, the day and he are spent. *
So, drearily, his body is confined ;
But who can plumb the hell that’s in his mind ?
Perchance a thought of children, or of wife,
With feeble pallor glints his clouded life ;
Perchance his gloom with memory is fed
Of wife and child, by famine’s freezing, dead.
No errant beam of Hope illumes his face,
lie has no ties among the caste of race, _
He cannot claim to hold the humblest niche
Of common right—that privilege for the Rich,
Who, like to Judas, traitor to the Christ,
Still sell their Brother Man as may be priced.
Far better, thinks he, that he’d ne’er been born,
Yet finds defiance for the tyrant’s scorn.
The Rich may mock him as their flunkeys goad,
He bears their insults as he bears their load.
Few words of kindness ever greet his ears
Toil, toil, and toil, all through the weary years.
From him hides Hope; Woo mates him all his life ;
He’ll die of toil amid a devil’s strife,
Rich buy and sell him as they do ah ox; ,
Kings, for their pleasure, hunt him like a fox ;
His life one horror, and his death no knell,
He fears not God, nor gallows, nor a hell,
Nor spirit-torments parsons paint as rife —
Why should he fear ? He has his Hell in Life,
Where Privilege embrutes him in the dust,
For sake of gold, to pamper sordid lust;
That gold, wrung from his flesh, his blood, his
bones,
His manhood’s misery, his old-age’s groans.
All-worshipp’d gold, the Murderer of Toil I
Black-mail of Poverty, a bloody spoil!
As yet, the wakening masses only hum
The fragments of the anthem yet to come,
When, not for Justice will meek pliants sue,
sut Retribution on the gorging few
Who banish leisure from the Labourer’s life,
And draw their fatness out of social strife ;
Who grip the masses in a choking thrall,
And bid them show deep gratitude|for gall.
The time is near when all these bonds shall break,
When what the Rich won’t give, the Poor will
take;
When ’twill be deemed far better worth to die
Amid rebellion’s mad, unreasoning cry,
Than, for a space, to dodge a restful grave,
By living on, and dying still, a slave.
O, wise among the powers that tyrannise
(If there be any now among you wise ?),
Be warned in time. Let J ustice shape your plan;
Hear Labour now—as Man to Brother-Man.
JAMES BARR.
When the foundation-stone of the Eight
Hours’ memorial statue was laid in Melbourne,
Premier Munro made a speech about the grandeur
of Labour, and remarked that he had himself
toiled “in his shirt-sleeves” for 11J hours per
diem. He stopped there just when he was on
the brink of saying something interesting. What
the audience wanted to know was how he liked
it, and whether he was contented and happy in
those days, and if he ever said anything then
about the grandeur of Labour, and what show he
thought he might have had of becoming a Premier
if he had kept on working, instead of taking to
banking, money-lending, and land-booming, which
are not working in any reasonable sense, but
trading on other people’s work. Also, he might
have mentioned whether he ever knew any brawny
toiler who was enthusiastic about the beauty of
Labour, except after he had given up labouring.
For the unvarnished truth of the matter is that
Labour, in most of its aspects, is the saddest,
dreariest, dullest, most monotonous, and most
heart-breaking thing beneath the snn. If the
labourer is working on his own account,
and for his own sole profit, he may extract
pleasure out of the most unpromising intervals,
but the individual who breaks stones, or shovels
coal, or digs, or ploughs, or carries bricks
up a ladder, or does one of a thousand routine jobs
for an employer, has got an occupation that is as
melancholy and hopeless as that of a blind horse
in a coal mine. And as there is only room for about
one man in a hundred to quit this mode of life,
and become an employer, or a banker, or a land-
lord, for the simple reason that the other ninety-
nine are wanted for him to live upon when he has
joined that carnivorous trio, it follows that the
balance have very little amusement except drink,
and strikes, and things of that sort, and it is the
odd man who makes observations about the
pleasures of toil. And, as a rule, it is a matter of
mere accident who is that odd man out of a
hundred, and the man who is taken is very much
the same as the man who is left. It only wanted
a passing chance about the size of a hair and the
affable Premier with his oily platitudes about the
grandeur of Labour might have been a shearer
named Munro who got six months for using
violence to the police at Clermont.
Ode to the People.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Upon the cross of slavery
The people long have hung ;
The million toiling for the few,
The face of Justice hid from view,
E’en sturdy Truth has ages through
Withheld her clarion longue.
The golden tyrant, centuries gone,
Has triumphed over right;
Has taken for his dwelling-place
The birthright of the human race,
Bade Liberty to cloud her face,
And bow before his might.
The world before his loathsome spaw»
Has grovelled in the dust;
The blood of man has trickled down,
And woman of her fairest crown
Has been despoiled, to ’suage his frown,
Or sate his brutal lust.
And still beneath his “ noble ” feet
Man lays his manhood down ; ,
Consents his birthright to forego,
Owns his hereditary foe
As lord of all the earth below,
And cringes at his frown.
But see ! through yonder dark cloud’s rift
What gleam of light outsprings ?
Has Liberty awaked from death ?
The sword of Justice left its sheath ?
Has Truth renewed her wav’ring breath
And spread her snowy wings ?
Mankind ! uplift your prostrate form 1
Strike, and ye shall be free 1
The darkness has begun to part,
The rays of dawnlight onward dart,
Announcing to your fettered heart
The Morn of Liberty.
Oppression’s tree bears bitter fruit
That tyranny must taste;
Proclaim your manhood while ye may.
Welcome the dawn of that bright day
When Justice shall alone hold sway,
Ho more to he debased.

Mr. W. H. Kent, J.P., a Successful
Colonist.
Mr. W. H. Kent is about the best-known layman
in Queensland, and in the city of Brisbane there
is no more popular man. He has been thoroughly
identified with Queensland for many years past,
and, independent of being recognised as one of
the ablest business men in the city, he is favour-
ably known in sporting circles, as also on the magis-
terial bench. Air. Kent is a native of Sydney,
and the second son of the late Captain
Charles Kent, of Stepney, London, an officer
who accompanied (his relative) Lord Castle-
reagh in that memorable tour through
Ireland which culminated, it was stated, in Lord
Castlereagh’s reports upon Irish affairs being as
prejudicial as they were untruthful. Fortunately
Captain Kent’s observation and sense of reason
with regard to the Irish question showed matters
in a very different aspect, and his able articles
in the columns of The Times dealing with the
subject were characterised by their impartiality,
vehemence and reason. W hen Lord Castlereagh
died, Captain Kent went on a tour to China,
America and finally arrived in Sydney, where
Mr. W. H. Kent was bom in 1836, his mother
dying the same week. She was the third daughter
of the Hon. Wheeler Barrington, of Merrion
Square, Dublin, her two sisters having been
attendants as Maids of Honor to Queen Victoria.
When Mr. W. H. Kent was but five years of age
his father had occasion to go to England and
afterwards sent to Sydney for his son. Soon
afterwards Captain Kent died, and his young son
returned to Sydney, his native place. Here Mr.
Kent obtained the rudiments of a useful educa-
tion at “ Smither’s ” and “ Gordon's ” schools,
institutions well-known in those days.
The discovery of the goldfields soon found young
Kent to the front, first at the Ophir, then the
Turon, thence to Braidwood and Adelong. He had
the good fortune to secure a blessing greater than
riches—a good wife—to whose counsel and advice
Mr. Kent is indebted for much of his present pro-
sperity Mr. Kent’s association with the gold-
fields was in a business capacity. He ran horse
and cattle sales-yards at one and the same time at
Adelong, Kiandra, Lambing Flat, and Forbes.
His energy was phenomenal his journeys
on horseback during a single day often tot-
ting up 80 to 90 miles. Asa horse sales-
man, it is often remarked that Mr. Kent
had no equal. Having got tired of a life on the
goldfields, he went to Brisbane, and there settled
m his old line for 20 years as a horse salesman, then
as a land speculator, as also a well-known and
popular breeder of thoroughbred stock, and has,
without doubt, done much to place the Queens-
land turf in the sound position it now occupies.
Mr. Kent acted as honorary secretary to the
Queensland Turf Club for a number of years and
put the club’s affairs in a sound and prosperous
condition, but not before he had spent some
thousands of pounds sterling in introducing
high - class thoroughbred stock. Mr. W. H.
Kent has owned probably more racehorses
during the last 36 years than any other man in
Australia, and some rare “ clinkers ” among them,
notably Le Grand, My Lord, “ The Australian
Peer,” Napper Tandy, Tippler, Fernando, Epi-
gram, and Darebin. Like most genuine sports-
men, Mr. Kent never bets, but runs his horses
for his own pleasure. Asa business man
Mr. Kent is known and appreciated among his
fellow-men as the acme of honour and good-
heartedness. He carries his years well when it is
remembered that his eldest son is a Doctor of
Medicine, another son a well-known solicitor,
and another a banker—this out of a family of ten.
Mr. Kent for the present takes no part in politics,
but is favourably known as a good and impressive
speaker. He is a large property-holder in Brisbane,
and is closely associated with many large financial
institutions. One of his most brilliant moves was
the establishment of the Royal Bank of Queens-
land, one of the most successful banking institu-
tions throughout Australia.

“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
** Th. © B ulle t i lx,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
It the only paper which has a consistent and tU$
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Governments
Payment of Members.
One Person, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prim
System.
A United Australia and Protection
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as unintereating more
than half of what appears in the newspapers at
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti*
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was’
started eleven years ago with no capital but brains>
and has become a vast property, because it pos.*
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, ita
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matte*
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-shelier of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than ant
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

To H. P. Kuget.mann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, wa
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, whicl
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consults
move than one doctor, and during that time took a grea
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightes
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting away unti
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I begat
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and seven
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter
was expect'rating every day, 1 became very much alarmed
Hearing of your professional skill 1 consulted you, am
you told me you could cun' me for a given sum. 1 agreed
and Wt-nt under your treatment in March last. At th<
©tat of three months I was taken had one morning, ant
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
■phlegm, _ From ( hat time I commenced to improve, nnc
was gaining in weight, every day. About a month ago thi
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro
fes'iona! skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
