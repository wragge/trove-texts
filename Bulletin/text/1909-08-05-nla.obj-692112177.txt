THE RED PAGE
Maurice Hewlett
Maurice Hewlett prints a small collection
of poems under the title of Artemision :
Idylls and Songs (Elkin Mathews), all of
which were written between 1895 and 1898.
In the same period he wrote The Forest
Lovers, Pan and the Young Shepherd, and
the Little Novels of Italy (published 1899).
Any reader of these might expect that if
Hewlett sang he would do so vigorously,
warmly, and romantically. His later prose,
Pichard Yea and Nay, The Fool Errant, and
The Queen's Qua-ir —the best historical novel
for many years—strengthen the association
of power and a pagan appreciation of vigor-
ous, life with the name of Hewlett. Arte-
mision represents another side of his nature,
for the poems are coldly chaste in manner,
and almost entirely classical in subject.
The virile imaginative force which is rife in
his other work, here runs in moral harness.
Most of the poems are devoted to Artemis,
the goddess of virginity and purity. Juvenal
satirically comments that in his time whole
towns worshipped the dog, but nobody
worshipped Diana. She has never been a
favorite of the poets, perhaps for the reason
which appears in Hewlett’s description of
her (or rather her Grecian double), after
causing Niobe’s children to be wiped out:
The mistress of the cold nights on the hill,
Whose footfall is the soughing of the trees,
And her white splendor seen when moonbeams
freeze
The bleachfc earth huddled lowly on the plain;
Who slays and passes, looking not again ;
Who, all too lovely to be loved, still goes
Guarding with steadfast eyes her breast of snows.
* • * *
Callisto, a damsel who was not as virtuous
as she might have been, was punished by the
chilly divinity, being turned into a bear,
afterwards slain by her love-child, and then,
as a mark of special favor, turned into a con-
stellation. Hewlett retells the story ap-
parently for the sake of the moral:
And thus sink they who serve Beauty
Otherwise than on bending knee,
Or dare to quench their fleshly dreams
At holy wells, in holy streams
To bathe their bodies. Beauty is rare
And delicate withal, so fair,
So thin a fabric, ’tis a breath
Of God’s, whose prisoning is death.
* * * •»
Believing that Keats had told Endymion’s
story wrongly, Hewlett sets forth his own
version—in which the boy, in a bad state of
calf-love, chases and captures the goddess :
Handlockt they stray’d, he trembling, she afar,
Quiring in thought, but never less possest
That when he Jed her captive ; her mind’s car
Lifted her out of ken. She held her breast.
The couched flowers that lay embraced in bed
Made nuptial music to him as led
Her to a thicket; yet scarce dared he lean
Nearer than touch her garment. She not stay’d
Him stick a rose-knot in her bodice green :'
He thrill’d to touch her—yet no word he said.
• • • « . .
About her waist his arm ; lips brush her cheek ;
His words beat on her—yet she does not speak.
She rests and lets him sob his soul away ;
But her curl’d lips straighten them and grow bleak,
And in her eyes the fell and steely grey
Hardens like wintry dawns. His words grow
weak.
Stammering he stands before her with bent head
Rogue all confest. Her chill eyes freeze him dead.
No word she speaks but cuts him to the bone
With that cold glitter. Under nameless dread
A shuddering takes him—his heart like a stone
Lies clog’d and lumpish with a weight of lead.
* * * *
Some of the sonnets in the Shakespearian
manner, and a song “To Crocuses,” which
might have been written by Francis Thomp-
son, are good ; but Hewlett is more agreeable
in Pan and the Young Shepherd and some of
his prose fiction.
* * * *
Many of his readers hoped that Hewlett
would return to the field of pure romance so
charmingly exploited in The Forest Lovers,
of which, by the way, a new edition has just
been issued at 7d. A Sydney admirer recently
suggested to him that he should write a
romance about the career of Tamerlane, to
which Hewlett replied :
If I ever did anything about a hero of Timur’s
sort it would, I think, be Napoleon. But I fancy
that I have done with the romantic of the past:
There is plenty of it in the present—as I have just
begun to discover. . . .
We noted recently that Marriott Watson
had gone over to the flag of H. G. Wells,
and was trying to discover the flowers of the
heart which bloom in the present. Hewlett
is a brilliant recruit who might be able to
take first place in that band—if lie remains
an artist, and does not become a tradesman.
Australasia
’Neath Austral Skies by Louis Becke (John
Milne) is a collection of stories, sketches and
personal reminiscences which make a readable
book. In “ The Loneliness of It ”he gives
the depressing experience of a Scottish
friend who had been lured to the Pacific by
the glowing but misleading articles of a lady
gipbe-trdtter ; also an account of Becke’s
own way of bearing up against the loneliness
for eleven months on Nanomagain the Ellice
group. Thereisan account of ‘ ‘ The most hate-
ful place I know,” “ Skippers I have sailed
with ” (including Bully Hayes), and the Land
of “Lots of Time,” to wit, his birth-place in
New South Wales. Becke mentions that
this township was founded in November,
1823, by a company of soldiers and some
hundreds of convicts, and that one of the
latter wrote these lines :
True patriots all ! For be it understood
We left our country for our country’s good—etc.
Port Macquarie, which has the honor of
being Becke’s birth-place, was surveyed by
Oxley in 1819 and founded in 1822 by an
expedition under the command of Captain
Allman. It is now known that the lines
quoted were not written by a convict. They
were published in 1802 by an anonymous
English writer of prologues, who, on read-
ing that a theatre had been opened by con-
victs in Sydney, wrote a prologue which he
put in the mouth of “the celebrated Mr.
Barrington.” The title of Becke’s book has
already been used for a book of verses by
E. B. Loughran, of Melbourne ; but Becke
could hardly be expected to know that.
In The Angel of the Earthquake (Atlas
Press, Melb.) Prank Morton gives a
first-hand account of the calamity which
destroyed Wellington (M.L.) in 1910, and
shows “how thin a crust lay between our
civilisation and the Pit.” A journalist named
Waterton took charge of the damaged city,
and brought order out of chaos. He was the
“ Angel of the Earthquake,” and they
erected a statue to him before this history
was written in 1960-—quite the conventional
thing to do, though by that time most of the
present conventions had been destroyed.
It is a slight sketch, but it enables Prank
Morton to have a fling at the beastly
nineteenth century, mob rule, womanhood
suffrage and Marie Corelli. Bound with it
is a slighter sketch, With Joy in Arcady.
The narrator (presumably another journalist)
happens to be in the gallery of a Sydney
theatre when it collapses, and the accident
precipitates him into Arcadia. Heaven is
but the vision of fulfilled desire, according
to Omar; so this Arcadia is the Land of the
Voluptuary’s Longing, and no wowsers,
social gimlets or other objectionable people
are admitted. It is inhabited only by hearty
males such as Ben Jonson, Herrick and
Casanova; frail but fair ladies like Nell
G-wynn and Agnes Sorel; nymphs and their
satyr lovers. The mechanism of the latter
sketch is familiar ; but the style is clever
and individual, and Morton is, as usual,
Prank.
A Lapse of Memory and Other Stories, by
Agnes Littlejohn (J. A. Packer, Sydney), is
chiefly remarkable for the colored picture on
its cover, in imitation of the bedizened ex-
teriors of current American fiction. The
contents are one long story and several short
ones, none of which show any traces of story-
telling art. In the first, an old Englishman
and his grand-daughter meet with an accident
while travelling in France. A young English-
man comes to the rescue and conveys them
to the next town, where the old man dies
shortly afterwards. What then was to be
done with the young lady, who knew of no
other friends or relations 1 The doctor sug-
gests a way out, in English which reads like
a Babu translation from the French :
“Mon ami, why not marry ? Me, I would
solve the problem thus. And" for the benefit of
mademoiselle. It is of fortune good you should
be here. She will not be alone—is it not ? Mon
ami, you hesitate. It is of compliment the
highest . . .”
The obliging young man agrees—and in the
subsequent proceedings the convenient long
arm of coincidence is stretched much further
than is quite fair.
Mr. George Crowley, of Sydney, lias been
to Europe. He saw the spot where the
Israelites crossed the Red Sea, also the Bay
of Naples, and many places covered with the
moss of legend. He was then made painfully
aware of the fact that although we have
Sydney Harbor and the Labor party, Aus-
tralia has no Past, and therefore the people
are without any stones or bones to worship.
Crowley’s view of The Old World through
Netc World Spectacles (Turner and Hender-
son) will be of interest to many who have not
seen the Old World. It is honest and told in
homely style ; and would have been better
if some ancient anecdotes had been omitted.
Paul Cupid’s ” Rival Physicians (N.S. W.
Bookstall Co.) slaughtered a few bushinen
in the rough and ready old days ”; but their
felonious efforts were generally frustrated in
ways which ought to amuse the deserving-
citizens for whom such a book is intended.
Arthur Wright tells a melodramatic story
well. A. Rogue’s Luck (Bookstall Co.) pro-
vides a liberal supply of horse-race, fight,
love, murder, and sudden death, vigorously
mixed together, and you could not reason-
ably expect more excitement for Is.
Harold Hansell told some funny stories in
Dewdrop Dandy and At the “ Labour-in-
Vain ” ; but The Plum Street Brethren (T.
C. Lothian) does not advance his reputation.
The humor is of the cheap, machine-made
order.
“Harrison O.” : London Times , in its
Empire Day supplement, publishes an
article, two and a half columns in length,
on “Australian and Maoriland Verse.”
On the whole, the writer, who appears to
have a fair knowledge of his subject, does
our bards justice ; which is more than can
be said of the average Cold Country critic of
our literature, which he mostly hasn’t read.
The writer in the Times speaks truly when
he says : “ For a generation now Australian
verse has been what The Bulletin has made
it. As part of a national propaganda, it has
striven to found an Australian school which
should not be a mere parasitic growth on
English literature.” Of The Bulletin poets,
he says :
They speak their thoughts tersely, can tell a
short story well, and, at their best, have a swing
and an energy that makes their tale glow as it
goes.
Of the writers individually, kind things
are said of Paterson, Quinn, Lawson, Essex
Evans, Arthur H. Adams and Arnold Wall.
The two last-named are both spoken of as
men of whom something should be heard
in the future. The “Not Understood”
fetich receives another blow owing to the
fact that Bracken is not even mentioned
among the Maoriland contingent. The com-
parative weakness of Maoriland verse is
partly accounted for by the writer when he
points out that the country “lacks both a
great desert and a Bulletin.”
And Elsewhere.
JohnP.: The crisis in the English pub-
lishing trade (B. l/7/’O9) cannot be laid
entirely at the door of the sevenpenny, cloth-
bound novel. The corning of fiction in that
guise has really been one of the fruits of the
crisis, which has been hovering about like a
poor relation for some time. The whole
trouble has arisen out of the growing deter-
mination of the British reading public not to
pay 6s. for a novel. Eveleigh Nash, a
London publisher, put the facts somewhat as
follows in the Fortnightly Review over a year
ago :
In the autumn of last year I accepted a novel by
a popular author, for which I paid the sum of
£3OO in advance against a royalty of 20 per cent,
on the selling price, which was six shillings. On
the cheap colonial edition the author was to get
3|d. per copy. I printed 5000 copies of the work,
and sold 2892 at 6s. and 1750 of the cheap edition.
The book cost me £230 to produce and advertise,
so altogether I risked £530. My profit was
£44 16s. 10d., while the author, who took no
financial risk, netted £3OO. I paid another well-
known novelist £l2O in advance on a book of
which I printed 3000 copies. I sold only 1379 at
65., and 1000 of the cheap colonial edition. The
cost of production and advertising was £l6O and
my profit on the transaction was only £ll7s. Bd.
Publishers are nob philanthropists, and if
the public won’t buy 6s. novels something
must be put on the market that it will buy.
Hence the sevenpenny. If an author of
repute is so haughty that he won’t have his
work appear in anything but 6s. dress, well,
the publisher tells him to go and chase him-
self, and immediately looks round for one of
the younger fry who is anxious to get into
print, and doesn’t care how he gets there.
That’s the case, your Honor.

Frank Bullen, in Beyond (Bell), tells an
old-fashioned story of adventure at sea in
the days before steam. The principal charac-
ter is a loutish Cambridgeshire lad who has
dreams of life beyond the narrow horizon of
the village. He was descended from a Yiking,
and proves to have a large measure of the
baresark spirit. Adventures of the most
blood-curdling description meet him on the
voyage to Beyond, which from a narrator of
such respectable and pious character, we
may accept as credible. The hero
sweeps through them all and returns
with a wife and heaps of money, and is happy
ever after as lord of the manor in his
village. The book is disfigured by a number
of misprints. In the gorgeous description of
the girl whom the hero- marries, her eyes are
said to have had in their amazing depths
“ all the yearning, all the motherhood, all,
m fact, that the painters of the ages have
been endeavoring to express of the Master
Delorosa, and have failed.”
♦
Last month Anatole France left Paris for
Buenos Ayres to deliver a series of lectures
on Rabelais. A writer in The Bodleian, who
attended a farewell reception at the novelist’s
villa, says :
.Someone related Mr. Shaw’s story of how he
made the acquaintance of M. France amidst the
excavations at Rome, and how, introduced to Le
Maltre by Signor Boni, Mr. Shaw exclaimed : “I,
too, am a man of genius.” “ I remember the inci-
dent very well,” said M. France. “And it was a
clever remark, for while telling me of his own
genius he made me belieye in mine.”
Characteristic of both.
* * * *
Two more volumes of John Lane’s edition
of Anatole France in English come from the
Roycroft Library. Thais is one of the best
known of his novels. Balthasar is a collec-
tion of seven short stories which have not pre-
viously appeared in English. They are
varied in style, from the delightful fairy tale
“Honey-Bee” to the title story, with its
warm Eastern coloring, and one is a fair
sample of Anatole Thibault’s irony, and so
short that it may be quoted in entirety :
THE CURE’S MIGNONETTE.
In a village of the Bocage I once knew a cure, a
holy man who denied himself every indulgence,
and who cheerfully practised the virtue of renun-
ciation, and knew no joy but that of sacrifice. In
his garden he cultivated fruit trees, vegetables,
and medicinal plants, but fearing beauty even in
flowers, he would have neither roses nor jasmine.
He only allowed himself the innocent luxury of a
few tufts of mignonette, whose twisted sterns, so
modestly flower-crowned, would not distract his
attention as he read his breviary among his cab-
bage plots under the sky of our dear Father in
Heaven.
The holy man had so little distrust of his
mignonette that he would often in passing pick a
spray and inhale its fragrance for a long time.
All the plant asked was to be permitted to grow.
If one spray was cut, four grew in ita place. So
much so, indeed, that, the Devil aiding, the
priest’s mignonette soon covered avast extent of
his little garden. It overflowed into the paths,
and pulled at the good priest’s cassock as
he passed until, distracted by the foolish plant,
he would pause as often as 20 times an hour while
he read or said his prayers.
From springtime until autumn the presbytery
was redolent of mignonette. Behold what we
may come to and how feeble we are ! Not with-
out reason do we say that all our natural in-
clinations lead us towards sin ! The man of God
had succeeded in guarding his eyes, but he
had left his nostrils undefended, and so the
Devil, as it were, caught him by the nose. This
saint now inhaled the fragrance of mignonette
with avidity and lust, that is to say, with that sin-
ful instinct which makes us long for the enjoyment
of natural pleasures, and which leads us into all
sorts of temptations.
Henceforth he seemed to take less delight in
the odors of Paradise and rhe perfumes which are
our Lady’s merits. His holiness dwindled, and
he might, perhaps, have sunk into voluptuousness
and become little by little like those lukewarm
souls which Heaven rejects, had not succor come
to him in the nick of time.
Once, long ago, in the Thebaid, an angel stole
from a hermit a cup of gold which still bound the
holy man to the Vanities of earth. A similar
mercy was vouchsafed to this priest of the Bocage,
A white hen scratched the earth about the
mignonette with such good-will that it all died.
We are not informed whence this bird came.
As for myself, I am inclined to believe that the
angel who in the desert stole the hermit’s cup
transformed himself into a white hen on purpose
to destroy the only obstacle which barred the
good priest’s path towards perfection.
THE ADVENTURERS.
Over the downs in sunlight clear
Forth we went in the spring of the year;
Plunder of April’s gold we sought,
Little of April’s anger thought.
Caught in a copse without defence
Low we crouched to the.rain-squall dense ;
Sure, if misery man can vex,
There it beat on our bended necks.
Yet when again we wander on
Suddenly all that gloom is gone ;
Under and over, through the wood,
Life is astir, and life is good.
Violets purple, violets.white,
Delicate windflowers dancing light,
Primrose, mercury, muscatel,
Shimmer in diamonds round the dell.
Squirrel is climbing.swift.and lithe,
Chiff-chaff whetting his airy scythe.
Woodpecker whirs his rattling rap,
Ringdove flies with a sudden clap.
Rook is summoning rook to build,
Dunnock his beak with moss has filled,
Robin is bowing in coat-tails brown,
Tomtit chattering upside down.
W T ell is it seen that every one
Laughs at the rain and loves the sun ;
We too laughed with the Wildwood crew,
Laughed till the sky once more was blue.
Homeward over the downs we went
Soaked to the heart with sweet content;
April’s anger is swift to fall,
April’s wonder is worth it all.

Here
is the Hub
of Many Merits,
so called because it embodies in one shell
a high gear for the level, a low gear for the
hill, a free wheel on both gears, and a brake of
absolute! efficiency. It was the first hub to demonstrate
the practicability of such a combination, and is to-day the
only one that has successfully and consistently accom-
plished all that has been claimed for it. It is known all over the
world as the
Eadie Two-speed Coaster
and is now manufactured at the famous B.S.A. Works. You know what that
means, you know the world-wide reputation of B.S.A. Goods. If you are an expert
cyclist you are pretty sure to be riding a B.S.A. Bicycle yourself and know the
value of the B.S.A. Trade Mark.
..Any dealer can fit the Eadie Two-speed Coaster to your bicycle. If you have any
difficultj or would like particulars of these and other B.S.A. goods, write for the

SLEEPLESSNESS.
Mr. .James Bell, bootmaker, of 16 Parramatta-
road, Petersham, is not one of the fortunate ones
who escaped the invasion of influenza, which was
experienced in this country afew years ago. Speak-
ing on the subject to our reporter, Mr. Bell said :
“Influenza is a complaint that has singled me
out for attention more than once, as I had an
attack when living in New Zealand, and again in
this country. If there is anything worse for com-
pletely making a wreck of a man, I would like to
know what it is. So far as I am concerned, it
made a thorough hash of my health, and a pretty
tough time I had before I made any headway
against it. The heavy burning pains in my head
were something terrible, for they had the effect of
making me so despondent that I could find no
pleasure in life at all. If a man’s head is not clear
and free from pain, all the money in the world
would not make him happy, and I was far from
ic, believe me. As each day dawned, so were
those wretched aches in attendance, as if for the
purpose of casting a gloom over my life. I£y mouth
was dry and parched, and there waf ft fever-
ishness right through my body, which was most
distressing. Not one of ray limbs was free from
aches of a very tiresome nature —aches that were
positively painful, and when I stood upon my feet
my legs felt as if they would collapse beneath me.
Together with these discomforts was a feeling of
restlessness which served to intensify my unhappi-
ness, for I could not rest contented anywhere for
any length of time, and completely exhausted my-
self in moving about from place to place.”
“It would not take much exertion to tire you,
and you’d be glad to get to bed at night? ”
“Well, for all the sleep I got, I might just as
well have been up and about, for that was one of
the peculiarities of my sickness. Although I felt
so feeble and tired that I could have dropped any-
where, yet when I retired to rest I found much
difficulty in getting to sleep. And I had gone on
m a very bad . y for a considerable time when I
happened to be put on to a medicine that altered
the whole aspect of my affairs. An old employer
of mine from Melbourne saw me one day and
explained how ill he had been from the same com-
plaint as mine, and said that he had been quite
fixed up by Clements Tonic, at toe same time
strongly urging me to get some.”
“ And you put bis advice into effect?”
“lam pleased to say I did, and I consider it
about the best step I ever took in my life, for the
unpleasantnessl was laboringunder began to vanish
from that date. I don’t think I said anything
about the dizzy feelings I used to have when my
head seemed to spin round like a top, neither did
I mention the unsettled state of ray nerves, which
had become quite unhinged, and my appetite had
left me long ago. And the longer my sufferings
existed the greater the feeling of depression became
The lowness of spirits was something terribly
and I hadn’t enough energy td try and shake it
off. Sickness always fetches one down, and, my
word, it succeeded in doing so in my case. My
digestive organs were altogether disarranged, too,
in consequence of which I endured no end of dis-
comfort after swallowing any nourishment. Fains
affected me about the shoulders and the loins, and
in the chest there was an unusual heaviness that
testified to the undigested condition of my food.
But I came to the turn in the road when I began
to employ Clements Tonic, which is easily the
best medicine I have ever had any experience
with. And I think that, as influenza and the
other ailments I suffered from are so frequently
encountered, it is only my duty to tell my fellow
citizens how they can be cured, as I was
Clements Tonic is the'thing. It added strength
to my enfeebled system with each dose, it invigor-
ated my nerves in a way that astonished me; it
brought sleep to my hitherto restless nights; it
provided the appetite that enabled me to eat; and,
finally, it restored my internal organs to that state
of healthfulness which enabled me to digest what-
ever food I did take. Report these facts for
others’ good.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, JAMES BELL, of 716 Parramatta Road, Petersham,
in the State of New South Wales, Commonwealth of

by Clements Tonic, and also contains my full peffrroSion

voluntarily, without receiving any payment; and I make

to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Oaths

[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Of Browning and a Dog.
Marie’s room is warm and cosy,
And I m busy with my Browning.
She’s to listen while I read ;
Bug she sits a-dream and dozy
(Queenly in her splendid gowning),
And she finds it hard to heed.
“A Taccata of Galuppi ”
As I read the rich lines, ringing
With the pathos of the past,
Marie does not hear ; her puppy
Comes, a curious odor bringing—
In her arms she holds him fast.
So I cease to read, and wonder
When “,a lady was a lady,”
Proud in Venice, loved and blest,
Would her ardent beau have shunned her
If a pup-dog, like a baby,
Nestled snugly on her breast?
You were lucky, old Galuppi,
When you played to girl and gallant
In old Venice long ago,
There was no provoking puppy
To display his tricks and talent
Where your music used to flow.
This I’ve settled, old Galuppi,
Marie s poodle must be shunned hence,
Or his life-blood will be shed ;
I w >h have no pampered puppy
On the breast’s superb abundance,
Where I’ve right to base my head.

To Let.
At even e’er the sun was set
-Tall weeds were blowing in the garden bed,
I read the weary sign that said “To Let,”’
I marked the broken windows bleak and dead.
I thought of steps that came and went
Across the rotted threshold of the door,
I he landlord waiting for his weekly rent,
Ihe monthly bills the grinning postman bore.
The cabbage John with yellow smile,
And baskets on his bamboo bobbing low.
Whose broken speech’ was mended with much
guile
The while he counted forth his onions slow.
The man who bore the scroll of blue,
And ever sought to see me face to face,
d hough in his heart of hearts he surely knew
My great soul highly scorned his mission base.
Of these and other feet I thought
Whose boots had crushed the tender, yielding
weed &
By that dear home where rich experience bought
Blossomed to holy calm in thought and deed.
Each eve was full of heavy care,
But care itself I lightly laughed to scorn ;
The world was friend while still I had a pair
Of trousers left to greet the break of morn.
In yonder room I joyed to sit
What time a full exchequer overflowed,
Three days of joyous dalliance, wine and wit,
Ere famine’s grim and ghastly spectre showed.
By yonder casement I have spent
Long, weary days and nights without a smoke,
Despairing nights and days without a cent,
With every echo crying “ He is broke ! ”
Ah, sorry street, I miss you now,
Green garden weeds, you-fragrance all is dead;
Another roof must shade my aching brow,
Three blocks away I have a different bed.’
At even e’er the sun was set
Upon a rubber heel I turned me round,
The grim and battered board that said “To Let ”
Across the twilight made a silent sound.

Penance.
This is my penance; the silence between us
Grey miles of ocean and wind on far beaches ;
Never a touch for the hand that outreaches,
No coming back to the ways that have seen us
(Down by the river in soft April weather,
Green arch of leafage and heads close together).
Always grey miles and an ocean between us !
Ah ! I have gathered the scarlets of Laughter,
Purples of passion, and pearls of soft slumber.
Gathered my woman-joys, sweets without
number,
Reckless of griefs that come stealthily after,
Griefs clad in all the sad black of the mourner
Stretching drear cere-cloths from corner to
corner,
Closing the mouth and the eyelids of Laughter !
Just to hold arms to you ! You, the deceiver !
Just to forget. .. and to live for your kisses !
All that the life of the penitent misses.
that no prayerful days leave
The bliss that she knows must be paid for in
pain.
A moment, dear Lord, to be young once again
Young, in the arms of the well-loved deceiver.
Yet, I have chosen—the ocean between us,
Never a touch from the hand that outre’aches-
The harp-voice of winds on desolate beaches.
(Never footfall in the glades that have seen us,
Palm close to palm, and eyes chained to each
other...
Hurrying breaths that the hot kisses smother.)
Memory ... my penance ... the ocean between us.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tub Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by talcing some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be. addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor. Bulletin.” is the proper
superscription for "copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

A CONGESTED CITY.
Sydney is wrestling with many problems just
now—reconstruction, street-widening, railway
communication, wharfage, the housing of the
people, and all the side issues which hang on to
these matters. And the other day there
projected himself into the riot- a sort of
Vandal, ex-Railway Commissioner Fkhon, who
proposed to solve for a while the question of de-
ficient elbow-room by the simple device of destroy-
ing the city parks —the Botanical Gardens and
the rest—and using the space as building allot-
ments. It was a crude inspiration, and the sug-
gestion , involved no great intellectual strain;
Attila,"' a great many centuries ago, was also
good at destroying parks, and he was only a Hun,
and had never been a Railway Commissioner in
his life. But, after all, Fehon only proposed to
do in one act what is now being done piecemeal
and by instalments. The parks of Sydney
are going. Every now and then a corner
is taken here and a scrap is stolen there,
for this purpose or that. It is noteworthy
that Sydney’s street-widening programme begins
about Elizabeth and Liverpool streets, because
the park is there—the handy park of which a bit
can always be stolen—and thus the cost and worry
of extensive resumptions are saved. Yet park-
stealing only postpones the evil day, and doesn’t
even postpone it for long.
* * * *
Sydney’s problem is the eternal problem of the
great city. The streets must be widened to carry
the traffic, and a system of city railways must be
built for the same purpose. But these things eat
up living space, and make the difficulty of housing
the people even worse than before. Also the
population keeps increasing, and that aggravates
the housing problem. The number of people who
pour daily into the city to toil keeps increasing
likewise, and that aggravates the traffic problem.
If the people live close enough to their work to
avoid lengthy and expensive travelling, the results
are slums, horrible tenement houses, sky-scrapers,
over-crowding', disease, degeneration, stunted
children, idiots and sundries. If they are spread
out so far that they can lead healthy, decent lives,
the outermost fringe is ruined in travelling ex-
penses, and the time spent in going to and fro
becomes a serious loss to folk with whom every
hour means money. Besides, there are limits to
the carrying capacity of railways. Those who
believe in dragging everything to Sydney—in
making the whole State Sydney’s back yard, and
in compressing all the exporting and importing
and most of the manufactures and the finance
of over 300,000 square miles of land on to one
narrow little peninsula —are preparing a stupen-
dous conundrum for themselves and a worse one
for posterity.
In Great Britain the house is the
handy and convenient solution for all difficulties.
A marvellous thing is the tenement house. The
writer still remembers it in all its glory as it
used to stand, and probably still stands, in the
poorer working-men’s localities of Glasgow.
It was generally three or four storeys high,
but this was not an invariable rule; some old
tenement houses in Edinburgh ran to about a
dozen storeys, for the sky-scraper is no modern
invention. This great rabbit warren of humanity
had a common entry. In its cheapest form there
were six or eight or more doors opening off each
landing. Each door led into a house of one room,
and in each house of one room lived one
family—seldom more. Occasionally there in-
truded into this scheme of things an aris-
tocratic domicile of two rooms. There was
one water-tap in each house, and there was
a legend about some sanitary convenience in
the basement; but as a rule nobody ever found it,
and very few people looked for it. And when
one considers all the things that were done
in that one room, by men and women and boys
and girls, it is no wonder that decency died —if a
thing can be said to die that never got a fair
chance to be born. Still the tenement curse
settles the question of the housing of the people.
Its resources in that line are almost unlimited.
Sydney, for instance, puts about 550,000 people on
to 93,094 acres of land, and yet at the centre of
things it finds the congestion growing serious,
and the comings and goings of its suburban popu-
lation strain the resources of its tramway system
almost to breaking point. Birmingham puts a
rather larger population on to 12,G39 acres;
Manchester puts 649 251 people on 12,935 acres ;
Liverpool crams 753,203 people on 13,239 acres ;
Glasgow gets 859,715 people on to 12.382 acres—
-50 per cent, more people than Sydney possesses,
living a horrible existence on about one-eighth
of the space. The county' of London is not
much better than Glasgow. There are 117 square
miles in the county of London, and there were, in
1901, 38,774 persons to each square mile—there
are more now. And this includes some of the
more aristocratic and thinly-peopled areas ; in the
localities where population is really dense the
compression issimply marvellous. Bethnal Green
and .Shoreditch, for instance, run to about 120,000
people to the square mile. As a result of this
condensation into a narrow space, almost every-
body can walk home from his work if he really
wants to, and things are greatly simplified. But
it is in these crowded areas, and in these tene-
ment houses, that the greatness of the British
race promises to find its grave. No really great
people ever lived at the rate of 38,774 humans to
the square mile, much less at the rate of 120,000
to the square mile—or, rather, no people ever
achieved that density and remained great for
any length of time. It is only within the last
50 years that the British people became, in a con-
firmed and incurable fashion a race of suffocated
ants dwelling in great, sunless ant-heaps, and—
well, the scrap Britain put up in the Transvaal
was only the emaciated semblance of the scrap it
put up a century earlier in Portugal and Spain.
Already its living conditions are getting it down.
• * * *
It is, most unhappily, the fixed policy of New
South Wales to devote every effort to the unnat-
ural bloating of Sydney. All the State’s railways
converge there. Traffic has to come there, except
the, small part which can reach Newcastle ; and
special inducements are offered to bring that small
part to Sydney also. Two-thirds of all the State’s
manufactures are in Sydney, for the manufacturer
has to fix himseif, whenever it is possible, at the
point where the railways meet, so that he can send
his goods out in all directions ; the manufacturer at
Newcastle would gain little advantage over the
Sydney one in competing along the northern lines,
and he would be hopelessly handicapped on all the
other railways of the State. The seat of Govern-
ment, and all the State Government offices, and
the principal law-courts, are at Sydney, and the
Federal capital is to be as near it as possible.
Therefore, the city is growing with amazing
rapidity. Out of the 380,766 people who were
added to the population of N.S.W. between 1881
and 1891, no less than 158,344 came to Sydney.
Between 1891 and 1901 the population of N.S.W.
increased by 226,899. and of these 98,547 settled in
Sydney. Between 1901 and 1907, 193,697 people
were added to the census of N.S.W., and 95,350 of
these settled in Sydney. In 1901 Sydney con-
tained 40,000 more people than all the other towns
of N.S.W. put together. It also contained 60,000
more people than the whole rural population of
N.S.W. In 1861 Sydney had 95,000 inhabitants,
and the country population—all the people who
lived outside towns and cities—numbered 189,000 ;
therefore, the country population was then twice
that of Sydney. In 1901 the awful Gospel of Con-
gestion had made such headway that while the
population of Sydney was 481,000 that of the
country districts was only 422,000. The One
Bloated City had in 1861 half as large a population
as the country ; in 1901 it had beaten the country
badly. And so long as the arrangements of rail-
ways and railway rates are devised to bring every-
thing to Sydney, all the pretences about breaking
up the big estates, and settling the people on the
land, are mere hypocrisy and sham. It is the
natural result of this Congested Population Policy
that the housing and traffic problems of the
N.S.W. metropolis are becoming acute. Thesaid
problems may be summarised as follows :
A large class of workers—such men, for instance, as
wharf laborers, who are liable to sudden calls at all
manner of hours —must live close to the scene of their
employment; and the more the work and trade of N.S. \V.
are crowded into one bloated city the larger this class
becomes.
At the same time, as the city becomes more and more
occupied by shops, warehouses, offices, Wharves, factories
and so on,"and the more ground is eaten up by railways,
railway yards and street-widening operations, the less
room there is for this increasing class.
Other workers may live out of town provided there are
enough railways to carry them, and the trains are fast
enough so that too much time isn’t eaten up in going
to and fro, and the fares are low enough to make the
travelling possible. That means that there must in time
be a large expenditure on new suburban lines; that the
trains must be run probably at a loss ; and that a lot of
valuable land must be wasted by being set aside for
lines that wouldn’t be needed but for the lamentable
congestion policy.
- 4t * ■*
In this matter Australia, if it insists on sticking
to the bloated city policy, must solve its own
problem—the problem of having a very large
urban population which lives under sane and
healthy conditions. There are no precedents to
goon—not even in Britain where the Australian
Tory always goes to search for his precedents.
The only proposition that Britain has to offer is
the slum, and the tenement house, and the great
idea of crowding 120,000 people on to one square
mile of land. As the first step towards dealing
with the difficulty, Australians should make the
building of a tenement house a capital offence..
It is the beginning of a nation’s inevitable down-
fall, this herding of 24 families in one building ;
and it is the end of modesty, decency, cleanliness
and self-respect. As an attempt to propose some-
thing in the way of a remedy, The Bulletin pro-
pounds the theory that the Australian States should
abandon the craving to ha veonebloa ted arid gigantic
city in each State, and should start life afresh.
Taking N.S.W. as an example, it is hereby sug-
gested that a direct line of railway should be built
to each one of the few good ports which the State
possesses, and that railway rates should be care-
fully adjusted with a view to directing the trade
of each district to the most convenient port —in
other words, that an effort should be made to
have six moderate-sized seaports instead of one
bloated monster and a wilderness. Furthermore,
it is proposed that the State capital, with all its
offices and appurtenances, should be removed from
Sydney to some inland town, such as Bathurst
or Orange, thus following the United States
idea whereby the capital of New York
State is not New York, but Albany; and
Harrisburg, with 55,000 people, is the capital
of Pennsylvania instead of Philadelphia with
1,441,000 people; and Springfield, with 39,000
people —not gigantic Chicago of the meat-tins and
the slaughtered hogs—is the political centre
of Illinois ; and Sacramento, instead of San
Francisco or Los Angeles, is the political
centre of California. It would also propose that
the Federal capital should be placed as far as
possible from Sydney, instead of as close as
possible to it. It would do all that is possible to
encourage manufactures in country towns, and
abandon the policy which has compressed two-
thirds of the State’s industries into one over-
burdened metropolis. And then, as the city would
still grow in spite of everything, it would pro-
pound the idea that the 40 or so municipalities
should be consolidated into a Greater Sydney ;
that a great work of reconstruction, street-
widening and slum demolition should be set on
foot; and that the. creation of a comprehensive
suburban railway system should be undertaken so
that the evicted slum-dweller might be able to go
and live a better life in some airy suburb. But
above all things it would, as already mentioned,
make the attempt to build a tenement house or
anything dimly resembling it punishable with
death—the more so that the apartment house,
which is the natural predecessor of the other
thing, is already with us. For, as hereinbefore
indicated, the tenement house is a hell and the
burial place of a people’s greatness.
GREATER SYDNEY-OR THE PRACTI-
CAL ABOLITION OF CIVIC GOVERN-
MENT.
An official body was lately appointed to consider
the towsled, tangled, confused, old-young, pre-
maturely-aged metropolis of N.S.W., and to
decide what improvements its case called for. It
recognised clearly, to begin with, that Sydney
might easily be the show city of the world, if it
were not that man has spoiled what God created.
The specially-appointed authority presented a
report dealing with the most urgent and necessary
improvements in the way of widening, straighten-
ing, and extending old streets, making new
streets, demolishing, slums, clearing away un-
sightly hoardings, destroying battered and insani-
tary old dwellings, and generally raising the
municipal Lazarus from the dead. And then all
these great schemes brought up with a shock
against the old difficulty at the bottom of the old
cul-de-sac. If Sydney was governed by one
authority, that body could devise a compre-
hensive scheme of improvement which would
make it what it ought to be—the Queen City
of the Southern Hemisphere. But when everything
has to be referred to 42 mayors, and as many town
clerks, and herds of aldermen, to say nothing of
half a dozen other authorities, agreement is almost
impossible. If the 42 mayors constituted a sort
of Parliament in which the decision of 22 mayors
and mobs of aldermen could overrule the opposi-
tion of 20 mayors and gangs of aldermen, the
matter would 1 e comparatively simple. But
when one cantankerous municipal body, if it
happens to be located in the wrong place, can
block a great scheme of improvement, the position
of affairs becomes just about hopeless.
The Sydney and suburban mayor and council
are poor helpless creatures, simply because of this
division of authority. They don’t control the
tramways, and consequently don't get the tram-
way profits, because 42 different and separate
tramway systems are obviously absurd; so
because of the rows and discrepancies of
the numerous local authorities, the State railway
department runs this business. The trams ought
to be a purely Sydney affair, but because
Sydney can’t agree and can’t stop chewing its
brothers municipal ear, the man at Hungerford,
or Tenterfield or Albury has as much say in the
management of Redfern’s private means of con-
veyance as the inhabitant of Redfern himself.
The lighting of Sydney is mostly in private hands,
because it is easier to have one private gas com-
pany than 42 separate municipal gas-works, or
perhaps 31 gas-works and 10 electric lights and
one oil-lamp; and Sydney has to allow some
humble trifle of £120,000 or so per annum of profits
to go to private shareholders simply because its 42
mayors can’t part with their 42 miserable little
dignities. The hydraulic power business, and the
very handsome profits thereof had to go to a
private company because hydraulic power can’t
stop at the artificial line where the importance of
one mayor’s gold chain ends and the awful dignity
of another’s ’possum-skin robe begins. The water
and sewerage business, and the takings attached
thereto, are in the hands of a Government
department, because a water and , sewerage
scheme has to be laid out on comprehensive
principles, and the idea of persuading 42 inde-
pendent and cantankerous authorities to agree to
any comprehensive principle—especially as the
decision of the majority can be in no way binding
on the minority—is plainly absurd. The harbor
is controlled by a separate Trust because the
various waterside municipalities can’t agree ; and
the Fire Brigades Board is still another protest
against all this divided and sub-divided authority.
Sydney has had to let so many profitable muni-
cipal enterprises pass under State control or go
over to private enterprise through the inability of
its horde of municipal functionaries to come
to an understanding, that there is little
left for its suburban aldermen to do save
describe each other as liars and call on
each other to ‘‘ come outside and say it again.”
And bad as things are now they threaten to
become even worse. There is talk of new cattle
sale-yards and abattoirs for the supply of Sydney ;
they are to be located at Homebush and
they are either to belong to the one muni-
cipality of Sydney or to be managed by
a Board, because the shoal of mayors and
the great dust-storm of aldermen are too
numerous for any practical purpose. And the last
straw is the great scheme for the improvement and
partial reconstruction of Sydney. The increase
of slums ; the increasing congestion of the narrow
streets ; the lack of long, straight, wide highways
which will march from end to end of the N.S.W.
metropolis, regardless of the dozen artificial and
invisible lines which delimit the jurisdictions of
Mayor Smith and Mayor Jones, and Mayors
Brown, Robinson, Levy, Jorkins, and all the
rest, have become a trouble that can’t be over-
looked. And it is plainly impossible to get
all the mayors and aldermen to agree as to (1) what
new streets require to be made; (2) their width; (3)
their direction; (4) the apportionment of the
expense. So Sydney is at a deadlock again. The
only visible remedy, if all the present municipali-
ties are to remain, is to appoint still another
Board— a Qity Improvement and Reconstruction
Board—with power to invade all municipalities,
resume and tear down buildings, tear up streets,
levy rates, and generally play havoc with the
whole municipal show. And when Sydney is con-
trolled by (1) the Railway Department as owner
of the tramways; (2) the Water and Sewerage
Board ; (3) the Gas Co.; (4) the Hydraulic Power
Co. ; (5) the Harbor Trust; (6) the Fire Brigades
Board ; (7) the Board that has charge of the cattle
saleyards and abattoirs; (8) the City Improve-
ment and Reconstruction Board ; and (9) several
other casual authorities, it is difficult to see what
the 42 mayors and the many hundred aldermen will
have to do. It begins to look as if too much
Local Government would end by leaving Sydney
with no Local Government at all, and making it
a mere jungle and. wilderness of Boards and
private enterprise monopolies.
* » * *
As a natural result, the Greater Sydney ques-
tion arises more insistently than ever. Of
course, the bulk of the 42 mayors are against it,
for it would mean that 41 of them must go. And
the bulk of the 42 town clerks are hostile, for no
town clerk', even if, like the person at Darlington,
he only town-clerks for 44 acres of ground with
736 houses on the whole area, wants to go. And
the great majority of the great horde of aldermen
are hostile, for a scheme which would reduce the
clamorous multitude of aldermen by about 75 per
cent, can’t be expected to appeal to the alder-
manic class. But it is fairly probable that the
people, if they had a chance to express themselves
clearly and definitely by a referendum, would
declare solidly for a Greater Sydney. Certainly
the aldermen and mayors mostly declare that the
people are hostile; but that is no reason why a
referendum should not be taken. If the people
are really hostile, then the numerous aldermen
and mayors will be vindicated, and no one can
object to being vindicated. If the people are not
hostile, then a good many aldermen and mayors
will be shown to be liars, and if anybody is a liar
in a matter of public interest it is as well that the
fact should be demonstrated.
* * * *
By way of a rough sketch of the possibilities of
the case, the following scheme is propounded :
(1) That the N.S.W. Parliament should pass an Act
declaring all the two score or thereabouts municipalities
of Sydney and its suburbs to be incorporated under the
control of a Greater Sydney Council, with control over
roads, streets, parks, cleaning, lighting, hydraulic power,
tramways, wharves, and other matters relating to the
harbor, fire brigades, resumptions, improvements, mar-
kets, cattle saleyards, slaughterhouses, sewerage, water
supply (if practicable), public baths, garbage destructors,
nuisances, hospitals, and anything else which seems nt
and proper. ~ ,
(2) That councillors should be paid on the same scale
as members of Parliament, and that the Greater Sydney
Council should have power to delegate its duties to com-
mittees for the more expeditious management of affairs.
(3; That the new Council should take over from each
existing Council all its revenue-producing assets at a
valuation, and pay for them by assuming a corresponding
proportion of the existing Councils’ debts.
(4) That the remaining debts should be regarded as the
separate liabilities of the old municipalities, and a special
rate be levied on each municipality, varying according to
the amount of its debt, in order to extinguish all the
liabilities at the same date. This rate to be quite separ-
ate and apart from the general rate levied by the Greater
Si dney Council.
(5) That, until the old debts are extinguished, the old
municipal boundaries should be preserved, each of the old
municipalities forming a ward of Greater Sydney, with
representation according to its population. When the
old debts are paid off the.oid municipal boundaries should
be abolished, and the city laid out into wards on a more
rational plan.
(6) That, notwithstanding the necessity of keeping a
separate record of the old debt, all the debts of all the 4-.
municipalities should be undertaken by the Greater
Sydney Council, which would repay, renew and consoli-
date them as occasion offered. And whenever the Greater
Sydney Council was able, by reason of its superior credit,
to renew and consolidate a loan at reduced interest, the
municipality to which the loan belonged should have the
full benefit of the saving.
(7) That the Act should be submitted, in each muni-
cipality, to a vote of all persons qualified to vote at Par,
liamentary elections. Those municipalities in which the
Act was accepted should form the original municipality
of Greater Sydney. Those in which it was rejected should
be given an opportunity of voting on the subject afresh
at the date of each Parliamentary election, until they also
joined the Greater Sydney movement.
« * * *
There are a multitude of details to be filled in
of which space will not admit here. But the
essentials are : (1) To devise a Constitution which
will make Greater Sydney a municipality based
on a perfectly democratic suffrage, and with the
widest powers which any municipal authority can
ask for; (2) to devise a method whereby the old
municipalities can come in without financial in-
justice to any of them and with profit to all;
and (3) to make the acceptance or rejection of the
scheme wholly dependent on the people, elimina-
ting mayors, aldermen, town clerks, and other
interested parties except in the sense that each ot
them would have one vote in the matter like any
other private citizen. This has become a matter
of urgency, for either Greater Sydney must cojne to
pass or else municipal government must almost
wholly die out. There are so many public services
which cover a large space, and which can t be ie
to the local councils because of the impossibility o
getting so many mayors and aldermen to e
unanimous—or at least to become unanimous
within any reasonable time —that civic govern
ment is perishing, and in its place is com ? f
government by Boards and private companies.
And if, for want of a Greater Sydney, ,
work of reconstruction and improvement ha -
to be delegated to a Board, with power to mvaae
municipalities, resume properties, widen !l "
align streets, make new streets, levy lmprov
rates, put up new buildings on resumed lan >
soon, there will hardly be enough civic g
ment left to be worth seriously alluding to.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
More Yassberra-isms.
It would seem that a part of the price which
Alfred Deakin paid for the Joe Cook alliance
was the final abandonment of the Monaro site for
the Federal capital and an agreement to place the
city vvhere it will be conveniently within the range
and influence of the Sydney Tory dailies that
support Cook. The other day,' McDougall,
M. H.R., propounded some questions on the
subject, and got these replies :
1 and 2. I would refer the honorable member to the
report of the Advisory Board in connection with the
I< ederal Capital site at Yass-Canberra, w hich report was
printed on the 23rd ultimo ; also to the report on the
same subject by the Chief Engineer for Harbors and
Water Supply, New South Wales, which will be tabled
this afternoon, which states that there is ample water
supply at Yass-Canberra to meet the requirements of a
large settlement.
3. The Seat of Government Act 1903 provides that the
Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be in the
district of Yass-Canberra.
Now, the first of the documents so proud pre-
ferred to was the report of the Advisory Board
specially appointed by the Australian Government
todeal with the matter, and thefourmembersthere-
of said that the Cotter Creek could only be relied
upon as a permanent supply for an up-to-date city
of 50,000 people, and that the other two creeks
thereabouts were something very like an un-
known quantity. The second document alluded
to was a report by one man whom the
Federal Government hadn't apparently author-
ised to deal with the matter —it represented
the cheeky butting-in of one of Wade’s State
Departments to boost Wade’s favorite site, or the
favorite site of the daily papers which keep Wade
in office. This declared that the Cotter would
supply water enough for 1,300,000 people. Seem-
ingly the Yassberra party proposes to bluff its
wretched site through, either by ignoring the
utterly hostile report of the four officers whom it
appointed and refusing to consider anything save
the highly-colored statements of the N.S.W.
State Department which rushed into the discus-
sion, or by shamelessly professing to believe that
its four appointees gave a highly favorable
account of the place, when it knows perfectly
well that they didn’t. It takes a tremendous
nerve to do a thing like that, but the Fused Gov-
ernment seems to be starting on the job. Of
course it is quite true, as alleged in the last para-
graph of the reply above quoted, that the Seat of
Government Act fixes the capital at Yassberra.
It is also true, as not mentioned in the reply, that
the Act was helped through by the most shame-
less lying as to the resources of the locality, and
no report like that of the Advisory Board was
then before Parliament. In any case, a place
which is so wildly variable that four authorised
experts declare there is only a reliable water
supply for 50,000 people, while one unauthorised
one dashes in with the assertion that there is
water for 1,300,000, certainly calls for some
further inquiry. The discrepancy is too awful.
Yet it would seem that the Fused Push
means to rush the job through without any
further inquiry, if the thing can be managed. The
Sydney morning papers require a capital at Yass-
berra, inside their business radius. And the
Fused Crowd requires tiie support of the Syduey
morning papers. In this matter everything seems
to be carefully thought of and provided for—
except the interests of Australia.
The White Man in the Tropics.
One day last .week the Sydney Telegraph had a
sudden burst of despondency about the white
man’s prospects, and, while sunk in the depths of
gloom, it published an article entitled *’A Lesson
from South America.” The chief hunk of misery
is contained in this extract
Out of a total of 45,000,000 inhabitants, scarcely one-
fifth are of a pure white race. In Venezuela, Colombia,
and Bolivia the whites form less than 10 per cent, of the
population. Even in Brazil they form only 40 per cent.
In the Argentine the white and colored inhabitants are
about equally divided. Chili has a homogeneous popula-
tion of mixed blood. It appears, therefore, that-the
work of developing the equatorial and tropical region of
South Ainerca has been done almost exclusively by colored
people, while the percentage of the pure white race in the
general population increases as the traveller passes south
until it reaches its maximum in the Argentine, where it
is reinforced now by a steady flow of immigration, mostly
from Southern Europe. The problem of how to keep
Australia white is not rendered easier by a survey of the
tropical region of the South American continent, which
wan colonised by a proud white race that stamped its
language and a portion of its civilisation on the country,
and then passed away, unable to survive the mysterious
law which seems to decree that the pure white race cannot
flourish in the tropics.
There is something curious about this logic; it
seems the proud \vhite race that conquered tropical
South America “ passed away, unable to survive
the mysterious law which seems to decree that
the pure white race cannot flourish in the
tropics,” and yet a few sentences before it was
set forth that the proud white is still there. But
this discrepancy may be charged against the
depression which had plainly got the old paper
down that day. In reality, there is nothing in
the State of South America to justify any feeling
of alarm re the future of the white man in tropical
Australia. The cases are not parallel. A few
centuries ago, when Spain and Portugal made
their great splash, they had a joint population
estimated at about 9,000,000 —not so very much
more than Greater London has now. With this
force they spread themseives out to conquer the
best part of North America (the old vice-royalty
of Mexico once extended as far north as what is
now the Canadian border), also Guatemala, San
Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Guiana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
Bolivia, Chili, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uru-
guay, Patagonia, Cuba, Jamaica, Porto Rico, and
the West Indies generally, Ceylon, part of India,
the Philippines and a great number of other
isles in the East Indies, a bit of China, a whole
lot of Africa, some of Polynesia, also Italy ; like-
wise to hold the hostile Netherlands, to influence
Germany, to repress the Turks (then in the height
of their power), to beat down France in a series
of stupendous wars, and to tight all-comers at sea.
Furthermore, Spain sent help to the Irish patriots,
and seriously attempted the conquest of England.
The doings of these two peninsular States were
stupendous, considering the means at their com-
mand. The Spanish nation especially spread itself
out so thin that it had to try to hold some places
that are now sizable South American republics
with two or three hundred men. When it
started on the greatest of all its conquests (that of
the Mexican empire), it could send barely 1200
soldiers on the expedition ; and in those strenuous
days it threw, 100 men in the face of the
great Peruvian Kingdom. The fact that in
Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia one-tenth of
the people are to-day of pure Spanish descent
shows how remarkably the white race, beginning
from almost nothing, has increased and multiplied
in the tropics. If the Spaniard of the tropics
doesn’t cut the figure he did, it must be remem-
bered that he hasn’t fallen any further than the
Spaniard in cold Spain, and he hasn’t fallen
nearly so far as the Portuguese in temperate
Portugal. Various things told against the men
of the Peninsula. They lacked, to some extent,
the self-governing capacity, as is evidenced in
Portugal to-day. They uever drew the color line
as the Anglo-Saxon did, but their unfortunate
tendency to inter-marry with colored races was
more strongly evidenced in Portugal than even in
tropical America. Worst of all, the two little
nations wore themselves out and qualified for 1000
years in hospital by breaking their backs and their
hearts over ambitions 20 times too large for their
resources. Such cases are common in history.
Macedonia was a debilitated wreck all the rest of
its days after its gigantic effort to conquer Asia.
Sweden made a stupendous attempt to conquer all
Central Europe; it fought Russia, Poland, and
the German Empire; it annexed most of what
is now Prussia, and its King had serious thoughts
of invading Britain and dethroning the Guklphs
when the country suddenly doubled up. It hasn’t
been out of the infirmary since, though it occasion-
ally can be noticed sitting on the balcony on a
sunny afternoon. Denmark nas just beenable toget
about on two sticks since its famous conquest of
England and its great invasion of Ireland. But
though theSpanishand Portuguese peoples broke up
mentally and physically through starting too early
and trying to conquer the world when they had
hardly enough men to garrison their own coun-
tries, that has nothing to do with the question of
white settlement in tropical lands. Despite
furious civil wars, brought on by his incapacity
for self-government, the Spaniard has multiplied
greatly in the hot places of the earth, and where
he has kept his white blood pure he shows no
deterioration as compared with his brother in
Europe. But there were not enough of him to
start with ; his mother country had so few people
that if the whole nation had migrated to the
Spanish colonies it would have been lost in one
odd corner of the vast expanse ; and the nation
which is born of a parent with a broken back—
broken through trying to lift too much in thedays
of early youth—-doesn’t get a fair start in life.
The Greywashing of Thomas Bent.
The heinousness of Thomas Bent’s Premiership
in Victoria is practically put beyond question by
the summing up of his own partisan judge, the
Melbourne Argus, on the report of the Vic.
Parliamentary Commission appointed to deal
gently with his land transactions. Thus the pro-
Bent newspaper, in directing its Tory readers to
acquit the defendant of any charge of having par-
ticipated in the benefits arising “from the pur-
chases by the Crown ” :
In regard to one case after another, the Commission
finds Mr. Thomas Bunt had no pecuniary interest in the
land at the date of purchase. There, however, satisfac-
tion ends. The facts disclosed and the findings of the Com-
mission upon them demonstrate the imprudence of
several of these purchases, and the extravagance of the
price which the State was made to pay. Exactly as
courts should not only be just, but should preserve'the
appearance of justice, so we are entitled to require that
there should be not only purity of administration on the
part of Ministers, but nothing to suggest impurity. It
is impossible to maintain that Mr. Bunt ade-
quately fulfilled the latter requirement in the various
land transactions into which he led the State. As
regards details, it is recorded against him that he
did not frankly tell Parliament that he was the
owner of certain land near which the proposed electric
tramway to Brighton would run. He stated that he had
no land near the Red Bluff ; but he did not go on to stale,
as he should have done, that he had an interest in some
land two miles from the Red Bluff, which would be
enhanced in value by the tramway for which he was the
principal advocate. It is unquestionable that Mr.
Best did many things during his regime, which would
have fully justified Parliament in dismissing him from
office The most regrettable feature about the
affair, so far as public life is concerned, is that the charges
of corruption should ever have been made.
So apparently, the most that can be fairly
said for Bent is that the public charges against
him were not proven. In even the Argus
apologies there are accusations which amount
to condemnations. And the admission that
Parliament should have dismissed Bent from
office many times over is a droll satire on the
apologies anyhow. The Argus doesn’t offer
excuses for Bent’s suspicious-looking practices by
condemning Parliament for having excused them
so many times. The House did at last get rid of its
amazing Premier, whereas the Argus never
wanted to shift him. But having got rid of him,
the House for the most part was anxious to justify
its toleration of Bent by getting him white-
washed. And the sophistical comments of the
Argus cannot conceal the fact that the intended
whitewash was only gteywash after all.

Waiting for a Report.
The favorite dodge of t|ie Tired Government is to
send an official away to inspect European methods.
It gains time and lets the Tired Government have
another long rest. Also it looks well. The Tired
Government knows that things are askew, but it
professes to want not merely to improve them,
but to do such desperate and wholesale improve-
ment as to make them the best of their kind on
earth ; so a costly official is sent to make stupen-
dous investigations as to how the same sort of
things are done abroad, and, pending his return,
nothing happens. If anybody wants to have
something happen to go on with he is told that it
is best to wait till the official comes back with his
report, so that everything may happen at once.
Premier Weary, of Victoria, is deeply attached
to this device, and he has sent an inspector-
general to Europe to report about up-to-date
docks and wharves and harbor improvements for
Melbourne. (This is the second “ report ”on the
same subject; the first one was just put away
in a box because everybody was too tired to
do anything with it.) When the official has got the
biggest possible wheelbarrowful of information, he
is to lay it before an English engineer who probably
never saw Melbourne, and come back with a
scheme. Meanwhile, the disgraceful Port of
Melbourne still muddles along under four or five
independent, costly, hostile, nagging, antiquated
authorities, and John Weary might fill in time
while his officer is away by creating a single
authority of young, capable men to take charge
of the port, the river, the wharves—in fact, to
run the whole show. But John doesn’t. He
might also revise the absurd scale of charges, and
try to stop the wholesale inuddleand thieving on the
wharves, and take a careful look at the antiquated
pilot service ; but he doesn’t. Melbourne doesn’t
own a single dock large enough for the repair of a
fair-sized coastal vessel, and Premier Weary
might take some healthy exercise digging out a
new dock, even if the equipment of it is left till
his inspector-general returns with the latest news;
but that would be quite unlike John Weary.
He might even get to work on the famous
straight cut, which is so badly required, to
enable Melbourne to dispense with the crooked
Yarraand the absurd Coode Oanal —the result of
previous reliance on British experts—but he isn’t
going to do anything. In fact, as a curious side
issue of the case, the English engineer with whom
Davidson is to consult is the partner of the same
Goode who made such a silly and ruinous hush of
Melbourne's port in other days, and he will
presumably feel bound to swear by the old
hash. And when, in the dim future, John
Weary’s official comes back with a great flabber-
gasting report, drawn up by people who probably
never saw Melbourne, and a scheme for £8,000,000
worth of improvements, the amount will look such
a heap when it is all mentioned at once that pro-
bably nothing will be done at all. Besides,
Premier Weary will probably be out of office by
that time. In like manner Australia’s military
defence seems to be hung up till Kitchener conies
here to report, and there is no certainty that he
will ever come at all. Possibly the taking over of
the Northern Territory will yet be suspended till
an expert goes to Austria and reports on how that
country took over Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Austria having the latest experience in the taking
over line of business. Almost everything in Aus-
tralia seems to be waiting till somebody reports.
Dash all these reports.
The Great Sup-press.
The text of this little sermon will be found in the
following extract from a Melbourne paper :
It was announced yesterday in the Criminal Court that
the Attorney-General had entered a nolle prosequi in the
case of the youth Arthur. Wilkinson, charged with
robbery under arms. The youth has been tried twice in
connection with the sticking-up of the Victoria Park sta-
tion, and the juries have disagreed. Representations were
made to the Attorney-General that, as there was room
for doubt about the identification, it would be harsh to
send the youth for trial a third time. The Attorney-
General accepted tins view, and entered a nolle prosequi.
The case of Joun Francis Deacon and James Gavaoan
has also been mentioned during the present sittings.
These men have been tried three times on a charge of
having inflicted grievous bodily harm on a railway inquiry
officer named Harry Hussey. It is not usual to send an
accused for trial more than a third time, and this view
has been urged upon the Crown law authorities by the
men’s legal advisers. The Attorney-General was not
satisfied that the prosecution should be abandoned ; .but
he consented to the case standing over until next month, in
order that further inquiry might be made.
The foregoing par casts gloomy reflections on the
working of the jury system in Melbourne. The
case of the two men charged with brutally assault-
ing a railway inquiry officer is specially unsatis-
factory. They have been three times tried and
not convicted nor acquitted, yet the Crown Prose-
cutors are seemingly so confident of their evidence
as to be “ not satisfied that the prosecution should
be abandoned.” In short, the Crown leaves the
public to infer that in eacli of three juries some
of the members were unfit for their position,
either because they couldn’t understand the
evidence or were predetermined to vote for the
acquittal of the prisoners. Seeing that stories of
jury intimidation, jury bribing, and tamperings
with- the jury panel are commonly. whispered
about the Criminal Court, the “ further inquiry ”
that the Attorney-General talks of ought to be
conducted by a committee of wideawake men
who know where to go for information of a “shady”
character. The public is pretty much in the
dark concerning what happens in the police-
courts, or even the higher courts. Only cases of
no public importance—the pitiful social scandals
—are glaringly reported in the press. When the
jury disagrees, or the prisoner is acquitted, there
is apt to be a hushing up of the very details which
ought to invite public notice. For instance, the
recent case of a decently-dressed woman charged
with stealing three packets of spoons from an iron-
monger’s shop. The artful theft happened to be
detected by a boy, who informed a salesman of it
after the woman had gone. The salesman, going
in pursuit of her, found her doing some more
shopping at a bookseller's near by. She was then
handling a book whilst the assistant’s back was
turned, and, seeing that she had been tracked,
she adroitly slipped the parcels of spoons into the
book, and protested her innocence. The missing
goods were discovered, the woman was arrested,
Pukves, K.C., was engaged to defend her, and
the plea of sudden “kleptomania” was accepted
by the jury. Case not fully reported. On the
same day a young fellow was charged with assault-
ing a damsel under the age of consent, who
was looking for somebody to father her baby
upon. She admitted to having been “willing” on
several occasions with sundry young fellows what
time she was a junior teacher in a State school.
And she admitted that she had been dismissed
from school teaching because she fed the minds of
her infant charges with indecent pictures. Where-
upon the Judge directed the jury to acquit the
prisoner. This matter of grave public concern
was piactically sup-pressed.
♦
Up-to-Date Education.
Premier Murray’s new Education Bill, now
before the Victorian Assembly, premises many
needed reforms; but, like many other promising
measures, its effect will depend on efficient ad-
ministration. Briefly, it proposes to place the
whole care of the State’s education system in the
hands of a council of 18. This council is to consist
of representatives of the department, the regis-
tered schools, the University, the Technical
schools, the artistic and musical elements, and
the commercial, agricultural, manufacturing and
mining interests ; and it is to keep an eye on
education in other countries, and educational
development generally. Continuing the existing
State school system, the State is to be parcelled
out into high school districts, whose educational
establishments are to be administered much
as are the present technical schools — i.e., chiefly
by the local municipal councils. A new principle
is that these councils are to find one-third of the
funds. Where technical schools are not in exist-
ence, high schools are to be established for even-
ing classes, and they are to pay special attention
to scientific, manual, and technical' instruction.
These schools are to be attended compulsorily by
all boys between 14 and 17 for six hours per week-.
If a secondary school is already in existence, and
is efficiently staffed and equipped, it may take
the place of a high school, provision being made
for special sets of scholarships. Penalties are
provided for parents or employers who directly or
indirectly prevent the attendance of youths at
these continuation schools. As to the primary
schools, attendance is to be compulsory on every
day that the school is open (not four days out of
five, as at present). No exemption may be granted
from attendance to any child under 14 except
by the Minister, and then only on account of
sickness, poverty of parents, or of having obtained
the “merit” certificate. Also, any person em-
ploying a child at a time when he or she ought to
be at school will be guilty of an offence ; and (this
is specially for the sweating dairy farmers)
persons employing children before school hours (it
should be “after” as well) for the purpose of
trade or gain, the nature and extent of which are
such as to prevent the child from profitably taking
part in the school work of the day, will also be
guilty of an offence. One provision is obviously
framed in the interests of a small section of the
community—the Mildura fruit-growers: “The
Minister may, by general or particular order,
suspend the compulsory attendance clauses in any
district at any season of the year.” Except
for that provision, it is a good Bill, especi-
ally as it further gives the Minister
power to establish schools for confirmed
truants, to provide for the education of deaf,
dumb and blind children, and to arrange for the

Hen;
And, as he chews,
Endeavors to peruse
The news
In some wise publication, printing views
That no right-thinking man could grumble at;
And, having scoffed the egg,
His hat
He reaches from its peg ;
Perambulates the Socialistic path—
But that
Annoys him just as little as the bath.
Tho’ both essentially are Sosh’s works,
He never shirks
Their use ;
But much abuse
Of Socialist ideas, without excuse,
Flavors his conversation in the train
The Socialistic train.
But here, again,
He is not heard to murmur or complain
Against the train.
At length the hour
Of ten
Strikes in the Socialistic tower ;
And then
He gains
His office and enquires
For letters and for wires.
Nor e’en complains
They reach him thro’ a Socialistic post.
There are a host
Of letters—quite a pile—
Some from his friends
(Ah ! See him smile).
Cursing the Labor party’s aims and ends.
Here is a note
Bidding him be content and of good cheer,
For, in the House last night, the Fusion vote
Defeated Labor on the Telephone
Discussion. Wherefore charges won’t be near
As dear
As he had cause to fear.
And that reminds him. He rings ou the ’phone,
And tells a friend
At t’other end
That Socialism’s better left alone.
Says it emphatically thro’ the ’phone—
The Socialistic ’phone—
That instrument
The Government is running at a loss
Of very much per cent.
He knows that it is so.
But is he cross ?
No!
He’s quite content. . . .
So, through the day
He goes Ins anti-Socialistic way.
Round and about
The town,
Wearing the Socialistic pavement out;
Riding in Socialistic trams
And damning damns
When Socialism’s mentioned—with a frown. , . .
As night comes down,
He scorns the Socialistic atmosphere
Of a plain pub
And beer,
And seeks his club.
While here
He drinks
And tells his fellow members what he thinks
About the “ Labah pavvty ” and its claims
And visionary aims.
They languidly remark “Hear, hear.” , . .
Then out once more.
And, in a Socialistic tram and train.
On to suburbia, and home again
To his own door.
Then to his bed ;
Laying his wise and proper-thinking head
In downy pillow deep.
He is about to drop
To sleep
When—“ Flop .. . Flop .. .
Flop” . . .
What's that f
The cat,
Chasing an individualistic rat?
Nay, ’tis the footfall of the midnight cop,
Echoing through
The stilly night,
Telling that I and you
Are guarded in our right;
He guards the persons and the propertee
Of you and me.
He's a Socialistic institution too—
The man in blue.
No wonder William Sikes
Dislikes
The whole blue Socialistic crew ....
I wish he’d keep
Still, that cop,
I want to go to sleep.....
Why does he keep
Flop, flop, flop !
With his big feet
Along the street?
Why can’t he stop ?...
His Socialistic feet....
Along the Socialistic street....
Why don’t he change his beat ?...
Of all the rows I ever heard—
Upon my word !
When you stop to think of it
A bit,
This Socialistic business is absurd !

The Englishmen were lucky to make a
draw of the fourth test struggle. But an appeal
at the right moment —not to the umpire, but to
D.C.L., the whisky of the wise—makes possible
the otherwise impossible. The aid of the scholarly
brand to anyone in a tight corner is better than a
free cab or a free feed to a tired Fed. legislator *
medical inspection of all children. The draft-
ing and passing of the Bill into law will be mere
trifles, though, compared with the proper and
thorough carrying of it out ; but so far as they
have gone, or can go at present. Premier Murray
and his Education Minister Billson deserve
thanks for a seemingly honest attempt to bring
young Australia up to the front rank, and keep
him there, instead of letting him drift to the
back, where are the hewers of wood and drawers
of water.
A Crooked Railway.
Last Tuesday the Sydney Telegraph generously
gave space to a map and letter by one Alex.
Wilson, who barracks enthusiastically for the
deviation of the Northern Territory railway into
the Eisteru States in order to bring whatever
population the line will create to those parts
of the country where there is most population
already. An amazingly cheeky person in the
pursuit of purely local interests is Alex. Wilson.
The original proposal was that the Commonwealth
should acquire the Territory, build a railway right
through it to develop the new asset, and connect
with the very nearest port in the south (Port
Augusta in S.A., on the road to Adelaide and
Melbourne), the Commonwealth to own the line
through S.A. and to possess its own sea-outlet at
Port Augusta. That is to say, it was to be a real
transcontinental line, over the shortest route,
developing new country, and it was to be Federal
property from sea to sea, with a Federal port at
each end. Against this Alex. Wilson proposes :
(1) That the transcontinental line shall take the shortest
possible cut out of the Territory, and leave it as far as
possible undeveloped.
(2) That it shall connect with Townsville, Rockhamp-
ton and Brisbane, and end at Sydney, and that Western
N.S.W. shall be further opened up by a Federal railway
to the fading town of Broken Hill, and another from
Broken Hill to the Murray.
(3) And this means that the Commonwealth is to take
over the Northern Territory and then build according to
Alex. Wilson’s own figures:—
Miles of
Railway.
In the Territory (to improve the common
property of Australia) 660
In Queensland (to improve purely State pro-
perty) 1313
In N.S.W. (to improve purely State property).. 4SO
In S.A., Victoria, Westralia and (of course)
Tasmania .. .. .. .. .. .. None
2453
One finds it difficult to remember when anything
more stupendous in the way of effrontery has been
suggested. If the line is built right through the
Territory, that means that the six States are all
contributing to the development of their joint pro-
perty for their mutual profit. The brilliant idea
of Alex. Wilson seems to be that S. A., Victoria.
Tasmania and Westralia shall pity their share of
the cost of the Territory, and also pay
their share of the cost of building 1793
miles of purely State railway in Queensland and
N.S.W. In other words, it is suggested that
these States should contribute towards the build-
ing of 2153 miles of railway, and the land values
created along nearly three-fourths of this length
are to go exclusively to Queensland and N.S.W. ;
which States will also share in the land
values created by the 6(>o miles of line built in
the Federal property of the Territory. It is
a lamentable evidence of how strong the parochial
and anti-Federal spirit is in the land, and how
constant is the tendency to view every national
undertaking merely as something to be diverted
into a scheme whereby “ our ” State may rook the
other States, that any apparently decent citizen
should be willing to stand behind such a proposi-
tion.
“A Captain of Industry.”
A little while ago Melbourne Argus braved the
weather and went out to Werribee. Although
these plains are within a few miles of Melbourne,
they are nearly all owned by squatters—chiefly
Austins and Ohirnsides —-and parts of them are
almost as lonesome and solitary as the country at
the back of Bourke. In its peregrinations, the
Argus came across the Avalon estate, owned by
Frank Austin, and up went its brolly in
admiration :
Four years ago the Avalon estate was a lonely sheep
run of 23,000 acres, giving employment to less than half a
dozen permanent hands, and about 30 men at shearing
time. It has been transformed into a great hive of indus-
try by the enterprise of its owner. In the place of the
two or three homes the station provided four years ago,
there are now between 30 and 40.
The more it saw of the estate, the greater grew
the doddery old paper’s admiration, until at last
it threw up its hat in this fashion :
The enviable title of “captain of industry” can be
fittingly given to Mr. Frank Austin, the owner of
Avalon. He has played off his own bat this magnificent
experiment in co-operative enterprise, which will stand
the test of criticism as a splendid undertaking.
And then the overjoyed old lady reverently writes
a biography, not only of the wonderful Frank
Austin himself, but of his predecessors as well.
Yet Frank Austin’s share in the “co-operative
enterprise ” is ludicrously small. He didn’t
make the land ; he didn’t even work and save to
buy it. He merely happened to be the son of the
man who squatted on it. All he did subsequently
was to realise .that it paid better to let farmers
use the land for grain-growing than to use it him-
self for sheep-raising. Perhaps he was too tired
even to raise sheep. Eighteen thousand acres
have been leased to farmers at an average of 12s.
(Id. per acre, giving Frank Austin a return of
£11,250 per annum, which he can collect in his
sleep. The gross return as a sheep-station is put
by the Argus at no more than £BOOO to £lO,OOO,
and then Frank Austin was running the place
himself and had the sheep on his mind. So this
captain of industry is getting a much larger
income and has less work and worry, and
has still 5000 acres of the estate left to
himself. The Argus article is over a column
long; but from start to finish there isn’t a word
to suggest that Frank Austin does a bit of farm-
ing or. other labor.. He just stands by in a
dignified attitude while the tenant farmers
toil; then he steps up—probably by bis
agent, he being too tired to step him-
self—and collects heavy toll from them for
allowing them to toil. It would be bad enough if
it were done quietly ; but when the lordly land-
owner is dragged into the limelight, and pointed
out as a “captain of industry,” and referred to as
a man whose “enterprise” has created “a hive
of industry,” it is about time to throw a brick, not
at Frank Austin —who at least has done better
than the dog in-.the-manger landlord —but at the
foolish old paper which is acting as his showman,
and is prepared, apparently, todo anything or say
anything so long as the big landlord is left in
possession.

“ Ring-Barked” : The policy of N.S. W. in regard
to Closer Settlement was shown up in the Assembly
debate over the resumption of the Mungery
estate, out in the Wilderness, near Peak Hill.
Why the Closer Clamberer should be asked to go
beyond Peak Hill while the squatter holds
vast areas readily getatable is a side issue.
Mongery is 55,000 acres big, and the Closer
Settling Board valued it at £1 15s. an acre. The
owner asked for a modest £3, but finally closed at
£2 2s. Minister Moore asked the House to jump
the 25., on the ground that a paltry florin didn’t
matter, though really the jump was 7s. The
House agreed, mainly because it was shown that
if the Appeal Court was asked to decide, the Costs
would be more than the few thousands in dispute.
During the debate it was elicited : —•
(1) The resumption would be cut up into 1500 acre
blocks.
(2) The State would have to raise £115,857 in order to
put some three dozen settlers on the land.
(3) Each of the three dozen would have to spend £3075
on land alone.
(4) To make the land available the Government must
build a costly railway line, and, when it is finished, the
distance from a market will be so great that the land is
only expected to improve in value by 3s. an acre.
(5) Nobody is very sanguine about the railway as a
payable spec.
(0) The State lias 40,000 acres of unoccupied land lying
right up alongside Mungery ; hut it hasn’t thought it
worth while to put this on the market.
(7) Anyhow, it wasn’t worth while making a fuss, for
the Government was already committed to the Mungery
purchase.
Thus does closer settlement start at Peak Hill, in
the county of Narromine, out close to Dandaloo,
272 miles from Sydney, on the road to the great
drought.
Victorian Lands Minister McKenzie has been
assured by a deputation from the Rodney irri-
gation district that it is quite impossible to live
on 200 acres. Whenever a deputation fires off a
yarn like this, the Minister ought to ask the land-
grabbers, one by one, bow much land they had
for a start. Mostly they will answer that they
began on, say, a couple of hundred acres, but it
was really impossible to live on that, so they
bought out the man next door, and after that
probably the man on the other side also. Just at
this point, the Minister ought to make it a rule to
ask where they got the money from. In nine
casesoutof ten, thegrabberwhosaysamanean’tlive
on (say) 200 acres not only did live on that, but
saved enough to buy out his neighbor—or, any-
way, to pay a tidy deposit on the bargain. There
are some men who couldn’t make a living from
10,000 acres; but mostly the accumulation of
small farms into a big one means, not that a man
can’t live on the small one, but that he can both
live on it and have enough over to start him on
a frantic career as a land-grabber.
—i——
A little Bill introduced to the Victorian Assem-
bly by lawyer Mackey threatens to do some much-
needed justice to the lodger. It provides that if
the landlord shall 1 have distrained on his tenant’s
goods and chattels, and in doing so shall have
seized anything belonging to a lodger, boarder, or
other sub-tenant, the latter may regain his pro-
perty on making a declaration that it belongs to
him solely, and on paying up any money due by
him to the tenant. Heaven only knows what
special virtues reside in the average landlord that
he should ever have been given the preposterous
power of grabbing a lodger’s belongings, or why,
even should Mackey’s Bill pass, the luckless
lodger should have to go to a lot of bother to
recover his boiled shirt and his extra pair of pants
from a man to whom he owes nothing, and whom
he has probably never seen ; but so it is.

When Alfred Deakin fused with Cook and
Fuller and the rest he finally abandoned all
thoughts of a Federal graduated land-tax, to break
up great estates and settle people on the land.
It was necessary to do so, for the Cook-Fuller-
Bruce Smith party constitutes a majority of the
fusion, and it is anti-land-tax almost to a man.
But Deakin compromised with his agile con-
science by promising that he, as Prime Minister of
Australia, would “call upon the States as they
had never been called on before” to unlock their
lands. This naturally excited some interest, and
a few days ago Senator Givens, of Queensland,
being anxious to know how the call was getting
on, asked a question about the progress of land
settlement in Victoria. This was the answer :
This Government has no official knowledge as to what
the policy of the Government of Victoria is, and even if
it had it would not feel justified in expressing- any criti-
cism upon a matter within the jurisdiction of the State.
Which suggests (1) that Deakin hasn’t been calling
loud enough for his colleagues to hear; (2) that
his own Government doesn’t even know that he is
going to call; (3) that it doesn’t know there is any
need to call; (4) that if it finds Deakin calling in
will regard the proceeding as an impertinence.
Many people suspect that Alfred Deakin
is not the monarch of the present Australian
Government, and William Lvne testifies to the
lowly position of the Affable One. Said William
at a recent function at Outtrim (Vic.) :
Wliat power has Mr. Deakin now? None. There is a
m ijorit.v against him in the Cabinet. Mr. Deakin did not
believe in sending Colonel Foxton home, hut he had to ;
and they will make him do other thing's he doesn’t believe
in.
From which it would appear that Alfred has still
a say in the Cabinet, though it is a say that might
as well be left unsaid.

The Bland Holt co. played “The Bond-
man,” a stage version by Hali Caine of his novel
of that name, at Sydney Royal for the first time on
Saturday night. It is a play of emotionalism
naked and unrestrained. Jason, the central
figure —a human ruin, whose mighty potentialities
for good have been frustrated—suggests the chief
character in “The Only Way.” He further re-
sembles Sidney Carton in that he offers up his
life to save his rival in love. Without claiming
to have met one of these admirable persons in the
uneventful routine of his daily toil, the writer
inclines to visualise them as quiet retir-
ing folk. But there is nothing unobtrusive
about Hall Caine’s self-martyr. He luxuriates
after the most blatant fashion in his misery.
Jason’s vociferousness on the subject of his
agonies may be effective melodrama, but it is in-
famously bad art. Utterly weak, too, is the
device by which Michael is made to quarrel with
his stainless wife. There is not sufficient evidence
against her to annoy.a Henry VIII., much less one
of Michael’s meek and trusting temperament.
As against these defects, the final denouement of
the drama is thrilling and more or less conceiv-
able, and it is approached in a series of delightful
stage-pictures.
* * * *
Jason, illegitimate half-brother of Michael,
deserts from a Sicilian merchantman, and refuges
in Fairbrother Farm, Lsleof Man. Here he finds
work and Greeba, who is engaged to Michael.
Michael lias, meanwhile, journeyed toSicily. Jason
falls in love with Greeba, and she—not having
heard from Mike for an unconscionable time—agrees
to marry him. Simultaneously arrives a batch of
correspondence from Michael, intimating that he
is President of the Sicilian republic, and as de-
voted to Greeba as evDr. And so Jason is turned
down. Hate surges in his embittered heart;
also the remembrance of a vow made some
years back to his mother in Heaven that
he would kill (1) his father, (2) his half-brother,
and so cheer things up for deceased in her
eternal home on the Golden Shore. The entire
company proceeds to Sicily in quest of Michael.
It discovers him in the sombre, yet alluring,
fancydressof his kind; and he holdshisjobjust long
enough, thereafter, to repudiate his wife, provide
an inebriated and unfrocked priest with a benefice,
and consign Jason to the local sulphur mines.
Then the troops of his political opponents enter
the Presidency, and conduct him to the identical
industrial concern wherein he has a few minutes
previously given Jason employment. The usual
infamies that characterise stage enterprises of this
sort occur. Even as minions are engaged dragging
about the whipping apparatus, chains and the like,
Stromboli erupts, and the miners' and their
torturers flee horrified. Jason undergoes a change
of heart and saves Michael. Things end as
happily as may be on the drinkless Island where
the once alcoholic but now severely teetotal cleric
aforementioned rules the roost.
* * * *
Arthur Styan’s vigorous acting is a feature
of the show. Bland Holt presents an ancient
grandfather replete with homely wit. The oldster
has nothing whatever to do with the action of the
piece, but he is there or thereabouts most of the
time, and gives the female sex many a good hard
verbal knock, to the infinite joy of the house.
Miss Harries Ireland is duly pathetic as Greeba ;
Max Maxwell limns a beautiful, fatuous young
President of a type that was never seen on sea or
land, but is frequent enough on boards ; and God-
frey Cass’s Father Ferrati —the divine who rises
to higher things on stepping stones of dead
marines—is worth going far to see.
A fire broke out at Her Majesty’s (Sydney),
last Sunday (which is this theatre’s favorite day
for getting burnt), and some thousands of pounds’
worth of damage was done to the auditorium. It
will be a fortnight or three weeks before the in-
juries caused by the combustible element and the
water that was poured thereon can be set right;
and meanwhile “The Flag Lieutenant ” co. will
“ rest.”

Comment on the performers at Sydney
Criterion had to be held over last week for reasons
of space. Theydidn’t really deserve to be held over,
of course. Miss Lincoln, with her sweet voice,
finished singing method and gentle appealing
personality, makes an ideal Cinderella. Miss
Meredith Meredro, who plays Prince Casimir,
presents a most vigorous and sparkling royalty.
She is a tall generous vision of alluring curves and
gleaming teeth and eyes, added to which she owns
a pleasant light soprano voice. The rciles of
Araininta and Elvira, step sisters of Cinderella,
are in the hands of Miss Daisy Belmore and Miss
Emmeline Orford respectively. They are a
comely pair, but their natures are obviously un-
warped by jealousy •or base passion of any
kind, wherefore the bursts of scorn they
direct at tljeir humble relative are out of
place. Miss Essie Perrin represents a “Fairy
dancer.” The lady is palpably mundane, bear-
ing no resemblance to any known breed of
fairy, but she is delightful all the same, and there
should be more of her and her charming dance.
Harold Thorley has an all too small part as Dan-
dini. His one song —a poor one—suffices to show
that his fine baritone voice has,lost none of its
quality. The broad comedy is supplied by William
Cromwell (the Baron), Edwin Brett (the Baron-
ess), and Tom Payne (Capers). They are all
diverting according to their different styles ; but,
as above stated, the show would be none the
worse if their exuberance were curbed somewhat.
Ihe long run is the father and mother of the
superfluous “gag.” And there are few stage
spectacles more depressing than that of an out-
size crop of unnecessary quips rioting, unmown,
behind the footlights.

Ifc is cheerful to record that the populace
is crowding to the Newbury concerts in’ Sydney
Y.M.C.A. Hall. Last Saturday night, when the
Harbor was a symphony in moon silver and black
velvet shadows, quite a lot of people on the
theatre boats were bound for the Newbury show,
the tenor himself, on that coldlv-beautiful eveu-
ing, first sang “On With the Motley,” from “I
Pagliacci,” and, an encore threatening to demolish
the edifice, “Songs My Mother Taught Me” was
wafted forth to calm the raging sea of enthusiasm.
Baritone Charles Larsen, Elsie Fischer and Ruby
Michael were the other singers of the evening.
Recitations by Lewis Scott and instrumental
solos by Gladstone Bell (’cello), Cyril Monk and
Lionel Lawson (violin), and Lauranee Phillip
(piano) helped to balance the programme. On
Saturday, August 7, it is.annouriced, most of the
artists mentioned will appear; also Amy Murphy
will uplift her well-trained soprano.

For once, the Pathe Freres film at Sydney
Palace is not the best that shimmers across the
flickering screen. In the matter of genuine
human interest, the Yankee film of “ The Note in
the Shoe,”, eclipses it easily. It is a great
gaunt Yankee factory, and the girls in the packing
department are sorting out the boots from little
trucks, and packing them into boxes. Into the
heart of one comes a sudden longing for romance.
Her eyes light with the inspiration of mis-
chief; she speaks to the other girl at the bench,
and into the shoe she slips a note to the effect
that the packer desires to make the acquaintance
of a kind gentleman with a view to matrimony.
Unfortunately her little ad. falls on stony ground in
the shape of a pompous bear who, having bought
some footgear, is disgusted to have his toe irri-
tated by the tiling. He hauls it forth, carts the
whole collection—footgear, box, note and all—
to the shop, and by demanding his money back
rouses the ire of the shop manager. (All this
is a cute Yankee ad.) The retailer complains. The
girl is hauled before the manager, a youthful
swain and susceptible withal. For the girl hath
many beauties. She is reinstated. She does it
again, and once more is hauled before the man-
ager, this time to be dismissed. She goes home
to mother, where fierce scolding is followed by a
rain of tears. A knock comes to the door, and the
young manager walks in. The two live happily
ever afterwards.

An evening at Spencer’s Theatrescope,
Sydney, might well be entitled “A Tour of the
Romantic and Beautiful.” The wild magni-
ficence of the mountains of British Columbia
makes one long for the days when the 30C0-ton
aeroplane will glide peacefully between those
peaks of snow. Then, in a twinkling, the
scene is changed to the hills of Bosnia—those
hills crammed full of fearsome tales of. battles
between Turkish hordes and Christian hosts; and
then away to the Norwegian fiords, whence our
rude forefathers issued forth to make hay while
the sun shone from the Skager Rack to far Con-
stantinople. There is a wealth of Old World
feeling about those big cliffs, tremendous ravines
and always peaceful waters glinting sleepily,
eerily in the arctic calm.

Sydney Tivoli is farewelling vigorously
at time of writing. Chung Ling Soo will shake
hands with himself on Thursday evening for the
last time ; so the Sydney man who has not seen
him will have to proceed in haste to the Tiv. or
for ever hold his cash. The Three Laurels, the
humorous hand-balancers, depart one night later,
and Cissie Curlette having already gone, that will
leave R. H. Douglass and the rank-and-file to
furnish the stage. The size, shape and entertain-
ing capacity of the expected reinforcements are
not at this moment known ; but the footlights
threaten to be somewhat dimmer at the end of
the week. The silent Chung is a very large
comet indeed, and a certain amount of darkness
must be expected when he flashes out of sight.

Adelaide is quite sorry to lose Maggie

Castlereagh House, the magnificent new struc-
ture at the- corner of Castlereagh and Hunter streets.
Sydney, is evidently being erected by some people of
patriotic common-sense. The place is to be fitted with
24 strong rooms, and the doors and fittings for these are
not being imported, as has been the case in the past.
They are being manufactured to order by that well-known
and reliable Australian firm, Wearne and Breakspear, who
have for years been making safes that have held their
own easily enough, and very often beaten the best im-
ported. A Wearne and Breakspear safe or strong-room
door is fireproof, and, being correctly made, does not
transmit the heat, as many of the imported articles do.
After all, patriotism is The struggling
Australian cannot afford to do bad work—he has his repu-
tation to make ; and, moreover, being on the spot, he can
be got at if his goods are not up to sample.*
“It’s Never Too Late To Mend,” the
simple, melodramatic story of that rugged and
ready old writer, Charles Reade, was revived at
Melbourne King’s on Saturday for the edification
of latter-day sinners. Melodrama plots were
plain and consecutive when Reade aimed his
brick at the “ model”-prison system, and the
characters in this elderly narrative walk on and
explain themselves in uncompromising terms.
Also Anderson assists the understanding of his
patrons by stating the facts of the case on the
programme. John Meadows (Edmund Duggan)
comes to light as “ a man of iron will.” Temple
Harrison is billed as a person “in the pay of
Meadows,” which is superfluously instructive,
seeing that he tells all about himself in a loud,
confidential whisper to the audience, as soon as
he appears. The Jew of the rural district where
the trouble begins is a sad, sententious Shy-
lock, who curses the man of iron will in
prophetic tones, so that the eventual overthrow
of that inflexible schemer is a foregone conclu-
sion. Moreover, the “colonial” developments of
the plot are hinted at in the first place. The
brothers Fielding can’t make a living on their
English farm, and George the elder, being en-
gaged to the daughter of a less unsuccessful agri-
culturist, has nochance of getting the old man’s con-
sent to marry Susan until he can put £lOOO into the
land. But George, the rival lover to the metallic-
willed person, is not the hero. Tom Robinson, a
jaunty, flash citizen from London, has that
job. Thomas is a frank and open thief, with an
honest affection for his innocent friend George.
He seems open to “ nick ” anything save George’s
fine old silver teapot and Susan’s solid bits of
jewellery. Tom has disrespectful ideas about his
native England, which he regards as a comfortable
country to be a dook in, but a mighty cold place
for a struggling farmer.
A policeman arrives from London and
captures the genial Mr. Robinson for stealing
banknotes. At the same time he secures a local
criminal—a small boy who had shaken two pota-
toes from the crop of the iron-willed capitalist to
feed a starving mother. The second act shows T.
Robinson and the boy suffering the horrors of the
model-prison system. Tom is a heroic rebel,
given to the pastime of defying the governor of
the gaol what time the boy is being done to death
bv the law. Fortunately the prison chaplain
(Harry Diver) is the real boss of the pro-
ceedings. Under his prayerful management, the
governor gets discharged, and Tom Robinson, the
serio-comic convict, gets a free pardon to go to
Australia, after promising his pious benefactor
that he will mend and remain mended for the
term of his natural life. George Fielding has
already gone to Australia to earn the price of
Susan. Robinson, therefore, finds his friend, after
a tramp of 160 miles, and raises him from a bed of
sickness to look for gold. They find a nugget
weighing 1001 b. or so, and having vanquished
some bad early colonists, who are also looking for
nuggets, they return to England and save
Susan from marrying the wrong man. As a matter
of fact, they didn’t really discover the nugget.
They were put on to it by Jacky-Jackv, an
aboriginal who introduces a panto, element into
their Australian career.
The late Charles Warner of yore was
identified with “It’s Never Too Late to Mend,”
and the present revival seems to be the first since
Warner was at Melbourne Royal 20 years ago.
The drama carries its age very well. It has lost
none of its original fulness of moral tone, and, in
its aspect of an early advt. for Australia, it is in-
teresting. Roy Redgrave revels in the lighter
phases of the leading character. He is as hoarse
as the proverbial raven nowadays, but hoarseness
seems natural to humorous criminality and a re-
pentant spirit. In the presence of the dead boy
who stole the’taters, and in other places where
emotional force has unlimited opportunity to
harrow the surface of the public soul, Redgrave is
not a Warner, but his comedy is capital. Diver
snaps out the precepts and protests of the chaplain
with telling effect. Bert Bailey, clad in a suit of
sable tights, is a cheerful Jacky-Jacky, though
his panto, scenes need pruning; and Dunbar.
Duggan, Miss Gair, Miss Erris (as the ’tater
burglar), and sundry other members of the co. are
more or less successful. Temple Harrison is
among the less successful ones, because he
represents an English village attorney of unsober
character as a cross between Lawyer Marks and
Deacon Skinner.
This is the second week of “ Havana” at
Her Majesty’s (Melbourne), and Bert Gilbert is
brandishing his meat axe at a moderate!}' admir-
ing world. “Havana” is amusing for the most
part and riotously funny in spots. The merry
widow in collusion with her gay deceased is a
memorable spot, and Laughter holds both his
sides when the gay deceased, raving under the
impression that Susie Vaughan is his lawful wife
and resenting the fact that she has raffled herself
among the conspirators, wants to chop off her
head with the axe afore-mentioned.

At Melbourne Princess’s a revolutionary
change of bill is to happen next Saturday. In
place of “ A Bachelor’s Honeymoon,” which is
farce from foundation to roof, Hugh Ward is
going to stage “ The Fencing Master,” described
as a comedy-drama of power and passion, likewise
pleasantry. For this new production Mrs.
Brough is to join the co.. and one Wernham
Ryott will make his.first appearance in Melbourne.

At the Royal a celebrated Shrew is being
tamed on the old Paduan system every night
until further notice. Melbourne has decided that
Oscar Ashe’s beautiful show is something to be
seen and talked about. People who formerly
swore by Marie Corelli have gone so far as to call
Shakspeare their favorite author, and some popu-
lar misquotations from their divine protegi are in
daily use among the best-dressed people. Anumber
of girls are positively devouring Shakspeare, they
say. Also, they are wondering how much Miss
Bray ton’s dresses cost a yard. Probably the most
popular feature of this smart picturesque perform-
ance is the cloth of gold gown in which Katharine
“goes away” after her wedding. She didn’t
intend to go away in it, but Petruchio takes her
up like a parcel, and bears her off to his ancestral
kitchen without consulting the lady. This is
where the small fragile husband of a tall massive
Birdie feels that Shakspeare is taking a rise out
of him, so to speak.

The departure of Cinquevalli and the
introduction of a new first part are the latest
occurrences at Melbourne Opera House. The
new first part is in kilts, and the Scottish Meisters
are its leading Macgregors. But it isn’t all Scotch.

sented in turns, and when two young ladies sing
of shedding their blood for Ingland and point
Union Jacks at the black-faced corner-men the
future of the Empire seems assured.
O, have you seen the Flappers who are flapping in
“Havana” ?
They are damsels eight in number, and they’ve
nothing else to do
Than burst on the proceedings in a most surprising
mannah
And save the situation when it threatens to fall
through.
If there comes a sudden silence to a languid con-
versation,
And you fancy that the story must have met
with a mishap,
The orchestra starts playing with re-doubled
animation,
And the Flappers get the office, and they come
along and flap.
When the patriots of Cuba have desisted from
their plotting
And the sentimental lady isn't singing to her
beau,
When the native girls and yachtsmen are pre-
sumably a-yachting
And the bo’sun and Anita are not shaking up
the show —
Well, something’s got to happen (and it doesn’t
really matter,
The audience is reckless, and it doesn’t care a
mi ™p);
Ihen, bounding on in couples, with a consequential
clatter,
The Flappers take the centre and gratuitously
flap.
They are pretty near related to the chorus and
the ballet,
For they sing and dance and posture in an old
/ familiar way ;
Yet their one and only duty is, at intervals, to
rally
To the succor of a johnny who i‘S trving to be

He is gentle, kind and sober, and, he warbles not
too badly ;
One might truthfully describe him as a decent
sort of chap,

Why the Flappers were invented to support
him with a flap. »

AT POVERTY POINT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
George Reid’s supporters entertained him at a smoke
social at Darlinghurst (N.S.W.) the other nig’ht—that is
to say, the supporters met and G. Reid was expected to
entertain them. But even his committee realises that at
64 he isn’t what he was ; and so Chung Ling Soo was
brought in to help along the show. But yesterday the
bill said—
George H. Reid.
To-day it says—
G. Rkid and Chung Ling Soo.
To-morrow it will De—
Chung Ling Soo
and a host of other talent.
It may be dreadful to think that to-morrow he will be
numbered with Irving Sayles ; but —did any one mention
the High Commissionership?
The Musical and Dramatic Benevolent Fund of Victoria
recently issued its annual statement of receipts and
expenditure, from which it appears that two shows by-
amateur companies in Melbourne were worth £3OO to the
fund. The Savage Club performance of “Society”
realised £2Ol, and the amateurs who tackled “ The
Liars ” a while ago yielded £9B for their trouble ; whereas
the annual benefit given by the ancient pros, brought no
more than £lO8 —a smaller amount than usual. The
M. and D. B. Fund is a very practical charity ; £233 was
last year debited to “maintenance account, permanent
recipients and casual relief.” The funeral of an old actor
accounted for a trifle of expenditure. The working exes,
were but £27 6s. all told, and the fund finished its
financial year with £179 in the Savings Bank.
A. W. : It is a gem out of the mine of misinformation to
say that it is some 20 .years since the “ Merchant of
Venice” and “Othello” were presented in Melbourne, as
one of your correspondents does. It is easilv inside
the last 10 years that both have been played ; the one
by Kyrle Bellew and Mrs. Brown-Potter, and the other
by Wilson Barrett and the limelight man.
Some points from Bernard Shaw’s manifesto on the
banning of his play, “Blanco Posnet,” by the censor in
Britain:—“l do not know why the play has been
declared unfit to exist. It is a eery simple and even
crud.' melodrama, withabsolutely nosexual interest what-
ever. It represents a little community of violent, cruel,
sensual, ignorant, blasphemous, bloodthirsty backwoods-
men, whose conception of manliness is mere brute
pugnacity, and whose favorite sport is lynching-.
Into this welter of crude newspaperised savagery there
suddenly comes a force —not mentioned in ‘The Merry
widow ’ —to which they give the name of God, the
slightest regard for which they make it a point of
honor to despise as mere weakness of character. That
force, nevertheless, at the crisis which is the subject of
the drama, makes them do its will and not their own in a
manner very amazing to themselves, and, I should hope,
not altogether unedifying 10 the spectators. lam givtn
to understand that the introduction of this force
into my play as a substitute for the simple cupidi-
ties and concupiscences of ‘ The Merry Widow ’ is the
feature that renders the play unfit for perform-
ance. It was precisely the feature which made the
Play worth writing to me. What is called the struggle
of a man with God is the most dramatic of all conflicts ;
in fact, the only one that makes really good drama. . . .
And that, I understand, is why the King will not allow
my hero to be exhibited on the stage in England. He
could have been seduced by ‘The Me ry Widow’ with
impunity. So England will have its ‘Merry Widow,’ and
the other countries will have their ‘ Blanco Posnet.’ It is
not for me to say which will have the best of that bargain
in the long run. ’’
“ E.D.”: Rash, injudicious Melbournians, mostly mem-
bers of the Shakspearian Society, seize the opportunity
of the bard’s revival, whereof Asehe is the Alexander
Chapman, to roar for a statue of Will Shakspeare. They
represent in impassioned Argus letters that Melbourne
is ignominious because of its lack of a Shakspearian statue,
and declare that almost every other city of any conse-
quence in the Empire has a stone effigy of Bill. The
absence of Bill, done in solid rock or tinkling bronze, is
alleged to bean injustice to the author of “ Hamlet,” and
a grave reflection on Melbourne’s tremendous literary
pretensions. This lot of noise seems very absurd to me.
Really rare Will Shakspeare doesn’t need a memorial,
and the building of a stone, brick or metal Dagon in his
honor strikes me as the same kind of giddy folly as put-
ting up a three-by-ten obelisk to the Matterhorn, or
erecting a cairn as big as a two-roomed hen-house to com-
memorate Popocatepetl or the Himalayas. The only ex-
cuse fora statue of YV. Shakspeare anywhere is the assur-
ance that it will be an absolute work of art and a tiling of
beauty in itself ; and, looking about on the images of
Melbourne, I haven't much hope that it would be that
sort. Melbourne at present is only in the Fitzgibbon-
stage of statuary art.
“O. K.” : Oscar Asche’s production of “ The Taming of
the Shrew” is another interesting reminder that many
generations of intellectual stage craftsmen have labored
in the scenic furnishings and interpretations of Shak-
speare’s bare plays, each generation retaining some
things w'hilst discarding others, and putting new and
additional effects into the scheme. In the various “ read-
ings ” of familiar characters about which there has been
much wise and silly discussion during the centuries since
Shakspeare’s time, the advance has probably been incon-
siderable. Actors were as keen critics of human nature
300 vea s ago as to-day, and many strivings after origin-
ality in the “conception” of a part have failed to
establish any lasting precedents. An exceptionally suit-
able actor gives a strikingly convincing performance of a
character as long as he remains suitable. His next suc-
cessor in importance may have a more subtle intelligence
but a less fitting personality. The histrionic art is
mainly imitative, and it is physically impossible for
each clever actor in turn to reproduce all the best

acting he has seen and add new ideas to it. Bufc
in the “ production ” of these old plays there
is room for steady improvement. Thoughts are
piled upon thoughts. Garrick may have been a
rarely gifted actor, but as a producer of “Katharine
and Petruchio ” he was a raw novice compared with Oscar
Asehe, the producer of “ Taming of the Shrew,” who has
far greater resources of information and stage effects to
draw upon. Each successive combination of stage-
manager, scenic artist and archseological-expert adviser
adds something to the fund of knowledge of how to
present a Shakspearian play picturesquely. And the
mechanical scientists are for ever making it easier for the
producers to approach perfection. In the important
detail of lighting, modern managers have an im-
mense advantage over the best representatives of the
“ good old school ” who had only gas to work with. The
manufacture of scenic fittings is more ingenious than it
was only a few years ago. Embellishments that Shak-
speare never dreamed of were introduced into the per-
formance of his plays before our old friend Queen Anne
was dead, and ever since that, sad event the brightest
intellects of the theatrical world have done their best to
keep the immortality of Divine William in a good state of
repair. He was worth all the trouble, but he has been
the luckiest of dramatic authors in getting it.
The Bulletin receives an indignant letter :
“ Dear Bulletin, — I am no critic, but when I read your
criticism of the ‘Flag Lieut.’ I was ashamed to admit
that I have read The Bulletin for the past 14 years.
Take, for instance, the scene where ‘Bill’ conceives the
notion of disguising himself. He dons the disguise
all right ; but seems to overlook the fact that his skin is
absolutely ivhite. Again, he knows well that the country
surrounding the fort is teeming with snipers; yet he
chooses broad daylight and the most dangerous side of
the fort to set out on his enterprise. The actors, with
the exception of a very few, are the poorest I’ve seen for
some time.— Curly.”
Which about takes the cake for ignorant criticism. Bill
doesn’t paint himself black because a nigger would be too
conspicuous in a white man’s country. And as his dis-
guise is good, and he can talk Greek, he naturally
goes in broad daylight. He wants the snipers to
seeplainlv that he is one of their own crowd, so that
they won’t shoot. At night he would be only a gliding
shadow, and a sniper, not being able to see his clothes
clearly enough to be taken in by the disguise, would
probably plug him at random. Bill has an objection to
being plugged at random or any other way, hence his
proceedings.
Roberto Hazon, sometime conductor of the Sydney
Philharmonic and Amateur Orchestral Societies, and
general musical panjandrum, has been interviewed by
some travelling Australians in his Italian retirement.
Hazon made hardly any disguise of the fact that he would
gladly come back. When he was in Sydney he saw the
macaroni and the organ-grinder’s monkey of his native
land through a pleasant haze of youthful recollections,
and his great ambition was to spend his declining years
amid the old scenes. Then he returned to find that the
glamor had departed, and that the monkev had fleas on
him, and that the old Italy was half-dream and half-
delusion, and all disappointment.
“ Harrison O.”: “0.K.” (B. 24/6/’O9) speaks of the dis-
respect shown by the younger generation to “ The Silver
King.” He states that one young actor recently informed
him that the “King’’was an old-fashioned melodrama
that should have been thrown upon the rubbish-
heap years ago. I cordially agree with all of “O.K’s.”
remarks concerning its construction, characterisation and
dialogue ; but my respect for the Jones-Hermann master-
piece is founded chiefly upon the fact that the whole play
is so inherently possible. Many parts of it are even prob-
able, wherein lies its radical difference from all other
melodramas. When we go to see “The Silver King" we
do not witness the weary spectacle of a cigarette-smoking
villain and a fur-cloaked adventuress persecuting an
absurd hero and his anaemic donah throughout the best
part of five acts. “The Silver King” villains—Elijah
Coombe, Cripps, Skinner and the rest—are all flesh and
blood characters; and their crimes are committed for
reasonable motives. They do not murder for the joy of
observing the blood, and of being able to blow tobacco
smoke into the face of the corpse. The killing of Geoffrey
Ware does not require any explanation, dramatically—it
was the only logical course for the “Spider ” to take if he
wished to avoid a substantial slab of penal servitude. His
remark, “ I have gone too far this time,” muttered as he
makes his escape from the murdered man’s room by way
of the window, is eminently realistic. Even the comic
relief is miles ahead of the average. It is not wedged in
between times, while the supers are changing the scenes
and the heroine her dresses; it transpires quite natur-
ally. Only once does “The Silver King” stumble into
the mire of impossibility, and that is at the end
of Act IV., at the wharf, when Deaf Dicky throws
off his disguise and stands revealed as Wilfred Denver.
Even this wild plunge into Blandolt madness can be ex-
cused, because the result is one of the finest possible
“ curtains.”
“ OneWhoPays The first performance of “ The Taming
of the Shrew ” was a delicious midwinter night’s dream.
From a rainy Bourke-street, sheeny with the electrics,
and bitten with the icy breath from Shackletonville, we
entered the romantic atmosphere of the playhouse. The
mighty master proved his supremacy as dramatist as well
as poet. Oscar Asche’s reception was the biggest gale that
ever I heard through the rigging of a show. An inde-
scribably beautiful actor. Such a rich, full-orbed voice,
in contrast to the familiar husky. Yet in this performance
he seldom rose above the cackle of conversation, with
every syllable audible in every cranny. I was astonished
with his lightness of touch and airiness. My impression
was that he would be heavy, like the Brooice tradition.
You can perceive bis magnificent range, from Othello,
Virginius or Richelieu to Hamlet, Benedick or Charles
Surface. How an actor like this uproots the Wilson
Barrett type 1 His English speaking is delightfully
pure and pellucid, without a London accent
or any other, and yet I fancy his utterly
natural acting was made in Gertnan3 r , where they
are such Shakspearian gluttons. Maybe he did not in-
vent all the intensely funny detail of Christopher Sly.
The scenery and costumes were all got up specially for
this Austr lian tour. “ The Taming of the Shrew ’’ran 700
nights in England. Asehe would not fetch his old props*
We bear in mind the excellent performances by Kolker
and Margaret Anglin. Kolker romped like a colt.
Asehe is more finished. Lily Brayton embodies
the Shrew better than Margaret, who lacked cayenne
in the earlier portions, being so full of the milk of
human kindness, yet I thought her a trifle better in the
final speech than Miss Brayton. Of course, all actresses
have their beauty spots. Asehe is going to enter upon a
great Australian managerial career, like Williamson with
“Struck Oil,” and Rignold with “ Henry V.” He will be
forced to study many new parts, and develop like a sun-
flower. Lily’s great characters are Rosalind and Viola.
“D. ” : I think there ought to be some sort of time
limit after which actors should be debarred from portray-
ing Hamlet. The Walter Bentley Hamlet who has just
faded from Sydney was palpably not a minute under 45.
There are some clothes that men in middle life cannot
wear with dignity ; some phrases that they may not
employ if they are to side-step the snigger of the ribald
galleryite. The clothes of Hamlet and many of his
speeches afford examples in point. The melancholy
one was meant by Shakspeare to be 30 years of
age. The First Clown fixes it. He dates his
eruption into the grave-digging profession from
“ the very day that young Hamlet was horn ”; and
he (the clown) has been at. the job, he intimates later,
“ man and boy 30 years.” Picture W. N. Willis, clad in a
low-necked velvet suiting of funereal black, declaiming
passionately of the conduct of his enemies. The idea is
absurd. Willis is too fat and elderly for the business.
The present-day Bentley is the living image of the pre-
sent-day Willis. It is useless to pretend that he carries
off the part of Hamlet convincingly. Were the regula-
tion I advocate in force he would have ceased from
troubling in this essentially youthful role a full decade
since.
Earnest admirers of the bright and shining Knight will
be interested to learn the probably untrue fact that
Julius Superbus frequently employs his leisure knitting.
He plies knitting-needles with great dexterity, and finds
the operation of composing a woollen binder or a set cf
socks very soothing to the nerves. How the reverent
admirers of Superbus will bear the thought of that
magnificent object sitting by the ingle in an old arm-
chair, manufacturing knitted mufflers while the cat purrs
on the hob, The Bulletin cannot say, but as Julius
probably doesn’t do it after all, the matter doesn’t signify
so much as it might do if he did do it.

INFANT TERRIBLE: “Oh, I was in bed when you

The Melbourne Tramway Co. is proceed-
ing, like its own arks, to oblivion; but old age
and the pangs of approaching liquidation have
not made it less of a public skinflint, or improved
its disposition as an employer of men. Its latest
exploit has been the sacking of six of its employees
without any explanation other than that they
were dissatisfied, and “the co. has no use for dis-
satisfied people.” One man of the half-dozen had
been in the service since 1888, and another since
1891; so, presumably, they had been disguising
their dissatisfaction for about 20 years, whilst
doing their work sufficiently well to be retained in
their jobs. To the tranquil, unbiassed looker-on,
this would seem to prove that they possessed in a
high degree the virtues of loyalty, industry and
self-control. Apparently, on an evil day, the
mournful fact which they had been con-
cealing for two decades came to light,
and they were fired for not being per-
fectly happy and contented, and neglecting to
bless the company and all its directors with suffi-
cient enthusiasm. The attitude of the Mel-
bourne Tram Monopoly towards the allegedly
dissatisfied employee is quite a different pose from
its attitude towards the genuinely dissatisfied
public. In the employee’s case, dissatisfaction is
something horrible that pollutes the atmosphere,
and cannot be tolerated for a week’s notice ; when
the dissatisfaction is supplied by the travelling
public, it is a perfectly harmless thing to which no
attention need be paid. If the awful co. was per-
fectly sincere in its statement that it has no use
for dissatisfied people, the doors and platforms of
its moving arks would be boarded in and the
relics would be trundling about empty.

Editor George Fenwick, of Otago (M.L.)
Daily Times, has been telling again the
alleged genesis of that venerable character, the
“old identity.” (The ancient must be distin-
guished from the “ Oldest Inhabitant” who lives
in a luxurious top-back room at 214 George-street
North, Sydney.) Dunedin (M.L.), about the
’so’s, was “ vera Scotch,” and proud of it ; so,
when the “ Victorian influx” happened, after the
Australian gold rushes began to peter out, Dune-
din said, “ Hoots mon ! ” or words to that effect,
and “Father” Henry Cargill advised the ostra-
cism of the plebeian newcomers. “Let us pre-
sairve oor auld identity,” said he. Among the
immigrants was Richmond Thatcher, rhymer and
caricaturist, later Sydney Punch humorist .and
publican, who uplifted the situation in rather
ramshackle song :
Mr. Cargill in the Council marie such a funny speech ;
He got up and he stated that it devolved on each
Of all the early dwellers to preserve safe as could be,
Amid the Victorian influx, the old identity.
Thus the “first settlers” of Dunedin became the
“ old identities ” thereof, and they retaliated by
calling the new-comers the “young iniquities.”
Since then 0.1. has wandered far from Dunedin,
and is to be found dead most days in the under-
takery columns of the pipers. Though often
dead, yet doth he live to die more often, and the
things that he remembers are manifold.
The law in Victoria is at present turning
its good eye on a little swindle that has all the
simplicity of genius. Briefly, some ill-regulated
persons recollected that the average shent per
shent usurer lends his good gold to public servants
with a facility he doesn’t extend to the ordinary
citizen ; so No. 1 dropped into Moses’ office and
desired a trifling loan of £2O on his bill, he being
William Mcßrien, porter. His friend Thomas
O'Grant, shunter, would buck the document.
Moses turned up the proper Gazette, found the
two names entered therein, and promptly com-
pleted the transaction. Then Messrs. O’Grant
and Mcßrien stepped across the street to Ephraim
i Abrahams’office and repeated the performance—
for a trifle of £lB this time. Also two other ser-
vants of the public happened along later and were
similarly accommodated with a trifle, after which
they enthusiastically called on other money-lenders.
They always varied the amount asked for. and they
don’t seem to have overdone the thing ; but natur-
ally the day came when Moses, Ephraim and Co.
wrote firmly to the real O’Grant. Mcßrien and
Co., and threatened legal proceedings if there
wasn’t an immediate settlement. Then several
very angry public servants called on the usurers
and asked them with great indignation what they
meant by it. The horrified money lenders rushed
to the detective office, and besought the force to
arrest everybody and get them back their good
monish. The detectives assured them the money
was gone, though it was possible the rascals might
be arrested. They did arrest four, who have
since been committed for trial ; but not a trace of
the precious money could either Moses or Ephraim
find about any of them.

“Newsboy” : What’s the matter with re-
naming certain of the streets of Melbourne and
suburbs on common-sense lines? At present,
wherever a road or street crosses the boundary-
line of the council in which it began, into the dis-
trict of another council, its name is promptly
changed. If it chances to pass through a dozen
or a hundred different councils’ districts, its name
is changed a corresponding number of times.
F rinstanoe, Swanston-street, after leaving the
city, is re-named St. Kilda-road ; arrived at the
St. Kilda boundary, it changes to High-street.
Later it becomes Brighton-road till it reaches
Elsternwick, when it is re-labelled Point Nepean-
road. In the same way Dandenong-road becomes
first Wellington-street and then Fitzrov-street
(after passing from Malvern to Prahran and St.
Kilda respectively). And so on. In the name
of reasonableness and the puzzled horning drunk,
I rise to inquire, “Whaffor?” and, if so, why
not rectify the evil ?
THE DISCRIMINATING ANIMAL.

No Sydney Wages Board has, so far, un-
earthed worse conditions than those that are
alleged to exist in the soft-drink business—the
business which is run mainly for the people who
are so horrified at the poverty to which sinful
Beer reduces other people. Apparently, the
smaller “factories” only exist because they are
allowed to grossly underpay their employees. In
these places, which have spasms of activity in
summer and slabs of stagnation in
winter, 30s. a week for carters or
bottlers is affluence. The Board has
listened to narratives of how “ general
hands” stagger away with a weekly
225. 6d., and eke out an existence
by boot-coblding, etc., in their
spare time. It lias
been told of the
slavery of carters,
who get a retainer
of a few shillings a
week and commis-
sion, and chase
round among the
little lolly shops for
80 hours a week
and more. These
men have no holi-
day in “the sea-
son ”; even the
Saturday half-holi-
day movement is a
long way from
reaching the man
who has to hawk
his stuff in what is
called a “catch
trade,” trying to get
his doctored rubbish
in ahead of the other fellow’s.
“Yarrurn”: Talking last
week to a Sydney tram-conductor
on holiday, he said : “Conductin’ isn’t
the game it was before the strike by long
chalks, although there’s just as much
money in it. We have to submit to all
sorts of indignities, and all on account of
these immigrant blokes, who are getting a
big footing amongst us. Talk about Boys of
the Bull-dog Breed! It ought to Vie Boys
of the Door-mat Breed ; because they’ll suffer
being trodden upon by low-down bosses and
the fat public, and come up smiling for more
tread every time. It means that we Australians
must get ourselves into line with the cringers, or
get out. No, not many of the Maorilanders have
got on, and they are all decent enough blokes ;
but the Boys of the Door-mat Breed—well, it
makes me just weak to think about ’em. Any
chance of a successful strike, with the crowd we
have now, is quite out of the question. We’d
have as much show of annexing Russia.”
Christchurch (M.L.), which had become
one of the most dangerous towns in the world for
pedestrians, has at last started out to deal with
the motor hog. Fortunately, when the motor
craze started, a local law was passed compelhng
every owner to register and pay a fee. Ihe
motorist is given a number, which he
must display at the rear of his car in 2fpn.
white letters on a dark ground. At night
the tail light must be so placed that it
illuminates the number. This sys-
tem makes identification simple and
certain. But it has not prevented
the motor hog from raging
furiously. Motor cars and motor
bikes are as numerous as the
sands on the seashore, and
anxiety hangeth like a cloud
over the humble pedestrian.
The medical profesh uses motors
to a man, and constitutes a large
portion of the hog. Medicoes
travel at all speeds from 30 to
65 miles an hour, and they dash
round corners and across side
streets with the suddenness of
an avenging demon. But now
plain clothes detectives have
arranged “traps” in various
parts of the city, and the motor-
ist’s number is snatched as he
flees over the measured distances
on his way to destruction. If
he has exceeded the speed limit
over the measured stretch of
tempting road he is earnestly in-
vited to explain matters to a
gentleman who sits under a
coat of arms, and has a habit of
saying “ forty shillings or seven
days ” even in his sleep.
Taifc, of the Victorian Rail-
ways, hasn’t yet announced that
he is going to strike out the name
of Melbourne from his time-tables,
etc., and call the place Westminster,
or Manchester, or Quebec; but no-
body need be very much surprised if
something of the sort happens. Since
he arrived the names of no less than 111 stations
have been altered, many of them for the worse.
Wherein, for example, lies the virtue of replacing
Monbulk by Belgrave, Laancoorie bv Shelburne,
Minapre by Lascelles, Whroo Road by Ham-
mond, Koo-wee-rup by Dalmore. or Kosstown by
Carnegie? And why should he have altered
Spencer’s Crossing to Levy ? Who is Levy, any-
how? And why hasn’t Sunshine been re-christ-
ened Golgotha?

A quaint anomaly has sprung up in and
around Sydney, and it wants straightening out.
Recently the law came down with a thud on sub-
urban butchers’ shops, and ordered the owners
and occupiers to fence them in from the streets
with glass or fly-proof netting ; but though there
is more dirt and filth and floating death in the
city than in the average suburb, the city but-
cheries are still allowed to be open to the street,
so that the dust with the tubercle hanging to it
may float in and flavor the rump-steak, and the
fly may browse
on the sausage
meat after
he has put
in half-
time in
the garb-
age box.

Melbourne Herald lately published par-
ticulars of some dreadful children. One cherub,
Frankie, had attended school for ten years with-
out missing: a day; another, Murray, had been
similarly incorrigible for nine years; while the
last of the trio, Bertie, had done the dismal deed
for three years. Beside those, there are four other
members of the same family who have earned
certificates for flagrant regularity at school. At
which this paper is forced to remark bleakly :
“ What a pitiable family ! ”
THE ESSENTIAL CLUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were no new developments last night, Sunday
being an awkward day on which to follow a clue. —Daily
paper.
When I was tender, fresh and green,
Like parsley wet with dew
(A common state at seventeen),
I thought much of The Clue.
To novels filled with blood and crime
My nose I used to glue,
And wasted precious years of time
In following The Clue.
The spilt doubloon—the broken twig—
The sleuthhound’s subtle art,
‘‘Five paces to right and DIG I”
These things I took to heart.
Deduction and an eagle glance,
I knew, all plots revealed ;
These things and never evil chance
The fate of villains sealed.
With dbadlv skill and whiskers false,
Detectives swamped the band ;
(The band that never played a waltz
Upon the sea or land).
Upon their hands and knees they traced
Th ■ footprints in the slime ;
The swiftest animal they chased
Was caught and caged in time.
“ Run for your life 1 They're on the track! ”
The villain promptly fled ;
Yet evermore they haled him back
Alive—or filled with lead.
Dull Sunday was to them the same
As any other day ;
Fierce and alert, they played the game
And made their legal hay.
Ne’er at the tart charlady’s door
Did those men wait in doubt ;
Never her aid did they implore,
Or curse when she was out.
But times are changed. The sleutldiound too
Is not what he was once :
He has to hunt the gentle Clue
Like any other dunce.
So, when the washerwoman’s fled
Upon the church ward track,
The Law sits darkly in the shed
And waits till she comes back.
And if, perchance, she stays away
The Law looks very blue,
And says it is an awkward day
For following a Clue.

Field-Admiral and Commodore-in-land On-
slow is stirring up the Age of Consent trouble
again in N.S.W. Assembly, with his proposal to
protect girls up to sweet sixteen. Why not go
back at once to Constantine’s laws of 16 centuries
ago? That imperial moralist fixed the age of
consent at 25, and the man who abducted or
seduced a maiden under this age was either burnt
alive or torn to pieces by wild beasts. If the lady
confessed that she was willing, it didn’t save the
man ; it only got her also burnt or eaten in public
by depraved animals. If the parents, desirous of
hushing up the scandal, didn’t prosecute, all their
goods were confiscated to the Consolidated
Revenue, and they themselves were exiled. Any-
body might become a prosecutor, and there were
no silly questions asked. Slaves who were
suspected of knowing anything about the matter
were burnt alive or had to swallow melted lead.
Now, that was a thorough-going sort of a law, and
good Christian Tories like the gallant colonel should
place it on the mother State’s statute-book. True,
Constantine didn’t quite succeed in stamping out
the human nature in youth and maid ; but a judi-
cious combination of his system and that of the
blessed Origen would surely do the trick.
* * * *
“ A.E.” writes :
It has often struck me that papers should be compelled
by law to print their false information in red ink.
The S. M. Herald (24/7/'O9) furnishes a case in point.
“H.M.S. Pelorus, 2300 Miles up the Amazon,” is the
heading of a column, written by someone who evidentlv
wishes to appear so intimat ■ with the Pelorus and all who
sail in her that he even tells us she is “ a happy ship,” a
fact which no one outside the immediate circle of ship’s
company and officers could possibly be aware of. He
<roes on to give credit to Sir Percy Scott for sending the
Pelorus, belonging to the Second CruiserSqiiadron (which
squadron, he says, guards British interests in the South
Atlantic) up the big river.
Now, he Pelorus was attached to the Cape of Good
Hope station, and has no more to do with Sir Percy or anv
otherScotr. than I have. The Second Cruiser Squadron has
no more to do with the South Atlantic than it has with the
Tasman Sea ; while if anyone deserves credit for the
cruise of the Pelorus it is Sir John Fisher.
Then the writer condescends to lighten our darkness
as to the Pelorus herself. She, we' read with hated
breath, is alight-draught, 80-knot, heavily-armed, third-
class cruiser of 1100 tons; which is equivalent to saying
that, Bill Squires is the feather-weight champion sprinter
of the world, has the physique and muscles of Sandow,
and, moreover, is a third-class bicycle jockey, weighing
five stone ten.
The poor little Pelorus (she takes her name from a
certain pilot who ran King Hannibal ashore, and con-
sequently had his head chopped off by that not alto«-ether-
to-be-blamed monarch) is small enough, but 1100 tons
as a matter of fact, she is 2135. To be heavily armed and
yet a third-class cruiser is too palpably absurd a state-
ment to call for criticism. I remember we—for I happen
once to have been navigator of the Pelorus—used to call
our gunnery-lieutenant, “Efficiency P Guns," the "p”
standing for “ pop,” and illustrative of our contempt f6r
the tiny four-inch he so assiduously used to cultivate.
And then the 30 knots—when the modern Indomitable
trumpeted far and wide as the fastest cruiser in the
world, has never reached 26, and the fastest turbine
destroyer in the world barely does 34 knots. The poor old
Pelorus may in her palmy days have done 19 for (sav) a
couple of minutes, though I personally rather doubt it.
The Herald’s writer also remarks that “ the little white
warship steamed gaily away,” which would be all ri»ht
only the Pelorus is painted grey.
The Pelorus (sister ships are the Pioneer and Pyramus)
is chiefly famous from the fact that it was while ‘a guest
of her captain’s that Kipling wrote his “Fleet in Being ”
and it was on her deck he heard, or thought he did, the
marine sentry say, to the signalman t “Go upon the ’igh
and lofty bridge, and persecute your arduous advo-
cation.”

“Me]b.” : A remarkably creditable “ Ju-
bilee Book of the City of Footscrav ” is just out.
The overflowing democratic suburbs of Footscray
and Oollingwood Flat are about the best managed
in this whole city. The eloquential Footscray
Jubilee Book takes for its motto :
God gave all men all earth to love ;
But, since our hearts are small,
Ordained for each one spot should prove
Beloved over all.
And this is Footscray ! Stinkopolis ! The gibe
of the music halls! A Yankee' vaudeville artist
will hardly have been in Melbourne a week before
lie or she has a cut at Footscray. It is the place
where, last year, a most successful ladies’ fancy
hall was organised. Half of the ladies masque-
raded as men—jockeys, stockmen, cavaliers, and
so forth. Another gibe is Bonverie-street, Carl-
ton. Always understood, with a roar of mirth, to
be the focus of larrikinism, whereas tMre is no
such thing in its aristocratic shades. Then, again,
there is the standing joke of the Reilly-street
drain, a perennial stream of pure, sparkling water
running in a Milestone channel through Colling-
wood Flat. Of course, such myths have their
life, although it is often a long one. Little
Bourke-street has become so respectable that you
can only raise a laugh over it in the Bakblox. It
is not funny much nearer than Menindie. Old
Tottieville, in Lonsdale-street East, is partly
turned over to Gal Lue and Co., the cabinet-
makers, and the rest of it is respectable lodgings.
Even its two pubs have been knocked on the
head.

A remarkable youngster who seems likely
to call for a lot of attention during the next few
V* a ts l ,as just had a little of it from a Victorian
Children’s Court. On June 4 the hut of old John
Robinson, of Katamatite, was burned to the
ground, and as the old man was inside
when the accident happened, it looked at first
like a case of reading in bed or capsizing a lamp.
But the old man, it turned out, had considerable
moneys in his possession, all in £1 notes folded in
a particular way and wearing a peculiar odor ;
and when the remarkable youngster before
hinted at was presently noticed buying a bike and
sundry other articles, and paying for them with
similarly-marked and scented notes, even the
police came to certain conclusions. Then the
‘ V |? Un ?* :er a h about it, finally assuring
the shocked force that after the conflagration
there was “nothing left of old Robinson hut his
paunch.” The Court is holding the youngster
over for further consideration ; all it sees clearly
so far is that he isn’t a desirable infant to have
wandering around any township.
THE HUMOROUS FOWL.
"I hit him! I saw it distinctly !”
“Perhaps ’e thinks you're only larkin', sir. Give 'im another!"
That amazing Orangeman, Snowball, of
Melbourne, recently got this off on a Victorian
country audience
There would have been a steady flow of immigrants to
the shores of Australia only for tire underhand influence
of the Catholic Church.
A most consistent toiler in the cause of retro-
gression is the Snowball fraternity. Itverv time
the community is on the point of tracing the
source of any great social evil, some Snowball or
other rushes in to draw a reddish herring across
the track by assuring all and sundry that
the trouble, whatever it is, doesn’t arise through
sweating, rack-renting, land-monopoly, borrow-
ing, lack of a good Building Act, lack of irriga-
tion, lack of sanitation, Freetrade, adulteration,
the Congested Population policy, or any other
removable cause, but is solely owing to “ Rome.”
And as this country can’t get at “Rome,” that
means that it must just sit down and let the evil
goon. The people who live on ancient evils and
abusesshould pay a handsome salary to thefanatics
who divert attention from their ill-deeds by say-
ing that all the consequences thereof are owing to
“Rome.”
A STALE FISH YARN.
THE MAID : “ These fish aren't fresh.”
THE PUVEYOR OF FISH : “ Carn't you see the
fresh seaweed clinging to 'em?”
THE MAID : “ Well, why couldn't you catch the
fish at the same time as the seaweed?"
“Dico”: The Sydney rock-choppers’
calling, as shown in the July Lone Hand, is
deadly enough, God knows ; yet it is not without
parallel. I was lately shown a group photo, of an
afternoon shift of miners, taken about ten years
ago at one of the oldest quartz mines in Ballarat
East. Out of the 22 men in the picture, nine
have since died of miners’ complaint. When we
consider that some in the group were surface-men,
and so exempt from the complaint, it will be seen
that the percentage of deaths from this disease
among those who delve in the stomach of the
earth is terrible enough. But listen : Old Tom
Ferguson, a shift boss, once went into a rise in
this same Ballarat mine to sample the air. He
came down pnffi'ing, but reassured. “ The candle
will na burrn, but it’s no so bad ” he said, and up
they went!
The explanations made in the press about
the ease with which an unwed mother may place
her child in a home, asylum, or similar institution
in Sydney merely reveal the density of the official
mind. Some institutions may he as good as
described, but how are girls, generally friendless
and often ignorant, to know where they are or
how to get to them ? The idea of a State Found-
ling Institution would be easily grasped. It
would bulk big as a structure, and would be talked
of as openly as Dariinghurst Gaol
or the Sydney Hospital. A mul-
titude of poky little places, run
by poky little men, in poky little
back streets —places with differ-
ent names, different rules, and
different entrance qualifications
—leads to confusion and be-
wilderment, and the harried girl
ends by not finding any of them.
She doesn’t know in what part
of the directory to look for them,
and a policeman can’t tell her
where they hang out. When
society desires to save the lives
of its waifs it will say so by
opening a State Hospice for
them, and cease to niggle in
back streets with little twopenny
shows run by twopenny commit-
tees, which often seem far less
anxious to rescue the child than
to find out all the interesting details about the
mother.
Courts having lately shown a certain
amount of prejudice against the milkman’s playful
habit of putting water in the cans, and thus
swindling the parents and starving the infants,
Sydney and suburban retailers have adopted a
new fashion in thievery. No less than eight
dairymen were asked to call in at the Paddington
Court the other morning, and in almost every
case it was found that the swindle was worked
bv means of dents in the measuring cans. Most
of the owners were very shocked when
they were told that they were cheats and
thieves; it had never occurred to them that
if they bulged in the side of the quart pot
it wouldn’t hold a quart. One sinner put
up the amazing plea that he only supplied poor
people; but the stupid Magistrate somehow
couldn’t see that, while it might be wicked to rob
a man who has a lot, it really isn’t of any conse-
quence if you rob a man who only has a little.
Still for some reason or other, while most of the
defendants were fined £5 or a month, this pro-
pounder of horribly bad excuses only fell in to the
extent of £3 or 21 days. Apparently the law fixes
it that way at present; but next time the law is
overhauled" The Bulletin will rise to move that
the clause be amended by striking out “£3 or.”
Justice Pring, of N.S.W., lias been hold-
ing forth as to why people don’t go to
church. Well, the reason why Harry Holland, at
all events, isn't in his accustomed tabernacle is
that Mr. Pring gave him two years’ gaol when
three months would have filled the bill. And
possibly, after that remarkable sentence, some
other people stay away because Mr. Pring goes.
“DRAMA,” AS SEEN BY THE COMIC
ARTIST.
GENERAL CHORUS OF VOICES: “At last we are
on the right track! ”
“ Kalo ” : Has Wade’s legislation killed
off the exploiter of subtle crafts? Not by a hat-
ful. Women whose names were continually pro-
minent in the ad vertising columns of the dailies
before the new law passed now tout on their own
account, and make, if anything, more money than
before, and that without any outlay. The new
system is to hawk from door to door little com-
modities for women. It is a very flour and busy
landlady who will refuse to look at the wares
offered by a specious beldame with a taking
manner. A word dropped casually about “the
cards” is taken in the right spirit nine times out
of ten, and in half an hour the hag departs richer
by sundry shillings, and with fragments of Wade's
fractured legislation clinging all over her.
THE LONELY BUT LOGICAL LOYALIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Queen Alexandra has a very clever parrot at Sandring-
ham that can hum all sorts of tunes, and every morning
cries out “God Save the Queen!” when her Majesty
takes her place at her own particular tea table in the
Hall. — News item.
The prisoned loyalist,
Thrusting his head between
The cage bars, with a twist,
Cries out, “ God Save the Queen ! ”
“God Save the Queen !” The cry
The parrot learnt by rote
Rings stridently on. high
As swells his feathered"throat.
As H.M. takes her place,
Heyond the walls, I ween,
No well-fed populace
Are crying “Save the Queen !"
Only the tutored fowl,
Hung high above the meal,
In one discordant howl
To God makes the appeal.
Then sinks the feathered priest
Into a mood profound ;
Or has a crackling feast
And casts the husks around.
Unto his loyal prayer
That dean in green or blue
To add will never dare,
“ And feed her people too 1 ”
But, in his vestments gay,
And ’prisoned in his church,
He shouts day after day
High on his altar-perch.
His living is secure ;
Protected—unafraid,
Whilst monarchies endure,
lie need not fear Freetrade 1
For one short prayer each day
They 1111 his ev’ry need ;
Ilis stipend do they pay
In water and in seed.
A loyal subject he
And logical as well,
Who prays right heartily
When clangs the breakfast bell.
He hath two reasons good
For shouting, and I think
That one of them is Food,
(The other one is Drink).
N.S.W.
A HORRID SOCIALIST.

“ Boswell” : Aboriginal scribes of various
calibres have recently descanted on the numerous
vocations of some bush publicans, but what are
they compared with the multitudinousness of the
mixed undertakings of the bush pub’s man-of-all-
worlc. . I stayed recently at a roadside “hot-el”
where the drudge fulfilled daily the following
programme :—Rise at 6.30 and light three
fires ready for the missus and daughter.
Milk two cows and feed various horses.
Return to the kitchen in time to help the
women in preparation of breakfast. After
the morning meal, release the ducks from
tbeir prison-house, gather eggs, feed
ducks, geese, fowls, pigs, dogs and cats ;
assist in washing up breakfast dishes,
cut sufficient wood for the day’s
fires, convey same into kitchen,
act as kitchenman in dinner pre-
parations, rush away at intervals
to groom and feed visitors’
horses, and assist between whiles
at sweeping and scrubbing the
various rooms and passages of
the pub, clean fowlhouses and
act as general scavenger. Next,
help dish up the midday meal and
wait at table, if the daughter has the
tired feeling. Immediately after dinner
yoke up a horse and dray and cart
wood, sand, or manure at the landlord’s
behest, with an occasional break to
help that worthy in the cellar ; repair
fences ; cut blackberry hedges ; effect
plumbing repairs to the roof, besides
sundry trifles such as gardening, carpen-
tering at odd jobs, and blacksmithing.
After 5 p.m. feed poultry, horses and
porkers again, pen up calves and house
up ducks, chain dogs, collect sufficient
kindling wood fo« morning’s tires, assist
the women in getting tea ready, and,
that meal being disposed of, wash up,
clean harness and put a radiance on the
children’s boots. _ Then he is at liberty
to “make one” in a four-handed game
of euchre, for drinks of course, at which
sport he duly blews the woeful pittance so
grievously earned during the past 14| hours.
In conversation with this man I learned
that he received the princely wage of 12s. a
week, the stable perks being practically nil;
and that Boniface, who sits smoking on the
front verandah while his slave toils, fre-
quently grumbles that the slave is lazy and “ does
nothing.” And the missus gravely warns him that
the “boss” is very dissatisfied, and if he doesn’t
improve they will have to get somebody else.
“Silas Snell”: Saw the faithful tyke
put to a new use along the Gembrook (Vic.) line
the other day. Was interested in a man prowling
about a paddock with a large basket. He was
accompanied by an ordinary, cross-bred cattle-
dog, which ran fussily hither and elsewhere, occa-
sionally putting up a yap or stopping to scratch
for a moment at the soft soil. I investigated, and
found that the man with the basket was a profes-
sional mushroomer, and the dog an expert finder
of the vegetable. Spot has been three years in
the business, and has a marvellous mushroom
instinct; he can find the fungi under the earth or
as an outcrop. With his assistance, this veteran
with the basket makes quite a little haul in that
time of the year when the mushroom puts up its
umbrella and faces the elements.

“ Cazique A remarkable performance
was put up by a hair seal, a few days ago, in the
South Island of Maoriland. It was found on a
farm on Awarua Plains, to reach which it must
have worked its way up the Mokotua Creek, from
the New River estuary, a distance of nearly nine
miles, and then tramped inland over ploughed
ground and tussocks for about three-quarters of a
mile. The animal measured 9ft. from nose to
tail. It looked like an old sundowner, being
scarred, its teeth badly broken and one eye miss-
ing. What induced it to go on the wallaby is
not known, but possibly it was chased by a hostile
seal.

‘‘ H. Phelthatt ” : Owing to the absence
in our country towns of botanical gardens, ocean
beaches, and other pleasant public resorts, where
the sunny Sabbath afternoons may be peacefully
slept, read, eaten, and drunk away, the whole
responsibility of entertaining a dull community
falls on the local cemetery. It certainly does its
level best; but it is restricted to meagre
detail concerning its permanent guests, and can’t
help being dull. The populace passes reverently
from tomb to tomb, and after packing its memory
with bare names and ages, steps out into the cool,
still twilight to cogitate on what an awful thing
it must be to be dead. What is wanted is more
detail, more reading matter, more reminiscence.
How much more interesting the Bluegum family
plot could be made. For instance
William Charles Bluegum. Age, 102 years. Dropped
dead at Kelly’s pub. Notorious cattle duffer.
He left this world of strife and sin,
And now he boards at the Angel Inn.
William Charles Bluegum, jun. Age, 57. Killed by a
Tattersall’s sweep. A chip off Che old block.
Alwyn Furnleigh Graham Bluegum. Age, 2 years and
4 weeks. Died from eating match-heads
She is not dead. A Gipsy angel stole
Our tiny flower for a buttonhole.
A graveyard guide might also be compiled by the
town clerk to supply any further information
required.

“ Dux ” : The finish for the Maori Grass-
Fed Handicap was desperately exciting. Waipiro
and Blueskin raced neck and neck to the white
stump 20 yards from home, where Waipiro forged
ahead and won all out by a length. Up went
Blueskin’s number in a flash, and a crowd of pro-
testing blacks and whites and browns heaved
themselves up to the judge’s kerosene box and
asked whaffor. “Now, look here, you plokes,”
Said the Maori judge severely, “ what for you kick
up all te row, anyhow !
Blueskin, he win py half
a head, I tell you ! Thiste
first plurry win I have

round to collect.

“Alec Zander”: “ The Fisheries ”at Bre-
warrina (N.S.W.), recently mentioned in Thk
Bulletin, although one of the few striking in-
stances of aboriginal ingenuity, pale into insigni-
ficance in comparison with one I have seen
near Innamincka, on Cooper’s Creek (S.A.).
These yards are in a narrow channel con-
necting Innamincka and Cullumurrow water-
holes. They are bolder in design—much larger
stones being used—and the maze is much more in-
tricate than in the case of the Brewarrina en-
gineering feat. I have seen 20 fish, ranging in
weight from anything up to 10 or 12 pounds, for
one night’s trapping, and during the three years
I was on the station the 50 or 60 blacks there
obtained a constant supply of fish from this repro-
ductive public work.
“ Vigilans ” : New South Wales is strug-
gling hard to stop the cattle tick from coming in
from Queensland. A quarantine fence of wire-
netting is erected eight miles from Murwillum-
bah, and neither horses nor cattie are allowed
to pass that barrier. Two other fences are
met before you reach the Richmond, where
they spray even your saddle nag. Neverthe-
less, the tick is almost sure to come in time
right down the coast. I shot a kangaroo
the other day near the Tweed, and found
three ticks on him. I also took one off a
cow on a dairy farm and shut it up; when
next I looked at it. it had died, but had
left thousands of eggs in its place. (A
tick will lay 3000 eggs.) Ten years ago
I wrote in The Bulletin that the pest
would arrive in N.S. W. in 10 or 12 years.
At that time in the Gulf country,
pastoralists were losing 75 per cent, of
their stock, and cows did not calve.
To-day the Gulf cattle are immune,
and stock-owners do not trouble about
dipping. This year, along the Queens-
land coast, dairymen have had great
losses —fully 20 per cent. Inoculation
and dipping are imperative, but both
these things play havoc with stock—
I recently saw a score of cattle die
from bad virus. N. S. Wales doesn’t
realise what a big fight its Stock De-
partment is waging up North. Had there
been Federal control 10 years ago, things
might have been different; but Queensland played
with the danger, and now it seems practically
impossible to keep the curse from following its
course right down to Victoria.

“ Whaffor ” : I find Port Macquarie one
of the most delightful holiday resorts on the coast
of N.S.W., but no decent-sized vessel can cross
the bar. There are no finer fishing grounds;
duck-shooting is good, and the bathing not to
be beaten. I helped bring in 50 baskets of
bream, and on the pilot bodt a day’s haul amounted
to 250 schnapper. Outside fishing and fisher folk
the old settlement is dead. The quaint old brick
buildings are fast falling into decay, and the ancient
cemetery, with its interesting inscriptions, is
becoming covered with lantana weed, another pest
introduced to this district as a horticultural
rarity. The Anglican Church, built in a severe
style, was opened in 1828, and is still in use. The
old high-backed box-pews remain—boxes wherein
the ungodly play euchre during service. The
Agricultural Society has enclosed the old gaol,
and uses one side for horse stalls.

Keview he finds no one cause and no one remedy for his

pride of men, who prefer idleness to accepting work at a
low wage."— Argus (lb/7/’09.)
Ninepence a day, and pumpkin-chops for breakfast, every

What truly proud man would not be by such a job
beguiled ?
Proud as a fowl in peacock’s duds the lazy blighter is
Who will not lift a hand to snatch the job that should be

He’ll hold his job whose true pride is his sore, financial
loss;
He’ll hold, proud bloke, his sweated lurk until the cows
come home,
And be no better off than Bill, who joblessly doth roam.
His inner man, with tucker coarse and post-an’-rail ill-
served,
May give him beans ; but his fine pride would suffer if he
swerved
From duty’s path to hunt a crib where he’d have jam for

“Myrtle ” : Near Atherton (N.Q.) a special
sort of log was recently cut for exhibition in
Brisbane. Its enormous girth made it impossible
to send it by rail—it wouldn’t fit in the tunnels.
So the bullock-driver furbished up his partially-
forgotton stock of language, took swearing exer-
cise on an empty stomach, got up a good muscle
on his curses, and drove the log to Gairns by
word of mouth.

“Kodak,” about a row in the flying
department:—
I witnessed a fierce business row last Saturday after-
noon. It was in the parrakeet’s division of the Sydney
Botanic Gardens’ aviary, and the disturbance ranged over
three perches—or floors. My friend and self were wan-
dering past the cage, when we saw two of the
little green fellows standing a little apart from
the rest of the chattering flock. One of them
was listening sadly, with his beak buried amongst
his chin feathers and his hands folded under his wing-
coat-tails. The other—who was evidently his part-
ner—had his beak in the air and was shouting indignantly
that “ he’d have no more of it, and that if the staff would
not attend to his orders, then he’d sack every d d bird
of them, even if it wrecked the business.” The senior
partner listened glumly to the tirade, and, like a wise
fowl, did not once open his beak. Seeing the third part-
ner mooning along in their direction, he hastily excused
himself and flew up to the next perch, ostensibly to see
the foreman. The third partner doddered into the one
who was full of indignation, and was immediately' over-
whelmed with the history of the case in fierce bird
language and frequent curses. Recognising that
he had blundered, he shuddered and buried
his beak in his feathery whiskers even as the
other partner had done. But he did not get off so
lightly. The indignant partner came a hop closer and
chattered fiercely in his face so that he was almost
deafened and had to retreat one hop. The angry bird
followed him up and he had to hop again. He looked
just fit to fall off the perch with shame and rage when
the telephone saved him. (We couldn’t see the ’phone ;
but the infuriated partner suddenly fluttered away from
his victim, and, putting his beak close to the wall, started
to talk three times as fast and twice as loud as he had
done previously.) The partner who had been assailed
stood miserably waiting while the other shouted insults
over the wire, and told some bird that he’d see him
cooked before he accepted any more of his bald-headed
orders. During the progress of the telephone row it was
plain to see the miserable partner would have given his
tail feathers to have been on a different perch ; but he
was too stunned to fly. His claw§ convulsively' clutched
the perch and his beady blue eyes filmed a* the wild
partner yelled and chattered at the customer, and cursed
the exchange hen. When the ring-off came and the
transmitter was hung, up with a crash, that bird shud-
dered from beak to tail, and braced himself for another
blast of fury'. But it didn’t arrive ; instead, the wild
one shouted at him. “Come on now! I’m going up-
stairs to give that foreman h 1.” He shot upstairs
like a flash of green fire, and the other followed as fast as
he could fly. They' found the glum, lazy partner and the
sulky foreman wasting time in useless, gloomy chirpings,
and they fell upon them as one bird, and abused them
savagely up-perch and down-perch. The most ener-
getic and vitriolic blackguarding was done by the partner
who had himself been thrashed. He singled out the
glum, lazy' partner who had meanly allowed him to hop
straight into the trouble ; he told the glum partner what
he thought of him as a bird, and he didn’t desist until the
glum one turned tail and flew out to lunch. We caught
sight of him afterwards, having a seed at the tin in the
corner, and he was the most ashamed and miserable
feathered thing possible to imagine. What business do
birds go in for? Is it the aeroplane trade?

“ Silas Snell ” : The bush intellect moves
slowly, like the mills of God. No doubt the
moral processes of the person outback get there
eventually, but it generally happens that they are
long in transit. Take the authenticated case of
Jerry Oassin and his brother Arthur. It has to be
admitted that Cassin’s think material was even
more tardy than that of the ordinary bred and
born bushman, and Cassin looked it. He had a
mild, slothful eye and a dreamy expression. Some-
body said that if a mosquito bit Jerry Cassiri he
slapped himself a week later. One
day Mr. Oassin was tilling the soil
back of his house, when a small,
ruddy, tattered man, with a swag
like the stock of a Chow rag-picker,
clambered through the fence, dashed
at Jerry, embraced him in three
styles, and cried: “Wot, ole man,
yeh ain’t a-goin’ t’ say yeh don’t
reckernise yer own brother? ” Jerry
shook his head in a puzzled way,
and gazed silently at the newcomer.
“I’m Arthur,” said the swaggie,
prompting Cassin’s tired mind.
“Surely you remember Arthur?”
Cassin shook his head again, and
began urging the spade into the
ground with a large boot like an
ironclad. Presently he looked up.
“Bettergo inter the ’ouse, Arthur,”
he said, “’n’ get Nellie t’ giv’ yeh a
bite t’ eat.” Nellie was Cassin’s
eldest daughter, and Cassin was a
widower. Arthur had a bite to eat,
and stayed all night. He stayed
five days, and proved to be an om-
nivorous and ceaseless eater. He
would even eat in his sleep. Except-
ing for the remarkable energy he dis-
played in shifting provisions, Arthur
was a loafer of the old school. He didn’t
do a tap during those five days, but he
wore Cassin’s clothes, and he ran up an
account in Cassin’s name at the pub at
Twofold Siding. On the fifth evening
Bright, the horsedealer, came upon Jerry
kicking his brother through the fence.
After chasing Artie a quarter of a mile,
and hitting him nine times with a hoe,
Cassin returned. “What’s the meaning of
all this?” asked Bright. Jerry craped his jaw
wearily. “I jist remembered I nsever had a
brother Arthur,” he said.

When the N.S.W. country correspondent
is up against it for a par. he can generally fall back,
these times, on the fox. “The increase of foxes
in this district” is a stock line in the Sydney
daily. Condobolin is now paying £6OO a year for
dead foxes at 2s. 6d. per corpse, and the reddish
pest still spreads. A Forbes cocky lately lost
three full-grown rams in one night;‘and when
even the hostile and militant ram isn’t safe, the
question arises whether the horse won’t be eaten
next. In ail English fox-hunting county the.yokel
who first, spies Reynard is alleged by the fox-
hunting novelist to get 2s. 6d. for the glad news.
Here the beastly news can be got for nothing, and
tha.2s. 6d. isn’t paid till the animal is quite dead.

TO MILPARINKA!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At a public meeting held recently at Milparinka (Out-

condemning Mr. Wade’s anti-Federal attitude were
carried.
You are lost amidst the distance in the mulga and the
sand ;
You are the White Man’s outpost in a lorn and lonely
land —
Yet it seemeth, Milparinka, that you really understand !
Out there amidst the silence, where life is drab and
drear,
How spacious is your vision, how noble and how clear—
How punjr and how pulseless the Little Men appear !
Where the things that really matter are mainly things of
chance;
Where a thousand miles of desert is but a circumstance ;
Where Romance is grimly real —and the Real is Romance.
Where unrelenting Greatness is a cure for all conceit,
Where thoughts might soar unhampered, and hearts have
room to beat;
Afar from stuffy temples and the babel of the street.
Out there amidst the Vastness, in the mulga and the
sand,
I’d send the Little People together in a band . . .
You’d teach them, Milparinka, to Truly Understand 1

(The Old Smuggler Bottle)
BEST OF QUALITY.
PERFECT PURITY.
OF GREAT INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE
TO STOUT PERSONS.
There is now being disseminated broadcast
throughout the country a recipe of the greatest
value to stout persons who are longing to get thin,
but have not succeeded in finding the way. It is
the least costly of remedies for corpulency, and
you can make the mixture yourself after obtain-
ing following harmless ingredients at your
chemist s One half-ounce of Marmola, one ounce
of fluid extract of Glycyrrhiza 8.P., one ounce of
pure Glycerine 8.P., and Peppermint Water to
make six ounces in all. Simple, is it not ? Yet it
will work positive wonders. You need not go in
for dieting or exercising ; you needn’t put yourself
out m the least. Eat what you fancy ; do as you
please. The dose to be taken is two teaspoonfuls
after meals and at bedtime. This mixture will
often make a very stout man or woman lose from
14 to 18 ounces in a single day ; and it will quickly
restore vitality and muscular power. The trim
figure will not have been regained at the expense
of health ; quite the contrary. The skin and
complexion will regain purity and color, the
blood being purified ; while the heart’s action will
be improved, if it was previously weak.*
Now if from any sudden chill
A cold your nose should tint,
On no account take anything
For it but Peppermint.
We are all liable to colds
Or frequently to cough ;
On hand keep Woods’mighty Cure,
Don’t put this matter off.*
Cures
Coughs
Angler's Emulsion is unequalled for
coughs, bronchitis and all lung affec-
tions. By its soothing and healing
effects it stops the cough, allays inflam-
mation, improves the
breathing and makes
expectoration easy. At
the same time it keeps
the digestive organs
healthy and has a won-
derfully invigorating
influence upon the
general health. One
day’s trial will convince
you of its soothing,
cough - allaying, lun g-
healing power. Forfree

JOHN BRUNTON, THE GREAT SCENIC
ARTIST , DECEASED.
John Jackson Calvert, on his retire-
ment from the office of Clerk of Parliaments of
N.S. W. (held since 1871), intends to publish a
constitutional history of N.S. W. He was clerk of
select committees in the Assembly when Respon-
sible Government was inaugurated, 53 years aero,
and he lias taken notes all the time. He is the
first living authority on the records, personal and
political, of Deas Thomson, Wentworth, Martin,
Darvall, Parker, Donaldson, Cowper, Parkes,
Robertson, Hay, Murray, Manning, Nichols,
Campbell, Dailey, Samuel, Eager, Hargrave,
Faucett, Plunkett, Arnold, Joseph Docker, Isaacs,
Sutherland, Butler, Lloyd, Garrett, Stuart, and
hundreds of early Parliamentarians. John Jack-
son intends to write up all these people when he
becomes old; but then he never becomes any older
somehow.
Pook, of Melbourne, the man who sold all
his goods as directed by the Scripture and gave
to the poor, is now a declared madman, and the
Master in Lunacy has forcibly recaptured one of
his benefactions—a sum of £liso. So still another
question arises : “ Can a Christian avoid being a
lunatic?”
“N.F.” : The Bulletin (22/7/ 09) alleges
that E. S. Emerson (“Milky White”) is the
baldest-headed poet in these latitudes. But I’ll
back Frank Morton for greater famine of hair
than Emerson, if you don’t disqualify Morton
from the competition on the ground that he’s in
Maoriland these days.
“ Lost Soul” : The recent death of ancient
Adelaide solicitor Arthur Hardy is a reminder
that the S. A. climate should be advertised more.
A. Bickford, Arthur Hardy and T. S. Reed all
came to Australia as young men for the benefit of
their health. Pickford died recently at nearly 90,
Hardy passed out at about the same age, while
Reed is still roaming the city streets, though his
years are 93 or thereabouts.
It is not clear that Papua is yet quite at
rest over its administrative problem. Staniforth
Smith is too good a man to be thrown away on
his Excellency Murray, and Murray is too good a
man to be thrown away on Smith. That’s said to
be how the two men feel. Both are big. active,
and enthusiastic. Both like ad venture and tropic
life. Smith is wealthy; the Westralian gold
mines are still backing him. Murray, too, is
wealthy, for he doesn’t much care for.money. In
this sense Murray is more ready to play a daring
game than Smith. And, in the meantime, both
are so far away that it takes a long time for the
Federal Government to find out what they’re
doing.
Captain R. L. Boldchild, one of Sydney’s
ancient mariners, died at Neutral Bay on Friday
night, aged fi2 years. He was mate of the Loch Earn
when that vessel cut down the French passenger
ship Ville du Havre in the Atlantic. The ships
were off the Azores when the disaster happened.
The French ship sank almost immediately with
220 people still on board. The Loch Earn kept
afloat with difficulty for six days, and was then
abandoned. A French court found that the
Loch Earn was responsible, and ordered its
owners to nay damages. A British Court decided
that the Ville du Havre was responsible, and
ordered its owners to pay damages. Nobody paid
any damages.
Within a little over 12 months South Aus-
tralia has buried four men who, for a longer or
shorter time, held the State Premiership. The
magnificent Kingston was the first to go ; he
crossed the bar on May 11, 1908. In October,
1908, “Sudden” Solomon passed out. May 31.
1909, was a day of mourning for the death of
Thomas Price, and now the departure of Frederick
Holder completes the quartette. Holder was
Premier twice—for three months and then for 17
months. Kingston lasted 6J years ; Solomon,
one week ; Price about four years. They were
big imposing figures in politics—all except Solo-
mon, who was hardly large enough for the com-
pany he was in.
Anglican Bishop Riley, who is having
some controversies on doctrinal questions over at
Perth (W. A.), once was threatened with trouble,
and ran like Hell. That is a startling figure of
speech to apply to a bishop's movements, but the
gaitered one takes full responsibility for it. He
was caught in a heavy sea on the west, coast one
night, and the little sloop seemed to be going
under, so the captain tried to send up a new-
fangled sort of rocket, as a sign of distress. Instead,
however, of ascending, the thing persisted in
dancing about, the deck, preliminary to explosion.
“ What shall I do?” asked the Bishop, when the
combustible rushed at him and dodged between
his legs. “Run like Hell !” said the skipper. The
Bishop adds, “I ran.”
On Justice George Bowen Simpson’s re-
tirement from the N.S.W. Bench in January
next, after a term of 15 years. Justice Henry
Emanuel Cohen (appointed Sept. 10. 1896) will
become senior puisne Judge. The Supreme
Court Bench of a Chief Justice and six puisne
Justices (Cohen and A. H. Simpson excepted)
will then be very new to office. From Stephen
the elder to Stephen the younger (1839 to 1887—
48 years) 14 Judges were appointed ; from Owen
to Sly (1887 to 1908—21 years) 10 Judges were
appointed. Alfred Stenhen sat on the bench 34
years and six months. Wilde sat 11 months. Foster
sat for less than six years, when he retired through
ill health. He is a long-lived invalid and is still
on deck with his drawn pension in his hand.
“ Larry ” Harnett was not only Sergeant-
at-Arms of the N S. W. Assembly for 35 years ; he
was also the entertainer of the “distinguished
visitor” and “honored guest,” at his own ex-
pense. for the Governments of Parlies, Robert-
son, Farnell, Stuart, Bibbs, Jennings, Reid,
Lyne. See, Carruthers and Wade. No doubt he
would have entertained for a Waddell Govern-
ment also. had it faced Parliament. In a similar
capacity he acted for Speakers Arnold, Allen,
Barton, Young, Abbott and MeCourt. Some
Ministers and Speakers recognised that visitors
and guests have thirsts and appetites, which cost
money. Others forget that refreshments had to
be paid for, and either carelessly or wilfully
thrust the company on the genial and generous
Larry, who, when he showed strangers over the
House, did not steer them clear of the refresh-
ments department. Entertainment was known to
be a heavy tax on Larry, and it is not recorded
that any rich member remembered him in his will
or otherwise reimbursed him for the enforced
outlay.
FOR FODDER.
CHAUFFEUR: “I suppose, now, you wouldn't believe this car was 40 horse-power?"
McGUIRE: “Forty hor-r-se power I Look at that! Beyor, it'll cost yez somethin' fer oats! ”
After 27 years of it, N.S.W. Crown Prose-
cutor Walton L. Merewether has retired from
the task of telling’Sonah and the jury the strength
of the evidence against the gentleman in the dock.
One of the first \I.A. s of Sydney University, he
was called to the Bar in 1871: and hut three prac-
tising barristers—John Armstrong, C. E. Pilcher,
and C. B. Stephen—were there when he arrived.
In his time Mr. Merewether saved the country
tens of thousands of pounds in upkeep of prisons
simply by giving the accused the benefit of any
doubt that might be lurking in the depositions.
Here follows an example of the benefits of
a superior education. It is an amendment moved
by Fairbairn (Vic.) in the House of Represent-
atives :
Thar, the Government’s declaration that consideration
is being given to the adjustment of anomalies in the
tariff, and any Bill on the subject, will, as a matter of
course, sifeguard the interests, of the producers and
manufacturers of the Commonwealth, each anomaly will
be dealt with according to its character, the general
policy of the existing tariff being maintained, is satis-
factory.
It is questionable whether anybody in the
despised Labah pahty would be guilty of such
horrible composition. In fact, it should be called
deco reposition.
“ Micuwber ” : Recently-deceased Lean
Fore, manager of the Tung Wah Times, one of
the two Chinese papers of Sydney, had two fail-
ings—a wish to be considered “one of the boys,”
and a craving for cigarettes and opium. The
former cost him several hundred pounds recently,
and the latter cost him his life. Apart from his
usual opium jaunts. Fore smoked on an average
14 packets of cigarettes and 10 (or so) cigars daily.
Furthermore, he and his Chinese wife utterly
failed to get their children to talk Chinese; and
that was another load on Fore’s mind. So he
wrote a letter or two, committing the youngsters
to the care of friends, and went out.

“ J.S.” : Bulletin says (22/7/’O9) that one
John Thomas “claims to be the sole survivor of
the party which found the first gold in Victoria,”
on August 2, 1851. Turning up page 398 of the
Commonwealth Official Year Book, volume 1,
I find matter sufficient to dispute the claims of
John T. It says there :
The Hon. W. Campbell discovered the precious metal
in March, 1850, at Clunes, but concealed the fact tempo-
rarily through fear lest the announcement should prove
injurious to the squatter on whose nil the discovery was
made, and the gold discovery committee was not notified
until the Bth July, 1851. On the sth July, 1851, notifica-
tion was made of the discovery of gold in the Yarra
Ranges by Mr. L. J. Nichel. Mr. James Esmond dis-
covered gold in quartz at the Pyrenees Mountains, the
notification being made on the stii July, and soon after
the numerous fields near Mount Alexander were opened
up.
From which it would appear that the party of J.
Thomas was several laps behind in the race.
At long last Richard Denis Meagher, of
the Dean case, has been allowed to resume busi-
ness as a Gentleman One in Sydney. The final
flippant jest of the Court was to order him to
pay the Costs incurred by the Law Institute in
unsuccessfully opposing his reinstatement. There
is a lot of subdued mirth about a Full Court at
times. Meagher, though still a young man, is one
of the very few survivors of the Dean episode.
Salomons, Crick, Windeyer and Want are gone.
G eorge Dean is supposed to be gone; at least,
if he isn’t gone to his long home he
has departed to Westralia, or some place. The
Opera House in, which Meagher lectured about
his experiences is gone. The old steam tram in
which be was “torn by conflicting emotions” is
gone. The old Ferry Co. whose boat George-
Dean steered is gone, and there is a new co. in its
place. The boat of which Dean was master is wholly
gone. The hangman who missed a job in connec-
tion with the famous poisoning case is gone—out
of business at all events. And the old gaol where
a part of the scene of the Dean episode was laid is
likely soon to go also.
N.S.W. Comptroller of Prisons, Captain
Frederick William Neitenstein, who retires
shortly, has put in 36 years trying to make the
crooked straight, or at least to prevent it getting
any more bent for the time being. He was born
in London in 1850, and after a spell in the mer-
cantile navy, joined the old Sydney training ship
Vernon in 1873 as a lieutenant. He became the
vessel’s commander in 1878, and boss of all the
gaols of the State in 18!)6. The Captain has hit
up a reputation among the world’s criminologists ;
and that his clients are sorry to hear that he is
going.
“ Teddy ” Aldridge, who had one claim to
immortality, died a few days ago in Adelaide.
For 20-odd years he kept a pub at Broken Hill
and hated it. It was on the corner which most of
the miners used to pass going to and coining from
the big mines ; and from them Teddy was always
a buyer of “ specimens,” and asked no questions.
There probably never was a group of mines con-
taining metals and minerals in so many and rare
forms ; plenty of them have not been found any-
where else. So the man at the corner pub made
a collection which a few years later was valued at
£20,000. Many of the specimens have no dupli-
cates, and there is now no hope of getting
duplicates. When he had duplicates ho sold
them to European and American museums.
Another section—by far the most complete and
valuable—he sold a few months ago for some
thousands to Hugh Dixson, who presented it to
Sydney University.
PITY THE POOR PLAYER.
The conduct of many women and girls of late has been
so outrageous that respectable orderly women are
ashamed to be seen at football matches for fear of being
mistaken for members of the shrieking sisterhood.
THE VALIANT JOHN: “Now, then, young
wuraman, just you leave the little fellar alone.
D’yez hear-r me! ”
“Boko”: Talking of our American
“cousins” and that “other branch of the Anglo-
Saxon race” which inhabits part of North
America, how is it so many Yankees are not of
Anglo-Saxon descent? Here are the names of the
Amurrikun boys’ baseball team which recently
played Victoria: Muheitn, Raphael, Wihr, Ca-
veney, Nagel, Glazerm, Waymihr, Burke and
Prang, with Peixoto as skipper. The only Anglo-
Saxon name is borne bv Burke, and there are grave
doubts about his classification as a Sassenach.
“THERE WILL BE SO MUCH TO LEARN!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The administrator of the Sydney Anglican Diocese has
received a letter from Archdeacon Wright, dealing with
his acceptance of the position of Archbishop of Sydney.
It states “ Much indulgence I shall need. There will he
so much to learn. Hut I shall do niv utmost to be an
apt and receptive learner—observing, 'and listening, and
thinking.”— News item.
When the sheep want holy feed,
Home-bred shepherds do we spurn
(“Much indulgence I shall need,
There will be so much to learn ”).
Very abject and so meek
Is the foreign shepherd’s wail ;
All unasked he bolts the leek
Whilst he’s packing up to sail.
Bid him dry the starting tear
And suppress the useless sob ;
If he will not do out here
Why does he accept the job i
If, like some new office-boy,
He dreads his incompetence,
Let him not his God annoy
(Bishops pester Providence).
Prayers for dryness—prayers for rain,
Ever on the skies they rap,
Turning off and on again,
As though Heaven were a tap.
“ I will listen, watch and think ! ”
Noble words 1 But now look here !
I would do the same (don't wink !)
For that shepherd’s screw per year !
Who would not a Bishop be?
Who the golden pence would spurn ?
One has but to sigh “ Ah me !
There will be so much to learn ! ”
“ There will be so much to learn,
Much indulgence I shall need ! ”
(But he need have no concern
Re the flock. They find the feed !)

If the co. has made £35,738 profit on the sale of £46,651
of house and £92,190 of landed property it has done ex-
cellently ; though whether it will do as well out of what
is left is by no means certain, for the chances are that
what is left is the least saleable. Still the outlook isun re
cheerful for ordinary shareholders, though their interest
is now too small to be of very much consequence. The
deferred pref. capital now amounts to £29,000, and the
ordinary capital is £3406 ; so at present the special reserve
exceeds the capital represented by these shares, and that
ought to guarantee them a 5 per cent. div. at any rate,
provided the later sales don’t bite large pieces out of tne
fund instead of helping it, and provided the fund is well
invested. Advances (apparently new transactions) are
growing ; and even after the properties in hand are dis-
posed of, it seems now as if the co. might have a future
with some profit in it.

Of the reserves £32,153 is a contingency fund provided
to make good any deficiencies in future realisations, it
was a most disastrous concern ; but one way and another
debenture holders are coming out of it better than for a
long time seemed likely. In a desperate struggle to save
a little for themselves out of the wreck, sliareholders
agreed in 1906-7 to put up another 10/- per share,
half-a-crown at a time, if the debenture holders
would stand off a little longer; and those calls
are now being got in. In 1893 there were
250,000 shares paid to £l, an uncalled capital of
£1,000,000 (£4 per share), and £994,764 of debentures.
Only £llos. per share now remains uncalled ; and of the
250,000 shares but 146,215 are alive. Helped by the calls
and the sale of properties at written down values(written
down mostly out of forfeited capital), more than three-
fourths of the debentures have been paid off. At one
time the holders-were content with about £BO ; but now
they want close -up to par. In fact, the directors are
empowered to pljrfehase up to £97 at any time; if not
enough offer at or hblpw that rate the retirements have
to be balloted for. This shows how things have gone
lately;— /

Losses may be made over the advances ; but the con-
tingency fund could now meet a depreciation of 10 per
cent, in both advances and properties in hand. Judging
by the results for the past 18 months, this should be more
than ample ; in fact, the prices realised have exceeded
the valuations by about 4 per cent. net. The present
capital seems therefore intact, and probably some of the
reserves as well; though whether this co. can profitably
use it after the debentures have been pot rid of still
remains to be proved. At present the revenue, after pay-
ing expenses but not interest, shows 4£ per cent, on the
total assets.

This little bank, whose one office is in liallarat, has a
spirit-level on the premises, judging by the evenness of
its profits.' True, they have a slight tilt upwards, and
that may be taken as a hint that, in the opinion of the
management, things are going i he right wa.v. Still, there
is no great movement in the business figures. Ten years
ago, both deposits and advances were within about
£30,000 of what they are to-day. The cash position is,
however, stronger, owing to the accumulation of surplus
profits in a liquid sitape. At June 30 the bank held a
substantial 38 per cent, of all its deposits and other debts
in cash, money at short call, or Government securi-
ties. Its own funds amount to £160,667 ; ns
total debts are only £244,471, so that the creditors are
tin isually well protected. It is quite possible that this bank
takesaeertain amount of personal-security business which
other non-local banks would mostly pass by ; but, even so,
the shareholders’ risks are reduced ow ing to the fact that,
of every £2 out in advances, £1 os. Od. is their own money.
Or, put m another way, in proportion to their own funds
(which, of course, have to protect invested deposits) tne
t >tal amount at risk is not half is great as it is in most
banks. One result is that the earnings are comparatively
small. On the basis of total funds (capital and reserves)
recent figures have been ;

There is no reason in the record of the past to look for
any striking movements in the future ; but there is a
ge eral. appearance of solidity; premises have been
written down to almost nothing; and the steady
accumulation of reserved profits is providing an insurance
fund against any ordinary disaster. Even now all the
non-liquid assets could slump 4s. lOd. in the £, and not
only the public’s money but the capital as well would
still be there.

Briefly this is the history of the co.’s capitalisation :
1898 : North Shore Go..in ex.stence; capital 160,000, to
which it had been increased from £40,000 in 1894.
1899; Sydney Kerries formed ; two £1 shares issued for
eacii share in old co.
1902 : 20,000 shares issued tit par.
1906 : 20,01)0 shares issued as > bonus.
1907 : 40,0u0 shares issued at par ; 10s. called up.
1908: Balance of 10s. on last issue of shares called up.
1909: Authorised capital of £200,000 having, all been
issued, resolution passed increasing the capital to
£400,000.
Of the present capital of £200,000 a total of £120,000 has
been paid up in cash, reckoning the £60,000 capital of the
old North Shore Kerry Go. as cash. That is, an average of
12s. per,share has been paid in coin; the other Bs. has been
paid out of profits and presented to shareholders. Now,
as shown above, preparation lias been made for further
new issn s by doubling the authorised capital ; but
when or how those extra shares will be issued hasn’t, of
course, been decided. Judging by the recent increase in
the amount of the disclosed profit, an i.-sue of some sort
will probably be announced before long. Other move-
ments can be traced in the following :
June, June, June, Dec., June,
i 960. 1905. 19)8. 1908. 1909.

Other assets 8,510 18,351 29,370 49,764 46,609
It is impossible to say what amount of profit is stuffed
away and hidden by writing down the ship property, etc..
Another way of saying niuch the same thing is that it is
impossible to tell exactly how much profit is collared
and used to pay for new boats, etc., without
being shown as profit. In June, 1905, ship property
stood at £61,326; it now stands at £70,058. Mean-
time these boats have been added:—Kaikai, Kailoa,
ivookooburra, and K ludali ; anil another new one will
be launched in a month or two. Thus except for £8732
these four steamers have been paid for out of revenue,
and progress payments have been made towards a fifth.
No doubt there has been depreciation ; but other boats
have been improved, which is a partial set-off to the
general wear and tear. Whether any land, etc., is also
paid for out of profits can’t unfortunately be traced in
the same way.
Sydney Ferries shares are now worth about
665. Supposing the whole 200,000 new shares are issued
at par, it means that the present holder of one share will
have two shares, which (if lie buys now at 665.) will cost
him in all 86s. If the 10 per cent. div. is continued, the
return on his investment will be £4 13s.—that is, after the
whole of the new 200,000 shares have been issued ; and it
may be years before the last go out. But if half of the
new shares are presented to shareholders as a bonus,
while the other half are issued at par, then the uhimate
return would be £5 ss. 3d. per cent, on an investment in
shares at the present price of 665. In this case also it lias
to be remembered that it may be years before the whole
of the new lot are issued ; and until they are issued the
return will be smaller. At present, for instance, and
until the first lot are issued, the return is only £3 os. 7d.
per cent.

The reserves are as follows: —Plant renewal, £9OOO ;
general reserve, £10,000; insurance fund, £7500; em-
ployers’ liability, £5OO ; public risk, £1451 ; and undivided
profit, £1143. Several of these reserves are doubtful
characters. Until the present term there was no insurance
fund in the new 00., which is a recent reconstruction of
the Port Jackson Go.-Op. S. S. Co.—the reconstruction
was carried through where the blank occurs in the table.
How much of its own insurance the co. carries hasn’t
transpired. It evidently has some outside policies,
because “insurance unexpired, £356” is among the
assets. If the co. now pays considerable sums into ils
own fund instead of to outside cos., it is clear that the
money is not in the best sense profit earned, though for
the time being it appears among the reserves, and there-
fore among the profits. An insurance fund is, how-
ever, a convenient way of concealing profits
if it suits a co. to conceal them, because
it may establish such a fund, though it has its property
fully covered by policies. Yet even if a co. has its pro-
perly thus covered some insurance fund is desirable,
because of the probable loss through dislocation of trade
in case a boat is destroyed. Tuere is always much doubt,
therefore, about an insurance fund, though there is
always the suspicion when a co. adds largely to it that it
is using the fund to hide profits. The only other fund to
which additions have lately been made is the public risk
reserve, £1451. For years this stood at £6OO, and was
utterly inadequate. And it is utterly inadequate still,
considering the enormous amount which is liable to be
claimed from theco. in the by no means impossible event
of a bad accident happening through the negligence of
the co. or its servants. This is a risk which has never
been properly recognised, otherwise the reserve would
have been built up long ago. The co. also writes off
something for depreciation ; but what it amounts to no-
body can tell from the published accounts. Still this
comparison may suggest something:—

In the past 12 months the book value of steamers has
thus increased by £10,289 ; yet in that time £14,129 at
least was paid on account of the thirrabra alone, and
£250 on account of the very newest steamer. Or put it
another way: £14,379 can be traced as having been
paid away for new steamers, yet the cash, etc., has in-
creased by £12,625, which includes, of course, the re-
serves mentioned above. While things go all right, then,
the co. is evidently on a very fine wicket. The authorised
capital is £250,000 in £1 shares ; 117,340 shares have been
issued paid up to 15s.

This co. serves the exceedingly fertile North Coast dis-
tricts of N. S. Wales, which the butter business has
boomed during the last few years. It has had a few
small competitors ; but it is old-established and power-
ful, and the competition hasn’t cut deeply. Now, how-
ever, the State is building a railway to connect Grafton
with the main northern system, and it probably won’t be
long before this line branches out to tap the chief pro-
ducing sections of the coast. Under ordinary circum-
stances the co. might successfully compete with the
railway, for the latter can t make any short cuts,
but has to climb out west before it runs south ;
but once the Stale has provided rail communi-
cation the chances are that it won’t feel inclined to spend
the largesums of money necessary to keep the bar-harbors
open to even moderate-sized coastal boats. Also theco.
has no longer got the services of that excellent Parlia-
mentary log-roller, John See, who for years was managing
director. Still the co. is going to make a good fight for
it. For years past it lias been increasing and improving
its fleet, and it is still on that job. This shows the chief
movements in the past 10 years :

It is clear that something is written off to provide for de-
preciation ; but what amount of revenue is disposed
of in that way isn’t mentioned. Of the reserves £49,072
consists of an insurance and repairs fund. This isn’t the
best sort of reserve, because the co. carries a good deal of
its own insurance ; though the ships stand in the books
at £234,320 (including money paid on account of new
steamers, of which three have been contracted for), the
insurances only total £112,050. But as to whether there
is an internal reserve—in other words, whether ships,
etc., have been written down below their true value—no
opinion can be expressed.

Besides the reserves mentioned above thereare —Premium
capital, £232,227 ; and meter replacement fund, £18,959.
The published figures as to profits and reserves of this
co. o.m be taken much too seriously. A gas co. may do
three tilings: (1) Out of profits it may writeoff or put
aside just enough to counterbalance rust and wear and
dry rot; or (2) it may not write off enough, in which
case it overstates its profits, and is eating up its capital;
or (3) it may stuff away profits which it doesn’t want a
watchful public to see, by the simple p.ocessof paying
for new mains, plant, etc., out of revenue, and including
the outlay among the working expenses. It takes a long
while before one can tell for certain which of the three
a co. is doing. If it doesn't put by enough, the time
will come when it will have a worn-out plant and
nothing in the till to buy a new one with. If, on the other
hanil, it stuffs away profits, the time will come when the
disguise breaks down of its own weight, whereupon the
co. usually parts with a sweet sorrow by watering its
capital. This paper doesn't know for sure which! lot this
co. belongs to ; but here is something to go on with :

First note that what is called the fixed investment
(mains, plant, etc.) stands in, the books at £73,827 less
than it did five years ago • in other words, besides paying
for all extensions, additions, repairs and renewals out of
revenue, the co. has written the properties down by
£73,827 —assuming it hasn’t sold them. Note next that
the sales are equal to 41 per cent, of the present book-
value of the plant, while 10 years ago they were under 29
per cent. This may mean that population is thicker,
or that people stay up later at nights, or use more gas
somehow ; but it also suggests that many profitable ex-
tensions and additions have been made which have not
been charged up to capital account at all. The profit per
cent, of sales has steadily fallen. This may mean higher cost
of production, though in Melbourne (where detailed
figures are published) the labor cost is lower than it was ; so
it is quite as likely to mean that nowadays the real profit
isn’t disclosed. Or it may be some of both. The co, still
has £307,550 of debentures, loans, etc.; and it looks pro-
bable that, unless a reduction in the price of gas arrives,
the co. will before very long relieve itself a little by calling-
up the other £50,000 on the last issue of £6 shares (now
£3 paid). New-issue shares, by the way, are worth about
£ll 10s. Add the £3 to be paid ; total, £l4 iOs. Assume
that they will carry the old 15 per cent., and that means
a return of £6 4s. per cent. Meantime, however, while
one is waiting for the £3 to be called up, one gets a
return of only 3J per cent.

That’s a surprising jump in profits, the result mainly of
largely increased sales at the same old high prices. But
this shows details better; the figures are as at June 30,
and the percentage increases are for 1909 over 1900 :

The only thing that hasn’t jumped worth mentioning is
the wage total; £11,894 spent on that item at the works
produced £249,341 of gas, coke, etc., while in 1900
£11,204 produced only £156,411. This, of course,
assumes that the gas, etc., sold in one half-year was pro-
duced in that term ; and gas, at anyrate, isn’t an article
that a co. can save up in large quantities. In June, 1900,
the expenditure on plant, mains, etc., on capital account
stood at £2,132,240 ; it is now £2,149,842. So except for
i. 17,602 all the plant, mains, etc., added during the
past nine years have been paid for out of profits ; and
what those additions have cost can be partly ascertained
from the first table above. Also the remarkable increase
in gas sales suggests that, besides costing a lot, the
additions are worth a lot. From the shareholders’point
of view the weakest feature is the existence of £798,000
of debentures, involving an annual interest charge
of £37,770. The bulk of these carry 5 per cent. ; but
as they mature in 1910-12, the co. will be able to make a
saving of £3OOO or £4OOO a year; and it would be a
mighty good plan if that amount were put aside as a
sinking (und to extinguish the debt by repurchase or
otherwise. Later on, the amount called for to pay for
new works is bound to ease off, because Australia can’t
expect to always have such good times as it has revelled
in lately, and part of that saving could be added to the
same fund. It is all very well for shareholders to flatter
themselves that they are earning d good deal more than
4 per cent, with the borrowed money which only costs
them 4 per cent.; but the time may come when this and
other gas cos. will bump against the competition of some
new' illuminant; and then they won’t feel so comfortable,
since the bill for debenture interest won’t be reduced at
all no matter how much the profits may be reduced.

Six months ago it was remarked here that, “ considering
the big increase in the amount put to reserve during the
past few years, something- might very reasonably be ex-
pected to happen before long”; and the “something”
is now announced in the shape of a new issue of shares.
At present the capital, authorised and issued, is only
£45,000, w'hich is remarkably little for the size of the
business. The profits shown above include the
net additions to reserves; these, in the past six-
months, included £BOO to formal reserve fund, £1350
to renewal reserve, and £25 to insurance fund.
The renewal reserve may not be a true reserve, and the
profits added thereto may not be true profits; it is
most likely a fund for the replacement of
plant, etc., already partly worn out. In June, 1905, after
the last little lot of capital was got in, the surplus of
liquid assets over liabilities was £23,131. Six months ago
it was £27,223. It is now £28,165. That means that
during the past four years all current repairs, renewals,
extensions of mains, etc., have been paid for, and, besides
keeping the 15 p.c, div. going, £5,034 has been accumu-
lated. Evidently the business can stand the something
previously mentioned; and quite likely Newcastle could
stand a reduction in its gas bills.

Usually this co. writes off something to cover depreci-
ation ; but having spent £122 on repairs and renewals—
about £lOO more than the average—and charged it to
working expenses, nothing is formally written off this
time, though £750 is transferred to a general renewal
fund. Probably some of this is really a depreciation
allow'ance, and ought to be deducted from profits. The
co., with a capital of £25,000, owes £1057 and has £358/
of liquid assets —a surplus of £2530. Five years ago it
had a surplus of £5lOO ; but it has put over £6OOO into
mains and services alone since then, and has brought up
its half-yearly gas revenue from £2293 to £3883, partly by
the purchase of a small suburban business. It is a pro-
gressive concern, and its profits are now well on the right
side of its dividend.

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving 1 waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a,
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Itecent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best soiid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. v\. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be

The Callow Revolving Band Screen gives
promise of revolutionising the system of ore classification
in Australia, as it has already done in America, for all
classes and conditions of concentrating ores, with vastly
improved extraction in the mills. At Broken Hill it has
been especially successful. It is an unqualified success as a
flue wet screen, and this is what all the mining world lias
been seeking; it is also equallv effective on the coarse rafts
from Cornish Rolls. With it there is no excessive wear, no
clogging of the mesh ; it has an enormous capacity and a
small water consumption. The fundamental principle of
this machine is a travelling band or belt of screen cloth
stretched on a drum over which the ore and its carrying
water is spread by means of a distributing apron of
special design. The drum passes over rollers and the
belt is caused to revolve continuously at a speed adapted
to the nature and quantity of the material to be screened.
Tile machine is fully protected l»y patent rights. For
further particulars apply to the Austral Otis Engineering
Co., of Hanna Street, South Melbourne. This firm are the

The keen competition of the present day makes
it imperative that the owner of mine, factory, or mill
shall keep his plant up-to-date in every particular. The
power question is one of first importance, and to large
power users the Korting 2-cycle gas engine, manufactured
by Mather and Platt, of Manchester, presents many
features of special significance. This engine, which is
similar in action to a steam engine, may be used with

Ten years before the above list opens the co. was paying
5 per cent. ; subsequently it paid 6 per cent. ; and the
table opens with the first 7 per cent. In 1900 .there was a
mortgage, the co. having used the money m the con-
struction of storage sheds, etc.; in the early pait of
1906 the last of the debt was wiped out, where-
upon the div. was put up. In the next year
Princes Wharf was bought, and on June 30, 19lh,
there was a mortgage on that account of *lO 000 At
that date liabilities were £10,208 ; liquid assets, i3.)B—
the past two years such progress has been made that the
liabilities are now only £2535, and the liquid assets £2035.
What may be called the cash position has thus been lm-
proved by £5726 in two years. Repairs and maintenance
are charged direct to profit and loss; in the past six
months this account has also been debited with the cost
of deepening, which explains some, though not all, of the
falling-away in profit. Apart from tins it is not clear that
anything is written off to cover general depreciation, if
any The co. has had a highly profitable tune during the
last" few years; before that, however, returns were rather '
erratic, and they are likely to be more or less so in the
future, because S. Australian prosperity depends to such
a large extent on the uncertain seasons. The co. is now,
however, in an excellent position to face any tempoiary
trouble. The co. is in 20,0U0 shares of £5 each, but 4686 of
them are unissued.

Of the reserves £l5OO is a renewal fund; this is most
likely a set-off against actual depreciation, in which case
it isn’t a true reserve. Also, of course, the true
profits in that case are less than the table shows.
There is a mortgage of £lO,OOO, and no attempt
is being made.to reduce it. While this debt exists it lias
the same effect as an issue of cumulative pref. shares. In
ordinary times it is pleasant enough to have the use of
somebody else’s money at a cheap rate ; but when times
are bad it is liable to become awkward. And this co is
pretty certain to have its good times and its had times,
because the lead market is about as uneven as a camel’s
back. Also a time will come when there won’t he much
to shift from Broken Hill except holes and skinny rabbits,
and neither will pav to export; consequently some of the
dividends which this co. has been paying during the
recent fat time ought to be regarded by the investor as
return of capital. If he regards them all as dividend, and
buys shares on that basis, he is liable to feel sorry for
himself late* on. Still there is almost bound to be a
good many years of prosperity ahead of this co.,
in consequence partly of the large quantities of zinc con-
centrates which will be shipped so long as the spelter
market stands even moderately well on its feet. But
while the enticing returns are flowing in, it will be just
as well to remember four things : (1) the mortgage; (2)
the erratic metal markets; (3) the fact that the Barrier
is rapidly becoming more-hole than mine ; (4) the absence
of any cash reserve to make renewals, etc., which means
that when they become necessary they will have to be
paid for either out of the profits at the time or out of
money raised bv mortgaging future profits.

This co. has a mysterious “ special reserve ” which comes
and goes without explanation ; it was £3400 six months
ago, and now it is only £4BB. Probably it has something
to do with the operations of the Llthgow Uoai Associ-
ation, a handy little combine (or something such) of
Western coal-owners which to a great extent fixes out-
puts and prices. Disregarding the special reserve the

But if anybody declines to take these remarkably uniform
figures seriously, The Bulletin has no authority to fine
him even tuppence. The fact, no doubt, is that, when
profits look too high the management chops off a bit and
uses the fragment for writing-down purposes. Hence
some of these movements in the book value of the

Thus in three years mine property has been written down
£3082 plus anything spent on purchases meantime ; and
other items have also been written down. In this way
■the co. is very properly accumulating liquid assets to
take the place of the disappearing mine. The co. is now
•over 36 years old ; but for many years it did poorly, like
most Western collieries. Dividends ranged at that time
.from 5 per cent, to nil, though mostly they were 5 per
cent. Then the throat-cutting was stopped; at least,
the association was formed to keep its own throat uncut,
though what may happen to an outside competitor is
another matter. Since then profits have been distinctly
good—better, very likely, than have been shown, judging
by t.he se-vere writing down —but the future hangs, to a
very great extent, on the maintenance of these recent
conditions.

This 30-vear-old co., in which lords and viscounts are
conspicuous shareholders (ex-Governor Hampden was for
some years chairman), has had a long and profitable
career. Even in the’nineties, when most mori gage cos.
were busy repairing the rents in their clothes, and heal-
ing the torn places in themselves underneath the rents,
this co. kept up a 5 percent, div. throughout. With £8
still uncalled on the 100,000 shares (£2 paid), the lords and
viscounts haven’t had much difficulty in persuading them-
selves that a strong reserve fund is desirable ; and over
£BO,OOO has been added during the past five years. Yet
nothing less than that was c died for, because of the very-
great increase of the money at risk :

In 1903 for every £1 of shareholders’ funds there was
£2 3s. 9d. at risk ; in 1908 there was £3 6s. 6d. Some of
last year’s advances —on wool, etc. —were no doubt only
temporary, the increase being due to growers holding off
and waiting for the better market which, as it happened,
arrived ; but even apart from that there have been large
movements. Moreover, those large movements have
occurred at a time of inflated values when the mortgage
business is the most risky. When the year closed the total
liabilities were £1,027.624, so the co. had almost exactly
£3 of the public’s money for every £1 of its own ; and in
view of the nature of the business, that is quite enough.
Considering the growth of the risks and of the reserves,
profits have not increased as they should have done ; so,
altogether, the request made at the shareholders’meeting
for bigger dividends was singularly inopportune.

In spite of a sickly metal market, attempts are
still being made in Broken Hill to refloat old “shows”
which were found too leaky to keep on the surface even
in boom times. Besides the Silver City Blocks and the
North Broken Hill Blocks—shows which have little to
offer the investor but a shallow hole to bury his faith in
the old Golden King is up again. The extraordinary
thing is that all these tinpot shows can command glowing
expert reports. On the surface these reports appear to
state that the claim is all the vendors say it is; but,
boiled down, all they amount to is this “There is little
or no ore in sight, but if you dig deep enough, and
explore wide enough, you might get some.”
■*’*•**
After turning over half a dozen processes in its
mind, British Broken Hill has decided to put in an
Elmore zinc concentrating plant. Most of the money will
come from the sale of one heap of tailings to the Zinc
Corporation, which uses the same process.

The resurrected Gibraltar Consolidated, Ade-
long (N.S.W.). has crushed 395 tons for £2850. of which
£ll5O is reckoned profit. Th claim has been doing well
lately ; but, taking the estimated profit as a guide, costs
are something like £3 per ton. Looked at that way,
there isn’t any call to get excited over the Gibraltar:
for stone that can stand £3 a ton isn’t likely to last long
or be extensive. Already, in fact, the two northern
drives are on poorer and smaller stone, and the outlook
isn’t brilliant.

Budgerygar, Cobar district (N.S.W.), issues a
circular in which shareholders are told with brutal frank-
ness that, if they don’t take up some new shares, they
will be knocked'on the head. The co. offered these new
shares; but they were not all taken. Now, therefore,
this circular is issued remarking icily that, if you, dear
sir, don’t take up enough shares, “ the directors have
decided to convene a special meeting to sanction the sale
to another co. to consist of all those who have applied for
new shares. In the event of such sale the purchase
money will be equal to the liabilities This really
means that if you fail to amply for such number of new
shares as are available for you, the whole of your interest
in the mine wiU b j come forfeited.”' If the new co. is
formed, what about calling it the Bail-up?

“M.C.” : Lithgow (N.S.W.) has its iron furnace
blown in again. The Government testing shop is close to
the works, and the officials are ready to give the trade or
the public any information about the quality of the pig
produced. A train-load of about 209 tons of ore arrives
daily, so if the furnace can turn out 500 or 600 tons of pig
per week there is no need for a scare about the quality of
the ore. There is probably better ore in a dozen different
places, but an extra 10 units of iron (worth 3s. or 45.) will
not counterbalance the cost of assembling coal, lime-
stone, etc., over long distances. Both Britain and Ger-
many’ handle enormous quantities of ,ironstone, worth
onlv from 20 to 30 per cent. Sandford, who was the
father of Lithgow iron, knew quite well that a big con-
tinent like Austr dia requires more than one blast furnace
because of the expense of distributing pig iron oyer long
railway lines ; but, he recognised in Lithgow a distribut-
ing centre unusually well situated among railway lines,
and therefore a good place at which to make a start.

The co. used to have a paid capital of £11,500; but it is
now £12,500. The original vendors got £5OOO in shares
and £lOOO in cash, so the mine lias already given back a
lot more than was put into it, and there was over £2200
in cash and metal in hand on June 30. Theco. has to
pick its ground, and is always keeping its eye open for
likelv-looking spots in its neighborhood. So far, want of
water has troubled it more than want of tin.

The Oroya-Black Range “investigation” was
alluded to at the Orova-Brovvn Hill meeting, and the
announcement was made that, 8., M. & Co. had emerged
with flying colors. Certain insinuations had been made,
and a committee of inquiry was appointed at the last
meeting of the former co. to look into things. One of
the indictments filed against the firm was as to the
amount of commission received on account of the sale of
the property. The committee found that what was paid
to the firm, as compared with what its energy and enter-
prise had earned for the co., was microscopic. It also
transpired that 8., M. & Co. acquired the Orova-Black
Range on its own account, but instead of passing the
property on and pocketing a magnificent profit, it handed
the whole concern over to the Oroya-Brown Hill, not for
a price down, hut for a small commission on the profit, it
might bring the co. Someone suggested that the Orova-
Brown Hill Board should give the firm a handsome
honorarium for the trouble it had been put to in regard
to the inquiry ; but Algernon Mnreing, who stood up
after the other fellow had sat down, said with some show
of dignity that the firm was perfectly satisfied with the
way in which it had been treated by the Board, and
desired nothing further.

The luck of the Western district (Vic.) doesn’t
look like sticking to the Black Range Kohinoor, an off-
shoot of lians Irvine’s Black Range (W.A.). Values in
the district always h ive been erratic, and the reef in this
claim is as erratic as the values. “In conclusion,”
says manager Couper, “ I regret I am unable to
congratulate shareholders on the success of the develop-
ment work or the appearance of the mine generally,” and
Hans Irvine says ditto. Si ill the co. stands on velvet. It
put up no money ; initial exes, were met by an advance
from the Black Range Co., which has been paid back out
of gold won, and after paying all debts there is still ±5OO
in hand. The richer patches are paying for prospecting
the mine deeper, and are likely to keep the pot boiling for
some time to come.

Somebody talked too soon about the Hannan’s
Star, Deep Levels, and Ch tiers (W.A.) amalgamation.
There have, it is announced, been “ no official negotia-
tions.” There never are in a case of this sort. They are
mu ftieial until a working agreement is arrived at ; and
then the formal business starts. But in this case it isn t
yet certain that matters will go so far, though there are
29 (or so) good reasons why they should.
Orion (W. A.), is stuck for cash, and is having a
try to get it by creating 100,000 new shares. Of these
50,000 are being offered to shareholders at 2s. each, and a
12 months’option is given over a similar number at the
same price. By this means the co. hopes to get £5OOO to
go on with and a like amount a year hence. As an extra
inducement, it is stipulated that the proceeds are to be
used for seti ling old scores, purchasing new plant, etc.,
and not for wiping off arrears in directors’ fees or office
expenses. But on present appearances the concern is
never likely to provide more than a living for the officials,
and to do even that it will most likely want a little
“encouragement” from shareholders every now and
then.

Chairman West Ridgeway told shareholders at
the Boulder Perseverance meeting that the drop in the
estimated value of the ore reserves was principally due to
the gn de of the ore developed during 1908 not being
equal to that, previously treated. He spyke encouragingly
about new finds, the occurrence of which, he said, justi-
fied the present development expenditure of close on
£5OOO a month. Beyond these few remarks and the
statement that in four years the ore in sight had been
increased from 338,000 tons to 000,000 tons, Ridgeway
didn’t say am thing worth noting.
*' # * *
Thk Bulletin said, two or three times that the
Sons of Uwuli (W.A.) was being worked below its
capacity, and the fact of the Board having hrst
increased the output to £20,500, and now to £22,000,
supports that view. Present distributions amount
to 3s. per year; but as the profit now being earned
is sufficient to pav 4s. and leave a hit over, it is
probable that the latter sum will be paid from this out,
ami he continued while the return is maintained at the
present figure. That ougfit to be at least two years, and
probably longer.
Cue Consolidated Finance Co. (W.A.), which
for years has carried on a financial busiru ss of pn fit to
officials and loss to shareholders, has just issued another
statement,of accounts. This shows the revenue for 1908
to he £lOl, and the expenditure (almost wholly fees
salaries, rent and postage) 4.946. When the year ended
the co. estimated its cash assets at £11,669, so that those
who are dependent on it for a living have still something
to lo k forward to. The outlook for shareholders, though,
is dismal.
Gold has been found at Tanami. in the Far
North-West. Though the field—if there is a field—is 90
miles inside the Northern Territory, the host route at pre-
sent is through W. stralia. Later on, however, the shortest
trip will be from Port Darwin, thence by the mail-boat to
the Victoria River. Though the public has only heard of it
during the last fortnight, it isn’t exactly a new linn.
Tetnby, a well-known prospector, formed a syndicate in
Melbourne and Sydney some months .".go ; hut a private
partv made what appears to he the most important hna
so far ' the Tanami syndicate has to be content with a
claim next door. The country is apparently men more
difficult to tret at than Kimberley was, and only well-
equipped parties should attempt it. The Port Darwin-
Victoria River route is practically not passable except in
the wet season, which usually starts about November.

Mills’United, Charters Towers, crushed 1396
toils for £6601. There are brighter hopes for No. 13 level ;
and that probably accounts for the firmer market. New
Brilliant. Freehold will probably benefit if a good shoot of
stone is discovered in Mills’ Foiled deep levels ; and the
Brilliant Block, which is down 190 ft., will also feel
better. The fact that reefs in ihe Day Dawn hanging
wall country are continuing eastwards has helped the
market more than anvt hing else. With so much de\ elop-
ment work going on, the various reefs require naming or
numbering for identification. The reef off No. 2 cross-
cut is beiny driven east on better stone than that sltow-
iny in the western end. Brilliant Blocks hope to strike
one of these hanyiny wall formations from the N.8.1*.
within the next 50ft. The leader passed-through some
time since is mineralised, and will he driven on when
sinkiny is discontinued. The slide met with in the Last
Mexican’sB3oft. level is striking N.E. and S.W., and the
reef is not yet free from this disturbance ; aciosscut was
recently started to find the true footwall.

Mount Oxide is on the north-westerly extremity
of Cloncurry (O.). Burketowu, on the Gulf, is the nearest
port - but teams are now taking: 30 per cent, picked ore
into Normanton. This mine has.been developed from an
open cut on the crown of a hill, and the workings are still
shallow (70ft. vertical). The formation is large and carries
seams of rich ylance and oxides, assaying up to 50 per
cent. Riyht through the Cloncurry field rich ore is al-
most invariably associated with calcite or lime, which
favors the precipitation of copper in a zone of secondary
enrichment. The copper has been practically leached
and re-deposited. Thus the rich ore now being turned in
the Duchess (Hampden-Cloncurry) is interlaced in a cal-
cite formation. At the Great Australia a big, low-grade
calcite formation as also cut into at 300 ft. vertical. In
some instances —notably the Granby (British Columbia)—
lime, iron and silica are so evenly balanced that the ore is
self-fluxing ', hut, generally speaking, Cloncurry mines
show a deficiency of sulphur and iron, though that is
likely to change with depth if the bodies live down.

The Dawson coalfield (Q.) is to have its railway,
unless some accident happens. The line will he an extern
sion of the one that goes to Mount Morgan, and the survey
t ikes It along the hank of the Dee, then on to the Pnune,
Krooni bit, and Callide Creek, a total of 69 miles. There
is some .mod country around it, more particularly tne
Prairie. Both Morgan and Fitzrov have been large im-
porters of German coke, so they ought to welcome a rail-
way connecting them with large seams of anthracite
coal. Blair Athol is also coming forward again as a coal
field ; a short line would connect the mines with the
Clermont railway. # m
To pay adiv. of fid. per month on the increased
capital of £72,000, Lord Nelson, Sr. Arnaud (Vic.), has to
make £lBOO. What are the prospects? In the last six
months sldwt. per ton was averaged for 15,000 tons.
What came from cyanide did not count much, revealing
the weakest spot in the course of treatment. It would be
worth knowing what the Nelson stone averages before it
o-oes to the mill, and what is obtained from cyamding.
This data given, with a statement of costs of the re-pect-
ive operations two palpable gaps in the reports would
vanish. As St. Arnaud gold is worth about, £3 125.,
values could he stated in coin of the realm. Also they
might tell what stone is available in the stopes, or proved.
It is a fool’s game to buy shares without data of that, kind
available. What is asserted for the Nelson is (1) that
stone has improved in the bottom level, (2) that it
is lengthening to the north, and (3) that there are
indications of greater length and more mineral
at greater depth. “ Indications” can be left to take care
of themselves. If a girl smiles at a man, it doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that he may hug: her. Mineral, again, doesn t
always mean more gold, especially when a mine is start-
ing* «»ut on a new career at 2000 ft. Therefore, it looks as
if the mine is living* a bit on expectations and the doings
of the past; and on the hope that testing of parallel reefs
will bring reward. Anyone who doesn’t like these con-
clusions is invited to fire out figures as to reserves and ai
to the sampling of the reef at the bottom level, together
with costs and recoveries and value of mine products.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ _ Stdnkt, August 2, 1909.
My Dear Arint,—
The Earl of Chesterfield, whose historic resi-
dence has just been acquired by the Tooths, of
this State, is directly descended from the Lord
Chesterfield whose elaborateness of manner has
overshadowed the facts that he was a British
Cabinet Minister, a K.G., an ambassador to
Holland, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It is
passing strange that the Chesterfield nobleman
should have to sell Holme Lacy, as his wife is
one of the Wilsons of Tran by Croft (where the
present King played baccarat in the long ago), and
the Wilson family tears large dividends annually
from a shipping business at Hull. Possibly the
circumstance that the Earl has for years been a
prominent member of the Cold Land racing set
has something to do with the sale. Slow horses
are prime influences in the transferences of great
properties to the caste of Beer de Beer.
Miss Victoria Wyatt Eawson, a daughter of
la.te Commander Wyatt Eawson, E.N., and a
niece of our late Governor of that name, was mar-
ried with much pomp and panoply at Westbourne
(which is somewhere in England), last month, to
Commander Larken, of H.M.S. Bellerophon. Our
Sir Harry was amongst the present-givers with a
cheque, and Miss Alice Rawson rose to the
occasion with a butter-dish. The Wilders, whose
sensational appearance in Sydney is still remem-
bered, are chronicled as presenters of silver
candlesticks.
Which reminds me that Mrs. Wilder’s portrait
looks over her own shoulder from the front
page of the Court .Journal for last month. She
stands robed in lace and draped with a long
ermine cloak. A huge hound muses by her side,
and the lordly architecture of the background
suggests the environment of the Wilder country
seat, Stanstead Park, in Sussex; or maybe it was
the cardboard battlements of a photographic
studio.
There is a loud buzzing (in Sydney societv) as
of ten swarms of bees that have found a honey-
suckle hedge in full bloom. The reported engage-
ment of Mrs. “Havilah” White, the ownerof
Beulah Flats, is the cause. Lord Frederick Fitz-
Gerald, a brother of the fifth Duke of Leinster
and uncle of the present youthful (sixth) duke, is
said to be the appropriator of the tall, blonde
widow. Mrs. White has a daughter married, but
her latest lamb is a pretty youngster of barely
seven. Lord Frederick, of the old nobility of the
Geraldines who raged in Ireland from the early
part of the thirteenth century, is a soldier, and
has served in Afghanistan, South Africa and
Egypt. He is 52 years young. A brother of
his, Lord Charles FitzG., lives near Mel-
bourne, and was married to an Australian-
born girl, a daughter of one Pericles Claudius.
Mrs. White met the Leinster clan through
chaperoning a daughter of the Charles FitzGeralds
to Europe last year. It may interest other smart
Sydney widows to know that the bride-groom-
elect has an unmarried brother a year or so
younger than himself.
Of all the strangers within our gates Mr. Charles
Heidsieck, of the famous champ 'gne clan, is caus-
ing the widest ripples in the society pond. The
girls aren’t finding any fault with his looks or his
tailoring, and as he is still young enough to grow
enthusiastic over the mere mention of dancing, they
probably won’t find him walking over their feet
when he is their partner in the waltz or the
two-step. He says, by the way, that in the
pleasant land of France they have not danced a
waltz for seven or eight years. The “Boston”
has taken its place. “You count one, two,
three, four, five, six. The' long slow accent, so to
speak, is on the second and fifth steps.” The affable
stranger was amazed to see in this allegedly sun-
burnt land such perfect skaters as he saw at the
Sydney Glaciarium. And as to Australian Lock-
ing—well, when he got as far as Perth he mur-
mured that Paris fashion creators had little to
teach the women of the western capital, and
when he got to Sydney he was not sure that
Sydney could not tell Paris something on
the gospel of clothes. If the gallant French-
man really does think these things, what
will he say of us when he sees us at
the Spring races at Hand wick, and at the Cup at
Flemington. These are the occasions when the
Commonwealth woman rivals the galah, the
macaw and the orchid. He will be too dazzled
to see his way back to Eheims. Eheims is
the only place on the planet where the grape
with the requisite flavor for the Heidsieck

Mr. “Shakspeare” Bentley is employing these
days at the head anci front of August in rehearsing
a company in “ Hamlet,” and the Prince of Den-
mark, with all his super-manly wisdom, even to

A great shuddering joy taps every knob of one’s
spine and thrills the spinal marrow when pictures
of winter on Monaro and winter sports at
Kosciusko are filmed for one’s delectation. The
other night, after hearing Mr. Percy Hunter
lecture on Alpine Sport at Kosciusko, and seeing
the snow and ice pictures, I went home and read
large areas of the Book of Job. There is such a lot of
weather—cold weather especially—in that Book.
I m sure that Job, before he sat in the dust-box
and argued with Bildad theShwhite, used to wear
flannel next the skin, and go tobogganing, and
get giddy at snow carnivals. “ Hast thou entered
into the treasures of the snow?” asks the Lord,
out of the whirlwind. “By the breath of God
frost is given and the breadth of the waters is
straitened. lhat makes for ice skating. And
somewhere else is asked : “ Who can stand before
His cold?” Pictures of women tourists at the
Kosciusko Hotel show them clad in short skirts,
sweaters, motor caps and sum-boots. They are
ski-ing (which it appears you must pronounce
shoeing” or be left out to perish in the drifts)
or skating on the frozen lake. Great bait for
tourists is this cold heaven-kissing land. On the
11th and 12th of this month a carnival will be
held in the Snow White Land around the hotel.
Artist Brunton probably didn’t even know that
he had heart trouble, or he would surelv not have
died intestate. He had banked some £9OO, and
only* f ew days previously Mrs. Brunton put in
all the savings of their youthful daughter. Her
husband used to say, “As soon as there’s £lOOO
111 make it over to you.” Then, without warn*
ing, his soul was required of him. It may be two
years before the widow can touch a shilling of the
money she had helped her husband to save. Then
she will only share in it. The children of Brunton’s
tifst wife are married, and are somewhere in Eng-
land. Their whereabouts will have to be ascer-
tained, and the expenses will gnaw into the little
capital. A benefit matinee for Airs. Brunton will
be given at the 1 heatre Iloyal on Thursday after-
110<cn n £C lls t 12. A splendid programme is
to fill the crowded hours. Kingston and Ethel
Warwick will do the balcony scene from “ Romeo
and Juliet. ’ Walter Bentley will be Richard
Duke of Gloucester when he'woos Lady Anne •
George Rignold will recite: the Bland Holt Co.
will help; and Rickards and West’s Pictures will be
to the fore. In fact, nearly all the theatrical pro-
fession is willing to do something. There never
were more wiliing-willed helpers.

“Anatomy In Its Application to Art” is the
shapely title given to a course of 12 Wednesday
evening lectures, the first of which was delivered
in the Department of Anatomy at Sydney Uni-
versity on August 4. The lecturer is t)r. Smith
a skilled anatomist and a brother of Prof. Grafton
Smith, who was recently appointed Professor of
Anatomy at Manchester University. (Grafton
Smith had previously distinguished himself at
Cairo, at which place he “ researched ” the skulls
of numerous dead and uirtidv Egyptians, who left
their bones lying round loose after they had
finished with them.) Dr. Smith’s lectures are in-
tended for art students and artists—but more
particularly for those engaged in teaching. The
very moderate fee for the complete course is 10s.,
and the whole resources of the Anatomical School
are at the lecturer’s disposal. Those black-ami-
white Australians who will persist in sending
Ihe Bulletin drawings of bushmen whose arms
reach to the horizon, might please take notice. If
Dr Smith can straighten out their ideas of their
fellow-nmn this paper will be obliged to him.

“ Well, what did Mrs. Christian say to your
getting married? That was the greeting with
which one feminine met Miss Kate Rooney. To
some of the eternal feminine the singer of songs
was more interesting as a happy Mrs. than as a
successful warbler. The contralto looks as healthy
successful persons usually appear. She has the air
of one who has achieved. London is good to
her, as it is to most other Australians who have
something worth its market, and who can tide
over the submerging time. “All the Aus-
tralians I know are doing well,” she savs
Carrie Lancely, Violet Ludlow, Violet Mount,
Alice Hollander—all doing splendidly. And does
Sydney remember Amy Simpson ? She left here
abouta year before I did. She has been for years a
great success, and has kept her pretty looks, and
makes plenty of money. Sylvia Blackstone has a
good society connection ; and as to Walter Kirby—
he is the pet of princesses in London and Rome,
and quite a wealthy man. He won’t listen to
anything under fifty guineas an appearance. He
sings like a tenor angel—no, he doesn’t attempt
opera.. . . There is such space there in the muddv
sleety capital for the artiste. Think—an average
of about 30 concerts on a Sunday, with some eight
artists and a band at each. In London, in mv
submerged days, I sung but once for a nharitv
and that was for the Hospice for the Dying.” The
melodious Returned starts her season at the Town

Mr H. N. Southwell, pilot-fish for Melba, re-
turned to Sydney last week, and will leave agfain
aliout the of this week for the South
bouthies experiences in North Queensland
have staggered his loyalty to all other parts of the
Commonwealth. The people and the natural
beauties of those parts, he reckons, are un-
equalled.
Greder, the soulful-eyed German who was left
on these shores by Musgrove’s wildly disorganised
German Opera Co departed by the Mamina last
week, taking with him some girl voices to be
polished at Berlin. Greder, who for a German
has more than his share of enthusiasm, promises
the girls lyric crowns. A crown of thorns is
oftener the lot of the artiste who wanders hence
in search of the other sort.
The greatest compliment England can pay
a visitor is to feed him at great length. Deakin,
of the Fused Ministry, was fed ; the press dele-
gates were fed ; and now Shackleton is having
nourishment forced upon him. The custom of
stuffing and otherwise ill-treating the digestion
has become so general that the Englishman him-
self is starting to make jocular references to it like
this:—
Lord Halsbury said they must all congratulate Mr.
Shackleton on the perils which he had escaped ; but it
was not certain that he ought not to be warned of the
perils which were in store for him. (Laughter.) It was
not probable that he would suffer from starvation.
And above the clashing of the knives and forks,
the voice of the cable shrieks that, in consequence
of six firms in the Chicago Meat Trust having
raised the price of meat some more, lamb
chops are now selling in London at Is. s£d.
per lb. Meat of any sort is now right
out of reach of an immense number of Eng-
lishmen, and the roast beef of that country is
to millions a mere faded memory. In other and
better fed days it was the custom of nations to
honor visitors with presents of gems, gold, silver,
i vory and other rare and costly truck; to-day
England hands the distinguished, stranger a plate
of food, and jokes ponderously about it, whilst
the national skeletons r ittle horribly in the wind.
Food is now about the rarest and most precious
thing on the premises of Bull, and if the stranger
doesn’t look impressed or grateful when the
waiter sidles in, then there is nothing more to be
done for him.
From a kindly Cobar correspondent, signing
“ M. McLean,” I have got a pound for the Hospice
for the Dying. The donor is hereby thanked.
Mention of this charity reminds that of the 200 or
300 persons who bought gallery tickets for
the ball and failed to get admission, only one
person (a man—a Somebody in his line, too)
asked for a refund of his money. The fact speaks
well for the generosity of the shunted ones.
Yours affectionately,
AENEHI.
Sydney Telegraph cries aloud that the “great
producing industries” demand more railways.
Seeing that, in proportion to population, Aus-
tralia has already more rail ways than any other
country on earth, the question arises whether the
Telegraph’s concern is for the “great producing
industries ’’ or for the great land-owners. At any
rate, if the Telegraph really wants to serve the
* great producing industries,” it will have to tack
something on to its railway proposals. For
instance, the N.S. W. Government recently built
a line running out from 'femora towards Bareli an ;
and the Town and Country Journal, which has
had a reporter out that way writing up the
country, chortles over the fact that mixed
wheat and grazing land, which three or four
years ago could be had for 15s. per acre, has now
been forced up to £3 or £4. It is admitted that
the increase of value has been due to railway ex-
tension—in other words, to the spending of public
money, or of borrowed money which the public
will some day have to repay—yet it isn’t the
public, but the big land-shark, that gets this in-
creased value. If the public got it, the Railway
Department could set it off against the cost of the
line, and thus reduce the charges for carrying the
farmer’s produce. As it is. the farmer has
to pay a high price for the land and a
high rate for carriage ; and he will go on paying
it so long as the private landlord scoops in
the increment that follows from the expendi-
ture of public money. A betterment-tax
ought to be tine of the easiest in the world to
assess and collect; yet the only attempt in that
direction in N.S.W. has been a rank failure—
probably because it was intended to be—and
therefore all along the Act has been treated as so
much waste paper. But. after all. the great mis-
take lies in the insufficient width of railway
lines. Land for a country railway is resumed to a
width of two or three chains, whereas it ought to
be resumed to a width of 20 or 30 miles—more in
some cases.
«.
’Jh T DGE Rogers, of N.S.W., made use of the
judicial Bench last week as an eminence from
which to fling a srone at the Commonwealth. It
was in connection with the trial of a dishonest
postal official, whose salary, after 20 years’ ser-
vice, amounted to a ve y miserable and inade-
quate £126. With a wife and four children to
keep, this man of 30-odd years had a fairly hard
financial problem to solve; but he might have
managed it save for a disastrous interest in a
racing pony. The animal was not even fast
enough to gallop into court so the learned but
impulsive Judge was not officially aware of its
existence when he fired off this gibe
He had no sympathy with Governments which under-
paid their servants, and especially had he no sympathy
with the Commonwealth Government whatever.’ People
talked a great deal about what wonderful things were
to be wrought under Federation. If this was the way
the servants of the Commonwealth were to be treated
then it was a poor change.
The next day Johnson, of N.S.W., arose in the
House of Representatives in search of an explana-
tion. He.got it promptly, as follows, from John
Quick, Fused Postmaster-General:—
When taken over by the Commonwealth Selby was 27
years of age, and received £BO per annum; but he had
been in receipt of £126 per annum since December 1 last,
and consequently he had had an increase of more than
50 per cent, in his salary since he had been under the
control of the Federal Government. His transfer to
Cobar as clerical assistant, at£l4o a year, with a district
allowance, was approved ; but did not take place owing
to his irregularities with Government monev coming to
light, leading to his prosecution and dismissal. Though
the matter could not be introduced as evidence, the
acting-inspector ascertained that Selby was the owner of
or had a considerable interest in, a racing ponv, and that
his difficulties were due to outside influences, rather than
to his office duties.
The real position seems to be that, when the
Commonwealth took over the Post Offices, it also
became boss of at least one semi-slave. It did its
best, with the very inadequate means at its dis-
posal after it had tried to satisfy the clamorous
State Treasurers, to improve its sweated servant’s
lot, and succeeded in doing at least 57J per cent,
better than the State had done. Therefore,
Mr. Rogers’ remarks seem stupider and more
venomous and parish-minded than they need have
been.

The Victorian Government has an idea that it
ought to abolish the present iniquitous municipal
subsidy and find, or provide, or borrow, £200,000
a year for a Main Roads Board to spend in
putting and keeping the Victorian tracks in order.
Ihe work wants doing badly enough, but—whato
are the councils for? Apparently no steps are to
be taken to ensure the remainder of their work
being done any better, or to see that they acquire
sufficient honesty to tax themselves adequately, or
to overcome their present habit of wailing dis-
consolately on the Treasury steps every time a
flood carries away a culvert or a drought cracks a
drain pipe. Swindling councils are, it seems, to
be allowed to go on levying rates equal to
about 3d. in the £l, instead of being forced
to tax themselves up to the 2s. 4d. of Brunswick
or the 2s. 6d. of Footscray. The details of the
Main. Roads Board scheme have not been settled
finally, but the idea of Cameron, the Acting
Minister for Works, is that the Councils should
draw up plans and specifications, and call for
tenders, and supervise the works, while the
Board should find the money. Moreover, he
reckons that the coin should be allocated, not
where it may happen to be most needed, but in
accordance with existing classifications; which
means that the rich but shamefully undervalued
Western Shires, where often 30 miles of “main”
road connect two squatters, are to get a large
slice of the Main Road vote, while heavily-rated
Footscray, with miles of streets yet to be rescued
from the bog, and with two main arteries running
through it, will get nothing. It is a great scheme,
and if it doesn’t tickle the Fat Landlords nothing
on earth will.

The ancient and gigantic firm of Anthony
Hordern and Sons, of the Palace Emporium,
Brickfield Hill, does not very often indulge in a
sale; but when it does, prices collapse like a
house of cards. The annual sale is now raging,
and will continue to do so till Saturday, August
21. Although everything in the whole vast build-
ing is reduced, the fall in calico is the greatest,
and beats the original Fall of Man hollow.
It happened this way. A month ago
the London buyer cabled that prices
were likely to rise, and was instructed
to take off his coat and wade right in. He bought
£30,000 worth in one gigantic sweep, receiving
enormous discounts on so large a quantity. Now
it is cabled that cottons have soared up in price,
and the customers of the Palace Emporium stand
on velvet, receiving reductions which represent
not only the recent rise but also the saving
effected by the placing of so large an order at the
low prices previously prevailing.

THE CHOICEST
Of ALL GIFTS.
FOR THE WIFE—
The Pianola Piano gives the wife the pleasure of renewing her acquaintance with the
pieces she “ used to play,” and also of performing many compositions that were beyond
her ability, even when her technique was at its best.
FOR THE DAUGHTERS—
If there are daughters in the family who are taking music lessons, the Pianola Piano
supplies the requirements of hand-playing just as successfully as though the Pianola were
not built into it.
FOR THE SONS—
The Pianola Piano provides a new and powerful interest in the home. Evenings which
might otherwise be less profitably spent will be occupied in playing over the latest and
brightest of the current music—the light opera hits and the newest dance music.
FOR THE CHILDREN—
A real educational force can easily be made of the Pianola Piano. Children can be g.ven
a taste for the best composers, and a broad familiarity with the great art of music that
will be of value to them all their lives.
FOR THE MAN—
A man who m vv not know one note from another suddenly finds himself endowed with
the ability to pity anything and everything in the whole wonder-world of .music.
There is rest for tired nerves in playing for YOURSELF whatever class of music
your tastes dictate.
DO NOT CONFUSE THE PIANOLA PIANO
WITH ITS IMITATORS.
It is most important to the purchaser to realise that the Pianola and Pianola Piano are
not terms applying to piano-playing instruments in general.
Only the Pianola Co. makes the Genuine Pianola.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, August 2, 1909.
Mr Dear Yarrtk,—
Listen ! Not too loud ! Governor Carmichael
wears nighties! Anyhow, if he is converted to
pyjamas, the change is of a few weeks’ recency',
for a charity home came in for a haul of discarded
night gear. In a parcel from Government
House were two dozen nightshirts in excellent
repair. The home shelters hoys of a tender age,
and .the nighties were all of Governor size ; so two
dozen poor little Oliver Twists flap ghostly long
arms round the dormitories when the warden is
out of hearing. And the other boys find some
vent for their envy in snorting at the favored ones
and deriding them as “ hexellencies.”
There have been great doings at Dillalah
Station, in Queensland, where several Governors
have had a gorgeous duck-shoot, and bagged 500
of the poor creatures. Dillalah is owned by Dame
Peterson. She lives mostly at East St. Kilda,
and her pet hobbies are nursing stray mongrels
back to a dog’s life, and inveighing against
fashionable Melbourne’s use of bearing reins.
Altogether, a good-hearted soul is Mrs. Peterson.
The station is managed by Duncan Love, whose
lady is a very queen of curds and cream, and one
of the best of amateur cooks, if there are such
people as amateur cooks.
News comes from Foggy lands of the young
dame who used to be Tryphena, with rubies
in the embroideries of her frock and pink
tulle lining the glories of a silver court train,
doing difficult acrobatics before the Queen. The
Countess of Jersey stood sponsor for the presents
ton. Later, the Buckingham’s Gate dwelling of
the presented one was resplendent for a huge
reception given in honor of sister .Mrs. Reed, from
Australia. The town roost was glorified by floral
vegetables from the conservatories of the Grimsby
country seat.
The Rupert Clarke divorce affair reaches the
public as little more than a ghostly flag-flapping.
The public sees a fashionable woman hurrying in
a hunted way out of her motor car and through
crowds to a shop or a solicitor's office, with her
new bride-daughter trailing like a miserable
shadow at her elbow. Also there is the ghostly
smoke of a departing steamer drooping on the
horizon, and the public is done out of its gloat.
The case will not be defended, but the solicitors
have heaped up facts and a corresponding heap
of gold. These two heaps balance well.
The Hugo Wertiieims are among the latest
gadders. They left for Europe by the Makura.
going from Sydney via Canada, and they won’t
be back till next year, the gods and the weather
permitting.
It is most unreasonable of people to have names
that have the same sound in one’s mind—even if,
phonetically, they are different. There is a
strong synonym in Smith and Jones—though they
are speit differently. Wonder if it was the
printer's error last week when Johanna mated
Mrs. George Robertson, iiistead of Mrs. George
Thompson, with that lucky dog, Solicitor White?
Anyhow, the young widow Thompson will very
soon change her name to White. Marriages
made in Johanna’s letter are not nearly as bind-
ing, it would appear, as those welded in Heaven.
McGillicuddy, that cheerful Irish medico, is
hobbling round town again witn his broken
understandings almost quite mended and his
brogue as firm as ever. A nasty accident, wherein
McGillicuddy and a dog and a cycle were all in
the cast, put the doctor man out of the running
(after patients; for two months. He is such a
favorite that his friends wanted to present him
with an airship or a motor-car or a grand piano
(he placed his musical choice on the piano), just
to say they were sorry. The gay bloods
among Melbourne songsters rolled up to a smoke-
night and helped in the presentation, and some
hundreds of friends added their contribution and
hurroo. In response, the silver-haired beauty-
man shed tears in his efforts to say thanks, and
the real dew of the Emerald Isle made supper an
all-night sitting.
Miss Kate Hay, one of the oyster harbor
beauties, has been up for criticism in Melbourne.
She has been doing the round of races, theatres
and ice rink with her good-looking fiance. Dr.
Neil Crowley. The Doc.’s new-mown Hay is
summed up as tall, refined-looking, and not too
absurdly youthful.
Carl Bogue Luffmann, wanderer, writer of
books, and lover of plants, who settled for a few
years as horticultural expert at Burnley Gardens,
was last heard of in Spain, where he has entered a
monkery. His friends are wondering what new
freak has driven him there. A man of restiess
caprice, with an extraordinary knowledge of
botany and much other natural science, he has
tramped over quite a large part of this globe. He
broke all records by hoofing it through
some hundreds of miles of Persia. He
has been in almost every city in Asia, as
well as Europe and Australia. (Luffinann was a
great lover of Sydney. He remarked once that it
had the old look of some of the oldest Asiatic
cities, and he put the fact down to the quick-
wearing sandstone that makes the cliffs of the
harbor.) Also he has been through Spain three
times at least—once on embassy work for Great
Britain (he is a Britisher), and once on foot, with
cup and spoon, even as the Spanish substitute for
our swaggie travels. His Spanish is perfect
enough to deceive a Spaniard into taking him for
a fellow-countryman. His book, “The Vaga-
bond,” was drawn together from the memory
of these Spanish tramps. Luffmann was a man who
looked 40 or so, but had the experiences
of a man of quite 104. He is a versatile journalist
—though a vagrant go-as-you-please journalist.
He has written for more papers in more scattered
parts of the ea.rth than any other man I have ever
heard of. The news of his turn to religious
matters makes cynical friends think that he had
struck a bad patch and just went a-monking for
the sake of some square meals. Yet while his
craving for rest lasted—until it were broken up
again by the wanderlust—tlie regular order and
simple life of the monks would suit his aesthetic
sense.
My reference last week to Mrs. White’s Sydney
Girls’ Club as a “big white barracks hanging on
to the edge of North Shore” has been taken
exception to by the owner. She points out
that potential flattites of the unthinking
variety are prone to mix up her Girls’
Club (which is a philanthropic institution) with
Beulah Flats, which isn’t —and the mistake brings
evil financial results to her. Let it be bruited
abroad, therefore, that there is nothing philan-
thropic about the luxurious residences in Beulah
Flats. Good value is given for the money ex-
pended therein, but the cash has to be forth-
coming, or trouble supervenes.

bility of attaching a School of Domestic Economy
to its establishment. Pure Mary-Annism is to be
taught tothe tuneof dainty uniforms and diplomas.
They hope it will catch on; even as did the
movement which caused the pleasant, graceful
nurse to rise from the ashes of the old Gamp.
Nowadays a nurse has nothing to cavil at so far
as concerns her social standing, and because of
that she will put up with solid graft such as no
Sairy Jane willingly tackles. A girl with a tricky
cap and the degree of D.C. (Doctor of Cookery),
or some such honor, wdl be the treasure who is
now sought for with tears and lamentations
by the matrons of the land. The United States
is already hard at work with a practical form of
the idea. The School of Domestic Economy is no
novelty in universities there. The pick of the
lot is at the Cornell Un versitv, at Madison,
capital of the State of Wisconsin. There is a
vast Agricultural College for men, and a set of
classes where girls are instructed how to become
desirable wives for up-to-date young farmers.
Streeton’s last exhibition has been packed up
and drafted off toitsowner. This lot was painted
for the purpose—hurried together with the inar-
tistic disregard of a Made novelist who pushes his
later wares on a hungry pubi c. It was a case of
pot-boiling. The work was scamped and hurried
and thrown together. Streeton did not accom-
pany his goods. He is spreading out the fringe of
his honeymoon, and is “settled down,” as much
as a volatile artist ever does settle down, in
London.
Mr. Pad ley’s' Victorian pioneers had a great
time at their re-union in the Athenaeum on
Friday, the 30th. The one trouble was to keep
them off their feet. Some of them said they could
talk all night; whereupon Mr. P. said that they
could all do that ; but he wouldn’t let them.
There were some fine old fighters in the crowd;
ami almost everybody was prepared to flatly con-
tradict everybody else. After one ancient had
made some statements, much taller than Kos-
ciusko. about the price of meat, or something, he
anticipated the usual contradiction by rushing on
to sav, with tremendous truculence— “And I
defy any man to jail me a liar!” I didn’t know
what might happen after that, so I left.
The Civil Service Rowing Club—the Boys of
the Two Blues—are whales at racing, but they
had not heretofore broken out into the ball be-
loved of such clubs. So they suddenly decided
that a ball was their heart’s desire, sent
out elegant cards with a strip of Two Blues, and
engaged the St. Kilda Town Hall for the hop. It
bopped most briskly to the tune of some 500
guests, who gambolied in the glare of All Red
decorations and glow lamps. Small cox'ns in blue
toggery handed out programmes, and sculls and
boats and river gear hung round to remind
the guests of their hosts. One of the rowing
secretaries, Watson, is a lieutenant and a warrior,
so various red coats splashed round the picture.
The newly-blossomed ball hosts chuckle that the
affair was as crowded as a mayoral shivoo. Guests
hid the distinction of waiting quite half an hour
for their keb from the lengthy queue at two-
o’clock-in- the-morning.
On Thursday, August 5, the Melbourne Shak-
spearian Society is to collect in the Austral Salon
an 1 welcome the Shakspearian Asches, when, in
all probability, the stars will be given a lesson in
how Shakspeare is done here among the rnock-
mummers. Their motto runs, “ Would 1 knew his
mind.” Guess the club would get a shock if it
really did have a piece of the Bard’s mind as
a sample. Guess there’d be no more amazed
mortal on this earth than Shakspeare if
he could materialise again nowadays and
see how generation after generation has
added and built, by painful labor, more stones
to the mosaic of interpretation. In the worship
of their deity, Shakspearian actor-managers have
called learned men of all kinds to their help.
They have had advice from the greatest archae-
ologists of their day. and gradually, by finding
that which was never there, even.as Mrs. Snagsby
of “Bleak House” found out the dark deeds of
her husband, they have built for the great simple
man a very elaboration of intricate detail as a
pedestal. Shakspeare had no millions of tons of
scenery. “I be wall!” “I lie chink!” say
the primitive actor men in the “Midsummer
Night’s Dream.” Humans had to lie the scenery
—likewise they had to be the cook and the captain
bold and the mate and the bos’un and the rnid-
shipmite arid the crew of the captain’s gig. The
only thing really unchanged from Shakspeare’s
time is the hankering of the minors to play star
parts.
Probably old Shaky would enjoy thorough-
going melodrama in a way that would make his
adoring worshippers snort. What is " Hamlet ’’
but melodrama, and could up-to-date bellow pro-
duce more murders in one setting? Why, it’s
strewn with corpses. There is only about one
man left alive at the end of the show.
Amy Castles arrives next Monday by the Mar-
mora, and fish and shipping and other denizens of
the bay are likely to fie demoralised by the wild
reception she is to get. At the last visit of the
warbler the welcoming crowd got a set-back.
Some inconsiderate steerage passenger developed
spots, and the health potentate held the liner at
bay for a day or two. Friends could only go out
in launches and wave flags to their Amy.
Miss Charlotte Hemming, that energetic re-
citer lady, rounded up a concert that was full-
fledged and important. The Very Best People
risked their ninon frocks in the rain, and came
along to hold up the show with jewelled hands.
The funds were to help endow a surgical cot (the
Isabella Bruce) for children at the Homoeopathic
Hospital. The resulting money-bag was fine and
fat. Mrs. ex-Mayoral Pleasance secretaried the
show with hard graft. Chief Justice Madden, with
his most waxen smile, presented Miss Hemming
with what he called “a glorified wedding ring.”
The Madden lady looked anxious, but saw that
the band was large enough to act as a bangle.
There’s nothing binding in a bangle. Miss Hem-
ming, in response, wept tears of distressed joy,
and snapped the bauble on her shapely arm. The
fat money bag will give many poor sick babies
much comfort in their mending. Thereby will all
the worleers be blest above gold and rubies.
Touching Miss Rosie Musgrove’s stage picture
of the sloppy slavey. I mentioned that the open
work of her hosiery was confined to the heels.
An extra special view since then shows me that
this is not so. There is a Jacob’s ladder running
from the heel right up to—well—hum—right up.
These are the same stockings that Marianne Mus-
grove wore in her first hit in the slavey part, and,
with fervent stage superstition, she wears always
the same pair. It is vaguely mentioned, by the
way, that Elizabeth of England had a somewhat
s tnilar superstition; and that she was so en-
chanted with her first pair of silk stockings (pre-
sented to her by the weavers of Flanders) that
she refused to leave them off for a day, until they
dropped to pieces from worn age. So the story
goes. Presumably Elizabeth stayed in bed a day
and let the kingdom run itself while the chief
lady-in-waiting washed and dried the things she
habitually stood up in.
That bird 1 ike warbler, Blanche Arral—with
an enterprising American husband—inspired
a suggestion that Arral was the lost CalvA touring
under a disgn sed name. There was a mystery
associated with Arral’s Past (her singing Past. I
mean), and Calve had disappeared from public
view in a ghostly way for some time. Now the
question can lie settled quite comfortably, as we
are to have the real Cal She is the latest catch
in the enterprising Taits’ fish-net.
The lady has temperament enough to back up
her beauty voice—too much temperament for the
comfort of managers. She is fickle as a swaying
reed, and her promises and appointments are as
changeable as a chameleon or a Fused politician.
Manager people follow her always with a butterfly
net to hold her down to public engagements.
When she is really dragged to the engagement her
sweetly charming manner and her grand air bring
a burst of adoration from her hearers, who are
enchanted by the voice thrown to them—quite a
different thing from the bread plate some stars
hurl at an offending secretary or manager. Calve
is quite likely to boom even in this spoilt country
of many inventions.
The Hugh Ward company intends to suppress
the laughter that has howled, like a dog or a high
wind, round their Princess’s show, and on Saturday
will put on a piece of more solidity. It will be the
only first night on the cards in this Arabian
Nights’ ridden town, and Sassiety and co. are
booking furiously. Besides the Paiotta and Rose
Mnsgrove and Celia Ghiloni, the co. has attached
Mrs. Brough, who will get her share of welcome.
.There is a whisper, too, that the new husband has
d part in the east. He is a fine-looking man—tall
and fair. The cast will be large, and a new
actor-man who is likely to cut ice with the matinee
maiden is also on the bills.
The Staughton dame has a new singing protfyee
coming along—one who had the name of Bird to
start with. And besides the name she had the
more necessary crit. The lady did think, at one
t me. that the Bird would have to give up the
singing idea and take to plain sewing or the
family hash ; but the Bird sat tight and chirped.
There is need of a Horse Act to balance the
Dog Act of old England. Last week a steed in
Richmond bolted, jumped clean through a ground-
fliior window on to a bed, and fetched up in the
middle of the room, conftonted l.y its double in a
mirror. It sounds like a nightmare or a horse-
marine, but it was neither. The same week a
horse belonging to some German importers was
being driven by an employee. Suddenly the
animal realised the full depth and baseness of the
German designs on its beloved mother country,
anti it bolted down crowded Elizabeth-street. It
took the wheel off a buggy that got in the way,
shed its own caravan, and tore along the pave-
ment. Various people were carried off the scene
to lie doctored, and one lady, Mrs. Strachan, is
still hovering between life and death. She tin ned
at the fiendish clamor, tried to dodge the dis-
tracted horse, and was carried before it for yards.
The animal broke its neck against some stone
buildings that got in its way. Mrs. Straelmn is a
daughter of the late James Aitken, one time chief
of Dalgety's.
From “Rosna,” of Adelaide :
There’s a general opinion that Jupiter Pluvius is over-
doing things. It has now rained regularly every day for
a month, with a special storm on Sundays. The neigh-
borly >d of the Reed-beds is, at, the moment of writing,
several feet under water; and the new tramway track
thereabouts has to stretch its neck to keep its head above
the deluge.
At Findon, not far from this drowned locality, the
Point to Point Steeplechase happened the other
Saturday, and (cartloads of shivering girls looked on while
the red-coats plunged through a sea of mud. It was
Mr. J. Pluvius’ most succes ful performance of the
season. He played a Beethoven sonata (with variations)
on the hunt-men, who returned to town in a chastened
spirit. Their Exes, and a daughter were among those i\ ho
watched the fray ; and Mr. Master Reynell, with a sister
to help him, pointed out all the beauty spoi s which would
have been there if they hadn’t been drowned.
Government House h d some 70 or 80 fancv-clad boys
and maidens in to dance on Wednesday night of last
week ; and it rained even for a little thing like that.
Vety sensibly, their Ex’ s. let it be known that they hoped
there wouldn’t be any' extravagant frockirigs ; and mostly
there weren’t. The two vice-regal daughters were garb d
alike as white Follies, and made a graceful pair. There
were cooks who had never seen an uncooked chop, and
Puritans who didn’t go to the Chapman-Ale xanderc rotisal.
The belle of the frivol was a Barr-Smith maiden, as Dresden
Ciiina ; Alice Campbell, as Lady Castlemaine, in a gorge-
ous yellow gown and plumed hat, was another dream
of beauty ; and Mary Milne was a cherub hugging a Teddy
bear. The programme was somewhat different; only one
set of lancers decked it, and most of the other whirls were
two-steps—which same caper has Adelaide firmly by the
feet at present.
Next day his Ex. sped down to McLaren Vale to open a
hen show ; so you see there is plenty of important work
to keep a Governor busy here.
“The Girls of Gottenburg” arrived on Thursday, and
it also rained for that. In fact, anything it doesn’t rain
for is of no importance whatever. Adelaide is glad to
have the Girls after a theatrical drought of some size,
and society is now giving its diamond tiara the periodical
polish and airing.
The R. Cruickshanks gave a delightful revel for the
local infilntry in a well-trimmed Town Hall at St. Peter’s
on Friday evening; and a crowd of pretty babes whirled
from 7 till 10.30, with a few grown foik to interrupt
now and then.
The late Speaker Holder was buried in the midst of
Monday’s furious downpour. His Ex. and all officialdom
were there, also the army and the navy. All but the very
valorous clung to their vehicles, and did not venture into
the dampness. A trio of aides stood at the graveside,
representing the Governor-General, the Governor-
Ordinary and the Lieutenant-Governor. The Holders
are unostentatiously pleasant folk, with many brains and
degrees among them ; and Adelaide is telling them it is
very sorry, and meaning it. more than usual.
Lest the moths should get into the ballroom, the Exes,
have announced the glad tidings that they will be at
home on the evening of August 11, and all the Peerage
and Disappearage which receives a card to that effect may
come into supper in its best frock. It has to be a very
swift moth that can do much damage at the Residence in
these stirring times.
President of Manufactures Cleland and his brethren are
going to have another “Manufacturers’ Day,” the same
as they had last year, only better. It will happen on
September 14, when Adelaide will have another chance to
marvel at the number of things it has been buying from
the foreigner, because it didn’t knowit was making them
better itself.
The folk who have taken the Seamen’s Mission under
their well-feathered wing are not going to let the grass
grow over that institution for want of cash and care.
Two of them, Mrs. Benson and Mrs. Onslow, gave a gay
little afternoon tea on Monday at the Onslows’place, at
which the guests were requested to bring a trifle to put
in the plate in return for a good programme of melodious
noise. Woodville’s peerage flocked to it in a well-dressed
body.
Adelaide, which is nearly half-Methodist, and, there-
fore, addicted to “revivals,” simply revelled in the
Mission. It went every day, and got converted ;it heard
that dancing and theatres were the invention of tbe
overseer of Gehenna; it gave “at homes” for the mis-
sioners, and prayed and sang hymns with great gusto.
Then it had dinner quietly, and either went to the Tivoli
or booked seats for “Gottenbuig.”
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.


Until SATURDAY
these 25 volumes may be secured for a first payment of only 7/6, purchase to be completed in
[Bookcase 6ft; high, 3ft. i 6vd.fi, Sin- deep.
Books lOfyin. high, tfyin. thick, 7in. tvidp.]
27 monthly payments of 7/6 —or cash (i.e. at the rate
of 7/11 a volume).
Until SATURDAY
the form of subscription printed at the foot of this page is
worth about —the difference between the present and the
future price of the History in Australia.
The Times liopes
that readers of The
Bulletin are al-
ready conversant
with the subject of
this announcement,
since the time for
any lengthy consid-
erations upon the
subject of the His-
torians’ History of
the World is passed.
There now remains
time only for the
despatch of your
order.
To such as are,
nevertheless, unac-
quainted with the
History, or are bal-
ancing in their mind
whether or no to
have it, this much
may confidently be affirmed, that they cannot go wrong who
decide in the affirmative, All the evidence goes to incline the
scale on this side.
No other history of the world has appeared in English since
the time of the Erench Revolution, and no other possession can
be imagined as a more natural and proper factor in the intel-
lectual life of any household than a comprehensive record in
which may be read the history of our own and of every other
people—the experience of the human race. On the other hand,
the fact that others around him are using the History will render
him that goes without the more sensible of his lack.
The question of ways and means affords no ground for
hesitation. A. postal note for 7s. 6d. secures delivery of all the
25 volumes (with bookcase if desired). No further payment is
required until a month after you have received the volumes, then
purchase may be completed in monthly payments of the same
small sum, or slightly higher amounts for the better bindings,
and in the end you will have paid less than one quarter of the
usual cash rates at which new copyright books are sold.
In signing the form of subscription printed below, therefore,
you commit yourself to very little, and, while incurring an outlay
which you will scarcely notice, you effect an extraordinary
bargain.
No orders posted later than August 7 will be accepted. There-
after the History will be procurable only from London, at the
higher price already in force there, with freight and charges at
purchaser’s expense.
At this eleventh hour, indeed, there is but one thing
to do—fill in and post this subscription form with 7s, 6d ,
and one way of doing it—at once.
Free Delivery. —The History and bookcase will be delivered free to any address in the seven centres
where stock is held, \\z., Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Launceston, Melbourne, Perth; Sydney. Beyond these
limits goods will be sent carriage forward from nearest centre, except that (1) for an extra 2s. (prepaid) for the
books, and Is. 6d. for bookcase, carriage will be paid to any port in the Commonwealth or railway station within 100
miles from any of the seven centres ; (2) for an extra prepayment of 10s. for the books, and 7s. Od. for the bookcase,
carriage will be paid to any railway station. Subscribers remitting more than 7s. Cd. with their order are requested
to indicate what portion, if any, is on account of carriage.
Subscribers completing purchase before the stipulated time, by cash or increased instalments (payable
monthly, quarterly or half-yearly, to the Timks Office in Australia, or to any branch of the Bank of fLS. W.), secure
5% discount upon balance that would have been outstanding had they made payments of only the stated amount.
Subscribers are notified as their payments fall due.
A Choice of 4 Bindings. Contents precisely the same for all.
(1) For those who desire to purchase the History in the most economical form, Tun Times has had a smart
scarlet Cloth binding prepared. For a standard book in constant use, a leather binding proves an economy in the
end, but the cloth will give satisfaction to any subscriber, who, after taking the better bindings into consideration,
chooses the least expensive.
(2) The merit of the Roxbnrghe style is that the leather back gives strength to the most vulnerable part of
a book. Dark wine colour, prettily ornamented in gold.
(3) The fact that the leather comes so far over the cloth sides renders the three-quarter Morocco binding
all but equal in appearance and strong! h to full Morocco, while the cost is verv much b‘>-s. because the binding of a
volume does not cut into a whole skin. The colour is dark green, richly ornamented in gold. The style is strongly
recommended, and offers the greatest value for the price.
(4) The full Pigskin binding is superb. The fine grain and warm colour of the heavy natural skin is
beautifully set off by the noble Gothic design covering back and both sides. Indestructible. Improves with
exposure and use.
Cash Payment.
Should you prefer to pay cash, and receive a discount of from 5| to 9 per cent., please indicate the binding
required, and remit as follows : Cloth, £9 18s. ; Roxburghe, £l2 17s. ; f Morocco, £l7 125.; Pigskin, £22 17s. ;

Some Points concerning the Historians’ History
of the World.
1. The Historians’ History of the World is
complete. It begins with the dawn of civilisa-
tion in Egypt and Babylonia, 4000 years or more
B. C., and, embracing the histories of all nations,
ancient and modern, eastern and western, carries
the record down to the year 1908. We have to
go back ten years before the French Revolution
to find a previous attempt to give English readers
the whole of history, and as the 19th century
not only added an immense chapter to history
itself (it fills 2400 pages in the Historians’ His-
tory), but also revolutionised the study of it, The
Times History may make the unique claim of
being the first to occupy a field than which none
more important or attractive can be imagined.
For history, the finest of all studies, is truly con-
ceived in all its grandeur, in all its instructive
similiarity and fascinating variety, only when the
records of different ages and different nations are
taken together as constituting one consistent epic
—the experience of the human race.
2. The second great characteristic of the His-
torians’ History is its detail in every part.
Although it embraces all nations, each one is
treated as fully as it would be in a standard
history of that country. To most of its possessors
the Flistory will prove, not only their first uni-
versal history, but also their first history of
France (to which over a million words are
devoted); their first history of America (560,000
words); of Germany (979,700) ; Russia (396,000);
Scandinavia (340,560) ; Italy (435,600) ; Spain
and Portugal (435,600) ; Greece (900,000) ;
Rome (800,000) ; to say nothing of Egypt and
Babylonia (409,200) ; of the lesser, but not less
interesting Western powers; of the Moslem
world ; of India, China and Japan. This is
what The Times meant when it claimed that
practically the tvhole of the work would, be new
save to the professed student, and one may, with
liltle exaggeration, include in this sweeping
statement that portion of the History which deals
with Great and Greater Britain (2,i75>600
words).
3. The perfect world history must be, as the
Historians history is, a work of collaboration
and of collaboration among historians of
different nationalities. Moreover, the work
of the great historians of all ages is directly
drawn upon, so that the reader obtains, not
merely the best that can be written to-day, but
the best that has ever been written.
4. This method of construction ensures three
valuable qualities; first and foremost, truth.
Never has the human record been more thoroughly
sifted than in the preparation of this work.
Secondly, impartiality in matters of opinion.
Thirdly, a most attractive variety of style and
in the point of view.
5. The illustrations constitute a striking
feature of the History. The 2800 illustrations in
the text, and 236 full-page plates, reproduce for
the readers’ benefit costumes, armor, portraits,
buildings, scenes and places, famous historical
paintings.
6. The history was written to be read. The
principle upon which the entire work was made
is suggested in the editorial dictum to be found
in the preface—‘ ‘ Properly presented., the narra-
tive of history should have all the breathless
interest of a novel. ”
7. At the same time, the ample index (vol.
XXV.) renders reference as easy as the finding
of an address in the directory.
8. The 25 volumes (each containing, on an
average, 660 pages with 660 words to the page)
have been produced with the utmost care as to
materials. The print is large, the paper of
good quality, and each of the four bindings is a
fine example of its style.

of the “ Times ” (7 O’Connell-Street, Sydney, or 75 Eiizabeth=street, Melbourne),

SCIENCE SPEAKS.
In the treatment of any wound or sore, you
must not disregard the facts revealed 'bv
scientific investigation. To heal speedily and
permanent*’ it is essential to cleanse the affected
tissues and remove any poisonous element that
may be present. The part must then be so
soothed and vitalised that Nature can restore it
at once.
To accomplish this result, an ointment must be
used which, in its action while allaying all
irritation, penetrates to the underlying tissues
and purifies thoroughly.
Chase’s Universal Ointment is recognised as
the most unfailing preparation for the treatment
of cuts, wounds, bruises, etc., and skin
diseases in eases of long standing.

DANCE.
An Astonishing Cure of
this Complaint.
$
Striking Example of Success of
the Tonic Treatment.
The cure of St. Vitus’ dance by Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills is a striking example of the power of a
tonic acting through the blood to cure even the
most serious nervous disorders. This power is
due to the fact that the nerves, like every other
part of the body, depend on the blood for their
nourishment, strength and health.
St. Vitus’ dance is the commonest form of
nervous trouble which afflicts children, because to
the great demands made on the body by growth
and development there is added the strain caused
by study. It is when these demands become so
great that they impoverish the blood, and the
nerves fail to receive their full supply of nourish-
ment, that the nervous debility which leads to St.
Vitus’ dance begins. The remarkable success of
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills in curing St. Vitus’
dance should lead parents to give their children
this blood-building medicine at the first signs of
the approach of the disease. Pallor, listlessness,
inattention, restlessness, and irritability are early
symptoms.
The cure of Winifred Curtin, daughter of Mrs.
Margaret Curtin, 24 James Street, Kingsholme,
Brisbane, is sufficient proof of their power to cure
this disease.
“ Winifred got a fright through a tram passing
too close to her, and then St. Vitus’dance started,”
said Mrs. Curtin. “She got very nervous and
very irritable. She wasted away to a skeleton.
She was quite bloodless, nothing but water would
come if she cut herself. She got worse every day,
and could not go to school. She lost the power
of her legs for years. She had to be fed with a
spoon, dressed and cared for like a baby. Every
muscle twitched and quivered, and her eyes would
roll in her head. She was three months in the
hospital, and had the best medical advice and
attention, but she was only getting worse. She
couldn’t walk from room to room without falling.
When we took her from the hospital she was
carried out and driven home in a cab. For the
next eleven months she used neither hands nor
feet. She used to lie in an easy chair on the front
verandah, and had to be helped in every way.
Then a friend from Sydney advised me to give
her Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, which I did. With
the second box I noticed her hands were not so
tightly clenched, and we were simply overjoyed.
As she went on with the course, the twitchings
grew less, and she showed an inclination to eat.
Every box found her a little better. The power
and strength came back to her legs, and she could
walk without stumbling. Presently she began to
put a little flesh on her bones, and she got some
color in her face. In a little while she could help
and do little things for herself. She got bright and
cheerful, and presently was getting about as well
as anyone. She could sleep well, and her nerves
got strong and her blood rich. She is cured now
and goes to work every day.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Argus, rejoicing over the circumstance
that T. Bent was not found £ nifty of actual fraud
or corruption by the Commission that inquired
into Tommy’s land dealings, says that “everyone
jeaious for honest government will feel relieved ”
at this fact. And yet the Argus would probably
give a lot to have one half of Bent’s proven ili-
doings attached to a Labor leader. Then what
black and fearful infamies they would be! The
grimmest grievance of the Tories is that they
cannot throw dirt at the Laborites, no matter how
much of the substance they may have on their
hands.
A cablegram which happened along last
week brought the news that the Standard Oil Co.
of the United States had practically bought up
the Central American republic of Costa Rica—at
least the financial control of CoSta Rica has been
handed over to Standard Oil for a cash
consideration ; and when any concern gets
the power of collecting revenue and deciding
how it will be spent, it owns so much of the
country that the balance doesn’t matter. This
stupendous and ever-encroaching oil monopoly is
the concern which is so beloved of the Australian
Freetraders that they refuse to protect the Aus-
tralian oil industry against it. Yet one would
think that when a Trust lias become so vast that
it buys up casual republics before breakfast, it is
dangerous enough to justify any country in shut-
ting it out.
Premier Wade to Beeby, M.L.A., in the
State Assembly the other day :
The State Government would not consider a proposal to
grant a pound for pound subsidy to the Dreadnought Fund,
on the understanding that the whole amount be handed
over to the Federal Government for the purposes of local
defence, because it was the province of the Common-
wealth itself to deal with matters of local defence.
And yet a while back, when Dreadnausea looked
like coming to something, Wade let himself be
badgered by the Sydney dailies into promising
that the State (the same State which is revolted at
the idea of finding £BO,OOO for the defence of Aus-
tralia) would provide about £l,ooo,ooo—one-half
the cost of a Dreadnought, Victoria finding the
other half—-for the defence of the United King-
dom ! It is very characteristic. Your tvpical
State-frighter is always at least 12 times readier to
fork out his borrowed cash for the benefit of an
overseas country than he is to do it for Australia.
The Commission which inquired into
Adolphus Bent's land dealings tells Parliament
that in its opinion the enthusiastic land jobber
gained nothing pecuniarily or personally, and that
he had nothing whatever to do with the purchase
of the Penders Grove Estate ; but. as to Mari-
byrnong, Mont Park, Werribee and Thornbury,
he either exceeded his duties or interfered un-
duly, and so prevented the lands being bought at
a lower figure ; and it further finds that the Bent
Government is to blame for tolerating and failing
to protest against Bent’s interference. As to bis
paddock along the Brighton electric tramline, the
Committee finds that Bent allowed the Assembly
to be misled, and did not show respect for the prac-
ticeand honor of Parliament. It is a vaguefinding,
though the evidence didn’t justify anything more
explicit; it merely means that Bent was an in-
corrigible old meddler, and that his meddling cost
the public a lot of money.
“ Billy T.” re a recent comedy:—
A Parliamentary party has 179 recognised ways of mak-
ing an ass of itself, with power to add to the number, hut
no party ever made itself a more dreary and distressing
mother of a mule than did the De >kook crowd when it
caught up Bill Lyne for asserting that old veteran Groom,
of Toowoomba, would turn in his grave if he saw the
political company his son keeps nowadays. For 10
minutes the Government push blithered and wept and bel-
lowed in a state of greasy indignation over poor William’s
very commonplace reflection. But the climax was reached
when Groom, M.H.R., rose, his eyes filled with
great tears like Dutch cheeses, and crying,
“Oh, don’t ! don’t !” fled the chamber, an
anguished son prostrated by the suggestion that his father
wouldn’t approve of his present line of action. For a day
or so, until Hansard came out with big William’s harm-
less remark and showed what had really happened, I
thought Lyne had turned body-snatcher and had been
found digging up the last resting-place of Groom senior.
The bathos of the whole infuriated protest was more
banal than anything I had seen before; and I’ve
witnessed “Blood the Buccaneer, and the Virtuous
Sarah ” played in a tent at a Bungaree country fair.
POLITICAL HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK.
The crowning act of his public life bad been his self-
effacement to allow of the fusion when he had put his
country before himself. (Cheers. )—Mr. Oakes on Georgia.
GEORGE: “ Coo-ee , Halfred! Letcher can 't see vie!”
The one effective gibe which the Fused
people can throw at the Labor party is that it is
itself a I usion—a coalition of Protectionists and
freetraders. It sank the fiscal issue in order to
have a chance of office ; and, consequently, when
it throws a brick at another crowd which sank
something else for the sake of office, the missile
has a tendency to fall short. Almost all the
Laborists are Protectionists nowadays; but there
should be a Protectionist, plank in the party’s
platform—and it should he nailed on hard.
The State Parliaments still indulge in the
absurd flummery of officially “presenting” the
various local Excellencies with the Address-in-
Reply. Would anything happen if, for once, one
of them casually forgot all about it, and just
bogged in to work?
A REVIEW BY COMMANDANT COOK
AND STAFF IN 1920.
The appointment of Mr. Joseph Cook as Minister of
Defence is a sign that this department of Ministerial
work will be esteemed more important than ever before.
Mr. Cook has undertaken to face the task of putting our
neglected forces into real fighting order,— Tory Press,
joyously.
The above represents a realisation of the Tory
ideal. The staff includes Herr Von Loanstein
(prominently associated with defence finance),
Oyama Spi (the successful tenderer for a per-
manent supply of small arms and ammunition),
Cheetah Ali Khan (v;ho holds a contract for the
supply of remounts), and the well-known local
gentleman, Paymaster I. M. Porter (greatly
esteemed by the staff in general), not to mention
Hiram T. Hogg (canned-meat purveyor), and
others.
The S. A. Labor members have entered
enthusiastically on their mission of making things
unpleasant for the Peake Government. There are
more thanjjalf a dozen of them who can speak for
three or four hours at a stretch on anything or
nothing, so that the prospects of doing work are
not rosy. The Government, however, isn’t worry-
ing much about work ; what it wants is time, so
that the public may get used to the new alliance,
and develop the habit of considering theLahorites
as one party and everybody else as the other
party.
A sort of progress report issued last week
re the number of new applicants for the Federal
old-age pension, atid the number who had got the
article, was staggering. These were the figures
Applications. Granted. Refused.
Queensland .. 381 .. 85 .. 296
Victoria (about) 2000 .. 1290 .. 710
Tasmania (about) 1400 .. 600 800
N.S \V 1564 .. 476 .. 1038
Westralia .. 1206 .. 29 ... 1177
The figures suggest that some very energetic
magistrates nre trying to save the Federal revenue,
but in Westralia especially they seem to be over-
doing the economy. Victoria it will be noted,
grants more pensions than the other four States
put together. But the curse of land monopoly is
still driving the young men and women out of
Victoria and leaving behind the aged dere-
licts, the old maids, the great blank spaces, and
the hopelessness of Premier John Weary.
“ Gwy ” : Those who think an Australian-
built navy impossible might take a hint from
Japan, Years ago it was rumored that Viscount
Hayashi, then Japanese Minister in London, was
about to give an order for several
warships. Sir J. Fortescue Flan-
nery interviewed him to try and
get the order. The Jap replied in
shaky English : “I recognise that
the ships could he built cheaper,
quicker and better in this country
because we have not attained the
skill in shipbuilding you possess;
hut I must tell you frankly that
my Government is determined
that these ships shall be built in
Japan, and for this reason—we
want our men to he educated in
shipping affairs; we want them
to understand as they can only
lie trained to understand by actual
practice; and the Government is
going to make such sacrifices as
the shipowners may require in
order to ensure the work being: done in Japan,
for the purpose of educating the people to carry
out similar work in the future.”
“ Casual ” writes from Wellington (M.L.) :
The M.L. Government’s retrenchment panic continues.
Everywhere two departments are bein>>- compressed into
one, and a single Barnacle is being called upon to do the
toil of three. Radical changes loom in the Stamp Depart-
ment. The creation and issuing of stamps is to be trans-
ferred to the G.P.O. The assessment and collection of
deceased persons’ estate duty will occur in future at the
Land and Income Tax Department, and all work in con-
nection with deceased persons’ estates is to be centralised
at Wellington. The assessment of stamp dutv on deeds
and all other instruments will henceforward be made by
the District Land Registrar, instead of by the Deputv-
Commissioner of Stamps. The once stupendous Tourist
Department is now a mere side show or odd corner in the
Agricultural Office. The trouble is that M.L. as a busi-
ness concern is not paying. The crew of the ship has
been too big, and many members seem to have forgotten
whether they were passengers or on the articles. In the
good days the constitution of the Ministry was a whole
essay on the multiplicity of the Barnaul family-. When
the present Cabinet was formed. Ward was Prime
Minister, Minister of Finance (Cashier), Postmaster-
General; Minister of Telegraphs* Minister of Industries
atid Commerce, Minister of Defence, and Minister of
Tourist and Health Resorts ; and some of his colleagues,
down to the Minister of Innards (or Internal Affairs,'were
almost equally numerous.
Still another authority drives holes through
the theory that the only defence “the colonies”
need trouble about is the defence of the North
Sea. Longmans Green’s latest military publica-
tion in London is by Major Silburn, D. 5.0., who
has made a special study of S. African war possi-
bilities, and now writes a hook—“ The Colonies
and Imperial Defence”—which is
getting a lot of attention in Eng-
land. Silburn is an Imperialist,
and says it is for that reason he
regards colonial contributions to
the British navy as badly-spent
money It ought to he “devoted
to local defence, so that in the
event of war the colonies would
he able, unassisted, to ward off
any enemy, and leave the Im-
perial navy free and unfettered to
seek out the enemy wherever he
may he in greatest force, and, if
possible, destroy him.” TheDread-
noughters’ idea, though, is to give a
Dreadnought, and then, when
trouble comes, to borrow that
Dreadnought and half a dozen
other ships in order to brush off
any venomous little mosquito fleet
that the enemy may send this way,
or the way of any other of the
colonies. And the withdrawal of
that Dreadnought and the half-
dozen other ships might easily
mean all the difference between a British victory
and a British disaster.
It having become necessary the other day
to elect a new Speaker of the House of Repre-
sentatives, the Government party held a caucus on
purely Labor principles to choose a man. It was
agreed that it should give a solid vote in the
House for the candidate thus selected, and it did.
The Labor men couldn’t have applied their own
“solidarity” principle more thoroughly. And
yet “ caucus rule ” is one of the chief objections to
the Labor party—-curiously enough.
THE FIRST ELECTIVE MINISTRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the neolithic age of our Australia, long ago,
There dwelt a wise old chieftain, as vou probably don’t
know ;
His royal tastes and habits I won’t venture to describe,
Hut his plain hbrse-sense was noted and applauded bv his
tribe.
Now, this chief was not a despot, as you will, perhaps,
conclude;
I'or, though debate was noisy and procedure somewhat
crude,
There did exist a Parliament, elected in due form,
With a Premier and Ministry—which made things pretty
warm.
For the style of Party Government, in vogue about that
time,
Was inclined to lead to discord—not to mention down-
right crime.
For boomerangs and waddies were used freely in debate ;
And, as a rule, ex-Ministers were spoken of as “ late.”
For the salaries of Ministers were not to be despised ;
And “emoluments of office” were, indeed, most highlv
prized.
The Premier got five ’possums and ten fat grubs a day,
While a snake and three gohannas were his colleagues’
daily pay.
Then other perks and privileges happened such as these :
The Minister controlling Rain and State Corroborees
Got all his ochre on the nod—in other words, his clothes.
So portfolios were coveted, as you may well suppose.
In consequence, the whole procedure of the House was
“fight.”
No Ministry created in the morning saw the night.
And all the posts were sinecures the shorthand writers
filled ;
For the press-reports read briefly: “Sixteen wounded;
seven killed.”
Now, the practical King Billy could not fail to recognise
That this bad old Party system was not either right or
wise.
Public works were at a standstill, and the tribe was losing
wealth.
Not to mention that the House’s sittings menaced public
health.
The Department of Smoke-Signalling was in a shocking
state ;
And Defence had been forgotten in the noise of the
debate.
The Flint and Sandstone Bonus Bill was shelved time and
again ;
And the tribe was getting very short of able-bodied men.
The common-sensed old chief sat down and pondered
hard and long;
And thought him out a simple scheme to right this crying
wrong.
Then he dissolved the Parliament and called his tribe
around,
And told his plan ; and all agreed his arguments were
sound.
“ But then,” they said, “ it’s most unconstitutional, you
know.
Besides, we have no precedent; therefore you have no
show.”
But Bill dispensed with precedent and substituted sense—
Whereat the anger of the tribal Tories was immense.
“ The nation’s welfare,” said the chief, “is what I have
in mind ;
And this bad old Party Government must all be left
behind.
Henceforth I set my Parliament a task it may not shirk,
And members will, please, understand that fighting isn’t
work.
“ We’ll have Elective Ministries, and they shall rule un-
harmed
For forty moons ; and members must attend the House
unarmed.
Next election you may club them, should their actions
prove unwise ;
And for the second term the victors may enjoy the
prize.”
They called it “Socialistic”; but King Billy had his
way.
For forty moons each Minister enjoyed his place and
pay.
Since only once within that time the chance of office
came,
The members took to making laws, and ceased to “ play
the game.”
Peace and prosperity henceforth smiled on the chieftain’s
reign ;
And, ere he died, he said, “ Behold, I have not ruled in
vain.
Down through the future ages shall my Great Reform
descend.
Australia shall bless my Simple Notion till the end.”
But, if you study recent history, you’ll note King Bill
Was most forlornly out of it ; for they are at it still.
The daily fight for fatted grubs excites the same old
gang;
And debate is mainly waddy, and division boomerang.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
At time of writing the Maori team in Sydney
has won all three scraps ; and as the campaign consists of
only five, it has got away with the O.T. Cup beyond all
chance of recovery. The first scrap was won by 24 to 21 ;
the second engagement by 14 to 11, the third upheaval
by 16 to 14. The secret of Australia's downfall was lack
of speed in getting the leather to the three-quarter line.
The leaping Maoris shot round so fast that they smothered
the halves and made a loose game in winch their extra
vim bustled and fogged the Pakehns. The extra ounce
that caused the trembling beam to fly up with a sudden
kick was the fearsome speed of Asher, easily the fastest
man on the ground. He either raced past or crashed
through anybody who got in front of him—he wasn’t par-
ticular which he did. His Homeric game was superb.
Running' at full speed from one end of the ground to the
other on Saturday he suddenly heard behind him the feet
of a fresher man than himself. Transferring the ball
from his right to his left arm, lie swung his head and
shoulders round, apparently without decreasing his
speed. A long arm was reaching out to grasp him.
Asher seized it, dragged the pursuer to tiie ground, and
swept triumphantly over the line. It was a match that
simply bristled with mighty deeds.
It also bristled with other things. There was a
sense of impending trouble—a strained feeling which,
generated in the crowd, infected the players. Even good
old Owe’Sullivan, walking across the" ground with a
Maori lady, was requested to say what he thought of
White Australia. Like Saturn, who went on making
oysters for another 1000 years, Owe’ said nothing, and
discreetly retired from public view. On the field the
game got more and more willing. Every man who was
grassed was banged down with a will. Reputable persons
swore that they saw wallops exchanged, but writer did
not. The mob howled furiously at referee Hutcheson, as
fair a man as one could wish to see. It was said lie made
mistakes. Who on earth doesn’t, when lie has to travel
up and down the ground like a greased cyclone with a tin
kettle on its tail? The wonder is that he saw half as
much as he did.
Writer has played against Maoris about a score
of times, and, without exception, found them Chivalrous
opponents. They are tiie kindliest of people, generous
to a fault. This scribe lias been bowled heels over head
by a strenuous Maori times without memory ; and when
the stars had passed a kindly brown face remarked, “My
word, kapai! ” and a helping brown hand has beeii
offered to assist the dropped one in regaining tiie perpen-
dicular. It is not only the Maori custom, it is the Maori
nature. But they did not do it on Saturday, a sure sign
they were feeling sore and standing on their dignity ; for
the air was full of hostility and suppressed passion.
Hoodlums who knew no more about the rules of the game
than ttiev did of those of algebra, howled at tiie referee
to take himself off the field. Much of the howling came
from astand labelled in large letters “ IJOQ- PAVILION,”
and appropriately enough it was from this quarter that
came the curs who first rushed the ground and made for
the referee. Immediately the game was over the Maoris
rushed down on tiie Cup they had won and, three of them
waving the lid, cup and pedestal, broke into a fearsomely
genuinb haka, in which the whole XV. joined. They
howled and shouted, and shook the eartl} with their feet,
and protruded their tongues to sucli an extent that tiie
first wave of the mob recoiled to avoid strangulation.
But fresh thousands poured on to tiie ground and
demanded the innards of the' referee, round whom, like
the Scottish knights at Flodden, the police formed a dark
stern ring. The air was full of bashed fruit, hags of sand,
yells and curses. Blows and insults came thick. The
police lashed back savagely with batons and fists, and
slowly hut surely hacked a path to the pavilion, where
the referee was detained an hour. Outside, a huge baud of
toughs hung about till the police attacked them, threw
one over the picket fence, and put the rest to rout. Then
the “ fun ” was over.
It is always a sign of strenuous play when the
pants begin "to go, and on Saturday at Sydney Agri-
cultural Ground fresh unmentionables were in demand
every few minutes. In fact, there was more delay over
pants in that match than in any other this writer re-
members. Stilbit must have been welcome to the
players—it was the only breathing space they got in an
unusually fast game.
On Saturday night the Sydney Metropolitan
Union held a solemn service over the reputation of its
XV., which had that afternoon been defeated by tiie
Ponsonby team from Maoriland, and the Ponsonbies had
only just landed off a boat that had been the best part, of
a week battling across the Tasman Sea. That the Auck-
land crowd should be able to play at all was remarkable,
enough ; hut that it should overthrow by 13 to 11 a first-
grade! Sydney Metropolitan XV. was a hideous thing.
Fortunately there were only about 9000 looking on,
30,000 of the regular habitues having gone to watch the
Maoris rampage away with the O.T. Cup ; so the killing
was, one might say, semi-private. What is going to
happen when these elephantine Aucklanders get their
land legs and start out in proper fettle is too dreadful to
think of. The prayer of the Union is,‘‘From the furv
of the Ponsonbies, good Lord, deliver us !>” All the
same, the chances are that as soon as the Ponsonby men
realise how hard our ground is they will drop the cheer-
ful, slathernmwhack style which served them in such
good stead on Saturday.
* *.’_■* •
The N.S.W. Union XV. at Brisbane bad an
easy time of it on Saturday, when the Northerners were
trodden under by eight points to three. Barfing a high
westerly wind, the ueather was superb, and Jhe attend-
ance of about 7000 was considered good. Queenslanders
had the benefit of the wind in the first half, and Car-
michael made the most of it with high punts that kept
the Walers on the gallop. It was the same wind that
enabled the same fine player- to kick a beautiful
goal from 'exactly half way. The Walers met this
with a series- of short passing rushes which harassed
the Queenslanders very much. At half time the
score was three all. The second half found the Corn-
stalks with fhe wind behind them. It was expected that
they would romp over Carmichael’s merry men ; but they
didn’t. The Queensland defence proved so good that
N.S.W. managed to score only one solitary goal. Car-
michael was, to use the words of Johnson Weir, a tower
of strength, and, in the second half, lie used the touch
line in a masterly manner, and kept the raging Walers at
hay by consistently kicking out of touch. In (act, Car-
michael appears to have been the beginning, the middle,
and the foundation of the Queensland team. Great is
Carmike.
The Sydney Soccer Competition for the
Gardiner Cup is raging-. Already sudden death has
overtaken eight clubs—Balgovvnie, Balmain, Granville,
Helensburgh, Newtown, Northern Suburbs, Rozelle (B),
and Ultimo—and they lie by the roadside. Those still in
the running are Adamstown, Glebe, Kozdle (A), Pyrmont,
and Sydney. Saturday’s butchery included Helensburgh,
which went under to Adamstown by four goals to two ;
Newtown, which was crushed by Sydney by two goals to
one; Granville, which fell to Glebe by‘two to one; and
Rozelle (B), which was quietly slaughtered by Rozelle (A)
with two to one.

In Victorian oofball matters the position of the
League and Association clubs is “as you were,” save that
Essendon has a slightly rosier chance of reaching the
League semi-finals. The lesson impressed by South’s
hoodlums.the week before had been laid to heart, and a
liberal supply of f ot and mounted police were spread
over the various grounds. But for the sloppiness under-
toot the collision of South and ’Wood would have been a
joyous spectacle ; as it was, a fast, fair and willing “ go ”
ensued, marred only by patches of close, scrambling play.
South’s “marking” was fine, and for heavyweights on
slippery grass they were amazingly quick ; but their
efforts to meet the methodical play of the Magpies told
on them, and bv three-quarter time they were palpably
tiring-. Still they were then only four points in the rear,
anti a goal would give them vie ory. But the “ Ool-
lingwood finish” came along, and in five minutes
South was four goals to the bad, and the game
was over. The Red-and-White barratkers bellowed
to their pets and raved to them to bog in again, but the
most the tired battlers could collect was a couple of goals,
thus handing over the first place in the competition to
their opponents, who, with anything like their proper
play, should hold it to the end. Scores were, South 43
points ; ’Wood 54. The concussion of Essendon and ’Roy
drew an equally crowded house to the E ist Melbourne
ground, in the knowledge that the Maroons were doing
practically their dash for semi-final honors. They
held their own in the first qu irter and had collared a
lump of Essendon’s share by half-time, when their tally
was 40 points to ’Don’s 22 ; but thereafter they faded to
nothingness, only adding nine points while the “Same
Old” piled up another 47—69 points to ’Roy’s 49
altogether. It was a lamentable catastrophe for the
Maroon supporters, for unless the team.can manage to
defeat Carlton on August 14 it will see no semi-final this
year. When Melbourne drew with ’Wood On June 26, it
had apparently reached i he top of its form ; it continued
lusty enough to w Hop Richmond, and it capsized poor
little St. Kilda ; but South and Essendon have pissed it a
couple of “dirty doings,” and last week Carlton rolled it
further in the mud, by 81 points to 30. It was a Impel.-ss
effort, eminently typical of the “Red Legs.” A win
against Carlton meant a very fair chance of the semi-
final. but Melbourne is an accidental sort of team that
every season threatens to reach the head of affairs,
and then fades tamely away and gets bogged in the middle
distance, if one may put it that way. A lot of people look
on the collisions of the two ancient clubs —Carlton and
Melbourne—as something sacred and superior to the riots
of novices like ’Roy and ’Wood ; but, the fact, these
enthusiasts overlook is that, whereas Carlton has for
years been there or t hereabouts when pennants were cap-
tured, Melbourne has got its name first on the list only
once since ’76, and then in a casual, unaccountable sort
of way. The fetich about Melbourne’s football prowess
ought to be burked. As to the outsiders, Richmond up-
ended Saints by 65 to 49, and ’Varsity put 87 points on
the board while Geelong put 47 ; but, as the boy said
when his old man pus .ed him on to the platform five
minutes after the train had gone, “where’s the use of
hustling now ? ”
• * * *
Of the Ass. squabbles, the only one that attracted
as much interest as a pawnbroker’s loan was the P’ran-
Essendon scuffle, which speedily developed into a dis
tracking exhibition of lopsided kicking. There was little
to choose between the teams up to three-quarter time.
Both spent much endeavor to little purpose, P’ran in
getting 1 goal 6 behinds, and ’Don in capturing 12 be-
hinds; but in the last spell the latter got two goals as
well as four more behinds, while the P’ran men could only
acquire one goal and a behind—l 9 to ’Don’s 28 points. It
was the sort of game that should have been heard in
private. For the rest, ’Scray tumbled ’Cote over the
landscape, with 64 points to 24 ; Brighton accumulated
71 points to Port’s 38, and Brunswick embellished
its average by notching 97 points to Preston’s 18.
Also, ’Town collided with North, the casualties
being represented by the figures 29 to seven,
in a manner of speaking. Possibly had the teams
played football, ’Town might, have made the discrepancy
larger, or North might have turned its sewn into 70,
there’s no telling ; as it was, the ball seemed to be a
minor consideration to both parties, and the umpire was
fully occupied in smothering brawls.
The irregular “play” through the week com-
prised the suspension for the rest of the season of a Rich-
mond ’bailer for “jobbing” an opponent; and the
“ cautioning ” of another for using the elbows too freely.
At Broken Hill an umpire varied the usual programme by
“stoushing” a reporter whose criticisms of his umpiring
failed to gain his approval ; and at South Melbourne
seven youths were fined £1 each for too violently ex-
pressing their convictions of the “deadness” of cert,ae
of Skinner’s hirelings in the South-Carlton match. As
one of them remarked, “ Blime, we could ha’ stoushed
the three stiffs themselves fer less ’n’ that.”
The South Melbourne TTootball Glub authorities,
shocked by recent outrages, have resolved to construct a
subway from the ground to the dressing rooms, so that
visiting players shall not come in Contact with the on-
lookers. This is a good idea, but perhaps, after all, it
would be wiser to build a series of stout iron cages right
round the field, and admit spectators to these, keeping
them securely under lock and key during the progress of
play, and until umpires and. visiting players have been
removed to a safe distance when play is ended. The
provision of subways may only lead to players being
hunted to their burrows like rabbits, and pos-dbly having
to endure much suffering while being- smoked out.

“ Silas Snell ” : I was in the thick of the rough-
up on South Melbourne football ground- the other Satur-
day, when the success of Fitzro.v stirred South to its
foundations, and filled the barrackers with bitterness and
a lust for bloodshed, and I am of opinion that, if girls
must go to football matches, they should at least he com-
pelled to leave their umbrellas at the gate and be
searched for hatpins. No enthusiastic footballing
female is fit to be trusted with a brolly or a hat-
pin anywhere within jabbing distance of the opposition
team. The S. Melbourne insurrection was one of the
most violent on record. Quite 3000 people raged and
rioted for a chance to bite the umpire, and, failing in
that, they were willing to dismember any ’Roy player
within reach, incapacitate a policeman, or cripple a
visiting b irracker. They punctured the players, gave a
few ’Roy supporters a grievous mauling, and trod
two constables in the mire. The fair sex revelled
in the fray, some with drawn hatpins but the majority
with steel-tipped umbrellas wherewith they jabbed
viciously. If armies fought at close quarters nowadays
this sort of practice would be good training ; but, un-
fortunately, bayonet work is almost out of date, and the
woman who prods the hostile footballer with her um-
brella isn’t learning to defend her country worth a cent.
* * * *
The restriction of Test matches to three days’
duration helped to make the fourth Test a drawn game.
The first day’s play yielded an innings each to England
and Australia, the Kangaroos making 147 to England’s
119. Then down came rain, during which Australia raised
the second innings’ effort to 289fornine wickets (declared
closed). England had scored only 108 for: three
wickets when time ran out. The result is to leave the
“ ashes” with Australia, the Kang-aroo having won twice,,
been beaten once, and drawn once. The XI. that was con-
temptuously advised to play only the weak counties has
wiped the floor with Father Bull. Therefore, sound the
wild timbrel and bang: the cymbal, not so much on
account of the victory of the Australians, but because the
first XI. sent home by the Board of Control has justified
that body’s selection.
* * « *
“S.T.S.”: The fortnight between the second
and third Test matches saw a terrible exhibition of the
modern English slump into pi in hysterics. Fry and
Leveson-Gower, who had chosen the England team for
the second (in Ilawke’s absence abroad), w ere denounced
on all sides. They were appealed to to make a self-
denying: ordinance and resign from the Selection Board.
Jessop had imt been asked to play. (He had refused to
play.) Brearley had been asked to play only on the
in riling ol the game, and had refused in disgust. (He
wasn’t asked at all, and didn’t refuse.) Younger men
ought to be selected. Maclaren ought not to be captain.
And so it went on daily, stress being laid on every
possible thing except the trifling detail of Armstrong’s
bowling, which had won the game. Whether the tumult
died down or got worse when the third match confirmed
the result of the second has yet to be seen. Worse,
probably. It used to be the French who proverbially
yelled, “We are betrayed ! ” whenever defeated. Kow it
is the English.
* tr ■* *
Someone with a mechanical mind has invented
a practising board against which the would-be cricket
fielder heaves the hard ball. The ball flies off at all sons
of unlooked-for angles, and the catcher becomes expert
in fielding a sphere that bolts three ways at once. This
is said to make for superiority in the slips. Another genius
has invented an automatic bowler which one can load up
with a certain number of balls. It will bowl at any angle
and practise any off theory, and rock ’em in fast or slow as
desired. So the batsman sets it going’ at the style he is
most helpless against, and becomes proficient. Trumper
had a couple of hours on it the day before he made his
top score. An English doctor spent two years in develop-
ing and perfecting it. What a fine art cricket is coining
to. II >w in thunder a game that requires all these aeces
series to make for decent playing is to remain popular,
Hetven knows. Still, it is pleasing to find that young
men take so much interest,in it. On second thoughts it
isn’t pleasing. A man who can waste two valuable years
over an automatic ball-thrower is too darned prodigal
of time altogether.

On August 21. by tho grace of God, Miss Gertie
Lewis and Mrs. Hyde will disturb the placid calm of
Parramatta River with a soidid sculling match for £25
a-side and the title of Ladv Sculling Ghampioness of
N.S.W.
Stated last week that Webb is anxious to have
another go at Artist; and now conies word lhat his prin-
cipal backer, Brother Tuck, is even mo e anxious.
Richard the Great, possibly with a view to getting a
chance to open up another rich vein in the Wanganui
gold mine whence.he has already extracted £looo in
stake money, has been loudly proclaiming that he was all
out —“couldn’t have done another half mile to save my
life, sir !” Webb is said to have rowed on another five
miles to his boatshed and have shown no signs of dis-
tress. It begins to look as though Richard the Great is
an even better business man than he is sculler and
bikist!
* , •*,. * *
Marry Pearce, of N.S.W., was not long making
another tugging match, and will row G -urge Day for an
amount yet to be agreed upon, on September 25. If
Pearce wins that, and Richard the Great is still in parts
adjacent, he will be invited to show what he has up his
sleeve. .
N.S.W. Hockey Association has got together
a first-class team for the invasion of Victoria; a team
that will smite either ihe feet of the Gumsuckers or the
leather with a mighty Whack. Practically the best
smiters in the whole State are banded together in that
team ; and great will be the biff, for having been properly
trained and exercised together they have the combination
that is far above rubies, and better than eloquence or
fair women. This sounds mix d, but it is the truth.
Said that, the Victorians are training assiduously, and
there is going to be something done when they clash. In
addition to much smiting there will be some talking.
The invaders take in their pocket a draft constitution for
the Hockey Association of Australia—perhaps Australasia.
After it has been discussed in Melbourne, it will be passed
on to the other States, and it is fondly believed that by
the end of the year a really strong Continental Associa-
tion will be on deck, and perhaps bring the game on to an
electoral or district basis. Which, if it conies off, will
make things boom mightily.

English papers are noted for mixing np Aus-
tralasian. happenings ; but tl is, in the Siok'isman, is an
outsize in blunders. Apparently ihe Spoktsman does not
keep record of sports outside its own island. “Hick
Arnst is a powerful man, who first gained prominence
as a cyclist. Indeed, in 1906, at Sydney, he won a
long distance race over 500 miles, iii which the first
prize was £lOOO, the most valuable race in the world.”
Presumably, the wretched English paper means the
Sydney Thousand, which was a mile affair with a first
prize of £750. Still, it. is a relief that Sydney was not
mentioned as a suburb of Dunedin on the Murray, which
flows into the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Backed up hy part of Caulfield (Melh.) Council,
tiie local Progress Association lately made another
attempt to get Weary Murray to shift the V. A.T.C. from
ii;s present stand. Tnat ihe racecourse blocks the pro-
gress of the district is obvious—just as obvious as the
fact that the club wants to bang on to it as long as it can.
The arguments addressed to Murray were, however, so
copious and mixed that four representatives of the bodies
interested are to sort out their views and present them
after they have been licked into order. The club went as
far as to offer to buy If) acres outside its on n course for a
public cricket ground ; but that little sprat failed to
catch any mackerel. Evidently, however, it realises that
it. must soon do something, so it has acquired some sort
of option over 600 acres of land adjoining Bent’s Mordial-
loc Small Holdings paddock, at £2O per acre. This is a
beautifully level block with a slight rise for stands, hill,
etc. ; hut it will need three miles of branch line from
Mentone or Mordialloe station. Some of David Synie’s
money is said to be sunk in the spec.
The brazen frauds who recently threw out the
latest attempt to legalise the totalisatorin N.S.W. should
be reminded of their ill-deed at election time. The old
gag that the State must refuse t.o legalise gambling has
been completely knocked on the head, for the State has
legalised gambling wii h bookmakers on the racecourse.
It is all legalised, regulated, charged for, and protected.
The Owe’Sullivan objected to the tote, because boys and
girls would pool their “sprats” to invest. Just as if
they didn’t do it now with the bookmakers, and do it
niore easily because they do it secretly, while at the tote
it could be vigorously suppressed for it would have to be
done openly. McGowen jumped on the tote because
it was not proved to his satisfaction thatl it would have
“ a tendency to morally uplift the people and because
he is “ a representative man,”whatever that may mean.
Price objected to it because it would, by making betting
more fair, encourage gambling. Price should introduce a
Bill to legalise welshing ; then he would be a Heaven-sent
reformer. Also, he seems to be a badly informed person,
who labors under a delusion that bookmakers only
acefc-pt bets in large sums. He has never seen
the gentle punter taking half a dollar’s worth. W. E. V.
Robson objected, because “N.S.W. should be, proud,
when one comparesthe number of criminals.in oiir gaols
to-dav with the number there years ago, when the popu.
lation was smaller. That is an argument against the in-
troduction of the totalisator.” (It maybe, bup only a
mind like Robson’s can detect it.) Cann objected because
it increased ihe numbers of bookmakers—how, he did
not explain, and never will. Wood voted against the
proposal because, although he was in favor of-it, it bad no
chance of passing. The humbugs who threw out the
Bill were; Cann, Charlton, Cohen, Collins, Davidson,
Downes, Graham, Hall, Henley, Hogue, Hunt, Jones
(two), Latimer, Levy, Lee, Lonsdale, McCoy, McGowen,
Mercer, Moore, Moxham, Nobbs, Parkes, Perry, Price,
Storey, Waddell, Wood, Onslow, and Taylor. These are
the friends of the bookmaker.

rum, jun., and George Gray commenced at 3 p.m. on
Monday last. As mentioned last week, the total is 16,000
up, and Gray receives a handicap of 2300. The match is

George-street, Sydney, on one of thf finest tables in the
world, specially manufactured for this hall by the famous
Alcock co. The box-plan can be seen at the Alcock Co.’s

When King Ned’s moke Minoru won the Derby
recently, Fogland apparently went mad, threw its dignity
to the winds, and entirely forgot all about the deference
due to royalty. It’sawful to have to print it ; but when Ned
led in his victorious prad, the common public that keeps
him on his throne swarmed round him, patted him on the
back, and stuck out their hands for him to shake. Great
Socialism! What is the Mother Country coming to?
One excited individual even went so far as to exclaim,
“Good old Teddy 1 You’ve won the Derby, now turn out
your damned Government!” That wild individual, by
some oversight, wasn’t struck dead by the Almighty, or
mobbed or arrested or hung, as we’ve been led to believe
anyone would be who vvas so familiar with “ His Imperial
Majesty.” The Empire must be falling to pieces. It
won't be long before someone walks up to Ned in the
street and says, “ Look here, Teddy, sack your politicians
and go in for Protection. By the way, how’s Lily
Langtry ? ”
Johnson is irrevocably tied up in his agreement
to fight Ketchell, and to keep faith he has deposited
1 10(10, which has been duly covered. The fight is fixed
for October 12, nt Colma, California. Jeffries appears to be
about the second most, unpopular man in all the Americas ;
pride of pi ce in that direction being held by the present
champion himself. Meanwhile, Johnson has talked
mightily of cleaning up a few dishes of lemons in between
jusi to keep the motor-car going ; but it is generally
believed that he will avoid all fights till he meets Ketchell,
which will be a good paying business, as the gate is cal-
culated to yield $30,000, and the winner is to take the
large end of it. So far, the negro, detested as
he is, has scored heavily off Jeffries by remarking
that, if it would suit Mr. Jeffries, he would be
willing to accept a verbal promise to fight, upon a fixed
date. This affectation of fine, old-time chivalry vvas the
last straw ; and when Jeffries didn’t respond, Yankeedom
turned him down with a bang, shook itself, and then
went out and commenced to talk about Stanley Ketchell.
Ketchell is not suffering from swelled head. He admits
that he is up against it, and has set to work systemati-
cally to build himself up for the great day in October.
When things had got to this point the voice of
Fate shouted in Jeffries’ ear, and the gigantic agricul-
turist woke up. He began to realise the transient nature
of earthly glory. Quite suddenly all interest in him had
ceased, and nobody cared a curse w hether he re-entered
the ring or broke his neck or ran for President. Stanley
Ketchell was the hero of the hour, and in full possession
of the limelight. From London th Mclntosh was cabling,
in his magnificent wav, making arrangements for Tommy 7
Burns to fight Langford, and the winner to fight, Ketchell
for the championship of the world when Stanley' had
blown out “The Big Smoke.” After the way he handled
O'Brien it was.evident that Ketchell is of the stuff
champions are made of, said the world. So Jeffries rushed
out and deposited coin of the republic equal to £lOOO of
our money that he would fight, Johnson within astipulated
time. Nobody took any notice ; people flatly d* dined to
be interested in big Jim. Then he cabled the Mclntosh
offering to fight anybody in England, and asking for a
staggering sum. The Mclntosh replied that, £lO,OOO was
his figure, no more, no ,less ; and if James J. could get
more elsewhere, to take it. And apparently James J.
can’t: and the man from Sydney, at present appearances,
has him for his own.
However, it seems that Tahmmy is not taking
any trips to Britain to fight Langford, or anyone else —
bur, Johnson. If Langford likes to come to Sydney-
well. that is another mat ter. Then we shall see things—
perhaps.

Sy'd Willmott and M. Duffy boxed a lively con-
test for the Victorian bantam championship at Melbourne
Cyelorama one evening last week. Svd Willmott, held the
championship a few years ago, and vvas a keen little boxer,
but he seemed to lack st amina, and stamina and weight,
beat him in his fight with Duffy. While the affair lasted
it was brisk and scholarly. For six or seven rounds
Willmott rattl'd it about the larger man like hail on an
open-air Venus, but Duffy settled all arguments with a
few solid polthogs that left Svd open to anything that was
going. In the ninth the referee declared that Willmott
had taken as much as he could hold, and Duffy is the most-
distinguished bantam of the Cabbage Patch.
.Tacky McGowan met Bob Greenshields, the
lad from whom he snatched the Australian light-
weight championship, for the second time, on July 28.
This struggle was a Ballarat fixture, and drew a great
crowd. A rather unsatisfactory scrap ensued, in which
McGowan showed the wear and tear of 40 .years or there-
abouts, and the clinching was reminiscent of some of his
old battles with Tim Hegarty. The encounter went 20
rounds, in the latter half-dozen of which “Gentleman
J cky” was in a decided minority. The referee’s decision
in McGowan’s favor provoked a yell of public execration,
and wh n Greenshields put it to the meeting in pitiful
tones, “Gentlemen, was I licked?” the motion was
carried in his favor with a unanimous whoop.
BAD BREATH.
The Tongue is the Index.
Your breath is foul, but you do not perceive it
yourself. You are like a person who is always
among the oils and varnishes—you get used to
what is to many people a most obnoxious stnell.
It is most disagreeable to those with whom you
come in contact. A slight headache, a bad
breath, and a coated tongue are the first symptoms
of stomachic disease. Take time by the forelock,
and intercept germination ; arrest the germs ere
they develop into disease. A pill in time may
save days of suffering. Look at your tongue in
the looking glass every night and morning, and if
it is at all discolored take a couple of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. They will remove the objec-
tionable matter from the stomach, regulate the
system and sweeten the breath. One or two of
these pills, taken once or twice a week, will ensure
a well-regulated system, fortified against all
disease.
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching
remedy, and are a permanent and positive remedy
for biliousness, indigestion, constipation, bad
breath, headaches, sallow complexion, liver and
kidney troubles, piles, pimples and blotches, and
for all female ailments.

Two schemes for obliterating the Chow
opium smoker happened simultaneously the other
day. The Comptroller-General of Customs, Dr.
Wollaston, suggested that the drug should he
admitted into the Commonwealth under the old
tariff, and the duty collected (it used to amount to
£50,000 or £60,000 per annum in the pre-prohibi-
tion days) expended in bribing Smo Ko to take
his soporific habits back to China. Dr. Wollaston
thinks that Smo Ko would generally be open to
reason on a cash basis, and, as the immigration
laws are now fairly effective, the opium bother
would soon peter out- But Secretary Tong, of the
Chinese Anti-Opium League, went one better.
There was no paltering with vice about Secretary
Tong, who seems to be a better Australian than
his name suggests. Bis notion was that the
opium-smoking Chow should, whenever captured,
be started back on the instant for his own Flowery
Land—not bribed, but shoved. Secretary Tong
has clearly the better idea of the two.
“W.C.M.”: Seven good reasons in favor
of the establishment of an Australian Navy are as
follows:
(1) H.M.S. Powerful; (2) H.M.S. Encounter; (3)
H.M.S. Psvche; (4) H.M.S. Pioneer: (5) H.M.S. Chal-
lenger; (6)'H.M.S. Pyramus ; (7) H.M.S. Pegasus.
“ E.F.” writes :
This suspicious world seetns to be losing' faith in our
poor begging relation Dreadnought. A member of
N.S.W. State Parliament has asked several questions
about poor Dreadnought in the House, and the
first one was whether Dreadnought really exists.
Dreddy has gone down hill dreadfully since he
started on his career from that club amidst a welter of
headlines and champagne. He is only seen now at.infre-
quent intervals in the back columns of the daily paper ;
his hair is sticking through the top of his hat, arid, gene-
rally -peaking, he is in a shocking state. Something will
have to be done for him soon, or he may be found in the
river one of those mornings, and then there will be a
dreadful scandal, and all the family will have to go to the
inquest.
A man who is shortly going to lose a com-
fortable job is Professor Harrison Moore, of Vic-
toria. In the clays when it was the fashion for
every dunderheaded State Premier to worry
about “ Federal encroachments,” Bent appointed
Moore at £3OO a year to overhaul Federal
measures and report all proposed outrages on the
privileges of the States. As there never were any
encroachments or outrages, the Professor has re-
ceived £OOO without producing any results, and
Premier Murray is tired of the very poor joke.

In June, 1904, the co. had in hand estates valued at
£1,098,331 ; now the tally is £1,412,977. Some of this
long jump is no doubt due to the spring in land and other
values in Victoria ; but, even allowing for that, the Bal-
larat district is evidently cottoning on more and more to
the idea of having a trustee who won’t die first, or won’t
be awav on a trip to England when he is wanted, or won’t
sudden] v depart for Guam later on, or won’t become in-
capable'of transacting business. The revenue for the
half-year was £3417. Deduct £1067 (about 4 p.c. p.a.)
for interest on investments, and £2350 remains as
the revenue from the trustee and agency business. This
would work out at 6s. Bd. p.c. p.a. on the value
of the estates in hand. That is to say, assuming that the
co. gets all its revenue (apart from interest) from trust
estates, those estates on the average pay J p.c. p.a. of
their capital value for the co.’s services—and a great
many other people charge much more for doing much
less; the broker, for instance, who charges 1 p.c. for
selling your big line of investment stock, or the auctioneer
who knocks down your household goods and pockets 10
p.c. of the proceeds. And still, on the basis of capital in
the business, this, like most other trustee cos., does very
well indeed ; last half-year its profits were at the rate of
£9 19s. sd. p.c. p.a. on capital and reserves combined.
The reserves, by: the way, have just got past the capit d,
so that there is'now over £30,000 behind the co.’s promise
to correctly interpret and faithfully carry out the dead
man’s instructions.

This co.’s published accounts give, at the best, no more
than a general indication of how things are going. When
nothing at all, or very little, is added to visible reserves,
it can be taken as a hint that the next div. will probably
be cut down ; when the amount added to reserves is on
the up-grade, it is a hint to look out for something better.
Just at present there is no reason to expect a movement
either way. The declared profits for two and a half years
past have been very uniform. Probably the private
balance-sheet has shown something different ; the uni-
formity may have been arrived at by writing off more or
less to cover depreciation and wastage. There is no way of
telling what amount is thus writ ten off. Six months ago
the big item on the assets side, “Mining property, includ-
ing mineral lands, buildings, railway, rolling stock, pits,
tunnel, etc.,” stood at £102,964. It has now been re-
duced to £100,655 ; and that looks as though the amount
written off was £2309 plus anything spent on new
works, plant, etc. The financial position is good. The
liquid assets (including £5168 in suspense) total £88,193 ;
sundry creditors (including hank) total £22,197 —a surplus
of £65,996. Five years ago the surplus was £68,273. The
balance along: with the reserves added in five years has
gone into property. Practically everything- depends on
how that property item is written down, and nothing
definite can be said about that. A coal mine is a wasting-
asset ; so the revenue in excess of expenditure isn’t all
profit—some of it is capital ; and enough of it ought to
be put aside to refund the capital by the time the mine
is exhaust d, or new properties ought from time to time
to be paid for out of revenue to replace the depreciation
of the old one. An investor must know what a coal co.’s
policy is before he can value its shares ; for obviously if a
mine has only a few years to run, and the co. has no
other assets, the bulk of what he receives in dividends he
must pass to a sinking- fund.

The co. has a capital of £15,000 and no debts. Retort
renewals and general maintenance are charged to revenue ;
the amount written of is independent of that. Wear and
tear appears to be thus provided for out of profits,
which is another way of saying that the dividend is
earned, and that the co. is not eating- up its capital.
The Broken Hill mines are now tearing out ore
at a great rate. During the first half of ihe year, though
the Broken Hill Prop, and Block 10 did practically nothing,
43J,690 tons were put through the lead mills. Irrespec-
tive of the B. H. Prop., which doesn’t report the result of
its mill work, the half-year’s output of the field was
13,000 tons more than for the first half of 1908—which will
probably surprise a few people who thought that the
whole industry was laid up by the recent long strike.
Some idea can be got of the size of the hole that is being
made in Broken Hill from this comparison : it is a good
year when the whole of the mines of Victoria turn out
900,000 tons of stone ; yet that output is being exceeded
by the South, Sulphide, South Blocks, North and Junction
North alone—and thatexcludes the B. H. Prop., Block 10,
Block 14, British, and Junction. At present Broken Hill
appears to be producing about one-seventh of the world’s
total output of lead, which may explain why, when the
B. H. Prop, furnaces got to work again, the lead market
promptly became languid, and is now down to about
£l2 13s.

The Woah Hawp mine, of Ballarat, which has
lately distinguished itself by winning nuggets at the rate
of £2OO a day, belongs to a line of properties which used
to be nearly all owned by Ah Ohow and Co. One of them
still has a Chinese legal manager, and the only white
persons connected with the mine are those who work it.
The half-yearly meetings of this particular Woah Hawp
Co. are something unique in the mining world. They
take place on the top floor of a chop-suey “joint” in
Lillybuck-stleet, and resemble, to the alien reporters
who attend them, some weird form of Asiatic wor-
ship rather than a serious business gathering. Pro-
ceedings open with prayer; then, instead of reading
the minutes of the last meeting, the chairman begins
by burning a joss stick and trilling a few strains in the
tenor tone affected by ttie midnight cat, while a chrome
Kubelik accompanies him on the one-stringed fiddle.
Then everybody has tea and converses with iiis nearest
neighbor; after which there is a quaint ceremony con-
nected with taking out, of a cupboard sundry china orna-
ments and pieces of embroidery. These are passed round
reverently, and, long soup having been served, somebody
makes a few well-chosen remarks which are understood
to signify a vote of thanks to the chairman. Then the
shareholders descend to the ground floor, where, a few
years back, before the passage of the present Gambling
Act, they would mark a ticket hospitably offered by
somebody, and go off, apparently to draw their dividends.
There is no long-winded speech by the chairman, telling
shareholders that solid masses of gold would be reached
when they got to the lower level; there is no noisy,
half-informed shareholder making vague charges against
everybody on inadequate grounds ; there are no tricky
dir ctors stalling off suspicious scrippers by diplomatic-
replies and bunches of proxies. Most strange of all, a few
years ago there was nearly always a dividend.

BEALE PIANOS have been ordered and supplied exclusively, for the magnificent
new STRAND PALACE HOTEL, LONDON, whose public rooms are second to
none in Europe, and which will be opened in September. They are in the aristocratic
watering place of LE TOUOUET, neari Bologne, in the beautiful hostelry, “LE
HERMITAGE.” They are in MAURITIUS, CAPE COLONY, NATAL,
CEYLON, the TRANSVAAL, FIJI,' TONGA, NEW GUINEA, NEW
CALEDONIA, PORT DARWIN, NEW ZEALAND, and in the furthermost
settlements of AUSTRALIA. From all these places we receive hearty and voluntary
letters of commendation.

Penniu, May Bth, 1909.
Dear Sirs, —I do not know if you have sent pianos to China before or not, but I think it is only right to let you know how
your pianos stand the climate over here. Perhaps you remember me buying the instrument at St. Arnaud, Vic., a few years ago.
We have since then brought it to China, and when I went to Australia a few years ago I took it with me, and not staying therb as
1 first intended, I brought it back again to China a couple of months ago, and, after all its travelling and rough usage by Chinese, it
is in splendid condition. Every time I go to it I cannot help feeling pleased with the, sweet, full tone, which is very unusual in
pianos in China. We are in the interior, where we have the two extremes of heat and cold, which is very severe in its effects on
most pianos, but which has proved your instrument to stand all you said it would when I. first bought it from you.
Yours very truly,
H. J. COLLIS,
Penniu, via Shanghai, China.
A CHIEF ENGINEER ON THE COLONIAL SUGAR REFINING COMPANY’S ESTATES, LATE OF NAVUA, FIJI,
NOW OF MAC KAY, QUEENSLAND. ' v
The climate of that part of Fiji in which the Beale Piano was located was about the worst possible place that could be found
anywhere. I may state for your information that the main island of Fiji, “ Viti Levu,” is divided down the centre by a mountain
range, on one side of which it is nearly always raining, owing to the clouds being backed up against the mountains by the trade
winds. During the sixteen months that the Piano was at Navua I do not think there were two consecutive weeks, of fine
weather. Under these conditions you will easily see that the instrument had a pretty severe test. It was always up to concert pitch,
however, thus proving your contention re the Beale-Vader Patent. Ido not anticipate having any difficulty in keeping my Piano in
good order in Queensland, although some little care will he required during the wet season. I beg to forward the name of
as being a likely purchaser of a Piano. I hope to be able to supply you with the names of likely purchasers from time to time.

Let the Old Folk
Hear Your Voice
You can readily imagine what a treat it would be for the
old folk in the homeland to hear your voice. Far away as you
are, they simply long for the familiar tones, and no number of
letters can compensate for their loss.
Why not cheer them up by making a few records for the
Edison Phonograph and sending them along ? One of your
favorite old songs, a chatty message about your affairs, or a
recitation that you knew years ago would be a great source of
comfort and joy to the old couple.
Tt’s a simple matter to make the records, and we’ll gladly
tell you all about it if you write us. The many uses for the
Edison Phonograph make its purchase a grand investment.
It provides the best of entertainment any time and any-
where you like, and its almost infinite variety of records
appeals to all tastes. Call at your nearest dealer and hear
some of the latest four-minute Amberol Records.

IN BANANA LAND
No country can fool with syndicate rail-
ways without getting scratched ; and it never
knows where the scratch will happen. When
Kidston was weakening, but wasn’t prepared to
go the whole borrowing hog, he compromised and
allowed the usual syndicates to build the usual
railways on terms ; that is to say, the syndicates
were to find the money and build the railways,
and the State was to guarantee 2 or 2i per cent,
interest, and have the right to take over the lines
later on, by paying about 28 times the average
earnings for the previous five years. Among others
the Chillagoe Co. got the right to build a line to
the Etheridge, and charge 50 per cent, more
than Government rates. Now the people further
on—right along to Croydon—want the railway ;
but they don’t want to pay any syndicate half as
much again as the State would charge; conse-
quently they want Kidston to do the extension.
This puts Kidston between Beelzebub and the
deep.sea ; for if he lets the syndicate build the
line the people will have to pay 50 per cent, more
than Government rates for carriage, and they will
kick if lie makes them do that-; while if he builds
the line with the State’s money and carries goods
at a low rate he will simply be feeding the syndi-
cate’s line, and the State will have to pay for that
when it comes to talk about taking over the rest
of thb railway. Kidston says his motto is “ Gang
fqrward.” But when he considers the syndicate
railways and the knot in which they have tied
him, the chances are he' wishes he could gang
backward a bit for a change.
A legal tale from Brisbane :
Isles v. the Brisbane City Council has at last ended.
It has been going; strongly for upwards of three years. It
started when Jim Isles, President of the Central Rate-
payers’ Association, one of Brisbane’s whitest men, issued
a writ against the Brisbane City Council to enforce the
financial separation of the various wards —in other words,
he wanted to prevent moneys collected in one ward being
expended in other wards in works profitable only to such
other wards. For instance, ward A may produce only
£5OOO a year in rates, yet by its aldermen combining with
the aldermen of wards B and C, £lO,OOO a year may be
expended in ward A. This sort of business is not confined
to Brisbane. In almost every Shire Council in Queens-
land there are three divisions, and very often one of the
divisions has as little spent on it as possible—the coun-
cillors of the other divisions forming a secret combination
to annex for their districts practically all the money
available.
Isles read the Act of Parliament and reckoned this was
unlawful. He got a barrister’s opinion. The barrister
said Isles was right. Isles wrote to the City Council.
The City Council got three barristers’ opinions and then
told Isles he was wrong. Isles sent his barrister’s opinion
to the Council and asked to see its opinions. The Coun-
cil refused to show them. Isles told the Council he
would sue. The Council said he might. The Council has
plenty of money—ratepayers’ money.
These things were done three years ago, and, as stated,
Isles sued. That was the beginning of sorrow. Mind,
the whole dispute was as to the meaning of a short
clause in an Act of Parliament, Isles thought the
matter would be disposed of easily. The Council pleaded
that Isles should have given notice as in the statute made
and provided. Isles said he shouldn’t. The Full Court
of Queensland said Isles was right, and ordered the Coun-
cil to pay his Costs. Isles smiled. Trial No. 1.
The Council appealed to the High Court, which said
Isles was only partly right, and that each party should
pay its own Costs. Trial No. 2.
Then the real question re the financial separation of
wards was got at. State Chief Justice Cooper said Isles
was right, and ordered the Council to pay his Costs as
between solicitor and client. Isles was pleased. Trial
No. 3.
But the Council still had plenty of money. It appealed
to the High Court of Australia. The appeal was heard
in Brisbane before Griffith, Barton and Isaacs, who, after
three days’ argument, said it had better be re-argued in
Melbourne before five Judges. Trial No. 4.
After many months it was argued in Melbourne before
COURTEOUS.
LADY (sternly): “ John Jones, you have already had too much strong drink! Have you any
more left in that bottle?”
JOHN JONES: “ Very sorrish, ma'am. There’s not much left, hut ” (genially) “ I’m sure yer
welcome to it. Help y’self.”
a Full Bench, and judgment was reserved. Trial No. 5.
When judgment was delivered four Judges were clearly
of opinion that Isles was wrong. Isaacs dissented, and
made it plain that in his opinion Isles was perfectly right.
Isles was ordered to pay the Costs of the whole of the
proceedings. Isles did not smile, but he applied to the
Privy Council for leave to appeal.
He got leave a year ago, and a day or two ago he got a
cablegram that the Privy Council would advise his
Majesty that Isaacs, the solitary dissentient, was right.
Trial No. 6.
Isles smiled once more and is after the Council for the
£lOOO cheque he had to pay it for Costs under the
High Court judgment, and for interest thereon.
And Cooper and Isaacs, the Judges whose views have
been upheld as against the combined opinions of Griffith,
Barton, O’Connor and Higgins, smile the same sort of
smile that Isles does.
A leading Cairns (N.Q.) Chow merchant
recently got this suggestive letter from a fellow-
countryman in Fiji :
You Cairns banana-growers will have to fight exceed-
ingly hard to cope with us, no matter what restrictions
are removed. We find it simply a question of labor. My
firm, which is largely interested in the fruit, has just
landed 400 Chinese coolies. These cost us about 10s. a
week. This is the kind of thing you’ve got to deal with.
It is a good instance of the situation the Free-
trade Laborist is fighting like a mob of baresark
elephants to bring about. This queer logician is
quite sure he wants the Australian banana indus-
try to be a white man’s industry, paying a white
man’s wage, but all the same he demands that the
Australian industry shall win out against the Fiji
growers who pay 10s. a week. Seemingly, the
Freetrade Laborite’s idea of a white man’s wage
is 10s. a week, or less. Queensland banana-
growing is understood to be chiefly a Chow in-
dustry (although a fair number of white growers
are battling along somehow), and it won’t be the
Freetrade Laborite’s fault if it doesn’t go on being
chiefly a Chow industry.
You can buy half a sheep—very fair
mutton, too —in Charters Towers nowadays for
half a crown ; and, in spite of rings and market
fakes, the South will have shocking luck if it
doesn’t get much cheaper chops before long.
Queensland hasn’t quite got up to the 1892 record
of 21,708,310 sheep, but it is making a remarkable
dasli that way. In 1902 its flocks were down to
7,213,985, and at the last count they were up to
18,348,851, with another fine lambing in sight.
Cattle haven’t come.alqng so fast; for though the
long drought didn’t wipe out so many, the tick
kept the numbers on the down grade until 1903.
Since then there has been a spring from 2,481,717
to 4,321,600 ; so there is a reasonable chance of a
slice or two coming off the price of beef steak
before the next generation wears out the second
set of the teeth it eats its boiled cow with.
The Australian Parliament has just fin-
ished its censure debate after a month of lament-
able shindy and recrimination. The Queensland
State Legislature has also had a month of the
same sort of thing, and the Kid-Philp Ministry
came out on top by a majority of one. Still it
means to hang on. The S. A. Legislature
is starting a censure debate which will prob-
ably last till the cows come home. Of
these Legislatures that of Queensland is the
really shocking example. It has done nothing
that can be called work for nearly two years.
The old Assembly dissolved on December 31, 1907-
The new one met on March 3, 1908, and sat till
April 20, which brief period was mostly filled with
recrimination. It met again on November 17 and
sat till December 23, and that brief period was
mostly filled with the same thing. Then after six
months’interval it met once more,-and there has
been nothing but the same thing ever since. The
time of that kind of Parliament is divided into two
principal parts : (1) the time when the House is
kept shut for fear the Ministry will lose its job
when it opens ; and (2) the time when the House
is open and the Ministry is fighting to retain its
job. And as both these times are of no use to the
community, The Bulletin votes for Elective
Ministries—a system which takes the question of
the Ministerial job right out of politics except
once every three years, when a new Parliament
meets. An elective Premier, with a fixed tenure
of office, is just as logical as an elective Speaker,
holding his job on the same basis, and it is time
Australia dropped to the fact.
“Leo Lear,” from Queensland :
’Possum slaughter is again in full swing, and the
scramble for the skin of the little marsupial is, if possi-
ble, keener than ever. What with snares, guns, rifles,
dogs, and cyanide—although the latter is prohibited by
law —it is unsafe for poor ’possum to show even the point
of his nose from the hollow sanctuary of his native gum.
The outlaw is fair game for everyone, so scalpers, station
hands, cookies’ sons and town loafers all join in the hunt
for fur. At the present rate, a decade will see tiie tail
end of the last ’possum. The cause of the whole
trouble with Joey is his irresistible inclination
to walk—unlike the ordinary Christian—the narrow,
straight track, that in his case leads to the
snare and destruction, and to ignore the broad
smooth tree trunk wherein his safety lies. Just now
skins are up to high prices, the summit of i hem being
somewhere in the region of the shipping trust’s charg s.
As much as £l5 a week has been made in the Taroom
district, and 'possum rushes promise to be as fashionable
as the g-old ones of early fame. A few days ago a large
cattle station found itself minus boundary riders, all
hands having chucked the bovine-mustering racket for
the more lucrative one of ’possum-snaring. This life,
like the cow'and rabbit trades, is of the early and late
category, and, after working at it for some time, the
scalper's system becomes permeated with the peculiar
pungent, penetrating perfume of ’possum—so much so
that if one enters a railway carriage the other occupants
sniff and depart. Most of the skins are exported in the raw,
so curing and rug-making are evidently among the things
Australia can’t do. As this continent supplies most of
the planet with the material for’possum rugs, surely it
ought logically to manufacture them. Another case for
an export duty. Oh, the legislation we want and the
time spent in swopping billets ! Verily, the day is fast
approaching when Australia will don its number twelves,
invade the Houses of Parliament, and kick the mace to
Jerusalem and the dogs, and drag the Shrieker (or is it
the Speaker?) from his chair, and throw him headlong
into a coffee stall.
The Happy Family.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LOW in the heat of noon from his long quest-
ing,
Amid dry twigs and spines,
Awhile a weary traveller was resting
’Neath lonely Queensland pines.
Across the brittle needles hopped and chorused
The Happy Family,
And when no other sound disturbed the forest
Bore him good company.
About him gaily with no dread of dangers,
They chirped their roundelays,
And danced, as they had danced tootlier strangers
On other sunny days.
He threw them crumbs, and as they fed and chat-
tered
He seemed to catch their song.
An echo of the past, when nothing mattered,
Of times when life was long.
And harking back to scenes of pristine glory,
Of cattle, camp and yard,
And wantonness that in the after story
Made recollection hard;
He spoke to them, steeped of the wilds that
bound him,
His hands across his knees,
The needles cracking on the sward around him,
Dropped from the wilting trees.
“ When murd’ring beasts invade your peaceful
quarter,
Who kill all things that fly,
And brag about the cruel, sinful slaugther,
’Twill be for us ‘ good-bye.’
“ They’ll come along our tracks and feel the
prouder
For having bagged your sort.
And he who kills the most will yap the louder,
All in the name of sport.
“ Our ravished land, where misguided
minions
Have stalked without dispute,
Mourns for the splendor of departed pinions,
For voices that are mute.
‘ She weeps for her unborn who, by their capture,
Are made to pay the wage—
To give some ruffian one moment’s rapture—
A nation’s heritage.
“ And side by side, in their enlightened ages,
With this destroying brute,
He who collects for cases or for cages
Will stand in vile repute.
“And with them, too, the ruthless poison-layers.
Dead-strewing hill and flat,
And heartless woman who employeth slayers
To decorate her hat.
“ With these abroad, who care not what to-
morrow
For all may hold in fee,
Companions of the wand’rer, there is sorrow,
I fear, in store for thee.
“If prayers availed, or even execrations,
I’d make your lives divine,
And pass you on to far-off generations,
Dear wild-wood mates of mine.
“ But feed your fill while I have bread and
damper,
O Happy Family ! ”
And hopping round, they recompensed the camper
With their quaint minstrelsy.

EDARD S. SORENSON.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, July 31, 1909.
My Dear Thargomindah,—-
The vice-regal party is still not with us. His
Ex. bombards the flapping ducklet in the
inlands, and her Ex. chases the gleeful sand crab
on the shore of the sounding sea. But they’ll be
in town on Monday, and so will songstress Melba.
Quite an illumination of visiting talent lent
itself to the tea-fight at the Pioneer Club on
Friday. Beatrice Day. just recovered from a
bad cold and a terrific sneeze ; Mrs. Novelist
Dearden, of “Life’s Litanies’’ fame ; Mrs. John
Lemmone, and Miss Constance Hicks came along,
and the last-named lifted up a pleasing voice in a
dainty French ballad. Incidentally, she was
clothed in a pale blue satin vision. Other assisters
in a melodious waj^were Mrs. Del Walker, Miss
Mabel Moffatt and Misses O’Dwyer and Howes.
We are in sackcloth and ashes to-day—and so,
alas, is the Golf House. That pretty centre of
friendly rivalry and flurried foozlers caught alight
somewhere about 8 o’clock on Thursday night,
and in one short hour the building, together with
a hundred and one trophies and pictures, the gifts
of Lord Lamington, the Chelmsford baron, and
other lovers of the royal and ancient came were
as nothing. The loss to the club (save for the in-
convenience and upsetment of all records for the
coming tournaments) is covered by insurance; but
the male members, at all events, lose everything.
Some of the gear of the she associates was, I hear,
snatched from the general devastation. The blaze
is said to have originated in the locker of Premier
William Kidston, in which there were rats. The
writer cannot recollect any period of that clinging
politician’s recent career when there weren’t rats
following him somewhere. They are so bad now
that if you set a rat-trap in the Cabinet you ought
to be able to catch a Minister at almost any hour
of the day or night.
Mrs. Norman Armitage, of the cerulean direc-
toire garments, still lingers with us. On Friday
(the ill-luck of the day notwithstanding), she
gathered around her a party of friends at a lun-
cheon board, upon which reposed a wonderful
floral scheme of dark purple violets and pink
sweet peas. The menu matched the flowers, and
the hostess was as pleasing to look upon also as
both of them put together.
The delegates to the forthcoming Woman’s
anti-Socialist corroboree have come upon ns, and
the air is dark with threatonings to our nerve-
racked constitutions. The fair debaters do not
appear as imposing as their promised papers ; their
general aspect is of the crumpled variety, and
their hair is much in need of brushing
and dressing by other means than the hay
rake. Still there are certain pleasing excep-
tions to that unfortunate air of dilapida-
tion and birds’ nests in the hair, which so
frequently characterises the anti-Socialistic lady.
Mrs. St. Ledger, for instance, and the Melb. ex-
Mayoress Weeden, also Mrs. Kidgell look as if
they really clothed themselves ; but the average
in frockiness and good grooming is low, and is not
raised by that breezy suffragette, Miss Grace
Watson, whose garments, like her remarks, seem
put on and shot off at random. Fourteen of these
mostly untidy products of the 20th century arrived
per s.s. Wyreema ; and I am told that the Bombala,
due here at daylight on Monday, is so heavy with
delegates that it was expected to sink at any
moment, and some of the ladies had to be thrown
overboard to lighten the ship.
The feminine talking shop will open with a con-
versazione (which, being defined, is usually a
blend of the worst points of a crush, a political
meeting and a supper party, with most of the
supper missing). This cheerful mode of getting
through the evening will eventuate on Monday
next, after some of the local leaguers have bailed
up William K. heavy Appel, with a firm re-
quest to have the age of consent raised from 14 to 17.
On Tuesday the ladies will get to business proper,
interspersed with such frivols as a river picnic,
two river-sidegarden parties, a club “at home,’’and
a morning tea on the roof of the Y.M.O. A. build-
ing (which is the only portion of that sacred edifice
upon which a feminine woman may plant the sole
of her boot without a special permit). What is
left of the convention (and particularly of the
ladies of your N.S.W. rival leagues), when some
small differences have been settled, will be taken
to the show, and if that doesn’t kill them outright
they will then be collected and shipped to the
South once more.
Two new engagements have been blushfully
announced this week. The first case is that of
Miss Cecille Ulcoq and Mr. B. Potts, and the
second that of Dr. Gae and Miss McNab. Little
Miss Ulcoq is of the Dresden shepherdess type,
with fluffy hair and b'g brown eyes. Her man of
destiny is a fine sport, a good dancer and an all-
round good business man.
Some ugly rumors are beginning to blow around
touching the methods of certain railway officials
who went about among the sufferers in last
Saturday’s accident, asking them to sign com-
pensation claims for trivial amounts. It is alleged
that one individual with concussion of the brain
was got at, and would, only for the timely inter-
vention of a relative, have signed a paper he
understood absolutely nothing about. This form
of economy has its advantages. It also has the
other substance.
Re the recent want-of-confidence motion, the
full details will not be found in Hansard nor in
any other.known records. For one thing, it is
alleged that that noble majority of one was only
secured by some official holding the bar open fora
good minute after the order to close was given, so
as to give the majority time to hustle through.
The next plot for the Government’s undoing,
however, is already well under way.

THE LURE OK GOLD.—II.
BY J. D. FITZGERALD, Barrister-at-Law.
Canoona was Queensland’s first—and most bitter
—experience of a gold “rush.” It was the result
of a splendid piece of pioneering work by a man
named Capel—whose name, so far as I have been
able to discover, is not enrolled on the scroll of
our heroes of exploration. Indeed, his Christian
name is missing, and, though he had “mates”
who made up the prospecting party, they,
remain anonymous, and have not even the small
place in history devoted to the convicts who
accompanied the Leslies, nor the splendid epitaph
which Patrick Leslie left as a monument of their
faithful service. The curious little settlement of
Gladstone, which had been founded on the shores
of a splendid harbor by a band of emigrants from
Britain, dispatched the expedition. Capel’s party
won its way through the tropical forests and
the hilly country, and across the undulating
plains where now thriving settlements exist,
till it came to the Fitzroy River, which it
crossed. It left to the westward of its route
that splendid district where now the famous
Mount Morgan gold mine is yielding its millions
to the gold product of the State.
Canoona rush was the result of these explorers’;
toil, danger and daring. They found the gold—in-
deed, gold in small quantitiesmay be found overthe
, , 6 .1 ; i „
whole region they reported it, an . after a
Government test had been made, the find was
officially confirmed. Then began the rush. With
high hopes, men set out from all parts of Aus-
tralia and even Maoriland. They came by sea
and bv land ; they traversed the forest spaces,
j ~ •’ J f ,i„ j f.,„i
crossed the rivers and followed the blazed track
of Capel s men. boon Id,ooo diggers were on the
ground, tearing up the earth with feverish
anxiety, turning over and testing hundreds of
tons of likely soil. To few came any reward for
tbtdr ad venturous daring. The Canoona field was
a “patch —a rich alluvial patch which was soon
exhausted. Hardships began to fall upon the
disappointed diggers; and while hundreds were
st ju pouring in full of hope and expectancy,
hundreds were getting away as fast as they could,
disappointed of the fortunes which they had set

out to find. And those who could leave were,
lucky ; for many thousands perforce remained
behind until the Governments of N.S.W. and
Victoria chartered steamers to restore them to the
homes they had left.
But the debdcle at Canoona did not discourage
the pursuit of gold. It was but the storming of
the first entrenchments which Nature had provid-
ed. The men of Queensland were not going to be
turned back by one lost battle. They swarmed
on; and they were not
without reward, though
they did not gain a pre-
eminent reward like those
which were subsequently
won at Mount Morgan,
Gympie, and Charters
Towers. Right down the
coastal district, below the
d iscred i ted Cano o n a,
small fields were discover-
ed and exploited. ’Canal
Creek, Calliope, Rose-
wood. Caworral, Croco-
dile Creek, Morinish—
alluvial fields, with quartz
formations (to be exploit-
ed subsequently)—were
found, which again buoy-
ed up the drooping spirits
of that missionary, of
gold discovery and
national progress, the
prospector. Then came
the splendid discovery of
Gympie—a name which
stands out as a land mark
in the mineral history
of Australia. But be-
fore dealing with the
Gympie rush a word
should be said of the
missionary. The best
description of the pro-
spector which has come
under my observation is that of the late William
Henry Traill, which is worth reproducing here.
The wandering digger, in heavy inarching order, is a
familiar figure to travellers on any of Che roads and bush-
tracks of the eastern portion of the colony from Mac-
pherson’s Range toO'peYork. He is to be found also,
in quite as great numbers—probably in g'reater—off all
tracks whatever. That is to say, he could be found by
very exhaustive searching. The stockman comes across

The squatter at mustering time perceives and curses Ins
abandoned prospecting shafts, occasionally acting-as pit-
falls for cattle. On the move, the more prosperous
digger is distinguishable from the station hand on his
travels chiefly by the picks and shovels, the rusty dish,
the bellows, and litter of steel drills and so forth, which
0,1 . the pack-horse persist in thrusting themselves into
notice. But when down on his luck, the digger cannot
be niigtakell for any other sol . t of man. His pick and
shovel and his rusty dish,, for “panning out, ’’are strapped
on his swag obtrusively. No loafing “ sundowner ” would

Thus equipped and weighted with the arms of industry
and his commissariat for the campaign, and decorated
with the accoutrements of his “branch'of the service” of
human welfare, he plods along. His kit differs from that
of the mankiller in kind, but resembles it in weight. He
carries, indeed, no blacking and brushes for his boots, no
polishing paste for his buttons, but, instead, a pair of
.scales and weights for gold, and other equivalents. Like
the private soldier in the army of Republican France, who
carries in his knapsack the baton of a field-marshal, the
wandering digger rolls in his swag the bank-book of a
millionaire.
There we have, in a crystallised description, the
type of the wandering prospector. Nor has the type
died out. I have met these men within the last
five years in N.S.W., and the description fits them
to-day. They are'still doing the work of civilisa-
tion ; and, doubtless, their lives are full of all the
splendid moods, hopes,
fears, despairs and pas-
sions of the gambler ;
while their fate is
harder and happier than
his, for they have the
bush solitudes, the com-
mune with Nature, the
rough, toilsome life, the
lust of the pursuit,
and, from time to time,
the glory of success.
• To-day’ that hardy, op-
timistic brotherhood is
not extinct. They have
widened their fields. The
whole earth is theirs to
travel over and test. You
will find the Australian
prospector abroad in New
Guinea and the Fijis;
in Central Africa and
South America; in the
Malay States ; in the
islands of the Nether-
landslndia; in Klondyke
and North-west Canada,
and in Siberia. There are
no forest or mountain
silences which are sacred
from the ringing sound
of his pick, the clinking
music of his shovel. He
has driven out the fauns
and dryads and has dis-
turbed the gods of sylvan spaces in every corner of
the world.
Of this brotherhood were the two men who
began the prospecting in the Port Curtis district
before the time of Capel’s discoveries. These
men came to Gladstone from the sea in an open
boat—shipwrecked travellers who wure returning
from the gold quest in the North. They were set
to work to test the district surrounding the new
“colony” which had been established at Port
Curtis, and to which was given the name of Hug-
land’s greatest Liberal statesman. In many parts
of the district they discovered the color of gold,
and these discoveries raised the hope in the minds
of Queensland’s statesmen (she had not then a
separate existence, but was part of N.S.W.) that
the magnificent territories would be opened to the
world by some discovery of the overmastering lure
of gold which would appeal to mankind generally,
as the quieter processes and opportunities of graz-
P ursuits did , not
a PP eal - , That thought occupied the minds of those
who haci oponocl tho S6ttlBniGnt at Port Curtis,
and induced them to fit out and subsidise the ex-
pedition which Capel led, and which pioneered
the disastrous rush to Canoona.
However as the rush helned to onen nn thesnlen.
. «-O we v er, as tne rusn neipea to open up tnesplen-
dld Rockhampton District, and the Central Dis-
trict generally, it cannot be pronounced an abso-
lute failure. It was a temporary defeat; but it
bent the minds of the people to other pursuits
besides the few which were then in vogue ; and it
raised the hope which was ultimately realised :
that a vast treasure-house of mineral wealth was
lying in the soil of Queensland, awaiting future
development. To-day, notwithstanding the great
successes of the past half-century,—the great
milestones on the road of mining development—
Mount Morgan, Gympie, Charters Towers,
Ravenswood, the Palmer River —notwithstanding
the £(56,250,000 worth of gold already won, those
who are not unduly optimistic still believe that
the gold-mining industry is in its infancy. They
believe that Queensland has richer mines than
those which are now yielding such splendid
returns to their shareholders, or to the individual
miners who still seek their fortunes in the alluvial
deposits.
The charm of gold-seeking has not diminished
to-day. It is true the processes have changed ;
the nature of the search is revolutionised. The
surface in all the best known spots has been pros-
pected ; but beneath the surface there are secrets
upon the unravelling of which the geologists are
bringing the resources of science to bear. Gold-
seeking is no longer a matter of chance or of
empiricism. The great geological belts of the
State have been mapped. Capital is being ex-
pended by the State itself, as well as by private
enterprise, upon prospecting ; and from time to
time valuable discoveries are being made. The
days of the big nuggets have, perhaps, passed ;
but the days of the deep leads have to come.
When it was said that, from the miner’s point of
view, Queensland was only scratched, that repre-
sented the facts of the case from a comparative
standpoint. Fields which were formerly regarded
as “ played out” are now only looked upon as in
the process of change ; perhaps undergoing a
change in the quality of the stone, necessitating a
change of treatment; perhaps necessitating
deeper sinking, as was the case in the great
“deep leads’’ of Ballarat and Bendigo. It may
be even that the metal itself is changing, as in the
case of Mount Morgan, which the world looks
upon as the most sensational gold mine in exist-
ence, but which is also a sensationally rich copper
mine.
The wonderful development of experimental
chemistry and metallurgy which has been going
on recently has been a factor in adding to the
prospects of mining in Queensland ; for, not only
have these cheapened and simplified the processes
of winning gold ; they have also rendered mines
productive—and richly productive—which were
formerly regarded as not worth working. The
chapter on the wonderful Mount Morgan mine
will show this ; as it will also disclose some of the
wonders of the modern machinery employed in
transmuting the rich ores of the Northern State
into gold, and other metals.


Spread on Some Crackers—Not the
Slightest Injury Resulted from
Little Fellow’s Escapade —ln
Most Positive Way Ingredients of
CUTICURA PROVEN PURE
SWEET AND HARMLESS
A New York friend of Cuticura writes
the following interesting letter:
“My three year old son and heir,
after being put to bed on a trip across
the Atlantic, investigated the state-
room and located a box of graham
crackers and a box of Cuticura Oint-
ment.
“When a search was made for the
box, it was found empty and the kid
admitted that he had eaten the con-
tents of the entire box spread on the
crackers. It cured him of a bad cold
and I don’t know what else.”
No more conclusive evidence than
the above could be offered that every
ingredient of Cuticura Ointment is ab-
solutely pure, sweet and harmless. If
it may be safely eaten by a young child,
none but the most beneficial results can
be expected to attend its application to
even the tenderest skin or youngest
infant. This feeling is shared by
mothers and nurses to such an extent
that Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Oint-
ment have for many years been unhesi-
tatingly used throughout the civilized
world for preserving, purifying and
beautifying the skin, scalp, hair and
hands of infants and children from the
hour of birth. And greater still, if
possible, is the confidence reposed in
Cuticura Remedies for the treatment of
torturing and disfiguring humours of the
skin and scalp. The suffering which
they have thus alleviated among the
young and the comfort they have af-
forded worn-out and worried parents
have led to their adoption in countless
homes as priceless agents in the speedy,
permanent, safe and economical treat-
ment of infantile and birth humours, ec-
zemas, rashes, irritations, inflamma-
tions and chafings, and other itching,
scaly and pimply humours when all other
remedies suitable for children fail.

The Oriental Timber Co. is having no luck. It
was formed in Sydney and Melbourne to work big timber
concessions in Siberia ; the idea was to bring down the
pine logs, get them in duty free, and then slice them up
at Geelong (Vic.). There was no end of delay' over the
concession, to start with ; and while this barneying was
taking place, the co. was missing a splendid market.
Then, when all was ready', a gale came along and blew
the co.’s first consignment of logs all over Port Phillip
Bay. After that another wind struck the co.’s new build-
ing and spilt it over the landscape, killing two men and
injuring others in the process. And the other day a
fresh breeze lifted the roof off the machinery building and
spread it upon the railway track, and one of Tail’s trains
came along and flattened it out to about threepence.
Still, even if the Oriental Timber Co. isn’t doing much
good, there are some people who apparently are doing
worse. At any rate, two or three hundred timber-getters,
mill-hands, etc., in the Huon district of Tasmania have
just been paid off, because the bosses say' they' simply can
no longer compete against concerns—like the Oriental
Co.—which import pine logs free of duty, and merely cut
them up in Australia.

The Sydney Clerks’ Union, having made a good
start towards improving conditions for the city' pen-

keeper. It is now having a few words with the unions in
Victoria and Queensland ; the idea being- to organise the
station bookkeepers in the three States, and then cite a
case before the Federal Arbitration Court. As the con-
ditions of station bookkeepers are so bad that the best of
them can hardly be said to enjoy good conditions, the
prospect of an improvement should appeal mightily to
them, and their organisation should prosper. It will be
another grief for the big station-owner ; but the uprising
of the down-trodden clerk is bound to give grief to a
number of people.

It seems that the world wants more silk than it
has been getting lately', and a society has been formed at
Brisbane to promote the breeding of the worm that eats
the mulberry' and spins a blanket for himself with the
proceeds. The idea is that, as most youngsters have
some hobby, they might as well have one that pays
instead of one that costs the old man money'. One effort
of the Silk Society' will be to get together a good exhibit
at the Queensland Jubiiee Junket, including some silk

The Sydney City Council, which lately resumed
a large slice of land in order to make a new Oxford-street,
has been thinking hard over what it ought to do with the
frontages; and, finally, it decided on 50-year leases.
There wasn’t a single supporter of the ancient device of
scattering freeholds and giving the private landlord the
benefit of increasing population and unearned increment;
the only question was whether the leases should run for
30 or 50 years. To decide on the longer term was a pretty
large concession to the ancient device ; but still things
are moving the right way.

“ Harrison O. ” : I recently happened upon a

business-jobbery extant in the Land of the Potted Hogg.
Said epistle was received by certain business people out

upon any article, at so much a gross for advertising pur-
poses. The letter also requested in a calm, matter-of-fact
style that the purchaser, when ordering the goods,
should state how many storeys he would like added to the
building in the picture. The Yankees undertook to add
any number of storey's, or enlarge the structure in any-
way' desired. If the person who rented a one-storey shop
with a fourteen-feet frontage wanted to display upon his
billheads, etc., photos, of an imposing sky-scraper of
gigantic dimensions, alleged to be displace, the U.S. firm
was willing. Verily there are but few trade tricks and
business lies of which Sam is not cognisant.

“Henry Phelthatt”: The shortest and best
reference I have ever seen was this : —“To whom it may
concern : If this man asks you for a job, give him one.”
Commonwealth Consulting Raihvay Engineer,
Henry Deane, recently epitomised the botchery'which be-
gan the “ break-of-gauge” curse in Australia. In 1848
Secretary' of State, Earl Gray, in a despatch to N.S.W.
Governor Fitzroy', recommended the English “narrow”
gauge as suitable for this country. The “ narrow ” gauge
is the thing that Johnson’s rolling-stock now bumps over,
and was then so-called in contradistinction to the much
wider “broad” gauge —gaug-es ran up to 6ft. in those
days—adopted by the Great .Western (Eng-.) Railway' Co.
N.S.W. took Gray’s advice, and adopted the 4ft. SJin.
article. In 1850, however, the Sydney Railway Co.’s
engineer, Shields, recommended the Irish gauge of
sft. 3in. Next year the Imperial Government approved
of the change, and in’s2 the N.S.W. Legislative Council
made the broad gauge the legal one by enactment. Vic-
toria was told to go ahead with this gauge, and did
so. Then arrived Engineer Wallace, who barracked
so furiously for the 4ft. BAin. article that N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council did the turtle act. and (in 1854) said, in a
fresh Act, that it wanted the narrow thing, after all. A
little later, Earl Gray wrote that N.S. W. had better stick
to the sft. 3in., because if it didn’t there would be a
horrible mix-up when the inter-State lines were joined.
Thereupon, the very wobbly Council wobbled some more,
and a draft Bill was got ready to reinstate the broad
gauge. At this point the Sydney' Railway Co. rose and
remarked- that, on the strength of the Council’s last
enactment, it had ordered. 4ft. Bsin. rolling-stock,
and it wasn’t taking any more changes. While the Ma
province was wobbling around and swallowing itself in
this fashion, Victoria had been going ahead with
the sft. 3in. gauge (as N.S.W. had told it to), and it
couldn’t make any changes either. A last word for the
broad track was said in 1857 by Engineer Whitton, who
pointed out that, as the railway had then only crawled as
far as Liverpool, the cost of the change would be trifling
as compared with what the bill would amount tolateron;
but although Whitton’s argument was hammered vigor-
ously' home by Captain Martindale in a report, during the
same year, nobody seems to have been listening.
BORROW LAND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ere old Chaos ceased to reign upon an embryonic earth,
Ere the playful pterodactyl or dread dinosaur had birth,
From a large nomadic earthquake of an extra special
brand
You had borrowed power sufficient to enable you to
stand,
Maoriland!
Yes, the Borrow-Borrow fever ran its riot in your soul
Ere that geologic period to which we owe our coal
Had existence ; and to cataclysmic seizures good and
hot
You’re indebted for each geyser, thermal spring and fairy
grot,
That you’ve got!
Ages after came a reckless voyager across the blue,
Who by dint of stumbling blindly, blindly stumbled over
you.
And with old-world northern nations you were scarcely
brought in touch
Ere you cadged the name you’re known by, being in the
fever’s clutch,
From the Dutch !
Now you’re shaping, oh, my country, for a grand homeric
smash,
Through the worship of an idol, who is known as Bor-
rowed Cash ;
You are building up a nation on a base unstable, and
You are loping to Perdition at a rate that beats the band,
Maoriland !
MAORILAND.

An Explorer's Appreciation
Commander E. H. Shackleton, R.N., says,
regarding Plasmon preparations : “ We used them continually during
the National Antartic Expedition, and the Plasmon Powder was
one of the principal items of food on the Southern Sledge Journey.
Another sledging party PRACTICALLY LIVED ON PLASMON
during one journey they made."
Dr. Marshall, Medical Officer of the Expedition, states,
“Plasmon Biscuits and Plasmon Cocoa were
of Tremendous Value.”
For those undergoing physical or mental strain no food can equal Plasmon.
THE LANCET says: “Plasmon added to food increases the nutritive value
enormously."
To the strong and healthy Plasmon is unequalled as a maintaining
power. To the weak and ailing IT IS LIFE ITSELF.
PLASMON is an unequalled NERVE AND BRAIN FOOD containing
The Organic Salts and Phosphorus of Milk.

POLICY FOB THE

COMMONWEALTH
The Bulletin Office.
TO KEEP YOU SICK!
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is te
plunge into a chemist’s and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some patent
medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary relief from this they then
consult a doctpr, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the
same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken.
The same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same
result. And so on.
Oup modern medical system Is a foolish system. We practically pay
oui> doctors to keep us 111. Their prosperity depends not on our health,
BUT ON OUR SICKNESS! . . . To-day very little is known of medicine
and its use. The wisest doctor can do but little more than clear out
the system or aocelerate the action of the heart. When he has done these
thing's he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH.
Now, just study yourself for a moment. The failure or breaking down of any
organic function means that it has not strength to do its work. If there was any
nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know there
is not. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics and antidotes are POISONS, not
food. Food is needed to build up hew energy. Electricity is nerve food, nerve life.
No pain or debility can exist in a body charged with Electric Life; you can have
no WeaKness, no Inactive Parts, no Rheumatism, Indi-
gestion, Constipation or Kidney Trouble, if you fill your
body with it, because the life generated by this grand force gives health and
strength to every organ, and
dr. McLaughlin s electric

It worKs while you sleep, and generates its power constantly. It is worn as comfortably as your clothing,
adjusted in a minute, and made as strong or mild as you like by the pressure of a finger upon the regulator. With it
you can carry the current direct to the spot affected. You can get the full current at your ankles, feet, arms, shoulders,
head or any other part of your body. It has a Special Attachment for men. We have fixed a price for it which puts it
within the reach of everyone. Its^price is as low as S. l in many cases.

“ Floater ” writes
I recently saw in a Melbourne paper some sensational
references to the existence in this continent of certain
highly-educated Boers, acting as Japanese spies. These
gentlemen, it is reported, had been talking- to a lady, and
had acquainted her with the mildly astonishing fact that
they possess plans of the Melbourne and Sydney fortifi-
cations. One rather doubts the authenticity of the story,
for spies are not usually so communicative ; but that
they could take a chart of every fort interior in Australia,
if they wanted to, almost everybody knows. I, for
instance, could be a fairly successful spy. Ido not pre-
tend to any particular curiosity or to any exceptional
influence in garnering information ; but I possess a know-
ledge of the defences of the port of Melbourne that would
be deemed dangerous in any other country but easy-going,
careless Australia. I have inspected, merely as an
interested layman, every fortification in Port Phillip, ex-
cept the batteries at Point Nepean and Point Gillibrand.
I have crawled over the principal fort at Queenscliff
several times, and have learnt without any difficulty the
weight, calibre, range, etc., of all its guns ; the location
of its magazines; its systems of communication with
Point Nepean, on the other side of the bay entrance ; its
approximate peace and war strength in number of men ;
the size of the gun crews; the antiquity and deadliness
of its ammunition ; and have wound up by getting
an excellent bird’s-eye view of the complete forti-
fication from a lighthouse near by, which, I feel sure,
was expressly erected for the convenience of spies.
Then I surveyed the battery at Swan Island, and
absorbed just as many particulars about its dis-
appearing guns and lighter artillery as I did at Queens-
cliff. I have been further to the northern end of the
island, and have pored over its cable-tanks and mine
stores, and have learnt-curious things about gun-cotton
and mine-laying, besides prying, witiiout any interfer-
ence, into the entrails of the cable-laying steamer Vulcan.
This year I was down at the Heads for three or four days,
and, one morning, found myself inside the South Channel
fort. This is a small, artificial island, built on a sand
bank, and two or three miles from the nearest land. It
is, or was, supposed to be of some strategic importance,
as it guards the deepest of the bay’s two channels. Yet
within half an hour of landing I knew a heap of things
about the little place. Although I was an utter stranger
to the minute garrison, I was courteously rewarded with
illuminating answers to all my inquiries. As at Queens-
cliff and Swan Island, the guns, magazines, ammunition
hoists, etc., were all explained. I was introduced to the
searchlight mechanism ; explored portion of the under-
ground passages ; and finished up, by entering a neat,
subterranean chamber that any ambitious spy would have
given much to examine. It was a very plain little room,
and held, as its piece de resistance, a long, glass case,
containing-a complicated arrangement of brass rods and
discs. All this delicate and very expensive machinery con-
trolled minefields, so I understood, and it required no
prompting to get my. guide prattling away happily on
the intricacies of its working. Including a couple of
refreshing adjournments to the canteen, I had a de-
lightful morning, and left the islet faintly amazed at the
garrulity of the nation’s defenders. Prior to that visit I
had, as an amateur fisherman, often romped up and
down from Portsea to the Hip, and gathered from ex-
perienced toilers on the deep useful items about the
vagaries of the tides, the position of banks, the varying
depths of the West and South Channels, and so forth.
1 saw all those things—as can anybody else—without
pulling any strings, and without greasing any palms ;
and I am just wondering what would be the value of my
information to a bona-fide spy with technical knowledge.
Moreover, there are more than myself who must know
quite as much as I do, simply because our soldiers have a
criminal habit of gabbling- to any stranger without
credentials, and of exhibiting to him sundry things that
should be our most jealously protected secrets.

The Milk Foods closely approximate in composition to
human Milk, the natural and therefore best nourishment for
the young infant.
They are as easy of digestion as maternal milk, and
provide a perfect diet for the formation of firm flesh and
strong bones.
The Milk Foods are absolutely free from any noxious
germs, and hence are far superior to cow’s milk as obtained
in towns
No diarrhoea, digestive or stomach troubles need be feared
from the use of the “Alienburys" Foods.
The Milk Foods can be made in a moment, hot water
only being necessary.
The “Alienburys” Foods are so graduated as to provide
the maximum amount of nourishment that the child is able
to digest at the periods of life for which the foods are re-
spectively recommended. For the robust and delicate they
are alike suitable.

Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery
FOR COUGHS AND COLDS.
Of all the new discoveries in medical science, the most remarkable in recent years is one which
will prove invaluable to thousands of people, and which is taking 1 the place of all other
for the cure of Coughs and Colds. The preparation is called Dr. Sheldon’s
New Discovery for Coughs and Colds, and is a scientific compound of great merit.
It is most healing to the lungs and throat, and cures the cough or cold in a remarkably short
time, leaving no bad after effects. As it contains no injurious drugs of any kind, it is a perfectly
safe remedy for children, and is particularly good for croup and whooping-cough. The dose is
small and it is pleasant to take.

SUFFERED FROM BLEEDING LUNGS FOR

DR. SHELDON’S
NEW DISCOVERY.
A grateful woman writes the following letter to the
proprietors of this wonderful remedy :—
Geelong, Vic., July 12.
Sheldon Drug Company, Ltd.
Dear Sirs, —I had suffered for eighteen months with
bleeding of the lungs, and was given up by my physician,
who said I could not live longer than two days. My lungs
were bad, bleeding daily ; also I suffered terribly with pains
in the back and swellings. I saw your advertisement in
the paper for Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery for
Coughs and Colds, and procured a bottle from Mr. Nash,
the grocer. It helped me at once, and now I am entirely
cured. My lungs are as strong as anyone’s, and I have never
had any bleeding since ; in fact, I feel like a new person.
I have also given Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery to my
children at various times, and I have never had anything
from either doctors or chemists which has done me and
mine the same good. I can recommend Dr. Sheldon’s New
Discovery to all those suffering as I did.
Very gratefully yours,
49 Butamen Street, Geelong. Mrs. Elizabeth Peterson.

The Nation is Waiting!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE Nation is waiting !
The ports on the coastline, the cities and
towns,
The camps and the townships, the hills and the
downs,
The slow rivers winding past bushland and quay,
The tall, dreaming ranges that stand patiently,
Their peaks in the clouds and their feet in the sea—
Lo ! they wait for the One
Who will bring them the message, “ The March
has begun ! ”
The Nation is waiting !
Fast gripped in its silence, it longs for the Man
Who will waken its heart. Hark ! Far in the van
Hear the tramp of the World on its endless quest
In Time’s awful waste. With the light in the west
Go its hopes of a saviour. Its giant rest
By grim visions is slain ;
But with light of the morning is hope born again.
The Nation is waiting !
The music of hammers, the rumble of mills
From ends of the earth echo there in the hills ;
A soft breath of Life stirs the ripening grain
Like a sentinel’s call. But it dies again ;
The land stirs and sighs as one bound and in pain.
Oh ! how many the years
That shall crumble to dust ere the Master appears !
The Nation is waiting !
The smoke of far battles hangs low o’er the sea,
The sword is still sheathed though the babe’s at the
knee,
And the mother stares long at the fire’s red core,
As she strives to see all that lieth before,
And she shrinks at the stranger’s knock on the
door.
(The bugles are dumb,
And no ear hears the heart-stirring tap of the
drum).
The Nation is waiting!
With gold for her dower and steel for her sword,
She waiteth the Bridegroom who shall be her
lord ;
But the swift sands run low and the evening falls
And the Day, redly slain, dies far from her halls,
Where the lonely wind sighs and the nightbird
calls;
Oh ! a heritage vast
Waits for him who shall win her and claim her at
last.
The Nation is waiting !
The fields wait the plough and the seas wait the
keel,
So wake forges to life and with fire and steel
Make her ploughshares and ships and girdles
whereby
She may gird on the sword when challenges fly,
And ride to her coastline to conquer or die.
Shall the summons supreme
Go unheeded while ye in your indolence dream ?
The Nation is waiting !
Send forth the great message with trumpets hard-
blown.
Until to the sentinel stars it is known ;
Let clear notes repeat and re-echo the need
Of one to command till the Universe heed,
And he standeth forth who will steadily lead
To the Dawn far ahead.
Then the brave sound of marching shall waken the
dead.
N.s.w.
E. FRACIS.
Reinault’s Faith.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
the Tuna, of 130 tons burthen,
W V steam-crawled its way into Bulwa
harbor, Reinault went ashore with £4
13s. 7d. in his pockets, no luggage, and a big fear
in his heart. But he heard all the port gossip in
something under 15 minutes, and the fear grew,
in “Fat Cure ” advertisement language, “beauti-
fully less.’’
It is unlikely that he gave a second thought to
the smallness of his capital. The pride of strength
and big manhood ran high in him. He wrote a
letter, which left by the Tuna next day without
stamps or other postal formalities. It was
addressed to a woman in the Australian town
whence Reinault had come.
He had left there quite suddenly. When he
reached the port and boarded the Tuna at 4 a.m.,
he had not even knowledge of its destination, but
it was the only ship in port at the time, and it
sailed an hour later. By that time a town a few
miles inland was priding itself on a tragedy.
A man—a friend of Reinault’s—had been found
in that gentleman’s garden, very evidently dead,
and with a' bullet hole drilled neatly through his
temple. Reinault was not to be found at all.
But there luck stuck to him. He had come home
from a journey, had done the deed and left again,
and in the darkness neither his coming nor his
going had been noticed.
The woman to whom the letter was addressed
was his wife. When it reached her she had just
succeeded in saving her unblemished respecta-
bility with a tale of suicide which at least sounded
plausible. She carefully read and burnt her hus-
band’s rash communication, and thereafter was
measured with fortitude for those conventional
horrors known as widow’s weeds. Being fair, they
suited her, which is probably why she was enabled
to discard them so soon.
* * * *
Reinault noted the choking luxuriance of
growth which killed the commercial prospects of
the soil of this paradise into which he had so
recklessly hurled himself. Up on the outer edge
of the Tropics Nature is inclined to be even more
wilful than in the very heart of them, and the
result of this reckless prodigality of herself is
splendid chaos.
And when his eyes were grown used to the glare
of sun on white sand, and he had got over the
pounding in his head caused by the villainous
stuff they sold at the villainous hotel, Reinault
saw two ways of life clear and straight before him.
One —the proverbial ninety-and-nine would have
chosen it too —offered a lithe and docile native
wife and endless ease on the palm-fringed beach.
But Reinault was the hundredth man—in
this case anyway. The blood of the clean
white races that had gone to his making surged
sharply through his veins. The lust to conquer
that is ingrained in all full-blooded men was
strong in him, and his jaw snapped deter-
minedly as he turned from the lazy laughing
prospect —turned inland to toil and sweat and
chafe the strong white hands that had not yet
known real toil.
It took him four years, this man who had been
used to the lightness of life, to fight his way to
something dimly resembling comfort. Long
before then the white hands had become brown
and hard, the whole fine body had expanded and
grown supple, and the townsman had become a
hardy adventurer with a name for courage and
good fortune.
When luck came to Reinault under his new
name (which doesn’t matter, and therefore need
not be mentioned) the life, by its sheer brutality
of strength, still held him. And yet something
was lacking—small in its way in this land of easy
morals and complaisant women, but meaning
much to a man of Reinault’s build.
He missed the companionship of the town-bred
women to whom he had been accustomed. When
he came coastward he found the white women
fagged and listless. There was no verve in them,
and they displeased him so that the longing to
meet one who was unlike the ruck of her species
grew in him insistently. Faith in them he had
none—his wife had killed that —but the liking for
female companionship was part of his big healthy
nature.
He found her at last. Old Joe Moss had cleared
out of Sydney, leaving many complications behind
him, and had taken over the miserable hotel at
Bulwa harbor. There was gold to be bought sur-
reptitiously at Bulwa, and the tall girl who was
Joe’s daughter wore the most expensive clothes
in the island. Also she put them on better than
any of the other women did, and Reinault knew
that he had found a friend the first time her eyes
unflinchingly met his. And this publican’s
daughter carried herself like an empress. “In-
dolent insolence” was young Jack Chalmers’
description of her manner. Reinault smiled
when he saw her fine scarlet lips lift to a mocking
sneer at the designation. At such moments, the
fair, rather Teutonic, face transformed in an
instant to the pure Semitic type. The man’s
fingers thrilled at the touch of her splendidly
dressed hair, as she bent under his hand to pick
up the handkerchief that half a dozen men were
scrambling for already.
That is probably why other women disliked
her. They invariably do dislike the woman for
whom their men scramble. Fortunately the
men’s enthusiasm mostly died early, when they
discovered that she took no notice of it.
But Reinault was content. He wanted no
easily-won woman. That which is easily attained
palls even in the getting.
It took him a good while to discover the par-
ticular way to win her. It was very simple, and
woman has been partial to it since the days when
her conqueror dragged her by her tresses to his
saddle-bow and bore her off in triumph. Rein-
ault’s bravado did not run to carrying away Joe
Moss’s daughter. Instead, when he had won to
kissing her full lips by the simple process of grip-
ping her so that she could not struggle, and had
found her show no particular desire to struggle,
he must needs tell her the story of his life. What
impelled him to this he did not know.
And it was a sadder and more reflective Rein-
ault who at last came to understand that the
Jewess was for no man unless with honor. As is
usual with a man and woman, his notions of
honor were widely divergent from hers.
When he had recovered from the shock, he
sought her out to tell her reverently that she
had restored his faith in womanhood. And while
she paused before trying to tell him that circum-
stances alter cases a great deal, he enthusiastically
produced a letter he had written to his wife.
“You have shown me how harsh and unjust I
may have been,” he said. “ She may have been
innocent, and that poor devil I shot—God knows
—she may have told the truth. At least you’ve
taught me that.”
But his wife had done nothing of the kind.
She told him so, boldly, defiantly in the mad-
dened answer she returned.
She had married again, and the old town knew
her no more ; but the Post Office likes to get stray
communications off its mind, and sometimes suc-
ceeds, as in her case.
In her fear she cheapened herself mercilessly
till the man revolted at the memory of what he
had once cherished. She had no need to fear that
he would ever disturb her in her new life. More-
over she threatened to give his secret to the
Police Department if he ever communicated with
her again.
When he felt again like looking at a woman
without a shudder, and a little of his new-roused
anger against the man he had killed had died
down, he came to Bulwa to tell the Jewess what
she had desired to tell him—before he showed her
the letter for his wife. And he found her the
wife of Vanberg, the squat, bull-necked Dutch
planter.
He sickened at the knowledge, for a recollection
of a visit to Vanberg’s plantation still scared him
with a scorching shame.
“You knew the horror of the man’s character,”
he said accusingly. “You, of all people, to try
to teach me honor. You knew all about him ! ”
And she smiled as bravely as when he had come
to her with his letter, and broke the last remnant
of the faith she had restored to him with a simple
“Yes.”
Inwardly she almost cursed him for his folly.
She had only wanted to be deceived decently and
in order—to marry Reinault under his new name
without having his old history and his old wife
brought into the case. She would belong to no
man save with the semblance of honor; but
Reinault had clumsily torn the semblance away.
And when she had made up her mind to do with-
out even that he had put her on a cold pedestal
of high esteem and had left her there. And now,
when he returned and found she had fallen off he
assumed the right to be angry.
Meanwhile—well, there was Vanberg. Any
man or woman with a quaint taste for collecting
devils might well be satisfied with Vanberg.

PERMANENTLY
CURED.
A 10-Ycars’-Sufferer’s Gratitude.
Sitting’ on a damp seat or in wet clothes, high living, want of exercise,
and intemperate habits, are strong factors to consider in explaining why
piles arise. Defective and irregular action of the bowels, such as
constipation and diarrhoea, are the usual
cause of piles, but the predisposing cause is
invariably a disordered liver. It is to this
important organ that the bowels look for
support and assistance in performing their
proper functions. In the cure of this obstinate
ailment, old-fashioned purgatives, which are
apt to induce a straining of the bowels, should
be rigidly avoided. It is the special virtue of
Bile Beans that they produce a regular action,
ease the liver trouble, relieve the unnatural
pressure of the veins, and restore the blood
circulation. The tissues of the lower bowel
are toned and healed, so that bleeding is
checked, and inflammation, irritation and pain
are all ended.
“lama butcher by trade,” says Mr. W.
G-. Holden, of Kiama, N.S.W., and my
occupation necessitating me being out in
all weathers, I have at times been forced
to ride in a wet saddle. The upshot of this
was that I contracted Piles. I used to
suffer terrible agony. I tried many so-called remedies in the hope of getting rid of
them, but with scant success, and I continued suffering for ten or twelve years.
At last a friend advised me to give Bile Beans a trial, and I promised to do so,
although I had little hope of their doing me any good after my past experience.
However, I was agreeably surprised to find that the first few doses afforded me
relief such as I had not experienced for years, and, continuing the course, the Piles
were permanently banished. I can confidently recommend Bile Beans as an
undoubted cure for Piles. You have my full permission to make use of this letter
as you think proper, for the benefit of fellow sufferers.”
| Nature's Remedy—Purely Vegetable. |
By acting: directly on the
liver, Bile Beans are a speedy
cure for biliousness, head-
ache, indigestion, constipa-
tion, piles, debility, bad
blood, bad breath, loss of
appetite, and all ailments
that owe their
origin to defec-
tive liver action.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONCE more to wreathe a rhyme without a
theme;
Once more to gather roses in a dream ;
Again to sail the seas with ne’er a sail;
To tell a story true without a tale ;
To warble native wood-notes with no wood,
And to deliver goods where is no good ;
To spread a fairy feast on daily fare,
When he who should be host is otherwhere.
When fancy floats, with purpose to amuse,
Upon an unknown ocean—what accrues?
The fate of folly, very harsh and crude ;
Alas, the Muse is won that is not wooed.
Oh, hearts that beat and break—your owners’
purse !
Fill the mere shallows of my maudlin verse ;
Make them a piquant source from which may flow
A new Meander —let the meaning go.
The stream is flowing—whither will it lead ?
liomantic rills require a smiling mead ;
Mead requires honey—honey’s sickly sweet,
And what a meed should sickly sweetness meet !
fis very hot—the thought should banish sense ;
I asked the streamlet whither going, whence ;
Perhaps it trickles from the great divide
Where the Sublime and something else collide :
’Tis certain the Sublime is gone astray,
Maybe it’s flowing down Yassberra way ;
Perchance the other thing supplies the lack
Of fluid sustenance in Barren Jack.
I set me out to snuffle, say or sing
Something, or nothing, or just anything;
To dress a little chaff to pass for flour,
And so belike improve the shining hour.
That way the world is built, we chase our cares
By turning others’ chestnuts to grey hairs.
The world’s a stage, a mill, and, all for gain,
One dresses girls, another dresses grain ;
One soils a sword, another spoils a pen,
One deals out laws, another outlaws men ;
Some net the gold, while others drag the net,
Eager to coin a brother’s blood and sweat.
Talking is tedious, so another stave
To round the leaking pipe of rhyme, and save
Some lees of sense at least, if not all sound,
And so, just let another whoop go round !
First for the stave of song. Dream, people,
dream !
Let your light fancies float a-down the stream;
Go on and gather rosebuds while ye may,
You’re here to-morrow, if you’re gone to-day.
Your pessimistic piffle’s tommy-rot;
Sigh if you will, but not for what is not ;
Get in some laughter, not at others’ fault;
Furnish your attic with some Attic salt.
Laugh like a man, don’t snigger like a slut,
Don’t let your aim be the all-fired “ all but.”
This isn’t song, for every line’s a saw,
And song should soar in ether rare and raw.
t set me out to sing, oh solemn deep,
Whose restless tossing is the soul of sleep,
Why are the dreams of men so rarely blest
With any promise of eternal rest?
Oh mighty hills, and valleys deep and dark,
Are you the stokers of the vital spark ?
From your dim caverns is its wraith upborne
To join aloft the healthy breath of morn?
Sing winds and thunder, while you join the hands
Of seas and mountains, skies and underlands :
Is not this earth shaped forth to be the scene
Of grander organs than the human spleen ?
Ah me, I cannot sing : Then here’s a toast :
Here’s to the spot of earth we love the most;
Whoop for our country, whether right or wrong !
May she be strong in fight as weak in song !
N.S.W.
WAIF.
Their Benjamin.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BENJAMIN was the youngest of a
family of nine. From his earliest in-
fancy, perhaps because he was a sickly
child and needed attention more than any of the
others, the father and mother had lavished their
love and care prodigally upon him. All he did
was right in their sight. He always had his own
way, and the best of everything, and he became
sly, cruel, and overbearing with it all. There was
trouble all the time, and one by one, as soon as
ever they could go on their own, the other sons
cleared out of the paternal selection with very
little sorrow or regret.
“They’re so hasty—got no patience at all’’ —
said old Jackson after a row, at the end of which
Tom, the last of the eight, had departed on his
own. “They don’t understand Ben and make
allowances for him.”
But even when they had all gone, things didn’t
go as smoothly as they might have done.
Benjamin was always complaining about this,
that, and the other. Nothing pleased him or was
good enough for t him. So, after a time, the old
people put their heads together to see jf jthey
couldn’t do something more to please Ben.
“You see, Eliza,” said dad, “what he wants
is to settle down ; but he’s not used to going on
his own and roughing it like the rest. They can
all carve out their own paths, but Benjamin
is different. He needs a commencement made for
him. Suppose we give up the farm to him, just
keeping the right to a room, of course, and enough
to live on.”
In the end, after much more cogitation, they
did so upon the occasion of Benjamin’s twenty-
first birthday. Ben took the gift calmly.
“It isn’t any great shakes,” he said indiffer-
ently, glancing about with his little, red, round
eyes on the acres Jackson and the rest of the
family had reclaimed years before from primeval
bush. “Too far away from the railway for it
ever to come to much. Why, if the whole con-
cern were sold up to-morrow, it wouldn’t fetch
much, and there’s you two to keep for goodness
knows how long.”
“ But we don’t eat much,” said the mother,
laughing tremulously.
“And, of course, I’m not on the shelf yet quite.
I’ll be able to look after things a bit for you,” put
in the father briskly.
“ Oh, I suppose it will be all right as long as
you don’t get bedridden or anything,” said Ben-
jamin more graciously.
A few weeks after that, when Benjamin had got
things fairly into his own hands, he went up to
town holiday-making for a fortnight or so, and
when he came back he was not alone. The
mother’s heart gave a great jump as she watched
the trap come up to the sliprails. Benjamin had
brought home a wife, a dazzlesome sort of woman
with a mountain of luggage.
“Why, she’s a lady!" murmured the mother
innocently. “ Oh, but she doesn’t look the sort
to make our Benjamin happy at all,” she almost
cried with dismay.
“Here, someone!” shouted Benjamin, who
looked in a bad humor. “ Have you all gone to
sleep ? What’s the use of keeping a lot of hungry
relations if they’re not around when they’re
wanted ? ”
* * * *
The new wife, who had been barmaid in a city
hotel before she married, only took two days to
decide that the farm was a very slow place. Also
the parents’ blind adoration of Benjamin got on
her nerves, but that was excusable. She had no
delusions herself about the noble character of
Benjamin. So, the third morning, she spoke to
her husband, at their late breakfast.
“ It wouldn’t be a bad plan, Ben, if your parents
went and stayed for a while with some of your
brothers and sisters. You are the youngest; why
should you have to keep them always? Besides,
young married people should always have the
house to themselves.”
“By Jove!” said Benjamin, admiringly.
“You have got a head. I was just wondering
what to do with them. You haven’t seen John
for ages, dad !” —he turned to his father, who
had pottered in for something.
“Oh, the old vyoman and I don’t feel on for
visiting now, thank you,” said old Jackson, affect-
ing to treat the matter as a joke.
But Benjamin took care that it wasn’t a joke
long. “Look here, you know, dad, it is only fair
that they should take their turn at keeping you,
and, if you put in a month with each of them,
why, you won’t be around here again for nearly a
year.”
“ But my farm ?” said dad, in bewilderment.
“Your farm, indeed,” said Benjamin’s wife.
“ It’s Ben’s now, remember. You made it all
over to him, right and tight, by deed of gift, you
know. You needn’t go this afternoon, of course,
as it’s raining ; but Ben could drive you halfway
over to-morrow morning.”
“ And it will be a jolly good change for you,”
remarked Ben. “People get stodgy staying in
the same place everlastingly.”
“But, Ben,” said his mother, “this hs,s been
our home thirty years and more ; it’s hard ”
“In Heaven’s name what is all the fuss about,”
said Benjamin, irritably. “You haven’t got to
go until to-morrow, have you ?”
A couple of hours later, the parents slipped
away from the farm and started to walk the six
long, weary, wet miles to John’s. Dad wouldn’t
wait until morning—he was too wild. Ma was
silently weeping, but trying to keep it from dad.
“It wasn’t our Ben’s fault,” she said at last,
excusingly. “It’s just that woman. He never
would have thought of it by himself.”
Jackson plodded on through the mud. “Yes,”
he agreed at last; “I don’t believe he’d have done
it by himself.”
They were two drenched, miserable objects by
the time they got to John’s. Besides they felt
embarrassed. How would John receive them ?
They hadn’t seen much of him since he went off
in a huff about something connected with Ben-
jamin.
The noise the dogs made on their arrival
brought John himself to the door. “Why, it’s
mother and dad.” he cried with astonished
curiosity. “ Come on in quick.” His bull-voice
brought out Mrs. John and the family.
“John, John, don’t keep them standing there
wet through? Oh, you poor things!” cried
John’s buxom wife, and in a twinkling they were
snugly having tea in front of the big kitchen fire.
They both felt too full for words. It was so
very good to be there ; everybody seemed glad to
see them, and nobody had been glad to see them
for a long while. Yet all the time their hearts
were secretly going out to Benjamin.
John and his wife were wildly indignant when
they heard why they had come, and John was
restrained with difficulty from starting out to
whale Benjamin right then.
“ It wasn’t Ben’s fault,” said the mother, wiping
away a furtive tear. “I’m sure of that. It
wasn’t Ben’s fault.”
“No, don’t blame Benjamin ; it’s all her," said
father, huskily.
So they tried to settle down quietly at John’s.
But it was easy to see, as the months passed, that
they were fretting after Benjamin. If anybody
had been away from the house, it was always,
“You didn’t happen to go by Ben’s ? ” or “ What’s
Ben’s place looking like? Did you see him?
Did he look well? Did he ask after us? ” They
always put these questions wistfully, and when
they spoke it was generally some little remi-
niscence of Benjamin.
John struggled hard not to show his feelings,
but out in the paddocks he cursed Benjamin good
and hard. And at last a day came when he
cursed specially.
For dad got a letter from Benjamin stating
that his wife had cleared out, and he hadn’t had
anything fit to eat for a long time, and they had
better come back and look after things, and he’d
let bygones be bygones.
“ But you won’t go ?” said John, indignantly.
“ Oh, but he wants us,” said the mother, look-
ing happier than she had done for months.
“ Let her go,” said dad, trying to hide his own
joyful feelings. “You have all been very good to
us, but she won’t be happy if you don’t ”
And so they went back to Benjamin. Some-
how in this world people always go back to
Benjamin.
