PUBLISHED AT SAN FRANCISCO, CAL., U.S.A.
The Argonaut publishes bright weekly letters from
New York, Paris, and London, from skilled correspondents
who .are in touch with the intense life of those great cities.
It publishes frequent letters from other points in the
old world, and from the older world of Asia come occa-
sional letters from India, China, and Japan. Its short
stories are famous throughout the world. It is hard to
describe their peculiar lingo, but an idea may be gathered
from.this, our standing injunction to our contributors:
“ Whatever you are, never be commonplace.” The re-
sult is that the Argonaut short stories have an individu-
ality of their own. The Argonaut endeavors to present a
weekly review of the literary movement. Brief notes on
books, rather than lengthy reviews, together with notes
upon authors and journalists, will keep the reader well
up with the literary gossip of the day.

THE RED PAGE.
The new edition of “ Webster’s Inter-
national Dictionary ” has value for one thing
among many others—that it indefinitely
fixes the derivation of larrikin. The fixing
is much more definite in an editorial note
supplied to some of the dictionary’s clients,
which states a clear relationship with larli,
provincial English lar-r-k, or larack, to frolic
about :
Here is a quotation from “The Dialect of
•Leeds,” a book which was published in 1802, eight
vears before the word appeared in print in Mel-
bourne :
“ Larack. —To frolic.
Ybas larracking abart ower niich fur my
fancy, said of a giddy person—one always at a
frolic. ‘ Shoo larack’d abart an’ did nowt else
wal shoo wur fair grown up’—romped about, &c.
—Dial, of Leeds, 1802, p. 339.”
few years after the word appeared in print in
Melbourne, we find the word “ larrikin ” given in
a called “The Ancient Language and Dialect
?» by Dr - V ' W ‘ R Published in
1882. ihe work was written about 1880, so that
if the word were of Australian origin it would
have to have travelled to Cornwall in ten years,
and become so common there that Dr. Jago (a man
who, in the preface to his book, describes himself
as “ long descended from Cornishmen, and with a
clannish fondness for Cornish words and phrases”)
and other writers mistook it for a Cornish word.
Here is a quotation taken from his Dictionary :
“ Larrikins. Mischievous young fellows, larkers.
Mischievous larrikins who pull the young trees
down.’— The Cornish uuin. ” —F. W. P. Jago, The
Ane. Lang, and the Dial, of Cornwall, Truro, 1882
p. 205. ’
With a view to getting further light on the sub-
ject, Dr. Jago was written to, and replied as fol-
lows :
57 Ebrington-street, Plymouth, England, March
I do not think the word larrikin can
have been first used in your part of the world.
From all I can find it has been long in use in
Cornwall. A Cornish lady friend of mine, nearly
80 years of age, tells me that she has known the
name “ever since she was a girl; ” and another
friend, aged 70 years, says that he has heard the
word used so far north as Berwick, so the use of
the word is very far spread.
n Cornwall we distinguish between a “ rough*”
and a ‘ larrikin.” The latter is considered to be
rpiP uuschief, ” but this must have fun in
it. - bus it would really seem, and it is my
opinion, that larrikin is synonymous with, or
another form of the word larker, i.e., one who
lar.cs, or plays practical j'okes.
We Cornish consider larrikins as being young
fellows ready to play all sorts of tricks. Larrikins
used (not so much now) to exercise their talents in
a variety of ways in Cornwall. I will mention a
few of them, thus—
1. Going into a field or garden and planting the
oaPhages, turnips and small shrubs upside-down.
2. At my school in Truro, Cornwall, it was
larrikin law that every cup must have its handle
broken off when new cups were had to replace the
broken ones.
3. At Bodmin the larrikins would send the rib
of a horse, well cleaned and daintily wrapped in
silver wrapper, to any crusty or selfish old bachelor
to remind him of his duty.
And so on, for a dozen instances. Thus
the actual word, in the same sense, with an
obvious derivation, has had a lengthy Eng-
lish vogue; and to say it was invented in
Melbourne about 1879 by Sergt. Dalton or
another is absurd. Possibly some imported
Melb. policeman applied the English word
to the Australian species ; and the use
“growed,” like Topsy. The pity is that
this information was not specifically incor-
porated in Webster’s Dictionary.
All things considered, the new Webster is
about as useful an English dictionary as
exists. It cannot, of course, aspire to the
place of the New English Dictionary by the
side of the student; and it is not quite as
handy for everyday use as some less bulky
tomes the new Chambers, for example.
But it is far fuller than Chambers’s ; it sup-
ports its meanings with quotations and more
numerous illustrations ; and it is without that
narrow theological bias which disfigures all the
Chambers publications, and which in the
Chambers dictionary shades or distorts the
meaning of words like Catholic, freethinker,
to suit Presbyterian prejudice. A special
merit of the VV ebster dictionary is its appen-
dices, including a pronouncing gazetteer, a
biographical list, lists of quotations, pro-
verbs, phrases, proper names, and so on.
All these things are better sought in a dozen
separate volumes, but few people have the
space or the cash for a large reference library.
Webster’s Dictionary, with a little of every-
thing in its single volume, is particularly
fitted to be the guide and friend of the bush
Australian.
* * » *
And an extra-special merit of the new
Webster is its Australian supplement. There
is a list of local words and phrases— not com-
plete by any means, and open to many
cavils, but very helpful ; a local gazetteer
compiled by F. J. Broomfield, whose only
fault is annoying abbreviation, carried too
far ; a biographical dictionary, which is on
the whole very satisfactory ; and a local
chronology. The biographical section dis-
closes some ages during 1899

F. Rollitt complains of the lack of en-
couragement to literary aspirants in Maori-
land—
There is absolutely no Maoriland literature, and
the position of literary men here is a disgrace to
the country. In nearly every town through both
islands there are schools of art and schools of
music, and both the Government and the public
give these a fair amount of support. But neither
public nor Government give a cent to encourage
literature There are in the country several large
and excellent weekly papers, which yield consider-
able profits to their proprietors, but, to the shame
of these proprietors, they do not allow their papers
to assist m any way the literature or the literary
men of their own country. It is true that there is
now being formed a Maoriland Literary Associa-
tmn. I originated the idea myself, planned it,
and brought it before the public, but it is not re-
ceiving so much support as a new football-club
expects.
* * * *
The bald saying that only old countries can pro-
duce poets contains a certain amount of hard truth,
and applies equally to the higher class of prose
writers. Old countries offer all the prizes to
writers ; new countries offer none. A new country
does not attract the artistic or poetic temperament,
but rather men of action—settlers, traders. New
countries do not want makers of verse or of books
but makers of farms and roads. At the same
time, countries even as new as Maoriland should
encourage literature as much as music or paint-
ing. If only the commercial value appeals to the
government or the public, then both can look to
the immense markets of the old world and assist
the writers here to obtain the best prices for
novels, short stories, sketches—just as the farmer
is assisted to find buyers for his butter, cheese,
eggs.
* * * *
Maoriland is so rich in material for the writer
that it is a pity it cannot be utilised. Millions of
people will buy books that tell them of something
new, that give them fresh pictures. From the
kelp-girt shore of southern islands that sentinel
antarctic solitudes to the Auckland Peninsula,
lapt by semi-tropic seas, there are backgrounds to
fit any of them. Lonely, storm-swept rocks, shel-
tered caves, frowning cliffs, broad beaches, for
romances of sealing and whaling and wrecks and
daring voyages. Deep ravines, sombre gorges,
unclimbable mountains, to fit the thousand grand
wild untold tales of gold-digging. Log huts
within sight of pretentious mansions, rich fields
where once was swamp and forest, for stories of
pioneer settlers and man’s struggle with the wil-
derness. Harbours wind-swept and rain-washed
as Preservation and Patterson’s, sun-warmed and
sheltered as Waitemata and Whangaroa, with
cutters and ketches and broad-beamed scows for
sailors and sea-life. The barren dreariness of the
Auckland gum-fields for failures and wasted lives.
The deep swamps with their buried forests for
rich finds of resin. The tree-climbers’ camp in
the shade of giant kauris —all the quaint, strange,
wild features of this industry peculiar to northern
Maoriland. And then —richest of all, perhaps—•
Maori life, and lore. Old legends striking as
Grecian epics. Stories of heroes and heroines, of
magic and monsters, of homeric combats, self-
sacrifice, endurance, battles, sieges, and the fierce
struggles between the Maori and the Pakeha
making history dramatically sad.
* * * *
This is the material Maoriland writers have to
their hand—and more besides ; for there are the
aims and aspirations of the newest of nations, the
life-history of a people whose thoughts in the
future may influence the world. And yet with
such abundance of material, with such glorious
chances, Maoriland has no literature, and her
literary men may starve before the public or the
Government lift a finger on their behalf. Litera-
ture has greater claims for assistance than paint-
ing or music, for these things only reach limited
audiences, whilst the writer speaks to tens of
thousands for all time. The Maoriland painter or
musician can find a market for his work in his own
country ; but there is no market here for litera-
ture. It may be said that the Maoriland writer
has.the world’s markets before him. That is true ;
but the markets are a long way off, and the buyers
are not eager. Besides, there is the question
of training. A writer does not spring into being
fully fledged. He wants schooling and advice
and criticism and encouragement. He gets none
of this in Maoriland, because there is no publica-
tion which receives original matter, and no school
which teaches. If the four great weekly papers
would offer for original literary matter, say, half
as much yearly as they pay for sporting news and
fashion notes, our literary workers would have
some encouragement, and Maoriland would soon
possess a literature ; but whilst the public and the
papers are so blind and mean, the wealth of
material may lie idle and the young literary genius
may starve, and Maoriland remain disgraced as
a country tnat does nothing to encourage its own
literature.
* * * *
But—and but—and but. Some of Mr.
Rollitt’s complaint is sentimentally justified ;
but is it justified by Facts ? When the
Govt, spoon-feeds the farmer, the result can
be definitely judged and measured. If
fleece-quality is improved there is an
increase in the market - price paid for
the wool. If 100 tons of meat are ex-
ported in place of 10, there is an obvious
difference in cash receipts. But where is
the standard for spoon-fed literature ? It is
not the farmer’s standard of sales and pro-
un ’ far th ® vvorst lil; ei-ature often sells best.
Who is to judge what is worthy—especially
6( j /o e it is worthy, when the tyros are
stumbling and learning ? There is much to
be said for the British pension-system for
-proved literary merit ; but for a subsidy-
and-patronage system to the beginner of
unknown merit, is there anything at all to
urge beyond the beginner’s desire to be sub-
sidised ! Surely, surely Mr. Rollitt errs.
And does M.L. Govt, do nothing for the
literary aspirant? What of the £370,000
annually expended in free education, and
the £7OOO annually granted to Universities ?
When the sharpened tools are placed in his
hand, cannot the young author use them ?
* * * *
Mr. Rollitt speaks of Maoriland’s splendid,
unique material for literature. If the “ liter-
aiy man were as splendid and unique as his
material, would he wait for a Govt, endow-
ment before using it ? How Kipling would
smile at the idea of being subsidised by
Govt, to make his studies of Indian native
lite ! He worked because he had the im-
pulse, because he could. ; and because the re-
ward was plain in sight if he succeeded.
hen the Mabriland Kipling comes he will
need no more help than the Indian Kipling.
He will never dream of asking the Govt, to
make a market for his wares : they will make
heir own market. No teaching, no coddl-
ing, can help him. He must teach himself,
and tight with his own hand. Literature is
not to be learnt from formulae : every man
of genius creates his own formulae, and every
man of talent learns by himself how to
alter his predecessors’. Mr. Rollitt wants
to put the cart before the horse. If he and
his comrades write good stories the public is
eager to buy them. And if they write bad
stories, why should the public be taxed to
pay for them ?
* * * *
It is complained that the public prefers to
support music and painting rather than
literature. Well, if the public is built that
way it has a perfect right to do as it pleases.
-Lhe, world was Pistol’s oyster—is every
man s. He is entitled to get out of it just as
much as he can. And it is entitled to give
him just as little as it likes. That is the
hard practical Fact. And there is no ethical
or sesthetical argument as to what might,
could, would, or should be done which com-
pels the public to recede one inch from its
vantage of Fact—unless it chooses. If it
chooses to especially encourage music and
painting, it is because music and painting
seem to give it, or seem likely to give it, a
more satisfactory return. . If Maoriland
literature makes a better bid, it will get a
better price. Let Mr. Rollitt catch that
literature hare, and he may be very sure
the public will help him to cook it.
* * * t
It is somewhat alarming to find a recent
Australian whine so echoed from beyond the
Tasman sea. One hopes the local literary
person is n’t going to make a habit of it, for
he has n’t the least justification.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
There is no country in the world which
takes more interest in literature than Aus-
tralia does ; and Maoriland is quite close
enough to win under Australia’s mantle.
True ; the market for occasional verse and
prose is small and unremunerative. But no
“ literary man ” worth the name ever dreams
of contentment with “ occasional ” verse and
prose. He aims at a book, a dozen books—
some solid achievement. And if Australia
has not yet population enough to pay him
for his labour, there is London £2O away or
less. When an Australian miner can walk
from Townsville to Coolgardie for gold, an
Australian writer can easily work to Europe
for gold and fame—if the Root of the Matter
be in him. If! Anyway, the Whine is
cowardly and silly. When Mr. Micawber
came to Australia he begat far too many
descendants who wait for something to turn
up. Let the local writer go ahead and turn
up something.

w Maorilander ” writes—
N.S.W. Public Library is a gloriously managed
or mismanaged, institution, or perhaps the write
is particularly unfortunate. I inquired not long
since for a file of This Bulletin for the previous
half-year. “Not back from the binders,” though
three months had elapsed since the termination
of the period. Asked more recently for The
Bookfellow, and got three different answers from
three different assistants. First man said,
“We don’t get it;” second, when the printed
list was produced, “Couldn’t find it;” and the
third said “it had gone to the binders.” Then
only two numbers of this gigantic monthly had
been published, and the task of binding them
would surely prove too much even for the staff of
the Govt. Printing Office. And why is- it that
the English weeklies, such as t\\e Saturday, Litera-
ture, Spectator, are always—-not occasionally only
—a week or two, sometimes three weeks, later than
in the booksellers, or at other libraries ? Wanted
some copies of the appendices to the journals
of the M.L. Parliament, and am told that a gap
of several years exists in the tile. Last session's
M.L. Hansards and Parliamentary papers might
as well not have been kept at all if they are always
as incomplete and as absolutely without any sem-
blance of order as when last I called for them. As
to the newest books, I am told that the institution
is run for the convenience of a firm of'booksellers,
which may account for delays in getting books.
And, with respect to the selections—are they made
by an American that so much absolute Yankee
trash—to say nothing of ephemeral English stuff—
finds its way there, while many works of authors
who have reached the classical stage, and of others
(particularly in fiction) who are on their way there,
are left out in the cold ? But these complaints are
enough for one day’s growl.
The i npression among many frequenters
of the N.S.W. Public Library is that all new
books and magazines are retained for the
convenience of the trustees and staff, and
when these have had their weeks or months
of leisurely arm-chair perusal, students and
the public are permitted to have a look.

Since it is announced that “ Rolf Boldre-
wood ” has a new romance, dealing with
Maoriland, in preparation, the time seems
fitting to implore this ex-representative Aus-
tralian author to re-write it five times ant
put a little pith of matter and mettle o ’
style into it—if he can. It is becoming tire-
some to read notices like this in Lond.
Spectator —
Rolf Boldrewood’s” A Romanceof Canvas Town,
like much of his later work, marks a sad falling
off from Robbery under Arms , and is in great part
made up of sheep, sentimentality, and poetica
quotations.
Or this in Literature —
We learn, by the courtesy of the publisher, tnat
Mr. William S. Walker, author of “When the
Mo poke Calls, ” is an Australian and a nephew of
“Rolf Bold re wood.” The careful reviewer might
have guessed a closer relationship. The faults of
that author reappear in an aggravated form; the
construction of the sketches is clumsy, the Eng-
lish is deplorable, and the pathos is laid on with a
trowel.
And when a representative author keeps on
producing bad work he prejudices others
who row in the same bush boat. Ex uno
omnes is a fallacy which the average review-
ing mind will wot eliminate.

One of the stories in Mrs. David’s (wife of
Professor David, Sydney University) book
of Funafuti memories has for point the very
literal interpretation of the Bible by the
missionarised, Christianised, Sunday-hatted
natiyes. “A woman,” says Mrs. David,
“ was unhappy in her married life, and ap-
pealed to the native magistrate to set her
free from her husband, who ill-treated her.
The magistrate puzzled over the law as set
down in the Bible, and finally told the
woman that if she wanted to be divorced it
was necessary for her, according to Christian
law, to break the Seventh Commandment.
She did.” Mrs. David seems amused, and a
little shocked. Philosopher Nietzsche would
not have been shocked. One of the quat-
rains in his just-translated “ Poems ” runs—
THE NEW TESTAMENT.
Here the holiest book of prayers,
Weal and sorrow, see !
At its portal stands and stares
God’s adultery.
Who will write the best song, who will paint the
best picture,
Whose music is best ?
He who understands man, knows the heart of him
loves him *
Above all the rest.
Put stars in your song and put skies in your
picture,
Put mountains and seas ;
But one heart-throb that’s tuned to the heart of a
brother
Is greater than these.
What is art, what is art and the artist’s achieve-
ment,
Its purpose and plan ?
.T is the message that’s sent from the heart of the
artist
To the heart of a man
S. W. Fass.
A note from “ Steele Rudd ” —
Dear Bulletin, —You won’t hear much from
me this year; have been “off,” and ordered to
exercise vigorously—am doing so, going strong on
polo, developing a dangerous passion for the sport.
And when there is a horse to belt and bullock
about, Dad and Dave and the selection and the
roo and the Red Page can all slide -and it
won’t matter whether the ’roo swims or whether
lie don’t, or whether the woman murdered in her
bed would have been nicer butchered in the bath
or under the house. Lord, give us plenty sport,
and keep us full and merry, and never mind the
money! Poor Lawson, and that Hard-up Con-
fession of his, nearly made me sad. Would like
to have him in a spring-cart with the winkers off
the horse, just to shake those funeral services out
of Jhis bright head.

W. H.. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir, —For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “ Cum Grano Salis,” and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY:—

My dear Mr. Malyon, — August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call

my enemy is d.-feated, and I am perfectly well. I will only-

AN INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE
is a truss made on the plan of the above, with a heavy
steel or iron band, as you know if you have been in the
habit of wearing one. Throw it away ! Why will you con-
tinue wearing such an instrument of torture, when we
can furnish you a most efficient truss— Elastic —without
an iron hopp or steel spring about it, and one that may
be worn with ease and comfort both NIGHT and DAY 1
As for CURES, Dr. Pierce’s Celebrated Magnetic Elastic
Truss HAS ACCOMPLISHED THOUSANDS ! It is an
American Invention, made and sold for the past Twenty-
two years in America. It may now be had in Australia,
where it is performing most REMARKABLE CURES. It
is the only ELECTRIC TRUSS in the World ! If ruptured,
investigate at once. Call for free books, price list, &c.;
or write for same, enclosing 2d. in stamps for postage.

The Weary World!
The Weary World ! When skies were gaj
She joined the giddy dance of Day ;
Her rippling locks she backward threw,
With merry laugh she fled and flew,
A golden sprite of Mirth and May.
And then again, when skies were gray,
She left her wayward, wanton play,
To rest her slumb rous heart anew—■
The Weary World !
In starry cloak chat drooped away
The Night had wrapt the child of clay ;
And Dreams, as sweet as honey-dew,
Around a radiant freshness drew
And gently lapt her where she lay—
The Weary World !
P. LUFTIG.
Age to Youth.
“Sir, if I were young as you
(Where’s the use of wailing !);
Had such heart and lung as you,
Think you I’d be ailing
Just because a little fount
Earthward sank and left me,
Or a maid of no account
Of her lips bereft me ?”
Love is sweet,
But yet we meet
Many loves in lane and street.
“ Sir, I needs must laugh at you
(Why is youth so callow !),
Old age shakes his staff at you
For a foolish fellow :
All the world is green and gay
’Twas not made to sorrow ;
If you lose a love to-day,
Seek a love to-morrow.”
O'er the skies
A black niij lit lies,
Lawn will come and the sun arise.
“ Sir, I lift my hat to you
(If I stung you —Pardon !).
I was trifling—that to you
I mig't not unburd n ;
But her face was sweet above
All my years remember,
And your violent breath of love
Stirred an old heart-ember.”
Stars are far,
But some things are
Farther still than any star.
RODERIC QUINN.
The South Light.
If you want a taste of torture; if you’d lose the
love of life
With the wild, exultant pleasures of relief ;
If you’re wanting to experience the awfulness of
strife
And the horrifying helplessness of grief ;
Just take a trip to Sydney, and in forty hours or so
You’ll have your brain and body fully fed
With the torments and the terrors of a lifetime-
till you know
That the South-Head Light of Sydney looms
ahead.
When hope is well nigh sped,
And you wish that you were dead,
There’s a flash comes through your porthole
And you find yourself re-wed
To the joys of life instead
And the same old life you led.
Ah ! there’s something left to live for when the
South Light looms ahead.
When the boat was in the basin and you paced
the poop in pride
With a swagger chat was nautical and free,
A damsel in a deck-chair winked her wicked eye
so wide, ,
And you squeezed her as you took her down to
tea.
You were flirting in the Yarra, you were spooning
in the Bay,
You were cuddling as the vessel cleared the
Schanck:
Then your passion and your ardor faded suddenly
away, .
And you didn’t care a button if you sank.
You’ve a day and night in bed.
And a doubly bursting head—
But you ask her where she’s stopping when the
South Light rays are shed ;
And you seize the broken thread.
To repeat the things you said—
You’re a man and she’s a woman, when the South
Light looms ahead.
You don’t know where you come from ; what you’re
doing ; who you are,
As you squirm in hopeless torment in your bunk ;
And your head is throbbing wildly as the engines
jerk and jar, .
Like the sequel to a long extended drunk.
There’s a fortnight’s frolic waiting, but you neither
know nor care; . ,
You forget that ever wine ran rich and red ;
You only know that living is a curse too hard to
Till the South-Head Light of Sydney looms ahead.
Then that bright white light o erspread
On the waters brings a shred .
Of the hopes you felt in Melbourne, and the deck
again you tread.
While your thoughts leave death, instead
To the love of life they’re led ;
Ah ! there's something left to live for when the
South Light looms ahead.

The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Payette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fou-ht
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and life
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
! with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
| through the field. The son with ban-
| daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
jcatching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
I out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
j the dium. Father, son, and grandson
J had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

SATURDAY, MAY 27, 1899.
The Twenty-two-and-Sixpenny Lie.
One of the most robust and useful inaccura-
cies fathered by the Sydney Anti-Federalists
and their organ, the Datly Telegraph
(which will directly lose at least £5OOO a-year
if the present Federation scheme be accepted,
and fights against it with an utterly frantic
unscrupulousness), is the great Twenty-two-
and-Sixpennv Lie. Said lie is a short, sawn-
off screech resting on no visible evidence, to
the effect that the proposed Federal Consti-
tution, if accepted, will cost every inhabitant
of New South Wales 225. fid. per annum in
extra taxation. The average individual—the
man in the street or the bald-headed indi-
vidual at the back of the omnibus—knows so
little of finance that almost any wild perjury
of this kind will pass muster with a fair pro-
portion of the community. All that is re-
quired is that it should be said loudly and
often—that it should be incessantly shrieked
in big print—that blind leaders of the blind,
and respectable-looking gentlemen who seem
as if they had a character for accuracy to lose
even if they have it not, should say it inces-
santly with the monotonous row of an empty
tin falling eternally downhill—and even so
utterly absurd a prevarication as the Tvventy-
two-and-Sixpenny Lie can do an immense
amount of service.
There are certain circumstances under
which the acceptance of the Federal Consti-
tution now under debate would cost the Corn-
stalk people 225. 6d. per head per annum in
extra taxation, with no compensating advan-
tage. They are these :
(1) If Ihe Federal tariff, when drawn lip, is
akin to the present tariff of South Australia or Victoria—
which is possible.
(2) If New South Wales, which now imports largely
simply because it has a low tariff, «-oes on importing
quite as much or rather more under a higher tariff -
which idea the experience of the Dibbs-MacLaurin tariff
in 1892-3-4-5 has proved to he pure unadulterated rot.
(3) If New South Wales, when it, by virtue of the higher
tariff, has all this extra money to spend, doesn’t puTthe
money to any useful purpose, hut annually throws it into
the sea—if itdoesn’t useit toabolish school fees, and reduce
railway rates, and supply ihe people with roads, bridges
and railways, aud to furnish old-acre pensions, and to
wipe off the deficit, and to relieve local taxation hut is
such an incredible fool that it wastes the whole lot.
(4) And if the New South Wales workman, when cus-
toms duties are put on all imported luxuries, jroes in for
bin illy' oil-paintinys, marble statuary, ehainpayne, silks
and satins, bell-topper bats, grand pianos, organs, harps,
harmoniums, telescopes, microscopes, thermometers,
mathematical instruments, stereoscopes, locomotives
perfumed soap, seltzogenes, marble tombstones, silver
and gold plate, perfumery, jewellery, marble mantel-
pieces, and dozens of other luxuries that are utterly un-
known to him, so as to bear his full share of the new taxa-
tion
If all these things happen—then, and not
otherwise, it is possible for Federation to
cost every inhabitant of New South Wales,
poor and rich alike, about 20s. per head
annually in extra taxation. But not other-
wise. In other words, if the ruling majority
in New South Wales is going to become
hopelessly insane, then the Twenty-two-and-
Sixpenny Lie may become partly true, but
under no other conditions whatever.
* * * *
No country, when under a high tariff, im-
ports so much as it did under a low tariff,
ind New South Wales, being a plain, ordi-
nary country, governed by the same laws as
the rest of the universe, is no exception to
the rule. Therefore, when it is assumed (1)
that the tariff will be more than doubled,
and (2) that this means that the people will
pay more than twice as much as they do
now, the anti-Federal party starts by assum-
ing one thing that it isn’t sure about, and :>ne
other thing that it knows is not true. New
South Wales had a low tariff in Parkes’s
time, a high one under Dibbs, MacLaurin
and co., and a still lower one under Reid.
A.nd the amount of taxation that these
tariffs took from the people was as follows
(Coghlan s New South Wales Statistical
Register for 1898, part 1., page 20) :
1889 ... Parkes’s low tariff £1,905,883 .. P £l 15^6
J 8 - Do. 1,888,321 ... 113 9
1892 ... Dibbs’s high tariff 2,677,890 ... 2 310
1893 Do. 2,127,645 ... 114 3
1894 Do. 2,065,839 ... 112 6
„ ~ . ... at the rate of
Half of ’95 Do. 963,189 ... 1 910
~ , perannum
1897 ... Reid’s low tariff 1,280,715 .. 019 4
1898 Do. 1,256,591 ... 018 10
The odd half-year arises from the awkward
method in which the public accounts are
furnished, and the years 1891 and 1896 are
omitted because they Were transition periods
belonging partly to the high tariff and partly
to the low tariff regime. During the same
period the imports of New South Wales were
as follows :
1889 ... £22,863,057 1894 ... £15,801,941
1890 ... 22,615,004 1895 ... 15,992,415
1891 ... 25,383,397 1897 ... 21,744.350
1892 ... 20,776,526 1898 ... 24,453,560
1893 ... 18,107,035
The moral of which is this : The high Dibbs
tariff produced a greatly increased revenue
for one year only ; after that New South
Wales began to learn how to depend more
on local production and less on imports.
And when it had learned that lesson the re-
sult proved these three things: (1) New
South Wales, under a high tariff doesn’t im-
port more in proportion to population than
Victoria. (2) New South Wales, under a
high tariff, doesn’t pay more customs taxa-
tion per head than Victoria under a high
tariff. (3) Comparing the low tariff taxation
of 1898 with the high tariff taxation of the
first half of 1895, the difference wasn’t
225. 6d. per head but only 11s., and, com-
paring it with 1894, the difference wasn’t
225. 6d. but 13s. Bd. Which is bad for the
Tvventy-two-and-Sixpenny Lie.
* * * *
If the Dibbs-MacLaurin Protectionist
tariff had continuedin existence a little longer
it is quite probable that it would have shown
a still further reduction, considering that its
movement was steadily downwards. And, if
it had been a higher tariff than it was, the
chances are that it would have reduced the
volume of imports faster than it did, and the
burden of taxation would have diminished
faster. But, so far as it got, the results
were that, in 1894, New South Wales was
taxed about 2s. 3d. more per head than Vic-
toria ; in the first half of 1895 it was taxed
about 6d. per head less, both provinces being
under a Protectionist tariff. So the reason-
able inference is that if, under a uniform
Federal tariff, Victoria and South Australia
are taxed at about their present rate, New
South Wales’s customs burden will be about
£2,loo,ooo—say an increase of 11s. per head
per annum on its present outlay. Which is
again bad for the Twenty-two-and-Sixpenny
Lie.
• * » »
The New South Wales Customs-taxation
for the present financial year promises to
reach £1 per head, and the working-man
somehow doesn't seriously notice that there
is any burden at all. In that case, it is just
possible that he won’t notice the extra 11s.
either, or even that ho wouldn’t notice the
imaginary 225. 6d. if there was such a thing
which there isn’t. At all events, what the
masses have to consider is that they needn’t
pay the extra 11s. per head, per annum, or
anything like it. Though it is called 11s.
per head, it will really be £5 per head on
o I P®°P ®’ an< * or eighteenpence,
or 3d °n ° ther s. A huge proportion of it
1 be taxes oil things that are utterly
beyond the reach of the great bulk of the
people. The working-man in New South
a es is already taxed on his beer, tobacco,
spirits, biscuits, candles, currants, •jam, tea
sugar, treacle, and raisins. A tax on wheat
won t affect linn, for New South Wales has
now reached the point where it can dispense
with imported wheat, and the tax will be a
dead letter. The duties on paintings,
statuary, gold and silver plate, and hun-
dteds of other things, will never reach him,
tor lie can’t afford to revel in such luxuries at
any time. In all probability his share of the
extra customs taxation involved in Federation
wont exceed ss. per head, per annum,
vi!V e i t le , * at Man wil l pay the rest.
Which is the reason why the Fat Man in-
vented the Twenty-two-and-Sixpenny Bogey.
Ihe extra taxation incidental to Federation
will hit him a considerable shock on the
pocket, and he wants to scare the Lean Man,
by means of the Twenty-two-and-Sixpenny
Lie, into voting to reject Federation in
older that his (the Fat Man’s) pocket may
be saved.
* • • •
The extra customs taxation upon New
South Wales, with a uniform Federal tariff
something like that of Victoria, will probably
(judging by the results of the Dibbs experi-
ment) be £700,000 a year. Of that the
province, under the wise provisions of the
c !i lus . e > mu « fc get back at least
£500,000. It is for the Lean Man, who is
m the majority, to decide what will be done
with it. He may use it, if he likes, to re-
duce the Fat Man’s land-and-income tax.
Probably, however, he won’t like. He may
use part of it to abolish the 3d. a week
school-fee, which is charged for each youth-
ful member of his family—and, if he does, the
workman with four young cornstalks to pay
for will save about twice as much in this
way as he loses in extra customs taxes,
and will be a pound or two per annum in
pocket. And he may use some more to
help in starting an Old-age Pension system
whereby to keep himself out of the Benevo-
lent Asylum in his latter years; in which case,
instead of paying 225. 6d. a year extra, he
would save about Bs. of 10s. a year. Only
he would be this much better off at the Fat
Man’s expense, and the Fat Mali in his
wrath invented the Twenty-two-and-Six-
penny Fraud to scare the Thin Man from
grasping at the opportunity.
*** * '
The only plea that can be advanced against
this theory is that the smaller States—the
allegedly necessitous States—must have a
very high tariff to enable them to make ends
meet. And this plea won’t bear examina-
tion. The above calculation is based on the
theory that the Victorian tariff is adopted all
round. That tariff yields £1 10s. 2d. per
head annually, or, if customs and excise are
added together, £1 15s. lid. per head. The
latest customs and excise returns for five
provinces are :
„ .. . . Per head per annum.
South Australia £i 13 5
Victoria 1 15 n
Tasmania 2 3 11
Queensland [ 2 14 7
VVestralia ... 6 5 9
A customs tariff which yielded £1 15s. lid.
per head would satisfy New South Wales,'
Victoria, and South Australia without fur-
ther taxation, and it is this tariff which would
cost the Lean Man in New South Wales
something like ss. per annum, or less, with
the prospect of getting it all back again in
remission of school fees and in old-age pen-
sions and other advantages. Tasmania could
live on it also ; the island can raise its land-
tax from |d. to Id. in the £, and, moreover,
it had last year a gorgeous surplus equal to
nearly 11s. per inhabitant, and with nearly
11s. to spare and some resources in the way
of direct taxation to fall back upon, the re-
duction of its customs taxation by Bs. isn’t
utterly hopeless. Queensland can live on
£1 15s. lid. per inhabitant, and make up the
difference by levying land and income taxes.
And Westralia, having no land or income
taxes or probate duties, has all these possible
sources of revenue with which to fill up the
gap, if there is one ; moreover, as the Com-
monwealth offers Westralia special terms by
allowing it to retain its border-customs for
some years, it doesn’t require to come into
the calculation at present. All the wild
whoop about the fabulous amounts which it
is necessary to raise to keep the “small
States ” afloat vanishes into thin air when
the figures are carefully inspected. And the
Twenty-two-and-Sixpenny Lie goes with it.
The Spider and the Fly.
That truly awful Tory, L. F. Heydon, of the
N.S. W. House of Fossils, is carrying the
Cabbage-tree Mob’s crusade into Queensland,
and his anguished appeal to the Banana pro-
vince not to federate on any terms is pathetic.
In the congenial atmosphere of Brisbane Tele-
graph (May 15), Mr. Heydon tells the Q.
people a number of things which don’t improve
his reputation for scrupulous accuracy. He
starts by irforming them that, if they don’t
federate willingly—
You are to be coerced (into joining the Commonwealth)
by a stock-tax. We in N.S.W. were to be taught Vic-
toria's unneigh hourly ways. They thought that exclusion
of your stock from N.S.W. would constitute an “irre-
sistible attraction ” for you.
Queenslanders are hereby reminded that there
was only one N.S.W. Ministry (Dibbs’s) which
followed what Heydon, M.L.C., now calls
“ Victoria’s unneighbourly ways,” by systemati-
cally putting Protectionist duties on Queens-
land goods coming into N.S.W., and Mr.
Heydon was always understood to be a sup
porter of it. Anyhow, if the story about how
the Commonwealth proposes to make Queens-
land come in is true by accident (Mr. Hkydon
can’t know that it is true, for no man—not even
the most unscrupulous asserter going—can say
what an unborn Parliament and an uncreated
Ministry will do), what then? If Queensland
stands out, and if Mr. Hkydon’s stock-tax
theory is accurate, Queensland’s stock and its
sugar will both be handicapped in Southern
markets by heavy duties. And if Queensland
comes in there will be no stock-tax, and the
present tax on Queensland sugar will be taken
off, and Queensland will have free access to all
the Southern markets. And that kind, disin-
terested friend, L. F. Hkydon, M.L.C., asks
Queensland to stand out—and have its cattle
and sugar export industries to a great
extent ruined. If Queensland goes in for Dis-
union, as its good, unbiased friend Mr. Hkydon
implores it to do, and if the stock-tax eventu-
ates, then there will be a great boom in the
protected N.S.W. cattle industry at Queens-
land’s expense. Which seems faintly suggestive
of an axe and a big grindstone somewhere.
Whose particular tomahawk is being sharpened
in this instance ?
* * • *
More of Hkydon :
I fail to comprehend how any Queenslander can desire
to reverse the separation of 1860, and come back to be
governed by the .South.
This isn’t a plea against the present scheme of
union, but against every form of Federation
whatsoever. There can be no Federation—no
union of any kind—without reversing in some
degree, the separation of 1860. Mr. L. F.
Hkydon, who swears so persistently that he is
a pure, sincere advocate of Federation, and
merely wants to have it on equitable lines, here
inadvertently throws off his thin disguise, and
implores Queensland to go in for Disunion-at-
any-Price. The fact that Queensland will also
help to govern the South is carefully sup-
pressed.
* * * *
And again Mr. Hkydon breaks out in a fresh
place:
And 1 am not exaggerating when i say that under the
proposed federation you would be governed from Mel-
bourne. This Bill would centralise the federated area
with a vengeance. Under the proposed Bill absolutely
unlimited power of taxation is Conferred oh the Federal
Government. They have the sole right tb all custonls
and excise revenue, and unlimited eoncul-reht right tb
tax in every other form whatsoever. So that ih Brisbane
you could impose hb customs or excise duties ; and any
land or income or stamp taxes ybh imposed Could bfe
duplicated ot quadrupled by the Federal GoverHment
for their owh benefit.
The Draft Constitution distinctly says, at all
events, that the Common wealth will be governed
from some place in N.S.W. And it doesn’t
say that it will be governed from Melbourne.
It might have been governed from some
place ih only the Hkydon
push ihsisted on it being ruled from Sydney.
Moreover, the Braddon clause says emphati-
cally that the Federal Government has not the
“ sole right to all customs and excise revenue ”
—it only gives the Federal Government sole
right to one-fourth thereof, the other three-
fourths being banded back to the States. And
Mr. Hkydon, and the party to which Mr. Hkydon
belongs, know this perfectly well, and have
cursed the Braddon clause unceasingly. They
have cursed the whole Bill all over N.S.W., on
the ground that this clause is in it, and
that the measure therefore doesn’t give
the Federal Parliament sole right to the cus-
toms and excise revenue, and have incessantly
demanded the excision of Braddon’s proviso.
Thespectacleof theHKYDON push telling Queens-
land not to federate because the Constitution
Bill gives the Federal Government sole right to
the customs and excise, and asking N.S.W. to
reject the Bill because it contains a clause
which prevents the Federal Government having
that sole right, is very lovely indeed. Also, it
is very melancholy as showing how far down
decent and high-minded gentlemen can get
when the necessity for blasting the nation’s
cause urges them on.
* * • »
Also this particularly loud Jkrkmiah does
not mention that the Draft Constitution abso-
lutely decrees that taxation shall be equal
throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore
these shadowy Melbourne ghouls who are to
somehow run the whole Government (N.S.W.,
with the biggest population and the largest
vote in the Common wealth Parliament, being
such a fool of a place that it won’t count
for anything) can’t heap all the dreadful
taxation above suggested on Queensland with-
out also heaping it on themselves. And the
Melbourne people don’t like taxation any mere
than any other people.
* * * *
Also another item from the enthusiastic
appeal of the Spider to the Fly :
Under the Bill as it stands your railways and their
management and charges would be under the dictation of
a federal body, the interstate commission. But the mat-
ter is not to stop there. Victoria is already looking
ahead, and Mr. Dkakin, in the interview abovementioned,
says that one of Hie first amendments in the Bill, alter
Federation, would be to take over altogether the railways
and the debts of the States. And the financial position
would be such, indeed, as almost to compel this sur-
render, as the less of two evils. And then what would be
the position ? All railways and the debts for Iheir con-
struction being a federal affair, two consequences
would follow, namely : (1) That you could not
build any new railways in Queensland without the
consent, of your rulers in Melbourne, and (2) that
the Parliament in Melbourne could borrow and build
any railways it liked, in or out of Queensland, without
consulting you, except as one colony out of the five. You
would have a little more to say than Tasmania as to
Queensland railway construction f
As regards finance, it is provided that the Federal Par-
liament (in which the three needy southern colonies will
be a majority) can assist the needy States out of all the
Federal funds, in such manner and on such terms as that
Parliament shall think fit. You will not be one of the
poor States to be helped. And as to your rivers, you will
be restricted from irrigation by them, by Adelaide and
Melbourne, in the interest of their steamers on the Lower
Darling.
The points which Mr. L. F. Hkydon here care-
fully suppresses are many, and the ones which
he grossly misrepresents are numerous. The
Inter-State Commission is not granted any
power to interfere with the railway manage-
ment of any province, except that it may forbid
any province to charge rates upon the goods of
another province that are different from those
which it levies on its own goods. All the rest
of the story about dictation is utter rot, as
anybody can see who reads clauses IGI and 103
of the Bill. Also the Federal Government can't


take over the railways of any State, or inter-
fere in the construction of railways withm a
State, without that State’s consent And it it
takes over Queensland’s debt (the bigges
h»d to why need QugtosW
weep at losing it? Further, L. F. HfcTOON
not being God nor one of his prophets, can t tell
whether Queensland or any other province will;
or will not, some day, be one of the btatM re
quiring assistance. Also, the grief of H*- .
about “your rivers” is pathetic. In N.o.
the Heydon gang always calls thein our
rivers,” and utterly ignores and denies Queens-
land's interest in them. And even L. t.
Heydon, with all his superhuman > cheek
and his shoreless seas of assurance, can t show
the Queenslanders any clause in the federal
Bill which enables the Melbourne bogey people
to “ restrict irrigation ” in any alarming sense.
There is only one clause (No. 99) which deals
with rivers, and what it says is that the
Commonwealth shall NOT have power to limit
any State “ in the reasonable use of the waters
of rivers for conservation and irrigation.’ By
leaving out the “not,” a very terrifying spectre
can be made out of this clause.
* * • *
And once more, seeing that for Queensland
to stand out of the Commonwealth means al-
most to a certainty that its sugar will be
heavily taxed, as it is now, before it can get
into any of the other provinces; and seeing
that Mr. Heydon says it will also mean that
Queensland’s stock will be heavily taxed before
it can enter any of the other provinces ; and
considering that these two handicaps would go
a long wav to ruin Queensland; and further
considering that L. F. Heydon implores
Queensland to stay out and be ruined so far as
it can be done —well, what is L. F. Heydon’s
motive ? Who owns the axe, and who is turn-
ing the grindstone ? And what kind of game
is the Spider putting up on the Fly ? Also,
what does he suppose the Fly has been drink-
ing to induce it to fall into so palpable a trap ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Oppressed Qutlander and the
Oppressed Victorian.
They held a meeting in Melbourne, last week,
to express sympathy with the oppressed Out-
landers and their political grievances in the
Transvaal. It was a curious meeting, and the
grief of sundry heavy city magnates over these
woes in the Boer republic was harrowing to
behold. In the Transvaal any white man, even
without property, may get a vote for the Lower
House after he is naturalised and has taken the
oath of allegiance, has put in two years’ resi-
dence, and paid £2 registration-fee. These
terms look a trifle harcT, still, in return, he
becomes a full-blown second-class burgher—an
elector of the Lower House, and enjoys all the
privileges of One-man-one-vote under Oom
Paul’s beneficent Government: —
In Victoria, the same individual can grefc a fraction ot a
vote for the Lower House by being naturalised and taking
the oath, and putting in from 12 to 18 months' residence,
instead of two years. That is to say, if he is a stranger
without property, he can get from one-half to one-eightieth
of the voting-power which may be enjoyed by the fellow
with property. The Transvaai law, when it takes in the
strange voter after two years, makes him a full elector so
far as the Lower House is concerned. The Victorian law
makes him a fraction of an elector—a remnant or hit or
scrag-end—so far as its Lower House is concerned.
Then there are other wrongs suffered by the
stranger in the Transvaal. After he becomes a
free and independent citizen and a voter
for the Lower House, he may, in another
12 years, and by permission of the Upper
House, become a first-class burgher with a vote
for each House—as large a vote as that of any
other citizen—and be eligible for a seat in
either House. His children have to arrive at
this dazzling distinction in the same gradual
fashion, but his grand-children are born as
complete citizens of the Republic.
In Victoria, unless a man has property, he may wait
120 years instead of 12, and be no nearer complete citi-
zenship. Victoria not only refuses a Council vote
to the non-propertied stranger, but also to the non-
propertied Victorian. It takes the alien, even with pro-
perty, over three years to attain complete citizenship.
Only a comparatively small fraction of the people ever
reach that lofty eminence, and the average man who does
get there receive a fraction of a vote —in other words, he
gets one Council vote while the immensely Fat Man is
allowed as many as 14. And whereas the grandchildren
of the alien who becomes a Transvaal citizen start fair as
first.-class burghers, the alien who settles in Victoria or
the original Victorian himself hands down his disabilities
to his descendants for all time —while the present law
stands.
So the meeting of humorless Fat Men of Mel-
bourne expressed their grief at the extensive
disfranchisement of Upper House voters under
the Transvaal law (the number of males dis-
franchised in Victorian Council elections is
greater than the whole male population of the
Transvaal), and hoped the British Government
would interfere on behalf of these British citi-
zens who are deprived of their political rights
in Oom Paul’s Land ! And if Paulus Smit,
and Johannes Pretorius, and Hans Muller,
and a few people like them met at Pretoria and
asked the British Government to interfere on
behalf of the disfranchised citizens of Victoria,
Collins-street would be strewn with dead Fat
Men who had perished from apoplexy brought
on. by sheer rage at the presumption of Pre-
torius and Smit.

£5OOO a Year or More.
This paper, being just an ordinary red rag,
price 6d., doesn’t profess to have any super-
natural gifts in the way of thought-reading or
prophecy. So it doesn’t profess to know what
private or personal interests have caused the
Sydney Telegraph— the only remaining anti-
Federal organ of any note —to resort to such
desperate extremes of abuse and slander and
futile inaccuracy and misrepresentation, to
wreck the promising cause of Australian
nationhood. But if this paper were the Tele-
graph, and if it hadn’t any rag of conscience
worth speaking about, it would he against the
Commonwealth Bill, too, and for these reasons:
(1) The capital isn’t to he in Sydney. Therefore the
Tf.i.egrapii, like the other big morning papers which
make a speciality of Parliamentary reports, will have to
keep a special staff in the Federal city to report Parlia-
mentary debates and hunt up Government news generally.
If the capital were iti Sydney the work might be done
with the existing staff, thus saving a very heavy expense.
(2j All the Parliamentary news and debates will have

This paper doesn’t profess to know whether the
Telegraph proprietary ever even thinks of
these things. All it does know is that n it
were the Telegraph, and if it felt sufficiently
mean and low and degraded, the first four
reasons would make it lie and curse its very
hardest against every Federal scheme which
didn’t locate the capital in .Sydney, and
the fifth would make it curse something
awful against every Federal scheme whatso-
ever. At all events, when the infuriated
organ of Disunion-at-any-Price hints that
Barton and Wise and Dick O Connor are
Federalists because they hope to get some
more-or-less precarious Federal billet at,
perhaps, .£3OOO a year, it is well to remember
that the paper which suggests these things is
fighting for a dead-certain ,£5OOO a year or
more. And when it fills its columns with in-
credible fictions about the Horrors that are to
come if we federate, it should not be forgotten
that the Telegraph’s own private Horror-
wbich-is-to-Come if we federate is the loss ot
£5OOO a year, and few' people can tell the whole
truth when they have so much to lose by
it. In fact, very few people tell any shred
of the truth wdien there is a chance
to save £5OOO a year by lying. And
when the Disunion organ points out the
pure and speckless disinterestedness of its own
seedy Disunionist push, it is advisable to re-
member that it is only as disinterested as the
£5OOO a year will allow', and that there are any
number of papers which would not only sell
their country to Disunion, but to the Devil or
the Chinaman, for a great deal less than that.

More 2d. Postage Spectre.
Dr. MacLaurin on a new phase of the Federal
high postage :
I believe you will have to pay 2d. on every letter. It
will be impossible for Federation to adopt the penny
postage. We would not have the privilege of send-
ing our letters for Id. after Federation. 1 make that
statement because it would cost the Commonwealth
£350,01)0 a year to establish a uniform penny post-
age. That is the estimate of the statistician and
the postal authorities in Sydney, after making an
allowance for increased business under the lower rate.
Supporters of the Bill are reluctant to believe that it will
cost you anything, and in addition to that, they say the
Commonwealth can make Australia a present of this.
Everyone knows a penny postage cannot be established,
and as the rates must be uniform, it will cost the people
of New' South Wales £lOO,OOO.
Here the embittered Caledonian mixes tw’O
things up and tries to make them look like one.
At present, in N.S. W., Queensland, Tasmania,
and W.A., there is penny postage over a small
part of the province and twopenny postage over
the rest. At first MacLaurin said that the
Commonwealth must go in for 2d. postage all
round —that, quite as a matter of course, Vic-
toria and S. A. would impose their system on
the other four States. Now he says the same
thing a little differently :
(1) The Federal postage must be uniform (which is
true : it must be uniform throughout Australia just as it
is now’uniform throughout N.S.W.).
(2) It must be 2d. all round, or else Id. all round. For
some unexplained reason, though four provinces can
quite easily charge Id. town postage and 2d. country
postage, and five provinces used to do so, six
provinces can’t do it. It is quite impossible—Heaven
and MacLaurin only know why. MacLaurin might
as reasonably sav that, under uniform Federal post-
age it will' be impossible to charge different rates
for light and heavy letters, papers, books, and parcels,
and that, under uniform railway rates, a railw'ay-ticket
to Newtown must cost just the same as one to Melbourne.
He somehow forgets this. And having started by saying
this ridiculous absurdity the rest follows quite naturally.
The Liberal Australian Senate.
Casual prevarication in passing, by the Sydney
Telegraph (the paper which will lose £5OOO a
year or so if the Bill passes) :
The argument is often announced that the proposed
SENATE will be more liberally constituted than those of
other Federations.
It is not true. „
The German Bundesrath (or Upper House) represents
the State Governments, but NOT THE PRINCIPLE of
EQUAL REPRESENTATION. Twenty-six States have 58
members ; 17 of those 58 represent Prussia. _
The Canadian Senate consists of 81 (nominated) Sena-
tors from eight States ; and 48 of those Senators represent
the two States of Ontario and Quebec. No equal repre-
sentation there.
The Swiss “ Nationalrath,” or Upper House, is com-
posed of members chosen in direct election at the rate of
one member for everv 20,0110 souls.
The United States Senate is constituted on the Conven-
tion plan. Each State Legislature appoints two members
for six years, which is the same as having them elected
by the State voting as one electorate.
But what about the power to dissolve the Senate 7
Well, what good is that, while the small States can hold
out by re-electing the Senators while fighting for them 7
Such a specially versatile perverter as the
Sydney anti-Federal organ has hardly a right
to say that anything in this world is not true—
but that may pass. The special points in the
above tozer are these :
The Federation crowd doesn’t say that the principle of
State representation in the Upper House prevails in all
Federations; only in 14 out of 16.
In Germany the largest State (Prussia) has 17 Upper
House representatives for 32,000,000 people ; the smallest
(Schaumburg-Lippe) has one representative for 41,000.
So the latter has 46 times its arithmetically-correct share
of representat ion in the German Bundesrath. Tasmania
and W.A. will have only eight times their arithmetically-
correct share in the Australian Senate.
The statement re Switzerland is straight-out falsehood.
Switzerland's Senate is the Standerath (the Nationalrath
is the Lower House), and in the standerath every canton,
irrespective of size or population, has tw’O members.
(Anv tired person can refer to the “ Statesman s Year
Book” for 1898, pages 995 and 996.)
The equal Senatorial representation system also pre-
vails in the United States, Mexico, Chili, Argentina,
Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, Uruguay,
Venezuela, and Brazil.
If the Australian Senate, where the small States have a
lanre share of power, conies in collision with the House
of Representatives, the country doesn't depend on the
dissolution of the Senate to bring it to reason. Neither
does it depend on the dog-tax, nor on the laws for the sup-
pression of Flossies and phylloxera, nor on the regula-
tions for eradicating ticks, nor anything else equally
ridiculous and irrelevant. It will settle the business, if
necessary, at the Joint Sitting of the two Houses, where
the vote of the two states that have the majority of popu-
lation can always carry the day against the four States
which haven’t the majority.
In the United States, the Senate, in which the States
have equal representation, is supreme, because-it can’t be
dissolved, and there is no referendum, and no joint sitting
of the two Houses by which the Chamber which repre-
sents people can vote down the one which represents
states. In Australia the Senate won’t be supreme, be-
cause it can be dissolved ; and there is a joint sitting of
the two Houses in case of deadlocks, at which joint sitting
the House which represents the majority of the people
can, by its vastly superior numbers, wipe the floor with
an obstructive State House. Also, the Lower House can
refer matters to be settled by the people’s vote without
the Senate’s permission.
The awful example of the United States Senate
is a scarecrow that has seen its best days.
Under the Draft Constitution, with its joint
sitting and its popularly-elected and dissolvable
Senate, and its Referendum, the Upper House
can't boss the situation. The fact that the
non-dissolvable and not popularly-elected U.S.
Senate, with no referendum and no joint sitting,
can do so has no relation to the case, any more
than the fact that the Afghan monarch can
boil his subjects alive without trial proves that
the British monarch can do likewise. They
are both monarchs. Also the other things are
both Senates. Only they are different kinds of
monarchs and different kinds of Senates.
The Old Cat Regime.
“ A Mere Man ” to The Bulletin
Whenever neglect or callousness is alleged against any
public institution, it is fashionable to shriek for the pre-
sence of women on the committee of management. The
utter fallacy of this is nowhere better shown than at the
Melb. Women’s Hospital, where women, and women only,
rule the roost. A seat on the Women’s Hospital com-
mittee is a hall-mark of Society more precious than a
seat on the dais at Guvmentouse, and the capacity of the
board to properly and humanely manage the affairs
of an institution which has taken more than its
share of public svmpathy and cash is in inverse
ratio to its social status. The horrible bungle
of a few weeks ago, when a patient was practically
left to die on the mat, has been followed by another
act even more disgraceful. At its last meeting
this delectable aggregation of respectability and saint-
liness calmly resolved that in future all patients should
be required" to produce their marriage-certificates when
presenting themselves for admission !! One puzzled
member asked what the unmarried ones were to do, but
the only answer was in the form of a tip from another
with a bigger heart than the rest, who said, “ We’ll have
lots of borrowed ones, that’s certain.” The effect of the
decision, as understood by the general public which knows
its Women’s Hospital committee, was that unmarried
mothers were to be calmly fired into the streets, while
their offspring, if unlucky enough to live, became hope-
less cripples, and the abortionist and the infanticidist
waxed fat. Certain unfashionable persons consequently
began making impolite remarks about the inhumanity of
the committee, whereupon said committee, suddenly re-
membering the matter of Govt, subsidies and private
contributions, tumbled over itself in its eagerness to state
that it didn’t mean that at all. According to the com-
mittee’s explanation, which must be taken with a smile,
all that was needed was the certificates of the supposedly-
married applicants —the single ones could come in as
before. Great trouble, it was remarked, had been caused
by single women saying they were married-and thus
avoiding the inquisition of the committee into their
morals, in addition to fraudulently getting a ticket with
“ Mrs.” on it at the foot of their beds. The decep-
tion was not one to be any longer countenanced, said
the ultra-virtuous Women’s Hospital commit tee, and the
marriage-lines would have to be produced in future be-
fore any self-styled married woman would be admitted.
What the devil the committee has got to do with the
marital condition of any patient is a question to which
Premier Turner (as supporter of the Govt, subsidy) and
the public (as supplier of the rest of the cash) will em-
phatically demand an answer. The fashionable and
curiosity-filled committee of this hospital will have to be
summarily taught that it is there simply to manage
the institution as effectively and humanely and economi-
cally as possible, and that, whether the necessitous appli-
cant. for admission is single, married, or polyandrous is
no more its business than the rearrangement of the
ellipsis. “ Mary pity women,” indeed, when their own
sex is caring for them !
Dr. Forbes Winslow’s protest, in his recently-
published “ Mad Humanity,” against the care-
lessness with which sufferers from mental
disease are treated, is strikingly illustrated by
recent tragedies in Vic. and S.A. The patient
in that case got up early in the morning, bor-
rowed a cleaver from his nephew, and hacked
himself, his wife, and their two children to
death. From the medical evidence :
About two years ago he developed symptoms showing
organic, disease of the brain. Sometimes he became para-
lysed on the right side, and for a time lost the power of
speech. Under treatment, the paralysis rapidly cleared
off but he was not thoroughly recovered ; his speech re-
mained indistinct. After that, he occasionally consulted
witness for headache, but would not receive treatment
lon-' enough. One day last week he consulted witness,
and'there were signs of returning paralysis. In cases of
this kind symptoms of insanity might arise at any
moment.
As Winslow says, most people would rather
own up to a criminal relative than a mad one,
and so take all sorts of care to hide the fact of
the existence of the disease—with results like
these. Only in most cases we haven’t yet come
to habitually regard madness as a disease ; we
hang on to stupid old fables regarding it.
In one case at recent Melb. Sessions an old man
was charged with assault by a damsel of 15, his
employee. She admitted having returned to
work for a few days after the occurrence, and
also that she did not tell her mother till over a
fortnight afterwards. Also, the mother appar-
ently thought so little of the matter, or credited
her daughter’s word so slightly, that she laid
no complaint for over two months, having mean-
while seen accused and tried to induce him to
do something for the girl. Evidence was given
by a disinterested witness that accused was en-
cumbered with a damaged arm in a sling on
the date of the alleged occurrence, and an em-
ployee swore that 'the girl did not reach the
factory till hours after the time she dated the
matter. The accusation was characterised by
defendant as an attempt at blackmail, and the
jury, after a short consultation, duly acquitted.
At the same Sessions, an elderly woman swore
that an unknown young man called at her house
early in the morning, that she struggled with
him for six hours (!), and yet there were neigh-
bors each side and her own children in the
house. There was no corroboration of this re-
markable narrative, and Judge Hood promptly
directed the jury to acquit. This matter of the
prurient, small female and the blackmailing
woman grows tedious, but so long as the law
permits women to make unfounded charges
without fear of punishment, so long will this
sort of thing continue to disgrace the courts,
and just so long will men be subjected to ex-
pense, anxiety, and possibly wrongful convic-
tion and punishment.

Premier Reid’s classification of N.S.W. unem-
ployed is characteristic, because not original.
The same old commonplace has been repeated
for the last six hundred years, and the Laborers’
Act was passed by the English Parliament in
the 14th century to deal with the men who
“ could work and wouldn’t,” because they
couldn’t get their price. “Bluff King Hal”
and Elizabeth hanged “ masterless men.”
Premier Reid proposes to be more merciful,
and reduce them to slavery in “farms and
workshops.” Premier Reid is going to appoint
a committee, and it will not be hard to foretell
the result of its labors. It will be lound that
there are very few who can work and won’t.
Ninety-nine per cent, of those whom ordinary,
unobservant persons ciu&s under that head have
some mental or physical detect which unfits
them for ordinary labor. Leaving the dipso-
maniacs altogether out of the question, there
are, in every Australian province, thousands of
men with defective eyesight, weak hearts, ex-
citable brains, and obscure defects of other
kinds well-known to medical men, who are
quite incapable of hard work of any kind.
The large-electorate policy, which is part of
The Bulletin’s idea of a Leg. Council —the
principle, too, under which the Federal Senate
will be returned—has had a help-on as a result
of S.A. Premier Kingston’s hard fight in West
Adelaide. Kingston’s colleague is Labor-leader
Batchelor. Besides being a Labor strong-
hold, in no electorate is the R.C. influence
greater than in West Adelaide ; and the third
candidate was R.C. and no more. Consequently,
a man who stands head-and-shoulders above
every other politician in the province (with,
perhaps, a doubtful one or two exceptions), and
who any day would command far more voles in
a province-poll than any other, has been in
great danger of being absolutely left out of
Parliament—dropped between two little local
stools. And on the other side of the street a
politician whom everybody describes as a nice
old gentleman —one who shakes hands with all
his constituents and knows the number of teeth
every baby in the district has—was never for
one hour uncertain of his seat.
“F.5.D.,” concerning an important land-grab
question: —
That Sydney is destined to becotne vastly greater and
more populous than she is now seems sine. And there
is nothing' more certain also than that the inhabitants of
the great Svdnev of the future will curse the municipal
apathv and stupiditv of their predecessors who allowed
all the foreshores of her harbor to become alienated, so
that she possesses hardly a single decent water-frontage,
drive or promenade as a public possession. The tune
will come when she will have to dig deep into her purse
to redeem lands squandered and sacrificed to land-
jobbers in times gone by. But that is past. The aliena-
tion has taken place, and therewith enough. It will not
be believed, however, that North Sydney Council has
advised a still further alienation of a most iniquitous de-
scription. The case stands thus : After long litigation, a
certain Mr. Milson has failed to get possession of the
whole foreshore of Cremorne promontory, _ owing to
the salutary hundred-foot reservation. “ But," murmurs
this rich old gentleman, “think of the thousands
of pounds worth of valuable building sites I thereby
have to forfeit on thecharniiugMosraan Bay.” And he offers
to Govt. 4J acres of more-or-less unavailable land at the
end of the promontory, in exchange for the whole remain-
ing 9 acres or so of the most splendid water-frontage.
Sidney Daily Telegraph says it wouldn’t be nearly so
bad a bargain as it looks, and North Shore Council (also,
no doubt, out of purest, noblest patriotism) thinks Mr.
Milson’s offer a most worthy and disinterested.one, and
advises the exchange. Once done, the matter is irreme-
diable. Ail that I hope is that this folly (I would fain
use a harder name) should be nipped in the bud once for
all. Let the people of Sydney know what they possess in
this Cremorne promontory, and its waterside, one of the
most lovely in the world, and most accessible to their
city. If they want Mr. M.’s 4 acres, let them buy them
from him ; but, in the name of all the gods, let them not
throw away this splendid public inheritance, which a for-
tunate accident has saved out of the wreck of the public
domains. Let them, before permitting it, inquire into
the matter, and oust from power some of those who coun-
sel and permit such betrayal of the public interest.
Six members of the Amalgamated Workers’
Union, the chief Westralian goldfields’ trades
union, have been killed while at work within a
month; and this body begins to say things.
Three in particular—(l) that timbering (of drives
especially) is neglected ; (2) that the State mine-
inspection is a good deal of a farce ; (3) ditto as to
mine-accident inquests. As to the latter, the
request is made that the Association should be
represented at all enquiries. The official con-
tention is that the workmen are sufficiently repre-
sented by the mining inspector, .who always
attends ; but, as a matter of fact, since it is the
inspector’s duty to see that things are safe, he is
often naturally interested in proving they arc safe.
So the blame goes on to the dead man with
wearying regularity.
A pathetic plaint from British Papua-
written by a correspondent who “doesn't think
much of the new Governor ” :
Dear Bulletin. —I would like to get an opinion on my
four grievances doctor, ."medicine, storekeeper, and
Government. As regards tlib first, there is no .such
person on or near this goldtield (Gira, Mamba n\ er),
though there is a Govt, official who sends out bills—
medicine so much and advice so much, but he is not a
qualified man, and I understand he charges also for
medicine and advice to hospital patients (said hospital
erected by subscription and Govt, assistance), and should
like to know if he is officially authorised so to do. As
regards medicine, laudanum, in constant use here, is
sold without any name of chemist or maker. I have
drunk half a bottleful neat (size of 1/IJ4 Brown’s
chlorodvne bottle) and could not get a sleep out
of it. ' Valuable stuff, in 10 or 15-drop doses, to
save a man’s life from dysentery, eh? Also, if skin-
diseases are bad here, the ointments are worse. Any
sort of stuff put up in pots, with and without names, and
3s. to pay for as much as would go on a florin. Again, 1
have never seen such miserable tucker on any diggings,
and costing 6d. per lb. carriage for a trip ttiat can be
done by white men in six hours or less. Good opening
here for a go-ahead storekeeper, who understands diggers.
It’s not the price that bothers, but the quality and
scarcity. Milk (the sick man’s life) ’and vegetables we
have not seen for months. As for Govt.— and Governor-
well, perhaps the less said the better ! Then, as to the
field itself : We are not four miles from the original rush.
There were two good gullies got here, about New Year,
that panned out about. llOoz. each for 20 claims, hut
there’s no “ fossicking ’’-ground near them. I’ve been
here about nine months, and have never made more than
tucker, and there are lots more like me. There Are about.
150 of us waiting for a new rush, and 30 per cent,
sick—some with a disease which has killed many, hut
which we don’t understand. Swelling in feet, legs, and
stomach, arid flesh goes doughy, so as to retain a finger-
mark for some time. If any of your medical readers can
give this complaint a name, and cure, he will confer a
hoon upon us poor far-away wretches.— Digger Forlorn

The Liars ” is the Broughs’ latest play.
Without intending to be moral, it seems to be
working off a theory that came in
with Moses on Mt. Sinai about leaving the wife
of the other man alone. Unfortunately for every-
one who wants to be converted, the theory is put
into the mouth of a happy little man who is going
to marry the pretty widow of an old friend. He
works off yards of long-winded eloquence against
men who love women whose husbands have not
been as thoughtful as his own adored one’s, and
paints lurid pictures of the dreadful end of
people who run away with each other without
benefit of clergy. If the aforesaid woman hadn’t
been a widow at the time of the play the argu-
ments might have impressed somebody. Apart
from these speeches, which fall from Brough’s
lips for the most part, the play concerns
itself cleverly with a thin plot about a mar-
ried woman who dined away from home with
another man. Her husband’s brother wanders in
accidentally, exclaims, “George shall know of
this ! and rushes off to let George know. As a
rule, the tale-bearing biz. is committed to an ugly
sister, or a cousin, or an aunt. It is a novelty to
see the big brother with a beard telling tales on
the pretty wife. Then the married woman has to
rush out and drag in all the Liars she can find to
prove that she was not dining there alone with the
other man, because they were there too, and by
that time the third act arrives, and the Liars all
come on together, and the play throws off its one
full, strong, satisfactory situation. Anyone who
expects to be assisted to a few new lies, or a better
way of telling old ones, will be sure to find he is
as good a liar as anybody in this play, and will
go home happy on that account. And on that
account, and because the play is a cleverly-written
one, with a few quiet, unstrained efforts, and
many peppery epigrams chiefly directed against
women, this seems likely to be the success of the
Brough season.
* ♦ * *
Mrs. Brough, as the married woman with
a husband who doesn’t understand, plays natur-
ally, and sheds real wet tears when her lover and
she are parted. It isn’t a great part, and Mrs.
Brough can fit it exactly. Brough, as the inter-
fering friend, rises as far as the playwright will
allow. He gets the long sentiments off his chest
at every opportunity, and yet he creates a sympa-
thetic interest for himself by his tender method of
handling bottles of old port, and hugging his best
girl. In Brough’s hands Sir Christopher is the
character of tne play. Lovell makes a good-
looking ha,nger-on, and anybody can see that
IS . frying all he knows to be passion-
ately m love, and he does pretty well, but there’s
a lot of old wood in Lovell that wants burning out.
Leslie Victor, as Freddy, is a thing of joy, well-
drawn and only slightly over-played ; and, as it
is LmmaTemple who marries him, and requests
him to “ subside,” the reason why any woman
married him isn’t a matter of such importance as
it might otherwise have been. George Majeroni’s
I rencli waiter is an excellent piece of acting ;
.Joseph Carne leaves the best part of himself out-
side of his stiff, unconvincing sketch of Lady
Jessicas husband ; and Miss Bessie Thompson
puts a nice finish on her slight part. Also, Wini-
fred Austin’s lady’s-maid looks as if she is taking
part m a breaking-up show ; and Miss Vara
xtennie rather plays havoc- with the pretty widow
who is going to marry Brough.
** * *
The “Three Musketeers,” which blazed
forth at Sydney Criterion on Thursday night
ought to have been the great dramatic event of
the week, and under better circumstances it cer-
tainly would have been. There being material
for several dozen dramas in Dumas’ half-ton
story Mr. Espmasse fixed on the episode of
Milady, and Anne of Austria’s diamonds, and the
gorgeous Buckingham’s infatuation, and lie has
made a very clever play out of this legend. It
doesnt follow the book closely—but then the
book branches off into so many side issues, and
wanders through such great wildernesses of
romance, that the person who followed it closely
wouldn.t get home till three o’clock next morn-
ing. The present dramatist starts with the mar-
riage of the Comte de la Fere to the siren with
i', e b^ ded a - rm ’ whioh isn,t real] y in the tale at
all. Milady, instead of scooting with two of the
Queens jewels, burgles the whole 12; and in
place of Buckingham getting them duplicated,
which is a slow and prosaic process at the best
D Artagnan recovers them in single combat with
the siren who gets a considerable part of her
clothes dragged off in the scuffle. The blood-
thirsty adventures of the four musketeers on the
road, the ambuscades, the siege of Athos in the
hotel where he drinks 300 bottles of liquor and
smashes the rest, and most of the thrilling doings
on horseback can’t be crowded in—in fact, the
only visible horse in the story is the hereditary
greeny-yellow charger of the D’Artagnan family.
Ihe story of D’Artagnan’s quarrel with Milady
has been toned down beyond recognition—Mr.
Lspmasse would have got six months if it hadn’t!
But with all these necessary deviations the
Criterion version is a very excellent one. In
particular, the downfall of Richelieu is a strong
dramatic episode. Milady comes back in
triumph with the locked box which used to
contain the diamonds that Anne of Austria
gave to her lover, and the Cardinal falls from
his usual sagacity and takes it for granted that
the jewels are inside, which they aren’t. There-

w Lives ’ ” the latesfc Bland
Holt effort at Melbourne Royal, is an original
melodrama m so far that trouble falls heavily upon
everybody except Miss Watson, as the Wicked
Stepmother. Owing to this successful interloper,
Miss Ross gets cut off with her father’s curse. Also
Albert ]S orman and Bland Holt are reduced to
selling newspapers, Mrs. Bland Holt loses her
billet as parlormaid, and the confiding Baronet is
murdered m the last act, leaving the stepmother
aforesaid to inherit the bulk of his property and
marry, again. The authors of “How London
Lives have tried to remedy the awful injustice
of their plot by putting the bad woman into
handcuffs at the finish, but seeing that she has
done nothing to go to prison for the Crown
is bound to enter a nolle prosequi after the curtain
tails, and then she will return to the marble halls
other late Baronet and rejoice over his decease.
Moreover, she will have the satisfaction of bring-
ing her unfaithful paramour, Arthur Styan, to the
gallows, which is about all that any jealous woman
can wish for. The triumph of Sin seems complete.
This is a drama without a noble-minded son in it
consequently Walter Baker is conspicuous by his
absence from the cast. Baker not being there
Miss Ross marries Albert Norman, who re-
tires from his hungry home early in the
second act and says he is going to South
Atrica on business. He makes so much
mystery about his business that he is, pro-
bably, bolting with a newer girl. Anyway, the
drama sees him no more, and there are some
reasons for suspecting that he was lost on the
voyage out, if he ever went out at all.
♦ * * 9
Norman having passed away in silence,
Bland Holt takes care of Miss Ross for the sake
of old times, because he was the man who saved
her from a watery tank when she tried to drown
her parents’ curse. In fact, Bland Holt is the
only visible hero attached to the drama, and, if he
had any money, he would take up a commanding
position all the time. Under the circumstances
he can only pawn his clothes to pay the lady’s
rent, and, although he persuades his Hebrew uncle
to advance 2s. on a hard felt hat, the transaction
brings him no glory worth mentioning. Virtue is
its own reward in “How London Lives.” Brunton
has painted some excellent pictures for this cheer-
ful tale or woe—notably the rural setting of the
watery tank and a street scene where numerous
buggies are loaded up with special editions of the
evening paper containing a full account of a ship-
wreck. Thirty people, in addition to the principals,
rush around the stage at one time or another, and
the horrors of the pawnshop will help to keep the
Royal warm until further notice.

The Triumphs of the Anglo-Saxon Race,
likewise Britannia and Her Sons, and the Forty
ihieves from Bagdad, and a great rush of
twinkling limbs in blush-rose tights, and many
° ■YYY l ' lef \ td a s h° w that is partly identical
with the I irm s last Sydney pantomime and partly
otherwise, were produced at Melbourne Princess’s
on Saturday night. Changes in the cast of
characters have happened since the Rorty Forty
depredated m the place where the anti-
I eds most do congregate. Ali Baba and other
Y’JY are not as they were in the capital city
ot the Smother Colony, but further remarks con-
cerning the Firm’s panto, must wait over until
next week, when the Queen will not have a birth-
day to disturb the publishing arrangements of this
loyal illustrated journal.

An outbreak of fine religious frenzy (a
sectarian lecture by an actor) at Melb. Alexandra
was followed by “The Sixth Commandment ” on
Saturday. The present writer is a bit shaky on
the Commandments, and has long forgotten
whether No. G was a long or a short one. Dan
Barry’s drama doesn’t carry the meaning of its
title on its troubled brow, consequently the
present scribe is not quite certain where the Law
of Moses comes in, seeing that the villains of the
piece are seldom breaking fewer than three Com-
mandments at one fell swoop. Daniel B. and the
rest of the revival made a hopeful start on Satur-
day, but tlie Alexandra of late is a mausoleum of
blighted hopes and a monument of woe. All the
same, Dan may be looked to for another stupend-
ous attraction next Saturday if the prosperity of
the Commandment relaxes in the meantime.

A new sketch, with 20 girls appertain-
ing to it, has been introduced at the Bijou,
also delightful little Lottie Moore and Bellman
are engaged on something that is either new or
much the same thing. The somersaults of
Lottie aforesaid can never grow old in any case.
Six nights a week Lottie's feet fly upward like
the sparks. There are 52 weeks in the year,
and two feet to a Lottie, and no doubt the little
lady has lost all sense of novelty in the proceed-
ing and would fain dispense with her somersault
for a while. But the inexorable gallery cries
“Over!” just as though she were a game of
cricket, and Lottie goes over like a lamb. These
remarks are by way of introduction. to the usual
weekly announcement re Cinque vail i. The King
of Jugglers is still booming at the Bijou, and the
management describes the boom as “boundless
and interminable.”

At St. George’s Hall, Dante the Great,
assisted by the phcenixian lady, and Nanko, and
the “other Jap.” (whose legs measure about 4Jins.
round the calf), continues to produce articles from
the palm of his hand in a style peculiarly his own.
Dante has already given 40 performances in Mel-
bourne, but the day when he will put the magic
supper into his portmanteau and blow himself to
another spot is, seemingly, a distant day up to
now.

One hears people complaining that melo-
dramas are all the same now as they were 20 years
ago—and yet how old-fashioned “The Harbour
Lights ” seems by comparison with Bland Holt’s
recent productions ! “The Harbour Lights ” asks
to be taken seriously, like a Famij.y Herald story.
The modern melodramas are not so foolish as to
try to appeal to the hearts of intelligent people.
They merely profess to provide entertainment for
all classes. And they do it, as a rule. Take
“When London Sleeps,” for instance. A pre-
posterous story, but a most amusing drama.
At Poverty Point.
The Salvation lass of Louise Hepner is a testimony to
that lady’s lack of observation, for no one ever saw such
demure modesty in the Harmy. The real “ lass ” holds
her cheeky face well up, flings her arms about, and
squeals in a shrill voice : “Thank you, dear friends, for
this kind collection of thruppence. God bless everybody'.
Next week Captain Squeaker will be here, and I know
you’ll like her, ’cos she’s a splendid woman, just like
meself. Some people sy I’m a feul to be out here in the
mud and nne, but I’d rather be a feul fer God than a tool
fer the devil. Halleloojer 1 ”
Poor old Foveaux, the Melbourne violinist, who has
ever lived a simple, inoffensive life, has fallen upon dire
poverty in his old age. He is now 80, has been teaching
the young idea for the past 40 years, and has turned out
some excellent players, who ought to remember him now
in his necessity. Any Bulletin readers who would ease
bran’s journey can send subscriptions to
Melbourne Age.
Cinquevalli and Dante have formed a quite warm pro-
fessional friendship in Melbourne. They like one another
and their social interests run in the same groove. They
are both anxious to have as little as possible to do with
the wine which maketh glad the heart of man at night
and enlargeth his head next morning.
Melbourne showmen smile at the amateur management
of the Castles concert. The fact of 1800 tickets, at ss.
each, for the concert of 23rd inst., being sold before the
box-plan was opened, is proof-positive that several
hundred seats could have been auctioned at fancy prices
—and it was done in the case of the Bendigo concert.
Perhaps the Melbourne management did, in a Shake-
spearian way of speaking, perceive a divided duty, and
thought it advisable to err on the conscientious side.
Bendigo has Castles in the air, and on the brain. Its
discovery ”of Amy is a perpetual delight; already it is
wondering how “ Madame Bendigoniana ” will sound.
One local paper thinks of offering prizes (of 4d. and 2U>d
-Bendigo papers always were extravagant) for a name
j’ 1 serve the new wonder and the quartz city as
Madame Melba ’ has served Nellie Armstrong and Smell-
bourne. Meantime another Castles has blossomed at the
local Chrysanthemum Show-ayounger Castles; thispaper
declines to commit itself beyond that. Her voice, a local
critic remarks, “is inclined to be contralto,” though it
isn t formed yet; still it is “ exceedingly rich and power-
ful, and augurs well.” At the conclusion of her sonas
Hon Joseph Sternberg, M.L.C., presented her with a
basket of flowers.” (Why wasn’t it buns ?)
On the morning the box-plan for the Castles concert
opened at Melb. people took up positions at 6 a.m. to
secure first application for seats.
Henrietta Watson does not look a day older than when
fast in Australia. The same charming little nose-the
sort of nose that would do well in Russia where big’ noses
ar ? K et f , rozen off - the same fine set of the head on
splendid shoulders, the same graceful, gliding walk,
bheis at present living with her sister, Elizabeth, at St.
Hilda, getting up her Miladi part for the “ Three Mus-
keteers. She does not think much of the part; but she
was born to play it. And what pair of shoulders could so
well bear inspection when marked with the Jleur-de-lys?
Two unrehearsed items gave a little extra human in-
terest to the Kmght-Ferrar farewell season in Melb In
the court-scene of “ Prisoner of Zenda,” Miss Ferrar was
sweeping grandly off the stage when a nail caught her
train. The stately Julius had to hop off his throne and
release the dress. Rapturous applause. In the last act
of Harbor Lights, when Plimmer, as Mark Helstone, is
struggling with Lena (Ada Ferrar), Nelly Mortvne, as
Mrs. Helstcne, bounced in on the strugglers and came a
regular ‘‘box of meat *’ over Plimnier’s outspread feet.
More raptures when she recovered her perpendicular.
Rcugemont, at latest, was more or less successfully lec-
turing in the English provinces.
A very remarkable feature of L. F. Hey-
don s anti-Federal appeal in the Brisbane Tele-
graph is his cry to the Banana people not to

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The N S.W. anti-Federal party has actually
contrived to find a new perjury which, for a party that
seemed to have already used up every possible untruth,
is rather remarkable. The present idea is
(1) That the Commonwealth Bill by some mistake does
not make it absolutely imperative that the excise duties,
like the customs duties, shall be uniform.
(2) That consequently the Commonwealth may let each
State run what excise duties it pleases.
(3) That N.S.W., being a drivelling lunatic and the
idiot of the Australasian family, will necessarily charge
higher excise duties than Victoria, and so its manufac-
tures will be crushed out while those of Victoria will
thrive greatly.
The two starting points of every anti-Federal argument
are _(l) That N.S.VV. is the richest, most intelligent, and
in every way most brilliant province of the group, and
therefore should dictate terms to all its neighbors ; and
(2) that it is such an unspeakable fool in every respect
that it is going to be swindled by everybody with abso-
lute impunity.

By later advices, it looks as if the miserable
cable mixed things up about the Maoriland year’s surplus
(reported last week as £274,717), and the actual surplus
for the year is now reported as £327,917, or £'399,717, or
something like that. The S.M. llerald’s Maoriland cor-
respondent states, in last Monday’s issue, that the revenue
was £5,186,428 and expenditure £4,858,511, and he cheer-
fully adds that the surplus is therefore £399,717. The
average influential paper’s arithmetic is a fearful and
wonderful thing.

The N.S.W. courts have decided that when a
shipowner is carrying provisions of any kind as cargo,
and part of the cargo goes had in transit, he is fineable
under the law which smites any person having in his
possession victuals unfit for human food. This opens up
many awful possibilities for the shipowner. He is bound
to carry provisions or else he must reject so much trade
that he may as well go out of the business altogether.
And the new reading of the law requires that he shall not
only know, by looking at the outside of the package, or
bag, or meat-tin, that the contents are not bad, but that
he must be a prophet and able to say whether they will
or will not go bad during the voyage. For it often hap-
pens that the meat-tins or other things are far down m
the hold, and they can’t be brought up on deck every day
and officially smelt to find out how they are getting on.
When once the vessel starts they have to take their chance
till it is discharged at its destination. The law also looks as
if it was loaded as regards other people. If the s.s. owner
who is only acting as carrier (it may be quite uncon-
sciously) for another man’s bad meat has that unhealthy
commodity legally “ in his possession,” then any carter,
butcher-boy, wharf proprietor, owner of a public store or
market, railway commissioner, or other person who un-
consciously stores or carries anybody’s decayed provender
is also fineable. So is the person who unknowingly pur-
chases a bad egg ; he has in his possession vittles “ unfit
for human food,” until he finds out the badness of the egg
and indignantly throws it away. And why should the
law object to the carriage of decayed food by sea or
otherwise? So long as the food is inspected and destroyed
at the landing port there is a certain joy in the know-
ledge that the owner of it has had to pay freight. The
carriage of bad food is good for trade, and helps the ship-
owner to earn his crust, and encourages the noble British
seamen. Also in this case N.S.W.— the province which
received the decayed material—thereby obtained some
excellent manure gratis, and the stuff helped to increase
the size and consequently the influence of the province.
Rigid inspection is wanted, right enough, but the griev-
ance against the shipowner seems unintelligible.

Amid all the talk of the N.S.W. taxation which
is to be “levelled up,” it may be worth while to
draw attention to one item which badly wants
levelling down. You can post a Sydney paper
from Sydney to Milparinka, or Bourke, or Armi-
dale, or Broken Hill, for nothing. You can post a
Sydney paper from Sydney to the furthest end of Aus-
tralia or Maoriland for hi. And if you post a Sydney
paper in George-street, Sydney, to an address in Pitt-
street, Sydney, the postage is id. No other province—
not even backward Westralia or Tasmania—ever struck
the wonderful idea of charging twice as much for carrying
a paper to the next street as for carrying it to the other
end of the continent.

The Bank of New South Wales publishes a
prosperous-looking balance-sheet for the half-year to 31st
March, 1899. This time its curious habit, so manifest in
recent years, of earning just about enough to pay a 9 per
cent, dividend and enough over to lend a semblance of
variety to things, though still apparent, is less appar-
ent than usual. The half-year’s profits are £88,738, and
the div. at 9 per cent, per annum absorbs £87,750. Some
previous returns compare as follows :

Quite a number of banks, nowadays, are quietly piling up
inner reserves to provide for depreciation of securities
whose gilt-edges have been somewhat frayed by rubbing
against six rough years in succession, and it looks as if
the B.N.S.W. was still doing this, and the profits
which are published were only intended to cover the divi-
dend. In that case, there are still better things to be
looked for when the process is completed.
Compared with the figures of a year ago the
B.N.S.W. shows remarkably little variation. Deposits
have decreased about £40,000 (the Sydney Telegraph,
being probably demoralised by continually building federal
arguments wherein 2) miles, added to £3 Is. 7d., make
three tons and a great increase in postage rates, anti a
dog, says-there is an improvement of about £900,000, but
that is a matter of no importance). Note circulation
shows an increase of £67,000. In most other respects
also the business exhibits an advance, and there is a
splendid cash reserve of £4,731,684, while cash and liquid
securities added together make £6,686,000 —about 26 per
cent, on all liabilities to the public. The B.N.S.W. still
holds its place as about the strongest financial rock in
Australasia, and appears like continuing to do so in-
definitely.

The West Australian Bank has altered the date
of its balance-sheet, and publishes nine months’ accounts
to 27th March, 1899. The profits, as compared with some
previous returns, are as follows :
June, 1894 . £8,387 December, 1896 .. £16,703
December, 1894 .. 9,623 June, 1897 .. 19,685
June, 1895 .. 10,315 December, 1897 .. 18,251
December, 1895 .. 10,972 June, 1898 .. 18,542
June, 1896 .. 12,284 March,’99(9months) 29,763
The profit equals £l3 4s. 7d. per cent, per annum on the
shareholders’ funds as stated in the balance-sheet (capi-
tal, £lOO,OOO ; reserve-fund, £200,000). The net amount
of profit shown is larger than at any P«g«» pen. a

venue and all the various circumstances that generally

West Australian Bank would publish an auditor's
certificate with its accounts, it might make the public feel
a little more confident that there were no mistakes in
these gaudy figures-not that auditors’ certificates count
for much • if it would report that there had been a
eoinrilete ’independent valuation of the securities and
that thev all stood at figures which kept pace with the
recent falHn vahies.it might make the public feel more
confident still. A bank which publishes no auditors cer-
tificate, and which makes larger and iarger profits as the
commercial slump grows worse, looks unusual.
As compared with the state of things a year (or
rather 15 months) ago, the West Australian Bank s note
circulation has diminished by a drop of over
one-third. Bills in circulation have fall ®" * ro ™,^
P 99 000 Deposits are reduced froin <£1,475,000 to
£1 26 9 000—a decline of about 14 per cent. Advances
hive gone down from £1,172,000 to £1,036,000 and the
reserve of coin, bullion, and State securities has fallen
from £634,000 to £576,000. It is still a splendid reserve
(40 per cent, of all liabilities to the public—about the
largest of its kind in Australasia), still the very vastness of
this cash reserve diminishes the profit-earning power of
the instltution On the other hand, the fact that a long
way more than half of the deposits bear no interest is in
its favor; still, with all allowances aild deductions, the
apparent profit-earning capacity of the bank which doesnt
publish any auditor’s certificate is remarkable The nine
months’ profit, with previous balance, leaves £47,416
available. Of this, £25,000 goes to reserve fund, making
it £2OO 000, as already mentioned —another unique featuie
about the W.A. Bank is the fact that its reserve is now
twice as large as its paid-up capital. A hi per cent
dividend (the biggest banking dividend m Australasia)
for the nine months, absorbs £13,125, and £9291 is car
ried forward. , * *
At the recent Bank of Adelaide shareholders
meeting, David Nock, who seconded the report, froze the
little gathering by flying off at a tangent to barrack for
the S.A. State Bank ; and the silence was more awful still
when he proceeded to say that its principal goodwork.was
the reduction of interest! And Mr. Nock isn t a John
Norton, either. On the contrary, he is a white-whiskered,
suave, benevolent old Wesleyan local preacher, who sat
for a brief while in the local Assembly many years ago,
and while there passed “Nock’s Act” for the str.cter
regulation of Sunday pub.-trading.

Quite a number of people felt their dignity con-
siderably bruised because Governor Beauchamp, at the
A.M.P.’s jubilee howl, mixed that society up in his speech
with English benefit clubs and friendly societies, as if it
was a sick and burial institution which met weekly at the
“Spotted Dog” public-house. And yet the Governor
was quite right in the main. The A.M.P. is a huge
workmen’s benefit society. The -average amount
of each policy in it is about £3OO, and when
allowance is made for the big policies held by
the limited wealthy class it is obvious that- the great mass
of members must be the small men with £lOO or £l5O of
insurance. The man who expects to be run over by a
truck some day, and wants to leave a little behind him
to keep the old woman from depending wholly on
washing, is the backbone of Australia’s stupendous
institution. Lots of ignorant persons write about
the A.M.P. as a tremendously bloated affair with
£15,000,000 of cash, which ought to be heavily taxed
because of its bloatedness. It is really a combination of
142,000 people, mostly with families dependent on them,
and mostly poor people with an average interest of 1108
in the funds. And it is to give absolute safety to all these
poor people that The Bulletin advocates rigid State audit
in addition to all the existing precautions. Also, it is
because of them that the justice of levying land-tax on
mutual life offices is questionable. The law says that a
man with £240 worth of land is exempt- There are thou-
sands of persons who own no land except their interest —
about £5O worth—in the A.M.P.’s property and mort-
gages. Yet they are not
An agitation against “ unnecessary Sunday
work” is being pursued simultaneously on the Westralian
and Broken Hill fields. At the latter the appeal is
mostly to the managers ; and, in fact, apart from the B.H.
Proprietary—the big mine—there is lit fie to complain about
for every concentrating-mill but the Proprietary’s is
closed on Sundays. In the West, where there isn’t any
miners’ association to carry on negotiations with the
managers, the churches have taken the organising in
hand. One typical mining-field parson, Tom Allan, has
done most of the work so far, and done it effectively.
Allan, the son of a S.A. farmer, spent some years at the
hardest sorts of manual labor, and, without being aggres-
sive, still sticks to semi-Socialistic politics.

From a loss of £3552 for the half-year ended
June 30 last the British B.H. Co. jumped to a profit of
£7792 for the half ended Dec. 31. Better and cheaper
concentrating work, slightly better metal prices, and
greater extraction of carbonate ore were responsible.
The directors are, however, commendably frank. “ The
only hope of a really great future for the co. lies in the
discovery of a process which will utilise the enormous in-
trinsic values of the residues of the British ores.” The
Cowper-Coles zinc process, which the co. has been
financing for two or three years, has not panned out suc-
eessfullv: like the Ashcroft and other processes which
appeared so satisfactory in English laboratories, “anoma-
lies have been discovered when tested on a commercial
scale.” And “no other process has come under the ob-
servation of the directors which appears to answer their
requirements.”

There are loud and long howls on the Murchison
concerning the way in which, by means of high-official
favor, certain English companies are being allowed to
dodge the labor-conditions. The Lady Forrest lias been
under exemption since Jan., 1898—If) months, and the
Gem of the Murchison since May 18, 1897—a shade under
two years ! The favor shown in exemption matters is
locally denounced as monstrous. The Murchison Advo-
cate remarks : “There is a London-owned mine within
three miles of Cue, with 20 head of stamps upon it,
which has managed to secure exemption from the labor
conditions for 25 months continuously. Whether the
fact that Darlington Simpson looms large in the forefront
of that co. has anything to do with the Warden’s leniency
is left to the public to decide. Many things are possible
for a man who utilises the Queen’s representative for
advertising purposes and drags him round the country on
the end ot a chain like a showman with a performing
bear.”

From Leonora, Westralia : —A boom predicted
here —but thought to be a year off. The town is two
miles from Sons of Gwalia, employing 160 men ; further
away are the Star of Gwalia, and the children, aunts, and
wives of Gwalia. Latter all in embryotic stage, ground just
held, not worked. Result of distance of the township—
-16 sly-grog-shops on leases and other adjuncts of civilisa-
tion! traffic openly carried on ; profits of best houses from
£3O to £4O weekly. Accessories and essentials, a moder-
ately good-looking woman and a male paramour, who
keeps discreetly dark till the whisky works. Mines pay
monthly, men get month’s pay and ciear out, leaving stores
sorrowing. Prices of food high, honest customers paying
for dishonest. Except for situation, which is one of the
best in W.A., and cheap, good water, Leonora has no
attractions. District has had sin. rain since Ist Feb.
Three wells in town, with windmills, giving good sup-
plies. Public baths, three goes daily for 2s. 6d. a week.
Sanitary state awful, flies indescribable. All stores and
hotels, with two exceptions, of mud brick. Fairly cool in
day, if ventilation right, but furnaces at night. Six Jap
brothels, each with two women and two mean whites, do
good trade ;no expenditure on plant. Japs run by syndi-
cate-managing director cycles round, orders goods, and
directs distribution to each house. One citizen rents his
front premises to Japs, and with his wife lives in bush
shed at rear. So much for morality. Mines—
O’Brien and party, a mile from town, have a
big show in the Great Boston, sampling 4oz. They
talk of its being the Sons of Gwalia lode, but that is
three miles away', and all efforts to pick up lode in
intervening country have been abject failures. Paddy
Hannan is out here, too, but has nothing so far ; sorry to
say he has done nothing since his great find—Hannan’s.
He spent two years at Menzies, then struck out west to
Mulline, north to Mt. Ida, and east to Pendinnie, without
luck anywhere. O’Brien has another show at Savannah,
where he expected 3oz. ; Govt, battery gave but 18dwt.
He says balance is in tailings, which battery boss
denies. Further out are Gold Blocks, a mine well-
proved ; battery bought out of profits. Same re
Forrest leases owned by N.S. W. boys. The Trump,
close by, has a small battery paid for out of first
sensational return lOoz. ; but visitors are not asked
to go down—shoot probably lost. North end of field held
by working parties. Bull has the south end altogether.
Govt. 10-head battery would help, but for some foolery,
over water-supply. The mismanagement of these bat-
teries is disgusting prospectors, who are being starved
out in places. Big find made 22 miles out, by Fred
Merton, who got a reward-claim. Found loth March,
and within one month crushed 15 tons for profit of £lBOO.
Said to be £20,000 in sight. Had to borrow the cash to
take up ground, paying 100 per cent, for the accommoda-
tion. Line all pegged. Sons of Gwalia is now managed
by Bewick Moreing. Said to be plenty of soz. stuff in
lowest level, but policy is to keep average at about an oz.
Stuff so soft that 10-head mill runs through 2000 tons a
month ; another 30-head coming. No timber at all
in the country. Forrest, who was up recently, says he is
going to build a railway to the field straight away, so that
the mines may get jarrah and Collie coal. Looks all
right, except for Menzies, which will lapse back into an-
other Southern Cross.
Here is another version of the Merton find, •
which, in this shape, recalls the beautiful lies of early
W.A. boom-time : “ Not so many weeks ago a prospector
named Merton, who was down on his luck, struck put
from Mt. Malcolm and fossicked round about a big out-
crop of quarlz 20 miles from the township. Scores had
been there before him, but their prospecting must have
been of the earl.v-Coolgardie kind because he at once dis-
covered what they failed to find. Merton, who knew, a
good thing when he saw it, got out a crushing of 50 tons
which went lOoz. to the ton, and as there is about half-n-
-million tons of the sa me sort in sight he reckons he is in
for the biggest thing in W.A. At any rate be is said to
have refused £300,000 for his show.” Let's see : lialf-a-
million tons of ten-ounce tack—say, £20,000,000 gross.
Sensible man to refuse a paltry 1300,000.

A promising show (says a Bulletin correspon-
dent) is Boyd’s—not Carr-Boyd, the explorer, but Jim
Boyd, a hardy old battler who tramped up from the coast
in the early days. He has two mates, one of whom (Tom
Matchett) is at present visiting Victoria. After dollying
several hundred ounces, the first crushing of 85 tons
averaged 240 z., and another parcel of same tonnage is-
about to be put through. There are several other good
shows in same locality, about midway between Cue and-
Nan nine.

Lake View Consols, W.A. : “ The yield for last
month, including contents of parcels shipped for treat-
ment, was 14,0000z.’ A great mine, undoubtedly. The
yield this month, if writer is correctly informed, will be
the record. Met a man in Melb. last week passing through
en route to Dapto smelting works in charge of 100-ton
consignment of telluride ore from this mine which had
been carefully sampled, proving its value 670 z. per ton—
-67000z. gold from 100 tons ! ! It will be followed shortly
(though probably will not come within this month’s re-
turn) bv 300 to 6 1 tons of ore worth between 20oz. and 30oz.
to the ton, also going to Dapto works. This wonderful
bonanza was struck in the 300 ft. level at the latter part of
last year, and after its richness and magnitude were fairly
established ft was barricaded, and manager Callahan left
for Port Said, or somewhere, to consult the managing
director. To this phenomenal development the great
rise in shares during the last two months is attributed.
Good business for Dapto works to secure such a parcel-
only another evidence that such well-equipped works
would command the bulk of the trade of Australia if they
occupied a better site.

On the Kayser-Bischoff subject writes “
“ F.J.E.” (29/4/’99), like many others, praises Kayser’s
method of economising water : “ were it not for the man-
ner in which the machinery is built,” etc. It neverseems
to strike anyone that if the machinery had been built in
446,814 adjacent places the water could be used over and
over again just as economically; also, when Kayser
throws it away, as it were, half-a-dozen other parties pick it
up alternately and knock a good thing out of the waste
tailings and water. Again, B. is a wet place ; rain usually
falls slowly there and continues for long periods, but some
day a whole month’s rain—of usual kind—may fall in 24
hours. Then a huge flood will come along and lots of
people will suddenly find there isn’t room for the
machinery’ and the flood in the- same gorge. Then the
shareholders will inevitably damn “ Old Kayser,” and
point out for the first time that any'praotical miner could
have worked the mine ; in fact, that there is no mining at
Bisehoff; it’s simply quarrying. Kayser gets a lot of
credit fordoing what he couldn’t help doing ; there was
no alternative. The old man was not a bad “ boss,” but
for interfering with his men when away from the mine.

From Launceston : Strange to say, no Govt, re-
port has ever been made on the Briseis or on the Derby
tin deposits. I am at a loss to know how to help you in
this matter, although I have visited the mine more than
once. The deposit is certainly enormous, but so is the
hole that has been made in it, and from this only £lOOO or
£l6OO has been distributed amongst shareholders. I un-
derstand that hitherto only one shift has been worked,
but now they are arranging to work three shifts; this,

Another slump has occurred in the hope of
Hobart, the Great Western Gridiron Railway float having
been allegedly interfered with by Premier Braddon. It
appears that the Premier lately cabled London, warning
the syndicate that it had forfeited all its concessions as far
back as last Nov. through non-compliance with the Act.
It is alleged that Braddon’s warning arrived just when
Bull was preparing to take the bait, and spoilt the after-
noon’s fishing. Though prominent railway leaguers and
syndicate agents in Ilobart characterise the Premier’s
action as “ unfriendly,” and the cable as “ brutal,” an
addendum to the message promised Govt, support in Parlia-
ment to a Bill reinstating the syndicate in its old position.
The Premier therefore seems to have only done his duty
in warning the British investor of the exact state of affairs.
But Hobart gums are gnashing in fine anti-Braddon
frenzy.

know why they did not change the management, as it was
time something was done. With a splendid price ruling
for tin they had only got 27 tons out for the year. Chair-

The South Tharsis Copper Co., Mt. Lyell,
have lately entered into a contract with the Austral Otis
Engineering Co., South Melbourne, to supply a complete
crushing and concentrating plant for treatment of their
ores, which are mostly low grade. The plant is to be a
very complete one and comprises compound steam-engine
and. boiler of 100 horse-power, 3 rock-breakers, 2 sets Roger
rolls, 8 4-compartment eccentric jiggs, 4 improved buddies
and Otis circular vanner, with the necessary trommels,
&c., for sizing and classifying the ore. The plant
has a capacity of 100 tons per day, with provision
for 200 tons. The Otis Co. are also supplying a self-acting
tramway from the mine to the mill; also, a pumping plant
to supply the mill with water from the dam.

from open cuts and that from other parts of the mine.
No. 2 smelting plant practically completed, bringing
the furnace capacity up to 1000 tons per day, and making
the general equipment one of the finest in the world.
Converters turned out in the half-year 2858 tons blister,

Gippsland Boulder, Yic. Letter from the boss :
“Recent developments in the mine indicate an early
stoppage of the battery. The stone in the winze is con-
tracting fast, and appears to be getting cut off by a floor ;
it is also much poorer than it was immediately under the
50ft. level. The stone in the stopes will not take more
tha!n three weeks to beat out, so, unless something fresh
is struck within that time, things will be more than
doubtful. I think it would be well to detain any supplies
not already on the road.” Shareholders and directors
were dumbfounded, and the market became paralysed.
“’-The Melb. management is utterly unable to account for
the tone of the manager’s letter.” Within a fortnight
two directors were on the mine, and reported Bft. of stone
.jn the winze. But why all this amazement ?—for such
things have happened before. Probably’ all on account of
the blunt, shocking way in which the truth has been re-
vealed. Had the stone altered from Sin. to Bft., the
change would have been regarded with gratifying com-
posure. If the manager’s statehnent is correct, his frank-
ness is admirable, and an example which others might
follow.

One of the most pathetic of Melbourne
spectacles is to see Mayor M’Bacharn “keeping
up Ins position ” with his robes and chain. Where-
ever he has to appear in his civic capacity he turns
up enveloped in an aggravated ’possum-rug and
with a ponderous mass of gold hanging on his
shoulders. Throughout days of 110 in the shade
Mae sits m “’possum” and chain through the
business of the City Court, a small apartment
reekingwith the odors of vagrancy ; and at every
town Hall function that ’possum-rug is an in-
separable appanage of His Worship. Meanwhile
the proletarian on the footpath hustles for a crust
and thanks Heaven he is not a millionaire with an
ambition to cut a dash in the world.

Premier Reid’s blunt common-sense slew
Albury Borough Council when that body invited
him to go there and proclaim its bridge open.”
„ w hat s the use of such humbug? ” asked Reid :
you have been going back and forward on that
bridge for a week ; therefore, it was open. I’ll
not lend myself to the idiotic formality of pi’e-
tending to open it now.” But all this common-
's 0 melted away in presence of a eoroneted
Governor. Lord Beauchamp was in Govt. House
at 11 a.m., was received there by Chief Justice
JJarley a . ” t^ers > afterwards journeyed back to
the boat in the harbor, and was welcomed ashore
after 3 p.m. by Premier Reid and others, as if
that was the first time he had touched Sydney
S< t 'a .George saw the humbug when it was a case
ot Albury aldermen, and ranted a bit in conse-
quence ; but like a notorious person in another
place found nothing objectionable to say to “Lord
Lysimmachus.”
Recently there was in Sydney a news-
paper letter-writers’ wrangle over tin question
whether the male companion of the man who
raises his hat to a lady friend in the street ought
to ignore the transaction or raise his hat likewise.
The fashion just now is as it was before it came to
be different. Once upon a time the ambition of
every Johnnie was to chip into his pal’s salutation
with enthusiasm. If Gussie acknowledged the
passing presence of anybody, male or female,
Johnnie followed suit. But a few years back it
occurred to the ruling powers in etiquette that a
stranger had no right to bow to the ladv friend of
the man he happened to be walking beside. He
might be a feller whom the lady wouldn’t care to
know, and whom his companion wouldn’t think
of making known to the fair by-passer. For a
time, therefore, it was ordained that no right-
thinking Johnnie should obtrude his lifted cadey,
so to speak, upon the notice of the girl who
smiled casually at Gussie. This arrangement
didn’t suit the other side. .A girl can’t have too
many hats off in her honour. The social standing
of the hat that she hasn’t been introduced to is
not a matter of importance as long as it behaves
properly, she reckons. The old rule was presently
put hack upon the slate, and nowadays dukes who
prowl in couples are expected to take the cue from
one another as regards bowing in a public place.
Even if one of them begs pardon for receiving the
point of a lady’s umbrella in his eye, the other
man must courteously raise his hat.

N.S. W. Marine Board censured the second
mate of the s.s. Tomki, which grounded while he
was in charge of the deck, as follows :
The stranding of the Tomki was caused (first) owing to
the default of the second mate, in neglecting his duties as
regards the navigation of the ship, by leaving the bridge
to wash the decks.
Now, was it or was it not a regular part of the
mate s usual duty as understood on board to look
after the deck-washing ? If it was, ought not the
censure to be directed against those who required
the man to be in two places, and do two things at
the same time ?

The way in which N.S.W. Marine Board

point in question should be apparent to any

A deputation of Hobart’s aged unemployed
periodically waited upon the late Minister Pii'lin-
ger to pray for work. (At Hobart, mind you,
they do seek work, even at eighty years; you
might live at Hobart for years and never be asked
for charity.) The Director of Public Works
always expressed the deepest sorrow for the woes
of the old chaps, but invariably suggested that
they should become inmates of the Government
Charitable Institution. As, under the lovely Tas.
woikhouse regulations, this involved the separa-
tion of each old Jack from every old Jill, the old
Jacks always, jointly and severally, sturdily
refused. Whereupon the Minister would heave a
puzzled sigh at the old men’s mania for pick-and-
s hovel work and ask them to call again next
morning, when a few days’work would be found
-for them at 3s. per day/ The same farce was
repeated month after month for nearly the whole
term of this Minister’s office.

The boss Rechabite whose evanishment
some 18 months ago badly shook the Cold-Tea
circles of S.A., turned up recently in Sydney.
Over 15 months ago a warrant was issued for his
arrest on a charge of illegal famine among the
cash, and the law proceeded after him by delayed
milk-train. It proceeded so slowly that many
people fancied it wanted the lamentable Rechabite
to keep ahead of it, and that there were decayed
circumstances about the case which would smell
badly if overhauled. The absconder long con-
tinued to be seen with impunity at one town and
another, but at last he dropped out of remem-
brance—till the other day an Adelaide ’tec ran
against him in Sydney, and collected him. Pro-
bably the Rechabites are sorry. The Cold-Tea
brethren are so fond of ascribing all crime to the
accursed Der-rink that when a teetotaller goes
away with the cash they would almost rather lose
the cash than capture the teetotaller.

In grim commentary upon Sydney Presby-
terian parson Auld’s complaint of the dearth of
ministers in N.S.W., it is pointed out that,
according to. the Church’s official returns, more
than half of its ministers in N.S.W. are receiving
a smaller stipend than what the General Assembly
considers the least a minister can adequately
support himself and family upon. And yet Mr.
Auld would cable ’Ome for more candidates for
semi-starvation. There’s nae fule like an Auld
fule! The Bulletin predicts that in the long
run the local Presbyterian clergy will have to
compete, not merely with cleap clerical labor
from Scotland, but also from China—the mission-
ary efforts of the denomination being apparently
centred in the effort to Calvinise the yellow man

“ Melb.”: A recent Pleasant Sunday After-
noon at Pastor Edgar’s Wesley Church fairly
staggered me, and I hear it is the regular thing.
No wonder the place was crowded. The pastor
has two monster bands—the brazen, of 20 per-
formers, and the string band of 24, including three
ladies. The latter makes Wesley Church resound
on Sunday afternoons, not by'any means with
sacred music, or with just a whiff thrown in for
decency, while the main staple is of operatic
overtures and selections, and dance music. To be
precise, they thrummed, rasped, and rootle-tootled
in my hearing that Sunday a Minuet, or Gavotte,
and a Waltz, which played the crowd out, just as
the theatre orchestras do. Fora side-show to this
two parsons, Sugden and Champness, a nut-
cracker-visaged celebrity from Britain, tried to be
funny. How Church is altered, since I was
dragged there as a boy ! Poor old Dogma 1

lers with some knowledge of the
disease state this to be the most

that it takes seven years for out-

uncertain. Leprosy is common
among Papuan natives, and
leprous blacks are frequent ori
canoes that come off to trade with
visiting vessels.
Most of Queensland's lepers arp
brought south to Dunwich by the
White Star, a little smooth-water
steamer, skippered by a grizzled,
matter-of-fact Scotchman. The
lepers are carried in a packing-
case fixture, secured as a tem-
porary deck-house. This is lined
with tin, having a small, sliding
window, through which food is
received in a tin dish. Water is
supplied through a funnel which
communicates with a bucket in-
side. The poor wretches thus
cooped up have neither speech
nor sight of anyone from the time
they go on hoard till landed at
Dunwich. These packing-cases
are always destroyed at the fini-h

gated, a new house being built

a new species of terror to public assemblies. The

In this way chairs were passed along overhead,

The olcl sovereigns issued by Sydney Mint
had a yellow-greenish tinge, caused by the pre-

their intrinsic value, when silver was ss. an

pattern on the reverse was Australia sur-

evill y - d i sposed. Consequen t ly,
this wicked paper feels sorrier
for the bad Melbourne girl who
suicided recently through sud-
denly remembering that her sis-
ter was a good girl and sang
hymns on Sunday, than if the
cases had been reversed. It
seems right, somehow, to this
conscienceless rag that the
hairs of the righteous should
go down in sorrow to the
grave for the sins of the
departed, and a burning
shame that the virtues of
the virtuous should be per-
mitted to harass and an-
noy the world in general,
tili the depraved are only
too glad by pistol or poison
to betake themselves to
that better land where
the righteous cease
from troubling and
the wicked are at
rest.
N.S.W. country
newspapers slip one
after another into the
groove dug some time ago
by a well-meaning, but sap-
headed, philanthropic journal,
which proposed to help the local
hospital by suppressing the names of
defendants in minor police-court
cases for ss. per head. I 1 ully
a score of country papers
now notify terms to the
same effect. If they added
a clause that the name of
the defendant really not able to pay t le new levy
would also be suppressed, the philanthropy would
be saner; but as it is, if the oracle works, the
press will become a record of the offences of the
poorest class only.

Ex-Chief-Sec. Gordon, of S.A., whose

the province’s gratitude would be earned if he
could restore friendly relations between Univer-
sityand Hospital, with a view to re-establishing
the medical school. But his Ex. has so far made
no sign.

AND THE SCIENTIST SWORE.
THE TRAVELLING SCIENTIST (to wife): “I often
wonder what are those strange circles, as it
were, of ringworm which I see all over Aus-
tralia on the sward. I fancifully ask myself.
‘ Are these the fairy rings of Eld? Or, to be
practical, are they the sacred spots-of the mystic
rites of the Aborrygeens? What a world of
speculation is opened up by these remarkable,
as it were, Druidical remains .”
THE BOY: “G’long, y’old goanner! Them's the

HE: “ Let me see, what shall I take? I won’t take the barmaid.”
SHE (genially) : “ That’s understood!”
“ H. 8.” to The Bulletin :
Two months ago at N.S.W. Central Criminal Court, a
youth of 16 received a sentence of two years' imprison-
ment,on a charge of indecent assault, to which he pleaded
guilty, upon a girl aged nearly 14. An application to the
presiding Judge to release the prisoner under the First
Offenders’ Act was refused, his Honor giving as a reason
why he could not see his way to grant the request, that
prisoner should, under the circumstances disclosed by the
depositions, have protected prosecutrix instead of de-
bauching her. Prisoner, who received this 2-year sen-
tence two months ago, is now at liberty, having been
released from gaol the other day. This strange narrative
would not be complete unless I stated that the offender
lives in a constituency represented by a high politician.
Evidently there is a way in N.S.W. of evading the legal
consequences of one’s misdeeds if you only know
how to go about it. As the boy was only 16 years old,
two months’ gaol, save under very special circumstances,
would probably meet his case as a first offender. But,
as you have frequently urged, all Executive sentence-
remissions should be gazetted, with the reasons therefor.

They have a queer way of interpreting iij.
Sydney police courts. The other day when a
Maltese was to be dealt with, the magistrate on
the bench adjourned the case because the in-
terpreting was so bad, he feared to do an injustice
under the circumstances. The interpreter said in
excuse that he had only heard of the case that
morning at 9 o'clock and he had not had time to
find a person to interpret. This, following so
closely on the Afghan case at Bourke, where the
Govt, interpreter allowed the employer to put
him aside and himself translate the agreement,
shows that there is a screw loose somewhere.

One Ca.pt. De Hoghten— chief of a fire-
brigade or football-club,,or something or .other-
made a speech, the other day, in the Tas. Angli-
can Synod, against the abominations of the con-
fessional in tlie Protestant Church. It was re-
printed, and sold for a penny, but the local Angli-
can book-dep&t doesn’t sell it. The reason is that
rank Popery is written on all the stained-glass
windows of St. David’s Cathedral, next door, and
is stamped on the altar and o» the candlesticks,
and that a certain Hobart Dean clean-shaves and
hears auricular confessions.

A WOMAN'S LETTER.
Mr Deab Mr™- Sydn,y ' May 24 1899 '
La*t Thursday we all rose to the occasion with
beautiful spontaneity. Post-Office Street rushed
j ains ff reen crinkled paper; flairs and
Srfect We A a 1 out Tr th ? cit y- The weather was
, And J ,le Harbor— which is going to be
talked about for some tune to come—wore its most
artful smile, and joined in the official conversation
WienY ° PpC f tu ] Illty - , And the Hatchet was
buried deep. And everybody was happy with the
that B Pn n ßs from magnanimous
Hearts that forgave before they forgot. The few
crudes who came out to hoot were so smitten by

keut7he a l! f ‘7 ne l er mea . nfc an ytf>iug else, and
Kept the groans for the equivocal earthly outlines
ofplam George Reid. How much easier it is to
hoot a plain fat commoner than a lovely thin earl!
At the Quay the police distinguished themselves
y charging bravely at all the little girls and
women Ihe red carpet at the landing—a very
ancient floor-cloth said to be the same as that used
at the Duke of Edinburgh’s reception was
brushed every ten minutes from 2 till 3 p.m.
Everything was done to keep things sacred. And
all went well till the Y.R. coachmen appeared in
,-fa!if BeaUC K anip llve , r y- Then the crowd upset
tseir over those wooden Jeameses in scarlet-plush
breeches, lavender stockings, white suede coats,
and Court shoes. Nasty, common people pep-
pered the calves with real colonial wit. And
through it all, the old man who plays at the
steamers blew off the “Dead March in Saul!”
. her of Commerce’s carriages—there were
in the procession dozens of “robbos” hired from
the undertakers—must have inspired him to that.
I thought you might like to know that the
slightest iitian tinge runs through the Earl’s
brown hair ; also, that as he sat in the carriage
waiting for the start, his lip quivered and he
thrust his hand into his breast. He puts his
p l c lireS l 1 tbe shade. The rather sickly beauty
of the photograph is not suggested in the real,
-ne looksmany degrees younger than was ex-
pected. So young, indeed, that not the slightest
suspicion of a sense of humor made itself manifest.
n short, he might pass for a nice young Byron
Kipling 3 subscnbed t 0 the Trinity and read
Lady Mary Lygon, the Governor’s sister, helped
him noticeably at the start. When that nervous
pallor overspread his face, she sat back like a
woman of thirty, and talked calmly. She wore a
quiet light-fawn coat and skirt with a Govt
House rose m her button-hole, a little lacy hat
with turquoise blue up-standers, white gloves and
a string of pearls. Through her veil there seemed
to be a charming complexion. None of the other
ladies of the party appeared.
When Lord Beauchamp was seated in his
carriage there was a great cheering and just the
faintest suspicion of hooting. One burly gentle-
man, from whose arm hung a diminutive but
herce-looking female, put his hands to his lips
and was just getting up a healthy hoot when his
companion turned on him angrily: “Shut up, you
fool, don t let em know you've got a birth-stain ! ”
And he did shut up —with great suddenness. As
the coach was passing into Macquarie-place there
were repeated cries of “ Soup waw-wn ” —that was
tor the coachman’s legs again.
A f ew hitches were necessary. Otherwise it
might have been painful to a sensitive mind to see
Mayor I arris and the Town Clerk sitting oppo-
site one another in gloomy black clothes and a dark
grey silence: They looked out of different sides of
their carriage. They carefully kept their knees from
touching. And they almost forgot the welcoming
snnle that the Mayoral presence had the right to
shed first m order of precedence. His Worship
was also first in order of nervousness—after his
v' T n there was one supreme moment
when the Mayor and the Governor saw stars to-
gether, and nearly fell over. After that, their
legs composed themselves, and the tremor resolved
itself into uupleated smiles.
And the Society of Artists gavfe itself away with
a dismal shriek. Considering how Lord Hampden
admired and purchased this callow fraternity’s
pictures, it was a rather circumscribed compliment
that waved across Pitt-street announcing 11 The
Society of Artists Welcomes its First Artist
Governor.” It may be true. And may account
for the Australian collection of portraits of Myself
and sheep and gumtrees that so many back-number
Governors have conscientiously carried away to
their ancestral homes (or porters’ lodges). ;
Government House Gates were gorgeous with
evergreens, flowers and flags, and a temporary
border of red and white flowers, and over the gate
was the legend “Welcome” and an Imperial
crown of white immortelles and red kiss-me-quick
flowers. As Copeland, M.P., passed out in his
carriage a basket of flowers fell right into his hat
and hung there a moment like a crown. An en-
thusiastic Federalist shouted “Take it home
Copeland, it’s an omen of victory.” Mr. Cope-
land bowed gracefully to the speaker and drove
away. In Govt. House itself were no decorations
—not even in the room where the swearing-in took
place.
The swearing-in was highly picturesque. Over
each door was a glittering array of bayonets.
High up on the walls hung three portraits. Two
amber-colored lights shed refulgence over an array
of bald heads, military uniforms and black
shoulders. Gold lace shone dully in the shade.
At the end of the dimly-lit apartment was what
appeared to be a huge life-size painting, but was
really a living picture of a group of women, in the
foreground of which stood a smiling damsel with
a gorgeous bouquet of flowers and crimson sprays.
It was Lady Mary. Beside her was an elderly
smiling face on a scintillating column. It was
Lady parley in black, invisible all but her face and
the shining jet trimming. Behind these two was
a sea of dim faces that faded into darkness. From
down where the light shone came the droning
voice of George Reid intoning the “ swearing in ”
—as by letters patent. “God save the Queen”
etc., etc.
Altogether it was a great and cordial reception,
but consider what wild enthusiastic applause would
have torn the skies had it been a victorious Aus-
tralian Eleven returning, and driving round to the
boom of cannon and waving of flags behind coach-
men in red plush breeches ! We must have red
plush breeches on tap when Darling and co
return.
Sonny New South Wales unburdening himself
to Sydney Morning Herald: “Yachting is a
most alluring pastime with which I have become
lascinated lam going to get a yacht of my own,
which I shall have built in Sydney, and I hope
soon to be able to realise those pleasures which are
inseparable from yachting in Sydney harbor.”
Ihen he gets rid of the sentiment: “ I have heard
much of your Beautiful . . . fully deserved.”
At ter that, what struck him most in things Aus-
trahan was the singular ability of Messrs. Reid,
Want, Salomons, and Justice Stephen. Sonny is
forgiven. He is an artful boy.
By the way, could it have been Mr. Justice
btephen who came to dinner in a white tie on
board ship? And lost his appetite at the sight of
itis Ex. s black one—which is strictly correct on
board ship, don’t you know.
a ?/r .°f clothes >. our new Gov. went to the
A. ALE. Society’s picnic in a short coat, little pot-
hat, tan boots, and no gloves. “ Picnic ” evidently
suggested the great billy-boiling institution. He
had been coached before hand in the custom, and
possibly thought he was dressing for picking up
sticks. But, then, at the Cathedral Sunday morn-
mg service he further startled Society, who had
rushed to worship in large numbers and awfully
shiny hats, by turning up on foot in a light tweed
suit. Moreover, Lady Mary Lygon wore the same
tawn tailor-made that she appeared in at the pro-
cession on Thursday to a polo-party next day.
Gan it be that Govt. House is not going to appre-
ciate the untold agonies Society has been through
in its efforts to show it knows all about what they
are wearing at Home ?
In his speech at that picnic, Lord Beauchamp
voiced the warm interest England feels in these
colonies welfare. Just to show that England
knows all about us, West End, a society weekly
has lately remarked: “Lady Mary will only remain
m iHeffioum a few months.”
A second and less casual glance at the Beautiful
Boy, bonny New South Wales, suggested quite
new trains of thought. Do you know—sacrilegious
as it may seem—he calls up visions of Charles
By'ey- A beautified, sanctified, sestheticised,
doubly-refined and distilled and spiritualised and
ethereahsed vision, of course—but there’s the
resemblance, all the same. Under a good stage-
manager, I believe His Ex. would be an abnormal
triumph that way. The same intangible some-
thing (do you know what it is, by the way?) is in
that fifteenth-century carving, which centred be-
irresistible Charles’s mundane features,
and butcher-boy hair. No woman can resist either!
And looking on, critically, one can imagine Our
Other Beautiful standing now between two futures
at the parting of the ways, as it were. One road
tods along to a lean, respectable, sanctimonious
old age, composed chiefly of nut-crackers and the
family-pew. (It rather looks as if he had al-
together set his mind on going that way, for
he has started by attending church twice on
bunday—beginning at 8 a.m.) T’other passes
through a lot of beer and smoke, and the joys of
life and other mellowing substances. In the
words of the Sunday-school teacher—“ Which is
it going to be, my boy ? ” The question may be
settled by the time his youthful Ex. leaves Sydney.
The reason why every woman in the country
has succumbed is that the Earl is just like every-
body’s first love in the London Journal. So
very like that one can hardly believe
him flesh and blood and Earl at the same
time. There is the indispensable thinness,
the Air, the Lithe Hands, the Firm but-not-
obstinate Chm, the Chiselled Nose, the Marble
Brow, the Breeding recognisable through three-
barred doors and a glass-bottled wall. All, every-
thing, that goes to make an Earl an Earl.
To corroborate me I turn up this photo, of Lady
Juanita de Vere Clitheroe’s lover, and find it sup-
ports me on every point. “The door opened,
and the Earl entered bearing in his long white
exquisitely clean hands with fleckless nails, a top
hat which he placed on the table with a move-
ment full of wonderful patrician grace. His dark
curly hair was cut close to his small and noble
head. It only broke into bunches at the high
white brow. His long, strong nose was exquisitely
modelled; his lips had that delicate manly curve
that only goes with a true nobleman’s soul; his
magnificent, swan-like neck was partially hidden,
partially concealed (sic) by a turned down collar
of the most expensive velvet; his broad but slim
shoulders and slender waist modestly denied the
brilliant deeds of battle he had rendered in de-
fence of his beloved Queen's country. And his
smile thrilled Juanita beyond all words. It was
the saddest, sweetest, loveliest, most manly and
womanly smile on all God’s earth.” To all of
Which His Ex. can answer, “ Adsum ! ”
The charm of Madam Buhrow kept up “The
Ladies’ Battle ” magically on Thursday night,
although the Y.R. party disappointed. There
was a big crowd waiting on the pavement for
another glimpse, and the house was full. Fatigue

The chief thing against Lovell as Lady Jessica’s
lover is that habit he has of pushing his long, thin
nose right into her face. But he looks, in this
part, more like the handsome man that rumor said
he was, and if the dress-suit and black hair make
him look like a waiter, it is probably due to the
dress-suit and the black hair, as a fair-haired
waiter isn t allowed on any respectable stage.
Joseph Carne, m a beard and a bell-topper, loses
his good looks and stands round like a big boy in a
very tight coat. In their own ways, these two
actors are both awkward men. Lovell’s awkward-
ness runs to sharp, self-conscious movements, and
an inability to go out of the room without touch-
ing everything he passes. He lays his hands on
three chairs and a table before he can get to the
door. Carne is roundly and heavily awkward In
repose his arms are an awful trouble to him, and
he keeps his elbows half away from his ribs. But
stilJ, nobody minds awkwardness in a man In
tact, awkward” is still very largely used in
describing heroes.
Colonel Bell, who is known as a very correct
Amurrcan, agreeably surprised everyone by cast-
ing aside the ruffled consular dignity, and taking
his place in the Beauchamp procession like a man
lhe other consuls were so bitterly wounded at
being placed after the University that they all
stayed away from the reception. Which reminds
me that one of these sticklers is noted for the
eccentric way in which he keeps his engagements.
A well-known Society woman sent him a card
lately, inscribed “At Home. Friday , from half-
past eight. MusicF He arrived on Thursday at
half-past seven. The hostess wondered, but said
nothing. After a good deal of desultory talking
the guest remarked, vaguely, that Aus-
tralians had really very extraordinary ideas
about keepung their dinner-appointments. A
little later he observed more emphatically that
the bad manners of people who didn’t come to
time ought to be severely checked. At nine
o clock the hostess woke up to the situation, and
discovered that he thought he was asked to a
dinner-party Finally he was taken away, and
regaled on cold beef in the pantry, and the hostess
felt herself covered with confusion. And this
same gentleman makes himself unpleasant by
objecting to the etiquette that refuses to put
him near the head of the procession to welcome
the new Governor.
I am sincerely sorry to have chronicled a mis-
taken item—the engagement of Miss Genevieve
Fattorini, who is at present in England and is not
engager] to anyone.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Guv’ment ’Ouse committed itself, the other
evening, to a Masonic ‘at home ’ of the deadliest
dull character. Several rows of seats in front of
the dais had the ‘ reserved ’ look which keeps the
common herd at a respectful distance, and imparts
an e^ r '7 °hill to their curiosity. On the arrival of
the -Noble Host and party, a procession filed past
to pump-handle the exalted pair, after which the
IN icer portion of the ‘ at home ’ sat down upon the
appalling plush pews, and the nobodies planted
themselves where they could. A churchy pro-
gramme was gone through by Maud Hawie, Armes
Jieaumont, S. Lamble, and the Clarke Lodge
choir, amid much yawning and subdued chatter.
I hen the refreshments were raided and upbraided,
and a few masons slunk away to quiet spots with
bottles, and the talu of sorrow may be said to end.
Sonic of the frocking dated back to the dark
years ago, and was almost an excuse for
the bad mannahs of a somebody's wife, who made
herself conspicuous by laughing and pointing a
huger of scorn at the arky figures. Lady B. was
hxed up in ham-pink satin, with cream lace
piasters and diamond top-piece. Mrs. Pakenham
scintillated in black, with silver sequins galore.
A girl in vivid pink satin, with an attempt at one
of the new sheath-shaped over-skirts, was an
example of how not to dress; and a granny in
black, with a white woollen shawl, ranked as a
good old type of independent comfort.
11 ‘passing of Marcus Superbus’ leaves a
blank. His farewell season came at a moment
when the hearts of theatre-goers were sore for
somebody worth looking at. The long-felt want
was liberally catered for in the shapely person of
M b aforesaid, whose name on the hoardings
habitually set stage-fevered women pining through
dragging daylight hours for theatre-time, and ‘Leo-s
of the evening, beautiful legs.’
The favorite was pampered socially during
those last days. Toorak invitations were common
as cauliflowers, and at Polo gatherings and such-
i l . • i!r e Naicest women couldn’t have sugared

emotion, the Poppet in question sounded a bit
catarrhal on last night of the season (May 20th)
Hoarsenessand handkerchiefs ill-befit the pocketless
toga-wearer ; but all was romance again when
Marcus said his parting say, lowering his lashes

At this stage, small-built ’kerchiefs were more in
evidence throughout the packed house than dur-

.“ A decollate dowager in the d.c. sobbed convul-
sively in response to the fareweller’s Byronic quo-
tation, as if m very truth those lissome legs were
posing their last on the threshold of the lions’ den.

PEOPLE YOU KNOW.

Mr. T. Streater writes: “I have received so
much benefit from Dr. Tibbies’ Vi- Cocoa I feel
that I must thank you for it. lam a baker by
trade, which, as you know, is very hard work, but
I am pleased to say that when I am done of a
night I go home and -have a cup of your Cocoa,
and feel quite fresh again, and then I go and
enjoy myself. But before I took to Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, I used to mess about indoors as tired as
could be.”
Vi-Cocoa will become a household word amongst
us. Prepared from substances of admitted
dietetic value, Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa is at once
digestive and refreshing, nutritious and invigorat-
ing. This is the secret of its phenomenal success.
It seems, so far as we can gather, to agree with
everybody, and everybody is agreed in giving it a
good name. Apparently it is the accepted beverage
of a people who have recognised and appreciated
its remarkable health-giving properties. And
certainly in this age of rush and worry, wear and
tear, when the energies of mind and body are so
severely taxed, it is an ideal food.
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa can be obtained from all
Chemists, Grocers and Stores, or from Dr. Tibbies’
Vi-Cocoa, Limited, 209 George-street, Sydney.
As an unparalleled test of merit, a dainty sample
tin of Dr. Tibbies’Vi-Cocoa will be sent free on

ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of
experience, can be had in 4 sizes, by post 1/4, 2/6,
3/8, 4/8, in N.S.W. only. To all the other colo-
nies 1/8, 2/8, 3/8,5/2. Beware of imitations. Only

The current English sensation relates to
the fact that a very fashionable white peeress has
presented her white husband with a coffee-colored
PrinteCi 'Miat Premier Reid “ didn’t go to
Albany merely to see the Governor, and arrange
for political possibilities ; he went because the doc-
tors were alarmed. He suffers from kidney
trouble.” ,
Rumored that John Morley, as Gladstone s
biographer, will have to tell awkward truths.
There are already some ugly stories afloat about
the G.0.M., who certainly lived too long tor ms
own reputation.
Edmund Barton was once M.L.A. for
Wellington, the N.S.W. constituency now repre-
sented by John Haynes. Barton’s first seat was
for the University, but on the abolition of that
institute as a political body he looked afield ana
lighted on this outback territory.
Some of the precursors of Australian
Federation who, in the wilderness of local politics,
cried for a Commonwealth over 40 years ago :
W. C. Wentworth, in 1853 ; Deas Thomson, 1856 ;
Ga'van Duffy, John O’Shanassy, Archibald Michie,
Dr. Evans and Janies M'Culloch in 1857.
Premier Turner summed-up Gov. Beau-
champ as “a second Lord Hopetoun a very
unthinking remark. Hopetoun was a sickly
young man, with a thin, nasal accent, very little
“ mannah ” and a wife. Beauchamp appears to be
a healthy bachelor with a lot of “ mannah.”
Premier Reid’s three defeated Ministers
are now provided for. Gould is M.L.C. ;he is too
rich to want pay, but he wears a gold pass, a big
advantage in itself. Jake Garrard is chairman of
Sydney Water and Sewerage Board at .£7OO a
a year ; and Pumpkin Smith is made president of
the Unemployed Board.
The Queensland J.P. is a festive animal.
T’other day a sanguinary Rattle took place near
Brisbane between two rival political barrackers.
Capital went down in the rough-and-tumble, got
badly bashed, and had his ear bitten by pugnacious
Labor. Principal witness was a prominent J.P.,
who “regretted to see the fight, but did not see
sufficient cause to interfere.”
A CIRCULAR QUAY SKETCH.
Premier Kingston’s great endurance and
capacity for work astonish even his friends.
Despite poor health he worked like an elephant
right through the recent election campaign, and
has been since relieving his colleagues during
their holidays. Kingston says six years of
Ministerial life have left him so poor that he is
compelled to deny himself the vacation urgently
prescribed by his doctor.
Matthew Batbersby, ex-member for More-
ton (Q.), who died suddenly the other day, had a
long run in politics. For 11 years he was the most
wildly-ineoherent Malaprop in the seven Parlia-
ments, and when he dropped out last year most
of the joy departed from Q. Assembly ._ Battersby
wasn’t a premeditated humorist, but in a purely
accidental way he contributed much to the gaiety
of a rather tired community.
A certain illiterate person, recently elected,
will make a characteristic addition to a fossilized
Parliament. When asked by a miner if he
favored the abolition of the Upper House and the
substitution of the referendum he had to ask his
ohairman what the “substitution of the referen-
dum ” meant. When handed the menu-card once
at a city hotel he started to read it upside-down,
and ordered “ tinned meat! ”
SOUND EVIDENGE .

“ Good—rather! Do we look like drinking bad

Characteristic and true story about a
(junior) N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge. At re-
cent Assizes he was presented with a pair of
white gloves to commemorate the fact that he
would not be called upon to try any criminal
charges. To a sheriff’s officer he confided the fact
that he was already possessed of more white
gloves than he had any use for, and preferred a
request that they be exchanged for a pair of
“ tans.”
The just-published Art Annual contains
a list of the pictures of Broken - Hillionaire
McCulloch, now one of the chief art-patrons in
London. The list is interesting for the reason that
Mac’s Melbourne friends confidently say he means
to give his treasures to Australian galleries some
day. The pictures are just such as a millionaire
might be expected to buy—Leighton’s, Millais’,
etc. ; the sort of things about which a man can say
in an off-hand fashion, “ I gave £5OOO for that can-
vas, and £hooo for this, and I wouldn't sell them
for ,£20,000.
Mrs. Ann Houison, a very old colonist, died
at Parramatta the other day, aged 85. She came
to N.S.W. in 1832, and, two years later, married
Mr. Jas. Houison, an architest and builder whose
handiwork still remains in St. John’s Church, All
Saints Church, Subiaco Convent (the old home of
the Maoarthurs), and Parramatta gaol ; the old
courthouse was also built by him. Mrs. Houison
lived in Parramatta for 67 years. She leaves
eight children and 32 grandchildren, among the
former being Dr. Andrew Houison, of “ Old Syd-
ney ” renown.
Some of the Victorian judges are wholly
devoid of fighting inclinations, as is illustrated
by a story told of Justice Holroyd. It seems
he was asked to join with one or two other
judges in protesting against the proposed ap-
pointment of Dr. Madden to the post of
Chief Justice. He stroked his long white
beard with his old red bundle - handkerchief,
smiled on his importuner and said, “ Well, I don’t
think I’ll bother about it. The next best thing to
being appointed Chief Justice is to have had the
Chief Justice reading in your chambers.”
Bruce Smith is a keen student of Herbert
Spencer, and keeps that author’s works with his
law-books in his chambers. One day, while
Prenlier Reid was visiting Bruce Smith’s cham-
bers, the latter enquired—“Have you ever read
these?” “What are those?’’said Reid, adjust-
ing his eyeglass. “ Herbert Spencer,” replied
Bruce Smith. “No, never. I’ve never seen hi 3
reports before,” said the same old George. Now,
Bruce Smith tells the story as an illustration of
the dense ignorance of G. H. Reid, while Reid
tells it as a fine example of Bruce Smith’s lack of
humor.
The Argus, James Service’s own paper,
in printing 3 cols, of his life, forgot all about the
Brough Smyth incident, and how J.S. revolu-
tionised Vic. Mining Department in the
seventies, and delivered the serfs of the Collins-
street Czar from their Siberia. After years of
suffering, the mining men revolted against the
tyrannous Secretary. The Peter Lalor of the
place was little Hickey, a Liverpool-Irishman,
who caused much amusement by his acting when
he told his story before the Commission. He
illustrated things by attitudes, grimaces, and ven-
triloquism, and made his evidence a most inter-
esting entertainment. R. Brough Smyth, other-
wise, “Robert Smith,” as his real name was
shown to be, got the tip to stand from under, and
on the day that Service and the others submitted
their report R.B.S. tendered his resignation.
James Service’s father
used to work religion as a hobby. Every
Sunday preaohed on the Melb. wharves
to a miscellaneous crowd. Had the
Bible at his tongue’s end, and quoted
like an almanac. A big, broad-shoul-
dered man, with a hoarse voice and a
knock-me down manner of charting
the road to Paradise. He and another
apostle named Peter Virtue never
missed a Sunday while they lasted.
Dry or wet, they turned up on the
wharves and held forth, ohiefly on
Old Testament matters. Great on
the bald-headed prophets, and the
much-married patriarchs, and the
history of begettings—such as read
so curiously like the pedigrees of
blood horses in the sporting news-
papers. Harmless, but irritating,
they used to get into great disputes
with blear - eyed beer - eaters and
wharf-rats, who took heretical views
of things, and ran out their own
primitive notions, and blasphemed
pretty freely. These were the men
old-man Service loved to talk to and
smother with his Biblical lore. And,
that done, he would go home to his
dinner with an appetite.
The other day a smart man
blatantly related in the bar of a big
hotel that it was the custom of com-
mercial travellers, when they re-
turned home after a long absenoe, to
knock loudly at the front door and
then run quickly and quietly round to
the back portal. Whereupon a mus-
cular drummer who happened to be
there broke his jaw, and there is to be
law over the matter.
About those “wolves and thieves.’’
Lachlan Brient, editor of Sydney D.T.
and head sooler-on of the N.S.W. Gee-
bungs, is a Tasmanian, trained in jour-
nalism in Victoria. Watkin Wynne,
manager of the Teleghaph, is from Bal-
larat (not Bungaree) via, Melbourne.
Peters, the bright satirist, whose fancy
paints ornamental descriptions of meet-
ings and evolves mysterious cab-rides,
is a South Australian; and leader-
writer Farrell is an ex-Victorian.
Roberts, the able mining-editor, is a
Bendigonian. Langhan, the boss
advertising-man, is a Melbournite;
and even Macaulay, the harmless but
necessary printer, is another Victorian,
as well as most of the comps. It is
understood that at least several of these
able personages are, in private, highly
respectable Federalists, who, if they
had to write up the Bill . But on
matter. Still it is weird to think of the
frantically parochial N.S.W. Geebung
crowd having to hire all these Vic-
torians and other “outsiders” to howl
for it. Freetiade seems to have so de-
pressed N.S.W’s native industries that
even its parochial curse has to be im-
ported.
Gillies, member for West Maitland
in N.S.W. Leg. Assembly, rivals his next-door
member, Brunker, in thick-headednessandcapacity
for getting roads and bridges. Every party-leader
who wants Gillies’ support has to pay heavily on
the nail in roads-and-bridges. But when Premier
Reid, the other day, tried to borrow Gillies’ vote
for a close division, Gillies for once wouldn’t turn
an ear to the charmer —said he liked his charmers
less than 90in. round the waist, or words to that
effect. Reid argued, pleaded, persuaded—in vain.
“We can’t work together; we can’t vote together,”
said Gillies, on his way to the lavatory. “ Well,”
said Reid, “ there’s one thing we can do together,
Mr. Gillies.” “What’s that?” says Gillies.
“We can —wash our hands together,” says Yes-
No, beamingly. And they did.
“ Honest John ” Duthie—the adjective is
supposed to differentiate him from the other
member of his own party in M.L. House of Re-
presentatives—is at present laid on his back and
ordered to be kept very quiet, because of aortal
aneurism. He knocked himself up by a recent
stumping tour in opposition to the “ Sins of
Seddon.” On the campaign his most notable
utterances were one in which he advocated the
wholesale acquisition of Maori territory, on the
ground that no white man should have a “nigger
landlord,” and a statement that the population
which Maoriland gains from Australia is entirely
made up of “blacklegs and spielers.” Honest
John, though very Scotch and very dour, has since
found it expedient to apologise to the Maoris for
calling them niggers.
The Real Property Act, with its simple
and inexpensive system of titles-registration and
transfer, has become so universally adopted that
it is hard to believe that the man who helped its
originator, Torrens, to get it in operation has
only just died. Torrens, an old political hand
who had had much to do with the issue of original
grants in South Australia, got the idea that it
would involve little trouble to register every trans-
fer ; and that was the beginning of the existing
general legislation, administered first in his own
province by Torrens, and then by his former as-
sistant, W. B. T. Andrews. The latter has
within the last fortnight died, aged 81, having
been run over by a railway train near his home in
the Adelaide Hills.
Two well-known Melbourne characters are
named J. W. Fleming, and each snorts at any
mention of the other. Councillor J. W. Fleming,
who claims to be the first white native of Victoria,
lives at Brunswick, surrounded by his own pro-
putty and clothed in a profound sense of his im-
portance to the Hempire. Is said to have written
a letter to Queen Victoria, informing her that he
was born in the year when she came to the Throne,
j. W. Fleming, the perennial spokesman for the
unemployed, lives, works, and sleeps in one room,
and a small room at that. Every Sunday, wet or
dry, for 14 years the frugal bootmaker has held
open-air meetings, where the working-man is ex-
horted to buck-up for his rights. Has been twice
gaoled for “ agitating.” Reads history and swears
by the French Revolution.
“ The late saccharinely-suasive Gov. Sir
George Bowen,” writes Sydney D.T.’s interesting
London correspondent, “ always overdid his super-
latives. He was once dining with a party of judges
and lawyers, and describing rather exuberantly
the generous character of the Maori. ‘ Why,
sir,’ said he to the late Sir Janies Stephen, ‘ it was
my most painful duty during the New Zealand
war to order the execution of a gallant and very
influential and wealthy chief. Later, when peace
was declared, I made, on behalf of our gracious
sovereign, aprogress through the defunct warrior’s
domains. Would you believe it, gentlemen, his
brother not merely bore me no ill-will, but received
me with profuse acclamations ; yes, profuse accla-
mations.’ ‘Ah ! ’ said Judge Stephen, drily,
‘ I suppose he must have been the heir-at-law.’ ”
i Mrs. Nutting, who lately married
t' i' A r °y> Mount Morgan millionaire, in
London, brings wealth again to a stock that ex-
perienced many Australian vicissitudes. She was
the daughter of poor old Arthur Leslie Bouroi-
cault (brother of Dion, though he spelled his name
with an “r”) whose red waistcoat, velvet coat,
Bedford cords, and other haberdashery for years
brightened the goldfields of Rockhampton, Gym-
pie, and other Queensland mining centres.
I hen he tried Shepparton (Vic.); and a few
years ago he bought into a sheet at Ko-
garah, near Sydney, but was broken-spirited,
was soon carried to Rookwood Cemetery.
.e.Present Mrs. Nutting, a most charming girl,
originally Mary Bouroicault, was his favorite
child. She married Nutting in Australia, ob-
tained a divorce, and at her second wedding was,
curiously enough, given away by her ex-husband’s
brother.
An Age scribe, writing of Marcus Clarke’s
work, says that he wrote some 17 years too early,
and so fared no better pecuniarily than Sheridan,
Theodore Hook, and Poe. Which shows that
that scribe has yet to learn a thing or two. Sheri-
dan’s literary and dramatic work brought him in
many thousands; Hook made from .£2OOO to
■£3ooo a year out of his novels; and Poe could
probably have done well enough had he kept
straight. As for Clarke, he never would have
become a popular writer, in the sense that Kipling
and Barrie are popular. And he knew it. Kind
and generous and lovable as he was, he had not
the secret of touching the heart. And his humor
was not of a popular kind. Clarke, moreover, had
little of the creative faculty. His metier was that
of the French-polisher. He could take the crude
and ill-shaped, and make it a thing of beauty, but
the first mould was not his.

Duncan Gillies, avidly hungering for office,
feels the past A.-G.-ship hanging like a millstone
round his neck. The A.-G.-ship kills most
politicians who succumb to it. Even Berry re-
turned paralysed. But Duncan hopes still and
watches Turner 23 hours out of the 24. Thirty-one
years ago he held Ministerial office, and off and
on throughout the period between then and now-
be h as gathered in the victor’s spoils. For sixteen
y ears he has drawn official screw as Minister or
a.-G. Therefore belief that he will win again is
second nature.

larly excels. He married into the family of the
Earl of Carlisle, and in monetary affairs has no

“ We always confidently anticipate a good year from this

When things were “humming” in Ar.v
luen a preacher-man wandered into the valley after
converts, and one pay evening he mounted a giu-
case and held forth on tho Soul. “ Every man,”
said he, “has a soul to save. Even the poor
Irishman has a soul to save.” Then the gin-case
was kicked from under him, and he made for the
mountain witli numerous M‘Graths and O’Hooli-
gans, to say nothing of Ryans, in close pursuit.
Ihey ran him into a swamp at Jembaicumbene,
and he must have perished, for he has never been

X. : Recently witnessed an interesting
marriage at Balranald, N.S.W. Contracting
parties were aboriginals, and the bride, an ex-
pupu of the local convent, appeared in spotless
white, with orthodox veil, bouquet, etc. The
bridesmaids, also “darkies,” were equally la
mode. All rolled up to church in buggies; and,
“ le evening, about 50 corroboree’d on the hank
or the Murrumbidgee. There was but one hitch:
the pnest declining to ask any fee aroused my
lords ire. “You charge a white fellow five

“ Mac.” : Soon before the Clarkes took to
the bush, a. neighboring cookie caught them red-

and galloped to Braidwood (nine miles) for the
police. Clarkes stood paralysed, but their sisters
“ came to the rescue,” drove up one of their own
two-year-olds, shot it on the same spot, bagged-up
the “ cronk ” steer, slung it on horse, and sank it
in Shoalhaven River, two miles off. The Clarkes
looked quite innocent when, two hours later, two
policemen and a tracker arrived and demanded
the “hoide.” “ The nixt toime, Mishthur Hogan,”
said the Italian sergeant, “ that ye bring me out

“ Titoki ” tells of a tight place :
We were “telegraphing” posts across a M.L. ravine.
Had with us a new-chum, and one evening, having to
walk four miles round to get to the camp (which we could
see, not 200yds. away across ravine), we kidded Chummy
to cross on the wire. He accordingly fastened a stick on
a bit of wire, and, hanging it over the telegraph-line,
and then sitting astride the stick, let go. First 50yds. he
went like an express train, then gradually slowed up, and
stopped 50yds. from other side ; then came back a bit,
and then vice versa, until at last he stopped dead in the
middle of the wire, 150 ft. from the bottom. To climb
up the wire was impossible, and we hadn’t a rope
to send to his aid, so he had to stay there while we
went round to the camp for a wire, which took us three
hours, night setting-in meanwhile. We couldn’t see him
when we returned, so sent him a wire, but got no re-
sponse-puHed it back empty. Nothing for it but for

Cooney’s newly-purchased moke had libbed
at tho bridge over the creek, and after all the

“Meteor”: “A.A.A.’s” description of
duck-catching (8., 6/5/’99) contains nothing new •
but in a book of short native stories, written
by now-deceased School-Inspector Kevan it is
stated that the gins fastened round the men’s
bodies from waist up, bands of reeds interlaced
v ith twigs, the man having also round waist a
girdle of kangaroo-sinew nooses. The duck-
catcher then proceeded much as already described •
bub would sometimes actually occupy hours in’
leaving the water, so careful was he not to let the
ducks suspect what had been happening.

swallowing a decent pinch of powdered gall-nut

“ Ben Sun ” : Can match
“ Ercildoune’s ” cocktail (8.,
22/4/’99). An insect, from
three-quarters to an inch Jong,
is found on the leaves of the
eucalyptus, from which it is
with difficulty detached. Has
on its back what looks like
two rows of tiny cells pro-
tected by thornlike points.
Its color is that of the leaves,
on the under-side of which it
is always found. A white
liquid oozes from it when dis-
turbed, contact with which is
like the touch of fire, and as
quickly felt; a blister is the
sure result. The most viru-
lent sort is found on stunted
box and messmate scrub; a
milder variety on the more
vigorous blue-gum. This in-
sect ought to have a career in
medical circles.

“Alia” ; Be curious
finds by dredges. Amongst
those chronicled in the M.L.
press is a roll of 30 miners’
rights, hauled up from the
bottom of the Molyneux
River. The rights dated back
to the early ’6o’s, and were
m fair state of preservation,
the issuer’s signature being
quite legible on several. At
Alexandra, on same river,
a dredging-party, breaking
down the river bank, found a
perfect moa’s egg 15ft. below
the surface. As this is only
the. second perfect egg of the
extinct bird ever found it
was almost as valuable to
the finder as if it had been
gold. As for such trifles as
human bones, they happen
quite regularly.
Dear Bulletin. —Have we now so few
birds worth shooting because they are “pro-
tected ? Once, when “flock” pigeons were
about, got 39 in two shots ! The birds alighted
on a 40ft. cabbage-tree, and weight of them
brought top of tree within 10ft. of ground. They
were after the berries, and ther'e must have been
thousands of them. At Lake Illawarra, a man
once shot 35 ducks in twice ; and, again, at Lake
Oeorge, I. “ potted ” 34 in two goes. Haven’t
seen any flock ” pigeons for years, and, when I
came upon wild-ducks the other day, I got a
severe start.— Albion Park.

“Yang A.” : Once belonged to a Borneo
club which had for each member a separate book,
recording his drinks and smokes, for monthly
square-up. The club “ boys ”—Chinamen—know-
ing no English, used Malay to communicate with
members, and each member’s book had a label,
with his name in Chinese and English. Present
scribe wrote his own label, and, later on, learned
that the Chinese version thereof was “long-haired,
spectacled fellow, who never wears a hat.” I took
the trouble to translate the Chinese “names ” on
some of the other books. “Solitary boozer,”
“Cock-eye,” “Red-headed slab,” “ Eour-eyes,”
“ Deaf-’un,” are fair equivalents for some of them,
and his Excellency was set down with charming
simplicity as “The big ———.” Another promi-
nent official appeared as “ The bigamist.” You

“ J.A.” : Have found aboriginal stone
axes in Yie. and on the Murrumbidgee, Lachlan,
and Bogan. They are always made of same kind
of stone, very hard, fine in grain, and pale-green
in color. Any Bulletin reader say what stone
this is, where found, and for what purpose these
axes were chiefly used ?
“ C.D.” : Got this from eye-witness a few
days after occurrence. Pascoe River (Q.) blacks
have a standing feud with the Margaret Bay
tribe and sent a hostile expedition against them,
which, however, found the M.B. blacks too
numerous to deal with. Result of a parley was
that a nig. known as “Pascoe Johnny” had to
undergo the spear-ordeal, in return for several
former killings. Had to stand up and defend
himself with a woomerah from the spears thrown
at him from short range. He parried 14, but the
next struck him on the shoulder, turned down-
wards, and pierced his lungs. Blood gushed from
mouth, nose and ears, and in five minutes he was
dead. His body was taken charge of by his tribe,
who next day hung it in a tree and made a fire
underneath to smoke-dry it. It was then taken
down and back to Pascoe district.

“ A.A. A." :Be scars on black-gins’ arms.
Have never seen any coast-tribe women marked
as “ H.M.” describes. The male aboriginal, how-
ever, is thus gashed on both breasts and arms on
attaining puberty. The scars, called “ Bheerans-
mer,” are always made after he has been through
his first keeparra, during which curious perform-
ance no women are allowed to be present. In
fact, have heard of women being killed for peep-

“W.T.S.”: Was once told by an old
rabbiter, when I asked if he wasn’t afraid of
snakes, that there was no danger in putting your
hand in a “ covered-in ” or breeding burrow.
Found one, last winter, on a sand-ridge. Cleared
away the rubbish, poked a stick up about arm’s
length and felt something soft. Young rabbits, I
thought, and put my arm in to get them. Felt
something, and as it did not move, caught hold
and pulled out a big black snake in a state of
torpor. Have hardly recovered yet!

“Kooka”: Be animal companionship. A
selector near Rockhamption, Q., had an old tom-
cat which chummed with one of his dogs but
would not let any other dog come near him. The
two friends would hunt together, and when the
owner went out shooting the cat would follow at
heel as well as the dog. Same selector had a
wallaby which had been brought up with the dogs.
Used to follow them all over the place, and if they
started a ’roo or a wallaby would join in the chase
with gusto. Was always in at the kill, and would
hop round the ring of tearing dogs as if to get a
good view of the proceedings.

“ Tom " Courtney (whose portrait is given
in this issue) is the political sledge-hammer with
which Sydney Daily Telegraph batters its Joss
and destroys all other things that temporarily
obstruct its conscienceless path. Acquaintances
who see the hard-hitting writer walking down
King-street, with hands behind his back, accuse
him of deep cogitation upon fresh methods of
falling upon whatever poor political gnat the D.T.
finds troublesome for the time being ; but Mr.
Courtney strenuously repudiates the idea. When
he thinks, it is to the accompaniment of his pen.
Neither does he ever take a note of any political
utterance ; if an orator’s shafts do not strike him
sufficiently hard for remembrance, they are pro-
bably not worth flinging at other people’s heads.
Mr. Courtney takes little stpck in politics for
other than journalistic purposes, and is regarded
in newspaper circles as the possessor of an ideally
journalistic temperament. There is the scribe
who can walk towards the office without thinking
of the leader which he is to be writing within the
next few minutes ; who, when he sits down, can
think of nothing else ; and who, when he
stands up again, after turning off a column,
can put on his hat and utterly forget
what he has written —the man whose heart
goes not one beat a minute faster with the flow of
his praise or denunciation : such a man is built
for daily-newspaper work, and lasts at the game.
Of Tom Courtney’s 40 years or so, twenty have
been spent in press work—more than two-thirds
of the time as D. T. leader-writer. It is said that
he stepped into serious newspaper work through
getting himself embroiled in a S. M. Herald
controversy with ex-Editor Garran; and the
Bulletin is devoutly sorry, for Australia’s sake,
that the timid organ of “ neutrality ” does not
employ writers of his fighting capacity—mind
you, they are hard to get—to sling bricks at Dibbs
and Haynes and S. A. Rosa and the two Heydons
and G. Pile’s dog—and the D. T.

street E., Melb., makes beautiful teeth or teeth

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Dear Bulletin.— You ask what Meib.Onekeb
Club has done that is inimical to the interests of tru
sport I’ll mention a few things I happen to know off-
hand. It has bought up, or tried to buy up.everyfooL
bailer and cricketer of promise in rival clubs,, till the
wonder of it is that the huge monster has not dc.eated its
own ends by having nobody to play against .“ h “
the moving spirit of the cricket and football leagues
which were formed a few seasons ago for th e sole Purpose
of getting all the gate-money into the hands of the big
and wealthy clubs and blocking the aspiring and poorer
ones from any chance of progress ; and, in its play on tne
cricket-field, it has been guilty of devices as mean and
contemptible as any that have ever disgraced the shadiest
suburban pony-course. In addition to this, the M.u.U
is responsible for the bringing to Australia of those or-
ganisations of cads and beer-sparrers known as English
elevens. The visit of an English team merely tends to
drag in the shekels to the promoters, and, as lntercluD
cricket is practically spoilt for the season, lads whose
play would be gradually improving during that time nuss
a year’s play.—M‘G.
Fact that a certain Sydney Ikey
Mo (new member of Tatts.) carries pool-
marbles in his pocket—draws one out be-
fore betting on each race, and has “no
money ” about the nag indicated by that
number. It conies off, too, almost as fre-
quently as does the stable-information of
his brethren. Rank outsider got home
recently, and bookie was seen afterwards
rapturously kissing marble with number
corresponding with that of winner in race-
book.
“Face”: Re gray horses. Bulle-
tin par recalls the wonderful little Lillie
Bridge pony of a few years back—Fashion.
She was a'gray and only 12 hands high,
but a regular little race-horse, and wor-
shipped by pony punters as though she
were a Carbine—which she was in her
class, and there w ere smart ponies about
then. Fashion carried some remarkable
weights home in record time, and in her
last race humped 12‘9 (more than a stone
per hand) in a 3-furlong h’cap and won in
a canter, the crowd cheering her home
from when she went to the front at half-
way. She was entered again but the han-
dicapper piled 13'7 on "to her, and her
owner refused to allow her to start and
sent his little champion to the stud. Al-
though gray horses are as a rule even-
tempered, Fashion w r as a little tigress and
always gave trouble at the post.

Amusing to read that Dawson,
who is fully 25 years younger than John
Roberts, attributed his defeat, in their re-
cent billiard-match to ill-health, and threa-
tened to have another go at "the failing old
’un on even terms next year. Meanwhile
somebody offers to back the champion
for £lOOO to give Dawson 5500 points in a
game of 21,000 up, w 7 ith the proviso that
the balls shall be bonzoline, instead of
ivory. The objection to ivory is in the
impossibility of ensuring an even distri-
bution of weight throughout the ball. Two
balls may be of exactly the same size and
weight, but either of them is likely to be
heavier iii one place than another.
* * *
Miss Grace Fairweather, the pre-
sent champion lady billiard-player of Eng-
land, got her first instructions in the
higher branches of the game from John
Roberts and his brother Charles, who seem
to have advised their fair friend to go in
chiefly for nursery cannons. Her best
breaks up to date are 82 (all cannons) and 72 (made all
round the table), and she gets her 30’s and 40’s as freely
as the average male amateur of the advanced rank. All
the same, Miss Fairweather pleads guilty to being “no-
thing but nerves ’’ when she faces an audience. She
starts badly every time, and would probably get her
heart broken early in the game if she matched herself
against a mere man who was no better than herself in
private practice. Not that the average man can play his
best before a crowd, unless he has a soft thing on, but
Miss Grace would be the necessary soft thing. Now, sup-
posing Tliekla Dubberke had been born to “ live on a
billiard-table.’ She might have developed into a shining
light.

“ Gobung ”: Re Sloan seat. Pouy-jockey
Albrecht was riding this style at Breakfast Creek (Bris-
bane) some six years ago, before Sloan’s riding was ever
commented on in Australia. Being then only a beginner,
he got very few decent mounts, but managed neverthe-
less to get some rank outsiders home. Believe he is at
present in Sydney, but cannot say if he still rides same
way.

“ Burnie ” : Re the Tod Sloan seat. What

stumble? Writer can sit as tight as most people, but

“ Scrip ” : Experienced cab-horses become very
cunning. A big-repository runner tells me that some of
his best workers are the most eccentric when at home and
out of collar. One, reserved for early-morning jobs, un-
dresses himself when harnessed and tied up, getting every
scrap of leather off with fire-brigade smartness. Then,
chewing the rope through, backs out, uncovers all the
corn-bins in turn, and concludes supper with a few dozen
carrots. Another, given the liberty of the yard, eats any-
thing, from bread to blackberries ; knocks at the kitchen-
door for his dole, and, if it is open, walks in and helps
himself. He can turn the pantry-key, and is an incur-
able thief. A piebald, once owned by an indulgent publi-
can, whips out when he sees a gate open, and trots into
the nearest pnb. to see if his name’s good enough for a
beer.

There are a hundred ways of driving a coach-
and-four through an Act of Parliament. “ Tattersall,”
precluded by legislation from advertising his consulta-
tions in Queensland, simply inserts his card in the papers :
“ ‘ Tattersall,’ care of George Adams, Hobart, Tasmania.”
It gets there just the same.

When Charley Turner visited Woolwich Ar-
senal, he was asked to bowl through the electric screens
used for measuring the velocity of projectiles. At a
point representing half-way between the wickets it was
found that the velocity of the ball was 81ft. per second,
or 50 miles an hour. At this rate the ball just takes
22-27ths of a second to traverse a cricket-pitch. Now,
“Jonah” is a considerably faster bowler than Turner,
therefore, it is not overstating the fact when one says
that the South Australian bowls at the rate of a mile a
minute.

Many cycle-racing smashes are caused by one

Howell’s ten-wickets’ feat will make him in de-
mand in England. It was asserted a while ago that
Phillips intends to make Penrith Bill his next recruit for
Middlesex. The prospect of one or two more trips to
England may influence Bill against staying, but the big
benefit which comes to every English pro. is also alluring.

Bill Howell’s bowling feat against Surrey hm-
only been paralleled once in international crioket. Againsl
the'’7B Australian team E. Barratt, playing for Players on
Kennington Oval, took all 10. wickets for 43*runs. There
is no comparison in the merit of the two performances,
however, as Barratt had three men stumped and seven
caught, whereas Howell clean bowled eight. Geo. Giffen,
for the ’B4 Australian team against Combined Australia,
in Sydney, took all 10 wuckets for 66. Howell’s latest
record of’lO for 28 “ lays over ’em all,” however.

HOODWINKING JUSTICE.
"MARYBO[?]OUGH, Friday.-The boy Windsor, aged 14, who pleaded pleaded guilty to having attemted to wreck a train on the Wycheproof line, was brought up for sentence at the Marybough Criminal Court to-day. Mr. Justice Hood felt very much perplexed what to do with the boy. If he had the power he would order
him a smart nogging; but, unfortunately, he had not that power. If he sent him to prison it would be be for a long term, and that would undoubtedly make the lad a confirmed criminsl. The only course was to send him to the reformatory, at Royal Park, where he ordered him to be kept until he reached the age of 1S
years. His Honor expressed a hope that some excuse would be found at the reformatory to give him a sound flogging."
JUDGE HOOD: "The law doesn't allow ME to flog this boy; but there's nothing to prevent you from commiting reformation with violence." THE REFORMER: "Suppose the boy's conduct is exemplary?" JUDGE HOOD: "Then give some exemplary punishment!"

GOOD
FOR ALL
Twenty years of assiduous study of the “Hair and its Treatment” has
enabled me to discover and to prepare, scientifically, preparations that will positively
remove all parasitical diseases of the hair, Alepetia, Ringworm, and Congestion
the Scalp, exhaustion of the blood-vessels, resulting in the premature loss of the
hair, If you go bald now, it will be your own fault. If the hair follicle has not
been destroyed by other treatment, my preparations will, if used a reasonable time
Th P/ e i Qature de , ca y and clothe your head with a luxuriant crop
, * ' Thoosands of Testimonials—which can be seen at my Consulting Rooms
—demonstrate fully the truth of that assertion.
If your hair is falling off, turning grey, or scurf forms on the head, communi-
cate with me at once, and I will tell you how the cause can be removed and your
hair restored to its original thickness and color. Stamps must be enclosed for a
reply Iwo stamps will secure the most practical treatise on the hair and its treat-
ment that has ever been written. Every person should secure one.
._$™ EKN Bee >” m her admirable article in the Australasian on the Hair, Face, and Hands,
4.1,an 'f H!ii P T 10 u e F° vvth and to restore a healthy color to the hair there is nothing more reliable
from all greasy appearance, and is exceedingly pleasant
fnl in Vbn f m E 4 & ' r TER FORSTER says Ido not know anyone who has been more success-
ful in the treatment of impoverished hair than Mr. Holland.”
These given to me'brS/and “*• f re P arat ,i ons *« the Preservation and Growth of the Hair have been
given me residing m the aristocratic suburb of Toorak, and scores of others,
b can be seen at m y Consulting Booms, 193 Collins-street, Melbourne.
Mrs. B. says :
I have used your Hair Restorer a number of years, and
so satisfactory has been its effect on the growth of my
hair that you can send any one to me, as I shall be
pleased to recommend its use, knowing by experience
that it could be used to advantage in almost any case of
hair falling out, and where a preparation is required to
improve its appearance and to keep down the scurf. My
sons are using it also most advantageously. Please send
me a 21s. bottle.
Mrs. M. says :—
We have used your Hair Restorer in the house for
about eight years, and during all that time its effect on
the growth and condition of my hair has been splendid.
I have had a severe illness two or three times, which has
caused my hair to drop out, leaving my head almost
bare ; but, thanks to your Restorer, it has grown in again
as thick as ever it was, and it still keeps in splendid
condition. All my friends it most successfully.
One of them says he would not be without it. Kindly
send one 4s. and one ss. bottle, as soon as possible.
Mr. B. says :
My hair has been very thin, almost bald, for a number
of years. I have used a good many things to check its
fall but nothing was effective until I used your Hair Re-
storer. I have used it for several months and quite a
thick crop of new hair is showing where it was so thin.
Your preparations have got a firm hold upon the people
in this district. I believe it is used in nearly every house
about here.
Miss M. says : —
I am pleased to tell you that your Restorer has proved
very beneficial in stopping my hair falling out and for
promoting its growth. While I was in England I sent to
Melbourne for it as I did not care to be without it. lam
sure you ought to do well with it, it’s such a splendid
preparation. My sisters are all using it. They like it
very much.
Mrs. B. says:
Your Hair Restorer has improved my hair so much that
1 want you to pack carefully one dozen five-shilling size
and take them on board of the mail steamer which sails
for England on Tuesday next. My husband’s hair is very
thin and falling off badly. He is rather sceptical about
its doing any good, but it has been so successful in my
case that 1 really believe it will prove efficacious in his.
marvellous jfair Restorer.
This is a Splendid Preparation for Re-
moving Scurf, Promoting the Growth, and
giving Lustre to the Hair. Every person
desirous of preventing their hair from falling
oft, and securing a luxurious head of hair,
should use RESTORER.
Ladies should use it on their children, as
it is perfectly harmless, and will positively
secure to them a good head of hair.

Miss D. says :
I have used your Hair Restorer for years, and I find it
an exceedingly pleasant and valuable restorer. It keeps
my head free from scurf, and my hair in a glossy condi-
tion. I have sent several bottles to friends, and they all
speak highly of its effect on the hair.
Mrs. P. says :
My daughter had a severe illness a year or two ago, and
all her hair dropped out, leaving her head quite bare. We
had her head shaved, and used all kinds of restorers to it,
but all to no effect. As her hair did not grow we had to
get a wig, which she has worn for some time. Your Hair
Restorer was brought under our notice, and 1 am glad to
say its effect is beyond all praise. My daughter can now
do without a wig, as her hair covers her head nicely.
Mrs. A. says ;
I have been advised by my sister, who has used your
Restorer most successfully for a number of years, to con-
sult you about my hair ;it is going grey. My brother’s
hair was losing its color, and a few months’ use of your
Restorer has brought back the color to his hair, and it is
now in a splendid condition. 1 have heard so many
people speak so highly of your preparations that I have
every confidence in your ability to treat my hair success-
fully.
Mrs. G. says :
Some time ago I met with a severe accident. I was
in a room when an explosion of gas took place, and the
whole of my hair was destroyed, and the scalp was burned
terribly. So severely was it injured that we thought it im-
possible for the hair to grow again. Even the doctor
thought it could not grow again. But, lam thankful to
say, after a few weeks’ treatment with your Parasene, it
showed every sign of growing, and, at the end of three
months’ treatment, it is now as thick as ever it was, and
is still improving rapidly.
A. J., Head Nurse, says:
I feel I could write a hook on the good your Kair
Restorer has done to tin- children’.-; hair under my charge.
I have proved it, to be a sovereign remedy for all scalp
affections and for making the hair grow; it is truly a
wonderful preparation. It is such a pleasant thing to
use, too. One of the maids had a bald patch on her head
a few months ago, and now it is quite covered with hair
that speaks most eloquently of the hair-producing pro-
perties of your Restorer. I always recommend it every-
where I go.

Dreyfus Still a Martyr.
Imprisoned on a lonely island. Surrounded by
miasmatic vapours, and deprived of all but the
necessaries of existence. Poor Dreyfus suffered
untold martyrdom, and thousands thought of his
probable innocence, and pitied him in his suffer-
ing. There are, however, martyrs in our midst
deserving of our pity—those who are quite as
innocent; those who are starving, with plenty
around them,' hungry all the time, but dare not
satisfy their craving for food, because they are
martyrs to indigestion. The well-known phreno-
logist of High-street, Dunedin, Mr. A. E
Wheeler, thus pictures his experience : “ Having
been a martyr for many years to that terrible
malady, indigestion, I was induced to try a bottle
of Warner’s Safe Cure, which was said to give
speedy relief,
“ Not being one who swallows every new pre-
scription that is forced upon the public, it took
some persuasion before I tried the aforesaid ‘Safe’
Cure, and I found, to my great delight, that its
virtues were in no way over estimated. Although
not through with the first bottle, I have been
agreeably conscious of its merits in relieving this
terribly afflicting complaint, and can only in fair-
ness add my testimony to the many others who
have secured relief from using Warner’s Safe
Cure.”*

POLITICAL
POINTS
On Household Suffrage, the reform which
Premier Kingston makes the main plank of
• P°hcy, S.A. Assembly is almost equally
divided. In a House of 56 members the Govt,
reckon on 28 votes in favor.
Jack ’ Want was Attorney-General in the
<ennings, the Reid and the first Dibbs Ministries.
He declares himself an out-and-out Freetrader,
but he assisted Jennings and Dibbs to ad valorem,
auties and Reid to sugar and other Custom House
imposts.
®! en the tar - off Canterbury Times
(Christchurch, M.L.) has got hold of that har-
rowing idea propounded by the Sydney anti-
Federalists, that, because women have votes
m o. A. and not in the other provinces,
A. will have twice the voting-power
of the other provinces in proportion
to population. The fact that every pro-
vince is allotted its members in the
i ederal Lower House according 1 to
its population (men, women and child-
ren all counted), and that S.A.’s
seven members will still be only seven
whether they are elected by manhood-
sutirage, or man- woman-child-and-dog
a j") 6 ’ certainl y looks clear enough.
And the further provision that, at a
referendum, only half the votes of the
man-and-woman-suffrage states shall be
counted ought to make the rest of the case
comprehensible even to the worst variety of idiot.
Sydney D.T. erred grievously in starting
its anti-Bill yell so frantically and so soon.
Already it is well-nigh pumped out, breathless
with lying, and so short of expedients that it has
o rope-m ex-prize-fighters to bear political testi-
mony to the multitude.
At first convenience when N.S.W. Assem-
bly meets, a return should be asked for showing
what additions have been made to the list of life
railway-passes during the past three years. Some
queer people now exhibit this .badge of “ dis-
•mguished public service.”
A patent proof that Kingston and col-
eagues are not afraid of the people is given in the
tact that during last year, by the efforts of police
en AA? oStmen s P ecial] y told off for the duty, over
<JU,OOO names were added to S.A. Assembly rolls
which now contain 160,000 voters.
W.S. WALES’S TWO NEW IDOLS.
And the greater of these is?
The firing-out of Cowley from the Speaker’s
chair of Queensland Assembly looks as if the star
of Boodle was on the wane. Cowley was a useful
Speaker. No man could suspend the whole Labor-
party for alleged “ disorderly conduct ” more
promptly than he, and for shutting down on any
remark which was unpleasant to the Fat Man
Ministry he had no equal. Cowley dragged the
Boodle Ministry out of many a tight place and he
will be greatly missed.

The inner influences of Q. politics can be
suggested by saying that had Byrnes continued
premier, Glassey would have remained leader of
Opposition. Dickson, like Nelson, hates Glassey.
In Queensland particularly the leader of the Govt,
nas often been a powerful factor in the setting up
and knocking down of the Opposition chief.
Jack Gordon, who was one of the S.A.
Convention delegates, says his profession (law)
will prevent him giving up local bread-winning
tor federal politics, and so, when Kingston,
Play ford, and Holder go away, he intends to stop
at home, transfer his services from the Council to
the Assembly, and pick up the vacant Premier-
snip.
it likely that the State Parliaments
will reduce their numbers ? ” cries John Haynes,
as a wildly irrelevant argument for provincialism.
Well, the oldest Parliament in Australasia is just
about 50 years of age, and already two out of the
seven Legislatures have reduced the number of
their members. Perhaps that has some bearing
on the frantic John’s case.
Sydney D.T. reaches out desperately in-
deed when it “interviews" Mr. L. Foley the
pugilist, on “ the downfall of Sydney ” under the
Constitution Bill. Most Sydneyites, while cheer-
fully acknowledging Mr. Laurence Foley as a
competent authority on cross-counters and biffs
on the jaw, are somewhat indisposed to accept
him as an oracle on Constitutional affairs.
One little two-seated S.A. country con-
stituency—the Burra—is represented by one man
who has been Treasurer four times, and another
who has had that office three times. And both of
them are local-born, and neither is much pasb 50.
It illustrates the lightning changes in S.A.
politics—until Kingston consolidated the Liberal
forces and bound the Labor-men to him.
The Kingston (S.A.) Govt, completes its
sixth year of office on Friday, June 16, which is
the week before Parliament meets. Its original
members were Kingston, Playford, Cockburn,
Holder, Gordon, and Gilien. Of these, Playford
and Cockburn in succession have been made
Agents-General, Gillen is dead, and Gordon re-
signed over the wretched Hospital dispute.
Premier Dickson has informed Q. Parlia-
ment that the present session is to be devoted to
Federation only; so, apparently, plain Dickson,
the bald house-agent, is- going to really make an
effort in the cause of union. And, as for M‘ll-
- who used to pose as the great brass god of
tne movement, there is talk of raising a subscrip-
tion to pay that fallen Joss’s expenses back from
Lurope, so that he can lift up the remnant of his
curse and influence in the cause of Disunion-at-
any-Price.
The Kingston Govt. (S.A) is as hard-up as
ever for lawyers’ support—or should it be as for-
tunate as ever in being without it ? Of the 54
members of Assembly, the Ministry can rely on
the support of, say, 31—and Kingston himself is
the solitary lawyer of the crowd. Of the other
23, four only are lawyers—Downer, Glynn (a
doubtful quantity always), Homburg (ditto), and
a new man, Yon Doussa. Apart from Glynn,
there isn’t a University graduate, not even a
licentiate in medicine, in the House.
The S.A. Referendum on Household Suf-
frage at Council elections produced 48,936 votes in
favor, 33,830 against, and 11,094 informal, almost
all the latter being voting-papers on which the
Household Suffrage question was left unanswered.
So the good old Tory-party rises to wrangle that the
noes ’ and the informal votes added together are
only 4000 less than the affirmative vote, and that
when the people who didn’t get to the poll at all’
and the dead people, and the imbeciles, and the
dogs and cats, and th© people wjho aren J t born yet
are added, S.A. gives a clear majority J against
Council reform.
ThbN.S.W. Federal poll will mean much
to the Kingston (S.A.) Govt. Playford feels that
his talents call for a wider sphere than can be
found in looal politics, and if Australian Union is
nprf^ aJOri i y h V v J II calml .V await his ohance to

present instance.
Premier Reid has now set himself to show
Sydney Daily Telegraph what his power is on the
piattorm. It will be an interesting struggle, and
ill size-up the value of the different factors in the
various Tree trade victories. We know what
ueorge plus the Telegraph did. We will now
see what George minus the Telegraph can do.
■out it can only be manifested on the platform—
Decause at the referendum ballot-box it will be
treorge minus the Telegraph but plus Barton and
-P eaeration. But it is certain that the Telegraph
will nnd that the Premier has not been called
George Hustings ” Reid for nothing.
The Sydney provincial organ keeps digging
up, as an argument against Federation, that luck-
less last-year’s declaration of Statistician Coghlan:
• not know of any country in the world in which the
™v™ue, stated as an average ad-valorem,
ported 8 *° 27 Per ° ent ‘ 0n the whole of the % oods im-
And in the latest edition of Coghlan’s own “ Sta-
tistics of the Seven Colonies,” which was in circu-
lation at the time of that misguided remark, this
appeared : ‘ Tasmania (1896), imports <£1,192,410 :
net customs revenue, <£328,919. Equal to over
27i per cent.” And Coghlan “ didn’t know.”
Tas. Agent-General Fysh has cabled Pre-
mier Braddon asking permission to accept a seat
on the directorate of the Great Western Railway
syndicate. In view of the Premier’s own flirting
with syndicates and the loaning of his name to
various ventures, The Bulletin hardly sees how
he can refuse Fysh’s application to do a little
guinea-pigging. The only possible bar to the
appointment is the fact that the Railway co.
has forfeited its rights under the Act, which
rights cannot be re-instated until Parliament
meets (May 30), therefore it would appear inde-
cent for the Agent-General to take under his
protection a co. that is practically outlawed.
Capt. Russell, leader of the Tory Opposi-
tion in M.L., assures the people : “ I never ob-
-jected to the principle of the Old Age Pensions
Bill, and nothing would be further from my
thoughts than to repeal it even if I got the oppor-
tumty ” Which is very beautiful indeed—only as
Russell voted and spoke against the Old Age
Pensions Bill at every opportunity his assurance
doesn t seem to be worth the oxygen it took to
utter it, And his promise that he won’t repeal
THE “P.M.G.” ON HIS BIKE .
the Pension Law if he gets into power wouldn’t
sell for 2£d. He doesn’t need to repeal it. It is
on!y a temporary Act and will expire automatic-
ally without any repealing. Unless Russell will
furnish his solemn oath in writing that he will
renew the law if he is in ppwer the above effusive
promise is only a whited sepulchre—and not much
of that.
The Advances to Settlers “Act, having
weathered all storms, is now in operation in N.S.
Wales. The Board established in Sydney re-
ceived in one week applications for ,£60,000 in
loans from <£lo to £2OO. The principle is far from
being the novelty in N.S.W. which its opponents
have been, constantly maintaining 1 . In the partly-
nominated and partly-elected N.S.W\ Legislature
of 1843, the wool and cattle growers, then mone-
tarily embarrassed as selectors are now, were
treated to a similar Bill at the hands of Richard
Windeyer, father of the late Judge W. A Land
Board was appointed ; the squatter who wished
to obtain a loan applied to it; the Board valued
his property and gave him a State-credit amount-
ing to one-half. That was the scheme, at least,
but it didn’t quite come off. The Governor of the
day withheld the royal assent, and, as communi-
THE MOUNTAIN AND MAHOMET.
“People take more interest in a cricket-match
than in Federation.”
Then, why not let Georgie and Toby make the
best of it and address meetings of free and intelli-
gent electors from the different scoring-boards?
cation was then slow, the crisis passed before
further steps were taken.
When Sydney Daily Telegraph puts
Premier Reid and Joe Cook and other present
federalists of the Cornstalk Ministry in the
witness-box by quoting their anti-federal utter-
ances of a year ago—what does it prove ? If the
Pill isn’t the same Bill (and the Telegraph some-
times says it is the same bad old Bill and some-
times that it is a worse new one) then the circum-
stances may account for their change of front. If
it is the same Bill then they may have told the
truth last June (as the Telegraph said) and be
telling untruths now (as the Telegraph says). Or
they may have told untruths last June (and the
lelegraph may then have perjured itself by say-
mg that what they said was true) and be telling
truth now (consequently the Telegraph may be
again perjuring itself by saying that what they
say now isn’t true). This paragraph is recom-
mended as a test in cases of suspected intoxica-
tion. Any person who can clearly explain the
situation is sober enough to pass muster.
Louis von Doussa, elected for Mt. Barker
(S. A.) by 30 votes over the second Liberal candi-
date, is a talkative solicitor with hopelessly-
retrograde views. Yet in ’B7 he worked most
enthusiastically to put Dr. Cockburn in for the
district, and he succeeded. However, he soon
recanted, and until the doctor’s departure for
England last year, “Yon’’worked with great
eagerness to put him out again. He was born
in the district, and has lived there all his life,
but rias only just managed to scrape past the
fvingstonian who stood third on the poll, the
senior member being also a Liberal.
Theodore Uninack—“ Ten-bob ” Unmack
—a sour person who once was Minister of Some-
thmg in Queensland, croaks on the pallid bust of
Pallas against the Federation Bill. He told his
hearers that Queensland would lose, among
other things, £400,000 paid as duty on Eng-
lish and foreign goods brought from the other
provinces. As it happens the £400,000 will
still belong to Queensland ; clause 93 of the
Commonwealth Bill distinctly provides that
the State consuming the goods shall be credited
with the duty. Before this ghostly ten-bob Ger-
man again takes the anti-Federation stump lie
should get a copy of the Bill and try to under-
stand it.

The cure of piles by the new “ Canalin ”

“Saved ” : “ Has one aspect of the Sydney Safe
, J;P ° sit occurred to you? Most people insure against
loss by fire and receive money compensation for property
destroyed. But there are some things-valuable paners
| elr o f om ®: etc.—which can never be replaced, and P the
loss of which means a fortune. The Safe Deposit for a
W P of ra »i Ve y su i l1 * not on ’y insures against the

What is a guinea or two a year compared with a docu-

in Ash-street, back of Palings, off George-street.* P
the Union Co -’ s s - s - Tekapo at
Maroubra Bay, near Sydney, last week, keeps
alive the tradition of the “unlucky ‘ T.’” which
has been an initial of ill omen to steamers con-
nected with the Maoriland trade. The list now
includes the Tararua, Taiaroa, Taupo, Tauranga,
Triumph, fasmama and Tekapo. The late Capt.
Pairchild, for over 30 years skipper to the Maori-
land Government, and who never once “ touched
bottom when it was decided to give the name of
lutanekai to the new Government yacht re-
marked, Mr. Seddon wants to see if it’s possible
for me to wreck a ship.”
The long-missing steamer Perthshire has
been sighted at last, drifting helplessly about be-
tween the Auckland and Wellington tracks. The
general remarks about the Perthshire illustrate a
curious kink in the public mind. To speculations
about her prooable loss, the invariable replies were
either Yes, but fortunately she has no pas-
sengers on board”; or else, “How many pas-
lfe7 e ‘<Vb^> boar m • T!r ne \ Then > whh i-e-
-{• > J-hats a blessing!” Apparently sailors’
lives don t count, fortunately she had passengers
on board or the popular deity might have neg-
lected her, too. It is the same kink that allows
the compulsory-inspection clause of Navigation
Acts to apply to passenger-ships only.
Chief-Justice Griffith’s chairmanship of
Barton and Deakm’s pro-Bill meeting in Brisbane
proves how tenaciously he adheres to the views
he expressed as to the non-party character of
federation in the Sydney Convention of years
ago. Then he said that office should not hinder
any Australian from takingthe part his convictions
favored in respect to Federation. His views
however, don’t commend themselves to the Chief
Justices of other provinces.

Stevenson, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), who died
suddenly the other day by the roadside, is the
first parliamentary martyr to anti-Federal deter-
mination. Though in feeble health, he insisted
on touring his straggling oonstitueney of North-
umberland in angry altercation with Billites, and
his heart gave way. He was an ideal M.P. of the
roads-and-bridges order—the type of which a
Federal Parliament will know nothing.

The Bulletin lets “ Run-Out ” indulge in lugu-
briousi prophecy Amusing for the Agk’s Oracle to set
down (11 5 99) that “ he had staked his reputation as a
judge on his statement that he could not believe it
possible for Laver to be a success with the bat in big
cricket on the slower English wickets.” “Mid-on’s”
reputation as a judge ! When Trot.t’s last Australian XI
was being chosen “Mid-On” untiringly advocated the
claims of Eady, partly because he could play cricket a
little, and mainly on account of his “ social qualities”—
as he expressed it. And all the while Turner then Aus-
tralia’s best bowler, remained unchosen. Again when
the present team was being picked “ Mid-On ” ignored
Giffen as a past number, and boomed Worrall as a rising
star - Worrall, one of the failures of the Australian XI. of
88, probably the weakest team that ever visited England
Yet, despite these achievements, “Mid-On” cavils at
Laver’s inclusion, and gravely talks of staking his repu-
tation on Laver’s failure. For the reason that the present
team does not comprise Australia’s full strength, many
judges with reputations expect' it to go down every time
it meets England’s best. Worrall, Laver, and Trimmer
are “passengers” who can thank newspaper and social
influences for their presence in England. When the Aus
tralian XL of ’99 returns home utterly beaten, the public
who provide the gate-money will want to know why Giffen
and M’Kibbin were not in the team, and why cricketers
were not chosen in preference to newspaper and drawing-
room men. b

. Steeplechasing threatens to die out altogether
in Sydney, for, when the old ’chasers die-and they can’t
in the natural order of things, live much longer-there
won’t be a nag left capable of completing the course.
The Steeple at Randwick on Sat. was an absolute farce
Four out of five starters were new-comers, two of whom
promptly fell in the first half-mile, the third laboriously
climbed his fences for a round, and the fourth (Echo)
stood up and performed so brilliantly that YVhitefoot 11..
aged and slow as a top, was able to beat him by furlongs.’
Poor old Whitefoot has been running in Sydney steeples
for years and now stops almost to a walk in a finish, so
what sort of an embryo G.N. candidate must Echo be?
it is strange that some Sydney owner doesn’t step in and
help himself to the shekels that await the first man who
letches along anything like a decent steeple-horse.

Old-time showman Stuart Cumberland,
after playing many parts (including that of Uit-
lamlers' champion) bobs up in London as the
newest member of the Stock Exchange.
The man who turned Queen’s evidence
against six companions accused of outraging
a girl at North Shore 27 years ago, died last week
at Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, from self-
inflicted wounds—his second attempt at suicide.
The death-sentences were all commuted.
An American female missionary in the city
of Nanking, recently married a Mandarin of the
seventh rank whom she had converted. Her
action caused a scandal in missionary circlps and
she was “sacked.” The lady has now started a
rival establishment, and intends appealing to
American churches for support.
The two last commutations make five
death-sentences—all for different offences—an-
nulled by N.S.W. Executive in one fortnight.
Time N.S.W Judges gave up shedding tears and
pathetic prayers over victims behind the spikes.
Indeed, if death-sentences are to be saved from
degenerating into burlesque, Judges should with-
hold them until the will of the Executive is
known.
“ British fair play ” was strong at the
Melb. meeting of sympathy with the Uitlanders.
Mayor M'Eacharn, who expects a knighthood
shortly, was respectably enthusiastic about “our
kinsmen across the seas,” and the lead of the
Cockney Highlander was followed in a wild, up-
roarious strain by the rank-and-file. Then there
rose a quiet-looking young man in spectacles, who
evidently knew what he was talking about, and
who managed to get out several nasty and telling
truths about the British cry from Boerland before
the meeting rose and howled him into siience.
Then Mayor M‘Eacharn tried to block the speaker
by asking him if he were a British subject, and,
hearing an affirmative reply, the meeting saw no
hope but to prevent the other side being heard by
the good old British-fair-play method of continu-
ous hooting. ; 1)

THE BEAUTY OF THE
MASSEY-HARRIS
BICYCLE
Has always been famous. This year
we have surpassed all previous
efforts and produced a bicycle as
near perfection as our skill
and the practically unlimited re-
sources of our great factories can
make it. The design is elegant
and graceful, and every detail
of workmanship and finish has been
brought to tempting ideality.
ONE GRADE ONLY
THAT THE HIGHEST.
We confine our efforts and the efforts
of every one of the 600 skilled
mechanics in our factories to the
perfecting of One model, one
only; and no maker who scatters his
energies over half a dozen models
can hope to compete with us. For
years we have tested, improved and
perfected this one model of
Massey-Harris Bicycle
until, we believe, it is superior in
every way to any other bicycle that
has yet been built.

The Falling Leaves
Give Warning ofWinler
So the falling of the hair tells
of the approach of age and declin-
ing power. No matter how barren
the tree nor how leafless it may
seem, you confidently expect leaves
again. And why?
Because there is Life
at the Roots.
So you need not worry about the
falling of your hair, the threatened de-1
parture of your youth and beauty. And why?
Because if there is a spark of life re-
maining in the roots of the hair
Ayor's
Hair Vigor
will arouse it into healthy activity. The
hair ceases to come out: it begins to grow:
and the glory of youth is restored to you.

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlouodtne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability, to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
The Tonga news published in Sydney last
month turns the mind back to the days when
Shirley Baker was Premier. That bitter Wes-
leyan was the beginner of the trouble. The Rev.
Baker raised a loan of .£3OOO from a German firm
trading in Tonga to replenish the coffers of the
Tongan church. The security he gave for this
loan consisted of I O TJ’s signed by certain boss
islanders and redeemable in copra. But only a
few of the notes have yet been redeemed. Owing
to Baker’s position as Premier the trading co.
endeavored to make the Tongan Govt, responsible,
but the late King George repudiated liability. A
German war-vessel was then enlisted, and has
ever since been hanging around screaming for
the money, and sometimes receiving a trifle on
account, but running up other accounts at the
same time. The present King, the long, lanky
youth who picked up general knowledge at Newing-
ton College, Sydney, is more easily cornered than
King George, and is besides so bewildered over a
long-standing marriage difficulty that it is impos-
sible to forecast whether he will fight or resign.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
El i zabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
Melb. Herald having recently asked to
whom would the spouse of seven husbands belong
in the “spirit world,” has been swamped by a
flood of “intelligence” from the astral plane and
other regions beyond the jurisdiction of the
divorce court. Some of the correspondents h ve
invoked the opinion of departed spirits on the
point, and one seer, upon the authority of a
“meejum,” asserts that everybody shall find in
spirit-land a true affinity, irrespective of all mun-
dane connections. In support he quotes Robert
Burns, who, “now forever happy in Paradise
with the young woman known as Highland
Mary,” forwards per “meejum” aforesaid, the
following “ pome ”: —
“ Tell them that, as I passed frae earth,
Ma angel-lassie, crown’d wi’ flowers,
Met me wi’ glowing love-lit torch
An’ led me to the Nuptial bowers :
That a’ we dream’d o’ wedded bliss—
An’ mair—was meeted to us there,
Whar sweeter was my deary’s kiss
Than the flowery banks o’ Ayr :
Whar love’s celestial fountains play’d,
An’ rosebuds burst, an’ seraphs sang,
An’ myrtle twined our couch to shade,
I clasp’d the ane I mourn’d sae lang ;
An’ whilst by angel-harp -i was play’d
The bonny bridal serenade,
Tho’ nae gown’d priest the kirk-rite said,
Burns was wi’ Highland Mary wed.
There’s nae destroying death-frost there,
To nip the hope-buds ere they bloom :
The bridal tour is through the spheres—
Eternity’s the honeymoon ! ”
E YOU
A BAD LEE
with W°unds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies jh>u have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
mav be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN

Aifaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12,1898.
To llkrr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it mv duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
1 suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and 1 sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, hut to
do all that was claimed for them. 1 have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

recommended the Aifaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to'all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —Having suffered for some time from a com-
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which I took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

PAIN AND SUFFERING DISAPPEARING.
„ „ _ . „ May 6, 1899.
To Mr. S. A. Palmer,
Vitadatio Institute,
„ . Bourke-street, Melbourne.
Dear Sir,—
In November, 1898, I was seized with a violent
attack of muscular rheumatism in the left arm and
side, which continued getting- worse, until I could not
straighten my arm, also could not get any sleep.
I was attended l>3 r a doctor, and received no benefit
therefrom.
I also tried many other remedies, which did me no
good.
About the end of March I was advised to try “ VITA-
DATIO,” and I did so.
I am glad to say that after taking a few doses I began
to get better, and now after four bottles I am cured,
and I feel quite “ A New Man.”
I am sending this testimonial, and I wish you to
make the best use you can of it, as I wish others who
are in the same condition that I was to try Vitadatio,
and get cured.

Mr. Palmer,
Dear Sir, —
The case of M'Minn is a genuine one ; the doctor was
•in a fix about it, but said an operation was absolutely
necessary.
I myself diagnosed it “ hydatids.” and assured the
father that Vitadatio would in less than two days prove
me to be correct. You have the father’s testimony to
that effect.
Yours faithfully,
JOHN HEPWORTH,
Eclectic Chemist.
Palmerston North, N.Z.,
25th April, 1899.
Mr. Palmer (VITADATIO)
Dear Sir,—On Bth August, 1898, my son, aged 12,
complained of swelling on his right side ; on examina-
tion by a doctor it was pronounced to be “ hydatids on
the liver,” and an operation was ordered to take place
immediately for the removal of the growth.
Meeting Mr. Hepworth, eclectic chemist of this town,
to whom I mentioned the trouble, he recommended me
to try a bottle of Vitadatio before having recourse to an
operation, which would be necessarily attended with
more or less risk.
I procured a bottle, and within an hour after the first
dose an improvement in the symptoms was perceptible,
and within a period of two or three weeks he was per-
fectly well, and has remained so, enjoying excellent
health without any return of the former'trouble.
I obtained for him altogether four bottles, and the
trial proved most satisfactory indeed; far beyond my
anticipations.

S. A. PALMER, Esq.,
45-47 Bourke-street.
Dear Sir, —
I have been hesitating for the last six months relative
to the actual merits of your famous medicine, “ Vita-
datio,” and although I am anxious at all times to re-
commend any sterling recipe for complaints similar to
that from which I have suffered for the last ten years,
namely, sciatic rheumatism, I, knowing that my opinion
and recommendation would carry weight amongst a
wide circle of acquaintances, felt I must actually satisfy
myself beyond the slightest doubt before expressing an
opinion, good, bad, or indifferent.
I have during my long career travelled pretty well all
over the world, tried many prescriptions, and acted
upon medjcal advice from gentlemen of repute and
standing.
I must say now conscientiously that although I have
not been at all consistent regarding diet, &c., during
the time I have taken “ Vitadatio,” still I have derived
greater benefit from the same than from any other
medicine. Each attack of sciatic rheumatism gradually
lessens in its intensity, and without doubt is rapidlv
being eradicated from my system.
I think it a duty to give this testimonial, and fer-
vently hope that those who have suffered like myself
will be equally successful in obtaining relief. With
good wishes for the future.
Obediently yours,
FRED. B. NORTON.
'yiRTUE AND MERIT THEIR OWN REWARD.
“The greatest man is he who troubles the least
about the verdict that may be passed upon him by
posterity, but who finds in doing good honest work to
the best of his ability, under existing conditions its
own exceeding great reward.”
VITADATIO, the great healer of diseases, has earned
the great reward entirely on its virtues and merits.
VITADATIO has a host of living witnesses all over
Australasia, and the fame of it is already spreading
over the empire. s
And why V
Simply because it is an honest, genuine article it
has cured incurable diseases. It has cured Consumption
Cancer, Hydatids, Bright's Disease, Congestion of
Liver, Inflammation of Kidneys, Diabetes, and manv
diseases hitherto the dread of humanity. J
Many cynical and misanthropical people say “Ohl
it’s no use telling us it will cure ail these.”
We say it has cured them, and we further emphati-
cally affirm it will cure them, and, further still vve can
submit living witnesses and tangible proofs.
The fact is, an angel from heaven wouldn’t convince
the cynic, the misanthrope, or egotist.

These Bitters I recommend in DYSPEPSIA, CHRONIC RHEUMATISM and CUTA-
NEOUS AFFECTIONS. The action of Buchu on the human frame is more-effectual on all
diseases of the Kidney and Bladder than any other herbal plant; and it also assists persons suffer-
ing from Skin Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and inducing perspiration.

BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like others in overdoses. It has a remark-
able influence on the Liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it when deranged,
and restores healthy evacuations in cases of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D. : —BBBB—I find these Bitters a most valuable and wholesome
Tonic, being pure and strengthening ; a stimulant to the Liver, assisting Digestion. I therefore
thus recommend them.

Two of a Trade.
That two of a trade seldom agree is a common
saying. Its weakness, however, resides in the fact
that it is a cavilling, sneering saying. The idea
sought to be conveyed is that the disagreement is
the outcome of reciprocal jealousy. While that is
likely, it is not a necessary, or even a philosophical,
inference. Two of a trade may easily see reasons
for an honest difference of opinion to which the
outsider is blind. Again, two of a trade may agree
and both be wrong—on a point, of course, con-
nected with their own industry. Some years ago
there was high debate over the question whether a
painting, exhibited in Paris, was an original
Velasquez or a copy. Half the artists and
connoisseurs in Europe got hot under the collar
about it. It was one or the other—so they said.
Later on the fact came out. It was neither an
original nor a copy ; it was a replica. The experts
were mistaken. And so runs speculative judg nent
in everything.
Here is the case of two doctors ; both, doubtless,
competent men. If they were wrong, or if only
one was wrong—but let us have the story first.
It comes from a reputable source, and is well
corroborated.
“In March, 1891,” says the relater, “I had a
severe attack of influenza, which prostrated me
for two months. After this I could not get up my
strength. My appetite was poor, and what little
I did eat gave me much pain at the chest and
around the heart. Sharp, cutting pains in the re-
gion of the heart seized me every now and again,
sometimes so bad I feared I was going to die. At
night I got little or no sleep on account of wind,
which rose into my throat until I fairly gasped
for breath. During the painful attacks of my
complaint perspiration would stand in beads upon
my face.
“ I soon lost strength to that extent I could not
stand. Indeed, I was weak as a child. I was
often so dizzy I had to catch hold of something to
keep me from falling. Several times these attacks
have come upon me at concerts, obliging my friends
to conduct me home. As time passed on I grew
more and more feeble, and abandoned all hope of
ever being well and strong again.
“ I had two doctors attending me who prescribed
medicines ; which, however, eased me only for a
time and then I was as bad as ever.
“ One doctor said I had pleurisy ; the other said
I had heart disease.
“For two and one-half years I lingered along,
nearly as much dead as alive, all my relatives and
friends thinking 1 would not recover. In Novem-
ber, 1893, a book was left at my house in which I
read of a case like mine having been cured by
Mother Seigel’s Syrup. My wife procured me a
bottle from the Provincial Drug Stores in West-
gate-street, and the first bottle gave me so much
relief that I continued with the medicine. I could
then eat well, and the food agreed with me, the
pain around the heart soon ceasing.
“ In a short time my strength returned, and I
got back to my work well and vigorous. Since
then I have been in the best of health,.. You are at
liberty to publish this statement and refer tome.”
—(Signed) William Henry Jervis, 48 Rendlesham
Road, All Saints, Ipswich, November 13th, 1897.
One of Mr. Jervis’s doctors pronounced his com-
plaint to be pleurisy; the other said it was heart
disease. Were they both right, or both wrong?
Or was one right and the other wrong? In the
latter case—which one ? Judging from the symp-
toms as set forth by Mr. Jervis the probability is
that both were right— as far as they went.
The sac or bag which surrounds the heart (called
the pericardium), and the sac in which the lungs
rest (called the pleurae), are parts of the lymphatic
system ; which is the especial abiding place and
stamping ground of the kind of poison, produced
by the' diseased digestive system, and the cause of
rheumatism, gout, pleurisy, and heart disease.
Now, after (if not before) his attack of influenza
Mr. Jervis suffered from acute dyspepsia with
torpid liver, which engendered the poison that set
up a mild form of both pleurisy and heart dis-
order. When the real and underlying ailment of
all—the dyspepsia—w as cured by Mother Seigel’s
Syrup these supplementary or consequential
troubles vanished, as might be expected.
So we see that - strange as it may seem—two of
a trade can differ and both be right.*

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —I had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. ' At this stage I was pro-
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Ila’pin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments,
without benefit. I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking, three bottles of th s medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
the Rev. John Sinclair, Myers-street, Geelong, and 59
other leading residents.
Prepared only and sold wholesale and retail by the pro-
prietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria.

they call it A MIRACLE I
Doctors give him up!
Hospitals discharge him INCURABLE!
A DARK AND GLOOMY PROSPECTI
A RAY OF SUNSHINE and a PERFECT RESTORATION.
(by ottr special reporter.)
What is locally
Considered a Miraclo
has lately been performed at Silver Water,
sometimes called “ Ibbettown,” so many
lb Jetts live there, a prettily-situated village
near Auburn, and about 10 miles from
Sydney, on the main suburban line.
News of the perfect restoration of health
to Mr. William lbhett having got abroad,
we dispatched one of our reporteis to the
district to institute a searching investigation
into the case, and find out
The Absolute Truth
from Mr. lbbett and the neighbours, who
appear to have made the case one of general
interest in the neighbourhood for some time
past, for it has been a drily subject of
conversation amongst the many people
acquainted with the particulars.
lhe reporter could not make the people
“® Questioned understand which member of
the lbbett family he wanted to see till he
Mentioned the Illnes3
of the man in question, at which the re-
quire! house was at once pointed out as that
of the man the doctors
Could not cure, and Hospitals
turned out as Inctsrable,
hut Clements Tonic had
Thoroughly Restored.
The reporter was fortunate enough to
obtain the interview he sought, when he
ask(d : —“Will you do me the kindness, Mr.
lbbett, to tell me how your complaint first
started, how it progressed, and how you
finally recovered ? ”
“I will,” answered Mr. lbbett. “It
commenced with seve e pains in the head,
and afterwards pains down the neck and
spine came on. 'then all at once I lost my
appetite. I could’nt look at my food, the
very sight of it turned me sick. My
digestion went all wrong. What little
I did eat (and I forced myself to eat some-
thing now and then to keep body and soul
together) gave me great pain. I only took
soft food, but even this would not digest,
but
Turned Sour and Fermented
in my stomach, causing me to suffer terribly
from wind and flatulence. Besides, I could
get no sleep. I did not get, as a rule, more
than an hour’s sleep a night, and that in
disturb d, uneasy snatches, each of short
duration, which did me no good at all. I
had to
Give up my Billet
at the Auburn Meat Works, and I used to
sit all day long in the chair feeling nerveless
and languid, with no energy or desire to
move. The pains in my back got worse
daily, especially along the spine. I got
most distressingly weak, and strangely
nervous. I have been accustomed to be in
the works with the w'hirl and crash of
machinery going on all round me, and I
never suffered the least inconvenience, but
now every sound went
Through me like a Knife,
and would startle and give me such a shock
that I should almost fall to the ground, and
I trembled like a leaf ”
“ Why didn’t you see a doctor’ ”
“I diil and what use wa id I had
geveral, and obeyed their orders, and took
their physic. To what end ? I only got
worse and worse. Finally they gave me up.
They said they could do nothing more for
me, and they had done nothing then ; and
one of them told me that he had given me
medicines strong enough to kill a horse.
This, I believe, was a fact, but it evidently
was not the treatment my disease required,
for it entirely failed to relieve me.
“ You must have got pretty low-spirited.”
“Of course. I became very much de-
pressed. Everything ahead
Looked Dark and Gloomy
to me. My Fiends tried in yain to cheer
me up, hut nothing could give me hope, as
every day my disease increased. I got very
thin. I w’as like a skeleton. I fell away
in a very short Time ft om 10 stone 4 lbs.
to 8 stone 5 lbs., and my face was pale and
colourless.
“ Did you suffer in any other way that
you’ve not yet mentioned?”
“Yes; my kidneys were affected, and a
dull, dragging pain in the small of the back
was continually distressing me (the doctor
said this was a sign of kidney disease), and
my water was very high coloured, but I
don’t care to go into further particulars as
to my kidney symptoms; but I can only
assure you they caused me great distress.
As a last resort, on my wife’s suggestion, I
was taken to the Hospital, Sydney. I
thought that if it was possible to cure me
at all I should have the best chance there.
Qhe doctors gave me a very careful examin-
ation. They sounded me all over and took
my temperature, but they could make
nothing of my case. I beli ve that they
treated me there
Foi* Kidney disease.
But none of the treatment I received at the
Hospital relieved me, and the pain in my
back whilst at the Hospital was agonising
After being there some weeks I was at last
Discharged as incurable.
The doctors said they could do nothing for
me. My wife and friends were very much
grieved that I had to return home without
relief. As for myself, I fully thought I was
going home to die. I gave up all hope of
ever getting on my feet again.”
“What induced you to resort to Clements
Tonic ?”
It was recommended to me by my cousin.
She said she had heard of someone in whom,
so far as some of the symptoms went, had
been afflicted as I was, and who had been
Entirely Restored to Health
by that remedy. She was so positive that
I got my wife to obtain some Clements Tonic
for me. I had, however, very little hope of
its being of any service, but you know how
a drowning man
Catches at a Straw.
My wife bought a bottle and I commenced
to take it regularly.”
“ How did it act in your case ?”
“First, by relieving the awful pains in my
back Then, as I continued to take it, I felt
my nervous system gradually get a better
tone. I was not so fretful and irritable, and
I began to sleep much better. I was soon
glad to find my digestion greatly improve.
Clements Tonic prevented my food going
sour and disagreeing with me, and I was
able to once mere eat solids freely and
without suffering afterwards, as I had been
accustomed to.”
“ And what about your kidney trouble ?"
“ I found a most
Distinct Beneficial Effect
upon my kidneys. It didn’t take long for
Clements Tonic to make those organs work
properly again, and to rid me of all disagri e
able symptoms which had formerly trouble*
me.”
“ You, of course, continued Clement*
Tonic?”
“Yes, you may be sure I didn’t miss a dose.
From the time of starting I put all othei
medicines aside. Day by day 1 got
Stronger and Stronger?
I was able to look hopefully to the future,
and my depression had vanished as though
it never had been. No longer was I dull
and heavy in the day time, but was bright
and lively. Once I started to get better the
rate of my recovery was astonishing. I
Came on hand over hand,
so to speak. Clements Tonic gives you a
great appetite and no mistake, and I ate
splendidly and put on flesh again rapidly.”
“ Your relations and neighbours must
have been surprised at the way in which you
were restored to health ?”
“ I should just say they were—you just
ask them about me and they will tell you
all about it.
All my Troubles Vanished
under the influence of Clements Tonic, and
I was able to go to work again, though till
I was completely strong I always took a
bottle with me when I went to woi'k, I
found it so invigorating.”
“ And your health now j”
“I am now quite cured, and as strong
and well as ever in my life, for which J
thank Clements Tonic. If anyone wants to
know more about my case, they have only
to call on me and I shall be only too pleased
to tell them how Clements Tonic brought
me back to health and strength when the
doctors gave me up and
The Hospital turned me out
as an incurable, and I thought my days were
numbered."
“ May we publish all you’ve said to me?'
“ Yes ; you are quite welcome to do so.’’

M'Kormic’s Woe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas in a township’s single street,
He sat upon a log,
His swag was lying at his feet,
As also was his dog;
His brow was furrowed deep with care,
And in his ancient eye
Was woe untold, and tears were there
He did not wish to dry.
’Twas my belief that cankered grief
Was gnawing him. My q ueries brief
He answered with a sigh.
The bushmen in the public “cussed,”
And drank their pewters off.
A “ drunk ” was sleeping in the dust,
Another in the trough.
We saw the foaming liquor, heard
The pump’s eternal clink,
And roaring shouters pass the word :
“Say whatyer goin’ ter drink ? ”
Yet like a stone he sat. I own
He breathed a hollow, awful groan,
But never stirred a wink !
His eye was dull, its glassy stare
Was pitiful to see.
At last his tale of grim despair
Confided he to me.
“ I was a drunkard, boss,” he said,
“ I had a famous thirst.
I loved the best of liquors red,
And well I loved the worst.
The whisky dear, and rum and beer,
Were my delight.” He maundered here
Just like a thing accurst.
“ If honest drinks were not to spare
It did not matter much ;
I took to washes for the hair,
And liniments, and such.
My reputation travelled far,
I won a great renown.
No man this side could breast the bar
And drink M’Kormic down.
But one sad day I went away,
Inveigled to a Home to stay
’Longside of Sydney town.
“ It was a celebrated place
Where fellows who get tight
Are soon deprived of every trace
Of whisky appetite.
They gave me mixtures made of gold,
And splashed the rum about,
And fed me full as I could hold—
I grew extremely stout.
The boss one night said I had quite
Renounced my horrid appetite.
Next day I paddled out.”
He shook his hands, he tore his hair,
His groans were wilder far,
And still his eye’s mesmeric stare
Was fixed upon the bar.
“Poor man,’’ I said, “ you suffer still
The craving you endured.
They failed to cure you—to fulfil
The promise that allured ? ”
He fetched a cry that pierced the sky.
“ It’s worse, it’s worse ! ” he groaned, “ for I
Oh Heaven ! lam cubed ! ”
EDWARD DYSON.
Daughter and Barometer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was a still, stifling night. Several loafers
lounged in the bar. A big fly bumped stupidly
along the ceiling, and a couple of kangaroo-dogs
made dull thumpings on the verandah as the fleas
tormented them. Minnie Parks, 14 years old,
attended to customers, standing on tiptoes to
roach bottles and glasses.
“Yer dad’s worse, ain’t ’e?” inquired a big
carter, leaning along the counter, and tracing his
name with some spilt liquor.
Minnie nodded.
A little man on a bench endeavored to look in-
telligent and make some remark ; he squinted
abominably in the attempt to keep both eyes
open, and with a vacuous smile began, “ I—l—yer
p ar but tremendous hiccoughs prevented
speech, and he subsided, though still keeping up
a pretence of being wide awake and sober.
Minnie stared at him solemnly. “He’s only
had three glasses,” she remarked with the con-
tempt born of the knowledge of what some men
can carry.
“ The doc.’s with Da, ain’t e ? ’
She nodded again and looked round anxiously,
her ear keenly alert for the doctor’s footstep. She
was a small slip of a creature, with a peaky face
and bright eyes. Her work in the shanty was
never at an end, and she had never known from
babyhood what it meant to be a careless, irrespon-
sible child.
Hearing the door open from the crazy room at
the back, she glanced anxiously at Ben. “ Tell
anyone to wait for me, if they come, will you ? ”
He nodded, and she disappeared noiselessly, and
crept after the doctor as he crossed the soft dust in
the roadway. He turned, feeling the touch of a
hand on his arm.
“It’s me, Minnie Parks. Is Dad better?’’she
whispered.
“ I can’t say he is, child. This hot weather is
against him. If it woidd only change’’—and he
glanced into the starlit sky, innocent of clouds.
“ If it changed d’ye think he’d get better ? ”
“ He’d have a chance.”
“ D’ye think it will change, doctor ? ” Her tone
was eager.
“ No, I don’t.”
“ You’ve done all you can, haven’t you, doctor ? ”
“ Yes, child ; his isn’t a case for doctors.” His
thoughts reverted to the sodden beast he had just
left, and a puzzled expression crossed his face.
He could hardly believe Minnie had much affec-
tion for such a creature. “ What’s worrying you,
child ? Let’s sit here, on this log, while I have a
smoke, and you tell me about it.”
The doctor was an old fellow, and he knew the
world pretty well, and it was to his credit that he
still believed in it to a certain extent. He felt
that something more than filial anxiety was at the
bottom of Minnie’s questions. “ Come, let’s hear
the trouble,” he said, kindly, and for answer
Minnie burst into tears.
“I don’t want it to change,” she sobbed. “I’m
a bad, wicked girl. I don’t want it to change,
because I don’t want him to get better. The
minister said I ought to love him, even if he did
beat me. But I hate him—l hate him ! ” The
words were repeated, not with the passion that
follows one act of cruelty, but with the cold
decision of acknowledged fact. “ I know I’ll go
to hell for being wicked ; but he hurt mo so. He
beat me; he pulled me round the room by the
ear. He kicked my puppy and killed it. My
mother died because he hit her when” She
paused, shaking with excitement, and with the
memory of the old horror of which she had never
before spoken to any one, and which it had taken
her many years to realise to the full. The picture
was sharp in her mind. The cowering woman,
her screams for mercy, her words, which the child
did not understand until years after. A kick, a
blow ! She shuddered, remembering it.
“ I say, Minnie Parks, yer wanted—two
whiskies! ” shouted Ben’s voice, and Minnie
darted off, wiping her eyes on her dress. The doc-
tor walked home slowly, and, as he opened his
door, muttered, “Thank Heaven, I can do no
more ; that is, if Heaven worries itself to any ex-
tent over a woman or girl being kicked to death.
If we were in a city, and could get ice and so on,
the brute ’d pull through ; as it is, he hasn’t
Buckley’s chance.”
And when the doctor rose the following morn-
ing, he and Minnie were probably the only people
glad to see the earth quivering under an already
intense heat.
Nevertheless, before evening came a change—
storm and rain and coolness.
But the man was dead.
POTTS.
Some anti-Federalists have reduced their
estimate of what N.S. Welshmen will have to pay
extra, from <£l 2s. fid. to £1 per head per annum.
Possibly the odd half-crown is for the registration
of George Pile’s dog.
Not long ago the Tasmanian Government
wanted a Chief Commissioner of Police for the
re-organised force, on the abolition of municipal
police, and it went for him to—the Benevolent
Asylum ! The particular qualification of the new
man is, that for some years he has ruled several
hundred old men and women, many of them im-
beciles. Also, he is a Volunteer captain or some-
thing. The fact that he has had long and
intimate acquaintance with “vags.” may count
for something.
The Melbourne Progressive Spiritualists
held their 51st anniversary the other day. It was
a mild shivoo—mediums were off color, and spirits
sulked. Mrs. Mellon was there. She said Sydney
was full of spirits—but didn’t venture an opinion
as to quality. This lady is stickin’ at the biz—real
old rock-Mellon, so to say. Like most of the cult,
she doesn’t seem a bit the worse for being hung up
as an impostor. Indeed, it suits spiritists to
get an advt. that way, now and again. Cissy
and Geordie, Mellon’s spooks, didn’t turn up on
the occasion. Perhaps they’re dead !
The presidentof Sydney Benevolent Society
announced, at a recent meeting of the board, that
the Premier was to be asked to ad vance £3OOO extra
(beyond the Govt, subsidy and grants, which
amount already to .£5000) in order to see the
society through the winter. The same board
published, the other day, an article on the de-
crease of poverty in Sydney, as compared with
previous years, so that its chance of securing
.£3OOO from the needy Reid is about equal to
Buckley’s. As a matter of fact, the cause of the
falling-off in the society’s figures is that the poor
decline to patronise the institution unless com-
pelled, and appeal to the Chief-Secretary’s Depart-
ment, whose sources of relief are just now taxed
to the uttermost.
The Wickedness of a Woman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir.—You are being heartlessly deceived by a false
woman and a pretended friend. Where does your wife
fjo on Thursday evenings when you are working back? I
am unknown to you, but I am, nevertheless, your sincere
—Wellwisiier.
“It’s a lie ! ” he thought, as he crumpled the
paper up in his hand and threw it away from him.
But he picked it up again, and spread it out' care-
fully on the office-table. “ Could it have any
truth in it?” No, he persuaded himself that he
did not believe it, but he put it carefully in his
pocket and took it home with him. Being a man,
the thought of who sent it did not much trouble
him—to a woman this would have been the first
consideration and its truth the next. He was
honest and unsuspicious, and fought with his doubt
all day and went home believing he had conquered,
but he unconsciously determined to watch his
wife closely. Genuine faith, once doubt-poisoned,
never does revive in its full strength. Uncon-
sciously his feeling towards her had changed, and
he himself dimly felt that he was acting. The
quick-witted, bright-faced little woman at home
noticed the change at once. The keen intuition of
a guilty conscience told her the cause. Each knew
the other’s part —but it was the heavy acting of a
man trying to do the right against the cunning
deception of a woman. The odds were unequal.
She searched his clothes, found the letter, warned
the Other Man, and was hot on “ Well wisher’s ”
trail.
Two days later her husband received another
letter:—
Sir, —The wicked deception still continues. Where is
your wife going next Tuesday afternoon ? —YVellwisher.
He might, honest man, have given little heed
to this letter; but on the dressing-table that
evening he saw this confirmatory note in his
wife's hand-writing, evidently ready for the post:
Dear Old Boy,—l will meet you in the Strand at 3. I
hope you have engaged our room for Thursday night.—
Yours very affectionately, Amy.
He was staggered. He would go at once and
denounce her. No; she was cunningly tricking
him ; he would as cleverly trap her. He would
go to the meeting.
His wife, whose handiwork both these letters
were, had reckoned that he would. The success
of her scheme for clearing herself depended on
that.
They had hardly shaken hands when he bore
down upon them. It was her brother —that good
old useful brother who serves so many purposes.
Relieved, but still suspicious, he said, “ What’s
this ? I thought you were going to stop at home
this afternoon ? Where are you taking my
Amy ? ”
“ Don’t be angry, Harry ; I thought you
wouldn’t mind very much,” she said, caressing his
arm. “ I know how you hate the theatre, so we
didn’t tell you, bub Tom and I have been taking
lessons in acting, and we’re going to have private
theatricals Thursday night.”
“My God ! what an evil-minded brute I am,”
he thought. A revulsion of love and pity for the
little woman he had wronged overcame him. His
wife watched his face closely. “ Come and look
at the shops, dear,” she said, and she worked his
repentance for a new blue dress.
The Other Man said he liked her best in blue.

The Fleets.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Black Finn lay in his bunk agasp—
Sore fretted his soul for flight ;
I owed thee a favor once,” said he,
Bend down till I give thee sight 1 ” . . .
He touched his eyes where the death-films spread,
then clammily touched lie mine—
“ Now, open the port-hole wide,” he cried, “and
repayment shall be thine ! ”
Ihe Night was crowned with a lakh of stars ; but
West, where the sun had died,
His blood burned red at the sea-line yet, and sor-
rowful mourned the tide.
This was the gift of the dying Finn :—A-covering
all the Seas,
I saw the ships of the Seas, in line, come over the
centuries:
I heard them bringing their anchors up in the
Harbors of Cockayne,
I heard them laying their anchors down at the
Blessed Isles again.
The corposants at their mast-heads glowed. Be-
times, as they passed me by,
I saw the stars through their sails afar, shine dim
in the lower sky !
The Ancient Sire in his fire-scooped bole, rowed
first through the falling dusk—
His flint axe-head by a tough thong tied, his spear
of the mammoth tusk :
And o’er the boom of the brooding waves, I heard
as he paddled on
The hungry growl of the Great Gave Bear, the
tramp of the Mastodon.
The echoes died in a voice of crowds as out from
the Tigris’ mouth
The bulrush boat of a*Bagd id sheik came rolling
her cargo South ;
Her strong palm wine in its earthen jars, her dates
on their lea ves laid,
To passion the lord of Babylon, and pleasure the
Hittite maid . . .
Soft fell the clink of a brazen bell, and under our
counter passed
A quaint-built craft of acanthus wood, on her twin
acanthus mast
A papyrus sail, all lotus-flowered ; recline in its
shade a girl
With deep, orbed eyes of the despot East, and a
mouth of rose and pearl. . . .
I heard the roll of the Prakrit speech, and a galley
tall rode on,
All clinker-built of a cedar trunk from the Mount
of Lebanon :
Her deep keel leaped to the mighty sweep of the
thrashing three-banked oars,
As she held away from the pirate hands that
itched by the Tuscan shores.
“But this,” I cried, “from the dockyards wide
of the blue Piraeus swung ;
These be the men who have wrought with stone
and written in Homer's tongue.”
I hailed them loud as their brave ship passed, and
the echoes answered me :
“ Oh sang the seas when the world was young, sweet
vjas the song of the sea ;
The days are dead and the days will die, but liveth
the Odyssey."
* * * *
The Black Finn muttered a Norland spell and
groaned like a dog in pain—
“l owed thee a favor twice,” said he, “look out
on the seas again ! ”
I looked, and lo ! from the Ten Lost Isles to the
Island of San Chen-San,
From Hy-Brasil to the Port of Lob, the host of
their numbers ran :
Tied in the link of a thousand years, the Celt, in
his skin canoe,
Rode prow and prow with a Kentish chief hard
pulled by a painted crew ;
And, linked again by a thousand years, a proa
with her sail aback
Rode neck and neck with the Hunting Man in his
walrus-hide kayak.
The long, beaked neck of a Punio: barge shot by
like a scared sea-snake,
Her lights ablaze on the brazen helms of the Latin
foe ; a-wake
Abiding not to his haughty hail they galloped
along the foam, —
“ The gods that ye know avail ye not 1 Give heed to
the gods of Rome l ”
Aye, now the Cub of the Wolf at Rome a-cleaving
the seas doth go,
To clear the road to the Westward Isles that her
traders’ keels may know
The weight of the British hides and wool and the
Western fish and game,
That garnish the proud patrician board of the
Proud Patrician Dame.
<■ » * *
The Black Finn moaned on his bed of Death.
“ Make haste ere I go,” he cried ;
“ Thrice have I a favor owed to thee ; now open
the porthole . . . wide !”....
From the silken South, the sinewed North, from
the shining East and West,
With their pale corpse-candles all alight and the
Four Winds all at rest,
They drifted in from the Bay of Sleep and the
Gulf of Acheron,
They drifted out from the Isle of Souls ; from the
Isles of Avalon ;
Theysteamed from the frozenDumslaf Land, away
in the frozen seas ;
From Fly-away-Cape, in Isle-au-Sein, and the
famed Hesperides.
The outer plain with their host was hid, and the
inner plain was filled
With ev’ry rig that the seas have known ; with
every make and build.
A mat-sailed junk of the China Coast and a white-
washed Arab dhow
They passed to port and to starboard on with the
liner build of now.
The narrow ships of the Oreekmen bold spread
their strong black raven wings,
With blue-sailed boats of the Irish bays and fleets
of the Saxon Kings,
A buoent uir, with her long red oars i.nd a high-
decked hull of Spain,
They rode with the tubs that traded wool for the
wine of A juitaine;
With B'ack Sea tubs of the Genoese, with the
cruisers of Algiers,
With slavers, pirates, and corsair-men in their
fighting privateers ;
With koff< which carried the Dutchman’s goods
langsyne to the Javanese ;
And Mogul's ships that were fain to yield to the
plundering Portuguese.
The fleets of the Nations gathered in ; the fleets of
the Nations grew,
But the fleet of the Little Islands spread till they
counted six to two.
Along the Downs and abreast the Sands, like a
great cloud came they forth,
And some went West to the S j as Unknown, and
some to the South and North.
Then heard I a Voice from over-seas, and the
Voice in thunders spake : . . .
“ The spoil of the world is his for aye who courage
shall find to take ;
The codfish spawns on the Banks for him ; the
bees of the Alp slopes toil,
The fruits of the fruiting Earth are his ; the corn,
the wine, and the oil ” !
A silence fell on the Nations all. Then a strong-
tongued voice up-spoke,
“ With grammars and guns we go, oh Lord ! with
the Heart of Steel and Oak ;
The plunder of Antwerp first we take. But, Lord,
ere our flags be furled,
We'll spoil the spoilers of all the earth and loot
the loot of the world.
“Our English blondes in the rajah’s silks shall
shine as they walk arrayed,
Our workmen’s hands they are deft to build, and
our hearts be unafraid ;
We’ve lack o’ sable for Whitehall folk, and port
for our noble dames,
And the weed that grows where Raleigh went —in
spite of our good King James !
“The Doge of Venice may bite his beard, and
counsel his lords profound,
The I urk hath greeted our Tudor Queen, and the
Susan's outward bound;
She s ta en a cargo of London truck, and her
skipper trusts in God,
The length o’ stroke and the strength of oak and
his great guns thirty-odd.” . . .
* • * *
I saw them spreading and spreading far, yea, over
the utmost seas
The black-hulled catts of the Steelyard firms, and
the Livery Companies,
The sailing-ships of the First Great Queen, the
steaming ships of the Last,
By the rogues of the realm all stoutly manned, and
the red flag at the mast.
The last to cross was a battle-ship of a clean ten
thousand tons,
A two-foot wall of twice-tempered steel and a
grinning tier of guns;
Her triple-expansion engines throbbed at touch of
her engineers,
She lit the seas with her bright arc-light and
blotted away the years.
She hulled them down on St. Brandan’s Road,
and I watched them one by one,
Till the last great liner thundered out, and the
last drab tramp was gone.
The stars lay still on the lonely seas, I turned to
the Finn, and said :
“Whither in truth have the good ships gone?
but the lean Black Finn was dead.
Sydney, 1899.

The American clergy of a prominent
Yankee town recently declared kilts to be inde-
cent. It was mentioned, by way of palliation,
that Queen Victoria’s servants (some of them)
walked about daily in aforesaid “ indecent garb.”
Hereupon, Rev. Frank Hoagland, a leading
Y.M.O.A. light: “Queen Victoria is doubtless
respectable, but she is very indiscreet.”
A Bulletin man : “ Heard an earnest
Salvarmy officer at it a few nights ago. He was
praying mightily for * the great invidel.’ Who ? I
wondered. Ingersoll,. Joe Symes—who ? Listened
for a name. Who had been scoffing now? Per-
haps the Bulle But he roared louder than
ever: ‘ Gawd bless’n. Restore’n to us. Thou
knawest what we shud do without the invidel—
Gawd bless’n —we dawn’t.’ And so on. By-and-
bye it transpired. He used ‘General ’ instead of
‘invidel.’ It was while the old man was sick.
He meant‘invalid.’”
The Australasian Medical Gazette per-
tinently but awkwardly asks what there is in the
way of contribution to general medical knowledge
to show for the .£BO,OOO spent during the last 20
years on Sydney University Medical School, and
points out that the only practical result erf the
“labors” of the elaborate professional staff has
been the swamping of the medical profession
with callow practitioners, who, as being pre-
ferred for resident hospital positions, have
to “ gain experience upon Sydney maimed
poor.” When you come to think of it,
Premier Kingston’s Napoleonic solution of the
Adelaide Hospital trouble was a great democratic
and humanitarian move. It is beginning to slowly
dawn upon the public that every big hospital
should always have on the premises, night and
day, two or three high-class medicoes of wide ex-
perience, men who could command extensive prac-
tice and high fees as consultants outside—instead
of relying almost exclusively on the casual and
often perfunctory visits of overworked “ hono-
raries ” and the services of boys just' out of the
medical schools.

Mrs. L. Kennington, of Station St., Petersham, New South Wales, sends us
the above portrait of herself, with the following letter : , „
“ I have used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and have found it a wonderful strengt
ing and invigorating tonic and restorative. _ . , ~ , .
“Some time ago I caught a severe cold and an attack of rheumatism o -
lowed. I suffered terrible pains, could not eat or sleep, and feared I mig t e-
come a helpless invalid. . ,
“ I did not obtain any relief until I was given a prescription tor {sarsa-
parilla.’ My husband took it to a chemist, who said, ‘Try Ayer’s.
“ I noticed a decided improvement from the very first, and I was soon ab e
to do my work again. I know of several people who owe their good health to
this great medicine.”
These remarkable results are not due alone to the sarsaparilla in Ayer s
Sarsaparilla. They are due to the combined action of many ingredients. No
other sarsaparilla contains the same medicines.. There is no other sarsaparilla
like “ Ayer’s.” This is why the people call it
“Th® World’s Oreatest Family Medicine.”
“ Ayer’s ” cures. You know this. You have to experiment with others,
and you can’t afford to do that. . ,
