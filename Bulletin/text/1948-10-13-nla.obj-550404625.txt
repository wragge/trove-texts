HTHE quaint and busy market town of
Ashby de la Zouch, in Leicestershire,
possesses the picturesque ruins of a castle
which dates mainly from 1474, but these
ruins incorporate some scanty remains of
an earlier castle or manor which was
granted to Hugh de Grantmesnil by Wil-
liam the Conqueror (1066-1087). About
1160 it passed to Alan de la Zouch, a
Breton, who married the heiress to the
manor, and it remained in that family’s
possession until the end of the fourteenth
century. In 1461, after the battle of
Towton, Edward IV seized the castle and
granted it to Sir William. Hastings in
1464.
Hastings fortified the castle and built
the keep, shown here, which is its most
prominent feature. Sir William (after-
wards Lord) Hastings was a strong
Yorkist during the Wars of the Roses.
He became a great favourite of Edward
IV, and was made Chamberlain of the
Royal Household and Master of the
Mint. In 1471 he became Lieutenant of
Calais. At the death of his royal patron
he was denounced as a traitor by the new
king, Richard 111, and was held in the
Tower of London. In June, 1484, he was
summarily executed.
The hall, kitchen tower, chapel and
other buildings of Ashby de la Zouch
Castle date mainly from the 14th cen-,
tury, but some Norman masonry is in-
corporated in the hall. A particularly
fine decorated fireplace can be seen in
the castle keep.
On two occasions, once in 1569 and
again in 1586, Mary Queen of Scots
spent a night in this castle, and both
James I (1603-1625) and Charles I (1625-
1649) stayed here. During the Civil War
the castle was held for the King and sus-
tained a long siege, but surrendered after
the Battle of Naseby, in 1645, when
Charles I and Prince Rupert were de-
cisively beaten by Fairfax. Ashby de la
Zouch castle was then partially destroyed
by the Parliamentary forces. Today it is
famous as being the locale of several
scenes in “Ivanhoe,” in which Sir Walter
Scott weaved much romance into the
castle ruins. Castle Ashby de la Zouch
is the subject of a once popular song.

MORE ON CENSORSHIP.
[These comments on the plan put for-
ward by the Red Page as a remedy for
the intolerable position in which Aus-
tralian writers have been placed by recent
prosecutions are continued from B.
t>/10/’4B and B. 29/9/’4B.j
From Kylie Tennant : —
A little commonsense is all that is
needed to sweep away our present absurd
censorship-by-Customs-clerk, but the lack
of that commonsense will leave the job to
him indefinitely however many excellent
plans you may put forward. The Customs-
house men are as near average citizens
as you could ask. They hurry across to
Sargent’s and eat pies in the lunch-hour
at tremendous speed so they can rush
back—not to censor books—but to hold
down a job and fetd their wife and kids.
They read almost as little of a book as a
professional book critic, who—if he is not
too drunk or too tired —reads the first,
middle and last chapter as well as the
publisher’s blurb. Most of them only
read the publisher’s blurb. When a pro-
fessional critic, paid for judging a book,
reads so little of it, can you blame a man
who has to sandwich the job between
decrees on imported silk, hams and
machine-oil?
You would replace this Customs
clerk, vaguely hostile to all forms
of literature except the whodunnits
and dream-lover fiction he borrows
for his wife, by a broadminded
savant and —here is the horrible part—
the more that savant knows of literature
the less he is likely to censor, because that
is the way with literary men. You would
replace censorship by the representative
of an ignorant majority by censorship by
an intelligent minority which would
finally dwindle to hardly any censorship
at all. Is that democracy? Is that the
way things are done in this fair country?
Tush! As one who rejoices in smut for
its own sake I shall refuse to entertain
such a proposition. Any form of censor-
ship beggars serious discussion —an insult
to the intelligent and an absurdity only
possible because literacy is compulsory.
Imagine compelling people to learn to
read and then protecting them from the
results of that compulsion! For Heaven’s
sake!
From Gavin Casey : —-
All book censorship seems silly to me,
for of all available means of gaining
knowledge or amusement the book is the
one which can be digested most
thoroughly and at leisure, and through
which it is hardest to put over excessive
emotional appeal. However, if somebody
has to ban books it had much better be
men who know something about them, as
suggested.
One of the big questions would be
whether or not self-appointed moral re-
formers who had been startled out of their
wits by the revelation in a clear white
light of what they prefer to regard
through many layers of murk would take
any notice of an advisory body. But it
would certainly be worth trying.
From Frank Dalby Davison : —
Nobody is competent to decide what
the people of a country shall read except
the people themselves. Freedom of access
to the library shelves is a prime right of
citizenship, and necessary to individual
and national development. All arguments
to the contrary eventually provide creep-
ing cover for acts designed to stunt the
growth of humanity—usually by excuse,
and at a gain, forsooth, of preventing the
circulation of a little dull pornography!
In thinking that censorship of literature
and of art in all its forms should be
abolished I have in mind especially the
rights, needs and eventual duties of that
young person about whom those who
support censorship appear to hold such a
very unfavorable opinion.
From Brian James :
Literary censorship is wrong in prin-
ciple, illogical and inconsistent in its in-
cidence. and it often shows itself absurd
or comic.
Wrong in principle: for it negatives
the free development of man’s person-
ality. In censorship is a rank assumption
of power. Such power, in the main,
blights and stultifies and sets a limit to
man’s progress. Surely it is not the exer-
cise of power, which can be, and often is,
stupid, blind and crude, that has made
for man’s development—rather it is his
defiance of it, his successful resistance to it.
Illogical and inconsistent in incidence:
I can read (legally) “Measure for
Measure,” or Ben Jonson and Chaucer at
their very frankest; I am even allowed
to read certain choice and human stories
in the Old Testament . . . All these and
many more without apparent risk of
d&mnation (of the official brand). But
where the cold and superior mind has
frowned on more recent writing I must
be saved—from my own baser instincts.
Absurd and comic: While sympathy
is with Mr. Close and Mr. Glassop in
their punishments by Court action, one
can’t help laughing at the comical nature
of the proceedings. The whole world
must have laughed at the spectacle of a
'handcuffed writer (leg-irons omitted by
some curious oversight) going to jail; and
laughed at an Australia that could pro-
vide—in the 20th century—such a spec-
tacle. Perhaps no other civilised country
could put on such a show. But wasn’t it
in Australia that a shire-councillor most
solemnly proposed that a peculiar rock-
formation should be blown up by gelig-
nite? The rock had a remote resemblance
to a nude woman! Perhaps, then, Mr.
Close and Mr. Glassop got off very lightly
indeed. At least they were not blown up
with gelignite.
Is censorship necessary? No. Would
we be any the worse for its complete
abandonment? No.
From R. G. Howarth :
I do not favor censorship of literature
whether native or imported, but since it
exists and the Commonwealth Literature
Censorship Board, with the Appeal
Censor, theoretically removes the moral
judgment of imported works from the
court of the Customs clerks, and I have
confidence in the personnel of the board,
I believe that it could well extend its
operations to the State spheres. There
seems to be no reason, however, why
the decisions should not be made public,
as are those of the Film Censorship
Board. It, has been suggested that books
be graded like films for adult or juvenile
enjoyment, and this seems a good plan.
The only risk is that unsuspecting readers
may find themselves disagreeing with a
conventional mark of A for .Saroyan (as
dramatist) and J for The Wind in the
Willows ! Finnegans Wake and Of Time
and the River might need a special clas-
sification such as OA (like OS).
Though we are fortunate in the present
censors, their office raises the question of
the qualification of the appointors. Who
is to select the selectors? Does popular
vote suffice? Are politicians fit to judge
literary judgment? Then, should not
some rules be laid down for the guidance
of the Censorship Board, such as that
“bloody” is admissible but “ ” is not,
and that the hiatus* into which the novelist
customarily plunges us after lovers’ meet-
ings is a damnable device? Perhaps the
only solution is to seek opinions widely,
as The Bulletin is doing on this
occasion, and draw from them reasonable
conclusions. This was effected notably
by the Tariff Board in a recent inquiry
into a demand for restriction on the entry
of ail oversea publications into Australia.
Rupert Bunny's Paintings
The fault in Rupert Bunny (R.P.
8/9/’4B) was that he never found out for
himself enough from nature at first-
hand. That was why he stayed on for
so long in France, where, for his pur-
poses, the supply of ready-made examples
was unlimited.
His first paintings to come back here
from France show him to have been
immediately captured by the game of
seeing through the eyes of painters
already notable. First-hand nature bored
him. He was interested only in what
Laurens, Degas, Puvis and other arrives
made of it (and his work shows it);
which, in its way, was well enough but not
of much use in developing one’s self —
which, by studying nature, his exemplars
had done.
When Bunny first reached Paris Jules
Bastien-Lepage had not long been dead
—young and famous —and his influence,
reasonably enough, at once exerted itself
on Bunny in so far at least as temporarily
to grey his palette. This was his initial
step in the fascinating occupation of see-
ing nature through pictures. In Paris it
was the order of the day and that was
good enough for Bunny as it was good
enough for thousands of art students.
It served him throughout his painting
career in France, but failed him outside
that country. When Bunny came back
to Australia he could find no good ready-
made patterns worked out by others to
follow. The “machine” which had served
him for 40 years (from 20 to 60) was un-
suitable for his foreign native land and
he had no developed observation to use
on what should have interested and in-
spired him.
He painted the Upper Murray badly.
He had no recipes for it, no examples to
work on. He cut his artistic losses and
did not persist.
Mr. Clive Turnbull, who wrote the
foreword to The Art of Rupert Bunny,
resents Australia’s neglect of Bunny. To
me it always seems strange that he sold
his alien work here as well as he did.
As to the murals on the walls of Federal
buildings that he should have been com-
missioned to do: which buildings did Mr.
Turnbull have in mind? Or were the
paintings to be done on vast rolls of
canvas and stored until edifices fit for
them were erected?
Bunny missed originality, and all the
beautiful books will not make him sur-
vive. He missed survival for the reasons
well put by your writer when he says:
“When an Australian goes off to Europe
to paint he may lose more than his native
gum-trees ; he may lose his individuality.
Bunny worked, Mr. Turnbull rightly says,
directly in the great tradition; yes, and
perhaps he lost himself in it.”
Art is not universal. No one but a
Chinese can produce Chinese art, no
German can produce French art and
neither was Bunny’s art ever quite French.
It is nationality which produces and
chiefly appreciates each nation’s art.
When his French world was on the wane
Bunny came back to a scene which he
held in such little esteem that for the
remainder of his days he preferred to
make pictures out of his head in what
he could remember of his composite
Parisian idiom.'
In some strange way Mr. Turnbull’s
view of the neglect of Bunny seized the
minds of the board of trustees of the
National Gallery of Victoria. They ex-
hibited a collection of a great many of
his works, and at one clip bought six of
his paintings, two that were done long
ago in France and four recent and not
goocj ones of Greek mythological sub-
jects looking, as The Bulletin writer
aptly says, “like decor for ballet.”
The citations in the Bunny book of
honors won in France would probably
be disallowed by both Mr. Turnbull and
Mr. Buesst if adduced by anyone in
behalf of, say, William Dargie, who in
open field has won the Archibald Prize
five times, yet has not had one single
work of his bought by the very board
which not only acquired at a stroke six
Bunnys but has bought the work of
a number of Dargie’s present pupils.
Long ago in France Governmental
recognition became a matter for cynical
comment, and newspaper notices were
looked on as bad jokes. In any of the
arts it was said that from any of the art-
reporters high praise was to be had for
the price of a dinner. Bunny himself
used to tell a story of a transfer made in
the Luxembourg Museum at the instance
of a wealthy American—and friend of
Bunny’s—who owned a picture by a
notorious (fashionable) painter which he
liked less than the one in the gallery by
the same man. That arranged itself, and
soon it was officially announced that an
exchange very advantageous to the
museum had been made. The Luxem-
bourg picture went to Hartford.
Not that anyone who knew Bunny
would dream that he was anything but
honest. The fact remains that the gener-
ality of official transactions in France
were of no value as evidence of worth
or merit.
J. S. MACDONALD.
Crusoe in Queensland.
Students of theology will find an un-
expected interest in the extraordinarily
handsome edition of Robinson Crusoe
published by Jackson and O’Sullivan,
Pty., Ltd., Brisbane, for it appears that
the devil has fallen on such evil times
that he is no longer worth mentioning.
In the original novel, just after that
magical moment when Crusoe has been
“exceedingly surprised with the print of
a man’s naked foot on the shore, which
was very plain to be seen in the sand,”
the castaway surmises:
Sometimes I fancied it must be the devil;
and reason joined me in this supposition.
For how should any other thing in human
shape come into the place? Where was the
vessel that brought them? What marks
were there of any other footsteps? And
how was it possible a man should come
there? But then to think that Satan should
take human shape upon him in such a
place, where there could be no manner of
occasion for it but to leave the print of his
foot behind him, and that even for no pur-
pose, too, for he could not be sure I should
see it; this was an amusement the other
way. I considered that the devil might have
found out abundance of other ways to
have terrified me, than this of the single
print of a foot; that, as I lived quite on
the other side of the island, he would never
have been so simple to leave a mark in a
place where it was ten thousand to one
whether I should ever see it or not; and in
the sand, too, which the first surge of the
sea upon a high wind would have defaced
entirely. All this seemed inconsistent with
the thing itself, and with all the notions
we usually entertain of the subtilty of the
devil.
Messrs. Jackson and O’Sullivan doubt-
less mean no disrespect to the fiend—nor
to Defoe—by omitting this passage (with
many others); but one should beware,
all the same, of offending the old gentle-
man.
The effect of the cuts is to reduce the
appeal of the edition to readers who value
Defoe for his complete and marvellous
verisimilitude of detail and who want
their Robinson Crusoe untampered with,
as a classic of English prose; but, very
likely, for Defoe did take his time about
it, it is all the better as a book for boys.
It has long been the custom to print a
simplified version for children, and this
edition, though it has features which will
appeal to adult collectors and is pub-
fished at a high price, seems even in
William Bustard’s gorgeous illustrations
to have been designed primarily for the
young.
The word “gorgeous” is used ad-
visedly: It means, according to Webster,
“arrayed in splendid or vivid colors,
showy, resplendently beautiful, magnifi-
cent,” and any ,of those terms would fit
the 10 color-plates in this enormous
book. William Bustard, a Queensland
artist of distinction, >has, in effect, shifted
Crusoe’s desert island across a few
thousand miles of sea to somewhere in
the vicinity of the Barrier Reef. The up-
heaval seems justifiable enough from the
literary point of view, for one tropic
island may be presumed to be reasonably
like another; and from the artistic view-
point the results —remembering that Mr.
Bustard has painted color and drama for
boys rather than character for adults —
are triumphant. The book blazes with
blue water on dazzling white beaches,
with gilded ships, with many-colored
parrots on palm-trees brilliant in the
sunlight.
The incidents for illustration have
been well-selected from the novel’s big
scenes of drama, and, in addition to the
color-plates, there are many line-draw-
ings let into the text. The book is printed
in double columns, a style that can be
monstrous when small type is crammed
on to a small page, but which in this
case, because large type is used on a large
page, is perfectly readable ; more read-
able, indeed, than a long single line of
type would have been, stretching across
the wide page. The publishers have been
able to pack in a good proportion of
the original novel without making a book
so thick that the color-plates would be
lost in it.
The book is published in two editions:
an ordinary edition (in which the color-
plates are included) at two guineas and a
de luxe edition, limited to 175 copies,
more handsomely bound than the other,
at five guineas. It is an experiment in
Australian publishing, but not, when one
has seen William Bustard’s illustrations,
so risky as it might otherwise seem ; and
certainly an experiment which deserves to
succeed, for it is a sign of advancing cul-
ture when Australian artists, following
Norman Lindsay’s lead with the
Petronius and the Shepherd Press Great
Expectations, claim the right to interpret
the world’s classics as well as our own.
Anybody who has a nephew—and two or
five guineas—would do well to keep this
Robinson Crusoe in mind round about
Christmas.

Highest recorded temperatures at
Death Valley, California ( U.S.A. ),
within recent years. Longest run of
very high temperatures at the same
place ?
During the hot season, which runs
from May to September, from June,
1935, to the end of September, 1947,
the highest recorded temperature was
126deg. in July, 1942, and July, 1947.
In August, 1936, July and August,
1937, and July, 1945, maximum tem-
peratures of 125deg. were reached.
The longest sustained period of ab-
normal high temperatures was 122
days from June 1 to September 28,
1935, inclusive.

When did the Sixth Queensland
Imperial Bushmen leave Australia for
the Boer War? By what transport
did the contingent travel and where
and when did it disembark in South
Africa?
The contingent embarked at Bris-
bane on April 4, 1901, in S.S. Vic-
toria, arrived at Cap© Town on May
2, 1901, and left the same day for
Durban, disembarking there on May
7. Two drafts followed, one on S.S.
Britannica on August 18, 1901, and
one on Harlech Castle on September
26. Both drafts came to Sydney by
rail and embarked at Sydney for
Cape Town, arriving there on Sep-
tember 22 and October 26, 1901.

Why are the tubes of a Babcock
and Wilcox boiler set at an angle of
45 deg. ?
They are set at an angle of 15deg.
to the horizontal, not 45deg. as men-
tioned. This angle was adopted as
a result of experiments carried out by
George H. Babcock. It is desirable
to have the tubes set as nearly as
possible at right angles to the path
of the gases passing over them to
obtain maximum heat transfer; this
would indicate a horizontal tube
arrangement. It is also necessary,
however, to have a difference in level
between the two ends of the tubes
in order to permit of the, circulation
of the water and steam. The 15deg.
setting gives an acceptable compro-
mise between these two factors.

What is the value of lime to soil
and best time to apply it ?
The chief merit of lime is that it
sweetens the ground and releases
potash in heavy clay. It is also essen-
tial to heavily-manured plots for
growing strong-rooted crops, particu-
larly brassicas, which carry club-root
disease unless lime is used. Plots
should be allowed to fallow for at
least three weeks after the lime has
been used, longer where possible. For
rich soils use quicklime; light and
sandy loam is best treated with agri-
cultural limestone or slaked lime.
Lime is most helpful when applied
in the autumn, but light dressings can
be applied throughout the year.
Quantities to use depend on whether
land has been treated previously; 6oz.
quicklime or lOoz. slaked lime per
square yard is generally sufficient.

World distribution and availability
of radioactive ores?
World occurrences of radioactive
ores are described in a forthcoming
pamphlet (“Radioactive Mineral De-
posits”) to be issued by the Mineral
Resources Bureau, Department of
Supply and Development, 485 Bourke-
street, Melbourne. Briefly, radio-
active uranium-bearing deposits are
known in Belgian Congo, Canada,
Czechoslovakia, England, Australia,
Bulgaria, Portugal, U.S.A., Madagas-
car and Sweden. Deposits contain-
ing radioactive thorium minerals
occur in India, Australia, Brazil and
Florida.
Brief Answers.
J.D.: Land is always surveyed on
a horizontal-plane basis. In con-
sequence an area of one acre on
perfectly level land would not have
as great an area of surface soil as
an acre on undulating or sloping land.
T.H.C.: There are a number of
hardwoods immune to lyctus attack,
notably blackbutt, brush-box, several
of the stringybarks, and grey iron-
bark. Of the common hardwoods,
those most commonly found attacked
(in the sapwood only) are spotted-
gum, messmate stringybark (often sold
as Tasmanian oak) and tallowwood.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
U.S. SPY REPORT.
As well as recommending (as
cabled) that a number of per-
sons should be prosecuted on
charges involving, among other
things, atom-bomb secrets, the
U.S. Congress committee in-
vestigating Communist activity
published an interim report on
“what is being uncovered” in its
hearings of evidence on “the
espionage conspiracy which the
Communists have established
and operated in U.S. Executive
agencies.”
Since, as it states, “every day
brings in new facts” which have
to be investigated, the com-
mittee’s final report may not be
published for some time yet, but
meanwhile here are some of its
findings so far:
“It is now definitely estab-
lished that during the late war
and since then there have been
numerous Communist espionage
rings at work in our [U.S.]
Executive .agencies which have
worked with and through the
American Communist party
and its agents to relay to Russia
vital information essential to our
national defence and security.
Russian Communists have
worked hand in hand with
American Communists in these
espionage activities.”
♦ ♦ * ♦
“It is established beyond
doubt that there is grave need for
vigorous, persistent and cour-
ageous continued investigation
to determine the identity of those
guilty of ’past offences, the
methods employed in the past
and at present to move carefully
selected Communist agents and
their sympathisers into key posi-
tions of government, and to
break up all Communist espion-
age conspiracies and activities
prevailing at this t»* r *e.”
* * * *
“Investigations and hearings
thus far completed offer con-
vincing and compelling reasons
why new legislation is necessary
to safeguard this free republic
against the new and clever con-
spiratorial tactics developed by
Communists to promote and
conceal their espionage activities
and their disloyal purposes.”
*** * *
“Communists must be required
by law to register so that the
present underground activities of
the party will be subject to at
least this additional weapon of
exposure and detection.”
* * * *
“Communists should be
denied by law the privilege of
employment by the Federal Gov-
ernment, with adequate penalties
on both those seeking employ-
ment as Communists and those
knowingly giving appointive
positions to Communists.”
* * * ♦
“Passports should be denied
American Communists who
utilise these passports to further
their conspiratorial plots against
American freedoms as they
confer with their co-conspirators
abroad.”
* * * *
“Legislation should be adopted
making it more difficult for un-
limited numbers of foreign Com-
munists to enter the United
States and making it easier for
this Government to deport or
imprison Communist emissaries
who utilise their entrance into
the United States to attack or
undermine American institu-
tions.”
* * * *
“The espionage laws of the
U.S. should be amended or
tightened so as to provide ap-
propriate penalties for Govern-
ment officials who, without
authority, relay secret and sig-
nificant information affecting
national security to the represen-
tatives of any foreign Power,
friend or enemy, peace-time or
war,”
* * * *
“During the course of these
hearings, our committee was
shocked to have before it wit-
nesses who hold reserve commis-
sions in our armed forces and
who refused to answer under
oath whether or not they were,
are, or ever have been members
of the Communist party. It was
equally shocking to have former
high officials of the Federal Gov-
ernment take such a position,
The committee therefore recom-
mends that the armed services re-
voke the commission of any
officer who refuses to answer this
question. The Communist party
is now accepted in all quarters
as not being a political party in
fact but a conspiracy working
for the overthrow of the Govern-
ment of the United States. The
committee further recommends
that any official or employee of
the Government who will refuse
to state under oath whether or
not he is a member of the Com-
munist party should be removed,
and his name ‘flagged’ against
an y future Government service.”
Moscow Misled.
“Those who know Russia
best,” a Washington correspon-
dent of N. Y. “World-Telegram”
comments, “are convinced that
the present danger of war arises
largely from the Kremlin’s
abysmal ignorance of what goes
on outside the Iron Curtain. In-
dications are that Stalin and
those about him actually believe
the United States is bent on
world domination. They could
not believe that if they were
getting the truth from their
agents abroad.”
Adding that “apparently no
effort is made to learn the truth,”
the writer gives as an instance
Molotov, “who makes a point
of wearing blinders” while he’s
abroad: “In San Francisco at
the birth of the United Nations,
he had a special elevator set
aside for him in his hotel so he
would not have to rub elbows
with ordinary people. In New
York, he moved about sur-
rounded by a bodyguard.”
Washington “Post,” on the
same danger, points out that
“The Russians’ information on
what is happening in the outside
world is colored by the fact that
they are victims of their own
propaganda that the capitalist
order is bound to collapse. No
emissary, indeed, would dare to
report events on any other basis ;
it would be as much as his life
was worth if he did.”
Such distortions of what is
going on “are bound to put a
premium on mistakes in Soviet
policy,” and regarding Berlin
Soviet policy has been com-
pletely out of focus; “The Rus-
sians did not foresee either the
Western determination to stay in
Berlin or the German support of
the Western position. They
have stubbed their toes badly in
their attempt to dragoon Ger-
man opinion. Pieck, the leading
Communist in Germany, is re-
ported to have said that three
weeks of the blockade had un-
done three years of Communist
spadework in Germany.” Un-
fortunately (and it could be
dangerously), “there appears to
be no way of disabusing the
Soviet mind of the fixed ideas
with which it is cluttered.”
Similarly a Washington cor-
respondent of “Christian Science
Monitor” quotes U.S. diplomatic
authorities as agreeing that
“Moscow believes and trusts
those agents who report what
Moscow most wants to hear.”
Those who send in “objective
and sometimes discouraging”
reports are suspected of being
contaminated by their capi-
talistic environment. Moscow
is acting as it is because, of
“diplomatically encouraged mis-
conceptions” of American
policy.
Hitler was like that, too.
Jap “Revolution.”
What General MacArthur is
attempting in Japan is, of course,
nothing less than the enforce-
ment of a peaceful “revolution”
in Jap national and political life
and outlook. By some reports
the success or failure of that am-
bitious attempt is still very
much in the balance.
A Tokyo correspondent of
N. Y. “Herald Tribune” states
that the situation there now “is
loaded with dynamite.” Ex-
tremists of both Right and Left,
he has reported “are begin-
ning to organise their murderous
gangs, just as the ‘Steel Helmets’
and the ‘Red Front’ were or-
ganised in Germany in the social
chaos which brought Hitler to
power.”
MacArthur is seen as act-
ing “with one basic responsi-
bility to his own people” —that
is, “to deny command over the
Japanese to the Communist In-
ternational, directed from Mos-
cow, which is trying to obtain
it by the usual tactics of fifth-
column warfare based on the
Red ideology.” That job, the
correspondent states, is “just be-
ginning to be a battle and no
mere garden party” ; he points
out that “of 6,000,000 unionised
workers in a country where
labor unions were long overdue,
one-half are under control of
Communist leaders.” Mac-
Arthur has three times already
blocked attempts to start revo-
lutionary strikes.
An important factor in the
MacArthur “democratising” is
Jap recovery, but this is linked
to Asiatic recovery as a whole,
and that is something beyond
the control of anyone in Tokyo.
As well as the fighting in China,
Malaya and elsewhere prevent-
ing Asiatic, and hence Jap, re-
covery, the writer mentions
other slowing influences — e.g.,
“Other countries, such as Aus-
tralia and the Philippines, are
still so anti-Japanese that they
will proceed reluctantly with
commerce, though it will come
inevitably.”
The living standard of the
Jap masses is described as
today 30 per cent, lower than it
was in the 1930’5: “They feel
they are in a bad way, and a
host of well-trained Communist
agitators are exploiting their
grievances under protection of
liberties which General Mac-
Arthur has given the people.”
The U.S., meantime, is putting
$750,000,000-a-year into making
up the Jap food deficit and
stimulating trade, but the corre-
spondent declares there is some
question in Tokyo whether that
huge contribution “will be
enough to tide Japan over its
dangerous social crisis.”
Further light on the progress
of the MacArthur peaceful
“revolution” is offered in
another N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
article, written by Shin-ichiro
Kudo, editor of the Tokyo daily
“Mainichi.” This Jap writer
sees the younger generation of
his countrymen as having been
brought up to accept totali-
tarianism ; hence “with the col-
lapse of Right-wing totalitarian-
ism today, it is most natural
that this younger generation is
showing inclination to jump over
to Left-wing totalitarianism.”
Referring to the reactions of
the younger Jap generation in a
revolution-strike attempt, the
same Jap writer gives this arrest-
ingly revealing picture: “They
sang ‘The Internationale’ in
place of ‘Kimigayo,’ waved the
Red banner instead of the Ris-
ing Sun and idolised Lenin and
Stalin instead of Tenno. In-
stead of obeying the orders of
their commanding officer as in
the war, they now were faithful
to the dictates of their union’s
executive - committee chief.
Under their ‘unity of steel’ they
were, and still are, willing to
‘brave death.’ There is no differ-
ence between their being Tokko-
tai’s suicidal pilots during the
war and their reckless sacrifices
for the sake of their class
struggle.”
The Communist leaders are,
naturally, exploiting that un-
changed Jap nationalism. The
Jap writer reports the Corns as
using such slogans as “protec-
tion of racial integrity,” “pre-
servation of national independ-
ence” and “opposition against
being reduced to America’s
colony.” Their tactics are to
antagonise the Jap people against
the occupational army ; and, the
writer significantly adds, “To
those members of the younger
generation, reared in the atmos-
phere of militarism and totali-
tarianism, the arguments of the
Communists are becoming in-
creasingly attractive.”
In the MacArthur attempt to
democratise Japan the Jap writer
sees little danger from the Right,
which, he holds, is “bound to
get weaker and weaker.” On
the other hand, “the danger
from the Left cannot be ignored,
because it is manifesting a ten-
dency to become stronger and
stronger.” How to eliminate this
hazard is, he believes, “the
deepest and gravest problem
confronting Japan today.”
Fear of Germany.
International Labor Office
Director Sir Harold Butler is at
least one competent observer
who doesn’t subscribe to the
notion of a Soviet-German
partnership, with Moscow
dominant.
In a “Foreign Affairs” article,
however, he sees genuine fears
of a fully-recovered Germany
strongly held with reason
enough—in adjoining countries.
Meanwhile those fears he holds
to be serving the Moscow pur-
pose of keeping the scared
satellites at heel:
“Czechoslovakia, so long per-
meated with Western ideas, is
not likely to abandon her liber-
ties for ever. In Poland, Hungary
and Rumania there is little
natural love for Russia or for
the totalitarian way of life. The
underground revolt against
Communist dictatorship has be-
gun, nurtured not only by the
dispossessed middle classes but
also by the Socialists.
“But these nations are at pre-
sent tied to the Russian chariot
by two powerful bonds —the
fear of* their old regimes and
the fear of Germany. They want
to be freed from Communist
dictatorship, but they do not
wish to see their industries de-
nationalised or the land restored
to the great landowners. They
want to recover their national
independence, but they all fear a
German resurrection, particu-
larly the Poles and the Czechs,
who have expelled millions of
Germans and seized their
property.
“The German problem is the
great obstacle not only to the
unity of Western Europe but still
more to the unity of Europe as
a whole. The German people
will never remain content to be
split in two. As time goes on
the cry for a united Germany
will grow steadily louder. In
proportion as Western Germany
begins to enjoy self-government
and more tolerable conditions of
living, so will its attraction for
the dwellers in the Russian zone
increase. The aim of the latter
will not be to draw their Wes-
tern brethren under the Slav
yoke but to join with them in
throwing it off.
“And what then? Would a
united Germany resign herself
permanently to the loss of
Pomerania, East Prussia and
Silesia, which have made so
much of German history? If
ever the day comes when the re-
uniting of all Europe becomes
practical politics, that will be
the greatest stumbling-block.”
Fear of Germany must also
be included among the influences
shaping Soviet policy. As an in-
teresting sidelight on this, Dr.
Eduard Taborsky, who was sec-
retary to Benes throughout the
war and who has fled Czecho-
slovakia, has been reported by
C. L. Sulzberger in N. Y.
“Times” as giving the following
account of a discussion in Mos-
cow in 1943: “At the beginning
of this long discussion about
Poland, Mr. Stalin was very
sceptical. When the President
[Benes] assured him that the
Poles would see reason after this
war, Mr. Stalin remarked
‘Yes, but that will be after the
third war.’ The President
[Benes] immediately stated that
he did not believe there would
be a third world war, and when
Marshal Voroshilov too began
to doubt the prospect for future
peace Premier Stalin interrupted
again with the remark: ‘You
will not change the Germans in
a short time. There will be
another war with them.’ ”
Dragnet Digest.
Years of It Yet— All through the
recent wrangling “U.S. News and
World Report” has, in the American
term, stayed out on a limb, predicting
in every issue that there would be
no war. It is still on that limb in
latest air-mail copies, but it sees no
sign of peace, either; “You might as
well,” it says, “get used to the idea
of years of hostility between U.S. and
Russia, years of unresolved conflicts.
Solutions, when they come at all, are
to come piecemeal. It’s uncomfortable,
hard on nerves, but that’s the out-
look.”

Air-lift Effect. —One of a group of
15 German editors visiting the U.S.
under the Rockefeller Foundation and
Eisenhower sponsorship has given a
special reason why the Berlin air-lift
has been far from a complete loss.
Before it had to be launched the
Germans had considerable doubts
about U.S. intentions. Now, “The
German people are deeply impressed
by the air-lift. The man in the street
reads stories about it with great
enthusiasm because he knows that
America will fight now to defend free-
dom. Until a few months ago he
wasn’t sure.”
* * * *
Obstinate and Irresponsible. —Such
transparent propaganda shifts as
Vyshinsky’s proposal for a one-third
cut in all countries’ armaments —the
rest, of course, taking the “gentle-
man’s word” of Moscow that Russian
cuts had been made! —come under
the accurate diagnosis by N.Y.
“Times” of what makes Soviet policy
almost impossible to deal with: that
it is both obstinate and irresponsible.
“In the United Nations, in Berlin, at
every point of contact and in every
negotiation with the Western Powers,
the Soviet Government acts as if its
one aim is to prevent a solution of
any question in dispute.” Disarma-
ment is one of the very things the
Kremlin has blocked.

D.P. Corns. —Chicago “Tribune’s”
Ottawa correspondent has reported
that the Canadian Government has
been informed that every shipload of
displaced persons brought to Canada
in the last two years has included a
quota of Communists. One result is
that Minister of Labor Mitchell is
making an unpublicised trip to dis-
placed-persons camps in Germany in
an attempt to tighten Canada’s screen-
ing system. Official sources in Ottawa
are quoted as predicting that
Mitchell’s trip will result in a sharp
reduction in the number of displaced
persons admitted to Canada.

Communism’s Two Faces. —As de-
scribed by William Henry Chamber-
lin, a world-authority on the species:
“To a remarkable extent Communism
has succeeded in maintaining two
faces. To the people who live under
it in the Soviet Union and in the
satellite States it is a hard task-
master, a merciless engine of tyranny,
enforcing obedience by übiquitous
secret police, firing-squads and justly-
dreaded concentration camps. At the
same time it appeals to discontented
individuals in Western countries, who
know nothing of it from personal ex-
perience, as a new gospel of idealism
and social justice. It recruits many
of its fifth-column agents from people
who range in personality from un-
balanced reformers to frustrated and
sometimes malignant crackpots.”
*s■ $ *
Zhdanov’s Successor. N. Y.
“Times’s” chief European correspon-
dent has named as successor to
Zhdanov in “the private hierarchy
of the Kremlin” Deputy-Premier
Georgi M. Malenkov, stating that
“this stocky young party boss had
already been quietly edging ahead of
Zhdanov even before the latter’s fatal
illness.” The correspondent adds:
“In any analysis of lines of succession
in the Bolshevist authority it is gener-
ally accepted that Molotov would be
selected to assume Stalin’s titular
authority when the latter died. How-
ever, behind-the-scenes manoeuvring
for actual control of the Bolshevist
party would be of vital world impor-
tance. In this connection Malenkov’s
star is believed to be rising.”
* * ♦ ♦
U.N.O. Scepticism. London
“Times” editorially (leaning perhaps
towards understatement): “The failure
of the League of Nations and the
disappointments which have marked
the first years of U.N.O. have left
many people in Britain with a lively
if unconfessed scepticism of the value
of international organisations.” Of
U.N.O.’s educational offshoot
(U.N.E.5.C.0.), whose original pro-
jects included “the invention of a
new philosophy suitable for all and a
plan for discovering the emotional
tensions which produce war,” the
“Times” is pleased to note a change
to “healthy realism.” The cause given
for that change is the good old com-
pelling one of U.N.O. “financial
stringency.”
* * * *
U.S. Leaders’ Errors. —In N. Y.
“Sun” George E. Sokolsky makes no
bones about putting the blame for
Berlin and all involved there square
on U.S. shoulders: “At Tehran and
Yalta Roosevelt permitted Stalin to
arrange for Russian victories in
Europe and Asia which in the total
of history appear more horrible than
anything Hitler imagined, and at
Potsdam, Harry Truman, new to the
job, uncertain as to U.S. commit-
ments, agreed to the implementation
of Tehran and Yalta. So Berlin be-
came the hub of these small mistakes
which ballooned into a world catas-
trophe.”

RECIPE FOR LIBERALS.
“At this moment what the vast majority of
the people want, for themselves as individuals
in their private lives, for- the nation in its
domestic politics and economics, and for their
country as a Power in world affairs, can all be
summed up in five small words: a little peace
and quiet.... The citizen knows full well that
neither his country nor the world can stand
still. Nor does he want them to. But if changes
come he would like them to come gradually
and in orderly fashion, without disturbance or
violence....
“The people are sick to death of ideological
mud-slinging; they are fed-up with domestic
political bickering and partisan sniping; they
are bored to exasperation with prophets of
doom and the promisers of Utopia alike. What
they want is to get on with the job, bring up
the children, anticipate the arrival of the new
car they’ve had on order so long, think about
the dream-house they are going to build one
day, and in the meantime work a little harder,
make a little more money, lay by a little more
for the children and old age, and enjoy life
as much as they can ”
That description closely fits the situa-
tion of the average Australian and his
view of politics today. “A little peace
and quiet” —and commonsense —is the
ideal aim for the combined platform
which the Liberal and Country parties
are preparing for relief of this community
from the revolutionary violence of the
Chifley Government. The above expres-
sion of it is taken from a survey by
Edward Montgomery in the London
“Spectator” of the state today of public
feeling) in the United States. His review
concludes:
What people want is an Administration
and a Congress which will conduct the
nation’s affairs quietly and efficiently, with
a minimum of political controversy and a
maximum of commonsense. The very do-
nothingness of the Republicans in the cur-
rent special session of Congress is likely to
stand to their eventual credit at the polls.
“A little peace and quiet” in order to
get on with the big national
ending of “the disorganisation of private
life. Government control and regulation
of everything, disruption of all peaceful
pursuits and activities.” “A little peace
and quiet,” Which would have a longer
assured life if accompanied by genuine
provision for national defence, for real
expansion of the industrial potential. Is
that so bad an aim for the leaders of an
alternative Government?
What did the Australian people
in the mass enjoy before this Socialist
pack came into power—in those days
before 1939 which it is the Socialist
fashion now to deride?
They could buy petrol at half the
present price, buy all they wanted of it
without question, and drive anywhere in
this continent without being stopped and
examined like criminals. Their ships
sailed to schedule on coastal services or
overseas, and passengers or freight-
handlers could rely on sailing-dates
months ahead. They could come or go on
business abroad without having to seek
Government permission and certainly
without being denied it. There were
trams running to the beaches on Sundays
as sure as the surf itself. The value of
money and the prices of goods were
.stable. There was no shortage of goods
and no black market. People did not
have to travel on holiday trains jammed
and packed worse than cattle in a
truck. Housewives did not have to be-
come beasts of burden in order to pro-
cure daily household necessities, and if
they turned on a gas-tap or an electric-
power switch the supply was ample,
cheap and, above all, certain. There was
plenty of work for all who would work.
Men felt some sense of both responsi-
bility and dignity in doing a job.
It was under the series of Governments
elected by a people which had learned by
hard experience the mountebankeries of
“Labor” that these simple conditions foi*
a reasonably happy and hardworking life
prevailed in the late ’thirties. There were
strikes, of course, arid grievances (as
always) calling for attention, but there
was still discipline in industry and in-
dustrial law could be said to reign. There
was individual hardship, here and there,
but also priceless individual freedom;
there was not so much paper money
about, but there were the desired goods
to be bought with it, and the pound-note
then was (by comparison with this
Socialist age) worth its full value and
not the 10s. or less to which it has shrunk
today.
Since then the war has, of course,
intervened; but the war is now more
than three years behind us. Relatively
we suffered little from it.
Those were “the bad old days” of
1939, as “Labor” holds them —“bad”
only because “Labor” could not get hands
on the “sweets of office,” and esteemed
contemptible because they rejected the
Socialist recipe of abundance for all “by
robbing selected Peter to pay for col-
lective Paul,” and knew not the “brave
new world” —
When all men are paid for existing, and no
man must pay for his sins.
They were chaotic days, too, declare the
Chifley mob in Canberra, chaotic because
there was no Government “planning”
of our daily lives.
There was a percentage of unem-
ployment (and unemployables). There
always is. And by preaching the fantastic
nonsense that in pre-Chifley days unem-
ployment was a universal fear just round
the corner, that no man in this Common-
wealth was really confident of being able
to earn a living without Government
nursemaiding, these Socialists rant about
how they have brought,to every Aus-
tralian “security”—or, rather, since an
election has soon to be faced, not quite
permanent security, because we are not
yet fully socialised, but with another
“Labor” term in office that is to follow.
Perhaps—and at a price. A man can
be “secure” and free from care —in jail.
Let him give up his personal freedom to
“Labor” and he can have a sort of low-
standard “security”—for the term of his
self-imposed sentence. And those allies,
and logical successors, of the Chifley
Socialists have also, in Soviet Russia,
their “security” for all —the security of
the forced-labor camps, where under a
roster maintained by Communist purges
a great percentage of the inhabitants of
Soviet Russia now spend their lives, work-
ing under “control” and “Government
planning” for the “golden age” of world
revolution.
So far as this Commonwealth has got
towards that goal, what has it benefited
the people? What has socialisation and
“security” done for them? Has “full
employment,” has “contentment” with
leisure under the 40-hour week, has
government-by-regulation, given anybody
a sense of permanence, or provided more
of the necessary goods, or made higher
wages worth anything? What else does
true security mean but confidence in the
enjoyment of such results?
“A little peace and quiet” is the last
thing the Socialists intend. “Iron-handed
suppression if we are resisted” was the
threat from the A.L.P. planners of
socialisation in 1933. Said Mr. Chifley
to the N.S.W. “Labor” conference last
June: “The next twelve months may be
a period of violence.” And he told the
Federal A.L.P. meeting in Canberra:
The next Federal elections will be one of
the most bitterly fought in Australia’s
history Sometimes when in office there
is a temptation to become lazy instead of
on the offensive....
A Government elected by a democracy
“on the offensive” against the democratic
way of life! However insane it may
sound, its supreme condemnation is that
it is not Australian, it is abhorrent to
the Australian character, and the only
excuse for it is that by no other policy
does the corrupted and demoralised
“Labor” party see any hope of justifying
its record or its promises, both steeped
in destructive violence. “Without social-
isation,” says Mr. Ward, “ ‘Labor’ cannot
exercise political power.”
The Liberals have their cue. It is to
discipline power-drunk union executives
and restore order to industry; to re-
establish the rule of. Parliament and
abolish the interference of an aggrandised
central bureaucracy with our public and
private life ; to, uphold the dignity and
authority of the law; to remove the
socialisation of finance that exists through
budgeting and central banking; to re-
verse the concentration of factories, popu-
lation, and civilised amenities in the
swollen cities, which have outgrown all
their services and are fatal hostages to
fortune in the atomic-bomb age—in short,
to give the Commonwealth and its people
a chance to recover productive energy,
prosperity and decent community-feeling
from the condition of snarling class-
warfare into which “Labor” has plunged
a land whose natural blessings are the
envy of all others.
No Inheritors.
In the Budget debate at Canberra all
Mr. Chifley’s supporters harped on the
note that it is a “Budget of prosperity.”
Superficially so, perhaps, since no
Federal Treasurer before him has ever
handled so much income-tax revenue,
and the Budget comes at a time when
everybody is employed and Australians,
in comparison with the rest of the world,
are enjoying themselves. But national
prosperity consists of much more than
paper money. This country is in the
position of a seemingly successful man
facing the disturbing thought that what
he has built is likely to go to strangers.
A preliminary count of the 1947 census
shows that what Australians have built
in the past 160 years they can easily lose
in the next 100.
The first census count gives us a popu-
lation-increase of under a million in the
14 years between 1933, when we num-
bered 6,629,839, and 1947 (7,580,820).
Dividing the increase of 950,981 by 14
does not give a true statistical average,
since the next 14 years will differ from
the last, and things like death- and birth-
rates alter; but it gives a yearly average
increase of 68,642. A simple average
struck in the same way for the previous
14 years (1919-33) gives 88,918 as the
yearly increase.
Most of us agree that 1\ million people
in an area of three million square miles,
far from powerful friends and close to
overwhelming numbers of potential
enemies, are in constant danger. To be
reasonably safe we need 20 million white
people, and we can give 20 million whites
a good living. But on that 14-year aver-
which covers immigrants as well as
babies, it will take just on 200 years to
get them. Even were we to be satisfied
with 12i million, Canada’s present popu-
lation, it would take 70 years.
To get more people more rapidly there
must be earlier marriages, a higher birth-
rate, larger families and more immigrants.
Politicians of all parties have never
tackled the problem seriously or cour-
ageously, and for that they are perhaps
not so much to blame as the people who
elect them.
A disturbing revelation in the census
figures is that big-city populations lower
their own birthrate, but increase; them-
selves by drawing from the country popu-
lation, where the birthrate is higher. The
increase of population since 1933 is
mainly, except in Queensland and Tas-
mania, in the six capital cities (Canberra
practically doubled its population, 8947
to 16,905). While the Commonwealth
added 950,981 to its population, the in-
crease outside capital cities was only
about 200,000 (including provincial cities).
The greatest non-metropolitan increase
occurred in the most decentralised State,
Queensland. After 160 years of settle-
ment, more than half the population lives
in six cities, over a third in two —Sydney
and Melbourne.
Earlier marriages . and younger and
larger families are noticeable features of
small communities, but it is little good
their being that way while the big cities
go in for later marriage and smaller
families, and increase themselves by draw-
ing from the smaller communities more
people to follow the city way of life.
Generally, the modem Australian big-
city married couple doesn’t multiply and
often doesn’t replace itself. Existing and
foreseeable city conditions suggest that
the condition will become worse instead
of better. There are now 150,000 fewer
people in the 5-20 years age-group than
in 1933, and the proportion of elderly
people is steadily increasing. *
Linked with all this are two other im-
portant factors, the preppnderance of
females and the female in employment.
The birthrates of practically every in-
dustrialised white country are suffering
similarly. What can be done about it is
another matter, since the working woman
has become such a dominant economic
factor in both industry and commerce
that getting her out might entail another
industrial revolution. . Perhaps 90 per
cent, of the vast sums expended yearly on
advertising in this country is spent to
attract feminine eyes and ears; perhaps
70 per cent, of production of non-capital
manufactured goods is for feminine pur-
chase. Little is spent on either persuad-
ing woman to fulfil her destiny—which
is marriage and motherhood —or on mak-
ing that fulfilment easy. It says much
for her trueheartedness and courage that,
despite the blandishments of commerce
and the obstacles to homemaking, most
women are anxious and willing to make
a home and raise a family if given a
chance to do so.
But “full employment” and “improved
living standards” conspire to deny them
that chance. The first means, among
other things, the enticing of women into
employment in factories, shops and offices
—the young woman is no longer regarded
as a potential wife and mother, but as
an employee in secondary industry; and
what is the popular conception of the
second? To most people “improved
living standards” means nothing more
than more leisure, more radios, more
picture-shows, more racecourses and pubs
and picnics, more beer and gambling,
more clothing, more lollies, more holi-
days—more everything, in short, except
real homes and babies. And shortly we
are to have more politicians, certain to
talk more about the ageing and declining
population when they seek to bring in
more child endowment for the children
who aren’t being produced.
Immigration, so far, offers no -help.
Over 17,700 more people left the coun-
try in 1945-46 than came into it. No
great waves of European immigrants can
be expected; those who do come crowd
into already overcrowded cities and join
in a way of life under which, at present
anyhow, too many married couples
produce only one child. How can Aus-
tralia turn its pattern of life upside-down
so that early marriage and quick pro-
duction of four or five children per
couple come about?
It is a vast and complicated problem,
added to by the social, economic and
political uncertainty of this queer Social-
ist-cwm-sophist age, when industry has
become the football of “Labor” and
Communist unions, and home-making the
subject of jibes from the like of Dedman
about “little capitalists,” But it is an Aus-
tralian-made problem and Australia must
solve it. What it calls for is close and co-
operative study by the nation’s best brains
to evolve an educational and political
drive for more children. Sincerity must
be the essence of the political part of it.
A big job, but it must be tackled.
Empty Shelves.
“Dee”: The publication of a full-length
biography of Edmund Barton, Australia’s
first Prime Minister, fills one more gap in
a row of almost empty shelves. There
must be few countries in the world where
political literature has been so neglected
as in Australia ; certainly there are few
where the lives of distinguished public
men have been so singularly untouched
either by creative or interpretative writ-
ing.
Walter Murdoch’s life of Alfred
Deakin has, all through the past quarter-
century, been the one illuminating
glance at a great Australian who became
a great Prime Minister. On W. M.
Hughes there are one or two things which
are uncritically anecdotal rather than
biographical in the true sense. There is
nothing about Bruce, who was one of the
most significant figures of his day, both
in what he was and what he stood for.
There is nothing about Andrew Fisher or
Scullin, each a Labor Prime Minister in
important periods. Lyons remains un-
touched. A biography of Curtin is in
preparation ; but the searcher for truth
and perspective about our political past
will find nothing about Reid, Watson or
Cook.
Why this should be so in a country
which has initiated important political
trends and where much attention is given
to political affairs is at first difficult to
understand. There are, of course, rea-
sons. One, the bugbear of all creative
high-standard Australian writing, is the
lack of leisure; of all good writing,
biography perhaps most insistently de-
mands long and careful research and
preparation. *
Another is the undoubted fact that if
a writer is not satisfied with the in-
tangible rewards of a labor of love he
is not likely to be attracted to a field in
which best-sellers are exceedingly few
and far between.
Another, deeper reason may be that the
Australian mind is too focused on the
immediate and the spectacular, to bother
about bringing the past into perspective.
Yet another may be the newspaper-con-
ceived blight which hangs over all public
life in this country, with its tacit assump-
tion that all “politicians” are stupid or
corrupt. Those affected by this latter
complex should take time out to read
Murdoch’s fine study of a Prime Minis-
ter who would have adorned the public
life of any country in any age.
The saddening thing about these empty
shelves is that the men who could write
authoritatively and at first hand about
the big men of the past —not only Prime
Ministers —are themselves passing on.
Great biography is not necessarily writ-
ten by people contemporary with the per-
sons dealt with, but in practice most of it
is; first-hand knowledge is of priceless
value in building a true portrait.
The ironic footnote to it all is that in
dozens of bookshops scattered through-
out the land, some of them under self-
evident Communist direction, but many
of them not, it is possible to purchase
“lives” of Lenin and Stalin, of Marx and
Trotsky and all the rest of them.
The job of filling the empty shelves
falls partly to the Commonwealth
Literary Fund, which has done good
work in other directions but which lacks
the financial resources to plan large-scale
biographical or any other kind of work.
There is a practice followed in Canberra
of commissioning an artist to paint a
portrait of, among other eminent folk,
each Prime Minister. A good thing ; but
how infinitely better if the money went
into a book which could reach the hands
of every young Australian growing up in
the democratic tradition instead of a
study in oils seen only by those who
happen to pass through Canberra.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Reds and Red Herrings.
No distortion-mirror in a Luna Park
show could have provided a more
ludicrous picture of the C.S.I.R. case than
Prime Minister Chifley and Mr. Dedman
attempted in Parliament last week.
For months past Messrs. Chifley and
Dedman have been denying or pooh-
poohing Opposition suggestions that Com-
munists and near-Communists in Govern-
ment departments, and particularly in the
C.5.1.R., have or could obtain access to
secrets concerning the development of
atomic or rocket weapons. Specifically,
Ministers have denied rumors that, be-
cause of American doubts of the security
of such secrets in Australia from Com-
munist spies, the U.S. Government has
refused to entrust even the U.K. Govern-
ment with certain secrets if the Australian
Government could thereby have access to
them.
In reply to a specific question Mr. Ded-
man repeated the denials in the debate on
the line in the Estimates: “Nuclear energy,
C.5.1.R., £31,750.” There might be “one
or two Communists” employed by the
C.5.1.R., he said, but there had been no
leakage. Nobody, he conveyed, was
worried about the position.
Then Mr. Fadden, holding up papers,
asked whether Dedman would deny that
Mr. Chifley discussed with British
Cabinet Ministers in London on July 8
the U.S. Government’s reluctance as de-
scribed. Fadden read from a docu-
ment what purported to be a report by
Mr. Chifley of that discussion. He also
quoted from another document Mr. Ded-
man’s statements at a subsequent C.S.I.R.
executive meeting, recording:
(1) That “the Prime Minister had told
hjm a fortnight ago that information from
high sources in the U.K. had been received
which made it quite clear that U.K. Gov-
ernment departments were not certain that
the C.S.I.R. could be entrusted with cer-
tain information.”
(2) That while he and Mr. Chifley thought
there was no justification for this U.K.
feeling, the point was that it existed.
(3) The Government would have to see
how the position could b.e retrieved.
(4) That the Attorney-General’s depart-
ment had told him that control over
C.S.I.R. personnel, in the matter of keep-
ing information secret, was much looser
than in Government departments under the
Public Service Board, and “was, in fact,
practically useless.”
(5) That there were more Communists
in the C.S.I.R. than in any other depart-
ment.
(6) If the C.S.I.R. was to do defence
work its whole structure would have to be
changed.
Although Mr. Chifley has made much
play with the suggestion that this docu-
ment is a forgery, there is every sign that
the Government recognises, it as an
authentic record of the alleged C.S.I.R.
meeting. Mr. Fadden offered to hand
over documents if the P.M. would admit
the truth of what they convey—which so
far Mr. Chifley refuses.
First consequences have been:
(1) A denial from London that records
of British Cabinet meetings have been or
could be stolen, because in fact no records
of meetings are taken. Mr.-Chifley himself
supported with a denial that anything he
had discussed in London had leaked out
■ from Britain.
(2) Announcement by Dedman that a bill
would be introduced promptly to transfer
part of the C.S.I.R. to Dept, of Supply and
Development.
(3) Announcement by Dedman that two
Communists he had appointed to C.S.I.R.
staff, “on recommendation of the execu-
tive,” and of whose Communistic interests
he “had not been aware,” would be dealt
with by the same legislation.
Next events were:
(1) Mr. Chifley’s announcement that he
would put the Security police on to “super-
vising the activities” of members of Parlia-
ment and others who are only in the House
by special privilege.
(2) The Melbourne University laboratory
conducting the “nuclear research” experi-
ments, on the vote in aid of which the
debate began, was destroyed by fire (the
third fire in Melbourne University labora-
tories this year).
(3) Security police sought to question
Mr. Fadden in his Parliamentary rooms,
- and he refused to answer any questions
except in the presence of the press.
> Prime Minister Chifley might, for once,
admit some cogency in current press
comments, and after he has had a look
at the Sandys case in the House of
he should be susceptible to
second thoughts. Mr. Fadden is
thoroughly justified in his stand by the
Commons case, though he had not the
precedent handy.
Net results to date; Two Communists
are at last to be removed from C.S.I.R.
employment.
Coal and a Union Squabble.
An argument over which union is to have
the right to collect tribute from 60 men
engaged in driving a rock-tunnel from
Mt. Kembla to Mt. Keira has tied up the
N.S.W. South Coast collieries, causing a
loss in production of 10,000 tons a day.
The men are A.W.U. members, and the
Miners’ Federation is insisting that they
should be on its books, despite the fact
that the men are not coalminers and don’t
want to join the Communist show.
On Friday the Federation’s executive
decided not to extend the strike at present,
but the past history of the Miners’ Fed-
eration, Communist-controlled as in
France, where the Comrades are doing
their damnedest to bring that country’s
industry to a standstill, leaves little room
for doubt that if Federation-president
Idris Williams and his fellow-Reds
choose to do so they can bulldoze
mass meetings into agreeing to a general
stoppage, bringing chaos to industry
throughout the country and unemploy-
ment to large numbers of Australian
wage-earners. And this simply because
of the desire of the Federation to keep a
union that will have no truck with Com-
munism out of “a sphere of influence” it
considers its own property.
The matter of the tunnel is really a try-
out, and is part of the bigger argument
as to which union is to rule the destinies
of the men to be employed in the Blair
Athol (Q.) opencut mines the Hanlon
Government is arranging to exploit with
the aid of British capital. The Federation
knows that if A.W.U. men are to work
Blair Athol its power to blackmail Aus-
tralian industry and Australian “Labor”
Governments through its domination of
the N.S.W. coalfields is gone for ever —
and with it goes the biggest weapon of
the Australian Communist party.
High Cost of McGirr.
The people of N.S.W. will have had
enough of McGirr before next election-
day comes. Caucus in Macquarie-street
was badly frightened six months ago
when it had to raise first-section tram
and bus fares by a penny and rail fares
by 10 per cent. It is getting more
frightened pow. The process has to con-
tinue.
The State Auditor-General’s report
must sound to Caucus like the crack of
doom:
The Government’s road-transport under-
takings are in a grave financial plight....
prospects dismal unless there are substan-
tial increases in earnings... .rapidly rising
costs of government... .more losses in the
Railways Department.
He quotes alarming figures of drift into
losses, and says that “more than 70
per cent, of the extra cost in tram and
bus undertakings occurred in wages and
salaries”:
So straitened have their cash resources
become, following a series of heavy losses,
that neither was able to meet its full obli-
gations for interest or sinking-fund charges.
So the McGirr Government must raise
all tram and bus fares again—on other
than first sections this time. Next year
that process will almost certainly have to
be repeated.
Part of the loss of revenue has been
because of the McGirrs’ inability to pro-
vide Sunday services to the beaches, and
the backlash of that is hurting the Mc-
Girrs, too. And so it justly should.
It was the McGirr Government which
made things difficult for the Federal
Arbitration Court by legislating for
a 40-hour week during the hearing
and in advance of the Court’s finding.
It also sent counsel to “assist” the Court
by representing that the McGirr Govern-
ment could meet any extra cost of the
40-hour week without difficulty.
That was a little over a year ago. Mr.
McGirr, in fact, had no preparations to
meet the impact of fewer hours, and had
hot even prepared rosters for the trans-
port services. He did not know how much
if, would cost the Treasury or State indus-
tries or add to the prices of all commodi-
ties by reason of extra freight charges.
He didn’t know and he didn’t care.
The public will have to pay trebly for
this political chicanery—once as users of
State services, twice as consumers of
goods and yet again as taxpayers. It
will go on paying through the nose, for
the rises in these things are steadily lift-
ing each other higher, and the shorter
week means the transport services can’t
find enough hands to run them fully or
efficiently.
That is what voting for “Labor” and
McGirr meant. The McGirr Caucus is
now committed to explaining why that
should be.
Threat to Queensland.
Queensland Opposition, never satisfied
about the votes of the last State election
or the condition of the State rolls, re-
turned to the matter in the Brisbane Par-
liament last week. Mr, Power, the Acting
Attorney-General, replying to a sug-
gestion that the State rolls should be
based on Federal rolls, said that the latter
were in a “deplorable condition” and
wouldn’t replace the State rolls.
Mr. Power hardly got out “deplorable
condition” when the Opposition fell on
him like a ton of bricks. Charges of
“ghost” voters and “stacked” rolls burst
out, and “Labor” members yelled back.
Then Opposition-leader Nicklin made
specific charges:
Enrolment for the \9fl State election was
697,405, or nearly 40,000 more than Queens-
land’s total adult population.
Net reduction in enrolments between the
elections and the end of the year was 43,502.
Even now, after an intensive police check,
the total enrolment of 674,104 at June 30
was still only 23,301 fewer than at the 1947
election.
Evidence extending over 32 years showed
that Labor legislation and administration

“The return to the Commonwealth of Australian girls who were 'allowed’ to work for the U.S. Government in Manila and
Tokyo is being demanded by Mr. Calwell.”

created inflated electoral rolls, which pro-
vided opportunities for corrupt practices at
elections.
The preliminary count of the 1947
census should interest both Mr. Power
and Mr. Nicklin. It gives the total
Queensland population, aboriginals and
all, as 1,106,269. The 1947 enrolment,
deducted from the population, leaves the
State with only 408,864 persons under
the age of 21. Put in another way, there
are 288,541 more adults than minors. Yet
in 1946 Queensland, with 24.8 per 1000,
was only 0.1 per 1000 behind South Aus-
tralia for the highest birthrate of the
mainland States, Tasmania having 27.1
and the Commonwealth 23.6. But assum-
ing that the electoral rolls are 100 p.c.
correct, Queensland is dying on its feet.
Mr. Power had other ideas about the
figures. He said that the State electoral
officer’s report stated that “a 64 p.c. adult
population was the minimum to be ex-
pected from the last census, meaning that
Queensland’s adult population in 1947
was not fewer than 707,000 —47,000 more
than the number on which Mr. Nicklin
based his attack.” If that is so the number
of minors is reduced to 399,269 in a
population of 1,106,269, or 36 p.c. In
1933 the proportion of youngsters was
40 p.c.
Whatever these figures may suggest m
the matter of the cleanliness or otherwise
of the State rolls they mean ultimate
disaster for Queensland unless there is a
rapid improvement in the proportion of
young people to old. And that is some-
thing that should be worrying politicians
of all parties.
POLITICAL POINTS
Flying a kite, someone has suggested
that the status of Dominion repre-
sentatives in London be raised from
that of High Commissioner to Ambassa-
dor. The “Times,” with that indulgent
air it sometimes adopts towards the
Dominions, comments: “If the High
Commissioners desire the title ‘Excellency
this should not be withheld,” but points
out that an Ambassador is essentially an
envoy from a foreign sovereign, and the
King can’t very well send an Ambassador
to himself. If Australia’s High Commis-
sioner has been losing sleep because the
British Table of Precedency doesn’t place
him between the pephews
and the Archbishop of Canterbury it is
time those who appointed him told him to
keep his mind on his work.
Calwell, letting up for a moment from
his pursuit of the escaped Australian
typists, assured the House that “the
Government was keeping a watchful eye
on all those people who might do any-
thing to govern-
ment in this country.” Reassuring news ;
“all those people” would, of course, in-
clude Arthur’s team-mate Ward, who had
a few days previously told a Sydney
Trades Hall audience that, irrespective of
what the Privy Council might decide,
“once Labor has spoken and said the
banks are to be nationalised the issue is
beyond doubt. It is only a question of
when we shall be able to do it.”
Manuilsky, who represents the Ukraine
at U.N.O. meetings and shouts the Mos-
cow line when the Soviet delegate’s
throat needs a rest, came out with a
savage attack on Bevin for suggesting
that “no one knew what went on inside
Russia.” He claimed that the Western
Powers did not want to know; if t-hey
did they could find out by reading the
Soviet press or by asking their own repre-
sentatives in Russia. Two days labvr the
Soviet announced new regulations which
have the effect of confining foreign diplo-
mats and their staffs to the city of
Moscow.
If Russia really wants the atom bomb
she’s going the right way to get it.
Clive Evatt’s N S.W. Housing Com-
mission a few months ago reported that
for the year ended June 30, 1946, the
Commission had “completed 2111 dwel-
lings, 2547 were under construction and
contracts had been entered into for the
erection of a further 2981 units, a grand
total of 7639 homes.” A graph showed
the “number of homes built or under
construction” during the year as close on
4700. The Auditor-General’s report
just issued states that in the four
years ended June 30, 1948, the Commis-
sion “built 6555 brick and timber-framed
houses, converted 3533 military huts and
built 470 sleep-outs.” Questions for those
interested are (1) How many huts and
sleep-outs make a home? (2) How many
people can sleep on a foundation-stone?
“Government,” remarked Carlyle, “is
emphatically a machine: to the discon-
tented a taxing-machine, to the contented
a machine for securing property.” His
words are borne out by the Common-
wealth Parliamentary Standing Committee
on Public Works. It recommends the
spending of £1,275,400 of tax money on
erecting a block of Commonwealth offices
in Brisbane; “securing property” all
right, though not in the Carlyle sense.
Stafford Cripps, Britain’s Chancellor
of the Exchequer, told New York press-
men that an improvement in
standard of living could be expected by
1952. No one thought to ask him whether
he was basing his opinion on a Gallup-
poll forecast that “Labor” would go out
of office in 1950.
Victoria, WA. and N.S.W. wheat-
growers have voted for the latest “stabili-
sation” plan and the remaining poll will
be taken in S.A. next Tuesday. Figures:
For. Against.
Victoria 11*275 3,495
Western Australia .. 3,957 2,426
New South Wales .. 8,951 6,360
Mr. Graham, McGirr’s Minister for Agri-
culture, is pleased with the N.S.W. vote,
though only about two-thirds of the
State’s growers voted; he holds that the
“No” arguments were misleading. That
remains to be seen, as also does the
“Labor” claim that the vote in the three
States is a vote of confidence in “Labor.”
Aikens, the Mundingburra “Ind. Lab.”
member in the Brisbane Parliament,, has
let it out that after “secret conferences be-
tween Labor, C.P. and Q.P.P- d s
planned to increase Ministerial salaries by
£750 a year and members’ by £2OO. Re-
porters who became curious found all
hands remarkably coy.
Lord Bruce, speaking of the confer-
ence of Dominion Prime Ministers, sug-
gested that some Dominions are suffering
from an inferiority complex. This is un-
doubtedly true of some Dominion Minis-
ters. How else can be explained the
foolish outburst of Calwell over the Aus-
tralian typists controversy when he said
“he could see no reason why he should
make it easy for anybody, and particu-
larly the representatives of a Great
Power, to escape or fail to fulfil their ob-
ligations to this country”?
Those who maintain that in a referen-
dum there is a tendency for electors to
vote “No” out of sheer pigheadedness
should study the voting on two questions
put to the people of Greater Wollongong
(N.S.W.). They were asked to say (on
separate ballot-papers) whether they de-
sired council elections to be held (1) on a
basis of five wards with three aldermen
each or (2) 15 wards with one alderman
each, A majority voted “Yes” for each
alternative.
The Prime Minister in a fireside chat
over a commercial radio network:
Australia and New Zealand have main-
tained their freedom and will do so for the
reason that the standards of living in our
countries and economic and social con-
ditions generally give little scope for those
who claim there are alternative and better
ways of life.
Platitudinous pap for What did
high standards of living and good social
conditions avail Norway, Denmark,
Holland and Belgium when the invaders
came? Without adequate defence —in a
practical form, not merely in the shape
of blueprints—high living standards are
merely a standing temptation 4 fo aggres-
sors.
Transport Minister Ward on the sug-
gestion of investigations into the affairs
of members: “If there is going to be an
investigation let us take the lid off every-
thing.” Lots of things have lids, Eddie.
H. B. Burstall, chairman of Haughton
Sugar Co., Giru (Q.), became slightly
worked-up over taxation at a share-
holders’ meeting and concluded: “It lies
in your hands to remove this wicked,
soulless, extravagant, spineless, gutless,
Commo Government.” If he’s not care-
ful Mr. Burstall will be offered a “Labor”
selection.
Britain’s Socialist Government at least
retains some regard for political de-
cencies. When Minister for War Shin-
well accused the Conservatives of wanting
a war —“they would be pleased if the
international crisis developed” —Prime
Minister Attlee promptly invited him to
stop making unfair attacks on political
opponents and to keep off foreign affairs.
Some of our own Socialists aren’t nearly
so particular what they say, who they
attack or how dirty the attack is.
Though Australian “domestic airlines”
carried 39 p.c, more passengers and 110
p.c. more freight in 1947-48 than in the
previous year—a fact which has State
railway authorities horribly worried—the
Canberra-run show, T-A.A., showed a
loss of well over £250,000 for the year,
making its total loss since it began in
1946 £808,257. No wonder the Chifleys
don’t want to “nationalise” hamburger
joints and ice-cream carts.
From New York comes a report of
“an uncanny bomb, designed to guide its
own fall on to enemy ships, factories,
oil-refineries and other targets giving off
heat.” Described as a heat-seeking
bomb, it is said to “home-in” on any
target giving off more heat than its sur-
roundings. If our own defence authori-
ties carry out any experiments with the
bomb they had better keep it out of range
of the Canberra hot-air factory.
By the simple process of winning the
Buckingham seat at a by-election
“Labor’s” strength in the Tasmanian
Upper House has been doubled. Govern-
ment leader T. G. de Largie D’Alton’s
party will now consist of himself and J.
B. Connolly. The two should have
plenty in common besides their socialisa-
tion pledge—D’Alton makes no secret of
his fondness for punting on dog-races;
Connolly is a Hobart bookie.
It cost Imperial Chemical Industries
£25 in fines and costs in the Full Arbi-
tration Court in Melbourne for sacking
a woman who refused to join Thornton’s
Red Racket, the Ironworkers’ Union, be-
cause she “didn’t want to join a Com-
munist union.” The girl said she was a
member of the Arms, Explosives and
Munition Workers’ Union. An 1.C.1.
works-manager said he told the girl that
the company had an award with the Iron-
workers, didn’t want another union in
the factory, could not have rival factions
among its employees and gave her a
week’s notice. TTie Court ordered her
reinstatement. The co.’s solicitor asked
the Court if it realised that its decision
was against “industrial peace,” where-
upon Judge Kelly said, “You are saying:
‘For the sake of preserving peace at all
costs the rights of the individual shall
be trampled upon.’ For my part I will
not accept that.”
The Victorian Government has had
brutal attacks on policemen. A new
measure provides for jail without the
option for police bashers and for those
who attack anybody assisting a policeman.
Fines have been no deterrent, since the
convicted thug either got “time to pay”
or his mates of both sexes threw in to
make, it up. In future it’s straight to jail
for these unpleasant gentry, an example
which other States might well follow.
New Guinea timber is fast-growing
stuff, and the trees in the Bulolo Valley
that are the unwitting cause of the con-
spiracy charge against “Jock” and Har-
court Garden, Ray Parer and Edward
Farrell will be somewhat taller by the
time the case is heard. Date originally
fixed was August 3, but an adjournment
was grants on the grounds of Farrell’s
ill-health. Last week a further adjourn-
ment to December was sought, Farrell still
being “very ill.” Judge Lloyd heard both
sides on the matter and fixed the trial for
November 8.
Q.P.P. is the latest political party to
come out in favor of subdividing Queens-
land into new States. The Country party
had already advocated the move, and
Premier Hanlon not so long ago gave a
sort of a kind of approval to it. Q.P.P.
convention proposes the appointment of
separate Ministers for North and Central
Queensland “to assist those areas to form
separate States.”
An odd conception of the secrecy
of the ballot appeared when N.S.W.
wheatgrowers received their ballot-papers
for the poll on wheat-“stabilisation.”
The face of the envelope in which the
ballot-paper was to be sent to the return-
ing-oflicer bore a space in which the voter
was instructed to print his full name in
block letters, his guarantee of secrecy
being in the words: “When this envelope
is being opened it will be placed face
downward so that the voter’s name will
not be visible.” Since all wheatgrowers
are registered and no man may grow
wheat without a licence, no farmer could
be blamed for supposing that his guaran-
tee of secrecy was rather weak. Which
may account for the fact that only about
two-thirds of the N.S.W. growers re-
corded votes.
Communists and “Labor” militants
who follow their lead profess to regard
the secret ballot as a “cowards’ castle.”
Sydney suburbanites who depend on
trams for transport prefer its old-
fashioned title as a “bastion of de-
mocracy.” At the behest of “mass” meet-
ings attended by a few hundred malcon-
tents they had endured three months of
tramless Sundays; on Friday a secret
ballot of 4000 tramwaymen showed a big
majority against the Red-inspired stop-
page, and trams ran on all routes last
Sunday. Secret ballots would not stop
all strikes, but they would make the task
of Communist trouble-makers much
more difficult.
Herbert Morrison recently had some-
thing to say to British trade-unionists that
might well be considered by the rank and
file of the Miners’ Federation, now
threatening a widespread hold-up be-
cause of the conflict with the A.W.U. on
the N. S, Wales South Coast, though it
would be wasted on their Red leaders:
The worker now has the ball at his feet.
But if he exploits his advantage against
the community’s needs as selfishly as the
old employer did when he was on top,
the great victories of trade-unionism will
melt away, and will deserve to melt.
No Australian “Labor” leader has had
the courage to tell the unions that, al-
though the .truth of it must be patent to
many of them. Ministers, State and
Federal, have by their own weakness and
by their failure to support the stand taken
by their own conciliators and Tribunal
encouraged the miners’ leaders to go from
one excess to another until they feel there
is no limit to their power. Given a Gov-
ernment that really governed it would be
unthinkable that such a petty issue could
develop into such a serious threat, but
there is nothing in the previous record of
the Prime Minister and “Fixer” Ashley
to suggest that if Williams and Co. want a
general coal hold-up they will have the
ability or guts to avert it.

The young men flying the country’s
civil aircraft are a fine bunch, mostly
with war experience, and it’s not until
a plane has a mishap that the flying public
hears something of their records. Captain
A. L. Hubbard, who brought A.N.A.’s
Kanana down safely in a paddock near
Yass last week, with one engine burning,
collected a D.F.C. and D.S.O. in the last
shindy. The first gong he won for bril-
liant night-flying in 1940 ; the other was
the result of a series of successful Euro-
pean bombing raids three years later. In
one of these he captained one plane of
a trio that blew part of Krupps out of
action for 10 days. His dismissal by
A.N.A., whatever the grounds may be,
will not alter public feeling that in
getting his plane down without loss of
life he showed guts and skill of a typically
high order,

colonel, and last saw him a year later,
then a brigadier in Malaya H.Q. Com-
mand. Tall and loose-limbed, with a
vital personality, Chaudhuri’s short hair,
clipped moustache and clean-cut features
have often led to his being mistaken for
an Englishman. Returning from a trip
to U.K. during the war one of his fellow-
travellers commented disparagingly on
India and Indians. His “English” listener
stood it for a while, then somewhat
vehemently corrected the other’s impres-
sions. Surprised, the detractor said, “You
seem to have a lot of sympathy for
Indians.” “Why .not?” retorted Chaud-
huri. “I am an Indian!”
Dr. Ted Bowen, 0.8. E., Ph.D., M.Sc.,
a Welshman now with the C.5.1.R., is one
of the back-room boys. Heth drew him
while he was telling the office ex-service-
men how he and Robert Watson Watt
saw their first plane-echo jump on
Britain’s first operative radar set. One
day in June, 1935, a Scapa twin-engined
flying-boat was flying unconcernedly up
and down on exercises off Orfordness,
on England’s east coast. Below it three
scientists bent over a machine they’d
sweated on for a month, anxiously turn-
ing range and amplitude dials. Across
the face of a green tube, a strangely-
glowing dial into Whose likeness thou-
sands of men were to peer within the
next few years, a speeding dot of light
moved so fast it made a continuous
white fine. The plane roared overhead,
TED BOWEN, Pioneer of Radar .
and the line stretched unbroken. Again
and again it made its run, and then the
white line shivered, broke, fell back, then
leapt into an oscillating steeple of light,
The range scale beneath its left edge
showed 17 miles. Tense with excitement,
Watt grabbed a phone and rang the
plane’s base, asking for the aircraft to
be ordered to continue its runs. , “Who
the blazes are you?” an irate voice an-
swered him. “Go to hell! ” So the plane
landed, but history had been made. In
1941, with radar established, Bowen
crossed the Atlantic to let the Americans
in on its secrets. Working now on radar
and radio for civil purposes —he has been
appointed to the Lutana plane crash
inquiry commission—Bowen is an honest
as well as a distinguished scientist. He
admits his recreations are washing-up and
looking after his three nippers.
It doesn’t need the baton in Coventry’s
sketch to fix Prof. John Bishop’s
profession—expressive hands, long hair
and colorful clothes do it just as well.
Recently appointed to directorship of
Adelaide’s Conservatorium, Bishop left
the same Con. 25 years ago to study in
England on an Elder scholarship. Later,
at the Royal College of Music, he learned
the refinements of baton-waving under
Malcolm Sargent and Adrian Boult.

“Trinco” on an up-and-down explorer:
Professor Auguste Piccard, the man who hopes
to lower himself in a metal sphere 2i miles
into the black, pressure-pounding waters on
the Cape Verde Islands, looks the part. Tall and
thin,, with a long, narrow face and a high
intellectual forehead heightened by balding spots
encroaching on his lank, tousled hair, Piccard
fits the comic-strip conception of a scientist
perfectly. But, though his adventures, bpth up
and down, will match anything the imagination
can conceive, they are far from comic. Piccard
was teaching in Belgium when the stratosphere
first beckoned him, up into space where man
had never gone before. To get there he invented
the stratosphere balloon, which, 1 instead of the
usual open basket, depended from it an im-
mensely strong airtight metal sphere. In 1931,
at Augsburg, Germany, the explorer cast oft
his moorings and soared 51,458 ft. into the blue.
Eighteen hours later he came down unhurt on
an Austrian glacier. Still not satisfied, the
next year, starting from his native Switzerland,
he reached 2000 ft. higher. Now, sponsored by
the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Re-
search, he hopes to explore in a tiny air chamber
the everlasting night 2i miles under the Atlantic.
Piccard in his quest for knowledge has faced,
and faces, unimaginable danger. In the strato-
sphere the least fault in design would have
caused the enormous outward pressure to blow
his body to shreds: under the crushing weight
of miles of water he would be squeezed to pulp.
It takes the nerves of a hero to challenge forces
of that sort.
The motto of the Victorian R.A.S. is
“Speed the Plough.” It is fitting that its

the agricultural and the industrial sense

Manufacturers and the R.A.S, —the only
man to hold both positions at the same
time. An old boy of Scotch College, he

Three Australian brothers, all Seventh

Tacoma Park, Maryland (U.S.). Two of
them, twins, Dr. Clifford Anderson and

to continue his ministerial studies. He
crossed to America, became an M.D. and

four years with Tooth’s before graduating
to the beverage aristocracy. His main
concern at the moment is with the Aus-
tralian Wine Producers’ Association’s
Wine Week, to be held in Sydney during
October 18-25, the first wine congress
convened here since the war. The in-
dustry’s troubles will be discussed, there
will be suggestions offered to improve its
output and there will be some wine-
tasting.
“Cauboy”: Unless there is another
Carte to carry on the tradition, the death
of Rupert D’Oyly Carte (B. 29/9/’4B)
ends a remarkable dynasty of im-
presarios. Grandfather Richard opened
his concert- and theatre-agency in
London in 1870 and started peddling the
talents of musicians like Patti, Mario and
Gounod, His great chance came when
he met Sullivan and Gilbert. In 1875
he produced “Trial by Jury,” and sub-
sequently every one of the pair’s operas
had its first showing at his hands at the
Savoy Theatre, built specially for the
purpose. In 1887 he tried to establish a
permanent house for grand opera by
British composers, but new operas weren’t
sufficiently numerous to keep it going.
He died at 57 and his wife carried on
until 1913. Rupert, her youngest, picked
the torch up and made it blaze even
brighter with his astonishingly successful
American tours.
“Morehead”: Until a few months before
his death last week in Adelaide, S. Talbot
Smith had been a regular Bulletin para-
graphs! for 55 years, with hardly a break for
any week, except during a holiday in England
in 1927. As a young lawyer in 1893, with
more leisure than was welcome, he embarked
on freelance journalism and wrote leaders
in the lighter vein and book reviews for
Adelaide “Advertiser” and “Register.” His
first appearance in The Bulletin was in
the “Answers” column: “S.T.S.: You cavort
too much.” He was quick to take note, boiled
his copy down, attracted the eye of J. F. Archi-
bald, and gradually came to be depended upon
for personal, dramatic, art and sporting notes
from Adelaide. Born at Kensington (S.A.) in
1861, “S.T.S.” was sent to England as a child and
did not return till he had finished with school,
Cambridge and the Middle Temple. For oyer
20 years he was on the Council of Adelaide
University, and was president of the National
Gallery and Museum, Institutes’ Assoc, of S.A.,
Literary Societies Union, and the S.A. Amateur
Athletic Assoc. In later life he was chairman
of the Advisory Board of the Commonwealth
Literary Fund (which brought him an 0.8. E.)
and president of Adelaide’s Repertory Theatre.
An easy style and a long memory gave him a
reputation “on the air”; and he published a
small volume of thoughtful verse and essays.
“S.T.S.” claimed to have seen every old-time
actor, and to have known personally every
old-time cricketer bar F. S. Jackson. Profes-
sionally he was an old “family” lawyer; in
World War I he made out more than 4000
wills for the boys in camp. (His son Eric, a
foundation cadet of Duntroon, is reputed to
have been the first man ashore at Anzac Beach.)
But at heart “S.T.S.” was a journalist, and
his copy, neatly typed on small slips of paper,
was a joy to sub-editors and printers. It was
said of him that he had never made an enemy,
and he certainly never wrote a malicious line
in his life. S. H. Prior, himself originally a
South Australian, once said to him “The trouble
with you, Talbot, is that you can’t forget you
are a gentleman.”
“Pronto”: Surely the finest collection
of fair-dinkum blackthorns in the country
is owned by Harry Bambrick, now man-
aging a cinema in Fitzroy, Vic. His
shillelaghs number 20, and include the
weightiest and knobbiest in the land. The
daddy of the lot was brought out from
Ireland in 1850. Also in the collection is
perhaps the lightest of these famous
sticks, but a perfect specimen. Others in-
clude a stick in orthodox style fashioned
of rhinoceros hide ; another is an Indian
carved message-stick. One is a Japanese
example in the shape of a joss, and an-
other with an interesting history is a
noble specimen presented by the Duke of
Connaught to the noted Thespian,
Charlie O’Meara. Originally hailing from
the old-time Earl of Zetland hotel in
Ballarat, Bambrick now conducts a resi-
dential. The shillelaghs are for show only.
Into the silence:
In Melbourne, Thomas Robertson Campbell,
chairman of directors of United Distilleries,
who came here from Scotland in 1903 as repre-
sentative of Dewar’s, of which he was a direc-
tor. He was hon. secretary of Melbourne Scots
and a member of the Royal Caledonian Society.
At Redcliffe (Brisbane), at 90, F. B. Ford,
retired Surveyor-General of Queensland. He
started in Queensland in 1881 as a jackeroo
on Peak Downs station, near Clermont, took
on surveying and in 1916 became deputy
Surveyor-General. Until his retirement in 19-9
he represented the Surveyors’ Board at Queens-
land University.
At Heidelberg (Vic.), at 70, Harry Bromilow
Harrison, portraifand landscape painter, whose
work hangs in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane
and Castlemaine galleries. He was a skilled
illustrator, and was cartoonist for some years
on Brisbane “Observer,” later becoming art
critic of the “Argus” and “Australasian.” Most
of his work was done around Eaglemont, where
he lived near the site of the famous art school.
In Toowoomba (Q.), at 80, A. A. Boyce,
who spent nearly half his lifetime surveying
and exploring in Africa. Joining the Gold
Coast Administration as a surveyor in 1902,
he helped to plan Omdurman, the largest native
city in Africa, and explored country then un-
visited by white men. In 1918 he was awarded
the Gill Memorial Prize for outstanding achieve-
ment in geodetical survey, and four years later
became Surveyor-General of the Sudan. He
returned home in 1932 and retired. His son
is first secretary to the British Enibassy in Japan.
In Melbourne, Thomas Sutterby, well known
on the Australian stage and in radio and a
one-time actor in England. He was producer
for the Melbourne Repertory Theatre at Middle
Park of late years.
At 89, in Adelaide, Ellen Grace Light,
last remaining link in Australia of Colonel
William Light, who planned the City of Adel-
aide. Her father, Arnold Light, second cousin
to Col. Light, came to Australia in 1845.

“Howie Wing”: Add to “O.R.’s”
survey of Maoriland’s ghost ports (B.
18/8/’4B) the curious case of a N.S.W.
coastal village. Once the centre of a sub-
stantial maritime trade, the place now
seldom sees a vessel loading or unloading.
Old hands say that the men who formerly
worked the ships now study political
philosophy. The town still stands as a
sporting centre on the shores of Port
Jackson.

“Gee”; One of the summer problems
of western Queensland, only slightly
less annoying than the dust, the flies and
the beer shortage, is radio static and in-
terference. Just as one is really interested
in a programme, something else chops in
rendering further listening impossible.
One old-timer has managed to solve the
problem, at least to his own satisfaction.
He brought a mantel-set in to the radio-
shop for repairs and the mechanic noticed
that most of the stations had been
scratched from the dial with a penknife.
When the mechanic asked him why
he grunted, “There’s a darn sight too
many stations butting in and spoiling the
programmes, so I cut out all the little
’uns.”

“Curtain Raiser”; Whatever can be
said artistically for the. current grand-
opera season in Melbourne, it will cer-
tainly go down as the most conservative
in local history. Previous seasons have
presented operas new to Australia and
comparatively new to Europe, like the
opulent “Turandot” of Puccini, “L’Amore
dei Tre Re” of Montemezzi, Bellini’s
Druidical drama “Norma,” and even
some of the local operas of Fritz Hart
and an occasional Wagnerian effort.
Every one of these was successful and
gave opera a much-needed fillip. The
present issue is the usual repertoire of
every band of strolling Italian players,
except “Otello,” and there are some
doubts as to whether Verdi’s greatest
achievement will be sandwiched in before
the season closes.

“Helldud”: A man may think he is
master in his own house, but in nine
cases out of ten it is Mum whom the
nippers regard as the boss. I had this
brought home to me years ago when I
asked my seven-year-old son who he
thought paid for the food he was putting
away. He replied, “Mum, o’ course,”
and seemed surprised that I should ask
such a stupid question. My position was
settled beyond all doubt not long after-
wards when his sistfcr was clearing the
dinner-table. Bearing a plate on which
reposed a large piece of left-over steak
she asked her mother, “Shall I give this
steak to the dog or keep it for Daddy’s
breakfast?”
* * * *
“Jemac”: A press report concerning
the death of the English racehorse Brown
Jack stated that his great courage was
due to the fact that his heart weighed
a record 191 b. Actually the heart is as
little concerned with courage—except in
a purely mechanical degree—as it is with
love. What decide on fight or flight are
the two little adrenal glands, one perched
atop each kidney. Under stress of strong
emotion these glands discharge adrenalin
into the bloodstream. The drug makes the
heart beat faster and stronger and stops
the action of digestion. Blood is drawn
from the digestive organs and pumped
to the heart, brain and muscles. The
liver is stimulated to discharge its reserve
supply of glycogen, greatly increasing the
blood’s sugar supply. At the same time
the blood-vessels contract, heightening
blood-pressure. The individual, or
animal, is thus better prepared for what-
ever action his brain decides may be
necessary—to stand and fight or to turn
and run.

“Muskeen”: Nudes on banknotes (B.
29/9/’4B) are an innovation, but Spain
once issued a postage-stamp bearing a
reproduction of a recumbent nude by
Goya. The lady was popularly (but quite
erroneously) supposed by a group of
junior philatelists of my acquaintance to
be the Queen of Spain.

“Ray Whiting”: Our battery included
a bloke with a puritanical dial who
abhorred the grog and never missed a
church parade. When he got back one
night from the Wog village with a skinful
of local brandy and screaming a bawdy
pastoral about a milkmaid and a jackeroo
we were intrigued. He opened up and
explained that this was the happiest day
of his life. He’d had a letter from his
wife telling him that he was a waster
and that she never wanted to see him
again. She’d had an anonymous letter
from Syria telling of his shocking benders
“Can't understand how Maggie used to get ’em so snow-white .”
on arrack and how he divided his time
between going a.w.l. and doubling around
inside the Jerusalem boob—.when he
wasn’t romping with a half-French bint
at the out-of-bounds village of Zgorta.
The reason for his rejoicing was that he
had had a brainwave and it had brought
results; he had written the anonymous
libel himself on the orderly-room type-
writer.
“Eureka”: “W.D.” (B. 15/9/’4B) would
be hard put to it to get a descendant of
the Explorers’ Tree; it has been nothing
but a dead stump for many years. It
would be just as impossible to get a
young shoot or seed from many of the
other historic trees in Australia. Still,
there are some splendid examples of
tree-planting here. At Faulconbridge, on
the Blue Mountains, there is a Prime
Ministers’ Avenue, where a tree has been
planted by (or for) every Australian
Prime Minister; in Parramatta Park is
a Governors’ Avenue along similar lines ;
at Anzac Rifle Range, Liverpool (N.S.W.),
is an avenue of trees in memory of rifle-
club men who died during the First
World War. Similar avenues are to be
seen at Orange, Ballarat and in many
other towns. Most unique tree in this
country must be the Mons tree in the
Sydney Botanical Gardens. It is actually
growing in foreign soil. The tree was
planted by the squires of Mons in soil
gathered from the graves of British
soldiers who fell in the memorable battle,
the soil being sent out here by the Burgo-
master.

“Waddlin’ Willie”: Lord Howe Island,
scene of last month’s tragic Catalina
crash, played an important role in the
training of flying-boat crews during the
war. Before a Gat. crew was accepted
by the Rathmines Operational Training
School it was given a final test —“Navk
gate the open sea to Lord Howe, alight
and return.” Sounds easy on paper. But
for a group of young airmen, itching
for operational flying, it was hard work.
Aircrew observers still recall the proud
moment when, after navigating the 500
miles across the drink, dropping heaps of
sea-markers to check drift and receiving
radio-bearings every 15 minutes, they saw
the precipitous cliffs of Lord Howe.
Nine months later, back from an opera-
tional tour, the Lord Howe trip was
child’s play.

“Ceg”: I know a Collins-street surgeon
who would read “Hamfat’s” par. on
memory-aids with considerable interest.
In his student days, like “Hamfat’s”
actor, he devised a system whereby some
of the more troublesome text-book pas-
sages would be regularly under his notice.
The system worked like this; His alarm-
clock woke him in the early morning and
he was immediately confronted by a few
choice lines concerning the liver pasted
on the dial of the clock. Pinned on a
chair near his dressing-gown would be
some interesting notes on the spleen. The
bath-towel would carry some message
about the heart, and pinned on his shav-
ing-mirror would be a short treatise on
some gland or other. And so it went on
through the day. He told me it really
helped. He passed his exams., so perhaps
it did.
* * ♦ *
“Jasby”: Looking back to my cigarette-
card collecting days I can recall most of
the sets mentioned by “Smilo” (B.
6/10/’4B) and many more besides —-
colored pictures of events in British
history, portraits of V.C.-winners, famous
sporting figures, illustrated riddles and
photographs of battle-scenes of the First
World War. But the gem of my collec-
tion was a set of stereoscopic views of
the world. I fancy they were put out by
the Vice-Regal cigarette people, from
whom could also be obtained a small
stereoscope which folded up and fitted
into a small tin box about the size of a
rubber-stamp pad. My set disappeared
years ago, but I recalled it recently when
seeing- the film “Life With Father.”
Montage of the picture made use of old
stereoscopic photos, and I’ll swear I
recognised one or two of them as being
included in my miniature set of long ago.

“Mac Hoots”: It is not my intention to
write a serial on the gateposts in Sydney
Botanical Gardens which have been hor-
ribly renovated for the Royal visit (B.
6/10/’4B), but I think I should add that
a "distant view of scaffolding on Govern-
ment House, and an awful suspicion,
-tempted me to explore further. I can
say no more. Except that I trust his
Majesty will not be knocked flat on his
back, as I was, by the blinding glare of
acres of raw sandstone, scrubbed, chipped,
scraped, and now, as a piece of Sydney
architecture, so incomparably vulgar that
one sighs for the quiet dignity of Dar-
linghurst Jail.

“Ike Hollar”,: Whatever happens in re-
gard to thq claim of an 18-year-old youth
in Denmark that he is the Lindbergh
baby for whose murder Hauptmann was
hanged, a new mystery for debate is
bound to be added to the long list which
is headed by the Man in the Iron Mask
and the Marie Celeste affair. If the
young man’s claim is recognised there
will be those who will talk of clever im-
posture ; if not, others will champion just
rights denied to him. Only the other
day I had to listen, during a long tram-
journey, to the outpourings of a fanatic
who insisted that Kitchener had been the
man behind the organisation of the Nazi
Army. It was impossible to stop him
with argument that his idea was un-
reasonable and that K. of K. must have
been a mighty old man for his Nazi job;
he dismissed* the report of the drowning
of Kitchener as a fake to cover the
defection of the British military leader—
always, he maintained, a German sym-
pathiser. I recall that in 1916 many
people would not believe in Kitchener’s
death; the most popular story then was
that he was secretly organising the
Russian steamroller. History is cluttered
with characters who, according to faith-
ful followers, did not die on the occa-
sions officially chronicled; a loyal
stand-in, for example, took the place of
Charles I and lost his head for the King.
And there have been scores of similar
yarns.
* * ♦ ♦
“Taswegian”: My wife and I went by
train from Perth to Albany, then along
the coast through Denmark to Nornalup.
We wanted to go from there to Manji-'
mup, 80-odd miles by road, so that we ;
could travel back to Perth on the coast-
line, through Bunbury. The only trans-
port available was a covered-in truck,
taking cream to a butter-factory. We ,
took it. It was a terrible road, its sur-
face like corrugated-iron. In the closed- '
in back the cream-cans jolted about with
a noise like heavy gunfire. But it was a
lovely day, and the road went through
wonderful forests of karri and jarrah,
with now and then, as the truck climbed
a hill, a striking panorama of rugged
coast and blue ocean. So my wife said,
anyway. I wouldn’t know ; I was in
the closed-in back, with the cream-cans.
* * * *
“Sixenate”: To a police-court Solomon
who required an interpretation of the
word “spieler” a detective-sergeant gave a
long explanation ; but since he used terms
like “magsman,” “roller-sweat” and “over
and under” a Beak who professed to be
so innocent of the knowledge of slang
must have been puzzled anew. A much
simpler definition could have been given.
Yiddish has given the language the word
“spiel,” which is simply any nefarious
method of making money; and a spieler
is one who uses some such method. Most
particularly the term is applied to the
confidence-man.

“Search”: Those oil slicks (B. 15/9/’4S)
were seen towards evening when the light
over the sea is notoriously uncertain;
even at high noon it takes an expert to
distinguish an oil slick from a tide-mark,
under certain conditions. Sometimes, too,
over a bed of giant kelp there is a semi-
permanent oil slick, caused by oil from
the kelp stems. It doesn’t show up at all
in rough weather, but in calm it is notice-
able from the sea, more so from the air,
and has deceived plenty of expert pilots.
* * * *
“Nubis”: When I first came to the
suburb I was baffled by the methods of
the postman. Whenever he whistled at
my place I rushed oiit. to the letter-box
and invariably came back empty-handed.
If he whistled just before reaching me,
or just afterwards, there was always a
letter. He always whistles half-way
between two points of call, thereby
saving one blow for every two houses
visited. Consequently, if he blows at my
place he has a letter for Mr. Smith on my
left and another for Mr. Brown on my
right, whereas if he blows at Mr. Brown’s
place he has one for me and another for
Mr. Jones on Mr, Brown’s left. I haven’t
worked out yet whether he’s afraid of
wearing out his whistle or whether it’s
just breath he’s saving.
* * * *
“Bo”: The Hereford (Eng.) clergyman
who the other day held a special service
for his congregation’s pets was beaten to
the idea years ago by our vicar—and in
the humble capacity of pew-opener’s
laborer I was co-opted to assist. A man of
rather strange taste in pets, he started the
service with a football-guernsey goanna
maintaining a clawhold on his sparse
thatch, while he gently ruffled the quills
of a fretful porcupine he was holding.
Shortly after the Doxology there came a
shriek from a back pew, but all that had
happened was that Sid Larkins’s pet car-
pet-snake, the best mouser in the district,
had engulfed old Miss Flint’s miniature
Peke, masticated the lead and was up as
far as the elbow of the arm holding it.
The service was temporarily held up
while disciplinary measures were taken
against young Ronny Seddon, who’d
been extracting bloated bottle-ticks from
his pet bandicoot and was firing them
with a catapult at the vicar. Immediately
after Joe Nash’s parrot had sidled up
against the porcupine, which the vicar
had put down, there arose a fluent flow
of bush Australianese that kept going
right up to the collection. It was shortly
after this that I looked up from a pensive
study of a frilled lizard in the aisle to
find that everyone else in the congrega-
tion had vanished. The vicar, however,
was still unconcernedly reading Paul’s
Epistle to the Corinthians. Springing to
it, I unsuccessfully endeavored to rescue
the last ten-bob note from going down
the ample gullet of Stinker Murphy’s
big billygoat, which had muscled the in-
digestible browns and treybits aside and
was then starting on the green baize of
the collection plate. It wasn’t until later
that I learnt that our vicar was totally
bereft of the sense of smell.
BY ANY MEANS.
“Mr. Ward said that, whatever might be the de-
cision of the Privy Council, once Labor had spoken
and said that the banks must be nationalised the
issue was beyond doubt.”
A statement to recall, it’s worth a note,
Those lines which Pope sardonically wrote:
“Get place and wealth —if possible with grace;
If not, by any means get wealth and place.”
A bit of guidance with which Eddie Ward
Proclaims himself in absolute accord.
“Get what you’re after,” he adjures his clan,
“If not with grace, just anyhow you can.”
Banks must be socialised, he’d have you know.
Why? Because Labor has ordained it so.
And anyone who dares to question that
Must, he infers, be talking through his hat.
What other crowd but his can fill the bill
As clear exponents of the people’s will?
A sentiment that’s safe to be encored
Among the hustings fans of Eddie Ward.
Banks must be grabbed, he tells you square and
straight.
If methods lawful and legitimate
Should prove resultless, next, one may suppose,
Modes must be tried more devious than those.
A curious pronouncement to be made
By those whose mission’s to see laws obeyed,
Yet, should decisions go against them, hope
To utilise the formula of Pope.
Banks are our meat, and juicy tucker, too,
Seems the prevailing Socialistic view.
And should unsympathetic courts of law
Withhold such joints from that capacious maw,
Should judges these contentions disallow,
We’ve Ward’s assurance that, somewhen, some-
how,
Ways will be found to give the blockers beans
And bring the bacon home “by any means.”

T. THE R.


“Rottney Kid”: It says something for
the extent of gambling in Australia
when the S.A. Betting Control Board can
inform the S.A. Government that book-
makers handled £17,000,000 in bets at
S.A. metropolitan race-meetings in the
year ended 30/6/’4B. South Australia has
only about a twelfth of the Common-
wealth’s total population, and it doesn’t
possess a State lottery. The amount
was million more than the previous
year, and the board puts this down to the
40-hour week, greater leisure and higher
wages. In 1946-47 the average bet was
235. Id.; last year it was 255. 2d.; 14
years ago it was 17s. 2d. During 1947-48 a
total of 14,000,000 bets was recorded, an
average of 20 bets for every man, woman
and child in the State. Since a very large
proportion of them don’t bet at all, bet
sporadically or bet only in small amounts,
the whole thing strongly suggests that
higher wages and shorter hours are
merely a benefit for the bookies —and, in
view of the growing liquor consumption,
for the pubs. This may read like a
Jeremiad, but I’m dashed if I can be
cheerful about it.

“Becks”; Commenting on the disabili-

“Cauboy” (B. 6/10/’4B) remarks “But a

who paints the pictures that carry off

“X.S.”; To test their Creative imagina-
tion teachers in my day used to ask their
charges to write essays on a penny or
some such entrancing subject. None of
us thought of any fiction to equal this
touch of real life in Melbourne, Walking
along Elizabeth-street with his mother a
four-year-oldster picked up a ha’penny,
announcing his find with great relish.
“You’d better give it to me to keep it for
you,” said his mother, “I swallowed it,”
said the infant. The terrified mother
summoned an ambulance and had the
patient conveyed to the Children’s Hos-
pital, where an X-ray confirmed the
youngster’s story. The coin at the time
of writing is flying across Bass Strait to
Launceston, where by the ordinary
process of nature it is expected to return
to circulation.

“Bohemian”: Six years ago an Auck-
land man entered a homing-pigeon in a
race from Wellington. The bird never
turned up, and his owner assumed he was
lost, or that some other fancier had got
hold of him and kept him for breeding
purposes. A few weeks ago the owner,
who had practically forgotten the in-
cident, was annoyed by a strange pigeon
that insisted on taking up quarters in his
loft, to the annoyance of the other
pigeons. He drove him away repeatedly,
but the bird returned again and again.
Examined, he proved to be the long-lost
bird ; on his leg was the ring of identifi-
cation. Birds have been known to return
after one season, but pigeon-fanciers say
this is the first time a bird has returned
after such a long period. A M.L.
naturalist says he has no doubt that the
pigeon went native. Birds who go native
rarely come back, but a bad food season
this year probably sent this one in desper-
ation to seek his old haunts.

“L.P.”: Prefab, houses from England
(B. 22/9/’4B) are as old as the first settle-
ment. The first —a canvas-and-wood
structure—was assembled at Port Jackson
in 1788, its occupant Governor Phillip. In
the years that followed many settlers
brought their houses out with them, some
to find that it was cheaper and easier to
build from the natural resources of the
Australian bush than to cart their prefabs
for miles over trackless country. As a
Mr. Cotton put it in a letter he wrote
from Port Phillip in July, 1843, to, a
friend in England: “You will naturally
wish to know what I intend to do with
the house X brought out with me. I
scarcely know, I was wrong in bringing
it. It is impossible to convey it up to the
"It's no good, Hollis; well have to get another greenkeeper."
Goulburn, and as bricks are so cheap now
at Melbourne, I find that I cannot dispose
of it.” It’s a different tale today,

“R.8.T.”: Another celebrity who
was interred without his head (B.

Joaquin Murietta, who, together with one
of his lieutenants, Three-Fingered Jack,
was killed in 1853. Joaquin’s head and
Three-Fingered Jack’s hand were pre-
served in alcohol, and for many years
were on exhibition at Natchez’s Arms
Store and Pistol Gallery in San Francisco,
Both exhibits are believed to have been
destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake
and fire.

“J.C.P.”: In a desert station the
troops had been lectured on the new
enemy land-mine which had a trigger
mechanism operating as the unwary
one’s foot was lifted. Raff, walking on
the sand with his mate, felt his foot sink.
Freezing into immobility, he asked his
jeering pal, “What do you do when
you stand on one of those land-mines?”
His mate collected a mob, who shouted
advice from a safe distanpe. Eventually
Raff dived sideways; nothing happened.
Careful excavation brought to light a

“W.M.”: It is doubtful whether the
Explorers’ Tree (B. 15/9/’4B) does bear
the original marking. Evans states in his
journal that on January 3, 1814, on his
return from Bathurst Plains, a bushfire
came up from the valley, travelled ahead
of his party down towards Springwood,
destroying the tree-blazings. He “re-
stored” the markings. Whitley has a
whole volume on the subject in the
“That will be all. Meadows—just kiss my wife good-night for me."
Mitchell Library. Evans also mentions a
“marked tree” at Lowther Creek. An-
other point: No convict died on Cox’s
trip. Cox picked “well-inclined hardy
men who had been some years in the
colony and accustomed to field labor”
and so “better enabled to stand six or
twelve months’ hard work in the moun-
tains than those who had been house
servants or accustomed to light labor,”
One man did die at Martin’s on the
Nepean—Sergeant of the Guard Baunds
or Bounds. Cox “sent a soldier to Wind-
sor to the Sergeant there for him to send
out a coffin and attend himself with a
party to bury the corps [sic] at Castle-
reagh” and then wrote to Governor Mac-
quarie for another sergeant. The graves
in that other cemetery represent later
deaths.
“Ex-C.G.”: Dunno about testing
people’s honesty by displaying boodle
before them in the raw (B. 29/9/’4B), but
we once tested mass-observation in Mel-
bourne by crumpling up eight or nine £1
notes in a loose bundle, tying them with
a bit of tape and, remaining in strategic
positions for possible developments,
casually dropped them in Bourke-street
47 yards above the main entrance to the
Royal Mail pub. That was at approxi-
mately 5.10 on a Friday afternoon in
summer in the old days when Friday was
Melbourne’s big day. At 5.55 we re*
trieved the bundle from where it had
been kicked by some careless toe into the
gutter and just beat the gong into the
R.M. bar, convinced that the old Biblical
cove knew what he spoke of when he
mentioned those “who have eyes yet see
not.”

“Cy Cyclone”: New York’s Jubilee
celebrations (B. 8/9/’48): If the star that
gave the light that started the works that
cut the ribbon that opened the show is
only 300 million miles away the light-
wave must have begun its journey slightly
less than 27 minutes previously—not 50
years. The equivalent of 50 light-years is
293 billion miles, or nearly a million times
the distance “Col M.” attributes to the
star Alioth. Incidentally, the nearest star
outside our solar system is about 20
billion miles, or over three light-years
away. Some are many millions of light-
years distant.

“Clooter”: Ever since there have been
railway lines in the vicinity of small boys
the experiment of placing stones upon
the lines has continued. As one who has
not been guiltless of the experiment
I wish to announce that seldom
is the intent to wreck the train—
the idea is (a) to enjoy the sadistic
pleasure of seeing the stone crushed to
powder or (b) to discover which will win,
the train or the stones. A rail-motor
driver on the Darling Downs saw stones
on the rails the other day, slowed down
and allowed his wheels to push
them off. He was outraged to discover
more on the return trip at the same spot,
and reported it. A policeman went out
straight away. Stones were back on the
line. After that the route was patrolled.
All this could have been avoided if the
driver had resolutely crushed the stones
in the first place, but since no. responsible
person would expect him to risk his pas-
sengers’ lives by so doing, the obvious
remedy seems to be the setting-up by the
various railway departments of special
stone-crushing engines to precede all
trains. Hang it all, the kids might have
wanted small shot for their shanghais,

“The Ghoul”: “H.D.P.’s” corpse (B.
15/9/’4B) reminds me of another cadaver
which was fished out of the Yarra. A
wealthy woman whose husband had been
missing for some time went to the morgue'
to see if it were he. She was almost con-
vinced it was until, just before leaving the
chamber of horrors, she put her finger
on or near the corpse’s mouth, causing the
bottom lip to droop sufficiently enough
to show a gold tooth —an adornment her
husband did not possess. Recoiling, she
addressed the corpse thus; “You darned
fool; you’d have had the best funeral in
Melbourne if you’d only kept your mouth
shut!”

“S.S.”; The new kid in our neighbor-
hood brought with him one of those flash
toy jeeps, with which he proceeded to
chase off any billycart he could find.
His delight was great when he was able
to smash or capsize one. However, a
local young ’un had an idea, and one
day let his billycart flat-out down the hill
straight for the up-coming smarty in his
jeep. “Look out,” cried the kid in the
jeep. “This is a jeep—zzz—zzzzz.” “You
look out for me,” said the local stalwart.
“I’m a Churchill tank—bang, bang.” Jeep
tried to steer off, but Billycart tracked
him remorselessly and, just before the
moment of impact, he leapt out. The
crash brought feminine heads to near-by
windows. The jeep had been badly muti-
lated ; the owner of the billycart had
packed his vehicle tight with bricks, and
its striking-force must have been terrific.
“B. A. Ker”; The tram was not ex-
cessively crowded —for a Sydney tram.
At least you could see the people in the
seats opposite. But the couple in the
corner were too wrapped up in each
other to stare at anybody else. Just as
the vehicle was jarring to a stop an elderly
lady leaned across, tapped the young chap
on the shoulder with her walking-
stick and said rather tartly: “Young
man, I wish to get out here. Could you
stop cuddling your young lady long
enough to assist me to alight?” The
young fellow flushed. “Certainly I’ll help
you out.” His tone was polite, though
loaded with hurt dignity, “But I was not
cuddling my young lady.” Not until
she was safely, on the road did the old
nark reply; “Not with your arms, piaybe,
but, young man, you were positively
mauling her with your eyes.” The
“mauler” joined in the laugh.

“The Showman”: An old mariner like
“Salt Junk Joe” (B. 6/10/’4B) must have
passed Naturaliste and rounded the
Leeuwin many a time, so I’m rather sur-
prised that he doesn’t know the winds
that howl across that corner as the Roar-
ing Forties—what does he call them, any-
way? My only authority for so naming
them was several years spent in those
parts, but, since the matter is in dispute,
I must call in some authoritative support.
Longmans’ School Geography for a
primer:
In the southern hemisphere there is little
land beyond 40deg. S., and hence the anti-
trades blow there with more constancy,
and are known to seamen, from the latitudes
in which they prevail, as “the Roaring
Forties.”
As to their moving north and south, here
is the Commonwealth Year-Book ;
During the summer months the pre-
vailing westerly winds retreat a consider-
able distance to the south of Australia....
when the sun passes to the north of the
equator they sweep across the southern
area of the continent from the Leeuwin to
Cape Howe.
A. P. Beckinsale, M.A., in his Land, Air
and Ocean, also refers to “The Roaring
Forties, the winds of the westerly belt in
the Southern Hemisphere..,. ”, while
Griffith Taylor, D.Sc., B.E. (Sydney),
B. (Cantab.), F.R.G.S. and F.R.S., who
was, among other things, Physiographer
in the Commonwealth Weather Service in
1910, says, in his Australia, Physiographic
and Economic : —
In the south of Australia the rainfall
occurs six months later (June-August), when
the whole wind-circulation of the globe
swings north in accord with the sun. For
this reason the constant westerlies, which
—as their name “Roaring Forties” implies—
usually blow considerably south of Aus-
tralia, during the colder months blow across
the south-west corner of Australia and
across Victoria.
I’ll make a sporting proposition: If the
lighthouse-keeper on Naturaliste doesn’t
know the winter gales there as the Roar-
ing Forties I’ll buy “Salt Junk Joe”
enough grog to slake what must be a
terrible thirst.
IN PRAGUE.
“A bill is being put through the Czechoslovak
parliament which makes practically any form of
opposition to the Communist Government a crime,
punishable by imprisonment.”— Cable.
A measure that will stand for no defying,
Set out in terms to scare away dissent.
Quick movers, Communists, there’s no denying,
an featuring the aims whereon they’re bent,
Abbreviating, too, and simplifying
The usual processes of Parliament
By warnings that henceforth at any time
Daring to differ from them is a crime.
Bills will require, I take it, no debating.
Once framed, they’ll be enacted on the nail;
All schemes of even mildly agitating
Against their passage will be like to fail
When anybody heard asseverating
They need amendments will be lodged in jail
To expiate in an unpleasant way
His dire offence against lese majeste.
Can you imagine in your wildest vision
A Parliament devoid of storm and stress,
Of thrust and parry, wordy disquisition
And brisk exchanges of cantankerousness;
One where the function of the Opposition,
Far from opposing, is to acquiesce
Meekly in everything suggested by
The Government? You can’t? No more can I.
Well, though it means your old ideas deleting.
Scrapping all previous impressions, you’ll
Have possibly a chance to give it greeting
Sooner or later where the Commos rule,
A House as sombre as a Quakers’ meeting,
As well-conducted as a Sunday school.
Yet, noting how it’s gained, I feel a vague
Doubt of its efficacy—ev’n in Prague.

W. A. Bartlett, who came from England
as g.m. in 1935 and succeeded W. A. Watt
as chairman in 1946, died shortly after
the close of accounts in 1947, He has
been followed by Sir Alexander Stewart
at the head of the board table, and by
Professor R. R. Blackwood, Dean of the
Faculty of Engineering, Melbourne Uni.,
as g.m. Mr. Blackwood had previously
served the co. for 14 years, most of them
as technical manager.
The Dunlop organisation—parent and
eight subsidiaries —is the biggest thing of
its kind in the southern hemisphere.
There is £4,695,655 of share capital
(930,000 10 p.c. prefs. and 3,765,655
ords.) supported and assisted by £771,043
of reserves, after deducting intangibles
(£732,660). The parent has £2,279,645
invested in subsidiaries, of which several
have not yet had time to develop full
earning-power, but all are reported to be
making good progress. Output covers
a wide range of rubber and rubberised
products, as well as plastics, wet batteries
and tennis-strings and racquets. And
research is constantly expanding market
scope.
Except in a few minor lines, demand
is still running ahead of production, which
is below plant capacity owing to short-
age of labor and some raw materials,
chiefly cotton and rayon tyre-cords. On
the fuel side a substantial switch from
coal to oil has done much to ensure
continuity of production, to the benefit
of unit costs. At end June last there
were 592,512 cars and 414,175 com-
mercial vehicles registered in Australia,
an increase of 5.4 p.c. and 60.5 p.c. re-
spectively on the 1939 figures. Tractor
tyres and industrial rubber goods were
also a feature of last term’s turnover,
which reached the record figure of
£7,553,000, Coupled with increased effi-
ciency in production and good buying,
this helped to offset the effects of a 31
p.c. increase in direct labor costs, -owing
to wage-lifts and the 40-hour week, and
rise in price of raw materials, mainly
raw rubber, up 38 p.c. over the twelve-
month.
After setting aside £210,343 (up
£29,951) for depreciation, allowing an un-
specified amount for taxation and deduct-
ing the interest of outside shareholders
(£13,182), aggregate net earnings of the
group were £22,810 stronger at £534,745
—best since 1929, when the Perdriau and
Barnet Glass businesses were taken over.
It covered the pref. div. and 11.6 p.c. on
ord. capital as against 11.3 p.c. for the
previous year. Profit claimed by the
parent alone was £535,814 (up £25,984).
Purchase of scrip in subsidiaries during
the year included £32,184 for share
premiums, which was charged direct to
reserves. The div., steady at 5 p.c. for
the five years to mid-1946, was kept at
8 p.c., leaving £140,493 (26.2 p.c. of the
year’s profit) to plough back into the
business.
Although costs remain on a steep up-
grade, the immediate sales outlook is
bright enough. Three new factories are
going up in Victoria (Bendigo, Bairns-
dale and Frankston) and two in N. S.
Wales (Bankstown and St. Mary’s). This
should mean a net gain in labor, better
output of tyres and industrial rubber
goods at the two main factories —Mon-
tague (Vic.) and Drummoyne (N.S.W-) —
and increased total production. Prospects
for the subsidiaries are encouraging, too.
As a hedge against dollar and other
shortages, rising prices, delays in de-
liveries and disturbed conditions in
Malaya, the co. was carrying an extra
£906,722 of stocks at June 30 —they in-
cluded six months’ supply of raw rubber
bought at “advantageous prices”:

The net growth in fixed assets was
£372,651, book debts £226,808 and in-
vestments, etc.,' £54,605. To meet the
outlay the board drew upon the big cash
holding, etc,, for £1,110,438, reducing it
to £4163, and went outside for an extra
£285,798. On balance the more-or-less
liquid surplus (£3,500,687) was down
£264,082, owing to additions to fixed
assets. A lot of new plant is to be in-
stalled during the current term, and unit
costs should benefit, but no hint is given
that shareholders might be asked to assist.

When the Yarra Falls-A.K.M. textile
group dissolved in 1939 A.K.M. returned
seven-eighths (£343,750) of its capital,
partly in Yarra Falls and Austral Silk
scrip and partly in cash. That reduced
the figure to £206,250 in 10,000 1\ p.c.
prefs. —they advance with the ords. be-
yond that rate and share in surplus assets
—and 540,000 ords., all f.-p. to 7s. 6d.
each. Trade remained keenly competi-
tive, and for the next three years the ords.
got a regular 1\ p.c. Then came war,
and with it altered trading conditions,
followed by a post-war boom, the child
of war-time inflation, scarcities and pres-
sure of spending power which have
exerted a steady upward pressure on
prices and costs.
Thus, for the last nine years the co.,
as well as other traders, has enjoyed a
sellers’ market, and shareholders have re-
ceived a steady all-round 10 p.c. At the
same time additions have been made to
freehold and plant and paid for largely
out of earnings, and reserves have been
substantially strengthened. At end July
last they totalled £271,478, after deduct-
ing goodwill (£25,000), or £65,228 more
than paid capital. The two combined,
therefore, need net only 4.3 p.c. to cover
10 p.c. on capital alone. The branch fac-
tory set up at Hamilton (Vic.) a couple
of years ago to help overcome the labor
problem is giving good account of itself,
and plans for its enlargement are in hand.
Plant, reported in good condition, is
being modernised as up-to-date equip-
ment becomes available, and new cotton-
and worsted-spinning sections are being
added, thus making the mills independent
of outside supplies of these classes of
yarn. It all augurs well for the co.’s
future competitive power, and makes the
10 p.c. div. look as comfortable as any-
thing of the kind can look in this class of
business during these risky and uncertain
times.
The co. markets its factory products
under four Fleece”
pure wool underwear, “Kookaburra”
wool-and-cotton underwear, “A.K.M.”
cotton under- and sports-wear and
“Golden Ray” hosiery. To date produc-
tion rather than sales has been the prob-
lem, Chief bottlenecks have been labor,
especially female, and tops and yarns.
Last term turnover was a record, thanks
partly to help from the Hamilton fac-
tory. The net result stepped up £6295,
reaching £39,142, best since 1936. It was
equal to 18.9 p.c. on capital (pref. and
ord. combined) as against 15.9, 10.2, 13.6,
16.1, 14.1, 13.7 and 14 p.c, back to 1941.
The figure was written after allowing
£25,331 (£8867) for depreciation and
£29,000 (up £2900) for taxation, but
leaves out of the reckoning £3049 of wage
subsidies recovered in respect of 1946 and
1947 and sent direct to reserves. Judged
according to old standards, the allow-
ance for depreciation might appear
generous, but in the much-altered circum-
stances of today it amounts to no more
than ordinary commercial prudence.
Arrival of part of the new spinning
plant, provision for housing it and pur-

The growth of £74,389 in stocks and

trading. To meet the year’s outlay the
board drew upon cash, etc., for £28,427
and went outside for an extra £96,922.
Additions to fixed assets reduced the
more or less liquid surplus (£209,083) by
£18,304.

Electrice refrigeration and other domestic
appliances and Philco radio, and returns
from a wad of investments outside the
business.
The 12 months covered by the latest
accounts was one of the best in the co.’s
history—only once (in 1926, when the
figure reached £69,606) was a better profit
shown. An all-round and marked in-
crease in sales lifted turnover beyond the
million-pound mark. Helpful factors
were expanding trade activity, high level
of earnings generally, and large deferred
demand, which, together with current
needs, pressed heavily upon delayed pro-
duction and delivery of vehicles, etc.
Competition was reduced to a minimum
and so was the sales effort needed to turn
stocks into cash. Smaller provision for
taxation (£39,000, down £14,000) helped
to further increase the final figure.
The improvement in gross earnings
(£308,265) was £52,981, of which exes.
(£248,919, including tax provision) took
£33,369. That left the net result £19,612
stronger at £59,346, or a juicy 42.6 p.c.
on capital as against 28.5, 28.6, 27.4, 18.4,
16.1 and 8.6 p.c. back to 1942, when war
had reduced activity in the motor trade
to a trickle. The cautious board kept the
div. at 16 p.c., of which 6 p.c, is labelled
“special dividend.”
Certainly present boom conditions
cannot be expected to continue indefi-
nitely, earnings in the motor trade are
sensitive to fluctuations in economic con-
ditions, and there will presently be com-
petition from G.M.-H.’s new all-Aus-
tralian car. Some recession from last
term’s Jiigh level of earnings is therefore
to be expected. The immediate outlook,
however, is still one of buoyant trade
activity, and the domestic-appliances
side of the business is shaping well. Also,
the £139,093 of capital has the support
and assistance of £251,150 of reserves.
So the two combined need turn in only
5.7 p.c. to show 16 p.c. on capital alone,
or 3.5 p.c. to cover a 10 p.c. div.
Doubtful as to how long the 16 p.c.
div. will be maintained, the market prices
the f.-p. pound shares, covered by 48s.
Id. in net tangibles, at 495. or thereabouts.
The return at 495. is 6.5 p.c. on the basis
of last year’s distribution, or a satisfac-
tory 4 p.c. should the div. drop to 10 p.c.

are believed to be well worth their book-

The year’s increase of £113,964 in stocks
is partly a hedge against delays in de-
livery and rising prices. How much of
the blanket item (up £52,780) represents
book debts and how much investments
outside the business (shares in other cos.
and Government securities) it is impos-
sible to say from the published figures.
In 1942, when book debts were light, the
item totalled £161,348. To meet the
year’s net growth of £113,579 in total
assets only £58,084 was added to the
amount coming to sundry creditors.

The British Labour Minister, in intro-
ducing the “1946 Assurance Companies
Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”:—
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance.”
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention»of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and as business of an international
character.

Metal Prices
London (sterling) prices for
lead, zinc and copper are up

both here and in London, have
reacted. The metal quotations:

The lift, which operated as from
October 1, was not altogether
unexpected. With the London
Metal Exchange still closed,
conditions in U.S. set the world
price for primary metals, and
have done so since the war
ended. There, with a strong in-
dustrial demand running ahead
of domestic mine production,
and continued inflation and pur-
chases on account of the strategic
stockpile, market sentiment is
all one way for the present. The
New York price of lead rose
from 15 cents to 17.5 cents a
pound in April and to 19.5 cents
in July, when the figure for zinc
went from 17.5 cents to 19.5
cents a pound, and for electro-
lytic copper from 21.875 cents
to 23.5 cents a pound. The
recent sterling adjustment brings
the two markets into line, allow-
ing for freight and insurance
adjustments. That the U.K. lead
price was not raised sooner was
because British buying .arrange-
ments for lead —Australia is the
main supplier—are on a different
basis from" those of zinc and
copper.
The anomalous position that
exists between Australian fixed
prices and world market value
of metals as expressed by Lon-
don quotations is shown in the
following table:

The Federal Government has
exploited Australia’s strong posi-
tion as a lead and zinc pro-
ducer by keeping the control-
screw at the discriminating
£A22-a-ton level for each of
these metals. That is substan-
tially below current cost of
production, level of which
is still rising. It is plain,
therefore, that exports provide
the dividends paid by Aus-
tralia’s big lead and zinc pro-
ducers, while local consumers
get both metals at an artificial
and very low figure. A little
over three-quarters of the lead
produced by the Barrier cos. and
about 52 p.c. of the zinc turned
out at Risdon are exported. Mt.
Isa sells the whole of its silver-
lead bullion and zinc concen-
trates overseas. The whole
question of local metal prices
and allocation of metal outputs
is long overdue for review.
AUSTRALIAN PAPER MANUFACTURERS LTD.
ANNUAL MEETING
Chairman’s Address
During the course of his address at the Annual Meeting of Australian Paper
Manufacturers Limited, held in Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Building,
O’Connell Street, Sydney, at 3 p.m., Thursday, September 30th, the Chairman
of Directors, Sir Norman Brookes, said:
“A feature of the post-war period
throughout the world has been rapidly
rising prices. In Australia we have
been relatively fortunate and price
increases have been rather less violent
than in countries such as the U.S.A.
Nevertheless, an alarming acceleration
in the rate of price increase has
occurred in Australia over the past
twelve months and it behoves every
one of us, be he in the sphere of
Government Service or private enter-
prise, firstly to use every weapon in
our armory to fight against this seri-
ous menace to our future stability
by striving for the utmost efficiency,
and secondly to take every possible
provident step to mitigate the effect
of such price increases on the ulti-
mate soundness of each branch of
industry for, as far as it is humanly
possible, we must aim to protect the
long-term soundness of our enter-
prises.
“Time will not permit a full survey
but, as to my first urge, I do feel
that, following the transfer of price
control to the States, the elimination
of many subsidies, the decision to
decontrol many industries forthwith
and others as rapidly as possible—
there is a responsibility thrown on
the shoulders of leaders of industry.
At all times industry has a' major
responsibility not only to its em-
ployees and shareholders but also to
its customers and to the nation. More
than ever is this so today and now
is the time and the opportunity for
private industry to demonstrate its
breadth of outlook and its sense of
fairness and to aim at improved
efficiency.
“As to my second point—the miti-
gating of the ill effect of inevitable
price or cost increases, I have in
mind the need, among other things,
for industries to examine their re-
serves and the basis on which future
reserves are created. I speak of
reserves for all purposes including,
perhaps particularly, obsolescence and
depreciation provisions. Figures will
best explain my thoughts. The net
figure of £2,881,407 appears in the
Balance Sheet before you against
the item “Fixed Assets,” and, it will
be seen, this is after a total provision
for Depreciation, Amortisation and
Obsolescence of £3,498,528 has been
made over the years. To replace
these “Fixed Assets” would cost to-
day well over ten million pounds.
On the one hand we. have the very
conservative position that our Fixed
Assets in terms of today’s values for
equivalent capacity are nearly four
times greater than appears on the
Balance Sheet. On the other hand
your Directors must ask themselves
whether the provision of £3,498,000
for depreciation, etc., based largely on
the pre-war basis adopted by your
Company, is adequate in the light of
today’s changed and changing values.
At the moment we believe that this
is adequate, but the position must be
reviewed constantly.
“I commend the foregoing thoughts
to you.
MERGER OF HORDING
COMPANIES:
“You were informed in addresses
by my predecessor at Annual Meet-
ings about the time of the outbreak
of war of the active consideration
being given by your Board in con-
junction with the Boards of the two
holding Companies—the Australasian
Paper and Pulp Co., Ltd., and Cum-
berland Paper Board Mills, Ltd. —to
the very desirable simplification of
the financial structure of the A.P.M.
Group. The development of the war
made it impossible to proceed at that
stage.
“The hindrance to expansion both
industrially and financially following
the end of the war became more and
more apparent, with the result that
discussions were again initiated early
this year between the Boards of the
various Companies. The outcome
was the execution on July 15 last of
a merger agreement between the twb
holding Companies under which the
Australasian Paper and Pulp Co.,
Ltd., will acquire the whole of the
issued shares, both preference and
ordinary, in Cumberland Paper Board
Mills, Ltd.
“Your Board has been very pleased
to learn that some 95 per cent, of
each class of Cumberland shareholder
has assented to the proposal. Little
more than formalities, now remain.
“Your Directors believe that this
merger has been carried out on a
basis which is eminently satisfactory
to all shareholders in the three Com-
panies constituting the group and
that the simplification thus provided,
in which A.P.P. will be the sole holder
of all ordinary shares in A.P.M., will
do much to facilitate and simplify
our programme of expansion.
“May I at this stage acknowledge
the appreciation that my Board has
of the helpful manner in which Mr.
Anderson and Mr. Norris, the re-
tiring Chairman and Director of Cum-
berland, have conducted the negotia-
tions leading to the consummation of
the merger?
“Total wages paid were substanti-
ally in excess of the amounts paid
during the financial year ended June
30, 1947. The effect of the 40-hqur
week, the new industry award (which
provides considerable increases in
marginal rates of pay), together with
regular quarterly Cost-of-living ad-
justments, were the main causes of
this increase. Direct wages alone
represent approximately 25 per cent,
of our total production cost. When
we add to this the total of indirect
wages involved in our purchases of
Australian - produced raw materials
such as pulpwood, it will be realised
to what degree upward wages move-
ments affect our costs.
“Figures are revealing. A two-
shilling increase in the basic wage
lifts our direct wages bill by £25,000
per annum, which means an added
cost per ton of product of four shil-
lings. The added indirect cost is at
least as much again.
“The fuel shortage in Victoria has
been largely overcome by the use of
brown coal from a subsidiary-operated
open-cut at Bacchus Marsh which we
established as an urgent necessity.
This open-cut is now yielding some
2500 tons per week, and it is ex-
pected that the output will rise to
at least 6000 tons per week. In
New South Wales the fuel position
is not satisfactory, but the authorities
there have helped us to the limit in
very difficult circumstances. We are
hopeful of more assured supplies
shortly, Unfortunately we lost some
machine time as the result of black-
coal rationing in New South Wales.
SECURITY PLAN:
“The introduction of our Security
Plan is a milestone in the develop-
ment of our thinking and practice in
the field of human relations in in-
dustry. Recently the Prime Minister
stated that ‘the best incentive which
can be given to workers is a sense
of security—security of employment
and security against sickness, unem-
ployment and the disabilities of old
age.’ There is much truth in this
statement, and while we do not be-
lieve that any individual scheme is a
panacea, we can fairly say that our
Security Plan aims to provide, in co-
operation with employees themselves,
a much greater degree of economic
security in periods of sickness and
involuntary absence from work, than
they have ever had before, and that
it also aims, to provide, subject to
the necessary exceptions in the case
of misdemeanor, much greater secu-
rity of earnings than has ever existed
before. On the sickness side, adult
male employees will receive a sick
benefit of £6 per week, which is in
the vicinity of the present basic wage.
The employees contribute approxi-
mately 25 per cent, of the money
necessary to secure this Benefit, and
the Company pays the remaining 75
per cent. On the employment side
it has been arranged that instead of
the usual one week’s notice of ter-
mination, progressively longer periods
of notice will be given, commencing
with one month’s notice for those
with a minimum of two years’ service
and increasing to one year’s notice
with a minimum of 15 years’ service.
“I speak of this scheme at some
length, not with the idea of making
a display of something which the
Company has done; rather I mention
it in order to drive home the point
that we are giving serious and con-
tinuous attention to the problems of
happiness and morale in industry. We
know that this question of economic
security is only a part of the whole
problem, and that there are many
others —some social, some political
and some psychological—yet to be
tackled.
“It will be realised, and I feel I
should emphasise this point, that such
social benefits can only be developed
out of efficient production. So that
they may be continued and extended,
managements and employees alike
must strive untiringly for greater
efficiency and maximum production.
WAGES:
“In February of this year the Pulp
and Paper Manufacturing Industry
award came into operation—the first
general award of the Federal Arbi-
tration Court covering pulp and
paper production workers. The most
pleasing feature of this award in the
view of your Board is that, to a
major degree, it was an agreement
reached by all the paper companies
of Australia (except one) and a num-
ber of important unions. While your
Board supports the general principle
of the Conciliation and Arbitration
Acts, it believes that the relations
between managements, unions and
employees must be cemented by de-
veloping the spirit of consultation and
agreement, rather than by fighting out
every issue before an arbitrator.
“At Maryvale it has been found
necessary to give a high priority to
housing, and our Construction Branch
has done a very creditable job in
this regard. Altogether since the
establishment of this mill we have
built 230 houses in Morwell and
Traralgon. Of these 70 have been
completed during the year under re-
view and we are now finishing further
houses at the rate of two a week.
In all we plan a total of over 550
houses for employees at this mill.
This is apart from bparding-house
accommodation to be provided for
200 employees.
“I would now like to touch briefly
on our responsibilities in the great
expansion programme which lies
ahead of us. I referred earlier in this
address to the rising cost of asset re-
placement. So is there a rising cost
of new development and, in money
terms, the capital required to finance
our programme is very high. Esti-
mates made in 1944, which them-
selves made allowance for substantial
increases in cost by comparison with
pre-war days, have proved to be seri-
ously short of the mark. To some
extent this may be due to inefficiency
and shortages in the construction
trades, but it is also part of a world-
wide inflationary movement which has
largely been generated by the war
and all that was involved in war-time
finance —and probably also to defects
in post-war financial policies.
“What should we do under these
circumstances? We could say ‘Oh,
well, the best thing is to stop where
we are, use our present capital equip-
ment, which was installed at relatively
low costs, and let someone else do
the development.’ While develop-
ment programmes have to be reviewed
constantly in the fight of financial
and economic conditions, your Board
does not hold the view that the de-
velopment of the paper industry in
this country should be left to others
because it believes that your Company
• —Australian Paper Manufacturers,
Ltd.—should be a living and vital
part of the Australian industrial
structure. Your Board believes that,
so long as the developments them-
selves are essentially sound, and are
based on sound economic studies of
requirements in this country, then
they should proceed. Australia is
embarking—rightly, most of us be-
lieve —upon a major programme of
population expansion. If we are to
absorb this increased population we
must have industrial development in
this country on many fronts, and this
Company must play its part.
“Your Board has been very con-
cerned to make sure that, in under-
taking its big programme of expan-
sion, it will be doing the right thing
in the interests of the shareholders,
its employees, its customers and the
country generally. It is convinced
that it is doing the right thing, but
it believes that the road ahead is not
easy, and that all concerned must
understand this if they are to play
their part. We are calling on our
employees to help—as they can do —
by closer co-operation, higher effi-
ciency, greater production; we ex-
pect Governments to help—as they
can do —by facilitating and assisting
our work in many directions; we look
to you, as shareholders, to help—as
you can do —by standing behind these
developments, not only with your
savings but with your interest and
support,
“I now wish to make reference to
the Managing Directorship of your
Company from two angles—the re-
tirement from the office of Sir Her-
bert Gepp and his succession by
Mr. Charles Booth.
“Sir Herbert Gepp has resigned as
Managing Director after occupying
that position for 13 years. During
that time the Company has grown
considerably and Sir Herbert had to
deal with many large and difficult
problems the most important of which
was the establishment of the Kraft
Pulp Mill at Maryvale, Up to the
time when the decision was taken to
erect this Pulp Mill, it was always
believed that the Australian hard-
woods were unsuitable for producing
pulp for our purposes, but it has
now been established, due in a very
large measure to Sir Herbert, that
this view was quite incorrect.
“Sir Herbert has been an indefatig-
able worker in the cause of the Com-
pany, always setting its interests above
his own. Recently he has completed
a most important review of matters
relating to the Company acquired
during a trip round the world which
he took prior to retirement and which
will, it is confidently believed, prove
of the greatest value to the Company.
He is not severing his connection with
the Company, He remains as a
Director and member of the Executive
and has also agreed to act in a con-
sultative capacity. We hope to have
the benefit of his sound advice for
many years to come.
“His place has been taken by Mr.
Charles Booth, who has been a
Director of the Company for four
years. He was appointed to that
position after being in close contact
with the Company for 15 years as the
representative in Australia of Walms-
leys (Bury), Limited, the manufac-
turers of the Company’s paper and
board machines. He is a qualified
engineer and has a knowledge second
to none of the machines over which
he now has supreme control. It was
because of the sound advice and
judgment brought to bear by him on
the various matters dealt with by the
Board, together with his work as.
Acting-Managing Director during Sir
Herbert’s absence overseas, that his
fellow-Directors asked him to accept
the position of Managing Director.
We look forward with every con-
fidence to the future with Mr. Booth
as the Company’s chief executive
officer.
“Finally let me refer to our staff
and employees. In its staff your
Company has a large body of ener-
getic and efficient men and women,
both on the technical and commercial
sides. With the zealous and loyal
work of the employees in the mills,
they have jointly achieved much over
the past twelve months in circum-
stances which have continued to be
difficult. We are fortunate in this
and, on behalf of all shareholders, I
express to them our sincere thanks.”

Perpetual Trustee Company Limited was constituted
In 1886 to render important services to the Community
—principally those of Executor and Trustee.
Men of affairs soon began to recognise the wisdom
of appointing a Company of stability and responsibility
to undertake such specialised duties.
By 1900, the Trust and Agency Funds under the
Company’s administration amounted to £3,928,520.
As the efficiency of the Company’s methods, and its
courteous, helpful service became more widely known,
an ever increasing number of men (and women) placed
their affairs in its expert care.
To-day the Perpetual Trustee Company Limited
stands as one of the largest Trustee Companies in the
world. The Trust and Agency Funds under its adminis-
tration exceed £67,000,000.
These vast funds include many large Estates, in-
dustrial, investment and pastoral—although the value
of the average Estate is less than £lO,OOO.
An' interesting booklet “YOUR EXECUTOR AND
TRUSTEE ” describes the services the Company renders
—and its charges. It gives some reasons why the wise
man (and woman) should take advantage of its service.

Oil Search, Ltd.
Oil Search, Ltd., listed on the
Stock Exchanges of Australia
and actively dealt in, is issuing
2,100,000 new shares of ss. each
in order to maintain its one-fifth
interest in the capital of Austral-
asian Petroleum Co., which has
been exploring and drilling for
oil in Papua for several years,
and which is now going to under-
take a still more intensive
search.
The exploration and drilling
company is controlled mainly by
Vacuum Oil (the Australian sub-
sidiary of Standard-Vacuum Oil,
New York) and D’Arcy Ex-
ploration Co., London, an off-
shoot of the Anglo-Iranian Oil
Co.: these two concerns own
the 80 p.c, of the scrip not held
by Oil Search. The joining of
forces occurred in October, 1938,
when Oil Search, finding itself
incapable of carrying on a vigor-
ous hunt for oil on its Papuan
concessions without further
financial and technical assist-
ance, pooled its resources with
the New York and London in-
terests. Australia, London and
New York each originally held
a one-third interest in Austral-
asian Petroleum; but, as the
prospecting programme went on
and called for more capital, Oil
Search was not always able to
take up its quota of new issues,
with the result that its propor-
tion fell from a third to a fifth.
Up to the end of 1939 it was
estimated that £1,850,000 had
been spent by all parties in
searching for oil in Papua. When
Australasian Petroleum spudded-
in its first drill at Kariava, 75
miles up the Vailala River (on
Papua’s southern coast), in
March, 1941, the outgo had
grown to over £2,000,000. In-
cluding outlay on equipment, an-
other £1,000,000 of capital has
been expended since. The
Vailala borehole, operations in
respect of which were suspended
during the Pacific war, was sunk
to 12,000 feet this year, when it
was abandoned as unproductive.
The geological and geophysi-
cal surveys, in addition to the
data derived from the Kariava
borehole, have prompted a much
larger drilling campaign by Aus-
tralasian Petroleum. Addressing
shareholders in Oil Search at the
annual meeting, chairman W. A.
Freeman said;
The drilling programme envisaged
by the directors of Australasian
Petroleum has already been opened
at Oroi, where a rig is in operation
on a location on the coast some 60
miles north-west of Port Moresby.
Preparations for drilling at two other
locations, viz., Hohoro and Upoia,
on the Vailala River, are well ad-
vanced, and drilling should commence
there later in the year. In addition
to the rigs at Hohoro, Upoia and
Oroi, Australasian Petroleum has de-
cided to purchase two more drilling
outfits—one heavy plant capable of
reaching 10,000 feet and a lighter
plant with a range of 6000 to 7000
feet. Thus provision is being made
for five drilling rigs to be in operation
towards the end of next year.
In addition to drilling on selected
locations, Australasian Petroleum will
carry out detailed geological and geo-
physical surveys which will be con-
tinued throughout 1949 in permit
areas in both Papua and New Guinea.
All those varied activities entail the
provision of much auxiliary equip-
ment, and shipping facilities for the
conveyance of personnel, stores and
machinery. Some idea of the mag-
nitude of this enterprise will be gained
from the size of the staff employed,
which will comprise some 380 Euro-
peans and 2500 native laborers.
Of the 2,100,000 new ss.
shares being issued by Oil
Search, 1,400,000 will be offered
in the first place to existing
shareholders, and 700,000 will be
taken firm by the underwriters.
When subscribed the capital
issued by Oil Search, Ltd.,
will be 4,825,219 shares of
ss. each, and paid capital will be
over £1,200,000. On the basis of
a one-fifth interest in the operat-
ing company, par-value capitali-
sation of the whole joint under-
taking will be somewhere in the
vicinity of £6,000,000,
At the annual meeting of Oil
Search shareholders Mr. Freeman
said: “We are now entering what
I hope will be the final phase of
our operations in Papua, and to
bring to a successful issue the
great search on which we have
been engaged for so long.”
The programme of Australasian
Petroleum appears to be carried
out expertly and vigorously, and
a decision on the oil-bearing
possibilities of southern Papua
“ Remember —getting ten employee shares doesn't entitle
you to keep directors' hours."
should be reached before the
end of 1951. The scrip of Oil
Search, Ltd., represents a very
interesting speculation in a com-
petent venture, though as the
share - register expands the
greater becomes the capital over
which any future dividends will
have to be spread. Still, though
the striking of a major oilfield
would not now represent, pro-
portionately, such a spectacular
profit to shareholders as it might
have in 1941, it should pro-
vide an attractive return. And,
of course, if oil is struck in the *
near future, new investors in the
issue will not have had such a
long wait as those who have
been in Oil Search since the be-
ginning.
The market pays around
ss. 7d. for Oil Search shares at
present. They rose as high as
11s. in 1947.
“Control” of Industry
The United States Congress of
Industrial Organisations recently
revived the old picture of “rela-
tively small groups of people, by
direct ownership and various
control devices, deciding the
basic economic policy of
America —how many factories
shall be built, how much com-
panies should save, and what
wage-increases should or should
not be granted,”
The same sort of argument has
been raised in Australia many
times, and with less justification.
But the National City Bank of
New York queries the C. 1.0.
presentation of the case, and,
where it makes any admissions,
says, in effect. So what?
The Ford Motor Company has
been substantially under the control
of one man or one single family ever
since its founding in 1903. But, the
question may be asked, what of it?
Is not the really important question,
who have benefited from the
operations of the Ford Company?
Who have owned the millions of
motor-cars produced by the Ford
Company? Certainly not the Ford
family alone!
Everyone knows that Henry Ford’s
achievement was in putting prices
down within reach of the average
citizen, while paying wages higher
than those generally current in in-
dustry, and using the major share
of profits to add to plant and to
buy tools and equipment to make
still more cars.
As has been stated before by this
bank, that a business owned by thou-
sands of shareholders must be direc-
ted and managed by a relatively small
number is necessarily true, but “con-
trol” in this sense may not mean what
is often assumed of it. It certainly
does not mean that the earnings of
the business do not belong to all the
shareholders or that the latter will not
receive them. Nor does it mean that
in the future there will be no oppor-
tunities for individuals of initiative
and business capacity, or that all of
the business of the country will be
done by large corporations.
However, instead of an argument,
the best answer to such problems is
to be bad from the facts of past
experience. What finally becomes of
the products of the economic system?
How many share in them ahd how?
Where do they disappear? Is it true
that the tendency to closer co-
operation, larger corporations and a
wider distribution of ownership tends
either to lessen the volume of pro-
duction or to concentrate the benefits
of the system in the hands of a few?
The answer to the last question is
clearly no. The facts of past ex-
perience—the whole history of the
development of American industry
and rise in American living standards
■—refute this thesis.
The C. 1.0. says that two dollars
out of every three dollars spent in
America goes to corporations. With
the widespread use of the corporate
form of organisation —by business,
large and small, banks, insurance
companies, the Government itself,
churches, universities, fraternal and
charitable organisations, even trade-
unions—this statement may possibly
be true. The corporation is a form
of co-operative enterprise which is an
essential part of the institutional
structure of modern-day society. If
corporations receive two dollars out
of every three they also spend around
two dollars out of every three, and
it also follows that a good part of
the money spent is passed from one
corporation to another—for example,
as merchants pay their bills for goods
and freight charges.
What the C. 1.0. evidently wants to
imply is that there is something
nefarious about the distribution of the
money business corporations take in.
For an answer to this we have only
to look at the Department of Com-
merce compilations on the disposal
of income originating in corporate
business. The following analysis is
drawn from their data for 1947: —
Disposal of Income Originating in
Corporate Business, 1947.
Percentage.
Pay of employees 73.1
Income taxes 10.4
Dividends 5.9
Interest • • 1-0
Profits ploughed back into
business 9.6
Total income originating in
corporate business .. 100.0
Dividends received by the owners
came to s6£ billion, or 6 p.c. of the
total company incomes. The income-
tax collector took more than half
again as much, 10 p.c. Ploughed-
back profits came to 9i p.c. The
lion’s share went to employees, com-
pensation of whom aggregated $B2
billion, 73 p.c. of the total.
If, as the C. 1.0. claims, “a relatively
small group of people” decide “what
wage increases should or should not
be granted,” and all the rest, it is
indeed interesting that such a relatively
small part of the income should be
taken by the owners while the highest
wages ever known in this or any other
country are paid to the working man.
How much larger share of the pie
does the C. 1.0. think ought to be
paid to employees?
The myth of the mystical “they”—
who decide everything —is an old
bugaboo that is repeatedly resurrected
to scare people. The C. 1.0. itself is
well aware that there are two sides
to the bargaining-table in wage nego-
tiations. The consumer is well aware
of his power of choice between com-
peting products. The employer is
well aware of the necessity of meeting
the competition of other employers
for labor as well as of maintaining
a price that will command a broad
market. Pretty nearly everyone knows
how often the Government puts in
an oar on wage negotiations.
As the figures show, the rewards for
taking business risks—which dividends

represent —are a moderate proportion
of the revenues of corporations.
These dividends in turn go to millions
of holders. Anyone can get himself
on the share-register who is willing
to take a risk with his money, and
anyone can adjust his holdings up or
down within the limits of his resources
and willingness to abstain from pre-
sent consumption for a future gain.
The secret of the larger individual
stockholdings lies in successful risk-
taking. And whether the individual
wins or lefces, the society as a whole
gains from the capital he has provided
and the competition he has injected.
The same cannot be said of the State
lotteries, which in Russia and else-
where serve as an outlet for the irre-
pressible yearnings of men to advance
themselves beyond their neighbors.
The picture that the C. 1.0. draws
—of autocratic monopoly crushing
down the worker and snuffing out
the small businessman —is one that
cannot be reconciled with the
31.000. passenger cars on the road,
the 36,500,000 telephones in service,
the 68,000,000 radios, and the elec-
trical appliances and gadgets beyond
all count in the home. In many other
lands these things, plus innumerable
other conveniences and luxuries that
the average American takes for
granted, are reserved to the few. Nor
can the C. 1.0. theory that the small
businessman is “disappearing” be re-
conciled with the reports of the
Department of Commerce that the
number of businesses in operation has
hit a new peak for all time of
3.848.000.
The shoe fits much better on a
thoroughly “planned,” socialised, or
communised economy. There the fact
of concentrated authority, in “a rela-
tively small group of people,” is
beyond cavil. Whether the public
gains or loses by such socialisation
depends, of course, on the degree of
progressiveness and efficiency with
which the industries are run. If
soundly run, even socialised industries
must withhold some portion of the
earnings from distribution for renewal
and expansion of plant to keep up
with increasing demands. The small
percentage of the profits which share-
holders under private enterprise take
for their own personal use, and do
not plough back by way of reinvest-
ment in enlarging the capacity of the
industries, seems a small price to pay
for the dynamic quality inherent in
the capitalistic system.
As for monopoly-power, that which
has been brought most forcibly to
the attention of the American people
in recent years is not one held by
any group of business leaders. Rather
it is the power held by the leadership
of the coalminers to close the mines,
turn off the nation’s fuel supply, and
stall the whole machinery of our
civilisation.
N.Z. Coal-nationalisation
Holders of shares in New
Zealand’s Waikato coalmines —
at least in the largest, owned by
Taupiri Coal Mines, Ltd. —have
the laugh over their Govern-
ment. After a battle of wits for
16 months since the State bought
out the Westport Coal Co. in
June, 1947, for £900,000, or £2
a share, Taupiri directors gave
their O.K. at the end of Sep-
tember to a Government offer
of £823,000, which worked out
at about 30s. for the 20,000
prefs. and £6 2s. for 130,000
ords.
Maoriland brokers and inves-
tors gasped when they heard the
price, and Taupiri’s chairman,
J. B. Donald, sitting on the box-
seat, went to some pains to un-
derline the value of the assets
to be nationalised. Only share-
holders’ approval is needed now
to make the deal complete, and
they don’t mind how soon
they’re asked to say “yes,”
There are four cos. in the
Waikato coal group, with capi-
tal totalling £452,000; but one
(Glen Afton Collieries, Ltd.),
farmer-owned, isn’t in the mar-
ket for sale to the State. The
other two. Renown Collieries,
Ltd. (capital £102,000), and
Pukemiro Collieries, Ltd.
(£100,000), are waiting for the
Government to make them
tempting offers. All three ear-
marked for nationalisation have
been shrewd negotiators. In-
stead of elbowing each other to
get in first, they’ve taken the
hurdles in leisurely style and
have made the most of the State
subsidy on coal, at taxpayers’
expense, as a comfortable shelter
against mounting wages, shorter
hours and other higher costs, and
have paid good divs. while
hovering round the bargaining
counter.
The Government expected the
Waikato mines to fall like ripe
apples into its lap after the West-
port deal was nicely fixed up,
but the cos. had different ideas.
They outdid Laborites wedded
to socialisation plans in a game
of patience where the price was
at stake. With little over a year
to go before the next election,
and worried over the stalemate
in coal-nationalisation. Minister
of Mines McLagen took the bit
in his teeth. The price of
£832,000 is well over double that
of £355,919 shown in Taupiri’s
last balance-sheet (year ended
March) as the value of the co.’s
assets, but no one could argue
that the sale should have been
based on disclosed assets, for
there’s an estimated 90 million
tons of coal in the rich field of
16,000 acres over which the co.
has mining rights, with at least
seven million of these tons near
enough the surface for open-cast
working.
Investors have been contrast-
ing the £6 2s. to be paid to
Taupiri with £2 ss. handed over
for Bank of N.Z. shares in No-
vember, 1945, when the Govern-
ment gave shareholders a raw
deal. In that grab there was
no pretence at negotiating;
shareholders, denied any right of
appeal, were led like lambs to
the slaughter.
A Queensland Budget
Though the long railway strike
early this year changed an esti-
mated Queensland surplus of
£12,427 into a deficit of £94,632
for 1947-48, the railways con-
tinued to be the State’s chief
revenue-earner, accounting for
£10.9 million in a total revenue
of £26.8 million, nearly a half-
million below the estimate.
Chief income after railway
revenue was taxation £lO.B mil-
lion, land revenue £787,000,
timber £417,000, pastoral rents
£400,000, mining £57,000 —round
figures.
About the first thing Treasurer
Larcombe noticed was a jump in
transport fees from the estimated
£103,401 to £313,401, obviously
brought about by that same rail-
way strike when private road-
hauliers rallied to Premier Han-
lon’s call and did their best to
keep foodstuffs and essential
material on the move —and paid
for the privilege. All chief
revenue items except railways
were above estimates, and the
Hanlons got £825,125 more in
income-tax reimbursement grants
from the overstuffed Common-
wealth Treasury. Expenditure
was below estimate at £26.9 mil-
lion, but £l.B million more than
in 1946-47, the increase being
mainly in Health and Home
Affairs and public works.
The State public-debt posi-
tion;
At 30/6/’4B it was £138,693,978,
which exceeded the debt at the end
of the previous year by £3,338,449.
Standing to the credit of the State
in the national debt sinking-fund was
£271,962, leaving a net loan liability
of £138,422,016, as compared with
£134,977,484 at the end of June, 1947.
It is worthy of note that although
the gross public debt of the State
increased by £12,912,424 from June
30, 1938, to the end of June, 1948,
the debt per head of population actu-
ally decreased; this notwithstanding
that during the ten-year period
£31,487,019 was expended from loan
fund on public works, etc.
Certain loans matured in Australia
during the year and were converted,
but there were no maturities in Lon-
don or America. However, the Com-
monwealth exercised option rights in
respect of certain loans in America,
which affected Queensland’s debt.
During the year the National Debt
Commission redeemed Queensland
to £1,428,931,
as compared with £2,338,131 in
1946-47.
Big things are promised
for the coming year, including
the Burdekin Dam, an “ade-
quate” main-roads programme,
“decentralisation” with the help
of Blair Athol, the C.Q. food
scheme and “fostering of indus-
tries by financial assistance and
odierw i se ” ( a Townsville cement
concern has a Government
guarantee o£ £200.000), electri-
c j t y and housing,
Matters like the sugar hold-
UP ,
age , the strong agitation tor
separation in the north and the
current drought in the west are,
of course, outside the scope of
a Treasurer s Budget speech.
Taxes and Social Security
Only one bright spot, a £lO
cut in taxes for everyone,
appeared in N.Z.’s 13th
Labor Budget. If Maoriland
Laborites have juicy tax-conces-
sions up their sleeves they’re
keeping them for 1949 election
year. The £lO flat tax-cut helps
mostly at the bottom of the scale,
where most voters are. It’s a
shrewd way of buying support
at small cost, for the total loss
to the Treasury is only £3} mil-
lion. Other minor tax handouts
to make up the total to £4 mil-
lion are the 125.6 d.-an-ounce
gold-duty wiped out, the motor-
halved (from
omnibus sales tax naivea uxom
20 to 10 p.c.) to help clamorous
public-transport operators, and
the 5 p.c. tax on all overseas
passenger-fares struck off
Total tax estimates, atter tue
cuts, are up £4 million to a new
all-time peak of over £126 mil-
lion, or £69 a head ; but the k.o.
to the exchange premium came
after these figures were chalked-
so resu b s won ’t work out
according to estimates Customs-
duty and sales tax will be down.

SUNDRY SHOWS
TWO PAINTERS.
The only common link be-
tween Douglas Pratt’s paintings
at the Grosvenor Gallery,
George-street, and those of
Geoff Jones, at the Macquarie
Galleries, Bligh-street, is the
fact that they are being shown at
the same time in Sydney. Other-
wise there is little evidence that
the two painters live in the same
century, country, or even in the
same world.
Pratt paints the Australian
countryside—the Murrumbidgee
at Yass and Kiandra, the Bur-
ragorang Valley, Nimmitabel
and Terrigal and Merriwa, Jugi-
ong and Pentecost Island, North
Queensland. Jones paints in a
manner currently fashionable in
some Australian cities —a sym-
bolic vista of slums and a few
symbolic ruins (“Blitzed City”);
a document in the shape
of three stevedores ; and roses
and shells, dahlias, pansies,
tufips and a jug with fruit, which
are vaguely pleasant as pieces of
interior design, but which bear
no obvious relationship to real
roses, tulips or fruit. The best
of Jones’s paintings are deco-
rative ; the worst of Pratt’s are
dull.
Pratt has the overwhelming
advantage in subject matter. The
Murrumbidgee and Nimmita-
bel, Jugiong and Merriwa have
a kind of native poetry in them.
There is nothing poetic, or re-
cognisably indigenous, about
Jones’s “Three Stevedores,” for
instance, except, perhaps, the
newspaper racing-form which
they are reading. It belongs to
the dreary class of social docu-
ments of rather indeterminate
purpose —the purpose, appar-
ently, being to show that steve-
dores are interested in horse-
racing. But the men themselves
are cyphers—three symbolic
fence-posts rooted before a
newspaper.
Pratt’s “Late Afternoon, near
Cooma,” is a fine piece of paint-
ing. Golden poplars leap out
of a frame of quiet countryside,
a creek, and grazing cattle, with
a lightly-touched background.
In other paintings one is too
much aware of the paint, and, in
his numerous pictures of gum-
trees, Pratt never quite achieves
in oils the strength and delicacy
of his pencil drawings. An-
other weakness, again, is subject
matter, not in the broad sense —
in which Jones selects a slum as
a symbol of enduring beauty—
but in the narrow field' of selec-
tion. Some paintings are tech-
nically competent, with color,
sound construction and accurate
detail, but they are dull; nature
has, in these instances, been re-
corded too faithfully.
There is a similar fidelity in
Pratt’s city paintings, particu-
larly in “St. James and King-
street,” a very skilful picture of
a busy city intersection, with
almost loving detail, color and
warmth. Yet it is almost too
perfect, like a fine photograph.
Jones’s pictures of Arabs and
Egyptians, Malta and Elizabeth
Bay are far removed from any-
thing Pratt has painted. Where
he does not symbolise, Jones
retreats into a kind of negative
delicacy which is charming as
far as it goes, but that is not
very far. “The White Blouse,”
for instance, is a vague portrait
of a girl with a white blouse and
downcast eyes and toylike
hands; it is large, but faint.
There is the same dim negative
quality about the brighter
“Small Arab Girl.” The bright-
ness is superficial—a red cloak
and a face of impassive nigger-
brown.
“Bondi Bathers” is large, and
what seems to be an impression-
istic blur of pink and brown and
cold green lines resolves into
recognisably human forms and
beach umbrellas. But there is a
conscious effort in the recogni-
tion. One has the feeling that
this is not life observed at first-
hand, but an imperfect artistic
convention about life, A small
landscape, “T h e Summer
House,” is a dainty piece of paint
with something of the naivety
of child-art about, it, and a
breath of childlike spontaneity.
"Andrea Chenier."
A hundred yeafs hence, if
someone writes an opera about
the Golden Age of Chifley,
it will probably be very like this
picture of the French Revolu-
tion of Giordano. There will
be Reds, pinks, pale-pinks,
Leftists and fellow-travellers in
it, and there will be a beautiful
bourgeois maiden in love with a
writer, sentenced to be hanged,
drawn and quartered for writing
an obscene libel, and she will be
smuggled into his cell and they
will go singing a lovely duet to
the scaffold.
The poet in Giordano’s opus
was a historical figure, but no-
body knows what happened to
him except that he fell a victim
to the revolution. In the
Italian company’s performance
at Melbourne His Majesty’s
under Wolff - Ferrari’s baton
there is a servant who is secretly
in love with Maddalena, the
daughter of a countess, and
there is a poet who has revolu-
tionary tendencies and is in love
with the sarae v fair lady. The
servant becomes a commissar or
something in the subsequent
revolution, and the poet gets into
hot water by denouncing Robes-
pierre, who makes a brief ap-
pearance.
The commissar seeks to
possess Maddalena when she
comes to meet the poet. They
fight with swords, the commis-
sar is wounded and the poet
arrested. He is haled before the
tribunal and the commissar
draws up the indictment. But
Maddalena has offered herself to
him if he saves her lover, and
he declares the charge to- be
false. The mob, however, roars
for the blood of the poet, and
he and his mistress go melodi-
ously to the guillotine together.
Giordano had no great gift
for sustained melody, though he
had a distinct flair for musical
crowd scenes, and there is only
one grand opportunity for Ger-
mana di Giulio to display the
silky quality of her voice as well
as its remarkable volume. Raf-
fael Lagares gave his usual in-
effective acting and his splendid
tenor to the poet, and Enzo
Titta made the servant turned
revolutionary into a convincing
figure. The mob of J.C.W.
chorus-men and -ladies started
rather weakly, but worked up
to a magnificent state of revolu-
tionary hysteria in the finale.
"The Philadelphia
Story."
With occasional brief excur-
sions above and below the line,
Whitehall Productions’ presen-
tation of “The Philadelphia
Story” (Sydney Minerva) pursues
a course of steady mediocrity.
Such purely mechanical, though
important, adjuncts as stage-sets
(drab) and lighting (inadequate)
fall short of the mark, and, on
the opening night, there seemed
to be a lack of agreement among
the cast as to just what the thing
was all about. After the first
act, done in jerkily farcical
fashion, it seemed that all and
sundry had got their heads to-
gether and decided to head off
on an entirely new tack. The
result was a distinct improve-
ment in subsequent acts.
Despite having to stand mental
comparison with Katharine Hep-
burn’s portrayal of the same
part, Gwenda Wilson made a
fair fist of Tracy Lord; Doro-
thea Dunstan, as the teenage
Dinah Lord, hurled herself into
the furniture with presumably
appropriate vigor; and Grant
Taylor did well enough with
what little he was given to do.
John O’Malley and Bettie
Dickson were suitably hard-
boiled representatives of that
weird species Journalist Ameri-
canus. Others were reasonably
competent, but several roles
appeared to have been intro-
duced for no other reason than
to people the stage.
La Joselito, a Spanish dancer
who wears black hats with red
linings, stamps her feet like a
little stallion until the boards
ring, plays astonishing variations
on the castanets with her fingers
and puts sufficient flaming
vitality into one dance to last a
ballet company for a whole
evening, has been populating the
Town Halls of Melbourne and
Sydney with all the tradi-
tional characters of the An-
dalusian scene and making
them live. She is the direct anti-
thesis of Juan Relampago, her
guitarist. When an apologetic-
looking, elderly and bald-headed
man came diffidently out with
a chair and a guitar and
plomped them on the platform
everybody thought it was a
Town Hall assistant. When he
took his seat, picked up his
guitar and sprayed his long
white fingers over it, however,
his skill was revealed as in the
same order as the Joselito’s. Un-
fortunately, Town Halls aren’t
built with any consideration for
guitarists.
♦ * * *
Mosman Musical Society’s
“Vagabond King” has all the
color and splash of a profes-
sional performance. Well drilled
by producer Maxwell Dunn, a
platoon of bright beauties and
young men whizz smartly
through the tuneful piece of
romantic nonsense from the
tavern scene to the grand finale,
all aided and abetted by Mavis
Sykes’s dancing girls and Her-
bert Wyatt’s musical direction.
Eddie Devereaux is a suitably
dashing Villon and Betty Par-

Women’s Letters
From Melbourne
Blue lovebirds in a gilded cage sus-
pended from a wistaria-twined arch aris-
ing from a bed of purple pansies; green
lawns banked high with calceolaria,
schizantha and primula ; pale-pink sweet-
peas scattered round an oval table. These
were highlights of the unusual decora-
tions which beautified the reception-room
at the Town Hall when the Lady Mayor-
ess, Mrs. J. S. Disney, held her first
formal luncheon-party. She wore an
amethyst-toned wool crepe ensemble, the
three-tiered skirt and matching bolero
edged with narrow kiltingi Her large,
black straw hat was trimmed with black
velvet and amethyst veiling, and heirloom
amethyst jewellery completed an arrest-
ing outfit. Four former Lady Mayoresses
were present; Lady Wales, in a blue-and-
white diamond-patterned frock and hip-
length jacket with a small cyclamen
straw hat. Lady Beaurepaire, smart in an
all-black ensemble, Mrs. Beatrice Camp-
bell, whose primrose-yellow straw hat was
trimmed with pastel-blue and worn with
a black frock, and Mrs. Bernard Heinze,
who chose a black jacket suit and small
black hat trimmed with a long black
feather.
Lady Dugan has lent her patronage lo
the Fashion Fantasy to be held at the
Princess Theatre on October 19, to aid
the U.N. Appeal for Children. The
committee is headed by Mrs. Garnet
Carroll. Madame Rambert is flying from
Adelaide to be present, and Walter Gore
and Sally Gilmour (Mrs. Alan Wynne)
will present “Bartlemas Fair,” a ballet
which has not been performed yet in this
country. Peter Gray, star of “Present
Laughter,” will compere the show,
assisted by his wife, Daphne Newton, who
is to compere the fashions. Tivoli stars
will be on the programme, and the A.B.C.
will present McDuff Williams and his
orchestra. Latest gift to the committee
is an Airedale puppy from Prof. Wood-
ruffe, and it will be up for Dutch auction
during the Fashion Fantasy,
Those who visited the International
Fair for Y.W.C.A. funds at the Town
Hall were greeted by the appetising smell
of hamburgers and coffee, made in the
foyer. Presiding over the culinary
mysteries were Americans, headed by
Mrs. Herbert Allen and her assistants,
among them Mesdames H. Bettle and
W. W. Killough, correctly dressed in
white overalls and tall chef caps. Further
along the foyer was the New York Drug
Store and the California Candy Bar, all
staffed by members of the American
colony. A cosmetic firm set up a beauty
bar and gave all proceeds to the funds.
Inside the hall was a veritable League of
Nations. The Dutch group served re-
freshments ; the Czechoslovakian stall
was stocked with lovely crystal glasses
and costume jewellery. Lady Dixon’s stall
represented Co vent Garden, and a coster’s
barrow was piled high with vegetables,
fruit and flowers. Mrs. T. J. Ryan had
tropical nuts and fruits flown from Bris-
bane to stock her Queensland stall. Mrs.
L. J. McConnan helped on the Food-for-
Britain stall, and Mrs. Jim Fitzgerald pre-
sided over a stall stocked with many
charming articles. Mrs. Dan Reddan
was the convenor of the Pitt-street,
Sydney, stall, and was charming in her
pastel-blue silk tailored frock. Mrs.
Essington Lewis introduced Mrs. Karl
Kumm, National President of the
Y.W.C.A., who opened the Fair. At
night groups of girls in beautiful national
costumes danced the folk dances of Italy,
Austria, Spain and Holland.
A globe of the world with colored
streamers coming down and held by
miniature figures representing all; nations
was set on the stage of St. Kilda Town
Hall when the International Club of Vic-
toria held its annual ball and festival.
Tables were decorated by different
nationalities. France had a Tree of
Liberty to celebrate the 100th anniversary
of 1848; Austria set a model of St.
Stephen’s Cathedral, Vienna, on its table
and Yugoslavia depicted a Slafa feast.
Visitors to this table were offered hospi-
tality in true Yugoslavian tradition ; there
were rice cooked with walnuts, honey and
raisins, and wine and black coffee. Hol-
land centred the table with tulips and a
small windmill. Others represented were
Scotland, Finland and Estonia,
Flags of all nations hung from the
balconies, and during the evening a
march of the nations and national dances
were presented. Official guests included
the Consul-General of the U.S.A., J. S,
Fletcher, and Mrs. Fletcher, and the Con-
suls of Greece, Belgium and Czechoslo-
vakia and their wives. Mrs. Herbert
Brookes, smart in sage-green brocades.
president of the International Club, re-
ceived the guests. At the official table
were Mrs. H. Jamieson, elegant in black
crepe and silver foxes, Mrs. L. H. Eyles,
hon. sec., wearing white crepe with an
off-the-shoulder bodice and bouffant skirt,
and Mrs. H. G. Cartwright, who wore a
beautiful gown of copper-toned lame.
Her sister, Suzanne Hayward-Young,
chose a slim-fitting gown of black velvet
trimmed with diamente.
One of the smartest matrons in this city
is Mrs. Geoffrey Grimwade, pictured here,
and she certainly does not look like the
mother of four growing daughters. The
daughters do not restrict her charitable
activities. All through the war years she
worked in the canteen at Air Force
House. She has long enjoyed a reputa-
tion for smartness, for the suavity of her
hospitality and for the beauty of the
floral decor she maintains in her home.
It was logical that she should be a
member of the decorations committee
for the Derby Eve Ball, to be held at
Earl’s Court. Decorations are to be very
“racy,” with owners’ colors supplying the
motif and the ballroom transformed into
a replica of Flemington racecourse.
Ticket secretaries are Miranda Casey,
8J2012, Pamela Stevenson, 8J4628, and
Mrs. S. Odell, U 4152. Mrs. Odell is also
in charge of table reservations. President
of the ball, committee 'is Mrs. Chester
Guest, and proceeds from the function
will go to the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children.
Germana Di Giulio and Rafael
Lagares received an ovation at the end of
the first performance in this country of
“Andrea Chenier,” an opera with a
French Revolution setting. • For her first
appearance Di Giulio wears a glorious
white panniered brocade over pink satin,
but in later scenes dresses in keeping with
the revolutionary period. Among the ele-
gant first-night audience was Mrs. Guy
Hutchinson (Grace Angelau), who chose
a trained gown of black satin with the
bodice outlined in green and silver bro-
cade and over it a silver-fox cape. Mrs.
T. Alan McKay wore a gown of aqua-
blue crepe and a white Arctic-fox cape.
Also wearing a wrap of this luxurious fur
was Marjorie Spry, who contrasted it with
a ruby velvet gown. Helen Sutherland's
blue-marquisette gown was striped with
silver, and she wore a mink coat. With
Mrs. Hylton Dale was Mrs. S. Wood, and
another first-night enthusiast was Lillian
Wightman, smart in black and three-
quarter length black Persian-lamb coat.
Lieut.-General and Mrs. C. A. Clowes
entertained many of their friends at a
delightful buffet dinner in the Southern
Command officers’ mess at Albert Park.
Mrs. Clowes received her guests in a
graceful ankle-length frock of off-white
silk patterned in Wedgwood blue.
Among the guests were the Lieut.-
Governor, Sir Edmund Herring, and
Lady Herring, the latter wearing a smart
edge-to-edge coat of black wool romaine
oVer her aqua-blue tucked-crepe frock.
Mrs. H. Showers had pale-blue taffeta
bows adorning her black hat, which was
worn with a black ensemble, and Mrs.
Allan Walters chose a black moire taffeta
cocktail frock and a halo of gay flowers
worn at one side of her head. Mrs. E. C.
Wackett’s blue coat had a beige fox col-
lar and was worn with a flower hat, and
Mrs. T. B. Prickman’s black tricorne hat
was worn with a smart black coat. Wear-
ing a soft royal-blue frock and matching
hat, Mrs. J. A. Pietzcker was with her
husband, the Consul for Switzerland.
That day they celebrated their 51st wed-
ding anniversary. Other guests included
Brigadier and Mrs. H. Furnell, Air-
Commodore and Mrs. E. Hewitt and
Rear-Admiral Collins.
From Sydney
Though the sun was hot at Randwick
last Wednesday (Ladies’ Day) most
women had become a bit wary of the
weather’s whimsies, so the woollen suit
and frock were again well in the race.
The young and the brave who took a
chance on silken finery were rewarded
by warmth that turned to crisp coolness
only about 6 p.m. and by that time they
were back in the city basking in the
glow of cocktail parties. One of the
smartest and most attractive of mid-
week racegoers was Diana Robinson,
Worn over a patterned silk frock, her
coat of cinnamon-brown was of thick,
soft linen ; it was fitting to the waist, and
after that there was a suggestion of
Regency fullness, just right for Diana’s
slim tallness. She was with her mother,
Mrs. Clive Robinson, trig in navy and
white. Mrs. C. R. McKerihan’s Baku
hat was of hyacinth-blue, its edge tulle-
swathed. The skirt of her flower-
patterned crepe was finely pleated.
With her grey suit Mrs. George Duncan
wore a sailor hat of white Leghorn,
banded in black velvet. Mrs, Del
Morrow, Mrs. N. Somerfield and Mrs.
Hill were enjoying the day together. Tall
and fair Joan Allen wore a water-lily-pink
linen coat that flared into fullness over
a black-and-pink silk frock. Her large
hat was also of pink linen. Mrs.
Bill Moses and Mrs. Fred Moses were
among the week’s race addicts, Mrs.
Alan Potter, whose husband is chairman
of the A.J.C., gave several lunch and tea
parties. You’d have liked Mrs. Marcel
Dekyvere’s primrose-green hat in Baku
straw. This toned in with her coat,
which was worn over a patterned silk
frock. Pretty and blonde Mrs. Day was
a Melbourne visitor.
The Australian Club bloomed with
talisman roses and other garden beauties
for its after-the-races party last Wednes-
day, the roses trailed blithely along the
stair rails from the shallow window-boxes
in which they grew. There was an
orchestra, the music of which could
sometimes be heard above the choir
(not at all heavenly) of human voices.
Hats of the women guests were al-
together admirable. In fact the
crowds were so great on the stairway and
in the club’s spacious rooms, filled with
light from their many windows overlook-
ing Macquarie-street, that hats were more
easily observed than dresses. There’s a
library, too, that almost rivals the Public
Library across the way. The champagne
cocktails were up to tradition.
One of the week’s admired and much-
photographed racegoers was Mrs. Millard
Hagon. Mrs. Hagon, who is a newly-
elected member of the State executive of
the Liberal Council, is widely known as
an excellent public-speaker, Norton
Trevaire photograph.
From the tall and dignified Ethiop, his
feet seemingly in a bed of white spring
blossom, guarding the big “conversation”
seat in the foyer, the Trocadero made
striking setting for the Black and White
Ball. For months this had been the
most - talked - about festivity of the
spring race-week. Decorations and
frocks were things to remember.
From the corners and sides of
the ceiling to the centre lights, great
bubbles of black and white balloons were
looped. At the top of the room, before
the bandstand, three more Ethiops, black
as ebony, white-turbaned and robed,
kept guard. There were spiky palms,
black and white for the occasion, in
black and white bowls; and of all
hideousness, black arum lilies mingling
with their white sisters. One table was
suggestive of the grave of Giselle with
black and white lily decor.
Every frock that entered looked brand-
new. There was a field-flower freshness
about the young girls in their billowy
white organzas and their hooped marquis-
ettes. The billows on older contours were
not so good. Girls floated about selling
white carnations for the men, lily-of-the-
valley and gardenias for the girls. Two
small boys, “Nubian slaves,” sold cigar-
ettes. The Governor-General, Mrs.
McKell and daughter Betty were guests
of honor. President of the ball com-
mittee, Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere, wore a
softly-pleated black tulle frock, and over
that a long loose coat of thick white
taffeta. This was double throughout and
collared in white Arctic fox.
Mrs. John Todd was clothed in
a dream of white Spanish lace.
Pretty Mrs. John Bovill was pic-
torial in black marquisette, very full,
through which there came a faint gleam
of pink. White net and broderie Anglaise
were effective partnership on Rosemary
Turnbull. First prize in the matron’s
frocks went to Mrs. Alexis Albert. This
was a snowdrift of white organdie and
net, spotted with prize-size hailstones,
Mrs, Ernest Watt’s black laces and
organza were easily another prizewinner,
and Sue Playfair was prizewinner in the
deb. class with her white tulles and
broderie Anglaise. Another goodlooker
was Mrs. Reg. Bettington. Mrs. C. R.
McKerihan wore black chiffons and
pearls. Mrs. Lennox Bode and Mrs.
Noel Vincent were among the gazed-
upon.
The A.B.C. had the distinction, in a
race-week that positively floated on cock-
tails, of giving a tea party. It was to
welcome pianist Jacob Lateiner, who is
not yet 20 and who the A.B.C.’s Mr,
James predicts will shake the world.
Conductors of great orchestras in
America share this opinion. Jacob is
dark, shy and unassuming.
The flower arrangements varied from
the dignity of waratahs to the languish-
ing of cream and golden roses. In be-
tween there were purple iris, U.S. Consul
Knowlton Hicks was there with his tall
young daughter, who is studying singing.
The wife of Justice Roper and Mrs.
George White and Mrs, Rupert Scam-
mell, Mrs, Hope Gibson and Mrs. Boyer
were others of the sex noted for
their inches well above the average.
Gladys Marks was there and Mrs. Bar-
bara Bennett. * Hat honors went to Mrs.
Hamilton Kirkland, who was going on
to the binge in the Australian Club. Her
small hat had loops of grass-green rib-
bon on its left, and for the rest was
mostly tiny field hyacinths of white
velvet,
Castanets trilling like a cicadas’ fiesta.
Castanets beating out the surge and urge
of drama caught the ear of coffee-drinkers
in the Coq d’Or restaurant last Friday
afternoon. Famed Spanish dancer La
Joselito was displaying the different tones
to a group of press and radio listeners.
There are different castanets for different
types of dancing. But they agree in one
thing. They must be kept warm, other-
wise they lose tone. La Joselito has
brought many sets with her, each set
snug in its own soft leather case. One
she inherited from her grandmother.
Madame is small, dark and has
a flashing smile full of friendliness. She
speaks little English. But last Monday
in the Town Hall she expressed the fire
and poetry of the dances of Andalusia,
Seville, Granada and many provinces of
her native land to an audience without
benefit or need of interpreters. On
October 15 and 18 La Joselito will again
appear.
Lights were up in Lindsay, the Darling
Point home of Mrs. C. W. Pye, last
Thursday night. Mrs. Pye was giving a
ball, aided by sons John and Walter, and
altogether more than 200 guests passed
through the pleasant drawing-room that
leads by long glass doors to the lawns.
Here, very gay, was the Henry V pavilion
for which Loudon Sainthill designed the
decor. It made its first appearance, you
remember, at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Dancing was on a specially laid down
floor, and slightly apart from it was an-
other marquee where supper was set.
Probably the youngest guest was Diana
Macarthur-Onslow, not long from Scot-
land. Ages ranged from 17 into the 70’s —
a three-generation Sydney cavalcade.
Florence Taylor, president of the
women’s section of the Australian Ameri-
can Association, spoke with quiet force
flashed occasionally with humor at the
lunch given in honor of the American
Ambassador, Myron Cowen, and Mrs.
Co wen last Friday. Over 160 guests came
to smile welcome across the midday
chop —pork for the great occasion. The
Savarin was so crowded that office-
bearers sat at a small table in the turn
of the stairs from George-street. Mrs.
Cowen’s suit was in the popular oatmeal
toning, and her hat of frilled and stiffened
net was a whole publicity campaign for
the U.S. in itself. Mrs. Orsen Nielsen and
Mrs. Knowlton Hicks, of America’s Con-
sular group, were other guests of honor.
Mrs. Manuel Alzate was another at the
official table. Her frock was of stiffened
organdie in white and cocoa-brown
stripes. It was ground-length and very
full, and altogether had a Lanvin look.
Her handbag was of finely-woven straw,
a special weave of the Philippines.

THE SERVICE MAN
FLEETS ARE STILL VITAL.
Despite the great development
of the carrying-power of air-
craft, the merchant ship remains
the prime cargo-mover over long
distances and the warship—par-
ticularly the aircraft-carrier —its
defender.
In short distances such as
were involved in the Burma
■campaign or in the feeding of
Berlin, aircraft do a very impos-
ing job if not liable to serious
enemy interference. The Burma
air-lift would not have been
possible next door to the Luft-
waffe in its prime. But when it
comes to covering long sea
distances carriage is a job for
merchantmen, which, in turn,
can only be effectively defended
from ships in the vast spaces' of
the sea, because ships are the
only gun-platforms which can
be ever-present at the side of
ocean-going vessels.
Admiral Nimitz’s View
Admiral Nimitz declared in
his final message before retiring
from the Pacific Command;
Sir Walter Raleigh declared in the
early seventeenth century that “who-
soever commands the sea commands
the trade; whosoever commands the
trade of the world commands the
riches of the world, and consequently,
the world itself.”
The Admiral remarked that
“this principle is as true today
as when uttered, and its effects
would continue so long a$ ships
traverse the seas.”
And this is so. There can
be no attack against a distant
objective unless there is air and
naval command of the pipeline
to that objective and to its ap-
proaches. There can be no ex-
pansion or consolidation of
either land attack or of air sup-
port in a trans-ocean .war save
by the use of ships. Until air-
craft can be produced with tre-
mendous freighting-power and a
far more economical fuel-usage
and cost this condition must re-
main. Indeed, such is the growth
of mechanisation and conse-
quently of the bulk of impedi-
menta needed for overseas
attack that the need for ships in
modern warfare will be more
likely to increase than to de-
cline, whether shipping is used
for freightage, support in attack
or the keeping open of supply-
lines when attack is being built
up or defence developed.
An Apt Comparison
Admiral Nimitz in his final
report clinched his arguments in
the matter by remarking that
“the 100,000 long tons of cargo
which 44 ships can transport
from San Francisco to Australia
monthly would require for the
same purpose 10,000 four-
engined CB7 aircraft manned by
120,000 highly-trained personnel,
plus 89 sea-going tankers to pro-
vide gas along the route and at
the far end of the run.”
Admiral King, U.S. Com-
mander-in-Chief, viewing the
matter from the point of view
of striking forces, admitted that
“it is impossible for a fleet to
operate effectively without air
power of its own... .Our
superiority in carrier strength
has enabled us to take giant
strides across the Pacific in spite
of the enemy’s island network
of air bases.” But he made it
clear that success in air attack
was only possible through co-
operation of sea-power and air-
power :
The fast carrier task forces of the
Pacific Fleet, consisting of aircraft-
carriers, battleships, cruisers and
destroyers, have repeatedly made
bold offensive thrusts into distant
waters, inflicting significant damage
on the enemy’s shipping and instal-
lations. They have supported am-
phibious operations, controlling the
air both before and after landings
and until airstrips were completed.
.... The clearest evidence of their
effectiveness is seen in the box score
of damage inflicted upon the enemy
by Admiral Halsey’s Third Fleet be-
tween August 24, 1944, and January
26, 1945. During those five months,
while the Third Fleet was engaged
in supporting the Western Carolines
and the Philippine Island operations,
4370 enemy aircraft were destroyed,
82 enemy combatant ships sunk and
372 enemy auxiliaries and merchant
ships sunk, excluding small craft,
against a loss in combat by the Third
Fleet of only 449 of our own planes
and the light carrier Princeton.
Summed up, the situation
from a fighting point of view is
that in a wide ocean like the
Pacific or the Atlantic an air
force without a navy underneath
it is like a gun without a gun-
platform, and a merchant fleet
is like a Russian Commissar
without his bodyguard.
Practical Logistics
Anybody who sees a large-
scale war —as the British Gov-
ernment in recent years seems to
see it —without a navy at the
very root of its conduct need
only look at the logistics of
comparatively small but wide-
flung operations such as the
Lingayen Gulf landing to under-
stand how vital naval power re-
mains.
In that operation 1033 ships,
from battleships to landing-craft,
were used, with naval personnel
alone of 273,000 —a third more
than the army forces put ashore
during the first four days. At
Iwojima 800 vessels were used
with personnel of 220,000, and a
quarter of that 'number —
marines—were landed during
the first three days.
Admiral King’s dictum was
that “the experience of more
than three years of war has
demonstrated the soundness of
our concept of a balanced fleet
in which aircraft and ships work
together as a co-ordinated team.
There has been no dispute as to
carriers versus battleships. Air-
craft can do some thing which
ships cannot do. Ships can do
some things which aircraft can-
not do. Working together, sur-
face ships, submarines and air-
craft supplement each other so
that the strength of the unified
team is greater than the sum of
the parts.”
It will be many a year before
that conception is upset, atom
bomb or no atom bomb, guided
missile or no guided missile.
Berlin Impasse?
Airing of the acute Berlin dis-
pute before the U.N. Security
Council resulted in complete
futility as regards any influence
of the Council itself. At the end
of last week the chairman of the
Council sought, by adjournment,
to allow the major Powers a last
opportunity to find a settlement
among themselves.
Following the joint Note by
the three Western Powers to the
United Nations, calling for
action by the Security Council
to settle the menace to peace in
Russia’s blockade of Berlin, the
Council placed the matter on its
agenda, against protests by the
Soviet and Poland that the ques-
tion was not admissible to settle-
ment by any body except the
Council of Foreign Ministers.
A simultaneous Moscow reply
to the other members of the
Foreign Ministers’ Council re-
iterated the objection, along
with another spate of abuse and
misrepresentation, and suggested
a new Foreign Ministers’
Council meeting to consider
the Berlin question along
with that of Germany as
a whole. This is precisely what
the Allies recently refused to do,
and they still refuse it. They
demand that before any more
negotiations, in a quest already
proved fruitless, Russia shall lift
the illegal Berlin blockade.
Just as the motion was coming
before the Security Council,
Marshal Sokolovsky published
in Berlin a statement that
Russia was prepared t o
resume discussions “on the
basis of agreement in prin-
ciple reached between the
Western envoys and the Soviet
leaders in Moscow on August
30.” It was this agreement
which Sokolovsky has hitherto
refused, with Moscow’s tacit
approval, to take up. His offer
may have contributed to the
decision by the Security Coun-
cil’s temporary chairman to
adjourn the public debate. But
any further Russian prevarica-
tion at a Four-Power meeting
will surely be for the last time.
Elections Banned
In Berlin the Soviet authori-
ties have banned the municipal
elections due to be held on Nov.
14. It is, under ruling conditions,
safe to assume that the Russians
will permit no more elections in
the city while the Allies remain,
until, that is, the Russians can
manipulate the “voting.” It was
the Communists’ crushing defeat
at the Berlin municipal elections
in October, 1946, which decided
Moscow that propaganda alone
had failed them. From that time
forward the Russians began to
jettison every provision for co-
operation with the West in the
Potsdam Agreement for Four-
Power administration of the
city.
What Happens Next?
With the Security Council’s
adjournment to enable the chief
Powers an interval to explore
any last chance of private agree-
ment, a flicker of hope revives.
It seems quite clear that this is
the last chance. The Council
Stop Waving the thing about , Prendergast!”
itself can settle nothing while the
Big Four are divided, for the
veto of one of them can defeat
any proposal. If the Security
Council has to confess impo-
tence, the debate will be trans-
ferred to the General Assembly,
where the bitter exchanges be-
tween Russia and the Western
Powers over failure of agreement
for control of atomic weapons
has already reflected the sultry
atmosphere everywhere else. If
members of this body, too, must
come out by the same door as in
they went, there will be little
left of anything united among
the United Nations except the
general conviction of the demo-
cratic States that the Soviet and
its satellites are a misfit in
U.N.O. or any other peace-seek-
ing society.
If Russia refuses in this last
stage of the “cold-war” to make
any agreement possible, then at
most a certain further short
period will have been won for
preparation by all the Western
nations to meet any open rup-
ture.
The declaration by the Ameri-
can delegate to the Security
Council, that the United States
is prepared to take any measure
necessary to stay in Berlin, and
that it will not surrender its
rights before any threat of force,
was endorsed by Britain, and
draws the line finally and firmly.
The “threat of force” from
Moscow is aggravated by its
widespread aircraft and para-
chute operations in the air-traffic
corridors.
The Truth About
Defence.
The truth about Australian
defence at the moment cannot
be cloaked by any blustering
prevarication by Mr, E. J. Ward
about the Brisbane Line, which
he invented himself, or by the
specious mouthings of Messrs.
Dedman and Riordan. Their
claims that they are spending five
times as much on defence as was
spent in 1939 need to be viewed
in the light of the fact that they
and their party fought tooth and
nail against any organised de-
fence at all in 1939 except “300
aeroplanes,” which their leader
declared could be “bought for
the price of one battleship,” thus
securing Australia from all in-
vasion ! It also has to be viewed
in the light of the knowledge
that it now takes 10 civilians in
the defence departments to do
the work of one in 1939, and
that the obsolescent light escort
aircraft-carriers which the Gov-
ernment has bought at a cost of
£5,000,000 each would have been
dear before 1939 at a quarter of
the money.
General Brett’s Views
The management of defence
is, in fact, exactly in the same
position in which General Brett,
of the U.S. Army, found it at
the beginning of 1942, and the
Government can scarcely depre-
cate General Brett as a critic,
because it was he, and not
General MacArthur, as is now
claimed, whom the Curtins,
Fordes and Wards demanded as-
Supreme Commander in the
South-west Pacific.
General Brett declared:
The politicians not the Army —
were running things in Australia and
giving us as many headaches as the
Japs. The Labor Government seemed
more interested in keeping to the
party line on wages, hours and work-
ing conditions than in the threat
posed by Japanese then on the other
side of the Owen Stanley Ranges.
He said that the Army was
under control of Mr. Forde,
who had “no military know-
ledge.” Mr. Drakeford, “presi-
dent of a railroad union who
knew nothing about the air,”
had control of air defence and
commercial aviation—it is a pity
the General did not know some
other “Labor” Defence Ministers,
beside whom Messrs. Forde and
Drakeford were swashbuckling
warriors.
Moreover, the American com-
mand found the conglomeration
of walking delegates for the
Communist - led unions who
called themselves a Government
to be already in a state of de-
feat :
They seemed to believe nothing
could stop the Japanese from even-
tually setting foot in Australia and
that offensive action was completely
out of the question.
Senator Cameron’s Record
There is one thing about Aus-
tralian “Labor,” and that is that
it is consistent. Its attitude today
is just as abject, cowardly and
disgraceful as it was when its
defence policy was framed in
1921 at the conference which in-
troduced the socialisation ob-
jective to which Mr. Chifley
clings, and the party has now
reaffirmed.
Its military policy then was
adopted on the report of a “mili-
tary committee,” and was
adopted without dissent by the
delegates of 170-odd unions, in-
cluding Mr. Drakeford, Mr.
Beasley, Mr. Holloway and
other present Cabinet Ministers
on the resolution of Senator
Cameron, now Postmaster-
General : —-
This Congress, believing that the
operation of the Defence Act re 70
days’ training of compulsory trainees
is unduly harsh and morally degrad-
ing, enters its emphatic protest, and
calls upon the Administration to im-
mediately cancel the same.
What kind of a Ministry is it
whose members pronounced it
“morally degrading” to defend
one’s country!
Eureka!
“Orion”: If, as Vyshinsky
and his Polish yes-man, Manuil-
sky, have conveyed at U.N.0.,
Russia can now make atom
bombs, the fact will soon be
confirmed. Those scientists in
Britain and America who have
obtained a little brief publicity
by demanding that there shall be
no secrecy in scientific re-
searches will be matched by
others behind the Iron Curtain,
who will gladly go to jail or the
Arctic forced - labor camps
rather than accept a ban by
Moscow against their publica-
tion of their discoveries to the
whole world. And the Com-
munists in every democratic
country, including Australia,
will applaud the individual stand
for the free distribution of scien-
tific intelligence and condemn
the Soviet Government for try-
ing to suppress it. Or will
they?
Another happy result should
be that the Russians and quasi-
Russians from the Eastern bloc
will cease their wailings about
anxiety in face of the West’s
alleged aggressive designs based
on advantage in possession of
atomic weapons—designs clearly
to be deduced from the arrogant
Western blockade of Berlin’s
supplies by the generous Rus-
sians.
Last year, simultaneously
with reports that the Russians
were about to produce atom
bombs, information reached
American intelligence, through
a priest who had returned from
the Ukraine, of an explosion
which blew up the promising
factory plant and most of those
in it. There was never any con-
firmation of this unhappy event
—the only propaganda value of
which could have been to provide
an excuse for delay in arriving
at results by scientists who, being
Russian, outclass all others.
Vyshinsky’s latest boast is,
strangely enough, also accom-
panied by rumors of serious ex-
plosions—in Siberia this time.
Another alibi? Or can another
gang of scientists who do not be-
lieve that their discoveries
should be concealed as national
secrets have purged themselves
in anticipation of their certain
fate as soon as their scientific
scruples should become known
to the Soviet authorities?

62 YEARS OF SERVICE
TO THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC
Ancestors of
an
industry
Edward Turner \ an Englishman, was the
first chemist to determine accurately the atomic
weights of lead, chlorine, silver, barium, mercury
and nitrogen—all substances of great scientific and
industrial importance. The atomic weight of any
element is the weight of an atom of it compared
with that of one-sixteenth of an atom of oxygen.
Accurate knowledge of atomic weights is inval-
uable. It enables analytical chemists to calculate
the quantities of various elements present in a com-
pound, chemical works’ managers to forecast the
probable yield of a manufacturing process, and
metallurgists to assess the value of an ore. Turner
was born in Jamaica in 1796, but came to Scotland
as a youth to read medicine at the University of
Edinburgh, later proceeding to the Continent to
study chemistry. Returning to Britain, he became
a chemical lecturer at Edinburgh in 1824. Shortly
afterwards he published his “Elements of
Chemistry," which became one of the standard
chemical text-books of the period. In 1828 he was
appointed Professor of Chemistry at University
College, London, but held this distinguished ap-
pointment for only a few years, as he died in 1837,
just after reaching his fortieth birthday. In the'
eyes of his contemporaries. Turner
was pre-eminently a great chemical
teacher, but his more lasting reputa-
tion rests on his meticulous accuracy
as an experimenter.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Concluding a spring meeting
throughout which the A.J.C. had poor
luck with the weather, Saturday’s
programme at Randwick was run
under perfectly vile conditions. Be-
tween torrential downpours, one of
which nearly washed out the meeting
after the second race, racegoers swel-
tered in a humid heat and fought a
losing battle with a minor plague of
small airborne insects.
Rim before the cloudburst, the
Canonbury Stakes and Widden Stakes
proved consolation prizes for the un-
lucky runners of the Breeders’ Plate
and Gimcrack Stakes respectively.
Third in the Breeders’ after having
been slow to find his legs, Aqua Regis
(W. Cook) led all the way to win
the Canonbury by eight lengths.
Pantomime (J. Thompson), third in
the Gimcrack after missing the start,
won the Widden comfortably, clock-
ing 60sec. for the five furlongs; Aqua
Regis had taken a second longer.
Aqua Regis is a handsome and well-
developed bay colt by Midstream
from the champion mare Amiable.
Pantomime is a chestnut filly by Ajax
from the Gimcrack-winner Ajixa.
As the times indicate, the track was
excellent for the two-year-old events;
then came the storm, and by the time
the Clibborn Handicap was run, get-
ting on for half an hour late,
the three-year-olds took 2.12 V to
cut out 10 furlongs. Because of his
four long white socks the Midstream
colt Snowstream (E. Doon) would be
eyed askance by many punters. How-
ever, by the time he’d returned from
soundly trouncing Count Cyrano,
Freedom and others in the mud
there wasn’t much white to be seen.
Looking as fat as the mud in which
he frolicked, old Silver Link (W.
Cook) finally managed to win a de-
cent race, in taking the Randwick
Plate of two miles at standard w.f.a.
Conditions of the Plate provided that
the prize may, at the Committee’s
discretion, be halved if the race is
not run in 3.35 or better, which seems
lenient enough. In Saturday’s slush,
however, they took 3.37 L The sur-
prise of the race was the fine staying
performance of the four-year-old
Harinero horse Bolivia, beaten only
a half-head by the winner and well
clear of the minor-placegetter Dark
Marne. Apart from the game man-
ner in which he ran, Bolivia, with
9st. under the w.f.a. scale, carried
a good 201 b. more than he has been
accustomed to. He is weighted
7.1 for the Melbourne Cup.
There were five starters in the Plate,
which is if anything, above average
for thai race. It was surprising how-
ever that only a like number should
have started in the six-furlongs Ches-
ter Handicap, and still morei surpris-
ing that the well-performed Star Vite
(E. Doon) should have been the rank
outsider at 10 to 1; m fact, twelves
were easily obtainable. The speedy
Temeraire, having his first run after
a 12 months’ spell, was a hot favorite,
but couldn’t handle the going; having
disputed the lead with Shading to
the turn, he dropped right out. It
looked like Shading and Cognac fight-
ing things out until Star Vite, who
must have made up fully a dozen
lengths in the final two and a halt
furlones flew up the outside to win
interfiling finish. With Shading
second, the margins were a half-head
and a half-neck.
Before he died a few months back,
Dudley Allsop expressed high hopes
of winning the Metrop. with Cardinal
Colour. The Mildura gelding missed
out in the big race after leading to
the turn, but with a light weight m
Saturday’s mud, won by six lengths
the Waverley Handicap over the same
iourney. Steady and Plausible were
in the places and the winner was
ridden by apprentice J. Lordan. the
10-furlongs Final Handicap saw jockey
Noel McGrowdie break a run of well
over 100 losing mounts by winning
on the 33-to-l chance Roatora.

Since the only two favorites suc-
cessful at Caulfield on Saturday were
odds-on propositions, punters had a
lean time; however, Derby and Caul-
field Cup form was there to be
studied. Rain set in early in the
afternoon and the track was soon
soft and cut about without being
really heavy.
With the Caulfield Cup to be run
next Saturday, the New Zealand visitor
Howe (H. Badger) chose just the
right time to show form on par with
his handsome appearance by winning
the Herbert Power Handicap over the
Cup distance. It was in every way
an ideal Cup trial. Howe carried
9.2 and drops to 8.10 for the Cup;
after being second-last early he
finished stylishly to beat Saxonian by
a couple of lengths and he cut out
the trip in the good time of 2.30.
Beau Robert, early favorite for the
Caulfield Cup, finished fourth behind
Black Beau.
A son of Defoe (sire of Defaulter
and other good horses), Howe is a
fine big coppery chestnut, very closely
resembling, other than in color, Phar
Lap. Most of his wins in New Zea-
land have been around eight and ten
furlongs, though last season he
finished first in the two-miles Auck-
land Cup, only to be relegated to
third place after a couple of pro-
tests had been considered. In that
race Howe carried 8.6 and ran the
testing distance in 3.22 3/5.
Another good Cup prelim, was that
returned by the very consistent mare
Saxony (J. Gilmore), starting at the
surprisingly good odds of 25 to 1
to win the mile Toorak Handicap.
Most folk considered the distance too
short for her, since only a week or
so back she had started favorite and
won a 12-furlongs race on the same
course. In the Toorak, Saxony
finished full of running to down
“Whacko! The second leg of my long-shot double just
romped home !”
Hororata and Solvive. She carried
7.10 and has 7.5 in the Cup.
Connections of Phoibos must be
whipping the cat that they did not
have a crack at the A.J.C.’s £lO,OOO
Derby. Certainly their colt should
give Carbon Copy, Vagabond and
the others something to think about
in the Victorian classic. On Satur-
day Phoibos added the mile Caulfield
Guineas to his impressive run of
wins, making an exhibition of
Ellerslie, Riptide and other fairish
performers. As expected, Riptide set
the pace, but, as they entered the
run home, it was obvious that
Phoibos, with Breasley sitting him
quietly behind the leaders, could win
whenever, and by as much as, he
liked. With Phoibos and Carbon
Copy both of his get, the imported
stallion Helios will certainly be well
represented in the Derby.
Showing that he lacks nothing of
the speed of his full-brothers Comedy
Prince and Comic Court, the two-
year-old St. Comedy (O. Phillips)
comfortably won the first Debutant
Stakes for colts and geldings, cover-
ing the four furlongs in 47isec. to
beat Tartan Crest and Greek Legend.
Wingflyer (F. King) took a fraction
longer to account for Birdman and
Patron in the second Debutant, while
Adela, a Midstream filly ridden by
D. Barclay, also clocked 48sec. in
winning the Debutante Stakes for
fillies. Bruin (W. A. Smith) won the
Tola Welter, starting at 10 to 1.
* * * *
Game and tough though Epsom-
winner De La Salle is, a 101 b. penalty,
bringing her weight to 8.8, and the
amount of hard racing she has had,
may stop her in the Cup; moreover,
she is an unknown quantity at 12
furlongs. The most likely prospects
for the Cup appear to be the two
“Gems” and Howe and Saxony, with
De La Salle too good to be com-
pletely ignored and Fresh Boy a pos-
sible surprise packet. So, for the
Caulfield Cup:
Royal Gem, 1; Howe, 2; Saxony,
3; Beau Gem, 4.
For Randwick (before acceptances):
Youthful Stakes: Aqua Regis, 1;
Grand Applause, 2; School Days, 3.
Novice: Sir Falcon, 1; Panstar, 2;
Benvolo, 3. George Herdsman Stakes:
Star Vite, 1; Slander, 2; Earl Pen-
theus, 3. Three-year-old Handicap:
Bold Duke, 1; Persist, 2; Cragside,
3. City Tattersall’s Gold Cup:
Titanic, 1; Silver Link, 2; Yamboon,
3. Club Welter: Newborough, 1;
Granite, 2; Mintage, 3.

Sydney G.P.S. athletes had to con-
tend with rain and mud at their
annual combined athletic champion-
ships, but still managed to knock
spots off a few records, which was
more than could be said of their four-
footed friends operating a few hun-
dred yards away at Randwick. D.
Watts of, Scots repeated his success
of last year in landing the sprinting
treble—looyds. in 10.8 sec., 220yds.
in 22.25ec., and 440yds. in SO.lsec.,
the last-named a new record. J•
Engel, of Grammar, landed a double
of not usually associated events in
taking the high jump (sft. llijn.)
and shot putt (42ft. sin.). Another
record went west when R. Burke, of
High, flipped over the 120yds. hurdles
in ll.Ssec. With the help of Watts’s
fine treble Scots won the senior
championship.

Seven under par for 27 of the
second 36 holes of his match against
Pickworth at Huntingdale (Mel-
bourne), Ferrier “cantered in” 10 up
and 9 to play. Pickworth had beaten
him at the 73rd in their Lakes (Syd-
ney) match.
Thus far in Sydney this season the
weather has been more suitable for
aquatic pursuits than cricket. After
two rounds only, Cumberland and
University have full scalps to their
belts, and Marrickville has a win
and a tie; there have been seven
drawn games. On Saturday most of
the teams spent the afternoon in the
pavilions, no doubt composing poems
to spring.
Getting ready for the first-class
matches, N.S.W. cricket selectors last
week sorted out 21 players to prac-
tise for the opening clash v. Queens-
land at Brisbane on Nov. 26. Of
the four “new bloods” R. Relton
(Waverley) and E. Thew (Uni.) will
strengthen the Ma State bowling. To
these will be added the six ’Waters
in the returning Australian XI. In
addition a batch of 22 “Colts” have
been chosen for the lesser inter-State
clashes. The matches in Sydney and
Brisbane this season will begin at
11 a.m. and end at 5.30.

Melbourne’s 13.11-7.8 win over
Essendon in the V.F.L. “grand final”
astounded the 50,000 or so who turned
up—a lot stayed away believing it
was a “sitter” for the Dons. Ground
and ball were greasy and Melbourne
used their weight freely, going to a
6.2-0.3 lead and thereafter doing
pretty much as they liked. Essendon
really lost the premiership on the
previous Saturday when they kicked
the awful score of 7.27 and allowed
Melbourne to make it a draw. It’s
been a great season for the V.F.L.,
and everybody now awaits the finan-
cial statement.
In the V.F.A. “grand final,”
watched by about 15,000, Brighton
beat Williamstown, 13.16-13.7.

Following the near-Donnybrook at
Ilkley between Australian Rugby
Leaguers and Castleford, when four
players were ordered off, and which
Tom Goodman, of “5.M.H.,” de-
scribed as “the most foul affair I
have seen in 30 years of football
reporting,” the tourists kept their
tempers under control in the first
Test at Leeds, but went down by
23 points to 21; at half-time Eng-
land led by 11-6. England’s tally
was made up of seven tries and one
goal—a poor effort by the hooters;
Australia got five tries and three goals.

Ray Coleman (8.13) decisively de-
feated Johnny Davis on points at
Leichhardt, though the mob hooted
referee Art Mawson’s very sensible
interpretation of the no-foul rule.
Coleman dropped Davis with a low
left in round eight, and Mawson,
cutting the round short, ordered both
boys back to their corners. Davis
fought harder than ever after a few
minutes’ rest, but Coleman was always
the better as well as the busier boxer
and won beyond question.


ABORIGINALITIES
Mat s Mate”: The reformer, a skinny
bloke with a whine in his voice, hit our
Gippsland-road job, made sure we were
all unionists and proceeded to enlighten
us on the evils of the capitalist system
and the power that lay within our reach.
At first we admired his handling of big
words, but soon we realised that he was
repeating them from booklets and
pamphlets, like a parrot that knows not
the sense of what it says. Somehow he
got the notion that Mat was about the
most promising convert among us and
began to concentrate on him. “How many
years you bin toilin’?” “Aw, I dunno,”
said Mat vaguely. “An’ what have y’ got
out of it?” Mat was as vague about that.
“An’ look at y’,” he went on. “Y’ work
like a bloomin’ horse for a miserable
pittance. Y’ expend the interest of y’r
strength an’ don’t draw no capital; y’re
just a prawn in the capitalist conspir-
iarchy—a scurf o’ Mammal an’ all his
works. Why do y’ work so hard? Why?”
Mat looked up, and I saw the old gleam
in his eye. “Well, I dunno,” he drawled.
“I reckon it must be because it’s such a
blasted relief when knock-orf time
comes.” And another reformer was
swamped in the laughter of the ignorant.

“Sth.E.”: Mopokes, wagtails, bats,
possums, tarantulas and a few others are
always particularly active on the nights
I drag my bunk on to the verandah, but
this time they were swamped to mere de-
tails by a mob of sheep. Being full
moonlight, the woollies gathered round
the house to mop up the grass where
they wouldn’t venture in daylight when
the dogs were loose. They all had
lambs. Some had lost them back at the
gap, some merely mislaid them en route
round the buildings, while the remainder
had evidently parked theirs within rea-
sonable bellowing distance, where they
could check their whereabouts at regu-
lar short intervals. Nothing else being
possible, I listened to the calls, and soon
I picked up the language. No two ewes
sounded exactly alike, and even the
lambs differed in some small degree of
pitch or strength. Later, as they
quietened, I tried, through timing and
repetition, to pick the lambs belonging to
particular ewes. Ewes and lambs, it
seems, should have no trouble at all locat-
ing each other by sound. Only trouble
with their system, it should have more
“I’m coming ; where are you?” technique
and less of the long-winded “No ; you
c’mere” argument.

“L. de F.”: The wind was almost gale
force, and I was surprised to see dust on
the road ahead, for it had only just
stopped raining. Drawing nearer I saw
that it was coming down from the line
of roadside trees —pollen it was, from a
belt of Pinus insignis, the “insignificant”
pine of California which grows to such
a superior tree in some other climates, as
here in southern Victoria. The trees were
lit with tapers of new growth, but their
whole outline was blurred with the swirl-
ing clouds of yellowish pollen-dust. Had
there been a balance of soulmates for
the pollen there must have been billions
of potential trees in the air. But these
pines seldom set a heavy crop of cones.
Birds, rats and possums, rabbits and
drought take toll of what does mature.
Next year the yield will perhaps be less
than a dozen self-sown seedlings.

“Muskeen”: I doubt whether that
snake would have been held prisoner in
that bottle-swallow’s nest until he had
digested his prey (B. 29/9/’4B). At Elsey
Station (N.T.) we found it impossible to
keep tame lorikeets because of snakes
swallowing them in their cages at night.
After his meal Joe, finding himself in the
bulging predicament, would thrust a
figurative, finger down his throat, bring
up his supper and make off elsewhere for
a replacement.

“Rawhiti”; “Young Slim” might not
have been so keen to sample kava-kava
(B. 15/9/’4B) had he seen it .being
brewed. The root of, the cassava-plant
is collected, washed and shredded into a
long wooden trough. The village belles
are the brewers. At least six ’teenagers
are chosen for their good teeth and good
looks —they squat down alongside the
shredded root and, placing handfuls in
their mouths, commence to masticate it
thoroughly, spitting the chewed-up q|£ss
into another wooden trough placed along-
side. The chewed-up root is then covered
with water and allowed to ferment.
Apparently the saliva has some effect
“Come on, you blokes, give us a hand or We'll never get there."
on the quick fermentation. The kava-
kava is finally clarified with a palm-leaf
and is then ready for use. The correct
way to take kava-kava is a small mouth-
ful of kava and straight away a big
mouthful of food —the results then are
not quite so disastrous, but all the same
it is a wicked drink.

“M.S.”: “Shamuseen’s” dipsomaniac
rainbow-birds (B. 15/9/’4B). must share
the laurels of intemperance with the Swift
parrot. This little green-and-red beauty
gets so sozzled on nectar at times that it
falls out of its tree. But the feathered
inebriate, like his human counterpart, is
at the mercy of the law —in the former
case Nature’s law. The policeman who
enforces it is too often a prowling cat.

“E.C.8.M,”; “Dekko’s” statement (B.
29/9/’4B) that the name Baalbek means
the Place of Baal is not quite accurate.
The word bek is derived from a Canaanite
root, bki (=Hebrew bkh), which refers to
weeping, and so Baalbek is probably
more or less equivalent to “Baal weeps”
or, more likely, the Baal of Weeping.
Reference would then be to the Canaanite
version of the Tamnluz-Adonis cult which
was popular around this area in early
times ; in fact, the Temple of Jupiter was
probably erected, following the usual
Roman custom of religious synthesis,
upon a far more ancient holy site. Adonis
—the Baal of the Canaanite cults—was a
young man accidentally killed while hunt-
ing ; his life, poured out on the ground in
the form of blood, fertilised the soil, and
the anniversary of his death was cele-
brated by ritual weeping.

“Hannans St.”: It takes a surprising
quantity of wood even to burn a man’s
body (B. 15/9/’4B). Was once present
outside Kalgoorlie at the obsequies of a
’Ghan —they were all ’Ghans to citizens
of the W.A. goldfields, though some had
the religious distinction of being cremated,
whilst others were merely buried. Any-
way, to get this particular deceased suc-
cessfully over the Styx his brethren had
on hand a double-drayload of dry salmon-
gum, possibly the most highly calorific
timber in Australia. This load, sufficient
to serve an average wood-stove family
for upwards of six months, just sufficed
to do the job, most of the incineration
being done by the big bed of red coals
that resulted when the pyre burned down.
Sq much being required makes me some-
what sceptical of the alleged end of Hitler
and his Eva. According to an account
in William Shirer’s End of a Berlin Diary
Adolf and the lady were cremated on
open ground just outside of the bunker
in the Berlin Chancellory, 180 litres of
petrol, the whole supply available, being
used. A litre being reckoned at a trifle
over a quart, the amount at the outside
would be no more than 50 gallons, and
there would be no bed of coals. Inside
an oven 50 gallons might suffice, but in
the open air? I doubt it.

“Bughouse”; Tell “G’snatcher” (B.
18/8/ ’4B) that I remain unmoved even
when smitten with the Twentieth Century
Dictionary, latest edition. Light is all the
dictionary defines —and something more.
For instance, isn’t the X-ray light? But
it doesn’t affect the organs of sight or
render visible the objects from which it
proceeds. And just as it. took. civilised
man at least 3000 years to uncover the
X-ray, there may still be other invisible
rays yet to be discovered. More, the
X-ray, being a form of light capable of
affecting a sensitised plate (photographic),
will not only penetrate a brick wall of
reasonable thickness, but will also pene-
trate steel. Professor Piccard, testing the
cast-steel sphere in which he hopes to
reach the bottom of mid-ocean, used the
X-ray, and discovered a large blowhole
deep in the casting which might have
brought disaster under the pressure of a
mile or two of water. I admit readily
that the eye, long confined in a pitch-
dark dungeon, finds sight with the rays
emanating from the dungeon walls—that
is, from light slowly seeping down into
the earth. But I have found that visible
light has difficulty in getting around
corners. Dropping down a pit, one loses
all visible light at 200 ft., simply because
the light around the top of the pit falls
at an angle ; the rays can’t bend suffi-
ciently to reach any great distance down.
Those medieval engineers knew this and
so designed their dungeons that light
did not find its way in with air.

“Telarb”; “Laetitia’s” reference (B.
25/8/’4B) to “dusky clerks in holy orders”
still holds good in Torres Strait today.
Two fully-ordained C. of E. islanders are
at present in charge of parishes on the
Strait. Poi Passi, a son of Idriess’s Passi,
ministers to the souls of the Murray
Islanders, whilst Kebay Pilot is spiritual
adviser to St. Paul’s and Kubin village
(on Moa) and Badu. There are half a
dozen clerks in the training college at
Thursday Island doing a course under the
Administrator (Rev. Bennie). Some are
due for deacon’s orders this year. The
islanders hold a very healthy respect for
their barefooted brothers of the cloth, and
Kebay and Poi do a fine job. During the
war Kebay assumed full spiritual
responsibility for the whole of the Strait.

“B. A. Ker”: Can’t say that I’ve ever
regarded jarrah as a softwood (B.
25/8/’4B), although I’d rather chop it
than some timbers I know-—curly-grained
yellow-box, for instance. Actually,
jarrah is regarded, in the building trade
especially, as one of the hardest of the
hardwoods. It is this hardness and dur-
ability, combined with its distinctive
reddish-brown color when sanded and
polished, that make Westralian jarrah
highly esteemed for ornamental floors on
the opposite side of the continent. Inci-
dentally, timber experts claim that the
building trade’s loose grouping of timbers
into two classes, hardwood and soft-
wood, is misleading. The contention is
based on the fact that our “hardwoods”—
ironbark, redgum, blackbutt, jarrah,
brushbox, etc. —are “pored” woods (not
to be confused with “porous”), while the
various pines, not having such growth-
cells or pores, are “non-pored” woods.
But balsa, probably the lightest and one
of the softest woods known, is a “pored”
wood; therefore, to be consistent, we
should class it a “hardwood,” which, of
course, would be the height of incon-
sistency. To return to “Gravelsnatcher”
and his difficulty in driving nails into dry
jarrah: I’ve found that by jabbing the
points into a piece of soap the mortality-
rate among the nails is reduced to about
5 p.c. When no soap is available strop
the nail on the greasy sweat-band of the
old working Stetson before driving—then
it will go through as easily as a bill rais-
ing politicians’ salaries.

“No. 1 Bench”: That picture by Such
(B. 15/9/’4B) of bread being sliced with
the big circular-saw isn’t so far-fetched
—l’ve seen hundreds of loaves sliced
up on the band-saw. At one town-
mill where I snatched a crust, literally,
when the bread-sawing was on, the boss
delighted in obliging the Red Cross
workers and others. And the odd thing,
bread could be sliced thinner with the
band-saw than it could be with the
sharpest knife. Of course, the staler the
loaf the better it sliced, but even bread
just out of the oven that would have
crushed under a knife could be sliced to
wafer-thinness by the saw. The only
drawback was a certain loss in crumb,
though even these were saved and
donated to a certain laborer with six
children, who took them home to be
made into puddings.

“Sandplain”: A hundred years ago
Charles Darwin demonstrated the value
of the humble earthworm as a soil-
improver by breaking up both animal and
vegetable matter into humus, so valu-
able in promoting vegetable growth.
Earthworms, however, require a very
moist, practically wet, soil in order to
work ; so in the drier areas of the earth
Nature seems to have delegated the task
to the white-ant. Investigations have
shown that the termite, cursed though it
is for destructiveness, brings to the soil
considerable increases in phosphoric-
acid, potash, lime and nitrogen. In the
early days of selecting on the half-arid
W.A. wheatbelt knowledgeable land-
seekers always looked for country, mostly
sandplain, well riddled L>y the ant. They
knew that cultivation would soon root
out the termite, but the fertility that the
insects left behind would endure for many
seasons.

“Moyhu”: In a spur consisting almost
entirely of solid granite back of Pore-
punkah (Vic.) a colony of rabbits harking
back to rat ancestors (if gnawing ability
can be taken as a pointer) defies all
efforts to destroy or dislodge it. Secret
of the rodents’ success in overcoming re-
peated onslaughts upon their stronghold
is that the warren has been chewed
through into the very bowels of the spur
itself, a lair, remote from interference,
despite attacks by everything from
dynamite to gas. Failure of the
dynamite isn’t surprising, but inability
of the gas to do its job had us
puzzled till we discovered numerous cun-
ningly gnawed vents through which a
constant stream of sweet air flowed into
the honeycomb. Long immunity from
attack (traps are useless, too —they gnaw
through the metal like cheese) has re-
sulted in the evolution of a type distinct
from its earth-burrowing relation.

“Robbie”: Absurdities in supplies (B.
1/9/’48)? As storekeepers in a Victorian
town, near the S.A. border, we obtained
a kitchen-stove from Adelaide. It had
been made in Geelong, sent by train to
Melbourne, thence by boat to Adelaide.
A customer bought the stove, asked could
we deliver it to the railway for dispatch
to a Geelong address!

“Solitude”: Caught sight of Seventy-
fiver and the mong. searching in the gully
above the dam, and turned in that direc-
tion. The old bloke was sticking to the
open, while Blue concentrated on tus-
socks, trees and patches of cover. “Aw,
y’ silly cow, how c’d me pipe get in a
holler log?” Seventy fiver growled, and,
crestfallen, Blue withdrew his forward
end and went off to take a squint down a
rabbit-hole. Drawing a blank there, too,
he trotted along a ferny track, stopped to
sniff something, then, while he rubbed his
nose in the dirt, I retrieved the offending
object and returned it. Seventyfiver
heaved a sigh and felt for a bunch of
strings fastened to his belt. On one was
a tethered box of matches. On another
was his pocket-knife. Taking the end of
a third, he knotted it firmly round the
stem of his pipe. “Silly way to carry
your things,” I frowned at him. “No
wonder you lose them.” Seventyfiver
came up defensively. “Yair? Well, I’d
like t’ know any other way o’ keepin’
track of ’em,” he challenged, “with the
rotten pockets they put in things nowa-
days.”
THE BRUMBY STALLION.
He runs, unfettered and idle.
The lord of range and plain;
He knows not halter or bridle
Or chink of the hobble-chain;
He carries no driver’s whip-mark,
He has bent to no rider’s rein.
His realm is from river to river
With never a fence to bar;
The ranges are his for ever
And the fenceless fields afar;
He is one with the bitless breezes
And one with the moon and star.
He leads his mob in the morning
And shepherds them home at night;
His neigh is their instant warning,
His nicker their love’s delight;
He is guard of their noonday camping
And first in their headlong flight.
He gives them their strength and shyness,
He gives them their grace and speed;
He is their Royal
The Czar and King of his breed,
And none may share his kingdom
And none his path impede.
The bushmen riding the ridges
Have marked that stallion’s pride
As he leads them into the gidyas
With his beautiful loping stride,
And have sworn by the gods to take him
And yard and rope him and ride.
But many a dawn will waken
And many a night will fall
Ere that Lord of the Hills be taken,
If he ever be taken at all;
And none but the grandest rider
Will lead him out of a stall!

“Lim Limbu”: The best post-war job
in New Guinea has been the rebuilding
of the 93-mile Wau-Labu road. Laid
down by the Army during the war, it
provided the inland with the long-awaited
access road to the coast. But by the end
of 1946 it was a quagmire of broken
corduroy sections, buckled sheets of arc-
mesh and stagnant pools of water.
Erosion from the Markham River was
undermining the lower section of the road
and forcing a continuous retreat into
swamp-land. In the upper sections wash-
outs, breaks and landslides combined to
close the road to all traffic for weeks at
a time. By jeep it was a grinding, jolt-
ing journey with nothing to be seen save
a few dispirited natives hacking with
knives and sarifs at the bush roadside.
Officialdom, at last awake, got to work
and put to good use the tractors, graders,
shovels, scoops and trucks which the
kunai was threatening completely to
smother. Now, after 12 months’ work
the road is a scenic highway, smooth and
broad, and the country all the way
through lies open on each side. Also,
the pre-war air-freight rates from Lae
to Wau have been halved, and, with ade-
quate maintenance, safe and economic
transport in this area seems assured.
Weakest link is the barge section between
Labu and Lae, but this is to be by-passed
by the bridging of the Markham River
in the vicinity of Nadzab, war-time
R.A.A.F. base.

“Bo”; Simpson happened to be above-
ground when he heard the crash below
followed by a scream from Carr, who had
just gone down to see about strengthening
a weak section of the roof of the drive
of the small mine they were working.
During the next half-hour Simpson per-
formed prodigies of valor and endurance,
with the risk of a further fall to bury
them both ; but at the end of it, his hands
torn, his breath coming in great gasps,
he had succeeded in dragging his partner
out, uninjured except for a few bruises.
Just as they reached safety an avalanche
of earth and boulders crashed down on
the very spot where the trapped Carr had
lain. At the sound Carr, still white and
shaken, gave a shudder. Then a warm
glow of gratitude to his rescuer surged
over him. “Thanks a lot, Herb,” he said
fervently. “I won’t forget it. An’ touchin’
on that ten-bob you owe me, don’t worry
about it. Y’ve no need to pay me back
out o’ yer next military pension, Herb —

“Old-timer”: When the boss’s
daughter came up from her city board-
ing-school for a holiday she brought with
her an almost-grown Irish setter. It fell
out of the car at the homestead, slob-
bered all over the welcoming group,
wiped its mouth enthusiastically on a
back tyre and explored the garden. It
went through the back gate into the wide-
open spaces and was discovered by two
kelpies and a blue-heeler that happened
to be at home that day. None of the three
had ever seen a large, red animal of that
description before. The kelpies tried to
yard it and the blue dog challenged it to
fight. Suspicious of their intentions, the
big pup raced round behind the woolshed
and there collided with a score or so of
shorn ewes. Never having dreamt of such
creatures, it almost fainted, somehow got
clear and bolted back towards the home-
stead howling for help. But the humans
were inside all bubbling over the returned
daughter, and the only refuge the setter
could find was beneath the car. There
it lay, trembling, while the kelpies yipped
round the car and the heeler growled
threats and threw dirt about. Disturbed
by all this fuss, Smoky, the boss’s porcu-
pine, heaved himself out of a near-by
geranium and made for the soft earth and
sanctuary beneath the car. The station
dogs had tried conclusions with Smoky
before, and they withdrew, grinning
largely. The setter pup eyed this small
intruder with scorn. This was something
which, although outside his range of ex-
perience, was small enough to feel the
weight of his indignation. He grabbed at
Smoky. The shocking howl of the
punctured pet brought the whole family
forth, and it took them 10 minutes to
capture the frantic setter and pass him
over to his mistress for comfort and con-
solation.
“Guy Mopoke”: Shortly after old
Sugarloaf was buried at the Abo. Reserve
on the Upper Macleay, the tribe, plus all

they had abandoned the old camp, which
had good, comfortable huts. “Sugarloaf

“Spinet”: I don’t doubt “Betcha’s”
claim (B. 22/9/’4B) that foxes find under-

making off with one of the corpses. The
long-nosed fellow, ancient enemy of the
fowlyard, had dug straight and true to

middle of the doe’s spine. If you tell
me the skin was slit down the back leav-
ing the belly intact I won’t believe you
—that just isn’t done in the best Too-

“D.R.H.”: Last summer through the
heat of the day every bush on the flats
had its little group of shade-seeking
rabbits. In the winter trappers, .supplying
the freezing-plants set up at the sidings,
reduced the numbers within 20 or 30
miles of the line; but out in the ranges
and in the sandhills the bunny popula-
tions were as numerous as ever. In the
last month or so, however, rabbits have
suddenly become scarce in those outlying
localities. Local opinion favors migra-
tion, but as there is no news of any
district receiving an influx disease and
death seem more probable explanations.
Just around here every rabbit that I've
hacked open in the last two months has
presented a striking picture. The great
veins in the belly and the lesser vessels
in the mesenteries between the intestines
have all been swollen with blood. As the
“Reckon it's a photo.-finish.”
arteries are not engorged the evidence
points to a damming-back of the venous
circulation, either in the heart or in the
lungs. Opening the heart immediately
after death, before clotting occurs, one
finds small thrombi, yellow or yellow-
and-red bodies, adhering to the valves
where they have formed in an effort to
patch up damage caused by an invading
organism. In this position the patches
obstruct the flow of blood into the ven-
ticles, raising the venous pressure and
causing congestion. Judging by foxes and
cats examined, the condition seems to
be infectious.

“Übet”: Talking of noise and the
effect of its proximity to the human ear
(B. 15/9/’4B), in a cheap edition I’m still
wasting kero, on a couple of secret-ser-
vice blokes select a noisy-engined car as
the safest place to discuss secrets. With
the engine running they shout in each
other’s ears and get away with it, despite
the fact that enemies crowd them on all
quarters. Evidently the writer was not
aware that under the circumstances the
only ones that would have difficulty in
hearing would be those near the noise.
Have enjoyed many a grin listening to
the men at work alongside the engine in
a shed isolated some hundred yards or
more from the other buildings. On one
occasion it went like this: “Where’d the
fat-headed old so-and-so go to now,
Ted?” bawled a voice/ “Ain’t the cow
gonna bring up no flamin’ tea, I won-
der?” “Dunno,” came an answering bel-
low. “Mind he ain’t snoopin’ around.
Might hear y’.” A head appeared in the
shed doorway for an instant. “No, ’saw-
right,” the first voice again yelled above
the throbbing engine. “The blanky old
fossil’s down at the house. Knock orf ’n’
pray f’r a billy o’ tea, will y’?” Ten
minutes later I arrived back with their tea.

“Zake”: Murdoch was puzzled to see
Alan, his dopey new hand, take a
spadeful of earth he’d dug up from
Mum’s kitchen garden and go and toss it
over the wire-netting into the fowlyard.
On his second trip with the spade
Murdoch intercepted him. “What the
hell’s the idea, cluttering up the fowlyard
with that?” he asked. “You were told
to feed the fowls. It’s wheat they eat,
not worms.” “That’s awright,” said the
hand. “The missus said I could either

“Chuck”: Midgie’s toothache was out
of proportion to the rest of him, and as
the days passed with the little bloke still
complaining, the mob were hard put to
it thinking up fresh remedies to try out.
Then big Mike heard of an amateur
tooth-puller travelling through, and sent
word for him to call. Remembering
previous jaw operations, Midgie grew
restless. He mentioned a turn for the
better in the molar, and pointed out its
soundness and the inconvenience of losing
that particular one, but without avail,
After Mike had caught him the second
time sneaking over the ridge with his
lunch in his pocket, he appointed himself
chief bodyguard and eventually dumped
Midge on a chair before the touring
bloke. The first pull of the forceps
brought the patient to his feet. The
second attempt hauled him clean off the
chair. He was shoved back and a knee
planted in his middle. After several more
efforts, with Midgie’s head following the
forceps in every direction, the amateur
paused, considered the big molar, ran an
eye over Midge and turned thoughtfully
to Mike. “Got anything around we c’d
wedge that tooth still with?” he said
ponderingly. “Our best bet’ll be to shove
the tooth in the chair and pull the little
cove off it.”

“Propalong”: In these days when the
air is turbid with the moans of colic-
stricken “ce-owboys” one is apt to fear
that the old ballads of the real bush have
been swept away by a muddy flood of
Hollywoodese, mass-produced to irrigate
the parched souls of city mugs who never
saw a cow except on milk-tin labels. But
the other day we struck a camp on a S.A.
run west of Lake Torrens where the old
spirit still holds out. Old Jack had
finished his weekly washing, and, being
therefore in a good mood, held the floor
for an hour or so. He gave us “The
Man From Snowy River,” some “Salt-
bush Bill” and “The Bush Christening.”
Then he switched to Ogilvie, returned
again to Paterson, and wound up triumph-
antly with “Johnson’s Snakebite Anti-
dote.” Outside there was the bush silence
broken only by the “tink-tink” of a
distant horsebell; the mulga was black
in the starlight and a rocky hillcrest sharp
against the stars. With us, inside, were
a couple of blokes who had never heard
the old verses before. Somehow, when
old Jack had finished, they were very
silent, too.

“Narrin”: In the Middle Ages no
medical practitioner thought of opening
his butcher’s shop unless the premises had
been duly decorated with a few snakes,
lizards and toads. The blokes in the
Harley-street class aspired to a stuffed
crocodile, but the lesser reptiles, and, of
course, toads, were as essential as an
understanding with the local undertaker.
History being notoriously repetitive, one
was not surprised to read, a year or two
ago, that lady toads were again being
used by the doctors. Lately, however,
gentlemen toads have been pressed into
the service of clinical medicine, being
used in a pregnancy test that is described
as being “simple, economical and reli-
able.” It is supposed that a toadarium
will be a feature of every properly-
equipped surgery in the near future and
that phlebotomy and cauterisation will
return to everyday usage to complete the
cycle.

“Mozzer”: A tyro at beefarming,
Dan, on his block in the hills, had six
beehives along the bottom fence of the
orchard, and he always left himself a
20yd. start and a clear run. One day a

down for help. A neighbor came with
a smoke-gun, gave it a few puffs, broke
off the twig which held the bees, then
shook them into a box. He left the
smoke-gun and some advice for Dan to
build more hives. Three days later an-
other hive swarmed. Dan shrouded the
area in smoke, liberally dosed himself
for protection, lopped the whole branch
off and managed to get half the bees
into the box. After that the bees began
to swarm rapidly, so Dan frantically got
to work and built 20 hives and burnt
five potato-sacks in the smoke-gun. The
neighbor called, but on inspection found
only nine swarms existed, five of them in
new hives. Dan’s smoke and activity had
had the same bees swarming over and
over again.

“L. de F.”: Visiting English forester
Lord Robinson, stressing the importance
of timber, said recently that, had they
not been able to supply home-grown
timber for propping the coalmines, the
Battle for Britain might have been lost.
Over a century ago another forester,
Robert Monmeath, adviser to the then-
reigning sovereign, sought to stir the
nation’s conscience to England’s depleted
and neglected forests. “Were England at
war,” he said, “and imports stopped,
without proper timber this country, grown
great upon her stout oaken ships, might
be lost.” “Proper timber” was vital, for
shipcraft of that age demanded that the
great curved beams of a ship’s skeleton
should be grown curved, often expertly
trained so to grow. These forks —or
crooks, as they were called —were always
in short-supply andy fetched a much
higher price per foot than straight timber.
Monmeath had a contempt for “this new-
fangled idea” of steaming wood in the
kiln to bend to the right curve, “for
such makeshifts can never have the true
strength of natural-grown crooks. Many
a gallant ship with her crew has gone to
the bottom because, under stress of
storm, such bended timbers have sprung
and opened up the ship,” He begged
King and Parliament to witness the
country’s “constant need for honest
timber, for ever.” Well, doesn’t that still
stand today?.
FITZROY CAMPSITE.
Lost light lingers on the Razor Back
While new men travel down an ancient track
That leads to water and the floodgum trees
And the best stock campsite in the Kimberleys.
Stockmen slumber under stars that shine
On the Fitzroy River and the Condamine:
Tired night-horses at the break of day
And grey smoke rising to a sky dawn-grey.
Vague tracks straining over soil, stone, sand,
And a strange dog howling in the oldest land,
And an old-time story that the stones could tell
Of a Queensland river and a cattle bell.
Horsemen mounting and the mob’s away
(Dark dust rises from the Fitzroy clay).
Lead on, river, to the marsh-girt sea:
There’s a new sun rising over Kimberley.

THE WAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
The Future of Shearing.
“Bungaree”; Reports from
practically all the wool country
agree that the supply of shearing
labor has never been worse. It’s
attributed to many causes—good
prices for rabbitskins, good
wages and conditions in the
cities, etc. —but the fact remains
that the steady decrease in shear-
ing labor apparent for several
years has now reached the stage
when the pastoral industry will
have to tackle it urgently. The
shortage was aggravated in
N.S.W. by wet weather at the
beginning of the season, which
will affect shearing right through
the season as there was no
surplus of men to make new
teams to catch up on the lag.
But actual delay in shearing
is by no means the most im-
portant feature. The manpower
shortage inspires continuous
blackmail by militant shearers,
who want additional privileges
such as rebates of tax, free meat,
fares, etc., no matter how favor-
able the award rates are. The
sheep-owner has to put up with
rough shearing and a standard
of behavior that should not be
foierated, and the only remedy is
to train more shearers.
Under the latest award the
proportion of learners to shearers
has been increased, but unless
this is faithfully followed we will
be no further ahead. There is
far too much selfishness and too
little co-operation. More men
are applying for learner’s pens
than can be accommodated, and
there are many difficulties in the
way of teaching learners.
The learner’s f|rst require-
ments are to learn how to handle
the machine, to get used to the
vibration, and how to hold the
sheep. These things could be
taught at crutching-time, when
spare pens are available and
more time for instruction. Local
organisations could organise
teams of learners. Alternatively
or as a follow-on to the crutch-
ing instruction, why not allot
(say) two or more pens in each
shearing-shed for tuition of
learners and engage twice the
number of learners for which
there are pens available? Half
the learners would shear for one
run, the other half would work
as shedhands, and thus, by work-
ing in alternate runs only, would
be able to stand up to the work
better. The A.W.U. doesn’t
favor this, but the question
should be reopened.
Melbourne Beef Sales.
“Mr.”: Contrasting strongly
with the record sales and prices
at Sydney and Brisbane, Mel-
bourne Show beef sales were the
dullest for years. More than
half the small offering of 96 head
were passed in, the remainder,
41 head, selling for an aggre-
gate of £7OOO.
Aberdeen-Angus had the best
sale, though 23 of the 40 sub-
mitted failed to find buyers.
Kahlua Pastoral Co.’s (N.S.W.)
Kahlua Maori Pah, by Elusid
of Balfron, went to Don Dennis,
of Terang (Vic.), for 350gns.
Two two-year-old heifers from
Narrangullen (N.S.W.) brought
275gns. These were Narran-
gullen Eppie Third and Grata
Second, and went to Mrs. E.
Dennis, Nambrok (Vic.), and F.
L. Watts, Heidelberg (Vic.),
respectively. The reserve cham-
pion bull, Booroomooka Quartz,
was sold privately to J. C. Wil-
son, Camperdown (Vic.)," for'
500gns.
Seven of the 12 Herefords
offered changed hands. The
bulls averaged 192gns., the top
price of 400gns. going to R. L.
McEachern, Strathdownie (Vic.),
for Ardno Sunbeam Fourth,
Elder Smith (Perth) the buyer.
The only four polled Hereford
cows offered went to Adelaide
buyers. Goldsbrough Mort
bought The Braes Purity 25th
(240gns.) and The Braes Wara-
tah 10th (160gns.). R. Coombe,
Adelaide, paid 135gns. for The
Braes Waratah 16th.
Of the 35 Shorthorns offered
only 12 were sold —nine bulls
and three heifers. The bulls re-
turned the mediocre average of
88gns. and the heifers 201gns.,
a figure not even as good as it
looks, for one of the three,
Coombing Mermaid Fourth,
brought top price of the sale—
510gns. The heifer, which ap-
parently took the fancy of her
purchaser,' C. P. Fairbairn,
Woomargarma (N.S.W.), was
female champion of the breed,
Whitney Pastoral Co. (N.S.W.)
bred her.
Stoppage of Wheel-spin.
“Kismet”: Has someone been
blowing down “Nubis’s” ear
(B. 18 /8 / ’48)? Perhaps his rea-
son for inflating tractor tyres to
only 75 p.c. of water (or
just above the valve-level) is be-
cause it would be impossible for
him to do otherwise- under his
existing method, as the tyre
would burst under the water
and air pressure if an endeavor
were made to force the tyre to
100 p.c. water.
J. Pointing and W. Sullivan,
tractor mechanics respectively at
Gatton College and Too-
woomba, say 100 p.c. water is
sound tractor-tyre practice:
Says Pointing: A few weeks ago
Mr. Moran demonstrated a tractor-
tyre water-filler, made by Kismet
Engineering Works, Coorparoo, at
Gatton College. The driver of the
U-model Twin City tractor at the
college tells me that the performance
of this tractor has been considerably
“pepped up” by the use of 100 p.c.-
water-filled tyres. This gives me great
confidence in “pushing” this filler.
Says Sullivan; I have made a
check as to, how long I have been
filling tyres with 100 p.c. water. The
first was on July 9, 1946. This tractor
has all tyres filled 100 p.c. and I have
been doing 100 p.c. filling ever since.
During the past 12 months or so I
have not been filling the front tyres.
The filling of the front tyres is only
necessary when skidding is experienced
on corners while turning, or to re-
move the excessive bounce on rough
roads or paddocks. This 100 p.c.
filling does not. make the tyres solid,
provided each is inflated. to the cor-
rect pressure. It is advisable to keep
to the minimum pressure rather than
the maximum. The pressure varies in
accordance with the weight of the
tractor and the load it is pulling.
Filling tyres 100 p.c. with water and
keeping as close as possible to the
“Are y ’ sure it ain't only just a touch o' calf-love , doc .?”
minimum pressure, .and the tyre hav-
ing a fair amount of elasticity, makes
it far from being a solid tyre. I have
not had a single complaint of 100
p.c. water being in any way detri-
mental to the tyre. If anything it has
rather the opposite effect; it prevents
the tyre from bulging under load,
thus protecting the fabric in the wall.
The most common cause of wheel-
spin is overloading, or one or more
of the following: Tyres only partly
filled with water, giving insufficient
tyre-weight on the ground; or tyre
pressure too high, causing the tyres
to stand up too straight, thus not
allowing the tread to make full and
proper contact with the ground. By
filling 100 p.c. gives the extra added
weight which is required to prevent
wheel-spin, as every 21b. of added
weight gives 11b. (approximately) ex-
tra drawbar pull without slip.
Ever since tyres have been intro-
duced on tractors it was generally
taken for granted that you could
not pull a greater load on tyres than
on grips, but you could pull your load
ip a gear higher. It appears that the
tractor-user now wants to load the
tractor to its full capacity in the
lower gears—that is, low or second.
To which G. Kratschmann, service-
station owner, of Cleveland, adds:
In 1940 I commenced to use pneu-
‘ matic-tyred tractors for contract
ploughing, using six McCormick
Farmalls (A. H. & M.). The first set
of rear tyres did not last any longer
than 1200 working hours, so I was
compelled to do something to get
better results. During this period I
observed a fair amount of shatter,
didder or bouncing under loads in
the rear wheels when pulling hard,
so I decided to fill the rear tyres com-
pletely by extracting all the air with
a gadget of my own, and got better
results immediately. There was better
pull, the machine was faster, better
on the driver; we get over 3000 hours
on tyres and can retread them. They
need practically no attention through
loss of pressure as the water won’t
penetrate through the tubes, and the
flexibility still remains in the tyres.
The Queensland Main Roads
Board has adopted 100 p.c. water
for its rbad-grader tyres. I be-
lieve over 100 farm tractors on
the Darling Downs are using 100
p.c. water in their tyres. As this
practice has been in operation
only since 1946, it is impossible
to state what the “crack-up” re-
suits will be, but up to the pre-
sent , time there are none on
record.

Penicillin for Mastitis.
“R.W.”: There are two types
of mastitis, the most common
streptococcal, the other staphy-
lococcal. It is impossible to
distinguish between the two ex-
cept by laboratory tests of milk,
p en icillin is remarkably effective
for strepto., but less so for
staphy. Thus, if treatment of m-
fected cows is being done with-
ouj- laboratory tests some
failures must be expected. It
was found that three doses of
penicillin, each of 25,000 units
a t 24-hour intervals, was most
effective, giving a 90 p.c. cure.
The earlier an infected quarter
is treated the greater the cow’s
chances of recovery. Delay not
onl y reduces the percentage of
cures but results in a progres-
sive loss of function, which may
not be restored when the infec-
tion is eliminated.
Penicillin for this purpose is
marketed in small collapsible
metal tubes, each containing
25,000 units suspended in a
bland vegetable oil. The con-
tents of a tube constitute one
dose for one quarter. The tubes
are capped and sterilised before
being filled. The screw-cap
should not be removed until im-
mediately before the nozzle is
to be inserted into the teat ori-
fice, Instructions for use:
(1) Wash udder thoroughly with
warm, soapy water or with warm
hypochlorite solution (Hoz. or three
tablespoonfuls of commercial sodium
hypochlorite to one gallon of warm
water). Wring out the wash cloth
and dry the udder. (2) Milk out the
infected quarter into a bucket con-
taining a disinfectant. (3) Swab the
teat orifice with clean cottonwool
saturated in methylated spirits. (4)
With clean hands remove the screw
cap from the tube without touching
the tapered nozzle. (5) Hold end of
teat firmly between thumb and first
finger and insert nozzle of tube into
the orifice. Squeeze the whole con-
tents of tube into teat. Hold teat
end firmly to prevent escape of peni-
cillin and gently massage teat upwards
to distribute penicillin into the milk
cistern. (6) Repeat after each after-
noon milking until at least three doses
have been given. The morning milk-
ing may be done as usual.
In streptococcal mastitis
elimination of infection is fol-
lowed by a marked improvement
in the appearance of the milk
and the condition of the quarter
two or three days after treat-
ment. In a small percentage a
second course of three doses
may be necessary. If the second
course fails staphylococcis may
be suspected, in which case
chance of recovery is more re-
mote. Mastitis cannot be satis-
factorily controlled by treatment
alone. Adequate shed hygiene
is absolutely essential.
Owners and Shearers.
“K.Mc.”: Graziers who com-
plain about shearers (B.
22/9/’4B) are not far wrong. My
experience: Shearer A called
one Saturday and agreed to re-
turn on the Monday afternoon
ready to start shearing on the
Tuesday morning. Monday
morning he wired to say he
wasn’t coming. Shearer B agreed
to come from a neighbor’s shed
when it cut out next day. He
’phoned that night to say the
shearing contractor had him tied
and wouldn’t release him. I
have since learned from another
shearer employed by the same
contractor that they are not
bound by agreement and can
leave after any shed cuts out if
they so wish. Shearer C turned
up as promised, but left half the
wool on the legs and around the
head and was a butcher.
A relative had two shearers
dump him without even the
courtesy of notifying him. A
neighbor had to sack a shearer
for rough work. Another had
to put some of his newly-
“shorn” sheep over the board

THE NEW LIQUID SHEEP DIP
incorporating “ Cammexane” Benzene Hexatblortde.
Containing the most effective isecti-
cide discovered for the purpose,
GAMALENE is a POSITIVE des-
troyer of keds (sheep ticks), body lice,
foot lice and blowflies. It remains
active in the wool long enough to
ensure the destruction of any eggs or
pupae which may not be eradicated at
the time of dipping.
Its high concentration means that 2\
gallons of GAMALENE will do the
same work for which at least 5 gallons
of ordinary liquid dip, or 100 lbs. of
powder dip, are required.
GAMALENE is one of the simplest
of all dips to use, and possesses many
remarkable features which must recom-
mend it to every sheep owner.
GAMALENE is a stable emulsion easy to pour and requires
no premixing before use.
Contains no ingredients of an acid or caustic nature, no
mineral oils or solvents and cannot injure the wool,
is retained in the wool after dipping, and is not washed out
by rain.
Highly concentrated, 1\ gallons of GAMALENE are
sufficient for 1000 gallons of wash.
Sickle Brand GAMALEN Eis packed in 10 pint tins—two per carton. One carton (2J gallons') is
sufficient to make 1000 gallons of wash.

Never has there been so much
money in the game for shearers
and never has their work been

Fistula.
“Will C”: Two bush
remedies that rarely fail are of
the blister type, (a) turpentine
and ( b ) kerosene. They should
be used immediately the swel-
ling starts, and they are painful,
being much more annoying to a
hack than to a draught-horse.
The horse being treated is likely
to be nervous and/or savage
when approached the day after
the first treatment.
But cases of fistula vary in
extent and severity, and a
remedy that has cured two or
three fistulas on one farm may
easily fail on the next. Skilled
treatment involves the use of the
surgeon’s knife, and, as often as
not, that and the months of
costly treatment that follow fail
to effect a cure.
Sydney Show Changes.
“C.S.”: They’re for the R.A.
Show next Easter, April 9-19, in
the presence of the King and
Queen. Loss of a cattle pavilion
by fire, restoration of which is
prevented by current shortages,
has compelled the limitation of
entries to three by any one ex-
hibitor in any one class. All
beef cattle must be certified t.b.-
free either by individual or
Government herd certificate.
Dairy and fat cattle are exempt,
but probably will not be after
the 1949 Show.
, Dual judging of fat steers has
been eliminated ; they’ll now be
judged on the hoof for prizes
and for further prizes as car-
cases, though to qualify for car-
case judging the beast must first
be judged on the hoof.
Schedules for the wine-and-
spirit section will soon be out.
There’ll be no wine champion-
ships next year because of the
Federal Viticultural Council’s
request that championships be
conducted only by the R.A.S. in
the particular State in which the
F.V.C.’s annual conference is
held. There’s an additional class
for white wine and special prize
for the best export wine.
Hints for the Farm.
“C.A.A.”: Most effective
treatment of tapeworm in dogs is
arecoline hydrobromide, dose de-
pending on size. For “toy” dogs
and puppies one dram is recom-
mended ; for small terriers two
to four 'drams; for kelpies and
dogs of similar size loz., and for
large sheepdogs and greyhounds
up to 2oz. Keep the dog tied
up until effects of the drug have
passed off.
“W. Court”: Try to avoid
excess growth in imported forage
grasses, since few of them like
being burned off. Graze the
growth short as fast as it comes
so that there is none to become
rank and tough, but don’t go
too far and overgraze the stand.
Molasses-grass appears to hate
fire more than any other grass I'
know. A single fire through a
strong stand of it may kill all
but a few roots. The least
damage is done to grasses by
fire when they are growing in a
damp or shady place, for there
the fire lacks the heat it has in
a dry, open place.
“Big Billy”: To make sure
that the edge of a reaping-hook
is sharpened at the correct angle,
the sharpening-stone should
move in constant contact with
the shoulder of the blade as well
as the edge. Don’t put the stone
on the flat side of the blade at
all, except to remove any metal
that has been burred over.
While doing this the stone should
be perfectly flat on the blade.
“T.F.”: Don’t put sawdust on
brooder floors (B. 22/9/’4B).
Shavings are all right, but day-
olds will pick up anything, and
many a chick has died from saw-
dust impaction.
“Elah”: To creosote wooden
fence-posts all you need are two
oil-drums, creosote and som&
used sump-oil. Prepare a mix-
ture of four parts of creosote
and one part of sump-oil. Fill
each drum with enough solution
to cover the posts to a height of
Prop up one drum and
build a fire beneath it; then
stand a post on end in this con-
tainer and heat for about three
hours, keeping the creosote solu-
tion just under boiling-point. At
the end of this period remove
the post and plunge it into the
unheated mixture in the other
drum. Deep penetration of the
creosote will result.

BRIAN BUREAU.
Logical.
“In a Note to Britain, the U.S. and
France, Russia proposes that the four
Foreign Ministers meet to discuss the
problem of Germany as a whole.”
“Well,” said Bevin bluntly.
“You say you want us here to
discuss the German problem as
a whole. That suits us, doesn’t
it, Marshall? It's what we’ve
been trying to get you to do for
three years. Now we’re all here
and agreed, let’s get straight on
with it.”
“Yep,” agreed Marshall;
“Yep—pronto.”
Molotov pulled thoughtfully
at his moustache. “The Soviet
view,” he began, “is that it isn t
correct to discuss a German
settlement as a whole before the
Berlin problem is solved. More-
over, we regard this bringing-up
of the German problem as a
whole as a Western trick de-
signed to pull the wool over the
Soviet’s eyes while the West is
making a military bastion of
Western Germany so that with
their Nazi friends they can pre-
pare a springboard for an attack
on the U.S.S.R.”
Bevin raised his eyes to the
ceiling as if in silent prayer to
give him strength. “It was your
suggestion that we discuss the
German problem as a whole, not
ours,” he barked.
“That’s not the point,” went
on Molly, “It cuts across the
directive given under the Pots-
dam agreement.

“This'll cost y ’ three bob—a deener extra for

sued, “to the intransigence of
the Western Powers, their policy
of side-stepping frank and direct
Russian questions, and the intro-
duction of their own currency in
their Berlin zones whilst un-
reasonably refusing to accept
Russian currency as the sole per-
missible currency for the whole
of Berlin.”
“Stick to the point,” said
Bevin. “You ask us here to dis-
cuss the whole German problem.
We accept, and are here, pre-
pared to discuss it. You’re not.”
“That,” said Molly indignantly,
“is directly contrary to the
known circumstances. The
Soviet is prepared—in fact,
eager—to discuss with the West
the ever-increasing problem of
the blackmarket in the foui
Berlin zones of butchers’ hooks,
dog-collars and cornplasters. If
you refuse to discuss that ques-
tion the fault surely cannot be
laid at the door of the U.S.S.R.”
“But, dammit!” exploded
Marshall. “We want nothing
better than to discuss Germany
as a whole, once and for all!”
“To do that,” said Molly,
“would gravely weaken the
structure of the Atlantic Charter
and completely wreck the spirit
of the Yalta agreement. The
West, it seems, conveniently for-
gets, unlike the Soviet, the
necessity to honor international
agreements.”
“Now, look,” cut in Bevin.
“Answer this frankly— do you
want to discuss the German
problem as a whole?”
“The overall view of the
Soviet Government,” said Molly
blandly, “is that the Berlin air-
lift is a direct infringement of
the Protocol entered into in
April, nineteen forty-six, and all
amendments made since. We
feel that until all action is
unanimous by the four occupy-
ing Powers, discussion would
not only be futile but would
tend to put the Soviet at a grave
disadvantage.”
“Well, that’s what we’re here
for —to reach unanimity with the
Soviet on Germany,” said Mar-
shall. “If you’re willing let’s get
right ahead with it.”
“That,” objected Molly,
“would be contrary to the direc-
tive sent to the four Com-
manders-in-Chief in Berlin on
August the thirtieth last It
would create a dangerous pre-
cedent.”
“But,” despaired Bevin, “how
can we settle the German prob-
lem if you won’t discuss it after
inviting us here to discuss it?”
“The idea of reaching unani-
mity on Germany,” went on
Molly, “is patently a tortuous
Western scheme- to rob the
Soviet of any advantage it may
have —the real aim of the West
is clear —to encircle the Soviet
and its peace-loving neighbors
with threats of aggression.”
“Well,” said Marshall to
Bevin, picking up his satchel,
“we might as well push on. It
doesn’t seem as if he wants to
discuss Germany as a whole.”
Molotov turned to Vyshinsky
and shrugged his shoulders.
“You see?” he asked resignedly.
“This is what I have had all
along from the West: tergiversa-
tion, evasions, vagueness, insin-
cerity, unyielding hostility to
peaceful Soviet suggestions, ac-
cusations, insinuations, bad
faith —all governed by surly
and unworthy suspicions of
motives which are the purest.”

Western minds,” agreed Vyshin-
sky, “is that they can’t think

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Return of Christendom
If it is true that the characteristic note
of the 18th century was the development
of modern capitalism, and of the 19th
century the emergence of materialist, re-
actionary Communism, it is almost cer-
tainly true that the characteristic note of
the 20th century will be the re-establish-
ment of Christendom, or the Christian
frontier against paganism.
Something like 47 years of the 20th
century had passed before even the first
faint premonitory shadows of Christen-
dom appeared, but those shadows are
already falling lengthily across Western
Europe, with profound significance to the
world civilisation which has been built
upon the Christian ethic.
It is, indeed, perhaps somewhat daring
to see in the proposals for Western Union
and the talks about a European Parlia-
ment the beginnings of a vast new move-
ment in the Christian world ; yet this
is what lies behind an apparently merely
political stabilisation against the march
of European Communism.
The one certain thing is that Com-
munism will not be countered either on
political or economic lines, or a com-
bination of both ; in essence it represents
a moral or spiritual issue deeper even
than the cleavage between the Cross and
the Crescent of the Middle Ages. That,
indeed, was a struggle between two faiths,
but the cleavage between the Cross and
the Hammer stands for a struggle be-
tween a faith and a faithlessness.
It is more than 400 years since the
unity of Christendom was destroyed amid
the upsurge of European nationalism. We
live today in the fiercest cataclysm which
that nationalism has brought upon the
earth, but as with so many great his-
torical movements, in the midst of its
supreme expression, nationalism is already
on the wane.
It will not pass quickly or lightly. It
would not pass at all but for the enemy
that is upon it. But that enemy, atheistic
materialism expressed through Com-
munism, is urgent and deadly, and be-
cause it is not itself a nationalist force,,
it cannot be met along the frontiers of
militant nationalism. The smashing-down
of nationalist barriers among the nations
of Western Europe, so that they may
wage a concerted war both on the
spiritual and, if necessary, military level,
will be hastened in proportion to the
weight behind Communist expansion. We
need no convincing that this weight is
immediate and onerous.
Proposals for Western Union and a
European Parliament in themselves step
past rigid nationalism, however little
their architects may see the inevitable
culmination of their plans. Years or
decades may stand between us and the
restoration of Christendom, depending
on the character of the struggle that lies
ahead, but the greatest triumph of the
20th century will be the re-creation of an
international order under Christian in-
spiration.
Those who understand the tempo of
historical change will not expect dramatic
events to happen overnight; organic
history does not express itself in news-
paper headings. But the map of the
future, emerging from 30 years of chaos,
is taking recognisable form. — Warden
(Q-).
Despotism
Under our present system of quasi-
socialism the penalties for “offences”
against bureaucracy become more severe
as days go by. In Perth four persons
were each fined £5O for offences against
building regulations: two because one
sold some building material without the
permission of the Housing Commission,
the other for buying it; the other two
for starting building operations without
the consent of the same body.
The Housing Commission is, of course,
acting within the law. But mark how
offences as well as penalties grow!
The whole trouble with the building
crisis, which makes the creation of such
“offences” necessary, just as every exten-
sion of socialism will bring in its train
further offences, is the placing of build-
ing under Governmental control.
After the 1914-18 war, in which Aus-
tralia with a much smaller population
lost twice as many men, building was
left in private hands, with the result that
there never was a crisis. Capable men
hopped in and got things going. Not
only were enough houses built for all de-
mands, but many big buildings, hospitals,
warehouses, factories and hotels went up
at the same time— Jay Marks (W.A.).
Australian Composers
I’m pleased that the Government has
moved to assist Australian composers,
even though the meagre grant may barely
buy their score-sheets (B. 22/9/’4B). The
next step should be to encourage the
performance of Australian works. The
minute dose administered by A.B.C. (two
per cent, of broadcast time, I believe) is
not enough.
At least one body is proving that there
is an appetite for Australian works and
is gaining a reputation for its perform-
ances. Sydney’s North Shore Choral
Society and Symphony Orchestra last year
revived the long - neglected cantata
“Tawaki,” by Alfred Hill, with un-
qualified success. This year they are
presenting two cantatas, both first per-
formances —Dulcie Holland’s “Circle of
the Year” and Frank Hutchens’s “North-
East Wind.” The conductor, Alan Bell-
house, wants to hear of an Australian
work for next year,—R. G. N. (N.S.W.).
Science and Food
Scientists in the C.S.I.R. and the
Waite Institute have been collaborat-
ing in investigations which have led to
discoveries of tremendous significance.
They have found that vast areas of the
“Whaddaya doin' — puttin' a box-pleat in it?"
earth’s soil may not be of low fertility,
but merely lacking in minute traces of
certain elements, mainly copper, cobalt,
manganese, molybdenum and zinc.
Overseas experiments showed that the
absence of traces of copper and zinc from
some classes of soils retarded plant
growth. Following this lead investigators
found that the cause of the “grey-speck”
disease in crops of oats near Mt. Gambier
(S.A.) was absence of manganese in the
soil. Upon the inclusion of a few pounds
of this element in the superphosphate oat
crops responded with vigorous and
healthy growth.
Then came investigations into the cause
of the “coast sickness” which made it
impossible to graze sheep for any length
of time on the calcareous soils of some
coastal areas of S.A. If left there stock
wasted and died; breeding was impos-
sible. The trouble was traced to the
absence of minute quantities of cobalt
and copper. When these deficiences were
made good, either by topdressing or by
salt-licks including copper and cobalt, the
stock were as healthy as those grazed else-
where. Later came the discovery that
small quantities of molybdenum applied
to the soil would cause a phenomenal
increase in pasture growth in other areas.
In commercial forestry it was found that
the application of a little zinc caused
stunted patches of pinus radiata to grow
as vigorously as trees anywhere in the
plantations.
Finally came the question of the in-
fluence of these discoveries on human
health. It had already been found that
the prevalence of goitre in certain areas
was caused by the absence of iodine in
food or water. Sufficient work has now
been done to indicate that human beings
may respond to element-deficiency being
made good in the same way as have
animals.
Then there is control of erosion. Un-
aided, nature takes up to 1000 yearsi to
rebuild a few inches of topsoil, but a
raw subsoil, stripped of all its topsoil by
wind and water, can be restored to full
fertility in as little as 10 years by (1)
contour-ploughing, (2) the sowing of a
legume such as clover to transfer nitrogen
from the air to the soil, (3) the encourag-
ing of legume growth by phosphatic
manures to which have been added small
quantities of the missing but vital trace
elements, and (4) rotational grazing by
livestock, whose manure helps to add
water-retaining humus to the soil.
In recognition of what the C.S.I.R. and
the Waite Institute have accomplished in
S.A., the British Commonwealth specialist
conference on climate and animal nutri-
tion will be held in Adelaide next year,
but the men and women who are doing
the indispensable field- and research-work
need all the help Australia can give them.
Their main requirements are funds with
which to carry on so that they will not
need to practise false economy, and time
in which to do their work.
Farmers are finding it so profitable to
follow their advice that much of the
scientists’ time is taken up with explain-
ing discoveries instead of going ahead
with research.
Newspapers could help them by em-
ploying journalists who can read through
research reports, select the important
points and put them into everyday
language for readers, Adelaide “Adver-
tiser” and “Chronicle” have given other
newspapers a good lead by employing a
man who can and does give the full and
correct interpretation.
Funds can best be augmented by dona-
tions or bequests, and there is no better
way of encouraging such contributions to
human welfare than by making them
free of all forms of taxation. They often
possess what Government grants lack —
inspiration. The Waite Institute itself
came into being because the late Peter
Waite donated the land and the money
which enabled it to make a start. Other
families whose names are linked with the
pastoral and agricultural history ..of Aus-
tralia followed his lead with handsome
contributions. — H. A. Lindsay (S.A.).
T.B.
In its fight against t.b. the Victorian
Government has established a clinic at
Melbourne with three permanent doctors
and eight travelling nurses. There are
also country clinics and chalets and, since
voluntary X-ray examinations began five
years ago, 300,000 people have been
tested. Sufferers are given a reasonable
allowance and a man with a wife and
two children can, from various services,
draw up to £6 ss. a week.
All schoolteachers are examined at the
beginning of their training and again at
the finish of it. While serving as teachers
they are given skin tests. Children, par-
ticularly, are sought by the specialists, the
idea being that healthy children make
healthy adults. Working along this line
they hope to wipe out the scourge in
from two to three decades.
All this makes one wonder at the
apathy of the N. S. Wales Government.
Surely the Ma State can do something
along Victorian lines. —D. E. W. (N.S.W.).
New States
In his prophecy (B, 22/9/’4B) that the
New-State movement in New England
will come to nothing, “T.P.V.” is as wide
of the mark as the enthusiast who pre-
dicted it would be a reality in five years.
Neither »the pessimism nor the optimism
is justified; the new State —the first of
many—will come as a natural conse-
quence of the deep-seated movement
in New England nonetheless real be-
cause it is not the subject of gossip at
every street-corner.
New States in a vague general way
have been talked about for many years,
but as yet it is scarcely two decades since
the New England movement first took
any real shape.
The New-State movement will follow
the pattern of Federation. “T.P.V.”
might remember that Federation was
under discussion for nearly half a century
before it was crowned with success; that
for 20 years or more it was scoffed at by
the knowalls even while earnest and far-
thinking men in public and private life
were weighing up its merits ; and that
even after Henry Parkes gave it a dynamic
popular life in 1889, yet another decade
had to pass before Federation was at-
tained. Indeed Parkes might have died in
the belief or fear that his Federal move-
ment had failed, for by the mid-’nineties
it had lost some of its 1889 momentum,
and lived only because Barton, Deakin
and company regathered the reins.
Political changes of this magnitude
take a longer cycle than the average poli-
tical issue. I agree with “T.P.V.” that
new States have not yet become a popular
movement, but a Henry Parkes will come.
—Dee (Q.).
Lead
With exporters raking in £7O per ton
for scrap lead, it’s almost impossible to
buy sheet lead, especially the 6in.-wide
21b. variety used for weathering box-
frames in fibro houses.
Yesterday, my ironmonger said, in
reply to my request for sheet lead, “I’m
beginning to forget what it looks like.”
“Well, what about 24in. 6jlh. sash-
weights?” I asked.
“Yes. I’ve got some, but not 6|lb.
You can have 7ib.”
“What’s the use of 71b. weights to me?”
I said. “I can’t chop a pound off each
iron weight.”
“These are not iron, mister, they're
lead. They have been making leaden sash-
weights for months past now.” — Ognop
(N.S.W.).
The Root of the Matter
While the proposed increase in pensions
will automatically benefit all pensioners
under the Consolidated Social Services
Act, other amendments to the Act are
still overdue. Provision is needed urgently
to cover all cases of invalid pensioners
on special diets, such as diabetics and
t.b. patients. While these invalids are in
hospitals their diet is carefully checked
and the correct foods supplied. When
the pensioners are discharged from hos-
pitals.and sanatoriums they still have their
special diet charts, but the pension, already
less than the basic wage, is not sufficient
to buy the special foods. The problem
must be tackled and a workable scheme
set up (cash or goods) for invalids to
obtain the foods essential for their re-
covery.—Jen (S.A.). .
Much of the blame for the shortage of
nurses can be laid at the door of unions
and the daily press for painting a rather
terrifying picture of the profession. Be-
fore unions and agitators got to work
nurses were, generally, a rather contented
body of young women, a big percentage
of them coming from wealthy and near-
wealthy families. Conditions were cer-
tainly never a bed of roses, but the nurses
were very healthy young women, living
on plain wholesome food and deriving
some satisfaction from their work. To-
day, we have had painted such a gloomy
picture of nursing and nurses’ conditions
that young women are afraid to enter
the profession, feeling that there are better
conditions and bigger wages in a jam
factory.—W. P. T. (N.S.W.).
The new Land Sales Control Act
(N.S.W.) lays it down that the Minister
is not to refuse his consent to any trans-
action, except to give effect to a policy
of preventing or limiting increases in
prices of land —Section 3 (13). Very nice,
but almost alongside is slipped in another
paragraph—Section 3 (11): “Where an
applicant for consent to purchase any
land on which is erected a dwelling-house
has informed the Minister that he intends
to live in the dwelling-house, the appli-
cant shall not, without the consent in
writing of the Minister, let the land.”
There is no time-limit on this embargo,
so, if you buy a house for the purpose
of letting it and squeezing rent out of the
suffering proletariat, it’s yours without
any strings. If you buy it as a roof for
the wife and family, you get a heavy blot
on the title, and if you get a move to
another town you can either sell again or
leave your family, unless, of course, the
Minister graciously consents to your let-
ting.—F. H. (N.S.W.).
The number of trained firemen at N. S.
Wales country fire-stations is to be re-
duced and their duties transferred to
volunteers. The Fire Brigade is a Gov-
ernment outfit, but the Government only
pays 25 per cent, of the upkeep. Muni-
cipal councils are billed for another 25
per cent, and insurance companies pay
the rest. It is time the service was put
on the same basis as the police and other
public-service bodies. If the Government
can compel insurance companies to foot
part of the bill, that’s all right, but to
expect volunteers to do the dirty work is
too much. Imagine the mess the com-
munity would be in if the police had to
rely on volunteers to help them.—R. W.
(N.S.W.).

Britain’s amazing Ferguson System is here I It’s the
most efficient and economical method of farming ever
devised. The Ferguson is a complete mechanised
farming system—tractor and implement working
together as a single integral unit by means of 3-point
linkage and Automatic Hydraulic Control. In both
large and small scale farming, the Ferguson System
will save YOU time, work and money. Ferguson
will do EVERY job on your farm ... at a low cost.
It’s the most adaptable and mobile farming unit
ever produced.
The lightweight Ferguson tractor employs natural laws
to provide traction and
ţ
penetration, eliminating
the use of heavy in-built
weight. The outstanding
feature of the Ferguson
System is 3-Point Linkage.
This controls the operation
of the implement, and
enables tractor and implement to work as one.
Three-Point Linkage converts the resistance of the
soil on the implement, into a strong forward and
downward thrust, thus eliminating any risk of front

a wide range of specially
designed implements
merely a matter of seconds.
Ferguson “finger-tip” hy-
draulic control enables you
to lift, lower or set an implement without leaving
the tractor seat, and ensures that the implement
maintains a constant working depth on all types of
ground.
Costly implement repair bills are eliminated, for when
the implement strikes a hidden obstruction, the
hydraulic control throws all the weight off the rear
wheels immediately . . . preventing damage to both
tractor and implement. The specially designed imple-
